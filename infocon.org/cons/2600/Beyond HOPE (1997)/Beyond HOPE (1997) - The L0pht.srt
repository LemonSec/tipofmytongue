all

14
00:02:17,790 --> 00:02:21,739
we all hooked up

15
00:02:21,739 --> 00:02:26,260
okay we're set oo alright on

16
00:02:26,260 --> 00:02:29,079
greetings the those that are still awake
and not completely chemically

17
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:31,020
intoxicated out in the other room I

18
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:34,920
hacking and every other boxes coming up
on the network we are

19
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:39,250
%uh the law you can get to as a law dot
com I have some %uh view of our diverse

20
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:40,280
I love you might not have

21
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:43,840
we're going to be talking to you today
for an hour gonna do our best to keep it

22
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:44,810
directly at an hour

23
00:02:44,810 --> 00:02:48,180
everybody's anxious to get on to the
next things and were being followed by

24
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:49,270
Bruce Schneier which is

25
00:02:49,270 --> 00:02:53,160
fucking rad on

26
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:56,790
what we're going to talk about here
today is we're going to give you a brief

27
00:02:56,790 --> 00:02:57,590
background

28
00:02:57,590 --> 00:03:01,200
on the law on why were there what we're
doing

29
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:04,500
I'll why company should stop persecuting
us

30
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:11,480
now we're helping everybody the

31
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:14,400
and that hackers are probably the best
thing that america has going for it

32
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:15,000
right now

33
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,520
damn straight

34
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:20,730
we have won through up the different
members introduce them to the lot of

35
00:03:20,730 --> 00:03:21,460
people know

36
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:24,440
know probably me more than the other
people in the loft and and that's not

37
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:25,070
how the law

38
00:03:25,070 --> 00:03:28,510
works by any means I just happen to be a
media whore Anna

39
00:03:28,510 --> 00:03:32,590
we're gonna run through talk about some
the different projects that are going on

40
00:03:32,590 --> 00:03:33,620
and

41
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:36,430
and at the end up we have time can just
flying through the loft crack

42
00:03:36,430 --> 00:03:40,209
presentation slides on why you should
not trust Microsoft crypto

43
00:03:40,209 --> 00:03:45,330
on because we've got enough requests for
so let me go into the background on

44
00:03:45,330 --> 00:03:48,549
what the loft is what we're kinda doing
out there

45
00:03:48,549 --> 00:03:52,360
on the best description I've gotten

46
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:56,470
of the law other then got a mother
fucking hackers breaking in the system's

47
00:03:56,470 --> 00:04:00,250
the lamb major daughters type ordeal is

48
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:04,530
a consumer watch group Anthony said it
to me as a

49
00:04:04,530 --> 00:04:08,829
okay yes

50
00:04:08,829 --> 00:04:12,280
people are selling you stop people are
selling the company that you work for

51
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:15,829
products and solutions and they're going
to trust us

52
00:04:15,829 --> 00:04:19,289
well i 'em because it secure

53
00:04:19,289 --> 00:04:24,039
why is it secure because we say sell

54
00:04:24,039 --> 00:04:30,490
now wrong answer the advisories page
that one up a little while ago has been

55
00:04:30,490 --> 00:04:31,960
some exploit stop

56
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:36,479
that goes around I as we find them we
tried to originally contact most the

57
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:37,680
vendors about them first

58
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:41,550
the offenders a really didn't care they
came back to us

59
00:04:41,550 --> 00:04:45,849
one large company in Massachusetts who
does one-time passwords

60
00:04:45,849 --> 00:04:48,919
at actually we approached them about a
year ago

61
00:04:48,919 --> 00:04:54,359
by about two years ago now and we said
we found a whole bunch applause

62
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:57,500
in your product and anybody using your
cards

63
00:04:57,500 --> 00:05:01,160
I is at risk you know these blogs that
we don't have any flaws

64
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:04,190
so we sent them back at Dom's

65
00:05:04,190 --> 00:05:09,000
we showed us breaking in the system that
we had legitimate access to do this to

66
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:13,340
saying you still have these flaws do you
believe us now as a to allow

67
00:05:13,340 --> 00:05:16,510
how many of our customers know about
this

68
00:05:16,510 --> 00:05:20,760
I don't know we found anybody else could
find it too

69
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:24,120
we can go tell your customers we want to
you sadat

70
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:28,070
good they refused to do anything about
it

71
00:05:28,070 --> 00:05:31,360
they kept going to customers that there
weren't any problems and everything so

72
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:35,349
we gave up on that track now we
basically posted so that the bad guys

73
00:05:35,349 --> 00:05:36,690
the good guys the whatever

74
00:05:36,690 --> 00:05:40,469
on the bad guys being the company's the
guys being the hackers

75
00:05:40,470 --> 00:05:45,159
get access to the stuff at the same time
and all of a sudden their customers star

76
00:05:45,159 --> 00:05:47,210
complaining and that makes the company's

77
00:05:47,210 --> 00:05:50,770
stop and fix things that the just behind
the advisories page

78
00:05:50,770 --> 00:05:56,380
we've we've had a long history in the
hacking underground call CDC in ATT and

79
00:05:56,380 --> 00:06:00,330
great freakin Boston boys the later

80
00:06:00,330 --> 00:06:04,300
go out to the west coast whatever
traders

81
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:08,370
kate is a little more Maria

82
00:06:08,370 --> 00:06:11,900
on we have the all black crawling
systems

83
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:15,860
archives which is a bulletin board from
my black fine oblivion for a long time

84
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:19,650
increase in history I CDC's star

85
00:06:19,650 --> 00:06:26,150
up just amazing and week which I keep a
decent repository up there

86
00:06:26,150 --> 00:06:30,150
other things that we're doing is R&D in
the harbor side of things we haven't

87
00:06:30,150 --> 00:06:33,880
really decent hardware group inside the
loft I think that's one of the things

88
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:34,490
that really

89
00:06:34,490 --> 00:06:38,039
spreads apart are mother thinks we've
got on

90
00:06:38,039 --> 00:06:41,700
run oblivion kingpin over they are just
the freakin whizzes wanna come smart

91
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:46,250
cards pox eg decoder kits maybe you seen
some of those things

92
00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:49,719
%uh I guess there was a some red box of
our detection unit

93
00:06:49,719 --> 00:06:53,800
cinematic a kingpin came up with but
that was kinda ironic

94
00:06:53,800 --> 00:07:00,279
com was a and then wait then we come out
with tools we like to give back to the

95
00:07:00,279 --> 00:07:00,779
community

96
00:07:00,779 --> 00:07:04,590
a lot of people have come up to us and
said well you know

97
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:08,560
what is the loft offering us and on the
cover on the front it's like what is you

98
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:11,099
can get a shell account here you can get
a web page here

99
00:07:11,099 --> 00:07:15,050
or you can email address here that

100
00:07:15,050 --> 00:07:18,400
that's not the reason behind it the
thing is we pay for this thing entirely

101
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:19,529
on our pockets

102
00:07:19,529 --> 00:07:22,740
we don't mind we like it this is
something we love doing we will always

103
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:25,599
be doing this thing until they throw it
behind bars which hopefully they won't

104
00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:25,990
do

105
00:07:25,990 --> 00:07:30,719
because we're not doing anything wrong
and

106
00:07:30,719 --> 00:07:35,060
if you ever see PBS and PBS says you
know Sanderson fifty dollars we'll send

107
00:07:35,060 --> 00:07:36,200
you back a bumper sticker

108
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:39,110
you're not spending 50 bucks for the
bumper sticker you're plugging it back

109
00:07:39,110 --> 00:07:42,070
in the people of the fan running to try
and give back to the community

110
00:07:42,070 --> 00:07:45,650
you wanna do a great if not all the
stuff is always up there will always be

111
00:07:45,650 --> 00:07:46,120
free

112
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:50,080
with that I'm gonna start going through
a little introduction

113
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:53,508
the people running a lady to them talk
for a few minutes

114
00:07:53,509 --> 00:07:56,669
and if we have time oh well the co
author a block crack

115
00:07:56,669 --> 00:08:00,150
and I are gonna whip through the lock
representation on how to

116
00:08:00,150 --> 00:08:04,190
how to be Microsoft crypto so without
further ado let me start running down

117
00:08:04,190 --> 00:08:05,020
the line here

118
00:08:05,020 --> 00:08:08,169
on just briefly by names and

119
00:08:08,169 --> 00:08:11,639
you wanna go on endure a actual talks
are you want to

120
00:08:11,639 --> 00:08:18,639
sure okay filed mister Brian oblivion

121
00:08:19,150 --> 00:08:24,680
hi prolly mostly known me for the
brockbank growing systems

122
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:28,750
just something I sorta kept going after
in the PBS

123
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:33,328
I'll I gotta lotta mail saying links are
broken please fix this

124
00:08:33,329 --> 00:08:36,990
um I've I really need to talk to some
people are having problems with that

125
00:08:36,990 --> 00:08:37,448
because

126
00:08:37,448 --> 00:08:41,289
when I tried it works fine and

127
00:08:41,289 --> 00:08:45,709
I think most is coming from AOL but I
really want to fix this

128
00:08:45,709 --> 00:08:49,790
send me some some him an hour or talk to
me after the

129
00:08:49,790 --> 00:08:53,319
the show on the other hardware projects
I'm working on

130
00:08:53,319 --> 00:08:56,510
missus wifi calling systems mostly gets
pushed

131
00:08:56,510 --> 00:08:59,930
to the side is showing I'm

132
00:08:59,930 --> 00:09:03,930
mostly worked hard for projects together
and

133
00:09:03,930 --> 00:09:08,010
for working on a universal a coder to
decode not only park site which

134
00:09:08,010 --> 00:09:11,209
original public domain circuit did quite

135
00:09:11,209 --> 00:09:14,640
Creek quick quite well for how simple it
was we want to come up with something

136
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:15,620
along the lines

137
00:09:15,620 --> 00:09:19,440
as the it was a really Electronix

138
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:23,800
article did with the pic chip but I
think for any something a little more

139
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:25,980
powerful than a pic chip to decode

140
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:30,060
flax reflex which is the two-way

141
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:34,300
aging protocol rose coming out with and
we'd also like to do

142
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:37,689
move attacks smartest stuff as well as
the

143
00:09:37,689 --> 00:09:41,819
police MDT decoders

144
00:09:41,819 --> 00:09:45,750
I aside from that project I'm also
worked with some other hackers up in the

145
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:47,449
Boston area

146
00:09:47,449 --> 00:09:51,050
on record housing it's the pasta my list
signal

147
00:09:51,050 --> 00:09:57,550
I'm sorry special interest group and
we're trying to put together a

148
00:09:57,550 --> 00:10:00,720
a free wireless network

149
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:05,319
for our Moshi the underground and we're
having trouble trying to establish

150
00:10:05,319 --> 00:10:09,360
nodes in the Upromise the stuff cost
dollars

151
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:12,510
dollars

152
00:10:12,510 --> 00:10:15,939
were mainly in the R&D phase right now
and we're trying to

153
00:10:15,939 --> 00:10:19,189
network with other people to hopefully
set up some point

154
00:10:19,189 --> 00:10:22,349
presence across United States 13 growing

155
00:10:22,350 --> 00:10:26,050
past already face right now working with

156
00:10:26,050 --> 00:10:31,430
Doctor Who time I dwn method

157
00:10:31,430 --> 00:10:35,910
they've really helped a lot I wouldn't
be where it is today

158
00:10:35,910 --> 00:10:41,459
which just means and well actually

159
00:10:41,459 --> 00:10:44,620
I think that's about it I moved over to
Joe

160
00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:48,069
weekend talk more about pilot tax

161
00:10:48,069 --> 00:10:52,280
US robotics comp file think lots of
people in the audience using these

162
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:53,870
things I think it's a

163
00:10:53,870 --> 00:10:57,250
pretty hot ticket come up with some

164
00:10:57,250 --> 00:11:04,250
sorta hacking tools

165
00:11:06,149 --> 00:11:09,350
hi I I'm kingpin I'm one of the guys
doing

166
00:11:09,350 --> 00:11:12,519
hardware development embedded systems to

167
00:11:12,519 --> 00:11:16,760
I as Ryan said we been working with the
US Robotics palm pilots

168
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:20,260
for a a little bit just playing around
with them getting a feel for them if

169
00:11:20,260 --> 00:11:21,850
nobody's ever seen them before

170
00:11:21,850 --> 00:11:25,720
should look in any electronics magazine
see an article about

171
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:29,230
organ look up here see this on

172
00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:32,390
as a general overview the pilot is based
on them

173
00:11:32,390 --> 00:11:36,189
Motorola Dragonball processor which I
60,000 family

174
00:11:36,190 --> 00:11:39,480
and that's fell specifically for PDA use

175
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:44,690
and it's very powerful clocked at sixty
megahertz has

176
00:11:44,690 --> 00:11:48,040
Louis interface to PCMCIA pot

177
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:53,540
external box I can flex decoding IC's
infrared communications and LCD display

178
00:11:53,540 --> 00:11:54,870
so it's a really powerful chip

179
00:11:54,870 --> 00:11:58,079
which makes it attractive to hack with

180
00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:02,690
I am and which was a pilot for a number
of reasons because I

181
00:12:02,690 --> 00:12:06,600
small is low cost and a lot of people
seem to have them and a

182
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:09,709
as I said the hardware design is really
great for hacking

183
00:12:09,709 --> 00:12:13,190
I am there's two areas that were

184
00:12:13,190 --> 00:12:17,310
they're gonna modified on the pilot
would allow easy access to the Dragon

185
00:12:17,310 --> 00:12:18,100
Ball internals

186
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:22,300
without having to rip open the file in
play with all the ServiceMaster

187
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:26,510
as the HotSync connect on the bottom
which used to pick up to

188
00:12:26,510 --> 00:12:29,600
pick up to the desktop machine in the
modem to

189
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:33,589
to you transfer your data and is also
members on the back so

190
00:12:33,589 --> 00:12:38,270
that's how we'll do a lot of
modifications basins

191
00:12:38,270 --> 00:12:42,180
guarantees real quick the first is I
infrared in those be wireless

192
00:12:42,180 --> 00:12:43,079
communications

193
00:12:43,079 --> 00:12:47,110
we're gonna have some probably just
point to point our

194
00:12:47,110 --> 00:12:51,180
maybe just a while a sweetheart secure
data CEOs have to be connected to a

195
00:12:51,180 --> 00:12:55,120
to it to a desktop machine Anna

196
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:58,660
important tools with that we're hoping i
doing a summer network security auditing

197
00:12:58,660 --> 00:12:59,250
tools

198
00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:02,860
and out basically wanted turn the pilot
into a

199
00:13:02,860 --> 00:13:07,410
very portable auditing tool which were
allowed network slipping and maybe some

200
00:13:07,410 --> 00:13:09,050
basic vulnerability probing

201
00:13:09,050 --> 00:13:12,480
so something easy we can just a

202
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:16,690
pick up to the network and see what's
going on another one is %uh pilot the

203
00:13:16,690 --> 00:13:19,800
pilot communications which is something
that US Robotics never

204
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:23,949
put into their plan for some reason we
can exchange data back and forth and a

205
00:13:23,949 --> 00:13:28,660
it with infrared through cable so bright
and i cant read memos their wares there

206
00:13:28,660 --> 00:13:29,319
what everyone

207
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:34,420
and the final project is

208
00:13:34,420 --> 00:13:37,800
is part of what bryan said using the the
University coder

209
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:44,079
for the box Ag flex n the mobile data
terminal stuff basically just plug it in

210
00:13:44,079 --> 00:13:50,130
right to the bottom and have the serial
interface and with would be good and

211
00:13:50,130 --> 00:13:50,740
basically the

212
00:13:50,740 --> 00:13:54,300
the beauty of the pilot hacking is that
it involves everybody in the law

213
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:57,649
because the hardware/software sided
thing so we can all work together and

214
00:13:57,649 --> 00:14:00,899
work in a communal project in and
without you guys

215
00:14:00,899 --> 00:14:05,760
hopefully something good will come about
it taking thing can you tell them

216
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:08,360
exactly what the parts I can flex
decoding in the

217
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:11,480
the Palm Pilot let them do I'm sure a
lot of people out there that aren't

218
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:12,290
exactly where

219
00:14:12,290 --> 00:14:16,910
are taken like to say really are eiffel
basically pot pot I complexity

220
00:14:16,910 --> 00:14:21,899
page protocols and in anode their spots
like to go to software out there we had

221
00:14:21,899 --> 00:14:24,230
a kid that we sold it basically allows
you to just

222
00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:27,940
received it the data transmissions with
the scanner in

223
00:14:27,940 --> 00:14:31,720
hook it up to the decoder in basically
monitor all pages transmissions

224
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:36,050
an awesome people on the net released
some software for mobile data terminals

225
00:14:36,050 --> 00:14:37,600
to the police terms in the cars

226
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:41,230
in the police cars which you can watch

227
00:14:41,230 --> 00:14:44,680
NCIC database accessing things like that
and that's a

228
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:49,290
has become a pretty hot topic so using

229
00:14:49,290 --> 00:14:54,620
the pilot which which has very good
support for the box a complex decoder IC

230
00:14:54,620 --> 00:14:56,560
switch motor law so makes weaken

231
00:14:56,560 --> 00:15:00,329
hopefully do something with that which
bases like the radio and made

232
00:15:00,329 --> 00:15:04,360
receive pages on the file instead upon
on laptop for

233
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:11,360
big test option and we can use a pilot
has abated

234
00:15:11,990 --> 00:15:16,230
said

235
00:15:16,230 --> 00:15:23,230
thanks space row

236
00:15:24,610 --> 00:15:26,690
space program Macintosh user

237
00:15:26,690 --> 00:15:32,230
the one India

238
00:15:32,230 --> 00:15:35,600
things to do with the loft are couple
couple things

239
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:39,110
what's up much hardware hacks I have
missing my pages

240
00:15:39,110 --> 00:15:43,400
basically modifying Apple's hardware
into doing stuff

241
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:47,400
house putting green to

242
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:51,720
thats that's one thing I do not think I
do

243
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:55,580
disrupts your is I Minister the black
Mac archives FTP site

244
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:58,940
mom which is basically a very large
collection

245
00:15:58,940 --> 00:16:02,190
I'll mcintosh hacking tool

246
00:16:02,190 --> 00:16:05,700
prior to this I going up about

247
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:10,320
three years ago it was very difficult to
find more dialers

248
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:13,600
war other types tools for hacking on a
Mac

249
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:17,850
so one of the things I didn't put all
the files I had

250
00:16:17,850 --> 00:16:22,060
collected over the years into the FTP
site on it started out it was like 20

251
00:16:22,060 --> 00:16:22,560
minutes

252
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:26,220
whole lot attack I is now brought about

253
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:31,680
he makes ninety makes and all the all
the files are available free

254
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:34,790
don't charge for them there

255
00:16:34,790 --> 00:16:38,580
mostly shareware it's all legal software
that you can own

256
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:41,750
no commercial stuff on I get emailed

257
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:45,100
last where the wearer's sister

258
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:50,050
hacking tools there the FTP site was
very popular

259
00:16:50,050 --> 00:16:53,610
our first started kinda sucked our band
with down

260
00:16:53,610 --> 00:16:58,500
so I'll we had to limit the number users
that could get into it as a result of

261
00:16:58,500 --> 00:16:58,960
that

262
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:02,910
I want things I did or we did is
published the CD

263
00:17:02,910 --> 00:17:07,369
the CD contains all the files that were
on the website

264
00:17:07,370 --> 00:17:13,050
back in November last year that is to
allow people

265
00:17:13,050 --> 00:17:17,770
who didn't want to wait in line for the
five user FTP site to just buy the CD

266
00:17:17,770 --> 00:17:21,420
dolls as proved to be very popular

267
00:17:21,420 --> 00:17:25,589
but a lot of money into law we could use
to pay ISDN bill

268
00:17:25,589 --> 00:17:31,280
electric bill heating bill sorrow ran
stocks or other expensive so

269
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:35,540
with a camel active may or may not
appear the other things have

270
00:17:35,540 --> 00:17:40,020
I'm working on conjunction with Stephan
are ban on some apple software

271
00:17:40,020 --> 00:17:43,220
specifically the new software aperture I
P was just

272
00:17:43,220 --> 00:17:46,600
recently-released in one hour stephan
going to that

273
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:50,070
but that's so where we're looking at
software wise

274
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:53,120
there are holes in our of just need to
find them

275
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:56,120
as soon as we get some people want can
write up

276
00:17:56,120 --> 00:18:00,570
we will adviser with that I'll turn
overstepping to talk more about the

277
00:18:00,570 --> 00:18:01,800
Macintosh us of course

278
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:08,800
thanks are I'm stephan

279
00:18:09,110 --> 00:18:13,270
and I'm the other token Mac user I think
out to a few people had a 73 high

280
00:18:13,270 --> 00:18:14,379
percentage a Mac people

281
00:18:14,380 --> 00:18:17,960
me more and more than a quarter arm

282
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:21,350
I got a crossover between hot hardware
and the software because I'm responsible

283
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:22,780
for the infrastructure

284
00:18:22,780 --> 00:18:26,780
power distribution network topology our
backbone in our

285
00:18:26,780 --> 00:18:31,540
are lost sight the other water our PBX

286
00:18:31,540 --> 00:18:35,460
regatta which we trashed and repair now
to keep up

287
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:39,580
the loft I R live video feed out to keep

288
00:18:39,580 --> 00:18:43,280
tv3 to God G he was down so we can get
on the people

289
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:47,639
as important mean points don't
underestimates

290
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:51,980
the power company for data transmission
and was getting all hyped up about

291
00:18:51,980 --> 00:18:56,530
the the their regional bell operating
companies having competition now from

292
00:18:56,530 --> 00:18:59,730
the cable facilities cable modems a boy

293
00:18:59,730 --> 00:19:04,230
by people are overlooking the power
company power cabling goes into every

294
00:19:04,230 --> 00:19:04,940
facility

295
00:19:04,940 --> 00:19:09,520
right now you can get fourteen 4k over
conventional power lines

296
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:12,530
into any house and it's a shared medium

297
00:19:12,530 --> 00:19:16,040
just like a cable modems are but with
one advantage

298
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:20,200
to the hacker where the cable company
can slap TDR on your line

299
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:23,540
fine if you've tapped into the people
I'm electric company

300
00:19:23,540 --> 00:19:26,600
there's no way to monitor any tabs
electric line missus

301
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:30,590
is as if you were plugin a toaster so
with the transmission

302
00:19:30,590 --> 00:19:34,370
gonna when picking up over electric
lines that something to watch that's

303
00:19:34,370 --> 00:19:34,900
gonna be

304
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:39,520
a huge outlet for focusing action
resource the next issue of course

305
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:42,590
is Apple traditionally Apple has been
focused on

306
00:19:42,590 --> 00:19:45,668
AppleTalk protocols great for local area
networks

307
00:19:45,669 --> 00:19:49,929
of course AppleTalk is is not was
traversing the Internet by

308
00:19:49,929 --> 00:19:53,390
Apple's products now are breaking up for
the first time into

309
00:19:53,390 --> 00:19:57,840
Internet protocols their Apple share I P
which had been traditionally just

310
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:00,959
and Apple share using AppleTalk protocol

311
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:05,590
is now bringing on TCPIP there maybe
vulnerabilities there was ample

312
00:20:05,590 --> 00:20:08,980
unaware of not a lot of focus has gone
on to Apple's

313
00:20:08,980 --> 00:20:12,830
Apple share I P product so we need to
focus

314
00:20:12,830 --> 00:20:16,949
a lot of collective I mean our the loft
as well as the community

315
00:20:16,950 --> 00:20:20,620
hacking efforts on publisher ID it's got
all

316
00:20:20,620 --> 00:20:23,990
well-known port you could run a port
scanner against and I was right

317
00:20:23,990 --> 00:20:28,900
the server it'll be a very specific ID
up until Apple share ID was released

318
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:32,080
the only open port on the Apple IP stack

319
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:36,428
was for ICMP ping so you can not only
identify a Mac thats

320
00:20:36,429 --> 00:20:39,820
sitting with nothing running to the
stack but you can identify

321
00:20:39,820 --> 00:20:44,030
with a single more on a scan was your IP
server

322
00:20:44,030 --> 00:20:47,740
the other products besides the Apple
share IP server is the Apple network

323
00:20:47,740 --> 00:20:49,220
admin tool kit

324
00:20:49,220 --> 00:20:53,230
existing product for about a year and a
half they just gonna version 2.0

325
00:20:53,230 --> 00:20:56,340
integrating TCPIP all of my

326
00:20:56,340 --> 00:20:59,550
information is that the aversion to its
been rather slept together

327
00:20:59,550 --> 00:21:03,070
integrated IP into this product without
a lot of testing

328
00:21:03,070 --> 00:21:06,409
just add functionality overall and in
action

329
00:21:06,410 --> 00:21:10,710
again it's a well-known more well-known
port also become upwards candor usually

330
00:21:10,710 --> 00:21:14,360
and on the Apple adnan network admin
tool kit

331
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:17,419
passwords are stored in a central
registry akin to

332
00:21:17,419 --> 00:21:20,510
way UNIX systems gonna a password file

333
00:21:20,510 --> 00:21:24,480
in cryptid if on Apple network admin
tool if you can grab

334
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:28,510
the central password registry you got
admin control not only over

335
00:21:28,510 --> 00:21:32,190
box but over the network just in summary

336
00:21:32,190 --> 00:21:35,250
watch Apple because their products don't
have a lot of focus

337
00:21:35,250 --> 00:21:39,030
right now from 100 community and I think
that's going to be

338
00:21:39,030 --> 00:21:42,090
allowing them to sleep in some
vulnerabilities that

339
00:21:42,090 --> 00:21:45,168
me to find I am the

340
00:21:45,169 --> 00:21:49,520
investment from Microsoft's just
recently the millions that was put into

341
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:53,870
Apple coupled with the business
pressures on Apple right now

342
00:21:53,870 --> 00:21:58,370
this Microsoft investment it might be
something more than just trying to get

343
00:21:58,370 --> 00:22:02,060
Internet Explorer pre-installed on max
we may see some

344
00:22:02,060 --> 00:22:05,570
NT login authentication coming to a Mac
OS system

345
00:22:05,570 --> 00:22:08,928
and tell you that much 2.0 of the
obvious things why that is

346
00:22:08,929 --> 00:22:12,070
be a problem but don't overlook Apple
for security holes

347
00:22:12,070 --> 00:22:19,070
they're going to be coming up

348
00:22:20,770 --> 00:22:24,340
hi I'm out well Pines and for the
Socceroos

349
00:22:24,340 --> 00:22:28,540
nine mostly concentrate on keeping the
website content there

350
00:22:28,540 --> 00:22:31,770
ugly graphics that some people complain

351
00:22:31,770 --> 00:22:34,940
not a graphic artist

352
00:22:34,940 --> 00:22:40,510
and more poorly recently

353
00:22:40,510 --> 00:22:43,850
working closely with much of crack

354
00:22:43,850 --> 00:22:47,820
trying to put my expertise in writing

355
00:22:47,820 --> 00:22:52,210
interface code to make something that's
we talk about

356
00:22:52,210 --> 00:22:55,490
you know tools kiddies by unless you
make something

357
00:22:55,490 --> 00:22:58,910
that anyone can use that any reporter
can look at

358
00:22:58,910 --> 00:23:02,190
that any marketing person Microsoft Kin

359
00:23:02,190 --> 00:23:05,770
actually download and use themselves
then they were not gonna think these

360
00:23:05,770 --> 00:23:06,580
holes actually

361
00:23:06,580 --> 00:23:10,970
sister threat they just think it's an
obscure problem

362
00:23:10,970 --> 00:23:14,360
that maybe couple hackers my

363
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:18,190
exploit by if you make something easy to
use

364
00:23:18,190 --> 00:23:22,330
and I recommend this to anyone who has
an exploit script or

365
00:23:22,330 --> 00:23:28,220
has a as a something written down as an
exploit if you have the capability

366
00:23:28,220 --> 00:23:32,290
we don't find someone see right and
interface

367
00:23:32,290 --> 00:23:35,799
give it a good name and you'll get

368
00:23:35,799 --> 00:23:42,799
Press and and Microsoft hates that

369
00:23:45,820 --> 00:23:46,919
the the advisories

370
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:50,730
page his become something important
person actually

371
00:23:50,730 --> 00:23:56,420
people contacting us asking us whether
they can release things advisories

372
00:23:56,420 --> 00:24:01,120
page abortion and we would like you to
do that we've sent things out the search

373
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:01,520
things

374
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:05,430
Sun security through things the
microsofts security Microsoft

375
00:24:05,430 --> 00:24:09,010
mailing list and it's kind of a black
hole

376
00:24:09,010 --> 00:24:13,540
no one knows what you sent known in the
rest act community knows about these

377
00:24:13,540 --> 00:24:14,450
things status

378
00:24:14,450 --> 00:24:18,030
go away sometimes they pop up sometimes
they don't

379
00:24:18,030 --> 00:24:23,020
usually when they pop up you know
getting credit for it to put something

380
00:24:23,020 --> 00:24:23,700
on the

381
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:28,020
lot advisories page or should get
prominent credit for

382
00:24:28,020 --> 00:24:31,160
on the mailing list we don't need things
like Sir

383
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:38,160
to get the information out there so
that's that's really all I have to say

384
00:24:39,310 --> 00:24:46,310
the 10 man a whole lot where

385
00:24:51,470 --> 00:24:55,040
yes ready at this point

386
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:58,830
also like one out art

387
00:24:58,830 --> 00:25:02,210
are problems

388
00:25:02,210 --> 00:25:06,050
here checked it's been cast merchandise

389
00:25:06,050 --> 00:25:09,240
received average princes

390
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:14,890
problems wire here

391
00:25:14,890 --> 00:25:20,600
check can we kick the

392
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:26,470
PowerPoint slide on now

393
00:25:26,470 --> 00:25:28,650
well the guy that'd be able to see the
PowerPoint stuff

394
00:25:28,650 --> 00:25:33,630
as I don't know a song with exportable

395
00:25:33,630 --> 00:25:36,730
okay

396
00:25:36,730 --> 00:25:40,580
well I didn't know anything up before
gonna miss

397
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:44,620
a let me take this this opportunity to
got

398
00:25:44,620 --> 00:25:47,740
mention other products going on that is

399
00:25:47,740 --> 00:25:51,130
is really quite kick ass week we've got
the owner at

400
00:25:51,130 --> 00:25:54,630
sitting around someone the backend the
O's is probably that the

401
00:25:54,630 --> 00:25:59,230
prominent head up the OpenBSD project I
know how many people over to this how

402
00:25:59,230 --> 00:26:01,750
many people are familiar with it OpenBSD

403
00:26:01,750 --> 00:26:07,930
rock feels over here he's got a bunch of
the CD is broken BST OpenBSD

404
00:26:07,930 --> 00:26:12,070
is a BS did arrive I UNIX wet

405
00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:15,450
appeal how many security enhancements
right now over NetBSD

406
00:26:15,450 --> 00:26:21,120
the house and

407
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:25,040
good this this is an appeal calling us

408
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:29,040
let me silly for saying this but this is
largely an operating system written by

409
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:32,300
hackers by by serious hackers

410
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:36,560
and there is some good shit inside here
where you do.

411
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:41,710
like like like like are foregoing anyway

412
00:26:41,710 --> 00:26:46,080
on anybody who wants to contribute to
the cause of me ft should stop by Cpl

413
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:48,120
see anybody carrying around a large
stack

414
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:51,860
the said like the Los seal of approval
which which since this one does have our

415
00:26:51,860 --> 00:26:54,210
parking is kinda like signing bad code
you know

416
00:26:54,210 --> 00:27:00,670
funny malicious app lets I'll I'm just
getting up by somebody carrying it

417
00:27:00,670 --> 00:27:01,170
around

418
00:27:01,170 --> 00:27:04,710
pick it up if you're on Linux gonna love
this if you're running NetBSD and

419
00:27:04,710 --> 00:27:05,460
FreeBSD

420
00:27:05,460 --> 00:27:09,090
you're gonna love this you'll never go
back and

421
00:27:09,090 --> 00:27:12,490
now leads a what's kickin the law
practice this is a talk given at a

422
00:27:12,490 --> 00:27:13,400
couple places

423
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:18,200
gave us the Microsoft a little while ago
they were tremendously happy about it

424
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:21,490
but that's okay

425
00:27:21,490 --> 00:27:25,050
right this is going to be a little
awkward because I'm gonna Brianna

426
00:27:25,050 --> 00:27:32,050
backers me

427
00:27:35,790 --> 00:27:41,240
the yes all this is a little bizarre

428
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:45,900
II okay mom lot crack

429
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:51,660
use Microsoft passwords first up I can't
stand working with Microsoft

430
00:27:51,660 --> 00:27:55,070
gotten this label up like being an anti
hacker I don't like that

431
00:27:55,070 --> 00:27:59,370
I don't wanna be working on Microsoft
products right now the problem is there

432
00:27:59,370 --> 00:28:00,240
everywhere

433
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:04,410
you cannot get away from them I you know
once in a while to get job to like but

434
00:28:04,410 --> 00:28:06,370
some food on the table and everybody's
going

435
00:28:06,370 --> 00:28:10,210
while yes sure we've got a couple UNIX
box over there but those are those all

436
00:28:10,210 --> 00:28:13,790
gnarly UNIX guru sitting back there and
they don't talk to us and they smell

437
00:28:13,790 --> 00:28:17,840
made they don't sleep and they don't
shower and a look at our nice sales

438
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:20,420
marketing joys running this you dnt
installation

439
00:28:20,420 --> 00:28:24,690
they aren't they pretty and sweet
smelling last

440
00:28:24,690 --> 00:28:30,320
beautiful on so at some point we had to
start looking at Microsoft in a hobbit

441
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:32,360
who's sitting around here is also
welcome

442
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:35,950
knowledge in Microsoft and at the same
time is in the same boat as I am not

443
00:28:35,950 --> 00:28:36,870
wanting to be

444
00:28:36,870 --> 00:28:40,700
working on that we like packing UNIX
instead %ah

445
00:28:40,700 --> 00:28:44,670
runs into the same problem so we're
looking at how Microsoft

446
00:28:44,670 --> 00:28:48,830
was just doing the passwords Microsoft
has that the past what in the Sam

447
00:28:48,830 --> 00:28:49,790
registry

448
00:28:49,790 --> 00:28:53,210
and Jeremy Allison

449
00:28:53,210 --> 00:28:56,580
a along with the help of somebody else
in the final member names here the right

450
00:28:56,580 --> 00:28:59,320
away at the up to skating the password
hashes in there

451
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:03,790
now there to password hashes for each
user that the lamb and hash

452
00:29:03,790 --> 00:29:07,520
and AT&T which is drive mt4 one-way
function

453
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:12,510
next level is so after the obvious
cation the registry here's what you end

454
00:29:12,510 --> 00:29:13,110
up seeing

455
00:29:13,110 --> 00:29:16,500
so in the user who's got user name of
two under par aana

456
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:19,770
ends up not being a clever name we're
gonna see as password is 2 A's

457
00:29:19,770 --> 00:29:23,710
on you ID is stored in there you see
that the second bill this is almost like

458
00:29:23,710 --> 00:29:25,460
a unique set the password file or

459
00:29:25,460 --> 00:29:29,410
you know whichever next you're looking
at the first actions are being the lamb

460
00:29:29,410 --> 00:29:30,170
and hash

461
00:29:30,170 --> 00:29:33,460
in the second half ends up being the NT
Hashimi said them broken up down the

462
00:29:33,460 --> 00:29:34,650
bottom and on

463
00:29:34,650 --> 00:29:37,850
applying through this little bit but I
got I gotta like a 45-minute

464
00:29:37,850 --> 00:29:40,150
presentation in like 20 minutes here so

465
00:29:40,150 --> 00:29:43,770
arm well myself I'll I answer questions
afterwards

466
00:29:43,770 --> 00:29:48,970
at the next light okay the trickiest
lamb and as an older password scheme

467
00:29:48,970 --> 00:29:52,760
used up for the wonderful work for
clients for Windows 95

468
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:56,200
up 31 and of course and he has to
understand this

469
00:29:56,200 --> 00:30:01,170
but there are some interesting little
caveats to let you can do

470
00:30:01,170 --> 00:30:04,900
with the lamb and password france is the
password can be no more than 14

471
00:30:04,900 --> 00:30:07,190
characters in length that's not bad

472
00:30:07,190 --> 00:30:10,940
UNIX password can only be eight
characters in length so Microsoft got

473
00:30:10,940 --> 00:30:12,050
one up on your right there

474
00:30:12,050 --> 00:30:15,720
hyperlinked is greater than 14
characters its truncated at the link has

475
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:17,430
left it's bad out with Knowles

476
00:30:17,430 --> 00:30:22,780
up to the 14 character on okay

477
00:30:22,780 --> 00:30:27,629
arm the path was converted all uppercase
well they gonna lose on UNIX on that one

478
00:30:27,630 --> 00:30:32,530
com the 40 byte string ones is converted
to uppercase and the being split into

479
00:30:32,530 --> 00:30:33,470
two halves

480
00:30:33,470 --> 00:30:37,580
and you've got in all seven characters
in seven characters passwords less than

481
00:30:37,580 --> 00:30:40,820
seven characters are able to the right
hand side

482
00:30:40,820 --> 00:30:45,040
gonna be on alls they take this and they
derive an odd parity a fight

483
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:48,500
as the from 87 might have neck

484
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:54,140
next light now they've taken known
constant that they always use over and

485
00:30:54,140 --> 00:30:56,150
over and over again

486
00:30:56,150 --> 00:31:00,850
to encrypt each side at the two sides
are then concatenate in the form the

487
00:31:00,850 --> 00:31:03,600
lamb and hatch so you're 14 character
long password

488
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:06,820
has now been turned down to a seven
character long password

489
00:31:06,820 --> 00:31:10,970
on each side that only uppercase oh and
there's also

490
00:31:10,970 --> 00:31:15,660
no salt under this and assaulting a in
UNIX when you actually look at the first

491
00:31:15,660 --> 00:31:16,179
the

492
00:31:16,179 --> 00:31:19,429
a to be six bits up the UNIX password

493
00:31:19,429 --> 00:31:23,050
is basically a randomization so that you
have a password

494
00:31:23,050 --> 00:31:24,370
love and

495
00:31:24,370 --> 00:31:27,880
and something else about love annually
at the password file it doesn't end up

496
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:29,110
being the same string

497
00:31:29,110 --> 00:31:32,900
in there Microsoft doesn't understand
this notion

498
00:31:32,900 --> 00:31:35,910
if you've got a pass wanna love and
encrypts the whatever

499
00:31:35,910 --> 00:31:40,240
& Jon doe had the past love you can just
scream down visibly looking through all

500
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:42,880
those two people at the same password
that's kinda

501
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:48,140
hi next slide so we walked through what
actually happens here

502
00:31:48,140 --> 00:31:51,990
to lay it becomes too big A's you bad
out the 14 life

503
00:31:51,990 --> 00:31:55,550
reagan have string1 is a a poll by five
in all string

504
00:31:55,550 --> 00:31:58,980
do is seven dollars over here next slide
please

505
00:31:58,980 --> 00:32:03,309
standard as tough well like to start a
key is in the

506
00:32:03,309 --> 00:32:07,879
as they they lose in bits and they're
also on what is wrong

507
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:12,110
and then the standard as though they set
the schedule

508
00:32:12,110 --> 00:32:15,600
no problem next level to the next get
through some the technical crap ear

509
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:19,270
bankrupt against a known cause another
thing is you saw that it was a five

510
00:32:19,270 --> 00:32:19,800
miles

511
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:23,640
and then seven dollars on the other side
think rip bother those against the same

512
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:28,790
damn constant I let that sink in for a
couple seconds here

513
00:32:28,790 --> 00:32:31,950
this is stupid arm

514
00:32:31,950 --> 00:32:35,500
output doom the second string has this
wonderful

515
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:41,010
83 be 435 b5 1404 he idea but had to
cross my forehead

516
00:32:41,010 --> 00:32:48,010
walk down the halls Microsoft the

517
00:32:49,430 --> 00:32:52,830
when you see this this means that the
user's password is seven characters or

518
00:32:52,830 --> 00:32:53,270
less

519
00:32:53,270 --> 00:32:56,360
okay let's let's roll on to the next one
access to get there

520
00:32:56,360 --> 00:32:59,870
their secret constant that to their firm

521
00:32:59,870 --> 00:33:03,610
they can get it you can see the second
half which starts off a eighty three be

522
00:33:03,610 --> 00:33:05,190
43 but this is why you don't

523
00:33:05,190 --> 00:33:08,820
encrypt the city of both step both sides
with the same constant menace

524
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:10,080
concatenate them together

525
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:13,530
next slide alright

526
00:33:13,530 --> 00:33:16,660
why it's lame now

527
00:33:16,660 --> 00:33:21,040
only 14 characters long there's no saw

528
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:25,100
people the same password again ish
shoppers the same crib string if you

529
00:33:25,100 --> 00:33:25,470
will

530
00:33:25,470 --> 00:33:29,800
an A in reality it's not even the 14
characters long as you have to worry

531
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:30,400
about

532
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:34,980
it's the seven characters the next slide
please

533
00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:39,410
sup we said that they had two passwords
stored inside the register their the

534
00:33:39,410 --> 00:33:41,020
land Manhattan the NTS

535
00:33:41,020 --> 00:33:44,270
the NT password can be up to 128
characters in line

536
00:33:44,270 --> 00:33:48,570
a bit better I'm not gonna remember that
ass of myself but a

537
00:33:48,570 --> 00:33:51,990
whatever its case sensitive this is good

538
00:33:51,990 --> 00:33:55,400
on that would convert Unicode Unicode is

539
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:58,730
is this abomination a representational
up

540
00:33:58,730 --> 00:34:03,080
okay if I have a bite 0 recs 41 which
happens to be capital A

541
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:07,020
in Unicode as represent 0 x41 0x00

542
00:34:07,020 --> 00:34:10,360
club double the length of it but at
least I can have support for character

543
00:34:10,360 --> 00:34:11,669
set such as kanji

544
00:34:11,668 --> 00:34:15,690
I or other foreign characters that which
might need more than 256 bits to

545
00:34:15,690 --> 00:34:16,389
represent

546
00:34:16,389 --> 00:34:20,730
each individual letter so don't know

547
00:34:20,730 --> 00:34:25,240
and if that's good or bad right here
shouldn't be passwords then run through

548
00:34:25,240 --> 00:34:27,540
our say that before message digest
function

549
00:34:27,540 --> 00:34:30,719
and they take the resulting 16 byte
value that the NTS

550
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:34,020
what school so both of these guys are
using on

551
00:34:34,020 --> 00:34:37,750
strong ripped up lamb and and the A&T
four

552
00:34:37,750 --> 00:34:41,440
they've got a they've got Dez on the lam
and stuff

553
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:45,220
and they've got the message digest from
Marseille under the anti side of things

554
00:34:45,220 --> 00:34:48,419
not that this is just a brief run
through what happens

555
00:34:48,418 --> 00:34:53,879
per user to a for the anti side of
things that's pretty straightforward

556
00:34:53,879 --> 00:34:54,549
next lively

557
00:34:54,550 --> 00:34:57,730
so what do we do with this well

558
00:34:57,730 --> 00:35:01,470
we took a look at it and said she's that
this is really kinda lame and

559
00:35:01,470 --> 00:35:04,880
once the application was done we could
easily come up with a password cracker

560
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:09,420
for it I just wanna standard dictionary
on it and some people said well yeah

561
00:35:09,420 --> 00:35:12,520
yeah that's great mike is a little cool
and you know

562
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:15,140
everybody said you know go back to sit
in your little room without the air

563
00:35:15,140 --> 00:35:17,370
conditioning and think hurry on your
machine some more

564
00:35:17,370 --> 00:35:20,790
on so I went over well I said well

565
00:35:20,790 --> 00:35:24,330
look this is really bad we've got a
couple things in here that says

566
00:35:24,330 --> 00:35:27,810
million on not among the water gonna
show you how the lamb and ash

567
00:35:27,810 --> 00:35:32,470
gets lamer and lamer and lamer and lamer
here but nobody's listening to me

568
00:35:32,470 --> 00:35:35,760
well i sat down and bought for a little
bit now

569
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:40,630
well said you going to do I'm gonna read
it going for it

570
00:35:40,630 --> 00:35:47,630
and we said yes

571
00:35:49,540 --> 00:35:54,150
good the thing is everybody is going on
don't think you we are to attack ok then

572
00:35:54,150 --> 00:35:56,040
all the quote-unquote script kiddies can
run it

573
00:35:56,040 --> 00:35:59,540
well guess what unless you make a point
and click to all the administrators

574
00:35:59,540 --> 00:36:00,819
don't know how to run it either

575
00:36:00,819 --> 00:36:07,210
sup

576
00:36:07,210 --> 00:36:11,260
we r we released this Microsoft a little
bit upset but they are they were more

577
00:36:11,260 --> 00:36:14,010
worried about some other things we
prophesies in the next version

578
00:36:14,010 --> 00:36:17,180
that we are coming out with and inside
here a

579
00:36:17,180 --> 00:36:20,250
this was on remember which this was
version 1.0

580
00:36:20,250 --> 00:36:23,300
that we came out with and the brute
force attack one

581
00:36:23,300 --> 00:36:26,490
other the check box was there didn't
necessarily work in the ago iverson

582
00:36:26,490 --> 00:36:29,660
which we ship the command line version
which it didn't work did work with also

583
00:36:29,660 --> 00:36:33,250
so if the next slide thank ya

584
00:36:33,250 --> 00:36:38,530
Sears what we didn't version 1.0 course
in other media love dick has all the

585
00:36:38,530 --> 00:36:45,130
the newspaper people like who pretty
pictures crib to compare dictionary

586
00:36:45,130 --> 00:36:46,589
attacks against the lamb and hash

587
00:36:46,589 --> 00:36:50,319
great that the compared to protect get
the NT hash that's fine

588
00:36:50,319 --> 00:36:53,520
well we decided to just doing the same
password twice

589
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:57,299
just the crib in different ways in the
end he has as much are the laminations

590
00:36:57,299 --> 00:36:58,589
much easier to actually break

591
00:36:58,589 --> 00:37:01,390
you reduced to the lowest common
denominator for the amount of security

592
00:37:01,390 --> 00:37:03,420
that you hold with this interrupted
password

593
00:37:03,420 --> 00:37:07,900
so why don't we go after the lawn man
has and then derive the NT hash

594
00:37:07,900 --> 00:37:12,980
of a bit doesn't you have up elsewhere
that ends up being seven days long

595
00:37:12,980 --> 00:37:16,160
alternating uppercase lowercase
uppercase lowercase

596
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:20,368
the land Manhasset going automatically
be converted to all uppercase

597
00:37:20,369 --> 00:37:23,940
so we brute force through end up getting
the s7 uppercase

598
00:37:23,940 --> 00:37:27,069
I'll let a raise we then say okay this
is 78

599
00:37:27,069 --> 00:37:31,000
we don't know the case sensitivity other
we will infected with mt4

600
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:34,640
are not happy with them before and

601
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:37,759
take a look at the matches but doesn't
match all we have to go through as to

602
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:41,130
the seventh a number possible
combinations to get the case sensitivity

603
00:37:41,130 --> 00:37:41,670
out a bit

604
00:37:41,670 --> 00:37:46,210
fil A matches so you break down to
whatever's the easiest thing to go after

605
00:37:46,210 --> 00:37:50,000
and the more complex things that are
based upon a star to fall very quickly

606
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:53,520
to the thing that really this Microsoft
aw

607
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:56,790
was they're like well hey you can
dictionary attack units

608
00:37:56,790 --> 00:38:00,220
you can I help well you can you can
dictionary attack anything

609
00:38:00,220 --> 00:38:03,640
and we said yeah but you're probably the
only operating system that we've been

610
00:38:03,640 --> 00:38:04,520
able to see

611
00:38:04,520 --> 00:38:08,930
a an animal many a tool that lets you
brute force through the entire key space

612
00:38:08,930 --> 00:38:13,129
a ball a password and what this means is
let's say you have a really

613
00:38:13,130 --> 00:38:17,180
really really good ass where that's not
gonna show up in a dictionary attack

614
00:38:17,180 --> 00:38:23,259
doesn't matter it still gets it all the
way up to 14 characters long and lanky

615
00:38:23,260 --> 00:38:26,760
sensible that's cool I could do the arm
I could do the NT password that can be

616
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:28,520
up to 128 characters long line

617
00:38:28,520 --> 00:38:32,500
well has anybody ever use the User
Manager tool inside NT

618
00:38:32,500 --> 00:38:36,599
you know what happens when you start
typing in past the 14th character

619
00:38:36,599 --> 00:38:40,180
starts beeping at you it is now

620
00:38:40,180 --> 00:38:44,848
40 is good enough for you joe next like
this

621
00:38:44,849 --> 00:38:48,500
so you're so we basically much the
dictionary

622
00:38:48,500 --> 00:38:52,440
standard stuff crippling affair it's
like bill talk to people or

623
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:55,950
some of my other son for everybody in
here is one crack at one time or another

624
00:38:55,950 --> 00:38:59,890
this is what it does we can instantly
look through and throw a pass was longer

625
00:38:59,890 --> 00:39:02,680
than seven characters with see the user
password is less than

626
00:39:02,680 --> 00:39:05,930
om so we save some time running to the
dictionary attack

627
00:39:05,930 --> 00:39:09,759
we only have 21 run-through one round of
Dez you Nexus

628
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:13,270
done only 24 rounds so we've spent up
there and

629
00:39:13,270 --> 00:39:16,579
we don't have to deal with any other
salts on UNIX you have to run through to

630
00:39:16,579 --> 00:39:18,329
anybody six possible combinations

631
00:39:18,329 --> 00:39:23,770
and that's when you run for one and no
we don't want to get one says there's no

632
00:39:23,770 --> 00:39:24,329
salt

633
00:39:24,329 --> 00:39:27,700
we just scream down the rest to the user
list so if you use a list

634
00:39:27,700 --> 00:39:32,339
thousand people and %ah fifty of them
have the password uva

635
00:39:32,339 --> 00:39:37,569
welcome and I'm Creek welcome once I
just simply scroll down the list and see

636
00:39:37,569 --> 00:39:39,430
who fucking matched up with the a

637
00:39:39,430 --> 00:39:43,000
with the take up a string that the hash
just popping in welcome welcome welcome

638
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:43,940
welcome welcome

639
00:39:43,940 --> 00:39:48,130
no more trips no more compare well just
just compare to that point on

640
00:39:48,130 --> 00:39:52,520
woo 121 installation and a and and saw
seven hundred user show up with the

641
00:39:52,520 --> 00:39:54,799
password change me without that was kind
of humorous

642
00:39:54,799 --> 00:39:59,599
this is called a large-scale
anti-inflation

643
00:39:59,599 --> 00:40:02,809
next slide please

644
00:40:02,809 --> 00:40:06,520
on anti 94 what we do here is weak we
basically

645
00:40:06,520 --> 00:40:10,339
look for the lamb and hash then we're on
a good thing compare up

646
00:40:10,339 --> 00:40:12,990
due to the sterling whatever the
dictionary word is to get the case

647
00:40:12,990 --> 00:40:13,869
sensitivity

648
00:40:13,869 --> 00:40:17,849
once we have that we can go back to both
the new why is it important

649
00:40:17,849 --> 00:40:20,910
well if you don't know the case
sensitivity you walk up to the actual

650
00:40:20,910 --> 00:40:23,118
console any other administrators
password is

651
00:40:23,119 --> 00:40:25,390
seven days but you don't know what's
alternating uppercase lowercase

652
00:40:25,390 --> 00:40:26,569
uppercase lowercase

653
00:40:26,569 --> 00:40:30,480
you can sit there and type it in on log
n you need another case sensitivity when

654
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:33,710
using in from the Consul

655
00:40:33,710 --> 00:40:40,710
com next time please

656
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:45,590
dictionary yet area experts okay

657
00:40:45,590 --> 00:40:49,530
this is an interesting strongest best
would like to nancy is seven characters

658
00:40:49,530 --> 00:40:53,810
you have a 10 character long password is
just as easy to break is a seven

659
00:40:53,810 --> 00:40:55,040
characters long password

660
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:58,290
yeah but 13 12 11

661
00:40:58,290 --> 00:41:03,609
whatever the trickiest and obviously
anything below seven characters takes

662
00:41:03,609 --> 00:41:05,390
less time to crack and seven characters

663
00:41:05,390 --> 00:41:09,339
since it breaks it into the 27 part
helps the seven bite

664
00:41:09,340 --> 00:41:12,359
and bankrupting at against the same
string

665
00:41:12,359 --> 00:41:15,869
if you wanna brute force all the way up
through it and let it the next like to

666
00:41:15,869 --> 00:41:17,310
think we start talking about this

667
00:41:17,310 --> 00:41:20,450
yep usare

668
00:41:20,450 --> 00:41:24,270
just as a passive a user site seven at
the best would've

669
00:41:24,270 --> 00:41:28,150
as you see 10a has a special exhibit 710

670
00:41:28,150 --> 00:41:32,880
there's the two hashes you'll see this
wonderful of second half their age 83

671
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:35,230
people or 35 yada yada

672
00:41:35,230 --> 00:41:38,680
and 7 a-1 and we know instantly that

673
00:41:38,680 --> 00:41:43,430
we don't have to ever compare the right
hand side the sash bottom a 10-day

674
00:41:43,430 --> 00:41:48,009
doesn't have this problem slut so do we
do

675
00:41:48,010 --> 00:41:51,230
well would take a little visual
inspection on they say sure

676
00:41:51,230 --> 00:41:54,700
the use our 7-day is only seven
characters long

677
00:41:54,700 --> 00:41:58,030
user 10 is gonna be more so as a running
through

678
00:41:58,030 --> 00:42:02,330
words zooming a key space of just A's we
never have to check

679
00:42:02,330 --> 00:42:05,710
the right hand side abuser ten-day until
we get up

680
00:42:05,710 --> 00:42:09,070
a I'm sorry we never have to check the
left hand side is a 10-day

681
00:42:09,070 --> 00:42:13,500
on any passwords less than seven
characters in like

682
00:42:13,500 --> 00:42:17,150
and we only check the left hand side

683
00:42:17,150 --> 00:42:21,940
use our 7-day next like I think I've got
this in here

684
00:42:21,940 --> 00:42:28,330
okay IEEE

685
00:42:28,330 --> 00:42:31,340
look at when we get to the third AAA

686
00:42:31,340 --> 00:42:35,980
ever on checking the right hand side up
these are 10 a password we notice that

687
00:42:35,980 --> 00:42:36,920
it's 3 A's

688
00:42:36,920 --> 00:42:40,740
has seven plus three is 10 wells on our
way up to

689
00:42:40,740 --> 00:42:44,690
27 anyway is gonna start at zero and
move up to seven by the time you get

690
00:42:44,690 --> 00:42:46,610
seven you've got 14 total

691
00:42:46,610 --> 00:42:51,460
comparing both sides near so we lock in
on the second half of that second user

692
00:42:51,460 --> 00:42:55,370
that all we know the second hardest AAA
now those of you who are really

693
00:42:55,370 --> 00:42:58,540
up motivated could take a dictionary
attack

694
00:42:58,540 --> 00:43:01,540
and say people at large in seven 7
character words

695
00:43:01,540 --> 00:43:04,770
well let's look into the right hand side
a bit

696
00:43:04,770 --> 00:43:08,009
if we let CNN's in the last two words
are Mb

697
00:43:08,010 --> 00:43:11,460
let's only stream through a dictionary
that we have sitting elsewhere

698
00:43:11,460 --> 00:43:14,650
and look for look at work the only and
in any way instantly

699
00:43:14,650 --> 00:43:17,990
locked out a tremendous amount of
possibilities that we have to check

700
00:43:17,990 --> 00:43:22,810
this would also work with britain
getting hashes looks like please

701
00:43:22,810 --> 00:43:27,360
once you get the %uh lamb and ash

702
00:43:27,360 --> 00:43:30,410
basically just drive dnt hash from it a

703
00:43:30,410 --> 00:43:34,049
yet again Microsoft kept saying well

704
00:43:34,050 --> 00:43:38,000
we we are going to take responsibility
for how lame lawn man is because thats

705
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,550
protocol that IBM came up with many
years ago

706
00:43:40,550 --> 00:43:44,630
we have to use it we have it in their
whatever you know Jesus

707
00:43:44,630 --> 00:43:49,520
will win so they have a

708
00:43:49,520 --> 00:43:52,000
so is that what you know if you're
worried about security use the NT

709
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:52,690
dialect

710
00:43:52,690 --> 00:43:56,230
nineties I look strong sitting there
with the

711
00:43:56,230 --> 00:43:59,650
land Manhattan next to it and the other
thing is that

712
00:43:59,650 --> 00:44:02,670
you really need to be able to use a lamb
and ask because how many if you work in

713
00:44:02,670 --> 00:44:03,530
a place that has been

714
00:44:03,530 --> 00:44:07,650
what me raise a hand how many people
worker I've been to a place that has

715
00:44:07,650 --> 00:44:10,080
Microsoft anti installed in like a
commercial

716
00:44:10,080 --> 00:44:13,920
environment probably most to you

717
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:17,330
how many have you have been to that have
seen a place

718
00:44:17,330 --> 00:44:23,130
that has only anti install no 95 no
windows for workgroups clients

719
00:44:23,130 --> 00:44:26,330
you've been a pleasure

720
00:44:26,330 --> 00:44:30,380
nothing but empty no 95 no UNIX

721
00:44:30,380 --> 00:44:34,720
running south summer reading that UNIX
their your hands qualified

722
00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:38,380
they could be all okay else one out oh

723
00:44:38,380 --> 00:44:43,990
the army of hands that one up just a
second ago the cake ever this backwards

724
00:44:43,990 --> 00:44:45,030
compatibility

725
00:44:45,030 --> 00:44:49,050
buddy on the ass for as long as there
around but next slide please

726
00:44:49,050 --> 00:44:53,480
so what would you use lost track for

727
00:44:53,480 --> 00:44:57,600
all that well talk about this in a in
Cup success when applied through here

728
00:44:57,600 --> 00:45:01,880
animal fielding questions administrators
could use a broadening their systems

729
00:45:01,880 --> 00:45:05,400
currently the way to check abuser has a
good pass were not on and the Sox

730
00:45:05,400 --> 00:45:08,740
yet the turn of the security that you
have said you can keep trying to log in

731
00:45:08,740 --> 00:45:09,550
at that user

732
00:45:09,550 --> 00:45:13,410
if you have a lockout user after 45
tries and you run this you gonna lock

733
00:45:13,410 --> 00:45:16,080
all user accounts never know whether
they had a good astronaut

734
00:45:16,080 --> 00:45:19,500
I think crack is a wonderful tool for
both the bad guys and the bad guys bad

735
00:45:19,500 --> 00:45:21,010
guys again being the corporation's

736
00:45:21,010 --> 00:45:24,290
on so

737
00:45:24,290 --> 00:45:27,200
with with that all this this is a useful
tool and it's easy enough to use the

738
00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:28,690
administrators can figure it out to

739
00:45:28,690 --> 00:45:32,980
on its it's also important to realize
that Microsoft

740
00:45:32,980 --> 00:45:36,630
a is is I guess how that point the
wonderful firm up

741
00:45:36,630 --> 00:45:40,300
the Microsoft order marketing juggernaut

742
00:45:40,300 --> 00:45:44,520
there they're just this huge the the
Borgata star trek to this you trace it

743
00:45:44,520 --> 00:45:45,340
just goes along

744
00:45:45,340 --> 00:45:49,020
as long enough bothering them that is
kinda like consume everybody implement

745
00:45:49,020 --> 00:45:51,070
as they need to as soon as you get in
the way they tryin

746
00:45:51,070 --> 00:45:54,980
likely of ap

747
00:45:54,980 --> 00:46:01,980
all and of course attackers could use
this

748
00:46:02,840 --> 00:46:07,050
a course with 1.0 on you really had to
be the administrator in order to adopt

749
00:46:07,050 --> 00:46:08,000
the user passwords

750
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,700
if your administrator on a primary
domain controller though you had

751
00:46:10,700 --> 00:46:13,220
everybody's passwords and you're
guaranteed to be able to get back

752
00:46:13,220 --> 00:46:17,920
all of them so I'm not gonna like Jesus
mike is looking out the message saying

753
00:46:17,920 --> 00:46:20,960
don't use different passwords that are
easily guess we like dogging

754
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:24,430
hack well now we can say don't use
password like a 75

755
00:46:24,430 --> 00:46:27,799
3216 up an ampersand

756
00:46:27,800 --> 00:46:34,800
and flow

757
00:46:38,369 --> 00:46:40,160
exactly Microsoft response

758
00:46:40,160 --> 00:46:43,770
even after we said that they said
soldiers gathered up

759
00:46:43,770 --> 00:46:46,930
they also came out this thing called
assist keep ash

760
00:46:46,930 --> 00:46:50,700
and what that did is it prevented the
administrator from

761
00:46:50,700 --> 00:46:57,700
dumping out the registry to run the tool
stop hackers they said Haji Islam

762
00:46:59,930 --> 00:47:03,250
if you stick your head in the sand the
problem goes away

763
00:47:03,250 --> 00:47:07,349
so all ended up doing is on

764
00:47:07,349 --> 00:47:11,170
I love using the phrase emasculating in
front of Microsoft employees

765
00:47:11,170 --> 00:47:15,319
they never addressed the fact that their
captain was seriously you know like a

766
00:47:15,319 --> 00:47:16,420
big girl fall

767
00:47:16,420 --> 00:47:21,329
so of course we had a response to
Microsoft response that we both feel

768
00:47:21,329 --> 00:47:23,549
slighted by this %ah response was

769
00:47:23,549 --> 00:47:27,660
years of crackers in 1.5

770
00:47:27,660 --> 00:47:34,660
the

771
00:47:36,769 --> 00:47:39,660
on not only does does the brute forcing
work in the

772
00:47:39,660 --> 00:47:43,180
the going a whole bunch of holes are
fixed up well put in a really call it a

773
00:47:43,180 --> 00:47:43,788
lot

774
00:47:43,789 --> 00:47:47,170
pack which was a %ah let him go into
like all the functionality of the golden

775
00:47:47,170 --> 00:47:47,619
star

776
00:47:47,619 --> 00:47:52,359
are this is amazing he kept getting my
butt to get things in here you'll see is

777
00:47:52,359 --> 00:47:56,750
lying on this um it does everything a
1.0 does

778
00:47:56,750 --> 00:48:01,349
some bug fixes some serious speed
improvements a and we said well geez you

779
00:48:01,349 --> 00:48:01,690
know

780
00:48:01,690 --> 00:48:04,750
they were bitching and moaning that you
know you had to be administrator in

781
00:48:04,750 --> 00:48:07,940
so wasn't an issue and then they even
released yet the

782
00:48:07,940 --> 00:48:11,079
this is key back saying that even if you
are administrators now screw you it's

783
00:48:11,079 --> 00:48:11,410
now

784
00:48:11,410 --> 00:48:15,058
Dublin on an issue anybody ever heard of
a sniffer

785
00:48:15,059 --> 00:48:20,000
yeah you can you count what little
password the line

786
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:23,240
because it's like it's like an old
party-line phone system you just you

787
00:48:23,240 --> 00:48:23,559
know

788
00:48:23,559 --> 00:48:26,779
are being nice and hanging up the phone
when the calls not for you

789
00:48:26,779 --> 00:48:30,539
well guess what Microsoft has this
challenge response mechanism

790
00:48:30,539 --> 00:48:33,910
that goes over the network that sends
these passwords but they knew

791
00:48:33,910 --> 00:48:37,750
they knew their crypto was a joke so
they said we're going

792
00:48:37,750 --> 00:48:41,289
to kinda turn these into a one-way
password one way

793
00:48:41,289 --> 00:48:46,220
a one-way hash or want us I want I'm
hash so that if you catch it

794
00:48:46,220 --> 00:48:49,359
and try and play it back really give you
a different challenge is not gonna let

795
00:48:49,359 --> 00:48:49,869
you in

796
00:48:49,869 --> 00:48:53,819
well we decided that

797
00:48:53,819 --> 00:48:59,810
we needed a break that also so we did

798
00:48:59,810 --> 00:49:00,600
the next slide

799
00:49:00,600 --> 00:49:04,790
here's how the challenge response works
now remember

800
00:49:04,790 --> 00:49:08,490
keep keep all this in mind and see when
the stars the sound familiar microsoft

801
00:49:08,490 --> 00:49:09,050
said

802
00:49:09,050 --> 00:49:12,130
don't blame us for the lamb and hassles
IBM's

803
00:49:12,130 --> 00:49:17,230
ball a use the Microsoft anti hasher
whatever which is just somebody else's

804
00:49:17,230 --> 00:49:18,570
stuff that we used anyway

805
00:49:18,570 --> 00:49:24,070
on now now look at what they do on the
network side of things on their own

806
00:49:24,070 --> 00:49:29,340
cleric was a log on challenge service
and back in a bike challenge

807
00:49:29,340 --> 00:49:33,020
so the plan says hi I'd like to start
talking you open up a session

808
00:49:33,020 --> 00:49:36,250
services here here's I here's here's

809
00:49:36,250 --> 00:49:40,570
a fight with a bomb a random right

810
00:49:40,570 --> 00:49:45,430
up Siam lapping random Microsoft's idea
random -ism

811
00:49:45,430 --> 00:49:50,460
about twenty years behind the time so
the client takes it doesn't affect the

812
00:49:50,460 --> 00:49:52,680
lamb and hand and he'd I like ashes

813
00:49:52,680 --> 00:49:56,540
with that if my challenge and sent them
back to the server server data

814
00:49:56,540 --> 00:50:00,100
does exact inverse to see if the hashes
are the real user's password so you

815
00:50:00,100 --> 00:50:07,100
don't have the actual hashes going
across the network it's likely okay

816
00:50:07,300 --> 00:50:10,510
first thing they do is they take that
sixty might hash

817
00:50:10,510 --> 00:50:14,650
little MTS was 16 bytes and so is the
lamb and one they padded up to 21

818
00:50:14,650 --> 00:50:18,410
guess what 21 advisable are divisible by
3

819
00:50:18,410 --> 00:50:21,640
you get seven %uh groupings

820
00:50:21,640 --> 00:50:26,569
33 groupings at seven characters G-seven
seems like %uh popular number over there

821
00:50:26,570 --> 00:50:30,280
it a key to the seven by values and
arrive 3

822
00:50:30,280 --> 00:50:35,560
by Todd their Tedeschi's now a Microsoft
had the chance to do it

823
00:50:35,560 --> 00:50:38,980
themselves and prove that they knew that
land man with a lame way of sending

824
00:50:38,980 --> 00:50:39,800
across the different

825
00:50:39,800 --> 00:50:43,420
matches including the anti-one they did
it based upon the land and model

826
00:50:43,420 --> 00:50:49,890
looks like this at sea

827
00:50:49,890 --> 00:50:53,490
encrypts the same ape-like challenge
which each one other the arm

828
00:50:53,490 --> 00:50:57,240
that is scheduled to arrive there this
is the same as taking a seat for

829
00:50:57,240 --> 00:50:58,610
constant worrying fretting

830
00:50:58,610 --> 00:51:02,330
the first-ever second at this time
taking this one same value in having the

831
00:51:02,330 --> 00:51:03,710
first episode nap in the third

832
00:51:03,710 --> 00:51:10,710
their G that I like a Microsoft around
this response has been sent back to the

833
00:51:11,330 --> 00:51:11,970
server

834
00:51:11,970 --> 00:51:15,510
same things done for the mt4 hash next
level is

835
00:51:15,510 --> 00:51:19,320
as just an example will spin through

836
00:51:19,320 --> 00:51:25,950
now yeah

837
00:51:25,950 --> 00:51:30,340
okay and there we go so 0.52 the same
dictionary hash

838
00:51:30,340 --> 00:51:35,090
our dictionary attack on this network
stuff

839
00:51:35,090 --> 00:51:38,690
all wind up doing is bad enough anyone
bites taking the challenge response and

840
00:51:38,690 --> 00:51:39,580
encrypting at their

841
00:51:39,580 --> 00:51:43,690
next slide please now here's the problem

842
00:51:43,690 --> 00:51:48,410
you can brute force this also saw it to
do is sit on the god damn network

843
00:51:48,410 --> 00:51:51,830
watching go back and forth with the SIS
keypad and the only person who can check

844
00:51:51,830 --> 00:51:53,440
the password is the administrator

845
00:51:53,440 --> 00:52:00,440
we do is to take a left to buy to the
alarm hash

846
00:52:00,650 --> 00:52:03,740
I and that ends up being 0400

847
00:52:03,740 --> 00:52:07,230
as your 0 the 04 he

848
00:52:07,230 --> 00:52:11,320
a pen 5 know also that and we can
quickly see if the password was seven

849
00:52:11,320 --> 00:52:12,390
characters or less

850
00:52:12,390 --> 00:52:19,009
now now now eventually drop things down
we we encrypt

851
00:52:19,010 --> 00:52:23,369
that against the eight my challenge if
it matches ellsberg a chance to seven

852
00:52:23,369 --> 00:52:24,190
characters less

853
00:52:24,190 --> 00:52:27,900
we can very easily run through on the
permutations to

854
00:52:27,900 --> 00:52:31,540
to guarantee that was or was not up next
light

855
00:52:31,540 --> 00:52:35,290
custom this is a look at this

856
00:52:35,290 --> 00:52:42,290
I hate looking at Microsoft stuff yeah
we have to run through

857
00:52:42,400 --> 00:52:46,680
bomb services tries to figure out a box
under a character's

858
00:52:46,680 --> 00:52:49,790
spin on so in love well

859
00:52:49,790 --> 00:52:54,609
going up doing up

860
00:52:54,609 --> 00:52:58,549
one other things we make sure we did is
we gave out source code to this with

861
00:52:58,550 --> 00:52:58,930
that

862
00:52:58,930 --> 00:53:03,359
if if someone isn't making any sense we
always try and make sure that you have

863
00:53:03,359 --> 00:53:04,259
the source code

864
00:53:04,260 --> 00:53:07,580
if you think it needs to go faster
there's plenty of room for optimizations

865
00:53:07,580 --> 00:53:08,250
if you think

866
00:53:08,250 --> 00:53:12,480
it needs to have extra functionality and
you have the source code

867
00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:16,359
go ahead hackett the hell up that's what
is therefore see how it works see how

868
00:53:16,359 --> 00:53:19,130
Microsoft is doing some other shit the
shutting down your throats

869
00:53:19,130 --> 00:53:22,359
on I one thing I asked though if yet

870
00:53:22,359 --> 00:53:26,190
at cool things into its an expected this
we love the poem back into the next

871
00:53:26,190 --> 00:53:28,240
versions and everything no problem
getting credit

872
00:53:28,240 --> 00:53:31,770
on it just goes out this is free this is
for people to use

873
00:53:31,770 --> 00:53:36,270
are I'm not just basically skip on how
does the challenge response right now to

874
00:53:36,270 --> 00:53:36,910
know our

875
00:53:36,910 --> 00:53:41,660
I know we're pushing time was gonna sit
around here oh yeah

876
00:53:41,660 --> 00:53:45,779
the other thing was up they said what
issues led the NT hassen

877
00:53:45,780 --> 00:53:48,780
in their service pack 3 they said all

878
00:53:48,780 --> 00:53:52,480
just just use the NTA just the medicaid
on the NT they still said the lamb and

879
00:53:52,480 --> 00:53:56,240
has across the network anyway which made
up through forcible

880
00:53:56,240 --> 00:54:02,270
next so we're still threatening
Microsoft with the version 2.0

881
00:54:02,270 --> 00:54:06,250
Bob the PTC PTC back up in a

882
00:54:06,250 --> 00:54:11,550
and sinking looks really atrocious up
you can basically up on the network and

883
00:54:11,550 --> 00:54:12,030
say

884
00:54:12,030 --> 00:54:16,040
I'm the PDC now they all believe you

885
00:54:16,040 --> 00:54:21,990
it's no problem

886
00:54:21,990 --> 00:54:26,020
I am we've got the snapper up I don't
think we've actually put it up on the

887
00:54:26,020 --> 00:54:26,930
website yet

888
00:54:26,930 --> 00:54:30,470
just because I'm so but around with that
want to develop the windows and the ones

889
00:54:30,470 --> 00:54:33,190
that people who don't necessarily have
units can have their running also

890
00:54:33,190 --> 00:54:37,580
and a conference Microsoft promised me
and from other witnesses that they would

891
00:54:37,580 --> 00:54:38,650
give the law

892
00:54:38,650 --> 00:54:42,830
a copy of the DTK the device developers
device drivers get

893
00:54:42,830 --> 00:54:46,500
whatever the hell the acronym stands for
to show how they do it up

894
00:54:46,500 --> 00:54:49,620
the packet filters yeah like we've seen
that from them

895
00:54:49,620 --> 00:54:53,450
and we're gonna punch a passive mode
components

896
00:54:53,450 --> 00:54:57,250
a which attacked the network by
listening how China Microsoft machines

897
00:54:57,250 --> 00:54:57,610
are

898
00:54:57,610 --> 00:55:01,070
example if this is how Microsoft
machines basically come on the net tell

899
00:55:01,070 --> 00:55:01,870
you who you are

900
00:55:01,870 --> 00:55:05,330
a if Microsoft machine comes on I'll say
pay

901
00:55:05,330 --> 00:55:08,670
on I machine number I machine bar

902
00:55:08,670 --> 00:55:12,360
a critical that somebody else has that
doesn't know all I'm bar

903
00:55:12,360 --> 00:55:15,980
okok arm I'm bar to

904
00:55:15,980 --> 00:55:19,200
anybody anybody alright that's me that's
what

905
00:55:19,200 --> 00:55:24,010
I am mistreated this is how they do all
that whoever shouts the loudest on the

906
00:55:24,010 --> 00:55:24,580
network

907
00:55:24,580 --> 00:55:27,920
if you're if you're a big unit cell so
whatever

908
00:55:27,920 --> 00:55:30,570
any but is never online and

909
00:55:30,570 --> 00:55:33,270
and two days later you throw ante on
there you will be amazed at how much

910
00:55:33,270 --> 00:55:35,160
crap is bouncing back and forth

911
00:55:35,160 --> 00:55:38,319
and we're gonna have enough components
in there that we should be able to

912
00:55:38,320 --> 00:55:39,280
release the law

913
00:55:39,280 --> 00:55:46,280
this service pack the

914
00:55:49,109 --> 00:55:52,759
has one other thing that somebody came
up to me the recently and they said

915
00:55:52,760 --> 00:55:55,900
yeah we've got NTR no I don't love it

916
00:55:55,900 --> 00:55:59,240
normal not if you broke into it why
would you want to work

917
00:55:59,240 --> 00:56:02,829
what can you do on it so them I said

918
00:56:02,829 --> 00:56:06,829
if that's the case why are you using it

919
00:56:06,829 --> 00:56:11,510
they said was not looking at the shell
prompt

920
00:56:11,510 --> 00:56:15,040
such on the town at a man that we wrote

921
00:56:15,040 --> 00:56:18,390
that we end up like following on the
boxes and

922
00:56:18,390 --> 00:56:21,910
handbag a nice little C column back
slashing on ms-dos yada yada yada now

923
00:56:21,910 --> 00:56:23,828
you're sitting locally on the machine
over the network

924
00:56:23,829 --> 00:56:27,380
they didn't like that

925
00:56:27,380 --> 00:56:31,420
next what I think that's it great so
before for go on I one hand this over

926
00:56:31,420 --> 00:56:31,970
because

927
00:56:31,970 --> 00:56:35,730
I've gone around giving us the talks
about help Microsoft likely doesn't stop

928
00:56:35,730 --> 00:56:40,069
underneath I did not have the gooey
coding up because that is really are

929
00:56:40,069 --> 00:56:43,519
doing with here who who dis walks over
and punched me on the back

930
00:56:43,519 --> 00:56:46,730
and once in a while going this is how
Microsoft really works

931
00:56:46,730 --> 00:56:53,730
ahead of the world on for any comments
and everything the

932
00:57:03,990 --> 00:57:06,720
have a couple things to say is a much
covered most

933
00:57:06,720 --> 00:57:11,920
but I knew lot of crack was becoming a
popular tool when the sysadmin is a

934
00:57:11,920 --> 00:57:12,359
company

935
00:57:12,359 --> 00:57:15,740
working for knows nothing about me being
the author came to me and said

936
00:57:15,740 --> 00:57:20,369
you know I'm running lot crack on our on
our a pass for database and everyone's

937
00:57:20,369 --> 00:57:22,430
got the same password as our company
name

938
00:57:22,430 --> 00:57:29,430
I know there are a lot of people out
there using it one thing much did

939
00:57:30,779 --> 00:57:31,809
mention was the

940
00:57:31,809 --> 00:57:36,720
the response that Microsoft had for our
life back 1.5 release which

941
00:57:36,720 --> 00:57:40,670
a great time because it came out exactly
one day after he gave his

942
00:57:40,670 --> 00:57:46,329
black talk I basically releasing 1.5 in
talking about one's capabilities

943
00:57:46,329 --> 00:57:49,420
work and there's their their hot pics

944
00:57:49,420 --> 00:57:53,099
which is how you can be in there Service
Pack

945
00:57:53,099 --> 00:57:58,460
for on was they have hot picks out which
is

946
00:57:58,460 --> 00:58:02,210
I to turn women authentication for

947
00:58:02,210 --> 00:58:06,119
over the network for anti workstations
and servers

948
00:58:06,119 --> 00:58:09,569
basically does absolutely nothing for
Windows 95 users

949
00:58:09,569 --> 00:58:13,880
working on backwards compatibility so
they really have a fix the problem they

950
00:58:13,880 --> 00:58:15,420
pretend they fix the problem

951
00:58:15,420 --> 00:58:18,930
we there was a article network world

952
00:58:18,930 --> 00:58:22,940
last week which much as quoted in

953
00:58:22,940 --> 00:58:28,980
and business like the article was
Microsoft you didn't fix the problem so

954
00:58:28,980 --> 00:58:32,680
member those people the people who
raised her hand saying that we have both

955
00:58:32,680 --> 00:58:33,170
but

956
00:58:33,170 --> 00:58:36,240
Windows 95 and NT in our office and
everything

957
00:58:36,240 --> 00:58:42,380
up and like sucking out BLM fixer I'm
gonna stop sending it you can't use it

958
00:58:42,380 --> 00:58:45,700
it's only for NT so their responses

959
00:58:45,700 --> 00:58:49,390
a couple hundred dollars per workstation
if you want security

960
00:58:49,390 --> 00:58:55,109
that's how we fix our operating system
yes we can open up for a questions

961
00:58:55,109 --> 00:58:58,880
anybody well well netanya multiprocessor
version

962
00:58:58,880 --> 00:59:04,250
that it works I'll yellow in the works
as a multiprocessor version if I can

963
00:59:04,250 --> 00:59:04,660
find

964
00:59:04,660 --> 00:59:09,859
quite enterprise down no not really I
have some access the sum so I'm working

965
00:59:09,859 --> 00:59:10,710
on that right now

966
00:59:10,710 --> 00:59:14,099
without I think

967
00:59:14,099 --> 00:59:17,819
I think we're gonna try and and make a
manual jumper a little bit as we go like

968
00:59:17,819 --> 00:59:21,150
five more minutes over which were
actually right on time right now

969
00:59:21,150 --> 00:59:24,200
and give people an opportunity to answer
to

970
00:59:24,200 --> 00:59:28,799
answer blessed be the best to ask a
couple questions anybody on the panel

971
00:59:28,799 --> 00:59:34,140
if there are any questions to be asked

972
00:59:34,140 --> 00:59:38,038
I at left us questions about India's set
work-up

973
00:59:38,039 --> 00:59:43,380
I'll talk to you about their appliances
nor cares about it on the anti side

974
00:59:43,380 --> 00:59:46,380
when you release your anti-sniper

975
00:59:46,380 --> 00:59:50,019
would you please allow it to allow it to

976
00:59:50,019 --> 00:59:53,440
safe directly to do this gotta never
general sniffer

977
00:59:53,440 --> 00:59:56,819
and I have to keep recycling traces so
fast

978
00:59:56,819 --> 01:00:00,650
because our network is so busy lover
churches right directly

979
01:00:00,650 --> 01:00:04,230
can you do that yeah on this number
that's coming out

980
01:00:04,230 --> 01:00:09,869
we're gonna do release basically I one
that works on UNIX first its

981
01:00:09,869 --> 01:00:14,000
easier I'm we did that at an Olympic
after BB effort definite or whatever you

982
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:15,339
want and the

983
01:00:15,339 --> 01:00:19,730
and key in the S&P back it's going back
and forth I don't know exactly when

984
01:00:19,730 --> 01:00:24,150
the microsoft-based one is going to come
out because they're not being very

985
01:00:24,150 --> 01:00:25,059
helpful since

986
01:00:25,059 --> 01:00:28,369
we don't have any money at all we're
doing is being a pain in the ass a

987
01:00:28,369 --> 01:00:32,450
they're not getting as any help writing
obviously but yes

988
01:00:32,450 --> 01:00:35,970
you'll be able to say that this don't
directly to stand out up

989
01:00:35,970 --> 01:00:39,720
maybe we'll even throw in a sniffer by
itself on the idea lock back by

990
01:00:39,720 --> 01:00:43,589
on itself so if you're bored be just the
thing up to run at night when you go

991
01:00:43,589 --> 01:00:44,029
home

992
01:00:44,029 --> 01:00:50,029
and it misses the net working crack some
at the same time

993
01:00:50,029 --> 01:00:56,200
she have a bus for the hardware side

994
01:00:56,200 --> 01:01:00,180
us for the Palm Pilots have been able to
act

995
01:01:00,180 --> 01:01:03,910
ship to get greatest or capacity need

996
01:01:03,910 --> 01:01:07,279
you tried again became named her the
chip to get

997
01:01:07,279 --> 01:01:12,339
greater storage capacity 0

998
01:01:12,339 --> 01:01:15,880
yep there's a on the back in this the

999
01:01:15,880 --> 01:01:20,509
the ramen Rob modules are removable just
to make the whole system modular

1000
01:01:20,509 --> 01:01:24,970
Anna that so you upgrade the OS from
there in and as a couple pads that a

1001
01:01:24,970 --> 01:01:29,579
that ship started yet so you can
basically just saw to surface about

1002
01:01:29,579 --> 01:01:34,440
chips on probably get like a I think
it's two mags without without any

1003
01:01:34,440 --> 01:01:35,480
additional hardware

1004
01:01:35,480 --> 01:01:39,559
except the ramp so get it is actually a
company out that it does

1005
01:01:39,559 --> 01:01:43,170
but you can do yourself a cheaper what
about the

1006
01:01:43,170 --> 01:01:46,630
3 make upgraded have now the flash

1007
01:01:46,630 --> 01:01:49,880
memory yeah the the upgrade the

1008
01:01:49,880 --> 01:01:53,210
flash this RAM chips so you can

1009
01:01:53,210 --> 01:01:56,329
load a larger Palm OS on it and

1010
01:01:56,329 --> 01:02:00,809
and others one memory module I think
allows you to play

1011
01:02:00,809 --> 01:02:04,289
a these DES Sonata

1012
01:02:04,289 --> 01:02:09,359
pseudo see it here am I think taken s
rampart at-risk

1013
01:02:09,359 --> 01:02:14,848
refresh held onto it down you can also
buy that from this there's a company on

1014
01:02:14,849 --> 01:02:15,170
the web

1015
01:02:15,170 --> 01:02:22,170
bashing your search you find it

1016
01:02:26,100 --> 01:02:29,730
i was just wondering if the PowerPoint
slide shows available on your website if

1017
01:02:29,730 --> 01:02:30,350
you're planning

1018
01:02:30,350 --> 01:02:35,490
making it up it's not there right now

1019
01:02:35,490 --> 01:02:39,960
but that's a good point %uh if power
plant some easy way I am

1020
01:02:39,960 --> 01:02:43,800
like the worst web person in the world
if our plan is an easy way to export out

1021
01:02:43,800 --> 01:02:44,620
an HTML

1022
01:02:44,620 --> 01:02:47,819
or may go to dump it out to get a poster
for whatever I'll do that

1023
01:02:47,820 --> 01:02:51,630
no probs yeah

1024
01:02:51,630 --> 01:02:55,960
I don't run NT or a Microsoft product so
I have to find somebody else's

1025
01:02:55,960 --> 01:03:00,640
machine that has it on their end I'll do
that outline applying a bit up in the

1026
01:03:00,640 --> 01:03:01,490
next to a

1027
01:03:01,490 --> 01:03:05,080
next week regards to arm

1028
01:03:05,080 --> 01:03:09,819
a site that was running I S as a web
server if they decide to use

1029
01:03:09,820 --> 01:03:12,840
NC security secure their pages

1030
01:03:12,840 --> 01:03:16,190
diversion factory setup remote attacks

1031
01:03:16,190 --> 01:03:23,190
using Shaw response to this the web
server with setup

1032
01:03:26,740 --> 01:03:29,560
I believe the same challenge response
that goes over the

1033
01:03:29,560 --> 01:03:33,580
you're on

1034
01:03:33,580 --> 01:03:36,580
just attached file shares the same
chance

1035
01:03:36,580 --> 01:03:43,580
mechanisms you captured should be able
to use

1036
01:03:45,880 --> 01:03:48,859
I have to ask because I know you need to
be brute force tracked

1037
01:03:48,859 --> 01:03:52,589
put the worst case scenarios like thirty
thousand years to crack passwords

1038
01:03:52,589 --> 01:03:56,380
songsters comparison how long off-track
well

1039
01:03:56,380 --> 01:04:00,910
on I have access you're gonna talk about
the Intel way of doing that I'll talk

1040
01:04:00,910 --> 01:04:04,239
on the first time

1041
01:04:04,239 --> 01:04:07,499
Iran prototype

1042
01:04:07,499 --> 01:04:11,249
was sort of like floored by how quickly
it happens

1043
01:04:11,249 --> 01:04:14,829
threes talking about no salt one round
yes

1044
01:04:14,829 --> 01:04:18,589
and and passerby split into

1045
01:04:18,589 --> 01:04:22,599
to have 7 max basically

1046
01:04:22,599 --> 01:04:26,039
you know overtime with a little bit
about position

1047
01:04:26,039 --> 01:04:30,719
and I did some benchmarking and desist
this is running on Intel hardware

1048
01:04:30,719 --> 01:04:36,709
which much tells me it's a lot quicker
an office park 64-bit but

1049
01:04:36,709 --> 01:04:41,019
dictionary tax generally you could
dictionary attack

1050
01:04:41,019 --> 01:04:44,249
the I was using a twenty thousand words
dictionary

1051
01:04:44,249 --> 01:04:47,549
card users for 200 under a minute

1052
01:04:47,549 --> 01:04:51,029
brute forcing up

1053
01:04:51,029 --> 01:04:54,650
reporting depends on the characters said
something

1054
01:04:54,650 --> 01:04:58,660
Meissen talk about too much 5.3 just two
alpha

1055
01:04:58,660 --> 01:05:02,308
alphanumeric you don't throw in
punctuation characters

1056
01:05:02,309 --> 01:05:06,369
you can brute force on any for $200 to
the hockey space

1057
01:05:06,369 --> 01:05:09,739
and by the day I

1058
01:05:09,739 --> 01:05:13,189
Heathrow if you throw in punctuation
characters is a good thing to do

1059
01:05:13,189 --> 01:05:16,359
if you are worried about your password
being secure against

1060
01:05:16,359 --> 01:05:19,479
forces to up to the key space

1061
01:05:19,479 --> 01:05:23,599
and I if you use punctuation your

1062
01:05:23,599 --> 01:05:27,269
your making it so that even even

1063
01:05:27,269 --> 01:05:32,189
tom wodel Ophcrack if you use some funky
punctuation characters you can make a

1064
01:05:32,189 --> 01:05:33,189
pass for that would take

1065
01:05:33,189 --> 01:05:37,679
few hundred days to crack not many
people remember those things

1066
01:05:37,679 --> 01:05:41,719
so you know tell your administrator to
throw in

1067
01:05:41,719 --> 01:05:44,890
an ampersand that that's a

1068
01:05:44,890 --> 01:05:47,959
that's a few hundred days which is still
less than a year I

1069
01:05:47,959 --> 01:05:51,739
to go through the entire the space way
to the made a difference the other thing

1070
01:05:51,739 --> 01:05:52,249
is

1071
01:05:52,249 --> 01:05:56,650
Y-twelve working on the Intel side of
things I was playing over on the office

1072
01:05:56,650 --> 01:05:59,140
park side of things which I really think
if anybody

1073
01:05:59,140 --> 01:06:02,598
isn't too fast breaking in trips and
moves and stuff

1074
01:06:02,599 --> 01:06:06,819
go get not just like the best bang for
the buck turn on all the optimization

1075
01:06:06,819 --> 01:06:10,060
make it was not portable code and

1076
01:06:10,060 --> 01:06:17,060
and that 100 days or so a drop down to
be about 20 alright

1077
01:06:18,370 --> 01:06:21,740
that's up all the questions I like to
thank you everybody here we've got

1078
01:06:21,740 --> 01:06:22,260
