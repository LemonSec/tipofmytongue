9
00:00:34,289 --> 00:00:38,960
digital yet killed the

10
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:42,600
RZ slash test HTML

11
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:47,359

13
00:00:50,510 --> 00:00:54,420
put up a little file so I can see what
numbers go to which characters

14
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:57,640
we get down to 153 we have a laser

00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:10,710
copyright symbol there's a sense side
162

18
00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:15,110
and though see down around

19
00:01:15,110 --> 00:01:20,130
very much better

20
00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:25,910
all and push a button

21
00:01:25,910 --> 00:01:30,300
okay high-tech done around number to
sixteen we've got this

22
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:34,740
with a slash in it girly I wonder what
we could do with that

23
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:38,190
well let's go on down and see what I'm
doing this weekend going to be on

24
00:01:38,190 --> 00:01:42,050
hope I've been to all these places and
following the con

25
00:01:42,050 --> 00:01:45,440
I intend to go to the computer museum in
boston and loft

26
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:48,910
with a slash in it Heavy Industries

27
00:01:48,910 --> 00:01:53,110
and all I've done actually I didn't use
the

28
00:01:53,110 --> 00:01:56,280
the number all the for

29
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:59,930
you s for sources I mean netscape

30
00:01:59,930 --> 00:02:06,930
PC under Internet Explorer what we find
in the source code for this

31
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:14,000
use

32
00:02:16,930 --> 00:02:19,930
L ampersand 0 slash

33
00:02:19,930 --> 00:02:22,959
semicolon which gives us a no slash

34
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:26,599
and put up the characters that one

35
00:02:26,599 --> 00:02:30,730
and then I put in a comment are you
looking to see how I got a slash

36
00:02:30,730 --> 00:02:35,879
0 and then give my email address that
gesture 2600 dot com because

37
00:02:35,879 --> 00:02:39,760
if you go alt airport to get rid of that
window

38
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:43,679
control L WWW dot

39
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:46,980
L 0 PhD got Cobb

40
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:50,250
we find it lost Heavy Industries

41
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:54,260
they have the graphic

42
00:02:54,260 --> 00:02:57,388
even they're all tags uses 0 character

43
00:02:57,389 --> 00:03:00,579
they had the slashing their graphic but
down below

44
00:03:00,579 --> 00:03:05,459
the use 0 character which under HTML
does not show a slash

45
00:03:05,459 --> 00:03:09,799
no core lost know where they've got the
zeros

46
00:03:09,799 --> 00:03:13,530
because it is cool spell kewl modern era

47
00:03:13,530 --> 00:03:17,560
up you buy that they don't have to slash
show up

48
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:20,889
so is mine more usually free

49
00:03:20,889 --> 00:03:25,129
wrong but the question then becomes

50
00:03:25,129 --> 00:03:28,310
using the all are back your love hero

51
00:03:28,310 --> 00:03:31,870
is mine really for having to slash 0 as
part of the character

52
00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:37,819
over here

53
00:03:37,819 --> 00:03:42,229
got tell that up showing by Cheshire
catalyst page and you'll notice

54
00:03:42,229 --> 00:03:46,049
that we've got the beyond hope logo
animated by me

55
00:03:46,049 --> 00:03:51,109
in square brackets the square bracket is
a clue to people with nine graphic web

56
00:03:51,109 --> 00:03:51,849
browsers like

57
00:03:51,849 --> 00:03:57,019
links which I'm using by using telnet
here and

58
00:03:57,019 --> 00:04:00,430
this is a clue that this is the alt tag

59
00:04:00,430 --> 00:04:03,819
image at the backslash key

60
00:04:03,819 --> 00:04:07,189
and we can see farther down here we've
got

61
00:04:07,189 --> 00:04:10,599
image source: equals in my images
directory

62
00:04:10,599 --> 00:04:15,549
things

63
00:04:15,549 --> 00:04:18,560
Kim accidentally wrong

64
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:25,560
here here

65
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:30,510
okay hope references to hope dotnet

66
00:04:30,510 --> 00:04:35,730
the image the sources images last BHM a
doctor which was the name of the file

67
00:04:35,730 --> 00:04:40,540
a line is all the stuff from there at
the Altair quote beyond ok logo

68
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:43,650
close quote border 0 and this

69
00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:48,280
allows you to have something that can be
/c by a user who does not

70
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:52,230
have graphics let's go back over here a
minute

71
00:04:52,230 --> 00:04:55,610
little further down the

72
00:04:55,610 --> 00:05:02,190
hope area the original beyond hope web
page

73
00:05:02,190 --> 00:05:05,780
actually is a page that I created

74
00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:09,720
on the places 100 email list about the
whole conference

75
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:13,740
for about a month the ever had to say
you know we really ought to have a web

76
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:16,090
page in you know somebody ought to have
to stop

77
00:05:16,090 --> 00:05:19,190
up on the web finally somebody wrote an
email to you know

78
00:05:19,190 --> 00:05:23,150
when we do the web page you don't have
this this that and the other such

79
00:05:23,150 --> 00:05:27,670
so I used his format I just started
putting things in

80
00:05:27,670 --> 00:05:30,950
now you'll notice that

81
00:05:30,950 --> 00:05:34,390
we have in line here

82
00:05:34,390 --> 00:05:37,440
okay let's come back over to

83
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:44,280
not skate let's go to the original
beyond hope

84
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:47,430
web page use light

85
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:54,220
here see what it looks like

86
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:58,800
over here now over here I've got these
little blue dots

87
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:01,840
okay like it's a real graphics

88
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:06,020
like web page so when we do love you

89
00:06:06,020 --> 00:06:11,740
source what we see we've done

90
00:06:11,740 --> 00:06:16,910
is we use a datalist

91
00:06:16,910 --> 00:06:21,380
up every got the image towards the blue
dot dot Jeff but the alt tag

92
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:24,409
equals quote asterisk close quote

93
00:06:24,410 --> 00:06:27,770
and we do this all the way down until

94
00:06:27,770 --> 00:06:31,310
we get down here where we seem to have
accidentally

95
00:06:31,310 --> 00:06:34,890
him forgot to put a the all equals

96
00:06:34,890 --> 00:06:39,300
quote asterisk and that gives us the
dreaded

97
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:44,600
in line message and this is what up
people with links

98
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:48,520
see when they don't have a graphic

99
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:51,810
or they have a graphic that does not
have an alt tag

100
00:06:51,810 --> 00:06:54,860
all equal to get them a textual idea

101
00:06:54,860 --> 00:06:59,940
what graphic is supposed to be there so
you wind up with pages it's a

102
00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:04,260
inline inline link link link link in
line is mapped and there's nothing I

103
00:07:04,260 --> 00:07:05,560
have to give the Lynx user

104
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:09,040
any clues one thing I hate

105
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:12,170
our programmers that bitch about
clueless users

106
00:07:12,170 --> 00:07:16,570
and then never put anything on the
screen that give them clues

107
00:07:16,570 --> 00:07:22,240
it's a pet peeve I'm sorry wide

108
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:27,180
thats you page all EPCOR will close that
window

109
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:30,590
down here we by that at the bottom his
original letter

110
00:07:30,590 --> 00:07:34,400
and I spent the time about the new york
city website the convention visit your

111
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:35,260
website

112
00:07:35,260 --> 00:07:38,500
and I'm leaning on buttons and excuse me

113
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:43,020
the email questions was to be put it
later

114
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:46,849
contributors page include and

115
00:07:46,850 --> 00:07:49,970
when we put airline here we see

116
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:54,800
that it was too the gestures home page
when you went to an annual goals team

117
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,210
that went to 2600 dot

118
00:07:56,210 --> 00:07:59,490
up so knows how to protect it was fun

119
00:07:59,490 --> 00:08:02,920
and geysers a letter he said this we met
with the webpage

120
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:06,030
can be done quite quickly and updated
maybe later day

121
00:08:06,030 --> 00:08:09,460
so I by thing as the suggested

122
00:08:09,460 --> 00:08:13,080
web page it will get updated on it but
get pretty this web page that work

123
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:19,050
measures art not record what school
Cheshire as I type that I realised yes

124
00:08:19,050 --> 00:08:23,180
at this lecture this page would be

125
00:08:23,180 --> 00:08:30,180
by graphic web school back over in the
nine graphic side

126
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:35,919
when you use the you well the a numbered
list

127
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:41,590
you get the asterisks you get the plus
signs it will bring it up somewhat for

128
00:08:41,590 --> 00:08:42,080
you

129
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:45,180
thing is you need to tell that in to

130
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:49,850

the

232
00:15:53,630 --> 00:15:58,820
for example you think really class

here it's badly for the dress template

242
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:52,160
you know it if we look up here

243
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:55,500
on the other page we see

244
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:58,700
that when I put it because I just got up

245
00:16:58,700 --> 00:17:02,880
it aliased to astor's template equals

246

260
00:18:03,620 --> 00:18:09,720
digital net Cheshire

261
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:16,170
politics

262
00:18:16,170 --> 00:18:20,520
digital you know all these FBI guys

263
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:24,930
Secret Service guys going on with the
politics are a bus hackers

264
00:18:24,930 --> 00:18:28,070
and

265
00:18:28,070 --> 00:18:35,070
group yeah

266
00:18:35,290 --> 00:18:41,490
okay my homepage so I finally put down

267
00:18:41,490 --> 00:18:45,530
my political agenda there's logos and
army

268
00:18:45,530 --> 00:18:49,970
Michael Douglas and I me which is the
supporters group for the US national

269
00:18:49,970 --> 00:18:53,890
soccer team it was the game the rest of
the world love

270
00:18:53,890 --> 00:18:57,900
americans are finally starting to pick
up and

271
00:18:57,900 --> 00:19:01,500
are getting into finally we're going to
dress the world with something and not

272
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:03,210
shoving it down their throats

273
00:19:03,210 --> 00:19:06,730
this is what I like about this is why I
think it's politics

274
00:19:06,730 --> 00:19:11,090
these are people who is this news with
go out the sporting games with

275
00:19:11,090 --> 00:19:14,309
up peace through killing each other

276
00:19:14,309 --> 00:19:20,090
of the soccer field but over here

277
00:19:20,090 --> 00:19:23,330
and the tell that side go to

278
00:19:23,330 --> 00:19:26,428
you

279
00:19:26,429 --> 00:19:29,730
see if town politics

280
00:19:29,730 --> 00:19:33,610
is good enough no okay so we'll just

281
00:19:33,610 --> 00:19:38,730
space on down but

282
00:19:38,730 --> 00:19:43,200
where I have a graphic on the one-page
over here

283
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:46,760
nothing shows up no link

284
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:50,270
no in like no asterisk and the reason
for that

285
00:19:50,270 --> 00:19:53,780
is that all equals quote quote

286
00:19:53,780 --> 00:19:57,590
ATL string so I have

287
00:19:57,590 --> 00:20:03,139
a strictly superfluous graphic for no
good reason other than to just show up

288
00:20:03,140 --> 00:20:06,190
the bunny head on the soccer ball which
looks cool the graphic people

289
00:20:06,190 --> 00:20:09,770
the nine graphic people don't have a
clue if they're and don't

290
00:20:09,770 --> 00:20:15,690
need one so this is you know one of the
little tricks for making a webpage

291
00:20:15,690 --> 00:20:20,160
more user-friendly two guys that can't
see or graphics

292
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:23,360
and who are the people who can't your
graphics besides the guy

293
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:26,460
the public libraries using the card
catalog for like

294
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:29,650
I do Wright County Library System in
Titusville Florida

295
00:20:29,650 --> 00:20:33,250
the blind kids these boys

296
00:20:33,250 --> 00:20:38,370
box you get a feel for it because
computers came around they got this

297
00:20:38,370 --> 00:20:38,690
piece

298
00:20:38,690 --> 00:20:42,160
size is going and just got working with
of

299
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:46,130
Along Came Windows they're just trying
to get their windows

300
00:20:46,130 --> 00:20:49,450
sup a software squared away and outcome

301
00:20:49,450 --> 00:20:53,020
flames give them a break

302
00:20:53,020 --> 00:20:56,090
people you can't just have low bat with

303
00:20:56,090 --> 00:21:00,740
you gotta have almost no band with that
allow these people to read your pages

304
00:21:00,740 --> 00:21:03,929
all I forget which page that

305
00:21:03,929 --> 00:21:07,770
go over analyze that show what I want
you

306
00:21:07,770 --> 00:21:12,418
MLS net and I'll try in NASCAR

307
00:21:12,419 --> 00:21:17,700
alright think analyst Major League
Soccer page and

308
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:22,179
if you have frame please put your
contents frames

309
00:21:22,179 --> 00:21:26,690
on right not the left the reason for
this is that

310
00:21:26,690 --> 00:21:30,730
links and not Rep browsers will start at
the top

311
00:21:30,730 --> 00:21:35,049
and of course you go from left to right
in English all and the first thing you

312
00:21:35,049 --> 00:21:36,690
come across as your content

313
00:21:36,690 --> 00:21:41,559
so you have to go through all those
content before it gets the content

314
00:21:41,559 --> 00:21:45,820
up that particular page if you put your
content

315
00:21:45,820 --> 00:21:49,770
frame on the right you get first
contents when you click on one of those

316
00:21:49,770 --> 00:21:51,340
things and then

317
00:21:51,340 --> 00:21:56,040
your references are at the bottom the

00:26:48,370 --> 00:26:51,600
slide on down the page best place to
park

388
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:55,940
for a space shuttle launch which is in
Titusville word unmanned Lodge

389
00:26:55,940 --> 00:26:59,149

397
00:27:24,899 --> 00:27:26,039
only graphic on the page

398
00:27:26,039 --> 00:27:29,610
because I have changed out the mission
patch every mission

399
00:27:29,610 --> 00:27:33,149
it's just too much about but

400
00:27:33,149 --> 00:27:36,320
this lies almost every mission where
there's ham operators on board

401
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:39,899
and ham radio is one of those few happy
you can take up

402
00:27:39,899 --> 00:27:43,500
with you space as recreation

403
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:46,740
as equipment that is potentially useful

404
00:27:46,740 --> 00:27:50,390
as emergency rescue equipment oh and in
fact

405

00:32:25,470 --> 00:32:29,929
there was a young freakin their freak
acker showing off his home page

474
00:32:29,929 --> 00:32:34,360
social they're serving I took down the
URL went back to the library brought up

475
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:35,760
link to the URL

476
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:41,139
it was all click link are in line in
line is map link link link

477
00:32:41,139 --> 00:32:46,730
your browser's Sox the only all tag on
the entire page was

478
00:32:46,730 --> 00:32:51,129
your browser sucks you just knew that it
was part up the

479
00:32:51,129 --> 00:32:55,730
illustration the kids white put his page
didn't know was there

480
00:32:55,730 --> 00:32:59,030
so that is the absolute worst case I'll

481
00:32:59,030 --> 00:33:04,928
a graphic web page I've ever run across

482
00:33:04,929 --> 00:33:08,840
so here we got the energy hack gallery
it's got a small graphic but mostly

483
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:12,080
it is but nine to graphics

484
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:16,139
and will be over here if we go back

485
00:33:16,139 --> 00:33:20,100
you for up we buy it hasn't inline image

486
00:33:20,100 --> 00:33:23,570
that we don't really need it it's not
too bad has

487
00:33:23,570 --> 00:33:26,639
the by year by location by topic

488
00:33:26,639 --> 00:33:30,350
so that means that here with got

489
00:33:30,350 --> 00:33:34,510
the images to use all the calls quote
quote

490
00:33:34,510 --> 00:33:37,929
so these guys have been sensitized to
the issue

491
00:33:37,929 --> 00:33:41,919
now notice also that they got the great
background

492
00:33:41,919 --> 00:33:47,059
by pages I generally tend to have a
white background

493
00:33:47,059 --> 00:33:50,700
this is the only time I really cared for
the graphic route

494
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:54,450
I think the grey socks I called
executive great

495
00:33:54,450 --> 00:33:58,980
to make it you know sound like 22
insulting sometimes

496
00:33:58,980 --> 00:34:04,530
but the term executive gray should be
insulting up

497
00:34:04,530 --> 00:34:08,279
and this is the but the only counter
that God

498
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:11,530
pages 89 one so far

499
00:34:11,530 --> 00:34:18,530
up see oh the web accessible

500
00:34:19,359 --> 00:34:23,418
here and if we click on that

501
00:34:23,418 --> 00:34:26,418
where we go also notice you are reading
it should be gone

502
00:34:26,418 --> 00:34:30,379
you know I got the URL of the page here
okay

503
00:34:30,379 --> 00:34:33,330
why would anybody peoples have to do
that they're looking at the page I will

504
00:34:33,330 --> 00:34:34,299
be there

505
00:34:34,299 --> 00:34:37,569
if somebody prints out the page

506
00:34:37,569 --> 00:34:42,960
handed the somebody else that person
will be able to find your page

507
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:46,790
little things that really make a webpage
work

508
00:34:46,790 --> 00:34:49,690
this is the National Center for
accessible media where they discuss the

509
00:34:49,690 --> 00:34:50,899
budget is accessibility

510
00:34:50,899 --> 00:34:55,190
things and up because I make pages or
accessible

511
00:34:55,190 --> 00:34:58,950
I grab their logo and ran with it

512
00:34:58,950 --> 00:35:02,919
the XOR various companies that are
involved now

513
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:06,270
for this listing waterlogged where
people are getting sensitized

514
00:35:06,270 --> 00:35:10,609
you know what check back in a month guy
does it again its Readers Digest

515
00:35:10,609 --> 00:35:14,000
Johnson bucks good

516
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:17,000
up

517
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:20,500
see up alt left 0

518
00:35:20,500 --> 00:35:27,500
to go backwards and that backwards again

519
00:35:28,049 --> 00:35:32,810
backwards again backwards again

520
00:35:32,810 --> 00:35:36,310
being foolish to go all schieffer go

521
00:35:36,310 --> 00:35:40,049
but I want for for the Cheshire Cat was
homepage

522
00:35:40,049 --> 00:35:45,520
what you do is copy down by URL

523
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:48,660
which at the bottom there http://

524
00:35:48,660 --> 00:35:52,330
notice no www that won't get your page

525
00:35:52,330 --> 00:35:56,900
digital that net slashed chill d Chae

526
00:35:56,900 --> 00:36:02,390
SH I R you so

527
00:36:02,390 --> 00:36:05,670
if you get there at the top of the page

528
00:36:05,670 --> 00:36:09,200
crucified my email address click on that

529
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:13,650
ship email it's just Cheshire at 2600
doc

530
00:36:13,650 --> 00:36:17,060
it may be a week or two before get back
because I expect a budget email when I

531
00:36:17,060 --> 00:36:18,710
get home

532
00:36:18,710 --> 00:36:23,030
but I I will respond to email

533
00:36:23,030 --> 00:36:26,080
and a course up links compatible

534
00:36:26,080 --> 00:36:29,230
which is linked to enhance and proud
other

535
00:36:29,230 --> 00:36:35,589
which mean probably get disappears page
here

536
00:36:35,589 --> 00:36:40,000
summer somewhere

537
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:44,520
oh yah at UTC 9704 22

538
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:47,810
that's going nowhere fast go of your a
minute

539
00:36:47,810 --> 00:36:51,869
talking about getting people clues okay
70 4.2 is very strange

540
00:36:51,869 --> 00:36:56,000
format so the clue is click the
hyperlink

541
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:59,619
it takes you out to university in
germany to explain to you

542
00:36:59,619 --> 00:37:06,619
that what I am using is waiting for it
to come around on the guitar

543
00:37:07,390 --> 00:37:10,879
it is the international standard date
time

544
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:16,569
notation love year month day hour minute
second

545
00:37:16,569 --> 00:37:21,390
income future store double order

546
00:37:21,390 --> 00:37:24,420
and thats the real trick their

547
00:37:24,420 --> 00:37:28,859
again you know links available for my
hope a city Cup these damn

548
00:37:28,859 --> 00:37:33,600
I do have a link from your job as the
Space Launch FAQ page

549
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:37,960
the higher media today you remember the
covered call

550
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:40,960
okay it really is good

551
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:44,359
you haven't been there also the Capitol
steps to do political humor

552
00:37:44,359 --> 00:37:49,440
Washington DC that a song about the
wonderful stuff

553
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:54,880
and do we have a sound hooked up

554
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:58,109
you know their their speakers in here
now

555
00:37:58,109 --> 00:38:05,109
okay is not coming out okay

556
00:38:05,230 --> 00:38:06,740
okay the trick is

557
00:38:06,740 --> 00:38:11,870
that they play the soundtrack to bash oh
here comes

558
00:38:11,870 --> 00:38:18,870
worst

559
00:38:26,820 --> 00:38:31,060
okay its it's it's not worth it don't
worry don't worry but it's just plain is

560
00:38:31,060 --> 00:38:32,250
a MIDI file

561
00:38:32,250 --> 00:38:35,410
pleased with the music to mash K

562
00:38:35,410 --> 00:38:41,529
ever members the TV

563
00:38:41,530 --> 00:38:43,800
okay who remembers the movie

564
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:47,630
there were words back that what were the
words

565
00:38:47,630 --> 00:38:51,910
suicide is painless it brings on many
changes

566
00:38:51,910 --> 00:38:55,640
and that was the joke there well you can
see their road

567
00:38:55,640 --> 00:39:00,350
their web pages article part you know
the graphic links

568
00:39:00,350 --> 00:39:04,020
this job you say no the different
graphics

569
00:39:04,020 --> 00:39:07,870
so it's hard to break down it's been a
few months now but

570
00:39:07,870 --> 00:39:13,310
this this week this this parity site
with up within 24 hours the news

571
00:39:13,310 --> 00:39:13,830
breaking

572
00:39:13,830 --> 00:39:18,069
and so I immediately linked to it

573
00:39:18,070 --> 00:39:21,080
and it was really great stuff

574
00:39:21,080 --> 00:39:24,720
funny if you go down these links its
it's hilarious

575
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:27,770
sick I admit but hilarious

576
00:39:27,770 --> 00:39:32,110
yep

577
00:39:32,110 --> 00:39:35,930
that's why where I got this I got this
whole warning about it

578
00:39:35,930 --> 00:39:40,430
you know but internet parlors rolling on
the floor laughing my ass off

579
00:39:40,430 --> 00:39:46,950
sick but funny so if if you read it at
your own risk oh yeah but political

580
00:39:46,950 --> 00:39:49,690
agenda is deaf to the shootout but
that's all

581
00:39:49,690 --> 00:39:54,630
thing for the world game in the world
rules this counter is we go up

582
00:39:54,630 --> 00:39:59,270
to the Ozzies baseline viewing page on
this page just look at the counter

583
00:39:59,270 --> 00:40:01,230
without committing it so I can see how
many

584
00:40:01,230 --> 00:40:04,240
have gone were other users for

585
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:08,820
are and the trick is folks yes I am
ozzie I've been

586
00:40:08,820 --> 00:40:12,670
real hearted

587
00:40:12,670 --> 00:40:16,780
is a part subtype the trickiest everyone
knows no like it says at the top of the

588
00:40:16,780 --> 00:40:17,180
page

589
00:40:17,180 --> 00:40:21,980
okay the Cheshire Cat this is really
Richard Cheshire former drift ap

590
00:40:21,980 --> 00:40:23,570
photo/the Cheshire Cheshire

591
00:40:23,570 --> 00:40:27,020
you don't know everything tackle Richard
but only salesman ever tried to call a

592
00:40:27,020 --> 00:40:27,530
dick

593
00:40:27,530 --> 00:40:32,490
the thing is that they want to know with
just got was this

594
00:40:32,490 --> 00:40:36,220
a course Richard Cheshire the other
Peter Parker spider-man

595
00:40:36,220 --> 00:40:39,640
they know superman is park at a third
level the object

596
00:40:39,640 --> 00:40:43,529
for privacy purposes doesn't occur to
most people my real name is Robert of

597
00:40:43,530 --> 00:40:43,970
business

598
00:40:43,970 --> 00:40:47,460
the privacy issue when I get that phone
call it a night a Cheshire

599
00:40:47,460 --> 00:40:51,150
I know what direction you coming from
okay

600
00:40:51,150 --> 00:40:54,440
that the whole thing it is the worst
kept secret on

601
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:57,790
forgot and i'm happy to tell you when
we're together

602
00:40:57,790 --> 00:41:01,279
like this but I asked the journalists
just

603
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:06,410
keep it you know quite fact in the 1982
technology also read your article

604
00:41:06,410 --> 00:41:09,779
which up by ACO 3 acting years ago

605
00:41:09,780 --> 00:41:12,930
up the author there

606
00:41:12,930 --> 00:41:17,589
hello really great thing let me control
f 25 page

607
00:41:17,590 --> 00:41:23,350
kept up well that's taking too long

608
00:41:23,350 --> 00:41:26,480
okay the quote was the Cheshire Cat
a-listers

609
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:32,100
his real name back it is even israel
pseudonym either

610
00:41:32,100 --> 00:41:35,680
very very angry at that and I loved it I
thought the white just yes

611
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:38,680
that say because I'm not really trying
to hide it

612
00:41:38,680 --> 00:41:44,049
it strictly the privacy issue so you
find me you've got this route

613
00:41:44,050 --> 00:41:47,190
to get down to BRT pages if you want
space

614
00:41:47,190 --> 00:41:50,960
now let's let's go to space that the
minute

615
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:54,410
and show you some other stuff link to

616
00:41:54,410 --> 00:41:59,490
okay there's that

617
00:41:59,490 --> 00:42:03,950
that nice big space to click on

618
00:42:03,950 --> 00:42:10,830
because free space kids out there

619

00:42:29,140 --> 00:42:32,440
link around the global it was like a

624
00:42:32,440 --> 00:42:36,120
fifty-page article it goes on for ever
do not read it

625
00:42:36,120 --> 00:42:39,779
on the web bring it up click File

626
00:42:39,780 --> 00:42:43,080

would highlight it people highlight also

675
00:46:16,980 --> 00:46:23,980
little trick

680
00:46:58,010 --> 00:47:02,299
hero said the HTTP

681
00:47:02,299 --> 00:47:05,440
URL's I want to be able to click on your
Netscape mail

682
00:47:05,440 --> 00:47:08,890
it says mail to Colin and for us quiet
and said

683
00:47:08,890 --> 00:47:12,529
work which is call sign at the Everett
is a letter

684
00:47:12,529 --> 00:47:16,059
nation is just a a dot forward file out
there

685
00:47:16,059 --> 00:47:19,880
but because mail to is an actual URL

686
00:47:19,880 --> 00:47:23,420
netscape highlights that email we see

687
00:47:23,420 --> 00:47:27,250
so they can just click on that rather
than reach up to the reply but

688
00:47:27,250 --> 00:47:32,019
actually I've got friends who are so
clueless they have begun to reply but

689
00:47:32,019 --> 00:47:35,779
yet but something comes up blew a
hyperlink

690

that we can figure out that the
government got out so

691
00:47:40,309 --> 00:47:43,559
that way I make sure that side this is
my permanent

692
00:47:43,559 --> 00:47:47,890
email address because it's a router the
forward file ever change are two

693
00:47:47,890 --> 00:47:49,210
