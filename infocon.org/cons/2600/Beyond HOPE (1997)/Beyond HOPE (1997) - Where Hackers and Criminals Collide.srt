1
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:44,090
of ever here

2
00:01:44,090 --> 00:01:47,670
welcome to be on top after dark

3
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:52,430
where the new york times

4
00:01:52,430 --> 00:01:56,310
this happened last time to accept this
time or in the magazine section which

5
00:01:56,310 --> 00:01:59,270
means they they actually wrote this
article x ever weeks ago

6
00:01:59,270 --> 00:02:01,270
for two get into the color section

7
00:02:01,270 --> 00:02:05,880
or they say about us hackers for hiring
or they got that from

8
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:08,819
this weekend thousands of computer
hackers are gathered in the plot

9
00:02:08,819 --> 00:02:13,080
building in manhattan for beyond hope
billed as the largest hacker convention

10
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:19,589
ever well we didn't bill it that way
they did um... but they probably is

11
00:02:19,589 --> 00:02:22,689
there's all kinds of uh... we're going
to earlier uh... panels in everything

12
00:02:22,689 --> 00:02:25,529
from credit card security which i don't
think we've talked about

13
00:02:25,529 --> 00:02:29,769
uh... to hacking new york's metropolitan
to be happening tomorrow afternoon

14
00:02:29,769 --> 00:02:33,709
uh... the event is also drawing
four-part wraps and various government

15
00:02:33,709 --> 00:02:35,609
outfits like darpa

16
00:02:35,609 --> 00:02:39,150
who are on hand not to arrest but to
hire

17
00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:44,019
so um... go out there and get hired i
guess

18
00:02:44,019 --> 00:02:48,129
why we all know that the cyber cafe
being hacked job

19
00:02:48,129 --> 00:02:51,749
kind of funny isn't it but if you do
hack something

20
00:02:51,749 --> 00:02:53,138
the uh...

21
00:02:53,139 --> 00:02:54,559
the nice about it

22
00:02:54,559 --> 00:02:58,978
and leave plenty of backups of the
people can put it back to the way it was

23
00:02:58,979 --> 00:03:01,649
we don't condone that kind of thing by
the way

24
00:03:01,649 --> 00:03:05,139
all right our next panelist are winkler
will be speaking about hackers and

25
00:03:05,139 --> 00:03:06,609
criminals

26
00:03:06,609 --> 00:03:09,529
should be quite interesting and don't go
anywhere after this we have our g_s_

27
00:03:09,529 --> 00:03:11,239
empanel going on

28
00:03:11,239 --> 00:03:14,120
the worry about the rave it's gonna be
happening all night long so if you want

29
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:21,120
to go there to play time to get there as
well

30
00:03:25,219 --> 00:03:27,029
how it's working

31
00:03:27,029 --> 00:03:31,389
okay uh... basically i came up with a
title it's originally

32
00:03:31,389 --> 00:03:35,149
uh... irish they gave this presentation
of death time an adept con they were

33
00:03:35,149 --> 00:03:38,629
trying to figure out a good title for a
and the name changed about three or four

34
00:03:38,629 --> 00:03:41,809
times and what happened was jeff moss
thoughtful

35
00:03:41,809 --> 00:03:43,319
bt sorry

36
00:03:43,319 --> 00:03:46,349
dat thought to be a good thing named
after michael corporate espionage

37
00:03:46,349 --> 00:03:47,759
a hold on

38
00:03:47,759 --> 00:03:48,579
she plot

39
00:03:48,579 --> 00:03:51,090
by the book everybody says it's great
not just me

40
00:03:51,090 --> 00:03:53,759
but i'm biased

41
00:03:53,759 --> 00:03:55,520
so was corporate espionage

42
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:58,460
then it turned out where hackers and
criminals collide because

43
00:03:58,460 --> 00:04:01,719
i kinda don't want to teach people how
to go out and commit espionage

44
00:04:01,719 --> 00:04:04,079
specially nothing like setting like this
where

45
00:04:04,079 --> 00:04:07,869
people are likely to use it

46
00:04:07,869 --> 00:04:09,339
this kind of like a little bit

47
00:04:09,339 --> 00:04:12,390
you know i a opening thing for in my
opinion because again

48
00:04:12,390 --> 00:04:15,050
like one of the palace i believe lewis
called said

49
00:04:15,050 --> 00:04:18,709
online happy to be here because it's
among the best in the brightest

50
00:04:18,709 --> 00:04:22,379
well i personally don't believe that
being hairston wearing a black t-shirt

51
00:04:22,379 --> 00:04:24,410
makes you the best or the brightest

52
00:04:24,410 --> 00:04:26,820
so i'm here to see you know again

53
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:29,209
i'm here to try to like hoping your eyes

54
00:04:29,209 --> 00:04:31,750
and just to give me an idea what i'm
seeing around here

55
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:35,530
i'm seeing some people like learn some
really elite things

56
00:04:35,530 --> 00:04:36,620
yes

57
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:39,009
he had stashed a u_s_

58
00:04:39,009 --> 00:04:42,889
then followed by killed minus nine
number

59
00:04:42,889 --> 00:04:45,789
you know if that's the type of stuff you
think is a lead and all that makes you

60
00:04:45,789 --> 00:04:46,930
leading edge

61
00:04:46,930 --> 00:04:47,689
you know

62
00:04:47,689 --> 00:04:49,759
you need help

63
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:53,159
and then a lot of people also when i was
up there during the tiger team testing

64
00:04:53,159 --> 00:04:55,520
came over to me and said

65
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:56,448
you know the body

66
00:04:56,449 --> 00:04:58,860
now that password sniffing stuff

67
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:01,349
what how does that work i can see that

68
00:05:01,349 --> 00:05:03,990
you know and they don't know how
passwords nothing's done

69
00:05:03,990 --> 00:05:07,539
i think people know how password
sniffing stunt

70
00:05:07,539 --> 00:05:10,770
now this is scary because half of you
don't

71
00:05:10,770 --> 00:05:12,580
this is a major problem

72
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:13,409
you know again

73
00:05:13,409 --> 00:05:17,099
password sniffing is a basic concept in
any sort of hacking

74
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:19,110
but the thing is i get worried here

75
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:20,209
when i hear people say

76
00:05:20,209 --> 00:05:23,169
i'll be a hacker then you'll get a high
paying job

77
00:05:23,169 --> 00:05:25,568
and that's not going to happen

78
00:05:25,569 --> 00:05:28,429
you know again just because you're an
actor it doesn't mean you know what

79
00:05:28,429 --> 00:05:29,240
you're doing

80
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:31,469
it means you call yourself a hacker

81
00:05:31,469 --> 00:05:32,849
and additionally

82
00:05:32,849 --> 00:05:36,680
the problem is the people who are least
technically skilled present the biggest

83
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:37,649
problems

84
00:05:37,649 --> 00:05:39,140
causes these people

85
00:05:39,140 --> 00:05:40,248
'cause ida well

86
00:05:40,249 --> 00:05:46,490
let me start by next lights are

87
00:05:46,490 --> 00:05:47,420
okay anyway

88
00:05:47,420 --> 00:05:48,490
this is what i do

89
00:05:48,490 --> 00:05:51,150
farley i was with the national security
agency

90
00:05:51,150 --> 00:05:54,689
i perform work for other intelligence
agencies after i got out of there

91
00:05:54,689 --> 00:05:57,449
and while i was in their and again did a
bunch of stuff

92
00:05:57,449 --> 00:06:00,199
right now i'm performing penetration
testing

93
00:06:00,199 --> 00:06:03,449
so uh... some people call me the best
social engineer in the world and again

94
00:06:03,449 --> 00:06:06,590
if you read my book or read my articles
which are out there on the internet

95
00:06:06,590 --> 00:06:08,189
you'll see why

96
00:06:08,189 --> 00:06:11,839
and also uh... you know bunch in
newspapers call me the modern-day james

97
00:06:11,839 --> 00:06:13,650
bond in all that sort of garbage

98
00:06:13,650 --> 00:06:15,189
i'll talk about this in a second

99
00:06:15,189 --> 00:06:19,290
again i've taken over banks using only
telephones i've stolen billions in a day

100
00:06:19,290 --> 00:06:22,909
i've given it back but again that's i
did this all legally

101
00:06:22,909 --> 00:06:24,370
and again

102
00:06:24,370 --> 00:06:26,900
else investigate computer related crimes

103
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:31,230
so not only i guess you know i learn a
few tracks investigated crimes were more

104
00:06:31,230 --> 00:06:32,360
often than not

105
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:34,449
they become big problems

106
00:06:34,449 --> 00:06:35,529
because

107
00:06:35,529 --> 00:06:39,280
i don't learn anything new with all you
people breaking into systems

108
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:42,569
you're not on the leading edge for the
most part you know like it

109
00:06:42,569 --> 00:06:45,999
what the guy who barton meets or
something like that he was out there

110
00:06:45,999 --> 00:06:48,620
saying there aren't very many good hacks
going on

111
00:06:48,620 --> 00:06:49,680
and that's true

112
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:52,669
next slide please

113
00:06:52,669 --> 00:06:57,520
uh... now even when i am catching them
they're not good

114
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:59,870
okay first of all my attitude on this

115
00:06:59,870 --> 00:07:03,249
unfortunately again you know being
called the modern-day james bond

116
00:07:03,249 --> 00:07:05,729
when you read it and when i write about
it

117
00:07:05,729 --> 00:07:08,690
you're gonna see if i don't really think
what i do is unique

118
00:07:08,690 --> 00:07:10,039
i lie to people

119
00:07:10,039 --> 00:07:11,770
i hacked into computers

120
00:07:11,770 --> 00:07:15,229
and to me that's not special and i've
been quoted as saying i could train a

121
00:07:15,229 --> 00:07:18,029
monkey to hack a computer within two
hours

122
00:07:18,029 --> 00:07:19,139
and that's true

123
00:07:19,139 --> 00:07:23,520
i can teach anyone you little tools
kitties out there a software poppies to

124
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:26,859
go ahead and have to computer with the
best within two hours

125
00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:29,139
all you need to know is the right
information

126
00:07:29,139 --> 00:07:32,930
again breaking into a computer systems
pretty mindless these days

127
00:07:32,930 --> 00:07:35,800
and again most of all it takes is nerve
in the willingness to commit criminal

128
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:36,930
actions

129
00:07:36,930 --> 00:07:40,460
that's all really takes to be a hacker
these days again people call let me say

130
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:42,550
people calling themselves a hacker

131
00:07:42,550 --> 00:07:45,330
cuz i think there are a lot of people
calling themselves i have heard who

132
00:07:45,330 --> 00:07:48,619
really aren't hackers and i think the
better ones know what i mean

133
00:07:48,619 --> 00:07:49,470
and again

134
00:07:49,470 --> 00:07:52,590
you know as far as people getting jobs
it's much easier for me to train an

135
00:07:52,590 --> 00:07:54,720
honest person tak like a criminal

136
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:56,569
than it is for me to train a hacker

137
00:07:56,569 --> 00:07:59,109
and make them act like an honest person

138
00:07:59,109 --> 00:08:02,710
there's again the people i look forward
to do penetration test with me

139
00:08:02,710 --> 00:08:06,870
are primarily good system administrators
who i have to do is teacher few little

140
00:08:06,870 --> 00:08:09,169
skills teach them how to do things in
reverse

141
00:08:09,169 --> 00:08:10,989
that's life

142
00:08:10,989 --> 00:08:13,360
oak and as far as this presentation goes

143
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:16,460
i'm not here to teacher criminal methods
i think too many people are going to use

144
00:08:16,460 --> 00:08:19,309
them abut again you know i guess they
don

145
00:08:19,309 --> 00:08:22,349
some sort of prostitute is something do
you want to learn how you can buy my

146
00:08:22,349 --> 00:08:23,779
book or go on the internet

147
00:08:23,779 --> 00:08:29,969
it's available for free or my book is
really good you can all take your pick

148
00:08:29,969 --> 00:08:34,139
okay let's talk about criminals and the
hackers let's talk about how hackers and

149
00:08:34,139 --> 00:08:39,740
criminals collide that will go into some
details on actual criminal hacks

150
00:08:39,740 --> 00:08:42,180
d cover that up please

151
00:08:42,180 --> 00:08:49,180
or just unplug it

152
00:08:59,050 --> 00:09:01,880
yeah this is really sophisticated

153
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:05,630
first of all let me talk about the inner
circle the circles are what i consider

154
00:09:05,630 --> 00:09:07,720
to be the hacker community

155
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:10,900
outlines a little bit on will for
something before i go into this

156
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:12,510
five perceive people

157
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:14,700
growing into the hackers

158
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:18,090
what i see is a i mean in my opinion
even though i don't think a lot of many

159
00:09:18,090 --> 00:09:22,110
hackers i think they do go into hacking
for well-meaning purposes

160
00:09:22,110 --> 00:09:25,980
for the most part i've seen what
elementary schools teach students

161
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:26,980
in other words

162
00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:30,250
they teach students a little bit about
computers they teach them how to buddha

163
00:09:30,250 --> 00:09:30,739
mob

164
00:09:30,739 --> 00:09:33,810
and go through reader rabbit for six
years

165
00:09:33,810 --> 00:09:36,710
and then if you go through rita rabbit
decline in interest it'll open in

166
00:09:36,710 --> 00:09:37,420
computers

167
00:09:37,420 --> 00:09:38,839
and one of our and more

168
00:09:38,839 --> 00:09:41,450
and they have to go to your teachers
that i want to learn more and they like

169
00:09:41,450 --> 00:09:42,170
sorry

170
00:09:42,170 --> 00:09:45,610
than you don't go to ask your mother get
your tutor and the odds are that are

171
00:09:45,610 --> 00:09:46,860
almost nil

172
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:49,510
so what happens you get out there on the
internet

173
00:09:49,510 --> 00:09:53,220
and you run into people on the internet
you run into things you run into wanting

174
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:55,059
to do fun things

175
00:09:55,059 --> 00:09:56,589
now what are fun things well

176
00:09:56,589 --> 00:09:57,709
computer hacking

177
00:09:57,709 --> 00:10:00,880
that's the simplest in the easiest thing
that come to mind

178
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:04,160
you know again there's out there's
people out there tell u all your freedom

179
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:05,809
fighter if you're a hacker

180
00:10:05,809 --> 00:10:09,309
you know you're protecting the world if
you're a hacker you're really a lead if

181
00:10:09,309 --> 00:10:13,149
europe after the meeting is out there
helping this would stupid movies like

182
00:10:13,149 --> 00:10:15,520
the movie hackers for example

183
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:17,760
and you know it's really cool

184
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:19,170
you know so what do you do

185
00:10:19,170 --> 00:10:22,660
you go ahead and with an honest effort
to be cut learn more about the puter as

186
00:10:22,660 --> 00:10:24,030
you get sucked in

187
00:10:24,030 --> 00:10:26,939
but the people out there a telling all
breaking into computers

188
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:28,440
that makes you leave

189
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:31,580
you know breaking into computers makes
you a boy or while talk about that the

190
00:10:31,580 --> 00:10:32,460
into my briefing

191
00:10:32,460 --> 00:10:34,000
but anyway

192
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,090
that's my impression help people become
happens usually have to have to get a

193
00:10:37,090 --> 00:10:38,129
real job

194
00:10:38,129 --> 00:10:39,829
you know most of you outgrow this stuff

195
00:10:39,829 --> 00:10:43,720
because most people again aren't that
good aren't good enough to get jobs to

196
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:46,100
penetration testing all talk about that

197
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:48,550
okay now back to this thing

198
00:10:48,550 --> 00:10:50,680
first of all there's this in a circle
here

199
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:52,050
these are the people that

200
00:10:52,050 --> 00:10:55,470
for lack of a better term i what i
consider the true geniuses

201
00:10:55,470 --> 00:10:58,240
you've got people in your like minds

202
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:01,290
route other people like this and what
these people do

203
00:11:01,290 --> 00:11:04,420
is they find problems with software
programs

204
00:11:04,420 --> 00:11:08,979
hacking is nothing more well exploiting
a computer is nothing more than finding

205
00:11:08,980 --> 00:11:14,029
a problem with an operating system or
some sort of computer application

206
00:11:14,029 --> 00:11:15,259
and what happens is

207
00:11:15,259 --> 00:11:17,410
these people are the smart ones

208
00:11:17,410 --> 00:11:20,469
these people are the real genius is that
the media would like to portray as the

209
00:11:20,470 --> 00:11:21,649
evil people

210
00:11:21,649 --> 00:11:24,180
but these are the people that are out
there just trying to

211
00:11:24,180 --> 00:11:28,000
learn about computers like every hacker
claims they are trying to do

212
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,420
so again you got these people finding
problems with computers

213
00:11:31,420 --> 00:11:34,540
they put out the information to anyone
that wants it

214
00:11:34,540 --> 00:11:37,129
they also pointed out to the second
inner circle

215
00:11:37,129 --> 00:11:40,299
these are the people that are
necessarily sprite you know as as smart

216
00:11:40,299 --> 00:11:41,800
as much or bobbitt

217
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:45,730
but these are people that go out and can
really use these tools very well

218
00:11:45,730 --> 00:11:49,029
they can actually develop tools off the
information developed by this in a

219
00:11:49,029 --> 00:11:50,340
circle

220
00:11:50,340 --> 00:11:54,030
then you have what i consider the rest
the hacker game by the way i you know i

221
00:11:54,030 --> 00:11:55,629
from what i've been able to see

222
00:11:55,629 --> 00:11:58,779
despite out two hundred people in the
inner circle maybe about a thousand and

223
00:11:58,779 --> 00:11:59,860
two thousand people

224
00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:03,759
on the uh... on the second inner circle
they got the outer circle

225
00:12:03,759 --> 00:12:07,079
and these are what hobby and much at all
those other people consider to be

226
00:12:07,079 --> 00:12:09,680
clueless teenagers

227
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:13,889
and again these are people that take the
information that the genius is due

228
00:12:13,889 --> 00:12:17,670
and they go ahead and use the tools to
break into computers

229
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:21,459
and again you break sickly they're using
tools to break into computers they try

230
00:12:21,460 --> 00:12:24,170
to prove their elite and all that sort
of stuff

231
00:12:24,170 --> 00:12:27,150
and what they end up doing is feeding
information

232
00:12:27,150 --> 00:12:30,150
back into the work that the other half
or so for example

233
00:12:30,150 --> 00:12:32,309
when i'm investigating computer crimes

234
00:12:32,309 --> 00:12:36,439
alcee some clueless teenagers out there
who break into a bank

235
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:39,100
you know again they'll get delphi
building some password guessing they'll

236
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:43,200
find an account without pay user i_d_
dumb tax n mail for a hundred fifty

237
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:43,910
times

238
00:12:43,910 --> 00:12:46,219
and i'll be able to buy the user idea in
a bank

239
00:12:46,220 --> 00:12:49,760
then the first thing they like to do is
go out and to the world hey guys i

240
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:52,090
believe i'm not a loser

241
00:12:52,090 --> 00:12:53,210
so what are they do

242
00:12:53,210 --> 00:12:58,990
on of bulletin boards they go ahead and
say hey i'm really cool gimme wearers

243
00:12:58,990 --> 00:13:02,960
nine people of harassing that posting

244
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:05,950
these are the people that are includes
actually read it and get a laugh out of

245
00:13:05,950 --> 00:13:06,900
it

246
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:09,820
because all other clueless people say oh
he's a leave let me give them whatever i

247
00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:10,620
have

248
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:11,650
but anyway

249
00:13:11,650 --> 00:13:15,160
these people are out there they go ahead
in order to prove that they know

250
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:16,040
something

251
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:19,640
they'll say here's the account i found
here's the credit card number i found or

252
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:21,420
whatever

253
00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:25,230
so attacks into computers end up getting
put out on the internet

254
00:13:25,230 --> 00:13:28,650
or bulletin boards or wherever but
primarily the worldwide web is where

255
00:13:28,650 --> 00:13:30,900
allow disinformation sets

256
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:34,540
then again these are those of the inner
circles they've got these little things

257
00:13:34,540 --> 00:13:37,800
that kind of look like an airplane
airplane propeller actually that's the

258
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:39,480
way half opic called it

259
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:41,130
but anyway what happens is

260
00:13:41,130 --> 00:13:45,590
you have these ellipses out here which i
consider criminals over here this side

261
00:13:45,590 --> 00:13:49,510
and foreign intelligence agencies over
here at the side

262
00:13:49,510 --> 00:13:51,160
now what happens is the far end

263
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:53,910
well let's talk about organized crime

264
00:13:53,910 --> 00:13:57,030
this ellipse i say goes a little bit
into the inner circle cause there are

265
00:13:57,030 --> 00:14:01,040
people in what i consider the inner
circle that are working for criminal

266
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:01,849
elements

267
00:14:01,850 --> 00:14:04,290
it's incredibly profitable to work for
them

268
00:14:04,290 --> 00:14:09,010
and some of them have used their skills
again primarily for criminal purposes

269
00:14:09,010 --> 00:14:11,120
now what happens is they go ahead

270
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:14,999
and organized crime tends to use their
own people which is the section out here

271
00:14:14,999 --> 00:14:17,159
the you some of the clueless people
cause

272
00:14:17,159 --> 00:14:19,889
you know they're good to take a fall
let's put them out on the women

273
00:14:19,889 --> 00:14:23,710
ifn by takes the fall it'll be them
which is most of you i think

274
00:14:23,710 --> 00:14:26,870
anyway then you got a few people on the
inner circle and so on

275
00:14:26,870 --> 00:14:30,580
organized crime also has a few of their
own geniuses those all those little

276
00:14:30,580 --> 00:14:32,070
circles there

277
00:14:32,070 --> 00:14:34,519
now what happens is these little
geniuses

278
00:14:34,519 --> 00:14:37,769
are the people for example if you talk
about the russian mafia russian mafia is

279
00:14:37,769 --> 00:14:38,709
very good

280
00:14:38,709 --> 00:14:43,099
at recruiting former k_g_b_ train people
the g_r_u_ the russian military

281
00:14:43,099 --> 00:14:44,870
intelligence agency

282
00:14:44,870 --> 00:14:48,300
basic indirect rate have some of the
best computer hackers in the world

283
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:51,680
and it's much more profitable to work
for their organized crime

284
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:55,870
as oppose the russian military new by
the way is a pain anybody at the moment

285
00:14:55,870 --> 00:15:00,320
so you got over a bunch of really good
people working for organized crime

286
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:01,589
and what they do is

287
00:15:01,589 --> 00:15:05,259
primarily they look at the information
that's already out there they were they

288
00:15:05,259 --> 00:15:06,980
get the tools

289
00:15:06,980 --> 00:15:10,070
they get the information like here's an
account on this bank or here's an

290
00:15:10,070 --> 00:15:11,389
account in this company

291
00:15:11,389 --> 00:15:12,569
and they go ahead

292
00:15:12,569 --> 00:15:16,840
and hacking using the information that
these little clueless people provide

293
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:18,430
they end up going in there

294
00:15:18,430 --> 00:15:20,800
and using that information to steal
money

295
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:23,370
or steal information or whatever the
case is

296
00:15:23,370 --> 00:15:27,370
sometimes these really smart people will
end up putting out some more tools

297
00:15:27,370 --> 00:15:29,450
because if they develop an attack

298
00:15:29,450 --> 00:15:32,830
that's it fairly easy to guess but it's
kind of

299
00:15:32,830 --> 00:15:35,710
you know if it's if it's fairly easy to
guess what's going on but it looks a

300
00:15:35,710 --> 00:15:37,110
very advanced in new

301
00:15:37,110 --> 00:15:39,650
what they'll do is they'll put out the
tool

302
00:15:39,650 --> 00:15:42,850
too though into the internet through
some like you know anonymous postings

303
00:15:42,850 --> 00:15:44,150
and things like that

304
00:15:44,150 --> 00:15:47,069
and then all the whereas kiddies in
everybody start picking up on these

305
00:15:47,070 --> 00:15:48,300
tools

306
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:50,620
and then those whereas kiddies end up
going out

307
00:15:50,620 --> 00:15:53,520
and using these tools much more than the
criminals do

308
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:57,660
so finally when the criminals this when
the criminals decide to use the tools

309
00:15:57,660 --> 00:15:59,750
what's happening is

310
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:02,880
they're using this tool which is using
this attack

311
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:06,460
which is being hit in by all you other
clueless people out there running those

312
00:16:06,460 --> 00:16:08,230
attacks

313
00:16:08,230 --> 00:16:12,320
so you're hiding or real crimes and
again when i've investigated bank

314
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:13,859
robberies and stuff like this

315
00:16:13,859 --> 00:16:17,159
for for and stuff like that for every
one real crime i'm supposed to be

316
00:16:17,159 --> 00:16:20,949
investigating are usually end up running
off investigating a dozen little petty

317
00:16:20,949 --> 00:16:24,470
crimes like stupid password guessing
trying things like

318
00:16:24,470 --> 00:16:30,220
field service on route no password rude
rude rude juror or whatever

319
00:16:30,220 --> 00:16:31,909
for all you people are guessing it

320
00:16:31,909 --> 00:16:35,290
every time i see one of those i kind of
have to stop what i'm doing

321
00:16:35,290 --> 00:16:38,329
and figuring out if it's some clueless
person which you usually is

322
00:16:38,329 --> 00:16:42,269
or it's somebody just doing some forward
reconnaissance to see how easy would be

323
00:16:42,269 --> 00:16:44,660
to break into the spanker organization

324
00:16:44,660 --> 00:16:46,759
to go back and steal information later

325
00:16:46,759 --> 00:16:49,829
'cause again the criminals are out there
using the same tools

326
00:16:49,829 --> 00:16:52,050
and they're lazy they want to do it
quickly

327
00:16:52,050 --> 00:16:54,820
so that they get the highest paid back
and they're going to try to default

328
00:16:54,820 --> 00:16:56,480
things just like you do

329
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:59,929
so if you think own oh well the
intention is good let me tell you

330
00:16:59,929 --> 00:17:03,238
the difference in in tension between
hackers and criminals is about five

331
00:17:03,239 --> 00:17:04,850
keystrokes

332
00:17:04,849 --> 00:17:08,550
you have to see what's going on up until
the point where those five keystroke

333
00:17:08,550 --> 00:17:09,389
sergei

334
00:17:09,390 --> 00:17:13,190
for example if it's a competitor warning
to take down the company all you have to

335
00:17:13,190 --> 00:17:15,100
do is take foreign star

336
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:18,700
you know r m star returned five
keystrokes they've wiped out a whole

337
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:20,409
corporate network possibly

338
00:17:20,409 --> 00:17:22,610
survey on the stand that one at least
our agm

339
00:17:22,610 --> 00:17:25,660
everybody know what our anis

340
00:17:25,660 --> 00:17:29,000
r m remove

341
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,140
no problem

342
00:17:30,140 --> 00:17:32,299
uh... so anyway that's what happens

343
00:17:32,299 --> 00:17:35,039
they got the foreign intelligence
agencies essentially doing the same

344
00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:35,870
things

345
00:17:35,870 --> 00:17:40,200
and if a car or foreign intelligence
agency needs something they go ahead

346
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:43,769
and if the fight for example they want
to break into a specific organization

347
00:17:43,769 --> 00:17:46,730
they'll go out in two point attackers
are really trying to prove that they

348
00:17:46,730 --> 00:17:47,620
really

349
00:17:47,620 --> 00:17:50,360
and they'll go out and say all if you
were cool

350
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:54,050
or if you are if you weren't the loser
that you are you'll go ahead and get a

351
00:17:54,050 --> 00:17:56,090
login at this company

352
00:17:56,090 --> 00:17:59,090
and then the actor will eventually go
out and get along with the company what

353
00:17:59,090 --> 00:17:59,899
they do is

354
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:03,220
they use the clueless hackers to do
their late work like i said and again

355
00:18:03,220 --> 00:18:05,859
foreign intelligence agencies organized
crime

356
00:18:05,859 --> 00:18:07,710
all tend to use the same methods

357
00:18:07,710 --> 00:18:09,260
in-game information

358
00:18:09,260 --> 00:18:11,210
any questions on that

359
00:18:11,210 --> 00:18:15,290
go elya

360
00:18:15,290 --> 00:18:18,070
sorrows

361
00:18:18,070 --> 00:18:19,929
flap proof of the links

362
00:18:19,930 --> 00:18:26,930
yet lol i personally witness most of
them

363
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:35,649
well actually for example on

364
00:18:35,649 --> 00:18:39,409
one of them is fairly well i've seen far
intelligence agencies by the way i'll

365
00:18:39,409 --> 00:18:43,910
talk about this in a second q s t
bulletin board anybody you know that

366
00:18:43,910 --> 00:18:46,980
if you're happy back in them early
nineteen nineties

367
00:18:46,980 --> 00:18:50,769
to usd an a_ c_ k_ which is a german
bulletin board system

368
00:18:50,769 --> 00:18:53,480
were the places to go in exchange
information

369
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:57,730
q s t is run by the french foreign
intelligence agency that the g_s_a_

370
00:18:57,730 --> 00:19:02,060
she eight c_k_ is supposedly run by
project for a half which is uh... the

371
00:19:02,060 --> 00:19:04,379
boom well whatever be andy breaks out
too

372
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:06,799
which is the german foreign intelligence
agency

373
00:19:06,799 --> 00:19:10,500
so there were out there planting
soliciting information

374
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:13,510
and all this information was following
through these bulletin boards maintained

375
00:19:13,510 --> 00:19:15,750
by the foreign intelligence agencies

376
00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:17,310
now talk about a few more

377
00:19:17,310 --> 00:19:19,909
well talking a few more

378
00:19:19,910 --> 00:19:22,560
take the book open

379
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:24,399
k'nex line

380
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:28,800
okay let's talk about examples of crimes
as mentioning before about on how people

381
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:30,240
are tong did

382
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:33,720
uh... in one case we saw this person
which we do traced back to the russian

383
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:34,580
mafia

384
00:19:34,580 --> 00:19:37,259
and he was out there on all the bulletin
boards could be kept noticing this

385
00:19:37,259 --> 00:19:38,210
pattern

386
00:19:38,210 --> 00:19:41,610
where he would be on this bulletin board
saying all if you are any good to have

387
00:19:41,610 --> 00:19:44,330
something at this bank if you're any
good to have something at this bank

388
00:19:44,330 --> 00:19:46,379
during good yeah something at this bank

389
00:19:46,380 --> 00:19:50,299
and eventually he found some eyes like
all yeah well i have since i have super

390
00:19:50,299 --> 00:19:51,500
user there

391
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:53,210
as i can really prove it

392
00:19:53,210 --> 00:19:54,730
and the kid gave him

393
00:19:54,730 --> 00:19:59,370
the super user privileges for a system
which was an s or the financial trading

394
00:19:59,370 --> 00:20:00,160
systems

395
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:03,480
but it did provide the criminal foot in
the dorcas we watched him come back into

396
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:04,700
the organization

397
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:05,870
try to break in

398
00:20:05,870 --> 00:20:08,970
and try to get super user privileges
based on that

399
00:20:08,970 --> 00:20:12,679
next on there's the israeli government
which is doing an awful lot of this

400
00:20:12,679 --> 00:20:16,799
a lot of times in the rolling in the
u_s_ the jewett israeli government

401
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:19,168
is really good for recruiting people

402
00:20:19,169 --> 00:20:21,320
based based upon being jewish

403
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:24,540
and they go ahead and they have a lot of
people out there for example comming

404
00:20:24,540 --> 00:20:27,428
industrial espionage for example
jonathan pollard

405
00:20:27,429 --> 00:20:31,359
you have the navy cases which are going
on besides apology dot some other people

406
00:20:31,359 --> 00:20:34,769
and again most of this you know they're
going out income convincing people do

407
00:20:34,769 --> 00:20:35,910
espionage

408
00:20:35,910 --> 00:20:38,410
there also convincing a bunch of jewish
hackers

409
00:20:38,410 --> 00:20:40,430
to travel over to israel

410
00:20:40,430 --> 00:20:44,290
and they're putting them up for aguirre
to and their out there hacking and i

411
00:20:44,290 --> 00:20:47,960
know people who know the person who's
out there have been out was really good

412
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:49,630
and again there been other people

413
00:20:49,630 --> 00:20:51,480
well this was actually a good one

414
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:55,029
uh... my nose person works for a very
large company

415
00:20:55,029 --> 00:20:56,309
and what happened was

416
00:20:56,309 --> 00:20:59,850
they had some might hacking into a
computer system

417
00:20:59,850 --> 00:21:01,509
align which was

418
00:21:01,509 --> 00:21:02,570
essentially

419
00:21:02,570 --> 00:21:04,980
dot under a defense

420
00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:06,560
sent into a building

421
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:08,409
and then hooked onto the network

422
00:21:08,410 --> 00:21:10,900
and it turns out when they followed that
back to link

423
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:13,940
he turned out to go right to the israeli
embassy

424
00:21:13,940 --> 00:21:16,570
so again you know just little things
like that

425
00:21:16,570 --> 00:21:19,439
but of course they'll never get the
media 'cause nobody likes

426
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:23,500
noi like sat down

427
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:26,070
israelis are hacking u_s_ computers

428
00:21:26,070 --> 00:21:28,500
everybody's hacking u_s_ computers

429
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:30,100
you know it's a given

430
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:34,300
u_s_'s like height you know u_s_ is
still the technology leader in the world

431
00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:36,980
were invented even though everybody says
oh the japanese

432
00:21:36,980 --> 00:21:40,169
the japanese are good at taking
technologies in using them in innovative

433
00:21:40,169 --> 00:21:41,019
ways

434
00:21:41,019 --> 00:21:43,720
they're not good at developing the
technologies up front

435
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:45,230
i for example the walkman

436
00:21:45,230 --> 00:21:48,420
the walkman is nothing more than u_s_
develop technologies put together in a

437
00:21:48,420 --> 00:21:49,890
unique way

438
00:21:49,890 --> 00:21:53,640
and same thing with software programs
and things like that

439
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:55,810
then there was project black book

440
00:21:55,810 --> 00:21:59,889
and again this is where the japanese
were recruiting a lot of u_s_ hackers

441
00:21:59,890 --> 00:22:02,610
and again people i know i've been
personally approaching and these are

442
00:22:02,610 --> 00:22:05,070
some of the real elite ones

443
00:22:05,070 --> 00:22:08,110
and they were approached by the japanese
government

444
00:22:08,110 --> 00:22:11,460
hey we can make light very easy for you
if you come over here

445
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:12,990
and do what you love doing

446
00:22:12,990 --> 00:22:15,800
the u_s_ government doesn't appreciate
the hackers like we do

447
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:17,059
why don't you come here

448
00:22:17,059 --> 00:22:18,950
and we will love you for it

449
00:22:18,950 --> 00:22:22,320
and again

450
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:25,260
there were three three people that we
know that they go over a month the

451
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:27,420
arrest them turned them down

452
00:22:27,420 --> 00:22:31,830
anyway on there's also hackers being
solicited on a regular basis

453
00:22:31,830 --> 00:22:34,070
i don't know that uh... they're better
hack well

454
00:22:34,070 --> 00:22:36,789
let me tell you about the criminal
underworld now this will be of gold for

455
00:22:36,789 --> 00:22:38,110
half of you are bad

456
00:22:38,110 --> 00:22:42,440
but what happens is they're a bunch of
hackers are known to be very good

457
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:44,059
you know there are people out there

458
00:22:44,059 --> 00:22:47,029
who liked post really good stuff to
bulletin boards

459
00:22:47,029 --> 00:22:50,260
there's also those anonymous posting
stalled out twenty six hundred anybody

460
00:22:50,260 --> 00:22:51,180
ever see one

461
00:22:51,180 --> 00:22:53,940
where you know happier you know come
here and

462
00:22:53,940 --> 00:22:56,010
if you're good and you've done cracking

463
00:22:56,010 --> 00:22:59,450
you'll respond back to the synonymous
address i've seen three of them over

464
00:22:59,450 --> 00:23:01,309
like a past three years

465
00:23:01,309 --> 00:23:02,660
but what happens is

466
00:23:02,660 --> 00:23:05,760
people replied to those most summer jobs

467
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:09,160
but every so often there's one or two
which say hehe

468
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:12,249
if you can get this file and what they
do is they test them

469
00:23:12,249 --> 00:23:15,929
became a file that they know it's hard
to get they say if you can do this will

470
00:23:15,929 --> 00:23:17,029
give you money

471
00:23:17,029 --> 00:23:20,460
and again that's just to get them
something say go ahead and they get

472
00:23:20,460 --> 00:23:21,860
about thousand dollars fraph

473
00:23:21,860 --> 00:23:25,690
for getting this file then what happens
is their periodically test

474
00:23:25,690 --> 00:23:29,620
and the way it works again testing is
done primarily for anonymous email

475
00:23:29,620 --> 00:23:31,600
and what happens is you send back

476
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:32,839
you send back your

477
00:23:32,839 --> 00:23:35,270
the program the file whatever

478
00:23:35,270 --> 00:23:37,289
to the people anonymously

479
00:23:37,289 --> 00:23:40,260
and then you get a check from a
seven-eleven money order

480
00:23:40,260 --> 00:23:42,780
in the mail sometime in the near future

481
00:23:42,780 --> 00:23:46,039
and apparently i know to people that
have told me they did it any game we

482
00:23:46,039 --> 00:23:47,930
check this out little bit

483
00:23:47,930 --> 00:23:49,980
doesn't look like they're lying

484
00:23:49,980 --> 00:23:52,570
and when i asked them how many other
people they know they're doing it

485
00:23:52,570 --> 00:23:56,189
they say there's about a hundred hackers
out there who make a living doing this

486
00:23:56,190 --> 00:23:59,460
for example they'll say that on average
they get paid one to two thousand

487
00:23:59,460 --> 00:24:01,469
dollars per person doing this

488
00:24:01,469 --> 00:24:02,980
some of them work in teams

489
00:24:02,980 --> 00:24:05,590
but for example it might be five people
working together

490
00:24:05,590 --> 00:24:09,019
well charts like two thousand dollars a
pop but these five people can keep

491
00:24:09,019 --> 00:24:11,600
on an ongoing basis taking a lot of
these jobs

492
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:13,700
they say on average if you're really
good

493
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:17,360
and they know you and somehow you're
into this little very tight network

494
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:20,860
you can make on average a hundred
thousand a year

495
00:24:20,860 --> 00:24:24,450
and that's kinda like the profession
line a little in very organized

496
00:24:24,450 --> 00:24:27,870
but that's a little underground there
that does that there's also another set

497
00:24:27,870 --> 00:24:32,059
of people where some people just no you
owe you claim to be a hacker

498
00:24:32,059 --> 00:24:34,149
i know one guy who was solicited

499
00:24:34,149 --> 00:24:37,690
by this couple that said hey you know
you're kind of like famous arches like

500
00:24:37,690 --> 00:24:40,370
well yeah now what happened was they
said

501
00:24:40,370 --> 00:24:43,009
they approached him like a month later
and said look this is what we want you

502
00:24:43,009 --> 00:24:43,549
to do

503
00:24:43,549 --> 00:24:45,879
we want you to come into our company

504
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:49,910
on this day we will let we will get you
into the company after-hours and we want

505
00:24:49,910 --> 00:24:53,150
to go ahead transfer five million
dollars for us and you could take

506
00:24:53,150 --> 00:24:56,700
whatever you can get the czar company
does financial transactions

507
00:24:56,700 --> 00:24:58,770
you put one into the computer system

508
00:24:58,770 --> 00:25:02,000
it'll run the next day and they need to
go ahead keep whatever

509
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,520
that he's like well

510
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:05,019
you know won't you be caught

511
00:25:05,019 --> 00:25:09,160
as like no we know that they only audit
the computer system once a month

512
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:12,299
so in other words will have a month to
get out of the country

513
00:25:12,299 --> 00:25:15,540
again the guy tells me turned it down to
be nice to think so but anyway that's a

514
00:25:15,540 --> 00:25:16,549
separate story

515
00:25:16,549 --> 00:25:19,309
but this or stuff goes on again another
hacker i know

516
00:25:19,309 --> 00:25:20,670
was approached by

517
00:25:20,670 --> 00:25:25,429
uh... this is actually kinda funny a
porno a guy who runs a portal website

518
00:25:25,429 --> 00:25:26,600
and what happened was

519
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:28,350
he said i want to find out

520
00:25:28,350 --> 00:25:32,289
with this other competing portal website
offers them for what prices

521
00:25:32,289 --> 00:25:36,370
by also wanna find out their customers
are so i could go ahead and solicit

522
00:25:36,370 --> 00:25:39,480
their customers so i can offer them
cheaper porno

523
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:40,549
and again you know

524
00:25:40,549 --> 00:25:43,429
i would imagine a lot of that goes on
'cause i don't know how many people

525
00:25:43,429 --> 00:25:46,400
i think there was one study i think a
few people can correct me

526
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:47,190
but wasn't it like

527
00:25:47,190 --> 00:25:50,240
porno on the internet civilian dollar
industry

528
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:53,790
does that kind of people read the same
thing but again its work a lot of money

529
00:25:53,790 --> 00:25:56,940
might not be a billion dollars but it's
worth a lot of money

530
00:25:56,940 --> 00:26:00,580
that is the biggest commercial use of
the internet as far as i know

531
00:26:00,580 --> 00:26:05,470
okay i also met those are a few examples
of hackers being solicited for crimes

532
00:26:05,470 --> 00:26:09,340
i'd also mention that u_s_d_a_ they seek
a bulletin boards that are ryan

533
00:26:09,340 --> 00:26:12,330
it was kinda cool let me tell you the
way some i've found that u_s_ t

534
00:26:12,330 --> 00:26:13,259
was a run by

535
00:26:13,259 --> 00:26:15,639
deje counts are part of the deje asi

536
00:26:15,639 --> 00:26:17,159
is kinda funny a hacker

537
00:26:17,159 --> 00:26:21,890
hacked the bulletin board and found that
it was taxed to the deje asi network

538
00:26:21,890 --> 00:26:24,730
and again that's just really stupid
basie here the foreign intelligence

539
00:26:24,730 --> 00:26:27,500
agencies make stupid mistakes

540
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:30,640
i'm excited ease

541
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:32,800
okay now let me talk about this

542
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:35,920
now getting back to this like the inner
circle the outer circle that's kind of

543
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:38,690
like the examples of basic rights of
talk about the morris

544
00:26:38,690 --> 00:26:40,529
the presentation goes on

545
00:26:40,529 --> 00:26:44,270
but the real hackers the people that are
out there trying to lauren about

546
00:26:44,270 --> 00:26:45,190
computers

547
00:26:45,190 --> 00:26:48,590
are offended by all the people that are
out there breaking cuz they say

548
00:26:48,590 --> 00:26:50,210
you give us a bad name

549
00:26:50,210 --> 00:26:51,889
there was at this on black

550
00:26:51,889 --> 00:26:55,159
we were at the black cap briefings which
was right before death time

551
00:26:55,159 --> 00:26:58,499
where the heck it's got together and
support professionals

552
00:26:58,499 --> 00:27:02,720
how to protect their computers based
upon how people penetrate computers

553
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:03,940
and what happened was

554
00:27:03,940 --> 00:27:06,330
you know they were there meet the
hackers and i don't consider this a

555
00:27:06,330 --> 00:27:08,040
typical hacker panel

556
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:11,820
you know you had hobbits you had route
you had mileage

557
00:27:11,820 --> 00:27:13,389
and a few other people

558
00:27:13,390 --> 00:27:16,419
you know those are your typical hackers
a nearby say well what about all those

559
00:27:16,419 --> 00:27:17,299
people

560
00:27:17,299 --> 00:27:20,329
they're just out there using the tools
you developed to break in

561
00:27:20,329 --> 00:27:24,080
and their core was there not hackers
they're clueless teenagers

562
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:27,280
now if i asked how many of you are
clueless teenagers that just using tools

563
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:28,839
to break into systems

564
00:27:28,839 --> 00:27:31,100
or just grabs people give your tell you

565
00:27:31,100 --> 00:27:34,870
all the type in p_s_ minus a u_s_
sinning till

566
00:27:34,870 --> 00:27:38,160
you know i'd bet if any of u_s_ it
honestly about half the room would raise

567
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:39,549
your hands

568
00:27:39,549 --> 00:27:40,700
so again

569
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:45,060
you know this is they start getting
offended by this next please

570
00:27:45,060 --> 00:27:48,280
k they say gives hackers a bad name
talked about that

571
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:52,690
and they use the term again they use the
term feliz teenagers not hackers

572
00:27:52,690 --> 00:27:53,600
and again

573
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:55,720
this is kind of you know hit on me
because

574
00:27:55,720 --> 00:27:57,380
i'm saying here try to figure out

575
00:27:57,380 --> 00:28:00,279
who goes in which circles anyway
containing

576
00:28:00,279 --> 00:28:03,909
and again their quote was hacking is
about learning

577
00:28:03,909 --> 00:28:07,590
not about breaking into computers
breaking into computers again is totally

578
00:28:07,590 --> 00:28:08,490
clueless

579
00:28:08,490 --> 00:28:12,370
hacking is about warning about the
internals about computers networking

580
00:28:12,370 --> 00:28:14,419
headed to new in unique things with it

581
00:28:14,419 --> 00:28:15,899
finding problems with it

582
00:28:15,899 --> 00:28:20,610
it's not about running sendmail a
hundred fifty times next

583
00:28:20,610 --> 00:28:23,260
okay and let's talk about r_u_ clueless

584
00:28:23,260 --> 00:28:27,000
let's figure out if you fit into these
categories

585
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,620
some of you already kinda get the
feeling you know where you are that's

586
00:28:29,620 --> 00:28:30,340
good

587
00:28:30,340 --> 00:28:32,990
okay it's a ten point asp

588
00:28:32,990 --> 00:28:36,039
and see what circle you fit into

589
00:28:36,039 --> 00:28:38,500
and again this came at a black at
discussions it

590
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:41,929
i kinda check the questions i would much
in hobby to see if they're fair

591
00:28:41,929 --> 00:28:44,289
and again the purpose of this is just
the sea

592
00:28:44,289 --> 00:28:46,580
if you're really out there break into
computers

593
00:28:46,580 --> 00:28:49,929
where you're really out there to learn

594
00:28:49,930 --> 00:28:51,900
anyway next

595
00:28:51,900 --> 00:28:53,249
okay first question

596
00:28:53,249 --> 00:28:56,519
have you ever written app third
generation language program are more

597
00:28:56,519 --> 00:28:57,990
than five hundred lines

598
00:28:57,990 --> 00:29:02,659
well let me ask this cut i think people
know what a third-generation languages

599
00:29:02,659 --> 00:29:04,559
all this is the fed

600
00:29:04,559 --> 00:29:07,190
third-generation languages like c

601
00:29:07,190 --> 00:29:10,960
basic is even a third generate marol

602
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:12,139
etcetera

603
00:29:12,139 --> 00:29:14,040
okay next

604
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:17,500
one points for yes

605
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:20,210
and the reason for this as a question

606
00:29:20,210 --> 00:29:24,010
is that if you can't program a slightly
complex program

607
00:29:24,010 --> 00:29:27,789
you're it then you really don't
understand operating system source code

608
00:29:27,789 --> 00:29:31,669
puzzles operating systems you break into
are nothing more than a series of source

609
00:29:31,669 --> 00:29:33,749
code their programs

610
00:29:33,749 --> 00:29:37,100
you know l sendmail isn't just this
thing that's camille lead there for

611
00:29:37,100 --> 00:29:38,809
hackers to break into them

612
00:29:38,809 --> 00:29:43,920
sent mails actually a software program
that's supposed to do it useful thing

613
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:45,740
sangli keep that in mind

614
00:29:45,740 --> 00:29:51,300
and subtract a half-point if you've
never programs

615
00:29:51,300 --> 00:29:56,350
can you understand attack scripts
line-by-line

616
00:29:56,350 --> 00:29:58,659
one point three s

617
00:29:58,659 --> 00:30:02,360
and if you don't bother looking at them
before you've run and then you're really

618
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:03,830
stupid

619
00:30:03,830 --> 00:30:08,090
you know if you're going to go to a
website and download a hacker program

620
00:30:08,090 --> 00:30:11,450
you know let's face it their first
packet be let's see which morons gonna

621
00:30:11,450 --> 00:30:13,290
download this program

622
00:30:13,290 --> 00:30:15,740
and does run it without checking it out

623
00:30:15,740 --> 00:30:19,110
you'd be surprised now made people are
there i know some by that went to you

624
00:30:19,110 --> 00:30:21,039
know the job i hacked page

625
00:30:21,039 --> 00:30:24,379
they went ahead and set click on this
for the job a hack

626
00:30:24,380 --> 00:30:26,200
and he said well wait a second let me

627
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:29,870
he had a clue and the first thing he did
was turn off java

628
00:30:29,870 --> 00:30:31,590
then it clicked on the wait a minute

629
00:30:31,590 --> 00:30:33,630
chug away for a second that's like

630
00:30:33,630 --> 00:30:37,320
how the hell a my gun out go ahead and
destroy your hard drive if you have java

631
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:38,800
turned off

632
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:42,950
so anyway i just think that in mind

633
00:30:42,950 --> 00:30:47,120
kenya port scripts to other platforms

634
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:49,340
one point for yes

635
00:30:49,340 --> 00:30:54,130
and then this basically shows that you
understand attack scripts and know the

636
00:30:54,130 --> 00:30:57,289
difference between different operating
systems environments

637
00:30:57,289 --> 00:30:58,340
for example

638
00:30:58,340 --> 00:31:00,450
the load module a tax credit

639
00:31:00,450 --> 00:31:03,269
is going to run one way on a celeste box

640
00:31:03,269 --> 00:31:07,970
that's gonna run another way on in h_p_
box and so on in you have to know where

641
00:31:07,970 --> 00:31:09,370
where to look for files

642
00:31:09,370 --> 00:31:10,289
and maybe

643
00:31:10,289 --> 00:31:12,720
well that's the next question go ahead

644
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:15,530
you can modify the tools for
optimization

645
00:31:15,530 --> 00:31:17,110
or bob fixes

646
00:31:17,110 --> 00:31:19,790
you know a lot of the tools well go on

647
00:31:19,790 --> 00:31:21,920
one point for yes

648
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:26,179
and again tools had varying quality and
it shows that you can understand them in

649
00:31:26,179 --> 00:31:26,960
other words

650
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:30,880
they would be cool when i'm writing an
exploitation script i delet off the

651
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:35,179
internet and yes i'd aloe them off the
internet when doing penetration testing

652
00:31:35,179 --> 00:31:37,689
this hey i'm getting paid and i wanna do
it quickly

653
00:31:37,689 --> 00:31:40,710
but i'm going to take those scripts look
at 'em line-by-line

654
00:31:40,710 --> 00:31:43,359
and then make like a super attack script
on it

655
00:31:43,359 --> 00:31:46,730
that automatically goes out searches
likely directories

656
00:31:46,730 --> 00:31:49,190
and says hey wait a second this is this
type of box

657
00:31:49,190 --> 00:31:52,200
then this files in this location in
needs these paramus

658
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:55,889
so you go ahead and write a nice little
tax group which optimizes what's going

659
00:31:55,889 --> 00:31:58,750
on

660
00:31:58,750 --> 00:32:00,780
this is a big question in my mind

661
00:32:00,780 --> 00:32:02,889
have you at least tried

662
00:32:02,889 --> 00:32:05,200
and applied to the word is tried

663
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:08,669
to write your own attack script based
often advisory for example you have

664
00:32:08,669 --> 00:32:11,230
certain advisory sciatica eyes res

665
00:32:11,230 --> 00:32:13,190
yep postings to bog track

666
00:32:13,190 --> 00:32:16,150
yep postings to cipher ponds and things
like that

667
00:32:16,150 --> 00:32:20,380
and you find out they say here is a
problem with the computer

668
00:32:20,380 --> 00:32:23,730
you should go out and if you really want
to learn about them peters

669
00:32:23,730 --> 00:32:25,570
you should try to say hey

670
00:32:25,570 --> 00:32:30,030
i'm gonna see if i have half a brain i'm
gonna see it well unless if i can apply

671
00:32:30,030 --> 00:32:32,990
what i learned and develop my own
attacks propnex

672
00:32:32,990 --> 00:32:34,820
one point for yes

673
00:32:34,820 --> 00:32:38,370
subtract three points for now and again

674
00:32:38,370 --> 00:32:41,230
this shows your understanding and more
importantly

675
00:32:41,230 --> 00:32:42,489
your willingness

676
00:32:42,489 --> 00:32:46,220
to apply what you've learned i don't
condone here i am attack scripts in

677
00:32:46,220 --> 00:32:46,800
doing it

678
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:50,460
by realize you're going to try to use
them but the question is are do you have

679
00:32:50,460 --> 00:32:51,550
half a brain

680
00:32:51,550 --> 00:32:53,220
and the energy and effort

681
00:32:53,220 --> 00:32:55,919
willing to try to go ahead and apply it

682
00:32:55,919 --> 00:32:59,630
what you claim to be learned about them
theaters next

683
00:32:59,630 --> 00:33:03,710
have you ever installed lenox or another
units operating system on your own

684
00:33:03,710 --> 00:33:05,890
computer system

685
00:33:05,890 --> 00:33:11,820
i'll even give u_n_c_ server what the
hell

686
00:33:11,820 --> 00:33:14,679
one point for yes

687
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:17,740
and again this is really gain your hands
on the internals cuz

688
00:33:17,740 --> 00:33:21,129
i don't think you should be hacking
somebody else's computer system

689
00:33:21,129 --> 00:33:23,390
before it right back in your own

690
00:33:23,390 --> 00:33:25,019
and again it's free

691
00:33:25,019 --> 00:33:28,749
you can get limits for free you can get
you know go out there and buy from

692
00:33:28,749 --> 00:33:34,429
the law ought to combine openbsd you
can't download versions of b_s_t_

693
00:33:34,429 --> 00:33:38,049
if you wanna learn about computers what
better computer learn about

694
00:33:38,049 --> 00:33:40,580
the one that you don't have to worry
that they're finding out that you're

695
00:33:40,580 --> 00:33:41,650
there

696
00:33:41,650 --> 00:33:45,860
so again all this is widely and freely
available for you to learn about

697
00:33:45,860 --> 00:33:48,780
computers it that's our goal next

698
00:33:48,780 --> 00:33:52,530
find an install needed patches in other
words after you've gone ahead and

699
00:33:52,530 --> 00:33:56,299
install limits r_n_c_ or whatever

700
00:33:56,299 --> 00:34:00,629
go ahead and fix it so it's a secure
system one point for yes

701
00:34:00,630 --> 00:34:04,090
and for the most part for those of you
that don't realize this it's much harder

702
00:34:04,090 --> 00:34:07,529
to protect the system than it is to
attack it

703
00:34:07,529 --> 00:34:11,409
and i ever find that out

704
00:34:11,409 --> 00:34:12,709
very good

705
00:34:12,708 --> 00:34:13,908
so anyway

706
00:34:13,909 --> 00:34:17,369
you have to go ahead and finding install
the need to patches in this shows you

707
00:34:17,369 --> 00:34:18,259
really

708
00:34:18,259 --> 00:34:19,980
at least are trying to learn

709
00:34:19,980 --> 00:34:23,219
how to protect the computer and besides
that i'll get that

710
00:34:23,220 --> 00:34:24,609
returned to you

711
00:34:24,609 --> 00:34:28,998
besides that it's a marketable skill
that you claim to be trying to learn

712
00:34:28,999 --> 00:34:31,859
okay next network multiple systems

713
00:34:31,859 --> 00:34:34,259
one point for gas

714
00:34:34,259 --> 00:34:37,109
and again apply what you should be
learned let me go back i should explain

715
00:34:37,109 --> 00:34:38,489
that slightly more

716
00:34:38,490 --> 00:34:42,550
why me by networking multiple systems is
that you actually go ahead you have your

717
00:34:42,550 --> 00:34:43,480
box

718
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:46,179
you might buy another box of five
hundred dollars

719
00:34:46,179 --> 00:34:49,340
or borrowed your friends box tell your
friends who bring it over

720
00:34:49,340 --> 00:34:52,099
or maybe you can connect over the
internet via modems

721
00:34:52,099 --> 00:34:57,809
and try to get them working sharing
files and all that sort of stuff

722
00:34:57,809 --> 00:35:00,419
well that you hit the returned i think
this is there

723
00:35:00,419 --> 00:35:04,419
and again it's learning tool it's also
protect the network next

724
00:35:04,419 --> 00:35:09,229
and it's also uh... it's also a very
profitable skill to have

725
00:35:09,229 --> 00:35:11,469
next

726
00:35:11,469 --> 00:35:16,569
can you get shared printers working on
the network

727
00:35:16,569 --> 00:35:18,909
one point three s

728
00:35:18,909 --> 00:35:21,150
if you've ever had been a stereo system

729
00:35:21,150 --> 00:35:24,629
if you've ever administered a system
you'll know why this is important

730
00:35:24,629 --> 00:35:25,700
let me tell you

731
00:35:25,700 --> 00:35:29,740
i've had praised talking to apple's
talking to little windy windows three

732
00:35:29,740 --> 00:35:31,519
one one boxes

733
00:35:31,519 --> 00:35:36,259
and damn it if you ever get though those
printers working together properly

734
00:35:36,259 --> 00:35:39,639
you know printers will be your biggest
downfall next

735
00:35:39,639 --> 00:35:43,719
have you ever maintained a multi
platform network

736
00:35:43,719 --> 00:35:46,159
one point for yes

737
00:35:46,159 --> 00:35:51,599
and if you know what multi platform
means i'll give you a half-point

738
00:35:51,599 --> 00:35:54,889
how many people know what that means

739
00:35:54,889 --> 00:35:56,119
it's a start

740
00:35:56,119 --> 00:35:57,820
multi platform means

741
00:35:57,820 --> 00:36:02,479
that you're running multiple operating
systems on a single network

742
00:36:02,479 --> 00:36:06,289
have you ever stolen a telephone handset
because you think that makes you a freak

743
00:36:06,289 --> 00:36:08,399
or

744
00:36:08,399 --> 00:36:10,499
you'd be surprised

745
00:36:10,499 --> 00:36:17,199
subtract five points trieste

746
00:36:17,199 --> 00:36:20,809
you know a lot of people think this is
funny but i mean honestly it should've

747
00:36:20,809 --> 00:36:23,819
been likes attract fifteen or something

748
00:36:23,819 --> 00:36:27,489
you know i mean israeli looks funny but
you know for some reason everybody was

749
00:36:27,489 --> 00:36:31,190
out of death con likey not this year but
last year

750
00:36:31,190 --> 00:36:34,799
and all the telephone handsets at the
monte carlo were missing

751
00:36:34,799 --> 00:36:37,399
that really makes you hackers look very
good

752
00:36:37,399 --> 00:36:41,729
and for some reason i really wonder why
you think petty theft makes you a hacker

753
00:36:41,729 --> 00:36:43,510
or as part of hacker culture

754
00:36:43,510 --> 00:36:47,149
now just a thought to think about

755
00:36:47,149 --> 00:36:51,179
have you ever intentionally change the
computer system you have to work damage

756
00:36:51,179 --> 00:36:52,200
the system

757
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:54,199
actually that he had damaged

758
00:36:54,199 --> 00:36:57,209
don't even bother telling your story

759
00:36:57,209 --> 00:36:58,299
you know again

760
00:36:58,299 --> 00:36:59,229
remember

761
00:36:59,229 --> 00:37:04,839
you're out there to learn they're not
out there it was mine

762
00:37:04,839 --> 00:37:06,609
let's total this up

763
00:37:06,609 --> 00:37:09,659
seven to ten you're probably not
clueless

764
00:37:09,659 --> 00:37:12,539
five or six you're off to a good start

765
00:37:12,539 --> 00:37:15,299
there are four you're definitely
clewiston yes for those people have

766
00:37:15,299 --> 00:37:18,299
stolen telephone handsets

767
00:37:18,299 --> 00:37:22,229
keep a low profile

768
00:37:22,229 --> 00:37:25,710
okay let me stop and talk a word about
software testing 'cause now it's time

769
00:37:25,710 --> 00:37:27,959
now marketable skills there

770
00:37:27,959 --> 00:37:31,379
you know everybody thing software
testing is kind of like a very low tech

771
00:37:31,380 --> 00:37:32,470
thing to do

772
00:37:32,470 --> 00:37:35,470
is the job you get when you really suck
at everything else

773
00:37:35,470 --> 00:37:36,680
well let me tell you

774
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:39,259
what do you think that loft is doing

775
00:37:39,259 --> 00:37:42,390
they're out there finding problems as
software they're out there were looking

776
00:37:42,390 --> 00:37:43,580
at the internals

777
00:37:43,580 --> 00:37:46,170
and to me i don't know why they doing
this

778
00:37:46,170 --> 00:37:49,650
but essentially they're doing beta
testing from microsoft in my opinion for

779
00:37:49,650 --> 00:37:50,829
free

780
00:37:50,829 --> 00:37:54,059
you know i think they've gotta figure
out way to get paid for but that's their

781
00:37:54,059 --> 00:37:55,829
business not mine

782
00:37:55,829 --> 00:37:59,819
but anyway this is really though how you
learn about a computer system if you are

783
00:37:59,819 --> 00:38:01,110
interested in hacking

784
00:38:01,110 --> 00:38:05,150
hacking chichi you if you're doing to
legally should be nothing more then

785
00:38:05,150 --> 00:38:06,620
software testing

786
00:38:06,620 --> 00:38:08,520
you want to beat the system to death

787
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:12,129
and find out what the problem is how the
system to work in all that

788
00:38:12,129 --> 00:38:18,239
and decide that you know some people do
pay a lot for people doing that to them

789
00:38:18,239 --> 00:38:20,180
okay this is a big thing

790
00:38:20,180 --> 00:38:22,890
computers were not developed for your
enjoyment

791
00:38:22,890 --> 00:38:24,779
nobody develop sendmail

792
00:38:24,780 --> 00:38:27,979
so that you have something to do on a
dark evening

793
00:38:27,979 --> 00:38:32,189
sendmail is there for a purpose

794
00:38:32,189 --> 00:38:36,328
the only reasons computers exist is
because they serve a business purposes

795
00:38:36,329 --> 00:38:38,000
is what people don't realize

796
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:42,119
when i was up on a on the pact on the
penetration testing panel

797
00:38:42,119 --> 00:38:43,430
you know we were talking about

798
00:38:43,430 --> 00:38:46,308
if you just back into a computer system
proves nothing

799
00:38:46,309 --> 00:38:49,930
but when you hand the c_e_o_ their it
basically you hand the c_e_o_ their

800
00:38:49,930 --> 00:38:51,180
company's ads

801
00:38:51,180 --> 00:38:52,710
that gets their attention

802
00:38:52,710 --> 00:38:55,740
wide because computers are a tool that
doesn't matter

803
00:38:55,740 --> 00:39:00,279
if you break into a computer matters
what you do with an after you break in

804
00:39:00,279 --> 00:39:01,069
and again

805
00:39:01,069 --> 00:39:02,630
if you have a computer

806
00:39:02,630 --> 00:39:05,970
it does america to that you have a
computer singer matters what do you deal

807
00:39:05,970 --> 00:39:08,809
with it at home

808
00:39:08,809 --> 00:39:09,720
and again

809
00:39:09,720 --> 00:39:13,289
college helps you understand this next
wek

810
00:39:13,289 --> 00:39:16,940
and i want to make any comments on the
last thing if you want to be stupid

811
00:39:16,940 --> 00:39:19,700
that's your thing if you don't want to
degrade

812
00:39:19,700 --> 00:39:23,400
and you want to get paid him get stuffed
into a system administrator career path

813
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:24,440
for your whole life

814
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:28,599
that's your privilege not mine

815
00:39:28,599 --> 00:39:31,949
and the big thing why i think the
college to get education is a little bit

816
00:39:31,949 --> 00:39:32,859
more important

817
00:39:32,859 --> 00:39:34,890
and actually this is more for anything
else

818
00:39:34,890 --> 00:39:38,999
if you can write or you can communicate
your really doesn't make it dan

819
00:39:38,999 --> 00:39:42,489
if the people of the loft went out and
just found a bunch of software bugs and

820
00:39:42,489 --> 00:39:43,959
intel and by about it

821
00:39:43,959 --> 00:39:45,379
could and explain that

822
00:39:45,380 --> 00:39:48,380
and in endless like fashion that people
would you know that people can

823
00:39:48,380 --> 00:39:51,040
understand it would be totally useless

824
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:54,690
and any practice you get writing or
talking or whatever

825
00:39:54,690 --> 00:39:56,760
helps you be more effective

826
00:39:56,760 --> 00:39:58,020
at doing things

827
00:39:58,020 --> 00:40:00,960
again it helps you out there it helps
you communicate better

828
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:02,470
it helps you get paid more

829
00:40:02,470 --> 00:40:03,679
is i don't know yet

830
00:40:03,679 --> 00:40:06,889
you know i'm not there are a lot of
people much more qualified than i am

831
00:40:06,889 --> 00:40:08,739
that do the job i do

832
00:40:08,739 --> 00:40:11,440
the thing is i can express my opinions
better

833
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:13,780
and i can also expressed to management

834
00:40:13,780 --> 00:40:18,240
what the implications are communications
make sure that much more elite if you

835
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:21,419
want to call it that

836
00:40:21,419 --> 00:40:26,629
okay so if you're not trying to learn
about them pewter system star head

837
00:40:26,629 --> 00:40:29,139
don't call yourself a hacker

838
00:40:29,139 --> 00:40:31,969
you know if you're not out there trying
to learn about the internals if you're

839
00:40:31,969 --> 00:40:33,830
not out there trying to go ahead

840
00:40:33,830 --> 00:40:38,090
and find out the problems find out how
to improve your own computer systems

841
00:40:38,090 --> 00:40:39,989
don't call yourself a hacker

842
00:40:39,989 --> 00:40:42,579
call yourself what you are which is

843
00:40:42,579 --> 00:40:43,619
avoid are

844
00:40:43,619 --> 00:40:45,230
iconic don't like that thing

845
00:40:45,230 --> 00:40:48,879
and it kind of you know it's a little
bit more cd they need is our but

846
00:40:48,879 --> 00:40:50,279
on next

847
00:40:50,279 --> 00:40:52,369
pull yourself again pta

848
00:40:52,369 --> 00:40:55,589
you know i'm not here high grew up in
brooklyn new york

849
00:40:55,589 --> 00:40:58,319
for everybody is out there in the
apartment building in all these all

850
00:40:58,319 --> 00:40:59,069
ladies

851
00:40:59,069 --> 00:41:01,000
who don't have a life for their own

852
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,790
try to make a life of their own by
talking about what other people are

853
00:41:03,790 --> 00:41:04,569
doing

854
00:41:04,569 --> 00:41:06,500
why ask hackers what they're doing is
like

855
00:41:06,500 --> 00:41:10,059
are we just want to learn the
information that's being kept from us

856
00:41:10,059 --> 00:41:13,190
it's like well first of all before you
want to learn the information about me

857
00:41:13,190 --> 00:41:14,309
for example

858
00:41:14,309 --> 00:41:18,030
tell me everything about yourself tell
me everything about your family

859
00:41:18,030 --> 00:41:21,000
tell me was the last time you went to
the bathroom tell me every all your

860
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:21,609
money

861
00:41:21,609 --> 00:41:24,808
tell me where you can keep it tell me
everything about your life

862
00:41:24,809 --> 00:41:27,029
they don't want to do that for some
reason

863
00:41:27,029 --> 00:41:30,029
but the yet they want to know the same
thing about all of you as long as it's

864
00:41:30,029 --> 00:41:31,439
not them

865
00:41:31,439 --> 00:41:34,770
you know there's some little dollar you
know irony about this

866
00:41:34,770 --> 00:41:37,390
and i gotto admit uh... you know a
little bit is a bit of this is

867
00:41:37,390 --> 00:41:38,490
hypocritical

868
00:41:38,490 --> 00:41:41,800
night meyer manual goldstein in some
ways but for example

869
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:43,480
he was on a t_v_ show

870
00:41:43,480 --> 00:41:45,440
or actually was on his radio show once

871
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:49,210
where he was saying how he doesn't want
anybody to know for example that he

872
00:41:49,210 --> 00:41:51,589
brought this case of beer because he was
upset

873
00:41:51,589 --> 00:41:52,910
that he went into a store

874
00:41:52,910 --> 00:41:56,279
and he took down some information about
when he bought the bear

875
00:41:56,279 --> 00:41:59,650
and what happened was you know nobody
wants that nobody wants a might have a

876
00:41:59,650 --> 00:42:00,719
record of that

877
00:42:00,719 --> 00:42:04,339
not just with now because you're bashing
for beer because it's not of a buy stock

878
00:42:04,339 --> 00:42:07,189
in business

879
00:42:07,189 --> 00:42:10,509
if it's on a computer system all of you
wanna learn about it as long as dot

880
00:42:10,509 --> 00:42:12,069
about you

881
00:42:12,069 --> 00:42:13,140
and for some reason

882
00:42:13,140 --> 00:42:14,970
everybody can understand that

883
00:42:14,970 --> 00:42:16,809
nice but i think that's stupid

884
00:42:16,809 --> 00:42:17,630
sedi way

885
00:42:17,630 --> 00:42:20,749
if you don't like the word ghanta 'cause
it does it you know it's not high-tech

886
00:42:20,749 --> 00:42:22,519
enough for you go ahead

887
00:42:22,519 --> 00:42:26,749
call yourself a digital yen tha

888
00:42:26,749 --> 00:42:28,500
that's really what you are

889
00:42:28,500 --> 00:42:31,480
if you don't have a life of your own e
just try to break into computers to

890
00:42:31,480 --> 00:42:33,500
learn about all this hit in information

891
00:42:33,500 --> 00:42:37,699
your digital yanked out

892
00:42:37,699 --> 00:42:40,500
just remember this is game back more
into the criminal stuff

893
00:42:40,500 --> 00:42:43,219
good doing talk a little bit more about
that

894
00:42:43,219 --> 00:42:46,270
you're helping the criminals no matter
what your intentions

895
00:42:46,270 --> 00:42:49,819
again most people think it's a good
thing to exchange information

896
00:42:49,819 --> 00:42:54,660
again the loft is out there they realize
their tools are being used by criminals

897
00:42:54,660 --> 00:42:55,399
and again

898
00:42:55,400 --> 00:42:57,219
that's part of what they're doing

899
00:42:57,219 --> 00:43:00,499
uh... and they've realized that again
you know thought is if companies were

900
00:43:00,499 --> 00:43:02,300
protecting themselves well enough

901
00:43:02,300 --> 00:43:03,779
it wouldn't matter

902
00:43:03,779 --> 00:43:06,940
and again to a certain extent i have to
agree to that the promise of criminals

903
00:43:06,940 --> 00:43:08,899
are still out there exploiting it

904
00:43:08,899 --> 00:43:12,578
um... the big thing though is again this
happens on a regular basis cuz i mean

905
00:43:12,579 --> 00:43:13,349
tell you

906
00:43:13,349 --> 00:43:15,800
the criminals of foreign intelligence
agencies

907
00:43:15,800 --> 00:43:19,030
every attack we've seen have been
straightforward attacks and then there

908
00:43:19,030 --> 00:43:22,739
was a comments on mine eight all that's
just the ones are attaching

909
00:43:22,739 --> 00:43:26,619
when we go ahead and put his line
stiffer where we see every dot gambit

910
00:43:26,619 --> 00:43:28,040
that goes across

911
00:43:28,040 --> 00:43:31,279
we can't tell which have which pacs are
being used

912
00:43:31,279 --> 00:43:35,040
lots of government agencies do all the
better government agencies do this

913
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:36,819
the better companies do this

914
00:43:36,819 --> 00:43:40,430
and again we're watching some new
attacks being developed and there are

915
00:43:40,430 --> 00:43:42,480
very very very few of them

916
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:46,909
there's like one new attack that we see
every other month that's not reported

917
00:43:46,909 --> 00:43:49,559
and again these are problems if you
think all it's out there on the leading

918
00:43:49,559 --> 00:43:51,150
edge it's like no it's not

919
00:43:51,150 --> 00:43:55,280
most of it is just send mail a hundred
fifty times you'd be surprised how many

920
00:43:55,280 --> 00:43:58,999
people actually think that still good

921
00:43:58,999 --> 00:44:02,950
now calling it now let's talk about this
for a while let's say you still think

922
00:44:02,950 --> 00:44:04,280
that its right to have

923
00:44:04,280 --> 00:44:06,860
which you probably do i'm not here to
change invites mine

924
00:44:06,860 --> 00:44:08,959
i'm here to open up to rise a little bit

925
00:44:08,959 --> 00:44:10,980
the laws are only going to get worse

926
00:44:10,980 --> 00:44:13,899
you know bard meets uh... idea i'm sorry
for him

927
00:44:13,899 --> 00:44:15,380
best arising his name

928
00:44:15,380 --> 00:44:18,970
but basically he was up there saying
you're all doing allows a p_r_ job

929
00:44:18,970 --> 00:44:21,890
and that's really true that you are
doing a lousy p_r_ job

930
00:44:21,890 --> 00:44:26,499
but personally i don't think it's going
to get any better the world is out there

931
00:44:26,499 --> 00:44:28,840
computers are becoming more more
connected

932
00:44:28,840 --> 00:44:32,840
everybody has more more information on a
computer and i don't think people are

933
00:44:32,840 --> 00:44:34,120
just in a welcome

934
00:44:34,120 --> 00:44:36,120
hackers randomly choosing

935
00:44:36,120 --> 00:44:38,699
which computers i got a break into

936
00:44:38,699 --> 00:44:42,279
i don't think i want that idon't think
do you want somebody randomly choosing

937
00:44:42,279 --> 00:44:46,609
to break into your computer breaking
into your credit record or whatever

938
00:44:46,609 --> 00:44:51,489
you know so laws are only going to get
worse

939
00:44:51,489 --> 00:44:54,500
and as other hackers will tell you and
this is the more important thing

940
00:44:54,500 --> 00:44:57,500
everybody's out there is like but i'm
hacking and that's the right thing to do

941
00:44:57,500 --> 00:44:58,180
it's like

942
00:44:58,180 --> 00:45:00,538
well no again to quote the room

943
00:45:00,539 --> 00:45:02,289
began to quote the initial speaker

944
00:45:02,289 --> 00:45:04,949
what part of jail don't you understand

945
00:45:04,949 --> 00:45:07,709
they really want to put people in jail

946
00:45:07,709 --> 00:45:10,989
you know again prob that's what cops do
i mean people like to sail cops really

947
00:45:10,989 --> 00:45:13,490
out there for the hackers note they
really

948
00:45:13,490 --> 00:45:15,470
go with the gusto for anybody

949
00:45:15,470 --> 00:45:17,249
they're trying to prosecute

950
00:45:17,249 --> 00:45:18,179
and again

951
00:45:18,179 --> 00:45:21,819
if you know it's a crime andy and let's
face it let's say you think they're

952
00:45:21,819 --> 00:45:23,390
really out to screw you

953
00:45:23,390 --> 00:45:25,879
if you think they're really out to screw
you

954
00:45:25,880 --> 00:45:29,230
and you do something that's criminal and
might attract their attention

955
00:45:29,230 --> 00:45:33,290
you gotta expect that when they catch if
they catch you doing something criminal

956
00:45:33,290 --> 00:45:35,329
they're gonna really screw you

957
00:45:35,329 --> 00:45:39,659
accept that as a fact

958
00:45:39,659 --> 00:45:42,700
you know if he ever watch for red and
most you probably haven't but

959
00:45:42,700 --> 00:45:45,359
don't do the crime if you can't do the
time

960
00:45:45,359 --> 00:45:46,359
because again

961
00:45:46,359 --> 00:45:48,058
your out there helping people

962
00:45:48,059 --> 00:45:51,199
and again i want to keep reiterating
that when i'm there investigating a

963
00:45:51,199 --> 00:45:52,079
crime

964
00:45:52,079 --> 00:45:54,390
i'm going to head investigate a real
crime

965
00:45:54,390 --> 00:45:58,029
i'm not out there to put like you know
your clueless teenagers in jail because

966
00:45:58,029 --> 00:45:59,810
it's not worth anybody's effort

967
00:45:59,810 --> 00:46:03,759
although i should say there was a
teenager huamn took down a website with

968
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:06,740
that on microsoft's website hack if you
remember that

969
00:46:06,740 --> 00:46:08,909
the one that took down the microsoft
site

970
00:46:08,909 --> 00:46:12,689
but what happened was somebody use that
against the commercial website and they

971
00:46:12,689 --> 00:46:17,519
had really good administrators how many
people know what they did

972
00:46:17,519 --> 00:46:20,629
i can't believe that yet well let me
tell you they bailed

973
00:46:20,629 --> 00:46:25,368
the part of the kids mother who did at
four thousand dollars for investigating

974
00:46:25,369 --> 00:46:27,309
and fixing the problem

975
00:46:27,309 --> 00:46:30,459
and again i'd like to see more that
there's a kind of puts on the effect

976
00:46:30,459 --> 00:46:32,089
whose again hacking

977
00:46:32,089 --> 00:46:36,769
itself if it's investigated properly
cost people money just to investigate

978
00:46:36,769 --> 00:46:39,140
and again more importantly for my
purposes

979
00:46:39,140 --> 00:46:41,890
i really don't want to waste my time
with you and i said earlier that you're

980
00:46:41,890 --> 00:46:44,770
really all just pains in the ass we're
breaking into systems

981
00:46:44,770 --> 00:46:47,800
that's really all you are i don't want
to bother with you i want to bother with

982
00:46:47,800 --> 00:46:48,880
the criminals cuz

983
00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:51,260
they're doing better things are more
interesting things

984
00:46:51,260 --> 00:46:54,859
it's more fun to investigate somebody
that's doing a million dollars

985
00:46:54,859 --> 00:46:57,440
and that's the really good stuff i don't
like to have to go up and do other

986
00:46:57,440 --> 00:46:59,240
things 'cause again

987
00:46:59,240 --> 00:47:03,439
you are giving them the tools and the
knowledge to attack the systems

988
00:47:03,439 --> 00:47:07,709
and that's where hackers and criminals
collide again i have everything you know

989
00:47:07,709 --> 00:47:10,029
again you're not just out there in a
bubble

990
00:47:10,029 --> 00:47:11,680
you're out there in the real world

991
00:47:11,680 --> 00:47:13,129
and let me tell you something

992
00:47:13,130 --> 00:47:16,400
if a by by chance happens to
accidentally take down how financial

993
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:17,659
system

994
00:47:17,659 --> 00:47:20,719
you think the government's going to come
after you well let's talk about this if

995
00:47:20,719 --> 00:47:23,429
you want to get really scare about
breaking into banks

996
00:47:23,429 --> 00:47:27,320
i don't know how many people realize
this but drug lawn ball money-laundering

997
00:47:27,320 --> 00:47:30,359
involves a stable financial system

998
00:47:30,359 --> 00:47:33,689
they like the banks up and running
caused billions of dollars are laundered

999
00:47:33,689 --> 00:47:35,029
it legally

1000
00:47:35,029 --> 00:47:36,219
a day

1001
00:47:36,219 --> 00:47:40,009
and that's kind of a large sum of money
now if you are the russian mafia where

1002
00:47:40,009 --> 00:47:44,010
you are a drug cartel wondering a few
million dollars a day individually

1003
00:47:44,010 --> 00:47:45,499
and some hacker

1004
00:47:45,499 --> 00:47:47,289
accidentally took down the system

1005
00:47:47,289 --> 00:47:48,809
you're going to tested on

1006
00:47:48,809 --> 00:47:52,849
aim i get away with the wants well that
hacker might get away with it once if it

1007
00:47:52,849 --> 00:47:54,550
happens a second time

1008
00:47:54,550 --> 00:47:56,380
they're not gonna wait for a third time

1009
00:47:56,380 --> 00:47:58,049
they will will come after you

1010
00:47:58,049 --> 00:48:01,469
to make sure that their money laundering
will go on

1011
00:48:01,469 --> 00:48:04,439
and again just think that what they do
to like you know a little drug dealers

1012
00:48:04,439 --> 00:48:06,118
that steal money from them

1013
00:48:06,119 --> 00:48:10,280
little drug dealers and steal money from
them they come after they say this first

1014
00:48:10,280 --> 00:48:12,660
time we will forgive you for being
stupid

1015
00:48:12,660 --> 00:48:14,328
give us back the money

1016
00:48:14,329 --> 00:48:17,799
what happens away people turn themselves
that is they've already spent the money

1017
00:48:17,799 --> 00:48:19,559
bagel run into the police

1018
00:48:19,559 --> 00:48:22,069
but usually they sify in some way to get
the money back

1019
00:48:22,069 --> 00:48:25,299
if they steal money from the drug
cartels the second time they're really

1020
00:48:25,299 --> 00:48:26,180
in trouble

1021
00:48:26,180 --> 00:48:28,940
same thing if u scrub some sort of drug
deal

1022
00:48:28,940 --> 00:48:31,719
for some crime or some organized crime
thing

1023
00:48:31,719 --> 00:48:34,410
they will come after you when you do it
the second time please

1024
00:48:34,410 --> 00:48:36,799
they don't like things happening to
third time

1025
00:48:36,799 --> 00:48:39,259
and again you can uh...

1026
00:48:39,259 --> 00:48:42,970
you can actually read the newspapers on
this this is my source for one of them

1027
00:48:42,970 --> 00:48:43,949
where some

1028
00:48:43,949 --> 00:48:46,899
people were let's just say stacked

1029
00:48:46,899 --> 00:48:48,569
did some nasty things for

1030
00:48:48,569 --> 00:48:50,270
a criminal organization

1031
00:48:50,270 --> 00:48:51,170
and they did

1032
00:48:51,170 --> 00:48:54,500
some nasty things against the criminal
organization and they did come after

1033
00:48:54,500 --> 00:48:55,269
them

1034
00:48:55,269 --> 00:48:58,929
uh... that's about it i'm kinda rare
renting right now but

1035
00:48:58,929 --> 00:49:00,450
unless it quick question

1036
00:49:00,450 --> 00:49:01,470
how many people

1037
00:49:01,470 --> 00:49:05,249
score between seven and ten

1038
00:49:05,249 --> 00:49:06,299
yeah you

1039
00:49:06,299 --> 00:49:07,200
max

1040
00:49:07,200 --> 00:49:10,029
five to six

1041
00:49:10,029 --> 00:49:13,650
okay how many people are totally
clueless

1042
00:49:13,650 --> 00:49:16,579
yanked for people that i actually
admitted

1043
00:49:16,579 --> 00:49:18,619
but maybe this gives you a little bit of
guidance

1044
00:49:18,619 --> 00:49:21,670
on what you should be doing if you
really claim to be a hacker

1045
00:49:21,670 --> 00:49:23,619
versus being a digital yen tha

1046
00:49:23,619 --> 00:49:24,529
same way

1047
00:49:24,529 --> 00:49:26,639
uh... if there's nothing else

1048
00:49:26,639 --> 00:49:32,859
i will take questions if you have any

1049
00:49:32,859 --> 00:49:35,249
all sorry

1050
00:49:35,249 --> 00:49:39,699
corporate espionage twenty six dollars
almighty it was a recommended book at

1051
00:49:39,699 --> 00:49:44,319
amazon dot com in june and they were
cited for forty percent off

1052
00:49:44,319 --> 00:49:47,879
you might get it for like thirty percent
off now an amazon dot com

1053
00:49:47,879 --> 00:49:50,379
yet give your credit card over the
internet right on that network there

1054
00:49:50,379 --> 00:49:52,929
they'll be smart but anyway on

1055
00:49:52,929 --> 00:49:59,929
let's available barnes and noble and
better bookstores everywhere

1056
00:50:01,469 --> 00:50:07,579
all good

1057
00:50:07,579 --> 00:50:11,049
you know it's years you're seeing here
that dinner shouldn't have anything like

1058
00:50:11,049 --> 00:50:15,079
that and just you know myself before the
devils their system that you assume the

1059
00:50:15,079 --> 00:50:16,629
fix themselves

1060
00:50:16,629 --> 00:50:20,199
this is like uh... law office and they
know they have for microsoft all about

1061
00:50:20,199 --> 00:50:23,699
problems they have they don't believe
them

1062
00:50:23,699 --> 00:50:25,579
really the only way to get anyone to
burn

1063
00:50:25,579 --> 00:50:28,569
view that they have holes in their
systems the only way to anyone will be

1064
00:50:28,569 --> 00:50:33,019
safe as if you go ahead and take it in
your own hands and do the job now

1065
00:50:33,019 --> 00:50:35,919
so it's pet owner cn you know you're
kind of

1066
00:50:35,919 --> 00:50:38,879
almost contradicting yourself

1067
00:50:38,879 --> 00:50:42,519
basically what you're saying is

1068
00:50:42,519 --> 00:50:45,699
basically if i'm correct what you're
saying is that

1069
00:50:45,699 --> 00:50:46,559
it's

1070
00:50:46,559 --> 00:50:49,510
you know you are proving a point to
accompanied

1071
00:50:49,510 --> 00:50:51,359
europe using a company

1072
00:50:51,359 --> 00:50:53,270
to find a home with their system

1073
00:50:53,270 --> 00:50:56,740
i'm not saying that it's right that
microsoft close off lost problem you

1074
00:50:56,740 --> 00:50:58,110
know close off the proms law

1075
00:50:58,110 --> 00:50:59,539
what bob

1076
00:50:59,539 --> 00:51:01,179
what i'm saying is

1077
00:51:01,179 --> 00:51:02,750
and i really don't care

1078
00:51:02,750 --> 00:51:05,210
what goes on but basically what i'm
saying is

1079
00:51:05,210 --> 00:51:06,929
is that if you choose

1080
00:51:06,929 --> 00:51:11,669
if you take it upon yourself to prove to
an individual company

1081
00:51:11,669 --> 00:51:15,408
they're using the microsoft product
which has problems with it

1082
00:51:15,409 --> 00:51:17,300
and you get into the company

1083
00:51:17,300 --> 00:51:19,759
and you commit a crime to prove it

1084
00:51:19,759 --> 00:51:22,400
i don't really give a damn what your
attitude is

1085
00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:27,010
it's not my position to do it basically
if the company decides to prosecute you

1086
00:51:27,010 --> 00:51:28,299
criminally

1087
00:51:28,299 --> 00:51:29,359
they can

1088
00:51:29,359 --> 00:51:32,089
that's their position that's all i'm
saying

1089
00:51:32,089 --> 00:51:35,619
i'm not saying it's right or wrong i'm
saying if you decide to choose to do

1090
00:51:35,619 --> 00:51:37,519
that you're committing a crime

1091
00:51:37,519 --> 00:51:38,140
an expat

1092
00:51:38,140 --> 00:51:42,779
to go repre questions and don't say for
me i couldn't expect this it's like now

1093
00:51:42,780 --> 00:51:45,869
you know they're gonna come after you in
space

1094
00:51:45,869 --> 00:51:46,740
can see that

1095
00:51:46,740 --> 00:51:53,389
you're referring to people like us as
you know a pain he has to you

1096
00:51:53,389 --> 00:51:56,949
years assuming that every corporation

1097
00:51:56,949 --> 00:51:59,449
as a network or has any type of

1098
00:51:59,449 --> 00:52:03,449
need for security is going to hire
people like you and spend the money for

1099
00:52:03,449 --> 00:52:04,319
it

1100
00:52:04,319 --> 00:52:08,159
and build is assume that they have told
c_n_n_ are not not not assuming that i

1101
00:52:08,159 --> 00:52:09,480
know most of them don't

1102
00:52:09,480 --> 00:52:11,880
are going to companies like five
millions of falls

1103
00:52:11,880 --> 00:52:13,849
i walk out there tom how to fix it

1104
00:52:13,849 --> 00:52:17,109
i can guarantee they're still millions
of polls a year later

1105
00:52:17,109 --> 00:52:18,720
i know that's not the case

1106
00:52:18,720 --> 00:52:22,769
what i basically saying is that if you
go ahead

1107
00:52:22,769 --> 00:52:24,899
hackett computer system

1108
00:52:24,899 --> 00:52:27,049
to prove that there is a problem

1109
00:52:27,049 --> 00:52:30,399
to the company you're committing a crime

1110
00:52:30,399 --> 00:52:33,560
the repertoire since from that i'm not
saying it's right or wrong

1111
00:52:33,560 --> 00:52:37,250
i'm not saying companies are smart but
the promise when hackers break-in and

1112
00:52:37,250 --> 00:52:38,109
i'd always

1113
00:52:38,109 --> 00:52:40,119
this is the point l always comes back to
you

1114
00:52:40,119 --> 00:52:40,770
when hackers

1115
00:52:40,770 --> 00:52:42,470
break into a computer system

1116
00:52:42,470 --> 00:52:43,770
if you want to do good

1117
00:52:43,770 --> 00:52:47,810
but the system administrator no the
promise hackers that are out there

1118
00:52:47,810 --> 00:52:49,210
breaking into the computers

1119
00:52:49,210 --> 00:52:52,030
they don't want to do the right thing
and let the sysadmin so maybe about two

1120
00:52:52,030 --> 00:52:55,850
or three people i've actually heard of
actually have actually done that most of

1121
00:52:55,850 --> 00:52:58,319
the side of the place the policy
information

1122
00:52:58,319 --> 00:53:00,419
is on some bulletin board or some

1123
00:53:00,419 --> 00:53:01,470
a website

1124
00:53:01,470 --> 00:53:04,470
to prove they relieved they're more
interested in proving their elite

1125
00:53:04,470 --> 00:53:07,460
than doing what you are saying is the
noble thing which could be the noble

1126
00:53:07,460 --> 00:53:14,460
thing to prove their is prompted helped
the company fix it

1127
00:53:15,949 --> 00:53:17,749
yeah i i i wanted to do

1128
00:53:17,749 --> 00:53:20,659
to make the

1129
00:53:20,659 --> 00:53:21,940
of

1130
00:53:21,940 --> 00:53:24,069
your industry's roland

1131
00:53:24,069 --> 00:53:29,099
leslie the halls that are smiling all
people because a lot of obama understand

1132
00:53:29,099 --> 00:53:30,489
how quickly

1133
00:53:30,489 --> 00:53:32,269
they're beautiful

1134
00:53:32,269 --> 00:53:33,499
yes sir

1135
00:53:33,499 --> 00:53:36,849
i say this there are a lot of companies
that have a bunch of really good system

1136
00:53:36,849 --> 00:53:40,119
in ministry here's again if you go to
lisa conference

1137
00:53:40,119 --> 00:53:42,490
there's thousands of people going there

1138
00:53:42,490 --> 00:53:45,799
these are people that are actually
learning how to do things right

1139
00:53:45,799 --> 00:53:47,589
and that's just internally

1140
00:53:47,589 --> 00:53:51,569
farther as far as business goes and
since that response businesses

1141
00:53:51,569 --> 00:53:54,400
you have companies like i_b_m_ essay i
see

1142
00:53:54,400 --> 00:53:57,540
and a bunch of other consulting
companies are doing in service ponds

1143
00:53:57,540 --> 00:54:00,839
you got the real group which is out
there bringing uh... 'em detection

1144
00:54:00,839 --> 00:54:02,049
systems there

1145
00:54:02,049 --> 00:54:05,390
and again people are getting better like
i gave the example before

1146
00:54:05,390 --> 00:54:07,020
the candidates mother

1147
00:54:07,020 --> 00:54:10,509
even better than the kid was sent a bill
for four thousand dollars

1148
00:54:10,510 --> 00:54:13,589
there are a lot more packers in jail
than you do know about

1149
00:54:13,589 --> 00:54:15,220
every time i could for example

1150
00:54:15,220 --> 00:54:17,749
inc magazine excerpted my book

1151
00:54:17,749 --> 00:54:20,950
i got three letters from people in
prison

1152
00:54:20,950 --> 00:54:22,049
saying

1153
00:54:22,049 --> 00:54:24,619
all i'd love to work for you

1154
00:54:24,619 --> 00:54:26,319
you know again that's just the thing

1155
00:54:26,319 --> 00:54:29,000
all on one of the better hackers will
ever find

1156
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:32,820
it's hard to find a social engineer
better than me you know being the hacker

1157
00:54:32,820 --> 00:54:34,489
michael you should read my book

1158
00:54:34,489 --> 00:54:35,279
but anyway

1159
00:54:35,279 --> 00:54:39,059
that's you know there a lot of people in
jail it's not going to be a shrinking

1160
00:54:39,059 --> 00:54:40,349
phenomenon

1161
00:54:40,349 --> 00:54:42,359
f_b_i_ computers crimes flight

1162
00:54:42,359 --> 00:54:46,919
is supposed to grow to seventy-five
agents just at the central location

1163
00:54:46,919 --> 00:54:48,489
when right now they're used to be

1164
00:54:48,489 --> 00:54:50,319
i think it was fifteen

1165
00:54:50,319 --> 00:54:54,719
so it's growing by over five times and
there are getting better train bynoe

1166
00:54:54,719 --> 00:54:57,199
they want me to help train but that's a
separate issue

1167
00:54:57,199 --> 00:54:59,160
sorry pat

1168
00:54:59,160 --> 00:55:01,558
getting back to your circles

1169
00:55:01,559 --> 00:55:02,809
uh...

1170
00:55:02,809 --> 00:55:06,469
what do you think the people in the
inner circle started circle lines

1171
00:55:06,469 --> 00:55:10,029
you think that they started in the outer
local doubled up

1172
00:55:10,029 --> 00:55:12,859
without a cell like this is hope for the
enters a

1173
00:55:12,859 --> 00:55:15,859
now there is hope for the united states
they do decide they don't want to be

1174
00:55:15,859 --> 00:55:16,730
getting his

1175
00:55:16,730 --> 00:55:19,929
the problem is they're not interested in
going out there and learning

1176
00:55:19,929 --> 00:55:24,249
books out there damn good books when the
people started they had to go into

1177
00:55:24,249 --> 00:55:27,160
almost elite status because of the
nineteen eighties

1178
00:55:27,160 --> 00:55:29,999
there were no computers computers were
expensive

1179
00:55:29,999 --> 00:55:33,119
these days you can buy a used to be a
cycle but i don't want to buy a four

1180
00:55:33,119 --> 00:55:34,029
eighty six

1181
00:55:34,029 --> 00:55:37,050
but yes you can buy a four eight-six for
two hundred dollars

1182
00:55:37,050 --> 00:55:41,880
and run limits on it and again the
people originally like the law

1183
00:55:41,880 --> 00:55:44,910
they started out wanting to learn about
computers and they might have had to

1184
00:55:44,910 --> 00:55:46,020
break into learn

1185
00:55:46,020 --> 00:55:48,940
but that's a separate issue right now if
you think to some of the people in the

1186
00:55:48,940 --> 00:55:52,089
inner circle actually started on the
other hand then moved in i mean it seems

1187
00:55:52,089 --> 00:55:52,769
like

1188
00:55:52,769 --> 00:55:55,279
yes i mean everybody has to start the
outer

1189
00:55:55,279 --> 00:55:58,480
i mean i put dennis based on your
intentions with liam will benefit

1190
00:55:58,480 --> 00:56:02,030
it's based on intentions if you want to
learn about them uterus you will get

1191
00:56:02,030 --> 00:56:03,440
into the inner circle

1192
00:56:03,440 --> 00:56:05,479
just as you want to persevere

1193
00:56:05,479 --> 00:56:08,750
and again you have to one of her sit
there and learning about computers

1194
00:56:08,750 --> 00:56:12,129
now learning about other people's
business yeah

1195
00:56:12,129 --> 00:56:13,909
you said earlier that

1196
00:56:13,909 --> 00:56:14,830
the problem you have

1197
00:56:14,830 --> 00:56:17,610
when people break into a system is when
they start committing crimes in the

1198
00:56:17,610 --> 00:56:18,469
system

1199
00:56:18,469 --> 00:56:22,089
uh... but now isn't technically just
breaking into the future of crime

1200
00:56:22,089 --> 00:56:25,029
yes on let me say so then how are we
supposed to

1201
00:56:25,030 --> 00:56:26,429
inform anyone

1202
00:56:26,429 --> 00:56:29,919
it just by breaking into the system
we're already were already criminal

1203
00:56:29,919 --> 00:56:31,950
and then by letting the people know

1204
00:56:31,950 --> 00:56:36,259
cm all foreign aid and assistance to
turn over the break into a system

1205
00:56:36,259 --> 00:56:37,739
because that's what she feels

1206
00:56:37,739 --> 00:56:40,410
but it was nothing gets all let me put
it this way i have

1207
00:56:40,410 --> 00:56:42,589
never heard of a by going to jail

1208
00:56:42,589 --> 00:56:45,519
by letting asus admin know that they
have a problem

1209
00:56:45,519 --> 00:56:48,659
and you just email route that system

1210
00:56:48,659 --> 00:56:52,579
or sysadmin or like mid postmaster
whatever

1211
00:56:52,579 --> 00:56:56,369
the only person that knows that they
have a whole at that point is the admin

1212
00:56:56,369 --> 00:56:59,319
if they're stupid enough to let a little
yet by the way left our computer system

1213
00:56:59,319 --> 00:57:00,749
wide open

1214
00:57:00,749 --> 00:57:03,429
nobody has got me that uh...

1215
00:57:03,429 --> 00:57:07,019
prosecute you because you're just
telling them they have a problem they

1216
00:57:07,019 --> 00:57:07,920
have to actually

1217
00:57:07,920 --> 00:57:11,899
prove that you were there in order to
prosecute you or do anything

1218
00:57:11,899 --> 00:57:14,848
but is it just feel that you sent them
to did you with their

1219
00:57:14,849 --> 00:57:18,659
now i just need to make their know you
could be totally wrong for the test i

1220
00:57:18,659 --> 00:57:21,210
don't mean that group dot the
administrator

1221
00:57:21,210 --> 00:57:22,890
okay because i've seen this a lot

1222
00:57:22,890 --> 00:57:28,169
i can't tell it isn't ministers you know
that they go to jail to get in trouble

1223
00:57:28,169 --> 00:57:31,949
you know institute the belief that the
cold on that subject it every night at

1224
00:57:31,949 --> 00:57:33,259
nine a

1225
00:57:33,259 --> 00:57:35,339
finance dot pano

1226
00:57:35,339 --> 00:57:37,819
kanata hetnet dot efy

1227
00:57:37,819 --> 00:57:40,069
that's a good way of doing it

1228
00:57:40,069 --> 00:57:42,479
wrote thanks alot

1229
00:57:42,479 --> 00:57:44,769
i thought they open back up

1230
00:57:44,769 --> 00:57:48,009
there's three dozen other and not a
lowest in the database was turned over

1231
00:57:48,009 --> 00:57:49,220
to the justice

1232
00:57:49,220 --> 00:57:50,509
object dot

1233
00:57:50,509 --> 00:57:57,029
so gulf using i mean there's dozens of
an honest three mailers

1234
00:57:57,029 --> 00:57:58,789
yet have itself

1235
00:57:58,789 --> 00:58:01,589
more of a state are hardly legislative

1236
00:58:01,589 --> 00:58:05,219
it's in the uh... the angle that you've
taken this kinda like a kind of person a

1237
00:58:05,219 --> 00:58:08,469
lot of people in the place but to me it
just seems that you need to take a

1238
00:58:08,469 --> 00:58:12,689
little bit more about you point between
our your your godliness and you know how

1239
00:58:12,689 --> 00:58:16,319
to work to stop and the average against
that doesn't know how the program is

1240
00:58:16,319 --> 00:58:20,179
p_c_r_ david that is another begin
therefore hacker to exist in between

1241
00:58:20,179 --> 00:58:22,999
those two points

1242
00:58:22,999 --> 00:58:26,109
i've i've probably sport like very alone
your testified

1243
00:58:26,109 --> 00:58:30,808
uh... it seems that attacker can exist

1244
00:58:30,809 --> 00:58:34,990
a new just a between those two point
noah hacker passes these days

1245
00:58:34,990 --> 00:58:37,400
because you can go ahead take college
courses

1246
00:58:37,400 --> 00:58:39,459
if you go ahead get a bunches

1247
00:58:39,459 --> 00:58:42,930
you can go ahead read books load your
own computer with an x

1248
00:58:42,930 --> 00:58:44,789
you can go ahead by

1249
00:58:44,789 --> 00:58:45,920
debt with friends

1250
00:58:45,920 --> 00:58:47,710
network the computers together

1251
00:58:47,710 --> 00:58:50,009
practice for the prompt likert like that

1252
00:58:50,009 --> 00:58:52,759
better people are doing right out there
today

1253
00:58:52,759 --> 00:58:54,180
they're going out there today

1254
00:58:54,180 --> 00:58:58,079
and practicing hacking into each other's
computer systems on their laptops

1255
00:58:58,079 --> 00:58:59,730
as you know you'd like i said out there

1256
00:58:59,730 --> 00:59:02,489
it's like you know the people doing the
passport sniffing

1257
00:59:02,489 --> 00:59:05,130
you know they're going to head on the
network where it's okay

1258
00:59:05,130 --> 00:59:08,220
and you can set up your own network
saying okay i know hackers

1259
00:59:08,220 --> 00:59:10,690
boots that i've been around you know
i've been arrested i don't want to deal

1260
00:59:10,690 --> 00:59:11,350
with this

1261
00:59:11,350 --> 00:59:13,150
and they go out and set up their
networks in the eighth

1262
00:59:13,150 --> 00:59:16,390
about what had been doesn't have to be
on unix and media

1263
00:59:16,390 --> 00:59:18,078
it's just

1264
00:59:18,079 --> 00:59:20,539
it just uh... i mean your probably

1265
00:59:20,539 --> 00:59:24,849
really really good at doing that and
really really good

1266
00:59:24,849 --> 00:59:28,670
on those was also a hesitancy while
they're about computers

1267
00:59:28,670 --> 00:59:32,640
you can take up graphics program you can
develop your own gains why bother paying

1268
00:59:32,640 --> 00:59:34,710
fifty dollars somebody else's game

1269
00:59:34,710 --> 00:59:35,970
and i think it's easy

1270
00:59:35,970 --> 00:59:36,869
that's the problem

1271
00:59:36,869 --> 00:59:39,520
it's really easy to just want to be a
digital yetta

1272
00:59:39,520 --> 00:59:41,850
the hard part is going on in michigan
there

1273
00:59:41,850 --> 00:59:43,560
to one of the earned about computers

1274
00:59:43,560 --> 00:59:47,560
and take the effort to read books to go
through installation manuals to get

1275
00:59:47,560 --> 00:59:48,690
openbsd

1276
00:59:48,690 --> 00:59:50,639
alone on the system sorry

1277
00:59:50,639 --> 00:59:55,869
pass that test

1278
00:59:55,869 --> 00:59:58,129
as some of those

1279
00:59:58,129 --> 00:59:59,749
built eleven as well

1280
00:59:59,749 --> 01:00:01,759
and written books

1281
01:00:01,759 --> 01:00:04,049
both of the consulting practice

1282
01:00:04,049 --> 01:00:09,038
you are right fucking

1283
01:00:09,039 --> 01:00:12,259
to people agree

1284
01:00:12,259 --> 01:00:15,029
i want to encourage everyone

1285
01:00:15,029 --> 01:00:18,669
jeppesen computers gets an ethernet
cards

1286
01:00:18,669 --> 01:00:21,979
stick it in your laundry room

1287
01:00:21,979 --> 01:00:23,299
loaded up

1288
01:00:23,299 --> 01:00:25,409
and look at it

1289
01:00:25,409 --> 01:00:28,760
the time that i started learning
operating systems with united

1290
01:00:28,760 --> 01:00:30,629
they got a question that night

1291
01:00:30,629 --> 01:00:31,670
and then go downstairs

1292
01:00:31,670 --> 01:00:34,759
airs in the middle of the night and try
it out

1293
01:00:34,759 --> 01:00:36,259
and then go back to bed

1294
01:00:36,259 --> 01:00:37,959
this is the way he won't work

1295
01:00:37,959 --> 01:00:41,839
and that's what he's talking about so by
some cheap computers

1296
01:00:41,839 --> 01:00:44,799
it doesn't have to be one x it doesn't
have to be your next week

1297
01:00:44,799 --> 01:00:46,160
you get a lot of the

1298
01:00:46,160 --> 01:00:49,839
consulting on into a problem

1299
01:00:49,839 --> 01:00:53,459
is anywhere from last year

1300
01:00:53,459 --> 01:00:56,599
actually haha just walked in

1301
01:00:56,599 --> 01:01:00,809
i know but certainly better than that

1302
01:01:00,809 --> 01:01:01,940
good question

1303
01:01:01,940 --> 01:01:07,059
when when you're when you're looking at
uh...

1304
01:01:07,059 --> 01:01:08,479
inefficiencies

1305
01:01:08,479 --> 01:01:10,339
in microsoft products

1306
01:01:10,339 --> 01:01:11,989
do you do it on

1307
01:01:11,989 --> 01:01:13,850
uh... corporate networks for two

1308
01:01:13,850 --> 01:01:18,959
you do it on your own network

1309
01:01:18,959 --> 01:01:21,949
what

1310
01:01:21,949 --> 01:01:23,159
alright anyway

1311
01:01:23,159 --> 01:01:24,469
anywhere

1312
01:01:24,469 --> 01:01:26,239
military prosecuted for it

1313
01:01:26,239 --> 01:01:32,399
break it into your own network that's
what i'm trying to say

1314
01:01:32,399 --> 01:01:37,138
and he's with swine six hundred magazine
in some ways to perform day

1315
01:01:37,139 --> 01:01:38,999
nevermind

1316
01:01:38,999 --> 01:01:41,799
of just just the volunteer

1317
01:01:41,799 --> 01:01:45,529
hiatus jayanti very well only if they
are all in a shortly

1318
01:01:45,529 --> 01:01:48,630
i'm just curious because i know that
parking where we have a

1319
01:01:48,630 --> 01:01:52,720
computer science department and we also
had a delicate and it's a constant

1320
01:01:52,720 --> 01:01:56,530
war going on because the main issue just
relaxed oh what goes on i'm just curious

1321
01:01:56,530 --> 01:01:58,029
how you would

1322
01:01:58,029 --> 01:02:01,099
but what's your opinion in the opposite
direction

1323
01:02:01,099 --> 01:02:04,569
jewlery administrators not just the
people who are trying to go against serb

1324
01:02:04,569 --> 01:02:06,288
anterior do what not

1325
01:02:06,289 --> 01:02:10,479
what is your opinion on the ambassador
to make it easier for these people

1326
01:02:10,479 --> 01:02:14,739
day using tools are packages okay okay
let me talk about this i think most

1327
01:02:14,739 --> 01:02:17,779
people will appreciate this position
actually

1328
01:02:17,779 --> 01:02:19,780
i think most administrators

1329
01:02:19,780 --> 01:02:21,620
barbieri are either

1330
01:02:21,620 --> 01:02:24,250
are poor are under trained in overworked

1331
01:02:24,250 --> 01:02:26,449
also underpaid as a matter of fact

1332
01:02:26,449 --> 01:02:28,930
a lot of companies these days

1333
01:02:28,930 --> 01:02:31,619
reap the benefits of of

1334
01:02:31,619 --> 01:02:33,699
automating their entire company

1335
01:02:33,699 --> 01:02:37,040
but it's not like well i can understand
by a computer system but

1336
01:02:37,040 --> 01:02:39,499
i have to hire a new person

1337
01:02:39,499 --> 01:02:41,990
or i'd have to send that person to a
class

1338
01:02:41,990 --> 01:02:45,910
bikes at well that person administered
windows three one for workgroups

1339
01:02:45,910 --> 01:02:49,690
followed our windows n_t_ a big deal
that must be the same thing as a net you

1340
01:02:49,690 --> 01:02:52,609
know just the next generation what
happens is

1341
01:02:52,609 --> 01:02:55,538
at mold most administrators are
well-meaning

1342
01:02:55,539 --> 01:02:56,690
the problem is

1343
01:02:56,690 --> 01:02:59,980
well actually all relate this story i
was talking to stocks ronnie

1344
01:02:59,980 --> 01:03:01,420
whom some you prolly hate

1345
01:03:01,420 --> 01:03:03,140
he's a person in charge of the

1346
01:03:03,140 --> 01:03:04,650
department of justice

1347
01:03:04,650 --> 01:03:07,630
computer crime unit he's responsible for
investing

1348
01:03:07,630 --> 01:03:12,100
for prosecuting federal crimes dealing
with computer laws and he told me it

1349
01:03:12,100 --> 01:03:15,260
scared him when he first learned about
them peters they took a class in

1350
01:03:15,260 --> 01:03:16,459
baltimore

1351
01:03:16,459 --> 01:03:20,509
and he was saying around having the
teacher introduce everybody

1352
01:03:20,509 --> 01:03:23,820
well yeah he's like this one woman
struck struck dumb

1353
01:03:23,820 --> 01:03:28,140
she's like oh yeah hi my name sue uh...
i'm the admin i'm the new administrator

1354
01:03:28,140 --> 01:03:30,629
for my company and i was made the
administrator

1355
01:03:30,630 --> 01:03:32,470
because on well

1356
01:03:32,470 --> 01:03:33,649
we ended up

1357
01:03:33,649 --> 01:03:37,729
hi i was a person with the most computer
aptitude son now the administration here

1358
01:03:37,729 --> 01:03:39,959
learn about units or whatever

1359
01:03:39,959 --> 01:03:41,529
and that's who they put in

1360
01:03:41,529 --> 01:03:44,389
they tend to put in some might without
good degree then in putting somebody

1361
01:03:44,389 --> 01:03:46,099
should be well paid

1362
01:03:46,099 --> 01:03:49,270
and the companies are suffering for that
i'm not saying the company's

1363
01:03:49,270 --> 01:03:53,719
are free a blaine but i'm saying it's
still a crime that's all

1364
01:03:53,719 --> 01:03:55,269
but again companies are

1365
01:03:55,269 --> 01:03:58,339
tefl enough real blaine if they don't
want to put the truck the effort into

1366
01:03:58,339 --> 01:04:01,959
training their people but again it is
getting better there are better people

1367
01:04:01,959 --> 01:04:02,859
thanks

1368
01:04:02,859 --> 01:04:03,989
as you say that

1369
01:04:03,989 --> 01:04:07,899
arugula minister came in with a degree
in four st and uh...

1370
01:04:07,899 --> 01:04:12,538
you had to use that ought to be
mentioned dots so i guess it kinda shows

1371
01:04:12,539 --> 01:04:16,469
well again i don't say one degrees
better than another most of those who

1372
01:04:16,469 --> 01:04:18,369
say that mister i'm happy breeze

1373
01:04:18,369 --> 01:04:20,679
and i'm also a psychology major so i a m

1374
01:04:20,679 --> 01:04:22,039
uh... sucked back

1375
01:04:22,039 --> 01:04:24,069
yet thanks for your talk ayam

1376
01:04:24,069 --> 01:04:26,699
i definitely agree with

1377
01:04:26,699 --> 01:04:28,799
the gist of what you're saying much

1378
01:04:28,799 --> 01:04:32,699
seems to be uh...

1379
01:04:32,699 --> 01:04:36,900
for hacking to take place today you
don't need to break into anybody's

1380
01:04:36,900 --> 01:04:39,009
computers you can do it by yourself

1381
01:04:39,009 --> 01:04:42,569
do dinner on that in the privacy of your
own home just like all sorts of other

1382
01:04:42,569 --> 01:04:44,179
things that you could do it

1383
01:04:44,179 --> 01:04:47,259
that's nobody else's business

1384
01:04:47,259 --> 01:04:48,499
the excuse me

1385
01:04:48,499 --> 01:04:50,259
and i'm and i also agree

1386
01:04:50,259 --> 01:04:52,219
that uh...

1387
01:04:52,219 --> 01:04:56,389
for the most part the real difference
between the people that are here today

1388
01:04:56,389 --> 01:04:59,399
and the people that are committing the
true crimes that you

1389
01:04:59,399 --> 01:05:02,118
enjoy prosecuting that the crimes

1390
01:05:02,119 --> 01:05:04,299
i don't know there may be people here

1391
01:05:04,299 --> 01:05:07,609
who are here to find out about how to do
corporate espionage

1392
01:05:07,609 --> 01:05:11,150
or how to find out about have a small
secrets out of this country words with

1393
01:05:11,150 --> 01:05:12,869
other countries or whatever

1394
01:05:12,869 --> 01:05:14,090
it seems to me that

1395
01:05:14,090 --> 01:05:15,269
you know the most of the

1396
01:05:15,269 --> 01:05:18,529
people here and i started using
computers as a teenager

1397
01:05:18,529 --> 01:05:22,209
and it seems to be the most of the
people here you know younger people

1398
01:05:22,209 --> 01:05:23,629
people who are older

1399
01:05:23,629 --> 01:05:25,420
all have an interesting

1400
01:05:25,420 --> 01:05:31,559
informational technology not in criminal
technology and i really liked your talk

1401
01:05:31,559 --> 01:05:35,899
differentiating the two was very
informative but your attitude

1402
01:05:35,899 --> 01:05:40,199
towards calling people like digital
wannabes traditionally enters who are

1403
01:05:40,199 --> 01:05:41,069
here

1404
01:05:41,069 --> 01:05:44,929
you know that's definitely sort of more
should be more sort of directed towards

1405
01:05:44,929 --> 01:05:47,160
the people who wanted to crimes

1406
01:05:47,160 --> 01:05:54,160
but don't have any idea of how to do it

1407
01:05:54,869 --> 01:05:57,979
so highlights the whole thing

1408
01:05:57,979 --> 01:06:00,749
let me give you my attitude on that
apprised

1409
01:06:00,749 --> 01:06:04,329
and i'm saying they're trying to explain
to people know this is wrong you know

1410
01:06:04,329 --> 01:06:05,309
and really

1411
01:06:05,309 --> 01:06:08,389
it's sort of you know i hear people
getting up here in saint although you

1412
01:06:08,389 --> 01:06:11,819
know all your the best in the brightest
here that you're the information wars of

1413
01:06:11,819 --> 01:06:13,709
the future your this year that

1414
01:06:13,709 --> 01:06:16,169
when really i mean i got a limit

1415
01:06:16,169 --> 01:06:19,368
you know i've tried it both ways i've
sat down to talk to people

1416
01:06:19,369 --> 01:06:22,299
i tried talking to them nicely and i
don't know we're just wanna learn about

1417
01:06:22,299 --> 01:06:27,170
information we just want to do this and
my differentiation is if you are a

1418
01:06:27,170 --> 01:06:30,989
person who just wants to learn you know
read other people's email

1419
01:06:30,989 --> 01:06:33,010
i really have no respect for you

1420
01:06:33,010 --> 01:06:34,410
if you are a person

1421
01:06:34,410 --> 01:06:36,539
that wants to learn about computers

1422
01:06:36,539 --> 01:06:38,690
and in all honesty many of you do

1423
01:06:38,690 --> 01:06:41,979
who do fit into the clueless category
pour into my test

1424
01:06:41,979 --> 01:06:45,519
my test was meant it to be in a funny
way maybe it's a little harsher for some

1425
01:06:45,519 --> 01:06:47,169
people and they want to take

1426
01:06:47,169 --> 01:06:51,009
polite s was meant in a funny way to
give you a direction to go in other

1427
01:06:51,009 --> 01:06:54,659
words of learning when it's going ahead
in taking the next step after the next

1428
01:06:54,659 --> 01:06:56,120
to protect the system

1429
01:06:56,120 --> 01:06:58,179
they're going to head of protecting the
network

1430
01:06:58,179 --> 01:07:00,660
yeah again it's in your face type of
stuff at

1431
01:07:00,660 --> 01:07:02,410
i guess that's what the site called it

1432
01:07:02,410 --> 01:07:03,499
but on

1433
01:07:03,499 --> 01:07:05,319
honestly it's

1434
01:07:05,319 --> 01:07:08,680
that's just my style i have to apologize
if you are offended

1435
01:07:08,680 --> 01:07:10,199
and fit into the

1436
01:07:10,199 --> 01:07:11,900
you know fit into the wanna

1437
01:07:11,900 --> 01:07:18,900
learned category but there are a digital
yet i make no apologies

1438
01:07:21,849 --> 01:07:26,289
anyway i listen to dole's speech and i
got mixed reviews both ways whichever

1439
01:07:26,289 --> 01:07:27,649
way you want to take it

1440
01:07:27,649 --> 01:07:32,538
me personally being run around in acting
since the late nineteen eighties

1441
01:07:32,539 --> 01:07:36,419
i can understand where we first started
we had to do little things that you

1442
01:07:36,419 --> 01:07:41,019
think stupid or what happens to do

1443
01:07:41,019 --> 01:07:42,569
you call crime

1444
01:07:42,569 --> 01:07:43,869
i mean this day and age

1445
01:07:43,869 --> 01:07:45,480
what happens on the can do that

1446
01:07:45,480 --> 01:07:47,519
and me personally yes i did my time

1447
01:07:47,519 --> 01:07:51,109
got in trouble with the fed spent time
in rules for a prison camp and so forth

1448
01:07:51,109 --> 01:07:52,399
and so on

1449
01:07:52,399 --> 01:07:54,038
this day and age

1450
01:07:54,039 --> 01:07:55,120
maybe do you want

1451
01:07:55,120 --> 01:07:58,450
you'll have is one of the actors or
whatever you would like to uh... call

1452
01:07:58,450 --> 01:08:00,419
them mentors or whatever

1453
01:08:00,419 --> 01:08:04,669
they don't have to go through that but
back in the time when i started

1454
01:08:04,669 --> 01:08:06,038
computed c

1455
01:08:06,039 --> 01:08:08,789
there was something that was needed to
get information how would you be subtle

1456
01:08:08,789 --> 01:08:12,429
trash on another subject

1457
01:08:12,429 --> 01:08:14,999
but i've relied again

1458
01:08:14,999 --> 01:08:19,419
did position is that again i've got to
talk to other people the size of

1459
01:08:19,419 --> 01:08:21,259
you know i've talked let me put it this
way

1460
01:08:21,259 --> 01:08:25,179
i have a lot of good friends that fit it
that people would know of

1461
01:08:25,179 --> 01:08:28,989
and you know i'm so i'm not on the inner
hacker circle that a well-respected

1462
01:08:28,989 --> 01:08:33,299
and again these are people that i admit
if they wanted to learn about computers

1463
01:08:33,299 --> 01:08:36,679
in those days there was no such thing as
documentation

1464
01:08:36,679 --> 01:08:40,399
you know a later up and so i mean in all
honesty up until the nineteen

1465
01:08:40,400 --> 01:08:41,250
ninety

1466
01:08:41,250 --> 01:08:43,169
sue free time frame

1467
01:08:43,169 --> 01:08:46,179
you know computers were widely available
there was no such thing about the

1468
01:08:46,179 --> 01:08:46,919
internet

1469
01:08:46,919 --> 01:08:50,379
now not condoning this in any way but if
you do you wanna connect with computers

1470
01:08:50,379 --> 01:08:52,778
world wide and learning you know and

1471
01:08:52,779 --> 01:08:54,690
learn about other computer systems

1472
01:08:54,690 --> 01:08:59,229
you did have to do some level of packing
their phone freaking to get that access

1473
01:08:59,229 --> 01:09:01,989
and that's the thing is again like i
said up front

1474
01:09:01,989 --> 01:09:04,870
the intentions of these people were
purely honorable

1475
01:09:04,870 --> 01:09:07,140
the problem i'm having those lately

1476
01:09:07,140 --> 01:09:09,769
the intentions of the newer people
getting in there

1477
01:09:09,769 --> 01:09:12,150
the clueless teenagers as quote again

1478
01:09:12,149 --> 01:09:15,009
i believe it could be comment came from
route

1479
01:09:15,009 --> 01:09:17,988
you know the clue people f into the
clues teenager category

1480
01:09:17,989 --> 01:09:20,139
are not out there to learn about them
puter is

1481
01:09:20,139 --> 01:09:22,009
what i'm trying to do win this thing

1482
01:09:22,009 --> 01:09:25,479
again my purpose my presentation was to
help differentiate

1483
01:09:25,479 --> 01:09:27,130
who's a close teenager

1484
01:09:27,130 --> 01:09:30,600
and try to get them if they really do
you want to be a real hacker appoint to

1485
01:09:30,600 --> 01:09:31,850
the real hackers

1486
01:09:31,850 --> 01:09:33,839
or who they consider the real hackers

1487
01:09:33,839 --> 01:09:37,149
then i'll try to point them in a
direction i mean again the like you're

1488
01:09:37,149 --> 01:09:39,689
saying i sampled by clarify that up
front

1489
01:09:39,690 --> 01:09:43,909
by babbling outside but also at the same
time i've seen quite a few black base i

1490
01:09:43,908 --> 01:09:45,238
mean i see them at the

1491
01:09:45,239 --> 01:09:48,179
or one of the action you act is on the
way

1492
01:09:48,179 --> 01:09:51,489
peggy said all one one two or three them
with uh...

1493
01:09:51,489 --> 01:09:54,230
how the system and what's going on how
to handle

1494
01:09:54,230 --> 01:09:55,620
westley dodd

1495
01:09:55,620 --> 01:09:57,160
more than a dozen active set

1496
01:09:57,160 --> 01:09:59,369
i've met that shortly damn little

1497
01:09:59,369 --> 01:10:03,940
little groups that they go through
different system today

1498
01:10:03,940 --> 01:10:05,510
notify the system at

1499
01:10:05,510 --> 01:10:08,800
and at the same time activated at

1500
01:10:08,800 --> 01:10:12,399
notify the system admin office two
months later of course it would exploit

1501
01:10:12,399 --> 01:10:14,619
up on the website of p_b_s_

1502
01:10:14,619 --> 01:10:16,949
the digital

1503
01:10:16,949 --> 01:10:18,900
semester time but i think is

1504
01:10:18,900 --> 01:10:21,989
fair enough to let everybody know what
the exploitive

1505
01:10:21,989 --> 01:10:25,550
but i appreciate that and again the my
reaction to that is

1506
01:10:25,550 --> 01:10:28,770
if you're really posting that
information on a bulletin board

1507
01:10:28,770 --> 01:10:32,180
ill-equipped to supposing the
information on the bulletin board is to

1508
01:10:32,180 --> 01:10:34,080
let other people know you did it

1509
01:10:34,080 --> 01:10:36,989
i mean i know there's some mighty hacker
ethic which says

1510
01:10:36,989 --> 01:10:39,920
ono share your information given the
opportunity

1511
01:10:39,920 --> 01:10:41,989
i wish more hackers who do that

1512
01:10:41,989 --> 01:10:45,400
you know give them the opportunity to
fix this system before they posted

1513
01:10:45,400 --> 01:10:48,550
i know the loft is intelligence about
how they

1514
01:10:48,550 --> 01:10:52,469
release vulnerabilities you know so
there's a chance to fix it first

1515
01:10:52,469 --> 01:10:55,070
you know again my personal opinion is if
you're good

1516
01:10:55,070 --> 01:10:58,400
you're not out there to prove anything
to people if you broke n

1517
01:10:58,400 --> 01:11:01,849
your duties should be content enough
with yourself does otherwise in all

1518
01:11:01,849 --> 01:11:04,760
honesty if you let people know you just
advertising the facts

1519
01:11:04,760 --> 01:11:06,949
he did commit a crime

1520
01:11:06,949 --> 01:11:09,909
balance architect we don't have any
questions that i don't respect

1521
01:11:09,909 --> 01:11:10,869
european but

1522
01:11:10,869 --> 01:11:14,598
there are other people and i don't be
rude to the people following me

1523
01:11:14,599 --> 01:11:17,409
what would you say the portraits people
that don't have a

1524
01:11:17,409 --> 01:11:21,629
phone system in their bedroom to go and
play around with i mean that's back in

1525
01:11:21,630 --> 01:11:25,239
the nineteen eighties for just generic
here akers

1526
01:11:25,239 --> 01:11:26,510
my and i'm really

1527
01:11:26,510 --> 01:11:29,130
like you know my these adjust my
opinions and

1528
01:11:29,130 --> 01:11:31,939
as far as phone freaking goes on

1529
01:11:31,939 --> 01:11:35,379
that's to me as a really dangerous thing
'cause the people that sensitive phone

1530
01:11:35,379 --> 01:11:36,420
freaking

1531
01:11:36,420 --> 01:11:39,060
the people out of ten to do tended to do
it

1532
01:11:39,060 --> 01:11:42,359
it's just two easy for them to start
getting into

1533
01:11:42,359 --> 01:11:45,590
listening to friends family and people
they don't like

1534
01:11:45,590 --> 01:11:47,070
and tapping their phones

1535
01:11:47,070 --> 01:11:50,900
and again there's you know in my opinion
if you want to hack something to learn

1536
01:11:50,900 --> 01:11:53,820
about it that's one thing but when you
want a hack

1537
01:11:53,820 --> 01:11:57,269
when you and a hack and start listening
and invade people's privacy that's

1538
01:11:57,270 --> 01:11:59,709
another

1539
01:11:59,709 --> 01:12:01,239
sicily

1540
01:12:01,239 --> 01:12:05,360
