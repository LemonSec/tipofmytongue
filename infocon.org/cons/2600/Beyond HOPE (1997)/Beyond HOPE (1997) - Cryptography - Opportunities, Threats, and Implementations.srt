1
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:22,160
everybody you wanna take your seats
right now

2
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:27,730
Reznor I running about 45 minutes late
so

3
00:00:27,730 --> 00:00:34,730
there's not much time for mingling

4
00:01:06,470 --> 00:01:09,408
right

5
00:01:09,409 --> 00:01:13,030
I hello number Shire I'm gonna spend an
hour talking about

6
00:01:13,030 --> 00:01:17,729
cryptography and how it relates to
security and how it affects

7
00:01:17,729 --> 00:01:22,649
us are not going to do any any man and
very little technology spent a lot of

8
00:01:22,649 --> 00:01:23,710
time talking about

9
00:01:23,710 --> 00:01:27,479
the social issues and the real problems
all

10
00:01:27,479 --> 00:01:32,690
often the other promise of cryptography
are things like tripled as an MD for the

11
00:01:32,690 --> 00:01:33,470
reality

12
00:01:33,470 --> 00:01:36,670
is more like the stuff you just saw
about Microsoft

13
00:01:36,670 --> 00:01:39,850
and i wanna talk a lot about that
relationship because thats

14
00:01:39,850 --> 00:01:45,520
you're really well what matters that's
the boring title for all the boring

15
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:46,250
types

16
00:01:46,250 --> 00:01:49,810
of I'll have a postscript version

17
00:01:49,810 --> 00:01:53,770
this available Fred Taylor send me
e-mail so that it wants copies of the

18
00:01:53,770 --> 00:01:58,330
the overheads is more what I send you
they'll do here

19
00:01:58,330 --> 00:02:01,970
sons I'll just try to limit this so my
email addresses

20
00:02:01,970 --> 00:02:08,970
pretty easy to remember

21
00:02:09,769 --> 00:02:13,859
sucked on a peace actually a pretty cool
thing he could do a lot of good stuff

22
00:02:13,859 --> 00:02:18,480
righted it it protects privacy it does
anonymity

23
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:23,319
does authentication it does trust
credentials integrity

24
00:02:23,319 --> 00:02:27,739
we can do fairness electronic commerce
we can do audits

25
00:02:27,739 --> 00:02:32,989
i fundamentally it stops lying and
cheating that that's the promise

26
00:02:32,989 --> 00:02:37,420
right

27
00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:43,310
none other this is new luis free likes
to talk about the new dangers of

28
00:02:43,310 --> 00:02:44,239
cryptography

29
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:47,400
we'll talk all about those things none
of this is new

30
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:53,500
right everybody used to have privacy
before Electronix privacy was

31
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:57,430
easy to get I'll

32
00:02:57,430 --> 00:03:01,409
everyone used to have authentication
physical recognition

33
00:03:01,409 --> 00:03:05,030
voice authentication handwriting
signatures is

34
00:03:05,030 --> 00:03:08,389
all IOU's fight authentication orkut
talker

35
00:03:08,389 --> 00:03:11,769
the is doing is allowing us to take all
those constructs

36
00:03:11,769 --> 00:03:15,639
from the real world and move them into
the world to cyberspace

37
00:03:15,639 --> 00:03:19,709
but that's the big deal were cited to
see society in cyberspace

38
00:03:19,709 --> 00:03:22,949
we want to take the same social and
business constructs

39
00:03:22,949 --> 00:03:26,419
like privacy liked ross like and
identity

40
00:03:26,419 --> 00:03:29,470
like reputations and move them

41
00:03:29,470 --> 00:03:32,949
into this new world so photography

42
00:03:32,949 --> 00:03:36,659
is is equalizing technology by moving
the stuff

43
00:03:36,659 --> 00:03:42,120
and this is all

44
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:45,299
turning out to be a really big deal
right

45
00:03:45,299 --> 00:03:49,870
real important now we have the net as a
real-life business tool

46
00:03:49,870 --> 00:03:54,000
five years ago you hack into the net you
get some obscure technical manuals

47
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,739
so a lot now you hack into the net you
can take down a company

48
00:03:57,739 --> 00:04:03,479
you can steal money it matters right
every computers

49
00:04:03,479 --> 00:04:07,079
connected to every other computer in
this more good stuff on

50
00:04:07,079 --> 00:04:11,560
so as as a place for criminal to go

51
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:15,709
the net is much more track than it was a
few years ago right

52
00:04:15,709 --> 00:04:20,988
the content to value vacations real
value we switch starting to see

53
00:04:20,989 --> 00:04:25,289
are legal proceedings trials using close
circuit video links

54
00:04:25,289 --> 00:04:30,570
overseeing mailed in elections a lot of
the things we used to do face to face

55
00:04:30,570 --> 00:04:31,719
when outdoing remotely

56
00:04:31,719 --> 00:04:35,800
and these things will move on to the net
right real commerce

57
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:39,250
and relationships forming an existing in
cyberspace

58
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:46,250
another new thing that we didn't have a
decade ago

59
00:04:47,249 --> 00:04:51,389
met unfortunately most the security
products out there really aren't secure

60
00:04:51,389 --> 00:04:52,080
at all

61
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:55,310
most them don't use could talk of a

62
00:04:55,310 --> 00:04:58,949
those that do stick in at the last
minute %uh

63
00:04:58,949 --> 00:05:03,569
those that do don't hire real
cryptographic engineers and do the kind

64
00:05:03,569 --> 00:05:04,800
of thing at Microsoft did

65
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:08,740
I could walk in and fix that problem
with a couple attack stores here and

66
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:09,150
there

67
00:05:09,150 --> 00:05:13,699
it's not a complicated issue solved the
company

68
00:05:13,699 --> 00:05:16,849
you to get it wrong again and again are

69
00:05:16,849 --> 00:05:20,219
the products out there are usually
pretty bad

70
00:05:20,219 --> 00:05:24,710
they're not flexible the hard to use
their bulky the solutions often

71
00:05:24,710 --> 00:05:25,609
downscale

72
00:05:25,610 --> 00:05:30,800
the work for ten one user a 10 users but
won't work on a network a thousand users

73
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:35,370
are often products don't solve the
correct problem

74
00:05:35,370 --> 00:05:39,139
fundamentally the first thing you want
to do when looking at a security problem

75
00:05:39,139 --> 00:05:43,360
is figure out what the problem is a
figure out what the trust relationships

76
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:43,900
are

77
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:47,129
that you want to move into cyberspace
very often

78
00:05:47,129 --> 00:05:50,779
existing product don't take that
approach and the end up making

79
00:05:50,779 --> 00:05:54,550
incorrect fundamental assumptions and
solving a different problem

80
00:05:54,550 --> 00:05:58,539
the problem they think their salt and
sometimes actually will create new

81
00:05:58,539 --> 00:05:59,438
problems

82
00:05:59,439 --> 00:06:03,750
the resulting system the more in secure
after this case offers been installed

83
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:07,370
and internet on top of that

84
00:06:07,370 --> 00:06:10,439
generic operating systems are buggy

85
00:06:10,439 --> 00:06:14,909
which makes any security solution on top
of that all that more problematic

86
00:06:14,909 --> 00:06:19,979
but that's actually okay because people
buy the stuff anyway

87
00:06:19,979 --> 00:06:23,339
you can make a lot of money selling a
bad firewall

88
00:06:23,339 --> 00:06:26,610
just getting CSA approval which isn't
hard to get

89
00:06:26,610 --> 00:06:29,789
sell it and you know

90
00:06:29,789 --> 00:06:33,529
we have a problem here the public the
consumers

91
00:06:33,529 --> 00:06:38,149
are not educated they can tell there's
in a good security partner bad security

92
00:06:38,149 --> 00:06:38,889
product

93
00:06:38,889 --> 00:06:42,139
products are what I call buzzword
compliance

94
00:06:42,139 --> 00:06:46,110
we used as we use tripled s which is
pretty much meaningless

95
00:06:46,110 --> 00:06:53,110
but meet some corporate checklist and
fortunately the near term I see this

96
00:06:56,159 --> 00:06:58,819
getting worse

97
00:06:58,819 --> 00:07:02,779
make more and more stuff is going
on-line the important stuff this

98
00:07:02,779 --> 00:07:03,569
electronic

99
00:07:03,569 --> 00:07:07,199
ten years ago the electronic stuff was
unimportant the important stuff was

100
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:08,750
handed now handled manually

101
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:13,190
that's being swapped right financial
fraud processing

102
00:07:13,190 --> 00:07:18,300
medical information it's been a number
of good newspaper articles on dangers

103
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:18,849
uva

104
00:07:18,849 --> 00:07:24,000
a medical privacy a judicial and law
databases

105
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,319
companies that are depending very
heavily on

106
00:07:27,319 --> 00:07:30,899
on networks not just to do business
efficiently

107
00:07:30,899 --> 00:07:34,310
but to do business at all and

108
00:07:34,310 --> 00:07:39,009
the newer technologies and not being
less secure at the new our stock is

109
00:07:39,009 --> 00:07:39,659
different

110
00:07:39,659 --> 00:07:44,050
we're not sure how it works we
understand the security properties

111
00:07:44,050 --> 00:07:49,289
%uh and we push into market by water
company and say look you have a good

112
00:07:49,289 --> 00:07:50,209
product but

113
00:07:50,209 --> 00:07:54,819
let's wait six months before we r
fielded to fix a security

114
00:07:54,819 --> 00:07:57,919
the president of from out his office we
can't do that

115
00:07:57,919 --> 00:08:01,330
the the net is all about getting an ex
tax:

116
00:08:01,330 --> 00:08:05,628
next big thing out there as fast as
possible and fortunately that's

117
00:08:05,629 --> 00:08:08,889
opposite to security right

118
00:08:08,889 --> 00:08:15,009
the fast media's and secure the Internet
is less secure than dedicated lines

119
00:08:15,009 --> 00:08:20,449
sailors less secure than landlines i
doing things

120
00:08:20,449 --> 00:08:26,029
automatic automatically is less secure
than annually so we're seeing a lot of

121
00:08:26,029 --> 00:08:27,879
these new things and we're seeing a

122
00:08:27,879 --> 00:08:31,240
stuff diversify so if you want to attack

123
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:35,568
a communications link it might be going
over five different physical media

124
00:08:35,568 --> 00:08:39,519
to get attacked the weakest point
similar to what we saw with the

125
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:42,810
NT Hasna lamb and hash they're both
being used

126
00:08:42,810 --> 00:08:47,000
we can attack the weakest one so even if
we fix a piece

127
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,300
we have to fix the weakest piece to make
a difference

128
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:53,930
I we're seeing a lot more mobile
solutions out there and we're seeing

129
00:08:53,930 --> 00:08:55,790
stuff come faster and faster

130
00:08:55,790 --> 00:08:59,339
and security is really against the floss
the Internet

131
00:08:59,339 --> 00:09:05,699
and it slows down progress

132
00:09:05,699 --> 00:09:09,949
kinda like this

133
00:09:09,949 --> 00:09:13,959
your unwanted

134
00:09:13,959 --> 00:09:20,959
I so what are the threats

135
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:25,770
I to a first approximation the threats
against digital systems

136
00:09:25,770 --> 00:09:29,560
are the same threats against their
analog analogues

137
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:34,380
right criminals will attack sources for
financial gain

138
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:38,000
they will be privacy violations against
systems for

139
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:42,320
for various reasons right this is no big
deal this is nothing new

140
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:47,860
so when we're looking at what are the
risks what are the dangers

141
00:09:47,860 --> 00:09:51,810
you look you look at existing systems
look at previous systems

142
00:09:51,810 --> 00:09:54,870
use to try to see where criminals have
exploited

143
00:09:54,870 --> 00:09:59,310
problems for financial gain now

144
00:09:59,310 --> 00:10:02,600
unfortunately there are three
characteristics

145
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:06,070
love up cyberspace that make attacks

146
00:10:06,070 --> 00:10:09,640
much worse I and the first one is
automation

147
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:15,650
nobody would care if I figured out a way
to counterfeit nichols'

148
00:10:15,650 --> 00:10:20,060
definitely doesn't matter I can't make
enough nichols to make a difference

149
00:10:20,060 --> 00:10:25,260
at the a rainy ins have some really
impressive printing presses

150
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:28,830
making hundred-dollar bills we can
calculate

151
00:10:28,830 --> 00:10:32,410
how much money they could make on the
press is 24 hours a day

152
00:10:32,410 --> 00:10:36,680
365 days a year and this is the max
manana damage they can do

153
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:41,930
notes we know what that is are now on
the Nets

154
00:10:41,930 --> 00:10:45,490
because I can automate my attack if I
can

155
00:10:45,490 --> 00:10:49,700
Caliphate nichols' I may be able to make
million dollars over night

156
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:52,800
or in a week so attacks that

157
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:56,660
flew below the radar suddenly become
importance

158
00:10:56,660 --> 00:11:00,040
I the stupid a 20-year-old

159
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:03,260
tak love skimming the fractions of
pennies

160
00:11:03,260 --> 00:11:06,920
from people's interest accounts nice
example of this

161
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:12,719
that attack wouldn't be possible without
automation and the same thing about

162
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:15,940
the marginal marginal probability of
success

163
00:11:15,940 --> 00:11:19,070
if I found a way to pick someone's
pocket that would work

164
00:11:19,070 --> 00:11:22,660
one in a million times that wouldn't be
very useful

165
00:11:22,660 --> 00:11:27,530
but I can automated put out a net I get
seven success in today

166
00:11:27,530 --> 00:11:33,650
second problem is action at a distance

167
00:11:33,650 --> 00:11:37,329
all of our laws are really based on
proximity

168
00:11:37,330 --> 00:11:40,380
see an attacker getting in front of
somebody

169
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:43,640
and committing some crimes on the net

170
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:47,030
its it's very hard to establish
jurisdiction

171
00:11:47,030 --> 00:11:50,410
it's very hard to track where somebody's
coming from

172
00:11:50,410 --> 00:11:54,819
%uh if you're a are reasonably well
funded criminal

173
00:11:54,820 --> 00:11:59,070
you could pick a jurisdiction with up
allows the police force

174
00:11:59,070 --> 00:12:05,850
and launch attacks from there really on
the net for a lot of attacks

175
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:10,970
the the legal system is only as good as
the weakest legal system on the net

176
00:12:10,970 --> 00:12:15,500
and I would expect to see jurisdiction
shopping where people with pictures

177
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:19,540
texan's launch attacks from the third

178
00:12:19,540 --> 00:12:23,319
the third big problem is is a speech in
which attacks propagates

179
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:27,330
you could look at a lot of attacks
against systems

180
00:12:27,330 --> 00:12:30,770
and realize a limit to the damage they
can do

181
00:12:30,770 --> 00:12:36,630
you look at a tax against pay-t_v_ of
buying and selling set-top boxes making

182
00:12:36,630 --> 00:12:40,310
getting free television if someone works
in their basement for a weekend

183
00:12:40,310 --> 00:12:44,850
makes himself a little box second is
television gets free TV

184
00:12:44,850 --> 00:12:49,959
that's great he deserves it let him have
it murdoch doesn't care it doesn't

185
00:12:49,959 --> 00:12:51,209
affect its revenue

186
00:12:51,209 --> 00:12:55,780
because fundamentally only very few
people could do that

187
00:12:55,780 --> 00:12:59,079
if someone goes out tries to sell these
boxes

188
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:03,250
yeah he'll be captured by conventional
criminal techniques we know how to deal

189
00:13:03,250 --> 00:13:04,140
with dealers

190
00:13:04,140 --> 00:13:07,850
but on the net it's all software

191
00:13:07,850 --> 00:13:11,490
if someone comes out with a software
program that would break

192
00:13:11,490 --> 00:13:16,260
a credit card protocol posted on the net
you get a hundred thousand people using

193
00:13:16,260 --> 00:13:17,089
it overnight

194
00:13:17,089 --> 00:13:21,450
physical attacks by their nature

195
00:13:21,450 --> 00:13:26,660
all level of it how much damage they can
do saw for only attacks

196
00:13:26,660 --> 00:13:29,880
can be can blow up exponentially you can

197
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:32,930
destroy systems very quickly and

198
00:13:32,930 --> 00:13:37,209
so historically if you look at truly
commerce systems

199
00:13:37,209 --> 00:13:41,280
they've been very reactive typer fraught
happens

200
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:44,760
figure out a way to fix it and you know
in a in a few months they solve it

201
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:48,100
or couple years and they keep their
losses until then

202
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:51,440
that only works with physical attacks

203
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:54,949
with net access offer only that can

204
00:13:54,949 --> 00:13:58,589
explode exponentially you can't be
reactive anymore

205
00:13:58,589 --> 00:14:05,589
just don't have the time

206
00:14:06,510 --> 00:14:10,360
so now I want to run through some other
the I felt his

207
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:14,040
three different kinds of attacks the 1
I've been talking about pretty much

208
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:18,579
for now it's a criminal tax rates really
easy how can I make money by attacking

209
00:14:18,579 --> 00:14:21,850
this system and it's all the things
you'd expect it to be

210
00:14:21,850 --> 00:14:25,680
its forgery misrepresentation replay
repudiation

211
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:28,899
cap August counterfeiting is forgery %uh

212
00:14:28,899 --> 00:14:32,649
generally these attacks are
opportunistic often it's insiders

213
00:14:32,649 --> 00:14:36,029
are usually the use the minimum
necessary resources

214
00:14:36,029 --> 00:14:39,510
they'll focus on low-tech flaws

215
00:14:39,510 --> 00:14:44,100
the usually won't attack things like the
cryptography more likely to

216
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:48,120
your steel stacker cards and an attack
it that way or

217
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:51,720
guess lousy passwords or bribe somebody
are

218
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:54,870
it will focus on the week systems so the

219
00:14:54,870 --> 00:14:59,079
joke about not having tout run that they
are only have a cap run your friends

220
00:14:59,079 --> 00:15:02,380
works here your system is better than
the next one

221
00:15:02,380 --> 00:15:09,380
it slow you know it's likely be avoided
by criminals

222
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:16,630
and for electronic commerce but we're
likely to see a lot a criminal attacks

223
00:15:16,630 --> 00:15:20,150
right we've seen criminal tax gets every
commerce's than ever invented

224
00:15:20,150 --> 00:15:23,530
and list a few there

225
00:15:23,530 --> 00:15:27,150
from way to scale to shaving coinage to
forging stock certificates

226
00:15:27,150 --> 00:15:31,140
by an electronic commerce will be the
same as soon as the money is there

227
00:15:31,140 --> 00:15:32,280
criminals will be there

228
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:37,360
and will be loan criminals up to
organized crime I know I was gonna give

229
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:38,830
a talk tonight talking about

230
00:15:38,830 --> 00:15:42,980
how some crime syndicates are using
hacker tools

231
00:15:42,980 --> 00:15:48,550
in this this is gonna continue I listen
to the three differences

232
00:15:48,550 --> 00:15:52,640
why it's gonna be worse on the net %uh
one thing we're not doing enough for

233
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:53,439
these audits

234
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:56,830
might let I don't mean auditing a system
like

235
00:15:56,830 --> 00:16:00,340
balloting security I mean building an
audit trail

236
00:16:00,340 --> 00:16:03,450
we don't prevent crime in this country

237
00:16:03,450 --> 00:16:07,260
so do the math if someone wanted to kill
you they would just kill you

238
00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:12,370
what we do is we detect crime after the
fact are you lying there bleeding

239
00:16:12,370 --> 00:16:16,580
week try to build a body is evidence

240
00:16:16,580 --> 00:16:19,600
that can be used to convince a neutral
third party

241
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:23,670
judge and jury of the perpetrators kilts

242
00:16:23,670 --> 00:16:27,560
and then punish the perpetrator and then
we tried assume this some

243
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:32,610
back-channel which will prevent further
crime so

244
00:16:32,610 --> 00:16:36,390
so given that makes a lot of sense to
rebuild these commerce systems

245
00:16:36,390 --> 00:16:40,689
to put in very strong audit capability
to be able to detect crime

246
00:16:40,690 --> 00:16:45,430
and to build a body in evidence %uh

247
00:16:45,430 --> 00:16:48,660
I know their commerce systems where they
can figure out

248
00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:52,250
who did the fraud but they can bring the
evidence

249
00:16:52,250 --> 00:16:56,750
into a public courtroom because by doing
so the compromise for the security I

250
00:16:56,750 --> 00:16:57,830
mean that's not very good

251
00:16:57,830 --> 00:17:04,319
is a new kind of role as I really

252
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:08,020
new words it's going to get a lot worse
is identity theft

253
00:17:08,020 --> 00:17:11,420
as as more the stuff goes online

254
00:17:11,420 --> 00:17:15,829
as our online and he becomes more
important stealing our online and you

255
00:17:15,829 --> 00:17:16,980
will become more valuable

256
00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:21,390
and you can re privacy times get lot a
great war stories

257
00:17:21,390 --> 00:17:24,990
of people had their identities stolen
have credit cards issued

258
00:17:24,990 --> 00:17:28,400
in their name this is going to become
worse

259
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:31,890
wish which spent

260
00:17:31,890 --> 00:17:35,960
a buncha years in the fiction that
mother's maiden name is good enough and

261
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:42,960
really that fiction is over and is
nothing good to replace it yet

262
00:17:48,860 --> 00:17:52,650
I love privacy violations into a creek
as a criminal attack

263
00:17:52,650 --> 00:17:57,490
%uh not sure belongs here very often
especially in this country

264
00:17:57,490 --> 00:18:02,240
privacy violations are actually legal
you do not own the information about you

265
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:03,430
stored in databases

266
00:18:03,430 --> 00:18:08,360
but s especially some countries in
Europe a better about that

267
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:12,400
and and laws might change and there are
legal privacy violations

268
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:15,940
is basically two types at one is a
targeted attack

269
00:18:15,940 --> 00:18:20,520
where I want to know everything about up
sick person or company

270
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:24,970
and I will target them now cryptography

271
00:18:24,970 --> 00:18:29,420
and computer screen in general can
protect you but only up to the point on

272
00:18:29,420 --> 00:18:30,450
to the point where

273
00:18:30,450 --> 00:18:34,280
someone will come in and fuck your room
or

274
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:37,520
go through your trash or to any other
non

275
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:43,270
computer-based attacks welcome talks
begin do so. make the attacker have to

276
00:18:43,270 --> 00:18:47,530
get close and personal to put himself at
risk he will be able to sit at home

277
00:18:47,530 --> 00:18:52,860
and spy on you from the safety this
computer a second kinda

278
00:18:52,860 --> 00:18:56,430
privacy violations what I call data
harvesting and

279
00:18:56,430 --> 00:18:59,840
thats example that is I wanna listed
every

280
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:03,139
widows sixty years or older with more
than

281
00:19:03,140 --> 00:19:06,820
two million dollars in the bank has
given to more than a dozen charities in

282
00:19:06,820 --> 00:19:07,710
the past year

283
00:19:07,710 --> 00:19:13,590
and regularly Reacher Harsco that's a
database i want for whatever reason and

284
00:19:13,590 --> 00:19:16,530
me there are many attacks that are based
on data harvesting

285
00:19:16,530 --> 00:19:21,780
up in the movie Paper Moon is a good
example of depression attack

286
00:19:21,780 --> 00:19:26,379
where someone would go to the obituary
column find the names are wealthy people

287
00:19:26,380 --> 00:19:27,000
who died

288
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:31,670
and try to sell their will stuff he
supposedly bought while he was alive

289
00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:36,090
there've been attacks I think as
recently as the Vietnam War

290
00:19:36,090 --> 00:19:38,889
where

291
00:19:38,890 --> 00:19:42,340
a con artist will go to the families of
servicemen died overseas

292
00:19:42,340 --> 00:19:45,909
and charge them money supposedly attend
their graves these are data harvesting

293
00:19:45,910 --> 00:19:46,950
attacks

294
00:19:46,950 --> 00:19:50,860
we're looking for people they meet
certain criteria so we can try to

295
00:19:50,860 --> 00:19:51,560
defraud them

296
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:56,360
now pataki he's actually really good
against protect protecting against that

297
00:19:56,360 --> 00:20:00,970
because we can't hide all the data and
make it impossible to the attacker to

298
00:20:00,970 --> 00:20:01,820
sift through it all

299
00:20:01,820 --> 00:20:07,389
so you can get a list everybody takes
ECT in this country because that date

300
00:20:07,390 --> 00:20:08,630
isn't available

301
00:20:08,630 --> 00:20:11,890
cryptid now of course you there are
still the

302
00:20:11,890 --> 00:20:15,710
the human attacks right driving and
operating was legal access the data

303
00:20:15,710 --> 00:20:22,710
his second kind of attack ads

304
00:20:23,050 --> 00:20:26,810
fundamentally different than a prior
then a a criminal tax what I call

305
00:20:26,810 --> 00:20:27,820
publicity attack

306
00:20:27,820 --> 00:20:32,610
and the goal is how can I get the most
publicity by attacking the system I want

307
00:20:32,610 --> 00:20:34,090
my name in the New York Times

308
00:20:34,090 --> 00:20:37,350
when I have to do to get and

309
00:20:37,350 --> 00:20:43,910
know this is kinda neat because a lot of
companies aren't ready for this

310
00:20:43,910 --> 00:20:48,030
right the good example is are the
netscape fuck

311
00:20:48,030 --> 00:20:52,610
found down by the University a
California Berkeley grad students

312
00:20:52,610 --> 00:20:55,740
netscape did the analysis and figured
out

313
00:20:55,740 --> 00:20:58,770
wasn't profitable for anybody to

314
00:20:58,770 --> 00:21:03,060
break it's because we take so much
computer time at the Berkeley grad

315
00:21:03,060 --> 00:21:05,720
students had the computers lying around
on their laps

316
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:10,970
is we're using it didn't have to
actually go out by them rights attackers

317
00:21:10,970 --> 00:21:12,570
are typically very skilled

318
00:21:12,570 --> 00:21:17,000
their backs significant resources either
at the University rather company

319
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:21,000
%uh usually have no social lives that
large amounts of time

320
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:28,000
they don't have a lot of money and they
have a lower risk tolerance

321
00:21:28,230 --> 00:21:33,420
that you don't go to jail this attack is

322
00:21:33,420 --> 00:21:36,860
is very important especially in eroding
public confidence

323
00:21:36,860 --> 00:21:42,780
thanks thanks are very careful not to
talk about successful attacks

324
00:21:42,780 --> 00:21:47,860
they don't want public confidence eroded
even more than the money lost

325
00:21:47,860 --> 00:21:51,960
value loss to people not trusting
assistants Greater

326
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:55,000
so when there are when you see

327
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:59,210
month after month new bucks coming after
the netscape for Mike's

328
00:21:59,210 --> 00:22:04,570
in an employer explore people are
trusting security less and less

329
00:22:04,570 --> 00:22:07,570
it's probably a good thing security
kinda sucks

330
00:22:07,570 --> 00:22:14,570
but for a company this is a big problem

331
00:22:18,460 --> 00:22:21,600
at the third shorter attackers is the
legal attack in this is kind of like a

332
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:23,100
publicity attack with the budget

333
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:29,210
and the question is how can I discredit
this system

334
00:22:29,210 --> 00:22:33,100
to get my client of make he

335
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:37,450
law someone is being accused of fraud or
car crime

336
00:22:37,450 --> 00:22:41,090
and there is some evidence from this
computer security system

337
00:22:41,090 --> 00:22:46,020
and wanted you guys is hired as an
expert witness

338
00:22:46,020 --> 00:22:51,360
by the defense to to insult the system
in front of the jury

339
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:55,690
that's kinda makes you don't have to
actually find a flaw you don't have to

340
00:22:55,690 --> 00:22:56,190
actually

341
00:22:56,190 --> 00:23:00,070
demonstrated successful attack all you
need to do is

342
00:23:00,070 --> 00:23:04,679
is justice system enough that the jury
doesn't believe it anymore which is a

343
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:05,430
lot easier

344
00:23:05,430 --> 00:23:09,050
and in cases that might be

345
00:23:09,050 --> 00:23:12,780
me a multi-million dollar settlements
some the industrial espionage cases

346
00:23:12,780 --> 00:23:13,389
we're seeing

347
00:23:13,390 --> 00:23:18,330
this could be a really big deal you had
the benefit discovery you wanna

348
00:23:18,330 --> 00:23:23,290
you want the system specs Happy Tree
demand from the other side

349
00:23:23,290 --> 00:23:29,290
and so you'll be able to get all the
details you need

350
00:23:29,290 --> 00:23:33,450
up the NSA wrestled with this when they
were

351
00:23:33,450 --> 00:23:36,980
prosecuting John Walker the question was
whether they should

352
00:23:36,980 --> 00:23:40,770
openly discuss their photography boxes

353
00:23:40,770 --> 00:23:44,150
how they worked what they did what
Walker actually did bike

354
00:23:44,150 --> 00:23:47,360
by compromising the keys when they
should discuss this

355
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:50,630
in a public forum or whether they should
keep quiet about

356
00:23:50,630 --> 00:23:53,700
other eventually decided that disclosing
information

357
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:57,860
was worth the good PR I love putting
water in jail

358
00:23:57,860 --> 00:24:01,410
but you're twenty years ago was
different when their war

359
00:24:01,410 --> 00:24:06,420
successful attacks against an essay
equipment it was a hushed up when

360
00:24:06,420 --> 00:24:09,840
Chicago Tribune publish information
about

361
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:14,500
the battle in Midway that strongly
implied he broke the japanese codes

362
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:17,660
up the government was

363
00:24:17,660 --> 00:24:22,120
really pissed at the newspaper and
indicted them under the Espionage Act

364
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:26,340
and a bitch decided not to prosecute
because the damage from prosecution

365
00:24:26,340 --> 00:24:27,669
Public Prosecution

366
00:24:27,670 --> 00:24:34,670
would have been even worse

367
00:24:49,450 --> 00:24:54,809
so

368
00:24:54,809 --> 00:24:59,139
the job for an attacker's actual %uh
East job for defender they're allowed to

369
00:24:59,140 --> 00:25:00,169
do a lot of things

370
00:25:00,169 --> 00:25:04,370
defenders can they're they're allowed to
cheat they're allowed to invent new

371
00:25:04,370 --> 00:25:05,500
mathematics

372
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:09,169
their Latin that new science to to
attack the system

373
00:25:09,169 --> 00:25:12,570
they're allowed to wait a few
generations for technology to catch up

374
00:25:12,570 --> 00:25:15,600
up Bay

375
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:19,600
they only have to find one way in West
defender has to defend against

376
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:23,150
every possible attack they don't
actually have to follow

377
00:25:23,150 --> 00:25:29,610
defenders threat model if you read about
the hacks against the Japanese pachinko

378
00:25:29,610 --> 00:25:32,110
machines as a smart card to use for a

379
00:25:32,110 --> 00:25:36,169
for stored value chingo machines and

380
00:25:36,169 --> 00:25:39,770
japanese organized crime made few
hundred million dollars

381
00:25:39,770 --> 00:25:43,900
breaking them as it turns out the system
is done by Mitsubishi

382
00:25:43,900 --> 00:25:47,480
and Mitsubishi full

383
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:52,080
falsely assumed that the Pacheco parlors
were on their side

384
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:57,970
when in fact some of them were in the
employees of organized crime and if you

385
00:25:57,970 --> 00:26:00,010
look at how the system is broken

386
00:26:00,010 --> 00:26:05,500
that that mistake in the trust model is
one that was the key problems with the

387
00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:05,890
system

388
00:26:05,890 --> 00:26:10,850
so that's a threat so what what can we
do about it

389
00:26:10,850 --> 00:26:14,130
by

390
00:26:14,130 --> 00:26:17,490
I don't have to go to any this we all
know a tiger

391
00:26:17,490 --> 00:26:21,230
we can do we have encryption hash
functions public key

392
00:26:21,230 --> 00:26:24,390
digital signature schemes we can use it

393
00:26:24,390 --> 00:26:28,590
to do all these cool things privacy
commerce

394
00:26:28,590 --> 00:26:32,230
authentication Nana Peth email security

395
00:26:32,230 --> 00:26:38,210
but but

396
00:26:38,210 --> 00:26:44,690
none of them really work the ideal

397
00:26:44,690 --> 00:26:48,789
is you know days is used to protect our
passwords

398
00:26:48,789 --> 00:26:52,850
the reality is is what you see from
Microsoft the lamb and hash in their

399
00:26:52,850 --> 00:26:53,340
anti

400
00:26:53,340 --> 00:26:57,770
cash but the reality is that the system
work against

401
00:26:57,770 --> 00:27:02,370
up like a tiger be properly we have to
have backwards compatibility

402
00:27:02,370 --> 00:27:07,539
your security patches antithetical to
backwards compatibility

403
00:27:07,539 --> 00:27:11,590
and there are many systems that are
vulnerable to what we call a version

404
00:27:11,590 --> 00:27:12,159
rollback

405
00:27:12,159 --> 00:27:16,740
attack you convince the system to use an
older more insecure version of the

406
00:27:16,740 --> 00:27:17,360
protocol

407
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:21,500
my it's it's something you worry bout
against

408
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:24,730
SSL SL two verses sl3

409
00:27:24,730 --> 00:27:28,720
right implementation above at the script
agassi tools

410
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:31,809
is a lot harder than dropping them into
the product

411
00:27:31,809 --> 00:27:35,039
and you often seem a stake center and it

412
00:27:35,039 --> 00:27:38,750
elsewhere in the system now i've seen

413
00:27:38,750 --> 00:27:42,220
encryption products broken by the user
interface

414
00:27:42,220 --> 00:27:45,460
with a catastrophe was good but the user
interface

415
00:27:45,460 --> 00:27:49,890
edit flaws you know the program is
weren't talking to each other

416
00:27:49,890 --> 00:27:53,780
because really in no other discipline

417
00:27:53,780 --> 00:27:57,460
do they have to this part works that
part works

418
00:27:57,460 --> 00:28:00,640
than the sum works only in security

419
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:04,580
can you have this part working and that
hard working but putting the two of them

420
00:28:04,580 --> 00:28:05,178
together

421
00:28:05,179 --> 00:28:11,659
can break the security injured is a lot
of good crypto

422
00:28:11,659 --> 00:28:16,570
we really have all the tools we need we
just really have no idea how to use them

423
00:28:16,570 --> 00:28:17,220
properly

424
00:28:17,220 --> 00:28:21,010
and I've often said that if you give me
any

425
00:28:21,010 --> 00:28:24,210
Senate security criteria I can design

426
00:28:24,210 --> 00:28:27,830
a product that is both meets this
criteria

427
00:28:27,830 --> 00:28:31,460
and isn't secure I can do it on purpose
and Israel

428
00:28:31,460 --> 00:28:38,460
easy to do by accident so here's my list
up sort of the

429
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:43,679
other non cryptographic parts the
solution first one is trust management

430
00:28:43,679 --> 00:28:48,929
this is a really big deal and its a lot
more complicated and certificates

431
00:28:48,929 --> 00:28:53,330
and trust management is especially
fundamentally

432
00:28:53,330 --> 00:28:57,559
figuring out what your trust structure
is that you trying to mimic on computers

433
00:28:57,559 --> 00:29:01,039
and actually doing it properly without
getting any other

434
00:29:01,039 --> 00:29:06,280
trust problems and trust is a very
complex social phenomena

435
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:09,850
rate if you trust somebody to

436
00:29:09,850 --> 00:29:14,750
let them give you a lift in their car or
you lend them ten dollars

437
00:29:14,750 --> 00:29:20,200
or go into business with them or let
them babysit your children

438
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:23,210
these are very different definitions a
trust

439
00:29:23,210 --> 00:29:26,340
and right now the systems are

440
00:29:26,340 --> 00:29:29,850
rich enough to encompass them all we
have one certificate

441
00:29:29,850 --> 00:29:34,919
use for everything that makes no sense
you'll grab your wallet US many certs

442
00:29:34,919 --> 00:29:39,090
your driver's license library cards and
credit cards

443
00:29:39,090 --> 00:29:43,490
it is a real reason why visa doesn't
accept your driver's license

444
00:29:43,490 --> 00:29:47,530
even though in reality they could is no

445
00:29:47,530 --> 00:29:51,030
there's no technological reason why they
can't but they're very strong social

446
00:29:51,030 --> 00:29:51,710
regions

447
00:29:51,710 --> 00:29:55,970
white these up or for the bank must show
you the certificate

448
00:29:55,970 --> 00:30:00,540
it's being used to access their money

449
00:30:00,540 --> 00:30:05,190
and then that has to accomplish this
richness

450
00:30:05,190 --> 00:30:09,510
we need a lot more work in access
control

451
00:30:09,510 --> 00:30:12,809
sorta is a big difference between
authentication

452
00:30:12,809 --> 00:30:17,470
an authorization if I get a PGP
encryption email message

453
00:30:17,470 --> 00:30:20,840
and it says this is a purchase order for
a thousand dollars

454
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:24,919
and I validate the key and I valid
justification and

455
00:30:24,919 --> 00:30:29,299
yes it's correct so what's that doesn't
tell me anything about whether I should

456
00:30:29,299 --> 00:30:32,210
accept the purchase order

457
00:30:32,210 --> 00:30:35,580
there's a lot more richness snare there
really hasn't been

458
00:30:35,580 --> 00:30:41,480
been discussed yet

459
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:45,669
the whole notion %uh dealing with the
human computer problem

460
00:30:45,669 --> 00:30:49,850
but compete I used to say I could do if
you get it to me in

461
00:30:49,850 --> 00:30:55,780
bits I can secure it that's easy it's
very hard to move from people to bits

462
00:30:55,780 --> 00:30:59,049
that's the whole problem with passwords
passwords have to be remembered by

463
00:30:59,049 --> 00:31:00,110
people

464
00:31:00,110 --> 00:31:06,070
so they're often lousy when they turn
into bits

465
00:31:06,070 --> 00:31:10,600
so it's very hard to move between

466
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:13,750
a person and the computer

467
00:31:13,750 --> 00:31:17,340
make when I did you like physically sign
something I take my pen and write on a

468
00:31:17,340 --> 00:31:18,470
piece of paper

469
00:31:18,470 --> 00:31:23,320
allegedly sign something I tight pgp
high finesse file

470
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:26,490
I need to be able to convince a jury
that when you type

471
00:31:26,490 --> 00:31:30,320
pgp high finesse file name: that you
knew what you were doing

472
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:33,439
that you actually were signing the
documents

473
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:37,510
and that's it very hard conceptually

474
00:31:37,510 --> 00:31:41,840
%uh use a separate from the whole
human-computer interaction problems

475
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:45,789
love making the security work with
people

476
00:31:45,789 --> 00:31:49,879
right people people don't wanna see
security to test the push down on the IP

477
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:50,940
stack

478
00:31:50,940 --> 00:31:54,610
we a security professionals try to push
it up because

479
00:31:54,610 --> 00:31:57,789
it's more secure the closer it gets the
user

480
00:31:57,789 --> 00:32:01,570
but the hot if we push it up we expect
our users to make real security

481
00:32:01,570 --> 00:32:02,908
decisions

482
00:32:02,909 --> 00:32:06,809
so you expect new user when he's
browsing the web

483
00:32:06,809 --> 00:32:10,440
and he pulls up a screen that says

484
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:13,649
now a a website says click here for the
dancing pics

485
00:32:13,649 --> 00:32:16,860
any clicks in a warning comes up and
says you know this is an

486
00:32:16,860 --> 00:32:20,720
this is a dangerous job bennett my trash
your sister

487
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:24,830
the user's gonna pick dancing takes over
security every time

488
00:32:24,830 --> 00:32:28,020
he's not gone unnoticed the security
problem

489
00:32:28,020 --> 00:32:31,389
users can't make intelligent security
decisions and

490
00:32:31,389 --> 00:32:38,389
yet we expect them to

491
00:32:40,199 --> 00:32:43,239
but then we have the whole notion of
secure perimeters right

492
00:32:43,239 --> 00:32:48,359
tamper-proof smart cards computers
behind locked rooms

493
00:32:48,359 --> 00:32:53,769
as a crib toddler for a lot of my
problems are made easier if i can assume

494
00:32:53,769 --> 00:32:55,219
tamper-proof hardware

495
00:32:55,219 --> 00:32:59,099
it's a really good crotch and

496
00:32:59,099 --> 00:33:03,718
everything I've learned about tamper
resistance I speak to anybody who works

497
00:33:03,719 --> 00:33:04,279
in

498
00:33:04,279 --> 00:33:08,159
we are talking look at Sandia they do
have big tempers is a slap

499
00:33:08,159 --> 00:33:11,389
it's basically impossible just doesn't
work you can have it

500
00:33:11,389 --> 00:33:14,779
and we're building a lotta systems

501
00:33:14,779 --> 00:33:19,199
that are assuming tampers this is that
assume a secure perimeter

502
00:33:19,199 --> 00:33:23,499
and its my this last sentence is really
my belief

503
00:33:23,499 --> 00:33:27,690
any system where that

504
00:33:27,690 --> 00:33:31,129
this the device is owned by one person

505
00:33:31,129 --> 00:33:34,190
and the secrets within the device are
owned by somebody else

506
00:33:34,190 --> 00:33:38,109
is fundamentally flawed its systems
based

507
00:33:38,109 --> 00:33:45,109
that assumption just can't work

508
00:33:47,380 --> 00:33:50,360
it is the whole key escrow God

509
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:54,380
government access to your key problem
this is actually a very hard problem

510
00:33:54,380 --> 00:33:56,880
right it's very easy to keep backup

511
00:33:56,880 --> 00:34:01,210
I can design a system that has key
backup or really data recovery because

512
00:34:01,210 --> 00:34:02,760
on designing a system

513
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:07,220
with a feature that the user likes for
the users on my side

514
00:34:07,220 --> 00:34:12,710
if I'm trying to design a government
access to key system

515
00:34:12,710 --> 00:34:17,060
after the design a system that even
works in the face of a hostile user

516
00:34:17,060 --> 00:34:21,090
and that a lot harder to do and

517
00:34:21,090 --> 00:34:24,380
really with the way computers are set up
now it's it's pretty much impossible to

518
00:34:24,380 --> 00:34:29,860
do

519
00:34:29,860 --> 00:34:33,150
the the most powerful security we truly
have his relationships

520
00:34:33,150 --> 00:34:37,460
me to look a lot %uh systems out there
that are really pretty mediocre

521
00:34:37,460 --> 00:34:41,830
and survive because the base in
relationships credit cards are a great

522
00:34:41,830 --> 00:34:42,790
example

523
00:34:42,790 --> 00:34:47,560
it you know there are a lot of ways to a

524
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:51,239
tax credit cards but credit card
companies rely on the fact

525
00:34:51,240 --> 00:34:54,540
that they got your name and address they
know who you are

526
00:34:54,540 --> 00:34:57,779
if you call up any dispute a transaction

527
00:34:57,780 --> 00:35:01,730
they'll say and don't worry about it we
will take it off your bill

528
00:35:01,730 --> 00:35:05,760
you do that four times five times the
kick your system we don't want your

529
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:06,370
business

530
00:35:06,370 --> 00:35:10,020
so for them it is cheaper

531
00:35:10,020 --> 00:35:13,520
to rely on a relationship that is to
investigate whatever the fraud is

532
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:16,940
a lot case %uh

533
00:35:16,940 --> 00:35:20,030
the so the upshot about this is that

534
00:35:20,030 --> 00:35:24,040
I don't really believe there's much
future anonymous commerce systems

535
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:27,580
I think the liabilities are much greater
and

536
00:35:27,580 --> 00:35:30,840
there's no real reason for an
institution to accept those liabilities

537
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:33,920
cassese's but based on relationships are
much

538
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:40,920
easier to police and finally there's
there's the testing problems

539
00:35:41,350 --> 00:35:46,339
and this is really a big deal but flaws
in systems can be anywhere

540
00:35:46,340 --> 00:35:50,660
they can be in threat model the design
the implementation the interface

541
00:35:50,660 --> 00:35:54,540
you could have in secure interactions

542
00:35:54,540 --> 00:35:58,430
up these flaws are very common

543
00:35:58,430 --> 00:36:03,580
and they're invisible if I was building
a word processor I want to know if it

544
00:36:03,580 --> 00:36:07,360
printed I would just test the print
function and if it worked I would know

545
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:08,370
would print properly

546
00:36:08,370 --> 00:36:12,040
I find building a a descriptor

547
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:16,110
i contested encrypts and decrypts
properly I have no idea whether it's a

548
00:36:16,110 --> 00:36:16,890
cure or not

549
00:36:16,890 --> 00:36:20,470
no one mounted beta testing can

550
00:36:20,470 --> 00:36:24,360
uncover a security flaw you need testing

551
00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:27,880
by like people like you guys by people
who know what they're doing

552
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:32,870
and is no such thing as a comprehensive
security checklist

553
00:36:32,870 --> 00:36:36,040
and often the only

554
00:36:36,040 --> 00:36:39,610
feedback as to whether system is good or
not is

555
00:36:39,610 --> 00:36:46,610
is when when you guys a publishes an
attack

556
00:36:49,050 --> 00:36:52,220
so I often get systems to out to examine

557
00:36:52,220 --> 00:36:56,790
and and the problem is it's really easy
to test for any given weakness

558
00:36:56,790 --> 00:37:00,180
%ah it's probably

559
00:37:00,180 --> 00:37:05,259
now I guess possible today to detect to
look for all

560
00:37:05,260 --> 00:37:08,369
known weaknesses will take a long time
it is

561
00:37:08,369 --> 00:37:11,369
impossible today to test for

562
00:37:11,369 --> 00:37:14,820
every possible weakness because there
are always two witnesses you don't know

563
00:37:14,820 --> 00:37:15,410
about

564
00:37:15,410 --> 00:37:20,040
now the new thing especially for
commerce systems

565
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:23,560
is that they don't have to be perfect
you look at credit card to look at

566
00:37:23,560 --> 00:37:24,650
checks you look at

567
00:37:24,650 --> 00:37:28,750
the notary public system in diesem
moronic systems for security

568
00:37:28,750 --> 00:37:32,740
but they're good enough often it's a
matter of

569
00:37:32,740 --> 00:37:39,740
up dealing with a liabilities

570
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:46,970
right couple slides on on to the the
needs for a

571
00:37:46,970 --> 00:37:52,120
for retirement security most people
don't need long-term security

572
00:37:52,120 --> 00:37:57,420
especially business data mailing lists
are optionally after a year

573
00:37:57,420 --> 00:38:02,230
you know negotiations are obsolete after
two weeks or three weeks or a month

574
00:38:02,230 --> 00:38:07,370
product research the year two years of
even five year plans are obviously after

575
00:38:07,370 --> 00:38:08,170
six months

576
00:38:08,170 --> 00:38:12,010
but there's no real there are very few
business things are

577
00:38:12,010 --> 00:38:17,240
choir multi-year security the big
examples are embarrassments

578
00:38:17,240 --> 00:38:20,750
I businesses would like to keep their

579
00:38:20,750 --> 00:38:25,160
0 less than legal activities quiet for a
long time

580
00:38:25,160 --> 00:38:32,160
of people would like to keep their
personal life quiet for a long time

581
00:38:39,019 --> 00:38:42,529
there are needs for strong
authentication authentication is really

582
00:38:42,529 --> 00:38:44,239
depend on the value the transaction

583
00:38:44,239 --> 00:38:48,289
what is an authentic a day the
authentication you need for a library

584
00:38:48,289 --> 00:38:50,209
card might be a lot less than

585
00:38:50,209 --> 00:38:53,890
for a card use to now to check to take
up

586
00:38:53,890 --> 00:39:00,029
Karzai to rent a lot the authentication
needed for a are stored value card that

587
00:39:00,029 --> 00:39:00,609
you get

588
00:39:00,609 --> 00:39:04,799
up no photocopies and Kinkos is a lot
less than

589
00:39:04,799 --> 00:39:07,999
stored value card I have a couple
thousand dollars on a

590
00:39:07,999 --> 00:39:14,999
and those are a lot less authentication
you need like to buy a house

591
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:25,759
K little bit about the future so here
things I think

592
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:29,280
we should watch on the street for terms
a security

593
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:33,410
the first one is tempers essence I would
love it if they would have real tamper

594
00:39:33,410 --> 00:39:34,040
resistance

595
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:37,099
it'll really make my job easier so work
on

596
00:39:37,099 --> 00:39:41,839
I'd love it if we had good biometrics
right now

597
00:39:41,839 --> 00:39:46,180
a biometrics is being touted as a
solution to a lot of problems

598
00:39:46,180 --> 00:39:50,419
it really isn't yes a fingerprint is a
good

599
00:39:50,420 --> 00:39:53,900
token that people carry around them all
the time

600
00:39:53,900 --> 00:39:58,450
but its too easy to steal and once you
steal it

601
00:39:58,450 --> 00:40:02,440
it's impossible to update so you're
people walking around with

602
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:05,440
10 keys if they lose the mall what
happens

603
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:10,640
by if you put your thumb print down an
appeal West terminal

604
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:14,500
you have to assume that p.o.s terminal
is not on your side

605
00:40:14,500 --> 00:40:18,480
see you are giving out your fingerprint
pretty much anybody who asks

606
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:25,480
that doesn't work for security now we're
starting to see some

607
00:40:27,020 --> 00:40:32,520
some real good work in trust management
the STS ID SPK I initiatives

608
00:40:32,520 --> 00:40:36,069
worth looking at dealing with how
trustees

609
00:40:36,069 --> 00:40:40,000
given how was transferred how to store
trust hydea

610
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:43,400
how to use it how to revoke trust

611
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:50,400
very hard thing to do in computers we
need to watch the internet standards

612
00:40:50,740 --> 00:40:54,430
I root for some of them are high hopes
for others

613
00:40:54,430 --> 00:41:00,569
I'd like to see some real good work in
human-computer interface

614
00:41:00,569 --> 00:41:05,319
ways to make computers fish security
work for people

615
00:41:05,319 --> 00:41:08,750
to be indebted in what they do so it's
easy

616
00:41:08,750 --> 00:41:13,400
so now looking at the way pgp works with
Utah right now

617
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:16,400
it's really nice to see a good user
interface

618
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:21,359
which easier get the message where it's
it's harder not to encrypt then is to

619
00:41:21,359 --> 00:41:21,848
encrypt

620
00:41:21,849 --> 00:41:28,099
that's when you know you've won up keep
watching a legal infrastructure

621
00:41:28,099 --> 00:41:33,190
fundamentally we have to assume that the
tech can't do everything

622
00:41:33,190 --> 00:41:38,000
the guy said in apply catastrophe that
we need to protect ourselves

623
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:42,309
not laws but with mathematics that
sounds good but it's actually pretty

624
00:41:42,309 --> 00:41:43,079
naive

625
00:41:43,079 --> 00:41:47,640
we can protect ourselves mathematics
because we don't work in

626
00:41:47,640 --> 00:41:50,710
in the world the mathematics we work in
the world of computers

627
00:41:50,710 --> 00:41:56,160
and people and and interactions so the
math is over here

628
00:41:56,160 --> 00:42:01,200
the math is perfect the computers a
mediocre the networks are lousy

629
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:04,910
people are just awful so

630
00:42:04,910 --> 00:42:09,089
I need a legal system to deal with

631
00:42:09,089 --> 00:42:14,220
the fraud and the attacks at are
inevitable against any complex system I

632
00:42:14,220 --> 00:42:16,180
can build a copy protection

633
00:42:16,180 --> 00:42:19,750
system for for DVD back in stock

634
00:42:19,750 --> 00:42:22,880
grandma from buying one copy Little
Mermaid and

635
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:27,720
making copies for our grandchildren I
can feel the system that'll stop

636
00:42:27,720 --> 00:42:33,510
the taiwanese hackers from pirating any
legal system to prevent

637
00:42:33,510 --> 00:42:39,109
stop those attacks and yeah we're seeing
some stuff we're seeing some digital

638
00:42:39,109 --> 00:42:40,130
signature axe

639
00:42:40,130 --> 00:42:43,950
which trying to get digital signatures
the force of law something a pretty

640
00:42:43,950 --> 00:42:44,530
silly

641
00:42:44,530 --> 00:42:49,020
something or better if you want to know
how this a shakeout it's worth

642
00:42:49,020 --> 00:42:52,490
reading historia I'll the typewriter

643
00:42:52,490 --> 00:42:56,270
and when the typewriter was first used
for contracts and what a typewritten

644
00:42:56,270 --> 00:42:57,940
contract men first-hand

645
00:42:57,940 --> 00:43:02,579
contract this biz like the twenty years
a case laws that was sorted out

646
00:43:02,579 --> 00:43:06,480
and you can see similar stuff with
electronic contract electronic

647
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:07,230
signatures

648
00:43:07,230 --> 00:43:12,049
but we need legal infrastructures for
electronic commerce

649
00:43:12,049 --> 00:43:18,200
or just what happened and weenie
criminal statutes to print to prosecute

650
00:43:18,200 --> 00:43:19,119
digital criminals

651
00:43:19,119 --> 00:43:23,890
personally I like laws at the tech
largely invariant

652
00:43:23,890 --> 00:43:28,230
because technologies is just moving too
quickly now

653
00:43:28,230 --> 00:43:32,660
for law stick laws to catch up we need
to write laws that are in a kind of

654
00:43:32,660 --> 00:43:39,310
technology and we'll see to solve this
silly our government talking nonsense

655
00:43:39,310 --> 00:43:45,380
its gonna go way in 10 years just but

656
00:43:45,380 --> 00:43:49,569
soon the sooner it does the better

657
00:43:49,569 --> 00:43:53,430
and finally there's some cool best
photography is worth paying attention to

658
00:43:53,430 --> 00:43:58,009
on justice finally replacing Dez

659
00:43:58,010 --> 00:44:02,200
they're gonna put out a call for
algorithms and last few months until the

660
00:44:02,200 --> 00:44:03,880
about a two year period

661
00:44:03,880 --> 00:44:07,339
where people submit algorithms ill be
evaluated

662
00:44:07,339 --> 00:44:10,859
I my website has information on that
people Russian following its

663
00:44:10,859 --> 00:44:14,619
this like a pretty exciting me it's fun

664
00:44:14,619 --> 00:44:17,799
really want to protect security much but
it's me

665
00:44:17,799 --> 00:44:20,970
and and and we like it

666
00:44:20,970 --> 00:44:25,450
%uh elliptic curve cryptography is worth
following I'm not a big fan of it but a

667
00:44:25,450 --> 00:44:27,930
lot of people are

668
00:44:27,930 --> 00:44:30,720
is anybody hear from Sir come in the
audience every time I say that I get a

669
00:44:30,720 --> 00:44:32,369
phone call from Circa

670
00:44:32,369 --> 00:44:36,569
stone tell them I said that

671
00:44:36,569 --> 00:44:40,690
me quantum cryptography is

672
00:44:40,690 --> 00:44:43,790
it's getting its moving out of a lunatic
fringe

673
00:44:43,790 --> 00:44:46,970
faster than I thought

674
00:44:46,970 --> 00:44:50,810
by British Telecom is actually done
quantum key exchange

675
00:44:50,810 --> 00:44:53,839
over a 10-kilometer fiber-optic link

676
00:44:53,839 --> 00:44:57,440
its kinda neat and this sort of has a
potential

677
00:44:57,440 --> 00:45:02,140
making and most of my book obsolete

678
00:45:02,140 --> 00:45:06,990
there's a new attacks its kinda attack
is kinda neat because we see advances in

679
00:45:06,990 --> 00:45:09,740
a lot of different fronts racy more
computers

680
00:45:09,740 --> 00:45:13,260
so distributed attacks work better you
see faster computers

681
00:45:13,260 --> 00:45:16,829
so any attack works better you see %uh

682
00:45:16,829 --> 00:45:21,040
tweaking up the computation to get a
factor two factors three factor 5

683
00:45:21,040 --> 00:45:22,730
improvement on attacks

684
00:45:22,730 --> 00:45:27,310
and then finally you see fundamental
advances cryptanalysis

685
00:45:27,310 --> 00:45:32,270
if you watch a factoring attacks against
our essay

686
00:45:32,270 --> 00:45:37,200
and you see how they creep up they take
advantage all those four things

687
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:41,170
and attacks that now ten years ago we
thought would never happen are now

688
00:45:41,170 --> 00:45:43,109
feasible

689
00:45:43,109 --> 00:45:46,900
and ten years from now who knows what'll
happen

690
00:45:46,900 --> 00:45:50,349
up quantum cryptanalysis which is
actually still really on the lunatic

691
00:45:50,349 --> 00:45:51,200
fringe

692
00:45:51,200 --> 00:45:56,200
and that some that quantum factoring
stuff sorta Honda

693
00:45:56,200 --> 00:46:00,819
quantum computer was invented and no one
knew what to do with it

694
00:46:00,819 --> 00:46:03,589
and the first two things do you figure
out what to do with a quantum computer

695
00:46:03,589 --> 00:46:04,810
was

696
00:46:04,810 --> 00:46:07,940
break our essay and then break

697
00:46:07,940 --> 00:46:11,480
el-gamal so

698
00:46:11,480 --> 00:46:16,270
this is really on the lunatic fringe no
one has a clue how to make this work but

699
00:46:16,270 --> 00:46:19,549
in our lifetime is possible that we
could leave

700
00:46:19,549 --> 00:46:23,579
in the post public key cryptography here

701
00:46:23,579 --> 00:46:30,579
and that require some thought

702
00:46:32,420 --> 00:46:37,320
so a couple conclusions at the problem
with bad cryptography is a looks exactly

703
00:46:37,320 --> 00:46:39,100
the same as good cryptography

704
00:46:39,100 --> 00:46:42,250
both a bad product and a good product

705
00:46:42,250 --> 00:46:47,920
will say we use triple this and there's
really no way for most people tell the

706
00:46:47,920 --> 00:46:48,580
difference

707
00:46:48,580 --> 00:46:51,830
unfortunately

708
00:46:51,830 --> 00:46:55,410
successful attacks are often kept secret
and

709
00:46:55,410 --> 00:46:59,779
this is really bad if you want to design
aircraft

710
00:46:59,780 --> 00:47:03,200
you could walk into the FAA offices and
read about

711
00:47:03,200 --> 00:47:08,120
every airline accident from the mid
thirties until today

712
00:47:08,120 --> 00:47:11,500
you could learn from all other mistakes
everybody else may

713
00:47:11,500 --> 00:47:15,130
you can't do that with computer security

714
00:47:15,130 --> 00:47:18,750
when there's an attack its it often kept
secret

715
00:47:18,750 --> 00:47:22,530
if like the the rushing attack against
citibank

716
00:47:22,530 --> 00:47:27,080
it's made public we don't get any
details we don't know how the attackers

717
00:47:27,080 --> 00:47:27,700
broke in

718
00:47:27,700 --> 00:47:31,660
what they did what the mistakes were how
we can make our sis is better for next

719
00:47:31,660 --> 00:47:32,170
time

720
00:47:32,170 --> 00:47:36,370
up attackers need to publicize

721
00:47:36,370 --> 00:47:40,870
so I like it when people publicize
because we all can learn from it

722
00:47:40,870 --> 00:47:45,200
and more importantly we need to be
proactive

723
00:47:45,200 --> 00:47:48,720
in designing systems me to understand
the real threats

724
00:47:48,720 --> 00:47:51,800
Design Systems crypto built-in from the
beginning

725
00:47:51,800 --> 00:47:55,550
are build systems that scale to
reasonable levels

726
00:47:55,550 --> 00:47:59,290
up we don't need perfect solutions

727
00:47:59,290 --> 00:48:04,250
but we need solutions where the disaster
conditions are an exponential

728
00:48:04,250 --> 00:48:07,270
Mike I don't care if one person

729
00:48:07,270 --> 00:48:12,670
can break assist but if they can post on
the net how everybody can break a system

730
00:48:12,670 --> 00:48:19,020
that's bad right it's prudent to prepare
for the worst

731
00:48:19,020 --> 00:48:23,530
you build the system today as successful
you're stuck with it for twenty years

732
00:48:23,530 --> 00:48:28,730
we're still stuck with lamb and is no
excuse for that

733
00:48:28,730 --> 00:48:31,940
kinda bad security to be around for so
long

734
00:48:31,940 --> 00:48:36,790
but now cellular phones we're still
stuck with them

735
00:48:36,790 --> 00:48:40,000
all the mistakes and digital sailor
we'll be stuck with them

736
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:44,900
for another 20 years and answer finally

737
00:48:44,900 --> 00:48:48,510
the social problems are a lot harder
than the mathematics

738
00:48:48,510 --> 00:48:53,340
the mathematics I Conseil the proper
social engineering problems

739
00:48:53,340 --> 00:48:57,590
I really can't and as a final quote

740
00:48:57,590 --> 00:49:01,850
%uh discloses either Robert Morris

741
00:49:01,850 --> 00:49:06,580
or its a Roger Needham they both seem to
attribute it to each other

742
00:49:06,580 --> 00:49:10,790
and its if you think a photography can
solve your problem

743
00:49:10,790 --> 00:49:13,870
and you'd understand your problem and
Udonis tanker doctor

744
00:49:13,870 --> 00:49:20,870
and I'll take questions

745
00:49:29,140 --> 00:49:31,980
yeah I just wanted to let me put this up
again I'll

746
00:49:31,980 --> 00:49:35,270
there's the the email address you want
copies of the slides

747
00:49:35,270 --> 00:49:39,750
and web site for just more generic
information you refer to something

748
00:49:39,750 --> 00:49:40,510
called Quantum

749
00:49:40,510 --> 00:49:44,589
for top photography a few times what
exactly is it

750
00:49:44,589 --> 00:49:48,440
get a couple since our club photographer
basically what week

751
00:49:48,440 --> 00:49:51,800
quantum mechanics is kind because I can
tell

752
00:49:51,800 --> 00:49:56,220
physically if somebody tampers with my
communication channel %uh

753
00:49:56,220 --> 00:50:00,380
when the fundamental precept quantum
mechanics is if you observe

754
00:50:00,380 --> 00:50:03,720
up a particle you disturbance

755
00:50:03,720 --> 00:50:07,440
so I'm gonna use that property to send
the bitstream

756
00:50:07,440 --> 00:50:11,190
I'll other key and I know if it's been
disturbed

757
00:50:11,190 --> 00:50:15,720
that someone's been eavesdropping so I
leverage the fact that

758
00:50:15,720 --> 00:50:19,960
quantum mechanics can tell me absolutely
if there's been any drop

759
00:50:19,960 --> 00:50:23,690
and there are a lot of protocols that
leverage that

760
00:50:23,690 --> 00:50:30,530
into key generation

761
00:50:30,530 --> 00:50:34,240
question what's neat about there was
need about is is unlike any other system

762
00:50:34,240 --> 00:50:36,330
is not based on the mathematical
assumptions

763
00:50:36,330 --> 00:50:40,640
what so offbeat about its it's really
kinda weird

764
00:50:40,640 --> 00:50:45,220
somebody can actually use it

765
00:50:45,220 --> 00:50:48,580
it still requires me lasers in a lot of
equipment it's not it's not gonna be

766
00:50:48,580 --> 00:50:51,890
fielding your PC anytime soon so

767
00:50:51,890 --> 00:50:55,450
it's very much a laboratory technology
said even close to being field

768
00:50:55,450 --> 00:51:01,859
question

769
00:51:01,859 --> 00:51:07,000
regarding well first just I wanted a
state

770
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:10,230
I'm really amazed by the fact that I
guess maybe even two years ago you

771
00:51:10,230 --> 00:51:12,089
couldn't find up like a tiger

772
00:51:12,089 --> 00:51:15,759
the in a bookstore everywhere anywhere
and now it's all over the place which i

773
00:51:15,760 --> 00:51:16,310
think is

774
00:51:16,310 --> 00:51:20,900
a great thing for the people who are
trying to learn in a great thing for the

775
00:51:20,900 --> 00:51:21,220
people

776
00:51:21,220 --> 00:51:24,609
want to protect themselves and I after
having

777
00:51:24,609 --> 00:51:29,810
read it I why to say that I think
publishing that book is a great for

778
00:51:29,810 --> 00:51:30,430
anybody

779
00:51:30,430 --> 00:51:35,089
is concerned with security and the facil

780
00:51:35,089 --> 00:51:39,549
vacillation being able to get it is an
amazing thing my question is

781
00:51:39,550 --> 00:51:46,160
I and led understand I might understand
by

782
00:51:46,160 --> 00:51:49,990
some by of mathematician friends of
which I have quite a few

783
00:51:49,990 --> 00:51:54,650
up that about six months ago somebody
came up with

784
00:51:54,650 --> 00:51:59,940
a.m. an approximate solution 2 TSP

785
00:51:59,940 --> 00:52:03,390
in log n time and

786
00:52:03,390 --> 00:52:08,598
it was it was a is an approximation I

787
00:52:08,599 --> 00:52:12,109
but the apparently the point is that
they try to implement it and

788
00:52:12,109 --> 00:52:15,980
the was such a bad writer in such a
badly written paper in such a

789
00:52:15,980 --> 00:52:16,609
complicated

790
00:52:16,609 --> 00:52:20,080
theory that nobody was able to release
track anything from it but

791
00:52:20,080 --> 00:52:23,910
I'm not sure if you're familiar with
that development

792
00:52:23,910 --> 00:52:27,770
and if you're if you're not you feel
that that kind of solution would have

793
00:52:27,770 --> 00:52:30,770
impact on say

794
00:52:30,770 --> 00:52:33,890
zero-knowledge proofs and

795
00:52:33,890 --> 00:52:37,029
various other protocols to describe in
your book

796
00:52:37,030 --> 00:52:41,720
it's interesting I'm not familiar with
the work %uh it could happen if it could

797
00:52:41,720 --> 00:52:42,890
have a serious effect

798
00:52:42,890 --> 00:52:47,310
so are the odd things you learn mission
to encrypt %ah graffiti

799
00:52:47,310 --> 00:52:51,450
is that things affect your security from
weird angles

800
00:52:51,450 --> 00:52:56,359
so stuff that doesn't seem like it's
important ends up being important

801
00:52:56,359 --> 00:53:01,210
stuff that looks really important ends
up not I'd be interested in seeing the

802
00:53:01,210 --> 00:53:01,690
work

803
00:53:01,690 --> 00:53:04,980
and the answers

804
00:53:04,980 --> 00:53:08,599
the answer this question is always maybe
or leased it depends

805
00:53:08,599 --> 00:53:13,000
is it true that

806
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:16,150
you to pass a law that makes pgp
signatures

807
00:53:16,150 --> 00:53:19,790
legally binding who wooded you to

808
00:53:19,790 --> 00:53:23,349
naw Utah Utah's wanted this spider

809
00:53:23,349 --> 00:53:27,109
thirteen states that have something
called digital signature act

810
00:53:27,109 --> 00:53:30,330
which is an attempt to give digital
signatures

811
00:53:30,330 --> 00:53:36,069
some legal standing PCP is actually not
mention in fact X 509

812
00:53:36,070 --> 00:53:40,859
mentioned you top statue almost the
other statues are following

813
00:53:40,859 --> 00:53:44,279
the the guidelines

814
00:53:44,280 --> 00:53:47,880
by 0 things the

815
00:53:47,880 --> 00:53:52,859
the ABA and they're trying to be
technologically neutral

816
00:53:52,859 --> 00:53:56,160
up right now no

817
00:53:56,160 --> 00:53:59,890
you can just normal digital signatures
are not legally binding

818
00:53:59,890 --> 00:54:03,259
but their protocols you can go through
to make them legally binding

819
00:54:03,260 --> 00:54:07,010
so if you're a company also accept
digital purchase orders

820
00:54:07,010 --> 00:54:11,089
you in your our customers go through a
paper protocol

821
00:54:11,089 --> 00:54:14,839
that would say look we agree that we're
gonna uses digital signatures

822
00:54:14,839 --> 00:54:19,099
this'll all this is all in flux

823
00:54:19,099 --> 00:54:23,680
now assume that in the next five years
missing a lot more digital signatures

824
00:54:23,680 --> 00:54:29,290
in real courtrooms yes for a second
dying to know your opinion

825
00:54:29,290 --> 00:54:33,720
pgp 5.0 in particular any significant
weaknesses in the Elkins

826
00:54:33,720 --> 00:54:37,010
questions about pgp 5.0 and likely I can

827
00:54:37,010 --> 00:54:40,420
docket by saying I don't have one yet
okay

828
00:54:40,420 --> 00:54:43,540
more generically I and the real world is

829
00:54:43,540 --> 00:54:47,300
diffie-hellman L Melky more secure than
Rs a key

830
00:54:47,300 --> 00:54:50,540
%uh no to a first approximation

831
00:54:50,540 --> 00:54:53,770
all the public key elements are
basically the same it's a question of

832
00:54:53,770 --> 00:54:55,290
what he likes or equivalent

833
00:54:55,290 --> 00:54:58,460
diffie-hellman alcohol is really the
same as our essay

834
00:54:58,460 --> 00:55:01,990
not one is not more secure than the
other remember if your gonna break a

835
00:55:01,990 --> 00:55:05,990
product that uses diffie-hellman RRS say
anything that you're not gonna break the

836
00:55:05,990 --> 00:55:08,230
man if you want to attack

837
00:55:08,230 --> 00:55:11,280
pgp gun attack trust mile

838
00:55:11,280 --> 00:55:14,470
there's a PGP key out there with my name
on it

839
00:55:14,470 --> 00:55:18,010
it's not mine I get missus acquitted all
the time

840
00:55:18,010 --> 00:55:21,060
I I can't seem to get it all of the
servers

841
00:55:21,060 --> 00:55:24,779
your vocal comes back you want to attack
some body

842
00:55:24,780 --> 00:55:28,420
make a new PGP key put in their name
posted on the servers

843
00:55:28,420 --> 00:55:31,690
you'll get their secret male

844
00:55:31,690 --> 00:55:34,950
you not going to attack mathematics
mathematics is fine

845
00:55:34,950 --> 00:55:39,560
you going to attack the trust model
you'll make a bogus copy a PGP

846
00:55:39,560 --> 00:55:43,609
and get it on someone else's computer
nobody checks to make sure that the

847
00:55:43,609 --> 00:55:47,250
the build is correct go to the servers
you can put a Trojan horse

848
00:55:47,250 --> 00:55:52,260
pgp those all those attacks have nothing
to do with PGP

849
00:55:52,260 --> 00:55:57,069
pgp could be perfect but it only perfect
in that very narrow area

850
00:55:57,069 --> 00:56:01,910
other crypt in the email and you want to
attack a system like that

851
00:56:01,910 --> 00:56:05,480
attack on the fringes what happened to
our three lakes

852
00:56:05,480 --> 00:56:09,339
or a C been broken already have what two
out of three lakes

853
00:56:09,339 --> 00:56:12,540
or SAT in already what are the legs are
saying

854
00:56:12,540 --> 00:56:16,319
I was told by pgp person I spoke to

855
00:56:16,319 --> 00:56:21,279
three phases RS now now pgp to Companies
House they do propaganda to

856
00:56:21,280 --> 00:56:28,280
pretty good propaganda

857
00:56:31,230 --> 00:56:33,940
this has something do it just said

858
00:56:33,940 --> 00:56:38,800
I know its key lengths

859
00:56:38,800 --> 00:56:43,640
the RCR have been cracked what is the
current state security a

860
00:56:43,640 --> 00:56:48,180
pgp assuming that the complete trust
model is

861
00:56:48,180 --> 00:56:52,490
I think I think PGP is applied 2008 keys

862
00:56:52,490 --> 00:56:55,510
4,000 yeah mean

863
00:56:55,510 --> 00:56:58,720
they're breaking a three-ring changed
its now

864
00:56:58,720 --> 00:57:01,860
and probably 512 the next one type its

865
00:57:01,860 --> 00:57:05,690
and five television x 12 fall some
answers its

866
00:57:05,690 --> 00:57:09,870
mathematically PGP is fine nobody will
break the PGP mathematics

867
00:57:09,870 --> 00:57:13,259
probably me Yale

868
00:57:13,260 --> 00:57:16,300
the attack something else is the code
perfect

869
00:57:16,300 --> 00:57:20,600
I don't know it's been looked at by a
lot of people at public colleges almost

870
00:57:20,600 --> 00:57:20,990
by

871
00:57:20,990 --> 00:57:24,930
definition safer than private code more
people get to look at

872
00:57:24,930 --> 00:57:29,820
pgp has been a big target a lot of
hackers latah Creek to people

873
00:57:29,820 --> 00:57:33,700
have studied it together better sense of

874
00:57:33,700 --> 00:57:39,870
I've relief that haven't found anything
now no I wouldn't worry about the map

875
00:57:39,870 --> 00:57:42,710
people look at key lengths are really
missing the point

876
00:57:42,710 --> 00:57:46,740
I get very frustrated at companies that
talk to me about

877
00:57:46,740 --> 00:57:51,040
that Xilinx like that's the only measure
of security key like this use because

878
00:57:51,040 --> 00:57:52,259
it's easy to measure

879
00:57:52,260 --> 00:57:56,170
it's easy to quote looks good in a press
release that's good news article

880
00:57:56,170 --> 00:58:02,050
Xilinx is now key like this how good the
lock on your front door is

881
00:58:02,050 --> 00:58:05,050
like I don't know your front door lock
works there are 5 pins

882
00:58:05,050 --> 00:58:09,010
and each pin is ten positions so you are
the key links above

883
00:58:09,010 --> 00:58:12,690
of 10,000 if someone went to you and
said okay

884
00:58:12,690 --> 00:58:16,520
here's a better front door lock it has 7
pins were 12 positions each

885
00:58:16,520 --> 00:58:20,240
you can install it but it doesn't make
you any more secure

886
00:58:20,240 --> 00:58:23,360
as as I think about that your windows
says nothing about

887
00:58:23,360 --> 00:58:28,260
knocking down your door there are a
bunch of parties in California that

888
00:58:28,260 --> 00:58:28,740
woulda

889
00:58:28,740 --> 00:58:33,190
would go with take a chainsaw and cut
through their a

890
00:58:33,190 --> 00:58:38,420
their targets wall to get into the house
this a beautiful attack just ignores the

891
00:58:38,420 --> 00:58:41,480
threat model not even an alarm system
notice that

892
00:58:41,480 --> 00:58:45,510
brute forcing the key is

893
00:58:45,510 --> 00:58:52,510
is is not the attack people are gonna do
I think I'll take these two questions

894
00:58:52,540 --> 00:58:54,759
and get off the stage since it's
probably about time

895
00:58:54,760 --> 00:58:59,170
my question is

896
00:58:59,170 --> 00:59:03,370
with the recent brute force days do you
think that

897
00:59:03,370 --> 00:59:06,690
days you know the use of the usable
lifetime days is

898
00:59:06,690 --> 00:59:10,000
over or do you think there's some space
for session crypto

899
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:13,430
or you know other kinda short Life
Technologies

900
00:59:13,430 --> 00:59:18,670
again take is is chemist can adjust the
key length for a sign applications

901
00:59:18,670 --> 00:59:23,540
days was never secure for some
applications these a lifetime Dez was

902
00:59:23,540 --> 00:59:24,640
over five years ago

903
00:59:24,640 --> 00:59:28,500
if I'm gonna change my key every OPP
packets

904
00:59:28,500 --> 00:59:32,850
this is probably good enough if I don't
have

905
00:59:32,850 --> 00:59:37,240
very high-value stuff on securing this
is probably good enough

906
00:59:37,240 --> 00:59:41,080
if I a smart card is used like any other
than the machine

907
00:59:41,080 --> 00:59:46,160
dazzle work so it it depends on it's not
just the key link

908
00:59:46,160 --> 00:59:49,660
it really is the application what it's
being used for

909
00:59:49,660 --> 00:59:52,790
I'll who the attack adversaries are

910
00:59:52,790 --> 00:59:56,620
what the value of the data is how long
that has to be secure

911
00:59:56,620 --> 00:59:59,750
I can take pretty much any algorithm and

912
00:59:59,750 --> 01:00:05,440
make it secure by using it in a certain
way I could if I change my case my desk

913
01:00:05,440 --> 01:00:06,570
e often enough

914
01:00:06,570 --> 01:00:09,690
I can make it so you can't put force a
message

915
01:00:09,690 --> 01:00:14,930
by all you do pgp you I have a separate
is key for each

916
01:00:14,930 --> 01:00:17,990
eight bytes the message do it that way
net you done

917
01:00:17,990 --> 01:00:21,500
that works just fine really

918
01:00:21,500 --> 01:00:25,220
the nice thing about the braking is it
was a a good public example

919
01:00:25,220 --> 01:00:28,390
applied as a small half before rival

920
01:00:28,390 --> 01:00:31,910
I guess my get im my real question is if
if you have a

921
01:00:31,910 --> 01:00:35,319
an application where you need your
long-term security

922
01:00:35,320 --> 01:00:38,640
I don't know I don't recommend as
anymore for any applications

923
01:00:38,640 --> 01:00:44,170
is no real reason it is not terribly
fast not terribly secure not terribly

924
01:00:44,170 --> 01:00:44,810
efficient

925
01:00:44,810 --> 01:00:51,810
either in code size R and gate count

926
01:00:54,830 --> 01:00:58,299
what r over them with you would you
recommend for

927
01:00:58,300 --> 01:01:01,570
a yes idea or now

928
01:01:01,570 --> 01:01:05,240
as: gonna require larger blocksize
there'll be a bunch of things

929
01:01:05,240 --> 01:01:09,340
its is never simple as one out my hope
is that a yes I'll be a family

930
01:01:09,340 --> 01:01:09,910
algorithms

931
01:01:09,910 --> 01:01:14,500
something I learned in designing things
is always something has to be optimized

932
01:01:14,500 --> 01:01:18,650
someone wants locate count someone wants
low latency someone once

933
01:01:18,650 --> 01:01:22,320
faster fasten crips run crispy

934
01:01:22,320 --> 01:01:26,609
software someone has hardware and one
sufficiency and hardware

935
01:01:26,609 --> 01:01:30,500
one thing isn't enough and this is the
last question

936
01:01:30,500 --> 01:01:33,660
given that you think the masses good
enough

937
01:01:33,660 --> 01:01:36,790
and emphasis should be placed on trust
models

938
01:01:36,790 --> 01:01:40,259
and user interface for person to person
communication

939
01:01:40,260 --> 01:01:44,010
do you have a favor trust model or user
interface improvements

940
01:01:44,010 --> 01:01:48,280
you'd like to suggest something like a a
Web of Trust purses a centralized

941
01:01:48,280 --> 01:01:52,099
trust person to person communications
really the easiest

942
01:01:52,099 --> 01:01:56,869
so you know we can do that one way to
look at

943
01:01:56,869 --> 01:02:00,520
look at clear security is computer
security sorta

944
01:02:00,520 --> 01:02:04,089
perverts the natural trust model of the
system

945
01:02:04,089 --> 01:02:09,380
at the natural order of the computer is
everybody can look at everything so

946
01:02:09,380 --> 01:02:12,980
the more I change that the hardest to do

947
01:02:12,980 --> 01:02:17,160
so hard to make it to one person can
look at everything that's not that hard

948
01:02:17,160 --> 01:02:19,920
i cant protecting the password to make
it so that

949
01:02:19,920 --> 01:02:23,520
the sender and the receiver can look at
everything as a little bit harder

950
01:02:23,520 --> 01:02:26,940
Tim to segment it so that multiple
people to look at their own pieces

951
01:02:26,940 --> 01:02:30,480
that's a little harder to make a system
so that the sender

952
01:02:30,480 --> 01:02:33,480
and their seaver can look at something
in the government can if they have a

953
01:02:33,480 --> 01:02:35,270
warrant but they can't if they don't

954
01:02:35,270 --> 01:02:38,660
and the system works even in the face of
dial service

955
01:02:38,660 --> 01:02:43,779
that's even harder so when I'm looking
at trust models and usability

956
01:02:43,780 --> 01:02:47,500
I'm usually not looking at Point to
Point point2 points easy i'm looking at

957
01:02:47,500 --> 01:02:48,300
the real sis

958
01:02:48,300 --> 01:02:51,470
looking at commerce systems with their
customers and merchants and

959
01:02:51,470 --> 01:02:52,670
point-of-sale terminals

960
01:02:52,670 --> 01:02:57,200
and banks and clearinghouses and
insurance companies insuring it all

961
01:02:57,200 --> 01:03:00,420
with many different players each with
their own agenda

962
01:03:00,420 --> 01:03:05,310
those are the heart problems and really
those are the systems that are gonna be

963
01:03:05,310 --> 01:03:07,619
used like a photography is not can be
used for them

964
01:03:07,619 --> 01:03:11,000
protect privacy to any large degree the

965
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:16,070
application authentication are much much
bigger and

966
01:03:16,070 --> 01:03:19,020
thanks for listening %uh I think oh we
can turn our something
