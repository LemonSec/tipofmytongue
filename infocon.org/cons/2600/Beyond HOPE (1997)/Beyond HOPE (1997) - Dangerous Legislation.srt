11
00:02:30,850 --> 00:02:31,680
proposed

12
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:34,760
that is potentially dangerous everyone
sitting

13
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:39,950
potential it will introduce ourselves

at Cummings also known as Bernie s I
spent

15
00:02:50,129 --> 00:02:53,200

being the first person in the country

16
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:58,400
charged with violating a new federal
statute I

17
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:02,040
without going into all the details yet
to

18
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:05,720
I was not charged with the accessing any
systems

19
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:09,250
without permission committing any prod

20
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:12,870
anything aspect disperse having in my
possession things that could have been

21
00:03:12,870 --> 00:03:16,670
misused and I'll talk about that
legislation in a couple of other pieces

22
00:03:16,670 --> 00:03:17,750
of legislation

23
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:24,750

maximum-security prisons for

38
00:04:21,639 --> 00:04:25,560
having violent om in late October

39
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:28,680
%uh 1990 4

40
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:33,520
%uh something finally got pushed through
Congress that a lot of people here

41
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:38,870
were someone to wear I had previously
been called the digital telephony bill

42
00:04:38,870 --> 00:04:42,850
which provided for I think initially 500

43
00:04:42,850 --> 00:04:46,169
million dollars at half a billion
dollars other

44
00:04:46,169 --> 00:04:50,080
your money %uh say that the FBI could

45
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:53,599
basically a installer

46
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:57,010
tens of thousands of simultaneous
wiretaps in this country

47
00:04:57,010 --> 00:05:00,260
farm now orders of magnitude more than
they've ever used before

48
00:05:00,260 --> 00:05:04,530
and we'll get to pay for it have it have
the cost tack on your phone bills

49
00:05:04,530 --> 00:05:09,090
but this is this

50
00:05:09,090 --> 00:05:12,710
legislation went through various
versions it died

51
00:05:12,710 --> 00:05:15,810
came back to life again it was killed it
came back again

52
00:05:15,810 --> 00:05:19,350
and it was finally passed in October

53
00:05:19,350 --> 00:05:23,000
for 95 arm with the

54
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,460
surging India smoke-filled rooms by

55
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:30,390
mister free the FBI

56
00:05:30,390 --> 00:05:33,610
and also the head of the national
security

57
00:05:33,610 --> 00:05:36,650
see who visited the last it last two
holdouts

58
00:05:36,650 --> 00:05:39,889
Senate two senators are holding out on

59
00:05:39,889 --> 00:05:43,860
if they thought their sons serious
privacy issues pertaining

60
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:47,810
this bill had got pushed through I'm at
the last minute before was pushed

61
00:05:47,810 --> 00:05:48,669
through an amendment

62
00:05:48,669 --> 00:05:52,139
stack on Chile which amended

63
00:05:52,139 --> 00:05:55,220
title 18 section 10:29

64
00:05:55,220 --> 00:05:58,430
which is a piece of federal legislation

65
00:05:58,430 --> 00:06:02,020
Pascali 15-20 years ago the address

66
00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:05,060
more less credit card fraud and a was

67
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:08,430
it was entitled to fraud and fraud and
related activity

68
00:06:08,430 --> 00:06:11,750
in connection with access devices

69
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:15,110
an access device for those who have done
research is a

70
00:06:15,110 --> 00:06:19,770
I any paraphrase or any card code

71
00:06:19,770 --> 00:06:24,169
played or account number or other means
account access

72
00:06:24,169 --> 00:06:27,849
cell on lot of things a MetroCard

73
00:06:27,849 --> 00:06:31,020
could be considered access device for
instance is for

74
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:36,919
those you just heard the MetroCard panel
couple things that would not be

75
00:06:36,919 --> 00:06:41,700
%ah classified as an access device

76
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:45,190
under some federal case law that I found
would be a a blue box

77
00:06:45,190 --> 00:06:50,240
or red box which are devices that can be
used to manipulate the telephone network

78
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:51,070
into making

79
00:06:51,070 --> 00:06:54,270
thing do things that you're not supposed
to do

80
00:06:54,270 --> 00:06:58,830
the reason that they would be classified
as an access device

81
00:06:58,830 --> 00:07:02,599
because they do not provide means
specific account access

82
00:07:02,599 --> 00:07:07,469
wouldn't be charging Prince the order
usable botch a red box to route calls in

83
00:07:07,469 --> 00:07:08,530
such a manner that the

84
00:07:08,530 --> 00:07:11,930
one around the billing mechanisms phone
company on

85
00:07:11,930 --> 00:07:15,469
it wouldn't bill another person account
just

86
00:07:15,469 --> 00:07:18,530
colleges go through wouldn't be any like

87
00:07:18,530 --> 00:07:22,260
outstanding charge on

88
00:07:22,260 --> 00:07:26,930
specific count so red box a blue boxes
and similar devices are not classified

89
00:07:26,930 --> 00:07:28,310
as access devices

90
00:07:28,310 --> 00:07:31,390
Witcher prevent anyone up until

91
00:07:31,390 --> 00:07:36,099
October 94 from being charged with this
federal law for possession

92
00:07:36,099 --> 00:07:39,599
boxer blue box well this legislation

93
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:44,320
was tacked on you know much these bills
congress have a little Amendment Act the

94
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:46,000
last minute we get a chance to read

95
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,320
and a what this amendment title 29

96
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:54,080

97
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:58,690
10:29 section 85 goes like this:

98

00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:16,099
software that could be used in
conjunction with with any hardware

119
00:09:24,079 --> 00:09:25,660
tonight seven o'clock

120
00:09:25,660 --> 00:09:29,920
on the prisoners panel but to

121
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:33,339
I E A I was guilty this

122
00:09:33,339 --> 00:09:36,430
new statute I am

123
00:09:36,430 --> 00:09:40,709
there's no way around it I possessed %ah
a touchdown dialer

124
00:09:40,709 --> 00:09:44,050
that had been modified with a

125
00:09:44,050 --> 00:09:47,680
6.5 megahertz course Critchell courts
crystal

126
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:51,190
you can buy either these margin any
RadioShack store

127
00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:55,110
dozens of mail order companies everybody

128
00:09:55,110 --> 00:09:58,270
purchase those in the past think they're
illegal but

129
00:09:58,270 --> 00:10:03,589
apparently just possession at the same
now is a federal felony

130
00:10:03,589 --> 00:10:06,650
sorry if you put them together yes

131
00:10:06,650 --> 00:10:10,350
there that we consider that would if you
put them together

132
00:10:10,350 --> 00:10:13,550
would fall under 85 possession

133
00:10:13,550 --> 00:10:16,940
the telecommunications instrument has
been modified were altered

134
00:10:16,940 --> 00:10:20,589
to attain unauthorized use a
telecommunication services

135
00:10:20,589 --> 00:10:23,860
if you did not put them together which
still be it could be considered

136
00:10:23,860 --> 00:10:27,890
a felony it constitutes hardware

137
00:10:27,890 --> 00:10:32,030
used for altering modifying
telecommunications judgments to attain

138
00:10:32,030 --> 00:10:35,640
unauthorized access telecommunication
services I guess you could

139
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:39,420
the team goes far saying a soldering
screwdriver could be used a modified

140
00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:44,140
indications tend to have for the
government to stretch their

141
00:10:44,140 --> 00:10:47,750
stretched argument I guess I'm

142
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:50,910
idea my attorney advised me

143
00:10:50,910 --> 00:10:56,900
that I would be best served to plead
guilty to the statute because

144
00:10:56,900 --> 00:11:01,120
I had no no way to get out the fact that
I didn't eat possess

145
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:05,740
possess this to on I was never charged
for alleged with

146
00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:09,230
having sold the red box to anybody given
want anybody

147
00:11:09,230 --> 00:11:13,600
having every news 12 manipulate the
telephone network in any way

148
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:16,600
but on

149
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:20,459
it was clear fact I had one of these in
my home in

150
00:11:20,459 --> 00:11:24,790
could get around so I'm made what was
called the

151
00:11:24,790 --> 00:11:28,060
as you typically it's a very little used

152
00:11:28,060 --> 00:11:33,020
in federal courts the to says basically
a

153
00:11:33,020 --> 00:11:37,000
at there's no we're if there's

154
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,220
pratensis potential for the const the
statute

155
00:11:40,220 --> 00:11:43,530
were charged %ah it's going to be

156
00:11:43,530 --> 00:11:47,920
appealed on its being potentially
unconstitutional

157
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:51,040
you can make a conditional plea withdraw
that plea in and then challenge

158
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:53,189
constitutionality of that statute

159
00:11:53,189 --> 00:11:56,900
I am to stay where men charged with his
new club for his first person 100

160
00:11:56,900 --> 00:11:57,800
charged

161
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:01,010
I went that route arm

162
00:12:01,010 --> 00:12:04,130
and like guilty the next day with three
my plea

163
00:12:04,130 --> 00:12:07,390
general in federal court when you make a
guilty plea that set in stone

164
00:12:07,390 --> 00:12:10,709
can't you can withdraw but is
conditional

165
00:12:10,709 --> 00:12:14,540
shooting thing let me do that so a

166
00:12:14,540 --> 00:12:19,010
II survival federal sentence and then
then filed an appeal

167
00:12:19,010 --> 00:12:22,980
saying that to basically the terms

168
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:28,030
all the terms of our this in a statue
unconstitutionally vague specifically

169
00:12:28,030 --> 00:12:33,130
the terms telecommunications instrument
unauthorized use

170
00:12:33,130 --> 00:12:34,480
and

171
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:37,610
modified altered world terms that were
not its

172
00:12:37,610 --> 00:12:42,750
really specified in the statute it all
what they meant people to say wiring is

173
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:43,610
a distinct me

174
00:12:43,610 --> 00:12:46,860
and I say that there's a librarian's

175
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:52,300
with their with those terms on french's
modified or altered

176
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:57,139
every time you you use any type computer

177
00:12:57,139 --> 00:13:00,540
telephone that has digital circuitry it
specifically

178
00:13:00,540 --> 00:13:03,699
microprocessor something %ah just

179
00:13:03,699 --> 00:13:07,709
just punching numbers on the keypad
really is modifying altering the

180
00:13:07,709 --> 00:13:08,889
contents of the memory

181
00:13:08,889 --> 00:13:12,870
that found every time you are here on a
computer program you're modifying

182
00:13:12,870 --> 00:13:17,959
altering information hard drive RAM

183
00:13:17,959 --> 00:13:21,540
registers everything is going on the
computers past being modified or altered

184
00:13:21,540 --> 00:13:24,879
if you use a modem to call

185
00:13:24,879 --> 00:13:28,970
another modem on

186
00:13:28,970 --> 00:13:33,019
you are sending AT commands extensively
to them

187
00:13:33,019 --> 00:13:36,709
immature modifying altering s registers
in

188
00:13:36,709 --> 00:13:41,790
om so people can modify alter things
that even being

189
00:13:41,790 --> 00:13:45,349
Bradley where the exceptions

190
00:13:45,350 --> 00:13:49,089
provide this bill for for these things

191
00:13:49,089 --> 00:13:53,850
look to prepay the a one the other terms
I had a problem is with

192
00:13:53,850 --> 00:13:57,359
on the term unauthorized use or
unauthorized access

193
00:13:57,359 --> 00:14:00,429
telecommunication services me

194
00:14:00,429 --> 00:14:03,689
I'm I was a

195
00:14:03,689 --> 00:14:07,019
in addition to possessing a red box I
was charged with possessing

196
00:14:07,019 --> 00:14:11,799
computer software that allows you to
program sailor telephones

197
00:14:11,799 --> 00:14:15,619
electronic serial number alter its phone
number awesome

198
00:14:15,619 --> 00:14:19,559
I gave this of wait hope three years ago
and

199
00:14:19,559 --> 00:14:24,199
was put on hold net to people that copy
7 and also wessel

200
00:14:24,199 --> 00:14:28,290
book explaining how to make the cables
to modify your fam but to

201
00:14:28,290 --> 00:14:32,309
what a lot of people misunderstood about
the software did not allow you

202
00:14:32,309 --> 00:14:35,368
to did not enable you to go out

203
00:14:35,369 --> 00:14:38,869
charge phone calls to other sailors us
chicken

204
00:14:38,869 --> 00:14:42,379
give you the ability to obtain other
people's electronic serial numbers

205
00:14:42,379 --> 00:14:46,360
it simply allows you to change this your
number

206
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:50,519
gonna bring your fam 21 that you already
had say

207
00:14:50,519 --> 00:14:54,100
another yes and you had theater phone in
your car

208
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:58,309
army wanted have a portable phone also
you want to have to be two separate

209
00:14:58,309 --> 00:14:59,610
bills in two separate numbers

210
00:14:59,610 --> 00:15:04,419
arm I came up with this says package I
didn't write the algorithms I got

211
00:15:04,419 --> 00:15:08,789
some awesome with the other some other
utilities on a gas can

212
00:15:08,789 --> 00:15:12,419
but together people gave it away at Hope
so that to

213
00:15:12,419 --> 00:15:16,239
it look basically role as many exchanges
any they wanted on offense

214
00:15:16,239 --> 00:15:20,269
just like it you have five fashion house
you know if I say I found on your phone

215
00:15:20,269 --> 00:15:20,639
number

216
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:24,799
suffered in what used you anybody else's
electronic she remembers what you need

217
00:15:24,799 --> 00:15:26,019
specialized equipment to do

218
00:15:26,019 --> 00:15:30,100
when I was never charged with having
anyway the government's argue

219
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:35,509
argument was that since the cellular
carriers do not authorized you

220
00:15:35,509 --> 00:15:40,350
specifically to do this that constituted
an unauthorized

221
00:15:40,350 --> 00:15:43,759
access to their telecommunications
service and there's

222
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:46,850
that second found would not be
authorized to access the system

223
00:15:46,850 --> 00:15:51,179
and there was a government target my
case on it didn't say

224
00:15:51,179 --> 00:15:54,249
anywhere in the legislation who who had
the

225
00:15:54,249 --> 00:15:59,819
the permission or the power to say what
is authorize are not authorized

226
00:15:59,819 --> 00:16:04,809
ostensibly but assumed that meant the
telecommunications carrier but it could

227
00:16:04,809 --> 00:16:05,539
really be any

228
00:16:05,539 --> 00:16:10,299
I mean if if the anyone to settle an
unauthorized

229
00:16:10,299 --> 00:16:13,949
so unauthorized that was that was kinda
left be to on

230
00:16:13,949 --> 00:16:19,019
so I filed my federal appeal and a
Staffordshire my time here we had

231
00:16:19,019 --> 00:16:21,470
nothing to gain as far as getting time
back in my life

232
00:16:21,470 --> 00:16:25,850
on couldn't turn back clock in at that
time

233
00:16:25,850 --> 00:16:29,610
was taken away from me this prison but I
felt it important

234
00:16:29,610 --> 00:16:34,259
to to challenge the statute because I
didn't want a president said

235
00:16:34,259 --> 00:16:38,009
whereby really anybody possessed
hardware/software

236
00:16:38,009 --> 00:16:42,489
that could potentially be used for
unauthorized access telecommunication

237
00:16:42,489 --> 00:16:43,009
services

238
00:16:43,009 --> 00:16:46,319
i won I want to bring us a good person
for that now

239
00:16:46,319 --> 00:16:49,449
I'll talk about my kids tonight as far
as wild charged with this

240
00:16:49,449 --> 00:16:52,589
I don't believe that everybody sitting
here is gonna be charged with

241
00:16:52,589 --> 00:16:55,939
om charged with violating this law

242
00:16:55,939 --> 00:16:59,699
because its it has been probably will be
used for selectively

243
00:16:59,699 --> 00:17:04,010
my case a secret service I Heather reach
using it selectively

244
00:17:04,010 --> 00:17:09,000
my case but on bottom line is we have a
federal statute on the books now

245
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:12,159
that was passed without any a

246
00:17:12,159 --> 00:17:15,250
hearings or a committee deliberations

247
00:17:15,250 --> 00:17:19,809
that makes it a federal felony
punishable by up to five years

248
00:17:19,809 --> 00:17:23,689
in federal prison to under fifty
thousand dollar fine for possessing

249
00:17:23,689 --> 00:17:27,510
hardware/software that could be used

250
00:17:27,510 --> 00:17:31,190
in a manner to access telecommunication
services

251
00:17:31,190 --> 00:17:34,909
away those companies or whoever said

252
00:17:34,909 --> 00:17:39,520
in his unauthorized I'm I don't think is
good

253
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:44,529
unfortunately the federal court 3rd
district decided that a

254
00:17:44,529 --> 00:17:48,340
these terms were not unconstitutionally
vague on

255
00:17:48,340 --> 00:17:54,209
the the prosecutor Mike a startup and
all the FCC ruling that to define what a

256
00:17:54,210 --> 00:17:59,159
a year telecommunications device wisner
instrument the device

257
00:17:59,159 --> 00:18:03,090
and that that definition said that any
any yet

258
00:18:03,090 --> 00:18:07,520
apparatus image any sound or signal

259
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:11,639
is considered a telecommunications
device and a

260
00:18:11,639 --> 00:18:15,639
I get a lot of things and it sounds are
signals that

261
00:18:15,639 --> 00:18:18,760
there could be considered
telecommunications device left a pretty

262
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:20,470
broad definition

263
00:18:20,470 --> 00:18:23,659
I think a a country that

264
00:18:23,659 --> 00:18:27,200
people or people really value their
liberties we should have a lot of big

265
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:28,940
laws on the books that

266
00:18:28,940 --> 00:18:32,960
that allow a believe the prosecutors in

267
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:37,010
law enforcement agencies to define

268
00:18:37,010 --> 00:18:41,340
it as they go along as it did in my case
is kinda like making up the rules in the

269
00:18:41,340 --> 00:18:41,668
middle

270
00:18:41,669 --> 00:18:45,619
the game cell may sound like a sour
grapes and

271
00:18:45,619 --> 00:18:48,428
I spent a lot of money after my
conviction after a certain my time

272
00:18:48,429 --> 00:18:49,520
trying to

273
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:53,600
trying to fight this thing unfortunately
sir

274
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:57,309
the court's previous judgment was
affirmed and now we have a federal case

275
00:18:57,309 --> 00:18:59,678
law that says that

276
00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:03,270
this terminology is not not be

277
00:19:03,270 --> 00:19:07,230
I don't agree with that how much was
your country but on

278
00:19:07,230 --> 00:19:11,369
I I do firmly believe we should have
legislation that makes it

279
00:19:11,369 --> 00:19:14,720
make the crime to steal
telecommunication services

280
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:18,320
or to trespass and other people systems
I think there should be some penalties

281
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:19,600
provided for that

282
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:22,659
om any circumstances

283
00:19:22,659 --> 00:19:26,649
but in situations where the defendant
not even alleged

284
00:19:26,649 --> 00:19:30,539
to have access any system without
anyone's permission

285
00:19:30,539 --> 00:19:33,779
or have used any hardware or software

286
00:19:33,779 --> 00:19:37,700
to obtain unauthorized access
telecommunication services having

287
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:38,590
something

288
00:19:38,590 --> 00:19:43,899
that could be used way I E computer
software

289
00:19:43,899 --> 00:19:48,110
touchdown dialer blue box or any other
contraption

290
00:19:48,110 --> 00:19:52,500
and somebody would have to happen to
make on just having that

291
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:56,289
with the knowledge that it could be
misused as for the intent comes in

292
00:19:56,289 --> 00:20:00,539
on sorry

293
00:20:00,539 --> 00:20:03,990
church family here to set a tape with
the town's on

294
00:20:03,990 --> 00:20:08,289
simply as backers a there's a piece of
music in a couple years ago

295
00:20:08,289 --> 00:20:11,809
some some label where the song had

296
00:20:11,809 --> 00:20:16,039
red boxed hands-on so yes that CD could
be considered

297
00:20:16,039 --> 00:20:20,090
violent possession sede piddling your
hot water can I think people in the

298
00:20:20,090 --> 00:20:21,889
charger that all over the country

299
00:20:21,889 --> 00:20:24,980
but we have we have what I think its
dangers legislation

300
00:20:24,980 --> 00:20:29,389
it's on the books now not much we can do
about it you can really challenge this

301
00:20:29,389 --> 00:20:33,080
unless you're in a position to show that
you can harm by it

302
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:36,330
that's why I was really only person had
the ability to

303
00:20:36,330 --> 00:20:39,860
challenge legislation was first person
charged with it and I could should

304
00:20:39,860 --> 00:20:43,389
I'm buy it because I search seven months
in federal prison

305
00:20:43,389 --> 00:20:47,039
for it on but to

306
00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:50,580
I could take it one step up to the
Supreme Court that point I was

307
00:20:50,580 --> 00:20:54,658
exhausted financially physically and
emotionally

308
00:20:54,659 --> 00:20:58,429
want to get the whole thing behind me so
Iran esteem

309
00:20:58,429 --> 00:21:01,909
seven emails just right for that down
they're gonna have to fight the

310
00:21:01,909 --> 00:21:03,230
president that

311
00:21:03,230 --> 00:21:06,679
I unfortunately set by having might my

312
00:21:06,679 --> 00:21:10,470
appeal turned down and

313
00:21:10,470 --> 00:21:14,320
they might win but they're gonna have a
lot of money in

314
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:18,908
lawyers arm there's a lot of stuff on my

us but on at the stuff is getting past
and now

362
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:22,020
laughing in legislative process somehow
keep up on what's going on because

363
00:24:22,020 --> 00:24:25,309
conceivably anyone here would

364
00:24:25,309 --> 00:24:29,908
would be a target federal or state
agency maybe for other reasons

365
00:24:29,909 --> 00:24:33,149
could have this have a slot thrown at
them and they get into

366
00:24:33,149 --> 00:24:37,500
have in your life seriously

367
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:40,750
detoured for your tour longer

368
00:24:40,750 --> 00:24:44,070
I going to mount other piece of
legislation to pass that on taking the

369
00:24:44,070 --> 00:24:44,530
time

370
00:24:44,530 --> 00:24:48,879
energy gallon been actively involved in
in

371
00:24:48,879 --> 00:24:52,020
trying to shape this legislation

372
00:24:52,020 --> 00:24:55,379
so there is less onerous before it
actually gets pushed through

373
00:24:55,379 --> 00:25:00,500
so let me a St Barbara dresser some that
other issues

374

after a magistrate in

377
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:06,320
you know my friend is in Princeton

378
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:15,620
alright this is me I downloaded the

379
00:26:15,620 --> 00:26:16,260
cool I think

380
00:26:16,260 --> 00:26:22,190

iraq's dealers telecommunications watch

384
00:26:30,679 --> 00:26:35,780

group that we started

385
00:26:35,780 --> 00:26:40,399
probably about three and a half years
ago

386
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:47,200
here in New York got once one-page
wanted to do was to lobby I internet

387
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:47,820
issues

388
00:26:47,820 --> 00:26:51,600
we were we're afraid that there is not
enough work being done to do so

389
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:52,679
grassroots

390
00:26:52,679 --> 00:26:56,260
direct lobbying people calling congress
arm

391
00:26:56,260 --> 00:27:00,200
before so we started working on a couple
issues we did

392
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:04,490
encryption for Maria Cantwell when she
had her bill running around we were

393
00:27:04,490 --> 00:27:08,160
people to call on that we did digital
telephony which is something that very

394
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:09,070
talked about

395
00:27:09,070 --> 00:27:12,790
we did the CTA that a nice piece of
trash which got

396
00:27:12,790 --> 00:27:16,830
jerked around Supreme Court thanks to
folks like the Sikh coalition run by the

397
00:27:16,830 --> 00:27:18,350
Center for Democracy and technology

398
00:27:18,350 --> 00:27:21,370
and we also are doing up to now

399
00:27:21,370 --> 00:27:24,809
I was in a sec so we thought the CTA

400
00:27:24,809 --> 00:27:28,460
we there's a new york state censorship
bill on you know about that

401
00:27:28,460 --> 00:27:33,770
the ACLU follow challenge we raise money
for it plaintiff's expert witnesses

402
00:27:33,770 --> 00:27:39,129
and kicked ass we also helped create
democracy net

403
00:27:39,130 --> 00:27:42,419
and that's an online site we can go and
you can

404
00:27:42,419 --> 00:27:46,120
check out congressional hearings effect
is a reason

405
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:50,770
briefing on human rights folks in other
countries to use encryption

406
00:27:50,770 --> 00:27:54,129
to protect themselves from oppressive
regimes now

407
00:27:54,130 --> 00:27:57,190
bernie's paid his dues to

408
00:27:57,190 --> 00:28:01,480
in space but in other countries where if
people can get to what's on your hard

409
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:01,960
drive

410
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:04,710
and what you're collecting is very
sensitive information human rights

411
00:28:04,710 --> 00:28:05,570
abuses

412
00:28:05,570 --> 00:28:09,178
in jail just kill and such a good
democracy

413
00:28:09,179 --> 00:28:13,070
here about an hour and a half briefing
on people use for typography in places

414
00:28:13,070 --> 00:28:13,389
like

415
00:28:13,390 --> 00:28:17,980
cambodian so forth and use it to protect
themselves from the

416
00:28:17,980 --> 00:28:21,890
the military regimes on most recently

417
00:28:21,890 --> 00:28:27,600
is two things you've been doing been
organizing people individual states like

418
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:30,960
New York and New Jersey to go and meet
with a member congress to talk about the

419
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:32,480
importance of encryption important

420
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:36,510
privacy why it is that you should have a
right to a private conversation

421
00:28:36,510 --> 00:28:40,620
that should be very very private stick
securing strong encryption

422
00:28:40,620 --> 00:28:45,110
we've also been working with the Federal
Trade Commission folks that send you

423
00:28:45,110 --> 00:28:46,080
pyramid schemes

Usenet groups and said in the email

425
00:28:50,620 --> 00:28:54,909

it's something that's already illegal

426
00:28:54,909 --> 00:28:58,070
we're helping them to find it and then
they're gonna go after and prosecute

427
00:28:58,070 --> 00:29:05,070

yesterday about encryption

450
00:31:11,060 --> 00:31:15,159
on you are allowed to hide documents in
your house there's no law that says you

451
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:15,960
can't do that

452
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:20,240
you're allowed to bury them in it
55-gallon drum in the middle of the

453
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:21,830
woods if you're really concerned about

454
00:31:21,830 --> 00:31:26,620
you're allowed to speak with your
friends in any language if you speak

455
00:31:26,620 --> 00:31:30,150
Navajo for example there's nothing says
you have to speak a language that

456
00:31:30,150 --> 00:31:33,840
law enforcement understand you're
allowed to have secret meetings in your

457
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:36,100
home you want to have in your closet
where no one can find

458
00:31:36,100 --> 00:31:40,130

462
00:31:49,620 --> 00:31:54,280
checking on paper pay for most things in
cash and finally allowed to hide stuff

463
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:59,020
under for secure larger so extra pockets
in your code now what is the one thing

464
00:31:59,020 --> 00:32:03,300
we should all be thinking but I'm did
not mention you can do take measures to

465
00:32:03,300 --> 00:32:04,300

466
00:32:04,300 --> 00:32:08,570
encryption absolutely right encryption

467
00:32:08,570 --> 00:32:12,679
encryption technology is locked in the
keys in the information age

468
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:16,500
and that's why all these people are
seeing have stickers and buttons and say

469
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:17,900
my lot Mikey

470
00:32:17,900 --> 00:32:22,190
right you have the right to use
encryption to protect your privacy

471
00:32:22,190 --> 00:32:26,750
I have the right to communicate and if I
want to without having anyone else here

472
00:32:26,750 --> 00:32:28,790
have the right to listen now

473
00:32:28,790 --> 00:32:32,920
law enforcement the right to try not
guarantee I have the right to fight

474
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:36,630
to use strong protection and they have
the right to try and white at me

475
00:32:36,630 --> 00:32:40,050
well since we are talking about heinous

476
00:32:40,050 --> 00:32:43,370
dangerous legislation here is some

477
00:32:43,370 --> 00:32:49,130
there's a bill going through congress
right now in the house called safe and

478
00:32:49,130 --> 00:32:49,620
the safe

479
00:32:49,620 --> 00:32:53,680
bill the security and freedom for
encryption act would do a lot of things

480
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:54,570
including

481
00:32:54,570 --> 00:32:58,610
set up the market a little different my
mother and my grandmother could use

482
00:32:58,610 --> 00:32:59,160
encryption

483
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:05,800
I think pgp my mom can use 102 said
right so it's going to be built into

484
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:07,320
stock it's gonna be a mass-market

485
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:10,678
element it's not today ever in this room
fieger

486
00:33:10,679 --> 00:33:15,420
pgp by we're a small fraction the
population to really

487
00:33:15,420 --> 00:33:18,870
yet corruption out there's gotta be mass
market products

488
00:33:18,870 --> 00:33:22,490
well what this this bill was general
that opposition

489
00:33:22,490 --> 00:33:25,870
as you can imagine makes people very
nervous

490
00:33:25,870 --> 00:33:28,860
special law enforcement to have a lot of
us running around the strong encryption

491
00:33:28,860 --> 00:33:30,520
that is not easily breakable

492
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:34,240
and so they propose this amendment which
never got brought out

493
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:38,350
they wrote the amendment waved it around
but it never was actually attached to

494
00:33:38,350 --> 00:33:39,270
any legislation

495
00:33:39,270 --> 00:33:43,679
and still waiting I assume for an
opportune time

496
00:33:43,679 --> 00:33:46,970
what it says is that it's unlawful

497
00:33:46,970 --> 00:33:50,700
for anyone to manufacture distribute
seller import any products

498
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:55,290
the dozen Christian that does not have a
real time detection capability

499
00:33:55,290 --> 00:33:58,590
right basically no strong encryption

500
00:33:58,590 --> 00:34:02,080
anything that you would really use
because a protecting your privacy

501
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:05,270
you can't if the lawn for some folks
can't decode it

502
00:34:05,270 --> 00:34:09,290
and less real time will say this 24
hours or less now

503
00:34:09,290 --> 00:34:14,120
24 hours or less law enforcement do it
the bad guys can do it at the bad guys

504
00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:15,810
can do it is not doing what I need

505
00:34:15,810 --> 00:34:19,629
it's not stronger securing corruption
across the family for this

506
00:34:19,629 --> 00:34:23,500
hundred thousand dollars there's no
reason to believe

507
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:27,668
that things like pgp and netscape strong

508
00:34:27,668 --> 00:34:32,009
browser don't fall under this and this
would be the end of strong encryption

509
00:34:32,010 --> 00:34:33,090
privacy

510
00:34:33,090 --> 00:34:37,139
we can all his

511
00:34:37,139 --> 00:34:40,529
now

512
00:34:40,529 --> 00:34:42,279
alright there is hope

513
00:34:42,279 --> 00:34:45,339
in more ways than one on

514
00:34:45,339 --> 00:34:48,480
one of the things we're doing is were

515
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:52,510
trying to get people to go and talk to
the members of Congress and educate

516
00:34:52,510 --> 00:34:53,730
there's an incredible

517
00:34:53,730 --> 00:34:56,859
lack of understanding about encryption

518
00:34:56,859 --> 00:35:00,029
privacy in the Internet in general and
how computers work

519
00:35:00,029 --> 00:35:04,500
on the part of Congress and so you can
explain these things

520
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:08,750
thank you can explain a lot better than
anybody else to do it there's a couple

521
00:35:08,750 --> 00:35:10,710
ways you can participate in once again
this is

522
00:35:10,710 --> 00:35:15,099
my like Mikey on if you go website
accepted on

523
00:35:15,099 --> 00:35:18,980
you can do is call adopting your
legislator don't have to know you

524
00:35:18,980 --> 00:35:24,309
legislator is this doesn't mean the UN
Karen what it means the type in your zip

525
00:35:24,309 --> 00:35:26,900
code a type in your email address

526
00:35:26,900 --> 00:35:30,170
and we absolutely do except like
anonymized

527
00:35:30,170 --> 00:35:33,230
email addresses and you can type it in

528
00:35:33,230 --> 00:35:36,640
and then we'll send you an email when
your member congress about

529
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:39,730
right before they're going to have a big

530
00:35:39,730 --> 00:35:44,299
village now or visit town hall meeting
election seeking going you can call them

531
00:35:44,299 --> 00:35:45,038
you can talk to them

532
00:35:45,039 --> 00:35:48,039
um we also is also registered

533
00:35:48,039 --> 00:35:51,720
you have no intention of voting it
always helps

534
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:55,470
never the congress to have listings
addresses and

535
00:35:55,470 --> 00:35:59,359
if you're either in New Yorker
Massachusetts have voter registration

536
00:35:59,359 --> 00:35:59,930
forms

537
00:35:59,930 --> 00:36:06,368
previous stand set to spend any money
after a felony

538
00:36:06,369 --> 00:36:12,400
I calling my congressman is appropriate
and most importantly

539
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:16,319
it just happens that during August a
lotta members of congress are home and

540
00:36:16,319 --> 00:36:16,829
so

541
00:36:16,829 --> 00:36:19,839
this town hall meetings with herbal male
you about but

542
00:36:19,839 --> 00:36:23,670
you can also go and have an appointment
you know you live here

543
00:36:23,670 --> 00:36:27,779
your computing professional right they
don't know what you do for a living

544
00:36:27,779 --> 00:36:30,769
you can't do anything good for letting
me do something good for a living but if

545
00:36:30,769 --> 00:36:32,220
you're very technical person

546
00:36:32,220 --> 00:36:35,809
you have an opportunity to educate you
an opportunity to lobby

547
00:36:35,809 --> 00:36:38,890
explain to them that strong encryption
is really necessary

548
00:36:38,890 --> 00:36:43,170
and that if encryption that you and i
can use is so weak they can be broken

549
00:36:43,170 --> 00:36:47,650
today by law enforcement thank you
probably also be broken today by

550
00:36:47,650 --> 00:36:51,220
rogue nations organized crime and

551
00:36:51,220 --> 00:36:54,019
people who don't have your best
interests at heart and criminals looking

552
00:36:54,019 --> 00:36:54,809
to defraud

553
00:36:54,809 --> 00:37:01,809
that is equally bad

554
00:37:04,120 --> 00:37:07,960
to hear some information if you're
interested in

555
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:11,210
encryption more pressure on corruption
in the legislation check out this

556
00:37:11,210 --> 00:37:12,710
website for to dot com

557
00:37:12,710 --> 00:37:15,940
junk e-mail I mention go to check email
Lord

558
00:37:15,940 --> 00:37:19,470
word bTW Lord the democracy

559
00:37:19,470 --> 00:37:22,580
that site is there if you want to read
this

560
00:37:22,580 --> 00:37:26,180
decision for the communications decency
act that the citizens in

561
00:37:26,180 --> 00:37:29,819
power karma coalition was a party to

562
00:37:29,820 --> 00:37:33,410
and redone nine Supreme Court justices
kick the government's ass

563
00:37:33,410 --> 00:37:37,730
you might wanna go there the New York
State law that was overturned

564
00:37:37,730 --> 00:37:41,880
you read the transcripts from the trial
you can go to our non-profit site there

565
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:45,590
and finally the one that got cut off we
run

566
00:37:45,590 --> 00:37:49,100
week on the big board so place retrying
key players to all the current

567
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:50,720
legislation that affects the Internet

568
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:54,160
on and this is a pointer to it and from
there you can

569
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:57,299
sky jumping off points to leverage
congress Thomas

570
00:37:57,300 --> 00:38:01,940
see can actually read the legislation as
well as our opinion a bit and I think

571
00:38:01,940 --> 00:38:02,410
that's it

572
00:38:02,410 --> 00:38:05,529
I'll leave it overnight is Steve barber
now he does

573
00:38:05,530 --> 00:38:09,830
is a lawyer the only lawyer on this
panel ill talk about some of the more

574
00:38:09,830 --> 00:38:12,020
interesting piece of legislation in
Congress right now

575
00:38:12,020 --> 00:38:18,620
one more thing

576
00:38:18,620 --> 00:38:22,910
most intelligent question is a teacher
this is the

577
00:38:22,910 --> 00:38:29,910
you with a flag teacher

578
00:38:41,500 --> 00:38:47,749
hello

579
00:38:47,749 --> 00:38:51,440
thanks a lot um I just want to talk
about a few

580
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:55,009
this works with another

581
00:38:55,009 --> 00:38:58,309
I like this is like

582
00:38:58,309 --> 00:39:02,200
something to play but the

583
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:05,960
five years ago we started kinda looking
out what it would mean

584
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:09,019
civil rights in cyberspace basically

585
00:39:09,019 --> 00:39:12,210
my colleagues and I heard interested in
this

586
00:39:12,210 --> 00:39:15,109
started talking up the idea and found
out that no wonder what the hell we were

587
00:39:15,109 --> 00:39:15,839
talking about

588
00:39:15,839 --> 00:39:20,480
we spent a lot of our time kind of
explaining to legislators

589
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:26,569
law enforcement officials what now

590
00:39:26,569 --> 00:39:30,950
things have changed quite a bit now the
kind of things that

591
00:39:30,950 --> 00:39:34,880
used to be introduced used to have
affects on computers inadvertently

592
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:38,589
effects on networks that was through
them up were thinking about them

593
00:39:38,589 --> 00:39:42,150
the difference between then and now is
now they're really thinking about

594
00:39:42,150 --> 00:39:45,589
another intentionally trying to screw so

595
00:39:45,589 --> 00:39:49,859
vigilance is gonna be even more
important fortunately since the Internet

596
00:39:49,859 --> 00:39:52,400
is now kinda mainstream you know what my
grandmother's on

597
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:56,289
now there's plenty of organizations
second look at this

598
00:39:56,289 --> 00:39:59,819
ACLU jumped in a couple years ago
bang-up job

599
00:39:59,819 --> 00:40:04,210
but I think it's up to groups like bTW
you tryna be on the front edge trying to

600
00:40:04,210 --> 00:40:05,890
look at what no one's really looking at

601
00:40:05,890 --> 00:40:09,230
pull it out and get everybody out
popular congressman's

602
00:40:09,230 --> 00:40:12,630
really do here's a couple other areas
that

603
00:40:12,630 --> 00:40:17,900
you wanna get up to date on for example
there's encryption which beer talked a

604
00:40:17,900 --> 00:40:18,539
bit about

605
00:40:18,539 --> 00:40:22,589
he talked about one builders like 45
other bills already introduced in

606
00:40:22,589 --> 00:40:24,078
congress with various degrees

607
00:40:24,079 --> 00:40:28,480
reasonable listeners to preserve
harmonious she was talking about the

608
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:28,940
safe

609
00:40:28,940 --> 00:40:32,519
what's I guess most people think is the
most reasonable but

610
00:40:32,519 --> 00:40:35,890
even talk too much about the process

611
00:40:35,890 --> 00:40:38,940
what happens after these things get
introduced and passed something

612
00:40:38,940 --> 00:40:40,009
reasonable happens

613
00:40:40,009 --> 00:40:43,380
there's all these committee meetings and
conference things reason introduce

614
00:40:43,380 --> 00:40:46,380
things the last minute without hearings
and that's where

615
00:40:46,380 --> 00:40:49,670
groups like bTW come in and try to jump
in CDT

616
00:40:49,670 --> 00:40:52,930
ACLU to jump in say hey this should be
happening

617
00:40:52,930 --> 00:40:57,009
gonna make this open news encryption
things happening

618
00:40:57,009 --> 00:41:00,359
there's still some first amendment
legislation being introduced probably

619
00:41:00,359 --> 00:41:01,019
know that the

620
00:41:01,019 --> 00:41:03,989
communications decency act got
overturned by the Supreme Court a couple

621
00:41:03,989 --> 00:41:04,940
months ago well

622
00:41:04,940 --> 00:41:09,489
all the people want to see that happen
gonna introduce a bill to the congress

623
00:41:09,489 --> 00:41:13,950
to see with the boundaries about or
maybe get some decency restrictions back

624
00:41:13,950 --> 00:41:17,420
in the congress again some other you
know maybe do want to keep

625
00:41:17,420 --> 00:41:23,970
maybe people think that's a good thing
but you look at the boundaries junk

626
00:41:23,970 --> 00:41:26,589
email address listeners three or four
bills happening

627
00:41:26,589 --> 00:41:31,230
it's even hard to tell apart again look
at the junk e-mail

628
00:41:31,230 --> 00:41:34,430
website fantastic table outlines

629
00:41:34,430 --> 00:41:37,680
what's going on what's the differences
between them are

630
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:42,288
bills on election information how
election

631
00:41:42,289 --> 00:41:46,299
information made public were not made
public by the winners all kinds of

632
00:41:46,299 --> 00:41:49,499
fights around that Muslim do with
funding

633
00:41:49,499 --> 00:41:53,650
who gets in a while what's intriguing
political stuff and only politicians

634
00:41:53,650 --> 00:41:54,460
really care about

635
00:41:54,460 --> 00:41:59,589
faxes all salsa taxation earn any money
for bill clinton say

636
00:41:59,589 --> 00:42:02,880
come out and say we'll

637
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:06,019
internet commerce or to be fairly free
is a couple bills

638
00:42:06,019 --> 00:42:10,039
to make it not that you can ever tax
things happen on the Internet make it so

639
00:42:10,039 --> 00:42:10,680
that

640
00:42:10,680 --> 00:42:14,200
caps on an extra special taxes

641
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:17,980
and finally there's some piece of
legislation on internet gambling

642
00:42:17,980 --> 00:42:22,869
organs detail while you might wonder why
internet gambling is interesting hackers

643
00:42:22,869 --> 00:42:27,059
kinda interesting an interesting to
everybody what they're trying to

644
00:42:27,059 --> 00:42:27,999
criminalize their

645
00:42:27,999 --> 00:42:34,499
WWW dot

646
00:42:34,499 --> 00:42:41,499
junk e-mail door I I wanna say a couple
things about privacy because

647
00:42:44,130 --> 00:42:48,450
severe touched on right to privacy in
trips and things like that one of the

648
00:42:48,450 --> 00:42:49,059
things that's

649
00:42:49,059 --> 00:42:52,890
those people that aren't lawyers don't
think about too much

650
00:42:52,890 --> 00:42:56,259
the right to privacy

651
00:42:56,259 --> 00:43:01,019
United States is Connor's its cover if
you think if you look at the US

652
00:43:01,019 --> 00:43:04,059
constitution won't see the word privacy
mention there anywhere

653
00:43:04,059 --> 00:43:08,180
it took about I don't know 150 years the
supreme court to come out and say there

654
00:43:08,180 --> 00:43:09,379
is a right to privacy

655
00:43:09,380 --> 00:43:12,619
and the kinda said well there is one

656
00:43:12,619 --> 00:43:15,809
they don't mention it we kinda found
bits and pieces under the Fourteenth

657
00:43:15,809 --> 00:43:16,309
Amendment

658
00:43:16,309 --> 00:43:20,369
an item in all those things that say
unita's award

659
00:43:20,369 --> 00:43:23,519
camcorder troops your house what seems
to have something to do privacy

660
00:43:23,519 --> 00:43:27,230
the supreme court said yes there is a
right to privacy but nobody really knows

661
00:43:27,230 --> 00:43:33,319
the contours are there's two kinds of
privacy come out one

662
00:43:33,319 --> 00:43:36,319
talk about privacy in a legal sense
there's privacy

663
00:43:36,319 --> 00:43:39,480
has to do with maintain your
independence to make really important

664
00:43:39,480 --> 00:43:41,539
personal decisions like the right to
abortion

665
00:43:41,539 --> 00:43:45,059
contraception there's also

666
00:43:45,059 --> 00:43:48,410
what gets talked about we've been
talking about which is the right to

667
00:43:48,410 --> 00:43:51,399
avoid disclosure personal matters that's
workers

668
00:43:51,400 --> 00:43:57,410
most interest the most usually

669
00:43:57,410 --> 00:44:00,519
a lotta times is a simple filed as not
just

670
00:44:00,519 --> 00:44:03,829
privacy for the call data privacy

671
00:44:03,829 --> 00:44:07,319
was an aspect of it acid disclosing your
personal information

672
00:44:07,319 --> 00:44:11,390
with cookies on using netscape things
like that

673
00:44:11,390 --> 00:44:14,609
that's a particular area where the
United States is fantastically week in

674
00:44:14,609 --> 00:44:15,680
protecting

675
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:19,419
individual's privacy information to go
over Europe

676
00:44:19,420 --> 00:44:23,460
there's whole lot of laws that protect
vigils privacy where

677
00:44:23,460 --> 00:44:27,000
doing business with someone you have to
explicitly opt have

678
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:30,450
information released certain things that
have to be complied with

679
00:44:30,450 --> 00:44:33,489
due to cross the borders mother that
exists

680
00:44:33,489 --> 00:44:36,799
a little bit of a Texas stitches like a
lawless twenty-years-old

681
00:44:36,799 --> 00:44:43,799
intensely and was a couple bills in
Congress now that will strengthen

682
00:44:44,049 --> 00:44:47,460
can be both good and bad like everything
cuts both ways you want people to know

683
00:44:47,460 --> 00:44:48,250
your interest

684
00:44:48,250 --> 00:44:53,119
sir but general

685
00:44:53,119 --> 00:44:56,180
people comes buy and sell your personal
information is not a lot you can do

686
00:44:56,180 --> 00:45:00,640
about it

687
00:45:00,640 --> 00:45:04,819
it's also important to notice that

688
00:45:04,819 --> 00:45:08,069
when you're talking about privacy
releasing information to distinguish

689
00:45:08,069 --> 00:45:09,359
between government action

690
00:45:09,359 --> 00:45:13,299
private action love you to get a pretty
strong bill having the government

691
00:45:13,299 --> 00:45:16,739
protect the rights to your personal data

692
00:45:16,739 --> 00:45:20,380
problem is most discloses goes out there
isn't done by the government's done by

693
00:45:20,380 --> 00:45:22,430
private corporations like TRW

694
00:45:22,430 --> 00:45:27,118
credit check corporations was kind of a
limit as to how much the government can

695
00:45:27,119 --> 00:45:28,119
actually protect

696
00:45:28,119 --> 00:45:32,900
going on okay

697
00:45:32,900 --> 00:45:36,150
couple only that into this quick
discussion the safe

698
00:45:36,150 --> 00:45:39,489
I think severe talked about a pretty
well he talked about having a right to

699
00:45:39,489 --> 00:45:40,039
encryption

700
00:45:40,039 --> 00:45:43,430
well yeah maybe you have a right to
encryption

701
00:45:43,430 --> 00:45:46,750
that's not that's all we established I
think you do

702
00:45:46,750 --> 00:45:50,200
but what is the limits I'm safe time
goes out

703
00:45:50,200 --> 00:45:53,569
says the congress okay we don't hear the
constitution's

704
00:45:53,569 --> 00:45:56,829
with the congress will say fine certain
limited right

705
00:45:56,829 --> 00:46:00,650
to to corruption sense or not gonna have
mandatory key escrow

706
00:46:00,650 --> 00:46:04,390
that's terrific that's a huge step the
reasons why I think

707
00:46:04,390 --> 00:46:08,509
people support but there's something
that's safe doesn't do

708
00:46:08,509 --> 00:46:13,200
safe doesn't say that there's absolutely
no right to ever say give over your crib

709
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:15,239
Shinji

710
00:46:15,239 --> 00:46:20,190
suspected crimes or nurse if that if the
law enforcement officers can do that

711
00:46:20,190 --> 00:46:20,789
today

712
00:46:20,789 --> 00:46:26,680
some art can they'll be able to have the
same rights after savers before said

713
00:46:26,680 --> 00:46:32,089
still things to talk about

714
00:46:32,089 --> 00:46:35,940
was so jumping around to a few different
topics talk about internet gambling for

715
00:46:35,940 --> 00:46:37,099
second it's kinda

716
00:46:37,099 --> 00:46:41,859
random topic but before the before the
panel were sitting down towards the

717
00:46:41,859 --> 00:46:42,660
unifying theme

718
00:46:42,660 --> 00:46:46,558
this topic this panel unifying view this
panel is

719
00:46:46,559 --> 00:46:49,559
bad legislation

720
00:46:49,559 --> 00:46:53,190
all the related to the internet if you
look at any bill you'll find

721
00:46:53,190 --> 00:46:56,930
pieces things all that that we're all
that well thought-out

722
00:46:56,930 --> 00:47:01,379
process legislation is kinda random or
love interests are in their original

723
00:47:01,380 --> 00:47:05,489
in there Internet Gambling Act which is
the Senate bill

724
00:47:05,489 --> 00:47:10,559
474 in general has a bunch of language

725
00:47:10,559 --> 00:47:13,619
that basically makes it more clear that
it's

726
00:47:13,619 --> 00:47:18,869
the legal do gambling kind of things
online as it was to do offline

727
00:47:18,869 --> 00:47:25,849
Cove really hard to argue with that from
principled way except it's annoying

728
00:47:25,849 --> 00:47:29,829
so most of it is just kind of going down
that path extending communications

729
00:47:29,829 --> 00:47:34,089
nations things like that

730
00:47:34,089 --> 00:47:36,940
but there's a couple things other were
talking about in terms of Internet

731
00:47:36,940 --> 00:47:37,930
freedom

732
00:47:37,930 --> 00:47:41,399
like for example at six

733
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:46,140
there's a duty for a common carrier to
fun out there

734
00:47:46,140 --> 00:47:49,328
services are going to be used for
facilitating

735
00:47:49,329 --> 00:47:52,660
betting and wagering to if federal
authorities or law enforcement

736
00:47:52,660 --> 00:47:54,989
authorities notifies them

737
00:47:54,989 --> 00:47:59,440
that the facilities are going to be use
or have been being used for

738
00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:03,390
legal gambling activity they have to
immediately stop providing

739
00:48:03,390 --> 00:48:07,400
service to the person that's doing have
to give notice but they basically have

740
00:48:07,400 --> 00:48:08,650
to comply

741
00:48:08,650 --> 00:48:12,319
now this new bill extends that
obligation from common carriers which

742
00:48:12,319 --> 00:48:17,829
typically phone companies to any
internet computer service provider

743
00:48:17,829 --> 00:48:20,950
which would be your local ISP probably

744
00:48:20,950 --> 00:48:26,009
your localized was almost anybody to be
analyzed

745
00:48:26,009 --> 00:48:29,359
few website you could probably be

746
00:48:29,359 --> 00:48:32,719
Java web server on your machine you
could probably call

747
00:48:32,719 --> 00:48:35,859
exactitude

748
00:48:35,859 --> 00:48:39,390
it does kinda give you little the safe
harbor

749
00:48:39,390 --> 00:48:44,259
harbor to comply with the orders for any
problems because people by

750
00:48:44,259 --> 00:48:47,539
complying with the order but it doesn't
solve the tricky question

751
00:48:47,539 --> 00:48:51,660
well this thing was on my website know
about it

752
00:48:51,660 --> 00:48:54,779
somebody else did it might still be
alive on

753
00:48:54,779 --> 00:48:59,099
sectors no safe harbor

754
00:48:59,099 --> 00:49:02,779
just a random thing that the Gambling
Act this is actually expands

755
00:49:02,779 --> 00:49:06,730
the Rangers activities in all media

756
00:49:06,730 --> 00:49:11,250
are considered used to be pretty narrow
betting on sports or

757
00:49:11,250 --> 00:49:15,089
sports events are contests now it's
kinda anything that doesn't fall into a

758
00:49:15,089 --> 00:49:16,828
few different categories

759
00:49:16,829 --> 00:49:21,789
and anything that's you might want to
have a contract that bets on the outcome

760
00:49:21,789 --> 00:49:23,460
of something

761
00:49:23,460 --> 00:49:26,739
that is in the stock in this insurance
contract that would be considered

762
00:49:26,739 --> 00:49:27,440
gambling

763
00:49:27,440 --> 00:49:30,839
this new law there's a lot of things
occur for

764
00:49:30,839 --> 00:49:35,269
finally there's a first amendment
problem with this bill

765
00:49:35,269 --> 00:49:38,390
the existing gambling legislation
already criminalizes providing

766
00:49:38,390 --> 00:49:40,170
information to assist

767
00:49:40,170 --> 00:49:44,880
thats measures but this new Act

768
00:49:44,880 --> 00:49:47,469
to me there's a personal problem that
right there that's been challenge

769
00:49:47,469 --> 00:49:50,259
seriously

770
00:49:50,259 --> 00:49:53,910
because providing information that is in
used obviously

771
00:49:53,910 --> 00:49:58,558
its just a crime that's that's free
speech as far as I'm concerned

772
00:49:58,559 --> 00:50:01,779
and the new act kinda recognizes a piece
that by providing

773
00:50:01,779 --> 00:50:04,839
expose the exception for news reporting
about the place the bets

774
00:50:04,839 --> 00:50:09,519
as not being criminalised this law that
just kind of begs the question what

775
00:50:09,519 --> 00:50:11,440
about everything that isn't news

776
00:50:11,440 --> 00:50:14,519
that is clearly involved in the crime

777
00:50:14,519 --> 00:50:19,819
as a law broad range of free speech the
problem spill

778
00:50:19,819 --> 00:50:23,509
which probably go down the list all the
twenty or thirty bills and fine

779
00:50:23,509 --> 00:50:28,210
particular constitutional problems one
is

780
00:50:28,210 --> 00:50:33,579
to take a look at these things and get
involved findings concern

781
00:50:33,579 --> 00:50:36,890
slater's groups like bTW CDT

782
00:50:36,890 --> 00:50:40,799
ACLU make sure things happen rising

783
00:50:40,799 --> 00:50:47,799
going to jail for should thanks a lot

784
00:50:51,460 --> 00:50:58,460
taking questions i right especially if
teachers

785
00:51:01,860 --> 00:51:05,310
as a microphone by the slide projector
think we've been a junk email the lord

786
00:51:05,310 --> 00:51:05,710
please

787
00:51:05,710 --> 00:51:09,680
it's got the best art Q&A

788
00:51:09,680 --> 00:51:14,710
more detail if we put a picture for spam

789
00:51:14,710 --> 00:51:19,200
been sued by Hormel I with we thought
about that

790
00:51:19,200 --> 00:51:23,810
first question

791
00:51:23,810 --> 00:51:26,920
um to any the present bills address the

792
00:51:26,920 --> 00:51:33,410
issue of steganography directly that's a
good question

793
00:51:33,410 --> 00:51:36,440
steganography actually pretty doesn't
know is the art

794
00:51:36,440 --> 00:51:40,120
hiding a message inside something else
that doesn't look like the message

795
00:51:40,120 --> 00:51:43,529
programs likes to go and so forth
actually hiding

796
00:51:43,530 --> 00:51:48,120
message inside a graphic him well know
it was she will consider fuzziness are

797
00:51:48,120 --> 00:51:50,490
white noise see send a graphic to
somebody

798
00:51:50,490 --> 00:51:54,790
and people who are observing the
transmission from you got a person

799
00:51:54,790 --> 00:51:58,230
all they see is a graphic but the person
at the other end actually extract a

800
00:51:58,230 --> 00:51:58,930
message

801
00:51:58,930 --> 00:52:02,570
from the noise in the picture on the
answers I don't know

802
00:52:02,570 --> 00:52:06,930
steganography is one the encryption is
Street corruption

803
00:52:06,930 --> 00:52:10,800
has been the focus on all edges lation I
don't remember it steganography comes in

804
00:52:10,800 --> 00:52:15,010
well I don't think any the bills record
specifically mention

805
00:52:15,010 --> 00:52:18,770
definition of corruption that's being
used in these bills is

806
00:52:18,770 --> 00:52:24,020
clearly brought covers singer for using
captured define

807
00:52:24,020 --> 00:52:29,800
do you have a favorite stay connected
saying graphic program prolly as tools

808
00:52:29,800 --> 00:52:36,010
Estel I wasn't for me one

809
00:52:36,010 --> 00:52:40,880
as a bird is in line for a teacher next
or

810
00:52:40,880 --> 00:52:45,910
are does the pennsylvania law any you
serve any crypto

811
00:52:45,910 --> 00:52:49,680
what's a 128

812
00:52:49,680 --> 00:52:52,860
rc4 is just

813
00:52:52,860 --> 00:52:56,530
hi your data just using can you posed
another

814
00:52:56,530 --> 00:53:01,460
like

815
00:53:01,460 --> 00:53:06,690
up the Pennsylvania code is an excerpt
from

816
00:53:06,690 --> 00:53:09,900
doesn't specifically addressing
corruption ID

817
00:53:09,900 --> 00:53:14,730
dresses basically hardware/software

818
00:53:14,730 --> 00:53:17,800
information plans related

819
00:53:17,800 --> 00:53:21,190
to anything that could be used for the
unauthorized access to

820
00:53:21,190 --> 00:53:22,750
telecommunications services

821
00:53:22,750 --> 00:53:26,860
it's pretty broad be be at least and

822
00:53:26,860 --> 00:53:31,420
but doesn't dress doesn't dress that
bakery corruption at all

823
00:53:31,420 --> 00:53:34,710
there's far as I know well it does

824
00:53:34,710 --> 00:53:37,810
it does it does address just doesn't
address specifically

825
00:53:37,810 --> 00:53:40,880
Christian it does provide

826
00:53:40,880 --> 00:53:46,270
from counties for any for change

827
00:53:46,270 --> 00:53:50,470
basically concealing the

828
00:53:50,470 --> 00:53:53,970
originate or for

829
00:53:53,970 --> 00:53:59,010
receiver up electronic communication so

830
00:53:59,010 --> 00:54:02,570
if you if you cryptid I

831
00:54:02,570 --> 00:54:07,270
if you encrypt a file

832
00:54:07,270 --> 00:54:12,110
that had your identity and past that

833
00:54:12,110 --> 00:54:16,490
file some and law enforcement found that
file

834
00:54:16,490 --> 00:54:21,410
using part castigation the fact that you
used software

835
00:54:21,410 --> 00:54:24,629
to encrypt your identity file could
conceivably

836
00:54:24,630 --> 00:54:28,060
use to build a case against you so

837
00:54:28,060 --> 00:54:32,180
if these all sound like a logical
stretches you're right but

838
00:54:32,180 --> 00:54:37,130
I learn from experience my case that
that prosecutors are masters at

839
00:54:37,130 --> 00:54:38,590
stretching these definitions

840
00:54:38,590 --> 00:54:41,770
even though they're really big the
stretch them even beyond

841
00:54:41,770 --> 00:54:46,100
the rounds that be so don't say well
it's so big

842
00:54:46,100 --> 00:54:49,840
is good come to that stretch teenage
these people are mastered

843
00:54:49,840 --> 00:54:53,040
so dump

844
00:54:53,040 --> 00:54:56,160
passenger trains you

845
00:54:56,160 --> 00:55:00,250
think thank you antique rebuttal
legislation sorry books

846
00:55:00,250 --> 00:55:03,580
3 you can generally expect

847
00:55:03,580 --> 00:55:07,180
everything shows up federal laws to be
introduced many

848
00:55:07,180 --> 00:55:12,690
status things yes

849
00:55:12,690 --> 00:55:17,030
the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania already
has privacy laws

850
00:55:17,030 --> 00:55:21,970
purses like when you get arrested for
DUI

851
00:55:21,970 --> 00:55:25,260
you have the option not take the tests
considered

852
00:55:25,260 --> 00:55:28,650
your personal biopsy but then they
automatically considered

853
00:55:28,650 --> 00:55:33,200
guilty of the crime and you end up
getting

854
00:55:33,200 --> 00:55:36,870
worse then if you just taken a test in
failed it

855
00:55:36,870 --> 00:55:41,210
what's to keep them from doing the same
thing if they pass a privacy law saying

856
00:55:41,210 --> 00:55:45,460
thats they can we are in crypt it stop

857
00:55:45,460 --> 00:55:49,100
and we will give them the key but

858
00:55:49,100 --> 00:55:52,380
by doing that we automatically say where
guilty

859
00:55:52,380 --> 00:55:55,560
whenever they wanna charges Stephen
Knight

860
00:55:55,560 --> 00:55:59,250
actually three about this this morning

861
00:55:59,250 --> 00:56:03,090
I I had read a I thought that I'd read

862
00:56:03,090 --> 00:56:07,130
one other versions of the same up
legislation

863
00:56:07,130 --> 00:56:10,550
at paragraph have

864
00:56:10,550 --> 00:56:15,640
up I seem to remember reading something
in at least one be

865
00:56:15,640 --> 00:56:19,920
incarnations desi legislation that
criminal penalties

866
00:56:19,920 --> 00:56:23,910
a federal felony federal felony to
refused to provide

867
00:56:23,910 --> 00:56:28,339
friction keys to a law enforcement
agency if they had

868
00:56:28,340 --> 00:56:32,280
I'll for to search for

869
00:56:32,280 --> 00:56:36,930
on apparently it's a little more
specific

870
00:56:36,930 --> 00:56:40,310
when I read as unlawful use friction

871
00:56:40,310 --> 00:56:44,960
for said tightly I see section 2805

872
00:56:44,960 --> 00:56:49,330
United States federal criminal statutes
title 18 United States Code Title 18

873
00:56:49,330 --> 00:56:50,500
section 22

874
00:56:50,500 --> 00:56:54,310
its affiliates not a law I'll cases
proposed bill

875
00:56:54,310 --> 00:56:58,049
that we have a chance to keep this thing
getting getting active

876
00:56:58,050 --> 00:57:01,600
you know when the votes when this is
gonna I can talk about the

877
00:57:01,600 --> 00:57:06,110
the say phil has had for a long time
revision

878
00:57:06,110 --> 00:57:12,100
and it was worked on narrowed by the
ACLU

879
00:57:12,100 --> 00:57:16,760
yeah mean legislative history
legislative history

880
00:57:16,760 --> 00:57:21,620
and less the ACLU you know did a good
job trying to narrow it as much as

881
00:57:21,620 --> 00:57:24,830
possible while still keeping the bill
from getting

882
00:57:24,830 --> 00:57:27,940
and and what's left is there you can
actually go the red

883
00:57:27,940 --> 00:57:32,340
website at www.sec.gov to comment read

884
00:57:32,340 --> 00:57:35,990
and find out learn more about it make
the call yourself

885
00:57:35,990 --> 00:57:39,150
let me read it section 20 25 as proposed

886
00:57:39,150 --> 00:57:44,170
it's entitled unlawful use of encryption
further into the criminal act

887
00:57:44,170 --> 00:57:47,750
doesn't say it done limit that from the
beginning from

888
00:57:47,750 --> 00:57:51,090
are any person willfully uses encryption

889
00:57:51,090 --> 00:57:54,200
in furtherance at the commission of a
criminal offence

890
00:57:54,200 --> 00:57:57,660
for which the person may be prosecuted
in a court of competent jurisdiction

891
00:57:57,660 --> 00:58:04,660
which means any cords that limit the
federal courts I don't think it does

892
00:58:05,750 --> 00:58:09,610
I to bring a separate prosecution

893
00:58:09,610 --> 00:58:12,670
oh yeah if you were charged with some
crime

894
00:58:12,670 --> 00:58:17,080
up it doesn't seem to even limited to
federal offenses or

895
00:58:17,080 --> 00:58:20,310
or family affected guys any crime the
way I read

896
00:58:20,310 --> 00:58:24,380
me ransom lawyer %ah and a search
warrant

897
00:58:24,380 --> 00:58:27,770
to your house rate is come together
magical situation

898
00:58:27,770 --> 00:58:30,920
your house 30 want to rate your house

899
00:58:30,920 --> 00:58:34,890
on because your heart law enforcement
officers with your hard drive

900
00:58:34,890 --> 00:58:38,240
they find gifted file are if you can
charge

901
00:58:38,240 --> 00:58:41,420
any other criminal if you can charge a
criminal offence and the fine

902
00:58:41,420 --> 00:58:44,610
file hard drive up if you

903
00:58:44,610 --> 00:58:49,410
do not if you use encryption on a file
on the hard drive

904
00:58:49,410 --> 00:58:52,850
and furtherance of a crime in the
further I'm however if your fruits

905
00:58:52,850 --> 00:58:53,819
provide

906
00:58:53,820 --> 00:58:58,020
they have to show that the information
in there was used in further into the

907
00:58:58,020 --> 00:58:59,560
commission that crime however

908
00:58:59,560 --> 00:59:02,600
you can bed you can bet your ass that

909
00:59:02,600 --> 00:59:07,180
that if you cannot provide action keys
for that file on your hard drive

910
00:59:07,180 --> 00:59:10,680
they will say that information was used
in the

911
00:59:10,680 --> 00:59:13,740
further as a technician crime back you
did

912
00:59:13,740 --> 00:59:17,490
provided the keys almost up almost prove
that fact

913
00:59:17,490 --> 00:59:20,990
on he sells think that sounds like a
stretch to you he had only

914
00:59:20,990 --> 00:59:24,210
people style good so the

915
00:59:24,210 --> 00:59:28,230
we should special anyone answer that
which is in the goal that is too

916
00:59:28,230 --> 00:59:32,320
take people that for example winning

917
00:59:32,320 --> 00:59:35,950
information relating to the criminal act
there committee

918
00:59:35,950 --> 00:59:39,920
and use it to try and avoid prosecution
and down

919
00:59:39,920 --> 00:59:45,650
I think it's unnecessary to be honest
yes

920
00:59:45,650 --> 00:59:49,920
okay it's great that they're doing all
this talking about making these laws in

921
00:59:49,920 --> 00:59:51,160
that kinda thing

922
00:59:51,160 --> 00:59:55,819
but in the days when any two-bit where's
happy with the DC computer connection

923
00:59:55,820 --> 00:59:59,270
unit three hundred and fifty dollar
happy a Photoshop for free

924
00:59:59,270 --> 01:00:03,500
how they plan to enforce all this stuff
so you're saying like

925
01:00:03,500 --> 01:00:07,580
house copyright forcible on the Internet
no I'm saying the copyright

926
01:00:07,580 --> 01:00:11,529
obviously isn't enforceable on the
Internet so how are these laws to be

927
01:00:11,530 --> 01:00:12,120
enforceable

928
01:00:12,120 --> 01:00:16,700
on the Internet very selectively same as
any other law how many

929
01:00:16,700 --> 01:00:21,840
fare beaters catcher

930
01:00:21,840 --> 01:00:26,390
the come here is a very hard issue

931
01:00:26,390 --> 01:00:29,819
for a lot of people to figure out how a
translation

932
01:00:29,820 --> 01:00:33,210
and when you point out is exactly why

933
01:00:33,210 --> 01:00:36,920
because it's not clear that in a world
we can make an exact duplicate

934
01:00:36,920 --> 01:00:41,350
anything millions of times have a cost
you know more than the first copy

935
01:00:41,350 --> 01:00:44,529
it's not clear copyright works the same
way

936
01:00:44,530 --> 01:00:48,680
and the counter side this is the you
know if for any rights

937
01:00:48,680 --> 01:00:52,280
PC software reprogramming your cell
phone anyone

938
01:00:52,280 --> 01:00:56,590
make some money off it as me spend a
couple years or give it away I hope

939
01:00:56,590 --> 01:01:01,240
yeah his want to give it away you also
sell it for 50 bucks a copy

940
01:01:01,240 --> 01:01:04,360
he's is probably got a right to be
compensated for it but you know

941
01:01:04,360 --> 01:01:08,030
how does that work is not clear

942
01:01:08,030 --> 01:01:11,550
next just a small common one Burns said

943
01:01:11,550 --> 01:01:14,760
as a example selecting this Worthington
lows

944
01:01:14,760 --> 01:01:19,680
applied the republican People's Republic
of China

945
01:01:19,680 --> 01:01:23,540
does not allow anybody and access to the

946
01:01:23,540 --> 01:01:28,410
al got higher news

947
01:01:28,410 --> 01:01:32,990
just went with the teacher

948
01:01:32,990 --> 01:01:36,230
I yeah I read about legislation

949
01:01:36,230 --> 01:01:41,600
thats flying to be enforced on gambling
on the internet

950
01:01:41,600 --> 01:01:44,660
a by

951
01:01:44,660 --> 01:01:48,279
jurisdiction by according to where you
live

952
01:01:48,280 --> 01:01:51,470
like if you're in this state that
doesn't allow

953
01:01:51,470 --> 01:01:55,780
gambling it would be illegal for you to
gamble

954
01:01:55,780 --> 01:02:00,750
in see mom biggest wherever it is legal

955
01:02:00,750 --> 01:02:04,500
on but it's the World Wide Web

956
01:02:04,500 --> 01:02:07,890
so wherever you go I mean

957
01:02:07,890 --> 01:02:11,830
how to them how did the plan to enforce

958
01:02:11,830 --> 01:02:15,900
that's about as stupid as as trying to
censor the

959
01:02:15,900 --> 01:02:18,950
internet using the you know

960
01:02:18,950 --> 01:02:23,450
communications decency exactly right in
fact if you look at our website or web

961
01:02:23,450 --> 01:02:25,520
sites WWW dot

962
01:02:25,520 --> 01:02:29,500
bTW CTR or

963
01:02:29,500 --> 01:02:33,980
you'll see we did a a run down a bit at
the case in Minnesota

964
01:02:33,980 --> 01:02:37,210
where they actually tried to drag the
owner of a gambling website

965
01:02:37,210 --> 01:02:40,440
in believes important Minnesota

966
01:02:40,440 --> 01:02:44,500
they had no assets in Minnesota the
owners had never been in Minnesota

967
01:02:44,500 --> 01:02:49,020
and as far as I can tell

968
01:02:49,020 --> 01:02:53,259
bTW CTR .org bTW CTR

969
01:02:53,260 --> 01:02:56,280
there's never been a Minnesota but they
decided because gambling was illegal in

970
01:02:56,280 --> 01:02:57,090
Minnesota

971
01:02:57,090 --> 01:03:00,100
I was on the web that it would be a
prime minister

972
01:03:00,100 --> 01:03:03,350
you know what the and Italy squad

973
01:03:03,350 --> 01:03:06,759
all they did was prevent those people
who own work gambling server

974
01:03:06,760 --> 01:03:09,950
from vacationing in in Minnesota it's
all ages

975
01:03:09,950 --> 01:03:13,800
actually forcible Nessa people say about
this gambling

976
01:03:13,800 --> 01:03:18,300
knows that it's absurd is set up
actually trying to

977
01:03:18,300 --> 01:03:21,410
restrict gambling on the internet you
should just you know

978
01:03:21,410 --> 01:03:28,410
addressing as a it's gonna happen as it
is

979
01:03:31,510 --> 01:03:38,500
missing at:

980
01:03:38,500 --> 01:03:42,640
testing that

981
01:03:42,640 --> 01:03:46,040
that would be the equivalent you know if
I want to take a vacation

982
01:03:46,040 --> 01:03:49,720
Vegas me when I'm using the internet
that's basically what I'm doing I'm

983
01:03:49,720 --> 01:03:50,549
taking myself

984
01:03:50,549 --> 01:03:55,020
there yeah I think I'll this
jurisdictional stuff is absurd

985
01:03:55,020 --> 01:04:00,109
these long four days you seem to wanna
like stretch their jurisdiction

986
01:04:00,109 --> 01:04:00,759
everywhere

987
01:04:00,760 --> 01:04:06,130
everywhere they can possibly do it and
like I said if if the long course mangia

988
01:04:06,130 --> 01:04:11,510
as target mine individual target they
will stretch the definition to these

989
01:04:11,510 --> 01:04:12,099
laws

990
01:04:12,099 --> 01:04:15,740
as much as they can get away with it and
even if woody

991
01:04:15,740 --> 01:04:19,460
get away with it is unconstitutional you
have to then challenged

992
01:04:19,460 --> 01:04:22,680
shit time money lots of money

993
01:04:22,680 --> 01:04:27,380
good lawyers and to Big Boi

994
01:04:27,380 --> 01:04:31,290
I'll if sometime in the future

995
01:04:31,290 --> 01:04:34,430
the law enforcement community force

996
01:04:34,430 --> 01:04:39,049
provide them with your key would it be
possible to

997
01:04:39,049 --> 01:04:42,339
create in which you could

998
01:04:42,339 --> 01:04:45,980
take the fifth amendment and not provide
them with it

999
01:04:45,980 --> 01:04:49,630
so your key would be like I hacked the
pentagon all

1000
01:04:49,630 --> 01:04:54,609
at soccer something where where you
decorate yourself by giving them the key

1001
01:04:54,609 --> 01:04:57,970
so clever say would have to go

1002
01:04:57,970 --> 01:05:03,819
I wrestling good question as a good
teacher

1003
01:05:03,819 --> 01:05:07,900
well I don't know if you're going to get
us all ass

1004
01:05:07,900 --> 01:05:11,150
there's different categories

1005
01:05:11,150 --> 01:05:13,910
things towards the fifth amendment
applies in this tell you the way

1006
01:05:13,910 --> 01:05:15,700
lawrence where I think it should be

1007
01:05:15,700 --> 01:05:20,650
things that are

1008
01:05:20,650 --> 01:05:24,880
communicated things to take the first
amendment

1009
01:05:24,880 --> 01:05:28,760
but things like giving a sample with
your hair court has ruled

1010
01:05:28,760 --> 01:05:33,450
you can take the first about one piece
get to the question is

1011
01:05:33,450 --> 01:05:36,750
isn't encryption key more like error
more like speech

1012
01:05:36,750 --> 01:05:40,819
we don't really know you Gracia like
works out core

1013
01:05:40,819 --> 01:05:46,109
as pretty hairy arm

1014
01:05:46,109 --> 01:05:49,290
you mentioned a a ban on strong crypto

1015
01:05:49,290 --> 01:05:54,890
with that just they couldn't throw
everyone in jail

1016
01:05:54,890 --> 01:05:58,160
uses pgp so what they do

1017
01:05:58,160 --> 01:06:02,230
pages well first thing that they would
do would be make sure that no one sold

1018
01:06:02,230 --> 01:06:03,099
commercially

1019
01:06:03,099 --> 01:06:06,790
and so now all the commercial products
that you enjoy like

1020
01:06:06,790 --> 01:06:13,259
stuff but out now by PGP as a company
the stuff by netscape even Microsoft if

1021
01:06:13,260 --> 01:06:15,150
you happen to be in and explore user

1022
01:06:15,150 --> 01:06:18,369
you couldn't get the internet would
revert to shareware

1023
01:06:18,369 --> 01:06:22,569
crypto and thats that's the world we
don't want to be in it's a world where

1024
01:06:22,569 --> 01:06:23,759
only the people in this room

1025
01:06:23,760 --> 01:06:27,220
be getting friction Civil War my mother
your sister

1026
01:06:27,220 --> 01:06:30,609
your brother know those people crypto
and that means that

1027
01:06:30,609 --> 01:06:37,220
were smaller target prosecutable going

1028
01:06:37,220 --> 01:06:40,500
going back to what you said a moment ago
gambling's Minnesota

1029
01:06:40,500 --> 01:06:44,339
talk much a restriction on issues I mean
just comment

1030
01:06:44,339 --> 01:06:47,759
timely question but what about the case
the attraction yes

1031
01:06:47,760 --> 01:06:51,099
California he went to jail

1032
01:06:51,099 --> 01:06:55,530
exactly be he was help when the ship
mark Tennessee

1033
01:06:55,530 --> 01:07:00,670
it happens there's also something more
complicated IBM interaction case

1034
01:07:00,670 --> 01:07:02,089
including the the mailing

1035
01:07:02,089 --> 01:07:05,950
restricted material interstate

1036
01:07:05,950 --> 01:07:10,150
and that's really what was that some
portland is a killer in that case

1037
01:07:10,150 --> 01:07:13,619
right a the most important thing

1038
01:07:13,619 --> 01:07:17,079
is the most important thing I get ask
because the message that

1039
01:07:17,079 --> 01:07:21,380
I'm really taking away from all this is
that activism is needed

1040
01:07:21,380 --> 01:07:25,349
desperately and the people in this room

1041
01:07:25,349 --> 01:07:28,420
represent a segment of society that has

1042
01:07:28,420 --> 01:07:32,410
a where extremely high concentration of
technical knowledge

1043
01:07:32,410 --> 01:07:36,130
unfortunately though that doesn't
necessarily imply anything about our

1044
01:07:36,130 --> 01:07:38,210
communication skills and our ability

1045
01:07:38,210 --> 01:07:41,900
to a communicate this to affect change

1046
01:07:41,900 --> 01:07:45,700
in the political system thus far is a
where you mentioned about adopting

1047
01:07:45,700 --> 01:07:49,069
our legislators and communicate
communicating

1048
01:07:49,069 --> 01:07:53,359
educating trying to change opinions a I
think that

1049
01:07:53,359 --> 01:07:56,940
myself a the people in this room could
really benefit from

1050
01:07:56,940 --> 01:07:59,960
so guidance as far well

1051
01:07:59,960 --> 01:08:03,359
really empower us to some guidance as to

1052
01:08:03,359 --> 01:08:07,140
were argument what are the arguments
that we can make

1053
01:08:07,140 --> 01:08:11,240
how can we a try to explain

1054
01:08:11,240 --> 01:08:14,510
how we tried to disarm a

1055
01:08:14,510 --> 01:08:17,830
the people of who are obviously panicked
by

1056
01:08:17,830 --> 01:08:22,698
this technology we try to educate happen
we try to edit for me happy we try to

1057
01:08:22,699 --> 01:08:24,339
effect positive change

1058
01:08:24,339 --> 01:08:28,500
one things that you'll see you going to
the doctor legislator

1059
01:08:28,500 --> 01:08:32,170
program page trip to Dakar is that we

1060
01:08:32,170 --> 01:08:35,830
give you type in your zip code we give
you member congress'

1061
01:08:35,830 --> 01:08:40,488
local and DC phone numbers we give you
pointers to documents

1062
01:08:40,489 --> 01:08:44,170
that you can use as evidence as to why
/strong corruption is important

1063
01:08:44,170 --> 01:08:47,980
and then we could be talking points no
stress these points when you talk to

1064
01:08:47,980 --> 01:08:48,489
them

1065
01:08:48,489 --> 01:08:51,170
it back if we tell you to go to a town
hall meeting because it's going to be

1066
01:08:51,170 --> 01:08:52,460
one in your district

1067
01:08:52,460 --> 01:08:56,670
will tell you whether or not remember
congress is a supporter or in a poser

1068
01:08:56,670 --> 01:09:00,069
a strong encryption based on their votes
and we'll tell you should you be

1069
01:09:00,069 --> 01:09:03,779
congratulating them with the carrot are
beating them with a stick

1070
01:09:03,779 --> 01:09:08,900
very important freighter

1071
01:09:08,900 --> 01:09:13,449
that's a good question by the way when
first present lock picks a second France

1072
01:09:13,449 --> 01:09:16,540
I

1073
01:09:16,540 --> 01:09:20,229
I suppose my questions really more
metaphysical

1074
01:09:20,230 --> 01:09:24,380
shirt or but just wondering

1075
01:09:24,380 --> 01:09:29,040
anybody here believes it God created
public key encryption system so

1076
01:09:29,040 --> 01:09:32,250
style good

1077
01:09:32,250 --> 01:09:36,259
I

1078
01:09:36,259 --> 01:09:40,259
ish

1079
01:09:40,259 --> 01:09:45,390
next I

1080
01:09:45,390 --> 01:09:50,199
with found out today is there really
happy involved in this process

1081
01:09:50,199 --> 01:09:53,250
getting into legislation before it
happens you know top

1082
01:09:53,250 --> 01:09:57,699
members of congress finding out how
bills go through the system

1083
01:09:57,699 --> 01:10:03,310
we also found out as very expensive must
be done not for us individually but as

1084
01:10:03,310 --> 01:10:06,570
as a group to keep us informed

1085
01:10:06,570 --> 01:10:09,980
and I'll I think she'll do is take a
look at our

1086
01:10:09,980 --> 01:10:14,190
pocketbooks and see if spare few books

1087
01:10:14,190 --> 01:10:17,360
donations these groups really held

1088
01:10:17,360 --> 01:10:20,360
going to do that we don't accept
donations down

1089
01:10:20,360 --> 01:10:23,949
now I handed if you

1090
01:10:23,949 --> 01:10:27,850
I stay honest to god we have thought
about taking like 20

1091
01:10:27,850 --> 01:10:31,920
forty dollars donations and we've
included at the bookkeeping

1092
01:10:31,920 --> 01:10:35,219
taking track keeping track money was not
really worth it

1093
01:10:35,219 --> 01:10:38,330
compared to you if once a month

1094
01:10:38,330 --> 01:10:42,090
you call your member congress we sent
you an email

1095
01:10:42,090 --> 01:10:46,830
and did that and/or call spoke to a
staffer explain in writing fiction that

1096
01:10:46,830 --> 01:10:47,540
is worth

1097
01:10:47,540 --> 01:10:52,280
hundreds of dollars you can imagine the
stories I've got about someone called

1098
01:10:52,280 --> 01:10:55,910

1099
01:10:55,910 --> 01:10:59,230
yes actually example we do fundraisers

1100
01:10:59,230 --> 01:11:03,120

to the New York state law suit went to

1101
01:11:03,120 --> 01:11:03,469

concerned about this issue you make a

1106
01:11:16,960 --> 01:11:19,370
commitment to call your member congress

1107
01:11:19,370 --> 01:11:23,210
and talk to them or talk to the staff
about encryption that's worth more than

1108
01:11:23,210 --> 01:11:23,730

1109
01:11:23,730 --> 01:11:26,940
