1
00:00:01,230 --> 00:00:04,670
good everybody it's time for the
MetroCard

2
00:00:04,670 --> 00:00:07,879
discussion I suppose up red

3
00:00:07,879 --> 00:00:11,570
red Telecom is gonna be speaking he has
won her place and that is

4
00:00:11,570 --> 00:00:14,700
if you are taking this are taking
pictures or recording if it goes on

5
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:15,880
broadcast television

6
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:19,050
pics like the voice and pics like that
base

7
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:23,199
and change the voice I he's coming here
shortly

8
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:30,199
his fighting apparently and will be
speaking from the middle of the room

9
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:33,950
and you here comes

10
00:00:33,950 --> 00:00:40,950
everybody be happy the

11
00:00:55,690 --> 00:00:57,949
good morning

12
00:00:57,950 --> 00:01:03,180
as you can tell I'm red dollar clobber
so named for my

13
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:10,180
the face here I i have heard that I was
supposed to be the first speaker today

14
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:17,060
and when I heard that I had also heard
from Emmanuel Goldstein

15
00:01:17,060 --> 00:01:21,580
that we had a request from the Christian
Broadcasting Network

16
00:01:21,580 --> 00:01:25,580
that we have services since it is the
Lord's Day so

17
00:01:25,580 --> 00:01:28,789
we're going to oblige them brothers and
sisters

18
00:01:28,790 --> 00:01:33,149
and since this is the house of the LORD
temporarily I

19
00:01:33,149 --> 00:01:38,470
I'd like to ask everybody wearing a cap
take it off and it's just going to be a

20
00:01:38,470 --> 00:01:41,210
very very short bible reading

21
00:01:41,210 --> 00:01:44,830
from Revelation

22
00:01:44,830 --> 00:01:50,899
revelation 13

23
00:01:50,899 --> 00:01:57,899
let me just get everything out
revelation 13

24
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:03,630
mmm but no ma'am

25
00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:07,180
would be allowed to buy nor sell

26
00:02:07,180 --> 00:02:11,890
except that he had the mark of the beast
upon his forehead

27
00:02:11,890 --> 00:02:16,739
than the mark of the beast in his right
hand

28
00:02:16,739 --> 00:02:23,739
the the thank you for coming to this
Bible reading

29
00:02:29,110 --> 00:02:36,110
now on with my talk

30
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:40,360
as you know I

31
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:46,590
gave the talk last time around it hope
on the metro card which at the time was

32
00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:47,700
the blue one

33
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:52,990
when that went over well and we knew a
few things about it and we had to read

34
00:02:52,990 --> 00:02:54,040
an awful lot

35
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:57,299
but what we had read was mostly

36
00:02:57,300 --> 00:03:00,530
news the items not too much in the way o

37
00:03:00,530 --> 00:03:04,209
internal documents even though

38
00:03:04,209 --> 00:03:08,690
some love you know that I would have
some access to internal documents

39
00:03:08,690 --> 00:03:13,450
wants a half-mile since then

40
00:03:13,450 --> 00:03:17,350
we've managed to come across lots of
interesting things and done

41
00:03:17,350 --> 00:03:22,140
a few mild and I stress the word mild
experiments

42
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:26,270
those of you who think that you're going
to learn how to go home

43
00:03:26,270 --> 00:03:30,090
and the learn how to make imitation
matter cards are learning how to put

44
00:03:30,090 --> 00:03:33,010
fifteen thousand dollars on the metro
card you have

45
00:03:33,010 --> 00:03:38,890
are really sorely mistaken I know

46
00:03:38,890 --> 00:03:43,840
okay the heart of the matter card

47
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:47,840
is a US patent it happens to be

48
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:54,840
number five million 298,000 726 issued
March 29th the ninety-four

49
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:58,600
to a man named Kenneth

50
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:01,940
are all operating who will probably
works for cubic

51
00:04:01,940 --> 00:04:05,299
but I do love the patent is fare card

52
00:04:05,299 --> 00:04:09,560
reader/writer which overwrites oldest or
invalid data

53
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:15,230
it's been a sight to cubic automatic
revenue collection group which you know

54
00:04:15,230 --> 00:04:16,810
is the people that make

55
00:04:16,810 --> 00:04:21,530
MetroCard turnstiles and the MetroCard
proper

56
00:04:21,530 --> 00:04:27,370
it's really an ingenious system and even
though patents are pretty damn up to use

57
00:04:27,370 --> 00:04:33,940
and this one is no exception if you
listen carefully and it is unfortunately

58
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:36,719
much longer than I wanna read by gonna
read it anyway

59
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:41,950
if you listen carefully it comes out how
ingenious this thing actually is

60
00:04:41,950 --> 00:04:45,210
abstract and

61
00:04:45,210 --> 00:04:48,930
access control ticket having three
fields of data

62
00:04:48,930 --> 00:04:53,430
a first feel they've fixed data a second
feel the variable

63
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:56,510
data and a third feel the variable data
up

64
00:04:56,510 --> 00:05:00,669
I I'm not consistent I have to say is
red

65
00:05:00,669 --> 00:05:03,909
and information processed by a
microprocessor

66
00:05:03,910 --> 00:05:08,599
this tells us what we had suspected
those are you over at the first hope

67
00:05:08,599 --> 00:05:10,250
remember bill itself

68
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:15,789
the hacker who successfully the yessir
give bill a hand even though he's not

69
00:05:15,789 --> 00:05:16,240
here

70
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:20,599
maze wanna

71
00:05:20,599 --> 00:05:24,930
the the hackers who successfully the
defeat at the BART

72
00:05:24,930 --> 00:05:31,930
the Bay Area Rapid Transit card in San
Francisco

73
00:05:32,110 --> 00:05:36,370
a built determined pretty quickly that
it was

74
00:05:36,370 --> 00:05:40,650
three tracks on the MetroCard unlike

75
00:05:40,650 --> 00:05:45,590
your credit cards in your pocket which
only have two tracks a MetroCard

76
00:05:45,590 --> 00:05:47,240
actually has three

77
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:53,099
the only other device in a access device
the only other card in common use with

78
00:05:53,099 --> 00:05:54,130
three tracks

79
00:05:54,130 --> 00:05:57,930
airline tickets this is why

80
00:05:57,930 --> 00:06:03,370
it's been so difficult for us to get our
hands on a three track reader

81
00:06:03,370 --> 00:06:07,030
or three track reader/writer there
aren't that many

82
00:06:07,030 --> 00:06:12,099
out there you don't find them
second-hand I'm sure every third person

83
00:06:12,099 --> 00:06:13,409
in the audience

84
00:06:13,409 --> 00:06:18,620
has a a discarded or even bought
legitimately

85
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:23,000
credit card reader which you've hooked
up to your PC in landlord or York's or

86
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:23,570
scope

87
00:06:23,570 --> 00:06:26,710
and look that those are easy to come by

88
00:06:26,710 --> 00:06:31,330
three tracks much more difficult back to
the parent

89
00:06:31,330 --> 00:06:36,400
the microprocessor determines the
validity of information on the ticket

90
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:37,320
data fields

91
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:40,590
in which to the variable fields has
older data

92
00:06:40,590 --> 00:06:46,400
writing only occurs on or over the
variable field with the invalid or older

93
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:47,010
data

94
00:06:47,010 --> 00:06:50,320
upon subsequent use

95
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:53,880
the ticket contains current axis data
just written

96
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:58,479
and last previous access data as Los
fixed field data

97
00:06:58,479 --> 00:07:03,839
this added data past views can be used
for statistical analysis or other

98
00:07:03,839 --> 00:07:04,680
purposes

99
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:08,659
more importantly the added data field
reduces

100
00:07:08,659 --> 00:07:11,710
review right reliability problems

101
00:07:11,710 --> 00:07:16,690
one improperly written variable data
field does not invalidate the ticket

102
00:07:16,690 --> 00:07:19,729
only the last variable data entry

103
00:07:19,729 --> 00:07:24,360
the microprocessors programs over right
invalid data in one is a variable data

104
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:27,770
fields during the next use

105
00:07:27,770 --> 00:07:32,830
overall a MetroCard tends to be
self-correcting

106
00:07:32,830 --> 00:07:36,200
if there's a minor error it's no problem

107
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:40,700
if it's an error on not the data for
your last use

108
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:43,990
but early reviews it's still no problem

109
00:07:43,990 --> 00:07:47,960
it only needs to know perfectly a few
things

110
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:51,200
we're sure that all a turnstile needs to
know

111
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:54,899
is how much money is currently on the
card

112
00:07:54,899 --> 00:07:58,750
what the serial number is that's what we
know

113
00:07:58,750 --> 00:08:03,080
it has to know we're pretty sure
turnstile also house the No

114
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:08,570
of a MetroCard its expiration date

115
00:08:08,570 --> 00:08:11,779
and its start to date this is what

116
00:08:11,779 --> 00:08:16,500
the turnstile past the No there are
three parts to this system there's the

117
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:18,219
turnstile

118
00:08:18,219 --> 00:08:21,460
there's the booth computer and/or

119
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:24,930
area computer I want them together
because

120
00:08:24,930 --> 00:08:28,300
there at the intermediate level for
different purposes

121
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:32,120
and then there's the Transit Authority's
main

122
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:36,349
back to the pan for second term almost
done with this boring P so

123
00:08:36,349 --> 00:08:42,490
for its boring but it gave us a lot of
insight

124
00:08:42,490 --> 00:08:47,070
since the ticket still has the fixed
data field

125
00:08:47,070 --> 00:08:52,260
that's the serial number that's the
expiration date

126
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:55,350
still has the fix them a field and a
prior use

127
00:08:55,350 --> 00:09:00,790
variable data field that's the time you
went through turnstile

128
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:04,860
that's probably the place he went
through a turnstile

129
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:10,649
thats how much was taken off how much is
on the card

130
00:09:10,649 --> 00:09:14,970
no new you back to the tent no human
intervention

131
00:09:14,970 --> 00:09:18,250
repair Oven access control devices

132
00:09:18,250 --> 00:09:23,460
for single failures or new tickets are
required

133
00:09:23,460 --> 00:09:29,339
the location a variable used a can also
be segregated from fixed data to further

134
00:09:29,339 --> 00:09:32,440
enhance reliability

135
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:36,110
you believe very strongly that of these
three tracks

136
00:09:36,110 --> 00:09:39,980
one track is entirely stuff that's
written on

137
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:43,320
new in other words

138
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:47,740
you wouldn't be able really to tell two
cards

139
00:09:47,740 --> 00:09:51,230
a from the same batch from one another

140
00:09:51,230 --> 00:09:54,370
aside from the subtle things like the
serial numbers of

141
00:09:54,370 --> 00:09:59,420
slightly all the things that change

142
00:09:59,420 --> 00:10:05,420
are in one track actually the number
three track

143
00:10:05,420 --> 00:10:10,849
last couple lines apparent the reduction
in failures and tolerance a single

144
00:10:10,850 --> 00:10:13,080
non-recurring errors along

145
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:16,240
allows hand-held swiped type

146
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:20,410
read writers to be utilized for

147
00:10:20,410 --> 00:10:23,680
mass transit applications

148
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:30,680
axis is quick avoiding manual ticket
insertion grabbing transport in return

149
00:10:31,140 --> 00:10:36,839
it's really very ingenious unlike
Washington DC and other transit systems

150
00:10:36,839 --> 00:10:41,140
where the machine has to grab the ticket
out your hand

151
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:44,740
perform in action on it and then return
it to you

152
00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:50,120
the Transit Authority system allows some
tolerance in the Swype speed

153
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:54,160
I know everybody is laughing for
themselves remembering some time when it

154
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:57,709
took them 20 shots to get through the
turnstile

155
00:10:57,709 --> 00:11:03,510
I really hate to say this it was
probably you

156
00:11:03,510 --> 00:11:08,319
you laugh I seen people take twenty or
thirty shots at it

157
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:11,759
somebody else comes along says please
may I

158
00:11:11,759 --> 00:11:15,250
once white the turnstile suddenly

159
00:11:15,250 --> 00:11:19,509
didn't suddenly become lenient or polite

160
00:11:19,509 --> 00:11:24,209
okay let's talk a little about what's
with the MetroCard what's been with the

161
00:11:24,209 --> 00:11:25,889
MetroCard

162
00:11:25,889 --> 00:11:31,540
MetroCard was first introduced in 1994

163
00:11:31,540 --> 00:11:36,149
and when it was introduced it was in a
limited number subway stations

164
00:11:36,149 --> 00:11:40,910
and people kept saying I'm not going to
use it until it's everywhere well it's

165
00:11:40,910 --> 00:11:43,629
now everywhere

166
00:11:43,629 --> 00:11:47,430
and people are using it more and more
especially since the introduction

167
00:11:47,430 --> 00:11:50,600
love transfers

168
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:54,490
when it first came out of course people
said hey

169
00:11:54,490 --> 00:11:57,709
maybe I can hack the MetroCard

170
00:11:57,709 --> 00:12:01,949
people said I'm sure when the token
first came out in 1953

171
00:12:01,949 --> 00:12:06,350
maybe I can hack a token only what they
were saying then instead of pack was

172
00:12:06,350 --> 00:12:11,389
maybe I can get a substitute open or
make a new counterfeit opium

173
00:12:11,389 --> 00:12:15,019
a slight as it's known well

174
00:12:15,019 --> 00:12:19,550
if you're interested in getting free
rides slugs are probably still the way

175
00:12:19,550 --> 00:12:20,410
to go

176
00:12:20,410 --> 00:12:23,670
it's a lot easier it's a lot lower tech

177
00:12:23,670 --> 00:12:27,969
and the odds if you're getting caught
even on a failure

178
00:12:27,970 --> 00:12:31,610
are much better if you're using us like

179
00:12:31,610 --> 00:12:36,740
if using a MetroCard and you try
counterfeit MetroCard every day in it

180
00:12:36,740 --> 00:12:38,879
fails and then you pay

181
00:12:38,879 --> 00:12:42,220
people are creatures of habit sooner or
later they'll say hey

182
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:46,699
at 6 p.m. at this station somebody uses
a camera for adventure

183
00:12:46,699 --> 00:12:50,149
it doesn't work but they keep in trying
it

184
00:12:50,149 --> 00:12:55,610
the first successful hack government
your card was pretty much

185
00:12:55,610 --> 00:13:00,740
a weaker to into its introduction that
sounds shocking but it shows

186
00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:04,350
the hacker mentality here at work

187
00:13:04,350 --> 00:13:08,189
I don't know the person who did it I
don't know his name

188
00:13:08,189 --> 00:13:12,430
I don't know if it all he was a hacker
or called himself on

189
00:13:12,430 --> 00:13:16,189
but the hacker mentality was evident in
this man

190
00:13:16,189 --> 00:13:20,139
he ended up being arrested without a
successful use

191
00:13:20,139 --> 00:13:23,560
well let me rephrase that: it worked

192
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:28,120
to get him into the station
unfortunately for him

193
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:31,430
that's about as far into the station is
he got

194
00:13:31,430 --> 00:13:34,629
what this guy who tried is

195
00:13:34,629 --> 00:13:39,019
he looked at the MetroCard he saw in
magnetic stripe on it

196
00:13:39,019 --> 00:13:42,620
and huge reason to buy analogy he said

197
00:13:42,620 --> 00:13:45,879
T this looks like

198
00:13:45,879 --> 00:13:49,980
magnetic sound recording tape

199
00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:53,240
from what I understand from an article
in The Daily News in March

200
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:58,379
94 he treated it as if it was magnetic
recording tape

201
00:13:58,379 --> 00:14:01,959
he passed through according to the
article a track

202
00:14:01,959 --> 00:14:06,709
reporter and made a duplicate take

203
00:14:06,709 --> 00:14:10,009
he used his legitimate better card
somewhere

204
00:14:10,009 --> 00:14:13,689
and then with this piece a duplicate
tape since you can't pass a piece of

205
00:14:13,689 --> 00:14:15,980
tape through turnstile

206
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:21,800
he glued it to a piece of cardboard used
in a turnstile

207
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:25,290
activated the turnstile walkthrough

208
00:14:25,290 --> 00:14:30,540
and was promptly arrested why there's a
couple leaning on the turnstile couple

209
00:14:30,540 --> 00:14:37,540
turnstiles overuse of guy pass a piece a
cardboard through turnstile

210
00:14:38,850 --> 00:14:42,459
piece a cardboard does look like a
miniature cars far as i know im

211
00:14:42,459 --> 00:14:47,769
tries a cap move to well that failed

212
00:14:47,769 --> 00:14:53,259
the next successful hack government your
card was an in-house job

213
00:14:53,259 --> 00:14:57,839
this was two or three months after that
there would have been April or May

214
00:14:57,839 --> 00:15:03,279
up 94 a railroad clerk which is the
official title

215
00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:08,410
those people in this in the subway token
booth

216
00:15:08,410 --> 00:15:11,490
decided that there was some potential
here

217
00:15:11,490 --> 00:15:15,959
I don't know how many people actually
stare into a token booth up against the

218
00:15:15,959 --> 00:15:17,060
glass

219
00:15:17,060 --> 00:15:21,769
personally I would I wouldn't do that
it's kinda been polite I mean do you go

220
00:15:21,769 --> 00:15:24,180
up to people that you don't know

221
00:15:24,180 --> 00:15:27,470
and just like stare at 'em

222
00:15:27,470 --> 00:15:31,389
see I feel self-conscious but then again
I'm normal

223
00:15:31,389 --> 00:15:34,810
this man is probably a little
self-conscious

224
00:15:34,810 --> 00:15:38,529
star polite thing to do but people do
that and you might do it too

225
00:15:38,529 --> 00:15:42,959
hopefully a bit more casually if you do
it nowadays what you'll see in a token

226
00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:43,959
booth

227
00:15:43,959 --> 00:15:50,649
you'll see a small all about nine by 14

228
00:15:50,649 --> 00:15:55,660
metal box with a computer screen on one
side on a metal pole

229
00:15:55,660 --> 00:16:01,259
you'll see a whole in the board as it's
called that wooden surface on which the

230
00:16:01,259 --> 00:16:04,639
tokens and change are in if you stick
money in the slot

231
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:09,009
the clerks slides the tokens in the
change along and see a hole in it

232
00:16:09,009 --> 00:16:12,279
you won't see the computer the computer
now

233
00:16:12,279 --> 00:16:15,959
because %uh this man who hacked because
this railroad Port

234
00:16:15,959 --> 00:16:20,050
the computer is now in not only in
armored

235
00:16:20,050 --> 00:16:23,670
case which it always was and it's in an
armored case

236
00:16:23,670 --> 00:16:29,139
where all the connections to and from
the computer

237
00:16:29,139 --> 00:16:32,569
are locked as well

238
00:16:32,569 --> 00:16:38,050
the reason is that when it first started
the computer was a big bulky thing

239
00:16:38,050 --> 00:16:41,720
about the size of your average 17 inch
computer monitor

240
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:47,850
fixed keyboard on it inside a stainless
steel case and it was on a big arm it

241
00:16:47,850 --> 00:16:49,620
was a big bulky thing

242
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:56,620
it was probably bigger than this box
with the flaps up

243
00:16:57,519 --> 00:17:01,399
but all the connections were on the back
cover

244
00:17:01,399 --> 00:17:04,559
all the connections could be removed

245
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:09,280
so with this guy did was he had the
hacker mentality

246
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:14,589
he also had criminal mentality buddy at
the hacker mentality and he figured out

247
00:17:14,589 --> 00:17:18,708
which over those connected the booth
computer

248
00:17:18,709 --> 00:17:22,449
to the TA's mainframe computer

249
00:17:22,449 --> 00:17:27,300
and he disconnected it so what do we do
with a passenger came up an ass for

250
00:17:27,300 --> 00:17:28,860
MetroCard is he would

251
00:17:28,860 --> 00:17:32,650
make up a MetroCard you had the
appropriate keys on the computer

252
00:17:32,650 --> 00:17:34,800
keyboard

253
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:38,370
in those days you it's swipe the card
across much like

254
00:17:38,370 --> 00:17:42,470
turnstile on the booth computer

255
00:17:42,470 --> 00:17:45,840
and it would encode the for the card

256
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:49,600
and he'd sell the card now if the
customer

257
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:55,440
decided to swipe it on the external
party reader to the booth

258
00:17:55,440 --> 00:18:00,740
the computer supervising that external
card reader was born in the booth

259
00:18:00,740 --> 00:18:04,080
it would show it's a perfectly valid
card

260
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:08,699
him if the passenger walks 10 feet
slighted on the freestanding

261
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:11,720
card reader same thing because

262
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:17,530
the computer in the booth is the
computer controlling that card reader

263
00:18:17,530 --> 00:18:22,870
what would happen is passenger with then
go to a turnstile

264
00:18:22,870 --> 00:18:26,230
use it it would work

265
00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:30,750
however this is where the system starts
getting ingenious improve for the

266
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:33,950
ingenuity can be found

267
00:18:33,950 --> 00:18:37,140
approximately every six minutes

268
00:18:37,140 --> 00:18:41,630
all this apparatus that the transit
authority has all this apparatus that

269
00:18:41,630 --> 00:18:45,870
cost a total of nine hundred million
dollars

270
00:18:45,870 --> 00:18:50,040
you heard that right close to a billion
dollars in for Karcher

271
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:53,850
technology in your subway system

272
00:18:53,850 --> 00:18:57,640
would communicate with one another would
go up

273
00:18:57,640 --> 00:19:02,080
to the next level in other words if it
was the booth computer

274
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:07,679
towards the area controller it was the
area controller would go up to the

275
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:08,750
mainframe

276
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:12,780
and it would things would come back down
information

277
00:19:12,780 --> 00:19:17,290
turnstile would say to the area
controller computer

278
00:19:17,290 --> 00:19:20,360
okay I just saw this

279
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:23,520
fare card serial number for argument
sake

280
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:29,620
01 it had a total of three dollars on it

281
00:19:29,620 --> 00:19:33,430
I deducted a buck 50 it now has about 50
on it

282
00:19:33,430 --> 00:19:36,570
remember we're talking about this fake
well

283
00:19:36,570 --> 00:19:40,429
not fake this metric part that was made
up on a computer that was not

284
00:19:40,430 --> 00:19:45,870
communicating directly to the mainframe

285
00:19:45,870 --> 00:19:51,270
this information we get to the mainframe
the mainframe would say wait a minute

286
00:19:51,270 --> 00:19:55,260
I just heard from the booth computer the
booth computer has never seen this

287
00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:56,520
matter card

288
00:19:56,520 --> 00:20:00,158
the reason being the guy in the booth
had disconnected the wiring

289
00:20:00,159 --> 00:20:05,539
that went from the booth computer to the
mainframe

290
00:20:05,539 --> 00:20:08,919
the mainframe would say I've never seen
this matter card

291
00:20:08,919 --> 00:20:13,770
it never happen he added to it next time
you see it

292
00:20:13,770 --> 00:20:17,889
treated as if it's no good don't accept
that

293
00:20:17,890 --> 00:20:22,169
and it would send that out to all the
turnstiles

294
00:20:22,169 --> 00:20:25,630
this is how it works if you have

295
00:20:25,630 --> 00:20:29,809
a MetroCard with the illegitimate serial
number

296
00:20:29,809 --> 00:20:34,029
if you have a MetroCard were something
like this has happened

297
00:20:34,029 --> 00:20:37,460
each turnstile has a list

298
00:20:37,460 --> 00:20:40,789
up match for cards his serial numbers
are invalid

299
00:20:40,789 --> 00:20:43,860
it won't work

300
00:20:43,860 --> 00:20:46,880
in addition each turnstile reads

301
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:50,909
the ballot times on my part for example
there's

302
00:20:50,909 --> 00:20:54,140
student MetroCards good old lease from 5
a.m.

303
00:20:54,140 --> 00:20:59,159
like 9pm you come down at 9:30

304
00:20:59,159 --> 00:21:04,220
all it needs to do is read the Valentine
field of that MetroCard

305
00:21:04,220 --> 00:21:11,220
computer in processor inside the
turnstile knows what time it is

306
00:21:11,429 --> 00:21:15,720
treats it as if it's invalid doesn't
even need on those those situations to

307
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:17,549
consult the mainframe

308
00:21:17,549 --> 00:21:21,500
back to our guy who disconnected the
wires

309
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:26,409
saw all these people but by measure
cards for vast sums of money

310
00:21:26,409 --> 00:21:29,940
10-20 dollars

311
00:21:29,940 --> 00:21:35,190
use it once and then discovered it
didn't work

312
00:21:35,190 --> 00:21:39,669
well this stadium the network for too
long either

313
00:21:39,669 --> 00:21:43,669
if you have a couple hundred people
complaining at the same booth with the

314
00:21:43,669 --> 00:21:45,870
richer cards not working

315
00:21:45,870 --> 00:21:50,840
you gonna do some investigation transit
police that some investigation this

316
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:54,840
clerk got his ass in jail

317
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:57,928
so we learned something from

318
00:21:57,929 --> 00:22:03,640
his misfortune we learned that that's
not the way to hack a MetroCard there

319
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:05,929
has to be a better way

320
00:22:05,929 --> 00:22:11,110
well it turns out there aren't better
ways

321
00:22:11,110 --> 00:22:17,570
packing a MetroCard can be done

322
00:22:17,570 --> 00:22:22,408
it can be done in at least two ways that
we know of

323
00:22:22,409 --> 00:22:27,169
one voyage is

324
00:22:27,169 --> 00:22:31,419
duplicated on magnetic recording tape
some sort

325
00:22:31,419 --> 00:22:35,610
the other way is make up a card

326
00:22:35,610 --> 00:22:40,450
on the token with computer or facsimile
thereof

327
00:22:40,450 --> 00:22:43,940
facsimile thereof sir tough to come by
because you need to track

328
00:22:43,940 --> 00:22:50,130
3 reader/writer you have to write to the
one track that we know is written to

329
00:22:50,130 --> 00:22:55,279
but even then you start having problems
because what's going to happen

330
00:22:55,279 --> 00:22:58,570
if you make up a fake serial number

331
00:22:58,570 --> 00:23:02,899
it might be legitimate you're going to
get one use out of it

332
00:23:02,899 --> 00:23:06,039
if you make up a duplicate serial number

333
00:23:06,039 --> 00:23:09,149
it'll work but you'll still only get
when you so

334
00:23:09,149 --> 00:23:13,809
out a bit why suppose it duplicates
another card

335
00:23:13,809 --> 00:23:17,110
that somebody has their pocket

336
00:23:17,110 --> 00:23:21,870
you use it at 10 a.m. in the Bronx

337
00:23:21,870 --> 00:23:25,769
it goes from but say the three dollars
you put on it

338
00:23:25,769 --> 00:23:31,890
to a dollar fifty that information gets
to the mainframe the mainframe says hey

339
00:23:31,890 --> 00:23:33,600
wait a minute

340
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:37,919
I saw this card at nine o'clock

341
00:23:37,919 --> 00:23:44,470
are even better it would say women I saw
this car to 1005 in Brooklyn

342
00:23:44,470 --> 00:23:49,320
in Brooklyn it had 30 bucks on it and I
don't have any record of it going from a

343
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:51,799
dollar fifty to thirty dollars

344
00:23:51,799 --> 00:23:55,600
invalidate this card now the fake car
that you made up that

345
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:59,940
duplicates another one and a legitimate
card

346
00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:04,299
are not gonna match they're both gonna
be turned off

347
00:24:04,299 --> 00:24:08,129
so to speak they're both be declared
invalid

348
00:24:08,130 --> 00:24:11,890
you're out but you don't care you're not
gonna go complain you got one right out

349
00:24:11,890 --> 00:24:13,360
but

350
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:17,769
the other person is gonna go to a point
if this pops up

351
00:24:17,769 --> 00:24:21,980
same station in the Bronx because your
creature of habit

352
00:24:21,980 --> 00:24:26,649
they can start looking for if you're
more ingenious

353
00:24:26,649 --> 00:24:31,370
and you make up cards have different
serial numbers

354
00:24:31,370 --> 00:24:35,690
possibly the same thing will happen
you'll use it for one fair in the

355
00:24:35,690 --> 00:24:38,000
morning one fair in the evening

356
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:41,440
if you use it with any regularity

357
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:46,000
they're still to come looking for and on
top of that

358
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:50,700
it's a lot a bother for a dollar fifty
in the morning in a dollar fifty in the

359
00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:51,850
evening

360
00:24:51,850 --> 00:24:57,779
hackers have better things to do with
their time

361
00:24:57,779 --> 00:25:02,350
as I said earlier you're also not
getting get rich

362
00:25:02,350 --> 00:25:07,690
you can't make up legitimate cards
freighter a hundred dollars

363
00:25:07,690 --> 00:25:10,840
you can't sell the cards you've got

364
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:14,629
all the whole last year early in the
year November there was some guy making

365
00:25:14,630 --> 00:25:17,390
up parts for eighty dollars

366
00:25:17,390 --> 00:25:21,750
sold them to five or six unsuspecting
tourists around Fulton Street lower

367
00:25:21,750 --> 00:25:22,940
Manhattan

368
00:25:22,940 --> 00:25:27,649
for half price what problem that they
have

369
00:25:27,649 --> 00:25:33,140
it worked once it didn't work again

370
00:25:33,140 --> 00:25:36,510
his problem since early five research
reports amid

371
00:25:36,510 --> 00:25:39,549
he was smart he's got a few bucks

372
00:25:39,549 --> 00:25:45,950
he stopped doing it apparently he never
got arrested as far as I know

373
00:25:45,950 --> 00:25:49,350
he avoided the problem if he did

374
00:25:49,350 --> 00:25:52,440
regularly in the same place

375
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:55,789
simulator he'd get arrested

376
00:25:55,789 --> 00:25:59,549
the other problem is I alluded to
earlier is you're not gonna make a

377
00:25:59,549 --> 00:26:02,519
fortune doing this because you simply
can't

378
00:26:02,519 --> 00:26:06,370
the only way you can guarantee that
every card use sold on the street would

379
00:26:06,370 --> 00:26:07,659
work

380
00:26:07,659 --> 00:26:12,549
make one dollar and fifty Cent parts who
in this audience

381
00:26:12,549 --> 00:26:17,399
who in any audience I mean what bunch of
petty criminals what

382
00:26:17,399 --> 00:26:20,669
what punch mafioso side would buy

383
00:26:20,669 --> 00:26:24,389
one dollar and fifty MetroCards

384
00:26:24,389 --> 00:26:28,480
nobody it's not worth it

385
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:32,940
there's too many of them to move to make
any sort of profit

386
00:26:32,940 --> 00:26:36,389
there's no way to crack

387
00:26:36,389 --> 00:26:39,539
I put crack sin quotes by defying

388
00:26:39,539 --> 00:26:42,950
rack as the criminal version

389
00:26:42,950 --> 00:26:46,830
%uh pack there is no way

390
00:26:46,830 --> 00:26:51,620
to crack MetroCard it is a sloppy system

391
00:26:51,620 --> 00:26:55,110
it is a expensive system

392
00:26:55,110 --> 00:26:58,669
but surprisingly it is a good system

393
00:26:58,669 --> 00:27:04,309
sure what it attempts to do

394
00:27:04,309 --> 00:27:08,750
it takes fears of it adjusts for

395
00:27:08,750 --> 00:27:14,350
people who are entitled to ride free for
people who are entitled to ride at half

396
00:27:14,350 --> 00:27:16,519
price

397
00:27:16,519 --> 00:27:20,950
people don't know this but every weekend
for the first year and a half of its

398
00:27:20,950 --> 00:27:23,179
existence

399
00:27:23,179 --> 00:27:29,279
it actually adjusted for people to write
off peak for discount if you rode

400
00:27:29,279 --> 00:27:32,740
on weekends are

401
00:27:32,740 --> 00:27:36,659
once a month the first year that it was
in effect

402
00:27:36,659 --> 00:27:41,230
the dollar 25 fairer it only took a
dollar twenty aw

403
00:27:41,230 --> 00:27:44,230
so we know that this cancer possible on

404
00:27:44,230 --> 00:27:47,260
the purchase and on the end

405
00:27:47,260 --> 00:27:50,299
where r choice a better the sales and

406
00:27:50,299 --> 00:27:53,418
or even better the fair

407
00:27:53,419 --> 00:27:57,659
collection and this cancer possible on
the fair

408
00:27:57,659 --> 00:28:00,830
election and where it hits the
turnstiles

409
00:28:00,830 --> 00:28:05,928
supposedly the transit authority
starting this january is going to give

410
00:28:05,929 --> 00:28:06,950
discounts

411
00:28:06,950 --> 00:28:11,120
at the purchase and in the token booth

412
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:16,110
if you put more than 10 rights record
costume which

413
00:28:16,110 --> 00:28:19,210
a dollar fifty a ride is fifteen dollars
if you put

414
00:28:19,210 --> 00:28:24,490
10 writes on your card somehow your card
will end up with

415
00:28:24,490 --> 00:28:27,580
11 rides on it

416
00:28:27,580 --> 00:28:31,529
how this is going to be done we don't
quite know yet

417
00:28:31,529 --> 00:28:35,010
we presume it's possible however every

418
00:28:35,010 --> 00:28:38,519
method we've come up with to do this

419
00:28:38,519 --> 00:28:43,419
has a small hole in it so we don't know
for sure how this is going to be done

420
00:28:43,419 --> 00:28:49,320
we're going to take the TA at their word
for it for now

421
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:53,549
what else about major cards okay

422
00:28:53,549 --> 00:28:58,620
back to the Bible and that little
reading that we have

423
00:28:58,620 --> 00:29:03,659
this morning one of the interesting
things about mature card

424
00:29:03,659 --> 00:29:08,350
well let let's let's take this from
another approach

425
00:29:08,350 --> 00:29:12,260
the man that runs the organization known
as voters

426
00:29:12,260 --> 00:29:17,289
telecommunications large word believe is
speaking and a half an hour

427
00:29:17,289 --> 00:29:20,669
man by the name should beers after our

428
00:29:20,669 --> 00:29:24,260
said to me after my talk at hope in
ninety four

429
00:29:24,260 --> 00:29:29,240
hey I don't like mature cards because
what's going to happen is the transit

430
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:33,360
authority is going to treat people with
these

431
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:36,600
I looked at him and I said you're crazy

432
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:40,080
you can go to any booth in the subway
system

433
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:44,539
and biometric card you could be out with
your girlfriend riding around in your

434
00:29:44,539 --> 00:29:46,139
car

435
00:29:46,139 --> 00:29:50,260
someplace that you're never on in the
subway like the Bronx like Brooklyn

436
00:29:50,260 --> 00:29:51,830
whatever

437
00:29:51,830 --> 00:29:55,289
for my argument sakes also Brooklyn
because I'm almost never there

438
00:29:55,289 --> 00:29:59,929
are riding around in Brooklyn a member
there on the subway

439
00:29:59,929 --> 00:30:04,269
i buy a MetroCard from there and I use
it to go Birmingham to the Bronx

440
00:30:04,269 --> 00:30:07,759
has the TA gonna trace it back to me

441
00:30:07,759 --> 00:30:11,549
it's a cash transaction it's anonymous

442
00:30:11,549 --> 00:30:14,929
he said mark my words are going to do it

443
00:30:14,929 --> 00:30:19,860
well they're not quite there yet but
they're getting warmer

444
00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:23,970
they can't trace you to a specific
better part in most cases

445
00:30:23,970 --> 00:30:27,779
in a moment we'll talk about those cases
where the camp

446
00:30:27,779 --> 00:30:31,730
however if for some reason

447
00:30:31,730 --> 00:30:35,610
they stop you when you have a MetroCard
in your pocket or your suspect in a

448
00:30:35,610 --> 00:30:38,500
murder or rape a robbery

449
00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:43,380
I hacking White House dot gov whatever

450
00:30:43,380 --> 00:30:46,570
you have a MetroCard

451
00:30:46,570 --> 00:30:51,590
what they can do without a warrant

452
00:30:51,590 --> 00:30:55,990
they really should have won but it would
be easy to do this without a warrant

453
00:30:55,990 --> 00:30:59,210
they could take it any token booth and
say

454
00:30:59,210 --> 00:31:03,700
pay passes through machine have money to
it but before you do that

455
00:31:03,700 --> 00:31:06,919
when the screen comes up with all the
information

456
00:31:06,919 --> 00:31:09,970
tell me the last used date

457
00:31:09,970 --> 00:31:13,100
tell me the last use time

458
00:31:13,100 --> 00:31:18,330
well the last use time comes up on the
screen for the rare a clerk in the booth

459
00:31:18,330 --> 00:31:24,539
in clear it comes out 0 800 hours or
1600 hours

460
00:31:24,539 --> 00:31:27,590
month date year

461
00:31:27,590 --> 00:31:33,600
it's not so easy with last use place it
comes out as either bus or subway

462
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:38,490
then parentheses and then there's four
digits

463
00:31:38,490 --> 00:31:41,720
and it's some sort of code

464
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:45,389
we have yet to crack the code for the
buses

465
00:31:45,389 --> 00:31:50,750
a we have the code for buses going
northbound bus is going southbound

466
00:31:50,750 --> 00:31:54,399
they're not the same on the same boat so
I'm

467
00:31:54,399 --> 00:31:58,389
we do have a partial practice love the
code for

468
00:31:58,389 --> 00:32:05,389
subways we know that if you are writing
the end or the R train you get on

469
00:32:05,549 --> 00:32:11,240
sometime between somewhere rather
between 59th and Lexington

470
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:15,860
and Whitehall Street your card will say
something

471
00:32:15,860 --> 00:32:19,700
between last year's place

472
00:32:19,700 --> 00:32:23,549
subway 15 xx

473
00:32:23,549 --> 00:32:28,220
where xx is urs /url and 15:30

474
00:32:28,220 --> 00:32:33,309
an interesting thing is how many token
booth do you think there are between

475
00:32:33,309 --> 00:32:37,580
Whitehall Street and 59th and Lexington

476
00:32:37,580 --> 00:32:42,330
oh yeah what's a smart people here
you're right 30

477
00:32:42,330 --> 00:32:47,490
so the gets more interesting

478
00:32:47,490 --> 00:32:52,580
that the beginning this year letter was
attached to all employees paychecks

479
00:32:52,580 --> 00:32:56,639
every employee in the transit authority
got this letter

480
00:32:56,639 --> 00:33:01,190
from one Lawrence reuter who those weird
New York might know

481
00:33:01,190 --> 00:33:04,419
is the president to the transit
authority

482
00:33:04,419 --> 00:33:11,250
and it said don't hand out your
MetroCard to your relatives

483
00:33:11,250 --> 00:33:14,940
actually it didn't say that but that was
the gist of it

484
00:33:14,940 --> 00:33:18,950
what had happened is that people who
worked

485
00:33:18,950 --> 00:33:24,630
fixed positions in the transit authority
bike fixed I mean not moving around

486
00:33:24,630 --> 00:33:27,950
what say they were in the token booth
for eight hours let's say they're in a

487
00:33:27,950 --> 00:33:28,450
bus

488
00:33:28,450 --> 00:33:31,750
people taking bus engines apart

489
00:33:31,750 --> 00:33:36,299
what say they were motorman on the train
and this was what say the one in the

490
00:33:36,299 --> 00:33:38,500
nine between the bong some

491
00:33:38,500 --> 00:33:42,210
South Ferry there on the job

492
00:33:42,210 --> 00:33:45,490
she knows her on the job sign in

493
00:33:45,490 --> 00:33:49,240
on wall there on the job they're metro
card is going

494
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:53,350
from the Bronx to Queens back to
Manhattan into Brooklyn

495
00:33:53,350 --> 00:33:56,470
maybe over the bridge on a bus the
Staten Island

496
00:33:56,470 --> 00:34:01,639
back on stand on rapid transit whatever

497
00:34:01,639 --> 00:34:06,100
missiles to keep your employees met your
card which doubles as a photo ID on you

498
00:34:06,100 --> 00:34:07,809
at all times

499
00:34:07,809 --> 00:34:11,168
you're not supposed to let somebody use
it cuz

500
00:34:11,168 --> 00:34:15,500
one of the few perks and I hesitate to
call a perk

501
00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:19,989
of writing it working for the transit
authority is free transportation

502
00:34:19,990 --> 00:34:23,970
the reason I hesitate to call it a perk
is how many times a day can you ride the

503
00:34:23,970 --> 00:34:24,770
subway

504
00:34:24,770 --> 00:34:28,149
really

505
00:34:28,149 --> 00:34:32,879
they wanted out there now out of a job
in Chur

506
00:34:32,879 --> 00:34:37,549
criminal charges were preferred against
the people that went through

507
00:34:37,550 --> 00:34:40,580
how did the TA discover this

508
00:34:40,580 --> 00:34:43,750
well they went to the mainframe

509
00:34:43,750 --> 00:34:48,129
remembered patents that boring thing I
read right after the exciting Bible

510
00:34:48,129 --> 00:34:52,839
reading

511
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:58,650
everything other them last uses stored
on the mainframe

512
00:34:58,650 --> 00:35:02,350
if you have access to the mainframe you
can read

513
00:35:02,350 --> 00:35:05,839
not only last used date in place you can
read

514
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:09,240
ever reviews date in place

515
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:13,680
back to our private lives back to our
FBI agent back to our cop that stock do

516
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:17,160
with the metro card in your pocket

517
00:35:17,160 --> 00:35:23,470
if you get a warrant or if he pressures
the TA or 30 wants to cooperate

518
00:35:23,470 --> 00:35:28,770
he can get a list of where that part has
been in when

519
00:35:28,770 --> 00:35:32,340
if at four twenty in the morning

520
00:35:32,340 --> 00:35:36,450
your boss who's been driving you crazy

521
00:35:36,450 --> 00:35:40,520
who you said if you give me the more
cloture right

522
00:35:40,520 --> 00:35:43,700
I'll kill you winds up dead

523
00:35:43,700 --> 00:35:48,110
at a station where nobody really rides

524
00:35:48,110 --> 00:35:51,330
where a clerk in the booth at night
doesn't remember anybody coming in but

525
00:35:51,330 --> 00:35:52,670
son-of-a-gun

526
00:35:52,670 --> 00:35:56,130
your MetroCard shows I use

527
00:35:56,130 --> 00:35:59,910
place and date maybe 15-20 rights ago

528
00:35:59,910 --> 00:36:03,520
4:30 in the morning a station a
half-block

529
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:07,350
for or your boss is body was found

530
00:36:07,350 --> 00:36:12,490
who you gonna call I suggest a good
lawyer

531
00:36:12,490 --> 00:36:18,210
and the thing is now that sounds like a
legitimate use it now that may be

532
00:36:18,210 --> 00:36:19,020
legitimate

533
00:36:19,020 --> 00:36:22,720
years but remember my friend should be
here

534
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:25,950
what happens when they start saying
things like a

535
00:36:25,950 --> 00:36:30,600
you already 2600 meeting they've already
started that so that's not a good

536
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:33,839
example

537
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:40,200
whatever they start saying if they start
looking at your MetroCard

538
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:44,270
they can put you quote in the vicinity
of

539
00:36:44,270 --> 00:36:48,180
that's why someone I know has started

540
00:36:48,180 --> 00:36:51,379
at 2600 meetings here in New York

541
00:36:51,380 --> 00:36:56,950
free MetroCard exchange if you come up
with a major card with no money on it

542
00:36:56,950 --> 00:37:02,120
they'll give you a different matter hard
with no money on it

543
00:37:02,120 --> 00:37:06,310
this is not yet a police state where
that would be necessary

544
00:37:06,310 --> 00:37:09,720
but it's better to start now and not
needed

545
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:13,270
that the start late when it's needed

546
00:37:13,270 --> 00:37:17,980
I was going to say what else they do
with cards

547
00:37:17,980 --> 00:37:22,400
along this a path

548
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:26,770
the summer you may know if you are
monthly Metro North for loyal Rail Road

549
00:37:26,770 --> 00:37:28,550
commuter

550
00:37:28,550 --> 00:37:32,520
you can get a monthly Metro North or
while railroad

551
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:38,320
paths these are color-coded the flash
into the conductor on the train

552
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:41,330
you pay by check I don't know if they
actually take

553
00:37:41,330 --> 00:37:45,170
checked you pay by check to pay by
credit card

554
00:37:45,170 --> 00:37:49,210
and it's not transferable so in other
words they know who you are

555
00:37:49,210 --> 00:37:53,780
you can give it to someone else okay no
real problem there because they still

556
00:37:53,780 --> 00:37:57,240
actually don't know when you've used it

557
00:37:57,240 --> 00:38:00,400
however for an additional fee

558
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:06,160
you can get one which is also a
MetroCard

559
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:10,149
you can use that you can pass it through
the turnstiles

560
00:38:10,150 --> 00:38:16,480
and they know who you are because it's a
long road ticket as well

561
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:21,480
the transit authority supposedly wants
to start sewing major cards

562
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:26,070
by mail actually they're going to start
sewing major cards by mail

563
00:38:26,070 --> 00:38:30,290
you have to supply aid credit card
number

564
00:38:30,290 --> 00:38:33,900
they mail it back to you

565
00:38:33,900 --> 00:38:38,560
does anyone see a problem here besides
me

566
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:42,680
good

567
00:38:42,680 --> 00:38:46,990
that's going to be it for MetroCards and
I'm gonna take questions in a couple

568
00:38:46,990 --> 00:38:49,320
minutes however

569
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:52,970
I am going to change the subject
somewhat

570
00:38:52,970 --> 00:38:56,620
because I promised couple reporters that
I would

571
00:38:56,620 --> 00:39:01,750
and I didn't tell more on what topic but
it is still the transit authority and

572
00:39:01,750 --> 00:39:03,970
technology

573
00:39:03,970 --> 00:39:09,060
I picture of hands how many people from
New York City

574
00:39:09,060 --> 00:39:14,020
okay how many people remember that
horrible occurrence in late March

575
00:39:14,020 --> 00:39:17,940
when the railroad clerk those are the
guys once again in the token booths

576
00:39:17,940 --> 00:39:19,230
where a clerk

577
00:39:19,230 --> 00:39:24,120
in Long Island City at the Vernon
Jackson station got killed

578
00:39:24,120 --> 00:39:29,080
okay it's possible that this man was
killed

579
00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:32,779
partially through high technology

580
00:39:32,780 --> 00:39:36,750
this is entirely speculation on my part

581
00:39:36,750 --> 00:39:40,670
not reserve accusing the transit
authority for UHV anything

582
00:39:40,670 --> 00:39:46,260
if I thought they deserved accusation I
would be the first to do so

583
00:39:46,260 --> 00:39:49,690
but this is speculation on my part but
it's not

584
00:39:49,690 --> 00:39:53,910
highly unlikely

585
00:39:53,910 --> 00:39:57,009
through the grapevine

586
00:39:57,010 --> 00:40:02,940
the way that this clear-cut killed rarer
clerks response to go out

587
00:40:02,940 --> 00:40:06,990
officially about an hour and a half
before their tour

588
00:40:06,990 --> 00:40:10,120
hands and do what's known as poll

589
00:40:10,120 --> 00:40:13,660
the wheels the wheels are in-house

590
00:40:13,660 --> 00:40:18,700
talk for the turnstiles if you pull the
wheels your opening up

591
00:40:18,700 --> 00:40:24,150
the turnstiles and getting the tokens
album

592
00:40:24,150 --> 00:40:27,890
apparently this clerk went out to pull
the wheels it was the night clerk you

593
00:40:27,890 --> 00:40:28,690
went down like

594
00:40:28,690 --> 00:40:31,900
4:30 in the morning

595
00:40:31,900 --> 00:40:36,730
according to the Greek blind somebody
attempted to either to rob him

596
00:40:36,730 --> 00:40:39,750
or to grab the bucket the tokens

597
00:40:39,750 --> 00:40:43,250
there was a scuffle

598
00:40:43,250 --> 00:40:48,310
its onshore unclear whether the scuffle
continued from the turnstiles and at the

599
00:40:48,310 --> 00:40:51,160
station this happen that's not a big
distance

600
00:40:51,160 --> 00:40:54,839
it's about as far as me to this
photographer and friend to me in other

601
00:40:54,840 --> 00:40:57,150
words a bike felt down now

602
00:40:57,150 --> 00:41:00,520
top my head would hit the fee to this
person

603
00:41:00,520 --> 00:41:05,840
that six-feet five-inches'

604
00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:11,370
in the old days like six months ago or
longer

605
00:41:11,370 --> 00:41:15,990
the door the booth was just a nice
simple regular door

606
00:41:15,990 --> 00:41:20,770
it's somewhat armored not tremendously
if you have an anti-tank weapon getting

607
00:41:20,770 --> 00:41:21,500
into

608
00:41:21,500 --> 00:41:28,500
no problem I won't say how all low in
weaponry have to go to get them

609
00:41:28,590 --> 00:41:34,410
but the door with a nice normal door if
you pull that shot

610
00:41:34,410 --> 00:41:38,069
there was a little latch what you see on

611
00:41:38,070 --> 00:41:43,360
dozen doors and a deadbolt and the door
will be locked in somebody could grab

612
00:41:43,360 --> 00:41:49,150
that door and shake that or all they
wanted and not getting

613
00:41:49,150 --> 00:41:55,270
the transit authority went over from a
simple door like that with america lock

614
00:41:55,270 --> 00:41:59,990
to a nice high-tech door I don't know
what other hotels have this but this is

615
00:41:59,990 --> 00:42:04,090
the same server lock that you find in
the Mirage in Las Vegas

616
00:42:04,090 --> 00:42:08,280
it looks like a relatively normal key

617
00:42:08,280 --> 00:42:12,000
but there are no markings on it there no
hutson varying

618
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:18,740
height and width they all look identical
to electronic lock in some sort

619
00:42:18,740 --> 00:42:22,330
and the floor with this is and I don't
know if this was

620
00:42:22,330 --> 00:42:25,980
a permanent flaw or Justin some

621
00:42:25,980 --> 00:42:30,040
doors they corrected it everywhere or
it's something that could wreak

622
00:42:30,040 --> 00:42:33,470
her because down in the subways

623
00:42:33,470 --> 00:42:36,540
you have diesel work trains going by
one's

624
00:42:36,540 --> 00:42:40,410
twice three times a night def they're
working near you got diesel fumes coming

625
00:42:40,410 --> 00:42:42,569
out all night

626
00:42:42,570 --> 00:42:45,860
you've got more steel dust than you can
imagine

627
00:42:45,860 --> 00:42:49,760
coming of those rails don't get paranoid

628
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:53,820
there and drive still dust exposure

629
00:42:53,820 --> 00:42:58,120
if your they're travelling as a
passenger you there for an hour day 2

630
00:42:58,120 --> 00:42:59,990
hours a day at the most

631
00:42:59,990 --> 00:43:03,040
you go home you blow your nose you take
a shower

632
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:06,560
you probably almost definitely have no
problems

633
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:12,290
but it accumulates on any sort of
machinery

634
00:43:12,290 --> 00:43:16,940
it is possible that there is a problem
with that tore

635
00:43:16,940 --> 00:43:20,240
there have been problems with plenty of
other doors

636
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:25,520
two booths in the transit authority and
the problem is this

637
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:28,830
unlike full nice simple low-tech door

638
00:43:28,830 --> 00:43:32,650
you close it you hold the handle with
your other hand the locket

639
00:43:32,650 --> 00:43:38,420
it's locked because the high-tech door

640
00:43:38,420 --> 00:43:42,440
and if the lock doesn't actuate

641
00:43:42,440 --> 00:43:47,460
you don't have anything to talk while
inside to lock it

642
00:43:47,460 --> 00:43:51,700
to get a lock you have to open it again
in close it again if it doesn't work

643
00:43:51,700 --> 00:43:54,950
yeah after open it again in close it
again and if it doesn't work you gotta

644
00:43:54,950 --> 00:43:59,430
open it again in close it again

645
00:43:59,430 --> 00:44:03,560
okay suppose your small and suppose some
big guy

646
00:44:03,560 --> 00:44:07,840
tries to take your tokens from you at
the turnstiles

647
00:44:07,840 --> 00:44:11,960
you get away you run back to their booth
yeah the high-tech lock on you close the

648
00:44:11,960 --> 00:44:12,420
door

649
00:44:12,420 --> 00:44:17,640
if it doesn't lock you're not about to
open it again

650
00:44:17,640 --> 00:44:22,970
you're holding on for dear life for guys
enough bigger than you

651
00:44:22,970 --> 00:44:28,850
health forced the door open in 10
minutes if he really wants to get in

652
00:44:28,850 --> 00:44:32,370
clerk by the name Robert look bright was
found shot to death

653
00:44:32,370 --> 00:44:39,310
inside his booth he may have been shot
outside his booth and got in

654
00:44:39,310 --> 00:44:42,460
he may have had the door wide open

655
00:44:42,460 --> 00:44:46,930
it's also possible he may have scuffled
with his attacker

656
00:44:46,930 --> 00:44:50,310
ran back into the booth and the booth or

657
00:44:50,310 --> 00:44:53,740
didn't block and it got opened by

658
00:44:53,740 --> 00:44:57,200
the perpetrator then shot him

659
00:44:57,200 --> 00:45:00,570
I'm not accusing the TA because frankly

660
00:45:00,570 --> 00:45:06,590
I don't know I also have to say it's
possible that this was a temporary

661
00:45:06,590 --> 00:45:10,210
problem that was fixed

662
00:45:10,210 --> 00:45:13,760
I'm not going to use the TA I'm just
throwing this out because its transit

663
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:15,230
authority related

664
00:45:15,230 --> 00:45:18,760
and it shows the dangers

665
00:45:18,760 --> 00:45:22,490
of going over to a higher technology

666
00:45:22,490 --> 00:45:28,390
without thinking it through

667
00:45:28,390 --> 00:45:33,200
okay questions from the audience

668
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:36,600
okay I've been asked to take questions
up at the front

669
00:45:36,600 --> 00:45:42,070
so I'll

670
00:45:42,070 --> 00:45:46,109
okay we'll go from left to right
first-person hi

671
00:45:46,109 --> 00:45:49,270
I question you mention the six minutes

672
00:45:49,270 --> 00:45:53,660
every six minutes the turnstile
computers talking to the mainframe

673
00:45:53,660 --> 00:45:54,348
computer

674
00:45:54,349 --> 00:45:58,280
every six minutes we know it's hearts
the next level up

675
00:45:58,280 --> 00:46:04,640
okay okay we don't know if it's directly
to the mainframe we strongly suggested

676
00:46:04,640 --> 00:46:08,009
doesn't upload to the mainframe directly

677
00:46:08,010 --> 00:46:12,410
we strongly suspect that it downloads
from the mainframe directly to the

678
00:46:12,410 --> 00:46:13,250
turnstile

679
00:46:13,250 --> 00:46:17,430
have that on the bus is Hans all buses
yeah that's a good question

680
00:46:17,430 --> 00:46:20,569
how do buses work and know they don't
have

681
00:46:20,570 --> 00:46:27,300
very long invisible cables couple years
ago the transit authority went and got

682
00:46:27,300 --> 00:46:29,220
themselves a number

683
00:46:29,220 --> 00:46:29,819
a

684
00:46:29,819 --> 00:46:34,119
the frequencies on the spectrum that
they didn't have previously

685
00:46:34,119 --> 00:46:39,180
and they assigned its two buses we
couldn't figure out why

686
00:46:39,180 --> 00:46:44,129
as everybody's had the a radio or not
every bus headed mutual radio frequency

687
00:46:44,130 --> 00:46:49,309
but they had enough frequencies for
buses and since then

688
00:46:49,309 --> 00:46:53,029
we the actually know someone who has
listened

689
00:46:53,029 --> 00:46:57,729
it's definitely a data stream it comes
off the bus about once every 10 minutes

690
00:46:57,729 --> 00:47:01,900
and there are occasional other data
streams

691
00:47:01,900 --> 00:47:05,130
floating around we don't know where we
presume it's out of them

692
00:47:05,130 --> 00:47:09,479
Adam J Street tear headquarters for the
buses

693
00:47:09,479 --> 00:47:14,239
so the yeah that's how it's done it's
done over the radio

694
00:47:14,239 --> 00:47:18,779
and it's done move somewhere between six
and ten minutes

695
00:47:18,779 --> 00:47:23,880
thank you next person is there any way
to remotely access the mainframe

696
00:47:23,880 --> 00:47:27,549
I we don't think so there's

697
00:47:27,549 --> 00:47:32,719
3 states that the token booth computer
can be in

698
00:47:32,719 --> 00:47:37,449
a one is for railroad clerks all you can
really do their

699
00:47:37,449 --> 00:47:41,719
is cell MetroCards one is for
supervisors

700
00:47:41,719 --> 00:47:46,259
supervisor console MetroCards and also

701
00:47:46,259 --> 00:47:50,579
I'll look at the all the information
either

702
00:47:50,579 --> 00:47:53,589
peeping stuff for individual clerks back

703
00:47:53,589 --> 00:47:59,190
for a few days he can sign on clerk who
forgot his mentor part because that's

704
00:47:59,190 --> 00:48:00,440
how you get access

705
00:48:00,440 --> 00:48:04,099
to the computer in the booth in other
words

706
00:48:04,099 --> 00:48:08,180
just like to a number security devices
for computers

707
00:48:08,180 --> 00:48:12,169
you have to not only departed but you
have to know your

708
00:48:12,170 --> 00:48:15,640
him in a couple other things and the
third is

709
00:48:15,640 --> 00:48:19,868
the for turnstile maintainers and that's
just

710
00:48:19,869 --> 00:48:23,190
diagnostics on that machine alone
there's

711
00:48:23,190 --> 00:48:27,509
as far as we know and we strongly
suspect because it makes no sense if

712
00:48:27,509 --> 00:48:28,479
they didn't do this

713
00:48:28,479 --> 00:48:32,039
there's no way to access the main free
from the talk with computer

714
00:48:32,039 --> 00:48:36,140
we also strongly suspect that there is
no way to get the mainframe

715
00:48:36,140 --> 00:48:40,569
through the internet that would be
excessively stupid

716
00:48:40,569 --> 00:48:44,219
there might be dialogues but we think

717
00:48:44,219 --> 00:48:47,890
care that they've gone to such expense
to put in I'll

718
00:48:47,890 --> 00:48:52,199
fixed lines and protective lines

719
00:48:52,199 --> 00:48:56,400
it's a fiber optic system
interconnecting booths

720
00:48:56,400 --> 00:49:00,440
a will not boost the turnstile but a

721
00:49:00,440 --> 00:49:03,519
boots within an area to the area
computer

722
00:49:03,519 --> 00:49:06,599
and your computer to the mainframe we
don't think

723
00:49:06,599 --> 00:49:11,119
but they would not splurge and connect
that to wherever

724
00:49:11,119 --> 00:49:14,249
external way want to if they've done

725
00:49:14,249 --> 00:49:18,410
if they have any place external so we
don't think there's any practical way

726
00:49:18,410 --> 00:49:21,749
to get to it next person arm

727
00:49:21,749 --> 00:49:24,779
when the epic passengers wait at the
terminal at the booze

728
00:49:24,779 --> 00:49:27,940
to write anything to the epic pass I

729
00:49:27,940 --> 00:49:31,130
a man who knows some other terminology

730
00:49:31,130 --> 00:49:35,739
epic employees a ploy a picture
identification card

731
00:49:35,739 --> 00:49:39,479
that's the MetroCard for employee use

732
00:49:39,479 --> 00:49:42,749
yes it does we know it's its the

733
00:49:42,749 --> 00:49:47,729
last use placed in last year's time we
don't know what else we don't think

734
00:49:47,729 --> 00:49:48,739
anything else

735
00:49:48,739 --> 00:49:53,009
so could you copy an epic pass as long
as there's as long as it's not during

736
00:49:53,009 --> 00:49:55,059
the hours that person's was to be
working

737
00:49:55,059 --> 00:49:58,339
and then it would check I mean cuz it
wouldnt checked that you would wear you

738
00:49:58,339 --> 00:50:00,180
get often compare the used

739
00:50:00,180 --> 00:50:03,249
Prince the epic pass in the same
terminal without getting out of the

740
00:50:03,249 --> 00:50:03,739
subway

741
00:50:03,739 --> 00:50:07,249
a man with the hacker mentality

742
00:50:07,249 --> 00:50:10,660
yes that would work as far as we know

743
00:50:10,660 --> 00:50:15,819
arm you could copy an employee pass

744
00:50:15,819 --> 00:50:18,979
when the guy goes home goes to bed

745
00:50:18,979 --> 00:50:23,599
you can go and working your messenger
job in pocket all those tokens that they

746
00:50:23,599 --> 00:50:24,140
give you

747
00:50:24,140 --> 00:50:27,549
not you personally but whoever a

748
00:50:27,549 --> 00:50:32,729
yes that could be done now everybody's
thinking okay read balaclava

749
00:50:32,729 --> 00:50:36,400
why don't we copy your past swell

750
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:41,199
once again this gets into the difference
between the definition of hack

751
00:50:41,199 --> 00:50:45,569
and the definition of crack hacker

752
00:50:45,569 --> 00:50:48,849
once knowledge a criminal once

753
00:50:48,849 --> 00:50:52,039
a cracker once the criminally exploited

754
00:50:52,039 --> 00:50:55,489
I am a hacker thats with an H

755
00:50:55,489 --> 00:51:00,359
okay any other questions next person

756
00:51:00,359 --> 00:51:04,279
like to suggest an additional wrinkle in
the logging

757
00:51:04,279 --> 00:51:08,759
problem don't they take time lapse video
the turnstile area

758
00:51:08,759 --> 00:51:14,440
okay at very few stations they do take
time lapse video of the turn solar

759
00:51:14,440 --> 00:51:18,029
less than you probably suspect but they
could match it up

760
00:51:18,029 --> 00:51:22,349
if they had it corrects yeah and if if
something suspicious happens

761
00:51:22,349 --> 00:51:27,739
the PA has the last three or four years
shown an amazing propensity

762
00:51:27,739 --> 00:51:31,029
for ingenious thinking I say that
because I've been with them

763
00:51:31,029 --> 00:51:35,940
god forbid twenty years when I started
it was the totally

764
00:51:35,940 --> 00:51:40,099
the kansian organization okay you would
think that they'd have modern

765
00:51:40,099 --> 00:51:43,690
data processing and stuff on No
paperwork everywhere

766
00:51:43,690 --> 00:51:46,729
paper paper and more paper

767
00:51:46,729 --> 00:51:50,949
the last few years when they've
suspected some sort of problem when

768
00:51:50,949 --> 00:51:55,190
when normal people would have said we
wanted to put a camera there it's a bit

769
00:51:55,190 --> 00:51:59,900
they've actually put a camera there in
tapered shows ingenuity on their part

770
00:51:59,900 --> 00:52:03,719
as their follow-up for cycle next person

771
00:52:03,719 --> 00:52:07,759
next person at 8:45 a.m.

772
00:52:07,759 --> 00:52:11,400
your Grand Central Station the phone
lines from the area

773
00:52:11,400 --> 00:52:16,259
computer computer go down what happened
to the collected data

774
00:52:16,259 --> 00:52:20,849
oh that's a good question if the phone
lines go down what happens the collected

775
00:52:20,849 --> 00:52:23,140
data

776
00:52:23,140 --> 00:52:26,069
the reason it's a good question is
because our minds is something I wanted

777
00:52:26,069 --> 00:52:27,979
the same didn't

778
00:52:27,979 --> 00:52:31,089
if communications is lost either

779
00:52:31,089 --> 00:52:34,529
communications from the turnstile

780
00:52:34,529 --> 00:52:39,789
or communications from the booth
computer

781
00:52:39,789 --> 00:52:44,380
there's really no problem if
communication is lost from the turnstile

782
00:52:44,380 --> 00:52:47,219
turnstile will continue to accept

783
00:52:47,219 --> 00:52:51,549
3 thousand entries let me define entry

784
00:52:51,549 --> 00:52:56,420
an entry is any of the following: the
use of a token

785
00:52:56,420 --> 00:53:01,989
the use of a MetroCard or if it's the
agent operated turnstile the one or the

786
00:53:01,989 --> 00:53:03,819
clerk in the booth buzzes UN

787
00:53:03,819 --> 00:53:06,949
its views to the aged operated turnstile

788
00:53:06,949 --> 00:53:10,749
so you could have if communications are
lost

789
00:53:10,749 --> 00:53:14,690
3,000 people with metal parts going or
you could have three thousand people

790
00:53:14,690 --> 00:53:16,489
with ok it's goin'

791
00:53:16,489 --> 00:53:20,209
or you can have the clerk boats that
turnstile three thousand times or any

792
00:53:20,209 --> 00:53:22,019
combination thereof

793
00:53:22,019 --> 00:53:26,670
if communication is lost from the token
booth computer

794
00:53:26,670 --> 00:53:30,459
the token booth computer is done down
nothing can be done

795
00:53:30,459 --> 00:53:35,599
with that that's why every booth has a
supply of prion coded

796
00:53:35,599 --> 00:53:40,449
cards the clerk with then say if you
wanted to add money to your card I'm

797
00:53:40,449 --> 00:53:42,249
sorry I can't add money

798
00:53:42,249 --> 00:53:47,190
I can sell you a MetroCard if that
happens I i've had people complain

799
00:53:47,190 --> 00:53:52,429
well hey why so I have to walk around
with two MetroCards

800
00:53:52,429 --> 00:53:55,749
give me a break the only gonna walk
around with them until you're at a booth

801
00:53:55,749 --> 00:53:59,969
that's working then you can combine the
two won the 1-meter pardon

802
00:53:59,969 --> 00:54:03,690
throw out your turn back the one that
has 0

803
00:54:03,690 --> 00:54:08,150
so that's not really a problem their
fault

804
00:54:08,150 --> 00:54:12,809
okay just curious but if the MTA want to
send

805
00:54:12,809 --> 00:54:16,839
somebody in a ski mask to the hackers
conference to discourage people

806
00:54:16,839 --> 00:54:21,279
from hacking and cracking the MetroCard
what he had said anything different

807
00:54:21,279 --> 00:54:26,579
you okay the last last thing I heard
with the applause was if they wanted to

808
00:54:26,579 --> 00:54:30,049
up they want to send someone here in a
ski mask to discourage

809
00:54:30,049 --> 00:54:33,650
acting in cracking with that person said
anything different than you

810
00:54:33,650 --> 00:54:36,920
I you know they probably would have been
a lil more impressive they probably

811
00:54:36,920 --> 00:54:39,959
would have worn the uniform shirt

812
00:54:39,959 --> 00:54:44,529
up I'm not going to discourage anybody
if you think any part of this was

813
00:54:44,529 --> 00:54:50,979
ball feel free to disprove be because
that way in three years or four years or

814
00:54:50,979 --> 00:54:52,219
whenever we

815
00:54:52,219 --> 00:54:56,339
hold the next hope it'll make a much
more interesting panel

816
00:54:56,339 --> 00:55:00,499
I'm willing to sit here somebody wants
to demonstrate the

817
00:55:00,499 --> 00:55:04,819
that anything I've said is incorrect
with the three track reader anything

818
00:55:04,819 --> 00:55:06,089
else

819
00:55:06,089 --> 00:55:09,920
I have no problems with that don't let
this discourage you you think

820
00:55:09,920 --> 00:55:13,859
anything I've said is incorrect if you
think I'm actually im

821
00:55:13,859 --> 00:55:17,210
misstating the any of this please

822
00:55:17,210 --> 00:55:22,529
a true hacker would take this man's
advocates and the

823
00:55:22,529 --> 00:55:29,529
and do it for yourself

824
00:55:31,730 --> 00:55:33,030
the joins

825
00:55:33,030 --> 00:55:38,369
okay let's go back to the left I'm just
curious about serial numbers

826
00:55:38,369 --> 00:55:41,520
is there any difference in the beginning
the serial numbers with a transitory

827
00:55:41,520 --> 00:55:45,350
a federal workers or with a normal child
turns

828
00:55:45,350 --> 00:55:49,130
normal cards we're talking about the
serial numbers

829
00:55:49,130 --> 00:55:54,580
arms the well that's a good question
serial numbers are on the matter card

830
00:55:54,580 --> 00:55:59,040
for those of you who have seen a
MetroCard you know that

831
00:55:59,040 --> 00:56:02,920
somebody stole mine only kidding

832
00:56:02,920 --> 00:56:08,820
you know that on the back aside from the

833
00:56:08,820 --> 00:56:12,100
a little graphics and instructions on
how to use this

834
00:56:12,100 --> 00:56:16,770
and the advice to refilling continue to
use the card until the expiration date

835
00:56:16,770 --> 00:56:19,200
and the phone numbers for customer
service

836
00:56:19,200 --> 00:56:24,869
you also have the expiration date it
says here XP on this one it says

837
00:56:24,869 --> 00:56:29,080
05 2798 you have a

838
00:56:29,080 --> 00:56:33,690
batch number on that same line which is
six digits

839
00:56:33,690 --> 00:56:38,859
batch numbers just go consecutively I
don't know what the first batch they

840
00:56:38,859 --> 00:56:39,460
made up

841
00:56:39,460 --> 00:56:43,550
was but if you gotta admit your party
year ago

842
00:56:43,550 --> 00:56:48,260
I would have to say the batch numbers
less than 51 5095

843
00:56:48,260 --> 00:56:52,200
and underneath that there's a 10 digit
serial number

844
00:56:52,200 --> 00:56:55,320
this serial number happens to be 00

845
00:56:55,320 --> 00:56:58,660
407 14 259

846
00:56:58,660 --> 00:57:02,500
I am bite

847
00:57:02,500 --> 00:57:05,580
don't know if there's a difference and
serial numbers

848
00:57:05,580 --> 00:57:09,029
a between types of cards

849
00:57:09,030 --> 00:57:13,500
arm that some very interesting idea

850
00:57:13,500 --> 00:57:17,850
in seeing its cereal if there's some
sort of code that matches serial numbers

851
00:57:17,850 --> 00:57:20,540
with batch numbers or with type of card

852
00:57:20,540 --> 00:57:24,770
that is an avenue I did not consider
next

853
00:57:24,770 --> 00:57:29,400
person up on yesterday when I left the
conference

854
00:57:29,400 --> 00:57:32,580
I went into the subway and a ice like
the car

855
00:57:32,580 --> 00:57:35,569
and this is there's nothing wrong with
it because I've been using it for weeks

856
00:57:35,570 --> 00:57:36,260
and

857
00:57:36,260 --> 00:57:39,260
it wouldn't work after Lee 20 tries I
went up to the

858
00:57:39,260 --> 00:57:43,390
booth and it's like to be a little thing
they have their and it came out fine

859
00:57:43,390 --> 00:57:47,400
and the token booth clerk windup wanna
give them another car

860
00:57:47,400 --> 00:57:50,400
om what happened is or you wanna know

861
00:57:50,400 --> 00:57:53,510
like you want to know what happened

862
00:57:53,510 --> 00:57:59,150
yet okay okay that's a that's a simple
mechanical problem there is probably

863
00:57:59,150 --> 00:58:02,760
dirt dust still those in the turnstile
you were at

864
00:58:02,760 --> 00:58:06,080
its and not like three different times
as before

865
00:58:06,080 --> 00:58:12,000
okay the other possibility is that there
is a minor error on your card

866
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:16,990
which prevented it from being read but
did not prevent enough information from

867
00:58:16,990 --> 00:58:20,670
being gotten off your card so that the
clerk in the booth

868
00:58:20,670 --> 00:58:24,980
could use the token booth computer in
the both to determine the

869
00:58:24,980 --> 00:58:28,260
proper value on the card and give you a
substitute

870
00:58:28,260 --> 00:58:32,190
over okay next person it

871
00:58:32,190 --> 00:58:37,920
one thing you mentioned was that this
system handles single bearers

872
00:58:37,920 --> 00:58:41,570
that's a very interesting statement

873
00:58:41,570 --> 00:58:45,270
given modern aircraft think oh that's a
personal computers

874
00:58:45,270 --> 00:58:49,100
that sort of thing and the only thing
always keep in mind is that

875
00:58:49,100 --> 00:58:53,070
the guys who designed the systems are
somewhat fairly ignorant

876
00:58:53,070 --> 00:58:56,170
so single day

877
00:58:56,170 --> 00:58:59,859
computer with a few things but you let
me interrupt you I don't think I use the

878
00:58:59,859 --> 00:59:00,990
word single bit

879
00:59:00,990 --> 00:59:04,720
once I read all of the pan culture keep
continue please

880
00:59:04,720 --> 00:59:10,850
its if you got three tracks system it's
fairly easy to see a simple

881
00:59:10,850 --> 00:59:14,450
single bit error detection method where
just all three tracks are due

882
00:59:14,450 --> 00:59:17,820
and that's their idea error correction
codes

883
00:59:17,820 --> 00:59:20,970
course a guy like Mike you probably die
laughing but

884
00:59:20,970 --> 00:59:24,980
in its up 8

885
00:59:24,980 --> 00:59:28,859
it leads wanted a whole line and
exploration

886
00:59:28,859 --> 00:59:32,670
one is to try and destroy an entire
track on a card

887
00:59:32,670 --> 00:59:35,840
and see if it still read and then we
correct itself

888
00:59:35,840 --> 00:59:40,250
that's it you know right then and there
that dollars and tells you a lot about

889
00:59:40,250 --> 00:59:42,210
how the date is a format and in what

890
00:59:42,210 --> 00:59:46,839
the approach is a top okay that's
another good question mostly because

891
00:59:46,839 --> 00:59:49,000
their minds is something I wanted the
site

892
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:52,740
first I as an aside the pan

893
00:59:52,740 --> 00:59:55,859
doesn't say anything about single bit it
says Singler

894
00:59:55,859 --> 00:59:59,109
it may or may not be single bed secondly

895
00:59:59,109 --> 01:00:03,730
what happens if you start screwing
around with the magnetic stripe

896
01:00:03,730 --> 01:00:07,410
I've done that I've screwed around with
the magnetic stripe you get all sorts of

897
01:00:07,410 --> 01:00:09,270
interesting things

898
01:00:09,270 --> 01:00:14,920
if you scratch it but not too much it
will sometimes read it perfectly

899
01:00:14,920 --> 01:00:18,859
sometimes it will read a different
serial number on the card

900
01:00:18,859 --> 01:00:22,089
but the card will still be usable

901
01:00:22,089 --> 01:00:26,220
a let me throw a caveat in I'm not a
rich person

902
01:00:26,220 --> 01:00:30,240
so really put very small amounts on the
card but I was able to transfer these

903
01:00:30,240 --> 01:00:33,060
amounts to a different card

904
01:00:33,060 --> 01:00:37,380
a sometimes as I said it which read a
different serial number a different type

905
01:00:37,380 --> 01:00:38,810
of card

906
01:00:38,810 --> 01:00:43,320
I have yet to find a a method of
punching holes are scratching the

907
01:00:43,320 --> 01:00:44,150
magnetic

908
01:00:44,150 --> 01:00:49,839
stripe were with change the amount of
money on the card

909
01:00:49,839 --> 01:00:54,730
a and I we have done worse a destruction
of America strike one

910
01:00:54,730 --> 01:00:58,109
parts that had money on at the moment on
parts that were

911
01:00:58,109 --> 01:01:03,100
blank so I don't know about how much
destruction you have to do

912
01:01:03,100 --> 01:01:08,400
to do that to a card with money

913
01:01:08,400 --> 01:01:12,780
well follow-up well what I was thinking
is that if there's a

914
01:01:12,780 --> 01:01:16,500
if they've done something fairly stupid
like this 3-track

915
01:01:16,500 --> 01:01:19,869
just duping of three tracks look for
single layers

916
01:01:19,869 --> 01:01:23,550
then what that means that you can use
like to track writers

917
01:01:23,550 --> 01:01:26,560
just right to tracks and you

918
01:01:26,560 --> 01:01:30,440
you know you can override their system
in now I mean after

919
01:01:30,440 --> 01:01:33,730
air correction system you own here

920
01:01:33,730 --> 01:01:36,839
ok yeah it might be but the

921
01:01:36,839 --> 01:01:41,230
you know yet to find out why now yeah I
we think that's being written to all

922
01:01:41,230 --> 01:01:42,450
three tracks

923
01:01:42,450 --> 01:01:47,290
because are cards that are heavily used

924
01:01:47,290 --> 01:01:50,759
have from

925
01:01:50,760 --> 01:01:54,200
markings along all three tracks and

926
01:01:54,200 --> 01:01:57,830
they are not identical

927
01:01:57,830 --> 01:02:01,720
that's not necessarily indicative I can
immediately think of ways or that would

928
01:02:01,720 --> 01:02:02,440
happen

929
01:02:02,440 --> 01:02:05,890
and yet yours speculation that all three
tracks are identical

930
01:02:05,890 --> 01:02:10,730
would be true you're right that is
another avenue that we had not given a

931
01:02:10,730 --> 01:02:12,040
lot of thought to

932
01:02:12,040 --> 01:02:15,730
that should certainly be explored I mean
hours and that means we can use our

933
01:02:15,730 --> 01:02:17,480
off-the-shelf technology

934
01:02:17,480 --> 01:02:21,030
not necessary or 9s not necessarily
writerly

935
01:02:21,030 --> 01:02:24,570
possibly possibly next person

936
01:02:24,570 --> 01:02:28,680
%uh I have an observation and two
questions for you

937
01:02:28,680 --> 01:02:31,740
regarding other New York subway with the
bus and subway and

938
01:02:31,740 --> 01:02:34,780
first evolved the boss is away is not a
a debit card

939
01:02:34,780 --> 01:02:38,150
you he wants and twenty seven dollars

940
01:02:38,150 --> 01:02:43,089
is monthly thing however they had a
catastrophic security failure is it

941
01:02:43,089 --> 01:02:46,180
all houses still work on

942
01:02:46,180 --> 01:02:50,369
they work fairly randomly the turnstiles
they work in change

943
01:02:50,369 --> 01:02:53,430
day-to-day basis however are

944
01:02:53,430 --> 01:03:00,430
this up June 1995 card has worked since
June 1995

945
01:03:00,900 --> 01:03:05,750
her

946
01:03:05,750 --> 01:03:10,339
do you have any the ideas and how such a
problem could have

947
01:03:10,339 --> 01:03:13,880
manifest itself and why they haven't
noticed the

948
01:03:13,880 --> 01:03:17,500
there are lots of ideas wise actin
resell

949
01:03:17,500 --> 01:03:21,010
a my first question is has that card

950
01:03:21,010 --> 01:03:26,230
been tampered with or is it BP on a 3-1
think anyone so you either way

951
01:03:26,230 --> 01:03:29,750
the car has not been tampered with it's
not the individual card

952
01:03:29,750 --> 01:03:32,750
its almost any card as matter fact from

953
01:03:32,750 --> 01:03:36,250
from that date from June 95 almost any

954
01:03:36,250 --> 01:03:40,170
expired past at all on this matter fact
will work

955
01:03:40,170 --> 01:03:43,450
at sometime in the future yes

956
01:03:43,450 --> 01:03:46,900
however the period did it works in

957
01:03:46,900 --> 01:03:49,910
is not consistent a its

958
01:03:49,910 --> 01:03:53,450
there seems to be no order to it okay
I'll tell you exactly what my first

959
01:03:53,450 --> 01:03:57,589
thought is my first part is they were
too cute for their own good

960
01:03:57,589 --> 01:04:00,890
in other words they have some sort of
system

961
01:04:00,890 --> 01:04:04,520
in which they said okay on January

962
01:04:04,520 --> 01:04:07,720
first 2001 one

963
01:04:07,720 --> 01:04:12,060
101 we will make every card where the

964
01:04:12,060 --> 01:04:15,200
first digit is three and

965
01:04:15,200 --> 01:04:18,830
whatever it is it is whatever work for
that month

966
01:04:18,830 --> 01:04:22,910
make sure we only sell parts like that
neglecting to re

967
01:04:22,910 --> 01:04:26,680
remember that sometime in the future
this rehearsal

968
01:04:26,680 --> 01:04:30,350
mean I've done it with the years but
whatever

969
01:04:30,350 --> 01:04:33,890
that would take care of love it simply

970
01:04:33,890 --> 01:04:37,109
me throwin turnstile numbers and

971
01:04:37,109 --> 01:04:40,700
time day it may be a simple addition all
tourism

972
01:04:40,700 --> 01:04:45,970
that at first glance when explaining it
it seems like it only happens once

973
01:04:45,970 --> 01:04:50,000
but then they forget that it recurs
every so often

974
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:53,650
that's the first thing I think it may be
a more complex

975
01:04:53,650 --> 01:04:59,109
too simple for their own good thing
along those lines

976
01:04:59,109 --> 01:05:04,380
or they're totally shrewd is possible

977
01:05:04,380 --> 01:05:08,760
or it may be in error within the
turnstiles

978
01:05:08,760 --> 01:05:13,270
in that their turnstiles are not as good
as they should be

979
01:05:13,270 --> 01:05:18,259
partially short out have extraneous
signals going through the circuitry

980
01:05:18,260 --> 01:05:21,440
anything this is such a wide open
problem

981
01:05:21,440 --> 01:05:26,609
it probably had there's his own white
number of causes for this

982
01:05:26,609 --> 01:05:31,660
possibly without more information I've
given you barely more information you

983
01:05:31,660 --> 01:05:33,629
started with friendly

984
01:05:33,630 --> 01:05:36,940
is that

985
01:05:36,940 --> 01:05:40,850
the funny thing is it somebody cards
actually work better than a legitimate

986
01:05:40,850 --> 01:05:44,049
cards the words illegitimate card will
fail

987
01:05:44,050 --> 01:05:47,339
this will work that

988
01:05:47,339 --> 01:05:51,109
that okay the man in the skies

989
01:05:51,109 --> 01:05:55,529
%uh sorry for being so nervous I just
hope questions about the

990
01:05:55,530 --> 01:05:59,440
I'll call from 0 both

991
01:05:59,440 --> 01:06:03,580
during rush hour with are all the couple
people using them into cock

992
01:06:03,580 --> 01:06:06,720
on the buses and subways from the spa
salon through

993
01:06:06,720 --> 01:06:10,290
tunnels arias Horan you

994
01:06:10,290 --> 01:06:13,850
patient also well as every bus as you
said

995
01:06:13,850 --> 01:06:17,279
has to be confirmation saying that its
but soon with his

996
01:06:17,280 --> 01:06:20,450
okay so perhaps give up

997
01:06:20,450 --> 01:06:24,680
some other stuff going on or that means
possible to just

998
01:06:24,680 --> 01:06:27,690
century on the radio thing

999
01:06:27,690 --> 01:06:32,310
of government think that every part is
OK

1000
01:06:32,310 --> 01:06:36,040
and overloading telling each month when
they can't

1001
01:06:36,040 --> 01:06:40,770
right I okay okay look there's a there's
a lot of questions and ideas in their

1002
01:06:40,770 --> 01:06:43,819
slimy handle a couple home

1003
01:06:43,819 --> 01:06:48,230
and the I'm running outta time I'm I'm
over so I'll take a quick wrister the

1004
01:06:48,230 --> 01:06:49,690
last guy after this

1005
01:06:49,690 --> 01:06:54,100
only arm no you can't really

1006
01:06:54,100 --> 01:06:59,430
defeat this by telling the bus is that
every card is OK

1007
01:06:59,430 --> 01:07:04,050
what one works the reason the way that
it works is it just

1008
01:07:04,050 --> 01:07:08,890
gives a list of what cards are bad
because that's much smaller than what

1009
01:07:08,890 --> 01:07:10,440
cards are okay

1010
01:07:10,440 --> 01:07:15,819
and there appears to be no general thing
in saying every part is OK

1011
01:07:15,819 --> 01:07:19,750
I makes no sense because immediately
you're going to get cards even

1012
01:07:19,750 --> 01:07:21,290
manufacture even

1013
01:07:21,290 --> 01:07:24,759
which are no good so you have to make
that known through the turnstiles for

1014
01:07:24,760 --> 01:07:27,490
bus fare boxes

1015
01:07:27,490 --> 01:07:31,230
arm others send it back

1016
01:07:31,230 --> 01:07:35,160
okay okay I can get that a

1017
01:07:35,160 --> 01:07:39,940
radio yeah are you say the buses go
through tunnels and whatever

1018
01:07:39,940 --> 01:07:43,510
they may wait for confirmation signal
they may send

1019
01:07:43,510 --> 01:07:47,150
the same information several times in
other words

1020
01:07:47,150 --> 01:07:51,430
they may send it at noon at 12:10 at
12:20

1021
01:07:51,430 --> 01:07:57,780
and then at 12:10 they sent the new 12-
tender information as well

1022
01:07:57,780 --> 01:08:02,660
which gets repeated at 12:20 until 30 at
of 20 they may send the neutral tone

1023
01:08:02,660 --> 01:08:03,960
information

1024
01:08:03,960 --> 01:08:07,569
what about is enough wistful that happen
which is there no

1025
01:08:07,569 --> 01:08:10,830
bad with for that happening mission with
the package

1026
01:08:10,830 --> 01:08:17,390
band with banquets the eight band with
thank you sorry

1027
01:08:17,390 --> 01:08:21,589
band with iight

1028
01:08:21,589 --> 01:08:26,430
if the information is simple like card
numbers that are no good

1029
01:08:26,430 --> 01:08:30,640
you could probably compress it pretty
well

1030
01:08:30,640 --> 01:08:34,120
arm and that's really all you need to
know

1031
01:08:34,120 --> 01:08:37,910
processing I love how many people got
author's home

1032
01:08:37,910 --> 01:08:43,410
people got off that back in waiting for
the bus gets back to the depot

1033
01:08:43,410 --> 01:08:48,469
a as far as transfers we're pretty sure
transfers are on the cards

1034
01:08:48,469 --> 01:08:52,319
so you don't have to worry about
communicating that to buses

1035
01:08:52,319 --> 01:08:55,460
okay anything else it has to be quick
yeah but

1036
01:08:55,460 --> 01:08:59,299
went to the store all that's a lot of
people getting on you know getting on

1037
01:08:59,299 --> 01:09:03,380
we would have put have a hard time yeah
but who if the card works going on off

1038
01:09:03,380 --> 01:09:05,500
the bus you don't have to report that

1039
01:09:05,500 --> 01:09:09,620
fact you only have to really report
problems and the two directions

1040
01:09:09,620 --> 01:09:12,870
that's a great advantage of this sort of
system

1041
01:09:12,870 --> 01:09:16,939
okay thats all im gonna take or if you
want we can talk later

1042
01:09:16,940 --> 01:09:20,730
I'll last person last question I just
had some

1043
01:09:20,730 --> 01:09:24,640
information for the curious in the crowd
and our company we just did

1044
01:09:24,640 --> 01:09:28,660
a tremendous amount of research into
credit card readers and writers

1045
01:09:28,660 --> 01:09:32,410
and there's a wealth of information
available out on the web

1046
01:09:32,410 --> 01:09:36,108
out all of the different standards a bit
densities on a different tracks and so

1047
01:09:36,109 --> 01:09:37,080
on

1048
01:09:37,080 --> 01:09:40,910
I we did come across readily available
commercial 3-track

1049
01:09:40,910 --> 01:09:44,068
reader writers in the five hundred
dollar range

1050
01:09:44,069 --> 01:09:47,170
%ah and then I just wanted to ask a
question

1051
01:09:47,170 --> 01:09:51,299
the MetroCards serial number that you
just read to us

1052
01:09:51,299 --> 01:09:54,500
I hope that is not a card that you have
used

1053
01:09:54,500 --> 01:09:58,140
because certainly somebody in the
audience who works for the TA will go

1054
01:09:58,140 --> 01:10:01,590
and try to figure out where it was used
in want cameras

1055
01:10:01,590 --> 01:10:06,050
all-rounders turnstiles the the card
serial number that I read is one of the

1056
01:10:06,050 --> 01:10:07,160
cards

1057
01:10:07,160 --> 01:10:10,530
that's in the new york city 2600 meeting

1058
01:10:10,530 --> 01:10:15,480
free MetroCard exchange

1059
01:10:15,480 --> 01:10:19,400
I have no idea where that part has been

1060
01:10:19,400 --> 01:10:23,370
certainly as an employee I have not used
that card because

1061
01:10:23,370 --> 01:10:27,940
one of the few perks employees right
free

1062
01:10:27,940 --> 01:10:30,990
a that's about it I'd like to thank

1063
01:10:30,990 --> 01:10:34,790
absolutely everyone for coming

1064
01:10:34,790 --> 01:10:38,969
pride like to thank everyone for

1065
01:10:38,969 --> 01:10:42,500
I'd like to also thank everyone for
their respect that they gave

1066
01:10:42,500 --> 01:10:47,400
car Bible reading at the start I know
it's not a substitute for

1067
01:10:47,400 --> 01:10:54,400
for church but I'm sure you feel only
here for

1068
01:10:57,120 --> 01:11:01,090
alright folks up stick around we have
another panel on

1069
01:11:01,090 --> 01:11:04,210
dangerous legislation coming right up
next

1070
01:11:04,210 --> 01:11:08,240
so hang out for a little bit will get
that setup for a ride away
