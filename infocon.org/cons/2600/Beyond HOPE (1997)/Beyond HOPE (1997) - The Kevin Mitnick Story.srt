1
00:00:01,630 --> 00:00:03,439
we had some information before

2
00:00:03,439 --> 00:00:08,580
which has since changed I kevin has been
in communication with us

3
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:12,929
and we were going to have him speak

4
00:00:12,929 --> 00:00:17,140
just say how I really can't say anything
you know anything he says will be used

5
00:00:17,140 --> 00:00:18,710
against him in one way or another

6
00:00:18,710 --> 00:00:21,949
are but after talking with his lawyer
talking with him

7
00:00:21,949 --> 00:00:25,570
we we all can reach a conclusion that it
wouldn't be

8
00:00:25,570 --> 00:00:31,800
in his best interest to it actually talk
directly to the conference

9
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:35,329
he did however convey that he wants to
you want to say sorry

10
00:00:35,329 --> 00:00:39,670
that he can't say something directly he
has received all your mail

11
00:00:39,670 --> 00:00:43,629
he would like to be able to reply
however everything he says

12
00:00:43,629 --> 00:00:47,690
is subject to the to be read and to be
misinterpreted in

13
00:00:47,690 --> 00:00:51,320
all kinds of manners by the authorities
I

14
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:54,449
so we do have his lawyer with us

15
00:00:54,449 --> 00:00:58,339
on the line actually I'll let's make
sure we have him online

16
00:00:58,340 --> 00:01:03,910
with us downtrend of are you there well
I'm here but I can't hear you very well

17
00:01:03,910 --> 00:01:07,030
okay well actually it doesn't really
matter because

18
00:01:07,030 --> 00:01:10,270
I'm going to read this press release and
then we'll give you a chance to to make

19
00:01:10,270 --> 00:01:11,070
a statement

20
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:14,930
and will relay some questions from the
audience and

21
00:01:14,930 --> 00:01:18,619
whenever press people are still awake
that may wonder why

22
00:01:18,619 --> 00:01:21,869
get the other side to the story for a
change because I don't think we've ever

23
00:01:21,869 --> 00:01:24,210
actually heard anything other than

24
00:01:24,210 --> 00:01:27,780
what people like john markoff have to
say about kevin Mitnick

25
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:30,939
arm before I begin

26
00:01:30,939 --> 00:01:34,509
I I will be playing this for Kevin over
the phone

27
00:01:34,509 --> 00:01:37,840
sometime this week and the first thing I
would like for him to hear would be a

28
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:44,810
good round of applause for everybody the

29
00:01:44,810 --> 00:01:51,810
the

30
00:01:58,630 --> 00:01:59,500
that it here

31
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:05,060
this is one of the what are the most
incredible cases I think we've ever seen

32
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:08,929
and I'm a real indication of the
sickness out some the people

33
00:02:08,929 --> 00:02:14,030
and charger prosecutions I like to read
this press release then turn it over to

34
00:02:14,030 --> 00:02:15,420
out on round of two

35
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:18,849
to give us a statement and take some
questions

36
00:02:18,849 --> 00:02:22,579
on the United States first Kevin David
mitnick

37
00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:26,500
25 counts for alleged federal computer
and wire fraud violations still pending

38
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:27,170
against him

39
00:02:27,170 --> 00:02:30,190
the criminal prosecution if kevin
Mitnick is approaching its most crucial

40
00:02:30,190 --> 00:02:30,980
our

41
00:02:30,980 --> 00:02:35,319
the trial is anticipated to begin in
January 1990

42
00:02:35,319 --> 00:02:39,329
8 in reaching this point however kevin
has already experienced

43
00:02:39,329 --> 00:02:42,980
years legal battles over alleged
violations of the conditions of his

44
00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:44,149
supervised release

45
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:47,390
and for possession of the rice sailor
access codes

46
00:02:47,390 --> 00:02:51,660
the seemingly on exceptional charges
relating to supervised release

47
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:53,209
violations resulted in months

48
00:02:53,209 --> 00:02:56,870
litigation when the government attempted
to tack on additional allegations for

49
00:02:56,870 --> 00:02:59,370
conduct occurring nearly three years
after

50
00:02:59,370 --> 00:03:04,090
the scheduled expiration of Kevin's term
a supervised release in December 1992

51
00:03:04,090 --> 00:03:07,420
the government claimed the kevin has
become a fugitive prior to the

52
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:08,819
expiration of his term

53
00:03:08,819 --> 00:03:12,920
thereby telling the term I'm sorry
tolling

54
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:16,410
the term and allowing for the inclusion
of additional charges

55
00:03:16,410 --> 00:03:20,400
after months of increasingly bold
assertions concerning kevin's fugitive

56
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:20,989
status

57
00:03:20,989 --> 00:03:24,810
evidentiary hearings were held in which
the government was forced to concede

58
00:03:24,810 --> 00:03:28,419
but its original position in this matter
was unsupported by the facts

59
00:03:28,419 --> 00:03:32,930
in June of this year kevin was sentenced
for certain admitted violations of his

60
00:03:32,930 --> 00:03:34,060
supervised release

61
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:38,150
and for possession upon authorized
access codes the court imposed a

62
00:03:38,150 --> 00:03:41,280
sentence of twenty two months instead of
the thirty two months off by the

63
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:44,970
government since kevin has been in
custody since his arrest in February

64
00:03:44,970 --> 00:03:46,139
1995

65
00:03:46,139 --> 00:03:50,090
this sentence has been satisfied we are
currently preparing a request for

66
00:03:50,090 --> 00:03:51,239
release on bail

67
00:03:51,239 --> 00:03:55,260
during this stage in the proceedings the
government sought to impose restrictions

68
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:57,130
on Kevin's access to computers

69
00:03:57,130 --> 00:04:01,220
which were so severe esta virtually
prohibit him from functioning

70
00:04:01,220 --> 00:04:05,069
altogether in today's society the
proposed restrictions sought to

71
00:04:05,069 --> 00:04:07,670
completely prohibit Kevin from using or
possessing

72
00:04:07,670 --> 00:04:12,040
all computer hardware equipment software
programs and wireless communications

73
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:16,039
equipment after arguments such
restrictions are duly burden kevin's

74
00:04:16,039 --> 00:04:18,548
freedom to associate with the online
computer community

75
00:04:18,548 --> 00:04:21,820
we're not reasonably necessary to ensure
the protection of the public

76
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:25,680
the court modified its restrictions by
allowing for computer access with the

77
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,310
consent the Probation Office

78
00:04:27,310 --> 00:04:30,640
nonetheless the defense believes that
the severe restrictions imposed upon

79
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:33,110
this to midnight unwarranted in this
case

80
00:04:33,110 --> 00:04:36,969
and is there for pursuing an appeal to
the 9th circuit when the strongest

81
00:04:36,969 --> 00:04:40,840
motivating factors for the government in
the prosecution kevin Mitnick is a

82
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:43,909
desire to send a message to other
would-be hackers

83
00:04:43,909 --> 00:04:48,190
the government has hype this prosecution
by exaggerating the value

84
00:04:48,190 --> 00:04:51,750
loss in this case seeking unreasonably
stiff sentences

85
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:54,950
and by painting a portrait of Kevin
which conjures the like this have a

86
00:04:54,950 --> 00:04:56,219
cyber bogeyman

87
00:04:56,219 --> 00:05:00,030
there are a number of objectives
prompting the government's tactics in

88
00:05:00,030 --> 00:05:03,750
this respect first by dramatically
exaggerating the amount of loss

89
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:06,800
at issue in the case the government are
bitterly claims losses

90
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:11,070
exceed some eighty million dollars the
government can seek a longer sentencing

91
00:05:11,070 --> 00:05:13,330
create a high profile image for the
prosecution

92
00:05:13,330 --> 00:05:17,120
second through a long sentence for Kevin
the government hopes to encourage more

93
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:19,800
guilty pleas in future cases against
other hackers

94
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:23,800
for example a prosecutor offering a
moderate Sens in exchange for a guilty

95
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:24,419
plea

96
00:05:24,419 --> 00:05:28,710
would be able to use kevin Mitnick sends
as an example of what could happen

97
00:05:28,710 --> 00:05:32,460
if the accused decides to go to trial
third

98
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:36,190
by striking fear into the heart to the
public of the dangers a computer hackers

99
00:05:36,190 --> 00:05:39,990
the government hopes to divert scrutiny
away from its own game plan regarding

100
00:05:39,990 --> 00:05:40,760
the control

101
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:44,200
regulation of the Internet and other
telecommunication systems

102
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:48,090
the greatest injustice in the
prosecution kevin Mitnick is revealed

103
00:05:48,090 --> 00:05:51,820
when one examines the actual harm to
society or lack thereof

104
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:56,130
which resulted from Kevin's actions to
the extent the kevin is a hacker

105
00:05:56,130 --> 00:05:59,840
he must be considered a purist the
simple truth is that Kevin

106
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:03,500
never sought monetary gain from his
hacking though it could have been

107
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:08,320
proven extremely profitable nor did the
heck with the malicious intent to damage

108
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:10,710
or destroy other people's property

109
00:06:10,710 --> 00:06:14,758
rather Kevin pursued his hacking as a
means to satisfy his intellectual

110
00:06:14,759 --> 00:06:16,680
curiosity and applying

111
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:20,650
yankee ingenuity these attributes are
more frequently promoted

112
00:06:20,650 --> 00:06:24,699
rather than punished by society the
ongoing cases kevin Mitnick is gaining

113
00:06:24,699 --> 00:06:28,139
increased attention as the various
issues and competing interests

114
00:06:28,139 --> 00:06:32,419
are played out in the arena of the
courtroom exactly who kevin Mitnick is

115
00:06:32,419 --> 00:06:35,669
and what he represents however is
ultimately subject to personal

116
00:06:35,669 --> 00:06:39,389
interpretation into the legacy which
will be left by the United States

117
00:06:39,389 --> 00:06:43,470
versus Kevin David mitnick that was
written by downtrend of

118
00:06:43,470 --> 00:06:47,050
joins us on the phone strand of you
there

119
00:06:47,050 --> 00:06:52,440
yes here okay I kept a if you can get
closer to the phone

120
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:55,430
it would be helpful because I can
obviously hear me but I can't hear you

121
00:06:55,430 --> 00:06:55,990
very well

122
00:06:55,990 --> 00:06:59,289
okay I will the phone closer to me is
this

123
00:06:59,289 --> 00:07:02,740
is this any better you're getting better
okay

124
00:07:02,740 --> 00:07:05,750
what they really gonna say a whole lot
from this point I'm going to allow you

125
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:07,440
to make a statement and then

126
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:10,660
well take some questions from the
audience I guess are really does to you

127
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:13,990
is that nobody will be able to hear them
or that I can you hear me in the back

128
00:07:13,990 --> 00:07:16,270
there

129
00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:21,500
I now Eric did you up put up the a
life-sized cardboard cutout I sent you

130
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:22,990
buy the phone their

131
00:07:22,990 --> 00:07:26,569
I'm so I could make that out I that you
that life-sized cardboard cutout of

132
00:07:26,569 --> 00:07:28,660
myself to prop it up there

133
00:07:28,660 --> 00:07:32,470
I a life-size cardboard cutout no I
don't think I have that

134
00:07:32,470 --> 00:07:36,180
well maybe someone from the audience
about 5-10 and dark hair kit sit by the

135
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:37,300
phone

136
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:40,910
and impersonate me so we can

137
00:07:40,910 --> 00:07:44,389
because idk I it's a little difficult to
speak to a group of people from a

138
00:07:44,389 --> 00:07:45,250
telephone

139
00:07:45,250 --> 00:07:49,750
yes I wanna I want to give you all a big
california welcome

140
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:54,120
and there are a couple of restrictions
it unfortunately I have placed on my

141
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:55,389
cell

142
00:07:55,389 --> 00:07:59,440
the first is that because we have
ongoing litigation

143
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:02,879
and a trial next January I

144
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:06,430
I'm hard-pressed to repeal neem

145
00:08:06,430 --> 00:08:10,569
our strategy you're planning or discuss
the ongoing litigation in any great

146
00:08:10,569 --> 00:08:11,780
detail

147
00:08:11,780 --> 00:08:16,270
up I guess I'd like to if there are
members of law enforcement in the

148
00:08:16,270 --> 00:08:17,650
audience

149
00:08:17,650 --> 00:08:21,599
and I spec there are up maybe they could
stand up and identified

150
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:24,650
self to the group

151
00:08:24,650 --> 00:08:28,090
of know if there are any show that
nobody stood up

152
00:08:28,090 --> 00:08:32,140
okay how bout any law enforcement
members that are working undercover

153
00:08:32,140 --> 00:08:36,510
maybe you could stand up in come on a
double shot I stood up and sat down

154
00:08:36,510 --> 00:08:37,679
again with with

155
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:40,709
looks on their faces well at any rate

156
00:08:40,709 --> 00:08:44,219
I I'm gonna take I'm going to assume
that that

157
00:08:44,219 --> 00:08:48,079
that everything I say is on-the-record
and therefore I will be

158
00:08:48,079 --> 00:08:51,380
I will try to be somewhat circumspect
when I need to be

159
00:08:51,380 --> 00:08:56,780
up having said that I know Kevin would
like to

160
00:08:56,780 --> 00:09:01,209
course send his regards but we are as

161
00:09:01,209 --> 00:09:08,209
as document their

162
00:09:22,890 --> 00:09:26,350
at have couple weeks after those
restrictions

163
00:09:26,350 --> 00:09:30,860
polls Waller on appeal have him address
in any way

164
00:09:30,860 --> 00:09:35,569
a conference such this week side would
do it

165
00:09:35,569 --> 00:09:39,540
I hope give him for not traffic

166
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:42,890
on I am Not sure what you the

167
00:09:42,890 --> 00:09:46,230
there are so many issues couldn't
possibly cover them all

168
00:09:46,230 --> 00:09:50,420
inish short period of time and I'm not
certain which one

169
00:09:50,420 --> 00:09:54,130
greatest interest to the group so

170
00:09:54,130 --> 00:09:57,810
perhaps we've already open the floor
with

171
00:09:57,810 --> 00:10:02,670
comments from the doc your

172
00:10:02,670 --> 00:10:06,240
I'd be happy to respond you wanna ask or

173
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:09,280
expand in any area like talk

174
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:13,579
ok and people are when you ask questions
go up to

175
00:10:13,579 --> 00:10:17,949
to that part where the microphone is
being held up into the air

176
00:10:17,949 --> 00:10:20,569
any questions you have for kevin
mitnick's attorney remember a certain

177
00:10:20,569 --> 00:10:21,430
things

178
00:10:21,430 --> 00:10:25,199
regarding strategy that he won't be able
to tell us obviously but

179
00:10:25,199 --> 00:10:29,040
an ER questions concerning what has
already happened I'm sure would be

180
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:33,170
be welcome first question go ahead

181
00:10:33,170 --> 00:10:37,740
but specifically are alleged events that
led to Kevins arrest

182
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:42,010
we we were able to hear that know I
would specific

183
00:10:42,010 --> 00:10:45,439
event well

184
00:10:45,439 --> 00:10:49,420
the there have been a number of books
written about

185
00:10:49,420 --> 00:10:53,469
subject and the

186
00:10:53,470 --> 00:10:57,650
kevin has advised me that

187
00:10:57,650 --> 00:11:02,170
that the fact in this book a I there's a
lot of political I'd

188
00:11:02,170 --> 00:11:05,640
take in order to when he was finally
arrested

189
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:08,670
North Carolina all I can tell you that
it occurred

190
00:11:08,670 --> 00:11:12,719
in February 1995

191
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:16,559
and the Jonathan

192
00:11:16,559 --> 00:11:20,589
that book was probably closer to the
mark the event

193
00:11:20,589 --> 00:11:23,910
which occurred cell

194
00:11:23,910 --> 00:11:28,010
bad make it to make a long story short I
think that that

195
00:11:28,010 --> 00:11:32,089
is probably the one that is anything it
out

196
00:11:32,089 --> 00:11:36,740
immediate now that one probably explains
Hill

197
00:11:36,740 --> 00:11:40,250
most sinqlee

198
00:11:40,250 --> 00:11:45,450
bypass happens

199
00:11:45,450 --> 00:11:50,100
yes experience yes a lot of depression

200
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:56,230
from campers years what kinds of things

201
00:11:56,230 --> 00:12:00,450
make him feel better working with him
well up

202
00:12:00,450 --> 00:12:03,740
I know one thing that would make it feel
better if we are able to

203
00:12:03,740 --> 00:12:09,330
be successful in the bail motion we're
putting together right II

204
00:12:09,330 --> 00:12:13,590
its there is nothing glamorous about
being an inmate and

205
00:12:13,590 --> 00:12:17,110
cast and I I think it does make a
difference whether

206
00:12:17,110 --> 00:12:23,240
federal or state custody it is 400 if a
reason obviously

207
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:26,460
intellectually those we can appreciate

208
00:12:26,460 --> 00:12:29,740
but personally until one has period

209
00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:32,840
I think that hot

210
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:36,690
understand what deprivation right year
and

211
00:12:36,690 --> 00:12:40,390
thing press into a community where your
with me at the behest

212
00:12:40,390 --> 00:12:45,620
a prison guard people

213
00:12:45,620 --> 00:12:48,730
bureaucrats for

214
00:12:48,730 --> 00:12:51,790
you are a number still having said that

215
00:12:51,790 --> 00:12:57,319
lemme cokie Cup first his I've been
representing Kevin flap

216
00:12:57,320 --> 00:13:01,030
hope and a he had

217
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:05,550
difficult straits started to represent
help

218
00:13:05,550 --> 00:13:09,480
brought down there

219
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:14,340
at that point turn trying allow him to
resolve

220
00:13:14,340 --> 00:13:18,910
difficult in a reasonable and what

221
00:13:18,910 --> 00:13:23,130
Kevin at that time but I'll unreasonable

222
00:13:23,130 --> 00:13:26,380
is a sent 10-year price range

223
00:13:26,380 --> 00:13:30,980
for what alleged we both stated that the
entries

224
00:13:30,980 --> 00:13:37,570
and with obviously Press by that
prospect by the fact that

225
00:13:37,570 --> 00:13:41,430
to be their position since then

226
00:13:41,430 --> 00:13:45,590
Kevin that I've got obvious the

227
00:13:45,590 --> 00:13:50,380
young man intellectually

228
00:13:50,380 --> 00:13:53,680
active and but has a good few

229
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:57,860
and if there's one thing say a

230
00:13:57,860 --> 00:14:01,630
I think loud marble throughout the crop

231
00:14:01,630 --> 00:14:05,930
that he had we try to find

232
00:14:05,930 --> 00:14:12,460
those in gotta the fact tried

233
00:14:12,460 --> 00:14:16,960
never lose for example

234
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:21,090
and one other thing help I think keep

235
00:14:21,090 --> 00:14:25,760
here have a communication people on the
outside and he does get a great deal

236
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:32,760
corresponding a from all world and
celibate is insightful

237
00:14:32,810 --> 00:14:38,180
a some with its humorous up for it got a

238
00:14:38,180 --> 00:14:42,230
this year he got a Valentine's Day card
and it's only

239
00:14:42,230 --> 00:14:45,840
line read it a Happy Valentines Day

240
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:49,740
think your cap I didn't want you to miss

241
00:14:49,740 --> 00:14:53,460
Valentine's Day however let's hope they
don't do anything special

242
00:14:53,460 --> 00:14:57,040
14 Metropole and he

243
00:14:57,040 --> 00:15:00,280
be appreciated he got another one from

244
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:04,560
a a woman sent him to

245
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:07,980
on cop

246
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:12,970
ride manuscript she had written a lot

247
00:15:12,970 --> 00:15:16,870
few pictures and get get type

248
00:15:16,870 --> 00:15:20,530
male one might expect when you're

249
00:15:20,530 --> 00:15:25,030
something when you have notoriety and
then

250
00:15:25,030 --> 00:15:28,339
as I think you get the number
well-thought-out letters people

251
00:15:28,340 --> 00:15:29,150
throughout the world

252
00:15:29,150 --> 00:15:32,840
talk about issues be

253
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:39,840
and I think that the fact years fighting

254
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:46,069
or the middle portion like terms freedom
happy

255
00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:49,550
I it help a lot

256
00:15:49,550 --> 00:15:52,670
know that even though the government
make

257
00:15:52,670 --> 00:15:56,850
an example that there are other
intelligent clear-headed

258
00:15:56,850 --> 00:16:00,230
think think people were also

259
00:16:00,230 --> 00:16:06,140
interested in the issue to be played up
not just at this to make this

260
00:16:06,140 --> 00:16:09,470
at team that the government

261
00:16:09,470 --> 00:16:12,790
would have resulted this is the

262
00:16:12,790 --> 00:16:16,060
at best deal they can of RAM which
resulted in his being in prison for how

263
00:16:16,060 --> 00:16:16,530
long

264
00:16:16,530 --> 00:16:21,150
last fall the negotiations broke down

265
00:16:21,150 --> 00:16:24,459
when the government was

266
00:16:24,459 --> 00:16:27,500
there was a

267
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:30,510
their word I don't want to get this
great great detail

268
00:16:30,510 --> 00:16:33,689
fight day that had

269
00:16:33,690 --> 00:16:38,450
estimate taken the the deal when the
negotiations with the level

270
00:16:38,450 --> 00:16:41,540
they were all that it would

271
00:16:41,540 --> 00:16:45,940
could have exposed him to a significant
number appears up

272
00:16:45,940 --> 00:16:50,540
upward to close to ten years and

273
00:16:50,540 --> 00:16:54,220
that was not helping he would we

274
00:16:54,220 --> 00:16:58,700
any still free could have been but there
were no

275
00:16:58,700 --> 00:17:02,180
protection just what at way

276
00:17:02,180 --> 00:17:06,300
that felt he could enter into

277
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:09,688
and it was way too much time when you
consider

278
00:17:09,689 --> 00:17:13,140
a on the issue every start-up

279
00:17:13,140 --> 00:17:16,580
red which is it what we've tried

280
00:17:16,579 --> 00:17:20,178
create anguishing kevin Mitnick between

281
00:17:20,179 --> 00:17:24,650
a someone steel nothing whether the

282
00:17:24,650 --> 00:17:28,420
of the computer from the internet

283
00:17:28,420 --> 00:17:33,100
hack through the internet or breaking to

284
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:36,700
treaty someone stealing something for
game

285
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:39,900
the word attempting to take something up
highest bidder

286
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:43,960
or damage damaged corporation as opposed
to someone

287
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:47,290
who is driven by intellectual curiosity

288
00:17:47,290 --> 00:17:50,300
and what they do is day

289
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:54,379
they look way to discuss try to come up
with three

290
00:17:54,380 --> 00:17:57,790
cell now the fact things take a long
time

291
00:17:57,790 --> 00:18:02,020
%uh last year

292
00:18:02,020 --> 00:18:05,560
longer one would hope particularly when
result

293
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:08,889
favorable recap then you look back

294
00:18:08,890 --> 00:18:12,280
why did I wait try to negotiate all

295
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:15,510
but thats that's what to since October

296
00:18:15,510 --> 00:18:19,310
when I tickle representation just prior
to that time

297
00:18:19,310 --> 00:18:22,740
died had come down we had and accepting

298
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:26,470
in the case I i characterize

299
00:18:26,470 --> 00:18:29,780
minor case North Carolina and he said

300
00:18:29,780 --> 00:18:33,440
supervised release file so they were but
I'd

301
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:36,640
3k to minor and and

302
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:40,240
which K next year since that time

303
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:44,150
all parties including Kevin and I admit

304
00:18:44,150 --> 00:18:47,370
that new and I died all

305
00:18:47,370 --> 00:18:52,040
category it legally characterized
complex case

306
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:55,950
and it takes a long time and Kevin
wanted

307
00:18:55,950 --> 00:19:00,710
turn to be prepared have all the experts

308
00:19:00,710 --> 00:19:03,830
if get expert

309
00:19:03,830 --> 00:19:07,030
and we r where

310
00:19:07,030 --> 00:19:10,470
weird one have proposed dated january 9

311
00:19:10,470 --> 00:19:13,970
yea and we still have cancer that

312
00:19:13,970 --> 00:19:17,450
will be prepared so it takes a long time

313
00:19:17,450 --> 00:19:23,020
complicated with a question

314
00:19:23,020 --> 00:19:27,070
you say it's a to really legally and
technically complicated case can you

315
00:19:27,070 --> 00:19:28,928
speak to

316
00:19:28,929 --> 00:19:32,800
the kind do legal and technical
expertise to bring into the defense is

317
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:34,950
there any kind of general

318
00:19:34,950 --> 00:19:39,720
comments you can make about that without
tipping your hand

319
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:42,920
you want to speak about the legal and
technical aspects of the case that

320
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:46,300
the the technical expertise I mean is
there adequate

321
00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:49,360
technical either adequate technical
experts I mean is there

322
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:52,970
a technical lawyer Desertec

323
00:19:52,970 --> 00:19:56,010
question aspect well

324
00:19:56,010 --> 00:19:59,520
the the answer to that is you watch
lawyer to be familiar

325
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:03,540
with a with what goes on core how to
take

326
00:20:03,540 --> 00:20:07,090
technical information I and project

327
00:20:07,090 --> 00:20:10,500
the court so that they will years stand

328
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:14,160
I when you get really down technical
technical

329
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:17,480
and there will be some in this case when
print print attempt

330
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:20,530
out the amount of law very

331
00:20:20,530 --> 00:20:23,658
corporation with with the government
claims lost

332
00:20:23,659 --> 00:20:27,800
very corporation that will be a battle
of the experts government will bring

333
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:31,200
expert and the defense branded expert

334
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:36,250
tryin valued up but with respect to the
issues in the case

335
00:20:36,250 --> 00:20:39,409
on the legal side it's going to be.

336
00:20:39,409 --> 00:20:43,000
that what law houses

337
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:46,810
mail and wire fraud it in

338
00:20:46,810 --> 00:20:50,210
modern-day computer fraud case that

339
00:20:50,210 --> 00:20:53,500
thats really the cutting edge for this
case

340
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:58,250
terms where the legal expertise

341
00:20:58,250 --> 00:21:03,790
lemme me take a minute throw that out
Cup

342
00:21:03,790 --> 00:21:08,350
the the government recent prosecution

343
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:11,840
when I think talk last 45 years

344
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:15,260
has been using wire fraud yes

345
00:21:15,260 --> 00:21:18,419
%uh to prosecute other

346
00:21:18,419 --> 00:21:22,659
alleged attack and the reason that
they're doing

347
00:21:22,659 --> 00:21:28,010
because their here aside from stature

348
00:21:28,010 --> 00:21:32,020
criminal penalties under the wire fraud
are

349
00:21:32,020 --> 00:21:36,810
or are more step and what get under the
statute

350
00:21:36,810 --> 00:21:39,879
%uh defense attorneys have come back I'm

351
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:43,960
that by saying computer hacking not wire
fraud

352
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:47,000
not a scheme to defraud and

353
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:50,010
aspect distinguished from

354
00:21:50,010 --> 00:21:53,790
your ordinary fraud wire fraud

355
00:21:53,790 --> 00:21:57,379
because there's no attempt for a purist
someone

356
00:21:57,380 --> 00:22:01,580
pure hacker not doing it for his own
personal

357
00:22:01,580 --> 00:22:05,510
not any monetary gain and

358
00:22:05,510 --> 00:22:09,340
as opposed to the

359
00:22:09,340 --> 00:22:13,240
cool rocky someone running kinda

360
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:16,750
an all-purpose

361
00:22:16,750 --> 00:22:20,450
have monetary

362
00:22:20,450 --> 00:22:23,980
in the United States as far as I know
there's only

363
00:22:23,980 --> 00:22:27,540
one district one circuit have a creed

364
00:22:27,540 --> 00:22:31,700
that there should be distinguish between
up

365
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:35,480
someone does a purist that for their own

366
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:39,450
intellectual curiosity purses

367
00:22:39,450 --> 00:22:43,110
someone with the tonight and that is

368
00:22:43,110 --> 00:22:47,220
of that for circuit up doing

369
00:22:47,220 --> 00:22:50,230
by the way which include New York

370
00:22:50,230 --> 00:22:53,419
and there are two cases one just a
quickie

371
00:22:53,419 --> 00:22:56,610
of and then there's another one in the
First Circuit

372
00:22:56,610 --> 00:23:01,540
every here called a which doesn't make
that

373
00:23:01,540 --> 00:23:05,540
different differentiate between those
two situation

374
00:23:05,540 --> 00:23:09,460
however that's not the law of the land
not state spring court

375
00:23:09,460 --> 00:23:12,810
has not articulate

376
00:23:12,810 --> 00:23:16,240
regard and we're out nicer California

377
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:19,520
and their bad night circuit this regard
so

378
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:23,730
but it all predate for circuit been

379
00:23:23,730 --> 00:23:27,950
out so where trying very hard

380
00:23:27,950 --> 00:23:32,250
get our church make same differentiation

381
00:23:32,250 --> 00:23:35,820
because that the case is the no the case

382
00:23:35,820 --> 00:23:39,080
which had which which fax cry out

383
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:43,250
you have the government coming forward
thing eighty million dollars are

384
00:23:43,250 --> 00:23:48,580
up and on the other hand you've got
someone who is

385
00:23:48,580 --> 00:23:53,439
heck Paris well at just for his own
intellectual curiosity

386
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:57,610
sale information allegedly had acted

387
00:23:57,610 --> 00:24:02,240
and did not do it for personal gain in
any way shape

388
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:06,520
that that type issue

389
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:09,520
really what makes wanted features make

390
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:13,908
port government sided where the drawn
the line

391
00:24:13,909 --> 00:24:17,810
San where they're going to by

392
00:24:17,810 --> 00:24:20,889
kevin has has been in prison overturned

393
00:24:20,890 --> 00:24:23,919
here's my family goes to trial crack
three years

394
00:24:23,919 --> 00:24:28,090
yes on do you think that even if he had

395
00:24:28,090 --> 00:24:31,750
been doing this maliciously been making
money Indian

396
00:24:31,750 --> 00:24:35,600
you are real criminal I'll do you think
the government would have reacted

397
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:38,840
this strongly up L

398
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:42,889
questioned by ronica well they

399
00:24:42,890 --> 00:24:46,140
name is Kevin Mitnick and that the

400
00:24:46,140 --> 00:24:48,919
something he had to carry around with
them because they have decided every

401
00:24:48,919 --> 00:24:50,140
once in a while the government

402
00:24:50,140 --> 00:24:53,520
side they pick somebody got

403
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:57,200
may already have a high-profile the
government side make

404
00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:01,820
high-profile and when you're selected
like that

405
00:25:01,820 --> 00:25:06,158
it's not a it's not a wonderful day
because

406
00:25:06,159 --> 00:25:09,960
bring all their power Mike there

407
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:13,530
and one of the things that they do as i
mentioned this case

408
00:25:13,530 --> 00:25:16,740
they hide because they've decided they
want

409
00:25:16,740 --> 00:25:20,700
message out weather with the hair

410
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:23,740
so in order to make an example

411
00:25:23,740 --> 00:25:27,380
you have to make it bigger than life and
then you have to make sure that the

412
00:25:27,380 --> 00:25:28,320
result

413
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:31,620
if you're the government result get is

414
00:25:31,620 --> 00:25:35,540
the result will

415
00:25:35,540 --> 00:25:39,310
caught subsequent impact

416
00:25:39,310 --> 00:25:43,770
future case they want first place that's
why they make

417
00:25:43,770 --> 00:25:47,240
example I think if you were someone else

418
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:50,580
might be a

419
00:25:50,580 --> 00:25:57,580
question from the floor go ahead

420
00:26:00,390 --> 00:26:04,179
three questions maybe the third maybe
doesn't really need an answer

421
00:26:04,179 --> 00:26:08,110
but let's have some fun the summer this
the first thing that struck me

422
00:26:08,110 --> 00:26:12,130
as they talked about taking away kevin
mitnick's right to a computer

423
00:26:12,130 --> 00:26:15,900
is that he is among other things writer
for computer magazine

424
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:20,539
beloved by almost everyone in this fall
and so I'm wondering whether the first

425
00:26:20,539 --> 00:26:21,289
amendment

426
00:26:21,289 --> 00:26:25,210
consequences a talking about a magazine
writer

427
00:26:25,210 --> 00:26:30,690
saying that he can access what is now an
absolute basic tools his trade a

428
00:26:30,690 --> 00:26:31,500
computer

429
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:37,200
and that seems profound apart kevin has

430
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:40,529
as correspondent Department ass

431
00:26:40,529 --> 00:26:45,000
and this be a First Amendment violation
by prohibiting him

432
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:48,450
access to computers which

433
00:26:48,450 --> 00:26:52,990
his would be next well

434
00:26:52,990 --> 00:26:56,490
I first the answer is if you ask me

435
00:26:56,490 --> 00:27:00,029
yesterday yet but I'm not the one to
make the rules

436
00:27:00,029 --> 00:27:06,309
up let me give you take second tell you
is also another aspect

437
00:27:06,309 --> 00:27:10,760
which on Circuit Court

438
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:14,919
when it came down we have sending a
couple weeks ago

439
00:27:14,919 --> 00:27:18,770
in the to provide market damage

440
00:27:18,770 --> 00:27:22,309
and and if and when we get him

441
00:27:22,309 --> 00:27:25,600
not when we get camp attica

442
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:29,520
II then he will have to be on supervised

443
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:34,750
that at a minimum for a period years the
judge had to address the issue

444
00:27:34,750 --> 00:27:38,500
what conditions she was gonna play sign

445
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:42,460
supervised release federal court and
word or

446
00:27:42,460 --> 00:27:46,399
conditions pretty up

447
00:27:46,399 --> 00:27:51,860
court first-team for with her proposed
probation and manages every up that

448
00:27:51,860 --> 00:27:53,230
happen have here

449
00:27:53,230 --> 00:27:58,730
so pick out a couple

450
00:27:58,730 --> 00:28:01,870
financial not possess or use for any
purpose

451
00:28:01,870 --> 00:28:06,270
portable laptop computers trip

452
00:28:06,270 --> 00:28:10,260
any other electronic equipment presently
available

453
00:28:10,260 --> 00:28:14,440
our new technology death becomes
available that can be converted to

454
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:20,059
or has at function computer related
capability think me that pretty much

455
00:28:20,059 --> 00:28:21,090
covers everything

456
00:28:21,090 --> 00:28:28,090
that we have in our everything will be
using in our daily lives ten years

457
00:28:28,990 --> 00:28:34,649
here the defendant shall not access
computers or other forms wireless

458
00:28:34,649 --> 00:28:36,390

00:28:36,390 --> 00:28:40,220
should not act as a consultant to
individuals or groups gauge

460
00:28:40,220 --> 00:28:43,559
in any computer related activity
government

461
00:28:43,559 --> 00:28:46,820
for with their own series a

462
00:28:46,820 --> 00:28:50,970
propose a condition especially

463
00:28:50,970 --> 00:28:55,270
include the fall a

464
00:28:55,270 --> 00:28:58,780
Senate shall not participate in any

seminar class or gushing relating
computer hack

466
00:29:02,179 --> 00:29:06,659
the unauthorized access
telecommunications computers

467
00:29:06,659 --> 00:29:10,070
your computer networks security issues
with respect

any instructions or information relating
to the access programming

470
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:23,090
computers computer networks are telling
just

471
00:29:23,090 --> 00:29:28,210
by when we have when we got these
proposed conditions from the court

472
00:29:28,210 --> 00:29:31,320
we argue that they we thought they were

473
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:34,700
hat over restrict and

474
00:29:34,700 --> 00:29:38,610
in order to comply with really the only
safe place

475
00:29:38,610 --> 00:29:42,350
Mike client with the cabin deep in the
woods

476
00:29:42,350 --> 00:29:48,870
without electricity or running water a
writing his memoirs by candlelight and

477
00:29:48,870 --> 00:29:54,450
we hesitated point out court look what
happened ted kaczynski no sir

478
00:29:54,450 --> 00:29:57,909
so up we

479
00:29:57,909 --> 00:30:02,110
I guess we basically backed off it
basically she's talking about anybody

480
00:30:02,110 --> 00:30:02,990
involved that

481
00:30:02,990 --> 00:30:06,230
if these conditions are put on computer
fraud

482
00:30:06,230 --> 00:30:10,700
calling for someone to live in damage
like exist which

483
00:30:10,700 --> 00:30:14,690
added am but Kevin not

484
00:30:14,690 --> 00:30:17,980
and he wanted to

485
00:30:17,980 --> 00:30:22,090
obviously 1 the other thing supervised
start

486
00:30:22,090 --> 00:30:25,450
written back and being able to make a
living

487
00:30:25,450 --> 00:30:30,539
porch up the court after hearing all
those

488
00:30:30,539 --> 00:30:33,610
art was the

489
00:30:33,610 --> 00:30:38,320
somewhat mindful up the first amendment
problems with the government have terms

490
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:39,270
right

491
00:30:39,270 --> 00:30:45,120
he modified her condition and language
main

492
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:49,350
is the I'm not gonna read all

493
00:30:49,350 --> 00:30:56,350
should not act as a consultant or
advisor to individuals or groups any

494
00:30:56,500 --> 00:30:57,570
computer related

495
00:30:57,570 --> 00:31:02,020
and all the other

496
00:31:02,020 --> 00:31:06,200
restrictions he cannot user yes anything
computer related

497
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:10,200
we get our dark to educate the church

498
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:13,610
aka a laptop for example sitting alone

499
00:31:13,610 --> 00:31:18,330
like like an old Remington typewriter

500
00:31:18,330 --> 00:31:23,049
left connected to the modem you can't
communicate with any

501
00:31:23,049 --> 00:31:26,470
the one is one other thing I think

502
00:31:26,470 --> 00:31:30,770
your station again

503
00:31:30,770 --> 00:31:33,960
as we turn the millennium

504
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:37,879
people are going to have to be educated
what and

505
00:31:37,879 --> 00:31:41,490
not everybody stance Mon and

506
00:31:41,490 --> 00:31:44,639
what the Internet I know many

507
00:31:44,639 --> 00:31:48,450
people pension still

508
00:31:48,450 --> 00:31:51,539
and it

509
00:31:51,539 --> 00:31:55,000
got people in addition great power
making

510
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:58,740
station don't fully appreciate

511
00:31:58,740 --> 00:32:04,020
what has happened time judge in our case

512
00:32:04,020 --> 00:32:08,460
the way she dealt with that she added
one which was very important

513
00:32:08,460 --> 00:32:11,840
by saying cannot anything left

514
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:15,350
previously probation well

515
00:32:15,350 --> 00:32:20,760
that that help that deal with

516
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:25,030
corporate but what if we have probation

517
00:32:25,030 --> 00:32:29,720
I think that that delegation authority
work

518
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:32,889
the judge make the

519
00:32:32,889 --> 00:32:36,789
circle strict I don't wanna anything I

520
00:32:36,789 --> 00:32:40,000
safe I'd be interpreted Chris court

521
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:43,899
but simply because judge came a long way

522
00:32:43,899 --> 00:32:46,919
toward terms the actual

523
00:32:46,919 --> 00:32:50,919
gate Mike not give her give him

524
00:32:50,919 --> 00:32:55,120
shut down by one-third government

525
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:58,169
so government worded first

526
00:32:58,169 --> 00:33:02,419
all cap example

527
00:33:02,419 --> 00:33:05,649
Dec think

528
00:33:05,649 --> 00:33:11,280
judge send out a message

529
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:16,730
okay I freewheeling we have we have a
follow-up question is another question

530
00:33:16,730 --> 00:33:19,870
right okay we hear about it

531
00:33:19,870 --> 00:33:24,490
very harsh sentence being possible what
kind of chilling affect

532
00:33:24,490 --> 00:33:28,289
do you think might happen if the
government succeeded in that

533
00:33:28,289 --> 00:33:31,500
question is China fact when R stands

534
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:36,080
have rest I asked

535
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:40,059
well in order in order to answer that

536
00:33:40,059 --> 00:33:44,549
we have I think you all would know
better than I i

537
00:33:44,549 --> 00:33:47,639
what what's gonna happen technology

538
00:33:47,639 --> 00:33:52,960
x5 here her

539
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:56,590
whether what's going to be available for
hacking Whatcott

540
00:33:56,590 --> 00:34:00,500
attack when are you gonna run afoul a

541
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:04,149
computer fraud that you wire fraud

542
00:34:04,149 --> 00:34:09,500
still out computer hack situation

543
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:12,619
I i think that Kevin

544
00:34:12,619 --> 00:34:16,810
I have chilling cabinet get anywhere
near the type

545
00:34:16,810 --> 00:34:20,500
government call I think it would have

546
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:24,080
dramatic chill chill me just think about

547
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:28,250
and I'm like this

548
00:34:28,250 --> 00:34:32,199
all day in and day out affect

549
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:35,310
try directly with computers

550
00:34:35,310 --> 00:34:38,369
accepted research

551
00:34:38,369 --> 00:34:41,600
up but this someone for example

552
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:44,529
even forget about people

553
00:34:44,530 --> 00:34:48,710
iraq computer hack and picketed

554
00:34:48,710 --> 00:34:53,109
the next some tried research but
overstepped the bounds

555
00:34:53,109 --> 00:34:58,250
baby ninety clear

556
00:34:58,250 --> 00:35:01,630
getting here nation that they have got
beyond

557
00:35:01,630 --> 00:35:08,630
where they should enter getting active
claim it concerns me great we have one

558
00:35:10,750 --> 00:35:11,880
final question go ahead

559
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:14,990
yeah I in response to use

560
00:35:14,990 --> 00:35:18,710
restrictions be placed on cast

561
00:35:18,710 --> 00:35:21,990
there was one regarding correction
session

562
00:35:21,990 --> 00:35:25,370
devices or techniques crips I

563
00:35:25,370 --> 00:35:28,609
now this begins to go into a room with
thought kreimer becomes

564
00:35:28,610 --> 00:35:32,520
illegal for him to come up with new
forms Christian because it could be

565
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:33,240
construed as

566
00:35:33,240 --> 00:35:36,710
technique crips %ah when

567
00:35:36,710 --> 00:35:40,680
the sports ideas are well personal have
these ideas been presented

568
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:44,120
government have what have been judicial

569
00:35:44,120 --> 00:35:48,580
reactions concerns

570
00:35:48,580 --> 00:35:55,580
the restriction

571
00:35:57,079 --> 00:36:00,569
how that has been dress well

572
00:36:00,569 --> 00:36:04,058
encryption is going to come up

573
00:36:04,059 --> 00:36:08,180
and so I'm not gonna feel

574
00:36:08,180 --> 00:36:11,279
addressed any had

575
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:14,890
step fashion other than day that

576
00:36:14,890 --> 00:36:20,500
repose proposals for I guess talk about

577
00:36:20,500 --> 00:36:24,069
key escrow crips Co

578
00:36:24,069 --> 00:36:27,579
or increase act other

579
00:36:27,579 --> 00:36:31,359
read about media or

580
00:36:31,359 --> 00:36:36,339
government access quickly

581
00:36:36,339 --> 00:36:40,470
manner in which are

582
00:36:40,470 --> 00:36:47,470
I'm I would category government
controlling delic

583
00:36:48,220 --> 00:36:51,990
so to the extent that

584
00:36:51,990 --> 00:36:56,440
government earlier

585
00:36:56,440 --> 00:36:59,720
wanna again 123 wide

586
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:03,239
or got

587
00:37:03,239 --> 00:37:08,120
make sample

588
00:37:08,120 --> 00:37:13,210
bad guy way to control

589
00:37:13,210 --> 00:37:16,240
allowed

590
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:21,060
are think now

591
00:37:21,060 --> 00:37:24,250
Richard Park help sir

592
00:37:24,250 --> 00:37:27,390
see more cases like this

593
00:37:27,390 --> 00:37:31,359
happening future as fun as 16

594
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:35,720
well I I think we're gonna see more
cases like this

595
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:40,540
whether or not basic depending upon

596
00:37:40,540 --> 00:37:44,460
I think with started pic

597
00:37:44,460 --> 00:37:51,460
camp their job case the fear factor

598
00:37:53,130 --> 00:37:58,300
term don't let remember what happened

599
00:37:58,300 --> 00:38:02,740
kevin Mitnick like remember the main
people

600
00:38:02,740 --> 00:38:06,890
were accuse perhaps even partly

601
00:38:06,890 --> 00:38:10,060
by the courage

602
00:38:10,060 --> 00:38:13,259
by their attorney at the best deal I can

603
00:38:13,260 --> 00:38:18,020
rather than go to trial in textile judge
added control

604
00:38:18,020 --> 00:38:24,530
arson and because judges all

605
00:38:24,530 --> 00:38:31,530
their sometimes other people getting and
when

606
00:38:31,550 --> 00:38:37,020
sent start coming out four years by
where

607
00:38:37,020 --> 00:38:43,960
there's no allegation and see

608
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:49,360
type monetary gain suddenly become
becomes that nor

609
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:54,010
and before you know it got a situation
where

610
00:38:54,010 --> 00:38:58,290
people are can I differentiate

611
00:38:58,290 --> 00:39:04,160
deep in the night at

612
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:08,089
different computer hacker and everybody
the edge

613
00:39:08,090 --> 00:39:12,220
one point

614
00:39:12,220 --> 00:39:16,250
you think and media ever gonna get the
story right well

615
00:39:16,250 --> 00:39:21,990
its the there are I think that think

616
00:39:21,990 --> 00:39:26,020
quiet in the mythic and

617
00:39:26,020 --> 00:39:29,340
partially because we've had our are our
own

618
00:39:29,340 --> 00:39:33,050
attention or minor

619
