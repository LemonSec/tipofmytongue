00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:23,680
eyes investigating groups like Hamas and
all kinds of

9
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:27,880
other interesting investigation so that
a further do you like to welcome

10
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:34,879
privatize TVA the

11

could you kill a slide projector so I
don't go blind

12
00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:41,570
that blue light

13
00:00:41,570 --> 00:00:45,120
right in my eyes thank you

14

do that anyway or apologize to all the
people who thought they won the

16
00:00:53,590 --> 00:00:57,420
spot the Fed contest as ours walking
around

17
00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:02,140
all the people who started hiring
floppies and lowering their voices

18
00:01:02,140 --> 00:01:07,920
power known I woulda won the suit I know
that the

19
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:11,940
public image show public law enforcement

20
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:16,240
private law enforcement is that they
rather be boiled in oil

21
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:20,000
take a guest speaker slot at a
convention like this

22
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,220
it's just simply not true

23
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:26,890
one other things are going to be talking
about today as hell

24
00:01:26,890 --> 00:01:32,950
most investigators share very important
common goal with most hackers

25
00:01:32,950 --> 00:01:38,070
as opposed the crackers all the other
variations thereof

26
00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:43,259
and that goal is the free and open
access to information the

27
00:01:43,259 --> 00:01:49,130
the democratization up information wanna
shot up

28
00:01:49,130 --> 00:01:56,130
packed their the

29
00:01:58,780 --> 00:02:00,150
politeness is not a

30
00:02:00,150 --> 00:02:06,500
job requirement my job a manual spoke
about a

31
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:09,630
a case that we completed about six
months ago

32
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:13,400
which made it into the the mass media no

33
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:17,460
was a hunt for nazi war criminals in
Canada

34
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:23,270
with very little trouble we found a 161

35
00:02:23,270 --> 00:02:27,340
war criminals in Canada and I have to
tell you

36
00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:32,230
the

37
00:02:32,230 --> 00:02:37,820
I have to tell you it was knots as a
result of my great investigative ability

38
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:38,299
although

39
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:44,810
there is a I it was because that things
have changed in the past 10 years

40
00:02:44,810 --> 00:02:49,220
information is more open information is
more accessible

41
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:56,220
and it's more publicly accessible a
third of the people that we found

42
00:02:56,420 --> 00:03:00,400
we found by picking up a copy of the
Canada pro phone and plugging their

43
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:00,900
names

44
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:06,100
they were in the phone book another
third we found

45
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:10,430
or even more than another third by
pulling driver license records motor

46
00:03:10,430 --> 00:03:13,010
vehicle records property registration

47
00:03:13,010 --> 00:03:19,470
all of which is now online maybe ten
percent of the people we found we had

48
00:03:19,470 --> 00:03:20,170
them out there

49
00:03:20,170 --> 00:03:23,420
real honest to goodness investigation
defines

50
00:03:23,420 --> 00:03:28,160
that's sort of accessibility

51
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:32,660
to information on the part of the
average private person and I am a

52
00:03:32,660 --> 00:03:34,250
private investigator

53
00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:37,560
I have no more rights to access
information than you do

54
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:41,010
i cant going to see i well I can go into
NCIC

55
00:03:41,010 --> 00:03:45,609
not suppose I'll I can't go into seic

56
00:03:45,610 --> 00:03:49,120
I can't get all records although

57
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:53,280
about five people have offered meet all
records here today I

58
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:57,880
all of the information that I can access

59
00:03:57,880 --> 00:04:03,200
you can access and this has enormously
empower the average purse

60
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:06,310
fifteen years ago

61
00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:10,790
when the Jewish community and the
community of people who care in Canada

62
00:04:10,790 --> 00:04:14,760
want to the government after the showing
Commission assert

63
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:19,049
how many war criminals are either in
Canada who are they where are they the

64
00:04:19,048 --> 00:04:19,700
government said

65
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:23,229
we can tell you it's closed files with
dole or we've got everything under

66
00:04:23,230 --> 00:04:24,090
control

67
00:04:24,090 --> 00:04:30,400
now as an aside let me tell you since
1979 the US is the porter

68
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:35,850
or chased out over a hundred war
criminals Canada supported want which is

69
00:04:35,850 --> 00:04:36,460
why

70
00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:39,989
we joined with the number public
interest organizations

71
00:04:39,990 --> 00:04:46,260
and mounted the investigation in Canada
fifteen years ago the citizens of Canada

72
00:04:46,260 --> 00:04:48,430
had to take the government's word

73
00:04:48,430 --> 00:04:51,650
for who was in Canada and what was
available

74
00:04:51,650 --> 00:04:55,510
last year they didn't

75
00:04:55,510 --> 00:05:00,190
because we had the ability to go out and
pull records and investigate people

76
00:05:00,190 --> 00:05:07,190
and knock on their doors and talk to the

77
00:05:07,310 --> 00:05:11,000
revolution in the power of computing

78
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:15,100
and the power database management and
just simply

79
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:18,390
what is now computer accessible as a
poster

80
00:05:18,390 --> 00:05:22,280
what fifteen years ago was only on
microfiche or only on

81
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:25,610
index cards has changed the world

82
00:05:25,610 --> 00:05:28,960
and I'm not talking about that you can
now

83
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:33,570
take a picture yourself morning the
camera put it on the internet i'm

84
00:05:33,570 --> 00:05:34,599
talking about.

85
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:40,539
driver license records motor vehicle
records voter registration almost

86
00:05:40,539 --> 00:05:44,830
every newspapers now accessible through

87
00:05:44,830 --> 00:05:48,070
dial-up services or through the net for
free

88
00:05:48,070 --> 00:05:52,450
and and the ability to access

89
00:05:52,450 --> 00:05:59,120
I one-shot the work of hundreds and
hundreds and hundreds of investigative

90
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:00,100
reporters and

91
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:05,610
unbelievably powerful tool you can

92
00:06:05,610 --> 00:06:09,810
now protect yourself and increase the
amount of Justice

93
00:06:09,810 --> 00:06:14,280
in your life without having to rely on
the government

94
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:17,450
you can find out if you're nanny

95
00:06:17,450 --> 00:06:21,479
your nanny that you're planning to hire
has a criminal record

96
00:06:21,479 --> 00:06:26,039
or is it wrong or as a drug use you can

97
00:06:26,039 --> 00:06:29,090
investigated employees before you hire

98
00:06:29,090 --> 00:06:32,910
UK find your missing father

99
00:06:32,910 --> 00:06:36,120
you can hun nazi war criminals

100
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:39,690
you can increase the amount a justice in
the world

101
00:06:39,690 --> 00:06:44,660
and unfortunately not in my opinion

102
00:06:44,660 --> 00:06:48,380
but in the opinion of many governments
in many large corporations

103
00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:55,320
that's not a good for for hundreds if
not thousands of years

104
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:59,450
there has been an information of and
information really is

105
00:06:59,450 --> 00:07:05,789
power as you guys know probably better
than me as an example let's talk about

106
00:07:05,790 --> 00:07:07,930
equifax

107
00:07:07,930 --> 00:07:12,360
Equifax is one of the big three credit
reporting companies

108
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:15,530
they have a file on every single
American

109
00:07:15,530 --> 00:07:22,530
who has ever applied for credit bought a
house or sneezed in a dark room

110
00:07:22,650 --> 00:07:25,870
few years ago they were planning to sell
it

111
00:07:25,870 --> 00:07:29,960
on it this something called marketplace
there's a big offer or

112
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:33,110
they cancel their plans to do that

113
00:07:33,110 --> 00:07:36,320
the following year in a public relations
campaign

114
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:39,810
they announced that they were cutting of
private investigators from access to

115
00:07:39,810 --> 00:07:42,090
Equifax

116
00:07:42,090 --> 00:07:45,699
what a scam the fact of the matter is

117
00:07:45,699 --> 00:07:49,460
equifax in addition to being the largest
private investor a

118
00:07:49,460 --> 00:07:54,760
credit reporting agency in the United
States after TRW and

119
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:58,340
and before TransUnion it is the

120
00:07:58,340 --> 00:08:02,120
largest private investigative agency in
the United States

121
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:06,990
employing more than 30,000 full-time and
part-time investigators

122
00:08:06,990 --> 00:08:10,030
who do insurance investigations
background investigations and

123
00:08:10,030 --> 00:08:11,690
pre-employment checks

124
00:08:11,690 --> 00:08:15,530
the truth is what they were doing is
we're saying if you want to access our

125
00:08:15,530 --> 00:08:18,490
flaws in our investigative consumer
reports

126
00:08:18,490 --> 00:08:22,530
what are these independent private
investigators give us your money

127
00:08:22,530 --> 00:08:25,710
that's the truth what hap

128
00:08:25,710 --> 00:08:30,280
equifax once you have to go to Equifax
and pay big money

129
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:33,579
they don't want you to be able to spend
five dollars

130
00:08:33,579 --> 00:08:37,669
an axis somebody's driving license
record to see if there really are

131
00:08:37,669 --> 00:08:42,770
they are to see if their pre employment
application is legit

132
00:08:42,770 --> 00:08:45,920
to see if you should hire them as a
nanny

133
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:49,689
they want you to pay equifax a hundred
and fifty dollars for pre-employment

134
00:08:49,690 --> 00:08:51,010
Screening Report

135
00:08:51,010 --> 00:08:57,520
which is what they charge

136
00:08:57,520 --> 00:09:01,199
unfortunately access to information

137
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:04,360
and the ability to catalog things and
cross-reference use

138
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:10,820
has frightened a lot of people and there
is enormous potential

139
00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:14,400
for abuse when you start putting
something into a computer

140
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:19,829
in a book that I read one time fella
wrote the first law of computer

141
00:09:19,830 --> 00:09:20,960
databases

142
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:24,590
is that the database will be used for
something that wasn't intended

143
00:09:24,590 --> 00:09:31,470
and that's absolutely true I think
however that there's been

144
00:09:31,470 --> 00:09:34,650
extraordinarily unnecessary

145
00:09:34,650 --> 00:09:39,220
turn in the wrong direction towards
access the database

146
00:09:39,220 --> 00:09:42,650
it is true

147
00:09:42,650 --> 00:09:46,100
and I'm sure will discuss the store
questions and answers which is gonna

148
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:50,610
start about one minute it is true

149
00:09:50,610 --> 00:09:55,310
that I can go online and reliably
determine if you're homosexual or less

150
00:09:55,310 --> 00:10:02,310
it is true that I can go online and
conclusively determine your religion it

151
00:10:02,970 --> 00:10:04,800
is true that I can determine

152
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:08,580
without breaking a sweat or getting

153
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:14,130
political carpal tunnel syndrome I can
determine how much money you make

154
00:10:14,130 --> 00:10:17,670
what books you read whatcha political
affiliations or

155
00:10:17,670 --> 00:10:22,540
who you talk to where you go on vacation

156
00:10:22,540 --> 00:10:26,060
the list goes on and on and on almost
everything

157
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:29,440
in many cases what you buy at the
supermarket

158
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:32,780
what movies you read the blockbuster

159
00:10:32,780 --> 00:10:35,980
its all their online and it's for sale

160
00:10:35,980 --> 00:10:40,170
it's true that after the

161
00:10:40,170 --> 00:10:43,329
clarence thomas answer you can't go

162
00:10:43,330 --> 00:10:48,020
into blockbuster find out if someone
writes a

163
00:10:48,020 --> 00:10:53,530
long dong silver movie but you can't buy

164
00:10:53,530 --> 00:10:58,220
the marketing list and the mailing list
that blockbuster sales in there are 10

165
00:10:58,220 --> 00:10:58,590
the

166
00:10:58,590 --> 00:11:01,710
the big sellers are used to wear one of
those

167
00:11:01,710 --> 00:11:08,440
guy sitting here with the nose and
glasses I once came to 2600 meeting

168
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:09,630
where in one of those

169
00:11:09,630 --> 00:11:13,390
it is true

170
00:11:13,390 --> 00:11:19,360
that all of the major gay magazines sell
their mailing lists anyone who cares to

171
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:19,890
bother

172
00:11:19,890 --> 00:11:26,890
it is true that remarkable and
frightening computer programs have been

173
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:28,569
written

174
00:11:28,570 --> 00:11:32,530
home which correlate information

175
00:11:32,530 --> 00:11:36,630
at all give your ridiculous example I'm
not sure it's a legitimate

176
00:11:36,630 --> 00:11:40,689
one that people who own cats in
Volkswagen's

177
00:11:40,690 --> 00:11:45,400
like rated she moves I mean it is
remarkable

178
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:48,400
what by feeding data about someone

179
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:52,490
into the database system you can
extrapolate out

180
00:11:52,490 --> 00:11:57,800
there is huge potential for abuse that's
true

181
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:01,550
but it's my belief I suspect that's the
belief for most of the people in this

182
00:12:01,550 --> 00:12:02,120
room

183
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:06,300
that this far more positive affect to be
gained by keeping

184
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:09,860
every database open except for certain
obvious ones

185
00:12:09,860 --> 00:12:13,720
then by closing every database I have to
tell you

186
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:19,040
bluntly closing databases will not
affect me I will continue to get

187
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:19,579
attorney

188
00:12:19,580 --> 00:12:24,420
ever just about any database i wont and
I'm sure so almost to the people in this

189
00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:24,860
room

190
00:12:24,860 --> 00:12:28,040
all that it will do

191
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:34,170
is that it will harm the ability of the
average person to control

192
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:38,300
and affect their own lives and to get
the information that they need

193
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:42,400
to check up on government see if
governments lying to them the check up

194
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:44,910
on big businesses see a big businesses
like

195
00:12:44,910 --> 00:12:51,910
to check out the guy next door and find
out if he's an axe murder

196
00:12:52,250 --> 00:12:55,630
closing information is bad keeping
information

197
00:12:55,630 --> 00:12:58,980
open is good questions and answers now

198
00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:05,150
anyone by the way but also the director
also a microphone next to the

199
00:13:05,150 --> 00:13:10,079
a the sound the the harassed sound man
this point

200
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:17,080
where the guy in the and the sunglasses
point

201
00:13:22,420 --> 00:13:25,970
so what's the best way chess the best
way to

202
00:13:25,970 --> 00:13:32,839
hide your identity

203
00:13:32,839 --> 00:13:38,880
first let me get a good look at church
okay no outside you can't

204
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:45,060
unless you want to establish a
fraudulent under

205
00:13:45,060 --> 00:13:49,459
you must have a social security number
you must have a driver's license you

206
00:13:49,459 --> 00:13:50,959
must register your vehicle

207
00:13:50,959 --> 00:13:56,050
you must open a bank account which
requires all of those documents and more

208
00:13:56,050 --> 00:14:00,730
if you wanna pass for in theory you have
to give your real name

209
00:14:00,730 --> 00:14:04,420
you have to pay taxes or you're supposed
to pay taxes

210
00:14:04,420 --> 00:14:10,899
and so on and so forth for 99.99 up to
ten digits

211
00:14:10,899 --> 00:14:14,790
percent of the population it is not a
feasible solution

212
00:14:14,790 --> 00:14:21,240
for the other point zero zero zero one
percent I'll tell you how you do that

213
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:25,750
second if you're so in need of doing it
or so

214
00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:32,300
fanatically parent I will tell you that
there is an intermediate step

215
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:38,550
if you feel that people know too much
about sure we'll know too much about you

216
00:14:38,550 --> 00:14:42,700
there is an intermediate step you can
take short of changing your identity and

217
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:43,540
becoming

218
00:14:43,540 --> 00:14:47,849
so they were the guy hunting for the one
arm man

219
00:14:47,850 --> 00:14:52,270
the future short of becoming the
fugitive there are things that you can

220
00:14:52,270 --> 00:14:53,319
intelligently do

221
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:56,350
don't use credit cards pay cash

222
00:14:56,350 --> 00:15:00,779
probably good for your bank account to
do that also dole

223
00:15:00,779 --> 00:15:04,300
answer survey cards they are a scam

224
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:08,390
every time you get one of those little
carts when you buy our products or

225
00:15:08,390 --> 00:15:10,250
services that your warranty

226
00:15:10,250 --> 00:15:14,089
you have a warranty anyway I promise you
what happens is

227
00:15:14,089 --> 00:15:18,420
that goes on a mailing list they don't
need to ask you how many children live

228
00:15:18,420 --> 00:15:19,250
in the house

229
00:15:19,250 --> 00:15:23,380
and what your annual income is to give
you your warranty on your seagate hard

230
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:24,029
rock

231
00:15:24,029 --> 00:15:27,970
but they do need that so they can put
you in a database and market to you

232
00:15:27,970 --> 00:15:32,820
that's all that data based other people
subscribe to magazines

233
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:37,120
using a phony baloney I can find out

234
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:40,149
so much about you by finding out what
you re

235
00:15:40,149 --> 00:15:43,720
if you subscribe to soldier of fortune
magazine

236
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:48,540
you're probably a different type of
person that if you subscribe to Harper's

237
00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:54,400
Magazine if you join the NRA you're
probably a different type of person that

238
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:56,110
if you join Greenpeace

239
00:15:56,110 --> 00:16:00,589
I am I have to belong to both serious

240
00:16:00,589 --> 00:16:06,660
I am because I want to be able to shoot
the people who hunt the wells

241
00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:13,660
the

242
00:16:15,150 --> 00:16:22,130
there are two other throwaway lines such
a loser basically

243
00:16:22,130 --> 00:16:26,500
don't give information that you don't
absolutely have to

244
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:29,500
by law in the key is

245
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:33,800
by law if they ask you for your social
security number unless you're applying

246
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:34,660
for credit

247
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:38,219
or applying for a position with the
secret service which nobody in this room

248
00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:39,120
again anyway

249
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:42,540
I am don't give your social security
number

250
00:16:42,540 --> 00:16:46,170
if they ask for your driver's license
number on your check

251
00:16:46,170 --> 00:16:53,170
that is against the law in most states
dole given do take advantage of all the

252
00:16:53,370 --> 00:16:55,230
opportunities to protect your privacy

253
00:16:55,230 --> 00:16:58,790
boa it's really interesting if you
subscribe to each magazine with a

254
00:16:58,790 --> 00:16:59,760
different name

255
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:03,830
because you can follow they sell your
name to its its

256
00:17:03,830 --> 00:17:07,970
kinda cool I am now

257
00:17:07,970 --> 00:17:12,089
for the people who wont to

258
00:17:12,089 --> 00:17:15,810
spend huge amounts of money I

259
00:17:15,810 --> 00:17:19,159
and really hide their identity

260
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:24,220
probably commit about seven or eight
felonies in the process there's a very

261
00:17:24,220 --> 00:17:25,050
easy way to do it

262
00:17:25,050 --> 00:17:30,000
find somebody who's there I for social
security number

263
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:35,010
they will give it to you without
checking its amazing going get a

264
00:17:35,010 --> 00:17:36,230
driver's license

265
00:17:36,230 --> 00:17:39,320
take that social security number on the
driver's license

266
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:44,270
get a pass for the easier way this fight
someone who died overseas

267
00:17:44,270 --> 00:17:48,900
so there's no death record and by the
way Nexus is good for that check for

268
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:52,750
deaths overseas or big accidents things
like the

269
00:17:52,750 --> 00:17:57,530
taken their social security number their
date of birth

270
00:17:57,530 --> 00:18:02,750
so on and so forth right to the state so
you lost your driver's license renewed

271
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:05,820
duplicative going on take a duplicate

272
00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:09,310
make sure you do in the state that
doesn't take your thumb print or at

273
00:18:09,310 --> 00:18:12,870
least didn't take their thumbprint
because you will go to jail

274
00:18:12,870 --> 00:18:17,670
a open a mail drop before you have the
license mail to you don't have it sent

275
00:18:17,670 --> 00:18:18,570
your real

276
00:18:18,570 --> 00:18:21,580
a kinda obvious us

277
00:18:21,580 --> 00:18:25,699
a then don't apply for a passport you
will get one

278
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:30,690
I am it'll take about five or six years

279
00:18:30,690 --> 00:18:34,200
if it all before you get caught and in
that time

280
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:39,960
you can probably go to the Dominican
Republic for argentina or or

281
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:43,760
liberia's very good for the sort of
things I years are good for the sort of

282
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:44,129
thing

283
00:18:44,130 --> 00:18:48,290
you open a bank account a certain amount
of money and they will give you a pass

284
00:18:48,290 --> 00:18:48,820
for

285
00:18:48,820 --> 00:18:52,000
about 15 different countries the

286
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,570
passports are for the ask I

287
00:18:55,570 --> 00:18:59,919
you have to really throw away an
enormous amount of money

288
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:04,530
put yourselves at the mercy of people
with phones through their noses

289
00:19:04,530 --> 00:19:05,399
basically

290
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:08,790
and it's really

291
00:19:08,790 --> 00:19:14,340
a lotta trouble I've done it a few times
when we did the thing in Canada I gotta

292
00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:18,010
a passport driver's license and so on
and so forth under the name is Sal

293
00:19:18,010 --> 00:19:18,790
Romano

294
00:19:18,790 --> 00:19:23,310
and that identified we establish the
university and

295
00:19:23,310 --> 00:19:26,450
in believes because police lets you do
things like the

296
00:19:26,450 --> 00:19:32,100
we had school ID and nobody every
student discounts

297
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:35,580
a trial you can do that sort of thing

298
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:40,270
it's so probably an expression of

299
00:19:40,270 --> 00:19:44,490
untreatable paranoia if you do just
don't give people your

300
00:19:44,490 --> 00:19:48,600
expressed a

301
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:53,150
how can or how much does it cost to do
this because

302
00:19:53,150 --> 00:19:56,630
just because this mission is available
how much does it cost for somebody like

303
00:19:56,630 --> 00:20:00,840
you for me to find somebody do anything

304
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:04,389
when you say do this you talk about the
past four things are investigating so no

305
00:20:04,390 --> 00:20:05,150
no no I mean

306
00:20:05,150 --> 00:20:08,350
just like oh you said find all my
religion say

307
00:20:08,350 --> 00:20:15,350
pretty cheap I to begin with there or

308
00:20:15,820 --> 00:20:19,700
let's say I want to find out if you're
jewish I

309
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:23,830
which I am save your money a

310
00:20:23,830 --> 00:20:26,929
there's a company called AB data at New
Jersey

311
00:20:26,930 --> 00:20:30,830
a period the period data that has just
about

312
00:20:30,830 --> 00:20:34,120
every adult June the United States on a
database

313
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:37,730
I am there's a database called committed

314
00:20:37,730 --> 00:20:41,300
catholics I didn't name it I

315
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:44,880
which just 25 million I'll

316
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:49,630
members are church groups or people who
I don't notes and I don't know how they

317
00:20:49,630 --> 00:20:52,500
get the list send money to the Vatican
or whatever

318
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:56,540
that you can purchase there are

319
00:20:56,540 --> 00:21:01,600
a baptists lists there are certain
things that you can use to extrapolate

320
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:03,860
out if you want the SP use other

321
00:21:03,860 --> 00:21:07,929
Baptist University chances are your
names not goldberg

322
00:21:07,929 --> 00:21:11,230
a there there are many many ways

323
00:21:11,230 --> 00:21:14,560
I if you give money to been a breath

324
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:17,879
you're probably not father all-male

325
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:21,630
I and so on and so forth I'll the dollar
amount

326
00:21:21,630 --> 00:21:26,220
dollar amount to parents you know you're
asking like how long is a little

327
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:30,690
how long is a like the strain it depends
specifically what you want to find out

328
00:21:30,690 --> 00:21:34,510
and what you already know about the
purse

329
00:21:34,510 --> 00:21:38,290
it can range from a hundred dollars to a
thousand dollars

330
00:21:38,290 --> 00:21:41,800
but in no case is going to be more than
1000 bucks

331
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:45,060
a less you got soccer and if you're

332
00:21:45,060 --> 00:21:49,840
intent on spending that kinda money I'll
give you my business card after the talk

333
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:54,330
thank you sure Paul

334
00:21:54,330 --> 00:21:57,879
I someone's point

335
00:21:57,880 --> 00:22:01,720
are all repeat your question

336
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:08,720
I can barely hear it so

337
00:22:41,490 --> 00:22:44,450
the question was we drifter

338
00:22:44,450 --> 00:22:49,890
of the topic I what do I think about
Bill Gates and

339
00:22:49,890 --> 00:22:52,960
the development of search engines and

340
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:56,840
closed communities online as opposed to
open communities

341
00:22:56,840 --> 00:23:01,230
for so I'm I'm a Mac guy so I hate bill
gates

342
00:23:01,230 --> 00:23:05,790
I the its

343
00:23:05,790 --> 00:23:09,200
I as far as

344
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:14,800
as far as search engines and things like
that i've a two-part answer number one i

345
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:17,110
think search engines are wonderful they
make

346
00:23:17,110 --> 00:23:21,250
your life easier they make my life
easier not just for investigating I mean

347
00:23:21,250 --> 00:23:22,540
if I want to find out about

348
00:23:22,540 --> 00:23:26,220
tonga I want to just be able to type in
Tonga

349
00:23:26,220 --> 00:23:33,190
I that's the short answer the slightly
longer answers

350
00:23:33,190 --> 00:23:37,690
if you don't want someone to find out
about you want to find out about your

351
00:23:37,690 --> 00:23:39,410
opinions or to find out

352
00:23:39,410 --> 00:23:44,060
about your likes and dislikes don't post
to use into

353
00:23:44,060 --> 00:23:47,080
I mean keep your opinions to yourself

354
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:51,460
I as far as clothes communities verses
open communities

355
00:23:51,460 --> 00:23:56,250
also an obvious answer there are some
communities that should be close

356
00:23:56,250 --> 00:24:02,080
if you have an aids discussion group I
think it should probably be if you are

357
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:02,649
gonna diss

358
00:24:02,650 --> 00:24:06,410
if it's a group of people are suffering
from aids I think it should be on a

359
00:24:06,410 --> 00:24:08,070
password protected server

360
00:24:08,070 --> 00:24:13,040
even on a dialogue has a post on the net
if you're talking about

361
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:18,149
a the mating habits of Parana the Gucci
Group B River

362
00:24:18,150 --> 00:24:23,180
I I really don't think it matters if
it's a open User Group I

363
00:24:23,180 --> 00:24:27,230
I do I i do know what you're getting at
the whole or

364
00:24:27,230 --> 00:24:31,620
issue of of people buying of

365
00:24:31,620 --> 00:24:34,800
more and more and more of

366
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:37,960
band worth services and data collection

367
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:43,000
for example Bill Gates buying the
company that manufactures quicken

368
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:47,250
scared the hell outta price quicken
facilitates online banking

369
00:24:47,250 --> 00:24:51,600
and the last thing I want is on is Bill
Gates to be able to have access to my

370
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:54,080
banking transactions in crib that are
otherwise

371
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:57,300
I am or Bill Gates is little

372
00:24:57,300 --> 00:25:00,810
elves in Redmond I am but again

373
00:25:00,810 --> 00:25:05,169
its it's sorta the same it so that I
gave this fellow here if you don't want

374
00:25:05,170 --> 00:25:06,320
people to know

375
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:10,550
things about you and don't want it to to
be able to access it online by god don't

376
00:25:10,550 --> 00:25:11,639
put it online

377
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:15,020
it won't be there I you know

378
00:25:15,020 --> 00:25:17,500
teddy roosevelt the

379
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:20,120
had a a how to say

380
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:24,080
nobody ever heard what was insert it
goes online

381
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:29,699
it go the same thing goes online next
question colleges

382
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:32,759
like to have your %ah social security
number and so on and so forth

383
00:25:32,759 --> 00:25:36,409
right arm you know required to give it
to them by is it legal to give them a

384
00:25:36,409 --> 00:25:38,610
fake social security number at least if
you're

385
00:25:38,610 --> 00:25:41,970
night if you don't go there real simple
answer

386
00:25:41,970 --> 00:25:45,929
you're applying for student aid gotta
give your social security numbers they

387
00:25:45,929 --> 00:25:48,700
gotta check your deserve it I'll

388
00:25:48,700 --> 00:25:52,299
if you're not applying for student day
I'll

389
00:25:52,299 --> 00:25:56,918
you can request that they assign you a
student identity number

390
00:25:56,919 --> 00:26:02,110
in lieu of your social security number
that that is the law of the land pretty

391
00:26:02,110 --> 00:26:02,649
much

392
00:26:02,649 --> 00:26:07,159
even if you are applying for student
date many many colleges allow you to

393
00:26:07,159 --> 00:26:08,549
apply for student day

394
00:26:08,549 --> 00:26:11,690
but have a different student ID number
which

395
00:26:11,690 --> 00:26:14,960
a to be making my job harder but it's
probably a good idea

396
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:19,629
and any well fine touch social security
number anyway what if

397
00:26:19,629 --> 00:26:23,120
when you're requesting like junk mail
colleges and so on

398
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:26,309
i'd they just like daggers Australia for
their

399
00:26:26,309 --> 00:26:29,740
accounting purposes and I say that again
they'll

400
00:26:29,740 --> 00:26:33,090
be like for their like it when their
databases your social security

401
00:26:33,090 --> 00:26:36,389
when you when they want to send your
junk mail her

402
00:26:36,389 --> 00:26:40,460
sign for all put all zeros believe me

403
00:26:40,460 --> 00:26:44,899
some harassed five dollar-an-hour clerk
will not send your request back to you

404
00:26:44,899 --> 00:26:46,230
ask if your social security

405
00:26:46,230 --> 00:26:53,230
SAR

406
00:26:53,619 --> 00:26:56,960
I just had a an important caveat about
pay

407
00:26:56,960 --> 00:27:01,960
cash for everything I paid cash from
airline ticket to get here

408
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:05,739
in my bag was searched not only was my
bag searched

409
00:27:05,739 --> 00:27:09,989
my pockets but security agent tasted the
frosting

410
00:27:09,989 --> 00:27:14,950
my cupcake no lie tasted the process

411
00:27:14,950 --> 00:27:19,429
well that have a debit debit card what
do you think about debit cards

412
00:27:19,429 --> 00:27:22,570
well I think about what was the debit
cards

413
00:27:22,570 --> 00:27:26,590
debit cards in terms of invasion of
privacy or

414
00:27:26,590 --> 00:27:31,450
absolutely meaningless in comparison to
credit cards they put the same

415
00:27:31,450 --> 00:27:33,139
information in the same place

416
00:27:33,139 --> 00:27:37,879
I and by the way you got searched
because one of the key

417
00:27:37,879 --> 00:27:41,269
components the airline terrorism
profiling is

418
00:27:41,269 --> 00:27:44,739
paid cash know it really is

419
00:27:44,739 --> 00:27:47,979
paid cash male traveling alone

420
00:27:47,979 --> 00:27:51,320
with 10 the or with one other person

421
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:56,029
between the ages 25 and 45 those other
publicly known ones I won't give you the

422
00:27:56,029 --> 00:27:57,330
rest in case you're

423
00:27:57,330 --> 00:28:02,228
from hamas a II will

424
00:28:02,229 --> 00:28:06,609
I will tell you that as far as Airlines
Co they will not give up your name if

425
00:28:06,609 --> 00:28:10,379
you pay by credit card because they
don't want the other airlines to recruit

426
00:28:10,379 --> 00:28:10,659
you

427
00:28:10,659 --> 00:28:14,940
the only time the airline start
releasing your information is if you

428
00:28:14,940 --> 00:28:19,119
join a frequent flyer program they sell
all their frequent-flyer lists

429
00:28:19,119 --> 00:28:22,269
to travel magazines and tour companies
and water

430
00:28:22,269 --> 00:28:26,229
so if you fly continental but don't join
one pass

431
00:28:26,229 --> 00:28:30,729
you're pretty so wouldn't know debit
card not fall under

432
00:28:30,729 --> 00:28:35,279
TRW's jurisdiction yeah those are all

433
00:28:35,279 --> 00:28:40,039
everything falls in the territories
jurisdiction alright thanks

434
00:28:40,039 --> 00:28:43,179
II rockwell let me tell you that when
you

435
00:28:43,179 --> 00:28:47,239
opened your bank account to which the
debit card

436
00:28:47,239 --> 00:28:53,369
is attached TRW TransUnion and CBIR
perfect got your day

437
00:28:53,369 --> 00:28:57,679
don't worry about the car they get you
at the first step

438
00:28:57,679 --> 00:29:01,419
in fact wanna talk at the fell about
colleges they

439
00:29:01,419 --> 00:29:04,970
by the list of students from every

440
00:29:04,970 --> 00:29:08,279
college because people who are
graduating from college a better credit

441
00:29:08,279 --> 00:29:08,980
risks

442
00:29:08,980 --> 00:29:13,779
in theory I wasn't but better credit
risks that people who don't graduate

443
00:29:13,779 --> 00:29:15,049
from college

444
00:29:15,049 --> 00:29:20,480
every situation where you give your name
and private information to someone

445
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:24,470
tell them you dole wanna be on mailing
lists

446
00:29:24,470 --> 00:29:28,070
it's called opting out opt out

447
00:29:28,070 --> 00:29:33,080
next what if I didn't

448
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:37,789
mind getting John man I didn't wanna
really high

449
00:29:37,789 --> 00:29:41,629
by using cash all the time not putting
my my

450
00:29:41,629 --> 00:29:46,549
social security number makes things much
more inconvenient like I know that you

451
00:29:46,549 --> 00:29:47,529
can pay cash

452
00:29:47,529 --> 00:29:50,769
and hotel Prince for rent a car

453
00:29:50,769 --> 00:29:55,429
you need a credit card right if I don't
have anything to hide

454
00:29:55,429 --> 00:29:59,210
hey why should I be free short

455
00:29:59,210 --> 00:30:03,929
you absent know is right he's absolutely
right and that's the point

456
00:30:03,929 --> 00:30:07,080
that's the point that I was hopefully

457
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:10,320
making earlier there is no CNN

458
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:13,960
no harm being a property ownership
database

459
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:17,820
or in a voter registration database if
you're not

460
00:30:17,820 --> 00:30:21,509
a shame that you write that that you
vote for the

461
00:30:21,509 --> 00:30:25,919
the gravity party there's no reason

462
00:30:25,919 --> 00:30:29,859
not to be in voter registration the fact
of the matter is

463
00:30:29,859 --> 00:30:33,730
that damage it does to you is far less

464
00:30:33,730 --> 00:30:39,089
by leaving the records open then the
damage to the community at large by

465
00:30:39,089 --> 00:30:40,489
keeping them close:

466
00:30:40,489 --> 00:30:43,629
the gentleman's absolutely right there
years

467
00:30:43,629 --> 00:30:47,320
no real reason to to to hide

468
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:51,080
most who you are and what you do boast a
few I assume

469
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:54,720
are pretty proud of who you are and what
you do and

470
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:57,979
there's no reason to hide I

471
00:30:57,979 --> 00:31:01,989
as far as if you wanna get letters were
if you want to get shot me know what do

472
00:31:01,989 --> 00:31:02,470
you do

473
00:31:02,470 --> 00:31:05,899
do nothing go find male

474
00:31:05,899 --> 00:31:09,720
ever question about Sun practice so

475
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:14,220
using social security number as a
universal identifiers such is our health

476
00:31:14,220 --> 00:31:16,690
insurance companies are increasingly
using

477
00:31:16,690 --> 00:31:20,570
social security number as the
individuals ID number for their purposes

478
00:31:20,570 --> 00:31:23,799
right is actually very good reason for
that

479
00:31:23,799 --> 00:31:28,289
a huge part of my business is
investigating health care fraud

480
00:31:28,289 --> 00:31:32,259
disability fraud fraudulent death claims
you would be amazed

481
00:31:32,259 --> 00:31:38,099
how many people kill themselves they go
out to get an alternate identity which I

482
00:31:38,099 --> 00:31:41,460
gotta tell you is terrifically easy to
do especially if you're from

483
00:31:41,460 --> 00:31:45,019
Yemen we did about 20 cases in a row

484
00:31:45,019 --> 00:31:49,159
people who came from Yemen applied for
asylum

485
00:31:49,159 --> 00:31:53,759
got social security number before they
rented an apartment they took out life

486
00:31:53,759 --> 00:31:55,220
insurance

487
00:31:55,220 --> 00:31:59,970
I'll went back to Yemen died and a camel
accident

488
00:31:59,970 --> 00:32:01,130
I

489
00:32:01,130 --> 00:32:06,000
and their beneficiary put in a claim it
just so happened in most of those cases

490
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:10,080
the beneficiary was really them and they
applied under a phony name

491
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:13,570
so when it comes to your

492
00:32:13,570 --> 00:32:18,419
give me a break thank you

493
00:32:18,420 --> 00:32:21,560
Utah like the talk or you're bored

494
00:32:21,560 --> 00:32:28,260
go in the other room I the

495
00:32:28,260 --> 00:32:31,390
their their are actually very good

496
00:32:31,390 --> 00:32:34,650
very valid non privacy invading reasons

497
00:32:34,650 --> 00:32:38,250
but if you or again concerned

498
00:32:38,250 --> 00:32:42,090
here for example the health insurance
program a greater New York

499
00:32:42,090 --> 00:32:45,510
will allow you to have a different
medical ID number

500
00:32:45,510 --> 00:32:49,570
no just keep your social security number
on their files Knox

501
00:32:49,570 --> 00:32:52,939
a follow-up to that question I am

502
00:32:52,940 --> 00:32:58,010
I have found out myself that you don't
have to give your social security number

503
00:32:58,010 --> 00:32:59,690
to a credit card company

504
00:32:59,690 --> 00:33:05,220
you will get less credit you enter the
five thousand my to 2000 stop

505
00:33:05,220 --> 00:33:08,900
I I i've done that with a mouse charge

506
00:33:08,900 --> 00:33:12,010
company but I was wondering

507
00:33:12,010 --> 00:33:16,710
I on the is not an exposure related to

508
00:33:16,710 --> 00:33:20,520
let your social security number around
freely

509
00:33:20,520 --> 00:33:23,730
isn't that the keyway fraudulent

510
00:33:23,730 --> 00:33:27,260
I you can be taken

511
00:33:27,260 --> 00:33:31,560
Rancho was not it's not a keyway it's
certainly a big help

512
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:37,379
it's not the keyword if you got credit
cards without giving your social

513
00:33:37,380 --> 00:33:38,850
security number maybe you're just

514
00:33:38,850 --> 00:33:42,250
a terrifically trustworthy looking guy
usually doesn't work

515
00:33:42,250 --> 00:33:46,420
I by the way just as an aside

516
00:33:46,420 --> 00:33:52,450
there are now about 30 or 40 thanks
primarily in the carribean the largest

517
00:33:52,450 --> 00:33:54,310
one of which is called Swiss American

518
00:33:54,310 --> 00:33:58,629
back which will give you a credit card
not a debit card

519
00:33:58,630 --> 00:34:02,580
but which functions the same way as a
credit card you put

520
00:34:02,580 --> 00:34:07,150
for example ten thousand dollars on the
POS and they will give you seventy five

521
00:34:07,150 --> 00:34:08,159
hundred dollar

522
00:34:08,159 --> 00:34:12,100
line of credit on a MasterCard or Visa a

523
00:34:12,100 --> 00:34:15,799
it for the most part Hartcher
transactions they don't care about your

524
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:19,110
social security number in fact they
don't even care about your real name

525
00:34:19,110 --> 00:34:24,780
a another thing that you can do is when
you apply for a credit card apply for

526
00:34:24,780 --> 00:34:26,230
dinner multiple names

527
00:34:26,230 --> 00:34:29,659
when they send you that little thing
saying would you like to put anyone else

528
00:34:29,659 --> 00:34:30,450
on your cock

529
00:34:30,449 --> 00:34:35,199
say yes I'd like to put mister

530
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:39,350
richard nixon on my car and they will
send the card to your house with the

531
00:34:39,350 --> 00:34:40,600
name richard nixon daughter

532
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:46,130
go out i'm by deterring cars in the name
of richard nixon and it makes a

533
00:34:46,130 --> 00:34:50,120
makes you much much harder to track but
again as a rule

534
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:54,120
credit card companies have a really good
reason

535
00:34:54,120 --> 00:34:57,430
to watch your social security number
they want to know

536
00:34:57,430 --> 00:35:01,169
if you tend to shoot about 500 bills
across the US

537
00:35:01,170 --> 00:35:04,310
and now you're looking for for the line
to credit so you can scam

538
00:35:04,310 --> 00:35:08,370
I am I'm in the middle of the case

539
00:35:08,370 --> 00:35:12,930
work I came to this country his real
name was shrill well I won't give you is

540
00:35:12,930 --> 00:35:13,450
less

541
00:35:13,450 --> 00:35:19,259
he came to this country he went we apply
for a credit card the name of Tony

542
00:35:19,260 --> 00:35:24,640
I will give you his last name and he is
now living in France after having

543
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:28,819
scam american express at about thirty
thousand dollars

544
00:35:28,820 --> 00:35:33,950
some you may think that's pretty good
american express dozen

545
00:35:33,950 --> 00:35:38,390
day probably should have checked is
background and his credit a little more

546
00:35:38,390 --> 00:35:39,000
closely

547
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:43,730
I but there weren't enough bells and
whistles in their computer os:

548
00:35:43,730 --> 00:35:48,480
a credit approval program to catch the
guy he was very good and he's

549
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:51,550
is a professional the sort a

550
00:35:51,550 --> 00:35:56,640
I'm after because he also decided he was
disabled even though he owns about

551
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:59,640
seven homes three business is claiming

552
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:05,240
disability age next question as when I'm
what you knew about the

553
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:08,630
the new records are keeping immigration
coming into the country

554
00:36:08,630 --> 00:36:12,480
and a more specifically I had a friend
you went back to england

555
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:16,090
and the visa waiver sure to fill out a
card in hand to the airline

556
00:36:16,090 --> 00:36:20,230
as the airline hand that back to the
government they

557
00:36:20,230 --> 00:36:23,550
don't hand it to the government it goes
he had lied to the cop

558
00:36:23,550 --> 00:36:28,390
there or man that's a whole nother talk

559
00:36:28,390 --> 00:36:32,129
there are government databases that you
would not believe

560
00:36:32,130 --> 00:36:36,700
the most people are upset by social
security they're upset by and see I say

561
00:36:36,700 --> 00:36:40,290
there's a database maintained by our

562
00:36:40,290 --> 00:36:45,400
very secret outfit called Finance &
Financial Center

563
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:48,500
in virginia which has all your bank
transactions

564
00:36:48,500 --> 00:36:53,380
or your taxes stuff I can even begin to
go into

565
00:36:53,380 --> 00:36:57,360
the cost the database used by customs
they used to do something called texting

566
00:36:57,360 --> 00:36:58,770
ECS

567
00:36:58,770 --> 00:37:01,880
was replaced by TCS to text to

568
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:05,860
now they have something called NL ETS
national think its national law

569
00:37:05,860 --> 00:37:08,750
enforcement tracking system

570
00:37:08,750 --> 00:37:12,980
every law enforcement every federal
agency is on it

571
00:37:12,980 --> 00:37:16,570
FBI Secret Service customs immigration
everything

572
00:37:16,570 --> 00:37:21,190
you will notice that at major ports of
entry

573
00:37:21,190 --> 00:37:25,610
Anna almost all overseas ticket counters

574
00:37:25,610 --> 00:37:29,560
the airlines now have the reader for
your passport

575
00:37:29,560 --> 00:37:33,080
they scan your passport code and your

576
00:37:33,080 --> 00:37:36,380
bar-coded because into the computer
program

577
00:37:36,380 --> 00:37:42,110
it is sent directly to the US when you
arrive in the US

578
00:37:42,110 --> 00:37:46,060
that lists the passengers has already
been screened

579
00:37:46,060 --> 00:37:49,390
against the customs toplist against the
NCIC war

580
00:37:49,390 --> 00:37:53,589
most and against a Sicilian all other
lists

581
00:37:53,590 --> 00:37:58,170
if you were even questions by a federal
agency

582
00:37:58,170 --> 00:38:01,360
it is put in that computer now

583
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:06,020
again this is a double-edge sword if I
lived in Milwaukee I was questioned

584
00:38:06,020 --> 00:38:06,350
about

585
00:38:06,350 --> 00:38:11,230
chopping up an old woman that was found
buried in my front yard

586
00:38:11,230 --> 00:38:14,380
and I'm now living in Miami

587
00:38:14,380 --> 00:38:17,400
and someone's questioning me about
chopping up an old woman was found

588
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:19,930
buried in my front yard

589
00:38:19,930 --> 00:38:23,359
it's something that the government
should know so

590
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:26,940
filing little news show on people

591
00:38:26,940 --> 00:38:30,950
is not always an unnecessary invasion of
privacy would be astounded

592
00:38:30,950 --> 00:38:34,270
how many really really bad guys that
that Univ

593
00:38:34,270 --> 00:38:39,740
to one of the street a quarter however
again there's a potential for abuse

594
00:38:39,740 --> 00:38:43,770
here for you lived next door to

595
00:38:43,770 --> 00:38:48,660
Pablo the big cocaine smuggler when you
a question by the DEA

596
00:38:48,660 --> 00:38:52,819
and the guy wasn't too lazy to type up
this case notes

597
00:38:52,820 --> 00:38:58,280
and feed them into lats which is
supposed to do

598
00:38:58,280 --> 00:39:02,840
if you're on a flight coming back from
columbia for no other reason

599
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:06,970
after the then you really want to see
bogota

600
00:39:06,970 --> 00:39:13,200
once before you died you will have dogs
sniffing your pockets

601
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:16,920
I am yes you are

602
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:20,580
you are immediately fed into the system

603
00:39:20,580 --> 00:39:23,670
and how come at my friend who left on

604
00:39:23,670 --> 00:39:27,130
virgin at JFK she had a card to the
Virgin

605
00:39:27,130 --> 00:39:31,010
a ticket woman their green card to hear
about your passport

606
00:39:31,010 --> 00:39:34,710
when you leave the country its
approaches are US citizens

607
00:39:34,710 --> 00:39:37,750
no she's not a US test

608
00:39:37,750 --> 00:39:42,730
well your your because Bergen it's a
government cost-cutting measure

609
00:39:42,730 --> 00:39:47,710
I all of the airlines are obligated to
do the following:

610
00:39:47,710 --> 00:39:52,350
security screening reporting anyone who
meets the profile there's a few things I

611
00:39:52,350 --> 00:39:53,580
want to

612
00:39:53,580 --> 00:39:56,690
they're responsible for taking all your
passport information

613
00:39:56,690 --> 00:40:00,300
that's why they step you take it this is
Dax TOCs okay

614
00:40:00,300 --> 00:40:04,540
means documents okay they've been
shocked and they are also responsible

615
00:40:04,540 --> 00:40:08,710
for collecting all of the government
required forms

616
00:40:08,710 --> 00:40:11,900
otherwise they have to hire a whole
bunch of other guys to

617
00:40:11,900 --> 00:40:15,530
just stand there like an idiot do
nothing but say form

618
00:40:15,530 --> 00:40:19,700
form lot of countries that do that they
need to employ

619
00:40:19,700 --> 00:40:24,260
you know seventeen people from each
village in theory in the United States

620
00:40:24,260 --> 00:40:28,800
were computerize for a modern nation
were suppose to

621
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:32,400
be manpower intelligent that's why they
do

622
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:37,570
I think your real question was does the
airline have access to this information

623
00:40:37,570 --> 00:40:42,440
and doesn't go in their databases yes it
does

624
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:47,980
next question well one thing I want to
say was in New York State you can apply

625
00:40:47,980 --> 00:40:51,810
for dead guy's license because the keep
your picture now on

626
00:40:51,810 --> 00:40:55,420
file you don't have to go back
picture-taking anymore

627
00:40:55,420 --> 00:40:58,870
thing just right to you and what if you
are from

628
00:40:58,870 --> 00:41:02,799
higher walk you get a date guys

629
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:07,310
birth certificate and Iowa have you
moved to the United States by the way to

630
00:41:07,310 --> 00:41:09,990
run the scan try not to talk with a
broken axle

631
00:41:09,990 --> 00:41:13,780
I could oversaw you go to the DMV

632
00:41:13,780 --> 00:41:18,180
ft got dead guy from higher let's just
call it that guy

633
00:41:18,180 --> 00:41:22,569
if you've got date guys replacement
social security number

634
00:41:22,570 --> 00:41:25,680
which by the way they don't ask you for
real a

635
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:30,290
after you've got a credit card and the
name dead guy

636
00:41:30,290 --> 00:41:35,730

rent an apartment in the name of that

637
00:41:35,730 --> 00:41:36,690

638
00:41:36,690 --> 00:41:40,040
or hopefully you're smart enough or
cheapen of

639
00:41:40,040 --> 00:41:44,000
to get a mail drop in the name of that
guy you go with this

640
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:48,090
Iowa that guy's information you so or

641
00:41:48,090 --> 00:41:52,470

00:46:30,599 --> 00:46:35,930
obvious I databases publicly accessible
through the web databases

everything from switchboard 241 want all
that good stuff arm

716

00:47:05,480 --> 00:47:08,920
god bless these people I'll you know

722
00:47:08,920 --> 00:47:12,109

723
00:47:12,109 --> 00:47:17,430

724
00:47:17,430 --> 00:47:21,040
big the police to find my

725
00:47:21,040 --> 00:47:26,170
long-lost uncle Harry all I've got to do
is go on for 11 dot com

726
00:47:26,170 --> 00:47:30,790

thank I'm calling Harry in two minutes I
am

728
00:47:35,190 --> 00:47:40,220
most of the really good information out
there

729
00:47:40,220 --> 00:47:44,599
our proprietary databases they cost a
small fortune to compile

730
00:47:44,599 --> 00:47:48,060
take it from me they take ur across the
small fortune to compile

731
00:47:48,060 --> 00:47:52,009
and they are fee-based service so you
have to pay something together

732
00:47:52,010 --> 00:47:55,160
I if you wanna talk to me later talk to
me

733
00:47:55,160 --> 00:47:59,220
it would really I that's a whole nother
talk I don't know if it's gonna be

734
00:47:59,220 --> 00:48:05,010
for the panel tonight or a manual has
other plans for me

735
00:48:05,010 --> 00:48:08,200
but it really would take about an hour
to go into the

736
00:48:08,200 --> 00:48:13,300
said that you didn't think

737
00:48:13,300 --> 00:48:17,160
thats sure so what I can hear you've
already said even databases

738
00:48:17,160 --> 00:48:21,319
out there dangerous I don't think
databases database

739
00:48:21,319 --> 00:48:24,700
you happy information you don't feel it
is dangerous have that

740
00:48:24,700 --> 00:48:28,400
no I don't alright you want me

741
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:32,310
Dikshit future say what willing to make
a little prediction about future

742
00:48:32,310 --> 00:48:35,849
and tell me what you think we like 10
years are protecting your privacy

743
00:48:35,849 --> 00:48:42,849
to very good question to really really
because

744
00:48:42,910 --> 00:48:46,348
I think 10 years is here now

745
00:48:46,349 --> 00:48:49,750
I I I know that sure

746
00:48:49,750 --> 00:48:55,270
like warmed up by talking I am

747
00:48:55,270 --> 00:48:58,670
I I think you're asking me

748
00:48:58,670 --> 00:49:05,060
how impressive how frightening will
these databases be in 10 years

749
00:49:05,060 --> 00:49:08,830
not any more impressive a frightening
than they are now let me tell you

750
00:49:08,830 --> 00:49:13,529
everything is already accessible and I
can cross reference information

751
00:49:13,530 --> 00:49:17,800
and predict things about you with
ninety-nine point nine percent certainty

752
00:49:17,800 --> 00:49:21,540
that are into database I am

753
00:49:21,540 --> 00:49:26,589
I'll give you an example before gay
magazine started selling their mailing

754
00:49:26,589 --> 00:49:27,230
lists

755
00:49:27,230 --> 00:49:32,520
a lot of people one out there and just
simply searched for two people of the

756
00:49:32,520 --> 00:49:33,560
same sex

757
00:49:33,560 --> 00:49:37,080
living together who had gone through one

758
00:49:37,080 --> 00:49:41,460
move together another excuse to people
these two guys are these two girls live

759
00:49:41,460 --> 00:49:42,359
here

760
00:49:42,359 --> 00:49:46,660
now they both live here there's a really
good chance there get

761
00:49:46,660 --> 00:49:50,399
and it turned out to be true you can
extrapolate

762
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:55,859
out two things right now because the
computing power is amazing

763
00:49:55,859 --> 00:50:00,080
let me tell you that other than the
government the few people

764
00:50:00,080 --> 00:50:03,150
all by cray supercomputers

765
00:50:03,150 --> 00:50:06,190
are each wanted the credit bureaus

766
00:50:06,190 --> 00:50:10,140
that's absolutely true because it's
amazing what they can do

767
00:50:10,140 --> 00:50:13,259
I am if you or

768
00:50:13,260 --> 00:50:16,830
if I'm ollie north guard for

769
00:50:16,830 --> 00:50:20,560
and I wanna find out always going to

770
00:50:20,560 --> 00:50:25,480

bills or my run for Senator or my run

771
00:50:25,480 --> 00:50:26,220
for

772
00:50:26,220 --> 00:50:30,099
dictator I am how do I do it

773
00:50:30,099 --> 00:50:35,369
well I go to a zip code where most
people are very conservative

774
00:50:35,369 --> 00:50:40,480
I get a list of all the voters I make
sure the conservative by finding out

775
00:50:40,480 --> 00:50:43,900
that they vote Republican and a
cross-reference over the list an RA

776
00:50:43,900 --> 00:50:45,010
people

777
00:50:45,010 --> 00:50:48,230
I've got people nine out of turn we're
going to contribute to my

778
00:50:48,230 --> 00:50:51,810
to my campaign even if it's like some a

779
00:50:51,810 --> 00:50:55,859
nitroglycerin soaked and mail to me and

780
00:50:55,859 --> 00:51:00,670
in a free mailing envelope I should
answer

781
00:51:00,670 --> 00:51:03,720
you are allowed to have your by the way
there's a guy out there

782
00:51:03,720 --> 00:51:08,170
say is no if I was a hacker there's a
guy with the table out there he stopped

783
00:51:08,170 --> 00:51:09,810
for Sky iraq

784
00:51:09,810 --> 00:51:16,369
the CEMEX he makes ollie north look like
a mcgovern democrat

785
00:51:16,369 --> 00:51:19,420
I but not that I would suggest

786
00:51:19,420 --> 00:51:22,650
pick on people because of their
political points of view

787
00:51:22,650 --> 00:51:27,660
no matter how fascistic and ridiculous
they may be

788
00:51:27,660 --> 00:51:31,839
I

789
00:51:31,839 --> 00:51:36,259
goes by Dennis Miller matters

790
00:51:36,260 --> 00:51:39,930
I am I don't think ten years from now

791
00:51:39,930 --> 00:51:43,589
databases are gonna be any more
remarkable than they are now what I do

792
00:51:43,589 --> 00:51:44,549
think

793
00:51:44,549 --> 00:51:49,580
when I'm sure others those capabilities
are going to be more widely use

794
00:51:49,580 --> 00:51:53,848
I I think that private investigators for
example

795
00:51:53,849 --> 00:51:58,030
are going to start doing demographic and
psychographic profiling

796
00:51:58,030 --> 00:52:02,250
of people they're investigating I
already do that if I'm investigating you

797
00:52:02,250 --> 00:52:05,869
and the client has on of money for the
budget

798
00:52:05,869 --> 00:52:09,339
our corporate borrowers there's nothing
we can find out there's

799
00:52:09,339 --> 00:52:13,130
clients who just run out of money arm

800
00:52:13,130 --> 00:52:17,369
a joke that was the other throwaway line
I am

801
00:52:17,369 --> 00:52:21,040
we already do that in big-ticket cases
I'll

802
00:52:21,040 --> 00:52:24,290
we do that a murder case if the guys
really innocent

803
00:52:24,290 --> 00:52:27,799
weed or Trojan I am

804
00:52:27,799 --> 00:52:31,420
I think that well I can tell you right
now

805
00:52:31,420 --> 00:52:34,440
the Trans Union already sells

806
00:52:34,440 --> 00:52:37,480
the header information top

807
00:52:37,480 --> 00:52:40,599
all of their credit reports meaning name

808
00:52:40,599 --> 00:52:43,780
a truss phone number

809
00:52:43,780 --> 00:52:48,339
age not date of birth age to the owner
home to they own a car

810
00:52:48,339 --> 00:52:52,859
few other little are they new homebuyer
are there new car buyer

811
00:52:52,859 --> 00:52:56,339
and a few other key pieces of
information you can go and buy

812
00:52:56,339 --> 00:52:59,730
all the information on

813
00:52:59,730 --> 00:53:02,920
see the five or six CD-rom's

814
00:53:02,920 --> 00:53:06,579
and they so you licenses over the phone
if you want all the

815
00:53:06,579 --> 00:53:09,910
females in your zip code

816
00:53:09,910 --> 00:53:14,740
between the age of 20 and 25 to drive

817
00:53:14,740 --> 00:53:19,520
volkswagens have enough money to own a
house and i know i do

818
00:53:19,520 --> 00:53:23,660
I am you can buy it from and you can
call them up

819
00:53:23,660 --> 00:53:27,779
you can get an activation code right on
the phone by giving them your

820
00:53:27,780 --> 00:53:31,049
your MasterCard or Visa a

821
00:53:31,049 --> 00:53:36,020
MasterCard or Visa and they will give
you an activation code that allow you to

822
00:53:36,020 --> 00:53:38,490
pull however many records you pay for

823
00:53:38,490 --> 00:53:41,869
so all the capabilities are already
there

824
00:53:41,869 --> 00:53:45,690
big business is doing it marketing
companies are doing it

825
00:53:45,690 --> 00:53:49,549
that government is buying these lists
left and right

826
00:53:49,549 --> 00:53:54,240
I'm that's really true all those big
brother fears are really justified in

827
00:53:54,240 --> 00:53:56,339
that area

828
00:53:56,339 --> 00:54:00,099
bought the big change is gonna be that
you and I are gonna start doing that

829
00:54:00,099 --> 00:54:01,520
sort

830
00:54:01,520 --> 00:54:05,890
I am the heart of a manual where are you
hear tony took

831
00:54:05,890 --> 00:54:09,040

832
00:54:09,040 --> 00:54:12,109

833
00:54:12,109 --> 00:54:16,900

834
00:54:16,900 --> 00:54:20,099

high tax bracket whether you like it or

845
00:55:03,529 --> 00:55:04,750

846
00:55:04,750 --> 00:55:08,170
of you know

847
00:55:08,170 --> 00:55:11,500

if you wanna go to the male Asian
embassy an offer to emigrate they take

849
00:55:15,680 --> 00:55:16,760
in RP

850
00:55:16,760 --> 00:55:20,960
america wants you nobody's interest that
that suppressing this convention there

851
00:55:20,960 --> 00:55:23,599
are a couple Schmucks out there

852
00:55:23,599 --> 00:55:27,000
who give hackers a bad name and that's
unfortunate but

853
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:31,069
mostly a geyser pretty good guys as far
as law enforcement is concerned

854
00:55:31,069 --> 00:55:35,750
taken from me I know

855
00:55:35,750 --> 00:55:39,000
nevermind I was in Iraq provision was
about the site

856
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:43,940
there was a compliment a 1% chance to
get to swirled

857
00:55:43,940 --> 00:55:47,119
about six months ago i think is about
six or eight months ago you're not

858
00:55:47,119 --> 00:55:51,010
supposed to be asking this question see
this is why when really it's just lust

859
00:55:51,010 --> 00:55:55,890
okay I about six or eight months ago 411
removed its reverse phone number search

860
00:55:55,890 --> 00:55:57,720
from a

861
00:55:57,720 --> 00:56:00,730
as one of its services as other there's
a there's

862
00:56:00,730 --> 00:56:04,490
it was really useful I found
incorporating that with caller ID

863
00:56:04,490 --> 00:56:07,849
and I you know I had to the property
stolen within that hour and advertised

864
00:56:07,849 --> 00:56:10,680
in the paper had sat on the side of a
road people are calling me

865
00:56:10,680 --> 00:56:14,680
taunting ahead when I went to use that I
found out that was gone

866
00:56:14,680 --> 00:56:20,210
well i e-mailed a yes at a a comment to
the people that ran a service may say

867
00:56:20,210 --> 00:56:21,290
I'm sorry that

868
00:56:21,290 --> 00:56:24,799
we had to remove it due to security
reasons but how much would you be

869
00:56:24,799 --> 00:56:26,500
willing to pay for this service

870
00:56:26,500 --> 00:56:31,680
your achievement guy you're too cheap to
go out by Pro for

871
00:56:31,680 --> 00:56:35,520
that's just the CE where I could do that
that is ax anyway

872
00:56:35,520 --> 00:56:41,680
live fact that size said well no way 411
was pro phone its which borders

873
00:56:41,680 --> 00:56:45,440
phone this listen just don't be a
cheapskate

874
00:56:45,440 --> 00:56:50,119
I place at by the CD-rom subtext
twenties I don't think the point is why

875
00:56:50,119 --> 00:56:53,380
they removed it has hey we want people
to pay for it back

876
00:56:53,380 --> 00:56:59,609
sure that's what there had to be some
function of the software

877
00:56:59,609 --> 00:57:03,119
that that you couldn't get for free on
the web

878
00:57:03,119 --> 00:57:07,089
to justify going out that spending on 29
box and

879
00:57:07,089 --> 00:57:10,230
I don't think that's necessary evil
corporate but

880
00:57:10,230 --> 00:57:13,279
if I've spent a gazillion dollars
putting together this product

881
