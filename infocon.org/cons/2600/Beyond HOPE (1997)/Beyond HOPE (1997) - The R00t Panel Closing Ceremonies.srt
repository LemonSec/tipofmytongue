1
00:00:16,349 --> 00:00:23,349
kick

2
00:00:24,679 --> 00:00:25,140
and wire

3
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:30,250
hey what's up

4
00:00:30,250 --> 00:00:33,590
this is a rip at all

5
00:00:33,590 --> 00:00:38,710
only for 27 here my to the law

6
00:00:38,710 --> 00:00:41,860
seems to think that I should you wanna
see weeds

7
00:00:41,860 --> 00:00:45,170
but is gonna happen since mostly

8
00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:49,920
here dispels well

9
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:56,160
well well people at the law the people
at CDC rock various operating systems

10
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:59,489
we give that a try with with our

11
00:00:59,489 --> 00:01:04,920
OS you probably never heard about it
that's for very good reason speakers

12
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:10,390
it didn't get very far instead

13
00:01:10,390 --> 00:01:13,429
what we a router doing is on the socks
or

14
00:01:13,429 --> 00:01:18,440
unusual step because it's cases the

15
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:21,740
North boys overstepping

16
00:01:21,740 --> 00:01:24,908
the South boys firearms issue

17
00:01:24,909 --> 00:01:30,909
me Creek moving up here in 0

18
00:01:30,909 --> 00:01:36,469
okay no real name with you

19
00:01:36,469 --> 00:01:40,840
well yeah I'm I'm Rs and we've come to
the conclusion over the course of this

20
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:42,049
show unfortunately

21
00:01:42,049 --> 00:01:45,360
don't happen because New York City laws
show you but become

22
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:48,649
to the conclusion over the course this
law that we're going to go ahead and

23
00:01:48,649 --> 00:01:49,270
doors

24
00:01:49,270 --> 00:01:52,658
sector 29 as the official handgun

25
00:01:52,659 --> 00:01:56,039
and that was

26
00:01:56,039 --> 00:02:00,850
thats really although I I have to say
this is entropy and he's asleep

27
00:02:00,850 --> 00:02:04,859
as low-key basically when anyone

28
00:02:04,859 --> 00:02:10,190
to styles route is about three to four
years old

29
00:02:10,190 --> 00:02:16,430
originally stars Joe what do you mean
originally started hits

30
00:02:16,430 --> 00:02:20,329
still should be a joke granted now a
twenty-seven members france

31
00:02:20,329 --> 00:02:24,560
posture country collectively we are
technically

32
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:28,370
really we own every %uh

33
00:02:28,370 --> 00:02:33,840
we need to discuss because we found
federal agencies taking it seriously

34
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:36,070
when I told her soccer

35
00:02:36,070 --> 00:02:39,138
I saw coca-cola squirting out those
really

36
00:02:39,139 --> 00:02:44,530
right at some federal agencies

37
00:02:44,530 --> 00:02:47,739
users we just tell those rumors because

38
00:02:47,739 --> 00:02:52,560
we don't do anything malicious need this
opportunity tell everyone do anything

39
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:55,620
here we'll period me

40
00:02:55,620 --> 00:03:01,350
we don't do anything

41
00:03:01,350 --> 00:03:05,799
by means cross-country I'm sure that I
understand why some

42
00:03:05,799 --> 00:03:11,100
we r evil or so to speak

43
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:14,500
we try to do as much good as possible
our membership includes

44
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:19,160
the editors of rack magazine is pretty
widespread

45
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:22,320
this is Moses elders we

46
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:25,810
don't wanna be arrested by the feds
two-step not a good thing

47
00:03:25,810 --> 00:03:29,970
it's not just that we don't do anything
with that

48
00:03:29,970 --> 00:03:35,760
me we we have a lot of pipes in in the
works which is like a lot of space will

49
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:36,840
have a new york space

50
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:40,799
anyone's been not which is hopes by six
hundred

51
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:45,410
so long city but the route space will
eventually have enough servers

52
00:03:45,410 --> 00:03:51,410
anybody time show just come and say hey
a two-run products server web server

53
00:03:51,410 --> 00:03:55,370

54
00:03:55,370 --> 00:03:58,910
a full toward I was

55
00:03:58,910 --> 00:04:03,090
our website is up always has been up

56
00:04:03,090 --> 00:04:06,139
just that we had some difficulties with
the internet that simply

57
00:04:06,139 --> 00:04:09,630
but you'll find that be archives
actually

58
00:04:09,630 --> 00:04:16,630
much even in some way or cash on that so

59
00:04:17,350 --> 00:04:21,100
Pfizer it's just going to be all

I love you to give you a penny in for a
real soon now going out biggest art

62
00:04:29,669 --> 00:04:33,289
anything you can pick up granite were
mostly UNIX

63
00:04:33,290 --> 00:04:37,400

while that's what's

64
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:44,400
his loss K

65
00:05:14,870 --> 00:05:17,200
we just need really the opportunity to
sponsor

66
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:21,350
spares you have no idea what it's like
to be kinda freaked out and

67
00:05:21,350 --> 00:05:24,500
have potential to be treated by that one
day

68
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:27,540
I actually we will be happy

69
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:30,970
first its credibility has for

70
00:05:30,970 --> 00:05:34,190
heard a rumor it's a bit like a slight
to people

71

if you are and what you said hey that's
a little like organized

75
00:05:48,590 --> 00:05:52,460

like

102
00:07:28,660 --> 00:07:32,090
its it's just environment where

103
00:07:32,090 --> 00:07:35,260
these also smash skip

104
00:07:35,260 --> 00:07:39,730
that just

105
00:07:39,730 --> 00:07:45,640
so we really don't anticipate there'd be
any questions

106
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:49,340
we'd like to for questions just with
just one more thing

speak

111
00:08:00,870 --> 00:08:05,170
its its it's one thing started before
five kids

112
00:08:05,170 --> 00:08:08,790
local area I mean once you start gather
attention

113
00:08:08,790 --> 00:08:14,850
it doesn't become that funny a lot of
responsibility penniless fan mail

114
00:08:14,850 --> 00:08:18,400
I mean I'm see 26 week mass on a lot

120
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:42,160
group it's just a bunch of guys having
fun

121
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:45,709
that's all it is what should I start
taking a little bitty seriously

122
00:08:45,710 --> 00:08:50,610
you gonna find yourself in a whole world
champ use I would say that given the

123
00:08:50,610 --> 00:08:53,400
amount of stuff outside

124
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:56,480
sitting around grousing about interdict

125
00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:00,520
get any Tiger I mean

126
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:03,520
it's just its really where you should be
aware

127
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:06,610
so we have a question front row year

128
00:09:06,610 --> 00:09:10,830
I'm actually going to be really
residents both

129
00:09:10,830 --> 00:09:14,350
own

130
00:09:14,350 --> 00:09:18,630
okay you clarified

131
00:09:18,630 --> 00:09:22,710
your statement that you said before we
own you

132
00:09:22,710 --> 00:09:26,710
what's your own and specifically in hell
do you own okay

133
00:09:26,710 --> 00:09:30,010
three years ago we r the mantra is

134
00:09:30,010 --> 00:09:33,870
that we only look stupid because we
choose acts PS

135
00:09:33,870 --> 00:09:37,350
and there is sorta said

136
00:09:37,350 --> 00:09:40,600
that justices they're sort sent churches

137
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:46,760
geniuses only as a way of life owning

138
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:52,310
historically owning the pride of
ownership

139
00:09:52,310 --> 00:09:55,640
exact much being able to break into
machine and Tony

140
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:59,900
group or de niro

141
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:03,510
certain core routers at

142
00:10:03,510 --> 00:10:07,339
owning has changed from marks it's now
week

143
00:10:07,339 --> 00:10:10,470
me you'd be surprised how many kids just
go out towards the cons

144
00:10:10,470 --> 00:10:13,839
just said would be so afraid years

145
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:17,959
they want the pic like destroyed what we
not like that we're switching

146
00:10:17,959 --> 00:10:21,160
guys that get too drunk and seven
creates

147
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:24,400
that exactly mean it is really

148
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:27,610
grant collectively we kid if we want to
yeah

149
00:10:27,610 --> 00:10:31,850
we could public to its

150
00:10:31,850 --> 00:10:35,470
to pick up her ass actually wanted to do
something with the cause mass

151
00:10:35,470 --> 00:10:39,910
twice them spread across country were
large some large companies

152
00:10:39,910 --> 00:10:43,949
because it's a Trestman at the same time

153
00:10:43,950 --> 00:10:49,570
Rossi like in all in her mid-twenties we
have these in South joslin not about the

154
00:10:49,570 --> 00:10:50,020
risk

155
00:10:50,020 --> 00:10:53,680
or federal present so

156
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:57,200
in in summary video news but sasser's

157
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:01,110
a facetious on slogan really doesn't
have much

that much these and second

187
00:12:44,690 --> 00:12:48,480
it almost sounds like these are

188
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:52,320
with you talking about and I have no
idea really what these things are

189
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:56,459
that's good possible to to be done it's
almost

190
00:12:56,459 --> 00:13:00,450
like are that something happened

191
00:13:00,450 --> 00:13:03,530
nobody did it let's find somebody to
blame I don't know

192
00:13:03,530 --> 00:13:08,689
this sort of thing that you talk

193
00:13:08,690 --> 00:13:12,410
we we are categorically deny it anything
morally

194
00:13:12,410 --> 00:13:15,760
jaywalking phones across street over
here are

195
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:19,100
the simple fact matters the most of

196
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:23,839
don't have time ball

197
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:27,160
it was legal yeah

198
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:31,300
if we want to be actually but do we
conscious decision

199
00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:36,420
not week we find ourselves in a curious
situation

200
00:13:36,420 --> 00:13:39,640
wearing we're were actually more stop

201
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:42,970
actually really happens ends up being
attributed to its

202
00:13:42,970 --> 00:13:46,200
I have newfound respect for the

203
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:49,400
jewish bankers in the Masons and not

talk about

206
00:13:57,579 --> 00:14:01,279
thats on say the week

207
00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:04,310
in that's not to say that we deny
categorically

208
00:14:04,310 --> 00:14:07,310
we own the world in some stores
spiritual sense

209
00:14:07,310 --> 00:14:10,910
and we where actually controlling some
fight scenes but we're not doing

210
00:14:10,910 --> 00:14:11,839
anything illegal

211
00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:16,040

218
00:14:39,779 --> 00:14:42,899
is just get the heat of you

219
00:14:42,899 --> 00:14:47,279
that don't have any use for said the use

220
00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:51,000
just that we can afford

221
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,550
to have easily elected is achieved

222
00:14:54,550 --> 00:14:57,640
a granite we did something most

223
00:14:57,640 --> 00:15:01,149
to it because we have no possible

224
00:15:01,149 --> 00:15:06,019
legal but we just it's on to a friend
machinists as a practical joke

225
00:15:06,019 --> 00:15:09,680
yeah just a prank chip but yeppers

226
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:13,709
should should tribute to some within do

227
00:15:13,709 --> 00:15:16,880
we've got to the point where our
membership

228
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:20,070
in the SoCal

229
00:15:20,070 --> 00:15:25,680
are pretty much the elites said

230
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:30,190
Sony doesn't like to admit to it but
truth of the matter is

231
00:15:30,190 --> 00:15:33,649
all twenty-some have have always been

232
00:15:33,649 --> 00:15:40,190
pretty much right way I see it you guys
are

233
00:15:40,190 --> 00:15:43,290
are three-year are actually for on-site
guys sleep

234
00:15:43,290 --> 00:15:47,839
%uh to a whole bunch up people months
the computer

235
00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:51,699
Technical Community you guys happen to
be well respected because you have a

236
00:15:51,699 --> 00:15:52,170
very

237
00:15:52,170 --> 00:15:55,170
tensely high degree of technical skill
nice

238
00:15:55,170 --> 00:15:58,240
that very fundamental to the

239
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:01,540
core operations have internet
telecommunications et cetera so

240
00:16:01,540 --> 00:16:05,370
for that you have a well deserved
respect in this family a lot of people

241
00:16:05,370 --> 00:16:07,029
in this room in a lot of people

242
00:16:07,029 --> 00:16:10,990
one soon be you or at your skill and
therefore

243
00:16:10,990 --> 00:16:14,290
with all the disinformation and that
kinda sheik

244
00:16:14,290 --> 00:16:18,219
a glorification of bad boys like Wired
Magazine

245
00:16:18,220 --> 00:16:22,010
pumps out to the coca-cola job holla
consuming public or whatever

246
00:16:22,010 --> 00:16:26,029
eg and movies like hackers away
glorifies is that is probably lotta

247
00:16:26,029 --> 00:16:27,560
wannabes who found that

248
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:32,529
a the bug in the NT Ethernet card or
whatever and got in the back door and

249
00:16:32,529 --> 00:16:33,939
put your logo on the site

250
00:16:33,940 --> 00:16:37,000
because we're rootin

251
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:42,069
the may be wired magazine or printed
test well I see is basically is that

252
00:16:42,069 --> 00:16:46,060
that there's a lot of perhaps wannabes
posing giving you guys

253
00:16:46,060 --> 00:16:49,149
credit because they think its cool and
you go

254
00:16:49,149 --> 00:16:53,360
and a it's unfortunate that people are

255
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:57,240
misbehaving that way and you have to
take the is is that a fair assumption

256
00:16:57,240 --> 00:17:00,630
100 can speak no no I'm just nervous you
know i i

257
00:17:00,630 --> 00:17:05,339
I personally like how I agree with I
Mounties does track you're likely to end

258
00:17:05,339 --> 00:17:06,839
up drafted as three spokes

259
00:17:06,839 --> 00:17:10,819
say what you have my way I'm a very good
medium for me

260
00:17:10,819 --> 00:17:14,069
your lead but you've done a better job
cat

261
00:17:14,069 --> 00:17:17,168
explain this than we ever thank you
thank you later

262
00:17:17,169 --> 00:17:21,750
but know by anyway I just wanna say that
having never seen you guys in knowing

263
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:23,280
can do behind-the-scenes

264
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:27,970
I just want to give you my greatest
aberration because what you do makes

265
00:17:27,970 --> 00:17:31,100
what I impossible not having your level
of skill

266
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:35,350
and if you ever find yourselves perhaps
in a position where

267
00:17:35,350 --> 00:17:39,389
where I can employ you I'm very happy to
do so let's have a round of applause

268
00:17:39,390 --> 00:17:43,550
these guys and stop these abortion
portion

269
00:17:43,550 --> 00:17:48,210
lynching and you know it anything that
they have to share I came here to see

270
00:17:48,210 --> 00:17:48,990
here

271
00:17:48,990 --> 00:17:52,640
what I can learn from these guys not not
this in your hand and

272
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:55,990
look at them %uh at the Nuremberg
process have you been drinking tonight

273
00:17:55,990 --> 00:17:59,419
not at all I like this start you very
much very much

274
00:17:59,419 --> 00:18:03,559
said exactly what I wanted them me so I
went on asking you guys now is

275
00:18:03,559 --> 00:18:06,799
if this does anything in lightning
technically that which

276
00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:10,059
know like new things or whatever share
your knowledge on that level and stop

277
00:18:10,059 --> 00:18:10,908
defending yourself

278
00:18:10,909 --> 00:18:14,280
don't apologize for what you're great at
doing and

279
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:17,290
I really wanna from Bradley also we we

280
00:18:17,290 --> 00:18:23,460
at the smaller Hans %uh we with ties
have all 27 us

281
00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:28,200
as many bus there are on usually ap
members I get up on a panel let

282
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:32,000
audience pick their brains

283
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,800
as I think it's really well done rather
hear some guys apologizing man

284
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:38,889
you know let's have a look you know a
bug festival

285
00:18:38,890 --> 00:18:42,990
man like you know flow into a fuck fest
like for a weekend or something and

286
00:18:42,990 --> 00:18:44,730
bring all you guys down and you can just

287
00:18:44,730 --> 00:18:48,990
tell what people need to do to fix that
that's that's kinda like to see the

288
00:18:48,990 --> 00:18:49,390
perks

289
00:18:49,390 --> 00:18:52,450
he's the do that and

290
00:18:52,450 --> 00:18:58,350
yes so that the moment we start talking
about bugs I want to mention

291
00:18:58,350 --> 00:19:05,010
any particular by unity if the moment we
do that is a moment resort our time

292
00:19:05,010 --> 00:19:05,850
defeat the purpose

293
00:19:05,850 --> 00:19:09,230
say that we are not responsible great
yeah

294
00:19:09,230 --> 00:19:13,700
obviously knows we went through
collectively is mostly like

295
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:18,059
attack reforms of course I think that
that this is the essence of it

296
00:19:18,059 --> 00:19:23,450
and then again I mean if I by after like
72 hours it is conference

297
00:19:23,450 --> 00:19:26,830
people here haven't gotten the the
message that criminal hacking

298
00:19:26,830 --> 00:19:30,399
is exactly that in fact it's not even

299
00:19:30,399 --> 00:19:34,860
hacking its criminal its if it's done
such forget it now we know this already

300
00:19:34,860 --> 00:19:38,820
now let's go on it looks like I'll got
to take it one step beyond that it's

301
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:39,510
clear to me

302
00:19:39,510 --> 00:19:43,570
case funny anymore it's not on breaking
into a website

303
00:19:43,570 --> 00:19:46,980
and changing the contents of it was
funny

304
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:50,870
sort of the year and a half ago when it
first happened maybe two years ago

305
00:19:50,870 --> 00:19:54,850
and it's turned into the same joke being
told over and over and over again

306
00:19:54,850 --> 00:19:59,419
and I wouldn't waste my time doing know
it's all die I would rather hear like

307
00:19:59,419 --> 00:20:00,820
the kinda constructive step

308
00:20:00,820 --> 00:20:04,600
guys are good at doing you want
everything to me she by yourselves

309
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:08,030
last run caps bring yourself there's no
reason

310
00:20:08,030 --> 00:20:12,510
touch say you want it up here and
actually give you information about bugs

311
00:20:12,510 --> 00:20:13,429
and exploits

312
00:20:13,429 --> 00:20:16,980
out actually counterproductive for us
because our last

313
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:20,780
to say that I i'm I'm saying you know
I'm not asking you to do

314
00:20:20,780 --> 00:20:24,800
holds like out understand

315
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:28,500
the even speaking about that kind
against

316
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:32,030
point we're trying to make which is
group basically

317
00:20:32,030 --> 00:20:35,200
about you guys to get together hang out

318
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:39,860
and don't do anything so coming up here
talking but experts up

319
00:20:39,860 --> 00:20:43,340
be we've done in the past

320
00:20:43,340 --> 00:20:46,870
just just not hope is not for

321
00:20:46,870 --> 00:20:52,110
because

322
00:20:52,110 --> 00:20:55,470
I don't think the time a grand I'm sure

323
00:20:55,470 --> 00:20:58,850
on 101 now but

324
00:20:58,850 --> 00:21:04,080
reform no I'm talking more routine stuff
you know guys like you know how to keep

325
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:05,580
a network really running

326
00:21:05,580 --> 00:21:09,139
help people here have a knowledge to do
that it's not about breaking things

327
00:21:09,140 --> 00:21:10,320
anyways about running

328
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:15,580
the right was not even now would you
agree I would say that in my opinion

329
00:21:15,580 --> 00:21:19,320
years after the show will I explain our
rate schedule

330
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:24,830
okay thanks a lot other other way

331
00:21:24,830 --> 00:21:29,340
hi %uh you guys claim that you don't do
anything

332
00:21:29,340 --> 00:21:32,800
you yet you get a lot of credit for
doing something

333
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:36,440
won a few appears to be asleep have any
you considered a career in law

334
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:38,500
enforcement

335
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:43,690
the fact crosses my mind

336
00:21:43,690 --> 00:21:47,120
time to time these are actually played
by

337
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:51,200
BR the Internet is actually a lot more
lucrative place to make one's

338
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:56,040
living these days if they start paying
150 dollar an hour

339
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:59,678
consulting fees I'm there I mean

340
00:21:59,679 --> 00:22:03,480
we're not kids eventually I see a lot of
young pacer

341
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:07,070
grow up lot of money a member

342
00:22:07,070 --> 00:22:11,870
youngest members eighty

343
00:22:11,870 --> 00:22:15,000
his kids are making six figures brown
I'm

344
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:18,250
all is like our own before it is

345
00:22:18,250 --> 00:22:22,830
most must rely on each other part berkes
we can forget someone else

346
00:22:22,830 --> 00:22:27,389
so it's a collective you think that

347
00:22:27,389 --> 00:22:30,710
that kinda easy someone like this car

348
00:22:30,710 --> 00:22:34,409
we're not 3 legal there so when you get
to a position

349
00:22:34,409 --> 00:22:38,100
when you're playing for a lot of stuff
then search answers

350
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:41,159
I take your type person never been
rescued

351
00:22:41,159 --> 00:22:45,250
another I am I thank God this

352
00:22:45,250 --> 00:22:51,230
but the moment people start talking
about virtual out

353
00:22:51,230 --> 00:22:56,360
second to time in your life

354
00:22:56,360 --> 00:23:00,530
you go to const you're worried about him
I can be fussy for something I'd even

355
00:23:00,530 --> 00:23:03,970
hey do yeah my were

356
00:23:03,970 --> 00:23:07,200
I we're about associating with people
because I don't know what they do in

357
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:08,540
their free time

358
00:23:08,540 --> 00:23:12,440
such and

359
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:16,429
that's pretty much how and I need this
for renews

360
00:23:16,429 --> 00:23:19,600
12 much just the whole losers because

361
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:25,260
as much as hell live music as people
think yeah it's called

362
00:23:25,260 --> 00:23:29,450
school addition for but

363
00:23:29,450 --> 00:23:33,020
these people are eventually gonna go out
to the job market find

364
00:23:33,020 --> 00:23:36,060
I kept ok to my job

365
00:23:36,060 --> 00:23:40,000
and there are issues that technical
skill to do their job very well

366
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:43,159
and when there at that point where all
this are

367
00:23:43,159 --> 00:23:46,740
not one anything tell you just because
you have a sec

368
00:23:46,740 --> 00:23:50,070
Association to you group of people who
are generally

369
00:23:50,070 --> 00:23:53,678
accepted as hackers who are just
completely me

370
00:23:53,679 --> 00:23:57,149
skill just for that Association you want
to be

371
00:23:57,149 --> 00:24:03,470
thought some people happy because people
his constant

372
00:24:03,470 --> 00:24:06,649
you want its some

373
00:24:06,649 --> 00:24:10,659
2012 way

374
00:24:10,659 --> 00:24:13,830
that's actually why top yeah some

375
00:24:13,830 --> 00:24:18,210
country where that's really you guys
went up there said

376
00:24:18,210 --> 00:24:21,429
whatever whatever you wanna match wits
with be fine go ahead

377
00:24:21,429 --> 00:24:25,129
mesh that's perfectly fine but the point
is

378
00:24:25,129 --> 00:24:29,220
I've got a life I've got my check skills

379
00:24:29,220 --> 00:24:32,760
and I have over to france we share
technical and just

380
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:35,929
you know personal ish and mission fall

381
00:24:35,929 --> 00:24:39,240
like people have to

382
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:42,330
now but

383
00:24:42,330 --> 00:24:49,330
that's pretty much it

384
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:55,490
i'ma leave give me where's are

385
00:24:55,490 --> 00:24:58,809
where c1 where's us where's I

386
00:24:58,809 --> 00:25:03,658
the other in the wares house

387
00:25:03,659 --> 00:25:07,049
the check is in the mail

388
00:25:07,049 --> 00:25:10,559
that is much some ish

389
00:25:10,559 --> 00:25:13,860
and I i think we might say in summary

390
00:25:13,860 --> 00:25:17,150
we only look stupid because

391
00:25:17,150 --> 00:25:24,150
we choose Daxter yes

392
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:28,200
%uh ok I

393
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:32,540
don't know nothing Oman knowing nothing
is great but

394
00:25:32,540 --> 00:25:39,540
okay I've heard doing nothing gets
plausible deniability

395
00:25:40,380 --> 00:25:43,429
first said into port dotnet so maybe

396
00:25:43,429 --> 00:25:47,080
cats here continued conversation

397
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:50,189
email my next 3 p.s

398
00:25:50,190 --> 00:25:55,140
the or something like that anyway and
other slacker nice

399
00:25:55,140 --> 00:25:58,559
some working I'm running Windows 95 in
mice

400
00:25:58,559 --> 00:26:02,019
everyone said about my sound card that
is and then

401
00:26:02,019 --> 00:26:05,019
the that isn't playing music and i wanna
do

402
00:26:05,019 --> 00:26:10,610
retail and stuff all would and Linux and
what flavor should I try n

403
00:26:10,610 --> 00:26:13,960
learner run I've no actually

404
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:18,169
I think a short say if you want a free

405
00:26:18,169 --> 00:26:23,139
UNIX on your PC almost up here would
recommend OpenBSD

406
00:26:23,139 --> 00:26:26,470
appear to rate who also is that's very
was the author

407
00:26:26,470 --> 00:26:29,600
is has close ties what

408
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:34,000
speak BR the opinion on Linux is

409
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:37,899
its software written by rank amateurs
for Ag amateurs

410
00:26:37,899 --> 00:26:41,500
spend about walking around sign facts as
hack

411
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:45,740
limits really just as hell have any
respect my if you want to learn a good

412
00:26:45,740 --> 00:26:47,909
UNIX we recommend OpenBSD

413
00:26:47,909 --> 00:26:52,830
I because I feel uses a solid I

414
00:26:52,830 --> 00:26:56,500
however for a beginner really doesn't
have a lot of these experience

415
00:26:56,500 --> 00:26:59,559
I would personally recommend previous
because there's

416
00:26:59,559 --> 00:27:03,570
so much support for I also extremely
easy to install

417

up and running I is it downloaded 3

418

851
00:58:25,119 --> 00:58:29,180

fun and not work

860
00:59:06,489 --> 00:59:10,660
asking a lot of people including British
people on people that were visiting us

861
00:59:10,660 --> 00:59:15,359
people from other States they all spent
hours trying to figure it out

862
00:59:15,359 --> 00:59:18,459
they didn't do it or have a contest for
that afterwards then

863
00:59:18,459 --> 00:59:22,880
we need to make this go quickly on porch
up hold up something

864
00:59:22,880 --> 00:59:26,869
I this was donated by Bernie s

865
00:59:26,869 --> 00:59:32,949
its is a or maybe you can explain it
your

866
00:59:32,949 --> 00:59:36,449
three years ago it hope 94 I

867
00:59:36,449 --> 00:59:39,680
demonstrated to to clipper chip in
Christian

868
00:59:39,680 --> 00:59:44,209
systems I he found out they weren't the
greatest thing since sliced bread

869
00:59:44,209 --> 00:59:48,170
because the NSA had a back door to the
year getting corruption scheme

870
00:59:48,170 --> 00:59:51,549
but added algorithm but highly doubt

871
00:59:51,549 --> 00:59:55,019
over two thousand dollars for those two
things to test them out and

872
00:59:55,019 --> 00:59:59,769
I sometime after that the secret service
rate at my house and

873
00:59:59,769 --> 01:00:03,249
took a whole bunch of shit from me and
it took

874
01:00:03,249 --> 01:00:06,299
one up the two clipper chip in
corruption unit I don't know why didn't

875
01:00:06,299 --> 01:00:07,279
take about but

876
01:00:07,279 --> 01:00:10,699
I they left me with one and

877
01:00:10,699 --> 01:00:14,099
while the box is a little mill do it
because they put it in storage where was

878
01:00:14,099 --> 01:00:14,529
a

879
01:00:14,529 --> 01:00:18,599
not best for electronic equipment on

880
01:00:18,599 --> 01:00:22,890
I did get it back and inside its
Christina still wrapped in plastic

881
01:00:22,890 --> 01:00:26,589
it's an eleven hundred dollar speech
encryption unit that you can use to

882
01:00:26,589 --> 01:00:27,940
speak to anybody else

883
01:00:27,940 --> 01:00:32,769
it's always a call unit and that works
on all phones and it's really cool and

884
01:00:32,769 --> 01:00:37,339
we're gonna give this away okay the this
is gonna be a surprise

885
01:00:37,339 --> 01:00:42,430
for anybody who um has this badge
numbers everybody should look at their

886
01:00:42,430 --> 01:00:43,589
badges

887
01:00:43,589 --> 01:00:47,269
know your number cuz that's the way
there were gonna do this and we just

888
01:00:47,269 --> 01:00:48,410
decided now

889
01:00:48,410 --> 01:00:52,848
okay the middle four digits there two
digits

890
01:00:52,849 --> 01:00:56,779
but started then therefore in the middle
then there are two digits that ended

891
01:00:56,779 --> 01:00:59,959
this is a clue a pretty big blue

892
01:00:59,959 --> 01:01:04,809
it's a really big clear I'm not taking
volunteers for my contest you can answer

CNN I'm gonna read out a number

895
01:01:08,640 --> 01:01:12,379

bad

896
01:01:12,380 --> 01:01:18,269
art 2600 you can have that as long as
you live within the United States

897
01:01:18,269 --> 01:01:21,900
I this is not exportable it is a
munition

898
01:01:21,900 --> 01:01:26,349
okay we tried to give it to the guy who
hacked crude

899
01:01:26,349 --> 01:01:30,369
there's Canada he was from Canada and
needed to take it on a bus

900
01:01:30,369 --> 01:01:34,440
lol he wanted other stuff anyway what
you didn't want anything

901
01:01:34,440 --> 01:01:38,789

the room have a badge with that number

902
01:01:38,789 --> 01:01:43,539

908
01:02:03,660 --> 01:02:07,038

01:02:49,890 --> 01:02:55,078
to good the AHSAA one in 10,000 that
they would have the console
