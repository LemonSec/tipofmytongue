<font color="#E5E5E5">so your brain puts out electrical</font>

60
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:13,720
signals which is basically the

difference in ionic charge with sodium

62

graphic the electrode translates the

signal or the charge

65
00:03:23,799 --> 00:03:29,650
how does the brain<font color="#E5E5E5"> turn thoughts into</font>

66
00:03:26,170 --> 00:03:33,010
action well your neurons get a charge

about two hundred fiftieth of a second

69
00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:40,030
i'm not going into the science of it

70
00:03:38,410 --> 00:03:44,140
because that's not what this is about

that come into your brain and the signal

76
00:03:58,390 --> 00:04:04,208
has to be smooth through an algorithm

77
00:04:00,579 --> 00:04:08,260
and the algorithms are varied and have

78
00:04:04,209 --> 00:04:10,690
different degrees of efficacy<font color="#CCCCCC"> there's</font>

79
00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:13,230
more machine learning now and algorithms

80
00:04:10,690 --> 00:04:15,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">this is what's known as the basic tent</font>

it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in a lot of you will love this</font>

87
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:37,080
because it's about signal acquisition

88
00:04:32,669 --> 00:04:40,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">you digitize the signal you processor</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">you translated you give it a command and</font>

90

this you have the<font color="#CCCCCC"> BCI application</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and I</font>

91
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:48,719
think that's pretty true of a lot of

signal processing but in this case<font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font>

you get<font color="#E5E5E5"> is you get things like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you can</font>

and with your own concentration you lift

266
00:14:08,060 --> 00:14:12,680
up in the harness and if you lose

267
00:14:10,310 --> 00:14:16,729
concentration you lower but if you keep

268
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:21,109
concentration you lift up 30 feet and uh

then this will be connected to my head

339

00:34:38,810 --> 00:34:45,168
your brain is<font color="#E5E5E5"> organized and it into</font>

categories that at this point through an

you're someone<font color="#E5E5E5"> in your dreaming and</font>

726
00:34:54,109 --> 00:34:58,940
you're in a situation where it can be

<font color="#E5E5E5">subtracted people can tell what you're</font>

729
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:07,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">was going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to take a lot more research or</font>

730
00:35:05,270 --> 00:35:11,150
if you're thinking of something<font color="#E5E5E5"> or being</font>

731
00:35:07,580 --> 00:35:13,700
shown something you cannot<font color="#E5E5E5"> fake that you</font>

recognize it or don't recognize it<font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font>

733
00:35:13,700 --> 00:35:19,460
that's the state and now there's

734
00:35:16,369 --> 00:35:22,910
something called optogenetics<font color="#E5E5E5"> in which</font>

735
00:35:19,460 --> 00:35:25,850
false memories can be implanted and they

736
00:35:22,910 --> 00:35:29,839
are being implanted into mice<font color="#E5E5E5"> opto</font>

737
00:35:25,850 --> 00:35:32,029
genetics is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a science of light and it's</font>

738
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:36,050
a very recent science and only came out

739
00:35:32,030 --> 00:35:38,840
in 2011 and basically how it works<font color="#E5E5E5"> is it</font>

740
00:35:36,050 --> 00:35:42,680
takes light-sensitive protein from algae

741
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:45,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">put it into DNA in specific neurons in</font>

742
00:35:42,680 --> 00:35:48,348
the brain and transplants it

743
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:50,900
right now it turns on and off with

744
00:35:48,349 --> 00:35:54,890
special light that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> blue turns it on</font>

745
00:35:50,900 --> 00:35:58,849
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> read turns it off so what that means</font>

746
00:35:54,890 --> 00:36:01,400
is you could have a mouse<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you could</font>

747
00:35:58,849 --> 00:36:04,790
have a happy Mouse and then you<font color="#E5E5E5"> shocked</font>

748
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:06,680
it in<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it's in a box and you take it</font>

749
00:36:04,790 --> 00:36:08,480
out of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> box and you opto genetically</font>

750
00:36:06,680 --> 00:36:12,200
manipulated and you take it out of the

751
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:13,880
box and put<font color="#E5E5E5"> it in in a grassy field and</font>

752
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:16,009
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> mouse is running around the grassy</font>

753
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:18,710
field<font color="#E5E5E5"> you turn the blue light on it and</font>

754
00:36:16,010 --> 00:36:21,890
the mouse goes into shock<font color="#E5E5E5"> because it</font>

755
00:36:18,710 --> 00:36:24,319
thinks<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's back in the Box</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> getting the</font>

756
00:36:21,890 --> 00:36:26,240
shock but actually nothing's happening

757
00:36:24,319 --> 00:36:28,640
<font color="#CCCCCC">it's running around in the grassy field</font>

758
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:32,990
so a false memory has been implanted

759
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:35,390
into the mouse and been turned on<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

760
00:36:32,990 --> 00:36:37,520
is an experimental stage right now it

761
00:36:35,390 --> 00:36:42,078
takes a lot of on genetic manipulation

762
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:45,440
but it works the other<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing that's</font>

763
00:36:42,079 --> 00:36:47,510
going on is DARPA is developing

764
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:49,880
something called the cortical modem and

765
00:36:47,510 --> 00:36:52,160
the cortical modem will be the size of a

766
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:55,190
nickel and it will be implanted right

767
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:57,500
into your brain<font color="#E5E5E5"> giving you images</font>

768
00:36:55,190 --> 00:37:00,260
directly into the brain with no other

769
00:36:57,500 --> 00:37:02,329
interface<font color="#E5E5E5"> right now it's being used in</font>

770
00:37:00,260 --> 00:37:04,430
zebrafish because again it's another

771
00:37:02,329 --> 00:37:06,650
genetic situation it's being used

772
00:37:04,430 --> 00:37:09,919
because they think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that will be a good</font>

773
00:37:06,650 --> 00:37:12,589
way for soldiers to communicate from

774
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:14,930
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> brain-to-brain</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and that's why it's</font>

775
00:37:12,589 --> 00:37:16,819
being developed now<font color="#CCCCCC"> I found out about</font>

776
00:37:14,930 --> 00:37:19,549
this and<font color="#E5E5E5"> DARPA had a conference in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> New</font>

777
00:37:16,819 --> 00:37:22,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">York last year and they wanted people to</font>

778
00:37:19,549 --> 00:37:23,930
reach out and do something so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I thought</font>

779
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:26,660
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay I'll reach out and do something so</font>

780
00:37:23,930 --> 00:37:29,509
<font color="#CCCCCC">i wrote</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to them i said hi</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> dirt</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

781
00:37:26,660 --> 00:37:32,299
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to come to your conference and they</font>

782
00:37:29,510 --> 00:37:34,369
were like<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah sure will</font>

783
00:37:32,299 --> 00:37:36,589
<font color="#E5E5E5">and here's the email</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i got and they said</font>

784
00:37:34,369 --> 00:37:37,579
<font color="#E5E5E5">i will forward your email never heard</font>

785
00:37:36,589 --> 00:37:40,640
from them again

786
00:37:37,579 --> 00:37:42,559
<font color="#CCCCCC">ok but i did reach out just like they</font>

787
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:44,240
wanted you to<font color="#E5E5E5"> write</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i said i want to see</font>

788
00:37:42,559 --> 00:37:50,059
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> cortical modem</font>

789
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:53,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">ah</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> no way right ok so then there's also</font>

790

the startup phase and are being well

to the final part of what I came here to

her brain was triggering all of that

<font color="#E5E5E5">depending on what was going on in the</font>

861
00:41:40,040 --> 00:41:44,960
story and this performance took about 20

00:41:42,620 --> 00:41:48,680
minutes no one can wear a headset much

863

longer than that<font color="#E5E5E5"> without</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> our having</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

00:41:51,860 --> 00:41:55,400
my knowledge it was the world's first

867
00:41:55,400 --> 00:42:00,230
so where does that leave us in terms of

868
00:41:58,850 --> 00:42:02,839
what's going to happen

869
00:42:00,230 --> 00:42:04,760
well there is one group that's taking

870
00:42:02,840 --> 00:42:08,870
responsibility for this

871
00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:11,570
they're called<font color="#CCCCCC"> cer e.b</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the Center for</font>

874
00:42:13,460 --> 00:42:19,340
to put out publications about the ethics

877
00:42:21,950 --> 00:42:28,939
let's hope people follow<font color="#E5E5E5"> their</font>

878
00:42:24,710 --> 00:42:31,340
instructions but in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> in terms of</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">it's an open question</font>

881
00:42:34,940 --> 00:42:45,500
so that's basically my presentation and

882
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:55,580
now questions

883
00:42:45,500 --> 00:42:58,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">they're not i have to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think about that</font>

884
00:42:55,580 --> 00:43:01,069
because a lot of this is still in a

885
00:42:58,100 --> 00:43:03,230
position for me to publish about it and

886
00:43:01,070 --> 00:43:05,810
<font color="#CCCCCC">I am publishing a lot about it in peer</font>

887
00:43:03,230 --> 00:43:10,100
review journals so that's why I'm not

888
00:43:05,810 --> 00:43:13,430
being<font color="#CCCCCC"> too</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> public about it yet that's why</font>

889
00:43:10,100 --> 00:43:16,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">but this is all information that you can</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">I personally think that the United</font>

900
00:43:41,820 --> 00:43:46,800
there's a very non public face and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

901
00:43:44,970 --> 00:43:52,459
can't penetrate it because<font color="#CCCCCC"> i don't have</font>

00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:59,030

<font color="#E5E5E5">are we from</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> did I get this right wearing</font>

906
00:44:06,080 --> 00:44:12,980
a helmet instead of a physical helmet

907
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:14,570
well basically the military that's a

908
00:44:12,980 --> 00:44:16,970
great question is designing those

909
00:44:14,570 --> 00:44:20,000
helmets and<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're designing those</font>

910
00:44:16,970 --> 00:44:21,439
helmets<font color="#E5E5E5"> already for soldiers to have</font>

911
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:25,790
direct brain-to-brain communication

912
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:28,730
which they feel will be much easier and

913
00:44:25,790 --> 00:44:30,980
much less open to misinterpretation so

914
00:44:28,730 --> 00:44:39,710
that is in the design stage<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're</font>

915
00:44:30,980 --> 00:44:43,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">you're right about that</font>

916
00:44:39,710 --> 00:44:45,290
oh that is really in the future if you

917
00:44:43,910 --> 00:44:47,180
don't have to wear a helmet to read

918
00:44:45,290 --> 00:44:49,250
someone's brain<font color="#CCCCCC"> ways but by the end of</font>

00:44:47,180 --> 00:44:50,390
these<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10-year initiatives</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> by all these</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">I don't have an answer for that it's the</font>

922
00:44:52,790 --> 00:45:04,520
the research is going very quickly

absolutely

believe in the next 10 years they will

ask those questions<font color="#CCCCCC"> so that's a great</font>
