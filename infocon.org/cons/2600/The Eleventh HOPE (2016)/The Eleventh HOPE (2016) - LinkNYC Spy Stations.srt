14
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:46,410
has been we<font color="#E5E5E5"> around the time we started</font>

15
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:49,320
seeing these<font color="#CCCCCC"> linked</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> NYC kiosks go up</font>

16
00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:51,809
around the city<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we saw some news</font>

17
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:56,070
coverage of how exciting this is

18
00:00:51,809 --> 00:01:00,239
<font color="#E5E5E5">I looked at the privacy policies that</font>

19
00:00:56,070 --> 00:01:03,059
were up and read them and the privacy

20
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:07,770
policy in the franchise agreement and

21
00:01:03,059 --> 00:01:09,840
had some concerns<font color="#CCCCCC"> so i sent a letter to</font>

22
00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:13,740
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> city outlining our concerns and</font>

23
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:15,990
recommending changes and<font color="#E5E5E5"> and are you</font>

24
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:18,419
know overall view was that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's great</font>

25
00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:21,419
that the city is working on providing

26
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:23,460
free internet access to people

27
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:24,720
internet access is a very valuable

28
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:26,399
resource

29
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:28,650
there are too many people in this city

30
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:31,259
who do not have access to that resource

31
00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:35,040
and so we support the goal of providing

32
00:01:31,259 --> 00:01:38,280
free municipal Wi-Fi access but<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the</font>

33
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:41,250

34
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:44,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">I said that letter</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i believe it was in</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">april or so to the city and a couple</font>

36
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:49,740
weeks ago there was a great Village

37

38

was an anonymous<font color="#E5E5E5"> city government</font>

43
00:02:02,610 --> 00:02:06,450
somewhat disappointed<font color="#CCCCCC"> because I thought</font>

44
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:08,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">I would learn a lot from this panel with</font>

00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:11,030
disappointed<font color="#CCCCCC"> when they asked me to be on</font>

47
00:02:10,649 --> 00:02:12,500
it

48
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:14,540
I was like<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I guess I'm not gonna</font>

00:02:42,290 --> 00:02:55,060
it over to<font color="#CCCCCC"> Benjamin now</font>

63
00:02:59,230 --> 00:03:03,190
very disappointed that they wouldn't be

64
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:07,179
speaking<font color="#CCCCCC"> but ever since i started</font>

65
00:03:03,190 --> 00:03:08,740
exploring the link NYC<font color="#CCCCCC"> project and it</font>

66
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:11,260
caught my attention maybe two years ago

67
00:03:08,740 --> 00:03:14,950
it became apparent to me immediately

68
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:18,040
that for<font color="#CCCCCC"> what's billed as a public and</font>

69
00:03:14,950 --> 00:03:21,640
free Wi-Fi service<font color="#CCCCCC"> its striking because</font>

70
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:24,970
as we know when you're not paying you're

71
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:27,279
not the customer your product but also

72
00:03:24,970 --> 00:03:30,940
that this project has been largely

73
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:34,209
<font color="#CCCCCC">privatized</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so this free public Wi-Fi</font>

74
00:03:30,940 --> 00:03:36,459
that isn't free or public is anomalous

75
00:03:34,209 --> 00:03:39,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">and interesting to explore just for that</font>

76
00:03:36,459 --> 00:03:40,930
very reason<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> introduce</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> myself very</font>

87
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:10,239
in understanding the intricacies of city

314
00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:51,839
that point<font color="#E5E5E5"> so what the company has said</font>

what the privacy policy should say<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">it's really the privacy pop policy that</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">company's to collect everything and</font>

retain everything for an indefinite

678
00:28:33,260 --> 00:28:37,550
period of time and we said that that

679
00:28:35,900 --> 00:28:39,830
that needs to be that language needs to

680
00:28:37,550 --> 00:28:41,990
be revised it needs to be tied to

681
00:28:39,830 --> 00:28:45,679
operational needs and the retention

682

a specific commitment to delete<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

certain circumstances<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the second</font>

685
00:28:50,870 --> 00:28:56,870
piece that we raised was the government

00:28:54,890 --> 00:29:01,970
acts as the possibility of government

access<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so the privacy policy is</font>

itself

694
00:29:15,620 --> 00:29:20,209

questions about<font color="#E5E5E5"> will be a subpoena will</font>

00:29:20,210 --> 00:29:27,080
be a warrant

what<font color="#E5E5E5"> what kind of order is required</font>

698
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:32,000
before<font color="#CCCCCC"> government agencies can get</font>

699
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:35,750
access to the data that these companies

700
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:38,390
are collecting and then there's a

701
00:29:35,750 --> 00:29:41,330
question about whether the users will

702
00:29:38,390 --> 00:29:44,240
get notice when a government entity

703
00:29:41,330 --> 00:29:46,639
request information from these companies

704
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:48,210
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that becomes really important</font>

705
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:50,400
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's the notice</font>

706
00:29:48,210 --> 00:29:52,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">peace that give users the right to stand</font>

00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:54,390
up for their own rights<font color="#CCCCCC"> if they don't</font>

708
00:29:52,980 --> 00:29:56,610
get noticed that a government has

709
00:29:54,390 --> 00:29:58,920
requested this information<font color="#E5E5E5"> they'll never</font>

710
00:29:56,610 --> 00:30:03,479
know they won't be able to go into court

711
00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:06,270
to move to quash the subpoena or<font color="#E5E5E5"> worn</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font>

712
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:09,030
on that<font color="#E5E5E5"> piece on the notice</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> piece the</font>

713
00:30:06,270 --> 00:30:12,840
privacy policy says and we will make

714
00:30:09,030 --> 00:30:16,530
reasonable efforts to notify you of

715
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:18,929
government requests for information<font color="#CCCCCC"> if</font>

716
00:30:16,530 --> 00:30:21,510
we can essentially<font color="#E5E5E5"> if it's possible to</font>

717
00:30:18,930 --> 00:30:26,730
the extent<font color="#E5E5E5"> as possible so we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ask that</font>

718
00:30:21,510 --> 00:30:30,150
that kind of a language<font color="#CCCCCC"> be be revised</font>

719
00:30:26,730 --> 00:30:33,930
and to actually make a commitment to

720
00:30:30,150 --> 00:30:36,630
notify users whenever they can notify

721
00:30:33,930 --> 00:30:41,820
users unless they are prohibited from

722
00:30:36,630 --> 00:30:43,530
doing so under a judicial order<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

723
00:30:41,820 --> 00:30:44,939
that's generally the framework in which

724
00:30:43,530 --> 00:30:47,370
it works

725
00:30:44,940 --> 00:30:50,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">law enforcement entities are not allowed</font>

726
00:30:47,370 --> 00:30:52,560
to gag service providers from notifying

727
00:30:50,130 --> 00:30:54,810
their users of requests for information

728
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:57,120
unless they've gotten an order from the

729
00:30:54,810 --> 00:30:59,310
judge saying but<font color="#E5E5E5"> its necessary to do so</font>

730
00:30:57,120 --> 00:31:01,379
for<font color="#CCCCCC"> a short period of time so our</font>

731
00:30:59,310 --> 00:31:04,470
recommendation was that you make a

732
00:31:01,380 --> 00:31:08,760
commitment to notify your users<font color="#E5E5E5"> whenever</font>

733
00:31:04,470 --> 00:31:10,650
you are allowed to do so and third piece

734
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:13,890
that we had questions about was the

735
00:31:10,650 --> 00:31:16,710
cameras and the environmental sensors<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

736
00:31:13,890 --> 00:31:20,670
as you saw in the privacy policy the

737
00:31:16,710 --> 00:31:22,980
policy currently says that those<font color="#E5E5E5"> fees</font>

738
00:31:20,670 --> 00:31:25,380
from the cameras can be shared with law

739
00:31:22,980 --> 00:31:27,930
enforcement and with the city<font color="#E5E5E5"> no</font>

740
00:31:25,380 --> 00:31:29,970
restrictions on that<font color="#E5E5E5"> so we wanted to</font>

741
00:31:27,930 --> 00:31:33,150
know if those fees were going to be

742
00:31:29,970 --> 00:31:37,350
aggregated into the domain awareness

743
00:31:33,150 --> 00:31:39,930
system which is the system that the NYPD

744
00:31:37,350 --> 00:31:42,090
has<font color="#E5E5E5"> set up in place that aggregates fees</font>

745
00:31:39,930 --> 00:31:43,950
from NYPD surveillance cameras

746
00:31:42,090 --> 00:31:47,879
automatically<font color="#E5E5E5"> license plate readers</font>

747
00:31:43,950 --> 00:31:51,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">they've</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> now added</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ShotSpotter data which</font>

748
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:56,460
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> God detection data and</font>

749
00:31:51,690 --> 00:31:58,769
we were concerned that all these cameras

750
00:31:56,460 --> 00:32:02,190
that are going up<font color="#E5E5E5"> are going to end up</font>

751
00:31:58,769 --> 00:32:05,610
feeding into that system as well<font color="#E5E5E5"> and and</font>

752
00:32:02,190 --> 00:32:07,679
and also the policy said that with the

753
00:32:05,610 --> 00:32:09,508
<font color="#CCCCCC">put written</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> permission of the city we</font>

754
00:32:07,679 --> 00:32:10,470
can share the camera feeds with any

755
00:32:09,509 --> 00:32:12,509
entity

756
00:32:10,470 --> 00:32:14,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">absolutely said well you know there</font>

757
00:32:12,509 --> 00:32:17,580
should be a mechanism for the public to

758
00:32:14,340 --> 00:32:19,559
know when this company has gotten

759
00:32:17,580 --> 00:32:22,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">written permission from the city to</font>

760
00:32:19,559 --> 00:32:25,980
share with a<font color="#CCCCCC"> third party company and the</font>

761
00:32:22,710 --> 00:32:27,450
response<font color="#CCCCCC"> as i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> mentioned the city is not</font>

762
00:32:25,980 --> 00:32:29,879
going to be responding to our<font color="#CCCCCC"> letter</font>

763
00:32:27,450 --> 00:32:32,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">apparently but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> uh</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the company has</font>

764
00:32:29,879 --> 00:32:34,769
responded in public statements as<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

765
00:32:32,820 --> 00:32:36,059
mentioned on the collection and

766
00:32:34,769 --> 00:32:39,690
retention<font color="#CCCCCC"> piece they said we're not</font>

767
00:32:36,059 --> 00:32:41,610
doing this right now<font color="#E5E5E5"> and also on the</font>

768
00:32:39,690 --> 00:32:44,820
camera speeds they said well the cameras

769
00:32:41,610 --> 00:32:47,340
are not currently on<font color="#E5E5E5"> but of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> course that</font>

770
00:32:44,820 --> 00:32:50,250
really begs the question of when will

771
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:53,699
they be turned on when will<font color="#E5E5E5"> we learn</font>

772
00:32:50,250 --> 00:32:56,850
about it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and when</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's turned</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on and</font>

773
00:32:53,700 --> 00:32:59,610
what will we learn about how those

774
00:32:56,850 --> 00:33:02,668
cameras<font color="#CCCCCC"> how all of this data is going to</font>

775
00:32:59,610 --> 00:33:06,299
be used and that goes back to the need

776
00:33:02,669 --> 00:33:09,120
to have<font color="#E5E5E5"> very much more specific</font>

777
00:33:06,299 --> 00:33:10,769
privacy policy<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I actually reflects</font>

778
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:15,059
the reality of what they are doing

779
00:33:10,769 --> 00:33:17,879
<font color="#E5E5E5">because that binds them to be doing</font>

780
00:33:15,059 --> 00:33:19,950
those things right it doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> they</font>

781
00:33:17,879 --> 00:33:22,439
essentially have a privacy policy that

782
00:33:19,950 --> 00:33:25,799
says we can collect anything and do

783
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:27,720
anything<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so that sets the outer</font>

784
00:33:25,799 --> 00:33:29,879
<font color="#E5E5E5">boundary legal boundaries of what they</font>

785
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:32,399
can do and this is a this is a very big

786
00:33:29,879 --> 00:33:35,850
problem

787
00:33:32,399 --> 00:33:38,908
<font color="#CCCCCC">I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just have one question</font>

788
00:33:35,850 --> 00:33:42,719
<font color="#CCCCCC">i'm very interested in the NYC I'll use</font>

789
00:33:38,909 --> 00:33:45,450
you on how<font color="#E5E5E5"> sorry oh sorry</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm very</font>

00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:47,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">interesting the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> NYCLU view on how if</font>

791
00:33:45,450 --> 00:33:50,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">this is a system that's designed to give</font>

792
00:33:47,460 --> 00:33:52,620
those who do not have<font color="#CCCCCC"> or cannot afford</font>

793
00:33:50,100 --> 00:33:55,769
access to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> internet access to the</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">internet</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> normally for free</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm very</font>

795
00:33:55,769 --> 00:34:00,480
interested then and how that<font color="#E5E5E5"> into place</font>

796
00:33:57,360 --> 00:34:03,179
<font color="#E5E5E5">with who is unequally impacted by</font>

797
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:05,940
surveillance<font color="#E5E5E5"> in society</font>

798
00:34:03,180 --> 00:34:08,280
yes<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that's exactly one of the points</font>

799
00:34:05,940 --> 00:34:10,770
that we raised in the letter and that

800
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:13,080
this is a great initiative<font color="#CCCCCC"> and but it's</font>

801
00:34:10,770 --> 00:34:16,679
even more important to have really good

802
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:18,600
privacy policies in place because there

803
00:34:16,679 --> 00:34:20,489
are people who are going to be relying

804
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:23,880
on this technology in order to access

805
00:34:20,489 --> 00:34:27,389
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> internet and those are the people</font>

806
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:30,210
who are already subject to increase

807
00:34:27,389 --> 00:34:32,009
police surveillance and so we need to

808
00:34:30,210 --> 00:34:34,199
have policies in<font color="#E5E5E5"> place to ensure that</font>

809
00:34:32,010 --> 00:34:38,040
they can feel comfortable<font color="#CCCCCC"> comfortable</font>

810
00:34:34,199 --> 00:34:40,439
and confident using this service and

811
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:42,389
knowing that not all of their browsing

812
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:44,460
data is going to be collected and

813
00:34:42,389 --> 00:34:46,529
<font color="#CCCCCC">retained definitely and we can certainly</font>

814
00:34:44,460 --> 00:34:48,929
imagine if they are collecting

815
00:34:46,530 --> 00:34:51,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">entertaining all of this information and</font>

816

that there will be<font color="#E5E5E5"> government requests</font>

817
00:34:51,179 --> 00:34:57,750
for information from the NYPD or from

any other entity<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's another element</font>

819
00:34:57,750 --> 00:35:02,430

to be misleading in their privacy policy

<font color="#E5E5E5">and so if they stay in their privacy</font>
