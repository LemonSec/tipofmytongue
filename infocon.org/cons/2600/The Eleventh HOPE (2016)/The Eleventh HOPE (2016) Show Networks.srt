<font color="#E5E5E5">if you can just put something in there</font>

then there really were no networks in

00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:01,989
out in our industry and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then the</font>

nineteen nineties<font color="#E5E5E5"> around</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that time</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a few</font>

things like<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they were sort of made</font>

to<font color="#E5E5E5"> address the needs of our industry and</font>

73
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:14,739
an<font color="#CCCCCC"> ethernet of course existed then but</font>

74
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:18,070
it wasn't really very good for we were

75
00:03:14,739 --> 00:03:20,230
doing and the reasons was the basic

76
00:03:18,070 --> 00:03:21,940
<font color="#CCCCCC">ethernet has a built-in random back off</font>

77
00:03:20,230 --> 00:03:24,250
time after<font color="#E5E5E5"> a collision and we don't like</font>

78
00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:26,560
random<font color="#E5E5E5"> in our business because if we</font>

79
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:28,720
want the<font color="#CCCCCC"> white cue to go</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> now we don't</font>

80
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:31,090
want to go now today and then a couple

81
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:32,980
seconds later tomorrow and maybe 500

82
00:03:31,090 --> 00:03:34,660
milliseconds the next day<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're doing</font>

83
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:36,459
that on the magic show and you just gave

84
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:38,470
away the trick then you're fired so we

85
00:03:36,459 --> 00:03:40,030
don't like things that are random<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> our</font>

86
00:03:38,470 --> 00:03:42,400
business of timing is very important for

87
00:03:40,030 --> 00:03:43,989
us<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> thought</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I was not a great</font>

88
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:47,230
solution for that but we ended up using

89
00:03:43,989 --> 00:03:48,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">anyway thank you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i guess it's actually</font>

90
00:03:47,230 --> 00:03:53,410
watching out in the converter because it

91
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:55,929
looks<font color="#E5E5E5"> alright on my laptop here so the</font>

92
00:03:53,410 --> 00:03:57,579
<font color="#E5E5E5">ethernet random backup issue is solved</font>

93
00:03:55,930 --> 00:04:00,970
now because we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> full duplex</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> switches</font>

94
00:03:57,579 --> 00:04:04,359
and then now networks<font color="#E5E5E5"> have really become</font>

95
00:04:00,970 --> 00:04:06,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">just in the last you know 10 15 years</font>

96
00:04:04,359 --> 00:04:11,290
are really a backbone technology of

97
00:04:06,970 --> 00:04:13,239
almost every kind of show up to like

98
00:04:11,290 --> 00:04:14,709
hear the this<font color="#CCCCCC"> I actually helped prep the</font>

99
00:04:13,239 --> 00:04:16,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">sounds just another day here that does</font>

100
00:04:14,709 --> 00:04:18,130
not have a network in it but it's partly

101
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:19,599
we kept it very simple because we don't

102
00:04:18,130 --> 00:04:21,159
know<font color="#CCCCCC"> who's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> operating in that case it's</font>

103
00:04:19,599 --> 00:04:23,469
easier to troubleshoot<font color="#CCCCCC"> some other stuff</font>

104
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:25,539
<font color="#E5E5E5">but certainly if we're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> gonna</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do this</font>

105
00:04:23,470 --> 00:04:29,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">show we knew who the staff was we will</font>

106
00:04:25,539 --> 00:04:31,539
make it<font color="#CCCCCC"> doubly bone</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> around</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> network</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

107
00:04:29,650 --> 00:04:33,549
benefits of networking for us on<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> show</font>

108
00:04:31,539 --> 00:04:35,560
is we have error detection built in

109
00:04:33,550 --> 00:04:38,080
sometimes were firing dangerous things

110
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:39,669
<font color="#E5E5E5">pyro machinery stuff like that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to get</font>

111
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:42,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">hurt</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people so it's really important</font>

112
00:04:39,669 --> 00:04:46,150
that the the data gets to its intended

113
00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:47,950
location<font color="#CCCCCC"> intact and correctly so that's</font>

built<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the internet with a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> crc check</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">electrical isolation</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that's a big deal</font>

116
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:53,679
for us<font color="#CCCCCC"> too because</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we're often</font>

lighting control to run these lights

126
00:05:09,940 --> 00:05:15,849
here which is based almost certainly

127
00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:17,830
based on<font color="#CCCCCC"> DMX that the the amount of</font>

compared to that kind of control<font color="#CCCCCC"> they</font>

130
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:26,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">just sound like Donald Trump is a huge</font>

131
00:05:22,539 --> 00:05:28,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">there been so today almost every system</font>

132
00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:29,950
you're going to see on a show<font color="#E5E5E5"> has</font>

133
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:31,419
<font color="#E5E5E5">ethernet</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> department</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> somewhere</font>

00:05:29,950 --> 00:05:35,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">and we'll go through each one of those</font>

135
00:05:31,419 --> 00:05:38,169
uh yeah we're starting to see now<font color="#E5E5E5"> and in</font>

136
00:05:35,590 --> 00:05:40,450
professional audio for distribution of

137
00:05:38,169 --> 00:05:42,340
audio for live sound applications we are

138
00:05:40,450 --> 00:05:43,390
seeing that now over<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> standard</font>

139
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:45,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">Ethernet because we have enough</font>

140
00:05:43,390 --> 00:05:47,380
bandwidth and we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> this system called</font>

141
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:48,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">Dante which</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> has become very popular</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> aabb</font>

142
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:51,520
awesome

143
00:05:48,310 --> 00:05:52,870
so what's been interesting in my career

144
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:55,780
like we didn't have any of this stuff

145
00:05:52,870 --> 00:05:58,060
when we started out now it's everywhere

146
00:05:55,780 --> 00:06:00,429
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's have a big impact on the the</font>

147
00:05:58,060 --> 00:06:01,720
designers and technicians because people

148
00:06:00,430 --> 00:06:02,919
younger people that kind of grew up with

149
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:04,990
this stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> really kind of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have an</font>

150
00:06:02,919 --> 00:06:06,609
advantage<font color="#E5E5E5"> that people like my age who</font>

151
00:06:04,990 --> 00:06:10,210
weren't really staying on top of this

152
00:06:06,610 --> 00:06:11,320
stuff because the they just didn't have

153
00:06:10,210 --> 00:06:13,060
the opportunity to learn and we're

154
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:14,320
always you know in<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the middle of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

155
00:06:13,060 --> 00:06:16,479
show is not<font color="#CCCCCC"> a good time to be</font>

156
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:18,250
experimenting with things so we try to

157
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:19,870
learn things outside and then bring them

158
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:21,880
to the show<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and understand</font>

159
00:06:19,870 --> 00:06:24,250
understand how it works<font color="#E5E5E5"> we can make very</font>

160
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:27,219
reliable systems out of<font color="#E5E5E5"> this stuff and</font>

161
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:28,810
then<font color="#CCCCCC"> the right this is networks</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> offers</font>

162
00:06:27,219 --> 00:06:31,330
so much for so little so there's so much

163
00:06:28,810 --> 00:06:33,430
power available the network today that

164
00:06:31,330 --> 00:06:35,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">it's really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a core technology for</font>

165
00:06:33,430 --> 00:06:38,500
industry<font color="#E5E5E5"> so people like an art school we</font>

actually teach<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's a required class for</font>

00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:46,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I think that's a problem that in the</font>

171
00:06:46,390 --> 00:06:49,990
lagging a little bit behind<font color="#E5E5E5"> us we have</font>

174
00:06:52,450 --> 00:06:55,060
people just don't have the background

175
00:06:53,589 --> 00:06:58,539
and experience there are certainly

176
00:06:55,060 --> 00:07:00,159
people that do but<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's so that's an</font>

177
00:06:58,539 --> 00:07:02,649
issue<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's kind of a transitional thing</font>

178
00:07:00,159 --> 00:07:05,320
for us them<font color="#E5E5E5"> so what's different about a</font>

179
00:07:02,649 --> 00:07:06,849
show<font color="#E5E5E5"> network for us we don't put many</font>

181
00:07:06,849 --> 00:07:11,409
obvious reasons we don't want people

182
00:07:08,229 --> 00:07:14,050
messing with it<font color="#E5E5E5"> but also we don't want</font>

183
00:07:11,409 --> 00:07:15,399
the thing to run windows or apple<font color="#E5E5E5"> update</font>

184
00:07:14,050 --> 00:07:17,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">in the middle of the show</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> because if</font>

185
00:07:15,399 --> 00:07:19,690
you're trying to run you know 40 sound

186
00:07:17,830 --> 00:07:21,219
cues at once is not the best time to

187
00:07:19,690 --> 00:07:23,169
load down the processor<font color="#E5E5E5"> with something</font>

188
00:07:21,219 --> 00:07:25,240
else so it's not on the internet it

189
00:07:23,169 --> 00:07:27,490
makes that little bit easier

190
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:29,020
there are<font color="#CCCCCC"> sometimes</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> performance</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> where</font>

191
00:07:27,490 --> 00:07:30,580
like we did<font color="#E5E5E5"> a show a year ago</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a year or</font>

192
00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:32,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">two ago where we had live Twitter feed</font>

193
00:07:30,580 --> 00:07:34,330
to the screen so obviously that those

194
00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:36,460
machines were<font color="#CCCCCC"> connected the internet</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font>

195
00:07:34,330 --> 00:07:38,349
we actually did with two separate<font color="#E5E5E5"> Nick</font>

196
00:07:36,460 --> 00:07:40,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">adapters and really segmented out as</font>

197
00:07:38,349 --> 00:07:42,159
much as possible to do it

198
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:43,899
<font color="#E5E5E5">also we work in a difficult physical</font>

199
00:07:42,159 --> 00:07:45,580
environment so they were here until four

200
00:07:43,899 --> 00:07:48,370
o'clock this morning loading in all this

201
00:07:45,580 --> 00:07:50,620
stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> dragging it through the hallways</font>

202
00:07:48,370 --> 00:07:52,270
in and out of a truck<font color="#E5E5E5"> and if this was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

203
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:54,099
<font color="#CCCCCC">tour it would go back</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in the truck</font>

204
00:07:52,270 --> 00:07:56,289
tonight go somewhere else<font color="#CCCCCC"> get unloaded</font>

205
00:07:54,099 --> 00:07:59,169
<font color="#CCCCCC">the next day so our solutions need to be</font>

206
00:07:56,289 --> 00:08:00,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">heavy duty stuff just in general</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font>

207
00:07:59,169 --> 00:08:02,950
that's not something obviously the<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

208
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:05,200
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> rj45 connector was never really</font>

209
00:08:02,950 --> 00:08:07,419
designed for that kind of use<font color="#CCCCCC"> and we</font>

210
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:10,300
have some solutions for them<font color="#E5E5E5"> so we're</font>

211
00:08:07,419 --> 00:08:11,919
much more like a factory<font color="#CCCCCC"> than office</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

212
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:14,979
can use it for dangerous stuff we can

213
00:08:11,919 --> 00:08:16,570
fire<font color="#E5E5E5"> pyro with it moving scenery huge</font>

214
00:08:14,979 --> 00:08:18,520
moving scenery sometimes half of a

215
00:08:16,570 --> 00:08:19,659
building whatever it is we're doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font>

216
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:20,740
all these things

217
00:08:19,659 --> 00:08:22,599
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is something we have to take into</font>

218
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:25,750
consideration<font color="#CCCCCC"> when designing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this stuff</font>

219
00:08:22,599 --> 00:08:28,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">also this idea</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the show must go on</font>

220
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:31,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">reliability is really critical for us so</font>

221
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:33,610
we often have redundant systems<font color="#E5E5E5"> we often</font>

222
00:08:31,330 --> 00:08:35,649
have very strong sort of boundaries

223
00:08:33,610 --> 00:08:37,570
between systems so we can say<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> no</font>

224
00:08:35,649 --> 00:08:38,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">it's working up to this point</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and go</font>

225
00:08:37,570 --> 00:08:40,050
over here and sometimes that means we

226
00:08:38,890 --> 00:08:42,330
build things that look

227
00:08:40,049 --> 00:08:44,699
kind of crazy from<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of traditional</font>

228
00:08:42,330 --> 00:08:46,860
IT perspective<font color="#E5E5E5"> but it's important for us</font>

229
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:48,959
that if we if you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> you have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> lighting</font>

230
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:50,760
has a problem during the show<font color="#CCCCCC"> sounded</font>

231
00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:52,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">video and and scenery still need to be</font>

232
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:56,370
able to keep going so we have to factor

233
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:58,800
that in our in our system<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that's the</font>

234
00:08:56,370 --> 00:09:00,269
other problem we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> the reason why the</font>

235
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:02,819
show will have to go on<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's that's</font>

236
00:09:00,269 --> 00:09:04,500
our product that's what we sell and what

<font color="#CCCCCC">I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> mentioned before we have to be able to</font>

get the system working now<font color="#CCCCCC"> so it's a</font>

it comes out of a different shop and

00:13:10,850 --> 00:13:14,630
somebody made a different decision<font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font>

368
00:13:13,130 --> 00:13:16,250
we keep it that way because they really

00:13:58,700 --> 00:14:02,360
technologies<font color="#E5E5E5"> is we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> caught</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a happy for an</font>

390
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:04,339
audience because<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're really adapting</font>

391
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:07,459
technologies from other fields<font color="#E5E5E5"> also</font>

392
00:14:04,339 --> 00:14:09,950
within our industry<font color="#CCCCCC"> we use a lot of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do a</font>

393
00:14:07,459 --> 00:14:12,319
lot of system integration by solutions

394
00:14:09,950 --> 00:14:14,390
that are packaged up by manufacturers so

395
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:16,970
for example right now there was there

396
00:14:14,390 --> 00:14:19,279
<font color="#CCCCCC">was kind of a battle every battle but a</font>

397
00:14:16,970 --> 00:14:22,490
decision to be made about which audio

398
00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:25,640
network to be to use and some people are

399
00:14:22,490 --> 00:14:26,660
trying to pick by the network and<font color="#CCCCCC"> no one</font>

400
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:28,790
might be technically better than the

401
00:14:26,660 --> 00:14:30,380
other in the end as<font color="#CCCCCC"> end-users it doesn't</font>

402
00:14:28,790 --> 00:14:32,990
really matter which<font color="#E5E5E5"> one's better</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> at</font>

403
00:14:30,380 --> 00:14:35,000
matters which<font color="#E5E5E5"> 1i can use today so one</font>

404
00:14:32,990 --> 00:14:37,680
manufacturer in this case with<font color="#CCCCCC"> Dante and</font>

405
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:39,630
Yamaha Yamaha<font color="#E5E5E5"> odds are very big</font>

406
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:42,270
you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're big manufacturing</font>

407
00:14:39,630 --> 00:14:44,040
industry<font color="#E5E5E5"> they chose this technology and</font>

408
00:14:42,270 --> 00:14:45,600
if you use<font color="#CCCCCC"> Java</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> how</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> do you use that</font>

409
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:47,880
technology<font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> then we have to kind of go</font>

410
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:50,790
along with them<font color="#CCCCCC"> so we don't often get to</font>

411
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:52,439
everything necessary want to design that

412
00:14:50,790 --> 00:14:55,349
sort of<font color="#E5E5E5"> low-level back and stuff that</font>

413
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:57,720
comes to us from the people we buy gear

414
00:14:55,350 --> 00:14:59,459
from<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so that way we have a lot in</font>

415
00:14:57,720 --> 00:15:01,440
common with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the industrial controls and</font>

416
00:14:59,459 --> 00:15:03,719
factory automation market so we do use

417
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:05,399
some pieces of gear from them especially

418
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:08,130
for doing like a scenic automation

419
00:15:05,399 --> 00:15:09,600
system that is basically their gear we

420
00:15:08,130 --> 00:15:13,380
just use their stuff because it's the

421
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:15,959
same thing and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that said we do have some</font>

422
00:15:13,380 --> 00:15:18,180
show specific hardware so the switch on

423
00:15:15,959 --> 00:15:21,119
top is made by a company up in<font color="#E5E5E5"> Canada</font>

424
00:15:18,180 --> 00:15:22,620
called<font color="#CCCCCC"> think it's what's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> called pathway</font>

425
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:24,420
but they got bought by somebody so that

426
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:26,610
the name is very complicated<font color="#E5E5E5"> but that's</font>

427
00:15:24,420 --> 00:15:29,069
basically a standard switch but it knows

428
00:15:26,610 --> 00:15:31,200
about the protocols we use it has these

429
00:15:29,070 --> 00:15:32,580
kind of connectors on it<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can see</font>

430
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:35,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">that that's going to eat your Cod</font>

431
00:15:32,580 --> 00:15:37,020
connectors that's a standard<font color="#E5E5E5"> rj45</font>

432
00:15:35,490 --> 00:15:39,899
connector that fits inside<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> shell</font>

433
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:41,130
that plug<font color="#CCCCCC"> that same size of an XLR</font>

434
00:15:39,899 --> 00:15:43,050
connector which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> white</font>

435
00:15:41,130 --> 00:15:44,850
what comes out of this microphone so we

436
00:15:43,050 --> 00:15:47,699
already know we have panels punch<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

437
00:15:44,850 --> 00:15:49,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">size all this kind of stuff is there</font>

438
00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:51,029
now we also have<font color="#E5E5E5"> that same company</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> no</font>

439
00:15:49,350 --> 00:15:54,089
<font color="#E5E5E5">trick is making a similar thing for</font>

440
00:15:51,029 --> 00:15:56,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">fiber so that's a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> dual fiber connector</font>

441
00:15:54,089 --> 00:15:58,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">heavy-duty thing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that's easy for us on</font>

442
00:15:56,370 --> 00:16:00,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">unplug and plug</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> because something and</font>

443
00:15:58,470 --> 00:16:02,670
you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> what a big machine room in a</font>

444
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:04,020
data center<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be</font>

445
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:05,819
plugging<font color="#E5E5E5"> and unplugging their five run</font>

446
00:16:04,020 --> 00:16:07,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">everyday necessarily most cases they're</font>

447
00:16:05,820 --> 00:16:10,170
<font color="#CCCCCC">gonna</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> plug it in and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I don't touch it</font>

448
00:16:07,620 --> 00:16:11,610
until something breaks us if<font color="#CCCCCC"> we want or</font>

449
00:16:10,170 --> 00:16:12,779
<font color="#E5E5E5">we might plug this thing in and out</font>

450
00:16:11,610 --> 00:16:15,029
every single day

451
00:16:12,779 --> 00:16:17,189
<font color="#CCCCCC">throw</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in a truck get in the rain</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> do</font>

452
00:16:15,029 --> 00:16:19,200
something else so so this switch is set

453
00:16:17,190 --> 00:16:21,270
up to it either takes a standard<font color="#CCCCCC"> already</font>

454
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:23,700
45 or<font color="#CCCCCC"> to take one of these connectors</font>

455
00:16:21,270 --> 00:16:26,939
which is locking<font color="#CCCCCC"> the students know</font>

456
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:28,860
stupid<font color="#E5E5E5"> plastic tab the break off all</font>

457
00:16:26,940 --> 00:16:31,920
those things and then again it just has

458
00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:33,570
a knob so you can set some<font color="#CCCCCC"> bee lands in</font>

459
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:35,610
there without having to go to<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know</font>

460
00:16:33,570 --> 00:16:37,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">Cisco school or anything like that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

461
00:16:35,610 --> 00:16:39,899
<font color="#E5E5E5">also you can set up to just be aware of</font>

462
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:42,089
the protocols we use so some lighting

463
00:16:39,899 --> 00:16:44,339
control protocols some sound ones we use

464
00:16:42,089 --> 00:16:46,050
<font color="#CCCCCC">he just said if they I'm running Dante</font>

465
00:16:44,339 --> 00:16:46,410
on this thing running<font color="#CCCCCC"> streaming ACN</font>

466
00:16:46,050 --> 00:16:49,319
which<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

467
00:16:46,410 --> 00:16:50,939
<font color="#CCCCCC">talking about these</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> boom you're done</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

468
00:16:49,319 --> 00:16:53,610
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to go figure out how to do it</font>

469
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:55,139
and accommodated so again we mostly do

470
00:16:53,610 --> 00:16:58,829
<font color="#E5E5E5">sort of systems integration and try to</font>

471
00:16:55,139 --> 00:17:00,240
put all these things together so<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

472
00:16:58,829 --> 00:17:02,279
<font color="#CCCCCC">what's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> happened for us</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> show networks</font>

473
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:04,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">good and bad in our field we're very</font>

474
00:17:02,279 --> 00:17:06,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">sort of hands-on mostly very</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> hands-on</font>

475
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:08,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I include</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> myself in that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> dealing</font>

476
00:17:06,630 --> 00:17:10,919
with sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of abstract ideas</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of networks</font>

477
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:13,020
and like me and<font color="#CCCCCC"> very</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> mad number</font>

478
00:17:10,919 --> 00:17:14,730
challenge but you know this is

479
00:17:13,020 --> 00:17:17,490
everything I do is heavy and numbers so

480
00:17:14,730 --> 00:17:19,020
we figure out a way to deal with it and

481
00:17:17,490 --> 00:17:20,609
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the cool thing is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

482
00:17:19,020 --> 00:17:23,668
been good for our industry is in the

483
00:17:20,609 --> 00:17:25,020
past if you learned for example<font color="#CCCCCC"> DMX</font>

484
00:17:23,669 --> 00:17:27,630
which is very widely<font color="#CCCCCC"> used</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> lighting</font>

485
00:17:25,020 --> 00:17:29,730
control protocol that had nothing to do

486
00:17:27,630 --> 00:17:31,950
with sound right so other<font color="#E5E5E5"> than</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i used a</font>

487
00:17:29,730 --> 00:17:33,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">similar-looking connector so if you're</font>

488
00:17:31,950 --> 00:17:35,400
in the sound<font color="#E5E5E5"> Department</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> no</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> skill that</font>

489
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:36,990
you had really other than how to do<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

490
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:38,669
<font color="#E5E5E5">show and not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> freak</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> out under pressure</font>

491
00:17:36,990 --> 00:17:39,690
and things like that but technically

492
00:17:38,669 --> 00:17:42,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">there was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> no sort</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of technological</font>

493
00:17:39,690 --> 00:17:44,370
overlap<font color="#E5E5E5"> now we're all using network so</font>

494
00:17:42,330 --> 00:17:46,199
you know what an IP<font color="#E5E5E5"> addresses and you're</font>

495
00:17:44,370 --> 00:17:47,549
in the video crew<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can go</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

496
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:48,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">lighting crew and you still know what IP</font>

497
00:17:47,549 --> 00:17:50,789
addresses so that's actually really good

498
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:52,590
for us<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the other hand it's really</font>

499
00:17:50,789 --> 00:17:54,030
hard for people who have been in the

500
00:17:52,590 --> 00:17:56,189
industry for a long time that are very

501
00:17:54,030 --> 00:17:58,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">sore hands on people to deal with</font>

502
00:17:56,190 --> 00:18:00,270
networks because<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're very abstract</font>

503
00:17:58,020 --> 00:18:02,158
<font color="#E5E5E5">doesn't you know and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that's all</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> these</font>

504
00:18:00,270 --> 00:18:05,220
just numbers and weird stuff so it's a

505
00:18:02,159 --> 00:18:07,200
little difficult without the other good

506
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:11,039
thing that once we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> these</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sort of</font>

507
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:13,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">unified interface or access we can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font>

508
00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:14,850
much easier to troubleshoot<font color="#CCCCCC"> but that</font>

509
00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:16,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">also means that we have a common failure</font>

510
00:18:14,850 --> 00:18:17,879
point but again<font color="#E5E5E5"> it means</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that you have</font>

511
00:18:16,950 --> 00:18:19,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">spectra</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> tease</font>

512
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:21,090
maybe if you're having problems and

513
00:18:19,590 --> 00:18:22,740
sound<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> lighting guy can actually help</font>

514
00:18:21,090 --> 00:18:24,149
you out because they<font color="#E5E5E5"> know networks or</font>

515
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:25,740
whatever so that's been a very

516
00:18:24,150 --> 00:18:28,049
interesting transition this is really

517
00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:29,549
only in the last<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10 years</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that this has</font>

518
00:18:28,049 --> 00:18:31,080
become true and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I buddy</font>

519
00:18:29,549 --> 00:18:32,460

523
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:40,470
in the short run

524
00:18:38,159 --> 00:18:42,030
so once<font color="#E5E5E5"> like once the people in our</font>

526
00:18:42,030 --> 00:18:45,389
they can move forward with it so that's

527
00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:47,789
really good<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to talk a little</font>

00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:56,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">really lighting doesn't do anything</font>

little bit that's a long story but that

our shows has gotten very much larger

565

00:20:10,309 --> 00:20:14,928
<font color="#CCCCCC">artnet</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was a protocol made by guy in</font>

protocol<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can remember when but a while</font>

570
00:20:19,220 --> 00:20:24,140

00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:32,659
<font color="#CCCCCC">it was designed in a time when we</font>

weren't doing very<font color="#E5E5E5"> large-scale systems</font>

576
00:20:32,659 --> 00:20:38,270
so it works really well in a small kind

of you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one like in this room it</font>

578
00:20:38,270 --> 00:20:43,190
would work great but it actually use the

and over and over again which can kind

582
00:20:48,919 --> 00:20:52,279
of look like a broadcast<font color="#E5E5E5"> or</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> anything</font>

00:20:50,270 --> 00:20:54,320
<font color="#CCCCCC">like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that so it's not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it works</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> fine but</font>

584
00:20:52,279 --> 00:20:58,399
it's not really<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's better solutions</font>

585
00:20:54,320 --> 00:21:00,389
now moving forward and networking<font color="#E5E5E5"> so one</font>

586
00:20:58,399 --> 00:21:03,239
of the ones is developed

<font color="#CCCCCC">recalled ACN or architecture control</font>

is real expert on this

592
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:14,940
unfortunately<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ACN was really designed</font>

593
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:17,100
to replace all this<font color="#E5E5E5"> whole</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> point-to-point</font>

594
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:19,020
stuff and unfortunately industry wasn't

595
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:21,120
really ready for it and didn't adopt it

596
00:21:19,020 --> 00:21:23,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">so it was you know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> pure network-based</font>

597
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:26,610
standard<font color="#E5E5E5"> but we did take a subset of</font>

that<font color="#E5E5E5"> called</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> streaming ACN the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> take our</font>

00:21:37,620 --> 00:21:42,780
a very modern<font color="#E5E5E5"> Network focus protocol</font>

604
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:45,000
that deals with all the issues multicast

all these<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> things that we have</font>

issues with the modern networks is all

607
00:21:46,590 --> 00:21:52,199
covered by that so that's now those<font color="#E5E5E5"> two</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">system.string ACN and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Arnett</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are the two</font>

to deal with and all that stuff<font color="#CCCCCC"> so now</font>

622
00:22:20,010 --> 00:22:24,030
we can run one network cable just carry

623
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:25,409
all that same data<font color="#E5E5E5"> there so that just</font>

624
00:22:24,030 --> 00:22:27,330
practical reasons like that is really

625
00:22:25,410 --> 00:22:29,880
what started the adoption

626
00:22:27,330 --> 00:22:31,530
there's a lot more capability for

627
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:34,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">certain interactivity and lots of cool</font>

628

stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> and lighting which hasn't happened</font>

unfortunate<font color="#CCCCCC"> that sound we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> moved way</font>

beyond things we used to do<font color="#CCCCCC"> in light</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">kind of stuck in this 20-year old</font>

so so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> like ACN really kind of failed</font>

640
00:22:57,480 --> 00:23:01,410
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the market but string ACN is there</font>

00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:03,210
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's that's at least now we have a</font>

642
00:23:01,410 --> 00:23:04,890
network way to do it<font color="#CCCCCC"> so i think i'm</font>

643
00:23:03,210 --> 00:23:06,390
optimistic that over time you know the

but that really is the backbone of

660
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:43,720
everything that we do now in the

00:23:46,780 --> 00:23:51,490
the way<font color="#E5E5E5"> you would do it now it's just</font>

the picture before they<font color="#E5E5E5"> had fiber in and</font>

675
00:24:10,059 --> 00:24:15,428
then it actually comes out into the<font color="#CCCCCC"> DMX</font>

678
00:24:17,650 --> 00:24:22,299
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> as a big back phone around the</font>

00:24:22,299 --> 00:24:25,629
individual things because in the end

681
00:24:23,860 --> 00:24:28,299
there's there's only a few products<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

although my friends<font color="#CCCCCC"> at work on these</font>

shows say the the biggest<font color="#E5E5E5"> maintenance</font>

690
00:24:44,350 --> 00:24:47,590

693
00:24:50,919 --> 00:24:55,090
a funny story my friend who<font color="#CCCCCC"> my</font>

694

colleagues at school who subs in<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think</font>

he was on<font color="#CCCCCC"> book of mormon</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> these systems</font>

00:24:58,630 --> 00:25:03,910
had<font color="#E5E5E5"> a an audience member</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like it 758</font>

698
00:25:01,570 --> 00:25:05,889

699
00:25:03,910 --> 00:25:08,049
in the house and tripped and their

702
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:14,919
came through and hit the power button on

703
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:16,840
the console<font color="#E5E5E5"> so he's like the 755 ago</font>

to re-establish the<font color="#E5E5E5"> connections so we</font>

707
00:25:21,070 --> 00:25:24,800
always worried about crazy

708
00:25:22,940 --> 00:25:27,650
no gremlins in the network and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then so</font>

00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:29,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">now they have a metal plate mounted over</font>

710
00:25:27,650 --> 00:25:31,040
the power button so it's almost always

711
00:25:29,450 --> 00:25:36,260
some power switch or something like that

712

machinery<font color="#E5E5E5"> companies like back off</font>

have a safety<font color="#CCCCCC"> ratings system</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> inside that</font>

951
00:34:14,639 --> 00:34:17,760
so they build their own safety system

00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:19,409
<font color="#E5E5E5">and then that because if you're talking</font>

953
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:21,210
about machinery control stuff the

containers can hurt people

955
00:34:21,210 --> 00:34:24,720
that's really really important so we<font color="#CCCCCC"> but</font>

956
00:34:23,070 --> 00:34:26,940
now they figure it out because just

again the scale<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the economy of being</font>

962
00:34:36,699 --> 00:34:40,919
the same as<font color="#CCCCCC"> anybody on</font>

963
00:34:39,060 --> 00:34:42,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">great so I think we have two minutes</font>

we using<font color="#CCCCCC"> vlans for safety</font>

968
00:34:55,530 --> 00:35:00,030
really it's more because we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it</font>

969
00:34:58,200 --> 00:35:02,520
just sort of makes its kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> over</font>

970
00:35:00,030 --> 00:35:05,160
killing<font color="#CCCCCC"> which we like to do in reality</font>

even that haunted house with all the

is like<font color="#CCCCCC"> two percent even Dante with like</font>

00:35:11,790 --> 00:35:17,190
40 channels of whatever is like maybe

976
00:35:14,910 --> 00:35:18,930
five or ten percent of the network so

977
00:35:17,190 --> 00:35:20,550
<font color="#CCCCCC">band width wise we can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> handle obviously</font>

the same switching<font color="#CCCCCC"> fabrics handling all</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff anyway</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's really more kind</font>

of<font color="#CCCCCC"> asked coverage so if something</font>

happened in this lighting system and it

had a you know just<font color="#CCCCCC"> had a broadcast</font>

lighting<font color="#CCCCCC"> and video and those kind of</font>

00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:36,390
things wouldn't even<font color="#E5E5E5"> wouldn't be</font>

987
00:35:36,390 --> 00:35:40,350
for a<font color="#CCCCCC"> bandwidth reason it's more just</font>

sort of operational<font color="#CCCCCC"> were</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> always</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> planning</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">and anticipating</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> how can things go wrong</font>

990
00:35:42,930 --> 00:35:46,500
and then what<font color="#E5E5E5"> does that failure mode</font>

991
00:35:44,580 --> 00:35:48,270
look like and how<font color="#E5E5E5"> can we avoid it so</font>

992
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:58,750
that that's kind of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> the approach for</font>

00:35:48,270 --> 00:36:05,300
that one more question

<font color="#CCCCCC">like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font>

1002
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:29,470
of things like here we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> hd-sdi</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> which</font>

kind of just stay in the low and
