it a lot of times discussions of free

41
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:44,070
these are real issues that affect real

<font color="#E5E5E5">real people and I thought that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> talk did</font>

45
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:55,979
right now there's a big discussion going

46
00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:59,579
on about police brutality police

47
00:01:55,979 --> 00:02:02,250
misconduct<font color="#E5E5E5"> especially directed at</font>

minorities particularly black<font color="#CCCCCC"> Americans</font>

49
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:09,860
and that's largely due to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet</font>

50
00:02:06,530 --> 00:02:12,560
the ability to take<font color="#CCCCCC"> cell phone videos to</font>

share those globally<font color="#E5E5E5"> within an instant</font>

00:02:31,489 --> 00:02:36,500
the internet that becomes much harder

00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:38,570
than it's ever been in history<font color="#CCCCCC"> so that's</font>

60

that's really one of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> the fundamental</font>

ideas of<font color="#E5E5E5"> why the Internet can be so</font>

64
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:56,870
here

<font color="#E5E5E5">01 more motivation more mundane</font>

67
00:02:59,330 --> 00:03:03,860
of our lives probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have the</font>

68
00:03:02,030 --> 00:03:06,650
internet right now run by a lot of

69
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:11,480
for-profit companies who are collecting

70
00:03:06,650 --> 00:03:12,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">user data in proprietary silos and</font>

71
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:14,570
they're driven by profit<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're not</font>

72
00:03:12,890 --> 00:03:16,670
trying to censor people they're trying

73
00:03:14,570 --> 00:03:18,140
to sell<font color="#E5E5E5"> targeted ads and and doing a</font>

74
00:03:16,670 --> 00:03:22,369
pretty good job of making money at it

75
00:03:18,140 --> 00:03:24,170
but this affects a form of censorship<font color="#CCCCCC"> if</font>

76
00:03:22,370 --> 00:03:26,989
<font color="#CCCCCC">I want to share something on facebook</font>

77
00:03:24,170 --> 00:03:29,540
and you're not on<font color="#CCCCCC"> facebook</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i can make it</font>

78
00:03:26,989 --> 00:03:34,880
public<font color="#CCCCCC"> but I can't share it with you</font>

79
00:03:29,540 --> 00:03:37,010
so my my inability to share something on

80
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:40,190
any of these proprietary flat platforms

81
00:03:37,010 --> 00:03:42,649
is a form of censorship and just the

82
00:03:40,190 --> 00:03:46,040
fact that this data is stored in one

83
00:03:42,650 --> 00:03:48,799
place or under the control of one

84
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:50,959
company creates a real danger of that

85
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:55,880
data being<font color="#E5E5E5"> censored and you can also</font>

86
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:58,700
find examples<font color="#E5E5E5"> that all over the place so</font>

87
00:03:55,880 --> 00:04:01,340
back<font color="#E5E5E5"> to this quote the net interpret</font>

88
00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:03,619
censorship is damaged and routes around

89
00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:06,440
it<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to go into whether or not</font>

90
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:08,690
this is true how true it is<font color="#E5E5E5"> but first</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

91
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:11,810
want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to dig a little deeper as to what</font>

92
00:04:08,690 --> 00:04:13,370
it actually means<font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i see it as</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

93
00:04:11,810 --> 00:04:15,470
statement about two things which is why

94
00:04:13,370 --> 00:04:17,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">I chose it for this talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> one it's a</font>

95
00:04:15,470 --> 00:04:18,769
statement about networks

96
00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:20,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">when you're talking about routings</font>

97
00:04:18,769 --> 00:04:22,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">you're talking routing you're talking</font>

98
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:23,780
about how people are connected to each

99
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:24,620
other<font color="#CCCCCC"> how computers are connected to</font>

100
00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:26,929
each other

101
00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:30,020
I study<font color="#E5E5E5"> networks</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I think networks are</font>

102
00:04:26,930 --> 00:04:32,840
really important in this topic of

103
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:34,669
censorship and expression<font color="#CCCCCC"> so that's one</font>

104
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:41,929
reason that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm focusing on it and the</font>

105
00:04:34,669 --> 00:04:43,549
other is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the idea of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> decentralisation so</font>

106
00:04:41,930 --> 00:04:45,710
if you say you can route around

107
00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:47,270
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that means that there's</font>

108
00:04:45,710 --> 00:04:49,638
nothing on the internet that is so

109
00:04:47,270 --> 00:04:51,919
central<font color="#E5E5E5"> so important that if it's</font>

110
00:04:49,639 --> 00:04:53,449
censored and removed that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can't take</font>

111
00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:56,330
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you can't go around it that you</font>

112
00:04:53,449 --> 00:04:59,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">can't replace it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so that's that's really</font>

113
00:04:56,330 --> 00:05:00,469
the the gist of this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is saying that</font>

114
00:04:59,060 --> 00:05:02,240
there's nothing so important in the

115
00:05:00,470 --> 00:05:03,860
network of the internet that you can't

116
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:06,380
find a path around it to connect to

117
00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:08,690
everything else<font color="#E5E5E5"> and in addition to</font>

118
00:05:06,380 --> 00:05:11,810
censorship<font color="#CCCCCC"> this really generalizes to</font>

119
00:05:08,690 --> 00:05:15,320
any kind of targeted attack<font color="#CCCCCC"> so there's</font>

120
00:05:11,810 --> 00:05:17,150
no target<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's so central</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so let's</font>

121
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:20,630
let's see if this is actually true how

122
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:24,530
true it is<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'll give a few examples</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one</font>

148
00:06:30,910 --> 00:06:35,530
the FBI wanted to surveil the emails

going through that service

150
00:06:35,530 --> 00:06:40,659
<font color="#CCCCCC">well that kind of defeats the purpose of</font>

prevent that from happening including

printing the keys out in a tiny font and

giving the papers to the FBI<font color="#CCCCCC"> but that</font>

comply with the order without allowing

00:07:08,230 --> 00:07:14,830
up becoming censorship and it's worth

00:07:12,550 --> 00:07:16,660
mentioning here that they had great

164
00:07:16,660 --> 00:07:23,500
here this was legal coercion<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know</font>

165
00:07:21,550 --> 00:07:25,240
this was a targeted attack but it wasn't

166
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:27,970
a technical attack<font color="#CCCCCC"> it was a social</font>

167
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:31,060
attack<font color="#CCCCCC"> so that's kind of a theme that</font>

168
00:07:27,970 --> 00:07:33,640
will come up throughout this talk and

169

the third and final example<font color="#CCCCCC"> of something</font>

182
00:08:11,590 --> 00:08:17,260
all but still relying on<font color="#CCCCCC"> Censorship</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">sorry on centralization to create a</font>

184
00:08:17,260 --> 00:08:25,990

that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> started with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you shouldn't work</font>

186
00:08:25,990 --> 00:08:28,480
right

187
00:08:26,470 --> 00:08:32,169
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> internet is decentralized well</font>

188
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:35,620
that's partially true<font color="#CCCCCC"> tcp</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the protocol</font>

189

socio-technical system<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that's</font>

198
00:08:57,430 --> 00:09:01,120
something that comes up in my research a

199
00:08:59,170 --> 00:09:03,969
lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you want to talk about</font>

this<font color="#CCCCCC"> i won't go into detail but if</font>

00:09:18,850 --> 00:09:24,040
the social systems around that the

<font color="#E5E5E5">decision-making governance everything</font>

208
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:28,150
<font color="#CCCCCC">that's implementing those technical</font>

209
00:09:25,330 --> 00:09:32,110
systems are also<font color="#E5E5E5"> decentralized so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

210
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:33,490
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> like to be aware of that thinking</font>

211
00:09:32,110 --> 00:09:37,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">about these issues and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i encourage all</font>

212
00:09:33,490 --> 00:09:40,120
of you to do the same<font color="#E5E5E5"> in your work so if</font>

213
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:45,400
your system depends on a single physical

214
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:48,310
location<font color="#E5E5E5"> if it depends on a single legal</font>

215
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:50,709
jurisdiction<font color="#E5E5E5"> if it's controlled by</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

216
00:09:48,310 --> 00:09:52,540
single<font color="#E5E5E5"> legal entity</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's really not to</font>

217
00:09:50,710 --> 00:09:55,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">centralize</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all of these things subject</font>

218
00:09:52,540 --> 00:09:58,689
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> maybe not too technical attacks but</font>

219
00:09:55,840 --> 00:10:02,650
to legal coercion and other forms of

220
00:09:58,690 --> 00:10:04,090
targeted attacks so<font color="#E5E5E5"> decentralizing these</font>

221
00:10:02,650 --> 00:10:06,310
is really easy you just break your

222
00:10:04,090 --> 00:10:07,960
system<font color="#CCCCCC"> into parts</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and you give them out</font>

223
00:10:06,310 --> 00:10:10,449
to people in different places under

224
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:13,090
different jurisdictions<font color="#E5E5E5"> controlled by</font>

225
00:10:10,450 --> 00:10:14,530
different legal entities but<font color="#E5E5E5"> then you</font>

226
00:10:13,090 --> 00:10:15,670
need a way for all those parts to talk

227
00:10:14,530 --> 00:10:17,709
to each other which is where the

228
00:10:15,670 --> 00:10:21,610
networking comes in

229
00:10:17,710 --> 00:10:23,530
so this is this is what I primarily

230
00:10:21,610 --> 00:10:25,960
study this is primarily the subject of

231
00:10:23,530 --> 00:10:27,400
the talk when you connect all those

232
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:28,960
different parts to each other

233
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:31,689
you can do it in ways that are more or

234
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:33,790
less centralized ways that allow that

235
00:10:31,690 --> 00:10:36,970
kind of routing around<font color="#E5E5E5"> censorship in</font>

236
00:10:33,790 --> 00:10:38,410
ways that don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> so so this is this is</font>

237
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:40,090
what<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm here to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> talk to you about how</font>

238
00:10:38,410 --> 00:10:43,000
how do we actually do that how do we

239
00:10:40,090 --> 00:10:45,820
build and design a decentralized network

240
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:49,290
that that is resistant to these types of

241
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:51,870
censorship and targeted attacks

242
00:10:49,290 --> 00:10:53,339
<font color="#CCCCCC">and before I start trying to start</font>

243
00:10:51,870 --> 00:10:56,130
answering that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I would just want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

244
00:10:53,339 --> 00:10:57,420
throw out some terminology and clarify

245
00:10:56,130 --> 00:10:59,370
what I mean when I say<font color="#CCCCCC"> network</font>

246
00:10:57,420 --> 00:11:02,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">networking a lot of things very</font>

247
00:10:59,370 --> 00:11:04,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">overloaded word</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in this talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm using</font>

248
00:11:02,790 --> 00:11:07,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">it in the network science sense so it's</font>

249
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:10,199
very abstract<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have some things the</font>

250
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:14,219
things could be people<font color="#CCCCCC"> the things could</font>

251
00:11:10,199 --> 00:11:15,990
be computers but we don't care what they

252
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:18,060
are<font color="#CCCCCC"> we just care that there are things</font>

253
00:11:15,990 --> 00:11:20,490
so i'll call them<font color="#E5E5E5"> notes i'll call them</font>

254
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:22,349
vertices<font color="#CCCCCC"> if any of you are</font>

255
00:11:20,490 --> 00:11:25,199
mathematicians and<font color="#E5E5E5"> no graph theory this</font>

256
00:11:22,350 --> 00:11:28,350
should all be really familiar<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the</font>

257
00:11:25,199 --> 00:11:30,329
other important thing about these things

258
00:11:28,350 --> 00:11:33,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">is that they have relationships with</font>

259
00:11:30,329 --> 00:11:35,430
each other<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you have if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> your things</font>

260
00:11:33,630 --> 00:11:37,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">are people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the relationships could be</font>

261
00:11:35,430 --> 00:11:39,779
friendships they could be trust

00:11:37,290 --> 00:11:42,930
relationships<font color="#E5E5E5"> if their computers they</font>

00:11:39,779 --> 00:11:45,720
could be wired or wireless links<font color="#CCCCCC"> but</font>

264
00:11:42,930 --> 00:11:47,609
<font color="#E5E5E5">again as far as network structure we</font>

265
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:50,339
don't care about the details we just

266
00:11:47,610 --> 00:11:55,470
care which things are in relationships

through the through the math part they

first started by taking both a network

of all the routers on the internet that

281

that they got the data for and the links

282
00:12:31,769 --> 00:12:37,649
on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> world wide web and they started</font>

283
00:12:34,110 --> 00:12:39,540
by removing<font color="#E5E5E5"> notes from those networks</font>

and seeing how the<font color="#E5E5E5"> network's change</font>

pretty resilient against random failures

318
00:14:12,610 --> 00:14:19,390
simple it means there are a few nodes

341
00:15:16,690 --> 00:15:21,790
extending and modifying the web of trust

model<font color="#E5E5E5"> in a way that lets us address some</font>

343
00:15:21,790 --> 00:15:26,079
of these limitations

00:15:23,140 --> 00:15:29,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">we're calling this modified model the</font>

345
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:31,420
partial trust model and it starts with

346
00:15:29,020 --> 00:15:34,750
the assumption that you can trust

347
00:15:31,420 --> 00:15:37,089
everyone<font color="#CCCCCC"> friends of friends</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> up to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

348
00:15:34,750 --> 00:15:41,290
fixed number of hops away<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know so in</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">this case</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> two hops</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that's still not</font>

350
00:15:41,290 --> 00:15:45,490
entirely realistic assumption but it's

351
00:15:43,870 --> 00:15:47,230
at least more realistic than assuming

352
00:15:45,490 --> 00:15:53,200
you can do that to infinity

353
00:15:47,230 --> 00:15:55,600
now the other assumption is that you

354
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:59,350
know beyond that there is an adversary

355
00:15:55,600 --> 00:16:02,050
who has the ability to compromise<font color="#CCCCCC"> some</font>

fixed number of nodes adversaries

357
00:16:02,050 --> 00:16:07,660
usually have some limit on the resources

358
00:16:04,930 --> 00:16:09,339
which is why we make this assumption<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

359
00:16:07,660 --> 00:16:12,850
in this model that the trusted nodes

362

outside of those you have an untrusted

370
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:43,750
the whole point of having a model<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

371

00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:26,270
to compromise<font color="#E5E5E5"> anymore</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is where a</font>

405
00:18:25,010 --> 00:18:29,960
lot of the power<font color="#E5E5E5"> in this model comes</font>

406
00:18:26,270 --> 00:18:32,510
from the ability to simplify<font color="#CCCCCC"> another</font>

407
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:35,300
nice thing is if there are no

408
00:18:32,510 --> 00:18:38,450
bottlenecks in the untrusted region

409
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:40,520
which is true for a lot of networks and

410
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:43,130
some of the ones<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'll mention later then</font>

411
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:46,879
the bottleneck winds up being the trust

412
00:18:43,130 --> 00:18:49,550
boundary<font color="#CCCCCC"> so the number of paths is</font>

413
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:53,000
simply the size of<font color="#CCCCCC"> Alice's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> trust</font>

414
00:18:49,550 --> 00:18:54,409
boundary or<font color="#CCCCCC"> Bob's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> trust boundary or the</font>

415
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:58,190
smaller of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> two whichever is the</font>

416
00:18:54,410 --> 00:19:00,680
bottleneck<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we can we can further</font>

417
00:18:58,190 --> 00:19:02,270
simplify this<font color="#E5E5E5"> because really we just</font>

418
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:04,500
care about whether the message gets

419
00:19:02,270 --> 00:19:07,800
through the untrusted region

420
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:09,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">so now we have some number of</font>

421
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:14,909
independent channels in the untrusted

422
00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:16,800
region and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> each with one node which</font>

423
00:19:14,910 --> 00:19:20,790
is equivalent to compromising the entire

424
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:24,000
path that that<font color="#E5E5E5"> milk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and compromise so</font>

425
00:19:20,790 --> 00:19:27,690
this this is our partial trust model and

426
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:31,740
now<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'd like to use this to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> analyze a</font>

427
00:19:27,690 --> 00:19:35,670
particular type of routing algorithm and

428
00:19:31,740 --> 00:19:38,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">error correction and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> fault tolerance so</font>

429
00:19:35,670 --> 00:19:39,900
it's a type of routing<font color="#CCCCCC"> has</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> been around</font>

430
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:42,510
for<font color="#CCCCCC"> awhile called concurrent multipath</font>

431
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:45,480
routing and the idea is simply that you

432
00:19:42,510 --> 00:19:46,320
send multiple copies of a message in

433
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:50,370
parallel

434
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:52,530
it's used a lot for<font color="#CCCCCC"> fault</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> tolerance</font>

435
00:19:50,370 --> 00:19:53,820
against random faults but there hasn't

436
00:19:52,530 --> 00:19:56,910
been a lot of work

437
00:19:53,820 --> 00:20:00,060
applying it to targeted attacks targeted

438
00:19:56,910 --> 00:20:02,580
faults<font color="#E5E5E5"> and one of the things we get from</font>

439
00:20:00,060 --> 00:20:07,200
the partial trust model is the ability

491
00:22:39,370 --> 00:22:41,860
first<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing you'll notice is that most</font>

492
00:22:40,630 --> 00:22:44,049
of this graph is black

493
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:46,750
that's good because that means low

494
00:22:44,049 --> 00:22:47,559
probability<font color="#E5E5E5"> and if you look a little</font>

495
00:22:46,750 --> 00:22:50,350
closer

496
00:22:47,559 --> 00:22:54,549
it's interesting because a<font color="#E5E5E5"> a large</font>

497
00:22:50,350 --> 00:22:56,350
increase in attack power on<font color="#E5E5E5"> males and</font>

498
00:22:54,549 --> 00:22:59,710
can be compensated by a very small

499
00:22:56,350 --> 00:23:02,469
increase in the number of copies sent by

500
00:22:59,710 --> 00:23:05,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">sent by</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Alice so that means that this</font>

501
00:23:02,470 --> 00:23:08,049
scheme is fundamentally<font color="#E5E5E5"> difficult to</font>

502
00:23:05,710 --> 00:23:09,880
attack and easy to defend<font color="#CCCCCC"> so that's</font>

503
00:23:08,049 --> 00:23:12,070
that's definitely a property that you

504
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:15,159
want in any kind of censorship or attack

505
00:23:12,070 --> 00:23:17,049
resistance and there's one even more

506
00:23:15,159 --> 00:23:19,390
interesting thing that you can actually

507
00:23:17,049 --> 00:23:23,080
see in this graph because it's just

508
00:23:19,390 --> 00:23:24,780
plotted for one number of possible paths

509
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:27,780
in this case 25

510
00:23:24,780 --> 00:23:31,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">but the probability of an undetectable</font>

511
00:23:27,780 --> 00:23:34,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">error decreases exponentially with the</font>

512
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:36,960
number of possible paths even if<font color="#CCCCCC"> Alice</font>

513
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:38,939
only uses the same number of those<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

514
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:40,170
think about that for a second that's

515
00:23:38,940 --> 00:23:41,910
really cool

516
00:23:40,170 --> 00:23:47,220
Alice doesn't have to do any extra work

517
00:23:41,910 --> 00:23:49,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">but gets an exponential increase in her</font>

518

protection from attack<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> by being</font>

519
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:53,970

520
00:23:51,930 --> 00:23:57,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this is what we're really trying to</font>

521
00:23:53,970 --> 00:23:59,430
get out we're trying to understand<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

522
00:23:57,270 --> 00:24:02,760
what Alice does not what Bob does not

what<font color="#E5E5E5"> you not what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> eve</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> or</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> mail does but</font>

524
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:08,700
how the actual structure of the network

525
00:24:04,650 --> 00:24:12,750
can provide protection

526
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:14,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">ok so this doesn't actually tell us how</font>

527
00:24:12,750 --> 00:24:17,100
to get this network this just says we

528
00:24:14,250 --> 00:24:18,750
want a network with lots of<font color="#E5E5E5"> paths so</font>

529
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:21,240
let's go back to the model and try to

530
00:24:18,750 --> 00:24:23,640
figure out how we can do that

531
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:26,490
well we're assuming that the bottleneck

532
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:29,550
is the trust boundary which is the set

533
00:24:26,490 --> 00:24:34,200
of nodes that is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> however many hops</font>

534
00:24:29,550 --> 00:24:37,889
away you trust<font color="#E5E5E5"> in this case</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> too and that</font>

535
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:39,480
gives us the size of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> that gives us</font>

536
00:24:37,890 --> 00:24:42,150
the man cut that gives us the number of

537
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:44,970
paths so we want that to be big<font color="#E5E5E5"> so we</font>

538
00:24:42,150 --> 00:24:48,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">want a network where as you move away</font>

00:24:44,970 --> 00:24:52,020
from any node<font color="#E5E5E5"> you very quickly reach a</font>

00:24:52,020 --> 00:24:54,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">just call that connectivity for the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sake</font>

542
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:57,510
of this talk

543
00:24:54,960 --> 00:25:00,180
there are lots<font color="#CCCCCC"> of different slightly</font>

544
00:24:57,510 --> 00:25:03,150
related terms in network science that I

545
00:25:00,180 --> 00:25:06,180
can totally geeked out<font color="#E5E5E5"> up with you about</font>

546
00:25:03,150 --> 00:25:09,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">offline but that's that's our goal</font>

547
00:25:06,180 --> 00:25:10,770
that's what we want in

548
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:13,230
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I've</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> been looking at a type of</font>

549
00:25:10,770 --> 00:25:16,290
network called<font color="#E5E5E5"> vertex transit networks</font>

550
00:25:13,230 --> 00:25:18,270
the idea is simple<font color="#CCCCCC"> every node is</font>

551
00:25:16,290 --> 00:25:21,240
structurally equivalent to every other

552
00:25:18,270 --> 00:25:23,190
node<font color="#E5E5E5"> so there's there's no way to tell</font>

553
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:26,430
them apart<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can think about the the</font>

554
00:25:23,190 --> 00:25:28,380
corners on a square<font color="#CCCCCC"> there each connected</font>

555
00:25:26,430 --> 00:25:30,390
to two other corners and the

556
00:25:28,380 --> 00:25:34,440
relationships between those corners or

557
00:25:30,390 --> 00:25:37,080
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> there both on opposite sides</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

558
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:38,460
these networks are in a way that the

559
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:41,460
most<font color="#E5E5E5"> decentralized you can</font>

560
00:25:38,460 --> 00:25:45,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">it if every note is equal there's no way</font>

561
00:25:41,460 --> 00:25:47,430
for anyone to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> central and they've</font>

562
00:25:45,570 --> 00:25:51,270
been<font color="#E5E5E5"> known and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> used a long time in</font>

563
00:25:47,430 --> 00:25:54,540
parallel processing<font color="#E5E5E5"> particularly because</font>

564
00:25:51,270 --> 00:25:56,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">they're very rigidly defined network and</font>

565
00:25:54,540 --> 00:25:57,690
in parallel processing<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can do that</font>

566
00:25:56,430 --> 00:26:00,600
you know if you're building a network

567
00:25:57,690 --> 00:26:02,250
processors so one of the one of the

568
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:06,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">networks have been looking at is the M</font>

569
00:26:02,250 --> 00:26:08,340
dimensional cube<font color="#CCCCCC"> this is just in one</font>

570
00:26:06,570 --> 00:26:10,290
dimension at the line<font color="#CCCCCC"> two dimensions</font>

571
00:26:08,340 --> 00:26:13,050
it's a square<font color="#CCCCCC"> three</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> dimensions</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that's a</font>

572
00:26:10,290 --> 00:26:14,790
cube and if you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> weird mathematician</font>

573
00:26:13,050 --> 00:26:17,669
like me you can just keep counting up

574
00:26:14,790 --> 00:26:20,430
and drawing lots of crazy pictures and

575
00:26:17,670 --> 00:26:22,080
it and the math works out and this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a</font>

576
00:26:20,430 --> 00:26:24,870
vertex<font color="#E5E5E5"> transit network that is kinda</font>

577
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:28,320
useful<font color="#E5E5E5"> the other is really neat</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

578
00:26:24,870 --> 00:26:30,719
<font color="#E5E5E5">learned about this a few months ago</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

579
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:31,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">if you're into this kind of stuff and</font>

580
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:34,860
you haven't heard of it you should look

581
00:26:31,830 --> 00:26:37,379
at it but it's called the butterfly<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font>

582
00:26:34,860 --> 00:26:40,500
based on a hypercube<font color="#CCCCCC"> an M dimensional</font>

583
00:26:37,380 --> 00:26:43,830
cube<font color="#E5E5E5"> but each row corresponds to a</font>

584
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:47,910
binary number<font color="#E5E5E5"> each column corresponds to</font>

585
00:26:43,830 --> 00:26:51,000
an index in that binary number the nodes

586
00:26:47,910 --> 00:26:54,510
corresponding<font color="#E5E5E5"> all the nodes in the same</font>

587
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:58,020
row are all connected in a ring and

588
00:26:54,510 --> 00:27:00,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">nodes in different rows are connected by</font>

589
00:26:58,020 --> 00:27:03,629
a bit flip so they're connected if they

590
00:27:00,810 --> 00:27:05,429
have one bit different and which bit

591
00:27:03,630 --> 00:27:09,540
depends on which<font color="#CCCCCC"> comments in you get</font>

592
00:27:05,430 --> 00:27:11,400
this kind of neat pattern<font color="#E5E5E5"> so what are</font>

593
00:27:09,540 --> 00:27:15,090
the connectivity properties of these

594
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:17,430
<font color="#CCCCCC">well they're both exponential in the</font>

595
00:27:15,090 --> 00:27:21,360
number of hops that you trust so that's

596
00:27:17,430 --> 00:27:24,690
pretty good<font color="#E5E5E5"> and even</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> more interesting</font>

597
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:28,409
thing is that for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> M dimensional cube</font>

598
00:27:24,690 --> 00:27:31,020
<font color="#CCCCCC">the base of that exponent</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> grows with the</font>

599
00:27:28,410 --> 00:27:35,070
size of the network<font color="#E5E5E5"> so as the network</font>

600
00:27:31,020 --> 00:27:38,760
gets bigger<font color="#E5E5E5"> your connectivity grows</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

601
00:27:35,070 --> 00:27:41,159
is also really cool<font color="#CCCCCC"> it means that as the</font>

602
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:44,820
network gets bigger<font color="#CCCCCC"> your</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ability to</font>

603
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:48,120
resist attack targeted attack increases

604
00:27:44,820 --> 00:27:50,119
<font color="#CCCCCC">so that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a really desirable property</font>

605
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:52,938
this is not true<font color="#E5E5E5"> the butterfly</font>

606
00:27:50,119 --> 00:27:55,938
<font color="#CCCCCC">but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the butterfly has a different kind</font>

607
00:27:52,939 --> 00:28:00,979
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> benefit and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> trade-off here which is</font>

608
00:27:55,939 --> 00:28:04,369
that the number of connections in each

609
00:28:00,979 --> 00:28:06,439
node increases on the cube as the

610
00:28:04,369 --> 00:28:09,918
network<font color="#CCCCCC"> grows whereas with the butterfly</font>

611
00:28:06,439 --> 00:28:12,319
<font color="#CCCCCC">each node is only connected at its</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ever</font>

00:28:09,919 --> 00:28:14,239
only connected<font color="#CCCCCC"> 24</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> other nodes so the</font>

613
00:28:12,319 --> 00:28:16,849
<font color="#E5E5E5">butterfly scales a lot better than the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> M</font>

614
00:28:14,239 --> 00:28:19,849
cube but the<font color="#CCCCCC"> M</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> cubed gives you this</font>

615
00:28:16,849 --> 00:28:23,418
really cool property of getting more

616
00:28:19,849 --> 00:28:25,309
<font color="#CCCCCC">fault tolerant as it grows and part of</font>

617
00:28:23,419 --> 00:28:27,589
the research<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm doing is looking at</font>

618
00:28:25,309 --> 00:28:29,569
other networks and trying to find

619
00:28:27,589 --> 00:28:33,379
<font color="#E5E5E5">networks to kind of give you the best of</font>

620
00:28:29,569 --> 00:28:36,769
both worlds here so<font color="#CCCCCC"> so that's kind of</font>

621
00:28:33,379 --> 00:28:38,029
the end of the research that<font color="#CCCCCC"> i've</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i've</font>

622
00:28:36,769 --> 00:28:38,809
been doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I should talk about</font>

623
00:28:38,029 --> 00:28:41,509
limitations

624
00:28:38,809 --> 00:28:42,799
yeah yeah that's fair yes the

625
00:28:41,509 --> 00:28:46,459
limitations of this like<font color="#CCCCCC"> I said these</font>

626
00:28:42,799 --> 00:28:48,739
are<font color="#CCCCCC"> kinda rigidly defined network so you</font>

627
00:28:46,459 --> 00:28:50,929
don't have flexible trust you have to

628
00:28:48,739 --> 00:28:54,319
build the trust relationships in a

629
00:28:50,929 --> 00:28:58,639
particular pattern there are use cases

630
00:28:54,319 --> 00:29:02,749
where that's where that's feasible<font color="#CCCCCC"> see</font>

631
00:28:58,639 --> 00:29:04,879
<font color="#CCCCCC">have a list of limitations here</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the and</font>

632
00:29:02,749 --> 00:29:08,239
the other is that as I said<font color="#E5E5E5"> before</font>

633
00:29:04,879 --> 00:29:11,119
<font color="#E5E5E5">really the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> internet is a socio-technical</font>

634
00:29:08,239 --> 00:29:13,009
system<font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is just looking at structure</font>

635
00:29:11,119 --> 00:29:15,589
<font color="#E5E5E5">this is ignoring a lot of important</font>

636
00:29:13,009 --> 00:29:18,469
stuff like what goes on over those

637
00:29:15,589 --> 00:29:20,569
connections<font color="#CCCCCC"> so this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is not the whole</font>

638
00:29:18,469 --> 00:29:21,469
story<font color="#E5E5E5"> but i think it's an important part</font>

639
00:29:20,569 --> 00:29:25,069
of the story

640
00:29:21,469 --> 00:29:27,499
ok so now moving on<font color="#CCCCCC"> i just want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to kind</font>

641
00:29:25,069 --> 00:29:29,209
of give a shout out to some of the other

pretty cool

<font color="#E5E5E5">the the basic idea comes from this</font>

observation that

<font color="#CCCCCC">in human social networks</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we tend to be</font>

connected to a lot of people who are

the six degrees of separation

665
00:30:30,110 --> 00:30:34,189
it's really based on this kind of

theorizing<font color="#CCCCCC"> showing that just by adding a</font>

we can start improving the state of

censorship on the internet you know

755
00:34:53,620 --> 00:35:00,009
right now we have a lot of companies

756
00:34:56,230 --> 00:35:03,490
that are keeping users data on the cloud

757
00:35:00,010 --> 00:35:06,220
in these data silos that create a huge

00:36:04,090 --> 00:36:14,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">i think i've got some time for questions</font>

00:36:14,970 --> 00:36:23,549
<font color="#E5E5E5">there a microphone or just use this one</font>

782

<font color="#CCCCCC">ok for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> any file question</font>

are you going to get<font color="#CCCCCC"> ready</font>

784
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:32,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">yeah so that's uh that's one of the</font>

785
00:36:29,790 --> 00:36:35,130
differences<font color="#CCCCCC"> out right</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of course</font>

786
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:39,990
so he says<font color="#CCCCCC"> free net is for static files</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">how how is my proposal different for</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">addressable networks</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so it's really</font>

792
00:36:47,100 --> 00:36:52,589
about storing a particular type of data

00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:53,490
in a way that you know you can retrieve

it later

795
00:36:53,490 --> 00:36:58,560
the proposal<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i described here is</font>

796
00:36:56,760 --> 00:37:02,010
really just about the network so there's

797
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:03,359
no storage layer<font color="#E5E5E5"> so this is just about</font>

798
00:37:02,010 --> 00:37:07,680
the person-to-person communication

799
00:37:03,359 --> 00:37:09,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">they're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not they're not exclusive you</font>

800
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:13,950
can you can use<font color="#CCCCCC"> content addressable</font>

801
00:37:09,630 --> 00:37:15,720
networks to achieve<font color="#CCCCCC"> a person-to-person</font>

802
00:37:13,950 --> 00:37:19,259
communication<font color="#CCCCCC"> but you just have to do it</font>

803
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:25,890
on the application layer<font color="#E5E5E5"> not on the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> knot</font>

804
00:37:19,260 --> 00:37:28,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be network</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> layer in order to have</font>

805
00:37:25,890 --> 00:37:31,680
multiple paths to cross the network that

806
00:37:28,590 --> 00:37:34,650
are therefore reduce the likelihood of

807
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:36,540
attacking the correct one that strikes

808
00:37:34,650 --> 00:37:38,100
me is running into a bit of tension with

809
00:37:36,540 --> 00:37:41,490
the current public internet architecture

835
00:38:44,210 --> 00:38:49,400
should<font color="#E5E5E5"> also mention that there's a</font>

836
00:38:45,980 --> 00:38:52,520
concept of overlay networks where you

837
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:57,890
use<font color="#CCCCCC"> a standard point-to-point tunneling</font>

839
00:38:57,890 --> 00:39:02,509
top of that you build a virtual<font color="#E5E5E5"> network</font>

840
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:05,509
<font color="#E5E5E5">so you assign every note of virtual</font>

859

resources that this cakes and is it

860
00:39:56,500 --> 00:40:00,760
worth using those resources for the one

861
00:39:59,020 --> 00:40:03,009
percent of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> time</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> where when you</font>

863
00:40:03,010 --> 00:40:08,020
that's kind of a challenge of the work

864
00:40:05,110 --> 00:40:11,050
is to find a system that does this

865
00:40:08,020 --> 00:40:14,440
without using too many resources and

866
00:40:11,050 --> 00:40:17,860
probably the main<font color="#CCCCCC"> trade-off there</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is we</font>

867
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:20,890
want<font color="#CCCCCC"> very sparse networks we don't want</font>

868
00:40:17,860 --> 00:40:23,080
each node to have a million connections

869
00:40:20,890 --> 00:40:25,210
because that eats up a lot of resources

870
00:40:23,080 --> 00:40:29,020
memory for routing tables things like

871
00:40:25,210 --> 00:40:30,760
that but we want to be able to leverage

872
00:40:29,020 --> 00:40:31,840
the existing resources in the best

873
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:34,420
possible way

00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:36,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">there's also the kind of you know</font>

876

944
00:43:48,470 --> 00:43:54,399
those criteria are probably

<font color="#CCCCCC">set up set of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> tools yourself</font>

950
00:44:04,940 --> 00:44:10,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">aww</font>

951
00:44:08,140 --> 00:44:12,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">yeah exactly</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so for the first part of</font>

952
00:44:10,840 --> 00:44:14,350
your question<font color="#CCCCCC"> I was gonna say we found</font>

953
00:44:12,460 --> 00:44:19,630
reviewer number<font color="#E5E5E5"> two but you've got my</font>

954
00:44:14,350 --> 00:44:21,160
response already so so he said uh<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

955
00:44:19,630 --> 00:44:22,900
reality a lot of the networks that we

956
00:44:21,160 --> 00:44:24,910
care about<font color="#CCCCCC"> our self-organizing they</font>

957
00:44:22,900 --> 00:44:28,180
follow rules that<font color="#E5E5E5"> aren't necessarily</font>

958
00:44:24,910 --> 00:44:30,970
compatible with the very structured very

959
00:44:28,180 --> 00:44:32,980
regular networks that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I've</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> presented and</font>

960
00:44:30,970 --> 00:44:36,189
that's totally true

961
00:44:32,980 --> 00:44:38,590
so one approach that<font color="#E5E5E5"> which which he</font>

962
00:44:36,190 --> 00:44:40,300
mentioned is you can start to say well

963
00:44:38,590 --> 00:44:44,110
what are the rules we would need to

964
00:44:40,300 --> 00:44:45,850
follow so that we start to build these

965
00:44:44,110 --> 00:44:48,070
types of networks<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that's definitely</font>

966
00:44:45,850 --> 00:44:50,890
one thing that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm actively looking into</font>

967
00:44:48,070 --> 00:44:55,750
my<font color="#E5E5E5"> in my research and then the the other</font>

968
00:44:50,890 --> 00:44:57,370
the other answer<font color="#CCCCCC"> to that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is right now</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

969
00:44:55,750 --> 00:45:01,120
build our networks<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a self-organized</font>

970
00:44:57,370 --> 00:45:02,560
way<font color="#E5E5E5"> but it may be the case that we want</font>

971
00:45:01,120 --> 00:45:04,720
to build some networks in a more

972
00:45:02,560 --> 00:45:07,600
deliberate way in the kind of example<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

973
00:45:04,720 --> 00:45:10,209
talked<font color="#CCCCCC"> about with organizations of</font>

00:45:07,600 --> 00:45:13,450
libraries<font color="#E5E5E5"> hackerspaces working together</font>

975
00:45:10,210 --> 00:45:16,240
we have a<font color="#CCCCCC"> power grid why why can't we</font>

976
00:45:13,450 --> 00:45:18,790
have a trust grid<font color="#CCCCCC"> this is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> something that</font>

977
00:45:16,240 --> 00:45:20,470
it might be worth having<font color="#E5E5E5"> if it if it</font>

978
00:45:18,790 --> 00:45:23,859
gives us something that we didn't have

979
00:45:20,470 --> 00:45:25,899
before

980
00:45:23,859 --> 00:45:28,058
<font color="#CCCCCC">yeah I have a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> question about the trade</font>

981
00:45:25,900 --> 00:45:30,160
of between the<font color="#E5E5E5"> speed of light get</font>

982
00:45:28,059 --> 00:45:32,289

00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:34,569
<font color="#CCCCCC">resilient</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> oils</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so you look like a lot</font>

about a lot of like to my<font color="#E5E5E5"> mind is very</font>

992
00:45:49,779 --> 00:45:52,989
tried building any of these but it's

993
00:45:51,579 --> 00:45:54,430
definitely the case with the ones that

994
00:45:52,989 --> 00:45:57,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">I've seen out there you know</font>

on finding ways to<font color="#E5E5E5"> trade off</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sorry</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

997
00:46:01,720 --> 00:46:05,980
question<font color="#E5E5E5"> was about the trade-off between</font>

1001
00:46:10,569 --> 00:46:16,058
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> so there's some theoretical</font>

1002
00:46:13,839 --> 00:46:18,609
research on how do you achieve that

1003
00:46:16,059 --> 00:46:21,069
<font color="#E5E5E5">trade-off</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and then there's also more</font>

1004
00:46:18,609 --> 00:46:24,279
practical engineering based research on

1005

you know how do you optimize and<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

temper

1008
00:46:28,180 --> 00:46:40,049
<font color="#CCCCCC">ok get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a couple more questions</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">points</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to this</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">this</font>

1014
00:46:58,789 --> 00:47:04,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">ok so the question was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in this partial</font>

1015
00:47:01,249 --> 00:47:06,979
trust model<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I've simplified</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

untrusted region to a number of paths

1017
00:47:06,979 --> 00:47:12,769
with a single node and the argument was

1018
00:47:10,489 --> 00:47:16,849
some<font color="#E5E5E5"> notes</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sometimes will have multiple</font>

1019
00:47:12,769 --> 00:47:21,049
nodes which will have more more possible

1020
00:47:16,849 --> 00:47:22,699
chances for<font color="#CCCCCC"> a male to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> compromise those</font>

1021
00:47:21,049 --> 00:47:23,299
nodes so you might want to prefer short

1022
00:47:22,699 --> 00:47:26,900
notes

1023
00:47:23,299 --> 00:47:29,359
well<font color="#CCCCCC"> so that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> true if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> mail doesn't know</font>

1024
00:47:26,900 --> 00:47:31,969
the structure of the network<font color="#CCCCCC"> it smells</font>

1025
00:47:29,359 --> 00:47:33,348
<font color="#CCCCCC">just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> compromising notes randomly</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm</font>

1026
00:47:31,969 --> 00:47:36,019
actually choosing an even more

1027
00:47:33,349 --> 00:47:38,089
adversarial model so i'm being my own

1028
00:47:36,019 --> 00:47:39,799
enemy here and saying<font color="#CCCCCC"> well knows the</font>

00:47:38,089 --> 00:47:43,038
structure of the network<font color="#CCCCCC"> male knows</font>

1030
00:47:39,799 --> 00:47:46,339
which nodes to compromise<font color="#E5E5E5"> so that she</font>

1031
00:47:43,039 --> 00:47:47,869
only have to do one<font color="#CCCCCC"> per</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> path and all of</font>

1032
00:47:46,339 --> 00:47:49,578
the results that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I've presented still</font>

1033
00:47:47,869 --> 00:47:56,600
hold in that kind of really pessimistic

1034
00:47:49,579 --> 00:47:58,130
case

1035
00:47:56,600 --> 00:48:00,558
<font color="#E5E5E5">which</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> would</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> already</font>

1036
00:47:58,130 --> 00:48:02,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">right unless you're directly connected</font>

1037
00:48:00,559 --> 00:48:06,410
to someone or you share<font color="#CCCCCC"> trust</font>

1038
00:48:02,210 --> 00:48:07,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">neighborhoods</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you made the simplifying</font>

1039
00:48:06,410 --> 00:48:10,788
assumption that you have this sort of

1040
00:48:07,970 --> 00:48:13,098
just basically distinct<font color="#CCCCCC"> paths but really</font>

1041
00:48:10,789 --> 00:48:16,940
you have this kind of big mesh<font color="#E5E5E5"> full of</font>

1042
00:48:13,099 --> 00:48:18,619
stuff and so somehow you are like a<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

1043
00:48:16,940 --> 00:48:20,809
writing a message to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> it has</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to kind</font>

1044
00:48:18,619 --> 00:48:23,450
of pick out a bunch of nodes in the

1045
00:48:20,809 --> 00:48:26,269
middle to create these independent paths

1046
00:48:23,450 --> 00:48:27,618
how do you sort of avoid that being

1047
00:48:26,269 --> 00:48:29,359
compromised how do you even get a

1048
00:48:27,619 --> 00:48:31,759
picture of the network in the middle<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1049
00:48:29,359 --> 00:48:33,348
<font color="#CCCCCC">save which is your past perfect question</font>

1050
00:48:31,759 --> 00:48:36,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">and really glad you asked that</font>

1051
00:48:33,349 --> 00:48:39,319
so the question was in this model we

1052
00:48:36,500 --> 00:48:41,960
just have some paths and<font color="#CCCCCC"> alice</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is just</font>

1053
00:48:39,319 --> 00:48:44,029
choosing some of those paths<font color="#CCCCCC"> from the</font>

1054
00:48:41,960 --> 00:48:46,160
question<font color="#CCCCCC"> was how does else know in the</font>

1055
00:48:44,029 --> 00:48:49,039
real<font color="#CCCCCC"> network and more</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> complicated one</font>

1056
00:48:46,160 --> 00:48:51,109
how does<font color="#CCCCCC"> Ellis</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know which nodes to send</font>

1057
00:48:49,039 --> 00:48:53,269
those paths<font color="#E5E5E5"> how to route the messages</font>

1058
00:48:51,109 --> 00:48:55,130
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's that's a real kind of</font>

1059
00:48:53,269 --> 00:48:58,308
challenge in this in this type of work

1060
00:48:55,130 --> 00:49:01,549
and some of the work that<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm doing is</font>

1061
00:48:58,309 --> 00:49:03,380
on finding<font color="#E5E5E5"> routing algorithms that do</font>

00:49:01,549 --> 00:49:07,309
exactly that<font color="#E5E5E5"> so it's not straightforward</font>

1073
00:49:31,609 --> 00:49:35,839
here and then you just go like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

1074
00:49:34,759 --> 00:49:37,640
there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's a natural routing</font>

1076
00:49:37,640 --> 00:49:43,519
extends that to multipath routing

1077

algorithms that actually generates a<font color="#CCCCCC"> 22</font>
