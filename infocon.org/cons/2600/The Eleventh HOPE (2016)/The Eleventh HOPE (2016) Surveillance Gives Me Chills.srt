of our store for folks here in the

some other researchers have been doing

of the biggest questions in the

surveillance world is the fundamental

15
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:49,500
question that we get asked all the time

16
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:50,640
which is<font color="#CCCCCC"> do people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> actually care and the</font>

17
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:53,100
research that<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'll be talking about</font>

18
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:55,140
today is an attempt to get a part of

19
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:57,660
that question<font color="#CCCCCC"> so part of the</font>

20
00:00:55,140 --> 00:01:00,539
preconception<font color="#E5E5E5"> is that maybe people don't</font>

21
00:00:57,660 --> 00:01:03,300
care<font color="#CCCCCC"> maybe people are ignorant maybe</font>

00:01:00,539 --> 00:01:04,890
people are<font color="#CCCCCC"> able at a pathetic maybe</font>

23
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:09,210
people have other shit to deal with

24
00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:12,270
frankly and particularly there is a

25
00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:16,139
stereotype about young people like Becky

26
00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:20,250
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> a good hair over here that maybe</font>

27
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:22,950
they just lay it all out online<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

28
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:26,310
maybe we can interpret that as being

29
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:28,829
that they are happy to have law

30
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:32,189
enforcement have access to the data that

31
00:01:28,829 --> 00:01:35,579
they put online and use it against them

32
00:01:32,189 --> 00:01:39,990
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm more than a little bit skeptical</font>

33
00:01:35,579 --> 00:01:42,419
of this stereotype but when<font color="#CCCCCC"> i started</font>

off<font color="#E5E5E5"> this research project which was</font>

there would not be a<font color="#E5E5E5"> a measurable</font>

41
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:02,130
was something that researchers had a lot

00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:04,350
of problems in identifying and

43
00:02:02,130 --> 00:02:06,298
quantifying before the advantage of the

44
00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:09,329
Snowden revelations is that they

the answer is agriculture<font color="#E5E5E5"> we think that</font>

98
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:42,400
perhaps this is because the DHS is

concerned

00:09:15,470 --> 00:09:19,460
media surveillance to come and listen

196
00:09:17,810 --> 00:09:22,760
even to me about social media

197
00:09:19,460 --> 00:09:26,000
surveillance<font color="#CCCCCC"> nobody got six out of six</font>

198
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:28,970
right and this poses<font color="#E5E5E5"> interesting</font>

199
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:31,010
questions is to the legibility of these

200
00:09:28,970 --> 00:09:33,740
systems to the general public

201
00:09:31,010 --> 00:09:35,569
if we don't know if we cannot tell what

202
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:39,050
the government is really interested in

203
00:09:35,570 --> 00:09:40,880
then there's going to be a mismatch and

204
00:09:39,050 --> 00:09:43,969
an inability for us to tailor our

205
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:45,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">behavior or</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> tailored searches to deal</font>

206
00:09:43,970 --> 00:09:48,470
with the phenomenon of mass government

207
00:09:45,530 --> 00:09:49,640
surveillance and that to an extent is

208
00:09:48,470 --> 00:09:51,740
going to be intentional because

209
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:53,900
government agencies frequently expect

210
00:09:51,740 --> 00:09:57,560
expressed that they do not want people

211
00:09:53,900 --> 00:10:00,230
to be trying to evade<font color="#E5E5E5"> massive n systems</font>

212
00:09:57,560 --> 00:10:04,489
by tailoring what they do<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> express</font>

213
00:10:00,230 --> 00:10:06,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">online so we're going with that in mind</font>

214
00:10:04,490 --> 00:10:09,440
that there is that mismatch there

215
00:10:06,530 --> 00:10:13,520
we're going to go into three research

216
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:15,230
papers that are recent papers that<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

worth taking a look at in this context

00:23:17,929 --> 00:23:22,159
social media monitoring there was a

<font color="#E5E5E5">12-man SWAT team rounded his house</font>

you to say yes here<font color="#CCCCCC"> and so he let the</font>

storage of firearms<font color="#CCCCCC"> that is not the</font>

537
00:23:58,250 --> 00:24:07,490
interesting part<font color="#CCCCCC"> 1 interesting element</font>

538
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:09,409
of this is that the charges were dropped

539
00:24:07,490 --> 00:24:10,789
in exchange for Travis and his

540
00:24:09,409 --> 00:24:12,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">girlfriend setting up the comic</font>

541
00:24:10,789 --> 00:24:13,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">bookstore setting up their home and</font>

542
00:24:12,230 --> 00:24:15,380
moving out of state so he now lives in

543
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:16,010
<font color="#CCCCCC">hat New Hampshire because live free or</font>

544
00:24:15,380 --> 00:24:20,600
die

545
00:24:16,010 --> 00:24:25,490
the other interesting part is that this

546
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:28,730
case was used by<font color="#E5E5E5"> the DHS</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> funded fusion</font>

547
00:24:25,490 --> 00:24:30,650

548
00:24:28,730 --> 00:24:36,679
legislators about why they are doing

549
00:24:30,650 --> 00:24:38,570

00:30:57,419 --> 00:31:02,460

690
00:31:02,460 --> 00:31:09,690
something to be exceedingly cautious of

691
00:31:05,130 --> 00:31:12,210
as a pattern and my personal opinion

692
00:31:09,690 --> 00:31:16,860
here is that we cannot allow governments

693
00:31:12,210 --> 00:31:19,080
to work with social media companies or

694

00:52:19,040 --> 00:52:24,320
