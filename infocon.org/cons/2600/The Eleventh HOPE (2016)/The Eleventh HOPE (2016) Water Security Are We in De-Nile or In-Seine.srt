this was during the rainy season<font color="#E5E5E5"> so that</font>

134
00:06:16,950 --> 00:06:21,690
pond has water in the dry season<font color="#E5E5E5"> it will</font>

135
00:06:20,010 --> 00:06:25,169
not have water so the children will have

136
00:06:21,690 --> 00:06:28,740
to walk even farther to get water<font color="#CCCCCC"> from</font>

137
00:06:25,169 --> 00:06:32,340
the pond is not a clean protected water

138
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:36,780
source and

139
00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:37,530
it has sediment in it<font color="#E5E5E5"> it has a bacteria</font>

140
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:39,929
in it

141
00:06:37,530 --> 00:06:41,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">god</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> knows what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> else it has in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it I</font>

142
00:06:39,930 --> 00:06:44,760
didn't personally<font color="#CCCCCC"> tested while i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was</font>

143
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:47,070
there<font color="#CCCCCC"> but i'd like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to tell you just a</font>

144
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:50,039
little story that happened at one of the

145
00:06:47,070 --> 00:06:51,810
workshops that<font color="#CCCCCC"> i was at</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in fact this was</font>

146
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:55,560
a workshop that happened at that town

147
00:06:51,810 --> 00:06:58,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">but it is not a story about that town so</font>

148
00:06:55,560 --> 00:07:02,430
we had a workshop to teach people how to

149
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:05,430
use this new system that was developed

150
00:07:02,430 --> 00:07:09,900
at one of our hackathons<font color="#E5E5E5"> called tarif</font>

151
00:07:05,430 --> 00:07:13,800
excuse me<font color="#CCCCCC"> Teresa and the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> idea behind</font>

152
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:15,659
<font color="#E5E5E5">this is that a citizen has a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> cell phone</font>

153
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:17,160
everybody<font color="#E5E5E5"> has cell phones that use</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> cell</font>

154
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:19,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">phones for their</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> banking for paying for</font>

155
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:22,350
things<font color="#CCCCCC"> so if you see a broken water</font>

156
00:07:19,950 --> 00:07:26,039
point like that one up there<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can</font>

157
00:07:22,350 --> 00:07:28,110
send a message using<font color="#E5E5E5"> USS d which is</font>

158
00:07:26,039 --> 00:07:29,880
basically the same protocol that lap

159
00:07:28,110 --> 00:07:32,220
goes over

160
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:33,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">um you send a message and you say this</font>

161
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:36,210
water point is broken it says which

162
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:38,400
water point is broken<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it gives you</font>

163
00:07:36,210 --> 00:07:41,070
options and then you pick the number for

164
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:45,090
the water point and then it says<font color="#E5E5E5"> how is</font>

165
00:07:41,070 --> 00:07:46,680
it broken is it a muddy water is it not

166
00:07:45,090 --> 00:07:48,479
working at all

167
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:50,729
what's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the thing so you would answer the</font>

168
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:52,919
questions<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and then after this little</font>

169
00:07:50,729 --> 00:07:54,930
session that goes back and forth<font color="#CCCCCC"> it says</font>

170
00:07:52,919 --> 00:08:00,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">thank you very much for your report</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> yay</font>

171
00:07:54,930 --> 00:08:02,610
and then that goes into a<font color="#E5E5E5"> a database</font>

172
00:08:00,270 --> 00:08:05,760
system that allows the community

173
00:08:02,610 --> 00:08:08,760
organized<font color="#E5E5E5"> water service organizations</font>

174
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:10,620
and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> district water engineers to see</font>

175
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:12,810
what's happening what's broken

176
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:14,610
what's fixed they can send people out

177
00:08:12,810 --> 00:08:16,979
they can track how long it takes to get

178
00:08:14,610 --> 00:08:20,550
things fixed<font color="#E5E5E5"> so we are having this a</font>

179
00:08:16,979 --> 00:08:24,330
workshop to teach the people how to use

180
00:08:20,550 --> 00:08:26,880
this tool and we had a<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lull</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in the</font>

181
00:08:24,330 --> 00:08:29,880
workshop so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> asked for stories what</font>

182
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:32,669
happens when your water point is broken

183
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:34,770
and there were a bunch of people that

184
00:08:32,669 --> 00:08:37,409
stood up and you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> explained things</font>

185
00:08:34,770 --> 00:08:39,809
and one of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> gentleman stood up and he</font>

186
00:08:37,409 --> 00:08:41,919
said well we really don't have any

187
00:08:39,809 --> 00:08:43,718
problem we we don't need public

188
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:46,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">the points that much because we live</font>

189
00:08:43,719 --> 00:08:49,750
right next to Lake Victoria<font color="#CCCCCC"> so we have</font>

190
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:52,449
lots of clean water available to us

191
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:55,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">the only problem is that every so often</font>

192
00:08:52,450 --> 00:08:58,660
somebody gets eaten by a crocodile<font color="#CCCCCC"> every</font>

193
00:08:55,630 --> 00:09:02,290
so often<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know we don't need a public</font>

194
00:08:58,660 --> 00:09:05,019
water point so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i came away</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> from</font>

195
00:09:02,290 --> 00:09:09,790
that just feeling absolutely shocked

196
00:09:05,019 --> 00:09:12,040
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> um it was so difficult to deal with</font>

197
00:09:09,790 --> 00:09:14,769
the bureaucracy of getting your water

198
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:16,810
point fixed and<font color="#E5E5E5"> and maintained that</font>

199
00:09:14,769 --> 00:09:19,990
people would prefer to you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

200
00:09:16,810 --> 00:09:24,099
sacrifice<font color="#E5E5E5"> a few random people to the</font>

201
00:09:19,990 --> 00:09:28,060
crocodiles in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> the need to get their</font>

202
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:30,850
water<font color="#E5E5E5"> so um</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like to take a</font>

203
00:09:28,060 --> 00:09:34,180
moment to talk about sewer systems<font color="#CCCCCC"> do</font>

204
00:09:30,850 --> 00:09:37,810
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> wanna this is a sewer system in</font>

205
00:09:34,180 --> 00:09:42,069
<font color="#CCCCCC">Tanzania and funny enough the world bank</font>

206
00:09:37,810 --> 00:09:45,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">but thinks that open sewage systems are</font>

207
00:09:42,070 --> 00:09:48,100
an acceptable thing to fund<font color="#E5E5E5"> be at bio</font>

208
00:09:45,670 --> 00:09:52,089
digesters and certain other maintenance

209
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:54,339
on infrastructure and as you can tell

210
00:09:52,089 --> 00:09:56,079
<font color="#E5E5E5">anytime you have an open sewage system</font>

211
00:09:54,339 --> 00:09:59,110
like this series a bunch of nastiness

212
00:09:56,079 --> 00:10:01,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">that is going to occur and there are</font>

213
00:09:59,110 --> 00:10:03,610
really a lot of people that<font color="#E5E5E5"> died because</font>

214
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:06,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">of the unclean water there's even</font>

215
00:10:03,610 --> 00:10:07,870
blindness parasites<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's all the nasty</font>

216
00:10:06,430 --> 00:10:09,910
stuff that you never wanted to think

217
00:10:07,870 --> 00:10:15,910
about ever in your life

218
00:10:09,910 --> 00:10:19,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">yes also that these open sewers it's</font>

219
00:10:15,910 --> 00:10:23,529
untreated water<font color="#CCCCCC"> it goes back into</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> river</font>

220
00:10:19,630 --> 00:10:27,610
systems that then goes back into the

221
00:10:23,529 --> 00:10:30,850
water that people are<font color="#E5E5E5"> picking up right</font>

222
00:10:27,610 --> 00:10:32,769
<font color="#E5E5E5">so so remember the sixty percent of</font>

223
00:10:30,850 --> 00:10:34,510
people who should have access to clean

224
00:10:32,769 --> 00:10:36,069
water who<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't plus all of the people</font>

225
00:10:34,510 --> 00:10:38,260
who just don't have access to clean

226
00:10:36,069 --> 00:10:41,110
water there go going to get their water

227
00:10:38,260 --> 00:10:43,839
from whatever water source source is

228
00:10:41,110 --> 00:10:47,019
handy if<font color="#E5E5E5"> theres a river and the water</font>

229
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:49,149
doesn't look absolutely disgusting

230
00:10:47,019 --> 00:10:50,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">they're getting that water and you would</font>

231
00:10:49,149 --> 00:10:54,230
be surprised at

232
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:57,710
not disgusting<font color="#E5E5E5"> sewer waters rushing down</font>

233
00:10:54,230 --> 00:11:00,260
a basically a stream in the middle of

234
00:10:57,710 --> 00:11:03,440
town can look<font color="#CCCCCC"> I mean it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it might smell</font>

235
00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:05,990
bad<font color="#E5E5E5"> but it doesn't necessarily look bad</font>

236
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:09,170
no<font color="#E5E5E5"> no and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and people do get their water</font>

237
00:11:05,990 --> 00:11:11,060
from those<font color="#CCCCCC"> know but also</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> enters the</font>

238
00:11:09,170 --> 00:11:13,790
agriculture and also the food supply

<font color="#CCCCCC">hitting</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they fish or anything</font>

240
00:11:13,790 --> 00:11:18,709
like that so it just spreads the<font color="#E5E5E5"> pain</font>

241
00:11:16,010 --> 00:11:20,630
around<font color="#E5E5E5"> so luckily this is only a problem</font>

242
00:11:18,710 --> 00:11:22,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">in Africa</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> right absolutely</font>

243
00:11:20,630 --> 00:11:23,930
only a problem in<font color="#E5E5E5"> Africa would never</font>

244
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:26,030
happen in<font color="#CCCCCC"> a developed nation like the</font>

418
00:19:04,530 --> 00:19:08,670
that when this was all big in the news

also the<font color="#E5E5E5"> the town of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Flint is actually</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">bacteria wow</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that's just a nasty one</font>

532
00:24:09,309 --> 00:24:13,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">i'm sure many</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of you have heard of</font>

533
00:24:11,470 --> 00:24:15,760
something called<font color="#CCCCCC"> Colorado of course</font>

534
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:18,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">other things like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> legionella by the way</font>

535
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:20,799
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> we do have chlorine in our water and</font>

536
00:24:18,820 --> 00:24:22,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's supposed to kill off the bacteria</font>

537
00:24:20,799 --> 00:24:26,710
but it doesn't kill off all of the

538
00:24:22,210 --> 00:24:30,130
bacteria and some some areas put in a

539
00:24:26,710 --> 00:24:32,679
less chlorine<font color="#CCCCCC"> so you're gonna have a</font>

540
00:24:30,130 --> 00:24:35,530
higher chance of having the<font color="#E5E5E5"> bacteria</font>

541
00:24:32,679 --> 00:24:39,909
<font color="#CCCCCC">you've also got a bacteria that are just</font>

542
00:24:35,530 --> 00:24:42,158
becoming<font color="#CCCCCC"> essentially an immune to the</font>

543
00:24:39,909 --> 00:24:44,169
alcohol and the chlorine and the

544
00:24:42,159 --> 00:24:47,110
antibiotics and everything else

545
00:24:44,169 --> 00:24:49,539
yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> and and so that creates more of a</font>

546
00:24:47,110 --> 00:24:52,539
problem so in some cities they put even

547
00:24:49,539 --> 00:24:54,820
more chlorine into their water so then

548
00:24:52,539 --> 00:24:57,158
the water coming out of here<font color="#E5E5E5"> speak it</font>

549
00:24:54,820 --> 00:24:59,500
kind of smells like a swimming pool<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

550
00:24:57,159 --> 00:25:01,330
that's not very good for you either<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

551
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:02,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">and by</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the way we do not use chlorine</font>

552
00:25:01,330 --> 00:25:04,090
<font color="#CCCCCC">and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> water system in the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Netherlands</font>

553
00:25:02,830 --> 00:25:07,210
because we don't have to

00:25:04,090 --> 00:25:08,740
it comes in<font color="#E5E5E5"> through pure and clean</font>

555
00:25:07,210 --> 00:25:09,970
another thing that there's a problem

00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:12,039
<font color="#E5E5E5">within the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> United States</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there are</font>

00:25:09,970 --> 00:25:13,150
absolutely no regulations to filter the

558
00:25:12,039 --> 00:25:15,700
water enough to remove the

559
00:25:13,150 --> 00:25:17,919
pharmaceutical waste products out of it

560
00:25:15,700 --> 00:25:20,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">so when you take chemotherapy</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> drugs that</font>

some of those chemo drugs

well as birth control or cocaine or

565
00:25:27,820 --> 00:25:32,139

00:25:48,909 --> 00:25:53,049
many of these drugs that we take don't

574

actually get metabolized by our body<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

575
00:25:53,049 --> 00:25:57,400
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just going straight into the water</font>

it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not only just the water that you're</font>

funding it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

on the planet why don't we take it over

648

excuse me<font color="#E5E5E5"> and some people think that if</font>

you have a social enterprise that

additional projects but she's taking

those projects on with her

938
00:43:11,660 --> 00:43:17,000
so here<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm focusing specifically on the</font>

939
00:43:14,300 --> 00:43:19,190
projects that we've continued to be

940
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:21,980
involved with over the last two years

<font color="#E5E5E5">at that hackathon it was running the</font>

949
00:43:45,170 --> 00:43:52,369
<font color="#E5E5E5">then we went back to the drawing board</font>

950
00:43:48,380 --> 00:43:57,710
we did a bunch of new things and it was

951

956
00:44:07,550 --> 00:44:14,780

is this project with the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Kofun community</font>

960
00:44:21,140 --> 00:44:28,609
in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Amazon jungle they have about a</font>

964
00:44:33,800 --> 00:44:38,360
and it's pretty nasty<font color="#E5E5E5"> and when we first</font>

965
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:40,760
started communicating with them it was

966
00:44:38,360 --> 00:44:44,000
all about water quality issues<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's</font>

967
00:44:40,760 --> 00:44:48,260
kind of grown the project around<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

968
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:53,720
has grown to touch<font color="#E5E5E5"> educational issues</font>

969
00:44:48,260 --> 00:44:56,570
and bringing in power<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

970
00:44:53,720 --> 00:44:58,310
sustainable and doesn't involve the

971
00:44:56,570 --> 00:45:01,940
petroleum companies and things like that

972
00:44:58,310 --> 00:45:05,540
but the water quality issue is still key

973
00:45:01,940 --> 00:45:08,900
to that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then this other project</font>

974
00:45:05,540 --> 00:45:15,410
called<font color="#E5E5E5"> aguas con</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 2012 Sagwa which is a</font>

975
00:45:08,900 --> 00:45:18,410
project from<font color="#CCCCCC"> Guatemala</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that a basically</font>

976
00:45:15,410 --> 00:45:21,500
it has two pieces one is a piece that

977
00:45:18,410 --> 00:45:24,680
allows the public to test water

978
00:45:21,500 --> 00:45:28,190
themselves with these testing kits and

979
00:45:24,680 --> 00:45:30,859
then track<font color="#CCCCCC"> what the quality of the water</font>

980
00:45:28,190 --> 00:45:33,890
where they are is<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the other piece of</font>

981
00:45:30,859 --> 00:45:37,580
it is sort of a water education piece

982
00:45:33,890 --> 00:45:39,920
that tells the general community this is

983
00:45:37,580 --> 00:45:41,509
what's going on with your water<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe</font>

984
00:45:39,920 --> 00:45:43,100
this water that you didn't trust as much

985
00:45:41,510 --> 00:45:44,660
cleaner than you thought

986
00:45:43,100 --> 00:45:47,000
and maybe this water that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> did trust</font>

987
00:45:44,660 --> 00:45:49,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">as much</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> worse</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> than you thought</font>

988
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:51,240
so that's a really neat project<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think</font>

989
00:45:49,100 --> 00:45:55,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">that each of these projects</font>

990
00:45:51,240 --> 00:45:57,689
<font color="#E5E5E5">inform each other and have a lot to</font>

991
00:45:55,290 --> 00:45:59,160
bring to the table in terms of helping

992
00:45:57,690 --> 00:46:00,750
us think about some of these other

993
00:45:59,160 --> 00:46:03,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">product of problems that we've been</font>

994
00:46:00,750 --> 00:46:06,900
talking about today<font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think that we</font>

995
00:46:03,060 --> 00:46:10,200
can do a whole lot more

996
00:46:06,900 --> 00:46:14,670
so what do we want to do now<font color="#CCCCCC"> take over</font>

997
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:17,160
the world of course<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right so uh</font>

998
00:46:14,670 --> 00:46:18,720
trying to use technology responsible

999
00:46:17,160 --> 00:46:20,970
it's one of these things where you know

1000
00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:22,439
<font color="#CCCCCC">patents</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and IP and so forth but we're</font>

1001
00:46:20,970 --> 00:46:23,970
dealing with human beings that need

1002
00:46:22,440 --> 00:46:25,680
water

1003
00:46:23,970 --> 00:46:27,330
you don't want to have to pay for

1004
00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:29,250
license before you fill up your cup

1005
00:46:27,330 --> 00:46:30,869
right there and then<font color="#CCCCCC"> sign</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> an NDA to make</font>

1006
00:46:29,250 --> 00:46:34,230

1007
00:46:30,869 --> 00:46:35,850
test it yourself to tell the results<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

1008
00:46:34,230 --> 00:46:38,250
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be able to spread that knowledge</font>

00:46:39,660 --> 00:46:44,759
stuff better<font color="#E5E5E5"> because I think all of you</font>

know that there are problems we can do

1021
00:47:09,300 --> 00:47:13,470
something about it and we can pressure

1022
00:47:11,250 --> 00:47:15,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">our local governments to say listen why</font>

1023

are we testing for you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know materials</font>

00:47:18,420 --> 00:47:24,090
we can get things change but we need to

your local government or if you have

1030
00:47:30,720 --> 00:47:35,580
well water<font color="#CCCCCC"> it only costs about thirty</font>

1031
00:47:33,090 --> 00:47:38,280
dollars to pick up what's called a water

1034
00:47:41,369 --> 00:47:46,410
key things so that you can take that

00:47:43,440 --> 00:47:49,710
information and go hey you know do<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

take that job someplace else

could use the support of the accelerator
