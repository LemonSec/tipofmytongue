to control people the power to control

00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:53,398
really important to talk about you know

48
00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:54,810
the communities were coming from here

53
00:02:00,329 --> 00:02:04,439
yeah so<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was an interesting area to</font>

54
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:06,329
think about privacy issues and<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font>

58
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:13,730
of cases where

59
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:15,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">actavis in seattle have come out in</font>

supremacy is a really serious problem

69
00:02:32,329 --> 00:02:37,790
so as soon as surveillance and privacy

70
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,379
issues start reaching into<font color="#CCCCCC"> some context</font>

really quickly<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm i don't think this</font>

should come as any big surprise

79
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:56,869
um but you know especially when you

80
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:59,899
think about<font color="#E5E5E5"> somewhere like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> seattle where</font>

84
00:03:03,379 --> 00:03:07,250
is that these arguments against

85
00:03:05,930 --> 00:03:10,099

86
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:12,560

00:03:10,099 --> 00:03:14,268
more exacerbated for these marginalized

89
00:03:14,269 --> 00:03:18,530
falling by the sideline<font color="#CCCCCC"> because they</font>

90
00:03:16,069 --> 00:03:20,298
don't get the same type of support and

they don't get the same type of<font color="#CCCCCC"> air time</font>

all of this also seems like the tip of

that we don't know about the police

like jumping to adopt new tools we've

like<font color="#E5E5E5"> the criminal defense bar you were</font>

262
00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:02,700
of the most crucial issues in the

263
00:10:00,510 --> 00:10:05,580
surveillance context is that the current

264
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:07,050
surveillance climate on<font color="#CCCCCC"> create a set of</font>

265
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:08,820
circumstances where it sits next to

266
00:10:07,050 --> 00:10:10,620
impossible as a criminal defendant to

267
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:12,420
get adequate representation<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you're</font>

268
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:14,160
being charged with a crime and there's

269
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:17,160
kind of two fundamental reasons for this

270
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:18,630
the first is the the obfuscation<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

271
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:20,490
police departments are engaging in to

272
00:10:18,630 --> 00:10:23,070
prevent the public from knowing about

273
00:10:20,490 --> 00:10:25,620
these types of surveillance activities

274
00:10:23,070 --> 00:10:27,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">so not only is this kind of kept out of</font>

275
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:28,860
the the field of view the general public

defense attorneys might see and let them

know hey this thing was used this is how

it works

these are some of the legal challenges

you might raise and here's<font color="#E5E5E5"> like all the</font>

um can you explain what's going on and

00:11:43,069 --> 00:11:46,309
like these people<font color="#E5E5E5"> were being told</font>

317
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:47,720
entirely different stories for how the

time on<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so the second problem here</font>

322
00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:57,349
<font color="#E5E5E5">right obviously building upon this first</font>

323
00:11:55,759 --> 00:11:59,360
one is that many of these criminal

324
00:11:57,350 --> 00:12:01,519
defense attorneys lack the<font color="#E5E5E5"> the expertise</font>

to really understand this stuff<font color="#CCCCCC"> even the</font>

00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:05,540
stuff that's pretty well explained<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">in public knowledge like stingrays</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> even</font>

00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:10,399
some of these criminal defense attorneys

330
00:12:08,299 --> 00:12:11,929
to mount a good defense to this much

331
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:15,439
less to<font color="#E5E5E5"> find you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know expert witnesses</font>

332
00:12:11,929 --> 00:12:17,329
<font color="#CCCCCC">are people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that can come in and so you</font>

333
00:12:15,439 --> 00:12:18,799
know this is a really really serious

334
00:12:17,329 --> 00:12:20,420
problem because the the forefront of

335
00:12:18,799 --> 00:12:22,730
these types of technologies are these

336
00:12:20,420 --> 00:12:24,259
these these criminal cases where you

337
00:12:22,730 --> 00:12:26,689
know these people are being charged with

338
00:12:24,259 --> 00:12:29,269
drug crimes you know or routine you know

339
00:12:26,689 --> 00:12:30,469
<font color="#E5E5E5">your property crimes and they're not</font>

340
00:12:29,269 --> 00:12:31,939
able to mount a good<font color="#E5E5E5"> defense and of</font>

341
00:12:30,470 --> 00:12:33,350
course this is magnified if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're</font>

342
00:12:31,939 --> 00:12:34,699
someone that<font color="#CCCCCC"> can afford your own lawyer</font>

345
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:39,889
restrictions are still in play but

346
00:12:38,179 --> 00:12:41,779
there's also problems where<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know</font>

347
00:12:39,889 --> 00:12:43,069
public defense attorneys typically don't

348
00:12:41,779 --> 00:12:44,480
have a whole lot of time to dedicate<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

349
00:12:43,069 --> 00:12:45,589
cases so they're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be able to</font>

350
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:48,230
get up to speed on<font color="#CCCCCC"> this stuff anyway</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">even if the resources are available so</font>

get that before and a lot of departments

357
00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:05,910
don't keep track of this<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so they</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">you might have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a list of users but it's</font>

no one knows how was used in a criminal

363
00:13:15,630 --> 00:13:19,980
defendants may not find out about it at

364
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:21,810
all<font color="#E5E5E5"> and often you see the sharing of</font>

00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:23,370
these tools as well so maybe that in the

366

community that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> believe their</font>

374
00:13:40,290 --> 00:13:45,060

there's a bunch of TV screens on the

<font color="#E5E5E5">lot of flashing lights and like usually</font>

advocates to just be like wait what are

00:20:54,910 --> 00:20:59,920
you doing here<font color="#CCCCCC"> and so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that's and of</font>

584
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:09,219
yeah I think that's working with the

585
00:21:05,530 --> 00:21:11,710
working with activists like many of you

586
00:21:09,220 --> 00:21:12,230
is really important actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> just met</font>

00:21:11,710 --> 00:21:16,370
somebody

588
00:21:12,230 --> 00:21:18,830
who had alerted us to an issue that we

should investigate<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we followed up</font>

with a full<font color="#CCCCCC"> request so yeah</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and then and</font>

591
00:21:23,030 --> 00:21:29,510
then looking journalists who are

local<font color="#CCCCCC"> store</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> procurement notices and see</font>

594
00:21:35,090 --> 00:21:39,320
what we can find but it is really

595
00:21:37,190 --> 00:21:41,240
difficult<font color="#CCCCCC"> i mean there are loopholes in</font>

596
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:45,379
the law that makes it very easy for

597
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:47,150
local police enforcement to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> new</font>

598
00:21:45,380 --> 00:21:50,240
surveillance technologies in ways that

599
00:21:47,150 --> 00:21:52,160
won't show up<font color="#CCCCCC"> on the local notices</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

600
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:53,960
even if it shows up it might be kind of

601
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:54,980
obscure so we might not<font color="#E5E5E5"> realize that</font>

00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:59,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's something that we should be keeping</font>

an eye on<font color="#CCCCCC"> so getting to you in that</font>

604
00:21:59,030 --> 00:22:04,820
first step step of knowing that the

00:22:01,910 --> 00:22:07,309
police agency has a certain type of

606
00:22:04,820 --> 00:22:09,290
technology has been very difficult one

607
00:22:07,309 --> 00:22:11,960
of the challenges of doing this and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

608
00:22:09,290 --> 00:22:13,520
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> Matt</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> alluded to this but um</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:15,410
value<font color="#CCCCCC"> in kind of uncovering this stuff</font>

610
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:16,910
isn't always just in figure out this

611
00:22:15,410 --> 00:22:17,750
piece of technology is being used by

612
00:22:16,910 --> 00:22:20,090
your<font color="#E5E5E5"> police department but also</font>

lot of these resources are coming from

617
00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:28,280
the feds and they often come with

00:22:29,990 --> 00:22:34,940
and so<font color="#E5E5E5"> we had an example</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> where on a</font>

actually a much bigger indictment

00:29:39,399 --> 00:29:43,840

question

886
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:34,470
yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> I was hoping</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you could talk a</font>

887
00:32:33,390 --> 00:32:37,050
little bit more about parallel

00:32:34,470 --> 00:32:39,690
construction and the due process issues

889
00:32:37,050 --> 00:32:42,149
that raises<font color="#CCCCCC"> I found in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> DC talking to a</font>

lot of congressional staffers<font color="#CCCCCC"> who are</font>

891
00:32:42,150 --> 00:32:46,680
more or less willing to sacrifice all of

00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:48,630
our privacy rights for security against

893
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:50,100
mosquito<font color="#E5E5E5"> bites suddenly pause once you</font>

894
00:32:48,630 --> 00:32:51,900
get to the part about parallel

895
00:32:50,100 --> 00:32:54,480
construction and say wait you have

896
00:32:51,900 --> 00:32:57,150
police officers lying in court under

897
00:32:54,480 --> 00:33:01,380
oath about the origins of evidence<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

898
00:32:57,150 --> 00:33:04,290
seems to be perjury on a mass scale on

899
00:33:01,380 --> 00:33:06,270
my question is are you seeing<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

900
00:33:04,290 --> 00:33:08,639
parallel construction in<font color="#CCCCCC"> courts or</font>

evidence<font color="#CCCCCC"> laundering or</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> perjury</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> whatever</font>

902
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:16,650
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to call it at a systemic scale</font>

903
00:33:11,790 --> 00:33:19,470
and if so what is the response to

904
00:33:16,650 --> 00:33:22,950
prosecutors and police officers<font color="#CCCCCC"> seeming</font>

905
00:33:19,470 --> 00:33:24,810
<font color="#CCCCCC">happy to circumvent</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> due process rights</font>

906
00:33:22,950 --> 00:33:28,170
of potentially tens of thousands of

907
00:33:24,810 --> 00:33:30,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">dependence I'd say absolutely systemic</font>

908
00:33:28,170 --> 00:33:31,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">without a doubt on whether you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:33,449
<font color="#CCCCCC">they're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so of course different gradients</font>

910
00:33:31,770 --> 00:33:35,160
of parallel construction you have you

911
00:33:33,450 --> 00:33:37,110
have cases where yes you have a police

912
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:39,270
officer lying in open court<font color="#E5E5E5"> about where</font>

913
00:33:37,110 --> 00:33:41,550
he found a piece of information<font color="#CCCCCC"> you see</font>

00:33:39,270 --> 00:33:44,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">that all the time but then you also have</font>

915
00:33:41,550 --> 00:33:46,560
cases where the police department or the

<font color="#CCCCCC">prosecutor just misleading in math so</font>

917
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:50,280
the classic example this with stingrays

00:33:48,210 --> 00:33:51,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">is on and this took place in Washington</font>

as well as many other places around the

920
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:56,940
country is that you had these<font color="#E5E5E5"> police</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">departments going to judges and saying</font>

a pen register is is a<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a device that</font>

00:34:12,540 --> 00:34:15,779
this time

930
00:34:13,350 --> 00:34:17,489
the call lasted<font color="#CCCCCC"> this long so that type</font>

00:34:15,780 --> 00:34:20,610
of metadata about<font color="#E5E5E5"> landline phone calls</font>

932
00:34:17,489 --> 00:34:21,359
<font color="#E5E5E5">so they were using existing pen register</font>

933
00:34:20,610 --> 00:34:23,460
laws to work

934
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:25,440
request the information collected by a

936
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:29,639
not map to each other but they didn't

937
00:34:27,239 --> 00:34:32,129
bother to clarify this point to<font color="#CCCCCC"> anyone</font>

intentionally by the police<font color="#CCCCCC"> department's</font>

953
00:35:04,260 --> 00:35:07,560
coupled with the fact that a reporter

954
00:35:05,310 --> 00:35:10,320
called him to ask about it led to

955
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:12,420
basically a very very upset judge who

956
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:14,430
got a bunch of other judges very very

957
00:35:12,420 --> 00:35:15,870
upset and change the rules internally

958
00:35:14,430 --> 00:35:17,879
for how they would process these types

959
00:35:15,870 --> 00:35:19,380
of requests but to answer your question

960
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:21,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">you know</font>

963
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:30,150
problems stem from the confidentiality

964
00:35:27,780 --> 00:35:31,980

965
00:35:30,150 --> 00:35:35,340

966
00:35:31,980 --> 00:35:38,670
before getting the stingrays right so we

967
00:35:35,340 --> 00:35:41,220

1054
00:38:54,700 --> 00:38:58,210
good to kind of start some of these

1055

<font color="#CCCCCC">you're going to these meetings and</font>

1211
00:44:38,840 --> 00:44:42,170
thinking about reforms what<font color="#E5E5E5"> are this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> bad</font>

1212
00:44:40,280 --> 00:44:44,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> approach solutions i just talked</font>

1213
00:44:42,170 --> 00:44:46,160
about one solution which is like a local

1214
00:44:44,180 --> 00:44:47,750
legislation that<font color="#E5E5E5"> can be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> passed</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font>

1215
00:44:46,160 --> 00:44:50,990
that's obviously not the only type

1216
00:44:47,750 --> 00:44:52,520
solution so well and I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> a local</font>

1217
00:44:50,990 --> 00:44:55,430
legislation is probably the best

00:44:52,520 --> 00:44:57,080
opportunity to to<font color="#CCCCCC"> combat this thing at</font>

1219
00:44:55,430 --> 00:44:59,629
the local level<font color="#CCCCCC"> I mean of course you</font>

1220

know passing laws at the state level<font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font>

1221
00:44:59,630 --> 00:45:02,330
the federal level kind of restricting

1222
00:45:00,950 --> 00:45:04,910

fundamental important caveat to that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

that's that<font color="#CCCCCC"> if you don't draft that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

legislation very carefully on

1230
00:45:17,420 --> 00:45:21,710
or you kind of don't have the political

1231
00:45:19,400 --> 00:45:24,140
capital to do so<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's opportunities</font>

00:45:24,140 --> 00:45:27,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">obvious one is that while Seattle Police</font>

the feds can still handle the<font color="#CCCCCC"> program</font>

00:46:31,220 --> 00:46:35,209
<font color="#CCCCCC">and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the proceeds</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of those investigations</font>

1268

<font color="#CCCCCC">I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and and kind of work against it at</font>

1270
00:46:38,450 --> 00:46:43,640
the the easiest one is to say you<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

1271
00:46:41,599 --> 00:46:45,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">you're not only limited from acquiring</font>

these technologies<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're also</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> limited</font>

from providing material support to

federal agencies that are engaging in

1275
00:46:49,040 --> 00:46:53,900
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> so for example the the example</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

1276
00:46:50,839 --> 00:46:55,970
gave earlier about putting up<font color="#E5E5E5"> a video</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">lot like that in place and then all the</font>

1279
00:46:57,470 --> 00:47:00,589
sudden<font color="#CCCCCC"> right</font>

1280
00:46:58,910 --> 00:47:02,210
the feds can't use your telephone poles

1281
00:47:00,589 --> 00:47:04,819
right without some type of court order

1282

or<font color="#E5E5E5"> some type of action compelling the</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">there's lots of ways to combat these</font>

1285
00:47:08,180 --> 00:47:11,629
kind of caveats but the important

1286
00:47:10,309 --> 00:47:13,430
limitation of these laws is that the

1287
00:47:11,630 --> 00:47:15,470
feds can still come in often<font color="#E5E5E5"> in most</font>

cases<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and connect the same type of</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">yeah</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i also agree that the local law</font>

1301
00:47:49,920 --> 00:47:54,030
that as well and we want to have laws in

1302
00:47:52,200 --> 00:47:56,160
place that ensure that warrants are

move forward on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the surveillance</font>

1346
00:49:24,750 --> 00:49:29,550
the goal<font color="#E5E5E5"> here is to make sure that that</font>

conversation happens early and often<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

be turned<font color="#E5E5E5"> to in a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> form</font>

00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:39,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">most sense because those conversations</font>

are happening<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm sure another question</font>

briefly mentioned technologies that go

to social media<font color="#E5E5E5"> scrape them and then run</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">analysis on that and it sounded like</font>

1357
00:49:50,570 --> 00:49:55,070
they use a lot of publicly available

1358
00:49:52,280 --> 00:49:56,870
data to do that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it's very easy to</font>

1359
00:49:55,070 --> 00:49:58,910
see how those<font color="#CCCCCC"> are the technologies can</font>

1360
00:49:56,870 --> 00:50:02,420
be abused or exacerbate existing

1362
00:50:02,420 --> 00:50:05,810
available data and there's probably a

1363
00:50:04,070 --> 00:50:07,340
lot of people in the same room who could

1364
00:50:05,810 --> 00:50:11,000
do the same and then throw in a pretty

it seems like you don't have a lot of

<font color="#E5E5E5">the privacy protections available to</font>

go ahead yeah so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think it's not</font>

1381
00:50:47,090 --> 00:50:50,720

police with information about people's

political beliefs that when certain

through in what we've seen<font color="#E5E5E5"> you don't</font>

matter protesters and things like that

1396
00:51:15,830 --> 00:51:20,450
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> that it's just not appropriate for</font>

the police to hold<font color="#CCCCCC"> onto</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this information</font>

00:51:23,750 --> 00:51:27,800
so and even then you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> I personally</font>

1400
00:51:25,550 --> 00:51:29,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">am incredibly skeptical of it but you</font>

three of these in the country<font color="#CCCCCC"> and it</font>

1404
00:51:32,120 --> 00:51:36,109
<font color="#E5E5E5">would be interesting to try and update</font>

1405
00:51:33,290 --> 00:51:37,550
them so that they limited this type of

1406
00:51:36,110 --> 00:51:39,140
activity<font color="#CCCCCC"> is currently I think that</font>

1407
00:51:37,550 --> 00:51:40,670
they're drafted in a way that never

1408
00:51:39,140 --> 00:51:41,430
contemplated you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> Facebook or</font>

1409
00:51:40,670 --> 00:51:44,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">Twitter anything</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">yeah i think you know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we make rules all</font>

1411

the time as a cook as a<font color="#E5E5E5"> size society</font>

1412
00:51:46,920 --> 00:51:50,069
about what law enforcement may do<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

1413
00:51:49,079 --> 00:51:52,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">have nothing to do with the</font>

1414
00:51:50,069 --> 00:51:55,440
constitutional issues at<font color="#CCCCCC"> places</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like yes</font>

1415
00:51:52,650 --> 00:51:57,510
this is we believe a privacy issue<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

1416
00:51:55,440 --> 00:51:59,190
believe it's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> First Amendment</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> issue</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> but</font>

1417
00:51:57,510 --> 00:52:00,599
also we don't think<font color="#E5E5E5"> police should be on</font>

1418
00:51:59,190 --> 00:52:03,329
facebook at work and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we mean that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

1419
00:52:00,599 --> 00:52:05,280
more<font color="#E5E5E5"> than one way like we have the power</font>

1420
00:52:03,329 --> 00:52:07,050
as a society to decide that there are

1421
00:52:05,280 --> 00:52:09,450
certain lines going to draw about police

1422
00:52:07,050 --> 00:52:11,309
conduct in law enforcement conduct and

1423
00:52:09,450 --> 00:52:14,970
if that involves them not being able to

1424
00:52:11,309 --> 00:52:17,339
go whole cell search for hashtags that

1425
00:52:14,970 --> 00:52:19,348
are related to peaceful<font color="#CCCCCC"> protesters</font>

1426
00:52:17,339 --> 00:52:21,000
without any sort of justification that

1427
00:52:19,349 --> 00:52:23,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">they may be written down and justified</font>

1428
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:24,930
to a supervisor or to a judge will then

1429
00:52:23,010 --> 00:52:27,930
so be it<font color="#E5E5E5"> can't do that we can decide</font>

1430
00:52:24,930 --> 00:52:30,000
they<font color="#CCCCCC"> can't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do that</font>

1431
00:52:27,930 --> 00:52:31,319
yeah so I think that about wraps<font color="#E5E5E5"> up our</font>

1432
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:38,370
talk

1433
00:52:31,319 --> 00:52:42,990
thanks guys for coming out<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

1434
00:52:38,370 --> 00:52:45,089

questions in the back
