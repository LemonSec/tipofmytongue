141
00:04:44,919 --> 00:04:48,460
code would like some help if possible so

142
00:04:46,539 --> 00:04:50,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">I what I what I note here specifically</font>

143
00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:52,299
is that she says you're right so she's

144
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:53,889
not<font color="#CCCCCC"> orienting to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the fact that this is</font>

somebody else's site entirely<font color="#E5E5E5"> she's</font>

146
00:04:53,889 --> 00:04:58,539
orienting to something else and it's not

147
00:04:56,229 --> 00:05:00,460
clear what<font color="#E5E5E5"> one of the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> things i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

148
00:04:58,539 --> 00:05:01,960
going back to the previous slide the

149
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:03,878
thing that convinced me that these

150
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:07,388
people were not just not reading at all

151
00:05:03,879 --> 00:05:09,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">this woman found this page and she said</font>

152
00:05:07,389 --> 00:05:10,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">picture</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> upright like she's like ketchup</font>

153
00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:12,819
was somehow involved because the title

154
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:14,799
was catching the people and says<font color="#CCCCCC"> Johnson</font>

155
00:05:12,819 --> 00:05:16,479
blog and across the top so she read blog

156
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:17,919
and she read<font color="#E5E5E5"> catch up but there's</font>

157
00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:20,258
something in her reading skills that

158
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:22,810
<font color="#CCCCCC">were not quite working out for her</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

159
00:05:20,259 --> 00:05:25,930
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> modern</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> internet</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> context of doing</font>

160
00:05:22,810 --> 00:05:29,050
reading<font color="#E5E5E5"> so what I was doing was thinking</font>

161
00:05:25,930 --> 00:05:30,310
a lot about how these people were just

162
00:05:29,050 --> 00:05:32,770
reading in a different way and it

163
00:05:30,310 --> 00:05:34,690
happens to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> one at odds with the sort</font>

164
00:05:32,770 --> 00:05:36,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">of powerful ways of reading the internet</font>

165
00:05:34,690 --> 00:05:39,639
and the powerful ways<font color="#CCCCCC"> ringing internet</font>

166
00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:41,169
are really looking at the URL so here's

167
00:05:39,639 --> 00:05:42,699
one of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> blogs</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> regular</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> saying do you</font>

168
00:05:41,169 --> 00:05:46,330
know if you type in the URL and<font color="#E5E5E5"> search</font>

169
00:05:42,699 --> 00:05:47,889
your blog is the only<font color="#E5E5E5"> result</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

170
00:05:46,330 --> 00:05:50,409
is how people found their way to this

171
00:05:47,889 --> 00:05:52,479
blog was that they had entered the URL

172
00:05:50,409 --> 00:05:55,569
probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> into the search bar and this is</font>

173
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:57,940
actually before<font color="#CCCCCC"> most</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> browsers were</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

174
00:05:55,569 --> 00:06:00,039
disambiguating<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're not disambiguating</font>

175
00:05:57,940 --> 00:06:02,710
between<font color="#E5E5E5"> URL bar and search bar so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> really</font>

176
00:06:00,039 --> 00:06:06,490
was<font color="#E5E5E5"> just putting searches</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> into</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the URL</font>

177
00:06:02,710 --> 00:06:08,710
bar and so it leads directly there so

178
00:06:06,490 --> 00:06:10,840
what I was sort of thinking as people

179
00:06:08,710 --> 00:06:11,859
<font color="#CCCCCC">were doing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this is that they were they</font>

180
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:14,888
thought they were having a conversation

181
00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:17,409
<font color="#E5E5E5">and if you go up to somebody and you say</font>

182
00:06:14,889 --> 00:06:18,490
you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> I want to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Eminem</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

183
00:06:17,409 --> 00:06:21,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">they say hello</font>

184
00:06:18,490 --> 00:06:23,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">ketchup and blog you say what the crap</font>

185
00:06:21,550 --> 00:06:25,300
is going on here<font color="#CCCCCC"> writes like it's not</font>

186
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:26,500
there<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're assuming normal rules of</font>

187
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:27,250
human conversation this is not

188
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:28,479
unreasonable

189
00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:30,129
you know they just didn't know how to

190
00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:32,320
read the<font color="#CCCCCC"> internet as it was and so it's</font>

191
00:06:30,129 --> 00:06:33,610
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> there was something in the mismatch</font>

192
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:35,620
of how that what they thought about what

193
00:06:33,610 --> 00:06:36,370
they were doing and what people will do

194
00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:38,380
in the end is<font color="#CCCCCC"> they</font>

195
00:06:36,370 --> 00:06:40,090
just<font color="#CCCCCC"> makes sense</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with what they have and</font>

196
00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:41,409
that's what I've been focusing on a lot

197
00:06:40,090 --> 00:06:45,190
this year is just sort of how are people

198
00:06:41,410 --> 00:06:46,810
making sense of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> internet does just</font>

199
00:06:45,190 --> 00:06:48,100
like what they just said<font color="#E5E5E5"> does that make</font>

200
00:06:46,810 --> 00:06:49,479
sense<font color="#E5E5E5"> to you like the stuff of the the</font>

201
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:50,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">catch up on the blog and the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> enemy's</font>

202
00:06:49,479 --> 00:06:52,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">know it doesn't make sense to us because</font>

203
00:06:50,830 --> 00:06:54,940
we're the ones going<font color="#CCCCCC"> read the URL the</font>

204
00:06:52,990 --> 00:06:56,800
URL tells you where you are but these

205
00:06:54,940 --> 00:06:58,960
people didn't even know that URL was<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

206
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:00,610
was seeing elsewhere in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the study that</font>

207
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:04,210
when people were talking about links and

208
00:07:00,610 --> 00:07:05,500
they're talking about addresses<font color="#CCCCCC"> URLs the</font>

209
00:07:04,210 --> 00:07:06,940
the people who are showing up and

210
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:08,919
leaving the<font color="#E5E5E5"> weird comments were never</font>

211
00:07:06,940 --> 00:07:10,330
talking about they never said anything

212
00:07:08,919 --> 00:07:12,609
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> address they said things like</font>

213
00:07:10,330 --> 00:07:13,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">here's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> my home address which was not a</font>

214
00:07:12,610 --> 00:07:16,330
good thing to divulge but they were

215
00:07:13,870 --> 00:07:18,850
doing that anyway<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know here's my</font>

216
00:07:16,330 --> 00:07:22,900
street address<font color="#E5E5E5"> please come harass me and</font>

217
00:07:18,850 --> 00:07:23,919
then<font color="#CCCCCC"> uh you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know the the commenters who</font>

218
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:25,479
knew what was going on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> blogger</font>

219
00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:27,698
saying look at the URL look at the URL

220
00:07:25,479 --> 00:07:29,530
so there's this big gap in the the

221
00:07:27,699 --> 00:07:31,389
things that<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're using to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> make sense</font>

222
00:07:29,530 --> 00:07:33,039
<font color="#CCCCCC">google of course was also making its own</font>

223
00:07:31,389 --> 00:07:34,930
kind of sense and that kind of sense was

224
00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:37,449
really confusing people<font color="#E5E5E5"> because like the</font>

225
00:07:34,930 --> 00:07:39,280
woman said there was this is the only

226
00:07:37,449 --> 00:07:42,039
result left for that URL<font color="#CCCCCC"> Eminem's</font>

227
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:43,359
actually did have one<font color="#E5E5E5"> did have a result</font>

228
00:07:42,039 --> 00:07:45,340
for that as well the original result was

229
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:46,810
there but<font color="#CCCCCC"> Eminem's had taken down that</font>

230
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:48,729
particular offer and so that all that

231
00:07:46,810 --> 00:07:50,919
was left was a single<font color="#CCCCCC"> 1 pixel x</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 1 pixel</font>

232
00:07:48,729 --> 00:07:52,270
white graphic<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so the page</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> was</font>

233
00:07:50,919 --> 00:07:53,409
completely blank unless you're looking

234
00:07:52,270 --> 00:07:55,659
at the source code so that was pretty

235
00:07:53,410 --> 00:07:57,190
magical<font color="#CCCCCC"> to but to Google you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

236
00:07:55,660 --> 00:07:59,919
<font color="#CCCCCC">Google's like well obviously what you</font>

237
00:07:57,190 --> 00:08:02,410
want is URL for<font color="#CCCCCC"> Eminem catch up blog yes</font>

238
00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:03,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">you have it and people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are like I don't</font>

239
00:08:02,410 --> 00:08:06,460
speak this language what are you talking

240
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:07,900
about so you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> google is making sense</font>

241
00:08:06,460 --> 00:08:11,859
<font color="#E5E5E5">one way and other people making sense in</font>

242
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:14,739
other ways<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so you know what you have</font>

243
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:18,400
to take a look at is what people are

244
00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:20,590
using it using to reason with<font color="#E5E5E5"> Aristotle</font>

245
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:22,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">was under the impression that and made</font>

246
00:08:20,590 --> 00:08:25,000
the argument and as many thinkers have

247
00:08:22,150 --> 00:08:28,000
since I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> locked it as well that the</font>

child<font color="#E5E5E5"> was born is a tabula rasa</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a blank</font>

250
00:08:31,690 --> 00:08:35,440
you if you look at more contemporary

251
00:08:33,099 --> 00:08:36,430
research on growth and learning<font color="#E5E5E5"> that is</font>

252
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:38,860
not the case

253

nobody comes<font color="#E5E5E5"> into anything even birth</font>

254
00:08:38,860 --> 00:08:42,099
like you know you are<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're shaped by</font>

you are shaped by your immediate sense

really simple stimuli<font color="#CCCCCC"> when you're very</font>

258
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:49,579
young for example if you don't get any

nurturing you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't really develop well</font>

things in their heads<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're very</font>

00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:05,360
definitely things and so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i will talk a</font>

267
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:07,670
little bit about sort of how<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm seeing</font>

people<font color="#E5E5E5"> they will if you don't understand</font>

bit easier to understand you don't have

00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:11,240
to understand about like it's serving

303
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:19,369
it's maybe a little bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> clearer to some</font>

304
00:10:14,630 --> 00:10:21,320
people and mental model is a term that

305
00:10:19,370 --> 00:10:23,690
you'll hear a lot from cognitive

306
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:25,010
researchers<font color="#E5E5E5"> that basically means you</font>

307
00:10:23,690 --> 00:10:28,310
know the idea that people have sort of a

working system model in their brain<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">questioned some people are sort of going</font>

311
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:34,040
ok well what people are actually doing

312
00:10:32,630 --> 00:10:36,920
is just accessing that knowledge on the

313
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:38,390
fly as they go<font color="#E5E5E5"> but you know there's</font>

314
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:39,680
there's enough sort of critical mass

315
00:10:38,390 --> 00:10:42,140
around mental models that it's at least

316
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:43,339
interesting to look at these maps<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

317
00:10:42,140 --> 00:10:47,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">i'll show</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you some of those in a moment</font>

319
00:10:47,060 --> 00:10:49,939
what people will come up with when you

320
00:10:48,380 --> 00:10:52,640
ask them<font color="#E5E5E5"> and what they will sort of put</font>

together<font color="#E5E5E5"> so during the course of doing</font>

this<font color="#E5E5E5"> I did</font>

a number<font color="#E5E5E5"> of interviews a couple places</font>

things and one of my<font color="#CCCCCC"> respondents</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sister</font>

00:11:09,830 --> 00:11:15,650

331
00:11:13,220 --> 00:11:17,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">time which surprised me because I hadn't</font>

332
00:11:15,650 --> 00:11:18,829
expected him to be that technical he was

333
00:11:17,150 --> 00:11:20,060
sort of making a lot of other mistakes

334
00:11:18,830 --> 00:11:22,279
and a lot of ways when he was talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> or</font>

335
00:11:20,060 --> 00:11:25,819
<font color="#CCCCCC">so not my same mistakes he's not matched</font>

336
00:11:22,279 --> 00:11:27,020
up to<font color="#E5E5E5"> what an IT guy would know to do in</font>

337
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:29,060
order to make the system work for him

338
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:30,020
correctly right so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I mean he</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can be</font>

339
00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:31,790
coming up with something that<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe</font>

340
00:11:30,020 --> 00:11:33,439
works for him turns out to be sort of

341
00:11:31,790 --> 00:11:35,180
faulty because it doesn't match up with

342
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:39,529
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> new the actual reality that's out</font>

343
00:11:35,180 --> 00:11:43,069
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> what he said was when you open a</font>

344
00:11:39,529 --> 00:11:44,600
link it pings off a router and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then he</font>

345
00:11:43,070 --> 00:11:49,580
pointed<font color="#E5E5E5"> to a picture of a satellite that</font>

346
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:51,500
he drawn to<font color="#CCCCCC"> mean router and he says if</font>

347
00:11:49,580 --> 00:11:58,940
that link takes more than five seconds

348
00:11:51,500 --> 00:12:00,200
to load<font color="#CCCCCC"> its</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> encrypted so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> um the very</font>

349
00:11:58,940 --> 00:12:01,790
interesting thing was that he had said

350
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:04,459
<font color="#CCCCCC">paying at all right like he knew the</font>

351
00:12:01,790 --> 00:12:05,630
words<font color="#E5E5E5"> ping and router and as I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> talked to</font>

352
00:12:04,459 --> 00:12:07,219
<font color="#E5E5E5">him further it turned out that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> he'd</font>

353
00:12:05,630 --> 00:12:09,650
actually taken a couple of<font color="#E5E5E5"> community</font>

354
00:12:07,220 --> 00:12:12,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">college courses on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i.t</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sort</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of basic</font>

355
00:12:09,650 --> 00:12:14,480
entry-level course<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so what happened</font>

356
00:12:12,290 --> 00:12:16,400
is he gone from using that knowledge and

357
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:18,709
he just misappropriated like he just

358
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:20,660
misunderstood what was going on and sort

359
00:12:18,709 --> 00:12:22,099
of built this concept in his mind where

360
00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:23,569
that was going to tell you about

361
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:25,040
security<font color="#CCCCCC"> had a number of really</font>

362
00:12:23,570 --> 00:12:27,020
interesting ideas that<font color="#E5E5E5"> were</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sort of not</font>

363
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:30,260
matched up to<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know how the system</font>

364
00:12:27,020 --> 00:12:32,060
actually worked<font color="#CCCCCC"> so my guess is that</font>

365
00:12:30,260 --> 00:12:36,020
<font color="#CCCCCC">would have to be would have to take more</font>

366
00:12:32,060 --> 00:12:37,640
practice and more<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know regular use</font>

367
00:12:36,020 --> 00:12:39,560
and more correction by other people

368
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:41,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">working environment around him from to</font>

369
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:44,599
actually get the actual meaning of what

370
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:46,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">painting was and whether encryption</font>

371
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:47,810
actually had anything to do with loading

372
00:12:46,310 --> 00:12:49,040
links and things like that so he didn't

373
00:12:47,810 --> 00:12:51,079
really have<font color="#E5E5E5"> he was he was not really</font>

374
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:52,640
clear on that but that was because he

375
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:54,680
was not a tabula rasa<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know what he</font>

376
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:55,910
he was sort of taking in working with

377
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:58,489
these things in his environment and

378
00:12:55,910 --> 00:12:59,750
making them work for him in a way that

379
00:12:58,490 --> 00:13:00,800
made sense when he was explaining things

380
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:02,980
to me

381
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:04,540
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> here's some of the maps this one is</font>

382
00:13:02,980 --> 00:13:05,500
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> i said i had experts drawn</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> maps</font>

383
00:13:04,540 --> 00:13:08,860
because i wanted to get sort of<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

384
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:12,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">baseline and this one just kind of blew</font>

385
00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:13,660
my mind this<font color="#CCCCCC"> was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this guy</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I said it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

386
00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:15,339
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you give people a very</font>

387
00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:16,089
specific<font color="#CCCCCC"> scripts</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> will give you everybody</font>

388
00:13:15,339 --> 00:13:17,889
will give you more or less the same

389
00:13:16,089 --> 00:13:19,870
thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> as a reduced variables and this</font>

390
00:13:17,889 --> 00:13:23,380
particular kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> social research and I</font>

391
00:13:19,870 --> 00:13:25,420
said<font color="#E5E5E5"> explain to me how an email message</font>

392
00:13:23,380 --> 00:13:26,529
gets from you to your friend and he

393
00:13:25,420 --> 00:13:28,269
started out in the upper<font color="#E5E5E5"> left-hand</font>

394
00:13:26,529 --> 00:13:31,060
corner by saying something on the order

of well you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> blood within this</font>

397
00:13:33,190 --> 00:13:39,699
just explain to me how an email message

398
00:13:35,589 --> 00:13:41,350
could get from your friend to you if you

399
00:13:39,699 --> 00:13:42,790
were both using the same computer and

400
00:13:41,350 --> 00:13:45,670
using an obscure protocol that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think</font>

401
00:13:42,790 --> 00:13:47,079
nobody actually uses anymore so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i had</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

402
00:13:45,670 --> 00:13:48,519

00:13:48,519 --> 00:13:51,519
spectrum

405
00:13:48,970 --> 00:13:53,260
he was very very exacting and said you

406
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:55,630
know really had to be I had to make very

407
00:13:53,260 --> 00:13:57,550
clear to him like this is like this is

408
00:13:55,630 --> 00:13:58,750
the scope give me the<font color="#CCCCCC"> view general</font>

practice that most people have to deal

410
00:13:58,750 --> 00:14:03,790
with but as you can see his knowledge

411
00:14:00,519 --> 00:14:04,959
was incredibly rich like he had multiple

412
00:14:03,790 --> 00:14:06,730
ways of thinking through the system

413
00:14:04,959 --> 00:14:09,189
there's multiple protocols mentioned on

414
00:14:06,730 --> 00:14:10,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">there there's multiple you know in like</font>

sort<font color="#CCCCCC"> of working into the system and</font>

418
00:14:13,690 --> 00:14:15,819
that's because this is a guy<font color="#E5E5E5"> who's</font>

about that stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> for people who had</font>

beautiful it's just like it's so simple

it wouldn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> it be nice like if</font>

everything<font color="#E5E5E5"> looks that simple</font>

how much easier would it be to protect

00:16:10,010 --> 00:16:13,340
your servers if that was if there was no

480

482
00:16:15,710 --> 00:16:19,430
I mean what this is is sometimes you get

483
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:21,470
people just sort of going<font color="#CCCCCC"> i have no idea</font>

00:16:19,430 --> 00:16:22,699
all<font color="#E5E5E5"> i know is there's a laptop and my</font>

485
00:16:21,470 --> 00:16:23,930
friends laptop and there's something

486
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:26,000
going between them and that's all<font color="#CCCCCC"> I get</font>

487
00:16:23,930 --> 00:16:27,229
you know we actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> the one</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of things</font>

488
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,700
we did<font color="#CCCCCC"> on this on the study that we're</font>

489
00:16:27,230 --> 00:16:30,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">and just recently</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> given</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> more</font>

491
00:16:30,980 --> 00:16:33,800
them and<font color="#CCCCCC"> you sort of kept going and sort</font>

492
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:35,630
of said and what else and what else and

493
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:40,670
that helped<font color="#CCCCCC"> elicit more</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of their models</font>

494
00:16:35,630 --> 00:16:42,560
<font color="#CCCCCC">so here's some here's one of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the sort of</font>

folks in<font color="#CCCCCC"> Brownsville locally who this</font>

497
00:16:47,570 --> 00:16:50,600
particular map was interesting because

498
00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:53,810
it has two patterns that showed up

499
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:58,730
really regularly in this study of folks

500
00:16:53,810 --> 00:17:00,800
and that is<font color="#E5E5E5"> other two things so one of</font>

501
00:16:58,730 --> 00:17:04,310
them is that people tended to draw

502
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:07,550
separate systems for mobile devices and

503
00:17:04,310 --> 00:17:09,919
desktop and laptop devices because they

504
00:17:07,550 --> 00:17:10,970
were under the impression that they<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

505
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:12,590
or<font color="#E5E5E5"> at least when they were thinking that</font>

506
00:17:10,970 --> 00:17:13,910
out they were not thinking about how

507
00:17:12,589 --> 00:17:15,649
those<font color="#CCCCCC"> were connected even though no</font>

508
00:17:13,910 --> 00:17:17,400
doubt you can send an email from your

511
00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:25,260
on the radar I think the best comment<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

512
00:17:21,630 --> 00:17:28,800
had was from<font color="#E5E5E5"> this one older couple in</font>

00:17:39,570 --> 00:17:45,419
like oh can you I've never seen that

519
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:47,040
before<font color="#CCCCCC"> so I noticed there's obviously a</font>

520

lot of other conceptions that are sort

521

of not you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> underlying that like</font>

00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:51,570
there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's sort of a sense of like</font>

523
00:17:50,370 --> 00:17:54,149
the way he talked about it was just like

524
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:56,040
it's magic right like it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> it was</font>

525
00:17:54,150 --> 00:17:57,540
not something that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know there</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> was</font>

00:17:56,040 --> 00:18:00,450
some sort of system underlying it

had people draw freehand map like this

00:18:06,270 --> 00:18:09,540
we just said fill up a blank page and

532
00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:11,159
then we gave them a little bit more

533
00:18:09,540 --> 00:18:15,240
scaffolding we actually gave them<font color="#CCCCCC"> icon</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">some stickers of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> particular elements</font>

that were involved in sending email and

536
00:18:18,150 --> 00:18:22,350
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I even when they we gave him the</font>

537
00:18:20,850 --> 00:18:23,760
sticker that said mailbox<font color="#CCCCCC"> they used in</font>

538
00:18:22,350 --> 00:18:25,860
some unexpected ways and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'll talk about</font>

539
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:27,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">that more in just a moment</font>

540
00:18:25,860 --> 00:18:29,370
the other really interesting pattern

541
00:18:27,510 --> 00:18:31,710
that kept coming up that was<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> kind</font>

542
00:18:29,370 --> 00:18:33,449
<font color="#CCCCCC">of like weirded out by was like when</font>

543
00:18:31,710 --> 00:18:34,350
they<font color="#CCCCCC"> talked about Wi-Fi or routers or</font>

544
00:18:33,450 --> 00:18:35,700
things like that

545
00:18:34,350 --> 00:18:37,350
this is a free hand so they came up with

546
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:39,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">her out of themselves there is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of</font>

547
00:18:37,350 --> 00:18:41,429
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> faucet model where it's like the</font>

548
00:18:39,210 --> 00:18:44,520
internet comes in through the Wi-Fi

549
00:18:41,430 --> 00:18:46,020
device and there's no indication that

550
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:47,970
communication goes back out through that

551
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:49,200
same device where it goes<font color="#E5E5E5"> is not</font>

552
00:18:47,970 --> 00:18:50,400
entirely<font color="#E5E5E5"> clear they clearly had a sense</font>

553
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:51,870
that it goes through but frequently

554
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:53,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">would go around the router go someplace</font>

555
00:18:51,870 --> 00:18:54,959
<font color="#CCCCCC">else so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you notice that here the routers</font>

556
00:18:53,220 --> 00:18:57,240
are just like the the stuff in the

557
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:58,380
middle is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the stuff you know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

558
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:59,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">stuff going between the two computers</font>

559
00:18:58,380 --> 00:19:01,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the router just sort of there there</font>

560
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:02,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">there bring</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the internet into your house</font>

561
00:19:01,650 --> 00:19:05,340
but they're not sending anything back

562
00:19:02,730 --> 00:19:08,760
out again<font color="#E5E5E5"> right so like I was saying</font>

563
00:19:05,340 --> 00:19:10,379
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> with icon with them with mailboxes</font>

564
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:11,760
specifically like<font color="#CCCCCC"> I said people are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> our</font>

565
00:19:10,380 --> 00:19:13,770
reasoning off of surface features so

566
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:14,850
when they thought about mailbox<font color="#CCCCCC"> what</font>

567
00:19:13,770 --> 00:19:18,240
they thought was this is the thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

568
00:19:14,850 --> 00:19:20,520
click on<font color="#E5E5E5"> in order to get to my mail and</font>

569
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:22,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">I think the whole concept of mailboxes</font>

570
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:25,500
generally like you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> I have multiple</font>

571
00:19:22,290 --> 00:19:27,240
mailboxes<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know junk is a mailbox</font>

572
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:28,740
the reason<font color="#CCCCCC"> i have mail boxes</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there's one</font>

573
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:29,960
on the server and<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's remote and I have</font>

574
00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:32,750
to access it

575
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:34,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">you know and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that they're not thinking</font>

576
00:19:32,750 --> 00:19:36,590
about like you know that there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

577
00:19:34,580 --> 00:19:38,629
<font color="#CCCCCC">there you can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sync up because it's both</font>

578
00:19:36,590 --> 00:19:40,730
on the server and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's on my device at</font>

579
00:19:38,630 --> 00:19:43,220
the same time<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm can anybody in the</font>

580
00:19:40,730 --> 00:19:44,630
audience hazard a guess as to why any of

581
00:19:43,220 --> 00:19:46,279
us<font color="#CCCCCC"> who are maybe</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not even all that</font>

582
00:19:44,630 --> 00:19:52,370
formally trained understand that there's

583
00:19:46,279 --> 00:19:57,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">mailboxes on servers</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and shout out right</font>

584
00:19:52,370 --> 00:19:59,178
<font color="#E5E5E5">because because service</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm not hearing</font>

585
00:19:57,020 --> 00:20:01,789
<font color="#CCCCCC">to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> clearly</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> my guess is that generally</font>

586
00:19:59,179 --> 00:20:03,409
it's because we were around for an era

587
00:20:01,789 --> 00:20:04,760
when you didn't have constantly<font color="#CCCCCC"> synced</font>

588
00:20:03,409 --> 00:20:06,409
<font color="#CCCCCC">mail right like you were</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> aware that</font>

589
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:09,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">sometimes there would be you would have</font>

590
00:20:06,409 --> 00:20:11,630
to go back and access your mail and<font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font>

591
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:14,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">synced up and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i forget</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> which protocols</font>

592
00:20:11,630 --> 00:20:16,669
which pop and<font color="#CCCCCC"> imap</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> pop3 right so that's</font>

593
00:20:14,390 --> 00:20:18,289
<font color="#E5E5E5">what we're using now</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we're that's the i</font>

594
00:20:16,669 --> 00:20:19,909
<font color="#CCCCCC">might as well be doesn't yet so the</font>

595
00:20:18,289 --> 00:20:21,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">thing is we remember pop3 and nobody</font>

596
00:20:19,909 --> 00:20:22,970
else remembers<font color="#E5E5E5"> pop3 so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that's we don't</font>

597
00:20:21,860 --> 00:20:24,139
they don't have that to reason with all

598
00:20:22,970 --> 00:20:26,720
they have to reason with<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there's an</font>

599
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:28,700
icon<font color="#E5E5E5"> is on my machine and so of course</font>

600
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:30,559
servers were gone<font color="#E5E5E5"> there were no servers</font>

601
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:31,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">and even when we gave them stickers of</font>

602
00:20:30,559 --> 00:20:34,039
servers sometimes they wouldn't use them

603
00:20:31,970 --> 00:20:35,299
sometimes they would go from<font color="#CCCCCC"> their</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hand</font>

604
00:20:34,039 --> 00:20:36,559
<font color="#E5E5E5">drawn maps and where they had said</font>

605
00:20:35,299 --> 00:20:39,350
satellite or something like that and

606
00:20:36,559 --> 00:20:40,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">then they</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> say oh well I i</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> meant server</font>

607
00:20:39,350 --> 00:20:41,209
right so<font color="#E5E5E5"> they</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> were seen as</font>

608
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:45,350
interchangeable and was frequently

609
00:20:41,210 --> 00:20:46,640
satellites especially<font color="#CCCCCC"> so i think a lot</font>

610
00:20:45,350 --> 00:20:48,049
of folks<font color="#CCCCCC"> i was talking to a New Yorker</font>

611
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:49,010
sort of<font color="#CCCCCC"> mobile first populations they</font>

612
00:20:48,049 --> 00:20:51,559
<font color="#E5E5E5">haven't spent as much time on the</font>

613
00:20:49,010 --> 00:20:53,210
desktop<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so that was how they thought</font>

614
00:20:51,559 --> 00:20:55,399
that their phone connectivity was

615
00:20:53,210 --> 00:20:56,779
getting to them so that<font color="#E5E5E5"> was sort of that</font>

616
00:20:55,399 --> 00:20:58,370
infrastructure<font color="#CCCCCC"> was all sort of hidden</font>

617
00:20:56,779 --> 00:20:59,539
<font color="#E5E5E5">basically like it was it was behind the</font>

618
00:20:58,370 --> 00:21:00,770
scenes and they didn't have that to

619
00:20:59,539 --> 00:21:02,600
reason that they couldn't think about it

620
00:21:00,770 --> 00:21:03,860
right<font color="#E5E5E5"> so I've been thinking actually one</font>

621
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:05,510
of the things that could conceivably be

622
00:21:03,860 --> 00:21:07,520
helpful to users

623
00:21:05,510 --> 00:21:09,200
I know the<font color="#E5E5E5"> trend and usability is to</font>

624
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:10,668
make interfaces as simple as<font color="#E5E5E5"> humanly</font>

625
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:11,960
possible<font color="#E5E5E5"> and not burden users with</font>

626
00:21:10,669 --> 00:21:13,610
additional information but some sort of

627
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:15,559
thing like this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> syncing with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

628
00:21:13,610 --> 00:21:17,149
<font color="#E5E5E5">server the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> server thing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you can see it</font>

629
00:21:15,559 --> 00:21:18,889
<font color="#E5E5E5">like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like that you know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> microsoft</font>

630
00:21:17,149 --> 00:21:21,469
<font color="#CCCCCC">windows like your</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> things going into the</font>

trash basket<font color="#E5E5E5"> like some some little</font>

632
00:21:21,470 --> 00:21:24,830
animation might just go a long way to

633
00:21:23,390 --> 00:21:26,419
helping people understand that there is

634
00:21:24,830 --> 00:21:28,580
a something out there that's not your

635
00:21:26,419 --> 00:21:30,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">machinery</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> or stuff is the other thing</font>

636
00:21:28,580 --> 00:21:33,139
<font color="#CCCCCC">that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just completely blew my mind is</font>

637
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:34,909
<font color="#CCCCCC">there is a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> couple of casual offhand</font>

638
00:21:33,140 --> 00:21:39,590
comments made by various people to the

639
00:21:34,909 --> 00:21:43,159
effect of wires aren't cool anymore

640
00:21:39,590 --> 00:21:44,658
so that was like people sort of going

641
00:21:43,159 --> 00:21:45,860
well of course all this goes<font color="#E5E5E5"> through the</font>

642
00:21:44,659 --> 00:21:48,529
air goes through the air goes through

643
00:21:45,860 --> 00:21:51,500
the air<font color="#E5E5E5"> we just like it's like the new</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">trend the new hotness is his</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Wi-Fi and</font>

645
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:54,409
so we don't use wires they don't believe

646
00:21:52,970 --> 00:21:55,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">anything</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going over</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> wire so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you know</font>

647
00:21:54,409 --> 00:21:58,159
forget teaching them about wiretapping

648
00:21:55,970 --> 00:22:00,169
<font color="#CCCCCC">you know forget teaching them about that</font>

649
00:21:58,159 --> 00:22:02,480
kind of connectivity<font color="#CCCCCC"> and I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think the</font>

650
00:22:00,169 --> 00:22:04,340
best comment<font color="#CCCCCC"> i had there was one couple</font>

651
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:07,370
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> women i was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> talking to one of them</font>

652
00:22:04,340 --> 00:22:11,090
said<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah it goes through the fiber</font>

653
00:22:07,370 --> 00:22:12,949
which i think is in the air so that was

654
00:22:11,090 --> 00:22:14,629
like that was<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you know she's she's</font>

655
00:22:12,950 --> 00:22:15,950
heard the word<font color="#E5E5E5"> fiber and she's heard</font>

656
00:22:14,630 --> 00:22:17,539
that things are in the air and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's</font>

657
00:22:15,950 --> 00:22:18,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's what she puts together like she</font>

658
00:22:17,539 --> 00:22:21,289
has to make sense of it so that is how

659
00:22:18,950 --> 00:22:22,399
she puts<font color="#E5E5E5"> those things together</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font>

started talking about how<font color="#CCCCCC"> male wouldn't</font>

666
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:37,908
go<font color="#CCCCCC"> through sometimes</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if you made an</font>

667
00:22:35,630 --> 00:22:41,000
attachment that was too big and the mail

668
00:22:37,909 --> 00:22:42,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">is being sent through</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is packets and you</font>

669
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:44,210
know she had some sense of like<font color="#E5E5E5"> file</font>

670
00:22:42,710 --> 00:22:45,919
size mattered and<font color="#E5E5E5"> attachments</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> battered</font>

671
00:22:44,210 --> 00:22:46,850
and packets<font color="#E5E5E5"> were way things went</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and she</font>

672
00:22:45,919 --> 00:22:47,720
wasn't completely clear on the details

673
00:22:46,850 --> 00:22:50,330
but this is probably the most

674
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:51,260
sophisticated sense of how these things

675
00:22:50,330 --> 00:22:52,340
are gone

676
00:22:51,260 --> 00:22:54,140
<font color="#CCCCCC">what I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> learned about this woman</font>

677
00:22:52,340 --> 00:22:56,629
eventually is that she had done an

678
00:22:54,140 --> 00:22:59,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">associate's degree in computer science</font>

679
00:22:56,630 --> 00:23:01,309
in 2002<font color="#CCCCCC"> she's now working on medical</font>

680
00:22:59,750 --> 00:23:02,480
systems in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the hospital and so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> she</font>

681
00:23:01,309 --> 00:23:04,010
<font color="#CCCCCC">understands she also</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> understand about</font>

682
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:05,750
HIPAA protection and privacy and things

683
00:23:04,010 --> 00:23:07,158
like that<font color="#CCCCCC"> and also been reading the news</font>

686
00:23:09,559 --> 00:23:13,820
she had what<font color="#E5E5E5"> is sometimes been called</font>

687
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:15,979
<font color="#E5E5E5">fragile knowledge so when she was</font>

688
00:23:13,820 --> 00:23:18,559
talking about those packets<font color="#CCCCCC"> she started</font>

689
00:23:15,980 --> 00:23:22,070
talking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have to use a zip</font>

is never here to the zip drive<font color="#E5E5E5"> couple</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">Millennials in the room maybe drivers</font>

693
00:23:26,270 --> 00:23:29,929
<font color="#CCCCCC">have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> been out of date since like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 2002</font>

694
00:23:28,309 --> 00:23:31,730
when she was in school right

695
00:23:29,929 --> 00:23:33,950
but of course<font color="#E5E5E5"> she's also got this to</font>

696
00:23:31,730 --> 00:23:35,480
reason off of right this is what we give

697
00:23:33,950 --> 00:23:37,399
people to look at<font color="#E5E5E5"> to think about a</font>

00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:39,409
compressed file<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's all zipped up so to</font>

699
00:23:37,399 --> 00:23:41,629
her she was conflating the two of them

700
00:23:39,409 --> 00:23:43,070
and still trying to make sense<font color="#CCCCCC"> so the</font>

701
00:23:41,630 --> 00:23:44,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">the really tragic thing is here's a</font>

702
00:23:43,070 --> 00:23:45,408
woman who actually did have the concepts

703
00:23:44,630 --> 00:23:47,090
pretty well she had a good

704
00:23:45,409 --> 00:23:47,539
infrastructure of mental model to build

705
00:23:47,090 --> 00:23:49,459
on

706
00:23:47,539 --> 00:23:51,049
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> just like because she hadn't been</font>

707
00:23:49,460 --> 00:23:53,059
kept up you know either through her job

708
00:23:51,049 --> 00:23:54,408
her like ongoing professional training

709
00:23:53,059 --> 00:23:56,450
he was using words that like<font color="#CCCCCC"> if she was</font>

710
00:23:54,409 --> 00:23:58,220
trying to test in at a job interview or

711
00:23:56,450 --> 00:24:00,590
something like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> she might be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> will</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

712
00:23:58,220 --> 00:24:01,879
<font color="#E5E5E5">like a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> she says stupid you know which</font>

713
00:24:00,590 --> 00:24:03,080
would be terrible because she really she

714
00:24:01,879 --> 00:24:06,740
got it better than a lot of other people

715
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:08,899
and so the trick is really<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think sort</font>

716
00:24:06,740 --> 00:24:10,279
of helping people build<font color="#CCCCCC"> ongoing</font>

717
00:24:08,899 --> 00:24:12,168
knowledge that helps them be flexible

718
00:24:10,279 --> 00:24:13,700
like help them<font color="#CCCCCC"> so like I said she's got</font>

719
00:24:12,169 --> 00:24:14,870
the system she had a sense of how the

720
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:17,149
parts related to each other<font color="#CCCCCC"> they have a</font>

721
00:24:14,870 --> 00:24:18,379
server worked<font color="#E5E5E5"> into things making sure</font>

722
00:24:17,149 --> 00:24:21,289
that people have some really basic

723
00:24:18,379 --> 00:24:23,120
things like that can help them rather

724
00:24:21,289 --> 00:24:24,529
than sort of going like one of the worst

725
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:25,820
ways you can possibly teach with

726
00:24:24,529 --> 00:24:28,159
computers and I'm sure all of you know

727
00:24:25,820 --> 00:24:29,418
this is going to click this button and

728
00:24:28,159 --> 00:24:30,590
then go and click this button and then

729
00:24:29,419 --> 00:24:32,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">go and click this button</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the next</font>

730
00:24:30,590 --> 00:24:34,189
time windows goes ahead and changes word

731
00:24:32,330 --> 00:24:36,019
again like they're basically screwed

732
00:24:34,190 --> 00:24:37,399
they have no way to know what to do

733
00:24:36,019 --> 00:24:38,929
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> they don't know multiple ways of</font>

734
00:24:37,399 --> 00:24:42,320
doing the same thing and they don't know

735
00:24:38,929 --> 00:24:44,539
why they're doing what they're doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

736
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:46,428
couple more thoughts on people's mental

737
00:24:44,539 --> 00:24:48,259
models this is an absolutely great study

738
00:24:46,429 --> 00:24:50,059
done by some security folks at Google

739
00:24:48,259 --> 00:24:52,039
who also<font color="#CCCCCC"> talked to experts</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

740
00:24:50,059 --> 00:24:53,418
<font color="#CCCCCC">non-experts about their recommendations</font>

741
00:24:52,039 --> 00:24:55,309
for security practices

742
00:24:53,419 --> 00:24:56,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">oh I think one of the most interesting</font>

743
00:24:55,309 --> 00:24:58,940
things sort of came out<font color="#E5E5E5"> of what they</font>

744
00:24:56,600 --> 00:25:00,889
found was so obviously<font color="#E5E5E5"> everyday people</font>

745
00:24:58,940 --> 00:25:02,090
tend to think using<font color="#CCCCCC"> antivirus software</font>

746
00:25:00,889 --> 00:25:03,529
is the best way to make yourself safe

747
00:25:02,090 --> 00:25:07,789
which of course we all snicker at right

748
00:25:03,529 --> 00:25:09,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">and that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> what they sort</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of talked about</font>

749
00:25:07,789 --> 00:25:12,259
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> google research talked about is</font>

750
00:25:09,230 --> 00:25:14,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">experts know like sandy</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Clark said</font>

751
00:25:12,259 --> 00:25:18,590
yesterday<font color="#E5E5E5"> in her talk</font>

752
00:25:14,330 --> 00:25:21,529
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> uh security is is or software is</font>

753
00:25:18,590 --> 00:25:23,149
broken its broken<font color="#CCCCCC"> its flawed</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> everyday</font>

754
00:25:21,529 --> 00:25:24,379
people don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> realize that the problem is</font>

755
00:25:23,149 --> 00:25:25,879
in the software that they're running

756
00:25:24,379 --> 00:25:27,830
they think they can have an<font color="#E5E5E5"> add-on thing</font>

757
00:25:25,879 --> 00:25:29,209
that blocks from outside threats that

758
00:25:27,830 --> 00:25:31,158
are all can<font color="#E5E5E5"> entirely external to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

759
00:25:29,210 --> 00:25:32,899
machines<font color="#CCCCCC"> so that's like a fundamental</font>

760
00:25:31,159 --> 00:25:36,259
concept underneath there that is really

761
00:25:32,899 --> 00:25:37,279
hurting<font color="#CCCCCC"> everyday</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people when they're</font>

762
00:25:36,259 --> 00:25:39,769
thinking if<font color="#CCCCCC"> we can talk to them a little</font>

763
00:25:37,279 --> 00:25:41,779
bit more about like you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's it's</font>

764
00:25:39,769 --> 00:25:42,889
<font color="#E5E5E5">your computer is broken and then then of</font>

765
00:25:41,779 --> 00:25:44,389
<font color="#E5E5E5">course you're gonna have to explain like</font>

766
00:25:42,889 --> 00:25:46,008
well why isn't there a warranty year

767
00:25:44,389 --> 00:25:50,029
like why<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't have some recourse</font>

768
00:25:46,009 --> 00:25:51,169
against this right so passwords<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> some</font>

769
00:25:50,029 --> 00:25:53,990
interesting stuff<font color="#CCCCCC"> i was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> finding</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">passwords were even involved in securing</font>

773
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:59,899
their mailboxes just because they did it

once on<font color="#E5E5E5"> their device and they've never</font>

00:25:59,899 --> 00:26:04,229
had to go back to it again

776
00:26:01,740 --> 00:26:07,559
<font color="#E5E5E5">so those are all sort of possible</font>

803
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:10,530
using the command line you have to

804
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:11,370
recall what it is you have to put in

805
00:27:10,530 --> 00:27:12,870
here<font color="#E5E5E5"> right</font>

806
00:27:11,370 --> 00:27:14,250
and for most of us use the command line

807
00:27:12,870 --> 00:27:15,899
on a regular basis not a big deal

808
00:27:14,250 --> 00:27:18,000
because we remember you know various

809
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:19,290
words and tasks but for people who use

810
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:21,270
it frequently for people<font color="#CCCCCC"> who have never</font>

811
00:27:19,290 --> 00:27:22,678
used<font color="#CCCCCC"> before the amount of cognitive work</font>

812
00:27:21,270 --> 00:27:23,910
they have to do the amount of cognitive

813
00:27:22,679 --> 00:27:26,010
load<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're putting on them to make them</font>

814
00:27:23,910 --> 00:27:28,559
remember this stuff is prohibitive and

815
00:27:26,010 --> 00:27:29,790
makes them feel like crap so that's that

816
00:27:28,559 --> 00:27:31,649
was the reason<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was basically making</font>

817
00:27:29,790 --> 00:27:34,620
this argument here<font color="#E5E5E5"> and this is the kind</font>

818
00:27:31,650 --> 00:27:36,030
of thing is also sort of what users use

819
00:27:34,620 --> 00:27:37,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">post-its for their passwords like if</font>

825
00:27:44,190 --> 00:27:48,120
and we'll do something else and that's

826
00:27:45,090 --> 00:27:50,610
what those post-its are so the more we

827
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:52,229
can do to help people<font color="#E5E5E5"> recognize</font>

something like you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> captures sort of</font>

going like this is a horse like<font color="#CCCCCC"> it poked</font>

don't don't cause people to suddenly

that's happening because they don't have

saying it looks like the chat log is

there one of them said<font color="#E5E5E5"> this looks like</font>

00:32:10,650 --> 00:32:14,309
something the feds would use to keep

it needed to look more like apps that

and years<font color="#CCCCCC"> of some amazing articles and I</font>

973
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:39,780
think like advice about how bad police

974
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:40,320
corruption is there so these are people

975
00:32:39,780 --> 00:32:42,240
who had

00:32:48,149 --> 00:32:51,268
generally this is an amazing study that

00:32:50,009 --> 00:32:53,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">Apple did back in the eighties I think</font>

00:32:51,269 --> 00:32:55,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">they updated</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it recently where they</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

ensuring that<font color="#E5E5E5"> i was a permanent customer</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">oh</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and destroying my image</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> go</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so yeah</font>

986
00:33:03,149 --> 00:33:06,600
that was that was how they got us<font color="#CCCCCC"> but</font>

987
00:33:05,039 --> 00:33:08,850
then they also did a lot of studies of

988
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:10,379
why some teachers would continue using

989
00:33:08,850 --> 00:33:11,879
technology and how they would use it and

990
00:33:10,380 --> 00:33:13,259
how they wouldn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> and one</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of the things</font>

991
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:14,940
they found that the teachers who did not

992
00:33:13,259 --> 00:33:16,259
continue to use the computers they were

993
00:33:14,940 --> 00:33:18,120
given or would use them<font color="#CCCCCC"> as sort</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of like</font>

00:33:16,259 --> 00:33:20,100
drilling<font color="#CCCCCC"> kilbourne kinds of ways</font>

995
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:22,768
those are the teachers who believed that

996
00:33:20,100 --> 00:33:24,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">who placed high emphasis on order in</font>

997
00:33:22,769 --> 00:33:25,379
<font color="#E5E5E5">their classroom like if they were used</font>

998
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:28,169
to making everybody sit down and shut up

999
00:33:25,379 --> 00:33:29,189
and not having students excitedly share

1000
00:33:28,169 --> 00:33:31,110
information with each other or

1001
00:33:29,190 --> 00:33:32,669
techniques and if they were not used to

1002
00:33:31,110 --> 00:33:34,289
having students<font color="#E5E5E5"> like actually teach the</font>

1003
00:33:32,669 --> 00:33:36,059
entire class and stepping aside<font color="#CCCCCC"> allowing</font>

1004
00:33:34,289 --> 00:33:37,139
students<font color="#E5E5E5"> have expertise</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> then they were</font>

1005
00:33:36,059 --> 00:33:40,019
going to continue on to that technology

1006
00:33:37,139 --> 00:33:41,309
which of course then you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> wastes</font>

1007
00:33:40,019 --> 00:33:42,419
entire<font color="#E5E5E5"> generations of students who are</font>

in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> classrooms</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with teachers who are</font>

1009
00:33:42,419 --> 00:33:46,080
really frustrating that way but so that

1010
00:33:44,909 --> 00:33:47,940
that's something<font color="#CCCCCC"> where this this</font>

1011
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:49,470
particular study<font color="#CCCCCC"> emphasize that when you</font>

1012
00:33:47,940 --> 00:33:51,000
are working with teachers to try to get

1013
00:33:49,470 --> 00:33:53,129
them to adopt technology you have to

1014
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:54,450
work on their existing culture of

1015
00:33:53,129 --> 00:33:56,279
teaching their existing beliefs about

1016
00:33:54,450 --> 00:33:57,149
teaching and you may need to say okay

1017
00:33:56,279 --> 00:33:58,529
now get ready

1018
00:33:57,149 --> 00:34:00,479
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is going to cause your students to</font>

1019
00:33:58,529 --> 00:34:02,279
<font color="#E5E5E5">talk to each other and you may just have</font>

1020
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:03,870
to let go on that<font color="#E5E5E5"> like and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> here are some</font>

1021
00:34:02,279 --> 00:34:04,559
<font color="#E5E5E5">ways to help you manage that a little</font>

1022
00:34:03,870 --> 00:34:06,418
bit better

1023
00:34:04,559 --> 00:34:07,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">otherwise you know if you don't do that</font>

1024
00:34:06,419 --> 00:34:08,940
sort of cultural work and it's actually

1025
00:34:07,620 --> 00:34:10,348
<font color="#E5E5E5">the sort of major feeling of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the one</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">laptop per child project</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they just</font>

1027
00:34:10,349 --> 00:34:13,889
<font color="#CCCCCC">sort of didn't have anybody in there</font>

1028
00:34:11,609 --> 00:34:14,879
doing the cultural work to sort of match

1029
00:34:13,889 --> 00:34:17,490
things up with what people were doing

1030
00:34:14,879 --> 00:34:20,549
the local community that can really

1031
00:34:17,489 --> 00:34:21,359
ultimately<font color="#CCCCCC"> slow you down</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in terms of</font>

1032
00:34:20,550 --> 00:34:23,310
adoption

1033
00:34:21,359 --> 00:34:24,989
let's see<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think i can actually skip</font>

1034
00:34:23,310 --> 00:34:29,310
over the next slide

1035
00:34:24,989 --> 00:34:30,479
talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> is noticing time um so there are</font>

1036
00:34:29,310 --> 00:34:33,569
some other sort of things that are sort

1037
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:35,879
of more at the cultural personal level

1038
00:34:33,569 --> 00:34:42,569
<font color="#CCCCCC">there's a thing called stereotype threat</font>

1039
00:34:35,879 --> 00:34:45,239
and the the sort of finding here is that

1040
00:34:42,569 --> 00:34:47,379
if you say to people before they start

1041
00:34:45,239 --> 00:34:49,928
<font color="#E5E5E5">at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ask</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> something about them that is</font>

1042
00:34:47,379 --> 00:34:51,609
<font color="#E5E5E5">sort of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> negative perception</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of people</font>

1043
00:34:49,929 --> 00:34:53,559
like them so if you say like women

1044
00:34:51,609 --> 00:34:54,759
aren't good at math or if you say

1045
00:34:53,559 --> 00:34:56,109
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of even if it's just sort</font>

00:34:54,759 --> 00:34:58,240
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> available thing about that like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> or</font>

1047
00:34:56,109 --> 00:35:01,569
gay people are just not cool<font color="#CCCCCC"> enough to</font>

go<font color="#E5E5E5"> away you know if you do that no</font>

1049
00:35:01,569 --> 00:35:05,259

1050
00:35:02,980 --> 00:35:08,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">it's related</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> task the performance of</font>

1059
00:35:21,430 --> 00:35:25,629
will perform less well so frequently if

1060
00:35:23,470 --> 00:35:26,890
you go in and you sort of say anything

1061
00:35:25,630 --> 00:35:29,529
about even calling attention to

1062

and right after that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and uh so yeah so</font>

1075
00:35:55,869 --> 00:35:59,440
stereotype threat is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the is what happens</font>

1076
00:35:58,089 --> 00:36:01,390
when you know you present something with

<font color="#E5E5E5">a stereotype that sort of lessons their</font>

the initial cognitive finding was that

when you give<font color="#E5E5E5"> animals shocks</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> always</font>

1091

give<font color="#CCCCCC"> animals shocks and don't give them</font>

00:36:33,250 --> 00:36:35,799
ultimately decide there's nothing they

physically put them up and take them

pick them up and take them away from the

scary stories about tech in the media

and that's part of what's forming their

mental model and that is contributing to

this forty percent of people who want to

stop so terrifying stuff what can you do

1198

00:39:52,519 --> 00:39:55,609
give off any signs if you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

1206
00:39:54,439 --> 00:39:57,799

1207
00:39:55,609 --> 00:39:59,119
<font color="#CCCCCC">i know it's hard but like because</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">may</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> interpret it was like oh</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> god they</font>

1209
00:39:59,119 --> 00:40:01,579

1210
00:40:00,409 --> 00:40:04,159
learn anything right so that's that's

1211
00:40:01,579 --> 00:40:05,509
<font color="#E5E5E5">when they may just turn off before you</font>

questions first

00:40:10,429 --> 00:40:13,099
<font color="#E5E5E5">they don't have to draw out the mental</font>

00:40:14,539 --> 00:40:19,009
that helps<font color="#CCCCCC"> to that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really cool to see</font>

1220
00:40:15,949 --> 00:40:20,719
<font color="#CCCCCC">um i just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have them explain it to you</font>

1221
00:40:19,009 --> 00:40:22,129
one way or another and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you see</font>

1222
00:40:20,719 --> 00:40:23,539
any misconceptions<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the moment to be</font>

1223
00:40:22,129 --> 00:40:24,709
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay well the thing i need to think</font>

1224
00:40:23,539 --> 00:40:25,819
about what<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> telling</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> them things</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

1225
00:40:24,709 --> 00:40:26,989
don't have to interrupt them but like

1226
00:40:25,819 --> 00:40:29,449
when you start talking to them you can

1227
00:40:26,989 --> 00:40:31,279
say<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so you thought that you know</font>

1228
00:40:29,449 --> 00:40:33,499
your mailbox was just<font color="#E5E5E5"> enormous trip</font>

1229
00:40:31,279 --> 00:40:35,089
computer<font color="#E5E5E5"> but did you know the reason why</font>

1230
00:40:33,499 --> 00:40:37,788
it's so magical and you can access your

1231
00:40:35,089 --> 00:40:38,899
phone your computer at the same time is

1232
00:40:37,789 --> 00:40:40,729
because there's a mailbox<font color="#CCCCCC"> and both</font>

1233
00:40:38,899 --> 00:40:42,199
<font color="#E5E5E5">machines right so don't over-explain</font>

1234
00:40:40,729 --> 00:40:43,999
<font color="#E5E5E5">either like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just just give them</font>

1235
00:40:42,199 --> 00:40:45,589
sufficient stuff like don't be like that

1236
00:40:43,999 --> 00:40:46,879
guy who was like and then there's this

1237
00:40:45,589 --> 00:40:48,109
protocol where you can send things to

1238
00:40:46,879 --> 00:40:49,489
yourself on your own computer like

1239
00:40:48,109 --> 00:40:51,589
<font color="#CCCCCC">don'tdon't Odette please</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't do that</font>

1240
00:40:49,489 --> 00:40:54,679
like just keep it<font color="#E5E5E5"> as keep it relevant</font>

1241
00:40:51,589 --> 00:40:56,569
<font color="#E5E5E5">and necessary</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> don't also don't assume</font>

1242
00:40:54,679 --> 00:40:57,829
they're saying they have the assumptions

1243
00:40:56,569 --> 00:40:59,029
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've given you here they may have a</font>

1250
00:41:08,269 --> 00:41:12,138
was terrified of copy paste because<font color="#E5E5E5"> she</font>

1251
00:41:10,789 --> 00:41:13,429
couldn't see the clipboard she has no

1252
00:41:12,139 --> 00:41:15,289
idea what was on it and I think she

1253
00:41:13,429 --> 00:41:16,729
didn't have the<font color="#E5E5E5"> tool of like open a text</font>

1255
00:41:16,729 --> 00:41:20,299
<font color="#E5E5E5">and you know it's not gone for good like</font>

1256
00:41:18,349 --> 00:41:20,839
I learned that so long ago<font color="#CCCCCC"> I don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> even</font>

1257
00:41:20,299 --> 00:41:22,339
remember that

00:41:20,839 --> 00:41:24,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">anymore</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i remember i imagine most</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of you</font>

1259
00:41:22,339 --> 00:41:26,779
do<font color="#E5E5E5"> too but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they're there</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> may be random</font>

1260
00:41:24,950 --> 00:41:28,999
things that are<font color="#E5E5E5"> are really causing</font>

1261
00:41:26,779 --> 00:41:30,650
people's anxiety about this stuff and

1262
00:41:28,999 --> 00:41:33,049
maybe sort of holding them back

1263
00:41:30,650 --> 00:41:34,309
<font color="#CCCCCC">I'm gonna</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> come to stereotype threat</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm</font>

1264
00:41:33,049 --> 00:41:36,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">encouraged people to think of their</font>

1265
00:41:34,309 --> 00:41:38,089
<font color="#CCCCCC">strengths</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> beforehand like if you know</font>

1266
00:41:36,410 --> 00:41:40,190
you know that they're good at math or

1267
00:41:38,089 --> 00:41:41,479
you know that they're really good at UM

1268
00:41:40,190 --> 00:41:43,219
you know if<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're really careful with</font>

1269
00:41:41,479 --> 00:41:45,979
<font color="#CCCCCC">their privacy in other things like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

00:41:43,219 --> 00:41:48,469
thinking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about their diary or you know</font>

hey you know you did really well<font color="#CCCCCC"> on that</font>

1273
00:41:49,819 --> 00:41:53,058
let me show you a couple of other tricks

1274
00:41:50,900 --> 00:41:54,619
you know that you can do because if you

1275
00:41:53,059 --> 00:41:56,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">can emphasize</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> strength than</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

1276
00:41:54,619 --> 00:41:58,249
will definitely help lessen stereotype

1277
00:41:56,930 --> 00:42:00,410
threat<font color="#CCCCCC"> and the negative effects that</font>

1278
00:41:58,249 --> 00:42:02,689
<font color="#CCCCCC">cause people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to sort of bow out</font>

1279
00:42:00,410 --> 00:42:04,009
<font color="#CCCCCC">emphasize multiple sides of their</font>

1280
00:42:02,690 --> 00:42:05,779
identity<font color="#CCCCCC"> I had somebody come to me</font>

1281
00:42:04,009 --> 00:42:07,099
recently<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm he's not here today but you</font>

1282
00:42:05,779 --> 00:42:08,749
mentioned that he'd see me<font color="#CCCCCC"> at a previous</font>

00:42:07,099 --> 00:42:10,789
<font color="#E5E5E5">conference and wanted to introduce to me</font>

1284
00:42:08,749 --> 00:42:12,229
his young daughter because she has other

1288
00:42:16,069 --> 00:42:19,849
never<font color="#E5E5E5"> been pretty girly but you know if</font>

1289
00:42:18,380 --> 00:42:21,559
you can emphasize to people you know

00:42:19,849 --> 00:42:23,509
other<font color="#E5E5E5"> sides of their identity it's like</font>

00:42:21,559 --> 00:42:25,609
you know hey you know you fix the

blender or you fixed<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know you change</font>

1293
00:42:25,609 --> 00:42:28,880
the oil in your car this is as simple as

1294
00:42:27,229 --> 00:42:30,259
that like if you can bring out other

1295
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:30,950
thing out other things that in their

1296

lives

1297
00:42:30,950 --> 00:42:34,308
<font color="#CCCCCC">I'm just remind them that they're</font>

1298
00:42:32,630 --> 00:42:36,349
confident like that that matters it does

1299
00:42:34,309 --> 00:42:37,999
go a long way<font color="#CCCCCC"> and praise their success</font>

1300

when they<font color="#CCCCCC"> succeed</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> something</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm compare</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">it to you know standards used to come up</font>

1302
00:42:40,460 --> 00:42:44,539
with some sort of<font color="#E5E5E5"> standards for thinking</font>

1303
00:42:41,599 --> 00:42:46,069
about like how secure they could be and

1304
00:42:44,539 --> 00:42:47,329
then give them constructive feedback not

1305
00:42:46,069 --> 00:42:48,920
like don't ever do that you know

1306
00:42:47,329 --> 00:42:51,589
<font color="#CCCCCC">justjust</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> give them stuff that they can</font>

00:42:48,920 --> 00:42:52,880
build on<font color="#CCCCCC"> and i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> found this technique</font>

1308
00:42:51,589 --> 00:42:54,890
actually works really well this is not

clear<font color="#E5E5E5"> at all from what this is is a</font>

1318

device<font color="#CCCCCC"> he</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> took the ugliest oldest</font>

nastiest complicated<font color="#CCCCCC"> this machine he</font>

1320
00:43:17,479 --> 00:43:21,618
could and would take a long time fussing

1321
00:43:20,089 --> 00:43:23,538
over setting up and costs at it and be

1322
00:43:21,619 --> 00:43:25,339
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> August terrible machine and</font>

1323
00:43:23,539 --> 00:43:27,680
basically bring people around on his

1324
00:43:25,339 --> 00:43:28,969
side and be like you know like we're

1325
00:43:27,680 --> 00:43:32,058
both in this together against this

1326
00:43:28,969 --> 00:43:33,739
broken machine right so like<font color="#CCCCCC"> i said if</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">you if you go with the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> lion software is</font>

again that is hugely helpful because

00:43:36,380 --> 00:43:39,529
unless that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is really worked for me</font>

productive things he now is open enough

<font color="#E5E5E5">emphasize to people that it's not their</font>

00:44:09,109 --> 00:44:12,440
fault you know tell them that stuff is

1350
00:44:12,440 --> 00:44:14,450
broken and be like that's not your fault

1351
00:44:13,970 --> 00:44:17,629
<font color="#E5E5E5">right</font>

1352
00:44:14,450 --> 00:44:19,069
that helps a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> like I said you know</font>

1353
00:44:17,630 --> 00:44:21,769
keep<font color="#E5E5E5"> its salient talk about the stuff</font>

1354
00:44:19,069 --> 00:44:22,579
that's sort of specific to what they're

1355
00:44:21,769 --> 00:44:28,609
going through at that point in time

1356
00:44:22,579 --> 00:44:30,079
<font color="#E5E5E5">stereotype threat also sorry this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I love</font>

1357
00:44:28,609 --> 00:44:34,549
this slide is so useful for a lot of

1358
00:44:30,079 --> 00:44:36,440
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> one of the things that really and</font>

1359
00:44:34,549 --> 00:44:37,730
in all of this are all of us responsible

1360
00:44:36,440 --> 00:44:39,079
<font color="#E5E5E5">for this this is a very important</font>

1361
00:44:37,730 --> 00:44:41,509
concept you need to break yourself out

1362
00:44:39,079 --> 00:44:43,789
of because it's been proven to impair

1363
00:44:41,509 --> 00:44:45,829
student performance<font color="#E5E5E5"> when a student</font>

1364
00:44:43,789 --> 00:44:48,109
believes that they are inherently smart

1365
00:44:45,829 --> 00:44:49,759
and good at something that that's just

1366
00:44:48,109 --> 00:44:51,170
who they are<font color="#CCCCCC"> their genius</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they're gifted</font>

00:44:49,759 --> 00:44:53,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">they're talented</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they will actually</font>

1368
00:44:51,170 --> 00:44:55,339
perform more poorly than if they think

1369
00:44:53,210 --> 00:44:57,740
about how when they practice something

1370
00:44:55,339 --> 00:44:59,210
they improve at it right<font color="#E5E5E5"> that is</font>

1371
00:44:57,740 --> 00:45:00,799
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's like a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> across-the-board</font>

1372
00:44:59,210 --> 00:45:02,359
consistently if you emphasize to

1373
00:45:00,799 --> 00:45:04,490
students that how they're growing and

1374
00:45:02,359 --> 00:45:06,140
how<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're learning</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that's important so</font>

1375
00:45:04,490 --> 00:45:08,058
I think we need to stop talking about

1376
00:45:06,140 --> 00:45:10,279
the geniuses in this field<font color="#E5E5E5"> Steve</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Jobs</font>

1379
00:45:11,660 --> 00:45:15,109
stop it like that's not helping anybody

1380
00:45:13,730 --> 00:45:17,809
<font color="#E5E5E5">you're being</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a genius isn't helping</font>

1381
00:45:15,109 --> 00:45:20,359
anybody we all need to focus on you know

00:45:24,740 --> 00:45:28,519
mention<font color="#E5E5E5"> on some people sort of asking</font>

1386
00:45:27,170 --> 00:45:30,170
like how do we do this how do we get

1387

people around the way<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're thinking</font>

00:45:30,170 --> 00:45:33,680
when they have these really denialist

models of thinking about things<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> read</font>

1392
00:45:36,980 --> 00:45:40,099
really hope it works given the sort of

1393
00:45:38,599 --> 00:45:42,079
number of really terrible ideas are

1394
00:45:40,099 --> 00:45:43,369
going around out there<font color="#CCCCCC"> one of the most</font>

1395
00:45:42,079 --> 00:45:46,170
effective things apparently you can do

1396
00:45:43,369 --> 00:45:51,180
to get people to give up on<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

once again

work

1402
00:45:56,760 --> 00:46:00,780
have them spell it out and they may not

1403
00:45:58,200 --> 00:46:04,049
right in front of you go<font color="#E5E5E5"> oh no you're</font>

right but<font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> been proven</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that later on</font>

with a number of folks<font color="#CCCCCC"> lately</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> who came</font>

out of religious<font color="#E5E5E5"> fundamentalist families</font>

evolution and things like that and you

00:46:19,890 --> 00:46:24,450
know they'll you know it's a slow

process like<font color="#CCCCCC"> and one</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of the challenges</font>

thinking about systems biology<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

00:46:42,540 --> 00:46:47,790
the universe works and what your place

1424

<font color="#E5E5E5">in it is and so it's not easy to get</font>

1425
00:46:47,790 --> 00:46:50,790
people to sort of get out of these

1426
00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:53,100
models that don't match up with the

1427
00:46:50,790 --> 00:46:56,130
biological or technical systems or

1428
00:46:53,100 --> 00:46:58,950
governmental systems that we want them

1429
00:46:56,130 --> 00:47:00,360
to think about but it just takes<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

some shit<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

1481
00:48:36,559 --> 00:48:46,940
yes question so what do you do when

1482
00:48:41,450 --> 00:48:48,410
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't want to in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a cage or</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1483
00:48:46,940 --> 00:48:52,549
degree to which they<font color="#CCCCCC"> engage</font>

1484
00:48:48,410 --> 00:48:55,790
progressively gets less<font color="#E5E5E5"> like when they</font>

1485
00:48:52,549 --> 00:48:57,770
say<font color="#CCCCCC"> i have this problem fix it and you</font>

1486
00:48:55,790 --> 00:49:00,710
say<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay i'll teach you how I know I</font>

1487
00:48:57,770 --> 00:49:02,329
don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> time for that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> fix</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it or when</font>

1488
00:49:00,710 --> 00:49:04,160
they start swearing and saying how much

1489
00:49:02,329 --> 00:49:05,930
they hate it because<font color="#CCCCCC"> they</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> forgotten</font>

1490
00:49:04,160 --> 00:49:09,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">their password and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the issues</font>

1491
00:49:05,930 --> 00:49:10,910
that they<font color="#E5E5E5"> forgot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> your password</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> or</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they</font>

1492
00:49:09,020 --> 00:49:12,349
last words are hard like<font color="#CCCCCC"> acknowledged</font>

1493
00:49:10,910 --> 00:49:13,670
<font color="#CCCCCC">from</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the passwords are hard like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> human</font>

1494
00:49:12,349 --> 00:49:14,930
memories especially when we have to

1495
00:49:13,670 --> 00:49:16,730
remember so many of them and we're not

1496
00:49:14,930 --> 00:49:19,129
supposed to reuse them so like I would

1497
00:49:16,730 --> 00:49:21,200
say<font color="#CCCCCC"> acknowledge that like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they</font>

1498
00:49:19,130 --> 00:49:22,430
support<font color="#CCCCCC"> value set of known passwords</font>

1499
00:49:21,200 --> 00:49:24,770
yeah they don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> wanna bother going</font>

1500
00:49:22,430 --> 00:49:26,180
through them<font color="#CCCCCC"> and yeah well you know you</font>

1501
00:49:24,770 --> 00:49:27,589
can remind them you know distributed

1502
00:49:26,180 --> 00:49:28,910
cognition is a thing if they have a list

1503
00:49:27,589 --> 00:49:30,529
<font color="#E5E5E5">in the written down be like hey just go</font>

1504
00:49:28,910 --> 00:49:32,180
check<font color="#CCCCCC"> your list you know there is a</font>

1505
00:49:30,530 --> 00:49:35,059
password safe<font color="#CCCCCC"> i believe what is it one</font>

1506
00:49:32,180 --> 00:49:35,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">pass is that the ones</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 1password last</font>

1507
00:49:35,059 --> 00:49:37,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">last password</font>

1508
00:49:35,960 --> 00:49:39,049
<font color="#CCCCCC">yeah I tried sending more last yeah and</font>

1509
00:49:37,910 --> 00:49:40,430
<font color="#CCCCCC">that's that if they're not going to that</font>

1510
00:49:39,049 --> 00:49:41,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">I mean that one of the things sometimes</font>

1511
00:49:40,430 --> 00:49:42,919
maybe you just have to back away

1512
00:49:41,750 --> 00:49:45,470
you have to be like<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm gonna give</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

1513
00:49:42,920 --> 00:49:46,549
space to deal with this<font color="#CCCCCC"> if they really</font>

1514
00:49:45,470 --> 00:49:48,709
don't have time they really don't have

1515
00:49:46,549 --> 00:49:50,690
time<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know them and you can</font>

1516
00:49:48,710 --> 00:49:53,420
acknowledge that<font color="#E5E5E5"> but then once again</font>

1517
00:49:50,690 --> 00:49:54,559
like you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> emphasize other things</font>

1518
00:49:53,420 --> 00:49:56,299
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they've that they've done</font>

1519
00:49:54,559 --> 00:49:58,369
successfully<font color="#CCCCCC"> try to see</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if there's</font>

1520
00:49:56,299 --> 00:50:00,770
others things that they<font color="#CCCCCC"> used</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to remind</font>

1521
00:49:58,369 --> 00:50:02,569
themselves<font color="#E5E5E5"> right about things regularly</font>

1522
00:50:00,770 --> 00:50:04,819
<font color="#CCCCCC">if they're not using the password</font>

1523
00:50:02,569 --> 00:50:06,319
frequently then you know that's the sort

1524
00:50:04,819 --> 00:50:07,369
of thing like if you can suggest<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> them</font>

1525
00:50:06,319 --> 00:50:09,079
like maybe you want to practice this

1526
00:50:07,369 --> 00:50:11,000
like maybe instead of having<font color="#CCCCCC"> autosave</font>

1527
00:50:09,079 --> 00:50:12,680
password<font color="#CCCCCC"> maybe for a while just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> leave</font>

1528
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:14,030
so you have to type it in and then

1529
00:50:12,680 --> 00:50:15,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">you'll remember it like it may come</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> at</font>

1530
00:50:14,030 --> 00:50:17,300
<font color="#CCCCCC">come</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> back to little more easily so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> yep</font>

1531
00:50:15,890 --> 00:50:21,799
<font color="#CCCCCC">thank you</font>

1532
00:50:17,300 --> 00:50:23,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you talked a lot about how to</font>

1533
00:50:21,800 --> 00:50:24,770
communicate<font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the people on the other</font>

1534
00:50:23,570 --> 00:50:26,840
side<font color="#CCCCCC"> that people who</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are not technical</font>

1535
00:50:24,770 --> 00:50:29,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">and I want to kind of turn it 180</font>

1536
00:50:26,840 --> 00:50:30,680
degrees because<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you were doing all</font>

1537
00:50:29,180 --> 00:50:32,690
these<font color="#E5E5E5"> all these examples of people's</font>

1538
00:50:30,680 --> 00:50:34,910
mental models and you were<font color="#E5E5E5"> telling us</font>

1539
00:50:32,690 --> 00:50:36,590
okay this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're not stupid</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they are</font>

1540
00:50:34,910 --> 00:50:38,930
like acting although in all those

1541
00:50:36,590 --> 00:50:40,880
assumptions but you know we all kind of

1542
00:50:38,930 --> 00:50:42,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">said we grow into the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> kind</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> snickered</font>

professional as<font color="#E5E5E5"> as IT professionals it</font>

1545
00:50:45,470 --> 00:50:51,350
is our our job to not do that but on the

1546
00:50:50,180 --> 00:50:53,120
other hand<font color="#CCCCCC"> but i'll have all</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> those</font>

1547
00:50:51,350 --> 00:50:55,339
anecdotes and<font color="#E5E5E5"> all the stories that we</font>

1548
00:50:53,120 --> 00:50:59,330
tell each other<font color="#CCCCCC"> so what would you tell</font>

1549
00:50:55,340 --> 00:51:02,330
how<font color="#E5E5E5"> how should we change or how should</font>

00:50:59,330 --> 00:51:04,040
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> sure</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> uh</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> acknowledge that we have the</font>

1551
00:51:02,330 --> 00:51:07,910
tendency to you know how is their

1552
00:51:04,040 --> 00:51:10,640
<font color="#CCCCCC">brothers vs</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ask Gamzee sure</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one</font>

of the one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the things I can think of</font>

1554
00:51:10,640 --> 00:51:13,430
is is for my dissertation one of the

1555
00:51:12,230 --> 00:51:15,740
things I really had to do is come around

1556
00:51:13,430 --> 00:51:17,569
<font color="#E5E5E5">from being like what is wrong here to</font>

1557
00:51:15,740 --> 00:51:19,609
being like<font color="#CCCCCC"> what people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> fascinating like</font>

1558
00:51:17,570 --> 00:51:21,980
I'm really coming to<font color="#E5E5E5"> see like it's just</font>

1559
00:51:19,610 --> 00:51:23,270
um<font color="#CCCCCC"> I love watching things break and so</font>

1560
00:51:21,980 --> 00:51:24,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> anything it's just like witness</font>

1561
00:51:23,270 --> 00:51:26,720
marvelous and then try to figure out

1562
00:51:24,500 --> 00:51:28,160
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> rather than just laughing at it try</font>

1563
00:51:26,720 --> 00:51:29,120
to find the sense in it<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

1564
00:51:28,160 --> 00:51:31,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">really the thing that takes the</font>

1565
00:51:29,120 --> 00:51:33,529
definitely<font color="#CCCCCC"> take some work and sometimes</font>

1566
00:51:31,670 --> 00:51:35,510
you know it's just like bad habits like

1567
00:51:33,530 --> 00:51:37,430
I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's a guy at the UN who was</font>

1568
00:51:35,510 --> 00:51:38,990
breaking the shared server by taking the

1569
00:51:37,430 --> 00:51:40,730
entire folder off the server every time

1570
00:51:38,990 --> 00:51:43,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> needed</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one document and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> then copying</font>

1571
00:51:40,730 --> 00:51:48,050
it back to another place on the server

1572
00:51:43,580 --> 00:51:49,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">sir you are the problem</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> God</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but he was</font>

1573
00:51:48,050 --> 00:51:50,780
the only problem actually the<font color="#E5E5E5"> IT guy was</font>

1574
00:51:49,400 --> 00:51:51,170
also giving people a lot of a lot of

1575
00:51:50,780 --> 00:51:52,640
trouble

1576

1577
00:51:52,640 --> 00:51:56,720
just sort of finding the truth in it<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

1578
00:51:55,160 --> 00:51:58,399
had another<font color="#CCCCCC"> thought</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 5</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 45 minutes</font>

good old stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know going back to</font>

1590
00:52:22,070 --> 00:52:24,710
see more papers on

the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Apple classroom tomorrow</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> study was</font>

1592
00:52:24,710 --> 00:52:28,790
sort of good at a lot of levels but that

1593
00:52:26,330 --> 00:52:31,310
was sort of<font color="#E5E5E5"> high-level unfortunately</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

1594
00:52:28,790 --> 00:52:32,600
don't know<font color="#CCCCCC"> as many</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> as I'd like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I've sort</font>

of moved away from<font color="#CCCCCC"> my education</font>

1596
00:52:32,600 --> 00:52:35,960
specifically anybody in the audience

1597
00:52:33,830 --> 00:52:38,390
have one or two<font color="#CCCCCC"> to call out</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> books on</font>

1598
00:52:35,960 --> 00:52:39,740
technology<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think they</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> haven't been</font>

1599
00:52:38,390 --> 00:52:42,560
written<font color="#E5E5E5"> as possible that we should write</font>

1600
00:52:39,740 --> 00:52:43,759
them<font color="#CCCCCC"> on because i actually so I've</font>

1601
00:52:42,560 --> 00:52:44,810
actually been working on a project one

1602
00:52:43,760 --> 00:52:47,480
of the things i<font color="#E5E5E5"> wanted to do with mental</font>

1603
00:52:44,810 --> 00:52:51,470
models project was to try to encourage

1604
00:52:47,480 --> 00:52:53,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">education policy to stop being like push</font>

1605
00:52:51,470 --> 00:52:54,770
this button here and<font color="#CCCCCC"> Microsoft your kids</font>

1606
00:52:53,300 --> 00:52:57,230
need to learn to copy and paste and be

1607
00:52:54,770 --> 00:52:58,610
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we need to teach them of some</font>

1608
00:52:57,230 --> 00:53:00,530
really basic things about network

1609
00:52:58,610 --> 00:53:02,420
architecture because if we don't do that

1610
00:53:00,530 --> 00:53:04,010
possibly in civics class maybe because

1611
00:53:02,420 --> 00:53:05,810
then we could talk about digital rights

1612
00:53:04,010 --> 00:53:07,070
or you could do it<font color="#CCCCCC"> in coding class and</font>

1613
00:53:05,810 --> 00:53:08,330
then maybe when kids make code they

1614
00:53:07,070 --> 00:53:10,370
could actually put it up<font color="#E5E5E5"> for people</font>

1615
00:53:08,330 --> 00:53:11,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">could use it or you could do it with you</font>

1616
00:53:10,370 --> 00:53:13,250
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> your your media literacy or your</font>

1617
00:53:11,990 --> 00:53:15,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">English class your language arts class</font>

1618
00:53:13,250 --> 00:53:17,690
and say like it's important to learn<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

1619
00:53:15,680 --> 00:53:18,919
URL because here's what<font color="#CCCCCC"> URL</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can tell me</font>

1620
00:53:17,690 --> 00:53:21,620
about you about how somebody on

1621
00:53:18,920 --> 00:53:23,030
something so hopefully i will write that

1622
00:53:21,620 --> 00:53:24,140
up and then we can move on that and that

1623
00:53:23,030 --> 00:53:26,240
reminds me also

1624
00:53:24,140 --> 00:53:27,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">mozilla had a bunch of digital literacy</font>

1625
00:53:26,240 --> 00:53:28,640
standards that<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> helped contribute to a</font>

1626
00:53:27,740 --> 00:53:29,990
little while ago

1627
00:53:28,640 --> 00:53:30,950
those are worth looking up as well

1628
00:53:29,990 --> 00:53:33,379
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we came up with a</font>

1629
00:53:30,950 --> 00:53:35,629
document that was really nice<font color="#CCCCCC"> it would</font>

1630
00:53:33,380 --> 00:53:37,910
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> worth holding more educators to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> thank</font>

1631
