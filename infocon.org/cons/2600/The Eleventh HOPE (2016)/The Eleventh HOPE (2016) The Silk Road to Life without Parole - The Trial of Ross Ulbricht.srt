it was just you would learn that<font color="#CCCCCC"> there's</font>

393
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:24,870
just look at it as a drug thing the end

394
00:16:22,290 --> 00:16:27,480
goodbye<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it was clearly just so much</font>

395
00:16:24,870 --> 00:16:29,130
more to it and so I wasn't exactly

396
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:32,190
surprised by the<font color="#E5E5E5"> rogue ages i found out</font>

397
00:16:29,130 --> 00:16:33,870
about them<font color="#E5E5E5"> as the trial was unfolding</font>

398
00:16:32,190 --> 00:16:36,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">through another source that I had that</font>

00:16:33,870 --> 00:16:39,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">there's one major source</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the one</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

403
00:16:43,050 --> 00:16:47,520
clearly evident that this guy was up to

404
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:49,170
no good and and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> the the levels to</font>

405
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:52,140
which<font color="#E5E5E5"> he was actually a good</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> got more</font>

406
00:16:49,170 --> 00:16:54,750
and more labyrinthine<font color="#E5E5E5"> and go far beyond</font>

00:16:54,750 --> 00:16:59,610
the direct engagement he had even with

inciting these these<font color="#E5E5E5"> murder-for-hire</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">there were no murders it was all sort of</font>

411
00:17:01,530 --> 00:17:07,230
you know basically like sting ops and it

412
00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:08,819
was a scammer

413
00:17:07,230 --> 00:17:11,520
yeah exactly<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's kind of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> scams</font>

414
00:17:08,819 --> 00:17:14,010
basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of that was had been</font>

415
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:15,180
manufactured by the rogue<font color="#E5E5E5"> agent so you</font>

416
00:17:14,010 --> 00:17:16,500
know that the story just got more and

417
00:17:15,180 --> 00:17:17,699
more complicated and the people that I

418
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:19,290
knew inside the<font color="#CCCCCC"> silk road we're getting</font>

419
00:17:17,699 --> 00:17:20,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">more and more outraged by what they saw</font>

420
00:17:19,290 --> 00:17:23,730
because it just wasn't what they knew

421
00:17:20,790 --> 00:17:25,440
had happened and so it wasn't as if I i

422
00:17:23,730 --> 00:17:27,089
<font color="#CCCCCC">SAT there</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and when</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I know what's going</font>

on and<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> dammit no one</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> will tell the</font>

424
00:17:27,089 --> 00:17:30,300
truth you didn't really know what was

425
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:32,970
going on<font color="#E5E5E5"> was really hard to have any</font>

426
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:35,790
indication of what actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> concretely</font>

427
00:17:32,970 --> 00:17:37,350
had happened and I feel very unsatisfied

428
00:17:35,790 --> 00:17:38,149
the possibility that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I may never find</font>

429
00:17:37,350 --> 00:17:39,980
out no matter

430
00:17:38,150 --> 00:17:42,170
<font color="#CCCCCC">I know a lot more than most people do</font>

431
00:17:39,980 --> 00:17:44,840
and more than we were able to put<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">very very frustrating</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> only imagine</font>

what it was like for you<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> will put</font>

435
00:17:51,410 --> 00:17:57,320
you on the spot by making you<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about</font>

436
00:17:52,580 --> 00:17:59,030
that but<font color="#E5E5E5"> uh huh well it was really</font>

437
00:17:57,320 --> 00:18:01,129
bizarre having<font color="#CCCCCC"> i sat in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> every day of the</font>

438
00:17:59,030 --> 00:18:03,770
trial<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it was just like kind of</font>

439
00:18:01,130 --> 00:18:06,440
surreal to have had this impression that

440

you had like<font color="#E5E5E5"> Spence</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I wasn't six weeks</font>

after everything is over<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

out and you<font color="#CCCCCC"> learn that you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> guys had to</font>

453
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:40,670
keep that a secret how<font color="#E5E5E5"> do you not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> how</font>

454
00:18:39,020 --> 00:18:42,230
does it not come out and<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> right</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

00:18:42,230 --> 00:18:47,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">precluded from from using it but yeah</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

00:18:50,180 --> 00:18:54,380
could see that he was kind of like just

00:18:52,190 --> 00:18:56,570
boiling over with frustration as<font color="#E5E5E5"> thick</font>

461
00:18:54,380 --> 00:18:58,670
as<font color="#E5E5E5"> a trial went on and that certainly</font>

462
00:18:56,570 --> 00:19:00,320
helps to explain why any he did call for

463
00:18:58,670 --> 00:19:04,490
a mistrial how many times<font color="#E5E5E5"> like five or</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">six and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> nine few</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> times</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so we'll see</font>

465
00:19:04,490 --> 00:19:10,550
where this appeal goes but it does seem

466
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:12,590
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> there is an unusual amount of stuff</font>

467
00:19:10,550 --> 00:19:15,409
that could be a foothold for an appeal

468
00:19:12,590 --> 00:19:17,990
but<font color="#CCCCCC"> I am NOT a lawyer have no</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> idea</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> its I</font>

474
00:19:27,260 --> 00:19:32,840

wasn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> very interesting like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> series of</font>

00:19:42,980 --> 00:19:47,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">oh it was just like a leaky capture on</font>

the site that<font color="#E5E5E5"> reveal its IP address in</font>

00:19:47,390 --> 00:19:51,500
right and<font color="#CCCCCC"> that wasn't enough information</font>

483
00:19:50,030 --> 00:19:52,910
certainly so

484
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:54,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">there was enough that nobody in the tech</font>

485

community<font color="#E5E5E5"> bought it but is it was it was</font>

486
00:19:54,890 --> 00:20:01,370
like a just a very weird<font color="#E5E5E5"> explanation</font>

487
00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:02,900
yeah so they<font color="#E5E5E5"> in in connection with you</font>

488
00:20:01,370 --> 00:20:04,820
know we were raising a lot of questions

489
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:06,830
about how<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I mean just like Andy</font>

490
00:20:04,820 --> 00:20:09,050
said obviously the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Silk Road was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hosted</font>

491
00:20:06,830 --> 00:20:11,449
as a tor hidden service<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you know</font>

492
00:20:09,050 --> 00:20:13,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">their explanation was how we discovered</font>

493
00:20:11,450 --> 00:20:16,730
it through a leaky<font color="#E5E5E5"> CAPTCHA essentially</font>

494
00:20:13,340 --> 00:20:19,399
<font color="#E5E5E5">not as I visiting there is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a an FBI</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">Road</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I there's a capture that you needed</font>

503
00:20:35,930 --> 00:20:41,810

504
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:43,700
through a<font color="#E5E5E5"> capture to get onto the Silk</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">Road site and so he went on to the</font>

506
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:49,160
capture and typed in you know a bunch of

507
00:20:45,770 --> 00:20:55,070
stuff essentially like fuzzing type of

00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:57,380
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing and ultimately he had</font>

so having actually like looked at you

00:21:18,740 --> 00:21:25,250
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> looked at the configuration files</font>

520
00:21:25,250 --> 00:21:32,450
then<font color="#E5E5E5"> there that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the explanation that</font>

521
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:35,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">they gave was just you know it was</font>

522
00:21:32,450 --> 00:21:38,300
incredible<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that was you know largely</font>

523
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:40,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">I mean</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so one of the things that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I said</font>

524
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:41,930
as much in your response<font color="#E5E5E5"> right and then</font>

525
00:21:40,310 --> 00:21:43,940
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> their their response</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the years</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">to you're saying that well this doesn't</font>

527
00:21:43,940 --> 00:21:48,890
really make sense<font color="#E5E5E5"> was even better which</font>

528
00:21:45,590 --> 00:21:50,959
was just<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok fine so just just let's say</font>

529
00:21:48,890 --> 00:21:53,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">we did just hack the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> server's ok let's</font>

530
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:56,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> some even if we did that's not</font>

531
00:21:53,180 --> 00:21:59,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">illegal right because because all of</font>

532
00:21:56,720 --> 00:22:01,190
these because reasons including<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

00:21:59,180 --> 00:22:04,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">that the server is in a foreign country</font>

534
00:22:01,190 --> 00:22:04,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">and so we can do whatever we want it by</font>

535
00:22:04,130 --> 00:22:07,820
the way without

538
00:22:09,860 --> 00:22:16,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">laws vary</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> its shifting I mean there's</font>

00:22:16,820 --> 00:22:21,740
into other other cases but this you know

541
00:22:19,310 --> 00:22:24,020
the government saying<font color="#CCCCCC"> yeah we can hack</font>

545
00:22:28,130 --> 00:22:31,910
to be challenged<font color="#E5E5E5"> right</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i mean that they</font>

546
00:22:30,590 --> 00:22:33,290
didn't actually know where the server

547
00:22:31,910 --> 00:22:35,030
was because that's the whole idea of<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

tor hidden service<font color="#CCCCCC"> so the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> day they said</font>

557
00:22:49,820 --> 00:22:53,990

which is to say that you know because

so you know one of the things that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

572
00:23:20,630 --> 00:23:27,170
battled with<font color="#E5E5E5"> while I was making the film</font>

with various people including certain

that this was<font color="#CCCCCC"> the right it wasn't wholly</font>

00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:35,630
a<font color="#CCCCCC"> rights oriented story but there was a</font>

very big<font color="#E5E5E5"> rights component to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this story</font>

00:23:35,630 --> 00:23:40,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">and that it was a precedent-setting case</font>

579
00:23:38,690 --> 00:23:41,330
and people would argue that it wasn't

580
00:23:40,130 --> 00:23:43,580
because you're dealing with drugs and

the type of case of the government would

use to set precedent because it isn't

586
00:23:49,820 --> 00:23:54,530
unassailable because it isn't easy

the servers and you know you guys are

618

to prevent future people from doing it

913
00:37:02,380 --> 00:37:07,359
number of cases that have been coming

out<font color="#E5E5E5"> since the nineties and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm sure it</font>

915

happens in other areas as well<font color="#E5E5E5"> where you</font>

have evidence of an extraordinary

917

technical nature and you have a jury

918
00:37:14,799 --> 00:37:21,520
deciding what the outcome of that

919
00:37:17,829 --> 00:37:24,579
evidence should<font color="#CCCCCC"> did</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> should be and I</font>

on that jury has some idea of what that

the implication of that<font color="#E5E5E5"> that evidence is</font>

00:37:31,690 --> 00:37:38,380
right or<font color="#CCCCCC"> that again and so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm just</font>

00:37:34,390 --> 00:37:44,049
wondering<font color="#CCCCCC"> uh</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> apart from experts that are</font>

interrupted<font color="#E5E5E5"> so I'm just wondering what</font>

928
00:37:47,710 --> 00:37:52,329
<font color="#E5E5E5">as a defense attorney</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> able to do</font>

929
00:37:50,559 --> 00:37:55,779
to ensure that the jury is properly

educated about this<font color="#E5E5E5"> apart from having</font>

experts just in the courtroom

<font color="#E5E5E5">yeah</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that's that's also very politicized</font>

933
00:37:59,319 --> 00:38:03,220
right sure you have the<font color="#E5E5E5"> defendants</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

00:38:01,569 --> 00:38:05,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">the pointers experts they come in and</font>

936
00:38:05,650 --> 00:38:12,369
that's a that's one of the biggest

937
00:38:09,279 --> 00:38:14,619
challenges that we run into in<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know</font>

00:38:12,369 --> 00:38:16,839
<font color="#E5E5E5">I mean I you know frankly like I've</font>

00:38:14,619 --> 00:38:18,549

talking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> this but you know it's a</font>

00:38:22,630 --> 00:38:30,940
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a huge challenge in you know</font>

litigating<font color="#E5E5E5"> any you know technically</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">yeah i mean you can't necessarily ensure</font>

hard to prevent that don't they<font color="#E5E5E5"> only</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

is a technical<font color="#E5E5E5"> juror you know are they</font>

with us<font color="#E5E5E5"> are they against us you know how</font>

961
00:39:05,969 --> 00:39:12,179
do we want to present this information

to them<font color="#CCCCCC"> there's no</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you know there's no</font>

963
00:39:12,179 --> 00:39:18,089
simple answer to that question<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically</font>

964
00:39:14,189 --> 00:39:19,979
<font color="#E5E5E5">but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i think you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know in terms of helping</font>

jurors understand<font color="#CCCCCC"> I mean you just want</font>

966
00:39:19,979 --> 00:39:27,178
to kind of break break things down into

00:39:24,149 --> 00:39:29,459
you know some<font color="#CCCCCC"> bite</font>

968

<font color="#CCCCCC">ey te size pieces that you know there</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">will be able to to digest and you know</font>

970
00:39:33,059 --> 00:39:38,429
you may want to do that through experts

971
00:39:34,499 --> 00:39:44,129
or<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah it's a complex question</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of but</font>

972
00:39:38,429 --> 00:39:45,839
<font color="#CCCCCC">it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> certainly you know I appreciate the i</font>

973
00:39:44,130 --> 00:39:48,149
guess the gravity of<font color="#E5E5E5"> that question</font>

974
00:39:45,839 --> 00:39:49,859
it felt on<font color="#E5E5E5"> again as an observer that was</font>

975
00:39:48,149 --> 00:39:51,569
really missing on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Silk Road case was</font>

976
00:39:49,859 --> 00:39:53,399
a willingness on the part of the judge

977
00:39:51,569 --> 00:39:55,019
to allow there to be communication to

978
00:39:53,399 --> 00:39:56,819
the jury as to what<font color="#E5E5E5"> how this stuff</font>

979
00:39:55,019 --> 00:39:59,758
worked because<font color="#CCCCCC"> i don't think that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

980
00:39:56,819 --> 00:40:01,469
can make the presumption that people

will understand<font color="#E5E5E5"> this stuff especially in</font>

00:40:01,469 --> 00:40:06,239
a case like<font color="#CCCCCC"> silk road which is genuinely</font>

00:40:03,209 --> 00:40:07,979
complicated<font color="#E5E5E5"> on that the jury will</font>

00:40:06,239 --> 00:40:11,729
understand<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really incumbent upon</font>

985
00:40:07,979 --> 00:40:13,678
the court to make sure that the jury has

986
00:40:11,729 --> 00:40:15,328
<font color="#E5E5E5">got enough information in hand to have a</font>

grasp of what happened to the best of

really powerful evidence against<font color="#E5E5E5"> Ross in</font>

993
00:40:29,519 --> 00:40:32,758
the case like I think we just have to

994
00:40:30,899 --> 00:40:35,909
admit that<font color="#CCCCCC"> that they did seize his</font>

be explained<font color="#E5E5E5"> to jurors and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they can and</font>

the facts of the case and they came to<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

1003
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:55,050
conclusion<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> three-and-a-half hours</font>

1004
00:40:52,770 --> 00:40:57,840
which is was just a little like trouble

1005
00:40:55,050 --> 00:41:00,150
disturbingly<font color="#E5E5E5"> fast for a case this</font>

1006
00:40:57,840 --> 00:41:02,340
complex<font color="#CCCCCC"> so you got the impression that</font>

like<font color="#E5E5E5"> with that short</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> time</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> frame</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they</font>

00:41:02,340 --> 00:41:06,150
probably<font color="#CCCCCC"> were thinking a little more</font>

1009
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:10,440
about like the<font color="#E5E5E5"> murder accusations and</font>

they were about you know the the chain

of custody of the logs that<font color="#CCCCCC"> had been you</font>

the opportunity to hear you know some

the best of ability in explaining them

the technical explanations weren't

1229
00:49:53,700 --> 00:49:59,460
back from that so one of the issues that

1230
00:49:56,310 --> 00:50:01,590
were raised on appeal we had to defense

1231

experts that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know wanted to put</font>

on one explaining<font color="#CCCCCC"> Bitcoin and especially</font>

1233
00:50:06,510 --> 00:50:10,830
in the context of some of the testimony

1234
00:50:09,330 --> 00:50:16,350
that the government was permitted to put

1235
00:50:10,830 --> 00:50:18,569
on with an expert that they you know

<font color="#E5E5E5">hired in the middle of the trial to</font>

1238
00:50:21,210 --> 00:50:28,350

00:50:23,910 --> 00:50:30,629
essentially like it<font color="#E5E5E5"> i would say maybe 24</font>

1240
00:50:28,350 --> 00:50:32,130
hours before that given notice that this

person was going to be testifying and

1242

what the<font color="#CCCCCC"> and you know received thousands</font>

forensics<font color="#E5E5E5"> anyway we were precluded from</font>

1247
00:50:46,500 --> 00:50:50,940
putting on either one of the experts

1248
00:50:48,930 --> 00:50:56,339
that we know intended to call and so

1249
00:50:50,940 --> 00:50:58,320
yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> in that context I think that the</font>

1250
00:50:56,340 --> 00:51:01,080
explanation that we were able to provide

1251

to the jury was<font color="#E5E5E5"> was insufficient because</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">we were not able to call the experts</font>

that we wanted to and<font color="#E5E5E5"> do you have this</font>

1254
00:51:05,580 --> 00:51:08,580
is obviously conjecture what do you

1255
00:51:07,590 --> 00:51:12,450
think it was a case of jury

1256
