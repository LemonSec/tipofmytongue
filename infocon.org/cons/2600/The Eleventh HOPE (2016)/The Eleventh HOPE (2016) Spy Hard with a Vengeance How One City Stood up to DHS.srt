doing fantastic work to try to bridge

lawyers<font color="#E5E5E5"> it was weird</font>

36
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:23,548
so one of the things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> will get</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> into</font>

37
00:01:20,909 --> 00:01:24,990
is that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we had basically called action</font>

38
00:01:23,549 --> 00:01:26,580
because a lot of crazy things<font color="#CCCCCC"> begin to</font>

39
00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:28,589
happen and the citizens of<font color="#CCCCCC"> Oakland</font>

00:01:50,850 --> 00:01:54,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">Brian was actually the chair of the</font>

workshop after this we get into the

legal<font color="#E5E5E5"> nitty-gritty for people that are</font>

57
00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:08,890
interested<font color="#CCCCCC"> the policy was how do you say</font>

58
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:11,740
was it enacted<font color="#CCCCCC"> into law</font>

59
00:02:08,889 --> 00:02:14,440
our ordinance or what is the term<font color="#CCCCCC"> yes</font>

60
00:02:11,740 --> 00:02:15,550
it's an ordinance which is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> municipal</font>

61
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:17,829
version<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a law</font>

62

<font color="#CCCCCC">okay i didn't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know that so it is an</font>

63
00:02:17,830 --> 00:02:22,540
ordinance as of about a year ago and

64
00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:25,360
we're also<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to cover a little bit</font>

65
00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:27,220
of the effects and socially and legally

66
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:29,800
that this policy has had over the last

67
00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:31,600
year and some interesting updates<font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font>

68
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:34,270
that's kind of the the summary of the

69
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:36,190
talk and<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get straight to the point</font>

70
00:02:34,270 --> 00:02:38,080
fantasy has become reality and what<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

71
00:02:36,190 --> 00:02:42,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">mean by</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this how many of you have heard</font>

72
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:43,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">of the website Facebook ok</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I did there's</font>

73
00:02:42,190 --> 00:02:46,570
one or two maybe

74
00:02:43,390 --> 00:02:48,760
so if you think about it back in the

75
00:02:46,570 --> 00:02:49,540
dark ages before<font color="#CCCCCC"> Facebook aka the</font>

76
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:54,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">internet</font>

77
00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:57,340
<font color="#CCCCCC">um</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah when you would go to like say</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

78
00:02:54,820 --> 00:02:58,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">university and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you didn't really know</font>

79
00:02:57,340 --> 00:03:00,190
how to meet each other and they would

80
00:02:58,690 --> 00:03:01,900
have these things called<font color="#CCCCCC"> Facebook's the</font>

81
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:03,280
<font color="#CCCCCC">yearbook</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> serve the same purposes it's a</font>

82
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:06,580
way that you can find out who each other

83
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:08,530
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> and in these dark ages all of us had</font>

84
00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:10,000
dreams of how things could be and what

85
00:03:08,530 --> 00:03:11,980
could we use technology for in the

86
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,870
future<font color="#E5E5E5"> and this is we see this reflected</font>

87
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:15,730
inside from the forties and fifties as

88
00:03:13,870 --> 00:03:17,799
well<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we had a lot of really cool</font>

89
00:03:15,730 --> 00:03:20,560
ideas and imaginations about it and now

90
00:03:17,799 --> 00:03:23,799
it's a reality so here's the problem

91
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:27,280
<font color="#CCCCCC">um</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> law enforcement has this reality</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> two</font>

92
00:03:23,799 --> 00:03:29,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">and one of the problems with this is the</font>

93
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:31,030
<font color="#CCCCCC">beltway law enforcement has been using</font>

94
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:33,160
these technologies<font color="#CCCCCC"> disrupt</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> something</font>

95
00:03:31,030 --> 00:03:36,549
called the social contract at the social

96
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:38,620
contract by which<font color="#E5E5E5"> i mean if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you're ever</font>

97
00:03:36,549 --> 00:03:40,480
seen on a police car that sign that says

98
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:42,670
to serve and protect<font color="#E5E5E5"> the other supposed</font>

99
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:44,380
to work for us<font color="#E5E5E5"> and clearly that's not</font>

100
00:03:42,670 --> 00:03:47,440
working we've seen a lot of issues that

101
00:03:44,380 --> 00:03:48,549
<font color="#E5E5E5">police lately and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i think that one of</font>

102
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:50,320
the things we want to do is encourage

103
00:03:48,549 --> 00:03:52,239
people that it's time to fight back and

104
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:54,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">yeah there's this there's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a hierarchy</font>

105
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:55,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">where the government works for the</font>

106
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:58,060
people and the police work for the

107
00:03:55,630 --> 00:03:59,530
government<font color="#CCCCCC"> so I say instead of going to</font>

108
00:03:58,060 --> 00:04:00,790
the police let's bypass them and go

109
00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:06,489
straight to the government and that's

110
00:04:00,790 --> 00:04:08,048
kind of what we did<font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> come on we're</font>

111
00:04:06,489 --> 00:04:10,329
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to teach you how to stop it</font>

112
00:04:08,049 --> 00:04:11,799
we spent a<font color="#E5E5E5"> over a year actually the</font>

113
00:04:10,329 --> 00:04:14,230
things are<font color="#CCCCCC"> presented</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it is the</font>

114
00:04:11,799 --> 00:04:16,239
culmination of several years of work and

115
00:04:14,230 --> 00:04:19,089
deliberations and cut uncovering a bunch

116
00:04:16,238 --> 00:04:20,700
of really interesting things and one of

117
00:04:19,089 --> 00:04:22,560
our goals is<font color="#CCCCCC"> at h</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and everyone</font>

themselves

123
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:37,920
I can say this<font color="#E5E5E5"> because</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not the</font>

00:05:04,590 --> 00:05:08,190
things go wrong and it raises a bunch of

138
00:05:06,390 --> 00:05:09,780
interesting moral and ethical questions

139
00:05:08,190 --> 00:05:11,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">one of the other interesting things</font>

140
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:15,150
about<font color="#CCCCCC"> the show is that it takes place</font>

198
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:28,370
introductory question we want to ask as

199
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:29,870
well<font color="#CCCCCC"> why Oakland why would the DHS even</font>

200
00:07:28,370 --> 00:07:31,789
<font color="#CCCCCC">approach open</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> well it turns out that</font>

201
00:07:29,870 --> 00:07:33,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">Oakland</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is a massive international port</font>

202
00:07:31,789 --> 00:07:35,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">of the sixth-biggest</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> north america</font>

203
00:07:33,410 --> 00:07:36,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">and there's two reasons this becomes</font>

204
00:07:35,690 --> 00:07:38,570
interesting

205
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:40,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">first there is a genuine valid security</font>

206
00:07:38,570 --> 00:07:42,110
concern about things come in and you

207
00:07:40,550 --> 00:07:43,190
know that you have cargo ships from all

208
00:07:42,110 --> 00:07:45,950
over the world that are coming into

209
00:07:43,190 --> 00:07:47,719
<font color="#CCCCCC">oakland</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we don't actually we were with</font>

210
00:07:45,950 --> 00:07:49,669
<font color="#E5E5E5">we want to make sure that everything</font>

211
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:51,260
that comes in<font color="#E5E5E5"> there is safe</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font>

212
00:07:49,669 --> 00:07:52,609
want to see like nuclear weapons we

213
00:07:51,260 --> 00:07:54,590
don't want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see contraband and so on</font>

214
00:07:52,610 --> 00:07:56,270
so it actually makes a lot of sense that

215
00:07:54,590 --> 00:07:57,080
you want to have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> enhance security at</font>

216
00:07:56,270 --> 00:07:58,250
the port

217
00:07:57,080 --> 00:08:00,050
the other thing that makes this really

218
00:07:58,250 --> 00:08:02,450
interesting is that because it's an

219
00:08:00,050 --> 00:08:04,669
international port<font color="#CCCCCC"> the jurisdiction gets</font>

220
00:08:02,450 --> 00:08:06,200
really interesting so the<font color="#CCCCCC"> City of</font>

221
00:08:04,669 --> 00:08:08,090
<font color="#CCCCCC">Oakland has its own jurisdiction in the</font>

222
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:09,950
port has its own weird legal

223
00:08:08,090 --> 00:08:13,549
<font color="#CCCCCC">international jurisdiction that brian</font>

224
00:08:09,950 --> 00:08:15,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">kim</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> two more another issue with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Oakland</font>

225
00:08:13,550 --> 00:08:17,750
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a maybe you've heard of groups like</font>

226
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:18,410
the Black Panthers or occupy<font color="#CCCCCC"> oakland and</font>

227
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:20,419
so on

228
00:08:18,410 --> 00:08:23,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">um Oakland does</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have major problems with</font>

229
00:08:20,419 --> 00:08:25,650
crime<font color="#E5E5E5"> and there's also a budget concerns</font>

230
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:27,330
so if you think about put yourself in a

231
00:08:25,650 --> 00:08:29,130
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> seat</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of one of the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> City Council</font>

232
00:08:27,330 --> 00:08:30,330
members<font color="#E5E5E5"> and let's say that you're</font>

233
00:08:29,130 --> 00:08:33,088
getting a lot of complaints from your

234
00:08:30,330 --> 00:08:34,559
district about incidents<font color="#CCCCCC"> happening</font>

235
00:08:33,089 --> 00:08:35,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">break-ins and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> whatnot</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and you're like</font>

236
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:38,069
well we<font color="#E5E5E5"> gotta do something to solve this</font>

237
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:40,529
<font color="#E5E5E5">and then somebody from DHS or one of</font>

238
00:08:38,070 --> 00:08:41,849
their shadow government groups<font color="#E5E5E5"> comes</font>

239
00:08:40,529 --> 00:08:43,830
along and says hey<font color="#CCCCCC"> will give you this</font>

240
00:08:41,849 --> 00:08:45,570
huge bundle of money to install the

241
00:08:43,830 --> 00:08:47,279
surveillance system to cut down on crime

242
00:08:45,570 --> 00:08:48,570
and you can run on your<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know one of</font>

243
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:49,260
the safety candidates for the next

244
00:08:48,570 --> 00:08:50,760
election

245
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:51,930
now the problem with this is that

246
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:54,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">Oakland also has a really strong</font>

247
00:08:51,930 --> 00:08:56,609
activism community and when they<font color="#CCCCCC"> learned</font>

248
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:58,500
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> this as we will see they fought</font>

249
00:08:56,610 --> 00:09:00,930
back against it so suddenly<font color="#CCCCCC"> you've got</font>

250
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:04,230
kind of a<font color="#E5E5E5"> catch-22 because if you</font>

251
00:09:00,930 --> 00:09:05,880
implement this security apparatus<font color="#CCCCCC"> then</font>

252
00:09:04,230 --> 00:09:07,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay great you're cutting down on crime</font>

253
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:10,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">however you're violating civil liberties</font>

254
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:12,810
and getting a lot of negative press<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok</font>

255
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:14,400
so let's respect<font color="#CCCCCC"> civil liberties well</font>

256
00:09:12,810 --> 00:09:15,569
suddenly you're soft on crime<font color="#CCCCCC"> and your</font>

257
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:17,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">opponent's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> going to hammer you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in the</font>

258
00:09:15,570 --> 00:09:21,450
election<font color="#CCCCCC"> so this kind of created this</font>

259
00:09:17,430 --> 00:09:23,040
gridlock<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the other thing is you may</font>

260
00:09:21,450 --> 00:09:24,300
have noticed in the news that<font color="#E5E5E5"> Oakland</font>

261
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:27,390
has a bit of a problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> called the</font>

262
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:30,510
Oakland Police Department<font color="#E5E5E5"> so this is a</font>

263
00:09:27,390 --> 00:09:33,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">long-standing issue this is back</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe</font>

264
00:09:30,510 --> 00:09:37,080
people remember what

265
00:09:33,390 --> 00:09:39,270
oh yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> uh what I was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to suggest</font>

266
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:40,980
is that<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's nothing new</font>

267
00:09:39,270 --> 00:09:45,569

charges against the police department if

302
00:10:52,690 --> 00:10:56,350

00:11:06,460 --> 00:11:11,440

monitoring<font color="#CCCCCC"> yeah so basically the police</font>

332
00:11:57,490 --> 00:12:00,520
are not behaving themselves<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the</font>

333
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:01,900
federal government has to step down and

334
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:04,660
whip them into shape and<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're clearly</font>

335
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:06,760
that's clearly not working either<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

336
00:12:04,660 --> 00:12:08,290
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of a background</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> where</font>

00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:10,450
<font color="#CCCCCC">we're coming</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> from and why people are</font>

338
00:12:08,290 --> 00:12:12,280
rightfully pissed off and it actually if

339
00:12:10,450 --> 00:12:13,900
you see the very bottom of that news

340
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:15,699
article<font color="#CCCCCC"> it mentions that one of the</font>

341
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:16,959
other reasons is because the police have

342
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:18,760
been accused of like planting evidence

343
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:21,840
to like wrongfully convicted people and

344
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:23,700
such<font color="#E5E5E5"> so fast forward</font>

345
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:25,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">to the timeline of events that went into</font>

00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:27,960
the surveillance<font color="#CCCCCC"> Center the city is</font>

347
00:12:25,230 --> 00:12:30,240
trying to push on us<font color="#E5E5E5"> so back in this</font>

348
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:31,680
goes all the way back to like<font color="#CCCCCC"> 2,000 i'm</font>

349
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:34,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">probably earlier than that</font>

350
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:35,910
so this is when an agreement between the

351
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:37,290
city of oakland<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the port of oakland</font>

352
00:12:35,910 --> 00:12:39,000
remember<font color="#E5E5E5"> how I said</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there's the</font>

353
00:12:37,290 --> 00:12:40,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">International jurisdiction of the port</font>

354
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,390
and then the separate jurisdiction of

355
00:12:40,380 --> 00:12:45,420
the city so they<font color="#E5E5E5"> had to have this</font>

356
00:12:42,390 --> 00:12:47,880
memorandum of agreement<font color="#CCCCCC"> a legal</font>

357
00:12:45,420 --> 00:12:49,560
structure and it created the<font color="#CCCCCC"> fruit</font>

358
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:51,210
groundwork for what became what we call

359
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:53,339
the domain awareness<font color="#E5E5E5"> center or as well</font>

00:12:51,210 --> 00:12:54,810
refer to<font color="#E5E5E5"> witness to talk the deck</font>

361
00:12:53,340 --> 00:12:56,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">fast forward a little bit and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they get</font>

362
00:12:54,810 --> 00:12:59,489
the grant money that we mentioned before

363
00:12:56,580 --> 00:13:00,930
and a little bit more and it starts to

364
00:12:59,490 --> 00:13:02,700
get into some of the legal structures as

365
00:13:00,930 --> 00:13:04,050
<font color="#CCCCCC">it's growing some legs one thing i want</font>

366
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:06,210
to point out because a lot of people are

367
00:13:04,050 --> 00:13:07,709
thinking maybe<font color="#CCCCCC"> well why did this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> take so</font>

368
00:13:06,210 --> 00:13:09,600
long to do anything I mean government

369
00:13:07,710 --> 00:13:11,250
was slow but not that slow why wasn't

370
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:14,490
there a public outcry before

371
00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:17,310
well if you can see on the screen shot

372
00:13:14,490 --> 00:13:19,080
i've included<font color="#E5E5E5"> there but what is it that</font>

373
00:13:17,310 --> 00:13:21,989
the item title for this thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> eventually</font>

00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:31,740
fall asleep reading that and maybe this

378
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:33,420
is a tactic of<font color="#CCCCCC"> lake when</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> by being really</font>

386
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:51,840
there something you want to add to this

also<font color="#E5E5E5"> something to note</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> at the very end</font>

530
00:20:10,230 --> 00:20:13,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">they</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> mentioned</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this bit about private</font>

532
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:18,960
something about<font color="#CCCCCC"> saic earlier</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so let's</font>

533
00:20:15,870 --> 00:20:22,590
see if this goes right<font color="#E5E5E5"> so this gets fun</font>

534
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:24,030
<font color="#CCCCCC">and this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is also why local citizens do</font>

535
00:20:22,590 --> 00:20:27,030
your research find out what the law

out that<font color="#E5E5E5"> what in the late eighties I</font>

538
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:33,360
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> Josh didn't separate</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> again in the</font>

544
00:20:44,610 --> 00:20:48,330
just did a Google search<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretended not</font>

00:20:47,220 --> 00:20:49,710
to find<font color="#E5E5E5"> any this is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

546
00:20:48,330 --> 00:20:51,570
the whole research is a screenshot of

547
00:20:49,710 --> 00:20:53,070
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> google search for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ya day they said</font>

this in public<font color="#CCCCCC"> areas</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that they just did</font>

549
00:20:53,070 --> 00:20:59,519
a<font color="#CCCCCC"> google search and they</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just awarded</font>

00:20:59,519 --> 00:21:03,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">yeah so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> let's look</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at what happens</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> next</font>

552
00:21:01,710 --> 00:21:05,730
is even more interesting because they

553
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:07,229
said<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> will</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> basically I think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Josh</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> went</font>

554
00:21:05,730 --> 00:21:09,059
to the the East was the east bay express

555
00:21:07,230 --> 00:21:11,190
or somebody else went to the media and

556
00:21:09,059 --> 00:21:12,690
all this news came out that<font color="#CCCCCC"> holy shit</font>

557
00:21:11,190 --> 00:21:14,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">we've just signed a contract with an</font>

563
00:21:23,669 --> 00:21:27,570
and others have successfully done and

564
00:21:25,799 --> 00:21:30,330
what we encourage you guys to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do is use</font>

565
00:21:27,570 --> 00:21:32,309
<font color="#E5E5E5">a public records request</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we basically</font>

566
00:21:30,330 --> 00:21:34,620
got the entire document dump for this

567
00:21:32,309 --> 00:21:37,260
project<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that's when we started going</font>

568
00:21:34,620 --> 00:21:39,059
through you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> the internal emails and</font>

569
00:21:37,260 --> 00:21:40,440
seeing that it wasn't about public

570
00:21:39,059 --> 00:21:43,350
safety but they were specifically

571
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:44,880
mentioning<font color="#E5E5E5"> occupy</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> oakland</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and that's</font>

572
00:21:43,350 --> 00:21:47,668
where we were able to start showing the

573
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:49,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">First Amendment impact of this project</font>

574
00:21:47,669 --> 00:21:51,389
and and that's what really started

575
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:53,700
getting media attention<font color="#E5E5E5"> and one other</font>

576
00:21:51,389 --> 00:21:55,740
thing to add to that is to just just

577
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:57,870
demonstrate how shitty<font color="#CCCCCC"> their research</font>

578
00:21:55,740 --> 00:22:00,630
capabilities<font color="#E5E5E5"> seem to be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> or efforts and</font>

579
00:21:57,870 --> 00:22:02,760
whatnot<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they had this complex so they</font>

580
00:22:00,630 --> 00:22:03,960
clearly had to drop<font color="#CCCCCC"> saic as a contractor</font>

581
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:06,570
because they couldn't do any work with

582
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:08,850
them so later on they<font color="#E5E5E5"> decided</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> around to</font>

583
00:22:06,570 --> 00:22:11,070
pick up another contractor called

584
00:22:08,850 --> 00:22:12,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">schneider electric</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and we did some more</font>

585
00:22:11,070 --> 00:22:14,250
digging it turns out<font color="#CCCCCC"> schneider electric</font>

586
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:17,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">is also involved in nuclear munitions</font>

587
00:22:14,250 --> 00:22:19,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">and at that point</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Oakland I believe they</font>

588
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:21,029
were considering whether they wanted a

589
00:22:19,620 --> 00:22:22,830
way that<font color="#E5E5E5"> or not but you can't do that</font>

590
00:22:21,029 --> 00:22:24,570
because it opens<font color="#E5E5E5"> you up to a lawsuit so</font>

591
00:22:22,830 --> 00:22:26,519
<font color="#E5E5E5">Oakland was basically fucked because</font>

592
00:22:24,570 --> 00:22:28,500
they need to do this<font color="#E5E5E5"> but they don't</font>

593
00:22:26,519 --> 00:22:30,630
actually have a means by which do it<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

594
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:31,260
thank you occupy<font color="#CCCCCC"> oakland privacy for</font>

595
00:22:30,630 --> 00:22:34,320
that

596
00:22:31,260 --> 00:22:36,480
so the next<font color="#E5E5E5"> slide</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm going to get into</font>

597
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:39,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">this this this one was funny remember</font>

600
00:22:42,690 --> 00:22:46,559
we're spending time doing research<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

601
00:22:44,730 --> 00:22:48,299
<font color="#CCCCCC">meantime City Council is trying to get</font>

00:22:46,559 --> 00:22:49,918
themselves together so the next time the

603
00:22:48,299 --> 00:22:53,429
item<font color="#E5E5E5"> came up on the agenda was in march</font>

610
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:10,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">Oakland privacy and we were threatening</font>

611
00:23:08,210 --> 00:23:13,940
a lawsuit over the<font color="#E5E5E5"> the anti-nuclear</font>

including the<font color="#E5E5E5"> larger labor unions</font>

00:24:19,220 --> 00:24:25,010
was impossible to ignore that point but

657
00:24:54,710 --> 00:24:58,370
couple reasons for us and one of them is

658
00:24:56,270 --> 00:25:01,370
that if you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> people who are on a</font>

00:24:58,370 --> 00:25:03,500
list<font color="#CCCCCC"> uh they</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> basically get to speak and</font>

660
00:25:01,370 --> 00:25:05,540
we can also seed time so that if you're

661
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:07,700
up on stage and you're trying to say

662

something<font color="#CCCCCC"> to City Hall City Council</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

664
00:25:09,140 --> 00:25:12,710
also on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> list can see their time to</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">there's</font>

667

up to us<font color="#CCCCCC"> we are just showing up if you</font>

00:25:25,100 --> 00:25:29,959
great way that you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> wait</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it and what</font>

end of it<font color="#CCCCCC"> we saw was called the Brooks</font>

resolution that was deadly<font color="#CCCCCC"> Brooks she</font>

705
00:26:51,740 --> 00:26:56,930
basically said<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> need to do</font>

706
00:26:53,690 --> 00:26:59,630
something and let's step back and think

707
00:26:56,930 --> 00:27:01,520
about this and<font color="#CCCCCC"> number one restricted the</font>

708
00:26:59,630 --> 00:27:03,650
deck<font color="#E5E5E5"> geographically to the port only</font>

709
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:05,420
remember that the<font color="#E5E5E5"> all these items over</font>

710
00:27:03,650 --> 00:27:07,520
the past years are trying to expand more

711
00:27:05,420 --> 00:27:08,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">and more vicious pushed it all the way</font>

712
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:11,930
back to the beginning<font color="#CCCCCC"> I can't actually</font>

713
00:27:08,870 --> 00:27:14,570
think of<font color="#E5E5E5"> any a lake city council</font>

714
00:27:11,930 --> 00:27:16,610
decision it in modern US history that

715
00:27:14,570 --> 00:27:19,340
has done this so that alone is worth

716
00:27:16,610 --> 00:27:21,229
commendation and within that same bullet

717
00:27:19,340 --> 00:27:24,199
point<font color="#E5E5E5"> facial recognition</font>

00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:28,610
removed<font color="#CCCCCC"> they</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> basically had the same</font>

721
00:27:28,610 --> 00:27:31,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">yeah so basically they had a couple of</font>

722
00:27:30,470 --> 00:27:33,470
things that they had<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> disable and</font>

723
00:27:31,790 --> 00:27:35,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">there's still disabled as far as i know</font>

724
00:27:33,470 --> 00:27:37,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> number two and I included this and</font>

725
00:27:35,870 --> 00:27:41,209
<font color="#CCCCCC">it's full text because you wouldn't</font>

726
00:27:37,970 --> 00:27:43,940
believe that otherwise<font color="#CCCCCC"> arm and something</font>

727
00:27:41,210 --> 00:27:46,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think is very useful for everyone</font>

728
00:27:43,940 --> 00:27:48,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">here</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the difference between data and</font>

729
00:27:46,010 --> 00:27:49,970
information is very misunderstood<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

730
00:27:48,350 --> 00:27:53,090
very important and the example I could

731
00:27:49,970 --> 00:27:55,250
use is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you have a phone and you</font>

732
00:27:53,090 --> 00:27:57,709
take a picture to upload to<font color="#CCCCCC"> Facebook</font>

733
00:27:55,250 --> 00:27:59,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">that's data collection if Facebook them</font>

734
00:27:57,710 --> 00:28:02,059
takes<font color="#CCCCCC"> it and like just extract</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

735
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:04,428
<font color="#E5E5E5">facial recognition</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> determine</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so it adds</font>

736
00:28:02,059 --> 00:28:05,928
the text to it that's information<font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font>

737
00:28:04,429 --> 00:28:07,400
it's basically you have the raw data

738
00:28:05,929 --> 00:28:09,650
that comes in and there's some kind of a

739
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:12,679
process that creates more data out of it

740
00:28:09,650 --> 00:28:14,059
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> yet so data shirt and</font>

741
00:28:12,679 --> 00:28:16,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">information-sharing are actually very</font>

742
00:28:14,059 --> 00:28:19,370
very different<font color="#E5E5E5"> and as you can see here</font>

743
00:28:16,580 --> 00:28:21,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">this basically said no data sharing with</font>

744
00:28:19,370 --> 00:28:23,299
any local state or federal agency

745
00:28:21,620 --> 00:28:24,860
without a written memorandum of

746
00:28:23,299 --> 00:28:27,110
understanding<font color="#CCCCCC"> that memorandum of</font>

747
00:28:24,860 --> 00:28:30,080
understanding that which basically means

748
00:28:27,110 --> 00:28:32,600
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you can do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> dat shirt like we do</font>

749
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:34,370
want to help<font color="#CCCCCC"> public</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> safety</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> but we want</font>

750
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:36,799
to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> a transparently and in the public</font>

751
00:28:34,370 --> 00:28:38,540
eye and I'm not actually aware of

752
00:28:36,799 --> 00:28:40,970
anything else like this<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe your butt</font>

753
00:28:38,540 --> 00:28:42,678
and then the next one this is really

754
00:28:40,970 --> 00:28:45,740
great because in the policy we have a

755
00:28:42,679 --> 00:28:47,750
very uh very robustly delineating list

756
00:28:45,740 --> 00:28:50,090
of all the technologies that count as

757
00:28:47,750 --> 00:28:51,980
part of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Oakland axis system</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that was</font>

758
00:28:50,090 --> 00:28:54,379
like a month's worth of the meetings<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

759
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:56,210
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> council</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> figure that out and this is</font>

760
00:28:54,380 --> 00:28:58,790
no new systems can be added without

761
00:28:56,210 --> 00:29:01,100
council approval<font color="#CCCCCC"> so basically any</font>

762
00:28:58,790 --> 00:29:02,600
additions has to be completely public

763
00:29:01,100 --> 00:29:04,969
and go through the same process so that

764
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:07,490
everyone who is a citizen<font color="#E5E5E5"> and a voting</font>

765
00:29:04,970 --> 00:29:09,200
member can come and have a say and then

766
00:29:07,490 --> 00:29:11,330
the fourth<font color="#CCCCCC"> put their the fourth point</font>

767
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:13,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">here the data retention</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and privacy</font>

768
00:29:11,330 --> 00:29:16,520
policy of blood the the citizens privacy

769
00:29:13,820 --> 00:29:18,889
<font color="#E5E5E5">committee and this is where they created</font>

770
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:21,200
the the<font color="#E5E5E5"> privacy committee that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Brian and</font>

771
00:29:18,890 --> 00:29:23,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">I both sat on and had to endure like a</font>

772
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:25,850
grueling year or so<font color="#E5E5E5"> work on which we</font>

773
00:29:23,630 --> 00:29:27,530
created<font color="#E5E5E5"> the policy and as you can see</font>

774
00:29:25,850 --> 00:29:29,389
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> was still pretty concert like still</font>

775
00:29:27,530 --> 00:29:32,120
pretty much a split decision<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the City</font>

776
00:29:29,390 --> 00:29:33,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">Council but we went from like one vote</font>

777
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:36,760
in your favor<font color="#E5E5E5"> 25</font>

778
00:29:33,610 --> 00:29:38,500
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> five is all you need to get past</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

779
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:39,610
because it starts to the policy stuff

780
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:43,390
this is where<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have to hand things over</font>

781
00:29:39,610 --> 00:29:46,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">to Brian and suggest a highlight to have</font>

782
00:29:43,390 --> 00:29:48,220
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> citizens commission that has control</font>

783
00:29:46,540 --> 00:29:49,840
over<font color="#E5E5E5"> writing the use policies that</font>

784
00:29:48,220 --> 00:29:52,450
govern<font color="#E5E5E5"> surveillance equipment to my</font>

785
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:55,750
knowledge has not been done in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> u.s.</font>

786
00:29:52,450 --> 00:29:58,210
at federal state or local<font color="#E5E5E5"> level so it</font>

787
00:29:55,750 --> 00:30:00,549

00:30:06,100 --> 00:30:10,928
dramatically restricted back and

792
00:30:08,740 --> 00:30:14,200
basically given over to the citizens to

793
00:30:10,929 --> 00:30:15,880
write a policy for it<font color="#CCCCCC"> i don't think they</font>

794
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:19,000
thought we would actually do it

<font color="#CCCCCC">i I'd I i think it was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just unknown</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

00:30:20,590 --> 00:30:26,379
consequences which worked out in our

798
00:30:23,559 --> 00:30:27,160
favor because we were an<font color="#CCCCCC"> ad hoc</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">committee</font>

800
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:32,410
it's now a standing committee and we've

801
00:30:29,559 --> 00:30:34,000
got all sorts of policies in the work so

802
00:30:32,410 --> 00:30:37,660
<font color="#CCCCCC">it's greatly expanded from what they</font>

803
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:40,809
initially intended<font color="#E5E5E5"> but so we we try to</font>

804
00:30:37,660 --> 00:30:43,120
look for other policy models to look at

and<font color="#E5E5E5"> there was just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> messin robust nothing</font>

806
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:48,879
that had really hit all the points that

807
00:30:46,419 --> 00:30:50,559
we needed it to some policies<font color="#E5E5E5"> focused on</font>

808
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:53,410
data retention<font color="#E5E5E5"> but they didn't talk</font>

about data sharing<font color="#CCCCCC"> nothing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really had</font>

the questions what was it what is the

836
00:31:56,529 --> 00:32:01,000
mean it actually took us a bunch of

837
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:03,519
pushing and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i finally got to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have a</font>

behind all this stuff<font color="#CCCCCC"> so one thing</font>

841
00:32:08,049 --> 00:32:12,309
that's really interesting<font color="#CCCCCC"> that here is</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">that in our case technology follows</font>

policy<font color="#E5E5E5"> so by their own structures we</font>

844
00:32:15,399 --> 00:32:19,209
create the policy and then they build

the technology to reflect that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">don't trust that all but that's why we</font>

847
00:32:21,309 --> 00:32:24,490
have some of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> account of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the latest</font>

of the structure of the deck itself as<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

850
00:32:26,289 --> 00:32:29,679
said in the very beginning<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have the</font>

851
00:32:28,059 --> 00:32:31,809
two different jurisdictions the<font color="#CCCCCC"> city</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

853
00:32:31,809 --> 00:32:35,590
that by we I mean this policy has

854
00:32:33,700 --> 00:32:38,950
jurisdiction over the city of oakland

855
00:32:35,590 --> 00:32:40,389
but none over the over the port<font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font>

856
00:32:38,950 --> 00:32:42,309
what's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going on this picture on the</font>

857
00:32:40,389 --> 00:32:44,769
right side<font color="#CCCCCC"> i hope you liked my</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ms paint</font>

00:32:44,769 --> 00:32:47,559
<font color="#CCCCCC">what's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> jurisdiction</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> support and they're</font>

860
00:32:46,330 --> 00:32:50,289
the ones that have the<font color="#E5E5E5"> surveillance</font>

861
00:32:47,559 --> 00:32:51,879
<font color="#CCCCCC">camera setup and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> remember that the</font>

862
00:32:50,289 --> 00:32:54,639
<font color="#CCCCCC">Brooks resolution did</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> limit this to the</font>

863
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:57,250
port and these ports are basically

864
00:32:54,639 --> 00:32:59,049
streaming video<font color="#E5E5E5"> to what the best thing</font>

865
00:32:57,250 --> 00:33:01,510
that we can describe<font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> point is a</font>

866
00:32:59,049 --> 00:33:03,279
<font color="#CCCCCC">youtube</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like web browser so the reason</font>

867
00:33:01,510 --> 00:33:05,289
we use that analogy is because if you've

868
00:33:03,279 --> 00:33:06,700
ever used<font color="#E5E5E5"> YouTube you know that you you</font>

869
00:33:05,289 --> 00:33:09,039
load up the web page and you click on

870
00:33:06,700 --> 00:33:10,299
<font color="#E5E5E5">play</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the video starts to play it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

871
00:33:09,039 --> 00:33:11,529
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> stored look I mean there's</font>

872
00:33:10,299 --> 00:33:13,179
buffering and so on but it's not

873
00:33:11,529 --> 00:33:14,980
actually like you're not downloading the

874
00:33:13,179 --> 00:33:17,529
video and then watching it on your own

875
00:33:14,980 --> 00:33:19,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's stored and streamed so it's very</font>

876
00:33:17,529 --> 00:33:21,370
similar to that and then<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think what's</font>

877
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:24,880
really important is also the book market

878
00:33:21,370 --> 00:33:26,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">so if and maybe want to touch into the</font>

879
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:27,279
standards the reasonable suspicion and

880
00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:29,889
so on

881
00:33:27,279 --> 00:33:32,769
<font color="#CCCCCC">you haven't yet so okay so where</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is it a</font>

882
00:33:29,889 --> 00:33:35,439
little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit yes so basically you have a</font>

883
00:33:32,769 --> 00:33:37,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">and also it's important for the DAC that</font>

884
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:39,309
we have control over<font color="#CCCCCC"> no internet access</font>

885
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:40,779
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> that can't let go look at porn or</font>

886
00:33:39,309 --> 00:33:43,090
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> well they're they're watching</font>

887
00:33:40,779 --> 00:33:44,559
everyone else which does happen and

888
00:33:43,090 --> 00:33:47,470
there's other concerns like what if

889
00:33:44,559 --> 00:33:49,149
somebody<font color="#E5E5E5"> hacks</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> breaks into it well it</font>

890
00:33:47,470 --> 00:33:51,460
turns out that the only data<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's</font>

891
00:33:49,149 --> 00:33:53,199
actually being collected is when you see

892
00:33:51,460 --> 00:33:55,090
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> happening and it meets the</font>

893
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:56,830
standards that<font color="#CCCCCC"> Brian will get into</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

894
00:33:55,090 --> 00:33:58,509
make what's called a bookmark basically

895
00:33:56,830 --> 00:34:00,698
you create a

896
00:33:58,509 --> 00:34:03,459
little tab that says what<font color="#E5E5E5"> the the date</font>

897
00:34:00,699 --> 00:34:05,769
time and location was and what<font color="#E5E5E5"> happened</font>

898
00:34:03,459 --> 00:34:07,149
<font color="#E5E5E5">why</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is how they were selling</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

899
00:34:05,769 --> 00:34:10,329
<font color="#E5E5E5">they wanted it you know it was</font>

900
00:34:07,149 --> 00:34:12,668
aggregating all these data inputs and it

901
00:34:10,329 --> 00:34:14,769
wanted they wanted to be able to quickly

902
00:34:12,668 --> 00:34:17,469
retrieve this information and it could

903
00:34:14,768 --> 00:34:19,508
even be emailed or texted out to mobile

904
00:34:17,469 --> 00:34:21,908
<font color="#E5E5E5">units so an officer in the field if you</font>

905
00:34:19,509 --> 00:34:25,179
needed you know a photo of a fleeing

906
00:34:21,909 --> 00:34:26,470
vehicle<font color="#E5E5E5"> they could send that to him and</font>

907
00:34:25,179 --> 00:34:28,450
so that's kind of the the marketing

908
00:34:26,469 --> 00:34:30,518
message they were using<font color="#E5E5E5"> even other</font>

909
00:34:28,449 --> 00:34:32,678
internal emails are like hey we need to

910
00:34:30,518 --> 00:34:33,668
shut down occupy<font color="#CCCCCC"> this you know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

911
00:34:32,679 --> 00:34:35,950
actually creates an issue for

912
00:34:33,668 --> 00:34:37,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">technologists like me because</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm all</font>

913
00:34:35,949 --> 00:34:39,518
about like getting data security but

914
00:34:37,750 --> 00:34:40,989
<font color="#E5E5E5">there's not it because of this there's</font>

915
00:34:39,518 --> 00:34:43,359
not really<font color="#CCCCCC"> collected much except these</font>

916
00:34:40,989 --> 00:34:44,018
bookmarks which is fantastic for civil

917
00:34:43,359 --> 00:34:45,489
liberties

918
00:34:44,018 --> 00:34:47,859
unfortunately<font color="#CCCCCC"> I can't like suggested</font>

919
00:34:45,489 --> 00:34:53,799
cryptography algorithms and such<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> oh</font>

920

925
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:04,960

00:37:30,050 --> 00:37:33,710
think a good half of the debates that we

00:37:32,060 --> 00:37:35,180
had in the the year so that we're doing

991
00:37:33,710 --> 00:37:41,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">this was whether to include the word</font>

993
00:37:41,180 --> 00:37:47,419

996
00:37:50,780 --> 00:37:53,930
you start working on this law

997
00:37:52,100 --> 00:37:55,009
enforcement will definitely try to flip

998
00:37:53,930 --> 00:37:56,629
that on its head

999
00:37:55,010 --> 00:37:59,660
just you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> I encourage you to do it</font>

reporting annual reports every policy

00:38:07,340 --> 00:38:11,840
I've worked on law enforcement gets up

1005
00:38:09,470 --> 00:38:13,259
and say oh this is a clear and proven

1006

<font color="#E5E5E5">how are you demonstrating success you</font>

1009
00:38:20,100 --> 00:38:23,730
that conclusion based on<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so what</font>

1010
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:25,649
we're building on and we'll talk more in

1011
00:38:23,730 --> 00:38:28,620
our workshop afterwards are some really

1012
00:38:25,650 --> 00:38:32,100
robust metrics that they must

1013
00:38:28,620 --> 00:38:35,100
demonstrate in order for continued use

1014
00:38:32,100 --> 00:38:37,620
or expanded use or whatever the the

1015
00:38:35,100 --> 00:38:41,670
question is at that time they've got to

1016
00:38:37,620 --> 00:38:45,000
justify the use of that equipment are

1017
00:38:41,670 --> 00:38:49,320
bigger goal was to change the entire

1018
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:51,240
process itself and<font color="#E5E5E5"> was the DAC we built</font>

1019
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:52,800
it first and then<font color="#CCCCCC"> do the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> privacy policy</font>

1020
00:38:51,240 --> 00:38:54,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">afterwards and what we're really trying</font>

1021
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:56,310
to do is flip that on its head entirely

1022
00:38:54,810 --> 00:38:57,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">we have a public discussion at the</font>

1023
00:38:56,310 --> 00:38:59,220
beginning

1024
00:38:57,210 --> 00:39:01,350
let's let's talk about the impact<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">these items were on the consent calendar</font>

1031
00:39:09,690 --> 00:39:14,670
which if you have consent calendars in

1032
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:17,370
your cities you know that it's just for

1033

1041

there is no policy dictating that some

1045
00:39:43,020 --> 00:39:46,980
change the process<font color="#E5E5E5"> and those bullet</font>

1046
00:39:45,150 --> 00:39:49,800
points<font color="#CCCCCC"> are it right there you have that</font>

1047
00:39:46,980 --> 00:39:51,930
discussion<font color="#E5E5E5"> if the council considers that</font>

1048
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:52,950
the benefits outweigh the concerns you

1049

go forward

just<font color="#E5E5E5"> saying</font>

individual people<font color="#E5E5E5"> and small groups but</font>

1288
00:50:14,780 --> 00:50:18,380
then<font color="#CCCCCC"> you've got a bunch of stakeholders</font>

1289
00:50:16,400 --> 00:50:20,390
involved in other groups<font color="#E5E5E5"> can you say</font>

1290
00:50:18,380 --> 00:50:23,000
anything about organizing in between

1291
00:50:20,390 --> 00:50:26,930
groups that<font color="#CCCCCC"> they were unaffiliated just</font>

1292
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:29,089
kind of random<font color="#E5E5E5"> i think one advantage in</font>

1293
00:50:26,930 --> 00:50:32,270
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> east bay is that it's just small</font>

1294
00:50:29,089 --> 00:50:35,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">certainly compared to New York so people</font>

1295
00:50:32,270 --> 00:50:38,780
tend to know each other<font color="#E5E5E5"> when I first</font>

1296
00:50:35,540 --> 00:50:40,640
showed up in<font color="#CCCCCC"> january 2014 you know we</font>

1297
00:50:38,780 --> 00:50:43,220
have a hundred people at<font color="#CCCCCC"> oakland privacy</font>

1299
00:50:43,220 --> 00:50:49,669

1300
00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:51,440
point<font color="#E5E5E5"> or or you know kind of the</font>

1301
00:50:49,670 --> 00:50:53,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">spearhead</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i guess for all these</font>

1302
00:50:51,440 --> 00:50:57,109

1303
00:50:53,180 --> 00:51:00,259
reach out to<font color="#CCCCCC"> labor or two muslim group</font>

or you know to the teachers union

1305
00:51:00,260 --> 00:51:05,150
because we had a representative from all

1306
00:51:02,750 --> 00:51:07,250
those different groups and they<font color="#E5E5E5"> would go</font>

1307
00:51:05,150 --> 00:51:10,849
in and reach out to them and communicate

1308
00:51:07,250 --> 00:51:13,069
and get those groups<font color="#CCCCCC"> on board</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> site you</font>
