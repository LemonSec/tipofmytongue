there's a technology called touch DNA

43
00:02:05,149 --> 00:02:09,318
of a story from last year<font color="#CCCCCC"> defcon there</font>

44
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:12,709
was a fellow there who had a t-shirt on

00:02:09,318 --> 00:02:16,100
my t-shirt<font color="#E5E5E5"> plugs my book techno creep</font>

46
00:02:12,709 --> 00:02:18,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">his t-shirt said bacteria is the new</font>

47
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:21,950
black<font color="#CCCCCC"> and this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> guy swears that he has</font>

sort of<font color="#E5E5E5"> confirmed that and he</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> his whole</font>

51
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:33,019
theory is that we have which you clean

52
00:02:31,130 --> 00:02:36,410
we used to watch explore<font color="#E5E5E5"> offense opens</font>

53
00:02:33,019 --> 00:02:38,090
up like that and as a result our bodies

54
00:02:36,410 --> 00:02:40,850
are actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> unhealthy</font>

55
00:02:38,090 --> 00:02:43,040
so what does he do<font color="#E5E5E5"> he takes the</font>

56
00:02:40,850 --> 00:02:45,410
occasional sponge bath or something like

57
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:48,019
that but in fact he doesn't really ever

58
00:02:45,410 --> 00:02:49,640
take a bath now

59
00:02:48,019 --> 00:02:51,440
he gave me some stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font>

78
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:50,070
what they decided<font color="#E5E5E5"> the fellow will have</font>

the<font color="#CCCCCC"> bacteria is the new black shirt said</font>

so this talk is very much inspired by

of your you<font color="#E5E5E5"> to finish the story</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i did</font>

120
00:06:25,409 --> 00:06:30,179

do something unethical

126
00:06:37,469 --> 00:06:42,029
so I think the idea is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> although we</font>

all of us in this room have the mindset

129
00:06:44,490 --> 00:06:49,860
of just how it could be misapplied<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

130
00:06:47,729 --> 00:06:52,169
<font color="#CCCCCC">to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to kind</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of put</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> us in the mood for</font>

131
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:54,749
that a buddy of mine recently had the

132
00:06:52,169 --> 00:06:56,938
experience of flying from<font color="#CCCCCC"> Los Angeles to</font>

133
00:06:54,749 --> 00:07:00,779
<font color="#CCCCCC">London</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and there was a huge commotion on</font>

134
00:06:56,939 --> 00:07:02,909
the plane and soon they<font color="#E5E5E5"> display saw</font>

135
00:07:00,779 --> 00:07:05,308
something moving through the plane<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

136
00:07:02,909 --> 00:07:07,169
it turned out to be a bird<font color="#E5E5E5"> had gotten on</font>

00:07:05,309 --> 00:07:09,779
board<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> tell you the whole story</font>

138
00:07:07,169 --> 00:07:11,188
except to say he called his wife and and

139
00:07:09,779 --> 00:07:13,589
they're all these a you know the

140
00:07:11,189 --> 00:07:16,079
apparently it happens often enough that

141
00:07:13,589 --> 00:07:18,389
<font color="#CCCCCC">united airlines</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> has someone on staff to</font>

142
00:07:16,079 --> 00:07:19,709
deal with this they have a zoologist<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

143
00:07:18,389 --> 00:07:21,779
<font color="#E5E5E5">this is all just gave the answer</font>

144
00:07:19,709 --> 00:07:23,699
<font color="#E5E5E5">everyone had to be very quiet</font>

145
00:07:21,779 --> 00:07:27,029
they<font color="#CCCCCC"> had to turn</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> off the lights on the</font>

146
00:07:23,699 --> 00:07:29,399
plane and leave one<font color="#E5E5E5"> lavatory door open</font>

147
00:07:27,029 --> 00:07:31,979
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> sure enough the plane flew the bird</font>

148
00:07:29,399 --> 00:07:33,269
flew into the<font color="#E5E5E5"> laboratory and was trapped</font>

149
00:07:31,979 --> 00:07:34,949
there for the remainder of the flight

150
00:07:33,269 --> 00:07:36,809
from<font color="#E5E5E5"> San Francisco to London</font>

151
00:07:34,949 --> 00:07:38,219
that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> the good part of the story the</font>

152
00:07:36,809 --> 00:07:41,189
<font color="#E5E5E5">really interesting part is this guy</font>

153
00:07:38,219 --> 00:07:46,529
calls his wife and she immediately said

154
00:07:41,189 --> 00:07:48,419
<font color="#E5E5E5">oh</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> how</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the bird is the bird okay and he</font>

155
00:07:46,529 --> 00:07:50,610
said that was very characteristic of

156
00:07:48,419 --> 00:07:52,469
what his wife<font color="#E5E5E5"> would do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> but all this</font>

157
00:07:50,610 --> 00:07:54,509
professional friends immediately said

158
00:07:52,469 --> 00:07:56,550
that proves that there's a serious

159
00:07:54,509 --> 00:07:58,289
security hole in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this system because</font>

160
00:07:56,550 --> 00:08:00,749
after all<font color="#E5E5E5"> if a bird can get on there</font>

161
00:07:58,289 --> 00:08:02,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">what else forget</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and apparently it flew</font>

162
00:08:00,749 --> 00:08:04,620
in as they were loading the food

163
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:06,539
<font color="#E5E5E5">so I suspect most of you in this room</font>

164
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:09,420
would care more about the security holes

165
00:08:06,540 --> 00:08:11,190
in the bird<font color="#CCCCCC"> so the definition</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> biohacking</font>

166
00:08:09,420 --> 00:08:13,290
is this is a slide that I found that

167
00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:15,660
illustrates it<font color="#E5E5E5"> because</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the talks about</font>

168
00:08:13,290 --> 00:08:17,790
being an art and a science<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that's</font>

169
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:20,520
really true<font color="#CCCCCC"> there is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> certainly an</font>

170
00:08:17,790 --> 00:08:24,450
artistic component to it and very<font color="#E5E5E5"> much</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

171
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:26,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">scientific component as well</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be I i</font>

172
00:08:24,450 --> 00:08:29,190
certainly would argue that biohacking is

173
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:31,140
the natural successor to computer

174
00:08:29,190 --> 00:08:32,760
hacking and just give you my own

175

00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:55,200
out and we would do that quite often and

185
00:08:53,670 --> 00:08:57,030
it was four in the morning

186
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:59,850
it could be very entertaining to call

187

the night mayor of<font color="#E5E5E5"> New York City which</font>

we would do but music and talking to him

another phone call

00:09:05,970 --> 00:09:10,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">something like dial-a-prayer or</font>

192
00:09:07,530 --> 00:09:11,280
something like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> so we we discovered</font>

that<font color="#E5E5E5"> there were good things we also did</font>

00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:15,870
experiments<font color="#E5E5E5"> we would find the phone</font>

numbers of<font color="#E5E5E5"> brothers and even identical</font>

little bit of a pool<font color="#E5E5E5"> as to how long it</font>

200
00:09:24,210 --> 00:09:26,910
would take

no screaming<font color="#E5E5E5"> HR</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the why'd you call me</font>

203
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:33,240
what is this for somebody to realize

204
00:09:30,990 --> 00:09:36,270
that hey it's my brother<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm talking</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

207
00:09:38,370 --> 00:09:41,580
where they used to meet was very

208
00:09:39,630 --> 00:09:42,689
interesting<font color="#CCCCCC"> and again i'm telling you</font>

209
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:45,240
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> because many of you probably</font>

210
00:09:42,690 --> 00:09:47,430
weren't in the hacker community back

211
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:49,920
then and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> gues was late sixties early</font>

212
00:09:47,430 --> 00:09:51,030
seventies<font color="#CCCCCC"> they met at a building</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not far</font>

213
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:52,920
from here

214
00:09:51,030 --> 00:09:55,319
<font color="#CCCCCC">they</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> had a food court and the food court</font>

215
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:57,660
had a<font color="#CCCCCC"> role of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 24 telephones and</font>

216
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:59,250
periodically somebody would come up with

217
00:09:57,660 --> 00:10:00,780
something very interesting that you

218
00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:03,150
could possibly do with the telephone

219
00:10:00,780 --> 00:10:06,660
system and<font color="#E5E5E5"> lo and behold somebody would</font>

220
00:10:03,150 --> 00:10:08,280
run off to those phones and verify if

221
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:10,829
you actually could route a call through

222
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:12,720
13 cities and make the phone<font color="#CCCCCC"> over ring</font>

223
00:10:10,830 --> 00:10:14,220
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> phone-hacking was kind of the</font>

224
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:16,120
original and then of course computers

225
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:18,790
came along and computer<font color="#CCCCCC"> how</font>

interested in biology and one of the

234
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:37,479
things<font color="#CCCCCC"> is that computer time like that</font>

235
00:10:34,210 --> 00:10:39,970
was very scarce<font color="#CCCCCC"> we had to line up toward</font>

off and they would get<font color="#E5E5E5"> onto our time</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">showing terminals which we were trying</font>

248

to debug and they would shove their

00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:07,720
programs in that way and they thought

250
00:11:06,130 --> 00:11:09,790
they were getting away with it but we

251
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:11,320
kind of knew who they were and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I should</font>

tell you that one of the most man named

<font color="#CCCCCC">1000 they were wonderful computers</font>

267
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:47,349
because they had<font color="#E5E5E5"> 2k of memory on them</font>

268
00:11:44,290 --> 00:11:49,779
and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> and they had a keyboard with all</font>

269
00:11:47,350 --> 00:11:52,029
the commands for the basic language<font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font>

270
00:11:49,779 --> 00:11:54,070
the point is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> now nobody had to go</font>

271
00:11:52,029 --> 00:11:56,410
out there and hijack<font color="#CCCCCC"> a mainframe</font>

273
00:11:56,410 --> 00:12:00,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">people could actually do things on their</font>

274
00:11:58,839 --> 00:12:02,860
own computers and make them do all kinds

275
00:12:00,910 --> 00:12:06,010
of cool stuff<font color="#CCCCCC"> and once you've got a</font>

276
00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:07,750
modem<font color="#CCCCCC"> it got even more addressing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> was</font>

279
00:12:09,370 --> 00:12:15,580
I can do with my 1200 baud modem and he

280
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:17,439
then proceeded to open the floodgates of

283
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:27,550
so you know as we move from isolated

00:12:56,629 --> 00:13:02,149
<font color="#E5E5E5">namely Time magazine</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> hijacked the word</font>

305
00:13:14,269 --> 00:13:18,499
that name just didn't work that's got

00:13:16,189 --> 00:13:21,290
bad connotations in the south of the

308

the reality is we lost the word<font color="#E5E5E5"> hacker</font>

309
00:13:23,569 --> 00:13:28,459
or<font color="#E5E5E5"> at least we have to share it but this</font>

guy was the perfect embodiment of the

320
00:13:49,430 --> 00:13:54,979
was busy making them all ring if you

321
00:13:52,370 --> 00:13:56,809
take the same mindset and apply it to

groups and things like that

now all you have to do is go to any one

of a number of DIY bio<font color="#E5E5E5"> sites and you can</font>

find out all kinds of useful information

it so now<font color="#CCCCCC"> i have it so it tapers up the</font>

device in ways that the manufacturer

the warranty but that's another story

352
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:06,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">I noticed today by any Soylent</font>

kinds of things now we know he's crazy

380

like a fox

because<font color="#E5E5E5"> he now has a company has a book</font>

and then what you need to put into it is

389
00:16:26,390 --> 00:16:31,790
some butter and some coconut oil<font color="#CCCCCC"> will</font>

interviewed someone who<font color="#E5E5E5"> a has done it to</font>

you make an anonymous well obviously you

729
00:29:57,520 --> 00:30:02,290
pick a name like your cat or dog or

that was the whole point of doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

744
00:30:32,210 --> 00:30:37,700
anonymously so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I did ultimately</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> meditate</font>

745
00:30:35,299 --> 00:30:39,110
and remember the password which<font color="#CCCCCC"> was good</font>

746
00:30:37,700 --> 00:30:41,929
now the reason people are sending their

747
00:30:39,110 --> 00:30:44,360
DNA n is because they want about their

748

750
00:30:47,270 --> 00:30:51,440
and that was a little controversial

so what do we do with our old lab grade

801
00:32:53,190 --> 00:32:58,350

817
00:33:34,679 --> 00:33:41,789
we got reports that he had<font color="#CCCCCC"> it set up in</font>

821
00:33:45,780 --> 00:33:50,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">his neighbor's house because this guy</font>

was trying to build an<font color="#E5E5E5"> x-ray</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> death ray</font>

824
00:33:52,590 --> 00:33:57,000

825
00:33:54,450 --> 00:33:58,890
thing requires 240 volt 3-phase power

826
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:01,409
and he had already ordered the

827

electrician to come in and do it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so</font>

828
00:34:01,409 --> 00:34:06,510
now it is required that if you're going

829
00:34:04,409 --> 00:34:09,629
to buy medical or dental x-ray equipment

<font color="#E5E5E5">you produce a license your doctor of</font>

hundred nine dollars or so and this one

836
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:27,929
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> I picked because there is a</font>

840
00:34:31,290 --> 00:34:36,570
literally<font color="#E5E5E5"> is partially cut off and</font>

841
00:34:33,989 --> 00:34:38,609
<font color="#CCCCCC">essentially says you can i buy this this</font>

842
00:34:36,570 --> 00:34:41,160
this product is subject to<font color="#CCCCCC"> fda</font>

843
00:34:38,610 --> 00:34:42,960
regulation<font color="#CCCCCC"> so you can only buy this we</font>

844
00:34:41,159 --> 00:34:45,359
always sell this to you if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're</font>

845
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:47,850
approved by the<font color="#CCCCCC"> FDA it doesn't really</font>

846
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:51,000
say how<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're going to check</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> as i said</font>

847
00:34:47,850 --> 00:34:52,799
the disclaimers have cut off and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i found</font>

848

<font color="#E5E5E5">disclaimer</font>

850
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:57,600
so if you want to buy any kind of

medical lab equipment on<font color="#E5E5E5"> ebay you're</font>

852
00:34:57,600 --> 00:35:00,960
probably going to get away with doing it

853
00:34:59,070 --> 00:35:04,230
and ain't nobody<font color="#E5E5E5"> gonna ask for your</font>

some of the equipment and they have the

would be necessary to<font color="#E5E5E5"> present it</font>

these clinics which are in it for the

money<font color="#CCCCCC"> will start using these techniques</font>

to make some kind of designer baby<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">no we don't know if that can be done or</font>

1056
00:43:00,690 --> 00:43:05,790
thinking about that so there are many

papers on<font color="#E5E5E5"> minimizing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> off-target effects</font>

the other big thing that they're talking

1072
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:37,819
about is whether we can bring back
