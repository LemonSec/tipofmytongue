00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:21,940
telephone you can actually just pick up

146
00:06:20,530 --> 00:06:24,940
somebody and call them and ask questions

147
00:06:21,940 --> 00:06:27,250
and so maybe it's more efficient because

148
00:06:24,940 --> 00:06:28,780
it enables faster turnaround but maybe

149
00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:30,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's less efficient because people are</font>

00:06:28,780 --> 00:06:35,349
less thoughtful and how they communicate

151
00:06:30,430 --> 00:06:36,790
mobility brought further evolution and

152
00:06:35,350 --> 00:06:39,610
you know when you think about it think

153
00:06:36,790 --> 00:06:40,370
about the ability of being able to

154
00:06:39,610 --> 00:06:43,729
receive

155
00:06:40,370 --> 00:06:46,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">a call anytime in place as opposed to</font>

157
00:06:46,190 --> 00:06:52,219
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually another change</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so when you</font>

158

consider how decisions are made<font color="#E5E5E5"> how</font>

quickly<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're turned around how</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">monitor and we still haven't figured out</font>

173
00:07:23,630 --> 00:07:29,659
as a society how to deal with that and

174

all seven continents one of the things

188
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:12,710
that really is interesting to me is as

189
00:08:10,310 --> 00:08:14,990
telecom comes into a society and as it

190
00:08:12,710 --> 00:08:17,448
gets adopted and used<font color="#CCCCCC"> how does that</font>

change how people interact<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

leave a small deposit with the person

00:09:23,150 --> 00:09:26,900
your call<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's timed and then when you</font>

219
00:09:24,860 --> 00:09:29,330
finish you can pay the the guy who's

220
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:31,010
sitting in the booth working<font color="#E5E5E5"> and this is</font>

221
00:09:29,330 --> 00:09:32,480
the way that a lot of people communicate

222
00:09:31,010 --> 00:09:35,000
when they need to make a phone call they

223
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:36,260
actually have to go somewhere<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's not</font>

224
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:39,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">in their house they don't have a mobile</font>

225
00:09:36,260 --> 00:09:40,340
phone and they pay somebody just like if

226
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:43,070
you were taking a letter to the post

227
00:09:40,340 --> 00:09:45,740
office and in fact this particular one I

228
00:09:43,070 --> 00:09:47,810
took<font color="#E5E5E5"> across the street from the pic this</font>

229
00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:50,240
particular picture i took across the

street from<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> post office in in a remote</font>

community<font color="#CCCCCC"> uh additionally you'll see</font>

232
00:09:57,230 --> 00:10:01,520
cases where people who don't have mobile

233
00:09:59,990 --> 00:10:03,020
phones and you know the<font color="#E5E5E5"> number</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

234
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:05,870
shrinking<font color="#E5E5E5"> but the technology is still</font>

235
00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:07,699
out there who want the ability to

236
00:10:05,870 --> 00:10:10,370
communicate with people that do and so

237
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:13,040
one innovation that we saw that was you

238
00:10:10,370 --> 00:10:16,220
know kind of interesting in<font color="#CCCCCC"> Thailand is</font>

239
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:18,199
the addition of SMS capability to pay

240
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:20,570
phones and you also<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> only in</font>

actually gets<font color="#CCCCCC"> use their</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you know there's</font>

243
00:10:22,850 --> 00:10:27,080
if you use a<font color="#CCCCCC"> British Telecom</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> payphone</font>

244
00:10:24,830 --> 00:10:29,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have the ability to send SMS from it</font>

245
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:31,820

246
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:33,710
get<font color="#E5E5E5"> used and the reason why they do is</font>

247
00:10:31,820 --> 00:10:35,240
because you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> set</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the text for a very</font>

248
00:10:33,710 --> 00:10:37,880
cheap price and if you're out of mobile

249
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:41,480
credit<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can do it from one of these</font>

250
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:44,480
phones very easily<font color="#E5E5E5"> but you probably</font>

251
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:46,640
noticed in both of those communications

252
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:47,690
scenarios it's an asynchronous form of

253
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:49,880
communication

254
00:10:47,690 --> 00:10:51,740
so you know if you have access to a

255
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:53,780
telephone<font color="#CCCCCC"> but you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't have the ability</font>

256
00:10:51,740 --> 00:10:55,670
to receive calls if you will only have

257
00:10:53,780 --> 00:10:57,829
the ability to send messages

258
00:10:55,670 --> 00:11:00,829
you're really not a whole lot better off

259
00:10:57,830 --> 00:11:04,760
from an economic standpoint<font color="#CCCCCC"> then you</font>

260
00:11:00,830 --> 00:11:06,930
would be if you had a telegraph<font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

it's more private

297
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:39,390
they're not seen going into a counselor

accomplish things like ordering on

you know you just get used to in<font color="#CCCCCC"> China</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">going to the phone company's office</font>

mean we've been doing that online for a

00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:08,969
long time but people have gotten in the

360

habit of doing it just<font color="#E5E5E5"> keeps showing up</font>

361
00:15:08,970 --> 00:15:12,690
at offices and so it's been impossible

362
00:15:10,769 --> 00:15:14,550
for<font color="#CCCCCC"> china telecom to close down their</font>

offices and move everybody to online

platforms<font color="#CCCCCC"> so this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is a way that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they</font>

365
00:15:16,709 --> 00:15:20,069
<font color="#CCCCCC">have innovated around how people</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">mm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's a kiosk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> anytime you see a kiosk</font>

00:15:23,340 --> 00:15:26,460
if you really think about it you could

369
00:15:24,690 --> 00:15:29,400
probably do the same thing with the with

370
00:15:26,460 --> 00:15:31,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">the mobile app or</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> web page but actually</font>

371
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:33,329
you find kiosks all over<font color="#CCCCCC"> China for all</font>

372
00:15:31,530 --> 00:15:35,730
sorts of things just because people are

373
00:15:33,330 --> 00:15:37,890
used to actually physically going places

374
00:15:35,730 --> 00:15:41,280
to do things

375
00:15:37,890 --> 00:15:46,260
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a ninja telephone but that's not</font>

376
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:48,930
the focus of<font color="#E5E5E5"> of this uh Germany is a</font>

377
00:15:46,260 --> 00:15:53,160
country that many of us think of being

378
00:15:48,930 --> 00:15:54,930
very open and very<font color="#CCCCCC"> freewheeling</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

379

380
00:15:54,930 --> 00:16:00,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">but actually in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Germany you have to tell</font>

the police when you move and you're not

allowed to use the internet anonymously

383
00:16:02,010 --> 00:16:08,670
even if you use a Wi-Fi access point

384
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:10,380
that's public<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have to provide a</font>

385
00:16:08,670 --> 00:16:12,479
telephone number so you can be tracked

386

and telephones<font color="#CCCCCC"> aren't available</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">honestly and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Germany either so this is a</font>

388
00:16:14,670 --> 00:16:19,290
pretty effective way of being able to

389
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:23,130
spy on what everybody is doing both

390
00:16:19,290 --> 00:16:26,370
online and offline<font color="#E5E5E5"> so why do I include</font>

391
00:16:23,130 --> 00:16:28,650
this because actually surveillance is a

392
00:16:26,370 --> 00:16:30,690
part of how people interact with

393
00:16:28,650 --> 00:16:32,730
communication<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know we all know that</font>

394
00:16:30,690 --> 00:16:34,620
surveillance is a factor and it's a

395
00:16:32,730 --> 00:16:35,190
question of how in your face it is or

396
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:37,530
isn't

00:17:29,550 --> 00:17:33,750
profitable businesses in small towns

00:17:31,620 --> 00:17:36,149
often that only<font color="#E5E5E5"> exists</font>

419
00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:40,650
as we have the ability to communicate in

00:17:36,150 --> 00:17:44,130
these new ways<font color="#CCCCCC"> in fact even in Somalia</font>

427
00:17:56,760 --> 00:18:00,690
unfortunate thing that's happening there

428
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:02,460
but uh you know they're actually

429
00:18:00,690 --> 00:18:03,750
cheering for instability sometimes

430
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:06,510
because they make more money when that

431
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:08,670
happens<font color="#E5E5E5"> I young people additionally are</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">banned from socializing and so this is</font>

433
00:18:08,670 --> 00:18:13,410
one of the things that they do is use

434
00:18:11,730 --> 00:18:14,910
SMS for that young people are going to

435
00:18:13,410 --> 00:18:17,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">socialize anyway</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> would</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> whatever the</font>

government says<font color="#E5E5E5"> and telecom is allowing</font>

437
00:18:17,970 --> 00:18:22,830
that not only to happen which i think is

438
00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:24,270
a really exciting thing you know social

439
00:18:22,830 --> 00:18:27,570
control could have been<font color="#CCCCCC"> affected</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> before</font>

441
00:18:27,570 --> 00:18:33,780
also it's also an interesting driver of

442
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:38,310
being able to have<font color="#E5E5E5"> telecom in the first</font>

443

place in a very war-torn area so<font color="#E5E5E5"> i don't</font>

444
00:18:38,310 --> 00:18:42,929
know if you've seen grinder or cuddly

<font color="#CCCCCC">but even the way that we meet each other</font>

447
00:18:45,210 --> 00:18:50,250
has changed significantly with the

448
00:18:47,340 --> 00:18:52,080
advent of new ways to communicate<font color="#E5E5E5"> we can</font>

449
00:18:50,250 --> 00:18:54,600
actually meet somebody in this very

location if we want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> within you know</font>

451
00:18:54,600 --> 00:19:02,189
within a mile of hair that is one of the

452
00:18:58,740 --> 00:19:04,230
most profound changes in how we interact

453
00:19:02,190 --> 00:19:07,620
as humans<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is actually</font>

happened in the past century<font color="#E5E5E5"> where else</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">on demand can you meet somebody who has</font>

456
00:19:10,290 --> 00:19:17,340
almost exactly the same interests as you

<font color="#E5E5E5">you can download concierge</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> shops there</font>

to go<font color="#E5E5E5"> through all of them but the</font>

00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:26,639
thought was kind of interesting<font color="#CCCCCC"> i don't</font>

462
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:29,370
know what makes it official exactly but

463
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:33,360
you can show up in a country where

464
00:19:29,370 --> 00:19:34,560
you've never been as i did in<font color="#CCCCCC"> india and</font>

465
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:37,169
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually get a whole bunch of</font>

466
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:39,480
information that used to have to find

467
00:19:37,170 --> 00:19:42,840
out from locals who<font color="#CCCCCC"> had their own</font>

468
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:45,450
agendas<font color="#CCCCCC"> what to do you have access to</font>

469
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:46,409
being able to land in a strange city and

470
00:19:45,450 --> 00:19:48,660
navigate on

471
00:19:46,410 --> 00:19:50,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">apps with a pretty high degree of</font>

472
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:53,160
reliability and so when you consider the

473
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:55,560
impact that this has on human behavior

474
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:57,570
you can you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> I can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> literally</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> land in</font>

475
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:59,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">a country where I've never been feed</font>

476
00:19:57,570 --> 00:20:02,460
myself and find my way around and never

477
00:19:59,730 --> 00:20:06,690
even really interact with the locals in

478
00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:08,670
any way other than transactional you

479
00:20:06,690 --> 00:20:11,610
know even in my home state of Washington

480
00:20:08,670 --> 00:20:13,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">I you can get a lot of information about</font>

481
00:20:11,610 --> 00:20:14,550
our new legal marijuana there's an app

482
00:20:13,830 --> 00:20:16,980
for that

483
00:20:14,550 --> 00:20:19,020
it's called briefly<font color="#E5E5E5"> and there are</font>

484
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:21,480
marijuana like find marijuana apps on

485
00:20:19,020 --> 00:20:23,610
what kind of errand marijuana and so you

486
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:25,650
know why do I bring this up<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> because</font>

487
00:20:23,610 --> 00:20:28,110
for<font color="#CCCCCC"> any see</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you know we're getting to</font>

488
00:20:25,650 --> 00:20:31,170
the point where for anything that you

489
00:20:28,110 --> 00:20:33,810
look at in<font color="#E5E5E5"> in human society there is</font>

490
00:20:31,170 --> 00:20:35,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">literally a way that you can use telecom</font>

491
00:20:33,810 --> 00:20:37,169
to enable scenarios around it and this

492
00:20:35,790 --> 00:20:39,540
is actually something that's never

493
00:20:37,170 --> 00:20:42,540
existed before in human history right<font color="#CCCCCC"> if</font>

494
00:20:39,540 --> 00:20:44,879
you think about it<font color="#CCCCCC"> uh you know if you</font>

495
00:20:42,540 --> 00:20:47,430
wanted pot 10 years ago you you didn't

496
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:49,080
pick up<font color="#CCCCCC"> an appt I you you needed to get</font>

497
00:20:47,430 --> 00:20:50,430
introduced to a drug dealer and you know

498
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:54,659
it's it's a very different world today

499
00:20:50,430 --> 00:20:56,340
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> of pointing at some of the</font>

500
00:20:54,660 --> 00:20:58,380
infrastructure that enables<font color="#E5E5E5"> the stuff</font>

501
00:20:56,340 --> 00:20:59,639
this is a you know a<font color="#CCCCCC"> payphone</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that's</font>

502
00:20:58,380 --> 00:21:01,380
probably not going to be there for much

503
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:04,860
longer and is missing a handle in the

504
00:21:01,380 --> 00:21:06,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">Netherlands but actually you know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i just</font>

505
00:21:04,860 --> 00:21:08,669
spoke to somebody from<font color="#CCCCCC"> Ecuador</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and this</font>

506
00:21:06,660 --> 00:21:11,220
is changing but until fairly recently

507
00:21:08,670 --> 00:21:12,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> pay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> phones actually got used in</font>

00:21:11,220 --> 00:21:15,030
<font color="#CCCCCC">Ecuador</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> because they</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have different</font>

509
00:21:12,540 --> 00:21:16,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">rates of building between different</font>

510
00:21:15,030 --> 00:21:18,570
networks and so it would drive some

511
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:20,730
interesting behavior where people ran

512
00:21:18,570 --> 00:21:21,990
out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of mobile credit or if they wanted</font>

513
00:21:20,730 --> 00:21:24,840
to call somebody on a different network

514
00:21:21,990 --> 00:21:27,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">they would have an incentive to use of a</font>

515
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:28,889
<font color="#E5E5E5">payphone of the other network in order</font>

516
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:30,480
to keep from being built very high rates

517
00:21:28,890 --> 00:21:31,890
and there are some places in the world

518
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:33,750
where this is still the case<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's no</font>

519
00:21:31,890 --> 00:21:37,200
longer true<font color="#CCCCCC"> in Ecuador so this is a</font>

520
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:40,440
historical photo<font color="#E5E5E5"> but it is an</font>

521
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:42,180
interesting way that humans will change

522
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:43,980
their behavior in order to communicate

523
00:21:42,180 --> 00:21:46,920
you know if you really think about it

524
00:21:43,980 --> 00:21:49,230
until<font color="#E5E5E5"> recently in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Ecuador you had to</font>

525
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:50,880
know all of the rates for calling

526
00:21:49,230 --> 00:21:52,620
different networks what phone numbers

527
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:55,950
matched what networks and you would just

528
00:21:52,620 --> 00:21:57,870
drive somewhere and make a call in order

529
00:21:55,950 --> 00:21:59,789
to avoid being soaked on your<font color="#E5E5E5"> goal</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

530
00:21:57,870 --> 00:22:02,309
<font color="#CCCCCC">you know you can actually do a lot</font>

531
00:21:59,789 --> 00:22:04,350
of social engineering<font color="#E5E5E5"> through</font>

00:22:02,309 --> 00:22:06,299
telecommunications<font color="#CCCCCC"> billing at this point</font>

533
00:22:04,350 --> 00:22:08,609
which is also a fairly interesting

534
00:22:06,299 --> 00:22:10,499
recent development

535
00:22:08,609 --> 00:22:11,879
this is a place that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I found through</font>

536
00:22:10,499 --> 00:22:13,619
<font color="#E5E5E5">telecom that I would never found</font>

00:22:11,879 --> 00:22:16,498
otherwise<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Thailand and I will</font>

538
00:22:13,619 --> 00:22:18,389
never tell where it is but<font color="#E5E5E5"> uh you know</font>

539
00:22:16,499 --> 00:22:20,429
the the point that I'm making here is

540
00:22:18,389 --> 00:22:22,678
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sitting on this beach with</font>

541
00:22:20,429 --> 00:22:24,029
very fast internet in one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the most</font>

542
00:22:22,679 --> 00:22:25,679
remote places you can find in the

00:22:24,029 --> 00:22:29,519
country which<font color="#E5E5E5"> i found on the internet</font>

544
00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:32,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">and if it had been 30 years ago</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I would</font>

545
00:22:29,519 --> 00:22:34,470
never<font color="#E5E5E5"> found this place at all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so the</font>

00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:36,599
<font color="#CCCCCC">point that I that I want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to be sure to</font>

547
00:22:34,470 --> 00:22:37,889
drive home is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is very much a</font>

00:22:36,599 --> 00:22:41,039
double-edged sword

549
00:22:37,889 --> 00:22:45,149
we've created a tremendous number of

550
00:22:41,039 --> 00:22:47,220
ways to communicate that unlock<font color="#E5E5E5"> massive</font>

551
00:22:45,149 --> 00:22:50,248
scenarios that didn't exist before but

00:22:47,220 --> 00:22:53,009
at the same time<font color="#E5E5E5"> we've cut back the</font>

00:22:50,249 --> 00:22:55,139
ability to interact with each other at a

more local level and<font color="#E5E5E5"> a more human level</font>

00:28:53,110 --> 00:28:56,919
resources at all and build a business

695
00:28:54,970 --> 00:29:00,220
around it you know where else would a

696
00:28:56,920 --> 00:29:02,020
guy in<font color="#CCCCCC"> Vietnam</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with a couple years of</font>

697
00:29:00,220 --> 00:29:04,780
development experience be able to have

698
00:29:02,020 --> 00:29:07,300
such a blockbuster is flat flappy bird

699
00:29:04,780 --> 00:29:13,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">this is something that would never have</font>

700
00:29:07,300 --> 00:29:16,480
happened before<font color="#E5E5E5"> the technologies that we</font>

701
00:29:13,210 --> 00:29:18,580
all rely on today<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and you know there's</font>

702
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:20,710
actually there's an upside now you may

703
00:29:18,580 --> 00:29:22,030
say arch<font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> tea</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> profit</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you're crazy</font>

704
00:29:20,710 --> 00:29:24,309
there's no more transparency in

705
00:29:22,030 --> 00:29:25,960
government but the reality is there is

706
00:29:24,309 --> 00:29:29,139
more transparency in government than

707
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:31,240
ever before<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and the reason for that is</font>

708
00:29:29,140 --> 00:29:32,470
because it's not just<font color="#E5E5E5"> one of government</font>

709
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:35,290
officially gives you

710
00:29:32,470 --> 00:29:37,000
it's what gets leaked and the amount of

711
00:29:35,290 --> 00:29:39,850
information coming out of the government

712
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:43,840
today<font color="#CCCCCC"> the amount of access that you have</font>

713
00:29:39,850 --> 00:29:46,178
<font color="#E5E5E5">the ability of people to see what their</font>

714
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:48,580
government is doing and read the exact

715
00:29:46,179 --> 00:29:51,280
policy decisions behind it is much more

716
00:29:48,580 --> 00:29:54,070
than we've ever had and that enables if

717
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:56,230
if we can we have a we have a more

718
00:29:54,070 --> 00:29:58,480
informed democracy<font color="#E5E5E5"> if we just choose to</font>

719
00:29:56,230 --> 00:30:01,780
be more informed<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the current election</font>

720
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:04,210
season<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're not choosing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to but the</font>

721
00:30:01,780 --> 00:30:08,170
structure is there to do so

722
00:30:04,210 --> 00:30:10,030
so the question<font color="#CCCCCC"> I want to ask and you</font>

723
00:30:08,170 --> 00:30:11,530
know this is a visit this is a little

724
00:30:10,030 --> 00:30:13,030
bit different than most of the talks

725
00:30:11,530 --> 00:30:14,559
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I give because I'll</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> outline a whole</font>

726

bunch of problems and solutions and

727
00:30:14,559 --> 00:30:19,660
really I don't have any solution for how

728
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:21,879
do we change the fact that being<font color="#CCCCCC"> a human</font>

00:30:19,660 --> 00:30:25,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">is different with all these tools that</font>

732
00:30:28,090 --> 00:30:31,809
that you can think of for yourself and

<font color="#E5E5E5">where these technologies fit into your</font>

735
00:30:33,970 --> 00:30:39,640
communities really are real places they

<font color="#E5E5E5">there's a massive amount of interaction</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">they part of the same thing you know</font>

757
00:31:28,970 --> 00:31:32,779
there's actually a ton of technologies

758
00:31:30,590 --> 00:31:34,610
that we've developed where<font color="#E5E5E5"> were blurring</font>

759
00:31:32,779 --> 00:31:37,700
the lines particularly with augmented

interacting with online and offline and

763
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:50,480
I think we haven't really figured out as

a community<font color="#CCCCCC"> how to deal with that so the</font>

practically all<font color="#CCCCCC"> of them happened with</font>

phones at one point and we came to grips

with it as a society phones went through

you know there's there's no ability to

granted but doing it in a different way

985
00:41:35,110 --> 00:41:40,030
and so one thing that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think is really</font>

986
00:41:37,870 --> 00:41:43,569
important<font color="#E5E5E5"> and this is the point</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i really</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">needs to be synchronous and it needs to</font>

989
00:41:46,360 --> 00:41:50,530
actually unlock scenarios that are

relevant and useful to whom<font color="#E5E5E5"> were locking</font>

00:41:50,530 --> 00:41:55,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">unlocking them for you know</font>

992
00:41:53,620 --> 00:41:57,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">can the internet be useful to somebody</font>

who doesn't know how to read for example

<font color="#E5E5E5">actually</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it can because if you can speak</font>

998
00:42:05,350 --> 00:42:09,759
example<font color="#CCCCCC"> so there's a lot of scenarios</font>

999
00:42:07,810 --> 00:42:11,830
that are really amazing and

a lot of surveillance scenarios that can

1003
00:42:16,780 --> 00:42:20,860
all can be unlocked as well and we need

1004
00:42:18,910 --> 00:42:24,250
to consider the impact of the services

1005
00:42:20,860 --> 00:42:27,820
were building their next question

1006
00:42:24,250 --> 00:42:29,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">thanks fantastic talk and so can you</font>

1007
00:42:27,820 --> 00:42:33,640
talk a little bit about<font color="#E5E5E5"> telephone</font>

1009
00:42:33,640 --> 00:42:37,330
any other places that are like<font color="#E5E5E5"> as remote</font>

1010
00:42:35,740 --> 00:42:38,169
that maybe you've been<font color="#E5E5E5"> to and have it</font>

1011
00:42:37,330 --> 00:42:40,690
how it works there

1012
00:42:38,170 --> 00:42:43,600
great well let's go north and south<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

1013
00:42:40,690 --> 00:42:46,720
can talk about<font color="#CCCCCC"> Barrow and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Prudhoe Bay</font>

1014
00:42:43,600 --> 00:42:49,509
<font color="#E5E5E5">Alaska and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I can also talk about an</font>

1015
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:51,609
<font color="#E5E5E5">archive been both places</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so if you are</font>

1016
00:42:49,510 --> 00:42:54,100
in barrel<font color="#CCCCCC"> askah it looks very much like</font>

1017
00:42:51,610 --> 00:42:56,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">palau there's a giant satellite dish</font>

1018
00:42:54,100 --> 00:43:00,700
that's what<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're talking over there is</font>

1019
00:42:56,350 --> 00:43:01,990
very slow and<font color="#E5E5E5"> laggy connectivity</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> when</font>

1020
00:43:00,700 --> 00:43:03,700
there's a storm it doesn't always work

1021
00:43:01,990 --> 00:43:05,859
because satellites up there are you

1022
00:43:03,700 --> 00:43:07,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">loaded the horizon and so you know you</font>

1023
00:43:05,860 --> 00:43:08,890
the internet just cuts out there

1024
00:43:07,210 --> 00:43:11,260
sometimes

1025
00:43:08,890 --> 00:43:13,180
so what does that mean for the economic

1026
00:43:11,260 --> 00:43:16,540
opportunities of people in<font color="#CCCCCC"> Barrow</font>

1027
00:43:13,180 --> 00:43:19,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually not a whole lot because the</font>

1028
00:43:16,540 --> 00:43:21,430
<font color="#CCCCCC">Barrow is the center of government and</font>

1029
00:43:19,270 --> 00:43:24,820
that's most of the economy there there's

1030
00:43:21,430 --> 00:43:27,190
also a<font color="#CCCCCC"> spot</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> college called</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> le saga</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

1031
00:43:24,820 --> 00:43:30,430
college<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you know it's kind of the</font>

1032
00:43:27,190 --> 00:43:32,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">community college for the North Slope</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font>

1033
00:43:30,430 --> 00:43:34,140
you know it's based on the economy is

1034
00:43:32,560 --> 00:43:38,430
based on education

1035
00:43:34,140 --> 00:43:41,578
<font color="#E5E5E5">and government uh and some wailing so</font>

1036
00:43:38,430 --> 00:43:43,319
you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> what if you're if you're</font>

1037
00:43:41,579 --> 00:43:45,390
planning a whaling expedition you just

1038
00:43:43,319 --> 00:43:48,210
go talk to people next door so you don't

1039
00:43:45,390 --> 00:43:50,279
really need the internet for that up

1040
00:43:48,210 --> 00:43:52,200
Prudhoe Bay<font color="#CCCCCC"> introduce a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> different</font>

1041
00:43:50,279 --> 00:43:53,940
scenario right<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's where you actually</font>

1042
00:43:52,200 --> 00:43:55,890
do have a pretty strong need for

1043
00:43:53,940 --> 00:43:57,630
connectivity because<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's the center</font>

1044
00:43:55,890 --> 00:44:00,299
of the Arctic slope<font color="#CCCCCC"> drilling so there's</font>

1045
00:43:57,630 --> 00:44:02,400
tons of oil derricks<font color="#CCCCCC"> rigs you know</font>

1046
00:44:00,299 --> 00:44:04,829
there's a massive oil industry there and

1047
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:07,200
the oil industry actually ran<font color="#CCCCCC"> fiber up</font>

the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Dalton highway which is locally</font>

00:44:23,279 --> 00:44:28,170
<font color="#CCCCCC">challenges that they face is there's a</font>

1056
00:44:25,170 --> 00:44:31,019
condition called frost heaves where the

1057
00:44:28,170 --> 00:44:34,829
permafrost thaws in the summer and it

1058
00:44:31,019 --> 00:44:37,680
refreezes<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the fall and that causes it</font>

1059
00:44:34,829 --> 00:44:39,569
that causes the permafrost<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go up and</font>

1060
00:44:37,680 --> 00:44:42,269
you know they made the bad decision to

1061
00:44:39,569 --> 00:44:45,299
bury the<font color="#CCCCCC"> fiber-optic</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> cable so it breaks</font>

1062
00:44:42,269 --> 00:44:47,129
basically every year and they don't have

00:44:45,299 --> 00:44:48,390
connectivity for<font color="#CCCCCC"> a while until they</font>

1064
00:44:47,130 --> 00:44:51,299
build it because there's only one fiber

there<font color="#CCCCCC"> i went</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to Antarctica with the</font>

is therefore less expensive for the

00:49:34,760 --> 00:49:39,050
reason why phone companies do it is

1175
00:49:36,710 --> 00:49:41,060
because people won't pay for quality

1176
00:49:39,050 --> 00:49:42,980
you're getting unlimited<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know like</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">I and one of the most exciting ways to</font>

1188
00:50:07,310 --> 00:50:09,980
do that is through technology called

<font color="#CCCCCC">step</font>

1190

<font color="#CCCCCC">skype is also you know its proprietary</font>

1192
00:50:14,390 --> 00:50:18,650
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> the quality of skype calls is</font>

1193
00:50:16,670 --> 00:50:19,970
generally very good as well<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> what I</font>

1195
00:50:19,970 --> 00:50:25,790
going to be just doing less traditional

1196
00:50:22,280 --> 00:50:28,070
phone calling and more skyping or more

1197
00:50:25,790 --> 00:50:29,720
using alternative applications like

1198
00:50:28,070 --> 00:50:31,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">facebook Messenger is another great</font>

1199
00:50:29,720 --> 00:50:34,250
example they have phenomenal audio

that one then<font color="#E5E5E5"> how long before you think</font>

1206
00:50:46,700 --> 00:50:51,919
the audio quality for a random cell

1207
00:50:49,430 --> 00:50:53,660
phone call or skype<font color="#CCCCCC"> will be at</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the level</font>

we had with<font color="#CCCCCC"> land lines</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> because it seems</font>

call the audio quality to most people

1214
00:51:05,510 --> 00:51:14,180
sounds better than a landline

<font color="#E5E5E5">I he might using the mic we are</font>

recording the session so if you want to

1217

ask a question<font color="#E5E5E5"> its best on the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> bike</font>

have you discussed the deteriorating

copper infrastructure and how bad that

1221
00:51:25,760 --> 00:51:28,520
is

1222
00:51:26,630 --> 00:51:30,200
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know I that wasn't the focus of this</font>

1223
00:51:28,520 --> 00:51:35,720

00:51:30,200 --> 00:51:38,359
question most copper in place in the

00:51:35,720 --> 00:51:40,069
<font color="#CCCCCC">u.s. so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you know keep in mind many parts</font>

1226
00:51:38,359 --> 00:51:42,500
of the world have just bypass landlines

1227
00:51:40,070 --> 00:51:45,109
entirely<font color="#CCCCCC"> they never built them</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> because</font>

1228
00:51:42,500 --> 00:51:46,970
you can actually deliver services to

1229
00:51:45,109 --> 00:51:49,670
more people much cheaper by using

1230

00:51:49,670 --> 00:51:54,050
an interesting place where we have both

<font color="#CCCCCC">and you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know if you look at Europe</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they</font>

have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of old copper as well so for</font>

1234
00:51:57,859 --> 00:52:06,080
us to be able to bring in<font color="#E5E5E5"> high-speed</font>

00:52:06,080 --> 00:52:11,779
<font color="#CCCCCC">there are a number of ways to do that i</font>

1237
00:52:08,869 --> 00:52:14,750
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> see phone companies ever investing</font>

00:52:11,780 --> 00:52:16,550
<font color="#CCCCCC">anymore than the bare minimum in keeping</font>

00:52:14,750 --> 00:52:18,859
up the old copper that they've<font color="#E5E5E5"> laid</font>

before<font color="#CCCCCC"> what we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are seeing is an</font>

1241
00:52:18,859 --> 00:52:22,720
increasing prevalence of<font color="#E5E5E5"> fiber to the</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">hasta fiber comes down and as the copper</font>

1244
00:52:26,770 --> 00:52:30,820
infrastructure further deteriorate so I

1245
00:52:28,960 --> 00:52:32,800
expect that we'll<font color="#CCCCCC"> see phone companies</font>

1246
00:52:30,820 --> 00:52:37,690
where they see an<font color="#CCCCCC"> Economic Opportunity</font>

1247
00:52:32,800 --> 00:52:39,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">bringing in fiber but that leaves a big</font>

00:52:37,690 --> 00:52:41,380
chunk of<font color="#CCCCCC"> Americans</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> out and this is</font>

1249
00:52:39,580 --> 00:52:44,740
actually a really important point and

1250
00:52:41,380 --> 00:52:48,190
maybe a subject for a future column<font color="#E5E5E5"> many</font>

1256
00:52:59,770 --> 00:53:04,359
delivered over phone lines and so what

1257
00:53:02,380 --> 00:53:06,280
that's meant is that phone companies can

1258
00:53:04,359 --> 00:53:08,980
basically do whatever the heck they<font color="#CCCCCC"> want</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">and sold whoever they want or not salt</font>

whoever they want

00:53:10,150 --> 00:53:16,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">if you are rich and making six figures</font>

we talk about digital<font color="#CCCCCC"> device inside the</font>

in developing countries could also be

1275
00:53:46,630 --> 00:53:50,920
delivered here there's really nothing

1276
00:53:48,339 --> 00:53:53,109
stopping wireless technology from being

1277
00:53:50,920 --> 00:53:56,349
deployed in a bigger way<font color="#CCCCCC"> and so what I</font>

1278
00:53:53,109 --> 00:53:59,589
think's going to happen is we may see

1279
00:53:56,349 --> 00:54:02,859
some government policy<font color="#E5E5E5"> put into place to</font>

1280
00:53:59,589 --> 00:54:05,529
ensure that everyone has a fair shot at

1281
00:54:02,859 --> 00:54:07,330
broadband<font color="#E5E5E5"> but the way that's delivered</font>

1282
00:54:05,530 --> 00:54:11,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">may be different in the future than it</font>

1283
00:54:07,330 --> 00:54:13,779
is today

1284
00:54:11,440 --> 00:54:16,300
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> course a lot of that i will point out</font>

00:54:13,780 --> 00:54:17,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">depends</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on the results of the next</font>

00:54:17,690 --> 00:54:23,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">and with that I think we're out of time</font>

00:54:21,950 --> 00:54:30,549
thanks so much for coming
