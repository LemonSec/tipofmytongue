1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">thanks yeah i'm really excited</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font>

2
00:00:08,910 --> 00:00:13,799
here<font color="#CCCCCC"> at hope</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to give a talk</font>

3
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:15,660
<font color="#CCCCCC">it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a huge honor for me</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so my name is</font>

4
00:00:13,799 --> 00:00:18,359
<font color="#CCCCCC">Paul kornfeld</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm a software</font>

5
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:22,109
engineer<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> interested in peer-to-peer</font>

6
00:00:18,359 --> 00:00:24,660
systems especially<font color="#CCCCCC"> Bitcoin</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so this talk</font>

7
00:00:22,109 --> 00:00:27,539
is going to be about public digital

8
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:29,609
library that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> designed and built</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font>

9
00:00:27,539 --> 00:00:32,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">designed to be resistant to censorship</font>

10
00:00:29,609 --> 00:00:36,809
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I actually have a working prototype</font>

11
00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:39,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">this is my first public presentation of</font>

12
00:00:36,809 --> 00:00:42,839
the working code so<font color="#E5E5E5"> i hope you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> liked it</font>

13
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:44,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">and so for you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you're probably going to</font>

14
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:48,329
get the most out of this<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you're</font>

15
00:00:44,730 --> 00:00:52,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">interested in software but you shouldn't</font>

16
00:00:48,329 --> 00:00:53,550
need<font color="#E5E5E5"> too much background and I'm</font>

17
00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:56,340
intentionally<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to move really fast</font>

18
00:00:53,550 --> 00:01:00,328
here and you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'd rather get you</font>

19
00:00:56,340 --> 00:01:01,920
excited about this<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you know maybe</font>

20
00:01:00,329 --> 00:01:04,739
you won't understand a hundred percent

21
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:06,330
but<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'd like you to leave the talk with</font>

22
00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:08,700
some you know some questions about

23
00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:14,670
what's going on

24
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:18,420
so a<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i just--that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> from the</font>

25
00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:22,049
internet but<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah sure</font>

26
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:24,750
so what do<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean when</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I say digital</font>

27
00:01:22,049 --> 00:01:28,259
library for my personal definition

28
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:31,829
<font color="#E5E5E5">really</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> there's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's a searchable</font>

29
00:01:28,259 --> 00:01:34,500
repository of files and there's two

30
00:01:31,829 --> 00:01:37,860
things that you should be able to do one

31
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:40,890
thing is it<font color="#CCCCCC"> it allows a user to find</font>

32
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:43,439
files and the second thing is it allows

33
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:47,640
a user to retrieve files<font color="#CCCCCC"> pretty</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> simple</font>

34
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:50,548
<font color="#E5E5E5">so some example of digital libraries</font>

35
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:52,229
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you've probably heard of and pretty</font>

36
00:01:50,549 --> 00:01:55,470
much you know there's trillions of

37
00:01:52,229 --> 00:01:58,229
digital libraries out there<font color="#E5E5E5"> one that's</font>

38
00:01:55,470 --> 00:02:00,240
quite interesting to me is the

39
00:01:58,229 --> 00:02:02,729
combination of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> pirate bay and</font>

40
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:07,110
bittorrent<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's quite relevant to this</font>

41
00:02:02,729 --> 00:02:10,590
talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so you know whether it's</font>

42
00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:13,200
<font color="#CCCCCC">wikipedia</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> youtube or bittorrent</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you need</font>

43
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:13,680
some way to determine what content goes

44
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:17,608
into the

45
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:19,290
library and what content doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

46
00:02:17,609 --> 00:02:21,540
typical way this is done

47
00:02:19,290 --> 00:02:25,078
maybe you have users who can you know

48
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:29,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">add modifier delete files moderators</font>

49
00:02:25,079 --> 00:02:31,709
cannot ban or block users<font color="#E5E5E5"> administrators</font>

50
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:34,950
can hire and fire moderators and finally

51
00:02:31,709 --> 00:02:37,829
<font color="#E5E5E5">the government make sure that</font>

52
00:02:34,950 --> 00:02:39,959
administrators are following laws<font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font>

53
00:02:37,829 --> 00:02:42,930
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> calling a chain of</font>

54
00:02:39,959 --> 00:02:43,950
command system and you know for most

55
00:02:42,930 --> 00:02:45,389
purposes

56
00:02:43,950 --> 00:02:47,129
you're probably on the internet because

57
00:02:45,389 --> 00:02:49,709
you want to look at some videos of cats

58
00:02:47,129 --> 00:02:54,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">so generally this works pretty good for</font>

59
00:02:49,709 --> 00:02:56,549
everybody<font color="#CCCCCC"> and in some cases</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> though it it</font>

60
00:02:54,510 --> 00:02:58,918
doesn't work so great and there's some

61
00:02:56,549 --> 00:03:02,340
things that<font color="#CCCCCC"> government like to restrict</font>

62
00:02:58,919 --> 00:03:04,260
the sharing of<font color="#E5E5E5"> and and you know whether</font>

63
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:07,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">its criticism of the government or</font>

64
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:10,048
intellectual property and you know you

65
00:03:07,950 --> 00:03:11,849
probably have your own personal opinion

66
00:03:10,049 --> 00:03:17,760
on which of these things should and

67
00:03:11,849 --> 00:03:19,649
should not be legal to share<font color="#E5E5E5"> and but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

68
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:21,149
think probably everybody in this room is

69
00:03:19,650 --> 00:03:23,159
going to agree that you should be able

70
00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:27,449
to for example<font color="#CCCCCC"> criticize the government</font>

71
00:03:23,159 --> 00:03:29,849
<font color="#E5E5E5">and so really</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> your</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your personal</font>

72
00:03:27,449 --> 00:03:32,549
definition of the word<font color="#E5E5E5"> censorship is</font>

73
00:03:29,849 --> 00:03:35,220
going to vary<font color="#E5E5E5"> and but what all of these</font>

74
00:03:32,549 --> 00:03:37,229
different things have in common is they

75
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:40,319
require humans to make policy decisions

76
00:03:37,229 --> 00:03:45,329
on which<font color="#CCCCCC"> kinds of these things you can</font>

77
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:47,009
and cannot share and<font color="#E5E5E5"> 11 problem is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> any</font>

78
00:03:45,329 --> 00:03:49,409
<font color="#CCCCCC">time these</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> decisions are made by a</font>

79
00:03:47,009 --> 00:03:54,509
government<font color="#CCCCCC"> you get the potential for</font>

80
00:03:49,409 --> 00:03:56,069
censorship<font color="#CCCCCC"> so you know and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm lucky to</font>

81
00:03:54,509 --> 00:03:58,619
live in a society where<font color="#CCCCCC"> I can't even</font>

82
00:03:56,069 --> 00:04:00,629
<font color="#E5E5E5">talk about this but in past societies</font>

83
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:03,359
and you know other places on earth and

84
00:04:00,629 --> 00:04:04,828
perhaps in the future<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know people</font>

85
00:04:03,359 --> 00:04:07,500
might not be so lucky

86
00:04:04,829 --> 00:04:10,739
<font color="#E5E5E5">so what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm interested in talking about</font>

87
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:13,409
today is where the<font color="#CCCCCC"> system where these</font>

88
00:04:10,739 --> 00:04:15,720
policies are made by the participants of

89
00:04:13,409 --> 00:04:20,399
the network rather than by the

90
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:22,650
government<font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the question here is how</font>

91
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:25,799
can we create a censorship resistant

92
00:04:22,650 --> 00:04:27,270
digital library<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to explain a</font>

93
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:29,430
couple different ways<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've been</font>

94
00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:31,590
thinking about the problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you know</font>

95
00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:32,759
at some point you might think<font color="#E5E5E5"> why are</font>

96
00:04:31,590 --> 00:04:35,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">you telling me this</font>

97
00:04:32,759 --> 00:04:38,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">trust me it's gonna come together when</font>

98
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:41,159
<font color="#E5E5E5">you see the design so the first issue</font>

99
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:43,289
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've been thinking about is you</font>

100
00:04:41,159 --> 00:04:45,300
know there's kind of two ways to fight

101
00:04:43,289 --> 00:04:48,030
censorship<font color="#CCCCCC"> as far as I'm concerned you</font>

102
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:49,590
can hide<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that's what the Tor network</font>

103
00:04:48,030 --> 00:04:52,258
is all about

104
00:04:49,590 --> 00:04:56,489
I<font color="#CCCCCC"> disguises the physical location of</font>

105
00:04:52,259 --> 00:04:59,550
your computer<font color="#E5E5E5"> and also you can replicate</font>

106
00:04:56,490 --> 00:05:02,400
information and the idea is if you make

107
00:04:59,550 --> 00:05:04,590
it easy to replicate information from

108
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:06,359
place to place you can replicate that

109
00:05:04,590 --> 00:05:09,869
information faster than the government

110
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:12,569
can take it down<font color="#E5E5E5"> and these two models</font>

111
00:05:09,870 --> 00:05:15,270
are there each good<font color="#CCCCCC"> for different kinds</font>

112
00:05:12,569 --> 00:05:18,060
of situations<font color="#CCCCCC"> what I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to talk</font>

113
00:05:15,270 --> 00:05:25,650
about today is focused on replication

114
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:28,259
<font color="#E5E5E5">not on hiding so 11 really interesting</font>

115
00:05:25,650 --> 00:05:31,289
type of network is<font color="#E5E5E5"> a darknet basically</font>

116
00:05:28,259 --> 00:05:32,639
<font color="#CCCCCC">it's friend of friend you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> only connect</font>

117
00:05:31,289 --> 00:05:35,789
to people you know and you need an

118
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:37,349
<font color="#E5E5E5">invited to join and for a lot of</font>

119
00:05:35,789 --> 00:05:40,770
applications this is a really good

120
00:05:37,349 --> 00:05:43,229
solution because it tends to keep

121
00:05:40,770 --> 00:05:46,859
<font color="#CCCCCC">government's out but on the other hand</font>

122
00:05:43,229 --> 00:05:49,650
it also tends to keep everyone out<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

123
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:51,539
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> that makes it very secure and but</font>

124
00:05:49,650 --> 00:05:54,599
it's also a little bit less accessible

125
00:05:51,539 --> 00:05:57,029
<font color="#E5E5E5">then system that you can get to publicly</font>

126
00:05:54,599 --> 00:06:00,300
<font color="#CCCCCC">so today I'm going to be talking about a</font>

127
00:05:57,029 --> 00:06:04,590
non<font color="#E5E5E5"> darknet solution</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i want a library</font>

128
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:06,960
that everybody can read from when you're

129
00:06:04,590 --> 00:06:09,299
designing any new system including a<font color="#CCCCCC"> p2p</font>

130
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:12,568
system and you have to think about how

131
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:15,360
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> system is going to be organized so a</font>

132
00:06:12,569 --> 00:06:17,940
chain of command is a really easy way to

133
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:21,120
organize your system and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's easy to</font>

134
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:23,610
program and enforce the rules<font color="#E5E5E5"> so you</font>

135
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:26,190
might have one master server controlling

136
00:06:23,610 --> 00:06:27,779
the other computers and you<font color="#CCCCCC"> you might</font>

137
00:06:26,190 --> 00:06:31,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">have one human at the top of your</font>

138
00:06:27,779 --> 00:06:33,090
organization and<font color="#E5E5E5"> of course this</font>

139
00:06:31,110 --> 00:06:36,779
this creates a problem for certain kinds

140
00:06:33,090 --> 00:06:38,789
of networks because it<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have a single</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">applying this principle from physical</font>

00:08:26,860 --> 00:08:31,750
instead of having a single owner who has

00:08:29,169 --> 00:08:35,559
the keys to turn off the system<font color="#E5E5E5"> and have</font>

a lot of owners of the system<font color="#CCCCCC"> and so</font>

183
00:08:35,559 --> 00:08:42,549
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i would say a partially solved</font>

well but they require invites and

00:08:45,910 --> 00:08:52,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">bittorrent can do this well but it's not</font>

188
00:08:52,870 --> 00:08:56,360
might say well<font color="#CCCCCC"> i def</font>

189
00:08:54,410 --> 00:08:59,149
only search for torrents before right

190
00:08:56,360 --> 00:09:02,209
<font color="#E5E5E5">and and that's kind of where the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Pirate</font>

191
00:08:59,149 --> 00:09:04,579
<font color="#CCCCCC">Bay comes in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and so the way</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> bittorrent</font>

192
00:09:02,209 --> 00:09:07,849
works<font color="#E5E5E5"> at it's a system for sharing</font>

193
00:09:04,579 --> 00:09:11,388
individual files<font color="#E5E5E5"> but it doesn't include</font>

194
00:09:07,850 --> 00:09:15,379
a way to discover new files<font color="#E5E5E5"> so you can</font>

195
00:09:11,389 --> 00:09:18,230
think of it as each each file exists

196
00:09:15,379 --> 00:09:20,449
independently in bittorrent<font color="#CCCCCC"> so what the</font>

197
00:09:18,230 --> 00:09:24,379
<font color="#CCCCCC">pirate bay and a lot of other sites have</font>

198
00:09:20,449 --> 00:09:26,628
done is add search functionality<font color="#E5E5E5"> on top</font>

199
00:09:24,379 --> 00:09:29,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">of this so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> bittorrent takes care of the</font>

200
00:09:26,629 --> 00:09:34,100
retrieving the file and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> pirate bay</font>

201
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:39,290
takes care of searching for the file so

00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:42,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> pirate bay actually is succeeding in</font>

203
00:09:39,290 --> 00:09:44,810
a lot of ways at<font color="#E5E5E5"> but going to jail</font>

204
00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:47,660
shouldn't really be part of you know

205
00:09:44,810 --> 00:09:53,388
your site administrators job description

206
00:09:47,660 --> 00:09:55,550
at<font color="#E5E5E5"> so one so at the Pirate Bay is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> at</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

207
00:09:53,389 --> 00:09:59,029
be clear a site that's run by you know a

208
00:09:55,550 --> 00:10:01,160
small number of people<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so the</font>

209
00:09:59,029 --> 00:10:04,250
question here then is how is it that

210
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:07,819
bittorrent can be ownerless<font color="#CCCCCC"> whereas the</font>

211
00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:09,829
<font color="#CCCCCC">pirate bay needs</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> an owner</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so as far as</font>

212
00:10:07,819 --> 00:10:11,509
I'm concerned this difference is all

213
00:10:09,829 --> 00:10:15,229
about the difference between static

214
00:10:11,509 --> 00:10:18,259
content and dynamic content and so for

215
00:10:15,230 --> 00:10:20,389
static content<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a good example</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

216
00:10:18,259 --> 00:10:24,350
is just a book you know Moby<font color="#E5E5E5"> Dick is</font>

217
00:10:20,389 --> 00:10:27,769
<font color="#CCCCCC">Moby Dick</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at the content of the book is</font>

218
00:10:24,350 --> 00:10:29,720
not going to change over time<font color="#CCCCCC"> I don't</font>

219
00:10:27,769 --> 00:10:31,759
know if<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think a lot of you know what a</font>

220
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:33,380
card catalog is but you know it's the

221
00:10:31,759 --> 00:10:35,930
thing at a library that keeps track of

222
00:10:33,380 --> 00:10:39,380
which books are there and where they all

223
00:10:35,930 --> 00:10:41,180
are right so the card<font color="#CCCCCC"> catalog of a</font>

224
00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:43,370
library is what i would call dynamic

225
00:10:41,180 --> 00:10:45,559
content<font color="#CCCCCC"> the library</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is always going to</font>

226
00:10:43,370 --> 00:10:49,459
be adding new books removing books or

227
00:10:45,559 --> 00:10:52,850
even<font color="#E5E5E5"> moving books around</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so in that case</font>

228
00:10:49,459 --> 00:10:55,189
you need to be able to change the

229
00:10:52,850 --> 00:10:57,170
content so<font color="#CCCCCC"> bittorrent is a little bit</font>

230
00:10:55,189 --> 00:11:02,990
like a book in this case and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Pirate</font>

231
00:10:57,170 --> 00:11:06,839
<font color="#CCCCCC">Bay is like a card catalog</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so for static</font>

232
00:11:02,990 --> 00:11:09,090
content<font color="#CCCCCC"> there's some really cool ways to</font>

233
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:12,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">share the data</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> without requiring an</font>

234
00:11:09,090 --> 00:11:15,960
owner<font color="#E5E5E5"> so a common way to do this is</font>

235
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:18,600
called content hashing<font color="#E5E5E5"> so you take your</font>

236
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:21,420
content<font color="#CCCCCC"> run it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> through a cryptographic</font>

237
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:25,950
hash function and that will produce a

238
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:28,110
short<font color="#E5E5E5"> binary string called a hash</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and so</font>

239
00:11:25,950 --> 00:11:31,260
you can think of this hash in a lot of

240
00:11:28,110 --> 00:11:33,120
cases as a link to the content<font color="#CCCCCC"> the hash</font>

241
00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:36,660
is a constant size and really

242
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:38,610
importantly it's difficult to reverse<font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font>

243
00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:42,270
that means it's hard to come up with

244
00:11:38,610 --> 00:11:45,900
another file that has the same hash<font color="#CCCCCC"> d39</font>

245
00:11:42,270 --> 00:11:49,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">b25 8e</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and that's really important</font>

246
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:52,890
because if you start with the hash which

247
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:54,960
is the link<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can download a copy of</font>

248
00:11:52,890 --> 00:11:58,110
the content even from somebody you don't

249
00:11:54,960 --> 00:12:01,140
trust and once you finish downloading

250
00:11:58,110 --> 00:12:02,850
the content<font color="#E5E5E5"> all you have to do is run</font>

251
00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:05,490
the hash function on the content and

252
00:12:02,850 --> 00:12:07,050
check that it matches the hash that you

253
00:12:05,490 --> 00:12:09,600
started with and that way you can tell

254
00:12:07,050 --> 00:12:12,209
whether your content is authentic or not

255
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:14,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">and this is used by</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> bittorrent</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

256
00:12:12,210 --> 00:12:19,530
actually a lot of other systems

257
00:12:14,190 --> 00:12:24,120
including<font color="#CCCCCC"> non peer-to-peer systems so</font>

258
00:12:19,530 --> 00:12:26,160
dynamic content<font color="#E5E5E5"> one thing is content</font>

259
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:29,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">taking a hash of the content doesn't</font>

260
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:30,810
really help because you know the content

261
00:12:29,010 --> 00:12:33,540
can change which means the hash will

262
00:12:30,810 --> 00:12:36,989
change so the real question here is then

263
00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:39,900
who is allowed to change the content and

264
00:12:36,990 --> 00:12:44,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">Fred</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for a decentralized library how can</font>

265
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:46,230
you enforce that rule<font color="#E5E5E5"> one tool that's</font>

266
00:12:44,370 --> 00:12:48,240
going to be really helpful for this is

267
00:12:46,230 --> 00:12:52,800
called<font color="#CCCCCC"> a public-key</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> cryptography</font>

268
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:55,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">generally how this works let's say Bob</font>

269
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:58,290
generates a cryptographic key pair with

270
00:12:55,650 --> 00:13:00,600
a private key in public key<font color="#CCCCCC"> he gives the</font>

271
00:12:58,290 --> 00:13:03,510
public key out freely<font color="#E5E5E5"> but he doesn't</font>

272
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:06,870
show anyone the private key and when he

273
00:13:03,510 --> 00:13:09,720
wants to write something he can sign it

274
00:13:06,870 --> 00:13:13,740

275
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:18,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">and anybody who has the public key can</font>

276
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:21,850
verify that what he<font color="#E5E5E5"> signed was authentic</font>

277
00:13:18,790 --> 00:13:25,449
<font color="#E5E5E5">and this typically is used by only a</font>

279
00:13:25,450 --> 00:13:34,120
groups of arbitrary<font color="#CCCCCC"> size</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> very well so</font>

280
00:13:32,260 --> 00:13:37,270
for the system that<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm going to build</font>

281
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:39,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">here's an overview of the properties</font>

282
00:13:37,270 --> 00:13:41,230
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'd like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it to have you should</font>

283
00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:42,820
obviously be able to search for files

284
00:13:41,230 --> 00:13:45,370
and view them

285
00:13:42,820 --> 00:13:47,890
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> shouldn't require an invite it should</font>

286
00:13:45,370 --> 00:13:49,960
be physically<font color="#CCCCCC"> decentralize but it should</font>

287
00:13:47,890 --> 00:13:51,460
also be<font color="#E5E5E5"> decentralized in terms of</font>

288
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:53,350
ownership

289
00:13:51,460 --> 00:13:56,170
nobody should have a key to turn the

290
00:13:53,350 --> 00:13:58,840
system off<font color="#E5E5E5"> and obviously that includes</font>

291
00:13:56,170 --> 00:14:03,459
me and<font color="#CCCCCC"> and finally it should be</font>

292
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:04,960
resistant to spam and<font color="#E5E5E5"> when</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm thinking</font>

293
00:14:03,460 --> 00:14:06,580
about the user interface it should

294
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:09,400
really look something like this

295
00:14:06,580 --> 00:14:12,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">basically you type text into a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> textbox</font>

296
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:14,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">you can perform a search that that gives</font>

297
00:14:12,430 --> 00:14:17,949
you a list of files and then you can

298
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:21,190
select<font color="#E5E5E5"> a file in order to view it and so</font>

299
00:14:17,950 --> 00:14:25,960
a pretty simple user interface<font color="#E5E5E5"> concept</font>

300
00:14:21,190 --> 00:14:29,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">so now</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm going to explain how i went</font>

301
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:31,930
about designing this system and this is

302
00:14:29,650 --> 00:14:34,990
called<font color="#CCCCCC"> eggs and rhea</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the system that</font>

303
00:14:31,930 --> 00:14:36,489
<font color="#E5E5E5">I've built</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so in order to meet the</font>

304
00:14:34,990 --> 00:14:38,830
requirements there's kind of three

305
00:14:36,490 --> 00:14:41,140
things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm thinking about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we need</font>

306
00:14:38,830 --> 00:14:43,150
to store the data for the system<font color="#E5E5E5"> we need</font>

307
00:14:41,140 --> 00:14:45,550
to be able to exchange it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we need</font>

308
00:14:43,150 --> 00:14:48,670
some way to determine<font color="#E5E5E5"> ownership of the</font>

309
00:14:45,550 --> 00:14:50,709
data that is how do you decide what data

310
00:14:48,670 --> 00:14:53,349
does and does not go into the library

311
00:14:50,710 --> 00:14:59,440
and so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm going to explain each of</font>

312
00:14:53,350 --> 00:15:01,690
these three things in order<font color="#E5E5E5"> so the</font>

313
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:04,900
general structure that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I've got here is</font>

314
00:15:01,690 --> 00:15:09,190
there's a central index for the library

315
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:11,829
and inside the index are a bunch of each

316
00:15:09,190 --> 00:15:12,490
entry in the index is a pair of two

317
00:15:11,830 --> 00:15:15,490
things

318
00:15:12,490 --> 00:15:18,310
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> one is a human-readable name for the</font>

319
00:15:15,490 --> 00:15:22,210
file and the other thing is a<font color="#CCCCCC"> Content</font>

320
00:15:18,310 --> 00:15:24,670
hash of the file and that is basically a

321
00:15:22,210 --> 00:15:30,160
link that you can use to retrieve the

322
00:15:24,670 --> 00:15:32,229
<font color="#CCCCCC">fall</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> file so owners of the system will</font>

323
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:35,140
be able to make contributions

324
00:15:32,230 --> 00:15:38,440
<font color="#CCCCCC">to the index and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and the index is more</font>

325
00:15:35,140 --> 00:15:42,069
or less the new and interesting thing

326
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:45,640
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm doing so you can think of the</font>

327
00:15:42,070 --> 00:15:48,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">Pirate Bay is as</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> centralized index of</font>

328
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:54,189
files and I want to make a<font color="#E5E5E5"> decentralized</font>

329
00:15:48,190 --> 00:15:56,530
index so<font color="#E5E5E5"> one thing to note is every</font>

330
00:15:54,190 --> 00:15:59,110
participant in the network is going to

331
00:15:56,530 --> 00:16:01,750
keep in<font color="#E5E5E5"> keep a copy of the entire index</font>

332
00:15:59,110 --> 00:16:04,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">but you don't need to download every</font>

333
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:06,910
file you only download the files that

334
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:09,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">you're interested in</font>

335
00:16:06,910 --> 00:16:12,069
so the way the date is going to flow

336
00:16:09,130 --> 00:16:15,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">here you type in a search string say</font>

337
00:16:12,070 --> 00:16:19,660
kittens and<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you search your index</font>

338
00:16:15,460 --> 00:16:21,940
you do that locally on your computer<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

339
00:16:19,660 --> 00:16:24,610
that will give you a list of names and

340
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:28,690
hash<font color="#CCCCCC"> pairs and then given one of those</font>

341
00:16:24,610 --> 00:16:30,460
hash<font color="#E5E5E5"> pairs that identifies a file that</font>

342
00:16:28,690 --> 00:16:35,770
you can then download from the network

343
00:16:30,460 --> 00:16:38,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">so now</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm going to talk about a data</font>

344
00:16:35,770 --> 00:16:41,380
structure called<font color="#E5E5E5"> independently feed and</font>

345
00:16:38,710 --> 00:16:44,530
even for people who don't like hearing

346
00:16:41,380 --> 00:16:47,080
the phrase<font color="#E5E5E5"> data structure</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i hope you'll</font>

347
00:16:44,530 --> 00:16:50,410
be able to understand this<font color="#E5E5E5"> so part of</font>

348
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:53,890
what makes it so great is its simplicity

349
00:16:50,410 --> 00:16:57,520
and elegance<font color="#E5E5E5"> the way independently feed</font>

350
00:16:53,890 --> 00:17:00,310
works<font color="#E5E5E5"> you take your data and you have it</font>

351
00:16:57,520 --> 00:17:03,670
broken<font color="#E5E5E5"> up into blocks and the only way</font>

352
00:17:00,310 --> 00:17:07,119
that you can modify the data

353
00:17:03,670 --> 00:17:10,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">independently</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> feed is the old you</font>

354
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:13,389
you can add a new block<font color="#E5E5E5"> onto the end</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font>

355
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:15,490
you're never allowed to modify an

356
00:17:13,390 --> 00:17:20,650
existing block and you're never allowed

357
00:17:15,490 --> 00:17:22,540
to delete an existing block and<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the</font>

358
00:17:20,650 --> 00:17:27,880
way I've chosen to represent the data in

359
00:17:22,540 --> 00:17:31,270
my system is as a set of different

360
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:33,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">append only feeds</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> first thing at</font>

361
00:17:31,270 --> 00:17:36,370
the top in<font color="#E5E5E5"> orange</font>

362
00:17:33,580 --> 00:17:39,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's the identity feed</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> idea</font>

363
00:17:36,370 --> 00:17:45,340
here is anybody can sign up for a new

364
00:17:39,310 --> 00:17:52,179
identity<font color="#E5E5E5"> by adding an entry onto the</font>

365
00:17:45,340 --> 00:17:55,689
identity<font color="#E5E5E5"> feed and then each identity has</font>

366
00:17:52,180 --> 00:18:00,430
their own<font color="#E5E5E5"> metadata feed and the metadata</font>

367
00:17:55,690 --> 00:18:03,310
feed consists of a bunch of<font color="#CCCCCC"> name</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hash</font>

368
00:18:00,430 --> 00:18:08,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">pairs and the metadata feeds are what</font>

369
00:18:03,310 --> 00:18:10,929
make up the index<font color="#E5E5E5"> so and then obviously</font>

370
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:13,659
the metadata feeds have links to the

371
00:18:10,930 --> 00:18:16,870
actual files in the network<font color="#CCCCCC"> so we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have a</font>

372
00:18:13,660 --> 00:18:21,220
bunch of<font color="#E5E5E5"> append only feeds</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> but we need a</font>

373
00:18:16,870 --> 00:18:23,290
way to implement each feed<font color="#CCCCCC"> so now i'm</font>

374
00:18:21,220 --> 00:18:27,430
going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Bitcoin for a reason</font>

375
00:18:23,290 --> 00:18:30,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">that will become apparent very soon so</font>

376
00:18:27,430 --> 00:18:35,020
<font color="#CCCCCC">a1</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really common question about bitcoin</font>

377
00:18:30,580 --> 00:18:37,780
is what is it and is it a payment system

378
00:18:35,020 --> 00:18:40,600
or a commodity or<font color="#E5E5E5"> currency is it a</font>

379
00:18:37,780 --> 00:18:43,180
network<font color="#E5E5E5"> it is all of those things but</font>

380
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:46,629
today<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm going to talk about Bitcoin as</font>

381
00:18:43,180 --> 00:18:48,880
a database<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's this thing called the</font>

382
00:18:46,630 --> 00:18:52,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">Bitcoin</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> blockchain you probably at least</font>

383
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:56,020
heard that term and and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's an append</font>

384
00:18:52,390 --> 00:18:59,290
only feed of financial transactions so

385
00:18:56,020 --> 00:19:02,950
each block in the Bitcoin<font color="#E5E5E5"> blockchain has</font>

386
00:18:59,290 --> 00:19:05,230
a bunch of financial transactions inside

387
00:19:02,950 --> 00:19:07,810
of it and the way it<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of works is</font>

388
00:19:05,230 --> 00:19:10,930
anybody can submit a transaction to the

389
00:19:07,810 --> 00:19:13,960
network and Bitcoin miners can<font color="#E5E5E5"> append</font>

390
00:19:10,930 --> 00:19:15,670
new blocks to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> blockchain</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

391
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:16,420
there's a new block about every<font color="#E5E5E5"> 10</font>

392
00:19:15,670 --> 00:19:21,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">minutes</font>

393
00:19:16,420 --> 00:19:24,490
so one question about the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Bitcoin</font>

394
00:19:21,940 --> 00:19:27,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">blockchain is is it possible to store</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">non-financial data inside the block</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">chain</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and so I've shown up here a an</font>

397
00:19:33,610 --> 00:19:38,290
example of how to do that in a<font color="#CCCCCC"> human</font>

398
00:19:35,770 --> 00:19:40,810
<font color="#CCCCCC">readable way at this is a valid Bitcoin</font>

00:19:38,290 --> 00:19:45,639
<font color="#E5E5E5">address it says</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> one meet me at the</font>

00:19:50,470 --> 00:19:57,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">Bitcoin</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> address and so by sending</font>

not a particularly efficient way to

409
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:16,659
<font color="#E5E5E5">encode that information and so there are</font>

410
00:20:12,190 --> 00:20:18,850
features of the Bitcoin protocol that

411
00:20:16,660 --> 00:20:21,610
let you store information in<font color="#CCCCCC"> Bitcoin</font>

412
00:20:18,850 --> 00:20:24,699
transactions<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty efficiently and and</font>

413
00:20:21,610 --> 00:20:27,760
what<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm most</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> interested in is something</font>

414
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:30,760
called<font color="#CCCCCC"> opera turn which basically says</font>

415
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:36,580
everything after this is just raw data

416
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:38,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">so another important question is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

417

and in order to exchange data between to

<font color="#CCCCCC">append only feeds and the algorithm is</font>

460
00:22:43,660 --> 00:22:48,580
really simple you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> all you have to</font>

461
00:22:46,539 --> 00:22:50,710
do is basically copy in the missing

462
00:22:48,580 --> 00:22:55,449
blocks and you're done

463
00:22:50,710 --> 00:22:58,659
and so for each<font color="#CCCCCC"> per identity feed the</font>

464
00:22:55,450 --> 00:23:01,510
metadata feed you can replicate that

feed between all users computers in the

466
00:23:01,510 --> 00:23:07,809
network<font color="#CCCCCC"> and you can also use a really</font>

00:23:05,020 --> 00:23:10,809
similar protocol to exchange<font color="#E5E5E5"> static</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">actually implement this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are two</font>

libraries called<font color="#E5E5E5"> hypercore and</font>

471
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:22,150
<font color="#CCCCCC">hyperdrive and if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you're interested in</font>

00:23:19,330 --> 00:23:23,439
distributed systems<font color="#E5E5E5"> or algorithms</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

473
00:23:22,150 --> 00:23:31,179
would<font color="#E5E5E5"> definitely recommend checking</font>

474
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:33,010
those out<font color="#E5E5E5"> so a swarm is a group of</font>

475
00:23:31,179 --> 00:23:35,770
computers that are all connected to each

476

477
00:23:35,770 --> 00:23:43,990
same piece of data so the<font color="#CCCCCC"> different</font>

swarms that are going on<font color="#E5E5E5"> every</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> node is</font>

479
00:23:43,990 --> 00:23:50,530
going to become part of the index warm

480
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:55,090
and these nodes will exchange the

481
00:23:50,530 --> 00:23:58,299
<font color="#E5E5E5">central index of the library and and</font>

482
00:23:55,090 --> 00:24:00,908
each node can also join one or more

00:23:58,299 --> 00:24:03,100
files<font color="#E5E5E5"> swarms you just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> joined the swarm</font>

484
00:24:00,909 --> 00:24:07,450
for the files that you're interested in

485
00:24:03,100 --> 00:24:10,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> finally</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> every node is going to be</font>

00:24:07,450 --> 00:24:12,909
part of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Bitcoin</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> swarm</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> because you</font>

487
00:24:10,330 --> 00:24:17,168
need to access the identity data stored

488
00:24:12,909 --> 00:24:20,230
in the Bitcoin<font color="#E5E5E5"> blockchain so to recap</font>

489
00:24:17,169 --> 00:24:22,990
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> we got our identity feed on top</font>

490
00:24:20,230 --> 00:24:24,669
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's implemented by storing identities</font>

491
00:24:22,990 --> 00:24:28,419
inside<font color="#E5E5E5"> a Bitcoin transaction</font>

492
00:24:24,669 --> 00:24:34,029
<font color="#E5E5E5">and for each of the individual feeds</font>

493
00:24:28,419 --> 00:24:35,919
<font color="#CCCCCC">that's implemented</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with hypercore so now</font>

494
00:24:34,029 --> 00:24:38,320
the kind of tricky problem is

495
00:24:35,919 --> 00:24:40,419
determining ownership of the library who

496
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:41,859
gets to decide what goes into it and

497
00:24:40,419 --> 00:24:43,239
what doesn't

498
00:24:41,859 --> 00:24:47,139
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk about a couple</font>

499
00:24:43,239 --> 00:24:50,320
different strategies<font color="#CCCCCC"> one</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> strategy that</font>

500
00:24:47,139 --> 00:24:53,799
you could try is<font color="#E5E5E5"> anarchy</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> anybody can</font>

501
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:56,439
add or delete data of course anybody

502
00:24:53,799 --> 00:24:59,168
also includes the government so you know

503
00:24:56,440 --> 00:25:02,169
a government can just delete the things

504
00:24:59,169 --> 00:25:05,919
that it<font color="#CCCCCC"> once</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and that's not very</font>

505
00:25:02,169 --> 00:25:09,369
censorship resistant<font color="#E5E5E5"> it is possible to</font>

506
00:25:05,919 --> 00:25:12,190
make an ad only library

507
00:25:09,369 --> 00:25:13,988
however the problem here is the

508
00:25:12,190 --> 00:25:17,799
government can just create a million

509
00:25:13,989 --> 00:25:19,779
fake copies of a particular thing that

510
00:25:17,799 --> 00:25:23,679
<font color="#CCCCCC">it dislikes making it impossible for</font>

511
00:25:19,779 --> 00:25:25,090
users to find the real copy<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

512
00:25:23,679 --> 00:25:27,609
<font color="#E5E5E5">think that there's a really interesting</font>

513
00:25:25,090 --> 00:25:32,080
relationship here between<font color="#CCCCCC"> spam and</font>

514
00:25:27,609 --> 00:25:34,389
censorship<font color="#E5E5E5"> could you use an algorithm to</font>

515
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:37,418
differentiate the spam files from the

516
00:25:34,389 --> 00:25:40,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">real files one thing right now</font>

517
00:25:37,419 --> 00:25:42,429
algorithms aren't very smart and for

518
00:25:40,090 --> 00:25:46,359
example you could write rewrite the book

519
00:25:42,429 --> 00:25:47,769
1984 to be pro big brother and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I don't</font>

520
00:25:46,359 --> 00:25:52,779
<font color="#E5E5E5">think there's any algorithm that could</font>

521
00:25:47,769 --> 00:25:55,450
really detect<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's a subtle</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> semantic</font>

522
00:25:52,779 --> 00:25:58,299
level change<font color="#E5E5E5"> and even if it could though</font>

523
00:25:55,450 --> 00:26:01,359
<font color="#E5E5E5">you have to decide</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> who's the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> person</font>

524
00:25:58,299 --> 00:26:03,100
who's writing<font color="#E5E5E5"> the algorithms so and then</font>

525
00:26:01,359 --> 00:26:05,080
you get back to the ownership question

526
00:26:03,100 --> 00:26:09,189
so it's really just kicking the can down

527
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:13,178
the road there as far as i know nothing

528
00:26:09,190 --> 00:26:16,059
really uses this particular model<font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font>

529
00:26:13,179 --> 00:26:17,980
what about Wikipedia Wikipedia is

530
00:26:16,059 --> 00:26:19,629
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> great example of chain of</font>

535
00:26:30,039 --> 00:26:36,399
by pretty much every system ever because

536
00:26:33,580 --> 00:26:37,389
it's simple it's efficient<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's easy to</font>

537
00:26:36,399 --> 00:26:41,079

538
00:26:37,389 --> 00:26:42,519
<font color="#E5E5E5">you only</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> well the main disadvantage is</font>

539
00:26:41,079 --> 00:26:45,039
that it's got a single point of failure

540
00:26:42,519 --> 00:26:48,459
which also makes it definitely

541
00:26:45,039 --> 00:26:50,139
vulnerable<font color="#E5E5E5"> test censorship</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so now i'm</font>

542
00:26:48,459 --> 00:26:53,229
going to talk about a third and very

00:26:50,139 --> 00:26:55,570
weird<font color="#E5E5E5"> ownership model</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> uh and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm calling</font>

00:26:53,229 --> 00:26:57,789
this resource burn<font color="#E5E5E5"> when I'm talking</font>

545
00:26:55,570 --> 00:27:01,809
about resources really more or less<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

546
00:26:57,789 --> 00:27:03,519
mean money and this system is simple but

547
00:27:01,809 --> 00:27:06,849
<font color="#E5E5E5">counterintuitive</font>

548
00:27:03,519 --> 00:27:09,789
so the idea is that anybody can become

549
00:27:06,849 --> 00:27:11,139
an owner of the system and<font color="#CCCCCC"> but if you</font>

550
00:27:09,789 --> 00:27:13,809
want to become an owner you have to

551
00:27:11,139 --> 00:27:18,399
destroy some resources in order to

552
00:27:13,809 --> 00:27:22,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">Ernest</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> an ownership stake and and that</font>

553
00:27:18,399 --> 00:27:25,059
prevents spammers<font color="#E5E5E5"> from from joining the</font>

554
00:27:22,690 --> 00:27:28,929
system or from having too much influence

555
00:27:25,059 --> 00:27:31,599
because it becomes too expensive to spam

556
00:27:28,929 --> 00:27:35,169
<font color="#E5E5E5">and and you could think of this as</font>

557
00:27:31,599 --> 00:27:37,899
paying to be an owner and except it's

558
00:27:35,169 --> 00:27:40,570
not a traditional payment because<font color="#E5E5E5"> no one</font>

559
00:27:37,899 --> 00:27:45,008
is receiving the money<font color="#E5E5E5"> the money is</font>

560
00:27:40,570 --> 00:27:47,139
being destroyed so<font color="#E5E5E5"> that sounds pretty</font>

561
00:27:45,009 --> 00:27:49,269
crazy<font color="#CCCCCC"> couldn't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> possibly work</font>

562
00:27:47,139 --> 00:27:51,728
yes<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is actually exactly what</font>

563
00:27:49,269 --> 00:27:54,459
bitcoin is doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so when you hear</font>

564
00:27:51,729 --> 00:27:56,589
about<font color="#CCCCCC"> Bitcoin mining a lot of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people say</font>

565
00:27:54,459 --> 00:27:59,229
oh well<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're validating Bitcoin</font>

566
00:27:56,589 --> 00:28:02,200
transactions or maybe people say they're

567
00:27:59,229 --> 00:28:03,459
discovering new bitcoins<font color="#CCCCCC"> these</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> things</font>

568
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:06,669
aren't exactly true

569
00:28:03,459 --> 00:28:09,549
<font color="#CCCCCC">bitcoin mining is actually intentionally</font>

570
00:28:06,669 --> 00:28:12,609
forcing people to<font color="#E5E5E5"> waste huge amounts of</font>

571
00:28:09,549 --> 00:28:17,019
electricity and<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that was the crucial</font>

572
00:28:12,609 --> 00:28:20,168
innovation<font color="#E5E5E5"> behind bitcoin and actually</font>

573
00:28:17,019 --> 00:28:22,719
it is succeeding on a massive scale<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

574
00:28:20,169 --> 00:28:30,909
<font color="#E5E5E5">Bitcoin</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> users</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about as much electricity</font>

575
00:28:22,719 --> 00:28:32,679
as the nation of<font color="#CCCCCC"> Jamaica so there's a</font>

576
00:28:30,909 --> 00:28:35,829
there's another way to think about

577
00:28:32,679 --> 00:28:39,219
destroying resources<font color="#E5E5E5"> now that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Bitcoin</font>

578
00:28:35,829 --> 00:28:42,428
exists<font color="#CCCCCC"> and so one important aspect of</font>

579
00:28:39,219 --> 00:28:47,559
the Bitcoin network is anybody can send

580
00:28:42,429 --> 00:28:49,869
money to anybody else<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so if we could</font>

581
00:28:47,559 --> 00:28:51,010
create a way to provably<font color="#E5E5E5"> destroy</font>

582
00:28:49,869 --> 00:28:53,889
bitcoins

583
00:28:51,010 --> 00:28:57,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">then that gives us a way and to</font>

584
00:28:53,890 --> 00:29:00,850
basically<font color="#CCCCCC"> burn resources for ownership</font>

585
00:28:57,700 --> 00:29:03,130
in our network<font color="#E5E5E5"> so there's something</font>

586
00:29:00,850 --> 00:29:06,370
called<font color="#E5E5E5"> unspent</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> able addresses</font>

587
00:29:03,130 --> 00:29:08,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">I've got one of the most famous unspent</font>

588
00:29:06,370 --> 00:29:12,189
<font color="#CCCCCC">able address is at the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bottom</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's one</font>

589
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:15,669
<font color="#CCCCCC">bitcoin eater address don't send</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> f 59 k</font>

590
00:29:12,190 --> 00:29:19,300
ue<font color="#E5E5E5"> and and this actually has a couple</font>

591
00:29:15,670 --> 00:29:21,580
thousand bucks in it right now and<font color="#CCCCCC"> at</font>

592
00:29:19,300 --> 00:29:24,909
the interesting thing here is money can

593
00:29:21,580 --> 00:29:27,189
go in<font color="#E5E5E5"> but it can never leave so those</font>

594
00:29:24,910 --> 00:29:30,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">whatever</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> three</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bitcoins that are in</font>

595
00:29:27,190 --> 00:29:31,660
there are now destroyed forever<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it's</font>

596
00:29:30,100 --> 00:29:36,459
easy to make your own<font color="#CCCCCC"> son spendable</font>

597
00:29:31,660 --> 00:29:39,100
address<font color="#CCCCCC"> so the great thing about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bitcoin</font>

598
00:29:36,460 --> 00:29:41,050
is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's easy to verify that</font>

599
00:29:39,100 --> 00:29:43,959
somebody has sent a particular amount of

600
00:29:41,050 --> 00:29:46,629
money into a nun spendable address<font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font>

601
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:50,950
what we can say is if you want to sign

602
00:29:46,630 --> 00:29:54,190
up for an identity in the system like a

603
00:29:50,950 --> 00:29:56,650
user like a<font color="#E5E5E5"> username or an account</font>

604
00:29:54,190 --> 00:29:59,200
basically if you want an identity<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

605
00:29:56,650 --> 00:30:01,330
have to pay a fixed price for that and

606
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:05,320
we can say that each identity has an

607
00:30:01,330 --> 00:30:08,740
equal say in the system<font color="#CCCCCC"> and one</font>

608
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:10,780
important thing to note about this is if

609
00:30:08,740 --> 00:30:12,730
you have more money<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> does mean you</font>

610
00:30:10,780 --> 00:30:14,830
can sign up<font color="#E5E5E5"> for more identities which is</font>

611
00:30:12,730 --> 00:30:20,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's an important thing to understand</font>

612
00:30:14,830 --> 00:30:24,669
<font color="#CCCCCC">so as</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> far as eggs and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> rhea i'm using</font>

613
00:30:20,950 --> 00:30:28,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">Bitcoin</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for two distinct purposes</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> one is</font>

614
00:30:24,670 --> 00:30:31,300
<font color="#CCCCCC">I'm asking people to burn bitcoins to</font>

615
00:30:28,210 --> 00:30:33,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">sign up for ownership and the second</font>

616
00:30:31,300 --> 00:30:38,080
thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> I've also using it as a database</font>

617
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:40,150
to store identities<font color="#CCCCCC"> so it's very</font>

618
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:43,210
convenient that you can do both<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of</font>

619
00:30:40,150 --> 00:30:46,630
at the same time so all right<font color="#E5E5E5"> now how</font>

620
00:30:43,210 --> 00:30:50,680
does that design<font color="#E5E5E5"> meet the requirements</font>

621
00:30:46,630 --> 00:30:53,620
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> i described at the start you can</font>

622
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:55,750
search for files<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you do that by</font>

623
00:30:53,620 --> 00:30:59,709
searching your local copy of the

624
00:30:55,750 --> 00:31:03,580
metadata<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can view files you download</font>

625
00:30:59,710 --> 00:31:04,610
those from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> file swarm the files by</font>

626
00:31:03,580 --> 00:31:08,659
the way files<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

627
00:31:04,610 --> 00:31:10,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">lord I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on people's computers and you</font>

628
00:31:08,660 --> 00:31:12,620
download<font color="#E5E5E5"> when you want to download a</font>

629
00:31:10,790 --> 00:31:17,059
file you connect to the other people who

630
00:31:12,620 --> 00:31:19,879
have that file<font color="#E5E5E5"> and another thing there's</font>

631
00:31:17,059 --> 00:31:23,780
no invite required because<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's no</font>

632
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:25,940
invite required and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> network's</font>

633
00:31:23,780 --> 00:31:28,190
already physically<font color="#CCCCCC"> decentralized because</font>

634
00:31:25,940 --> 00:31:31,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">bitcoins physically decentralized and</font>

635
00:31:28,190 --> 00:31:35,299
the only real way<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm connecting</font>

636
00:31:31,970 --> 00:31:36,860
computers together is in a swarm and

637
00:31:35,299 --> 00:31:41,059
also the ownership is decentralized

638
00:31:36,860 --> 00:31:43,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">anybody can sign up for an identity and</font>

639
00:31:41,059 --> 00:31:45,770
I<font color="#CCCCCC"> there's no way for me to prevent</font>

640
00:31:43,850 --> 00:31:48,949
people from signing up for identities

641
00:31:45,770 --> 00:31:51,440
and so and even if even if you can take

642
00:31:48,950 --> 00:31:55,400
out one identity<font color="#CCCCCC"> the network keeps on</font>

643
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:59,750
working pretty pretty well and finally

644
00:31:55,400 --> 00:32:01,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">exam 3 is spam resistant because you</font>

645
00:31:59,750 --> 00:32:04,640
need to pay money to sign up for an

646
00:32:01,460 --> 00:32:09,410
identity<font color="#E5E5E5"> so is spamming the network is</font>

647
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:12,679
too expensive so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'll be honest about</font>

648
00:32:09,410 --> 00:32:15,530
some disadvantages<font color="#E5E5E5"> one thing people</font>

649
00:32:12,679 --> 00:32:17,059
mentioned to me is what if you put you

650
00:32:15,530 --> 00:32:20,418
know the most horrible and disgusting

651
00:32:17,059 --> 00:32:23,870
content on the network as far as that

652
00:32:20,419 --> 00:32:27,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">and it is pretty easy to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> add a downvote</font>

653
00:32:23,870 --> 00:32:31,820
feature and and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i believe that the</font>

654
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:34,399
community can decide for itself<font color="#CCCCCC"> and what</font>

655
00:32:31,820 --> 00:32:38,600
content should and shouldn't be allowed

656
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:41,990
to be part of the index<font color="#CCCCCC"> another thing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

657
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:43,459
this is a single index<font color="#CCCCCC"> that shared by</font>

658
00:32:41,990 --> 00:32:46,040
everybody but of course people have

659
00:32:43,460 --> 00:32:48,380
their own preferences and you want your

660
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:50,299
search to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> customized</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so one thing I'm</font>

661
00:32:48,380 --> 00:32:53,510
thinking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> for that is the ability</font>

662
00:32:50,299 --> 00:32:56,960
to add on filters that is you can say<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

663
00:32:53,510 --> 00:32:59,330
want to see more content from her less

664
00:32:56,960 --> 00:33:02,480
content from him and that customizes

665
00:32:59,330 --> 00:33:05,510
your search results<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the third thing</font>

666
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:07,429
is you know since money is the thing

667
00:33:05,510 --> 00:33:11,270
that you<font color="#CCCCCC"> used to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sign up identities will</font>

668
00:33:07,429 --> 00:33:13,190
this be taken over by corporations and

669
00:33:11,270 --> 00:33:16,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">and maybe they'll use it for you know</font>

670
00:33:13,190 --> 00:33:20,549
<font color="#E5E5E5">disseminating advertisements</font>

671
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:23,039
<font color="#CCCCCC">I say if people act in a selfish and</font>

00:33:20,549 --> 00:33:26,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">quote unquote</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> economically rational</font>

don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> believe that humans are selfish i</font>

675
00:33:30,090 --> 00:33:34,110
think that people are fundamentally good

00:33:31,620 --> 00:33:36,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that there's a lot of people</font>

677
00:33:34,110 --> 00:33:42,689
out there who want to do the right thing

678
00:33:36,330 --> 00:33:44,970
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I didn't just designed this system i</font>

679
00:33:42,690 --> 00:33:46,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">also built it and here's some things</font>

680
00:33:44,970 --> 00:33:50,399
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I thought about when building it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

681
00:33:46,860 --> 00:33:52,799
used<font color="#CCCCCC"> nodejs</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> because the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> peer-to-peer</font>

682
00:33:50,399 --> 00:33:55,949
community is amazing there's so many

683
00:33:52,799 --> 00:33:59,700
great libraries out there<font color="#E5E5E5"> another thing</font>

684
00:33:55,950 --> 00:34:02,429
<font color="#E5E5E5">is when startups a fail fast they mean</font>

685
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:04,980
you want to tackle the hardest problems

686
00:34:02,429 --> 00:34:06,809
first so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hardest problem was</font>

687
00:34:04,980 --> 00:34:10,020
building the kind of plumbing of the

688
00:34:06,809 --> 00:34:12,839
network<font color="#E5E5E5"> now</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I've done</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that and and the</font>

689
00:34:10,020 --> 00:34:14,940
second hardest problem is<font color="#E5E5E5"> is anybody</font>

690
00:34:12,839 --> 00:34:17,580
interested in using it<font color="#E5E5E5"> so that's a</font>

691
00:34:14,940 --> 00:34:20,909
that's what<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> gonna start working on</font>

692
00:34:17,580 --> 00:34:23,609
now and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i've also tried</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to keep it as</font>

693
00:34:20,909 --> 00:34:26,550
simple as possible<font color="#CCCCCC"> i believe that simple</font>

694
00:34:23,609 --> 00:34:28,889
software is not just easier to build<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

695
00:34:26,550 --> 00:34:34,169
but it's also easier to maintain<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

696
00:34:28,889 --> 00:34:37,200
more secure<font color="#E5E5E5"> also a so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I i think the</font>

697
00:34:34,168 --> 00:34:40,618
<font color="#E5E5E5">execution is important even if somebody</font>

698
00:34:37,199 --> 00:34:43,319
else has a better idea<font color="#CCCCCC"> and if it's not</font>

699
00:34:40,619 --> 00:34:47,310
easy to build you know that obviously

700
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:49,679
counts for a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I've</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> also tried to</font>

701
00:34:47,310 --> 00:34:50,429
resist the temptation to reinvent the

702
00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:52,710
wheel

703
00:34:50,429 --> 00:34:55,168
there's a lot of really interesting and

704
00:34:52,710 --> 00:34:57,630
cool<font color="#CCCCCC"> subproblems that you need to solve</font>

705
00:34:55,168 --> 00:35:01,710
to build a system like that and i have

706
00:34:57,630 --> 00:35:04,440
tried to not solve any of them<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm</font>

707
00:35:01,710 --> 00:35:05,580
using other people solutions for many

708
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:09,180
different things

709
00:35:05,580 --> 00:35:12,089

somebody has burned bitcoins and it

714
00:35:21,300 --> 00:35:27,740
gives you a live feed as new people burn

not originally a<font color="#CCCCCC"> JavaScript</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> guys so</font>

00:35:32,119 --> 00:35:37,670
learning<font color="#E5E5E5"> node was at times frustrating</font>

00:35:34,250 --> 00:35:40,730
but uh<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's that's been</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> overall fun and</font>

720
00:35:37,670 --> 00:35:45,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">i'm using a lot of pretty</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> new</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">dependencies which means of course that</font>

722
00:35:45,230 --> 00:35:50,690
means<font color="#E5E5E5"> new dependencies have more bugs</font>

723
00:35:47,540 --> 00:35:52,490
but also<font color="#E5E5E5"> they change faster and you know</font>

724
00:35:50,690 --> 00:35:57,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">I have to be ready</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for libraries that</font>

00:35:52,490 --> 00:36:00,680
are changing out from underneath me and

726
00:35:57,650 --> 00:36:03,650
also<font color="#E5E5E5"> one thing that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I also noticed was</font>

727
00:36:00,680 --> 00:36:05,540
connecting<font color="#CCCCCC"> two computers together is</font>

728
00:36:03,650 --> 00:36:08,180
surprisingly hard and a peer-to-peer

729
00:36:05,540 --> 00:36:10,009
network<font color="#CCCCCC"> i I'm used to client-server</font>

730
00:36:08,180 --> 00:36:11,930
development where you know your

731
00:36:10,010 --> 00:36:13,430
connection just works but with

732
00:36:11,930 --> 00:36:15,799
peer-to-peer connections you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

733
00:36:13,430 --> 00:36:18,259
<font color="#CCCCCC">it's kind of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like a trip back to the</font>

734
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:20,510
back to the early two thousands or

735
00:36:18,260 --> 00:36:22,970
whatever and trying to worry about

736
00:36:20,510 --> 00:36:25,220
firewalls and routers and network

737
00:36:22,970 --> 00:36:27,859
settings and so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I was I was a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> little</font>

738
00:36:25,220 --> 00:36:29,959
surprised by that

739
00:36:27,860 --> 00:36:31,760
now<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm going to show a live demo of the</font>

740
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:35,630
system<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> going to be awesome</font>

741
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:38,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">because either</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it'll work and that'll be</font>

742
00:36:35,630 --> 00:36:46,820
exciting<font color="#CCCCCC"> or it won't work</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and that'll be</font>

743
00:36:38,630 --> 00:36:50,240
fun and one second

744
00:36:46,820 --> 00:36:54,109
so this is the terminal<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably a lot</font>

745
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:58,160
of you have seen it but basically it's a

746
00:36:54,109 --> 00:37:05,690
way to view view files and run commands

747
00:36:58,160 --> 00:37:08,299
on my computer so first off<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm going to</font>

748
00:37:05,690 --> 00:37:12,380
show a list of commands that are

749
00:37:08,300 --> 00:37:15,950
available

750
00:37:12,380 --> 00:37:20,269
<font color="#E5E5E5">so these are the sort of different</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> mini</font>

751
00:37:15,950 --> 00:37:22,970
programs in the network that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I've</font>

752
00:37:20,269 --> 00:37:27,078
provided for people to interact with the

753
00:37:22,970 --> 00:37:29,720
network<font color="#CCCCCC"> as you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can see this is not yet</font>

754
00:37:27,079 --> 00:37:30,619
at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> user interface stage that I had</font>

755
00:37:29,720 --> 00:37:33,319
<font color="#E5E5E5">hope for</font>

756
00:37:30,619 --> 00:37:41,990
so what<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm going to do first is I'm</font>

757
00:37:33,319 --> 00:37:44,990
gonna print out my feed

758
00:37:41,990 --> 00:37:46,879
<font color="#E5E5E5">alright so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I've</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> got three items here</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

759
00:37:44,990 --> 00:37:51,558
so at the top you see the name of the

760
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:54,769
feed and then you also see<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've got read</font>

761
00:37:51,559 --> 00:37:58,099
me in here<font color="#CCCCCC"> I've got the book</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Beowulf and</font>

762
00:37:54,769 --> 00:38:00,019
<font color="#CCCCCC">I have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the book</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Ulysses so what I want</font>

763
00:37:58,099 --> 00:38:19,030
to do now is I'm going to add a new book

764
00:38:00,019 --> 00:38:29,689
to my feed

765
00:38:19,030 --> 00:38:32,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">all at the book Dracula</font>

766
00:38:29,690 --> 00:38:35,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">so basically this tells me what feed</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm</font>

767
00:38:32,750 --> 00:38:40,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">a pending to the name of the book</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and it</font>

768
00:38:35,870 --> 00:38:42,109
gives me a<font color="#CCCCCC"> Content hash of the book</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

769
00:38:40,220 --> 00:38:44,330
yes I do want to write it<font color="#CCCCCC"> so now i'm</font>

770
00:38:42,110 --> 00:38:48,410
going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just print out my feet again</font>

771
00:38:44,330 --> 00:38:49,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">ok cool</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so you can see at the bottom you</font>

772
00:38:48,410 --> 00:38:51,529
might<font color="#E5E5E5"> not be able to see depending on</font>

773
00:38:49,910 --> 00:38:54,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> role you're in but at the bottom</font>

774
00:38:51,530 --> 00:38:59,090
now we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> Dracula</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so now</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

775
00:38:54,770 --> 00:39:02,060
run a script that serves the files<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

776
00:38:59,090 --> 00:39:05,720
that means<font color="#E5E5E5"> it makes them available to</font>

777
00:39:02,060 --> 00:39:09,200
other other peers who want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to</font>

778
00:39:05,720 --> 00:39:12,169
get<font color="#CCCCCC"> ahold of them</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so now</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to go</font>

779
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:14,660
into this other tab<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm going to run</font>

780
00:39:12,170 --> 00:39:16,250
a different<font color="#CCCCCC"> pair of course normally you</font>

781
00:39:14,660 --> 00:39:18,950
would run<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> piers on different</font>

782
00:39:16,250 --> 00:39:21,890
computers<font color="#CCCCCC"> its much</font>

783
00:39:18,950 --> 00:39:25,640
well you know that actually does work<font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

784
00:39:21,890 --> 00:39:30,319
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> 1i have a server running on AWS</font>

785
00:39:25,640 --> 00:39:35,569
<font color="#E5E5E5">with appear on it and but it's easier to</font>

786
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:41,029
demo this way

787
00:39:35,569 --> 00:39:47,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">the first</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ok so what I did</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there was I</font>

788
00:39:41,029 --> 00:39:54,289
tried to run<font color="#E5E5E5"> the same pier twice which</font>

789
00:39:47,180 --> 00:39:57,140
you you can't do so what this does

790
00:39:54,289 --> 00:39:59,390
that's my firewall by the way because it

791
00:39:57,140 --> 00:40:01,459
needs to accept incoming connections<font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font>

792
00:39:59,390 --> 00:40:02,719
what it does here is it<font color="#CCCCCC"> uh looks through</font>

793
00:40:01,459 --> 00:40:06,229
the transactions in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Bitcoin</font>

794
00:40:02,719 --> 00:40:09,559
<font color="#E5E5E5">blockchain</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> when it finds an identity it</font>

795
00:40:06,229 --> 00:40:12,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">joins the swarm for that identity and</font>

796
00:40:09,559 --> 00:40:17,809
then when it's in that identity identity

797
00:40:12,410 --> 00:40:20,209
swarm and it gets the metadata<font color="#CCCCCC"> so okay</font>

798
00:40:17,809 --> 00:40:23,029
you can see now<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sees the file</font>

799
00:40:20,209 --> 00:40:36,109
<font color="#CCCCCC">Dracula so now i'm going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to run another</font>

800
00:40:23,029 --> 00:41:00,940
command<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to retrieve the file Dracula</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">Oh</font>

802
00:41:00,940 --> 00:41:06,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">it didn't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> work so i think i probably</font>

803
00:41:03,849 --> 00:41:09,369
<font color="#E5E5E5">have my</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> timeout</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> set</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> too low and maybe I</font>

804
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:12,730
can fix that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I also might be able to get</font>

805
00:41:09,369 --> 00:41:26,340
another item from that feed<font color="#E5E5E5"> perhaps</font>

806
00:41:12,730 --> 00:41:28,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">Beowulf that how you spell Beowulf</font>

simplest one which is a<font color="#CCCCCC"> the readme</font>

00:42:17,870 --> 00:42:23,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">ok finally it works great so yeah</font>

815
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:26,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">definitely need to work on those</font>

816
00:42:23,390 --> 00:42:28,759
flakiness a<font color="#E5E5E5"> issues</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so what I'm going to</font>

to this folder called<font color="#E5E5E5"> archives</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i can</font>

820
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:40,850
just open that in the finer<font color="#CCCCCC"> yeah you can</font>

821
00:42:37,640 --> 00:42:43,549
definitely read that right and so you've

822
00:42:40,850 --> 00:42:47,029
got this folder<font color="#CCCCCC"> readme DMD</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and then the</font>

823
00:42:43,550 --> 00:42:50,780
readme files inside of it<font color="#E5E5E5"> so open that</font>

824
00:42:47,030 --> 00:42:53,270
up<font color="#E5E5E5"> and there's the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> examiner readme file</font>

828
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:20,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">enough of that right</font>

00:43:40,859 --> 00:43:45,390
it's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a golden age of</font>

837
00:43:42,780 --> 00:43:47,670
peer-to-peer systems<font color="#CCCCCC"> and so and there's</font>

838
00:43:45,390 --> 00:43:50,520
so many other great<font color="#E5E5E5"> systems in this</font>

839
00:43:47,670 --> 00:43:53,730
space<font color="#E5E5E5"> and and if you want to get</font>

840
00:43:50,520 --> 00:43:55,050
involved and you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> tell a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> friend who</font>

841
00:43:53,730 --> 00:43:56,579
might be interested

842
00:43:55,050 --> 00:43:58,440
try using it you can just get it from

843
00:43:56,579 --> 00:44:00,930
github and you should be able to get

844
00:43:58,440 --> 00:44:03,720
those files<font color="#E5E5E5"> and and of course</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm sure</font>

845
00:44:00,930 --> 00:44:09,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">you'll find a bug so feel free to report</font>

846
00:44:03,720 --> 00:44:13,379
that and and also of course<font color="#E5E5E5"> share some</font>

847
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:16,109
files right and are you good at

marketing<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm not good at marketing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font>

849
00:44:16,109 --> 00:44:20,700
if you are maybe you can help me get

850
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:22,589
people excited about the system and<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

of<font color="#E5E5E5"> course there's a plenty of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> code to</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">write</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so if you like programming</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> there's</font>

853
00:44:24,869 --> 00:44:30,869
a bunch of really cool<font color="#E5E5E5"> problems that</font>

854

that need to be solved<font color="#E5E5E5"> and if you're a</font>

person who's worked on peer-to-peer

00:44:32,579 --> 00:44:39,060
systems before<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'd love to hear what</font>

857
00:44:35,130 --> 00:44:43,319
<font color="#E5E5E5">kind of advice you have and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so and so</font>

working<font color="#E5E5E5"> on this project and and you know</font>

861
00:44:49,349 --> 00:44:53,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">i hope you liked this talk even if you</font>

862
00:44:51,240 --> 00:44:55,649
think my design is terrible

863
00:44:53,790 --> 00:44:57,720
maybe this encourages you to think that

864
00:44:55,650 --> 00:44:59,760
you can develop your own better

865
00:44:57,720 --> 00:45:02,250
peer-to-peer system and you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> they'll</font>

866
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:04,230
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> a great outcome</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and so finally</font>

00:45:02,250 --> 00:45:06,119
thanks to everybody who<font color="#E5E5E5"> like reviewed my</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">ok</font>

much money they spend now<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's to make</font>

money<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> out you're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> gonna ask people</font>

881
00:45:40,220 --> 00:45:46,348
to spend money to save data

882
00:45:44,369 --> 00:45:48,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">so the questions about technical</font>

883
00:45:46,349 --> 00:46:07,710
scalability or whether people are<font color="#CCCCCC"> going</font>

884
00:45:48,960 --> 00:46:09,569
<font color="#CCCCCC">to be willing to spend money so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

885
00:46:07,710 --> 00:46:11,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">question is will people be willing to</font>

886
00:46:09,569 --> 00:46:14,249
sign up for identities<font color="#CCCCCC"> one</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> interesting</font>

887
00:46:11,970 --> 00:46:16,799
thing you can do is say there's no

888
00:46:14,249 --> 00:46:19,950
minimum price on an identity or set the

889
00:46:16,799 --> 00:46:22,559
minimum price to you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> cent</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

890
00:46:19,950 --> 00:46:25,649
then also allow people to buy identities

891
00:46:22,559 --> 00:46:27,690
that have a bigger say in the system so

892
00:46:25,650 --> 00:46:32,609
you can buy an identity that has a

893
00:46:27,690 --> 00:46:36,359
basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> more weight and then there's</font>

894
00:46:32,609 --> 00:46:40,109
also like<font color="#E5E5E5"> code scalability issues which</font>

895
00:46:36,359 --> 00:46:42,240
are you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> compression shorter naming</font>

896
00:46:40,109 --> 00:46:46,049
<font color="#CCCCCC">are both interesting things that you</font>

897
00:46:42,240 --> 00:46:54,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">could use to solve the as the index</font>

898
00:46:46,049 --> 00:47:06,430
grows very large<font color="#E5E5E5"> over</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> their shoes</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> more</font>

899
00:46:54,390 --> 00:47:14,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">expensive</font>

900
00:47:06,430 --> 00:47:19,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">and also</font>

901
00:47:14,370 --> 00:47:22,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">you're saying</font>

902
00:47:19,490 --> 00:47:25,129
yeah so the comment was<font color="#E5E5E5"> two things will</font>

903
00:47:22,520 --> 00:47:28,430
make<font color="#E5E5E5"> storage more expensive</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> bitcoins</font>

904
00:47:25,130 --> 00:47:32,119
getting more expensive and also as more

905
00:47:28,430 --> 00:47:35,569
people join the network<font color="#E5E5E5"> people wall</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

906
00:47:32,119 --> 00:47:41,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">it will take more money to store files</font>

907
00:47:35,570 --> 00:47:43,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">i'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not i guess necessarily convinced</font>

908
00:47:41,480 --> 00:47:46,970
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> neither of those things will happen</font>

909
00:47:43,400 --> 00:47:52,280
it's possible that bitcoin is correctly

910
00:47:46,970 --> 00:48:03,290
priced<font color="#CCCCCC"> now</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't necessarily think</font>

911
00:47:52,280 --> 00:48:04,880
that in the future people will<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm not</font>

912
00:48:03,290 --> 00:48:07,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">sure if there will be a snowball effect</font>

913
00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:16,820
or not it's definitely possible<font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

914
00:48:07,100 --> 00:48:19,190
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you have to see</font>

915
00:48:16,820 --> 00:48:20,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">I don't quite understand that but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

916
00:48:19,190 --> 00:48:22,580
would like<font color="#E5E5E5"> to maybe we could talk</font>

917
00:48:20,840 --> 00:48:24,530
afterwards<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'd like to understand more</font>

918
00:48:22,580 --> 00:48:27,890
about the economics of that

919
00:48:24,530 --> 00:48:30,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">yeah oh sorry you intercepted that guy</font>

920
00:48:27,890 --> 00:48:32,450
behind you<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're talking about resource</font>

921
00:48:30,320 --> 00:48:34,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">bird to eliminate people firing multiple</font>

922
00:48:32,450 --> 00:48:35,509
identities

923
00:48:34,040 --> 00:48:38,150
what's the difference between having

924
00:48:35,510 --> 00:48:40,700
multiple identities<font color="#E5E5E5"> one identity system</font>

925
00:48:38,150 --> 00:48:45,780
seems like<font color="#CCCCCC"> you restore</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ball</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font>

927
00:48:45,780 --> 00:48:50,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">explain</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> or say</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> system that's that's a</font>

928
00:48:48,780 --> 00:48:52,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">good point so the question is why is it</font>

929
00:48:50,670 --> 00:48:55,230
better to have multiple identities why

930
00:48:52,680 --> 00:48:59,220
would you want that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the way</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i would just</font>

931
00:48:55,230 --> 00:49:01,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">answer that is basically each a simple</font>

932
00:48:59,220 --> 00:49:04,709
way to think about it is<font color="#E5E5E5"> each identity</font>

933
00:49:01,650 --> 00:49:06,720
would have some fixed number of entries

934
00:49:04,710 --> 00:49:09,990
that they could publish into the index<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

935
00:49:06,720 --> 00:49:13,080
didn't explain that clearly but<font color="#E5E5E5"> so maybe</font>

936
00:49:09,990 --> 00:49:15,240
each identity gets to publish<font color="#E5E5E5"> 10,000</font>

937
00:49:13,080 --> 00:49:17,700
entries into the metadata index<font color="#E5E5E5"> so the</font>

938
00:49:15,240 --> 00:49:20,910
more<font color="#CCCCCC"> identities hat you have the more</font>

939
00:49:17,700 --> 00:49:25,259
influence you have over the content in

940
00:49:20,910 --> 00:49:26,940
the network and up here<font color="#CCCCCC"> main problem is</font>

941
00:49:25,260 --> 00:49:28,950
that a rich adversary can perform a

942
00:49:26,940 --> 00:49:29,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">cyclist actor easily and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> span the</font>

943
00:49:28,950 --> 00:49:31,140
network

944
00:49:29,730 --> 00:49:34,140
have you thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> of adding any sort of</font>

945
00:49:31,140 --> 00:49:35,580
like web<font color="#E5E5E5"> press model to kind of get</font>

946
00:49:34,140 --> 00:49:40,589
around that

947
00:49:35,580 --> 00:49:42,779
<font color="#CCCCCC">alright yeah</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so the question</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is rich</font>

948
00:49:40,590 --> 00:49:45,300
people can mess up the network<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's</font>

949
00:49:42,780 --> 00:49:47,460
completely true<font color="#CCCCCC"> up</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I thought</font>

950
00:49:45,300 --> 00:49:49,560
about adding a web of trust model yes

951
00:49:47,460 --> 00:49:51,180
so that's one of the things<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'd love to</font>

952
00:49:49,560 --> 00:49:54,120
add down the line<font color="#CCCCCC"> there's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> something</font>

953
00:49:51,180 --> 00:49:56,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">there's an algorithm called</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I can trust</font>

954
00:49:54,120 --> 00:50:00,870
that's a lot like kind of<font color="#CCCCCC"> page rank for</font>

955
00:49:56,850 --> 00:50:04,200
trust relationships and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hoping at</font>

956
00:50:00,870 --> 00:50:07,290
some point to be able to implement that

957
00:50:04,200 --> 00:50:10,379
and that would dissuade one bad actor

958
00:50:07,290 --> 00:50:12,420
from messing up the network<font color="#E5E5E5"> because you</font>

959
00:50:10,380 --> 00:50:15,720
can sort of have the entire community

960
00:50:12,420 --> 00:50:20,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">vote against one person</font>

961
00:50:15,720 --> 00:50:22,439
<font color="#CCCCCC">alright i love to hear more about what</font>

962
00:50:20,280 --> 00:50:23,460
you guys have to say so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i guess</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i'll be</font>

963
00:50:22,440 --> 00:50:25,820
out there

964
00:50:23,460 --> 00:50:36,369

965
00:50:25,820 --> 00:50:36,369
