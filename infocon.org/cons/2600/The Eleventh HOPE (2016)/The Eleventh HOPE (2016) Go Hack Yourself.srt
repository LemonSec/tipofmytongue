57
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:39,220
stuff you know some people they think

64
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:53,200
those things

65
00:02:49,390 --> 00:02:56,500
um except for the yoga fire<font color="#E5E5E5"> but it's</font>

68
00:02:59,530 --> 00:03:06,400
that you see in mainstream media<font color="#CCCCCC"> imagine</font>

69
00:03:01,990 --> 00:03:08,860
that and more about how you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> how you</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">I call it ancient</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> science</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> uh</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it actually</font>

73
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:19,270
is a science right so part of it is sort

74
00:03:17,650 --> 00:03:22,930
of religious there's a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> Hinduism</font>

75
00:03:19,270 --> 00:03:25,390
in in yoga<font color="#E5E5E5"> but you can you can kind of</font>

76
00:03:22,930 --> 00:03:27,370
leave out a lot of the mythology and a

77
00:03:25,390 --> 00:03:30,549
lot of the sort of<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of stuff that's</font>

78
00:03:27,370 --> 00:03:32,830
really weird<font color="#E5E5E5"> for a lot of people and you</font>

79
00:03:30,550 --> 00:03:35,020
can really focus on the very practical

80
00:03:32,830 --> 00:03:36,940
aspects of it and and really make a lot

81
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:38,980
of change<font color="#E5E5E5"> right you don't have to adopt</font>

82
00:03:36,940 --> 00:03:43,270
a new religion<font color="#CCCCCC"> you don't have to adopt</font>

83
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:45,489
any religion<font color="#E5E5E5"> but you can practice yoga</font>

84
00:03:43,270 --> 00:03:48,640
including<font color="#E5E5E5"> meditation and breathing</font>

85
00:03:45,490 --> 00:03:49,660
exercises and physical exercises and see

86
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:54,940
great results

87
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:56,109
alright alright so focus and

88
00:03:54,940 --> 00:04:00,579
concentration

89
00:03:56,110 --> 00:04:02,020
it's something that our minds can do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

90
00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:05,350
may have had moments where you can

91
00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:08,050
concentrate and actually do some really

92
00:04:05,350 --> 00:04:10,720
cool things<font color="#E5E5E5"> are you may have had times</font>

93
00:04:08,050 --> 00:04:13,330
where you needed to concentrate<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you</font>

94
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:16,899
found that you could not concentrate

95
00:04:13,330 --> 00:04:19,000
maybe if you're taking a test and you're

96
00:04:16,899 --> 00:04:22,150
thinking like<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> way</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i know i studied</font>

97
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:24,729
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> but your mind just goes blank</font>

98
00:04:22,150 --> 00:04:25,130
maybe you're giving a presentation in

99
00:04:24,729 --> 00:04:26,719
front

100
00:04:25,130 --> 00:04:28,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">of a bunch of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sunday morning</font>

101
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:29,510
and you forget everything that you're

102
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:31,789
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> send i'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to forget</font>

103
00:04:29,510 --> 00:04:34,340
everything<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to say but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the the</font>

104
00:04:31,790 --> 00:04:36,170
thing is like focus and concentration is

105
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:37,429
something that's really special about

106
00:04:36,170 --> 00:04:39,200
our minds

107
00:04:37,430 --> 00:04:41,810
I'm not sure that other animals can do

108
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:43,370
it we can see like like some monkeys and

109
00:04:41,810 --> 00:04:45,530
stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can kind of work with tools</font>

110
00:04:43,370 --> 00:04:47,090
and they have these looks on their faces

111
00:04:45,530 --> 00:04:48,260
that looks like they're concentrating

112
00:04:47,090 --> 00:04:50,479
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> kind of looks like they're thinking</font>

113
00:04:48,260 --> 00:04:52,159
really hard but it's something really

114
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:54,410
special about humans that we can

115
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:56,540
concentrate and if we put our minds to

116
00:04:54,410 --> 00:04:59,600
something we can do some pretty cool

117
00:04:56,540 --> 00:05:01,040
stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we're all hackers here so</font>

118
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:02,870
if you think about some of the coolest

119
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:05,660
things that you've ever done<font color="#E5E5E5"> some of the</font>

120
00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:06,590
coolest things you've ever made<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

121
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:09,560
wouldn't be able to do that without

122
00:05:06,590 --> 00:05:13,820
concentration<font color="#E5E5E5"> right um</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> but it seems like</font>

123
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:16,010
now<font color="#E5E5E5"> concentration like it's it's so hard</font>

124
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:18,980
for a lot of people and more people you

125
00:05:16,010 --> 00:05:21,289
talk to the more you find that it's very

126
00:05:18,980 --> 00:05:23,750
common for people to say things like oh

127
00:05:21,290 --> 00:05:25,070
yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> we'll</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have ADHD</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you know whether or</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">everything</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> has to come in bite-sized</font>

139
00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:51,920
chunks<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know because people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can't pay</font>

140
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:55,730
attention and it's become sort of the

00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:57,980
norm<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think that that's great</font>

to concentrate<font color="#CCCCCC"> i understand that there's</font>

144
00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:03,830
a lot of external factors and internal

145
00:06:02,270 --> 00:06:07,250
factors that make it difficult to

146
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:09,169
concentrate<font color="#CCCCCC"> but i think that as a norm</font>

147
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:11,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> something that we can do better and</font>

148
00:06:09,170 --> 00:06:13,190
we don't have to accept that just

149
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:15,650
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> no one can concentrate because</font>

150
00:06:13,190 --> 00:06:17,630
of all these different things that that

151
00:06:15,650 --> 00:06:19,669
it's okay that we shouldn't try to work

152
00:06:17,630 --> 00:06:21,350
on our powers of concentration<font color="#E5E5E5"> because</font>

153
00:06:19,670 --> 00:06:22,640
we really can do amazing things if we

154
00:06:21,350 --> 00:06:27,170
put our minds to it

155
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:31,010
<font color="#CCCCCC">alright so it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> actually pretty simple</font>

that he saw around him and he put them

together into something called<font color="#E5E5E5"> yoga</font>

sutures and that's what it looks like in

205

the original script but the<font color="#E5E5E5"> you don't</font>

302
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:09,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">accounting ok</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you can try this with your</font>

303
00:13:06,940 --> 00:13:10,900
eyes closed<font color="#E5E5E5"> for some folks when your</font>

304
00:13:09,310 --> 00:13:12,219
eyes are closed you start to<font color="#CCCCCC"> seize</font>

305
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:13,510
different stuff

306
00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:17,200
depending on what drugs<font color="#E5E5E5"> you've taken</font>

307
00:13:13,510 --> 00:13:19,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">that time and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going on but the you</font>

308
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:21,790
can also try this with your eyes open if

309
00:13:19,030 --> 00:13:23,650
you have like a blank wall<font color="#E5E5E5"> the this is</font>

310
00:13:21,790 --> 00:13:26,199
written up in some places<font color="#CCCCCC"> a blank wall</font>

311
00:13:23,650 --> 00:13:28,510
staring exercise and that's sort of a

312
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:30,160
next step if you can get it with your

313
00:13:28,510 --> 00:13:31,810
eyes closed and you can try it with your

314
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:33,550
eyes open and staring at a blank wall

315
00:13:31,810 --> 00:13:36,339
<font color="#CCCCCC">you don't want to stare at something</font>

316
00:13:33,550 --> 00:13:38,020
that has a contour or detail because

317
00:13:36,340 --> 00:13:39,880
you're going to start to look at only

318
00:13:38,020 --> 00:13:41,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">there's cracks in the wall and what's</font>

319
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:44,740
that thing there<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> gonna get you'll</font>

320
00:13:41,770 --> 00:13:47,199
find yourself easily distracted<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay but</font>

321
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:49,600
it's a good exercise to practice to just

322
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:53,170
calm yourself down<font color="#CCCCCC"> even if you just take</font>

323
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:54,760
60 seconds or even 30 seconds<font color="#CCCCCC"> but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if you</font>

324
00:13:53,170 --> 00:13:57,520
can start with 30 seconds and work

325
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:59,050
yourself up to<font color="#E5E5E5"> five minutes</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> take</font>

326
00:13:57,520 --> 00:13:59,860
five minutes a day and you work on this

327
00:13:59,050 --> 00:14:01,390
you're going to start to see

328
00:13:59,860 --> 00:14:03,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">improvements are going to want to try 10</font>

329
00:14:01,390 --> 00:14:05,140
minutes<font color="#CCCCCC"> alright and you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't have to</font>

330
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:06,580
just count you can you can you can just

331
00:14:05,140 --> 00:14:09,040
kind of think of something else<font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font>

332
00:14:06,580 --> 00:14:11,050
<font color="#CCCCCC">accounting kind of gets you there</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> right</font>

333
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:13,360
if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have trouble sleeping this is a</font>

334
00:14:11,050 --> 00:14:15,819
great exercise<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can imagine the sheep</font>

335
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:17,320
jumping over a fence or not<font color="#CCCCCC"> if you find</font>

336
00:14:15,820 --> 00:14:20,680
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> sheep are distracting you can just</font>

count<font color="#E5E5E5"> and focus on the counting</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ok this</font>

338
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:25,599
concentration exercise is<font color="#E5E5E5"> a weight as</font>

339
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:27,880
many at concentration exercises in yoga

340
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:30,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">but the idea is that you can't meditate</font>

341
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:32,500
without concentration so concentration

342
00:14:30,310 --> 00:14:34,839
comes before meditation and

343
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:38,200
concentration can help you<font color="#CCCCCC"> on and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot</font>

344
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:41,059

actually put yourself into your life and

388
00:16:13,789 --> 00:16:17,899
it's hard to think about it<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the big</font>

389
00:16:15,559 --> 00:16:19,848
picture but it's easy to think about

to be somebody else<font color="#E5E5E5"> you don't want to</font>

531
00:21:46,159 --> 00:21:49,850
end up in that kind of position you want

532
00:21:48,110 --> 00:21:53,600
to decide for yourself who you want to

533

who you want to be

535
00:21:55,460 --> 00:21:59,450
can you start to make a plan for

536
00:21:57,049 --> 00:22:01,850
yourself and you can use someone else's

537
00:21:59,450 --> 00:22:03,350
plan and adapt it to yourself or you can

538
00:22:01,850 --> 00:22:05,899
try to make up your own and kind of

539
00:22:03,350 --> 00:22:09,289
freestyle it<font color="#E5E5E5"> whatever works for you is</font>

00:22:09,289 --> 00:22:12,679
you're in this state that you don't fall

542
00:22:10,970 --> 00:22:14,780
prey to some people who are going to

part by part<font color="#E5E5E5"> it actually helps it</font>

00:43:48,700 --> 00:43:52,509
internal organs as well and you can

1092
00:43:50,049 --> 00:43:55,270
think you know my stomach is relaxing

1095
00:43:56,740 --> 00:44:01,720
eventually you just have to be relaxed

1096
00:43:59,349 --> 00:44:02,950
and just be that way<font color="#E5E5E5"> for as long as you</font>

1107
00:44:21,609 --> 00:44:26,348
<font color="#CCCCCC">that's important</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> because most of the</font>

relax while you're sleeping

1112

00:46:54,630 --> 00:46:58,069
going through something

1172
00:46:55,670 --> 00:47:01,670
and if you can kind of keep these

1173
00:46:58,069 --> 00:47:03,890
positive sort of feelings<font color="#CCCCCC"> you'll</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> find</font>

1174
00:47:01,670 --> 00:47:05,720
the interactions with anyone are<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font>

1175
00:47:03,890 --> 00:47:09,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">to it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> going to be better</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> right</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and you</font>

1176
00:47:05,720 --> 00:47:10,368
can think of it as<font color="#E5E5E5"> I love everyone but</font>

1177
00:47:09,020 --> 00:47:11,750
you don't have to like jump right

1178
00:47:10,369 --> 00:47:13,790
through that<font color="#E5E5E5"> could be a little extreme</font>

1179
00:47:11,750 --> 00:47:15,140
for people especially if you're more of

1180
00:47:13,790 --> 00:47:16,880
an introvert<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> want to</font>

1181
00:47:15,140 --> 00:47:19,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">love everyone that's crazy</font>

1182
00:47:16,880 --> 00:47:22,940
<font color="#CCCCCC">um but if you focus on yourself and you</font>

1183
00:47:19,670 --> 00:47:24,740
think like<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm trying to be my best self</font>

1184
00:47:22,940 --> 00:47:26,720
everyone should probably be trying to be

1185
00:47:24,740 --> 00:47:28,700
their best self<font color="#CCCCCC"> if I could be my best</font>

1186
00:47:26,720 --> 00:47:30,410
self maybe I can help people<font color="#CCCCCC"> maybe</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if</font>

1187
00:47:28,700 --> 00:47:32,598
people see me being my best self they

1188
00:47:30,410 --> 00:47:35,270
can be their best self and and it's sort

1189
00:47:32,599 --> 00:47:37,670
of like<font color="#CCCCCC"> spread</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it radiates from you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

1190
00:47:35,270 --> 00:47:40,460
in a sense that really is love<font color="#CCCCCC"> right and</font>

1191
00:47:37,670 --> 00:47:43,760
in a sense<font color="#CCCCCC"> i mean we really all</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are one</font>

1192
00:47:40,460 --> 00:47:45,319
kind of unit<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're stuck on this planet</font>

1193
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:48,470
we're all here if someone came from

1194
00:47:45,319 --> 00:47:50,058
another planet<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be like you're all</font>

1195
00:47:48,470 --> 00:47:51,558
pretty much the same like we<font color="#E5E5E5"> all see</font>

1196
00:47:50,059 --> 00:47:53,510
differences in each other but if an

1197
00:47:51,559 --> 00:47:54,680
alien came they see the similarities

1198
00:47:53,510 --> 00:47:57,530
more than they'd see the differences

1199
00:47:54,680 --> 00:47:59,540
right and so<font color="#E5E5E5"> that that'd be kind of like</font>

1200
00:47:57,530 --> 00:48:04,849
a way to tie that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I hope that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> answered a</font>

exercises<font color="#CCCCCC"> another</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> favorite of mine</font>

to say<font color="#E5E5E5"> candle gazing right so what you</font>

1225
00:49:00,570 --> 00:49:05,190
would do is you have a candle<font color="#CCCCCC"> where you</font>

1226
00:49:03,420 --> 00:49:06,690
can sort of see the flame not not a

1227
00:49:05,190 --> 00:49:08,490
candle that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> light cover where you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can</font>

1228
00:49:06,690 --> 00:49:11,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">see the flame and you try to get it to</font>

1229
00:49:08,490 --> 00:49:12,990
eye level so you<font color="#CCCCCC"> try</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to sit in a</font>

1230
00:49:11,130 --> 00:49:14,820
comfortable position you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

1231
00:49:12,990 --> 00:49:16,259
cross-legged position but if that hurts

1232
00:49:14,820 --> 00:49:17,970
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't it doesn't matter if you can</font>

1233
00:49:16,260 --> 00:49:20,310
sit comfortably<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you want to have the</font>

1234
00:49:17,970 --> 00:49:22,379
candle at eye level so that you don't

1235
00:49:20,310 --> 00:49:24,540
have to look up look down and<font color="#CCCCCC"> you just</font>

1236
00:49:22,380 --> 00:49:26,670
stare at the candle without blinking

1237
00:49:24,540 --> 00:49:28,170
<font color="#CCCCCC">ok for as long as you can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> now because</font>

really awesome powers but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean you</font>

1243
00:49:38,610 --> 00:49:41,490

1244
00:49:40,500 --> 00:49:43,380
mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> it didn't really work out that</font>

1245
00:49:41,490 --> 00:49:44,879
<font color="#E5E5E5">great from anyone yet</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> but ya handle</font>

1246
00:49:43,380 --> 00:49:46,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">gazing is a really good exercise to</font>

1247
00:49:44,880 --> 00:49:48,630
practice concentration<font color="#CCCCCC"> but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the thing is</font>

1248
00:49:46,560 --> 00:49:50,610
that you don't want to start like wow

1249
00:49:48,630 --> 00:49:52,470
look at that flame it's like<font color="#E5E5E5"> flickering</font>

1250
00:49:50,610 --> 00:49:54,510
and stuff and there's like this blue<font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font>

1251
00:49:52,470 --> 00:49:57,600
you just want to like focus on it<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

1252
00:49:54,510 --> 00:49:59,040
your eyes are going to water<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's good</font>

1253
00:49:57,600 --> 00:50:00,120
it's actually good for like cleaning

1254
00:49:59,040 --> 00:50:01,830
your eyes are right because your eyes

1255
00:50:00,120 --> 00:50:03,630
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> hey I want to blink you're like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> no</font>

1256
00:50:01,830 --> 00:50:06,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">not blinking nope</font>

1257
00:50:03,630 --> 00:50:06,780
and as you as you practice that longer

1258
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:08,160
and longer

1259
00:50:06,780 --> 00:50:09,960
that's another way that's like one other

1260
00:50:08,160 --> 00:50:13,109
exercise you can try<font color="#CCCCCC"> a slide from like</font>

1261
00:50:09,960 --> 00:50:15,540
the accounting<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay another thing you</font>

1262
00:50:13,110 --> 00:50:18,450
can do is you can find a mantra

1263
00:50:15,540 --> 00:50:20,759
<font color="#CCCCCC">ok now</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> mantras is another kind of topic</font>

1264
00:50:18,450 --> 00:50:21,509
where it sort of jumps off into stuff

1265
00:50:20,760 --> 00:50:23,430
that makes people feel uncomfortable

1266
00:50:21,510 --> 00:50:24,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> mantras involve</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> things</font>

1267
00:50:23,430 --> 00:50:28,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> hindu gods</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

1268
00:50:24,880 --> 00:50:30,730
hindu mythology but<font color="#E5E5E5"> you've heard of the</font>

1269
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:33,220
mantra own<font color="#E5E5E5"> home is a sacred syllable</font>

1270
00:50:30,730 --> 00:50:36,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">it's non-denominational right it</font>

00:50:33,220 --> 00:50:38,620
represents the sound of the universe

1272
00:50:36,220 --> 00:50:41,470
right if you if you look online you can

1273
00:50:38,620 --> 00:50:43,750
find people have recorded like<font color="#CCCCCC"> there's</font>

1274
00:50:41,470 --> 00:50:46,089
this home<font color="#CCCCCC"> there's this home that the</font>

1275

<font color="#E5E5E5">is kind of like to represent that home</font>

1277
00:50:48,340 --> 00:50:55,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">and if you can think own or say own as</font>

1278
00:50:54,070 --> 00:50:58,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">and breathe</font>

1279
00:50:55,690 --> 00:51:01,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's a really good mantra to start</font>

1280
00:50:58,030 --> 00:51:02,980
with and if you just think<font color="#E5E5E5"> home and not</font>

1281
00:51:01,330 --> 00:51:04,900
let anything else jump into your mind

1282
00:51:02,980 --> 00:51:07,360
and you concentrate on home

1283
00:51:04,900 --> 00:51:09,400
that's a good jumping point from<font color="#E5E5E5"> from</font>

1284
00:51:07,360 --> 00:51:12,220
the concentration<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> then</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> even go into</font>

you can use<font color="#CCCCCC"> you don't have to use only</font>

1287
00:51:13,780 --> 00:51:17,860
can find another mantra<font color="#CCCCCC"> but that's</font>

1288
00:51:16,060 --> 00:51:19,810
finding a mantra is kind of a journey<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

1289
00:51:17,860 --> 00:51:21,790
its own and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'll have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to leave that as</font>
