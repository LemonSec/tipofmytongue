<font color="#E5E5E5">thank you very much everybody who is</font>

2
00:00:08,429 --> 00:00:15,299
here tonight and thank you to the

3
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:16,529
organizers of hope for inviting me to

4
00:00:15,299 --> 00:00:21,359
talk about this

5
00:00:16,529 --> 00:00:22,800
the struggle<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I went through</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

6
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:25,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">National Security Letters has been going</font>

7
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:29,939
on for quite a long time it started in

8
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:32,579
2004 and one of my real fears was

9
00:00:29,939 --> 00:00:34,140
similar to something that Edward Snowden

10
00:00:32,579 --> 00:00:36,270
said that<font color="#E5E5E5"> that basically nobody would</font>

11
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:37,680
pay attention<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it was just sort of be</font>

12
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:39,059
a new story for a day and then it would

13
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:42,840
go away

14
00:00:39,059 --> 00:00:48,959
the amazing<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is that this story</font>

15
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:52,140
seems to endure and<font color="#CCCCCC"> continue and as time</font>

16
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:55,140
has gone on more and more organizations

17
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:58,469
have sort of jumped<font color="#CCCCCC"> on board and started</font>

18
00:00:55,140 --> 00:01:01,079
to push back against the government<font color="#CCCCCC"> but</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">before</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I get too deeply into that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> let me</font>

20
00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:08,610
give sort of an overview<font color="#CCCCCC"> the talk</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">sort of subtext is how they're supposed</font>

23
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:15,869
to be a system of checks and balances

24
00:01:12,869 --> 00:01:19,409
but they're not really strong enough<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

25
00:01:15,869 --> 00:01:24,390
in many cases including my experiences

provide a whole ton of information on

later on in the talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know I've been</font>

48
00:02:28,970 --> 00:02:40,579
sort of litigating this legal issue for

49
00:02:34,130 --> 00:02:44,960
a little around 12 years and it's been a

50

super long process and<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's sort</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

be able to like stand here and and tell

53
00:02:50,570 --> 00:02:56,090
the story without fear of getting in

54
00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:59,570
trouble for saying something that the

55
00:02:56,090 --> 00:03:02,570
government doesn't want me to say<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

56
00:02:59,570 --> 00:03:04,940
really nice thing is that as of a few

57
00:03:02,570 --> 00:03:06,410
months ago<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm able to really speak</font>

58
00:03:04,940 --> 00:03:09,950
completely fully about this issue

59
00:03:06,410 --> 00:03:12,829
without any kind of fear

60
00:03:09,950 --> 00:03:17,269
other than the normal paranoia that we

61
00:03:12,830 --> 00:03:20,060
all might have<font color="#CCCCCC"> what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really happened was</font>

62
00:03:17,270 --> 00:03:23,900
that there was a person who<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a client</font>

63
00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:26,180
of my internet provider who actually had

64
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:32,540
nothing but a shell account on a unix

65
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:37,640
server and that person was politically

66
00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:40,429
active and they were involved in trying

67
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:43,070
to reform the government and trying to

68
00:03:40,430 --> 00:03:47,990
reform in particular the correctional

69
00:03:43,070 --> 00:03:50,030
system and often the people that my

70
00:03:47,990 --> 00:03:52,160
company worked with<font color="#E5E5E5"> were</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> were doing</font>

71
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:54,890
political self and I sought out people

72
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:57,530
like that and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> took pride and I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

73
00:03:54,890 --> 00:03:59,720
took pleasure in helping out people who

74
00:03:57,530 --> 00:04:03,830
were doing work that<font color="#E5E5E5"> seemed important to</font>

75
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:05,120
me<font color="#CCCCCC"> i was only able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to sort of piece</font>

76
00:04:03,830 --> 00:04:07,580
together this whole story over the

77
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:09,620
course of several years but<font color="#CCCCCC"> what I began</font>

78
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:12,080
to understand was that the FBI

79
00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:13,520
approached this person who is my

80
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:16,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">company's client and they tried to</font>

81
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:19,430
enlist them to become an informant

82
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:21,738
within<font color="#E5E5E5"> their activist community and</font>

83
00:04:19,430 --> 00:04:27,319
within their social community

84
00:04:21,738 --> 00:04:29,508
and this person being not<font color="#CCCCCC"> the not the</font>

85
00:04:27,319 --> 00:04:32,900
type of person who is easily pushed

86
00:04:29,509 --> 00:04:35,810
around<font color="#E5E5E5"> refused to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to get involved in</font>

87
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:38,448
that type of activity and<font color="#E5E5E5"> declined to</font>

88
00:04:35,810 --> 00:04:45,020
become an informant<font color="#CCCCCC"> but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that apparently</font>

89
00:04:38,449 --> 00:04:47,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">made the FBI very upset and they began</font>

90
00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:52,669
to try to use<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of increasing level</font>

91
00:04:47,930 --> 00:04:57,289
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> uh of hostile techniques to try to</font>

92
00:04:52,669 --> 00:05:03,740
elicit<font color="#E5E5E5"> cooperation from this individual</font>

93
00:04:57,289 --> 00:05:05,659
and it ranged from<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know things like</font>

94
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:07,789
putting national security letters on

95
00:05:05,659 --> 00:05:09,229
them<font color="#CCCCCC"> together records on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on everyone</font>

96
00:05:07,789 --> 00:05:14,990
that they were communicating with<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

97
00:05:09,229 --> 00:05:16,849
visiting all<font color="#CCCCCC"> their prospective places of</font>

98
00:05:14,990 --> 00:05:19,909
employment<font color="#CCCCCC"> like sending out a couple of</font>

99
00:05:16,849 --> 00:05:21,380
agents to talk to them and say hey you

100
00:05:19,909 --> 00:05:24,080
know what do you really know about this

101
00:05:21,380 --> 00:05:26,300
person and making like kind of vague

102
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:28,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">asking big questions like that that that</font>

103
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:33,919
would freak out<font color="#E5E5E5"> potential employers and</font>

104
00:05:28,430 --> 00:05:40,039
sort of causing his professional life to

105
00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:43,219
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> more</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> less undermined to things like</font>

106
00:05:40,039 --> 00:05:45,560
putting him on the no-fly list and

107
00:05:43,219 --> 00:05:51,349
preventing him from<font color="#E5E5E5"> from traveling</font>

108
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:53,780
you know I<font color="#CCCCCC"> i ended up finding out a lot</font>

109
00:05:51,349 --> 00:05:56,990
about this in part from<font color="#E5E5E5"> from court</font>

110
00:05:53,780 --> 00:06:01,099
papers that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is all over</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the years where</font>

111
00:05:56,990 --> 00:06:02,389
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> FBI talked about you know things</font>

112
00:06:01,099 --> 00:06:05,509
that they had done and also just from

113
00:06:02,389 --> 00:06:06,590
talking to the person who it was it was

114
00:06:05,509 --> 00:06:10,460
awkward<font color="#E5E5E5"> and uncomfortable but I</font>

115
00:06:06,590 --> 00:06:11,989
maintained<font color="#E5E5E5"> like a relationship</font>

116
00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:13,280
communicating over instant messaging

117
00:06:11,990 --> 00:06:15,199
with this person throughout the entire

118
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:18,080
12 years but without ever telling them

119
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:21,050
what was going on because<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i wasn't</font>

120
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:23,270
able to but sometimes he would tell me

121
00:06:21,050 --> 00:06:25,400
you know stuff that was going on so I

122
00:06:23,270 --> 00:06:29,389
was able to like piece together what was

123
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:31,520
happening<font color="#CCCCCC"> I really strongly felt when</font>

124
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:33,070
when<font color="#CCCCCC"> i received this letter that that</font>

125
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:35,080
there<font color="#CCCCCC"> was no</font>

126
00:06:33,070 --> 00:06:36,219
<font color="#E5E5E5">that this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> was not a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bad person and that</font>

127
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:37,599
if the government really thought that

128
00:06:36,220 --> 00:06:39,070
they were up to something bad that they

129
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:43,000
could get a real warrant from a judge

130
00:06:39,070 --> 00:06:47,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">but the government always</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> refused</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to do</font>

131
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:51,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">that and I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I on some level</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm happy</font>

132
00:06:47,830 --> 00:06:54,340
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they didn't because it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> had let this</font>

133

issue come to the forefront<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the other</font>

00:06:56,590 --> 00:07:05,049

the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Constitution</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are speaking</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about the</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">Constitution you know for me really the</font>

138
00:07:07,630 --> 00:07:13,150
the central issue about national

139
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:16,480
security letters is the fact that using

thought that that would the<font color="#E5E5E5"> path would</font>

here and ending in the upper right

everything<font color="#E5E5E5"> he could to sort of undercut</font>

00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:12,810
withdraw the letter itself which sort of

the case for a number of years after

that<font color="#E5E5E5"> because for me it was really</font>

though that they didn't do in terms of

443
00:21:39,350 --> 00:21:43,340
reduction was they left all the bullet

444
00:21:41,180 --> 00:21:45,740
points there<font color="#CCCCCC"> and so a lot of people are</font>

able to<font color="#CCCCCC"> took a lot from it that other 16</font>

446

categories of information and so<font color="#CCCCCC"> they</font>

447
00:21:47,570 --> 00:21:52,820
interested<font color="#E5E5E5"> more about it in the third</font>

00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:55,460
stage<font color="#E5E5E5"> more of the information became</font>

449
00:21:52,820 --> 00:21:57,379
unredacted<font color="#CCCCCC"> and in the final stage which</font>

450
00:21:55,460 --> 00:22:00,440
is where we<font color="#CCCCCC"> arrived</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this past winter</font>

452
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:05,000

453
00:22:03,290 --> 00:22:07,490
funny because some of the information in

454
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:08,810
there is so outdated like if I'm sure

455
00:22:07,490 --> 00:22:10,160
there are other kind of sysadmin<font color="#E5E5E5"> tech</font>

456
00:22:08,810 --> 00:22:12,500
people in there but it was asking for

00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:14,930
radius logs and<font color="#CCCCCC"> just really ancient</font>

458
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:16,970
stuff it and it didn't even exist then

459
00:22:14,930 --> 00:22:21,680
you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> like I didn't have it then but</font>

460
00:22:16,970 --> 00:22:23,870
but but what kind of a interesting about

461
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:26,390
it is that the last category that they

462
00:22:23,870 --> 00:22:29,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">ask for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> their is this line where they</font>

465
00:22:31,670 --> 00:22:36,950
it sort of becomes relevant to stuff

466
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:41,060
that's going on<font color="#CCCCCC"> like right</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> now in 2016</font>

you go back and remember in an earlier

implicit admission that they were not

507
00:24:24,590 --> 00:24:29,990

you don't ever get like this complete

695
00:33:35,370 --> 00:33:40,350

encouraging<font color="#E5E5E5"> but I'm a technical person</font>

litigation and legislation<font color="#CCCCCC"> sometimes</font>

718

leave me a bit frustrated because they

00:34:53,989 --> 00:35:03,049
seem a bit murky<font color="#CCCCCC"> one of the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> things that</font>

720
00:34:58,940 --> 00:35:06,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">I came to realize a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> certain a certain</font>

721
00:35:03,050 --> 00:35:12,890
way into this process was that technical

00:35:06,740 --> 00:35:15,290
people like us should be designing<font color="#E5E5E5"> their</font>

products<font color="#E5E5E5"> that they they don't have this</font>

metadata in the first place<font color="#E5E5E5"> and they</font>

725
00:35:18,380 --> 00:35:24,500
really should be you know integrating

00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:31,250
not too much work for them because one

729
00:35:29,060 --> 00:35:33,320
thing that I've learned is that if if

730
00:35:31,250 --> 00:35:35,840
people have to click one time on<font color="#E5E5E5"> on a</font>

understand how how little it takes to

dissuade people from doing work to make

735
00:35:46,610 --> 00:35:54,620
their communications more secure the

748
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:23,060

against national security letters in the

federal court system out on the west

751

coast and there's been some really

752
00:36:28,970 --> 00:36:34,939
positive movement in a way that wasn't

753

going on in<font color="#E5E5E5"> 2004 when I began this whole</font>

now it seems like

756
00:36:39,070 --> 00:36:44,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">that the the general consensus in the</font>

tech industry is that the government<font color="#E5E5E5"> has</font>

758
00:36:44,110 --> 00:36:53,650
kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> gone too far and that it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

759
00:36:45,850 --> 00:36:57,190
to sort of push back the<font color="#E5E5E5"> roles of</font>

litigation legislation<font color="#E5E5E5"> and and and</font>

761
00:36:57,190 --> 00:37:05,650
technical approaches are things that are

00:37:01,180 --> 00:37:08,830
complementary and despite that<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

763
00:37:05,650 --> 00:37:11,170
personally have a stronger affinity for

the technical<font color="#E5E5E5"> rather than the litigated</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">or legislative</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm not really willing to</font>

give up on any of them<font color="#CCCCCC"> thus far and I</font>

767
00:37:16,270 --> 00:37:22,300
feel like if we're going to make

768
00:37:19,030 --> 00:37:24,190
progress against this type of government

are and that that we are that I think we

771
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:31,210
have to use all the tools at our

772
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:38,710
disposal<font color="#CCCCCC"> so all three of those</font>

774
00:37:38,710 --> 00:37:41,860
did feel really lonely at the beginning

775
00:37:40,330 --> 00:37:45,490
of listening and really isolated because

776
00:37:41,860 --> 00:37:50,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">i couldn't talk to anyone about it and</font>

00:37:45,490 --> 00:37:53,859
now<font color="#CCCCCC"> i don't feel alone</font>

00:37:50,230 --> 00:37:57,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">I really do feel</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like that this has</font>

779
00:37:53,860 --> 00:37:58,390
become part of the consensus and that at

780
00:37:57,040 --> 00:38:01,690
the beginning what<font color="#CCCCCC"> I did seemed</font>

781

<font color="#CCCCCC">extremists and now seems like common</font>

782
00:38:01,690 --> 00:38:07,750
sense and so that in and of itself is a

783
00:38:04,930 --> 00:38:10,210
huge deal and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think i should thank</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

at least a<font color="#CCCCCC"> rubber stamp court that</font>

doesn't allow an adversarial discussion

question<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> first of all congratulations</font>

873
00:42:46,310 --> 00:42:48,950
for standing your ground on behalf of

874
00:42:47,930 --> 00:42:51,980
all of us

875
00:42:48,950 --> 00:42:56,000
thank you so much thank you it's really

876
00:42:51,980 --> 00:42:58,010
nice to do that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and secondly what can we</font>

877
00:42:56,000 --> 00:43:02,330
do to help you

878
00:42:58,010 --> 00:43:04,490
and thirdly if something that they

879
00:43:02,330 --> 00:43:08,029
obtained through an NSA actually went to

880
00:43:04,490 --> 00:43:09,680
court<font color="#E5E5E5"> is it even admissible because it</font>

881
00:43:08,030 --> 00:43:11,480
sounds like a fishing expedition to me

882
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:13,609
they could go after everything and just

883
00:43:11,480 --> 00:43:17,240
sit through it

884
00:43:13,610 --> 00:43:18,800
that's a good question<font color="#CCCCCC"> arm and i wish i</font>

885
00:43:17,240 --> 00:43:20,660
had a lawyer here on the panel with me

886
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:22,580
to address it because on some level it

887
00:43:20,660 --> 00:43:24,830
seems to me that what they would get

888
00:43:22,580 --> 00:43:26,900
evidence that they were obtained with an

889
00:43:24,830 --> 00:43:31,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">SL should be inadmissible</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> or</font>

890
00:43:26,900 --> 00:43:33,290
challengeable in court<font color="#E5E5E5"> but it seems like</font>

891
00:43:31,220 --> 00:43:34,759
<font color="#CCCCCC">court cases are being brought with</font>

892
00:43:33,290 --> 00:43:42,350
information that they obtained with<font color="#CCCCCC"> my</font>

00:43:34,760 --> 00:43:45,560
<font color="#CCCCCC">cells and I don't yeah</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> add</font>

894
00:43:42,350 --> 00:43:46,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">another notion</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that is one that is one</font>

895
00:43:45,560 --> 00:43:48,080
way they do<font color="#CCCCCC"> you have you heard about</font>

896
00:43:46,610 --> 00:43:50,660
that i mean that's essentially parallel

897
00:43:48,080 --> 00:43:52,940
construction is like<font color="#CCCCCC"> mmm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I've</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> heard</font>

898
00:43:50,660 --> 00:43:55,040
about that mainly in the context of NSA

899
00:43:52,940 --> 00:43:58,070
stuff<font color="#CCCCCC"> like the NSA</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> over here is all the</font>

900
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:59,840
conversations<font color="#E5E5E5"> they</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> hear so-and-so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

901
00:43:58,070 --> 00:44:01,190
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to meet so-and-so and they get</font>

902
00:43:59,840 --> 00:44:04,580
some evidence like that and then they

903
00:44:01,190 --> 00:44:06,710
essentially go<font color="#E5E5E5"> until</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Gea ok let's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> say</font>

904
00:44:04,580 --> 00:44:09,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">that some guy you met told you this</font>

905
00:44:06,710 --> 00:44:10,820
story<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so they come up with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> story</font>

906
00:44:09,350 --> 00:44:13,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">that they can tell in court that</font>

907
00:44:10,820 --> 00:44:15,650
actually passes muster<font color="#CCCCCC"> I don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't</font>

908
00:44:13,730 --> 00:44:17,240
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> that that's it gets into the</font>

909
00:44:15,650 --> 00:44:17,960
realm of speculation<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I really don't</font>

910
00:44:17,240 --> 00:44:20,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">know</font>

911

997
00:47:53,490 --> 00:47:56,368
at the beginning when<font color="#E5E5E5"> I first started</font>

998
00:47:54,690 --> 00:47:57,869
this whole thing the law<font color="#CCCCCC"> was so</font>

999
00:47:56,369 --> 00:47:59,490
incomplete

1000
00:47:57,869 --> 00:48:01,470
it was almost like<font color="#E5E5E5"> a rough draft that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

1001
00:47:59,490 --> 00:48:03,180
didn't say what the penalty was so just

1002
00:48:01,470 --> 00:48:04,770
left you in the dark just wondering like

1003
00:48:03,180 --> 00:48:08,160
well I'm sure it's gonna be something

1004
00:48:04,770 --> 00:48:09,570
bad but it doesn't say what<font color="#CCCCCC"> it is it's</font>

1005
00:48:08,160 --> 00:48:11,640
so my question<font color="#CCCCCC"> is sort</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of related to</font>

1006
00:48:09,570 --> 00:48:14,099
that but since these aren't supposed to

1007
00:48:11,640 --> 00:48:16,500
be able to go to court because you can't

1008
00:48:14,099 --> 00:48:19,200
talk to a court about them at how do

1009
00:48:16,500 --> 00:48:22,200
they enforce them at all like if you go

1010
00:48:19,200 --> 00:48:23,939
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> adjustments a these guys in suits</font>

1011
00:48:22,200 --> 00:48:27,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">handed me</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> document</font>

1012
00:48:23,940 --> 00:48:30,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">ah it seems wrong and they say wait wait</font>

1013
00:48:27,960 --> 00:48:31,740
you can't talk about this right<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're</font>

1014
00:48:30,720 --> 00:48:34,649
now in a court of law

1015
00:48:31,740 --> 00:48:39,089
right right<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah it is it is a bizarre</font>

1016
00:48:34,650 --> 00:48:40,410
kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> cough</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> gasps catch-22 and I think</font>

1017
00:48:39,089 --> 00:48:43,680
the bottom line is that the courts

1018
00:48:40,410 --> 00:48:45,390
didn't agree with the FBI<font color="#E5E5E5"> they have the</font>

1019
00:48:43,680 --> 00:48:46,830
FBI in the letter that<font color="#CCCCCC"> i got just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> said</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

1020
00:48:45,390 --> 00:48:48,270
could tell no person it didn't

1021
00:48:46,830 --> 00:48:50,819
specifically say you can't go to court

1022
00:48:48,270 --> 00:48:53,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">but I took that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i took that to mean what</font>

all lawyers and judges and everyone but

1027
00:49:00,210 --> 00:49:03,960
the court apparently really didn't agree

1028
00:49:02,160 --> 00:49:06,420
with that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and actually the judge that we</font>
