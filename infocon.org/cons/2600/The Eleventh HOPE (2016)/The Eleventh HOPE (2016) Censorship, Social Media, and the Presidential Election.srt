410
00:19:29,759 --> 00:19:36,029
you're making a couple of logical

411
00:19:32,070 --> 00:19:39,418
mistakes here in your analyses<font color="#E5E5E5"> one is</font>

412
00:19:36,029 --> 00:19:41,429
you're ignoring the echo chamber effect

00:20:56,099 --> 00:21:01,859
believe it's true for facebook as well

<font color="#E5E5E5">that these aren't as highly customized</font>

00:21:01,859 --> 00:21:20,899

yes the<font color="#CCCCCC"> newsfeeds very customized</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> well</font>

read the article and you know not get

462
00:22:26,660 --> 00:22:29,720
the money so of course they won't do

that<font color="#CCCCCC"> they do a very good job of</font>

differentiate what what is the the<font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">you're out your algorithm for</font>

00:22:38,870 --> 00:22:47,479
differentiating between a feed that is

471
00:22:53,060 --> 00:22:58,250
you know how can you differentiate

472
00:22:54,740 --> 00:23:01,820
between a feed that is customized

473
00:22:58,250 --> 00:23:05,990
according to some guidelines from above

<font color="#CCCCCC">vs feed that happens to shoot to appear</font>

475
00:23:05,990 --> 00:23:09,950
that way because of all your prior post

in history

477
00:23:09,950 --> 00:23:15,020
well we need to separate<font color="#CCCCCC"> news feed which</font>

533
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:42,709
interesting to you know like kind of

534
00:25:40,460 --> 00:25:44,390
figuring out in a decentralized way what

535
00:25:42,710 --> 00:25:46,909
is most interesting<font color="#CCCCCC"> come</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to show people</font>

536
00:25:44,390 --> 00:25:48,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">um</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I do kind of wonder how that how you</font>

537
00:25:46,909 --> 00:25:50,150
would defend against creating echo

538
00:25:48,530 --> 00:25:51,408
chambers are just little pods of people

539
00:25:50,150 --> 00:25:53,570
to share the same news amongst each

540
00:25:51,409 --> 00:25:54,530
other and kind of always<font color="#CCCCCC"> thinking that I</font>

541
00:25:53,570 --> 00:25:56,510
was<font color="#E5E5E5"> thinking you know there's a lot of</font>

542
00:25:54,530 --> 00:25:58,070
talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about how everyone getting</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> news</font>

00:25:56,510 --> 00:26:00,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">from a different source kind of like</font>

544
00:25:58,070 --> 00:26:01,939
<font color="#E5E5E5">helps to just make just many sizes just</font>

545
00:26:00,950 --> 00:26:04,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't want to talk to each other anymore</font>

546
00:26:01,940 --> 00:26:06,320
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> how like having fewer new sources</font>

547
00:26:04,220 --> 00:26:08,090
like everyone would watch one or two of

548
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:09,649
them and<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like more common</font>

549
00:26:08,090 --> 00:26:13,100
watching and so you would have less

550
00:26:09,650 --> 00:26:15,980
extreme is<font color="#CCCCCC"> divisiveness</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in kind of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> hold</font>

552
00:26:15,980 --> 00:26:20,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">a there's a kind of a part to play for</font>

553
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:23,120
these outlets to maybe show multiple

554
00:26:20,870 --> 00:26:24,830
like a diversity of things that may be

555
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:26,030
interesting<font color="#CCCCCC"> so they aren't just making</font>

559
00:26:31,460 --> 00:26:37,400
peer-to-peer model that would bypass the

560

echo chamber problem<font color="#CCCCCC"> yes quite</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> right</font>

00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:42,200
<font color="#CCCCCC">huh</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a really hard problem that's</font>

562
00:26:40,460 --> 00:26:43,909
like a human problem right

<font color="#CCCCCC">I think you solved that in a human way</font>

00:26:43,909 --> 00:26:50,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">uh I have a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of friends who have</font>

574
00:27:10,070 --> 00:27:14,689
at me for interacting with people who

575
00:27:12,020 --> 00:27:17,450
they think are wrong<font color="#CCCCCC"> so I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> actually</font>

576
00:27:14,690 --> 00:27:18,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">wanted to be sure to started out as</font>

00:27:17,450 --> 00:27:23,120
someone who was mentored by ethan

00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:26,570
thesis was that the internet is an echo

580
00:27:25,190 --> 00:27:30,350
chamber and we need to break out of that

581
00:27:26,570 --> 00:27:33,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">so like I came</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> into the internet with</font>

that mentality<font color="#CCCCCC"> being mentored by him and</font>

583
00:27:33,260 --> 00:27:39,110
now<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm becoming smaller</font>

584
00:27:35,450 --> 00:27:40,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">because of all the bad feedback that I'm</font>

585
00:27:39,110 --> 00:27:43,189
getting is<font color="#CCCCCC"> I actually engage with</font>

586
00:27:40,970 --> 00:27:45,350
diverse views and and I say that in a

587
00:27:43,190 --> 00:27:47,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">sheepish way I don't want to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I don't</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">but it's what's happening</font>

00:27:50,899 --> 00:27:55,850
sure<font color="#CCCCCC"> i started deleting posts on my</font>

592
00:27:53,899 --> 00:27:57,739
facebook last week for the first time

593
00:27:55,850 --> 00:28:01,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">kind of apologizing to people and</font>

594
00:27:57,740 --> 00:28:03,649
explaining why<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i think one first step</font>

595
00:28:01,730 --> 00:28:07,970
is for us to be nicer to each other

596
00:28:03,649 --> 00:28:10,850
sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> to agree to disagree yeah like if</font>

597
00:28:07,970 --> 00:28:13,490
we could agree to disagree<font color="#E5E5E5"> then it would</font>

598
00:28:10,850 --> 00:28:16,010
be a lot easier to free exchange

599
00:28:13,490 --> 00:28:18,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">um yeah</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I think the bottom line for me</font>

600
00:28:16,010 --> 00:28:21,440
is that's like<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> human</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> problem</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in a</font>

601
00:28:18,230 --> 00:28:23,690
kindness problem and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I like can we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

602
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:25,039
interested in<font color="#CCCCCC"> views beyond our own with</font>

603
00:28:23,690 --> 00:28:26,600
the humbleness that there's something to

00:28:25,039 --> 00:28:28,309
learn<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem</font>

605
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:29,510
sure that that's a really big<font color="#CCCCCC"> ass</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was</font>

606
00:28:28,309 --> 00:28:31,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">awesome and i love it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i think it should</font>

happen<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the meantime maybe do you</font>

608
00:28:31,340 --> 00:28:36,439
think it's possible for like Twitter and

609
00:28:33,049 --> 00:28:38,539
Facebook<font color="#CCCCCC"> um to use their kind of power</font>

610
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:40,580
that they have just by doing these feeds

611
00:28:38,539 --> 00:28:42,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">not feasible like the trending topics</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> um</font>

612
00:28:40,580 --> 00:28:43,879
<font color="#E5E5E5">to try</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and force</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that hand a little bit</font>

613
00:28:42,260 --> 00:28:46,010
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> you think they have the capacity to</font>

614
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:47,480
be more even-handed<font color="#CCCCCC"> i guess i'll just be</font>

615
00:28:46,010 --> 00:28:49,669
like the BBC or something like<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

616
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:51,529
power<font color="#E5E5E5"> is dry but it tends to be a little</font>

617
00:28:49,669 --> 00:28:53,600
more neutral<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think that Twitter and</font>

618
00:28:51,529 --> 00:28:54,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">Facebook just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have tremendous power</font>

right now

<font color="#E5E5E5">oh yeah and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's and part of what i came</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">away with as</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they did the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> research for</font>

much power<font color="#CCCCCC"> Twitter and Facebook and you</font>

getting us to take actions and for

00:29:11,630 --> 00:29:16,730
changing our lens on world events and

627
00:29:15,169 --> 00:29:18,200
that's what's frustrating to me about

628
00:29:16,730 --> 00:29:21,049
the notion that they're neutral<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're</font>

how they could use that for good<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think</font>

632
00:29:27,260 --> 00:29:31,429
<font color="#CCCCCC">the first step might be for them to kind</font>

of<font color="#CCCCCC"> acknowledge that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there are entities</font>

there's something wrong right there you

663
00:30:44,460 --> 00:30:47,519
<font color="#E5E5E5">need to take it back from these</font>

664
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:50,159
companies they have only as much power

665
00:30:47,519 --> 00:30:52,440
as we give to them and why you're giving

666
00:30:50,159 --> 00:30:55,379
these companies the power to mold your

667
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:59,820
political views is beyond me

668
00:30:55,379 --> 00:31:02,340

lesson<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think that's that was my</font>

670
00:31:02,340 --> 00:31:08,009
takeaway from<font color="#E5E5E5"> Snowden's revelations from</font>

671
00:31:04,649 --> 00:31:10,049
so many other moments where we've seen

672
00:31:08,009 --> 00:31:11,879
these companies aggregating data and

673
00:31:10,049 --> 00:31:14,279
becoming very powerful that's power that

674
00:31:11,879 --> 00:31:17,609
they only have that we give them<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's</font>

675
00:31:14,279 --> 00:31:21,059
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> very important point</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I i would argue</font>

676
00:31:17,609 --> 00:31:23,879
<font color="#E5E5E5">that it's my hope that companies will be</font>

677
00:31:21,059 --> 00:31:26,940
true to their word and it's my hope that

678
00:31:23,879 --> 00:31:29,219
companies will be true to the power and

679
00:31:26,940 --> 00:31:31,320
<font color="#CCCCCC">responsibility they have that's a very</font>

680
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:35,580
optimistic view they don't need to do

681
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:37,889
that but<font color="#E5E5E5"> we can call on them and and and</font>

682
00:31:35,580 --> 00:31:41,249
you know come together and say we think

683
00:31:37,889 --> 00:31:45,389
it matters where we can you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> I I</font>

684
00:31:41,249 --> 00:31:54,629
admire your stance

685
00:31:45,389 --> 00:31:58,589
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay thanks Sharky niña like anyway i'm</font>

686
00:31:54,629 --> 00:32:01,109
sitting<font color="#E5E5E5"> because I'm like actually that</font>

687
00:31:58,589 --> 00:32:02,458
the previous speaker actually had one of

688
00:32:01,109 --> 00:32:04,499
the things<font color="#CCCCCC"> I wanted to say</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about the</font>

689
00:32:02,459 --> 00:32:06,149
other thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> i want to say is i mean i</font>

690
00:32:04,499 --> 00:32:08,039
<font color="#CCCCCC">know a lot</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of people are suspicious of</font>

691
00:32:06,149 --> 00:32:09,629
government because you know you know

692
00:32:08,039 --> 00:32:11,820
don't you know they're all these<font color="#CCCCCC"> ones i</font>

693
00:32:09,629 --> 00:32:13,559
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go into why but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm just</font>

694
00:32:11,820 --> 00:32:15,269
thinking of that I think we should also

695
00:32:13,559 --> 00:32:17,190
be suspicious of private business

696
00:32:15,269 --> 00:32:19,320
because you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's that's what they</font>

697
00:32:17,190 --> 00:32:21,570
are and that<font color="#E5E5E5"> people are just way too</font>

698
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:23,519
trusting and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I don't I really don't</font>

699
00:32:21,570 --> 00:32:27,239
think it's reasonable to expect that

700
00:32:23,519 --> 00:32:28,469
these companies are going to you know be

701
00:32:27,239 --> 00:32:30,149
what we want them to be

702
00:32:28,469 --> 00:32:32,159
<font color="#CCCCCC">I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> mean we have to decide you know like</font>

703
00:32:30,149 --> 00:32:34,468
<font color="#E5E5E5">you said you know decide to engage or</font>

704
00:32:32,159 --> 00:32:36,929
not you know but with our eyes open

705
00:32:34,469 --> 00:32:39,299
<font color="#E5E5E5">they're in it to make money they can do</font>

706
00:32:36,929 --> 00:32:42,119
what they want and just you know that

707
00:32:39,299 --> 00:32:44,849
that's basically where is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're</font>

708
00:32:42,119 --> 00:32:47,399
in it to make money and in some cases<font color="#CCCCCC"> uh</font>

709
00:32:44,849 --> 00:32:50,189
<font color="#CCCCCC">I believe</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> technologist at these</font>

710
00:32:47,399 --> 00:32:52,859
companies come in either with like a

00:32:50,190 --> 00:32:55,679
genuinely<font color="#E5E5E5"> ethical point of view from</font>

00:32:52,859 --> 00:32:58,109
their point of view<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is it</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">it's what we can do about civilization i</font>

716
00:33:02,309 --> 00:33:06,178
guess<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's probably one of those core</font>

717
00:33:03,899 --> 00:33:08,428
value things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that people just do because</font>

718
00:33:06,179 --> 00:33:10,440
of who they are you know when and when

719
00:33:08,429 --> 00:33:13,169
you look at people running experiments

720
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:14,909
that's coming out of curiosity<font color="#E5E5E5"> but with</font>

721
00:33:13,169 --> 00:33:16,769
the so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we got experiment but the</font>

722
00:33:14,909 --> 00:33:19,049
thing is that it when it's when it's a

723
00:33:16,769 --> 00:33:20,489
private company doing experiments it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

724
00:33:19,049 --> 00:33:22,109
kind of a different but<font color="#CCCCCC"> I guess that's</font>

725
00:33:20,489 --> 00:33:23,759
<font color="#CCCCCC">the thing it isn't that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people know</font>

726
00:33:22,109 --> 00:33:25,889
about it now<font color="#CCCCCC"> I guess the only other</font>

727
00:33:23,759 --> 00:33:27,570
thing I would mention is back in the day

728
00:33:25,889 --> 00:33:29,879
when we used to have<font color="#E5E5E5"> like comment</font>

00:33:47,879 --> 00:33:52,260
it's an interesting question you

<font color="#CCCCCC">facebook</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> twitter to improve and I</font>

don't want to say it's too difficult<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

all that well<font color="#CCCCCC"> well you know it and I was</font>

955
00:42:55,070 --> 00:43:00,110
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was because I thought you could get</font>

new companies and new social networks

957
00:43:00,110 --> 00:43:04,670
off the ground and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i still</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> believe</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

958
00:43:01,730 --> 00:43:07,700
we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> it just it's a really big</font>

959
00:43:04,670 --> 00:43:12,170
endeavor you have to find some way to

960
00:43:07,700 --> 00:43:14,120
get so many people on it<font color="#E5E5E5"> right like if</font>

00:43:12,170 --> 00:43:16,640
you really<font color="#E5E5E5"> want it to take off and</font>

00:43:14,120 --> 00:43:20,420
<font color="#CCCCCC">sustained as a platform it has to be</font>

963
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:23,450
appealing to a wide group of people and

964
00:43:20,420 --> 00:43:27,170
that's tough<font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I think that we may get</font>

965
00:43:23,450 --> 00:43:28,640
<font color="#CCCCCC">their Google+ and how am</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> gonna do I i</font>

966
00:43:27,170 --> 00:43:31,460
think that's the challenge right because

967
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:34,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">I'm so many people here at Hope</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have the</font>

platforms<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the open source code to</font>

970
00:43:36,230 --> 00:43:41,090
build them that's already out there

971
00:43:38,390 --> 00:43:44,390
the tricky<font color="#CCCCCC"> pieces like how do we make it</font>

972
00:43:41,090 --> 00:43:46,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">stick so we can have something that's</font>

973
00:43:44,390 --> 00:43:49,009
more ours and and it's a really hard

974
00:43:46,670 --> 00:43:52,310
problem but i do think that we could get

975
00:43:49,010 --> 00:43:54,020
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know I really do and things</font>

thought would have happened<font color="#CCCCCC"> we can for</font>

979
00:43:56,870 --> 00:44:02,089
sure make a new social network<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm not</font>

980
00:43:58,490 --> 00:44:05,959
sure how<font color="#CCCCCC"> just yet but I think that's</font>

981
00:44:02,090 --> 00:44:08,570
absolutely a worthwhile topic for us to

982
00:44:05,960 --> 00:44:10,820
keep<font color="#CCCCCC"> noodling on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i have to believe</font>

983
00:44:08,570 --> 00:44:12,320
it's possible<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know I like to think</font>

984
00:44:10,820 --> 00:44:14,210
that the<font color="#CCCCCC"> future's going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to do you think</font>

00:45:19,869 --> 00:45:24,100
mess up in some way that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> won't</font>

because it didn't exist yet

1019
00:45:34,600 --> 00:45:43,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">and then it keeps going</font>

ever

1068
00:47:44,349 --> 00:47:47,499
yeah it was very much like you know

1069
00:47:45,609 --> 00:47:50,529
whatever<font color="#CCCCCC"> facebook did</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> last</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Tuesday</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> well</font>

1070
00:47:47,499 --> 00:47:52,359
that was perfect and that kind of didn't

1071
00:47:50,529 --> 00:47:53,619
seem to go along with how we have tech

1072
00:47:52,359 --> 00:47:55,509
companies now that you know they're

1073

doing a<font color="#CCCCCC"> be test their changing little</font>

that you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> easily</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to people that are</font>

generally more transparent and less

1090
00:48:32,380 --> 00:48:36,759
problematic people don't seem concerned

1091

about<font color="#CCCCCC"> what showing up in their feet</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">rowdy group of people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> already group</font>

of people good<font color="#CCCCCC"> good you're good company</font>

1111
00:49:27,230 --> 00:49:31,910
so are you looking for these companies

1112
00:49:29,150 --> 00:49:33,170
to be completely neutral or maybe it's

1113
00:49:31,910 --> 00:49:34,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">ok if they have a stance but they're</font>

1114
00:49:33,170 --> 00:49:37,250
just more transparent about what it is

1115
00:49:34,910 --> 00:49:39,828
oh well you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm coming out of</font>

1116
00:49:37,250 --> 00:49:42,020
having worked in more open source

1117
00:49:39,829 --> 00:49:44,300
software<font color="#CCCCCC"> or the last few years and I</font>

1118
00:49:42,020 --> 00:49:46,910
like transparency<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think that</font>

1119
00:49:44,300 --> 00:49:48,710
transparency is and it's a nice practice

1120
00:49:46,910 --> 00:49:50,420
<font color="#CCCCCC">you know you make mistakes but you're</font>

1121
00:49:48,710 --> 00:49:53,089
open about it and we can have

1122
00:49:50,420 --> 00:49:55,040
conversations about it as a community<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

1123
00:49:53,089 --> 00:49:57,980
that would be my preference<font color="#CCCCCC"> my</font>

1124
00:49:55,040 --> 00:50:00,259
preference would be for companies to

1125
00:49:57,980 --> 00:50:03,230
just admit that<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> imperfect and</font>

1126
00:50:00,260 --> 00:50:05,420
it's a process and solicit feedback and

1127
00:50:03,230 --> 00:50:07,400
for us to say yeah we'd rather have you

1128
00:50:05,420 --> 00:50:09,710
curate and we understand that humans are

1129
00:50:07,400 --> 00:50:11,210
messy and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> curations not perfect and</font>

1130
00:50:09,710 --> 00:50:14,089
for facebook to say something like

1131
00:50:11,210 --> 00:50:16,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">neutrality is a value but it's like we</font>

1132
00:50:14,089 --> 00:50:20,630
get as close as we can<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think something</font>

1133
00:50:16,940 --> 00:50:22,069
like that would probably<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'd probably</font>

1134
00:50:20,630 --> 00:50:25,069
<font color="#E5E5E5">like that a lot</font>

1135
00:50:22,069 --> 00:50:26,930
um<font color="#CCCCCC"> it'sit's the conflict between when a</font>

1136
00:50:25,069 --> 00:50:28,069
company says<font color="#CCCCCC"> a thing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and it's just know</font>

1137
00:50:26,930 --> 00:50:30,799
what they're doing that's what troubles

00:50:28,069 --> 00:50:32,300
me<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm also just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> troubled by the</font>

00:50:32,300 --> 00:50:37,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">an elections and because of the lack of</font>

00:50:37,310 --> 00:50:41,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">it's unlikely that Facebook or Twitter</font>

1143
00:50:39,440 --> 00:50:44,420
will swing the selection or certainly

1144
00:50:41,390 --> 00:50:47,598
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> they'll try</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but it remains true</font>

did I answer your question yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> also</font>

equally desirable for them to step in

and<font color="#CCCCCC"> say no we have an opinion on this</font>

1162
00:51:22,230 --> 00:51:25,349
selected to see them and then we get

1163
00:51:23,940 --> 00:51:27,570
into the question of whether<font color="#CCCCCC"> facebook</font>

1164
00:51:25,349 --> 00:51:32,460
should be hosting that content and

1165
00:51:27,570 --> 00:51:35,520
that's something that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm unsure about</font>

1166
00:51:32,460 --> 00:51:38,430
that's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> free-speech question that I'm</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">not Eddie's with yet myself and I'm</font>

00:51:38,430 --> 00:51:43,529
interested in what other people have to

say<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> if I ran one of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> those companies i</font>

speech but it is difficult to figure out

00:51:47,910 --> 00:51:52,020
where you draw certain lines<font color="#CCCCCC"> I suppose</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">what maybe</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> my whole talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font>

1181
00:52:14,849 --> 00:52:20,940
mansplaining and I apologize for that

1182
00:52:16,920 --> 00:52:24,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">no huh arms</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so my</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> question was to add to</font>

1183
00:52:20,940 --> 00:52:26,369
someone who asked earlier about how<font color="#CCCCCC"> out</font>

1184
00:52:24,750 --> 00:52:29,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">the ribbons can have bias and i wanted</font>

1185
00:52:26,369 --> 00:52:32,790
to add<font color="#CCCCCC"> onto</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that and say like algorithms</font>

1186
00:52:29,520 --> 00:52:34,740
are you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know often like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> simulation</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so if</font>

1187
00:52:32,790 --> 00:52:39,000
you think about<font color="#CCCCCC"> i was reading</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> an article</font>

1188
00:52:34,740 --> 00:52:41,069
about the algorithms used to predict

1189
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:44,310
whether someone will<font color="#E5E5E5"> wind up in jail</font>

1190
00:52:41,070 --> 00:52:47,520
again after being released<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it was</font>

1191
00:52:44,310 --> 00:52:50,430
<font color="#CCCCCC">was really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> interesting to see how like</font>

1192
00:52:47,520 --> 00:52:51,690
the inputs into an algorithm<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

1193
00:52:50,430 --> 00:52:54,960
affect the outcome and can actually

1194
00:52:51,690 --> 00:52:56,280
cause like racism or bias in one way or

1195
00:52:54,960 --> 00:52:58,200
another depending on how the algorithm

1196
00:52:56,280 --> 00:53:01,410
is crafted so do you have any ideas

1197
00:52:58,200 --> 00:53:02,730
about how we can ask for transparency

1198
00:53:01,410 --> 00:53:05,250
especially from like government

1199
00:53:02,730 --> 00:53:07,589
institutions about the<font color="#CCCCCC"> like machine</font>

1200
00:53:05,250 --> 00:53:09,599
<font color="#CCCCCC">learning algorithms or or the inputs</font>

1201
00:53:07,589 --> 00:53:11,910
that they use<font color="#E5E5E5"> into those algorithms</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> uh</font>

1202
00:53:09,599 --> 00:53:14,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">to to solve these problems that are</font>

1203
00:53:11,910 --> 00:53:17,098
really complicated and you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're</font>

1204
00:53:14,700 --> 00:53:19,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">uh you know a machine so how can machine</font>

1205
00:53:17,099 --> 00:53:20,790
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> bias but the inputs into those</font>

1206
00:53:19,290 --> 00:53:22,740
systems

1207
00:53:20,790 --> 00:53:24,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">so I as the cheeks who</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i've</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> been working</font>

1208
00:53:22,740 --> 00:53:25,950
with<font color="#CCCCCC"> lon press stuff is giving a talk</font>

1209
00:53:24,810 --> 00:53:28,259
tomorrow

1210
00:53:25,950 --> 00:53:30,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">uh that deals with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> them how they make</font>

1211
00:53:28,260 --> 00:53:34,350
changes in<font color="#CCCCCC"> oakland around</font>

1212
00:53:30,210 --> 00:53:36,720
anti-surveillance<font color="#E5E5E5"> and oh hi</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> yeah so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

1213
00:53:34,350 --> 00:53:38,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">sunday</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> my apologies not tomorrow sunday</font>

1214
00:53:36,720 --> 00:53:41,549
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i recommend going and seeing that</font>

1215
00:53:38,310 --> 00:53:43,560
<font color="#CCCCCC">talk to see how citizens can impact that</font>

1216
00:53:41,550 --> 00:53:45,450
sort of thing

1217
00:53:43,560 --> 00:53:47,790
what I've seen specifically an<font color="#CCCCCC"> open</font>

1218
00:53:45,450 --> 00:53:49,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">source and transparency is the election</font>

1219
00:53:47,790 --> 00:53:50,640
of certain candidates who promote those

1220
00:53:49,230 --> 00:53:55,500
values and that's starting to happen

1221
00:53:50,640 --> 00:53:57,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">then</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Kalos</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Manhattan is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one example</font>

1222
00:53:55,500 --> 00:54:00,090
<font color="#CCCCCC">Rand Paul was interested in open source</font>

1223
00:53:57,660 --> 00:54:03,029
when<font color="#CCCCCC"> i was working</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with him so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I think</font>

1224
00:54:00,090 --> 00:54:05,460
we can vote for those candidates and

1225
00:54:03,030 --> 00:54:07,770
make it clear that we care and perhaps

1226
00:54:05,460 --> 00:54:09,240
maybe like<font color="#E5E5E5"> become a voting</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> bloc is</font>

1227
00:54:07,770 --> 00:54:11,250
hackers or something like<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think that</font>

1228
00:54:09,240 --> 00:54:14,100
there might be political ways that we

1229
00:54:11,250 --> 00:54:17,580
can communicate to the reps that we care

1230
00:54:14,100 --> 00:54:19,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i think we can become louder on</font>

1231
00:54:17,580 --> 00:54:20,490
specific issues like<font color="#CCCCCC"> if people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

1232
00:54:19,140 --> 00:54:22,770
getting more jail time because an

1233
00:54:20,490 --> 00:54:24,899
algorithm determines that<font color="#E5E5E5"> that seems</font>

1234
00:54:22,770 --> 00:54:26,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">like something that citizens should be</font>

1235
00:54:24,900 --> 00:54:29,490
able to see<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right</font>

1236
00:54:26,820 --> 00:54:34,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">no thanks thank you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i think we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have time</font>

1237
00:54:29,490 --> 00:54:40,640
for one more question<font color="#E5E5E5"> no one comes up</font>

1238
00:54:34,020 --> 00:54:40,640
<font color="#CCCCCC">alright thank you so much</font>
