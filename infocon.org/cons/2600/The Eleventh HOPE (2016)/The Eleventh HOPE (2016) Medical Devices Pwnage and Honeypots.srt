bit later and there's my twitter handle

32
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:20,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">ok so in terms of the agenda for today</font>

33
00:01:17,850 --> 00:01:21,960
and the number of topic areas will cover

34
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:23,820
related to medical device security give

35
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:26,309
you a sense of the landscape<font color="#E5E5E5"> some</font>

36
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:28,080
specific research<font color="#CCCCCC"> will</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> start off with</font>

37
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:31,439
you know why we're interested in medical

38
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:34,229
devices at all<font color="#E5E5E5"> go into some phase</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> one</font>

39
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:37,258
research on device vulnerabilities just

40
00:01:34,229 --> 00:01:40,259
you know what in general<font color="#CCCCCC"> DC will talk</font>

41
00:01:37,259 --> 00:01:41,909
about the<font color="#E5E5E5"> secondly the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> internet exposure</font>

42
00:01:40,259 --> 00:01:44,880
of these devices<font color="#E5E5E5"> so are these things</font>

43
00:01:41,909 --> 00:01:46,890
actually on the internet and admin

44
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:49,199
access<font color="#CCCCCC"> how</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> difficult</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is it to achieve</font>

45
00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:53,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">admin access you need to create</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 0</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> days</font>

46
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:55,470
to achieve that and<font color="#CCCCCC"> honey pot research</font>

47
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:57,689
so are these attacks<font color="#E5E5E5"> reality so if you</font>

48
00:01:55,470 --> 00:02:00,119
put some medical devices out there<font color="#CCCCCC"> what</font>

49
00:01:57,689 --> 00:02:03,059
happens and<font color="#CCCCCC"> and we'll get into a little</font>

50
00:02:00,119 --> 00:02:04,740
bit in terms of the diagnosis so what do

51
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:06,390
we think are some of the root causes for

52
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:07,619
some of this activity<font color="#CCCCCC"> or some of these</font>

53
00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:09,179
vulnerabilities and then some of the

54
00:02:07,619 --> 00:02:10,500
treatment<font color="#CCCCCC"> plants so what do we think</font>

55
00:02:09,179 --> 00:02:13,590
should be done about that

56
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:15,540
so before we<font color="#E5E5E5"> get into this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> at</font>

57
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:18,150
<font color="#CCCCCC">too much just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> by way of definition when</font>

58
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:19,019
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about medical devices that can</font>

59
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:20,580
mean different things to different

60
00:02:19,019 --> 00:02:23,099
people could<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a surgical instrument</font>

61
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:27,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">for example we're talking about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> software</font>

62
00:02:23,099 --> 00:02:29,819
<font color="#CCCCCC">driven and continually or periodically</font>

63
00:02:27,510 --> 00:02:31,649
connected devices<font color="#CCCCCC"> so these</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are the these</font>

64
00:02:29,819 --> 00:02:34,319
are devices that will at some point

65
00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:36,360
connect to a network and also have

66
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:37,708
software in them<font color="#E5E5E5"> and when we talk about</font>

67
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:40,560
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> medical device sometimes you'll</font>

68
00:02:37,709 --> 00:02:42,480
think of just the actual physical

69
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:44,970
hardware<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that's maybe running</font>

70
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:46,380
embedded<font color="#CCCCCC"> linux</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> or something like that</font>

71
00:02:44,970 --> 00:02:49,709
a real-time operating system were

72
00:02:46,380 --> 00:02:51,180
talking about the entire solution<font color="#CCCCCC"> so if</font>

73
00:02:49,709 --> 00:02:53,549
<font color="#E5E5E5">there's a device that's controlled by a</font>

74
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:54,810
computer<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that's important for the</font>

75
00:02:53,549 --> 00:02:57,959
function of the medical device we

76
00:02:54,810 --> 00:03:00,000
include that in this definition<font color="#E5E5E5"> so in</font>

77
00:02:57,959 --> 00:03:03,299
<font color="#E5E5E5">terms of why we would research medical</font>

78
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:06,360
devices at all and I guess firstly

79
00:03:03,299 --> 00:03:08,459
there's certainly a personal impact and

80
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:09,720
so it's just<font color="#CCCCCC"> time it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can kind</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of see</font>

81
00:03:08,459 --> 00:03:11,849
through these lights in terms of the

82
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:14,519
folks in the room how many of you rely

83
00:03:11,849 --> 00:03:16,140
on a medical device<font color="#E5E5E5"> daily or know</font>

84
00:03:14,519 --> 00:03:19,680
somebody that relies on a medical device

85
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:21,929
<font color="#E5E5E5">daily</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> yeah Wow</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> lotta guys</font>

86
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:23,609
yep<font color="#CCCCCC"> and you know I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think similarly if</font>

87
00:03:21,930 --> 00:03:25,889
you think about maybe you don't

88
00:03:23,609 --> 00:03:28,019
<font color="#E5E5E5">personally or somebody you know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> doesn't</font>

89
00:03:25,889 --> 00:03:29,700
on a daily basis certainly within the

90
00:03:28,019 --> 00:03:32,579
past year<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm sure each of us can think</font>

91
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:34,230
of examples where someone the other

92
00:03:32,579 --> 00:03:36,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">selves or</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> someone</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> cared about was in</font>

93
00:03:34,230 --> 00:03:37,349
this situation<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a hospital where they</font>

94
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:40,980
they were connected to one of these

95
00:03:37,349 --> 00:03:42,510
devices so even it even if we're not

96
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:45,328
personally affected<font color="#CCCCCC"> at a given</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> point</font>

97
00:03:42,510 --> 00:03:47,429
someone<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we care may be affected and</font>

98
00:03:45,329 --> 00:03:49,200
that's certainly<font color="#E5E5E5"> a high personal</font>

99
00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:51,299
motivation for looking at device

100
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:54,000
vulnerabilities<font color="#E5E5E5"> an example that comes to</font>

101
00:03:51,299 --> 00:03:56,370
mind for myself so few years ago<font color="#E5E5E5"> my</font>

102
00:03:54,000 --> 00:04:00,840
sister-in-law and she<font color="#E5E5E5"> was pregnant with</font>

00:03:56,370 --> 00:04:02,310
twins<font color="#E5E5E5"> she was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> had to go</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to NICU</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> because</font>

104
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:05,489
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> seems like the twins might be</font>

105
00:04:02,310 --> 00:04:08,010
arriving a few weeks early and so my

106
00:04:05,489 --> 00:04:09,930
wife and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I went and SAT with her and</font>

107
00:04:08,010 --> 00:04:12,030
we're talking with her<font color="#E5E5E5"> in that the</font>

108
00:04:09,930 --> 00:04:14,430
nurses would come in periodically to

109
00:04:12,030 --> 00:04:16,470
check on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> the heartbeat of these</font>

110
00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:17,608
babies to see if they were<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay and</font>

111
00:04:16,470 --> 00:04:19,829
whether or not they needed to do an

00:04:17,608 --> 00:04:23,190
emergency see or something like that and

113
00:04:19,829 --> 00:04:25,229
<font color="#E5E5E5">the nurse had come in and we notice that</font>

114
00:04:23,190 --> 00:04:27,110
she kept messing with the the device

115
00:04:25,229 --> 00:04:30,169
itself with the<font color="#CCCCCC"> sensor</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and she</font>

116
00:04:27,110 --> 00:04:31,669
<font color="#CCCCCC">seemed a little frustrated and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and you</font>

117
00:04:30,169 --> 00:04:33,349
know that of course made us all a little

118
00:04:31,669 --> 00:04:35,750
bit nervous in terms of what's going on

119

<font color="#CCCCCC">i do these</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you know is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it time I mean to</font>

the<font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we need to have action here</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

121
00:04:37,879 --> 00:04:41,870
she said<font color="#E5E5E5"> well you know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> hang on hang on</font>

122
00:04:40,159 --> 00:04:45,349
it may just be that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I need to reboot the</font>

123
00:04:41,870 --> 00:04:48,319
computer<font color="#CCCCCC"> exactly what you want to hear</font>

124
00:04:45,349 --> 00:04:49,909
in that situation<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the second thing</font>

125
00:04:48,319 --> 00:04:51,710
that you exactly want to see in that

126
00:04:49,909 --> 00:04:53,780
situation is when she<font color="#CCCCCC"> reboot the</font>

129
00:04:54,289 --> 00:04:59,030

yes<font color="#E5E5E5"> so you know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I'd</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> thought about</font>

132
00:05:02,449 --> 00:05:05,840
it that point is that what this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> windows XP machine and it</font>

135
00:05:07,639 --> 00:05:11,870
certainly got me thinking a lot more

00:05:10,219 --> 00:05:14,990
about the security implications that

137
00:05:11,870 --> 00:05:17,029
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to talk about today one of</font>

138
00:05:14,990 --> 00:05:19,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> other things that we like to discuss</font>

139
00:05:17,029 --> 00:05:21,740
when it comes to medical device security

140
00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:23,240
vulnerabilities is<font color="#E5E5E5"> sometimes</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

141
00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:25,490
question well who would actually do this

142
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:27,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">who would actually try and attack</font>

143
00:05:25,490 --> 00:05:29,210
medical device and<font color="#E5E5E5"> and exploited or</font>

144
00:05:27,710 --> 00:05:31,039
something like that and<font color="#CCCCCC"> and getting</font>

145
00:05:29,210 --> 00:05:32,989
<font color="#E5E5E5">beyond the fact of you know people do</font>

146
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:36,378
crazy things and we<font color="#E5E5E5"> should rely on the</font>

147
00:05:32,990 --> 00:05:39,139
you know trusting the internet right<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

148
00:05:36,379 --> 00:05:41,599
one key point is that malicious intent

149
00:05:39,139 --> 00:05:44,599
is not a prerequisite to a patient

150
00:05:41,599 --> 00:05:47,539
safety issue<font color="#CCCCCC"> so it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was an example of</font>

151
00:05:44,599 --> 00:05:51,919
that is a few years ago<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> five years</font>

152
00:05:47,539 --> 00:05:54,289
ago at a hospital in<font color="#CCCCCC"> Austria to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> gunshot</font>

153
00:05:51,919 --> 00:05:56,568
patients were admitted<font color="#E5E5E5"> and they were</font>

154
00:05:54,289 --> 00:05:59,120
connected to morphine<font color="#E5E5E5"> drip</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sand most</font>

155
00:05:56,569 --> 00:06:01,639
morphing pumps and you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know as they were</font>

156
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:04,909
receiving this morphine<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're like it</font>

157
00:06:01,639 --> 00:06:10,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">was pretty</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> good you know would be better</font>

158
00:06:04,909 --> 00:06:11,629
than the morphine<font color="#E5E5E5"> more morphine right so</font>

159
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:14,029
they set out they looked at these

160
00:06:11,629 --> 00:06:17,810
devices and they started to engage in

161
00:06:14,029 --> 00:06:20,689
some very apt style hacking using this

162
00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:23,629
technology called google<font color="#CCCCCC"> know if you</font>

163
00:06:20,689 --> 00:06:26,330
guys<font color="#E5E5E5"> have you heard</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm so they</font>

164
00:06:23,629 --> 00:06:30,620
went on<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Google</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and they found the</font>

165
00:06:26,330 --> 00:06:32,900
password for this device on<font color="#CCCCCC"> google and</font>

166
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:34,550
proceeded to up the maximum dose<font color="#CCCCCC"> allowed</font>

167
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:37,370
and get addicted to morphine very

168
00:06:34,550 --> 00:06:39,020
quickly and they were both admit you

169
00:06:37,370 --> 00:06:40,639
know that the nurses<font color="#E5E5E5"> recognize something</font>

170
00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:42,498
was wrong they<font color="#CCCCCC"> switched them to patches</font>

171
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:44,419
after a time but these guys were highly

172
00:06:42,499 --> 00:06:47,509
addicted to morphine<font color="#CCCCCC"> had a respiratory</font>

173
00:06:44,419 --> 00:06:50,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">events and definitely did not have a</font>

174
00:06:47,509 --> 00:06:52,969
good day as a result<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so again</font>

175
00:06:50,810 --> 00:06:55,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">malicious intent not a prerequisite so</font>

176
00:06:52,969 --> 00:06:56,810
it doesn't take a malicious person to go

177
00:06:55,310 --> 00:06:58,460
out and do this patients could

178
00:06:56,810 --> 00:06:59,629
potentially take advantage of security

179
00:06:58,460 --> 00:07:02,719
vulnerabilities and do harm to

180
00:06:59,629 --> 00:07:04,370
themselves<font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what are we doing related</font>

181
00:07:02,719 --> 00:07:05,629
to this when I say we I mean security

182
00:07:04,370 --> 00:07:07,909
researchers involved<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm the</font>

183
00:07:05,629 --> 00:07:10,009
<font color="#CCCCCC">Calabrian in Scott nine others so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> few</font>

184
00:07:07,909 --> 00:07:12,319
<font color="#E5E5E5">different things</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so first is looking at</font>

185
00:07:10,009 --> 00:07:14,629
the actual medical devices to discover

186
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:15,560
patient safety issues<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with the device</font>

187
00:07:14,629 --> 00:07:17,210
itself

188
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:19,250
what's going on<font color="#E5E5E5"> what's the vulnerability</font>

189
00:07:17,210 --> 00:07:20,960
landscape there<font color="#E5E5E5"> and what types of the</font>

190
00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:24,229
<font color="#CCCCCC">floor what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are the types of laws we can</font>

191
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:26,448
see and how can we equip you know the

192
00:07:24,229 --> 00:07:27,859
people that are doing these<font color="#E5E5E5"> to prevent</font>

193
00:07:26,449 --> 00:07:30,650
these vulnerabilities from being

194
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:33,050
introduced<font color="#E5E5E5"> new devices and secondly</font>

195
00:07:30,650 --> 00:07:35,599
<font color="#E5E5E5">coordination</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and notification so as we</font>

196
00:07:33,050 --> 00:07:37,370
uncover these vulnerabilities<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

197
00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:38,599
coordinating the disclosure of those

198
00:07:37,370 --> 00:07:39,919
vulnerabilities working with the

199
00:07:38,599 --> 00:07:42,169
affected parties working with the

200
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:43,818
<font color="#E5E5E5">manufacturers working with the provider</font>

201
00:07:42,169 --> 00:07:46,279
organizations to try and get these

202
00:07:43,819 --> 00:07:48,979
problems addressed<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then thirdly</font>

203
00:07:46,279 --> 00:07:52,039
<font color="#E5E5E5">public awareness</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so talking about these</font>

204
00:07:48,979 --> 00:07:54,139
issues<font color="#E5E5E5"> and forms like this and for you</font>

205
00:07:52,039 --> 00:07:56,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> other broader groups talking about</font>

206
00:07:54,139 --> 00:07:57,770
just the idea of the fact that these are

207
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:58,939
you know these are computers at the end

208
00:07:57,770 --> 00:08:02,359
of the day and there's an issue here

209
00:07:58,939 --> 00:08:03,529
that we just start focusing on<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm</font>

210
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:04,939
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to turn it over to Scott now is</font>

211
00:08:03,529 --> 00:08:07,009
going to talk specifically about the

212
00:08:04,939 --> 00:08:08,810
phase one research and overall device

213
00:08:07,009 --> 00:08:10,099
vulnerabilities and then go into a few

214
00:08:08,810 --> 00:08:15,199
other areas of research

215
00:08:10,099 --> 00:08:18,378
<font color="#CCCCCC">alright so you see that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> morphine</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> stores</font>

216
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:20,089
pretty awesome on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the I think the one</font>

217
00:08:18,379 --> 00:08:23,210
thing that<font color="#CCCCCC"> that it comes to mind before</font>

218
00:08:20,089 --> 00:08:25,009
we start talking about all these<font color="#E5E5E5"> super</font>

219
00:08:23,210 --> 00:08:28,549
<font color="#E5E5E5">elite advanced vulnerabilities is that</font>

220
00:08:25,009 --> 00:08:32,060
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> paints a good picture</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

221
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:33,769
<font color="#E5E5E5">who has been on morphine yes so if you</font>

222
00:08:32,059 --> 00:08:34,609
can hack into<font color="#E5E5E5"> a medical device on</font>

223
00:08:33,769 --> 00:08:36,510
morphine

224
00:08:34,610 --> 00:08:43,110
it can't be that difficult

225
00:08:36,510 --> 00:08:44,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so here we go so instead started on</font>

226
00:08:43,110 --> 00:08:47,100
this kind of path like four and a half

227
00:08:44,910 --> 00:08:49,740
years ago<font color="#E5E5E5"> and for me it was kind of this</font>

228
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:52,020
like personal passion thing of working

229
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:53,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">at a healthcare organization and really</font>

230
00:08:52,020 --> 00:08:55,260
you know healthcare<font color="#CCCCCC"> organizations as a</font>

231
00:08:53,550 --> 00:08:57,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">whole have been you know focused on</font>

232
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:59,970
patient privacy and protecting patient

233
00:08:57,390 --> 00:09:01,770
information which is important<font color="#E5E5E5"> but when</font>

234
00:08:59,970 --> 00:09:04,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> seen these devices become connected</font>

235
00:09:01,770 --> 00:09:07,680
you know to the network to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> as you'll</font>

236
00:09:04,650 --> 00:09:09,120
see here to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> internet potentially</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

237
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:11,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">i was able to identify vulnerabilities</font>

238
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:14,550
work with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the manufacturer to resolve</font>

239
00:09:11,790 --> 00:09:15,959
that that kind of went to you know every

240
00:09:14,550 --> 00:09:18,180
healthcare<font color="#E5E5E5"> organizations mission and</font>

241
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:20,340
values of<font color="#CCCCCC"> new patient</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> safety and quality</font>

242
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:22,410
care and so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really felt you know</font>

243
00:09:20,340 --> 00:09:24,150
passionate about that from the safety

244
00:09:22,410 --> 00:09:27,209
perspective of really having an impact

245
00:09:24,150 --> 00:09:29,220
on healthcare<font color="#E5E5E5"> organizations mission and</font>

246
00:09:27,210 --> 00:09:30,930
so what we found over all<font color="#CCCCCC"> I've</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> done</font>

247
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:33,420
<font color="#CCCCCC">handful of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> talk to the last you know</font>

248
00:09:30,930 --> 00:09:35,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">two-and-a-half years on this research in</font>

249
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:37,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">detail so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you look like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> DEFCON talks</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

250
00:09:35,310 --> 00:09:39,689
example if you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know hard level</font>

251
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:42,449
<font color="#CCCCCC">hour-long technical detail talks on each</font>

252
00:09:39,690 --> 00:09:43,470
of these<font color="#E5E5E5"> phases</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> but the first thing was</font>

253
00:09:42,450 --> 00:09:45,270
when we<font color="#CCCCCC"> started to look at device</font>

254
00:09:43,470 --> 00:09:47,040
vulnerabilities it was<font color="#CCCCCC"> are these</font>

255
00:09:45,270 --> 00:09:49,560
advanced attacks or are these really

256
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:53,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">security hygiene issues that we've had</font>

257
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:54,750
you know no one<font color="#E5E5E5"> fixes for four years and</font>

258
00:09:53,430 --> 00:09:57,239
that's kind of what we found out like

259
00:09:54,750 --> 00:09:59,310
this is the top three that i would call

260
00:09:57,240 --> 00:10:02,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">like big mistakes or security hygiene</font>

261
00:09:59,310 --> 00:10:04,890
issues that we still see<font color="#E5E5E5"> in devices that</font>

262
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:06,689
are implemented in you know in hospitals

263
00:10:04,890 --> 00:10:08,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">and healthcare provider environment and</font>

264
00:10:06,690 --> 00:10:09,900
so that first one is<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know we default</font>

265
00:10:08,550 --> 00:10:11,819
<font color="#CCCCCC">are hard-coded</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> credentials which</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm</font>

266
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:14,040
gonna touch on later today and show you

267
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:17,100
some of the awesome passwords<font color="#E5E5E5"> that these</font>

268
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:19,800
systems use the second is<font color="#E5E5E5"> no</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> known</font>

269
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:21,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">software vulnerabilities and that's you</font>

270
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:26,130
know<font color="#CCCCCC"> two atoms point we still do have a</font>

271
00:10:21,510 --> 00:10:29,310

with that information

00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:51,420
what types of attacks and then we'll get

look at some of this stuff they get face

00:16:57,270 --> 00:17:00,569
value might think oh well this is an

00:17:03,180 --> 00:17:07,709
do with this information and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think</font>

00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:09,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">certainly if you think about it a little</font>

bit further you'll start to realize you

458
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:12,780
can do something interesting with this

this information available to you<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

organization you know the floor and

472

486
00:18:03,470 --> 00:18:06,980
make it as realistic as possible so that

516
00:19:12,530 --> 00:19:16,129
there's a way to get to them so you

517
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:19,340
could create a custom payload when you

518
00:19:16,130 --> 00:19:21,050
explain that to very quickly<font color="#E5E5E5"> get in and</font>

519
00:19:19,340 --> 00:19:22,550
then pivot off to another system that

520
00:19:21,050 --> 00:19:24,710
you find is interesting and that you

521
00:19:22,550 --> 00:19:27,200
want to have is the next point of attack

522
00:19:24,710 --> 00:19:28,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">so certainly a few different varieties</font>

523
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:30,140
of types of attacks that you can do with

<font color="#E5E5E5">just this fairly straightforward</font>

we<font color="#E5E5E5"> said</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay we have vulnerable devices</font>

549
00:20:30,830 --> 00:20:36,980
is it to get remote admin access<font color="#CCCCCC"> if</font>

00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:40,070
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the case and so this is a</font>

was up until like two or three months

604

before there was new products being

is like coming from like $2,000<font color="#CCCCCC"> 2 2016</font>

bottom this one's awesome you see this a

635
00:23:55,140 --> 00:23:59,850
lot like these<font color="#E5E5E5"> windy</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and see logins</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> or</font>

uses<font color="#E5E5E5"> is to be able to support that</font>

638
00:24:01,380 --> 00:24:04,950
system but real<font color="#E5E5E5"> poor you know practice</font>

639
00:24:04,380 --> 00:24:07,320
and

640
00:24:04,950 --> 00:24:11,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">really weak passwords on those systems</font>

641
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:12,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">so this is a word cloud I mean what</font>

642
00:24:11,430 --> 00:24:15,300
better when you have a bunch of

643
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:18,600
passwords<font color="#CCCCCC"> in to create a word cloud</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

644
00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:20,879
so this is a<font color="#CCCCCC"> hundred and fifty</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sets of</font>

645
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:23,669
usernames and passwords in a word cloud

646
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:26,280
and in big guys definitely you know

647
00:24:23,670 --> 00:24:28,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">leading that charge anyone to notice</font>

648
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:29,100
anything interesting about the big guy

649
00:24:28,410 --> 00:24:32,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">though</font>

650
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:33,689
<font color="#CCCCCC">No so if you looked when i had when i</font>

651
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:36,210
showed you the actual password it was

652
00:24:33,690 --> 00:24:36,720
pound pound big<font color="#E5E5E5"> guy pound big one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> guy</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">one</font>

654
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:41,370
well<font color="#E5E5E5"> I quickly found out that word cloud</font>

655
00:24:39,930 --> 00:24:45,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">app</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sec is much better and actually</font>

656
00:24:41,370 --> 00:24:49,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">sanitizes your data input so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i couldn't</font>

657
00:24:45,810 --> 00:24:54,690
get it to do a leading pound sign

658
00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:55,710
so when we went through disclosure<font color="#E5E5E5"> some</font>

659
00:24:54,690 --> 00:24:57,720
of the things were

<font color="#CCCCCC">hey</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of these are default and in</font>

661
00:24:57,720 --> 00:25:02,250
some cases they are default and in some

662
00:24:59,610 --> 00:25:04,080
cases they do actually provide you know

663
00:25:02,250 --> 00:25:05,490
instructions in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> manuals that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:07,199
given to the installers or to the

665
00:25:05,490 --> 00:25:08,580
hospital systems that

666
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:10,710
hey<font color="#E5E5E5"> you should change this and this is</font>

667
00:25:08,580 --> 00:25:13,169
how you should do it<font color="#E5E5E5"> but saying they're</font>

668
00:25:10,710 --> 00:25:15,390
all default<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think is contradictory</font>

669
00:25:13,170 --> 00:25:17,880
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> i will show you some examples</font>

670
00:25:15,390 --> 00:25:19,560
inside of that specific documentation

671
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:21,630
that would indicate otherwise and these

672
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:24,389

this really quick<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's basically you</font>

those types of things it's like dosing

733
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:37,210
type of thing that we look at this

00:27:34,780 --> 00:27:39,010
specific system<font color="#CCCCCC"> i haven't tested i have</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">done stuff exactly similar to this on</font>

other<font color="#CCCCCC"> manufacturers system but that</font>

737
00:27:41,020 --> 00:27:45,040
gives you an idea of you know how we try

738
00:27:42,850 --> 00:27:47,949
to find intentional use and then make it

739
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:49,540
do something else<font color="#CCCCCC"> so we have honorable</font>

744
00:27:56,350 --> 00:28:00,189
<font color="#E5E5E5">so with him to you know set up some</font>

basically looking at you know setting

them up realistic so if they had<font color="#E5E5E5"> poor</font>

specific campaigns against specific

00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:19,390
to steal intellectual property stuff

00:28:17,230 --> 00:28:22,330

an understanding of the motivations

758
00:28:22,330 --> 00:28:26,949
so this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> kind of a setup what we did</font>

759
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:28,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">again service connection strings</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we did</font>

00:28:26,950 --> 00:28:31,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">everything to where you could you know</font>

00:28:28,900 --> 00:28:32,940
<font color="#CCCCCC">Google dork it would</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be exactly the same</font>

we<font color="#E5E5E5"> replicate</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a real-world</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> environment</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font>

those systems that were XP<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we did</font>

00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:48,540
it is in the environment<font color="#E5E5E5"> remote web</font>

management services those types of

things and then file structure

772
00:28:50,190 --> 00:28:53,640
attributes all the way down to make sure

773

that those were accurate some of them<font color="#E5E5E5"> if</font>

thanks guys so<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah it when i was</font>

looking at honey<font color="#E5E5E5"> any net stuff</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> honey pot</font>

857
00:31:53,350 --> 00:31:58,000
yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's the kind of that's good</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> way</font>

858
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:59,350
right<font color="#E5E5E5"> we didn't see any direct attack</font>

859
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,580
vector like people going after a

860
00:31:59,350 --> 00:32:03,340
specific medical device and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I was</font>

861
00:32:00,580 --> 00:32:05,500
thinking you know but how good does that

862
00:32:03,340 --> 00:32:07,000
really make me feel right if I'm a

863
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:09,220
patient<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm connect to a medical device</font>

864
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:12,370
somebody didn't intend to compromise it

865
00:32:09,220 --> 00:32:15,010
but it still is compromised<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I think</font>

866
00:32:12,370 --> 00:32:17,139
there's certainly an element of<font color="#CCCCCC"> yeah</font>

867
00:32:15,010 --> 00:32:20,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's still an uncomfortable place to be</font>

868
00:32:17,140 --> 00:32:21,970
so why is this stuff happening<font color="#CCCCCC"> so in</font>

869
00:32:20,230 --> 00:32:24,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">terms of the the nature of the problem</font>

870
00:32:21,970 --> 00:32:25,299
we can talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> your first the fact</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

871
00:32:24,070 --> 00:32:28,030
<font color="#CCCCCC">i mentioned earlier we're talking about</font>

872
00:32:25,299 --> 00:32:30,158
<font color="#E5E5E5">software driven system so software has</font>

873
00:32:28,030 --> 00:32:31,899
flaws<font color="#CCCCCC"> anyone designed a soft piece off</font>

874
00:32:30,159 --> 00:32:37,179
without a flaw<font color="#E5E5E5"> out there</font>

875
00:32:31,900 --> 00:32:38,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">ok few of you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> great hit exactly</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> exit</font>

876
00:32:37,179 --> 00:32:42,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">return</font>

877
00:32:38,950 --> 00:32:44,200
<font color="#CCCCCC">ok so yall software</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> has flaws right and</font>

878
00:32:42,970 --> 00:32:45,850
when you connect something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's</font>

879
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:48,159
previously not been connected you're

880
00:32:45,850 --> 00:32:49,959
increasing the interaction point so if

881
00:32:48,159 --> 00:32:52,990
you have this like great idea to have a

882
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:55,480
you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> software-driven</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you know</font>

883
00:32:52,990 --> 00:32:57,100

vulnerable exposed<font color="#E5E5E5"> one</font>

885
00:32:57,100 --> 00:32:59,860
right so it's just the nature<font color="#E5E5E5"> its</font>

886
00:32:58,330 --> 00:33:02,530
inherent to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> the thing that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you're</font>

887
00:32:59,860 --> 00:33:05,530
building<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then also we see is the</font>

888
00:33:02,530 --> 00:33:07,660
lack of alignment<font color="#E5E5E5"> from a patient safety</font>

890
00:33:07,660 --> 00:33:11,919
<font color="#E5E5E5">device cybersecurity practices so we</font>

891
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:14,410
talked about this earlier that HIPAA

892
00:33:11,919 --> 00:33:16,179
<font color="#E5E5E5">certainly is a driver</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> but in terms of</font>

what is the potential impact from<font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

894
00:33:16,179 --> 00:33:21,970
patient safety perspective<font color="#E5E5E5"> that didn't</font>

895
00:33:18,970 --> 00:33:24,490
seem to be as much<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're so in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> terms</font>

896
00:33:21,970 --> 00:33:25,750
of problem awareness so we talked about

897
00:33:24,490 --> 00:33:27,610
a lot of this<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> gonna go through</font>

898
00:33:25,750 --> 00:33:29,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">in detail but essentially we have all</font>

899
00:33:27,610 --> 00:33:30,820
these medical<font color="#E5E5E5"> devices connected to the</font>

900
00:33:29,110 --> 00:33:32,469
internet this is going to be growing in

901
00:33:30,820 --> 00:33:34,178
terms of connected medical devices in

902
00:33:32,470 --> 00:33:35,289
general this is not you know tomorrow

903
00:33:34,179 --> 00:33:37,000
people are gonna be like oh you know

904
00:33:35,289 --> 00:33:38,530
what we should really just unplug

905
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:40,990
everything from the network<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's not</font>

906
00:33:38,530 --> 00:33:44,139
<font color="#E5E5E5">gonna happen and we still have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> hippo</font>

907
00:33:40,990 --> 00:33:46,690
which focuses on patient safety and we

908
00:33:44,140 --> 00:33:49,120
have the FDA which does not<font color="#E5E5E5"> validate</font>

909
00:33:46,690 --> 00:33:50,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">cyber</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> safety controls</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so i think a lot</font>

910
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:52,899
of people especially you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> new to</font>

911
00:33:50,950 --> 00:33:55,780
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> might think well the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> FDA should be</font>

912
00:33:52,900 --> 00:33:57,970
or has been validating<font color="#E5E5E5"> cyber safety</font>

913
00:33:55,780 --> 00:34:00,490
controls on all these devices<font color="#E5E5E5"> that is</font>

914
00:33:57,970 --> 00:34:03,220
not the case and as we talked about

915
00:34:00,490 --> 00:34:04,480
malicious intent is not a prerequisite

916
00:34:03,220 --> 00:34:06,010
so it doesn't really matter whether or

917
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:07,960
not you believe<font color="#E5E5E5"> that people are out</font>

918
00:34:06,010 --> 00:34:10,690
there trying to do this<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have a</font>

negative potential negative outcome<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

00:34:10,690 --> 00:34:12,879
terms<font color="#E5E5E5"> of looking at the problem in a</font>

921
00:34:11,918 --> 00:34:16,149
different way if you look at the

922
00:34:12,879 --> 00:34:18,399
ecosystem of people that would need to

923
00:34:16,149 --> 00:34:19,810
be involved to address this problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

924
00:34:18,399 --> 00:34:21,429
what we observed was that there<font color="#CCCCCC"> seemed</font>

to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> silos so you have the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> healthcare</font>

926

doing the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Met device manufacturers doing</font>

931
00:34:29,949 --> 00:34:33,520
this is certainly improved over the past

few years is<font color="#CCCCCC"> scott will talk about in a</font>

00:34:37,090 --> 00:34:42,850
people to talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> so here's some attack</font>

936
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:46,570
scenarios that i like to call<font color="#CCCCCC"> TV</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> show</font>

937
00:34:42,850 --> 00:34:49,270
scripts or risks to plan for<font color="#E5E5E5"> right so</font>

938
00:34:46,570 --> 00:34:50,560
this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> scripter this real and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

939
00:34:49,270 --> 00:34:52,449
<font color="#CCCCCC">reason I say that is because you can</font>

940
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:54,820
certainly go down the path of fire on a

941
00:34:52,449 --> 00:34:58,029
lot of these things i'm not a huge<font color="#CCCCCC"> 52</font>

942
00:34:54,820 --> 00:35:00,100
fan<font color="#CCCCCC"> I guess</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I do find it interesting</font>

943
00:34:58,030 --> 00:35:02,020
just to think about these risks and make

944
00:35:00,100 --> 00:35:04,000
that risk determination if you can't

945
00:35:02,020 --> 00:35:06,460
explore it then you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> make a decision</font>

946
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:09,010
so here's an example of one fetal heart

947
00:35:06,460 --> 00:35:10,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">rate monitors in a NICU</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> reboot</font>

948
00:35:09,010 --> 00:35:12,150
periodically

949
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:14,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">due to incorrectly operating malware</font>

950
00:35:12,150 --> 00:35:18,869
increasing stress among staff and

951
00:35:14,430 --> 00:35:22,230
patients<font color="#E5E5E5"> so is this real or TV show and</font>

952
00:35:18,869 --> 00:35:24,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">I want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to guess</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> real right yeah</font>

953
00:35:22,230 --> 00:35:28,230
ransomware<font color="#CCCCCC"> encryption</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> key application</font>

954
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:30,300
configuration files on an MRI controller

955
00:35:28,230 --> 00:35:34,079
causing critical care patients to be

956
00:35:30,300 --> 00:35:36,030
relocated to another hospital<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

957
00:35:34,079 --> 00:35:38,010
<font color="#CCCCCC">yeah I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't know that exact but you can</font>

958
00:35:36,030 --> 00:35:40,020
certainly<font color="#CCCCCC"> support</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> see that and we have</font>

959
00:35:38,010 --> 00:35:42,810
attacker compromises hospital network

960
00:35:40,020 --> 00:35:47,130
and periodically<font color="#CCCCCC"> reboots medical device</font>

961
00:35:42,810 --> 00:35:48,690
computers until ransom is paid TV right

962
00:35:47,130 --> 00:35:50,640
yeah it starts getting those these<font color="#CCCCCC"> one</font>

963
00:35:48,690 --> 00:35:53,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">started getting the TV</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I i don't know of</font>

964
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:54,690
any examples of this happening<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you</font>

965
00:35:53,220 --> 00:35:56,578
can certainly go down to these scenarios

966
00:35:54,690 --> 00:35:58,290
where you start talking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know</font>

967
00:35:56,579 --> 00:36:00,390
terrorism where you have a coordinated

968
00:35:58,290 --> 00:36:01,560
attack between kinetic attack and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then</font>

969
00:36:00,390 --> 00:36:03,839
messing with the hospital's medical

970
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:05,190
devices at the same time causing

971
00:36:03,839 --> 00:36:07,650
confusion these are all<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of the</font>

972
00:36:05,190 --> 00:36:11,430
wargaming type things right and<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

973
00:36:07,650 --> 00:36:12,720
make<font color="#CCCCCC"> potentially for good TV shows</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

974
00:36:11,430 --> 00:36:14,040
think it's something to consider when

975
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:16,799
you when<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> through this list</font>

976
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:18,480
of you know maybe today we have a

977
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:20,280
certain perspective on what that risk is

978
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:22,200
and maybe yesterday we had a certain

979
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:24,150
perspective on the impact of ransomware

980
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:26,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">on hospitals and how was that changed</font>

981
00:36:24,150 --> 00:36:28,260
over the past year<font color="#E5E5E5"> so many of these</font>

982
00:36:26,220 --> 00:36:30,270
scenarios that we think about<font color="#CCCCCC"> look like</font>

983
00:36:28,260 --> 00:36:31,589
TV shows today<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> their</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> number never</font>

984
00:36:30,270 --> 00:36:33,839
<font color="#E5E5E5">happened there too complicated there's</font>

985
00:36:31,589 --> 00:36:34,859
easier ways to get things done as it

986
00:36:33,839 --> 00:36:36,119
were

987
00:36:34,859 --> 00:36:37,799
it's certainly something to think about

988
00:36:36,119 --> 00:36:40,800
when you're doing your risk management

989
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:43,349
<font color="#E5E5E5">and I think the important point here too</font>

990
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:46,290
is that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know as</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> increasing the</font>

991
00:36:43,349 --> 00:36:48,990
use of technology and connectivity<font color="#CCCCCC"> when</font>

992
00:36:46,290 --> 00:36:50,730
providing patient care<font color="#CCCCCC"> right</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's going</font>

993
00:36:48,990 --> 00:36:51,598
like this<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're ramping up all these new</font>

994
00:36:50,730 --> 00:36:53,339
connected

995
00:36:51,599 --> 00:36:55,859
cool devices<font color="#CCCCCC"> that are improving patient</font>

996
00:36:53,339 --> 00:36:58,440
care<font color="#E5E5E5"> enabling people to respond more</font>

997
00:36:55,859 --> 00:37:00,509
quickly<font color="#CCCCCC"> at the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> same time are our</font>

998
00:36:58,440 --> 00:37:03,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">security resilience posture should not</font>

999
00:37:00,510 --> 00:37:05,490
be like this right<font color="#CCCCCC"> for increasing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> our</font>

1000
00:37:03,510 --> 00:37:07,020

1001
00:37:05,490 --> 00:37:12,209
be also increasing the security

1002
00:37:07,020 --> 00:37:15,000
assurances<font color="#E5E5E5"> so to be fair we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> talked a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> lot</font>

1003
00:37:12,210 --> 00:37:17,250
about these default<font color="#CCCCCC"> passwords so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> medical</font>

1004
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:19,470
device security is hard<font color="#E5E5E5"> and as</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

1005
00:37:17,250 --> 00:37:20,940
mentioned<font color="#CCCCCC"> i had done</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> custom EEG</font>

1006
00:37:19,470 --> 00:37:22,950
manufacturing so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I had first-hand</font>

1007
00:37:20,940 --> 00:37:23,790
experience with that<font color="#CCCCCC"> will</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get into this</font>

1008
00:37:22,950 --> 00:37:26,879
in a second

1009
00:37:23,790 --> 00:37:29,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">and so you have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to worry about secure</font>

1010
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:31,800
design and development so here's a child

1011
00:37:29,130 --> 00:37:33,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">labor</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I employed</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to build a custom</font>

1012
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:36,150
EEG machine<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this is me</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> age of</font>

1013
00:37:33,900 --> 00:37:39,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">12</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I think putting together a science</font>

00:37:36,150 --> 00:37:41,310
project<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> EEG</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and so certainly</font>

1015
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:42,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">understand how difficult it is to secure</font>

1016
00:37:41,310 --> 00:37:47,370
design and development

1017
00:37:42,810 --> 00:37:51,270
don't worry the voltage only goes one

1018
00:37:47,370 --> 00:37:54,450
way<font color="#CCCCCC"> that poor kid</font>

1019
00:37:51,270 --> 00:37:56,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">yeah look at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> rockin turtleneck</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to what</font>

1020
00:37:54,450 --> 00:37:59,730
happened<font color="#CCCCCC"> at</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> those are the nineties and</font>

1021
00:37:56,790 --> 00:38:01,529
secure implementation<font color="#CCCCCC"> right</font>

1022
00:37:59,730 --> 00:38:04,290
does<font color="#E5E5E5"> it get any more secure than das</font>

1023
00:38:01,530 --> 00:38:07,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">three-point Oh running on a headstart</font>

1024
00:38:04,290 --> 00:38:10,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">explorer and I don't think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

1025
00:38:07,350 --> 00:38:12,509
so in all seriousness<font color="#E5E5E5"> in terms of</font>

1026
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:15,120
treatment plans<font color="#CCCCCC"> so what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can we do about</font>

1027
00:38:12,510 --> 00:38:17,010
this going forward<font color="#E5E5E5"> so few different</font>

1028
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:19,140
things so first<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think this is part of</font>

1029
00:38:17,010 --> 00:38:21,210
the cavalry message as well as you know

1030
00:38:19,140 --> 00:38:23,370
it falls to all of us and patient safety

1031
00:38:21,210 --> 00:38:25,230
is not a spectator sport

1032
00:38:23,370 --> 00:38:27,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">so we talked about earlier all of us are</font>

1033
00:38:25,230 --> 00:38:28,800
going to be impacted by this<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is</font>

1034
00:38:27,810 --> 00:38:31,049
something that we all need to get

1035
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:32,580
involved with so even if today you may

1036
00:38:31,050 --> 00:38:34,740
have a certain expectation when you walk

1037
00:38:32,580 --> 00:38:37,590
into<font color="#CCCCCC"> hospital</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for a procedure that this</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">what are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> some of these devices that you</font>

1046
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,970
can look at in research<font color="#CCCCCC"> how can you get</font>

1047
00:38:52,710 --> 00:38:57,330
involved and help solving this problem

1048
00:38:53,970 --> 00:38:58,529
<font color="#E5E5E5">so importantly you know we have to have</font>

1049
00:38:57,330 --> 00:39:00,330
the stakeholders<font color="#E5E5E5"> understanding the</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">prerequisites you know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> as</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> mentioned</font>

before<font color="#E5E5E5"> our increase in implementation is</font>

1052
00:39:03,210 --> 00:39:07,770
is fairly rapid<font color="#CCCCCC"> do the stakeholders</font>

1053
00:39:06,420 --> 00:39:10,380
understand you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can't just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> plug something</font>

1054
00:39:07,770 --> 00:39:12,420
into a network that you can do that but

1055
00:39:10,380 --> 00:39:14,370
before that you probably should do some

1056
00:39:12,420 --> 00:39:15,810
other different things and how can get

1057
00:39:14,370 --> 00:39:18,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">people to talk together certainly</font>

1058
00:39:15,810 --> 00:39:19,830
important part of the treatment<font color="#E5E5E5"> engaging</font>

1059
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:21,060
with willing<font color="#E5E5E5"> allies where we overlap</font>

1060
00:39:19,830 --> 00:39:23,069

1061
00:39:21,060 --> 00:39:24,900
in everything but certainly this is a

1062
00:39:23,070 --> 00:39:26,610
big enough problem we can work with each

1063
00:39:24,900 --> 00:39:29,490
other to try and find a common solution

1064
00:39:26,610 --> 00:39:31,530
and also incorporating safety into

1065
00:39:29,490 --> 00:39:34,470
existing processes so how can we work to

they started to respond to us and

1237
00:45:44,779 --> 00:45:48,079
actually work through it and some of the

1238
00:45:46,069 --> 00:45:50,569

1244
00:45:56,989 --> 00:46:00,140
they had like a contact with them and so

1245
00:45:58,489 --> 00:46:02,779
they kind of started that<font color="#E5E5E5"> route and then</font>

now it does get<font color="#E5E5E5"> get get shared through</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

back when we weren't using any type of

<font color="#CCCCCC">that as well so that's there i think</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">with insulin pumps interesting is this</font>

1280
00:47:14,900 --> 00:47:18,559
our idea of artificial pancreas and kind

these systems in development that's

1283
00:47:20,150 --> 00:47:24,679
going to do a lot clinically for people

1284
00:47:22,549 --> 00:47:26,689
right<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> mean bottom line it's going to</font>

1285
00:47:24,679 --> 00:47:29,749
help a lot more people than<font color="#E5E5E5"> harms but</font>

1286
00:47:26,689 --> 00:47:32,209
the risks of that are you have the pump

1287
00:47:29,749 --> 00:47:34,069
<font color="#E5E5E5">talking to the glucose monitor talking</font>

1288
00:47:32,209 --> 00:47:36,198
to your smartphone and it's a full relay

1289
00:47:34,069 --> 00:47:37,759
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's taking that data integrity</font>

1290
00:47:36,199 --> 00:47:39,650
becomes an issue if you can compromise

1291
00:47:37,759 --> 00:47:42,319
that because the<font color="#E5E5E5"> system's automatically</font>

1292
00:47:39,650 --> 00:47:44,329
treating based on<font color="#CCCCCC"> you don't know I'm</font>

1296
00:47:48,739 --> 00:47:52,459
some point<font color="#CCCCCC"> way I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> mean you can think</font>

00:47:51,079 --> 00:47:54,140
about targeted attacks but<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think it's</font>

1298
00:47:52,459 --> 00:47:56,299
important to look at like that can

1299
00:47:54,140 --> 00:47:58,848
happen<font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm more concerned honestly</font>

1300
00:47:56,299 --> 00:48:00,410
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> unintentional consequences so how</font>

1301
00:47:58,849 --> 00:48:02,059
do we have low assurance because these

1302
00:48:00,410 --> 00:48:04,549
devices<font color="#E5E5E5"> lack</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of forensic</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> logging</font>

1303
00:48:02,059 --> 00:48:06,439

1304
00:48:04,549 --> 00:48:08,209
forensically sound evidence capture that

1305
00:48:06,439 --> 00:48:09,649
<font color="#CCCCCC">how do we know that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> malware that we sent</font>

1306

yes<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think that's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a good point of</font>

1345
00:49:35,369 --> 00:49:38,279
and the focus right now<font color="#CCCCCC"> even from the</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">FDA has been putting pressure on the</font>

1352

they secure these devices<font color="#E5E5E5"> but as we've</font>

00:49:47,940 --> 00:49:51,239
shown<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with that showed and stuff</font>

1354
00:49:49,289 --> 00:49:53,339
that was actually the hospital<font color="#E5E5E5"> swap for</font>

1355
00:49:51,239 --> 00:49:55,920
implementing it in an insecure fashion

1356
00:49:53,339 --> 00:49:57,450
so there's certain things that you need

1357
00:49:55,920 --> 00:49:59,039
to do things about so that concept like

1358
00:49:57,450 --> 00:50:00,569
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> i truly think that I said was a</font>

1359
00:49:59,039 --> 00:50:02,009
concept<font color="#E5E5E5"> of this was a software</font>

1360
00:50:00,569 --> 00:50:03,599
perspective but it was a building code

1361
00:50:02,009 --> 00:50:05,789
right<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I see something like that</font>

1362
00:50:03,599 --> 00:50:07,619
of almost<font color="#CCCCCC"> you have inspector regimes</font>

1363
00:50:05,789 --> 00:50:09,779
that going and specifically in a

1364
00:50:07,619 --> 00:50:11,009
hospital now<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you put electrical into</font>

1365
00:50:09,779 --> 00:50:12,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">know are there specific specifications</font>

1366
00:50:11,009 --> 00:50:14,009
you have to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> and there's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> an</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> aspect</font>

1367
00:50:12,180 --> 00:50:16,259
<font color="#E5E5E5">regime to do that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I see something like</font>

1368
00:50:14,009 --> 00:50:17,489
that on the provider side of securely

1369
00:50:16,259 --> 00:50:18,690
their secure design and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they're</font>

00:50:17,489 --> 00:50:19,469
<font color="#CCCCCC">secured employment that needs to be</font>

1371
00:50:18,690 --> 00:50:23,219
addressed

1372
00:50:19,469 --> 00:50:25,079
<font color="#CCCCCC">I got</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> two minutes left</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I guess</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hugely</font>

1373
00:50:23,219 --> 00:50:25,920
informative and an important<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm</font>

1374
00:50:25,079 --> 00:50:28,259
wondering if you've been following along

1375
00:50:25,920 --> 00:50:30,119
with<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with the sensor pills so like</font>

1376
00:50:28,259 --> 00:50:31,769
you said with<font color="#CCCCCC"> you yet i swallow and then</font>

1377
00:50:30,119 --> 00:50:34,019
imagine<font color="#CCCCCC"> swallowing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> or just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the roof was</font>

1378
00:50:31,769 --> 00:50:36,058
a<font color="#CCCCCC"> an anti-psychotic abilify which would</font>

1379
00:50:34,019 --> 00:50:37,828
be being used for force treatment<font color="#E5E5E5"> so on</font>

1380
00:50:36,059 --> 00:50:38,490
the flip side of this like when the

1381
00:50:37,829 --> 00:50:39,869
<font color="#E5E5E5">devices</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

1383
00:50:39,869 --> 00:50:42,630
patients have you been doing any

1384
00:50:41,070 --> 00:50:45,750
research to help protect the<font color="#E5E5E5"> patients</font>

1385
00:50:42,630 --> 00:50:47,550
from the devices not necessarily so like

1386
00:50:45,750 --> 00:50:49,590
some of those newer like prototype

1387
00:50:47,550 --> 00:50:51,150
devices like they're like ingestible so

1388
00:50:49,590 --> 00:50:52,500
like you<font color="#E5E5E5"> would digest them and then it</font>

1389
00:50:51,150 --> 00:50:55,260
would monitor something and then<font color="#CCCCCC"> I would</font>

1390
00:50:52,500 --> 00:50:58,170
typically<font color="#CCCCCC"> we'll talk</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> over like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Bluetooth</font>

1391
00:50:55,260 --> 00:50:59,970
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> to an app that then we'll treat</font>

1392
00:50:58,170 --> 00:51:02,220
you right or just<font color="#CCCCCC"> transmitted like</font>

00:50:59,970 --> 00:51:03,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">real-time data and so we haven't done a</font>

whole<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on those</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> kids a lot</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of them</font>

1395
00:51:03,600 --> 00:51:06,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">are actually like prototype devices that</font>

1396
00:51:05,580 --> 00:51:08,490
would be super expensive to get<font color="#CCCCCC"> ahold of</font>

1397
00:51:06,930 --> 00:51:10,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> episode we haven't had any like</font>

1398
00:51:08,490 --> 00:51:11,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">research universities to hey come check</font>

1399
00:51:10,410 --> 00:51:13,440
this device we're willing to let you

1400
00:51:11,700 --> 00:51:14,490
have it so<font color="#CCCCCC"> no we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have not but it's</font>

1401
00:51:13,440 --> 00:51:15,540
definitely an area of concern going

1402
00:51:14,490 --> 00:51:16,979
forward in it

1403
00:51:15,540 --> 00:51:19,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">I'm sorry to cut you off but we're</font>

00:51:16,980 --> 00:51:21,510
getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> shoved out here so if you have</font>

1405
00:51:19,980 --> 00:51:24,180
questions or want to talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> will try to</font>

00:51:21,510 --> 00:51:29,510
jump<font color="#CCCCCC"> your back on the hallway so thanks</font>
