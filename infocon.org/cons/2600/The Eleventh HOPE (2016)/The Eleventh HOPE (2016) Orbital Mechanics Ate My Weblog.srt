00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:08,930
polar region you should do it<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you can</font>

131
00:05:07,550 --> 00:05:10,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">get a job and they can pay you to go</font>

132
00:05:08,930 --> 00:05:13,490
there that's even better<font color="#CCCCCC"> they talk about</font>

00:05:10,730 --> 00:05:15,140
<font color="#CCCCCC">Antarctica is the first time you go you</font>

00:05:13,490 --> 00:05:16,190
go for the adventure<font color="#E5E5E5"> the second time you</font>

135
00:05:15,140 --> 00:05:17,659
go for the money

136
00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:19,160
the third time you go because you

137
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:21,170
realize there's nowhere else in the

138
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:23,420

139
00:05:21,170 --> 00:05:24,170
one of those cool special places in the

141
00:05:24,170 --> 00:05:28,010
alright so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> realized</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> had three</font>

what's depicted on the left there and a

00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:15,740
lot of stuff today now goes out on the

about the geosynchronous satellite in<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">geosynchronous orbit and when they see</font>

it they say geosynchronous it may not

necessarily be what you think it is

170
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:33,500
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> something can be synchronous and</font>

still not be right around<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">geographic or that celestial equator so</font>

173
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:42,469
it traces this kind of funky little

00:06:42,470 --> 00:06:53,060
looking for is a geostationary orbit and

176
00:06:46,490 --> 00:07:07,930
if i use my globe over here<font color="#CCCCCC"> and have to</font>

177
00:06:53,060 --> 00:07:09,310
put the microphone down for a sec

178
00:07:07,930 --> 00:07:10,870
that's about what you're looking at

179
00:07:09,310 --> 00:07:17,530
right so the satellite is going to be

180
00:07:10,870 --> 00:07:19,810
going around like this

181
00:07:17,530 --> 00:07:22,179
<font color="#CCCCCC">somebody</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get that later</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so</font>

182
00:07:19,810 --> 00:07:24,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">geostationary orbit you've got your</font>

183
00:07:22,180 --> 00:07:27,220
satellite that's out there and it stays

184
00:07:24,940 --> 00:07:29,770
over a spot on planet earth and it never

185
00:07:27,220 --> 00:07:31,389
really moves right<font color="#E5E5E5"> so to get coverage of</font>

186
00:07:29,770 --> 00:07:33,190
the entire planet you typically need a

187
00:07:31,389 --> 00:07:34,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">constellation</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of a minimum of three</font>

188
00:07:33,190 --> 00:07:36,789
satellites and this is a terrible

189
00:07:34,870 --> 00:07:38,860
picture because the satellites as we

190
00:07:36,789 --> 00:07:41,050
just saw<font color="#E5E5E5"> are not that close to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Planet</font>

one spot

193
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:47,770
one altitude that they can be<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is a</font>

194
00:07:45,639 --> 00:07:49,690
little bit better geometry<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what you</font>

195
00:07:47,770 --> 00:07:51,370

199
00:07:56,050 --> 00:07:59,289
there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem</font>

200
00:07:57,099 --> 00:08:00,520
this angle of elevation is great when

201
00:07:59,289 --> 00:08:03,039
you're looking at a satellite that's

202
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:04,840
basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> up at the zenith or down</font>

203
00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:06,759
towards the horizon<font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> when you get</font>

204
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:11,888
close to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> pole</font>

205
00:08:06,759 --> 00:08:13,750
look what happens<font color="#E5E5E5"> you draw this tangent</font>

206
00:08:11,889 --> 00:08:15,460
from where that satellite is the

207
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:17,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">line-of-sight right and you're standing</font>

208
00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:18,789
<font color="#E5E5E5">on the surface of the earth and you're</font>

209
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:23,960
looking out at the satellite at<font color="#CCCCCC"> zero</font>

210
00:08:18,789 --> 00:08:25,729
degrees

211
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:31,849
<font color="#E5E5E5">there's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> going to be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> little angle</font>

212
00:08:25,729 --> 00:08:34,189
<font color="#CCCCCC">and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if you trace</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that around there's a</font>

213
00:08:31,850 --> 00:08:36,110
dead zone

214
00:08:34,190 --> 00:08:37,580
no matter what you do you will never see

215
00:08:36,110 --> 00:08:39,800
that satellite if you're inside this

216
00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:42,169
little circle<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're inside 81 degrees</font>

217
00:08:39,799 --> 00:08:44,088
latitude<font color="#E5E5E5"> above or below</font>

218
00:08:42,169 --> 00:08:45,230
you're not going to see it<font color="#CCCCCC"> because it's</font>

219
00:08:44,089 --> 00:08:47,990
below the horizon

220
00:08:45,230 --> 00:08:51,200
well this is where i was going 77<font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font>

221
00:08:47,990 --> 00:08:54,620
let's take a look<font color="#CCCCCC"> there's a no-go zone</font>

222
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:57,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">that's where i'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm good to go</font>

223
00:08:54,620 --> 00:09:00,680
right

224
00:08:57,230 --> 00:09:02,089
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> 70 72 81 is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> degree</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> difference so</font>

225
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:04,459
there's a satellite that tracks the

226
00:09:02,089 --> 00:09:06,500
horizon and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's sitting there waiting</font>

227
00:09:04,459 --> 00:09:09,949
for me to send data<font color="#CCCCCC"> for degrees</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> above</font>

228
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:11,899
the horizon<font color="#CCCCCC"> you do not simply send data</font>

229
00:09:09,950 --> 00:09:15,140
to the satellite because guess what

230
00:09:11,899 --> 00:09:17,209
<font color="#CCCCCC">sending</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> up through the atmosphere you've</font>

231
00:09:15,140 --> 00:09:18,860
got minimum<font color="#CCCCCC"> attenuations like on a foggy</font>

232
00:09:17,209 --> 00:09:20,510
day you look up you can see the sky but

233
00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:22,459
you can't see anything out to the side

234
00:09:20,510 --> 00:09:25,010
and this is some of the problem<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

235
00:09:22,459 --> 00:09:27,439
atmospheric attenuation<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there's a</font>

236
00:09:25,010 --> 00:09:30,649
cool little graph that helps with this

237
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:33,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">right so if you're looking straight up</font>

238
00:09:30,649 --> 00:09:35,300
you usually pretty good<font color="#E5E5E5"> but where I was</font>

239
00:09:33,230 --> 00:09:37,160
at<font color="#CCCCCC"> four</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> degrees</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i start to get into this</font>

240
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:39,920
really bad zone where it starts to

241
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:42,860
absorb the signal<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> had to have to</font>

242
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:44,779
consider that but<font color="#CCCCCC"> i was still pretty</font>

243
00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:47,839
good right about four degrees anything

244
00:09:44,779 --> 00:09:50,029
less<font color="#E5E5E5"> or higher lower would have been bad</font>

245
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:51,260
so now there's access because guess what

246
00:09:50,029 --> 00:09:53,240
when you're on the ship there's always

247
00:09:51,260 --> 00:09:54,230
going to be an IT guy right<font color="#CCCCCC"> there</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font>

248
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:57,170

249
00:09:54,230 --> 00:10:00,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">want to be in charge that this was my IT</font>

thank you very much for what you do

00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:31,610
one email for the whole ship and all

265
00:10:29,779 --> 00:10:35,029
hundred guys had to write emails through

266
00:10:31,610 --> 00:10:36,770
that same system<font color="#CCCCCC"> the guy would print the</font>

267
00:10:35,029 --> 00:10:37,580
emails out and then distribute them so

268
00:10:36,770 --> 00:10:40,189
if you had something

269
00:10:37,580 --> 00:10:41,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">private from</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your spouse</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> no one else</font>

270
00:10:40,190 --> 00:10:45,500
would read it<font color="#E5E5E5"> except for the radio guy</font>

271
00:10:41,570 --> 00:10:47,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">and what do we have attachments</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> no</font>

272
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:49,250
attachments right<font color="#E5E5E5"> so we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> had to do</font>

273
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:53,120
everything<font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> text</font>

274
00:10:49,250 --> 00:10:58,220
thankfully i was using<font color="#CCCCCC"> Eudora</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> which used</font>

275
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:59,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">there it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is right</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> though Eudora and it</font>

276
00:10:58,220 --> 00:11:01,070
had you<font color="#CCCCCC"> you encode built</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in there are</font>

277
00:10:59,870 --> 00:11:02,480
different ways to take that but

278
00:11:01,070 --> 00:11:05,060
basically you would take an attachment

279
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:07,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">you would convert it into textual</font>

280
00:11:05,060 --> 00:11:08,959
characters like this and then your email

281
00:11:07,130 --> 00:11:10,760
program would pop it out the other side

282
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:13,130
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think my wife is watching the</font>

283
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:15,500
stream<font color="#CCCCCC"> so thank you very much for being</font>

284
00:11:13,130 --> 00:11:16,670
my minion<font color="#E5E5E5"> because of these attachments</font>

285
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:19,700
would come through and then she would

286
00:11:16,670 --> 00:11:20,270
upload them for me<font color="#E5E5E5"> if I if I couldn't do</font>

287
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:21,890
it

288
00:11:20,270 --> 00:11:23,480
course after<font color="#CCCCCC"> a while</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you know you make</font>

289
00:11:21,890 --> 00:11:27,170

00:12:50,769 --> 00:12:55,720
we could actually put stuff out there

00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:57,009
and do the uploads<font color="#CCCCCC"> so as</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> middle</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">you got solar you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> got wind and they did</font>

have a diesel<font color="#CCCCCC"> backup generator if they</font>

needed it but pretty much all<font color="#E5E5E5"> their</font>

electricity was done from right on site

and they had the microwave relay<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

374
00:14:42,730 --> 00:14:48,220
see just how large these domes are to

thing of course is content now this is a

they said we want more of that stuff so

450
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:45,700
I made him a special page<font color="#CCCCCC"> i also did a</font>

451
00:17:42,820 --> 00:17:48,040
couple panorama is a<font color="#CCCCCC"> quicktime vr just</font>

452
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:49,120
to test it out<font color="#E5E5E5"> these tiny little movies</font>

453
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:51,159
though right

454
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:53,169
so this is my chance to get a glass of

455
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:55,210
water i'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to show you a really</font>

00:17:53,170 --> 00:17:56,740
short video<font color="#CCCCCC"> of some penguins it is</font>

457
00:17:55,210 --> 00:17:59,560
simple water and if there's any

458
00:17:56,740 --> 00:18:29,789
questions about my first trip<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing</font>

459
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:31,859
satellite from deep ocean

460
00:18:29,789 --> 00:18:33,299
<font color="#E5E5E5">the comment was a question was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it were</font>

461
00:18:31,859 --> 00:18:35,189
<font color="#E5E5E5">shooting this from the helicopter that</font>

462
00:18:33,299 --> 00:18:37,109
was actually done from the bridge wing

463
00:18:35,190 --> 00:18:39,029
of the ship so looking down as the

464
00:18:37,109 --> 00:18:41,789
penguin was<font color="#E5E5E5"> coming through the lead</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">between the ship in the ice</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> watch it</font>

466
00:18:41,789 --> 00:18:44,609
<font color="#E5E5E5">again</font>

467
00:18:42,659 --> 00:18:46,559
alright so the Penguins they<font color="#E5E5E5"> they</font>

468
00:18:44,609 --> 00:18:48,029
<font color="#CCCCCC">flocked just like any group of birds</font>

469
00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:50,970
right there birds that flock together

470
00:18:48,029 --> 00:18:53,820
and they<font color="#E5E5E5"> know instinctually that</font>

471
00:18:50,970 --> 00:18:55,619
something is waiting to eat them<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so</font>

472
00:18:53,820 --> 00:18:57,210
they wait for the first one to go<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

473
00:18:55,619 --> 00:18:58,738
<font color="#E5E5E5">after the first one goes they figure</font>

474
00:18:57,210 --> 00:19:00,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">he's been eating so the rest of us can</font>

475
00:18:58,739 --> 00:19:03,269
go<font color="#E5E5E5"> and this is where they say if</font>

476
00:19:00,690 --> 00:19:04,739
penguins don't fly but they actually do

477
00:19:03,269 --> 00:19:06,210
fly they just<font color="#E5E5E5"> happened to fly in a</font>

478
00:19:04,739 --> 00:19:08,399
different fluid medium which is the

479
00:19:06,210 --> 00:19:12,059
water and<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're really graceful until</font>

480
00:19:08,399 --> 00:19:16,168
they get on land and then they just

481
00:19:12,059 --> 00:19:17,879
<font color="#CCCCCC">looked absolutely absurd so okay so my</font>

482
00:19:16,169 --> 00:19:20,489
second trip<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I think we're tracking</font>

483
00:19:17,879 --> 00:19:23,939
<font color="#CCCCCC">ok for time here i did this trip around</font>

484
00:19:20,489 --> 00:19:26,460
the world with my wife<font color="#CCCCCC"> after I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> retired</font>

485
00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:28,889
and we decided because<font color="#E5E5E5"> she had had</font>

486
00:19:26,460 --> 00:19:31,440
cancer<font color="#CCCCCC"> we could talk a little bit more</font>

487
00:19:28,889 --> 00:19:33,119
out about that offline<font color="#CCCCCC"> that it was time</font>

488
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:35,669
to move up some of our dreams and so we

489
00:19:33,119 --> 00:19:37,678
plotted this trip around the world we

490
00:19:35,669 --> 00:19:44,909
found a ship that would take us and we

491
00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:45,960
went on this<font color="#E5E5E5"> this trip here and we said</font>

492
00:19:44,909 --> 00:19:48,659
if we're going to do a trip of a

493
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:50,039
lifetime let's blog about it of course

494
00:19:48,659 --> 00:19:52,859
right<font color="#CCCCCC"> you got to get to the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ship and</font>

495
00:19:50,039 --> 00:19:54,149
then maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> we'll turn it into a book in</font>

496
00:19:52,859 --> 00:19:56,249
order<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do this you need satellite</font>

497
00:19:54,149 --> 00:19:59,998
internet so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i took a look at the price</font>

498
00:19:56,249 --> 00:20:01,739
and I was not happy because<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 25</font>

499
00:19:59,999 --> 00:20:05,789
cents a minute<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the cheapest plan</font>

500
00:20:01,739 --> 00:20:08,909
<font color="#E5E5E5">alright so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do the math</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font>

501
00:20:05,789 --> 00:20:11,009
<font color="#E5E5E5">to need to come up with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> $1,500 so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

502
00:20:08,909 --> 00:20:12,599
didn't have<font color="#CCCCCC"> $1,500</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> after i paid for</font>

503
00:20:11,009 --> 00:20:14,759
getting on a ship to go around the world

504
00:20:12,599 --> 00:20:16,499
<font color="#E5E5E5">we decided we're still going to do it</font>

505
00:20:14,759 --> 00:20:19,229
anyway so we went up on<font color="#CCCCCC"> Kickstarter</font>

506
00:20:16,499 --> 00:20:21,179
<font color="#E5E5E5">space right out here in Brooklyn anybody</font>

507
00:20:19,229 --> 00:20:23,249
ever done a<font color="#CCCCCC"> Kickstarter</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a couple</font>

508
00:20:21,179 --> 00:20:25,289
<font color="#CCCCCC">Kickstarter's in the room</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> fantastic</font>

509
00:20:23,249 --> 00:20:27,899
platform for creative projects but it

510
00:20:25,289 --> 00:20:30,149
has to be a creative project<font color="#E5E5E5"> so we did</font>

511
00:20:27,899 --> 00:20:32,340
it as a book<font color="#E5E5E5"> we put it up there with the</font>

512
00:20:30,149 --> 00:20:36,449
goal of<font color="#CCCCCC"> 3,000 we got funded by</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a hundred</font>

513
00:20:32,340 --> 00:20:39,238
<font color="#E5E5E5">fifty-three people so we were good to go</font>

514
00:20:36,450 --> 00:20:42,450
so if you look at that yellow line

515
00:20:39,239 --> 00:20:43,440
that's between 37 degrees south and<font color="#E5E5E5"> 62</font>

516
00:20:42,450 --> 00:20:46,019
degrees north

517
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:47,429
<font color="#E5E5E5">so we're good as far as geosynchronous</font>

518
00:20:46,019 --> 00:20:49,500
satellites don't have to worry about

519
00:20:47,429 --> 00:20:51,539
<font color="#CCCCCC">high-latitude</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i still have the</font>

520
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:54,659
same<font color="#E5E5E5"> three considerations so first of</font>

00:20:51,539 --> 00:20:57,870
all with<font color="#E5E5E5"> a signal</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> if you look back to</font>

00:20:57,870 --> 00:21:02,610
these little antennas<font color="#E5E5E5"> here</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they're</font>

00:21:02,610 --> 00:21:07,168
they're paired up<font color="#CCCCCC"> they do these things</font>

526
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:08,759
in pairs because of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> superstructure</font>

527
00:21:07,169 --> 00:21:10,470
when you get into those very extreme

528
00:21:08,759 --> 00:21:14,549
latitude so one of those is going to be

529
00:21:10,470 --> 00:21:15,600
masked by the<font color="#E5E5E5"> mast the stack right</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> but</font>

the<font color="#E5E5E5"> other one is still going to be able</font>

531
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:19,289
to see past it so even if this one's

looking at metal<font color="#CCCCCC"> the other one is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font>

these things<font color="#E5E5E5"> are massive massive</font>

satellite dishes that are in there<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

541
00:21:39,509 --> 00:21:42,899
also<font color="#E5E5E5"> like having a nice high quality</font>

543
00:21:42,899 --> 00:21:47,908
there's a guy back there<font color="#E5E5E5"> surfing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> his</font>

546
00:21:49,889 --> 00:21:54,539
just real quick you know technology<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

547
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:56,730
we've come so far ahead to go so far

548
00:21:54,539 --> 00:21:58,710
behind with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> sales and everything is</font>

549
00:21:56,730 --> 00:22:00,330
pretty amazing<font color="#CCCCCC"> travel around the world</font>

550
00:21:58,710 --> 00:22:01,649
you see some really cool technology and

551
00:22:00,330 --> 00:22:05,009
then of course with the k-band you can

552
00:22:01,649 --> 00:22:06,870
have a much smaller<font color="#CCCCCC"> antenna</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and so</font>

553
00:22:05,009 --> 00:22:09,419
here's a yacht we saw anchored out of

554
00:22:06,870 --> 00:22:11,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">monte carlo if you look</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> up the number on</font>

555
00:22:09,419 --> 00:22:14,820
the helicopter and the name of the yacht

556
00:22:11,850 --> 00:22:18,600
it's an interesting exercise so if you

557
00:22:14,820 --> 00:22:22,230
want to do that<font color="#CCCCCC"> November 145</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> likes your</font>

558
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:22,678

559
00:22:22,230 --> 00:22:24,990
out

560
00:22:22,679 --> 00:22:26,549
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you take a look they've got a whole</font>

561
00:22:24,990 --> 00:22:28,799
lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> carbs a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> little hard to see in</font>

562
00:22:26,549 --> 00:22:31,200
this picture<font color="#CCCCCC"> but they've got paired</font>

563
00:22:28,799 --> 00:22:32,668
<font color="#E5E5E5">satellite dishes here they've got a pair</font>

564
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:34,860
here they've got a single<font color="#CCCCCC"> here another</font>

565
00:22:32,669 --> 00:22:36,419
single here so<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're always going to</font>

566
00:22:34,860 --> 00:22:37,590
be in contact

567
00:22:36,419 --> 00:22:39,480
we talked about the plane of the

568
00:22:37,590 --> 00:22:42,750
ecliptic<font color="#E5E5E5"> right that's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> where the planet's</font>

570
00:22:42,750 --> 00:22:46,620
have this celestial equator celestial

571
00:22:44,639 --> 00:22:49,049
equator is where you're going to see all

572
00:22:46,620 --> 00:22:50,908
your geosynchronous satellites<font color="#CCCCCC"> is about</font>

573
00:22:49,049 --> 00:22:53,850
a year old but it's about the same they

574
00:22:50,909 --> 00:22:55,530
don't change much about 275 satellites

575
00:22:53,850 --> 00:22:57,540
are up right now

576
00:22:55,530 --> 00:22:59,879
<font color="#E5E5E5">and if you look this being the prime</font>

577
00:22:57,540 --> 00:23:02,220
meridian so this is over the UK right

578
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:04,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">coming</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> around</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> north america this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

00:23:02,220 --> 00:23:06,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">going to be up over india when</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you come</font>

580
00:23:04,710 --> 00:23:09,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">around all the way through</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Asia and then</font>

581
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:11,100
this empty spot is the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Pacific there's</font>

582
00:23:09,210 --> 00:23:13,980
not much going on out there<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

583
00:23:11,100 --> 00:23:16,260
talked about<font color="#E5E5E5"> three satellites make the</font>

584
00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:20,970
constellation<font color="#E5E5E5"> right hopefully you can</font>

585
00:23:16,260 --> 00:23:21,629
see that this is the area that a yep you

586
00:23:20,970 --> 00:23:27,240
got it

587
00:23:21,630 --> 00:23:29,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay so you got</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> three satellites minimum</font>

588
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:30,540
and in order to blanket most of the

589
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:34,050
planet

590
00:23:30,540 --> 00:23:35,879
<font color="#E5E5E5">I wish</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I had a better diagram here</font>

591
00:23:34,050 --> 00:23:39,870
because this shows that this is actually

592
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:42,960
a<font color="#CCCCCC"> three-axis if you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> look at it with the</font>

593
00:23:39,870 --> 00:23:44,189
<font color="#CCCCCC">z-axis</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> also those three lines but is</font>

594
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:46,530
another way to look at it thanks to

595
00:23:44,190 --> 00:23:47,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">inmarsat</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> right over the satellite you're</font>

596
00:23:46,530 --> 00:23:49,740
gonna have a great coverage and as you

597
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:52,110
get out to the edges<font color="#E5E5E5"> you as you would</font>

598
00:23:49,740 --> 00:23:54,030
imagine right so as<font color="#E5E5E5"> your angle of</font>

599
00:23:52,110 --> 00:23:55,889
elevation<font color="#E5E5E5"> decreases you're going to lose</font>

600
00:23:54,030 --> 00:23:58,830
some signal which is why they have the

601
00:23:55,890 --> 00:24:00,600
overlap areas and as we were cruising

602
00:23:58,830 --> 00:24:03,629
around the world we had<font color="#E5E5E5"> a for satellite</font>

603
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:05,879
constellation with<font color="#E5E5E5"> mr</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> set 3 and when</font>

604
00:24:03,630 --> 00:24:09,150
this came into play when this satellite

605
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:13,470
went down and i was in this area and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

606
00:24:09,150 --> 00:24:14,970
had<font color="#E5E5E5"> no internet basically from the</font>

607
00:24:13,470 --> 00:24:17,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">Arabian Gulf all the way through the Red</font>

608
00:24:14,970 --> 00:24:19,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">Sea because the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> fringe from the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> green</font>

609
00:24:17,910 --> 00:24:24,120
satellite wasn't getting it done in the

610
00:24:19,710 --> 00:24:26,490
blue satellite was down so there's my

611
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:31,320
signal access from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> ship's you sign</font>

612
00:24:26,490 --> 00:24:34,230
in and there's the fine print of course

613
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:35,790
with everything you do<font color="#E5E5E5"> they have to</font>

614
00:24:34,230 --> 00:24:38,610
point out<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> internet access from</font>

615
00:24:35,790 --> 00:24:40,080
ships is significantly slower

616
00:24:38,610 --> 00:24:42,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">I mean</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> folks in this room have no</font>

617
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:45,060
problem understanding that some people

618
00:24:42,330 --> 00:24:46,110
do and then they actually do some port

619
00:24:45,060 --> 00:24:48,300
blocking so you

620
00:24:46,110 --> 00:24:50,699
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> had no</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> YouTube we had no Facebook</font>

622
00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:54,840
generous with what they allowed up on

00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:56,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">there</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> there was a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> time when my</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> web site</font>

625
00:24:56,190 --> 00:25:00,780
here in a minute<font color="#E5E5E5"> so halfway into the</font>

at this point

631
00:25:08,850 --> 00:25:11,520
we already burned through<font color="#CCCCCC"> five hundred</font>

I was starting to burn through some of

these internet minutes with the

the ship is that there was actually a

little spike right about here because

653

this is when the crew got off work<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

so that was a signal so content i picked

659
00:26:23,679 --> 00:26:27,460
benefit here is that you put all your

easier

667
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:44,230
there's some advantages that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I see to</font>

668
00:26:41,289 --> 00:26:46,059
using a CMS specifically<font color="#CCCCCC"> wordpress</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> great</font>

669
00:26:44,230 --> 00:26:48,370
feature<font color="#E5E5E5"> because you don't have to be</font>

writing<font color="#E5E5E5"> your blog goes right up there</font>

674
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:57,580
and then you can log off and save some

675
00:26:56,950 --> 00:26:58,750
minutes

676
00:26:57,580 --> 00:27:01,870
there's also the ability to schedule

677
00:26:58,750 --> 00:27:05,200

683
00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:16,059

but why not make it beautiful

1057

1058
00:42:12,620 --> 00:42:16,310
difference as you build things it's ok
