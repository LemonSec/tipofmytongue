coordinated the activities in the lab so

that<font color="#CCCCCC"> i actually had an advantage being</font>

almost an academic environment where you

couldn't imagine being perceived as

people I was working around so it was it

00:08:41,559 --> 00:08:48,489
<font color="#E5E5E5">think through it was painful recognition</font>

00:08:45,670 --> 00:08:50,199
but<font color="#CCCCCC"> I eventually and then also followed</font>

my heart to a<font color="#CCCCCC"> role in information</font>

175
00:08:54,190 --> 00:09:00,880
time and I was just coincidental

176
00:08:56,230 --> 00:09:03,970
although<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i will say that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it did</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

177
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:05,950
think she appreciated me in a way that

00:09:03,970 --> 00:09:08,020
other managers of mine happen and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

179
00:09:05,950 --> 00:09:11,920
don't know it's hard to know what to

180
00:09:08,020 --> 00:09:13,120
contribute to being female versus what

to contribute to being you know a

182

do think that<font color="#CCCCCC"> this particular manager</font>

who<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually work for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for now</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> again you</font>

models<font color="#E5E5E5"> or mentors or sponsors provider</font>

191
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:45,100
having more women around allow you to

192
00:09:43,270 --> 00:09:49,270
increase the odds that you'll be

193

appreciated<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you are a woman just</font>

194
00:09:49,270 --> 00:09:53,800
because women do have shared experiences

00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:55,090
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> men don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> another</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> men have</font>

00:09:55,090 --> 00:09:59,560

a client one time and<font color="#CCCCCC"> it it was one of</font>

our longtime clients and we were in the

room and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're going to do a network</font>

looked around and started cracking up

326
00:15:31,819 --> 00:15:35,870
because we kind of find it comical that

327
00:15:34,190 --> 00:15:40,310
people still say these things these days

328
00:15:35,870 --> 00:15:42,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I think you're always gonna run into</font>

509
00:23:45,940 --> 00:23:53,320
think that's really great so I have to

510
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:55,300
agree with the social engineering aspect

511
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:58,990
of internal penetration tests when we

00:24:01,150 --> 00:24:04,210
call me and say so what are you doing

00:24:02,620 --> 00:24:08,379
today like what job are you on do you

516
00:24:04,210 --> 00:24:10,270
want to come help us out<font color="#E5E5E5"> because women</font>

517
00:24:08,380 --> 00:24:13,750
tend to have an advantage of getting in

00:24:10,270 --> 00:24:16,810
physical social engineering as well as

519
00:24:13,750 --> 00:24:19,420
some of our phone<font color="#CCCCCC"> plays as well</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but also</font>

00:24:16,810 --> 00:24:20,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">I think that internally at my company I</font>

521
00:24:19,420 --> 00:24:23,110
think that there's a lot more

522
00:24:20,260 --> 00:24:25,450
competition amongst the boys<font color="#CCCCCC"> so a lot of</font>

523
00:24:23,110 --> 00:24:28,240
times we call it hoarding<font color="#CCCCCC"> so when they</font>

00:24:25,450 --> 00:24:30,280
create new tools or you know discover

something new or new way in or whatever

00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:32,980
it may be

527
00:24:31,270 --> 00:24:36,550
they kind of keep it to themselves to

00:25:14,890 --> 00:25:20,620
or just go out and do a wine tasting and

545

<font color="#CCCCCC">I just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of enjoy that other advice</font>

from<font color="#E5E5E5"> women who otherwise wouldn't have</font>

685
00:31:40,309 --> 00:31:46,279
<font color="#E5E5E5">thought I feel we look at things in a</font>

00:31:48,259 --> 00:31:56,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">so that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of been my challenge so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

689
00:31:52,789 --> 00:31:58,249
also do not have any children<font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i have</font>

who works as many hours as<font color="#CCCCCC"> I do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so we've</font>

692
00:32:01,100 --> 00:32:07,459
we've really been making it work<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I</font>

693
00:32:04,309 --> 00:32:10,100
think I feel like things will probably

694
00:32:07,460 --> 00:32:12,559
change when<font color="#E5E5E5"> I do decide to have kids but</font>

695
00:32:10,100 --> 00:32:14,869
luckily<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there's a push to</font>

696
00:32:12,559 --> 00:32:16,220
keep women in the workforce<font color="#CCCCCC"> so there's a</font>

697
00:32:14,869 --> 00:32:18,230
lot of flexible working arrangements

698
00:32:16,220 --> 00:32:23,149
that a lot of companies are willing to

699
00:32:18,230 --> 00:32:25,519
offer<font color="#CCCCCC"> so that we can stay working and</font>

700
00:32:23,149 --> 00:32:28,668
still have a family<font color="#CCCCCC"> so looking forward</font>

701
00:32:25,519 --> 00:32:31,279

702
00:32:28,669 --> 00:32:34,460
learn because as we all know security is

703
00:32:31,279 --> 00:32:39,139
<font color="#CCCCCC">ever-changing so can't really afford to</font>

704
00:32:34,460 --> 00:32:43,580
sit back and<font color="#E5E5E5"> no keep learning</font>

lot of old white dudes who make bad

779
00:35:58,450 --> 00:36:02,230
decisions because there's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> homogeneous</font>

780

perspective in that room<font color="#E5E5E5"> right like that</font>

781
00:36:02,230 --> 00:36:04,780
is what is causing a lot of stuff to not

00:38:44,150 --> 00:38:49,460
like talk about things in a more casual

841
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:54,740
environment and sometimes you can have

842
00:38:49,460 --> 00:38:56,210
some great ideas<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> whitetail hey</font>

846
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:07,189
<font color="#E5E5E5">are asked to unfairly represent</font>

847
00:39:04,970 --> 00:39:08,839
something on behalf of all women<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

848
00:39:07,190 --> 00:39:10,850
maybe even<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the expense of your own</font>

849
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:14,150
personal experience or just in general

850
00:39:10,850 --> 00:39:18,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">you know that sort of thing</font>

851
00:39:14,150 --> 00:39:22,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">yeah I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i was I'm always hesitant to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sign</font>

852
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:24,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">up for women and security anything there</font>

853
00:39:22,220 --> 00:39:25,950
was actually an article on<font color="#CCCCCC"> hacker news</font>

854
00:39:24,210 --> 00:39:30,330
not that long ago saying why I'll never

855
00:39:25,950 --> 00:39:31,980
do women<font color="#CCCCCC"> insecurity talk and it was</font>

856
00:39:30,330 --> 00:39:34,589
interesting<font color="#CCCCCC"> because you never want to be</font>

857
00:39:31,980 --> 00:39:36,599
that token person<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> always want to be</font>

858
00:39:34,589 --> 00:39:39,119
viewed as someone who knows<font color="#E5E5E5"> security a</font>

859
00:39:36,599 --> 00:39:42,930
technician as someone with analysis and

860
00:39:39,119 --> 00:39:46,109
things to offer<font color="#CCCCCC"> not as a female</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

861
00:39:42,930 --> 00:39:47,940
also<font color="#E5E5E5"> feel that women</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> kind of need to</font>

862
00:39:46,109 --> 00:39:49,259
come together and we can kind of be more

863
00:39:47,940 --> 00:39:51,660
powerful together and so there's that

864
00:39:49,260 --> 00:39:54,180
kind of lack of voice and so someone has

865
00:39:51,660 --> 00:39:57,420
to do it and and hopefully we won't be

866
00:39:54,180 --> 00:39:59,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">tokenized but there's always that risk</font>

867
00:39:57,420 --> 00:40:04,530
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I don't we all try to avoid that as</font>

868
00:39:59,190 --> 00:40:09,119
well<font color="#CCCCCC"> I have to agree with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Renee I'm</font>

869
00:40:04,530 --> 00:40:11,700
always hesitant as well however<font color="#CCCCCC"> I guess</font>

870
00:40:09,119 --> 00:40:14,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">without us doing things like this it's</font>

871
00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:17,220
not going to attract a lot of women to

872
00:40:14,220 --> 00:40:19,589
join to join us<font color="#E5E5E5"> because I i think that</font>

873
00:40:17,220 --> 00:40:21,868
the thought of being an<font color="#CCCCCC"> nit or</font>

874
00:40:19,589 --> 00:40:24,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">insecurity</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> never really crossed my mind</font>

875
00:40:21,869 --> 00:40:28,500
growing up<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think nowadays it's more so</font>

876
00:40:24,990 --> 00:40:30,118
than when<font color="#CCCCCC"> I was younger but I never even</font>

877
00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:32,520
thought of that for a second

878
00:40:30,119 --> 00:40:35,400
it wasn't until you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> Tom stepped</font>

879
00:40:32,520 --> 00:40:36,839
<font color="#E5E5E5">into the office that I worked in and</font>

880
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:38,820
kind of brought it up that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I would</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was</font>

881
00:40:36,839 --> 00:40:42,240
even like wow like this is so

882
00:40:38,820 --> 00:40:45,690
interesting<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I think that without you</font>

883
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:47,520
know sharing our experiences<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're not</font>

884
00:40:45,690 --> 00:40:49,410
going to get as many women to be

885
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:51,089

00:49:49,930 --> 00:49:55,540
twofold at<font color="#E5E5E5"> it sounds like all of you</font>

how would what would you say is the best

1086
00:50:08,150 --> 00:50:14,749
way to get more women and intact whether
