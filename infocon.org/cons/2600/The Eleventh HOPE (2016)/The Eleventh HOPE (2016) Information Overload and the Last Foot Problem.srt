00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">thank you for that kind introduction so</font>

2
00:00:03,149 --> 00:00:06,569
we're gonna talk about a bunch of things

3
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:08,610
here and at the end we'll talk a bit

4
00:00:06,569 --> 00:00:14,219
about what it is we're doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> and in</font>

5
00:00:08,610 --> 00:00:15,928
particular<font color="#E5E5E5"> but we're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> gonna</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> start off</font>

6
00:00:14,219 --> 00:00:18,448
just talking generally about information

7
00:00:15,929 --> 00:00:20,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">overload right so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> there's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like way too</font>

8
00:00:18,449 --> 00:00:23,340
much stuff to read<font color="#E5E5E5"> not enough time to</font>

9
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:25,170
read it in and we have basically a last

10
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:27,900
foot problem<font color="#CCCCCC"> and as you pointed out</font>

11
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:30,480
we're not talking about feet foot<font color="#CCCCCC"> talk</font>

12
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:34,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">about getting it from here into here</font>

13
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:36,149
<font color="#CCCCCC">that's the bottleneck and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we'll talk</font>

14
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:38,610
about sort of historically how text has

15
00:00:36,149 --> 00:00:39,989
changed over time to be more efficient

16
00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:42,149
for the particular media that<font color="#CCCCCC"> were</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> using</font>

17
00:00:39,989 --> 00:00:43,589
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> read</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ian and how</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we've transitioned</font>

18
00:00:42,149 --> 00:00:45,300
<font color="#CCCCCC">to screens and have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> those unique</font>

19
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:47,579
challenges and opportunities associated

20
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:49,680
with reading on-screen and some of the

21
00:00:47,579 --> 00:00:51,270
new technologies that are working to

22
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:53,370
make it more efficient to read

23
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:57,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">especially now because we have so much</font>

24
00:00:53,370 --> 00:00:58,468
stuff to read<font color="#E5E5E5"> so if you're like a lot of</font>

25
00:00:57,270 --> 00:01:04,320
us you wake up something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that looks like</font>

26
00:00:58,469 --> 00:01:09,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">this evening hope</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we're not about to</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">once again midnight tonight in the know</font>

31
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:19,259
the room right over that way

32
00:01:17,009 --> 00:01:20,610
hackers got talent<font color="#E5E5E5"> whether you want to</font>

33
00:01:19,259 --> 00:01:22,500
just spectate or whether you want to be

part of it and take a<font color="#CCCCCC"> five-minute / to</font>

00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:26,729
present<font color="#E5E5E5"> us some talent that you have</font>

36
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:28,740
with some kind of hacker flavor to it

37
00:01:26,729 --> 00:01:31,350
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> that means I leave up to you</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">sign-ups a might be still happening in</font>

00:01:31,350 --> 00:01:34,860
the info desk or just show up there

40
00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:39,360
might be some slots left

41
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:44,399
<font color="#CCCCCC">alright we ok so information overload</font>

42
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:45,960
has ended<font color="#CCCCCC"> so we all we all wake up</font>

43
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:47,640
<font color="#CCCCCC">something</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> looks like this you know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

44
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:50,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">got tons of email to read and you got</font>

45
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:52,950
news to catch up on and all of this and

46
00:01:50,970 --> 00:01:55,829
you know unfortunately humans are

47
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:58,920
actually not naturally good at reading

48
00:01:55,829 --> 00:02:01,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">and if you look back historically like</font>

49
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:03,000
we're really good at talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> we've</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> been</font>

50
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:05,189
talking for a long time<font color="#E5E5E5"> humans</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we talked</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">for about a hundred thousand years and</font>

00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:15,329
to teach it<font color="#CCCCCC"> just happens because</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we're</font>

56
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:18,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">hardwired for language we are not</font>

57
00:02:15,330 --> 00:02:20,190
hardwired for reading and writing and

58
00:02:18,270 --> 00:02:22,170
we've only been doing it for about<font color="#E5E5E5"> 5,000</font>

59
00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:24,060
years and it would probably surprised

60
00:02:22,170 --> 00:02:26,670
most<font color="#E5E5E5"> people in this room who speak</font>

61
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:29,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">english and other common languages to</font>

62
00:02:26,670 --> 00:02:31,140
know that<font color="#CCCCCC"> 75-percent of languages even</font>

63
00:02:29,070 --> 00:02:34,620
in existence today have no written

64
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:35,730
component<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this is like no no writing</font>

65
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:38,520
associated with it because we're not

66
00:02:35,730 --> 00:02:39,959
hardwired for reading and writing<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

67
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:41,790
one of the things that follows from the

68
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:44,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">sort of short history of reading and</font>

69
00:02:41,790 --> 00:02:46,769
writing is that<font color="#CCCCCC"> 5,000 years is not long</font>

70
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:50,070
enough for us to have evolved<font color="#E5E5E5"> or to have</font>

71
00:02:46,770 --> 00:02:52,950
like you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know evolutionary pressure to</font>

72
00:02:50,070 --> 00:02:55,620
select<font color="#E5E5E5"> for good reading ability so we</font>

73
00:02:52,950 --> 00:02:58,410
just kind of existed<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you came with</font>

74
00:02:55,620 --> 00:03:00,060
whatever reading ability you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

75
00:02:58,410 --> 00:03:02,310
then we created reading and writing and

76
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:04,320
there's a large diversity in reading

77
00:03:02,310 --> 00:03:06,090
ability for various reasons both

78
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:09,510
visually and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then and cognitively as</font>

79
00:03:06,090 --> 00:03:11,070
well so as<font color="#E5E5E5"> one neuro-linker slice to say</font>

80
00:03:09,510 --> 00:03:14,070
humans didn't evolve to be efficient

81
00:03:11,070 --> 00:03:16,440
readers<font color="#E5E5E5"> rather are writing system has</font>

82
00:03:14,070 --> 00:03:18,090
evolved to be good for the hardware<font color="#E5E5E5"> up</font>

83
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:21,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">here that we have that we came with</font>

84
00:03:18,090 --> 00:03:24,090
zooming in a bit on the the writing

85
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:26,220
portion<font color="#CCCCCC"> will take a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> brief look at sort</font>

86
00:03:24,090 --> 00:03:28,200
of how things have evolved and then how

87
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:30,690
the writing systems have been efficient

88
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:32,640
<font color="#CCCCCC">44</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> how</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> has</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> been writing and and then</font>

89
00:03:30,690 --> 00:03:33,750
also looking at the things today and how

90
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:35,760
we can make<font color="#E5E5E5"> it more efficient for that</font>

91
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:37,140
<font color="#CCCCCC">so we started with pictographs</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that's</font>

92
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:38,820
like stuff that looks like things in the

93
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:40,859
real world so<font color="#E5E5E5"> a dog looks like a dog</font>

94
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:42,269
that was great because<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font>

95
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:44,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">efficient because you know what is</font>

96
00:03:42,270 --> 00:03:47,460
referring to<font color="#CCCCCC"> you have a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> limited sort of</font>

97
00:03:44,490 --> 00:03:48,180
vocabulary<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> moved to alphabets a long</font>

98
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:50,400
time ago

99
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:52,650
those are great because it takes a lot

100
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:55,800
less time to become literate<font color="#CCCCCC"> if you're</font>

101
00:03:52,650 --> 00:03:57,870
in an alphabet<font color="#E5E5E5"> culture back way back</font>

102
00:03:55,800 --> 00:04:00,090
when you know people were like farmers

103
00:03:57,870 --> 00:04:01,710
and stuff and it would take years and

104
00:04:00,090 --> 00:04:03,150
years and years of dedicated study to

105
00:04:01,710 --> 00:04:06,210
learn all the thousands and thousands

106
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:08,370
and thousands of pictographs<font color="#E5E5E5"> so most</font>

107
00:04:06,210 --> 00:04:09,690
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> were not literate when alphabets</font>

108
00:04:08,370 --> 00:04:11,670
came around you know you've got roughly

109
00:04:09,690 --> 00:04:14,430
30 characters to memorize and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

110
00:04:11,670 --> 00:04:16,440
<font color="#CCCCCC">associated with sounds and then</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's a</font>

111
00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:17,700
lot quicker to be able to be literate

112
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:19,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">because you just have to know what</font>

113
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:20,279
sounds<font color="#E5E5E5"> correspond with what</font>

114
00:04:19,290 --> 00:04:22,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">hours and then you can sort of piece</font>

115
00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:24,179
things together so the alphabet was

116
00:04:22,230 --> 00:04:26,070
great in terms of democratizing literacy

117
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:30,330
and getting a lot more people to be able

118
00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:32,370
to read<font color="#CCCCCC"> next</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> came the printing press and</font>

119
00:04:30,330 --> 00:04:34,530
around<font color="#CCCCCC"> 1400 this is great obviously</font>

120
00:04:32,370 --> 00:04:37,290
because it makes printing a lot less

121
00:04:34,530 --> 00:04:38,099
expensive<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't have hand described</font>

122
00:04:37,290 --> 00:04:39,990
books

123
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:42,180
it enables things like<font color="#CCCCCC"> newspapers so</font>

124
00:04:39,990 --> 00:04:45,240
again really broadening the circle of

125
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:47,220
the number of people who can read and

126
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:49,500
then lastly<font color="#CCCCCC"> digitization came about much</font>

127
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:50,880
more recently and this<font color="#CCCCCC"> broads even</font>

128
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:52,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">further because instead of having to</font>

129
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:54,960
print a million newspapers and<font color="#E5E5E5"> ship them</font>

130
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:56,700
around the world we have a website and a

131
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:58,890
million people from all over can look at

132
00:04:56,700 --> 00:05:00,750
it at the same time<font color="#E5E5E5"> so again lowering</font>

133
00:04:58,890 --> 00:05:02,669
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> cost of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> coming literate and</font>

134
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:05,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">broadening the circle of the people who</font>

135
00:05:02,670 --> 00:05:07,470
are literate<font color="#CCCCCC"> so these are all great</font>

136
00:05:05,370 --> 00:05:08,790
developments because they bring reading

137
00:05:07,470 --> 00:05:11,550
to the masses but they also brought

138
00:05:08,790 --> 00:05:13,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">massive amounts of reading because now</font>

139
00:05:11,550 --> 00:05:14,940
everybody can read and write and you

140
00:05:13,590 --> 00:05:16,320
know your boss can send you an<font color="#CCCCCC"> email and</font>

141
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:17,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">your friend can send you an article and</font>

142
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:19,349
<font color="#E5E5E5">say hey look at this</font>

143
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:23,039
<font color="#E5E5E5">so there's just a lot more stuff to read</font>

144
00:05:19,350 --> 00:05:25,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">looking briefly at the media in which we</font>

145
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:28,860
read we start out with tablet<font color="#E5E5E5"> things not</font>

146
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:29,940
the kind of<font color="#CCCCCC"> tablet</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we have today and</font>

147
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:31,320
then we moved<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to the Pirates and</font>

148
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:32,850
paper and then recently we have

149
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:35,580
different kinds of screens and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> broken</font>

150
00:05:32,850 --> 00:05:37,710
out<font color="#CCCCCC"> smartphones here because as you'll</font>

151
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:39,690
see that the difference<font color="#CCCCCC"> form-factor size</font>

152
00:05:37,710 --> 00:05:42,570
has different advantages and

153
00:05:39,690 --> 00:05:44,190
disadvantages<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so as we optimize the</font>

154
00:05:42,570 --> 00:05:45,840
way we read and write for different

155
00:05:44,190 --> 00:05:50,640
types of screens the size is actually

156
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:53,760
relevant<font color="#E5E5E5"> so here's here's one example of</font>

157
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:55,289
how we've we've evolved<font color="#E5E5E5"> reading and</font>

158
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:58,289
writing to be efficient for the medium

159
00:05:55,290 --> 00:06:00,120
that were using<font color="#CCCCCC"> so early Latin is on the</font>

160
00:05:58,290 --> 00:06:02,190
top line and then we've got the modern

161
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:05,610
equivalent on the bottom<font color="#CCCCCC"> if you're like</font>

162
00:06:02,190 --> 00:06:06,930
most people you prefer the bottom you

163
00:06:05,610 --> 00:06:08,520
might<font color="#E5E5E5"> feel differently if you are</font>

164
00:06:06,930 --> 00:06:11,340
holding a chisel in your hand and you

165
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:13,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">had to carve into stone because straight</font>

166
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:16,500
lines are a lot easier to chisel<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

167
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:17,640
<font color="#CCCCCC">curved lines so that was why I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was one</font>

168
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:22,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">of the reasons why we had so many</font>

169
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:23,969
straight lines in<font color="#E5E5E5"> old old languages but</font>

170
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:26,460
it turns out that as we moved away from

171
00:06:23,970 --> 00:06:28,680
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> carving stuff in stone and you</font>

172
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:30,780
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> catching it into clay tablets that</font>

173
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:31,920
we have this this modern alphabet that

174
00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:34,260
looks different and

175
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:36,420
reason is<font color="#E5E5E5"> because if you can do curves</font>

176
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:38,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">you can have more unique shapes and when</font>

177
00:06:36,420 --> 00:06:40,650
you have unique shapes<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's easier for</font>

178
00:06:38,130 --> 00:06:42,570
your brain to quickly identify<font color="#CCCCCC"> oh well</font>

179
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:45,479
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's a letter B think of the letter B</font>

180
00:06:42,570 --> 00:06:47,580
and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> number-8 no capital B</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if you</font>

181
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:48,960
could only do straight lines those are

182
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:52,260
identical you can't have those two

183
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:55,020
things in the same alphabet<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so we've</font>

184
00:06:52,260 --> 00:06:56,849
moved<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> past the early Latin type</font>

185
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:58,919
stuff and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have a more efficient way</font>

186
00:06:56,850 --> 00:07:00,720
of writing<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> been enabled by the</font>

187
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:04,920
fact that were no longer<font color="#E5E5E5"> carving stuff</font>

188
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:07,200
into stone<font color="#E5E5E5"> a much more modern example is</font>

189
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:08,250
clear type so I want to ask

190
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:11,340
raise your<font color="#E5E5E5"> hand if you know what</font>

191
00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:13,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">cleartype is I'm really curious ok so</font>

192
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:15,239
maybe<font color="#CCCCCC"> like a quarter of people or fifth</font>

193
00:07:13,260 --> 00:07:16,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">cleartype is something that we've all</font>

194
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:19,230
seen like thousands and thousands of

195
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:22,230
times<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's made</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> by a little company</font>

196
00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:24,360
called<font color="#CCCCCC"> microsoft and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a microsoft</font>

197
00:07:22,230 --> 00:07:27,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">word and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's a way of displaying text</font>

198
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:28,350
that makes it<font color="#CCCCCC"> a crisper</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> appear crisper</font>

199
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:33,450
<font color="#CCCCCC">on-screen</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it uses what's called</font>

200
00:07:28,350 --> 00:07:37,170
sub-pixel rendering<font color="#CCCCCC"> so these</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> nine</font>

201
00:07:33,450 --> 00:07:41,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">pixels composed of 27</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> subpixels</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> r g and</font>

202
00:07:37,170 --> 00:07:41,760
b<font color="#E5E5E5"> and normally when you render things on</font>

203
00:07:41,190 --> 00:07:43,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">a screen</font>

204
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:44,490
you just you know turn it on or off

205
00:07:43,170 --> 00:07:46,770
depending on what color you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font>

206
00:07:44,490 --> 00:07:49,440
with sub-pixel rendering you actually

207
00:07:46,770 --> 00:07:51,419
turn on you know that the edge of a

208
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:53,160
pixel<font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you can make a line appear</font>

209
00:07:51,420 --> 00:07:55,500
smoother so like the sea<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> cleartype</font>

210
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:58,050
might appear jagged<font color="#CCCCCC"> if you have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to lower</font>

211
00:07:55,500 --> 00:08:01,350
resolution and so you've got a

212
00:07:58,050 --> 00:08:03,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">side-by-side here on your right and on</font>

213
00:08:01,350 --> 00:08:05,340
the far right is the the<font color="#CCCCCC"> sub-pixel</font>

214
00:08:03,090 --> 00:08:07,409
rendered version<font color="#E5E5E5"> zoom it out you can see</font>

215
00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:10,950
a little bit more easily how how<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

216
00:08:07,410 --> 00:08:14,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">clearer</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> than the stepwise version on the</font>

217
00:08:10,950 --> 00:08:16,200
left here is what text looks like real

218
00:08:14,610 --> 00:08:18,570
zoomed in so you can see there's a lot

219
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:22,740
of color<font color="#E5E5E5"> there but then when you zoom it</font>

220
00:08:18,570 --> 00:08:25,500
out<font color="#E5E5E5"> it just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> kinda looks black so clear</font>

221
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:27,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">type is interesting because you know</font>

222
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:30,240
when we<font color="#CCCCCC"> moved to LCD screens we have</font>

223
00:08:27,570 --> 00:08:31,469
this issue because things appear jagged

224
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:32,909
and some people think that makes it

225
00:08:31,470 --> 00:08:35,729
harder to read some people just think

226
00:08:32,909 --> 00:08:38,309
it's ugly<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so people came up with a</font>

227
00:08:35,729 --> 00:08:42,060
solution to use sub-pixel rendering and

228
00:08:38,309 --> 00:08:43,968
color to make it easier to read<font color="#E5E5E5"> but in</font>

229
00:08:42,059 --> 00:08:45,469
<font color="#CCCCCC">2013</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> or with</font>

230
00:08:43,969 --> 00:08:47,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">word 2013 which I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't know what that</font>

231
00:08:45,470 --> 00:08:49,399
actually came out<font color="#CCCCCC"> microsoft away with it</font>

232
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:50,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">and you know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that's that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> probably</font>

233
00:08:49,399 --> 00:08:52,550
because we now have much higher

234
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:56,120
resolution<font color="#E5E5E5"> screens and so we don't need</font>

235
00:08:52,550 --> 00:08:59,479
to use this as a tool to make<font color="#CCCCCC"> text</font>

236
00:08:56,120 --> 00:09:01,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">crisper because</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> text is just whisper so</font>

237
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:04,430
these are a couple of ways in which we

238
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:07,250
have done a good job of making reading

239
00:09:04,430 --> 00:09:10,189
on screens<font color="#E5E5E5"> efficient for reading on</font>

240
00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:11,660
screens<font color="#E5E5E5"> but in a lot of ways we have not</font>

241
00:09:10,189 --> 00:09:13,160
done a good job<font color="#CCCCCC"> with this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and a lot of</font>

242
00:09:11,660 --> 00:09:16,160
ways we basically just took the user

243
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:17,959
interface for paper and said hey let's

244
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:20,180
put that on a tablet let's like make a

245
00:09:17,959 --> 00:09:25,609
tablet a window<font color="#E5E5E5"> for piece of paper and</font>

246
00:09:20,180 --> 00:09:28,729
we just make it but if you've ever seen

247
00:09:25,610 --> 00:09:30,949
a news website that<font color="#CCCCCC"> look like this you</font>

248
00:09:28,730 --> 00:09:32,930
know that's not always a good idea<font color="#E5E5E5"> right</font>

249
00:09:30,949 --> 00:09:35,359
<font color="#E5E5E5">so it's got like a zoo me thing and then</font>

250
00:09:32,930 --> 00:09:39,888
you're dragging around and you can zoom

251
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:42,410
out<font color="#CCCCCC"> but it doesn't actually I try to</font>

252
00:09:39,889 --> 00:09:44,899
<font color="#CCCCCC">zoom</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at this is the mercury news in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> san</font>

253
00:09:42,410 --> 00:09:46,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">jose</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and like the zoom out didn't even</font>

254
00:09:44,899 --> 00:09:48,769
work<font color="#CCCCCC"> and what's really interesting is</font>

255
00:09:46,850 --> 00:09:52,730
you actually pay extra for this feature

256
00:09:48,769 --> 00:09:55,519
the e-edition<font color="#CCCCCC"> they charge for this so</font>

257
00:09:52,730 --> 00:09:58,370
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is one really obvious example of a</font>

258
00:09:55,519 --> 00:10:01,879
way in which we need to adapt from paper

259
00:09:58,370 --> 00:10:03,949
to screen and most newspapers don't have

260
00:10:01,879 --> 00:10:05,600
this anymore<font color="#E5E5E5"> for the websites</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they have</font>

261
00:10:03,949 --> 00:10:07,758
a mobile version<font color="#E5E5E5"> but there are things</font>

262
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:11,990
that are a lot more subtle than<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

263
00:10:07,759 --> 00:10:15,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">Donald Trump is not one of the subtle</font>

264
00:10:11,990 --> 00:10:18,829
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> so let's focus here on these</font>

265
00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:22,309
these first couple paragraphs<font color="#CCCCCC"> so this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

266
00:10:18,829 --> 00:10:23,899
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> screenshot from a computer and the</font>

267
00:10:22,309 --> 00:10:25,309
first paragraph<font color="#E5E5E5"> is three lines long and</font>

268
00:10:23,899 --> 00:10:29,120
the second paragraph<font color="#CCCCCC"> is four lines long</font>

00:10:25,309 --> 00:10:30,949
<font color="#CCCCCC">open up on a phone</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> instead of three</font>

270
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:33,829
lines at six and<font color="#CCCCCC"> instead of four lines</font>

271
00:10:30,949 --> 00:10:35,839
<font color="#CCCCCC">it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> nine now you might wonder why does</font>

same number of words in the same order

274
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:41,389
to explain why that matters

275
00:10:39,829 --> 00:10:43,939
<font color="#CCCCCC">we'll take</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a brief look at how your</font>

276
00:10:41,389 --> 00:10:45,199
visual processing system works<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have</font>

277
00:10:43,939 --> 00:10:47,480
in the center what's called the fovea

278
00:10:45,199 --> 00:10:51,649
which is one-and-a-half to two degrees

279
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:53,509
of your visual field<font color="#E5E5E5"> then you have a</font>

280
00:10:51,649 --> 00:10:55,819
<font color="#CCCCCC">pair</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> fovea outside of that that's about</font>

281
00:10:53,509 --> 00:10:56,940
8 degrees total and then outside of that

282
00:10:55,819 --> 00:11:00,000
is a peripheral<font color="#E5E5E5"> vision</font>

283
00:10:56,940 --> 00:11:01,410
she probably heard of and not surprising

284
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,930
the fovea is where you have the most

285
00:11:01,410 --> 00:11:07,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">acuity and then the pair fovea</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> less so</font>

286
00:11:03,930 --> 00:11:09,329
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the periphery even less than that so</font>

287
00:11:07,230 --> 00:11:11,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">the reason that matters is when you're</font>

288
00:11:09,330 --> 00:11:13,050
reading on the computer screen up top

289

<font color="#CCCCCC">here's a paragraph that second one with</font>

these visual guides in the bottom

302
00:11:37,890 --> 00:11:42,960
version this is nine lines long

303
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:44,070
it's much harder for you to see the top

304
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:46,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">and the bottom of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> paragraph when you're</font>

306
00:11:46,290 --> 00:11:50,130
this is where you skip lines the most in

307
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:53,340
the middle because you can't see the top

308

likely to skip lines here<font color="#E5E5E5"> and this is</font>

321
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:22,530
general is just a lot harder<font color="#E5E5E5"> compounded</font>

322
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:25,020
by the fact that you don't have these

323
00:12:22,530 --> 00:12:28,470
visual cues to be able to guide you as

324
00:12:25,020 --> 00:12:29,790
you're reading through the lines on top

325
00:12:28,470 --> 00:12:31,680
of that when you're reading on a

326
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:35,610
computer you actually read differently

327
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:37,859
<font color="#CCCCCC">people skate</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> more</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> than</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the reading on</font>

329
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:41,160
around this could be due to the fact

330
00:12:39,150 --> 00:12:43,380
that we have ads all over the place

331
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:44,730
flashing at us it could be because<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

332
00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:48,300
have notifications popping up all the

333
00:12:44,730 --> 00:12:50,820
time but it's just a difference<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so</font>

334
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:52,709
we need to optimize<font color="#E5E5E5"> our reading system</font>

335
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:56,670
on a computer to account for these facts

336
00:12:52,710 --> 00:12:57,960
and allow us to read more efficiently<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

337
00:12:56,670 --> 00:12:59,880
now we're going to talk a bit about some

338
00:12:57,960 --> 00:13:02,670
tools that can make reading on-screen

339
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:04,920
easier and<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about what their claims</font>

340
00:13:02,670 --> 00:13:05,939
are how they work and where they may

341
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:08,729
fall short

342
00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:09,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">so the first is something called rapid</font>

343
00:13:08,730 --> 00:13:10,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">cereal visual presence</font>

curiosity<font color="#E5E5E5"> alright so RSVP is as a</font>

346
00:13:14,250 --> 00:13:19,589
technology where you flash<font color="#E5E5E5"> words that</font>

347
00:13:15,630 --> 00:13:20,430
people really fast<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you hope that you</font>

348
00:13:19,589 --> 00:13:21,690
can read them

349
00:13:20,430 --> 00:13:23,459
this was originally developed in the

350
00:13:21,690 --> 00:13:26,459
late<font color="#E5E5E5"> nineteen fifties but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's had a bit</font>

of a resurgent<font color="#E5E5E5"> recently because it's</font>

00:13:28,259 --> 00:13:34,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">where you have not very much room to</font>

354
00:13:30,149 --> 00:13:36,269
display text<font color="#E5E5E5"> so here's one example</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">if you look carefully i'm going to start</font>

358
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:49,259
<font color="#E5E5E5">was a simple sentence</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it was 500 words</font>

363
00:13:57,959 --> 00:14:10,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">ok that was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> from a scientific paper</font>

about post-concussive<font color="#E5E5E5"> visual disorders</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">that's a harder sentence it was</font>

the words<font color="#CCCCCC"> the thing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is when you saw</font>

a second<font color="#CCCCCC"> what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> does that word mean</font>

00:14:21,689 --> 00:14:25,019
<font color="#E5E5E5">oh that's right it has to do with</font>

372
00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:27,810
concussions<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay now what's happening</font>

00:14:25,019 --> 00:14:31,199
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay i just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> missed three words</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so the</font>

374
00:14:27,810 --> 00:14:33,060
problem is that the train keeps going

375
00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:34,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">even if you're not paying attention and</font>

376
00:14:33,060 --> 00:14:36,630
you can pause it and you can rewind it

377
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:38,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">but researchers</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> found that if you count</font>

378
00:14:36,630 --> 00:14:41,100
the time spent pausing and rewinding

379
00:14:38,490 --> 00:14:43,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">there's actually not much speed benefit</font>

380
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:45,600
and possibly speed detriment to using

381
00:14:43,470 --> 00:14:47,730
this compared to just normal visual

382
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:50,220
reading<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's basically like sprinting</font>

383
00:14:47,730 --> 00:14:54,209
and then stopping<font color="#CCCCCC"> versus just jogging</font>

384
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:56,160
steadily all the way<font color="#E5E5E5"> along so here's one</font>

385
00:14:54,209 --> 00:14:59,459
last example this is 800 words per

386
00:14:56,160 --> 00:15:00,750
minute which is not as fast as some

387
00:14:59,459 --> 00:15:02,579
people claim they can read with us some

388
00:15:00,750 --> 00:15:08,220
people go up<font color="#CCCCCC"> to like 1200 or something</font>

389
00:15:02,579 --> 00:15:09,420
<font color="#CCCCCC">but here's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 800 that was definitely</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> got</font>

00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:11,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">muscles</font>

391
00:15:09,420 --> 00:15:14,219
<font color="#E5E5E5">there's something about muscles in there</font>

392
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:16,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">and you know to be fair this is on a</font>

393
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:17,580
projector which might not be quite as

394
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:19,110
good as having<font color="#CCCCCC"> it on a screen right in</font>

395
00:15:17,580 --> 00:15:21,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">front of it anyway obviously</font>

396
00:15:19,110 --> 00:15:23,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">comprehension drops off at some point</font>

397
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:26,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">there's a bottleneck in the system and</font>

398
00:15:23,250 --> 00:15:29,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">it's your ability to comprehend words</font>

399
00:15:26,070 --> 00:15:32,760
and so you can only go so fast with this

400
00:15:29,580 --> 00:15:35,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> looking at the pros and cons for RSVP</font>

these are<font color="#CCCCCC"> unlike smartwatches which is</font>

403
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:41,370
cool because then you can have the word

you see there's a big paragraph of the

459

you to read more efficiently because you

00:17:58,980 --> 00:18:02,820
you're attaching things you know the

meat to that skeleton and allows you to

465
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:06,780
create a sort of mental model of what

you just read<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you're reading it with</font>

470
00:18:13,409 --> 00:18:16,289
it's harder to create that mental model

471
00:18:15,270 --> 00:18:18,570
especially while you're trying to

472

because everything is just a constant

functional but doesn't have the best

680
00:25:45,809 --> 00:25:50,580
form another downside is it requires a

it's not

some of the challenges we face trying to

695
00:26:21,559 --> 00:26:25,879
actually implement this on the web so we

696
00:26:23,809 --> 00:26:27,889
have a chrome and firefox extension that

697
00:26:25,879 --> 00:26:30,949
you can install<font color="#E5E5E5"> that apply this on any</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">are not identical</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like people have</font>

there's also things like grease monkey

honestly even if you want your site to

<font color="#CCCCCC">I think this is causing tension where</font>

00:28:30,300 --> 00:28:35,580
users want to control their experience

752
00:28:33,570 --> 00:28:36,809
and content creators don't want users to

753
00:28:35,580 --> 00:28:38,370
control their experience and there's

754
00:28:36,809 --> 00:28:42,899
this question about who owns the viewing

755
00:28:38,370 --> 00:28:44,610

our users to select regions of the page

00:30:46,419 --> 00:30:49,570
even characters can be absolutely

815
00:30:47,740 --> 00:30:51,009
positioned<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so there's no guarantee</font>

that the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Dom order of the page is the</font>

817
00:30:51,009 --> 00:30:58,240
same as the reading order so we need to

818
00:30:53,409 --> 00:31:00,190
infer lines from position so we<font color="#E5E5E5"> scan</font>

across the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Dom of JavaScript inferring</font>

00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:08,740
see a large enough change we can we

00:31:07,090 --> 00:31:11,499
build a line and then color it in a

deferring<font color="#E5E5E5"> the coloring and matching it</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">in the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> DOM and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> doing it asynchronously</font>

00:31:40,749 --> 00:31:44,139

little bit of lag but it comes in pretty

842
00:31:44,139 --> 00:31:52,240
quickly now and actually back to<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

843
00:31:49,659 --> 00:31:55,029
<font color="#CCCCCC">thanks</font>

844
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:57,159
so as intervention briefly<font color="#CCCCCC"> we've got</font>

845
00:31:55,029 --> 00:32:00,309
several different tools<font color="#CCCCCC"> the most</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> popular</font>

846
00:31:57,159 --> 00:32:02,350
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> chrome and firefox extensions also</font>

847
00:32:00,309 --> 00:32:05,769
<font color="#E5E5E5">have a nap in the iOS</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> App Store and a</font>

00:32:02,350 --> 00:32:07,330
PDF<font color="#CCCCCC"> plug in our Android tool is in beta</font>

849
00:32:05,769 --> 00:32:09,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">and so if you want to join the beta</font>

850
00:32:07,330 --> 00:32:13,389
<font color="#CCCCCC">email us</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> beta please</font>

851
00:32:09,610 --> 00:32:16,719
and then we also have a<font color="#CCCCCC"> JavaScript that</font>

852
00:32:13,389 --> 00:32:18,129
<font color="#E5E5E5">powers these tools and we write that as</font>

853
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:21,100
well<font color="#E5E5E5"> to folks so they can just build it</font>

854
00:32:18,129 --> 00:32:23,199
into a<font color="#CCCCCC"> site so this is a website for</font>

855
00:32:21,100 --> 00:32:25,689
people who have to read<font color="#E5E5E5"> complex</font>

856
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:27,940
scientific articles<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's meant for PhD</font>

857
00:32:25,690 --> 00:32:28,590
students and they asked if they could

858
00:32:27,940 --> 00:32:30,990
integrate

859
00:32:28,590 --> 00:32:33,090
<font color="#CCCCCC">the line reader and so they have this</font>

860
00:32:30,990 --> 00:32:35,730
thing up at the top<font color="#CCCCCC"> this little bee line</font>

861
00:32:33,090 --> 00:32:38,070
thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> and when you click on it brings</font>

862
00:32:35,730 --> 00:32:40,650
down menu<font color="#E5E5E5"> and this is basically just</font>

863
00:32:38,070 --> 00:32:43,168
ties into our<font color="#CCCCCC"> JavaScript and the user</font>

864
00:32:40,650 --> 00:32:45,960
can select different color schemes<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

865
00:32:43,169 --> 00:32:48,419
it applies the color to the text<font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

866
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:50,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">really the the future for us</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we are</font>

867
00:32:48,419 --> 00:32:53,789
doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> the sort of integrations with</font>

868
00:32:50,370 --> 00:32:55,979
content platforms and even just websites

869
00:32:53,789 --> 00:32:57,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">they want to put this on there and</font>

870
00:32:55,980 --> 00:33:00,330
that's the best way to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> out to people</font>

871
00:32:57,570 --> 00:33:02,399
because it's nice to have plugins for

872
00:33:00,330 --> 00:33:04,889
various different browsers and stuff but

873
00:33:02,399 --> 00:33:07,320
so much<font color="#E5E5E5"> happens on mobile these days and</font>

874
00:33:04,890 --> 00:33:09,840
especially with iOS being closed off<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

875
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:11,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">doing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Otto running</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> extensions there's no</font>

876
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:13,020
way to do that so if you're in<font color="#CCCCCC"> so far</font>

877
00:33:11,370 --> 00:33:16,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">it's just like automatically happening</font>

878
00:33:13,020 --> 00:33:18,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">so if a website has the little button</font>

879
00:33:16,860 --> 00:33:20,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">someone can just click it and turn it on</font>

880
00:33:18,090 --> 00:33:21,449
no matter what platform<font color="#E5E5E5"> there on as</font>

881
00:33:20,070 --> 00:33:23,730
opposed to having people have to go out

882
00:33:21,450 --> 00:33:25,380
and get every single every single

883
00:33:23,730 --> 00:33:26,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">plug-in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we make or every single app that</font>

00:33:25,380 --> 00:33:29,070
we make and trying to to browse it

885
00:33:26,820 --> 00:33:31,470
through that<font color="#E5E5E5"> so look forward to</font>

886
00:33:29,070 --> 00:33:32,490
answering any questions people have<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

distracting something we<font color="#CCCCCC"> hear i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

899
00:34:09,609 --> 00:34:13,418
it's you know for some people it's based

900
00:34:11,619 --> 00:34:15,310
on schooling<font color="#E5E5E5"> like I had a teacher who</font>

901
00:34:13,418 --> 00:34:16,868
marked my papers and<font color="#CCCCCC"> red</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> now</font>

902
00:34:15,310 --> 00:34:19,719
<font color="#CCCCCC">like traumatized by the color red</font>

903
00:34:16,869 --> 00:34:21,460
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's that's why a lot of people to</font>

904
00:34:19,719 --> 00:34:23,529
customize the colors and<font color="#CCCCCC"> changing other</font>

905
00:34:21,460 --> 00:34:24,760
people say<font color="#E5E5E5"> you like the opposite</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i don't</font>

906
00:34:23,530 --> 00:34:27,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">like blue because it reminds me of</font>

907
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:29,470
hyperlinks<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people you</font>

908
00:34:27,699 --> 00:34:32,049
know avoid colors that don't work for

909
00:34:29,469 --> 00:34:34,000
them<font color="#E5E5E5"> because sometimes it makes it stand</font>

910
00:34:32,050 --> 00:34:39,879
out in the wrong way

911
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:41,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">yeah underlining</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> yeah</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's an</font>

912
00:34:39,879 --> 00:34:43,418
interesting issue and we don't currently

913
00:34:41,230 --> 00:34:46,750
have a way to distinguish between<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

914

visited<font color="#CCCCCC"> a non visited</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but yeah it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font>

915
00:34:46,750 --> 00:34:52,060
interesting because previously we used

00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:53,440
color to<font color="#CCCCCC"> dino</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hyperlink</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> yeah</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we have</font>

917
00:34:52,060 --> 00:34:55,270
thought about that<font color="#E5E5E5"> haven't haven't done</font>

918
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:55,929
it but yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> what is a perfect</font>

919
00:34:55,270 --> 00:35:05,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">idea</font>

920
00:34:55,929 --> 00:35:07,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">yeah</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there is so the original idea was</font>

921
00:35:05,530 --> 00:35:10,840
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> to it was actually blue and black</font>

922
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:13,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">and so like I actually</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> hard-coded i mean</font>

923
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:16,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> colored a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> word</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> document one time like</font>

924
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:18,040
the first time<font color="#CCCCCC"> I did</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this and just put</font>

925
00:35:16,180 --> 00:35:20,169
it in blue black black blue blue black

926
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:22,300
black blue<font color="#CCCCCC"> it turned out that solved the</font>

927
00:35:20,170 --> 00:35:23,470
line transition problem but it created a

928
00:35:22,300 --> 00:35:24,490
different problem which was that when

929
00:35:23,470 --> 00:35:27,069
<font color="#E5E5E5">you're like fifty percent through the</font>

930
00:35:24,490 --> 00:35:29,618
line<font color="#E5E5E5"> you tend to go like that and jog</font>

931
00:35:27,070 --> 00:35:32,380
down<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so that obviously is bad so</font>

932
00:35:29,619 --> 00:35:35,410

937
00:35:42,580 --> 00:35:46,690
that when you only have<font color="#E5E5E5"> one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> non black</font>

00:35:48,910 --> 00:35:52,569
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> kind of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 13</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> colors or you know it</font>

support that right now most people don't

943
00:35:54,190 --> 00:35:58,580
need it but it is helpful<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

of<font color="#CCCCCC"> tune on black colors to make it so</font>

that you can track through the<font color="#E5E5E5"> middle</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">older subtler bold colors that is</font>

947
00:36:06,740 --> 00:36:11,959
something we thought about<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's hard to</font>

00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:13,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">greet Dacians in that is a difficulty</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

949
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:16,550
would be cool if we could like build our

950
00:36:13,190 --> 00:36:19,220
own<font color="#CCCCCC"> font</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that the like had gradations of</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">the boldness of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> size that you could you</font>

952
00:36:19,220 --> 00:36:23,959
can do things like this<font color="#E5E5E5"> but it seems</font>

953
00:36:20,810 --> 00:36:26,750
like color works well and the research

954
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:28,490
shows that<font color="#CCCCCC"> so like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what it was we had no</font>

955
00:36:26,750 --> 00:36:29,720
research background on any of this<font color="#CCCCCC"> was</font>

956
00:36:28,490 --> 00:36:31,399
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> like hey</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> wouldn't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it be cool if</font>

957
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:32,959
this seems like it works yeah let's do

958
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:34,580
it<font color="#CCCCCC"> and then since then we've talked a</font>

959
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:35,810
bunch of researchers and<font color="#CCCCCC"> find</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> out like</font>

960
00:36:34,580 --> 00:36:37,520
it turns out when you look at something

961
00:36:35,810 --> 00:36:39,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">the color of the thing is the first</font>

962
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:41,420
thing your brain processes<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can look</font>

963
00:36:39,950 --> 00:36:44,509
<font color="#E5E5E5">at the back wall and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> he's like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

964
00:36:41,420 --> 00:36:46,400
brown<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so if someone says look for</font>

965
00:36:44,510 --> 00:36:47,720
the red thing in the room like you can

966
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:50,510
very easily find<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's the fire</font>

967
00:36:47,720 --> 00:36:52,879
<font color="#E5E5E5">extinguisher case so it turns out color</font>

968
00:36:50,510 --> 00:36:54,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually is very efficient from a</font>

969
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:55,520
cognitive perspective and then it's also

970
00:36:54,350 --> 00:36:57,290
sort of the easiest thing to do

971
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:57,950
continuously<font color="#CCCCCC"> so that's that's what we do</font>

972
00:36:57,290 --> 00:37:03,650
for now

973
00:36:57,950 --> 00:37:05,240
yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> well</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> work with the screen overlays</font>

974
00:37:03,650 --> 00:37:09,710
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> Afghan</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> locks</font>

975
00:37:05,240 --> 00:37:11,779
yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> good question</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so i use that and it</font>

976
00:37:09,710 --> 00:37:16,280
works you may have to<font color="#CCCCCC"> tweak your colors</font>

977
00:37:11,780 --> 00:37:17,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">your beeline colors so that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at night you</font>

978
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:20,120
know when when the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Blue gets</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> kicked out</font>

979
00:37:17,750 --> 00:37:22,100
basically<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it works actually</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> use</font>

980
00:37:20,120 --> 00:37:23,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">the night</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> color scheme that i showed</font>

981
00:37:22,100 --> 00:37:25,580
earlier that's black background with

982
00:37:23,660 --> 00:37:28,520
blue and purple tax and that works fine

983
00:37:25,580 --> 00:37:31,040
with flux and with<font color="#E5E5E5"> night shift on the</font>

984
00:37:28,520 --> 00:37:34,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">whatever they call it on the iOS</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm so</font>

985
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:35,960
it does work<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but yeah great question</font>

986
00:37:34,100 --> 00:37:38,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> something</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we would love to like</font>

987
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:40,460
work with them to actually make it so

988
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:44,180
they don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> take</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> our colors around too</font>

989
00:37:40,460 --> 00:37:48,170
much

990
00:37:44,180 --> 00:37:51,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">that sounds a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> vocalization issues</font>

991
00:37:48,170 --> 00:37:53,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> some vocalization</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is just for</font>

everyone's benefit<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's when you're</font>

993
00:37:53,180 --> 00:37:57,618
reading stuff that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> hear</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of</font>

994
00:37:55,160 --> 00:37:59,149
in your head as<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're reading and and</font>

995
00:37:57,619 --> 00:38:01,069
some people believe that by eliminating

996
00:37:59,150 --> 00:38:02,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">some vocalizations you can read more</font>

997

quickly and with the same comprehension

998
00:38:02,930 --> 00:38:06,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">researchers tend to think that if you</font>

00:38:04,819 --> 00:38:09,319
eliminate some vocalization<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're</font>

1000
00:38:06,770 --> 00:38:12,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">killing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> comprehension so we're kind of</font>

1001
00:38:09,319 --> 00:38:14,930
agnostic on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the question but it does</font>

1002
00:38:12,680 --> 00:38:17,390
match with a sort of bottleneck question

1003
00:38:14,930 --> 00:38:19,308
of if you increase<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> reading speed on</font>

1005
00:38:19,309 --> 00:38:26,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">comprehend things so the research we've</font>

1006
00:38:23,420 --> 00:38:28,130
seen<font color="#CCCCCC"> tens indicate that eliminating some</font>

1007

vocalization allows you to see words

1008
00:38:28,130 --> 00:38:31,460
more quickly but not necessarily read

1009

1012
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:51,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">yeah actually it's interesting and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

1013
00:38:49,609 --> 00:38:52,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">what's really interesting is you know I</font>

1014
00:38:51,020 --> 00:38:54,559
mentioned<font color="#E5E5E5"> before it takes a long time to</font>

1015
00:38:52,700 --> 00:38:57,828
become literate in a pictographic

1016
00:38:54,559 --> 00:38:59,869
culture<font color="#E5E5E5"> now with emoji like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I never use</font>

1017
00:38:57,829 --> 00:39:02,690
emoji and I feel like this daunting

1018
00:38:59,869 --> 00:39:04,369
sense of like kids these days<font color="#E5E5E5"> are going</font>

1019
00:39:02,690 --> 00:39:05,720
to come up with it and they're gonna be

1020
00:39:04,369 --> 00:39:07,250
able to do it really well and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I don't</font>

1021
00:39:05,720 --> 00:39:10,279
<font color="#E5E5E5">even know like what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> without what's the</font>

1022
00:39:07,250 --> 00:39:11,660
universe of emoji and<font color="#E5E5E5"> another's tools</font>

1023
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:13,040
like when you're doing stuff<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think on</font>

1024
00:39:11,660 --> 00:39:15,319
iOS and other tools you can actually

1025
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:17,450
search<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I want an emoji for whatever</font>

1026
00:39:15,319 --> 00:39:19,130
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ten like suggest emoji</font>

1027
00:39:17,450 --> 00:39:20,450
based on what you're typing<font color="#E5E5E5"> so it's</font>

1028
00:39:19,130 --> 00:39:23,450
actually interesting how<font color="#CCCCCC"> we like both</font>

1029
00:39:20,450 --> 00:39:24,890
reverted back to this<font color="#E5E5E5"> pre alphabetic</font>

1030
00:39:23,450 --> 00:39:26,149
culture and then at the same time we've

1031
00:39:24,890 --> 00:39:29,270
done in a better way so you can like

1032
00:39:26,150 --> 00:39:30,530
search and find things<font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> yeah it it</font>

1033
00:39:29,270 --> 00:39:32,869
can be very efficient because you can

1034
00:39:30,530 --> 00:39:34,880
express like a concept<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> emotion</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> more</font>

1035
00:39:32,869 --> 00:39:36,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">so than just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> writing the word but it</font>

1036
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:38,900
creates issues of like remembering

1037
00:39:36,770 --> 00:39:40,609
whether<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's an emoji for like pieces</font>

1038
00:39:38,900 --> 00:39:42,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">of jalapenos on top or like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you know</font>

1039
00:39:40,609 --> 00:39:44,598
<font color="#E5E5E5">what exactly it is you're looking for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> or</font>

1040
00:39:42,950 --> 00:39:49,430
<font color="#CCCCCC">if you have to do like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> pizza and then</font>

1041
00:39:44,599 --> 00:39:52,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">the jalapeno yeah</font>

1042
00:39:49,430 --> 00:39:55,308
<font color="#CCCCCC">get the leader of the walls or still</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">readable listing</font>

1044
00:39:55,309 --> 00:40:00,230
yes sort of but we actually recognize

1045
00:39:57,740 --> 00:40:01,879
words largely based on shape<font color="#CCCCCC"> so if you</font>

1046
00:40:00,230 --> 00:40:04,099
eliminate the vowels for someone<font color="#E5E5E5"> who is</font>

1047
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:06,950
skilled in reading words that have<font color="#E5E5E5"> fouls</font>

1048
00:40:04,099 --> 00:40:09,349
in them like you're eliminating<font color="#CCCCCC"> ease and</font>

1049
00:40:06,950 --> 00:40:11,750
eyes and<font color="#E5E5E5"> a's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> nose and said like</font>

1050
00:40:09,349 --> 00:40:13,849
basically all<font color="#CCCCCC"> those are short and so</font>

1051
00:40:11,750 --> 00:40:15,079
anything of like the skyline of New York

1052
00:40:13,849 --> 00:40:16,670
City if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> like eliminated all the</font>

1053
00:40:15,079 --> 00:40:17,809
short<font color="#E5E5E5"> buildings</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> everything which is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> tall</font>

1054
00:40:16,670 --> 00:40:20,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">buildings it's just everything looks</font>

1055
00:40:17,809 --> 00:40:21,440
like a chunk<font color="#CCCCCC"> which is why</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's actually</font>

1056
00:40:20,150 --> 00:40:24,710
hard to read stuff<font color="#CCCCCC"> it in all</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> caps</font>

1057
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:26,059
<font color="#CCCCCC">because</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the word shape is just</font>

1058
00:40:24,710 --> 00:40:33,280
completely obliterated everything is

1059
00:40:26,059 --> 00:40:35,670
just like a rectangle<font color="#E5E5E5"> there one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> by</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

1063
00:40:39,880 --> 00:40:42,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">as opposed to just web</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I mean enter you</font>

1064
00:40:41,859 --> 00:40:43,869
can<font color="#CCCCCC"> talk a little bit about the</font>

challenges

1066
00:40:43,869 --> 00:40:49,900
yes so we haven't dug into<font color="#CCCCCC"> it deeply</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

1067
00:40:46,750 --> 00:40:51,849
started on the web and you're totally

1068
00:40:49,900 --> 00:40:54,309
right<font color="#E5E5E5"> that for jailbroken devices we</font>

1069
00:40:51,849 --> 00:40:56,289
probably could do it<font color="#CCCCCC"> on iOS and it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

1070
00:40:54,309 --> 00:40:57,940
is easier to jailbreak on<font color="#CCCCCC"> Android and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

1071
00:40:56,289 --> 00:41:01,329
we probably could<font color="#E5E5E5"> there</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we haven't</font>

1072
00:40:57,940 --> 00:41:03,039
really gone that route<font color="#E5E5E5"> yet although</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I i</font>

1075
00:41:05,260 --> 00:41:08,559
before they said that<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's like the</font>

1076
00:41:06,670 --> 00:41:10,599
the generic text views which maybe you

1077
00:41:08,559 --> 00:41:12,099
could replace but then a lot of apps

1078
00:41:10,599 --> 00:41:13,359
actually end up using their own text

1079
00:41:12,099 --> 00:41:16,809
views which then we wouldn't be able to

1080
00:41:13,359 --> 00:41:19,720
replace so<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah it's actually more</font>

1081
00:41:16,809 --> 00:41:24,980
difficult than one might hope was<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

my mom told me not to

1095
00:42:00,030 --> 00:42:05,580
20 minutes you should take<font color="#E5E5E5"> 20 seconds</font>

1096
00:42:03,210 --> 00:42:07,470
and look 200 feet away<font color="#CCCCCC"> its</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there's some</font>

meant to be like visually focus like

1100
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:14,730
right here and when you are visually

00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:16,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">focus your eyes have to do something</font>

00:42:14,730 --> 00:42:17,760
different than when<font color="#E5E5E5"> their</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> vision</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

00:42:19,290 --> 00:42:22,620
essentially parallel<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hundred percent</font>

1106
00:42:20,790 --> 00:42:24,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">they're looking straight off into the</font>

distance and<font color="#E5E5E5"> your your brain can put</font>

1108
00:42:24,930 --> 00:42:27,960
together those two images

00:42:25,650 --> 00:42:29,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">stereoscopically because you're just</font>

1110
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:30,750
looking straight ahead<font color="#CCCCCC"> percent ahead</font>

1111
00:42:29,250 --> 00:42:31,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">when you're looking something that's</font>

1112
00:42:30,750 --> 00:42:32,520
close to you

1113
00:42:31,560 --> 00:42:34,620
your eyes are doing what's called

1114
00:42:32,520 --> 00:42:36,870
converging<font color="#E5E5E5"> so one of them looks that way</font>

1115
00:42:34,620 --> 00:42:38,490
and it looks that way<font color="#E5E5E5"> and some people</font>

1116
00:42:36,870 --> 00:42:40,049
have issues with this either<font color="#CCCCCC"> /</font>

1117
00:42:38,490 --> 00:42:42,959
convergence or under convergence which

1118
00:42:40,050 --> 00:42:44,640
both lead double vision<font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah it's</font>

1119
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:46,650
reasonable to think that since we

1120
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:48,750
weren't meant to I mean it's not like we

1121
00:42:46,650 --> 00:42:50,670
did other things for super long periods

1122
00:42:48,750 --> 00:42:52,500
of time like knitting or you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

1123
00:42:50,670 --> 00:42:53,760
don't know what we did back then<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

1124
00:42:52,500 --> 00:42:55,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">would have been so close up but you</font>

1125
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:58,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">would have been looking around</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> naturally</font>

1126
00:42:55,890 --> 00:43:00,060
so it is reasonable think that that that

1127
00:42:58,110 --> 00:43:01,800
would be not great<font color="#E5E5E5"> for eyes and like</font>

1128
00:43:00,060 --> 00:43:03,750
based on my experience<font color="#CCCCCC"> I had</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to get</font>

1129
00:43:01,800 --> 00:43:05,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">glasses when I was in grad school</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I was</font>

1130
00:43:03,750 --> 00:43:10,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">reading a lot like probably that was not</font>

1131
00:43:05,550 --> 00:43:12,829
unrelated<font color="#E5E5E5"> was there one other question</font>

1132
00:43:10,990 --> 00:43:16,669
<font color="#CCCCCC">Oh</font>

1133
00:43:12,829 --> 00:43:18,289
<font color="#CCCCCC">yeah</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so to the extent that people often</font>

1134
00:43:16,670 --> 00:43:19,700
are badly<font color="#E5E5E5"> positioned when reading off</font>

1135
00:43:18,289 --> 00:43:21,739
screens like when you're reading a book

1136
00:43:19,700 --> 00:43:23,269
like you are holding the book and you

1137
00:43:21,739 --> 00:43:24,799
put it wherever you want it<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of</font>

1138
00:43:23,269 --> 00:43:26,569
<font color="#E5E5E5">people don't have screens in the right</font>

1139
00:43:24,799 --> 00:43:28,880
position and<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're like sitting on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

1140
00:43:26,569 --> 00:43:31,009
chair<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's not high enough and you end</font>

1141
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:32,959
up like looking up too much not blinking

1142
00:43:31,009 --> 00:43:33,979
<font color="#E5E5E5">enough and so that can be bad</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i don't</font>

1143
00:43:32,959 --> 00:43:35,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">think there's evidence that it's</font>

1144
00:43:33,979 --> 00:43:38,629
intrinsically bad<font color="#CCCCCC"> like you couldn't have</font>

1145
00:43:35,930 --> 00:43:41,089
a good experience<font color="#E5E5E5"> reading off the screen</font>

1146
00:43:38,630 --> 00:43:43,819
either LCD or e ink<font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I think</font>

1147
00:43:41,089 --> 00:43:45,709
positionally<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's the problem is as</font>

1148
00:43:43,819 --> 00:43:57,349
<font color="#E5E5E5">just basically we're not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> right setup</font>

1149
00:43:45,709 --> 00:44:00,109
<font color="#E5E5E5">right</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> yeah</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there as well</font>

1150
00:43:57,349 --> 00:44:02,539
<font color="#E5E5E5">yeah so it can be done a grayscale we do</font>

1151
00:44:00,109 --> 00:44:03,739
not have anything that works with<font color="#CCCCCC"> ink</font>

1152
00:44:02,539 --> 00:44:06,349
although<font color="#CCCCCC"> i was talking with somebody</font>

1153
00:44:03,739 --> 00:44:07,640
today<font color="#E5E5E5"> I so we have a booth here and</font>

1154
00:44:06,349 --> 00:44:10,130
somebody came by and was like<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font>

trading an alternate<font color="#E5E5E5"> OS for the ink</font>

00:44:10,130 --> 00:44:15,529
<font color="#E5E5E5">readers and I was like yeah let's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> let's</font>

1157
00:44:13,549 --> 00:44:17,390
do<font color="#CCCCCC"> something that's exciting for us</font>

1158
00:44:15,529 --> 00:44:19,369
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> i know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people really do like the</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">e-ink</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> display</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> one of the reasons that</font>

1160
00:44:19,369 --> 00:44:23,869
color<font color="#CCCCCC"> e-ink is not cut on is because you</font>

1161
00:44:21,499 --> 00:44:25,218
can't use it for<font color="#CCCCCC"> four photographs or</font>

1162
00:44:23,869 --> 00:44:27,109
images because it's not like

1163
00:44:25,219 --> 00:44:28,999
<font color="#CCCCCC">high-contrast enough</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but would totally</font>

1164
00:44:27,109 --> 00:44:31,160
work for this<font color="#CCCCCC"> so we're hoping that we</font>

1165
00:44:28,999 --> 00:44:32,749
can get something on<font color="#CCCCCC"> ink we're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to</font>

00:44:31,160 --> 00:44:34,279
talk to<font color="#CCCCCC"> amazon but not surprisingly</font>

00:45:54,540 --> 00:45:58,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">psychologist like to do things to their</font>

1187
00:45:56,580 --> 00:46:00,779
test subjects where they have been doing

1188
00:45:58,380 --> 00:46:02,760
a task and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> they make them bad at it</font>

1189
00:46:00,780 --> 00:46:04,560
by like throwing in things<font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font>

1190
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:06,540
researchers found out a long time ago

1191
00:46:04,560 --> 00:46:08,910
how you can make people bad at saying

1192
00:46:06,540 --> 00:46:11,190
the words of<font color="#CCCCCC"> colors by Blake printing</font>

1193
00:46:08,910 --> 00:46:12,899
the word orange and purple<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so they</font>

1194
00:46:11,190 --> 00:46:14,580
came to<font color="#E5E5E5"> this conclusion that haha you</font>

1195
00:46:12,900 --> 00:46:17,250
know<font color="#CCCCCC"> your we've screwed</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people up at</font>

1196
00:46:14,580 --> 00:46:19,140
reading by using<font color="#CCCCCC"> color and I thought you</font>

1197
00:46:17,250 --> 00:46:20,820
know that's great<font color="#E5E5E5"> but being slightly</font>

1198
00:46:19,140 --> 00:46:21,810
less sadistic than that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> thought maybe</font>

1199
00:46:20,820 --> 00:46:23,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">there'd be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> way you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> could actually make</font>

1200
00:46:21,810 --> 00:46:25,770
people better doing something as opposed

1201
00:46:23,340 --> 00:46:28,380
to worse<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so the idea was take this</font>

1202
00:46:25,770 --> 00:46:31,170
channel<font color="#CCCCCC"> that like color channel and use</font>

1203
00:46:28,380 --> 00:46:32,550
it to flag something useful

1204
00:46:31,170 --> 00:46:34,350
other than highlighting which is what<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

1205
00:46:32,550 --> 00:46:36,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> obviously done before but use it to</font>

1206
00:46:34,350 --> 00:46:37,200
<font color="#CCCCCC">to flag like here's where I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> should go</font>

1207
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:38,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">next</font>

1208
00:46:37,200 --> 00:46:41,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">so that's sort of the origin story and</font>

1209
00:46:38,700 --> 00:46:43,859
then<font color="#E5E5E5"> working with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> andrew who is my</font>

1210
00:46:41,160 --> 00:46:45,720
cousin and who was at a college very

1211
00:46:43,859 --> 00:46:49,590
nearby<font color="#E5E5E5"> so that's sort of where it</font>

1212
00:46:45,720 --> 00:46:51,270
started

1213
00:46:49,590 --> 00:46:54,540
text processing at the moment is

1214
00:46:51,270 --> 00:47:00,310
automated<font color="#CCCCCC"> I need tools</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for content</font>

1215
00:46:54,540 --> 00:47:03,160
creators<font color="#E5E5E5"> to determine what should</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people</font>

1216
00:47:00,310 --> 00:47:04,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">so if people use the JavaScript SDK the</font>

1217
00:47:03,160 --> 00:47:06,700
library we can give you<font color="#E5E5E5"> then you can</font>

1218
00:47:04,630 --> 00:47:08,560
select whatever<font color="#CCCCCC"> regions you want in the</font>

1219
00:47:06,700 --> 00:47:10,689
<font color="#CCCCCC">DOM</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and color them either by putting a</font>

1220
00:47:08,560 --> 00:47:12,250
class on them<font color="#E5E5E5"> or just navigating to them</font>

1221
00:47:10,690 --> 00:47:16,600
and calling the function on them

1222
00:47:12,250 --> 00:47:18,280
directly and<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> JavaScript handles</font>

1223
00:47:16,600 --> 00:47:19,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">everything like if the user resizes the</font>

1224
00:47:18,280 --> 00:47:21,250
window then don't like going to recolor

1225
00:47:19,930 --> 00:47:24,069
so basically all you<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to do is say</font>

1226
00:47:21,250 --> 00:47:25,150
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> here's the text and then the user</font>

1227
00:47:24,070 --> 00:47:25,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">selects the colors and that's all there</font>

1228
00:47:25,150 --> 00:47:32,890
is

1229
00:47:25,510 --> 00:47:36,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">yeah in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the back so if i have to align</font>

1230
00:47:32,890 --> 00:47:41,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">and stylish</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and idea</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like my own</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> website</font>

1231
00:47:36,970 --> 00:47:44,709
<font color="#CCCCCC">stop but i haven't used stylish</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what is</font>

1232
00:47:41,500 --> 00:47:45,829
<font color="#E5E5E5">stylish this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> would just be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> my own</font>

1233
00:47:44,710 --> 00:47:47,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">website</font>

1234
00:47:45,829 --> 00:47:48,829

1235
00:47:47,900 --> 00:47:51,469

<font color="#E5E5E5">yeah</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> probably</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can get the more</font>

1237
00:47:51,469 --> 00:47:54,619
to work together<font color="#E5E5E5"> because you certainly</font>

1238
00:47:52,609 --> 00:47:57,859
could tell stylish to ignore inline

1239
00:47:54,619 --> 00:48:00,140
styles or vice versa you could<font color="#CCCCCC"> there is</font>

1240
00:47:57,859 --> 00:48:03,950
a<font color="#CCCCCC"> both an attribute in class you can put</font>

1241
00:48:00,140 --> 00:48:08,089
on content that will tell<font color="#CCCCCC"> bill I neither</font>

1242
00:48:03,950 --> 00:48:09,319
