17
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:41,040
and she's like what you're doing is

18
00:00:37,559 --> 00:00:42,449
finding the negative space and pointing

19

to the surveillance program that lives

20
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:46,649
in that negative space so I'm going to

is people like oh my gosh the IRS has

237
00:08:53,450 --> 00:08:56,660
basically conducted a search inside his

265
00:09:56,330 --> 00:10:01,070
seeing states that are requiring

requiring it<font color="#E5E5E5"> requiring a warrant or at</font>

00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:06,110
requiring the judges understand this

kind of magic process that allows you to

find phones but even there<font color="#E5E5E5"> there are</font>

still things about<font color="#CCCCCC"> stingray that we</font>

things that that are kind of excluded

276
00:10:22,220 --> 00:10:25,280
from their new policy which is generally

277
00:10:24,260 --> 00:10:27,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">we're going to get a warrant with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

286
00:10:44,510 --> 00:10:47,960
the rule right there they said we can

use it<font color="#CCCCCC"> an</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> exigent circumstances which</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">we use it there's this weird language in</font>

291
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:59,070
the policy that says this applies to

292
00:10:56,250 --> 00:11:01,620
when federal<font color="#CCCCCC"> sting rays</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are used even</font>

293
00:10:59,070 --> 00:11:04,500
local situations<font color="#E5E5E5"> but it doesn't apply</font>

294
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:06,330
when local stingrays are used with FBI

295
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:09,840
involvement which happens all all the

296
00:11:06,330 --> 00:11:11,790
time<font color="#E5E5E5"> so again</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> swallows the rule they</font>

297
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:13,710
said you know in national<font color="#E5E5E5"> security cases</font>

00:11:11,790 --> 00:11:16,439
<font color="#CCCCCC">in five</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so we sort of will use the same</font>

299
00:11:13,710 --> 00:11:18,870
policy kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then there's this</font>

300
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:20,610
really remarkable one<font color="#E5E5E5"> there may be other</font>

301

circumstances in which<font color="#E5E5E5"> although exigent</font>

00:11:20,610 --> 00:11:24,060

first obtain approval blah<font color="#CCCCCC"> so there's</font>

00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:38,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">this other use which is exceptional not</font>

00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:41,190
exigent<font color="#CCCCCC"> I suspect</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and this is another</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">this is kind of another black hole in</font>

311
00:11:41,190 --> 00:11:46,380
the well in a lot of them in a lot of

<font color="#CCCCCC">the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> non-disclosure agreements that got</font>

314
00:11:48,330 --> 00:11:53,670
<font color="#CCCCCC">there's language about public safety so</font>

315
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:56,700
there's that case in<font color="#CCCCCC"> Chicago where some</font>

00:11:53,670 --> 00:11:59,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">things black eyes activists or</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">progression</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but anyway</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> where some some</font>

318
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:03,480
of the leaders of the protest were

319
00:12:01,380 --> 00:12:07,740
clearly targeted with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Stingray so</font>

320
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:13,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">public safety AKA protests but in the</font>

321
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:14,910
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Boston Marathon trial</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> was very</font>

322
00:12:13,530 --> 00:12:17,490
interesting because all of the FBI

323
00:12:14,910 --> 00:12:18,660
agents who came<font color="#CCCCCC"> in swartz or whatever</font>

324
00:12:17,490 --> 00:12:20,850
they were talking about

325
00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:22,530
not all but many of them<font color="#E5E5E5"> were not the</font>

326
00:12:20,850 --> 00:12:23,850
people who actually were involved

327
00:12:22,530 --> 00:12:26,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">they're like oh</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I've read the forensics</font>

328
00:12:23,850 --> 00:12:26,670
report<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that's as</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i'll get to in a</font>

329
00:12:26,130 --> 00:12:29,010
second

330
00:12:26,670 --> 00:12:30,030
that's always a good sign that there's a

331
00:12:29,010 --> 00:12:31,260
reason<font color="#CCCCCC"> they don't want to put the guy</font>

332
00:12:30,030 --> 00:12:33,839
who knows everything on the stand

333
00:12:31,260 --> 00:12:34,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">because if he was asked an interesting</font>

334
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:37,290
question<font color="#E5E5E5"> he might have to tell the truth</font>

335
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:38,760
and so I think there's good reason to

336
00:12:37,290 --> 00:12:39,870
believe that<font color="#CCCCCC"> their sting rays at that at</font>

337
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:42,540
the finish line of the Boston Marathon

338
00:12:39,870 --> 00:12:44,190
as well also<font color="#CCCCCC"> again</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Facebook</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font>

339
00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:46,319
<font color="#CCCCCC">there's also</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> good reasons to believe</font>

340
00:12:44,190 --> 00:12:50,130
that the brothers were officially

341
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:51,840
recognized but<font color="#E5E5E5"> so that's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> mean one of</font>

342
00:12:50,130 --> 00:12:53,130
the one of one of my goals for this talk

343
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:55,350
is for you guys to read this and go

344
00:12:53,130 --> 00:12:57,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">here's what I think exceptional is and</font>

345
00:12:55,350 --> 00:12:59,459
start brainstorming it because that's

346
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:02,369
the way we're actually going to identify

347
00:12:59,459 --> 00:13:03,599
these things<font color="#CCCCCC"> so where do you find these</font>

348
00:13:02,369 --> 00:13:06,059
things<font color="#CCCCCC"> 1 i've already talked about</font>

349
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:09,179
legislation<font color="#E5E5E5"> veto threats are perfect</font>

350
00:13:06,059 --> 00:13:11,969
place to find black holes because the

351
00:13:09,179 --> 00:13:14,220
stuff<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> fit they threaten you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on court</font>

352
00:13:11,970 --> 00:13:16,800
documents and testimony right so as I

353
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:18,360
just said<font color="#E5E5E5"> if if the FBI agent on the</font>

354
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:20,099
stand is not the one who actually has

355
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:22,740
personal knowledge<font color="#CCCCCC"> chances are good</font>

356
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:24,269
there's you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> maybe not good but it's</font>

357
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:25,829
often the case that the guy is trying to

358
00:13:24,269 --> 00:13:28,439
hide something

359
00:13:25,829 --> 00:13:30,479
borders in<font color="#CCCCCC"> wars obviously</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> stingray</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

360
00:13:28,439 --> 00:13:36,059
started off as<font color="#E5E5E5"> war toy now we're seeing</font>

361
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:38,670
robots right<font color="#CCCCCC"> lethally skilled assassins</font>

362
00:13:36,059 --> 00:13:40,769
or<font color="#E5E5E5"> whatever but borders</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i have this joke</font>

363
00:13:38,670 --> 00:13:42,240
my husband's foreign and so when we

364
00:13:40,769 --> 00:13:43,740
cross the border together there's always

365
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:46,920
new<font color="#E5E5E5"> technology</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> collecting from</font>

366
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:49,589
him and like two years ago when he got

367
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:51,360
his irises<font color="#CCCCCC"> scanned I was like you know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

368
00:13:49,589 --> 00:13:52,829
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> three year process between</font>

369
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:54,300
the time they collect something<font color="#E5E5E5"> for my</font>

370
00:13:52,829 --> 00:13:56,160
spouse at the border and the time we

371
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:57,809
learned<font color="#E5E5E5"> FBI has a massive database of it</font>

372
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:59,279
<font color="#CCCCCC">took two years in this case we just</font>

373
00:13:57,809 --> 00:14:00,540
learned that they have among other you

374
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:04,499
know among the other<font color="#CCCCCC"> biometrics they</font>

00:14:04,499 --> 00:14:09,240
protests<font color="#E5E5E5"> again you're seeing a lot of</font>

377
00:14:06,839 --> 00:14:10,619
the technology<font color="#CCCCCC"> later added protests if</font>

378
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:11,999
you see that they're collecting

379
00:14:10,619 --> 00:14:13,829
information but you don't know where it

380
00:14:11,999 --> 00:14:15,660
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's that's where you know it lives</font>

381
00:14:13,829 --> 00:14:16,618
<font color="#E5E5E5">devices and purchase orders that's not</font>

382
00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:18,059
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm really going to talk about</font>

383
00:14:16,619 --> 00:14:20,189
that something technical people are much

384
00:14:18,059 --> 00:14:22,618
smarter than<font color="#E5E5E5"> I am you know if you go</font>

385
00:14:20,189 --> 00:14:24,779
find the purchase order<font color="#CCCCCC"> again</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> stingrays</font>

already that if the FBI agent on the

stand is the one who has the personal

430

why that is<font color="#E5E5E5"> there was this wonderful</font>

15 and then the narrative goes blank and

442

then stuff starts again<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically after</font>

sort of like why is this woman<font color="#E5E5E5"> writing</font>

the complaint rather than<font color="#E5E5E5"> somebody who</font>

time and space as well that there's you

know that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I mean one of the things are</font>

often missing there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the FBI may throw</font>

multiple informants at somebody but they

00:17:13,630 --> 00:17:18,220
also<font color="#E5E5E5"> may be throwing you know different</font>

ways to get inside a chat room or

different ways to<font color="#E5E5E5"> to track this person</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">and then weasel words about discovery</font>

464
00:17:29,150 --> 00:17:33,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">i think of many people making plea deals</font>

465
00:17:31,460 --> 00:17:35,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">is they never get all the way through</font>

466
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:36,050
discovery and their lawyers never<font color="#E5E5E5"> start</font>

467
00:17:35,060 --> 00:17:37,429
complaining about the stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're</font>

seeing<font color="#E5E5E5"> and discovery because that's what</font>

469
00:17:37,430 --> 00:17:41,570
that's one place to really learn is when

470
00:17:38,870 --> 00:17:44,179
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> lawyer say I'm seeing all these</font>

emails<font color="#E5E5E5"> they don't make sense where did</font>

472
00:17:44,180 --> 00:17:49,130
you get the emails from<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you may</font>

never see<font color="#CCCCCC"> I never see the emails but i</font>

474
00:17:49,130 --> 00:17:52,820
know that there's some emails out there

475
00:17:50,690 --> 00:17:54,710
that came from some unknown space and

476
00:17:52,820 --> 00:17:56,030
it's probably pretty interesting<font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font>

477
00:17:54,710 --> 00:17:59,270
parallel<font color="#E5E5E5"> construction is something else</font>

478
00:17:56,030 --> 00:18:00,889
you need to be really<font color="#CCCCCC"> that that's what</font>

479
00:17:59,270 --> 00:18:02,690
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're using parallel</font>

480
00:18:00,890 --> 00:18:04,730
construction to hide their good stuff<font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font>

481
00:18:02,690 --> 00:18:06,350
when you see parallel construction or

482
00:18:04,730 --> 00:18:08,870
suspect it and kind of makes you into a

happens a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> surveillance you can make</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">an emergency request and then three days</font>

00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:48,280
or a week or whatever you have to come

525

00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:42,460
we're actually seeing that still in

there are seven total uses of this<font color="#CCCCCC"> all</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">adding to this purpose</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so if anyone has</font>

652
00:24:48,059 --> 00:24:51,869
any really good creative uses but one

653
00:24:50,369 --> 00:24:54,418
obvious one is the calling card right

654
00:24:51,869 --> 00:24:56,129
<font color="#E5E5E5">but that we know that in the phone</font>

calling card<font color="#E5E5E5"> not credit card information</font>

657
00:24:59,009 --> 00:25:02,429
but the<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know that so that's one</font>

658
00:25:01,139 --> 00:25:05,008
thing that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're almost certainly</font>

was staying with<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so they got</font>

690
00:26:25,879 --> 00:26:30,168
location from snapchat<font color="#CCCCCC"> then they would</font>

691
00:26:28,639 --> 00:26:32,658
find him so that's the kind of

692
00:26:30,169 --> 00:26:34,429
applications are using but obviously

693
00:26:32,659 --> 00:26:36,019
you're getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> embedded location</font>

694
00:26:34,429 --> 00:26:39,499
information and you're getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> location</font>

695
00:26:36,019 --> 00:26:42,230
information for two people at<font color="#E5E5E5"> often or</font>

696
00:26:39,499 --> 00:26:44,869
at least<font color="#E5E5E5"> and this is the language that</font>

697
00:26:42,230 --> 00:26:46,399
they gave<font color="#E5E5E5"> widen</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font>

00:26:44,869 --> 00:26:49,249
particularly<font color="#E5E5E5"> interested in and you'll</font>

699
00:26:46,399 --> 00:26:50,928
see why in a second is that you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font>

700
00:26:49,249 --> 00:26:52,309
questions<font color="#CCCCCC"> consider include whether or</font>

701
00:26:50,929 --> 00:26:55,249
not the information sought would target

702
00:26:52,309 --> 00:26:56,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">an individual and individual in an area</font>

703
00:26:55,249 --> 00:27:00,080
in which that person has a reasonable

704
00:26:56,570 --> 00:27:02,869
expectation of privacy which suggests

705
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:05,570
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> they there maybe applications when</font>

706
00:27:02,869 --> 00:27:07,340
they would not get<font color="#CCCCCC"> oh</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so in the face</font>

707
00:27:05,570 --> 00:27:08,720
account<font color="#CCCCCC"> so the good news about the FISA</font>

708
00:27:07,340 --> 00:27:10,879
<font color="#CCCCCC">Court I was just defending them and</font>

709
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:12,950
here's why is that because of

710
00:27:10,879 --> 00:27:15,799
magistrates and now<font color="#CCCCCC"> district court</font>

711
00:27:12,950 --> 00:27:17,869
opinions that say you need a warrant for

712
00:27:15,799 --> 00:27:19,610
location<font color="#E5E5E5"> they have defaulted to</font>

713
00:27:17,869 --> 00:27:22,340
requiring the equivalent of a warrant

714
00:27:19,610 --> 00:27:24,258
under FISA for location data for those

715
00:27:22,340 --> 00:27:26,240
same<font color="#E5E5E5"> application so perspective you know</font>

716
00:27:24,259 --> 00:27:28,940
they want to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> gps data</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> what have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

717
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:31,730
which means the FBI will actually use

718
00:27:28,940 --> 00:27:33,679
criminal in states where the where the

719
00:27:31,730 --> 00:27:35,899
standard is lower the FBI will bypass

720
00:27:33,679 --> 00:27:37,309
<font color="#CCCCCC">paisa</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> because the standard is lower in</font>

721
00:27:35,899 --> 00:27:38,239
the criminal context<font color="#CCCCCC"> than it is in the</font>

722
00:27:37,309 --> 00:27:40,668
<font color="#CCCCCC">face of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> contact</font>

723
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:42,019
<font color="#CCCCCC">this is probably one big reason why we</font>

724
00:27:40,669 --> 00:27:43,220
got USA Freedom Act is because they

725
00:27:42,019 --> 00:27:46,309
weren't able to collect<font color="#CCCCCC"> cellphone data</font>

726
00:27:43,220 --> 00:27:48,200
under under those rules so here's what

727
00:27:46,309 --> 00:27:50,418
here's where<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think it's going</font>

728
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:53,509
this was a story from<font color="#CCCCCC"> cash</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hill at</font>

729
00:27:50,419 --> 00:27:58,669
fusion and less than a month ago and

730
00:27:53,509 --> 00:28:01,279
some guy who<font color="#CCCCCC"> i attended a help or a</font>

731
00:27:58,669 --> 00:28:04,429
support group for parents of suicidal

732
00:28:01,279 --> 00:28:07,009
teens<font color="#E5E5E5"> met somebody there and the next</font>

733
00:28:04,429 --> 00:28:08,629
day was invited to do a<font color="#CCCCCC"> Facebook</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

735
00:28:08,629 --> 00:28:12,918

736
00:28:11,330 --> 00:28:14,539
metadata from this person I don't have

737
00:28:12,919 --> 00:28:16,639
it there's no way they could have

738
00:28:14,539 --> 00:28:18,950
connected us<font color="#E5E5E5"> they could tie us together</font>

739
00:28:16,639 --> 00:28:20,178
<font color="#E5E5E5">and so she called it was it's really</font>

740
00:28:18,950 --> 00:28:22,100
funny if you guys haven't read this

741
00:28:20,179 --> 00:28:23,509
story<font color="#E5E5E5"> should look it up because she</font>

742
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:25,059
called<font color="#CCCCCC"> Facebook they're like yeah we do</font>

743
00:28:23,509 --> 00:28:27,580
that we use

744
00:28:25,059 --> 00:28:32,529
<font color="#CCCCCC">lately</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we use</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> colocation so if you go to</font>

745
00:28:27,580 --> 00:28:34,449
this group of parents of suicidal<font color="#E5E5E5"> teens</font>

746
00:28:32,529 --> 00:28:35,919
right if you go to<font color="#E5E5E5"> screw with suicidal</font>

747
00:28:34,450 --> 00:28:38,440
<font color="#CCCCCC">teams</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sure</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> will give you guys friend</font>

748
00:28:35,919 --> 00:28:40,299
<font color="#CCCCCC">request</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like the immediate use cases</font>

749
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:41,769
horrifying<font color="#CCCCCC"> and then by the end of the</font>

750
00:28:40,299 --> 00:28:45,009
day they were like no we don't do that

751
00:28:41,769 --> 00:28:46,929
<font color="#E5E5E5">and then the next day</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like well</font>

752
00:28:45,009 --> 00:28:48,519
we did a test a little while ago<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

753
00:28:46,929 --> 00:28:52,179
these are the famous<font color="#CCCCCC"> facebook tests</font>

754
00:28:48,519 --> 00:28:55,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">facebook of course is a member is is a</font>

755
00:28:52,179 --> 00:28:58,059
prison provider<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you can imagine how</font>

756
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:59,949
this same application would be very

757
00:28:58,059 --> 00:29:03,399
useful<font color="#CCCCCC"> growth</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for intelligence services</font>

758
00:28:59,950 --> 00:29:06,519
and for the FBI to be able to go to

759
00:29:03,399 --> 00:29:08,709
<font color="#CCCCCC">Facebook and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> say give us give us</font>

760
00:29:06,519 --> 00:29:11,019
everybody who was at this meeting and

761
00:29:08,710 --> 00:29:13,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">and do it if you need with location data</font>

762
00:29:11,019 --> 00:29:16,629
and of course<font color="#CCCCCC"> facebook has multiple ways</font>

763
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:19,119
of getting to location data<font color="#E5E5E5"> so again</font>

764
00:29:16,629 --> 00:29:20,439
that's just my hypothesis

765
00:29:19,119 --> 00:29:22,029
facebook says they're not doing it for

766
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:24,639
you guys but that doesn't mean the FBI

767
00:29:22,029 --> 00:29:26,619
and NSA<font color="#E5E5E5"> aren't doing and NSA has</font>

768
00:29:24,639 --> 00:29:28,149
applications like that for other<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

769
00:29:26,619 --> 00:29:29,619
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> for the data they collect so the</font>

770
00:29:28,149 --> 00:29:32,320
notion that they wouldn't ask<font color="#CCCCCC"> an essay</font>

771
00:29:29,619 --> 00:29:35,289
for<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> oops facebook not</font>

772
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:36,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">gonna say I'm condition that they</font>

773
00:29:35,289 --> 00:29:43,210
wouldn't ask<font color="#CCCCCC"> NSA facebook about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it is</font>

774
00:29:36,970 --> 00:29:44,710
just crazy so<font color="#E5E5E5"> USA Freedom Act</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm i was</font>

00:29:47,289 --> 00:29:51,070
you've heard over and over again that

00:29:52,929 --> 00:29:59,289
the link this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this language here</font>

way to prevent<font color="#E5E5E5"> ball collection in any</font>

1067
00:41:03,630 --> 00:41:06,780
of a question we got an illustration of

00:41:05,310 --> 00:41:17,619
what not to do in one of the earlier

1072
00:41:21,309 --> 00:41:25,059
to me a lot is the talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> showed from</font>

the<font color="#CCCCCC"> floor</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> request that was essentially</font>

anything we can do to strengthen<font color="#CCCCCC"> FOIA or</font>

1077
00:41:34,420 --> 00:41:39,970
strengthening the requirements on what

1078
00:41:36,519 --> 00:41:41,680
can and cannot be<font color="#E5E5E5"> redacted because</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

1079
00:41:39,970 --> 00:41:43,569
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> in that way we'll be able to find</font>

1080

out a lot more information

1081
00:41:43,569 --> 00:41:48,519
yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> mean that stuff</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> was all redacted</font>

1082
00:41:45,579 --> 00:41:50,980
on a<font color="#CCCCCC"> law enforcement sources and methods</font>

1083
00:41:48,519 --> 00:41:53,319
and the government unfortunately has

1084
00:41:50,980 --> 00:41:55,450
gotten more successful of late at hiding

1085
00:41:53,319 --> 00:41:59,470
stuff behind those sources<font color="#E5E5E5"> and those law</font>

00:41:59,470 --> 00:42:06,279
good question i don't think i think the

1088
00:42:01,660 --> 00:42:08,288
way to fight that battle<font color="#E5E5E5"> especially for</font>

about<font color="#E5E5E5"> these surveillance techniques is</font>

1098
00:42:26,109 --> 00:42:30,940
to really start pushing for<font color="#CCCCCC"> notice two</font>

who can do anything about it anyway and

1101
00:42:33,609 --> 00:42:37,119
I mean you know one of the nice things

1102
00:42:35,619 --> 00:42:39,039
about Daniel Rigmaiden<font color="#E5E5E5"> is you had a</font>

really smart defendant and you had

1104
00:42:39,039 --> 00:42:43,089
somebody who is persistent and willing

1105
00:42:40,599 --> 00:42:46,420
to fire lawyers to pursue this

1106
00:42:43,089 --> 00:42:48,519
most people who get caught with

1107

surveillance<font color="#CCCCCC"> aren't as smart</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> as he is</font>

00:42:52,569 --> 00:42:56,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">I mean they see more of this although</font>

what it is<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're being pushed into</font>

1113
00:42:59,499 --> 00:43:03,368
plea deals which means they often don't

1114

even get to the discovery<font color="#CCCCCC"> but really the</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">I think we will make more progress at</font>

00:43:05,859 --> 00:43:09,700
making sure criminal defendants get

discovery on all<font color="#CCCCCC"> of these techniques</font>

than<font color="#CCCCCC"> four and i was sad to say that but</font>

1119
00:43:12,339 --> 00:43:16,828
that's that's the reality

have any more information to elaborate

1126
00:43:30,569 --> 00:43:35,759
on services like<font color="#CCCCCC"> twilio or other like</font>

1127
00:43:33,569 --> 00:43:39,119
web-based services that provide such

1128
00:43:35,759 --> 00:43:41,789
services and how that has been looked at

1129
00:43:39,119 --> 00:43:44,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">within the intelligence community</font>

1131
00:43:44,430 --> 00:43:48,058
you're asking the question<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think is a</font>

1132
00:43:45,660 --> 00:43:51,660
sign that<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you can think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of we use</font>

00:43:51,660 --> 00:43:54,690
that's like if there would be a good

be a compelling answer but<font color="#CCCCCC"> i right</font>

1140
00:44:03,719 --> 00:44:11,400
hi<font color="#CCCCCC"> two questions first</font>

1141
00:44:08,819 --> 00:44:13,739
on the matter<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the postcard digits</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font>

1142
00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:17,700
you think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that there may be at least a</font>

1143
00:44:13,739 --> 00:44:20,910
legal analogy between<font color="#CCCCCC"> post all digits</font>

1144
00:44:17,700 --> 00:44:23,279
and the latter parts of<font color="#CCCCCC"> urls in browser</font>

1145
00:44:20,910 --> 00:44:26,069
<font color="#E5E5E5">histories</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> there may be usable by the</font>

1146
00:44:23,279 --> 00:44:28,799
government and the second is that there

1147
00:44:26,069 --> 00:44:31,558
is speculation in the horse that you may

1148
00:44:28,799 --> 00:44:35,430
in fact be a<font color="#E5E5E5"> super intelligence cyborg</font>

1149
00:44:31,559 --> 00:44:36,900
from the future sent back<font color="#E5E5E5"> to save us</font>

1150
00:44:35,430 --> 00:44:38,500
from the consequences of a mass

00:44:36,900 --> 00:44:44,470
surveillance system

1152
00:44:38,500 --> 00:44:47,560
<font color="#CCCCCC">I no wonder whether you could confirm or</font>

1153
00:44:44,470 --> 00:44:50,589
deny that on the record<font color="#CCCCCC"> i neither</font>

1154
00:44:47,560 --> 00:44:52,420
confirm nor deny that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm I you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know I</font>

1155
00:44:50,590 --> 00:44:55,420
actually I'm sort of curious<font color="#CCCCCC"> man why</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font>

1156
00:44:52,420 --> 00:44:57,040
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have any thought to that URL</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> content</font>

1157
00:44:55,420 --> 00:44:58,900
definitely<font color="#CCCCCC"> did</font>

1158
00:44:57,040 --> 00:45:01,150
did you hear<font color="#E5E5E5"> that so on the criminal</font>

1159
00:44:58,900 --> 00:45:03,280
side<font color="#E5E5E5"> but would that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> would that be</font>

1160
00:45:01,150 --> 00:45:03,850
counted as a post<font color="#E5E5E5"> cut through</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> probably</font>

1161
00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:10,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">not</font>

1162
00:45:03,850 --> 00:45:12,580
yeah so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> did you guys</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> gonna</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

1163
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:17,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">no repeat it</font>

1164
00:45:12,580 --> 00:45:18,370
yeah it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's complicated</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> answer</font>

1165
00:45:17,350 --> 00:45:19,660
<font color="#CCCCCC">huh</font>

1166
00:45:18,370 --> 00:45:22,299
and actually that's the name of our

00:45:19,660 --> 00:45:24,100
paper but it but<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> mean one thing that</font>

00:45:22,300 --> 00:45:25,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">I've I've sort of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> been curious on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

1169
00:45:24,100 --> 00:45:27,549
<font color="#E5E5E5">like I mean they're going to get the URL</font>

1170
00:45:25,720 --> 00:45:29,859
stuff anyway with ECT ours<font color="#CCCCCC"> we are going</font>

00:45:27,550 --> 00:45:32,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">to lose that fight and you know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I don't</font>

1172
00:45:29,860 --> 00:45:33,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">omit maybe you're more optimistic than</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

1173
00:45:32,110 --> 00:45:34,390
am but<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think we're going to lose</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

1174
00:45:33,100 --> 00:45:36,640

1175
00:45:34,390 --> 00:45:37,900
back to<font color="#E5E5E5"> getting that the things they're</font>

1178
00:45:39,310 --> 00:45:46,120
records include<font color="#CCCCCC"> URLs</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> include log data</font>

1179
00:45:43,270 --> 00:45:47,680
for websites include again<font color="#CCCCCC"> ask nick mara</font>

1180
00:45:46,120 --> 00:45:49,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">because he's like this all out he you</font>

00:45:47,680 --> 00:45:53,319
<font color="#CCCCCC">know spent years trying to trying to</font>

1183
00:45:53,320 --> 00:45:58,720
so it includes a ton of stuff which is

1184
00:45:56,650 --> 00:45:59,740
far more invasive than just email

1185
