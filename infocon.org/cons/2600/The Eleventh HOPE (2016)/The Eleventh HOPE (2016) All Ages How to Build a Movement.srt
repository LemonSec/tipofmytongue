00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:27,780
software movement needs to be diverse

36
00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:29,189
and inclusive to be successful and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

place

41
00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:39,600
what we're going to cover is<font color="#E5E5E5"> first why</font>

42
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:41,430
we care and we're going to talk a little

43
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:42,839
bit about what's going on with age<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

44
00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:45,630
then<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're going to discuss some of the</font>

45
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:48,509
solutions that we like to sort of fix

46
00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:49,949
some of the issues that are happening<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

47
00:01:48,509 --> 00:01:52,680
why do we care

48
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:55,200
well you<font color="#E5E5E5"> might have already guessed my</font>

00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:57,869
<font color="#E5E5E5">IRB free software nerds</font>

50
00:01:55,200 --> 00:02:01,259
<font color="#CCCCCC">ok there's a whole room of them and</font>

51
00:01:57,869 --> 00:02:02,430
neither of us are programmers but<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

00:02:01,259 --> 00:02:07,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">don't know cheers okay</font>

54
00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:15,359
<font color="#E5E5E5">anyway so um I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> my background</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is actually</font>

55
00:02:12,510 --> 00:02:16,799
in a different kinds of movements other

56
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:19,500
than free suffer and one of the things

57
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:21,000
that a lot of movements do well is

58
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:23,790
passed the torch from generation to

59
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:27,750
generation and<font color="#CCCCCC"> maintain sort of a common</font>

60
00:02:23,790 --> 00:02:30,329
thread of you know the ideals of the

61
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:31,980
movement and so we'd like to see how we

62
00:02:30,330 --> 00:02:35,970
could do a better job of doing that and

63
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:38,880
free suffer<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that means communicating</font>

64
00:02:35,970 --> 00:02:41,819
<font color="#E5E5E5">the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Y</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> free software not just the tools</font>

65
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:44,250
and to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> us the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> free</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the user</font>

66
00:02:41,819 --> 00:02:47,190
freedom aspect is the most important and

67
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:49,260
that means<font color="#E5E5E5"> uh you know talking about the</font>

68
00:02:47,190 --> 00:02:52,650
ideas<font color="#CCCCCC"> talking about the philosophy</font>

69
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:56,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">versus the development model it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

70
00:02:52,650 --> 00:02:59,190
great that collaborative work on<font color="#CCCCCC"> version</font>

71
00:02:56,190 --> 00:03:02,430
<font color="#CCCCCC">control</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> produces free software</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> but it's</font>

72
00:02:59,190 --> 00:03:04,500
not about the tools<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's about producing</font>

73
00:03:02,430 --> 00:03:06,120
software that empowers users should be

74
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:07,530
in charge of their computers<font color="#CCCCCC"> so that's</font>

75
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:09,330
what's important to us so that's why

76
00:03:07,530 --> 00:03:14,790
we're talking about this as a movement

77
00:03:09,330 --> 00:03:17,519
and not a business plan<font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> uh oh and</font>

78
00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:19,828
what's interesting about the tools and

79
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:21,360
the philosophies is the<font color="#CCCCCC"> philosophies</font>

80
00:03:19,829 --> 00:03:25,170
<font color="#CCCCCC">that is sort of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> feed each other like</font>

81
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:26,820
yeast and so there's a couple of other

82
00:03:25,170 --> 00:03:29,970
kind of nice<font color="#CCCCCC"> hippie things that we like</font>

83
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:31,108
that also tend to<font color="#CCCCCC"> a work to help us</font>

84
00:03:29,970 --> 00:03:33,600
build free<font color="#CCCCCC"> software still like</font>

85
00:03:31,109 --> 00:03:37,530
transparency and shared decision-making

86
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:40,260
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> consensus-driven organizations so</font>

87
00:03:37,530 --> 00:03:41,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> said communities of course need to</font>

88
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:44,790
focus on people especially if you're not

89
00:03:41,850 --> 00:03:46,440
paying them<font color="#E5E5E5"> you need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> make sure that</font>

90
00:03:44,790 --> 00:03:49,410
they're happy and that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're excited</font>

91
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:53,609
to be there and feeling valued and

92
00:03:49,410 --> 00:03:57,540
appreciated for their participation<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

93
00:03:53,609 --> 00:04:00,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">um and then tell me when we get to if</font>

94
00:03:57,540 --> 00:04:02,640
you can jump<font color="#E5E5E5"> in if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i forget stuff I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

95
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:04,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">then just to talk a little bit so a lot</font>

96
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:06,779
of folks have been really banging the

97
00:04:04,170 --> 00:04:09,268
drum about diversity which is not really

98
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:12,060
the same thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> is inclusivity</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

99
00:04:09,269 --> 00:04:14,970
diversity<font color="#CCCCCC"> uh</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> rather like the idea</font>

100
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:17,639
<font color="#E5E5E5">of a look it's an advertisement for</font>

101
00:04:14,970 --> 00:04:19,978
pants and we got a person from each race

102
00:04:17,639 --> 00:04:20,549

105
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:31,020
not really the same<font color="#E5E5E5"> inclusivity</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i have</font>

106
00:04:28,050 --> 00:04:33,419
been coming to prefer because<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's more</font>

107
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:36,568
including the idea that everyone should

108
00:04:33,419 --> 00:04:39,840
feel<font color="#E5E5E5"> welcome and that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> their</font>

111
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:53,159
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a lot of times we've been seeing</font>

112
00:04:50,610 --> 00:04:55,440
folks sell the idea of diversity is like

113
00:04:53,159 --> 00:04:58,319
<font color="#E5E5E5">oh</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it'd make smaller organizations it</font>

114
00:04:55,440 --> 00:05:00,090
makes better<font color="#E5E5E5"> projects it's it's like</font>

115
00:04:58,319 --> 00:05:03,659
it's good for you you know like kale or

116
00:05:00,090 --> 00:05:06,780
something like that and which<font color="#CCCCCC"> I I like</font>

117
00:05:03,659 --> 00:05:09,599
<font color="#CCCCCC">hell but um you know it's some of the</font>

118
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:10,979
studies<font color="#E5E5E5"> show that a diversity makes</font>

119
00:05:09,599 --> 00:05:13,680
people think about things differently

120
00:05:10,979 --> 00:05:15,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">and when you present an idea to someone</font>

121
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:16,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">who's not like you you tend to do a</font>

122
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:20,729
better job of preparing your arguments

123
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:24,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">and you also uh we also find that people</font>

124
00:05:20,729 --> 00:05:26,279
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> two</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are more likely to hear a</font>

125
00:05:24,030 --> 00:05:27,840
perspective that they disagree with from

126
00:05:26,279 --> 00:05:30,840
someone they don't perceive as being

127
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:33,179
like them so they uh<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's kind of like</font>

128
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:34,529
<font color="#E5E5E5">they sort of it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a suspect</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that there's</font>

129
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:35,969
something that they don't know and so

130
00:05:34,529 --> 00:05:41,069
they're more willing to listen

131
00:05:35,969 --> 00:05:42,120
so that's a no<font color="#E5E5E5"> which is all good and</font>

132
00:05:41,069 --> 00:05:45,539
helps you build a better organization

136
00:05:51,449 --> 00:05:55,080
point like tokenism is not helping you

137
00:05:53,550 --> 00:05:57,659
reap the benefits of a diverse

138

organization<font color="#CCCCCC"> so if you have someone come</font>

00:05:57,659 --> 00:06:01,620
in and you're like<font color="#CCCCCC"> oh em so we finally</font>

140
00:05:59,849 --> 00:06:03,840
got like someone from a group that we

141
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:06,029
don't have typically here and then you

142
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:07,710
have them like do some weird special

143
00:06:06,029 --> 00:06:09,479
project and they don't invite them to

144
00:06:07,710 --> 00:06:11,310
the meetings<font color="#CCCCCC"> more important discussions</font>

145

are happening<font color="#E5E5E5"> then you're not really</font>

00:06:11,310 --> 00:06:19,590
doing it so<font color="#E5E5E5"> so we would advocate for not</font>

147
00:06:17,969 --> 00:06:22,860
just following the letter of your

<font color="#E5E5E5">you know this is asking questions and</font>

155
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:39,489
listening to the answers and taking

156
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:42,280
advice from all of your team members

157
00:06:39,490 --> 00:06:44,410
which of course means inviting them and

158
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:46,599
including them<font color="#E5E5E5"> to you know with the</font>

159
00:06:44,410 --> 00:06:49,510
information and the meetings that they

160
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:51,070
need to be a part of<font color="#CCCCCC"> so another way that</font>

161
00:06:49,510 --> 00:06:53,680
you might think of this is shared power

162
00:06:51,070 --> 00:06:57,640
so if you have an<font color="#E5E5E5"> organization</font>

163
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:58,750
yeah well it might look like that<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's</font>

164
00:06:57,640 --> 00:07:02,830
not my office

165
00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:05,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">um</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is thinking that if you know if</font>

166
00:07:02,830 --> 00:07:07,810
you can get involved in the project up

167
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:11,020
to a<font color="#E5E5E5"> certain point and then there's sort</font>

168
00:07:07,810 --> 00:07:14,020
of this invisible glass ceiling of how

169
00:07:11,020 --> 00:07:16,090
far up you can go and how much power you

170
00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:17,650
can have within the<font color="#CCCCCC"> organization and</font>

171
00:07:16,090 --> 00:07:19,510
then when you start to look at who has

172
00:07:17,650 --> 00:07:21,969
power and who doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you have like</font>

173
00:07:19,510 --> 00:07:24,490
some of the same historical in equities

00:07:21,970 --> 00:07:29,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">being replicated within your project</font>

175
00:07:24,490 --> 00:07:32,140
then you have a problem so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and now</font>

176
00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:34,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">molly is going to talk about minorities</font>

177
00:07:32,140 --> 00:07:37,599
and tech or what<font color="#E5E5E5"> is intersectionality</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">who is a minority in tech</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I don't</font>

179
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:41,230
particularly like defining things by

180
00:07:39,580 --> 00:07:41,770
what they're not as opposed to what they

181
00:07:41,230 --> 00:07:43,630
are

182
00:07:41,770 --> 00:07:45,880
however in this particular case it is

183
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:47,320
much easier to define a minority and

184
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:49,300
tech<font color="#E5E5E5"> as someone who is not a</font>

what it's like in other countries so

00:07:51,970 --> 00:07:56,440
we're focusing on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> United States to</font>

189
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:59,530
be a little bit more specific this is a

190
00:07:56,440 --> 00:08:01,810
list of an incomplete list of some

191
00:07:59,530 --> 00:08:05,950
people who might be minorities within

192
00:08:01,810 --> 00:08:08,620
the sphere of<font color="#CCCCCC"> technology there's genders</font>

added<font color="#CCCCCC"> asked to square to remind us to</font>

195

mention that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know Deb and I are both</font>

00:08:13,870 --> 00:08:16,870
pretty white<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we feel pretty</font>

197
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:21,669
comfortable with that self-definition

00:08:16,870 --> 00:08:24,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">and we don't have experience</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> being</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> part</font>

did a really good job trying to find the

best terms we could to use<font color="#E5E5E5"> so we hope</font>

these are<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok and if you have any</font>

204
00:08:33,070 --> 00:08:36,910
suggestions for better ones<font color="#CCCCCC"> were totally</font>

00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:38,110
open to that<font color="#CCCCCC"> background is also meant to</font>

206
00:08:36,909 --> 00:08:40,809
convey that there are things that we

207
00:08:38,110 --> 00:08:42,640
can't see about one another that really

208
00:08:40,809 --> 00:08:45,550
do cause us to be minorities and

209
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:46,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">technical communities</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">um</font>

211
00:08:46,490 --> 00:08:50,420
these can be things like having

00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:51,829
disabilities<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it can be thinking</font>

213
00:08:50,420 --> 00:08:53,329
about your background so if you come

214
00:08:51,830 --> 00:08:54,830
from a working-class background your

215

to still find jobs<font color="#E5E5E5"> and technology even</font>

00:09:04,490 --> 00:09:10,130
if they don't have degrees that's less

true for women or people of color<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

intersectionality a<font color="#CCCCCC"> like just go back so</font>

223
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:16,970
it's really easy for someone to fit into

224
00:09:14,089 --> 00:09:20,180
more than one of these categories and

225
00:09:16,970 --> 00:09:25,310

have gotten history there

229
00:09:30,050 --> 00:09:37,490
um<font color="#CCCCCC"> about policies and mindsets and how</font>

230
00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:39,589
that causes us to create<font color="#CCCCCC"> a culture where</font>

231
00:09:37,490 --> 00:09:40,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">that's homogeneous right so when we want</font>

232
00:09:39,589 --> 00:09:42,860
to find someone who fits into the

233
00:09:40,970 --> 00:09:44,480
culture we already have<font color="#CCCCCC"> we look around</font>

234
00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:46,100
the room and we<font color="#CCCCCC"> talk to each other and</font>

235
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:47,990
then we look at people who have come to

236
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:49,399
visit us and we say<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so if you're</font>

237
00:09:47,990 --> 00:09:51,410
hiring for example these are the people

238
00:09:49,399 --> 00:09:52,970
who<font color="#CCCCCC"> have interviewed and you know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

239
00:09:51,410 --> 00:09:55,130
know John seems like a really good

240
00:09:52,970 --> 00:09:56,990
culture fit like we really<font color="#CCCCCC"> like John had</font>

241
00:09:55,130 --> 00:09:58,550
<font color="#CCCCCC">a good time talking with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> John and then</font>

242
00:09:56,990 --> 00:09:59,660
it simply<font color="#E5E5E5"> realize that you know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> John</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

243
00:09:58,550 --> 00:10:00,439
actually just like the rest of us

244
00:09:59,660 --> 00:10:03,890
already

245
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:05,839
<font color="#CCCCCC">um so these institutional mindsets are</font>

246
00:10:03,890 --> 00:10:08,360
the things that<font color="#CCCCCC"> cause us to continue to</font>

247
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:11,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">marginalize different groups and</font>

248
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:13,550
sometimes these groups<font color="#CCCCCC"> have the same</font>

249
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:15,230
needs and sometimes they don't

250
00:10:13,550 --> 00:10:17,479
so in this particular case we're going

251
00:10:15,230 --> 00:10:19,310
to be talking about ageism<font color="#E5E5E5"> and age and</font>

252
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:21,170
we need to remember that some of the

253
00:10:19,310 --> 00:10:22,849
things we're saying are really specific

254
00:10:21,170 --> 00:10:25,160
to people with age some of them are in

255
00:10:22,850 --> 00:10:28,010
general and talking about one issue

256
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:30,290
doesn't mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> no one else also faces</font>

257
00:10:28,010 --> 00:10:32,300
these things

258
00:10:30,290 --> 00:10:34,099
well<font color="#E5E5E5"> what's going on with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> each one</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">Harry uh first started playing Christian</font>

479
00:19:19,060 --> 00:19:21,909
was magically<font color="#E5E5E5"> wonderfully amazingly good</font>

480
00:19:21,190 --> 00:19:23,320
at it

481
00:19:21,910 --> 00:19:25,420
no one else was<font color="#CCCCCC"> they all have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to start</font>

482
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:27,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">working from a younger age they all had</font>

483
00:19:25,420 --> 00:19:29,470
to have people kind of come up to them

484
00:19:27,610 --> 00:19:32,229
and help them to teach them how to play

485
00:19:29,470 --> 00:19:34,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">they</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> needed to be encouraged</font>

486
00:19:32,230 --> 00:19:35,680
so we're looking at most young people

487
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:37,570
were really thinking about who needs to

488
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:39,610
be encouraged right so what do they need

489
00:19:37,570 --> 00:19:40,780
how do these people become hackers<font color="#CCCCCC"> right</font>

490
00:19:39,610 --> 00:19:42,340
so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first thing that you need to</font>

491
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:43,960
become a hacker is you need<font color="#E5E5E5"> a handle</font>

492
00:19:42,340 --> 00:19:45,059
<font color="#CCCCCC">without</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a handle you don't have an</font>

493
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:50,159
identity

494
00:19:45,059 --> 00:19:52,259
<font color="#CCCCCC">but once you have that you actually</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

495
00:19:50,159 --> 00:19:53,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">so for those of you who've seen hackers</font>

496
00:19:52,259 --> 00:19:56,580

amazing character and one of my favorite

498
00:19:56,580 --> 00:20:00,570
things about him actually he has such a

499
00:19:58,559 --> 00:20:03,450
great mentor network of people who are

500
00:20:00,570 --> 00:20:05,249
totally jerks to him but<font color="#CCCCCC"> they you know</font>

504
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:11,970
can tell when he's being universally

505
00:20:10,169 --> 00:20:14,009
stupid<font color="#E5E5E5"> but we can also help them</font>

506
00:20:11,970 --> 00:20:17,820
understand how to really become a good

507
00:20:14,009 --> 00:20:25,019
hacker into a righteous hack<font color="#CCCCCC"> umm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font>

510
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:33,059
job to make sure that there are spaces

511
00:20:30,269 --> 00:20:34,889
for younger people to have that support

512
00:20:33,059 --> 00:20:37,200
to have that encouragement and to have

513

of this<font color="#CCCCCC"> we didn't put a subversion</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one</font>

up but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll get to that in just a second</font>

523
00:20:57,029 --> 00:21:02,999

531
00:21:16,110 --> 00:21:19,769
they'll be projects that use these older

tools that no one else is using anymore

oh<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know what we should do we should</font>

561
00:22:29,049 --> 00:22:35,168
have like an older woman as a technical

00:22:50,649 --> 00:22:56,678
it is<font color="#E5E5E5"> purchased our cats character and</font>

572
00:23:00,070 --> 00:23:06,730
different technical women on TV<font color="#E5E5E5"> so uh</font>

573
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:09,490
you know this<font color="#E5E5E5"> this influences the</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">older women are capable of</font>

576
00:23:11,470 --> 00:23:15,039
it's hard for people to picture women in

577
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:16,210
a technical role because we almost never

578

see it

579
00:23:16,210 --> 00:23:22,779
so this is a<font color="#CCCCCC"> after i started looking at</font>

00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:25,720
the way that or the way that we don't

discrimination that seems to be socially

loudly complaining that they can't get

611
00:24:30,940 --> 00:24:37,899
then walks away so that that kind of

612
00:24:34,089 --> 00:24:40,119
thing is happening<font color="#CCCCCC"> so it's um you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

00:24:37,899 --> 00:24:42,609
<font color="#E5E5E5">where</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this it's it's for real</font>

it's really it's hard to get a job<font color="#CCCCCC"> even</font>

615
00:24:42,609 --> 00:24:46,599
<font color="#E5E5E5">in this time where we don't have enough</font>

people to do the work that companies

617
00:24:46,599 --> 00:24:52,208
want to pay people to do another thing

618
00:24:49,299 --> 00:24:53,349
that happens is that a lot of the older

619
00:24:52,209 --> 00:24:55,899
women i was talking to over the years

620
00:24:53,349 --> 00:24:57,759
have gone ahead and move out of<font color="#E5E5E5"> tech</font>

621
00:24:55,899 --> 00:25:01,238
<font color="#E5E5E5">they're like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> yep</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> too old for this shit</font>

622
00:24:57,759 --> 00:25:03,699
<font color="#CCCCCC">so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you know they</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they found themselves</font>

623
00:25:01,239 --> 00:25:06,639
either like<font color="#E5E5E5"> putting up with a lot of you</font>

624
00:25:03,699 --> 00:25:09,190
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> silliness or you know just outright</font>

625
00:25:06,639 --> 00:25:11,859
discrimination or<font color="#CCCCCC"> the kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of like found</font>

626
00:25:09,190 --> 00:25:13,779
themselves not being a you know included

627
00:25:11,859 --> 00:25:16,299
in technical<font color="#E5E5E5"> decision making processes</font>

628
00:25:13,779 --> 00:25:18,249
and so it's not that they're going off

629
00:25:16,299 --> 00:25:20,589
to raise families it's that they're just

630
00:25:18,249 --> 00:25:24,039
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> no I cannot put up with this</font>

631
00:25:20,589 --> 00:25:25,448
<font color="#CCCCCC">so and some of this is due to agent</font>

632
00:25:24,039 --> 00:25:28,658
<font color="#CCCCCC">someone this is due to gender like I</font>

633
00:25:25,449 --> 00:25:32,049
said it<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of the intersectional thing</font>

634
00:25:28,659 --> 00:25:34,749
that happens<font color="#E5E5E5"> they said it's sort of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> yeah</font>

635
00:25:32,049 --> 00:25:36,639
<font color="#E5E5E5">they interact in a way that's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that adds</font>

636
00:25:34,749 --> 00:25:40,959
up to a lot of bullshit

637
00:25:36,639 --> 00:25:42,428
<font color="#E5E5E5">so uh and then this is another woman</font>

638
00:25:40,959 --> 00:25:44,709
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I spoke to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> who works as a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> software</font>

that she found herself she was staying

00:25:46,869 --> 00:25:53,379
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> tech but found herself basically like</font>

00:25:55,149 --> 00:26:02,258
own projects<font color="#E5E5E5"> so it's not it's not it's</font>

645
00:25:59,799 --> 00:26:03,729
not so surprising that people are

646
00:26:02,259 --> 00:26:06,579
leaving when they get to a certain age

647
00:26:03,729 --> 00:26:08,079

the work that you would rather be doing

651
00:26:14,620 --> 00:26:21,610
and it's not surprising that you decide

652
00:26:16,270 --> 00:26:23,650
to leave eventually<font color="#CCCCCC"> so I think ah cool</font>

kind of this idea that you stand up and

hang back and let someone else be the

person that stands up and talks about it

1047

of projects are not very welcoming to

1071
00:43:08,119 --> 00:43:13,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">and big conversation and really would</font>

1072
00:43:12,049 --> 00:43:15,859
<font color="#E5E5E5">we're thinking about is how you get</font>

1073
00:43:13,790 --> 00:43:17,029
people involved at all levels and what

1074
00:43:15,859 --> 00:43:19,040
we're interested in is getting people

1075
00:43:17,030 --> 00:43:20,420
who<font color="#CCCCCC"> are involved wherever they are on</font>

1076
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:22,970
board with the ideas<font color="#CCCCCC"> they will have them</font>

1077
00:43:20,420 --> 00:43:25,849
to drink the<font color="#E5E5E5"> kool-aid</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so getting people</font>

1078
00:43:22,970 --> 00:43:27,799
to come into your<font color="#E5E5E5"> product so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm going</font>

1079
00:43:25,849 --> 00:43:30,079
<font color="#CCCCCC">to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> use media</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> goblin as an example assam</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">goblin is actually really great at</font>

1082
00:43:31,640 --> 00:43:35,509
getting young people or anyone really

00:43:33,619 --> 00:43:36,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">knew</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to show up to empower them to step</font>

1084
00:43:35,510 --> 00:43:39,920
back to let them

00:43:36,500 --> 00:43:41,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">take control of things and we like that</font>

1086
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:43,730
now we also need to get the rest of the

1087
00:43:41,600 --> 00:43:47,299
movement doing that as a whole and it's

1088
00:43:43,730 --> 00:43:50,630
a pretty big spectrum at that point

1089
00:43:47,300 --> 00:43:52,580
yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> so a lot of communication platforms</font>

1090
00:43:50,630 --> 00:43:54,950
on the internet especially the ones that

1091
00:43:52,580 --> 00:43:56,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">non-technical contributors</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are people</font>

1096
00:44:05,060 --> 00:44:09,140

1097
00:44:07,220 --> 00:44:11,629
interacts with getting younger

00:44:11,630 --> 00:44:14,930

do you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have thoughts on this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I do</font>

take that if a child is going to get

1141
00:45:53,780 --> 00:45:57,380
whole nother set of conversations if we

1142
00:45:55,520 --> 00:45:59,390
want to talk about like what it means to

1143
00:45:57,380 --> 00:46:00,950
be involved with one and like what kind

1144
00:45:59,390 --> 00:46:02,990
of resources are available for that and

1145
00:46:00,950 --> 00:46:03,740
I'm gonna stop talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about that right</font>

ways to get to get like younger children

1151
00:46:15,830 --> 00:46:19,009
outside of events is definitely a good

1152
00:46:17,240 --> 00:46:21,500
question<font color="#E5E5E5"> to think about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i would</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> love to</font>

1153
00:46:19,010 --> 00:46:23,000
hear more about how we as communities

1154
00:46:21,500 --> 00:46:25,310
can empower kids who don't have the

1155
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:26,870
technical parents because they have so

1156

much potential and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I've met great people</font>
