additionally we as fans have created our

that they were going to have to

know I<font color="#E5E5E5"> could persuade them for a little</font>

343
00:16:55,740 --> 00:17:04,050
that i did with using pods in a particle

344
00:17:00,330 --> 00:17:07,290
synthesis demonstration which involves

345
00:17:04,050 --> 00:17:09,359
<font color="#E5E5E5">grains of micro sound in which three</font>

346
00:17:07,290 --> 00:17:10,800
pods with multiple particle objects have

347
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:14,639
been programmed to interact with each

348
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:17,490
other and through these interactions we

349
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:20,819
three we see three aspects of behavior

350
00:17:17,490 --> 00:17:23,819
what<font color="#CCCCCC"> I call</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> behavioral glitch so I'm</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> mm</font>

351
00:17:20,819 --> 00:17:26,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">this is sort of my you know example of</font>

352
00:17:23,819 --> 00:17:28,560
how using the tools in a way<font color="#E5E5E5"> they</font>

353
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:31,080
weren't intended<font color="#E5E5E5"> for and if you'll see</font>

354
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:33,450
progressively over the<font color="#E5E5E5"> the course of</font>

355
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:34,919
looking at the three pods that they they

356
00:17:33,450 --> 00:17:38,880
do different things

357
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:41,280
<font color="#CCCCCC">ok so let</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> me just pan out here so you</font>

358
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:42,570
can see this is the controlling<font color="#E5E5E5"> later we</font>

359
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:46,170
were talking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> chris is going to</font>

360
00:17:42,570 --> 00:17:48,929
demonstrate this actually on after me in

361
00:17:46,170 --> 00:17:51,990
his game map<font color="#CCCCCC"> but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this is sort of you</font>

362
00:17:48,930 --> 00:17:55,200
know these are micro<font color="#CCCCCC"> tricks that you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font>

363
00:17:51,990 --> 00:17:59,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">endowed with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> me behaviour or any I have</font>

364
00:17:55,200 --> 00:18:04,590
one for each pod<font color="#E5E5E5"> so that's one that's</font>

365
00:17:59,430 --> 00:18:06,570
one<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that's one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> out there but i'm</font>

368
00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:15,629
look at it if we have time we'll go back

369
00:18:10,650 --> 00:18:16,770
and look at a little more closely<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

370
00:18:15,630 --> 00:18:20,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'll show them to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> first and then</font>

371
00:18:16,770 --> 00:18:22,560
<font color="#CCCCCC">i'll</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about each one so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm gonna</font>

their material and and adding the water

403
00:23:31,750 --> 00:23:36,070
was just sort of like adding another

complex element<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to to an</font>

406
00:23:39,250 --> 00:23:42,430
first one is just sort of like an

407
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:45,550
example of like some glitching sound

408
00:23:42,430 --> 00:23:48,100
obviously clicking is really<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm</font>

00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:53,889
a lot of electronic musicians<font color="#E5E5E5"> know when</font>

412
00:23:53,890 --> 00:23:58,450
then the second pod was more about how

sometimes<font color="#E5E5E5"> some if you saw three or four</font>

419
00:24:09,850 --> 00:24:14,590
of them just kind of bonding and like

420
00:24:11,650 --> 00:24:15,520
you know kind of like shaking out of

421
00:24:14,590 --> 00:24:18,550
control

422
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:20,290
that's sort of on an emergent behavior i

423
00:24:18,550 --> 00:24:23,500
think that came out of just you know

424
00:24:20,290 --> 00:24:25,960
putting those specific behaviors<font color="#CCCCCC"> onto</font>

straightforward just full<font color="#E5E5E5"> overload see</font>

434
00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:49,799
what<font color="#CCCCCC"> I could do and you know it is kind</font>

435
00:24:47,250 --> 00:24:51,510
of subtle<font color="#CCCCCC"> but and you know the the</font>

438
00:24:54,299 --> 00:24:57,540
it was<font color="#CCCCCC"> kinda cool to see all of those</font>

439
00:24:55,710 --> 00:24:59,190
little objects<font color="#CCCCCC"> to after like really</font>

440
00:24:57,540 --> 00:25:02,730
satisfying for me at the end of it all

441
00:24:59,190 --> 00:25:05,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">but that you know is essentially just</font>

the<font color="#CCCCCC"> bases and it's just a very basic</font>

443
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:07,980
example I think that's pretty

straightforward when it comes to this

445

oh cool<font color="#CCCCCC"> well I will definitely have to</font>

so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm going to talk a little bit about</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">since it's a hackers conference talk a</font>

little bit about hacking game engines

528
00:30:53,330 --> 00:30:59,629
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean just to give you a little bit</font>

529
00:30:54,979 --> 00:31:03,559
of perspective<font color="#E5E5E5"> for a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in to create</font>

530
00:30:59,629 --> 00:31:05,570
context for what we do now<font color="#CCCCCC"> so I kind of</font>

531
00:31:03,559 --> 00:31:08,359
<font color="#E5E5E5">work start working machinima I don't</font>

machine so<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> define machinima</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font>

534
00:31:10,970 --> 00:31:14,539
<font color="#E5E5E5">machine is the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> real time</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the use of</font>

535
00:31:12,739 --> 00:31:16,700
real-time computer graphics engines or

536
00:31:14,539 --> 00:31:19,039
video game engines to create a cinematic

537
00:31:16,700 --> 00:31:21,529
production can be narrative or can be

538
00:31:19,039 --> 00:31:23,149
more experimental<font color="#E5E5E5"> like video art there's</font>

539
00:31:21,529 --> 00:31:24,379
been a lot of different types<font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font>

540
00:31:23,149 --> 00:31:26,599
basically the big thing that

541
00:31:24,379 --> 00:31:28,369
differentiated from like<font color="#CCCCCC"> speedruns and</font>

542
00:31:26,599 --> 00:31:30,979
various other types of recorded<font color="#E5E5E5"> game</font>

543
00:31:28,369 --> 00:31:33,678
material or let's play videos now you

544
00:31:30,979 --> 00:31:37,549
see a lot of those on<font color="#CCCCCC"> youtube is the</font>

545
00:31:33,679 --> 00:31:40,220
narrative aspect<font color="#E5E5E5"> so in 1996 there</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is a</font>

video<font color="#E5E5E5"> called diary of a camper made by</font>

549
00:31:44,389 --> 00:31:50,269
have ever looked up machinima<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it was</font>

550
00:31:48,349 --> 00:31:53,149
the first time that basically quick<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

551
00:31:50,269 --> 00:31:55,580
software built into the game quake<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

552
00:31:53,149 --> 00:31:57,289
feature that<font color="#E5E5E5"> allows you to save the data</font>

553
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:59,658
from your game<font color="#E5E5E5"> from your</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> death match</font>

554
00:31:57,289 --> 00:32:02,029
<font color="#E5E5E5">essentially right</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and you couldn't share</font>

555
00:31:59,659 --> 00:32:03,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">those the data it wasn't a video file is</font>

556
00:32:02,029 --> 00:32:06,349
just data if you loaded it into your

557
00:32:03,710 --> 00:32:08,509
game engine<font color="#CCCCCC"> your quake</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> game it would</font>

558
00:32:06,349 --> 00:32:11,389
play back the same match that that

559
00:32:08,509 --> 00:32:14,869
person had<font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> essentially was like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> video</font>

560
00:32:11,389 --> 00:32:16,158
and there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> whole conceptual</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> aspects</font>

561
00:32:14,869 --> 00:32:17,599
<font color="#CCCCCC">of the difference between those two</font>

562
00:32:16,159 --> 00:32:19,159
things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I did</font>

563
00:32:17,599 --> 00:32:21,529
<font color="#CCCCCC">obviously this is not the day to do that</font>

564
00:32:19,159 --> 00:32:23,179
but<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's super interesting that</font>

565
00:32:21,529 --> 00:32:24,840
you have you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know video is very linear</font>

566
00:32:23,179 --> 00:32:26,309
and data

567
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:27,959
you know it still<font color="#CCCCCC"> is basically playing</font>

568
00:32:26,309 --> 00:32:30,450
back in a linear fashion fashion but

569
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:32,429
<font color="#CCCCCC">it's really creating the entire thing on</font>

570
00:32:30,450 --> 00:32:35,130
the fly<font color="#E5E5E5"> as opposed to having it frozen</font>

571
00:32:32,429 --> 00:32:39,630
in the media<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that in the usual sense</font>

572
00:32:35,130 --> 00:32:42,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">so just the possible that the fact that</font>

573
00:32:39,630 --> 00:32:44,130
it put that feature in the game was very

574
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:47,309
<font color="#CCCCCC">forward-thinking they realized at that</font>

575
00:32:44,130 --> 00:32:49,950
time in<font color="#E5E5E5"> 1996 long time ago right</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 30</font>

576
00:32:47,309 --> 00:32:50,940
years<font color="#E5E5E5"> ago</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> talking</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> every</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 20 20 of my math</font>

577
00:32:49,950 --> 00:32:53,520
is really good

578
00:32:50,940 --> 00:32:57,090
<font color="#CCCCCC">this is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> why</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm not a programmer so they</font>

579
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:58,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">realize</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> even back then that that</font>

580
00:32:57,090 --> 00:33:00,330
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> was something that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that gamers want</font>

581
00:32:58,950 --> 00:33:02,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">to like they're gonna</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> want to be able to</font>

582
00:33:00,330 --> 00:33:03,629
record their games and do things with

583
00:33:02,370 --> 00:33:04,949
them and it basically extend the shelf

584
00:33:03,630 --> 00:33:07,169
life of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> games you know people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> will</font>

585
00:33:04,950 --> 00:33:08,399
be interested<font color="#CCCCCC"> in for longer if you know</font>

586
00:33:07,169 --> 00:33:12,270
they could do more stuff with it besides

587
00:33:08,399 --> 00:33:13,770
play it so that basically gave birth to

588
00:33:12,270 --> 00:33:18,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">machinima what we now know is machinima</font>

589
00:33:13,770 --> 00:33:21,299
and that's had a weird<font color="#CCCCCC"> past but but</font>

590
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:22,289
essentially it's interesting that it

591
00:33:21,299 --> 00:33:24,299
started

592
00:33:22,289 --> 00:33:25,408
not necessarily<font color="#E5E5E5"> from a hack</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I mean</font>

593
00:33:24,299 --> 00:33:27,029
there's a hack in the sense that they

594
00:33:25,409 --> 00:33:30,179
were thinking about a game differently

595
00:33:27,029 --> 00:33:31,260
when they made that video<font color="#CCCCCC"> i could</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> show</font>

596
00:33:30,179 --> 00:33:32,789
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> a little piece of it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i want to just</font>

597
00:33:31,260 --> 00:33:34,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">do that real quick</font>

598
00:33:32,789 --> 00:33:36,059
it's not it's not very interesting by

599
00:33:34,950 --> 00:33:38,279
today's standards it's interesting

600
00:33:36,059 --> 00:33:40,559
mostly<font color="#CCCCCC"> in that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's really really low</font>

601
00:33:38,279 --> 00:33:43,409
poly<font color="#E5E5E5"> so you don't see that much anymore</font>

602
00:33:40,559 --> 00:33:43,860
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i guess i just have to drag it over</font>

603
00:33:43,409 --> 00:33:48,299
there

604
00:33:43,860 --> 00:33:50,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">yeah</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so you probably</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can't see that it's</font>

605
00:33:48,299 --> 00:33:52,889
so it's so<font color="#E5E5E5"> low poly putting to get</font>

606
00:33:50,250 --> 00:33:57,690
enough light pixels to actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> describe</font>

607
00:33:52,890 --> 00:33:58,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">objects very well but this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is this is</font>

608
00:33:57,690 --> 00:34:04,919
what<font color="#CCCCCC"> quake</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> looked</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like it was very</font>

609
00:33:58,980 --> 00:34:07,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">really game</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> early</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a 3d game so it's kind</font>

610
00:34:04,919 --> 00:34:09,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">of beautiful in its own way I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you would</font>

611
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:11,159
not know that there was a story<font color="#E5E5E5"> here</font>

612
00:34:09,210 --> 00:34:12,990
unless you watch<font color="#E5E5E5"> the whole thing but let</font>

613
00:34:11,159 --> 00:34:16,830
me just take it from me there's a story

614
00:34:12,989 --> 00:34:18,629
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> so I so I think what's interesting</font>

615
00:34:16,830 --> 00:34:20,460
there is that<font color="#CCCCCC"> it was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there they they're</font>

616
00:34:18,629 --> 00:34:21,868
adding the story element to it was a

617
00:34:20,460 --> 00:34:24,149
sort of a<font color="#E5E5E5"> hack was a hack</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the way</font>

618
00:34:21,869 --> 00:34:26,010
they were thinking about video games<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

619
00:34:24,149 --> 00:34:28,138
concept of<font color="#CCCCCC"> attack</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the concept of video</font>

620
00:34:26,010 --> 00:34:30,179
games<font color="#CCCCCC"> as</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if you will but it was also</font>

621
00:34:28,139 --> 00:34:32,010
enabled by its software building that

622
00:34:30,179 --> 00:34:34,050
feature into the game so<font color="#CCCCCC"> right from</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

623
00:34:32,010 --> 00:34:36,480
birth of machinima<font color="#CCCCCC"> there</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was this duel</font>

624
00:34:34,050 --> 00:34:38,149
force that came that propelled forward

625
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:39,469
one was the users

626
00:34:38,149 --> 00:34:41,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">wanting to hack it and do more with it</font>

627
00:34:39,469 --> 00:34:42,799
and the other was the<font color="#CCCCCC"> company's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> trying</font>

628
00:34:41,210 --> 00:34:46,668
to keep up with what they were doing

629
00:34:42,799 --> 00:34:48,109
<font color="#E5E5E5">I within the realm that would not upset</font>

630
00:34:46,668 --> 00:34:50,000
their lawyers<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's the other thing</font>

631
00:34:48,109 --> 00:34:51,918
which<font color="#CCCCCC"> I've</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> gone into in detail in the</font>

632
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:55,429
past but<font color="#E5E5E5"> what kind of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> skip</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> over that for</font>

633
00:34:51,918 --> 00:34:58,490
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> the sake of this talk</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so jumping</font>

634
00:34:55,429 --> 00:35:01,490
forward a almost like nine years<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

635
00:34:58,490 --> 00:35:03,649
2005 i started a<font color="#E5E5E5"> video series on the</font>

636
00:35:01,490 --> 00:35:05,029
internet called the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Spartan life and it</font>

637
00:35:03,650 --> 00:35:07,430
began with a hack

638
00:35:05,029 --> 00:35:09,589
<font color="#E5E5E5">I in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Halo</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to the only way to get a</font>

639
00:35:07,430 --> 00:35:10,879
camera mode you couldn't like film you

640
00:35:09,589 --> 00:35:12,890
know you couldn't really film you could

641
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:15,049
<font color="#E5E5E5">film the game if you got the output of</font>

642
00:35:12,890 --> 00:35:17,210
the video<font color="#E5E5E5"> but you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> would I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have a gun</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

643
00:35:15,049 --> 00:35:19,369
your way<font color="#E5E5E5"> right</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so somebody figured out</font>

644
00:35:17,210 --> 00:35:21,589
if you pick up a skull that in this one

645
00:35:19,369 --> 00:35:23,059
game called<font color="#E5E5E5"> oddball and you press this</font>

646
00:35:21,589 --> 00:35:25,400
button and you fire your gun at the same

647
00:35:23,059 --> 00:35:27,260
time you<font color="#E5E5E5"> drop the skull and the gun and</font>

648
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:29,270
you have a completely clear view which

649
00:35:27,260 --> 00:35:31,069
essentially is a camera right so we

650
00:35:29,270 --> 00:35:32,420
would get<font color="#CCCCCC"> to people in the game have</font>

651
00:35:31,069 --> 00:35:34,130
them do that<font color="#E5E5E5"> to every time at the</font>

be moving around as the host of the show

they would be the guests<font color="#E5E5E5"> so the two</font>

us around videotaping<font color="#E5E5E5"> us essentially so</font>

664
00:35:56,569 --> 00:36:01,460
it started with a hack and<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Halo 3</font>

666
00:36:01,460 --> 00:36:05,900
because they could<font color="#CCCCCC"> and theater mode was</font>

667
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:07,339
sort of like an update of what<font color="#CCCCCC"> its</font>

668
00:36:05,900 --> 00:36:10,730
software did with<font color="#E5E5E5"> quake where you could</font>

669
00:36:07,339 --> 00:36:12,440
basically record the game data<font color="#E5E5E5"> so every</font>

00:36:10,730 --> 00:36:14,690
bullet that's fired every person that

runs this way that way<font color="#CCCCCC"> the look of their</font>

their avatar

673
00:36:16,220 --> 00:36:19,910
everything is remembered in data and

674
00:36:18,410 --> 00:36:21,529
then you can play it back

675
00:36:19,910 --> 00:36:23,029
<font color="#CCCCCC">what what what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they call film clips</font>

676
00:36:21,529 --> 00:36:24,920
which is a really weird title for

677
00:36:23,029 --> 00:36:26,240
something that's absolutely digital<font color="#E5E5E5"> they</font>

678
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:29,660
just decided to call<font color="#E5E5E5"> film clips because</font>

00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:31,339
<font color="#E5E5E5">hey let's go</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> old school you know and and</font>

680
00:36:29,660 --> 00:36:34,430
then you could stop it started let me

681
00:36:31,339 --> 00:36:35,299
just<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a theater mode</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> clip here</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

so this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> rishi</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that the couple</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> numbers</font>

692
00:36:57,440 --> 00:37:04,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">can attach to your avatar and NT</font>

you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> let the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> game playback the D</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

697
00:37:13,530 --> 00:37:17,730
you can basically create<font color="#CCCCCC"> your</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in our in</font>

698
00:37:16,110 --> 00:37:19,440
our case we did an interview right we

699
00:37:17,730 --> 00:37:20,310
didn't actually play the game<font color="#E5E5E5"> where</font>

700
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:21,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">you're supposed to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just did an</font>

701
00:37:20,310 --> 00:37:22,860
interview in the game we should each

702
00:37:21,540 --> 00:37:24,960
other and blow things up and all that

703
00:37:22,860 --> 00:37:28,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">because</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's fun but we then replay that</font>

704
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:30,360
game and connect the output<font color="#E5E5E5"> to you know</font>

705
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:32,610
digitizer<font color="#CCCCCC"> Treadwell essentially a</font>

706
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:34,320
capture box right and we capture the

707
00:37:32,610 --> 00:37:36,360
video one shot at a time so we get a

708
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:37,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">long shot of each scene that we move in</font>

709
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:38,970
for close-ups just the way you doing a

710
00:37:37,770 --> 00:37:40,800
film right

711
00:37:38,970 --> 00:37:43,020
the nice thing about it is that all the

712
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:43,980
acting and and and blocking has already

713
00:37:43,020 --> 00:37:46,020
been done

714
00:37:43,980 --> 00:37:47,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">the camera person doesn't have to you</font>

715
00:37:46,020 --> 00:37:50,430
<font color="#CCCCCC">know worry about what I got the shot</font>

716
00:37:47,790 --> 00:37:51,810
right<font color="#E5E5E5"> but the actor messed it up you</font>

717
00:37:50,430 --> 00:37:53,399
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> you've already got you already know</font>

718
00:37:51,810 --> 00:37:55,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">where</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> your good takes for the acting or</font>

719
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:57,150
the moving around it are<font color="#E5E5E5"> and all you</font>

720
00:37:55,590 --> 00:38:00,090
have to do is worry about the camera

721
00:37:57,150 --> 00:38:01,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">I'm so basically so essentially the same</font>

722
00:38:00,090 --> 00:38:04,140
thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> happened there right is it started</font>

723
00:38:01,770 --> 00:38:06,540
with a glitch<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it became a feature</font>

724
00:38:04,140 --> 00:38:08,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">and that's kind of the dual nature of</font>

725
00:38:06,540 --> 00:38:10,980
machinima and a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> game hacking is</font>

726
00:38:08,850 --> 00:38:12,720
that you know people want to push the

727
00:38:10,980 --> 00:38:14,670
<font color="#CCCCCC">the system's further because they can</font>

728
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:17,279
write these the really complex systems

729
00:38:14,670 --> 00:38:18,870
and the game companies want to help them

730
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:20,400
do it because it extends the shelf life

731
00:38:18,870 --> 00:38:21,750
of the game but they all<font color="#CCCCCC"> wanted</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> also</font>

732
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:23,100
want to be careful about the legalities

733
00:38:21,750 --> 00:38:24,900
involved

734
00:38:23,100 --> 00:38:27,630
bullshit<font color="#CCCCCC"> i call but you know that's the</font>

735
00:38:24,900 --> 00:38:29,850
way they are so<font color="#CCCCCC"> so i'm going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to jump</font>

736
00:38:27,630 --> 00:38:31,260
forward now<font color="#CCCCCC"> I basically I'm just going</font>

737
00:38:29,850 --> 00:38:38,430
<font color="#CCCCCC">to try to trim some of this</font>

738
00:38:31,260 --> 00:38:42,690
so in what<font color="#CCCCCC"> was it 2010 littlebigplanet</font>

00:38:38,430 --> 00:38:44,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">10</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> something like that 2008</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> wow so the</font>

740
00:38:42,690 --> 00:38:45,420
first<font color="#CCCCCC"> littlebigplanet was maybe 2008</font>

741
00:38:44,250 --> 00:38:46,770
somewhere thereabouts<font color="#E5E5E5"> for some reason</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

742
00:38:45,420 --> 00:38:50,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">didn't bother</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> look that up</font>

743
00:38:46,770 --> 00:38:52,380
five minutes<font color="#E5E5E5"> eight</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> minutes ok so I'm</font>

744
00:38:50,370 --> 00:38:54,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to just jump in real quick into</font>

745
00:38:52,380 --> 00:38:55,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">littlebigplanet i'm gonna</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> show you kind</font>

746
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:58,140
of how<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> done</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> already seen a little</font>

747
00:38:55,710 --> 00:39:02,280
bit what time<font color="#CCCCCC"> i showed you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> kind</font>

748
00:38:58,140 --> 00:39:09,000
of come pretty far since then

749
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:11,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm gonna go down</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there would you</font>

750
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:34,360
just keep your finger on this<font color="#E5E5E5"> helps load</font>

751
00:39:11,700 --> 00:39:39,040
map<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> were so close</font>

752
00:39:34,360 --> 00:39:40,660
<font color="#CCCCCC">ok I'm back</font>

753
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:42,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">so this might take a few minutes load</font>

754
00:39:40,660 --> 00:39:44,379
it's a very very big map so one of the

755
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:46,630
things first<font color="#CCCCCC"> I should tell you what this</font>

756
00:39:44,380 --> 00:39:48,760
is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to time and I've</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> been</font>

757
00:39:46,630 --> 00:39:50,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">doing these kind of conceptual art</font>

758
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:53,200
pieces and in in littlebigplanet for<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

759
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:54,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">while we really like that and I kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">it before that I'd done</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the spotlight</font>

761
00:39:54,850 --> 00:39:58,839
which<font color="#E5E5E5"> was more of a talk show is kind of</font>

762
00:39:56,620 --> 00:40:01,210
more of a narrative<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's a little</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bit</font>

763
00:39:58,840 --> 00:40:02,350
more straightforward<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I just keep</font>

764
00:40:01,210 --> 00:40:03,880
kind of bouncing between those two

765
00:40:02,350 --> 00:40:05,950
extremes and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I thought what am I try to</font>

766
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:09,820
find them<font color="#CCCCCC"> could happy middle ground</font>

767
00:40:05,950 --> 00:40:13,029
where it's still pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> conceptually odd</font>

768
00:40:09,820 --> 00:40:14,950
but it's understandable and it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> form</font>

769
00:40:13,030 --> 00:40:18,190
that people might get so for some reason

770
00:40:14,950 --> 00:40:21,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">I decide to make a musical</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

771
00:40:18,190 --> 00:40:24,940
essentially<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> go over</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> here</font>

772
00:40:21,220 --> 00:40:26,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">yeah</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so this is essentially i'm not</font>

773
00:40:24,940 --> 00:40:27,670
going to sing with this but normally

774
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:29,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">there'd be three singers on the stage</font>

775
00:40:27,670 --> 00:40:31,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">and what you're seeing will be the the</font>

776
00:40:29,470 --> 00:40:35,290
backdrop essentially the scenery

777
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:36,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">ok I haven't done this in about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> four</font>

778
00:40:35,290 --> 00:40:39,220
months so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> probably gonna mess it up</font>

779
00:40:36,970 --> 00:40:41,799
<font color="#CCCCCC">but you probably won't even notice</font>

780
00:40:39,220 --> 00:40:43,689
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay so everything you see in here is</font>

781
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:45,430
done in the game<font color="#CCCCCC"> including the music</font>

782
00:40:43,690 --> 00:40:46,690

00:49:16,110 --> 00:49:21,030
when it comes to how should it be sold

916
00:49:18,510 --> 00:49:26,130
how should<font color="#E5E5E5"> it be displayed in museums</font>

917
00:49:21,030 --> 00:49:28,410
archived<font color="#CCCCCC"> I mean you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can we can't</font>

918
00:49:26,130 --> 00:49:32,430
really sell these works<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> haven't tried</font>

919
00:49:28,410 --> 00:49:34,350
yet but you know they<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean it's</font>

920
00:49:32,430 --> 00:49:36,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">extreme</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> anyone spoken I guess we have</font>

921
00:49:34,350 --> 00:49:38,040
spoken Media Molecule maybe about<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

922
00:49:36,600 --> 00:49:39,839
trying to get some of our work out there

923
00:49:38,040 --> 00:49:41,250
and they think<font color="#E5E5E5"> what we do is interesting</font>

924
00:49:39,840 --> 00:49:45,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">Media Molecule</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> being the initial</font>

925
00:49:41,250 --> 00:49:48,480
developer but<font color="#CCCCCC"> i don't actually really</font>

926
00:49:45,570 --> 00:49:50,820
know we we do perform it mostly we

927
00:49:48,480 --> 00:49:53,610
haven't made<font color="#CCCCCC"> dvds yet but we were</font>

928
00:49:50,820 --> 00:49:55,590
actually thinking about that right yeah

929
00:49:53,610 --> 00:49:57,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">and yeah if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I can just jump and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

930
00:49:55,590 --> 00:49:59,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">briefly I you know I think that</font>

931
00:49:57,360 --> 00:50:01,770
preserving this in video is is one thing

932
00:49:59,820 --> 00:50:03,300
that we definitely do but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it as you can</font>

933
00:50:01,770 --> 00:50:05,370
see it's just not the same i mean i

934
00:50:03,300 --> 00:50:06,540
don't know how much you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can see what</font>

935
00:50:05,370 --> 00:50:08,250
time and I were doing the<font color="#E5E5E5"> controllers</font>

936
00:50:06,540 --> 00:50:11,100
but this is very performative work<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font>

937
00:50:08,250 --> 00:50:12,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">it's it I messed up a bunch</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> accused in</font>

938
00:50:11,100 --> 00:50:14,950
that last thing you probably that when

939
00:50:12,840 --> 00:50:16,690
the toaster was blowing that dude away

940
00:50:14,950 --> 00:50:19,240
it was supposed to destroy that last

941
00:50:16,690 --> 00:50:20,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">wall I like didn't hit the the tag</font>

942
00:50:19,240 --> 00:50:23,410
sensor<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the right angle and it just</font>

943
00:50:20,950 --> 00:50:24,939
didn't destroy the wall<font color="#E5E5E5"> so you know it</font>

944
00:50:23,410 --> 00:50:27,190
really is kind of a very focused

945
00:50:24,940 --> 00:50:28,720
performative<font color="#E5E5E5"> type of work so the only</font>

946
00:50:27,190 --> 00:50:31,210
way to really preserve it correctly

947
00:50:28,720 --> 00:50:33,129
would be to make it you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> playable on</font>

948
00:50:31,210 --> 00:50:35,800
some other platform that<font color="#E5E5E5"> exist beyond</font>

949
00:50:33,130 --> 00:50:38,560
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> PlayStation</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> which</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> would</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like that</font>

950
00:50:35,800 --> 00:50:40,750
for maybe one or two more questions<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

951
00:50:38,560 --> 00:50:42,190
think you've got to undermine<font color="#E5E5E5"> you when</font>

952
00:50:40,750 --> 00:50:43,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">you show the three pods</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in the beginning</font>

953
00:50:42,190 --> 00:50:47,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">of your presentation</font>

954
00:50:43,810 --> 00:50:48,820
you're saying those three pods<font color="#E5E5E5"> combined</font>

955
00:50:47,140 --> 00:50:50,529
to create what you<font color="#E5E5E5"> what we saw on the</font>

956
00:50:48,820 --> 00:50:52,839
screen afterwards and you were

957
00:50:50,530 --> 00:50:54,460
controlling it with a some kind of

958
00:50:52,839 --> 00:50:55,450
control or do you have to write code to

959
00:50:54,460 --> 00:50:59,560
do this away

960
00:50:55,450 --> 00:51:02,919
<font color="#E5E5E5">oh I'm right yes I there were three pods</font>

961
00:50:59,560 --> 00:51:05,320
that had that<font color="#CCCCCC"> M</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> behaved differently with</font>

962
00:51:02,920 --> 00:51:07,510
three different sets of particle objects

963
00:51:05,320 --> 00:51:09,940
I'm and I was showing<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of the</font>

964
00:51:07,510 --> 00:51:12,609
results<font color="#CCCCCC"> are playing each pod and i was</font>

965
00:51:09,940 --> 00:51:15,310
playing it with with this game

966
00:51:12,609 --> 00:51:18,160
controller and the controls of these

967
00:51:15,310 --> 00:51:22,119
buttons were actually mapped<font color="#E5E5E5"> to objects</font>

968
00:51:18,160 --> 00:51:25,029
in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> littlebigplanet level a building</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">toolkit which unfortunately we didn't</font>

970
00:51:25,030 --> 00:51:29,470
really get to show today<font color="#CCCCCC"> but if you look</font>

971
00:51:27,339 --> 00:51:32,650
online and you look up<font color="#CCCCCC"> littlebigplanet</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">micro chips and other behaviors that you</font>

975
00:51:38,710 --> 00:51:43,690
can you know program into these objects

00:51:42,069 --> 00:51:46,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">you can build with materials</font>

977
00:51:43,690 --> 00:51:47,770
does that make sense<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> yeah your last</font>

978
00:51:46,930 --> 00:51:49,690
question

shoot<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> kind of two but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe they</font>

00:51:49,690 --> 00:51:54,670
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> kinda short one of which is how</font>

981
00:51:51,250 --> 00:51:57,550
long did that take a good hard look

982
00:51:54,670 --> 00:52:00,430
slowly but<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> any other one is just</font>

983
00:51:57,550 --> 00:52:03,849
like what is your<font color="#CCCCCC"> favorite</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> weird little</font>

play with each of you we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

986
00:52:06,640 --> 00:52:10,328
<font color="#E5E5E5">really quickly that took</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't have</font>

987
00:52:08,560 --> 00:52:11,890
been working on that piece<font color="#CCCCCC"> I probably</font>

988
00:52:10,329 --> 00:52:14,349
worked on it for about<font color="#E5E5E5"> eight months that</font>

989
00:52:11,890 --> 00:52:16,509
particular thing i just showed<font color="#E5E5E5"> obviously</font>

990
00:52:14,349 --> 00:52:18,160
not consistently<font color="#CCCCCC"> I work for a living I</font>

991
00:52:16,510 --> 00:52:21,640
don't get paid for this work generally<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

992
00:52:18,160 --> 00:52:23,680
get to travel<font color="#CCCCCC"> and stuff but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> favorite</font>

993
00:52:21,640 --> 00:52:26,440

994
00:52:23,680 --> 00:52:26,759
that work which is really kind of you

995
00:52:26,440 --> 00:52:28,830
know

996
00:52:26,760 --> 00:52:30,450
<font color="#CCCCCC">ninety percent perspiration and the</font>

997
00:52:28,830 --> 00:52:32,279
<font color="#CCCCCC">photon loci work which is more about we</font>

998
00:52:30,450 --> 00:52:33,569
think about it and we can conceive<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

999
00:52:32,280 --> 00:52:35,610
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> we think might work in an</font>

1000
00:52:33,570 --> 00:52:36,960
interesting way<font color="#E5E5E5"> we allow it to break we</font>

1001
00:52:35,610 --> 00:52:39,480
allowed to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this other stuff it's</font>

1002
00:52:36,960 --> 00:52:42,000
still really hard work but there's a bit

1003
00:52:39,480 --> 00:52:44,160
more of a reward in a sense of<font color="#CCCCCC"> your</font>

1004
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:47,970
surprised<font color="#E5E5E5"> by it every time you play it</font>

1005
00:52:44,160 --> 00:52:50,160
yes you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i would say the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> tag</font>

1006
00:52:47,970 --> 00:52:52,770
sensors which<font color="#CCCCCC"> will transmit signals</font>

1007
00:52:50,160 --> 00:52:56,129
based on you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> player proximity or</font>

1008
00:52:52,770 --> 00:52:58,620
object proximity<font color="#CCCCCC"> tags and tagged sensors</font>

1009
00:52:56,130 --> 00:53:00,810
<font color="#CCCCCC">yes it's a programming we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do we the</font>

1010
00:52:58,620 --> 00:53:01,350
question was before we program any of

1011
00:53:00,810 --> 00:53:03,120
this

1012
00:53:01,350 --> 00:53:04,410
we kind of soft program<font color="#CCCCCC"> and I don't know</font>

1013
00:53:03,120 --> 00:53:07,109
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> the word would be but there's no</font>

1014
00:53:04,410 --> 00:53:08,460
actual number crunching<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm well</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

1015
00:53:07,110 --> 00:53:10,530
have to know<font color="#CCCCCC"> math</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit but it's</font>

1016
00:53:08,460 --> 00:53:12,000
basically<font color="#CCCCCC"> drag-and-drop ok but they they</font>

1017
00:53:10,530 --> 00:53:13,890
put in logic gates and things like that

1018
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:15,390
so you can really combine things<font color="#E5E5E5"> too if</font>

1019
00:53:13,890 --> 00:53:17,370
you get to know the quirks of the

1020
00:53:15,390 --> 00:53:19,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">behaviour of each of the objects you can</font>

1021
00:53:17,370 --> 00:53:21,270
get to build these really complex

1022
00:53:19,080 --> 00:53:23,670
machines to do things at the<font color="#CCCCCC"> game music</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">theory to actually a centrist</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> thing</font>
