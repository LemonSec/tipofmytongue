that everything about the drone campaign

218
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:18,990
is that in both of those cases the

219
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:21,120
courts ordered the release of

220
00:09:18,990 --> 00:09:23,520
information only after having concluded

221
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:25,620
that the government had officially

222
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:26,760
acknowledged the information we were

223
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:28,230
asking for

224
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:31,649
so in other words the courts didn't

225
00:09:28,230 --> 00:09:34,950
conclude<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> government</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> secrets</font>

226
00:09:31,649 --> 00:09:36,810

227
00:09:34,950 --> 00:09:38,760
concluded that the purported secrets

00:09:36,810 --> 00:09:43,619
<font color="#CCCCCC">word</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> secrets at all and that's a very</font>

229
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:45,689
different thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> right so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so to put it i</font>

230
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:48,120
guess a little more sharply both course

231
00:09:45,690 --> 00:09:51,480
both appeals courts in these ostensibly

232
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:53,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">very significant for victories were</font>

willing to rule for us only after

234
00:09:53,670 --> 00:09:58,199
concluding that we already had the

235
00:09:55,709 --> 00:10:00,089
information we were asking for<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I</font>

236
00:09:58,199 --> 00:10:01,680

kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of those kinds of transparency</font>

238
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:07,649
victories are reflective of the kinds of

239
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:10,199
victories that are possible to achieve

240
00:10:07,649 --> 00:10:12,570
in this in this context and and you know

241
00:10:10,199 --> 00:10:17,069
that sort of those are the height of

242
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:20,130
of that that's the extent of the

00:40:01,380 --> 00:40:05,040
we've just been talking about you know

985
00:40:02,580 --> 00:40:06,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">journalist actually want exclusive</font>

it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">but i also have also noted</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> notice that</font>

994
00:40:24,670 --> 00:40:30,759
so when we would get exclusive access to

995
00:40:28,420 --> 00:40:33,190
information<font color="#E5E5E5"> we would sometimes turn it</font>

00:40:30,759 --> 00:40:34,809
over to<font color="#CCCCCC"> a media organizations say that</font>

999
00:40:37,779 --> 00:40:39,819
you know we have this information we<font color="#CCCCCC"> go</font>

1000
00:40:39,039 --> 00:40:41,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">through</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for ya</font>

1001
00:40:39,819 --> 00:40:43,420
here's what we think it means but you

1002
00:40:41,410 --> 00:40:45,460
know you guys do your own investigation

1003
00:40:43,420 --> 00:40:47,619
and they would take time because they

1004
00:40:45,460 --> 00:40:51,519
had an exclusive<font color="#CCCCCC"> through us they would</font>

1005
00:40:47,619 --> 00:40:54,999
take time<font color="#E5E5E5"> to to do a deep story about</font>

1006
00:40:51,519 --> 00:40:56,979
that particular topic<font color="#E5E5E5"> if if you if</font>

1007
00:40:54,999 --> 00:40:59,919
everybody gets the information at once

1008
00:40:56,979 --> 00:41:01,689
nobody has the same incentive in taking

1009
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:03,999
the time they all the incentive is to

1010
00:41:01,690 --> 00:41:07,660
write something really quick to be the

1011
00:41:03,999 --> 00:41:09,640
first to write about it but the

1012
00:41:07,660 --> 00:41:11,950
incentives change in a way that you know

1013
00:41:09,640 --> 00:41:13,390
on balance<font color="#CCCCCC"> and it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hard to know you</font>

1014
00:41:11,950 --> 00:41:14,950
know how that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to affect the</font>

1015
00:41:13,390 --> 00:41:18,729
quality of the information that we

1016
00:41:14,950 --> 00:41:20,979
ultimately get<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so that that's not to</font>

1017
00:41:18,729 --> 00:41:24,129
say that you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're you're wrong</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

1018
00:41:20,979 --> 00:41:25,509
just think that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's it's hard</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hard</font>

1019
00:41:24,130 --> 00:41:27,190
to predict how<font color="#CCCCCC"> it plays out</font>

1020
00:41:25,509 --> 00:41:29,229
yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> i mean i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think that's useful that</font>

1021
00:41:27,190 --> 00:41:31,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">too</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> push against some of what I've</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">been</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> saying some you may</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have heard the</font>

distinction between transparency and<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

1024
00:41:33,039 --> 00:41:38,559
knowledge that some theorists<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

1025
00:41:36,519 --> 00:41:41,169
introduced and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i think that the argument</font>

1026
00:41:38,559 --> 00:41:43,719
for FOIA<font color="#CCCCCC"> least in part as it operates</font>

1027
00:41:41,170 --> 00:41:45,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">that would be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so great on</font>

1028
00:41:43,719 --> 00:41:48,849
transparency just production of

1029
00:41:45,940 --> 00:41:51,309
information in the public sphere<font color="#E5E5E5"> as we</font>

1030
00:41:48,849 --> 00:41:53,739
might think or want<font color="#E5E5E5"> but maybe it's not</font>

1031
00:41:51,309 --> 00:41:55,719
so bad for knowledge in that those

1032
00:41:53,739 --> 00:41:57,460
people get<font color="#CCCCCC"> stuck under</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> FOIA at least the</font>

1033
00:41:55,719 --> 00:42:00,009
<font color="#E5E5E5">journalists in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the in the civil society</font>

00:41:57,460 --> 00:42:02,469
<font color="#CCCCCC">requesters are are highly motivated to</font>

1035
00:42:00,009 --> 00:42:03,969
let you know what they found<font color="#E5E5E5"> in to you</font>

1036
00:42:02,469 --> 00:42:06,549
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> kinda maybe</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> even get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> credit for</font>

1037
00:42:03,969 --> 00:42:08,109
finding it and that conduces to public

1038
00:42:06,549 --> 00:42:09,849
knowledge at that is like actual

1039
00:42:08,109 --> 00:42:12,969
comprehension ability to act on

1040
00:42:09,849 --> 00:42:14,890
information not just the raw data itself

1041
00:42:12,969 --> 00:42:17,410
although again<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think that the the</font>

1042
00:42:14,890 --> 00:42:18,999
pathway from transparency knowledge can

1043
00:42:17,410 --> 00:42:19,359
because even without some of the way for

1044
00:42:18,999 --> 00:42:21,750
you

1045
00:42:19,359 --> 00:42:24,900
operates now

1046
00:42:21,750 --> 00:42:27,270

00:47:11,049 --> 00:47:16,329
fabulous<font color="#CCCCCC"> this question i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have might be</font>

1171
00:47:13,150 --> 00:47:20,950
out of scope<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so we can let go but it</font>

1172
00:47:16,329 --> 00:47:25,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">so Edward Snowden found delivered to the</font>

1173
00:47:20,950 --> 00:47:27,819
world a lot of documents and they were

1174
00:47:25,960 --> 00:47:30,160
delivered in such a way that I guess

1175
00:47:27,819 --> 00:47:32,230
even if he were dispatched<font color="#E5E5E5"> that they</font>

1176
00:47:30,160 --> 00:47:34,538
would still be released on some<font color="#CCCCCC"> time</font>

1177
00:47:32,230 --> 00:47:36,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">line there</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> would be encrypted and</font>

1178
00:47:34,539 --> 00:47:37,509
distributed and certain people<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">privileged to see them</font>

1180
00:47:37,509 --> 00:47:46,720
my question is how much of that document

1181
00:47:40,900 --> 00:47:48,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">stash</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have we seen</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and how much is left</font>

1182
00:47:46,720 --> 00:47:50,919
to be revealed<font color="#E5E5E5"> and insofar as you're</font>

1183
00:47:48,940 --> 00:47:52,150
able to talk about it for yourselves<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

1184
00:47:50,920 --> 00:47:55,509
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> degree have you been able to touch</font>

1185
00:47:52,150 --> 00:47:57,190
those documents yourselves<font color="#E5E5E5"> directly if</font>

you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> if this note i don't know an</font>

1189
00:48:01,329 --> 00:48:05,440
there's more to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> mind i know that some</font>

1190
00:48:03,220 --> 00:48:07,720
of the media<font color="#E5E5E5"> organizations have records</font>

1191
00:48:05,440 --> 00:48:10,119
that they haven't published or you know

1194
00:48:15,730 --> 00:48:21,910
go to learn more about that scope and

1195
00:48:20,470 --> 00:48:23,319
maybe maybe this is a question for

of conversations always amongst

it's the unhappiest place to work in the

federal government funding levels are

1219
00:49:17,820 --> 00:49:21,300
really pitiful compared to the scope of

the job they have to do<font color="#CCCCCC"> I don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

1262
00:51:08,140 --> 00:51:12,038
since I don't see any branch of
