cases like<font color="#CCCCCC"> Hillary Clinton and General</font>

talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> and when you compare that to what</font>

446
00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:44,390
happens to whistleblowers to act in

447

00:20:47,450 --> 00:20:51,200
about<font color="#CCCCCC"> prosecution's of whistleblowers</font>

450
00:20:49,490 --> 00:20:53,539
and in fact that that's kind of a tip of

451
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:55,610
a much larger iceberg<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> fact most of</font>

452
00:20:53,539 --> 00:20:57,530
the most of the censorship and

453
00:20:55,610 --> 00:20:59,389
repression is in secret because that's

454
00:20:57,530 --> 00:21:01,220
that's the most<font color="#CCCCCC"> Sarah piss</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and that's</font>

455
00:20:59,390 --> 00:21:02,690
the most effective type of repression

456
00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:05,539
so if we<font color="#CCCCCC"> look at</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Freedom of Information</font>

457
00:21:02,690 --> 00:21:07,820
kind of like a valve of information

458
00:21:05,539 --> 00:21:10,700
flowing you know from the government's

459
00:21:07,820 --> 00:21:13,220
perspective that that that flow can be

460
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:15,620
cut off at any point<font color="#E5E5E5"> so it could be cut</font>

461
00:21:13,220 --> 00:21:17,240
off at a drawn-out public trial of a

462
00:21:15,620 --> 00:21:20,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">whistleblower that could send a message</font>

463
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:21,919
but it can also be cut off by<font color="#E5E5E5"> draconian</font>

464
00:21:20,030 --> 00:21:23,350
administrative policies and threatening

<font color="#CCCCCC">and FBI visits</font>

466
00:21:23,350 --> 00:21:28,449
<font color="#E5E5E5">that are much more difficult to report</font>

467
00:21:25,780 --> 00:21:30,309
it can be cut off at the publisher level

468
00:21:28,450 --> 00:21:31,750
so the whistleblower<font color="#E5E5E5"> can disclose all</font>

469
00:21:30,309 --> 00:21:33,789
the materials you can have all the

470
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:35,620
technical protections and anonymity of

471
00:21:33,789 --> 00:21:37,990
whistleblowers<font color="#CCCCCC"> but the publisher can</font>

472
00:21:35,620 --> 00:21:39,459
simply be afraid to publish<font color="#E5E5E5"> because</font>

473
00:21:37,990 --> 00:21:41,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">they're afraid of losing access or</font>

474
00:21:39,460 --> 00:21:43,270
they're afraid of a criminal prosecution

475
00:21:41,410 --> 00:21:44,860
so we saw that actually with the<font color="#CCCCCC"> New</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">York Times</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and waiting a year with the</font>

478
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:51,428
that today when you look at how the

479
00:21:49,390 --> 00:21:54,039
mainstream media behaves<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot of the</font>

480
00:21:51,429 --> 00:21:57,400

of losing access to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> kings or now</font>

the official policy was neutrality but

that they wanted to go after the source

00:22:50,230 --> 00:22:54,460
of the story the story actually ended up

505
