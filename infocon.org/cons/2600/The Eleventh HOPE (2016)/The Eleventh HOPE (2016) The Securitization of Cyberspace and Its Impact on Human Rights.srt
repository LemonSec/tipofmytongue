00:06:16,350 --> 00:06:19,140
that we're doing so it's an example of

the kind of stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you can see this</font>

158
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:12,060
like presumably we want infrastructure

00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:12,750
to be safe because at the end of the

165
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:31,080
and so we're really raising these these

00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:33,360
questions in all sorts of places<font color="#CCCCCC"> we've</font>

along the way and in particularly<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're</font>

the end<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're CEO</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> or or your</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> finance</font>

271
00:12:08,570 --> 00:12:11,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">department is still going to use</font>

274
00:12:13,940 --> 00:12:19,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">governments want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to have and so that</font>

275
00:12:17,270 --> 00:12:23,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">back doors can also be used by other so</font>

276
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:25,850
what we basically want to achieve is

277
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:30,110
shifting the debate from what is a cyber

278
00:12:25,850 --> 00:12:32,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">defense</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> debate so what are our technical</font>

279
00:12:30,110 --> 00:12:35,960
capacities to like attack other people

280
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:38,390
or to attack individuals to a cyber

281
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:39,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">defense debate how can we make sure that</font>

282
00:12:38,390 --> 00:12:42,830
all the<font color="#CCCCCC"> end users</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that all the citizens</font>

283
00:12:39,980 --> 00:12:45,050
are protected against all this potential

284
00:12:42,830 --> 00:12:48,260
threats and that's by actually trying to

285
00:12:45,050 --> 00:12:49,969
enforce and push forward<font color="#E5E5E5"> a new</font>

286
00:12:48,260 --> 00:12:56,180
encryption techniques and more secure

287
00:12:49,970 --> 00:12:59,030
computing so i think it was in our last

288
00:12:56,180 --> 00:13:00,650
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> need</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a round of discussions about</font>

289
00:12:59,030 --> 00:13:03,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">this subject</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with other groups like</font>

290
00:13:00,650 --> 00:13:07,760
policy and and technology groups and in

291
00:13:03,980 --> 00:13:10,970
one of those groups<font color="#CCCCCC"> I i remember</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Bruce</font>

292
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:15,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">and I are being around and he perfectly</font>

293
00:13:10,970 --> 00:13:18,200
i think<font color="#CCCCCC"> summarize what we are trying to</font>

294
00:13:15,770 --> 00:13:22,579
do but saying it's actually so<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's not</font>

295
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:23,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">security forces like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> human rights were</font>

296
00:13:22,580 --> 00:13:25,760
like freedom

297
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:30,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's basically all security</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's the</font>

298
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:32,990
security<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> end-user</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> vs and and and</font>

299
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:35,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">and other levels of security so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and as</font>

300
00:13:32,990 --> 00:13:38,930
he phrased it<font color="#CCCCCC"> he said if i remember</font>

301
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:43,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">correctly</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's all about security stupid</font>

302
00:13:38,930 --> 00:13:46,640
so with that I will hand over to<font color="#E5E5E5"> Camille</font>

303
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:50,300
<font color="#CCCCCC">who will get back i think a bit more</font>

304
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:51,980
into the whole cyber narrative<font color="#CCCCCC"> no don't</font>

305
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:54,260
do this to me<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's not nice</font>

306
00:13:51,980 --> 00:13:56,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">ok so we were we I think we're trying to</font>

307
00:13:54,260 --> 00:13:58,610
have a workshop<font color="#E5E5E5"> econ versation</font>

308
00:13:56,870 --> 00:14:00,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">no like more participative debate which</font>

309
00:13:58,610 --> 00:14:02,240
is hard because of the configuration of

310
00:14:00,260 --> 00:14:03,230
the room<font color="#CCCCCC"> and because i can't see any of</font>

311
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:07,790
you

312
00:14:03,230 --> 00:14:09,710
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> to to do what you're asking me to do</font>

313
00:14:07,790 --> 00:14:13,010
<font color="#CCCCCC">socialite through the fun part about the</font>

314
00:14:09,710 --> 00:14:14,180
cyber debate is<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's basically two</font>

315
00:14:13,010 --> 00:14:16,339
approaches<font color="#E5E5E5"> right</font>

316
00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:17,989
the usual one that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're used to is the</font>

317
00:14:16,339 --> 00:14:20,150
only way we use cyber it's like the

318
00:14:17,990 --> 00:14:23,180
cyber libertarian approach is this idea

319
00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:26,720
that is very John Perry Barlow idea that

320
00:14:23,180 --> 00:14:29,329
in cyberspace<font color="#CCCCCC"> internet 70 doesn't apply</font>

321
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:31,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">like the government can try to catch up</font>

322
00:14:29,330 --> 00:14:33,500
with what people are doing in cyberspace

323
00:14:31,070 --> 00:14:35,390
but this is really a space of freedom

324
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:37,640
it's a space in which people are allowed

325
00:14:35,390 --> 00:14:39,920
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> tinker it's a space in which people</font>

326
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:42,170
will create an attempt new things and

327
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:43,849
that's like one paradigm<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we were</font>

328
00:14:42,170 --> 00:14:45,079
kind of like living in this bubble word

329
00:14:43,850 --> 00:14:47,480
and it was<font color="#CCCCCC"> kind of cool and everything</font>

330
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:49,010
and then we go sort of<font color="#E5E5E5"> realize that not</font>

331
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:51,200
everyone<font color="#CCCCCC"> was thinking about it like this</font>

332
00:14:49,010 --> 00:14:53,150
and it became apparent and very clear

333
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:55,279
that there was another paradigm which

334
00:14:53,150 --> 00:14:56,390
was the exact opposite which is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

335
00:14:55,279 --> 00:14:58,610
know what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> call the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> cyber warfare</font>

336
00:14:56,390 --> 00:15:01,400
paradigm which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> well actually the</font>

337
00:14:58,610 --> 00:15:04,040
entire domain of cyberspace is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> fifth</font>

341
00:15:09,529 --> 00:15:13,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">stage just like okay well those two are</font>

342
00:15:11,150 --> 00:15:15,949
obviously not compatible<font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> obviously</font>

343
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:18,620
think that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you you do this well we think</font>

344
00:15:15,950 --> 00:15:20,839
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we have a problem right and so</font>

345
00:15:18,620 --> 00:15:22,459
at this stage of people say well you

346
00:15:20,839 --> 00:15:24,589
know there must be some in between which

347
00:15:22,459 --> 00:15:26,900
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> discuss what the appropriate rules of</font>

348
00:15:24,589 --> 00:15:29,630
engagement for governments in cyberspace

349
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:31,699
<font color="#E5E5E5">and what's kind of you know that the</font>

350
00:15:29,630 --> 00:15:33,589
area in which we believe that they can

351
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:35,660
be security they can be military

352
00:15:33,589 --> 00:15:37,970
intervention<font color="#E5E5E5"> is needed but in a way that</font>

353
00:15:35,660 --> 00:15:40,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">doesn't trampled</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> human rights and our</font>

00:16:52,060 --> 00:16:55,810
you drop one you get the other<font color="#E5E5E5"> up it's</font>

you don't have cyber security in this

world because you know if you don't have

a secure connection you use<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> right to</font>

00:17:13,689 --> 00:17:18,610
table this idea that there is<font color="#E5E5E5"> security</font>

402
00:17:16,420 --> 00:17:20,319
<font color="#E5E5E5">versus privacy tension</font>

403
00:17:18,609 --> 00:17:22,359
<font color="#E5E5E5">why don't we just admit that this is a</font>

404
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:24,099
continuum and want to build on that and

405
00:17:22,359 --> 00:17:26,020
then the rethinking of the definition

406
00:17:24,099 --> 00:17:28,240
was kind of fun because ultimately the

407
00:17:26,020 --> 00:17:30,100
people that these recommendations go<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

408
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:31,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">or people who</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sit in government and</font>

409
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:34,330
their question is like<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm in</font>

does<font color="#E5E5E5"> impact my business like what what</font>

417
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:52,450
are the questions that you guys want me

418
00:17:50,770 --> 00:17:55,330
to run<font color="#E5E5E5"> through and so we became</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

419
00:17:52,450 --> 00:17:57,130
question about<font color="#E5E5E5"> norms right like it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> what</font>

420
00:17:55,330 --> 00:17:59,830
is it<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we want to put on their desk</font>

421
00:17:57,130 --> 00:18:02,350
as like we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to build in these</font>

422
00:17:59,830 --> 00:18:04,030
reflexes that everything you do has an

423
00:18:02,350 --> 00:18:07,389
impact on human rights and this is where

424
00:18:04,030 --> 00:18:09,580
we want you to start and so same thing I

425
00:18:07,390 --> 00:18:12,010
think we think here like today in this

426
00:18:09,580 --> 00:18:14,230
room in 2016 like yeah this is very

427
00:18:12,010 --> 00:18:15,879
obvious<font color="#E5E5E5"> there wasn't and it supposes</font>

428
00:18:14,230 --> 00:18:19,309
that took forever right<font color="#CCCCCC"> when you think</font>

429
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:22,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">about when people started working on</font>

00:18:19,309 --> 00:18:25,129
<font color="#CCCCCC">Nick</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you know the beginning for instance</font>

437
00:18:34,610 --> 00:18:39,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">I mean iid</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> cyberwarfare so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm a bit</font>

438
00:18:36,049 --> 00:18:42,019
heavy on<font color="#CCCCCC"> notnot</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> as in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i conduct but this</font>

439
00:18:39,620 --> 00:18:43,639
is an area of interest for me so I'm a

440
00:18:42,019 --> 00:18:45,019
little bit heavy on the military side of

441
00:18:43,639 --> 00:18:46,549
things but you know when you think about

442
00:18:45,019 --> 00:18:48,110
everything that has happened<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

447
00:18:58,759 --> 00:19:03,799
<font color="#E5E5E5">apply to cyberspace</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like 2013 right so</font>

448
00:19:02,269 --> 00:19:05,330
we're building on that and even when we

449
00:19:03,799 --> 00:19:07,340
started doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> this people say</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay human</font>

00:19:05,330 --> 00:19:11,240

451
00:19:07,340 --> 00:19:12,649
<font color="#CCCCCC">huh ok.how</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and the ok how is kind of the</font>

452
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:14,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">question that we wanted to discuss an</font>

00:19:12,649 --> 00:19:17,119
impact<font color="#CCCCCC"> what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are the points that we need</font>

454
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:21,889
to hit<font color="#CCCCCC"> know what we're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> where should we</font>

455
00:19:17,119 --> 00:19:24,110
focus at what do we want to make a norm

456
00:19:21,889 --> 00:19:25,879
as in what are the things that we want

457
00:19:24,110 --> 00:19:28,729
to ensure that everyone who operates in

458
00:19:25,879 --> 00:19:32,029
that space<font color="#E5E5E5"> prioritizes and think about</font>

459
00:19:28,730 --> 00:19:33,379
<font color="#E5E5E5">now</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't know how we make a debate in</font>

460
00:19:32,029 --> 00:19:38,779
that room but<font color="#CCCCCC"> social you're good at this</font>

461
00:19:33,379 --> 00:19:41,360
so back to you and<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah yeah</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so if we</font>

462
00:19:38,779 --> 00:19:43,279
can get the lights up maybe we can use

463
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:44,779
the rest of the time to actually talk

464
00:19:43,279 --> 00:19:47,779
about what other people want to know

465
00:19:44,779 --> 00:19:50,450
about and have questions about and some

466
00:19:47,779 --> 00:19:51,769
things that could help<font color="#E5E5E5"> we can we can</font>

467
00:19:50,450 --> 00:19:53,749
start with a couple questions like you

468
00:19:51,769 --> 00:19:55,879
can tell<font color="#CCCCCC"> us just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> why you came why you</font>

469
00:19:53,749 --> 00:19:58,009
thought it was interesting because you

470
00:19:55,879 --> 00:20:00,799
<font color="#E5E5E5">have the wrong room</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in here the schedule</font>

471
00:19:58,009 --> 00:20:04,429
<font color="#CCCCCC">is right that you could</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> say that you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can</font>

472
00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:06,350
also maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about like outputs from</font>

473
00:20:04,429 --> 00:20:08,990
a working<font color="#E5E5E5"> group such as ours that you</font>

474
00:20:06,350 --> 00:20:10,490
would find to be useful in the world and

475
00:20:08,990 --> 00:20:12,019
your perspective on that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think that we</font>

476
00:20:10,490 --> 00:20:13,850
would maybe get a lot out of<font color="#CCCCCC"> them and</font>

477
00:20:12,019 --> 00:20:15,919
we'll take it back to our working group

478
00:20:13,850 --> 00:20:19,129
<font color="#E5E5E5">so I thought</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I hand in the back and then</font>

479
00:20:15,919 --> 00:20:49,680
a hand here is<font color="#CCCCCC"> their</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> microphone for the</font>

480
00:20:19,129 --> 00:20:56,750
audience

481
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:58,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">all right</font>

482
00:20:56,750 --> 00:21:01,100
absolutely so the question was can we

483
00:20:58,460 --> 00:21:02,720
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> we just frame the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> internet as a</font>

484
00:21:01,100 --> 00:21:04,639
conduit for<font color="#E5E5E5"> human rights and why are we</font>

485
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:05,960
trying to<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that is actually what</font>

486
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:08,270
we're doing so we're not trying to say

487
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:09,920
that the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet is a human right we're</font>

488
00:21:08,270 --> 00:21:12,080
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and I think it goes beyond</font>

489
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:14,240
that because<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think as</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is community</font>

490
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:18,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">saying it's understood now in this sort</font>

491
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:21,200
of policy world that human rights apply

492
00:21:18,740 --> 00:21:23,180
online as a sort of space<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're still</font>

493
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:25,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">because the you know there's a lot of</font>

494
00:21:23,180 --> 00:21:30,350
sectors involved and they're still not

495
00:21:25,310 --> 00:21:32,899
sort of wide recognition or that that

496
00:21:30,350 --> 00:21:35,030
that there is really not a whole lot of

497
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:37,010
separation between the<font color="#E5E5E5"> internet</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> our</font>

498
00:21:35,030 --> 00:21:38,899
real lives like that sort of eroding but

499
00:21:37,010 --> 00:21:40,370
anyway so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think that more than what</font>

500
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:42,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">we're fighting</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we're fighting</font>

501
00:21:40,370 --> 00:21:44,959
against is this notion<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's actually you</font>

502
00:21:42,860 --> 00:21:46,340
can see it outside of outside of the

503
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:48,290
internet for a second so the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Patriot Act</font>

504
00:21:46,340 --> 00:21:50,959
it's like we're inundated with this

505
00:21:48,290 --> 00:21:52,490
notion that if we all want to be secure

506
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:54,440
we need to give up our rights from<font color="#E5E5E5"> time</font>

507
00:21:52,490 --> 00:21:56,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">to time it's mostly about the right to</font>

508
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:57,890
privacy<font color="#E5E5E5"> so like we should be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ok with</font>

509
00:21:56,360 --> 00:22:00,949
surveillance because it helps catch

510
00:21:57,890 --> 00:22:02,720
people who would make us insecure<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

511
00:22:00,950 --> 00:22:06,050
we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> fighting</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that on in this sort of</font>

512
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:08,150
<font color="#CCCCCC">Internet context</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so we we see this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

513
00:22:06,050 --> 00:22:10,250
see this a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so we're going since</font>

514
00:22:08,150 --> 00:22:11,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">so so we're going to policymakers and</font>

515
00:22:10,250 --> 00:22:14,540
we're saying you know if you want your

516
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:16,880
cyber security policy to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> rights</font>

517
00:22:14,540 --> 00:22:18,530
respecting you can't just as the EU just

518
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:21,050
did what two weeks ago<font color="#E5E5E5"> replace it</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">releases</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> cybersecurity strategy has like</font>

520
00:22:21,050 --> 00:22:27,350
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 16 points about</font>

521
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:28,940
mostly<font color="#E5E5E5"> markets and then the last point</font>

522
00:22:27,350 --> 00:22:31,040
which<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think they might put on every</font>

523
00:22:28,940 --> 00:22:32,660
single thing they do which is about this

524
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:34,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">everything that we do in this context</font>

00:22:32,660 --> 00:22:36,890
needs to respect human rights<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they</font>

giving it like deep thought<font color="#CCCCCC"> right</font>

529
00:22:40,790 --> 00:22:44,210
without thinking that<font color="#E5E5E5"> oh maybe the</font>

530
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:45,740
reason why we want to have a secure

531
00:22:44,210 --> 00:22:47,390
internet is so that people can enjoy

their human rights<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to</font>

00:30:14,510 --> 00:30:19,400
to is like people who don't speak

his action<font color="#E5E5E5"> break protocols</font>

705
00:30:22,250 --> 00:30:26,060
what is it that we get in front of them

00:30:23,570 --> 00:30:26,810
and they they are the audience for that

707

work

708
00:30:26,810 --> 00:30:31,340
alright so the norms they don't go to

709
00:30:28,850 --> 00:30:32,959
people who do fantastic technical work

710

because a<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they're already</font>

712
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:38,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">that they are the first line of defense</font>

713
00:30:36,860 --> 00:30:40,850
and they don't need to be lectured about

714
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:43,100
human rights<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's more like the rest you</font>

to look at it from<font color="#CCCCCC"> there</font>

732

we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going both ways we're trying to as</font>

showing showing up to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> ITF and</font>

00:31:33,870 --> 00:31:37,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">talking about human rights and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

741
00:31:35,220 --> 00:31:39,540
getting<font color="#CCCCCC"> technologist to see that sort of</font>

742
00:31:37,620 --> 00:31:40,679
the open standards<font color="#E5E5E5"> and and the things</font>

743
00:31:39,540 --> 00:31:42,570
that people are committed to an

744
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:45,090
altruistic way actually have a great

745
00:31:42,570 --> 00:31:47,340
deal of overlap with<font color="#E5E5E5"> human rights the</font>

746
00:31:45,090 --> 00:31:48,990
way it's phrased and the universal

748
00:31:48,990 --> 00:31:53,280
rights<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so and then the other way</font>

749
00:31:52,050 --> 00:31:55,320
right and and so we want more

751
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:59,129
<font color="#E5E5E5">so we're trying to build that bridge and</font>

752
00:31:56,940 --> 00:32:00,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">its really really important i think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

757
00:32:07,110 --> 00:32:11,370
out now I mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> metadata for example is</font>

758
00:32:09,510 --> 00:32:13,080
like a really hard problem from a

759
00:32:11,370 --> 00:32:16,350
technical perspective and if you don't

760
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:18,000
solve it<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have a leak in privacy</font>

761
00:32:16,350 --> 00:32:19,980
right and that's like you know that's

762
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:22,230
not a policy issue<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's that's a</font>

push towards using all<font color="#E5E5E5"> secure protocols</font>

807
00:34:11,889 --> 00:34:16,659
lot of other old standards that have

808
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:18,970
some great additions that sometimes have

809
00:34:16,659 --> 00:34:24,489
already been put<font color="#E5E5E5"> to publish and should</font>

be implemented and sometimes<font color="#CCCCCC"> there are</font>

811
00:34:24,489 --> 00:34:30,009
their policies and our dare even

812
00:34:26,830 --> 00:34:32,319
standards that still need to be pushed

813
00:34:30,010 --> 00:34:37,720
or standardized in this part of the

814
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:41,620
process I think it comes to policy<font color="#E5E5E5"> if</font>

815
00:34:37,719 --> 00:34:46,029
you want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you want to protect</font>

816
00:34:41,620 --> 00:34:48,040
citizens then the basic point to start

817
00:34:46,030 --> 00:34:50,440
is protecting citizens are not

818
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:52,870
necessarily<font color="#CCCCCC"> protect a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> protecting the</font>

00:34:52,870 --> 00:34:58,990
place to to protect the citizens

821
00:34:56,830 --> 00:35:02,230
citizens<font color="#CCCCCC"> cuz what is happening in a lot</font>

822
00:34:58,990 --> 00:35:04,390
of times is that<font color="#CCCCCC"> dose the protection of</font>

823
00:35:02,230 --> 00:35:06,700
those institutions<font color="#E5E5E5"> becomes more</font>

824
00:35:04,390 --> 00:35:08,319
important than the protection of the

825
00:35:06,700 --> 00:35:11,680
citizens and I think the whole narrative

826
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:14,230
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> national security exceptions is</font>

827
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:17,470
the is the kind of thing that that

828
00:35:14,230 --> 00:35:20,080
epitomizes that narrative and I think

829
00:35:17,470 --> 00:35:20,770
that narrative is in essence completely

830
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:23,650
wrong

831
00:35:20,770 --> 00:35:27,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think every law should be able to cope</font>

832
00:35:23,650 --> 00:35:30,070
with any kind of a thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's tries to</font>

833
00:35:27,790 --> 00:35:33,580
defend and<font color="#CCCCCC"> it shouldn't be a kind of</font>

like specific exception that you can

invoke<font color="#E5E5E5"> almost every time because we're</font>

836
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:41,200
not talking about something that happens

837
00:35:39,010 --> 00:35:43,210

the time and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then you can say yeah but</font>

842
00:35:49,270 --> 00:35:53,890
the world has changed

843
00:35:50,500 --> 00:35:56,859
yeah well we've seen like<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean we saw</font>

844
00:35:53,890 --> 00:35:58,690
a lot more deaths<font color="#CCCCCC"> even by terrorism in</font>

845
00:35:56,859 --> 00:36:00,520
the eighties<font color="#CCCCCC"> then we're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> seeing right now</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not saying that the world is a</font>

fun place and that we should not that

848
00:36:02,890 --> 00:36:09,279
that we should build our systems<font color="#CCCCCC"> 222</font>

00:36:07,119 --> 00:36:13,240
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> eight everyone in doing everything</font>

850
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:19,359
but<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> also as as citizens we</font>

851
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:22,899
should allow<font color="#CCCCCC"> for 444</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> let's say security</font>

852
00:36:19,359 --> 00:36:26,410
forces if they want to actually find

853
00:36:22,900 --> 00:36:28,300
actual criminals<font color="#CCCCCC"> are not civilians to</font>

854
00:36:26,410 --> 00:36:30,759
have proper methods to do that in the

855
00:36:28,300 --> 00:36:32,320
actual world and that's probably it's

856
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:34,240
going to be more expensive it's probably

857
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:37,869
also going to work better

858
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:40,450
all of the last<font color="#E5E5E5"> like few attempts and</font>

like hey can we get something concrete<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

877
00:37:39,710 --> 00:37:43,670
agree with that<font color="#CCCCCC"> like our recommendations</font>

are super vague<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know why because</font>

879
00:37:43,670 --> 00:37:48,050
they have to go through an<font color="#E5E5E5"> interagency</font>

approval process and<font color="#CCCCCC"> there's signed and</font>

00:38:00,230 --> 00:38:04,849
and NGO people can't produce great super

00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:06,890
specific recommendations<font color="#CCCCCC"> I can cite you</font>

are<font color="#CCCCCC"> fantastic work done by NGOs to</font>

892
00:38:11,510 --> 00:38:16,490
actually get more clarity and be very

893
00:38:13,910 --> 00:38:18,980
specific on how the overlap<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know</font>

between<font color="#E5E5E5"> surveillance and you know</font>

the room and say<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> now let's work on</font>

898
00:38:24,740 --> 00:38:28,339
this together and at the end of the day

899
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:29,630
you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> gonna have to do something and</font>

900
00:38:28,339 --> 00:38:30,770
you you know you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> gonna have to look</font>

901
00:38:29,630 --> 00:38:32,569
at it you put it through the interagency

902
00:38:30,770 --> 00:38:34,250
agreement process but then you sign it

903
00:38:32,569 --> 00:38:35,869
and then you live up to it<font color="#CCCCCC"> then</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this is</font>

904
00:38:34,250 --> 00:38:37,700
kind of where the conversation gets more

905
00:38:35,869 --> 00:38:39,800
complicated<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we can talk a little bit</font>

00:38:49,220 --> 00:38:53,029
<font color="#E5E5E5">but it's complicated because governments</font>

have<font color="#CCCCCC"> their</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in multiple people involved</font>

915
00:38:55,010 --> 00:38:58,670
way to say well you know like we totally

916
00:38:57,290 --> 00:39:00,740
agree with that<font color="#E5E5E5"> but then those people</font>

917
00:38:58,670 --> 00:39:02,480
who are on the you know state of

918
00:39:00,740 --> 00:39:04,578
emergency side of things they have a

919
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:06,050
completely different discussion<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you</font>

920
00:39:04,579 --> 00:39:08,089
know this is in their backyard so when

921
00:39:06,050 --> 00:39:10,040
you say like<font color="#CCCCCC"> yeah why can't we be more</font>

922
00:39:08,089 --> 00:39:12,078
concrete is because when you say<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

923
00:39:10,040 --> 00:39:14,329
let's talk about for instance the

924
00:39:12,079 --> 00:39:15,980
vulnerability equities process and how

925
00:39:14,329 --> 00:39:19,099
it pertains to human rights people say

926
00:39:15,980 --> 00:39:20,839
mmm can't<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> or don't have</font>

927
00:39:19,099 --> 00:39:22,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">the mandate</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> or this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one go through the</font>

931
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:35,680
because you know like<font color="#CCCCCC"> legs bridge the</font>

932
00:39:32,540 --> 00:39:38,890
gap between what rate fantastic<font color="#CCCCCC"> activity</font>

936
00:39:42,369 --> 00:39:47,260
can do when they sit and agreed together

937
00:39:44,230 --> 00:39:48,819
and what becomes an actual norm that

938
00:39:47,260 --> 00:39:51,040
they're willing to endorse and follow

939
00:39:48,819 --> 00:39:53,170
<font color="#CCCCCC">now if anyone can help us like eliminate</font>

940
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:54,759
what happens in that gap<font color="#E5E5E5"> and how do we</font>

941
00:39:53,170 --> 00:39:56,950
manage to have<font color="#E5E5E5"> like you know great</font>

943
00:39:56,950 --> 00:40:01,419
nothing but vague norms and then we're

944
00:39:59,890 --> 00:40:02,980
left saying like yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> we would we do</font>

945
00:40:01,420 --> 00:40:06,160
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> shift the paradigms and you know</font>

those

00:40:40,690 --> 00:40:51,640
so what's the impact<font color="#CCCCCC"> of so I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

00:40:51,640 --> 00:40:56,890
absolutely<font color="#E5E5E5"> i mean just all speak more</font>

956
00:40:53,620 --> 00:41:00,580
generally about this issue of signing

957
00:40:56,890 --> 00:41:02,529
things and then follow up so that is

958
00:41:00,580 --> 00:41:04,420
absolutely a consideration what if they

959
00:41:02,530 --> 00:41:06,280
don't sign<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm actually gonna</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about</font>

960
00:41:04,420 --> 00:41:09,130
what if they do sign and then what

961
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:10,870
because this is a very<font color="#E5E5E5"> this this happens</font>

um there was something<font color="#E5E5E5"> a really great</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">there's been no follow-up there's been</font>

00:42:00,580 --> 00:42:06,250
no revocation of membership because of

986
00:42:03,730 --> 00:42:07,930
like shady practices<font color="#CCCCCC"> I mean Tunisia's on</font>

00:42:06,250 --> 00:42:11,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">there like all kinds of things right so</font>

00:42:07,930 --> 00:42:12,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">so no real accountability</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm we're so</font>

989
00:42:11,050 --> 00:42:14,650
far back in our working group that we

990
00:42:12,730 --> 00:42:17,260
can't even get our recommendations to be

991
00:42:14,650 --> 00:42:18,640
to be signed by the<font color="#E5E5E5"> 23-member</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> States</font>

992
00:42:17,260 --> 00:42:21,010
we're still just sort of like as a

993
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:23,589
working group which<font color="#CCCCCC"> to our credit has</font>

994
00:42:21,010 --> 00:42:25,930
been a collaboration with<font color="#CCCCCC"> canada and the</font>

US<font color="#CCCCCC"> we have also the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Netherlands who are</font>

996
00:42:25,930 --> 00:42:30,399
like shining stars comparatively and

00:42:28,780 --> 00:42:32,800
have really<font color="#E5E5E5"> grease the wheels</font>

998

oh my<font color="#E5E5E5"> god you know some of the other</font>

999
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:35,740
working groups have like<font color="#E5E5E5"> Britain which I</font>

1000
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:37,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">here on another working group is even</font>

1001
00:42:35,740 --> 00:42:39,279
worse than working with us<font color="#CCCCCC"> i mean</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they</font>

1002
00:42:37,270 --> 00:42:40,690
really<font color="#CCCCCC"> Stonewall some things like about</font>

1003
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:43,150
trying to get served like we couldn't

1004
00:42:40,690 --> 00:42:45,490
mention surveillance how<font color="#E5E5E5"> the how do you</font>

1005
00:42:43,150 --> 00:42:46,600
have the cybersecurity focus on human

1006
00:42:45,490 --> 00:42:48,160
rights and you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can say the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> word</font>

1007
00:42:46,600 --> 00:42:49,450
surveillance that actually made one of

1008
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:51,279
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> cofounders of the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> working group</font>

1009
00:42:49,450 --> 00:42:53,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">believed</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that was a controversy about</font>

1010
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:55,660
that around the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Mongolian meeting</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font>

1011
00:42:53,740 --> 00:42:58,689
anyway so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I mean just just to your</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> point</font>

1012
00:42:55,660 --> 00:43:00,129
<font color="#E5E5E5">like I think sometimes we we are really</font>

1013
00:42:58,690 --> 00:43:02,110
focused on these sort of things<font color="#E5E5E5"> where</font>

1014
00:43:00,130 --> 00:43:04,120
people sign on and they<font color="#CCCCCC"> they accept and</font>

1015
00:43:02,110 --> 00:43:05,210
so on but i found just generally in the

1016
00:43:04,120 --> 00:43:06,470
policy world that

1017
00:43:05,210 --> 00:43:09,620
and then like there's just so little

1018
00:43:06,470 --> 00:43:11,600
accountability and<font color="#CCCCCC"> follow-up that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that's</font>

1019
00:43:09,620 --> 00:43:13,609
I think why we're like<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're desperate</font>

1020
00:43:11,600 --> 00:43:14,630
for some more concrete goals we can get

1021
00:43:13,610 --> 00:43:16,430
out besides these sort of

1022
00:43:14,630 --> 00:43:18,500
recommendations that that people sign

1023
00:43:16,430 --> 00:43:21,169
<font color="#E5E5E5">onto but then don't actually follow up</font>

1024
00:43:18,500 --> 00:43:22,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">with so like ranking digital rights is a</font>

1025
00:43:21,170 --> 00:43:25,400
really good initiative that tries to

1026
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:27,050
score people you've also seen the eff

1027
00:43:25,400 --> 00:43:28,280
like they score people for various

1028
00:43:27,050 --> 00:43:29,990
things<font color="#CCCCCC"> I mean like that kind of stuff</font>

1029
00:43:28,280 --> 00:43:31,880
seems to be a bit more effective because

1030
00:43:29,990 --> 00:43:35,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">you're actually getting the output not</font>

1031
00:43:31,880 --> 00:43:37,130
just like the<font color="#E5E5E5"> promise right so if people</font>

1032
00:43:35,450 --> 00:43:38,779
want to take our norms and then<font color="#CCCCCC"> create a</font>

1033
00:43:37,130 --> 00:43:41,480
scoring card and then run the country

1034
00:43:38,780 --> 00:43:43,790
through this<font color="#CCCCCC"> was a great idea i just</font>

1035
00:43:41,480 --> 00:43:45,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">wanted</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you know it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> want to</font>

1036
00:43:43,790 --> 00:43:49,160
highlight though that you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> to to</font>

1037
00:43:45,770 --> 00:43:51,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">canada</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and the US</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> has credit</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they showed</font>

up like<font color="#E5E5E5"> there</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are a lot of countries who</font>

some<font color="#E5E5E5"> more questions</font>

think from my standpoint as a

1063
00:45:30,640 --> 00:45:37,420
technologist<font color="#E5E5E5"> is what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i try to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> achieve at</font>

1064
00:45:34,360 --> 00:45:41,950
least is that if we now develop<font color="#E5E5E5"> sound</font>

1065
00:45:37,420 --> 00:45:44,770
encryption for<font color="#E5E5E5"> end users or 448 either</font>

1066
00:45:41,950 --> 00:45:46,990
date<font color="#CCCCCC"> I arrests or data in transit that</font>

1067
00:45:44,770 --> 00:45:49,180
those are not going to be forbidden in

1068
00:45:46,990 --> 00:45:54,640
five years<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to me would already be</font>

1069
00:45:49,180 --> 00:45:57,490
like a major<font color="#CCCCCC"> a thing to achieve i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

1070
00:45:54,640 --> 00:45:59,049
we're at<font color="#CCCCCC"> that point where we can't just</font>

1071
00:45:57,490 --> 00:46:01,450
and that's what I was trying to say i

1072
00:45:59,050 --> 00:46:03,640
don't think that policy is going to save

1073
00:46:01,450 --> 00:46:05,529
the world but it's also not<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm sorry</font>

1074
00:46:03,640 --> 00:46:07,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">for your</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> silicon valley folks it's also</font>

1075
00:46:05,530 --> 00:46:10,030
not technology that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to save the</font>

1076
00:46:07,180 --> 00:46:11,560
world<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it's also not law or anything</font>

1077
00:46:10,030 --> 00:46:15,910
else

1078
00:46:11,560 --> 00:46:18,970
so if we want to like keep the world a

1079
00:46:15,910 --> 00:46:21,940
bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> sane and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> or</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> improve on it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> then we</font>

1080
00:46:18,970 --> 00:46:24,009
should work in all the fields and<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

1081
00:46:21,940 --> 00:46:26,230
think what we're trying to do here<font color="#CCCCCC"> is at</font>

1082
00:46:24,010 --> 00:46:28,360
least<font color="#E5E5E5"> make sure that things</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I mean</font>

1083
00:46:26,230 --> 00:46:31,030
things are always shifting in one way

1084
00:46:28,360 --> 00:46:33,850
right it's always like intelligence

1085
00:46:31,030 --> 00:46:36,490
agencies<font color="#E5E5E5"> police military getting more</font>

1086
00:46:33,850 --> 00:46:38,500
power and not necessarily getting less

1087
00:46:36,490 --> 00:46:42,100
right it's very hard to shift things

1088
00:46:38,500 --> 00:46:44,560
back from that perspective so trying to

1089
00:46:42,100 --> 00:46:46,120
change this narrative and talking about

1090
00:46:44,560 --> 00:46:49,900
we should protect the end user and that

1091
00:46:46,120 --> 00:46:52,089
should also be a goal of<font color="#E5E5E5"> policymakers so</font>

1092
00:46:49,900 --> 00:46:54,610
that might even be saying well if you're

1093
00:46:52,090 --> 00:46:55,960
handling any kind of private data<font color="#CCCCCC"> then</font>

1094
00:46:54,610 --> 00:46:57,760
all the<font color="#E5E5E5"> connections should be encrypted</font>

1095
00:46:55,960 --> 00:47:00,010
and that is something that the companies

1096
00:46:57,760 --> 00:47:03,640
that are<font color="#E5E5E5"> handling the data should do etc</font>

1097
00:47:00,010 --> 00:47:08,890
etc so it's this kind of things<font color="#E5E5E5"> i think</font>

1098
00:47:03,640 --> 00:47:11,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">that could help getting a better defense</font>

1099
00:47:08,890 --> 00:47:13,839
<font color="#CCCCCC">under</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like very outskirts of what the</font>

1100
00:47:11,230 --> 00:47:16,210
internet is like the<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> end user</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and if</font>

1101
00:47:13,840 --> 00:47:19,750
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> end user is better defended</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> because</font>

1102
00:47:16,210 --> 00:47:22,660
we have a more secure internet and<font color="#E5E5E5"> more</font>

1103
00:47:19,750 --> 00:47:24,520

beyond that with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the kind of Internet of</font>

1107
00:47:29,500 --> 00:47:33,820
kill people that you just<font color="#CCCCCC"> having your</font>

1117
00:47:58,590 --> 00:48:02,790
going to be my norm<font color="#E5E5E5"> then the next</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> back</font>

1118
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:04,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">thing is like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay what's what's another</font>

document that outlines norms for you

1120
00:48:04,980 --> 00:48:08,850
that actually serves as a guiding

1127
00:48:20,160 --> 00:48:25,680
cyber security agencies actually are in

1128
00:48:22,770 --> 00:48:27,150
charge of abiding by this<font color="#E5E5E5"> role right</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font>

1129
00:48:25,680 --> 00:48:28,109
<font color="#E5E5E5">if you get them to the norm and then you</font>

look at the<font color="#CCCCCC"> National</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> cybersecurity</font>

good but if you look at the<font color="#CCCCCC"> french one</font>

1133
00:48:31,230 --> 00:48:35,430
<font color="#CCCCCC">is no mention of privacy</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> no mention of</font>

1139
00:48:43,440 --> 00:48:47,070

1140
00:48:45,390 --> 00:48:48,900
documents to actually set out a

1141

1143
00:48:51,180 --> 00:48:55,049
the norm<font color="#CCCCCC"> we can look at like what's the</font>

1144
00:48:52,890 --> 00:48:56,730
next best thing is actually going to be

1145
00:48:55,050 --> 00:48:58,200
used by the protection to<font color="#CCCCCC"> print the</font>

practitioners on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> government side</font>

1147
00:48:58,200 --> 00:49:02,009
<font color="#E5E5E5">that is supposed to remind their</font>

1148
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:03,300
strategy<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think i'm not saying</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

1149
00:49:02,010 --> 00:49:05,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">gonna save the world but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

1150
00:49:03,300 --> 00:49:07,830
would<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like a good first step</font>

1151
00:49:05,640 --> 00:49:13,900
I'm definitely not<font color="#E5E5E5"> seeing the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> national</font>

1152
00:49:07,830 --> 00:49:16,990

1153
00:49:13,900 --> 00:49:19,660
<font color="#CCCCCC">so I think one practical step towards</font>

1154
00:49:16,990 --> 00:49:20,720
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> and this is never going to have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> but</font>

1155
00:49:19,660 --> 00:49:23,839
three

1156
00:49:20,720 --> 00:49:28,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">good is it governments would start</font>

1157
00:49:23,840 --> 00:49:30,650
publishing<font color="#E5E5E5"> specs on their actual network</font>

1158
00:49:28,640 --> 00:49:33,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">infrastructures</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and things like that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

1159
00:49:30,650 --> 00:49:35,280
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> most of us here</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> or in the bed</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

1160
00:49:33,290 --> 00:49:39,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">your system can</font>

00:49:35,280 --> 00:49:40,170
<font color="#CCCCCC">go screaming</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that it's not secure that</font>

1162
00:49:39,240 --> 00:49:42,779
breaks it

1163
00:49:40,170 --> 00:49:45,840
that's a pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> weak system so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i think</font>

1164
00:49:42,780 --> 00:49:48,780
like we would never see your<font color="#CCCCCC"> RC</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

00:49:48,780 --> 00:49:52,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">could</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not get very far</font>

1167
00:49:50,100 --> 00:49:55,620
they would have to have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to write written</font>

00:49:52,350 --> 00:49:57,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">only</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> thing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that's bank like so we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font>

1169
00:49:55,620 --> 00:50:00,420
kind of<font color="#CCCCCC"> enforce some sort of</font>

1170
00:49:57,270 --> 00:50:03,330
documentation of how they're interacting

00:50:07,920 --> 00:50:15,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">use</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that yeah and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think that's a</font>

00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:16,350
really<font color="#CCCCCC"> good idea and something that just</font>

00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:19,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">sort of in my experience with Internet</font>

1178
00:50:23,340 --> 00:50:27,450
more open to I mean I think you see a

1179
00:50:25,050 --> 00:50:30,690
lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> like open legislation initiatives</font>

like in<font color="#CCCCCC"> Latin America it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not happening</font>

a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> where this sort of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty weak</font>

00:50:46,020 --> 00:50:52,590
yet and and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think those</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> kinds</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of new</font>

1187
00:50:49,620 --> 00:50:54,210
ideas or something like going out on a

1188
00:50:52,590 --> 00:50:56,070
limb like really looking at this from

1189
00:50:54,210 --> 00:50:57,810
like like an RFC like putting<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

1190
00:50:56,070 --> 00:51:00,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">way it's actually quite a great idea i</font>

1191
00:50:57,810 --> 00:51:02,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">would would maybe be something that</font>

1192
00:51:00,840 --> 00:51:06,870
people would consider<font color="#CCCCCC"> i mean i think you</font>

1193
00:51:02,910 --> 00:51:08,549
know the thing is<font color="#E5E5E5"> openness is really</font>

1194
00:51:06,870 --> 00:51:11,370
useful but again like there's this

1195
00:51:08,550 --> 00:51:14,640
perception that that the people are

1196
00:51:11,370 --> 00:51:16,680
threats they're not going to help<font color="#E5E5E5"> right</font>

1197
00:51:14,640 --> 00:51:18,660
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> technologists are at the table</font>

1198
00:51:16,680 --> 00:51:20,879
but these are technologists that have

1199
00:51:18,660 --> 00:51:23,399
gone to Ivy League institutions that

1200
00:51:20,880 --> 00:51:25,320
have spent time in government that maybe

1201
00:51:23,400 --> 00:51:27,090
they don't even have even<font color="#E5E5E5"> really decent</font>

1202
00:51:25,320 --> 00:51:29,550
technical expertise but<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're her</font>

1203
00:51:27,090 --> 00:51:32,520
again and again and again<font color="#CCCCCC"> sort of you</font>

1204
00:51:29,550 --> 00:51:35,070
know expert technocratic really<font color="#CCCCCC"> and so I</font>

1205
00:51:32,520 --> 00:51:37,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">think you know when if you think that</font>

1206
00:51:35,070 --> 00:51:38,940
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay opening up your</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

1207
00:51:37,110 --> 00:51:40,440
infrastructure as a way of like getting

1208
00:51:38,940 --> 00:51:43,680
a lot of eyes on it and making sure that

1209
00:51:40,440 --> 00:51:45,600
it's quite solid you know that there's

1210
00:51:43,680 --> 00:51:46,859
<font color="#E5E5E5">that the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> impulses not to say oh because</font>

1211
00:51:45,600 --> 00:51:47,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">there's a lot of really brilliant people</font>

1212
00:51:46,860 --> 00:51:50,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">out there that could help us</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

1213
00:51:47,970 --> 00:51:52,560
impulses<font color="#CCCCCC"> there</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are a lot of you know</font>

1214
00:51:50,220 --> 00:51:54,899
<font color="#E5E5E5">evilly genius people that could like</font>

1215
00:51:52,560 --> 00:51:56,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">attack house</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> right like that's the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

1216
00:51:54,900 --> 00:52:00,930
that's what we're trying to shift right

1217
00:51:56,190 --> 00:52:02,100
that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay I'm just me</font>

1218
00:52:00,930 --> 00:52:04,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">yeah when I think I think you're getting</font>

1219
00:52:02,100 --> 00:52:06,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">to a core piece of the puzzle we're</font>

1220
00:52:04,410 --> 00:52:09,779
trying to solve is that all<font color="#E5E5E5"> these things</font>

1221
00:52:06,150 --> 00:52:11,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">are absolutely horribly</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> over classified</font>

1222
00:52:09,780 --> 00:52:13,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">and more often than not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> governments are</font>

1223
00:52:11,940 --> 00:52:15,780
being like yeah we need to have a real

1224
00:52:13,530 --> 00:52:17,640
debate about that but<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm sorry we can't</font>

1225
00:52:15,780 --> 00:52:19,380
tell you anything is going on right and

1226
00:52:17,640 --> 00:52:21,240
so general Hayden for instance was a

1227
00:52:19,380 --> 00:52:22,860
former director of the CIA and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1228
00:52:21,240 --> 00:52:25,439
<font color="#CCCCCC">to say was asked about cyber operations</font>

1229
00:52:22,860 --> 00:52:27,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that's you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know definitely</font>

1230
00:52:25,440 --> 00:52:29,910
something we need to talk about and he

1231
00:52:27,210 --> 00:52:33,360
admitted that that thing was hideously

1232
00:52:29,910 --> 00:52:34,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">over classified he said hideously over</font>

1233
00:52:33,360 --> 00:52:35,760
classified

1234
00:52:34,290 --> 00:52:37,710
I think we have a real transparency

1235
00:52:35,760 --> 00:52:39,780
problem and the root of the transparency

1236
00:52:37,710 --> 00:52:41,400
problem is how<font color="#CCCCCC"> governments</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> decide to</font>

1237
00:52:39,780 --> 00:52:43,410
classify<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing pertaining to</font>

1238
00:52:41,400 --> 00:52:44,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">cybersecurity and how that hurts to</font>

1239
00:52:43,410 --> 00:52:51,330
human rights debate that needs to happen

1240
00:52:44,670 --> 00:52:52,800
in that space<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's our exit statement</font>

1241
00:52:51,330 --> 00:52:58,670
<font color="#CCCCCC">i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think so</font>

1242
00:52:52,800 --> 00:52:58,670
working group out
