<font color="#E5E5E5">to talk about building our own house and</font>

5
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:27,869
sometimes it involves hacks like

converting your<font color="#CCCCCC"> hyundai into it</font>

00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:46,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">so three</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> years ago look and I lived in</font>

the second story of a duplex in<font color="#CCCCCC"> san</font>

00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:56,489
for rent and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I had to work a job I</font>

13
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:59,459
really didn't like all the time and

14
00:00:56,489 --> 00:01:02,968
didn't have any extra timer<font color="#E5E5E5"> income for</font>

00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:06,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">art projects or other projects that i</font>

16
00:01:02,969 --> 00:01:08,280
was really passionate about<font color="#CCCCCC"> so at the</font>

17
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:11,880
end of our lease we dropped it and we

18
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:13,680
moved<font color="#CCCCCC"> onto this vacant lot and decided</font>

19
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:18,030
that we would start converting shipping

20
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:19,650
containers into tiny houses<font color="#E5E5E5"> we rented a</font>

21
00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:23,310
giant<font color="#CCCCCC"> forklift and spent the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> day doing</font>

22
00:01:19,650 --> 00:01:25,409
donuts in<font color="#CCCCCC"> kicking butt and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> then</font>

23
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:29,189
<font color="#CCCCCC">eventually moved our shipping containers</font>

24
00:01:25,409 --> 00:01:34,020
on the original idea is that we would

25
00:01:29,189 --> 00:01:37,350
build out to model units and show them

26
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:40,079
to people and sell the<font color="#CCCCCC"> unit's ready to</font>

27
00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:41,970
go as houses<font color="#E5E5E5"> and what we found was that</font>

28
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:43,589
<font color="#E5E5E5">our friends and kind of a larger</font>

29
00:01:41,970 --> 00:01:45,090
community came out of the woodwork and

30
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:47,430
was way more interested in learning how

31
00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:49,740
to build their own houses<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so we</font>

32
00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:50,939
started developing this community of

33
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:53,158
people who are interested in living

34
00:01:50,939 --> 00:01:54,898
<font color="#CCCCCC">off-grid</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of who were interested in</font>

35
00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:59,670
learning how to build and who are

36
00:01:54,899 --> 00:02:03,329
interested in like like<font color="#CCCCCC"> lifehack</font>

37
00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:05,399
experiments basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> but we got a</font>

38
00:02:03,329 --> 00:02:06,809
notice of violation from the city<font color="#CCCCCC"> they</font>

39
00:02:05,399 --> 00:02:10,590
were super thrilled about living<font color="#CCCCCC"> off</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">grid</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and many other things</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so in a hurry</font>

41
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:12,990
we had to pack up and move our shipping

42
00:02:12,510 --> 00:02:20,250
container

43
00:02:12,990 --> 00:02:21,870

00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:26,670
pretty adapted<font color="#E5E5E5"> moving shipping</font>

47
00:02:29,610 --> 00:02:32,910
us enough cover<font color="#E5E5E5"> to keep the project</font>

48
00:02:31,290 --> 00:02:35,310
going for a long time

49
00:02:32,910 --> 00:02:40,109
this is a 20,000 square-foot warehouse

50
00:02:35,310 --> 00:02:42,240
that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> moved the container into within</font>

51
00:02:40,110 --> 00:02:46,350
the first month we were at about eighty

52
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:49,980
percent capacity now word<font color="#E5E5E5"> slightly over</font>

53
00:02:46,350 --> 00:02:51,630
eighty percent capacity<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have 18</font>

54
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:54,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">houses under construction and it's</font>

55
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:56,850
essentially a<font color="#E5E5E5"> tiny house incubator where</font>

56
00:02:54,810 --> 00:02:59,220
people come they buy their own container

57
00:02:56,850 --> 00:03:02,700
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's a community that's dedicated</font>

58
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:05,640
to teaching each other how to build and

59
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:07,140
experiment with housing<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's also turned</font>

60
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:09,600
into basically just like a giant

61
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:12,989
playground<font color="#E5E5E5"> that big yellow cord at the</font>

65
00:03:19,710 --> 00:03:25,350
started to build out its really nice

66
00:03:22,470 --> 00:03:27,750
playing with small spaces and building

67
00:03:25,350 --> 00:03:29,579
your own house in general you can always

68
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:31,860
experiment with different materials

69
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:35,160
different layouts and it's really fun to

70
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:39,570
be able to kind of think through what

71
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:40,530
fits your lifestyle and what fits your

72
00:03:39,570 --> 00:03:46,049
desires

73
00:03:40,530 --> 00:03:48,660
here's my friends would<font color="#E5E5E5"> miser he needed</font>

74
00:03:46,050 --> 00:03:51,030
help<font color="#CCCCCC"> filling up some logs</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and so we went</font>

75
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:53,220
out and spent<font color="#E5E5E5"> the day helping him take</font>

76
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:55,710
care of all these<font color="#E5E5E5"> clear trees on his</font>

77
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:58,680
land in exchange you give us a bunch of

78
00:03:55,710 --> 00:04:00,570
logs and<font color="#CCCCCC"> about my kitchen counter out of</font>

79
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:03,480
one and<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's really awesome to be able</font>

80
00:04:00,570 --> 00:04:04,769
to take something from a raw material on

81
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:06,510
your own all the way through to a

82
00:04:04,770 --> 00:04:11,100
finished product or you know

83
00:04:06,510 --> 00:04:12,239
aspirationally finished<font color="#CCCCCC"> the other thing</font>

84
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:14,130
that's really cool about living in a

85
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:16,380
tiny house incubator is you get to see

86
00:04:14,130 --> 00:04:18,930
how other people think about space and

87
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:23,219
what problems they're designing<font color="#E5E5E5"> to solve</font>

88
00:04:18,930 --> 00:04:24,490
and here's our friend sean's house which

89
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:27,280
is pretty cute

90
00:04:24,490 --> 00:04:30,759
<font color="#CCCCCC">on all of our sites we try to have</font>

91
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:36,250
raised bed gardens and chickens

92
00:04:30,759 --> 00:04:37,720
although my dog makes chickens hard<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

93
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:39,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">sometimes forget to plant raised bed</font>

94
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:41,440
gardens but when we do plant them they

95
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:42,489
provide a lot of food and our

96
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:44,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">communities</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> been really good about</font>

97
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:46,720
taking it on and helping each other to

98
00:04:44,770 --> 00:04:49,210
keep the<font color="#E5E5E5"> garden going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> which is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

99
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:53,680
exciting to see<font color="#E5E5E5"> here's our security</font>

system<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the other thing that it's a</font>

101
00:04:53,680 --> 00:05:01,720
name<font color="#CCCCCC"> told me to do is have enough time</font>

102
00:04:55,840 --> 00:05:03,818
to make art<font color="#E5E5E5"> and travel this is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> surely</font>

104
00:05:03,819 --> 00:05:13,270
finish this installation so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm gonna</font>

105
00:05:10,690 --> 00:05:16,719
dig into the details<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I would posit</font>

106
00:05:13,270 --> 00:05:19,479
that any of you after like maybe 20

107
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:22,030
hours before a very hectic week of like

108
00:05:19,479 --> 00:05:24,280
learning basic skills that people think

109
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:26,109
are difficult but are really<font color="#E5E5E5"> glorified</font>

110
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:29,289
hot glue guns like welding and cutting

00:05:26,110 --> 00:05:32,409
<font color="#E5E5E5">wood you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> too can build a tiny house in</font>

00:05:29,289 --> 00:05:33,969
less than a week for less than<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10 k's</font>

113
00:05:32,409 --> 00:05:35,979
what like<font color="#CCCCCC"> two and a half months of</font>

00:05:33,969 --> 00:05:40,030
average rent in<font color="#CCCCCC"> New York right now to in</font>

this<font color="#CCCCCC"> i literally had to pay the</font>

giant gaping hole on the roof<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it was</font>

122
00:05:53,650 --> 00:05:58,448
just this huge pain in the ass literally

125
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:04,419
under the house and it made me really

126
00:06:02,289 --> 00:06:07,000
think that maybe there's maybe there are

127
00:06:04,419 --> 00:06:09,639
better alternatives<font color="#E5E5E5"> so I research stuff</font>

128
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:11,590
like this<font color="#E5E5E5"> after some research and a lot</font>

129
00:06:09,639 --> 00:06:13,840
of pretty photos like this realized that

<font color="#CCCCCC">I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was not in fact going to move to rural</font>

hundred thousand dollars to achieve

00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:25,270
something that would look half as good

135
00:06:23,169 --> 00:06:27,430
as this<font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I looked I looked for a</font>

00:06:25,270 --> 00:06:29,109
faster way<font color="#E5E5E5"> and after some</font>

137
00:06:27,430 --> 00:06:31,270
experimentation this is what this is

138
00:06:29,110 --> 00:06:33,219
what we arrived at this is the one that

139
00:06:31,270 --> 00:06:34,810
I<font color="#CCCCCC"> i moved out of recently</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> into a newer</font>

273
00:11:29,079 --> 00:11:32,199
<font color="#E5E5E5">walls</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and go either way you can either</font>

274
00:11:30,339 --> 00:11:33,790
do<font color="#CCCCCC"> two-by-fours and then just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> tack them</font>

275
00:11:32,199 --> 00:11:35,649
<font color="#CCCCCC">the walls in the corners with</font>

276
00:11:33,790 --> 00:11:36,790
self-tapping screws or you can do metal

277
00:11:35,649 --> 00:11:38,860
like we did on this one

278
00:11:36,790 --> 00:11:40,810
the point of this<font color="#CCCCCC"> either</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> way is to</font>

279
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:43,089
create space for<font color="#CCCCCC"> installation</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and to</font>

00:11:40,810 --> 00:11:46,089
attach your plywood<font color="#CCCCCC"> or</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sheetrock walls</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">to this is what its gonna look like when</font>

282
00:11:46,089 --> 00:11:52,449
it's done<font color="#E5E5E5"> you'll notice this metal is</font>

283
00:11:48,189 --> 00:11:54,790
back on and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's mounted on hinges so we</font>

284
00:11:52,449 --> 00:11:56,800
have that square tube just welded to the

285
00:11:54,790 --> 00:11:58,480
container to serve as a guide for<font color="#CCCCCC"> when</font>

00:11:56,800 --> 00:12:00,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">we're plasma cutting and then that also</font>

287
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:01,839
doubles to reinforce the otherwise

288
00:12:00,130 --> 00:12:04,930
flimsy steals that we now have nice

289
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:08,199
shades<font color="#E5E5E5"> structures when they're open and</font>

290
00:12:04,930 --> 00:12:10,239
adding a little bit of chain<font color="#E5E5E5"> and again</font>

291
00:12:08,199 --> 00:12:12,729
<font color="#CCCCCC">welding is not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> most of you probably have</font>

292
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:14,529
not welded<font color="#CCCCCC"> but it's not this difficult</font>

293
00:12:12,730 --> 00:12:16,420
thing particularly with like you're

294
00:12:14,529 --> 00:12:18,579
gonna be making airplanes or bike frames

295
00:12:16,420 --> 00:12:20,319
after a day of learning how to<font color="#E5E5E5"> weld but</font>

296
00:12:18,579 --> 00:12:22,989
you can totally do all the welding for

297
00:12:20,319 --> 00:12:26,380
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> after like an hour to two hours</font>

298
00:12:22,990 --> 00:12:28,959
this is what they look like from the

299
00:12:26,380 --> 00:12:32,019
outside when you're done<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> opted for</font>

300
00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:34,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">very</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> low cost blade runner</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> aesthetic</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">and that'll be that'll be a busy second</font>

day<font color="#CCCCCC"> your container</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> still won't be too</font>

304
00:12:42,290 --> 00:12:46,099
comfortable but after this day of

00:12:43,790 --> 00:12:48,349
<font color="#E5E5E5">insulation</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you'll be you'll be sleeping</font>

306
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:50,420
much more comfortably<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's super cheap</font>

307
00:12:48,350 --> 00:12:52,220
like many things with this<font color="#E5E5E5"> not because</font>

308
00:12:50,420 --> 00:12:54,680
we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> like some magical shortcut for</font>

309
00:12:52,220 --> 00:12:57,260
the material because it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> 260 Square</font>

310
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:58,640
feet<font color="#E5E5E5"> so it's not a lot of space to deal</font>

311
00:12:57,260 --> 00:13:00,710
with you can do things<font color="#CCCCCC"> and i encourage</font>

312
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:03,199
<font color="#CCCCCC">you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if you decide to do this tiny house</font>

313
00:13:00,710 --> 00:13:04,700
with a container otherwise like you can

314
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:06,470
do something that several dollars a

315
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:07,370
square foot that would like<font color="#E5E5E5"> bankrupt</font>

316
00:13:06,470 --> 00:13:09,290
that would cost more than this whole

317
00:13:07,370 --> 00:13:10,940
project on a<font color="#CCCCCC"> normal sized house because</font>

318
00:13:09,290 --> 00:13:11,780
it's a hundred sixty square feet<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's no</font>

319
00:13:10,940 --> 00:13:13,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">big deal</font>

320
00:13:11,780 --> 00:13:15,770
so again this is what<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's going to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> look</font>

321
00:13:13,940 --> 00:13:17,300
like when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you frame</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the insulation or</font>

322
00:13:15,770 --> 00:13:18,650
just replace those with<font color="#CCCCCC"> two-by-fours you</font>

323
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:20,810
want to do it that way<font color="#CCCCCC"> doesn't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

324
00:13:18,650 --> 00:13:22,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">matter</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we use this stuff called reflect</font>

325
00:13:20,810 --> 00:13:23,869
<font color="#CCCCCC">except it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like what you would put on</font>

326
00:13:22,250 --> 00:13:25,640
your windshield if you park in the Sun

327
00:13:23,870 --> 00:13:28,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">you can buy</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it at</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> home</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> depot or any</font>

328
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:30,170
other normal<font color="#CCCCCC"> super commodity thing if</font>

329
00:13:28,550 --> 00:13:33,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">you use two-by-fours</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your shoes the pink</font>

330
00:13:30,170 --> 00:13:35,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">nasty stuff we just glued this in also</font>

331
00:13:33,620 --> 00:13:38,120
just stuff it in<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not too</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> bad i mean</font>

332
00:13:35,780 --> 00:13:39,829
it's like makes you feel like you're in

333
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:40,790
a Faraday cage and you kind of are at

334
00:13:39,830 --> 00:13:42,350
this point you have to be careful

335
00:13:40,790 --> 00:13:43,819
actually with window placement for

336
00:13:42,350 --> 00:13:46,640
<font color="#CCCCCC">cellphone</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> reception we get like dead</font>

solid course it's like bamboo all the

347
00:14:07,460 --> 00:14:10,640
way through scratch it and you just see

<font color="#E5E5E5">slightly different colors</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of bamboo</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> no</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">it's like two dollars a square foot or</font>

00:14:13,430 --> 00:14:17,089
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> i would</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> recommend against the</font>

more of those and this<font color="#E5E5E5"> was one that we</font>

did for a friend<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then it's like</font>

360
00:14:32,630 --> 00:14:36,740
in most of my other aesthetic choices

361
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:40,610
but you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's it's your tiny house</font>

362
00:14:36,740 --> 00:14:41,780
do whatever you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> day</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for we're also</font>

363
00:14:40,610 --> 00:14:43,580
going to<font color="#CCCCCC"> do the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bedroom</font>

364
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:44,870
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is kinda can be plus or minus</font>

365
00:14:43,580 --> 00:14:46,820
depending on the mattress

366
00:14:44,870 --> 00:14:48,030
<font color="#CCCCCC">I like some</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> cheap ikea things</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> was around</font>

367
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:50,160
five hundred dollars

368
00:14:48,030 --> 00:14:53,010
total like sheets<font color="#E5E5E5"> mattress and</font>

369
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:55,199
everything my closet<font color="#CCCCCC"> is underneath this</font>

370
00:14:53,010 --> 00:14:57,120
is again just cheap plywood<font color="#CCCCCC"> put together</font>

371
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:59,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">if you have dogs like we do i would</font>

372
00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:00,240
recommend putting covers on that closet

373
00:14:59,070 --> 00:15:02,910
unless you want dog hair<font color="#E5E5E5"> and everything</font>

374
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:04,800
all the time like we have this is a

375
00:15:02,910 --> 00:15:06,719
projector screen<font color="#CCCCCC"> it was about a hundred</font>

376
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:10,170
sixty dollars it's motorized you press a

377
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:12,150
button and your projector screen that

378
00:15:10,170 --> 00:15:14,099
doubles as<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> de privacy divider for the</font>

bedroom<font color="#E5E5E5"> goes up or down</font>

380
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:17,850
there's a lot of hacks like that you'll

381
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:19,560
find as you go with this where you know

382
00:15:17,850 --> 00:15:20,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's crazy to have a thing going</font>

383
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:22,410
across your whole house it's a

<font color="#CCCCCC">normal-sized house be like a huge</font>

00:15:22,410 --> 00:15:27,480
engineering headache and tons of money

386
00:15:23,940 --> 00:15:30,900
but<font color="#CCCCCC"> tiny house</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> different story</font>

00:15:43,140 --> 00:15:48,540
five<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're gonna come in a little bit</font>

394
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:50,189
cheaper than that<font color="#CCCCCC"> to good sources of</font>

395
00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:52,230
equipment three actually

396
00:15:50,190 --> 00:15:54,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">for what you should consider putting in</font>

397
00:15:52,230 --> 00:15:57,600
your container or other tiny house are

398
00:15:54,600 --> 00:16:00,060
things people use in<font color="#CCCCCC"> arbys</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and things</font>

399
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:02,550
people use in boats<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then there's</font>

400
00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:04,589
also like a weird like cabin and camping

401
00:16:02,550 --> 00:16:06,870
thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> RVs and boats are the two main one</font>

402
00:16:04,590 --> 00:16:08,640
but also camping so like the best seller

that literally along with the solar

538
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:30,110
you're losing like ten percent with the

539
00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:33,350

540

this is really boards are like super

about space for these<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> hard</font>

608
00:24:10,820 --> 00:24:14,780
to find tiny spaces where people don't

609
00:24:12,770 --> 00:24:18,500
care what you do but it's relatively

610
00:24:14,780 --> 00:24:20,660
easy to find big spaces<font color="#E5E5E5"> so just find a</font>

611
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:22,520
big space and make some friends

612
00:24:20,660 --> 00:24:24,740
you'll be surprised how easy it is to

613
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:27,740
find other people who want a space where

614
00:24:24,740 --> 00:24:29,419
they can build some stuff<font color="#CCCCCC"> call it a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 24-7</font>

00:24:30,410 --> 00:24:34,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">um and yeah i mean like in our case it</font>

618
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:37,220
makes sense to pay for a whole warehouse

<font color="#E5E5E5">just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to to make</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> these happen a little</font>

00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:42,149
thing to look for there is at least in

it like sneak aboard<font color="#E5E5E5"> so don't just call</font>

821
00:32:49,590 --> 00:32:52,770
and ask if you have a little bored

822
00:32:50,700 --> 00:32:54,750
available because they probably won't go

823
00:32:52,770 --> 00:32:57,030
and get to know some of the people and

824
00:32:54,750 --> 00:32:59,250
you very likely<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know if you don't</font>

00:32:59,250 --> 00:33:07,510
probably still get away with living

prohibits the use of boats as a building

831
00:33:15,900 --> 00:33:23,070
and you will get fined up to 10,000

833
00:33:23,070 --> 00:33:27,149
that brings up a really good point

834
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:28,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">um there's the written regulations and</font>

835
00:33:27,150 --> 00:33:31,620
then there's the realpolitik regulations

836
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:33,510
in<font color="#CCCCCC"> oakland you're not allowed to park an</font>

as any of the other zoning laws<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">breaking but it's just totally not</font>

841
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:45,510
enforced so again like if you really

842
00:33:41,970 --> 00:33:47,460
like location like we do<font color="#CCCCCC"> Oakland it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

00:33:45,510 --> 00:33:49,560

844
00:33:47,460 --> 00:33:51,090
I wish it was fairly enforced<font color="#CCCCCC"> 00</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> zoning</font>

845
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:53,070
pretty much everywhere that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I've heard</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">of is based on complaints so it's like</font>

else

851
00:34:00,390 --> 00:34:04,500
compared to them and you probably won't

852
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:06,659
get reported<font color="#CCCCCC"> so it's this lovely racial</font>

853
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:07,980
undertone to it<font color="#E5E5E5"> but yeah there's a</font>

854
00:34:06,660 --> 00:34:15,210
difference between the written zoning

855
00:34:07,980 --> 00:34:17,119
and what is actually enforced<font color="#E5E5E5"> containers</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">two-by-four up when we were putting</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

862
00:34:33,010 --> 00:34:38,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">like metal studs across the roof so our</font>

00:34:35,380 --> 00:34:38,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">roofs our boat a little bit which gives</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">runoff</font>

00:34:40,300 --> 00:34:48,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">now so there's no weather ever</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that we</font>

array up above the roof

869
00:34:50,290 --> 00:34:55,449
it was also a really good way of

870
00:34:52,149 --> 00:34:58,120
providing kind of an<font color="#CCCCCC"> error back</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> gap and</font>

871
00:34:55,449 --> 00:34:59,890
his was slightly sloped so anything that

00:34:58,120 --> 00:35:03,730
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> any time it did rain</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> would run off</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">stayed pretty even temperature</font>

875
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:19,510
yeah that's about it

876
00:35:10,870 --> 00:35:23,650
spaces<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> flying</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">was how do you find spaces there's</font>

and seeing a sign like the<font color="#CCCCCC"> date went up</font>

884
00:35:35,350 --> 00:35:39,759
by dumb luck

885
00:35:36,430 --> 00:35:41,859
this is a weird<font color="#CCCCCC"> shitty website that you</font>

can use to find for<font color="#CCCCCC"> at least</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> commercial</font>

887
00:35:41,860 --> 00:35:46,270
things again like there's the

everyone will say no to that<font color="#E5E5E5"> most</font>

892
00:35:54,100 --> 00:35:58,150
landlords will say yes to rent

your business too much<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's I've had</font>

00:36:19,190 --> 00:36:22,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">the question was city locations can we</font>

00:36:21,380 --> 00:36:24,170
get a way with a lot more in<font color="#E5E5E5"> Oakland in</font>

San<font color="#E5E5E5"> Francisco</font>

900
00:36:24,170 --> 00:36:27,650
we thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> so that was part of why we</font>

901
00:36:26,150 --> 00:36:30,319
moved to<font color="#CCCCCC"> San Francisco</font>

a part-time<font color="#CCCCCC"> artist and is on record like</font>

906
00:36:36,349 --> 00:36:40,099
four years ago saying you know it's

907
00:36:38,300 --> 00:36:41,750
tough to afford to live in the city so

908
00:36:40,099 --> 00:36:44,839
far to start living in commercial spaces

909
00:36:41,750 --> 00:36:46,700
we just kind of<font color="#CCCCCC"> turned a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> blind eye</font>

00:36:50,869 --> 00:36:55,310
yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> I mean</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the other thing is like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

914

with the design elements with location

with everything about this<font color="#E5E5E5"> treated more</font>

an idea is to<font color="#E5E5E5"> use shipping containers or</font>

and then it's like a little cheaper as

00:43:03,930 --> 00:43:09,089
somewhere more rural<font color="#CCCCCC"> so lastly why</font>

1058
00:43:07,019 --> 00:43:12,689
you're saying about how do you decide

1059
00:43:09,089 --> 00:43:15,599
when<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> there to property that's</font>

1060
00:43:12,690 --> 00:43:17,130
looking at<font color="#CCCCCC"> naked by the property and to</font>

1061
00:43:15,599 --> 00:43:19,259
<font color="#CCCCCC">and really</font>

1062
00:43:17,130 --> 00:43:20,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> lot but then you're stuck with it</font>

1063
00:43:19,259 --> 00:43:25,440
because

1064
00:43:20,730 --> 00:43:27,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">how do you decide</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> fight vs move um first</font>

1065
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:29,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">of all in my experience it's not</font>

1066
00:43:27,510 --> 00:43:32,220
necessarily that binary<font color="#E5E5E5"> like the one we</font>

1067
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:33,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">own that we got kicked off of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we're</font>

1068
00:43:32,220 --> 00:43:37,919
still fighting about<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're just taking a</font>

1069
00:43:33,780 --> 00:43:40,470
different approach and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I it sounds corny</font>

1070
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:42,660
but like honestly<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think a lot of why</font>

1071
00:43:40,470 --> 00:43:44,220
some of these intentional communities

1072
00:43:42,660 --> 00:43:46,350
the middle of nowhere and even

1073
00:43:44,220 --> 00:43:48,839
hackerspaces fail<font color="#E5E5E5"> is that it stops being</font>

1074
00:43:46,350 --> 00:43:51,029
fun like it should continue to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

1075
00:43:48,840 --> 00:43:52,890
consider it ridiculous that we like 25

1076
00:43:51,030 --> 00:43:54,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">our friends illegally living in an</font>

1077
00:43:52,890 --> 00:43:56,580
awesome warehouse with three kinds of

1078
00:43:54,390 --> 00:43:57,900
beer on tap and fast internet for six

1079
00:43:56,580 --> 00:43:59,610
hundred dollars a month each

1080
00:43:57,900 --> 00:44:01,890
like that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> ridiculous</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and entertaining</font>

1081
00:43:59,610 --> 00:44:03,480
and if it stops being entertaining<font color="#CCCCCC"> then</font>

1082
00:44:01,890 --> 00:44:06,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">I'm not going to be as excited about</font>

1083
00:44:03,480 --> 00:44:08,100
like you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> cleaning</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> up the dog shit</font>

1084
00:44:06,120 --> 00:44:10,020
and the other crap that comes with

1085
00:44:08,100 --> 00:44:12,420
keeping the community going

1086
00:44:10,020 --> 00:44:13,770
um yeah so like it should continue to be

1087
00:44:12,420 --> 00:44:15,960
fun if it seems like it's gonna be more

1088
00:44:13,770 --> 00:44:18,240
fun to just move<font color="#CCCCCC"> then do that</font>

1089
00:44:15,960 --> 00:44:20,610
another advantage<font color="#CCCCCC"> of doing things like</font>

1090
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:21,810
this in<font color="#CCCCCC"> oakland</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is like if we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> leave</font>

1091
00:44:20,610 --> 00:44:22,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">enough to sell the property it's not</font>

1092
00:44:21,810 --> 00:44:24,960
gonna be the end of the world<font color="#E5E5E5"> where I</font>

00:44:22,860 --> 00:44:27,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">was like you know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a mohawk Iowa</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> might be</font>

00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:29,970
a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> little harder to like get all</font>

1095
00:44:27,870 --> 00:44:33,960
of our money back that we put into the

1096
00:44:29,970 --> 00:44:36,180
property

1097
00:44:33,960 --> 00:44:40,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">with the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> single most single thing that</font>

you miss the most

00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:46,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">the question was what each of us what is</font>

the single most thing we miss the most

1101

right now<font color="#CCCCCC"> I miss having a kitchen but</font>

1103
00:44:54,340 --> 00:45:01,810
it's really only because<font color="#CCCCCC"> i haven't built</font>

00:45:03,700 --> 00:45:07,660
having my house outside like it was

1107
00:45:06,490 --> 00:45:09,879
amazing

<font color="#E5E5E5">having an outdoor shipping container</font>

00:45:11,349 --> 00:45:15,760
like always a bonfire when you get home

1111
00:45:13,330 --> 00:45:17,680

it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> very mild climate challenge</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

1177
00:48:09,060 --> 00:48:12,990
would recommend propane<font color="#CCCCCC"> over</font>

1178
00:48:11,640 --> 00:48:15,540
unfortunately unless you put<font color="#CCCCCC"> in like a</font>

really big solar array<font color="#CCCCCC"> particularly in</font>

the winter<font color="#E5E5E5"> when you're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> acting as much</font>

1181
00:48:16,589 --> 00:48:20,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">Sun anyways i would</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> recommend going with</font>

1182
00:48:18,210 --> 00:48:21,839
like a propane heater with a little<font color="#CCCCCC"> get</font>

1183
00:48:20,220 --> 00:48:23,730
for something like twice the size and

1184
00:48:21,839 --> 00:48:25,830
you will never be<font color="#CCCCCC"> cold</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like we would</font>

1185
00:48:23,730 --> 00:48:28,109
wake up hot with our propane heater when

1186
00:48:25,830 --> 00:48:30,569
it was outside<font color="#CCCCCC"> I mean the other thing</font>

1187
00:48:28,109 --> 00:48:32,400
too is your heating a hundred and sixty

1188
00:48:30,570 --> 00:48:34,410
square feet it takes about two minutes

that<font color="#CCCCCC"> i would check out I do not</font>

these underground<font color="#CCCCCC"> had like some weird</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">access hatch that I guess looks like a</font>

1204
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:20,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">so people are definitely doing it</font>

1205
00:49:17,160 --> 00:49:22,290
um yeah that's about all I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> he</font>

1206
00:49:20,130 --> 00:49:25,500
flipped some of them over because the

1207
00:49:22,290 --> 00:49:27,300
floor<font color="#CCCCCC"> can handle more load than the roof</font>

1208
00:49:25,500 --> 00:49:29,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">and if you're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> burying it that's I guess</font>

1209
00:49:27,300 --> 00:49:30,690
that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be your main load that's</font>

1210
00:49:29,040 --> 00:49:32,970
gonna have more force from the ground

1211
00:49:30,690 --> 00:49:37,150
compacting down on it so<font color="#CCCCCC"> that experiment</font>

1212
00:49:32,970 --> 00:49:41,160
a little more<font color="#E5E5E5"> careful with that one</font>

1214
00:49:41,160 --> 00:49:46,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">yeah that's a good point</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> if you put it</font>

1215
00:49:44,280 --> 00:49:49,170
underground there's less as a no issue

1216
00:49:46,230 --> 00:49:51,630
with heating and cooling<font color="#E5E5E5"> average annual</font>

00:49:55,980 --> 00:49:59,220
google like average temperature

1221
00:49:57,569 --> 00:50:00,869
somewhere to figure out what ground

00:50:02,369 --> 00:50:15,890
need any<font color="#CCCCCC"> insulation</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> underground sweet</font>

1226
00:50:15,890 --> 00:50:20,060
done it from a little bit in that book

1227
00:50:17,450 --> 00:50:21,830
that i read this dude was recommending

1228
00:50:20,060 --> 00:50:24,529
surrounding everything with pond liner

1229
00:50:21,830 --> 00:50:27,200
HDPE it's like this<font color="#CCCCCC"> thick it's like a</font>

1230
00:50:24,530 --> 00:50:29,780
bike tire but like even more waterproof

1231
00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:32,210
and like twice as thick<font color="#E5E5E5"> so like anything</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was doing a garden on the roof or</font>

more expensive or<font color="#E5E5E5"> reuse materials like</font>

what do you think the<font color="#CCCCCC"> trade-off is</font>

around like the environment<font color="#CCCCCC"> across from</font>

that<font color="#CCCCCC"> like I know a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of construction</font>

way that you want to be more

environmentally friendly or not<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

1253
00:51:19,859 --> 00:51:25,619
concerned about<font color="#CCCCCC"> this issue</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> yeah</font>

1254
00:51:23,430 --> 00:51:30,089
man

1255
00:51:25,619 --> 00:51:31,859
<font color="#CCCCCC">I think partly because when we started</font>

1256
00:51:30,089 --> 00:51:35,430
building we wanted to document it and

1257
00:51:31,859 --> 00:51:35,910
make it feasible for everybody to build

1258
00:51:35,430 --> 00:51:37,799
one

1259
00:51:35,910 --> 00:51:40,710
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're using readily available</font>

1260
00:51:37,799 --> 00:51:46,140
materials with a little bit less focus

1261
00:51:40,710 --> 00:51:48,480
on environmental stuff but<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think in</font>

1262
00:51:46,140 --> 00:51:50,220
general like<font color="#E5E5E5"> tiny house like you're</font>

1263
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:53,549
reducing your carbon footprint so much

1264
00:51:50,220 --> 00:51:55,169
by what you're doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> but then yeah i</font>

1265
00:51:53,549 --> 00:51:57,749
mean like i don't know there's a lot of

1266
00:51:55,170 --> 00:52:00,059
<font color="#CCCCCC">oh we're so screwed</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> because embedded</font>

1267
00:51:57,749 --> 00:52:02,038
energy and everything<font color="#E5E5E5"> like if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I cannot</font>

1268
00:52:00,059 --> 00:52:03,749
build something out of cement and get

1269
00:52:02,039 --> 00:52:07,319
the same performance I want other<font color="#E5E5E5"> than</font>

1270
00:52:03,749 --> 00:52:09,390
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> like the price doesn't seem worth</font>

1271
00:52:07,319 --> 00:52:12,869
it<font color="#CCCCCC"> i can make one of these and happily</font>

1272
00:52:09,390 --> 00:52:14,910
sell it for like under 30k<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

1273
00:52:12,869 --> 00:52:16,680
including paying people to help me and

1274
00:52:14,910 --> 00:52:19,499
being really happy with how they're

1275
00:52:16,680 --> 00:52:20,999
treated in the materials I use<font color="#CCCCCC"> if I even</font>

1276
00:52:19,499 --> 00:52:23,549
like switching the<font color="#CCCCCC"> insulation like you</font>

1277
00:52:20,999 --> 00:52:25,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">got</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a recycled denim or something then</font>

1278
00:52:23,549 --> 00:52:27,720
you're at like five to<font color="#E5E5E5"> 10</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> x the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> cost</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

1279
00:52:25,950 --> 00:52:29,490
wish it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> more inexpensive and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm</font>

1280
00:52:27,720 --> 00:52:32,308
<font color="#E5E5E5">definitely contributing to the problem</font>

1281
00:52:29,490 --> 00:52:35,038
by not<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know being more demand for it</font>

1282
00:52:32,309 --> 00:52:36,539
but until until there's like I mean like

1283
00:52:35,039 --> 00:52:38,609
the bamboo flooring has<font color="#E5E5E5"> crossed that</font>

1284
00:52:36,539 --> 00:52:40,410
threshold for me<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'll let</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> let people</font>

1285
00:52:38,609 --> 00:52:42,239
building big shitty houses get prices

1286
00:52:40,410 --> 00:52:44,308
more sustainable materials down and then

1287
00:52:42,239 --> 00:52:46,140
like I think you're right that we have

1288
00:52:44,309 --> 00:52:53,730
like an obligation to look at that<font color="#CCCCCC"> over</font>

1289
00:52:46,140 --> 00:52:58,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">time I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> cool thanks everybody finest</font>

1290
00:52:53,730 --> 00:53:06,639
