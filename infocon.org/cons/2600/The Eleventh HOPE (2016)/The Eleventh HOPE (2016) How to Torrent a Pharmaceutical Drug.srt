00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:28,560
attention just like programming right

138
00:06:27,090 --> 00:06:30,119
<font color="#CCCCCC">whenever</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you write a program it's like</font>

139
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:31,770
there's some menial<font color="#E5E5E5"> tasks that you don't</font>

140
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:33,690
want to have to pay attention to<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so</font>

141
00:06:31,770 --> 00:06:35,919
you say hey<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can get this computer to</font>

142
00:06:33,690 --> 00:06:41,080
do this<font color="#CCCCCC"> so the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> question is</font>

143
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:42,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">how do you make a drop well it's done by</font>

144
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:46,840
chemistry right<font color="#E5E5E5"> chemist do in the lab</font>

145
00:06:42,940 --> 00:06:50,020
can we automate it

146
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:52,780
well sure

147
00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:57,640
so the thing is if you ever read through

148
00:06:52,780 --> 00:07:00,580
a procedure on how to make something<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

149
00:06:57,640 --> 00:07:02,890
lab<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's typically pretty boring</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

150
00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:05,830
have a thing that says something like in

151
00:07:02,890 --> 00:07:07,390
this solvent<font color="#CCCCCC"> add material</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a and then add</font>

152
00:07:05,830 --> 00:07:10,240
material<font color="#E5E5E5"> B and then stir at this</font>

153
00:07:07,390 --> 00:07:12,430
temperature for this amount of time and

154
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:14,050
<font color="#CCCCCC">they're okay and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> then it continues and</font>

155
00:07:12,430 --> 00:07:15,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's usually on the order of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ours</font>

156
00:07:14,050 --> 00:07:16,690
right<font color="#E5E5E5"> so it's something that you would</font>

157
00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:21,220
leave overnight or you<font color="#CCCCCC"> leaving</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you go to</font>

158
00:07:16,690 --> 00:07:23,080
lunch or and so in historically<font color="#E5E5E5"> research</font>

159
00:07:21,220 --> 00:07:24,430
<font color="#CCCCCC">chemist have a graduate student do that</font>

160
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:27,099
because that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> how you give all the</font>

161
00:07:24,430 --> 00:07:30,010
horrible work<font color="#E5E5E5"> too but eventually some</font>

162
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:32,500
clever<font color="#CCCCCC"> professor somewhere said</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what you</font>

163
00:07:30,010 --> 00:07:34,750
know<font color="#CCCCCC"> I really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> could have my graduate</font>

164
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:37,270
students doing better things

165
00:07:34,750 --> 00:07:39,730
why<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't we just automate this these</font>

166
00:07:37,270 --> 00:07:41,620
are commercial<font color="#CCCCCC"> automated lab</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> reactors</font>

167
00:07:39,730 --> 00:07:44,050
<font color="#CCCCCC">now if you look at him</font>

168
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:46,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">they're not super complicated right you</font>

169
00:07:44,050 --> 00:07:48,550
have a reaction chamber<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the center</font>

170
00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:50,320
right so this is a glass enclosure and

171
00:07:48,550 --> 00:07:51,310
you can see that these two versions

172
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:53,500
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are a lot of different versions</font>

173
00:07:51,310 --> 00:07:55,330
out there<font color="#CCCCCC"> these</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> two versions on our</font>

176
00:07:58,300 --> 00:08:06,280
what<font color="#CCCCCC"> you got is a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you've got an outside</font>

177
00:08:02,020 --> 00:08:07,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">glass enclosure and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> then the inside</font>

178
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:10,030
glass enclosure<font color="#E5E5E5"> where the reaction is</font>

179
00:08:07,510 --> 00:08:12,039
actually happening<font color="#E5E5E5"> the outer one has a</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">temperature to try and hold the</font>

182
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:19,840
temperature of the material<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's a</font>

183
00:08:17,230 --> 00:08:23,560
bar that comes down in the center<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

184
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:25,690
stirs and then you can see<font color="#CCCCCC"> the reports</font>

185
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:26,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">in the top for various things so if you</font>

186
00:08:25,690 --> 00:08:30,550
have to do something under a particular

187
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:32,380
gaseous atmosphere you can do that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

188
00:08:30,550 --> 00:08:34,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">can see the one on the right</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the top</font>

189
00:08:32,380 --> 00:08:36,789
thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's a thermal couples coming in</font>

190
00:08:34,030 --> 00:08:38,530
to test the temperature<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> MIT provide</font>

192
00:08:38,530 --> 00:08:42,010
<font color="#CCCCCC">it's being held at the proper</font>

193
00:08:39,490 --> 00:08:45,220
temperature and then the other ports you

194
00:08:42,010 --> 00:08:48,160
can do things like<font color="#CCCCCC"> a vacuum and inject</font>

195
00:08:45,220 --> 00:08:49,240
new<font color="#E5E5E5"> reagents so some of these are</font>

196
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:51,939
sophisticated and<font color="#E5E5E5"> now</font>

197
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:54,310
off that you just load all of your

198
00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:56,980
reagents<font color="#CCCCCC"> your catalysts and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

199
00:08:54,310 --> 00:09:00,369
<font color="#E5E5E5">solvents into tubes</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the top and you</font>

200
00:08:56,980 --> 00:09:04,149
literally stick a USB key in and go<font color="#CCCCCC"> poop</font>

201
00:09:00,370 --> 00:09:05,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">one</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and you go home and it takes care of</font>

202
00:09:04,149 --> 00:09:08,170
everything you come back and you have

203
00:09:05,770 --> 00:09:09,399
your end product<font color="#CCCCCC"> pretty much which is</font>

204
00:09:08,170 --> 00:09:12,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">pretty cool</font>

205
00:09:09,399 --> 00:09:15,399
the problem with these is that they're

206
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:19,000
extraordinarily expensive because

207
00:09:15,399 --> 00:09:22,899
<font color="#E5E5E5">they're only sold two hot hot research</font>

208
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:24,279
labs and although<font color="#CCCCCC"> I know all of you are</font>

209
00:09:22,899 --> 00:09:25,810
gonna go to the social engineering talk

210
00:09:24,279 --> 00:09:32,290
later<font color="#E5E5E5"> but they're technically only</font>

211
00:09:25,810 --> 00:09:34,149
supposed to be sold<font color="#CCCCCC"> to labs</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so even so</font>

212
00:09:32,290 --> 00:09:37,149
if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have the cash and still a little</font>

213
00:09:34,149 --> 00:09:40,120
tricky to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> so the question is can we</font>

214
00:09:37,149 --> 00:09:43,810
do this ourselves

215
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:46,180
sort of<font color="#E5E5E5"> why isn't there a DIY version of</font>

216
00:09:43,810 --> 00:09:48,489
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> or</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> di why not</font>

217
00:09:46,180 --> 00:09:50,469
<font color="#E5E5E5">well there is and so for those</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

218
00:09:48,490 --> 00:09:52,839
can't see up here<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm gonna</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

219
00:09:50,470 --> 00:09:54,550
switch<font color="#E5E5E5"> over to a document camera so you</font>

220
00:09:52,839 --> 00:09:57,070
can see some of this gear but this is a

221
00:09:54,550 --> 00:10:00,849
picture of the debating<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's on the left</font>

222
00:09:57,070 --> 00:10:01,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">side of the table here and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> actually</font>

223
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:06,550
this was the offer you that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm sorry</font>

224
00:10:01,990 --> 00:10:09,010
this is only your left over here so this

225
00:10:06,550 --> 00:10:11,050
<font color="#CCCCCC">is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the top and it's very very</font>

226
00:10:09,010 --> 00:10:14,050
rudimentary<font color="#CCCCCC"> right it's very simple</font>

227
00:10:11,050 --> 00:10:18,490
I've got two tubes coming in that<font color="#CCCCCC"> runs</font>

228
00:10:14,050 --> 00:10:20,380
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> a pump this circulates liquid arm on</font>

229
00:10:18,490 --> 00:10:22,600
the on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> left there you can see the</font>

230
00:10:20,380 --> 00:10:26,380
power cable coming in that's just a<font color="#CCCCCC"> tee</font>

231
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:29,320
warmer and then on the right there's a

232
00:10:26,380 --> 00:10:30,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">thermal couple</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and that's sending to a</font>

233
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:32,649
feedback<font color="#E5E5E5"> system</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sending to a PID</font>

234
00:10:30,790 --> 00:10:35,500
controller which is a proportional

235
00:10:32,649 --> 00:10:37,420
integral derivative controller<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's</font>

236
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:39,820
just trying to keep the temperature and

237
00:10:37,420 --> 00:10:41,740
concentrate<font color="#E5E5E5"> and if you want to and if</font>

238
00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:44,649
you can see over here on the right<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

239
00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:47,470
running<font color="#E5E5E5"> and on the top that's just a</font>

240
00:10:44,649 --> 00:10:51,850
bicycle tube<font color="#E5E5E5"> nipple so that you can</font>

241
00:10:47,470 --> 00:10:53,410
control pressure or in<font color="#E5E5E5"> inject an</font>

242
00:10:51,850 --> 00:10:56,079
atmosphere of something else<font color="#E5E5E5"> if need be</font>

243
00:10:53,410 --> 00:10:58,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">and I have a little baby compressor pump</font>

244
00:10:56,079 --> 00:11:00,579
that runs that<font color="#E5E5E5"> that can also be reversed</font>

245
00:10:58,990 --> 00:11:02,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">if you're running under vacuum so this</font>

246
00:11:00,579 --> 00:11:02,859
<font color="#E5E5E5">was how it started</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like well that</font>

247
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:04,660
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> should</font>

248
00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:08,050
<font color="#CCCCCC">me too hard we should be able to stir</font>

249
00:11:04,660 --> 00:11:09,880
and heat<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> set periods of time without</font>

00:11:08,050 --> 00:11:13,599
needing to spend tens of thousands of

251
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:15,730
dollars<font color="#CCCCCC"> so again here's the control</font>

252
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:17,590
circuitry<font color="#CCCCCC"> um</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that's the PID</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> controller</font>

253
00:11:15,730 --> 00:11:21,460
on the left and on the right<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's the</font>

254
00:11:17,590 --> 00:11:24,790
compressor pump on the lower left<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's</font>

255
00:11:21,460 --> 00:11:26,200
a light that blinks<font color="#CCCCCC"> because it's</font>

256
00:11:24,790 --> 00:11:27,280
important to have user feedback to know

00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:29,920
that something's<font color="#E5E5E5"> happening</font>

00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:33,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is light blinking over there awesome</font>

259
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:35,439
<font color="#E5E5E5">so something's happening</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> working</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font>

260
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:41,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">but this was this was a very basics</font>

261
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:42,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">setup it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> worked fine but we didn't do</font>

262
00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:44,680
anything super sophisticated with it

263
00:11:42,820 --> 00:11:46,780
right we managed to make aspirin which

264
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:48,459
is a very shaken bake reaction is very

265
00:11:46,780 --> 00:11:50,110
simple but it works<font color="#E5E5E5"> right</font>

266
00:11:48,460 --> 00:11:52,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">it's able to maintain temperature it can</font>

268
00:11:52,930 --> 00:11:58,060
etc<font color="#CCCCCC"> the next step of course is how to</font>

269
00:11:57,010 --> 00:12:02,110
automate it

270
00:11:58,060 --> 00:12:04,839
well we now<font color="#E5E5E5"> have really nice hackable</font>

271
00:12:02,110 --> 00:12:06,370
drivers<font color="#E5E5E5"> so this was this is the start of</font>

272
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:07,750
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> beta unit</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this is sort of a an</font>

273
00:12:06,370 --> 00:12:09,550
earlier version but you can see this is

274
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:14,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">just a breadboard</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and it's an arduino</font>

275
00:12:09,550 --> 00:12:19,510
micro the<font color="#CCCCCC"> arduino micro is wired to</font>

276
00:12:14,770 --> 00:12:21,250
these<font color="#E5E5E5"> relay banks now if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> if like actual</font>

277
00:12:19,510 --> 00:12:23,530
wiring that's a mess like this makes you

278
00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:24,970
nervous like don't let it<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok that the</font>

279
00:12:23,530 --> 00:12:27,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">only reason that there are a bunch of</font>

280
00:12:24,970 --> 00:12:29,110
relays<font color="#E5E5E5"> is because we wanted to be able</font>

281
00:12:27,430 --> 00:12:31,120
to handle a little more current<font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font>

282
00:12:29,110 --> 00:12:33,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">essentially what you're having</font>

283
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:39,520
what we had to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> with this juncture was</font>

284
00:12:33,340 --> 00:12:43,000
it would trip this transistor and the

285
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:48,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">relay bank would switch and so one was</font>

286
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:51,760
one was for the<font color="#CCCCCC"> steering</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> apparatus</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> one</font>

287
00:12:48,370 --> 00:12:55,210
was to kick on and off the heater<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

288
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:59,230
then the<font color="#E5E5E5"> third one was going to run a</font>

289
00:12:55,210 --> 00:13:04,120
device<font color="#E5E5E5"> that actually inject new reagents</font>

290
00:12:59,230 --> 00:13:07,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">are so so here it is running and as you</font>

291
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:08,870
can see there are blinking lights<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

292
00:13:07,060 --> 00:13:11,900
things are happening

293
00:13:08,870 --> 00:13:17,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">um really important blinking lights</font>

294
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:19,699
<font color="#CCCCCC">oh I need this one is blinking</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> get so</font>

295
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:21,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">you can also see coming off the side</font>

296
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:24,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">there's a temperature and humidity</font>

298
00:13:24,710 --> 00:13:27,020
that but this was sort of just a test

299
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:32,000
run to make sure that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> could actually</font>

300
00:13:27,020 --> 00:13:33,170
make<font color="#E5E5E5"> it work so that's basically all you</font>

301
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,000
need right the the elements are<font color="#E5E5E5"> there</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">temperature and you need to be able to</font>

304
00:13:37,310 --> 00:13:40,579
inject reagents<font color="#E5E5E5"> now the question of</font>

305
00:13:38,990 --> 00:13:43,250
injecting<font color="#CCCCCC"> reagents is little touchy</font>

306
00:13:40,580 --> 00:13:45,320
right you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> an in the old version</font>

307
00:13:43,250 --> 00:13:48,440
there's this pump is continuously

308
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:50,390
streaming liquid in and out in the new

309
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:53,839
version<font color="#E5E5E5"> we had to have something that</font>

310
00:13:50,390 --> 00:13:59,270
would actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> shovel it in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so there's</font>

00:13:53,839 --> 00:14:00,680
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> which was developed by some open</font>

314
00:14:03,830 --> 00:14:08,720
see in the back there is a stepper motor

315
00:14:05,990 --> 00:14:11,000
and then there's a coupler<font color="#E5E5E5"> and this is</font>

00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:13,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">just a threaded shaft and these are 3d</font>

321
00:14:21,830 --> 00:14:26,959
like an eighties<font color="#E5E5E5"> cassette driver</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> had a</font>

me gave me sleep<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay i think this would</font>

325
00:14:30,290 --> 00:14:36,860
just drop in so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I got lucky</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with that</font>

326
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:38,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">the syringe itself if you go to build</font>

327
00:14:36,860 --> 00:14:39,770
this right the<font color="#CCCCCC"> open-source syringe pump</font>

328
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:41,510
is out there and you can you can

329
00:14:39,770 --> 00:14:45,709
download the files and everything<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

330
00:14:41,510 --> 00:14:51,470
syringe<font color="#CCCCCC"> they don't give specifics on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font>

331
00:14:45,709 --> 00:14:53,869
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's a 60 milliliter syringe and they're</font>

332
00:14:51,470 --> 00:14:55,700
typically used for feeding baby calves

333
00:14:53,870 --> 00:14:56,450
so you can get it at like farm supply

334
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:57,770
stuff

335
00:14:56,450 --> 00:15:02,089
this took me<font color="#CCCCCC"> awhile</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to figure out so</font>

336
00:14:57,770 --> 00:15:05,510
there's a there's a tip on that one<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

337
00:15:02,089 --> 00:15:09,290
the whole idea is<font color="#E5E5E5"> we've got something</font>

338
00:15:05,510 --> 00:15:11,689
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> off-the-shelf parts</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> free</font>

339
00:15:09,290 --> 00:15:17,339
<font color="#E5E5E5">open-source</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> everything</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is ready to run</font>

340
00:15:11,690 --> 00:15:20,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">and we want to make something with it so</font>

341
00:15:17,340 --> 00:15:23,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">who wants</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to see me make something</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> yeah</font>

342
00:15:20,490 --> 00:15:30,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">alright cool so first we have to talk</font>

343
00:15:23,460 --> 00:15:31,950
about what it is<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm gonna make so yeah</font>

344
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:32,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">I hear murmuring</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I bet some people have</font>

345
00:15:31,950 --> 00:15:39,210
some guesses

346
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:43,770
so this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> garrett Elyon</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> she's one of my</font>

347
00:15:39,210 --> 00:15:45,420
big heroes and although she was

348
00:15:43,770 --> 00:15:53,939
<font color="#CCCCCC">recognized her time I still</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think she's</font>

00:15:45,420 --> 00:16:00,180
not sufficiently well song<font color="#CCCCCC"> she was in a</font>

00:16:05,790 --> 00:16:12,599
and her<font color="#CCCCCC"> PhD program came to her and said</font>

you're really working too hard<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you</font>

356
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:17,070
need to take this more seriously<font color="#E5E5E5"> and she</font>

357
00:16:14,310 --> 00:16:20,310
went oh really

358
00:16:17,070 --> 00:16:23,190
excuse me<font color="#E5E5E5"> and she dropped out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in a few</font>

these and one of them was a malarial

378
00:17:12,930 --> 00:17:20,400
pyrimethamine and so let's talk about

379
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:24,360
malaria just for a second

380
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:27,150
malaria is a parasite<font color="#E5E5E5"> right so it's a</font>

381
00:17:24,359 --> 00:17:29,790
tricky thing to kill you can't treat it

382
00:17:27,150 --> 00:17:30,730
the way you would a bacterial or even a

383
00:17:29,790 --> 00:17:32,168
viral infection

384
00:17:30,730 --> 00:17:34,240
it's a whole different thing you've got

385
00:17:32,169 --> 00:17:36,160
a microorganism in your body<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you</font>

386
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:38,020
need to find out what<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> biological</font>

387
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:41,620
mechanism is<font color="#CCCCCC"> and interrupt that somehow</font>

388
00:17:38,020 --> 00:17:43,720
without doing that to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> host body</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font>

389
00:17:41,620 --> 00:17:50,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">very tricky</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> here's another parasite</font>

390
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:54,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">this is toxoplasmosis so toxoplasmosis</font>

391
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:56,590
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's sort of got a thing about</font>

392
00:17:54,820 --> 00:18:05,710
it right it's the crazy cat lady

393
00:17:56,590 --> 00:18:07,928
<font color="#E5E5E5">infection right so it it is carried in</font>

394
00:18:05,710 --> 00:18:11,470
rodents and it reproduces in the stomach

395
00:18:07,929 --> 00:18:13,360
of cats and this is the reason why you

396
00:18:11,470 --> 00:18:14,890
always hear that pregnant women

397
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:17,889
shouldn't be changing litter boxes

he changed the price to 750 dollars per

452

453
00:20:54,250 --> 00:21:03,510
with good reason so you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> I mean</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

454
00:20:56,200 --> 00:21:08,040
so we thought let's start there

00:21:03,510 --> 00:21:08,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">thank you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> alright</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so the big question is</font>

of course

457
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:12,150
well isn't that hard<font color="#CCCCCC"> we have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to do</font>

458
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:13,260

00:21:12,150 --> 00:21:16,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">little chemistry</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">yeah don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> scared don't get scared</font>

461
00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:21,270
so for those of you who you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> dreaded</font>

00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:22,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">high school</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> campaign or so how do you</font>

463
00:21:21,270 --> 00:21:24,090
remember<font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> mole is or how to</font>

464
00:21:22,530 --> 00:21:26,010
convert units like<font color="#E5E5E5"> you don't have to</font>

465
00:21:24,090 --> 00:21:28,770
worry about all this but this is the

466
00:21:26,010 --> 00:21:31,020
original way that<font color="#E5E5E5"> pyrimethamine was</font>

467
00:21:28,770 --> 00:21:35,190
synthesized<font color="#CCCCCC"> so if you get pyrimethamine</font>

468
00:21:31,020 --> 00:21:38,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">from a lab or if you get prescribed the</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">they're doing it like this and or very</font>

471
00:21:40,650 --> 00:21:43,800
close to this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is this is a slight</font>

472
00:21:42,150 --> 00:21:45,720
adjustment<font color="#E5E5E5"> but this is the typical way</font>

473
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:47,310
that it's done and it's complicated

474
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:49,590
because they're doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> a huge batches and</font>

475
00:21:47,310 --> 00:21:53,040
you have to do all<font color="#CCCCCC"> of this stuff with</font>

476
00:21:49,590 --> 00:21:54,449
<font color="#E5E5E5">chemical engineering doing stuff on</font>

477
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:55,980
small<font color="#E5E5E5"> scales very different than doing</font>

478
00:21:54,450 --> 00:21:57,060
it on a<font color="#E5E5E5"> large scale so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's hard</font>

479
00:21:55,980 --> 00:22:02,820
and it's complicated<font color="#CCCCCC"> and there's a lot</font>

480
00:21:57,060 --> 00:22:05,460
of stuff going on so<font color="#E5E5E5"> again we turn to</font>

481
00:22:02,820 --> 00:22:10,649
our friends the computers and say help

482
00:22:05,460 --> 00:22:13,080
us with the hard work and we have some

494
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:39,330
will actually go through the last

several hundred years of chemical

for anything even remotely related to

498
00:22:45,990 --> 00:22:50,280
the reaction that you're trying to put

499
00:22:48,690 --> 00:22:52,170
together and you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> give it all manner</font>

502
00:22:55,290 --> 00:22:59,070
will put it together for you

503
00:22:56,850 --> 00:23:00,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">it's amazing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it does this amazing</font>

504
00:22:59,070 --> 00:23:02,070
combinatorial<font color="#E5E5E5"> search and then of course</font>

505
00:23:00,540 --> 00:23:03,420
there's a chemist on the other side<font color="#CCCCCC"> he's</font>

506
00:23:02,070 --> 00:23:04,889
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> taking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a look</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> saying well this</font>

507
00:23:03,420 --> 00:23:08,940
actually work as it's designed to be

508
00:23:04,890 --> 00:23:10,890
something that enhances the intuition

509
00:23:08,940 --> 00:23:13,560
rather than replacing it

510
00:23:10,890 --> 00:23:16,140
so we went to them and we said okay<font color="#E5E5E5"> we'd</font>

511
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:21,330
like a synthesis for pyrimethamine

00:23:16,140 --> 00:23:22,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's one step we don't want to do</font>

00:23:21,330 --> 00:23:24,990
three steps<font color="#E5E5E5"> we want something that's</font>

514
00:23:22,710 --> 00:23:27,540
really simple it's easy to do we want

515
00:23:24,990 --> 00:23:30,210
cheap reagents<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> wanted to be cheap and</font>

516
00:23:27,540 --> 00:23:32,159
easy<font color="#E5E5E5"> want a huge margin of error</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so it's</font>

517
00:23:30,210 --> 00:23:37,200
very hard to screw up and<font color="#CCCCCC"> we want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font>

518
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:40,170
one step and they said<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

519
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:41,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">the first one that came up with and this</font>

520
00:23:40,170 --> 00:23:44,580
is one step

521
00:23:41,370 --> 00:23:45,629
there's a problem with this reaction<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

522
00:23:44,580 --> 00:23:50,040
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is what's called the Suzuki</font>

523
00:23:45,630 --> 00:23:53,520
coupling<font color="#E5E5E5"> Suzuki coupling is where you</font>

524
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:55,139
use<font color="#E5E5E5"> a palladium catalyst now the two</font>

525
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:57,030
problems so this is this is actually a

screenshot of the program itself<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

527
00:23:57,030 --> 00:24:00,690
haven't used it but this is sort of the

528
00:23:58,470 --> 00:24:03,180
the easy interface that gives<font color="#CCCCCC"> and on the</font>

529
00:24:00,690 --> 00:24:05,040
right this is a map of where it's

530
00:24:03,180 --> 00:24:07,920
pulling<font color="#E5E5E5"> its information from</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font>

531
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:09,360
incredibly sophisticated program<font color="#E5E5E5"> so this</font>

532
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:11,790
one step<font color="#E5E5E5"> here that there are two</font>

533
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:13,469
problems one is when you use<font color="#E5E5E5"> a palladium</font>

534
00:24:11,790 --> 00:24:15,060
catalyst you end up with palladium<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

535
00:24:13,470 --> 00:24:17,670
solution and then<font color="#CCCCCC"> palladium in your end</font>

536
00:24:15,060 --> 00:24:18,929
product<font color="#CCCCCC"> palladium gives you heavy metal</font>

537
00:24:17,670 --> 00:24:21,750
poisoning

538
00:24:18,930 --> 00:24:23,460
if you have it so it's very hard to

539
00:24:21,750 --> 00:24:24,720
filter that out<font color="#CCCCCC"> and so we were like okay</font>

540
00:24:23,460 --> 00:24:26,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">we probably can't use that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> when the</font>

541
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:29,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">other problem is that one of these</font>

542
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:33,629
precursors<font color="#CCCCCC"> the one on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the bottom is like</font>

543
00:24:29,940 --> 00:24:35,010
450 years for<font color="#E5E5E5"> a gram</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we're like this</font>

544
00:24:33,630 --> 00:24:36,210
kind of defeats the purpose of trying to

545
00:24:35,010 --> 00:24:38,460
make a cheap and easy for people<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make</font>

546
00:24:36,210 --> 00:24:40,110
their own drugs<font color="#E5E5E5"> have you got something</font>

547
00:24:38,460 --> 00:24:49,050
else for<font color="#CCCCCC"> us they said okay well let's</font>

548
00:24:40,110 --> 00:24:50,429
look again<font color="#E5E5E5"> and they gave us this so if</font>

549
00:24:49,050 --> 00:24:52,169
you don't do chemistry or don't like

550
00:24:50,430 --> 00:24:53,940
chemistry you can just sort of think of

551
00:24:52,170 --> 00:24:56,520
this like a geometry problem right like

552
00:24:53,940 --> 00:24:58,560
just shapes and you can sort of see how

553
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:59,910
these pieces connect right the one with

554
00:24:58,560 --> 00:25:02,370
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> bromide sort of helps there and you</font>

555
00:24:59,910 --> 00:25:04,950
get this cute on the top with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> zigzag</font>

556
00:25:02,370 --> 00:25:07,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">right</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and then this one flips around and</font>

557
00:25:04,950 --> 00:25:12,780
attaches and you get the second ring and

558
00:25:07,770 --> 00:25:14,639
that end product is pyrimethamine all

559
00:25:12,780 --> 00:25:18,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">these precursors are commercially</font>

560
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:19,890
available<font color="#E5E5E5"> they are very cheap and this</font>

561
00:25:18,300 --> 00:25:23,100
is two steps and they're fairly simple

562
00:25:19,890 --> 00:25:23,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">ones a grignard reaction</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and the other</font>

563
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:26,520
one is a

564
00:25:23,970 --> 00:25:29,880
condensation<font color="#E5E5E5"> reaction and so essentially</font>

565
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:31,260
what you have to do is that there's

566
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:32,310
there's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> i won't get too hard into</font>

567
00:25:31,260 --> 00:25:35,010
the technical stuff you have to keep

568
00:25:32,310 --> 00:25:36,960
your lab<font color="#CCCCCC"> where dry you have to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> use the</font>

569
00:25:35,010 --> 00:25:40,140
right solvents<font color="#CCCCCC"> be careful you make this</font>

570
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:41,670
ketone here and then here<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you have</font>

571
00:25:40,140 --> 00:25:44,280
to do it slowly so things don't heat up

572
00:25:41,670 --> 00:25:47,850
to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> a nice</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> under</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> eyes and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> then you</font>

573
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:50,730
do the second one<font color="#E5E5E5"> and and this one is</font>

574
00:25:47,850 --> 00:25:58,230
fairly simple<font color="#CCCCCC"> and at the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> end you have</font>

575
00:25:50,730 --> 00:26:03,120
pyrimethamine<font color="#CCCCCC"> so yeah I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> uh</font>

576
00:25:58,230 --> 00:26:05,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's it takes a few days because when</font>

577
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:08,070
you do<font color="#E5E5E5"> your you're stirring and mixing</font>

578
00:26:05,010 --> 00:26:11,100
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> allow the reaction you have to allow</font>

579
00:26:08,070 --> 00:26:12,149
for this to go<font color="#E5E5E5"> overnight</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> each time</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

580
00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:13,919
you have to do a workup where you

581
00:26:12,150 --> 00:26:16,260
separate things out but these all are

582
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:19,080
very very simple things are very doable

583
00:26:16,260 --> 00:26:21,390
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> and all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> DM all the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> academics</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

584
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:22,649
<font color="#CCCCCC">talked to who are working on trying to</font>

585
00:26:21,390 --> 00:26:25,590
implement this in the lab<font color="#E5E5E5"> or like yeah</font>

586
00:26:22,650 --> 00:26:27,660
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is super easy so because this takes</font>

587
00:26:25,590 --> 00:26:31,110
three days<font color="#CCCCCC"> I can't do the whole thing</font>

588
00:26:27,660 --> 00:26:33,510
for you right here<font color="#E5E5E5"> but i will do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

589
00:26:31,110 --> 00:26:36,090
very last step<font color="#E5E5E5"> now the very last step of</font>

590
00:26:33,510 --> 00:26:39,480
any chemical reaction is a purification

591
00:26:36,090 --> 00:26:41,129
step because<font color="#E5E5E5"> so in this second step that</font>

592
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:43,140
you look at right<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're going to get</font>

593
00:26:41,130 --> 00:26:45,150
pyrimethamine out<font color="#E5E5E5"> but you're going to</font>

594
00:26:43,140 --> 00:26:47,850
have garbage from before<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're going to</font>

595
00:26:45,150 --> 00:26:51,510
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> unreacted components and so you</font>

596
00:26:47,850 --> 00:26:54,000
have to go through and make sure that

597
00:26:51,510 --> 00:26:55,980
you filter that out so that you don't

598
00:26:54,000 --> 00:27:02,460
have the garbage<font color="#E5E5E5"> also</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> enter</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> into your</font>

599
00:26:55,980 --> 00:27:06,870
product<font color="#E5E5E5"> so I'm going to sort of do that</font>

600
00:27:02,460 --> 00:27:09,840
here so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> gonna switch over here and</font>

601
00:27:06,870 --> 00:27:11,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">try this on so can we switch over the</font>

602
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:13,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">the document camera here and I can start</font>

603
00:27:11,820 --> 00:27:15,179
<font color="#E5E5E5">doing this and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> while that switch</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> out</font>

604
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:20,700
that was super fast

605
00:27:15,180 --> 00:27:24,540
awesome thank you<font color="#CCCCCC"> so give me just a</font>

606
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:27,990
moment here while<font color="#CCCCCC"> I switch over</font>

607
00:27:24,540 --> 00:27:33,300
<font color="#CCCCCC">I just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> need to do this so on the table</font>

608
00:27:27,990 --> 00:27:35,070
here is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> beta unit and and so you can</font>

609
00:27:33,300 --> 00:27:36,950
see it spinning up here and what it's

610
00:27:35,070 --> 00:27:40,820
doing is<font color="#CCCCCC"> its</font>

611
00:27:36,950 --> 00:27:43,549
<font color="#E5E5E5">this is the dissolving of pyrimethamine</font>

612
00:27:40,820 --> 00:27:46,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">and the unreacted components in methanol</font>

613
00:27:43,549 --> 00:27:47,870
methanol is<font color="#E5E5E5"> what alcohol it's the stuff</font>

614
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:51,590
that makes you go blind from moonshine

615
00:27:47,870 --> 00:27:52,939
<font color="#E5E5E5">right are or you know if you watched</font>

616
00:27:51,590 --> 00:27:56,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">except as a kid that's the stuff they</font>

617
00:27:52,940 --> 00:27:59,330
put<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Cardinal fast</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and and if you</font>

618
00:27:56,840 --> 00:28:01,490
can buy this is racing fuel<font color="#E5E5E5"> so it's it's</font>

619
00:27:59,330 --> 00:28:05,360
also available and you can buy from

620
00:28:01,490 --> 00:28:07,370
chemical<font color="#CCCCCC"> supply house as</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> well so the way</font>

621
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:10,340
the recrystallization purification works

622
00:28:07,370 --> 00:28:13,549
is that you heat it and then you

623
00:28:10,340 --> 00:28:16,129
saturate it with the reagents and then

624
00:28:13,549 --> 00:28:21,950
what happens is as you let it cool

625
00:28:16,130 --> 00:28:25,760
the the unreacted<font color="#CCCCCC"> components stain</font>

626
00:28:21,950 --> 00:28:28,940
solution and your product precipitates

627
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:32,179
out so looking over here<font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

628
00:28:28,940 --> 00:28:34,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">ok so here this is this is sort of the</font>

629
00:28:32,179 --> 00:28:35,990
wet stuff you can do this through a

630
00:28:34,490 --> 00:28:39,019
coffee filter this is a piece that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I got</font>

631
00:28:35,990 --> 00:28:41,570
out of like a<font color="#E5E5E5"> espresso machine and this</font>

632
00:28:39,019 --> 00:28:43,010
is what it looks like wet and then you

633
00:28:41,570 --> 00:28:44,600
have to let it dry so you can do that

634
00:28:43,010 --> 00:28:46,039
with<font color="#CCCCCC"> a vacuum pump or you know methanol</font>

635
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:48,709
has a pretty high vapor pressure you can

636
00:28:46,039 --> 00:28:51,408
just like<font color="#CCCCCC"> wait overnight and then this</font>

637
00:28:48,710 --> 00:28:54,620
magical white powder here is

638
00:28:51,409 --> 00:28:57,559
pyrimethamine<font color="#E5E5E5"> with the and so this has</font>

639
00:28:54,620 --> 00:29:01,580
been purified this is down to this is

640
00:28:57,559 --> 00:29:02,450
over<font color="#E5E5E5"> ninety-nine percent</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so how do we</font>

641
00:29:01,580 --> 00:29:04,610
put this together

642
00:29:02,450 --> 00:29:11,890
let<font color="#E5E5E5"> me just put up</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Mike over here give</font>

643
00:29:04,610 --> 00:29:20,439
me<font color="#E5E5E5"> a second</font>

644
00:29:11,890 --> 00:29:22,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> um pills of pyrimethamine</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 50</font>

645
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:25,480
milligrams<font color="#E5E5E5"> of peace and when you're</font>

646
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:27,520
treating toxoplasmosis<font color="#CCCCCC"> the first time</font>

647
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:31,330
what you do is you give a dose of 200

648
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:35,020
milligrams<font color="#E5E5E5"> right so we're gonna make a</font>

649
00:29:31,330 --> 00:29:36,370
200 milligram pill<font color="#E5E5E5"> pyrimethamine</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font>

650
00:29:35,020 --> 00:29:41,800
get my balance to turn on

651
00:29:36,370 --> 00:29:43,239
<font color="#CCCCCC">oh</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah so first let's see</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is good i</font>

652
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:44,620
can't see it<font color="#CCCCCC"> there yet</font>

653
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:47,020
<font color="#CCCCCC">alright so first thing is we're going to</font>

654
00:29:44,620 --> 00:29:50,050
put<font color="#E5E5E5"> the empty capsule on and you'll see</font>

655
00:29:47,020 --> 00:29:50,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">that that's as a little heavier than</font>

656
00:29:50,050 --> 00:29:54,010
usual

657
00:29:50,830 --> 00:29:55,480
usually it's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> tenth and I guess this</font>

658
00:29:54,010 --> 00:29:56,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">one's a little</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> heavier I'm gonna</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> try</font>

659
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:59,830
another one

have this gear here and you can look at

702
00:32:49,750 --> 00:32:52,570
you can even come over and use it

00:32:51,490 --> 00:32:54,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if you need to you can ask</font>

00:32:52,570 --> 00:32:59,320

<font color="#CCCCCC">so let's just talk about Martin a little</font>

707
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:11,680
on the guy right because the<font color="#E5E5E5"> all the</font>

708
00:33:06,790 --> 00:33:14,620
reasons we know<font color="#CCCCCC"> um</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but I think it's</font>

709
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:15,700
worth considering<font color="#CCCCCC"> maybe giving him the</font>

710
00:33:14,620 --> 00:33:19,719
benefit of the doubt

711
00:33:15,700 --> 00:33:21,940
now what<font color="#E5E5E5"> what was claimed by the FBI in</font>

712
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:23,890
his indictment and<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you know what</font>

713
00:33:21,940 --> 00:33:25,690
most people sort of assume that he had a

714
00:33:23,890 --> 00:33:28,660
hedge fund<font color="#CCCCCC"> any</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of ran it into the</font>

715
00:33:25,690 --> 00:33:31,000
ground and then lied to his investors

716
00:33:28,660 --> 00:33:32,950
saying<font color="#CCCCCC"> is doing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> fine and then jacked up</font>

717
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:35,140
the price of daraprim so he could<font color="#E5E5E5"> cream</font>

718
00:33:32,950 --> 00:33:36,910
off some extra money to pay back his

719
00:33:35,140 --> 00:33:38,260
investors to be like everything's fine

720
00:33:36,910 --> 00:33:39,520
everything's fine<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm going to turn</font>

721
00:33:38,260 --> 00:33:42,370
around next quarter and then they'll

722
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:45,070
never know

723
00:33:42,370 --> 00:33:48,159
<font color="#E5E5E5">his</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> story is a little different he</font>

724
00:33:45,070 --> 00:33:50,980
suggests that none of that happens and

725
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:52,990
he had a really good reason for jacking

726
00:33:50,980 --> 00:33:55,600
up the price now he suggests that the

727
00:33:52,990 --> 00:33:59,890
reason that it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> unacceptable to</font>

728
00:33:55,600 --> 00:34:02,949
raise the price of<font color="#E5E5E5"> drug 5,000% is</font>

729
00:33:59,890 --> 00:34:04,630
because they were<font color="#CCCCCC"> shuttling a bunch of</font>

730
00:34:02,950 --> 00:34:07,120
money to R&D and they wanted to develop

731
00:34:04,630 --> 00:34:11,919
a new<font color="#CCCCCC"> toxoplasma struck again power</font>

732
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:15,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">method means the only one out there so</font>

733
00:34:11,918 --> 00:34:17,138
<font color="#CCCCCC">and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's fairly toxic</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> there</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they're</font>

734
00:34:15,370 --> 00:34:18,668
pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> bad side effects when you take it</font>

735
00:34:17,139 --> 00:34:21,940
and he wanted to develop something new

736
00:34:18,668 --> 00:34:23,679
so maybe he's really into it maybe he's

737
00:34:21,940 --> 00:34:25,300
really into it so I don't know right

738
00:34:23,679 --> 00:34:26,770
maybe he really is this<font color="#CCCCCC"> alturas and</font>

739
00:34:25,300 --> 00:34:30,310
we're all just being too hard on<font color="#E5E5E5"> him so</font>

743
00:34:34,449 --> 00:34:39,339
maybe instead of being like our

744
00:34:37,389 --> 00:34:40,450
arch-nemesis<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe partner with us on</font>

745
00:34:39,340 --> 00:34:41,770

904
00:42:39,330 --> 00:42:43,860
common question is this one and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I know</font>

905
00:42:42,300 --> 00:42:45,680
like some portion of<font color="#CCCCCC"> your</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like yeah</font>

906
00:42:43,860 --> 00:42:51,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's really scaring some of your like</font>

907
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:52,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">and um the answers like not really</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font>

908
00:42:51,740 --> 00:42:55,220
that there are two reasons for this

909
00:42:52,910 --> 00:42:58,370
first of all this only<font color="#E5E5E5"> works in really</font>

910
00:42:55,220 --> 00:43:00,919
small batches<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> if you</font>

911
00:42:58,370 --> 00:43:03,799
really wanted to make some opiates<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

912
00:43:00,920 --> 00:43:06,050
maybe could but you wouldn't be making

913
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:07,580
very many<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it wouldn't be worth the</font>

914
00:43:06,050 --> 00:43:09,080
trouble of building the whole apparatus

915
00:43:07,580 --> 00:43:11,090
to just do that

916
00:43:09,080 --> 00:43:13,580
not some mention if you ever read a book

917
00:43:11,090 --> 00:43:15,920
about how<font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> manufacture narcotics</font>

918
00:43:13,580 --> 00:43:17,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">it's way easier than building all this</font>

922
00:43:23,060 --> 00:43:28,580
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I get from concerned people is this</font>

923
00:43:25,490 --> 00:43:31,310
right<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're all very concerned about all</font>

the<font color="#CCCCCC"> antibiotic-resistant strains of</font>

932
00:43:48,230 --> 00:43:51,740
very very nasty<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing that a lot of</font>

people<font color="#CCCCCC"> die from</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and I didn't but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> lost</font>

935
00:43:55,670 --> 00:43:59,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">worth saying well what happens if people</font>

936
00:43:57,710 --> 00:44:02,750
make medications and they take them

937
00:43:59,120 --> 00:44:05,660
recklessly<font color="#CCCCCC"> well that's a danger</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but it's</font>

938
00:44:02,750 --> 00:44:07,970
not super likely<font color="#E5E5E5"> rate because if</font>

939
00:44:05,660 --> 00:44:10,490
somebody has at least at this juncture

940
00:44:07,970 --> 00:44:12,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">the wherewithal</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the forethought to</font>

941
00:44:10,490 --> 00:44:13,339
make something this technical because

942
00:44:12,200 --> 00:44:14,660
they feel it's important for them to

943
00:44:13,340 --> 00:44:16,040
make their own medications it's really

944
00:44:14,660 --> 00:44:16,970
unlikely<font color="#CCCCCC"> then</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just going to take them</font>

945
00:44:16,040 --> 00:44:20,150
wrong

946
00:44:16,970 --> 00:44:22,490
so again yes of course it's a danger but

947
00:44:20,150 --> 00:44:25,370
as<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think we all agree</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> better to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

948
00:44:22,490 --> 00:44:27,350
information tools out there than not and

949
00:44:25,370 --> 00:44:30,230
it will do more good than harm

950
00:44:27,350 --> 00:44:31,009
so this is the next one that we get all

951
00:44:30,230 --> 00:44:34,250
the time

952
00:44:31,010 --> 00:44:36,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">Oh chemistry is hard</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> right yeah</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> isn't</font>

953
00:44:34,250 --> 00:44:38,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">there the story of like some drugs that</font>

954
00:44:36,470 --> 00:44:39,560
got out that<font color="#E5E5E5"> were bad because somebody</font>

955
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:44,660
just made a little mistake

956
00:44:39,560 --> 00:44:47,630
well<font color="#CCCCCC"> um yes</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> right but avoiding this is</font>

957
00:44:44,660 --> 00:44:50,990
the whole premise<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the reason that we</font>

958
00:44:47,630 --> 00:44:53,540
work with cim<font color="#CCCCCC"> Attica so closely</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is that</font>

959
00:44:50,990 --> 00:44:56,330
we're trying to make reactions that are

960
00:44:53,540 --> 00:44:57,359
foolproof<font color="#CCCCCC"> there</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are reactions out there</font>

961
00:44:56,330 --> 00:45:01,170
were yet

962
00:44:57,359 --> 00:45:02,489
temperature varies a little bit then all

963
00:45:01,170 --> 00:45:04,170
of a sudden<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's horribly toxic there</font>

964
00:45:02,489 --> 00:45:06,749
was a really tragic story of some guy

965
00:45:04,170 --> 00:45:08,819
who was cooking<font color="#CCCCCC"> I don't know meth or</font>

966
00:45:06,749 --> 00:45:12,209
<font color="#E5E5E5">ecstasy something like that and he made</font>

967
00:45:08,819 --> 00:45:13,769
a small mistake by a few degrees and<font color="#E5E5E5"> end</font>

968
00:45:12,210 --> 00:45:16,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">up producing this horribly toxic thing</font>

969
00:45:13,769 --> 00:45:18,988
<font color="#CCCCCC">and a whole bunch of addicts</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> went</font>

970
00:45:16,170 --> 00:45:21,029
catatonic<font color="#E5E5E5"> like just right</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> box and</font>

971
00:45:18,989 --> 00:45:23,460
yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's scary and it's important and</font>

972
00:45:21,029 --> 00:45:25,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">so the reason that we put so much work</font>

973
00:45:23,460 --> 00:45:28,230
into research into this is to avoid that

974
00:45:25,950 --> 00:45:30,149
very problem<font color="#CCCCCC"> one of the parameters that</font>

975
00:45:28,230 --> 00:45:34,920
we put into the computer is make sure

976
00:45:30,150 --> 00:45:40,440
that there is all<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of room for error</font>

977
00:45:34,920 --> 00:45:42,569
in temperature and time and control<font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font>

978
00:45:40,440 --> 00:45:46,140
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is another one</font>

979
00:45:42,569 --> 00:45:49,349
isn't this illegal<font color="#E5E5E5"> but no it is in</font>

980
00:45:46,140 --> 00:45:51,089
violation of<font color="#CCCCCC"> patents sometimes</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and of</font>

981
00:45:49,349 --> 00:45:52,739
course sometimes<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> there are</font>

982
00:45:51,089 --> 00:45:54,299
ways to get around that and there are

983
00:45:52,739 --> 00:45:55,650
some people as well yes you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're</font>

984
00:45:54,299 --> 00:45:57,480
practicing medicine without a license

985
00:45:55,650 --> 00:45:58,470
but yes here in the state of<font color="#E5E5E5"> New York</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> if</font>

986
00:45:57,480 --> 00:46:00,119
somebody says you have a headache and

987
00:45:58,470 --> 00:46:01,680
you say<font color="#CCCCCC"> without taking</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ask for that</font>

988
00:46:00,119 --> 00:46:04,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">that's practicing medicine without a</font>

989
00:46:01,680 --> 00:46:09,118
license so seriously

990
00:46:04,470 --> 00:46:10,348
um but<font color="#E5E5E5"> um</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> yeah</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's possible so yeah</font>

991
00:46:09,119 --> 00:46:13,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">I'll take</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

992
00:46:10,349 --> 00:46:15,150
that said if any of your lawyers<font color="#E5E5E5"> or no</font>

993
00:46:13,380 --> 00:46:17,940
lawyers like<font color="#E5E5E5"> please come talk to me</font>

994
00:46:15,150 --> 00:46:19,850
because i'm expecting to be sued<font color="#E5E5E5"> like by</font>

noon

996

<font color="#E5E5E5">and this next question was the first</font>

997
00:46:24,620 --> 00:46:30,020
thing that was asked to me by the head

998

00:47:31,760 --> 00:47:39,620
the project<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you believe as we believe</font>

1020
00:47:34,880 --> 00:47:42,590
that the freedom of sharing ideas should

1021
00:47:39,620 --> 00:47:43,430
include the freedom to manage your own

1022
00:47:42,590 --> 00:47:47,210
health

1023
00:47:43,430 --> 00:47:58,549
please come<font color="#E5E5E5"> join us</font>

00:47:58,550 --> 00:48:05,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">so it looks like we have about four and</font>

1026
00:48:03,230 --> 00:48:07,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">a half minutes for questions</font>

1027
00:48:05,030 --> 00:48:23,030
<font color="#CCCCCC">I can't really see if there's a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> yes sir</font>

1028
00:48:07,610 --> 00:48:26,090
<font color="#CCCCCC">thank you</font>

1029
00:48:23,030 --> 00:48:27,800
right yes sir

1030
00:48:26,090 --> 00:48:29,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">so this is a very good question for</font>

1031
00:48:27,800 --> 00:48:32,270
those of you who didn't hear he's asking

1032
00:48:29,810 --> 00:48:34,640
about what's called stereochemistry<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

1033
00:48:32,270 --> 00:48:38,450
in many cases you have complicated

1034
00:48:34,640 --> 00:48:40,250
molecules that like you are not the same

1035
00:48:38,450 --> 00:48:41,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">the left-handed version and the</font>

1036
00:48:40,250 --> 00:48:44,150
right-handed version you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can't turn them</font>

1037
00:48:41,720 --> 00:48:46,520
into each other and so looking back at

1038
00:48:44,150 --> 00:48:49,520
the molecules<font color="#E5E5E5"> here</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a great</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> example of</font>

1039
00:48:46,520 --> 00:48:50,900
that is GSK 744<font color="#CCCCCC"> this has two</font>

1040
00:48:49,520 --> 00:48:52,250
stereocenters and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm starting to get</font>

1041
00:48:50,900 --> 00:48:54,770
like super technical<font color="#CCCCCC"> and everybody but</font>

1042
00:48:52,250 --> 00:48:56,390
this has<font color="#CCCCCC"> two stereocenters</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you see these</font>

1043
00:48:54,770 --> 00:48:58,610
places where things stick together like

1044
00:48:56,390 --> 00:49:02,060
this and they can be this way or this

1045
00:48:58,610 --> 00:49:04,160
way and it's different<font color="#CCCCCC"> so that is a very</font>

1046
00:49:02,060 --> 00:49:10,310
tricky thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> now for this in particular</font>

1047
00:49:04,160 --> 00:49:16,730
we have a synthesis that<font color="#CCCCCC"> favors</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

1048
00:49:10,310 --> 00:49:19,070
particular handedness<font color="#CCCCCC"> by 85%</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and then</font>

1049
00:49:16,730 --> 00:49:22,490
you can filter out the others<font color="#CCCCCC"> so yeah it</font>

1050
00:49:19,070 --> 00:49:24,860
is a problem<font color="#CCCCCC"> it is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a problem and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> um</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font>

1051
00:49:22,490 --> 00:49:29,569
so again looking some of these do not so

1052
00:49:24,860 --> 00:49:31,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">um pyrimethamine are our favorite here</font>

1053
00:49:29,570 --> 00:49:34,310
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a very</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> simple molecules you can see</font>

1054
00:49:31,280 --> 00:49:36,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's small and it's flat</font>

1055
00:49:34,310 --> 00:49:39,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">I mean it's not really flat but what it</font>

1056
00:49:36,140 --> 00:49:44,480
is is you see that it has its connection

1057
00:49:39,830 --> 00:49:46,069
points are all on<font color="#CCCCCC"> they all spin right</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

1058
00:49:44,480 --> 00:49:47,840
there's nothing<font color="#E5E5E5"> rigid here right you</font>

1059
00:49:46,070 --> 00:49:49,850
have these two rings and everything else

1060
00:49:47,840 --> 00:49:52,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">just rotates freely if you imagine those</font>

1061
00:49:49,850 --> 00:49:54,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">is being like rotating joints so yeah</font>

1062
00:49:52,640 --> 00:49:55,790
really good question and it is and it is

1063
00:49:54,410 --> 00:49:58,220
a problem and it is something that we

1064
00:49:55,790 --> 00:50:01,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">spend a lot of time and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Connecticut is</font>

1065
00:49:58,220 --> 00:50:02,720
notoriously hot for being able to get

1066
00:50:01,460 --> 00:50:04,670
<font color="#CCCCCC">syntheses that work well as</font>

1067
00:50:02,720 --> 00:50:07,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">stereochemistry</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and mind you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1068
00:50:04,670 --> 00:50:09,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">eighty-five percent</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> figure that I just</font>

1069
00:50:07,580 --> 00:50:10,880
quoted you is before chemical<font color="#E5E5E5"> kinetics</font>

1070
00:50:09,830 --> 00:50:12,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">even</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> their</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> hair</font>

1071
00:50:10,880 --> 00:50:14,660
hands on it<font color="#E5E5E5"> so they're probably going to</font>

1072
00:50:12,680 --> 00:50:17,930
be able to reduce that by an order of

1073
00:50:14,660 --> 00:50:31,819
magnitude<font color="#CCCCCC"> so yeah</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> thank you</font>

1074
00:50:17,930 --> 00:50:33,230
who else over here<font color="#E5E5E5"> right this is a great</font>

1075
00:50:31,819 --> 00:50:36,349
question that<font color="#CCCCCC"> i get a lot too so</font>

1076
00:50:33,230 --> 00:50:37,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">typically in in normal chemistry</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> what</font>

1077
00:50:36,349 --> 00:50:40,130
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> end up doing is you sort of like you</font>

1078
00:50:37,880 --> 00:50:42,079
make a mess in the lab and then you do a

1079
00:50:40,130 --> 00:50:44,599
lot of filtration and a lot of

1080
00:50:42,079 --> 00:50:46,670
analytical methods<font color="#E5E5E5"> right</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> where what you</font>

1081
00:50:44,599 --> 00:50:49,009
do is you you know you<font color="#E5E5E5"> you do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> gas</font>

1082
00:50:46,670 --> 00:50:51,769
<font color="#CCCCCC">chromatography and you do spectroscopy</font>

1083
00:50:49,009 --> 00:50:54,950
and you do nuclear magnetic resonance

1084
00:50:51,769 --> 00:50:56,899
imaging<font color="#E5E5E5"> all of those things are fairly</font>

1085
00:50:54,950 --> 00:50:59,149
hard and fairly expensive with the

1086
00:50:56,900 --> 00:51:01,220
exception of thin-film chromatography

1087
00:50:59,150 --> 00:51:05,630
which is fairly easy and can do<font color="#E5E5E5"> at home</font>

1088
00:51:01,220 --> 00:51:08,299
<font color="#E5E5E5">and it's super cheap</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so again</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there are</font>

1089
00:51:05,630 --> 00:51:12,349
two things one is<font color="#E5E5E5"> we've worked very very</font>

1090
00:51:08,299 --> 00:51:15,500
hard to<font color="#E5E5E5"> front-load the work that the</font>

1091
00:51:12,349 --> 00:51:18,349
synthesis that we use and the syntheses

1092
00:51:15,500 --> 00:51:21,650
that we use are different genuinely<font color="#E5E5E5"> than</font>

1093
00:51:18,349 --> 00:51:23,089
the old<font color="#E5E5E5"> ones specifically so that you</font>

1094
00:51:21,650 --> 00:51:25,430
don't have to have all that

1095
00:51:23,089 --> 00:51:27,078
sophisticated equipment to test<font color="#CCCCCC"> but you</font>

1096
00:51:25,430 --> 00:51:29,569
can also use<font color="#CCCCCC"> a thin layer</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> chromatography</font>

1097
00:51:27,079 --> 00:51:33,559
and you should be able to determine that

1098
00:51:29,569 --> 00:51:35,210
you don't have other stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> so so yeah</font>

1099
00:51:33,559 --> 00:51:37,069
that is that is something worth worth

1100
00:51:35,210 --> 00:51:39,200
thinking about and it is important<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

1101
00:51:37,069 --> 00:51:41,299
again this is the reason why we work so

1102
00:51:39,200 --> 00:51:42,558
hard with the<font color="#CCCCCC"> the computational chemist</font>

1103
00:51:41,299 --> 00:51:43,849
to make sure that works<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think i may</font>

1104
00:51:42,559 --> 00:51:49,460
have time for one more

1105
00:51:43,849 --> 00:51:53,619
yes over here<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm sorry you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> got to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

1106
00:51:49,460 --> 00:52:05,079
speak<font color="#CCCCCC"> of Alura</font>

1107
00:51:53,619 --> 00:52:06,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that's another thing that comes up</font>

1108
00:52:05,079 --> 00:52:08,140
right<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> aren't you going to</font>

1109
00:52:06,400 --> 00:52:09,730
destroy the pharmaceutical industry like

1110
00:52:08,140 --> 00:52:12,339
nobody will ever buy another drug<font color="#E5E5E5"> again</font>

1111
00:52:09,730 --> 00:52:14,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">I kinda doubt it like I mean if that</font>

1112
00:52:12,339 --> 00:52:17,410
happens<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'll kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of like saying happy</font>

1113
00:52:14,470 --> 00:52:21,098
dance but like<font color="#E5E5E5"> um but really the thing</font>

1114
00:52:17,410 --> 00:52:25,029
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> is that we're not trying to supplant</font>

1115
00:52:21,099 --> 00:52:27,910
the pharmaceutical industry<font color="#E5E5E5"> right if if</font>

1116
00:52:25,029 --> 00:52:30,640
you have insurance<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you can go get</font>

1117
00:52:27,910 --> 00:52:31,509
toxoplasmosis from<font color="#CCCCCC"> the dispensary go do</font>

1118
00:52:30,640 --> 00:52:34,629
that

1119
00:52:31,509 --> 00:52:36,609
<font color="#E5E5E5">I mean</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> jeez but this is trying to fill a</font>

1120
00:52:34,630 --> 00:52:38,859
very small gap and again like<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's</font>

1121
00:52:36,609 --> 00:52:40,839
<font color="#CCCCCC">healthcare</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is a huge spectrum of things</font>

1122
00:52:38,859 --> 00:52:42,970
but there's just a small little step

1123
00:52:40,839 --> 00:52:44,470
like if you have everything else going

1124
00:52:42,970 --> 00:52:47,680
on but<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you know the thing that you</font>

1125
00:52:44,470 --> 00:52:49,118
need and you can't get it<font color="#CCCCCC"> you should</font>

1126
00:52:47,680 --> 00:52:50,529
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a way to take it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in your own hands</font>

1127
00:52:49,119 --> 00:52:52,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">and this is a jump</font>

1128
00:52:50,529 --> 00:52:54,430
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah um but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think that it's</font>

1129
00:52:52,960 --> 00:52:56,440
going to be something<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're all of a</font>

1130
00:52:54,430 --> 00:52:58,390
sudden it just makes<font color="#E5E5E5"> research collapse</font>

1131
00:52:56,440 --> 00:53:01,119
because seriously as you said it's

1132
00:52:58,390 --> 00:53:02,799
terribly toxic<font color="#E5E5E5"> like this is not a great</font>

1133
00:53:01,119 --> 00:53:06,609
drug<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's just the only one that's out</font>

1134
00:53:02,799 --> 00:53:08,980
there<font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really you know we should be</font>

1135
00:53:06,609 --> 00:53:10,989
doing research and if a doctor came to

1136
00:53:08,980 --> 00:53:12,670
me and said well you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> go home and you</font>

1137
00:53:10,989 --> 00:53:17,079
can make yourself you know

1138
00:53:12,670 --> 00:53:18,970
pyrimethamine<font color="#E5E5E5"> or you could</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> instead by</font>

1139
00:53:17,079 --> 00:53:21,549
this new drug that doesn't make you like

1140
00:53:18,970 --> 00:53:23,379
nauseous and dizzy and made<font color="#E5E5E5"> make you go</font>

1141
00:53:21,549 --> 00:53:25,269
into convulsions and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I get the better</font>

1142
00:53:23,380 --> 00:53:26,859
one<font color="#CCCCCC"> but yeah that's a that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that's an</font>

1143
00:53:25,269 --> 00:53:28,629
important point on infrastructure level

1144
00:53:26,859 --> 00:53:31,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's it's it's something we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

1145
00:53:28,630 --> 00:53:33,220
a lot and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think I think that might be</font>

1146
00:53:31,660 --> 00:53:47,879
<font color="#CCCCCC">this is is there one more going to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> take</font>

1147
00:53:33,220 --> 00:53:50,939
<font color="#CCCCCC">mine</font>

1148
00:53:47,880 --> 00:53:54,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">oh right</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> yes so right so about the</font>

1149
00:53:50,940 --> 00:53:56,339
<font color="#E5E5E5">details so again it's a pretty</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> were sort</font>

1150
00:53:54,720 --> 00:53:58,169
of an alpha stage<font color="#E5E5E5"> when you do the</font>

1151
00:53:56,339 --> 00:54:00,029
download that<font color="#E5E5E5"> there is supporting</font>

1152
00:53:58,170 --> 00:54:02,640
literature<font color="#CCCCCC"> there are research papers</font>

1153
00:54:00,029 --> 00:54:05,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">there's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the code for the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> arduino micro</font>

1154
00:54:02,640 --> 00:54:06,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">there's the files for printing all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

1155
00:54:05,250 --> 00:54:08,460
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> you kind of have to hack it</font>

1156
00:54:06,960 --> 00:54:10,769
together yourself because<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's at this</font>

1157
00:54:08,460 --> 00:54:13,500
preliminary stage but yes all of that

1158
00:54:10,769 --> 00:54:14,459
<font color="#E5E5E5">where you can order it from</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> how much it</font>

1159
00:54:13,500 --> 00:54:17,339
costs

1160
00:54:14,460 --> 00:54:19,170
all that is<font color="#E5E5E5"> outline so yeah so thank you</font>

1161
00:54:17,339 --> 00:54:20,970
thank you again all so much for coming

1162
00:54:19,170 --> 00:54:21,359
if you have other questions<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll be over</font>

1163
00:54:20,970 --> 00:54:22,240
here

1164
00:54:21,359 --> 00:54:34,819
thank you so much
