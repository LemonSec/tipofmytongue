um so you can see we're kind of all part

58
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:26,129
of one community in that we all kind of

59
00:02:24,269 --> 00:02:28,590
know that<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's an</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> internet and</font>

60
00:02:26,129 --> 00:02:30,420
there's a thing out there and we can

61
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:33,629
connect to people through it which is

62
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:35,010
wonderful that community knows what the

63
00:02:33,629 --> 00:02:36,659
internet is and that's a really good

64
00:02:35,010 --> 00:02:39,599
start for this talk today that's kind of

65
00:02:36,659 --> 00:02:41,519
the base of knowledge that you need when

66
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:43,828
you interact with people on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> internet</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">they should be protected by encryption</font>

71

so encryption and<font color="#E5E5E5"> its simplest most</font>

82
00:03:14,099 --> 00:03:17,280
do a little review and then we're going

00:03:15,329 --> 00:03:20,639
to get into into kind of the heart of

what this goes the<font color="#CCCCCC"> lowest-cost</font>

you for that conversation here in the

872
00:32:55,620 --> 00:33:01,199
tomorrow morning<font color="#E5E5E5"> about that stuff right</font>

873
00:32:58,620 --> 00:33:03,539
<font color="#E5E5E5">I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> love that question</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> because in two</font>

00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:05,490
weeks actually access now<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hoping two</font>

875
00:33:03,539 --> 00:33:07,350
or three weeks to put out a report on

876
00:33:05,490 --> 00:33:09,480
government hacking and specifically its

877
00:33:07,350 --> 00:33:12,178
interaction with human rights and how it

878
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:14,100
if it complies with human rights law and

879
00:33:12,179 --> 00:33:15,630
standards around the world<font color="#CCCCCC"> so we're</font>

880
00:33:14,100 --> 00:33:17,699
basically right now digging<font color="#E5E5E5"> into that</font>

881
00:33:15,630 --> 00:33:19,740
question<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that that is really</font>

882
00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:21,899
a preliminary question is government

883
00:33:19,740 --> 00:33:24,600
hacking even possible in line with

884
00:33:21,899 --> 00:33:28,199
international law<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I think the answer</font>

885
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:32,789
like spoiler<font color="#E5E5E5"> on its most of the times</font>

886
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:35,639
know and maybe in some cases but there

887
00:33:32,789 --> 00:33:37,559
have to be extreme safeguards including

888
00:33:35,639 --> 00:33:40,529
a lot of transparency and accountability

889
00:33:37,559 --> 00:33:41,668
measures put into place<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i think we</font>

890
00:33:40,529 --> 00:33:44,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">need</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to start with when it should be</font>

891
00:33:41,669 --> 00:33:46,889
banned outright<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then talk about how</font>

892
00:33:44,700 --> 00:33:49,470
extreme the safeguards can be on the

<font color="#CCCCCC">backend</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i'll</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just add very quickly</font>

00:33:49,470 --> 00:33:53,639
before<font color="#CCCCCC"> you ask your</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> fault</font>

895
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:57,029
<font color="#E5E5E5">where's encryption there's some</font>

00:33:53,639 --> 00:33:58,350
established<font color="#E5E5E5"> body of a long maybe or some</font>

policy on point

898
00:33:58,350 --> 00:34:03,689
<font color="#E5E5E5">uh hacking there's significantly less so</font>

899
00:34:01,230 --> 00:34:05,159
<font color="#CCCCCC">so it requires some creativity thinking</font>

900
00:34:03,690 --> 00:34:06,809
about that what is how it's actually

901

just came out yesterday about a

of follows a similar line of inquiry

926
00:34:50,369 --> 00:34:55,619
where it seems like sometimes<font color="#E5E5E5"> government</font>

00:34:53,248 --> 00:34:57,660
operatives<font color="#E5E5E5"> ask for things they don't</font>

928
00:34:55,619 --> 00:35:00,210
have the authority to ask for because

929
00:34:57,660 --> 00:35:01,348
you can always ask<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm assuming people</font>

will think they have<font color="#E5E5E5"> the authority to</font>

ask for<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> then they'll give it to</font>

them

00:37:54,410 --> 00:37:58,129
so you know that that's one of the

1010
00:37:56,990 --> 00:37:59,240
things that we certainly have argued

<font color="#CCCCCC">that if you're if you're talking about</font>

and certainly one of the arguments being

1035

made in DC is that this is going to kill

likely to impact is there is currently a

1049
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:41,550
proposal that we just got draft language

1050
00:39:38,370 --> 00:39:44,100
on a week ago<font color="#E5E5E5"> Friday evening at about</font>

1051
00:39:41,550 --> 00:39:45,120
7pm<font color="#E5E5E5"> because that's when</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> DOJ drops things</font>

1052
00:39:44,100 --> 00:39:49,680
that they don't really want you to pay

1053
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:53,700
attention to<font color="#CCCCCC"> where the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> UK once direct</font>

1054
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:55,020
access under its own laws to<font color="#E5E5E5"> wiretap</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

1055
00:39:53,700 --> 00:39:57,089
<font color="#CCCCCC">to go to companies in the United States</font>

1056
00:39:55,020 --> 00:40:00,930
and get data and it requires a change of

1057
00:39:57,090 --> 00:40:04,590
US law<font color="#CCCCCC"> will</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be in the UK legal standards</font>

1058
00:40:00,930 --> 00:40:07,740
and so unfortunately the UK which

1059
00:40:04,590 --> 00:40:10,410
already has very<font color="#CCCCCC"> lacks</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> standards for</font>

1060
00:40:07,740 --> 00:40:12,600
access to data are making those

1061
00:40:10,410 --> 00:40:14,970
standards even worse<font color="#CCCCCC"> than a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of cases</font>

1062
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:18,660
um there are<font color="#CCCCCC"> running encryption back</font>

1063
00:40:14,970 --> 00:40:20,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">doors</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they want to allow bulk hacking I</font>

00:40:18,660 --> 00:40:21,960
don't even know what bulk<font color="#CCCCCC"> hacking would</font>

1065
00:40:20,220 --> 00:40:23,580
mean because they're hacking already

<font color="#E5E5E5">like their regular hacking provisions</font>

1068
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:28,950

00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:36,030
is the proposal that I'm hoping will

<font color="#E5E5E5">especially now that the UK isn't part of</font>

1088
00:41:18,049 --> 00:41:23,000
we need to do is add a small cost to the

a proposed solution i'm curious your

we point to a lot of different solutions

1203
00:45:44,120 --> 00:45:49,790
there's also<font color="#CCCCCC"> street</font>

1205
00:45:49,790 --> 00:45:52,340
then people in this room<font color="#CCCCCC"> I know that</font>

1206
00:45:51,350 --> 00:45:53,210
you're out there and you're all gonna

kill me

1213
00:46:05,720 --> 00:46:08,810
have a lot of tools there as well so you

can look at the<font color="#CCCCCC"> toolkits that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

00:46:44,450 --> 00:46:47,839
basically this presentation today the

1231
00:46:47,210 --> 00:46:51,680
floor

1232
00:46:47,840 --> 00:46:52,580
I'm just<font color="#E5E5E5"> nothing like it in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can you</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">that they've</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with that degree i'll say</font>

1238
00:47:02,630 --> 00:47:06,800
requirements<font color="#E5E5E5"> and therefore</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> come telcos</font>

1239
00:47:05,180 --> 00:47:07,850
to take security measures right so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

1240
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:11,700
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> encryption is part of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

1241
00:47:07,850 --> 00:47:19,078
would be great

1242

<font color="#CCCCCC">yeah</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if you're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> going to be around after</font>

1243
00:47:19,079 --> 00:47:23,970

great hey<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't hi</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> had a couple</font>

1247
00:47:31,950 --> 00:47:35,848
<font color="#E5E5E5">questions special comments and one of</font>

1248
00:47:34,619 --> 00:47:38,400
the things<font color="#CCCCCC"> I've never</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> heard</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of here</font>

1249
00:47:35,849 --> 00:47:40,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">organization prior to this but one of</font>

1250
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:44,640
the things<font color="#CCCCCC"> I didn't hear you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about</font>

1251
00:47:40,380 --> 00:47:47,520
it is do you in your work address the

1252
00:47:44,640 --> 00:47:49,680
illusion of security propagated by

1253
00:47:47,520 --> 00:47:51,390
algorithms that aren't being updated in

1254
00:47:49,680 --> 00:47:54,720
proportion to the increase in computing

1255
00:47:51,390 --> 00:47:57,000
power<font color="#E5E5E5"> because some of this stuff is like</font>

1256
00:47:54,720 --> 00:47:58,140
the equivalent of<font color="#CCCCCC"> seatbelts made out of</font>

1257
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:59,970
toilet paper

1258
00:47:58,140 --> 00:48:04,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">I mean like you talk about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> TLS for</font>

1259
00:47:59,970 --> 00:48:06,660
example<font color="#E5E5E5"> and yeah they're still using RSA</font>

1260
00:48:04,410 --> 00:48:09,390
keys that aren't the same strength as

1261
00:48:06,660 --> 00:48:12,868
the underlying encryption<font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I guess</font>

1262
00:48:09,390 --> 00:48:14,069
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> would</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be my first question</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't</font>

1263
00:48:12,869 --> 00:48:15,839
know if you want me<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you want to</font>

1264
00:48:14,070 --> 00:48:17,280
answer<font color="#E5E5E5"> then asking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> honored</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you want me</font>

1265
00:48:15,839 --> 00:48:20,430
to give you all<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ones</font>

1266
00:48:17,280 --> 00:48:21,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">um how many are there just do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ok</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> let's</font>

1267
00:48:20,430 --> 00:48:24,450
do one at a time

1268
00:48:21,540 --> 00:48:26,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">uh</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so we definitely look at these from</font>

1269
00:48:24,450 --> 00:48:28,560
like that snake oil<font color="#CCCCCC"> salesman perspective</font>

1270
00:48:26,700 --> 00:48:30,660
<font color="#CCCCCC">and that a lot of apps that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> came out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

1271
00:48:28,560 --> 00:48:33,150
just awful

1272
00:48:30,660 --> 00:48:34,560
<font color="#CCCCCC">um</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and they try to tell exactly</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> what you</font>

1273
00:48:33,150 --> 00:48:37,349
said<font color="#E5E5E5"> the illusion of security but with</font>

1274
00:48:34,560 --> 00:48:38,790
no security at all<font color="#CCCCCC"> so we do analyze it</font>

1275
00:48:37,349 --> 00:48:43,170
from that perspective<font color="#E5E5E5"> from the other</font>

1276
00:48:38,790 --> 00:48:45,000
side<font color="#CCCCCC"> of it we tend to support free and</font>

1277
00:48:43,170 --> 00:48:46,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">open source software so that it can be</font>

1278
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:49,410
audited so that people can actually look

1279
00:48:46,530 --> 00:48:52,260
at it and<font color="#CCCCCC"> know how securities and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that's</font>

1280
00:48:49,410 --> 00:48:54,299
our preference<font color="#CCCCCC"> we have a tech team</font>

1281
00:48:52,260 --> 00:48:55,890
that's fairly robust<font color="#CCCCCC"> that operates from</font>

1282
00:48:54,300 --> 00:48:58,109
the three offices that we had up on the

1283
00:48:55,890 --> 00:48:59,700
screen as well as from a few other

1284
00:48:58,109 --> 00:49:02,520
locations that delves into this

1285
00:48:59,700 --> 00:49:04,140
technology so we are testing it<font color="#CCCCCC"> drew and</font>

1286
00:49:02,520 --> 00:49:06,750
I are definitely not testing at<font color="#CCCCCC"> norwood</font>

1287
00:49:04,140 --> 00:49:09,240
you want us to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> uh because that would</font>

1288
00:49:06,750 --> 00:49:10,829
go horribly<font color="#E5E5E5"> but it is something that we</font>

1289
00:49:09,240 --> 00:49:13,950
are aware of and that we definitely like

1290
00:49:10,829 --> 00:49:16,869
<font color="#CCCCCC">I hear</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about all the time and my other</font>

1291
00:49:13,950 --> 00:49:19,720
question was just your thoughts on

1292
00:49:16,869 --> 00:49:22,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">but the point is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> or the rationale is</font>

1293
00:49:19,720 --> 00:49:24,970
built<font color="#CCCCCC"> an authorized</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> back doors</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> clear</font>

1294
00:49:22,180 --> 00:49:26,828
text data retention which really<font color="#CCCCCC"> if we</font>

1295
00:49:24,970 --> 00:49:28,480
were to be honest about it<font color="#E5E5E5"> is merely</font>

1296
00:49:26,829 --> 00:49:30,039
shedding light on things that the

1297
00:49:28,480 --> 00:49:31,690
government's already been doing for

1298
00:49:30,039 --> 00:49:33,309
decades like why are they even bothering

1299
00:49:31,690 --> 00:49:35,559
to bring it<font color="#CCCCCC"> out in the open what they</font>

1300
00:49:33,309 --> 00:49:37,749
<font color="#E5E5E5">just keep it behind closed doors and</font>

1301
00:49:35,559 --> 00:49:40,329
<font color="#E5E5E5">clandestine like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the have been i think</font>

1302
00:49:37,749 --> 00:49:41,828
<font color="#CCCCCC">that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i think i think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that the reason</font>

1303
00:49:40,329 --> 00:49:44,259
that they're looking for legislation is

1304
00:49:41,829 --> 00:49:46,390
because even if even if the NSA has

1305
00:49:44,259 --> 00:49:48,190
significant capabilities currently<font color="#E5E5E5"> where</font>

1306
00:49:46,390 --> 00:49:49,538
they don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> are that worried about</font>

1307
00:49:48,190 --> 00:49:52,150
encryption<font color="#CCCCCC"> I i would say</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's more about</font>

1308
00:49:49,539 --> 00:49:53,980
law enforcement<font color="#E5E5E5"> access to encrypted</font>

1309
00:49:52,150 --> 00:49:55,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">technology</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> where you were you maybe</font>

1310
00:49:53,980 --> 00:50:00,369
don't currently have that same<font color="#E5E5E5"> level of</font>

1311
00:49:55,480 --> 00:50:02,319
<font color="#CCCCCC">access and self united and a building by</font>

1312
00:50:00,369 --> 00:50:04,420
saying things like terrorism<font color="#E5E5E5"> and child</font>

1313
00:50:02,319 --> 00:50:06,308
<font color="#CCCCCC">rotation that kind of stuff but you know</font>

1314
00:50:04,420 --> 00:50:07,839
I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> there is still wouldn't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

1315
00:50:06,309 --> 00:50:09,190
wouldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> say that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> were wearing a</font>

1316
00:50:07,839 --> 00:50:10,660
hopeless place<font color="#E5E5E5"> where the government is</font>

1317
00:50:09,190 --> 00:50:12,190
doing all<font color="#CCCCCC"> that stuff</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> already i think</font>

1318
00:50:10,660 --> 00:50:14,680
they're ours are still protections that

1319
00:50:12,190 --> 00:50:19,480
are<font color="#CCCCCC"> are important that of been valuable</font>

1320
00:50:14,680 --> 00:50:22,749
<font color="#CCCCCC">yeah</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah it looks like that's it</font>

1321
00:50:19,480 --> 00:50:23,930
so thank you guys for<font color="#E5E5E5"> your name adding a</font>

1322
00:50:22,749 --> 00:50:31,810
great question
