me and we<font color="#CCCCCC"> could skip the pitch part and</font>

353
00:16:17,070 --> 00:16:22,020
get straight to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> how do we work</font>

354
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:23,280
together to build a techno utopian ideal

355

of our dreams

356
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:28,650
those were good days<font color="#E5E5E5"> but sometimes I got</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">sometimes you would say Tom Tom I get</font>

368
00:16:57,570 --> 00:17:03,960
important part there and then and then

369
00:17:00,510 --> 00:17:06,209
after this you know that conversation I

370
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:08,550
had to take time out of my busy schedule

371
00:17:06,209 --> 00:17:10,770
of building this techno utopia that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see in the world and explain to</font>

this person that there's no such thing

as<font color="#CCCCCC"> wizards and if there were why would a</font>

wizard need a nuke that doesn't make any

376
00:17:17,819 --> 00:17:24,849
sense<font color="#CCCCCC"> and yes it's understandable to be</font>

377
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:27,520
afraid of<font color="#E5E5E5"> terror</font>

prism of<font color="#CCCCCC"> other threats but that's really</font>

379
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:31,990
an improbable scenario and did you know

380
00:17:29,770 --> 00:17:33,668
that terrorists have other really good

381
00:17:31,990 --> 00:17:36,010
ways to communicate secretly without

382

384
00:17:39,070 --> 00:17:42,490
conversation exhausting and it really is

385
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:45,549
exhausting to have that conversation

386
00:17:42,490 --> 00:17:47,470
over and over again<font color="#E5E5E5"> but it takes away</font>

387
00:17:45,549 --> 00:17:50,470
that important time that you could be

this with journalism yet but<font color="#CCCCCC"> but here's</font>

the trick this is the one weird trick

that you read in the session description

less plausible stories about people who

us<font color="#CCCCCC"> harm</font>

496
00:22:13,980 --> 00:22:20,820
it's very easy to be afraid and when

497
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:21,690
you're afraid<font color="#CCCCCC"> you literally can't think</font>

straight

499
00:22:21,690 --> 00:22:28,950
it's it's not possible to have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

bring literally can't do that

503
00:22:33,210 --> 00:22:38,190
so when people are afraid they dwell on

00:22:36,659 --> 00:22:43,260
those negative outcomes on those

505
