1
00:00:02,500 --> 00:00:04,170
tab is rather legendary

2
00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:07,580
taps into a technological assistance
program

3
00:00:07,580 --> 00:00:11,650
it started life on may first nineteen
seventy-one

4
00:00:11,650 --> 00:00:15,080
when abbie hoffman any phone free call

5
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:19,630
L bell decided they wanted to have a
technical newsletter

6
00:00:19,630 --> 00:00:23,669
because there was well if you saw the
movie the president analysts

7
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:27,529
it turned out that the enemy of the
country was

8
00:00:27,529 --> 00:00:31,070
he PC yes

9
00:00:31,070 --> 00:00:34,260
it turned out that the only was via
phone

10
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:37,469
company your and

11
00:00:37,469 --> 00:00:41,000
I'm I'll they decided that yes

12
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,789
you know the bell system was oppressing
people and and the they were

13
00:00:44,789 --> 00:00:46,039
overcharging

14
00:00:46,039 --> 00:00:49,640
and the way that things were going on
was that

15
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:53,020
whatever Bell could justify spending in

16
00:00:53,020 --> 00:00:56,079
setting up the local phone company your
local phone service

17
00:00:56,079 --> 00:01:01,270
they were required by law and they made
sure those laws got past

18
00:01:01,270 --> 00:01:06,990
to make back that money plus a radar
return for their shareholders

19
00:01:06,990 --> 00:01:10,280
well you know this was solved

20
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:14,640
you know capitalism at its worst in time
for the yippies youth international

21
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:15,240
party

22
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:20,169
to spearhead a way to break into the
phone network in such

23
00:01:20,170 --> 00:01:24,520
and I'll they came up with the
disgruntled telephone engineer in God

24
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:25,950
for Sega Massachusetts

25
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:30,070
I and the black box on

26
00:01:30,070 --> 00:01:34,939
I'm so I'm not 100% sure today if you
look at the 2600 teacher with the blue

27
00:01:34,939 --> 00:01:35,880
by schematic

28
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:38,949
up in the corner it says

29
00:01:38,950 --> 00:01:42,200
where it all began and as the schematic
diagram

30
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:47,829
yes thank you would you hold that up
please that

31
00:01:47,829 --> 00:01:51,900
thank you on

32
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:53,929
yums

33
00:01:53,929 --> 00:01:57,969
where it all began and it's the
schematic for the black box

34
00:01:57,969 --> 00:02:00,920
which gets hooked up with the little
switch in when you know your friend is

35
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:01,630
calling

36
00:02:01,630 --> 00:02:05,060
you throw the switch the phone rings

37
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:08,989
you pick up the phone you talk to your
friend in wherever

38
00:02:08,989 --> 00:02:12,049
and when you hang up the building
equipment one wonders

39
00:02:12,049 --> 00:02:18,170
why'd you let the phone ring for 25
minutes the on

40
00:02:18,170 --> 00:02:23,000
that's where it started a about three or
four races into

41
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,360
your ball why I P L the youth
international

42
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:33,299
party-line yeah many of the youngsters
do not understand what a party line was

43
00:02:33,299 --> 00:02:34,480
in rural America

44
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:39,359
are you the thought this was the history
of tap it a little history telephony

45
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:40,420
excuse me I

46
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:45,629
must digress party lines were when one
where was strung out the central office

47
00:02:45,629 --> 00:02:50,858
down all the farm road and every farm
along the way we get a drop

48
00:02:50,859 --> 00:02:55,980
and Farmer Brown would get one short one
long-running

49
00:02:55,980 --> 00:03:00,518
and farmer Smith would get are too short
one long et cetera

50
00:03:00,519 --> 00:03:04,139
the different codes for with the call
was floored

51
00:03:04,139 --> 00:03:08,670
and these party lines well you can when
you heard the ring for your neighbor you

52
00:03:08,670 --> 00:03:10,380
can pick up the most in Newnan

53
00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:14,109
and so it became a way up the
neighborhood finding out what's going on

54
00:03:14,109 --> 00:03:18,639
well the youth international party line
was away for the UP community

55
00:03:18,639 --> 00:03:23,769
and fellow travelers are technologically
minded people who may not be added to

56
00:03:23,769 --> 00:03:25,780
the revolution but like the technology
other

57
00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:29,389
all would share information through the
newsletter

58
00:03:29,389 --> 00:03:34,160
bed 45 issues in el baile to collect his
newsletter

59
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:38,430
and said what's always political crap
doing in here

60
00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:42,459
picked it up move that would you be
headquarters

61
00:03:42,459 --> 00:03:47,419
set up shop on a zoning change the name
to tap the technological American party

62
00:03:47,419 --> 00:03:51,959
that ran for a couple this use and then
became the technological assistance

63
00:03:51,959 --> 00:03:53,139
program

64
00:03:53,139 --> 00:03:58,139
you ever tried to open a bank account
with the word party in your name when

65
00:03:58,139 --> 00:03:59,940
you're not a bona fide political party

66
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:03,620
world it was a problem so

67
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:07,669
that's why the change the american all
the technological Assistance Program

68
00:04:07,669 --> 00:04:10,959
on people still call the

69
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:14,419
the technological American party for a
long time but that was the official name

70
00:04:14,419 --> 00:04:17,759
on Al Bell ran the newsletter for number
two years

71
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:21,650
and then tom edison's ago over I'll

72
00:04:21,649 --> 00:04:26,380
and he ran for another goodly number
beers and tom was at the helm

73
00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:29,430
when I moved to New York City in 1976

74
00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:34,960
and I'd been hopping from town to town
from upstate New York where I live so

75
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:35,810
the Boston

76
00:04:35,810 --> 00:04:40,240
Massachusetts area world for a while
need you sync app now and then

77
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:44,150
subscribing now and then and then I
moved to the city in recent scribed in

78
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:49,180
and they say that everyone see could
drop by 1201 Broadway on the 7th floor I

79
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:50,080
believe it was

80
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:53,318
and come to their gatherings and help
them put them together in this and that

81
00:04:53,319 --> 00:04:56,690
nobody year later I finally found a
Wednesday free

82
00:04:56,690 --> 00:05:00,160
and I went down there and met the gang
in phnom

83
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:03,319
surveyed hanging out so helping pace the
thing up

84
00:05:03,319 --> 00:05:06,669
as you recall all the blurb for tap was

85
00:05:06,669 --> 00:05:10,758
all the news that that's well

86
00:05:10,759 --> 00:05:15,210
palm it's it's strictly cut and paste in
those days we didn't have desktop

87
00:05:15,210 --> 00:05:16,280
publishing

88
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:20,639
its what you pay stub is what you get
and we get these letters

89
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:25,110
some of them tight if they were tired
okay maybe goes in trouble typing were

90
00:05:25,110 --> 00:05:26,000
really good

91
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,530
but mostly we take these type then
things cut them up

92
00:05:29,530 --> 00:05:33,860
laymen's a bit reduce it down 75 percent

93
00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:36,889
printed out on are 11 by 22

94
00:05:36,889 --> 00:05:40,650
folded it may have by 11 and

95
00:05:40,650 --> 00:05:44,080
be wait until we had two issues to mail
up and send the mail

96
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:49,370
and from yams really old days

97
00:05:49,370 --> 00:05:54,810
I home one day was boasting an article
about my activities

98
00:05:54,810 --> 00:05:59,669
all doing something and somebody had
submitted an article

99
00:05:59,669 --> 00:06:03,049
on maris that the maritime
communications satellite and how to

100
00:06:03,050 --> 00:06:04,520
fiddle with the voice circuits

101
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:08,789
well fortunately I was there that night
is time was pasting it up

102
00:06:08,789 --> 00:06:12,200
then and i knows that my article

103
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:15,200
always being put opposite this other
article I want

104
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:19,040
oh no I'm using a pseudonym the COMSAT
knows

105
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:22,150
because I'd use mirrors that

106
00:06:22,150 --> 00:06:25,590
I have to tell like circuits and

107
00:06:25,590 --> 00:06:30,120
um they might think that this was me are
telling about the

108
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:33,330
mayor said stop and I was given that
stuff out mom

109
00:06:33,330 --> 00:06:37,889
because things went into tap tended to
go away bomb

110
00:06:37,889 --> 00:06:42,120
I couldn't imagine that anybody in the
real world read this of course

111
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:46,120
arm we probably want more telephone
security officers then tell them in a

112
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:47,520
men's magazine

113
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:52,609
but definitely understand our stuff your

114
00:06:52,610 --> 00:06:57,000
and I'm its as a result I needed a quick

115
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:02,389
name change and that's not remembered my
old high school chemistry

116
00:07:02,389 --> 00:07:07,160
are studies when we were talking about
certain chemical reactions

117
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:11,270
and I've been reading is everything ball
on

118
00:07:11,270 --> 00:07:15,250
book by Carol and came up with the name
Cheshire catalyst

119
00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:18,260
and wouldn't it be nifty to use it
Sunday

120
00:07:18,260 --> 00:07:21,460
and sell it came to me in a good time

121
00:07:21,460 --> 00:07:25,380
and just landed typewriter tied it up
quick pasted down

122
00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:28,669
and ever since then I've been the
Cheshire catalyst

123
00:07:28,669 --> 00:07:31,469
and a great people want to know who the
judge a catalyst is not the first

124
00:07:31,470 --> 00:07:33,940
element you gesture

125
00:07:33,940 --> 00:07:37,630
and they're happy with that

126
00:07:37,630 --> 00:07:39,750
most people know the Peter Parker
spider-man

127
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:43,560
that Superman's Clark and and

128
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:47,140
a third-level stricken privacy purposes

129
00:07:47,140 --> 00:07:51,340
never occurs to people and with the
cameras rolling that is fundamentally

130
00:07:51,340 --> 00:07:52,100
the right now

131
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:55,150
all the fellow from technology

132
00:07:55,150 --> 00:07:59,440
illustrated put it the best Richard
Cheshire isn't his real name

133
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:06,440
in fact it's not even his real pseudonym
the on if you really wanna know my real

134
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:06,850
name

135
00:08:06,850 --> 00:08:10,670
that's fine come up to me later i'm
happy to tell you individually

136
00:08:10,670 --> 00:08:14,220
but when they get off the evening news
or when they get another newspaper The

137
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:15,040
Magazine

138
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:18,300
and they they got my number two
directors that since because I keep an

139
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:19,130
extra listing

140
00:08:19,130 --> 00:08:23,260
and I pick up the phone and say hey Jess
you I know

141
00:08:23,260 --> 00:08:26,320
0 I know why they're calling me

142
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:30,020
I know where they're coming from and I
just

143
00:08:30,020 --> 00:08:34,200
you know flying in the first
thirty-seven seconds

144
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:37,620
I'll probably tell them my name because
is the worst kept secret on three

145
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:38,370
continents

146
00:08:38,370 --> 00:08:41,669
it would have been for my buddy forgot
to mention it when he was in Australia

147
00:08:41,669 --> 00:08:45,819
yes on good thing is

148
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:49,810
when made

149
00:08:49,810 --> 00:08:53,700
the you know down when they

150
00:08:53,700 --> 00:09:00,360
Reid Chapel bed tap they wouldn't worry
about us

151
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:04,020
and by why didn't you know hey

152
00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:07,040
I'm not the kinda guy you've really got
to worry about

153
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:10,719
okay some of our writers maybe you
should worry about but

154
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:14,100
alms I want to keep things

155
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:17,790
as cool and is above board so that

156
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:21,510
when I was followed when my phone was
tapped things you just

157
00:09:21,510 --> 00:09:24,960
assume we're going to happen when they
file their reports on me

158
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:28,690
hey you know I'm not the guy you want to
worry about

159
00:09:28,690 --> 00:09:32,920
and I'll let you know where I'm going in
which come because I'm going to and you

160
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:35,900
know send all your guys after me to
check out what I'm doing in this and

161
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:36,840
then the other thing

162
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:40,610
but I was more worried about them

163
00:09:40,610 --> 00:09:45,000
worrying about me because

164
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,050
on if they don't know what you're doing

165
00:09:48,050 --> 00:09:53,170
then they get scared stuff was and the
other do something about it

166
00:09:53,170 --> 00:09:57,920
and so I would just you know on the
phones all your mug on of that the

167
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:00,890
conference in IEEE show or whatever and
then just

168
00:10:00,890 --> 00:10:04,120
on would assume there was nothing

169
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:07,890
assume the following is you and every
once in a while

170
00:10:07,890 --> 00:10:10,930
there was proof been there was the

171
00:10:10,930 --> 00:10:14,500
Pennsylvania State Police photos um

172
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:17,960
that showed up at one friend in a
gathering ok on

173
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:21,810
finally rents got too expensive in
Manhattan we couldn't afford to have a

174
00:10:21,810 --> 00:10:22,430
place

175
00:10:22,430 --> 00:10:25,720
Obama in office our own and we all went
to

176
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:29,520
meeting in different restaurants around
town and

177
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:34,150
I'm you lately closed up behind us to or
reincarnated

178
00:10:34,150 --> 00:10:38,030
and became very cheesy and couldn't
afford them anymore and things like that

179
00:10:38,030 --> 00:10:41,970
we had a couple really good diets that
would just love but you know

180
00:10:41,970 --> 00:10:46,220
I know once we got there but can I say
home

181
00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:50,070
the

182
00:10:50,070 --> 00:10:51,200
the

183
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:58,040
did when on until Tom Edison got
firebombs

184
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:02,310
he went out to an amusement park because
he's a real rollercoaster free

185
00:11:02,310 --> 00:11:05,790
came home divine fire trucks

186
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:09,740
County Sheriff and I'll

187
00:11:09,740 --> 00:11:13,769
it turned out that it was a really good
break in

188
00:11:13,769 --> 00:11:20,040
they knew how to get in and it was a
really botched up

189
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:26,360
arson and of course the mere speculation
this is not fair at this is near

190
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:29,880
innuendo because this is just up that we
think about it

191
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:35,209
but you know telco usually hires a bunch
of old FB i

192
00:11:35,209 --> 00:11:38,250
people to work and there's a cure
departments in this that these are

193
00:11:38,250 --> 00:11:39,120
people who

194
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:42,230
remember people they set up and

195
00:11:42,230 --> 00:11:45,480
arm so they know how to find breaking
artists and they may not know how to

196
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:46,720
find her since I don't know

197
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:50,680
mere speculation just blindly have

198
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:54,139
be wouldn't even want to a chance to
throw

199
00:11:54,139 --> 00:11:59,279
any innuendo towards the telephone
company wins

200
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:04,180
on at any rate I got the phone call from
Thoman said gesture

201
00:12:04,180 --> 00:12:07,389
I've just been firebombs

202
00:12:07,389 --> 00:12:12,680
get your ass down here with the truck or
its all going in the dumpster

203
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:15,310
Ste

204
00:12:15,310 --> 00:12:18,930
look I do I got my roommate we rented a
truck we went over we got the stuff

205
00:12:18,930 --> 00:12:22,350
we hold the back we heard a a locker and
and

206
00:12:22,350 --> 00:12:27,480
mostly it was I have my living room arm

207
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:31,400
they didn't go through the house very
well most the cap stuff was in the

208
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:31,930
basement

209
00:12:31,930 --> 00:12:36,339
and they had ports in gasoline upstairs
in a recreation room with all these

210
00:12:36,339 --> 00:12:37,029
tapes

211
00:12:37,029 --> 00:12:40,060
his real to real

212
00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:45,620
tapes yeah these you know look good the
pre-recorded South

213
00:12:45,620 --> 00:12:49,910
the good stuff there was little

214
00:12:49,910 --> 00:12:54,650
and arm so the ports in gasoline on the
floor there took out

215
00:12:54,650 --> 00:12:58,260
like his bills collections the worst
part that when and some of the others

216
00:12:58,260 --> 00:12:59,600
and others received

217
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:03,890
downstairs in living room they pored
over his couch lit

218
00:13:03,890 --> 00:13:07,400
and ran well the couch was close enough
to the window

219
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:11,150
there with the heat it blew out the
window and fed the flames

220
00:13:11,150 --> 00:13:14,970
upstairs they never opened the window so
it flared

221
00:13:14,970 --> 00:13:19,080
8 the accident and died still so that's
why was a botched are some

222
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:23,330
Aug neighbors call the fire department
but

223
00:13:23,330 --> 00:13:26,790
all the capcure was downstairs and
untouched by the fire

224
00:13:26,790 --> 00:13:30,660
well this was in the spring

225
00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:35,880
all those 83 I think it was are all
summer I've 83

226
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:39,750
late late spring early summer and it was
coming up to

227
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:43,180
telecom 83 the once

228
00:13:43,180 --> 00:13:48,830
every four years huge symposium held by
the International Telecommunications

229
00:13:48,830 --> 00:13:49,610
Union

230
00:13:49,610 --> 00:13:55,950
in Geneva Switzerland and so I was able
to eke out another the budget

231
00:13:55,950 --> 00:13:59,770
I could go over you know crash with
people

232
00:13:59,770 --> 00:14:03,610
on met people in the press room and that
was really cool to because

233
00:14:03,610 --> 00:14:07,270
here up course I publish a newsletter so
I can get but his press credentials

234
00:14:07,270 --> 00:14:12,560
if I can get to a trade show the let me
in so the hard part is the airfare

235
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:16,800
and then it's where I can find 64 space
the sleeping bag 11

236
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:21,940
the on and we went to gym evil

237
00:14:21,940 --> 00:14:25,900
so that I can hang out throat have
newsletters all over the place

238
00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:29,370
thrown under the nose at the AT&T booth

239
00:14:29,370 --> 00:14:32,550
said me anyway we ain't dead yet

240
00:14:32,550 --> 00:14:37,130
the on and that's what that was about

241
00:14:37,130 --> 00:14:41,570
they actually got some good European
publicity now all

242
00:14:41,570 --> 00:14:44,910
I like to play the publicity machine the
way some people like to play pinball

243
00:14:44,910 --> 00:14:48,199
I admit that and

244
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:54,100
home I'm a little picky about who I
played ball with the machine with

245
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:57,740
National Public Radio I'll do anything
for

246
00:14:57,740 --> 00:15:01,360
I love NPR they are my primary source of
news

247
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:04,890
you know what those people all Pacific
Bell

248
00:15:04,890 --> 00:15:08,810
ago on my way to help them as well on

249
00:15:08,810 --> 00:15:12,150
TV networks need me

250
00:15:12,150 --> 00:15:16,060
in people believe TV

251
00:15:16,060 --> 00:15:19,200
much too easily and not only that

252
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:24,170
the only guy the tells the public what
they're gonna see

253
00:15:24,170 --> 00:15:27,330
is the video editor back in the shop

254
00:15:27,330 --> 00:15:30,610
not the guy with the microphone in your
face

255
00:15:30,610 --> 00:15:34,850
not the guy with the camera not the
sound mean my trek

256
00:15:34,850 --> 00:15:38,110
my real trick was coming up with the
sound bites

257
00:15:38,110 --> 00:15:41,360
me in this day in age we know what the
calm I didn't know what I was calling

258
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:42,330
back then

259
00:15:42,330 --> 00:15:46,880
most common short pithy phrase is men
finally found the germ sound bites

260
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:50,100
but I'd come up with the sound bite that

261
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:54,050
would grad the editors attentions oh
yeah we got to use that one

262
00:15:54,050 --> 00:15:57,150
and I you know

263
00:15:57,150 --> 00:16:00,850
I would just over the years come up with
all these different sound bites

264
00:16:00,850 --> 00:16:06,360
that would get the point across you know
all the thing about how law for decades

265
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:07,280
IBM

266
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:10,650
I'll cons the public into believing

267
00:16:10,650 --> 00:16:13,319
that you had to be a a member of the
computer please to to understand

268
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:14,340
computers

269
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:18,200
and of course the kids him around that
long day been brainwashed

270
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:22,010
they play with their color 64 that home
they go to school

271
00:16:22,010 --> 00:16:26,540
elementary school though the Apple 202
middle school work and IBM PCs

272
00:16:26,540 --> 00:16:30,280
find a modem dialogue all IBM 370

273
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:35,870
as/400 just another machine and the just
another machine line has been on your

274
00:16:35,870 --> 00:16:38,150
television sets

275
00:16:38,150 --> 00:16:41,490
it's a good sound bite but

276
00:16:41,490 --> 00:16:45,470
I hate taking the chance with American
television now

277
00:16:45,470 --> 00:16:50,060
overseas television I've been told in
Italy on I was invited

278
00:16:50,060 --> 00:16:54,910
to Switzerland on I got to play with
video editing machine

279
00:16:54,910 --> 00:16:58,520
and oppose it excuse me miss the gesture
but in the fifty-minute you have played

280
00:16:58,520 --> 00:17:01,380
this machine you have some more
experienced it's about people with the

281
00:17:01,380 --> 00:17:01,960
yields

282
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:07,170
the but it was a little you know there's
a keyboard and some other stuff

283
00:17:07,170 --> 00:17:10,990
if you will the timing and I knew one
trick about continuity

284
00:17:10,990 --> 00:17:14,849
cuz are taking the table this sconce was
built car

285

where we were back in the woods and all

289
00:17:27,510 --> 00:17:31,920

Utah similar people don't really expect
them but sure that you know something

292
00:17:37,380 --> 00:17:39,910
about they're talking about even if it's
wrong

293
00:17:39,910 --> 00:17:44,290
but you show that you got interest in
their area and you know something that

294
00:17:44,290 --> 00:17:44,820

300
00:18:00,050 --> 00:18:01,430
with social engineering

301
00:18:01,430 --> 00:18:04,860
and all sorts of things um

302
00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:08,390

309
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:30,480
Brooklyn

310
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:34,700
and it was dracula p.m. some storage
locker when I was offered a job in

311
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:35,290
Florida

312
00:18:35,290 --> 00:18:40,920
and it wasn't that bigger job than once
I got there they cut my salary on me but

313
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:41,470
it was

314
00:18:41,470 --> 00:18:46,470
still a fine job and I moved there
because I get to live right next to the

315
00:18:46,470 --> 00:18:47,490
Kennedy Space Center

316
00:18:47,490 --> 00:18:50,850
I like to watch things go up alright

317
00:18:50,850 --> 00:18:55,610
I admit it I'm a space cadet time we'll
go right that

318
00:18:55,610 --> 00:18:59,750

322
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:13,820
know that space ranger because I'm too
old look like a space cadet

323
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:18,909

324
00:19:18,910 --> 00:19:22,240

tourist telling what's going up

326
00:19:26,020 --> 00:19:30,210
and so that's why I'm doing these days
is some

327
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:33,880
spreading the knowledge in a different
area technology

328
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:37,040
also because I was now living in Florida

329
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:40,310
in fact are the part of Florida living
in

330
00:19:40,310 --> 00:19:44,330
raison que space at him and you is an
area I referred to as

331
00:19:44,330 --> 00:19:48,620
world if you don't bring your own
entertainment to get a hall of all the

332
00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:50,300
way to Orlando to do something decent

333
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:53,669
so on my by the local ham radio club

334
00:19:53,670 --> 00:19:57,370
under the novice class got my tech plus

335
00:19:57,370 --> 00:19:59,890
wasn't there was just technician at the
time six months later that you know the

336
00:19:59,890 --> 00:20:00,890
Nokia license

337
00:20:00,890 --> 00:20:07,470
arm but I'm play with a packet radio
data communications over ham radio

338
00:20:07,470 --> 00:20:10,470
also I don't need to dry in breaking the
networks

339
00:20:10,470 --> 00:20:13,970
to get away I get a place in Great
Britain in three days

340
00:20:13,970 --> 00:20:18,710
legally you know just out labor laws
some equipment

341
00:20:18,710 --> 00:20:22,350
and it's been some fun times well
someone may not seem so far but there

342
00:20:22,350 --> 00:20:23,290
sure interesting

343
00:20:23,290 --> 00:20:27,129
there was the eight-hour shift I pulled
in Oakland after the earthquake about a

344
00:20:27,130 --> 00:20:28,860
week after the earthquake

345
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:32,390
all that gave me time in grade

346
00:20:32,390 --> 00:20:37,080
when Andrew came around because that may
be the only hand in Pinellas County

347
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:43,820
with actual disaster experience so I get
lead the Kenyan team down to homes that

348
00:20:43,820 --> 00:20:48,149
and that was interesting stuff theme was
down there

349
00:20:48,150 --> 00:20:51,820
they had a couple or semis stolen gear

350
00:20:51,820 --> 00:20:55,750
you look into homestead feel hospital
which two weeks before had been the

351
00:20:55,750 --> 00:20:57,750
homestead Senior Center

352
00:20:57,750 --> 00:21:01,500
you picked up a phone on their little
PBX

353
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:05,260
you punch 9 it went out to the truck

354
00:21:05,260 --> 00:21:11,750
up this Telstar 601 down to Maryland and
give you Maryland I'll Tom

355
00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:16,900
it was slicked that truck had everything
from DC to white

356
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:19,900
and it was slick so

357
00:21:19,900 --> 00:21:24,470
I still be able to play with the tech
stuff I keep going down to my at&t phone

358
00:21:24,470 --> 00:21:27,460
center storage harassing them so when I
get ISDN

359
00:21:27,460 --> 00:21:31,560
yeah when they are ISDN

360
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:34,580
won't let more sense for I still don't
know

361
00:21:34,580 --> 00:21:41,580
they will actually its integrated
services digital network tonight try to

362
00:21:41,580 --> 00:21:43,120
educate them

363
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:47,020
so that's somewhere down the line when
they go to a summer match with that

364
00:21:47,020 --> 00:21:48,920
beard and we're always talking about

365
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:52,360
the

366
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:55,590
and you know hopefully and give them
enough interested some customers out

367
00:21:55,590 --> 00:21:56,040
there

368
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:59,840
might want to know

369
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:03,159
so arm that pretty much covers

370
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:08,070
what I did what I had been doing and
done to take any questions

371
00:22:08,070 --> 00:22:15,070
yes yeah

372
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,850
the

373
00:22:17,850 --> 00:22:19,990
the

374
00:22:19,990 --> 00:22:23,290
the

375
00:22:23,290 --> 00:22:28,629
lady chill it's a comic book first
believe me he didn't need to keep

376
00:22:28,630 --> 00:22:31,809
smell

377
00:22:31,809 --> 00:22:35,010
no I I wouldn't even call it that

378
00:22:35,010 --> 00:22:39,850
this wink graphic now this is pure comic
book hmmm

379
00:22:39,850 --> 00:22:43,390
barnum ok what the question was

380
00:22:43,390 --> 00:22:46,429
what I compile all the back issues and
tap

381
00:22:46,429 --> 00:22:51,050
with my personal experiences into a book
know I will say that I have dreamed

382
00:22:51,050 --> 00:22:52,909
about putting out all the issues

383
00:22:52,910 --> 00:22:56,500
are you know as a book I

384
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:59,850
have even gone so far as to find out a
couple publishers

385
00:22:59,850 --> 00:23:04,270
that or do some paper covers stuff that
wouldn't be that expensive because

386
00:23:04,270 --> 00:23:08,780
are it's not like I'm not to make the
high-priced book so I can make the box

387
00:23:08,780 --> 00:23:12,059
my whole thing is always been spread the
knowledge

388
00:23:12,059 --> 00:23:15,460
get the word out you note due to steep
as I

389
00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:19,630
I can afford to do it to get it out so
book ladies and gents

390
00:23:19,630 --> 00:23:24,020
were talkin its ten years since the
newsletter died

391
00:23:24,020 --> 00:23:28,200
all wall the good information is at
least 20 years old

392
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:32,960
the stuff you're looking for you dead
dying or isn't pure historical interest

393
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:33,720
only

394
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:36,820
but you not the first one to ask

395
00:23:36,820 --> 00:23:41,129
there is enough interest that I could
probably put out the book

396
00:23:41,130 --> 00:23:46,370
and I'll tell ya I am thinking about it
yes

397
00:23:46,370 --> 00:23:48,450
who will love you

398
00:23:48,450 --> 00:23:49,950
loading

399
00:23:49,950 --> 00:23:51,010
then

400
00:23:51,010 --> 00:23:55,180
yes home are a couple of mine pissed
about

401
00:23:55,180 --> 00:23:59,800
on and actually thought about going
after all

402
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:02,980
because the one thing I didn't lose

403
00:24:02,980 --> 00:24:06,910
when I couldn't afford the payments on
the locker in Brooklyn

404
00:24:06,910 --> 00:24:11,380
and they auctioned it off am afraid it's
all gone

405
00:24:11,380 --> 00:24:16,350
but some still got taken to Florida with
me and one of them was the corporate

406
00:24:16,350 --> 00:24:17,100
seal

407
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:21,980
for the corporation that was tabbed

408
00:24:21,980 --> 00:24:27,960
so you know if I really want to push it
yeah I could go after 'em

409
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:31,710
but then I wouldn't be getting the now a
gentle

410
00:24:31,710 --> 00:24:35,930
so I know those guys are out there I
know they're making a buck on it

411
00:24:35,930 --> 00:24:39,100
okay but if people are

412
00:24:39,100 --> 00:24:43,450
in my estimation foolish enough to spend
that much money

413
00:24:43,450 --> 00:24:48,110
for information that that that as that
old and decrepit

414
00:24:48,110 --> 00:24:52,570
the you know that they will all the
information that badly

415
00:24:52,570 --> 00:24:56,270
alone go to those guys and get

416
00:24:56,270 --> 00:25:03,270
that's my take on it yes yeah

417
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:09,490
the whatever happens with electronic
issue have tapped online

418
00:25:09,490 --> 00:25:14,590
yield

419
00:25:14,590 --> 00:25:16,409
the

420
00:25:16,410 --> 00:25:20,480
it's an issue that I know nothing about
and never came out

421
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:23,970
%uh the tap newsletter that died with me
yes

422
00:25:23,970 --> 00:25:28,269
yeah

423
00:25:28,269 --> 00:25:34,090
on

424
00:25:34,090 --> 00:25:39,070
yes

425
00:25:39,070 --> 00:25:41,220
I'm

426
00:25:41,220 --> 00:25:42,150
the

427
00:25:42,150 --> 00:25:46,370
okay the gentleman saying there is a
fellow in Kentucky huang thinks

428
00:25:46,370 --> 00:25:49,809
that he had permission to put out the
cap newsletter all

429
00:25:49,809 --> 00:25:53,720
when a fellow in Kentucky surfers than
one point out that app newsletter

430
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:57,740
I threw up from florida for a conference
we set a date

431
00:25:57,740 --> 00:26:01,280
location was the Days Inn on 57th Street

432
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:05,760
then there's a couple people there at
this conference it came to that

433
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:12,140
on and they never showed up because we
were going to discuss it

434
00:26:12,140 --> 00:26:16,179
and they never shown up at all I never
heard from them

435
00:26:16,179 --> 00:26:23,059
again now I am given to understand they
may have actually put something out

436
00:26:23,059 --> 00:26:26,649
I have never seen it

437
00:26:26,650 --> 00:26:31,049
and so the way I have to put the
statement is that is not part of the tap

438
00:26:31,049 --> 00:26:32,960
newsletter that died with me

439
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:36,059
they may have put out something else
would they call tap

440
00:26:36,059 --> 00:26:42,580
yet I see me you were yeah

441
00:26:42,580 --> 00:26:45,840
am i aware that there's a number because
used or electronically on the net

442
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:49,879
on no I'm not are that wouldn't bother
me

443
00:26:49,879 --> 00:26:55,309
and other thing is that what's stored
electronically on the net

444
00:26:55,309 --> 00:26:58,840
would be mostly ASCII text to my correct
yes

445
00:26:58,840 --> 00:27:02,419
arm there was so much in the graphics
attack

446
00:27:02,419 --> 00:27:06,059
have tapped and then how sloppy and then
how

447
00:27:06,059 --> 00:27:10,830
amateurish it was there was one of the
things I was proud up

448
00:27:10,830 --> 00:27:14,428
for the fact that I would hope

449
00:27:14,429 --> 00:27:17,619
that they wouldn't worry about us
because we were

450
00:27:17,619 --> 00:27:21,759
only these you know some smokes putting
out this damn newsletter

451
00:27:21,759 --> 00:27:27,869
on I'm really want to give the
impression hey we're only amateurs out

452
00:27:27,869 --> 00:27:28,399
here

453
00:27:28,399 --> 00:27:32,240
were only taking the information coming
in to us and I'd rather have you

454
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:32,860
following

455
00:27:32,860 --> 00:27:36,129
us we're publishing the trying to track
back to people were actually

456
00:27:36,129 --> 00:27:41,059
submitting in doing things so I kept my
life really clean about then I gotta

457
00:27:41,059 --> 00:27:41,590
tell you

458
00:27:41,590 --> 00:27:45,289
because I assume they were watching

459
00:27:45,289 --> 00:27:48,419
I had to assume that

460
00:27:48,419 --> 00:27:53,190
there's no yes

461
00:27:53,190 --> 00:27:55,360
yeah

462
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:56,090
soon

463
00:27:56,090 --> 00:27:57,950
want to ask you questions

464
00:27:57,950 --> 00:28:02,200
really needs to yeah

465
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:03,370
where you've been

466
00:28:03,370 --> 00:28:10,370
yes

467
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:16,540
wears No K he was my perspective on the
future

468
00:28:16,540 --> 00:28:20,659
where the people here should put their
energies for the future

469
00:28:20,660 --> 00:28:26,020
on

470
00:28:26,020 --> 00:28:27,860
means

471
00:28:27,860 --> 00:28:31,030
that's a hard one for me to answer

472
00:28:31,030 --> 00:28:34,899
arm I think there are another

473
00:28:34,900 --> 00:28:38,460
interesting technologies out there that

474
00:28:38,460 --> 00:28:42,640
there is no need to hack past the bounds
of propriety

475
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:47,750
into cracking on I found interesting
niche in ham radio

476
00:28:47,750 --> 00:28:51,929
with the packet radio stuff so I can
transmit data around

477
00:28:51,929 --> 00:28:56,770
are wirelessly although as a friend of
mine said once it's amazing how many

478
00:28:56,770 --> 00:28:59,090
cables you need for wireless
communications

479
00:28:59,090 --> 00:29:02,880
the and

480
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:06,540
are but there's always that

481
00:29:06,540 --> 00:29:10,860
interest in what's beyond there's a

482
00:29:10,860 --> 00:29:14,919
always that thing the young kids have
love watching to be naughty

483
00:29:14,919 --> 00:29:19,429
and then went to brag about it

484
00:29:19,429 --> 00:29:25,070
on I never address that with tap I just
know that part of human nature

485
00:29:25,070 --> 00:29:29,250
and all I can say is

486
00:29:29,250 --> 00:29:36,250
be careful if y'all don't do anything
really dangerous because if you

487
00:29:36,370 --> 00:29:41,929
if you get into really start worrying
about you they will come down hard

488
00:29:41,929 --> 00:29:45,790
you've got to be careful on

489
00:29:45,790 --> 00:29:51,809
in 1980 a friend of mine was hacking the
Internet

490
00:29:51,809 --> 00:29:55,940
connected to an icy network information
center pull down on that map

491
00:29:55,940 --> 00:30:01,330
won't see also for those looking all the
network I can reach Joe our way out here

492
00:30:01,330 --> 00:30:02,530
in Europe some called

493
00:30:02,530 --> 00:30:06,020
norse are all know what that is

494
00:30:06,020 --> 00:30:10,460
see space nor sergeant welcome to the
Norwegian seismic array

495
00:30:10,460 --> 00:30:13,690
okay Wilson Norway is this site yet

496
00:30:13,690 --> 00:30:16,950
nor size miss the array saw

497
00:30:16,950 --> 00:30:20,830
norse oh okay that makes sense flying
arm

498
00:30:20,830 --> 00:30:25,220
well now that I'm here all let's

name is really dole wants

500
00:30:27,090 --> 00:30:30,480
okay type file name level of boy you
know

501
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:34,120
I don't know much about seismic
information but from what little I know

502
00:30:34,120 --> 00:30:38,700
this is seismic information yeah all

503
00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:42,429
more all that was little latitude
longitude okay

504
00:30:42,429 --> 00:30:46,309
so although I will that was now looking
up the hill in the Soviet Union in in

505
00:30:46,309 --> 00:30:49,200
this new theory they were the nuclear
integral

506
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:53,030
station now

507
00:30:53,030 --> 00:30:56,700
J random hacker was able to pull this
stuff up

508
00:30:56,700 --> 00:30:59,890
is this the game %uh the DOD

509
00:30:59,890 --> 00:31:04,510
playing with the soviets all letting
them know that we know that they know

510
00:31:04,510 --> 00:31:05,460
that we know

511
00:31:05,460 --> 00:31:08,840
is this a game that we should be

512
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:13,580
you know involved in how you call the
CIA and say I'm

513
00:31:13,580 --> 00:31:17,860
excuse me we think you might have a
problem here all we're just Jairam

514
00:31:17,860 --> 00:31:18,669
hackers

515
00:31:18,669 --> 00:31:22,330
we had something called what's eighty
the

516
00:31:22,330 --> 00:31:25,570
Washington area telecommunication
symposium

517
00:31:25,570 --> 00:31:29,668
and um we

518
00:31:29,669 --> 00:31:33,240
generate a lot of publicity %uh AP UPEI

519
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:37,440
releases wow the washington times our TV
cameras showed up

520
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:42,450
are few people in blue coats and ties to
quickly lost the ties

521
00:31:42,450 --> 00:31:45,480
%um which was blind as we wanted we had

522
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:50,100
admission $5 dollars four dollars with
government ID

523
00:31:50,100 --> 00:31:54,370

524
00:31:54,370 --> 00:32:00,280

30 sign right okay let we're here to
have fun and spread the word

526
00:32:04,220 --> 00:32:08,710
and we told the story about yours are
and we don't know but nothing ever

527
00:32:08,710 --> 00:32:10,040
happens on it

528
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:13,389
bottle we wanted to know was said

529
00:32:13,390 --> 00:32:17,919
we're finding this stuff were not
unpatriotic is when the russians come

530
00:32:17,919 --> 00:32:19,050
over Lake Erie

531
00:32:19,050 --> 00:32:22,418
we're the first guys they want to take
out we know how to get you the networks

532
00:32:22,419 --> 00:32:23,850
and be the communications underground

533
00:32:23,850 --> 00:32:27,020
we're gonna they're already didn't

534
00:32:27,020 --> 00:32:31,389
and you know we do the russians we are
friends

535
00:32:31,390 --> 00:32:35,510
I mean yet we're long-haired scraggly
you know and and you think we're all

536
00:32:35,510 --> 00:32:39,059
kinds but you know we threw out the
politicians back when we came from you

537
00:32:39,059 --> 00:32:41,100
but the Dept you know come on we're
Technos

538
00:32:41,100 --> 00:32:45,620
she's home the really paranoid can't get

539
00:32:45,620 --> 00:32:48,790
over the suspect it will being so
friendly and trying to help them

540
00:32:48,790 --> 00:32:52,899
and what-have-you but you wire leading
so friendly Yun

541
00:32:52,900 --> 00:32:58,169
so but when we were face to what we
thought was a llamame

542
00:32:58,169 --> 00:33:01,720
we did it in the most public way we
could did it again

543
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:04,960
share the knowledge that it could be
done the

544
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:08,200
it was hackable and I really think that
tap

545
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:14,380
and 2600 today it's near tap on the
underground let's face it

546
00:33:14,380 --> 00:33:19,100
and in fact I almost marketed tap that
way on a friend of mine

547
00:33:19,100 --> 00:33:24,230
runs a telecommunications magazine and
you want to give me the mailing list

548
00:33:24,230 --> 00:33:27,790
at his magazine subscribers to do a
mailing

549
00:33:27,790 --> 00:33:31,720
and this is just before cap died and I
have the letter all done now has been

550
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:34,929
entered into a lease direct mailing
contest I was a problem that

551
00:33:34,929 --> 00:33:38,640
and it was dear mister mumble can you
afford not to know what the fuck is

552
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:39,659
going on

553
00:33:39,659 --> 00:33:46,530
the first line was designed

554
00:33:46,530 --> 00:33:51,639
d either showed him right down and small
thing in the trash

555
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:55,059
or he was hooked

556
00:33:55,059 --> 00:33:58,550
and I'm you know I have fun

557
00:33:58,550 --> 00:34:01,570
crafting though that kinda words nothing

558
00:34:01,570 --> 00:34:05,620
but arm the business side of the house
is now where I come from

559
00:34:05,620 --> 00:34:10,070
never has been I've learned my lesson
