1
00:00:00,089 --> 00:00:03,290
the

2
00:00:03,290 --> 00:00:06,500
yeah in this session is pagers

3
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:10,799
and everyone most people have on that
few people really know what they're all

4
00:00:10,799 --> 00:00:12,719
about exactly how they work and

5
00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:16,180
are you gonna talk about setting up your
own paging system

6
00:00:16,180 --> 00:00:20,279
and some little tricks you can do with
that setting up your own paging system

7
00:00:20,279 --> 00:00:23,820
I'm gonna start by just giving a basic
overview

8
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:30,820
on how pagers work

9
00:00:31,099 --> 00:00:38,099
me steezy churches handwriting

10
00:00:41,140 --> 00:00:42,339
the

11
00:00:42,339 --> 00:00:47,089
gets really basic basic diagram of how
paging system works

12
00:00:47,089 --> 00:00:52,629
I starts with telephone person picks up
his phone and dial is the paging system

13
00:00:52,629 --> 00:00:55,718
it then goes into it computer system

14
00:00:55,719 --> 00:01:00,629
which will receive the touchstones and
convert it to a format that can be

15
00:01:00,629 --> 00:01:05,309
sent over the air efficiently I usually
paging systems they have several

16
00:01:05,309 --> 00:01:09,298
different formats are the most common
it's just basic ASCII data

17
00:01:09,299 --> 00:01:13,960
I did send free frequency shift keying
it then goes to a

18
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:17,810
radio transmitter which then sends it
out over the air

19
00:01:17,810 --> 00:01:22,190
on hand then when your pager receives it
your

20
00:01:22,190 --> 00:01:26,670
pager goes off its pretty basic when you
really look at it

21
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:33,670
now looking inside a pager home

22
00:01:38,210 --> 00:01:43,049
case you can see this really not allowed
to earn pagers basically antenna

23
00:01:43,049 --> 00:01:48,479
really small antenna hooked into a radio
receiver the output of which goes to a I

24
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:50,000
demodulator decoder

25
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,259
and I'll just sit there as long as you
have an iron will wait for you are a

26
00:01:54,259 --> 00:01:57,940
specific got serial number for your
pager which is called a cab code

27
00:01:57,940 --> 00:02:01,810
when it receives your cat heard that
little declared by Julie later

28
00:02:01,810 --> 00:02:05,550
turns itself on and receive your data
are your phone number if you have a

29
00:02:05,550 --> 00:02:07,658
numeric pager or if you have no idea

30
00:02:07,659 --> 00:02:12,250
alphanumeric ones you can get a complete
message and when it receives it it and

31
00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:13,070
alert you

32
00:02:13,070 --> 00:02:16,930
other in alerting system page is usually
have a

33
00:02:16,930 --> 00:02:20,100
a buzzer a vibrator or a

34
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:23,950
Bieber audio be really goes off and
that's so

35
00:02:23,950 --> 00:02:27,250
basically how it works as you can see
it's fairly simple

36
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:34,250
are there different types the pagers

37
00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:38,770
the

38
00:02:38,770 --> 00:02:42,640
boquet ha starting the first pages that
came out which phone only

39
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:46,010
on the page you got the code hand it be

40
00:02:46,010 --> 00:02:49,730
you know who beat you all you know is
it's always trying to get in touch with

41
00:02:49,730 --> 00:02:50,140
you

42
00:02:50,140 --> 00:02:53,980
on these very typically hooked into
answering machines

43
00:02:53,980 --> 00:02:54,670
and

44
00:02:54,670 --> 00:02:58,440
and when someone calls your answering
machine a little black box then call

45
00:02:58,440 --> 00:02:59,870
your pager in page you

46
00:02:59,870 --> 00:03:03,510
or doctors use them because the only
person who beat aging

47
00:03:03,510 --> 00:03:06,540
the doctor would be his office so we
know how to call his office

48
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:09,560
then someone got the a bright idea
actually

49
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:13,790
our mark in answering machine with a
pager I actually marketing a voicemail

50
00:03:13,790 --> 00:03:19,150
system with nature and that came out to
be a tone or VR atone VRS pager VRS

51
00:03:19,150 --> 00:03:21,010
stands for voice response system

52
00:03:21,010 --> 00:03:25,109
when you call it up it's just like an
answering machine or a voicemail it out

53
00:03:25,110 --> 00:03:29,300
yet the person's your message in a
progeny leave yours

54
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:32,660
you leave it and then the person gets
paged

55
00:03:32,660 --> 00:03:36,549
and it has a person to call is the are
insistent

56
00:03:36,549 --> 00:03:40,000
and retrieve his messages some just like
a voicemail

57
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,269
on this anyways paging system which

58
00:03:44,269 --> 00:03:49,230
on isn't seen much in commercial use but
a lot of public safety agencies still

59
00:03:49,230 --> 00:03:50,000
use it

60
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,319
and with that system you call it up

61
00:03:53,319 --> 00:03:57,090
it picks up the phone and you're on the
air

62
00:03:57,090 --> 00:04:00,680
it sends out the cap code for the pager

63
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:04,750
opens up a channel to the airwaves and
whatever you say

64
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:08,150
goes out over the guys pager it also
goes out to anyone else happens to be

65
00:04:08,150 --> 00:04:09,450
listening in on the scanner

66
00:04:09,450 --> 00:04:14,850
on then you have the display pagers
switcher than american the alphanumeric

67
00:04:14,850 --> 00:04:18,909
pagers which I'm sure everyone here is
familiar with those the ones where you

68
00:04:18,910 --> 00:04:23,479
here call in ensuring your phone number
and which point the person's page with

69
00:04:23,479 --> 00:04:26,080
the phone earlier calling you can also
enter in a little

70
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:30,840
up 2 of 14 digit numeric code sequence
ensure a little messages with it

71
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:33,960
I'm and then they're the alphanumeric
pagers

72
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:38,969
which you call up any operator asks you
for the pager tell you give it to are

73
00:04:38,970 --> 00:04:45,970
you telling the message in a going page
the person

74
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:51,800
okay now you know how easy you know how
basically has simple pagers are their

75
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:55,070
number ways you can not yet set up your
own paging system

76
00:04:55,070 --> 00:04:58,480
on Radio Shack I'll sell you one for a
hundred dollars

77
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:02,270
which is a basic tone pager on

78
00:05:02,270 --> 00:05:05,659
get a little paging terminal it actually
works on the CB band

79
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:08,770
and you can get up with a decent antenna

80
00:05:08,770 --> 00:05:13,349
about a 20 mile range on a bit under the
best conditions typically it's about a

81
00:05:13,350 --> 00:05:13,990
mile

82
00:05:13,990 --> 00:05:17,260
rule are quarter wave with

83
00:05:17,260 --> 00:05:20,610
which would be about CE

84
00:05:20,610 --> 00:05:26,910
that's three meters high

85
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:32,720
to talk about a nine foot high antenna
you get a 20 foot range on know some CD

86
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:33,750
tone pagers

87
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:39,170
I you can also set up your own voice
paging service if you have any type the

88
00:05:39,170 --> 00:05:42,430
radio transceiver that's capable %uh
setting up

89
00:05:42,430 --> 00:05:46,890
on sending out a tapered signaling I
have a system like that here which I'm

90
00:05:46,890 --> 00:05:48,210
going to demonstrate

91
00:05:48,210 --> 00:05:51,479
and a day it will %uh

92
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:56,690
you basically opening up in a frequency
sending a code and then the unit will

93
00:05:56,690 --> 00:06:01,400
opener this receiver and you can send a
message and if Adam is out there

94
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:04,550
okay

95
00:06:04,550 --> 00:06:08,060
now I set this up on an amateur band
frequency

96
00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:11,840
arms probably one of the best places to
do this because you can run a decent

97
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:16,060
amount of power does require a license
but the nOCO technician licenses

98
00:06:16,060 --> 00:06:19,360
very easy to get and

99
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:23,420
basically most modern transceivers well
on have a

100
00:06:23,420 --> 00:06:27,590
a function called digital code squelch
and that is basically a pager

101
00:06:27,590 --> 00:06:31,410
here receiver sits there and it waits
for a code

102
00:06:31,410 --> 00:06:34,520
in this case to using touchstones and

103
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:37,690
Adam just heat up with mytouch don't
hold

104
00:06:37,690 --> 00:06:41,500
at and all I just got paged

105
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:46,390
the

106
00:06:46,390 --> 00:06:51,440
so do I have any questions

107
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:54,629
go ahead

108
00:06:54,629 --> 00:06:55,190
the

109
00:06:55,190 --> 00:06:55,990
mom

110
00:06:55,990 --> 00:06:57,400
me

111
00:06:57,400 --> 00:07:00,169
you live

112
00:07:00,169 --> 00:07:01,520
you

113
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:02,448
phone

114
00:07:02,449 --> 00:07:04,569
your own

115
00:07:04,569 --> 00:07:09,349
yeah

116
00:07:09,349 --> 00:07:13,770
low I will miss did men so why don't you
explain your involvement

117
00:07:13,770 --> 00:07:17,520
in a covert military project called
Project marigold

118
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:22,219
which on as I've been told is an anti
hacker can tell proactivity

119
00:07:22,219 --> 00:07:25,810
and while you're at it why don't you he

120
00:07:25,810 --> 00:07:29,289
you can speak you can

121
00:07:29,289 --> 00:07:32,990
you can get on in and you could speak or
why don't you wanna talk about where

122
00:07:32,990 --> 00:07:34,749
you're getting your funding for Pena

123
00:07:34,749 --> 00:07:39,940
me

124
00:07:39,940 --> 00:07:41,219
yes

125
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:45,860
yeah apparently I'm so we can see from
whites have been seen people are

126
00:07:45,860 --> 00:07:48,920
wondering how you're getting all these
points the president's

127
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:54,550
and not getting any money in on it yes

128
00:07:54,550 --> 00:07:56,020
leave

129
00:07:56,020 --> 00:07:57,680
the 1

130
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:58,560
on

131
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:02,169
yeah are look all

132
00:08:02,169 --> 00:08:04,139
the

133
00:08:04,139 --> 00:08:09,360
nationalizing I just they're always
depends if you want to talk about

134
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:12,699
the pump my head out what about you

135
00:08:12,699 --> 00:08:17,680
putting my hand lol system that you have
gained him I'm

136
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:18,950
prison

137
00:08:18,950 --> 00:08:22,610
I Hill the

138
00:08:22,610 --> 00:08:25,009
named

139
00:08:25,009 --> 00:08:26,409
I

140
00:08:26,409 --> 00:08:31,800
a so well why did you won't believe what
someone some head all

141
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:35,839
on a system that you did he do it seems
that you buy additional I had a

142
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:36,500
residence

143
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:41,510
and their room

144
00:08:41,510 --> 00:08:45,790
a Asia

145
00:08:45,790 --> 00:08:48,510
this

146
00:08:48,510 --> 00:08:51,520
this week in the neighborhood slightly

147
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:56,250
the please repeat the question as I was
speaking to someone else at the time

148
00:08:56,250 --> 00:08:59,370
this question whatever you just sent

149
00:08:59,370 --> 00:09:02,890
that what about you putting your hand on
my sis

150
00:09:02,890 --> 00:09:06,400
on the system that you hacked into that
we seem to be a violation pack your

151
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:07,560
ethics don't you think

152
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:11,710
mister I can always the room with me

153
00:09:11,710 --> 00:09:15,010
as we were it was pretty much just like
a joke

154
00:09:15,010 --> 00:09:18,480
and he was also present at a conference
prior to

155
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:22,300
and some other systems have been
violated in it was

156
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:26,140
trend as some others the same types of
things it was mostly just a big joke

157
00:09:26,140 --> 00:09:30,350
and there were three counts added to
this Rs 6,000

158
00:09:30,350 --> 00:09:33,920
and one was my handle which of course

159
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:38,689
and in haste I typed wrong in it instead
of coming up exe making not I X O M

160
00:09:38,690 --> 00:09:42,740
with the letter you and there was one by
the name of the conference that happen

161
00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:43,600
to be being held

162
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:47,710
which was punk on and of course mister
icons I

163
00:09:47,710 --> 00:09:52,090
the company that was involved with this
was Bob's stores which is just the

164
00:09:52,090 --> 00:09:53,700
retail chain in connecticut

165
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:58,000
and of course the attorney I X system
and with a nice announcement that said

166
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,750
welcome the Bob say I X in the version
number and stuff

167
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:05,300
in a non password in route account a

168
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:10,649
this company of course I'm along with
the district attorney I was facing ten

169
00:10:10,649 --> 00:10:15,360
felony counts including 34 juries
because mister thomas i cum

170
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:18,370
was the first person to be arrested at
this conference because you in an

171
00:10:18,370 --> 00:10:19,240
illegal weapon

172
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:23,190
and being military and that is within
the reserve

173
00:10:23,190 --> 00:10:27,209
I don't know if he still is and it's not
really relevant the military police said

174
00:10:27,209 --> 00:10:27,899
the comment

175
00:10:27,899 --> 00:10:31,120
and you know he added

176
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:35,829
he was pressured into talking about what
I had been doing when they entered the

177
00:10:35,829 --> 00:10:36,290
room

178
00:10:36,290 --> 00:10:42,250
blow ron is as i recall it you did put
my hand on the system

179
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:45,769
which is a violation above hacker ethics
neier know what you're trying to do

180
00:10:45,769 --> 00:10:49,360
because I shouldn't ask you to put my
system as far as me getting arrested for

181
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:50,200
illegal weapon

182
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:53,529
that never occurred you so

183
00:10:53,529 --> 00:10:57,220
0 is the reason that you were not
arrested because

184
00:10:57,220 --> 00:11:01,130
but the rollover the know that ever
occurred

185
00:11:01,130 --> 00:11:04,680
so then mister consider relevant can
this lol

186
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:08,990
the assistant district attorney for
Westchester County is in fact lying to

187
00:11:08,990 --> 00:11:09,500
me

188
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:14,020
in saying that you were going to be the
key witness anything that occurred

189
00:11:14,020 --> 00:11:17,100
between UN cancer leisure business and I
was not privy to it

190
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:21,490
the dodging the question I asked you

191
00:11:21,490 --> 00:11:24,660
if ken Citarella was lying to me

192
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:28,130
when he told me that you are going to be
the key witness

193
00:11:28,130 --> 00:11:31,540
in my trial for all I know he could have
been

194
00:11:31,540 --> 00:11:36,870
that okay

195
00:11:36,870 --> 00:11:40,240
all I don't know how to respond to that
one actually because this is really

196
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:40,810
weird

197
00:11:40,810 --> 00:11:45,480
what actually polls um you could try
leaving Ronnie

198
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:50,490
holes for those people excuse me excuse
me for those people that did see

199
00:11:50,490 --> 00:11:54,380
what happened earlier between Ste to
other people who stand

200
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:58,800
shall remain nameless and I'm not
pushing him I haven't hit him

201
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:03,449
I'm not a violent person I know he is in
himself by myself

202
00:12:03,449 --> 00:12:07,140
I'm on three years probation no big deal
I

203
00:12:07,140 --> 00:12:10,620
I had to pay a thousand dollars year

00:14:14,279 --> 00:14:17,500
the the tickets

242
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:20,960
okay but I'm does anyone have any
questions on paging systems

243
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:26,620
anything me the loan

244
00:14:26,620 --> 00:14:29,910

I yeah Adam if you care to waiting

246
00:14:33,530 --> 00:14:36,790
mono it's alright made

247
00:14:36,790 --> 00:14:39,980
I found in Kentucky up again on the

248
00:14:39,980 --> 00:14:43,620
frequency we can I do know the
demonstration of it

249
00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:45,720
on

250
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:48,110
the

251
00:14:48,110 --> 00:14:54,339
go ahead I and KGC sent me a touch-tone
code out and

252
00:14:54,339 --> 00:14:58,290
that weight my receiver of and now I
think he really has to say

253
00:14:58,290 --> 00:15:01,990
yeah I'm

254
00:15:01,990 --> 00:15:05,640
arm you could do it with the regular
scanner via touch-tone Dakota looked

255
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:06,189
into it

256
00:15:06,190 --> 00:15:13,190
this I'm using an amateur band
transceiver right now those have fun

257
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:14,829
built-in digital paging

258
00:15:14,829 --> 00:15:19,230
on you can use any type a receiver any
type a single in format you why

259
00:15:19,230 --> 00:15:22,600
that sees me

260
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:25,209
the world

261
00:15:25,209 --> 00:15:30,680
I was singling with two hand and
transceivers not go ahead

262
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:33,100
me

263
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:38,440
monkey it all depends now the system
we're using right now

264
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:42,240
has a range about five miles

265
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:45,910
on if you use more twirl using five
watts into

266
00:15:45,910 --> 00:15:49,870
a really low gain antenna if you use
more power bigger antenna

267
00:15:49,870 --> 00:15:53,070
if you could find a hammer peter that
has

268
00:15:53,070 --> 00:15:56,870
that passes touchdowns few them do
anymore it's a you not for the patch

269
00:15:56,870 --> 00:15:57,800
functions

270
00:15:57,800 --> 00:16:01,410
you can go seventy eighty miles any
problems go ahead

271
00:16:01,410 --> 00:16:06,600
nuns them

272
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:09,160
the loss yeah

273
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:11,170
something the mine life

274
00:16:11,170 --> 00:16:12,380
the mall

275
00:16:12,380 --> 00:16:17,490
he the well were once I am trying to
keep it simple cuz I don't know the

276
00:16:17,490 --> 00:16:21,020
you know have technically audiences I

277
00:16:21,020 --> 00:16:24,470
on your the

278
00:16:24,470 --> 00:16:29,410
the end well typically most that stuff
is done with frequency modulation

279
00:16:29,410 --> 00:16:33,709
because that's the standard for you VHF
and UHF with the pagers are at

280
00:16:33,710 --> 00:16:40,000
that the data format is sent in a f'n
FSK

281
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,410
in which the zeros and ones that binary
signal

282
00:16:43,410 --> 00:16:48,439
are the beach each d0 is represented by
one FM frequency

283
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:52,510
and then it shifted up a number still
hurts so already

284
00:16:52,510 --> 00:16:56,670
for the one on audio frequency shift key
which is another message use on the

285
00:16:56,670 --> 00:16:57,920
older pagers

286
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:01,730
it's done by audio tones went home
represents a one

287
00:17:01,730 --> 00:17:08,449
went on represents 0

288
00:17:08,449 --> 00:17:10,880
okay mission

289
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:11,930
in the ass the

290
00:17:11,930 --> 00:17:13,140
business

291
00:17:13,140 --> 00:17:16,640
he almost as standard formats that are
used for on

292
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:20,630
she your pod Sakhi which is the most
common format

293
00:17:20,630 --> 00:17:24,260
is ASCII data

294
00:17:24,260 --> 00:17:29,510
style let's see data sent in the any
standard data which is pod sac is sent

295
00:17:29,510 --> 00:17:30,320
in ASCII

296
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:34,809
on

297
00:17:34,809 --> 00:17:38,290
my you are there go ahead world

298
00:17:38,290 --> 00:17:44,340
on their three different rates da one is
512 bought the other is 1200 now they

299
00:17:44,340 --> 00:17:46,809
have a system that which is running a
2400 baud

300
00:17:46,809 --> 00:17:51,300
its slow compared to something out most
people aren't using not modems over the

301
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:54,050
land lines running it 28-14 for

302
00:17:54,050 --> 00:17:57,500
its RS and it's only 12 characters for a

303
00:17:57,500 --> 00:18:02,640
numeric display pagers so you're really
a lot speed

304
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:07,679
are they do other basic parity check but
that's it

305
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:14,250
go ahead

306
00:18:14,250 --> 00:18:15,660
the

307
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:18,690
my which I was security systems are
built into

308
00:18:18,690 --> 00:18:23,690
the prom on a Motorola adviser on

309
00:18:23,690 --> 00:18:27,630
there are none there's no need for it on
the EE from

310
00:18:27,630 --> 00:18:32,850
is set up the through a programmer I
which is hooked into your PC

311
00:18:32,850 --> 00:18:37,570
and there is no there's no security just
programming at the cathode

312
00:18:37,570 --> 00:18:40,720
you can very easily clone a pager

313
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:44,340
I if you have you know if you have a
