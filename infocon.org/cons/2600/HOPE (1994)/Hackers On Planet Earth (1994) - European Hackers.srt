every we discuss or programs open

88
00:05:40,790 --> 00:05:46,980

89
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:50,190
don't talk about it so we have only one
change to

to take all informations to reflect this
information

91
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:56,420

169
00:11:06,530 --> 00:11:11,270

think she went into the net

170
00:11:11,270 --> 00:11:15,040
heard some 980 428 e 8718

171
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:19,300
Asia and we didn't know exactly what's
happened we have pizza and pulleys

172
00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:20,770
papers later to

173
00:11:20,770 --> 00:11:24,530
but as you know your best friend is
working for the KGB answers

174
00:11:24,530 --> 00:11:27,949
big surprise I so as

175
00:11:27,949 --> 00:11:33,910
yes to job mister from use radio station
want to make a big story

176
00:11:33,910 --> 00:11:37,719
at all it's her turn about us hanging
Eric

177
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:41,570
or all the KGB up there was there was
coming

178
00:11:41,570 --> 00:11:45,250
a long day any mind to leave people on

179
00:11:45,250 --> 00:11:50,570
how holiday in their wallets got himself
with the optional way

180
00:11:50,570 --> 00:11:54,589
up so we have a lot of for we didn't

181
00:11:54,589 --> 00:11:59,230
believe it so they love informations
that they want to know how to make a

182
00:11:59,230 --> 00:12:03,430
a great arm hangs a yes the same time as

183
00:12:03,430 --> 00:12:07,370
measured by how much of constant Jeremy
so they ease

184
00:12:07,370 --> 00:12:12,050
germans so one to you free from the
Russians and their own polling take

185
00:12:12,050 --> 00:12:15,360
with him so I think so I are true but up

186
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:18,650
there no for background information

187
00:12:18,650 --> 00:12:22,110
that is possible that this was a
political ad

188
00:12:22,110 --> 00:12:26,370
that the story most during under the
table

189
00:12:26,370 --> 00:12:29,620
so we're just or we have to program

190
00:12:29,620 --> 00:12:33,579
that so we get informations that one of
their

191
00:12:33,579 --> 00:12:37,810
other room members of the case computer
homers and spy

192
00:12:37,810 --> 00:12:41,290
by the German Secret Service to and

193
00:12:41,290 --> 00:12:44,449
there's no hard paranoia into the chaos
computer

194
00:12:44,449 --> 00:12:50,150
up nobody trusts the other review great
program for us so we have meet

195
00:12:50,150 --> 00:12:54,130
52 5 years that we can work now and is

196
00:12:54,130 --> 00:12:58,300
today it's so that we have to trust
program to by somebody

197
00:12:58,300 --> 00:13:03,310
that will that change their home where
the home work okays Computer Club

227
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:54,240
what's appealing or us is that ever

228
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:58,220
so long as technical the home and who is
going on

229
00:14:58,220 --> 00:15:02,280

00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:06,000
Sr eat lol who not for us

231
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,520
much mention of mutation oh and she will
bring him

232
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:12,579
good and bad things and it says social

233
00:15:12,579 --> 00:15:16,370
a.m. IRAs is a public responsibility

234
00:15:16,370 --> 00:15:20,240
to give this information to other people
so that they can learn

235
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:23,240
22 %um I'll better roads

236
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:27,920
in this way at we have also learned that
sir

237
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:32,510
that we have only one protection against
secret services and this

238
00:15:32,510 --> 00:15:37,069
that's as powerfully working to give a
lot of informations to public

239
00:15:37,069 --> 00:15:40,390
there that that the people know what
happened

240
00:15:40,390 --> 00:15:45,000
in the first time it was very different
people all I hey what did he do

241
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:49,250
%uh everybody has a different way live
you like to keep alive

242
00:15:49,250 --> 00:15:52,420
that his pictures are probably didn't
like computers

243
00:15:52,420 --> 00:15:55,809
all they are afraid to ask shooters are

244
00:15:55,809 --> 00:16:01,010
they daylight the feeling of David
against going up so that we have a

245
00:16:01,010 --> 00:16:06,250
was on very little roommate so much
activity is

246
00:16:06,250 --> 00:16:11,079
again at the wrongly hi his better only
SECC

247
00:16:11,079 --> 00:16:16,579
never have given a.m. wrong informations
to the newspapers

248
00:16:16,579 --> 00:16:21,040
probably and solid CCC today is a a
knowledge

249
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:25,150
organization the people I asked us if
they have problems

250
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:29,420
so lot of people coming to us with
consumer programs the telephone bill is

251
00:16:29,420 --> 00:16:31,420
too high they have problems with the
credit

252
00:16:31,420 --> 00:16:34,569
%uh the bank card so if there's nobody
here

253
00:16:34,569 --> 00:16:38,480
and Pam I love them and then they are
awesome Collins number

254
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:42,689
of the key is computer stuff so we have
a lot of address so the social technical

255
00:16:42,689 --> 00:16:43,959
programs

256
00:16:43,959 --> 00:16:48,040
and all sometimes we have no koi defend
the

257
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:52,240
lawyer they can hold so

258
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:57,280
the last Thursday's I can say army years
I have seen you know a lot of people who

259
00:16:57,280 --> 00:17:02,360
has interpreted to have branded paranoia
and secret services

260
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:05,480
and I think it's the wrong way if you
don't

261
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:09,189
or through long to our in the dark

262
00:17:09,189 --> 00:17:12,189
you lost a game before you start

263
00:17:12,189 --> 00:17:17,790
you have to work I and yeah information
to the public that people know what's

264
00:17:17,790 --> 00:17:18,709
happened

265
00:17:18,709 --> 00:17:22,780
so and if you going and every time you
have the power on my head and secret

266
00:17:22,780 --> 00:17:24,839
services into your brain you will be

267
00:17:24,839 --> 00:17:30,120
killin crazy pocket it's not a very nice
way to live

268
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:37,120
okay the my car

269
00:17:40,190 --> 00:17:45,400
like layin you look at the your
understanding of like it

270
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:48,480
so because many many people still think
we are

271
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:53,500
I'm kinda technical hey man %uh and then
they did a lot from

272
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:58,720
many things on it when using 10 minutes
mara technical John Wright think about

273
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:02,070
a regions where it is and how technology
is working

274
00:18:02,070 --> 00:18:05,200
that with you in on a dirty dozen

275
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:08,690
90-86 since we have a login computer

276
00:18:08,690 --> 00:18:13,260
being going on in germ packing I we
changed it up

277
00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:16,590
decision from having with to some kinda
all

278
00:18:16,590 --> 00:18:20,559
where are we is you didn't mention the
based in charge is a

279
00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:23,730
information technology use the bed me
know

280
00:18:23,730 --> 00:18:26,990
special I'll build was a information
should do

281
00:18:26,990 --> 00:18:31,540
gray in the haitian doo-doo should be
accessible to everyone

282
00:18:31,540 --> 00:18:34,750
%uh political Aamina telecommunication

283
00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:38,309
prizes up little private things like
that

284
00:18:38,309 --> 00:18:41,510
and Beltway eight are I think a little
bit more on the

285
00:18:41,510 --> 00:18:45,760
those old at a field is technology and
on the technical

286
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:49,379
or are always having a technical term

287
00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:53,490

but you his answer that only a very few
companies

387
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:11,270
you

388
00:25:11,270 --> 00:25:16,009
side

389
00:25:16,009 --> 00:25:19,820
up to 250 registered members in about

390
00:25:19,820 --> 00:25:23,149
doesn't tubes run is a magazine %uh

391
00:25:23,149 --> 00:25:27,629
is no it does not they'll %uh a how many
people there are

392
00:25:27,629 --> 00:25:31,779
because thing is that members as only
mean that hey

393
00:25:31,779 --> 00:25:34,789
does not mean a daily wearing a

394
00:25:34,789 --> 00:25:41,059
a hole in it I mean other than 700
people

395
00:25:41,059 --> 00:25:48,059
and this so God golf group of the family

396
00:25:50,350 --> 00:25:57,350
and

397
00:26:02,559 --> 00:26:07,700
I and

398
00:26:07,700 --> 00:26:13,210
I yeah heart knows and and and the right

399
00:26:13,210 --> 00:26:17,720
rating have been concerned I think that
would be more loving

400
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:20,880
this yes I think there could be other

401
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:24,000
as big mention for example in your bed
delivered

402
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:27,210
of the I see in american society here

403
00:26:27,210 --> 00:26:31,000
many more your he landed in Germany
leader

404
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:34,260
people that use have it both ways for
example really well

405
00:26:34,260 --> 00:26:37,559
they don't have the money for us is more
the

406
00:26:37,559 --> 00:26:40,860
movies having fun not so much reading

407
00:26:40,860 --> 00:26:44,799
having no money and they get a ticket to
technology because

408
00:26:44,799 --> 00:26:49,049
that out of the way like you you know
they could be more just doesn't give

409
00:26:49,049 --> 00:26:52,110
for example what I use a special trade

410
00:26:52,110 --> 00:26:55,110
do you spell useful radio for much
cheaper

411
00:26:55,110 --> 00:26:59,830

between animals and humans and that

412
00:26:59,830 --> 00:27:01,750
humans can communicate in

413
00:27:01,750 --> 00:27:06,799

00:32:44,770 --> 00:32:49,280
my tell you social you're doing out in
Amsterdam Holland

506
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:54,030
acting kiss started outside magazine %uh
charges a glove missus

507
00:32:54,030 --> 00:32:59,120
show you what I acted like this

508
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:02,580
excellence in the back issues have to be
for sale look at later

509
00:33:02,580 --> 00:33:06,140
and which is like this magazine

510
00:33:06,140 --> 00:33:10,500
not unlike 2600 okay to what the
differences are later

511
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:13,700
yeah a little bit more I'm

512
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:18,590
time in our history tactic started back
in 1989

513
00:33:18,590 --> 00:33:23,060
I at that time there was a group people

514
00:33:23,060 --> 00:33:26,700
it felt there was a large discrepancy

515
00:33:26,700 --> 00:33:29,810
between people were led to believe about
technology in which

516
00:33:29,810 --> 00:33:34,230
and the things that we got to the action
julie is here and breaking into computer

517
00:33:34,230 --> 00:33:35,700
systems we were finding that

518
00:33:35,700 --> 00:33:39,640
there was hardly any security computer
systems that we came across a usually

519
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:40,460
flakey

520
00:33:40,460 --> 00:33:43,480
the people that are running them didn't
know what they were talking about

521
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:49,200
I never the days at networking which is
beginning in 1989

522
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:54,030
I and the people of raising the networks
have no idea what they were talking

523
00:33:54,030 --> 00:33:54,470
about

524
00:33:54,470 --> 00:33:57,710
we on we found this to be true almost
anywhere

525
00:33:57,710 --> 00:34:01,360
yet people were led to believe that it
was all function perfectly in and

526
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:05,470
you can turn on your TV or some company
was saying that they all had it down it

527
00:34:05,470 --> 00:34:08,230
worked perfectly and it was absolutely
no problem whatsoever

528
00:34:08,230 --> 00:34:11,719
we saw a lot of problems to solve
problems ok I

529
00:34:11,720 --> 00:34:16,770
people not having access to this new
technology information not being share

530
00:34:16,770 --> 00:34:20,590
people that you have access to it we
don't have a security

531
00:34:20,590 --> 00:34:23,770
people having their data in computers
and trusting these

532
00:34:23,770 --> 00:34:27,820
his computers and his government
agencies in hospitals and everything

533
00:34:27,820 --> 00:34:32,629
with your data when it was very possible
for other people to break into it

534
00:34:32,629 --> 00:34:36,089
and we'll also saw subculture people
that

535
00:34:36,090 --> 00:34:39,429
understood the risks and was having fun

536
00:34:39,429 --> 00:34:42,950
breaking into computer systems and
telling each other about these Christian

537
00:34:42,949 --> 00:34:46,158
I was really developing a bill yeah

538
00:34:46,159 --> 00:34:49,440
underground information network to share
this information

539
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:53,168
I'm we decided you that he's

540
00:34:53,168 --> 00:34:56,440
people have their own magazine their own
voice because

541
00:34:56,440 --> 00:35:00,540
I actors tend to be very paranoid for
for good reason the

542
00:35:00,540 --> 00:35:04,090
are prosecuted in some countries and

543
00:35:04,090 --> 00:35:07,680
they don't get jobs anymore once
companies know that you're involved as

544
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:12,009
people so I just didn't believe her
which makes it difficult for the press

545
00:35:12,010 --> 00:35:15,760
and for the public at large to get a

546
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:18,840
coherent body shot hackers to get a
coherent

547
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:22,640
opinion out and so we decided to have

548
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:25,839
essential point for looking regime
together and

549
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:29,010
publish a magazine from there I'm

550
00:35:29,010 --> 00:35:32,390
in 1989 he also hosted together with her
T-cell

551
00:35:32,390 --> 00:35:35,520
a the cultural center in Amsterdam

552
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:39,310
and also music singer very well-known we
hosted the

553
00:35:39,310 --> 00:35:45,120
galactic actor party I it was an
international conference where

554
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:48,480
akers from all over Europe in action all
over the world

555
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:52,200
me to get together and discuss political
issues

556
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:55,350
endeavors what are the first meetings
where

557
00:35:55,350 --> 00:35:59,350
hackers from all over the world start
discussing making information

558
00:35:59,350 --> 00:36:04,130
3 getting information out there I'm

559
00:36:04,130 --> 00:36:10,170
know so 1 I'm one of the things we see
as are all those publishing

560
00:36:10,170 --> 00:36:14,690
things that I had a phone company or
large computer corporations or

561
00:36:14,690 --> 00:36:15,610
governments

562
00:36:15,610 --> 00:36:18,690
do to control people or to keep tabs on
them

563
00:36:18,690 --> 00:36:22,880
and expose what they're doing exposed to
real technical facts

564
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:26,360
I can give is your job was it that at

565
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:29,700
when I think the best example is I'm

566
00:36:29,700 --> 00:36:34,150
happy new year ago there's a very
well-known corrugation Holland

567
00:36:34,150 --> 00:36:38,810
where a large ecstasy hang is being
prosecuted on

568
00:36:38,810 --> 00:36:43,390
I on phone taps on wiretaps from all the
whole of the house

569
00:36:43,390 --> 00:36:46,779
because these these heard people worse

570
00:36:46,780 --> 00:36:50,380
responding cell phones with each other
and with other people and

571
00:36:50,380 --> 00:36:55,210
someone's we're going all over the place
is very hard for the government to get

572
00:36:55,210 --> 00:36:59,360
wiretaps on each fall everything is the
government at that time didn't really

573
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:01,740
have the possibility to our tap into

574
00:37:01,740 --> 00:37:05,060
the central office for a phone call so I
don't know

575
00:37:05,060 --> 00:37:08,870
just so instead they decided to to build
a radio scanner

576
00:37:08,870 --> 00:37:12,900
any ad hoc a tape recorder update and
add there's a special service

577
00:37:12,900 --> 00:37:16,380
circuitry I have a radio scattershot

578
00:37:16,380 --> 00:37:20,510
all the cell phone calls that are close
to it and then on the change the filter

579
00:37:20,510 --> 00:37:21,950
out calls me that he's

580
00:37:21,950 --> 00:37:25,700
criminals at with him on tape and use it
as evidence

581
00:37:25,700 --> 00:37:28,910
and we brew to

582
00:37:28,910 --> 00:37:32,500
to the court and through the press also
to the people

583
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:36,070
to prove that this was not the way to do
it because they musta been talking

584
00:37:36,070 --> 00:37:38,290
hundreds if not thousands of other
people

585
00:37:38,290 --> 00:37:41,850
we prove that this is not however
michiko about

586
00:37:41,850 --> 00:37:46,480
catching criminals I that case is still
important there

587
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:49,760
there's now an appeal pending so we
don't know what's going to happen

588
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:53,960
but the thing is nobody until we can run
nobody

589
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:57,160
question what the phone company that we
switching else as well

590
00:37:57,160 --> 00:38:01,270
you just tap these criminals using this
radio scanner and it takes

591
00:38:01,270 --> 00:38:04,950
hacker why it takes a few actors out
there showing

592
00:38:04,950 --> 00:38:08,310
can just have one on just a scattering a
tape recorder

593
00:38:08,310 --> 00:38:12,549
you have to listen to all these then
some hearing arguing that so they must

594
00:38:12,550 --> 00:38:16,720
be tapping everybody and by asking the
right questions we got to admit that

595
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:20,590
there's another good example where

596
00:38:20,590 --> 00:38:23,720
I the touch phone company

597
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:28,000
this is really funny that I the Dutch
phone company at one point

598
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:33,190
a was charged a that it was possible
through their standard telephone we have

599
00:38:33,190 --> 00:38:35,140
a standard telephone how much like me

600
00:38:35,140 --> 00:38:38,310
the all standard telephone that was used
here

601
00:38:38,310 --> 00:38:41,930
so your own laundry production there's
hope g65

602
00:38:41,930 --> 00:38:45,720
and somebody I found out that you could

603
00:38:45,720 --> 00:38:48,750
through the g60 I have letter to your
cell

604
00:38:48,750 --> 00:38:52,560
through the 265 you could listen to
conversations in a room even if the

605
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:53,850
phone was on hold

606
00:38:53,850 --> 00:38:56,890
if you have access to their Walmart

607
00:38:56,890 --> 00:39:00,379
I we publish that and even he'd

608
00:39:00,380 --> 00:39:04,680
just did you demonstrated my own company
tonight United everything is it knows no

609
00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:06,270
we cannot do that

610
00:39:06,270 --> 00:39:09,640
you can't listen to on causation student
wired

611
00:39:09,640 --> 00:39:14,330
receivers on the boat so up especially
the home but also some other people

612
00:39:14,330 --> 00:39:15,440
spend some time

613
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:18,530
actually building the device and we can
show people look

614
00:39:18,530 --> 00:39:23,610
you can do it here it is and even though
they did make it happen without us

615
00:39:23,610 --> 00:39:26,790
the debate on this it would have been
inconclusive because nobody would have

616
00:39:26,790 --> 00:39:27,920
had

617
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:34,140
mind the knowledge in the phone system
to actually build the device

618
00:39:34,140 --> 00:39:37,640
so I'm just going to have some some
useful things about what

619
00:39:37,640 --> 00:39:42,629
how hacking knowledge useful are having
knowledge in the society

620
00:39:42,630 --> 00:39:46,780
people that don't know about telephone
systems computers telecommunications

621
00:39:46,780 --> 00:39:50,470
and not working for the government and
not working for major corporations

622
00:39:50,470 --> 00:39:55,630
so they can open their mouths something
goes wrong tell side what's going on

623
00:39:55,630 --> 00:39:59,910
not working I'm

624
00:39:59,910 --> 00:40:04,399
together with that of course and that's
also enacted a lot of articles are about

625
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:04,930
that

626
00:40:04,930 --> 00:40:08,299
together with that comes a
responsibility for

627
00:40:08,300 --> 00:40:12,810
akers actors are what her young people

628
00:40:12,810 --> 00:40:16,680
no actors no thirteen-years-old and

629
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:20,210
I think teaching people to hack is like
AG people karate

630
00:40:20,210 --> 00:40:25,090
you after GJ responsibility along with
the

631
00:40:25,090 --> 00:40:29,200
with knowledge you can teach people how
to break into computer systems but you

632
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:30,950
also have to teach in

633
00:40:30,950 --> 00:40:35,040
is probably not going to do this and
destroy computer systems

634
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:39,750
it's not true to erase other people's
work it's not going to

635
00:40:39,750 --> 00:40:42,920
I had a people's privacy so

636
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:47,160
it's very important I K sausage people
what not to do with this new

637
00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:51,779
I'll knowledge is not about power that
they have

638
00:40:51,780 --> 00:40:55,530
I'm what should I talk about los done

639
00:40:55,530 --> 00:40:59,920
I then 1992 came a long way

640
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:03,740
and 1991 and

641
00:41:03,740 --> 00:41:08,090
it really started in 45 hackers were
gate of internet system that

642
00:41:08,090 --> 00:41:12,180
someone had legal counsel and others for
hacking into

643
00:41:12,180 --> 00:41:16,250
and 45 people found themselves out any
internet access

644
00:41:16,250 --> 00:41:20,000
injured at that time all it did not have
a public access provided

645
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:23,640
there was nobody offering in genetics at
to major corporations and universities

646
00:41:23,640 --> 00:41:24,500
for

647
00:41:24,500 --> 00:41:28,500
thousand dollars a month and he didn't
like that you can always get mail issues

648
00:41:28,500 --> 00:41:30,370
but not the online

649
00:41:30,370 --> 00:41:33,670
access even made news repeatedly
expensive

650
00:41:33,670 --> 00:41:37,250
I'll so you say to yourself and Shelby

651
00:41:37,250 --> 00:41:40,350
engine provider called access for all

652
00:41:40,350 --> 00:41:43,359
should excess already lol

653
00:41:43,359 --> 00:41:48,600
I'm that are really popular real fast
even though the agent community

654
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:51,890
problem I added you cuz that's all

655
00:41:51,890 --> 00:41:55,480
this is weird akers the great use our
computer systems and kicking off our

656
00:41:55,480 --> 00:41:57,440
computer systems the

657
00:41:57,440 --> 00:42:02,100
I housing become our neighbors I'm

658
00:42:02,100 --> 00:42:05,570
so you there goes the neighborhood yeah

659
00:42:05,570 --> 00:42:09,770
I'm but since we were the only internet
provider and he said

660
00:42:09,770 --> 00:42:13,220
cost for internet access in Holland he
really knows a nobody

661
00:42:13,220 --> 00:42:16,250
pretty much nobody felt like a meeting
with us

662
00:42:16,250 --> 00:42:19,960
always very well known and famous people
that happen not to be waiting for you to

663
00:42:19,960 --> 00:42:22,420
burst your major corporation recently
having

664
00:42:22,420 --> 00:42:25,500
don't have to go to hell in your email
address

665
00:42:25,500 --> 00:42:29,490
and evenly head of me of the Dutch a

666
00:42:29,490 --> 00:42:32,660
police force that Jesus high-tech
criminals

667
00:42:32,660 --> 00:42:39,180
is actually know as reach at CR I dot
hack it doesn't help

668
00:42:39,180 --> 00:42:42,910
so we were we have a public access
service that was much wider than the

669
00:42:42,910 --> 00:42:44,149
hacker community very

670
00:42:44,150 --> 00:42:47,520
putting people on the internet and
others other providers for

671
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:50,589
for here we were the only ones

672
00:42:50,589 --> 00:42:54,190
I'm that gave that revision real close

673
00:42:54,190 --> 00:42:58,080
real was because we had a really good
eventually started

674
00:42:58,080 --> 00:43:01,120
people sizes the right now it's fighting
the system

675
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:04,220
all this very good finally some people
that can do something about big

676
00:43:04,220 --> 00:43:05,830
corporations story my

677
00:43:05,830 --> 00:43:10,810
yeah and then the government have to
question the new computer crime laws

678
00:43:10,810 --> 00:43:15,910
because it pressure exerted on them from
Germany and from the United States

679
00:43:15,910 --> 00:43:19,960
at so all this bad publicity happened
about how much you can I

680
00:43:19,960 --> 00:43:25,080
yeah I checkers were doing to such
companies

681
00:43:25,080 --> 00:43:29,339
and for a while hacker image was really

682
00:43:29,339 --> 00:43:32,190
fairly grim hackers are people that
broke into computer systems in

683
00:43:32,190 --> 00:43:34,230
Proceedings

684
00:43:34,230 --> 00:43:38,960
didn't do any good at all this setting
up access for all

685
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:43,060
has really helped us in breaking open
situation

686
00:43:43,060 --> 00:43:46,410
creating new images actors even though
the same people that shit up

687
00:43:46,410 --> 00:43:50,899
access for all are still involved in
breaking security and and

688
00:43:50,900 --> 00:43:55,609
seeing what's up there and how it's
hackable

689
00:43:55,609 --> 00:43:59,810
I'm no sorry nice hey cutie in the
universe

690
00:43:59,810 --> 00:44:03,029
in a nineteen eighty-three summer last
year which is it

691
00:44:03,030 --> 00:44:06,630
convention I like this one except that
we had

692
00:44:06,630 --> 00:44:10,270
headed out in tents and I have site

693
00:44:10,270 --> 00:44:14,230
middle of nowhere I'm responded last

694
00:44:14,230 --> 00:44:17,710
free agent this there's a lot of people
coming together in a pirate radio

695
00:44:17,710 --> 00:44:18,790
station

696
00:44:18,790 --> 00:44:23,100
a a network on the engine in it

697
00:44:23,100 --> 00:44:26,420
workshops all happen simultaneously but
also

698
00:44:26,420 --> 00:44:30,210
ending Oct oriented I'm

699
00:44:30,210 --> 00:44:33,870
as a lot of fun and one of the ideas
that came out and i cant universe was to

700
00:44:33,870 --> 00:44:34,730
sell

701
00:44:34,730 --> 00:44:37,760
the digital city which is a free at your
operating

702
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:42,190
abscam digital city now has forty Mon
choked up to it

703
00:44:42,190 --> 00:44:46,280
it is an workstation as writing software
that allows people to communicate with

704
00:44:46,280 --> 00:44:46,650
each other

705
00:44:46,650 --> 00:44:51,650
you easily a Jos a city metaphors you
can actually walk around the streets

706
00:44:51,650 --> 00:44:55,070
and do things meet each other

707
00:44:55,070 --> 00:44:59,030
I'm it is really shitty

708
00:44:59,030 --> 00:45:02,390
I'm jury it still going

709
00:45:02,390 --> 00:45:05,580
its its internet addresses DBS

710
00:45:05,580 --> 00:45:08,720
at yeah DDS not acting the hotel

711
00:45:08,720 --> 00:45:12,270
you can tell it hostage in Dutch Shell

712
00:45:12,270 --> 00:45:16,420
although we're working on a final
version

713
00:45:16,420 --> 00:45:23,420
my now %uh

714
00:45:24,369 --> 00:45:28,239
DES old I'll see it later he and his
office number

715
00:45:28,239 --> 00:45:35,239
dresses I'd like to get people's I
digital city in the beginning was

716
00:45:35,410 --> 00:45:37,239
sponsored by the City Amsterdam

717
00:45:37,239 --> 00:45:41,839
because they were putting their public
information on there still are

718
00:45:41,839 --> 00:45:44,940
also still sergeant-at-arms number
they're putting

719
00:45:44,940 --> 00:45:48,400
all the city documents today have

720
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:52,319
the like it transcripts from all the
city council meetings

721
00:45:52,319 --> 00:45:56,359
I all the public information like at
what time business

722
00:45:56,359 --> 00:45:59,589
city swimming pool and said it out open
and close

723
00:45:59,589 --> 00:46:04,200
from the most modern stuff to the mail
addresses all the politicians everything

724
00:46:04,200 --> 00:46:09,059
that saw in the digital city right now
the digital city is also seeking money

725
00:46:09,059 --> 00:46:12,239
from the Ministry of Economic Affairs in
Holland and from

726
00:46:12,239 --> 00:46:15,359
I think the Ministry Cultural Affairs
and we're

727
00:46:15,359 --> 00:46:18,700
looking for Russian Ministry of
Education

728
00:46:18,700 --> 00:46:22,630
so we're actually a government official
think now

729
00:46:22,630 --> 00:46:28,349
there's actors now setting up digital
city together I should mention with the

730
00:46:28,349 --> 00:46:31,759
Cultural Center do I install which is
also participating

731
00:46:31,759 --> 00:46:37,190
and we're really working on getting
information out to the people there's

732
00:46:37,190 --> 00:46:38,529
really a lot hackers

733
00:46:38,529 --> 00:46:42,400
they're putting are to their energy into
making the system work

734
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:47,979
I'll shows a touch the issue of security
on me

735
00:46:47,979 --> 00:46:52,079
acting systems is we have people
bringing to access for all

736
00:46:52,079 --> 00:46:56,089
back through time we had people break
into the digital city of

737
00:46:56,089 --> 00:47:00,180
we're getting people have been here
three axis tell us how did

738
00:47:00,180 --> 00:47:04,368
and and thats

739
00:47:04,369 --> 00:47:08,769
may access for all I think one of the
most secure systems on the engine

740
00:47:08,769 --> 00:47:12,019
because everybody wants he majored in
art thing

741
00:47:12,019 --> 00:47:16,219
there's people that happened four times
people have have acted only one sick

742
00:47:16,219 --> 00:47:17,719
people have group three times

743
00:47:17,719 --> 00:47:21,059
you get to be in writing on the security
out where they can advise on

744
00:47:21,059 --> 00:47:24,670
making I just brought more secure so

745
00:47:24,670 --> 00:47:29,380
thats even over setting up a really
legitimate public access

746
00:47:29,380 --> 00:47:33,430
internet unique site we're still trying
to prove to people that communicating

747
00:47:33,430 --> 00:47:35,669
with actors in using their skills and
knowledge

748
00:47:35,670 --> 00:47:39,640
to me just a more secure is a much more
sensible approach

749
00:47:39,640 --> 00:47:43,150
then trying to send the FBI after them

750
00:47:43,150 --> 00:47:46,469
and not doing anything about your system
security

751
00:47:46,469 --> 00:47:50,869
but it's an ongoing battle units will
never be secure systems will never be

752
00:47:50,869 --> 00:47:51,489
secure

753
00:47:51,489 --> 00:47:56,369
that's we'll see what happens I'm

754
00:47:56,369 --> 00:48:00,329
after that a the government tried to

755
00:48:00,329 --> 00:48:04,180
eat meat project for poverty else no
horns illegal

756
00:48:04,180 --> 00:48:08,069
really shot I'll came out of the blue a

757
00:48:08,069 --> 00:48:11,200
because criminals are using photography

758
00:48:11,200 --> 00:48:14,989
for college be totally illegal was the
basic idea of the law

759
00:48:14,989 --> 00:48:19,940
misinterpretation whatever they were
trying to do that call a paper clip for

760
00:48:19,940 --> 00:48:24,690
here and you're trying to get everybody
to register their publication in the

761
00:48:24,690 --> 00:48:25,349
government

762
00:48:25,349 --> 00:48:29,640
say they have liquor without having the
actual hardware just have everybody

763
00:48:29,640 --> 00:48:33,618
oh he and register somewhere which is

764
00:48:33,619 --> 00:48:37,509
really funny idea actually crazy and

765
00:48:37,509 --> 00:48:41,789
that has of course we were very much
against it from the very beginning thats

766
00:48:41,789 --> 00:48:45,140
that was to be expected but it's also
true in Holland

767
00:48:45,140 --> 00:48:48,440
a movement that people that suddenly
woke up today this is

768
00:48:48,440 --> 00:48:53,349
possible I can be happening have which
hasn't really good press

769
00:48:53,349 --> 00:48:56,420
Anders there's no actual movement

770
00:48:56,420 --> 00:49:01,489
people against this type of law working
on understanding of these issues and and

771
00:49:01,489 --> 00:49:04,539
impact of technology and back to his new
laws

772
00:49:04,539 --> 00:49:08,029
movement is much wider than the actual
user did

773
00:49:08,029 --> 00:49:14,620
you

774
00:49:14,620 --> 00:49:18,839
I'm so that's that's really good at that

775
00:49:18,840 --> 00:49:23,280
even though the law did not go through
this time he will come back at it again

776
00:49:23,280 --> 00:49:26,970
but because they major just push it to
the first time

777
00:49:26,970 --> 00:49:30,000
there's a movement going to people are
watching out for

778
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:34,180
years and infrastructure radio people
are willing to fight his lawyers

779
00:49:34,180 --> 00:49:38,040
I ish even politicians people there good
lobbying

780
00:49:38,040 --> 00:49:42,590
not just attackers anymore that's very
I'm

781
00:49:42,590 --> 00:49:46,260
well should be talking about %uh

782
00:49:46,260 --> 00:49:50,340
what he has to school because it's
almost new acting I don't have an issue

783
00:49:50,340 --> 00:49:51,070
with me

784
00:49:51,070 --> 00:49:55,870
is about to hit the newsstands and be
happy greet me just purchased a mess

785
00:49:55,870 --> 00:50:00,080
i holla it's it's I think it's a
pan-european system the Germans have to

786
00:50:00,080 --> 00:50:01,090
do

787
00:50:01,090 --> 00:50:07,840
it no no no it's the same system to
Jakarta repaint system

788
00:50:07,840 --> 00:50:12,720
and I we had this system and we build a
program for the PC that

789
00:50:12,720 --> 00:50:15,790
does an annual a shadow over the
Bridgeport so

790
00:50:15,790 --> 00:50:20,330
your PC can reach into the gym hard out
all other countries in Europe

791
00:50:20,330 --> 00:50:25,560
has nasty plastic goal after the acustic
artificial plastic flow

792
00:50:25,560 --> 00:50:30,390
a door that poses the ID card I did not
show up on where you can still touch the

793
00:50:30,390 --> 00:50:31,850
car while it's actually

794
00:50:31,850 --> 00:50:36,779
legit this is because the Dutch
apparently they don't just machines to

795
00:50:36,780 --> 00:50:39,170
take your heart

796
00:50:39,170 --> 00:50:42,200
solved I'll

797
00:50:42,200 --> 00:50:45,549
seeming welding bridge apparently too
thin %uh

798
00:50:45,549 --> 00:50:48,900
so that's so even though we're

799
00:50:48,900 --> 00:50:52,630
we're working on I'm giving people
access to the internet and we're doing

800
00:50:52,630 --> 00:50:53,180
all these

801
00:50:53,180 --> 00:50:56,578
I Lucy the mainstream up route

802
00:50:56,579 --> 00:50:59,890
things we're still working it's a new
piece of technology comes out

803
00:50:59,890 --> 00:51:04,038
and phone companies or other
organizations are claiming that is

804
00:51:04,039 --> 00:51:05,529
really really secure

805
00:51:05,529 --> 00:51:09,549
we still go out and she really is secure
we still go out and find out what

806
00:51:09,549 --> 00:51:10,170
happened

807
00:51:10,170 --> 00:51:13,849
so this we're keeping that knowledge
alive as well

808
00:51:13,849 --> 00:51:17,680
is it is important at god forbid if
things ever

809
00:51:17,680 --> 00:51:20,900
long it this society ever

810
00:51:20,900 --> 00:51:25,460
all sorts JL to Rs initiate

811
00:51:25,460 --> 00:51:29,319
and we're going to need people that know
how to break into computer systems that

812
00:51:29,319 --> 00:51:33,308
know how to server technology because of
this beautiful technology is being set

813
00:51:33,309 --> 00:51:34,670
up around us today

814
00:51:34,670 --> 00:51:38,289
could be used against and

815
00:51:38,289 --> 00:51:42,539
it is we're going to need as many people
as possible to understand how it works

816
00:51:42,539 --> 00:51:45,999
you don't have to go on the streets and
add

817
00:51:45,999 --> 00:51:49,509
home sold homes today as well as a
behind K

818
00:51:49,509 --> 00:51:52,660
to understand how this technology work
at the mindset

819
00:51:52,660 --> 00:51:57,078
do not sit there and see how its
technology

820
00:51:57,079 --> 00:52:00,609
Headley I is there is scary things
happening

821
00:52:00,609 --> 00:52:05,109
governments all over the world are
working on registering our every move

822
00:52:05,109 --> 00:52:08,739
there's no bosses that you can hook up
to a video camera have

823
00:52:08,739 --> 00:52:13,390
video import on one side and then
license plates come out she really on

824
00:52:13,390 --> 00:52:13,900
others

825
00:52:13,900 --> 00:52:17,079
there's there's

826
00:52:17,079 --> 00:52:21,369
interesting device is being made to
enable governments to control what I

827
00:52:21,369 --> 00:52:25,259
what we are doing as I was saying
senator also being tracked down by 100

828
00:52:25,259 --> 00:52:26,460
or 200 meters now

829
00:52:26,460 --> 00:52:29,499
if you try to make call with the new
digital systems

830
00:52:29,499 --> 00:52:33,499
government assured

831
00:52:33,499 --> 00:52:39,190
government Hermanus subcontracting ass
I'm

832
00:52:39,190 --> 00:52:42,829
thing and not and yeah

833
00:52:42,829 --> 00:52:45,880
when the government is doing is because
I'm

834
00:52:45,880 --> 00:52:48,920
the government is somewhat controlled by
the update

835
00:52:48,920 --> 00:52:52,150
I think it's much most yeah he

836
00:52:52,150 --> 00:52:55,339
oppression another unsold

837
00:52:55,339 --> 00:52:58,410
all that much sure i'm saying is me

838
00:52:58,410 --> 00:53:02,249
even even if you think we don't need the
knowledge today i think thats

839
00:53:02,249 --> 00:53:05,710
s at the table day s broader political
debate

840
00:53:05,710 --> 00:53:09,430
even if you think that today's
government is really not that bad

841
00:53:09,430 --> 00:53:13,319
it still probably wise to keep something
on July

842
00:53:13,319 --> 00:53:19,369
us over trying to do I'm well what else
can I say I can say we're opening up a

houseboat detector wire to the hood so
you just

1013
01:03:47,920 --> 01:03:51,480
time one-plus and then every time

1014
01:03:51,480 --> 01:03:55,270
it to him in thing leverage made it
possible Scott virgin

1015
01:03:55,270 --> 01:03:59,859

01:05:00,480 --> 01:05:01,920
about 70 percent to that

1033
01:05:01,920 --> 01:05:06,800
to the international maritime satellite
organization so we calculated that

1034
01:05:06,800 --> 01:05:11,670
if 10 people here connection to pass out
wide open for three days each
