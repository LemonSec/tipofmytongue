1
00:00:00,089 --> 00:00:03,919
its what was supposed to happen next is
a

2
00:00:03,919 --> 00:00:07,548
panel people who worked on 2600

3
00:00:07,549 --> 00:00:10,769
and but we lack the publisher

4
00:00:10,769 --> 00:00:15,210
this so we're thinking about doing that
for a little then

5
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:18,660
on

6
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:20,360
you

7
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:21,759
the

8
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:23,000
planes

9
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,770
home

10
00:00:24,770 --> 00:00:28,670
mom

11
00:00:28,670 --> 00:00:33,190
the banks actually expected I have about
two more hours to

12
00:00:33,190 --> 00:00:36,960
finally get around to writing when I was
gonna say but that's not just a wing in

13
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:37,610
any way

14
00:00:37,610 --> 00:00:41,220
I figured the rather than bore you wanna

15
00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:44,430
Saturday night in in New York with that

16
00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:47,699
exciting tales and how the Freedom of
Information Act works

17
00:00:47,699 --> 00:00:52,739
I their I'd tell you little bit about
what's going on in DC

18
00:00:52,739 --> 00:00:55,809
it's not pretty and

19
00:00:55,809 --> 00:00:59,809
there's a line a lot of that this
information

20
00:00:59,809 --> 00:01:03,350
put out by similar friends immediately
don't know any better

21
00:01:03,350 --> 00:01:06,620
the bobs as you're well aware there's

22
00:01:06,620 --> 00:01:10,500
several different things floating around
right now one is the

23
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:13,820
the most recent thing to emerge is now
the

24
00:01:13,820 --> 00:01:18,420
FBI's digital telephony proposal has
finally been introduced in Congress

25
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:23,060
in both the house in the senate's the
bill still requires that all

26
00:01:23,060 --> 00:01:26,210
telecommunications providers that's the
phone companies

27
00:01:26,210 --> 00:01:29,450
more specifically in this case and
manufactures

28
00:01:29,450 --> 00:01:32,960
in the people that support them have to
have built-in wiretap surveillance

29
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:35,060
capabilities with in

30
00:01:35,060 --> 00:01:38,759
03 years and to sweeten the pot they get

31
00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:43,130
half a billion dollars to do it the
other thing that's

32
00:01:43,130 --> 00:01:46,199
still going on as clipper it's not dead

33
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:49,890
I'm even with the mad blazes

34
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:54,560
assistance the thing is not dead
irregardless of what the

35
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:58,270
New York Times seems to think these

36
00:01:58,270 --> 00:02:02,009
yes I'll start first with what's going
on with digital telephony

37
00:02:02,009 --> 00:02:07,740
the bill is now been introduced I'll buy
our former friends in the

38
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:11,370
house and the Senate Senator leahy and
congressman edwards

39
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:15,730
they've decided for political reasons
that they have to introduce this thing

40
00:02:15,730 --> 00:02:19,329
and they're trying to jam it through
real quick expect to have to pass by

41
00:02:19,330 --> 00:02:23,819
next month the only problem is that
there's health care legislation going on

42
00:02:23,819 --> 00:02:26,960
the crime bill's back in DC in hasn't
been passed yet

43
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:31,100
there's appropriations bills that means
there is still a chance to kill is

44
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:32,310
sucking

45
00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:35,530
we can if you have any kinda

46
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:39,500
bill that they wanna with you quickly
there's any kind of controversy related

47
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:40,000
to it

48
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:45,030
they tend to want to slow things down
they've only had a month to do it

49
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:48,239
and if you start calling up and
screaming at your senators and

50
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:49,200
congressmen now

51
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:52,540
you can kill the thing its 2002

52
00:02:52,540 --> 00:02:56,209
2243 121 is their phone number I

53
00:02:56,209 --> 00:03:00,280
everybody in this place where to call
their senator or congressman it might

54
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:00,739
make

55
00:03:00,739 --> 00:03:05,170
a fairly good difference moms

56
00:03:05,170 --> 00:03:08,830
I don't want to get into any sort of
inner seam warfare about what the

57
00:03:08,830 --> 00:03:12,680
various public interest groups think
about this bill I'll just give you the

58
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:14,090
pics position which is

59
00:03:14,090 --> 00:03:17,180
we think it's a shitty bill we don't
like it

60
00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:21,269
there's no way we're going except any
kind a bill that requires anybody to

61
00:03:21,269 --> 00:03:21,750
have

62
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:25,150
built in surveillance capabilities is a
legal requirement

63
00:03:25,150 --> 00:03:28,790
that's just not the way this country
should be working in it such a really

64
00:03:28,790 --> 00:03:31,090
lousy precedence for everything else

65
00:03:31,090 --> 00:03:34,129
it doesn't cover electronic networks at
the moment

66
00:03:34,129 --> 00:03:37,679
which you can bet your bottom dollar
that five years from now the FBI's gonna

67
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:38,599
come back and say

68
00:03:38,599 --> 00:03:42,170
other we have this little minor
technical correction we have to do

69
00:03:42,170 --> 00:03:45,720
now we want to cover all your email
everything else

70
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:50,480
which they specifically left out this
time to limit the criticisms

71
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:55,150
I'm so call scream I can remember the
bill members of the top of my head but

72
00:03:55,150 --> 00:03:55,780
the

73
00:03:55,780 --> 00:04:00,900
in touch with you later all writing on
the board that's the

74
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:04,950
I think it's 20s 2537

75
00:04:04,950 --> 00:04:09,569
in the senate I think I don't even
exactly snow the other thing that's

76
00:04:09,569 --> 00:04:10,409
going on is

77
00:04:10,409 --> 00:04:14,859
clipper and as everybody probably song
last

78
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:19,530
couple weeks there is this flurry of
activity related to that there was

79
00:04:19,530 --> 00:04:23,480
claims made that clipper is dead that
the government is backing off

80
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:26,740
morality they're just chugging right
along

81
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:29,920
they're still buying those scrappy
little test your cards that they thought

82
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:31,640
they were jammed down our throats

83
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:36,030
they're still pushing it the only thing
it's worse now is that industry seems

84
00:04:36,030 --> 00:04:36,350
like

85
00:04:36,350 --> 00:04:39,470
their someone willing to go along a

86
00:04:39,470 --> 00:04:42,590
in how the software key escrow system
you know

87
00:04:42,590 --> 00:04:46,480
what's the difference I mean you can are
you about whether a secret algorithm

88
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:48,590
Republic algorithm is better

89
00:04:48,590 --> 00:04:53,420
but the fact is is they get to keep the
keys matt is a bad thing

90
00:04:53,420 --> 00:04:56,660
so this is not dead do not feel
comfortable at this is dead

91
00:04:56,660 --> 00:05:00,590
keep on talking about it the

92
00:05:00,590 --> 00:05:04,450
think it's probably better if I just the
open up the mic in

93
00:05:04,450 --> 00:05:08,180
let people ask questions

94
00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:09,740
yes

95
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:11,720
this

96
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:12,560
I

97
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:13,969
room

98
00:05:13,969 --> 00:05:16,449
that

99
00:05:16,449 --> 00:05:23,449
slip

100
00:05:24,729 --> 00:05:28,409
defect in the clipper chip you mean well

101
00:05:28,409 --> 00:05:33,449
man blaze discovered a way of spoofing
the clipper chips are the Tessera card

102
00:05:33,449 --> 00:05:35,389
specifically so that it look like

103
00:05:35,389 --> 00:05:39,819
you could send a fake message and they
could or you can send a message

104
00:05:39,819 --> 00:05:43,349
and then you can change the headers in
such a way that they couldn't understand

105
00:05:43,349 --> 00:05:46,849
i couldn't. Krypton I'm

106
00:05:46,849 --> 00:05:50,620
threatens and I know he's around here if
you wanna

107
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:57,540
technical description get it from him

um the way act but is designed

119
00:06:35,749 --> 00:06:39,029
it covers pretty much

120
00:06:39,029 --> 00:06:44,050
anything that would be telephony except
for specifically exempts

121
00:06:44,050 --> 00:06:47,610
out things like ham radio things and
also

122

yeah the

129
00:07:23,999 --> 00:07:30,830
why they need the digital telephony
proposing the morn

130
00:07:30,830 --> 00:07:34,700
pretty much I mean what are the key
question is always been

131
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:38,520
I'll why do you need this and they've
number come out with these an answer on

132
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:39,070
this

133
00:07:39,070 --> 00:07:43,950
a back we sued them last week to find
out exactly why the hell they want this

134
00:07:43,950 --> 00:07:44,690
thing

135
00:07:44,690 --> 00:07:48,510
they're not saying they keep giving us
the same fucking stories about

136
00:07:48,510 --> 00:07:49,599
pedophiles

137
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:51,500
a

138
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:54,640
glossy one story about pedophiles

139
00:07:54,640 --> 00:08:00,360
yeah all and then they also keep talking
about the

140
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:04,590
Elric and Jason actually when I went
around till looking up the Elric and

141
00:08:04,590 --> 00:08:05,100
case

142
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:08,980
they have a down as they stop the
dangerous Libyan terrorist attempt to

143
00:08:08,980 --> 00:08:10,880
shoot down an airliner and

144
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:14,890
in Chicago in reality it was a scam by
the FBI

145
00:08:14,890 --> 00:08:19,940
based on a scam by the lol can gang they
were taking credit for other people's

146
00:08:19,940 --> 00:08:25,300
criminal acts in Chicago and then sent
it a whole bunch of them to the Libyan

147
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:28,340
saying hey look at all the dangers
things are going I'll send us a million

148
00:08:28,340 --> 00:08:29,800
bucks place

149
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:36,320
this somehow that got translated into
the greatest law enforcement the

150
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:41,820
sable all time yes

151
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:45,600
that someone down in the in Richmond

152
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:49,330
that they claim that the use the wiretap
to to stop some

153
00:08:49,330 --> 00:08:53,300
bullshit but they have not given a
single detail in nobody actually seems

154

00:09:15,490 --> 00:09:16,980
on

163
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:19,930
a goalless low

164
00:09:19,930 --> 00:09:23,770
children is doom long the on

165
00:09:23,770 --> 00:09:27,730
levy them

166
00:09:27,730 --> 00:09:31,860
lots that's a different case but the I
mean the fact is that

167
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:35,570
neither cliburn or digital telephony
would help in that case because it's

168
00:09:35,570 --> 00:09:39,200
on the guys hard drive years and sending
email with list that is

169
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:42,620
praise or whatever you call them the

170
00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:47,330
me realize I don't know yes

171
00:09:47,330 --> 00:09:51,460
and managers think back to that one is
served I don't know a lot about the case

172
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:51,940
but

173
00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:55,360
it brings up a point that they got this
guy

174
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:59,890
using other sources of course and he's
in jail

175
00:09:59,890 --> 00:10:03,650
and they had the fact that he had to
encrypt did

176
00:10:03,650 --> 00:10:08,370
this stuff for the PGP key and they
didn't try and force them to give it

177
00:10:08,370 --> 00:10:11,760
which I think brings up a a real
interesting legal plan which is

178
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:16,069
I don't think under the fifth amendment
making force you to give the key at

179
00:10:16,070 --> 00:10:19,390
if you a trip something I I don't know

180
00:10:19,390 --> 00:10:23,050
the supreme court's a little more your
Blacky the night the for

181
00:10:23,050 --> 00:10:27,480
but I think here I think the founding
fathers would like us to think that

182
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:34,480
you can tell them to go blow themselves
if they want him here the on

183
00:10:39,350 --> 00:10:43,600
the

184
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:44,620
the

185
00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:45,279
the

186
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:48,370
yeah

187
00:10:48,370 --> 00:10:50,160
the

188
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:57,098
means

189
00:10:57,099 --> 00:11:02,410
yeah

190
00:11:02,410 --> 00:11:04,110
the

191
00:11:04,110 --> 00:11:05,790
the

192
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:08,779
on in terms of why they won it

193
00:11:08,779 --> 00:11:12,269
on I wish we know the

194
00:11:12,269 --> 00:11:16,579
my guess is it's basically one of those
immutable laws a bureaucracy

195
00:11:16,579 --> 00:11:20,860
where guys somewhere down the line
decided they wanted something

196
00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:24,110
doesn't matter how stupid it is it
doesn't matter that even the defense

197
00:11:24,110 --> 00:11:25,620
department says you can

198
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:28,660
pulled as of a site in Germany burying

199
00:11:28,660 --> 00:11:33,660
within 30 seconds they seem to think
this is the best idea since sliced bread

200
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:36,719
I even if it won't have a great deal

201
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:40,970
practical effects on a lot of people
it's important to note though is what

202
00:11:40,970 --> 00:11:42,190
they're trying to do

203
00:11:42,190 --> 00:11:45,949
is eliminate the routine use if
encryption

204
00:11:45,949 --> 00:11:50,300
then I don't have to go into the reasons
why we think routine using trypsin is

205
00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:51,519
such a good idea I think

206
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:55,360
everybody here probably knows that I'm

207
00:11:55,360 --> 00:12:00,209
but they want to make it hard its it's
not the PGP users who have to go through

208
00:12:00,209 --> 00:12:00,560
all

209
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:05,269
your idea the hoops to do it its they
want the Lotus Notes users to stop

210
00:12:05,269 --> 00:12:08,529
having its sorry are not to have it they
don't want the

211
00:12:08,529 --> 00:12:13,550
the CC male CC stuff that they're quick
mail or any of those people

212
00:12:13,550 --> 00:12:17,639
they want to make it as hard as possible
so they can keep whatever kinda

213
00:12:17,639 --> 00:12:21,990
spying apparatus they seem to think they
have the active

214
00:12:21,990 --> 00:12:25,590
the

215
00:12:25,590 --> 00:12:32,590
yeah

216
00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:35,710
yes

217
00:12:35,710 --> 00:12:37,870
Maria Cantwell the

218
00:12:37,870 --> 00:12:41,020
um the

219
00:12:41,020 --> 00:12:44,000
well Lake and wells bill is gotta sorrel

220
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,130
long nasty portrays history

221
00:12:47,130 --> 00:12:51,670
she introduce the thing last year I am a
similar something had been used by the

222
00:12:51,670 --> 00:12:53,610
brink Myers greater the year before

223
00:12:53,610 --> 00:12:57,020
the and I got passed by there

224
00:12:57,020 --> 00:13:00,270
10 the house committees it was either
bank here or

225
00:13:00,270 --> 00:13:04,380
Foreign Affairs maybe both I think then
it got to the end

226
00:13:04,380 --> 00:13:06,950
a guy with bird to the House
Intelligence Committee the House

227
00:13:06,950 --> 00:13:09,950
Intelligence Committee decided they were
going to eliminate it

228
00:13:09,950 --> 00:13:13,910
and put in this very week study me
frankly we don't need another study you

229
00:13:13,910 --> 00:13:14,490
know

230
00:13:14,490 --> 00:13:18,480
there's so much aggression out there and
it doesn't take away a rocket scientist

231
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:19,550
to accept this

232
00:13:19,550 --> 00:13:23,290
step for our friends in the airport
nobody seems to accept this

233
00:13:23,290 --> 00:13:27,189
the Intelligence Committee got it
eliminated

234
00:13:27,190 --> 00:13:31,390
they went back to the Rules Committee
which is the

235
00:13:31,390 --> 00:13:34,860
people that decide how things are going
to be voted on in congress

236
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:38,110
and they decided to allow for an open
votes

237
00:13:38,110 --> 00:13:41,709
so somewhere on the house floor when
this vote was being discussed in this is

238
00:13:41,709 --> 00:13:43,510
a general export control bill

239
00:13:43,510 --> 00:13:47,329
Maria Cantwell could have gone down
there again dropped her bill on the

240
00:13:47,329 --> 00:13:48,200
House floor

241
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:51,870
and started up again and the purpose

242
00:13:51,870 --> 00:13:54,980
means mainly to have some sort of debate

243
00:13:54,980 --> 00:13:59,010
no finally indecent house debate on
encryption

244
00:13:59,010 --> 00:14:02,560
and I know congressman brooks had a
prepared statement all sorts of other

245
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:04,620
people had prepared statements they were
gonna

246
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:08,610
in runs but for some reason and i cant
read

247
00:14:08,610 --> 00:14:12,180
Maria Cantwell mind she blames

248
00:14:12,180 --> 00:14:16,709
somewhere at the last minute she decided
she was not going to introduce that bill

249
00:14:16,709 --> 00:14:17,770
back into

250
00:14:17,770 --> 00:14:21,430
like this again I'm an owl or send her a
letter

251
00:14:21,430 --> 00:14:24,430
in the letter which probably all you
seen

252
00:14:24,430 --> 00:14:28,800
says basically we're going to do the
same old shit we're doing now

253
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:32,640
and time

254
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:35,819
Maria for some reason decided that she
was gonna

255
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:40,529
take credit now for victory and she sent
out this press release saying hey

256
00:14:40,529 --> 00:14:44,060
they've now decided to back down on
clipper the business software Alliance

257
00:14:44,060 --> 00:14:47,160
sent out a press release that said the
same thing

258
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:51,209
PFF sent out a press release that said
the same thing

259
00:14:51,209 --> 00:14:55,290
unfortunately the somebody forgot to
tell al gore about this and he

260
00:14:55,290 --> 00:14:59,430
apparently called up camp will
personally into her ass out for putting

261
00:14:59,430 --> 00:15:01,560
words in his mouth a clipper was dead

262
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:06,240
palms in addition Senator Leahy said
wait a second

263
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:10,720
I'm the expert in this field as anybody
in congress can possibly be

264
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:16,890
and I don't see any improvements in the
CS the so bad and from what I hear the

265
00:15:16,890 --> 00:15:19,150
people over injustice and people over in
the

266
00:15:19,150 --> 00:15:22,550
more were laughing our asses off the
going

267
00:15:22,550 --> 00:15:26,250
well now we have half the population
thinking the clipper is dead

268
00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:30,500
hallelujah there will be any more you
know 47,000 people signing petitions

269
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:31,540
because

270
00:15:31,540 --> 00:15:34,890
half the people have been blocking your
mind it's dead

271
00:15:34,890 --> 00:15:38,170
and it's not I'm

272
00:15:38,170 --> 00:15:39,390
the

273
00:15:39,390 --> 00:15:41,100
and

274
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:44,990
busy

275
00:15:44,990 --> 00:15:47,600
down

276
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:53,019
the a let me ask is there anybody here
for Microsoft's

277
00:15:53,019 --> 00:15:59,019
from Seattle all you um the if I were
more of a conspiracy theorist I would

278
00:15:59,019 --> 00:16:00,699
see a link between the tail

279
00:16:00,699 --> 00:16:06,190
Penn given that they have been in the
same week polymer

280
00:16:06,190 --> 00:16:10,829
I'm not I'm or maybe I just don't feel
like getting Britain by Microsoft

281
00:16:10,829 --> 00:16:13,880
we are together threatened by Intel for
putting out this very

282
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:20,880
for sending out the Big Brother Inside
sticker itself the militia

283
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:28,400
and it turns out they own twenty percent
stake in VLSI so they

284
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:32,060
were responsible for those big brother
inside the yes

285
00:16:32,060 --> 00:16:35,640
they just sold at last we hear something

286
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:39,260
pi don't know but I think a

287
00:16:39,260 --> 00:16:43,490
another interesting basset is that the
business software Alliance which is

288
00:16:43,490 --> 00:16:44,410
basically

289
00:16:44,410 --> 00:16:49,040
Microsoft is the biggest member came out
and said hey clipper is dead

290
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:53,730
and now we hear these rumors coming out
of Seattle be at the site for bonds less

291
00:16:53,730 --> 00:16:58,120
that maybe Microsoft is thinking about
implementing software key escrow into

292
00:16:58,120 --> 00:16:58,690
their

293
00:16:58,690 --> 00:17:03,040
their operating systems are in the
thanks I don't know if it's true but

294
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:09,570
the it's certainly leads the interesting
high idle speculation on

295
00:17:09,569 --> 00:17:14,329
the the little love government limits

296
00:17:14,329 --> 00:17:15,779
my name on that

297
00:17:15,779 --> 00:17:19,409
let their his mom was that the ER
they'll

298
00:17:19,409 --> 00:17:24,620
the the at all the alone

299
00:17:24,620 --> 00:17:25,980
some policies there

300
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:29,100
ability love I'm now legal

301
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:31,070
the end

302
00:17:31,070 --> 00:17:33,210
I'm

303
00:17:33,210 --> 00:17:36,480
right now one of the things they
constantly harmonious

304
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:42,180
well we can tap ISDN well according to
their own documents as far back as

305
00:17:42,180 --> 00:17:47,010
1990 they are already testing devices to
tab ISDN cell

306
00:17:47,010 --> 00:17:50,400
like most the other stuff that's coming
out to mister freeze now

307
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:56,970
you gotta take it with at least a pound
of salt the

308
00:17:56,970 --> 00:18:00,050
yeah

309
00:18:00,050 --> 00:18:07,050
the

310
00:18:09,299 --> 00:18:10,200
the

311
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:11,299
the

312
00:18:11,299 --> 00:18:14,668
with the exception of bill Zimmerman I'm
not aware of any

313
00:18:14,669 --> 00:18:17,779
investigations are many software export

314
00:18:17,779 --> 00:18:23,619
I'll however did the get a document read
before I left on

315
00:18:23,619 --> 00:18:27,488
on Thursday that was sent from the
Department

316
00:18:27,489 --> 00:18:33,609
are from the NSA saying that they while
they were teeny approved the exported as

317
00:18:33,609 --> 00:18:36,189
for financial institutions they were
never

318
00:18:36,190 --> 00:18:39,710
going to approve the export a triple
there's even for financial institutions

319
00:18:39,710 --> 00:18:41,190
was arguably

320
00:18:41,190 --> 00:18:44,570
need it quite a bit in RT have a proven
track record of

321
00:18:44,570 --> 00:18:49,529
abusing yes the so I don't see them
softening at all on this

322
00:18:49,529 --> 00:18:56,529
then

323
00:18:56,669 --> 00:19:00,090
the Electronic Privacy Information
Center is a I'm

324
00:19:00,090 --> 00:19:05,249
nonprofit public interest group all were
sponsored in part by CVs are which is

325
00:19:05,249 --> 00:19:08,049
that you care professionals for social
responsibility

326
00:19:08,049 --> 00:19:12,918
and our main sponsor is the fund the
constitutional government which is a a

327
00:19:12,919 --> 00:19:14,509
civil liberties foundation

328
00:19:14,509 --> 00:19:17,999
the I'm mostly do

329
00:19:17,999 --> 00:19:21,190
research and Lovelady

330
00:19:21,190 --> 00:19:24,919
saw me advocacy initiative called
lobbying but

331
00:19:24,919 --> 00:19:28,899
the world there's it's pretty small
there's only three of us so we don't do

332
00:19:28,899 --> 00:19:33,289
a great deal lobbying the more bomb
passing in lobbying

333
00:19:33,289 --> 00:19:36,020
the

334
00:19:36,020 --> 00:19:40,700
yet

335
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:44,809
I live in the in the suburbs on

336
00:19:44,809 --> 00:19:48,370
Maryland the

337
00:19:48,370 --> 00:19:51,229
this

338
00:19:51,229 --> 00:19:56,470
red

339
00:19:56,470 --> 00:20:00,050
claims

340
00:20:00,050 --> 00:20:03,399
the

341
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:04,799
on

342
00:20:04,799 --> 00:20:08,870
unfortunately plunder the 1974 Privacy
Act

343
00:20:08,870 --> 00:20:12,480
it specifically prohibited government
agencies both state

344
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:15,490
federal and local from asking for your
SSN

345
00:20:15,490 --> 00:20:19,159
unless they had legal authorization to
do it unfortunately Congress turned

346
00:20:19,159 --> 00:20:21,570
around a year and a half later and
gutted that

347
00:20:21,570 --> 00:20:24,770
by allowing it specifically for DMV's to
use it

348
00:20:24,770 --> 00:20:29,460
they don't have to use it but they're
allowed to use it the so there's

349
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:32,530
there's not a any great way of buying it

350
00:20:32,530 --> 00:20:39,530
because they have congressional
authorization noon

351
00:20:40,630 --> 00:20:41,520
yeah

352
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:45,049
loan

353
00:20:45,049 --> 00:20:47,100
polls

354
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:49,100
right

355
00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:52,460
the

356
00:20:52,460 --> 00:20:57,050
well there is the a group based on your
gun ownership near here anymore

357
00:20:57,050 --> 00:21:00,750
yeah still is doing up

358
00:21:00,750 --> 00:21:04,290
he did a very good job love following
with cantwell was up till

359
00:21:04,290 --> 00:21:08,220
the just recently on the

360
00:21:08,220 --> 00:21:12,710
the house government information go for
now place the whole tax the mall

361
00:21:12,710 --> 00:21:17,520
House bills online and you legal either
powers can follow how they're so to

362
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:18,430
meeting your way

363
00:21:18,430 --> 00:21:22,090
room it's still is it really easy to
track

364
00:21:22,090 --> 00:21:25,350
what's going on in DC even in DC is

365
00:21:25,350 --> 00:21:28,810
it's because they're so much of it is
going on behind the scenes there's no

366
00:21:28,810 --> 00:21:32,300
smoke-filled rooms are still the the way
of the city

367
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:36,260
that you can please follow the public
stuff that they've

368
00:21:36,260 --> 00:21:40,290
the

369
00:21:40,290 --> 00:21:47,290
yeah

370
00:21:50,330 --> 00:21:53,320
yeah

371
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:59,450
yeah

372
00:21:59,450 --> 00:22:04,470
yeah

373
00:22:04,470 --> 00:22:09,609
then

374
00:22:09,609 --> 00:22:14,908
on I know what it is I I don't agree
with that at all

375
00:22:14,909 --> 00:22:19,489
but they seem to be under the belief
that something is going to go through

376
00:22:19,489 --> 00:22:24,580
and this is the best they can deal I
personally think that's bullshit

377
00:22:24,580 --> 00:22:28,379
and I think we can kill the soccer the

378
00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:30,509
the

379
00:22:30,509 --> 00:22:35,790
the

380
00:22:35,790 --> 00:22:38,830
know I love fundamental of the objection
to the

381
00:22:38,830 --> 00:22:42,899
the law enforcement's believe that
everything should be built with their

382
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:47,830
easy access in mind the

383
00:22:47,830 --> 00:22:51,178
the and mice so my second part that is

384
00:22:51,179 --> 00:22:54,179
even if it were gonna happen and I
didn't have that

385
00:22:54,179 --> 00:22:59,730
on email thing I think it's a lousy deal
the

386
00:22:59,730 --> 00:23:00,930
you

387
00:23:00,930 --> 00:23:02,250
loan

388
00:23:02,250 --> 00:23:02,950
are

389
00:23:02,950 --> 00:23:03,490
this

390
00:23:03,490 --> 00:23:09,539
known

391
00:23:09,539 --> 00:23:11,230
means

392
00:23:11,230 --> 00:23:12,230
early years

393
00:23:12,230 --> 00:23:14,150
soon

394
00:23:14,150 --> 00:23:15,470
form

395
00:23:15,470 --> 00:23:17,260
the moon

396
00:23:17,260 --> 00:23:19,420
strong alright

397
00:23:19,420 --> 00:23:23,059
your wire then runs from room

398
00:23:23,059 --> 00:23:24,310
madams

399
00:23:24,310 --> 00:23:29,360
local news

400
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:34,070
well that's why we see the FBI they're
making these planes in the plains

401
00:23:34,070 --> 00:23:38,100
%uh move around faster than the Super
Bowl in zero gravity wrong

402
00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:41,280
just one day it's 180 in next day it's
82

403
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:45,870
the next day it's two hundred or
something they've never provide any hard

404
00:23:45,870 --> 00:23:46,970
evidence that there's

405
00:23:46,970 --> 00:23:51,640
anybody out there that they can do this
the ball what they are asking for is a

406
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:56,280
on will change in the principal on
giving them authority over how things

407
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:57,889
are going to be designed in the future

408
00:23:57,890 --> 00:24:04,890
that's the real problem at Digital Plus
I'm

409
00:24:06,330 --> 00:24:13,330
yeah

410
00:24:19,830 --> 00:24:23,220
no there's no laws that prevent you from
using encryption

411
00:24:23,220 --> 00:24:28,090
for anything at all I and even the
foreign laws are some

412
00:24:28,090 --> 00:24:33,320
dubious nature that I read the french
laws and I don't we

413
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:37,330
French that well but as I read it it
doesn't prohibit encryption either

414
00:24:37,330 --> 00:24:41,470
the all it does is require that you
register your algorithm

415
00:24:41,470 --> 00:24:44,800
the fact that you using with the public
telephone system

416
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:49,170
the so I don't even I'm not even aware
of any foreign countries

417
00:24:49,170 --> 00:24:53,240
that actually have prohibition no
singapore has been trotted out as a

418
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:57,540
shining example a country that has such
far-reaching policies

419
00:24:57,540 --> 00:25:00,710
I guess if you usually reps the you get

420
00:25:00,710 --> 00:25:07,710
he or something then

421
00:25:08,690 --> 00:25:15,690
you

422
00:25:18,770 --> 00:25:23,290
he

423
00:25:23,290 --> 00:25:27,210
well thats this old story that's been

424
00:25:27,210 --> 00:25:31,420
rolling around but the everybody I've
talked to and from the law I

425
00:25:31,420 --> 00:25:34,500
redden industry people checked up on
this pretty vigorously

426
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:39,100
they do not require you didn't he things
that the

427
00:25:39,100 --> 00:25:42,500
somebody France's here once the get
busted

428
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:46,290
I'll retract that statement but for the
moment I think

429
00:25:46,290 --> 00:25:51,230
Pakistan's Leone

430
00:25:51,230 --> 00:25:56,650
the

431
00:25:56,650 --> 00:26:02,310
reason

432
00:26:02,310 --> 00:26:07,139
the

433
00:26:07,140 --> 00:26:11,640
well this is really part of a larger
mosaic of things that are going on

434
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:15,580
there's a great number of bills in
Congress at the moment they give law

435
00:26:15,580 --> 00:26:16,350
enforcement

436
00:26:16,350 --> 00:26:20,290
easier access to a variety of things
there's been a major push

437
00:26:20,290 --> 00:26:26,050
you trying yet make law enforcement
exceptions into a lot of major loss

438
00:26:26,050 --> 00:26:29,210
a to give you one example the original
clinton health care bill that was

439
00:26:29,210 --> 00:26:30,070
introduced

440
00:26:30,070 --> 00:26:34,870
specifically provided that the attorney
general should have online access

441
00:26:34,870 --> 00:26:39,080
to the health data network there was no
requirement say yes to get a warrant he

442
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:39,699
can just

443
00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:43,140
you know one day decides he'll look up
somebody in just look them up

444
00:26:43,140 --> 00:26:47,820
no love no restrictions on they've also
pushed through something that's passed

445
00:26:47,820 --> 00:26:50,990
in the Senate to make it easier for them
to get credit reports

446
00:26:50,990 --> 00:26:54,930
instead of actually getting a warrant to
get a credit report they can send what

447
00:26:54,930 --> 00:26:57,700
they call a national security letter
which is basically

448
00:26:57,700 --> 00:27:01,400
something that some national security
bureaucrat rights up and says

449
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:05,650
for national security reasons we want
this predator part you have to trust us

450
00:27:05,650 --> 00:27:07,150
that we're doing this in the right

451
00:27:07,150 --> 00:27:11,040
mode but there's no oversight so we'll
just have to believe that you're right

452
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:15,070
there's a whole variety bills out there
like that

453
00:27:15,070 --> 00:27:18,639
that are also deleting your way through
because they are

454
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:22,150
really powerful play even though I've

455
00:27:22,150 --> 00:27:25,390
I'll admit it maybe I was wrong but I
voted for the guy

456
00:27:25,390 --> 00:27:32,390
the he has no god damn spying on this
stuff the yet

457
00:27:35,890 --> 00:27:41,710
yeah

458
00:27:41,710 --> 00:27:45,639
yeah me

459
00:27:45,639 --> 00:27:48,959
the UN's with the name really wired

460
00:27:48,959 --> 00:27:54,290
they're not slurs yeah that

461
00:27:54,290 --> 00:27:57,510
yeah I'm I do have I've been

462
00:27:57,510 --> 00:28:02,510
collecting as I run through things like
LexisNexis and green berries newspapers

463
00:28:02,510 --> 00:28:08,080
I collect regularly and places where
they've caught possibly illegal wiretaps

464
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:08,500
and

465
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:12,370
just the ones that pot that have been
reported in Press that is online

466
00:28:12,370 --> 00:28:14,020
available somewhere i cant

467
00:28:14,020 --> 00:28:17,120
well over a hundred cases in the last
ten years

468
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:21,680
and then close our friends at the FBI
the Drug Enforcement Administration

469
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:25,370
and a lot of state local Barney life he
got a little overzealous

470
00:28:25,370 --> 00:28:28,660
and started doing it on

471
00:28:28,660 --> 00:28:32,140
so it's going on out there and I'm sure
there's lotta cases were

472
00:28:32,140 --> 00:28:36,130
a huge number cases were it's an
anonymous source

473
00:28:36,130 --> 00:28:43,130
on

474
00:28:55,070 --> 00:28:56,790
the

475
00:28:56,790 --> 00:28:58,409
the

476
00:28:58,410 --> 00:29:02,130
well there's two different things
there's pen registers and then there's

477
00:29:02,130 --> 00:29:03,290
toll records

478
00:29:03,290 --> 00:29:06,399
pen registers they actually have to go
to a court

479
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:10,010
and asked for a list the ass for a
warning

480
00:29:10,010 --> 00:29:13,260
unfortunately the warning is based on a
very meet standards

481
00:29:13,260 --> 00:29:16,629
they have reason to believe that a crime
is occurring or may have occurred at

482
00:29:16,630 --> 00:29:18,050
some time

483
00:29:18,050 --> 00:29:22,090
in the 10 years a pen registers have
been legally however there's been

484
00:29:22,090 --> 00:29:25,480
probably well over twenty thousand of
them

485
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:28,810
not a single ones ever been turned down

486
00:29:28,810 --> 00:29:32,810
when I mentions when I was talking and
registers to a friend online is an

487
00:29:32,810 --> 00:29:33,960
ex-prosecutor

488
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:37,710
the other day and I mentioned on the
warrant requirement he just started

489
00:29:37,710 --> 00:29:38,420
laughing

490
00:29:38,420 --> 00:29:42,420
that whole records on the other hand are
completely unprotected

491
00:29:42,420 --> 00:29:46,490
who you call are long distance that that

is a mystery to warrant

495
00:30:00,140 --> 00:30:04,070
when I used to work for the state a
maryland is a investigator for the

496
00:30:04,070 --> 00:30:05,129
public defender's office

I could file these things that I really
wanted to so it was

498
00:30:08,350 --> 00:30:12,740
its 0 standard the it looks like in
ninety-two

499
00:30:12,740 --> 00:30:16,400
in it's kinda hard to tell with each
phone company regulates in a different

500
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:16,910
way

501

in-laws mind cell I'm sure they
regularly like them in fact I know that

518
00:31:21,590 --> 00:31:24,350
the FBI has some very sophisticated

519
00:31:24,350 --> 00:31:28,530
software out there now that
automatically and all the phone numbers

520
00:31:28,530 --> 00:31:33,160
dialed to databases relationally lease
it with other information they have

521
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:36,400
from various other investigations so
they can just

522
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:40,570
punch in a phone number that they see if
somebody in get full profile whatever

523
00:31:40,570 --> 00:31:42,040
they have on that person

524
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:47,220
instantaneously on

525
00:31:47,220 --> 00:31:50,690
whatever information they have a they
plunge into these

526
00:31:50,690 --> 00:31:54,400
computers when he called the Organized
Crime Information System another is

527
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:55,310
called the

528
00:31:55,310 --> 00:31:59,850
the drug information system there's
several intelligence systems other

529
00:31:59,850 --> 00:32:03,360
that they keep on

530
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:07,650
formerly al days is desk use one other
people also pushing the yield left knee

531
00:32:07,650 --> 00:32:12,870
on

532
00:32:12,870 --> 00:32:13,440
thing

533
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:20,440
yeah I'm

rains porn

535
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:28,039
this year the money

536
00:32:28,039 --> 00:32:31,399
there's needs that depends on the state

537
00:32:31,399 --> 00:32:35,109
california has some restrictions on
Department motor vehicle records

538
00:32:35,109 --> 00:32:41,190
there was a federal law propose which
was in the crime bill that just got shot

539
00:32:41,190 --> 00:32:42,350
down last week

540
00:32:42,350 --> 00:32:46,289
that would make it this if you went
through all these hoops you could

541
00:32:46,289 --> 00:32:48,109
actually have you name a movie

542
00:32:48,109 --> 00:32:51,659
from for many records at the DMV sold

543

Public Records and accessible by anybody

544
00:32:56,759 --> 00:32:57,330

545
00:32:57,330 --> 00:33:00,879
two dollars yeah over June and

546
00:33:00,879 --> 00:33:03,530
MSG the

547
00:33:03,530 --> 00:33:08,730
the technology yeah

548
00:33:08,730 --> 00:33:09,680
isn't it

549
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:12,120
this homes

550
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:12,640
the

551
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:15,950
me yes yes

552
00:33:15,950 --> 00:33:20,970
them with my you this morn

553
00:33:20,970 --> 00:33:22,919
you must community

554
00:33:22,919 --> 00:33:26,020
that

555
00:33:26,020 --> 00:33:29,230
he learns twenty years that

556
00:33:29,230 --> 00:33:32,640
that information the restrooms

557
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:33,280
runs

558
00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:35,220
really

559
00:33:35,220 --> 00:33:37,120
I

560
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:41,350
reasons

561
00:33:41,350 --> 00:33:42,390
runs

562
00:33:42,390 --> 00:33:43,870
some with me

563
00:33:43,870 --> 00:33:44,519
this

564
00:33:44,519 --> 00:33:48,140
this

565
00:33:48,140 --> 00:33:50,530
man

566
00:33:50,530 --> 00:33:54,420
I'm Baltimore open access to government
records but I think

567
00:33:54,420 --> 00:33:59,850
the line is at the point where you get
to know what the government is doing

568
00:33:59,850 --> 00:34:03,750
verses information that the government
is coerced at UHV

569
00:34:03,750 --> 00:34:07,040
individuals that they couldn't possibly
you can say

570
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:10,040
no I'm not going to you this information
on where I live

571
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:13,570
and then turn around and sell over
mention I think that's the game

572
00:34:13,570 --> 00:34:14,630
information that

573
00:34:14,630 --> 00:34:18,100
that the freemen Information Act
shouldn't

574
00:34:18,100 --> 00:34:22,310
allow should be disclosed because it
doesn't give any kind of ID I can tell

575
00:34:22,310 --> 00:34:22,739
what the

576
00:34:22,740 --> 00:34:25,890
positive harmony motor vehicles as
operating if they

577
00:34:25,889 --> 00:34:31,480
know by polling at somebody else's
record general I'm

578
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:35,110
that's just my pet peeve night know
there's at least one person with a

579
00:34:35,110 --> 00:34:36,550
financial interest in here who

580
00:34:36,550 --> 00:34:42,119
disagrees with me but the

581
00:34:42,119 --> 00:34:49,119
yes

582
00:34:52,790 --> 00:34:57,160
all I'm I have me following it very
closely

583
00:34:57,160 --> 00:35:00,240
but it certainly seems like it's been a
lot quieter

584
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:03,660
with the exception of the 2600 case

585
00:35:03,660 --> 00:35:08,720
I since operation Sun Devil was that
turned out to be such a bottle

586
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:12,609
I'm sure there's still a lot of stuff
going on that's very quiet some guy

587
00:35:12,609 --> 00:35:13,980
doesn't want to admit that

588
00:35:13,980 --> 00:35:17,829
well they came in kick down the store
and took his time here and all that

589
00:35:17,829 --> 00:35:22,030
but there isn't a kinda idiotic
high-profile things that are friends

590
00:35:22,030 --> 00:35:22,920
were doing before

591
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:29,390
the

592
00:35:29,390 --> 00:35:36,390
I

593
00:35:38,620 --> 00:35:40,910
is me

594
00:35:40,910 --> 00:35:42,420
my

595
00:35:42,420 --> 00:35:43,970
means

596
00:35:43,970 --> 00:35:47,410
Williams my your wall the

597
00:35:47,410 --> 00:35:48,589
room

598
00:35:48,590 --> 00:35:52,540
the

599
00:35:52,540 --> 00:35:53,940
the morning

600
00:35:53,940 --> 00:35:59,350
the

601
00:35:59,350 --> 00:36:01,640
you know why the

602
00:36:01,640 --> 00:36:03,700
they believe in

603
00:36:03,700 --> 00:36:04,380
the

604
00:36:04,380 --> 00:36:09,250
one the

605
00:36:09,250 --> 00:36:16,250
they pushed weaker cases in the past
well your home and

606
00:36:17,190 --> 00:36:20,900
that way

607
00:36:20,900 --> 00:36:22,599
the alone

608
00:36:22,599 --> 00:36:23,610
its

609
00:36:23,610 --> 00:36:27,030
it looks pretty yes it's so damn
questionable that

610
00:36:27,030 --> 00:36:30,650
I think most prosecutors are good ol
boys trying to take those cases because

611
00:36:30,650 --> 00:36:37,650
they hate to lose and year

612
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:45,600
yeah

613
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:46,680
like the

614
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:49,368
yeah

615
00:36:49,369 --> 00:36:52,829
it's certainly hard to prove intent when
if it's something

616
00:36:52,829 --> 00:36:56,219
random like that the this

617
00:36:56,219 --> 00:36:57,710
mind

618
00:36:57,710 --> 00:37:01,140
yeah

619
00:37:01,140 --> 00:37:05,480
mitzi kinda brilliant computer security
that we see in our government that they

620
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:12,480
the

621
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:14,790
the

622
00:37:14,790 --> 00:37:17,220
home

623
00:37:17,220 --> 00:37:20,400
I'm glad the our industry is
insufficient to their government

624
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:22,920
yeah

625
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:29,920
phone

626
00:37:40,630 --> 00:37:45,880
I'm a firm believer in government
oversights and I think that the

627
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:49,430
intelligence budget should be
declassified and I think that

628
00:37:49,430 --> 00:37:53,578
each individual agency's budget should
be declassified as I can possibly

629
00:37:53,579 --> 00:37:54,640
imagine

630
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:58,379
knowing that the NSA the officially
knowing that the NSA

631
00:37:58,380 --> 00:38:02,759
get about four billion dollars a year is
getting her national security

632
00:38:02,759 --> 00:38:06,119
the justification may have four days

633
00:38:06,119 --> 00:38:10,799
well if the public hears that its the
spending four million dollars on this

634
00:38:10,799 --> 00:38:14,759
they're gonna revolt against in demand
thoughts so basically they're just

635
00:38:14,759 --> 00:38:17,809
trying to save their own bureaucratic
acid by hiding

636
00:38:17,809 --> 00:38:21,140
the figures on how much they're spending
and how much

637
00:38:21,140 --> 00:38:24,558
they're getting you know how much more
they had from the previous year

638
00:38:24,559 --> 00:38:28,209
how much less and they don't want to
justify what they're doing

639
00:38:28,209 --> 00:38:33,368
the and the the the lap dogs in the
House and Senate intelligence committees

640
00:38:33,369 --> 00:38:34,219
are just

641
00:38:34,219 --> 00:38:38,839
that from what I understand they didn't
even know about delivering Tollway after

642
00:38:38,839 --> 00:38:39,930
it was under this

643
00:38:39,930 --> 00:38:43,259
they are just the

644
00:38:43,259 --> 00:38:47,989
over government oversight by Congress is
is completely non-existent

645
00:38:47,989 --> 00:38:51,040
the

646
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:53,660
led to the

647
00:38:53,660 --> 00:38:56,120
the

648
00:38:56,120 --> 00:38:57,270
United win

649
00:38:57,270 --> 00:39:03,130
words where years leave the millions

650
00:39:03,130 --> 00:39:07,790
the user that's that was the that the
BDS that had the

651
00:39:07,790 --> 00:39:14,350
that but that was completely pathetic

652
00:39:14,350 --> 00:39:19,940
yeah possibly want to this stupid as
prosecutions I've seen in a long time

653
00:39:19,940 --> 00:39:23,780
done by people who would know any better
as I understood

654
00:39:23,780 --> 00:39:27,310
this was the case in Connecticut where
some kid had

655
00:39:27,310 --> 00:39:32,380
BBS up and it had some files that
somebody else a type then put up on the

656
00:39:32,380 --> 00:39:33,260
BBS

657
00:39:33,260 --> 00:39:39,090
you that the men the and I guess

658
00:39:39,090 --> 00:39:42,740
well you know better than me but did you
say at the end the rooms for you

659
00:39:42,740 --> 00:39:45,830

all the

660
00:39:45,830 --> 00:39:49,440
this leaders on it he doesn't know if he
is the views and burned

661
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:53,780
yeah this vision is already setup

662
00:39:53,780 --> 00:39:58,120
drawn so I did some things like that
news along with the disease

663
00:39:58,120 --> 00:40:05,120
this is insanity moves will happen and
the

664
00:40:05,140 --> 00:40:09,308

ready in saliva lovely songs and the
eagle is it going to be the bridge was

667
00:40:17,589 --> 00:40:18,640
up against the wall

668
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:25,049
the usually with that yeah they do that
you read ratings

669
00:40:25,049 --> 00:40:29,440
but I think the I had no children means

670
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:33,519

678
00:40:58,109 --> 00:41:03,269
the understanding that the moon Press
you know applies as much to

679
00:41:03,269 --> 00:41:06,900
literally vision really the all these
things I got either

680
00:41:06,900 --> 00:41:12,069
they then is that with the lebanese this
is not seeking information in a lot and

681
00:41:12,069 --> 00:41:12,930
they were kneeling on

682
00:41:12,930 --> 00:41:17,720
and the devices things that the blood to
any armies number the CIA

683

for everyone

691
00:41:45,750 --> 00:41:50,380

00:43:38,150 --> 00:43:39,680
learns

736
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:42,669
yeah

737
00:43:42,670 --> 00:43:45,820
was originally supposed to be hanging

738
00:43:45,820 --> 00:43:47,079
this

739
00:43:47,079 --> 00:43:48,109
yeah

740
00:43:48,109 --> 00:43:50,109
and my thing

741
00:43:50,109 --> 00:43:57,109
liar all yes all yea numbers on wall

742
00:43:57,810 --> 00:44:01,819
for this legal the

743
00:44:01,819 --> 00:44:07,050
yeah

744
00:44:07,050 --> 00:44:10,319
a

745
00:44:10,319 --> 00:44:14,989
plus what are the major problems with
the with the system right now is

746
00:44:14,989 --> 00:44:18,559
there's nobody out there that
understands that I mean there's

747
00:44:18,559 --> 00:44:22,190
a few lawyers out there understand this
probably

748
00:44:22,190 --> 00:44:25,219
probably no more than a couple dozen

749
00:44:25,219 --> 00:44:30,839
then you those probably on the wrong
side so we 11 understand it anyway

750
00:44:30,839 --> 00:44:36,299
%uh no judges means most judges still
used typewriters or have their

751
00:44:36,299 --> 00:44:39,949
secretaries type in stuff a there when
recognize one in

752
00:44:39,949 --> 00:44:43,650
you have no other and then on the other
hand you have generally a bunch the

753
00:44:43,650 --> 00:44:46,190
prosecutors are a zealous bunch of
people

754
00:44:46,190 --> 00:44:50,739
they go for the win I mean I use the
work for the public defender's office I

755
00:44:50,739 --> 00:44:52,529
know how prosecutors work

756
00:44:52,529 --> 00:44:56,369
there their idea I'll up for doing
justice

757
00:44:56,369 --> 00:44:59,749
is the win not whether it's right or not
but

758
00:44:59,749 --> 00:45:06,749
the glory of the wind at the Games

759
00:45:10,320 --> 00:45:14,250
I'll yes

760
00:45:14,250 --> 00:45:16,920
you

761
00:45:16,920 --> 00:45:17,950
the

762
00:45:17,950 --> 00:45:22,140
it's certainly possible those are be
hard to prove and the

763
00:45:22,140 --> 00:45:25,779
people who'll be the lawyers to be
sitting on the board looking into legal

764
00:45:25,780 --> 00:45:27,059
malpractice

765
00:45:27,059 --> 00:45:30,799
also probably don't know how to use
computers either so i win

766
00:45:30,799 --> 00:45:34,049
they know well you know this was

767
00:45:34,049 --> 00:45:37,290
good good cases the so-and-so and

768
00:45:37,290 --> 00:45:40,569
things probably in all fairness one
other on

769
00:45:40,569 --> 00:45:44,200
since he got nailed on the probation
violations those are

770
00:45:44,200 --> 00:45:48,760
almost impossible the contest I you're
on probation and you

771
00:45:48,760 --> 00:45:50,740
school %uh years

772
00:45:50,740 --> 00:45:53,380
the

773
00:45:53,380 --> 00:45:54,680
the other me

774
00:45:54,680 --> 00:45:56,239
just learned

775
00:45:56,239 --> 00:45:57,800
along with

776
00:45:57,800 --> 00:46:01,320
yeah Gin Blossoms doesn't know

777
00:46:01,320 --> 00:46:03,730
the computer room

778
00:46:03,730 --> 00:46:05,500
the

779
00:46:05,500 --> 00:46:07,579
the world

780
00:46:07,579 --> 00:46:10,360
that they have the edge

781
00:46:10,360 --> 00:46:13,380
heels Nolan the doubles

782
00:46:13,380 --> 00:46:15,180
years old

783
00:46:15,180 --> 00:46:18,910
year the police force which

784
00:46:18,910 --> 00:46:19,819
ruling

785
00:46:19,820 --> 00:46:22,880
Laura whatever yeah

786
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:24,750
police as the

787
00:46:24,750 --> 00:46:26,980
would heal

788
00:46:26,980 --> 00:46:30,160
right i mean you have probably

789
00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:33,609
merely asking it soon here when you have

790
00:46:33,609 --> 00:46:36,470
people in the olfactory who

791
00:46:36,470 --> 00:46:40,020
unseemly has no concept PalmOS

792
00:46:40,020 --> 00:46:44,090
basic practices along on

793
00:46:44,090 --> 00:46:47,640
and she supposedly the computer explains

794
00:46:47,640 --> 00:46:51,799
most them all our a pretty zealous
because they're pretty small group of

795
00:46:51,800 --> 00:46:52,480
people

796
00:46:52,480 --> 00:46:58,570

00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:33,910
have him rush down and and basically

805
00:47:33,910 --> 00:47:37,240
get in their way cuz if you get in their
way then you can get nailed for

806
00:47:37,240 --> 00:47:38,890
obstruction of justice which is

807
00:47:38,890 --> 00:47:42,770
even worse if they're just coming down
there on some syrup general

808
00:47:42,770 --> 00:47:46,800
DS gonna think the

809
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:48,210
yeah

810
00:47:48,210 --> 00:47:52,020
they can do it for investigation and and
then

811
00:47:52,020 --> 00:47:56,759
if god forbid the investigation not pan
out like operation Sun Devil certainly

812
00:47:56,760 --> 00:47:58,060
never panned out there

813
00:47:58,060 --> 00:48:02,700
magical 23,000 discs that they collected
and I think they got one

814
00:48:02,700 --> 00:48:07,520
plea bargain now the entire thing was a
pretty pathetic turnover for them

815
00:48:07,520 --> 00:48:11,460
yeah

816
00:48:11,460 --> 00:48:12,200
the

817
00:48:12,200 --> 00:48:14,330
not only that at all

818
00:48:14,330 --> 00:48:17,529
yummy

819
00:48:17,530 --> 00:48:18,599
why I'm

820
00:48:18,599 --> 00:48:20,910
yeah

821
00:48:20,910 --> 00:48:22,899
the

822
00:48:22,900 --> 00:48:27,690
there has been some perhaps slight
improvement in law enforcement's

823
00:48:27,690 --> 00:48:31,260
acknowledgement This I've seen some
stuff recently where their

824
00:48:31,260 --> 00:48:36,450
suggesting making copies the hard rise
in providing equipment back in in things

825
00:48:36,450 --> 00:48:37,319
like that

826
00:48:37,319 --> 00:48:40,579
I haven't seen it actually used in
practice yet but if

827
00:48:40,579 --> 00:48:44,049
if they're actually doing that that
would be a good improvement

828
00:48:44,049 --> 00:48:48,730
yeah I mean if there's no reason for
them to keep a laser printer and yes I

829
00:48:48,730 --> 00:48:49,910
know you can slip

830
00:48:49,910 --> 00:48:53,129
two lines of code somewhere in a laser
printer somewhere

831
00:48:53,130 --> 00:48:56,270
now will be your Swiss bank accounts or
something

832
00:48:56,270 --> 00:49:00,329
in but the the but otherwise no forget
it

833
00:49:00,329 --> 00:49:05,930
yes gone

834
00:49:05,930 --> 00:49:10,410
in

835
00:49:10,410 --> 00:49:14,330
in terms of how long they can do it well
there's usually a

836
00:49:14,330 --> 00:49:19,259
statute of limitations which varies from
statue the statue three to seven years

837
00:49:19,260 --> 00:49:21,130
is pretty standard for that

838
00:49:21,130 --> 00:49:24,290
yea

839
00:49:24,290 --> 00:49:28,410
nation

840
00:49:28,410 --> 00:49:32,149
still have to have probable cause that
they have to prove to a judge but

841
00:49:32,150 --> 00:49:36,430
no there hasn't been a single wiretap
turned down by a judge in

842
00:49:36,430 --> 00:49:39,910
over seven years now and only 28

843
00:49:39,910 --> 00:49:44,890
in the last 25 years so %uh judges
aren't too hard to convince

844
00:49:44,890 --> 00:49:48,710
about probable cause I'm my opinion on
that

845
00:49:48,710 --> 00:49:50,400
maybe your own

846
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:51,140
no you know

847
00:49:51,140 --> 00:49:53,740
your arms and

848
00:49:53,740 --> 00:49:58,130
you never ridden a smile anything my
uses a mini

849
00:49:58,130 --> 00:50:02,010
even just to your friends your publisher
you publish something

850
00:50:02,010 --> 00:50:05,030
and yours is the main you're legally can
be

851
00:50:05,030 --> 00:50:09,640
not see here limit the email the signs

852
00:50:09,640 --> 00:50:13,799
much you miss the healing although I
they can always leave them with the

853
00:50:13,800 --> 00:50:14,660
human

854
00:50:14,660 --> 00:50:19,890
the well thats the that's something that
perhaps a

855
00:50:19,890 --> 00:50:23,470
after the fact is a good legal argument
that I don't think it's can save many

856
00:50:23,470 --> 00:50:24,570
people said

857
00:50:24,570 --> 00:50:28,850
computers from actually getting taken
away them not sure that's like the new

858
00:50:28,850 --> 00:50:31,160
york times really know there's freedom
of the press

859
00:50:31,160 --> 00:50:34,879
if you're the New York Times the

860
00:50:34,880 --> 00:50:38,220
leases anomalies easier than most
analysts

861
00:50:38,220 --> 00:50:43,150

862
00:50:43,150 --> 00:50:47,130

00:51:34,780 --> 00:51:41,780
years the whole that said not too
surprising if

878
00:51:42,510 --> 00:51:46,000
if anybody can actually prove that in
court they would be in a great deal

879
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:47,380
trouble

880
00:51:47,380 --> 00:51:52,099

certainly the drug war as it led to a
lessening in

884
00:52:04,339 --> 00:52:09,440
in the real fundamental belief that
there are fundamental blockages to what

885
00:52:09,440 --> 00:52:11,420
law enforcement can do i mean when
they're

886
00:52:11,420 --> 00:52:15,680
stopping cars on a regular basis for
whatever reason in there

887
00:52:15,680 --> 00:52:20,000
seizing property for for drug things
it's only

890
00:52:26,730 --> 00:52:28,569
computer crime or whether they

yeah

912
00:53:40,660 --> 00:53:43,810
it's been a very mixed bag of love

913
00:53:43,810 --> 00:53:48,560
media I mean some some even learned up
from their mistakes said

914
00:53:48,560 --> 00:53:52,099
Joe Abernathy when he was just starting
out resin just

915
00:53:52,099 --> 00:53:57,070
god-awful articles about porn on the net
and how it was going to destroy him

916
00:53:57,070 --> 00:54:01,900
the fabric of society as we know it I'm
after getting into flame and she finally

917
00:54:01,900 --> 00:54:03,369
learned his lessons

918

someone better as a reporter now yeah

919
00:54:08,740 --> 00:54:09,460

money yeah

921
00:54:15,010 --> 00:54:16,010
long line

922
00:54:16,010 --> 00:54:19,089
the yeah

923
00:54:19,089 --> 00:54:23,830
yes the new phone

924
00:54:23,830 --> 00:54:24,930
lease

925
00:54:24,930 --> 00:54:27,440
I

926
00:54:27,440 --> 00:54:29,860
maybe my

927
00:54:29,860 --> 00:54:30,720
yeah

928
00:54:30,720 --> 00:54:32,339
you know

929
00:54:32,339 --> 00:54:39,339
yeah

930
00:54:42,380 --> 00:54:44,400
yeah

931
00:54:44,400 --> 00:54:46,340
he is that is warning

932
00:54:46,340 --> 00:54:48,170
that you

933
00:54:48,170 --> 00:54:49,989
everybody's working

934
00:54:49,989 --> 00:54:56,459
home here little lizard really know
where and when they don't know what's

935
00:54:56,459 --> 00:54:57,869
going on that guy you know

936
00:54:57,869 --> 00:55:01,029
the more the these and

937
00:55:01,029 --> 00:55:04,839
and a lot of them are especially in the
smaller papers are

938
00:55:04,839 --> 00:55:08,729
thoroughly lazy to put a generously they
take what

939
00:55:08,729 --> 00:55:12,380
prosecutor gives to them in runs with
that

940
00:55:12,380 --> 00:55:16,630
and on cases like this where we are we
can articulate some

941
00:55:16,630 --> 00:55:20,200
issues they eventually learned their
lesson but the

942
00:55:20,200 --> 00:55:26,380
allow them continue to just the go on
year

943
00:55:26,380 --> 00:55:27,240
the

944
00:55:27,240 --> 00:55:33,290
the as friends or Jen or overall you're
probably over a thousand

945
00:55:33,290 --> 00:55:35,040
snow

946
00:55:35,040 --> 00:55:37,490
Mon

947
00:55:37,490 --> 00:55:41,160
people that I have regular contact with
through I mean I get

948
00:55:41,160 --> 00:55:46,540
hundreds a press calls a week a most a
lot of them are follow-up once I've

949
00:55:46,540 --> 00:55:50,259
get to talk fairly lot with a lot of the
people

950
00:55:50,260 --> 00:55:53,390
but if they're willing to call and talk
to me for long periods of time that

951
00:55:53,390 --> 00:55:57,618
indicates that they do have the a
willingness to learn about this so

952
00:55:57,619 --> 00:56:00,770
there a little better then

953
00:56:00,770 --> 00:56:07,269
than the ones I just sort of wine there
and thanks yeah I'm

954
00:56:07,269 --> 00:56:08,230
the

955
00:56:08,230 --> 00:56:15,230
your mind

956
00:56:18,670 --> 00:56:24,590
sometimes up the court ruled the court
case law on that is whether it's too

957
00:56:24,590 --> 00:56:26,200
intrusive for them to

958
00:56:26,200 --> 00:56:29,640
dnt of the yank the thing out

959
00:56:29,640 --> 00:56:35,549
and its there's no bright line that you
can say well if I sticking up here /url

960
00:56:35,550 --> 00:56:37,980
be alright but if I do this a long day

961
00:56:37,980 --> 00:56:44,980
yeah

962
00:56:47,500 --> 00:56:50,690
scheme the

963
00:56:50,690 --> 00:56:55,210
a Weller's probably more technical
people here that can answer that the may

964
00:56:55,210 --> 00:56:55,890
I don't know

965
00:56:55,890 --> 00:57:02,730
Mon out on

966
00:57:02,730 --> 00:57:09,730
is the

967
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:17,440
you know yeah

968
00:57:17,440 --> 00:57:19,830
G

969
00:57:19,830 --> 00:57:26,830
soon

970
00:57:27,880 --> 00:57:33,490
the

971
00:57:33,490 --> 00:57:37,029
the

972
00:57:37,029 --> 00:57:41,329
take a flame thrower do you know that
every person should have a small amount

973
00:57:41,329 --> 00:57:42,259
of thermite

974
00:57:42,259 --> 00:57:45,259
inside their hard drives the and you
keep

975
00:57:45,259 --> 00:57:48,349
you can get that are not defy you
probably typed that then yeah

976
00:57:48,349 --> 00:57:49,940
the

977
00:57:49,940 --> 00:57:56,940
a and with that you can the yeah

978
00:57:57,529 --> 00:57:58,240
long

979
00:57:58,240 --> 00:57:59,390
the

980
00:57:59,390 --> 00:58:02,150
personalize your microwave again but
they probably would have confiscated

981
00:58:02,150 --> 00:58:03,339
that anyway

982
00:58:03,339 --> 00:58:10,160
the yet but I don't miss a thing while
they are getting their illegal I'm

983
00:58:10,160 --> 00:58:13,379
up middle of their this simply have no
moral

984
00:58:13,380 --> 00:58:13,910
me

985
00:58:13,910 --> 00:58:18,430
the nation's 11 million years you know

986
00:58:18,430 --> 00:58:21,859
lead did have been nice sweet snippet
for Papa see their

987
00:58:21,859 --> 00:58:25,250
but they're that

988
00:58:25,250 --> 00:58:28,300
you know it's pretty over generalizing
but thank

989
00:58:28,300 --> 00:58:33,089
you could say maybe many people has
remained the morals the air but that was

990
00:58:33,089 --> 00:58:33,970
we wouldn't be here

991
00:58:33,970 --> 00:58:37,119
hugh this issue

992
00:58:37,119 --> 00:58:42,309
the are soo me are any you're very
adversarial at

993
00:58:42,309 --> 00:58:47,180
I was anybody Lindsay the not yes it was
they

994
00:58:47,180 --> 00:58:51,780
0 yeah sales as you about all this

995
00:58:51,780 --> 00:58:54,870
the geological the G

996
00:58:54,870 --> 00:58:59,240
you don't believe the love this that is
really a look at your local

997
00:58:59,240 --> 00:59:05,180
there is hardly any yeah I did but I was
blessed with many religions that is

998
00:59:05,180 --> 00:59:09,240
this is not this not only means of about
my hand and

999
00:59:09,240 --> 00:59:13,310
one I was another you never know the
time

1000
00:59:13,310 --> 00:59:17,759
there's an unprecedented there's
certainly a lot of tabloid TV

1001
00:59:17,760 --> 00:59:21,360
increasing out there and somebody calls
you

1002
00:59:21,360 --> 00:59:26,230
be careful Craig North can certainly
tell us about how well a a journalist

1003
00:59:26,230 --> 00:59:28,290
Geraldo its

1004
00:59:28,290 --> 00:59:31,660
um mean there's respectable ones out
there

1005
00:59:31,660 --> 00:59:35,180
and and watch watch the show before your

1006
00:59:35,180 --> 00:59:38,520
before you say anything in make up your
own mind whether you think

1007
00:59:38,520 --> 00:59:42,030
think they're going to convey it
accurately or not the side as you

1008
00:59:42,030 --> 00:59:44,200
years in the movie The

1009
00:59:44,200 --> 00:59:45,520
you

1010
00:59:45,520 --> 00:59:48,710
the a she's doing well

1011
00:59:48,710 --> 00:59:55,710
you know a little the valuables the moon

1012
00:59:59,099 --> 01:00:02,040
the

1013
01:00:02,040 --> 01:00:03,610
loan

1014
01:00:03,610 --> 01:00:10,020
young lawyer your mind

1015
01:00:10,020 --> 01:00:16,410
little-known

1016
01:00:16,410 --> 01:00:23,410
known

1017
01:00:30,720 --> 01:00:35,670
source

1018
01:00:35,670 --> 01:00:39,160
Bob not that I'm aware of I had the
advantage love

1019
01:00:39,160 --> 01:00:44,078
a using computer for about 12 years
before I went to law school

1020
01:00:44,079 --> 01:00:48,569
and known some you that long you know
what I mean I'm

1021
01:00:48,569 --> 01:00:52,950
so I didn't mean much training in terms
the

1022
01:00:52,950 --> 01:00:56,780
in terms of how they can learn certainly

1023
01:00:56,780 --> 01:01:00,059
the talking to somebody in this room
would be really helpful

1024
01:01:00,059 --> 01:01:05,869
for a lot of them on and a lot of the
principles I think work that we've

1025
01:01:05,869 --> 01:01:09,640
developed over two hundred years apply
fairly well

1026
01:01:09,640 --> 01:01:12,960
if you can understand some other
technical issues under

1027
01:01:12,960 --> 01:01:16,230
that underlie the your own

1028
01:01:16,230 --> 01:01:20,630
more like search and seizure and that
the man in the first amendment I think

1029
01:01:20,630 --> 01:01:26,530
pit fairly well into into cyberspace now
we just need to convince judges in

1030
01:01:26,530 --> 01:01:27,630
legislatures

1031
01:01:27,630 --> 01:01:31,339
that those should have that kinda
protections

1032
01:01:31,339 --> 01:01:35,450
in some cases they have said they have
on

1033
01:01:35,450 --> 01:01:37,590
rooms

1034
01:01:37,590 --> 01:01:40,290
I

1035
01:01:40,290 --> 01:01:44,840
not that I'm aware of there's been some

1036
01:01:44,840 --> 01:01:47,920
i've seen this and Rasool books but I
don't think they're actually in

1037
01:01:47,920 --> 01:01:53,119
in publication yet this

1038
01:01:53,119 --> 01:01:58,570
the

1039
01:01:58,570 --> 01:02:02,520
red that once not bad i mean there's
there's so

1040
01:02:02,520 --> 01:02:05,790
1 there's more in the first amendment
around than anywhere else

1041
01:02:05,790 --> 01:02:12,049
than very little insurgency in your own

1042
01:02:12,049 --> 01:02:13,019
yeah

1043
01:02:13,019 --> 01:02:16,220
the world

1044
01:02:16,220 --> 01:02:20,210
along

1045
01:02:20,210 --> 01:02:22,309
on

1046
01:02:22,309 --> 01:02:26,019
Rico is an extremely powerful tool and

1047
01:02:26,019 --> 01:02:29,559
just recently the supreme court the
enhanced its

1048
01:02:29,559 --> 01:02:33,400
its abilities a dealing with I guess it
was

1049
01:02:33,400 --> 01:02:36,569
clinics in abortion bombings or
something of that sort

1050
01:02:36,569 --> 01:02:40,719
and I gave it even more power I am not
aware of it

1051
01:02:40,719 --> 01:02:44,869
ever being used in a computer crime case
but I'm sure it's not far off

1052
01:02:44,869 --> 01:02:51,869
yeah I'm

1053
01:02:54,130 --> 01:02:57,790
bread

1054
01:02:57,790 --> 01:03:04,790
yeah I'm

1055
01:03:07,830 --> 01:03:13,430
more money is always nice them he he he
the

1056
01:03:13,430 --> 01:03:14,789
the

1057
01:03:14,789 --> 01:03:18,089
yes yes make sure it's its

1058
01:03:18,089 --> 01:03:22,380
good real non-party non play money

1059
01:03:22,380 --> 01:03:26,050
arms

1060
01:03:26,050 --> 01:03:29,540
the sides that I mean there's certainly
a a lot of

1061
01:03:29,540 --> 01:03:33,240
things people can do they care and I'm

1062
01:03:33,240 --> 01:03:36,500
expressing outrage when something stupid
is done

1063
01:03:36,500 --> 01:03:40,220
like calling your congressman and saying
I think the digital telephony proposal

1064
01:03:40,220 --> 01:03:42,650
is the most stupid thing I've ever heard
I'm gonna

1065
01:03:42,650 --> 01:03:46,910
give money your opponent if you the
Fisher King I will you too

1066
01:03:46,910 --> 01:03:49,850
you don't have to you know have their
actually send it to them but you can

1067
01:03:49,850 --> 01:03:50,810
threaten its

1068
01:03:50,810 --> 01:03:56,190
the keeping aware

1069
01:03:56,190 --> 01:04:00,540
pool making good media contacts with
people that the

1070
01:04:00,540 --> 01:04:03,800
that our interest in these issues in
offering your help is good

1071
01:04:03,800 --> 01:04:07,050
performing local groups to

1072
01:04:07,050 --> 01:04:13,380
to have a focus within a small community
pi don't know how well they're working

1073
01:04:13,380 --> 01:04:17,260
out but the others in a number of these
électronique frontiers groups out there

1074
01:04:17,260 --> 01:04:17,890
that are

1075
01:04:17,890 --> 01:04:22,310
that are somewhat forming in there sir
SEA here in New York and

1076
01:04:22,310 --> 01:04:25,310
and than DFL Austin

1077
01:04:25,310 --> 01:04:28,750
I'm join a local group I mean

1078
01:04:28,750 --> 01:04:32,990
usually there's little or no fees
involved and you can get together you

1079
01:04:32,990 --> 01:04:33,380
can

1080
01:04:33,380 --> 01:04:37,330
discuss things you can educate the
public you can educate the press

1081
01:04:37,330 --> 01:04:43,880
there great opportunity the

1082
01:04:43,880 --> 01:04:46,660
wats

1083
01:04:46,660 --> 01:04:47,578
the

1084
01:04:47,579 --> 01:04:51,290
you

1085
01:04:51,290 --> 01:04:52,460
the

1086
01:04:52,460 --> 01:04:55,700
there's a ride in different ways
different countries irv

1087
01:04:55,700 --> 01:04:59,770
protect the privacy I'm

1088
01:04:59,770 --> 01:05:03,250
in terms of just pure laws I'm

1089
01:05:03,250 --> 01:05:07,300
not in terms appear reality countries
like France and Germany have the

1090
01:05:07,300 --> 01:05:08,030
strongest

1091
01:05:08,030 --> 01:05:11,830
legal protections personal privacy
they've created

1092
01:05:11,830 --> 01:05:15,330
Privacy Commissioner's who actually
advocates within

1093
01:05:15,330 --> 01:05:19,509
the government who are only concerned
about the privacy

1094
01:05:19,510 --> 01:05:23,200
you know we know that law enforcement
has their gender and whenever these are

1095
01:05:23,200 --> 01:05:23,859
people that

1096
01:05:23,859 --> 01:05:28,560
the counterbalance it I in France the
Privacy Commissioner

1097
01:05:28,560 --> 01:05:32,060
beat back a number for puzzles for
national ID card

1098
01:05:32,060 --> 01:05:36,859
a for pointing at in electronic form for
putting it on a smart pardon

1099
01:05:36,859 --> 01:05:41,040
for several years so those are the kind
of thing we don't have anything like

1100
01:05:41,040 --> 01:05:42,560
that here in the US and its

1101
01:05:42,560 --> 01:05:46,009
really a a desperate need for land mines
my view

1102
01:05:46,010 --> 01:05:49,000
then

1103
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:55,220
room

1104
01:05:55,220 --> 01:05:58,770
well as I mentioned before from reading
the laws

1105
01:05:58,770 --> 01:06:01,910
I am talking to people in industry in
people over there

1106
01:06:01,910 --> 01:06:06,740
who are involved in this a they don't
ban the use of encryption

1107
01:06:06,740 --> 01:06:10,430
at most they may require the
registration what time algorithm in

1108
01:06:10,430 --> 01:06:13,650
many years and room

1109
01:06:13,650 --> 01:06:16,290
the

1110
01:06:16,290 --> 01:06:17,960
yet

1111
01:06:17,960 --> 01:06:19,340
E

1112
01:06:19,340 --> 01:06:23,420
salt element using PGP good luck having
them read

1113
01:06:23,420 --> 01:06:30,420
yeah the yeah I'm

1114
01:06:31,160 --> 01:06:34,170
the ROP is in here right now but

1115
01:06:34,170 --> 01:06:37,280
the Netherlands have proposed

1116
01:06:37,280 --> 01:06:41,110
a a band on encryption and they

1117
01:06:41,110 --> 01:06:44,680
someone backed off but they're still
pushing for it on it they're probably

1118
01:06:44,680 --> 01:06:46,550
gonna try and do it administratively

1119
01:06:46,550 --> 01:06:50,340
now rather than criminally so I'll look
what is insidious

1120
01:06:50,340 --> 01:06:55,200
but at some point they're definitely
moving in that direction young

1121
01:06:55,200 --> 01:06:59,390
warn not that I'm aware on

1122
01:06:59,390 --> 01:07:03,319
but the there was quite a fervor over
there that surprise them quite a bit

1123
01:07:03,320 --> 01:07:07,340
and they've backed down at least
temporarily still I can develop a

1124
01:07:07,340 --> 01:07:14,340
another sneak your way of doing it that
nobody will notice

1125
01:07:14,599 --> 01:07:19,099
yeah

1126
01:07:19,099 --> 01:07:22,700
the most recent thing that has happened

1127
01:07:22,700 --> 01:07:26,720
there's there's two different phases
though this one is a

1128
01:07:26,720 --> 01:07:30,119
Freedom of Information Act case that
we've been litigating

1129
01:07:30,119 --> 01:07:34,339
and the other was a potential civil case
against the

1130
01:07:34,339 --> 01:07:39,499
against the government against the mall
the civil case for a variety of reasons

1131
01:07:39,499 --> 01:07:43,970
didn't come about and I Q the really
actually get into it cuz I'm one of the

1132
01:07:43,970 --> 01:07:44,829
lawyers and

1133
01:07:44,829 --> 01:07:48,279
on that lawyer confidentially crap keeps
me from saying anything like that

1134
01:07:48,279 --> 01:07:51,430
the freemen Information Act request case

1135
01:07:51,430 --> 01:07:55,749
has been fairly successfully proved that
the secret service was involved

1136
01:07:55,749 --> 01:07:59,479
in just about three weeks ago a federal
judge ordered the secret service

1137
01:07:59,479 --> 01:08:02,140
disclose the documents to us and
rejected

1138
01:08:02,140 --> 01:08:05,578
the secret service's arguments they
shouldn't give them to us now they've

1139
01:08:05,579 --> 01:08:06,440
appeal that

1140
01:08:06,440 --> 01:08:09,499
and we're waiting to hear what the judge
is gonna say on that

1141
01:08:09,499 --> 01:08:14,619
I so it's possible we can get something
in your future but it's more likely that

1142
01:08:14,619 --> 01:08:15,499
it's gonna take

1143
01:08:15,499 --> 01:08:21,270
up quite a bit more legal wrangling
before we get anything out on

1144
01:08:21,270 --> 01:08:22,330
the

1145
01:08:22,330 --> 01:08:23,040
the

1146
01:08:23,040 --> 01:08:26,120
they supposedly returned almost
everything the day after

1147
01:08:26,120 --> 01:08:32,330
are within a couple days after the

1148
01:08:32,330 --> 01:08:36,238
them

1149
01:08:36,239 --> 01:08:37,170
the

1150
01:08:37,170 --> 01:08:42,200
it's certainly feasible though they've
been so embarrassed by the last couple

1151
01:08:42,200 --> 01:08:43,019
they've done

1152
01:08:43,020 --> 01:08:47,690
that they may think twice about doing
unless they have a really

1153
01:08:47,690 --> 01:08:54,360
solid cases against people I doubt we'll
ever see anything on the scale Sun Devil

1154
01:08:54,359 --> 01:08:55,529
again I was just

1155
01:08:55,529 --> 01:08:59,160
um really stupid on their part I

1156
01:08:59,160 --> 01:09:03,599
based mostly appears out of ignorance
and an inability to understand what was

1157
01:09:03,600 --> 01:09:08,639
going on

1158
01:09:08,639 --> 01:09:11,819
Jesus were sick congressional hearings
as senator Nash

1159
01:09:11,819 --> 01:09:15,839

1160
01:09:15,839 --> 01:09:19,948

1161

you want me to do. that I think the

1163
01:09:31,940 --> 01:09:35,400
spending deal for your buttons

1164
01:09:35,400 --> 01:09:38,380
I no still

1165
01:09:38,380 --> 01:09:42,160
this thing else

1166
01:09:42,160 --> 01:09:45,589

the homeless
