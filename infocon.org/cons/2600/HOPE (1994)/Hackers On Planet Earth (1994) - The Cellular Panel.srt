you know hopefully I'm on ambitious

352
00:24:02,670 --> 00:24:09,670
it network very well so club

353
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:13,860
so you you location %um

354
00:24:13,860 --> 00:24:16,990
a

355
00:24:16,990 --> 00:24:20,850
I I'm

356
00:24:20,850 --> 00:24:27,850
I all

357
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:33,160
it goes just you awesome

358
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:36,750
I do so those

359
00:24:36,750 --> 00:24:40,380
I'm were next year Mike or

360
00:24:40,380 --> 00:24:44,780
up

361
00:24:44,780 --> 00:24:48,340
I I

362
00:24:48,340 --> 00:24:51,540
do so this time is to be much more
secure than us

363
00:24:51,540 --> 00:24:54,860
or Montagna %um on it I

364
00:24:54,860 --> 00:24:58,200
maunderings all will always be

365
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:01,480
all only used by the mall but

366
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:06,460
variable and a

367
00:25:06,460 --> 00:25:12,510
me of yeah owns the most interesting

368
00:25:12,510 --> 00:25:16,760
and I'm using this and Russia

369
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:19,950
well

370
00:25:19,950 --> 00:25:25,140
right settlers and why I have my

371
00:25:25,140 --> 00:25:29,120
aggressiveness and wanna find anything I
write yeah

372
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:32,960
with a high note is in use in energy
time %um

373
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:36,000
you know yeah yes

374
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:43,000
yeah

375
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:47,460
that is true right yeah how long is amps
going to be around for

376
00:25:47,460 --> 00:25:51,570
prolly a while I mean there's still Sun
everybody amps phones right

377
00:25:51,570 --> 00:25:54,700
an ounce they're making money off its
working

378
00:25:54,700 --> 00:25:58,700
on maybe ten years

379
00:25:58,700 --> 00:26:05,700
10 when the back both

380
00:26:08,039 --> 00:26:11,309
who what's this spreading technique with
CDMA

381
00:26:11,309 --> 00:26:15,450
its side direct sequence on spread
spectrum

382
00:26:15,450 --> 00:26:22,450
go

383
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:28,720
are they can overlay the the spread
spectrum on top of existing

384
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:32,150
inland towns probably not on

385
00:26:32,150 --> 00:26:36,510
but I think they could other gonna do
set aside I 1.23 makers John

386
00:26:36,510 --> 00:26:42,580
you

387
00:26:42,580 --> 00:26:44,289
on you mean with the count thing

388
00:26:44,289 --> 00:26:47,860
or with the spread spectrum

389
00:26:47,860 --> 00:26:52,500
the mean there's the spread sequence
considering it's around them

390
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:56,340
yeah in your phone knows what the
sequences

391
00:26:56,340 --> 00:27:01,809
Nick the shared secret data

392
00:27:01,809 --> 00:27:06,000
okay that's right

393
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:09,210
it's a shared with its appeal it's a

394
00:27:09,210 --> 00:27:12,470
a data field that's in your phone and

395
00:27:12,470 --> 00:27:16,659
it's also in the via telephone companies
database

396
00:27:16,659 --> 00:27:21,059
kinda but the trick is not to send

397
00:27:21,059 --> 00:27:24,600
this year deep-sea they don't send the
shared secret data across the channel in

398
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:25,390
the care

399
00:27:25,390 --> 00:27:30,500
yeah

400
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:33,799
are

401
00:27:33,799 --> 00:27:40,799
yeah I'm fine

402
00:27:40,820 --> 00:27:42,950
it book

403
00:27:42,950 --> 00:27:46,280
right on

404
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:52,110
no the other side yeah I think explain
that the other side does exactly the

405
00:27:52,110 --> 00:27:53,020
same thing

406
00:27:53,020 --> 00:27:56,740
they have the random number cuz you send
it to him they have your yes and they

407
00:27:56,740 --> 00:27:57,559
have your man

408
00:27:57,559 --> 00:28:01,620
they have the shared secret data so they
take the same quantities

409
00:28:01,620 --> 00:28:05,059
and run it through the your cave
algorithm and Justin see if the of

410
00:28:05,059 --> 00:28:05,889
matches

411
00:28:05,890 --> 00:28:09,580
yeah exactly it's a lot like ripped

412
00:28:09,580 --> 00:28:14,439
on UNIX system drug yeah

413
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:18,270
%um accused

414
00:28:18,270 --> 00:28:23,668
on

415
00:28:23,669 --> 00:28:28,880
account is stored in the phone and in
the switch winner

416
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:32,950
me all

417
00:28:32,950 --> 00:28:38,880
said now

418
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:42,260
yeah that's it yankee just keep trying
with the different count on it at the

419
00:28:42,260 --> 00:28:43,430
other guy said the same thing

420
00:28:43,430 --> 00:28:47,700
on it yeah you could on see why not

421
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:50,890
if you could trigger fun and doing it
but I'm saying that the system would

422
00:28:50,890 --> 00:28:51,550
notice your

423
00:28:51,550 --> 00:28:55,600
kinda bashing away on this county would
prolly the system is smart

424
00:28:55,600 --> 00:29:00,280
cut you off completely oh yeah and CDMA
the the baby skin

425
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:06,530
can lock your phone so you kinda become
a nice from

426
00:29:06,530 --> 00:29:11,710
yep tracking

427
00:29:11,710 --> 00:29:18,710
ship

428
00:29:19,740 --> 00:29:22,830
so you want to know whether the system

429
00:29:22,830 --> 00:29:27,189
can track you as you go around salt cell
like in knows where you're at

430
00:29:27,190 --> 00:29:31,450
on yeah out its gonna know where you're
at

431
00:29:31,450 --> 00:29:34,900
arm I'm not sure to what degree

432
00:29:34,900 --> 00:29:40,280
but its not

433
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:47,280
okay go ahead and and tell us about your
son good

434
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:54,320
hood

435
00:30:02,850 --> 00:30:09,850
home

436
00:30:10,289 --> 00:30:17,289
me

437
00:30:19,830 --> 00:30:26,830
yes

438
00:30:32,549 --> 00:30:34,980
right so they can police with GSM

439
00:30:34,980 --> 00:30:38,290
armed know your position much more
accurately than the cell level

440
00:30:38,290 --> 00:30:41,490
I don't see why they couldn't do the
same thing with the

441
00:30:41,490 --> 00:30:46,110
CDMA actually I was thinking I mean you
can also use that as like a service

442
00:30:46,110 --> 00:30:49,150
you could do positioning with the
cellular system

443
00:30:49,150 --> 00:30:52,250
you know they find out where your at me
tell you

444
00:30:52,250 --> 00:30:55,710
something you know you can find yourself
on your little digital map I guess

445
00:30:55,710 --> 00:30:58,830
yep

446
00:30:58,830 --> 00:31:03,928
an

447
00:31:03,929 --> 00:31:07,870
good question you might have to find out
if they'll be informal registration if

448
00:31:07,870 --> 00:31:09,080
you can access a database

449
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:12,100
yeah I mean this is all based on these
databases

450
00:31:12,100 --> 00:31:15,419
been up and running in being able to
exchange information

451
00:31:15,419 --> 00:31:19,049
I'm in all these different cellular
companies on their own database

452
00:31:19,049 --> 00:31:26,049
so who knows

453
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:33,580
okay right with yet one of the big
problems

454
00:31:33,580 --> 00:31:37,909
month is hard to do CMA is you have the
seat a random sequence the you're

455
00:31:37,910 --> 00:31:38,760
multiplying

456
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:42,060
your bitstream comment on your vocoder
with I'm

457
00:31:42,060 --> 00:31:45,909
it's more complicated that this say that
how do you have the suit around single

458
00:31:45,910 --> 00:31:50,390
sequence on at the transmitter and the
receiver synchronized on the way they do

459
00:31:50,390 --> 00:31:50,810
it

460
00:31:50,810 --> 00:31:55,460
on 1cd a man is that there's a pilot
channel

461
00:31:55,460 --> 00:31:59,830
that transmits just the Syrian sequence
so the mobile pic set up

462
00:31:59,830 --> 00:32:04,100
and uses that Cena Ryback say just get a
time delay in transmission

463
00:32:04,100 --> 00:32:09,650
and they take that into account yeah
yeah

464
00:32:09,650 --> 00:32:14,050
yeah

465
00:32:14,050 --> 00:32:16,760
to the government have a say in the cave
art using the cave

466
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:20,030
algorithm mom mom

467
00:32:20,030 --> 00:32:24,629
yeah but why would the government wanna
get your authentication information you

468
00:32:24,630 --> 00:32:25,010
know

469
00:32:25,010 --> 00:32:28,190
from he didn't

470
00:32:28,190 --> 00:32:33,640
they were doing your oh they had a say
in designing inspect are no I

471
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:36,820
unanswered on I would same probably not

472
00:32:36,820 --> 00:32:40,889
in the US but right but

473
00:32:40,890 --> 00:32:44,860
okay okay place members members Clippers
different

474
00:32:44,860 --> 00:32:49,060
this is this is using encryption
two-year authentication

475
00:32:49,060 --> 00:32:53,429
right the boys encryption for CDMA is
not great

476
00:32:53,430 --> 00:32:56,500
okay it's not that secure

477
00:32:56,500 --> 00:32:59,510
I'm so

478
00:32:59,510 --> 00:33:05,770
YouTube months all right maybe we'll
move on some the other people on a

479
00:33:05,770 --> 00:33:06,830
sailboat known

480
00:33:06,830 --> 00:33:10,080
I am bernie gonna go next

481
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:17,080
miss Kentucky here have its

482
00:33:25,510 --> 00:33:26,010
is working

483
00:33:26,010 --> 00:33:29,180
yeah well I had hoped to

484
00:33:29,180 --> 00:33:33,230
and actually have a a demonstration of
Howard how one could end

485
00:33:33,230 --> 00:33:37,340
legally or not so legally clone a
cellular phone that is duplicate

486
00:33:37,340 --> 00:33:41,420
at the telephone number and chill memory
sale if you need one the other and

487
00:33:41,420 --> 00:33:45,130
whole bunch of my stuff was ripped off
last night I was doing the clipper chip

488
00:33:45,130 --> 00:33:48,780
demonstration so I don't have any that
and

489
00:33:48,780 --> 00:33:53,250
working demonstration show you people on
had three founding and ripped up but

490
00:33:53,250 --> 00:33:57,060
anyway I can know at least let you hear
what cellular signal sound like

491
00:33:57,060 --> 00:34:01,090
and I can touch upon how it's done I
didn't stall saw four

492
00:34:01,090 --> 00:34:05,170
which enables you to performace feed
with the Standard &

493
00:34:05,170 --> 00:34:09,780
MS DOS PC at installed on the network
and anyone interested in downloading I

494
00:34:09,780 --> 00:34:10,460
can a

495
00:34:10,460 --> 00:34:14,610
kits and directory called us else of
cels a lefty

496
00:34:14,610 --> 00:34:18,610
and I'm not is familiar with the network
is in the other people are here so if it

497
00:34:18,610 --> 00:34:21,830
talk to the folks in the network
operations center you can download the

498
00:34:21,830 --> 00:34:22,909
code is about a

499
00:34:22,909 --> 00:34:27,020
$700k files in that directory so on

500
00:34:27,020 --> 00:34:30,230
I'm not going to go into too many
technical details

501
00:34:30,230 --> 00:34:33,300
but I would imagine there's a a fair
number people here that

502
00:34:33,300 --> 00:34:36,419
but don't know a lot about a sailor

503
00:34:36,418 --> 00:34:39,629
communications and is gonna go to some
other basics about the

504
00:34:39,630 --> 00:34:43,480
the theory how it works without the
technical details just sort of the

505
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:47,380
the layman's X explanation and I can
take some questions afterward I wanna

506
00:34:47,380 --> 00:34:48,360
touch also on

507
00:34:48,360 --> 00:34:52,250
but the problems with cellular fraught
with with the amp system which

508
00:34:52,250 --> 00:34:56,550
Jason did not go over on basically how
that is done in which

509
00:34:56,550 --> 00:35:00,660
trying to be done to to prevent that are
least a cut it down

510
00:35:00,660 --> 00:35:04,710
so on I'm gonna touch on mobile
communications mobile telephone

511
00:35:04,710 --> 00:35:05,700
communications from

512
00:35:05,700 --> 00:35:09,990
I from the early days on a sale are

513
00:35:09,990 --> 00:35:13,020
car phones are mobile phones have really
been around since

514
00:35:13,020 --> 00:35:17,130
I like the nineteen fifties and the way
they work

515
00:35:17,130 --> 00:35:21,330
generally is that basically cellular
fans a tire and car fans

516
00:35:21,330 --> 00:35:25,150
they are not telephones on they are
two-way radios

517
00:35:25,150 --> 00:35:28,840
and they are what r I

518
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:33,440
well the offer to us full-duplex two-way
radios that is they allow

519
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:36,450
you to hear and speak at the same time
one likes a

520
00:35:36,450 --> 00:35:40,339
a CB radio or some other form a two-way
walkie-talkie or something

521
00:35:40,340 --> 00:35:43,800
you to take turns talking you can only
transmit on

522
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:46,810
while you're not listening you can
listen while you're not transmitting you

523
00:35:46,810 --> 00:35:47,400
take turns

524
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:51,070
on a regular phone let you know how so
business

525
00:35:51,070 --> 00:35:55,120
you can actually talk and hear the same
time so you actually dealing with it

526
00:35:55,120 --> 00:35:58,220
radio transmitter in a radio receiver
I'm

527
00:35:58,220 --> 00:36:02,150
in a mobile or cellular telephone
they're working simultaneously your

528
00:36:02,150 --> 00:36:03,980
voice is being transformed the other
person

529
00:36:03,980 --> 00:36:08,100
any other person's voice is being
transferred to you at the same time so

530
00:36:08,100 --> 00:36:11,390
both people can interrupt each other
like my people talk on

531
00:36:11,390 --> 00:36:15,670
fence on if I'm going to simply for
people

532
00:36:15,670 --> 00:36:18,710
stop me on I N

533
00:36:18,710 --> 00:36:22,240
the nineteen seventies I

534
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:26,370
I'll talk about the old mobile phones is
no way that work basically is set

535
00:36:26,370 --> 00:36:29,569
there was one in every metropolitan area
and they're only

536
00:36:29,570 --> 00:36:33,720
fountain metropolitan areas until fairly
recently because there wasn't enough

537
00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:37,400
the customer base to to make it feasible
to offer the service could get the

538
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:38,650
revenue from this describe urs

539
00:36:38,650 --> 00:36:42,330
on there was one radio transmitter tower

540
00:36:42,330 --> 00:36:46,779
and known as a repeater repeater being
that it can receive

541
00:36:46,780 --> 00:36:50,830
at a signal and retransmit a great
receiver signal from there

542
00:36:50,830 --> 00:36:54,080
from the car mobile unit and then be
transmitted from high places lined up a

543
00:36:54,080 --> 00:36:54,660
mountain

544
00:36:54,660 --> 00:36:57,970
on a tower up at a much higher power
level over a

545
00:36:57,970 --> 00:37:01,640
abroad distance so that on your signal
would be going from

546
00:37:01,640 --> 00:37:05,370
to your car populist our and then picked
up from

547
00:37:05,370 --> 00:37:09,200
easily by isn't it a high location as a
line of sight viewers love

548
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:12,300
all the area that would be transmitted a
much higher power level

549
00:37:12,300 --> 00:37:16,110
on the older a mobile telephone service

550
00:37:16,110 --> 00:37:19,550
workers want our in the area and because

551
00:37:19,550 --> 00:37:22,860
there is a very limited number radio
frequencies available and they're

552
00:37:22,860 --> 00:37:26,570
usually in the VHF range in the 150 to
160 makers range

553
00:37:26,570 --> 00:37:30,580
on you had on a very limited number
people to talk any given time

554
00:37:30,580 --> 00:37:34,460
on I and I mean very limited in like ten
or twelve people in

555
00:37:34,460 --> 00:37:38,570
you know in a given area that is like a
a town or something

556
00:37:38,570 --> 00:37:42,630
that was when only really rich people
had fans so in the seventies a

557
00:37:42,630 --> 00:37:46,700
that didn't work out too well because
more more people and fans doctors and

558
00:37:46,700 --> 00:37:47,320
lawyers were

559
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:50,830
they wanted fans so and other people
with money

560
00:37:50,830 --> 00:37:54,340
so why they developed a new system
called IMTS them improve mobile

561
00:37:54,340 --> 00:37:55,730
telephone service

562
00:37:55,730 --> 00:37:59,530
and that used at more channels

563
00:37:59,530 --> 00:38:04,690
in both the VHF and UHF range is that
propaganda RAM 250 under six megahertz

564
00:38:04,690 --> 00:38:05,310
in

565
00:38:05,310 --> 00:38:09,120
the UHF range in roughly 450 to

566
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:12,560
460 megahertz range a standard at

567
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:17,370
FN I type signals and they were not
encrypt it in a way you just pick them

568
00:38:17,370 --> 00:38:19,560
up with a regular radio receiver

569
00:38:19,560 --> 00:38:22,700
I our scanners at work and be

570
00:38:22,700 --> 00:38:26,930
in the eye and DS systems had the maybe
twenty or thirty channels

571
00:38:26,930 --> 00:38:30,040
and that was even better than the older
system

572
00:38:30,040 --> 00:38:33,190
but obviously there's still got clogged
and you had to wait sometimes years

573
00:38:33,190 --> 00:38:33,750
together

574
00:38:33,750 --> 00:38:37,260
a number on so the folks at

575
00:38:37,260 --> 00:38:41,300
it it developer tea companies actually
AT&T

576
00:38:41,300 --> 00:38:44,450
knew that this was gonna be a problem
years and years ago so they work on

577
00:38:44,450 --> 00:38:46,700
developing new technology called
cellular

578
00:38:46,700 --> 00:38:50,480
and reasons called cellular is at if you
were to look at a map above

579
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:54,230
up area this cover by so a cellular
system

580
00:38:54,230 --> 00:38:58,520
I'm that would show where all the sailor
transmitters and receivers are that

581
00:38:58,520 --> 00:38:59,430
communicate with the

582
00:38:59,430 --> 00:39:02,520
with a mobile units I each each each

583
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:05,580
cower covers a small geographical range

584
00:39:05,580 --> 00:39:09,090
and if you look at a map for that it
would look like a honeycomb arrangement

585
00:39:09,090 --> 00:39:12,040
a look would look like cells like at my
gonna be on live

586
00:39:12,040 --> 00:39:15,120
so that's that's where the red sailor
comes from on

587
00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:18,990
the big difference when cellular and the
older types if mobile phones is a

588
00:39:18,990 --> 00:39:22,170
is that there's a lot of differences but
the main thing is that there's not one

589
00:39:22,170 --> 00:39:23,760
central transmitter and receiver

590
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:26,810
that that goes through all this thing
there's there's %uh

591
00:39:26,810 --> 00:39:30,890
a and there's a much more frequencies
recycling on

592
00:39:30,890 --> 00:39:35,190
when sail away with that the first just
a mining operation Chicago

593
00:39:35,190 --> 00:39:39,220
in the early eighties and

594
00:39:39,220 --> 00:39:42,700
the cellular started with 666 channels

595
00:39:42,700 --> 00:39:45,730
in the frequency range from 870

596
00:39:45,730 --> 00:39:50,160
890 megahertz no those are the thats
therefore channel that is this

597
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:53,740
this transmissions from the tower to the
cars

598
00:39:53,740 --> 00:39:57,060
at that time they were hand held ones
they're just car sale event

599
00:39:57,060 --> 00:40:00,860
they were from that its 70-day I

600
00:40:00,860 --> 00:40:04,360
a ninety megahertz and then the reverse
channel that is from the

601
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:07,690
the mobile units to the to the cell
sites dare

602
00:40:07,690 --> 00:40:11,030
forty five megahertz lower than that I'm

603
00:40:11,030 --> 00:40:18,030
roughly the write write that down

604
00:40:19,050 --> 00:40:22,710
deeply 835 I'm

605
00:40:22,710 --> 00:40:26,690
that within 35 both roughly

606
00:40:26,690 --> 00:40:30,650
can't you Matt am too tired roughly her
3535 megahertz

607
00:40:30,650 --> 00:40:34,070
and the channels are spaced and 30
killer hurts steps

608
00:40:34,070 --> 00:40:38,850
so while I'm that provides for a lotta
my good voice really it's pretty clear

609
00:40:38,850 --> 00:40:42,690
and no give a demonstration happy that
isn't sure well on

610
00:40:42,690 --> 00:40:46,630
in any given cellular area Seiya in a
city like Manhattan

611
00:40:46,630 --> 00:40:50,950
you talking about a dozens and dozens if
not scores of

612
00:40:50,950 --> 00:40:53,950
cell sites and each

613
00:40:53,950 --> 00:40:58,860
I love those set 666 now actually there
an ETA channels a few years ago and it

614
00:40:58,860 --> 00:41:00,000
got more

615
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:03,030
on to that 832 I

616
00:41:03,030 --> 00:41:06,350
channels there's a lot of controversy
about to the cereal companies asking for

617
00:41:06,350 --> 00:41:08,089
those extra frequencies because wanna

618
00:41:08,090 --> 00:41:11,750
when that sale companies went to the FCC
back in the early 80s saying

619
00:41:11,750 --> 00:41:15,090
we need this much radio spectrum I

620
00:41:15,090 --> 00:41:18,110
for our cellular services the FCC a said

621
00:41:18,110 --> 00:41:21,060
well you know what gives you the right
to use about the trade is back and he

622
00:41:21,060 --> 00:41:21,520
said well

623
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:24,720
will try to make a very efficient
because so you never designing so that

624
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:28,870
all the frequencies will be in use on
and will be a lot more fishing will be

625
00:41:28,870 --> 00:41:29,520
able to put

626
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:32,840
100 you're not that if not thousands
people on on the found

627
00:41:32,840 --> 00:41:36,000
any given moment so the ACC one had said
okay we'll

628
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:40,580
will do this for you but two years later
they realize that that wasn't enough

629
00:41:40,580 --> 00:41:43,680
and went back to the FEC and set out
well you made a mistake we can any more

630
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:44,609
frequencies

631
00:41:44,610 --> 00:41:47,440
more frequencies available means the
more they can sell in the money they can

632
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:48,320
make an

633
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:51,840
sailor companies are in the making ally
money but any given so

634
00:41:51,840 --> 00:41:55,410
metropolitan area to have him scores a

635
00:41:55,410 --> 00:42:00,310
cell sites and they're very low-power
suppose the old mobile phones which

636
00:42:00,310 --> 00:42:01,100
would be a

637
00:42:01,100 --> 00:42:04,640
forty or fifty what's a transmission
power the the newer

638
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:08,290
smaller pocket sailor fans like a

639
00:42:08,290 --> 00:42:13,270
this one's made in: okie and

640
00:42:13,270 --> 00:42:16,310
this one hears made by Motorola they
only transmit

641
00:42:16,310 --> 00:42:19,620
600 Miller Lites Navarre FL put it there

642
00:42:19,620 --> 00:42:23,569
at their highest to power level that
six-tenths about what

643
00:42:23,570 --> 00:42:27,240
now when I say for power level and the
the power output and he's found his

644
00:42:27,240 --> 00:42:28,590
continuously

645
00:42:28,590 --> 00:42:31,890
changing because the cellular system

646
00:42:31,890 --> 00:42:35,000
I basically the computers

647
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:39,120
sensed how close you are to a cell site
if you're very close to a cell site

648
00:42:39,120 --> 00:42:43,130
you can pick you up on very easily
without having to

649
00:42:43,130 --> 00:42:46,810
you transmit the full 600 Milazzo the

650
00:42:46,810 --> 00:42:50,930
this system will adjust your power
output on the cellular found down to

651
00:42:50,930 --> 00:42:55,290
as low as I believe 10 know what
switches extremely weak signal but

652
00:42:55,290 --> 00:42:58,920
army can be still picked up if you're
nearby cell sites or to death a tacit I

653
00:42:58,920 --> 00:43:00,860
believe in 40 be steps

654
00:43:00,860 --> 00:43:04,740
come from a few Miller lights up to 600
miller wants

655
00:43:04,740 --> 00:43:08,810
I'm that makes it very difficult to

656
00:43:08,810 --> 00:43:13,770
intercept the the reverse channel that
is the signal from the fam into the

657
00:43:13,770 --> 00:43:17,009
to the cell say you have to pretty near
the fountain on but it

658
00:43:17,010 --> 00:43:20,940
for the four channels from the year from
the base station to cell sites to the

659
00:43:20,940 --> 00:43:24,200
to defend themselves to be picked up
miles away with the standard radio

660
00:43:24,200 --> 00:43:25,750
receiving equipment

661
00:43:25,750 --> 00:43:28,850
I'm mitzi

662
00:43:28,850 --> 00:43:33,360
the there was a big problem with the

663
00:43:33,360 --> 00:43:37,700
sailor friday started happening probably

664
00:43:37,700 --> 00:43:41,200
back around nineteen eighty 5 I'd say

665
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:47,140
and it has to do with how sailor found
work that made it possible

666
00:43:47,140 --> 00:43:51,470
on when you turn on a cellular telephone
the first thing it does

667
00:43:51,470 --> 00:43:55,830
when you turn it on is it sends its

668
00:43:55,830 --> 00:44:00,200
when you turn on the make a little a
know if people ha

669
00:44:00,200 --> 00:44:03,170
be people telling her that you have
ceiling fans seems to make sense and

670
00:44:03,170 --> 00:44:03,970
what it does is it

671
00:44:03,970 --> 00:44:07,060
it looks for than your cell site on

672
00:44:07,060 --> 00:44:10,759
usually on it will find with there's
something called the initial

673
00:44:10,760 --> 00:44:13,970
paging channel if you have the

674
00:44:13,970 --> 00:44:17,530
your system on the bed the local phone
companies

675
00:44:17,530 --> 00:44:21,270
a system such as that NYNEX mobile

676
00:44:21,270 --> 00:44:26,360
where they hear nynex a cellular one and
nynex

677
00:44:26,360 --> 00:44:30,450
every the way the FTC set this up is a
the first 666

678
00:44:30,450 --> 00:44:35,340
first 333 at 6-under 66 channels were
signed to the phone local phone company

679
00:44:35,340 --> 00:44:39,610
and the second 333 a the sixty 60
channels were signed to a competing

680
00:44:39,610 --> 00:44:42,010
company and restated that was they felt
the

681
00:44:42,010 --> 00:44:46,870
each each market should have to cellular
carriers to provide competition

682
00:44:46,870 --> 00:44:50,290
but as it turns out on the

683
00:44:50,290 --> 00:44:53,520
the competing companies in each area
pretty much went always in cahoots with

684
00:44:53,520 --> 00:44:56,340
each other and decided to fix the rate
so the both had to pay about the same

685
00:44:56,340 --> 00:44:57,020
much

686
00:44:57,020 --> 00:45:00,370
if you if you go any any area the sailor
service you'll find that the

687
00:45:00,370 --> 00:45:04,259
the pricing structure for both the
wireline carrier which is the mobile

688
00:45:04,260 --> 00:45:07,870
that local bell operating company and
the non wireline company which would be

689
00:45:07,870 --> 00:45:09,130
like saying other one

690
00:45:09,130 --> 00:45:12,910
the fine at the pricing is almost
identical so they realize if they can

691
00:45:12,910 --> 00:45:14,640
the price wars with each other they

692
00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:17,350
it would be actually reasonably priced
it would have to pay so much they

693
00:45:17,350 --> 00:45:18,490
decided they're gonna

694
00:45:18,490 --> 00:45:22,520
said the price is high in both ends in
we pay for that

695
00:45:22,520 --> 00:45:26,030
on so the the SEC's the attempted

696
00:45:26,030 --> 00:45:29,740
providing a I'll the market so that if
people could be

697
00:45:29,740 --> 00:45:32,670
at the the two companies to compete each
other and keep prices down didn't work

698
00:45:32,670 --> 00:45:33,390
out that loan

699
00:45:33,390 --> 00:45:36,509
in march back it's not outrageous but it
still by more than it should be my

700
00:45:36,510 --> 00:45:37,570
opinion you can

701
00:45:37,570 --> 00:45:42,280
you can pay as much as a forty dollars a
month I think in some areas

702
00:45:42,280 --> 00:45:46,050
just for the basic access just for the
right to use sale event at the cellular

703
00:45:46,050 --> 00:45:47,150
phone number

704
00:45:47,150 --> 00:45:50,340
turned on him I can be more in some
areas the country I'm

705
00:45:50,340 --> 00:45:53,730
natcher Carlos iván ecology make you
you still have to pay

706
00:45:53,730 --> 00:45:57,640
a per-minute charge on the
communications you make with them with

707
00:45:57,640 --> 00:45:57,940
you

708
00:45:57,940 --> 00:46:01,170
receive the call or make the call you're
still using a cell is Justin you might

709
00:46:01,170 --> 00:46:03,450
have to pay anywhere from ten cents to

710
00:46:03,450 --> 00:46:07,160
the in some areas then off-peak

711
00:46:07,160 --> 00:46:10,379
your time is as low as a nine cents I

712
00:46:10,380 --> 00:46:15,730
in other areas up here time which is in
philadelphia from my 7 p.m. to 9

713
00:46:15,730 --> 00:46:19,760
7 a.m. to 9 p.m. Pete I'm in Philly is
set

714
00:46:19,760 --> 00:46:22,800
than the rate plan you have the you can
be seventy

715
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:26,150
cents a minute in other areas it's it's
a little bit higher than

716
00:46:26,150 --> 00:46:29,910
summitted slower you had to call your
local so they carry fun with their rates

717
00:46:29,910 --> 00:46:30,220
are

718
00:46:30,220 --> 00:46:33,830
but you can see it could add up to few
hundred dollars a month use your phone

719
00:46:33,830 --> 00:46:35,710
for any minute I'm

720
00:46:35,710 --> 00:46:40,110
I'm see

721
00:46:40,110 --> 00:46:43,850
on I'll back on cellular fraud

722
00:46:43,850 --> 00:46:47,779
on the way anybody that what the way to
keep anybody can just buy a secular

723
00:46:47,780 --> 00:46:48,590
found in

724
00:46:48,590 --> 00:46:52,430
or stealing a shower found in and just
using and talking for a run in

725
00:46:52,430 --> 00:46:55,859
bring a bill so they would have to pay
is that each

726
00:46:55,860 --> 00:46:59,510
cellular telephone has on programmed
into it you know

727
00:46:59,510 --> 00:47:03,950
in Iran a read-only memory it an
electronic serial number that's unique

728
00:47:03,950 --> 00:47:06,020
to that particular telefilm

729
00:47:06,020 --> 00:47:09,690
it's an eight digit hexadecimal number
and

730
00:47:09,690 --> 00:47:12,760
the the first the two digits

731
00:47:12,760 --> 00:47:15,870
love the a tag to decimal digit define

732
00:47:15,870 --> 00:47:19,319
the manufacturer the fam for instance if
said

733
00:47:19,320 --> 00:47:23,090
it's a never even know it lol I know the
first two digits are eat E

734
00:47:23,090 --> 00:47:27,800
on for Motorola the labels on on this
one but two

735
00:47:27,800 --> 00:47:31,440
it very seldom on the bottom line is

736
00:47:31,440 --> 00:47:36,100
each other like Harry each sailor
manufacturer manufacturer

737
00:47:36,100 --> 00:47:39,800
as as can be differentiated from the
phone carriers the companies like nynex

738
00:47:39,800 --> 00:47:44,140
and so I wanna make fans they just buy
phones from Motorola ROKR Panasonic put

739
00:47:44,140 --> 00:47:45,629
their name on it but

740
00:47:45,630 --> 00:47:48,940
every found that you buy a matter what
company it's Ron is going to have a

741
00:47:48,940 --> 00:47:49,390
unique

742
00:47:49,390 --> 00:47:52,450
serial number programmed into it that
ostensibly you're not supposed to be

743
00:47:52,450 --> 00:47:53,670
able to change

744
00:47:53,670 --> 00:47:57,790
along with that number is the cellular
telephone number which is has an area

745
00:47:57,790 --> 00:47:59,290
code and exchange in

746
00:47:59,290 --> 00:48:03,070
last word it is just like a regular
phone also programmed into it

747
00:48:03,070 --> 00:48:06,260
that second phone number is usually
program into a

748
00:48:06,260 --> 00:48:09,620
into RAM memory which you can change on

749
00:48:09,620 --> 00:48:12,270
usually from the keyboard at the
fountain you're not supposed to know how

750
00:48:12,270 --> 00:48:13,490
to do that but

751
00:48:13,490 --> 00:48:16,620
on lifetimes in construction sure found
that tell you how to do that

752
00:48:16,620 --> 00:48:19,560
if you just change the phone number your
found it's not gonna work that out

753
00:48:19,560 --> 00:48:20,910
because what happens

754
00:48:20,910 --> 00:48:24,410
is there when used when you signed up
for sale a family the service you

755
00:48:24,410 --> 00:48:27,490
with this show your carrier you hershey
buyer found usually from

756
00:48:27,490 --> 00:48:31,500
a cycle a dealer who's affiliated want
them to carriers in your area

757
00:48:31,500 --> 00:48:34,730
they'll do credit check on you that
comes out okay

758
00:48:34,730 --> 00:48:38,550
then your sign a contract saying you'll
agree to pay the carrier

759
00:48:38,550 --> 00:48:41,640
ext dollars a month maybe 20-30 dollars
a month

760
00:48:41,640 --> 00:48:45,370
for basic access plus so much per minute
at their time

761
00:48:45,370 --> 00:48:49,180
which in some areas they do it at in six
second increments but in Milan area

762
00:48:49,180 --> 00:48:49,680
still

763
00:48:49,680 --> 00:48:53,299
one minute sick second-year man should
be preferable because if your calls

764
00:48:53,300 --> 00:48:57,570
one in six seconds on you only get one
in six seconds it has 22 minutes and

765
00:48:57,570 --> 00:48:59,870
over time they can add a line savings
but

766
00:48:59,870 --> 00:49:04,069
anyway on when you make your call the
first thing the founders is it sends its

767
00:49:04,070 --> 00:49:05,610
electronic serial number

768
00:49:05,610 --> 00:49:09,510
and the telephone number to than your
cell site

769
00:49:09,510 --> 00:49:13,000
and that in turn goes to the mobile
telephone switching office which

770
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:16,520
compares with the database to see yes
indeed

771
00:49:16,520 --> 00:49:20,390
you paid your bill and will process the
call on

772
00:49:20,390 --> 00:49:24,970
take questions and comments I'm if that
does not doesn't match if they don't see

773
00:49:24,970 --> 00:49:26,580
that number in their database

774
00:49:26,580 --> 00:49:30,200
or if they if there's some like the
phone number that it it's getting from

775
00:49:30,200 --> 00:49:31,700
you is not assigned

776
00:49:31,700 --> 00:49:34,880
but to be affiliated with a particular
electronic serial number it will not

777
00:49:34,880 --> 00:49:36,490
process the call

778
00:49:36,490 --> 00:49:40,280
now since each show you a carrier
maintained his own database and

779
00:49:40,280 --> 00:49:41,320
legitimate

780
00:49:41,320 --> 00:49:46,070
a electronic serial number slash
telephone number combinations for all

781
00:49:46,070 --> 00:49:47,400
their subscribers

782
00:49:47,400 --> 00:49:50,440
on up until a few years ago

783
00:49:50,440 --> 00:49:54,900
did each company only knew if you're
legitimate subscriber in your system

784
00:49:54,900 --> 00:49:58,270
if you're in that system if your from my
Center vicious

785
00:49:58,270 --> 00:50:01,810
San Francisco and came to manhattan it
ready to show you a fan

786
00:50:01,810 --> 00:50:05,580
it would know if you are legitimate
Schreiber not all good now is from the

787
00:50:05,580 --> 00:50:09,560
phone number area code your on a
subscriber on

788
00:50:09,560 --> 00:50:13,090
say at pacific bell's system in
California

789
00:50:13,090 --> 00:50:16,330
and it would just take your call on
every using a I found in a

790
00:50:16,330 --> 00:50:19,620
in system is not your home system the
money sign a contract with its called

791
00:50:19,620 --> 00:50:20,920
roaming

792
00:50:20,920 --> 00:50:24,020
and up until a few years ago you just
assume that if

793
00:50:24,020 --> 00:50:27,060
it on if it was with another Bell
carrier

794
00:50:27,060 --> 00:50:30,910
or carry had signed an agreement to two
were

795
00:50:30,910 --> 00:50:34,069
I the delusion is Shelly carriers will
make agreement with each other

796
00:50:34,070 --> 00:50:37,339
that will handle calls for your people
if you had no cause for our people and

797
00:50:37,339 --> 00:50:38,470
will work out the

798
00:50:38,470 --> 00:50:42,210
the billing you remember size will
reimburse you et cetera on

799
00:50:42,210 --> 00:50:45,440
but until they had all the systems went
together

800
00:50:45,440 --> 00:50:49,140
on it is with us in your ballot a rumor
he would process the call

801
00:50:49,140 --> 00:50:53,640
so well back in 1980s 6i believe it was

802
00:50:53,640 --> 00:50:56,839
a lot of people figured out that he just
program chin

803
00:50:56,839 --> 00:50:59,870
I your fam from the keypad which is
pretty easy to do

804
00:50:59,870 --> 00:51:02,720
actually back in eighty six la to thank
you can program the keypad get you had

805
00:51:02,720 --> 00:51:03,460
actually

806
00:51:03,460 --> 00:51:07,520
program that shit in the air on its
often which Kirk refer to is burning a

807
00:51:07,520 --> 00:51:08,380
prom

808
00:51:08,380 --> 00:51:12,140
ship to bring out the links in a in the
ship with a chip programmer

809
00:51:12,140 --> 00:51:15,589
but on if you change the phone number in
a secular found

810
00:51:15,589 --> 00:51:19,210
I to something other than your number
and went to another shitty

811
00:51:19,210 --> 00:51:22,810
often it would work and they would know
who to send the bill to because the

812
00:51:22,810 --> 00:51:24,799
phone number wouldn't come back to

813
00:51:24,800 --> 00:51:28,000
there was be a fake number somebody else
to get the bill the phone companies

814
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:30,000
really took a bath on that for a while

815
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:33,130
and they decided well we're gonna try to
put a stop to that in Sep social

816
00:51:33,130 --> 00:51:34,850
validation process

817
00:51:34,850 --> 00:51:38,900
and they started sharing data bases and
more recently they started

818
00:51:38,900 --> 00:51:42,890
networking that database so instead of
having to ship takes ran the country now

819
00:51:42,890 --> 00:51:43,879
they can

820
00:51:43,880 --> 00:51:48,200
be online and something called things
the reasons and thought I S 41 protocol

821
00:51:48,200 --> 00:51:51,300
I don't know what network they're saying
that information over his Zeman know

822
00:51:51,300 --> 00:51:52,920
that

823
00:51:52,920 --> 00:51:57,670
I guess not but there a it they can
nurse and the state a back and forth in

824
00:51:57,670 --> 00:51:59,859
real time if I take my phone to

825
00:51:59,859 --> 00:52:03,690
San Francisco and try to use it on it
will be able to validate

826
00:52:03,690 --> 00:52:08,020
on the the of authenticity of my found
an alleged a subscriber

827
00:52:08,020 --> 00:52:11,950
within the first few seconds the call
defined I'm not legitimate

828
00:52:11,950 --> 00:52:16,120
the thus the call will terminate or not
even start to get processed so

829
00:52:16,120 --> 00:52:19,520
the kinda put the fake the fake Rominger
I'm

830
00:52:19,520 --> 00:52:23,990
method of raw data business thirty years
ago what some people I figure had to do

831
00:52:23,990 --> 00:52:26,890
particularly with sometimes it is easier
than others he was a they made by

832
00:52:26,890 --> 00:52:27,940
Mitsubishi

833
00:52:27,940 --> 00:52:31,500
i think is gonna miss me 100 mile 800 if
the

834
00:52:31,500 --> 00:52:35,410
he put a special ron shipp into it it it
needed

835
00:52:35,410 --> 00:52:40,100
come up with the random electronic
serial number and phone number

836
00:52:40,100 --> 00:52:43,240
every time you turn it on so basically

837
00:52:43,240 --> 00:52:46,350
that free phone calls all the time but
those things don't work anymore most

838
00:52:46,350 --> 00:52:48,000
areas because a

839
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:51,609
even prove the software that at the
cellular companies to detect that in

840
00:52:51,609 --> 00:52:55,270
the yet the real time I medication no

841
00:52:55,270 --> 00:52:59,170
puts an end to it as well but sailor
fried his a

842
00:52:59,170 --> 00:53:02,300
become more sophisticated after that
when they

843
00:53:02,300 --> 00:53:07,410
when a pic by Sean on the fake roaming
and criminals had figured out

844
00:53:07,410 --> 00:53:10,589
how to intercept these electronic serial
numbers

845
00:53:10,589 --> 00:53:14,279
and phone number pairs we have to get
both member if you get both numbers

846
00:53:14,280 --> 00:53:19,520
matching to get them to work so what
some people I think I had to intercept

847
00:53:19,520 --> 00:53:23,080
what's called the reverse control
channel which is the the channel

848
00:53:23,080 --> 00:53:26,529
the frequency that being sent from the
sailor found

849
00:53:26,530 --> 00:53:29,609
to than your cell site which were
initially send these to coach the

850
00:53:29,609 --> 00:53:33,799
to the local repeater MSN to the mobile
telephone switching else

851
00:53:33,800 --> 00:53:36,859
system for switching office

852
00:53:36,859 --> 00:53:40,220
for analysis if you have a radio
receiver you can pick up the signal see

853
00:53:40,220 --> 00:53:42,440
if you're eligible close to where the

854
00:53:42,440 --> 00:53:45,850
the fans are so a crime some criminals
it is the side im set up a

855
00:53:45,850 --> 00:53:49,450
specialized radio receiver not on like
this one manufactured by Ikon

856
00:53:49,450 --> 00:53:50,550
corporation

857
00:53:50,550 --> 00:53:53,740
I along with their computer and some
other equipment that would allow you to

858
00:53:53,740 --> 00:53:55,030
actually be modulated

859
00:53:55,030 --> 00:53:58,690
data which sounds like a.m. said roughly
it

860
00:53:58,690 --> 00:54:03,370
10,000 baht and air its you keep you
here it just sounds like a buzzing noise

861
00:54:03,370 --> 00:54:05,400
in fact I can probably

862
00:54:05,400 --> 00:54:12,400
lay here with the year data sounds like
a second here

863
00:54:12,500 --> 00:54:16,989
saying

864
00:54:16,989 --> 00:54:18,600
all

865
00:54:18,600 --> 00:54:22,290
I'm going through who's online carrier
in in the bell in this

866
00:54:22,290 --> 00:54:27,110
areas a sailor one okay my see if I can
pick up there

867
00:54:27,110 --> 00:54:31,410
I now her nynex is a

868
00:54:31,410 --> 00:54:38,410
and

869
00:54:38,900 --> 00:54:45,900
not to pick up the the four channel
there again

870
00:54:46,770 --> 00:54:49,820
okay enough to make up for the speaker
let you hear what the data sounds like

871
00:54:49,820 --> 00:54:53,610
from the initial paging channel on the
nynex system

872
00:54:53,610 --> 00:54:57,240
and this is basically sending out a
signal I

873
00:54:57,240 --> 00:55:00,760
in this area to also Calif and saying

874
00:55:00,760 --> 00:55:03,840
if you pick this signal op SMU signal
back

875
00:55:03,840 --> 00:55:07,020
and we'll find a channel to put you on
this not being used by someone else's

876
00:55:07,020 --> 00:55:07,930
with that sounds like

877
00:55:07,930 --> 00:55:13,070
do

878
00:55:13,070 --> 00:55:16,300
not replace the list too says into but
some people it's been

879
00:55:16,300 --> 00:55:21,580
music to the ears I'm this is this

880
00:55:21,580 --> 00:55:25,400
is a data stream that is not encrypt it
is if you have the same a

881
00:55:25,400 --> 00:55:29,040
equipment to be modulated data stream
it's not terribly difficult to deal

882
00:55:29,040 --> 00:55:32,660
on you can use this data for illicit
purposes now that's

883
00:55:32,660 --> 00:55:36,140
is it very minus was the four control
channel you're hearing this is not this

884
00:55:36,140 --> 00:55:36,770
is a

885
00:55:36,770 --> 00:55:40,600
does not contain the electronic serial
numbers in I does contain phone numbers

886
00:55:40,600 --> 00:55:44,230
on but without electronics your members
which are only sent from the fans to the

887
00:55:44,230 --> 00:55:44,970
cell sites

888
00:55:44,970 --> 00:55:48,410
on having that their phone numbers and
gonna do you any good if you want to

889
00:55:48,410 --> 00:55:49,160
commit fraud

890
00:55:49,160 --> 00:55:52,250
I'm to commit fraud you need to get a
receiver or

891
00:55:52,250 --> 00:55:57,200
a specialized devices company Qatar
Curtis I like your devices

892
00:55:57,200 --> 00:56:01,590
in a man be California their phone
numbers sherry cook for 15

893
00:56:01,590 --> 00:56:07,270
964 3846 they make a device called a a
cell phone yes in return for

894
00:56:07,270 --> 00:56:10,890
about thirteen hundred dollars which is
the

895
00:56:10,890 --> 00:56:15,720
the numbers every kid 415 964

896
00:56:15,720 --> 00:56:19,730
9846 that that device is designed for

897
00:56:19,730 --> 00:56:23,080
cellular dealers and installers on

898
00:56:23,080 --> 00:56:26,720
what time someone comes with the seller
found in the its they've had it's like

899
00:56:26,720 --> 00:56:27,620
an alternate

900
00:56:27,620 --> 00:56:30,970
now an activator for a long time the and
they want to get it

901
00:56:30,970 --> 00:56:34,000
I'll take questions at the end I don't

902
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:38,180
on somebody comes into a dealership me
when I get there found activated it when

903
00:56:38,180 --> 00:56:40,550
they don't already in they have an
activator for a while

904
00:56:40,550 --> 00:56:44,440
in a if the label is not this your
number isn't is invisibly stamped on her

905
00:56:44,440 --> 00:56:46,030
person and have the paperwork for

906
00:56:46,030 --> 00:56:49,600
to find out what the electron actual
number that foundation you can use when

907
00:56:49,600 --> 00:56:50,490
these devices

908
00:56:50,490 --> 00:56:53,880
I'm just holding it near the fountain
and try it on and it will it will

909
00:56:53,880 --> 00:56:57,410
it will pick up their initial data
stream is being transmitted on

910
00:56:57,410 --> 00:57:01,490
on now roughly 800 anywhere between
eight and 35 and 55

911
00:57:01,490 --> 00:57:06,100
megahertz and will decode and display it
on the unit as well as the phone number

912
00:57:06,100 --> 00:57:09,100
that unit said it's picking up that same
information would be sent to

913
00:57:09,100 --> 00:57:13,030
the cell site when you turn your phone
on and that information can be proach

914
00:57:13,030 --> 00:57:16,260
program into a sailor found with special

915
00:57:16,260 --> 00:57:20,500
software to enable you to duplicator
clone

916
00:57:20,500 --> 00:57:24,120
that sailor fancy that's what people
decided to take advantage over there

917
00:57:24,120 --> 00:57:27,810
their case histories of the people being
busted with that one these devices

918
00:57:27,810 --> 00:57:28,370
hidden in a

919
00:57:28,370 --> 00:57:31,710
in a dominoes pizza box getting on a
busy intersection picking up

920
00:57:31,710 --> 00:57:35,250
I'm sale telephone serial numbers in and
phone numbers

921
00:57:35,250 --> 00:57:38,490
and age really got the they sell your
industry upset

922
00:57:38,490 --> 00:57:43,150
because in didn't really have much
defense against this

923
00:57:43,150 --> 00:57:46,550
when the sailor originals amps I

924
00:57:46,550 --> 00:57:49,790
telephone specifications were put
together a

925
00:57:49,790 --> 00:57:53,970
am prolly 10-15 years ago for cellular
on

926
00:57:53,970 --> 00:57:57,600
wanna the that requirements for this
phone manufacturers was it

927
00:57:57,600 --> 00:58:01,390
electronics you remember should not be
readily all triple

928
00:58:01,390 --> 00:58:04,879
in a sec you'll tell them and a lot a
company said

929
00:58:04,880 --> 00:58:09,280
sorted came up with their own definition
of what rarely all terrible

930
00:58:09,280 --> 00:58:13,690
was actually going to mean on some sale
if I manufacturers made it

931
00:58:13,690 --> 00:58:17,390
pretty difficult to deal which obviously
we take more time to figure out to make

932
00:58:17,390 --> 00:58:18,080
it difficult

933
00:58:18,080 --> 00:58:21,410
or they just made it really easy to do
because if they could know where he was

934
00:58:21,410 --> 00:58:22,720
born after having a profound

935
00:58:22,720 --> 00:58:25,720
they did know about people like Mike
she's

936
00:58:25,720 --> 00:58:29,410
haha on what a

937
00:58:29,410 --> 00:58:33,040
some people use some other companies use
in ice

938
00:58:33,040 --> 00:58:36,500
some sorta I wouldn't really call
encryption algorithm so much is a

939
00:58:36,500 --> 00:58:39,960
I just looks at different addresses in
the fan for for different parts and

940
00:58:39,960 --> 00:58:41,860
electronics you remember instead of them
being in a

941
00:58:41,860 --> 00:58:45,030
in a nice little memory address you
define those eight

942
00:58:45,030 --> 00:58:48,740
X decimal digits but on by people hack
this dow

943
00:58:48,740 --> 00:58:53,060
stuff and figured out but with different
phone models have 30 s and what memory

944
00:58:53,060 --> 00:58:53,910
addresses in

945
00:58:53,910 --> 00:58:57,910
and I had a great information to that
memory addresses that that Franken

946
00:58:57,910 --> 00:59:01,330
then beach its agony can be changed come

947
00:59:01,330 --> 00:59:04,750
be a the interception of their

948
00:59:04,750 --> 00:59:07,960
these electronics you remember slash
telephone numbers has become a

949
00:59:07,960 --> 00:59:11,590
most prevalent in and really big
metropolitan areas like

950
00:59:11,590 --> 00:59:14,830
New York Los Angeles I Miami

951
00:59:14,830 --> 00:59:18,049
on it's a lot more prevalent in those
areas in in fact

952
00:59:18,050 --> 00:59:22,520
I read offenses were even just street
gangs who had traditionally

953
00:59:22,520 --> 00:59:25,890
made a lot of their money from the sale
of the

954
00:59:25,890 --> 00:59:30,040
drugs had found out that it an even
safer

955
00:59:30,040 --> 00:59:33,140
and more lucrative former revenue was to
provide

956
00:59:33,140 --> 00:59:36,160
bogus electronics you remember phone
number to subscribers

957
00:59:36,160 --> 00:59:39,210
and it has been cases affair a

958
00:59:39,210 --> 00:59:43,420
you know gangs and so forth that
providing this is a service to

959
00:59:43,420 --> 00:59:46,440
to people on the street setting up a a
computer

960
00:59:46,440 --> 00:59:49,760
on in there in a car

961
00:59:49,760 --> 00:59:52,040
you would just drive into a parking lot
or something where people would know

962
00:59:52,040 --> 00:59:53,770
they would never to meet them

963
00:59:53,770 --> 00:59:57,790
and the plug the computer into a
person's found an upload a

964
00:59:57,790 --> 01:00:01,009
a a stone electronic serial number and
phone number into the

965
01:00:01,010 --> 01:00:04,830
into their customers found for a flat
fee i cant

966
01:00:04,830 --> 01:00:07,840
a hundred dollars are two hundred
dollars or whatever one's

967
01:00:07,840 --> 01:00:12,310
and this required no real expense on
their part they were buying a

968
01:00:12,310 --> 01:00:17,180
I a rock products for resale like like
they were with drug was like an infinite

969
01:00:17,180 --> 01:00:20,360
resource was free to just pick a matter
the air on

970
01:00:20,360 --> 01:00:24,020
after about a month or two when that
person's

971
01:00:24,020 --> 01:00:26,800
she remembered tho number had been
abused in the real person who works as a

972
01:00:26,800 --> 01:00:28,110
sign is numbers

973
01:00:28,110 --> 01:00:32,100
got their phone bill that relies on the
Ghana ten thousand dollar found bill

974
01:00:32,100 --> 01:00:32,640
with the

975
01:00:32,640 --> 01:00:36,310
calls to Haiti and South American

976
01:00:36,310 --> 01:00:39,509
and Europe wherever that I did make
these calls

977
01:00:39,510 --> 01:00:43,210
and the phone company when and from
carrier would would end up eating those

978
01:00:43,210 --> 01:00:47,500
charges and have to change that person's
say like telephone number

979
01:00:47,500 --> 01:00:50,400
on they change the phone number the
electronics you remember what a rain the

980
01:00:50,400 --> 01:00:51,500
same but remember

981
01:00:51,500 --> 01:00:54,780
to change the phone number at the
computer and it then

982
01:00:54,780 --> 01:00:58,100
at the unit at that compound company and
and on the phone and

983
01:00:58,100 --> 01:01:02,970
on the old purloined electronic chill
number will no longer work it will be

984
01:01:02,970 --> 01:01:03,630
transmitting

985
01:01:03,630 --> 01:01:07,500
the new correct tho number with it so be
on a business

986
01:01:07,500 --> 01:01:10,960
and some say really carries it made it a
point to it to you what they found out

987
01:01:10,960 --> 01:01:11,660
fraud was

988
01:01:11,660 --> 01:01:14,890
with one particular phone number she
remember was being stolen use

989
01:01:14,890 --> 01:01:19,020
but they would dare monitor the the
activity on that

990
01:01:19,020 --> 01:01:22,900
account to maybe get an idea of who is
committing the fraud

991
01:01:22,900 --> 01:01:26,270
they've had their very success with that
a lotta times

992
01:01:26,270 --> 01:01:29,160
I what they would do is just simply call
the phone numbers that showed up on the

993
01:01:29,160 --> 01:01:29,879
bill and

994
01:01:29,880 --> 01:01:33,630
say who called you on this time and date
and amazingly

995
01:01:33,630 --> 01:01:37,940
a lot of people that convicted just on
that on that basis

996
01:01:37,940 --> 01:01:41,400
on i think is a recent case were

997
01:01:41,400 --> 01:01:44,960
I'm your said

998
01:01:44,960 --> 01:01:49,210
famous singer a few months ago %uh like
singer's father was sacked

999
01:01:49,210 --> 01:01:52,420
forget that the singer's name some
celebrities and his father was was

1000
01:01:52,420 --> 01:01:54,170
murdered son some high when

in the car was stolen and people read
Michael Jordan that's right a West

1002
01:01:58,440 --> 01:02:02,600
not a singer and I just knew is some
celebrity michael's other gathering

1003
01:02:02,600 --> 01:02:06,820
got a great voice that doesn t I michael
jordan's father was murdered

1004
01:02:06,820 --> 01:02:10,470
and the person who stole his car it is
still a scar

1005
01:02:10,470 --> 01:02:14,430
on guided cited a college girlfriend for
michael jordan's car

1006

1008
01:02:22,610 --> 01:02:25,950

warrants in other words a

1015
01:02:46,560 --> 01:02:51,160

chance to there's real security from

1018
01:02:59,040 --> 01:02:59,759
their respective

1019
01:02:59,760 --> 01:03:03,560
if if you even are using a share living
legitimately in

1020
01:03:03,560 --> 01:03:06,900
don't want to know that don't want
anyone to know you're calling certain

1021
01:03:06,900 --> 01:03:07,750
film numbers

1022
01:03:07,750 --> 01:03:11,020
don't call from a secular found one can
easily monitor into on

1023
01:03:11,020 --> 01:03:15,420
the the numbers are right he's in our
rarely given out anyone who calls the

1024
01:03:15,420 --> 01:03:19,230
on is this friendly with the very people
the cellular phone company

1025
01:03:19,230 --> 01:03:23,400
cell on and how they trace this to let
ex-girlfriend in the girlfriend was

1026
01:03:23,400 --> 01:03:24,390
pressured in

1027
01:03:24,390 --> 01:03:27,730
she gave it the guys name unfortunately
they got the guys in to wear

1028
01:03:27,730 --> 01:03:31,290
kill this person but anyway it is give
goes to show how easy this is done

1029
01:03:31,290 --> 01:03:32,120
another

1030
01:03:32,120 --> 01:03:35,870
another example love no is kinda
surveillance

1031
01:03:35,870 --> 01:03:39,080
I is the OJ Simpson case now we hope to
have someone come

1032
01:03:39,080 --> 01:03:42,380
with actual audio tapes the

1033
01:03:42,380 --> 01:03:46,130
OJ Simpson cellular telephone calls
during this

1034
01:03:46,130 --> 01:03:49,620
a little escape route on the highway in
at now west coast

1035
01:03:49,620 --> 01:03:55,060
but that the person without a car that
can show what but a

1036
01:03:55,060 --> 01:04:00,680
I'm sorry now on I heard an excerpt from
that on the BBC on shortwave

1037
01:04:00,680 --> 01:04:04,200
seven months ago and I recorded it and
wanted to bring it with me

1038
01:04:04,200 --> 01:04:08,110
but I couldn't find a tape on

1039
01:04:08,110 --> 01:04:10,810
but I was pretty interesting in fact it
did the special is that was interviewed

1040
01:04:10,810 --> 01:04:12,100
on the BBC

1041
01:04:12,100 --> 01:04:16,510
on came to conclusion but the type of
monitoring that was being done

1042
01:04:16,510 --> 01:04:20,360
love Prince Charles and Lady Diana was

1043
01:04:20,360 --> 01:04:23,970
not by a typical scanner type: user that
there was there

1044
01:04:23,970 --> 01:04:28,930
opinion that on the they listen to
recordings Inc including was probably

1045
01:04:28,930 --> 01:04:30,480
done by someone at the

1046
01:04:30,480 --> 01:04:33,590
at the telephone company or by
government agency

1047
01:04:33,590 --> 01:04:37,910
up there are people who really had the
ability to monitor things as well as

1048
01:04:37,910 --> 01:04:39,049
they were monitored

1049
01:04:39,050 --> 01:04:42,330
but that was just conjecture on this
expert spartan BB say so

1050
01:04:42,330 --> 01:04:45,460
can I say on so well

1051
01:04:45,460 --> 01:04:49,710
lot of fans are being a are lot of phone
customer sale if investors being ripped

1052
01:04:49,710 --> 01:04:50,910
off from this sir

1053
01:04:50,910 --> 01:04:55,129
this cloning thing now calling in and of
itself I don't think is a bad thing

1054
01:04:55,130 --> 01:04:57,950
on that issue for Friday think it's a
bad thing but there are a lot of

1055
01:04:57,950 --> 01:05:01,220
perfectly legitimate applications for
cloning a fan but taking electronics

1056
01:05:01,220 --> 01:05:02,680
cell number account number

1057
01:05:02,680 --> 01:05:06,170
from one found in pretty in another fam
princess I have a a

1058
01:05:06,170 --> 01:05:09,990
iPhone installed in my car this is a
Motorola

1059
01:05:09,990 --> 01:05:13,240
I think I took the case out cover of as
you can see with the circuit he looks

1060
01:05:13,240 --> 01:05:13,580
like

1061
01:05:13,580 --> 01:05:18,180
after reading cannot take a look at this
if you want this is a a Motorola

1062
01:05:18,180 --> 01:05:22,080
a typical installed car them and also
they sell this is a bag phone in a

1063
01:05:22,080 --> 01:05:24,140
little carrying bag in Cary shoulder

1064
01:05:24,140 --> 01:05:27,609
unlike the portable phones that are that
are a hand-held

1065
01:05:27,610 --> 01:05:31,330
the car fans independent political
transportable a back fence transmitted

1066
01:05:31,330 --> 01:05:33,660
an actual power for three watch which is

1067
01:05:33,660 --> 01:05:37,180
a five times greater determine the Latin
that's why sometimes with a portable

1068
01:05:37,180 --> 01:05:40,260
thank you get lousy reception some
theories but with one in the car

1069
01:05:40,260 --> 01:05:43,620
get better results for your you have
wanna better in 10 on the car than a

1070
01:05:43,620 --> 01:05:43,960
little

1071
01:05:43,960 --> 01:05:48,970
rubber ducky minor on your own portable
and you deal with Reliance Power is five

1072
01:05:48,970 --> 01:05:50,310
times more

1073
01:05:50,310 --> 01:05:55,250
so on a these car fans

1074
01:05:55,250 --> 01:05:58,470
and if I have one of these phones in my
car

1075
01:05:58,470 --> 01:06:03,010
and I want help with my other car only
drive one car to time

1076
01:06:03,010 --> 01:06:06,650
or from I got a portable fan now I would
have to go back

1077
01:06:06,650 --> 01:06:10,940
to my cellular carrier and say one other
fan or if I bought a phone use from

1078
01:06:10,940 --> 01:06:12,030
newspaper something

1079
01:06:12,030 --> 01:06:15,080
Sabaton I wanna get another phone
numbers I like I want to use this other

1080
01:06:15,080 --> 01:06:15,790
found

1081
01:06:15,790 --> 01:06:18,779
can I get it done gonna get it set up on
the same number already have an account

1082
01:06:18,780 --> 01:06:20,570
with you can I just now have

1083
01:06:20,570 --> 01:06:24,220
the second found a sign the same phone
number in now only be using my phone in

1084
01:06:24,220 --> 01:06:24,860
time

1085
01:06:24,860 --> 01:06:28,150
to look at the cellular carriers will
not let you do this and they would say

1086
01:06:28,150 --> 01:06:31,200
well you have to get a second phone
number and here's another

1087
01:06:31,200 --> 01:06:33,890
twenty thirty forty dollars a month for
access even if you don't use that other

1088
01:06:33,890 --> 01:06:34,850
found

1089
01:06:34,850 --> 01:06:39,000
it would its it analogous to what the a

1090
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:42,110
I was 18 she would do pre divestiture
and

1091
01:06:42,110 --> 01:06:45,180
charge you I a monthly fee

1092
01:06:45,180 --> 01:06:50,040
for every phone in your house regardless
if if there is all the same phone number

1093
01:06:50,040 --> 01:06:53,080
being allowed to anywhere in my phone is
playing your house

1094
01:06:53,080 --> 01:06:56,580
you have to pay more you stop paying
your phone bill I'm

1095
01:06:56,580 --> 01:06:59,950
I feeling a lot of people in the hacker
community feel

1096
01:06:59,950 --> 01:07:03,330
you're paying your phone bill I should
you have to pay extra just for having

1097
01:07:03,330 --> 01:07:06,520
more than one found you're not a failure
causing air time

1098
01:07:06,520 --> 01:07:10,540
so what live people enterprising people
have figured out that

1099
01:07:10,540 --> 01:07:13,750
and its I decided is perfectly
legitimate to take

1100
01:07:13,750 --> 01:07:17,210
phone number at over for a number like
actual number at over

1101
01:07:17,210 --> 01:07:20,370
one found you put it in another fan

1102
01:07:20,370 --> 01:07:23,630
and the difficulty in doing that is

1103
01:07:23,630 --> 01:07:26,780
difficulty in applying that is that

1104
01:07:26,780 --> 01:07:30,910
the secular system I detection

1105
01:07:30,910 --> 01:07:34,630
up that the seller sale a phone is being
used to nose the to this phone number

1106
01:07:34,630 --> 01:07:35,920
this yes and

1107
01:07:35,920 --> 01:07:39,370
and found members being used at this
moment if it detects on the system

1108
01:07:39,370 --> 01:07:42,859
in another cell site or in the same cell
site that another family that seems to

1109
01:07:42,860 --> 01:07:44,410
remember five members being used

1110
01:07:44,410 --> 01:07:47,690
it's going to their cell phone companies
going to assume that someone has

1111
01:07:47,690 --> 01:07:49,220
illegally purloined

1112
01:07:49,220 --> 01:07:52,860
that that number pair and is there
trying to rip you off so they will

1113
01:07:52,860 --> 01:07:56,470
in most military is their software
installed at the secular system that can

1114
01:07:56,470 --> 01:07:59,970
the tactician it'll flag Etten it'll
shut their phone number of

1115
01:07:59,970 --> 01:08:03,150
in which case a you had to go to carrier
and

1116
01:08:03,150 --> 01:08:07,450
if you're why should you say hey i phone
stopped working what's going on

1117
01:08:07,450 --> 01:08:10,680
and they woulda reassigned a new phone
number for your for your fanny

1118
01:08:10,680 --> 01:08:14,990
wish they were program into any bill
Harmon been cloned the new phone number

1119
01:08:14,990 --> 01:08:15,900
in your other found

1120
01:08:15,900 --> 01:08:18,950
I just don't make the same mistake again
a bite having both died at the same time

1121
01:08:18,950 --> 01:08:25,010
it can take an attack that

1122
01:08:25,010 --> 01:08:29,970
so on Dec I try doing nada get the night
I cloned

1123
01:08:29,970 --> 01:08:33,799
additional attraction remember to number
other the Novatel hand-held found

1124
01:08:33,799 --> 01:08:38,130
abs when there's a stone last night into
a Motorola bag telephone

1125
01:08:38,130 --> 01:08:43,500
and got it to work and I think it will
happen if actually had one phone on I

1126
01:08:43,500 --> 01:08:44,260
tried it

1127
01:08:44,260 --> 01:08:47,280
on use the other one so I call the 2200
offices

1128
01:08:47,279 --> 01:08:51,679
inner on the one found I got the
voicemail system actually on my normal

1129
01:08:51,680 --> 01:08:53,330
families have an account on

1130
01:08:53,330 --> 01:08:56,359
and you know had it my I was listening
to the

1131
01:08:56,359 --> 01:08:59,480
you know the greeting message in the
boys bulletin board then I call this the

1132
01:08:59,480 --> 01:09:00,049
number

1133
01:09:00,049 --> 01:09:03,350
on the client found and

1134
01:09:03,350 --> 01:09:07,180
the call went through in the clone found
after the clone fine with Motorola I

1135
01:09:07,180 --> 01:09:09,020
think I called first on the yet

1136
01:09:09,020 --> 01:09:12,470
a call for Sina Motorola phone which was
I had originally had a different number

1137
01:09:12,470 --> 01:09:13,500
in it

1138
01:09:13,500 --> 01:09:16,529
and the phone company assumed it was the
Novatel found it had the like

1139
01:09:16,529 --> 01:09:19,269
know what else electronic serial number
in the Motorola phone the call went

1140
01:09:19,270 --> 01:09:21,140
through file it on speaker phone

1141
01:09:21,140 --> 01:09:24,250
and then I called the voicemail system
with

1142
01:09:24,250 --> 01:09:27,319
the portable fan and what happened was
the

1143
01:09:27,319 --> 01:09:30,839
I the call went through in a portable
fan and

1144
01:09:30,839 --> 01:09:34,600
the other one stop working soon as the
call started going on this one so this

1145
01:09:34,600 --> 01:09:38,299
I know then that on a the Atlantic mall
system in philadelphia

1146
01:09:38,299 --> 01:09:42,299
on they have software they will
immediately shut down the second one so

1147
01:09:42,299 --> 01:09:46,049
I don't know what their set up a red
flag fen still works actually want no

1148
01:09:46,049 --> 01:09:49,140
tomorrow works for that on their phone
and I had a phone anymore but

1149
01:09:49,140 --> 01:09:53,480
on if they shut it off on want to go to
them and say

1150
01:09:53,480 --> 01:09:57,260
you might happen so on

1151
01:09:57,260 --> 01:10:00,290
if anyone is interested in actually
doing this on

1152
01:10:00,290 --> 01:10:03,920
I have provide software on have net here

1153
01:10:03,920 --> 01:10:07,500
to allow people to change the electronic
serial number

1154
01:10:07,500 --> 01:10:11,670
other cellular phone a sensibly I'm
hoping that they would only put the

1155
01:10:11,670 --> 01:10:14,600
electronic serial number in phone number
one thing that they're all religion

1156
01:10:14,600 --> 01:10:17,720
authorized to use injured other found so
they can

1157
01:10:17,720 --> 01:10:21,980
pay one monthly access fee incentive no
a redundant monthly access fee

1158
01:10:21,980 --> 01:10:25,070
on it on a directory called the

1159
01:10:25,070 --> 01:10:28,290
I think it said this before sell soft
and the people the network

1160
01:10:28,290 --> 01:10:31,920
at Operations Center can help you down
though that if you have to know how to

1161
01:10:31,920 --> 01:10:32,910
do it yourself

1162
01:10:32,910 --> 01:10:36,490
$700k have code I have

1163
01:10:36,490 --> 01:10:40,780
materials my table here at the end with
all the

1164
01:10:40,780 --> 01:10:44,860
a radio receiving equipment up showing
you how to make the cable

1165
01:10:44,860 --> 01:10:48,370
the tech connect between a cellular
phone and your

1166
01:10:48,370 --> 01:10:51,510
your PC to actually accomplish this
there are companies that will sell those

1167
01:10:51,510 --> 01:10:53,550
cables she'll unfortunately the not

1168
01:10:53,550 --> 01:10:56,130
they're not inexpensive but I'll give
you the phone number the company that

1169
01:10:56,130 --> 01:10:57,710
sells these cables

1170
01:10:57,710 --> 01:11:00,870
called california great find
communications

1171
01:11:00,870 --> 01:11:04,910
there at No Laguna Hills Calif

1172
01:11:04,910 --> 01:11:10,220
telephone number up now the toll-free
number 800 457

1173
01:11:10,220 --> 01:11:14,100
45 56 my own ass for greg is very
helpful

1174
01:11:14,100 --> 01:11:19,640
and he has found from yet I again it's a
repeat 30 104

1175
01:11:19,640 --> 01:11:24,910
57 45 56 by using the software that's
available free on

1176
01:11:24,910 --> 01:11:28,450
hope net and these cables you can
program a

1177
01:11:28,450 --> 01:11:32,580
and in various sale telephone certain
Motorola models

1178
01:11:32,580 --> 01:11:37,170
Panasonic I Mitsubishi I some Radio
Shack fans

1179
01:11:37,170 --> 01:11:40,200
now each found a different actor
something you can just plug in your

1180
01:11:40,200 --> 01:11:43,670
connector nasa the found others yet
attached to a chip that inside the fam

1181
01:11:43,670 --> 01:11:46,430
but regardless you can buy a lot this
year in cables from him they vary in

1182
01:11:46,430 --> 01:11:49,640
price from eight hundred dollars up to a
couple hundred dollars for the cables

1183
01:11:49,640 --> 01:11:53,010
you can probably make one for a few
dollars in parts and I had that

1184
01:11:53,010 --> 01:11:56,490
information available on our table

1185
01:11:56,490 --> 01:11:59,290
are ya right you'll get the cable guy
and you're doing that if if you're not

1186
01:11:59,290 --> 01:12:00,269
really

1187
01:12:00,270 --> 01:12:04,760
a good side over and haven't ever bill
any kind of electronic able before you

1188
01:12:04,760 --> 01:12:07,180
might want to be a better off buying the
cables

1189
01:12:07,180 --> 01:12:10,600
in that time will be from around track
is sometimes there there's

1190
01:12:10,600 --> 01:12:13,520
fine connector he got a shot himself a
good solder just by all means make

1191
01:12:13,520 --> 01:12:15,410
yourself and you can do the whole thing
for

1192
01:12:15,410 --> 01:12:22,410
a few bucks but not

1193
01:12:23,920 --> 01:12:27,150
I yeah that's right

1194
01:12:27,150 --> 01:12:30,309
if you've never use a soldering iron
before do not try this at home

1195
01:12:30,310 --> 01:12:33,430
and he will you won't you'll have any
like it is just not going out to work

1196
01:12:33,430 --> 01:12:34,270
believe me

1197
01:12:34,270 --> 01:12:37,750
I'm want the other things I found is
this software is very picky in regards

1198
01:12:37,750 --> 01:12:38,430
to

1199
01:12:38,430 --> 01:12:42,160
the parallel printer interface that it
interfaces with

1200
01:12:42,160 --> 01:12:45,950
on you if you're using a high-speed
computer

1201
01:12:45,950 --> 01:12:49,710
turn the turbo mode of work that can you
it can slow the did

1202
01:12:49,710 --> 01:12:52,760
I speed down making a slow as possible

1203
01:12:52,760 --> 01:12:56,040
that works very well along with the ex
teason 286 is

1204
01:12:56,040 --> 01:13:00,140
and 36 but if you while wanna run on a
46-year penny anyone to try to slow

1205
01:13:00,140 --> 01:13:01,800
damper editor promote

1206
01:13:01,800 --> 01:13:05,080
if you have a laptop you can change this
be making a slow as possible

1207
01:13:05,080 --> 01:13:08,410
I some

1208
01:13:08,410 --> 01:13:13,990
I'm sorry I don't have software on the
net to lie to do this for Macintosh

1209
01:13:13,990 --> 01:13:17,010
ally see any legal well you have
difficulty doing that that you will you

1210
01:13:17,010 --> 01:13:18,760
make it stop it won't be would be
ligated

1211
01:13:18,760 --> 01:13:22,270
interface to defend because max don't
have parallel printer port on them

1212
01:13:22,270 --> 01:13:26,440
I'm you well okay I don't know I haven't
tried it

1213
01:13:26,440 --> 01:13:30,090
I don't have a Mac you can try it you
can try for free so

1214
01:13:30,090 --> 01:13:35,430
no great now I appreciate knowing at

1215
01:13:35,430 --> 01:13:39,400
exactly lets the that's the the the it
the trouble with some other parallel

1216
01:13:39,400 --> 01:13:40,560
printer port if

1217
01:13:40,560 --> 01:13:43,890
on there are different types apparel a
printer for summer

1218
01:13:43,890 --> 01:13:47,610
arse I'll one direction or summer by
directional

1219
01:13:47,610 --> 01:13:50,650
summer faster than others and so forth
and

1220
01:13:50,650 --> 01:13:54,060
while parallel printer poorest are
supposed to be standardized

1221
01:13:54,060 --> 01:13:58,180
we find there's a lot of variations
between African Peters I have

1222
01:13:58,180 --> 01:14:01,990
but I've got a computer store supply
computers have a margin but the standard

1223
01:14:01,990 --> 01:14:04,110
parallel printer cards for like ten
dollars

1224
01:14:04,110 --> 01:14:08,190
and some other marks another down I
found no I even found you by the same

1225
01:14:08,190 --> 01:14:11,080
and if it's a mile se manufacture one
work and one didn't

1226
01:14:11,080 --> 01:14:13,700
they work fine with the printer but
didn't work for the software so you may

1227
01:14:13,700 --> 01:14:16,309
have to go through public appears a
couple a printer ports

1228
01:14:16,310 --> 01:14:19,960
before you find one that will actually
work but you just have to fool around

1229
01:14:19,960 --> 01:14:22,440
it. it to work it's what happens all
about

1230
01:14:22,440 --> 01:14:28,140
from up

1231
01:14:28,140 --> 01:14:32,170
on so we're I try let you folks know
about myself a

1232
01:14:32,170 --> 01:14:35,460
on the line here and I

1233
01:14:35,460 --> 01:14:39,210
show you how easy it is to intercept the
sale telephone call on

1234
01:14:39,210 --> 01:14:43,010
I will say that I E im not going to do
this

1235
01:14:43,010 --> 01:14:46,790
intentionally I'm gonna search for some
sort of interference that

1236
01:14:46,790 --> 01:14:51,460
I i heard on not over the table and I he
my aunt booth was very close a sale

1237
01:14:51,460 --> 01:14:52,660
telephone frequency

1238
01:14:52,660 --> 01:14:55,090
and if I happen in its official
telephone call on looking for this

1239
01:14:55,090 --> 01:14:56,390
interference source then

1240
01:14:56,390 --> 01:15:00,420
alternate of preseason so

1241
01:15:00,420 --> 01:15:05,280
you'll have to listen to this I'll
mention that the reason it is illegal

1242
01:15:05,280 --> 01:15:08,940
is a Congress in 1986 passed a law
called the Electronic Communications

1243
01:15:08,940 --> 01:15:10,550
Privacy Act

1244
01:15:10,550 --> 01:15:14,820
which other I'm sorry you could call it
that

1245
01:15:14,820 --> 01:15:18,340
and called you call a disclaimer the
1986 Congress passed the

1246
01:15:18,340 --> 01:15:21,480
a lock on the Electronic Communications
Privacy Act and

1247
01:15:21,480 --> 01:15:24,480
that had a lot a provision in it one of
them

1248
01:15:24,480 --> 01:15:27,570
which was a heavily loaded but lobby by
the shale industry

1249
01:15:27,570 --> 01:15:31,500
to make it illegal to intercepts a live
telephone

1250
01:15:31,500 --> 01:15:36,490
conversations now that's a very
difficult if not impossible lot 14 said

1251
01:15:36,490 --> 01:15:38,700
I'm against any law that can't be
enforced

1252
01:15:38,700 --> 01:15:41,700
on because it is no point we have way
too many lies as it is

1253
01:15:41,700 --> 01:15:45,700
butter it's a ludicrous la K

1254
01:15:45,700 --> 01:15:48,889
it's a pretty ludicrous law because a

1255
01:15:48,890 --> 01:15:53,130
the radio spectrum is its it is radio
signals flown all around a passing

1256
01:15:53,130 --> 01:15:53,530
through

1257
01:15:53,530 --> 01:15:56,400
there that they're 100 to tell a
telephone calls floating right through

1258
01:15:56,400 --> 01:15:57,280
this room

1259
01:15:57,280 --> 01:16:00,980
do our bodies to our homes and if you
have a radio

1260
01:16:00,980 --> 01:16:04,070
that received a certain frequency range
and and

1261
01:16:04,070 --> 01:16:07,580
sale happens to be within the range that
can pick up then

1262
01:16:07,580 --> 01:16:11,070
you know why would why shouldn't be able
to take another study once when Cryptome

1263
01:16:11,070 --> 01:16:14,219
fine then you can make it hard to pick
up the your broadcast

1264
01:16:14,220 --> 01:16:18,310
in a clear and at the cellular telephone
lobby wanted just

1265
01:16:18,310 --> 01:16:22,590
make their customers feel that there's a
conversations were secured by getting by

1266
01:16:22,590 --> 01:16:23,600
paying off certains

1267
01:16:23,600 --> 01:16:26,930
I'm politicians to pass a law

1268
01:16:26,930 --> 01:16:30,430
that would make it illegal to do this
now it's very easy to do

1269
01:16:30,430 --> 01:16:33,670
so that doesn't stop anybody living if
anything I think this law is probably

1270
01:16:33,670 --> 01:16:36,430
made more people it is a lie cause its
find out what other

1271
01:16:36,430 --> 01:16:39,830
all the year controversies about yeah
its

1272
01:16:39,830 --> 01:16:42,900
common hobby a prior to that law

1273
01:16:42,900 --> 01:16:46,980
on ever since 1934 his being completely
legal

1274
01:16:46,980 --> 01:16:50,510
to listen to any radio frequency that
was one of the few a

1275
01:16:50,510 --> 01:16:53,750
one of the laws that the american
citizens one other regulations American

1276
01:16:53,750 --> 01:16:54,040
said

1277
01:16:54,040 --> 01:16:57,750
medicines enjoyed the radio spectrum
which was free and open anyone to listen

1278
01:16:57,750 --> 01:16:59,300
any signal e1 chill

1279
01:16:59,300 --> 01:17:03,410
on but now they started censoring the
radio spectrum and is now illegal

1280
01:17:03,410 --> 01:17:07,180
to listen to sail telephone
conversations is not illegal to its

1281
01:17:07,180 --> 01:17:11,060
listen to it cordless telephone
conversations those in the air

1282
01:17:11,060 --> 01:17:15,560
forty six to forty I by from the base
stations 46 47 megahertz

1283
01:17:15,560 --> 01:17:19,390
their completely be able to listen to I
don't see any distinction I think they

1284
01:17:19,390 --> 01:17:20,990
should both be legal to listen to

1285
01:17:20,990 --> 01:17:25,030
so this is what a is the control channel
that we listen to before

1286
01:17:25,030 --> 01:17:28,190
and then you'll hear maybe some
interference after that

1287
01:17:28,190 --> 01:17:35,190
do

1288
01:17:49,190 --> 01:17:50,660
in

1289
01:17:50,660 --> 01:17:51,989
in I

1290
01:17:51,989 --> 01:17:58,220
yeah I don't think it's that big of a
deal

1291
01:17:58,220 --> 01:17:59,810
yeah

1292
01:17:59,810 --> 01:18:04,000
yeah I hidden

1293
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:07,880
thanks for calling

1294
01:18:07,880 --> 01:18:12,950
yes and I don't think alike lol you come
online yeah

1295
01:18:12,950 --> 01:18:16,210
now this shirt this particular
interference was a

1296
01:18:16,210 --> 01:18:20,490
it was does Dre

1297
01:18:20,490 --> 01:18:25,860
its there's probably was probably
originating from

1298
01:18:25,860 --> 01:18:30,410
or are Coogee I R this is probably other
side of the

1299
01:18:30,410 --> 01:18:33,420
a profound comp sale the phone
conversation whereby the person with the

1300
01:18:33,420 --> 01:18:34,300
sailor found

1301
01:18:34,300 --> 01:18:38,200
had a hands-free phone I found at the
hands free speaker fans often a

1302
01:18:38,200 --> 01:18:41,769
only a light intercept on the

1303
01:18:41,770 --> 01:18:45,230
the other end the conversation on phones
without

1304
01:18:45,230 --> 01:18:49,760
with that speaker fashion

1305
01:18:49,760 --> 01:18:53,150
you can often hear both Poseidon I here
some other nefarious me this the

1306
01:18:53,150 --> 01:18:54,060
different kind

1307
01:18:54,060 --> 01:18:59,510
hey said it's okay

1308
01:18:59,510 --> 01:19:04,110
thin

1309
01:19:04,110 --> 01:19:08,240
there now if you heard that that buzzing
noise that was the

1310
01:19:08,240 --> 01:19:12,210
cont'd a sailor system telling that
particular found

1311
01:19:12,210 --> 01:19:15,190
to change frequencies and the reading it
all that on a change repins he's

1312
01:19:15,190 --> 01:19:17,810
probably is that person was driving a
traveling in a car

1313
01:19:17,810 --> 01:19:20,940
and at getting out a range between one
cell site which

1314
01:19:20,940 --> 01:19:25,500
cell sites maybe just a few I a my in
less than a mile in diameter to several

1315
01:19:25,500 --> 01:19:26,840
miles in diameter depending on

1316
01:19:26,840 --> 01:19:29,840
how populated area itself on

1317
01:19:29,840 --> 01:19:34,280
that buzzing noise was digital data
being centered about ten thousand barges

1318
01:19:34,280 --> 01:19:35,240
sailor found

1319
01:19:35,240 --> 01:19:38,550
ships a computer in the secular phone
saying switch to this other channel and

1320
01:19:38,550 --> 01:19:38,840
then

1321
01:19:38,840 --> 01:19:42,290
if you're driving around a sale thanks
some time to hear drop Africa have a

1322
01:19:42,290 --> 01:19:45,210
second reporter second that's what
happened you shifted frequencies

1323
01:19:45,210 --> 01:19:50,270
now someone listening to sail a phone
calls that's annoying because

1324
01:19:50,270 --> 01:19:53,640
it's like all the sudden where they go
and you might be less than one

1325
01:19:53,640 --> 01:19:56,719
conversation another 10 this or to pop
up in the same frequency wonder what why

1326
01:19:56,719 --> 01:19:57,890
and that's what's happening

1327
01:19:57,890 --> 01:20:01,500
on there is equipment software on the
market that tony was putting up with me

1328
01:20:01,500 --> 01:20:02,140
and bring

1329
01:20:02,140 --> 01:20:05,940
summer that stop it LinkedIn com that
that actually

1330
01:20:05,940 --> 01:20:10,200
I'm sorry okay on side someone will be
putting its offer on that

1331
01:20:10,200 --> 01:20:13,929
on the net that allows you with with the
right hardware to

1332
01:20:13,930 --> 01:20:17,420
attract these calls and this is exactly
what was done with the

1333
01:20:17,420 --> 01:20:21,850
the OJ Simpson surveillance on not only
can car calls very easily

1334
01:20:21,850 --> 01:20:25,320
intercepted but the location of the
sailor found

1335
01:20:25,320 --> 01:20:28,500
can be very easily determined by the
cellular carriers well as in the OJ

1336
01:20:28,500 --> 01:20:29,200
Simpson

1337
01:20:29,200 --> 01:20:33,519
situation and all the way to do that is
their computer station of oversimplified

1338
01:20:33,520 --> 01:20:34,030
is better

1339
01:20:34,030 --> 01:20:37,110
computer system knows which cell site

1340
01:20:37,110 --> 01:20:40,210
you're communicating through based on
the channel the iran in

1341
01:20:40,210 --> 01:20:44,230
this is Michelle twinge Intel sign after
look on a map salmon computer thing to

1342
01:20:44,230 --> 01:20:45,690
say okay in this cell site

1343
01:20:45,690 --> 01:20:49,370
now in this our site now initial site
and if it's going in this direction as

1344
01:20:49,370 --> 01:20:50,510
for the major through for

1345
01:20:50,510 --> 01:20:53,530
is to that area they can tell roughly
where you are they can't pinpoint you

1346
01:20:53,530 --> 01:20:54,019
down to

1347
01:20:54,020 --> 01:20:57,840
you know if you feed but said and
measures this isn't a more sophisticated

1348
01:20:57,840 --> 01:21:00,190
they'll be able to tell you why are
probably within

1349
01:21:00,190 --> 01:21:04,760
a few hundred feet on there's new
technology out there called a GPS Global

1350
01:21:04,760 --> 01:21:06,510
Positioning System in venturi one

1351
01:21:06,510 --> 01:21:09,810
sailor fans have that built into them as
a standard feature they could probably

1352
01:21:09,810 --> 01:21:10,510
tell our

1353
01:21:10,510 --> 01:21:14,860
tell you where you are within 10 to 15
feet now undertake searching questions

1354
01:21:14,860 --> 01:21:21,650
yeah

1355
01:21:21,650 --> 01:21:28,650
be mmm rain mmm

1356
01:21:33,140 --> 01:21:36,960
night they could triangulate on what's
what he saying basically is a

1357
01:21:36,960 --> 01:21:40,090
they could tell this solar system to
tell your found

1358
01:21:40,090 --> 01:21:44,040
to switch to this channel in one cell
site and switch another channel in a

1359
01:21:44,040 --> 01:21:45,100
nearby cell site

1360
01:21:45,100 --> 01:21:48,540
Nick measures into cellular systems
constantly monitoring the signal

1361
01:21:48,540 --> 01:21:51,050
strength in your found for legitimate
reasons so we can know

1362
01:21:51,050 --> 01:21:53,930
how to adjust the power leveling your
phone and what are the head of an excel

1363
01:21:53,930 --> 01:21:54,290
in a

1364
01:21:54,290 --> 01:21:57,620
they compare the signal levels from the
from the surrounding cells

1365
01:21:57,620 --> 01:22:00,990
are coming from your from your found and

1366
01:22:00,990 --> 01:22:05,250
you know triangulate but more precisely
is where you located

1367
01:22:05,250 --> 01:22:10,530
your I'm

1368
01:22:10,530 --> 01:22:14,200
yes I my guess is that they don't do
this on a regular basis for this its

1369
01:22:14,200 --> 01:22:19,380
its it involves time and effort on and
you would hear

1370
01:22:19,380 --> 01:22:22,650
you would hear the dropout briefly on
but

1371
01:22:22,650 --> 01:22:25,590
he could be cause for other reasons I
mean at if you're right between the

1372
01:22:25,590 --> 01:22:27,010
borders leading to cell sites

1373
01:22:27,010 --> 01:22:31,280
oftentimes it'll be still switch back
and forth kinda Nadal and now against

1374
01:22:31,280 --> 01:22:31,599
you

1375
01:22:31,600 --> 01:22:35,300
on FM radio for driving between two
cities and you and is one station the

1376
01:22:35,300 --> 01:22:37,630
other city in the same frequencies a
station the city left

1377
01:22:37,630 --> 01:22:41,300
you'd like both stations like 10 coming
I'll pop in and goes back and forth

1378
01:22:41,300 --> 01:22:45,570
they'll happily psycho sometimes so what
it would necessarily mean you're under

1379
01:22:45,570 --> 01:22:46,210
surveillance

1380
01:22:46,210 --> 01:22:49,480
I

1381
01:22:49,480 --> 01:22:53,140
that's true or don't use one that has
been no has your a legitimate telephone

1382
01:22:53,140 --> 01:22:57,790
number is your number stored in it
that's

1383
01:22:57,790 --> 01:23:03,060
yes that's that's icky a key point on
your phone does not have to be used

1384
01:23:03,060 --> 01:23:06,220
be in use for the sale the company to
know where you are

1385
01:23:06,220 --> 01:23:10,220
on if if the phone is just on

1386
01:23:10,220 --> 01:23:14,550
she turned her phone on its end its its
information to the sell your system

1387
01:23:14,550 --> 01:23:17,840
on and the system can poll you

1388
01:23:17,840 --> 01:23:21,710
this sale operator can jail is just my
pretty can pull your found find out

1389
01:23:21,710 --> 01:23:24,900
what to where you are just or

1390
01:23:24,900 --> 01:23:29,390
whether your phone is on in with your in
it in the area just by doing a quick a

1391
01:23:29,390 --> 01:23:36,390
a poll to that frequency me

1392
01:23:39,550 --> 01:23:46,550
yeah a lot of up

1393
01:23:49,620 --> 01:23:53,260
yeah dispersed disaster some say love
and have provisioned for having more

1394
01:23:53,260 --> 01:23:54,820
than one phone number in them

1395
01:23:54,820 --> 01:23:59,080
on the reason you would want to do that
is if you travel between two cities very

1396
01:23:59,080 --> 01:23:59,890
frequently

1397
01:23:59,890 --> 01:24:04,580
you wanted a save money on the roaming
fees from the secretary is a really high

1398
01:24:04,580 --> 01:24:05,380
like a

1399
01:24:05,380 --> 01:24:09,440
you can be as much as the three dollars
a minute if you're out from another city

1400
01:24:09,440 --> 01:24:10,190
you're using another

1401
01:24:10,190 --> 01:24:13,950
it a different city said system they
really rape ya ni se

1402
01:24:13,950 --> 01:24:17,139
these these roaming charges it sometimes
cheaper too

1403
01:24:17,140 --> 01:24:20,660
get service in another city sign to the
same serial number but you'd be

1404
01:24:20,660 --> 01:24:21,639
different phone number

1405
01:24:21,640 --> 01:24:25,810
and essentially ve ever found has
several phone number capability you can

1406
01:24:25,810 --> 01:24:29,550
you legitimately had her phone number in
different cities butter he was asking

1407
01:24:29,550 --> 01:24:31,070
how did you pay do this with us offer

1408
01:24:31,070 --> 01:24:34,639
we still have to change this year old
number individually each time you want

1409
01:24:34,640 --> 01:24:35,400
to change

1410
01:24:35,400 --> 01:24:38,610
on illegitimately change

1411
01:24:38,610 --> 01:24:42,150
phone numbers if you have a legitimate
phone number and other city

1412
01:24:42,150 --> 01:24:46,450
I'm you would have to change yes ends
but on you don't you can only do one at

1413
01:24:46,450 --> 01:24:46,960
a time

1414
01:24:46,960 --> 01:24:52,260
some fans have the ability to

1415
01:24:52,260 --> 01:24:56,350
be activated with out raining

1416
01:24:56,350 --> 01:25:00,140
on not all phones are like that but
that's particularly scary big brother

1417
01:25:00,140 --> 01:25:01,560
type thing you could be striving

1418
01:25:01,560 --> 01:25:04,470
driving along they could hear what
you're saying gee the piercing a car

1419
01:25:04,470 --> 01:25:05,940
listen to what what's the

1420
01:25:05,940 --> 01:25:09,990
you're listening to on your car radio I
have accidentally intercepted sale

1421
01:25:09,990 --> 01:25:10,980
telephone calls

1422
01:25:10,980 --> 01:25:14,530
where I I could hear somebody on hold

1423
01:25:14,530 --> 01:25:17,630
and I could hear them having a
conversation with the other person the

1424
01:25:17,630 --> 01:25:20,580
card is a microphone in the fans pretty
sensitive in a lot of these fans are

1425
01:25:20,580 --> 01:25:24,019
hands-free their microphone up in the
diet the visor now for some really

1426
01:25:24,020 --> 01:25:24,660
interesting

1427
01:25:24,660 --> 01:25:28,170
by accident of course the really
interesting conversations its people

1428
01:25:28,170 --> 01:25:31,920
in the cars talking to each other on
arguments whatever

1429
01:25:31,920 --> 01:25:38,920
me

1430
01:25:44,350 --> 01:25:51,350
law

1431
01:25:52,159 --> 01:25:55,099
yeah that's that's one another
application for surveillance for sale

1432
01:25:55,099 --> 01:25:55,619
event

1433
01:25:55,619 --> 01:25:58,789
I could I could call a make a phone call
on

1434
01:25:58,789 --> 01:26:02,820
on a portable phone like this and just
leave it on in

1435
01:26:02,820 --> 01:26:06,199
and to hide under the table here and
then go home

1436
01:26:06,199 --> 01:26:09,420
and anything being said in this room is
within your shower the microphone will

1437
01:26:09,420 --> 01:26:10,900
be transmitted to my home

1438
01:26:10,900 --> 01:26:14,300
I system now would be very expensive to
do that

1439
01:26:14,300 --> 01:26:18,340
on because I ran our players to the
battery ran off right but if you had a

1440
01:26:18,340 --> 01:26:20,170
plug in AC could run even longer

1441
01:26:20,170 --> 01:26:23,170
but I've heard that law enforcement
agencies have have

1442
01:26:23,170 --> 01:26:28,150
equipment is available to them to allow
a cellular telephone to be attached to

1443
01:26:28,150 --> 01:26:31,489
you know the other side of the vehicle
on with the microphone cable being run

1444
01:26:31,489 --> 01:26:32,659
to the inside the vehicle

1445
01:26:32,659 --> 01:26:36,409
and they can just call a modified
Taliban they just call this thing

1446
01:26:36,409 --> 01:26:40,860
and listen to what's going on your car
now legally a person having an award to

1447
01:26:40,860 --> 01:26:41,848
do that but to

1448
01:26:41,849 --> 01:26:45,659
frankly the number warrant issued for
this kinda stuff extremely low number

1449
01:26:45,659 --> 01:26:49,099
on last year I think there are only
about 140 legal

1450
01:26:49,099 --> 01:26:52,989
wiretaps now their phone wire taps but I
think either type 2 surveillance

1451
01:26:52,989 --> 01:26:56,170
is less common as far as far as well
legal

1452
01:26:56,170 --> 01:26:59,829
warranted electronic surveillance is
most often done

1453
01:26:59,829 --> 01:27:02,938
the a telephone on like monitoring

1454
01:27:02,939 --> 01:27:06,309
the it this way the legal warrant issued
for that sort of thing

1455
01:27:06,309 --> 01:27:10,349
it's very small number yet the equipment
sold to be able to do this to law

1456
01:27:10,349 --> 01:27:11,340
enforcing agencies

1457
01:27:11,340 --> 01:27:15,239
is in a million two dollars a year the
numbers don't add up with all these

1458
01:27:15,239 --> 01:27:17,420
things called the surveillance was being
done legally

1459
01:27:17,420 --> 01:27:20,939
there be no very small market this
equipment up million dollars where the

1460
01:27:20,939 --> 01:27:22,119
discoms being sold

1461
01:27:22,119 --> 01:27:26,070
too long fortune ag's every year and he
buy new stuff so reason it on somebody

1462
01:27:26,070 --> 01:27:26,989
and its

1463
01:27:26,989 --> 01:27:31,570
anybody's guess as to who I'm

1464
01:27:31,570 --> 01:27:37,478
I yet to come over to the table all

1465
01:27:37,479 --> 01:27:41,469
argument modified electronics your
numbers over other that the insecure

1466
01:27:41,469 --> 01:27:41,920
found

1467
01:27:41,920 --> 01:27:45,380
no I don't know which ones I had that
ability maybe you know what

1468
01:27:45,380 --> 01:27:48,920
which fans can beach can be activated
without ringing on C can hear the audio

1469
01:27:48,920 --> 01:27:49,519
from them

1470
01:27:49,519 --> 01:27:55,979
the microphone okay well

1471
01:27:55,979 --> 01:27:59,400
the GSM lead nazism

1472
01:27:59,400 --> 01:28:03,010
you which system well the old the older
analogues

1473
01:28:03,010 --> 01:28:06,119
with us at the analog system in a in
Europe I

1474
01:28:06,119 --> 01:28:09,739
might be more successful economic thing
but I for that there are some found on

1475
01:28:09,739 --> 01:28:11,639
the american am system they have the
capability

1476
01:28:11,639 --> 01:28:17,239
I don't know which one the I'm sorry mmm

1477
01:28:17,239 --> 01:28:21,110
the one

1478
01:28:21,110 --> 01:28:26,039
well-used

1479
01:28:26,039 --> 01:28:29,978
the the discussion was a BF two founders
the climb with the same phone number

1480
01:28:29,979 --> 01:28:33,989
legitimately allegedly I and one and
some because they found that phone

1481
01:28:33,989 --> 01:28:36,050
number what happened with my phone rings
well

1482
01:28:36,050 --> 01:28:39,400
before that Sandra before the phone
would ring you're gonna have a system

1483
01:28:39,400 --> 01:28:40,380
conflict because

1484
01:28:40,380 --> 01:28:43,939
this isn't gonna see one found here
another found there you don't know which

1485
01:28:43,939 --> 01:28:45,539
found to send the signal still

1486
01:28:45,539 --> 01:28:49,130
show what channel whatever both phones
if they're both the same cell se can be

1487
01:28:49,130 --> 01:28:51,849
working the same frequency cuz the
system can handle that so

1488
01:28:51,849 --> 01:28:56,510
on odds are I tried that and in some
systems the software

1489
01:28:56,510 --> 01:29:00,159
will ring both phones but only one will
pass audio in other areas neither will

1490
01:29:00,159 --> 01:29:00,679
bring

1491
01:29:00,679 --> 01:29:04,280
on and other heirs only one working at
all my work at all so it really depends

1492
01:29:04,280 --> 01:29:05,619
on the system software

1493
01:29:05,619 --> 01:29:11,459
and what hardware the using it on a the
particular network its last minute

1494
01:29:11,459 --> 01:29:12,909
really register sell for the system

1495
01:29:12,909 --> 01:29:16,959
that's okay there's an answer your
question I'm sorry

1496
01:29:16,959 --> 01:29:22,010
are you had about you have had that you
have you had the audio worked for both

1497
01:29:22,010 --> 01:29:22,570
of them

1498
01:29:22,570 --> 01:29:26,219
okay I i havent actual experience that
i've

1499
01:29:26,219 --> 01:29:29,559
I've been able to get both in the rain
but only one up in the past the audience

1500
01:29:29,559 --> 01:29:29,880
now

1501
01:29:29,880 --> 01:29:33,570
configure I i imagine there some
citizens were that would work

1502
01:29:33,570 --> 01:29:36,749
they don't have the the newer software
installed in a in a sailor system

1503
01:29:36,749 --> 01:29:43,749
on the other

1504
01:29:45,300 --> 01:29:48,929
I would say that it's very easily easy
to intercept it is easy intercept

1505
01:29:48,929 --> 01:29:52,889
data transmissions there be sent over so
their modem is it is to work pick up

1506
01:29:52,889 --> 01:29:53,780
boys you have to

1507
01:29:53,780 --> 01:29:57,579
we have to hook up a modem or some sorta
modulated your receiver but today yet I

1508
01:29:57,579 --> 01:29:58,749
would not be very secure

1509
01:29:58,749 --> 01:30:01,769
I engine encryption on

1510
01:30:01,769 --> 01:30:04,969
there are products on the market to
encrypt say I conversations in fact

1511
01:30:04,969 --> 01:30:06,249
yesterday talked about the clipper chip

1512
01:30:06,249 --> 01:30:10,079
ATT makes a a sailor found an ATT Taylor
found with the clipper chip

1513
01:30:10,079 --> 01:30:14,119
in it but I'm if you hurt my thing
clipper chip yesterday but I won't use

1514
01:30:14,119 --> 01:30:14,478
that

1515
01:30:14,479 --> 01:30:21,309
0

1516
01:30:21,309 --> 01:30:25,479
on okay I'll do that see it at a hearing
is probably

1517
01:30:25,479 --> 01:30:29,479
I'm probably way past my aunt allotted
time so we're give you a question about

1518
01:30:29,479 --> 01:30:30,619
this stuff I'll be at the

1519
01:30:30,619 --> 01:30:34,438
the table at the far end you're near the
windows demonstrating even you can play

1520
01:30:34,439 --> 01:30:36,249
with this receiver look at the phones

1521
01:30:36,249 --> 01:30:39,769
I you can try to find some interference
a sailor frequencies yourself if you'd

1522
01:30:39,769 --> 01:30:40,719
like to

1523
01:30:40,719 --> 01:30:44,630
and okay hotel also mark is gonna tell
us about the a

1524
01:30:44,630 --> 01:30:48,280
the young 900 we've been here forever I
know that twenty years a.m.

1525
01:30:48,280 --> 01:30:52,209
he gone alright will keep going where
the Energizer I'm

1526
01:30:52,209 --> 01:30:54,789
mark is developed some really
interesting software and hardware that

1527
01:30:54,789 --> 01:30:56,119
allow certain fans to

1528
01:30:56,119 --> 01:30:59,768
do a lot of amazing things that you
shouldn't be able to deal

1529
01:30:59,769 --> 01:31:06,769
but he's not talk about that now

1530
01:31:11,260 --> 01:31:13,020
the head

1531
01:31:13,020 --> 01:31:18,270
the

1532
01:31:18,270 --> 01:31:22,120
so little the

1533
01:31:22,120 --> 01:31:23,269
and

1534
01:31:23,270 --> 01:31:26,300
want this is a

1535
01:31:26,300 --> 01:31:31,100
do need I the lunar than 100

1536
01:31:31,100 --> 01:31:34,120
yeah he was a

1537
01:31:34,120 --> 01:31:38,230
a Kade the

1538
01:31:38,230 --> 01:31:43,400
I monitor the maze

1539
01:31:43,400 --> 01:31:48,429
yeah me he must they're not really

1540
01:31:48,429 --> 01:31:53,179
that has a that he was a

1541
01:31:53,179 --> 01:31:58,330
the love that he has only

1542
01:31:58,330 --> 01:32:05,330
the designs all is lost that he often
doesn't know the real the room

1543
01:32:07,349 --> 01:32:11,979
then you know this is a whole release

1544
01:32:11,979 --> 01:32:14,590
the

1545
01:32:14,590 --> 01:32:15,530
on

1546
01:32:15,530 --> 01:32:19,460
and I Turner a

1547
01:32:19,460 --> 01:32:24,739
this thirteen Israelis home this is
Alicia

1548
01:32:24,739 --> 01:32:28,949
car people who know then I'll

1549
01:32:28,949 --> 01:32:31,980
to handle all the

1550
01:32:31,980 --> 01:32:36,560
I a we're not we're doing what we do
know

1551
01:32:36,560 --> 01:32:40,600
and if you move ahead with homeless a

1552
01:32:40,600 --> 01:32:44,050
you know unit 1

1553
01:32:44,050 --> 01:32:45,559
the you may

1554
01:32:45,559 --> 01:32:50,129
didn't know the masala and he was like

1555
01:32:50,129 --> 01:32:53,400
then you know it was you know I

1556
01:32:53,400 --> 01:32:56,909
all it new home

1557
01:32:56,909 --> 01:33:00,330
the meeting room

1558
01:33:00,330 --> 01:33:06,330
to 1 I'm and is already a Yahoo

1559
01:33:06,330 --> 01:33:10,860
is up number and what is needed is

1560
01:33:10,860 --> 01:33:14,620
is ball rolling out in rat brain all who
doubt phone

1561
01:33:14,620 --> 01:33:18,580
and 10 northward is somewhere for a

1562
01:33:18,580 --> 01:33:21,670
for the 8051 processor which is

1563
01:33:21,670 --> 01:33:25,190
up pretty much for the use in the 900 is
a very into the

1564
01:33:25,190 --> 01:33:31,960
8051 to sense talking to and we also
have you noticed mats for the phone the

1565
01:33:31,960 --> 01:33:33,560
people merely technical manual

1566
01:33:33,560 --> 01:33:39,970
in Muse's madness to figure out what
what devices without the CPU

1567
01:33:39,970 --> 01:33:43,590
what what medications and addresses they
were matter

1568
01:33:43,590 --> 01:33:47,170
so we can understand what well prices
the probe was trying to access

1569
01:33:47,170 --> 01:33:50,780
I'll so it is not known

1570
01:33:50,780 --> 01:33:53,969
and Human Services all-time I you know
much

1571
01:33:53,970 --> 01:33:57,950
it just turns numbers and letters %uh
and

1572
01:33:57,950 --> 01:34:01,040
basing his government instructions to
install lovers

1573
01:34:01,040 --> 01:34:05,100
so what you have to do this is good and

1574
01:34:05,100 --> 01:34:08,110
is a single step through becoming yeah

1575
01:34:08,110 --> 01:34:11,570
to know what is trying to do windstar

1576
01:34:11,570 --> 01:34:16,630
many commentator giving some teams
months ago or so between us

1577
01:34:16,630 --> 01:34:19,970
and slowly so you can surf piece
together

1578
01:34:19,970 --> 01:34:23,350
what's going on in the fall community
has

1579
01:34:23,350 --> 01:34:27,170
I'll $140k mice with a permanent

1580
01:34:27,170 --> 01:34:32,190
so is it was a lot of time no about my
happiness

1581
01:34:32,190 --> 01:34:37,220
actually not home right is I'll test and
diagnostic machines that are built into

1582
01:34:37,220 --> 01:34:37,790
the phone

1583
01:34:37,790 --> 01:34:42,550
no about 100

1584
01:34:42,550 --> 01:34:46,120
I'm is actually the protocol processing
for

1585
01:34:46,120 --> 01:34:51,269
producing also your phone on her call
when I have it's just the user interface

1586
01:34:51,270 --> 01:34:54,700
done with all menus and things though he
has a lot of features

1587
01:34:54,700 --> 01:34:59,910
no some home so you know

1588
01:34:59,910 --> 01:35:03,750
a DB sweeney users Facebook

1589
01:35:03,750 --> 01:35:07,720
onto Interstate Muslims in the test and
diagnostics

1590
01:35:07,720 --> 01:35:12,160
part to the code and I'll with call and
we can stop

1591
01:35:12,160 --> 01:35:16,450
yeah I'm was really noticed on this
message was not

1592
01:35:16,450 --> 01:35:21,090
was a channel on the phone well if you
want to learn anything like that and

1593
01:35:21,090 --> 01:35:21,900
I'll

1594
01:35:21,900 --> 01:35:26,680
carton small business playing out more
jobs

1595
01:35:26,680 --> 01:35:29,930
most unusual janet is leader

1596
01:35:29,930 --> 01:35:34,040
for hooking up a cigarette lighter
adapter is the power or an excellent and

1597
01:35:34,040 --> 01:35:34,710
I'll

1598
01:35:34,710 --> 01:35:39,240
and an awesome thing diagnostics a
programmable I'm

1599
01:35:39,240 --> 01:35:42,510
so we went to his unfinished

1600
01:35:42,510 --> 01:35:49,510
and I'm ministrations Matt worries the
street outlines

1601
01:35:50,430 --> 01:35:54,040
go images when state in the processor
and then

1602
01:35:54,040 --> 01:35:58,490
I'm I have to use it both Roman
processor

1603
01:35:58,490 --> 01:36:02,150
up by nineteen access to resign opens on
the processor

1604
01:36:02,150 --> 01:36:07,030
and and try to disassemble months ago
they were not so

1605
01:36:07,030 --> 01:36:11,960
then promises don't watch what happens
when

1606
01:36:11,960 --> 01:36:16,570
finals turn on this and that up so

1607
01:36:16,570 --> 01:36:20,099
any reasonableness to talk on the phone

1608
01:36:20,100 --> 01:36:26,110
to try to start your homework and
getting her system was all the possible

1609
01:36:26,110 --> 01:36:30,070
so I need so handmade seems a little

1610
01:36:30,070 --> 01:36:34,030
when it's a good words that didn't make
contact with the Pens double-barrel

1611
01:36:34,030 --> 01:36:37,480
or a PC yeah those are experimenting
with a

1612
01:36:37,480 --> 01:36:40,590
and something you know who becomes the
United

1613
01:36:40,590 --> 01:36:43,750
like a plan we'll be seeing read the
code and and so we try to sell

1614
01:36:43,750 --> 01:36:47,830
I was working no matterhorn

1615

started to see you in tonight not too
close

1617
01:36:55,060 --> 01:36:58,760
and and send commands to T to do not a
diagnostic test

1618
01:36:58,760 --> 01:37:02,150
on those would be things like term
transmitter on all

1619
01:37:02,150 --> 01:37:07,580
up sensing ringtones Central St Lucie
control messages get

1620
01:37:07,580 --> 01:37:10,890
the signals to major the battery level
I'll

1621
01:37:10,890 --> 01:37:15,240
well also it's a normal up just wanted

1624
01:37:25,160 --> 01:37:29,769

1625
01:37:29,770 --> 01:37:33,130
see good you did senator really did you
know that owns

1626
01:37:33,130 --> 01:37:37,660
up most men also available for the G
word

1627
01:37:37,660 --> 01:37:41,360
in a special test mode you can enter you
can I do i turn the phone on

1628
01:37:41,360 --> 01:37:43,950
and put them in a certain key
combination it you can get it that's not

1629
01:37:43,950 --> 01:37:45,130
an excuse to my aunt

1630

talk on the phone messages commanders no

1632
01:37:51,950 --> 01:37:55,410
so

1633
01:37:55,410 --> 01:38:00,920
up apparent as an alternate love you
baby

1634
01:38:00,920 --> 01:38:04,820
more problems up and what's the news

1635
01:38:04,820 --> 01:38:09,500
News BBC news and news release but
anything like to see you this

1636
01:38:09,500 --> 01:38:13,800
issues in the 900 and over 800 cities
homes

1637
01:38:13,800 --> 01:38:19,140
and then there is the lot 50 which is a
member on this list is the processor

1638
01:38:19,140 --> 01:38:23,860
column in The Sims expires Oct 22 Sun I
G is a

1639
01:38:23,860 --> 01:38:28,290
pretty person's job but its its neighbor
has a leader's instructions. a

1640
01:38:28,290 --> 01:38:32,420
no and it was kinda base in Asia 8051
but

1641
01:38:32,420 --> 01:38:37,850
it's not compatible all so rising only
51 is there a lot of tools available

1642
01:38:37,850 --> 01:38:42,000
already available was its maiden 8051
sumitomo's any company that makes chips

1643
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:45,990
no some rust free someone's into
someone's and such

1644
01:38:45,990 --> 01:38:50,240
and that there was nothing to the 150
for that nature are no

1645
01:38:50,240 --> 01:38:53,830
so it happened here this is this which
is new processor

1646
01:38:53,830 --> 01:38:57,380
and also another in the 1200 series car
phones which which only use this new

1647
01:38:57,380 --> 01:38:58,050
processor

1648
01:38:58,050 --> 01:39:01,570
no and when

1649
01:39:01,570 --> 01:39:04,790
well as it was on the phone

1650
01:39:04,790 --> 01:39:07,850
no the 900 is a

1651
01:39:07,850 --> 01:39:12,790
but when isn't my dolls like wrong but
in a in SOIC package the strange

1652
01:39:12,790 --> 01:39:16,860
package I'm the night I was a really
nice

1653
01:39:16,860 --> 01:39:20,230
if you wanna if you wanna play in the
the phone because energy

1654
01:39:20,230 --> 01:39:23,380
and using rule did such a deep run for
the code

1655
01:39:23,380 --> 01:39:28,460
so one thing I did when I do not own a
testing was like my only problem you

1656
01:39:28,460 --> 01:39:28,920
later

1657
01:39:28,920 --> 01:39:32,770
into the car phones michael has some
water and on the phone a few seconds and

1658
01:39:32,770 --> 01:39:34,060
try things out

1659
01:39:34,060 --> 01:39:38,870
wouldn't be submitted routine and put it
on the other phones is that the code

1660
01:39:38,870 --> 01:39:39,630
between all

1661
01:39:39,630 --> 01:39:44,570
different phones as principal the

1662
01:39:44,570 --> 01:39:48,710
the news that he decided he loves any
revisions and

1663
01:39:48,710 --> 01:39:52,020
rapidly through the mcclatchy this
mission started

1664
01:39:52,020 --> 01:39:55,710
sign them on and I was told it was
really because I love all

1665
01:39:55,710 --> 01:39:58,920
rival problems with the sockets SOIC
sockets are

1666
01:39:58,920 --> 01:40:02,500
are pretty cool G I'll

1667
01:40:02,500 --> 01:40:06,190
the emails were almost also know mean

1668
01:40:06,190 --> 01:40:10,160
in the one who owns with the 8051 it was
just a standard

1669
01:40:10,160 --> 01:40:13,290
28 c64 ernest was not package

1670
01:40:13,290 --> 01:40:18,060
I'm not alone to see you should I G has
told him I said the problem

1671
01:40:18,060 --> 01:40:21,780
built into the CPU only so there's no
way to access

1672
01:40:21,780 --> 01:40:26,480
the he promised only you know you no
longer want to see you will be hearing

1673
01:40:26,480 --> 01:40:27,790
from former

1674
01:40:27,790 --> 01:40:32,240
because it is he was the only thing that
can actually talk to

1675
01:40:32,240 --> 01:40:35,929
many have gone either there's no
internet access to the memory

1676
01:40:35,930 --> 01:40:39,440
just see %um C has commended

1677
01:40:39,440 --> 01:40:43,100
passes the problem no and

1678
01:40:43,100 --> 01:40:47,110
so they actually had a really good she
doesn't universe is your phone

1679
01:40:47,110 --> 01:40:51,710

01:40:52,780 --> 01:40:55,780
no you need to know this is not your
phone

1682
01:40:55,780 --> 01:41:00,480
the 900 West it's just a little to go in
like five things like the ESN

1683
01:41:00,480 --> 01:41:05,010
was on the 908 they only last double
check out of work

1684
01:41:05,010 --> 01:41:08,650

1685
01:41:08,650 --> 01:41:15,650
stuff no

1686
01:41:21,150 --> 01:41:25,849
that's another time do you know major

up and those bosnia passengers

1690
01:41:37,800 --> 01:41:41,659
up nobody was hurt us is it last

1691
01:41:41,659 --> 01:41:45,920
it less opportunity was eating such as
the phone

1692
01:41:45,920 --> 01:41:49,900
well access the internet without being
too friendly with each other so

1693
01:41:49,900 --> 01:41:54,829
the post anything will happen because
the muslims in all

1694
01:41:54,829 --> 01:41:58,259
when you don't %uh doesn't get admitted
it was his action
