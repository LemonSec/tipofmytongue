1
00:00:08,779 --> 00:00:15,779
economic growth

2
00:00:17,150 --> 00:00:22,000
cut staff and actually along the way it
often in the late nineteen sixties uh...

3
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,959
i was a volunteer to radio station
called the b_b_a_ i which uh...

4
00:00:25,959 --> 00:00:28,019
i believe is still in existence

5
00:00:28,019 --> 00:00:32,250
and they sent me on a uh... i was about
maybe sixteen or seventeen years old

6
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:35,650
they sent me on a field assignment to do
a report on something called phone

7
00:00:35,650 --> 00:00:38,530
freaks which occurred in the basement of
some hotel

8
00:00:38,530 --> 00:00:40,920
poetry second where but the

9
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:44,150
on the big attraction was abbie hoffman
showed up

10
00:00:44,150 --> 00:00:45,339
and uh...

11
00:00:45,340 --> 00:00:49,220
uh... they had a very nice convention
they were up a lot of uh... uh...

12
00:00:49,220 --> 00:00:52,820
secret service type people hanging
around at night i people hang around it

13
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:55,580
maybe that forty fifty people

14
00:00:55,580 --> 00:00:59,699
and uh... sort of fade out fade in
nineteen seventy three i went to n_y_u_

15
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:01,310
film school

16
00:01:01,310 --> 00:01:04,090
and i had to do a document reform
project

17
00:01:04,090 --> 00:01:07,700
and now we're trying to give a subject
me and my partner mark and wrote

18
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:10,740
we're going to do a film on scientology
and now we decided that was going to be

19
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:13,050
a little too dangerous at that point in
time so

20
00:01:13,050 --> 00:01:17,080
we decided that uh... phone freaking of
telephone freaking was it was pretty

21
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:21,009
innocuous owing me this film called ma
bell's delinquent children

22
00:01:21,009 --> 00:01:24,770
and uh... it one contact eachother
lauren and uh...

23
00:01:24,770 --> 00:01:28,610
uh... several other words uh... movies
on a shoestring and things like that may

24
00:01:28,610 --> 00:01:32,080
help highest we shouldn't be shown
museum of modern art makes a couple

25
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:33,929
thousand people stroll total

26
00:01:33,930 --> 00:01:38,230
uh... it was sort of lost uh... or
sitting in the costliest battle but

27
00:01:38,230 --> 00:01:41,610
and uh... i found out about this
conference last week

28
00:01:41,610 --> 00:01:45,060
and uh... i'd mention that i had this
film in the person dave who's your

29
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:48,920
somewhere i have it you know you know
you should show it all i think arguably

30
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:51,740
this is the oldest film about telephone
freaking

31
00:01:51,740 --> 00:01:55,259
and um... it's i think that we have
balanced it shows a political point of

32
00:01:55,259 --> 00:01:59,130
view business people as well as the
position of a_t_t_ versace's before the

33
00:01:59,130 --> 00:02:00,130
break up

34
00:02:00,130 --> 00:02:03,189
uh... so we'll be showing it ah... i
guess it two thirty in the other room

35
00:02:03,189 --> 00:02:04,620
which is uh...

36
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:11,620
condemning them all the way in the back
in

37
00:02:28,029 --> 00:02:35,029
but here it had every bit of information
stored on you in a single card

38
00:02:40,529 --> 00:02:43,439
and ask the person is going to get it
for you

39
00:02:43,439 --> 00:02:48,668
for any at ul contest in fact uh... if
for some of you have some clever sayings

40
00:02:48,669 --> 00:02:50,019
uh... for

41
00:02:50,019 --> 00:02:53,509
things that have not yet been invented
that comes with a credit for

42
00:02:53,509 --> 00:02:57,319
uh... positive or negative because uh...
as we all know technology can bring us a

43
00:02:57,319 --> 00:02:58,959
negative things as well

44
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:00,659
costly submit them

45
00:03:00,659 --> 00:03:03,519
little box out by the registration area

46
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:06,919
and will be given way some may zing
prizes on sunday

47
00:03:06,919 --> 00:03:11,059
for the uh... for the funniest ones and
i will be judging that right here

48
00:03:11,059 --> 00:03:13,259
so if you have a look like they're
saying of a

49
00:03:13,259 --> 00:03:15,869
now you will still be in

50
00:03:15,869 --> 00:03:18,909
uh... the other thing we've got going is
um...

51
00:03:18,909 --> 00:03:22,439
a postcard campaign for fiberoptic is
currently in prison

52
00:03:22,439 --> 00:03:26,129
i'm pennsylvania will have to post cards
lying around it and my message to women

53
00:03:26,129 --> 00:03:27,649
will mail out to him

54
00:03:27,649 --> 00:03:30,909
at the end the conference

55
00:03:30,909 --> 00:03:33,138
okay we have articles on

56
00:03:33,139 --> 00:03:35,170
cement truck are they were passing
around

57
00:03:35,170 --> 00:03:37,709
we also have a few technical

58
00:03:37,709 --> 00:03:39,939
books up here we only have four of them

59
00:03:39,939 --> 00:03:41,228
on so if

60
00:03:41,229 --> 00:03:44,729
people want to look at them whereas if
you've got to pass around share them

61
00:03:44,729 --> 00:03:46,680
are what we have

62
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:50,339
we have some information on this
semester card system

63
00:03:50,339 --> 00:03:52,519
which has been no introduced a new york
city

64
00:03:52,519 --> 00:03:55,009
over the past couple of months

65
00:03:55,009 --> 00:03:56,890
basically walk up to a machine

66
00:03:56,890 --> 00:03:58,809
and these are the same through

67
00:03:58,809 --> 00:04:00,840
and at the ducks the amount of um...

68
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:03,959
of money from the card when you when you
use it

69
00:04:03,959 --> 00:04:06,689
uh... it's insane system because it's
based

70
00:04:06,689 --> 00:04:09,589
on the lot of computers network together

71
00:04:09,589 --> 00:04:12,299
and we all know what can happen when you
do something like that

72
00:04:12,299 --> 00:04:18,608
uh... there are possibly uh... entry
points in many different areas

73
00:04:18,608 --> 00:04:21,519
we're trying to find out exactly what is
on these trips now

74
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:24,900
we tried a couple of weird experiments
we try to racing this trip

75
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:27,840
to see what happens here without the
machine

76
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:28,979
and know what happened

77
00:04:28,979 --> 00:04:32,248
absolutely nothing had no effect
whatsoever

78
00:04:32,249 --> 00:04:35,080
we're starting to wonder whether or not
this is actually a magnetic strip in

79
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:38,529
whether it might not be a barcode hidden
underneath what looks like a magnetic

80
00:04:38,529 --> 00:04:39,659
strip

81
00:04:39,659 --> 00:04:40,639
um...

82
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:44,870
all the intelligence we believe is
inside the computer not the card the

83
00:04:44,870 --> 00:04:46,169
card carries

84
00:04:46,169 --> 00:04:47,960
a serial number

85
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:53,289
and a bachelor amber an expiration date
which is pre printed on the back

86
00:04:53,289 --> 00:04:55,719
it's quite possible that is the only
information

87
00:04:55,719 --> 00:04:57,619
in the strip or the barcode

88
00:04:57,619 --> 00:04:59,879
and that when you swipe the card through

89
00:04:59,879 --> 00:05:03,849
rather than our writing information to
the car to simply accessing a local

90
00:05:03,849 --> 00:05:05,919
computer and telling

91
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:08,789
telling the um... the display how much
is actually

92
00:05:08,790 --> 00:05:12,309
credited to that particular accounts

93
00:05:12,309 --> 00:05:15,909
qatar hands-on employees card

94
00:05:15,909 --> 00:05:19,389
if

95
00:05:19,389 --> 00:05:21,930
this is not free access but

96
00:05:21,930 --> 00:05:26,850
mister free access on a really know the
by the

97
00:05:26,850 --> 00:05:30,819
test purposes only

98
00:05:30,819 --> 00:05:33,190
basically ah... this one is expired

99
00:05:33,190 --> 00:05:34,840
so we were able to use at all

100
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:36,669
program we selected through

101
00:05:36,669 --> 00:05:40,198
uh... it said this car has expired at
all this debate in time of the last

102
00:05:40,199 --> 00:05:42,150
uh... use of the card

103
00:05:42,150 --> 00:05:45,400
now it's going to stay now we have a
system like this by the way tokens will

104
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:47,969
be abolished in nineteen ninety seven in
the city

105
00:05:47,969 --> 00:05:51,180
uh... the system is currently in effect
in six to nine stations

106
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:54,509
and i think we have something like what
five hundred stations in the city

107
00:05:54,509 --> 00:05:55,520
uh... so

108
00:05:55,520 --> 00:06:00,020
by a nineteen ninety-seven every single
turnstile will be using the system

109
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:02,889
it's possible this could be used to
uh... to

110
00:06:02,889 --> 00:06:06,259
find out where you entered the subway
and when

111
00:06:06,259 --> 00:06:10,129
uh... of course doesn't have your name
on it but uh...

112
00:06:10,129 --> 00:06:12,709
if you say you in a certain time certain
place

113
00:06:12,709 --> 00:06:15,330
there'd be a way to verify it there
would be a way to track people

114
00:06:15,330 --> 00:06:17,340
it's it's one step closer

115
00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:21,089
uh... so there are dangers their
inherent in the system as well

116
00:06:21,089 --> 00:06:24,799
uh... we're open to any kind of
experimentation that we can do in the

117
00:06:24,799 --> 00:06:28,439
next three days here at this conference
we'd love to duplicate one of these

118
00:06:28,439 --> 00:06:31,669
things we'd love to see what happens in
that regard station right across the

119
00:06:31,669 --> 00:06:32,680
street

120
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:34,449
israel to duplicate one

121
00:06:34,449 --> 00:06:37,229
and slide it through the same time as
another one

122
00:06:37,229 --> 00:06:40,818
uh... we want to see what the reaction
is i want everybody in cities now

123
00:06:40,819 --> 00:06:45,050
process uh... it's kind of over here for
today

124
00:06:45,050 --> 00:06:47,680
we have uh... a special guest

125
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:49,829
well answer questions

126
00:06:49,829 --> 00:06:51,189
and a special guest

127
00:06:51,189 --> 00:06:53,360
happens to work

128
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:57,619
the transit authority he programs these
things he makes these metro cards

129
00:06:57,619 --> 00:07:02,189
and uh... the hacker spirit is is so
contagious that uh... he is actually

130
00:07:02,189 --> 00:07:03,430
decided to

131
00:07:03,430 --> 00:07:06,279
risk everything and come down here in
speaking all

132
00:07:06,279 --> 00:07:07,058
so well

133
00:07:07,059 --> 00:07:09,580
without further ado

134
00:07:09,580 --> 00:07:16,580
are anonymous transit authority
spokesperson

135
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:41,399
humility nicely from libya three years
ago

136
00:07:41,569 --> 00:07:42,830
fault

137
00:07:42,830 --> 00:07:47,188
and then you'll get a little more credit
when he used the word program are and

138
00:07:47,189 --> 00:07:49,279
what is known as a railroad clerk

139
00:07:49,279 --> 00:07:53,349
what the probably could call itself in
the seller

140
00:07:53,349 --> 00:07:58,000
although it's not a great job but it
pays the bills

141
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,759
office for is a major part goes

142
00:08:00,759 --> 00:08:05,309
all we've got a little document that
supposedly with the developed couple

143
00:08:05,309 --> 00:08:08,330
hundred copies i see a lot of them here
that's good

144
00:08:08,330 --> 00:08:12,380
renegades and in which uh... will be
available afterwards on a few other

145
00:08:12,380 --> 00:08:14,930
things that we've picked up

146
00:08:14,930 --> 00:08:20,210
but as far as we know that your card in
all internal documentation both ferreira

147
00:08:20,210 --> 00:08:22,979
clerks the friendly people and so
convinced

148
00:08:22,979 --> 00:08:27,818
and for uh... technicians states that
the card is

149
00:08:27,819 --> 00:08:30,339
a magnetic storage card

150
00:08:30,339 --> 00:08:35,009
uh... this could be disinformation but
somehow we really don't are we so i

151
00:08:35,009 --> 00:08:36,669
don't really think so

152
00:08:36,669 --> 00:08:40,059
uh... there we go to such great lengths

153
00:08:40,060 --> 00:08:43,830
signature card is essentially credit
card story scarred but smaller

154
00:08:43,830 --> 00:08:49,260
and of people seeing that uh... one in
my pocket which will hold up

155
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:55,210
because the magnetic stripe on it that's
brightly-colored

156
00:08:55,210 --> 00:08:59,280
it is not like systems in washington
d_c_ and other places

157
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:04,280
have the value printed on it

158
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:08,890
instead they're expected just like this
in turn star or a quote metro card

159
00:09:08,890 --> 00:09:09,729
reader

160
00:09:09,729 --> 00:09:12,000
in order to tell the value

161
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:17,160
the back of each card has three items
printed on it an expiration date

162
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:21,969
a six digit batch number which is the
same for at least every one hundred

163
00:09:21,970 --> 00:09:23,380
cards

164
00:09:23,380 --> 00:09:27,300
and a ten digit serial number

165
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:28,690
we also uh... uh...

166
00:09:28,690 --> 00:09:34,870
known to some extent what's on the
magnetic stripe or possibly barcode

167
00:09:34,870 --> 00:09:38,610
uh... they are the same things that are
physically printed on the back of the

168
00:09:38,610 --> 00:09:42,980
cards desperation date the batch number
and serial number

169
00:09:42,980 --> 00:09:44,590
the type of card

170
00:09:44,590 --> 00:09:48,250
isn't playing coated for fifteen dollars
is it more intrigued coated in other

171
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:51,210
words or is it going to do when they
look at the booth

172
00:09:51,210 --> 00:09:53,640
resident alien card

173
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:55,750
the current event on the card

174
00:09:55,750 --> 00:10:00,070
the date and time of last year since her
cell there's probably other information

175
00:10:00,070 --> 00:10:04,670
as a manual mentioned if it's a bar code
reader or even if it's a magnetic stripe

176
00:10:04,670 --> 00:10:07,370
were all that stored as a serial number

177
00:10:07,370 --> 00:10:12,630
this stuff is not actually on the card
instead you're getting it after it goes

178
00:10:12,630 --> 00:10:17,530
through turnstile to token booth
computer to an area computer to the main

179
00:10:17,530 --> 00:10:20,250
computer a transit authorities

180
00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:25,990
uh... building in the home thirty
livingston street in downtown brooklyn

181
00:10:25,990 --> 00:10:31,360
there are some arguments that it is
nynex striped having to do with that

182
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:33,810
namely that are

183
00:10:33,810 --> 00:10:37,780
turnstiles are supposed to take cards if
they become

184
00:10:37,780 --> 00:10:42,860
relieved only to the local taken this
computer and no higher up the hierarchy

185
00:10:42,860 --> 00:10:47,060
return sells for us to take three
thousand there is at that point

186
00:10:47,060 --> 00:10:51,190
was going to three thousand tokens to
thousands like him a card or combination

187
00:10:51,190 --> 00:10:52,150
thereof

188
00:10:52,150 --> 00:10:56,079
that sort of speaks against a
information acting interested on the

189
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:58,960
card

190
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:02,950
if there are you really do questions at
any point to ask if there's anything

191
00:11:02,950 --> 00:11:09,950
that's a good question say that man
purple with beard

192
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:14,600
salmon

193
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:18,770
but currently that's more manuals for
terry what i've heard about that is they

194
00:11:18,770 --> 00:11:20,810
use the commercial world

195
00:11:20,810 --> 00:11:27,810
territories said mechanism

196
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:39,000
whereas mister

197
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:50,820
uh... there is no evidence for doing the
laser it's not impossible

198
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:55,410
here are i mean when i entered a card
and six inches away from it there's no

199
00:11:55,410 --> 00:11:58,459
advice as to protecting your eyes

200
00:11:58,460 --> 00:12:02,490
brisbane reasonable really really show
up

201
00:12:02,490 --> 00:12:07,730
prisoner release to the mood from the
uh... slight include the area of retail

202
00:12:07,730 --> 00:12:09,530
removed and their

203
00:12:09,530 --> 00:12:16,530
uh... it as i said it's not impossible
it just seems unlikely

204
00:12:23,580 --> 00:12:30,580
listens even road this road speaks
against uh... that happening

205
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:41,040
exactly what the the the theoretical

206
00:12:45,620 --> 00:12:47,140
verified

207
00:12:47,140 --> 00:12:50,210
spacing

208
00:12:50,210 --> 00:12:52,780
v_c_r_

209
00:12:52,780 --> 00:12:59,780
burrows speaks against that going all
the way up the hierarchy before uh...

210
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:05,270
gone the other point talking to a local
computer system that uh...

211
00:13:05,270 --> 00:13:08,240
that is constantly updating with the
network

212
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:09,210
it to be done instantly

213
00:13:09,210 --> 00:13:12,060
and that's that's what i think it's
happening i think it's uh...

214
00:13:12,060 --> 00:13:14,930
it's accessing a system that's inside
the station

215
00:13:14,930 --> 00:13:19,210
and check in and seeing if i work with
particular debate is on the card

216
00:13:19,210 --> 00:13:22,600
and that nam that is updated

217
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:26,600
maybe i once every five minutes but it
was a retirement we don't know

218
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:29,900
what we need to tries to duplicate two
cars and try them on two separate

219
00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:32,850
stations at the same exact moment to see
what happens

220
00:13:32,850 --> 00:13:33,970
well tell us something

221
00:13:33,970 --> 00:13:37,950
all away of course is for couple were
missing configuration has a lot for

222
00:13:37,950 --> 00:13:41,380
questions about it is the microphone
over that ask questions

223
00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:46,280
uh... there are numerous said lectures
and software software and to some extent

224
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:49,600
the hardware as provided by tour
exploration

225
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:51,859
which i believe is from california

226
00:13:51,859 --> 00:13:55,639
there's also some uh... serious
anecdotal evidence that some of the

227
00:13:55,639 --> 00:13:57,619
writings c programming

228
00:13:57,619 --> 00:13:59,170
three language program

229
00:13:59,170 --> 00:14:01,820
was done by i_b_m_

230
00:14:01,820 --> 00:14:04,670
paul

231
00:14:04,670 --> 00:14:10,320
uh... among the glitches although it
supposedly there's multipart reagan if

232
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:13,680
you got several parts of her along one
day bought another one

233
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:17,619
response they'll take the value of their
own one card it won't happen

234
00:14:17,619 --> 00:14:22,360
don't even like the clerk triad uh...
either you or they will lose money

235
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:25,470
today never loses money i'd like to
point out if you walk away from it so

236
00:14:25,470 --> 00:14:29,130
that this was too much money two years
ago a note of that money that we're

237
00:14:29,130 --> 00:14:31,090
going to bruises

238
00:14:31,090 --> 00:14:33,510
uh...

239
00:14:33,510 --> 00:14:36,500
there's also some evidence of that uh...

240
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:42,390
analysis a recording of transactions at
the booth is not done which should be

241
00:14:42,390 --> 00:14:45,560
uh... someone i know i had a problem
with the passenger who alleged that

242
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:47,530
their carter though

243
00:14:47,530 --> 00:14:51,620
and long term for twenty dollars never
spend that money put on it

244
00:14:51,620 --> 00:14:54,420
supposedly we're told an internal memos

245
00:14:54,420 --> 00:14:59,060
that you can trace the transaction
verify whether or not it did occur

246
00:14:59,060 --> 00:15:02,660
uh... apparently that's impossible on
add-ons

247
00:15:02,660 --> 00:15:07,890
which shows as security guards if the
petition is ever possible

248
00:15:07,890 --> 00:15:11,980
uh... despite the fact that an analyst
says he has an employee have side

249
00:15:11,980 --> 00:15:13,240
examined etc

250
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:17,120
i don't believe that simply passing
who's a test

251
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:20,370
uh... actually used in training

252
00:15:20,370 --> 00:15:24,770
uh... it would be totally invalid on
uh...

253
00:15:24,770 --> 00:15:28,990
on the any machine that is something
that's confusing so i do believe

254
00:15:28,990 --> 00:15:31,270
or on turnstiles

255
00:15:31,270 --> 00:15:35,780
uh... i do have a place like this and
not doing so any great experimentation

256
00:15:35,780 --> 00:15:38,530
going to go on with it because

257
00:15:38,530 --> 00:15:42,640
i'd like to hang on to my job

258
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:48,960
a few other things opaque there is one
of known temporary successful defeat of

259
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:51,210
the master card system

260
00:15:51,210 --> 00:15:56,230
in around march of this year's someone
was arrested at the thirty fourth street

261
00:15:56,230 --> 00:15:59,860
and either seven third avenue for using
the card

262
00:15:59,860 --> 00:16:05,100
routine debate made by the following
athletes would a recording studio or a

263
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:06,270
tape recorder

264
00:16:06,270 --> 00:16:09,660
reportedly florence quotes a release and
friends

265
00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:13,240
on eight-track tape

266
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:17,490
mysterious plastic or cork board for it
and successfully entered in the uh...

267
00:16:17,490 --> 00:16:20,200
subway station

268
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:25,489
efficient transit authority lawyer on
how this person was caught is as follows

269
00:16:25,489 --> 00:16:29,459
do you know the same thing happened on
the central computer at one thirty one

270
00:16:29,459 --> 00:16:31,410
this is straight

271
00:16:31,410 --> 00:16:35,829
right i understand from other sources is
that no there is some cop standing

272
00:16:35,830 --> 00:16:41,170
around the sauce and i think what did it
look like a voter card out of his pocket

273
00:16:41,170 --> 00:16:44,459
this and then decide to go and ask
questions

274
00:16:44,459 --> 00:16:47,910
trust me is the obvious things like that
sir

275
00:16:47,910 --> 00:16:52,140
expresses somewhere

276
00:16:52,140 --> 00:16:53,650
uh...

277
00:16:53,650 --> 00:16:57,810
troubling breaking things they've got a
couple of screens which may be

278
00:16:57,810 --> 00:17:04,810
indicative of something to probably not
very useful

279
00:17:20,370 --> 00:17:24,190
personal and political judgment on
transparency for murder

280
00:17:24,190 --> 00:17:26,740
the up

281
00:17:26,740 --> 00:17:31,190
if you just think things the court can
examine uh... certainly uh... fields off

282
00:17:31,190 --> 00:17:33,520
a card with slight through

283
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:37,980
either uh... these flight uh... area of
the children with computer inside the

284
00:17:37,980 --> 00:17:38,590
brute

285
00:17:38,590 --> 00:17:43,199
onsite area directly under the clerk
solos outside the booth

286
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:48,080
but you're interesting things are what
pops up for passenger cars

287
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:54,129
remaining value in dollars and sense for
our card site which is even full-fare

288
00:17:54,130 --> 00:17:57,240
prion coded regard actually

289
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:59,760
expiration date now this is interesting

290
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:06,320
for both employees cards and passenger
cars expiration date is always one of

291
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:08,100
the very limited set

292
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:10,760
twenty three fifty nine pm

293
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:12,820
on the either april

294
00:18:12,820 --> 00:18:14,750
august or december

295
00:18:14,750 --> 00:18:16,650
on the last day of the month

296
00:18:16,650 --> 00:18:21,289
uh... the earliest one scene is april
thirtieth nineteen ninety five

297
00:18:21,289 --> 00:18:26,710
uh... blessed use date for both
passenger a random clearly cards

298
00:18:26,710 --> 00:18:30,860
for something called his own code which
aren't passenger coaches thirty two zero

299
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:33,020
stalled by a wine

300
00:18:33,020 --> 00:18:35,320
underneath there was some x's on route

301
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:36,279
given

302
00:18:36,279 --> 00:18:38,310
places

303
00:18:38,310 --> 00:18:43,480
uh... the include confirmed that exam
code is also does have the x_ is in the

304
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:44,960
same place

305
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:47,369
then there's a fruitful osorio

306
00:18:47,369 --> 00:18:49,330
which is always three

307
00:18:49,330 --> 00:18:53,590
withhold daily trips which is always
zero if you'll recall that substance

308
00:18:53,590 --> 00:18:56,000
code which is also a zero

309
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,800
uh... as i said it's interesting but
probably not useful

310
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:04,480
uh... for the literacy missing all the
sizes so you can always get cards in

311
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:08,600
multiples of five dollars you can only

interesting human engineering

318
00:19:24,330 --> 00:19:28,980
bolt overall i don't think it's really
the useful

319
00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:32,690

339
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:37,650

no i don't like his beloved

341
00:20:44,809 --> 00:20:49,450
it's hard to understand and i think
there's lots of time so

342
00:20:49,450 --> 00:20:52,180
but franklin's now most of them or not

343
00:20:52,180 --> 00:20:55,049
too yay you can really schmooze with
them

344
00:20:55,049 --> 00:20:58,790
sold complaining about the intervention
for something

345
00:20:58,790 --> 00:21:04,560
there from cuba corporation most of them

346
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:09,679
at sensible things are still done
in-house but uh... anywhere tronic stuff

347
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:11,520
on turnstiles

348
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:15,280
allowing them prided themselves they're
from cubic

349
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:22,280
millions for that

350
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:26,270
so now we're really dealing on the
technology there is some evidence

351
00:21:26,270 --> 00:21:30,020
however i don't know how many people are
familiar with an extra technology for

352
00:21:30,020 --> 00:21:31,230
credit cards

353
00:21:31,230 --> 00:21:35,720
there three fields uh... standard on a
minister usually for credit cards only

354
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:40,070
want to or used rooting for our area

355
00:21:40,070 --> 00:21:43,379
read a writer for the third area

356
00:21:43,380 --> 00:21:47,210
we believe that that's where there's a
lot of stuff

357
00:21:47,210 --> 00:21:54,210
gambling

358
00:22:00,660 --> 00:22:01,350
ct

359
00:22:01,350 --> 00:22:08,350
we know how i would come from a drug
dealer cameras and microphones center

360
00:22:13,410 --> 00:22:15,580
analysis so fast

361
00:22:15,580 --> 00:22:21,210
and also chosen a song that you are a
lot has happened in shamelessly when the

362
00:22:21,210 --> 00:22:23,510
first time that i do not deny

363
00:22:23,510 --> 00:22:25,000
their card so to speak

364
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:28,230
arm basically some of us for this to you
soon

365
00:22:28,230 --> 00:22:29,590

and find the defendant on the world
media

368
00:22:37,050 --> 00:22:38,610
nor did it twice

369
00:22:38,610 --> 00:22:42,480
the other is related to revive the
spirit of the second tunstall that

370
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:43,970
always happens

371
00:22:43,970 --> 00:22:48,420
an inspector handouts on that uh...
uh... if you do get that swipe at the

372

same turnstile do not get another turns
out

373
00:22:51,750 --> 00:22:57,120
are don't have an off an explanation why
that happens but it does happen

374
00:22:57,120 --> 00:23:02,520
on any other questions in the white
shirts for is not

375
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:06,240

how could you bring it up

380
00:23:20,590 --> 00:23:21,439
okay

381
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:25,780
valuable actually a sc

382
00:23:25,780 --> 00:23:27,889

into these drawings abuses about

homicide

390
00:24:01,550 --> 00:24:03,810
rather go to new jersey that often

391
00:24:03,810 --> 00:24:07,510
on us

392
00:24:07,510 --> 00:24:11,900
he certainly all that

00:24:26,090 --> 00:24:28,750
has also been some

397
00:24:28,750 --> 00:24:31,320
helmsley's understanding the dumpster

398
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:32,370
uh...

399
00:24:32,370 --> 00:24:36,900
there's a suggested the dumpster dive
san diego for children west inc

400
00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:41,300
ambrosia suggested the downstairs i
resided with recent history which is

401
00:24:41,300 --> 00:24:46,200
transitory headquarters remembering
livingston plaza which is uh...

402
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:50,590
who met were also i wasn't sure of the
main computer isn't

403
00:24:50,590 --> 00:24:54,419
uh... to recycle the office paper and
both of them

404
00:24:54,420 --> 00:24:58,610
vera it's relatively secure or i could
probably do it but they'd ask too many

405
00:24:58,610 --> 00:25:02,200
questions see me in the recycle paper
that

406
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:05,500
on the aisles

407
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:11,400
you

408
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:16,799
selfish and this is going to go and get
a handle on microphone

409
00:25:16,799 --> 00:25:23,210
administrators you can correlate daschle
turnstiles

410
00:25:23,210 --> 00:25:24,600
is are you

411
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:27,770
opening up the the reader writer there
wasn't much interesting in heaven on the

412
00:25:27,770 --> 00:25:32,870
side panel i was opened up there is a
keypad in their and there was also to on

413
00:25:32,870 --> 00:25:36,310
off switches one for regular power was
right in the center in the top of the

414
00:25:36,310 --> 00:25:38,480
panel one for battery back up

415
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:42,490
i guess that what they do is they
swiping natural like type card through

416
00:25:42,490 --> 00:25:45,600
that they can enter code in order to
access to the system

417
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:50,970
yanking record your honor you uh...
artsy tell you that access to the system

418
00:25:50,970 --> 00:25:52,220
on what he said

419
00:25:52,220 --> 00:25:56,139
but they were five optical mines leading
to through he said three seventy jay st

420
00:25:56,139 --> 00:26:00,059
uh... so what happens when the victim
plaza i don't know he said that the

421
00:26:00,059 --> 00:26:00,940
leaders

422
00:26:00,940 --> 00:26:02,240
worried right

423
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:05,930
once again it's just we told me he was
very friendly i didn't write down then

424
00:26:05,930 --> 00:26:08,110
the manuals that they had with them

425
00:26:08,110 --> 00:26:10,260
uh... hayward

426
00:26:10,260 --> 00:26:14,910
national learning center corporation
uh... wholesalers cubic in there was a

427
00:26:14,910 --> 00:26:20,500
whole i wrote a letter to emmanuel idaho
because published by six hundred

428
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:24,920
but uh... and that's i mean actual names
i guess i'll put it on whatever at least

429
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:29,310
i don't have any over here because i had
a printout jackpot winner overrun

430
00:26:29,310 --> 00:26:32,279
maintenance manual which is uh...

431
00:26:32,279 --> 00:26:36,760
freelance or someone's who want to know
about this mentioning sweet fruit ryrie

432
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:38,179
stuff there

433
00:26:38,179 --> 00:26:42,580
who's not terribly much that the women
we have to tell us the manuals at the

434
00:26:42,580 --> 00:26:44,549
stone made of uh...

435
00:26:44,549 --> 00:26:48,810
seeing or probably more useful but when
we start so far nothing

436
00:26:48,810 --> 00:26:52,620
uh... what's interesting about the
even-tempered moved computer is that

437
00:26:52,620 --> 00:26:54,700
there are two key slots

438
00:26:54,700 --> 00:26:59,970
run for our transit authority
supervisors one for cubic uh...

439
00:26:59,970 --> 00:27:02,730
technicians which uh... when you open
this

440
00:27:02,730 --> 00:27:06,990
and uh... indications supervisor
watching the case of both the swipe your

00:27:07,860 --> 00:27:11,950
uh... start house it gives you a
different menus and it does for the

443
00:27:11,950 --> 00:27:14,750

450
00:27:40,519 --> 00:27:43,900
as a manual mentioned there will be no
more tokens

451
00:27:43,900 --> 00:27:47,890

you go to machine you throw in whatever

453
00:27:52,890 --> 00:27:55,180
money that is needed for the good for

454
00:27:55,180 --> 00:27:57,019
just the one trip

455
00:27:57,019 --> 00:28:01,139
recap of from here

456
00:28:01,139 --> 00:28:06,179
soon if necessary out there and they're
transfer student passes and those who

457
00:28:06,179 --> 00:28:07,830
uses impasses

458
00:28:07,830 --> 00:28:12,409
rosenbloom since he was a good person
and probably have some sort of federal

459
00:28:12,410 --> 00:28:13,640
beyond it

460
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:15,700
uh... lol

461
00:28:15,700 --> 00:28:20,259
you're going to be able to purchase at
half price if you're a senior citizen

462
00:28:20,259 --> 00:28:21,830
additional rides

463
00:28:21,830 --> 00:28:26,178
and relieve stomach acid pro do your
thing broke through the number of rides

464
00:28:26,179 --> 00:28:26,999
at break

465
00:28:26,999 --> 00:28:30,580
so all those uh... delays of going
somewhere else on the way home from

466
00:28:30,580 --> 00:28:31,559
school

467
00:28:31,559 --> 00:28:33,889
but probably win and

general

478
00:30:23,950 --> 00:30:29,240
frankly i thought i was uh... actually
explorer william totenberg computers are

479
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:30,750
a number of uh...

480
00:30:30,750 --> 00:30:34,940
problems with that the greatest of which
is it's illegal

481
00:30:34,940 --> 00:30:39,539
uh... but their logistical problems
before and that any use of that the

482
00:30:39,539 --> 00:30:42,340
problem is that high would be identified

483
00:30:42,340 --> 00:30:47,490
saying we essentially workforce to brute
force packwood is sort of thing

484
00:30:47,490 --> 00:30:49,889
there was some talk a lot of

485
00:30:49,889 --> 00:30:54,380
experimented with oscilloscopes tonight
of course uh... as a manual has put in

486
00:30:54,380 --> 00:30:55,510
the schedule

487
00:30:55,510 --> 00:30:57,340
will get back to

488
00:30:57,340 --> 00:30:59,620
before

489
00:30:59,620 --> 00:31:02,230
before things are over

490
00:31:02,230 --> 00:31:09,230
brazil crosstalk it sounded interesting
was that guys

491
00:31:11,610 --> 00:31:14,590
here are some great over there and
telephones

492
00:31:14,590 --> 00:31:17,299
maturity for more forceful

493
00:31:17,299 --> 00:31:24,299
isn't connected so that there was a
free-standing then

494
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:33,960
thank you very much

495
00:31:34,410 --> 00:31:36,900
uh... somebody else

496
00:31:36,900 --> 00:31:43,900
brother had

497
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,549
uh...

498
00:31:47,549 --> 00:31:49,560
annemarie murderers who is uh...

499
00:31:49,560 --> 00:31:54,520
uh... we found our technical information
and also strike that

500
00:31:54,520 --> 00:32:01,440
pulling magnetic filings are such

501
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:07,269
i'm sorry

502
00:32:07,269 --> 00:32:08,280
only

503
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:11,168
that's what we know so far

504
00:32:11,169 --> 00:32:15,110
leverage for we don't have users
momentarily has tried putting iron

505
00:32:15,110 --> 00:32:17,770
filings a similar stuff on this thing

506
00:32:17,770 --> 00:32:19,720
insist that the uh...

507
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:23,009
actually works as a magnetic uh...

508
00:32:23,009 --> 00:32:24,510
intellectuals magnetic

509
00:32:24,510 --> 00:32:31,510
on the islands or the gray shirt

510
00:32:54,970 --> 00:32:58,830
you know how to play the uh... for
blueprint here apparently iron filings

511
00:32:58,830 --> 00:33:00,140
will work

512
00:33:00,140 --> 00:33:04,120
uh... already old technology seems to
everything and that sort of back so

513
00:33:04,120 --> 00:33:08,800
bright and it brought down to the guy i
thirty four states

514
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:15,800
regarding the red shirt and then the guy
sitting down next to him

515
00:33:17,380 --> 00:33:19,960
where there was a radio address to drive
the ah...

516
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:23,590
told the guy in purple in your neck of
the woods their by sitting down at a

517
00:33:23,590 --> 00:33:30,409
question

518
00:33:30,409 --> 00:33:35,120
uh... the problem with that is they
won't fit uh... there to wide

519
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:40,180
reflect actually very warm

520
00:33:40,180 --> 00:33:43,530
facil yeah that's a good idea if someone
can supply me with that old is an

521
00:33:43,530 --> 00:33:50,530
exhortation purple shirt and for the
rack

522
00:33:50,740 --> 00:33:57,260
there's some misleading the classifieds
ids forty six hundred

523
00:33:57,260 --> 00:34:00,408
i don't know i've ever use them

524
00:34:00,409 --> 00:34:07,409
uh... black shirt for five rows back

525
00:34:08,489 --> 00:34:11,670
exactly exactly however the distribute

526
00:34:11,670 --> 00:34:13,500
distributed network i do it

527
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:15,109
i can talk and that is fine

528
00:34:15,109 --> 00:34:19,038
uh... sounds good to know if it and as
far as bus technology goes in other

529
00:34:19,039 --> 00:34:26,039
words if it's downloaded locally

530
00:34:30,409 --> 00:34:35,700
amroma likelihood of the bus so i can so
we going over radios pretty unlikely as

531
00:34:35,700 --> 00:34:39,429
as was mentioned what's likely to happen
is that there will be stored locally and

532
00:34:39,429 --> 00:34:41,619
then uh... downloaded every

533
00:34:41,619 --> 00:34:45,139
animal glass run now every eight hours
every day whatever

534
00:34:45,139 --> 00:34:52,139
lay in the back in the center sending

535
00:35:05,059 --> 00:35:06,000

00:35:10,539 --> 00:35:16,409
announces a large group of people going
somewhere tonight lineup

538
00:35:16,409 --> 00:35:23,409
uh... was short uh... staff person in a
red shirt or a person standing mail

539
00:35:24,809 --> 00:35:26,599
hasn't yet

540
00:35:26,599 --> 00:35:33,599
or they'll take love the guy in the pure
single

541
00:36:09,109 --> 00:36:10,939
arnold

542
00:36:10,939 --> 00:36:17,939
would put a booked on a very attractive
idea with that still work if that was so

543
00:36:25,809 --> 00:36:32,809
front one side of the slaughter

544
00:36:37,220 --> 00:36:42,780
parasite in here that the carolinas duo
is intolerable

545
00:36:42,780 --> 00:36:46,510
on the list right it's probably remain
order to defeat

546
00:36:46,510 --> 00:36:48,349
just passing it through

547
00:36:48,349 --> 00:36:55,349
uh... on the aisle

548
00:36:57,479 --> 00:36:58,589
what's there

549
00:36:58,589 --> 00:37:00,269

00:37:01,749 --> 00:37:05,249

hair

555
00:37:21,379 --> 00:37:25,269
it's not impossible frankly my feeling
that i have removed from the transit

556
00:37:25,269 --> 00:37:26,819
authority for three years

557
00:37:26,819 --> 00:37:31,899
is uh... they're paranoid enough to do
that

558
00:37:31,899 --> 00:37:38,899
franz ferdinand

559
00:37:39,149 --> 00:37:41,929
uh... it might goodnight

560
00:37:41,929 --> 00:37:45,889
with blue cross is a very good credence
to the official landslide regarding a

00:37:45,889 --> 00:37:48,709
possible trouble on computer

562
00:37:48,709 --> 00:37:55,709
uh... in the front of the first rule

563
00:38:03,639 --> 00:38:07,669

565
00:38:09,059 --> 00:38:11,539
uh... probably not

566
00:38:11,539 --> 00:38:15,369
well the flowers or built right for a
few days

567
00:38:15,369 --> 00:38:18,759
to hang onto it for so many laughter it
should be able to get uh...

568
00:38:18,759 --> 00:38:21,279
an email address for me

569
00:38:21,279 --> 00:38:23,569
possibly

570
00:38:23,569 --> 00:38:25,439
incorrectly

571
00:38:25,439 --> 00:38:28,229

retirement actual hundred blindfolds
coming back to a hundred

574
00:38:39,579 --> 00:38:41,519
and uh...

575
00:38:41,519 --> 00:38:46,789
it's kind of a hundred has the same time

576
00:38:46,789 --> 00:38:48,429
the slide into justin

577
00:38:48,429 --> 00:38:51,049
packing one hundred has the same batch
number

578
00:38:51,049 --> 00:38:58,049
and uh... each card has an individual
serial number

579
00:39:03,599 --> 00:39:06,650
uh... that's an interesting question
what happens if someone shows up with

580
00:39:06,650 --> 00:39:08,909
slightly different card

581
00:39:08,909 --> 00:39:12,949
it depends andrew uh... the door for a
really if you cut the top of the card

582
00:39:12,949 --> 00:39:13,979
off

583
00:39:13,979 --> 00:39:18,410
it doesn't reflect the new thing the
good morning to you can still use it

584
00:39:18,410 --> 00:39:20,000
if you want to move forward

585
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:24,049
we can uh... it'd take the money off the
first time to put on a second one

586
00:39:24,049 --> 00:39:27,229
if you have a program to blunt that the
magnetic strip

587
00:39:27,229 --> 00:39:31,109
sometimes the real story lurks sometimes
they were too badly

588
00:39:31,109 --> 00:39:33,060
sometimes are not workable

589
00:39:33,060 --> 00:39:36,799
if you put in the past and welcome to
you

590
00:39:36,799 --> 00:39:40,000
if you're going to determine how much
money was still on the card

591
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:44,619
we can give him a card under oath or
whoever was a week

592
00:39:44,619 --> 00:39:45,549

know what their

601
00:40:09,549 --> 00:40:15,579
uh... interesting from those you can get
a car with cash if you go karting tokens

602
00:40:15,579 --> 00:40:19,569
but you can't own a probe into cash or
tokens that a third of those

603
00:40:19,569 --> 00:40:23,619
uh... growth slows suburb of those
crimes you may recall properly roosevelt

00:40:23,619 --> 00:40:26,499
they'll remove cash in on the tokens of

there's a question where her back

i've had that thought uh...

608
00:40:53,859 --> 00:40:56,859

632
00:43:03,659 --> 00:43:08,730
will probably happen since i was
wondering when ross perot systems noida

633
00:43:08,730 --> 00:43:13,769
maharashtra parenteral so i don't know
if it was wrong

00:43:13,769 --> 00:43:15,119
emerald

635
00:43:15,119 --> 00:43:20,759
where are the slides four twenty five
thousand thinks most law

636
00:43:20,759 --> 00:43:24,229
by our own interests are seeking refuge
in him

637
00:43:24,229 --> 00:43:29,099
ground so as long as you know just
upload fluid

638
00:43:29,099 --> 00:43:34,319
sometimes with the muslim overlays
around a little

639
00:43:34,319 --> 00:43:39,009
knowing full well you know it was the
most listeners worries

640
00:43:39,010 --> 00:43:41,670
doesn't go well

641
00:43:41,670 --> 00:43:42,749
uh...

642
00:43:42,749 --> 00:43:47,109
artificial tokens sounds like a rose
throughout likely high-tech accurate

643
00:43:47,109 --> 00:43:48,819
still possible

644
00:43:48,819 --> 00:43:55,819
uh... i will not go through a full books
read restauranteurs

645
00:43:55,940 --> 00:43:58,529
uh... any other questions

uh... purple shirt in the back and more

649
00:44:17,219 --> 00:44:18,329
i don't know

650
00:44:18,329 --> 00:44:25,329
we're trying to find out

651
00:44:25,949 --> 00:44:28,199
might

652
00:44:28,199 --> 00:44:31,639
doesn't passwords must meet the has
influenced our readers as it were mostly

653
00:44:31,639 --> 00:44:33,009
turnstiles or

654
00:44:33,009 --> 00:44:35,920
stainless steel they're pretty secure to

655
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:40,109
and i'm sure two hundred dollar as it's
called the jaws of life with the flu

656
00:44:40,109 --> 00:44:41,379

657
00:44:41,379 --> 00:44:45,729
hahahahahaha remember character or level

660
00:44:51,769 --> 00:44:58,769
uh... when we were running the brunch

661
00:45:01,499 --> 00:45:05,619
sound

662
00:45:05,619 --> 00:45:12,619
the

663
00:45:18,959 --> 00:45:25,959
all right

664
00:45:26,739 --> 00:45:30,269
duran is prohibited

665
00:45:30,269 --> 00:45:31,599

667
00:45:33,459 --> 00:45:40,459
more you're well aware the it

668
00:45:41,039 --> 00:45:47,769
dole is the with the issues or worse

669
00:45:47,769 --> 00:45:48,430
offers

670
00:45:48,430 --> 00:45:52,058
more u_s_ paul

671
00:45:52,059 --> 00:45:57,359
wrestling or wrestling i appreciate your
veggie singles that would never go

672
00:45:57,359 --> 00:46:00,869
slowly so astonishing throughout

673
00:46:00,869 --> 00:46:06,999
at for instance literally angela as a
summary of your account

674
00:46:06,999 --> 00:46:09,779
places the thought that was a bit

675
00:46:09,779 --> 00:46:16,779
restaurant brian wants

676
00:46:19,179 --> 00:46:21,859
disparaging things out

677
00:46:21,859 --> 00:46:26,199
apparently running through the northern
martha we need to talk with

678
00:46:26,199 --> 00:46:30,690
possible residents not to spread as far
as i listen to my scandalous rose uh...

679
00:46:30,690 --> 00:46:32,359
clearly we are

680
00:46:32,359 --> 00:46:35,399
uh... the stress over the last couple of
it that later

681
00:46:35,399 --> 00:46:39,629
uh... had been to figure out what it's
all about

682
00:46:39,629 --> 00:46:41,220
this uh... melissa

683
00:46:41,220 --> 00:46:44,049
from uh... san francisco

684
00:46:44,049 --> 00:46:46,739
throughout has had quite a few ah...

685
00:46:46,739 --> 00:46:48,369
enterprise system

686
00:46:48,369 --> 00:46:51,649
has has has held back down

687
00:46:51,649 --> 00:46:53,538
he had a complete

688
00:46:53,539 --> 00:46:58,519
uh... cracked that system and they do
not appreciate that

689
00:46:58,519 --> 00:46:59,220
had to

690
00:46:59,220 --> 00:47:00,529
you actually think of

691
00:47:00,529 --> 00:47:01,400
for information

692
00:47:01,400 --> 00:47:04,039
power tactics that way

693
00:47:04,039 --> 00:47:11,039
process

694
00:47:13,089 --> 00:47:15,549
well at this point

695
00:47:15,549 --> 00:47:16,249
okay

696
00:47:16,249 --> 00:47:18,959
follows

697
00:47:18,959 --> 00:47:22,638
was the first time actually seeing what
uh... remains this look like

698
00:47:22,639 --> 00:47:24,789
the fact is when i was uh...

699
00:47:24,789 --> 00:47:26,399
start out his own

700
00:47:26,399 --> 00:47:28,368
where you approach

701
00:47:28,369 --> 00:47:31,259
taken care of a magnetic strip tease

702
00:47:31,259 --> 00:47:35,459
buses get some money that you're usually
very fine iron filings

703
00:47:35,459 --> 00:47:37,649
really need a few milligrams of them

704
00:47:37,649 --> 00:47:42,368
so it's my file and mail it something
reconstruction shop he would be adequate

705
00:47:42,369 --> 00:47:46,339
sprinkle them on the on the mag stripe
as we've done here

706
00:47:46,339 --> 00:47:48,129
and shake it around and then

707
00:47:48,129 --> 00:47:51,149
reactors sometimes right up the car

708
00:47:51,149 --> 00:47:54,499
until you can see a very clear tracing
it'll get clear

709
00:47:54,499 --> 00:47:58,229
there's going to declare it a point and
then we'll get weaker we'll soon find

710
00:47:58,229 --> 00:48:00,849
out where you can get the best i look at

711
00:48:00,849 --> 00:48:05,049
printed a pieces cellophane tape uh...
especially for every call it here

712
00:48:05,049 --> 00:48:08,109
and making the too much of the
fingerprint wants to go up a person to

713
00:48:08,109 --> 00:48:09,449
save it

714
00:48:09,449 --> 00:48:15,279
that way you can tell of what the format
is in this case it's a two-track format

715
00:48:15,279 --> 00:48:16,199
bouchard

716
00:48:16,199 --> 00:48:20,599
it looks like it's autocratic ariba
tracks one indivisible wire track which

717
00:48:20,599 --> 00:48:22,389
would be tracks uh...

718
00:48:22,389 --> 00:48:25,409
uh... two and three combined

719
00:48:25,409 --> 00:48:30,479
uh... it looks like the domains are not
angled unlike the washington d_c_ metro

720
00:48:30,479 --> 00:48:31,549
and bart

721
00:48:31,549 --> 00:48:32,919
dangle the

722
00:48:32,919 --> 00:48:37,949
the domains in clockwise direction at
about sitemap degrees

723
00:48:37,949 --> 00:48:42,219
but these look like ordinary like uh...
credit card or a style uh...

724
00:48:42,219 --> 00:48:46,139
remains the looks like it's about a
hundred and twenty perhaps

725
00:48:46,139 --> 00:48:48,339
it sounds very conventional to me

726
00:48:48,339 --> 00:48:50,990
now once you know what uh... with the
shape those

727
00:48:50,990 --> 00:48:53,549
the shaping looks of the tracks are

728
00:48:53,549 --> 00:48:57,129
because she'll be in a track record for
this you just need a redefined ahead

729
00:48:57,129 --> 00:48:59,788
like for a company like michigan
magnetics

730
00:48:59,789 --> 00:49:02,859
that has uh... this particular of
pattern

731
00:49:02,859 --> 00:49:06,609
now once you have that taking care of

732
00:49:06,609 --> 00:49:09,788
despite time for action all you do not
to do is uh...

733
00:49:09,789 --> 00:49:12,689
is make the device like it was uh...
shown an ultra six hundred it really

734
00:49:12,689 --> 00:49:15,348
works and get used to how we use it and
ah...

735
00:49:15,349 --> 00:49:18,239
when your copy sounds like your mission
a log

736
00:49:18,239 --> 00:49:19,809
we got a card

737
00:49:19,809 --> 00:49:21,509
and uh...

738
00:49:21,509 --> 00:49:23,249
reliable

739
00:49:23,249 --> 00:49:26,869
and how much of this i really should be
saying i just kind of that

740
00:49:26,869 --> 00:49:30,079
i mean i talk about this in european
time allotted time a little bit of fun

741
00:49:30,079 --> 00:49:32,929
here

742
00:49:32,929 --> 00:49:36,880
army

743
00:49:36,880 --> 00:49:40,229
went to work exactly what i'm wearing
them so you know what a guided tour of

744
00:49:40,229 --> 00:49:42,189
goa climate org

745
00:49:42,189 --> 00:49:45,529
do informational purposes only

746
00:49:45,529 --> 00:49:48,630
bill course is for informational
purposes only by the disclaimers or but

747
00:49:48,630 --> 00:49:52,139
usually

748
00:49:52,139 --> 00:49:53,819
but i

749
00:49:53,819 --> 00:49:55,649
so what

750
00:49:55,649 --> 00:49:58,939
this looks very conventional i don't
know her the story about somebody trying

751
00:49:58,939 --> 00:50:00,959
to get one of the santiago

752
00:50:00,959 --> 00:50:02,239
on the odd

753
00:50:02,239 --> 00:50:03,799
a book ah...

754
00:50:03,799 --> 00:50:06,059
a book that tape eraser and not working

755
00:50:06,059 --> 00:50:08,469
there's a distinct possibility here

756
00:50:08,469 --> 00:50:12,619
but i don't uh... but this is the like
it's odd

757
00:50:12,619 --> 00:50:17,099
doesn't seem like a tight as it was
calling uh... a magnetic watermark

758
00:50:17,099 --> 00:50:18,600
it's a very hard and

759
00:50:18,600 --> 00:50:21,219
they make field is very hard to race

760
00:50:21,219 --> 00:50:25,289
but has to be included a elevated
temperature on a special material and it

761
00:50:25,289 --> 00:50:26,549
will not uh...

762
00:50:26,549 --> 00:50:30,529
there were lots of allow itself to be
swiped at embraced at today's low

763
00:50:30,529 --> 00:50:32,519
temperature

764
00:50:32,519 --> 00:50:35,869
another possibly which is not true this
card but i i would think they would've

765
00:50:35,869 --> 00:50:39,569
been smart enough to try business i can
just tell a look at this it'll be done

766
00:50:39,569 --> 00:50:46,308
easily and don't ask me how to do it
because i have no part of this

767
00:50:46,309 --> 00:50:49,499
uh... if they were really be smart they
would use a system like on the japanese

768
00:50:49,499 --> 00:50:51,910
phone cards collabera domains

769
00:50:51,910 --> 00:50:55,348
and uh... to bring to the maze a surface
it requires a bs

770
00:50:55,349 --> 00:50:56,330
bias

771
00:50:56,330 --> 00:50:57,629
magnetic field

772
00:50:57,629 --> 00:51:01,808
in other words like every other i_d_c_
may make field like a permanent magnet

773
00:51:01,809 --> 00:51:04,479
at the right level to make the domains
come to the surface

774
00:51:04,479 --> 00:51:08,359
then and only then can you read and
write the card

775
00:51:08,359 --> 00:51:09,899
that uh...

776
00:51:09,899 --> 00:51:14,109
that apparently has been very successful
in japan on the phone cards in the wall

777
00:51:14,109 --> 00:51:16,409
a few people can do it but uh...

778
00:51:16,409 --> 00:51:19,819
most people really aren't aware how to
do that and uh...

779
00:51:19,819 --> 00:51:23,589
organized or so here we can talk about
that that that much more

780
00:51:23,589 --> 00:51:26,139
but that's another subject

781
00:51:26,139 --> 00:51:33,139
answering questions

782
00:51:45,499 --> 00:51:47,709
let's go ahead

783
00:51:47,709 --> 00:51:49,489
pale

784
00:51:49,489 --> 00:51:54,529
as to speed changes of the equalization
characteristics of the

785
00:51:54,529 --> 00:51:57,919
i believe that white electron ics uh...
have to change

786
00:51:57,919 --> 00:52:01,359
and suddenly because they sure were true
i guess the baccarat four-to-one speed

787
00:52:01,359 --> 00:52:02,319
range

788
00:52:02,319 --> 00:52:05,199
which isn't too extreme and then you can
shape the pollsters

789
00:52:05,199 --> 00:52:06,709
and uh... uh...

790
00:52:06,709 --> 00:52:09,459
the nuclear power

791
00:52:09,459 --> 00:52:12,319
ho

792
00:52:12,319 --> 00:52:17,058
uh... it is possible globally this card
is designed this contract is is simply a

793
00:52:17,059 --> 00:52:20,470
track of one zero one zero it's nothing
more than a day off

794
00:52:20,470 --> 00:52:21,920
a timing track

795
00:52:21,920 --> 00:52:26,839
but i mean track produces as is the true
it tells it tells the system hall fast

796
00:52:26,839 --> 00:52:28,409
you are on a

797
00:52:28,409 --> 00:52:30,769
you are sliding uh...

798
00:52:30,769 --> 00:52:33,739
we're sliding the card of

799
00:52:33,739 --> 00:52:38,769
soviet sold synchronize distracted can
reading right through that

800
00:52:38,769 --> 00:52:45,769
to remain strikers were slaves were

801
00:52:53,369 --> 00:53:00,369
yesterday a magnetic watermark

802
00:53:03,179 --> 00:53:06,859
this card is not of that system let me
tell you artists i was just quickly

803
00:53:06,859 --> 00:53:11,769
going into other systems that have been
uh... use dot

804
00:53:11,769 --> 00:53:13,650
throughout the world this is uh...

805
00:53:13,650 --> 00:53:18,899
this is as expected a fairly low tech
system that uh...

806
00:53:18,899 --> 00:53:22,249
i mean is that this is not it's not like
i credit cards in germany or anything

807
00:53:22,249 --> 00:53:29,249
like that

808
00:53:31,029 --> 00:53:32,679
personally that's that

809
00:53:32,679 --> 00:53:36,469
certainly all at all if you look at the
pattern here there's a one track that is

810
00:53:36,469 --> 00:53:37,269
of

811
00:53:37,269 --> 00:53:41,119
approximately ah... five millimeters
wide in another tractors about nine

812
00:53:41,119 --> 00:53:42,699
millimeters wide

813
00:53:42,699 --> 00:53:46,459
so the best thing is to get ahead that
that that set pattern

814
00:53:46,459 --> 00:53:50,599
another pro-choice i've never seen tried
before to reproduce what this is just to

815
00:53:50,599 --> 00:53:52,959
use of the audience

816
00:53:52,959 --> 00:53:56,059
so you can do that your course can
pretty much uh...

817
00:53:56,059 --> 00:54:01,559
copy anything if it was a fancy of
magnetic system

818
00:54:01,559 --> 00:54:03,969
mhm

819
00:54:03,969 --> 00:54:05,639
you

820
00:54:05,639 --> 00:54:08,229
be anythign

821
00:54:08,229 --> 00:54:10,289
lives that uh... are looking at the card

822
00:54:10,289 --> 00:54:14,750
i know exactly how they can uh... it
read and write to discard look at the

823
00:54:14,750 --> 00:54:15,829
obvious

824
00:54:15,829 --> 00:54:18,899
holly can read and write to this card

825
00:54:18,899 --> 00:54:22,529
review put put it through because they
have the that synchronization track one

826
00:54:22,529 --> 00:54:23,619
zero one zero

827
00:54:23,619 --> 00:54:26,749
which uh... since polls this is ok next
yr may next elaine

828
00:54:26,749 --> 00:54:31,010
so it by counting the polls is going on
the stops uh... uh...

829
00:54:31,010 --> 00:54:36,300
absorbed in our synchronize their
manually deliver your comment about that

830
00:54:36,300 --> 00:54:38,109
is that uh...

831
00:54:38,109 --> 00:54:41,700
when selecting a truthful to to computer
or a new year

832
00:54:41,700 --> 00:54:45,319
passengers like unit directly in front
of the clerks window

833
00:54:45,319 --> 00:54:50,079
you sometimes get an error message that
says a word of exactly

834
00:54:50,079 --> 00:54:51,159
uh...

835
00:54:51,159 --> 00:54:54,719
repair if you're really blair lifted
during a read

836
00:54:54,719 --> 00:54:56,629
so that tends to uh...

837
00:54:56,629 --> 00:55:01,419
bear that out if you look it up it does
agree to properly

838
00:55:01,419 --> 00:55:04,220
or just say you know i have to have with
the tracks right

839
00:55:04,220 --> 00:55:07,910
well yeah but you know you can get
through to almost all the way that all

840
00:55:07,910 --> 00:55:12,388
children it'll come out with that

841
00:55:12,389 --> 00:55:15,879
architecture is that because constantly

842
00:55:15,879 --> 00:55:16,980
angiogram

843
00:55:16,980 --> 00:55:18,559
pathetic

844
00:55:18,559 --> 00:55:22,769
fully i've only managed to ride the
subway once since i've been

845
00:55:22,769 --> 00:55:24,130
in new york so i don't

846
00:55:24,130 --> 00:55:28,230
really know about its overall operations
when

847
00:55:28,230 --> 00:55:30,069
you

848
00:55:30,069 --> 00:55:33,279
leading opera

849
00:55:33,279 --> 00:55:36,750
truthfully is there any he's just to
make your review

850
00:55:36,750 --> 00:55:37,930
phase

851
00:55:37,930 --> 00:55:40,399
mighty meeting

852
00:55:40,399 --> 00:55:42,479
who's going to make it not right

853
00:55:42,479 --> 00:55:44,020
well if you were due on

854
00:55:44,020 --> 00:55:47,169
if you were to probably be just put a
piece of tape over the

855
00:55:47,169 --> 00:55:52,069
and lower half of this terrific related
civilization track is here that the lord

856
00:55:52,069 --> 00:55:55,009
has to take over the lower half it would
probably

857
00:55:55,009 --> 00:55:59,789
it would probably be i think history
will prolly delivery but not right

858
00:55:59,789 --> 00:56:06,789
and dangerously fast

859
00:56:09,849 --> 00:56:13,069
pieces

860
00:56:13,069 --> 00:56:16,419
some sort of free trade because it or
not

861
00:56:16,419 --> 00:56:21,799
okay there they regard outside rivera
trailer expecially tapes

862
00:56:21,799 --> 00:56:25,689
register voters roads at the met with
this one says that the very short right

863
00:56:25,689 --> 00:56:29,328
to suha help her

864
00:56:29,329 --> 00:56:33,579
family on or about the actual uh...
physical pictures of it but just

865
00:56:33,579 --> 00:56:36,139
artists know about the uh... the

866
00:56:36,139 --> 00:56:37,940
resume makes tribes and others

867
00:56:37,940 --> 00:56:40,579
this type of biotechnology

868
00:56:40,579 --> 00:56:42,619
uh... back there

869
00:56:42,619 --> 00:56:49,619
in the green scarf

870
00:56:52,689 --> 00:56:54,209
grad

871
00:56:54,209 --> 00:56:56,679
i'm just look at this card right now

872
00:56:56,679 --> 00:57:03,679
is the growth of

873
00:57:11,299 --> 00:57:12,119
uh...

874
00:57:12,119 --> 00:57:14,440
uh... you get a uh... i get a card
reader

875
00:57:14,440 --> 00:57:18,399
or the vice into that there are some
here are my cousin who's got them

876
00:57:18,399 --> 00:57:20,689
larnaca get persons involved in this

877
00:57:20,689 --> 00:57:23,379
but uh...

878
00:57:23,379 --> 00:57:24,409
with that

879
00:57:24,409 --> 00:57:27,609
the synchronization track is always the
same but the read write part is of

880
00:57:27,609 --> 00:57:32,609
course it has to have different data

881
00:57:32,609 --> 00:57:39,609
power

882
00:57:47,719 --> 00:57:49,569
dust in the car

883
00:57:49,569 --> 00:57:56,109
and uh... i don't really fast forward
nature the question

884
00:57:56,109 --> 00:58:00,479
new cardholder input sketch sleep over
it not that i know it sounds like an

885
00:58:00,479 --> 00:58:06,579
interesting avenue of attack

886
00:58:06,579 --> 00:58:13,579
uh... brian the stretcher anak

887
00:58:20,149 --> 00:58:25,078
a earlier taken with computers for a
period

888
00:58:25,079 --> 00:58:31,929
or only turns those who are very

889
00:58:31,929 --> 00:58:35,439
it's an interesting thought uh... oh i
believe that there is a timeout

890
00:58:35,439 --> 00:58:40,069
mechanism of got copies of the lick your
book uh... manual lying around here

891
00:58:40,070 --> 00:58:44,139
and retirement mechanism that the time
of

892
00:58:44,139 --> 00:58:47,519
monroe five seconds between uh...

893
00:58:47,519 --> 00:58:51,619
intruding media uber tokens or uh...

894
00:58:51,619 --> 00:58:56,639
mastercard

895
00:58:56,639 --> 00:59:02,829
once every five surgeons narrowly

896
00:59:02,829 --> 00:59:09,829
diana stripe on the wall again

897
00:59:12,049 --> 00:59:17,179
yellow at you essentially the guy
upfront asked a similar question

898
00:59:17,179 --> 00:59:20,619
and there was a mechanism to set them on
the turnstiles

899
00:59:20,619 --> 00:59:26,539
the timing between run entry in the next
century and would default minimum time

900
00:59:26,539 --> 00:59:29,919
heals i believe five seconds

901
00:59:29,919 --> 00:59:36,879
innumerable matt that's their restaurant
now in the green room you know

902
00:59:36,879 --> 00:59:38,578
let's compare the bar card

903
00:59:38,579 --> 00:59:41,979
uh... as i said before there is a

904
00:59:41,979 --> 00:59:44,159
soprano differences

905
00:59:44,159 --> 00:59:46,710
is that history elbow to rise

906
00:59:46,710 --> 00:59:50,619
uh... dr therefore i can use the
standard manchester coding

907
00:59:50,619 --> 00:59:53,889
because it does this mean is going
through and sell clock and read right

908
00:59:53,889 --> 00:59:55,649
since this one uh...

909
00:59:55,649 --> 00:59:58,190
this is this one has to actually write a
card

910
00:59:58,190 --> 01:00:00,229
when you are swept me through

911
01:00:00,229 --> 01:00:02,659
we have to use a special uh...

912
01:00:02,659 --> 01:00:04,249
synchronization track

913
01:00:04,249 --> 01:00:05,269
and uh...

914
01:00:05,269 --> 01:00:08,999
fully with us this top secret as asian
track is it possible to uh...

915
01:00:08,999 --> 01:00:11,919
or to write

916
01:00:11,919 --> 01:00:15,328
there's one data track which is the
right track it's about a benign milne

917
01:00:15,329 --> 01:00:18,559
here's why didn't he was like a
five-millimeter white uh...

918
01:00:18,559 --> 01:00:19,950
synchronization track

919
01:00:19,950 --> 01:00:26,950
which is on the topic

920
01:00:40,549 --> 01:00:44,119
door people feel you have a few bodies
still really wants to do this on the

921
01:00:44,119 --> 01:00:45,529
encouraging it but uh...

922
01:00:45,529 --> 01:00:49,719
what did you see is old or cards and you
could buy a house speaker magnet will be

923
01:00:49,719 --> 01:00:54,219
gone he could get a five dollar card was
a personal rights would never bring card

924
01:00:54,219 --> 01:00:58,269
to play with

925
01:00:58,269 --> 01:01:03,949
feed

926
01:01:03,949 --> 01:01:07,529
happy

927
01:01:07,529 --> 01:01:10,569
i reiterate

928
01:01:10,569 --> 01:01:14,179
okay so s use a systematic coding system
where one of the tracks is actually a

929
01:01:14,179 --> 01:01:21,179
synchronization track

930
01:01:22,739 --> 01:01:23,899
this possible

931
01:01:23,899 --> 01:01:27,078
omitted vivid malta track system you
could actually use

932
01:01:27,079 --> 01:01:30,929
the tracking through this all is not
just a coincidence the other track

933
01:01:30,929 --> 01:01:33,149
synchronizing why your ah...

934
01:01:33,149 --> 01:01:36,379
brighter writing to another traci but
billy wright to one track at the time it

935
01:01:36,379 --> 01:01:38,469
seems that uh... type of system

936
01:01:38,469 --> 01:01:42,440
so busy with the possible i just never
seen it done so i've seen on may eight

937
01:01:42,440 --> 01:01:43,869
cars a_t_m_ cards

938
01:01:43,869 --> 01:01:45,449
what have you that

939
01:01:45,449 --> 01:01:52,449
do have a secret is asian track it's
nothing more than that

940
01:02:05,289 --> 01:02:12,289
parties

941
01:02:23,209 --> 01:02:25,350
gutters

942
01:02:25,350 --> 01:02:27,420
goldman

943
01:02:27,420 --> 01:02:30,099
multi-part poorer

944
01:02:30,099 --> 01:02:34,549
comes up on the the screen what you're
doing radiohead quoting analysis so that

945
01:02:34,549 --> 01:02:37,309
is as well

946
01:02:37,309 --> 01:02:40,959
coated with this

947
01:02:40,959 --> 01:02:45,400
so you're out of their similarities

948
01:02:45,400 --> 01:02:47,749
do different things to remember

949
01:02:47,749 --> 01:02:52,959
to admire money uh... totaling carter
that's what i'm going to item on the

950
01:02:52,959 --> 01:02:57,619
screen etc hard it's going back down to
zero it's a different menu item

951
01:02:57,619 --> 01:02:59,289
uh...

952
01:02:59,289 --> 01:03:03,619

filed

985
01:05:28,459 --> 01:05:30,109
does uh...

986
01:05:30,109 --> 01:05:34,589
those of our people on olympic gymnastic
body this but the way they look at it is

987
01:05:34,589 --> 01:05:35,519
just that

988
01:05:35,519 --> 01:05:39,599
because uh... on some of us new house
system work or danger she had to be

989
01:05:39,599 --> 01:05:40,749
arrested

990
01:05:40,749 --> 01:05:42,399
but does that simple

991
01:05:42,399 --> 01:05:45,279
highly-paid it's uh...

992
01:05:45,279 --> 01:05:47,669
i mean it's this um...

993
01:05:47,669 --> 01:05:49,828
i don't think i look at you nicely

994
01:05:49,829 --> 01:05:53,619
listed on the state that's a revenue and
there's people's jobs and on the line

995
01:05:53,619 --> 01:06:00,619
anybody utica funny uh... view here i
think all over america it seems a

996
01:06:00,649 --> 01:06:05,049
goes as far as legal ramifications with
the new york city transit authority okay

997
01:06:05,049 --> 01:06:06,889
first for passengers

998
01:06:06,889 --> 01:06:11,359

heavenly for some wall

1000
01:06:13,390 --> 01:06:17,879

of that would cover that incident under

01:06:25,759 --> 01:06:27,299

1006
01:06:27,299 --> 01:06:28,559

still be would probably still be

1010
01:06:40,699 --> 01:06:44,289
considered festive service and possibly
worse

1011
01:06:44,289 --> 01:06:48,099
uh... there's also a new york state
against hacking

1012
01:06:48,099 --> 01:06:50,219
and from the freaking

1013
01:06:50,219 --> 01:06:57,219
uh... dot four rosanna from the middle
dot three rows from back

1014
01:07:05,439 --> 01:07:10,349
daily algiers the second half first is
this uh... improving tracking of

1015
01:07:10,349 --> 01:07:11,609
individuals

1016
01:07:11,609 --> 01:07:16,598
so far not really as uh... sort of
referral had a question earlier about

1017
01:07:16,599 --> 01:07:18,379
uh... student cards

1018
01:07:18,379 --> 01:07:21,220
for any sort of uh... reduced uh...

1019
01:07:21,220 --> 01:07:22,709
fare uh...

1020
01:07:22,709 --> 01:07:28,259
uh... retired there might be tracking
individuals because the reduced fare

1021
01:07:28,259 --> 01:07:29,909
uh...

1022
01:07:29,909 --> 01:07:33,659
promotes his uh... intrinsically
individual another if you get it because

1023
01:07:33,659 --> 01:07:35,439
it made you go because of

1024
01:07:35,439 --> 01:07:38,629
high schooler lower-grade student status

1025
01:07:38,629 --> 01:07:43,328
uh... so there was some interesting
tracking you for that limited uh...

1026
01:07:43,329 --> 01:07:44,159
arise

1027
01:07:44,159 --> 01:07:48,340
and uh... you know i'm pretty
libertarian i can understand that

1028
01:07:48,340 --> 01:07:49,859
if you don't want to be tracked

1029
01:07:49,859 --> 01:07:52,799
you know spend the money on uh...
full-fare card

1030
01:07:52,799 --> 01:07:55,809
so far as far as food for cards go

1031
01:07:55,809 --> 01:07:59,370
there is no provision for tracking in
individual records

1032
01:07:59,370 --> 01:08:04,549
or at a local unanimously transit
authority only accept cash let's run out

1033
01:08:04,550 --> 01:08:06,279
of this or not

1034
01:08:06,279 --> 01:08:10,640
there and brodeur known groups to go to
los angeles colored

1035
01:08:10,640 --> 01:08:11,930
in fact there is some

1036
01:08:11,930 --> 01:08:16,250
talking to you about your car was
originally proposed and introduced

1037
01:08:16,250 --> 01:08:20,060
now you have a good friends with the
card intrinsic to herself

1038
01:08:20,060 --> 01:08:21,539
so that if it was stolen

1039
01:08:21,538 --> 01:08:25,528
i could call it the central numbers say
higher on the russian armored car was

1040
01:08:25,529 --> 01:08:28,159
stolen stoppard refund my money

1041
01:08:28,158 --> 01:08:30,290
riverside dr going with that

1042
01:08:30,290 --> 01:08:31,319
uh...

1043
01:08:31,319 --> 01:08:36,549
was the first to go to a question

1044
01:08:36,549 --> 01:08:41,149
uh... you know as far as a close
uniqueness uh... as i stated before

1045
01:08:41,149 --> 01:08:44,858
there are three things that we know
around the card both printed and

1046
01:08:44,859 --> 01:08:46,880
probably on a very exciting

1047
01:08:46,880 --> 01:08:48,919
the expiration date

1048
01:08:48,919 --> 01:08:51,898
which is not unique to give him card
will be

1049
01:08:51,899 --> 01:08:55,250
one-third of all cards were four point
six whatever

1050
01:08:55,250 --> 01:08:58,769
many batch number which is unique to
every one hundred cards

1051
01:08:58,769 --> 01:09:04,339
and the serial number which it was
completely unique to that colored

1052
01:09:04,339 --> 01:09:11,209
on the island glasses

1053
01:09:11,209 --> 01:09:12,509
that that's uh...

1054
01:09:12,509 --> 01:09:14,719
that they cut me because of

1055
01:09:14,719 --> 01:09:16,880
because somebody on

1056
01:09:16,880 --> 01:09:20,989
because uh... undercover cop i got them
involved in the undoubtedly sting

1057
01:09:20,989 --> 01:09:24,529
operations and basically ah... was
interested person he was employee of

1058
01:09:24,529 --> 01:09:31,529
uh... ordered employees of someone else
and does there was a setup was drafted

1059
01:09:31,540 --> 01:09:32,328
zaroor

1060
01:09:32,328 --> 01:09:36,049
but i would be caught in this uh... this
thing about a computer saying something

1061
01:09:36,049 --> 01:09:39,139
about this other guy getting arrested
bestest uh...

1062
01:09:39,139 --> 01:09:42,949
but that's no job because i i think that
was just saying that just so uh...

1063
01:09:42,949 --> 01:09:44,999
promiscuous ryan

1064
01:09:44,999 --> 01:09:50,879
but i mean the way the way things are in
this town i know that i would find him

1065
01:09:50,879 --> 01:09:55,260
would not

1066
01:09:55,260 --> 01:09:58,809
are just like to have that i think
that's a pretty good attitude with rosa

1067
01:09:58,809 --> 01:10:01,929
transit authority appears to be paranoid

1068
01:10:01,929 --> 01:10:05,969
any other questions

1069
01:10:05,969 --> 01:10:09,300
forever

1070
01:10:09,300 --> 01:10:14,320
it was a report in the newspapers he was
arrested

1071
01:10:14,320 --> 01:10:19,959
somerset like i said uh... uh... in in
in the replied with a they have effort

1072
01:10:19,959 --> 01:10:20,809
today

1073
01:10:20,809 --> 01:10:21,780
but

1074
01:10:21,780 --> 01:10:25,230
as bill itself says i don't think the
comparison regular figure's probably

1075
01:10:25,230 --> 01:10:26,479
some cop just

1076
01:10:26,479 --> 01:10:30,550
hanger boaters tells voters they took so
i was part of it was a mastercard put

1077
01:10:30,550 --> 01:10:33,270
through uh... turn spelling dot for

1078
01:10:33,270 --> 01:10:36,480
entitle you to interject here this is
how

1079
01:10:36,480 --> 01:10:39,010
there's a lot of people that were of

1080
01:10:39,010 --> 01:10:42,599
uh... were arrested uh... previously
returned barton and the reason why they

1081
01:10:42,599 --> 01:10:45,550
were arrested schools are using your
regular cards using many

1082
01:10:45,550 --> 01:10:48,300
making up their own cards

1083
01:10:48,300 --> 01:10:50,659
just underway wiley

1084
01:10:50,659 --> 01:10:54,728
need people to the obvious thing if they
want if they want to defraud a transit

1085
01:10:54,729 --> 01:10:58,770
system use an actual card is beyond me

1086
01:10:58,770 --> 01:11:05,770
and this seems to me is a lot easier to
get the real thing

1087
01:11:06,579 --> 01:11:08,620
all those kind of thirty fourth street

1088
01:11:08,620 --> 01:11:10,250
yellow

1089
01:11:10,250 --> 01:11:14,219
off-handed sometime around march or
april

1090
01:11:14,219 --> 01:11:15,439
uh...

1091
01:11:15,439 --> 01:11:18,679
me if you want to do a search of true
articles uh...

1092
01:11:18,679 --> 01:11:22,500
the daily news and i definitely saw it
in the new york times might also be

1093
01:11:22,500 --> 01:11:29,500
uh... good source but that's really the
daily news here in new york

1094
01:11:45,590 --> 01:11:48,879
higher monthly visit personal program
this

1095
01:11:48,879 --> 01:11:50,699
i had a braves all

1096
01:11:50,699 --> 01:11:51,810
without

1097
01:11:51,810 --> 01:11:56,039
it would have some way of saying that it
actually did i detect the card

1098
01:11:56,039 --> 01:11:58,239
toward another head that would be a lot

1099
01:11:58,239 --> 01:12:00,849
trailing the one that was due in the
writing that would it would be a right

1100
01:12:00,849 --> 01:12:04,020
to get in there will be returned to
verify that actually happen with much

1101
01:12:04,020 --> 01:12:05,270
traffic through again

1102
01:12:05,270 --> 01:12:06,590
that's probably why

1103
01:12:06,590 --> 01:12:09,880
because what you're doing good another
turnstile she slept through it sorry

1104
01:12:09,880 --> 01:12:13,199
done with the new carpeting verify right

1105
01:12:13,199 --> 01:12:16,439
it is likely to again everything's fine
with another tristan sweated through

1106
01:12:16,439 --> 01:12:18,699
again misconduct again

1107
01:12:18,699 --> 01:12:25,699
yet again and verify rejected again and
that's why person's money

1108
01:12:26,270 --> 01:12:33,270
and i don't do any good

1109
01:12:42,139 --> 01:12:49,139
commander of the contract was a group of
several

1110
01:12:51,570 --> 01:12:58,570
pros who once worked hard to try to
resolve trying to do that

1111
01:13:02,629 --> 01:13:05,729
along i think the five-second delay is
the people who live safely through the

1112
01:13:05,729 --> 01:13:07,000
turnstile

1113
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:11,949
if you are right the metro for just jump
into anything

1114
01:13:11,949 --> 01:13:16,500
tony commentary about the lives of stuff
on turnstiles or other people but i was

1115
01:13:16,500 --> 01:13:19,889
just totally uh... unrelated but still
useful

1116
01:13:19,889 --> 01:13:21,149
uh...

1117
01:13:21,149 --> 01:13:25,320
on the new turnstiles if you put a total
diamond weight over thirty seconds

1118
01:13:25,320 --> 01:13:27,090
roberto clemente approach

1119
01:13:27,090 --> 01:13:30,769
so uh... all the graves of uh... we're
waiting for your train to come after

1120
01:13:30,769 --> 01:13:37,280
putting her attempted in argonne if you
put a token in broker

1121
01:13:37,280 --> 01:13:38,949
the way around we lose it

1122
01:13:38,949 --> 01:13:45,949
andrew a brown for goes back

1123
01:13:55,659 --> 01:13:57,349
karunakaran referee

1124
01:13:57,350 --> 01:14:04,350
and uh... where did the white house

1125
01:14:07,439 --> 01:14:08,580
come after me

1126
01:14:08,580 --> 01:14:09,679
uh...

1127
01:14:09,679 --> 01:14:12,719
left people here are packed the metro
card will

1128
01:14:12,719 --> 01:14:16,820
as i'm fond of saying the best hacked
isetan detected hacked

1129
01:14:16,820 --> 01:14:20,849
uh... those people become very happy and
say what of money

1130
01:14:20,850 --> 01:14:23,799
of if they decide to go public

1131
01:14:23,799 --> 01:14:27,899
uh... i think eventually the transit
authority the transit police will boost

1132
01:14:27,899 --> 01:14:30,909
another investigating

1133
01:14:30,909 --> 01:14:34,518
and that's where being a leader of
limited uh... helpfulness not that i

1134
01:14:34,519 --> 01:14:36,289
don't want to do more

1135
01:14:36,289 --> 01:14:41,629
refers to herself but ari white means
sleeping in a large room that amanda

1136
01:14:41,629 --> 01:14:43,590
twelve cell

1137
01:14:43,590 --> 01:14:47,899
of the question i have to put forward as
if they but it was a hacked the system

1138
01:14:47,899 --> 01:14:51,459
what they actually do it to save a
dollar twenty five provide isn't that

1139
01:14:51,459 --> 01:14:54,739
really really really cheap anyways

1140
01:14:54,739 --> 01:14:55,989
islets

1141
01:14:55,989 --> 01:14:57,670
i mean i i didn't idea

1142
01:14:57,670 --> 01:14:59,970
i didn't do anything with part because i
A

1143
01:14:59,970 --> 01:15:01,480
uh... why do you know

1144
01:15:01,480 --> 01:15:06,760
i well i i couldn't afford to ride part
i mean this is ridiculous

1145
01:15:06,760 --> 01:15:11,329
notes that still speculation

1146
01:15:11,329 --> 01:15:14,268
good luck if you go to our new york

1147
01:15:14,269 --> 01:15:18,939
flood ideal morale virtually there is
some talk of going over to israel wears

1148
01:15:18,939 --> 01:15:21,780
him to a racist who were very wary

1149
01:15:21,780 --> 01:15:26,329
matter according to the world less on
weekends blessed bites

1150
01:15:26,329 --> 01:15:31,190
but that's one of the royal tour for her
sixty ninth stations have got uh...

1151
01:15:31,190 --> 01:15:38,190
mentor corporate stores

1152
01:15:41,510 --> 01:15:46,899
promoter is under system there almost
certainly have to employ

1153
01:15:46,899 --> 01:15:51,429
if we go to a system whereby its client
which actually for new york isn't uh...

1154
01:15:51,429 --> 01:15:55,789
minority thing for anybody who has
access to the employees worldwide very

1155
01:15:55,789 --> 01:16:00,120
uh... wrote for over twenty years ago
when i was younger

1156
01:16:00,120 --> 01:16:01,530
we're going to a very badly

1157
01:16:01,530 --> 01:16:04,239
there are some book somewhere on the
subways which will tell you in the

1158
01:16:04,239 --> 01:16:05,869
twenties uh... the

1159
01:16:05,869 --> 01:16:09,339
the system or during rush hour or two
sets of turnstiles

1160
01:16:09,339 --> 01:16:11,889
anna clearer parks in those days would

1161
01:16:11,889 --> 01:16:13,840
turn them on before rush hour

1162
01:16:13,840 --> 01:16:16,739
one would take two pennies on the picket
nickel

1163
01:16:16,739 --> 01:16:19,040
and uh...

1164
01:16:19,040 --> 01:16:25,510
sarah brady overall pick an offbeat
pricing is not new

1165
01:16:25,510 --> 01:16:29,540
i was a very good idea from a measure
partly because it will encourage

1166
01:16:29,540 --> 01:16:32,949
eluru when that you might as well charge
for a little when it's not fall because

1167
01:16:32,949 --> 01:16:36,920
it will tend to fill it up anyways

1168
01:16:36,920 --> 01:16:41,499
but also ideally thing that i find it
very shocking after i live in europe for

1169
01:16:41,499 --> 01:16:43,050
number of years

1170
01:16:43,050 --> 01:16:46,789
is the fact that use turnstiles at all i
think that's a safety problem

1171
01:16:46,789 --> 01:16:51,580
you know he had his eye i see what i
like the corporate world to do so

1172
01:16:51,580 --> 01:16:54,929
i believe it should be reprogrammed
chartering the jury

1173
01:16:54,929 --> 01:16:58,000
though he did you buy a ticket when
certain time on it

1174
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:02,820
and uh... just entered the three cells
early for counting which usually the

1175
01:17:02,820 --> 01:17:07,269
police were put on a card aspiration
your ticket if you have a expired ticket

1176
01:17:07,270 --> 01:17:10,110
you have to pay for it on the spot or
the employee away

1177
01:17:10,110 --> 01:17:13,969
let your interest in israel's war in the
country united states or by return could

1178
01:17:13,969 --> 01:17:17,510
be stick in your party at right from the
turnstile

1179
01:17:17,510 --> 01:17:19,179
all

1180
01:17:19,179 --> 01:17:23,310
protruding numerous stories are told
jurors miles away if they do that

1181
01:17:23,310 --> 01:17:28,050
a lot of thing is that all pleasure ms
ghettoize before the both of us

1182
01:17:28,050 --> 01:17:33,030
jurors heard the regulars would be a
statement wake germans quebec and less

1183
01:17:33,030 --> 01:17:34,210
well it is

1184
01:17:34,210 --> 01:17:37,020
artists eight is that another german
term i've never seen it

1185
01:17:37,020 --> 01:17:41,570
all right but you're headed record and
are not alone

1186
01:17:41,570 --> 01:17:46,380
dot is saying is that allegedly european
you do well by the ticket and uh...

1187
01:17:46,380 --> 01:17:49,699
the ticket is worth you don't have to
show at leisure passport

1188
01:17:49,699 --> 01:17:54,040
except on certain buses you asked me to
get up front of the bus but

1189
01:17:54,040 --> 01:17:57,389
this is a different system of doing it
it's this kind of an honor system go to

1190
01:17:57,389 --> 01:18:00,089
our system that isn't forced me if you
are

1191
01:18:00,089 --> 01:18:02,110
kat breaking the code of honor the dead

1192
01:18:02,110 --> 01:18:03,860
you're fine

1193
01:18:03,860 --> 01:18:06,969
which is equivalent to about fifty
dollars or something

1194
01:18:06,969 --> 01:18:11,630
glorifying zero growth fairly heavy

1195
01:18:11,630 --> 01:18:18,630
any other questions from the white in
the middle

1196
01:18:48,280 --> 01:18:55,280
card

1197
01:18:56,830 --> 01:18:58,889
heil

1198
01:18:58,889 --> 01:19:05,889
heart

1199
01:19:07,619 --> 01:19:13,799
well this is the

1200
01:19:13,800 --> 01:19:15,969
since it was all sorts of artists

1201
01:19:15,969 --> 01:19:17,440
remarks on how to avoid

1202
01:19:17,440 --> 01:19:20,830
let's listen interesting thought but
uh... i'd like to carry out the

1203
01:19:20,830 --> 01:19:23,300
environment your cards that selma

1204
01:19:23,300 --> 01:19:27,860
newsstands and other outlets and like
tokens so far there's no restriction

1205
01:19:27,860 --> 01:19:34,860
that you have to use a metrocareer by it

1206
01:19:49,050 --> 01:19:56,050
who has a bachelors are tracked

1207
01:20:06,460 --> 01:20:13,460
everything else

1208
01:20:23,210 --> 01:20:27,969
as far as i know unlike tokens there is
no prohibition

1209
01:20:27,969 --> 01:20:33,790
but don't really believe holy roller
derby surprised if i was

1210
01:20:33,790 --> 01:20:38,169
there is a true disagree reinstalling
tokens for a third party that

1211
01:20:38,169 --> 01:20:41,169
notice alternatives to a third party

1212
01:20:41,169 --> 01:20:45,629
uh... which very interesting arrives
from back in a lot of sort of territory

1213
01:20:45,629 --> 01:20:49,349
utilities go everywhere

1214
01:20:49,349 --> 01:20:52,369
anything else

1215
01:20:52,369 --> 01:20:56,598
so sailors when you get something
institutional and in consideration for

1216
01:20:56,599 --> 01:21:03,249
something of value usually money

1217
01:21:03,249 --> 01:21:06,610
failures wrote about it like to thank
everybody

1218
01:21:06,610 --> 01:21:11,519
uh... if a lot more information about
the uh... handout that i wrote up

1219
01:21:11,520 --> 01:21:16,179
there and the you could hear concert
murder under a really cool to air india

1220
01:21:16,179 --> 01:21:16,439
too

1221
01:21:16,439 --> 01:21:19,030
they're the people that the
documentation for those

1222
01:21:19,030 --> 01:21:20,190
or manual

1223
01:21:20,190 --> 01:21:21,780
and they'll be able to get in touch with
me
