69
00:04:07,359 --> 00:04:11,750
the power into the 2600

70
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:16,358
panel this is %uh I guess kinda the
focal point of this whole thing our

71
00:04:16,358 --> 00:04:17,370
tenth anniversary

72
00:04:17,370 --> 00:04:20,599
it's kinda weird that we're here for 10
years I

73
00:04:20,599 --> 00:04:24,440
from the right to the left we have Scott
Skinner staff writer

74
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:28,410
and David Letterman told founder and

75
00:04:28,410 --> 00:04:34,289
then thank you then German are our
newest am

76
00:04:34,289 --> 00:04:38,320
on US that person and staff myself man
you don't stink

77
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:45,320
on school it's kind of embarrassing but

78
00:04:48,150 --> 00:04:51,220
why was a cofounder i Niesha Lee was
some

79
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:55,000
was on the people that really didn't
like the name 2600 just

80
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,210
I know it's only weird to me you know
sounded that's a numbered

81
00:04:58,210 --> 00:05:01,650
no incalls magazine by a number I want
something more

82
00:05:01,650 --> 00:05:06,449
my nothing like damn Merrick and
technological journal or something you

83
00:05:06,449 --> 00:05:06,849
know

84
00:05:06,849 --> 00:05:09,900
million when they've been call when
they've been nice american technology

85
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:10,720
could call the

86
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:13,830
a TJ something but then I'll

87
00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:17,139
Dave here is the one who had the idea
2600 and I'm

88
00:05:17,139 --> 00:05:23,199
think we all around a class that's

89
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:26,470
good many other ideas too on

90
00:05:26,470 --> 00:05:29,870
by 2600 the has gotten us

91
00:05:29,870 --> 00:05:32,960
in trouble quite a few times because
when you have a magazine that's a number

92
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:33,900
there's a lot of things that

93
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:39,539
you can't do the I'm II as many as you
know in all 2600 the

94
00:05:39,539 --> 00:05:43,270
Usenet site that's a a topic of
discussion the fact that you have a news

95
00:05:43,270 --> 00:05:44,919
group named after a number

96
00:05:44,919 --> 00:05:49,060
I every time we listed anywhere we're
always first because numbers come before

97
00:05:49,060 --> 00:05:50,380
letters and computers

98
00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:54,030
and %uh they've been all kinds about
bureaucratic foul-up some blunders

99
00:05:54,030 --> 00:05:55,200
because some

100
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:58,210
people on how to deal with numbers as
names I

101
00:05:58,210 --> 00:06:01,779
some I guess I want your body on the
panel chance to say what

102
00:06:01,779 --> 00:06:05,620
2600 as men to them over the years and I
we can take questions on

103
00:06:05,620 --> 00:06:09,680
have any source take suggestions
criticisms what have you

104
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:12,849
home start with Scott and blowing over

105
00:06:12,849 --> 00:06:16,770
the know we're gonna do this did

106
00:06:16,770 --> 00:06:20,270
myron

107
00:06:20,270 --> 00:06:23,460
yeah on I want me 600 means to me

108
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:26,669
stood that's the whole reason the most

109
00:06:26,669 --> 00:06:30,409
memorable moments I'm back on our our
press conference I think that was

110
00:06:30,409 --> 00:06:31,250
probably with the

111
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:34,840
yeah I think about that press conference
okay well

112
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:38,949
I'm we were for a time involved in this
story about syntex lacks never knows

113
00:06:38,949 --> 00:06:39,650
about that

114
00:06:39,650 --> 00:06:42,909
simplex and its legal termination

115
00:06:42,909 --> 00:06:46,979
anyone morning me alright my head

116
00:06:46,979 --> 00:06:50,699
54 to: but anyway what

117
00:06:50,699 --> 00:06:55,150
times with me dealing with real thats
federal express host sees me

118
00:06:55,150 --> 00:06:58,509
the rain

119
00:06:58,509 --> 00:07:02,259
lol we just came out at pretty good but
anyway

120
00:07:02,259 --> 00:07:06,659
I'm so involved in this story about
simplex locks and we thought this story

121
00:07:06,659 --> 00:07:07,110
was

122
00:07:07,110 --> 00:07:10,889
I'm probably important enough that we
should go like national weather and we

123
00:07:10,889 --> 00:07:14,159
should really make an effort to get it
tonight is on readers but everyone

124
00:07:14,159 --> 00:07:18,479
I'm his snow everyone uses federal
express is a major thing

125
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:21,688
so we we I had his press conference in
the city

126
00:07:21,689 --> 00:07:26,490
about the hotel and I'm we send out
faxes to every single

127
00:07:26,490 --> 00:07:30,270
I every single newspaper in your city

128
00:07:30,270 --> 00:07:33,359
everything a radio station every single
Journal

129
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:36,490
everything we could think I've around AP
wire service

130
00:07:36,490 --> 00:07:39,509
you know we we pretty much did
everything possible to like alert up

131
00:07:39,509 --> 00:07:42,960
everyone to our presence and then on the
day of the conference

132
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:46,409
and what we what we did was we found out
how this whole thing worked

133
00:07:46,409 --> 00:07:49,300
and the other conference we had this
multi-media display it much better than

134
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:50,279
this we had like

135
00:07:50,279 --> 00:07:53,649
you know I you know it slide projectors
and we had like

136
00:07:53,649 --> 00:07:56,930
demonstration locks in everything and no
one showed up

137
00:07:56,930 --> 00:08:00,289
and reason why was because there was a
water main break

138
00:08:00,289 --> 00:08:03,610
and really that's a precedent over every

139
00:08:03,610 --> 00:08:06,879
over any anything other half when I say
that with the personal one person that

140
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:10,649
show and mass murders me when I say to
people from Italian journalist some sort

141
00:08:10,649 --> 00:08:12,819
I don't know why they showed up in the
two pictures on this

142
00:08:12,819 --> 00:08:16,169
but the yeah there was a be water main
break

143
00:08:16,169 --> 00:08:19,409
that took care the local media but the
national media they were put off by a I

144
00:08:19,409 --> 00:08:21,550
think the biggest mass murder in texas
is highly

145
00:08:21,550 --> 00:08:24,649
so who pretty much on snowed under by
that

146
00:08:24,649 --> 00:08:28,999
time we tried but by its interestingly
and that's how we're to everyone for

147
00:08:28,999 --> 00:08:29,849
instance some

148
00:08:29,849 --> 00:08:33,789
when when a the mayor had their city he
was sad

149
00:08:33,789 --> 00:08:36,990
if you're afraid for the am the Rangers

150
00:08:36,990 --> 00:08:41,099
I you know he was hoping you know the
media to end what happened let's see now

151
00:08:41,099 --> 00:08:45,199
at the hotel thing happened and then he
i kno me SL apparently happens everyone

152
00:08:45,199 --> 00:08:49,709
you know when I can only once with him
so on has that the only reason americans

153
00:08:49,709 --> 00:08:53,329
are praying York City probably 3 NB
attention rains

154
00:08:53,329 --> 00:08:56,790
sure and and my sound that was
interesting

155
00:08:56,790 --> 00:09:01,160
still gun

156
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:04,209
it's just a lot more but I'm sure to
come back to

157
00:09:04,209 --> 00:09:08,640
murder got the other interesting thing
right about simpler slots was they were

158
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:10,839
trying to market them for your front
door

159
00:09:10,839 --> 00:09:14,910
your house the end the domestic version
right does anyone here have a simplex

160
00:09:14,910 --> 00:09:16,260
lock on their front door

161
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:19,779
and weekend yes michael Winship

162
00:09:19,779 --> 00:09:23,439
colleges and universities am all across
the united states are using this as the

163
00:09:23,439 --> 00:09:24,310
primary lock

164
00:09:24,310 --> 00:09:28,630
to protect students and I'm that was the
story I mean I was a major thing

165
00:09:28,630 --> 00:09:32,800
they were pushing it as a primary lock
system and which I never let people that

166
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:36,319
you know its was in securing it should
be used with my relaxing yeah this is a

167
00:09:36,319 --> 00:09:39,140
story that actually nothing to do with
computers but that we found the exact

168
00:09:39,140 --> 00:09:40,130
same

169
00:09:40,130 --> 00:09:43,660
ignorance abounding in the way people
dealt with this the way people running

170
00:09:43,660 --> 00:09:44,170
the

171
00:09:44,170 --> 00:09:48,339
I'm the actual ox say they would they
would have a default the

172
00:09:48,339 --> 00:09:52,279
password if you will and then they were
just not change it then

173
00:09:52,279 --> 00:09:55,589
and we were amazed when we found that
both federal express and UPS not only

174
00:09:55,589 --> 00:09:57,170
use the same termination

175
00:09:57,170 --> 00:10:00,370
around our area for the Dropbox but
these the same combination throughout

176
00:10:00,370 --> 00:10:01,459
the entire nation

177
00:10:01,459 --> 00:10:04,529
there's only three what three digits
long that's what security people's

178
00:10:04,529 --> 00:10:05,269
packages

179
00:10:05,269 --> 00:10:08,300
and idly to this day all the parts are
all the same

180
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:11,360
nothing has been a lot of them are allow
the money even even if they're not very

181
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:12,279
easy to get them

182
00:10:12,279 --> 00:10:15,760
I I know a lot of us have bad have
experimented with this

183
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:18,990
it they can be handy because people can
use

184
00:10:18,990 --> 00:10:22,079
federal express lock boxes as their own
private to

185
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:25,899
depositories at night as long as I get
there before 4:30 when a guy comes

186
00:10:25,899 --> 00:10:30,050
done but it's really not nice to change
the combination on the guy

187
00:10:30,050 --> 00:10:33,180
done and a sitting there for hours

188
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:37,029
then and then changing it back when he
comes back the next day with the

189
00:10:37,029 --> 00:10:37,800
supervisor

190
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:42,500
a but if there's a FedEx man at the
really hate

191
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:43,570
yeah

192
00:10:43,570 --> 00:10:46,630
the

193
00:10:46,630 --> 00:10:52,770
they vermin body 1 I'm

194
00:10:52,770 --> 00:10:56,800
had it all begins I was there in the
beginning

195
00:10:56,800 --> 00:11:02,810
back when 2600 look my best these are my
personal copies

196
00:11:02,810 --> 00:11:05,860
they're not

197
00:11:05,860 --> 00:11:09,460
color transparencies this but the

198
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:13,930
still UN photocopy lane at night

199
00:11:13,930 --> 00:11:17,020
sneaking into various places that board
paper

200
00:11:17,020 --> 00:11:20,550
then punching holes in mailing them out

201
00:11:20,550 --> 00:11:23,620
star really want to thank the up

202
00:11:23,620 --> 00:11:28,220
50 for subscribers who subscribe before
it came out

203
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:32,150
wherever they are do you even know who
their sure there's at least one or two

204
00:11:32,150 --> 00:11:32,850
in the room

205
00:11:32,850 --> 00:11:37,450
but some around 50 people subscribe
before the first issue came

206
00:11:37,450 --> 00:11:41,720
there we told him never to do that again
because that we we put out an ad various

207
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:44,500
newspapers saying ten ten dollars ashes
on bulletin boards

208
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:48,030
on this was before internet was really
happening

209
00:11:48,030 --> 00:11:51,780
and we just put up messages on a
bulletin board saying send ten dollars

210
00:11:51,780 --> 00:11:53,390
will send you a hacker magazine

211
00:11:53,390 --> 00:11:57,170
my people did done and so

212
00:11:57,170 --> 00:12:00,849
we we started off very small about I
think was a 25

213
00:12:00,850 --> 00:12:03,990
people first time yeah and I think so

214
00:12:03,990 --> 00:12:08,250
you know and we we went 2 a.m. II
distant post office

215
00:12:08,250 --> 00:12:11,770
late at night we we were sure we were
going to be arrested for doing what we

216
00:12:11,770 --> 00:12:12,380
were doing

217
00:12:12,380 --> 00:12:16,410
and we just drop these things in the in
the in the video a man

218
00:12:16,410 --> 00:12:21,810
they were kinda strange then I I guess
we we we figured that

219
00:12:21,810 --> 00:12:25,530
well course there is also a big national
indictment coming down in a couple of us

220
00:12:25,530 --> 00:12:26,810
so we're kinda paranoid

221
00:12:26,810 --> 00:12:31,080
about that at one point we were just we
we had a decision to make do we go ahead

222
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:32,760
with this or do we play it safe

223
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:36,430
and wellhead we were young and foolish
ok

224
00:12:36,430 --> 00:12:40,970
here we are and bar

225
00:12:40,970 --> 00:12:44,420
the ball I as an ad

226
00:12:44,420 --> 00:12:47,459
for this on when we first started

227
00:12:47,460 --> 00:12:50,990
why was around them course have only
been

228
00:12:50,990 --> 00:12:55,760
round for about six months or so I for
understanding

229
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:58,780
they would sneak into to an old

230
00:12:58,780 --> 00:13:04,260
older newspaper publishing newspaper
publishing building to typeset

231
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:07,339
and therefore from for

232
00:13:07,339 --> 00:13:11,400
ten years ago it was probably one of the
best looking zines zines around

233
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:14,850
in fact they remember from when

234
00:13:14,850 --> 00:13:18,650
may be 10 times I first met Cheshire and
he

235
00:13:18,650 --> 00:13:22,390
gave us such compliments on our
wonderful layout

236
00:13:22,390 --> 00:13:25,770
and if you compare it to anything easy
to dance

237
00:13:25,770 --> 00:13:30,170
not nothing too special but leaving
employment app early

238
00:13:30,170 --> 00:13:33,500
they put that on T

239
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:37,450
loll I haven't really been with them
with the magazine they're gone so

240
00:13:37,450 --> 00:13:40,770
I don't really know a whole lot of
history about it but I'm

241
00:13:40,770 --> 00:13:44,090
been amazed at what i've seen and even
in the six months there's been a lot of

242
00:13:44,090 --> 00:13:45,700
changes in a lot of progress so

243
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:49,270
I mean we're all here this at this
conference and its its to me it's

244
00:13:49,270 --> 00:13:50,360
amazing I don't know about

245
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:54,410
not all human i've seen this this whole
thing progress notes

246
00:13:54,410 --> 00:13:59,569
it's amazing to me the palms

247
00:13:59,570 --> 00:14:03,970
as Sun they've said them we first
started off it was he was kinda lot that

248
00:14:03,970 --> 00:14:04,420
we

249
00:14:04,420 --> 00:14:09,200
had access to a typesetting machine and
that's what made us look a little bit

250
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:10,340
better than

251
00:14:10,340 --> 00:14:14,500
you know other maybe dot matrix printed
zines are out there not that there's

252
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:17,860
anything wrong with that but that was
kinda cool to have this

253
00:14:17,860 --> 00:14:22,040
this professional look at not on that
one at one point we decided in may have

254
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:26,819
1985 made 1985 we we got independent we
decide to go 2 a.m.

255
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:30,140
what kinda printer was that a letter to
letter quality printer and look like

256
00:14:30,140 --> 00:14:30,819
shit

257
00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:34,350
is it lasted about two months at the
experiment

258
00:14:34,350 --> 00:14:39,910
who's the Diablo the other printer yes
so that that last a little while then

259
00:14:39,910 --> 00:14:41,329
went straight back to the typesetter

260
00:14:41,330 --> 00:14:44,780
them up it there was literally sneaking
in at night and

261
00:14:44,780 --> 00:14:48,490
the first time said we use you can only
type one line at a time

262
00:14:48,490 --> 00:14:51,790
I you tight if he had returned it was
printed name was it

263
00:14:51,790 --> 00:14:55,160
if you had any corrections yet to make
it the peace over it

264
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:58,650
and with really took a long time that's
why we're only six pages min

265
00:14:58,650 --> 00:15:02,790
took a lot of effort to put out then we
got into a better machine we had some

266
00:15:02,790 --> 00:15:03,709
memory but was still

267
00:15:03,710 --> 00:15:07,580
you had to deal with the pasting up and
smell the chemicals and things in

268
00:15:07,580 --> 00:15:10,930
and then we moved to desktop publishing
that's where we are now

269
00:15:10,930 --> 00:15:14,570
so well that's pretty much

270
00:15:14,570 --> 00:15:18,490
the history of 26 on any has been a lot
about a lotta we are things that happen

271
00:15:18,490 --> 00:15:20,390
to us over the years a lot of our

272
00:15:20,390 --> 00:15:24,449
threats from various companies and
agencies

273
00:15:24,450 --> 00:15:29,089
we visited once by the FBI who wanted to
recruit us to

274
00:15:29,089 --> 00:15:34,330
to get soviet people to see what obtain
high tech

275
00:15:34,330 --> 00:15:37,490
any legal manners I thought we'd be good
for that but

276
00:15:37,490 --> 00:15:42,250
we didn't in nine July 1987

277
00:15:42,250 --> 00:15:45,320
you were hit by lightning oh yeah direct
hit

278
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:48,790
I was something it again every
electronic anything that ran on

279
00:15:48,790 --> 00:15:50,620
electricity that Liam

280
00:15:50,620 --> 00:15:54,250
yeah it it pride or computers and
fortunately

281
00:15:54,250 --> 00:15:58,260
two months earlier we had gotten
computer insurance so we are save the

282
00:15:58,260 --> 00:16:01,660
real not don't know if I would have been
taken right out

283
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:04,850
arms and many other catastrophes

284
00:16:04,850 --> 00:16:09,000
I really we've erase things a few times
mean to but

285
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,830
well we arm back in the and rate right
after we

286
00:16:12,830 --> 00:16:17,420
we started we we had an official BBS
tried the private sector

287
00:16:17,420 --> 00:16:22,000
ran on an Apple to and after a few
months to

288
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,170
when he kinda hard drive yeah then made

289
00:16:25,170 --> 00:16:30,680
that we're really proud and and then
after a few more months it was seized by

290
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:32,459
the FBI on

291
00:16:32,459 --> 00:16:36,000
for now the secret service there is a
they were moving legs they're moving

292
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,630
satellites up in the heavens

293
00:16:37,630 --> 00:16:41,180
I was the quote now these people on a
bulletin board removing

294
00:16:41,180 --> 00:16:45,160
satellites and in fact we have we have a
tape that

295
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:48,430
we will play later in the weekend I love
a

296
00:16:48,430 --> 00:16:53,530
radio program Boston radio station where
they actually have commentary saying

297
00:16:53,530 --> 00:16:55,660
that that is back with these people were
doing in

298
00:16:55,660 --> 00:16:58,780
and AT&T everybody said this was
impossible

299
00:16:58,780 --> 00:17:02,069
teenagers could move satellites with
computers and just wasn't

300
00:17:02,070 --> 00:17:05,709
they were a could not be done so well
that was certainly a

301
00:17:05,709 --> 00:17:09,760
when the weirdest moments an event
eventually we got the stuff back six

302
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:10,819
months later but

303
00:17:10,819 --> 00:17:14,780
our system operate at the plead guilty
to owning a burglary tool which was a

304
00:17:14,780 --> 00:17:16,839
basic program that could emulate tones

305
00:17:16,839 --> 00:17:20,129
which we printed yeah we printed

306
00:17:20,130 --> 00:17:24,260
to we we usually print things that the
that people don't like

307
00:17:24,260 --> 00:17:27,300
reprinted form for the Atari and

308
00:17:27,300 --> 00:17:30,730
Commodore in the Hamptons so everybody
could be happy

309
00:17:30,730 --> 00:17:35,200
I more recently AT&T was upset with us
because the principle is to their

310
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:36,060
offices

311
00:17:36,060 --> 00:17:39,909
than solely dedicated the

312
00:17:39,910 --> 00:17:44,970
second part of it to them and printed a
letter to and recently this this is a

313
00:17:44,970 --> 00:17:46,160
good when a company

314
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:52,659
by served us with a cease and desist
order for printing

315
00:17:52,659 --> 00:17:56,220
such as far as that goes but we've had a
problem recently in that damn

316
00:17:56,220 --> 00:18:00,130
are well I wasn't really a problem but
it's kinda

317
00:18:00,130 --> 00:18:04,100
it's kind of an annoyance in some ways
the magazine is getting out there a lot

318
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:04,659
i mean

319
00:18:04,659 --> 00:18:08,610
you guys go over the final now Barnes
and Noble a tower

320
00:18:08,610 --> 00:18:12,190
and it's really it's it's kinda weird to
us because that's not what we were

321
00:18:12,190 --> 00:18:14,649
expecting are expecting this kind of
mass

322
00:18:14,649 --> 00:18:18,519
acceptance 2600 that rises on it was

323
00:18:18,519 --> 00:18:22,100
was form for very small group of people
at the beginning

324
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:25,169
and more people subscribe. then once we

325
00:18:25,169 --> 00:18:28,269
once we years

326
00:18:28,269 --> 00:18:33,630
once we hit newsstands it is kinda took
off in a lot of people that were curious

327
00:18:33,630 --> 00:18:35,169
about what hackers

328
00:18:35,169 --> 00:18:40,510
were doing read us and the courses were
at newsstands

329
00:18:40,510 --> 00:18:43,658
they don't have to worry about being on
listen many soared which

330
00:18:43,659 --> 00:18:46,870
I think a lot of people are worried
about it starts 2600

331
00:18:46,870 --> 00:18:50,519
because they don't take notice that the
cameras in the bookstores that record

332
00:18:50,519 --> 00:18:51,309
what you buy

333
00:18:51,309 --> 00:18:55,658
and for the scanners we do know that
doesn t

334
00:18:55,659 --> 00:18:59,980
mountains I don't know it's its kinda
strange problem

335
00:18:59,980 --> 00:19:04,149
because slobs who have to print a lot
more minutes and becomes a lot more

336
00:19:04,149 --> 00:19:04,659
about

337
00:19:04,659 --> 00:19:07,840
from project for an issue but

338
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:10,918
a lot of people read 2600 that

339
00:19:10,919 --> 00:19:15,440
one short cuts and what kinda concerned
with that cuz we want people to

340
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:18,139
understand what it is to be a hacker not
just

341
00:19:18,139 --> 00:19:23,049
what it is to make a free phone call
warranted to copy a credit card or two

342
00:19:23,049 --> 00:19:28,230
de Triana computer system I there's more
the hacking then just the end result is

343
00:19:28,230 --> 00:19:30,690
there's the whole journey that you go
through to get there

344
00:19:30,690 --> 00:19:34,000
and I'm we're just gonna concern that
that

345
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:38,279
people wanna get there without doing any
of the work and I think that's reflected

346
00:19:38,279 --> 00:19:39,090
a lot in a

347
00:19:39,090 --> 00:19:43,809
various discussions with and course
lover reaches lamesa losers discussion

348
00:19:43,809 --> 00:19:44,350
tomorrow

349
00:19:44,350 --> 00:19:47,529
can becoming the devil now a little bit
more I

350
00:19:47,529 --> 00:19:52,080
but thats it's really something we can't
do anything about me we don't wanna not

351
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:55,610
them provide the issues to people I so

352
00:19:55,610 --> 00:20:00,450
we we we can have follow what we're told
to do as far as the distributors go

353
00:20:00,450 --> 00:20:01,029
either

354
00:20:01,029 --> 00:20:04,110
we do try and I'm band

355
00:20:04,110 --> 00:20:07,940
keep it from becoming too commercialized
its kinda difficult sometimes because

356
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:10,080
it's great temptation held up in front
of us

357
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:14,600
I'll one national distributor wanted to
carry us and put us in virtually

358
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:19,029
every magazine store in the country and
hey I would've been great except down

359
00:20:19,029 --> 00:20:22,419
all over alternative distributors I got
us where we are now

360
00:20:22,419 --> 00:20:25,220
we've been screwed by that because they
would take over their accounts and they

361
00:20:25,220 --> 00:20:26,320
want to do all the work

362
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:30,210
so we'd rather do something as a as a
successful scene would like to do

363
00:20:30,210 --> 00:20:32,020
something for other reasons as well

364
00:20:32,020 --> 00:20:35,070
and there's a lot of them out there you
have to do is take a trip down the same

365
00:20:35,070 --> 00:20:35,399
art

366
00:20:35,399 --> 00:20:40,309
boxer tower or any those places and you
see there's been an explosion in desktop

367
00:20:40,309 --> 00:20:42,460
publishing in a magazine that all sorts

368
00:20:42,460 --> 00:20:45,659
and that's something that really has to
be supported and if we can

369
00:20:45,659 --> 00:20:48,710
how about distributors by allowing them
to distribute us

370
00:20:48,710 --> 00:20:51,799
that's good how about other things as
well and also getting people into

371
00:20:51,799 --> 00:20:53,730
bookstores to read these things

372
00:20:53,730 --> 00:20:57,669
you might pick up some other things out
there we'd really like to see other

373
00:20:57,669 --> 00:21:00,799
other hacker freaky related scenes as
well

374
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:03,940
I because it's a lot out there is a lot
we can get to

375
00:21:03,940 --> 00:21:08,789
on then about people that haven't
started writing yet we know you're out

376
00:21:08,789 --> 00:21:09,240
there

377
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:12,570
Solon I don't see why there is room for

378
00:21:12,570 --> 00:21:17,250
for many magazines like this very much
everything I have to say that magazine

379
00:21:17,250 --> 00:21:22,200
questions got the mic from and assets
and includes any

380
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:25,919
many questionable my question about the
covers I don't know they will be myself

381
00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:26,570
but that

382
00:21:26,570 --> 00:21:29,600
might see some do have been

383
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:32,750
sometimes the walk up to the microphone

384
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:36,980
yen one question any for actually a
serious question

385
00:21:36,980 --> 00:21:41,710
who exactly are all you guys cambodia
backgrounds and how did you get into

386
00:21:41,710 --> 00:21:42,779
this whole world

387
00:21:42,779 --> 00:21:44,350
and not really

388
00:21:44,350 --> 00:21:49,730
weekend again um less

389
00:21:49,730 --> 00:21:52,799
bombings be at be a question was I

390
00:21:52,799 --> 00:21:55,799
I always was on the impression that the
articles written by

391
00:21:55,799 --> 00:22:00,350
new were submitted but now I'm I L Weezy
and staff writers name know what you

392
00:22:00,350 --> 00:22:01,110
guys did

393
00:22:01,110 --> 00:22:06,210
and what you do do you do research to be
here and what you wanna radiation around

394
00:22:06,210 --> 00:22:07,230
in buying

395
00:22:07,230 --> 00:22:10,710
figure out what's going to be next issue
or has at all come about

396
00:22:10,710 --> 00:22:14,230
and also these a lot humor in your
magazine like abuse occurred when you

397
00:22:14,230 --> 00:22:14,950
have on your

398
00:22:14,950 --> 00:22:18,110
overhead its nutritional information
internally

399
00:22:18,110 --> 00:22:22,960
index who's the the brains behind all
humor and sarcasm in there

400
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:26,570
like I think from the Cunningham and you
said your about 100mm

401
00:22:26,570 --> 00:22:30,309
morn a leading branded you seem manual
me that

402
00:22:30,309 --> 00:22:34,389
the guy behind human but where did that
all come from in who does the cover art

403
00:22:34,390 --> 00:22:39,580
and we get your ideas worry where and
when yeah

404
00:22:39,580 --> 00:22:42,980
why I can answer yes I cast comes from
my dad did

405
00:22:42,980 --> 00:22:46,010
okay it's a well

406
00:22:46,010 --> 00:22:50,690
we're all pretty robert is like asking
people I I know what makes a sarcastic

407
00:22:50,690 --> 00:22:55,040
no arm utilization

408
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:59,540
yes um as far as background I'm an
English major

409
00:22:59,540 --> 00:23:04,050
I never to the computer course in my
life and I don't intend to need some

410
00:23:04,050 --> 00:23:07,580
I think

411
00:23:07,580 --> 00:23:10,929
you know there is no one to us because
we can't take all the fun out there

412
00:23:10,930 --> 00:23:14,160
you know you and someone to do something
you now have to do something

413
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:19,190
and I would hate computers much the
English now mine

414
00:23:19,190 --> 00:23:22,150
but being an English major I was able to
string a sentence together and that's

415
00:23:22,150 --> 00:23:23,110
not a good

416
00:23:23,110 --> 00:23:27,850
on and what we what we all do is
basically

417
00:23:27,850 --> 00:23:30,940
then we don't all the wood anymore I

418
00:23:30,940 --> 00:23:34,710
all the time anyway with other people
that aren't here arm

419
00:23:34,710 --> 00:23:37,789
we basically reach decisions as to what
to run

420
00:23:37,789 --> 00:23:41,620
how to run it what it looks like what
should be edited what should be

421
00:23:41,620 --> 00:23:45,160
not putting it all I where the magazine
is going

422
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:48,710
what goes on what pages are kinda
different things am and we

423
00:23:48,710 --> 00:23:51,850
right house articles is what we call
them occasionally to

424
00:23:51,850 --> 00:23:55,799
but by far must've articles come from

425
00:23:55,799 --> 00:23:58,990
people all over the world that said it
was the email faxes

426
00:23:58,990 --> 00:24:02,270
I'll literally reading in our answering
machines and

427
00:24:02,270 --> 00:24:06,350
bob dunne then maybe should tell people
how they can senator nickles in

428
00:24:06,350 --> 00:24:09,880
yeah oh well we can I guess we can't do
that addresses and stuff

429
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:13,760
on people mailed to us and email what
other things like that

430
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:17,289
yes we're talking to your now

431
00:24:17,289 --> 00:24:21,679
that talk about the organization because

432
00:24:21,679 --> 00:24:26,130
may allow people especially mine force
meant a very interested in

433
00:24:26,130 --> 00:24:29,620
I'm whether this is a conspiracy or you
know what's going on here

434
00:24:29,620 --> 00:24:33,370
and I'm it's strange there is no
organization

435
00:24:33,370 --> 00:24:36,440
opinion the best way I can describe it
as a psych

436
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:41,039
is my main st. banality Vista Social
Club thats all there are a ton

437
00:24:41,039 --> 00:24:45,340
if I could do that doesn't require never
garrick rain and then you have like

438
00:24:45,340 --> 00:24:48,879
make a couple people who are around here
call the time so they're gonna do

439
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:49,840
contribute more

440
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:52,860
and then around that are more people and
more people on what it is like we all

441
00:24:52,860 --> 00:24:54,710
have our own lives are doing independent
things

442
00:24:54,710 --> 00:24:57,870
but every once in a lower our this
drawing together for something like this

443
00:24:57,870 --> 00:24:58,669
for instance

444
00:24:58,669 --> 00:25:03,030
and we produce something by Beth and
that's how it's produced

445
00:25:03,030 --> 00:25:07,280
age there's there's no organization me
probably our biggest gripes I know what

446
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:07,770
they are

447
00:25:07,770 --> 00:25:11,470
he send us money for subscriptions and
you don't get your first issue for white

448
00:25:11,470 --> 00:25:12,100
six months

449
00:25:12,100 --> 00:25:15,100
I and you're like me you know typical
day at the office

450
00:25:15,100 --> 00:25:18,360
this person is complaining because they
have received an issue as persons

451
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:20,640
complaining they have any serious you
lawsuit lasted

452
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:24,159
its presence in playing now that's
typical day and the reason why is

453
00:25:24,159 --> 00:25:24,820
because

454
00:25:24,820 --> 00:25:28,760
you know we're not were publishers but
where hackers till we're actually out

455
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:29,850
there doing things

456
00:25:29,850 --> 00:25:33,450
when you have time to do paperwork and I
get the issue and all this other stuff

457
00:25:33,450 --> 00:25:37,159
so we can on volunteers and bouncers you
now they come in they go

458
00:25:37,159 --> 00:25:40,299
so I'm that's why I dislike the
organization is very

459
00:25:40,299 --> 00:25:43,379
bad news by Tom by large

460
00:25:43,380 --> 00:25:46,690
that's one of the reasons that this
conference we've got the

461
00:25:46,690 --> 00:25:49,980
three Dutch people for germans in the
house now that our that are

462
00:25:49,980 --> 00:25:52,960
stuffing envelopes and men doing all
kinds of things for us know pay its

463
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:53,419
great

464
00:25:53,419 --> 00:25:58,330
I'm hun now seriously I we your
neighbors G

465
00:25:58,330 --> 00:26:03,580
yes it is lindon we suck at returning
phone calls I'm sure most no no

466
00:26:03,580 --> 00:26:06,949
little better with the email I but not
much

467
00:26:06,950 --> 00:26:10,480
and administratively is a disaster but

468
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:14,850
we we we try to a magazine so we try to
do and I don't think we've ever

469
00:26:14,850 --> 00:26:21,850
not the fill the subscription it takes a
while sometimes

470
00:26:22,059 --> 00:26:26,678
I'll cover art we have several artists
I'm occurring artist is

471
00:26:26,679 --> 00:26:30,030
Holly Commons program something would be
here today but I don't think he is

472
00:26:30,030 --> 00:26:34,780
and I'm basically we describe what we
want to her and she does it

473
00:26:34,780 --> 00:26:38,300
and oftentimes she adds things that mean
everything to that in which

474
00:26:38,300 --> 00:26:41,870
are a perfect and you know we have we
have them all here

475
00:26:41,870 --> 00:26:45,070
reefer went to Kinkos in we r

476
00:26:45,070 --> 00:26:48,120
got transparencies all our recover so if
there's anything

477
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:51,330
people don't understand is all all very
crystal-clear

478
00:26:51,330 --> 00:26:54,399
on we try to make it is

479
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:58,559
you know nice as possible how many
subscriptions have been marked by the

480
00:26:58,559 --> 00:26:59,620
United States government

481
00:26:59,620 --> 00:27:05,120
well you'd be surprised who subscribes
to us we can really easy and we have to

482
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:07,990
respect their privacy term we have to
respect privacy but

483
00:27:07,990 --> 00:27:12,530
line

484
00:27:12,530 --> 00:27:18,230
promises which is we have in total its
it's been around the 2022 hundred mark

485
00:27:18,230 --> 00:27:19,200
for years

486
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:23,280
its level of it that but them but
newsstands Owen has

487
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:27,760
has gone through the roof I well it
seems

488
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:31,210
several years ago we had maybe I'm that
same

489
00:27:31,210 --> 00:27:34,720
five years ago we probably were equal on
newsstands and I'm

490
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:40,480
and subscriptions and now it's about ten
times the amount at Houston's

491
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:44,809
and that's that's really the its you can
shock says it kinda scares us because we

492
00:27:44,809 --> 00:27:46,000
wanted these things out

493
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:49,179
and I'm and everybody

494
00:27:49,179 --> 00:27:53,130
reason you know it's it's it's kinda
weird really weren't expecting this to

495
00:27:53,130 --> 00:27:54,790
happen we started in some mean

496
00:27:54,790 --> 00:27:59,428
my it just kinda strange me how many
people came here because they read about

497
00:27:59,429 --> 00:28:02,980
it in 2609 or the reasons

498
00:28:02,980 --> 00:28:06,410
I it's thats yeah a lot as a wave
reaching people

499
00:28:06,410 --> 00:28:10,390
I and this is like the other ways the
region people now we have a radio show

500
00:28:10,390 --> 00:28:11,920
here in New York City which

501
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:15,050
called of the house once a week and

502
00:28:15,050 --> 00:28:21,409
taken its kinda cool to be able to be
there in a fifty thousand dollar radio

503
00:28:21,410 --> 00:28:24,960
station right smack in the middle the FM
dial you know New York City I mean

504
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:28,920
bad I can't get any better than that but
we talk about hacker issues we talk

505
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:30,190
about things that the

506
00:28:30,190 --> 00:28:35,120
that affect all of us and its size
something that I don't think we could

507
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:38,460
have done ten years ago ten years ago
hackers existed but the

508
00:28:38,460 --> 00:28:42,880
they were rather scarce as far as

509
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:46,340
finding anything positive to say about
in the media I

510
00:28:46,340 --> 00:28:51,150
the same kinda holds true these days but
I think we have a better chance I think

511
00:28:51,150 --> 00:28:52,640
more people are getting it

512
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:56,500
I sure hope this conference is is living
proof that because I'm

513
00:28:56,500 --> 00:29:00,000
here I may be so the news crews are here
today are quite a few of them

514
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:03,470
well they don't have anything negative
to say about us today I mean what can I

515
00:29:03,470 --> 00:29:04,030
say

516
00:29:04,030 --> 00:29:07,990
we're here showing people you know the
Internet teaching seminars on various

517
00:29:07,990 --> 00:29:11,010
issues privacy issues and things like
that

518
00:29:11,010 --> 00:29:13,890
we're not being arrested were not been
charged with all kinds of crimes and

519
00:29:13,890 --> 00:29:14,550
that's really

520
00:29:14,550 --> 00:29:18,918
what the only thing we were really given
press for ten years ago so

521
00:29:18,919 --> 00:29:22,260
I like to think we're making progress I
know I know some people think I'm a

522
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:24,080
foolish optimist but that

523
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:27,290
I think we have to try I think we have
to try to get the message on

524
00:29:27,290 --> 00:29:30,290
just keep not me alone

525
00:29:30,290 --> 00:29:33,830
new welcome to my cuz people back to
give your name how long have you been

526
00:29:33,830 --> 00:29:34,820
sending a

527
00:29:34,820 --> 00:29:39,320
to new stand to receive these by Julie
we we don't sit in the stands overseas

528
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:40,840
but our distributors do

529
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:45,580
mike got our records for instance are
actually Tower books is the subsidiary

530
00:29:45,580 --> 00:29:49,399
may send the tower records in London and
various other parts and the

531
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:53,130
Europe and I think asia to and that's
how we get over there

532
00:29:53,130 --> 00:29:56,540
I we don't know where it's all people
call us and say where can i buy

533
00:29:56,540 --> 00:30:00,360
his magazine in Minneapolis we don't
know we send how ever many copies or

534
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:02,200
distributors we have quite a few without
was

535
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:06,320
and then they somehow get them out to
these these places is necessary places

536
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:10,178
it's great to find a magazine when you
cross country somewhere in

537
00:30:10,179 --> 00:30:13,450
in some strange small-town easy 2600

538
00:30:13,450 --> 00:30:17,480
I but we don't know how I guess there we
don't know where exactly it is

539
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:21,270
miss bpm

540
00:30:21,270 --> 00:30:24,530

542
00:30:28,169 --> 00:30:31,480
when you're done when you write

543
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:35,050
your are this first member seen 2600

544
00:30:35,050 --> 00:30:38,418
heard about it on the net and I'm a
newbie I don't know anything

545
00:30:38,419 --> 00:30:41,620
immune XP and get and one home

546
00:30:41,620 --> 00:30:45,150
an even-handed anything good on TV but
while ago

547
00:30:45,150 --> 00:30:49,880
yeah in any own when think you like

548
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:53,650
put like a big dummies arm and glossary

549
00:30:53,650 --> 00:30:58,929
in your magazine for the jargon and the
an act and the acronyms that you

550
00:30:58,929 --> 00:31:02,530
having your text what that's that's a
good question a lot of people ask us

551
00:31:02,530 --> 00:31:03,290
that

552
00:31:03,290 --> 00:31:07,370
to to have sort of a review we want to
do something like that I really do

553
00:31:07,370 --> 00:31:10,760
however at the same time we don't want
to the

554
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:14,220
for for our readers who already have
reached that point we don't want to

555
00:31:14,220 --> 00:31:18,159
regress designs would have to be
something something separate from the

556
00:31:18,159 --> 00:31:22,580
magazine it may be a guy have some sort
born 09 December time but you for each

557
00:31:22,580 --> 00:31:24,189
issue just a little box

558
00:31:24,190 --> 00:31:28,240
YUM like a good I an appendix cross
street

559
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:31,630
to the acronyms that occur in the
articles

560
00:31:31,630 --> 00:31:34,760
also if you could do a big damage 2600

561
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:37,830
for newbies so that they do get the
feeling when a hacker is you know the

562
00:31:37,830 --> 00:31:40,149
long sendo the lungs n path

563
00:31:40,150 --> 00:31:43,710
to arm as the Sabres separatism so

564
00:31:43,710 --> 00:31:46,780
or whatever to cyber shamballa um point
being

565
00:31:46,780 --> 00:31:50,580
see my looking forward home i dnt

566
00:31:50,580 --> 00:31:54,158
should buy back issues arm does still
there

567
00:31:54,159 --> 00:31:57,960
they still have acronyms Anna it's not
on baby sleeping

568
00:31:57,960 --> 00:32:01,650
third question I have a view is home

569
00:32:01,650 --> 00:32:04,650
Pro Tahiti pensions patients

570
00:32:04,650 --> 00:32:08,840
competitions if you want to do something
for the jeans

571
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:12,680
and the struggling distribution on

572
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:15,670
learn armed

573
00:32:15,670 --> 00:32:18,680
moms you might consider my

574
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:21,890
taking advertisements and setting up a

575
00:32:21,890 --> 00:32:26,110
chant pond like working assets it sets
up a

576
00:32:26,110 --> 00:32:31,100
telephone long distance company but it
also Hannah Mitchell fun but it also has

577
00:32:31,100 --> 00:32:34,740
committee home snapple be pushing
suggesting we set up a phone company

578
00:32:34,740 --> 00:32:41,740
yeah guy

579
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:46,130
got have trouble reading goodnight

580
00:32:46,130 --> 00:32:49,590
money and you can't use it to support um

581
00:32:49,590 --> 00:32:54,680
seems and struggling artists and um in
novel ways of getting information out

582
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:58,340
because it does checkbooks like the guy
on and become one

583
00:32:58,340 --> 00:33:01,930
working assets is doing and ship which
was just originally wanted to find a

584
00:33:01,930 --> 00:33:03,000
means to help

585
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:07,700
a progressive causes me so there are
alternatives but I think

586
00:33:07,700 --> 00:33:10,840
in the face overweening popularity

587
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:14,180
you might consider Shumway she set up

588
00:33:14,180 --> 00:33:19,000
0 hot in which to be on just making it
available to small distributors

589
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:22,770
I look hot or something to spread the
gold and the cheer

590
00:33:22,770 --> 00:33:26,190
anon make seems available I was running

591
00:33:26,190 --> 00:33:29,690
well well well will try to think that
you're going to be good

592
00:33:29,690 --> 00:33:33,980
we do that in a sense for instance baby
neighbor subscribers

593
00:33:33,980 --> 00:33:37,960
can run an ad in both important back
magazine we have areas for that

594
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:41,810
and I think the idea there be no
advertisements I like the philosophy

595
00:33:41,810 --> 00:33:42,899
behind that any american

596
00:33:42,900 --> 00:33:46,810
explain it to you by and it to safeguard
against certain dangers which I'm sure

597
00:33:46,810 --> 00:33:47,840
other way round

598
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:51,480
and because like any like any structural
engineering station you know

599
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:54,530
their dangers and we can we can lose
focus on what we're trying to do

600
00:33:54,530 --> 00:33:59,200
we're under a lot of pressure from
people to take advertising not we get

601
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:00,910
hounded all times 100

602
00:34:00,910 --> 00:34:05,110
the franchise 2600 where in an attack on
a bun

603
00:34:05,110 --> 00:34:08,200
when I i'm saying services I'm saying
warned to

604
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:12,060
like to write scenes struggling team
since i won

605
00:34:12,060 --> 00:34:16,250
immunizations but he's even we're kinda
we can as

606
00:34:16,250 --> 00:34:19,760
we got kind of a single purpose in our
in our in our minds and that's that has

607
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:22,280
put out a hacker Zenon

608
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:27,020
and I'm know we try to do that you know
good-hearted things when we can

609
00:34:27,020 --> 00:34:30,530
budget done to ensure living beyond your

610
00:34:30,530 --> 00:34:33,730
more mines lysine concept and such

611
00:34:33,730 --> 00:34:39,520
I mean institutionally Parliament do we
plan on living a long time

612
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:43,030
11 or dead on most if you will be too

613
00:34:43,030 --> 00:34:49,390
and I done and my children will demand
that we probably won't last that long

614
00:34:49,389 --> 00:34:50,089
anyway the

615
00:34:50,090 --> 00:34:53,700
I mean I don't I'm once it's done and
once it's

616
00:34:53,700 --> 00:34:58,410
it's gone out so far that other people
taken over another other zines love made

617
00:34:58,410 --> 00:34:59,879
it and others involved

618
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:03,040
love book prospered and and hopefully
they'll be

619
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:07,100
competition Sunday we won in and and we
we we

620
00:35:07,100 --> 00:35:10,529
am start something you want it started
we did in

621
00:35:10,530 --> 00:35:13,580
and look what we look where we are been
you know that there never seems to be a

622
00:35:13,580 --> 00:35:15,730
shortage a 15-year-old

623
00:35:15,730 --> 00:35:20,060
look

624
00:35:20,060 --> 00:35:23,160
against against a man charged
fifteen-year-olds no Ivan

625
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:27,029
question regarding content your corner
leanna

626
00:35:27,030 --> 00:35:30,690
a real I somewhere in the longer than
others common in your articles ranged

627
00:35:30,690 --> 00:35:31,400
from kinda

628
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:35,150
content-rich cold front device has a
title

629
00:35:35,150 --> 00:35:38,240
not to have packing how interesting

630
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:41,780
sino it's too there is one I recall
particular one aggravating me

631
00:35:41,780 --> 00:35:46,130
how was the a hacking high school which
was so completely in any

632
00:35:46,130 --> 00:35:51,690
and continent 3 a as his to be useful to
assist with any human bodies or

633
00:35:51,690 --> 00:35:56,460
we was really fun I remember the article
in question that hacking high school

634
00:35:56,460 --> 00:35:59,020
article lead to I think three other
hacking high school articles and people

635
00:35:59,020 --> 00:36:00,300
I thought they could do it better

636
00:36:00,300 --> 00:36:04,180
what the times we we we print things and
we we tryin to

637
00:36:04,180 --> 00:36:07,669
didn't spend too much space on these
kind of things

638
00:36:07,670 --> 00:36:11,440
we print things which may not be 100
percent accurate but they will start

639
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:12,450
discussion

640
00:36:12,450 --> 00:36:16,020
they'll start the polls saying no this
is this is not quite the way you do it

641
00:36:16,020 --> 00:36:17,160
you do it this way

642
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:21,100
and what we have is we have maybe three
or four different people participating

643
00:36:21,100 --> 00:36:23,799
in the process that we have that
discussion going in the end

644
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:28,240
for lucky we'll have the fax straight on
because we can check

645
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:31,710
everything we can check all the facts as
far as I'm

646
00:36:31,710 --> 00:36:35,980
as as what will work on this particular
type a system is very complicated

647
00:36:35,980 --> 00:36:40,410
and even the most brilliant minds we
know I'll get things wrong

648
00:36:40,410 --> 00:36:43,940
they make mistakes we've had all kinds
of mistakes that that that

649
00:36:43,940 --> 00:36:48,100
are our best writers have made and
summer are pretty funny but

650
00:36:48,100 --> 00:36:52,900
them that but some it's something that i
think is is important that

651
00:36:52,900 --> 00:36:56,060
we've we've kinda like a hacker's digest

652
00:36:56,060 --> 00:36:59,580
you know like a reader's digest
everything we know

653
00:36:59,580 --> 00:37:03,690
say that this is our view for every
single article we print we don't say

654
00:37:03,690 --> 00:37:05,310
it's 100 percent correct

655
00:37:05,310 --> 00:37:08,650
this is what the hackers are saying near
the hackers your writing for us

656
00:37:08,650 --> 00:37:12,630
miss ending things in your contributing
to this and we're just gonna tying it

657
00:37:12,630 --> 00:37:13,410
all up and

658
00:37:13,410 --> 00:37:16,750
and china doll gun

659
00:37:16,750 --> 00:37:21,740
is there a good story behind why you a
noun barcode on the front nine

660
00:37:21,740 --> 00:37:24,940
well one wanna borrow 14

661
00:37:24,940 --> 00:37:27,960
alternate distributors actually suggest
that to us

662
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:31,170
they said that if we had a bar code
there

663
00:37:31,170 --> 00:37:35,660
make their lives easier and we figured
you know we have fun with the park on

664
00:37:35,660 --> 00:37:39,609
songs you know that we have a guy
standing on the market this none

665
00:37:39,610 --> 00:37:43,370
we had somebody dumping trash into the
we

666
00:37:43,370 --> 00:37:46,589
like the last time we actually had a
bargain are

667
00:37:46,590 --> 00:37:49,710
many years ago done yes

668
00:37:49,710 --> 00:37:56,410
unit is government mine

669
00:37:56,410 --> 00:38:03,109
think a second one

670
00:38:03,109 --> 00:38:06,420
than anybody scan man's

671
00:38:06,420 --> 00:38:12,539
I'll come on nobody no one person but
nobody went to a store in skin at c-1

672
00:38:12,539 --> 00:38:15,660
good why should we tell you %um finally

673
00:38:15,660 --> 00:38:19,589
no effort no answer alright a hub

674
00:38:19,589 --> 00:38:22,880
midnight now want a quickie the answer
is it gerry has no other

675
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:27,809
be museums and strip with chairs
turbines

676
00:38:27,809 --> 00:38:33,190
but he was cherry pop tarts my lovin
strawberry not sure on

677
00:38:33,190 --> 00:38:36,239
okay 90 once-secret down

678
00:38:36,239 --> 00:38:39,529
that's when you're done with that 23 now
was in 20's

679
00:38:39,529 --> 00:38:44,950
now we discuss that in the US family
arms

680
00:38:44,950 --> 00:38:48,160
actually trying to get a barcode bangs

681
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:52,220
years ago be but there is too much
people were here we were ready for them

682
00:38:52,220 --> 00:38:55,400
but that is our market now we learned a
lot about that we have a little

683
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:59,549
transparency we have to include the
cover every single issue and I'm

684
00:38:59,549 --> 00:39:04,489
what was not on that one I but the
changes with every issue

685
00:39:04,489 --> 00:39:07,720
as a you know wanted two or three or
four depending on

686
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:11,049
what I meant them about the year it is
and you can see that every single

687
00:39:11,049 --> 00:39:12,079
magazine out there

688
00:39:12,079 --> 00:39:16,739
so parkas a kind Chronicle 9

689
00:39:16,739 --> 00:39:20,109
unknown often wondered about the money
vision 9

690
00:39:20,109 --> 00:39:23,119
reading 2601 Jenna

691
00:39:23,119 --> 00:39:28,989
some additional information prompted 9

692
00:39:28,989 --> 00:39:32,109
wellhead one going on mom

693
00:39:32,109 --> 00:39:35,308
their are more than a thousand people at
this conference and

694
00:39:35,309 --> 00:39:38,819
I think that's pretty much sums it up
the week were out to get people

695
00:39:38,819 --> 00:39:41,880
together and have discussions in Spring
information in

696
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:46,289
think it's working it's a good feeling
when we put something out

697
00:39:46,289 --> 00:39:50,069
and people like it people right in and
say hey that was good

698
00:39:50,069 --> 00:39:53,369
always makes makes actual changes in in
I

699
00:39:53,369 --> 00:39:58,109
in ways things happen on people's lives
people say wow I read this article and I

700
00:39:58,109 --> 00:39:59,009
showed it to my sis

701
00:39:59,009 --> 00:40:02,660
my school administrator and I got kicked
outta school time

702
00:40:02,660 --> 00:40:06,649
like anything really makes you realize
that writing is a powerful tool you can

703
00:40:06,650 --> 00:40:08,239
they can move people again

704
00:40:08,239 --> 00:40:12,499
we can change things and I think we've
gotten a lot of people to write

705
00:40:12,499 --> 00:40:15,910
that would not be riding ordinarily and
and thinking

706
00:40:15,910 --> 00:40:20,489
in very interesting ways thinking about
ways in challenging authority

707
00:40:20,489 --> 00:40:23,549
which is a very positive thing to do I
think I

708
00:40:23,549 --> 00:40:26,730
if you know why you're doing it and if
you if you believe

709
00:40:26,730 --> 00:40:30,119
that you're writing what you doing com

710
00:40:30,119 --> 00:40:33,259
and just trying to find what the hacker
view is

711
00:40:33,259 --> 00:40:36,630
who hackers are why we're here with what
we're trying to accomplish

712
00:40:36,630 --> 00:40:39,819
and the never-ending task

713
00:40:39,819 --> 00:40:43,819
correcting those people I keep getting
it wrong you know movement we we have to

714
00:40:43,819 --> 00:40:46,980
I i cant a number of times I've had to
deal with the house analogy you know the

715
00:40:46,980 --> 00:40:48,749
house now she is right

716
00:40:48,749 --> 00:40:53,329
no 11 someone breaking into my house a
so how did you break into my computer

717
00:40:53,329 --> 00:40:53,880
while

718
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:57,920
course you don't break into your
computer we usually break into

719
00:40:57,920 --> 00:41:01,960
be huge computers and universities and
the corporations and things like that

720
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:05,249
so against as long discourse about how
it's more like an of

721
00:41:05,249 --> 00:41:09,809
office building the filing cabinets out
by the curb but it never really gets

722
00:41:09,809 --> 00:41:10,670
anywhere in mind

723
00:41:10,670 --> 00:41:14,019
wonderful frustrated saddam

724
00:41:14,019 --> 00:41:16,320
you're a good one

725
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:19,410
the money

726
00:41:19,410 --> 00:41:20,060
30

727
00:41:20,060 --> 00:41:23,160
home small assuming that fund was never
sent my clock yes you're right

728
00:41:23,160 --> 00:41:28,049
done

729
00:41:28,050 --> 00:41:31,380
may have read your story in Ventnor been
named Jerome

730
00:41:31,380 --> 00:41:35,230
fiber to pennsylvanians and now I'm
really wondering

731
00:41:35,230 --> 00:41:40,330
I know you friends with him has he doing
now and are you guys in any danger and

732
00:41:40,330 --> 00:41:41,400
you feel as if

733
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:44,410
then you should stop doing this because

734
00:41:44,410 --> 00:41:47,560
okay to update people fiberoptic is

735
00:41:47,560 --> 00:41:52,430
is one of our writers his a terrific
person is a great hacker

736
00:41:52,430 --> 00:41:57,169
I should be here you really should then
tomorrow we will hear a message from him

737
00:41:57,170 --> 00:42:00,190
you may be able to get through to us
somehow I love the

738
00:42:00,190 --> 00:42:03,380
the phone system in his presence of
fucked up right now

739
00:42:03,380 --> 00:42:07,100
did not know that they won't allow any
calls to go through

740
00:42:07,100 --> 00:42:11,240
I can only call collect a certain
numbers and blue not the phone company

741
00:42:11,240 --> 00:42:12,230
out there is called lock

742
00:42:12,230 --> 00:42:16,340
tell mission listens salt rub into the
womb

743
00:42:16,340 --> 00:42:20,890
I'm but he's he's currently in prison
until November

744
00:42:20,890 --> 00:42:26,670
and its that somehow the sobering
experience because

745
00:42:26,670 --> 00:42:29,700
yeah a year ago we did not think that
that they would actually send someone

746
00:42:29,700 --> 00:42:31,930
like him to prison is a hacker that that

747
00:42:31,930 --> 00:42:35,480
that everybody said didn't do anything
malicious he simply

748
00:42:35,480 --> 00:42:38,810
taught people how to do things he spread
information around

749
00:42:38,810 --> 00:42:42,170
yeah there are religious people and and
they should be punished in various ways

750
00:42:42,170 --> 00:42:45,690
no one is ever really argued about that
by here is a case of somebody who

751
00:42:45,690 --> 00:42:46,710
clearly was not

752
00:42:46,710 --> 00:42:50,930
and they sent to prison for a year and a
day to prove a point and the judge said

753
00:42:50,930 --> 00:42:52,490
this he said that

754
00:42:52,490 --> 00:42:57,150
you acted as a symbol I he appeared on
The WB I radio program he

755
00:42:57,150 --> 00:43:01,050
answered call those questions he was on
television he was at conferences like

756
00:43:01,050 --> 00:43:01,730
this

757
00:43:01,730 --> 00:43:04,940
you ask you something he tell you that's
that's how he was

758
00:43:04,940 --> 00:43:08,300
and the judge called him a simple
because then he said the at the

759
00:43:08,300 --> 00:43:08,960
sentences

760
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:12,240
him as a symbol I and so are are

761
00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:15,480
symbols in prison now I until November

762
00:43:15,480 --> 00:43:20,440
and sucks I yeah it makes us makes as
worried because we are one step away

763
00:43:20,440 --> 00:43:25,450
this is one step closer to us if they
can get him for conspiracy

764
00:43:25,450 --> 00:43:29,840
which is on the charges that sent them
away conspiracies just talking to a

765
00:43:29,840 --> 00:43:31,650
bunch a people this is conspiracy

766
00:43:31,650 --> 00:43:35,010
2600 meeting is a conspiracy phone calls
me conspiracies

767
00:43:35,010 --> 00:43:39,330
and and the other thing they got a4 was
was possession access devices

768
00:43:39,330 --> 00:43:44,460
go back to be anything I number written
down a password even passwords that

769
00:43:44,460 --> 00:43:47,710
that have been expired have been
considered access devices

770
00:43:47,710 --> 00:43:51,290
Magneti five years in prison its it's
all screwed up

771
00:43:51,290 --> 00:43:54,990
and I think we need to to make sure my
nose is all screwed up

772
00:43:54,990 --> 00:43:58,300
south is a good they came out the fire
up the case I think more people heard

773
00:43:58,300 --> 00:43:58,830
about it

774
00:43:58,830 --> 00:44:03,350
was in a lot newspapers people really
get the sense that this was not the

775
00:44:03,350 --> 00:44:04,310
right thing to do

776
00:44:04,310 --> 00:44:07,490
arms I hope it never happens again but

777
00:44:07,490 --> 00:44:11,140
we are on the lookout for that lemme

778
00:44:11,140 --> 00:44:14,049
means millions

779
00:44:14,050 --> 00:44:16,040
loans living room

780
00:44:16,040 --> 00:44:19,950
rooms regarding internal documents more
kinds of places

781
00:44:19,950 --> 00:44:23,490
I it when such a case if

782
00:44:23,490 --> 00:44:27,280
it's interesting if it's something that
we feel our readers would benefit from

783
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:33,020
remaking the story out of it we will not
reveal the source have any documents we

784
00:44:33,020 --> 00:44:34,100
will never do that

785
00:44:34,100 --> 00:44:38,950
I however if somebody sends us something
we're not going to cover it up we're not

786
00:44:38,950 --> 00:44:39,950
going to say

787
00:44:39,950 --> 00:44:44,420
I'll this is proprietary information and
we can't do anything with it was out

788
00:44:44,420 --> 00:44:48,030
the new story is that we haven't okay
somebody gave it to us when they jumped

789
00:44:48,030 --> 00:44:49,260
into a trash can

790
00:44:49,260 --> 00:44:52,490
or or ban on a computer system someplace

791
00:44:52,490 --> 00:44:56,000
its out so according to a document we

792
00:44:56,000 --> 00:45:00,920
received this is you know it's not the
same thing is reprinting the document

793
00:45:00,920 --> 00:45:06,030
which is what the they tried to get
track for back in nineteen ninety seldom

794
00:45:06,030 --> 00:45:09,590
I that was a crazy case in itself but

795
00:45:09,590 --> 00:45:13,590
down me know if the lines are doesn't
mean that people are trying to change

796
00:45:13,590 --> 00:45:14,870
the lines

797
00:45:14,870 --> 00:45:17,990
doesn't mean that he could change next
year

798
00:45:17,990 --> 00:45:21,870
we have to be on the lookout for that
but we do know where we stand yeah

799
00:45:21,870 --> 00:45:26,210
no we don't and the moon's

800

817
00:46:29,790 --> 00:46:34,288
Rev Adam turn

harmonious him he won't tell me

821
00:46:45,680 --> 00:46:49,779
um 9 well I figured out party 9 a.m.

822
00:46:49,780 --> 00:46:53,910
10 my 55 lime 175 my

823
00:46:53,910 --> 00:46:58,520
that might 9941 I can't figure that out
is anybody out there no

824
00:46:58,520 --> 00:47:02,490
that secret code nine

825
00:47:02,490 --> 00:47:06,040
I i think that the current mine one

826
00:47:06,040 --> 00:47:11,240
917 Erica in a new york that is just for
beepers and pagers

827
00:47:11,240 --> 00:47:15,020
one my cell phones are

828
00:47:15,020 --> 00:47:21,900
and was the other board mine

829
00:47:21,900 --> 00:47:24,970
in five by five to be yeah I could be
information

830
00:47:24,970 --> 00:47:28,300
they vote not up to other companies now
to provide information services was in

831
00:47:28,300 --> 00:47:30,540
the bones

832
00:47:30,540 --> 00:47:36,509
9 expired well as nynex in in 10 by 55
with I no one here but me by the hair

833
00:47:36,510 --> 00:47:37,380
actors who

834
00:47:37,380 --> 00:47:40,810
for a company called will tell which is
9x will tell

835
00:47:40,810 --> 00:47:44,560
and i cant figure out there s where you
see

836
00:47:44,560 --> 00:47:48,070
the I would never understand about our
covers is that lotta times they mean

837
00:47:48,070 --> 00:47:50,390
different things to different people now

838
00:47:50,390 --> 00:47:54,990
while you may see nynex and we'll tell
information the 917 in there

839
00:47:54,990 --> 00:47:59,440
what I see is a mathematical equation
man if you follow that mathematical

840
00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:00,030
equation

841
00:48:00,030 --> 00:48:03,780
back nine times about 155 minus

842
00:48:03,780 --> 00:48:08,300
I 91,000 755

843
00:48:08,300 --> 00:48:12,740
I minus with the in cinemas one

844
00:48:12,740 --> 00:48:16,030
writings do that 41 yeah

845
00:48:16,030 --> 00:48:20,510
and it adds up to 2601 a

846
00:48:20,510 --> 00:48:27,510
good you have you know

847
00:48:27,540 --> 00:48:31,890
thanks mine

848
00:48:31,890 --> 00:48:35,629
well known you guys got it done

849
00:48:35,630 --> 00:48:40,170
and there's more to believe me once you
haven't seen biz does everyone know

850
00:48:40,170 --> 00:48:41,680
what's special about the a

851
00:48:41,680 --> 00:48:45,220
summer 1993 comer BR

852
00:48:45,220 --> 00:48:50,250
in a while though find a hacker cover
there were no its special about this one

853
00:48:50,250 --> 00:48:53,710
yeah I think we can put it on

854
00:48:53,710 --> 00:48:56,710
that was kinda weird part 1

855
00:48:56,710 --> 00:49:03,710
Union but the city Korean problems

856
00:49:04,300 --> 00:49:08,320
you may not see hmm nice job of
explaining

857
00:49:08,320 --> 00:49:11,400
on

858
00:49:11,400 --> 00:49:15,559
this well it turns out that under
certain lighting conditions

859
00:49:15,559 --> 00:49:19,740
the hacker will appear and I'm sure that
clearly cannot figure it out well when

860
00:49:19,740 --> 00:49:22,599
you read what that when it says in the
third dress

861
00:49:22,599 --> 00:49:29,599
and maybe that'll come in mine

862
00:49:29,609 --> 00:49:33,069
my line the right is black you

863
00:49:33,070 --> 00:49:38,560
use a black light and you'll see the
hacker 1

864
00:49:38,560 --> 00:49:40,839
because it's a pretty penny do you know

865
00:49:40,839 --> 00:49:44,969
got this big jar it says invisible
internet just like a cartoon

866
00:49:44,969 --> 00:49:47,729
and of course with you go out and buy
all those black lights you wanna check

867
00:49:47,729 --> 00:49:51,380
each and every issue because sometimes
we print an extra bonus particles

868
00:49:51,380 --> 00:49:56,259
in adding as well do that that's where
the real

869
00:49:56,259 --> 00:50:01,160
information is 9 give you get a blank
page must don't throw it out

870
00:50:01,160 --> 00:50:04,160
and allowed me to get my baby sometimes

871
00:50:04,160 --> 00:50:07,509
Michigan

872
00:50:07,509 --> 00:50:11,400
more on topical meetings are you gonna
be determined that these little pictures

873
00:50:11,400 --> 00:50:12,329
that are on the right here

874
00:50:12,329 --> 00:50:16,140
one what what what's the meaning behind
them my gun

875
00:50:16,140 --> 00:50:20,049
from his mom Ben Franklin's well you
know it's it's it's interesting because

876
00:50:20,049 --> 00:50:21,400
an early issues

877
00:50:21,400 --> 00:50:26,380
we have little I will these boxes came
from a mimosa big-name

878
00:50:26,380 --> 00:50:30,319
I just unlucky yeah did it was in
nineteen eighty-four so much

879
00:50:30,319 --> 00:50:34,440
new on but ran 1985 we just started
having

880
00:50:34,440 --> 00:50:37,640
little on is the way your nose like
everyone is when I

881
00:50:37,640 --> 00:50:41,558
guy pushing against the 2600 one

882
00:50:41,559 --> 00:50:45,369
gonna leave the doesn't whenever a
little artistic players there

883
00:50:45,369 --> 00:50:48,599
and then that that turn into a boxer
various

884
00:50:48,599 --> 00:50:53,829
I'll phone related items in when we
change form in 1987

885
00:50:53,829 --> 00:50:56,900
because I don't belong to the box and we
always put something manner

886
00:50:56,900 --> 00:51:00,079
kinda need in their now in this
particular case when he see them

887
00:51:00,079 --> 00:51:07,019
ben Brown with my fingers right now
bolivian do that's why things

888
00:51:07,019 --> 00:51:10,390
first mother's and his five fingers as a
as a unified things I believe

889
00:51:10,390 --> 00:51:14,400
are then he had a lawyer by thin now
who's with me in them at one point when

890
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:17,479
I was asleep because we couldn't find
his five fingers but we want to have

891
00:51:17,479 --> 00:51:18,450
been Franklin

892
00:51:18,450 --> 00:51:21,549
waving goodbye and the reason for that
was because

893
00:51:21,549 --> 00:51:25,479
we had named our laser printer after Ben
Franklin

894
00:51:25,479 --> 00:51:28,400
in fact if you look in the issues in the
shower that's there is always a shout

895
00:51:28,400 --> 00:51:31,599
out the Franklin I was our our trusty
Apple laser printer

896
00:51:31,599 --> 00:51:35,170
which was meeting us at that point and
now we have a new one

897
00:51:35,170 --> 00:51:38,339
well bother with the limited we've been
told that I am

898
00:51:38,339 --> 00:51:41,969

full time to basically go over the

899
00:51:41,969 --> 00:51:42,900
content in

900
00:51:42,900 --> 00:51:45,829
and everything again right we've been
told that so to make their lives

901
00:51:45,829 --> 00:51:47,059
interesting

902
00:51:47,059 --> 00:51:50,609
yeah not every item has

903
00:51:50,609 --> 00:51:54,170
symbolic content people come due in them
down kids nothing

904
00:51:54,170 --> 00:51:57,229
modern actually prisons paying

905
00:51:57,229 --> 00:52:01,369
people full time to go through 2700 RAM

912
00:52:18,539 --> 00:52:19,180
interesting

913
00:52:19,180 --> 00:52:23,259
but usually we have our subscriber in
prison who we letter from the

914
00:52:23,259 --> 00:52:27,759
prison that says was are you could we
can deliver this because I have

915
00:52:27,759 --> 00:52:29,989
something on page 23

916
00:52:29,989 --> 00:52:33,710
some once a once they screwed up in a
they

917
00:52:33,710 --> 00:52:37,599
they checked out the wrong box it said
we're sending sexually explicit material

918
00:52:37,599 --> 00:52:38,210
Lee

919
00:52:38,210 --> 00:52:41,720
then we went to the entire issue with a
fine tooth comb the final they're

920
00:52:41,720 --> 00:52:44,359
talking about turns out they checked the
wrong box

921
00:52:44,359 --> 00:52:50,040
it was it was invisible ink again this
the but we we usually do me gets two

922
00:52:50,040 --> 00:52:53,020
letters we printed but we found that
with prisons has to have a domino effect

923
00:52:53,020 --> 00:52:55,830
that if you see if you print the letter
from a prison saying

924
00:52:55,830 --> 00:52:59,490
that the magazine is not acceptable for
prison while another prison is gonna see

925
00:52:59,490 --> 00:53:01,680
that letter and say well this is an
example for us

926
00:53:01,680 --> 00:53:04,060
now all the sudden we're getting all
this mail back from prisons and

927
00:53:04,060 --> 00:53:06,349
prisoners on getting the point six
hundred

928
00:53:06,349 --> 00:53:10,820
some its kinda you know we we serve held
back on now is to get lotsa

929
00:53:10,820 --> 00:53:13,830
what the letters from prison same you
don't like we do in

930
00:53:13,830 --> 00:53:17,299
just another comment here you think you
guys could check out schematics before

931
00:53:17,300 --> 00:53:18,060
you print them

932
00:53:18,060 --> 00:53:22,490
you know the we do have a tradition yeah
I would like to go into that a little

933
00:53:22,490 --> 00:53:22,830
more

934
00:53:22,830 --> 00:53:27,990
him and united in our the tradition was
there long before I started by Tom

935
00:53:27,990 --> 00:53:31,849
really we try to do our best with that
and I and we have been good about

936
00:53:31,849 --> 00:53:32,760
corrections

937
00:53:32,760 --> 00:53:36,420
and this is what I would suggest me them
reprints the man schematic

938
00:53:36,420 --> 00:53:39,570
forget even there until the next issue
and then

939
00:53:39,570 --> 00:53:42,619
manage them a lead but I am I think for
instance

940
00:53:42,619 --> 00:53:46,130
probably referring to that them 2005
devices are never wrong

941
00:53:46,130 --> 00:53:50,300
just is probably well worth the wait
main keep you on

942
00:53:50,300 --> 00:53:53,990
people like me on on our toes billion on

943
00:53:53,990 --> 00:53:58,270
was written on a napkin and okay really
was hurt when he was designed and

944
00:53:58,270 --> 00:54:00,339
written on a napkin and

945
00:54:00,339 --> 00:54:03,500
it's just the dentist I guess where the
creases or

946
00:54:03,500 --> 00:54:06,859
made for misunderstanding up so it's
means

947
00:54:06,859 --> 00:54:11,970
their interest a napkin want one one
last question I just wanna find out

948
00:54:11,970 --> 00:54:16,250
arm what made all you guys get
interested in in like hacking this kind

949
00:54:16,250 --> 00:54:19,890
kinda stuff computers and icons met on
leave

950
00:54:19,890 --> 00:54:24,549
you know that I think Brad bound I was

951
00:54:24,550 --> 00:54:28,060
eighty and the and in like my

952
00:54:28,060 --> 00:54:31,670
from her at my my parents in one lead me
home alone so they sent me to this day

953
00:54:31,670 --> 00:54:32,800
care and they had a

954
00:54:32,800 --> 00:54:36,089
bold color computers andy san

955
00:54:36,089 --> 00:54:39,140
and how is like the type in basic and
like

956
00:54:39,140 --> 00:54:43,190
10 print ben is cool funny

957
00:54:43,190 --> 00:54:47,609
go to 10 and

958
00:54:47,609 --> 00:54:50,580
and when I did that the first time in
sao the teachers you know running

959
00:54:50,580 --> 00:54:51,440
towards me

960
00:54:51,440 --> 00:54:54,680
sniping trying the slimy anti-media we
knew that

961
00:54:54,680 --> 00:54:57,750
computer missed it was for me the

962
00:54:57,750 --> 00:55:02,510
on power I do that but

963
00:55:02,510 --> 00:55:08,680
I didn't I was twenty like

964
00:55:08,680 --> 00:55:12,010
the need to wonder about this well

965
00:55:12,010 --> 00:55:15,520
I'll I wanted my high school computer
room once

966
00:55:15,520 --> 00:55:19,160
and then I was going on $300 bond I

967
00:55:19,160 --> 00:55:22,259
digital printers which were bass back
then

968
00:55:22,260 --> 00:55:27,390
1977 I and I was fascinated by replaced
our tracking we would

969
00:55:27,390 --> 00:55:31,140
communicate with other schools and of
course I wound up doing something I was

970
00:55:31,140 --> 00:55:34,348
supposed to do an aikido the computer
room and not started on sort of a long

971
00:55:34,349 --> 00:55:36,730
and intense alicia gets continues to
this day

972
00:55:36,730 --> 00:55:40,750
via are fighting the rules and then
getting in trouble for various things

973
00:55:40,750 --> 00:55:41,430
and and

974
00:55:41,430 --> 00:55:45,829
getting further ahead as far as real
serious hacking though

975
00:55:45,829 --> 00:55:49,539
I have to stay I have to trace a lie
that back to computable to work although

976
00:55:49,539 --> 00:55:50,279
suny

977
00:55:50,279 --> 00:55:54,000
me many uses a bad my god

978
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:58,099
okay because the clap but them I

979
00:55:58,099 --> 00:56:02,000
Sherwood Forest alright

980
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:06,150
I and we met people on there I met
people on there

981
00:56:06,150 --> 00:56:10,619
that will really cool and we can have
invited them onto voice bulletin board

982
00:56:10,619 --> 00:56:11,839
systems called the

983
00:56:11,839 --> 00:56:16,230
IBM's audio distribution systems and you
never use those does recall

984
00:56:16,230 --> 00:56:19,980
one those were cool systems that they
ran on

985
00:56:19,980 --> 00:56:23,619
on these mainframes I think but you
could do all kinda neat things with the

986
00:56:23,619 --> 00:56:24,420
new can increase

987
00:56:24,420 --> 00:56:27,960
the speed of the %uh the playback you
can actually you can actually

988
00:56:27,960 --> 00:56:31,069
add a comment in the middle of the word
on somebody else's

989
00:56:31,069 --> 00:56:34,788
and and edit things was really pretty
neat whose can only gonna

990
00:56:34,789 --> 00:56:37,859
batch job teleconference yeah and the
great thing was

991
00:56:37,859 --> 00:56:41,450
yeah the great thing was that the

992
00:56:41,450 --> 00:56:45,829
that IBM had all the system the new ID
hundred-numbers in the course back then

993
00:56:45,829 --> 00:56:48,270
a donors didn't get your number that
when you call them

994
00:56:48,270 --> 00:56:52,859
and IBM employees would undoubtedly make
the password something like IBM or

995
00:56:52,859 --> 00:56:56,460
or their first name as a gay be their
first name when you call that it was it

996
00:56:56,460 --> 00:56:57,700
was relatively simple

997
00:56:57,700 --> 00:57:01,349
and then use it very much they use it
for business but they can use it for fun

998
00:57:01,349 --> 00:57:02,670
we use it for fun

999
00:57:02,670 --> 00:57:06,609
and I wasn't so therefore my start again
tied up by us that they started taking

1000
00:57:06,609 --> 00:57:08,670
notice of the fact that we were in the
more than they were

1001
00:57:08,670 --> 00:57:12,380
are but this game is not intended to
communicate coast to coast

1002
00:57:12,380 --> 00:57:16,289
absolutely for free it was most amazing
feeling that we could possibly have

1003
00:57:16,289 --> 00:57:20,299
not now a lot of us can do that legally
on the internet and that's pretty cool

1004
00:57:20,299 --> 00:57:23,720
I but that's how I got my start

1005
00:57:23,720 --> 00:57:27,319
bad lead to more things a including
indictments

1006
00:57:27,319 --> 00:57:32,308
by the hunt but I think it was the
feeling of just being able to

1007
00:57:32,309 --> 00:57:36,200
to access all this to get all all these
people that led to the founding the

1008
00:57:36,200 --> 00:57:38,029
magazine this led to more people

1009
00:57:38,029 --> 00:57:43,390
coming together and sharing information
miss

1010
00:57:43,390 --> 00:57:47,020
beverage that the decision are you ready
to start they could talk if the session

1011
00:57:47,020 --> 00:57:47,660
I

1012
00:57:47,660 --> 00:57:52,359
their numbers messaged

1013
00:57:52,359 --> 00:57:57,009
know the position know he's a okay
Muslim a question where

1014
00:57:57,009 --> 00:58:00,999
we're finished the bank gonna

1015
00:58:00,999 --> 00:58:04,100
for

1016
00:58:04,100 --> 00:58:11,100
for

1017
00:58:11,230 --> 00:58:18,230
driven

1018
00:58:18,480 --> 00:58:20,470
one

1019
00:58:20,470 --> 00:58:22,510
mines

1020
00:58:22,510 --> 00:58:23,650
1

1021
00:58:23,650 --> 00:58:25,700
the name

00:58:25,700 --> 00:58:29,019
line

1023
00:58:29,019 --> 00:58:32,140
I'm

1024
00:58:32,140 --> 00:58:33,270
down

1025
00:58:33,270 --> 00:58:34,480
you

1026
00:58:34,480 --> 00:58:35,950
I

1027
00:58:35,950 --> 00:58:37,220
funny thing happened

1028
00:58:37,220 --> 00:58:37,570
done
