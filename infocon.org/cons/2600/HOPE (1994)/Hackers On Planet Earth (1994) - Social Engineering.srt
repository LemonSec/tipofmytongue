%um and object through with those ones
during years

56
00:03:56,939 --> 00:04:01,090
years and making them believe you are

57
00:04:01,090 --> 00:04:05,260
who is opposed to review the information
we have the information you know

58
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:11,719
and on one of the ways you can do it is
by having information at your disposal

59
00:04:11,719 --> 00:04:16,149
that you share with them group my hope
in the you know your knowledge in so I

a headed back and they put it into a
handwritten letter to our PO Box 19

126
00:08:11,659 --> 00:08:16,710
AC calling I didn't send out unsolicited
as nightline wrong person yet they just

a they don't have time for home delivery
Olympics things that

131

134
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:49,380
slips and and islands has to do with
nynex I've heard I've heard stories from

135
00:08:49,380 --> 00:08:50,660

136
00:08:50,660 --> 00:08:54,860

telex wind

142
00:09:09,829 --> 00:09:14,490
always get a new route and I kinda
suspected the reason

143
00:09:14,490 --> 00:09:17,810
and the reason was I let it sit down
with the guys

144
00:09:17,810 --> 00:09:21,420
explain things to them and try to deal
with their job without

145
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:26,689
but the network did how to really work
and closer than you know so it doesn't I

146
00:09:26,689 --> 00:09:27,160

and I said well you know you can %uh 511
doing is another one

160
00:10:10,010 --> 00:10:13,029
is look at it for a second I just get
down on

161
00:10:13,029 --> 00:10:17,240
okay and when something does that didn't
quite mesh their

162
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:22,149
like so a what they doing about as big
as a great book that came outta

163
00:10:22,149 --> 00:10:26,220
maybe twenty years ago hope the biggest
company on earth news about the bell

164
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:26,910
system

165
00:10:26,910 --> 00:10:31,300
this is before the break up I and it was
all one big company they are your

166
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:35,709
only on the wire you only owned about
that why do the central office

167
00:10:35,709 --> 00:10:39,209
they own the central office and then one
Justin Smoak scary

168
00:10:39,209 --> 00:10:42,769
I news one day any follow us

169
00:10:42,769 --> 00:10:46,339
on as Latin against bus but

170
00:10:46,339 --> 00:10:49,350
locally was only have one only was the
at nynex

171
00:10:49,350 --> 00:10:52,519
and one of the things I know what I just
want to do is

172
00:10:52,519 --> 00:10:56,399
competition and local scale make things
more reason for us one thing but also

173
00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:56,990
give us

174
00:10:56,990 --> 00:11:02,610
on some may be cheaper prices I'm so
that's something that we're pushing for

175
00:11:02,610 --> 00:11:06,269
as well as I was leaving does though
there are

176
00:11:06,269 --> 00:11:12,220
I can I think the single company that is
immune from this that has not been

177
00:11:12,220 --> 00:11:14,040
similarly stupid things

178
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:19,490
on I was called to accompany Cable &
Wireless man stand with my coat was

179
00:11:19,490 --> 00:11:23,550
you know I despise it was my phone
number nato with my vote was no

180
00:11:23,550 --> 00:11:24,649
verification nothing

181
00:11:24,649 --> 00:11:28,939
another time I mean you have to see I
friends and family

182
00:11:28,939 --> 00:11:32,050
I was I was a great you know talking
about

183
00:11:32,050 --> 00:11:36,610
they have an eight hundred-number where
all you have to do is call the 800

184
00:11:36,610 --> 00:11:38,309
number into your phone number

185
00:11:38,309 --> 00:11:45,309
and as security and two years it had con
and I'll tell you all ten people on your

186
00:11:46,819 --> 00:11:48,300
own you calling circle which

187
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:51,290
include people with unlisted phone
numbers and knowing that you find out

188
00:11:51,290 --> 00:11:52,559
how they're related to you

189
00:11:52,559 --> 00:11:55,929
your brother at 91 or whatever little

190
00:11:55,929 --> 00:12:00,559
you know your whenever they it is but i
wasnt nation

191
00:12:00,559 --> 00:12:04,319
only change that because we broadcast
over the radio here

192
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:08,340
I and I now you have to get

193
00:12:08,340 --> 00:12:12,180
I think or have your account number much
is not very hard to get you there

194
00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:15,790
so it's always possible to get
information from

195
00:12:15,790 --> 00:12:19,310
he's not need it doesn't stop movies
either any entity

00:12:19,310 --> 00:12:23,550
any evil I mean people type solutions

help you on his on like that held

202
00:12:41,890 --> 00:12:48,590
with everything to leave my

203
00:12:48,590 --> 00:12:51,610
Mar she said %uh

204
00:12:51,610 --> 00:12:55,290
that social engineers don't last within
the phone company but

205
00:12:55,290 --> 00:12:59,300
actually met the guy in game the
Amsterdam area that

206
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:03,840
that does things in social engineering
way if the phone company can figure it

207
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:04,540
out anymore

208
00:13:04,540 --> 00:13:08,670
at some point we had four different
contracts or dream about ninety phone

209
00:13:08,670 --> 00:13:12,090
lines in a very old building that had
four different phone feeds coming in

210
00:13:12,090 --> 00:13:18,270
and after three weeks is messing with it
by I fifteen different people coming in

211
00:13:18,270 --> 00:13:18,900
and out in

212
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:23,010
they lost track and the only record that
was available if anything ever happened

213
00:13:23,010 --> 00:13:23,300
at

214
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:28,260
it matched the truth somehow the record
we had we had to give them every time

215
00:13:28,260 --> 00:13:32,450
to I have all the numbers for all the
boxes coming out a simple office have

216
00:13:32,450 --> 00:13:33,510
been members there

217
00:13:33,510 --> 00:13:37,050
the numbers mystery but is everything
meant to give it to them every time an

218
00:13:37,050 --> 00:13:37,900
end at some point

219
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:42,500
they sent as the guy that the San it if
all else fails and thats a social

220
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:43,070
engineer

221
00:13:43,070 --> 00:13:47,390
has two be had big exporters to hack his
own company to get make

222
00:13:47,390 --> 00:13:51,280

223
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:55,850
it all else fails in the customers
complaining after month the senior

224
00:13:55,850 --> 00:13:57,220
social engineering neck I

225
00:13:57,220 --> 00:14:00,440
is exactly what I would do he calls up
says

226
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:04,580
the order did go in but it was in three
weeks ago and he just didn't notice even

227
00:14:04,580 --> 00:14:05,190
though it wasn't

228
00:14:05,190 --> 00:14:09,230
in he just does all the tricks that we
would do to get service quickly but he

229
00:14:09,230 --> 00:14:10,930
doesn't listen to his own company

230
00:14:10,930 --> 00:14:13,960
I you

231
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:20,960

233
00:14:28,610 --> 00:14:35,610

237
00:14:47,210 --> 00:14:52,339
I'm we're at university is two years ago

mainframe and they wouldn't us I was
privileged information

239
00:14:56,860 --> 00:15:00,210
no media computer elitists so

240
00:15:00,210 --> 00:15:04,580
we call up the the computer center and
we asked them

241
00:15:04,580 --> 00:15:08,260
did some some social engineering tricks
which did not work at all

242
00:15:08,260 --> 00:15:11,260
and they say but when I tell you this
this this is not me

243
00:15:11,260 --> 00:15:14,529

time on one end in a hung up in

244
00:15:14,529 --> 00:15:18,930
very depressed very upset that we could
get this information either one of us

245
00:15:18,930 --> 00:15:22,900
up to one after a few minutes to call
again

246
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:27,480

247
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:31,670

Administration we heard what that what

248
00:15:31,670 --> 00:15:33,640
just happened at the white house about

249
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:37,270

00:15:55,980 --> 00:16:02,980
yeah a

257
00:16:06,579 --> 00:16:08,129
affirmative wasn't

258
00:16:08,129 --> 00:16:12,279
well sure you all know how helpful the
phone company tends to be

259
00:16:12,279 --> 00:16:16,059
when they want to be and thing up on
companies is that they are a %ah

260
00:16:16,059 --> 00:16:19,329
a service-based organization so they
they aim to please

261
00:16:19,329 --> 00:16:24,600
so if you call them up and ask them for
help lionized English department at you

262
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:24,939
get

263
00:16:24,939 --> 00:16:28,699
dash can be very helpful any not doing
things but you can give you live

264
00:16:28,699 --> 00:16:29,439
information

265
00:16:29,439 --> 00:16:33,389
so I is one here familiar with what a
CNA

266
00:16:33,389 --> 00:16:36,899
is in to it

267
00:16:36,899 --> 00:16:39,690
no yeah

268
00:16:39,690 --> 00:16:43,639
a cuts customer name and address it's a
reverse lookup

269
00:16:43,639 --> 00:16:46,750
phone numbers you by phone number and
they provide

270
00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:52,100
the name and address and there's one in
the area code 313 its automated

271
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:55,649
and it's pretty much public knowledge
that no that is 313

272
00:16:55,649 --> 00:16:59,889
44 yeah

273
00:16:59,889 --> 00:17:02,940
all nine hundred its pretty much public
knowledge

274
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:06,589
um a

275
00:17:06,589 --> 00:17:11,948
yeah however the up

276
00:17:11,949 --> 00:17:14,699
according to all public policy I don't
believe they're supposed to give that

277
00:17:14,699 --> 00:17:15,470
number out

278
00:17:15,470 --> 00:17:19,049
or anything like that even though it is
I'm sure

279
00:17:19,049 --> 00:17:22,689
another ten years Detroit its

280
00:17:22,689 --> 00:17:27,549
I love it less than that up it's been
around for years and I'm sure made it so

281
00:17:27,549 --> 00:17:30,000
I'm threatening letters saying you
publish something that

282
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,840
was I suppose we given out but its
public knowledge anyway

283
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:38,408
so so we'll see if we can get Windows

284
00:17:38,409 --> 00:17:41,769
okay and I wasn't even do okay I'm going
to

285
00:17:41,769 --> 00:17:44,929
culture than other this number I just
given to everyone

286
00:17:44,929 --> 00:17:48,919
problem I a be long distance carriers

287
00:17:48,919 --> 00:17:52,769

290
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:03,140
the training in on this really sucks
yeah

291
00:18:03,140 --> 00:18:07,790
they they got the information freely and
I don't know why and if you feel your

292
00:18:07,790 --> 00:18:09,190
information is secure with them

293
00:18:09,190 --> 00:18:13,090
I don't know I feel that way I really
want to say but

294
00:18:13,090 --> 00:18:16,300
I lot of people here have legitimate
sprint

490
00:32:57,480 --> 00:32:59,119
engineered a voicemail company

00:33:09,749 --> 00:33:12,950
n that means you can do certain things
you have never changing them

495
00:33:12,950 --> 00:33:13,779
disconnected

496
00:33:13,779 --> 00:33:16,940

usually

499
00:33:21,619 --> 00:33:25,109
and then you can simply take it from
there the good thing about social

500
00:33:25,109 --> 00:33:26,950
engineering that the funding is it

501

503
00:33:34,779 --> 00:33:35,609
the person who's

504
00:33:35,609 --> 00:33:39,639

which will prevent anybody else from
accessing my records

508
00:33:47,970 --> 00:33:52,129
well if I do before the real person
