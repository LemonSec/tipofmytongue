1
00:00:03,050 --> 00:00:05,860
the

2
00:00:05,860 --> 00:00:09,940
the

3
00:00:09,940 --> 00:00:12,040
in Asia

4
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:18,330
the

5
00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:25,330
the

6
00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:30,740
in

7
00:00:30,740 --> 00:00:37,740
yeah

8
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:50,490
in

9
00:00:50,490 --> 00:00:53,149
in

10
00:00:53,149 --> 00:00:55,829
the

11
00:00:55,829 --> 00:01:01,730
the

12
00:01:01,730 --> 00:01:08,090
the

13
00:01:08,090 --> 00:01:09,130
the

14
00:01:09,130 --> 00:01:16,130
in

15
00:01:18,140 --> 00:01:21,280
the

16
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:24,420
yes

17
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:28,430
the

18
00:01:28,430 --> 00:01:30,890
India

19
00:01:30,890 --> 00:01:33,659
the

20
00:01:33,659 --> 00:01:37,450
the

21
00:01:37,450 --> 00:01:40,170
the

22
00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:43,340
the

23
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:46,330
the

24
00:01:46,330 --> 00:01:52,548
the

25
00:01:52,549 --> 00:01:56,010
the

26
00:01:56,010 --> 00:01:59,090
the

27
00:01:59,090 --> 00:02:06,090
this

28
00:02:12,470 --> 00:02:18,120
you

29
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:24,109
the

30
00:02:24,109 --> 00:02:27,180
the

31
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:31,160
yeah

32
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:33,470
the

33
00:02:33,470 --> 00:02:36,550
my if you're here for fun with teenagers

34
00:02:36,550 --> 00:02:39,630
I we're gonna try reschedule that for
tomorrow

35
00:02:39,630 --> 00:02:43,010
the

36
00:02:43,010 --> 00:02:46,129
if Paul Bergman is here for the

37
00:02:46,129 --> 00:02:53,129
the control the world from your PC
please come up to the front now

38
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:57,120
anybody know reas yes

39
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:58,110
a

40
00:02:58,110 --> 00:02:59,980
the

41
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:03,579
their wares the

42
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:05,250
nine

43
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:07,840
the

44
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:08,410
the

45
00:03:08,410 --> 00:03:15,120
know wayne raney your the

46
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:17,100
the my book in such an

47
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:20,860
they say someone can certainly be in
five minutes

48
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:24,900
so I had the setup and I apologize um

49
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:29,310
I have the distinction of being the only
person in this room that's going on

50
00:03:29,310 --> 00:03:30,380
there is no name

51
00:03:30,380 --> 00:03:33,970
me and Tom

52
00:03:33,970 --> 00:03:38,000
my name is on my badge my name is Paul
Bergman

53
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,010
I come from Philadelphia and I've been
playing with computers for

54
00:03:42,010 --> 00:03:46,380
couple years and I'm a member of the
Philadelphia area

55
00:03:46,380 --> 00:03:53,140
Computer Society packs and for the last
ten or twelve years

56
00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:56,700
I have been the leader of the robotics
and engineering sig

57
00:03:56,700 --> 00:04:01,550
sig mean special interest group and

58
00:04:01,550 --> 00:04:04,900
we wanted to build things that we
connect to our computers

59
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:08,180
but when I started some people had a Dr
I am

60
00:04:08,180 --> 00:04:12,800
some people had a Commodore some people
had apples and some people were getting

61
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:13,930
and IBM

62
00:04:13,930 --> 00:04:18,090
and if we were gonna build things and
removed from the computer

63
00:04:18,090 --> 00:04:21,270
how are we all gonna use the same
computer

64
00:04:21,269 --> 00:04:26,020
we can't we all on the in one room there
would be an apple signal on other rooms

65
00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:26,780
Commodore

66
00:04:26,780 --> 00:04:30,020
so we had many many different computers
meeting at

67
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:34,020
the three love your computer society and
we needed a way

68
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:38,820
we can all use the same thing so we try
couple different ideas

69
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:42,230
the first thing with love

70
00:04:42,230 --> 00:04:46,980
was the game board me n just the just
this once and then I won't have to look

71
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:48,120
at it again

72
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:51,210
to this little parallax as I can

73
00:04:51,210 --> 00:04:56,330
yo means

74
00:04:56,330 --> 00:05:01,050
um posting look that was the game portal

75
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:05,280
this is a game port on the IBM computer
and

76
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:08,920
some you have a wave reading in

77
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:14,130
were different varying the values which
we call

78
00:05:14,130 --> 00:05:19,070
analog and you have a couple buttons for
buttons

79
00:05:19,070 --> 00:05:22,940
and you could really bring in some
information to your computer

80
00:05:22,940 --> 00:05:27,840
but you can't help with anything with
this and the worst problem is

81
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:31,720
the what's on the IBM is not what's on
an Apple

82
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:36,600
and it's not what's on the Commodore
everybody's game port is different so we

83
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:38,440
can talk the same language

84
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:42,580
and we want to do worry about circuits
we could make we don't worry that a

85
00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:43,250
computer

86
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:46,850
so we couldn't do that if we use the
game port was everybody's is different

87
00:05:46,850 --> 00:05:51,140
so that we do that idea and sorry have
the key turning my back but

88
00:05:51,140 --> 00:05:55,390
there's no table here for me to put this
the phone the next thing that that was

89
00:05:55,390 --> 00:05:55,789
the

90
00:05:55,790 --> 00:06:01,120
serial port yo the serial ports kinda
neat yo

91
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:05,450
mmm every computer seems to have a
serial port

92
00:06:05,450 --> 00:06:08,500
even imagine mind

93
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:11,830
they didn't Ryan come up with their own
standard for cereal

94
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:15,839
so you can look things to do it

95
00:06:15,839 --> 00:06:17,879
the problem is it to go

96
00:06:17,879 --> 00:06:22,689
in serially means the computer usually
talks about a bite and information

97
00:06:22,689 --> 00:06:27,050
eight bits and they're all there at the
same time

98
00:06:27,050 --> 00:06:31,719
now if you wanna go see really got the
one behind the other yet that is stop it

99
00:06:31,719 --> 00:06:36,459
you have that started you have to have a
parity bit you got about eleven bits

100
00:06:36,459 --> 00:06:37,770
there you something out

101
00:06:37,770 --> 00:06:42,979
one end to the other and then has to be
converted back to

102
00:06:42,979 --> 00:06:46,949
parallel because the chips most the morn
work in parallel

103
00:06:46,949 --> 00:06:50,369
your computer once the work with
parallel a bit at the same time

104
00:06:50,369 --> 00:06:54,709
so you're you're slowing things down the
one 11

105
00:06:54,709 --> 00:07:01,119
the real speed that you can get and it's
really slow and you must add the extra

106
00:07:01,119 --> 00:07:01,919
circuitry

107
00:07:01,919 --> 00:07:05,758
this is a shit that only cause the four
dollars it them

108
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:08,939
an active electronics are digi-key

109
00:07:08,939 --> 00:07:12,369
and it will convert parallel to serial
on 02 parallel

110
00:07:12,369 --> 00:07:15,569
you got a bit in a bit sale and it comes
in through

111
00:07:15,569 --> 00:07:20,189
the serial port and you have to convert
it to welcome

112
00:07:20,189 --> 00:07:23,389
plus or minus 12 volts because most
things

113
00:07:23,389 --> 00:07:28,459
in a computer work on 0n five what's the
logic is the one where 0

114
00:07:28,459 --> 00:07:33,809
me and we if it's the T 00 .000 were too
many faults but we'll talk about the 15

115
00:07:33,809 --> 00:07:34,629
goals but its

116
00:07:34,629 --> 00:07:39,339
just the small signal will we keep and
the serial port once

117
00:07:39,339 --> 00:07:43,099
waldholtz for 0n -12 wats

118
00:07:43,099 --> 00:07:46,490
for one and you know why they do that

119
00:07:46,490 --> 00:07:50,740
anybody got an idea why they went to
these big voltages anyone know

120
00:07:50,740 --> 00:07:54,039
why we use serial ports with such big
mortgages well

121
00:07:54,039 --> 00:07:59,039
why is the parallel port not good for
some things that this report is what's

122
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:01,818
the serial port good for the Hindu the
parallel port yessir

123
00:08:01,819 --> 00:08:05,669
sorry oh yeah much was wiring you're
right

124
00:08:05,669 --> 00:08:08,979
it's only two it was the pair well three
wise you know

125
00:08:08,979 --> 00:08:12,998
any ground three wires that's true the
distance

126
00:08:12,999 --> 00:08:15,999
mean gets a silver you not gonna get a
free book but you get a young

127
00:08:15,999 --> 00:08:19,619
people either way it's okay well maybe
you'll get a kiss that knows that

128
00:08:19,619 --> 00:08:23,370
I I'm if you see really

129
00:08:23,370 --> 00:08:27,199
with plus and minus 12 volts that's 24
volts

130
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:32,680
difference between the do and therefore
you can go we've much larger distance

131
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:36,649
before that voltage can be seen on the
other hand

132
00:08:36,649 --> 00:08:39,938
with the parallel port with TTL

133
00:08:39,938 --> 00:08:44,110
which is what most ships are you only
have a zero net to an Indian faults and

134
00:08:44,110 --> 00:08:45,319
that's a pretty weak signal

135
00:08:45,319 --> 00:08:49,410
so in the parallel port you can go as
far because it's the very weak signals

136
00:08:49,410 --> 00:08:52,860
but is it so that is an advantage to the
serial port

137
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:57,279
and the two wires is an advantage if you
want to make sure that what you're

138
00:08:57,279 --> 00:08:57,990
connecting

139
00:08:57,990 --> 00:09:02,339
outside you wanna isolated from your
computer and you want to make sure that

140
00:09:02,339 --> 00:09:03,569
if lightning hits

141
00:09:03,569 --> 00:09:07,149
something you won't get in your computer
you can up the couple

142
00:09:07,149 --> 00:09:10,939
you put a little light beam between you
in their computer in the only thing

143
00:09:10,939 --> 00:09:11,459
that's

144
00:09:11,459 --> 00:09:15,990
connecting is a light beam you lived out
the couple two wires instead of

145
00:09:15,990 --> 00:09:19,779
beat wires so there are some advantages
the serial

146
00:09:19,779 --> 00:09:22,889
but it's really slow and all that shit
it's a lotta money

147
00:09:22,889 --> 00:09:27,449
so we can it disregarded that he never
really that duo

148
00:09:27,449 --> 00:09:33,650
so what did we do the we looked at the
parallel port you

149
00:09:33,650 --> 00:09:36,250
but many the parallel purely is really
neat

150
00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:40,670
the reason it's neat is everybody's
parallel printer port

151
00:09:40,670 --> 00:09:45,310
is exactly the same serial port by the
way is not the same

152
00:09:45,310 --> 00:09:48,450
there's a story remember there was
somebody wrote in a in a computer

153
00:09:48,450 --> 00:09:50,360
magazine that they went into a store

154
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:54,890
and they said I need a serial cable know
the serial cable to go from this printer

155
00:09:54,890 --> 00:09:58,939
to this computer niece it's certainly
sir you need a 3x 21 anyone to this

156
00:09:58,940 --> 00:09:59,440
board

157
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:03,170
in there was fifty serial cables all
different for different

158
00:10:03,170 --> 00:10:06,430
hookups and he said no that is not there
will make you want

159
00:10:06,430 --> 00:10:11,170
and the thing is that cereal is not
standard everybody has their own way

160
00:10:11,170 --> 00:10:13,500
each company uses their only if
connecting

161
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:18,350
ADB sometimes they call the DTE what is
in you know once a computer in the other

162
00:10:18,350 --> 00:10:19,350
is a term loan

163
00:10:19,350 --> 00:10:23,110
night on %uh they got a whole bunch a
standard seat you can even talk the same

164
00:10:23,110 --> 00:10:24,080
with the Syrian

165
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:27,590
with the parallel port every single pin
was defined

166
00:10:27,590 --> 00:10:31,970
by the isn't Ronix company when they
made the first parliamentary

167
00:10:31,970 --> 00:10:35,910
and everybody uses the same pins and
they all mean the same thing and they

168
00:10:35,910 --> 00:10:37,260
all do the same thing

169
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:40,870
nothing is different when any computer
they're all the same

170
00:10:40,870 --> 00:10:43,880
we can use this then and

171
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:47,270
by the way when you're talking to a
printer every language

172
00:10:47,270 --> 00:10:53,150
has the means to talk to brinner mean
the basic you can say open

173
00:10:53,150 --> 00:10:56,770
you know the scale you can say wait

174
00:10:56,770 --> 00:10:59,920
rate mind in NC

175
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:06,020
it takes about Katy Perry but it's the
words the regular army

176
00:11:06,020 --> 00:11:09,980
so we started using this parallel
printer port

177
00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:13,030
in what I did I started taking notes
over the last five years

178
00:11:13,030 --> 00:11:16,560
and I put it all together and I wrote a
book

179
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:22,220
which is you mean was brave enough to
buy gold controlling your world with the

180
00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:24,090
quote that role in the world with your
PC

181
00:11:24,090 --> 00:11:28,230
that's why I had to use my real name you
me and Dom

182
00:11:28,230 --> 00:11:31,340
if you wanna make a living

183
00:11:31,340 --> 00:11:34,460
writing a book I'll tell you that if I
sell out the first bringing

184
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:37,800
I'd me thirty two and a half cents an
hour so

185
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:40,800
before you think you're going to get
rich writing a book think again

186
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:44,950
and any rate um I put it all down and
it's all

187
00:11:44,950 --> 00:11:50,670
in water now in a tall handsome logic in
basically a targeted the book

188
00:11:50,670 --> 00:11:55,360
do three audiences students we left like
high school and such they wanna make

189
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:56,640
science fair projects

190
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:59,830
college engineering students who have to
do see

191
00:11:59,830 --> 00:12:03,900
I took the year sabbatical as a teacher
I teach industrial lights for twenty two

192
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:04,440
years

193
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:09,530
in a in my for my sabbatical I went once
a week up to chance the college in a

194
00:12:09,530 --> 00:12:14,959
enter an electric car contest means that
might work on it and I was enjoyed

195
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:18,420
making some of the sensors that would
connect to a laptop computer

196
00:12:18,420 --> 00:12:22,040
so they could monitor the battery
temperature the speed you know the

197
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:25,589
things that's all the tribes just been
doing with my book and they let me work

198
00:12:25,590 --> 00:12:26,130
with it

199
00:12:26,130 --> 00:12:29,930
and it was interesting every student in
engineering

200
00:12:29,930 --> 00:12:34,340
must do a senior project and if you know
it run its engineering it must

201
00:12:34,340 --> 00:12:40,090
include a computer and it turned out
that every single engineering student

202
00:12:40,090 --> 00:12:43,180
needed one other circuits that I was
waiting for my book

203
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:47,120
and of course I gave them the circuits
for free any night I just gave the tomb

204
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:51,220
in the reform in Minister not to spread
it around to the book %uh published

205
00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:54,810
than that but it was interesting that so
many people needed

206
00:12:54,810 --> 00:12:57,930
this kinda stuff there's engineering
students and they just didn't know the

207
00:12:57,930 --> 00:13:00,090
in a program the unity is undergoing

208
00:13:00,090 --> 00:13:04,820
the mechanic to do things together in
Leesburg group of people are

209
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:07,260
subterranean hardware hackers do you
know what they are

210
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:10,800
there

211
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:16,350
there the weekend hacker that works in
his basement in subterranean hardware

212
00:13:16,350 --> 00:13:19,470
maker mean me it's getting really

213
00:13:19,470 --> 00:13:22,950
I guess you only go to dinner in

214
00:13:22,950 --> 00:13:29,740
this in the I will not till midnight for
this party last night that didn't exist

215
00:13:29,740 --> 00:13:31,440
so I'm a little tired

216
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:34,730
and song that's as good as they've gone
again

217
00:13:34,730 --> 00:13:38,180
me know more younger than me

218
00:13:38,180 --> 00:13:43,110
the the I divided everything in the two
sections and we're gonna look at some

219
00:13:43,110 --> 00:13:44,270
output circuits

220
00:13:44,270 --> 00:13:48,350
we can turn control things from your
computer

221
00:13:48,350 --> 00:13:53,740
and imports were you can read things
into your computer and such out which is

222
00:13:53,740 --> 00:13:57,620
these basic circuits that we looked at
and displays like liquid crystal

223
00:13:57,620 --> 00:13:58,960
displays and

224
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:04,530
mmm only displays and of course we can
control motors

225
00:14:04,530 --> 00:14:09,199
0 stepping motors servo motors in the
inputs with the digital workers high or

226
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:09,750
low

227
00:14:09,750 --> 00:14:13,180
or analog like the temperature in the
room in your house

228
00:14:13,180 --> 00:14:17,780
those in blue this much then this much
in this much is a smooth distances

229
00:14:17,780 --> 00:14:18,430
changes

230
00:14:18,430 --> 00:14:22,030
and that's cool analog and you can input
analog to your computer

231
00:14:22,030 --> 00:14:27,230
so we'll look at some others things so
the first thing a look at women do these

232
00:14:27,230 --> 00:14:29,800
tiny quickly because we don't take too
long

233
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:35,770
are some displays you let's look at it
this morning

234
00:14:35,770 --> 00:14:39,920
the easiest thing you can do

235
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:42,110
me his control and LED

236
00:14:42,110 --> 00:14:47,060
now this funny little symbol is an LED
LED is a little diode and its sensitive

237
00:14:47,060 --> 00:14:49,140
to light and when it does it immensely

238
00:14:49,140 --> 00:14:53,589
unfortunately it might with a daily
these in the front of the room I don't

239
00:14:53,589 --> 00:14:55,190
think you would see them very well

240
00:14:55,190 --> 00:14:59,480
with the camera blasting and these
lights on so

241
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:03,399
I put a little but for in the circuit

242
00:15:03,399 --> 00:15:07,529
and instead using LED's I'm going to
cheat everything's exactly the same as

243
00:15:07,529 --> 00:15:08,260
it would be

244
00:15:08,260 --> 00:15:12,269
but I'm cheating because you wouldn't
see it and I know these lights appear

245
00:15:12,269 --> 00:15:16,110
and they're running on five waltz you
put this little circuit that makes the

246
00:15:16,110 --> 00:15:19,370
little teeny weeny voltage is coming
under your computer a little stronger

247
00:15:19,370 --> 00:15:23,880
and that's quite a buffer all the
circuits by the way in the book so don't

248
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:24,390
wait

249
00:15:24,390 --> 00:15:29,140
it's easy to pick up -ism and the the
subways and C Pascal and basic

250
00:15:29,140 --> 00:15:33,170
but for the purposes this audience and
after talking the most people there are

251
00:15:33,170 --> 00:15:35,100
some see gruza out there

252
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:38,440
but I think we ought to talk in the
language a basic year because it might

253
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:41,029
be a little easier and it comes on your
computer for free

254
00:15:41,029 --> 00:15:45,290
and let's look at the basic program him
economy these lights light up

255
00:15:45,290 --> 00:15:48,469
with i connect them to the purported

256
00:15:48,470 --> 00:15:52,990
mean that looks like a problem you know
what should I do

257
00:15:52,990 --> 00:15:56,040
well it's lookin you can look over the
scene

258
00:15:56,040 --> 00:16:00,240
okay okay you know many bits are there

259
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:05,800
on a parallel port how many bits in a
byte very good

260
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:09,270
eighty usually we call that

261
00:16:09,270 --> 00:16:13,160
bit is one through eight but in fact we
call them

262
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:17,620
0 through 7 you don't start with one you
start with 0

263
00:16:17,620 --> 00:16:20,910
remote joke about why in a minute so we
have to the

264
00:16:20,910 --> 00:16:24,160
late tomorrow millet see

265
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:28,410
if I send numbers out here I can light
them up

266
00:16:28,410 --> 00:16:31,990
so if I send the number one the first
LED light up

267
00:16:31,990 --> 00:16:35,089
nice in the number two this 10

268
00:16:35,089 --> 00:16:39,910
reasons you get the second Malad up me
send the three

269
00:16:39,910 --> 00:16:43,930
both in the light up no combo from a
layup with 3

270
00:16:43,930 --> 00:16:48,089
its binary its binary we're sending
binary

271
00:16:48,089 --> 00:16:52,279
so we can so if I want to send let's
send every number from 0

272
00:16:52,279 --> 00:16:56,810
to 250 I

273
00:16:56,810 --> 00:17:00,540
because there's twenty six different
things but the first 10

274
00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:04,689
so we go from 0 to 255 I once in every
number out there

275
00:17:04,689 --> 00:17:09,550
help you nice n numbers out to the
printer port anybody got an idea

276
00:17:09,550 --> 00:17:13,559
and it's the same no matter what
computer using let's do it basic how do

277
00:17:13,559 --> 00:17:14,639
I do it

278
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:18,150
no well

279
00:17:18,150 --> 00:17:22,400
we're not ready for al I needed thats to
avoid mouth is kinda hard construction

280
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:25,510
first for the Jew out you have to know
the address

281
00:17:25,510 --> 00:17:30,580
and that's the freemen every computer
what do you wanna do sir riney

282
00:17:30,580 --> 00:17:34,550
if I praying it goes to the screen help
me

283
00:17:34,550 --> 00:17:38,059
will do it very good you wanna kiss to

284
00:17:38,059 --> 00:17:42,470
no okay let's tell brennan's

285
00:17:42,470 --> 00:17:45,200
the

286
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:50,059
the and there you go if I simply say

287
00:17:50,059 --> 00:17:54,100
L print character 64

288
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:57,500
it will send the binary number

289
00:17:57,500 --> 00:18:04,169
64 to the parallel port if you just said
L print 64 its gonna descent two little

290
00:18:04,169 --> 00:18:07,880
numbers that represent the ASCII
president it's tempting to a printer in

291
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:09,760
the printer knows that certain numbers

292
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:14,250
my form certain pixels together we just
want to send the number 64

293
00:18:14,250 --> 00:18:19,049
if I send the number 64 how many only
these will light up so many

294
00:18:19,049 --> 00:18:23,250
but I send the number 64

295
00:18:23,250 --> 00:18:29,330
which one

296
00:18:29,330 --> 00:18:34,260
very the numbers would be 124 8 16 32 64
the 71

297
00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:38,720
unit should light up now I can do the
same thing

298
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:43,770
in by the way went with this is the
whole heart and how you do everything I

299
00:18:43,770 --> 00:18:46,200
wanna show you today so that's when
taking a little time

300
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:49,210
you know print Garrett 264

301
00:18:49,210 --> 00:18:52,230
will send the number 64 to a printer

302
00:18:52,230 --> 00:18:57,180
and what happens if do you finish bring
to a printer what this the computer do

303
00:18:57,180 --> 00:18:57,910
next

304
00:18:57,910 --> 00:19:00,980
sends a carriage return and line feed

305
00:19:00,980 --> 00:19:05,060
no one is in the country during line
feed so in basically put this little

306
00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:06,220
comment at the end

307
00:19:06,220 --> 00:19:10,250
and little comatose basically send that
number

308
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:14,420
and style just sweep don't go to the
next line

309
00:19:14,420 --> 00:19:18,790
we so if you want to do the same thing
in

310
00:19:18,790 --> 00:19:23,970
and scale you use the LSD command in
this works in every version a pencil

311
00:19:23,970 --> 00:19:27,440
you see right nail

312
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:30,640
the semicolon year if you don't know
Pascal just tells at the moment the in

313
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:33,110
the line is nothing to do with energy
turns

314
00:19:33,110 --> 00:19:36,570
right means send this out and we did

315
00:19:36,570 --> 00:19:41,919
haiti's in the carriage return Pascale
right line so we're not gonna do that

316
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:45,590
now instead of just sending one line of
code

317
00:19:45,590 --> 00:19:49,699
I want to send every combination member
then so I'm gonna do

318
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:53,380
is I'm gonna say for equal 00:02:56

319
00:19:53,380 --> 00:19:57,280
you can see them ok and some

320
00:19:57,280 --> 00:20:00,490
all print character he we did

321
00:20:00,490 --> 00:20:04,860
then do the next number now that's
what's on the screen

322
00:20:04,860 --> 00:20:11,860
rate now

323
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:18,080
that's what's on your screen read here
and I added another line

324
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:23,139
it says not only planet for their
printed on the screen so I supplement

325
00:20:23,140 --> 00:20:27,540
the old number and if I did that it
happened so fast

326
00:20:27,540 --> 00:20:31,310
that this thing looks like the rule it
once I had to slow it down

327
00:20:31,310 --> 00:20:35,750
so and one more line it says for XC cool
zeroed it is 400

328
00:20:35,750 --> 00:20:39,120
next X and I just knew duran and then go
to the next line

329
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:42,120
so now they say alternate one-for-one

330
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:47,130
it's a story each of these LED's

331
00:20:47,130 --> 00:20:51,790
I can see okay I'm learning every
combination now

332
00:20:51,790 --> 00:20:55,879
of the LED's and then I guess the end it
was back in does it again

333
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:59,190
does that make sense am I gonna go on if
there's no make sense

334
00:20:59,190 --> 00:21:02,380
because this is the crux at how you talk
to something

335
00:21:02,380 --> 00:21:05,750
instead of an elite the only thing was
figure we make it more power

336
00:21:05,750 --> 00:21:08,820
and I can learn motors I can with the
crystal displays

337
00:21:08,820 --> 00:21:12,310
I can learn your garage door I can make
coffee in the morning the same

338
00:21:12,310 --> 00:21:13,370
instructions

339
00:21:13,370 --> 00:21:16,840
and I just do something a little
different is that makes sense waitin

340
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:19,840
okay the number to stop mean

341
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:25,110
Nexus not itself you can see what we can
do this useful be site silly these

342
00:21:25,110 --> 00:21:29,020
the let's look at some stuff now we can
move a little quicker

343
00:21:29,020 --> 00:21:32,670
0 they actually

344
00:21:32,670 --> 00:21:35,780
I did make a drawing up a ladylike with
that loop in here

345
00:21:35,780 --> 00:21:40,850
saying for a Eagles on the moment is the
slow them if you only want to talk to

346
00:21:40,850 --> 00:21:42,970
one LED the time

347
00:21:42,970 --> 00:21:46,040
I've gotta send the number out one do
for

348
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:49,060
8 16 32 64 what are those numbers

349
00:21:49,060 --> 00:21:54,179
now is it too so when I gotta do is say
el print

350
00:21:54,180 --> 00:21:57,860
to do the 0 which is one

351
00:21:57,860 --> 00:22:01,660
to do that first which is to

352
00:22:01,660 --> 00:22:05,230
for the 1632 so if you were to rate

353
00:22:05,230 --> 00:22:08,230
this lie naked and I'm not gonna take
the time to type in I

354
00:22:08,230 --> 00:22:11,390
I don't find that this could have all
these things on this with

355
00:22:11,390 --> 00:22:15,610
I think you get the idea now I can wait
one at a time so by choosing the correct

356
00:22:15,610 --> 00:22:17,760
numbers and if you want to remember the
math

357
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:21,629
make a little rain stick the numbers and
then just keep calm the rain

358
00:22:21,630 --> 00:22:27,160
you can send them out in control anyone
who's LED's in any combination you want

359
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:30,870
movement to do just that

360
00:22:30,870 --> 00:22:35,530
instead it just doing regular LED's was
a plan especially the

361
00:22:35,530 --> 00:22:39,850
and I try new things you can either buy
in the store your flea market in get

362
00:22:39,850 --> 00:22:43,310
because they're cheap you want the real
cheap things as the seven

363
00:22:43,310 --> 00:22:47,940
segment display this is nothing but
LED's and they're in the shape of the

364
00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:48,750
figure eight

365
00:22:48,750 --> 00:22:51,960
and they're always labeled shipping

366
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:56,580
me gay they are always

367
00:22:56,580 --> 00:23:01,909
labeled I see it the ABCDE

368
00:23:01,910 --> 00:23:05,240
FG their always labeled in that sequence

369
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:09,670
so these LED segments always had the
same letter

370
00:23:09,670 --> 00:23:13,490
and when you buy a cheap buddhism laser

371
00:23:13,490 --> 00:23:17,640
okay no I like to point to the sad face
the audience instead of the screen

372
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:21,050
thanks um when you buy an LED

373
00:23:21,050 --> 00:23:24,919
display seven segment display they might
be in different sequences are different

374
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:29,960
patterns both sockets but the sake we'll
be lil always be labeled on the

375
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:30,480
schematic

376
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:35,090
abcd to me which one they go to where so
you can always get the same results

377
00:23:35,090 --> 00:23:39,639
in all I've done is connected one line
to each one of these LED's

378
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:42,810
and I can then like them

379
00:23:42,810 --> 00:23:47,669
from my computer now the reason the

380
00:23:47,670 --> 00:23:51,670
on the buffers in there is because

381
00:23:51,670 --> 00:23:57,850
when this goes low the voltage we go
from five wats the ground then that

382
00:23:57,850 --> 00:24:00,600
would lights in with only when its low
and I don't want that

383
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:03,910
so this little buffer turns everything
upside-down it's called an inverter

384
00:24:03,910 --> 00:24:07,990
and now instead of going low and
lighting

385
00:24:07,990 --> 00:24:12,360
when this goes my this guy is lower than
it does with school sink it since the

386
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:12,890
current

387
00:24:12,890 --> 00:24:18,440
and what happens is d it jean-juste the
circuits do a lot better sinking

388
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:21,679
and circuit diagram that supplying from
golds

389
00:24:21,679 --> 00:24:26,690
so we try and sync things the way this
is I'm going from Graham through here

390
00:24:26,690 --> 00:24:30,380
through the LED and then the rivals and
we're sinking the current

391
00:24:30,380 --> 00:24:33,720
unlike the next that's as deep as you
have to get the day

392
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:36,950
and then there's a resistor in series
with that and the reason we have

393
00:24:36,950 --> 00:24:39,660
resistors so we don't put too much
electricity through here

394
00:24:39,660 --> 00:24:44,330
and burning up my LED the LED a burn
before the TTL certainly will burn

395
00:24:44,330 --> 00:24:47,939
so that's the limit and protect the LED
very sensitive

396
00:24:47,940 --> 00:24:52,080
okay what else can we run well

397
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:57,159
you can now buy liquid crystal displays
for them out five to ten books

398
00:24:57,160 --> 00:25:01,510
and I think you know to put in the book
a circuit for them and I want you to see

399
00:25:01,510 --> 00:25:05,160
it's very complicating me hope you can
appreciate this

400
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:09,880
but there's the whole circuit that's a
liquid crystal display

401
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:14,250
that's your computer and this is a
fifty-cent park or they sip

402
00:25:14,250 --> 00:25:18,620
single in willing package it's just a
buncha resistors

403
00:25:18,620 --> 00:25:22,530
and it's just one little thing and when
it's in the circuit Woodley this way

404
00:25:22,530 --> 00:25:25,500
but the Droid in the schematic we do
this way cuz we didn't like this are

405
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:26,570
looking a mess

406
00:25:26,570 --> 00:25:29,879
so you like this but that's just one
little piece a place that it was fifty

407
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:32,390
cents in its leave cross the wires

408
00:25:32,390 --> 00:25:36,450
and connected each one of them and does
anyone know why you use this is gonna

409
00:25:36,450 --> 00:25:38,530
pull up resistor designing no I use both

410
00:25:38,530 --> 00:25:41,610
resistors anybody at all what do they do

411
00:25:41,610 --> 00:25:46,080
yes sir it would be hell yes analyzed

412
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:49,090
yes it makes a bigger cleaner signal

413
00:25:49,090 --> 00:25:52,760
and so with the if the wire from your
computer to you this play is over about

414
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:53,980
six inches

415
00:25:53,980 --> 00:25:57,360
this makes it a much clearer signal so
we're going from 5 votes to ground

416
00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:58,830
instead of from

417
00:25:58,830 --> 00:26:02,139
rivals the tuning in full swing

418
00:26:02,140 --> 00:26:05,429
yes exactly the signal to noise ratios
less

419
00:26:05,429 --> 00:26:09,179
so this is a fifty-cent partners in here
and now I can sing to me into this

420
00:26:09,179 --> 00:26:13,160
and I can really go crystal display
because at the time when I can do that

421
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:13,810
today but

422
00:26:13,810 --> 00:26:18,270
may have that one the board

423
00:26:18,270 --> 00:26:22,750
okay to put off the board highlighted
know that the liquid crystal display or

424
00:26:22,750 --> 00:26:25,500
the neat thing is that every liquid
crystal display

425
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:29,950
up the two lines are 40 characters uses
the same chip to make it work

426
00:26:29,950 --> 00:26:33,300
in the old wire to your computer the
same way see you can make a little a

427
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:36,140
group is this plane you doing a science
fair project

428
00:26:36,140 --> 00:26:38,990
you put a little bit so this way on the
table you don't have to leave at an

429
00:26:38,990 --> 00:26:40,910
expensive monitor

430
00:26:40,910 --> 00:26:44,500
no one's going to break anything with
anything

431
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:48,570
getting and there's two ways that the
makin actors but they both use the same

432
00:26:48,570 --> 00:26:49,678
numbering scheme

433
00:26:49,679 --> 00:26:55,970
everything's always the same let's look
at some other things then

434
00:26:55,970 --> 00:26:57,850
other things you can out with or

435
00:26:57,850 --> 00:27:01,880
musical tones much known signals you
make speech

436
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:05,500
makes sign lease pulse width modulation

437
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:10,470
this musical tone is kinda neat not to
show you that

438
00:27:10,470 --> 00:27:15,010
and because the time limits I'm not
going to 18 I don't think we had

439
00:27:15,010 --> 00:27:18,040
no I didn't bring the circuit so we
won't do that

440
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:22,840
the last thing you can do is drive
things that have a lot of power to them

441
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:27,360
here is a computer there's a there's
pull-up resistors

442
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:31,360
and this is a buffer this is really need
these things cause the bed 80 cents

443
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:34,780
in 1999 be glued to it like the relay

444
00:27:34,780 --> 00:27:38,899
then really might take any amp I'm here
theme

445
00:27:38,900 --> 00:27:44,050
million $50 million set my computer this
thing place a teeny weeny signaling

446
00:27:44,050 --> 00:27:45,879
makes it strong but it does something
else

447
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:48,980
if anybody ever work with the really
they know there's a thing go back EMF

448
00:27:48,980 --> 00:27:49,770
thicken

449
00:27:49,770 --> 00:27:53,230
store the energy in the field and it
makes a magnetic field and then when you

450
00:27:53,230 --> 00:27:54,310
turn off the power

451
00:27:54,310 --> 00:27:57,530
all their magnetic energy shoots rate
back you

452
00:27:57,530 --> 00:28:02,460
you circuit and you get a sporty that's
good the back EMF

453
00:28:02,460 --> 00:28:05,600
this little thing for 50 cents

454
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:10,930
do dollar as protection in too short the
back EMF degree and

455
00:28:10,930 --> 00:28:14,420
so that it does not affect your computer
you can run the C loads

456
00:28:14,420 --> 00:28:17,520
in the course with the real you to run a
much bigger load

457
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:22,800
for instance you could use this circuit
then again we do see 0.22 the first open

458
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:23,700
to the second

459
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:26,790
and I can make anyone in these things
working ready really they want

460
00:28:26,790 --> 00:28:31,240
I can't make this really and they could
be switches on HO train layout me

461
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:34,640
I am this could be the switch

462
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:37,710
the on your garage door opener so

463
00:28:37,710 --> 00:28:41,430
your computer could turn your when you
call in or whatever you can have your

464
00:28:41,430 --> 00:28:43,010
computer will be your garage door

465
00:28:43,010 --> 00:28:46,190
we could also be a relay that goes to

466
00:28:46,190 --> 00:28:50,300
the coffee pot and when the computer
which is using your fax machine in your

467
00:28:50,300 --> 00:28:55,820
digital Voice mail system at 7:30 in the
morning it's not what it's doing it

468
00:28:55,820 --> 00:28:57,020
closes a contact

469
00:28:57,020 --> 00:29:01,050
you call the state's brewing and then
you have this frozen breakfast with him

470
00:29:01,050 --> 00:29:01,710
in a zine

471
00:29:01,710 --> 00:29:04,960
it makes that in the microwave and
everything to be done automatically

472
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:09,120
not healthy but works the mckinney

473
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:12,920
so these are pictures of different
relays in case you're only what they

474
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:13,930
don't want to be

475
00:29:13,930 --> 00:29:17,340
me there's a very special relay

476
00:29:17,340 --> 00:29:22,510
very special really you know what

477
00:29:22,510 --> 00:29:26,370
you know what's in this really a little
tiny LED just like we were using here

478
00:29:26,370 --> 00:29:27,900
there's a little LED in this

479
00:29:27,900 --> 00:29:32,000
no way because when you send out an open
command

480
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:35,290
this LED goes on and it sends a little
light beam

481
00:29:35,290 --> 00:29:39,750
too little transistor that sensitive to
light in you talking on a light beam

482
00:29:39,750 --> 00:29:40,830
between the

483
00:29:40,830 --> 00:29:44,970
low-power and high-power in the high
power in the next to your

484
00:29:44,970 --> 00:29:49,820
the plugs in the wall so in fact here's
a solid state relay and I'm operating on

485
00:29:49,820 --> 00:29:51,600
110 volt a blender

486
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:55,220
usually I bring a Sabres on a plug it in
break here

487
00:29:55,220 --> 00:29:58,860
musee solid state relay

488
00:29:58,860 --> 00:30:04,810
and the the the little

489
00:30:04,810 --> 00:30:08,679
black plastic thing with the four leads
that's the solid state relay

490
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:12,070
what's really need about it he already
has a heatsink on it

491
00:30:12,070 --> 00:30:15,600
it already has an LED and not the couple
on it

492
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:19,090
so you can run 200 amp circuits

493
00:30:19,090 --> 00:30:22,780
like the lights in a movie theater you
wanna do a stage production the new

494
00:30:22,780 --> 00:30:23,389
church

495
00:30:23,390 --> 00:30:26,970
you just 110 these things to each these
beans

496
00:30:26,970 --> 00:30:31,540
you know the different colored things
running and these release list for about

497
00:30:31,540 --> 00:30:32,940
20-25 bucks

498
00:30:32,940 --> 00:30:36,950
you can get them in a flea market from a
dollar to two dollars if you do with

499
00:30:36,950 --> 00:30:37,310
soap

500
00:30:37,310 --> 00:30:40,540
like a hamfest my computer then share a
lecture in

501
00:30:40,540 --> 00:30:44,300
computer that's the wall or which is
near here when the others

502
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:48,110
so the very popular theory Martin

503
00:30:48,110 --> 00:30:51,820
easy to get and they're very safe if
you're running NEC load

504
00:30:51,820 --> 00:30:55,210
you have to use a solid million up the
couple you do

505
00:30:55,210 --> 00:30:58,860
run that directly from your computer
yeah

506
00:30:58,860 --> 00:31:02,060
me just snow been

507
00:31:02,060 --> 00:31:06,060
you know what's going on some okay

508
00:31:06,060 --> 00:31:09,270
that's for one coming up the couple any

509
00:31:09,270 --> 00:31:13,490
something that makes the with which you
you didn't you need assistance

510
00:31:13,490 --> 00:31:16,750
nevermind the other thing you can
control

511
00:31:16,750 --> 00:31:22,370
I cut this down because at the time
limitation on well just the other thing

512
00:31:22,370 --> 00:31:25,940
you teach role as motors and the very
popular motor is a stepping motor

513
00:31:25,940 --> 00:31:30,929
want stepping motor is radio there's a
little when

514
00:31:30,929 --> 00:31:35,260
and perhaps if we have time at the end
that blue that program again you're just

515
00:31:35,260 --> 00:31:36,100
saying help breed

516
00:31:36,100 --> 00:31:40,270
1&2 3&4 and this thing is for wind
things

517
00:31:40,270 --> 00:31:45,400
you're controlling the four winds but a
very special suits stepping motor

518
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:48,790
is good by Paul what that means is

519
00:31:48,790 --> 00:31:52,310
i cant send electricity in this
direction

520
00:31:52,310 --> 00:31:55,530
and I can send in the other direction in
this thing move

521
00:31:55,530 --> 00:32:00,540
in increments each time the reason by
police are so much more popular than the

522
00:32:00,540 --> 00:32:02,570
kind that have 40 innings when used to

523
00:32:02,570 --> 00:32:06,379
is because the you're using four times
as much power

524
00:32:06,380 --> 00:32:09,770
to run as one that has one winding love
for one thing at once

525
00:32:09,770 --> 00:32:12,889
hear music all the wine is all the time
seeking a lot more strength from a

526
00:32:12,890 --> 00:32:14,740
little motor

527
00:32:14,740 --> 00:32:18,290
most people do not publish circuits for
this because the the circuit requires

528
00:32:18,290 --> 00:32:22,260
that you use bipolar circuitry in people
don't realize

529
00:32:22,260 --> 00:32:26,510
you get that whole thing on one little
chip one doing years in the note the

530
00:32:26,510 --> 00:32:30,660
binary numbers 0- 12 30 1230 123

531
00:32:30,660 --> 00:32:34,830
and this thing goes through its were
combinations automatically from this jet

532
00:32:34,830 --> 00:32:38,379
and some some amusing to be at stake in
it three more these things

533
00:32:38,380 --> 00:32:41,780
United 93 more step in the second before
stepping motors from one

534
00:32:41,780 --> 00:32:45,210
parallel printer port very very safely

535
00:32:45,210 --> 00:32:49,220
this thing supplies the plus and minus
in the world each reversals and it even

536
00:32:49,220 --> 00:32:51,260
has its own building heatsink

537
00:32:51,260 --> 00:32:55,300
didn't you dissipate heat see their own
stepping on me know why stepping what

538
00:32:55,300 --> 00:33:00,230
you see when I give it does mean 0- 12
30 23 I know with the motor is

539
00:33:00,230 --> 00:33:05,030
you brainer knows where it is every time
it advances

540
00:33:05,030 --> 00:33:08,418
the paper that's because it's a stepping
motor that it means is it

541
00:33:08,419 --> 00:33:12,890
in it was so many steps the thing that
goes back in for this is that the motor

542
00:33:12,890 --> 00:33:17,130
any news weird is it goes back and forth
because it's going especially commit

543
00:33:17,130 --> 00:33:20,650
just to make sure they put a little LED
or something at the end

544
00:33:20,650 --> 00:33:24,300
know when it reaches the limit and they
send that information back to the key to

545
00:33:24,300 --> 00:33:25,700
you to know where to start

546
00:33:25,700 --> 00:33:29,660
the basically the ones without any
feedback that's why the Sony

547
00:33:29,660 --> 00:33:33,000
they're cheap these these goals three
four dollars

548
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:37,070
need controls about three four five
dollars you have anything to make a

549
00:33:37,070 --> 00:33:39,639
plotter you could make a robotic arm

550
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:43,790
you to replace the movies in a Lego set
and make something that you can really

551
00:33:43,790 --> 00:33:45,500
control

552
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:48,850
mckinney that's my stepping motors you
some neat

553
00:33:48,850 --> 00:33:52,970
the and here is one

554
00:33:52,970 --> 00:33:56,100
the most complicating circuits

555
00:33:56,100 --> 00:34:01,090
no the I will show some more things
demonstrating we do inputs

556
00:34:01,090 --> 00:34:04,720
this is one of the most sophisticated
and most difficult circuits that I put

557
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:06,419
in my book

558
00:34:06,419 --> 00:34:10,260
isn't that complicating 0 yes it is

559
00:34:10,260 --> 00:34:14,540
this is those little remote control
motors they use a model airplanes

560
00:34:14,540 --> 00:34:18,190
and in Boots when you send the rule
joystick you

561
00:34:18,190 --> 00:34:22,480
you set the position at this motor this
motor only goes between zero

562
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:27,149
and eighty 180 degrees its conserving
motor

563
00:34:27,149 --> 00:34:31,379
now to make that sucker do that that's a
DC motor to make that suckered into a

564
00:34:31,379 --> 00:34:32,770
position and stay there

565
00:34:32,770 --> 00:34:36,759
is not an easy task is a matter fact its
ok complicating the

566
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:40,620
inside a year is a large-scale
immigration circuit

567
00:34:40,620 --> 00:34:44,679
the controls this thing it's really
complicated

568
00:34:44,679 --> 00:34:48,320
however I don't know any that because I
just by this route in 15 boats in a

569
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:49,200
gimmick that

570
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:54,109
boy Kinect is plus-5 alt ground any
signal to my parallel port

571
00:34:54,109 --> 00:34:57,680
now here we doing something else is and
the complicating and since

572
00:34:57,680 --> 00:35:01,259
this is so well again I'm going to just
doing the little detail what they did

573
00:35:01,260 --> 00:35:02,210
here

574
00:35:02,210 --> 00:35:07,280
did mean every single IBM there is a
timer

575
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:11,380
in every single I the end that time a
ship crews at the scene speed

576
00:35:11,380 --> 00:35:15,730
you gonna be Indian it's going at the
same speed as a bone the clues

577
00:35:15,730 --> 00:35:19,540
in XD it's the same chip with the same
time

578
00:35:19,540 --> 00:35:23,520
with the same clock speed so I went to
assembly language

579
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:27,560
and I figured out how long it would take
minute timer to read

580
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:31,150
one millisecond me

581
00:35:31,150 --> 00:35:35,970
you know when we take 3 100 the
millisecond

582
00:35:35,970 --> 00:35:39,670
this motor to run wants to see a signal

583
00:35:39,670 --> 00:35:43,210
will be for exactly

584
00:35:43,210 --> 00:35:46,800
point five milliseconds the to enhance
milliseconds

585
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:50,370
however long that signal is

586
00:35:50,370 --> 00:35:55,089
right and so obviously if I want to use
it and I don't see it

587
00:35:55,089 --> 00:35:58,759
that the signal is positive for

588
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:01,940
hit a millisecond that's the role with
the signals positive for tuning in

589
00:36:01,940 --> 00:36:04,250
milliseconds that some 180 degrees

590
00:36:04,250 --> 00:36:08,560
so now over along its up that's where
this thing goes and you have to repeat

591
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:10,299
it every 40 milliseconds

592
00:36:10,300 --> 00:36:14,970
this point five to tuning in
milliseconds

593
00:36:14,970 --> 00:36:18,320
repeated every 40 milliseconds and you
can't control this thing

594
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:21,650
we went to assembly thing is is the only
one in the book we went to assembly

595
00:36:21,650 --> 00:36:22,630
language

596
00:36:22,630 --> 00:36:28,150
so the circuit is only in Penn scale and
see it is not include basically

597
00:36:28,150 --> 00:36:31,600
and because we went and use the timer
chip

598
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:35,350
and went to similar language this
circuit will work on any IBM

599
00:36:35,350 --> 00:36:38,430
take computer regardless of what model
it is

600
00:36:38,430 --> 00:36:41,990
yes I know there and would you waste the
time the NSE

601
00:36:41,990 --> 00:36:45,640
but this one works on anything in with
one said

602
00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:49,960
I instructions okay now we're gonna look
it

603
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:53,700
it's something that's in this time I'm
going to be able to run something you're

604
00:36:53,700 --> 00:36:55,070
gonna like me

605
00:36:55,070 --> 00:36:59,359
I hope there are different kinds of
things you can run in the first is

606
00:36:59,359 --> 00:37:01,089
digital

607
00:37:01,089 --> 00:37:07,660
and I'm not going to may demonstrate
that we want to show you

608
00:37:07,660 --> 00:37:10,830
you parallel port on any IBM take
computer

609
00:37:10,830 --> 00:37:14,180
which is ninety-some percent of the
market is not one

610
00:37:14,180 --> 00:37:19,819
dress but three so this is where all the
data goes out that help me 12

611
00:37:19,820 --> 00:37:25,140
48 16 this is where it sends the
information to the computer

612
00:37:25,140 --> 00:37:28,210
papers now than ever

613
00:37:28,210 --> 00:37:32,270
you have my it's there you got another
four beats down here

614
00:37:32,270 --> 00:37:36,690
for other instructions so when the
simple ones that stick these top four

615
00:37:36,690 --> 00:37:42,510
and these low four we meet them in and
use a large construction coal work or

616
00:37:42,510 --> 00:37:46,700
known them together these foreign these
were misinformed let's aid

617
00:37:46,700 --> 00:37:50,520
I got a plaintiff information from these
foreign eastwood

618
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:55,259
guess what they got the bike company and
I got be controlling is going on

619
00:37:55,260 --> 00:38:00,250
I can rule the world with a parallel
port let's look at what you can do.

620
00:38:00,250 --> 00:38:07,250
whom means

621
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:13,310
yeah

622
00:38:13,310 --> 00:38:18,380
you could put a burglar alarm in your
hands gimme and with this burglar alarm

623
00:38:18,380 --> 00:38:19,250
in your nouns

624
00:38:19,250 --> 00:38:23,750
he goes to assist little metal cabinet
in the middle class and that is

625
00:38:23,750 --> 00:38:25,440
something he calls the police

626
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:30,760
cause the fire department whatever well
there's also what's called a dry contact

627
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:31,870
you name your

628
00:38:31,870 --> 00:38:35,480
and we can take the dry contact me here

629
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:40,250
and when the alarm goes off we can have
a clear that little

630
00:38:40,250 --> 00:38:43,380
in with no upward until the computer

631
00:38:43,380 --> 00:38:48,230
bingo there's an alarm and so I did that

632
00:38:48,230 --> 00:38:51,670
years the switch normally

633
00:38:51,670 --> 00:38:55,530
closed it's going to the printer port

634
00:38:55,530 --> 00:39:00,560
the me whenever you psychic even hi Kia
parts this great menu

635
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:04,020
we use a TSR know the TSR is

636
00:39:04,020 --> 00:39:08,530
you the hotkey in something pops up it's
another program in da snow when those

637
00:39:08,530 --> 00:39:12,280
and it pops up in it works Germany and
stay

638
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:15,500
resident this is a hardware

639
00:39:15,500 --> 00:39:19,280
interrupted her many in-state resident
I've seen it published in many places

640
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:20,380
and they never worked

641
00:39:20,380 --> 00:39:23,670
it took me one hour to rate this sucker

642
00:39:23,670 --> 00:39:27,030
in Pascal it took another week to get
you one in C

643
00:39:27,030 --> 00:39:31,180
and I know silly this is not be trivial
program

644
00:39:31,180 --> 00:39:35,290
what I've done is you push this button
and you got a fax don't mind you go

645
00:39:35,290 --> 00:39:36,080
please mail

646
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:40,440
and the alarm goes on when this which
opens computer stops what it's doing

647
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:41,820
from a hardware in the room

648
00:39:41,820 --> 00:39:46,610
and it does something else in my house I
have XD in

649
00:39:46,610 --> 00:39:49,960
things from radio shack on all the
lights in the hallway

650
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:54,630
and they all use the same period you
have an FM

651
00:39:54,630 --> 00:39:59,680
wireless intercom on every floor and i
connect that to my Sound Blaster

652
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:03,500
so that my computer can't walk through
the intercom

653
00:40:03,500 --> 00:40:07,690
when the alarm goes off and the police
have been notified

654
00:40:07,690 --> 00:40:12,330
the computer takes over and it starts
flashing all the lights in the walls

655
00:40:12,330 --> 00:40:17,410
and more the intercom start saying in a
computerized we salute pollute intruder

656
00:40:17,410 --> 00:40:18,460
is in the hills

657
00:40:18,460 --> 00:40:21,820
now if you are unsure what are you going
to do

658
00:40:21,820 --> 00:40:25,860
I think they leave in any way to heaven

659
00:40:25,860 --> 00:40:30,070
I live in a very nice neighborhood in
hasn't really been needed yet

660
00:40:30,070 --> 00:40:33,360
you love you love the fine the computer
to disconnect all this

661
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:36,870
me time it doesn't go off to the police
have already been notified so they know

662
00:40:36,870 --> 00:40:37,670
the Jags up

663
00:40:37,670 --> 00:40:42,470
in love with the leave without breaking
the windows but that's a terminate and

664
00:40:42,470 --> 00:40:43,960
stay resident use

665
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:47,560
on the idea is that your computers doing
one thing

666
00:40:47,560 --> 00:40:52,169
me to stop and do something else yeah

667
00:40:52,169 --> 00:40:53,879
then

668
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:59,179
you actually boom was when we did she
okay

669
00:40:59,179 --> 00:41:02,279
getting the engine yo

670
00:41:02,279 --> 00:41:05,749
you do real quick

671
00:41:05,749 --> 00:41:10,039
you can include all kinds of stuff you
couldn't with a buncha buttons now I

672
00:41:10,039 --> 00:41:13,219
know what you're thinking when it is
connected but no way to the printer port

673
00:41:13,219 --> 00:41:17,509
well the problem is buttons mechanical
buttons have what's called

674
00:41:17,509 --> 00:41:21,880
Herald you heard this before you know
all the right answers

675
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:26,519
he has bands when it closes the really
good really like this and then it closes

676
00:41:26,519 --> 00:41:30,119
induce which is not making a good
connection see you have to build the

677
00:41:30,119 --> 00:41:30,910
circuit

678
00:41:30,910 --> 00:41:34,410
the body belts the switches

679
00:41:34,410 --> 00:41:38,029
or you can buy a little chip
three-dollar lousy template

680
00:41:38,029 --> 00:41:41,869
sixteen year and another 16 if you have
one little transistor

681
00:41:41,869 --> 00:41:46,929
and all the 16 inputs then become a
binary number in the coming into the

682
00:41:46,929 --> 00:41:47,429
room

683
00:41:47,429 --> 00:41:52,150
word so I can read a whole keep net now
you got a science fair project instead

684
00:41:52,150 --> 00:41:54,109
of putting your keyboard on the table

685
00:41:54,109 --> 00:41:58,419
been letting someone break it right you
brit

686
00:41:58,419 --> 00:42:03,169
symbol approve micro switches out there
make them do a dollar chip

687
00:42:03,169 --> 00:42:06,999
room at a parallel port the computers
under the table the only thing on the

688
00:42:06,999 --> 00:42:08,789
table where these little buttons that
are

689
00:42:08,789 --> 00:42:11,880
bulletproof did and your liquid crystal
display

690
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:15,929
member the liquid crystal display and
now you can interact with a person

691
00:42:15,929 --> 00:42:20,880
and your computer doesn't get burned
that's my

692
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:24,619
we do these things another thing you can
do

693
00:42:24,619 --> 00:42:28,449
is read the position of things this is a
UN

694
00:42:28,449 --> 00:42:33,739
little LED it's in the light beam across
to worry a transistor that sensitive to

695
00:42:33,739 --> 00:42:34,249
light

696
00:42:34,249 --> 00:42:39,569
you can see the rate they're and one on
the science teachers in my school

697
00:42:39,569 --> 00:42:42,949
got one where the distance between years
about a quarter-inch

698
00:42:42,949 --> 00:42:46,439
you put that over your load and you can
measure your pulse

699
00:42:46,439 --> 00:42:51,348
no problem bed on-screen does that look
familiar

700
00:42:51,349 --> 00:42:55,009
you buy any these exercise machines they
too much about 20-30 bucks for this

701
00:42:55,009 --> 00:42:56,529
little thing the club's new year

702
00:42:56,529 --> 00:42:59,959
that's all it is it's a fifty-cent more
the

703
00:42:59,959 --> 00:43:03,759
mission to read the position a motor
with the speed motor

704
00:43:03,759 --> 00:43:08,209
you can read something and fenced its
billing all kinda stuff with a

705
00:43:08,209 --> 00:43:12,118
fifty-cent up the purple and that brings
us

706
00:43:12,119 --> 00:43:16,699
there's others ones that we can use but
the most interesting and when to

707
00:43:16,699 --> 00:43:18,339
demonstrate this I promise

708
00:43:18,339 --> 00:43:23,439
he simply analog I when the input a
temperature and when input voltage

709
00:43:23,439 --> 00:43:27,678
and to do that we believe this program
in I think you can see what I'm doing

710
00:43:27,679 --> 00:43:32,400
I'm seeing wit be me

711
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:37,109
supposed to sing the blue tiles nazis
download it now

712
00:43:37,109 --> 00:43:42,939
we left and went to load a program the
lab windows which is demonstrating

713
00:43:42,939 --> 00:43:43,799
outside

714
00:43:43,799 --> 00:43:48,839
you see how nice this is this program
course the thousand dollars

715
00:43:48,839 --> 00:43:53,869
but there is a student version which
they distribute under certain conditions

716
00:43:53,869 --> 00:43:54,659
for free

717
00:43:54,659 --> 00:43:58,329
the well me this reviews for free with
my book

718
00:43:58,329 --> 00:44:02,289
which was a very nice compliment and
this is a big program it takes to make

719
00:44:02,289 --> 00:44:03,239
some memory

720
00:44:03,239 --> 00:44:07,319
and it is now on the computer can you
see a cursor moving on the screen

721
00:44:07,319 --> 00:44:10,439
okay otherwise I look kinda stupid what
are you doing

722
00:44:10,439 --> 00:44:14,759
but I'm going to the file section I'm
going to lewd the final

723
00:44:14,759 --> 00:44:18,179
and I really program

724
00:44:18,179 --> 00:44:21,489
me and went along with it

725
00:44:21,489 --> 00:44:26,339
this is level in those notes being what
it is lab when those will work in basic

726
00:44:26,339 --> 00:44:31,380
and work in 10 scale and

727
00:44:31,380 --> 00:44:36,239
wanna get this little circuit and show
it to you working

728
00:44:36,239 --> 00:44:40,359
zone we gotta do is figure out where we
put it you

729
00:44:40,359 --> 00:44:43,459
then mumbling

730
00:44:43,459 --> 00:44:48,598
yeah okay here we go

731
00:44:48,599 --> 00:44:52,469
the this isn't the only reduce smoking

732
00:44:52,469 --> 00:44:56,759
I but a little prototype every circuit
in the book i dole prototype wat with

733
00:44:56,759 --> 00:44:58,299
RadioShack parts usually

734
00:44:58,299 --> 00:45:01,709
and then I tried it in a row the
software that I wrote a circuit using

735
00:45:01,709 --> 00:45:02,569
pads

736
00:45:02,569 --> 00:45:05,929
which again makes me here where student
version which is free

737
00:45:05,929 --> 00:45:10,949
and you can join circuits push a button
and you will not a circuit which were

738
00:45:10,949 --> 00:45:11,809
you

739
00:45:11,809 --> 00:45:15,150
be at home became

740
00:45:15,150 --> 00:45:20,189
bone plugs with that stuff

741
00:45:20,189 --> 00:45:25,299
and I got a little printer cable going
to my printer the when the plug in the

742
00:45:25,299 --> 00:45:25,989
circuit board

743
00:45:25,989 --> 00:45:31,860
was awesome

744
00:45:31,860 --> 00:45:35,630
you won't let me in because there's an
adapter you need me know we didn't

745
00:45:35,630 --> 00:45:42,630
boo here's the adapter rings

746
00:45:44,150 --> 00:45:47,559
me still make the someone hears I'm
sorry

747
00:45:47,559 --> 00:45:51,940
beheading a key will reach over you

748
00:45:51,940 --> 00:45:55,200
Jones okay

749
00:45:55,200 --> 00:45:58,910
but little circuit by the way no circuit

750
00:45:58,910 --> 00:46:02,359
the light design clothes more than
twenty dollars misnomer under 10

751
00:46:02,359 --> 00:46:05,598
and this circuit caused about four
dollars

752
00:46:05,599 --> 00:46:08,670
if you build circuits and I'm ongoing

753
00:46:08,670 --> 00:46:13,799
doing a little dance to you don't use
those little things with holes in it

754
00:46:13,799 --> 00:46:15,430
those white things you would do Y

755
00:46:15,430 --> 00:46:18,529
you drop it once on the floor and that's
the end of it

756
00:46:18,529 --> 00:46:21,979
the other problem is the only work up
the frequencies the audio

757
00:46:21,979 --> 00:46:26,279
if you're above audio 20,000 cycles it's
worthless

758
00:46:26,279 --> 00:46:29,719
with them you use wire wrap

759
00:46:29,719 --> 00:46:32,749
which is very expensive it is no good

760
00:46:32,749 --> 00:46:35,829
both audio so

761
00:46:35,829 --> 00:46:40,450
menu when I you work tonight look at the
data specs on a 2d converters they tell

762
00:46:40,450 --> 00:46:41,219
you don't

763
00:46:41,219 --> 00:46:45,489
wire at so you might get away with it
with the circuit but they're not

764
00:46:45,489 --> 00:46:46,559
designed for anything

765
00:46:46,559 --> 00:46:49,999
all those little wind things will get a
little bit of electoral

766
00:46:49,999 --> 00:46:55,680
will look good the lotion on them which
causes them to become a capacitor in all

767
00:46:55,680 --> 00:46:57,269
the sudden you go leakage currents

768
00:46:57,269 --> 00:47:01,219
okay this circuit caused by Boxwave 9

769
00:47:01,219 --> 00:47:04,410
is put a volume control on here

770
00:47:04,410 --> 00:47:07,739
and the financial make 025 all times

771
00:47:07,739 --> 00:47:11,259
and when you read that analog value

772
00:47:11,259 --> 00:47:14,709
into a little too ship because we're
dollars's

773
00:47:14,709 --> 00:47:18,379
it ADCO 804 that converted to binary

774
00:47:18,380 --> 00:47:22,339
he be its in the cable brings it into my
little laptop

775
00:47:22,339 --> 00:47:25,869
the and when I read that number and
display it on the screen

776
00:47:25,869 --> 00:47:29,039
why do I want to do a voltage well

777
00:47:29,039 --> 00:47:32,209
many chips are designed for under a
dollar

778
00:47:32,209 --> 00:47:37,459
they get the temperature you will divide
the temperature in dual voltage

779
00:47:37,459 --> 00:47:41,140
you can read a frequency and divided
into a voltage

780
00:47:41,140 --> 00:47:46,589
ninety you can take it resistance you
can take pressure

781
00:47:46,589 --> 00:47:50,078
all these things if you wanna do a
science experiment one reason the your

782
00:47:50,079 --> 00:47:50,690
computer

783
00:47:50,690 --> 00:47:54,619
read it in let's run the programs

784
00:47:54,619 --> 00:47:58,049
my guess that doesn't do it that this

785
00:47:58,049 --> 00:48:01,699
more than that one should do it this is
basic you can write this in basic urs

786
00:48:01,699 --> 00:48:03,059
see the same program

787
00:48:03,059 --> 00:48:06,670
I now have a beautiful little screen
this is lab

788
00:48:06,670 --> 00:48:11,109
mean those poor dogs I do not like when
does this is a dance program

789
00:48:11,109 --> 00:48:15,859
and Mike the mercer is over this this is
amusing a monochrome grant explored

790
00:48:15,859 --> 00:48:20,140
unfortunately there is no micro graphics
card in a laptop its me

791
00:48:20,140 --> 00:48:23,150
color computer cord so I have to switch

792
00:48:23,150 --> 00:48:26,380
to the printer port that comes with my
computer

793
00:48:26,380 --> 00:48:29,509
yeah I move this whole thing in and warm

794
00:48:29,509 --> 00:48:32,619
nail we're all in the teller

795
00:48:32,619 --> 00:48:37,489
grow its then report and we turn this
Diallo

796
00:48:37,489 --> 00:48:41,890
you should be seen the varying voltage
displayed as a voltage

797
00:48:41,890 --> 00:48:45,449
it's also being displayed in binary it's
also the

798
00:48:45,449 --> 00:48:49,819
displayed on the chart reader all those
things it's doing our

799
00:48:49,819 --> 00:48:52,949
icons this is the visual basically

800
00:48:52,949 --> 00:48:58,239
were that acquisition and this program
is a thousand dollars they make a

801
00:48:58,239 --> 00:49:00,989
student version which they allow me to
this treaty with the book

802
00:49:00,989 --> 00:49:06,440
and why it's so great is me to show you

803
00:49:06,440 --> 00:49:10,769
I made this in the morning an hour
because if I go to this

804
00:49:10,769 --> 00:49:14,799
window they could see the black unlike
the recent options

805
00:49:14,799 --> 00:49:18,499
your face and I'm going to loot the
screen

806
00:49:18,499 --> 00:49:21,949
show with the how easy it is so there is
a file

807
00:49:21,949 --> 00:49:27,269
the upper lil right left is your file
this movie its maintenance the love it

808
00:49:27,269 --> 00:49:30,799
alluded no alluded

809
00:49:30,799 --> 00:49:34,730
my analog

810
00:49:34,730 --> 00:49:36,910
munis a select begins

811
00:49:36,910 --> 00:49:41,460
this is the screen then I developed each
one of these is a variable

812
00:49:41,460 --> 00:49:45,630
that agree with the zero this michel de
Wallen

813
00:49:45,630 --> 00:49:50,160
is Michael noon and in fact this is
Justin

814
00:49:50,160 --> 00:49:53,950
in Aiken unit has a number

815
00:49:53,950 --> 00:49:57,550
and you tell it with the biggest number
you want to send it is you deal with the

816
00:49:57,550 --> 00:50:00,450
little this number you want to send it
is and its scale in

817
00:50:00,450 --> 00:50:04,450
the males I never rude online include it
knows when a man sees it knows how to

818
00:50:04,450 --> 00:50:05,340
read emails

819
00:50:05,340 --> 00:50:08,430
the program does everything

820
00:50:08,430 --> 00:50:11,970
so when you design a circuit where you
wanna control motor

821
00:50:11,970 --> 00:50:15,290
this light switch on the screen and when
you move the slide switch with your

822
00:50:15,290 --> 00:50:15,910
cursor

823
00:50:15,910 --> 00:50:21,069
you read that number in the motor work
you can control the speed from a

824
00:50:21,070 --> 00:50:21,880
beautiful

825
00:50:21,880 --> 00:50:25,260
in the graphical user interface Guri

826
00:50:25,260 --> 00:50:28,310
met with anything does 0

827
00:50:28,310 --> 00:50:35,310
so when I try to show the you in the
last couple minutes

828
00:50:35,580 --> 00:50:38,660
okay there is one other thing that's a
8-bit aided the

829
00:50:38,660 --> 00:50:42,770
I actually go as far as the channels
evaded the

830
00:50:42,770 --> 00:50:45,920
these are eight different voltages since
then having one little pot

831
00:50:45,920 --> 00:50:49,300
you could have eight knots en route to
relate

832
00:50:49,300 --> 00:50:52,820
temperatures will your fish tank you to
monitor water temperatures need little

833
00:50:52,820 --> 00:50:54,090
the emails between

834
00:50:54,090 --> 00:50:57,300
here and where you are is the chip 0

835
00:50:57,300 --> 00:51:01,400
report little but for which you really
don't need anything quoted

836
00:51:01,400 --> 00:51:05,730
oscillator in Ecorse mi dollars so for
about ten dollars you can build indeed

837
00:51:05,730 --> 00:51:11,450
channel EPA did the I have seen this in
real Electronix for $99.95

838
00:51:11,450 --> 00:51:15,930
from three different manufacturers with
circuit that's what they're selling in

839
00:51:15,930 --> 00:51:20,860
motivates is about eight to ten dollars
imports yep which you don't want to wrap

840
00:51:20,860 --> 00:51:21,360
it right

841
00:51:21,360 --> 00:51:25,180
the right because this is going at five
100

842
00:51:25,180 --> 00:51:29,750
thousand cycles

843
00:51:29,750 --> 00:51:33,060
a second wire app doesn't know me

844
00:51:33,060 --> 00:51:36,690
reliably ok any

845
00:51:36,690 --> 00:51:40,700
so when I try to do the not just do this

846
00:51:40,700 --> 00:51:46,050
real quick the years I've tried to show
you that there are different things the

847
00:51:46,050 --> 00:51:47,750
you can control with your computer

848
00:51:47,750 --> 00:51:50,900
you can include information you can help
with information

849
00:51:50,900 --> 00:51:54,820
you never have to open the hood all you
do is you plug into the

850
00:51:54,820 --> 00:51:58,070
printer port and by doing that you have

851
00:51:58,070 --> 00:52:02,480
very really high degree portability
going from one place to another

852
00:52:02,480 --> 00:52:07,380
very simplistic method it's very easy
and its reportable

853
00:52:07,380 --> 00:52:10,900
any language you what do you see even
see a scale

854
00:52:10,900 --> 00:52:15,010
basic blue ball if you're really a
masochist they all have minor

855
00:52:15,010 --> 00:52:18,310
control its main and them

856
00:52:18,310 --> 00:52:21,650
I I've tried to show you

857
00:52:21,650 --> 00:52:26,220
the simplicity is where the interfacing
niven talking for about 45 minutes

858
00:52:26,220 --> 00:52:31,510
does anybody have a question I know that
you're burning to say something yes sir

859
00:52:31,510 --> 00:52:38,510
the very good the only 2004 we get about
the in 1000 cycles per second

860
00:52:39,270 --> 00:52:42,690
you might have to go to assembly
language to realize that if you gonna do

861
00:52:42,690 --> 00:52:43,780
not display

862
00:52:43,780 --> 00:52:47,960
and I just finished an article for
microcomputer journal for november

863
00:52:47,960 --> 00:52:49,590
december I'm using a max

864
00:52:49,590 --> 00:52:54,050
one 50 500,000 cycles the

865
00:52:54,050 --> 00:52:59,100
samples assaying again with that you can
take digital audio you can read it in

866
00:52:59,100 --> 00:53:02,220
interview do with and save it and

867
00:53:02,220 --> 00:53:07,100
even have any also its 8-bit because the
250,000 site samples per second

868
00:53:07,100 --> 00:53:10,590
at that point you could have story or
wide whatever they call it you know

869
00:53:10,590 --> 00:53:13,970
surround sound you be recording the
whole thing in real time and see me in

870
00:53:13,970 --> 00:53:14,880
making your own

871
00:53:14,880 --> 00:53:19,110
I'm greetings the parallel port

872
00:53:19,110 --> 00:53:23,410
is whenever you hear the ratings are for
cereal multiply it by 10

873
00:53:23,410 --> 00:53:26,450
and that's what it is repairable because
you really

874
00:53:26,450 --> 00:53:29,950
all in at once me instead with 11 bits
and streams

875
00:53:29,950 --> 00:53:34,070
any other questions we do have a couple
minutes yes

876
00:53:34,070 --> 00:53:40,440
buried in the back me

877
00:53:40,440 --> 00:53:42,950
the

878
00:53:42,950 --> 00:53:47,609
the million that was one of the beauties
your you had a good

879
00:53:47,609 --> 00:53:50,970
that's a good question I'm sorry I
didn't then

880
00:53:50,970 --> 00:53:54,470
you know I was so wants to get here and
I don't doubt that was a very important

881
00:53:54,470 --> 00:53:55,800
concept thank you

882
00:53:55,800 --> 00:54:00,990
this is a beautiful and elegance and
simplicity how easy it is the talk to

883
00:54:00,990 --> 00:54:01,579
the printer

884
00:54:01,579 --> 00:54:06,390
the computer when you say el print
thinks it's talking to a printer another

885
00:54:06,390 --> 00:54:08,170
German ever use that use belted

886
00:54:08,170 --> 00:54:13,070
you can do that is you no what the
address is in the gets little when you

887
00:54:13,070 --> 00:54:15,820
input you have to use the ALP in the
impt

888
00:54:15,820 --> 00:54:21,339
what I did said was to you see this all
a resistor here

889
00:54:21,339 --> 00:54:26,290
and there's another one I think
somewhere 0 this technology pin I'm so

890
00:54:26,290 --> 00:54:27,200
it's over here

891
00:54:27,200 --> 00:54:31,010
years the other reasons do these
resistors cost about two cents and i

892
00:54:31,010 --> 00:54:33,030
connect these two lines the ground

893
00:54:33,030 --> 00:54:36,730
and by doing that the computer thinks
it's talking to a printer

894
00:54:36,730 --> 00:54:40,849
you need at two little resistors and two
wires or shorted to ground

895
00:54:40,849 --> 00:54:44,700
and at that point when you say el print
the computer thinks its own line and it

896
00:54:44,700 --> 00:54:45,560
has paper

897
00:54:45,560 --> 00:54:50,259
and there's no errors in all those lines
are corrected any other questions

898
00:54:50,260 --> 00:54:53,710
yes sir boom

899
00:54:53,710 --> 00:54:56,849
min four minutes it will be one hour

900
00:54:56,849 --> 00:55:02,400
thank you yes sir bomb

901
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:07,400
yeah the LM and 120 34 know they make
temperature

902
00:55:07,400 --> 00:55:11,359
you can buy a temperature sensor that is
near and its

903
00:55:11,359 --> 00:55:16,660
10 millivolts verdigris and they give a
calibrated

904
00:55:16,660 --> 00:55:21,160
in centigrade more than a its in galvin
and with the be

905
00:55:21,160 --> 00:55:24,308
it's Ian mean in Fahrenheit

906
00:55:24,309 --> 00:55:30,210
and they're all about about the many
other questions need to know and thats

907
00:55:30,210 --> 00:55:33,849
I don't women at the same room 134 234
in 334

908
00:55:33,849 --> 00:55:40,849
any other questions the other thank you
yes sir

909
00:55:45,090 --> 00:55:46,630
the

910
00:55:46,630 --> 00:55:49,940
yes

911
00:55:49,940 --> 00:55:51,520
I'll

912
00:55:51,520 --> 00:55:55,500
that's right you're bringing in the
eight bullets almost says that knowledge

913
00:55:55,500 --> 00:55:56,860
busy paper select

914
00:55:56,860 --> 00:56:00,300
ever in it you had nine in with lines

915
00:56:00,300 --> 00:56:05,210
units you really reading it in to
nibbles and at times you reading in four

916
00:56:05,210 --> 00:56:05,750
bits

917
00:56:05,750 --> 00:56:08,850
in five minutes so it's a teeny weeny
bit slower

918
00:56:08,850 --> 00:56:11,940
then all at once some other

919
00:56:11,940 --> 00:56:15,300
portables of course no by directional
points but that doesn't matter

920
00:56:15,300 --> 00:56:19,140
so it's a little bit slow but it's still
a lot faster than cereal

921
00:56:19,140 --> 00:56:22,180
and a lot less money to build the
converters

922
00:56:22,180 --> 00:56:27,860
yes

923
00:56:27,860 --> 00:56:30,530
microcontroller to

924
00:56:30,530 --> 00:56:34,530
what what book i neva what do you mean
by my group

925
00:56:34,530 --> 00:56:38,210
you didn't you could

926
00:56:38,210 --> 00:56:42,750
you what we in the media remote or
something yes the motor

927
00:56:42,750 --> 00:56:46,680
microcontroller I get my show a chip
that does that mean you just use for

928
00:56:46,680 --> 00:56:48,110
those chips and you talkin

929
00:56:48,110 --> 00:56:52,940
three to four dollars a chip is he the
one for stepping motors

930
00:56:52,940 --> 00:56:57,490
me about fifteen dollars in points its

931
00:56:57,490 --> 00:57:02,740
Milegi okay I I started late but I think
they want to start on time and I

932
00:57:02,740 --> 00:57:03,410
apologize

933
00:57:03,410 --> 00:57:07,240
I will really thank you I appreciate
your patience

934
00:57:07,240 --> 00:57:12,890
space

935
00:57:12,890 --> 00:57:13,940
home
