1
00:00:00,199 --> 00:00:04,720
bones

2
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:08,000
good afternoon everybody only yeah

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,210
okay my name is Mike Johnston and I'm

4
00:00:11,210 --> 00:00:15,330
the owner of most telecommunication
publisher Road that's like a

5
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:16,880
professional in its products

6
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:23,000
and then delete accordingly thankyou the
organizers invited me here today to

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,750
speak just a little bit about when it's
and what it is

8
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:30,599
what it does and what my company does
that mostly I think because everyone

9
00:00:30,599 --> 00:00:33,899
else is known as either in California
fans

10
00:00:33,899 --> 00:00:37,260
mom I first discovered minutes

11
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:41,050
abouts a year and a half ago on the
Internet

12
00:00:41,050 --> 00:00:45,690
and I was initially fairly skeptical
about its usability because

13
00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:49,780
in there are an awful lot of things out
there that have a lot of promise but

14
00:00:49,780 --> 00:00:52,090
usually don't pay enough to be with
their own room

15
00:00:52,090 --> 00:00:57,020
touted today well got a pretty good
background in system administration

16
00:00:57,020 --> 00:01:01,710
work with the Nets system by BST and see
on sale for itself

17
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:05,650
I pretty much knew it was involved in
putting one of those systems together

18
00:01:05,650 --> 00:01:09,560
home and that i spose was the basis of
my skepticism but

19
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:14,170
nevertheless I downloaded a copy of the
original song planning system version

20
00:01:14,170 --> 00:01:18,290
of the Internet and I was still fairly
surprised

21
00:01:18,290 --> 00:01:21,720
%uh it was a very complete system it

22
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:25,270
essentially had all the features that I
was used to

23
00:01:25,270 --> 00:01:29,250
in standard versions of Unix the
compilers with their

24
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:34,320
X Windows and development libraries in
almost the other Internet tools which

25
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:35,520
has been around for

26
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:38,890
you know years were already compiled the
running on Linux so

27
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:42,270
essentially it was a very complete
version the operating system

28
00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:46,390
and I was surprised said least

29
00:01:46,390 --> 00:01:50,710
so I started I started by putting it on
floppy disks because at the time I think

30
00:01:50,710 --> 00:01:52,200
it was about that

31
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:56,520
30 discs worth yourself which was even
then still quite a handful

32
00:01:56,520 --> 00:02:00,090
especially if you only have a 96 on a
boat connection to the Internet soon to

33
00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:00,729
tell

34
00:02:00,729 --> 00:02:04,270
so little did I know what I was getting
myself into

35
00:02:04,270 --> 00:02:07,689
because my phone started ringing in the
next thing I knew I was copying

36
00:02:07,689 --> 00:02:10,039
thousands a floppy disks by hand

37
00:02:10,039 --> 00:02:13,520
they didn't have any duplicating
equipment sales

38
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:17,020
or anything and i were quite a number a
floppy drives in the process

39
00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:21,800
a little later on I decided to start
putting on CD-rom

40
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:26,069
and you not having ever put anything on
CD-rom

41
00:02:26,069 --> 00:02:30,209
and not knowing how to do it didn't
really stop me um

42
00:02:30,209 --> 00:02:33,800
me just say that if you you really
haven't lived until you've

43
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:37,840
put something on a nunnery civil media
and spent the last two thousand dollars

44
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:38,450
doing it

45
00:02:38,450 --> 00:02:42,349
that nevertheless it worked

46
00:02:42,349 --> 00:02:46,290
and i learn pretty quickly how to do
that's all we have any probs their CDs

47
00:02:46,290 --> 00:02:46,959
simple

48
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:51,160
and that's essentially help my company
most telecommunication got its the

49
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:55,950
level in its publishing business well a
little later on I decided that I i felt

50
00:02:55,950 --> 00:02:57,560
the operating system was ready

51
00:02:57,560 --> 00:03:00,730
pretty much ready for prime time it

52
00:03:00,730 --> 00:03:03,970
needed better documentation at least a
more coherent package

53
00:03:03,970 --> 00:03:08,129
be made available to to the general use
a rather than just the Internet

54
00:03:08,129 --> 00:03:12,340
connected techie so what we did was we
contacted

55
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:15,530
Patrick talking the the author of
Slackware

56
00:03:15,530 --> 00:03:19,680
most likely limit switches currently the
most popular version of Linux so

57
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:24,510
available on the Internet and we propose
to him that what we would do would be to

58
00:03:24,510 --> 00:03:27,739
basically create an official
distribution I'll

59
00:03:27,739 --> 00:03:32,730
the Slackware input on CD-rom provided
documentation

60
00:03:32,730 --> 00:03:36,230
and technical support which is which is
something I think

61
00:03:36,230 --> 00:03:41,159
a most people generally expects when the
when they spend $50 or $75 dollars

62
00:03:41,159 --> 00:03:42,340
whatever for pre

63
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:45,459
created distribution which is what we
did

64
00:03:45,459 --> 00:03:49,510
so well taking it from there he jumped
at the idea

65
00:03:49,510 --> 00:03:53,359
and that was house like worry
professionals like a professional

66
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:55,030
products was born

67
00:03:55,030 --> 00:03:58,930
slack with professional is essentially

68
00:03:58,930 --> 00:04:02,650
the same version I'll lyrics that you
can get

69
00:04:02,650 --> 00:04:07,439
on the Internet the key differences with
that packages that you can run it

70
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:11,709
directly from the cd-rom and run it
cleanly with using as little as

71
00:04:11,709 --> 00:04:16,108
eight megabytes other native Linux
partition or 11 megabytes

72
00:04:16,108 --> 00:04:21,870
all the nine compressed MS DOS partition
the book the rest the operating system X

73
00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:22,710
Windows

74
00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:26,070
the internets don't the compilers and
all run from CDM course

75
00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:29,870
the faster the cd-rom drive you have the
better you know one start compiling

76
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:32,960
kernels with a single speed cd-rom drive

77
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:38,380
moms so that's a that's what we did we
put that together with the

78
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:42,060
the manuals which has been written by
the Linux documentation projects

79
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:46,540
I have been professionally printed in
tights that home

80
00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:50,979
decided to beef up our tech support a
little bit at the National Alliance

81
00:04:50,979 --> 00:04:54,060
mmm and basically when pressed the

82
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:58,660
5,000 m2 starred as a right now the
thing is

83
00:04:58,660 --> 00:05:03,460
the moving up faster than we can even
imagine I i cant

84
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:07,840
even begin to guess guess the number
abuses that are

85
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:11,070
are currently using minutes actively
whether that's

86
00:05:11,070 --> 00:05:14,690
that the 1200 1000 it's all over the
place

87
00:05:14,690 --> 00:05:20,660
and sense there's no unified sources
getting any you can get in anywhere you

88
00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:23,610
want and you don't have to register when
you get it

89
00:05:23,610 --> 00:05:27,530
the who knows there could be a
quarter-million I'm estimates range from

90
00:05:27,530 --> 00:05:30,259
100,000 200,000 barrels

91
00:05:30,259 --> 00:05:33,449
but it's all over the place and

92
00:05:33,449 --> 00:05:36,860
you'll find it all over the place so

93
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:40,850
it's out there and what that we do
basically is we

94
00:05:40,850 --> 00:05:43,990
you provide on CD-rom we updated
frequently

95
00:05:43,990 --> 00:05:48,100
we try and track the birds' that we
discover through the customers the call

96
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:48,680
us

97
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:53,160
Laura for assistance put those back the
developers

98
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:56,940
much Ryan and get the documentation
enhance the

99
00:05:56,940 --> 00:06:01,350
the aspect to the installation that have
problems we we tend to

100
00:06:01,350 --> 00:06:04,410
a result those difficulties by first
determining

101
00:06:04,410 --> 00:06:08,660
whether or not it was the user that
maybe did something wrong

102
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:12,449
up with these inflation process itself

103
00:06:12,449 --> 00:06:16,009
and from there we communicate that back
to the developers

104
00:06:16,009 --> 00:06:19,990
and essentially act as a buffer between
the developers

105
00:06:19,990 --> 00:06:23,400
the in the end users so that they don't
have to be answering thousands of

106
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:24,319
questions because

107
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:29,490
as the installed base and Linux users
grows with finding that

108
00:06:29,490 --> 00:06:33,000
the developers more and ourselves as
well or getting

109
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,000
literally hundreds of email messages a
day and that's

110
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,460
the continued to grow so similarly

111
00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:42,530
we thought was partially remove the
burden up support

112
00:06:42,530 --> 00:06:46,680
pump at VocaLink the author it's like
we're real these pretty much of chasing

113
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:48,729
the grateful that are in Chicago these
days

114
00:06:48,729 --> 00:06:54,389
means I for those who are interested bob
bob Union publisher of The

115
00:06:54,389 --> 00:06:58,419
New York units and the owner the ACC
bookstore has a table set up

116
00:06:58,419 --> 00:07:01,680
out the area where we can take a look at
the slack with pro

117
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:05,650
products as well as some the other
limits related products that he's got

118
00:07:05,650 --> 00:07:06,590
the implemented

119
00:07:06,590 --> 00:07:11,720
literally books and so forth percent
they seem to spend most of my time these

120
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:14,410
days answering questions on the
telephone I really haven't had the

121
00:07:14,410 --> 00:07:15,199
chance to print

122
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:18,699
to prepare anything along with the bore
you with today

123
00:07:18,699 --> 00:07:22,580
that's so at this point you know open
the floor room will take questions about

124
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:24,650
next what it is that my firm does

125
00:07:24,650 --> 00:07:29,180
maybe have some technical expressions or
what have you and

126
00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:33,630
sodium his sons yeah I'm

127
00:07:33,630 --> 00:07:37,000
medication

128
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:41,420
the mosaic unfortunately is not free
software

129
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:46,840
the NCSA doesn't want to be distributed
on CD rom without world is being paid

130
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:48,620
back to the incidence that

131
00:07:48,620 --> 00:07:51,740
we're currently working on licensing
that

132
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:55,230
for the CD but at this time it's not on
the CD because at that

133
00:07:55,230 --> 00:07:58,440
there is a go for replacements called
links

134
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:03,030
which I actually think it's quite that
early the original goal for programs

135
00:08:03,030 --> 00:08:05,240
that's on this he had go to services

136
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:08,220
yeah

137
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:12,900
stimulation home

138
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:16,229
okay there is dust DOS emulator on a
cold awesome you

139
00:08:16,229 --> 00:08:19,770
Windows emulation is currently being
worked on

140
00:08:19,770 --> 00:08:24,090
the project is called warnings and they
have said that there will be no wine

141
00:08:24,090 --> 00:08:25,090
before its time

142
00:08:25,090 --> 00:08:28,819
some thats that's not available yet
either it may be a few months apparently

143
00:08:28,819 --> 00:08:29,840
runs

144
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:30,539
a

145
00:08:30,539 --> 00:08:34,529
some limited MS DOS applications I'm
very much looking forward to that

146
00:08:34,529 --> 00:08:38,429
because the operating system cells tend
to be driven

147
00:08:38,430 --> 00:08:42,029
by applications and the words people
want to know does it run

148
00:08:42,029 --> 00:08:46,249
the Excel or does one word or this or
that they've applications and if it does

149
00:08:46,249 --> 00:08:48,100
they really don't care what the
underlying

150
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:51,920
operating system is but it offers the
more performance a greater advantages

151
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:54,128
they'll we will learn that they will
choose that

152
00:08:54,129 --> 00:08:57,850
some Lindsay questions

153
00:08:57,850 --> 00:09:04,040
that gentleman that begins okay you

154
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:09,740
the four this is done

155
00:09:09,740 --> 00:09:10,890
yeah

156
00:09:10,890 --> 00:09:11,580
home

157
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:16,880
lies resource means the problem is that
much the same myself but never been

158
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:18,660
asked that question unfortunately I

159
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:22,199
most the questions that I get asked
generally fall into the Obama doesn't

160
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:23,370
install on my system

161
00:09:23,370 --> 00:09:28,190
writing but we do gets not embarrassed
compiler questions and questions

162
00:09:28,190 --> 00:09:31,840
in other areas a you might want to try
sending

163
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:35,670
minus itself some email and get a
response in six months

164
00:09:35,670 --> 00:09:40,010
about yes these were the people that get
a few hundred messages a day

165
00:09:40,010 --> 00:09:42,080
soon

166
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:43,880
1

167
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:45,000
I

168
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,529
there's another long let alone

169
00:09:48,529 --> 00:09:53,209
yeah the way words well

170
00:09:53,209 --> 00:09:55,860
you know the

171
00:09:55,860 --> 00:10:01,560
miss return is that is that a new
development & Sons

172
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:04,920
where you can get mosaic a mosaic will
run into when it's

173
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:09,920
you just switched yeah

174
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:13,640
we just can't put it on CD rom and
distribute it that way that's why the

175
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:17,580
be it's not on there my know that

176
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:22,440
really made my more

177
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:23,420
yeah

178
00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:26,890
that's going to come along

179
00:10:26,890 --> 00:10:30,069
I just recently sold announcement the

180
00:10:30,070 --> 00:10:35,350
that a week ago for stasi drivers for
PCR the problem with that is that PCI

181
00:10:35,350 --> 00:10:39,830
um is still sort of leading-edge maybe
not to you when I but the people that

182
00:10:39,830 --> 00:10:42,790
the by the machines namely the
developers and developers don't know

183
00:10:42,790 --> 00:10:47,490
PCI machines the were making sure that
pat brokering gets one but he's

184
00:10:47,490 --> 00:10:51,880
he doesn't write the colonels I was we
tried support the other developers the

185
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:57,490
various aspects but since then we
support the moment to that ins

186
00:10:57,490 --> 00:10:58,050
really

187
00:10:58,050 --> 00:10:59,450
yen's

188
00:10:59,450 --> 00:11:04,690
young women's how many people here using
Linux server were tried in eggs and

189
00:11:04,690 --> 00:11:05,470
suppose

190
00:11:05,470 --> 00:11:08,360
your room

191
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:10,870
might be busy

192
00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:15,390
that many people are thinking and
joining will accept that

193
00:11:15,390 --> 00:11:21,110
this and I guess did stress that means

194
00:11:21,110 --> 00:11:23,490
said

195
00:11:23,490 --> 00:11:26,730
unions

196
00:11:26,730 --> 00:11:29,390
police

197
00:11:29,390 --> 00:11:30,069
time

198
00:11:30,070 --> 00:11:33,150
%um me

199
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:37,150
Lincoln there are at least

200
00:11:37,150 --> 00:11:41,730
45 different versions up Linux
distributions that you can download off

201
00:11:41,730 --> 00:11:42,640
the internet

202
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:46,120
the most popular is is still the
Slackware distribution

203
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:51,430
the seconds and these numbers were these
the slaughter I'm giving it was based on

204
00:11:51,430 --> 00:11:53,060
the numbers that were published

205
00:11:53,060 --> 00:11:57,200
the Linux journal few months ago may
have changed as suspects like was even

206
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:00,060
more popular these days because it's
gotten easier to install

207
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:04,220
but the with number Slackware SLs

208
00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:08,280
soft landing systems which is one of the
first be comprehensive

209
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:12,010
Linux distributions then there's and
said MCC

210
00:12:12,010 --> 00:12:15,080
from the Manchester computing center
which is more the strip them

211
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:19,080
version which people use to installs
base system and then

212
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:22,760
build their own Linux system from there
and then there's another version called

213
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:23,580
Debbie in

214
00:12:23,580 --> 00:12:29,020
which is being worked on right milan is
being touted as the next

215
00:12:29,020 --> 00:12:32,400
Slackware supposedly then I may have
missed

216
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:36,790
wanted to this there are enhancements
that like the GE enhancements to limits

217
00:12:36,790 --> 00:12:37,650
and so forth but

218
00:12:37,650 --> 00:12:41,199
when they're the commercial
distributions which there are several

219
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:46,090
the the edges so distribution the LG
Nexus division is one of them

220
00:12:46,090 --> 00:12:49,600
that's separate and distinct
distribution mmm

221
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:53,890
and I suspect that there is at least two
more one from nascent

222
00:12:53,890 --> 00:12:56,900
technologies %uh and the other one from
you

223
00:12:56,900 --> 00:12:59,830
I think from a company called Red Hat
although I haven't seen anything it's

224
00:12:59,830 --> 00:13:02,350
that still to be determined with that is

225
00:13:02,350 --> 00:13:05,830
yes things

226
00:13:05,830 --> 00:13:08,769
on

227
00:13:08,769 --> 00:13:12,510
the

228
00:13:12,510 --> 00:13:16,499
me

229
00:13:16,499 --> 00:13:17,170
time

230
00:13:17,170 --> 00:13:24,170
this

231
00:13:26,019 --> 00:13:27,760
you

232
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:32,010
um what do you mean by combining them as
the same bus system

233
00:13:32,010 --> 00:13:35,370
the he uses you

234
00:13:35,370 --> 00:13:38,600
limited well it's better not to

235
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:42,140
if you're going to switch between major
Linux distributions it's better just to

236
00:13:42,140 --> 00:13:43,610
back up the files

237
00:13:43,610 --> 00:13:46,440
that you need to say and then install
the next one it would just be too much

238
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:47,150
of a headache

239
00:13:47,150 --> 00:13:50,230
if you want to upgrade your distribution

240
00:13:50,230 --> 00:13:54,020
you can either go out and get the
packages you want upgraded piecemeal

241
00:13:54,020 --> 00:13:55,520
which is which is fine

242
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:58,870
or get the next version in the
distribution Slackware

243
00:13:58,870 --> 00:14:01,920
in recent versions as offered me a min 3

244
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:07,300
upgrade capabilities you can upgrade
individual packages in some forms

245
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:08,740
moles

246
00:14:08,740 --> 00:14:13,100
yeah

247
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:17,200
strange the the word on on that was

248
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:20,980
it was more hearsay than anything else I
don't know what the current state

249
00:14:20,980 --> 00:14:21,920
developments

250
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:26,050
they were going to in the project was
code-named cosic to same course there I

251
00:14:26,050 --> 00:14:26,500
think

252
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:31,280
that was written up in PC week but
nobody of course it nobel's saying

253
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:32,520
anything about it

254
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:35,590
it was going to be based on the Linux
kernel and and Bob

255
00:14:35,590 --> 00:14:39,400
you may have some additional information
on yet this jury on aidid

256
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:43,630
sexy a very interesting marketing issue
even more than in technology one would

257
00:14:43,630 --> 00:14:45,890
turn a new bill song was that

258
00:14:45,890 --> 00:14:49,380
links with the extremely efficient not
cruel

259
00:14:49,380 --> 00:14:53,980
where the PC me when to take advantage
that need on the clinic she first

260
00:14:53,980 --> 00:14:55,780
started talking to Linus Torvalds

261
00:14:55,780 --> 00:14:59,310
something like nine months ago noble

262
00:14:59,310 --> 00:15:03,430
their rate to do that with you that
would be okay India percent sure

263
00:15:03,430 --> 00:15:07,670
little point in the GPL I'm would happen
though

264
00:15:07,670 --> 00:15:11,700
was they develop this great product a
bun in some outside technology from

265
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:14,760
people like physics software they're
looking glass said

266
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:18,620
a friend into it and they had this
really nifty desktop

267
00:15:18,620 --> 00:15:23,040
UNIX basically but then the rain into
the heck up a bookie howdy is selling

268
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:27,230
hear their own selling UNIX you know
capital unex

269
00:15:27,230 --> 00:15:30,820
and in how did the then convince people
that

270
00:15:30,820 --> 00:15:35,600
UNIX is a you a worthwhile project to
put on your PC when they're also selling

271
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:36,820
this spree

272
00:15:36,820 --> 00:15:41,700
pride and effectively in the PC any with
their marketing department dick could

273
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:43,880
not get their arms around that

274
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:49,160
marketing my take on it from when he
first saw nets during my background is

275
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:52,660
there's one in a closet thing the
technical questions then and I'm here to

276
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:55,660
eat through the that the market is known
to the world from

277
00:15:55,660 --> 00:16:00,490
the is my take on it was always that

278
00:16:00,490 --> 00:16:04,720
this was a great idea but it didn't make
sense to be sold with the nobel

279
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:05,450
structure

280
00:16:05,450 --> 00:16:08,480
it was a product that mean perfect sense
to spin on

281
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:11,760
the from Nobel apparently empresa

282
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:16,260
yeah and I'm dome yeah I would say
they'll you know is brilliant for you

283
00:16:16,260 --> 00:16:19,470
this ok because is pretty obvious to a
lot of people but apparently renew

284
00:16:19,470 --> 00:16:19,940
murder

285
00:16:19,940 --> 00:16:24,680
who is it was the chief executive New
Balance recently retired is no talking

286
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:25,420
aboot

287
00:16:25,420 --> 00:16:31,510
marketing net product busy independent
businesses then affiliated with new film

288
00:16:31,510 --> 00:16:31,840
and

289
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:35,830
minutes where the direction to that
product is going whether it ever happens

290
00:16:35,830 --> 00:16:38,860
we don't know it's still one

291
00:16:38,860 --> 00:16:44,240
new way it was even did to it being a
UNIX for the PC for small users who

292
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:45,490
didn't want to PE

293
00:16:45,490 --> 00:16:49,200
is me AT&T slash new bill lately syncing

294
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:53,700
be used to get access to the source code
night it was deemed very much the ticket

295
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:55,690
many to be a look around this room

296
00:16:55,690 --> 00:16:59,090
at the monument to Z as important links
is

297
00:16:59,090 --> 00:17:03,770
directly proportional to the number of
people who lose either using UNIX

298
00:17:03,770 --> 00:17:07,869
commercially and need to run it at home
were earn it

299
00:17:07,870 --> 00:17:11,900
invades does Windows users who need with
two

300
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:15,250
with those of us who are in the computer
industry you clearly and in doing so

301
00:17:15,250 --> 00:17:19,099
taking one referred to as he real
operating systems

302
00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:22,160
lyndon and

303
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:26,050
in its very much with two nubile body
healing worded

304

into the scene you people let me tell
you lies because the only to you can

305
00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:31,230
build upon it didn't lose

306
00:17:31,230 --> 00:17:34,520
really keen to all those small
businesses and

307
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:37,710
mean programs who needed simply a little
late

00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:56,029
with moons I'm

313
00:17:56,029 --> 00:18:01,320
german-born

314
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:04,210
um I heard a call for

315
00:18:04,210 --> 00:18:07,799
volunteers about the for months ago

316
00:18:07,799 --> 00:18:11,240
on the Internet much people want to put
together report for the

317
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:15,380
for the power road architecture but that
apparently the major manufacturers are

318
00:18:15,380 --> 00:18:16,820
due needing hardware

319
00:18:16,820 --> 00:18:21,158
it to these primary developers than a
decade do needed to tour molds a big

320
00:18:21,159 --> 00:18:22,330
help the machine

321
00:18:22,330 --> 00:18:27,820
needed to board till next to the Alpha
platform and IBM have do needed power PC

322
00:18:27,820 --> 00:18:28,760
unit

323
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:33,669
when they went to Torvalds I'm not sure
with the major manufactures are seeing

324
00:18:33,669 --> 00:18:35,940
all this enthusiasm for men

325
00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:40,130
young people like the people in this
room into realizing that the that would

326
00:18:40,130 --> 00:18:42,899
be really want in on this bandwagon is
in the eye

327
00:18:42,899 --> 00:18:47,210
immune problems you be

328
00:18:47,210 --> 00:18:51,380
PCI the yeah

329
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:54,890
a new idea which agreement for new to me

330
00:18:54,890 --> 00:18:58,630
the original no noting the power PC

331
00:18:58,630 --> 00:19:01,840
the one that you doing in conjunction
with Jordan quickly with X

332
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:06,439
rooms

333
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:08,440
money

334
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:11,330
millions

335
00:19:11,330 --> 00:19:11,980
right

336
00:19:11,980 --> 00:19:13,660
on

337
00:19:13,660 --> 00:19:18,240
there or actually two major versions
affects out there now the first one is

338
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:19,650
excellent or five

339
00:19:19,650 --> 00:19:22,690
the which was supported by the x3

340
00:19:22,690 --> 00:19:27,390
a development seen thats in version 2.0
1.1 right now

341
00:19:27,390 --> 00:19:30,730
that's probably gonna remain where it is
that the

342
00:19:30,730 --> 00:19:34,170
begun developing X 1106 and in fact

343
00:19:34,170 --> 00:19:37,640
the beta version that's 11 hours X 1106

344
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:43,660
or x3 3.0 is is on the latest mix CDs is
like Wipro the implemented you consult

345
00:19:43,660 --> 00:19:44,270
fourth

346
00:19:44,270 --> 00:19:47,940
I haven't had the nerve to use it it's
still

347
00:19:47,940 --> 00:19:51,810
still fairly early him

348
00:19:51,810 --> 00:19:55,540
then well video cards its

349
00:19:55,540 --> 00:19:58,590
it militants works with the with a lot
of video cards

350
00:19:58,590 --> 00:20:03,540
I'll tell you want to stay away from
like the West yeah they want to stay the

351
00:20:03,540 --> 00:20:06,610
you but you could probably answer this
is Bobby it's a diamond card

352
00:20:06,610 --> 00:20:12,580
right millions that in which it said
that's based on it may very well work

353
00:20:12,580 --> 00:20:14,699
you may not have it configured properly
but

354
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:17,900
the want to stay away from is the
diamond diamond refuses to release the

355
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:20,110
specifications for that card

356
00:20:20,110 --> 00:20:23,340
when the chips that without
non-disclosure agreement which means you

357
00:20:23,340 --> 00:20:23,899
can

358
00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:28,840
distribute the source to the drivers so
it's a catch-22

359
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:32,230
yes

360
00:20:32,230 --> 00:20:36,910
the x-men owns bubble but then it with
with with the networking capabilities

361
00:20:36,910 --> 00:20:38,100
and lick some unique and

362
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:42,049
act as both I'm you got its clients
built in there which can connect

363
00:20:42,049 --> 00:20:45,049
over the net or through the network to
an X server or

364
00:20:45,049 --> 00:20:48,610
local X server or unique at the server
you can have the clients anywhere and I

365
00:20:48,610 --> 00:20:49,179
mean it's

366
00:20:49,179 --> 00:20:52,840
it's like an ordinary units as the mean
you can run for example

367
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:56,649
when I work the wall street is a system
administrator were the first to say that

368
00:20:56,650 --> 00:20:57,440
the limits

369
00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:01,059
was to take a copy of rainmaker which
runs on Sun

370
00:21:01,059 --> 00:21:06,110
and run it own the server and then
explain it back to the Linux workstation

371
00:21:06,110 --> 00:21:06,630
which should

372
00:21:06,630 --> 00:21:11,250
which is the beautifully so they were in
FrameMaker on my Linux box

373
00:21:11,250 --> 00:21:16,000
me son

374
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:23,000
on

375
00:21:23,559 --> 00:21:27,190
on

376
00:21:27,190 --> 00:21:30,730
well is that the implementing here to
see it to read

377
00:21:30,730 --> 00:21:34,620
didn't see the new guidance very current
it has like for you

378
00:21:34,620 --> 00:21:38,790
we don't want it yet been do you name it
would be wrong for me to answer the

379
00:21:38,790 --> 00:21:41,700
questions and sign in with this year
interest in my own company

380
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:46,480
they're all good I'm you can install
Linux me every single one of them

381
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:51,490
the obviously impartial to mind but any
one of them will get you Linux install

382
00:21:51,490 --> 00:21:52,610
this is just a matter of

383
00:21:52,610 --> 00:21:56,780
what's provided with in terms of
documentation how easy is it to install

384
00:21:56,780 --> 00:22:00,920
and what you get for after the
installation support me cancer you were

385
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:01,890
here in the rain

386
00:22:01,890 --> 00:22:03,320
yet

387
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:06,770
the but among the more time

388
00:22:06,770 --> 00:22:08,220
I'm

389
00:22:08,220 --> 00:22:10,590
the I'm

390
00:22:10,590 --> 00:22:16,370
are martini more time

391
00:22:16,370 --> 00:22:17,450
more

392
00:22:17,450 --> 00:22:19,720
then

393
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:21,960
the new

394
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:24,440
night yeah

395
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:28,269
loan while Apple has its own XD grind
with the wax

396
00:22:28,269 --> 00:22:32,190
yeah that may be why no yet

397
00:22:32,190 --> 00:22:35,250
yeah the

398
00:22:35,250 --> 00:22:36,370
on

399
00:22:36,370 --> 00:22:37,340
to me

400
00:22:37,340 --> 00:22:40,699
%uh India my you I'm

401
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:41,730
will be

402
00:22:41,730 --> 00:22:43,260
horny

403
00:22:43,260 --> 00:22:44,900
room

404
00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:46,990
yeah I'm

405
00:22:46,990 --> 00:22:48,330
modeling

406
00:22:48,330 --> 00:22:50,040
work the

407
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:51,750
me

408
00:22:51,750 --> 00:22:52,620
you

409
00:22:52,620 --> 00:22:55,370
means

410
00:22:55,370 --> 00:22:57,910
listeners the lawn room

411
00:22:57,910 --> 00:23:00,269
yes babe I'm

412
00:23:00,269 --> 00:23:02,269
actions in the morning

413
00:23:02,269 --> 00:23:05,299
that's dependent upon the chipset

414
00:23:05,299 --> 00:23:09,709
that you've got and whether or not it
supported in the in the high res modes

415
00:23:09,709 --> 00:23:10,339
that that

416
00:23:10,339 --> 00:23:14,539
card offers for example you generally
you you don't need more than the mag I

417
00:23:14,539 --> 00:23:17,509
think if you're going to run into phone
256 colors

418
00:23:17,509 --> 00:23:22,919
in 1024 by 768 met maybe also if you're
gonna go beyond that

419
00:23:22,919 --> 00:23:29,459
Bay the card has to support that

420
00:23:29,459 --> 00:23:33,019
resolution that would use that much
memory were high collar one or the other

421
00:23:33,019 --> 00:23:34,369
I don't I'm not sure

422
00:23:34,369 --> 00:23:38,459
if the XP server goes beyond 256 colors
that's

423
00:23:38,459 --> 00:23:42,249
maybe somebody here can see you other
than that you might let you know there

424
00:23:42,249 --> 00:23:44,329
was an issue using super high-resolution

425
00:23:44,329 --> 00:23:51,329
you might need all that memory Jan this
gentleman at home

426
00:23:52,340 --> 00:23:54,050
the

427
00:23:54,050 --> 00:23:57,260
their rooms

428
00:23:57,260 --> 00:24:00,330
yeah know much is written them because
%uh the

429
00:24:00,330 --> 00:24:03,970
because the people who discover these
things are too busy to worry about

430
00:24:03,970 --> 00:24:04,830
writing it down

431
00:24:04,830 --> 00:24:08,360
we generally documents that when we have
customers called wouldn't make it an

432
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:10,730
attempt to install things and they don't
work

433
00:24:10,730 --> 00:24:15,920
%uh as to what doesn't work you're less
likely a finalist with doesn't work then

434
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:17,020
what does work

435
00:24:17,020 --> 00:24:22,950
on in terms that PC architecture it
works at most garden variety stuff

436
00:24:22,950 --> 00:24:26,250
%uh generally the cheaper it is

437
00:24:26,250 --> 00:24:30,090
the more likely it is going to work
simply because the developers are more

438
00:24:30,090 --> 00:24:32,070
likely to have access to that equipment

439
00:24:32,070 --> 00:24:35,070
first that makes sense that's

440
00:24:35,070 --> 00:24:41,169
the

441
00:24:41,170 --> 00:24:43,990
millions

442
00:24:43,990 --> 00:24:47,150
room well the chips are

443
00:24:47,150 --> 00:24:51,600
or at the issue really I have heard some
timing issues but primarily the problem

444
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:52,370
is that those

445
00:24:52,370 --> 00:24:55,590
so that's what some chips tend to be
running PCI bus machines

446
00:24:55,590 --> 00:25:00,389
and Linux again the is developed by
people who don't have access

447
00:25:00,390 --> 00:25:03,430
to the PCI systems %uh

448
00:25:03,430 --> 00:25:07,280
as a result there are problems with PCI
cards notably

449
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:11,710
I've spoken to a few customers this week
who had gateway PC I machines

450
00:25:11,710 --> 00:25:16,860
their ID controllers were reacting flaky
they actually had to slow them down to

451
00:25:16,860 --> 00:25:22,350
that ISA emulation modes with defeats
the purpose a PC I think PCI is

452
00:25:22,350 --> 00:25:26,150
is gonna be supported no I was i thinkin
as I know it will be supported it does

453
00:25:26,150 --> 00:25:26,800
work

454
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:31,680
through limits that buts don't expect to
use anything in the way upstairs the

455
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:37,060
who other just exotic cards at this time
give it give it a little bit slimmer

456
00:25:37,060 --> 00:25:44,060
this gentleman all the way in the back
done

457
00:25:45,350 --> 00:25:48,340
I'm sorry that means you let you go back
to me about alexis

458
00:25:48,340 --> 00:25:52,270
you the Bob I think answer this question

459
00:25:52,270 --> 00:25:55,860
yeah I did actually can I get a
shorthand how many people here

460
00:25:55,860 --> 00:25:59,630
guy a announcement from ECC

461
00:25:59,630 --> 00:26:04,750
a boat this meeting is his party the
user group announcement 0

462
00:26:04,750 --> 00:26:08,200
no will lead you to write okay be here's
why

463
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:12,440
the user group consists of been in New
York in until someone comes up with a

464
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:13,520
better when he became

465
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:16,730
peeps realism when we did is what we're
trying to do

466
00:26:16,730 --> 00:26:20,460
is a certain along the lines of clinics
in any case in

467
00:26:20,460 --> 00:26:25,710
is train take into as many other user
group activities as we can in other

468
00:26:25,710 --> 00:26:29,370
events so for example the hackers
conference was having a big conferences

469
00:26:29,370 --> 00:26:30,490
all organized

470
00:26:30,490 --> 00:26:34,250
and we just helps point to drag make a
long do that

471
00:26:34,250 --> 00:26:39,430
to answer questions so in that sense
this is a Linux New York City Linux user

472
00:26:39,430 --> 00:26:39,950
group

473
00:26:39,950 --> 00:26:46,250
sponsored event there will also be a
deal in eggs the user group but to

474
00:26:46,250 --> 00:26:46,930
defend

475
00:26:46,930 --> 00:26:52,020
UNIX Expo in the evening 0 and I believe
it's the Tuesday evening it'll be

476
00:26:52,020 --> 00:26:53,490
october third or fourth

477
00:26:53,490 --> 00:26:56,910
and in again well we'll add this is the
L

478
00:26:56,910 --> 00:27:00,560
New York City Linux user group will take
full credit for it did

479
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:04,350
the fact that Bruno blendon put on an
expo in

480
00:27:04,350 --> 00:27:07,400
do needed a room in and all the rest
david Turner is

481
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:11,370
sir domestically many German so on top
in that the announcement today sent

482
00:27:11,370 --> 00:27:13,150
around also included at

483
00:27:13,150 --> 00:27:16,660
a comment to the effect you know we'd
like to have the Sept

484
00:27:16,660 --> 00:27:20,030
user group meeting but I don't have the
time to organize when

485
00:27:20,030 --> 00:27:24,010
her go if anyone in this room Wednesday
organized in September meeting

486
00:27:24,010 --> 00:27:27,700
and the key thing to meetings even more
than finding an

487
00:27:27,700 --> 00:27:32,630
and and nationally known now mullenix
people this be the key to any meeting

488
00:27:32,630 --> 00:27:34,420
between New York City area

489
00:27:34,420 --> 00:27:37,690
is to find a room and its excesses

490
00:27:37,690 --> 00:27:42,240
as a room that the lettuce into the
exact here during the third is so the

491
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:46,330
issue is if you know where there's a
room and and you're prepared to help

492
00:27:46,330 --> 00:27:47,669
organize when nature

493
00:27:47,670 --> 00:27:51,250
let me know in del certainly provides
them with the publicity for it would be

494
00:27:51,250 --> 00:27:52,380
great

495
00:27:52,380 --> 00:27:56,220
okay the selling my bacterium

496
00:27:56,220 --> 00:28:01,470
pretty basic actually most machines
these days are quick to run in 386 and

497
00:28:01,470 --> 00:28:02,490
486

498
00:28:02,490 --> 00:28:06,940
%uh gently I would say format covering
them although you can run a little less

499
00:28:06,940 --> 00:28:10,090
you not gonna be able to do much for me
will make the

500
00:28:10,090 --> 00:28:13,950
for a minimal installation it make if
you can run X Windows

501
00:28:13,950 --> 00:28:17,560
were more you know the more the merrier
%uh terms distaste

502
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:20,960
that's heavily dependent upon which
distribution you have

503
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:24,380
know much about you you want to install
and whether or not you gonna run parts a

504
00:28:24,380 --> 00:28:25,580
bit from the cd-rom

505
00:28:25,580 --> 00:28:29,790
up for example with Slackware pro you
can get away with as little as

506
00:28:29,790 --> 00:28:34,720
eight megabytes Obelix partition were 11
megabytes of an uncompressed

507
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:38,530
DOS partition and run the ball to that
of the CD-rom

508
00:28:38,530 --> 00:28:42,000
mmm so but I can go as high as

509
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:45,840
two or three hundred megabytes you know
for all the binaries the

510
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:49,780
the library is the funds and so forth so
it varies I think the average

511
00:28:49,780 --> 00:28:51,010
distribution from

512
00:28:51,010 --> 00:28:58,010
the folks that we deal with tends to be
about BT to emerge in 20 magnums

513
00:28:58,670 --> 00:29:01,090
yeah

514
00:29:01,090 --> 00:29:05,200
the 2.0 well everything was upgraded

515
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:10,610
basically Pat sat on that floor we
didn't sit on it we were working with

516
00:29:10,610 --> 00:29:11,270
him in it

517
00:29:11,270 --> 00:29:15,020
took a while to get all the bugs Luna
the between

518
00:29:15,020 --> 00:29:18,220
various applications but essentially

519
00:29:18,220 --> 00:29:21,620
the compiler was upgraded colonels
upgraded

520
00:29:21,620 --> 00:29:25,850
X Windows is upgraded all the major
system applications the

521
00:29:25,850 --> 00:29:30,280
detect program the those groups
interpreter was upgraded

522
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:33,530
mmm the libraries to see libraries

523
00:29:33,530 --> 00:29:37,780
even the ex libris a believer upgraded
so everything is new in the installation

524
00:29:37,780 --> 00:29:40,270
program has been spiffed up at New

525
00:29:40,270 --> 00:29:43,490
always you options for configuring you
know your monitor

526
00:29:43,490 --> 00:29:48,310
when you when you when you're installing
it's got a little easier to install and

527
00:29:48,310 --> 00:29:51,570
everything's been updated so it's on par
with everything else is out there right

528
00:29:51,570 --> 00:29:53,060
now it's it's not cold anymore

529
00:29:53,060 --> 00:29:57,490
just take somebody else yo

530
00:29:57,490 --> 00:29:59,370
loan

531
00:29:59,370 --> 00:30:03,820
well one is being worked on like
everything else with an ex most evidence

532
00:30:03,820 --> 00:30:05,620
is pretty much moans your work

533
00:30:05,620 --> 00:30:09,980
um it does run someone those
applications but as the right now it's

534
00:30:09,980 --> 00:30:10,620
really

535
00:30:10,620 --> 00:30:14,640
it's not ready for prime time it's it's
certainly not up to the level that the

536
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:15,690
DOS emulator

537
00:30:15,690 --> 00:30:19,780
is right now i mean i buy your plays a
pretty good game solitaire

538
00:30:19,780 --> 00:30:23,010
means but that that's

539
00:30:23,010 --> 00:30:27,299
but you don't expect too much from its
out there you can you can run basically

540
00:30:27,299 --> 00:30:30,629
alpha versions other or even pre-alpha
versions other but should not

541
00:30:30,630 --> 00:30:34,380
the I wouldn't trust it then I would use
it for anything that you

542
00:30:34,380 --> 00:30:37,450
that you planned on not having to
recover the ball with files with

543
00:30:37,450 --> 00:30:38,260
afterwards

544
00:30:38,260 --> 00:30:41,690
mom well

545
00:30:41,690 --> 00:30:46,250
wine is essentially the Linux version of
wabi and

546
00:30:46,250 --> 00:30:49,580
so that's I mean that's the answer to
its being worked on

547
00:30:49,580 --> 00:30:53,210
you can push it it's it's it's not many
like is that there will be no wine

548
00:30:53,210 --> 00:30:54,830
before its time and that's true

549
00:30:54,830 --> 00:31:00,570
its you when it's ready its ratings

550
00:31:00,570 --> 00:31:03,649
and on

551
00:31:03,650 --> 00:31:05,290
on

552
00:31:05,290 --> 00:31:06,260
so many

553
00:31:06,260 --> 00:31:07,730
you know love

554
00:31:07,730 --> 00:31:10,970
known

555
00:31:10,970 --> 00:31:13,450
libraries

556
00:31:13,450 --> 00:31:14,010
home

557
00:31:14,010 --> 00:31:17,410
my them to the developing motif
applications

558
00:31:17,410 --> 00:31:22,160
world yet known

559
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:22,650
the

560
00:31:22,650 --> 00:31:25,670
years on

561
00:31:25,670 --> 00:31:29,600
mean pay it's possible I haven't heard
about it but then again

562
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:34,310
um why would be surprised if I had it I
had known about it were available it

563
00:31:34,310 --> 00:31:36,220
would be in very wide use right now

564
00:31:36,220 --> 00:31:40,410
%uh on in fact bob is this is the
distributor I love

565
00:31:40,410 --> 00:31:44,790
multi the exclusive distributor of the
Sequoias motif product in the US

566
00:31:44,790 --> 00:31:48,540
%uh and I think he might have heard
about that too you did

567
00:31:48,540 --> 00:31:52,830
there's actually a whole bunch really
good window managers that run on winning

568
00:31:52,830 --> 00:31:54,139
sign X Windows

569
00:31:54,140 --> 00:31:57,520
means knowing a developmental yeah
exactly so the the

570
00:31:57,520 --> 00:32:01,320
catches agrees that they are not motif

571
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:06,480
compatible in in particular we we sell
led motif to

572
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:10,570
and it suited I guess maybe first point
is you don't really need motif

573
00:32:10,570 --> 00:32:13,629
unless you're planning on writing
applications that you're going to run

574
00:32:13,630 --> 00:32:14,140
run

575
00:32:14,140 --> 00:32:17,510
on muti systems the in the real

576
00:32:17,510 --> 00:32:20,610
UNIX world if you like and send an HP
versions

577
00:32:20,610 --> 00:32:24,700
and if you're going to do that then you
have to have the motif window manager

578
00:32:24,700 --> 00:32:26,720
it's really as simple as that

579
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:29,960
I'm not aware I don't move crude so you
know we're

580
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:33,750
many of these products that do much
better than that but dead certainly who

581
00:32:33,750 --> 00:32:34,870
were selling

582
00:32:34,870 --> 00:32:38,190
all OVR muti versions too were people
who were taking

583
00:32:38,190 --> 00:32:41,320
motif applications of a person machine

584
00:32:41,320 --> 00:32:44,710
working on them on their Linux box in
order to put them back on its own

585
00:32:44,710 --> 00:32:47,960
machine using Negreanu C&C plus plus
compilers

586
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:51,450
that's very straight forward in a very
reliable thing to you

587
00:32:51,450 --> 00:32:54,920
there is at least one effort that I know
about them

588
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:58,070
on going to develop a free motif clone

589
00:32:58,070 --> 00:33:03,580
my think that's being sponsored by the
folks over they do sell

590
00:33:03,580 --> 00:33:07,490
a I don't know that acted I don't know
anything about other than that they said

591
00:33:07,490 --> 00:33:08,400
they were doing in

592
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:12,280
mmm and I have heard other people the

593
00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:16,500
make mumblings about wanting to want to
do it know whether or not it's

594
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:19,580
it's it's happening I can say um

595
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:22,940
bull I just will say that understand
what all this well all this fuss is

596
00:33:22,940 --> 00:33:26,440
about motif open look works just fine
and so than any the other window

597
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:27,360
managers like

598
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:34,360
yeah

599
00:33:34,670 --> 00:33:39,050
you're right its applications rather
than your writing

600
00:33:39,050 --> 00:33:43,139
you that meant that maybe sometime I'd
like everything else in a lil its role

601
00:33:43,140 --> 00:33:45,410
that you don't believe it's going to
happen it probably will

602
00:33:45,410 --> 00:33:52,410
yummy

603
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:57,320
them not right now not for limits

604
00:33:57,320 --> 00:34:00,980
a the reason for that i think is the
most the people who abuse links up to

605
00:34:00,980 --> 00:34:01,830
this point

606
00:34:01,830 --> 00:34:05,000
or either very technical or mostly
technical

607
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:08,469
%uh and consequently I think they would
you that is an affront

608
00:34:08,470 --> 00:34:11,520
on the on the a but

609
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:14,969
that having said that I'm seeing more
and more people

610
00:34:14,970 --> 00:34:20,480
I'll less-than-stellar hacking abilities
using Linux and we were talking about

611
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:24,260
more the more average people who were
either UNIX curious

612
00:34:24,260 --> 00:34:28,090
were internet curious and slicks gives
them both both

613
00:34:28,090 --> 00:34:32,179
those things they can connect to the in
a very readily then they can learn

614
00:34:32,179 --> 00:34:36,179
units they're really it's very cheap
were all free if they have a high-speed

615
00:34:36,179 --> 00:34:36,700
modem

616
00:34:36,700 --> 00:34:40,210
I'll so I suspect

617
00:34:40,210 --> 00:34:44,550
that the its just around the corner
that's

618
00:34:44,550 --> 00:34:46,899
the

619
00:34:46,899 --> 00:34:52,049
the mall the loan

620
00:34:52,050 --> 00:34:52,800
times

621
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:59,150
the clintons Kirk you have been answered
with my memories are male women's

622
00:34:59,150 --> 00:35:01,150
you

623
00:35:01,150 --> 00:35:01,750
on

624
00:35:01,750 --> 00:35:04,640
the mall

625
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:05,870
means

626
00:35:05,870 --> 00:35:10,790
yet to the in general election is the
point we didn't make earlier and

627
00:35:10,790 --> 00:35:14,250
the given this is in in theory a user
group meeting

628
00:35:14,250 --> 00:35:17,390
and if anyone has a better answer

629
00:35:17,390 --> 00:35:21,150
for any other questions that come on
please stick up your hand in in wave it

630
00:35:21,150 --> 00:35:22,700
around like crazy in India

631
00:35:22,700 --> 00:35:25,720
would be very interested in hearing from
you yet

632
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:29,850
me the catch with any technology is
complex and something like clinics

633
00:35:29,850 --> 00:35:35,170
is the at best you gonna be expert in
only one corner of the technology in

634
00:35:35,170 --> 00:35:38,590
members spent more time in the other
corners is obviously going to have

635
00:35:38,590 --> 00:35:44,260
better in terms

636
00:35:44,260 --> 00:35:47,770
statement me

637
00:35:47,770 --> 00:35:53,440
on room

638
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:54,640
you

639
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:58,529
well it's already in the and and at
least in Slackware is it's available

640
00:35:58,529 --> 00:36:00,799
that's really available on the Internet

641
00:36:00,799 --> 00:36:05,089
home well the only at all the
development tools are in

642
00:36:05,089 --> 00:36:09,430
oh yeah absolutely the shooting at the
complete version a lot of times people

643
00:36:09,430 --> 00:36:11,169
just get the runtime version

644
00:36:11,170 --> 00:36:14,329
%uh because the night you interested in
doing interviews I mean there's so many

645
00:36:14,329 --> 00:36:16,749
different library which it that's out
there that

646
00:36:16,749 --> 00:36:20,299
you could you go crazy I don't
personally the audience programming my

647
00:36:20,299 --> 00:36:22,029
in your portfolio years ago

648
00:36:22,029 --> 00:36:25,400
the with the broom a

649
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:29,509
so i i think was going and growing
businesses that uses missions

650
00:36:29,509 --> 00:36:32,869
this system administration in system
integration

651
00:36:32,869 --> 00:36:37,059
just moved to Lawrence open museum

652
00:36:37,059 --> 00:36:37,530
here

653
00:36:37,530 --> 00:36:38,370
the

654
00:36:38,370 --> 00:36:42,960
there is a cure-all and

655
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:48,170
them well let's begin with this is so
widely used the balls

656
00:36:48,170 --> 00:36:52,550
security flaws in the incident down the
fairly quickly there was one very well

657
00:36:52,550 --> 00:36:56,380
advertised in a few months ago which
would get you relax its almost done

658
00:36:56,380 --> 00:37:00,840
was the limits machine prior to a
certain version that subsequently been

659
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:01,700
sexed

660
00:37:01,700 --> 00:37:05,860
um any UNIX system is only as secure as
the administrator wants to make it an

661
00:37:05,860 --> 00:37:07,160
issue only loopholes

662
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:10,770
in their there and they're the for
example the default %uh

663
00:37:10,770 --> 00:37:14,430
distributions most of them offer you the
option of installing

664
00:37:14,430 --> 00:37:19,080
basically no a cancer can sleep guest
with no passwords

665
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:22,880
that those could be counted as the
security hole because most people simply

666
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:23,830
just say yes

667
00:37:23,830 --> 00:37:28,110
install them um you know I'm sure
there's lotsa stuff in there

668
00:37:28,110 --> 00:37:31,680
and then lets that waiting to be
discovered but the

669
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:35,839
I don't know its its I would say it's
probably no less secure than any other

670
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:36,500
version

671
00:37:36,500 --> 00:37:41,170
and which isn't saying much James

672
00:37:41,170 --> 00:37:44,650
your your the

673
00:37:44,650 --> 00:37:48,030
all the lines

674
00:37:48,030 --> 00:37:49,780
mind

675
00:37:49,780 --> 00:37:52,900
yeah we view it is an interesting
anecdotes

676
00:37:52,900 --> 00:37:56,910
I gots then I think this is the first
time I've

677
00:37:56,910 --> 00:38:00,310
enzymes mentions publicly the percent

678
00:38:00,310 --> 00:38:04,350
came after us about the move for five
months ago

679
00:38:04,350 --> 00:38:08,960
we got a very threatening letter from
their attorney the indicating that we

680
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:09,750
were knots

681
00:38:09,750 --> 00:38:14,140
properly distributing the software in
other words for those in this room than

682
00:38:14,140 --> 00:38:17,799
originally with a new Public License it
basically requires you to either

683
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:21,270
distribute the binary with the
accompanying source

684
00:38:21,270 --> 00:38:26,630
war include a written that notice that
she will supply the supports the source

685
00:38:26,630 --> 00:38:27,970
code on the means

686
00:38:27,970 --> 00:38:32,920
I'll we subsequently contacted them and
explain to them that was an intentional

687
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:34,210
mission we were simply

688
00:38:34,210 --> 00:38:38,040
mirroring the archives sites New York
I'd sites were doing a very good job

689
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:41,320
love the matching the source code

690
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:45,430
to the existing by now is that there was
storing %uh subsequent to that we came

691
00:38:45,430 --> 00:38:46,620
out with a Slackware

692
00:38:46,620 --> 00:38:50,100
prohibition in the the new Slackware has

693
00:38:50,100 --> 00:38:53,509
all complete one to one correspondence
binary to source

694
00:38:53,510 --> 00:38:57,010
the only exception on that was the X
Window System which by itself

695
00:38:57,010 --> 00:39:00,580
I think the source is well over 100
megabytes we didn't have the room for

696
00:39:00,580 --> 00:39:01,009
that

697
00:39:01,010 --> 00:39:04,250
and the source license for that doesn't
require it to be

698
00:39:04,250 --> 00:39:07,990
redistributed no I don't think many
people in this room will be under

699
00:39:07,990 --> 00:39:13,340
really into hacking the X server that's
for the extra development seems

700
00:39:13,340 --> 00:39:16,530
there any other questions room and my

701
00:39:16,530 --> 00:39:17,700
this

702
00:39:17,700 --> 00:39:21,120
names on

703
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:23,779
me on

704
00:39:23,780 --> 00:39:26,980
ok and will sockets course during
because in

705
00:39:26,980 --> 00:39:30,930
Linux is the what's my mind at least
looks

706
00:39:30,930 --> 00:39:33,470
from it from an administrative
standpoint looks an awful lot like

707
00:39:33,470 --> 00:39:34,350
getting

708
00:39:34,350 --> 00:39:37,470
like BST moms

709
00:39:37,470 --> 00:39:40,790
season streams I don't think streams are
in there

710
00:39:40,790 --> 00:39:44,650
then I doubt they'll be implemented any
time soon AT&T doesn't have the best

711
00:39:44,650 --> 00:39:45,180
name

712
00:39:45,180 --> 00:39:50,069
in with the with units anchors that as a
result in some other things they did the

713
00:39:50,070 --> 00:39:51,020
system but

714
00:39:51,020 --> 00:39:55,330
however there are a lot of system 5
enhancements to Linux

715
00:39:55,330 --> 00:39:59,049
I mean the things that were in to
offensive

716
00:39:59,050 --> 00:40:03,380
the system 5 than their way insulin X
for example the

717
00:40:03,380 --> 00:40:07,859
this system above or see initialization
bosnians to be with her

718
00:40:07,859 --> 00:40:11,200
that even with up till recently with I
think it's unless

719
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:15,630
it was just made maybe one major RC
filing in the Etsy directory

720
00:40:15,630 --> 00:40:19,030
which called a few others now this is an
entire supplementary

721
00:40:19,030 --> 00:40:22,380
the RC that the subdirectory this that
system 5

722
00:40:22,380 --> 00:40:26,070
RC then you have the the term lifestyles

723
00:40:26,070 --> 00:40:30,609
you have the system by style in its %uh
in various other aspects of the

724
00:40:30,609 --> 00:40:33,759
which I forget but yeah it's it's more a
hybrid

725
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:37,859
love system by then be as the personally
I think from administrative standpoint

726
00:40:37,859 --> 00:40:40,890
it's more BST but I think from a
programmer standpoint

727
00:40:40,890 --> 00:40:44,589
oftentimes his hits a lot like system 50
posits which

728
00:40:44,590 --> 00:40:47,910
tend to start a merchant into one
another its

729
00:40:47,910 --> 00:40:52,710
touted as being the posits complain
operating system they make no

730
00:40:52,710 --> 00:40:55,780
and allowances to be the BST

731
00:40:55,780 --> 00:40:59,560
or system 5 in when they say you know
with compatible with but

732
00:40:59,560 --> 00:41:03,529
if you use it and if you use BST or
system but you'll see

733
00:41:03,530 --> 00:41:07,320
the differences or the features that
have been taken from both so it's very

734
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:08,290
much a hybrid

735
00:41:08,290 --> 00:41:11,430
Graham a

736
00:41:11,430 --> 00:41:15,109
RAM this

737
00:41:15,109 --> 00:41:18,229
no there there are no limitations

738
00:41:18,229 --> 00:41:21,440
input artificial limitations like with
Dawson posts

739
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:25,680
with the six forty K the only time
you'll see anything like that

740
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:29,519
this has been recently as i think is
recently added to the kernel

741
00:41:29,519 --> 00:41:33,660
a good time at least with slack blisters
and Slackware inspect its a colonel

742
00:41:33,660 --> 00:41:34,788
think it's not the

743
00:41:34,789 --> 00:41:39,069
Slackware think on before the kernel
switches into

744
00:41:39,069 --> 00:41:42,279
protected mode it's only limited so I
think

745
00:41:42,279 --> 00:41:46,190
them when they go by the address space
and the kernel you're using is fairly

746
00:41:46,190 --> 00:41:48,109
bloated with excess drivers

747
00:41:48,109 --> 00:41:51,288
and other devices you'll get a message
that says

748
00:41:51,289 --> 00:41:55,950
at boot sandwiches memory is tight
that's caused a lot of people

749
00:41:55,950 --> 00:41:59,640
to worry that maybe they were running
into resources when in fact the message

750
00:41:59,640 --> 00:42:00,848
is superfluous

751
00:42:00,849 --> 00:42:04,950
because everyone gets it the first time
the boot the system this is always more

752
00:42:04,950 --> 00:42:09,709
device drivers in the booth colonel
because the need to be able to recognize

753
00:42:09,709 --> 00:42:13,319
as many devices possible to get Linux
installs on

754
00:42:13,319 --> 00:42:16,349
my mine names

755
00:42:16,349 --> 00:42:19,589
time I a normal

756
00:42:19,589 --> 00:42:24,058
yeah I I don't see if your machine
supports it

757
00:42:24,059 --> 00:42:27,380
yeah the hard drives the only issue with
hard drives

758
00:42:27,380 --> 00:42:30,769
currently well they're actually there
are two issues with our joins the first

759
00:42:30,769 --> 00:42:32,559
is a BIOS limitation

760
00:42:32,559 --> 00:42:36,099
on a boot limitation it for example

761
00:42:36,099 --> 00:42:40,670
you have the bootable portion on Linux
installed

762
00:42:40,670 --> 00:42:46,579
beyond 2024 cylinders on your on your
hard drive you will be able to do it

763
00:42:46,579 --> 00:42:50,259
you have to the licks once it boots
takes over

764
00:42:50,259 --> 00:42:53,489
ans it setup right will properly

765
00:42:53,489 --> 00:42:56,979
recognize or interpret the hardware as
it is in other words it doesn't

766
00:42:56,979 --> 00:43:01,180
pretty much rely on the BIOS that all it
stays away from that it doesn't make any

767
00:43:01,180 --> 00:43:03,989
assumptions about the hardware goes out
in Jax

768
00:43:03,989 --> 00:43:07,219
a oftentimes I see people will call me
up

769
00:43:07,219 --> 00:43:11,079
with the problem with the system and the
first thing I'll say is

770
00:43:11,079 --> 00:43:15,519
I tried this and it doesn't work under
DOS well i've seen

771
00:43:15,519 --> 00:43:18,640
dos work with machines that had severely

772
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:22,299
severely brain dead random the
manageable

773
00:43:22,299 --> 00:43:25,910
well any version again it's not just the
surly links been any version of Unix its

774
00:43:25,910 --> 00:43:28,519
love exercises that ram a little bit
better

775
00:43:28,519 --> 00:43:31,529
and they suddenly discovered
efficiencies that this system

776
00:43:31,529 --> 00:43:35,449
the so compatibility with the last is

777
00:43:35,449 --> 00:43:39,650
really not a litmus test the weather
it's going to work with Linux but next

778
00:43:39,650 --> 00:43:43,119
you know those some does support I would
say on

779
00:43:43,119 --> 00:43:46,079
whole more things than the last those
without having to go out and get

780
00:43:46,079 --> 00:43:47,430
external device drivers

781
00:43:47,430 --> 00:43:52,769
yes well don't think there's any
physical limitations I mean if you've

782
00:43:52,769 --> 00:43:54,859
got for example you can have to study

783
00:43:54,859 --> 00:43:59,029
controllers in your new system you can
have as many as seven devices on each

784
00:43:59,029 --> 00:44:02,819
lemme Prodrive

785
00:44:02,819 --> 00:44:06,529
that I can answer I don't think people

786
00:44:06,529 --> 00:44:11,949
mines the and I don't think that's a
limitation is anyone else know

787
00:44:11,949 --> 00:44:18,650
your money

788
00:44:18,650 --> 00:44:21,660
Burnley down policemen

789
00:44:21,660 --> 00:44:26,009
new me that's probably not a good idea
to have partitions that large anyone

790
00:44:26,009 --> 00:44:32,240
the process that good he said than usual

791
00:44:32,240 --> 00:44:34,660
then

792
00:44:34,660 --> 00:44:38,920
%uh you know yet

793
00:44:38,920 --> 00:44:42,880
not yet this is the answer just let the
they had enough they have

794
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:45,970
the switch we can be become make them

795
00:44:45,970 --> 00:44:50,660
on extended I D James your all

796
00:44:50,660 --> 00:44:55,160
he always enough but wall yea

797
00:44:55,160 --> 00:44:56,930
money

798
00:44:56,930 --> 00:44:58,149
I'm

799
00:44:58,150 --> 00:44:59,920
busy

800
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:04,970
them things

801
00:45:04,970 --> 00:45:09,530
do you have any other questions

802
00:45:09,530 --> 00:45:12,770
the

803
00:45:12,770 --> 00:45:13,770
0

804
00:45:13,770 --> 00:45:15,830
awesome

805
00:45:15,830 --> 00:45:17,759
this

806
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:21,950
I'm

807
00:45:21,950 --> 00:45:23,720
means

808
00:45:23,720 --> 00:45:26,980
well the the core the operating system

809
00:45:26,980 --> 00:45:30,780
the kernel he needs his name was written
by Linus Torvalds

810
00:45:30,780 --> 00:45:34,750
bin Laden's they'll the device drivers

811
00:45:34,750 --> 00:45:37,940
or maintained by whomever chooses to

812
00:45:37,940 --> 00:45:41,490
whoever's brave enough to write a device
driver for a particular device

813
00:45:41,490 --> 00:45:44,710
ones that supporting adnan usually
within the known to someone else

814
00:45:44,710 --> 00:45:50,180
mom its that I do I have no idea how
many people who are involved directly

815
00:45:50,180 --> 00:45:51,259
with the car line 0

816
00:45:51,260 --> 00:45:55,830
looking at the the recent read me files
which accompanied the latest versions

817
00:45:55,830 --> 00:45:56,500
the kernel

818
00:45:56,500 --> 00:46:01,750
there are literally a hundred to hundred
names analysts and this probably more

819
00:46:01,750 --> 00:46:05,490
people who may be collaborating then
only one person submits the changes

820
00:46:05,490 --> 00:46:09,160
reasons

821
00:46:09,160 --> 00:46:13,839
no no no this small essential registry
that things tend to go through line is I

822
00:46:13,840 --> 00:46:15,710
think on the seas got somebody else

823
00:46:15,710 --> 00:46:19,910
a managing that now but basically things
get registered with him

824
00:46:19,910 --> 00:46:23,790
and he'll put it into the official title
now they're that said there or

825
00:46:23,790 --> 00:46:27,570
other that changes to the kernel which
can be added

826
00:46:27,570 --> 00:46:32,400
I'll and were nearly as Linus doesn't
decide to put them in the kernel you'll

827
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:33,330
find them

828
00:46:33,330 --> 00:46:38,130
%uh on the side for example saline is
decided not to include the so the on the

829
00:46:38,130 --> 00:46:41,100
FTP site may be any of the would-be
directories

830
00:46:41,100 --> 00:46:46,020
on and they can be installed ordinarily
though they are very specific to a given

831
00:46:46,020 --> 00:46:48,509
revision number the colonel and if you
try

832
00:46:48,510 --> 00:46:51,680
installing them on some other vision
it's it's a crapshoot

833
00:46:51,680 --> 00:46:54,950
so getting into the kernel is probably
the best

834
00:46:54,950 --> 00:46:58,180
way of saying it you know continue
continuing

835
00:46:58,180 --> 00:47:01,049
means

836
00:47:01,049 --> 00:47:03,690
in moons you

837
00:47:03,690 --> 00:47:04,910
things

838
00:47:04,910 --> 00:47:06,440
maybe

839
00:47:06,440 --> 00:47:10,760
your shins morning

840
00:47:10,760 --> 00:47:14,610
this we better get kicked out but

841
00:47:14,610 --> 00:47:17,920
but having thinking said go ahead but

842
00:47:17,920 --> 00:47:20,349
you human said yo

843
00:47:20,349 --> 00:47:27,210
when you take over and after removing oh
and balloons

844
00:47:27,210 --> 00:47:31,249
given that we're both to get kicked out
in this is a user group meeting is

845
00:47:31,249 --> 00:47:34,460
let's meet outside dead people a cake
third

846
00:47:34,460 --> 00:47:38,059
when you pronounce your last name
through very hockenberry as well as

847
00:47:38,059 --> 00:47:42,170
Michael Johnson will be around outside
to you can debate

848
00:47:42,170 --> 00:47:45,950
technical questions with I'd be four
though we get kicked out here in a

849
00:47:45,950 --> 00:47:47,849
couple questions I just want you

850
00:47:47,849 --> 00:47:50,900
and my own curiosity on the thing

851
00:47:50,900 --> 00:47:54,470
the people who are using Linux how many
people that ignited

852
00:47:54,470 --> 00:47:58,619
down of the net okay

853
00:47:58,619 --> 00:48:03,029
no another interesting when that I keep
feeling constantly

854
00:48:03,029 --> 00:48:07,460
is how many people are considering are
either are using Linux or are

855
00:48:07,460 --> 00:48:09,089
considering using Linux

856
00:48:09,089 --> 00:48:15,690
in some form a professional environment
by that and I he made broadly defined in

857
00:48:15,690 --> 00:48:16,950
the either as

858
00:48:16,950 --> 00:48:21,700
selling services by connecting people to
the network connecting machines into

859
00:48:21,700 --> 00:48:22,239
their

860
00:48:22,239 --> 00:48:26,200
UNIX network at work here that can do
things

861
00:48:26,200 --> 00:48:30,769
interesting this is an in general it
again being in the marketing businesses

862
00:48:30,769 --> 00:48:34,049
PC Unix products in Linux generally owed

863
00:48:34,049 --> 00:48:38,140
it's the constant skepticism we get up
high end users think

864
00:48:38,140 --> 00:48:41,269
you know but it's not really a
professional product in people are

865
00:48:41,269 --> 00:48:45,609
really using it through her mission
critical applications and what's

866
00:48:45,609 --> 00:48:46,369
fascinating

867
00:48:46,369 --> 00:48:51,289
just as a little anecdote it's a movie
me a free already and we as I did

868
00:48:51,289 --> 00:48:56,249
uniforms in March walking by the ID GE

869
00:48:56,249 --> 00:48:59,769
people who publish Computerworld to do a
lot of market research in this woman

870
00:48:59,769 --> 00:49:01,469
jumped up from behind the counter

871
00:49:01,469 --> 00:49:05,999
sees my badge at that time saying when
external it says we know but this limit

872
00:49:05,999 --> 00:49:06,440
stuff

873
00:49:06,440 --> 00:49:11,599
and the so here we chatted for a bit you
brent was in charge of a survey that I D

874
00:49:11,599 --> 00:49:12,390
G do you

875
00:49:12,390 --> 00:49:15,710
and every the compliments I'll

876
00:49:15,710 --> 00:49:18,769
use various different versions of Linux

877
00:49:18,769 --> 00:49:22,769
on a units that is I in commercial
accounts they send these out to base

878
00:49:22,769 --> 00:49:25,170
presidents have MIAs these are the
places

879
00:49:25,170 --> 00:49:29,619
I'm then she got the significant Radian

880
00:49:29,619 --> 00:49:33,650
component a these MIAs directors
admitting to using

881
00:49:33,650 --> 00:49:38,079
linens as their new operating system
that they were implementing

882
00:49:38,079 --> 00:49:44,549
on their units know him as a cause im
the exact the edge she was at the

883
00:49:44,549 --> 00:49:48,519
me so she was asking me things like well
who's selling this stuff and where is it

884
00:49:48,519 --> 00:49:49,130
everytime

885
00:49:49,130 --> 00:49:53,700
its and what's the 1-800 number for
their marketing to burn

886
00:49:53,700 --> 00:49:57,789
manager you explain your that it was
well let Linus Torvald is in charge the

887
00:49:57,789 --> 00:50:01,979
kernel inbio various other guys are in
charge in different parts omit Ned

888
00:50:01,979 --> 00:50:06,599
okay so with the phone number mandated
trying to explain to her that she needed

889
00:50:06,599 --> 00:50:08,499
in internet connection to you

890
00:50:08,499 --> 00:50:12,339
to get all these people that it's
probably the most interesting aspect

891
00:50:12,339 --> 00:50:13,390
limits is this step

892
00:50:13,390 --> 00:50:17,819
really works it's really stable in the
PC in its showing up literally

893
00:50:17,819 --> 00:50:18,880
everywhere

894
00:50:18,880 --> 00:50:22,349
know so if you can't get your questions
answered by a

895
00:50:22,349 --> 00:50:25,479
kirdar Michael the or someone else here

896
00:50:25,479 --> 00:50:29,219
you can certainly get your questions
answered on the net say

897
00:50:29,219 --> 00:50:33,819
you know in the Linux News Group com dot
OS dot1x

898
00:50:33,819 --> 00:50:38,979
diet announcements help in development
and then of course there's the Linux

899
00:50:38,979 --> 00:50:39,609
journal

900
00:50:39,609 --> 00:50:43,180
and then there's user group literally
all over the country springing up

901
00:50:43,180 --> 00:50:45,490
dreams

902
00:50:45,490 --> 00:50:49,840
means went through that that but that's
been true with UNIX

903
00:50:49,840 --> 00:50:53,010
all along okay well

904
00:50:53,010 --> 00:50:58,480
thanks very much for coming and thank
you michael kors the cost

905
00:50:58,480 --> 00:51:02,710
the

906
00:51:02,710 --> 00:51:06,930
the

907
00:51:06,930 --> 00:51:13,930
the

908
00:51:14,050 --> 00:51:15,579
money

909
00:51:15,579 --> 00:51:15,829
not
