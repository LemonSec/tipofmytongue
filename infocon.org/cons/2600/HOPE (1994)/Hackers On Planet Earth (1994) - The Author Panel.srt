solace

43
00:04:02,469 --> 00:04:06,519

00:04:51,990 --> 00:04:55,710
anyway

51
00:04:55,710 --> 00:04:56,989
total

52
00:04:56,990 --> 00:05:01,650
one issue

53
00:05:01,650 --> 00:05:04,439
better there

54
00:05:04,439 --> 00:05:09,680
taxes not so much technological stuff
what's interesting about hackers fifties

55
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:12,370
itself

56
00:05:12,370 --> 00:05:16,550
packing freaking as a subculture that's
where i came from a story about writing

57
00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:17,669
um...

58
00:05:17,669 --> 00:05:18,508
about

59
00:05:18,509 --> 00:05:21,110
i started reading music criticism

60
00:05:21,110 --> 00:05:22,479
ide became

61
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:25,758
increasingly disinterested with that

62
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:29,139
convinced it was really exciting

63
00:05:29,139 --> 00:05:34,220
in terms of subculture of activity in my
generation

64
00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:41,220
was uh... cultures a worker incoherent
talking specifically

65
00:05:43,319 --> 00:05:50,319
and up

66
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:55,039
but once i got to know the cultural
better

67
00:05:55,039 --> 00:05:57,520
eve the realtor problematic

68
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:59,639
i dealt with writing about

69
00:05:59,639 --> 00:06:02,259
this is walking

70
00:06:02,259 --> 00:06:03,769
between

71
00:06:03,769 --> 00:06:05,929
making a case for the breakthrough

72
00:06:05,929 --> 00:06:10,949
too difficult for the right of the
subculture to exist

73
00:06:10,949 --> 00:06:17,360
the subculture that civilians

74
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:20,949
you know i would like to

75
00:06:20,949 --> 00:06:22,929
you know you all know that

76
00:06:22,929 --> 00:06:25,479
hackers are

77
00:06:25,479 --> 00:06:29,748
all twelve of their mothers are
wonderful people

78
00:06:29,749 --> 00:06:31,949
of

79
00:06:31,949 --> 00:06:33,199
but uh...

80
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:36,840
established a summing hackers are human
beings like everybody else but the

81
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:39,519
problem is writing about them takes
place

82
00:06:39,519 --> 00:06:42,379
we have a general atmosphere of total

83
00:06:42,379 --> 00:06:45,769
misunderstanding and fear and terror

84
00:06:45,769 --> 00:06:48,879
and

85
00:06:48,879 --> 00:06:50,030
too right

86
00:06:50,030 --> 00:06:54,169
the subculture does it really is

87
00:06:54,169 --> 00:06:57,770
is problematic because he'll just be
skiing into these prejudices against

88
00:06:57,770 --> 00:06:59,539
them and you won't really

89
00:06:59,539 --> 00:07:02,849
make the case for the support of it says
no i believe that the suppose

90
00:07:02,849 --> 00:07:07,889
resurrected system needs to exist
because i'm interested

91
00:07:07,889 --> 00:07:11,580
for one thing some of the political
implications of subculture

92
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:17,339
he decided to break through corporate
barriers

93
00:07:17,339 --> 00:07:22,740
information hierarchy sam

94
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:24,080
of listen up

95
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:25,849
controls information

96
00:07:25,850 --> 00:07:26,930
dedication

97
00:07:26,930 --> 00:07:33,389
planted in this increasingly information
based citing army

98
00:07:33,389 --> 00:07:35,029
actress

99
00:07:35,029 --> 00:07:39,150
are generally is interested in these
political questions as some of us

100
00:07:39,150 --> 00:07:40,740
journalists are

101
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:42,699
side some of you are here

102
00:07:42,699 --> 00:07:47,880
tonight up

103
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:51,370
nonetheless for those reasons i think
it's important for the same

104
00:07:51,370 --> 00:07:53,460
exist

105
00:07:53,460 --> 00:07:54,819
well i think it was

106
00:07:54,819 --> 00:07:56,729
advocacy journalism

107
00:07:56,729 --> 00:07:59,508
i support for the hacker subculture

108
00:07:59,509 --> 00:08:02,410
i try to present it

109
00:08:02,410 --> 00:08:04,419
as accurately as possible

110
00:08:04,419 --> 00:08:07,568
but when it comes down to a i'm making a
choice to be

111
00:08:07,569 --> 00:08:10,039
hackers sympathetic

112
00:08:10,039 --> 00:08:11,209
this early proactive

113
00:08:11,209 --> 00:08:12,750
at least sent them

114
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:16,279
in the best like that i can

115
00:08:16,279 --> 00:08:23,279
amicus or just because i hear a lot you
know it but it is a lot of suspicion

116
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:25,579
patrick community and

117
00:08:25,579 --> 00:08:28,839
rightfully so

118
00:08:28,839 --> 00:08:31,759
but there's a kind of attitude alike

119
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:34,820
you know one of the justice system where
we are going on

120
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:36,870
also

121
00:08:36,870 --> 00:08:38,590
and it's not

122
00:08:38,590 --> 00:08:40,580
you know it's difficult lately

123
00:08:40,580 --> 00:08:43,800
present he works at all

124
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:47,970
and just illustrate presentation people
are gonna hitler out there will always

125
00:08:47,970 --> 00:08:51,680
prejudice against acting retain their
discovery into that

126
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:56,880
whether prejudices are already so we
have to make a case for the n_

127
00:08:56,880 --> 00:09:00,360
and that also pittsburgh pa one do you
all

128
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:04,279
to also make a case for some time to sit
there and pictures

129
00:09:04,279 --> 00:09:06,360
just few out information

130
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:08,920
to outline and spew out information any

131
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:11,040
immediately at that comes along

132
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:14,780
or on the other hand totally not talk to
anybody about the council on his cut

133
00:09:14,780 --> 00:09:16,000
that copy

134
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,940
uh... there's talk about this now

135
00:09:18,940 --> 00:09:23,410
on the one hand it's real dogmatic
meteorologists thanks

136
00:09:23,410 --> 00:09:29,150
until the other hand he noticed a case
uh...

137
00:09:29,150 --> 00:09:30,420
hackers who will just

138
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:31,228
religious

139
00:09:31,229 --> 00:09:36,280
spewed out all kinds incriminating
information

140
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:39,640
yet reporters have never talked to david
never seen before anything that's

141
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:43,230
certainly know that there really report
is not just here for hours in a lot of

142
00:09:43,230 --> 00:09:46,780
business and that

143
00:09:46,780 --> 00:09:51,290
you have to develop more sad attitude
towards towards dealing with the press

144
00:09:51,290 --> 00:09:52,439
not just

145
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:53,660
on the one hand

146
00:09:53,660 --> 00:09:54,870
yet they're all

147
00:09:54,870 --> 00:09:57,750
uh... creates a transaction hahaha

148
00:09:57,750 --> 00:10:03,570
and or on the other hand that you know
you can just present the information

149
00:10:03,570 --> 00:10:07,170
once the information gets out there and
everybody will know it wonderful thing

150
00:10:07,170 --> 00:10:11,060
hacking freaking is and how wonderful
you people are and

151
00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:17,270
you know you're right to exist will be
guaranteed for life

152
00:10:17,270 --> 00:10:21,060
you guys develop kind of setting i
developed the kind of political attitude

153
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:23,360
about making

154
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:26,030
making changes for yourselves

155
00:10:26,030 --> 00:10:28,030
i don't want to honor

156
00:10:28,030 --> 00:10:29,970
or past my

157
00:10:29,970 --> 00:10:34,190
dot blot questions afterwards

158
00:10:34,190 --> 00:10:37,650
do you ask him

159
00:10:37,650 --> 00:10:38,720
i am

160
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:42,680
despite his denials helpful questions
i'm not sure exactly

161
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:45,670
uh... what kind of questions you guys
want me to answered so

162
00:10:45,670 --> 00:10:47,010
let's let's leave it up

163
00:10:47,010 --> 00:10:50,450
what my expenses for

164
00:10:50,450 --> 00:10:51,260
off a bit

165
00:10:51,260 --> 00:10:53,260
actors and and

166
00:10:53,260 --> 00:10:55,640
more planted asking questions of the
country

167
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:57,670
uh... i first

168
00:10:57,670 --> 00:11:00,260
what what is difference between the
infants mother

169
00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:03,470
tells us that apparently done much in
the last

170
00:11:03,470 --> 00:11:05,300
three four years

171
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:06,370
partly that's because i'm

172
00:11:06,370 --> 00:11:09,170
none of the computer report

173
00:11:09,170 --> 00:11:10,910
sorta like giulio myself

174
00:11:10,910 --> 00:11:13,490
lam reporter much more as a reporter on

175
00:11:13,490 --> 00:11:17,370
cultures and groups

176
00:11:17,370 --> 00:11:20,240
when i first became interested in them

177
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:21,330
attackers was

178
00:11:21,330 --> 00:11:23,210
in nineteen eighty nine twenty two

179
00:11:23,210 --> 00:11:28,320
about sent a pic of major point six
hundred and

180
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:29,850
sign up for the world

181
00:11:29,850 --> 00:11:31,960
concern exploring both of those worlds

182
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:35,590
the first thing that it was around an
editor of harper's magazine immediately

183
00:11:35,590 --> 00:11:38,960
form

184
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:40,620
in february nineteen ninety

185
00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:42,050
which we got a lot of

186
00:11:42,050 --> 00:11:45,280
with largely with meals help to get a
lot of

187
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:47,610
people on the well

188
00:11:47,610 --> 00:11:50,930
together to discuss

189
00:11:50,930 --> 00:11:54,550
when we get it was his computer hacking
chronic and attend a four

190
00:11:54,550 --> 00:11:55,950
online

191
00:11:55,950 --> 00:11:59,580
in which another

192
00:11:59,580 --> 00:12:04,040
discussion try to ask questions and see
if there was such a thing to happen

193
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:08,819
spreads the word of the people drew the
line

194
00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:10,660
this uh...

195
00:12:10,660 --> 00:12:14,610
this belongs mostly pins permanently in
nc

196
00:12:14,610 --> 00:12:16,530
to people who would go on to the

197
00:12:16,530 --> 00:12:20,860
even bigger figures need capital
fiber-optic and john perry barlow

198
00:12:20,860 --> 00:12:23,140
who uh... sort of had a generational

199
00:12:23,140 --> 00:12:25,470
uh... war going on

200
00:12:25,470 --> 00:12:27,490
it led to

201
00:12:27,490 --> 00:12:30,149
claim the topic with basically no
different from here

202
00:12:30,149 --> 00:12:31,750
escape order

203
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:34,400
immediately after that optic

204
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:36,750
grabbed his credit rating t_r_w_

205
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:39,740
download it can be informed

206
00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:44,190
that there was a bit of difference
between the skateboard

207
00:12:44,190 --> 00:12:46,520
so an indian

208
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:48,329
but not to mention answered

209
00:12:48,330 --> 00:12:50,690
that i was very different way too

210
00:12:50,690 --> 00:12:55,150
present packers

211
00:12:55,150 --> 00:12:58,569
i think works just because we let

212
00:12:58,570 --> 00:13:00,490
talk in the worst read

213
00:13:00,490 --> 00:13:01,920
interfered very

214
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:03,630
behavior as little as possible

215
00:13:03,630 --> 00:13:10,130
opposition of most of the words that
ended up in that article

216
00:13:10,130 --> 00:13:12,689
so that we hope it was

217
00:13:12,690 --> 00:13:14,750
you guys into words because we just

218
00:13:14,750 --> 00:13:16,350
use your own words

219
00:13:16,350 --> 00:13:18,800
the fundamental of

220
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:22,940
teenage computer hackers

221
00:13:22,940 --> 00:13:25,130
started hanging out with them

222
00:13:25,130 --> 00:13:28,100
try to figure out more about what lead
someone

223
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:30,940
at a young age to watch

224
00:13:30,940 --> 00:13:34,860
started reading this article

225
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:37,450
from amman jacket

226
00:13:37,450 --> 00:13:38,820
and

227
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:40,660
basically what we did was sort of

228
00:13:40,660 --> 00:13:44,520
apprentice ourselves to these two guests
and got them to teach us

229
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:46,110
everything that

230
00:13:46,110 --> 00:13:50,970
possibly understand what happened

231
00:13:50,970 --> 00:13:53,160
remain very there was that

232
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:54,810
uh... work

233
00:13:54,810 --> 00:13:57,180
miles ahead of us and most the time we
just

234
00:13:57,180 --> 00:13:59,400
we're trying to get them to slow down if
we could

235
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:03,560
we can keep track of it

236
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:07,030
we hung out with him for a long time
coming up from july three months

237
00:14:07,030 --> 00:14:10,290
thomas the time we were having dinner
with them

238
00:14:10,290 --> 00:14:14,150
figured system security specialist
informs us tonight

239
00:14:14,150 --> 00:14:17,740
uh... and it was a explained was what
they were doing why they were doing

240
00:14:17,740 --> 00:14:20,220
comment over the course of that

241
00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:22,380
we sort of learned

242
00:14:22,380 --> 00:14:25,050
we we can to some conclusions but why

243
00:14:25,050 --> 00:14:27,920
why they were doing some conclusions
that they should have had come to

244
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:29,920
themselves

245
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:32,080
and we will make it to psychoanalyze

246
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:37,530
a bit was that

247
00:14:37,530 --> 00:14:39,530
that's what it means for me

248
00:14:39,530 --> 00:14:42,889
packers this money to uh... to
contributions to the day

249
00:14:42,889 --> 00:14:47,640
really the only thing that valentine's
day fifty two

250
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:49,220
to stay with you and said that

251
00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:53,100
thing and while i'm here with the
national public radio reporter here

252
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:54,210
talking to a few people

253
00:14:54,210 --> 00:14:54,990
yesterday

254
00:14:54,990 --> 00:14:55,779
something

255
00:14:55,779 --> 00:14:57,740
missile strikes me watching people

256
00:14:57,740 --> 00:15:01,310
there were a couple talker ferguson
photographers study lined up for some

257
00:15:01,310 --> 00:15:02,800
people in bethlehem

258
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:06,830
and uh... and indian people taking
pictures

259
00:15:06,830 --> 00:15:08,910
they really seem to be a

260
00:15:08,910 --> 00:15:12,689
despite despite the fact that you and
said that that there's this

261
00:15:12,690 --> 00:15:15,790
content and you better

262
00:15:15,790 --> 00:15:19,599
it was a real feeling of black when the
partnership for peace

263
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:21,580
smiled

264
00:15:21,580 --> 00:15:24,650
but that they're going to get stressed
by the media

265
00:15:24,650 --> 00:15:27,209
and and i think is a real

266
00:15:27,210 --> 00:15:29,780
there's a real distinction between
different types of

267
00:15:29,780 --> 00:15:32,959
reporters uh... for people that are
going to really listen to

268
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:36,170
what do you have to say that i
understand the technology trends and

269
00:15:36,170 --> 00:15:37,360
sociology

270
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:38,850
um... and i think

271
00:15:38,850 --> 00:15:41,220
are gonna write articles that that

272
00:15:41,220 --> 00:15:44,200
health and on her

273
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:45,590
again

274
00:15:45,590 --> 00:15:49,460
a sixteen-year-old girl here yesterday
told me that he

275
00:15:49,460 --> 00:15:51,210
read my article and got him

276
00:15:51,210 --> 00:15:52,860
more interesting happening

277
00:15:52,860 --> 00:15:54,809
dance high school library and that's

278
00:15:54,809 --> 00:15:56,780
that's the best in the months of
uncertainty but

279
00:15:56,780 --> 00:15:58,290
oracle was absurd

280
00:15:58,290 --> 00:15:59,790
well i was hoping would happen

281
00:15:59,790 --> 00:16:02,079
simply things can come from from

282
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:03,950
talking terms but

283
00:16:03,950 --> 00:16:05,339
when you get the brawling show

284
00:16:05,339 --> 00:16:06,360
showing up

285
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:07,820
and uh...

286
00:16:07,820 --> 00:16:09,770
asking if you could break into

287
00:16:09,770 --> 00:16:11,790
defense department computers and

288
00:16:11,790 --> 00:16:15,680
launch i_c_b_m_'s things like that

289
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:18,499
did you get a bigger pretty early
there's no way

290
00:16:18,499 --> 00:16:20,850
anything good can help

291
00:16:20,850 --> 00:16:23,250
you've gotta keep

292
00:16:23,250 --> 00:16:27,400
you've got a lot of things we don't have
to say nothing signal

293
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:29,940
companies could really seems like that's
something that

294
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:31,100
a lot of hackers

295
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:34,970
knuckles

296
00:16:34,970 --> 00:16:41,970
them to participate in anything

297
00:16:42,150 --> 00:16:43,620
as some people in that can be

298
00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:48,530
gergen

299
00:16:48,530 --> 00:16:51,480
bogelindah

300
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:53,480
esteemed colleagues on the left

301
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:55,960
both left your word for it

302
00:16:55,960 --> 00:17:01,020
exert myself to be journalist who say
consider myself to be a brighter

303
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:02,810
commentator

304
00:17:02,810 --> 00:17:05,030
editorial big mouth

305
00:17:05,030 --> 00:17:08,220
hopefully somewhat entertaining for like
you to meet

306
00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:12,630
crossovers and areas of their dreams as
soon as being

307
00:17:12,630 --> 00:17:15,290
phone companies being the pentagon

308
00:17:15,290 --> 00:17:16,700
whoever socials

309
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:19,830
uphold retirement system tried to

310
00:17:19,829 --> 00:17:24,179
made some sort of transitions or provide
some material for people to build a

311
00:17:24,180 --> 00:17:26,620
understand what's going on the other
side is an awful lot of

312
00:17:26,620 --> 00:17:29,420
misunderstandings or something going on

313
00:17:29,420 --> 00:17:32,470
and i think also this field but also see
is a great deal of

314
00:17:32,470 --> 00:17:35,600
boring boring writing going on

315
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:37,740
and entertaining eats and fun

316
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:41,600
and here's the bottom of a lot of potter
for that as far as i'm concerned

317
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:44,669
uh... febrile a speech they do in cyber
christ

318
00:17:44,669 --> 00:17:47,739
we'll have some idea of what we're doing
an enormous

319
00:17:47,739 --> 00:17:53,190
that review of this conference will
sacrifice gets nailed to the cross

320
00:17:53,190 --> 00:17:56,420
so hopefully will be the experience of
some of the others have been

321
00:17:56,420 --> 00:18:00,120
but you guys are not the bad guys the
media sometime this week with it that's

322
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:04,850
our report for america doesn't want to
go for the future and paid usd

323
00:18:04,850 --> 00:18:08,149
acknowledgements contributes to the
personal feelings in the event

324
00:18:08,150 --> 00:18:09,840
immediately rhetoric that

325
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:13,449
we hear going on

326
00:18:13,450 --> 00:18:17,360
all of the closing sadler sort of some
of the packers mark understand exactly

327
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:21,870
what to do occurred with fiber optic
couple days africa bust on the latest

328
00:18:21,870 --> 00:18:23,370
round

329

and i want to talk to him so i

330
00:18:25,090 --> 00:18:27,169

331
00:18:27,170 --> 00:18:29,720
and because of the same sort of a chat
with you

332
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:32,270
how to get my phone

333
00:18:32,270 --> 00:18:35,330

337
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:45,668
be

338
00:18:45,669 --> 00:18:47,970
because of many more trouble because you
have an answer

339
00:18:47,970 --> 00:18:51,549
but before we go with the stars one
question

340
00:18:51,549 --> 00:18:54,129
warranted it

341
00:18:54,130 --> 00:18:56,530
four hours on the record conversation

342
00:18:56,530 --> 00:18:57,850
thoroughly enjoyed it

343
00:18:57,850 --> 00:18:59,740
he did not understand

344
00:18:59,740 --> 00:19:00,760
and a lot of

345
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:03,990
whose fault it does not understand

346
00:19:03,990 --> 00:19:08,530
when people go on a regular army they
don't understand what off the record is

347
00:19:08,530 --> 00:19:11,559
that we don't understand offered what
background is

348
00:19:11,559 --> 00:19:15,240
houston's anonymously let me read to
your onesies and

349
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:19,070
according to sources will be identified
the blues dot the white house

350
00:19:19,070 --> 00:19:22,600
the same kind of thing you have the same
privileges and rules and quality

351
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:25,840
journalist quality writers will appear
to those

352
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:30,189
types of rules regardless of what side
of things you may or may not be wrong

353
00:19:30,190 --> 00:19:32,590
and all of the better writers will

354
00:19:32,590 --> 00:19:34,639
keep confidential your secrets

355
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:39,040
anarchy confidential the secret of the
pentagon and all the other server level

356
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:40,490
of people as well

357
00:19:40,490 --> 00:19:44,720
so we will do the same through everybody
but you don't wherewithal ruled really

358
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:47,580
or

359
00:19:47,580 --> 00:19:48,879
with the issue about

360
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:50,240
hacking

361
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:52,309
somehow

362
00:19:52,309 --> 00:19:55,750
business impression of the tracking his
movement

363
00:19:55,750 --> 00:20:00,060
that is so uh... something that's run
last four years or ten years when i do

364
00:20:00,060 --> 00:20:01,240
but i did

365
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:05,520
i'm craig wintom technologies been
around for a long time

366
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:08,510
and people have always tried to stretch
technology

367
00:20:08,510 --> 00:20:10,030
and push the edge of it

368
00:20:10,030 --> 00:20:12,940
the difference that we have today versus
the other types

369
00:20:12,940 --> 00:20:17,880
happened prior technological society
connectivity there's a real difference

370
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:21,260
and when you have the kind of work to do
we have to break the presents the

371
00:20:21,260 --> 00:20:22,490
awareness

372
00:20:22,490 --> 00:20:24,140
is the main different

373
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:27,679
people always push the edge and we're
pushing the edge of john wooden for

374
00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:28,910
social good

375
00:20:28,910 --> 00:20:30,460
and this is not

376
00:20:30,460 --> 00:20:33,500
something that the media in my opinion
has really gotten right

377
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:36,980
there's a majority of the new york i
read the stories on the rise of various

378
00:20:36,980 --> 00:20:39,440
factions of the security industry

379
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:43,330
they didn't want to removes do not have
a technological basis

380
00:20:43,330 --> 00:20:47,250
general no fans with some of my wife to
determine time of the technological

381
00:20:47,250 --> 00:20:48,850
basis to understand

382
00:20:48,850 --> 00:20:52,690
when somebody's beloved children were
not as a possible is it not possible

383
00:20:52,690 --> 00:20:56,190
and i'll give you the most part of
example than our past michael

384
00:20:56,190 --> 00:21:01,250
on january tenth nineteen ninety two

385
00:21:01,250 --> 00:21:02,450
ted koppel

386
00:21:02,450 --> 00:21:03,990
was post tonight

387
00:21:03,990 --> 00:21:07,160
when i was sitting there with my wife
level lathem kids of all that we were

388
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:09,510
sitting at home at eleven thirty

389
00:21:09,510 --> 00:21:12,040
and he came on to announce

390
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:15,340
that the united states had won the war

391
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:16,399
abused and raw

392
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:19,790
using a computer virus

393
00:21:19,790 --> 00:21:23,870
by both of my life isn't there something
wrong with this picture

394
00:21:23,870 --> 00:21:26,640
and they proceeded to describe how it
works

395
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:28,060
and what it was

396
00:21:28,060 --> 00:21:31,379
the national security agency in his
infinite wisdom

397
00:21:31,380 --> 00:21:35,720
design a computer virus to go inside but
shipped

398
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:38,179
which they've engaged in the c_r_a_

399
00:21:38,179 --> 00:21:42,570
socioeconomic salute your trip

400
00:21:42,570 --> 00:21:44,389
designed to take them off

401
00:21:44,390 --> 00:21:48,640
they fly over to france and they find a
french better cos all this fits into

402
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:50,580
that and they put this ship

403
00:21:50,580 --> 00:21:54,000
with the words into a freshman

404
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,380
the fresh powder

405
00:21:55,380 --> 00:21:59,649
is apparently down three brought one way
or another

406
00:21:59,649 --> 00:22:04,159
and residents but went on this story
with u_s_ news world report

407
00:22:04,159 --> 00:22:08,899
providing will be accurate information

408
00:22:08,899 --> 00:22:12,400
they got the printer to amman jordan

409
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:15,710
and since it was an embargo that we
won't let the printers with the virus is

410
00:22:15,710 --> 00:22:17,610
through

411
00:22:17,610 --> 00:22:22,860
and they don't know about this printer
into iraqi air defense installation down

412
00:22:22,860 --> 00:22:24,800
near kuwait

413
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:29,020
so i'll call amanda's before we decide
to send in the cruise missiles to make

414
00:22:29,020 --> 00:22:32,530
right turns of yours you no doubt

415
00:22:32,530 --> 00:22:34,080
we decided

416
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:37,689
it's time to launch the virus

417
00:22:37,690 --> 00:22:39,870
political forums that go

418
00:22:39,870 --> 00:22:41,270
the fireworks

419
00:22:41,270 --> 00:22:43,700
this is not likely

420
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:44,850
jobs

421
00:22:44,850 --> 00:22:48,830
uh... of the printer

422
00:22:48,830 --> 00:22:50,070
into

423
00:22:50,070 --> 00:22:53,080
the air defense radar systems protrude

424
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:55,449
which are running windows three point
lead over

425
00:22:55,450 --> 00:23:02,450
and

426
00:23:02,770 --> 00:23:04,700
and subsequently made welcome

427
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:08,910
alderson scapegoats

428
00:23:08,910 --> 00:23:14,750
i was bothered by this story

429
00:23:14,750 --> 00:23:18,429
specify what it means that i had some
homework to do and i have a personal

430
00:23:18,429 --> 00:23:22,970
files religious draw out the back my
mind

431
00:23:22,970 --> 00:23:26,549
and suddenly i wouldn't normally

432
00:23:26,549 --> 00:23:29,870
all the iraqi virus hoax

433
00:23:29,870 --> 00:23:36,000
this story word for word point for point
issued particulars fourteen unfolded

434
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,860
documented on whether or not

435
00:23:38,860 --> 00:23:42,030
was written originally by job gains

436
00:23:42,030 --> 00:23:47,950
in the world columnist under people
versus unseemly

437
00:23:47,950 --> 00:23:51,750
it was an april fool's joke

438
00:23:51,750 --> 00:23:55,840
one who becomes the question so i pulled
out the following monday morning after

439
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:59,949
talking to problems people who disavowed
any knowledge of it

440
00:23:59,950 --> 00:24:03,830
perhaps whatever reporting it

441
00:24:03,830 --> 00:24:07,980
thoughts of the author brian duffy of
u_s_ news world report was that brian

442
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:11,520
the stands approx what happened

443
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:15,620
and apparently i sent him something of a
panic holding back two days later he

444
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:20,180
says we're standing by our story
extractors

445
00:24:20,180 --> 00:24:21,250
presented

446
00:24:21,250 --> 00:24:23,870
where it is your source he goes

447
00:24:23,870 --> 00:24:29,010
tumhala old temple

448
00:24:29,010 --> 00:24:33,129
whatsoever knowledgeable general
somewhat remote will meet up point is

449
00:24:33,130 --> 00:24:36,870
because what we're talking to him on the
left to right be aware of the rule be

450
00:24:36,870 --> 00:24:40,040
aware of your rights that good
journalists will be a good

451
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:47,040
and ready to start ordering some stories
of your viewpoints burke was right

452
00:24:51,269 --> 00:24:53,550
about changes what should happen is

453
00:24:53,550 --> 00:24:57,780
relatively late

454
00:24:57,780 --> 00:24:59,450
off that

455
00:24:59,450 --> 00:25:01,210
under the head

456
00:25:01,210 --> 00:25:02,730
it's the release of backbeat

457
00:25:02,730 --> 00:25:07,450
last year i was looking at numbers
scripts i didn't think i was in a coma

458
00:25:07,450 --> 00:25:08,750
uh... i had

459
00:25:08,750 --> 00:25:11,160
small pet projects in life

460
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:13,599
filter all that i was uh... i think that

461
00:25:13,599 --> 00:25:15,429
it off the ground

462
00:25:15,430 --> 00:25:18,720
but the thing that appeals to me about
the script

463
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:21,960
standout reasonable all the others i was
being offered

464
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:24,550
uh... screwdriver

465
00:25:24,550 --> 00:25:26,330
of was

466
00:25:26,330 --> 00:25:27,490
inside it

467
00:25:27,490 --> 00:25:28,990
had a sense of humor

468
00:25:28,990 --> 00:25:30,970
that was based on

469
00:25:30,970 --> 00:25:33,340
kindest delinquency

470
00:25:33,340 --> 00:25:34,669
uh...

471
00:25:34,669 --> 00:25:37,560
it had a similar things too

472
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:42,389
to the movie back beat a dismayed

473
00:25:42,390 --> 00:25:45,630
thing that really appealed to me was
that he was a tough he was a subculture

474
00:25:45,630 --> 00:25:47,390
thirsting for it

475
00:25:47,390 --> 00:25:48,920
pads

476
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:52,480
really threatening the scottish culture
in a way that

477
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:57,190
the star has got to move slowly up the
good and evil and was deficits unit but

478
00:25:57,190 --> 00:25:59,350
also the influenced by it

479
00:25:59,350 --> 00:26:02,680
uh... i think that preached generation

480
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:04,810
what uh...

481
00:26:04,810 --> 00:26:08,310
what is discovering things and you what
is working out

482
00:26:08,310 --> 00:26:09,350
re-routed

483
00:26:09,350 --> 00:26:12,760
uh... working out the rules that you
want to get by

484
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:16,460
disastrous receives actually concerned
whether it's

485
00:26:16,460 --> 00:26:22,210
drug experimentation or riding
motorbikes in the nineteen fifties or

486
00:26:22,210 --> 00:26:24,650
whatever

487
00:26:24,650 --> 00:26:29,410
it was really from abroad cultural

488
00:26:29,410 --> 00:26:32,040
hooted script but i also

489
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:33,440
just like the sense that

490
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:35,770
of polum anand

491
00:26:35,770 --> 00:26:37,410
disrespect the

492
00:26:37,410 --> 00:26:41,100
i think it's very healthy independent
the more i i don't know about

493
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:42,990
packing helps more i realize that

494
00:26:42,990 --> 00:26:44,419
that sort of

495
00:26:44,419 --> 00:26:46,050
absurdity of the world

496
00:26:46,050 --> 00:26:47,879
right isn't it ridiculous

497
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:50,210
that antibody costs of this stuff

498
00:26:50,210 --> 00:26:51,820
everybody

499
00:26:51,820 --> 00:26:55,740
shots of the computers either

500
00:26:55,740 --> 00:26:57,090
allowed to leave their life

501
00:26:57,090 --> 00:26:58,590
lullaby and

502
00:26:58,590 --> 00:27:01,420
the money that you say you have your
parents money have you come when

503
00:27:01,420 --> 00:27:04,650
somebody says you have this committed
this crime we haven't had that problem

504
00:27:04,650 --> 00:27:05,760
today

505
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:07,930
we've got his grade school

506
00:27:07,930 --> 00:27:09,150
request

507
00:27:09,150 --> 00:27:10,700
uh... i think uh...

508
00:27:10,700 --> 00:27:12,270
the mayor of that

509
00:27:12,270 --> 00:27:17,770
acting is hella society is not in using
but as uh...

510
00:27:17,770 --> 00:27:19,679
philip bruce ears but with us

511
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:22,590
as well

512
00:27:22,590 --> 00:27:23,900
i think

513
00:27:23,900 --> 00:27:24,730
rebuilt

514
00:27:24,730 --> 00:27:25,539
uh...

515
00:27:25,539 --> 00:27:28,140
put on the subject

516
00:27:28,140 --> 00:27:31,530
at the point of view of making a movie

517
00:27:31,530 --> 00:27:35,060
the question that arises as to how picky
treat

518
00:27:35,060 --> 00:27:36,950
a real-life situations

519
00:27:36,950 --> 00:27:39,360
uh... scripts

520
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:41,650
oversee borrows a lot of relations

521
00:27:41,650 --> 00:27:43,940
and real people

522
00:27:43,940 --> 00:27:45,700
in order the tickets

523
00:27:45,700 --> 00:27:49,840
it's enjoyable and painstaking maybe the
people i can see

524
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:51,170
um...

525
00:27:51,170 --> 00:27:52,450
but also

526
00:27:52,450 --> 00:27:55,360
that is going to be treated some waiters
subject matter

527
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:57,400
that's the

528
00:27:57,400 --> 00:28:00,760
the big question that that approaches

529
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:04,100
thanks people like like me who

530
00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:09,120
wanna make movies based on somewhere
real

531
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:15,250
uh... i had expressed in that there
isn't really any right old city

532
00:28:15,250 --> 00:28:18,140
granddaughters making backbeat

533
00:28:18,140 --> 00:28:20,330
uh... i love people one of us

534
00:28:20,330 --> 00:28:22,928
runs try to get the thoughts around

535
00:28:22,929 --> 00:28:26,710
accused of a story of fifty stuart
sutcliffe

536
00:28:26,710 --> 00:28:31,500
uh... these meshes with with john lennon
it's very sacred stories

537
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:33,590
in the sense

538
00:28:33,590 --> 00:28:36,600
very well documents upon real people
work

539
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:38,410
of the people were alive

540
00:28:38,410 --> 00:28:40,030
a lot of the

541
00:28:40,030 --> 00:28:42,160
uh... the story and document it

542
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:46,180
but i had to take meetings with with the
facts

543
00:28:46,180 --> 00:28:47,840
one of the things that i

544
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:49,789
was approaching festival

545
00:28:49,789 --> 00:28:51,629
uh... what i

546
00:28:51,630 --> 00:28:53,480
continual

547
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:56,720
started to think about researching this
this may be written

548
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:58,060
draft was

549
00:28:58,060 --> 00:29:01,980
reach do what i do know baki versus
absorb myself as much as i could

550
00:29:01,980 --> 00:29:03,560
the residuals

551
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:05,730
knowing about title head

552
00:29:05,730 --> 00:29:09,560
he did two years

553
00:29:09,560 --> 00:29:10,639
um...

554
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:12,430
i may try to use that

555
00:29:12,430 --> 00:29:14,230
knowledge to use

556
00:29:14,230 --> 00:29:17,990
to get the spirit of the baby bells

557
00:29:17,990 --> 00:29:21,460
bearing in mind that sounds good to have
to do

558
00:29:21,460 --> 00:29:23,730
dot thanks for that

559
00:29:23,730 --> 00:29:25,660
so it's really too

560
00:29:25,660 --> 00:29:27,970
two ways that i thought approach

561
00:29:27,970 --> 00:29:31,440
material going to find out what's what's
really out there and then find another

562
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:32,990
way bridge

563
00:29:32,990 --> 00:29:34,530
it could be presented

564
00:29:34,530 --> 00:29:35,770
for the screen

565
00:29:35,770 --> 00:29:37,350
that is true to that

566
00:29:37,350 --> 00:29:40,510
essence at the same time

567
00:29:40,510 --> 00:29:44,670
takes a lot

568
00:29:44,670 --> 00:29:48,740
ghmo

569
00:29:48,740 --> 00:29:52,519
as a major success how hackers ripped
off the ground originally it started out

570
00:29:52,519 --> 00:29:55,510
with a state of one of the things that
this would be a very much newspapers

571
00:29:55,510 --> 00:29:56,760
that was not

572
00:29:56,760 --> 00:30:00,760
originally developed at studio it wasn't
somebody saying capital port-au-prince

573
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:03,370
rollerblade movie kids are really into
that

574
00:30:03,370 --> 00:30:07,160
surfing etiquette that came back as a
result really the pictures that all the

575
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:11,480
way that israel origins were working for
anything when gratify my high school who

576
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:14,770
was studying mathematics her first year
college trophy

577
00:30:14,770 --> 00:30:18,700
into room in a lot of computers and it
was about

578
00:30:18,700 --> 00:30:24,260
ten o'clock in the evening and every
computer will still and workbooks

579
00:30:24,260 --> 00:30:30,580
and my first reaction was like one of
these people of the nation

580
00:30:30,580 --> 00:30:32,870
and i said to me too

581
00:30:32,870 --> 00:30:36,210
who supported him again and
insupportable role

582
00:30:36,210 --> 00:30:40,270
practice operates competitive games in
everything because it

583
00:30:40,270 --> 00:30:44,690
management everybody and was a big sign
on the walls of no cracking

584
00:30:44,690 --> 00:30:47,680
coddled consequences pretty high

585
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:50,820
that every monitors doing this work
isn't there some sort of monitors some

586
00:30:50,820 --> 00:30:56,210
things like that he's over there come a
crack in turkey

587
00:30:56,210 --> 00:31:00,380
and that was really sort of the
department uh... and seriously looking

588
00:31:00,380 --> 00:31:01,460
at

589
00:31:01,460 --> 00:31:02,500
everybody

590
00:31:02,500 --> 00:31:06,830
ended at this level of concentration i
think it's a little concentration

591
00:31:06,830 --> 00:31:13,040
great athletes get into the next level
concentration ethnic

592
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:16,470
dancing to some really great musical or
having great sex or having to do is just

593
00:31:16,470 --> 00:31:18,200
the flow state in that

594
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:24,880
that is what is starting to realize at
the time to place on that

595
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:26,330
that's when the germans

596
00:31:26,330 --> 00:31:27,780
we're going to write about

597
00:31:27,780 --> 00:31:31,629
because i i think that the pentagon's
recruiters from character remnant

598
00:31:31,629 --> 00:31:34,880
ultimate movie about a little bit

599
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:40,340
as time went on in the mornings came out
and i moved to new york and was

600
00:31:40,340 --> 00:31:46,030
always tracking stories about actors

601
00:31:46,030 --> 00:31:50,030
an influential articles point forensic
wasn't even sure that they were very

602
00:31:50,030 --> 00:31:55,670
partial to me in terms of looking at it
as it does it as a subculture

603
00:31:55,670 --> 00:32:00,450
and then wrote the script and and this
request what's called spec scripts

604
00:32:00,450 --> 00:32:01,530
peaking too right

605
00:32:01,530 --> 00:32:03,580
took two months off mike

606
00:32:03,580 --> 00:32:05,439
ships as a bartender in

607
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:10,150
and hung out with fiber optic and nasa
weakened

608
00:32:10,150 --> 00:32:12,290
and and

609
00:32:12,290 --> 00:32:14,470
for workers and very generous

610
00:32:14,470 --> 00:32:20,120
rivera ideas and the things that they've
been through

611
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:21,160
and during that time

612
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:25,140
the start of your growing sense of
responsibility towards the ideas look

613
00:32:25,140 --> 00:32:27,680
like he doesn't think that they think

614
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:29,350
i do think that uh... his

615
00:32:29,350 --> 00:32:32,930
present you guys that are kind of
advocacy journalism that's good

616
00:32:32,930 --> 00:32:35,130
there was a very management advocacy

617
00:32:35,130 --> 00:32:38,559
screenwriting in the sense because i was
just someone over part of a sense of

618
00:32:38,559 --> 00:32:40,220
humor and

619
00:32:40,220 --> 00:32:44,050
and politics and and and things that
they were trying to say and do

620
00:32:44,050 --> 00:32:47,019
very much agree

621
00:32:47,019 --> 00:32:49,130
the idea that the uh...

622
00:32:49,130 --> 00:32:54,240
but there's a responsibility on u_s_
happens to be present

623
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:57,590
when questions are asked to you by
journalist removal long period of time i

624
00:32:57,590 --> 00:33:04,590
was with the people i was working with a
solvent sample

625
00:33:05,110 --> 00:33:09,290
confession in the meantime as we hear
from forbes i saw that happen

626
00:33:09,290 --> 00:33:10,918
and and send them

627
00:33:10,919 --> 00:33:16,120
over all this stuff and just everything
and

628
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:20,899
you know you have to understand that
these people come here or

629
00:33:20,899 --> 00:33:22,600
which try to make a buck

630
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:25,310
and they're gonna try to come up with
the most dramatic

631
00:33:25,310 --> 00:33:26,860
significant monthly

632
00:33:26,860 --> 00:33:28,860
actor takes over satellite

633
00:33:28,860 --> 00:33:30,740
and stuff like that because that's

634
00:33:30,740 --> 00:33:34,730
then going back to the returns and all i
have been hearing on this story

635
00:33:34,730 --> 00:33:36,350
injury when when your life

636
00:33:36,350 --> 00:33:38,820
isn't very nice

637
00:33:38,820 --> 00:33:44,040
so where there is a two-way street bears
a responsibility at this point and said

638
00:33:44,040 --> 00:33:49,800
i mean talking

639
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:53,730
one thing i would say have a car about
this particular script

640
00:33:53,730 --> 00:33:56,950
which using very

641
00:33:56,950 --> 00:33:58,570
with michael

642
00:33:58,570 --> 00:34:02,060
as well was it when we finally started
to get their first office

643
00:34:02,060 --> 00:34:05,750
eastman first when i was several years
ago and hackensack exactly

644
00:34:05,750 --> 00:34:07,650
cutting edges like

645
00:34:07,650 --> 00:34:11,149
that it is now unmask persistent and
work experience that most reactions we

646
00:34:11,149 --> 00:34:15,138
got people without

647
00:34:15,139 --> 00:34:16,959
the interesting thing was that

648
00:34:16,958 --> 00:34:21,918
volume strong great visible

649
00:34:21,918 --> 00:34:26,598
interactive studios now making the film
under a previous regime

650
00:34:26,599 --> 00:34:28,960
had the peace covered by what's called
the story

651
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:31,249
through reader

652
00:34:31,249 --> 00:34:35,179
when it was working with us manage the
social engineer copy of that coverage

653
00:34:35,179 --> 00:34:39,479
wistful officers and his opinions

654
00:34:39,479 --> 00:34:40,819
this type of thing

655
00:34:40,819 --> 00:34:44,009
young republicans it's not really pissed
because uh... does not like the whole

656
00:34:44,009 --> 00:34:45,049
idea of

657
00:34:45,049 --> 00:34:47,159
having actresses protagonists and

658
00:34:47,159 --> 00:34:51,339
sort of introducing their view of the
world and how it works in life

659
00:34:51,339 --> 00:34:54,418
in a sense of we don't all become
hackers

660
00:34:54,418 --> 00:34:58,929
shirking our responsibility is
individuals incessant

661
00:34:58,929 --> 00:35:01,669
sometime later michael

662
00:35:01,669 --> 00:35:05,449
gave a script for particular studio head

663
00:35:05,449 --> 00:35:07,259
responded with the quote

664
00:35:07,259 --> 00:35:12,579
i'm uncomfortable with it
anti-establishment attitude

665
00:35:12,579 --> 00:35:16,359
and even though we are being turned down
by a studio might my reactions like

666
00:35:16,359 --> 00:35:19,729
it works

667
00:35:19,729 --> 00:35:22,099
and and and i'm an actor

668
00:35:22,099 --> 00:35:24,789
any questions that anybody would say i i
think that you wanted

669
00:35:24,789 --> 00:35:26,599
one last thing

670
00:35:26,599 --> 00:35:29,799
grateful to you live in it and i don't
quite know who

671
00:35:29,799 --> 00:35:35,379
relief but it's in terms of

672
00:35:35,379 --> 00:35:38,689
onto when you're talking about their
responsibilities as happens in talking

673
00:35:38,689 --> 00:35:40,589
to the media

674
00:35:40,589 --> 00:35:42,799
if you're not very careful

675
00:35:42,799 --> 00:35:47,089
what was you'll be paved over by the
information superhighway

676
00:35:47,089 --> 00:35:50,449
and i think that's quite true that uh...
as people finding a way to make money

677
00:35:50,449 --> 00:35:51,559
out of the internet

678
00:35:51,559 --> 00:35:54,779
and and people trying to bring you the
whole home shopping in everything

679
00:35:54,779 --> 00:35:56,209
there is a

680
00:35:56,209 --> 00:35:58,098
with they perceive as in cancer

681
00:35:58,099 --> 00:36:01,179
and packers are that cancer

682
00:36:01,179 --> 00:36:02,749
unless you find a way

683
00:36:02,749 --> 00:36:06,629
to present yourselves intake down as far
as your responsibility to people that

684
00:36:06,629 --> 00:36:09,328
so you really should be political but
you should be aware

685
00:36:09,329 --> 00:36:14,859
when your problems

686
00:36:14,859 --> 00:36:21,859
because let's face it this circus that
corporate america is not pregnant

687
00:36:28,229 --> 00:36:29,309
i don't have much

688
00:36:29,309 --> 00:36:31,289
mechanics of that

689
00:36:31,289 --> 00:36:34,019
when i need

690
00:36:34,019 --> 00:36:36,890
became aware of this world was

691
00:36:36,890 --> 00:36:38,759
twenty-some years ago

692
00:36:38,759 --> 00:36:41,849
grip of the global network projects

693
00:36:41,849 --> 00:36:44,319
you know the answer yes

694
00:36:44,319 --> 00:36:46,339
sixty

695
00:36:46,339 --> 00:36:48,169
edskitty

696
00:36:48,169 --> 00:36:53,479
information corporations were structured

697
00:36:53,479 --> 00:36:55,819
basically before monopoly

698
00:36:55,819 --> 00:36:58,169
capitalization

699
00:36:58,169 --> 00:36:59,270
and

mammal religion

701
00:37:02,759 --> 00:37:06,469
which for about a subversive as i could
be in that period

702
00:37:06,469 --> 00:37:07,469
um...

703
00:37:07,469 --> 00:37:09,599
no

704
00:37:09,599 --> 00:37:12,159
for unique about this

705
00:37:12,159 --> 00:37:16,459
activity any information world and
facility that

706
00:37:16,459 --> 00:37:18,049

707
00:37:18,049 --> 00:37:20,209
is called hackers has

708
00:37:20,209 --> 00:37:23,419
but frankly the whole younger generation
which is about to leave computer

709
00:37:23,419 --> 00:37:25,618
technology we you know

710
00:37:25,619 --> 00:37:27,949
any of their

711
00:37:27,949 --> 00:37:30,069
their seniors

712
00:37:30,069 --> 00:37:32,259
if their teachers or their parents

713
00:37:32,259 --> 00:37:33,130
is that

714
00:37:33,130 --> 00:37:34,180
the

715
00:37:34,180 --> 00:37:40,019
context of society has become
information based approach to

716
00:37:40,019 --> 00:37:41,450
boiling

717
00:37:41,450 --> 00:37:43,889
gold whatever also

718
00:37:43,889 --> 00:37:44,780
finally

719
00:37:44,780 --> 00:37:47,389
you vote for the potential for

720
00:37:47,389 --> 00:37:49,920
a new frontier

721
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:53,660
which in the american spirit of
storytelling and the great american ms

722
00:37:53,660 --> 00:37:55,618
has always been

723
00:37:55,619 --> 00:37:57,710
com about

724
00:37:57,710 --> 00:38:00,719
some guy going out there on the front
here

725
00:38:00,719 --> 00:38:04,940
and what's happening here when i've been
watching the last day or so it is

726
00:38:04,940 --> 00:38:09,389
kissing them spirit of the missing
somewhat culturally celeste

727
00:38:09,389 --> 00:38:13,669
twenty years until things got quality
cells

728
00:38:13,669 --> 00:38:16,368
to get this you know

729
00:38:16,369 --> 00:38:21,459
i remember also seen two months ago and
at u_c_l_a_ at the

730
00:38:21,459 --> 00:38:23,739
highway conference

731
00:38:23,739 --> 00:38:24,790
where i'm sitting

732
00:38:24,790 --> 00:38:26,509
edison wandered inside

733
00:38:26,509 --> 00:38:29,920
and watched uh...

734
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:32,839
heads of the major companies flap about

735
00:38:32,839 --> 00:38:35,240
what a great thing this was a sin

736
00:38:35,240 --> 00:38:39,369
a little bit all be connected

737
00:38:39,369 --> 00:38:42,099
subverted

738
00:38:42,099 --> 00:38:44,269
and they didn't have a clue

739
00:38:44,269 --> 00:38:47,609
uh... and what's fun to see here's the
people who do i completely understand

740
00:38:47,609 --> 00:38:49,209
that you use it

741
00:38:49,209 --> 00:38:52,339
the same has been raised which is about
to listen to which is our responsibility

742
00:38:52,339 --> 00:38:54,828
that's responsibility for buddy

00:38:54,829 --> 00:38:57,630
posted relist makes films www

744
00:38:57,630 --> 00:39:01,989
create any kind of cultural activity is
to have some sensible

745
00:39:01,989 --> 00:39:07,059
um... their own responsibility everybody
there is a wrong way to people

746
00:39:07,059 --> 00:39:11,939
the problem is that some people want to
carry more of their own way

747
00:39:11,939 --> 00:39:15,729
their people just are

748
00:39:15,729 --> 00:39:17,410
irresponsible

749
00:39:17,410 --> 00:39:18,949
we're trying to be

750
00:39:18,949 --> 00:39:20,450
hairpin where or what

751
00:39:20,450 --> 00:39:22,989
what's going down rolls on

752
00:39:22,989 --> 00:39:27,899
chronic movie that's uh... reveal upon
those

753
00:39:27,899 --> 00:39:31,388
we think we could do it

754
00:39:31,389 --> 00:39:38,389
both

755
00:39:53,159 --> 00:40:00,159

you'll find

766
00:41:27,550 --> 00:41:28,710
the occasional

words resume does new building

768
00:41:33,559 --> 00:41:37,639
i gotta go back to the point of view
earlier

769
00:41:37,639 --> 00:41:39,839
you guys are the problem

770
00:41:39,839 --> 00:41:42,379
and at least

771
00:41:42,379 --> 00:41:43,799
alone here

772
00:41:43,799 --> 00:41:49,170
i don't believe you are the problem i
think you're part of this

773
00:41:49,170 --> 00:41:52,069
you've offered an awareness offer

774
00:41:52,069 --> 00:41:57,369
what the capabilities all our why
revealed

775
00:41:57,369 --> 00:41:59,890
you guys are about technology abuse

776
00:41:59,890 --> 00:42:01,538
used extension

777
00:42:01,539 --> 00:42:02,950
how do i use it and five

778
00:42:02,950 --> 00:42:05,609
large activities

779
00:42:05,609 --> 00:42:07,109
super malicious

780
00:42:07,109 --> 00:42:12,089
you don't by and large have these
grandiose political financial economic

781
00:42:12,089 --> 00:42:17,179
or ka environmental agenda leader to be
like the technology works we can want to

782
00:42:17,179 --> 00:42:20,509
have some fun with it and occasionally
something you get it cracking at the

783
00:42:20,509 --> 00:42:21,310
okay

784
00:42:21,310 --> 00:42:24,970
may not be right but that is not the
fundamental problem before for america

785
00:42:24,970 --> 00:42:26,259
faces and

786
00:42:26,259 --> 00:42:31,150
they find it very easy and convenient to
blame something that is very little

787
00:42:31,150 --> 00:42:32,109
fibroblast

788
00:42:32,109 --> 00:42:33,828
next you guys

789
00:42:33,829 --> 00:42:35,119
so up

790
00:42:35,119 --> 00:42:36,719
the serb people there but

791
00:42:36,719 --> 00:42:38,560
the awareness is increasing

792
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:41,409
and i think that we're gonna see the
change occurred

793
00:42:41,409 --> 00:42:42,759
through the legal system pond

794
00:42:42,759 --> 00:42:47,429
fortunately because the lawyers in the
corporations are beginning to realize

795
00:42:47,429 --> 00:42:51,249
in an information asset intensive world

796
00:42:51,249 --> 00:42:55,630
they have to get on the ship because
there's going to be some major fiduciary

797
00:42:55,630 --> 00:42:57,239
responsibilities

798
00:42:57,239 --> 00:43:00,400
whether it's you guys breaking into the
bad guys steal the money for the federal

799
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:02,359
reserve or whatever happens to be

800
00:43:02,359 --> 00:43:06,249
privacy issues corporate espionage real
issues are going on out there that

801
00:43:06,249 --> 00:43:07,819
you're so

802
00:43:07,819 --> 00:43:10,879
molded demonstrating

803
00:43:10,879 --> 00:43:13,989
the lawyers are going well for starters
starts losses the lawyers are part of

804
00:43:13,989 --> 00:43:16,700
the lawyers upon in order to be a good
thing or not

805
00:43:16,700 --> 00:43:18,009
underwhelmed

806
00:43:18,009 --> 00:43:20,799
i was given the lawyers that i don't
know what i think it's going to be

807
00:43:20,799 --> 00:43:22,020
happening anyway

808
00:43:22,020 --> 00:43:25,109
but it was a rift used is that something

809
00:43:25,109 --> 00:43:28,098
to a very briefly i mean i think that
it's so hard

810
00:43:28,099 --> 00:43:31,159
quite precariously poised to the women i
think that

811
00:43:31,159 --> 00:43:34,340
certainly uh... law enforcement agencies
and

812
00:43:34,340 --> 00:43:36,499
corporate america report

813
00:43:36,499 --> 00:43:38,419
you back over europe

814
00:43:38,419 --> 00:43:40,839
basically saying that packed music row

815
00:43:40,839 --> 00:43:42,288
and they're frightened of it

816
00:43:42,289 --> 00:43:44,579
and they seem to return to property

817
00:43:44,579 --> 00:43:47,739
and so they use the the forces of law
and order

818
00:43:47,739 --> 00:43:49,710
to protect property which they

819
00:43:49,710 --> 00:43:50,769
was done

820
00:43:50,769 --> 00:43:52,889
i think the issues of

821
00:43:52,889 --> 00:43:54,729
access and transfers

822
00:43:54,729 --> 00:43:57,519
freedom that was certainly very
important

823
00:43:57,519 --> 00:44:01,469
uh... that my country and and dot the
nineteenth century

824
00:44:01,469 --> 00:44:03,639
is going to be a she said she was there

825
00:44:03,639 --> 00:44:08,229
the industrial conglomerate so she took
all of the land that was probably a

826
00:44:08,229 --> 00:44:13,119
uh... man at and all the laws of the
u_k_ basically of uh... reporters to

827
00:44:13,119 --> 00:44:15,719
protect those interests i think that

828
00:44:15,719 --> 00:44:18,919
is the paris time i think that's why
it's important for

829
00:44:18,919 --> 00:44:20,470
uh... journalism

830
00:44:20,470 --> 00:44:23,089
people like ourselves too

831
00:44:23,089 --> 00:44:26,799
blowing your culture

832
00:44:26,799 --> 00:44:28,199
it is presented

833
00:44:28,199 --> 00:44:29,629
in a positive way

834
00:44:29,629 --> 00:44:32,130
because i think that is not the culture

835
00:44:32,130 --> 00:44:34,089
this criminal all legal

836
00:44:34,089 --> 00:44:35,519
straight with us

837
00:44:35,519 --> 00:44:40,289
uh... i think that it's just the first
discovered by people

838
00:44:40,289 --> 00:44:42,139
it would have prevented

839
00:44:42,139 --> 00:44:45,749
i believe uh... by large everybody

840
00:44:45,749 --> 00:44:48,880
with some degree of intelligence look
like use of the above

841
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:50,389
rockers and

842
00:44:50,389 --> 00:44:53,559
are basically hackers and i want to try
to prove this

843
00:44:53,559 --> 00:44:54,899
noted

844
00:44:54,899 --> 00:44:57,788
a lot of seminars and conferences for
corporations with him

845
00:44:57,789 --> 00:45:00,479
oracle

846
00:45:00,479 --> 00:45:01,390
and at one point

847
00:45:01,390 --> 00:45:05,038
i sat down computers but we're pretty

848
00:45:05,039 --> 00:45:07,389
and we'll have a coffee break or
something

849
00:45:07,389 --> 00:45:10,190
and i sat down with the could not see
the computer screen

850
00:45:10,190 --> 00:45:15,650
restore ladies and with dr

851
00:45:15,650 --> 00:45:19,660
holy shit just broke into the white
house computers

852
00:45:19,660 --> 00:45:23,908
breezy delivers unrivaled wasn't
inclined

853
00:45:23,909 --> 00:45:24,710
the all

854
00:45:24,710 --> 00:45:27,989
want to know it was the first time in
their mind

855
00:45:27,989 --> 00:45:29,629
but they realize

856
00:45:29,629 --> 00:45:33,609
that they have certain attacker essence
with them

857
00:45:33,609 --> 00:45:36,410
i couldn't help educate

858
00:45:36,410 --> 00:45:37,558
uh... yes fine

859
00:45:37,559 --> 00:45:39,649
add to that dot anne

860
00:45:39,649 --> 00:45:44,308
that is one thing that you can do and he
did his it is simple but it but it is

861
00:45:44,309 --> 00:45:48,349
one thing you can do so political
analyst is to give

862
00:45:48,349 --> 00:45:50,489
the site's taste

863
00:45:50,489 --> 00:45:52,549
because uh...

864
00:45:52,549 --> 00:45:54,049
anybody who's

865
00:45:54,049 --> 00:45:55,749
you know anybody

866
00:45:55,749 --> 00:45:58,869
to recognize the people of this once
they are

867
00:45:58,869 --> 00:46:03,679
put face-to-face with that sort of
changes the whole perspective

868
00:46:03,679 --> 00:46:06,890
again you have to be very careful about
the context in which you do that did not

869
00:46:06,890 --> 00:46:07,788
like

870
00:46:07,789 --> 00:46:08,999
you know have

871
00:46:08,999 --> 00:46:12,419
uh... current affair shooting you know
shoulder

872
00:46:12,419 --> 00:46:14,379
but you know if you can

873
00:46:14,379 --> 00:46:18,279
if you are you know in in the face of
the situation with somebody from the

874
00:46:18,279 --> 00:46:20,159
media if you can get

875
00:46:20,159 --> 00:46:21,569
you know it somehow

876
00:46:21,569 --> 00:46:23,709
you know it's a matter of just some

877
00:46:23,709 --> 00:46:25,899
surreptitiously getting m

878
00:46:25,899 --> 00:46:30,409
you know a password to access to my
something under so that they can you

879
00:46:30,409 --> 00:46:36,089
know see what it's like i'd understand
with the buzz is about

880
00:46:36,089 --> 00:46:39,089
you know i can be achieved by this

881
00:46:39,089 --> 00:46:42,038
but let's just for that to get a sense
of

882
00:46:42,039 --> 00:46:44,879
but it's all about

883
00:46:44,879 --> 00:46:48,200
even if he does i think

884
00:46:48,200 --> 00:46:55,200
up in the corporate

885
00:47:08,559 --> 00:47:15,559
six

886
00:47:43,789 --> 00:47:46,079
haha

887
00:47:46,079 --> 00:47:47,489
different scene

888
00:47:47,489 --> 00:47:49,400
meetings dot kind of momentum

889
00:47:49,400 --> 00:47:52,299
using laser copies of this

890
00:47:52,299 --> 00:47:54,079
doing later copies

891
00:47:54,079 --> 00:48:00,809
burger youngbleaux countertop

892
00:48:00,809 --> 00:48:02,809
hardware ran back and didn't get

893
00:48:02,809 --> 00:48:05,269
they came back and

894
00:48:05,269 --> 00:48:06,370
meaning principle

895
00:48:06,370 --> 00:48:08,489
you happens again

896
00:48:08,489 --> 00:48:10,719
and his friends and we think that you
were not

897
00:48:10,719 --> 00:48:15,209
vivero packing but did not plugged into
the behavior here right now

898
00:48:15,209 --> 00:48:16,259
i'm pretty good good

899
00:48:16,259 --> 00:48:19,709
technology consultants

900
00:48:19,709 --> 00:48:22,739
if you look at steve might be one of the
things he talked on the book is alan

901
00:48:22,739 --> 00:48:24,829
greenspan elitist

902
00:48:24,829 --> 00:48:26,219
you know monks

903
00:48:26,219 --> 00:48:29,389
running on the tablet and a big party

904
00:48:29,389 --> 00:48:33,859
also leading to the string on

905
00:48:33,859 --> 00:48:36,348
vastly different and i could see

906
00:48:36,349 --> 00:48:39,089
generationally in terms of how young

907
00:48:39,089 --> 00:48:41,739
hackers are now out there were a lot of
people out there

908
00:48:41,739 --> 00:48:44,969
consider themselves actors were not

909
00:48:44,969 --> 00:48:46,509
any political movement were

910
00:48:46,509 --> 00:48:49,910
from the convention three repentance but
they're doing

911
00:48:49,910 --> 00:48:52,779
i wanted to make it simple answer user

912
00:48:52,779 --> 00:48:55,619
and spring up more and more

913
00:48:55,619 --> 00:48:58,669
passengers to preside

914
00:48:58,669 --> 00:49:03,419
i'm too old to speak about being young
in the eighties

915
00:49:03,419 --> 00:49:08,019
record step back to me twenty five years
and make a very simple statement

916
00:49:08,019 --> 00:49:09,859
that my generation

917
00:49:09,859 --> 00:49:13,149
in those twenty years in the late
sixties early seventies

918
00:49:13,149 --> 00:49:20,149
at the technology that you guys had
never would have break in the eighties

919
00:49:24,739 --> 00:49:31,619
online

920
00:49:31,619 --> 00:49:34,239
one of the things that was a big
difference in we hear this next

921
00:49:34,239 --> 00:49:38,009
generation stuff i want to get into all
that

922
00:49:38,009 --> 00:49:43,009
began democratization process for a
differences are i think carries a little

923
00:49:43,009 --> 00:49:45,579
bit further than that and

924
00:49:45,579 --> 00:49:50,269
we're going to start now called cyber
civil disobedience

925
00:49:50,269 --> 00:49:51,659
and right

926
00:49:51,659 --> 00:49:56,769
believes that this current generation it
may be so apolitical that they really

927
00:49:56,769 --> 00:50:00,200
don't know that the manpower that they
have

928
00:50:00,200 --> 00:50:04,789
that to make political statements twenty
five years ago we had to amass five

929
00:50:04,789 --> 00:50:08,799
hundred thousand people on the streets
of washington and get gassed in order to

930
00:50:08,799 --> 00:50:10,759
make the headlines

931
00:50:10,759 --> 00:50:14,979
and the required massive amounts of
organization transportation and oh

932
00:50:14,979 --> 00:50:18,639
police members and everybody else to be
able to make a political statement

933
00:50:18,639 --> 00:50:25,099
that is no longer true today the
technology exists to be able to

934
00:50:25,099 --> 00:50:28,720
massive massive systemic shutdowns

935
00:50:28,720 --> 00:50:30,499
renewal

936
00:50:30,499 --> 00:50:34,779
gift on one by one of them on my last of
the lawyers may say no it's conspiracy

937
00:50:34,779 --> 00:50:36,700
or something else

938
00:50:36,700 --> 00:50:40,779
but the ability to have a large part
demonstrations in cyberspace that

939
00:50:40,779 --> 00:50:43,769
effectively or some other civil
disobedience

940
00:50:43,769 --> 00:50:47,799
is a political force that has not yet
taken hold and i don't know what the

941
00:50:47,799 --> 00:50:51,709
future government

942
00:50:51,709 --> 00:50:55,009
personal question of op arctic cracker

943
00:50:55,009 --> 00:50:58,219
in terms of uh... uh... what's changed

944
00:50:58,219 --> 00:50:59,109
you know it's lost

945
00:50:59,109 --> 00:51:02,299
twenty years ago

946
00:51:02,299 --> 00:51:04,489
the weight of the technology has changed

947
00:51:04,489 --> 00:51:06,419
maybe we need to a real way

948
00:51:06,419 --> 00:51:07,379
real change in the way

949
00:51:07,380 --> 00:51:11,129
people insisted impact

950
00:51:11,129 --> 00:51:14,989
twenty years ago because computers
tended not to be linked together

951
00:51:14,989 --> 00:51:17,569
the people that got interested in
computers for the people who are

952
00:51:17,569 --> 00:51:21,589
interested in getting inside machine
people who are basically

953
00:51:21,589 --> 00:51:23,839
you know centers people who would

954
00:51:23,839 --> 00:51:26,049
tech park artwork

955
00:51:26,049 --> 00:51:30,279
radio with the people who just want to
get inside she messed around

956
00:51:30,279 --> 00:51:33,960
now i think that the way people are
involves computers and people get

957
00:51:33,960 --> 00:51:37,009
involved computers tends to be more
through communication

958
00:51:37,009 --> 00:51:39,070
uh... outside power system without

959
00:51:39,070 --> 00:51:42,729
doorstep yesterday actually which i

960
00:51:42,729 --> 00:51:47,209
explain my fears but not quite sure
actually but uh... america line it's

961
00:51:47,209 --> 00:51:50,170
actually the most important

962
00:51:50,170 --> 00:51:54,829
thing out there in terms of in terms of
the next five years of of hacker

963
00:51:54,829 --> 00:51:56,109
that i am

964
00:51:56,109 --> 00:52:00,089
you've got a situation where there are

965
00:52:00,089 --> 00:52:05,979
cast and one that policy just because
because it gives it goes against a lot

966
00:52:05,979 --> 00:52:09,999
of what this process about which is that
you guys are qua smart and develop most

967
00:52:09,999 --> 00:52:11,689
people in america

968
00:52:11,689 --> 00:52:13,038
and

969
00:52:13,039 --> 00:52:17,859
you like that

970
00:52:17,859 --> 00:52:23,219
elastomeric online is giving access to
the concept of computers in the concept

971
00:52:23,219 --> 00:52:24,359
of communicating

972
00:52:24,359 --> 00:52:25,360
with computers

973
00:52:25,360 --> 00:52:26,879
to people who

974
00:52:26,879 --> 00:52:30,140
one year ago five years ago twenty years
ago

975
00:52:30,140 --> 00:52:32,019
had absolutely nothing to do with it

976
00:52:32,019 --> 00:52:33,569
and that is

977
00:52:33,569 --> 00:52:40,569
a kind of democratization

978
00:52:43,409 --> 00:52:46,279
hacking has has always

979
00:52:46,279 --> 00:52:48,469
i think that i think that there's always
been

980
00:52:48,469 --> 00:52:50,609
uh... in some ways

981
00:52:50,609 --> 00:52:54,159
connect more people who are willing to
pay the bill we're going to pay because

982
00:52:54,159 --> 00:52:55,559
a lot of people that

983
00:52:55,559 --> 00:52:58,770
you know in the denise computers acog

984
00:52:58,770 --> 00:52:59,770
or people who could

985
00:52:59,770 --> 00:53:00,880
before computers

986
00:53:00,880 --> 00:53:03,529
i think that as confused as you grow as

987
00:53:03,529 --> 00:53:05,389
online connections get cheaper

988
00:53:05,389 --> 00:53:07,919
you're going to have people who are

superhighway that we're reading for

1057
00:59:34,729 --> 00:59:36,650
worry a lot of protection

1058
00:59:36,650 --> 00:59:40,609
and whatever the group of privacy is
important to us from our standpoint

1059
00:59:40,609 --> 00:59:44,969
and we're not going totally blew me off
including question off his gates on x

1060
00:59:44,969 --> 00:59:46,869
businessman hell is this

1061
00:59:46,869 --> 00:59:50,579
because the question that i was
addressing was politically derailing to

1062
00:59:50,579 --> 00:59:53,549
his efforts to try to get something done

1063
00:59:53,549 --> 00:59:55,249
he had a piece of the puzzle

1064
00:59:55,249 --> 00:59:58,499
but he didn't have the whole thing over
the next three three-and-a-half years or

1065
00:59:58,499 --> 01:00:02,819
so as we tried to work with gore prior
to becoming vice president

1066
01:00:02,819 --> 01:00:03,989
and uh... it

1067
01:00:03,989 --> 01:00:07,939
we were blowing up totally his office
did not want to know about it and about

1068
01:00:07,939 --> 01:00:11,239
what was the same as part of a problem
with were facing

1069
01:00:11,239 --> 01:00:13,769
often up in government

1070
01:00:13,769 --> 01:00:18,259
the issues that we all care about are
very very fundamental they're very very

1071
01:00:18,259 --> 01:00:20,259
high global issues

1072
01:00:20,259 --> 01:00:21,259

1073
01:00:21,259 --> 01:00:25,699
they are built in to some sort of
solution base for us as a country as a

1074
01:00:25,699 --> 01:00:26,539
whole

1075
