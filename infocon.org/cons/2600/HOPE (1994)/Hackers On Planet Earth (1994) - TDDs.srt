1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:03,389
disable people in the country and

2
00:00:03,389 --> 00:00:07,170
it see they seem to be largely ignoring
probably

3
00:00:07,170 --> 00:00:10,660
no pun intended I guess there a silent
majority in in

4
00:00:10,660 --> 00:00:14,150
being so but anyway on so

5
00:00:14,150 --> 00:00:18,420
you may not occur to most people but to
we take talking on the phone

6
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:22,880
for granny big dick van with Allen we
talk and then

7
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:25,960
if you were unable to speak because %uh
the

8
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:29,119
you something on the vocal cords you
whenever I'm not an expert on medical

9
00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:32,439
reasons why people can't hear or speak
but a

10
00:00:32,439 --> 00:00:35,570
if you are unable to speak for some
reason or if you are unable to hear or

11
00:00:35,570 --> 00:00:36,130
if you are

12
00:00:36,130 --> 00:00:41,140
a deaf mute in could do neither on you
couldn't get how could you communicated

13
00:00:41,140 --> 00:00:43,640
with the family would be a very
difficult task obviously

14
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:47,510
on people who are hearing impaired
online liberating

15
00:00:47,510 --> 00:00:52,010
to on gather information from people
there talking to him but obviously on

16
00:00:52,010 --> 00:00:52,690
the phone

17
00:00:52,690 --> 00:00:57,610
until we have then really good picture
fans in a completely all the way in

18
00:00:57,610 --> 00:00:59,059
about 30 years for that to happen

19
00:00:59,059 --> 00:01:02,940
on in Negril deliberating over the over
the fence out and I don't expect that to

20
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:03,890
happen anytime

21
00:01:03,890 --> 00:01:07,580
next couple years at least so that
brings us to TD's

22
00:01:07,580 --> 00:01:13,700
yes he's getting old

23
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:19,050
done the done

24
00:01:19,050 --> 00:01:20,640
yeah

25
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:22,990
the beans

26
00:01:22,990 --> 00:01:25,679
you is yeppers dams

27
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:29,220
it doesn't get worse unions your YouTube
their legal

28
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:33,520
means yeppers new me lose my

29
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:34,740
dreams

30
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:36,720
around them be

31
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:39,510
do not done

32
00:01:39,510 --> 00:01:43,360
me and we'll see the union

33
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:47,060
so this is it this is a I'll up the
camera this is it

34
00:01:47,060 --> 00:01:50,660
this is a camera pointed at someone's
lips yen

35
00:01:50,660 --> 00:01:54,869
or or did he shortly universal sign
language which which you speak in

36
00:01:54,870 --> 00:01:58,390
him limited if the person is

37
00:01:58,390 --> 00:02:01,930
you smiling yes okay the would

38
00:02:01,930 --> 00:02:05,350
million is a woman who was living on the
other side

39
00:02:05,350 --> 00:02:08,520
you due mid looms on the lips

40
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:13,790
loans well i pictured below the picture
with the phone against the plant

41
00:02:13,790 --> 00:02:17,060
remains I need a whole facial expression
rain

42
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:20,080
less interesting I see there's new
developments in this field time in

43
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:23,650
India and the next witness fielded you a
little bit about it and since nobody

44
00:02:23,650 --> 00:02:25,050
else is talking about tonight on a

45
00:02:25,050 --> 00:02:28,460
I be take the opportunity to do it non

46
00:02:28,460 --> 00:02:31,740
there's a gentleman is explained their
people working on the other technologies

47
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:32,959
with with the

48
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:38,300
eliminating the need for rent typing
which TD's use in actually visually

49
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:41,959
be you'll do lip reading everything but
obviously we were playing a significant

50
00:02:41,959 --> 00:02:45,959
expense on on the the party the people

51
00:02:45,959 --> 00:02:49,069
very soon worms

52
00:02:49,069 --> 00:02:52,069
using mine you know

53
00:02:52,069 --> 00:02:56,170
much greens which is most existing
vaccinated

54
00:02:56,170 --> 00:02:59,920
much green Albert and gives information
on after that

55
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:03,599
after the end the target I I'd like to
have been anyway

56
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:06,629
getting on on the did mean subjected to
the most

57
00:03:06,629 --> 00:03:10,649
commonly no common method used for
hearing and speech impaired people to

58
00:03:10,650 --> 00:03:11,659
communicate with 10

59
00:03:11,659 --> 00:03:16,000
where these DVD's telecommunication
devices for the deaf and they involve

60
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,040
basically typing information just like
Greece typing on a computer keyboard

61
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:23,769
and those your appeal familiar with no
10's on know that

62
00:03:23,769 --> 00:03:28,079
now when you typed on your keyboard
these characters

63
00:03:28,079 --> 00:03:31,169
each an individual code usually it's
called an ASCII code

64
00:03:31,169 --> 00:03:35,419
in ASCII code you converted into d

65
00:03:35,419 --> 00:03:39,359
what could be referred to as musical
tangale in San very musical they changed

66
00:03:39,359 --> 00:03:39,879
very

67
00:03:39,879 --> 00:03:43,828
variable pitches and audio tens gets
into the thin line in there

68
00:03:43,829 --> 00:03:47,409
decoded at the other end in
reconstructed into the letters ABC

69
00:03:47,409 --> 00:03:48,099
industry

70
00:03:48,099 --> 00:03:53,280
G well learn telecommunication devices
for the deaf had been around a lot

71
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:54,090
longer

72
00:03:54,090 --> 00:03:57,970
then PCs and in fact and me earlier

73
00:03:57,970 --> 00:04:01,079
non telecommunication devices with F
we're simply

74
00:04:01,079 --> 00:04:05,259
mechanical teletype machines which had
been around since the beginning

75
00:04:05,259 --> 00:04:09,040
and the premiere in the twenty years or
so teletype machines keenan

76
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:13,009
non when the most popular in TD's back
in

77
00:04:13,009 --> 00:04:16,250
thirty years and was called AT&T a model
15

78
00:04:16,250 --> 00:04:20,668
make manufactured by a teletype
corporation Indian for those in

79
00:04:20,668 --> 00:04:23,198
those in the audience who might be ham
radio operators you're probably familiar

80
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:25,229
with that particular machine because it
was in

81
00:04:25,229 --> 00:04:28,930
on he was used by Western Union
frequently in in in

82
00:04:28,930 --> 00:04:32,180
when the upgraded to be models like the
mild 33 kill time machine

83
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:35,870
all these things hit the surplus market
nearby and I'll 15 teletype machine for

84
00:04:35,870 --> 00:04:39,800
next to nothing can use it as a computer
printer before a computer printers were

85
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:42,880
affordable when you had to build your
own PC for free by one in a storm

86
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:46,690
anyway on the most modern a

87
00:04:46,690 --> 00:04:50,740
TD's now are much more compact in the
old mechanical

88
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:55,060
nineteen eighties it passed mom the ones
the username really don't have any

89
00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:56,409
moving parts aside from

90
00:04:56,409 --> 00:04:59,639
the keys which is in the keyboard is
opposed to the old mechanical tell

91
00:04:59,639 --> 00:05:00,650
typewriters which

92
00:05:00,650 --> 00:05:03,740
literally weighed in 50 to 100 pounds
and had

93
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:07,330
100 years in letters in you played

94
00:05:07,330 --> 00:05:11,050
boiling in the word extremely noisy I
guess it would buy if you're against it

95
00:05:11,050 --> 00:05:15,210
and new word new machines are quite
compact type happen to bring

96
00:05:15,210 --> 00:05:19,000
my DVD with me manufactured by AT&T

97
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:23,070
this is the model 29-30 it still
currently manufactured the

98
00:05:23,070 --> 00:05:27,740
but again for the past three years I
think a I paid about $250 dollars for

99
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:29,460
this at an AT&T prime next door

100
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:33,560
on you can see that it looks like a
standard computer keyboard although it's

101
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:34,130
not a

102
00:05:34,130 --> 00:05:37,289
business culture keyboard like a lot of
us are used to typing on its

103
00:05:37,289 --> 00:05:40,680
it said for those with you have been
dealing with computers long it remember

104
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:41,260
the in

105
00:05:41,260 --> 00:05:44,409
get regional PC junior in the peanut non

106
00:05:44,409 --> 00:05:47,839
they had a flat chick lit a keys it has
that kinda keyboard

107
00:05:47,839 --> 00:05:51,099
and devoted ATT expressed a concern to
me that

108
00:05:51,099 --> 00:05:54,719
nom some some users in this particular
device

109
00:05:54,719 --> 00:05:58,440
founded found it difficult to type on I
don't at all but I guess in

110
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:01,960
some people who more didn't have a lot
of manual dexterity mike hasn't

111
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:03,539
difficulty typing this keyboard but

112
00:06:03,539 --> 00:06:06,699
there is a tactile feedback and a
there's a two-line

113
00:06:06,699 --> 00:06:11,020
liquid crystal display a 40 characters
prize you totally characters

114
00:06:11,020 --> 00:06:14,750
units automatically switch roles to the
next line non

115
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:18,500
the way it hatches to your telephone is
edited is acoustically coupled which

116
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:21,279
means it it is there's no electrical
connection with the phone line

117
00:06:21,279 --> 00:06:24,300
you need to plug in any cords or
anything and

118
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:28,779
the handset the telephone simply in
rests on the topic then

119
00:06:28,779 --> 00:06:32,430
but the device for those who view member
from the early days a PC Sen

120
00:06:32,430 --> 00:06:36,260
when millions were acoustically coupled
in you would stream along in

121
00:06:36,260 --> 00:06:39,539
110 or maybe even three hundred died non

122
00:06:39,539 --> 00:06:42,630
a you can remember hearing the the tens

123
00:06:42,630 --> 00:06:46,320
and waiting for the carrier in hanging
the phone up in handset well

124
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:50,810
it's still down with the ladies because
if you're a if you leave your house or

125
00:06:50,810 --> 00:06:52,740
something you have a portable TD

126
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:55,520
if you're going to pay for me for
instance in there's not a GD building in

127
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:57,570
the paper and there's no connection to
plug into

128
00:06:57,570 --> 00:07:01,130
but Every Phone anybody uses has
handcent

129
00:07:01,130 --> 00:07:04,500
the you can this is this a gold medal
regular phantom hands in any way you

130
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:04,919
could just

131
00:07:04,919 --> 00:07:09,599
plotted on here in a good p.m.
determines the type on the keyboard

132
00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:12,930
are the Dickey happen he were to convert
it determines

133
00:07:12,930 --> 00:07:16,810
which bill into the microphone up the
defend your pollen from

134
00:07:16,810 --> 00:07:20,419
and the change from the person on the
receiving end to the this

135
00:07:20,419 --> 00:07:24,609
message not or heard by the earpiece and
your family

136
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:29,089
drink translated by the computer in the
device into text you see in the screen

137
00:07:29,089 --> 00:07:33,589
you know what and getting back to work
did I mention about pavements

138
00:07:33,589 --> 00:07:38,610
be not too long ago I remember the exact
number years but I think to three or

139
00:07:38,610 --> 00:07:40,669
four years ago maybe no one was the ADA

140
00:07:40,669 --> 00:07:44,039
funny but again 1990

141
00:07:44,039 --> 00:07:48,149
okay on the American said war-making

142
00:07:48,149 --> 00:07:52,300
Americans with Disabilities Act McHale
I'm gonna go over a couple things that

143
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:53,200
do

144
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:57,289
some mandates some federal laws that
were passed that required

145
00:07:57,289 --> 00:08:00,860
that GTE be made available in public
places and

146
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:04,599
some the details on our not a quote in
here

147
00:08:04,599 --> 00:08:08,909
not it's the law if an interior public

00:08:35,419 --> 00:08:36,490
room

156
00:08:36,490 --> 00:08:41,269
possible recovery room were hospital
waiting room one public text telephone

157
00:08:41,269 --> 00:08:44,339
more GTD shall be provided at each
location

158
00:08:44,339 --> 00:08:47,579
and the churchyard issue here today July
26 1991

159
00:08:47,579 --> 00:08:52,480
dispensed in finally the last eight if
an interior public payphone is provided

160
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:55,610
in a transit facility at the train
station a bus station

161
00:08:55,610 --> 00:08:58,889
at least one interior public text
telephone shall be provided in the

162
00:08:58,889 --> 00:09:00,220
station

163
00:09:00,220 --> 00:09:03,430
anywhere four or more public payphones
serve a particular

164
00:09:03,430 --> 00:09:06,510
entrance to rail station in at least one
is

165
00:09:06,510 --> 00:09:11,829
in is an interior location at least one
public text till 10 shall be provided to

166
00:09:11,829 --> 00:09:13,200
serve entrance

167
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:17,300
so the bottom line is done federal llame

168
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:21,850
requires on %uh shopping malls train
stations hospitals

169
00:09:21,850 --> 00:09:25,010
to provide text telephones RTD's

170
00:09:25,010 --> 00:09:28,939
and whether or not they have
hearing-impaired people that do work

171
00:09:28,940 --> 00:09:31,769
there or visit there that just as the
Lady gonna be there

172
00:09:31,769 --> 00:09:36,100
just like in we intend to be in building
seven for wheelchair access num

173
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:39,269
Meneghini wheelchair people but you can
have the Rams their hands it's a good

174
00:09:39,269 --> 00:09:40,079
idea

175
00:09:40,079 --> 00:09:44,470
bun one of the people many people here
have noticed that the public

176
00:09:44,470 --> 00:09:48,360
GTE's but did if you notice said

177
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:52,970
what you'll notice often is a it is a
payphone or a sign near the payphone

178
00:09:52,970 --> 00:09:56,720
that looks like a telephone handset
happy to sign with a few

179
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:59,860
white squares underneath which had a
copy love to hear this addition

180
00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:01,450
international logo did

181
00:10:01,450 --> 00:10:05,019
symbolizes TD's in a basically looks
like a telephone handset with

182
00:10:05,019 --> 00:10:09,620
three rows and awake he's under its
urban a white on black logo

183
00:10:09,620 --> 00:10:13,769
and that its to symbolize the Ltd is
available this facility

184
00:10:13,769 --> 00:10:17,880
often I found in a hearing impairment
just find this interesting

185
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:22,250
up of a knife and did whoever manages
whenever facility is whether to

186
00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:26,320
shopping mall owner hotel whatever they
don't have that he teased out they did

187
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:27,620
have a sign saying

188
00:10:27,620 --> 00:10:30,970
if you need one of these come to this
flooring see someone and measure whether

189
00:10:30,970 --> 00:10:33,940
they complied with all are not but it
seems to be the norm the

190
00:10:33,940 --> 00:10:37,029
and they are really out in the open in
most cases one

191
00:10:37,029 --> 00:10:41,589
yet had a question yeah I'm company I'm
gonna touch on it yet

192
00:10:41,589 --> 00:10:45,250
on he'd mentioned as something I did you
bring up on

193
00:10:45,250 --> 00:10:49,320
did in some facilities where it may not
be immediately obvious that there's a GD

194
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:50,199
available

195
00:10:50,199 --> 00:10:53,380
on you might notice that sum up a tent
Heather

196
00:10:53,380 --> 00:10:58,889
an extra on middle shelving to the
bottom it may be a foot deep

197
00:10:58,889 --> 00:11:02,500
or maybe ten inches deep underneath in
is a red light and from it

198
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:06,790
and that near me not usually will have a
sign about it saying

199
00:11:06,790 --> 00:11:11,480
TD telephoned you can use is a regular
pay them but what happens is

200
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:15,940
if you pick up the phone and I'll a
number it reaches a GD

201
00:11:15,940 --> 00:11:20,490
the pain the pavement will be checked
that term rationally TDM underneath it

202
00:11:20,490 --> 00:11:24,990
that Finn with detected in automatically
slide out on a motorized rumors and most

203
00:11:24,990 --> 00:11:26,800
people don't even notice these DVD's

204
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:29,810
because they're hidden underneath the
pavement and

205
00:11:29,810 --> 00:11:33,050
if you ever wanna c1e 3 yourself a good
way to do that is to

206
00:11:33,050 --> 00:11:37,180
work at 12 these public text telephones
saying there's no one who's your

207
00:11:37,180 --> 00:11:40,300
during a speech in here waiting to use
it on

208
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:44,420
and dial this number email me take this
number down it said

209
00:11:44,420 --> 00:11:47,680
800 be 55

210
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:50,700
in 11 55

211
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:54,089
that is a national on AT&T

212
00:11:54,089 --> 00:11:58,380
operator services number four hearing
and speech impaired people who are using

213
00:11:58,380 --> 00:11:59,400
TD's

214
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:02,900
if you call that number you'll hear he a
term

215
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:06,600
mom the kinda sounds like a modem 10
although

216
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:09,900
bien you can very clearly here

217
00:12:09,900 --> 00:12:13,720
a a ship between two different pitches
high and low pitch

218
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:17,100
send very very slow compared in the end

219
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:20,060
the militant entries to hear me
specially at fourteen at four which is

220
00:12:20,060 --> 00:12:20,880
just like a

221
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:25,240
a buzz yeah you can say some things

222
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:29,880
yeah I'm gonna beat me touching on as
well yes the year that did

223
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:33,220
the National number for ATG operator
services

224
00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:37,010
for GTD users is one eight hundred eat
55

225
00:12:37,010 --> 00:12:41,010
1159 everyone in this room can try
discount

226
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:44,680
by going to %uh a facility where there's
a public pay telephone

227
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:48,600
up South Street Seaport Penn Station

228
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:52,630
understand very people have answering
plate is there they're wearing

229
00:12:52,630 --> 00:12:55,860
on maybe this hotel I don't know but
name I would

230
00:12:55,860 --> 00:12:58,870
I would think that may be required at
Headingley probably had an engine they

231
00:12:58,870 --> 00:13:01,089
had to pull out a shelf or whatever they
do

232
00:13:01,089 --> 00:13:04,700
but in any case %uh if you call that
number you hear it and then if you're in

233
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:07,529
a public pay telephone and it has a TD
catch to it

234
00:13:07,529 --> 00:13:11,100
now in most cases it's it similar to
write or they will slide out and you'll

235
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:12,279
see something like this

236
00:13:12,279 --> 00:13:16,110
facing usually the cleaning stainless
steel unit down which is

237
00:13:16,110 --> 00:13:20,110
looks like it's a indestructible when
you're done making the call it XD tend

238
00:13:20,110 --> 00:13:20,980
to stop any

239
00:13:20,980 --> 00:13:24,310
slide back in but if you have a home

240
00:13:24,310 --> 00:13:28,040
telefony you obviously don't have to
wait for anything that slide out because

241
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:29,819
you you had this device in here in

242
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:33,829
I'd mention it but this particular unit
balled up just like a n

243
00:13:33,829 --> 00:13:37,180
that the size VHS videocassette you
recharges

244
00:13:37,180 --> 00:13:43,700
I guess you can get about mmm two or
three hours of continuous use any

245
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:44,060
minutes

246
00:13:44,060 --> 00:13:47,660
it's kinda battery 100 he's gonna try to
pitch frequently

247
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:50,930
bomb I wanted to touch on a

248
00:13:50,930 --> 00:13:54,940
the fact that you can if you don't have
access to any

249
00:13:54,940 --> 00:13:59,160
a regular GTE that you can you can
access some of the services now

250
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:03,010
with the regular computer modem I'm not
all services

251
00:14:03,010 --> 00:14:06,579
they are provided tttt users are
accessible by

252
00:14:06,579 --> 00:14:11,040
not by regular modem and the reason for
that is TD's traditionally have used a

253
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:11,490
need

254
00:14:11,490 --> 00:14:16,300
not telecommunications who'd we're most
familiar with help me he's called

255
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:20,120
called kill me she told me she killed
her called ASCII an american Standard

256
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:21,959
Code for interment Information
Interchange

257
00:14:21,959 --> 00:14:25,380
well this is the worst that was
developed I believe

258
00:14:25,380 --> 00:14:29,350
in the late sixties and early seventies
prior to that done

259
00:14:29,350 --> 00:14:33,690
there other co DEP said it but my dad
the main

260
00:14:33,690 --> 00:14:37,930
telecommunications code for sending text
with something called Blondell

261
00:14:37,930 --> 00:14:42,070
and it's a named after French researcher
the

262
00:14:42,070 --> 00:14:45,829
a lot of people dispute that he is this
guy written will

263
00:14:45,829 --> 00:14:48,839
called the Marie Curie the bottom line
is it's a

264
00:14:48,839 --> 00:14:52,570
it a5 maker is opposed to ask you which
is a7 be candid

265
00:14:52,570 --> 00:14:56,140
and %uh it only supports uppercase

266
00:14:56,140 --> 00:14:59,410
your Jones

267
00:14:59,410 --> 00:15:01,529
is actually here Jan

268
00:15:01,529 --> 00:15:04,470
alleged that's true that'd it

269
00:15:04,470 --> 00:15:07,740
it issued oh it's a shooter a to pseudo
on

270
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:11,440
upper and lower case characters that is
a a notice to correct it here

271
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:15,040
on it's a throwback from the days when
these were mechanical machines

272
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:19,540
on with the way they got around he not
having his upper case is

273
00:15:19,540 --> 00:15:22,870
they would have won code it would tell
the machine

274
00:15:22,870 --> 00:15:26,320
temple teletype machine to shift on

275
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:29,950
a budget this and you said you seen that
would rival or said

276
00:15:29,950 --> 00:15:33,550
the character so if you got occurred to
say

277
00:15:33,550 --> 00:15:36,529
go uppercase then everything from then
on the upper case we know they got

278
00:15:36,529 --> 00:15:37,970
another code to be all lower-case

279
00:15:37,970 --> 00:15:41,630
but generally speaking mostly users
didn't bother with the

280
00:15:41,630 --> 00:15:45,180
with the upper lower cases you the
machine in supporter whenever but

281
00:15:45,180 --> 00:15:48,260
the bottom line isn't and ASCII

282
00:15:48,260 --> 00:15:52,630
is not compatible still with some TD's
because it's a seven because

283
00:15:52,630 --> 00:15:56,660
good in the data rates are different on
nationally with then

284
00:15:56,660 --> 00:16:01,260
and won't make a deal with bill 103 East
and you just 300 blind

285
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:06,279
virulent NY's bit managed to achieve
which is 12 ani: bodin

286
00:16:06,279 --> 00:16:11,060
the although the whole slew the dow
whenever not protocols which were 2400

287
00:16:11,060 --> 00:16:11,730
bodin

288
00:16:11,730 --> 00:16:15,690
you were up to 14 foreign me at 34 now
they're all incompatible with

289
00:16:15,690 --> 00:16:19,260
with some the older GATT's and on

290
00:16:19,260 --> 00:16:23,149
you were finding more more services now
accept both

291
00:16:23,149 --> 00:16:28,250
an ASCII now and and body okay this
particular

292
00:16:28,250 --> 00:16:31,640
the machine supports both 300 by Danske

293
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:35,100
and my Dell in the butt and abide rate
by the way and I don't

294
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:38,450
is forty five and a half mile if that
sounds really slow

295
00:16:38,450 --> 00:16:42,420
it is but it still ABI not much

296
00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:47,040
slower than an average person can read
am it doesn't it's not cheap under a

297
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:50,070
semi somebody's typing is because they
can a 45-minute by

298
00:16:50,070 --> 00:16:53,170
it doesn't seem like you're me tapping
fingers but

299
00:16:53,170 --> 00:16:58,209
it's certainly not what we use to $49.4
million to the screen filling up almost

300
00:16:58,209 --> 00:17:01,279
instantaneously me know what you mean
FN's anyway so it doesn't really think

301
00:17:01,279 --> 00:17:02,480
people who were

302
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:06,459
using its just for casual conversation
in

303
00:17:06,459 --> 00:17:09,939

374
00:21:09,750 --> 00:21:13,720
done a communication software in local
mode where

375

00:24:16,290 --> 00:24:20,389
then you have to seek this stuff down
yen I can decide to download acres and

424
00:24:20,390 --> 00:24:21,720
is interested maybe

425
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:25,240
possible for communications but dead as
says

426
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:28,600
the people in the audience and you if
you if you hung around make some phone

427
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:29,559
calls in

428
00:24:29,559 --> 00:24:34,210
and be contacted in a school for the
hearing impaired her speech impaired and

429
00:24:34,210 --> 00:24:35,040
blind to

430
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:38,820
and whenever you might really get some
leads us to where you can find in a

431
00:24:38,820 --> 00:24:39,970
reason price device

432
00:24:39,970 --> 00:24:43,520
may be there the item I sure but there
may be a market for these

433
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:46,830
for use devices as well I don't know
people with I would assume that one

434
00:24:46,830 --> 00:24:47,610
upgrade

435
00:24:47,610 --> 00:24:51,290
nom from one mild another just like
people upgrade computers only

436
00:24:51,290 --> 00:24:54,980
but there have to do is really is that
we in the computer area have to

437
00:24:54,980 --> 00:24:59,170
on I did mention that somebody services
can be accessed by and by

438
00:24:59,170 --> 00:25:02,360
a normal computer an open to give you
the technical details

439
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:06,480
and how to do that you gonna need a
standard PC communications package

440
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:10,260
with a modem that communicates and at
least and

441
00:25:10,260 --> 00:25:15,150
300 behind I Donnelly the money and I
know

442
00:25:15,150 --> 00:25:18,690
hmmm I did mostly services communicate

443
00:25:18,690 --> 00:25:21,320
when they commit when they are
compatible with Angie communicated

444
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:22,050
either

445
00:25:22,050 --> 00:25:27,360
300 1200 2400 with I make fallback if
you need a 300 baud modem

446
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:30,380
on the in I

447
00:25:30,380 --> 00:25:33,610
the settings you want is a communication
software or aid

448
00:25:33,610 --> 00:25:37,080
data bits no parity

449
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:43,090
and one stunt bij a check engine the

450
00:25:43,090 --> 00:25:46,429
in me the submenu communication software

451
00:25:46,429 --> 00:25:49,710
to enable the flow control

452
00:25:49,710 --> 00:25:53,250
and you also want to choose enable

453
00:25:53,250 --> 00:25:57,920
the exponents of protocol all those
things are important

454
00:25:57,920 --> 00:26:01,809
if you don't have and aidid its new stop
it

455
00:26:01,809 --> 00:26:07,500
carried it emits no parity 1 stop it on
oh and it has to be having duplex in for

456
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:08,330
God and that

457
00:26:08,330 --> 00:26:11,970
it's very important must be half duplex
you have to use flow control

458
00:26:11,970 --> 00:26:15,250
you have to have your exon exon enabled

459
00:26:15,250 --> 00:26:20,310
then if you call for instance that 808
551 155 number

460
00:26:20,310 --> 00:26:24,560
with your computer his type if he hadn't
he's compatible million needed from them

461
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:28,649
from the N in the black medications be
my guess you could just take then

462
00:26:28,650 --> 00:26:31,920
a TD and TE if you have a 10

463
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:36,870
no damn I GTG 185 I woman 55

464
00:26:36,870 --> 00:26:41,080
and then after the modem dials you'll
you hear carrier tune in and you'll be

465
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:41,770
connected

466
00:26:41,770 --> 00:26:44,889
and the way that works it's kinda
interesting on

467
00:26:44,890 --> 00:26:49,780
you'll be connected with an operator who
has won the CD is generally there

468
00:26:49,780 --> 00:26:53,770
on I've just from communicating with
them doing well social engineering I

469
00:26:53,770 --> 00:26:54,250
found

470
00:26:54,250 --> 00:26:57,670
motor them are not disabled it just down

471
00:26:57,670 --> 00:27:02,340
making hearing in you can speak the dish
is just the job with AT&T year the

472
00:27:02,340 --> 00:27:04,000
library company have been work in

473
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:07,250
on what I find is really strange is

474
00:27:07,250 --> 00:27:12,280
dad the the operators you handle
directory assistance

475
00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:15,770
services like looking a telephone
numbers for you batt

476
00:27:15,770 --> 00:27:18,960
um aren't lead in any kinda computer
system

477
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:23,240
they have and I finest is sometimes you
to call you get

478
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:26,179
you get it I love it outside a
Philadelphian is a big central office

479
00:27:26,179 --> 00:27:28,040
near a live in Wayne Pennsylvania

480
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:33,110
and but there's a need a TD office near
where the band

481
00:27:33,110 --> 00:27:37,810
directory assistance services for the
hearing impaired I have taught you TT

482
00:27:37,810 --> 00:27:40,010
operators in washington

483
00:27:40,010 --> 00:27:43,919
in North Carolina in other areas he just
it's just

484
00:27:43,919 --> 00:27:47,480
be look at the dryer when you call that
number depending in

485
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:50,679
the traffic patterns at the
telecommunication system you get ready

486
00:27:50,679 --> 00:27:51,470
to wherever the

487
00:27:51,470 --> 00:27:54,740
they have people available but there
when I find earnings earnings a with

488
00:27:54,740 --> 00:27:55,800
time running his

489
00:27:55,800 --> 00:28:00,120
on AT&T bills itself as you know then

490
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:03,840
the company in the future and you will
experience this in and whenever in the

491
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:04,450
future

492
00:28:04,450 --> 00:28:07,690
yet they're still using and and

493
00:28:07,690 --> 00:28:11,470
manual telephone directories at the
siege

494
00:28:11,470 --> 00:28:15,570
at these offices Emanuel phone books for
the Rangers them on a shelf

495
00:28:15,570 --> 00:28:18,570
and another telephone which

496
00:28:18,570 --> 00:28:22,120
if they can find in the phone book what
they'll do is they'll say please hold on

497
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:25,200
tight they won't say it is the type in
please hold while we look at your number

498
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:28,600
and you hold when they pick up another
phone

499
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:32,050
incall a regular voice Directory
Assistance Operator

500
00:28:32,050 --> 00:28:35,300
and alas that information over them

501
00:28:35,300 --> 00:28:39,280
and then type that in in the whole
process takes a good minute

502
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:43,629
which is I find it almost excruciatingly
slow

503
00:28:43,630 --> 00:28:47,600
on is now I can you call regulations
just get rescissions operating his type

504
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:50,020
he struck he started the back nine
usually in

505
00:28:50,020 --> 00:28:53,629
and any to connect with an automated way
to tell you the number well

506
00:28:53,630 --> 00:28:58,550
PD users unfortunately had to suffer
through this awkward painfully

507
00:28:58,550 --> 00:29:01,668
slow in technologically non

508
00:29:01,669 --> 00:29:05,810
and anachronistic the method where

509
00:29:05,810 --> 00:29:08,820
they don't have on-line computers
international the operators

510
00:29:08,820 --> 00:29:13,200
why don't you have some sort of online
system work you know you had the ttttt

511
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:16,560
integrated with a directory assistance
terminal like to regulatory agencies

512
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:17,750
Japanese it

513
00:29:17,750 --> 00:29:21,220
now we don't know the justices our job
in whenever I found

514
00:29:21,220 --> 00:29:25,669
furman from a hacker stamp on a hacker
that the TD operator

515
00:29:25,669 --> 00:29:29,970
are often much more on %uh

516
00:29:29,970 --> 00:29:33,520
6f to build a social engineering then a
regular operating because

517
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:36,590
they have really boring jobs evidently
they don't get a lot in they don't get a

518
00:29:36,590 --> 00:29:37,890
lot of calls

519
00:29:37,890 --> 00:29:40,730
so what you can have some pretty
interesting conversations with the

520
00:29:40,730 --> 00:29:43,140
city's average despite having a TD

521
00:29:43,140 --> 00:29:46,490
and what are the other advantages I
found two weren't using ATT

522
00:29:46,490 --> 00:29:49,730
is that said it's a toll free number
when you call

523
00:29:49,730 --> 00:29:53,360
on directory assistance view this as
opposed to

524
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:56,950
Delhi won the area code and number um

525
00:29:56,950 --> 00:30:00,610
we have to pay 75 cents now yes recently
than last year

526
00:30:00,610 --> 00:30:04,520
on they said over in protest after this
week these people shouldn't be getting

527
00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:04,860
free

528
00:30:04,860 --> 00:30:08,760
ATT decide if they should be getting
free n jettison services

529
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:12,440
sell at they put in a handy and any an
iron

530
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:16,080
NEC type system whereby they knew who
was calling

531
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:19,240
any wrote something down whenever the

532
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:22,720
like two months later you get this bill
in the mail attended this addendums your

533
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:24,419
phone bill like the back and a half

534
00:30:24,419 --> 00:30:27,860
now from all the lies that I read
they're not legally allowed to charge

535
00:30:27,860 --> 00:30:28,500
you

536
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:32,070
more than the going rate for graduation
services yet

537
00:30:32,070 --> 00:30:35,178
the times I've done it be tried in like
a dollar in hand I'm always call them

538
00:30:35,179 --> 00:30:35,990
and then

539
00:30:35,990 --> 00:30:39,919
complained in something I'm times have
been had asked her she providers are

540
00:30:39,919 --> 00:30:41,810
going to take it off my bill ni had

541
00:30:41,810 --> 00:30:44,960
so I found a way around that n only
reason I'm saying is it because they're

542
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:48,600
B&D been jerks about this so what I've
done is

543
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:51,740
you can eliminate having to deal with
the automatic

544
00:30:51,740 --> 00:30:56,250
identification %uh giving your phone
number up in every holly hunter number

545
00:30:56,250 --> 00:30:58,940
for Jimmy don't know whenever you call a
toll-free number

546
00:30:58,940 --> 00:31:01,980
pretty appalling will know your phone
number you know they'll know immediately

547
00:31:01,980 --> 00:31:03,390
if they have the right equipment

548
00:31:03,390 --> 00:31:06,580
will know within a month when they get
there there what's bill so

549
00:31:06,580 --> 00:31:10,658
be aware that the privacy standpoint
budget one way around on

550
00:31:10,659 --> 00:31:14,300
one way around the this exorbitant fee
that AT&T is trading is he just dial

551
00:31:14,300 --> 00:31:15,900
zero until the operating

552
00:31:15,900 --> 00:31:19,550
operator have been trying to Dallas toll
free number and I can't seem to get it

553
00:31:19,550 --> 00:31:20,780
get any answer

554
00:31:20,780 --> 00:31:25,668
on can eat right for me to see what's
number and its 800 even if I 1155

555
00:31:25,669 --> 00:31:29,050
and I'll try and into your range say
Thank You operator and you hang your

556
00:31:29,050 --> 00:31:30,129
phone up in here in

557
00:31:30,130 --> 00:31:34,409
in they need you prices your call the
operator will that point

558
00:31:34,409 --> 00:31:37,650
ask you for on you

559
00:31:37,650 --> 00:31:41,610
if we want to work contact every the
number the persons name the person whose

560
00:31:41,610 --> 00:31:42,740
number you want

561
00:31:42,740 --> 00:31:46,659
YouTube channel name city in name and
city in central SQ regular season

562
00:31:46,659 --> 00:31:50,090
but then if you call to the operand
found they will let ask you

563
00:31:50,090 --> 00:31:54,030
what number you calling from so when I
have frequently don't just give them the

564
00:31:54,030 --> 00:31:54,928
number my local

565
00:31:54,929 --> 00:31:58,950
on AT&T office YouTube who evidently
gets the bill

566
00:31:58,950 --> 00:32:05,040
so that suggest desserts as far as I'm
concerned you're gonna add something

567
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:08,320
your own

568
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:13,019
the last week twice one

you can see I had the a the t-shirt x9x

576
00:32:41,330 --> 00:32:44,010
and a former nynex employees

577
00:32:44,010 --> 00:32:47,100
done

578
00:32:47,100 --> 00:32:49,860
yeah

579
00:32:49,860 --> 00:32:52,480
your own

580
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:57,580
on go figure well if if they re either
way I look at it as if they're gonna

581
00:32:57,580 --> 00:32:59,690
charge exorbitant fee then

582
00:32:59,690 --> 00:33:02,700
I'm gonna find a way around it and if
they charge a fair fee I would mind

583
00:33:02,700 --> 00:33:07,140
me you have a family to your home you
want to go at a payphone define ATT

584
00:33:07,140 --> 00:33:10,950
dances as to if you've got a long
distance directors as a group a found

585
00:33:10,950 --> 00:33:16,179
a normal value that way Sam with three
questions anybody had about 20

586
00:33:16,179 --> 00:33:19,760
one question I want to ask the audience
I know there are special number set up

587
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:20,410
for

588
00:33:20,410 --> 00:33:23,919
emergency services like the you hearing
people

589
00:33:23,919 --> 00:33:27,000
gene people can call 911 for that system

590
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:30,330
I know New York area there's another
number you can call

591
00:33:30,330 --> 00:33:34,419
I think the three digit number gonna 311
okay if you call 311

592
00:33:34,419 --> 00:33:37,679
from a cellular phone an order from a
Senate run from it

593
00:33:37,679 --> 00:33:40,790
for many found you'll get a TD operator
on

594
00:33:40,790 --> 00:33:44,629
the TD emergency operating sure they've
set up the system's and

595
00:33:44,630 --> 00:33:47,860
wright also found 9

596
00:33:47,860 --> 00:33:51,010
to Emanuel's he called me with this an
interesting tape recordings are some

597
00:33:51,010 --> 00:33:51,540
time

598
00:33:51,540 --> 00:33:56,590
fan messages in me what I said they send
ittt messages he played them over the

599
00:33:56,590 --> 00:33:57,390
phone to me

600
00:33:57,390 --> 00:34:00,700
night despite held the phone up to
tonight he dnt

601
00:34:00,700 --> 00:34:03,840
and we were able to decode messages
pretty interesting one last thing I want

602
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:04,419
to say is

603
00:34:04,419 --> 00:34:07,790
did with the way did that one advance to
the lower speed

604
00:34:07,790 --> 00:34:12,300
by Bill forty-five it had not being as
it does require carrier like

605
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:16,139
were used to using a I'm no dams you can
you can record

606
00:34:16,139 --> 00:34:19,740
and these TD messages on in answering
machine

607
00:34:19,740 --> 00:34:23,460
and so many can play them back in
decoding visit audio tones voicemail

608
00:34:23,460 --> 00:34:24,770
systems you could leave the

609
00:34:24,770 --> 00:34:29,239
messages for for people on a voicemail
system Batt's I've done in actually

610
00:34:29,240 --> 00:34:30,060
found it is sorta

611
00:34:30,060 --> 00:34:33,639
accrued but sir to the effective
security method

612
00:34:33,639 --> 00:34:36,669
up leaving leaving messages an average
person

613
00:34:36,668 --> 00:34:40,000
like leases know exactly what it is an
admitted he did he and wouldn't you know

614
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:40,550
I wouldn't

615
00:34:40,550 --> 00:34:44,139
say there's some real and away they
couldn't figure it out but on

616
00:34:44,139 --> 00:34:48,359
you can leave the message on voicemail
Ranger machine with ATT

617
00:34:48,359 --> 00:34:51,668
and the person who retrieved them can
get hold it GTE

618
00:34:51,668 --> 00:34:55,710
and up to the speaker each machine it
will decode and display on the unit so

619
00:34:55,710 --> 00:34:58,840
on that has ended and he couldn't do
that with it with computer type:

620
00:34:58,840 --> 00:35:03,290
on message has militancy night in if
they don't take a carrier to hang up

621
00:35:03,290 --> 00:35:03,800
really

622
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:07,170
Sam any questions about ATT's it might
be able to answer

623
00:35:07,170 --> 00:35:11,580
yung's

624
00:35:11,580 --> 00:35:15,420
oh yeah it's something now they kinda
full back on a little bit but to

625
00:35:15,420 --> 00:35:20,680
ya the folks might have earned the worst
damage in addition

626
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:24,368
okay on idiot for those are your 26
return to sender readers many you

627
00:35:24,369 --> 00:35:25,810
probably are you would be here

628
00:35:25,810 --> 00:35:32,029
on and you've probably seen these AT&T
or read about the AT&T 2000 founded the

629
00:35:32,030 --> 00:35:33,570
public you pay found

630
00:35:33,570 --> 00:35:38,119
the day looks very futuristic there's a
there's a color video display on in a

631
00:35:38,119 --> 00:35:39,480
keyboard in all this

632
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:43,020
well those things some are combination

633
00:35:43,020 --> 00:35:46,440
regular ASCII computer terminals and
TD's am

634
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:49,619
evidently there are some ruling a few
months ago

635
00:35:49,619 --> 00:35:52,770
that form forbade I ATT from

636
00:35:52,770 --> 00:35:57,109
from having the the ass keep are there
to work anymore

637
00:35:57,109 --> 00:36:01,259
as a regular telephone limit in didn't
go with certain tariffs or something

638
00:36:01,260 --> 00:36:05,330
but you can still use these is a std's
however I found

639
00:36:05,330 --> 00:36:09,859
the nail you on a charge every time you
can even you cannot call

640
00:36:09,859 --> 00:36:13,080
the you cannot call the toll-free
director his number

641
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:17,200
on 808 551 552 on

642
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:21,420
from Wendy's it won't work my baby email
you the operator comes on and says

643
00:36:21,420 --> 00:36:24,450
or that did then ten types you know

644
00:36:24,450 --> 00:36:28,890
please deposit the money or whatever
sanam

645
00:36:28,890 --> 00:36:33,540
I'm sorry so that I guess the answer I'm
sure the ass for credit card number

646
00:36:33,540 --> 00:36:37,259
rate she can even use a red box a happy
admin

647
00:36:37,260 --> 00:36:41,640
yet to give the card number hmm out yet
yes

648
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:46,049
the usual

649
00:36:46,050 --> 00:36:48,930
I'm dats I that's something I have I
have

650
00:36:48,930 --> 00:36:54,680
stated AT&T on me to call an 800 number
you should not be a charge get it it

651
00:36:54,680 --> 00:36:55,100
said

652
00:36:55,100 --> 00:36:58,779
toll free number i mean that's the whole
definition any numbers call the

653
00:36:58,780 --> 00:37:00,080
toll-free number yet

654
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:03,610
if you call 808 551 552 operator

655
00:37:03,610 --> 00:37:06,750
who types images back to you when you we
answered actresses information

656
00:37:06,750 --> 00:37:09,930
at no point anywhere says it is any
charge involved calling us 8

657
00:37:09,930 --> 00:37:13,690
this toll-free number and by too much
let you get this delayed

658
00:37:13,690 --> 00:37:18,000
but gonna have charge and every time a
disputed that's the rational I beauty

659
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:18,290
and

660
00:37:18,290 --> 00:37:22,350
you that I call the toll-free 800 number
and water discharge was never informed

661
00:37:22,350 --> 00:37:23,330
there is a charge

662
00:37:23,330 --> 00:37:27,279
now you'd heard there are some some lar
something you could not charge for

663
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:28,210
calling her number

664
00:37:28,210 --> 00:37:31,590
yett doing this to us in the

665
00:37:31,590 --> 00:37:34,910
we'll mother be hii

666
00:37:34,910 --> 00:37:37,920
were moon Miley lawn

667
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:43,280
your mood that day UK he didn't like
going home with the dog barking midnight

668
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:46,550
tude the be though

669
00:37:46,550 --> 00:37:50,730
we can you to clipper ship they don't
mine at you think the regionally

670
00:37:50,730 --> 00:37:55,020
yeah he is by the way we demonstrate
leadership tomorrow

671
00:37:55,020 --> 00:37:58,830
he even possibly yours is Justin's

672
00:37:58,830 --> 00:38:05,180
go home health care yeah I think we
probably all agree that no but no human

673
00:38:05,180 --> 00:38:07,009
being can go do it single day without

674
00:38:07,010 --> 00:38:11,010
that making some losses hung in her
written consent it's just a legislator

675
00:38:11,010 --> 00:38:16,720
year and something else yeah but you
have to rate only got it you

676
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:20,480
you got it you have to go through one or
two levels up I would enjoy it because

677
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:23,480
yeah I don't give up and they had they
can hang up on you

678
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:27,600
so I got him you know they're is our
talk with him for an hour to get it off

679
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:30,770
but they're not allowed to hang up on
you and if they do I

680
00:38:30,770 --> 00:38:34,490
before I before Ian as I initialize the
conversation I get their name

681
00:38:34,490 --> 00:38:37,810
so whenever you get somebody's new
special operators name first

682
00:38:37,810 --> 00:38:41,480
they will never be rude to your hand is
a No

683
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:45,160
you can call the supervising get them
fired or leasing a lot of trouble

684
00:38:45,160 --> 00:38:50,549
sold you read something years

685
00:38:50,550 --> 00:38:52,830
there

686
00:38:52,830 --> 00:38:55,770
didn't no unfortunately on

687
00:38:55,770 --> 00:38:59,040
there would be a good idea I wish
someone would come up with in sort of an

688
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:03,290
all all in one solution known he'd asked
whether you can use one of these things

689
00:39:03,290 --> 00:39:04,150
to send

690
00:39:04,150 --> 00:39:08,180
text message issued his new alphanumeric
pagers which I'm not unlike not lucky

691
00:39:08,180 --> 00:39:09,120
enough to have been

692
00:39:09,120 --> 00:39:12,810
by the display page just regular digital
sleep later know there is a device a

693
00:39:12,810 --> 00:39:13,590
company called

694
00:39:13,590 --> 00:39:17,860
at page entry PA GE a PA GE

695
00:39:17,860 --> 00:39:21,230
NGR why I believe a toll-free number to
call them they make a little calculator

696
00:39:21,230 --> 00:39:22,430
size device

697
00:39:22,430 --> 00:39:27,669
that can be used to send text messages
and faxes surprisingly can take message

698
00:39:27,670 --> 00:39:29,010
in all come at a fax machine

699
00:39:29,010 --> 00:39:32,080
or send messages to a I a text pager

700
00:39:32,080 --> 00:39:35,370
with now with the advent of digital
signal processing technology coming

701
00:39:35,370 --> 00:39:39,640
becoming mainstream somebody could
easily are now without too much

702
00:39:39,640 --> 00:39:41,930
difficulty something like ATT could
easily design

703
00:39:41,930 --> 00:39:45,529
a device that could send messages to
text pagers which would be valuable to

704
00:39:45,530 --> 00:39:47,140
hearing-impaired people who think

705
00:39:47,140 --> 00:39:50,460
and send by Delon & scheme education

706
00:39:50,460 --> 00:39:53,470
but they haven't come out much this is
really a I'll

707
00:39:53,470 --> 00:39:56,470
hugely profitable market since ron is
you would think

708
00:39:56,470 --> 00:39:59,730
you think big mouth establish twenty-two
million people but damn I need these

709
00:39:59,730 --> 00:40:00,250
things that

710
00:40:00,250 --> 00:40:04,440
they just don't come seem to come out
with the with things that people want

711
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:07,540
generally yeah be

712
00:40:07,540 --> 00:40:13,200
I'm sorry 1

713
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:17,610
bottom motto modems him

714
00:40:17,610 --> 00:40:22,270
by I'm I'm sorry and i cant usually seen
were zone there were some bottom modems

715
00:40:22,270 --> 00:40:26,360
listen about a million Leanne

716
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:30,280
oh yeah oh yeah before you know it's
true mom before Ashley caught on yet

717
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:33,720
yeah do it also did bottom yeah

718
00:40:33,720 --> 00:40:37,520
that was one of the best modems didn't
ever made I still think that

719
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:41,610
thank John Draper for that done

720
00:40:41,610 --> 00:40:45,950
a bad bono's just it is a way of saying
ASCII but it's referring to a different

721
00:40:45,950 --> 00:40:47,810
telecommunications code

722
00:40:47,810 --> 00:40:50,980
botella body was in a moment french guy
who

723
00:40:50,980 --> 00:40:54,450
still who came up with this code again
Schneider now but it's use a bodily

724
00:40:54,450 --> 00:40:55,410
referring to

725
00:40:55,410 --> 00:40:59,879
if I did telecommunications co di unlike
ask you which is 70 telecommunications

726
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:00,300
hey

727
00:41:00,300 --> 00:41:04,200
but if that does make sense you go to
library looking at his

728
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:11,200
they can explain it better than i can.
the book yeah

729
00:41:13,130 --> 00:41:16,540
he asked if you call from a payphone in
any give that number

730
00:41:16,540 --> 00:41:19,660
they say did they say they can build up
a pen I don't know I've never tried to

731
00:41:19,660 --> 00:41:22,870
get in the paper member I usually in the
number my local AT&T of its

732
00:41:22,870 --> 00:41:27,259
you're not a call to an opportunity 9

733
00:41:27,260 --> 00:41:31,400
demand yes

734
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:36,000
yeah that's a good question I have not
done that if you dial

735
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,780
a dish from a regular pay found with one
of these things that eight

736
00:41:38,780 --> 00:41:39,620
hundred-number

737
00:41:39,620 --> 00:41:44,140
on ostensibly on I don't know whether
they would ask you the number

738
00:41:44,140 --> 00:41:48,430
bombard your home or whether they were
just as early as bill that

739
00:41:48,430 --> 00:41:52,970
that PIF mm I don't know that's a good
question never tried it

740
00:41:52,970 --> 00:41:56,090
yeah well answer phone down

741
00:41:56,090 --> 00:42:01,270
yes mines

742
00:42:01,270 --> 00:42:05,470
young he tried a number union

743
00:42:05,470 --> 00:42:08,780
hun homes

744
00:42:08,780 --> 00:42:09,650
d

745
00:42:09,650 --> 00:42:10,420
down

746
00:42:10,420 --> 00:42:13,490
when I'm done

747
00:42:13,490 --> 00:42:16,710
brain larvae but

748
00:42:16,710 --> 00:42:18,559
me

749
00:42:18,559 --> 00:42:21,910
oh yeah I'm glad you touch on it yeah
there's there's there's were called

750
00:42:21,910 --> 00:42:25,558
human TTT protocols a little
abbreviations which on

751
00:42:25,559 --> 00:42:28,599
which make it easier for people say
message without having a whole word

752
00:42:28,599 --> 00:42:31,839
there he said he saw things I said GA on
the screen when he tried it

753
00:42:31,839 --> 00:42:35,680
GA meet is an abbreviation for go ahead
it means like I'm done taking his line

754
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:41,230
now you reply on heey becomes normal
only talk even hell intimated in a sense

755
00:42:41,230 --> 00:42:43,770
the waiver by the beach typing something
you type go ahead

756
00:42:43,770 --> 00:42:46,410
another there may be other little
niceties like that but one other I

757
00:42:46,410 --> 00:42:47,440
discovered he said

758
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:51,130
at the end of the communication on heey

759
00:42:51,130 --> 00:42:54,540
you type SK SK SK was any

760
00:42:54,540 --> 00:42:59,160
stocky okay snogging okay I T I thought
it would

761
00:42:59,160 --> 00:43:02,259
I didn't know what it meant but it but I
you that I just it is that

762
00:43:02,260 --> 00:43:05,630
invention why the rather %uh little
conventions used for typing that

763
00:43:05,630 --> 00:43:09,359
and money

764
00:43:09,359 --> 00:43:11,390
a learn

765
00:43:11,390 --> 00:43:15,080
okay sometimes you can't add it seemed
people will take a hit into the line 78

766
00:43:15,080 --> 00:43:16,350
a go-ahead

767
00:43:16,350 --> 00:43:21,620
yeah

768
00:43:21,620 --> 00:43:24,870
irate some CDs do not provide a quick
question mark character

769
00:43:24,870 --> 00:43:28,839
so wet me take you kill and I notice
some other directors just operators use

770
00:43:28,840 --> 00:43:33,170
the QC said a question marks and that's
it that's probably good

771
00:43:33,170 --> 00:43:36,550
great I guess they they use it
lowest-common-denominator

772
00:43:36,550 --> 00:43:40,940
that make sense I'm gonna had to leave
your game over I'm expanding our past my

773
00:43:40,940 --> 00:43:41,500
time but

774
00:43:41,500 --> 00:43:48,220
I'll take one more two more questions

775
00:43:48,220 --> 00:43:49,090

786
00:44:15,789 --> 00:44:19,510
on it like 45 in half by Badeaux

787
00:44:19,510 --> 00:44:22,829
