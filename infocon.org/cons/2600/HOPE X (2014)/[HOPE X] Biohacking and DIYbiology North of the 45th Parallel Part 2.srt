1
00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:03,790
and their their complaint was that's sir
it it works but

2
00:00:03,790 --> 00:00:06,720
you have to like keep an eye on and make
sure that it doesn't like mess up and

3
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:07,390
these things are

4
00:00:07,390 --> 00:00:10,710
designs that they feel in the ass to get
means every couple months and yet to pay

5
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:11,690
ten grand to get them

6
00:00:11,690 --> 00:00:15,759
has done answer the huge demand for like
you know things that just work and that

7
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:17,190
are easy to fix yourself kinda thing

8
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:22,230
anode love to see this thing just do
that I own one as well I'm in the

9
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:23,570
process of assembling at

10
00:00:23,570 --> 00:00:26,779
come on over to

11
00:00:26,779 --> 00:00:33,420
try and help me a but I'll definitely be
able to assemble this robot long before

12
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:37,000
I'm able to execute %uh a lab protocol

13
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:42,090
by hand myself %uh without significant
help from Kevin for example

14
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:45,770
I'm there's a there's other hardware
projects

15
00:00:45,770 --> 00:00:50,539
as well yet this is a bio printer I
which is basically an inkjet printer

16
00:00:50,539 --> 00:00:50,829
that

17
00:00:50,829 --> 00:00:54,129
was hacked to Prince I you know
biological media

18
00:00:54,129 --> 00:00:57,629
I was very yet you I am just

19
00:00:57,629 --> 00:01:02,039
bacterial cells and so this is from by a
curious which is a

20
00:01:02,039 --> 00:01:06,220
I'm you i buy was facing ten San
Francisco and

21
00:01:06,220 --> 00:01:10,720
this is really cool cuz I E recently
found another project at Duke University

22
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:12,270
in this is the cure the academic one

23
00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:16,570
I am and they were using a printer that
could print on the CDs

24
00:01:16,570 --> 00:01:19,570
so you base their place a CD with a go
you know

25
00:01:19,570 --> 00:01:23,009
petri dish and then you would be able to
Prince and yourself that way

26
00:01:23,009 --> 00:01:26,700
so and I was completely independent they
had no idea that this is this its allies

27
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:29,799
talk with them the right to cancel
amazing yeah

28
00:01:29,799 --> 00:01:33,150
I think you know one of the ultimate
goals a

29
00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:36,170
these ideas a bio printers om is

30
00:01:36,170 --> 00:01:39,880
not so so this was like a 2d printed
printed text

31
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:43,710
on an agar plate and anger is just food
for bacteria on but you know the

32
00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:45,490
ultimate goal of this kind of technology

33
00:01:45,490 --> 00:01:48,700
is to print 3d structures so for example
print

34
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:52,420
a liver print heart print the

35
00:01:52,420 --> 00:01:56,299
a leg bone or something like that home I
mean only people like Steve Jobs can get

36
00:01:56,299 --> 00:01:57,780
liver transplants in time

37
00:01:57,780 --> 00:02:01,149
to survive you know terrible diseases

38
00:02:01,149 --> 00:02:05,219
a man if we could bill

39
00:02:05,219 --> 00:02:08,819
livers and hearts for people that would
be fantastic your

40
00:02:08,819 --> 00:02:12,080
yes

41
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:15,900
years but those those aren't like a
organs like it like that like a liver

42
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:19,080
has to function but yeah exactly where
were we're working towards that and I

43
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:19,720
think that

44
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:23,200
and another cool thing with the printing
aspect is that you know you can just

45
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:24,620
print text like in this

46
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:28,260
this picture or you know if you had to
use you can imagine the guys or to

47
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:32,290
grid love conditions weird you to scream
like a drugs like

48
00:02:32,290 --> 00:02:35,290
it again you know how to printer which
cost like 50 bucks

49
00:02:35,290 --> 00:02:39,050
to do this high throughput rate
experiment that Sage that's huge

50
00:02:39,050 --> 00:02:42,870
%um Victor discoveries the drop like two
hundred million dollars in doing

51
00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:46,250
hunting so yeah very in when you think
about it

52
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:50,220
you know medicine my dad taught tells me
don't call it drugs

53
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:53,310
when you're talking to people as it
sounds that sucks medicine

54
00:02:53,310 --> 00:02:56,319
arm but you know early you know

55
00:02:56,319 --> 00:03:00,989
medicine and the drug industry is
important because that's having a lot of

56
00:03:00,989 --> 00:03:02,150
our life-saving

57
00:03:02,150 --> 00:03:06,450
medicine but medicine has been around a
lot longer than

58
00:03:06,450 --> 00:03:09,540
then the industrial complex a lot longer
than big drug companies

59
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:13,440
and people regular people have been
discovering medicine from long long time

60
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:13,849
ago

61
00:03:13,849 --> 00:03:18,150
and I don't see any reason why %ah you
know things could change again where we

62
00:03:18,150 --> 00:03:18,810
take back

63
00:03:18,810 --> 00:03:22,209
medical research in regards to medicine
or things back into you that the

64
00:03:22,209 --> 00:03:23,300
citizenry where

65
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:26,750
a lot more people are involved we can
get potentially life-saving medicine

66
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:28,120
faster cheaper

67
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:34,170
better quality or whenever so I'm just
just think about that xanada canada

68
00:03:34,170 --> 00:03:37,470
and great hit

69
00:03:37,470 --> 00:03:41,290
I am yes so I was thinking of

70
00:03:41,290 --> 00:03:44,580
the on the rate but zombies for their
therefore spaces

71
00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:47,620
going on right now ideal this one is by
a space

72
00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:51,830
and and that's in Victoria BC I am

73
00:03:51,830 --> 00:03:55,590
and Mercer ID it there is a universe the

74
00:03:55,590 --> 00:03:59,140
shared space now so the public place is
set up in their their spending

75
00:03:59,140 --> 00:04:02,780
i dooo Vancouver is and

76
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:06,530
also dairy they're doing their the
course of things like powered space they

77
00:04:06,530 --> 00:04:08,239
will have licked their own dedicated
space yet

78
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:11,920
but there you know gabled Maker Faires
and things like that I'm

79
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:15,750
and then pick a BIOS probably the newest
one and we're also can have some later

80
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:17,410
TI doubtfire Vancouver

81
00:04:17,410 --> 00:04:20,989
but cool product that's that they're
working on now is

82
00:04:20,989 --> 00:04:24,509
doing microfluidics %uh fermentation so
you know

83
00:04:24,509 --> 00:04:28,509
you'd have you make off with device and
then you do your fermentation action and

84
00:04:28,509 --> 00:04:29,460
then you have a good rapport

85
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:32,840
beers like that an which is hilarious

86
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:37,130
a.m. so is does that mean that we can
expect in five or six years that

87
00:04:37,130 --> 00:04:40,360
iPhone 8 will be able to squeeze it and
beer

88
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:43,630
will drop it yeah that more

89
00:04:43,630 --> 00:04:47,300
pure grain alcohol their medicine at I'd
buy it

90
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:51,720
and am and then do you know you know
peeling or more about us writer

91
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:55,460
yes %uh there's also doin by a Toronto
which is unique in Canada

92
00:04:55,460 --> 00:04:59,100
on in that you know they have been
orphaned they haven't had a space

93
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:04,500
caller on the been working out have om a
hack space they're called pack lab .to

94
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:07,770
and because toronto is Canada's largest
city

95
00:05:07,770 --> 00:05:12,039
people there you know words spread
pretty fast so to put in context like

96
00:05:12,039 --> 00:05:15,669
by a space Victoria Dr Vancouver become
by Montreal

97
00:05:15,669 --> 00:05:18,910
have a vote 30 or 40 members

98
00:05:18,910 --> 00:05:22,990
hour's delay about ron has about 300
members

99
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:26,580
which is really exciting and and there's
a a process now to you

100
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:30,220
try and find these people a real home so
they can get those numbers and start

101
00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:31,220
putting them to you

102
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:35,320
work and do cool things arm and maybe
you know

103
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:39,419
do something cool on

104
00:05:39,419 --> 00:05:42,639
says being a the Inc for a printer

105
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:45,970
I am this is a protective group called
lot yes

106
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:50,860
and their inner Paris I and they
basically this is like in not

107
00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:54,150
9 genetically-engineered thing at all
it's just a bacteria that can

108
00:05:54,150 --> 00:05:58,860
and you know produce this blue Inc
pounds so now they're

109
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:01,759
building this up in the gonna do it
release everything I think there this

110
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:02,520
year

111
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:05,750
I where they'll basically sell this open

112
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:10,650
bacteria and shares mission you know BD
this kit we can grow a bunch of

113
00:06:10,650 --> 00:06:14,210
thinking pretty independent requisite
stuff so serrie

114
00:06:14,210 --> 00:06:17,729
so that I D is happening then with
growing groaning yeah exactly so you

115
00:06:17,729 --> 00:06:18,090
know

116
00:06:18,090 --> 00:06:21,550
this right now is that he's just mostly
pens but you know how long it was a

117
00:06:21,550 --> 00:06:23,139
mistake in the pictures and then

118
00:06:23,139 --> 00:06:26,889
for japan's like it's like i mean as as
we said if printer ink is so expensive

119
00:06:26,889 --> 00:06:28,800
it seems like there's a market there

120
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:31,819
for somebody to say okay well I'm gonna
growing

121
00:06:31,819 --> 00:06:34,840
at pennies for unit

122
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:39,080
and sell it I don't know half the price
a printer ink and still make a killing

123
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:43,360
that sounds like a reasonable thing that
could happen area

124
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:48,600
heard it here first

125
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:51,330
and just to mention another product that
north or 45 this is

126
00:06:51,330 --> 00:06:54,700
from 10 space which is your new york and
so

127
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:58,900
this is a a targets and then she went to
last st some teeny barcoding

128
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:02,520
I'm which is essentially you

129
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:06,360
fun looking you're looking for by

130
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:09,730
listening idea its it's it's like a
fingerprinting so

131
00:07:09,730 --> 00:07:13,090
year by you every organism has unique
DNA

132
00:07:13,090 --> 00:07:16,700
my teen is different from that arose oMG
thats

133
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:19,790
because the genetic code tells my body
had a groan when you think about it

134
00:07:19,790 --> 00:07:23,260
arose in the human are made it have
generally the same

135
00:07:23,260 --> 00:07:27,280
materials a lotta Carbonneau water water
sugars

136
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:31,340
assaults various minerals and whatnot
but the DNA is a program that tells our

137
00:07:31,340 --> 00:07:32,810
cellular machinery how to

138
00:07:32,810 --> 00:07:36,120
configure itself itself replicating self
growing machine

139
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:40,110
and I'm it's interesting because you
know there's been some stories where you

140
00:07:40,110 --> 00:07:42,419
go to a fancy restaurant and they're
selling you

141
00:07:42,419 --> 00:07:46,169
I don't know some super expensive rare

142
00:07:46,169 --> 00:07:49,530
turtle or something like that for dinner
and I

143
00:07:49,530 --> 00:07:53,040
and and you like a law is this really
that rare turtle

144
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:56,270
and paying to earn dollars for this a.m.
I getting my money's worth

145
00:07:56,270 --> 00:08:00,270
and it's possible using DNA barcoding to
take a little

146
00:08:00,270 --> 00:08:03,600
a sample love that turtle

147
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:07,250
and put it through a process where you
extract the DNA user

148
00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:10,550
another process called PCR and women
before police in reaction

149
00:08:10,550 --> 00:08:13,600
to ample fight the amount of diesel the
other an amount in it that you can

150
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:14,400
actually do some

151
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:17,669
some now Sasan and then what you do is
you %um

152
00:08:17,669 --> 00:08:21,580
ago DNA chromatograph it's like you you
do process where at the end of it you

153
00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:22,490
had a picture

154
00:08:22,490 --> 00:08:26,620
up the DNA where it's like shows you
these little latter

155
00:08:26,620 --> 00:08:30,100
and you can be easily compare that the
same way that a a person

156
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:34,380
forensic officer comparing IOM
fingerprints with overlap the two

157
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:37,849
arm and you do this with this DNA graph
and if

158
00:08:37,849 --> 00:08:38,390
there

159
00:08:38,390 --> 00:08:42,050
if they match really well then okay yeah
that's the girl they don't match

160
00:08:42,050 --> 00:08:45,390
then you can go back to that restaurant
and say listen you guys are ripping

161
00:08:45,390 --> 00:08:47,170
people off on a call a newspaper

162
00:08:47,170 --> 00:08:50,690
arm and people have actually been doing
this there's a story a while ago of

163
00:08:50,690 --> 00:08:53,930
some retesting fish and it turned out
that the fish was in

164
00:08:53,930 --> 00:08:56,940
like tons of fish the people by
restaurants is the fish that they tell

165
00:08:56,940 --> 00:08:57,490
you this

166
00:08:57,490 --> 00:09:01,329
his people can really tell on select
like it. fish now because these people

167
00:09:01,329 --> 00:09:05,060
can tell the difference summer league
and the you know stuff like is this

168
00:09:05,060 --> 00:09:07,600
really like you know be four scores
kinda thing is some

169
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:11,940
there's interested in these you know
your stories and so the other

170
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:15,050
same idea except you going to the
wildlife and taking his bar codes and

171
00:09:15,050 --> 00:09:17,230
then locking them so you know what's our
lives there

172
00:09:17,230 --> 00:09:24,230
compared between different places and so
it but we have here is um

173
00:09:24,350 --> 00:09:28,540
I think that a a few things that were
involved in so it's Simba is um

174
00:09:28,540 --> 00:09:31,870
it some tools and get into but what's
really exciting is

175
00:09:31,870 --> 00:09:35,470
this thing called the lease in factory
and it is

176
00:09:35,470 --> 00:09:38,560
a wet where product a wet where kit so

177
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:42,310
your computer's our hardware and
hardware and software

178
00:09:42,310 --> 00:09:45,839
well if we continue in in into talk and

179
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:49,760
you know computing terms in it. terms in
in biotech well then there's

180
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:52,910
wet where recall where it's actually wet
there's liquids in there

181
00:09:52,910 --> 00:09:56,890
and this is a this is a really
interesting product that's come out it's

182
00:09:56,890 --> 00:09:57,140
a

183
00:09:57,110 --> 00:10:00,190
through a a partnership with genomic on
and symbiotic

184
00:10:00,190 --> 00:10:03,589
and I'm here with sinbad as I'm work
with them I'm

185
00:10:03,589 --> 00:10:06,640
up but what it is its a up its

186
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:09,910
its I guess you think a bit like an
Arduino for biotech in that

187
00:10:09,910 --> 00:10:14,730
is a like an R&D platform that is
extensible that you can build up

188
00:10:14,730 --> 00:10:19,260
custom organisms custom microbes that
will do things for you

189
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:24,040
and this one is a kit that comes with
everything you need all these DNA parts

190
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:25,800
and an assembly protocol

191
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:30,690
that allows you to create a micro but I
P E coli that produces a product called

192
00:10:30,690 --> 00:10:31,630
view leeson

193
00:10:31,630 --> 00:10:35,910
and anyone heard of the lease in before
yet gotten

194
00:10:35,910 --> 00:10:39,230
no one knows about this probably one of
the reasons no one knows about it is no

195
00:10:39,230 --> 00:10:41,220
one talks about it in reason on talks
about it

196
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:44,890
because it cost $350 million dollars per
kilo

197
00:10:44,890 --> 00:10:48,990
and it's sold by a company called
sigma-aldrich

198
00:10:48,990 --> 00:10:52,230
and I its purchased by researchers

199
00:10:52,230 --> 00:10:55,250
oMG who are working trying to find Oct

200
00:10:55,250 --> 00:10:59,120
cheers therapies for cancer and so this

201
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:03,000
is a it's not a drug it's not a mess in
its research compound

202
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:07,360
that is on into the process of figuring
okays is something that we can use for

203
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:11,089
for cancer therapeutics but the problem
is researchers

204
00:11:11,089 --> 00:11:13,420
it's very difficult for them to get
their hands on it is just so darn

205
00:11:13,420 --> 00:11:14,110
expensive

206
00:11:14,110 --> 00:11:18,810
and so so what we did at Sinbad and the
genomic on we decided to take their wet

207
00:11:18,810 --> 00:11:19,870
where cat platform

208
00:11:19,870 --> 00:11:23,250
called the genomic on kit which they
originally had

209
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:27,600
that allows you to create hi these these
pictures that we should before very

210
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:28,510
similar to this where

211
00:11:28,510 --> 00:11:32,370
you can have your hello world in program
your E-coli to express different

212
00:11:32,370 --> 00:11:34,190
proteins that are different colors

213
00:11:34,190 --> 00:11:37,949
we thought okay well that's cool but
what's the next step our people building

214
00:11:37,949 --> 00:11:41,060
modules like Arduino shields for this
product

215
00:11:41,060 --> 00:11:44,779
and they said no knowns and the same
okay well we want to build the first one

216
00:11:44,779 --> 00:11:46,420
and you want to do this delay something

217
00:11:46,420 --> 00:11:50,720
and so what we've done is created this
kit %uh

218
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:54,350
it sells for for 550 bucks

219
00:11:54,350 --> 00:11:57,850
Canadian arm and we've sold about 20 of
them I

220
00:11:57,850 --> 00:12:01,250
to YouTube people and stayed stable in
Canada

221
00:12:01,250 --> 00:12:05,160
people in Europe arm and what they're
doing is they are building this kit

222
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:09,699
because its modular they are putting the
kit together in unique ways to see

223
00:12:09,699 --> 00:12:14,279
if they can come up with that the design
that produces the most

224
00:12:14,279 --> 00:12:17,440
velly since so to get the most bang for
your buck added this product

225
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:20,959
and there was a student I maybe I can

226
00:12:20,959 --> 00:12:25,680
I can find it here there's a student
from Canada name

227
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:29,970
a hundred system and he bought one of
these kids he's a grad student

228
00:12:29,970 --> 00:12:33,470
working biology and his PI

229
00:12:33,470 --> 00:12:36,770
Adam working on a project that he was a
super keen on but he

230
00:12:36,770 --> 00:12:41,410
he got when this product he bought it
let's see if I can find here

231
00:12:41,410 --> 00:12:45,790
treason samples and he built the kit

232
00:12:45,790 --> 00:12:50,110
a multiple times in changing the the
design of the DNA

233
00:12:50,110 --> 00:12:56,230
here and he actually came up with the
design

234
00:12:56,230 --> 00:13:00,390
I that was very very good I'm and he so
this is

235
00:13:00,390 --> 00:13:05,059
this is his basically his lab book that
he's made open to the world so anyone

236
00:13:05,059 --> 00:13:06,720
can go in there and look at

237
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:10,689
his DNA designs arm and also give them
access to the tools that he used to do

238
00:13:10,689 --> 00:13:11,089
it

239
00:13:11,089 --> 00:13:15,400
which is totally not how big pharma does
things

240
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:19,339
at all on but he let's let's see if we
can look at his daily here so

241
00:13:19,339 --> 00:13:21,699
transformation results

242
00:13:21,699 --> 00:13:26,500
think this one has some cool pictures so
here we go so here here was a control

243
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:29,600
these ones didn't work then %uh purple
on these ones are green for yellow

244
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:29,959
rather

245
00:13:29,959 --> 00:13:33,760
these ones didn't work these ones didn't
work those ones didn't work I'll

246
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:38,279
here's some yours some purple and blue
purple really sinister plot was called

247
00:13:38,279 --> 00:13:41,880
by libya leeson if it's purple than you
know the the medical

248
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:45,100
compounds there com and so he wound up

249
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:49,110
other similar ones near but anyways he
wound up designing a genetic

250
00:13:49,110 --> 00:13:52,209
circuit that did a very good job this

251
00:13:52,209 --> 00:13:55,260
and he's now in the process love
figuring out how he can

252
00:13:55,260 --> 00:13:58,920
extract the lease in and distillate and
and selling

253
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:02,209
he's a young guy I think he's slick 28
years to kids

254
00:14:02,209 --> 00:14:06,839
he's in school and he made some cash and
he's really motivated to be like a

255
00:14:06,839 --> 00:14:10,220
why why is sigma-aldrich the only coming
to cancel this

256
00:14:10,220 --> 00:14:13,459
I'm gonna go ahead and do it arm and
we're really excited about this because

257
00:14:13,459 --> 00:14:17,220
it serve a proof-of-concept wears like
you know there's a huge boom in

258
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:20,160
computing because people like hey wait a
minute this is accessible

259
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:24,120
and I can make a tight cash doing this
and I can do a lot of good I can

260
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:28,319
make a valuable product for people arm
and and life science biotech

261
00:14:28,319 --> 00:14:31,589
is is with their like this is truly
happening now

262
00:14:31,589 --> 00:14:34,890
arm and certainly by the next hope
there's gonna be people up here

263
00:14:34,890 --> 00:14:40,480
showing off their files I love THC

264
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:43,600
viagara calls like that yet

265
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:48,020
dynamite you awesome young asian
countries that have been impressive just

266
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:52,029
with the RGB which the to make you know
red in blue

267
00:14:52,029 --> 00:14:55,069
I victory that glow I would force a
protein

268
00:14:55,069 --> 00:14:58,319
and it's like designed in such a way
that's it's not at all like the

269
00:14:58,319 --> 00:14:59,319
traditional

270
00:14:59,319 --> 00:15:02,870
I you know biochemistry molecular
biology techniques doing it

271
00:15:02,870 --> 00:15:06,559
and installation is simply I'm

272
00:15:06,559 --> 00:15:09,740
a picture but either way the halls of
the point is is very you know

273
00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:13,309
user friendly kinda thing I've doing the
assembly up the DNA

274
00:15:13,309 --> 00:15:16,689
I mean you can look up the details on
how it works and I could go through it

275
00:15:16,689 --> 00:15:17,140
but

276
00:15:17,140 --> 00:15:21,339
knaves like larry has a beber a.m.

277
00:15:21,339 --> 00:15:26,260
yet ISA you'll get get the 10 friends
and experts in like 20 bucks and buy one

278
00:15:26,260 --> 00:15:26,980
is getting

279
00:15:26,980 --> 00:15:31,470
have some fun and you can go on and and
I look at other people's work

280
00:15:31,470 --> 00:15:35,500
and if you dislike flight at wanna make
me feel AC don't wanna do experiments

281
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:39,399
just follow the other person's protocol
annual you know by the end of two weeks

282
00:15:39,399 --> 00:15:42,770
you'll probably have like 20 grand with
Avi leeson

283
00:15:42,770 --> 00:15:46,520
I in your fridge gonna have to find a
way to extracted

284
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:51,339
and legally sell it

285
00:15:51,339 --> 00:15:54,740
but you know those are cool I mean we're
hackers rate you guys gotta fear at

286
00:15:54,740 --> 00:15:55,300
these

287
00:15:55,300 --> 00:16:00,309
gotta figure out these problems because
they're the opportunities there

288
00:16:00,309 --> 00:16:03,589
and service the product and working on
in this in my ass others being a tease

289
00:16:03,589 --> 00:16:04,550
the SE

290
00:16:04,550 --> 00:16:08,010
just mentioned I am yes so

291
00:16:08,010 --> 00:16:12,890
Serena trimix East I can produce THC and

292
00:16:12,890 --> 00:16:15,970
and yet and it will bring to do
something with it and

293
00:16:15,970 --> 00:16:19,020
poly X Factor for

294
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:23,079
on

295
00:16:23,079 --> 00:16:25,870
me it's super funny to think about what
you're gonna wear imagination can go

296
00:16:25,870 --> 00:16:28,350
with this kinda thing like you know is
this

297
00:16:28,350 --> 00:16:31,670
you know I do is from sickle products
but you know its features is

298
00:16:31,670 --> 00:16:36,069
same time so on what's really cool about
using yeast and thinking about

299
00:16:36,069 --> 00:16:39,949
East as a microbial factory when you
think the factories

300
00:16:39,949 --> 00:16:43,449
their huge multi-million dollar 100
million dollar billion dollar

301
00:16:43,449 --> 00:16:47,649
machines their architectural that are
owned by big companies

302
00:16:47,649 --> 00:16:51,410
arm and they're doing similar things
that biology does biology are machines

303
00:16:51,410 --> 00:16:53,399
that grow things and make things right

304
00:16:53,399 --> 00:16:57,120
and so if we can find a way to program
or or hijack East

305
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:00,189
to produce other valuable products aside
from

306
00:17:00,189 --> 00:17:04,610
puffy bread and beer then that's really
exciting right because think about it

307
00:17:04,610 --> 00:17:05,909
you know how long have

308
00:17:05,909 --> 00:17:10,880
humans been making beer and wine 10,000
years fifteen thousand years

309
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:13,560
twenty thousand years I don't know a
long time definitely definitely

310
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:15,120
thousands of years for sure

311
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:18,159
people have been using a East as as

312
00:17:18,159 --> 00:17:21,220
as a tool to turn inexpensive products
like

313
00:17:21,220 --> 00:17:25,089
sugary water grape juice into a
high-value

314
00:17:25,089 --> 00:17:28,059
fantastically exciting product

315
00:17:28,059 --> 00:17:32,460
like like wine you know how some wine is
hundreds of dollars for a moderate

316
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:35,899
but it's just so great use to start and
it's these microbes that

317
00:17:35,899 --> 00:17:39,409
eat the sugar PO wine

318
00:17:39,409 --> 00:17:43,740
and then we drink it right and soaks up
its cool but when he think I think about

319
00:17:43,740 --> 00:17:44,630
how they make beer

320
00:17:44,630 --> 00:17:48,100
beers mean small batches anyone here
maybe a small bash in their garage or

321
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:49,009
basement rhetorical

322
00:17:49,009 --> 00:17:53,529
awesome me too anyone here may be really
huge large factory owned by the batter

323
00:17:53,529 --> 00:17:54,240
Moulson

324
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:57,920
wall with a brewmaster in the house

325
00:17:57,920 --> 00:18:01,890
cool awesome but but those machines cost
millions hundreds millions of dollars

326
00:18:01,890 --> 00:18:02,630
but you get to make

327
00:18:02,630 --> 00:18:07,040
beer at scale and sell make big bucks
but when it comes down to it the process

328
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:08,150
is exactly the same

329
00:18:08,150 --> 00:18:11,570
right you can it's it's a totally
scaleable technology

330
00:18:11,570 --> 00:18:14,600
and if we can use that idea net

331
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:18,400
thinking to produce other products in
addition to THC like

332
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:21,650
any other kind of biological product if
that we can do it that way

333
00:18:21,650 --> 00:18:25,590
that's a really to me is a really
exciting idea really potentially

334
00:18:25,590 --> 00:18:30,180
super duper lucrative idea yet and he
just think about plants themselves as

335
00:18:30,180 --> 00:18:30,650
like

336
00:18:30,650 --> 00:18:33,880
you know be able to piece is common on
their own a plant is the key couple used

337
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:34,530
to grow but

338
00:18:34,530 --> 00:18:37,820
if you think about Eastin this
exponentially growing

339
00:18:37,820 --> 00:18:41,180
thing you can get that same amount
biomass like a week for 22 years a

340
00:18:41,180 --> 00:18:41,840
pro-growth

341
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:46,310
so and so this is the end of the
beginning

342
00:18:46,310 --> 00:18:50,840
arm we're gonna put a challenge out so
I've been reading 2600 the hacker

343
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:54,480
quarterly since I was 12 or 13 or
something like that arm

344
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:58,660
and and in this whole time I mean I've
missed a few issues here and then

345
00:18:58,660 --> 00:19:03,130
here and there I but I've never seen by
attacking article and 2600

346
00:19:03,130 --> 00:19:06,280
has head has there been a by having our
content 601

347
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:10,620
yes fair well there needs to be more his
I

348
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:13,640
an easy more so for example is anyone
familiar with

349
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:16,910
riley's by ok older yeah it's pretty
cool

350
00:19:16,910 --> 00:19:20,760
it's a to bring anything they've had 45
issues now

351
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:24,610
om and basically if you you can download
for free arm

352
00:19:24,610 --> 00:19:28,940
these guys are clearly fans a 2600 cuz
if you look at the layout and the kind

353
00:19:28,940 --> 00:19:29,520
of Content

354
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:32,950
it's very similar to a 6-under back
accordingly but it's for bio

355
00:19:32,950 --> 00:19:36,220
comment if you read their mass and it
says rip the start a revolution that

356
00:19:36,220 --> 00:19:39,690
will transform our lives as radically is
a computer revolution in the seventies

357
00:19:39,690 --> 00:19:43,070
the biological revolution will touch
every aspect of our lives

358
00:19:43,070 --> 00:19:47,180
food and health certainly but also art
recreation law business

359
00:19:47,180 --> 00:19:50,700
and much more and so to me that sounds
like a really cool arm

360
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:54,280
we to stoke some fire so I'm hoping that
weekend some

361
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:57,670
you know make sure that the 2600
community also

362
00:19:57,670 --> 00:20:01,840
kinda participate in this as well and
doesn't let Riley own the whole space

363
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:05,690
on and I guess a as expanding on the
idea Vienna

364
00:20:05,690 --> 00:20:09,590
the beginning in you know the hackers
the by hackers this is that

365
00:20:09,590 --> 00:20:13,040
sorted out few years ago where more
aware

366
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:16,120
you know what they were doing and how
this late appear to like security

367
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:17,160
agencies things like that

368
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:21,420
or surpass that point where now all the
Securities know that this exists and the

369
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:25,510
are you know where did and they're not
you know no one's afraid to be targeted

370
00:20:25,510 --> 00:20:25,910
anymore

371
00:20:25,910 --> 00:20:31,080
basically I'm ands now people are going
well as supporting the crowdfunding

372
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:34,080
and even you miss minutes municipal
governments are they

373
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:37,880
you know seeing this as like a really
good thing I got this is gonna Jerry

374
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:42,080
capitalist through so many of them and
you look at these is going and so

375
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:45,920
in essence is up more support going for
it now then there was before

376
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:49,040
on and the coolest couple the quality is

377
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:52,260
I I was looking at cribs in today I'm
the crib Sanford

378
00:20:52,260 --> 00:20:55,880
is no caption available devices yet and
you know if you have an expiry

379
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:58,900
you can sequence and find out exactly
out worse the deck level

380
00:20:58,900 --> 00:21:02,460
on and another caller ID on the
corruption thing as we just saw

381
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:03,240
something about

382
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:07,300
DNA testing people and San others it may
be a demand for

383
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:11,610
a way to you encrypt your own DNA sled
people can scan you

384
00:21:11,610 --> 00:21:14,890
some like that or or so or stand like a
basically just

385
00:21:14,890 --> 00:21:19,410
get everyone CNN just put it all over
the place yeah Etsy can imagine Michael

386
00:21:19,410 --> 00:21:22,450
like a weed spray thing they just take
but to people's lives in

387
00:21:22,450 --> 00:21:25,800
anything this love you have a dozen
different people and

388
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:28,830
and it no that's coming up so I

389
00:21:28,830 --> 00:21:33,240
two weeks ago I was at MIT and I was
China some people talking about

390
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:36,340
you know some stuff since we actually
doing science sector and I

391
00:21:36,340 --> 00:21:39,240
a guy said all this is awesome let me
show you what I'm working on these just

392
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:40,440
that finishes PhD

393
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:44,140
and he's working on a basically say it's
a it's a

394
00:21:44,140 --> 00:21:47,660
device it's about this size you know the
sizeof I forever

395
00:21:47,660 --> 00:21:50,820
and it said DNA synthesizer meaning it's
a

396
00:21:50,820 --> 00:21:54,430
it's a tool that actually creates DNA in
the city one thing we didn't talk about

397
00:21:54,430 --> 00:21:59,840
quite yet is DNA synthesis on but so
it's the opposite up DNA sequencing

398
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:02,890
everyone's for DNA sequencing where you
read in your

399
00:22:02,890 --> 00:22:06,190
genetic code and at the end of the day
you've got a text file with your genetic

400
00:22:06,190 --> 00:22:08,700
code on it but we have the technology to
date actually

401
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:13,640
printed that text file arm into a real
piece of DNA that you can put into an

402
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:14,110
organism

403
00:22:14,110 --> 00:22:17,200
on and these are BigMachines you know
the size of a

404
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:21,020
free edger are free agent are getting
smaller and smaller and I actually saw

405
00:22:21,020 --> 00:22:25,240
a guy holding his hand a microfluidic
parade that was for the size of an

406
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:25,820
iPhone

407
00:22:25,820 --> 00:22:31,600
it works you can print DNA on it it runs
off a nine volt battery

408
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:35,470
and I it like I am how much like that's
a prototype its prolly prices

409
00:22:35,470 --> 00:22:39,889
but it was just me and acrylic probably
five bucks worth of stuff

410
00:22:39,889 --> 00:22:43,119
so it's coming and lookin to legal

411
00:22:43,119 --> 00:22:46,929
here cyclical arm

412
00:22:46,929 --> 00:22:50,950
you can make viruses yeah it won't be

413
00:22:50,950 --> 00:22:54,499
as easy as anyone can imagine you know

414
00:22:54,499 --> 00:22:58,009
Maki you this is like the you know your
stuff that people getting over now is a

415
00:22:58,009 --> 00:22:58,759
quick sec me know

416
00:22:58,759 --> 00:23:02,830
oh my god in the fires is but like
really no likes you

417
00:23:02,830 --> 00:23:06,330
a youth you'd probably die before yes
got to that point anything

418
00:23:06,330 --> 00:23:10,019
I you you're you're putting yourself at
risk more than anyone else

419
00:23:10,019 --> 00:23:13,419
and so as far as that that's like

420
00:23:13,419 --> 00:23:16,749
biosafety basically I am and

421
00:23:16,749 --> 00:23:19,889
just doing the site to sell for like to
note is producing the spires isn't

422
00:23:19,889 --> 00:23:23,539
its not even there yet leading edge
science in what month

423
00:23:23,539 --> 00:23:27,259
one thing that was mean only started
setting up bar doin by a group

424
00:23:27,259 --> 00:23:30,989
one other hurdles that we had was that
we didn't know what the law was about

425
00:23:30,989 --> 00:23:31,859
biosafety

426
00:23:31,859 --> 00:23:36,289
and biosecurity we just knew that you
know we did have to take some steps to

427
00:23:36,289 --> 00:23:37,559
make sure that things were safe

428
00:23:37,559 --> 00:23:41,090
but we didn't know what that was and it
was difficult to connect with

429
00:23:41,090 --> 00:23:45,230
you know people in government or whoever
that actually had that

430
00:23:45,230 --> 00:23:48,299
arm and and so you know years later
today

431
00:23:48,299 --> 00:23:51,239
now we do know and what's interesting is
the kinda stuff that's coming into

432
00:23:51,239 --> 00:23:53,580
virtually all DIY Biolabs

433
00:23:53,580 --> 00:23:57,029
isn't even on the radar of up by
security people

434
00:23:57,029 --> 00:24:01,019
no one is working with human pathogens
no one is working with buyers is

435
00:24:01,019 --> 00:24:05,340
the kinda stuff that people are doing
our with lab E-coli

436
00:24:05,340 --> 00:24:09,799
East those kind of things that are
specifically designed to work

437
00:24:09,799 --> 00:24:14,919
in a very specific environment if those
microbes were to leave the petri dish

438
00:24:14,919 --> 00:24:18,340
they would not survive so it's kinda
like um

439
00:24:18,340 --> 00:24:21,739
there's actually the scene in jurassic
park it earlier on scene where

440
00:24:21,739 --> 00:24:26,009
I am you know they've engineered the
dinosaurs to lack a certain

441
00:24:26,009 --> 00:24:29,350
enzymes that they can't exist without
leaving their special feed

442
00:24:29,350 --> 00:24:33,940
thats basically exactly how lab
microorganisms work they've been

443
00:24:33,940 --> 00:24:34,929
engineered to be

444
00:24:34,929 --> 00:24:39,210
week yeah exactly

445
00:24:39,210 --> 00:24:42,809
guys but as you know the yet yet that's
a movie

446
00:24:42,809 --> 00:24:47,779
but you know hey to it's a fantastic
movie

447
00:24:47,779 --> 00:24:50,889
we should we should all watch it we
shall watch it yet

448
00:24:50,889 --> 00:24:54,710
I galleons for anything just forget all
the heightened yet tackles bio

449
00:24:54,710 --> 00:24:57,720
but yet to have a dinosaur you can make
you know the jerseys

450
00:24:57,720 --> 00:25:01,499
thats skin died Andrea

451
00:25:01,499 --> 00:25:06,169
in the wild joins Mike question began to
question serious

452
00:25:06,169 --> 00:25:09,220
and for II

453
00:25:09,220 --> 00:25:12,599
to few more things I have a couple just
couple ideas are like you know

454
00:25:12,599 --> 00:25:16,320
hope we can inspire guesses are working
on anything on

455
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:21,769
there is Lake well you guys are always
find the most mileage that a No

456
00:25:21,769 --> 00:25:25,279
for one like I was tired positions in
touch today and makes

457
00:25:25,279 --> 00:25:28,559
you guys should really so they can send
the stuff and

458
00:25:28,559 --> 00:25:32,549
you get involved find your local by
actor spacers you know I am

459
00:25:32,549 --> 00:25:36,919
star one if there is one I am and the
offer free to reach out to the community

460
00:25:36,919 --> 00:25:40,340
go to do.i bile duct work is accused me
of their deaths just

461
00:25:40,340 --> 00:25:43,570
no really and inspiring as far as
getting stuff going

462
00:25:43,570 --> 00:25:46,619
as a couple things ideas that I once the
app in our

463
00:25:46,619 --> 00:25:50,080
one the city a Programmer's Guide coding
in bio

464
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:53,679
on and I was inspired by the non from
eros guide to

465
00:25:53,679 --> 00:25:57,090
trading in Python but did that and got
the voicemail introductory computer

466
00:25:57,090 --> 00:25:57,639
science course

467
00:25:57,639 --> 00:26:02,809
I'm fish so and that's awesome and I
once like that we're doing bio

468
00:26:02,809 --> 00:26:05,999
and nice thing that I wanna see happen
is that your computer

469
00:26:05,999 --> 00:26:09,869
controls its own temperature it's you
know she did from overheating things

470
00:26:09,869 --> 00:26:10,269
like that

471
00:26:10,269 --> 00:26:13,859
I wanna see somebody puts bacteria in
your computer and treated by reactor

472
00:26:13,859 --> 00:26:14,970
where you can meeting

473
00:26:14,970 --> 00:26:18,230
this consistent temperature and it
wasn't a cherry on it so

474
00:26:18,230 --> 00:26:22,369
sunny know do these things and take to
get the pictures as me and I'll

475
00:26:22,369 --> 00:26:25,669
cause mines something like that on a I'm

476
00:26:25,669 --> 00:26:30,090
yet that's that's I guess I don't say
anything else

477
00:26:30,090 --> 00:26:33,659
on yeah i think i think thats a good
introduction

478
00:26:33,659 --> 00:26:36,590
army don't wanna blow your minds too
much to get started but yet the

479
00:26:36,590 --> 00:26:38,200
resources are all their online

480
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:41,659
connect with us if you have any
questions comments or or

481
00:26:41,659 --> 00:26:46,429
whatever but I guess maybe we can start
taking some questions now i spose

482
00:26:46,429 --> 00:26:51,559
yep the returns may come

483
00:26:51,559 --> 00:26:58,029
were there but none there

484
00:26:58,029 --> 00:27:01,470
there's arms so my question was around

485
00:27:01,470 --> 00:27:04,720
the sequencing various life forms

486
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:08,360
genetic sequences just the
identification potentially a

487
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:12,240
functional components have those ok I
know trying to T

488
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:16,230
you know the raw data and then saying
okay well then this piece is actually

489
00:27:16,230 --> 00:27:17,299
doing this

490
00:27:17,299 --> 00:27:20,490
and so forth you know kinda I guess in a
way

491
00:27:20,490 --> 00:27:23,840
you know developing an old an open
source toolkit love those genetic

492
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:27,360
building blocks right because it's one
thing to say all right well we can take

493
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:31,760
you know the complete sequence from this
glowing being went into this E coli

494
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:35,029
no clothes and that's cool but you know
can you take just

495
00:27:35,029 --> 00:27:38,110
a subset of that and you know
transferred

496
00:27:38,110 --> 00:27:41,690
I guess the question is around have
there been any efforts to

497
00:27:41,690 --> 00:27:46,789
compile a sec that kinda data and make
it available in an open source fashion

498
00:27:46,789 --> 00:27:49,730
yet yet the answer is yes

499
00:27:49,730 --> 00:27:53,399
and muster which once yeah I mean this
is

500
00:27:53,399 --> 00:27:56,769
a bunch I'm Desire X is actually one is
them

501
00:27:56,769 --> 00:27:59,340
problems up there when I think there is
another one that sidelined today a

502
00:27:59,340 --> 00:28:00,260
camera and beaded

503
00:28:00,260 --> 00:28:04,399
on but sad yet parts that I dot org is
the one that's

504
00:28:04,399 --> 00:28:07,450
run by the international agenda the
engineer sheen

505
00:28:07,450 --> 00:28:11,529
competition I'm item yet so

506
00:28:11,529 --> 00:28:14,769
I am this is going to surf around and
look at what

507
00:28:14,769 --> 00:28:18,980
parts have been submitted and the system
in soviet the way it works is that it's

508
00:28:18,980 --> 00:28:22,559
undergraduate research teams that just
work on a project for the summer and

509
00:28:22,559 --> 00:28:25,990
you know 'cause in DNA but in the
experience if it works and then summit

510
00:28:25,990 --> 00:28:26,809
1382

511
00:28:26,809 --> 00:28:30,130
the registry I am answer right now I
think they just

512
00:28:30,130 --> 00:28:33,299
they opened up this year to do I buy
labs I'm hands

513
00:28:33,299 --> 00:28:37,120
the way works that you can just the sand
you first like it stack a party

514
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:40,649
news and then you can request a price
from the registry I'm in to see the case

515
00:28:40,649 --> 00:28:42,070
%uh me this thing that kills

516
00:28:42,070 --> 00:28:46,139
am you know for TCL genuine their CTS
used in there yet

517
00:28:46,139 --> 00:28:49,289
I'm innings be others other

518
00:28:49,289 --> 00:28:53,130
this other repositories like the NCBI
which is open database that you can go

519
00:28:53,130 --> 00:28:53,580
and

520
00:28:53,580 --> 00:28:57,000
search for various organisms and there's
a there's a difference where you know

521
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:01,419
some organisms that are %uh research
organisms are

522
00:29:01,419 --> 00:29:05,139
very highly characterize people know a
lot about it you can go to the database

523
00:29:05,139 --> 00:29:06,200
and find an organism

524
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:09,779
where we have the genetic sequence but
no one knows with the parts do

525
00:29:09,779 --> 00:29:13,960
no one knows what the parts are whenever
I'm sometimes people what they do is

526
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:14,419
they

527
00:29:14,419 --> 00:29:18,700
on they compare known parts to in an
organism see if their similarities

528
00:29:18,700 --> 00:29:23,240
and select pic okay this roses red and
here's his other Florence red okay well

529
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:23,690
maybe

530
00:29:23,690 --> 00:29:28,110
it's similar com but a lot it was
interesting about genetic ozell X

531
00:29:28,110 --> 00:29:29,750
software is written by people

532
00:29:29,750 --> 00:29:32,909
we've we invented computers reinvented

533
00:29:32,909 --> 00:29:37,360
software I'm whereas DNA is our life is

534
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:40,429
pre-existing we did not admit it and so
it's not really a

535
00:29:40,429 --> 00:29:44,029
a process %uh engineering it's a process
of

536
00:29:44,029 --> 00:29:47,620
discovery on which is a little bit
different which is interesting cuz its

537
00:29:47,620 --> 00:29:51,389
I think maybe that could be reason as to
why we see such a a different arm

538
00:29:51,389 --> 00:29:54,559
audience of people there are involved in
by hacking versus

539
00:29:54,559 --> 00:29:58,340
straight up computing I don't know if
anyone would argue with me but when I

540
00:29:58,340 --> 00:30:01,950
was and so in computer science ninety
percent of the people my class were guys

541
00:30:01,950 --> 00:30:06,320
om but that's not the case with bio when
I was in bio class is it was

542
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:10,880
50/50 or maybe even suede I more towards
female side which is going to be

543
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:15,740
interesting arm opportunity for a whole
new group of people to get involved in

544
00:30:15,740 --> 00:30:16,860
this evidentiary

545
00:30:16,860 --> 00:30:20,809
firms from an explosion

546
00:30:20,809 --> 00:30:24,740
arm so I'm interested with the on

547
00:30:24,740 --> 00:30:30,490
talking about decrease in cost of
production for drugs

548
00:30:30,490 --> 00:30:34,090
and how that relates to pounds because I
know that one of the frequently raised

549
00:30:34,090 --> 00:30:37,879
arguments for through maintaining a
patent system all

550
00:30:37,879 --> 00:30:41,659
is that it's such a high cost am also
interested

551
00:30:41,659 --> 00:30:46,899
he say that a lot of these furtive tools
are becoming small an open-source

552
00:30:46,899 --> 00:30:50,139
and I know that with 3d printing one the

553
00:30:50,139 --> 00:30:53,399
things with it just happened to sort of
gloom has

554
00:30:53,399 --> 00:30:58,179
hands were falling out of there
time-line do you know if the current

555
00:30:58,179 --> 00:30:58,620
round

556
00:30:58,620 --> 00:31:02,570
I'll tools are actually coming out of
hand right now or is this going to be an

557
00:31:02,570 --> 00:31:03,340
issue where

558
00:31:03,340 --> 00:31:07,240
the patent like anything there's there's
always issues with IP

559
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:11,429
one of the reasons why we chose to a
target feel a sin for our

560
00:31:11,429 --> 00:31:15,529
are wet where kit was it deletion is a
naturally-occurring compound

561
00:31:15,529 --> 00:31:18,620
it's not something that was invented by
somebody that would be under

562
00:31:18,620 --> 00:31:22,260
IP constraints om that yet that is a
problem

563
00:31:22,260 --> 00:31:26,370
and really no one knows what to do
there's a couple

564
00:31:26,370 --> 00:31:30,419
there's a issue love a tool called
genome compiler which is a

565
00:31:30,419 --> 00:31:35,240
DNA design tool calm and the had gooey
the allergy to

566
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:38,960
organize your your genetic code om and
they actually

567
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:43,600
were hit with a patent infringement case
from teeny 2.0 saying that we own

568
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:46,940
the the patent on using a gooey

569
00:31:46,940 --> 00:31:52,149
to manipulate a text file and the I mean
somebody gave a net Patton and the

570
00:31:52,149 --> 00:31:55,740
had to come to an agreement and that's
unfortunate

571
00:31:55,740 --> 00:31:58,539
but the good news times don't last
forever and there's there's think

572
00:31:58,539 --> 00:31:59,919
there's a there's a keypad

573
00:31:59,919 --> 00:32:03,159
is a keypad for DNA synthesis I believe
that

574
00:32:03,159 --> 00:32:06,299
as a DNA synthesis is a patented process
right now

575
00:32:06,299 --> 00:32:11,230
but wanted to keep at Cinespace is set
to expire in 2014 or 2015

576
00:32:11,230 --> 00:32:15,510
I'm so it's going to be exciting to see
some of the smaller groups that maybe

577
00:32:15,510 --> 00:32:17,649
had the technology available but

578
00:32:17,649 --> 00:32:20,700
I you can't bring it out for

579
00:32:20,700 --> 00:32:23,760
for IP fears Tim soon will be able to do
so

580
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:28,090
keep keep your eye on a would be too
careful there about the possibility of

581
00:32:28,090 --> 00:32:29,350
miss you so mean

582
00:32:29,350 --> 00:32:33,610
a bad guy to kidnap you June take you to
an evil lab somewhere but

583
00:32:33,610 --> 00:32:37,779
when everyone asked about his the who's
a piece on as it happens go camera that

584
00:32:37,779 --> 00:32:38,470
the

585
00:32:38,470 --> 00:32:41,770
are the new new genetic alphabet letters
with

586
00:32:41,770 --> 00:32:45,850
know the promise ring see ATG home porn
do you think that action why in a

587
00:32:45,850 --> 00:32:47,190
concept is going to be

588
00:32:47,190 --> 00:32:51,029
well that really change things I think
you will I think it's in this an example

589
00:32:51,029 --> 00:32:54,500
love how malleable life is and how
malleable these

590
00:32:54,500 --> 00:32:58,289
self-replicating by owning a robots are
if we can

591
00:32:58,289 --> 00:33:01,450
add extra pieces to it have them still
work maybe does it make

592
00:33:01,450 --> 00:33:04,700
the codes more expressive to have two
extra characters I don't know

593
00:33:04,700 --> 00:33:08,260
are you coming out right here are you
going on a rule sarisi are you going to

594
00:33:08,260 --> 00:33:10,200
go down that road alone try to

595
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:14,110
child-care yeah I mean party like
synthetic biology assaults to you

596
00:33:14,110 --> 00:33:17,820
I learn how these fundamental organisms
work by rebuilding them from scratch

597
00:33:17,820 --> 00:33:18,730
kinda thing

598
00:33:18,730 --> 00:33:22,119
so you know that's that's a very good
example you know maybe

599
00:33:22,119 --> 00:33:25,919
eons ago in the first organisms they had
like a dozen different kinds bases and

600
00:33:25,919 --> 00:33:29,460
this year too that were there and now
they're not there's something back

601
00:33:29,460 --> 00:33:32,740
its its sole really really cool and I'm

602
00:33:32,740 --> 00:33:35,020
yet you know he can think at times
according up visions whenever is the

603
00:33:35,020 --> 00:33:36,980
same as

604
00:33:36,980 --> 00:33:43,279
paint on the team i kidnap you okay

605
00:33:43,279 --> 00:33:48,190
I I'm I was wondering how difficult do
you think it would be too

606
00:33:48,190 --> 00:33:51,429
so to create I think arbitrary pathway

607
00:33:51,429 --> 00:33:55,139
so like an arbitrary metabolic pathways
are discovering one in nature

608
00:33:55,139 --> 00:33:59,260
you find some product some protein
product that you wanna synthesize

609
00:33:59,260 --> 00:34:03,830
and you just sorta get the sequence from
that mean you inject the sequence

610
00:34:03,830 --> 00:34:07,760
in one of these sorta tabletop systems
like is that as a possible

611
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:11,889
yep exactly pretty much need yeah
exactly describe to you find sequences

612
00:34:11,889 --> 00:34:12,800
and then you can

613
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:16,530
on the specimen they could be you know
the just for us a person's was just low

614
00:34:16,530 --> 00:34:19,810
or they could be enzymes that's you know
converts I am

615
00:34:19,810 --> 00:34:24,190
sugar into some my way see sir I'm
that's what I was a kid is

616
00:34:24,190 --> 00:34:27,589
that so I i guess i reset the wrong way
I mean what are the whether restrictions

617
00:34:27,589 --> 00:34:28,069
on my

618
00:34:28,069 --> 00:34:31,290
arbitrary pathways that for example
there's some bacteria that

619
00:34:31,290 --> 00:34:35,250
that do electron transport right they
just process electron so

620
00:34:35,250 --> 00:34:39,659
yeah presumably like you could use that
make us our class a computer right by

621
00:34:39,659 --> 00:34:43,919
growing bacteria netting pathways to
them

622
00:34:43,919 --> 00:34:49,720
bad works that way rates Utah commitment
to giving the up-front transport

623
00:34:49,720 --> 00:34:54,129
Jasola creating an alternate chain so
that you can actually create logic gates

624
00:34:54,129 --> 00:34:55,240
with an

625
00:34:55,240 --> 00:34:58,420
bring cultures bacteria yeah exactly at
what

626
00:34:58,420 --> 00:35:01,950
it's totally that's that's a good thats
synthetic biology is

627
00:35:01,950 --> 00:35:05,700
creating is sort of systems that and to
do these kinds of things

628
00:35:05,700 --> 00:35:09,650
and as far as and yeah I mustered I'm

629
00:35:09,650 --> 00:35:13,170
maybe it didn't quite get a question
cell but Dr freeing our pitchers this is

630
00:35:13,170 --> 00:35:13,910
like that is

631
00:35:13,910 --> 00:35:18,369
see a you can definitely do that maybe
eight you know where things go in the

632
00:35:18,369 --> 00:35:19,300
cell and

633
00:35:19,300 --> 00:35:22,319
they have their own system setup and so
ideally when you're trying to freeze a

634
00:35:22,319 --> 00:35:25,300
drug you on tap into this is an
important resource from it

635
00:35:25,300 --> 00:35:28,520
and Tino even on that level then you can
manipulate

636
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:33,940
its to enhance isn't I wasn't in the
direction of your drug pathway basically

637
00:35:33,940 --> 00:35:38,820
thank you

638
00:35:38,820 --> 00:35:41,830
are I'm so I was a big hug with the

639
00:35:41,830 --> 00:35:46,300
current state of the art is a for
flexibility in creating weird switzer

640
00:35:46,300 --> 00:35:49,810
Park organisms and jeans like do you
need

641
00:35:49,810 --> 00:35:53,920
the gene to be in somebody's catalog
user through the arbitrary sequences up

642
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:54,910
between you know what

643
00:35:54,910 --> 00:35:59,690
either or I mean you can right now he
just like very much letters like that

644
00:35:59,690 --> 00:36:00,960
like water on Lake I

645
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:04,410
you know ittt diskettes incise I'm you
may not do anything

646
00:36:04,410 --> 00:36:07,470
bites on you know there's a chance it
would do anything

647
00:36:07,470 --> 00:36:11,150
I'm will ensure that but see that can't
you get

648
00:36:11,150 --> 00:36:14,830
the arbitrary surfaces supported a
delight for yeah I mean you can look up

649
00:36:14,830 --> 00:36:16,660
online to find the guy with the sequence
for

650
00:36:16,660 --> 00:36:21,270
party even say like order and deal just
sent you an email you put any bacterial

651
00:36:21,270 --> 00:36:21,650
glow

652
00:36:21,650 --> 00:36:24,950
and time there's one thing that we
didn't discuss it so we've been talking

653
00:36:24,950 --> 00:36:25,320
about

654
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:28,400
in a purely by like coding for purely
biological functions

655
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:32,140
you can code for logical functions as
well because if deion DNA is a

656
00:36:32,140 --> 00:36:36,369
information storage medium you could
translate a poem

657
00:36:36,369 --> 00:36:41,310
into DNA code representation and put
that DNA code into an organism

658
00:36:41,310 --> 00:36:45,470
and then have that organism live immune
if you put in the right place so doesn't

659
00:36:45,470 --> 00:36:46,240
kill it

660
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:50,609
a bit with live in replicating grow NBC
what you've got is a machine

661
00:36:50,609 --> 00:36:54,839
that makes copies of that poem and it
exponentially increases the number of

662
00:36:54,839 --> 00:36:55,250
poems

663
00:36:55,250 --> 00:36:58,290
this has been something that sorry done
by Keane poet I

664
00:36:58,290 --> 00:37:02,160
a number of years ago I'm but that that
some again so we can touch on that there

665
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:02,599
are

666
00:37:02,599 --> 00:37:05,599
are logical uses 14 is a

667
00:37:05,599 --> 00:37:08,730
information storage medium that has
nothing to do with life yet

668
00:37:08,730 --> 00:37:12,099
DNA is like really really stable if set
room temperatures that people are

669
00:37:12,099 --> 00:37:13,170
bringing stuff like

670
00:37:13,170 --> 00:37:16,540
shakespearian Mozart and according to
DNA just for long-term storage

671
00:37:16,540 --> 00:37:20,010
anything and that's that's that's
typical that that should write that

672
00:37:20,010 --> 00:37:20,440
extra

673
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:27,089
such as crazy thank you so

674
00:37:27,089 --> 00:37:31,240
your made the arm pretty common analogy
that both the genomes and computer

675
00:37:31,240 --> 00:37:32,160
programs are code

676
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:35,960
number computer programs are usually
written in a high-level language that's

677
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:38,270
readable by humans with a well-defined
semantics

678
00:37:38,270 --> 00:37:41,710
so is there anything like that

679
00:37:41,710 --> 00:37:45,770
forward the the code for genome or is
that a misleading analogy there

680
00:37:45,770 --> 00:37:49,109
or could it be possible when you begin
to develop something like that

681
00:37:49,109 --> 00:37:53,839
I think it's definitely possible com a
lot of work needs to be done so

682
00:37:53,839 --> 00:37:57,089
again in biology we're not working for
first from first principles

683
00:37:57,089 --> 00:38:02,119
in computing we r we made computers we
know exactly with the microcode is every

684
00:38:02,119 --> 00:38:06,140
we build up whereas work predicting down
with bio and so we're not at the point

685
00:38:06,140 --> 00:38:06,839
where we

686
00:38:06,839 --> 00:38:10,160
really know exactly that the first
principles and

687
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:13,630
and I don't know if we ever will on but
that you know to be

688
00:38:13,630 --> 00:38:18,260
actual bioengineering we're going to
have to get down to that level and a

689
00:38:18,260 --> 00:38:22,599
we're not there yet yet so I think maybe
you're talking about the annotated

690
00:38:22,599 --> 00:38:23,980
genomes and

691
00:38:23,980 --> 00:38:27,630
you need to see what price do what
anything in that that exists I'm

692
00:38:27,630 --> 00:38:30,670
it's not a very you know user

693
00:38:30,670 --> 00:38:33,930
friendly people readable kinda thing
letting go to see the icing on the cake

694
00:38:33,930 --> 00:38:34,599
this genome

695
00:38:34,599 --> 00:38:37,890
and initially on sequences I'm butts

696
00:38:37,890 --> 00:38:40,980
you know it needs to be a better
interface hands

697
00:38:40,980 --> 00:38:44,970
know hopefully somebody's gonna do that
in hit and also when

698
00:38:44,970 --> 00:38:48,250
you know when you're writing suffering a
computer and you wanna test your

699
00:38:48,250 --> 00:38:52,040
your code you run it you execute rate
Nico where's

700
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:55,670
if you're testing your biological code
you have to get the DNA synthesized

701
00:38:55,670 --> 00:38:56,140
Scott

702
00:38:56,140 --> 00:38:59,510
which cost money you have to transfixed
the organism which takes time

703
00:38:59,510 --> 00:39:02,890
if the girl the organism which takes
time then you have to be able to look

704
00:39:02,890 --> 00:39:06,839
and characterize to see what's actually
happening so that that the

705
00:39:06,839 --> 00:39:10,290
that iteration process in bio coding

706
00:39:10,290 --> 00:39:13,480
is right now a lot longer then software

707
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:19,450
yes it's a taxiway formal methods is one
of the oldest outfield the computer

708
00:39:19,450 --> 00:39:21,310
science that what you just described so

709
00:39:21,310 --> 00:39:24,359
awesome are great and if the guy

710
00:39:24,359 --> 00:39:27,970
right I'm still love will head to the
lobby or something that'll

711
00:39:27,970 --> 00:39:34,970
was not marked thank you

712
00:40:21,190 --> 00:40:24,700
check check check check

713
00:40:24,700 --> 00:40:28,070
a good evening ladies and gentlemen
these social engineering panel they are

714
00:40:28,070 --> 00:40:29,650
all waiting for will be happening

715
00:40:29,650 --> 00:40:32,910
in just a moment up I want to let you
know that their is

716
00:40:32,910 --> 00:40:37,050
a chip tens concert happening right now
at ten o'clock are probably going on at

717
00:40:37,050 --> 00:40:38,440
eleven o'clock urbanites

718
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:43,440
I am so if you're leaving please go
check that out its gonna be a lot of fun

719
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:47,580
are then also if you are over here if
you're in one of the Isles

720
00:40:47,580 --> 00:40:52,070
in your camping out the security crew is
clearing that out right now you're

721
00:40:52,070 --> 00:40:55,030
years I think you can be all the way up
against the wall are right along the

722
00:40:55,030 --> 00:40:57,280
edge right there but you can be blocking
I always

723
00:40:57,280 --> 00:41:01,190
so please I hope the security crew can
can you get a huge round of applause and

724
00:41:01,190 --> 00:41:03,380
security guys have a really rough job

725
00:41:03,380 --> 00:41:10,380
thank you so much for that so you don't
forget the chiptunes concert tonight

726
00:41:13,120 --> 00:41:15,910
happening right now until probably
around 11 midnight's

727
00:41:15,910 --> 00:41:19,620
and the social engineering panel will be
up in just a few moments

728
00:41:19,620 --> 00:41:26,620
thank you

729
00:41:59,830 --> 00:42:00,120
host
