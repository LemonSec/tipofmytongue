more people speaking about particular
things by this really I i 10

141
00:11:33,199 --> 00:11:37,879
definitely recognize the efforts have a
V in this particular

142
00:11:37,879 --> 00:11:42,749
on conferences been phenomenal by Adam

143
00:11:42,749 --> 00:11:46,019
I love you I'm blown away

144
00:11:46,019 --> 00:11:49,609
just just for you guys accomplished
yesterday

145
00:11:49,609 --> 00:11:52,869
II getting Everest mountain on getting
the connection going

146
00:11:52,869 --> 00:11:56,119
we heard from people at South by
Southwest you're done this that

147
00:11:56,119 --> 00:11:59,299
we did so much better as far as getting
it to work which is

148
00:11:59,299 --> 00:12:02,819
always good to hear arm and of course

149
00:12:02,819 --> 00:12:06,189
there are so many efforts people here to
say a few words about

150
00:12:06,189 --> 00:12:09,779
very things that have gone on are one
other things I really want to

151
00:12:09,779 --> 00:12:13,399
I recognize on is the network itself

152
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:18,100
because the network is something
unprecedented here we had 50 megabit

153
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:21,350
in 2012 and

154
00:12:21,350 --> 00:12:25,389
we weren't sure to a few weeks ago we
you heard about the whole thing with the

155
00:12:25,389 --> 00:12:27,989
distributor we have all kinds of
financial issues and we weren't even

156
00:12:27,989 --> 00:12:28,619
sure

157
00:12:28,619 --> 00:12:32,009
we're going to be able to get the same
net connectivity

158
00:12:32,009 --> 00:12:35,239
we thinking you know having
conversations it's not really about the

159
00:12:35,239 --> 00:12:37,089
network right people can come here in
this

160
00:12:37,089 --> 00:12:40,350
watch the talks at that'll be fine ride
know is gonna complain

161
00:12:40,350 --> 00:12:43,970
and yeah well you know arm

162
00:12:43,970 --> 00:12:47,539
and and just you know when things were
on at their darkest

163
00:12:47,539 --> 00:12:51,379
on Carl here who are set up the network
decided that he was going to

164
00:12:51,379 --> 00:12:55,889
go out and get an even better network
than we had before and that's how we

165
00:12:55,889 --> 00:12:58,689
wound up with the network to 100 times
faster

166
00:12:58,689 --> 00:13:02,569
just when that we thought we couldn't do
it at all and that's the hacker spirits

167
00:13:02,569 --> 00:13:02,970
right

168
00:13:02,970 --> 00:13:09,970
the

169
00:13:12,140 --> 00:13:18,470
this is the guy to thank for this is
highlander he's got some people the

170
00:13:18,470 --> 00:13:21,430
the

171
00:13:21,430 --> 00:13:24,930
either arm

172
00:13:24,930 --> 00:13:28,410
Nike toll lotta really amazing long
stories on

173
00:13:28,410 --> 00:13:31,520
we were kind of up and down I wanted to
do this

174
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:35,900
I am from the start bring in are online
and and

175
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:40,279
we've had a standing offer arm with
hurricane for a while but we've never

176
00:13:40,279 --> 00:13:41,830
been able to make it happen

177
00:13:41,830 --> 00:13:45,740
army and it was getting really close we
had some problems

178
00:13:45,740 --> 00:13:49,480
from getting permission with the hotel
and

179
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:53,220
obviously them the management situations
been changing a lot here lately anyway

180
00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:53,880
I'm

181
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:58,440
fast-forward the contract nothing was
really happening it didn't people

182
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:00,730
weren't talking and we were getting
permission to

183
00:14:00,730 --> 00:14:05,160
do the microwave fast enough and i got
really frustrated with how long it was

184
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:07,480
taking cuz we had like a month ago

185
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:10,560
arm so I I I made a

186
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:15,310
an inquiry to the people are CNN Denmark
I reported back to my network team which

187
00:14:15,310 --> 00:14:15,750
is

188
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:20,110
freaking amazing you're gonna meet I am
pretty much the core guys and a lot of

189
00:14:20,110 --> 00:14:20,360
them

190
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:23,620
in a minute um anyway a.m.

191
00:14:23,620 --> 00:14:26,770
in love dusts discuss in detail exactly
how that went down

192
00:14:26,770 --> 00:14:30,060
I so basically in the last month

193
00:14:30,060 --> 00:14:34,260
we got the right people together and it
was a a really interesting coincidence

194
00:14:34,260 --> 00:14:37,870
love I am certain people getting
involved in getting the right people

195
00:14:37,870 --> 00:14:38,720
talking

196
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:43,720
on I'm really just interested people ask
me so what is your interest in leading

197
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:44,630
the NACA

198
00:14:44,630 --> 00:14:48,900
what is interesting in doing this and I
said wall I'm a hacker am really

199
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:50,990
interested in this stuff and I'm not
really doing this

200
00:14:50,990 --> 00:14:54,140
regularly but I know enough about it and
I'm interested enough to

201
00:14:54,140 --> 00:14:57,730
arm think an ideal I can push it forward
so

202
00:14:57,730 --> 00:15:01,640
that was really my goal but I knew I
needed a lot I'll ton of help

203
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:06,110
to do it arm so the anyway I

204
00:15:06,110 --> 00:15:09,560
I'm not gonna get into it absolutely
like all the details of how those

205
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:11,209
communications when and what it took

206
00:15:11,209 --> 00:15:15,130
so arm cuz I've I think the guys are
gonna let our pretty clearly what we

207
00:15:15,130 --> 00:15:16,110
ended up with

208
00:15:16,110 --> 00:15:20,070
but arm we eventually worked with our
CNN got

209
00:15:20,070 --> 00:15:23,089
patch and and then it was

210
00:15:23,089 --> 00:15:28,020
weeks uncertainty about permission
exactly with the hotel allow us to do

211
00:15:28,020 --> 00:15:34,610
arm anyway I again it's really it took a
long time and I was really uncertain and

212
00:15:34,610 --> 00:15:36,230
frankly scared to death that

213
00:15:36,230 --> 00:15:39,380
I am I was going to disappoint and well
we

214
00:15:39,380 --> 00:15:42,400
we have a whole new scorer in the net in
the NOC

215
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:46,770
and well its it's a whole new team and
about itself was really

216
00:15:46,770 --> 00:15:49,860
odd because I was creating teams have
people that I hadn't met and that

217
00:15:49,860 --> 00:15:51,380
probably had met each other

218
00:15:51,380 --> 00:15:54,410
on so that additionally made it kinda

219
00:15:54,410 --> 00:15:57,690
the really nervous that nerve-wracking
so

220
00:15:57,690 --> 00:16:02,200
I without further ado I'm just gonna
think everybody I could think over the

221
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:05,180
last couple days when in between doing
other stuff and then

222
00:16:05,180 --> 00:16:08,620
I and the rest the story I think we're
going to share with you during our

223
00:16:08,620 --> 00:16:09,459
presentation

224
00:16:09,459 --> 00:16:12,690
so um first off I'd like to thank a
manual for

225
00:16:12,690 --> 00:16:15,890
a believing in me and letting me kinda

226
00:16:15,890 --> 00:16:18,940

227

229
00:16:25,589 --> 00:16:30,280

design sign a surly

231
00:16:34,390 --> 00:16:38,459
network stuff but he was very involved

235
00:16:50,089 --> 00:16:53,810
Twitter and stuff like that and they
actually talked about it and came up

236
00:16:53,810 --> 00:16:54,320
with

237
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:57,760
well what they could do and to that end

238
00:16:57,760 --> 00:17:01,790
attila who you mean a second was able to
communicate with me

a fantastic job

242
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:16,900
from doing a writeup what he done in the
past and we're able to use that as a

243
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:17,560
template

244
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:22,000
and take the good from it and then
improve on what we thought was feasible

245
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,349
arm also policy a

246
00:17:25,350 --> 00:17:28,610

274
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:27,120

275
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:32,210
I and lastly every single one of you who

276
00:19:32,210 --> 00:19:36,779

so thank you

278
00:19:44,649 --> 00:19:48,019
as I said I could go on we can talk
about the future is like how we're gonna

279
00:19:48,019 --> 00:19:50,940
do but I'd really like to relish the
moment and the

280
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:55,440
arm well really thrilled at on the
president we've set

281
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:59,350
because I'm well I think it can only
improve from here

282
00:19:59,350 --> 00:20:02,510
I am really honored to have been able to
lead an

283
00:20:02,510 --> 00:20:05,409
and and have met a lot of new people
that I think ur gonna stick around

284
00:20:05,409 --> 00:20:07,580
especially a and including a provider's

285
00:20:07,580 --> 00:20:12,029
I also like to thank I'll do it on
mental health of a lower

286
00:20:12,029 --> 00:20:16,169
out financially to mandrel big-time
because we eventually got

287
00:20:16,169 --> 00:20:19,600
the cost of patching it and connecting
it pay for

288
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:26,600
so that's pretty cool as it was
essentially free so

289
00:20:29,510 --> 00:20:32,590
the those are all the people I could
think up I know there's a ton more

290
00:20:32,590 --> 00:20:34,690
people I'm really really sorry I just

291
00:20:34,690 --> 00:20:41,690
I'd and a lot I seventy though where
pallets stacked up in the warehouse you

292
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:45,610
know them really busy time you know we
get all the equipment company and it was

293
00:20:45,610 --> 00:20:46,049
really

294
00:20:46,049 --> 00:20:53,049
hey I am I thought we had all these
packages the shut up Louis

295
00:20:53,970 --> 00:20:57,269
arm so

296
00:20:57,269 --> 00:21:00,419
anyway with that I would like to
introduce arm

297
00:21:00,419 --> 00:21:05,899
our current knock team and do a really
cool presentation on what the fuck

298
00:21:05,899 --> 00:21:12,899
actually happen

299
00:21:16,929 --> 00:21:18,830
everybody so

300
00:21:18,830 --> 00:21:22,779
I first gotta say the an intro was
fantastic

301
00:21:22,779 --> 00:21:26,630
covered a lot of the bases I may go
through really quick

302
00:21:26,630 --> 00:21:30,169
just some in the background you know
what exactly we did here

303
00:21:30,169 --> 00:21:33,600
however the paw print and ATM and

304
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:37,360
help you push for Bama cell

305
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:40,380
are start ask how was saying your ass

306
00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:44,039
that he asked the see CCC

307
00:21:44,039 --> 00:21:47,980
rc3 knock a month prior to who if they
could assist with running the network

308
00:21:47,980 --> 00:21:48,950
this year

309
00:21:48,950 --> 00:21:52,700
and a Tele and feiger reached out to
myself

310
00:21:52,700 --> 00:21:56,860
two weeks prior to the conference to get
help with the Korean connected issues

311
00:21:56,860 --> 00:21:57,929
that they're facing

312
00:21:57,929 --> 00:22:03,690
in less than two weeks seven business
days to be exact we managed to get

313
00:22:03,690 --> 00:22:06,960
engage the connected to be established
to the hotel Pennsylvania

314
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:12,460
the so

315
00:22:12,460 --> 00:22:17,370
I I would definitely call that america
I've never seen tokars work so fast

316
00:22:17,370 --> 00:22:20,750
the coordination that

317
00:22:20,750 --> 00:22:24,820
took place an order for that to occur
now we got 10 Diego transport activity

318
00:22:24,820 --> 00:22:25,990
from RCN

319
00:22:25,990 --> 00:22:29,970
to 111 8th Avenue now which is the
Google Data Center

320
00:22:29,970 --> 00:22:33,769
II and Equinix we got across tech
between our CNN

321
00:22:33,769 --> 00:22:36,990
Ichi on we got ten-day transit

322
00:22:36,990 --> 00:22:41,139
sponsored by hurricane electric how we
had to get lol days and from two

323
00:22:41,139 --> 00:22:44,340
different service providers in order to
get the IP space that we needed to run

324
00:22:44,340 --> 00:22:44,909
the network

325
00:22:44,909 --> 00:22:49,429
and we had to get an ipv6 allocation
from hurricane electric special thanks

326
00:22:49,429 --> 00:22:51,929
to reader hurricane and Peter and RCN

327
00:22:51,929 --> 00:22:58,929
for really pulling the strings to make
tokars move quick

328
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:07,320
this is quite possibly the most exciting
piece

329
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:12,020
said this is our very own dark fiber
iight scaleable up to 100 gig in the

330
00:23:12,020 --> 00:23:12,920
future

331
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:19,920
if you can use it had

332
00:23:23,710 --> 00:23:26,710
so the hardware requirements to pull
this off on

333
00:23:26,710 --> 00:23:30,950
our core router and distribution receive
last minute due to sudden sudden change

334
00:23:30,950 --> 00:23:31,840
in requirements

335
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:35,280
and i actually going to 10 gay on such
short notice

336
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:38,900
on literally received the last have a
quick minute the morning before the

337
00:23:38,900 --> 00:23:39,620
conference

338
00:23:39,620 --> 00:23:44,640
I think this is going on forever core
router distribution officer provided by

339
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:46,550
our five yr the wireless controller

340
00:23:46,550 --> 00:23:49,860
optics and access points provided by
Cisco an octal

341
00:23:49,860 --> 00:23:53,550
interns a

342
00:23:53,550 --> 00:23:57,210
r.i.p space we got a slash in action for

343
00:23:57,210 --> 00:24:01,760
from right through Alcoa networks and we
got a slash 23

344
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:05,550
in the air in region from sleeper how we
also got a 48

345
00:24:05,550 --> 00:24:09,410
v6 Allison easter eggs hidden in I think
if you picked up on it

346
00:24:09,410 --> 00:24:12,420
I'm so the hex to ASCII for

347
00:24:12,420 --> 00:24:19,420
uplink interface to hurt game says 2014
hope

348
00:24:24,659 --> 00:24:27,349
an actual allocation as 2608 as well

349
00:24:27,349 --> 00:24:32,269
the network or

350
00:24:32,269 --> 00:24:35,440
I we had a brocade XOM r4000 backbone
router

351
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:40,359
which is capable of up to 960 give its
populated with eighty give

352
00:24:40,359 --> 00:24:44,859
optics are ready for consumption I'm we
turned up five those eight ports this

353
00:24:44,859 --> 00:24:49,099
weekend on the distribution switches on
May as an eighteen were connected it

354
00:24:49,099 --> 00:24:49,759
engage

355
00:24:49,759 --> 00:24:53,460
how the distributions for a chance sex
was unfortunately connected at one gig

356
00:24:53,460 --> 00:24:54,909
because we ran outta hardware

357
00:24:54,909 --> 00:25:01,450
yes

358
00:25:01,450 --> 00:25:05,109
that is Fred yep

359
00:25:05,109 --> 00:25:10,320
cell this was during this node in talk
how we had to put a fan directly next to

360
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:11,019
the core

361
00:25:11,019 --> 00:25:18,019
%ah got a little crazy

362
00:25:22,250 --> 00:25:24,740
this is our distribution up on the
eighteenth floor

363
00:25:24,740 --> 00:25:30,180
some and three three switches appear
added over the network

364
00:25:30,180 --> 00:25:33,420
fire service was

365
00:25:33,420 --> 00:25:37,190
completed on Wednesday night I tell if I
cut myself

366
00:25:37,190 --> 00:25:40,700
are came out and which has seen the
light meter West Show

367
00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:45,660
revolve some silliness on because where
it was delivered was like right in the

368
00:25:45,660 --> 00:25:46,660
middle of a ballroom

369
00:25:46,660 --> 00:25:51,740
and they had an event going on the next
day so we literally had to hide the

370
00:25:51,740 --> 00:25:52,550
fiber

371
00:25:52,550 --> 00:25:57,290
up and the crown molding to go down the
hallway

372
00:25:57,290 --> 00:26:01,330
the rest to the network

373
00:26:01,330 --> 00:26:08,330
I was actually completed in one night

374
00:26:13,190 --> 00:26:16,730
as some pictures /a you know the
equipment that was involved with

375
00:26:16,730 --> 00:26:18,110
actually making this happen

376
00:26:18,110 --> 00:26:23,070
you know how I came in so a couple other
pallets from 2600 warehouse

377
00:26:23,070 --> 00:26:27,300
Louis I

378
00:26:27,300 --> 00:26:31,230
retreat at five all gone

379
00:26:31,230 --> 00:26:36,540
yup all gone and the corn distribution
Raksha delivered

380
00:26:36,540 --> 00:26:41,500
with radiused our on Wednesday when he
did a couple of the hops to help us at

381
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:43,740
the it cost us like fifty dollars just
to get

382
00:26:43,740 --> 00:26:47,330
to our hotel room for the night said
that was fun

383
00:26:47,330 --> 00:26:54,020
that's a actually are tagged for the RCN
circuit actually says ho backs on it

384
00:26:54,020 --> 00:26:54,780
pretty cool

385
00:26:54,780 --> 00:26:58,480
this is fiber dangling from the

386
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:02,730
from the D-mark advertising

387
00:27:02,730 --> 00:27:08,090
activity at

388
00:27:08,090 --> 00:27:12,120
happy up a light meter you can kinda see
the fiber over here this is where

389
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:13,820
initially running down the hallway

390
00:27:13,820 --> 00:27:17,100
and mr. advised that there is an
actually be an event the next day

391
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:20,250
so at the very top there there's some
crown molding

392
00:27:20,250 --> 00:27:23,720
we had to move it further up and
actually liked a bit into their

393
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:27,680
ASO when it was all said and done look
like nothing was there

394
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:31,650
this is a attila picking up the

395
00:27:31,650 --> 00:27:35,280
laps from Cisco this is actually the
morning upset up

396
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:40,230
this is %ah about half have the lapse
that we have

397
00:27:40,230 --> 00:27:44,910
on tele with some

398
00:27:44,910 --> 00:27:51,700
much needed coffee Europe for on 24
hours at this point yeah

399
00:27:51,700 --> 00:27:55,900
copy was not enough action to get some
come out as well it was a rough night

400
00:27:55,900 --> 00:28:01,820
ha need i say more

401
00:28:01,820 --> 00:28:06,140
I think I think there was ethanol
involved as well

402
00:28:06,140 --> 00:28:13,140
maybe some hacer hope

403
00:28:14,460 --> 00:28:17,820
corner all my me

404
00:28:17,820 --> 00:28:20,880
online means on campus are

405
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:24,630
house on their

406
00:28:24,630 --> 00:28:28,700
bunch game I so

407
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:32,020
obviously you know this is a very
interesting hotel from my cable in

408
00:28:32,020 --> 00:28:32,730
perspective

409
00:28:32,730 --> 00:28:36,420
the only pass panels happened to be on
the mezzanine and

410
00:28:36,420 --> 00:28:40,320
that cabinet is locked so we had it has
somewhat pickers open it for us

411
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:47,279
the

412
00:28:47,279 --> 00:28:50,240
so we're able to connect the lobby
mezzanine third

413
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:53,700
46 Moran 84 a thats

414
00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:57,220
never been done before we never had a
connected to the on our network

415
00:28:57,220 --> 00:29:00,830
on the six floor as well so this is a an
expansion as far as

416
00:29:00,830 --> 00:29:07,380
wherein the hotel we had service so
that's X so

417
00:29:07,380 --> 00:29:12,820
we ran in order to make this happen 850
meters a fiber

418
00:29:12,820 --> 00:29:15,840
7,000 feet of copper

419
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:21,289
with another 7,000 a spare and we had a
rerun the collectivity from the

420
00:29:21,289 --> 00:29:23,419
mezzanine to the 84

421
00:29:23,419 --> 00:29:28,700
three times it was even approved by the
Australian Government

422
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:34,019
if you don't believe me ask security I

423
00:29:34,019 --> 00:29:37,340
so

424
00:29:37,340 --> 00:29:42,510
just to put the the amount of fiber in
perspective 850 meters a fiver

425
00:29:42,510 --> 00:29:46,340
is 27 88 be and just how tall

426
00:29:46,340 --> 00:29:53,340
is that

427
00:29:59,349 --> 00:30:02,249
unfortunately last night at 308

428
00:30:02,249 --> 00:30:09,249
a.m. the fiber from the mezzanine 284
was cut maliciously

429
00:30:10,899 --> 00:30:14,919
a handful %uh VANOC team I spent four
hours re running it

430
00:30:14,919 --> 00:30:19,769
unfortunately it wasn't on spend alls so
they literally had to just drag fiber

431
00:30:19,769 --> 00:30:20,350
down the

432
00:30:20,350 --> 00:30:24,710
and a all got caught up I took about two
hours

433
00:30:24,710 --> 00:30:29,480
untangle so that was the third time that
I cable was rerun

434
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:32,549
I believe we that's like a compound
fracture

435
00:30:32,549 --> 00:30:37,909
yep I yeah looks like a key battered
durable

436
00:30:37,909 --> 00:30:41,380
aidid tau so

437
00:30:41,380 --> 00:30:44,980
in terms of wireless access points with
forty-nine access points on site

438
00:30:44,980 --> 00:30:50,059
3400 deployed how we would've played
more but we're looking for hot spots and

439
00:30:50,059 --> 00:30:52,039
you guys in use in a family cell

440
00:30:52,039 --> 00:30:57,149
awesome interesting stats

441
00:30:57,149 --> 00:31:02,200
30 9.5 percent running 15 wifi

442
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:09,200
I don't know what to say to that

443
00:31:12,169 --> 00:31:14,749
42 percent run 2.4 gigahertz

444
00:31:14,749 --> 00:31:18,529
which according to Towers actually
pretty good better than on the sea

445
00:31:18,529 --> 00:31:19,159
cities

446
00:31:19,159 --> 00:31:23,279
if you have device that doesn't sport
fighting by one

447
00:31:23,279 --> 00:31:26,940
might work better on conference

448
00:31:26,940 --> 00:31:31,329
we had 2,785 unique wireless clients

449
00:31:31,329 --> 00:31:35,379
we had Chris triangle actually 10 hope
this year

450
00:31:35,379 --> 00:31:42,119
as did the crime for government to users
found themselves a as awesome

451
00:31:42,119 --> 00:31:45,919
and I we found one fuck not user

452
00:31:45,919 --> 00:31:52,719
but in cash at one time breakdown by
manufactures on the wireless

453
00:31:52,719 --> 00:31:59,719
top 10 user names

454
00:32:00,419 --> 00:32:07,319
by the way you could have used any user
name and password combination cell

455
00:32:07,319 --> 00:32:13,839
users on a network guy with three
thousand an hour or so attendees

456
00:32:13,839 --> 00:32:15,279
speakers exciter a

457
00:32:15,279 --> 00:32:19,059
6,000 921 unique DHCP requests

458
00:32:19,059 --> 00:32:23,729
ass about two times the number users
I'll in the most traffic utilization

459
00:32:23,729 --> 00:32:26,929
occurred as a result that people
actually using the network

460
00:32:26,929 --> 00:32:31,869
during a sit and talk offer streaming
and you can't actually see that on the

461
00:32:31,869 --> 00:32:33,529
grass and you can see that it will

462
00:32:33,529 --> 00:32:37,609
continue sorry about

463
00:32:37,609 --> 00:32:40,899
doubled the amount of traffic we did
posts snowden

464
00:32:40,899 --> 00:32:46,299
talk as a result of that RP

465
00:32:46,299 --> 00:32:50,019
was 1.5 gig out of 10

466
00:32:50,019 --> 00:32:53,099
home

467
00:32:53,099 --> 00:32:57,109
one thing as a we really wanted a lot of
resources I did spoke about the

468
00:32:57,109 --> 00:33:00,609
yeah wanting to expand and grow and I
knew the seriousness of a lot of what

469
00:33:00,609 --> 00:33:01,629
was going on

470
00:33:01,629 --> 00:33:05,419
would make it important to have
resources the way we're doing streaming

471
00:33:05,419 --> 00:33:06,269
the way we're

472
00:33:06,269 --> 00:33:09,999
I'm well basically crowded and needing
to have

473
00:33:09,999 --> 00:33:13,269
simulcast arm well we really would have
been

474
00:33:13,269 --> 00:33:17,119
as successful as we work we hadn't had
the minute we did lot about stream was

475
00:33:17,119 --> 00:33:18,669
coming from the internet

476
00:33:18,669 --> 00:33:22,269
so whose really really useful they had
this

477
00:33:22,269 --> 00:33:26,239
in well you can see their back Cisco

478
00:33:26,239 --> 00:33:31,079
yes this

479
00:33:31,079 --> 00:33:36,109
us yes

480
00:33:36,109 --> 00:33:43,109
the area recover their sir just to give
you an idea of the

481
00:33:43,619 --> 00:33:47,499
the power than our staff and how many
are there were others were watching the

482
00:33:47,499 --> 00:33:48,619
ESN and talk

483
00:33:48,619 --> 00:33:52,169
making sure that stuff was continuing to
operate this is a

484
00:33:52,169 --> 00:33:56,449
a small picture hurricane electric
engineers are on site

485
00:33:56,449 --> 00:34:00,379
during the live stream to ensure that
nothing was interrupted again

486
00:34:00,379 --> 00:34:07,379
thanks to read and his crew

487
00:34:11,510 --> 00:34:13,819
whatever last-minute knock projects was
a

488
00:34:13,819 --> 00:34:17,639
bandwidth utilization meter which you
might have seen in the mezzanine level

489
00:34:17,639 --> 00:34:21,470
this is it when I was actually spiking
and into the red sprinkle

490
00:34:21,470 --> 00:34:25,909
service designed to promote the push
more band with campaign that we're

491
00:34:25,909 --> 00:34:26,970
trying to put out there

492
00:34:26,970 --> 00:34:30,760
if you didn't see it on created by
berries and now

493
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:34,750
yep

494
00:34:34,750 --> 00:34:38,539
it was a point to take as actually tied
into our network

495
00:34:38,539 --> 00:34:44,159
network monitoring system says the
matrices cases that we saw

496
00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:51,159
on your ringer almost like we're port
scanning the entire Internet %uh

497
00:34:52,379 --> 00:34:58,579
its

498
00:34:58,579 --> 00:35:03,940
so we actually had choose different
pieces of Erskine in the Internet

499
00:35:03,940 --> 00:35:08,109
from two different IP space is pretty
cool because we actually had you know

500
00:35:08,109 --> 00:35:12,660
another one psyches we also had US
psyches and so they're actually split

501
00:35:12,660 --> 00:35:16,160
across the two on said the interesting
to see what they did the difference and

502
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:17,150
the result is

503
00:35:17,150 --> 00:35:21,630
on trace routing and unique paths

504
00:35:21,630 --> 00:35:26,190
to various and points on the Internet
honeypots and we actually had someone

505
00:35:26,190 --> 00:35:29,359
reach out to us on Twitter and ask if
they could put a server in with a 10-day

506
00:35:29,359 --> 00:35:32,420
coupling we actually get my feet
directly to the core

507
00:35:32,420 --> 00:35:37,789
for the next Oct you can actually host
servers with us

508
00:35:37,789 --> 00:35:42,440
says some observations

509
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:46,170
at a security conference attendees fail
to realize that they're on public IP

510
00:35:46,170 --> 00:35:46,910
addresses

511
00:35:46,910 --> 00:35:52,890
every girl in the ass as why no nap for
you

512
00:35:52,890 --> 00:35:58,319
it doesn't scare I even with signs up to
promote the use more band with

513
00:35:58,319 --> 00:36:00,890
initiative failed to saturate the
network

514
00:36:00,890 --> 00:36:04,539
in fact the peak usage was only 15
percent of the capacity

515
00:36:04,539 --> 00:36:11,539
but attila won his best nikad from radio
seller bet fifty dollars that we

516
00:36:11,619 --> 00:36:13,559
wouldn't miss more than 700 mag

517
00:36:13,559 --> 00:36:20,559
we have 1.5 gay the week

00:41:07,990 --> 00:41:11,720
currently one most %uh prominent people
in phnom

581
00:41:11,720 --> 00:41:16,560
the shield activism everything I ever
snowed and up because

582
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:20,130
obviously he can step back the country
we had to do a rolling

583
00:41:20,130 --> 00:41:23,400
it done South by Southwest but there'd
been a lot of

584
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:26,540
well issues %uh so

585
00:41:26,540 --> 00:41:29,790
we wanted to make sure that for are that

586
00:41:29,790 --> 00:41:34,190
when we had to people who are absolutely
credible in this area and its field

587
00:41:34,190 --> 00:41:37,840
everything we go without a hitch and
thankfully as bill now

588
00:41:37,840 --> 00:41:41,820
it that said

589
00:41:41,820 --> 00:41:45,170
in it was not that easy there was a
significant amount of planning

590
00:41:45,170 --> 00:41:48,940
I step one was to

591
00:41:48,940 --> 00:41:55,940
not use seven proxies you can move me
all you want but

592
00:41:57,100 --> 00:42:00,620
has been I we also went through we were
planning cuz

593
00:42:00,620 --> 00:42:03,620
as we all no you know things go wrong

594
00:42:03,620 --> 00:42:08,170
and sometimes it's not a bad thing but
when we have the keynote speaker and

595
00:42:08,170 --> 00:42:11,540
conversation with someone who is going
to get watch from around the world

596
00:42:11,540 --> 00:42:16,500
we don't want stuff to just not work so
we had multiple things I we actually

597
00:42:16,500 --> 00:42:19,860
had %uh several fallback involving um
calling him

598
00:42:19,860 --> 00:42:23,390
in russia and having a phone reason for
my back that sources for social

599
00:42:23,390 --> 00:42:23,970
engineering

600
00:42:23,970 --> 00:42:27,520
I we had another fall back which
involved having someone set up on stage

601
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:28,460
with a laptop

602
00:42:28,460 --> 00:42:32,880
and %ah type messages back and forth
with them have someone read and type was

603
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:34,330
ever being said by Alistair

604
00:42:34,330 --> 00:42:38,150
and the absolute absolute last I'll
follow back

605
00:42:38,150 --> 00:42:41,150
was that we would by any means necessary

606
00:42:41,150 --> 00:42:44,720
user anything from text messaging to
secure messaging to

607
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:48,210
whatever we could make work at the last
minute so on

608
00:42:48,210 --> 00:42:52,950
we actually one abusing Google Hangouts
to the entire thing

609
00:42:52,950 --> 00:42:55,980
gay Google

610
00:42:55,980 --> 00:42:59,480
although

611
00:42:59,480 --> 00:43:02,920
anybody from Google used to clear that
works Google hangout

612
00:43:02,920 --> 00:43:06,190
if you could make it so I can you things
like

613
00:43:06,190 --> 00:43:09,220
on chat messages that happen in the
background I'm so in love you for that

614
00:43:09,220 --> 00:43:09,610
little

615
00:43:09,610 --> 00:43:13,350
but in during the chat we have to send a
message and

616
00:43:13,350 --> 00:43:17,340
yes we do some like that and also if we
could make it so we can currently hide

617
00:43:17,340 --> 00:43:18,580
the friggin icons

618
00:43:18,580 --> 00:43:24,080
because anytime we move the mouse they
would come up on screen I we use Google

619
00:43:24,080 --> 00:43:25,160
Hangouts a chat with him

620
00:43:25,160 --> 00:43:28,450
and I we kicked a little early and it
was

621
00:43:28,450 --> 00:43:31,520
actually pretty amazing how well it
worked

622
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:35,640
arm this time my we have much people
here will watch to talk it up myself

623
00:43:35,640 --> 00:43:37,340
lesser there at South by Southwest

624
00:43:37,340 --> 00:43:41,080
and one other complaints we heard was
that Tom when last time he added a

625
00:43:41,080 --> 00:43:41,920
remote session

626
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:45,660
it was less a video and more arm I'm
gonna quote actually

627
00:43:45,660 --> 00:43:49,890
may cheer a series of still images
stuttering together

628
00:43:49,890 --> 00:43:53,910
this time we were able to pull off
without a hitch

629
00:43:53,910 --> 00:43:56,920
and with our first plan actually worked
in phnom

630
00:43:56,920 --> 00:44:00,470
as couple people in particular need to
be thanks for that on a manual

631
00:44:00,470 --> 00:44:03,650
for working to set it all up Kyle

632
00:44:03,650 --> 00:44:08,430
great for making sure more than ever
before the conference

633
00:44:08,430 --> 00:44:12,180
are eighty folks who managed to

634
00:44:12,180 --> 00:44:15,740
I will say we had a whole bunch stuff
wired together

635
00:44:15,740 --> 00:44:19,370
I'm sorry folks were actually partnering
up the last minute

636
00:44:19,370 --> 00:44:23,420
and make sure he worked which was a
little interesting we actually had a

637
00:44:23,420 --> 00:44:26,690
3 a MacBook Pros running back there so
it looks a little like an Apple store

638
00:44:26,690 --> 00:44:27,300
but

639
00:44:27,300 --> 00:44:31,890
it works I can complain in I will way we
were pulling it was actually the same

640
00:44:31,890 --> 00:44:34,100
we're doing right now we put him asleep
or

641
00:44:34,100 --> 00:44:38,140
use VGA we also learned another little
inch the buckle hangouts for

642
00:44:38,140 --> 00:44:42,050
the Google people here on can you please
make it so that when I plug into USB

643
00:44:42,050 --> 00:44:43,140
sound device

644
00:44:43,140 --> 00:44:47,330
you can send and receive audio too at
the same time we r

645
00:44:47,330 --> 00:44:50,390
discovered the hard way that Google
Hangouts does not like that so we had

646
00:44:50,390 --> 00:44:51,180
used to

647
00:44:51,180 --> 00:44:54,960
USB audio devices a professional USB
audio interface is

648
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:58,770
to a centers the audio arm

649
00:44:58,770 --> 00:45:02,740
the stone talk was important for us and
we knew that there are a lot of people

650
00:45:02,740 --> 00:45:04,400
who were here that want to watch it

651
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:09,360
as such in we did remote streaming this
time

652
00:45:09,360 --> 00:45:12,920
and I'm gonna talk a little bit about
how we did now I'm gonna bring up the

653
00:45:12,920 --> 00:45:14,430
folks from Internet Society

654
00:45:14,430 --> 00:45:17,840
who handle the entire thing for us this
time

655
00:45:17,840 --> 00:45:21,080
in act

656
00:45:21,080 --> 00:45:26,590
time was just the plasma

657
00:45:26,590 --> 00:45:29,650
so this Mac

658
00:45:29,650 --> 00:45:33,870
Alan site for him

659
00:45:33,870 --> 00:45:36,980

662
00:45:45,090 --> 00:45:49,660
%ah there's a banana

663
00:45:49,660 --> 00:45:56,660
I

664
00:45:58,039 --> 00:46:01,190
a

665
00:46:01,190 --> 00:46:03,930
iPod as actual the first presentation
doing this so %uh

666
00:46:03,930 --> 00:46:08,440
metal for not really preparing a man's
in

667
00:46:08,440 --> 00:46:15,440
II

668
00:46:15,930 --> 00:46:21,470
now go this map here

669
00:46:21,470 --> 00:46:24,650
is

670
00:46:24,650 --> 00:46:28,900
where we were streaming to any country
that is not in white

671
00:46:28,900 --> 00:46:35,900
was watching the whole conference
remotely the

672
00:46:42,460 --> 00:46:43,410
on

673
00:46:43,410 --> 00:46:46,880
work we're actually trying to see if
other somebody who news on working in

674
00:46:46,880 --> 00:46:49,320
our cover transit would get all seven
continents but I am

675
00:46:49,320 --> 00:46:52,960
unfortunately we're in the region that
said we were

676
00:46:52,960 --> 00:46:56,630
six countries charges about $600 from
getting all UHV

677
00:46:56,630 --> 00:47:00,730
Asia Middle East and I'm oceana we had

678
00:47:00,730 --> 00:47:03,710
people watching in every country in
Europe we're people watching every

679
00:47:03,710 --> 00:47:04,830
country in North America

680
00:47:04,830 --> 00:47:08,090
from the majority of south america and
from parts of Africa

681
00:47:08,090 --> 00:47:11,120
all the six major continents

682
00:47:11,120 --> 00:47:15,920
were watching this talk and we're
watching this conference the

683
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:22,920
the

684
00:47:23,900 --> 00:47:26,940
these are analytics just from the
embedded Web players

685
00:47:26,940 --> 00:47:31,150
just in the bed where players and we
know for a fact a lot people are also

686
00:47:31,150 --> 00:47:32,200
watching live stream

687
00:47:32,200 --> 00:47:35,770
and we also know that there are several
organizations nearing our streams that

688
00:47:35,770 --> 00:47:36,810
other people watching

689
00:47:36,810 --> 00:47:41,339
just on the embedded web page we had
over 15

690
00:47:41,339 --> 00:47:46,609
thousand unique viewers if you combine
that with the another 1100 from radio

691
00:47:46,609 --> 00:47:48,470
Saleh listen to the audio only feed

692
00:47:48,470 --> 00:47:52,530
to the viewers on livestream that alone
brings us to significantly over

693
00:47:52,530 --> 00:47:59,530
20 thousand people watching this
conference

694
00:48:03,470 --> 00:48:07,500
yet people watching from over 140
countries

695
00:48:07,500 --> 00:48:10,930
this is

696
00:48:10,930 --> 00:48:14,920
significantly more than most other
conferences can ever claim

697
00:48:14,920 --> 00:48:21,920
so thankfully was for up to I would take
one second

701
00:48:35,180 --> 00:48:39,010

711
00:49:13,410 --> 00:49:15,070
inner-city global organization

712
00:49:15,070 --> 00:49:18,290
but if you don't know about them we were
set up twenty two years ago I couple

713
00:49:18,290 --> 00:49:19,050

named Bob Kahn and then serve who did
something to really specially created

715
00:49:22,980 --> 00:49:24,020
the internet so

716
00:49:24,020 --> 00:49:29,100
come we were set up by them to continue
to make the internet better

717

we do many things to make the internet
better around the world look for a

718

to do it again this is great stuff so

723

01:01:46,410 --> 01:01:49,460
I think Lindsay deserves more applause
and matching made this whole

900
01:01:49,460 --> 01:01:56,460
the most everything we do here is
impossible just want you guys to know

901
01:02:04,119 --> 01:02:04,760
that money

902
01:02:04,760 --> 01:02:08,150
having a conference in the middle
midtown Manhattan with much a computer

903
01:02:08,150 --> 01:02:08,839
hackers

904
01:02:08,839 --> 01:02:13,150
and this is an half a million dollar
show as far as I'm concerned as far as

905
01:02:13,150 --> 01:02:14,500
the effort put into it and

906
01:02:14,500 --> 01:02:18,349
and the professionalism it's a it's
something credible and we do with

907
01:02:18,349 --> 01:02:19,500
volunteer effort is

908
01:02:19,500 --> 01:02:23,260
and that's what makes it possible causes
no way that way on C conferences like

909
01:02:23,260 --> 01:02:24,170
this very often

910

the same time of course you know I was

915
01:02:42,590 --> 01:02:43,880
on a video screen so

916
01:02:43,880 --> 01:02:46,950
didn't really matter where you are
watching it it's gonna look the same

917
01:02:46,950 --> 01:02:50,470
and I we just had to ask you to be
patient and we were dealing with fire

918
01:02:50,470 --> 01:02:54,490
marshals in building inspectors and
things like that coulda gone very badly

919
01:02:54,490 --> 01:02:55,410
if people

920
01:02:55,410 --> 01:03:00,619

922
01:03:01,700 --> 01:03:05,630
have seen it before in our conference is
icing people behave really much early

923
01:03:05,630 --> 01:03:07,590

I will tell you this with

949
01:04:57,950 --> 01:05:02,010
we've we've had to deal with all kinds
craziness in this hotel

950
01:05:02,010 --> 01:05:05,740
we've had to deal with the booker's

951
01:05:05,740 --> 01:05:08,940
yeah okay yet there's yeah wrong number
one

952
01:05:08,940 --> 01:05:13,119
well rule number two yeah rule number
two no hookers and that was because

953
01:05:13,119 --> 01:05:18,060
a couple love cons ago and somebody
decided to save a couple of the street

954
01:05:18,060 --> 01:05:18,400
in

955
01:05:18,400 --> 01:05:24,250
it's a long story yeah I will tell you
this

956
01:05:24,250 --> 01:05:28,050
rose 12 yeah 0

957
01:05:28,050 --> 01:05:34,349
so I back to the talk about security

958
01:05:34,349 --> 01:05:38,079
I we had

959
01:05:38,079 --> 01:05:42,579
this conference we had probably where
the more challenging deals with

960
01:05:42,579 --> 01:05:46,220
arm absolutely new staff here in the
hotel

961
01:05:46,220 --> 01:05:49,300
go figure cover couple years we have to
deal with new people

962
01:05:49,300 --> 01:05:53,940
having dealt with this before which they
see a hacker's conference and then just

963
01:05:53,940 --> 01:05:54,410
go

964
01:05:54,410 --> 01:05:58,010
my we head

965
01:05:58,010 --> 01:06:01,859
to building inspectors the fire marshal

966
01:06:01,859 --> 01:06:06,560
we had to rearrange everything on the
floor the came down there they said

967
01:06:06,560 --> 01:06:09,950
new this is not like it is on these
paperwork

968
01:06:09,950 --> 01:06:14,609
and reduce paperwork was from I think
three revisions ago and everybody else

969
01:06:14,609 --> 01:06:15,230
panicked

970
01:06:15,230 --> 01:06:18,569
so we got everything set up taken down
moved

971
01:06:18,569 --> 01:06:23,140
and they signed off on it and then they
said the fire marshal be coming by

972
01:06:23,140 --> 01:06:28,030
we lived in fear that for the whole
weekend because thank you new york city

973
01:06:28,030 --> 01:06:32,750
for changing the fire code and requiring
us to have even more staff

974
01:06:32,750 --> 01:06:36,500
brought in at the last minute arm does
anybody know who those

975
01:06:36,500 --> 01:06:41,180
staff the company we got tiger was tires

976
01:06:41,180 --> 01:06:45,630
i think is tighter security supplied us
with the with the fire watch folks that

977
01:06:45,630 --> 01:06:46,270
campus

978
01:06:46,270 --> 01:06:49,359
in check in OK with the fire marshal so

979
01:06:49,359 --> 01:06:52,359
pocket knife yeah Thursday night they
provide

980
01:06:52,359 --> 01:06:56,030

amicus brief he was an unprecedented
year for registration

1089
01:15:10,820 --> 01:15:14,510
we had over 2000 pre-registered
attendees this year

1090
01:15:14,510 --> 01:15:18,130
as well as the hundreds of people who
came and bought tickets at the door

1091
01:15:18,130 --> 01:15:22,450
I am I've been told the back in 1994

1092
01:15:22,450 --> 01:15:25,790
it could take 15 minutes to check
somebody into the conference

1093
01:15:25,790 --> 01:15:29,490
and at our peak on Friday morning we're
doing on average by

1094
01:15:29,490 --> 01:15:34,550
one check in every 10 seconds so I'm I
hope that made it easy for you guys to

1095
01:15:34,550 --> 01:15:36,220
get in and get where you want to go

but thanks very much for them arm

1121
01:17:09,280 --> 01:17:13,320
a little ceremony that we want to engage
in right now that's

1122
01:17:13,320 --> 01:17:16,789
the computer over there that you've all
been admiring that

1123
01:17:16,789 --> 01:17:19,939
is our z100's are

1124
01:17:19,939 --> 01:17:26,539
if kids in a tizzy 100 that we purchase
back in 1984 and that was the 2600

1125
01:17:26,539 --> 01:17:30,499
mean machine I was like we entered
descriptions on that I'll

1126
01:17:30,499 --> 01:17:34,189
we didn't do any hacking from there are
with this basically did all kinds

1127
01:17:34,189 --> 01:17:34,999
illegals

1128
01:17:34,999 --> 01:17:39,130
things on that machine I when we first
got it had two floppy disks you have a

1129
01:17:39,130 --> 01:17:42,900
quarter-inch floppy disks and then now
we replaced one of them with a forty

1130
01:17:42,900 --> 01:17:43,989
make hard drive

1131
01:17:43,989 --> 01:17:48,619
which was huge back them on how could
you show the folks are there's a it's

1132
01:17:48,619 --> 01:17:49,939
very heavy so

1133
01:17:49,939 --> 01:17:53,320
you need somebody started to pick it up
on the side are

1134
01:17:53,320 --> 01:17:56,639
yes there's a nice Bell System sticker
that we got

1135
01:17:56,639 --> 01:18:01,019
and on the back or the Sun it's got a
great keyboard chip

1136
01:18:01,019 --> 01:18:04,340
I'm on the back I all these that way
s-100

1137
01:18:04,340 --> 01:18:08,659
the slots and that we never used it was
really cool computer as loud sounds like

1138
01:18:08,659 --> 01:18:10,130
an airplane landing when you turn on

1139
01:18:10,130 --> 01:18:14,280
unfortunately can really turn on now I
we made a mistake of leaving it

1140
01:18:14,280 --> 01:18:18,479
in phnom in a garage for a few years and
I'm

1141
01:18:18,479 --> 01:18:21,769
well as interesting because you know how
computers have have

1142
01:18:21,769 --> 01:18:27,709
mice this computer had a real mouse that
decided to live inside it and shoot up

1143
01:18:27,709 --> 01:18:28,860
all kinds of things

1144
01:18:28,860 --> 01:18:33,489
on so we basically we were talking about
this on the radio

1145
01:18:33,489 --> 01:18:37,539
a few months ago talking about how we'd
love them restore this machine get it

1146
01:18:37,539 --> 01:18:39,150
working again the find out what's

1147
01:18:39,150 --> 01:18:44,659
on the hard drive arm and we are we got
a call from our friends over at March a

1148
01:18:44,659 --> 01:18:46,539
summit mid-atlantic pressure computer

1149
01:18:46,539 --> 01:18:50,579
computer hobbyists I think I got it
right and these guys

1150
01:18:50,579 --> 01:18:54,519
is awesome guys are going to take this
computer and restore it for us

1151
01:18:54,519 --> 01:19:01,519
and and we have somebody from march
right here who's going to say couple

1152
01:19:03,570 --> 01:19:05,139
words about the organization then

1153
01:19:05,139 --> 01:19:09,039
I i i'd like for people to treat machine
with some respect we're gonna have a

1154
01:19:09,039 --> 01:19:09,929
procession

1155
01:19:09,929 --> 01:19:13,510
down the aisle figure just it's given so
much service so search

1156
01:19:13,510 --> 01:19:16,800
a polite applause would be appropriate I
think and then will conclude everything

1157
01:19:16,800 --> 01:19:17,369
after that

1158
01:19:17,369 --> 01:19:24,369
