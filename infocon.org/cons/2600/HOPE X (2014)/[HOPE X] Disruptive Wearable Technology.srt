1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,030
technology a slur out about a all about
it from Becky

2
00:00:03,030 --> 00:00:10,030
stern when you see me

3
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:16,029
I can't really see you make thanks to
see you

4
00:00:16,029 --> 00:00:19,869
shut my talk still allowing for
questions at the end

5
00:00:19,869 --> 00:00:23,820
and hi everybody if you don't know me am
my name Victor

6
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:27,380
I'm the director wearable electronic
that a different industry a DIY

7
00:00:27,380 --> 00:00:28,939
electronic company

8
00:00:28,939 --> 00:00:32,930
here in New York City second and we make
Partner

9
00:00:32,930 --> 00:00:36,690
sensory how to tutorials and source code
for makers attackers to build their own

10
00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:40,360
technology and not the stuff they
already have my passion and

11
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:44,579
combining Electronics Inc wraps act to
make an expected useful

12
00:00:44,579 --> 00:00:48,460
expressive and and mister this wearable
electronics

13
00:00:48,460 --> 00:00:55,460
you get there but in addition to making
the electronics industry introducing

14
00:00:56,680 --> 00:00:58,879
fashion and the hacking tool for culture

15
00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:02,480
and this is a predicate volunteer on
Caldwell suits where

16
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:06,140
we you know we've got a whole bunch have
donated business suits for men and women

17
00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:09,510
to Z Kai Park for the Occupy Wall Street
protesters in the offered

18
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:13,240
a haircut and I am a change in booth to
land

19
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:17,009
you know transform their look so that
their appearance may be more palatable

20
00:01:17,009 --> 00:01:18,030
to those

21
00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:21,500
they wish to affect as other message to
be more likely to be heard

22
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:25,119
and there's me as me down in the corner
there at that time at the Pan hemming

23
00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:29,909
coming stage thought to meet the
definition of

24
00:01:29,909 --> 00:01:33,460
up disruptive wearable technology is the
application of science that

25
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:36,670
that disturbs are interruption activity
I'm not soaked

26
00:01:36,670 --> 00:01:39,829
not so much talking about the definition
disruptive that means like

27
00:01:39,829 --> 00:01:40,700
groundbreaking

28
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:44,670
and or innovative because obviously
messaging already do that the one thing

29
00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:45,409
interrupts

30
00:01:45,409 --> 00:01:49,649
am or register they can I

31
00:01:49,649 --> 00:01:52,990
you know disruptive wearable tech can
solve some problems up

32
00:01:52,990 --> 00:01:56,649
you know probably by creating some
problems if you took the subway here

33
00:01:56,649 --> 00:02:00,979
maybe something like this could have
helped you and the the project thingy to

34
00:02:00,979 --> 00:02:03,530
share with you today cover like the last
10 years

35
00:02:03,530 --> 00:02:07,579
have and the creative use of technology
that impact culture

36
00:02:07,579 --> 00:02:11,340
and things that you wear on your person
this is the creative misuse

37
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:14,629
up some anti bird technology from the
garden store am

38
00:02:14,629 --> 00:02:18,060
implemented by a.m. a student in
Singapore name steaming

39
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:23,890
chain I think that we're both have the
potential to inspire us protect us

40
00:02:23,890 --> 00:02:25,440
express ourselves and give us

41
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:29,030
real life super powers and a lot of that
at

42
00:02:29,030 --> 00:02:32,580
packing the body culture comes from our
favorite place MIT

43
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:36,530
I'm a carey ft man with you know some
people call him

44
00:02:36,530 --> 00:02:39,760
whether you agree with it or not the
grandfather Google glass Leah be clean

45
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:41,550
the inventor the lily pad entry now

46
00:02:41,550 --> 00:02:44,840
I have the deer founder little bit and
my boss lamar freed

47
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:49,050
who you know in her spare time like to
make something jammers there's other

48
00:02:49,050 --> 00:02:51,150
places a lot academic places I think the
main

49
00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:55,030
the main place autos culture comes from
is is an MIT and why use

50
00:02:55,030 --> 00:02:58,319
interactive telecommunications program
lately when I like the ResLife think

51
00:02:58,319 --> 00:02:59,620
about it a lot represented their

52
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:04,250
and until Tuesday write an essay about a
project

53
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:08,510
need more or less in chronological order
look at ticket back to 2005 from the old

54
00:03:08,510 --> 00:03:09,849
afro Tek mob site

55
00:03:09,849 --> 00:03:14,519
raise your hand here and and and and if
it's this from archived at orcas the

56
00:03:14,519 --> 00:03:16,069
thanks a lot different now develops

57
00:03:16,069 --> 00:03:21,610
issues they have and ion generator in
this whole issue and it helps you build

58
00:03:21,610 --> 00:03:22,260
up a static

59
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:27,780
charge so that you can suck people by
touching them and they're not very

60
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:30,510
we're gonna go through lengthy maybe
things get a little bit more fashionable

61
00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:32,769
and I'll talk about fashion at the end
a.m.

62
00:03:32,769 --> 00:03:36,409
at these are definitely a mischievous
straighten their

63
00:03:36,409 --> 00:03:41,230
their useful to give you that superpower
Lake the kitchen is hard to get these

64
00:03:41,230 --> 00:03:41,879
parts I

65
00:03:41,879 --> 00:03:45,750
eventually tried to get the antacid
that's one reason you can't on this

66
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:46,930
project yourself right now

67
00:03:46,930 --> 00:03:52,510
but it is a how-to guide this is random
search by I have a deer turkeys

68
00:03:52,510 --> 00:03:57,849
for MIT and its at undergarment that
records the location in pressure at the

69
00:03:57,849 --> 00:04:00,379
way your test during a secondary
screening at the airport

70
00:04:00,379 --> 00:04:07,159
and I'm chichi lot of research to make
this garment and undetectable by

71
00:04:07,159 --> 00:04:10,709
X-ray so that she can wear through the
airport and not gonna not be secondarily

72
00:04:10,709 --> 00:04:12,750
screen because of the project but rather

73
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:17,400
and says she is damn some disconnect
velcro up there and then these are the

74
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:19,090
fabric sensors that have

75
00:04:19,090 --> 00:04:22,479
she detests their Helena media up

76
00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:29,169
ok teather so you know I can and the
Middle Eastern women she felt extra

77
00:04:29,169 --> 00:04:29,889
targeted

78
00:04:29,889 --> 00:04:35,009
and and powerless at to you know
complainant FS someone to share her

79
00:04:35,009 --> 00:04:36,440
feelings she was secondary screen

80
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:40,639
you know all the time and so the this
garment get for the power to extract

81
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:41,919
that misconduct

82
00:04:41,919 --> 00:04:45,669
so you'll see that the theme going
through that we have wearable

83
00:04:45,669 --> 00:04:48,740
electronics and technology can make us
feel powerful

84
00:04:48,740 --> 00:04:51,910
here she is proving that it doesn't go
off in a metal detector

85
00:04:51,910 --> 00:04:56,440
as

86
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:59,979
so this is them this is one of two
credit for my own Erica and a minister

87
00:04:59,979 --> 00:05:01,240
resigned to my fighter

88
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:03,699
this is the laptop talking about the
fact maybe you've seen it before and you

89
00:05:03,699 --> 00:05:04,699
didn't know I made it

90
00:05:04,699 --> 00:05:08,650
ok stop any definite it with my own two
knitting needles

91
00:05:08,650 --> 00:05:12,940
am and major I made a at the sculpture
and art piece I was in grad school

92
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:17,539
and and I wanted to start a family
highlight attention space that you have

93
00:05:17,539 --> 00:05:19,759
when using the computer like nothing
else matters

94
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:24,919
and am but the funding artist that the
meaning it's whatever the viewer to

95
00:05:24,919 --> 00:05:25,750
fight today's

96
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:28,919
right and I'm and big into that I can
whatever your interpretation are

97
00:05:28,919 --> 00:05:30,050
typically not get are

98
00:05:30,050 --> 00:05:33,660
even easier its whatever you think it's
about and it's the hardest job to turn

99
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:34,199
it like

100
00:05:34,199 --> 00:05:38,780
raise questions that make you get gears
moving ahead

101
00:05:38,780 --> 00:05:42,050
and that means that wanted out there in
the world on the Internet bike

102
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:45,370
commentary happened to you know like I
didn't think it was for R&B

103
00:05:45,370 --> 00:05:50,169
I get against the threats for

104
00:05:50,169 --> 00:05:53,729
they really when they made it am a I
wanted to my fingers are cold and I'm

105
00:05:53,729 --> 00:05:56,630
taping and I wanted to make a keyword
cozy and then I just like couldn't stop

106
00:05:56,630 --> 00:05:59,710
meeting

107
00:05:59,710 --> 00:06:02,940
and I read an article actually that ever
telling you something like this

108
00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:06,280
like a big bed legallais coverage
computer can you can see typing or like

109
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:07,520
what's on your screen

110
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:11,060
this is Matt male grooming such a good
sport on our we took a check to Maker

111
00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:11,539
Faire

112
00:06:11,539 --> 00:06:16,800
model for me on the airplane

113
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:20,930
the next project is the I writer if I am
members are free art and technology are

114
00:06:20,930 --> 00:06:22,160
fat and also member

115
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:26,169
that group but I didn't work on this
project doesn't catch my yeah

116
00:06:26,169 --> 00:06:30,770
and if the I writer in a pair I tacking
classes that let this

117
00:06:30,770 --> 00:06:34,669
paralyzed graffiti artists jog and and
and

118
00:06:34,669 --> 00:06:38,490
expanding its really powerful it's made
with the aisle i text low-cost

119
00:06:38,490 --> 00:06:41,720
stupid camera IR LED's cheap plastic
glasses

120
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:45,900
and and I am gonna be about that

121
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:49,039
no I didn't bring sound bring tell them
anything

122
00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:54,140
this is the case definite sound
cassettes music you can hear

123
00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:57,070
it just means it's just economic it's a
music

124
00:06:57,070 --> 00:07:04,070
thank you

125
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:03,130
OKC get it right so what they did then
is a.m.

126
00:08:03,130 --> 00:08:06,290
it took his his drawings and made two
giant projector to

127
00:08:06,290 --> 00:08:10,450
like live project he is trying on see
the building and then

128
00:08:10,450 --> 00:08:14,220
they had like it video chat going back
to his hospital room so he could see

129
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:18,610
his tag still up on a building for the
first time since he was diagnosed with

130
00:08:18,610 --> 00:08:22,180
isnt an became paralyzed by

131
00:08:22,180 --> 00:08:26,260
his dad ALS Lou Gehrig's disease so i
think thats that

132
00:08:26,260 --> 00:08:30,230
super powerful rate it has a this this
wearable these low-cost

133
00:08:30,230 --> 00:08:34,279
DIY tutorial eyes wearable technology
has the power to you

134
00:08:34,279 --> 00:08:37,580
improve the quality of life as we all
live longer and

135
00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:40,830
and our physical bodies fail us and and

136
00:08:40,830 --> 00:08:44,870
that had to die makes it so that anybody
can packer extender

137
00:08:44,870 --> 00:08:51,870
use this for their own purpose this is
the second time I on project Alyssa

138
00:08:52,290 --> 00:08:52,860
sci-fi

139
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:56,029
and and it's the TV B Gone jacket sale

140
00:08:56,029 --> 00:08:59,550
and many of you guys coming out with the
TV danni is it that and

141
00:08:59,550 --> 00:09:03,920
at smaller China device that turns off
all of the television this just a simple

142
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:05,660
infrared remote was invented by

143
00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:08,930
it's all in his here downstairs teaching
an Arduino workshop right now

144
00:09:08,930 --> 00:09:12,800
and you know he teaches all over the
world and then

145
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:15,810
also the kid with co made by my awesome
are free

146
00:09:15,810 --> 00:09:18,870
San Fran and that

147
00:09:18,870 --> 00:09:21,880
the kid and you put it together it's a
little hand-held remote right and I

148
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:23,850
would bring as a grad school in Arizona
and

149
00:09:23,850 --> 00:09:27,510
there it even every restaurant and I
don't just mean like just such a mess at

150
00:09:27,510 --> 00:09:28,560
every rest on

151
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:31,880
and I'm not talking to you is at a
sports bar but you know I got

152
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:36,260
eaten imparted by pixels and and like
make it look at ETF channel focusing on

153
00:09:36,260 --> 00:09:37,500
his with me if there's like

154
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:41,630
and that screen in the room so and I
would turn it off all time that like the

155
00:09:41,630 --> 00:09:43,010
week catholic when he doing

156
00:09:43,010 --> 00:09:46,230
and they see the TV turn off and turn it
back on or that afternoon tea

157
00:09:46,230 --> 00:09:49,280
there actually never happen ever got
kicked out for TV be gone in but

158
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:53,820
and I wanna make it we're still planning
on having cochran interaction

159
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:56,920
and you know if I like people were is
there watching it so if if I could get

160
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:58,089
it to the of they wouldn't

161
00:09:58,089 --> 00:10:02,709
notice it was off until after after I
left so I thought into the appellant my

162
00:10:02,709 --> 00:10:03,650
sweatshirt

163
00:10:03,650 --> 00:10:07,500
and had the infrared LED's quake
planning at the front and

164
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:10,850
infrared light invisible to the human
eye so it just looks like crying sounds

165
00:10:10,850 --> 00:10:11,800
or whatever other

166
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:15,180
stats got a new jacket and then and the
batters in the pocket

167
00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:19,330
and then a used conductive thread is to
connect to the zipper

168
00:10:19,330 --> 00:10:24,550
enacted as the switch so when I just
coming to rest on my kid

169
00:10:24,550 --> 00:10:27,920
I could just unzipped my jacket hang out
for a little bit the device would be

170
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:31,410
like so many of them sign of him signing
of it would get to the code of those TVs

171
00:10:31,410 --> 00:10:33,839
in turn off admit my jacket and
germanium

172
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:37,250
i like it so much I made it again into
this flak jacket you see

173
00:10:37,250 --> 00:10:41,810
am and I wanna check it to be like that
then you can do that there's a lot of

174
00:10:41,810 --> 00:10:44,730
wearable tech now that like they want
you to try to wear this one thing all

175
00:10:44,730 --> 00:10:45,350
the time

176
00:10:45,350 --> 00:10:49,250
and on this because it's all kinda
expensive but really like you know where

177
00:10:49,250 --> 00:10:52,370
the same thing all the time you i three
different jacket and the TV B Gone is an

178
00:10:52,370 --> 00:10:54,260
expensive enough that you could put it
in high tech

179
00:10:54,260 --> 00:10:57,790
is a tutorial a.m.

180
00:10:57,790 --> 00:11:01,490
doesn't give you that stuff superpower
right and I am and scratches the

181
00:11:01,490 --> 00:11:02,200
mischievous

182
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:07,209
its this is the anti paparazzi clutch by
Adam Harvey

183
00:11:07,209 --> 00:11:11,420
he might be here hey if you're here and
I am saying life is tragic day

184
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:15,620
and what it does is a damn it talk about
giving agency over your physical space

185
00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:16,140
this is

186
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:19,589
for celebrities are the people who don't
want their their flash picture taken

187
00:11:19,589 --> 00:11:24,290
I'm it has a high powered LED and a
sensor to react to camera flashes kinda

188
00:11:24,290 --> 00:11:25,240
like a slave flash

189
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:28,780
into photography and I am the flashback
and have obliterate your face seeking

190
00:11:28,780 --> 00:11:30,220
couples your perception your faith

191
00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:33,910
and then make those images unusable by
the very real

192
00:11:33,910 --> 00:11:36,790
like physical %um paparazzi
photographers are often quite aggressive

193
00:11:36,790 --> 00:11:38,390
and and you know like

194
00:11:38,390 --> 00:11:41,740
this isn't a DIY project doesn't offer
instructions in fact you can even really

195
00:11:41,740 --> 00:11:43,440
see what it's made out in these pictures

196
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:46,630
right you can even see that it's a curse
and

197
00:11:46,630 --> 00:11:49,930
and and while I wish she'd make more
tutorial they do you think that this had

198
00:11:49,930 --> 00:11:50,300
am

199
00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:53,910
a huge cultural impact because it
creates celebrity appeal

200
00:11:53,910 --> 00:11:57,130
right and weekly worship celebrities
Anne even if we don't we're slavery

201
00:11:57,130 --> 00:11:58,120
sweet there

202
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:01,700
the things that are appealing to them
are forced into our daily lives

203
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:05,310
all the time the media and I think
that's important because

204
00:12:05,310 --> 00:12:08,860
make people see that fighting technique
pack is an option

205
00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:12,160
and they might be inspired to Tim

206
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:17,760
to try that themselves if you can if you
want a great for a surveillance talk

207
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:19,660
yesterday this is the only side we have
in common

208
00:12:19,660 --> 00:12:24,920
and this is see be downloaded at Harvey
ATP thesis project and

209
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:28,980
it fit hair and makeup that and makes
you undetectable to facial recognition

210
00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:30,329
software so

211
00:12:30,329 --> 00:12:34,040
you get surveilled and then that footage
gets gets put through

212
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:37,230
some facial recognition software to try
to identify the people

213
00:12:37,230 --> 00:12:40,100
match them at a certain time steps
messin up to a different database to

214
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:41,420
identify who they are like

215
00:12:41,420 --> 00:12:45,180
establish continuity when there's
multiple security cameras in a space

216
00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:47,839
alleghenies special recognitions of
anything like okay then he went to

217
00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:48,660
camera for

218
00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:53,459
and and I'm uses like the bridge of your
nose in the position guys the same

219
00:12:53,459 --> 00:12:58,339
the symmetrical metric ality as he
wrapped in a gf your faith

220
00:12:58,339 --> 00:13:01,550
to you and to check whether or not
you're face or not a face

221
00:13:01,550 --> 00:13:04,949
and so he found out that if you style
your hair in a certain way and you a

222
00:13:04,949 --> 00:13:06,640
symmetrical makeup on it

223
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:10,930
your faith can't be detected by the
facial recognition software

224
00:13:10,930 --> 00:13:14,120
this is the top pictures at op-ed that
they did in the New York Times got its

225
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:15,140
work

226
00:13:15,140 --> 00:13:19,959
and and I I think that that's its it's
really interesting because this

227
00:13:19,959 --> 00:13:25,860
this to that blocks here your facial
recognition it looks a lot like this

228
00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:29,760
rate and this is just personal
expression so like if this could be

229
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:32,040
they could be suffering this down the
street you might think that they're just

230
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:33,780
like this

231
00:13:33,780 --> 00:13:37,780
maybe they're like trying to hide from
surveillance cameras I think that

232
00:13:37,780 --> 00:13:41,180
it's really cool that you that there's
an invisibility to even with Chris very

233
00:13:41,180 --> 00:13:42,069
visible

234
00:13:42,069 --> 00:13:45,360
am it could pass for something that's
culturally

235
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:49,010
like okay right now which i think is
really me

236
00:13:49,010 --> 00:13:51,949
and I finally you know I can get that
like into the nose piercing explained my

237
00:13:51,949 --> 00:13:53,260
mom like no no it's cool

238
00:13:53,260 --> 00:13:56,510
to put a feather in it and then like
that the camera scan seen on the flag

239
00:13:56,510 --> 00:13:58,400
got it

240
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:02,740
my next time next

241
00:14:02,740 --> 00:14:05,850
this is the No Contact jacket and
there's a video doesn't have found that

242
00:14:05,850 --> 00:14:12,850
the sound is not an important

243
00:14:57,340 --> 00:15:00,790
so this is created by Adam written and
nearly an agent and it it's obviously a

244
00:15:00,790 --> 00:15:01,540
product type:

245
00:15:01,540 --> 00:15:04,300
on the government to market a lot of the
things that if they try to make this is

246
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:07,850
that at like this for probably investors
see huge liability insurer but it

247
00:15:07,850 --> 00:15:11,990
it's got that it's got that out the
inspirational thing right and and gives

248
00:15:11,990 --> 00:15:14,320
you a superpower makes you feel powerful

249
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:19,600
in an otherwise powerless situation
because you know if you have like

250
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:22,690
and this problem with stun guns pepper
spray you have to be able to wield it at

251
00:15:22,690 --> 00:15:24,050
the right moment right so this

252
00:15:24,050 --> 00:15:27,780
this kinda gives you a sense of security
when you feel vulnerable

253
00:15:27,780 --> 00:15:31,580
this is

254
00:15:31,580 --> 00:15:35,010
the emergency amulet by at he believed
in tiny

255
00:15:35,010 --> 00:15:38,100
was also an NYU ATP student and

256
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:44,410
it called 911 when you break the glass
vile similar to the previous

257
00:15:44,410 --> 00:15:48,380
fun to help you know help to call for
help and and and feel like you've got

258
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:48,810
this

259
00:15:48,810 --> 00:15:51,560
physical representation something safe
people often wear like a cross around

260
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:52,290
her neck right

261
00:15:52,290 --> 00:15:56,950
an honest people but like a gives you
people wear things that have symbolic

262
00:15:56,950 --> 00:16:00,200
and meaning to them and this has a
symbolic meaning that like if you ever

263
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:00,880
needed it

264
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:06,230
it could help you out Sarah getting into
a

265
00:16:06,230 --> 00:16:11,270
anti-war into surveillance and this is
the CCD Minot umbrella by Mark Sheppard

266
00:16:11,270 --> 00:16:14,480
nm so security cameras the the

267
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:17,040
the suffering they run the images
through they're looking for faces that

268
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:18,150
are also looking for people

269
00:16:18,150 --> 00:16:21,830
right like it like they don't want to
bookmark video points that's just birds

270
00:16:21,830 --> 00:16:24,870
they wanna see like if there's a person
coming and going getting authorize

271
00:16:24,870 --> 00:16:25,840
access to some place

272
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:29,760
and so but this president is it helps
you

273
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:32,990
helps you I just get your human form and
transform your silhouette

274
00:16:32,990 --> 00:16:36,960
on that security camera while also
blotting out your face again in for a

275
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:39,250
light invisible to the human eye so this
is what it looks like

276
00:16:39,250 --> 00:16:43,060
in you know to you on the left and this
is what it looks like to security camera

277
00:16:43,060 --> 00:16:43,720
on the right

278
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:47,890
and and here's another image if it from
a security camera on the left there

279
00:16:47,890 --> 00:16:51,260
and and you can see how it totally am

280
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:55,300
well it doesn't completely overwhelm the
camera the family that the the flashy

281
00:16:55,300 --> 00:17:00,300
her stance it does change the human
silhouette which might fool

282
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:04,199
the software into not thinking at the
human and thinking it's a step

283
00:17:04,199 --> 00:17:08,910
a birder a car are something else
they're not looking for and their

284
00:17:08,910 --> 00:17:13,100
experiments with headbands with infrared
LED than boy I really wish this worked

285
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:15,900
I really wish it did I wanna tell you
that works i'ma show you video that

286
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:17,040
proves that account

287
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:21,650
by the appellant really better idea the
desire and the fair fan

288
00:17:21,650 --> 00:17:24,730
a good friend of mine and member of fat
as well

289
00:17:24,730 --> 00:17:28,640
experimenting with with infrared LEDs is
no idea

290
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:35,640
except at the end

291
00:17:43,270 --> 00:17:46,559
he really wanted it to work too you can
see it faces like me

292
00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:53,559
to

293
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:12,740
so it's not reliable right and the title
in his blood tested

294
00:18:12,740 --> 00:18:17,730
a included for a muse min wouldn't bet
my life on it and that's an interesting

295
00:18:17,730 --> 00:18:20,370
point because he's like the security
ones like the necklace

296
00:18:20,370 --> 00:18:27,370
Frank I don't know that I'd bet my life
on it doesn't work right

297
00:18:29,870 --> 00:18:33,370
at work but what might work for at door

298
00:18:33,370 --> 00:18:36,090
like along with the umbrella a great
write up an interesting point yesterday

299
00:18:36,090 --> 00:18:36,580
that

300
00:18:36,580 --> 00:18:39,790
are as I a question to me after
questioning greg stock yesterday about

301
00:18:39,790 --> 00:18:43,110
am like hiding the way you walk so like
I

302
00:18:43,110 --> 00:18:46,590
you can use the CDs the umbrella to hide
that you're human form it is also maybe

303
00:18:46,590 --> 00:18:48,020
try to obfuscate your walk

304
00:18:48,020 --> 00:18:55,020
anything come this Monty Python sketch

305
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:19,179
I mean if the funny its the funny sketch
and you know it from before

306
00:19:19,179 --> 00:19:22,280
we were talking about it's definitely
not into surveillance in nine but it

307
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:23,110
could work

308
00:19:23,110 --> 00:19:26,250
you had the the umbrella and the
Ministry of Silly Walks leakage

309
00:19:26,250 --> 00:19:33,049
the pool security camera is another Adam
Harvey project Murray think I'll still

310
00:19:33,049 --> 00:19:34,280
player and FM

311
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:38,320
s garments that hide your your mid
waiting for your heat signature from

312
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:39,840
surveillance drones

313
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:43,480
not cameras we're not talking about an
hour private the identities that that

314
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:45,490
sort of private to protect our lives
from

315
00:19:45,490 --> 00:19:49,860
from a state-controlled threat and
that's why you see it's sort of like

316
00:19:49,860 --> 00:19:52,940
you see the the burkas their big because
it also don't

317
00:19:52,940 --> 00:19:58,470
welcoming him to be up to one video at
the end and I am so you know it's

318
00:19:58,470 --> 00:19:59,080
culturally

319
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:03,909
ok its and the culturally values and
culture i thought id

320
00:20:03,909 --> 00:20:07,419
try to put it in in perspective it like
me you understand we're supposed to be

321
00:20:07,419 --> 00:20:07,980
used

322
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:11,650
and and we we we do realize that thermal
emissions are blocks

323
00:20:11,650 --> 00:20:15,299
your body will overheat pretty quickly
and so might not be suitable for like a

324
00:20:15,299 --> 00:20:18,429
lot waiting for a long time and in all
climates but like many you need to go to

325
00:20:18,429 --> 00:20:19,130
the store

326
00:20:19,130 --> 00:20:22,600
and you can see here this figure in the
center

327
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:26,880
frame is wearing the a burqa and you can
only see the heat signature on the lakes

328
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:33,880
so quite effective Fisher k to 10 at
this is a collection called wearable

329
00:20:35,730 --> 00:20:36,500
solar by

330
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:39,539
fashion designer name calling them
Dongen steps

331
00:20:39,539 --> 00:20:44,390
and and I don't know that it's just it's
not mischievous it's not really

332
00:20:44,390 --> 00:20:47,650
Deviousness with so many other projects
are back I think that and

333
00:20:47,650 --> 00:20:50,700
presenting the idea of carrying your own
energy source

334
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:54,289
as as F a like fashion desirable unlike

335
00:20:54,289 --> 00:20:57,429
it might even be sexy its is pretty
powerful and

336
00:20:57,429 --> 00:21:00,929
and we haven't really seen a lot of that
get and I think we'll be seeing a lot

337
00:21:00,929 --> 00:21:02,169
more if it's soon

338
00:21:02,169 --> 00:21:05,460
and I don't know that I would wear a
black jacket out in the Sun never mind

339
00:21:05,460 --> 00:21:06,860
long enough to charge my phone

340
00:21:06,860 --> 00:21:10,250
but that the fashionable presentation
here is what's key cuz its

341
00:21:10,250 --> 00:21:13,820
is it's culturally relevant your seem
like it's not just hackers and nerds

342
00:21:13,820 --> 00:21:17,340
like this this is real fancy fashion you
can talk

343
00:21:17,340 --> 00:21:21,030
and this is the

344
00:21:21,030 --> 00:21:26,380
CHP el Chamaco by an coop himmelblau it
in an Austrian

345
00:21:26,380 --> 00:21:30,500
architecture and design studio and
screen for like for an exhibition

346
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:34,429
and anything it in the commentary & Data
Privacy made with conductive

347
00:21:34,429 --> 00:21:39,120
at fabrics that block cell phone WiFi
and Bluetooth signals

348
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:42,289
so the EU candies sure that when your
phone is

349
00:21:42,289 --> 00:21:45,809
of your location is not actually being
tracked that not every device are being

350
00:21:45,809 --> 00:21:46,720
broken into

351
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:51,230
am AP keeps it said nice lightly coat to
keep the scary from those

352
00:21:51,230 --> 00:21:57,580
CTC from the scary data thieves and
here's a

353
00:21:57,580 --> 00:22:00,990
here's another and lineup cell phone
blocking

354
00:22:00,990 --> 00:22:04,570
clothes designed by can he come Morinaga
and

355
00:22:04,570 --> 00:22:08,200
and you think it's also commentary &
Data Privacy but its

356
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:11,710
if Sam and like I'm all about p.m. at
blocking fashion

357
00:22:11,710 --> 00:22:16,570
at but p.m. is actually I advertisement
K

358
00:22:16,570 --> 00:22:19,899
stint by Trident gum who thought that
like he's been all this time on your

359
00:22:19,899 --> 00:22:21,840
found you don't spend time interacting
with

360
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:25,820
your your fellow people and and during
that time interacting with hella people

361
00:22:25,820 --> 00:22:27,820
you might be more likely to chew gum

362
00:22:27,820 --> 00:22:31,539
and I mean I love a love the idea that

363
00:22:31,539 --> 00:22:35,010
that the shiniest at it could become
popular because it represents data

364
00:22:35,010 --> 00:22:35,899
privacy

365
00:22:35,899 --> 00:22:38,970
like because it's hard to make
conductive fabric not shiny and still do

366
00:22:38,970 --> 00:22:39,309
that

367
00:22:39,309 --> 00:22:44,120
do the job so on maybe material science
get there but for now like I love that

368
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:45,370
I'm going she closed

369
00:22:45,370 --> 00:22:48,450
data privacy and I think that

370
00:22:48,450 --> 00:22:51,649
that this take a thing as a palatable
entry point for a lot of people

371
00:22:51,649 --> 00:22:54,909
who who may even be at night not ready
for this

372
00:22:54,909 --> 00:22:58,520
understand what this means but they did
they get this

373
00:22:58,520 --> 00:23:01,960
like I wear pants I'm your shirts I wear
dresses I don't see any packets on the

374
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:02,890
streets for yourself

375
00:23:02,890 --> 00:23:06,950
and likewise

376
00:23:06,950 --> 00:23:10,159
either these are some on blocking
pockets and there are a lot of them

377
00:23:10,159 --> 00:23:14,230
both the I like guys I did a DIY guy
caremark all in Germany did it

378
00:23:14,230 --> 00:23:17,280
data DIY guide Adam Harvey did the of
pocket

379
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:20,500
and and but and I am before data privacy
was this

380
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:24,570
with the hot button issue it was about
cell phones which are also a

381
00:23:24,570 --> 00:23:26,960
transformative and disruptive wearable
technology

382
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:31,169
am transforming our culture and am
erupting in a way we didn't

383
00:23:31,169 --> 00:23:35,929
into the peso that that those are the
two things right like protect your

384
00:23:35,929 --> 00:23:38,690
privacy your data and counteract the
social

385
00:23:38,690 --> 00:23:41,710
eruption within over gesture like this
one on the lower right

386
00:23:41,710 --> 00:23:44,720
if it says my phone is of for you

387
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:47,860
and so I can imagine you know you you
paper you sit down to dinner with your

388
00:23:47,860 --> 00:23:51,230
teen you back your phone in the
handkerchief and you said it on a table

389
00:23:51,230 --> 00:23:54,530
and that you know that that like really
makes it clear that you're interested in

390
00:23:54,530 --> 00:23:55,220
whatever

391
00:23:55,220 --> 00:24:01,330
damn thing you're desk at ending

392
00:24:01,330 --> 00:24:04,580
so well these things can protecting and
data privacy and

393
00:24:04,580 --> 00:24:08,590
and their protect protect against for
protected your privacy data and

394
00:24:08,590 --> 00:24:11,980
and I make you feel like you're not
being track to your cameras at filming

395
00:24:11,980 --> 00:24:12,510
you

396
00:24:12,510 --> 00:24:16,139
and and you know do this social gesture

397
00:24:16,139 --> 00:24:19,010
like I'm paying attention you're not
paying attention I found I think that in

398
00:24:19,010 --> 00:24:21,370
the future there's a there's gonna be a
more

399
00:24:21,370 --> 00:24:24,450
imminent security threat with with this
kinda

400
00:24:24,450 --> 00:24:27,750
on block like more imminent need to
block out

401
00:24:27,750 --> 00:24:31,260
signals from your body not just from
your phone and and that's because I

402
00:24:31,260 --> 00:24:33,840
watched it's pretty creepy video from
Stanford

403
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:38,179
I'm where there they're researching
midfield Wireless energy transfer so let

404
00:24:38,179 --> 00:24:41,130
you know how inductive charging you can
adaptively charger found

405
00:24:41,130 --> 00:24:44,840
it had to be really close they're
working on on

406
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:49,490
extending that distance a couple inches
so that and medical implants can be made

407
00:24:49,490 --> 00:24:50,980
a lot smaller and put the

408
00:24:50,980 --> 00:24:54,190
large bulky battery on the outside of
your body

409
00:24:54,190 --> 00:24:57,520
and the video talks about how you can
they can potentially cure Parkinson's or

410
00:24:57,520 --> 00:25:00,809
chronic pain by like putting these
little implants on your nerves

411
00:25:00,809 --> 00:25:04,360
Lake in your brain places that were much
to on

412
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:07,990
tight to put any implants are make
implants before because they had these

413
00:25:07,990 --> 00:25:09,220
big bulky batteries

414
00:25:09,220 --> 00:25:12,220
so I just I'm a little nervous that you
might need

415
00:25:12,220 --> 00:25:15,320
wanted these Colts to prevent someone
from like hacking

416
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:20,000
like you know creatively misusing your
body implants

417
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:24,639
in the future because if you are known
to have one of these and someone wants

418
00:25:24,639 --> 00:25:26,080
to mess with you they could probably

419
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:30,789
like pretty pretty bad if they created a
device that interfere that used that mid

420
00:25:30,789 --> 00:25:34,520
range wireless energy transfer to do
something that's a nice

421
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:37,760
you every time in days by Neal
Stephenson science fiction

422
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:40,580
the all that in an attack in their
season and a boxing like when you get

423
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:43,460
convicted of a crime they inject evening
about into your bloodstream in its

424
00:25:43,460 --> 00:25:44,929
defense on the prison

425
00:25:44,929 --> 00:25:48,559
it's just that if you walk too far out
on begins all in and about to explode at

426
00:25:48,559 --> 00:25:50,059
once

427
00:25:50,059 --> 00:25:54,539
so I could that jacket help you escape
from that prison

428
00:25:54,539 --> 00:25:59,870
are similarly to thank you now fight
back against the man

429
00:25:59,870 --> 00:26:03,389
here's an idea that it sounds so that
came just in time event are asked to

430
00:26:03,389 --> 00:26:03,840
keep it

431
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:06,919
three-quarters

432
00:26:06,919 --> 00:26:11,620
stated some point every twenty six point
in seconds

433
00:26:11,620 --> 00:26:14,659
a violent assault causing still

434
00:26:14,659 --> 00:26:18,419
but did you know that almost half of
those assaults the undocumented

435
00:26:18,419 --> 00:26:22,460
and many documented cases are simply on
prosecutable

436
00:26:22,460 --> 00:26:26,020
violent assault happen anytime

437
00:26:26,020 --> 00:26:30,360
and no matter how prepared you think you
are actively responding with issue we

438
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:31,710
anticipate he retired

439
00:26:31,710 --> 00:26:35,300
that's near impossible so attackers

440
00:26:35,300 --> 00:26:38,360
free emergency response cancer on

441
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:41,740
really is there evidence collected
actually be news

442
00:26:41,740 --> 00:26:46,840
to close a terrible chapter in someone's
life the good news is

443
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:51,000
this is about to make it possible for
sounds to be documented

444
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:54,530
looks like ear clip break mom

445
00:26:54,530 --> 00:26:58,140
her what you don't see is it high-tech
sensors

446
00:26:58,140 --> 00:27:02,730
only triggered by the forces the cruel
injuries a Bluetooth signal a min from

wanted instantly turns on your

00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:22,300
forward but it's just a clip bright
wrong

454
00:27:22,300 --> 00:27:26,440
this is safety this is sick 3d

455
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:30,100
this is they said about as much so that
I can take

456
00:27:30,100 --> 00:27:33,250
he has everything on it

457
00:27:33,250 --> 00:27:36,280
and this is the first time here clip I

458
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:40,020
average when Arthur Emmanuel am now in
partnership with me

459
00:27:40,020 --> 00:27:43,760
brand which is kinda interesting and I
think a funded IndieGoGo the hasn't

460
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:45,220
shipped yet so we'll see what actually

461
00:27:45,220 --> 00:27:48,790
they think accelerometer and a Bluetooth
module just like that same divisive the

462
00:27:48,790 --> 00:27:49,980
site I Spit on Your my

463
00:27:49,980 --> 00:27:53,140
mountain biking helmet when you got now
making we did it

464
00:27:53,140 --> 00:27:56,380
if it tear down on them and this this
commercial makes me

465
00:27:56,380 --> 00:28:01,770
after to make you uncomfortable because
it uses fear in its marketing

466
00:28:01,770 --> 00:28:05,040
rain an idea that like like a violent

467
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:09,070
could happen any time by Ash I think
that's

468
00:28:09,070 --> 00:28:12,450
its that'll a misguided but the am it

469
00:28:12,450 --> 00:28:16,400
an idea that you don't know how it works
don't worry defense is only activated

470
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:17,040
with

471
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:20,170
impacts that cause injury well what is
that like a coder have to write that

472
00:28:20,170 --> 00:28:21,860
cold rain coaters make fifty

473
00:28:21,860 --> 00:28:25,120
I'm and and out s it but it's very
interesting

474
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:31,360
example love them the way we really want
wearable tech to make us feel safe and

475
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:34,230
and I would argue that we needed many
independent understand the technology

476
00:28:34,230 --> 00:28:35,080
little more

477
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:38,180
and that this is tap this

478
00:28:38,180 --> 00:28:41,970
this that product to I know when I'm
shopping for hair clips and I'm thinking

479
00:28:41,970 --> 00:28:43,370
about it documenting

480
00:28:43,370 --> 00:28:47,490
well

481
00:28:47,490 --> 00:28:50,529
and then I think that it's it is easier
to creatively miss you something that's

482
00:28:50,529 --> 00:28:51,669
popular and out there

483
00:28:51,669 --> 00:28:55,250
makers as more people at their hands on
it more people I'm trying to use it for

484
00:28:55,250 --> 00:28:56,740
different purposes this

485
00:28:56,740 --> 00:29:00,590
as I have found but it's just its
Japanese song

486
00:29:00,590 --> 00:29:05,419
convicted a Japanese toy company called
add to cart on the arts made

487
00:29:05,419 --> 00:29:08,760
this this product app called me to
camille

488
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:12,750
and if its and an RFID her NFC tag

489
00:29:12,750 --> 00:29:17,510
your chip in and an LED in a nail
sticker and you can buy these in Japan

490
00:29:17,510 --> 00:29:20,520
now I would I'm China have this order
them online account yet but an

491
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:25,659
it's just fun for Japanese schoolgirls
or whoever else wants to wear it and

492
00:29:25,659 --> 00:29:29,880
but and like this commercials presenting
at like like is in itself an ass I

493
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:33,630
admits no mine I had to have to have
your

494
00:29:33,630 --> 00:29:36,850
at males light up when you use your
chance passer when you're on the phone

495
00:29:36,850 --> 00:29:37,559
their

496
00:29:37,559 --> 00:29:41,169
are when you're like using RFID door
access cards neck so cool

497
00:29:41,169 --> 00:29:44,279
and I love that because the more coolant

498
00:29:44,279 --> 00:29:48,010
like our legal people think this concept
is the more like fun stuff will happen

499
00:29:48,010 --> 00:29:49,169
in the future

500
00:29:49,169 --> 00:29:52,370
using this tactic knowledge I think that
if you replace it with an infrared LED

501
00:29:52,370 --> 00:29:55,350
you can write an app that like when you
go like this in plastic it turns out

502
00:29:55,350 --> 00:29:55,860
that he

503
00:29:55,860 --> 00:30:01,510
Spain and FTP on the brain I would like
to do that I don't know if they take my

504
00:30:01,510 --> 00:30:02,299
nail polish

505
00:30:02,299 --> 00:30:05,429
unlock my phone p I'm

506
00:30:05,429 --> 00:30:09,029
but my point it's great easier to
creatively is miss you something

507
00:30:09,029 --> 00:30:13,950
popular so I hope the pickup truck and
this is the reason

508
00:30:13,950 --> 00:30:17,740
pay I think that it's important for
technology to present be presented in a

509
00:30:17,740 --> 00:30:21,409
more fashionable context acid that it
appeals to a broader audience

510
00:30:21,409 --> 00:30:25,159
this is a Raspberry Pi a heads up
display and this is Diane von

511
00:30:25,159 --> 00:30:25,630
Furstenberg

512
00:30:25,630 --> 00:30:28,760
bring her Google glass at her cutting
diane von furstenberg

513
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:33,760
thank there's room for both of these
things I think we need more desire sir

514
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:36,330
present technology in a way that makes
me wanna wear it to reflect your

515
00:30:36,330 --> 00:30:37,289
personal style

516
00:30:37,289 --> 00:30:41,299
infinite personal style so that using to
be infinite wearable technologies to

517
00:30:41,299 --> 00:30:42,799
appeal to all the styles because

518
00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:46,770
instead of a device you hold in your
hand wearable tech really

519
00:30:46,770 --> 00:30:50,070
when you put something on your body it
says something about how you want to be

520
00:30:50,070 --> 00:30:53,299
seen in the world so I think we're going
to see stuff get

521
00:30:53,299 --> 00:30:57,159
less visible or more fashionable so like
we can have to the that we could have

522
00:30:57,159 --> 00:31:00,899
like the Google glass contact lens for
firefighters in either hand three

523
00:31:00,899 --> 00:31:05,070
and and I hope we have more fashion
representations are things that make you

524
00:31:05,070 --> 00:31:05,679
really wanna

525
00:31:05,679 --> 00:31:09,799
the mind-body so I mean I think the
destructive wearable tech has the

526
00:31:09,799 --> 00:31:11,490
potential to transform

527
00:31:11,490 --> 00:31:15,179
crime give us you don't make us feel
like a real life superheroes and maker

528
00:31:15,179 --> 00:31:16,350
sensors work for us

529
00:31:16,350 --> 00:31:20,190
and when when stuff because you can tell
something has

530
00:31:20,190 --> 00:31:24,690
has critical cultural impact on access
to be anti it right so this is just the

531
00:31:24,690 --> 00:31:26,179
glass all scripts that picture

532
00:31:26,179 --> 00:31:29,549
that you can put on your like a res
repair people buy into on your network

533
00:31:29,549 --> 00:31:30,149
to

534
00:31:30,149 --> 00:31:34,909
detecting kick am Google glass from a
WiFi networks at the other store

535
00:31:34,909 --> 00:31:38,260
and he didn't want people to be sharing
videos from your story to put this on

536
00:31:38,260 --> 00:31:39,049
your network in

537
00:31:39,049 --> 00:31:42,260
thank cannot sell there's like

538
00:31:42,260 --> 00:31:48,730
plan to attack and there's anti wearable
tech but I really want to encourage you

539
00:31:48,730 --> 00:31:49,370
guys

540
00:31:49,370 --> 00:31:53,059
to prove these creatively misuse this
technology

541
00:31:53,059 --> 00:31:57,000
the stuff kinda sucks and I think that
it makes us

542
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:00,179
like worship data rate and data
worshipers

543
00:32:00,179 --> 00:32:04,159
in its okay i Capelli sensors you can't
we can be checking our heart rate in our

544
00:32:04,159 --> 00:32:05,149
steps constantly

545
00:32:05,149 --> 00:32:09,250
and but then we're kinda told how to
feel about that data by the company that

546
00:32:09,250 --> 00:32:09,990
made the thing

547
00:32:09,990 --> 00:32:13,610
thank making me tea at an Italian your
fitness you make your goal today

548
00:32:13,610 --> 00:32:14,990
according our sensors

549
00:32:14,990 --> 00:32:18,070
and it's just a little weird to have
this like blind trusts

550
00:32:18,070 --> 00:32:22,020
for these that like let someone tell you
how to feel about the doubt about your

551
00:32:22,020 --> 00:32:24,320
body and then they're probably
collecting and you know mel

552
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:27,260
and using it for who knows what so I
think it's really important to

553
00:32:27,260 --> 00:32:29,539
creatively misuse technology that out
there now

554
00:32:29,539 --> 00:32:33,510
and sell that we can like break a small
10

555
00:32:33,510 --> 00:32:36,600
I'm

556
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:40,860
snowden to just a runs down i sat at the
technology enables descent

557
00:32:40,860 --> 00:32:44,299
and where those are great way to show
everybody else what that means

558
00:32:44,299 --> 00:32:47,419
where the cow on your person it six
expression have your beliefs

559
00:32:47,419 --> 00:32:51,270
I will close with this with no comment

560
00:32:51,270 --> 00:32:57,510
thank you very much

561
00:32:57,510 --> 00:33:02,429
if you'd like to come pick me up here
and a live show on TV every week

562
00:33:02,429 --> 00:33:08,409
packing I can't even ask a question if
you have time now and checking my cock

563
00:33:08,409 --> 00:33:11,799
if we have time now and I think an
exorcist II like to see a couple

564
00:33:11,799 --> 00:33:13,840
questions if there are any in the
audience is this

565
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:20,840
as a crowd mic in the middle is to let
you know when you're when you're our

566
00:33:23,190 --> 00:33:25,389
freddy is being read without your
consent

567
00:33:25,389 --> 00:33:28,940
i think is a great detector for example
if you got EZ Pass in New York if you

568
00:33:28,940 --> 00:33:30,399
saw puking monkey stock

569
00:33:30,399 --> 00:33:35,039
om and it's being read up for a lot of
different reasons that do not have

570
00:33:35,039 --> 00:33:37,080
anything to do with the Terms of Service

571
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:41,690
and this would would next silently let
you know

572
00:33:41,690 --> 00:33:45,559
that's a great point is another reason
everyone order them online

573
00:33:45,559 --> 00:33:50,780
I got a question yeah why should we as
people who build technology

574
00:33:50,780 --> 00:33:54,429
a low making something fashionable

575
00:33:54,429 --> 00:33:57,580
the make it look like a
twentieth-century

576
00:33:57,580 --> 00:34:00,950
no in technological she's love apparel

577
00:34:00,950 --> 00:34:05,289
why not creating new aesthetic or pro
show of the fact that we were in tech

578
00:34:05,289 --> 00:34:08,200
yeah I guess I'm anything if you don't
have to make it look like back to be

579
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:09,020
fashionable you

580
00:34:09,020 --> 00:34:12,319
we have to if the make our technology
fashionable

581
00:34:12,319 --> 00:34:15,470
and palatable to a broader audience by
making it express

582
00:34:15,470 --> 00:34:18,649
different types of personal style not
just Diane von Furstenberg or at very

583
00:34:18,649 --> 00:34:20,869
high guy but all the way in between so

584
00:34:20,869 --> 00:34:23,119
I know that that there's several people
out here who are helping make that

585
00:34:23,119 --> 00:34:24,000
happen I'm trying

586
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:27,190
could provide cover fire service
questions

587
00:34:27,190 --> 00:34:30,690
a to what it took to what extent is

588
00:34:30,690 --> 00:34:34,050
fashion created by precedent what people

589
00:34:34,050 --> 00:34:37,159
are wearing now and to what extent is
secreted by

590
00:34:37,159 --> 00:34:41,169
the actions advertisers and media and
the guys who actually do the design

591
00:34:41,169 --> 00:34:43,790
passionate highly influenced by
advertising it's true that whatever you

592
00:34:43,790 --> 00:34:46,480
wearing right now is already out of
style select fashion is always

593
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:47,510
overturning there's

594
00:34:47,510 --> 00:34:49,810
interesting parallels between
intellectual property open-source

595
00:34:49,810 --> 00:34:52,929
hardware and fashion make it they don't
have copyright a passion is I'm so as

596
00:34:52,929 --> 00:34:55,339
soon as they really something it's
already been knocked off in in

597
00:34:55,339 --> 00:34:56,970
department stores so they need it

598
00:34:56,970 --> 00:35:00,080
needed push for the newest attic so I
would encourage you

599
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:03,960
your're doing a man pushing the new a
static and

600
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:07,839
helping make that I mean and a second
reaching a lot a wider audience I don't

601
00:35:07,839 --> 00:35:08,440
mean to say that

602
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:13,410
in suggest that you have to comply but
interesting to see fashion designers

603
00:35:13,410 --> 00:35:19,290
fashion companies become tech companies
right

604
00:35:19,290 --> 00:35:23,920
for I like my videos online on aside
from fashion what you think

605
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:28,359
the is required to accelerate the
adoption World Technologies

606
00:35:28,359 --> 00:35:33,800
I think and my job if it is I'm doing
that made in China really hard to an

607
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:37,830
make like teenagers want to learn how to
program because they want their prom

608
00:35:37,830 --> 00:35:39,300
dress to light up when they dance

609
00:35:39,300 --> 00:35:42,569
I think that's really important
education and tutorials about technology

610
00:35:42,569 --> 00:35:42,960
and

611
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:46,040
and showing because people need to be
inspired and so

612
00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:49,470
in ins making projects and inspiring new
group for people who might not have been

613
00:35:49,470 --> 00:35:50,369
exposed to

614
00:35:50,369 --> 00:35:54,230
the idea that they can create their own
technology specifically

615
00:35:54,230 --> 00:35:58,650
I focus I like the teenage girls has a
lifetime

616
00:35:58,650 --> 00:36:01,670
thank you

617
00:36:01,670 --> 00:36:05,130
a great talk mom so in health care

618
00:36:05,130 --> 00:36:08,369
was on these newer emerging like
wearable health care

619
00:36:08,369 --> 00:36:12,030
devices that consumers are buying things
like not not just like actively monitors

620
00:36:12,030 --> 00:36:12,740
but even some

621
00:36:12,740 --> 00:36:16,270
glucose monitors and and things like
that we would you think that does for

622
00:36:16,270 --> 00:36:19,290
like the social contract between care
providers and patients

623
00:36:19,290 --> 00:36:23,510
where where's that that that social
contract mister changing

624
00:36:23,510 --> 00:36:26,960
me my social contact they contain any
that the doctors telling its okay to

625
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:28,119
wear this thing all the time

626
00:36:28,119 --> 00:36:30,930
yeah I mean it's not something that's
gonna be prescription based in this news

627
00:36:30,930 --> 00:36:31,540
that's can

628
00:36:31,540 --> 00:36:35,630
consumer yeah I think that is cool in
insulin insulin pumps are becoming ISD

629
00:36:35,630 --> 00:36:39,770
on time who with diabetic and insulin
pump and she

630
00:36:39,770 --> 00:36:43,210
she wanted to make a like fashion
accessories for the insulin pump which

631
00:36:43,210 --> 00:36:43,550
would

632
00:36:43,550 --> 00:36:47,250
crafty ones like this fabric flowers and
stuff and that sort of like made her

633
00:36:47,250 --> 00:36:50,369
feel good about unfashionable about her

634
00:36:50,369 --> 00:36:53,510
medically prescribed device but
medicines hard it's hard to get device

635
00:36:53,510 --> 00:36:54,580
is approved

636
00:36:54,580 --> 00:36:59,069
for for patient use and sell I think it
it takes things to a lot slower in the

637
00:36:59,069 --> 00:37:00,680
medical world we're talking about new

638
00:37:00,680 --> 00:37:04,440
new advancements in in technology and
making things more like

639
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:08,220
body friendlier or are like you know
because if you prescribe that device

640
00:37:08,220 --> 00:37:10,910
then you're not choosing to wear it as
part of your personal expression you

641
00:37:10,910 --> 00:37:12,140
need it to live

642
00:37:12,140 --> 00:37:15,430
I'm I think we're gonna see more like
you know

643
00:37:15,430 --> 00:37:18,900
cooler options and I hate to say it but
like more color options is the way it's

644
00:37:18,900 --> 00:37:20,010
going right now

645
00:37:20,010 --> 00:37:23,150
on and and we'll see DIY RSE at

646
00:37:23,150 --> 00:37:27,430
fashionably incorporate them into their
like more people are wearing devices the

647
00:37:27,430 --> 00:37:28,060
more

648
00:37:28,060 --> 00:37:31,490
fashionable they become so like with
apple and their newest

649
00:37:31,490 --> 00:37:34,690
hope kid AP either some other devices

650
00:37:34,690 --> 00:37:38,069
forthcoming SmartWatch do you think that
there's gonna be a lot of rather than

651
00:37:38,069 --> 00:37:39,310
just the industry driving it

652
00:37:39,310 --> 00:37:42,470
Israel on consumers really driving the
push the stuff into each other's pockets

653
00:37:42,470 --> 00:37:46,069
sure any part in anything like when
patient ask a give me this

654
00:37:46,069 --> 00:37:49,770
in a more girly colors like that not
gonna happen but front but

655
00:37:49,770 --> 00:37:53,330
for companies like Apple that definitely
yet consumer pressure definitely have

656
00:37:53,330 --> 00:37:54,130
some

657
00:37:54,130 --> 00:37:57,970
as hard in medicine

658
00:37:57,970 --> 00:38:02,660
see spoke about NMC an RFID and a chip
price of a while ago so I was wondering

659
00:38:02,660 --> 00:38:03,619
if you could just

660
00:38:03,619 --> 00:38:07,970
talk about the intersections wearable
and how you think family interplay

661
00:38:07,970 --> 00:38:11,280
however high interplay with but with
like Lance I yet

662
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:14,450
well like for you I think it did you
think you could like make you feel are

663
00:38:14,450 --> 00:38:17,790
like checked himself many years ago and
%uh video campaigns the online at the

664
00:38:17,790 --> 00:38:19,160
home surgery read it

665
00:38:19,160 --> 00:38:22,160
and and Mike and many many many years
later

666
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:25,640
the video where I put the RPD taking my
nail polish is popularly have if they

667
00:38:25,640 --> 00:38:27,650
get the other people do before but it's
like

668
00:38:27,650 --> 00:38:30,980
it wasn't as popular and I think it's
because like dim technologies

669
00:38:30,980 --> 00:38:34,560
male-dominated field right and you guys
don't wear nail polish damage

670
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:37,730
so I think that like that touches my
point if

671
00:38:37,730 --> 00:38:41,910
wearable tech going invisible or more
fashionable

672
00:38:41,910 --> 00:38:45,089
rightly either it completely hidden
inside your nail polish

673
00:38:45,089 --> 00:38:48,850
or inside your hand or its and you wear
it as an overexpression

674
00:38:48,850 --> 00:38:53,369
here yourself I put mine in clear nail
polish they like the way it looks

675
00:38:53,369 --> 00:38:56,540
thanks that time

676
00:38:56,540 --> 00:39:00,060
guys sorry if I'll be around for a few
minutes you wanna contact thank you so

677
00:39:00,060 --> 00:39:07,060

680
00:41:34,180 --> 00:41:34,910
two things

681
00:41:34,910 --> 00:41:41,520
to care about in this world one of them
is said

682
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:48,520
if

683
00:41:58,230 --> 00:42:05,230
yes but the thing is

684
00:42:08,320 --> 00:42:13,130
one thing I did discover is that yeah

685
00:42:13,130 --> 00:42:18,240
one thing I did discover is that arm

686
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:21,260
one thing I did discover

687
00:42:21,260 --> 00:42:24,730
and fine fun yes want

688
00:42:24,730 --> 00:42:29,170
if its actually back

689
00:42:29,170 --> 00:42:36,170

doing it and you will find out would I
walk over and look

692
00:43:48,740 --> 00:43:54,050
windows 7 so old

693
00:43:54,050 --> 00:43:59,260
solution

694
00:43:59,260 --> 00:44:06,260
changes

695
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:19,000
arm

696
00:45:41,320 --> 00:45:45,359
is is actually working okay everyone
while we work out a system might not

697
00:45:45,359 --> 00:45:47,750
hold out another fucking thing up in my
face

698
00:45:47,750 --> 00:45:52,880
I arm II we're just fixing distal video

00:54:03,950 --> 00:54:07,310
on this is on

746
00:54:07,310 --> 00:54:10,460
I will describe it but i just want to
see this pile love

747
00:54:10,460 --> 00:54:15,470
documents arm these are all the
documents related to a court case this

748
00:54:15,470 --> 00:54:19,070
would be all the testimony that was
entered in across the six-day trial

749
00:54:19,070 --> 00:54:24,700
on this would be the fuck you this would

752
00:54:30,180 --> 00:54:34,670

want to make sure you knew about it

753
00:54:34,670 --> 00:54:40,830
I am I'm amo veteran of talking and so
I'm really not want to buy into a lot of

754
00:54:40,830 --> 00:54:42,820
the stay up in front anywhere you guys
have been

755
00:54:42,820 --> 00:54:46,190
enjoying an ironic Big Brother
presentation by Snowden

756
00:54:46,190 --> 00:54:49,730
so there's really no reason for me to do
the same thing so I hope you all don't

757
00:54:49,730 --> 00:54:51,550
mind the things are a little more

758
00:54:51,550 --> 00:54:55,260
interactive than they need to be

759
00:54:55,260 --> 00:54:59,240
years in two years as well as talks okay

760
00:54:59,240 --> 00:55:05,100
Tom so hollywood has a secret

761
00:55:05,100 --> 00:55:08,610
arm hollywood has a secret here's the
secret: okay

762
00:55:08,610 --> 00:55:12,600
if you take eighty image of a guy

763
00:55:12,600 --> 00:55:16,270
or girl and then you show a picture I
love

764
00:55:16,270 --> 00:55:20,000
the opposite sex arm and the switch back
to the first one

765
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:23,610
the audience will immediately decide
that that person

766
00:55:23,610 --> 00:55:27,940
lusts is watching or is otherwise in the
same physical space

767
00:55:27,940 --> 00:55:32,540
as the other person in other words the
pictures sit quietly

768
00:55:32,540 --> 00:55:36,870
and we do all the work and the reason
why is because we're human beings and

769
00:55:36,870 --> 00:55:39,260
when you see something disappear into a
rock

770
00:55:39,260 --> 00:55:42,350
you know it's probably going to come out
again and when you see the other side

771
00:55:42,350 --> 00:55:42,830
you got

772
00:55:42,830 --> 00:55:45,830
hope out again I'm needed arm and so

773
00:55:45,830 --> 00:55:49,910
so what what kinda wired this way we
draw conclusions we put things aside

774
00:55:49,910 --> 00:55:53,580
that's what we do in hollywood long the
goal

775
00:55:53,580 --> 00:55:57,870
discovered that by putting these images
together and hosting them somewhere

776
00:55:57,870 --> 00:56:01,590
they could pull people out there
otherwise wretched and terrible lives

777
00:56:01,590 --> 00:56:06,170
and make them feel like they were
someplace else and over time the refined

778
00:56:06,170 --> 00:56:06,670
that

779
00:56:06,670 --> 00:56:10,460
but they often didn't bite giving you
the same picture of the guy

780
00:56:10,460 --> 00:56:13,890
looking at the picture of the girl
looking back at the picture of the guy

781
00:56:13,890 --> 00:56:17,170
they quickly refined it to a picture of
a car

782
00:56:17,170 --> 00:56:21,020
chasing after another car in which the
guy in the front car

783
00:56:21,020 --> 00:56:24,670
with someone you liked and someone
behind it with someone you didn't like

784
00:56:24,670 --> 00:56:28,480
you have other stories too not many

785
00:56:28,480 --> 00:56:33,310
but this is what the secret was the
secret was the product inside is not

786
00:56:33,310 --> 00:56:36,950
special but if you're the only game in
town

787
00:56:36,950 --> 00:56:41,100
and you work hard to make yourself the
only game in town the net product is the

788
00:56:41,100 --> 00:56:41,600
product

789
00:56:41,600 --> 00:56:45,470
and it's fantastic and people write film
criticism about it

790
00:56:45,470 --> 00:56:49,170
and everyone will be happy soul

791
00:56:49,170 --> 00:56:53,130
this is about a court case and arm the
court case is called

792
00:56:53,130 --> 00:56:56,560
RM unit well technically universal
verses from your days

793
00:56:56,560 --> 00:57:00,690
are but many people calm call it the
ECSS case that looks to herbal

794
00:57:00,690 --> 00:57:04,470
how ironic that something about visual
data being

795
00:57:04,470 --> 00:57:08,990
unencrypted it looks so terrible
supported by HDMI

796
00:57:08,990 --> 00:57:12,760
I like that I like that I like the
Iranian ago the irony

797
00:57:12,760 --> 00:57:16,880
going with learning om and so

798
00:57:16,880 --> 00:57:20,690
there well so this is about a court case
but it's not

799
00:57:20,690 --> 00:57:24,160
about a court case because court cases
are pouring in

800
00:57:24,160 --> 00:57:28,380
cookies on interesting unless you're in
them and what you really want to do is

801
00:57:28,380 --> 00:57:30,130
you want to look at what happened in
court case

802
00:57:30,130 --> 00:57:34,220
and then you wanna figure out what can
you learn from it what do we learn for

803
00:57:34,220 --> 00:57:38,800
or we'll just keep recycling the same
problems like we recycle the same talks

804
00:57:38,800 --> 00:57:42,850
like we recycle the same movies so let's
try to learn something new from this

805
00:57:42,850 --> 00:57:44,250
crazy dumb thing

806
00:57:44,250 --> 00:57:47,960
one day I got a phone call an

807
00:57:47,960 --> 00:57:51,060
I got a phone call I mean it was
actually a money I come from is

808
00:57:51,060 --> 00:57:51,780
basically

809
00:57:51,780 --> 00:57:56,170
arm manual goals team for the purposes
this talk will call air corley

810
00:57:56,170 --> 00:58:02,220
and who arm wanted me to talk with the
FF because the effect had a storage unit

811
00:58:02,220 --> 00:58:05,410
and the storage unit was full love old
EF up stuff

812
00:58:05,410 --> 00:58:09,760
and that they had hit the term-limited
like 10 years that the stuff I've been

813
00:58:09,760 --> 00:58:11,880
sitting in there and they said we want
to get rid of it

814
00:58:11,880 --> 00:58:16,060
were in the and they contacted the
people who were in some of the cases to

815
00:58:16,060 --> 00:58:16,420
go

816
00:58:16,420 --> 00:58:20,590
what do we do with the old junk from
your case in this case it was for the

817
00:58:20,590 --> 00:58:21,840
CSS case

818
00:58:21,840 --> 00:58:25,020
and they're called you had been involved
in that he said basically you should

819
00:58:25,020 --> 00:58:27,760
give it to Jason Scott

820
00:58:27,760 --> 00:58:31,640
and contacted me and I said fantastic

821
00:58:31,640 --> 00:58:36,470
and I waited eagerly by my mailbox for
it

822
00:58:36,470 --> 00:58:39,480
five months later while laws on my way

823
00:58:39,480 --> 00:58:43,780
on a vacation trip a truck pulled up

824
00:58:43,780 --> 00:58:49,730
with the lotto boxes and I was leaving
in two hours

825
00:58:49,730 --> 00:58:53,320
desperate as you can see it's winter my
brother and I

826
00:58:53,320 --> 00:58:57,510
stacked it up and put plastic over it

827
00:58:57,510 --> 00:59:02,070
to protected from the wind and I also
knew I didn't have much place for this I

828
00:59:02,070 --> 00:59:03,050
didn't have much space

829
00:59:03,050 --> 00:59:06,830
in my shipping container yes i've a
shipping container and

830
00:59:06,830 --> 00:59:10,720
so I did the best thing to do which was
put out on the Internet

831
00:59:10,720 --> 00:59:14,060
with violins playing going this is
history look where

832
00:59:14,060 --> 00:59:18,340
history is very cold and waited eagerly
for somebody to go

833
00:59:18,340 --> 00:59:21,380
all history will give you a warm cup a
coffee

834
00:59:21,380 --> 00:59:24,880
and a little Margie and let you sit by
the fire

835
00:59:24,880 --> 00:59:28,930
inside I printed some pictures what
you're looking at here some

836
00:59:28,930 --> 00:59:32,570
some hash marks compassion some
encrypted files printed

837
00:59:32,570 --> 00:59:35,620
out for pages and pages

838
00:59:35,620 --> 00:59:39,420
this is IRC discussions about DVD's

839
00:59:39,420 --> 00:59:44,210
printed by the rem there were seventy
five boxes

840
00:59:44,210 --> 00:59:47,330
above material sealed up with

841
00:59:47,330 --> 00:59:51,400
obscure markings outside only some of
which cause me the twitch with names

842
00:59:51,400 --> 00:59:52,760
like defendant

843
00:59:52,760 --> 00:59:58,340
and plaintiff's complaint and injunction

844
00:59:58,340 --> 01:00:02,220
inside of course was this whole thing
about you know history

845
01:00:02,220 --> 01:00:05,500
and and I would love these little
moments like this little transcription

846
01:00:05,500 --> 01:00:06,660
from the thing where

847
01:00:06,660 --> 01:00:10,550
the guy has to spell what Google is

848
01:00:10,550 --> 01:00:13,870
you go to any besides hot pot

849
01:00:13,870 --> 01:00:17,600
yeah I actually went to Google G 00 GLE

850
01:00:17,600 --> 01:00:22,120
so I knew this was like weirdly
historical in strange

851
01:00:22,120 --> 01:00:27,070
and things like I don't know hard
clipping a for a floppy disk to a piece

852
01:00:27,070 --> 01:00:31,570
of paper as a way to indicate the work
had been done

853
01:00:31,570 --> 01:00:34,350
anyways good was good it was good to
have a sort of historical data and I

854
01:00:34,350 --> 01:00:36,870
click lot of historical data to put
those kinda interesting

855
01:00:36,870 --> 01:00:39,950
right well it was the yom the Potters

856
01:00:39,950 --> 01:00:43,830
arm on Heidi and and Bruce

857
01:00:43,830 --> 01:00:47,720
who stepped forward and said we'll take
it and I drove a truck if seventy five

858
01:00:47,720 --> 01:00:50,220
boxes down to their storage area

859
01:00:50,220 --> 01:00:53,790
actually the garage and loaded them up

860
01:00:53,790 --> 01:00:57,060
barely having cracked one but they took
it

861
01:00:57,060 --> 01:01:02,230
so god bless them they took them and
save them

862
01:01:02,230 --> 01:01:06,420
and that's where it ends right that's
where it ends this thing that was lonely

863
01:01:06,420 --> 01:01:10,210
found a home somewhere in in in the
washington DC area of

864
01:01:10,210 --> 01:01:13,390
and was soon to live

865
01:01:13,390 --> 01:01:17,630
an endless nothing life once again
stored away in the darkness have history

866
01:01:17,630 --> 01:01:19,420
in for gotten

867
01:01:19,420 --> 01:01:23,370
but no was in fact was something like
this

868
01:01:23,370 --> 01:01:27,310
so this is a quote from Isaac Newton arm
Isaac Newton you know he's

869
01:01:27,310 --> 01:01:32,480
he was a pretty intense dude this was a
guy who invented calculus to win a bet

870
01:01:32,480 --> 01:01:35,620
right when he was twenty-seven that's
the source that whole we got a badass

871
01:01:35,620 --> 01:01:37,640
your quote we talked about it

872
01:01:37,640 --> 01:01:40,290
because he's talked about the fact that
the win a bet he invents calculus to

873
01:01:40,290 --> 01:01:41,900
prove what he saying

874
01:01:41,900 --> 01:01:45,440
and you're reading you not gonna get
this right of so you will and God bless

875
01:01:45,440 --> 01:01:46,690
you but

876
01:01:46,690 --> 01:01:49,780
are not gross bodies in like
controversial to one another and may not

877
01:01:49,780 --> 01:01:53,190
bodies receive much of their activity
from the particles of light which enter

878
01:01:53,190 --> 01:01:54,790
into their composition

879
01:01:54,790 --> 01:01:59,220
this is the beginning of the nuclear
bomb this is when human beings start

880
01:01:59,220 --> 01:02:00,930
figuring out that she can blow up

881
01:02:00,930 --> 01:02:04,730
really fast Matt faster than we expect

882
01:02:04,730 --> 01:02:08,210
and if we trigger of things we will
explode

883
01:02:08,210 --> 01:02:13,130
took a few years from 1706 but he was
sitting around but she invented direct

884
01:02:13,130 --> 01:02:18,440
messaging to discuss Taylor now

885
01:02:18,440 --> 01:02:22,890
many have you make no but the 2600 case
the ECSS case

886
01:02:22,890 --> 01:02:25,890
the DVD case are universal

887
01:02:25,890 --> 01:02:29,650
at al verses from your days at alittle
has different names

888
01:02:29,650 --> 01:02:32,840
some of you may remember it with the
snap

889
01:02:32,840 --> 01:02:37,080
trap memory of some geek or some you
might actually be

890
01:02:37,080 --> 01:02:40,470
completely unsure what it is other than
it was bad you may not even know what

891
01:02:40,470 --> 01:02:42,090
the verdict once

892
01:02:42,090 --> 01:02:47,060
are not going to poll why do that to you
sitting on 2600 other collections of

893
01:02:47,060 --> 01:02:50,640
PDF serve all the official stop in other
words the PDF version of

894
01:02:50,640 --> 01:02:55,110
this material arm it's all sitting up
there so if you're the kind of person

895
01:02:55,110 --> 01:02:58,750
who wants to read through it line by
line

896
01:02:58,750 --> 01:03:02,460
knock yourself out knockout everyone
around you return home on the way to

897
01:03:02,460 --> 01:03:03,060
work

898
01:03:03,060 --> 01:03:06,950
while driving just do it have fun
alright look so basically

899
01:03:06,950 --> 01:03:11,070
you know you have these wonderful legal
terms like a poll reply brief in and so

900
01:03:11,070 --> 01:03:11,790
on

901
01:03:11,790 --> 01:03:15,140
and I'll go into the case was but you
know that's what it sits right now but

902
01:03:15,140 --> 01:03:17,790
to PDF the officially released things

903
01:03:17,790 --> 01:03:22,010
right or you can go into Wikipedia and
return to their description of what this

904
01:03:22,010 --> 01:03:23,480
case was in

905
01:03:23,480 --> 01:03:26,860
in also so basically here's what
happened right

906
01:03:26,860 --> 01:03:31,560
there's this thing called the DVD spec
right which was created to allow digital

907
01:03:31,560 --> 01:03:32,920
video discs

908
01:03:32,920 --> 01:03:36,590
which were a form of digital
entertainment they were plastic pieces

909
01:03:36,590 --> 01:03:37,610
have discs

910
01:03:37,610 --> 01:03:40,700
have to seize his son you're young

911
01:03:40,700 --> 01:03:43,780
and they basically allowed you to store
certain amount

912
01:03:43,780 --> 01:03:48,370
love material on them in a digital form
and and allow a relatively simple player

913
01:03:48,370 --> 01:03:49,250
at the time

914
01:03:49,250 --> 01:03:52,570
to be able to not just play it would be
able to read menus from it

915
01:03:52,570 --> 01:03:56,500
have subtitles do a bunch of different
video things and in theory

916
01:03:56,500 --> 01:04:01,330
the clarity was unbelievable in
heretofore unseen on earth

917
01:04:01,330 --> 01:04:05,010
and cheap to produce overtime well

918
01:04:05,010 --> 01:04:08,700
it depended on a protection scheme of
some sort %um

919
01:04:08,700 --> 01:04:12,600
mysterious and wonderful some sort of
black boxes at inside a chip and made it

920
01:04:12,600 --> 01:04:13,400
better

921
01:04:13,400 --> 01:04:16,440
on this you were bad and then it made it
worse

922
01:04:16,440 --> 01:04:21,250
and that's what it did and somebody
somebody came up with

923
01:04:21,250 --> 01:04:24,390
away to read it

924
01:04:24,390 --> 01:04:27,760
regardless so that quote unquote
protection given

925
01:04:27,760 --> 01:04:31,800
the reason given was P there's no good
DVD players for Linux

926
01:04:31,800 --> 01:04:36,540
soul you can't play DVD's on Linux let's
fix that

927
01:04:36,540 --> 01:04:40,700
and so over the course time this thing
came out and utility was created

928
01:04:40,700 --> 01:04:44,610
by a a young man gentleman arms
Johansson

929
01:04:44,610 --> 01:04:49,520
who be allowed you to do it was called
the ECSS utility because this was the

930
01:04:49,520 --> 01:04:51,710
content scrambling system

931
01:04:51,710 --> 01:04:54,750
fantastic name which enables you to
basically

932
01:04:54,750 --> 01:04:57,890
on isn't that great there it is

933
01:04:57,890 --> 01:05:01,110
flow blurry but there it is

934
01:05:01,110 --> 01:05:04,660
on this is the terrible thing you run it
and

935
01:05:04,660 --> 01:05:08,770
combined with other things it allows you
to read a DVD

936
01:05:08,770 --> 01:05:12,730
and not worry about the content
scrambling system

937
01:05:12,730 --> 01:05:15,990
the program is very small and was went
everywhere

938
01:05:15,990 --> 01:05:19,610
and when ended up happening was people

939
01:05:19,610 --> 01:05:23,210
arm put it everywhere

940
01:05:23,210 --> 01:05:26,630
cuz it was amazing and weird and
interesting I don't know many understood

941
01:05:26,630 --> 01:05:29,220
it but it went out there and went
everywhere

942
01:05:29,220 --> 01:05:33,460
and so as they say the movie studios did

943
01:05:33,460 --> 01:05:36,510
and they sued a few people forget

944
01:05:36,510 --> 01:05:41,210
and that was celebrated ohmygod with
piss them off

945
01:05:41,210 --> 01:05:44,860
and they sued a buncha people citing
been the newly minted

946
01:05:44,860 --> 01:05:49,140
you know Digital Millennium Copyright
Act 1998

947
01:05:49,140 --> 01:05:53,440
which enable a whole variety of things
to happen and

948
01:05:53,440 --> 01:05:56,670
this code was everywhere

949
01:05:56,670 --> 01:06:01,550
hosted everywhere including a 2600
magazine

950
01:06:01,550 --> 01:06:05,800
so to the movie studios sued

951
01:06:05,800 --> 01:06:09,910
a buncha people including Eric poorly
himself

952
01:06:09,910 --> 01:06:13,480
in his later his magazine 2600 for
having this

953
01:06:13,480 --> 01:06:16,990
they sought injunctive relief they
wanted many thousands of dollars and of

954
01:06:16,990 --> 01:06:19,050
course they wanted him permanently
banned from

955
01:06:19,050 --> 01:06:22,590
ever distributing this so he took it
down as per

956
01:06:22,590 --> 01:06:28,200
the request and instead replaced it with
the list of mirrors

957
01:06:28,200 --> 01:06:31,220
that's our that's our that's our manual

958
01:06:31,220 --> 01:06:34,600
just just kicks you in the balls while
being let out a club

959
01:06:34,600 --> 01:06:37,610
and so and ended up

960
01:06:37,610 --> 01:06:41,720
arm being linked and they sued him over
that they said you can even link to a

961
01:06:41,720 --> 01:06:44,320
thing that does something bad

962
01:06:44,320 --> 01:06:47,550
which was a very interesting innovation
legally

963
01:06:47,550 --> 01:06:51,480
and soul you know when you have a arm

964
01:06:51,480 --> 01:06:54,440
when you have a court case like that of
course it's got the geeks versus the old

965
01:06:54,440 --> 01:06:56,210
school versus everything else

966
01:06:56,210 --> 01:07:00,340
it was a six-day trial after months of
preparation

967
01:07:00,340 --> 01:07:03,340
and it was found to be

968
01:07:03,340 --> 01:07:08,400
not in 2600 favor are the other
defendants all settled

969
01:07:08,400 --> 01:07:11,570
2604 on as their what to do

970
01:07:11,570 --> 01:07:15,220
and they lost so they appealed anagram
decision

971
01:07:15,220 --> 01:07:18,700
they also agreed so the case was a

972
01:07:18,700 --> 01:07:22,860
lost it was a blow a against free speech
in some

973
01:07:22,860 --> 01:07:26,170
definitions it was definitely a blow
against 2600

974
01:07:26,170 --> 01:07:29,580
luckily there were no monetary damages
applied

975
01:07:29,580 --> 01:07:33,090
but the the check that the the judge in
a judge caplan in a

976
01:07:33,090 --> 01:07:36,660
eighty-plus page ruling which is in
there says basically

977
01:07:36,660 --> 01:07:40,010
no we have to mean

978
01:07:40,010 --> 01:07:45,250
Dean what the movies are because the
movies are very special

979
01:07:45,250 --> 01:07:51,750
no we don't want people to stop getting
movies about a guy looking at a girl

980
01:07:51,750 --> 01:07:54,870
now open about copyright I i mean you
know I love talking about that debate

981
01:07:54,870 --> 01:07:57,430
years in 1880 declaration of copyright

982
01:07:57,430 --> 01:08:03,040
on corn harvesters arm and a warning
against the people who are pirating corn

983
01:08:03,040 --> 01:08:04,680
harvesters

984
01:08:04,680 --> 01:08:08,320
arm don't do it only get the good ones

985
01:08:08,320 --> 01:08:11,560
you'll be liable for damages if you make
sell or use

986
01:08:11,560 --> 01:08:17,460
infringing machines that make corn

987
01:08:17,460 --> 01:08:21,420
so we've been angry a long time where
somebody goes black eye

988
01:08:21,420 --> 01:08:25,759
don't steal my shared I have a thing on
it that says no all

989
01:08:25,759 --> 01:08:29,070
we've been doing this a long time right

990
01:08:29,070 --> 01:08:33,780
on so the Digital Millennium Copyright
Act was simply an extension of that idea

991
01:08:33,780 --> 01:08:37,130
it said okay now there's all these
different things were going to do

992
01:08:37,130 --> 01:08:41,700
that our digital less weird wow you have
the ability to make something to

993
01:08:41,700 --> 01:08:45,839
because infinite copies of itself well
that break something

994
01:08:45,839 --> 01:08:48,890
you also have the ability for to be
perfect every time

995
01:08:48,890 --> 01:08:53,330
you have the ability for it to me past
everywhere simply

996
01:08:53,330 --> 01:08:58,580
well here's a bunch of laws saying thats
all kinda bad

997
01:08:58,580 --> 01:09:01,620
and it's been improved upon overtime

998
01:09:01,620 --> 01:09:04,750
you know in this country if you
videotape

999
01:09:04,750 --> 01:09:09,259
a movie well let's say you use a digital
camera but let's go with videotape it

1000
01:09:09,259 --> 01:09:13,710
like that better with C you take an RCA
Panasonic BHS

1001
01:09:13,710 --> 01:09:17,830
camera and you walk in a new record The
Expendables 3

1002
01:09:17,830 --> 01:09:21,089
and for some reason the gendarmes

1003
01:09:21,089 --> 01:09:25,540
in their little fuckin red vests walk up
and grab you

1004
01:09:25,540 --> 01:09:30,250
how many years you liable for

1005
01:09:30,250 --> 01:09:33,250
5 you get off easy yeah 5

1006
01:09:33,250 --> 01:09:38,049
record a movie by views jail two hundred
and fifty thousand dollar fine

1007
01:09:38,049 --> 01:09:41,410
that's very important to this country we
are a country where if you record

1008
01:09:41,410 --> 01:09:42,259
something

1009
01:09:42,259 --> 01:09:45,569
of a screen you're liable for five years

1010
01:09:45,569 --> 01:09:49,150
a prison 250,000 dollars

1011
01:09:49,150 --> 01:09:53,950
this must be really freakin important
this must be the golden child

1012
01:09:53,950 --> 01:09:57,840
ha it's because the Motion Picture
Association of America

1013
01:09:57,840 --> 01:10:01,050
arm they are they have a perfect right
to exist

1014
01:10:01,050 --> 01:10:04,540
and what they do when they get involved
in makes sense

1015
01:10:04,540 --> 01:10:08,150
what they are is all the motion picture
in hollywood

1016
01:10:08,150 --> 01:10:13,220
firms kinda don't like each other the
really kinda don't but they all agree

1017
01:10:13,220 --> 01:10:13,900
they have

1018
01:10:13,900 --> 01:10:17,640
things they agree upon that need to be
reinforced

1019
01:10:17,640 --> 01:10:21,780
and looked at in and and lobbied for but
the problem is is that

1020
01:10:21,780 --> 01:10:25,260
they never wanna sit in each other's god
damn office

1021
01:10:25,260 --> 01:10:29,980
so why not have an office that they all
agree that the listen to you

1022
01:10:29,980 --> 01:10:32,460
and that's the Motion Picture
Association of America they created the

1023
01:10:32,460 --> 01:10:34,400
rating system for instance

1024
01:10:34,400 --> 01:10:38,060
they were the ones who are your
certified different kinds of sound

1025
01:10:38,060 --> 01:10:41,660
the ones that dictate what the size of
the screen is they they they involve

1026
01:10:41,660 --> 01:10:42,840
themselves in all sorts of

1027
01:10:42,840 --> 01:10:46,540
intercompany processes in motion
pictures but they also deal in

1028
01:10:46,540 --> 01:10:48,330
enforcement

1029
01:10:48,330 --> 01:10:51,320
and they've gone a little more than
force mint they've actually worked into

1030
01:10:51,320 --> 01:10:52,240
going wow

1031
01:10:52,240 --> 01:10:57,060
this current society is not ready to
protect our stuff to the level we want

1032
01:10:57,060 --> 01:11:00,380
what can we do to warp reality to are

1033
01:11:00,380 --> 01:11:01,500
needs
