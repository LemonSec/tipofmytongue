1
00:00:00,149 --> 00:00:03,540
in so I'm over the last

2
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:07,190
I year and a half for sale you may have
noticed that there's been

3
00:00:07,190 --> 00:00:10,800
um some attention paid to big
adversaries

4
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:14,000
mmm-hmm he'd see my own flight I'm

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,240
so I'm in and yeah

6
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:20,869
and and what I love about this is how
much it kinda have the near each other

7
00:00:20,869 --> 00:00:22,160
very well I really like

8
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:25,430
you cannot speak its name no its not
returning

9
00:00:25,430 --> 00:00:29,470
it was good crushed by the church
committee in the seventies

10
00:00:29,470 --> 00:00:33,579
no no is overcome by the power the fis a

11
00:00:33,579 --> 00:00:36,820
but now it is turn the power the fines
and for is not

12
00:00:36,820 --> 00:00:40,870
it is very very Baltimore to shower
relationship for the NSA right now

13
00:00:40,870 --> 00:00:42,290
especially in this community

14
00:00:42,290 --> 00:00:46,070
but that for the both the same at a time

15
00:00:46,070 --> 00:00:50,930
I'm actually longer because these are
really like the amazingly powerful

16
00:00:50,930 --> 00:00:56,660
dangerous sexy adversaries that all
abuzz kind of in the action hero movie

17
00:00:56,660 --> 00:00:58,820
of our minds are up against

18
00:00:58,820 --> 00:01:03,730
I'm but I actually wanna get you through
what actually happens in Harry Potter a

19
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:04,510
little bit because

20
00:01:04,510 --> 00:01:08,080
he doesn't spend most of the time
fighting Voldemort

21
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:11,540
like at best is but a little bit
fighting his minions

22
00:01:11,540 --> 00:01:14,659
which might be like local law
enforcement

23
00:01:14,659 --> 00:01:17,700
bureaucracy this and

24
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:23,090
you know but really what spend most of
the time in most in stories doing

25
00:01:23,090 --> 00:01:27,850
he's playing but family in his peers

26
00:01:27,850 --> 00:01:33,220
and a administration staff and content
filtration

27
00:01:33,220 --> 00:01:36,759
and of course the IT department

28
00:01:36,759 --> 00:01:42,939
so what's a small

29
00:01:42,939 --> 00:01:47,640
adversary well small adversary is
someone that is out to stop you are out

30
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:50,500
to get you or something like that
doesn't have the

31
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:54,700
unlimited power and prestige in glory

32
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:59,140
I love what the NSA in the FBI and only
so there's three letter acronyms

33
00:01:59,140 --> 00:02:02,469
often when I'm thinking of modeling that
adversary I think of the great to

34
00:02:02,469 --> 00:02:03,810
database in the sky

35
00:02:03,810 --> 00:02:07,340
we're joins her and instantaneous and

36
00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:11,760
and all that information whether it's
like my transit card in my cell phone in

37
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:13,480
another can be instantly correlated

38
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:17,220
but the truth is most adversaries are
just jerks

39
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:20,739
on he and jerks

40
00:02:20,739 --> 00:02:25,770
our part in the Med adversary
environment as well because

41
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:30,319
I'm and I want this to stick in for the
everyone knows neck nick burns rate

42
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:34,040
like okay I can see the raise your hand
if you are Nick burns

43
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:38,480
and get like one or two hands addition
more view

44
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:42,360
face it in but them at

45
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:47,319
it the adversaries are not super
powerful sometimes they're not that

46
00:02:47,319 --> 00:02:48,069
smart

47
00:02:48,069 --> 00:02:52,440
but they are out to get you out to stop
you and am

48
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:56,510
and they can't quite dangerous I did
this cuz I will be gender balanced

49
00:02:56,510 --> 00:03:00,110
but I'm also OK saying most to the PP
people are white

50
00:03:00,110 --> 00:03:03,170
apparently month hmm

51
00:03:03,170 --> 00:03:07,080
but damn a but these adversaries

52
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:10,810
have am at very real a fax and the

53
00:03:10,810 --> 00:03:15,000
span all of our lives I you know it the
thing about the thing about small

54
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:15,959
adversaries

55
00:03:15,959 --> 00:03:19,060
is that only a few people really

56
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:22,819
in their day-to-day life worry about the
big adversaries but the small

57
00:03:22,819 --> 00:03:23,700
adversaries

58
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:26,799
target everyone on the planet

59
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:32,140
and they target everyone with whatever
technological means they have to hint

60
00:03:32,140 --> 00:03:37,709
sometimes and in you back in history
that was gossip the watering hole

61
00:03:37,709 --> 00:03:41,629
rate now its all sorts of things

62
00:03:41,629 --> 00:03:44,799
but let's let's talk about who real
quick before I go on

63
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:48,970
who the little adversaries are they can
be local policing be corrupt local

64
00:03:48,970 --> 00:03:50,260
police they can be

65
00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:55,060
you know a corrupt security guard on
they can be your IT department

66
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:58,670
if you are trying to whistle blow they
might be righty Department

67
00:03:58,670 --> 00:04:02,590
if you are trying to get a different job
they might also be righty Department

68
00:04:02,590 --> 00:04:06,530
on you're trying to commit and
industrial espionage

69
00:04:06,530 --> 00:04:10,150
still your ID Department from um

70
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:15,069
they are in corporations in schools and
organizations and even ngos

71
00:04:15,069 --> 00:04:17,560
these are things that are sometimes
trying to block you can stop you from

72
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:18,489
getting out the

73
00:04:18,489 --> 00:04:22,160
getting out your communication are going
to your information I'm

74
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:26,259
there in bureaucracies their skivvies I
mean

75
00:04:26,259 --> 00:04:29,949
I know that there's not a huge demand
respect for skis in this community but

76
00:04:29,949 --> 00:04:32,639
there should be a huge my respect for
the damage they can do because they're

77
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:33,660
so freakin

78
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:36,660
millennium them I'm

79
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:40,350
and their schools and their families
there

80
00:04:40,350 --> 00:04:44,070
their honor killings that there were
steered their partners that are

81
00:04:44,070 --> 00:04:45,949
committing to Mystic violence

82
00:04:45,949 --> 00:04:50,270
to partners than don't have the
information to get out to the situations

83
00:04:50,270 --> 00:04:54,470
I'm their friends that meanwhile

84
00:04:54,470 --> 00:04:59,520
and their stockers that don't mean well

85
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:03,259
on and sometimes they're just random
pony each

86
00:05:03,259 --> 00:05:06,550
and back and have a real you know
devastating effects on people's lives

87
00:05:06,550 --> 00:05:07,840
when the connection

88
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:12,220
when your grandmother has been owned by
that many botnet

89
00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:16,500
and she can't reach how it and
communicate with her family

90
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:19,550
hi solution has health consequences

91
00:05:19,550 --> 00:05:23,050
in later each these things are

92
00:05:23,050 --> 00:05:27,000
on can be can be quite powerful so what
are the tools a

93
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:31,160
a small adversaries well I mean physical
access is obviously one of them

94
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:34,210
one other major tools that we see with
Facebook

95
00:05:34,210 --> 00:05:39,030
and families is making you give up your
password

96
00:05:39,030 --> 00:05:43,389
that's a really important one I'm the
only other places we see that is

97
00:05:43,389 --> 00:05:46,770
Syria hun

98
00:05:46,770 --> 00:05:49,860
and I'd like to let that sink in for a
moment hmm

99
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:53,250
and the tactic the use in Syria has to
have more than one thing Facebook

100
00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:54,470
account

101
00:05:54,470 --> 00:05:58,280
now is that gonna come as a huge
surprise to teenagers out there that you

102
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:00,780
can do that

103
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:06,530
they can be like we've learned so much
from the Syrian resistance used

104
00:06:06,530 --> 00:06:10,229
on so there's all these coping
mechanisms we develop with our small

105
00:06:10,229 --> 00:06:11,190
adversaries

106
00:06:11,190 --> 00:06:14,470
and then there's the explicit tools in

107
00:06:14,470 --> 00:06:18,210
a lot less probably know these ones you
know this one was just in the news but

108
00:06:18,210 --> 00:06:18,780
there's

109
00:06:18,780 --> 00:06:21,910
plenty of other ones they're not
necessarily builders hacker tools but do

110
00:06:21,910 --> 00:06:23,669
eggs let's all be clear that

111
00:06:23,669 --> 00:06:28,370
RAM iraq's do the same thing with you
doing for greater evil they are exactly

112
00:06:28,370 --> 00:06:32,560
the same thing they are getting rude and
taking control it everything

113
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:36,610
on and and so that this is that this is
a more legitimate 10 that's got this

114
00:06:36,610 --> 00:06:39,639
page which I find hilarious

115
00:06:39,639 --> 00:06:43,889
that should take care of it ok

116
00:06:43,889 --> 00:06:48,560
network like the one person that just
still lapping

117
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:51,800
concludes you I V use the software

118
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:55,360
good I um and of course liking what

119
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:59,720
what are the ways that that term these
things get delivered with a mean way

120
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:00,870
that i've seen

121
00:07:00,870 --> 00:07:04,330
and and I should say a little bit about
where I come to from the Scot

122
00:07:04,330 --> 00:07:08,370
from the I come from for the stock maybe
early in the talk but here we are

123
00:07:08,370 --> 00:07:12,810
%uh where I come from this is that I
spend most my life working in the field

124
00:07:12,810 --> 00:07:14,080
as a journalist

125
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:17,599
and the people that I'm working with who
needs security tools

126
00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:22,150
don't need them in an academic way they
need something right now

127
00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:25,380
they may or may not have thought about
this in advance it's a real part of

128
00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:26,270
their life

129
00:07:26,270 --> 00:07:30,190
I have been on the phone to somebody
trying to stop them through how to do an

130
00:07:30,190 --> 00:07:32,229
open SSL

131
00:07:32,229 --> 00:07:36,660
command line to encrypt the file I don't
recommend boots

132
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:40,650
as a nonsignificant but when you got
nothing else

133
00:07:40,650 --> 00:07:44,530
and you know that it is something

134
00:07:44,530 --> 00:07:48,210
on so my knee perspective

135
00:07:48,210 --> 00:07:52,530
is a really deep practical one in at
some point in all this

136
00:07:52,530 --> 00:07:55,680
I will probably piss almost everyone in
this room of

137
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:58,970
because I'm specifically gonna try and
go after a lot of the security community

138
00:07:58,970 --> 00:08:00,580
sacred cows

139
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:04,440
I'm but term but will we see these

140
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:08,210
since we see them all over the place in
the thing is we also know

141
00:08:08,210 --> 00:08:11,550
that we aren't seeing most them so

142
00:08:11,550 --> 00:08:14,870
on power how are they getting to people
WBU

143
00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:18,030
they're getting to people via their
email a lot at the time sometimes its

144
00:08:18,030 --> 00:08:19,319
physical access

145
00:08:19,319 --> 00:08:22,509
at the heart email attachments

146
00:08:22,509 --> 00:08:27,470
and I am and I just wanna say about this
little fishing email that I didn't have

147
00:08:27,470 --> 00:08:29,460
anything for the slide

148
00:08:29,460 --> 00:08:35,740
and before my time and I just refresh my
mail three or four times

149
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:39,269
and then I had I'm actually chase
customer so

150
00:08:39,269 --> 00:08:42,510
potentially this was closer to hitting
the market and then many of them

151
00:08:42,510 --> 00:08:48,459
on so one of the things that turn that
we need to do is we need to fix the way

152
00:08:48,459 --> 00:08:49,470
email

153
00:08:49,470 --> 00:08:53,130
and attachments and those sorts of
channels make people tremendously

154
00:08:53,130 --> 00:08:56,420
vulnerable to small adversaries

155
00:08:56,420 --> 00:08:59,990
I'm how i know i mean the thing is the
tools

156
00:08:59,990 --> 00:09:05,990
are soo many and so terrible and they're
multiplying

157
00:09:05,990 --> 00:09:09,610
there's so much out there and and one of
the reasons why there's more tools and

158
00:09:09,610 --> 00:09:12,830
more tools and more towards coming up in
and I mean also

159
00:09:12,830 --> 00:09:15,990
not just tools in terms of like things
you can download and put onto your

160
00:09:15,990 --> 00:09:17,959
ex-girlfriend computer

161
00:09:17,959 --> 00:09:21,649
that's a thing but also ways of
monitoring things

162
00:09:21,649 --> 00:09:24,830
snooping suffer for your network
marketed to parents

163
00:09:24,830 --> 00:09:27,910
cuz only they would ever use it on

164
00:09:27,910 --> 00:09:31,700
censorship being rolled out at all sorts
of levels

165
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:36,230
not just national levels but also to
different levels the people hit

166
00:09:36,230 --> 00:09:40,200
home whether its libraries how homes
schools

167
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:43,490
cafes all sorts of stuff like that in

168
00:09:43,490 --> 00:09:47,459
what things where I want to relate this
back to Baltimore tennis hey real quick

169
00:09:47,459 --> 00:09:51,920
is that there's an ass about so below
effect here

170
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:56,750
I'm all these tools that eventually come
down to the small adversaries

171
00:09:56,750 --> 00:10:01,000
their modeled and developed in many ways
by the big adversaries

172
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:06,470
and that means they'll be more awesome
things to come

173
00:10:06,470 --> 00:10:11,190
it this is the best graphic on the
Internet by the way

174
00:10:11,190 --> 00:10:14,279
them I'm I'm

175
00:10:14,279 --> 00:10:18,019
so and whatever we have

176
00:10:18,019 --> 00:10:23,050
we will have dipshit ways if using bad
versions have it on each other

177
00:10:23,050 --> 00:10:26,600
I'm with in fairly short order and

178
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:30,899
and I do want you to sit with that for
mom n in your imagination and try to

179
00:10:30,899 --> 00:10:32,279
imagine what

180
00:10:32,279 --> 00:10:35,970
like the ghetto fabulous version like a
prism

181
00:10:35,970 --> 00:10:39,970
annex and excuse car looks like and
because

182
00:10:39,970 --> 00:10:43,690
somebody out there is going to be like
trying to figure had a beige box a fiber

183
00:10:43,690 --> 00:10:46,050
optics cable at some point

184
00:10:46,050 --> 00:10:50,510
on and then of course one of the major
problems when we start looking at at the

185
00:10:50,510 --> 00:10:51,839
way small adversaries

186
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:54,940
gain success and in attacking people

187
00:10:54,940 --> 00:11:00,610
is the user behaviors are terrible

188
00:11:00,610 --> 00:11:04,700
this is the second best picture on the
internet

189
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:11,690
up but I i and i wanna go back to that
like living in the practical work

190
00:11:11,690 --> 00:11:15,510
give me a moment them when I wanna go
back to that living in the practical

191
00:11:15,510 --> 00:11:16,720
world thing

192
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:21,240
which is the money in you this is
actually your job

193
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:26,850
so when you are choosing a long password
you are being paid to do that

194
00:11:26,850 --> 00:11:32,529
when I am choosing a long password I am
losing money to do that

195
00:11:32,529 --> 00:11:36,140
OPSEC makes you living OPSEC

196
00:11:36,140 --> 00:11:42,050
costs me mine if you don't work in
computers

197
00:11:42,050 --> 00:11:45,990
all this stuff takes away from your
productive time it takes away from your

198
00:11:45,990 --> 00:11:47,350
personal time

199
00:11:47,350 --> 00:11:51,209
it takes away from the few precious
moments you get to see your family

200
00:11:51,209 --> 00:11:54,410
before you go back to whatever it is you
do

201
00:11:54,410 --> 00:11:58,130
I it takes away from your life

202
00:11:58,130 --> 00:12:02,040
and I really need that to sink in to the
community have tool builders and

203
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:03,070
software

204
00:12:03,070 --> 00:12:06,160
that what makes your life

205
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:11,649
takes away other people's lives it takes
away their time

206
00:12:11,649 --> 00:12:15,700
and that doesn't necessarily mean that
the answers they should become more like

207
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:17,670
you

208
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:22,160
because you don't want to do their job

209
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:27,360
until you are ready to take your few
hours a week hauling trash

210
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:31,149
it is not your job to make the have a
trench roller like doing stuff where

211
00:12:31,149 --> 00:12:34,100
things

212
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:39,579
um we have specialization in this
civilization the mall for a reason

213
00:12:39,579 --> 00:12:42,970
and yes we need more dish a litter scene
that's and I and II

214
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:47,480
bang on about that endlessly we spend
twelve years teaching people how to read

215
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:52,779
and about 30 minutes teaching them how
to use computers that's not bright

216
00:12:52,779 --> 00:12:56,519
but its also not right for me to tell
everybody here that you should be

217
00:12:56,519 --> 00:13:01,510
producing thousands words a day because
I'm a writer why can't you do it

218
00:13:01,510 --> 00:13:04,529
cell there has to be a balance in their

219
00:13:04,529 --> 00:13:08,440
and where we come to the user

220
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:12,510
on we in the community have to
understand that

221
00:13:12,510 --> 00:13:15,810
operational security and encryption

222
00:13:15,810 --> 00:13:20,269
need to go to them am we can't make them
bring it to ass

223
00:13:20,269 --> 00:13:25,529
are that we can't bring them to you
where we're at and

224
00:13:25,529 --> 00:13:28,930
because I can't read my writing ima I

225
00:13:28,930 --> 00:13:34,149
because it it's not realistic and it's
not actually what we want

226
00:13:34,149 --> 00:13:37,930
when we think about doctors we think
about

227
00:13:37,930 --> 00:13:41,380
people who you the lawyers that are
trying to keep us at a prison

228
00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:45,110
not you when we think about all these
people who do these very very

229
00:13:45,110 --> 00:13:47,610
specialized important things in society

230
00:13:47,610 --> 00:13:53,070
do we were really to be really when our
doctor to drop everything and learn pgp

231
00:13:53,070 --> 00:13:58,440
in or do we actually want to take a
second look at that X-ray

232
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:02,519
I mean we got to think that the constant
these things you we all want lawyers to

233
00:14:02,519 --> 00:14:03,980
it to use encryption for

234
00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:08,699
pretty good reasons but obviously I've
had a lot of lawyers

235
00:14:08,699 --> 00:14:12,290
and I'd rather they fight about the law

236
00:14:12,290 --> 00:14:16,389
that's what I need them to do mom

237
00:14:16,389 --> 00:14:19,560
and they're still only 24 hours in a day
even

238
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:23,920
when your own lawyer good

239
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:26,980
but the billable at stir

240
00:14:26,980 --> 00:14:30,449
I'm so what is the cost of small
adversaries

241
00:14:30,449 --> 00:14:33,149
I mean we sit here and talk about the
ruination of society from large

242
00:14:33,149 --> 00:14:34,550
adversaries

243
00:14:34,550 --> 00:14:37,660
and that's true I'm not going to say
it's not

244
00:14:37,660 --> 00:14:42,380
but small adversaries are chump change
this is an estimate from one study

245
00:14:42,380 --> 00:14:45,850
the cost burden 45 billion a year

246
00:14:45,850 --> 00:14:49,750
and thats a the National

247
00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:53,730
external national debt both India

248
00:14:53,730 --> 00:14:58,120
plus enough to run the California School
System

249
00:14:58,120 --> 00:15:02,470
it a lot and I am this numbers not
terribly reliable but actually put much

250
00:15:02,470 --> 00:15:03,480
higher

251
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:06,660
not lower because there's dollar amounts
and then there's

252
00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:09,670
work time low cost on there's

253
00:15:09,670 --> 00:15:13,350
equipment replacements there's also to
think and equipment replacement happen

254
00:15:13,350 --> 00:15:14,860
within a need to you

255
00:15:14,860 --> 00:15:19,360
but I can once mom there's transit time
there's all this up

256
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:24,329
there's all that time where every
secretary or receptionist

257
00:15:24,329 --> 00:15:27,519
or support person in the world is going
we're is

258
00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:30,600
icon crap

259
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:34,130
month and then is time that comes out of
the

260
00:15:34,130 --> 00:15:38,180
you know the beautiful experiences being
human on this world

261
00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:41,519
that's what we're that's what we're
using our guitar are finite time in this

262
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:46,990
beautiful universe to do

263
00:15:46,990 --> 00:15:50,079
500,000 jobs in the US

264
00:15:50,079 --> 00:15:54,339
based on on to crashing businesses and
things like that again

265
00:15:54,339 --> 00:15:57,920
I i think there's a really interesting
figure in there in like jobs not created

266
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:01,089
by a lack of digital literacy in by the
fact the computers you're just not

267
00:16:01,089 --> 00:16:02,519
working

268
00:16:02,519 --> 00:16:06,130
for for most people computers just don't
work for most people

269
00:16:06,130 --> 00:16:09,570
on and securities part in that

270
00:16:09,570 --> 00:16:12,639
I'm reputations friendships

271
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:16,360
social connections lost as things get
compromised

272
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:19,949
when I went looking for a webcam nose
picking picture it was really hard to

273
00:16:19,949 --> 00:16:23,000
find one that had been blurred out

274
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:26,240
mmm and then it gets more serious

275
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:30,300
you know huge numbers in stocking

276
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:33,639
on and dad and victims are stocking

277
00:16:33,639 --> 00:16:37,079
deal with years have trauma on and then

278
00:16:37,079 --> 00:16:40,579
home be pain we've talked about lost
productivity

279
00:16:40,579 --> 00:16:45,540
but also dislike ongoing fear that is
connected with computers and with the

280
00:16:45,540 --> 00:16:47,560
small adversaries

281
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:51,060
are my parents watching me will my dad
catch me

282
00:16:51,060 --> 00:16:55,410
what will my school think will my peers
humiliate me

283
00:16:55,410 --> 00:16:58,420
just constant life fear

284
00:16:58,420 --> 00:17:02,370
and stress and ultimately deaths

285
00:17:02,370 --> 00:17:06,480
I'm nobody has a wave cap have counting
how many appliance

286
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:10,220
didn't were ruined by not be able to get
to censor information

287
00:17:10,220 --> 00:17:14,419
how many kids killed themselves because
they couldn't find resources online

288
00:17:14,419 --> 00:17:17,890
how many people couldn't find medical
information that they need

289
00:17:17,890 --> 00:17:21,110
how many people her at were harassed
into suicide

290
00:17:21,110 --> 00:17:26,049
on how much malfunctioning year has
caused death how many people stabbing at

291
00:17:26,049 --> 00:17:27,220
their phone

292
00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:32,289
not trying to tax but just trying to get
it to work you got hit by a car or

293
00:17:32,289 --> 00:17:35,450
job when someone and ultimately

294
00:17:35,450 --> 00:17:40,070
I a vehicle for intimate murder does
honor killings those

295
00:17:40,070 --> 00:17:45,559
domestic murders I'm children and
parents and brothers and sisters and

296
00:17:45,559 --> 00:17:46,730
friends

297
00:17:46,730 --> 00:17:51,090
and ending terribly because

298
00:17:51,090 --> 00:17:57,510
there technology either enabled the
wrong behavior got in their way

299
00:17:57,510 --> 00:18:01,220
so how do we make things better now that
I'm

300
00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:04,299
got you into a big downer weapon

301
00:18:04,299 --> 00:18:09,320
and you know them we're starting to
smack some stabs at this I'm hearing

302
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:13,429
I i've been interested in user interface
is open source offer since the 90's and

303
00:18:13,429 --> 00:18:15,070
believe me there is an on rewarding

304
00:18:15,070 --> 00:18:20,840
interest but I'm seeing movement in the
right direction I'm seeing people start

305
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:21,710
to care

306
00:18:21,710 --> 00:18:25,679
still think it's actually kind of messed
up in its priorities but i wanna give a

307
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:28,610
a few examples in the things I like i
won when I like them and then I want to

308
00:18:28,610 --> 00:18:30,460
get my heretical statements

309
00:18:30,460 --> 00:18:35,419
one one piece for 1p secure that I've
worked on

310
00:18:35,419 --> 00:18:39,840
had my set when is he worked on me.
loosely I don't code

311
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:44,220
I have coded didn't pass I found it damn
painful and annoying

312
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:47,289
and decided I would just do other things

313
00:18:47,289 --> 00:18:51,549
from I'm but but I helped design the
system

314
00:18:51,549 --> 00:18:56,039
and this is called the kitten humor
because somebody let me in a min

315
00:18:56,039 --> 00:18:59,750
hmm it has another name in its more

316
00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:03,669
in its other legitimate fork but I'm not
even saying it because kitten dreamers

317
00:19:03,669 --> 00:19:05,230
better

318
00:19:05,230 --> 00:19:09,870
on and now and the way this works and
we're still working out the bugs

319
00:19:09,870 --> 00:19:14,840
oddly enough is that you get a USB and
you just don't know about that USB

320
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:19,530
because reasons and I'm and we've got a
little Raspberry Pi hearing it's running

321
00:19:19,530 --> 00:19:20,910
a Debian system

322
00:19:20,910 --> 00:19:25,440
with I LibreOffice in a few other pieces
of software on it you plug your USB into

323
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:26,390
the top

324
00:19:26,390 --> 00:19:29,850
you plug a clean clear big enough USB

325
00:19:29,850 --> 00:19:34,280
into the bonham with nothing on it and
you put this lil guy and in

326
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:35,179
automatically

327
00:19:35,179 --> 00:19:38,620
it's gonna take the content to the top
trying clean them up

328
00:19:38,620 --> 00:19:41,690
make sure you've got miss no system
Polytechnic honor and something like

329
00:19:41,690 --> 00:19:43,340
that

330
00:19:43,340 --> 00:19:46,820
and and and trance that kinda bad

331
00:19:46,820 --> 00:19:50,200
use file format transfers to try and get
ready for anything that's

332
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:53,880
excessively turning complete in your
documents

333
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:57,190
I'm it's gonna take the out the
resulting files copy it to the bottom

334
00:19:57,190 --> 00:20:00,610
one and that's the one you put in your
laptop

335
00:20:00,610 --> 00:20:04,559
when it is done working it either it
finishes for I'm flashing

336
00:20:04,559 --> 00:20:10,330
or plays a little song that's it there's
no other interface

337
00:20:10,330 --> 00:20:14,309
the idea is to make something that like
anyone who gets a lot a USB is can just

338
00:20:14,309 --> 00:20:15,270
like this n

339
00:20:15,270 --> 00:20:18,830
wat unplug it go

340
00:20:18,830 --> 00:20:22,870
we don't destroy the original
information because the first priority

341
00:20:22,870 --> 00:20:23,590
and

342
00:20:23,590 --> 00:20:26,620
everyone in this system even you

343
00:20:26,620 --> 00:20:29,950
is to get your friggin work done

344
00:20:29,950 --> 00:20:33,309
and that means if my a security measure
gets in the way of your work you will

345
00:20:33,309 --> 00:20:36,070
find a way around it because you have to

346
00:20:36,070 --> 00:20:39,200
because getting your work done is more
important than the Securities

347
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:44,480
and you agree even if you don't agree
you agree because you still want your

348
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:46,750
doctor to look at your X-ray

349
00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:50,900
and you still want your lawyer to think
about keeping you have jail

350
00:20:50,900 --> 00:20:56,039
mom so this was this low interfaces we
could make a physical item for cleaning

351
00:20:56,039 --> 00:20:57,190
up US peace

352
00:20:57,190 --> 00:21:02,130
eventually I'd like to to use the same
sir techniques on email

353
00:21:02,130 --> 00:21:05,809
I'd like to get those links out as being
links

354
00:21:05,809 --> 00:21:10,090
and expose their your else write in the
email think that we do a great deal to

355
00:21:10,090 --> 00:21:14,789
reduce fishing I'd love her cleanup
email attachments

356
00:21:14,789 --> 00:21:19,210
and but we can't make original content
unavailable because thats

357
00:21:19,210 --> 00:21:22,760
taking the me that that's not coming to
the user that's trying to make these are

358
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:24,230
gonna pass

359
00:21:24,230 --> 00:21:27,400
um so some the ones that I recommend

360
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:30,770
were at least like in certain ways in
certain ways different

361
00:21:30,770 --> 00:21:34,850
I'm a few icons here I'm could have
filled this with different things and

362
00:21:34,850 --> 00:21:36,130
talk about each one of them

363
00:21:36,130 --> 00:21:41,010
but I wanted to pick actually from a few
different kind of controversial in some

364
00:21:41,010 --> 00:21:41,770
software

365
00:21:41,770 --> 00:21:45,270
on a silent circle

366
00:21:45,270 --> 00:21:48,890
very well considered interfaces to sell
in circles

367
00:21:48,890 --> 00:21:52,900
on software and they're black foam arm
its

368
00:21:52,900 --> 00:21:56,880
semi open source which for many people
means not open source for legitimate

369
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:57,770
reasons

370
00:21:57,770 --> 00:22:03,230
on at harvard is guided it will come
back to that later

371
00:22:03,230 --> 00:22:07,120
paid hmmm a but to

372
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:10,370
it's sad it's really nice to use

373
00:22:10,370 --> 00:22:13,480
like it's pleasant to use pretty much as
soon as you make

374
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:17,440
security suffer pleasant to use I'm
probably going to buy you a cupcake for

375
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:18,860
your birthday

376
00:22:18,860 --> 00:22:21,870
I'm real happy about that on

377
00:22:21,870 --> 00:22:24,630
crypto cannot imagine if you if you know
know that there's been a little

378
00:22:24,630 --> 00:22:27,580
controversial era cryptic at over the
years

379
00:22:27,580 --> 00:22:31,650
on but but I've always felt it was a
gorgeous piece of software

380
00:22:31,650 --> 00:22:34,659
in a 3-1 reasons I feel like it's
gorgeous because

381
00:22:34,659 --> 00:22:37,909
I have discovered that somebody in

382
00:22:37,909 --> 00:22:42,140
our country very far away in the Middle
Eastern Asia

383
00:22:42,140 --> 00:22:45,950
now we're even Africa or sometimes even
Australia

384
00:22:45,950 --> 00:22:49,860
on I can get onto the phone with them

385
00:22:49,860 --> 00:22:53,429
and be this can be somebody who's
literally afraid of their computer

386
00:22:53,429 --> 00:22:59,500
okay and within a few min minutes I can
get them using crypto ca

387
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:04,140
that is amazing there has never been
security software

388
00:23:04,140 --> 00:23:07,390
that I could do that with and I have
tried it all

389
00:23:07,390 --> 00:23:10,640
I'm and from crypto cannot I can get
them

390
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:15,190
interested in secure suffer a major
Middle Eastern news outlet

391
00:23:15,190 --> 00:23:19,539
that you have heard have a which I guess
nails it down

392
00:23:19,539 --> 00:23:23,340
baby hmmm I was getting one of their

393
00:23:23,340 --> 00:23:27,929
when their reporters on two cryptic at
and and and she told me

394
00:23:27,929 --> 00:23:31,720
over kept a captain her managing editor
had walked by said what is that

395
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:34,750
she explained it and he said wow

396
00:23:34,750 --> 00:23:40,010
we gotta learn more about the no one in
the history and history has ever walked

397
00:23:40,010 --> 00:23:43,760
by PGP and said please

398
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:49,929
tell me more about what you're doing

399
00:23:49,929 --> 00:23:53,679
on I Hitchin is a classic example

400
00:23:53,679 --> 00:23:58,159
where we as a community can ago wrong
around this death because we're like

401
00:23:58,159 --> 00:23:59,870
pidgin it has 0 TR

402
00:23:59,870 --> 00:24:05,360
and it's not at all built on bad
software in any way

403
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:11,270
at its worst script ok had never
compromise your whole damn machine

404
00:24:11,270 --> 00:24:18,110
on n but again once I got critic at is
great for getting people on a pigeon

405
00:24:18,110 --> 00:24:22,260
as well that's your goal starry cryptic
at me like

406
00:24:22,260 --> 00:24:25,539
so there's a thing that makes this even
easier you lie

407
00:24:25,539 --> 00:24:29,000
and ok know it's cool

408
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:33,010
stay with me I'm gooden download this
and then

409
00:24:33,010 --> 00:24:36,679
um and then turn off logging and we'll
get to that because when we're talking a

410
00:24:36,679 --> 00:24:37,909
small adversaries

411
00:24:37,909 --> 00:24:41,630
and I guess we get to the right now I
want to have a small adversaries we

412
00:24:41,630 --> 00:24:44,860
spend a lot of time going on about
encryption

413
00:24:44,860 --> 00:24:49,460
but encryption doesn't actually manner
for most small adversaries

414
00:24:49,460 --> 00:24:53,700
your dad is not at the router breaking
your encryption

415
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:56,700
that's not usually what happens

416
00:24:56,700 --> 00:25:00,070
on even yankee Department isn't breaking
your encryption

417
00:25:00,070 --> 00:25:04,010
their going through your alarm clocks

418
00:25:04,010 --> 00:25:07,210
creating software that doesn't belong

419
00:25:07,210 --> 00:25:10,600
pat would be such a win people

420
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:15,090
getting people to turn off like turning
off logging by default

421
00:25:15,090 --> 00:25:18,450
because longues are everywhere and logs

422
00:25:18,450 --> 00:25:22,220
wide marquee

423
00:25:22,220 --> 00:25:25,270
nobody has to break your caption they
already there were no

424
00:25:25,270 --> 00:25:30,640
all is and there's baby many variations
in this world on the rubber hose

425
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:35,320
am so my biggest problem with teaching
people pigeon

426
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:39,150
a decides home key management

427
00:25:39,150 --> 00:25:42,679
%um them my other biggest problem with
using people billion

428
00:25:42,679 --> 00:25:46,669
is making sure they turn up liking

429
00:25:46,669 --> 00:25:52,779
its remote its obscure its difficult but
I don't care how well in crypto TR is

430
00:25:52,779 --> 00:25:56,950
if you save it on your machine and
officer Doohickey from

431
00:25:56,950 --> 00:26:00,220
you know the next county over manages to
get his

432
00:26:00,220 --> 00:26:03,409
you know his cousin the judge to issue a
warrant you are

433
00:26:03,409 --> 00:26:06,620
fucked from

434
00:26:06,620 --> 00:26:10,070
so don't say blocks ensure I'm but that
gets me

435
00:26:10,070 --> 00:26:14,370
my my last I can hear snapchat which I'm
sure all are you using appreciate

436
00:26:14,370 --> 00:26:18,520
on but one thing I love about snapchat

437
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:21,919
is looks the way it sets users
expectations

438
00:26:21,919 --> 00:26:25,110
and it turns out a huge many people when
you tell them look

439
00:26:25,110 --> 00:26:28,480
hear something that mean defining
features it doesn't mark

440
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:31,590
like a massive user base is going

441
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:34,860
sign me up for that a much more massive
one then

442
00:26:34,860 --> 00:26:39,070
even happened in the security community
like pat's actually

443
00:26:39,070 --> 00:26:43,120
a natural response to wanting to not
keep data that can hurt you in the

444
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:44,650
future

445
00:26:44,650 --> 00:26:49,360
so as a community people interested in
operation security should be supporting

446
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:50,760
snap chap

447
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:53,950
rather than what they do because

448
00:26:53,950 --> 00:26:58,580
the expectations it sets with people are
so fantastic

449
00:26:58,580 --> 00:27:01,720
so if you come and say well snapchat
great

450
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:05,130
doesn't quite work right

451
00:27:05,130 --> 00:27:08,159
but now that you want backed

452
00:27:08,159 --> 00:27:14,419
now that you expect let's talk about
some here other options

453
00:27:14,419 --> 00:27:17,510
one of the keys to spreading Inc
encryption around and I have done this a

454
00:27:17,510 --> 00:27:18,320
lot

455
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:22,580
is am identifying your gateway drugs
that

456
00:27:22,580 --> 00:27:27,130
I really do understand

457
00:27:27,130 --> 00:27:30,169
that bad encryption software as bad

458
00:27:30,169 --> 00:27:35,429
on I'm not I I'm not blind to the fact
that breakable and

459
00:27:35,429 --> 00:27:38,710
and bad in encryption is not well
implemented

460
00:27:38,710 --> 00:27:42,580
is something that hurts people it hurts
people every day

461
00:27:42,580 --> 00:27:46,690
but not using encryption hurts more

462
00:27:46,690 --> 00:27:50,870
on and it hurts a lot more of them
because there's so many of these little

463
00:27:50,870 --> 00:27:51,880
adversaries

464
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:55,960
on and I'm gonna go ahead and

465
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:59,330
and say the first my heretical
statements on

466
00:27:59,330 --> 00:28:02,669
because it's not in anyway it all
heretical outsiders

467
00:28:02,669 --> 00:28:06,340
by the security community in south where
the restive south where where

468
00:28:06,340 --> 00:28:09,659
once upon a time I worked this is just
understood

469
00:28:09,659 --> 00:28:13,250
which is you can never fix the front end

470
00:28:13,250 --> 00:28:17,440
you can always 6 back and if you

471
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:20,480
if you're truly shitty can crips nap
gets users

472
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:25,539
we can fix the encryption we can fix the
design

473
00:28:25,539 --> 00:28:28,789
but if you're truly beautiful ap

474
00:28:28,789 --> 00:28:32,960
never gets new users we can't fix the

475
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:36,330
they're always be bugs they're always
need to be fixes

476
00:28:36,330 --> 00:28:39,730
and that's pretty bizarre expectation
and that's good but

477
00:28:39,730 --> 00:28:44,039
you i nie you are my is hard to come
back from

478
00:28:44,039 --> 00:28:47,529
and even when there's pitfalls

479
00:28:47,529 --> 00:28:52,289
in the back side we can often steer ban
users around them with the you

480
00:28:52,289 --> 00:28:56,529
user interface you can actually fix bad
back ends with good you eyes

481
00:28:56,529 --> 00:29:00,399
you can never fix you eyes with a really
really amazing back and

482
00:29:00,399 --> 00:29:07,399
are you get to his failure faster

483
00:29:09,570 --> 00:29:13,350
I guess it wasn't that a radical did on

484
00:29:13,350 --> 00:29:16,929
deep

485
00:29:16,929 --> 00:29:20,850
I'm gonna confess that this is their
partly cuz I really love it

486
00:29:20,850 --> 00:29:25,559
the on at the other thing that damn

487
00:29:25,559 --> 00:29:28,909
that has upset many people when I've
been in in Twitter discussions for

488
00:29:28,909 --> 00:29:29,409
instance

489
00:29:29,409 --> 00:29:33,320
I'm about the nature of encryption is
what the goal is

490
00:29:33,320 --> 00:29:36,429
because the goal of people writing
security software

491
00:29:36,429 --> 00:29:40,750
or suffer they want to be secure is for
to be unbreakable

492
00:29:40,750 --> 00:29:44,270
the goal in the world is not to be
unbreakable it's not to be

493
00:29:44,270 --> 00:29:47,370
uncatchable it's not be unstoppable

494
00:29:47,370 --> 00:29:50,820
it's to be unbroken uncaught in on
stopped

495
00:29:50,820 --> 00:29:54,059
these are really different goals

496
00:29:54,059 --> 00:29:58,149
if you're amazing encryption on

497
00:29:58,149 --> 00:30:02,299
and my knee Caesar cipher

498
00:30:02,299 --> 00:30:06,100
both by me the same 20 minutes I need to
get my neck safehouse

499
00:30:06,100 --> 00:30:10,029
there exactly equivalent

500
00:30:10,029 --> 00:30:14,470
it doesn't matter which 1i use it my
goal

501
00:30:14,470 --> 00:30:17,730
is that I need 20 min minutes in the
person I'm sending it two dozen in

502
00:30:17,730 --> 00:30:18,770
person his

503
00:30:18,770 --> 00:30:22,990
in EVE doesn't know the Caesar cipher
were cool

504
00:30:22,990 --> 00:30:27,510
when the reasons why when I am in the
real world and talking to people with

505
00:30:27,510 --> 00:30:31,779
needs to hide things from adversaries I
spend a lot of time talking about

506
00:30:31,779 --> 00:30:36,370
I social coding such technology things
things you can do in your speech

507
00:30:36,370 --> 00:30:40,220
to obscure meaning to buyers of time
stuff like that

508
00:30:40,220 --> 00:30:44,460
incredibly powerful social techniques
for not getting caught

509
00:30:44,460 --> 00:30:48,809
for not getting stopped and you all know
this from every time you can stop

510
00:30:48,809 --> 00:30:50,760
speeding

511
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:54,279
because you're gonna come up with coded
language in that situation

512
00:30:54,279 --> 00:30:57,529
you're not like Wat I can go back in the
past in jam your

513
00:30:57,529 --> 00:31:01,820
your your radar you're gonna switch to
social coding in a hurry

514
00:31:01,820 --> 00:31:05,140
in that situation you have been pot I'm

515
00:31:05,140 --> 00:31:08,990
and thats actually I think that's the
most common place where most people in

516
00:31:08,990 --> 00:31:09,679
society

517
00:31:09,679 --> 00:31:14,010
encounter the need to switch to social
coding in a hurry because they've been

518
00:31:14,010 --> 00:31:16,580
caught because their method has failed

519
00:31:16,580 --> 00:31:20,029
is trying to talk their way out of a
speeding ticket

520
00:31:20,029 --> 00:31:24,159
and then what you think about that when
you think about like how people use

521
00:31:24,159 --> 00:31:25,039
Facebook

522
00:31:25,039 --> 00:31:28,789
to organize things the kind of
continually in this process of finding

523
00:31:28,789 --> 00:31:31,649
ways to talk around the things that they
need to

524
00:31:31,649 --> 00:31:34,950
to create the kind of social
manipulation they want

525
00:31:34,950 --> 00:31:39,070
without the two technical tools to help
them

526
00:31:39,070 --> 00:31:41,890
there's a thing I used to say it a lot
of these conferences which is that thing

527
00:31:41,890 --> 00:31:42,789
that you call

528
00:31:42,789 --> 00:31:49,789
and social engineering the rest risk our
conversation

529
00:31:50,559 --> 00:31:54,840
ok Lamba free crap I was Dissidia

530
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:58,080
you from third-term

531
00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:03,039
I'm but it's true that we do need to
talk about like where these things did

532
00:32:03,039 --> 00:32:05,019
into our security landscapes

533
00:32:05,019 --> 00:32:09,240
not just in terms of penetration which
has been the sexy thing for most of my

534
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:13,210
life but in terms of like where it fits
into defense

535
00:32:13,210 --> 00:32:18,169
where we are looking for ways to defend
people through their language usage in

536
00:32:18,169 --> 00:32:20,470
to help them understand how to do that

537
00:32:20,470 --> 00:32:24,700
come so my my heretical statement just
go back then

538
00:32:24,700 --> 00:32:28,909
is is uncatchable is no better than
uncut

539
00:32:28,909 --> 00:32:32,799
and that means that if you're shady ass
tool will not stop the NSA

540
00:32:32,799 --> 00:32:38,000
but you know it's your ex-boyfriend
who's a problem

541
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:41,620
then that it's very simple the race
before chart does your ex-boyfriend work

542
00:32:41,620 --> 00:32:46,240
for the NSA yes or no

543
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:51,019
ok there's another talk for that same
afternoon

544
00:32:51,019 --> 00:32:55,049
I'm and cell

545
00:32:55,049 --> 00:32:59,870
is me on we need to create more
attractive options

546
00:32:59,870 --> 00:33:04,059
create sometimes not necessarily great
working options but we need to make it

547
00:33:04,059 --> 00:33:05,190
human

548
00:33:05,190 --> 00:33:09,269
we needed to hate shitty software that
people I can make it better

549
00:33:09,269 --> 00:33:12,760
we need to do more on these things in
the great words of George Michael

550
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:17,380
I'll we need to take these lies and make
them true

551
00:33:17,380 --> 00:33:21,149
we need to make the lives snapchat true
I'm

552
00:33:21,149 --> 00:33:24,799
because the lie is really useful goal

553
00:33:24,799 --> 00:33:29,070
and we need to bear that in mind when we
go on our Twitter tirade about it

554
00:33:29,070 --> 00:33:33,149
Tom so what do we need what do we really
need to make this world a better place

555
00:33:33,149 --> 00:33:33,679
for

556
00:33:33,679 --> 00:33:36,880
most to the people who were who are
struggling and small adversaries

557
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:40,330
huge man at the time I'm I'll

558
00:33:40,330 --> 00:33:44,190
we need more to factor authentication we
need more tools for it

559
00:33:44,190 --> 00:33:49,080
on I do so that they can be deployed all
over services not just the big ones

560
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:52,940
I'm and they need to not just be bound a
big players we needn't

561
00:33:52,940 --> 00:33:56,490
we need more small to tools that way we
need more auditing

562
00:33:56,490 --> 00:34:00,860
I'm gonna go ahead and say on one other
things

563
00:34:00,860 --> 00:34:04,120
that that has gotten into trouble
recently which is that your

564
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:08,060
on our did open source software is no
but better than somebody else's I did a

565
00:34:08,060 --> 00:34:11,470
close source software in fact it's
probably worse

566
00:34:11,470 --> 00:34:15,129
if no one I know that all we know is
sufficient eyes may call back shallow

567
00:34:15,129 --> 00:34:16,950
but you don't have sufficient

568
00:34:16,950 --> 00:34:21,510
I is if no one's looking you and we've
just been living through this is a

569
00:34:21,510 --> 00:34:24,520
little much less controversial
contention than it was before heart

570
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:25,040
bleed

571
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:28,520
month hmm we all did have a collective
moment going

572
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:32,659
a hoe yes we probably should have done
month

573
00:34:32,659 --> 00:34:36,419
I am her so we need we need more
auditing

574
00:34:36,419 --> 00:34:40,320
we need more open source owning and when
you're close source I think I mean

575
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:42,970
ultimately my goal is to keep my
friend's alive

576
00:34:42,970 --> 00:34:46,139
not to win one particular faction in the
software war I would

577
00:34:46,139 --> 00:34:50,290
I actually prefer open source but its
secondary keeping my friend's alive

578
00:34:50,290 --> 00:34:55,250
none

579
00:34:55,250 --> 00:34:58,589
we need more bad tools and then we need
to fix the

580
00:34:58,589 --> 00:35:02,230
we need to get more things in front of
more people

581
00:35:02,230 --> 00:35:05,420
get more feedback on them see how people
want to use them

582
00:35:05,420 --> 00:35:08,920
get people using things that's the great
thing about what's happened and

583
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:12,720
snap technologies are things that people
are using these tools in their teaching

584
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:13,950
us what they want

585
00:35:13,950 --> 00:35:16,960
and we need to bring in corruption to
them which is one reason I wanna call

586
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:17,849
out real quick

587
00:35:17,849 --> 00:35:21,130
on the the great work in a team did with
crypto cat

588
00:35:21,130 --> 00:35:28,130
plugging in the face but chap that was
potentially a million person when there

589
00:35:30,570 --> 00:35:33,839
Facebook south at coming

590
00:35:33,839 --> 00:35:37,160
but you know big ups for trying

591
00:35:37,160 --> 00:35:40,550
I'm we need more in apt user education

592
00:35:40,550 --> 00:35:44,270
we need applications to teach users
what's happening

593
00:35:44,270 --> 00:35:47,829
and give them agency we need to give
them the choice to not click on fishing

594
00:35:47,829 --> 00:35:48,680
links

595
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:52,640
needed we need a way to say hey this
week goes here is that what you want

596
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:56,260
we need to involve the user in the
process more we need to involve users

597
00:35:56,260 --> 00:35:58,310
and security not just in choices

598
00:35:58,310 --> 00:36:01,380
not just in their consumption choices
but also as

599
00:36:01,380 --> 00:36:04,460
and Agentur incredible knowledge

600
00:36:04,460 --> 00:36:07,589
you know you know the thing that knows
whether or not

601
00:36:07,589 --> 00:36:11,480
this computer should Beach streaming
video right now is not the router

602
00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:14,730
it's not the network it's not a a cloud
service

603
00:36:14,730 --> 00:36:20,410
it's not anything on here it's me out we
need to start using the amazing

604
00:36:20,410 --> 00:36:23,780
complex pattern matchers attached to all
these computers

605
00:36:23,780 --> 00:36:28,010
then we need ultimately

606
00:36:28,010 --> 00:36:31,869
on to teach users that their powerful

607
00:36:31,869 --> 00:36:35,680
and we haven't done and that's really

608
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:39,369
really what's going to help us against
small adversaries

609
00:36:39,369 --> 00:36:42,800
is empowering our users giving them
choices

610
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:46,890
and giving them agency giving them
knowledge bringing all these things to

611
00:36:46,890 --> 00:36:47,490
them

612
00:36:47,490 --> 00:36:50,750
and letting them make the choices that
are right for their situations

613
00:36:50,750 --> 00:36:55,099
because you don't know if I need to
resist the NSA or get to a safe house in

614
00:36:55,099 --> 00:36:56,369
20 minutes

615
00:36:56,369 --> 00:37:02,099
I know that I just need the tools that
let me make this choice is better

616
00:37:02,099 --> 00:37:06,000
and ultimately this is gonna go back to
the big adversaries

617
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:09,839
because if you want to fight Voldemort

618
00:37:09,839 --> 00:37:16,790
slash NSA you're gonna need the users to
feel that they are powerful

619
00:37:16,790 --> 00:37:20,700
you gonna need all of them to feel
powerful enough to fight back

620
00:37:20,700 --> 00:37:25,570
and not the way people feel now which is
scared if their computers

621
00:37:25,570 --> 00:37:30,660
and scared small adversaries and
helpless and hopeless invasiveness

622
00:37:30,660 --> 00:37:37,050
once they're empowered baltimore's gonna
go down like a little bitch

623
00:37:37,050 --> 00:37:41,660
until then its you versus the Dark Lord
of the NSA

624
00:37:41,660 --> 00:37:45,060
and the odds don't look great right

625
00:37:45,060 --> 00:37:51,720
thank you very much and i'm happy to
take questions

626
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:58,720
spread like I'm a little late from here

627
00:38:00,839 --> 00:38:05,839
ago there's so many %uh view I only saw
like four people here

628
00:38:05,839 --> 00:38:12,839
I thought I was alone except for like
that one guy laughing really happy

629
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:17,450
is that he's in here or am I just going
blind

630
00:38:17,450 --> 00:38:20,450
okay I think it's just staring into the
spotlights okay that was my question to

631
00:38:20,450 --> 00:38:20,829
you

632
00:38:20,829 --> 00:38:27,829
now I'm telling the truth if you like
that question come right up to this Mike

633
00:38:34,510 --> 00:38:38,119
I think really rips careful to leave
room for questions but I can babble more

634
00:38:38,119 --> 00:38:39,839
exacting a potom

635
00:38:39,839 --> 00:38:42,990
them I'm comes rise only have any
questions plane thanks on your time

636
00:38:42,990 --> 00:38:46,950
awesome talk and I feel very much the
same way Mike the real problems we have

637
00:38:46,950 --> 00:38:51,190
are the abusive husbands they aren't the
vindictive teachers data

638
00:38:51,190 --> 00:38:54,820
rain and and actually don't have a
question I just wanted to make the point

639
00:38:54,820 --> 00:38:56,220
that there's a nice follow-on

640
00:38:56,220 --> 00:38:59,680
a fact to getting everyone to use crappy
tools that do

641
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:04,060
anything a rising tide raises all boats

642
00:39:04,060 --> 00:39:07,540
right the more expensive the more time
it takes to deal with any the

643
00:39:07,540 --> 00:39:09,510
communication on the network

644
00:39:09,510 --> 00:39:13,609
the more time the chuckle heads at the
top who want to read everything have to

645
00:39:13,609 --> 00:39:14,390
spend

646
00:39:14,390 --> 00:39:18,950
doing their day job rain in only helps
even if we get everybody on snapchat

647
00:39:18,950 --> 00:39:23,119
that's a win rain so you can call that
out explicitly but was all over the edge

648
00:39:23,119 --> 00:39:24,880
as you're talking I wanted to see it
that way

649
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:28,890
something so I made the mic I did

650
00:39:28,890 --> 00:39:32,550
I didn't say one time years ago that if
we wanted to shut down the NSA which is

651
00:39:32,550 --> 00:39:39,099
an all their data one day in different
formats including palestinians

652
00:39:39,099 --> 00:39:42,849
great time I a suggestion for all you

653
00:39:42,849 --> 00:39:46,400
in in now I you hope you are

654
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:49,609
acumen happy to talk so you may have
already said this

655
00:39:49,609 --> 00:39:52,710
on but in relation to small adversaries

656
00:39:52,710 --> 00:39:57,410
sometimes asking the user for password
is the last thing you want to do

657
00:39:57,410 --> 00:40:00,660
so we need more creativity around

658
00:40:00,660 --> 00:40:05,220
security that looks really normal
security should be something

659
00:40:05,220 --> 00:40:09,800
that doesn't look scary and doesn't look
like the user

660
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:13,280
is trying to give the authority the No

661
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:17,500
the middle finger some yeah I I do think
and one of the big ones historically

662
00:40:17,500 --> 00:40:18,829
from this was SSL

663
00:40:18,829 --> 00:40:22,200
Mike that's how we got everyone using
security one day and I know we all have

664
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:24,900
some problems with SSL but its also been
Greek

665
00:40:24,900 --> 00:40:28,710
harbor but you can make anything with
Mike this is al traffic you can make it

666
00:40:28,710 --> 00:40:31,310
look kinda boring almost instantaneously

667
00:40:31,310 --> 00:40:34,829
then when he meditated know whether
we're GC you and

668
00:40:34,829 --> 00:40:38,619
and I do is they like that thing that
everybody using crappy tools do what

669
00:40:38,619 --> 00:40:42,869
everyone all over the place they are you
doing other than you getting internet

670
00:40:42,869 --> 00:40:46,760
and none and it's a beautiful gender
doesn't back government I don't think I

671
00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:50,160
think everybody had to use exactly the
main generator tools that were you know

672
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:54,170
produced by exactly the right people
wouldn't have quite so many awesome lobs

673
00:40:54,170 --> 00:40:59,950
noting he said so I'm just curious since
you've obviously spent a lot of time

674
00:40:59,950 --> 00:41:02,010
thinking about this what

675
00:41:02,010 --> 00:41:05,359
your idea is for getting wider spread
and more

676
00:41:05,359 --> 00:41:09,140
implementation adoption have secured
tools

677
00:41:09,140 --> 00:41:12,849
among normal people %uh amuses been a

678
00:41:12,849 --> 00:41:16,359
pet peeve mind for a long time to

679
00:41:16,359 --> 00:41:20,230
and I see it more in this conference
than I can ever

680
00:41:20,230 --> 00:41:23,540
remember seeing it that a lot of people
are saying like

681
00:41:23,540 --> 00:41:26,869
you know emails a problem encrypt email

682
00:41:26,869 --> 00:41:32,230
I started using pgp long time ago using
less today than I did

683
00:41:32,230 --> 00:41:35,410
when I first started because I just
can't get everybody else who is in a

684
00:41:35,410 --> 00:41:35,970
geek

685
00:41:35,970 --> 00:41:39,810
on board with me it's also not really he
can you stop banging your head against a

686
00:41:39,810 --> 00:41:40,290
wall

687
00:41:40,290 --> 00:41:45,150
but in general I mean I see a lot of
people they say on creating system

688
00:41:45,150 --> 00:41:48,410
creating a system for this some cleaning
system for their butt

689
00:41:48,410 --> 00:41:52,420
we need getting adopted you this is
actually one of the reasons why I say we

690
00:41:52,420 --> 00:41:54,980
need to bring the encryption to the
users and we need to bring the better

691
00:41:54,980 --> 00:41:56,380
security practices users

692
00:41:56,380 --> 00:41:59,510
we don't need to make a secure snapshot

693
00:41:59,510 --> 00:42:03,089
we need to start and we made but what we
need to start by saying like how do we

694
00:42:03,089 --> 00:42:04,680
make snapshot secure

695
00:42:04,680 --> 00:42:07,960
like we don't need to make all these
secure things

696
00:42:07,960 --> 00:42:11,859
we need to figure out how to make things
we have more secure and more educated to

697
00:42:11,859 --> 00:42:15,140
the user me is one thing I really liked
about the team's project is that he

698
00:42:15,140 --> 00:42:17,450
brought encryption to Facebook

699
00:42:17,450 --> 00:42:21,859
they'd took care of it but but it was in
the right spirit

700
00:42:21,859 --> 00:42:25,000
I'm and I do think that's when things we
get more adoption with we get more

701
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:26,960
adoption with tools that mimic

702
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:30,950
the tools people want to use and tools
out onto the things people want to use

703
00:42:30,950 --> 00:42:35,359
and we should be taking clues when
people are breaking the same

704
00:42:35,359 --> 00:42:38,790
I'm in San going I have invented a
perfect

705
00:42:38,790 --> 00:42:41,940
I haven't been to the perfect the law
Maltese Falcon

706
00:42:41,940 --> 00:42:45,250
and everyone showcase it now mom

707
00:42:45,250 --> 00:42:49,010
it so I don't think that we get users
now I do wanna say

708
00:42:49,010 --> 00:42:52,700
that on the other end if there's I spent
a long time speaking to people who are

709
00:42:52,700 --> 00:42:55,770
your users that I spent a lot of time
talking about how we can raised

710
00:42:55,770 --> 00:42:59,540
raise digital literacy is how we can
create technical inner cities that are

711
00:42:59,540 --> 00:43:01,510
more useful for this and I think that
that

712
00:43:01,510 --> 00:43:05,900
effort is making progress to I do think
we need more technical leader season

713
00:43:05,900 --> 00:43:08,470
they don't think it'll be solved without
more

714
00:43:08,470 --> 00:43:12,920
but right now there's a lot about for I
in other parts the world going to those

715
00:43:12,920 --> 00:43:15,510
technical leader season they're not
connected to you

716
00:43:15,510 --> 00:43:18,849
the digital literacy for I'm in
education thing

717
00:43:18,849 --> 00:43:22,250
is hot all over the world right now

718
00:43:22,250 --> 00:43:25,410
how many have you knew that

719
00:43:25,410 --> 00:43:29,040
that is a very small number P people in
this room how many have you are

720
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:33,450
in communication with educators over
digital literacy issues

721
00:43:33,450 --> 00:43:39,020
1,2,3,4,5,6,7 noble a second so you
didn't raise your hands last time

722
00:43:39,020 --> 00:43:42,099
the problem min anyway

723
00:43:42,099 --> 00:43:46,890
it isn't much less than 10 percent in
this room and if you are sincerely want

724
00:43:46,890 --> 00:43:49,930
these issues to be solved on the
literacy scale

725
00:43:49,930 --> 00:43:52,270
you should be connected to the
communities they were actually in a

726
00:43:52,270 --> 00:43:53,550
position to do that

727
00:43:53,550 --> 00:43:57,180
and our desperate for people to help
them because they don't have the

728
00:43:57,180 --> 00:43:58,250
knowledge now

729
00:43:58,250 --> 00:44:01,560
we need more cross connections which I
have to say

730
00:44:01,560 --> 00:44:05,359
means that security meet community needs
to learn more manners

731
00:44:05,359 --> 00:44:12,349
if there's no other way past

732
00:44:12,349 --> 00:44:16,319
so one thing he said was that we need
more these tools

733
00:44:16,319 --> 00:44:20,200
we just we need to make a lot of them
even if they stop and then fix them

734
00:44:20,200 --> 00:44:23,880
and that's great and I hear you're
coming from but in my experience working

735
00:44:23,880 --> 00:44:24,770
with users

736
00:44:24,770 --> 00:44:27,829
once there's more than one tool that
accomplishes a specific path but they

737
00:44:27,829 --> 00:44:28,109
get

738
00:44:28,109 --> 00:44:32,130
really confused they're like which one
of the things do I use and

739
00:44:32,130 --> 00:44:35,440
the answer may change over time so what
are your thoughts on

740
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:39,450
keeping people up to date with what tool
they should be using and the expense

741
00:44:39,450 --> 00:44:42,690
up teaching them potentially a new
interface if

742
00:44:42,690 --> 00:44:47,300
a new tool becomes better than the old
one alliance has to do with communities

743
00:44:47,300 --> 00:44:51,700
and tools get adopted by communities not
people especially communication tools

744
00:44:51,700 --> 00:44:55,250
because if you've got that one magic
communications or no one else has

745
00:44:55,250 --> 00:45:01,960
thank you ponder users on I'm you know
congrats the big boobs I

746
00:45:01,960 --> 00:45:05,890
you know you are in a perfect world of
talking to yourself so

747
00:45:05,890 --> 00:45:10,359
unit has that property am language which
is the valuable piece of software

748
00:45:10,359 --> 00:45:13,430
communicative suffer rises with the
number of people using an

749
00:45:13,430 --> 00:45:17,579
not with the interface not with the
security not with how bout Fri it is now

750
00:45:17,579 --> 00:45:19,890
with any of the things that we optimize

751
00:45:19,890 --> 00:45:23,170
but with how many other people on you're
using

752
00:45:23,170 --> 00:45:26,710
how many people in this room have a
Facebook account strictly so they can

753
00:45:26,710 --> 00:45:29,160
talk to their family

754
00:45:29,160 --> 00:45:32,750
more than are currently talking
educators hun

755
00:45:32,750 --> 00:45:36,680
on so you know this is a okay i five
minutes

756
00:45:36,680 --> 00:45:40,140
so so yeah this is this is where we're
at with this is that we need to kinda

757
00:45:40,140 --> 00:45:43,460
liaison with communities and see how
communities in this because ultimately

758
00:45:43,460 --> 00:45:46,760
whatever we think people should use and
how we train them they're actually just

759
00:45:46,760 --> 00:45:48,560
gonna get training from their
communities

760
00:45:48,560 --> 00:45:51,810
so one of the things that we find with
some tools you know when I go through

761
00:45:51,810 --> 00:45:52,460
different

762
00:45:52,460 --> 00:45:55,630
some a community different cultures in
trouble around is

763
00:45:55,630 --> 00:45:59,569
I find the tools will be adopted by
community not because they are better

764
00:45:59,569 --> 00:46:02,260
because they're internationalize better

765
00:46:02,260 --> 00:46:05,960
on and you know at that point I can't
tell them to switch

766
00:46:05,960 --> 00:46:09,510
of have Skype in you something else
because it just isn't nothing else works

767
00:46:09,510 --> 00:46:10,710
for them

768
00:46:10,710 --> 00:46:16,400
for instance thank you

769
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:20,339
you spoke about on social coding
measures as an adjunct to technological

770
00:46:20,339 --> 00:46:22,359
measures personal security

771
00:46:22,359 --> 00:46:25,940
are there any resources that you would
recommend especially for non-technical

772
00:46:25,940 --> 00:46:27,849
people to get started with that

773
00:46:27,849 --> 00:46:32,280
who on that is incredibly can community
specific

774
00:46:32,280 --> 00:46:36,220
cell where I star I'm trying to learn
about that is I look in the community

775
00:46:36,220 --> 00:46:38,839
and look for the people who are
prominent community

776
00:46:38,839 --> 00:46:42,470
and I'm being in it a journalist I'll
often just interviewed them

777
00:46:42,470 --> 00:46:45,780
to try and understand what those things
do I want the reasons why I can point

778
00:46:45,780 --> 00:46:49,599
you to an online resources that many in
these communities are trying to stay

779
00:46:49,599 --> 00:46:52,890
Subrosa cell you know if you are

780
00:46:52,890 --> 00:46:56,680
you know eg gay lebanese kid

781
00:46:56,680 --> 00:47:00,030
there isn't like a weekly for the
language they use to talk about being

782
00:47:00,030 --> 00:47:03,790
gay in lebanon ranges that would kinda
defeat the point

783
00:47:03,790 --> 00:47:08,650
I'm so all I can say is when I do it may
be better resources for this but when I

784
00:47:08,650 --> 00:47:11,000
do it I do it by connecting with people

785
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:15,310
on but I would actually I think probably
the book I would recommend right now and

786
00:47:15,310 --> 00:47:18,339
I am sum up liking your friends but they
helped work on that is am

787
00:47:18,339 --> 00:47:22,430
its Dana Point's book it's complicated
on the

788
00:47:22,430 --> 00:47:26,819
am on the network liza a on the
socialize networks

789
00:47:26,819 --> 00:47:30,540
and kids which goes into a lot of these
things and kind of like

790
00:47:30,540 --> 00:47:34,240
discusses the architecture have these
sorts of measures and it's focused on

791
00:47:34,240 --> 00:47:35,170
america but its

792
00:47:35,170 --> 00:47:38,349
it's a I think a really great start
understanding how commuters networks

793
00:47:38,349 --> 00:47:41,880
interact thank you

794
00:47:41,880 --> 00:47:45,859
I thank you for the wonderful talk so
wanna be your

795
00:47:45,859 --> 00:47:48,980
cue surgeons about could talk to be is
that David

796
00:47:48,980 --> 00:47:52,440
is unbreakable for the amount of time
that it's deployed the Nats

797
00:47:52,440 --> 00:47:56,140
a success what do you know for that
amount of time that it's needed

798
00:47:56,140 --> 00:48:00,220
right what happens when a cryptographic
system

799
00:48:00,220 --> 00:48:03,230
I get adopted and then due to network
Apax becomes

800
00:48:03,230 --> 00:48:06,780
completely entrenched examples include
things like seed

801
00:48:06,780 --> 00:48:09,940
or as a cell to or are

802
00:48:09,940 --> 00:48:14,040
perhaps in certain context things like
rc4 things that are

803
00:48:14,040 --> 00:48:17,200
used to build tools and then

804
00:48:17,200 --> 00:48:22,359
simply bail to go away win there are no
longer needed even after they get broken

805
00:48:22,359 --> 00:48:25,589
what should we do as a security
community about that

806
00:48:25,589 --> 00:48:28,800
I mean you know there's a lot of people
trying to fix this

807
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:32,059
sometimes you just have to kind of come
to a concert build a consensus that

808
00:48:32,059 --> 00:48:35,010
these things get replaced and sometimes
you can fix them

809
00:48:35,010 --> 00:48:38,089
and I think that's true kind of all the
problems with engineering

810
00:48:38,089 --> 00:48:41,559
even on software engineering because a
point where you realize the bridges

811
00:48:41,559 --> 00:48:43,880
really sucks and we have to shut it down
to replace it

812
00:48:43,880 --> 00:48:47,030
but until then we're gonna keep talking
more pieces of metal on it and hope it

813
00:48:47,030 --> 00:48:48,300
doesn't fall down

814
00:48:48,300 --> 00:48:51,309
like this is one of the great problems
in engineering

815
00:48:51,309 --> 00:48:55,240
um so I think when it comes to the
security tools

816
00:48:55,240 --> 00:48:58,109
this brings me where Lee back to the
digital literacy part we need to be

817
00:48:58,109 --> 00:48:59,220
educating communities

818
00:48:59,220 --> 00:49:04,550
educators music concern into supporting
into a consensus to support replacing

819
00:49:04,550 --> 00:49:07,440
really bad pieces and Internet
infrastructure

820
00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:10,520
they need to understand why they need to
do that and that means

821
00:49:10,520 --> 00:49:13,940
we who have that knowledge need to get
better communicating that to them

822
00:49:13,940 --> 00:49:17,460
and bring that message to people on and

823
00:49:17,460 --> 00:49:21,119
and and help them join our consensus to
replace

824
00:49:21,119 --> 00:49:25,550
SSL to and to fix the certs system or
something like that

825
00:49:25,550 --> 00:49:28,829
okay thank you very much are

826
00:49:28,829 --> 00:49:33,280
aka I had a question you talk about how

827
00:49:33,280 --> 00:49:37,770
we have to try and drive adoption the
problem is there's a lot of people who

828
00:49:37,770 --> 00:49:38,400
feel

829
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:43,059
oh well it's not my problem why should I
care sold by actually specifically don't

830
00:49:43,059 --> 00:49:44,319
want to drive adoption

831
00:49:44,319 --> 00:49:47,869
I want to take that software that's been
adopted and work on it

832
00:49:47,869 --> 00:49:52,819
aka its my the far perhaps that is

833
00:49:52,819 --> 00:49:56,420
with having adopted

834
00:49:56,420 --> 00:49:59,510
and trying to improve existing software

835
00:49:59,510 --> 00:50:04,540
how'd you go ahead and say okay you
should use the improved version run

836
00:50:04,540 --> 00:50:07,599
version norm normal comparable I'm

837
00:50:07,599 --> 00:50:11,410
well I do wanna see really quickly and I
think we all need to admit this that

838
00:50:11,410 --> 00:50:11,960
this

839
00:50:11,960 --> 00:50:15,230
a community has had almost

840
00:50:15,230 --> 00:50:19,500
no successes with adoption except maybe
SSL

841
00:50:19,500 --> 00:50:22,950
like 9

842
00:50:22,950 --> 00:50:26,119
out so we need to work with other people
who are better at that

843
00:50:26,119 --> 00:50:29,910
in short which again means a lot more
cross connecting I've got one minute let

844
00:50:29,910 --> 00:50:32,430
me take this one last question real
quick

845
00:50:32,430 --> 00:50:35,880
hi I'm you're talking about schools
and/or

846
00:50:35,880 --> 00:50:40,710
education and security and when it made
me think about how can the school teach

847
00:50:40,710 --> 00:50:42,470
security to children

848
00:50:42,470 --> 00:50:45,880
when it seems like when their main goals
is to not allow children any privacy

849
00:50:45,880 --> 00:50:47,280
whatsoever

850
00:50:47,280 --> 00:50:50,319
that is a great question and I think
that's something that we need to be

851
00:50:50,319 --> 00:50:53,680
doing more to talk about kids security i
really appreciate what

852
00:50:53,680 --> 00:50:57,490
people I can avoid done around this but
I think actually one reasons one ways we

853
00:50:57,490 --> 00:50:58,540
teach them security

854
00:50:58,540 --> 00:51:01,890
and one ways we sneak under the radar
with us is that we teach them what the

855
00:51:01,890 --> 00:51:04,589
network is and how the network sees them

856
00:51:04,589 --> 00:51:08,099
and once people understand what the
network is I didn't teach my daughter

857
00:51:08,099 --> 00:51:11,550
that Google you know was bad in by later
privacy

858
00:51:11,550 --> 00:51:15,510
I said so they do this thing called a
good key

859
00:51:15,510 --> 00:51:18,900
and here's what it does my 11-year-old
daughter after explain how cookies and

860
00:51:18,900 --> 00:51:20,910
javascript work

861
00:51:20,910 --> 00:51:24,099
decided that she was gonna be logged in
to YouTube account

862
00:51:24,099 --> 00:51:27,339
I she's gonna do it on a browser that
she needs for anything else

863
00:51:27,339 --> 00:51:30,720
she came up with that idea after I
explained how it worked or

864
00:51:30,720 --> 00:51:34,559
said kids are incredibly privacy seeking

865
00:51:34,559 --> 00:51:39,589
incredibly they don't lack the desire
for privacy they lack the education and

866
00:51:39,589 --> 00:51:40,920
the means to get

867
00:51:40,920 --> 00:51:44,260
so I think teaching about the network on

868
00:51:44,260 --> 00:51:48,410
not just kids the communities at risk.
news interest we need together and teach

869
00:51:48,410 --> 00:51:53,300
about this thing with bill before it
kills more people

870
00:51:53,300 --> 00:52:00,300
sleep

871
00:52:02,410 --> 00:52:07,370
been

872
00:52:07,370 --> 00:52:09,650
up

873
00:52:09,650 --> 00:52:09,900
thing
