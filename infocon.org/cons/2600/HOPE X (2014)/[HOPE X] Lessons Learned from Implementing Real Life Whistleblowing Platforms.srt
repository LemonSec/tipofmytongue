1
00:00:00,049 --> 00:00:03,060
other things just to get the message out

2
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:06,330
a.m.

3
00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:10,340
so and and the receiver SSF connects to
the torn has to connect to the Tor

4
00:00:10,340 --> 00:00:10,990
network

5
00:00:10,990 --> 00:00:15,059
work he also has he or she has also
receive training to do that

6
00:00:15,059 --> 00:00:19,710
a.m. all the leaks are actually on your
crib to to the media you want to send it

7
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:20,300
to

8
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:23,880
using their PGP keys so it's only stort

9
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:27,930
a temporarily in memory on the public
surfer

10
00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:31,720
then encrypt it to the

11
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:34,850
damn bankrupted to the a users

12
00:00:34,850 --> 00:00:39,710
and then it is actually down compared to
the unencrypted

13
00:00:39,710 --> 00:00:42,730
content is directly a is directly
removed

14
00:00:42,730 --> 00:00:46,930
and the receiver can only receive the
PGP encrypted files

15
00:00:46,930 --> 00:00:50,090
the house actually yes I know that s
thats

16
00:00:50,090 --> 00:00:54,059
before it actually getting ripped
through p2p and where you

17
00:00:54,059 --> 00:00:58,980
try to upload the documents the public
software web publix is based on

18
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:02,480
starts an encrypted ramdisk

19
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:06,060
which is a ass and grip that's I when
the entire

20
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:09,250
leak is completely up know that is what
Dad encrypts

21
00:01:09,250 --> 00:01:13,720
from buy out the PGP key of the
recipient media

22
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:17,280
I am so it does some tarts

23
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:22,080
the disc in plain text at all so

24
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:25,350
and now you're a lil continue in

25
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:28,729
telling something about a small
projector with it

26
00:01:28,729 --> 00:01:32,509
which is wild leeks and so well leaks

27
00:01:32,509 --> 00:01:35,510
I is a platform with Lance a couple of
months ago

28
00:01:35,510 --> 00:01:39,020
so we first talked about Publix was has
like forty

29
00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:43,350
tool for the tree media partners while
Pablo while sheiks

30
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:47,780
is a much smaller instance isn't so much
about the media

31
00:01:47,780 --> 00:01:52,890
both about exposing while higher
wrongdoing my text robbery

32
00:01:52,890 --> 00:01:56,509
I am illegal arching Andy Diggle facing

33
00:01:56,509 --> 00:02:00,970
on around the world and this group works
with partners on the ground to stop the

34
00:02:00,970 --> 00:02:02,040
people farm

35
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:05,250
a.m. be the killing or I'm

36
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:08,390
trying to stop illegal smuggling of

37
00:02:08,390 --> 00:02:12,700
ivory for example I'm so this arm thing
is also

38
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:18,049
also this process or service and lower
leagues it someone rebar me it's done by

39
00:02:18,049 --> 00:02:21,500
people from the other friendly I am
addicts

40
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:24,940
more or less exposes wrongdoing so I
think

41
00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:29,630
wanting those pretty interesting is that
arm so one of the people behind this

42
00:02:29,630 --> 00:02:34,250
yes I'll Andrea costs crossed our

43
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:39,770
shoots moves -ism cool

44
00:02:39,770 --> 00:02:44,560
actually expose want to ask about groups
and

45
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:48,239
in somalia generates funds by smuggling
ivory

46
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:52,440
I'm so this is actually interesting
because he would think that this is an

47
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:55,580
I'm kinda acted as project and then they
expose that

48
00:02:55,580 --> 00:02:58,590
terrorists are using a ivory

49
00:02:58,590 --> 00:03:02,140
to generate funds for the terrorist
activities

50
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:06,440
I'm so that's interesting and I am arm

51
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:10,310
in three months time there were about
twenty four tips ranging from

52
00:03:10,310 --> 00:03:13,390
importing illegal wildlife products into
the US

53
00:03:13,390 --> 00:03:16,860
to illegal not seeing a massive cum
milem

54
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:19,989
mine of our and siberia so

55
00:03:19,989 --> 00:03:25,200
when they get this tip it isn't so much
about sperm

56
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:29,060
trying to get this into the media than
it is about it's a small bouts

57
00:03:29,060 --> 00:03:33,250
trying to stopped a big group from
smuggling

58
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:36,849
and exposes doing this kind of
wrongdoing

59
00:03:36,849 --> 00:03:40,379
home I think you

60
00:03:40,379 --> 00:03:45,250
are the next slide so

61
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:49,569
a when looking acts implementing
whistleblower platforms

62
00:03:49,569 --> 00:03:53,420
you search just sold two very different
cases both

63
00:03:53,420 --> 00:03:58,019
in who are who dis suppliers are ok
information who the receivers are and

64
00:03:58,019 --> 00:03:59,400
what the aim of the platform is

65
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:04,250
and and we think it's very important
with every platform you want to set up

66
00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:08,250
a to make proper risk assessment the

67
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:11,459
am and a to

68
00:04:11,459 --> 00:04:15,230
look at all the risks and also inform
whistleblowers about risks

69
00:04:15,230 --> 00:04:18,380
so if you look at the with her blow
whistle blower

70
00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:23,110
tourists are not only to a risk of
technological exposure

71
00:04:23,110 --> 00:04:26,890
but it is also about social exposure
because you're not leaking this

72
00:04:26,890 --> 00:04:30,370
in a vacuum and there's a there's a very
big chance that's

73
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:34,810
a I mean your leaking some rum something
from your business

74
00:04:34,810 --> 00:04:38,400
how many pop people had access to this
information

75
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:41,790
the are you %uh

76
00:04:41,790 --> 00:04:45,110
do you have a crush with your boss
already my disrespect you

77
00:04:45,110 --> 00:04:48,590
shoulder there's all this thing suggest
to take an account

78
00:04:48,590 --> 00:04:52,760
if you are if you are a whistleblower
dat

79
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:56,000
das not only had have to do with
technology

80
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,830
'em so and to the receivers the sisters
same thing

81
00:05:00,830 --> 00:05:04,800
expect especially a if looking at the

82
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:09,190
the wildlife platform you you're working
with people who are investigating thing

83
00:05:09,190 --> 00:05:10,669
simply to terrorism

84
00:05:10,669 --> 00:05:13,919
if you look at journalists as we see in
this

85
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:18,310
free society a journalist some are more
and more targeted at

86
00:05:18,310 --> 00:05:21,510
a if it comes to exposing

87
00:05:21,510 --> 00:05:25,670
a.m. if it comes to exposing people
through whistleblowers

88
00:05:25,670 --> 00:05:29,910
a and then of course there's also the
risks to the platform sole

89
00:05:29,910 --> 00:05:33,140
what are the risks I mean %uh

90
00:05:33,140 --> 00:05:36,560
looking at its the two cases that we
just discussed

91
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:40,900
the risks for wilde's leaks are
completely different

92
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:44,370
in terms of the risk to the platform
asterisks

93
00:05:44,370 --> 00:05:48,790
are for the public's case for instance

94
00:05:48,790 --> 00:05:52,320
a in the wild leeks case the chances are
locks a

95
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:56,330
smaller that the Dutch police will kick
in our front door

96
00:05:56,330 --> 00:05:59,980
and and Ascot ask our ask some questions
to us

97
00:05:59,980 --> 00:06:04,940
whereas in the public's case that does
chances are still hopefully not too big

98
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:05,340
but

99
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:08,780
are at least larger and we have to take
that does more into account

100
00:06:08,780 --> 00:06:11,950
a.m. so

101
00:06:11,950 --> 00:06:15,560
the the other thing I job down here was
the ease of use for

102
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:18,870
first theoretical security but I think I
already mentioned that

103
00:06:18,870 --> 00:06:22,800
in talking about %uh how people could
submit

104
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:26,740
I think there's a little there's always
a risk of over engineering security

105
00:06:26,740 --> 00:06:30,940
a where people would just a places the

106
00:06:30,940 --> 00:06:36,030
a.m. a place a rock between the door

107
00:06:36,030 --> 00:06:39,160
if they need to get through twenty times
today and

108
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:43,300
there's this this impossible look that
they have to open

109
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:48,010
every time so there is always a
trade-off between

110
00:06:48,010 --> 00:06:53,190
the theoretical security and practical
security that has to do with the effort

111
00:06:53,190 --> 00:06:54,530
people have to put into it

112
00:06:54,530 --> 00:07:00,240
and that relates to the risk that they
actually think they are

113
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:03,550
in which has nothing to do with their
usually not

114
00:07:03,550 --> 00:07:06,720
has nothing to do but a risk there are
actually in

115
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:12,930
so to take away so far after

116
00:07:12,930 --> 00:07:16,460
implementing these platforms and some
others is

117
00:07:16,460 --> 00:07:20,590
a things to look at is how key separate
responsibilities make sure

118
00:07:20,590 --> 00:07:24,770
that there's no not a single person who
has access to everything

119
00:07:24,770 --> 00:07:28,500
I am and who is also clearly known by
the outside world

120
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:32,740
the mmm so in Publix case we did that by

121
00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:35,990
having all this kinda a separate each
organizations

122
00:07:35,990 --> 00:07:39,940
and still have a very strong relations a
relation with the press

123
00:07:39,940 --> 00:07:44,350
because in in most of the other Western
countries Press

124
00:07:44,350 --> 00:07:47,530
a get some extra protection in law

125
00:07:47,530 --> 00:07:51,960
a am joost jurisdiction addiction to
your advantage

126
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:55,220
so if you are building the leaking
platform for from for

127
00:07:55,220 --> 00:07:59,250
form for ukraine maybe you shouldn't
hosted you

128
00:07:59,250 --> 00:08:03,720
in Ukraine but somewhere else a if
you're building one

129
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:07,150
a for the US maybe you should not hosted
in the US

130
00:08:07,150 --> 00:08:10,720
a am do not work in a vague

131
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:13,880
perfect %um create a platform to work
with a

132
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:17,370
your users work with the whole use case
that thing you want to do you think

133
00:08:17,370 --> 00:08:18,220
it'll true

134
00:08:18,220 --> 00:08:22,380
the don't start out with the idea that
is two technologies

135
00:08:22,380 --> 00:08:25,560
that's gonna solve it it's my G is only
part of the

136
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:29,060
the solution the user's

137
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:33,040
and receivers and everybody is is part
of a secure

138
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:37,230
of the solution of making online
whistleblowing more secure

139
00:08:37,230 --> 00:08:42,770
a by that is also make clear what your
use case RM for what your platform

140
00:08:42,770 --> 00:08:45,790
can be used what not I am

141
00:08:45,790 --> 00:08:50,100
leaking about a three-letter government
agency

142
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:53,390
is a different kind piece of cased cake
been leaking

143
00:08:53,390 --> 00:08:56,430
about something %uh

144
00:08:56,430 --> 00:09:00,750
dad has less of an omnipotent power a

145
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:04,680
and Cody sign with your users make sure
that day are involved in the process

146
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:07,120
especially do really users that you can
actually

147
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:10,810
reach out to I mean it's hard to reach
out to do whistleblowers before they

148
00:09:10,810 --> 00:09:12,260
know that their whistleblowers

149
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:16,870
but you can reach out to people
receiving the information

150
00:09:16,870 --> 00:09:20,160
and and other people around you can com

151
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:24,519
you can work with a user testing

152
00:09:24,519 --> 00:09:29,329
them and and try to make something that
actually works for

153
00:09:29,329 --> 00:09:33,159
Ford a platform that you're trying to
create

154
00:09:33,159 --> 00:09:36,249
a.m. next up is

155
00:09:36,249 --> 00:09:40,139
euro hotel a bit more about the global
each platform itself

156
00:09:40,139 --> 00:09:46,459
and so there was just a wonderful
presentation about the secure a drop

157
00:09:46,459 --> 00:09:47,299
software

158
00:09:47,299 --> 00:09:50,399
and for me that that prop software I am

159
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:53,599
and before though a secure up there was
something called Global leaks

160
00:09:53,599 --> 00:09:58,779
I was West's released asked the first
time and I'm September 2011

161
00:09:58,779 --> 00:10:03,659
man from them on in moment on their work
on and off-farm

162
00:10:03,659 --> 00:10:07,509
about it and now they have about its and
a around

163
00:10:07,509 --> 00:10:11,369
to the parcel web sites using the
probably somewhere

164
00:10:11,369 --> 00:10:14,889
a mostly in Europe actually
anti-semitism

165
00:10:14,889 --> 00:10:18,439
the US ranging from poppy

166
00:10:18,439 --> 00:10:21,849
X well at least a mafia meeks I'll

167
00:10:21,849 --> 00:10:26,519
where mafia big sis from account website
for you crudes

168
00:10:26,519 --> 00:10:30,599
upload information about Eastern
European mafia but they're mostly get

169
00:10:30,599 --> 00:10:33,829
information about mafia from all kinds
of ways places

170
00:10:33,829 --> 00:10:39,139
have I am so it's really hard for them
to work with its from other understands

171
00:10:39,139 --> 00:10:42,799
arm so they've been around for a long
time arm

172
00:10:42,799 --> 00:10:47,099
very happy in undergoing I'm followed
its there has been an auditor

173
00:10:47,099 --> 00:10:50,819
published a couple of months ago by the
lease authority people

174
00:10:50,819 --> 00:10:55,079
are more flexible likes who works there
were some tight hole ass

175
00:10:55,079 --> 00:10:59,619
I'm actually it is a simple as running
instances I think its eighteen

176
00:10:59,619 --> 00:11:02,899
not really I'm sorry which is run by so
the

177
00:11:02,899 --> 00:11:07,049
the cali somewheres mostly written by
about some Italians

178
00:11:07,049 --> 00:11:10,919
the wall are while working for the hamas
foundation of

179
00:11:10,919 --> 00:11:14,029
from dish it all human rights and
security

180
00:11:14,029 --> 00:11:17,359
numb base in Italy and a few half

181
00:11:17,359 --> 00:11:20,939
a bunch of software that been working on
so for example MOBOTIX

182
00:11:20,939 --> 00:11:24,319
I also thought well what's was a former
I'm

183
00:11:24,319 --> 00:11:28,049
project from errands what's have to come
over there's a bunch of

184
00:11:28,049 --> 00:11:32,069
arm process that's frenzel time heavy
workout like for example

185
00:11:32,069 --> 00:11:36,239
and voice clients to upload the
information they work together with the

186
00:11:36,239 --> 00:11:37,409
Guardian products

187
00:11:37,409 --> 00:11:41,659
around for example like that have been
plans to

188
00:11:41,659 --> 00:11:44,739
integrate the copley sup world's and
then I'm

189
00:11:44,739 --> 00:11:47,819
abs like in for my cam I am and I'm

190
00:11:47,819 --> 00:11:51,209
that kinda stuff so that some pretty big
ecosystem around the earth

191
00:11:51,209 --> 00:11:55,689
and what is interesting about it is to
compare it to something my secure drop

192
00:11:55,689 --> 00:11:59,179
secure dropped really has one use case
and others to arm

193
00:11:59,179 --> 00:12:02,879
really have a secure environment for one
journalistic entity

194
00:12:02,879 --> 00:12:06,409
well as Wallace could be used for all
kinds of use cases for example you know

195
00:12:06,409 --> 00:12:06,989
welfare

196
00:12:06,989 --> 00:12:11,269
excellence is the one entity one a kind
of active physical on his Asian

197
00:12:11,269 --> 00:12:15,009
is more flexible you good to know why
the security or you could improve the

198
00:12:15,009 --> 00:12:15,689
security

199
00:12:15,689 --> 00:12:20,279
I'm mobile excess more lines of code for
example

200
00:12:20,279 --> 00:12:23,889
arm but it could also be used for all
kinds of other

201
00:12:23,889 --> 00:12:26,909
purposes as I was alone arm

202
00:12:26,909 --> 00:12:30,409
piece of software and/or incision with
a.m. an existing

203
00:12:30,409 --> 00:12:33,459
organization like companies like shell
or BP

204
00:12:33,459 --> 00:12:36,649
wax on I am so

205
00:12:36,649 --> 00:12:40,129
best dressup other ways to use Adobe
software

206
00:12:40,129 --> 00:12:45,779
i think thats believe interesting
because maybe we don't always want to

207
00:12:45,779 --> 00:12:49,619
expose everything to the public because
what we've been seeing

208
00:12:49,619 --> 00:12:53,169
as well by Publix for sample or meet up
with the journalists a

209
00:12:53,169 --> 00:12:57,139
they say they're sometimes because those
are kind of chat function

210
00:12:57,139 --> 00:13:00,899
within a global excel file when I'll was
a blow up Los material

211
00:13:00,899 --> 00:13:04,389
you could have a one-on-one chats with
the whistle-blower I'm also the time the

212
00:13:04,389 --> 00:13:05,149
whistleblower

213
00:13:05,149 --> 00:13:09,009
years arm upsets because he didn't get a
promotion

214
00:13:09,009 --> 00:13:14,220
I'm his France within the company has
coworker got a promotion size matters

215
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:14,699
gonna

216
00:13:14,699 --> 00:13:18,689
leak information about whatever arm

217
00:13:18,689 --> 00:13:21,809
and most the time comes out them

218
00:13:21,809 --> 00:13:26,279
oftentimes it also doesn't come out so
that's a little 'em that's a big influx

219
00:13:26,279 --> 00:13:29,449
arm worst kind of to think that it's
more

220
00:13:29,449 --> 00:13:33,749
flexible in years and this is why I'm at
a point in time where we started looking

221
00:13:33,749 --> 00:13:34,499
around

222
00:13:34,499 --> 00:13:37,759
we mostly first look dats I'm

223
00:13:37,759 --> 00:13:41,809
I was officials was a long summer made
in Germany by a newspaper called those

224
00:13:41,809 --> 00:13:42,389
sites

225
00:13:42,389 --> 00:13:46,100
if I'm right and they have been working
on some kind of

226
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:50,509
from I'm remain a panel system so that
you if you could email

227
00:13:50,509 --> 00:13:53,539
leak it will too get four emails a few
times

228
00:13:53,539 --> 00:13:58,829
bush or treaters the journalist while we
talk about was in pretty soon here

229
00:13:58,829 --> 00:14:02,519
because people don't really use remain
us about so that might be pretty of use

230
00:14:02,519 --> 00:14:03,149
these days

231
00:14:03,149 --> 00:14:06,249
well the the problem was mostly that
stir

232
00:14:06,249 --> 00:14:12,329
the system last designs I think also
with some legal advice

233
00:14:12,329 --> 00:14:17,149
in mind but was mostly the name to
softwares police costume by the way

234
00:14:17,149 --> 00:14:18,419
which means mailbox

235
00:14:18,419 --> 00:14:22,739
the and but it was mostly the signed to

236
00:14:22,739 --> 00:14:26,329
and works very well for protecting the
journalists

237
00:14:26,329 --> 00:14:29,939
but less so for actually protecting the
whistleblower which was

238
00:14:29,939 --> 00:14:33,119
for us pretty important as you can
imagine

239
00:14:33,119 --> 00:14:36,619
right sell for example at the Publix web
sites

240
00:14:36,619 --> 00:14:40,109
way you go to the actual leaking

241
00:14:40,109 --> 00:14:43,409
sides it also you it also

242
00:14:43,409 --> 00:14:46,949
account notification that if you go
there without them

243
00:14:46,949 --> 00:14:50,809
using something like till so that all
girls in my life was a whining

244
00:14:50,809 --> 00:14:54,409
and we see that you're not using toy I
maybe you should use tor

245
00:14:54,409 --> 00:14:57,799
and here's a link to the tall grass a
bomb though I'm here

246
00:14:57,799 --> 00:15:01,009
here's a link to security in the box was
is arm

247
00:15:01,009 --> 00:15:04,489
I kind of right up by the tactic attack
farm

248
00:15:04,489 --> 00:15:07,769
collective a base in Berlin I'm

249
00:15:07,769 --> 00:15:11,199
which shows you how to use digital
security hands

250
00:15:11,199 --> 00:15:15,119
we are some tips about operational
security practice us for example

251
00:15:15,119 --> 00:15:18,519
I'm so we have linked to that and if you
go there arm

252
00:15:18,519 --> 00:15:22,419
and there you go on and say okay I kind
of understand the risks and then you got

253
00:15:22,419 --> 00:15:24,409
a question that way the to say that

254
00:15:24,409 --> 00:15:27,459
okay I understand that this is a précis
knots

255
00:15:27,459 --> 00:15:30,909
secure but I choose in any way to upload
when documents through its

256
00:15:30,909 --> 00:15:34,179
I'm and if you go there wit or I'm

257
00:15:34,179 --> 00:15:38,029
its between the tactical you will get
redirected to the onion

258
00:15:38,029 --> 00:15:41,949
so I'm it's a simple ass

259
00:15:41,949 --> 00:15:45,399
basically up getting some globally us
I'm issue for us

260
00:15:45,399 --> 00:15:50,249
at the apt repository and there the BBQ
to verify the other

261
00:15:50,249 --> 00:15:55,819
out and the City I miss miss the base
umpire Tony an angle I J ass

262
00:15:55,819 --> 00:16:01,269
it has a new aid CPR license is mostly
uses PDP in the ass encryption

263
00:16:01,269 --> 00:16:04,309
a as a group of around this anatase

264
00:16:04,309 --> 00:16:07,649
at the well-documented API so you could

265
00:16:07,649 --> 00:16:14,389
rights all kinds of Cooper caissons like

266
00:16:14,389 --> 00:16:18,529
for example the apparatus too scholarly
sand right application both because also

267
00:16:18,529 --> 00:16:19,409
be used to

268
00:16:19,409 --> 00:16:23,769
integrated into other I'm because I said
before like in former camp from the

269
00:16:23,769 --> 00:16:25,189
Guardian project

270
00:16:25,189 --> 00:16:30,739
I am so as a South it has been around
for a while so there has also been all

271
00:16:30,739 --> 00:16:31,409
that it's

272
00:16:31,409 --> 00:16:35,449
by a couple of organizations throughout
the years I'll one of them is

273
00:16:35,449 --> 00:16:39,949
i sec mark has was also all the tats I'm
the call to secure drop

274
00:16:39,949 --> 00:16:44,119
arm grew 53 was is really small
consulting

275
00:16:44,119 --> 00:16:47,339
I warm company basin

276
00:16:47,339 --> 00:16:50,409
basing your food there are some really
good stuff around

277
00:16:50,409 --> 00:16:55,779
I'm other team a lot of processed our
friend weapon a are pretty fantastic in

278
00:16:55,779 --> 00:16:57,439
what I do

279
00:16:57,439 --> 00:17:03,079
and very clear also that one at the end
of 2013 and these are the people

280
00:17:03,079 --> 00:17:06,279
arm uncovered a few vulnerabilities
which has been

281
00:17:06,279 --> 00:17:10,849
pat's almost the past I am as of now

282
00:17:10,849 --> 00:17:14,579
suffer from undergoing some of its

283
00:17:14,579 --> 00:17:18,299
I'm and I we have to go to web so
actually

284
00:17:18,299 --> 00:17:21,699
it's more I'll like web to toil

285
00:17:21,699 --> 00:17:27,659
how that means that if you go to with a
browser to secure the public's other now

286
00:17:27,659 --> 00:17:32,330
you get free direct outs internally at
the server side to the actual

287
00:17:32,330 --> 00:17:37,309
haven't or even surface so you don't
actually have to insult or to resolve

288
00:17:37,309 --> 00:17:38,119
the toy

289
00:17:38,119 --> 00:17:41,509
intervals internally so that's what the
server side is doing for you

290
00:17:41,509 --> 00:17:45,070
of course is always better to use that
all Russell 1000 but we also

291
00:17:45,070 --> 00:17:49,450
I made this decision to I'm

292
00:17:49,450 --> 00:17:52,970
try to make its the barrier little bit
lower

293
00:17:52,970 --> 00:17:56,639
for people to upload information because
it's not always the nation state that

294
00:17:56,639 --> 00:17:58,359
this you and me.

295
00:17:58,359 --> 00:18:02,690
not always am South mostly based on pipe
and I'm

296
00:18:02,690 --> 00:18:05,769
you know you pass from the right to the
door you know servicers

297
00:18:05,769 --> 00:18:09,740
I miss you does your store you get to be
director its

298
00:18:09,740 --> 00:18:13,070
and it was still so secure the public
somehow she actually use the tall grass

299
00:18:13,070 --> 00:18:13,919
a bundle

300
00:18:13,919 --> 00:18:18,029
you've got the right redirected to the
actual human service at the Russell

301
00:18:18,029 --> 00:18:22,330
you will see that issue you said he will
go from secure the Pakistan out to

302
00:18:22,330 --> 00:18:25,789
something something that I am resistant
to the

303
00:18:25,789 --> 00:18:29,279
this the sort of steel the farm the door
hit

304
00:18:29,279 --> 00:18:34,839
in service I am so within them the
double text thing we

305
00:18:34,839 --> 00:18:39,460
I A apace and also I am at the wealthy
accepting getting closer to

306
00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:44,919
a p2p 4,096 bit key I'm it can only be
read on the laptop running

307
00:18:44,919 --> 00:18:48,299
tales Orem este arm I'm

308
00:18:48,299 --> 00:18:51,440
as the journal is a good enough they
could probably also for the system

309
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:55,639
using the toll grows among law I'm this
on record a computer but we made it

310
00:18:55,639 --> 00:18:57,059
really clear about that

311
00:18:57,059 --> 00:19:01,159
they should always use tales and keep it
up today to reassure them how to do it

312
00:19:01,159 --> 00:19:05,669
I'm and there's a kind of I'll so we
have a brother the information

313
00:19:05,669 --> 00:19:08,820
there's a way to so we choose

314
00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:12,750
at the moment that there was a local
October 27 different media

315
00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:15,849
entities because muscle actual me

316
00:19:15,849 --> 00:19:19,109
most of the media organizations own half

317
00:19:19,109 --> 00:19:22,940
I'm investigative team at anymore

318
00:19:22,940 --> 00:19:27,220
so it's mostly freelance Journal as one
well as working on its

319
00:19:27,220 --> 00:19:32,039
arm so as a way to have a one-on-one
conversation with the person

320
00:19:32,039 --> 00:19:36,010
Paso the and was a row aisle with the
recipient

321
00:19:36,010 --> 00:19:39,139
or I'm the receiver us and

322
00:19:39,139 --> 00:19:43,190
the whistleblower so term receivers
coach culture act

323
00:19:43,190 --> 00:19:46,389
I'm and see the other I'm chats phone

324
00:19:46,389 --> 00:19:49,679
the other receivers I'm

325
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:53,299
and a half a kind of small comparison
with secure drop although it's

326
00:19:53,299 --> 00:19:56,769
it so it's kind of hard to do because
I'm sorry

327
00:19:56,769 --> 00:20:00,609
a kind of data comparisons using
discerned

328
00:20:00,609 --> 00:20:04,220
his case from secure drop with Publix
I'm

329
00:20:04,220 --> 00:20:07,859
I was just a one on one with one come

330
00:20:07,859 --> 00:20:11,829
with one entity I'm

331
00:20:11,829 --> 00:20:16,809
I mean them I guess the global issues
experience for both parties that being

332
00:20:16,809 --> 00:20:19,529
the receiver and there was a row is
kinda busy a

333
00:20:19,529 --> 00:20:23,700
I'm of course the secure dropped ng Haus
things like a matter of time

334
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:29,250
and I'm Anacapa hands arm some kind of
idea system monitoring the serval what's

335
00:20:29,250 --> 00:20:31,599
coming and I like forty traffic

336
00:20:31,599 --> 00:20:37,029
so that's execute drop as in hi I'm I'm
security truck was always a good thing

337
00:20:37,029 --> 00:20:41,230
home girl the same thing could be
applied to global TX although it has a

338
00:20:41,230 --> 00:20:43,609
small eyes have called so potentially a
bigot

339
00:20:43,609 --> 00:20:47,010
I'm arms attack factor being there

340
00:20:47,010 --> 00:20:50,899
and will secure a drop pass last lines
of calls I think this lesson

341
00:20:50,899 --> 00:20:54,720
a couple of thousands of lines are some
three thousand lines I guess

342
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:59,779
I am and then I guess the global ace has
some kinda by the security for

343
00:20:59,779 --> 00:21:00,809
submitting data

344
00:21:00,809 --> 00:21:04,799
being bankrupt us ramdisk I'm before
they actually

345
00:21:04,799 --> 00:21:08,369
get sank refer to PDP and then being put
on the disc

346
00:21:08,369 --> 00:21:11,649
I am and I am I mean

347
00:21:11,649 --> 00:21:15,379
the kind of win I yes I guess there's
not really a winner because it has many

348
00:21:15,379 --> 00:21:16,460
different use cases

349
00:21:16,460 --> 00:21:21,260
you should use the use case with this
what you want for the specific platform

350
00:21:21,260 --> 00:21:22,599
as you have in mind

351
00:21:22,599 --> 00:21:26,010
if you want something just for one from

352
00:21:26,010 --> 00:21:29,980
organization with higher security
because view of the washington post

353
00:21:29,980 --> 00:21:32,619
thank you expect high profile leaks

354
00:21:32,619 --> 00:21:36,329
that I would totally recommend you to go
to secure drop if you want something

355
00:21:36,329 --> 00:21:37,510
within the company

356
00:21:37,510 --> 00:21:43,510
or I'm using multiple rhythm recipients
you should totally use globally X

357
00:21:43,510 --> 00:21:48,019
I'm so there's not really a winner I'm
and I guess with thats

358
00:21:48,019 --> 00:21:51,690
I'm gonna handed over to Sasha was gonna
stick something about the takeaways

359
00:21:51,690 --> 00:21:54,919
that yeah just to come back to the who
the winner is

360
00:21:54,919 --> 00:21:58,789
I think we are the winner here and that
there are now two excellent

361
00:21:58,789 --> 00:22:03,559
platforms emerging for whistleblowing
something that we've been

362
00:22:03,559 --> 00:22:06,659
all waiting for I think after like

363
00:22:06,659 --> 00:22:10,329
a whole week leaks saga

364
00:22:10,329 --> 00:22:15,619
started with him waiting for a way to
more distribute this because you don't

365
00:22:15,619 --> 00:22:17,960
want a single platform taking all the

366
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:21,070
all the blows because we're still
looking at

367
00:22:21,070 --> 00:22:25,670
aftermath that soul die for city is
great here and there

368
00:22:25,670 --> 00:22:29,050
I'm I'm really happy that's although it
it took some time

369
00:22:29,050 --> 00:22:33,090
there are now two projects that's dad

370
00:22:33,090 --> 00:22:37,870
are being developed thats provide this
kind of things and and make it possible

371
00:22:37,870 --> 00:22:39,330
for people to start their own

372
00:22:39,330 --> 00:22:43,650
left a.m. so yes to the takeaways we can

373
00:22:43,650 --> 00:22:48,690
after yours introduction to the to the
platforms I think we can add two things

374
00:22:48,690 --> 00:22:51,760
I am and that is a.m.

375
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:55,860
you should choose a technology that my
best matches your problem told look into

376
00:22:55,860 --> 00:22:58,050
the software's look at the web sites and

377
00:22:58,050 --> 00:23:01,059
look at the communities and and and
choose technology

378
00:23:01,059 --> 00:23:04,860
thats fits that the thing you want to do
the most

379
00:23:04,860 --> 00:23:07,880
and also work with the developers both

380
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:12,190
a global leaks and secure drop have a
great team of developers

381
00:23:12,190 --> 00:23:16,040
who are you through very willing to help

382
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:20,630
out and think with you about what the
best solution would be and what security

383
00:23:20,630 --> 00:23:21,620
risks you

384
00:23:21,620 --> 00:23:25,470
could have and they also have all more
experience with building more of his

385
00:23:25,470 --> 00:23:27,420
whistleblowing platforms and just one

386
00:23:27,420 --> 00:23:31,690
soul a.m. I think a.m.

387
00:23:31,690 --> 00:23:35,320
adept would be a great tips so

388
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:38,780
dan a.m. to a more or less

389
00:23:38,780 --> 00:23:42,130
wrap it up before we're taking questions
a

390
00:23:42,130 --> 00:23:49,130
yuri is gonna tell you how you can help
so you don't always have to run it was

391
00:23:49,809 --> 00:23:51,110
so got a platform to help

392
00:23:51,110 --> 00:23:54,780
rights so their supply lines of ways and
as a bouncer problems that we need to

393
00:23:54,780 --> 00:23:55,350
solve

394
00:23:55,350 --> 00:23:58,770
adding one of these problems without the
need to advocate was so close

395
00:23:58,770 --> 00:24:02,800
not potential whistleblowers but this
icon enter into

396
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:07,040
sacked with to think people about what a
computer is so what's

397
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:10,870
on the internet actually is a lot how
you can protect yourself

398
00:24:10,870 --> 00:24:13,960
so we when we talk about you know
cybersecurity

399
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:18,790
we talk about of an surf I'm security
against nation-states

400
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:24,290
and its people are pretty volatile right
i mean we all know this so we need to

401
00:24:24,290 --> 00:24:25,380
protect people

402
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:29,320
in a way that we can say that issue for
use free and open source software

403
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:32,520
issues I'm I'm

404
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:36,840
educate people on about you know how
they can be secure online

405
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:41,270
and all that kind of stuff and we need
loss to make this happen so for doubts

406
00:24:41,270 --> 00:24:45,130
you know the people from the FFT 8 the
the ACR I'll you

407
00:24:45,130 --> 00:24:49,420
and Adrian Europe I don't fantastic work
and then eat your money to make this

408
00:24:49,420 --> 00:24:52,380
kind of things happen and they are proof
investing in what I do

409
00:24:52,380 --> 00:24:55,760
I'm issue a really good colour or you
can

410
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:59,410
from for you real of documenting I'm
documenting stuff

411
00:24:59,410 --> 00:25:05,070
or I'm just coding in general you could
to consumers who for you XD UX designer

412
00:25:05,070 --> 00:25:08,340
yes for example you could you know

413
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:12,670
contribute to project likes I'm globally
X occurs robbed or

414
00:25:12,670 --> 00:25:15,720
tales and LTR I am the

415
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:19,230
de cerveza people you know trunk ripped
apart is

416
00:25:19,230 --> 00:25:22,450
I'm which is a pretty good thing to do
so thank you for that

417
00:25:22,450 --> 00:25:25,700
I am this also have other people you
know will train

418
00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:29,610
journalists I'm thing the press freedom
foundation

419
00:25:29,610 --> 00:25:33,150
is one of these are organizations was
doing that I am

420
00:25:33,150 --> 00:25:37,370
if you're really good in this kind of
thing so I think you should do that I am

421
00:25:37,370 --> 00:25:40,400
am I mean we need to improve loss

422
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:44,580
pretty badly am that being made all
around the world to make whistleblowing

423
00:25:44,580 --> 00:25:45,590
protection brother

424
00:25:45,590 --> 00:25:50,220
I'm and I guess I didn't put it on it
but I remember now

425
00:25:50,220 --> 00:25:53,570
without people on the course foundation
based in berlin

426
00:25:53,570 --> 00:25:57,419
I'm on them from Sarah Harrison will
helps at what's know them

427
00:25:57,419 --> 00:26:02,410
escape to moscow you know this is one of
the organization's was make sure that

428
00:26:02,410 --> 00:26:05,580
it people are have information and a
life

429
00:26:05,580 --> 00:26:09,650
really is at risk and a want to
sacrifice themselves like adults now the

430
00:26:09,650 --> 00:26:11,260
less fossil Chelsea Manning

431
00:26:11,260 --> 00:26:14,500
I'm dumb maybe we should help them and

432
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:18,390
maybe we should donate to the cause
because they have done something for

433
00:26:18,390 --> 00:26:19,190
pasick

434
00:26:19,190 --> 00:26:23,370
for the most of us I'm so maybe we
should encourage that I'm

435
00:26:23,370 --> 00:26:27,980
so this how you can help and

436
00:26:27,980 --> 00:26:32,669
yeah looks like okay so now the floor is
open to questions

437
00:26:32,669 --> 00:26:36,860
if you want to reach us there is to it
securely

438
00:26:36,860 --> 00:26:41,740
I'm so if you have any questions there
are Mikes

439
00:26:41,740 --> 00:26:45,800
I think we'll hear one in the middle
from

440
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:49,990
so if you have any questions or whatever

441
00:26:49,990 --> 00:26:53,260
police lineup couple of comments and
then

442
00:26:53,260 --> 00:26:56,370
couple questions 10 you know thank you
for

443
00:26:56,370 --> 00:26:59,830
for all your work I think we all heard
yesterday that

444
00:26:59,830 --> 00:27:05,700
and using technology to solve these
kinds of issues increase transparency is

445
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:07,160
probably one of the greatest ways

446
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:10,250
this community can get back to a better
world

447
00:27:10,250 --> 00:27:14,700
and second one as I think it's great
that everybody's

448
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:19,380
using the same kind of toward type
infrastructure in interface simply

449
00:27:19,380 --> 00:27:22,800
because it makes traffic analysis to any
of these sites

450
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:26,010
I'm more difficult for for the

451
00:27:26,010 --> 00:27:29,610
the bad guys I'm

452
00:27:29,610 --> 00:27:33,159
a question and wall one other comment

453
00:27:33,159 --> 00:27:37,190
personally I I get upset about hearing
secure drop versus so-and-so and who's

454
00:27:37,190 --> 00:27:38,120
the winner

455
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:42,290
you know these are all efforts to order
heard a great contribution to the world

456
00:27:42,290 --> 00:27:42,679
in

457
00:27:42,679 --> 00:27:46,310
don't feel like winners and losers a
decent different drug cases

458
00:27:46,310 --> 00:27:50,350
use cases and so forth when them

459
00:27:50,350 --> 00:27:54,360
there was an interesting thing that was
mentioned in the secure drop

460
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:57,770
presentation the other day and again I'm
not trying to go compared to spark

461
00:27:57,770 --> 00:27:58,900
something my bring

462
00:27:58,900 --> 00:28:02,470
they talked about a server being located
in the press room

463
00:28:02,470 --> 00:28:07,169
simply because the US courts had decided
that that was protected just like the

464
00:28:07,169 --> 00:28:08,470
journalist

465
00:28:08,470 --> 00:28:11,590
and the only issue that brought it to me
was while

466
00:28:11,590 --> 00:28:15,630
the technology solution has to address
different laws

467
00:28:15,630 --> 00:28:18,750
different courts different jurisdictions

468
00:28:18,750 --> 00:28:22,050
that must complicate tremendously your
your jobs

469
00:28:22,050 --> 00:28:25,240
and when you're free to comment on that
and the second question

470
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:28,800
is a.m. traffic analysis is

471
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:32,710
is a you know big threat to any users is
this a

472
00:28:32,710 --> 00:28:35,840
newspaper reporter whatever journalist

473
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:40,550
when you do support to these people do
you do it all through tour

474
00:28:40,550 --> 00:28:45,250
or is it public because our aren't the
officials going to be able to trace that

475
00:28:45,250 --> 00:28:45,810
a

476
00:28:45,810 --> 00:28:49,330
a news reporter from some were sent
something to

477
00:28:49,330 --> 00:28:52,429
global week's top carmine and so for

478
00:28:52,429 --> 00:28:55,550
those mature Bush up okay a.m.

479
00:28:55,550 --> 00:29:00,450
to start with your comment on secured a
drop for slogan

480
00:29:00,450 --> 00:29:03,659
global leaks I think there was also a
bit away a

481
00:29:03,659 --> 00:29:07,640
joke in in that we wanted to make clear
to you that

482
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:12,030
we don't see a one is better than yet
other but just wanted to

483
00:29:12,030 --> 00:29:15,830
show you that's both have their
difference

484
00:29:15,830 --> 00:29:20,340
use cases a sexists and they complement
each other

485
00:29:20,340 --> 00:29:23,409
I think it's great that they're two
platforms that provide provide a lot

486
00:29:23,409 --> 00:29:24,250
more robust

487
00:29:24,250 --> 00:29:27,370
nurse than 1i think there's space enough
for that

488
00:29:27,370 --> 00:29:31,540
a.m. as to the press room and an LOA

489
00:29:31,540 --> 00:29:35,510
a common question a yeah a.m.

490
00:29:35,510 --> 00:29:39,510
I would recommend everybody was starting
a platform to really do look

491
00:29:39,510 --> 00:29:43,900
into legal the but also political

492
00:29:43,900 --> 00:29:47,540
situations of where you're working %uh

493
00:29:47,540 --> 00:29:50,850
and make decisions based on that so if

494
00:29:50,850 --> 00:29:54,860
if the law is in such a way that you
could use this to

495
00:29:54,860 --> 00:29:59,000
putting the stuff into a press room im
in protecting it more

496
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:03,390
%uh then that's a a great way of doing
it is it's in a way hacking

497
00:30:03,390 --> 00:30:08,070
the hacking the legal and a a political
system

498
00:30:08,070 --> 00:30:11,440
afford a means of what you want to
achieve

499
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:14,760
as a project a.m. and

500
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:18,010
Denali few with Trevor traffic traffic

501
00:30:18,010 --> 00:30:23,280
mush arm yes I'll traffic analysis into
law

502
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:29,230
I

503
00:30:29,230 --> 00:30:32,660
like I guess the kind of thing is is
that if's ever by the

504
00:30:32,660 --> 00:30:36,000
or a lot of more people where you store
ants

505
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:39,800
I make it so that if you don't know that
all routes Obama is talking about every

506
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:40,770
once in a while

507
00:30:40,770 --> 00:30:43,980
you creates cover traffic for a lot of
different people

508
00:30:43,980 --> 00:30:47,670
I'm and them I we have the other side
the stats

509
00:30:47,670 --> 00:30:52,500
I'm if am to all was only be used by
activists and journalists

510
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:56,010
that it would be really easy to spot
these people so

511
00:30:56,010 --> 00:31:00,490
you know like I guess that law
enforcement another kind of

512
00:31:00,490 --> 00:31:07,110
I'm scary people and she also use this
tool because it creates diversity in the

513
00:31:07,110 --> 00:31:09,470
kind of traffic that this being put out
by either

514
00:31:09,470 --> 00:31:13,470
at war network as a whole or the axle
notes or

515
00:31:13,470 --> 00:31:17,270
adn in this case most the time it stays
within that war

516
00:31:17,270 --> 00:31:20,880
networks I'm so it got so it doesn't go
out

517
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:25,100
on the Internet it stays with him and
that's why because as a token service

518
00:31:25,100 --> 00:31:29,350
so I guess you could see the traffic
analysis but we try to beat dads

519
00:31:29,350 --> 00:31:32,470
arm problem by

520
00:31:32,470 --> 00:31:35,640
I'm trying to love you its

521
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:38,860
the data retention I'm locks in the
Netherlands

522
00:31:38,860 --> 00:31:42,750
even though the date or a $10,000 has
been betrayed

523
00:31:42,750 --> 00:31:47,500
legal in Europe arm that's government
dance to it more that for the time being

524
00:31:47,500 --> 00:31:48,050
and

525
00:31:48,050 --> 00:31:51,530
goes wrong I'll with the veterans and
stuff even though

526
00:31:51,530 --> 00:31:55,560
I'm trucks and between host we don't
lock a lot of things

527
00:31:55,560 --> 00:31:58,850
and if we don't mock a lot of things we
don't like

528
00:31:58,850 --> 00:32:02,440
we we coming if the loss anyway arm is

529
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:06,000
it's called data retention right so if
you don't have it you can't keep it

530
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:10,660
the outsell the less you lost a brother
it is so

531
00:32:10,660 --> 00:32:15,590
there are always two make it harder for
them not impossible but definitely more

532
00:32:15,590 --> 00:32:16,070
holla

533
00:32:16,070 --> 00:32:19,830
I think security is all about raising
the bar and the cost

534
00:32:19,830 --> 00:32:25,500
many many thanks for everything you're
doing this is an exciting presentation

535
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:29,950
the big problem for whistleblowers in a
whistleblower is on the client and

536
00:32:29,950 --> 00:32:34,020
because toward is not guna damn good
good if there's some safety locking

537
00:32:34,020 --> 00:32:34,680
device

538
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:37,690
on your I PCR everything you're doing

539
00:32:37,690 --> 00:32:40,860
and if you were the major bank and
they're worried about what you might say

540
00:32:40,860 --> 00:32:42,550
union have to blow the whistle

541
00:32:42,550 --> 00:32:46,590
but they're worried about you being
tracked and probably by the same

542
00:32:46,590 --> 00:32:47,630
contractors

543
00:32:47,630 --> 00:32:50,780
later are supporting systems for the NSA

544
00:32:50,780 --> 00:32:54,240
so that's what you're faced with and
where do you go

545
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:58,370
to access these wonderful systems unit
you developing

546
00:32:58,370 --> 00:33:01,480
and one other things that I would really
love to see would be

547
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:06,100
something like arm tales running on a
Raspberry Pi

548
00:33:06,100 --> 00:33:10,180
a stripped-down system where people
could walk in room have a fun trip I

549
00:33:10,180 --> 00:33:12,270
sitting there are a bunch in SD cards

550
00:33:12,270 --> 00:33:16,090
everybody swaps them you only put eighty
our wifi

551
00:33:16,090 --> 00:33:20,870
I nibbling when you need it and nobody
knows who's on the other end

552
00:33:20,870 --> 00:33:24,380
and then you're always using public wifi
because

553
00:33:24,380 --> 00:33:27,550
its it's great you have all these things
but

554
00:33:27,550 --> 00:33:31,090
you it's the client and we really have
to strengthen

555
00:33:31,090 --> 00:33:34,220
and I find a way do are make it
completely anonymous

556
00:33:34,220 --> 00:33:37,580
thank you brower failure thank you

557
00:33:37,580 --> 00:33:41,710
for your comment a.m. I i think that's
that's a great comment

558
00:33:41,710 --> 00:33:46,670
and I think there are some projects out
there actually to use hardware devices

559
00:33:46,670 --> 00:33:47,400
which makes

560
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:50,640
it a lot easier for people to the

561
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:55,030
to work with things like tore so for
instance there's

562
00:33:55,030 --> 00:33:58,170
I think it's called tale spy the

563
00:33:58,170 --> 00:34:02,770
which is tales doesn't work on a ram

564
00:34:02,770 --> 00:34:07,210
devices only works X 86 and Lex 86-yard

565
00:34:07,210 --> 00:34:11,000
the only had that karnal sorry tales
them a torque by

566
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:14,260
excuse me on your mind yeah or yet there
is a

567
00:34:14,260 --> 00:34:18,230
there is a divisive actually routes that
you could plug into your laptop

568
00:34:18,230 --> 00:34:21,800
and that's routes the truck traffic
overt or even without an East

569
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:27,010
getting installed but that still makes
you unique that stand out from the crowd

570
00:34:27,010 --> 00:34:29,230
if you're caught with one you have on
your desk

571
00:34:29,230 --> 00:34:32,410
you want something we can be completely
anonymous and look are you could have

572
00:34:32,410 --> 00:34:33,940
been your favorite robot

573
00:34:33,940 --> 00:34:37,790
and I just pull out pull the power hi
out and use it for your communications

574
00:34:37,790 --> 00:34:39,530
when you need it

575
00:34:39,530 --> 00:34:42,580
I mean yes but mmm

576
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:47,830
I guess we're now really talking about
I'm kind of nation-state adversary

577
00:34:47,830 --> 00:34:51,850
amway pass I guess muscle the
whistleblower stone half

578
00:34:51,850 --> 00:34:55,380
I mean up all the whistleblowers saw
working for the NSA

579
00:34:55,380 --> 00:35:00,790
or conferences has a but I mean its it's
hot enough for people oftentimes to

580
00:35:00,790 --> 00:35:03,780
install something like a tall grass
around all about having

581
00:35:03,780 --> 00:35:07,020
archival special device to make that
happen

582
00:35:07,020 --> 00:35:11,840
I guess where r years away for making
that happen I would like to see

583
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:15,800
I'm deals being and make more

584
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:19,830
easy to install on USB sticks and are
being tracked by

585
00:35:19,830 --> 00:35:23,260
I'm DMZ is cool and then being called an
extremist

586
00:35:23,260 --> 00:35:28,040
I take offense of the answer

587
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:32,440
you you mentioned that to German re
mailer solution

588
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:36,290
was much more secure for the receiver
than the sender

589
00:35:36,290 --> 00:35:41,200
so just looking at some %uh the
techniques you talked about with

590
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:44,560
the in cryptogram and so forth and so on

591
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:48,260
I guess the idea of creating some kind
of secure sandbox

592
00:35:48,260 --> 00:35:51,920
arm do you have that on both ends adieu

593
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:55,270
try to maintain the same level security
on both sides

594
00:35:55,270 --> 00:35:58,810
because in a lot to use cases the arm

595
00:35:58,810 --> 00:36:04,030
what you call the weaker the sender
maybe collaborating with another person

596
00:36:04,030 --> 00:36:08,670
who's the receiver and then maybe maybe
that's the lawyer in the middle who

597
00:36:08,670 --> 00:36:11,670
are is providing the protection and
might

598
00:36:11,670 --> 00:36:17,370
then room react the information and
Richard send it back to the leaker

599
00:36:17,370 --> 00:36:20,570
you know the two with Mr Cooper we doing
an investigation

600
00:36:20,570 --> 00:36:23,650
with you whatever you want to call a
Chinese walls

601
00:36:23,650 --> 00:36:27,280
so those two parties have the same
similar

602
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:30,530
capabilities orders one have lesser more
crews

603
00:36:30,530 --> 00:36:34,230
I think they'll be the same person
that's why I asked so

604
00:36:34,230 --> 00:36:37,450
I would say thats a its usually

605
00:36:37,450 --> 00:36:41,230
its its a lot harder easier to

606
00:36:41,230 --> 00:36:45,200
have better security on the receiving
end and on the sending and

607
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:49,700
because a on the receiving end we can do
things like

608
00:36:49,700 --> 00:36:55,010
the mandatory training rights we say you
have to receive the training as a

609
00:36:55,010 --> 00:36:58,320
journalist in Kampar become part of his
platform in this is

610
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:02,440
for multiple reasons right it's it's
also to have a better protection for the

611
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:04,790
one who is leaking the information

612
00:37:04,790 --> 00:37:07,880
parts the we cannot

613
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:11,530
it's very hearts other than through the
up the trap site itself

614
00:37:11,530 --> 00:37:15,160
in in providing information there in 20
people to the right resources

615
00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:19,110
it is very hard to up front

616
00:37:19,110 --> 00:37:22,690
training to whistleblower so a.m.

617
00:37:22,690 --> 00:37:26,960
yeah I I i'm not gonna say that it is
the same because

618
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:30,660
weeks it's impossible to to have it the
same okay cuz when you talk about

619
00:37:30,660 --> 00:37:32,440
multiple use cases

620
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:36,760
I was listening to an NGO saying you
know I get worried when I collect

621
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:37,740
information

622
00:37:37,740 --> 00:37:43,190
in this country and maybe use case for
them is they collect the information

623
00:37:43,190 --> 00:37:46,260
leak it treated as if it's a weak pop it
up

624
00:37:46,260 --> 00:37:51,400
someone read actually cleaning up ships
it back they open it up in their secure

625
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:55,410
or our values cases without your sample
I think

626
00:37:55,410 --> 00:37:59,100
to helping transform switch has been
doing this s the kind of like

627
00:37:59,100 --> 00:38:02,160
whitewashing information is to gather
information

628
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:07,040
true and other source crew in a way and
they uploaded to the spot for men say

629
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:09,910
I don't know where it came from I don't
know there was a moment I had it for the

630
00:38:09,910 --> 00:38:11,350
Scout form

631
00:38:11,350 --> 00:38:14,180
you know nope I'm kidnapping their
purchases where possible overnight

632
00:38:14,180 --> 00:38:15,040
delivery

633
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:19,140
sanctions I have a couple of comments

634
00:38:19,140 --> 00:38:22,460
on the question that the lady over there
pose earlier

635
00:38:22,460 --> 00:38:26,570
and then to a question for you as well I
used to work for a bank so

636
00:38:26,570 --> 00:38:29,830
I have an idea of a what you're talking
about

637
00:38:29,830 --> 00:38:33,150
and you mention raspberry PIs but if
you're concerned about keeping a low

638
00:38:33,150 --> 00:38:34,280
profile

639
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:41,180
arm I think yup walking into a bank with
the Raspberry Pi

640
00:38:41,180 --> 00:38:44,900
well he the I think in our culture

641
00:38:44,900 --> 00:38:48,040
going anywhere right now the Raspberry
Pi outside to some place like this

642
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:49,330
attracts attention

643
00:38:49,330 --> 00:38:53,440
I think I think a better alternative
would be to repurpose a smartphone

644
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:58,430
are basically rip-off you know
completely wipe out the Android platform

645
00:38:58,430 --> 00:39:02,170
issues the hardware and stick something
on top of that

646
00:39:02,170 --> 00:39:06,500
it looks like an everyday item Raspberry
Pi may be normal to us but it's not an

647
00:39:06,500 --> 00:39:07,830
everyday item

648
00:39:07,830 --> 00:39:11,860
outside love her this room I think be
better to repurpose something like a

649
00:39:11,860 --> 00:39:14,730
smartphone war or something that looks
like a camera

650
00:39:14,730 --> 00:39:18,040
something that that really looks more
more

651
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:21,830
harmless then Raspberry Pi and get
nothing to be concerned about

652
00:39:21,830 --> 00:39:25,630
if you're especially her in a large
corporation like a a

653
00:39:25,630 --> 00:39:32,630
like a a bank is not just the

654
00:39:36,990 --> 00:39:40,700
looks little bit more suspicious
messages I just think everything is in

655
00:39:40,700 --> 00:39:43,200
distt to keylogging software you also
have to

656
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:47,349
be concerned about data leakage
prevention software

657
00:39:47,349 --> 00:39:51,880
which is unjust a which is not just
capturing your keystrokes

658
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:55,880
but is keeping track of what you're
looking at and a

659
00:39:55,880 --> 00:40:00,190
I am in which he doing with that which
is you another discussion tirely

660
00:40:00,190 --> 00:40:03,839
my question for you is nom are you aware
of any

661
00:40:03,839 --> 00:40:07,380
comprehensive work better attempt to
build a comprehensive

662
00:40:07,380 --> 00:40:10,760
upset a like a training course

663
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:15,510
for for journalists that isn't
platform-specific like just you know

664
00:40:15,510 --> 00:40:18,650
you mention a couple of platforms here
and how they have their own

665
00:40:18,650 --> 00:40:23,170
training material on how to use the
platform but are you where the knee

666
00:40:23,170 --> 00:40:27,089
attempt to develop like it almost like a
college course an object

667
00:40:27,089 --> 00:40:31,060
training course that's more
comprehensive I think there's something

668
00:40:31,060 --> 00:40:32,220
by the committee

669
00:40:32,220 --> 00:40:35,990
the committee of protecting journalists
them the CPG

670
00:40:35,990 --> 00:40:39,710
which have been doing something similar
in other bouts only

671
00:40:39,710 --> 00:40:43,220
digital security but also about I am

672
00:40:43,220 --> 00:40:46,510
physical security and workout tension
into what's out for

673
00:40:46,510 --> 00:40:50,490
and going into I'm I'm

674
00:40:50,490 --> 00:40:56,420
more dangerous areas like like was arms
and and I have stuff and then we half

675
00:40:56,420 --> 00:41:00,569
decals I'm guide slide and security in
the box

676
00:41:00,569 --> 00:41:03,880
was a psycho digital security thing I am

677
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:07,170
so these do these things can affect this
but they don't really complement each

678
00:41:07,170 --> 00:41:10,579
other because most of the time they
elect and different organizations are

679
00:41:10,579 --> 00:41:12,720
doing the same thing and are doing this
and work

680
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:16,480
without contributing to existing guides
so there's a lot of

681
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:20,780
I'll size for I also think that had a
problem there is the best place where

682
00:41:20,780 --> 00:41:22,599
you want to have this is actually in
schools

683
00:41:22,599 --> 00:41:27,740
journalism and there has been a it's
very hard I have contacted some people

684
00:41:27,740 --> 00:41:29,380
and some schools are doing it

685
00:41:29,380 --> 00:41:32,420
but usually if you get something in the
clock

686
00:41:32,420 --> 00:41:36,089
curriculum than something else has to
get out so

687
00:41:36,089 --> 00:41:40,119
this a is gonna be a this is gonna be a
long

688
00:41:40,119 --> 00:41:44,250
long way but we've been trying to work
on it locally so in the Netherlands to

689
00:41:44,250 --> 00:41:45,550
get this kinda stuff im

690
00:41:45,550 --> 00:41:49,810
and I hope other people are also trying
that to do that with their local schools

691
00:41:49,810 --> 00:41:50,660
for journalism

692
00:41:50,660 --> 00:41:53,200
yeah they are actually doing something
at the Center for Investigative

693
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:55,150
Journalism in on them

694
00:41:55,150 --> 00:41:58,680
arm where there have been driving a
similar kind of God's

695
00:41:58,680 --> 00:42:01,900
as which has been giving at the
University in on them

696
00:42:01,900 --> 00:42:05,609
from rights the fam yeah ca

697
