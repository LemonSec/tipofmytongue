1
00:00:01,180 --> 00:00:07,379
when see

2
00:00:07,379 --> 00:00:14,379
low very

3
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:18,630
now welcomed might talk about poisoning

4
00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:25,630
well i cant kinga

5
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:33,880
poisoning in your life is not like you
see in movies & Tea

6
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:38,090
I

7
00:00:38,090 --> 00:00:43,620
media doesn't per

8
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:50,620
there's only a few drops all right hand

9
00:00:51,130 --> 00:00:54,620
you heat its better

10
00:00:54,620 --> 00:01:01,590
no I would have been instant death as I
and taken it's actually kinda hard to

11
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:02,320
see my notes

12
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:06,180
well I'm gonna get into a little bit
about poisons really work

13
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:13,180
mom smiling

14
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:19,840
sorry me keyboard means

15
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:26,470
mister

16
00:01:26,470 --> 00:01:33,470
saleable have technical difficulty year
very don't do it this way

17
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:38,550
better im a pharmacist and I like
toxicology

18
00:01:38,550 --> 00:01:41,650
hi did a couple rotations on a date
other

19
00:01:41,650 --> 00:01:44,830
poison center and one at a hospital

20
00:01:44,830 --> 00:01:49,930
and the thing I one thing I like about
toxicology is

21
00:01:49,930 --> 00:01:54,400
arm not talking to people by dogle
normal person

22
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:58,010
and I say well you know up similar to
have lunch or

23
00:01:58,010 --> 00:02:01,650
rat poison may be okay for a few days
early but

24
00:02:01,650 --> 00:02:04,780
then they'd start to have internal
bleeding

25
00:02:04,780 --> 00:02:08,290
and Nate get me makin low blood pressure
and if they

26
00:02:08,290 --> 00:02:12,780
survived the hemorrhaging a wood need
vitamin K for several months

27
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:17,150
and reaction from a normal person might
be a

28
00:02:17,150 --> 00:02:23,150
why do you know that an

29
00:02:23,150 --> 00:02:26,810
and is a strange because it's like why
why do you know

30
00:02:26,810 --> 00:02:30,200
a certain piece of knowledge well

31
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:34,530
but in toxicology I don't get that
question

32
00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:38,110
a question I do like when people ask why

33
00:02:38,110 --> 00:02:41,220
no idea present at a hacker conference

34
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:46,250
someone is because a lower body is a
biochemical system

35
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:49,730
there's an analogy up acting arm

36
00:02:49,730 --> 00:02:53,459
because chemicals can hijacker these

37
00:02:53,459 --> 00:02:57,010
chemical processes or change them some

38
00:02:57,010 --> 00:03:00,940
so basically you know chemistry can
pakula body

39
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:06,670
although more importantly I like talking
it hope I've done it a couple times now

40
00:03:06,670 --> 00:03:11,590
up because you guys are really
interested in knowing how stuff works

41
00:03:11,590 --> 00:03:15,780
and it's really the knowledge that is
important

42
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:19,750
I think from oh yes and

43
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:23,570
I'll introduce this is my favorite
hacker

44
00:03:23,570 --> 00:03:26,760
it's a cold virus because it I'll

45
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:30,780
attach is to receptors in your nose and
throat which makes not

46
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:34,950
and was not as full a virus is and then
it spreads around

47
00:03:34,950 --> 00:03:40,090
so it had access to survive good

48
00:03:40,090 --> 00:03:46,459
want is so

49
00:03:46,459 --> 00:03:50,930
really it's a bell understanding how
system works a biochemical system

50
00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:54,430
all the body and I'm going to go into
some

51
00:03:54,430 --> 00:03:59,380
more examples some just general starring
generally

52
00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:03,209
Theresia perception versus reality
obviously you don't have

53
00:04:03,209 --> 00:04:07,940
instant death from poisons I a lot times
urs not an antidote

54
00:04:07,940 --> 00:04:11,760
or there will be an antidote but we
won't use it to treat

55
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:15,340
some and you don't really get that

56
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:18,510
instant painless death that some people
might

57
00:04:18,510 --> 00:04:23,960
imagine an auto

58
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:27,180
hello poisons actually bring down the
system in

59
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:31,350
has to do with homie Oso de ses which is
basically the balance

60
00:04:31,350 --> 00:04:35,760
up the body now means some soldiers
metaphor

61
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:39,110
goal Baildon balance

62
00:04:39,110 --> 00:04:42,889
there's very specific parameters that
the body

63
00:04:42,889 --> 00:04:46,360
is always keeping itself within mom

64
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:50,730
at any given time in response like the
firemen changes but the body needs to

65
00:04:50,730 --> 00:04:51,350
stay

66
00:04:51,350 --> 00:04:54,590
the same Armenia be flexible to changes

67
00:04:54,590 --> 00:04:58,700
and you know I've listed some things
that keeps in balance

68
00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:03,599
on you know including even water IVF too
much water it can become

69
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:06,870
toxic because too much are tickets and
the cells

70
00:05:06,870 --> 00:05:11,570
and they can burst mom soho means de ses
is very

71
00:05:11,570 --> 00:05:15,960
important some so

72
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:21,570
long way that poisons can disrupt that
despite damaging certain organs

73
00:05:21,570 --> 00:05:22,320
especially

74
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:26,810
the liver and kidneys delivers involved
in a whole lot of things

75
00:05:26,810 --> 00:05:29,900
arm from include close to clotting and

76
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:33,220
a it in the water balance digestion

77
00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:37,370
arm meal detox a

78
00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:42,330
so tylenol there's a perception that
maybe

79
00:05:42,330 --> 00:05:45,700
alot take the whole bottle a my I

80
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:48,760
you know go to sleep in just never wake
up

81
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:52,960
and this is couldn't be farther from the
truth

82
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:58,350
%uh there's actually a delayed toxicity
with Tylenol

83
00:05:58,350 --> 00:06:01,380
paracetamol is another name for the drug

84
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:05,840
acetaminophen it's in the top left there
and its metabolized into different

85
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:06,990
things

86
00:06:06,990 --> 00:06:11,250
the one on the bottom left nappy is a
toxic metabolite

87
00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:14,350
and that damages liver cells thankfully

88
00:06:14,350 --> 00:06:17,890
our body has %uh glued if I own orgias

89
00:06:17,890 --> 00:06:21,780
H which cleans up the tab key normally

90
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:25,990
but in a large overdose %uh there isn't
enough

91
00:06:25,990 --> 00:06:29,520
GS a chick gets depleted mom

92
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:33,030
and so sometimes all someone all like

93
00:06:33,030 --> 00:06:36,770
take update overdose of Tylenol and
although

94
00:06:36,770 --> 00:06:41,050
I'll feel OK you know a first-day will
be like I didn't work

95
00:06:41,050 --> 00:06:47,170
by changed my mind arm and then the
second AAA might start to feel sick

96
00:06:47,170 --> 00:06:50,620
other and then miles third day they're
really sick in the end

97
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:53,870
end up in the hospital by that time the

98
00:06:53,870 --> 00:06:58,380
antidote which I'll talk about a minute
doesn't have much of a chance to work

99
00:06:58,380 --> 00:07:02,930
other hand seller on the liver
transplant list in ICU on supportive

100
00:07:02,930 --> 00:07:04,290
care

101
00:07:04,290 --> 00:07:08,510
it can get messy arm

102
00:07:08,510 --> 00:07:11,570
the antidote is called Anna Segal
sistine

103
00:07:11,570 --> 00:07:16,450
and basically it promotes the production
of GSH

104
00:07:16,450 --> 00:07:20,980
a and is most effective before the

105
00:07:20,980 --> 00:07:26,180
mom before the damage is done

106
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:30,020
some did anybody go to the

107
00:07:30,020 --> 00:07:34,090
by all hacking last night

108
00:07:34,090 --> 00:07:38,590
cool nom when they hear talked about you
know printing out organs and

109
00:07:38,590 --> 00:07:41,990
such I think the liver would actually be
good one to start with

110
00:07:41,990 --> 00:07:45,120
because it's got they can regenerate

111
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:49,350
very well and if at the hospital you can
get the person through

112
00:07:49,350 --> 00:07:52,560
like if you can keep them alive and keep
them from going into

113
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:56,240
multiple organ failure after this
overdose

114
00:07:56,240 --> 00:08:00,820
liberal role actually recover quite well

115
00:08:00,820 --> 00:08:05,400
um another thing to deal with Isla
kidneys

116
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:08,650
on so there we wondered about any freeze

117
00:08:08,650 --> 00:08:13,560
a it's got some toxic metabolites again
it's not it's also it's toxic it's the

118
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:14,690
metabolites

119
00:08:14,690 --> 00:08:18,190
and they crystallize at the kidneys
doing damage

120
00:08:18,190 --> 00:08:22,860
on and it's got an interesting interred
ok

121
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:26,590
%uh good old ethanol

122
00:08:26,590 --> 00:08:30,350
a basically weapons is the any freeze
gets

123
00:08:30,350 --> 00:08:34,649
metabolized by the same enzyme that
metabolizes ethanol

124
00:08:34,649 --> 00:08:37,959
and so the ideas are used to be

125
00:08:37,959 --> 00:08:41,130
overwhelm that pathway arm you give them

126
00:08:41,130 --> 00:08:46,779
you get them drunk enough and and they
won't get toxicity for many freeze cuz

127
00:08:46,779 --> 00:08:50,860
it'll eventually get excreted and

128
00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:55,440
name but there are law side effects
because you have to keep them at a blood

129
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:56,640
alcohol level

130
00:08:56,640 --> 00:09:00,500
.1 2.15 a

131
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:04,670
Jersey on average maybe like slamming
five shots

132
00:09:04,670 --> 00:09:07,750
a and you have to keep them at that
level

133
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:11,269
more a long time until all the
antifreeze is gone

134
00:09:11,269 --> 00:09:14,380
it could be help could be if the dais

135
00:09:14,380 --> 00:09:17,760
her

136
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:22,180
still think believe we do have a droid
now that works as an antidote as well

137
00:09:22,180 --> 00:09:25,480
inhibits the enzyme without actually

138
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:30,230
dealing with all those side effects

139
00:09:30,230 --> 00:09:34,060
so no other way to bring a system down
obviously need to breed

140
00:09:34,060 --> 00:09:38,639
and to use oxygen a so some examples
are:

141
00:09:38,639 --> 00:09:41,910
a new drugs that slowdown breeding like

142
00:09:41,910 --> 00:09:47,649
opiates India heroin morphine benzo die
is at pains like valium

143
00:09:47,649 --> 00:09:50,690
on there are things that stop your
breathing

144
00:09:50,690 --> 00:09:54,830
like your're tetrodotoxin which is
little girl fetish

145
00:09:54,830 --> 00:09:58,200
toxin I love they basically paralyze you

146
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:03,590
and that includes your diaphragm so on
self you just stop reading

147
00:10:03,590 --> 00:10:06,800
obviously stop getting oxygen I'll but

148
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:11,410
artificial respiration all help keep you
live in that case

149
00:10:11,410 --> 00:10:15,370
there's on that interfere with email
ability of oxygen

150
00:10:15,370 --> 00:10:19,240
carbon monoxide are basically in your
blood

151
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:23,080
oxygens carried by hemoglobin but
Kharbanda not

152
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:27,470
carbon monoxide will buy into that
displays the oxygen

153
00:10:27,470 --> 00:10:32,010
will pick it out arm and then there's
wonder if you're interfere with

154
00:10:32,010 --> 00:10:34,190
respiration on a cellular level

155
00:10:34,190 --> 00:10:37,500
and that cyanide problem

156
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:40,770
on a cellular level %uh this

157
00:10:40,770 --> 00:10:44,300
graph looks kinda complicated but you
can they give it is a hydroelectric

158
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:45,080
generator

159
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:50,130
except with electrons instead of water
there's a flow from left to right here

160
00:10:50,130 --> 00:10:54,420
electrons and on the right that ATP
synthetase

161
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:57,920
over there it actually turns physically

162
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:01,990
and generates the energy for your cell
Tom

163
00:11:01,990 --> 00:11:05,880
and cyanide will inhibit the

164
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:09,140
complex for the Purple Line

165
00:11:09,140 --> 00:11:12,940
mom and basically stopped the flow

166
00:11:12,940 --> 00:11:19,130
a so starts the generation energy

167
00:11:19,130 --> 00:11:23,020
and carbon monoxide sign i tre called
the toxic twins

168
00:11:23,020 --> 00:11:27,360
world smoke inhalation guess whenever
someone's an umpire

169
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:31,160
they're both a big concern with carbon
monoxide

170
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:34,900
you can get the person lots and lots of
oxygen a

171
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:38,150
an attempt to get them get some oxygen

172
00:11:38,150 --> 00:11:43,740
on that hemoglobin I'm if you do after
sign I did that's not going to work

173
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:48,589
but thankfully we have a vitamin b12

174
00:11:48,589 --> 00:11:52,320
it in its different forms hydroxy alkyl
Balaban

175
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:56,720
on you can give that and it'll bind up
the cyanide

176
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:59,960
and here near alternate I heard the

177
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:06,960
cyanocobalamin is not toxic at all

178
00:12:07,050 --> 00:12:10,880
so moving on to the heart %uh this is
river phoenix

179
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:14,890
and a skinny uses a his a is an actor

180
00:12:14,890 --> 00:12:18,390
who overdosed money he was 23

181
00:12:18,390 --> 00:12:22,210
I'm back in nineteen ninety-three from
and his

182
00:12:22,210 --> 00:12:27,500
a the the cause of death was acute
multiple drug intoxication

183
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:31,940
com what happened as he went to a
nightclub any was be balling

184
00:12:31,940 --> 00:12:37,100
apparently I'll which is a mix of heroin
and cocaine

185
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:41,450
I am and he was feeling sick and also
took some valium

186
00:12:41,450 --> 00:12:45,920
and eclipse outside the club and was
having seizures

187
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:49,250
the paramedics arrived around 1:30 a.m.
are

188
00:12:49,250 --> 00:12:52,450
they started giving CPR he'd already

189
00:12:52,450 --> 00:12:56,430
flatline and I'll make a note about CPR

190
00:12:56,430 --> 00:13:01,290
arm its actually you legally give it
when the person is in

191
00:13:01,290 --> 00:13:05,600
very bad shape they're not breathing and
they've got no pulse

192
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:10,110
um and it's really the active again is
now ITV worry just

193
00:13:10,110 --> 00:13:14,330
like gently press on their chest after
early press down because you're

194
00:13:14,330 --> 00:13:19,370
physically squeezing the heart in a
desperate attempt to get blood

195
00:13:19,370 --> 00:13:24,960
to circulate and to keep that person's
brain alive by getting some blood

196
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:28,820
into the brain and the rest their body
when their heart

197
00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:32,020
can't do it hustles is good success rate

198
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:35,779
you need to do it but the sisters
successor a is

199
00:13:35,779 --> 00:13:38,820
very low and there was a successful in
this case

200
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:42,250
obviously but to start the heart again
you need

201
00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:46,399
either some drugs arm and

202
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:49,440
the elders shocking but I

203
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:53,160
you don't shock it clearly get the
persons are started

204
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:56,200
with a shocking but stopped well

205
00:13:56,200 --> 00:14:00,029
so like like MTV if their heart's not
beating

206
00:14:00,029 --> 00:14:03,279
arm mio 18

207
00:14:03,279 --> 00:14:08,140
try CPR and and certain drugs but

208
00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:13,080
Tom let's not likely to be successful
unfortunately

209
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:17,860
I am me arrived at the hospital 1:34
a.m. and was pronounced dead

210
00:14:17,860 --> 00:14:22,149
about 20 minutes later muscle autopsy
found

211
00:14:22,149 --> 00:14:25,540
morphine which is a metabolite of heroin
a

212
00:14:25,540 --> 00:14:29,380
cocaine days up and that's a valium

213
00:14:29,380 --> 00:14:32,890
a metabolite a marijuana single veteran

214
00:14:32,890 --> 00:14:36,700
and ephedrine which could have been
contaminants in the cocaine or

215
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:41,339
cold medication from so there are a lot
of drugs in her system

216
00:14:41,339 --> 00:14:44,560
and the levels of cocaine and heroin in
particular were both

217
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:48,250
very high so they ruled it acute the
elder like we all know

218
00:14:48,250 --> 00:14:53,100
killed them looking is as a toxicologist

219
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:57,390
mom as I talked about before with the
breeding in respiration

220
00:14:57,390 --> 00:15:02,339
a heroine and belly am if they would
have been toxic they would have

221
00:15:02,339 --> 00:15:05,850
children by slowing is breeding on the
other hand

222
00:15:05,850 --> 00:15:09,899
a his heart was stopped on an seizures
that's very typical

223
00:15:09,899 --> 00:15:15,450
of cocaine and stimulants I am so that's
really what killed him

224
00:15:15,450 --> 00:15:19,860
arm interesting the vet interestingly
the belly him

225
00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:23,620
is one thing she would have been is slow
things you might have been a type a drug

226
00:15:23,620 --> 00:15:25,140
he would have been treated

227
00:15:25,140 --> 00:15:28,220
well with in the hospital be bitten

228
00:15:28,220 --> 00:15:31,260
feet survived longer it was actually

229
00:15:31,260 --> 00:15:34,510
the right thing to take but it was too
little

230
00:15:34,510 --> 00:15:38,020
%ah the cocaine was way too much

231
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:42,670
for whatever small amount of World deli
in here ed

232
00:15:42,670 --> 00:15:47,560
a Miller toxicity that he would never
had to worry about back 93

233
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:51,600
but is moreover a problem now is the
Bama Sol

234
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:54,990
into drug that is eased against worms

235
00:15:54,990 --> 00:15:59,399
um and it's in the local keen and

236
00:15:59,399 --> 00:16:04,589
the US a as of 2011 it was in over 80
percent

237
00:16:04,589 --> 00:16:09,040
I going Tom I couldn't find a more
recent number for that

238
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:14,680
%uh but below cocaine it's actually cut
be four cups to the country

239
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:18,490
and it seems to have some enhancing
effects on a cocaine

240
00:16:18,490 --> 00:16:23,480
unfortunately they can cause some
heavy-duty immune system failure

241
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:26,660
and skin toxicity I

242
00:16:26,660 --> 00:16:31,149
could have found some I illustrations
for the skin toxicity but

243
00:16:31,149 --> 00:16:34,920
they were pretty gross so I'm with the
xkcd

244
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:41,410
is xkcd guy I'm just showing you a
squirrel's

245
00:16:41,410 --> 00:16:46,120
and so but nervous system

246
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:49,120
toxicities I we've got

247
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:53,080
what with the cases are stimulants
you've got the sympathetic nervous

248
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:54,269
system

249
00:16:54,269 --> 00:16:59,060
which is the fight-or-flight a and thats
activated by stimulants

250
00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:03,029
and you've got the parasympathetic
nervous system which is the rest and

251
00:17:03,029 --> 00:17:04,350
digest

252
00:17:04,350 --> 00:17:09,439
you don't hear about that as much but
it's very common disease toxicities

253
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:12,959
arm anticholinergic because it involves
the

254
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:16,380
neuro transmitters either calling mom

255
00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:22,079
Tylenol PM weary talked about the
acetaminophen the a Tylenol part

256
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:27,669
arm so here going to concentrate on the
the p.m. which is die for the Hydra mean

257
00:17:27,669 --> 00:17:30,909
also sold urs benadryl 'em

258
00:17:30,909 --> 00:17:34,649
and if you were to take the whole bottle

259
00:17:34,649 --> 00:17:38,519
on you would get again there's a
perception unlike

260
00:17:38,519 --> 00:17:42,669
%uh Tylenol PM if I it took the whole
bottle like shiitake a little bit you

261
00:17:42,669 --> 00:17:43,820
fall asleep

262
00:17:43,820 --> 00:17:47,409
if I take the whole bottle maybe I'd
fall sleep and never wake up

263
00:17:47,409 --> 00:17:51,120
that's not what happens I'll you get

264
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:55,480
anticholinergic toxicity which is the
same kind you flying in deadly

265
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:58,500
nightshade

266
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:04,240
a there's basically a up a bunch of
different so symptoms arm

267
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:07,240
basically have a lot to do with having
very

268
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:11,140
a dried up ale few bodily fluids

269
00:18:11,140 --> 00:18:14,740
the skin is really hot and dry aegean
year

270
00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:18,620
really heated up I'll there's delirium

271
00:18:18,620 --> 00:18:21,790
as in talking to people who aren't there
that's

272
00:18:21,790 --> 00:18:25,840
characteristic on

273
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:29,840
and in a can leaders you know so
hyperthermia

274
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:33,040
love being too hot and seizures and coma

275
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:36,820
Tom in an overdose

276
00:18:36,820 --> 00:18:40,900
in the treatment is generally supportive
care lets a treat for a lot of stuff

277
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:42,790
there actually is an antidote

278
00:18:42,790 --> 00:18:47,970
but it's very short-lived as use more to
diagnose the toxicity

279
00:18:47,970 --> 00:18:51,990
than it is to treat it mom it's called
by sisti

280
00:18:51,990 --> 00:18:57,190
Stig mean I'll reverses the effect but
again it wears off really fast

281
00:18:57,190 --> 00:19:00,360
mom so usually I

282
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:04,000
treat whatever symptoms are needed in
the hospital to keep the person alive

283
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,730
keep them cool

284
00:19:05,730 --> 00:19:09,059
until until their body can clear out

285
00:19:09,059 --> 00:19:13,190
the drug home another common lawn

286
00:19:13,190 --> 00:19:16,400
often AC these two together because ur

287
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:20,700
lot of antidepressants and things that
have up both times a perfect

288
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:25,160
serotonin toxicity or serotonin syndrome

289
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:29,220
I am it's basically a a special type of

290
00:19:29,220 --> 00:19:34,059
the nervous system going haywire I would
too much serotonin activity

291
00:19:34,059 --> 00:19:38,309
com there's love overactive reflexes
tremor

292
00:19:38,309 --> 00:19:41,530
mom ball sounds mom

293
00:19:41,530 --> 00:19:46,510
and also altered mental status not quite
the same as the delirium

294
00:19:46,510 --> 00:19:49,530
you get with the anticholinergics I

295
00:19:49,530 --> 00:19:53,230
owner hyperthermia is a real problem
because

296
00:19:53,230 --> 00:19:56,240
a person's moving like their their
muscles

297
00:19:56,240 --> 00:20:00,270
ago shaking and after several hours so
that there's a real chances

298
00:20:00,270 --> 00:20:03,549
muscle breakdown which also I'll

299
00:20:03,549 --> 00:20:06,600
can cause kidney failure on

300
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:12,040
and that's in addition to the the damage
they can happen from hyperthermia

301
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:17,280
I am and me to basically happen for many

302
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:21,600
I any combination thereof to drugs the
affects serotonin

303
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:25,320
although it's dose-dependent sleazy and
a lot in overdoses

304
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:28,780
but not normally not not a lot and

305
00:20:28,780 --> 00:20:31,920
normal treatment arm

306
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:35,270
me on this case again there's an
antidote

307
00:20:35,270 --> 00:20:39,950
but its coral and if someone is shaking
a lot times that they really bad you

308
00:20:39,950 --> 00:20:41,120
know wanna give it cuz

309
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:45,010
there's a chance they might not be able
to swallow it properly

310
00:20:45,010 --> 00:20:49,090
mom and so usually I V benzo dies at
Peets

311
00:20:49,090 --> 00:20:52,420
are used to calm the body down mom

312
00:20:52,420 --> 00:20:56,390
and and keep people from moving it

313
00:20:56,390 --> 00:21:01,730
I'll and some cases words explain we
have to put them in a drug induced coma

314
00:21:01,730 --> 00:21:04,790
for a while and you maintain everything
and everything

315
00:21:04,790 --> 00:21:08,960
and again it's keep them alive until the
toxicity

316
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:14,320
until her body clears out the poison

317
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:17,690
I am I also want to go over a little bit
about

318
00:21:17,690 --> 00:21:22,230
about acid and bases I and also special
case usually

319
00:21:22,230 --> 00:21:25,290
acids and bases like it to reno

320
00:21:25,290 --> 00:21:28,770
well the to Dolby corrosive

321
00:21:28,770 --> 00:21:32,679
like on direct contact a because sir

322
00:21:32,679 --> 00:21:36,470
directly damaging the cells and you
won't get a systemic

323
00:21:36,470 --> 00:21:40,240
poisoning um but as shown in

324
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:44,320
in this still from a popular TV show

325
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:48,669
on there's one called hydrofluoric acid

326
00:21:48,669 --> 00:21:52,350
a nurse would be prolly toxicologist

327
00:21:52,350 --> 00:21:57,549
nightmare to see this in a any chemistry
lab six judges all the stuff

328
00:21:57,549 --> 00:22:01,309
a because its

329
00:22:01,309 --> 00:22:04,770
it's a week like as far as acids are its

330
00:22:04,770 --> 00:22:08,710
its week um it's considered we could but

331
00:22:08,710 --> 00:22:14,070
are but its special because it can cause
systemic toxicity

332
00:22:14,070 --> 00:22:17,530
on that fluorine

333
00:22:17,530 --> 00:22:21,020
is basically the problem

334
00:22:21,020 --> 00:22:24,620
and I mean can cause burns delayed burns

335
00:22:24,620 --> 00:22:27,990
like male necessarily sharp right away
on a

336
00:22:27,990 --> 00:22:31,450
but like a day later they can show up I
am

337
00:22:31,450 --> 00:22:34,669
and I'm not gonna show some more serious
ones

338
00:22:34,669 --> 00:22:38,929
well you can look them up yourself a

339
00:22:38,929 --> 00:22:43,120
really interesting thing the fluorine
part of hydrofluoric acid

340
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:47,299
will absorb in actually it can eat
through gless

341
00:22:47,299 --> 00:22:51,600
because it's not it's not the S and its
love Lori

342
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:58,510
adult actor Soltan and time

343
00:22:58,510 --> 00:23:02,080
oh yeah it's used a low concentrations
to etch glass

344
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:05,190
on because its special alder St Salt

345
00:23:05,190 --> 00:23:09,669
arm be able to do that but also loves to
mind to calcium

346
00:23:09,669 --> 00:23:14,840
and so can eat through bone I am and it
can absorb in your system in action

347
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:18,230
a bind up the calcium in that one that's
what can cause

348
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:21,330
systemic toxicity I am

349
00:23:21,330 --> 00:23:25,290
me it takes very little like if you were
to ingested

350
00:23:25,290 --> 00:23:29,260
it takes very little to do a lot of
damage even just a

351
00:23:29,260 --> 00:23:34,620
arm 5 percent solution are just a few
ounces could be fatal

352
00:23:34,620 --> 00:23:38,700
I am in results and in cardiac arrest

353
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:45,700
%uh six hours later

354
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:53,740
head her

355
00:23:53,740 --> 00:23:58,430
years so there was a garbage man who

356
00:23:58,430 --> 00:24:01,570
but there is a jug in there and escorted
him

357
00:24:01,570 --> 00:24:05,120
yep year

358
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:12,120
year he

359
00:24:12,530 --> 00:24:17,400
is so i mean thing is it they can be
very toxic in absorbed through the skin

360
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:18,490
to

361
00:24:18,490 --> 00:24:24,170
and especially if its high concentration
if it's a 100 percent concentration

362
00:24:24,170 --> 00:24:27,820
it if it can be fatal if it absorbs
through

363
00:24:27,820 --> 00:24:31,370
2.5 percent of your body surface area

364
00:24:31,370 --> 00:24:35,330
which is about the the serve as a lil
skin covering your hand

365
00:24:35,330 --> 00:24:40,070
so but covers your hand a hundred
percent concentration it can kill you

366
00:24:40,070 --> 00:24:45,300
mom because I'll the calcium intakes of
calcium in your body

367
00:24:45,300 --> 00:24:49,040
um and so and the lower concentrations

368
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:53,000
it's not gonna be like as problematic

369
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:56,770
but can still be give you burns other
treatment is

370
00:24:56,770 --> 00:25:00,640
calcium I'm whether it's a topical

371
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:04,560
or systemic dogle lotsa calcium nitrided

372
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:07,750
bind up with chlorine and keep you from

373
00:25:07,750 --> 00:25:12,160
are you know keep your heart from
stopping mom

374
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:17,810
in the last example I wanted to talk
about

375
00:25:17,810 --> 00:25:22,750
as is actually one of my favorites
because it's a more complicated toxicity

376
00:25:22,750 --> 00:25:27,000
aspirin %uh it just seems like a lot of
different things happen

377
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:31,490
%uh so

378
00:25:31,490 --> 00:25:34,750
I'll for stroller is stimulates in
overdose

379
00:25:34,750 --> 00:25:38,370
it will stimulate the respiratory
centers in your brain stem

380
00:25:38,370 --> 00:25:42,410
well and unknown cause

381
00:25:42,410 --> 00:25:45,580
the patient to hyperventilate breed
really fast

382
00:25:45,580 --> 00:25:49,220
and the reason this is important %uh
outdated

383
00:25:49,220 --> 00:25:53,640
going to build a background as the again
homie host aces

384
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:57,120
the pH in your blood is kept in a very

385
00:25:57,120 --> 00:26:02,170
tight range and two organs actually do
this your lungs in your kidneys

386
00:26:02,170 --> 00:26:06,500
arm and they can compensate for each
other your lungs only take

387
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:10,180
a couple minutes to campus saying in
your kidneys take a few hours

388
00:26:10,180 --> 00:26:13,560
up baby star hyperventilating well

389
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:16,820
your blood pH it will become more basic

390
00:26:16,820 --> 00:26:21,060
less acidic workers you're blowing up a
la carbon dioxide

391
00:26:21,060 --> 00:26:24,880
mom which in your blood gets converted
to carbonic acid

392
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:28,750
I am so a but if you ordered

393
00:26:28,750 --> 00:26:32,270
hyperventilate for several hours your
kidneys would kick in

394
00:26:32,270 --> 00:26:36,400
and bring your blood pH back into

395
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:39,640
you normal range I am

396
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:42,880
but since the the Esperance stimulates
that

397
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:47,170
but it'll cause a respiratory alkalosis
that's when your blood becomes more

398
00:26:47,170 --> 00:26:48,330
basic because

399
00:26:48,330 --> 00:26:51,390
up your lungs mom and then

400
00:26:51,390 --> 00:26:54,800
he also did a metabolic as a doses
images

401
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:58,360
%uh for small your kidneys will
compensate

402
00:26:58,360 --> 00:27:01,390
some aspirin and its metabolites are
also

403
00:27:01,390 --> 00:27:05,600
their Siddique I am and also the
effective decoupling

404
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:09,710
are oxidative phosphorylation basically
going back to

405
00:27:09,710 --> 00:27:13,730
it to the cyanide in D hydroelectric
generator there

406
00:27:13,730 --> 00:27:17,700
on B match in that process instead of
blocking it

407
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:21,340
like cyanine does it detaches it's like
taking the

408
00:27:21,340 --> 00:27:24,770
the generator offline so well there's

409
00:27:24,770 --> 00:27:28,870
electron still they can flow but they're
not making any

410
00:27:28,870 --> 00:27:33,390
cellular energy com in that result in
more

411
00:27:33,390 --> 00:27:38,400
acid buildup and it causes your body
depth to use other methods to get energy

412
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:42,040
and metabolize glucose but

413
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:46,700
and the byproducts is that %uh lactic
acid pyruvic acid

414
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:50,410
up they also make things more so dick
well

415
00:27:50,410 --> 00:27:55,150
and also love your hyperventilating for
several hours in years leading air

416
00:27:55,150 --> 00:27:58,770
nobody your cells are metabolizing
faster

417
00:27:58,770 --> 00:28:02,050
but you lose a lot of water I'm

418
00:28:02,050 --> 00:28:06,120
and then your blood pressure goes down
there's less volume there

419
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:10,160
slit concentrates the acids in your
blood problem

420
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:14,010
and soul a aspirin overdose patient I'll
be

421
00:28:14,010 --> 00:28:17,720
their wouldn't like that alone will also
stimulate them to you

422
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:20,760
hyperventilate compensate for the essay
doses

423
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:25,200
insular their blood pH allegedly might
be in normal range

424
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:28,390
I'm but from lab values you can tell
that there's a mixed

425
00:28:28,390 --> 00:28:33,900
there's both it and eso doses crosses
and alkalosis process going on

426
00:28:33,900 --> 00:28:37,310
at the same time arm

427
00:28:37,310 --> 00:28:41,550
inserts a some more complicated overdose

428
00:28:41,550 --> 00:28:45,280
and in a problem is to like when you're
treating it

429
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:48,300
um if you were to I A

430
00:28:48,300 --> 00:28:52,470
you know give oxygen if you were to
intubate give someone a breathing tube

431
00:28:52,470 --> 00:28:56,360
I you set the respiratory rate and if
they're reading

432
00:28:56,360 --> 00:29:00,420
36 times a minute to compensate keep
their blood pH normal

433
00:29:00,420 --> 00:29:03,460
if you set the respiratory rate at
twenty

434
00:29:03,460 --> 00:29:07,290
they're gonna is in go downhill very
quickly

435
00:29:07,290 --> 00:29:10,530
because their blood scattered going to
acid doses

436
00:29:10,530 --> 00:29:14,000
and they're gonna die I am

437
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:18,250
and until early is after several hours
at this

438
00:29:18,250 --> 00:29:21,730
bill will wear out will wear out
themselves

439
00:29:21,730 --> 00:29:27,620
and they can again the one other things
with aspirin overdose is they can just

440
00:29:27,620 --> 00:29:28,410
quickly

441
00:29:28,410 --> 00:29:32,150
go downhill after being kind of stable
for a while

442
00:29:32,150 --> 00:29:36,370
I am so if the ESN doses

443
00:29:36,370 --> 00:29:39,900
isn't the thing is there's also the
other things they can kill you

444
00:29:39,900 --> 00:29:44,920
I'm there's hypoglycemia because your
cells are using up a whole lot o

445
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:49,530
glucose there's dehydration more fluid
loss I talked about

446
00:29:49,530 --> 00:29:53,940
there's electrolyte imbalances from all
the stuff that's going on

447
00:29:53,940 --> 00:29:57,810
and also hyperthermia could be a danger
so well

448
00:29:57,810 --> 00:30:02,640
so as printed has a lot of stuff going
on

449
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:07,090
at the same time I'm Size Me approached
carefully

450
00:30:07,090 --> 00:30:10,610
%uh there are treatments %uh sodium
bicarbonate

451
00:30:10,610 --> 00:30:14,140
which is the same as baking soda I'll
give it

452
00:30:14,140 --> 00:30:18,780
%uh as an i-beam a fluid give lots of
fluids at all

453
00:30:18,780 --> 00:30:22,110
%uh make the year in more alkaline

454
00:30:22,110 --> 00:30:26,510
arm more basic and so that helps the
acid

455
00:30:26,510 --> 00:30:33,510
the aspirin and its metabolites get
excreted

456
00:30:34,650 --> 00:30:40,150
I am and also diocesan severin in
toxicology or poison center will

457
00:30:40,150 --> 00:30:41,290
recommend

458
00:30:41,290 --> 00:30:44,720
in an aspirin overdose to to have the
team ready

459
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:49,750
like with the dialysis I begins again
someone go downhill really fast

460
00:30:49,750 --> 00:30:52,790
and and if you need to do dialysis

461
00:30:52,790 --> 00:30:56,710
your honor you wanna do it and have
everything ready to do it

462
00:30:56,710 --> 00:31:01,620
but sometimes aspirin still deadly even
with all the treatment

463
00:31:01,620 --> 00:31:05,350
I am and thats you ever wondered what
happens if you drink

464
00:31:05,350 --> 00:31:08,490
you eat the whole bottle love aspirin

465
00:31:08,490 --> 00:31:12,800
I am it's a start

466
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:16,560
