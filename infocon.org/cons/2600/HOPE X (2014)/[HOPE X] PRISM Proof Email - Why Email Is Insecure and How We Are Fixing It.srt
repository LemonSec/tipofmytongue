1
00:00:00,049 --> 00:00:03,949
thank you very much so

2
00:00:03,949 --> 00:00:07,160
I i'm for home baker I work for komodo

3
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:11,050
but this is not a an announcement to the
Komodo product

4
00:00:11,050 --> 00:00:14,090
all the views expressed are my own yada
yada yada

5
00:00:14,090 --> 00:00:17,650
they just prayed for this stuff I if you
want to have a

6
00:00:17,650 --> 00:00:22,510
the want to find out more information
present proof to all kinds links to all

7
00:00:22,510 --> 00:00:23,300
the specs

8
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:26,539
all the descriptions all the design
documents except for a

9
00:00:26,539 --> 00:00:30,550
now I started this work very shortly
after

10
00:00:30,550 --> 00:00:33,950
I Glenn Greenwald a husband was

11
00:00:33,950 --> 00:00:37,230
a harassed in Heathrow Airport I mean
like

12
00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:41,370
having been in the crib so world to
twenty years now

13
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:45,300
having had my car searched three times

14
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:50,039
on one trip to visit my parents shortly
after I started working on web security

15
00:00:50,039 --> 00:00:54,239
you know when you start attack I've
always known that I been under

16
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:57,420
surveillance but when you start
targeting family

17
00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:02,870
that was a step too far so I started
looking at ways of disrupting the prison

18
00:01:02,870 --> 00:01:03,620
program

19
00:01:03,620 --> 00:01:07,260
and then I bumped into Bruce Schneier
who was

20
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:12,619
the AXA have it at the time and had just
come back from Brazil

21
00:01:12,619 --> 00:01:17,409
having seen all the documents I
basically said well you know the NSA

22
00:01:17,409 --> 00:01:18,170
approach

23
00:01:18,170 --> 00:01:21,979
is if they have option a B&C

24
00:01:21,979 --> 00:01:25,630
their approaches all of the above

25
00:01:25,630 --> 00:01:28,790
so if you gonna do any good

26
00:01:28,790 --> 00:01:32,390
you can just look at one program

27
00:01:32,390 --> 00:01:36,049
you can just stop prism because

28
00:01:36,049 --> 00:01:39,460
the NSA has dozens of them

29
00:01:39,460 --> 00:01:42,640
now this hundreds is not just one
government either

30
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:48,329
any beer anybody recognize this woman
Anna Chapman

31
00:01:48,329 --> 00:01:51,350
she came to honor my seminars

32
00:01:51,350 --> 00:01:56,159
now she was local to Cambridge now I go
to

33
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:59,820
seminars MIT and Harvard you know she
came to them

34
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:03,229
I've had my data center knocked over by
the

35
00:02:03,229 --> 00:02:07,630
Iranian Revolutionary Guard you know
don't just what you know

36
00:02:07,630 --> 00:02:12,160
don't just focus on long government
gotta protect against the mall

37
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:17,160
I'm not just governments ever going to
get people security

38
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:20,840
possible to give them security gets
those internet criminals

39
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:23,959
I'm not just email

40
00:02:23,959 --> 00:02:27,280
either if you gonna do something that's
any good

41
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:32,010
it's got to be a platform that you can
build on so why start with the email

42
00:02:32,010 --> 00:02:36,900
well the answer is from a technical
point of view from a protocol design

43
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:37,670
pointed you

44
00:02:37,670 --> 00:02:41,180
email is the hardest protocol

45
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:44,239
to secure and the reason for that

46
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:47,720
is if you think about the way the email
message system works we sending a

47
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:48,410
message

48
00:02:48,410 --> 00:02:53,170
you send your message into the email
system and then you don't see

49
00:02:53,170 --> 00:02:57,390
anything else you'll never see that
message back you might see another

50
00:02:57,390 --> 00:03:00,530
email message sent back to you which the
bounce back

51
00:03:00,530 --> 00:03:03,930
but you cannot do any the things that we
can only do in TLS

52
00:03:03,930 --> 00:03:08,680
you can't have a conversation saying a
negotiation a security parameters

53
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:12,500
you can't get credentials from the
person that wants to post to

54
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:15,730
so the upshot is that if you can make

55
00:03:15,730 --> 00:03:20,870
email security really good and really
easy to use

56
00:03:20,870 --> 00:03:25,769
you can then take that mechanism I can
apply to VoIP you can apply to chat you

57
00:03:25,769 --> 00:03:26,870
can apply it to

58
00:03:26,870 --> 00:03:32,360
anything you want and the goal here

59
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:35,739
is to make Internet Security ubiquitous

60
00:03:35,739 --> 00:03:38,930
for all two billion uses the Internet

61
00:03:38,930 --> 00:03:42,360
because if we do any less than that

62
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:47,269
not gonna have prison proof email bills
prism is meta data right

63
00:03:47,269 --> 00:03:52,200
well what's the most important piece in
meta data that you use

64
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:56,970
the you giving out by using PGP is say

65
00:03:56,970 --> 00:04:03,390
hey I'm using encryption come look at me
and probably interesting so

66
00:04:03,390 --> 00:04:07,730
unless you're going to get everybody
using encryption you not doing anything

67
00:04:07,730 --> 00:04:11,689
so I'll be working this for this year
this is the

68
00:04:11,689 --> 00:04:15,849
launch and it's now called personal
privacy environment

69
00:04:15,849 --> 00:04:19,930
I wanted to give every user the Internet

70
00:04:19,930 --> 00:04:24,630
ubiquitous security which is a cause a
problem that's like making lightning

71
00:04:24,630 --> 00:04:25,810
strike

72
00:04:25,810 --> 00:04:28,880
you know we've been trying to do this
for twenty years

73
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:32,470
whites how we gonna do it different

74
00:04:32,470 --> 00:04:35,470
well the answer is

75
00:04:35,470 --> 00:04:39,850
let's copy from somebody who's already
done it

76
00:04:39,850 --> 00:04:43,370
I enemy recognize this guy Tim
berners-lee

77
00:04:43,370 --> 00:04:47,610
he's the father the web I met in
ninety-two

78
00:04:47,610 --> 00:04:50,639
our where he had a hundred people
working on the web

79
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:55,509
Ansar presentation that blew me away a
week later I ate

80
00:04:55,509 --> 00:04:59,300
got a fellowship to work surn working on
the wet

81
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:02,710
I and I became the security guy because

82
00:05:02,710 --> 00:05:07,660
I had a copy a bridge nyse: book

83
00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:11,240
I also had kinda form with

84
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:15,139
some scary agencies I am so how did bill

85
00:05:15,139 --> 00:05:18,430
110 make the WebWork well

86
00:05:18,430 --> 00:05:22,590
the web succeeded where the other
20-yard

87
00:05:22,590 --> 00:05:25,759
hypertext network high-tech systems
didn't

88
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:30,030
because it was designed for deployment
ice not calmly now but you know

89
00:05:30,030 --> 00:05:33,039
when we were at Sun we were thinking
about

90
00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:38,030
how could we make the web deploy I used
to run simulations

91
00:05:38,030 --> 00:05:43,600
to see we've got to technical approaches
which one deploys better

92
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:47,280
no it wasn't an accident that we won and
the other people lost

93
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:51,570
we build on open standards a su mountain
ACP

94
00:05:51,570 --> 00:05:55,229
were on the web were available to all
for free

95
00:05:55,229 --> 00:05:59,430
from the very start rebuilt on legacy

96
00:05:59,430 --> 00:06:03,300
I had this argument with him when tim
was saying what you got to use X 509

97
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:05,199
certificates

98
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:08,800
now Sekhon send mom I stacked

99
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:11,819
the no I'm not going to you a

100
00:06:11,819 --> 00:06:15,889
and he said well as horrible as a here
but you know

101
00:06:15,889 --> 00:06:19,330
June why do you think I used St and now
in the wet

102
00:06:19,330 --> 00:06:23,870
do you think I used SGML because I like
SGML

103
00:06:23,870 --> 00:06:27,280
tower thinking okay EA

104
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:31,789
probably don't like it anywhere the
reason that the web was built next year

105
00:06:31,789 --> 00:06:34,340
Mel was the because the publishing
industry

106
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:37,580
had already decided to move to

107
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:41,569
SGML as their in to change language

108
00:06:41,569 --> 00:06:46,020
and that's the reason they chose st. Mel
the well was not open architecture

109
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:49,669
so did Thai people into one publication
model

110
00:06:49,669 --> 00:06:53,880
yell other times were people like Adobe
who has had acrobats in your

111
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:57,509
bookings I had people like hyper GE

112
00:06:57,509 --> 00:07:01,490
they all had one idea of how you would
use hypertext

113
00:07:01,490 --> 00:07:05,780
what made the web different walls it
wasn't open architecture that allowed

114
00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:09,800
anybody to come along with that a great
idea and put it in

115
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:13,849
I make use of it and was public domain
reference code

116
00:07:13,849 --> 00:07:17,440
now knows I'm not saying open source
because open source was invented for

117
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:18,020
another

118
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:22,729
as a term for another five years at the
time the only free software model

119
00:07:22,729 --> 00:07:27,750
was populist and the thing about
copyleft was it was designed to

120
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:31,520
forced people to make the code free

121
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:34,910
and Tim said well I don't want that
because

122
00:07:34,910 --> 00:07:38,639
I want people to take my code

123
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:41,800
take the web and in bed it in for

124
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:45,940
profit applications we want to have the
wet

125
00:07:45,940 --> 00:07:49,099
embed it in Windows embedded in

126
00:07:49,099 --> 00:07:53,060
debt VMs embedded in salon Rs

127
00:07:53,060 --> 00:07:58,509
now the I get very angry when people say
Well microsoft stole the website

128
00:07:58,509 --> 00:08:02,300
Chino houses Sun I spent three months

129
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:06,310
begging Microsoft to use our system to
use

130
00:08:06,310 --> 00:08:10,419
our code I guess the word some good

131
00:08:10,419 --> 00:08:14,580
technical innovations in the wet in
particular

132
00:08:14,580 --> 00:08:18,789
you are ice your eyes the naming system

133
00:08:18,789 --> 00:08:23,530
was good but the biggest technical
decisions the most important ones were

134
00:08:23,530 --> 00:08:24,569
actually

135
00:08:24,569 --> 00:08:28,610
what's stuff we decided not to do

136
00:08:28,610 --> 00:08:31,639
all the things that it held back network
hypertext was

137
00:08:31,639 --> 00:08:35,029
a thing called referential transparency

138
00:08:35,029 --> 00:08:38,630
and the idea was that whenever there was
a hypertext link

139
00:08:38,630 --> 00:08:42,709
I clicked on it if go some way ago
somewhere that the

140
00:08:42,709 --> 00:08:45,920
author that document had intended

141
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:49,600
and Tim came along and said Well no

142
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:53,380
you click on the link it the stuff that
you dance wit otherwise

143
00:08:53,380 --> 00:08:59,339
yoga 404 not found and why is that such
an enormous

144
00:08:59,339 --> 00:09:02,540
technical advance well the reason is
that by

145
00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:05,839
avoiding this tech referential
transparency

146
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:10,990
problem it meant that links could just
be edited with the normal editor

147
00:09:10,990 --> 00:09:15,390
he didn't need database backed day web
sites to

148
00:09:15,390 --> 00:09:20,820
serve just ordinary web pages he cut-out
a huge number of problems with network

149
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:21,980
hypertext

150
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:27,440
by deciding that something that the
whole field to decide was essential

151
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:30,750
was actually kinda if people want its do
it

152
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:35,950
taking with index the web did not have a
built-in search mechanism

153
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:40,170
but pretty soon a gun buncha focal i
cost built one

154
00:09:40,170 --> 00:09:45,330
and then some folk called Google came
along and did it better

155
00:09:45,330 --> 00:09:48,959
and that's the template the time copying
here

156
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:52,800
pp is all bills on open standards or
proposed standards

157
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:57,680
all the documents that I write I may be
circulating in private for a week

158
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:00,740
just to make sure I don't put out to
document the makes me look like a rave

159
00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:02,920
idiot

160
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:06,620
security is one others feel that you put
something out there in your

161
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:10,910
everybody comes and kills your baby

162
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:16,130
I they watch the yes yes I do thank you
for it but you know

163
00:10:16,130 --> 00:10:19,220
I don't thank you for the miles a
sarcasm you give

164
00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:24,269
I mean you know I have a very fragile
ego you know

165
00:10:24,269 --> 00:10:27,930
the am this design stuffs other than
anything

166
00:10:27,930 --> 00:10:31,589
looks so is all out there

167
00:10:31,589 --> 00:10:35,550
and wherever possible I'm building a
legacy and in particular here

168
00:10:35,550 --> 00:10:38,670
building on s mine and the reason for
that

169
00:10:38,670 --> 00:10:43,339
is there are five billion email clients
out there

170
00:10:43,339 --> 00:10:46,420
that can receive s mine email

171
00:10:46,420 --> 00:10:51,010
so I'm gonna build on that because I can
send email to those clients and I'll

172
00:10:51,010 --> 00:10:51,890
read them now

173
00:10:51,890 --> 00:10:55,839
without any plugins I'm perfectly happy
to

174
00:10:55,839 --> 00:10:59,459
also at PDP I've talked to phil
zimmerman

175
00:10:59,459 --> 00:11:02,740
I know how to do it a

176
00:11:02,740 --> 00:11:08,079
I just don't have time to do every last
bit

177
00:11:08,079 --> 00:11:12,290
an open source code of course all my
code oh my reference code

178
00:11:12,290 --> 00:11:16,350
is on SourceForge you can download it
the league's their own prison trip to

179
00:11:16,350 --> 00:11:17,089
all

180
00:11:17,089 --> 00:11:21,339
all the generators I used to synthesize
the curtain specifications are up there

181
00:11:21,339 --> 00:11:25,980
everything and yes I have made some
technical choices

182
00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:29,200
I've got strong email addresses which
I'll come to in a moment

183
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:33,760
i punted on the hard stuff there are
some really hard problems as I decided

184
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:36,200
not to do in phase 1

185
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:41,610
because those are problems that can be
solved better as a layer on top a PP

186
00:11:41,610 --> 00:11:45,839
rather than building it into things on
stage while

187
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:49,480
so what we doing here is dividing up the
problem

188
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:54,120
those two parts to PP won't pass is
common infrastructure that

189
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:57,380
anybody who's developing a new messaging
scheme

190
00:11:57,380 --> 00:12:01,380
could in principle such set you mail
system integration

191
00:12:01,380 --> 00:12:05,180
if we're gonna have a new mailing
christians Kenya gonna have to extend

192
00:12:05,180 --> 00:12:09,040
outlook Windows Live Mail Thunderbird
and so on

193
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:12,240
well that's all the work that we can
share

194
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:15,800
you have to have an infrastructure the
distribution of keys

195
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:19,730
well know but serves is pretty much a
look the same I mean like

196
00:12:19,730 --> 00:12:24,350
that's another piece that we can chat so
let's bill some stuff here that we can

197
00:12:24,350 --> 00:12:26,089
all share is infrastructure

198
00:12:26,089 --> 00:12:29,130
to enable internet users

199
00:12:29,130 --> 00:12:32,839
and then this other piece that we really
like doing you know the interesting

200
00:12:32,839 --> 00:12:33,990
stuff to me

201
00:12:33,990 --> 00:12:37,329
like trust models and transport

202
00:12:37,329 --> 00:12:41,790
that is protected against traffic
analysis

203
00:12:41,790 --> 00:12:46,420
that's areas where you know let five
different people go off and do five

204
00:12:46,420 --> 00:12:48,430
different things because you know

205
00:12:48,430 --> 00:12:52,550
nervous no absolutely which is one's
gonna be best

206
00:12:52,550 --> 00:12:56,110
so the way the I divide it up is desert
yup

207
00:12:56,110 --> 00:13:02,940
this is the part that I want to be doing
that's my dessert that is because I want

208
00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:07,000
but to make the stuff useful you now

209
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:10,970
you got to eat at your meat and two veg

210
00:13:10,970 --> 00:13:16,250
and so you know I spent a year eating
meat and two veg

211
00:13:16,250 --> 00:13:19,310
and yes yo least steal stuff yup

212
00:13:19,310 --> 00:13:23,120
this is not about do it my way

213
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:26,910
please take this stuff to make you sad
Anya the objective here is to get

214
00:13:26,910 --> 00:13:27,950
Microsoft

215
00:13:27,950 --> 00:13:31,630
and Google Apple and all those providers

216
00:13:31,630 --> 00:13:34,769
up mail applications to take this stuff
and

217
00:13:34,769 --> 00:13:38,880
embed it in the stuff that provide to
actual consumers

218
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:42,260
and the reason I'm here is to recruit

219
00:13:42,260 --> 00:13:46,820
because yell I'm one person I can only
write code is a pretty cool

220
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:50,720
speed if we're gonna make this happen

221
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:54,800
we need a lot of people involved you
know we need people to use it and see

222
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:56,380
whether it actually works

223
00:13:56,380 --> 00:14:01,089
we need people to test it many people to
write code and not just ripped occurred

224
00:14:01,089 --> 00:14:04,839
if the people crypto codes as get great
in a

225
00:14:04,839 --> 00:14:07,959
there's a lot if you like oh that's also
with me yup or

226
00:14:07,959 --> 00:14:11,690
everyman if we gonna make this happen we
have to modify

227
00:14:11,690 --> 00:14:15,940
every internet mail client eventually
says he's built in

228
00:14:15,940 --> 00:14:20,350
and people can just make you serve it
without thinking

229
00:14:20,350 --> 00:14:24,610
and %um maybe most importantly Bowl
evangelist people go to the likes of

230
00:14:24,610 --> 00:14:26,250
Microsoft and Sun so on

231
00:14:26,250 --> 00:14:29,440
a sec K this is the stuff we're using it
please

232
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:33,300
please support it okay

233
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:36,470
silo we've got

234
00:14:36,470 --> 00:14:40,459
one thing to do is to convince people
that this is possible

235
00:14:40,459 --> 00:14:44,029
and Egypt won the elections was made was
well you know when you starting

236
00:14:44,029 --> 00:14:51,029
the web network hypertext was actually
thirty years old

237
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:55,720
you know Ted Nelson came out was an ADO
1960

238
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:59,149
so tim was clio well

239
00:14:59,149 --> 00:15:03,630
doug farah here's the really strange
thing

240
00:15:03,630 --> 00:15:07,199
we already have email encryption a few

241
00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:10,399
if you have an iPhone the pocket if you
use

242
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:13,959
any of the common desktop email clients

243
00:15:13,959 --> 00:15:18,209
you've had email encryption built in for
15 years

244
00:15:18,209 --> 00:15:23,320
but almost nobody uses how many people
here have used to encrypt it mail in the

245
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:26,019
past week

246
00:15:26,019 --> 00:15:29,699
okay how many people here

247
00:15:29,699 --> 00:15:35,250
use encrypt it male every single day

248
00:15:35,250 --> 00:15:38,329
yeah I mean like some folk

249
00:15:38,329 --> 00:15:41,740
this is this is the audience where you
know

250
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:46,190
surely every hand should be going up if
we done the job right

251
00:15:46,190 --> 00:15:49,759
so what hasn't happened we know what
went wrong well

252
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:54,579
they're a bunch of historical thanks yo
back in 1992 when I started working on

253
00:15:54,579 --> 00:15:56,040
the web you know and there was doing

254
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:59,839
a.m. the password authentication PCM

255
00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:03,360
the client of peace in a speech is the
way it is because

256
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:07,550
arce was patented all public he was
present itself I couldn't use techniques

257
00:16:07,550 --> 00:16:10,160
that I really wanted to use

258
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:14,149
patents no longer a problem you know
we've had public key cryptography out a

259
00:16:14,149 --> 00:16:16,550
patent for fifteen years now

260
00:16:16,550 --> 00:16:19,990
limited machine capabilities if you look
at the design are s/mime

261
00:16:19,990 --> 00:16:23,800
and PGP that both designed as a time
when

262
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:28,100
doing a public key crypto operation
talks time

263
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:32,240
you would wait a significant like the
time did you just one of them

264
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:35,440
so doing a fancy PK I the

265
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:39,139
where chain of trust you know that
really wasn't gonna happen

266
00:16:39,139 --> 00:16:44,850
today you can do arce you can do pretty
much any the public key operations

267
00:16:44,850 --> 00:16:49,410
on the client side just happens and know
he's noticing

268
00:16:49,410 --> 00:16:53,560
the other two pieces I mean like a year
ago

269
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:57,029
have risen the trip to walls of the
United said you know there are over

270
00:16:57,029 --> 00:17:00,889
you know we don't get harassed by the
NSA anymore but

271
00:17:00,889 --> 00:17:05,049
to okay well have

272
00:17:05,049 --> 00:17:08,780
but we love them still with us and
that's the standards were balls

273
00:17:08,780 --> 00:17:13,189
and you know this is this I'll get
directions

274
00:17:13,189 --> 00:17:17,150
so what's going on here well with in any
of these email encryption schemes

275
00:17:17,150 --> 00:17:20,709
would basically using the public key
infrastructure approach

276
00:17:20,709 --> 00:17:25,410
we use digital signatures to
authenticate people's keys

277
00:17:25,410 --> 00:17:29,220
we then use public key encryption to
exchange symmetric keys on the user's

278
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:33,500
metric keys to encrypt the actual data
were interested in

279
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:37,620
and this approach has been applied
numerous times to email starting in

280
00:17:37,620 --> 00:17:42,820
1993 anybody ever use here anybody ever
use Pam

281
00:17:42,820 --> 00:17:46,410
name me I

282
00:17:46,410 --> 00:17:49,750
okay they had this model in the head
this hierarchy of certificate

283
00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:51,490
authorities never happened where

284
00:17:51,490 --> 00:17:54,929
you have this route to root certificate
authority that would do

285
00:17:54,929 --> 00:17:58,140
would issue certificates to sub CA's

286
00:17:58,140 --> 00:18:02,450
they would be subsea A's underneath them
and turtles all the way down to me

287
00:18:02,450 --> 00:18:06,910
the I can't quite remember the from
nomenclature but

288
00:18:06,910 --> 00:18:10,710
this is the one that I've got your kings
and are you probably can't see at the

289
00:18:10,710 --> 00:18:12,260
bottom here we've got serbs

290
00:18:12,260 --> 00:18:17,640
peasants and dirty smelly hippies

291
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:20,799
so not surprisingly perhaps your hey
he's one of those

292
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:24,799
products that is best-known pool the

293
00:18:24,799 --> 00:18:28,250
responses that it lead to

294
00:18:28,250 --> 00:18:32,350
most important these be pgp now fills in
a look

295
00:18:32,350 --> 00:18:36,830
took a look at the pamela's I hey that's
never gonna happen

296
00:18:36,830 --> 00:18:41,380
and if it does I want it to happen and
the thing about PDP web trusses

297
00:18:41,380 --> 00:18:46,250
everybody is a PIA at about the same
time

298
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:50,510
arce was reworking s p Hammond those
ideas

299
00:18:50,510 --> 00:18:54,100
it to trade s mine which was integrated
with the new I T A

300
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:58,169
mail system mine and they had a
brainwave a

301
00:18:58,169 --> 00:19:01,970
hello you don't have to have one router
roots at the top

302
00:19:01,970 --> 00:19:05,160
the compy multiple CA us

303
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:09,380
as so you know there was a division of
opinion

304
00:19:09,380 --> 00:19:14,110
now PCP however

305
00:19:14,110 --> 00:19:17,580
had a better marketing department and it
was this guy didn't even want to be

306
00:19:17,580 --> 00:19:19,000
marked in PDP

307
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:23,010
this is Louis free probably most useless
director of the FBI

308
00:19:23,010 --> 00:19:27,210
ever I can say that because

309
00:19:27,210 --> 00:19:31,750
not only did he spend his time railing
against these a strong cryptography

310
00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:36,230
when the inquisition xque you know when
the inquiry's came into 911

311
00:19:36,230 --> 00:19:40,960
it became apparent that the reason the
team never understood why

312
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:44,620
the hacker community by the trip to
community was so worried about what he

313
00:19:44,620 --> 00:19:46,120
was saying

314
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:50,190
just because he just didn't understand
what computers could do

315
00:19:50,190 --> 00:19:54,760
the FBI was using up but shove rubbish
computers that have been less developed

316
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:55,210
in

317
00:19:55,210 --> 00:19:59,160
you know in the nineteen sixties they
had a search system that allowed them to

318
00:19:59,160 --> 00:19:59,730
use search

319
00:19:59,730 --> 00:20:03,230
Wong term at a time

320
00:20:03,230 --> 00:20:07,620
so the reason that they didn't see the
privacy risks that we all saw

321
00:20:07,620 --> 00:20:11,630
was because they were operating in the
nineteen sixties and we're taking

322
00:20:11,630 --> 00:20:13,090
advantage in value this

323
00:20:13,090 --> 00:20:16,370
technology

324
00:20:16,370 --> 00:20:22,710
but long-term consequence is we've had a
15-year standard still stalemate

325
00:20:22,710 --> 00:20:26,770
I we've got a situation where yes like
the VHS Peter Max thing

326
00:20:26,770 --> 00:20:30,630
only this time he said being one by one
side

327
00:20:30,630 --> 00:20:34,600
both sides have had a victory of sorts

328
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:38,140
s/mime is deployed in five billion

329
00:20:38,140 --> 00:20:41,760
email clients if you download outlook a
few

330
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:45,580
Windows Live Mail Thunderbird whatever
effect

331
00:20:45,580 --> 00:20:49,320
apart from Android the mail client
everything

332
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:53,340
comes with s/mime already built in

333
00:20:53,340 --> 00:20:56,470
but the product that has the man

334
00:20:56,470 --> 00:20:59,840
mind share is pgp

335
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:03,530
and this has been going on now for
fifteen years

336
00:21:03,530 --> 00:21:07,210
neither has one I don't think not I the
can win because

337
00:21:07,210 --> 00:21:11,500
s mine has this problem is too hot to
get the certificates

338
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:14,980
and then what you've got the certificate
see me install them while they expire in

339
00:21:14,980 --> 00:21:17,110
a year

340
00:21:17,110 --> 00:21:21,710
I gotta do it all over again I just too
much hassle to use your

341
00:21:21,710 --> 00:21:25,490
you have to click this button to say
encrypt this message

342
00:21:25,490 --> 00:21:31,340
and yup laughing but you talk to the
Apple guys

343
00:21:31,340 --> 00:21:34,799
clicking Wong Busan to say I want this
encrypt it

344
00:21:34,799 --> 00:21:39,480
that is too much for Apple usability
fuck

345
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:43,850
and you know what there right

346
00:21:43,850 --> 00:21:47,320
if we want everybody to use encrypt it
male

347
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:50,690
all the time and cryptid male must be

348
00:21:50,690 --> 00:21:54,690
as easy to use as regular mail

349
00:21:54,690 --> 00:22:01,690
absolutely no additional act

350
00:22:02,669 --> 00:22:06,669
pgp well

351
00:22:06,669 --> 00:22:09,799
officials from that nobody can
understand unless the kinda like it

352
00:22:09,799 --> 00:22:14,299
T but danny's just too much hassle to
use

353
00:22:14,299 --> 00:22:17,490
I had both had them but I get very
little

354
00:22:17,490 --> 00:22:20,809
a cryptid mail

355
00:22:20,809 --> 00:22:25,350
just too much hassle so here's the
solution

356
00:22:25,350 --> 00:22:29,789
yup if PHS purses Peter Max had gone on
until the nineties

357
00:22:29,789 --> 00:22:34,789
this is what would have happened DVD
would have come out and replaced but

358
00:22:34,789 --> 00:22:39,289
I'm only got me thinking of is not which
is going to work but

359
00:22:39,289 --> 00:22:43,150
what email infrastructure do we want

360
00:22:43,150 --> 00:22:46,510
what's the next generation that's going
to rip replaced both

361
00:22:46,510 --> 00:22:49,830
them and make email actually usable

362
00:22:49,830 --> 00:22:53,190
and to do that we've got to achieve what
I call

363
00:22:53,190 --> 00:22:56,570
friction the security it's got to
require

364
00:22:56,570 --> 00:23:00,460
absolutely no additional effort to you
secure mail

365
00:23:00,460 --> 00:23:04,070
no additional configuration effort no
conditional

366
00:23:04,070 --> 00:23:07,289
steps when the is in use and no
maintenance

367
00:23:07,289 --> 00:23:11,900
no manuals the only time you can ever
trade on the user and have them do

368
00:23:11,900 --> 00:23:12,750
something is

369
00:23:12,750 --> 00:23:17,440
when not use it decides I'm sending this
letter to a very important person

370
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:20,970
maybe I'm sending a letter to my lawyer

371
00:23:20,970 --> 00:23:26,080
maybe it's the bank to send any my
statement and they want to make sure

372
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:29,130
the city centre interested or not at all

373
00:23:29,130 --> 00:23:34,230
that's the only time which will allow
the user to be interrupted

374
00:23:34,230 --> 00:23:37,770
and that's what we're doing now with pp
not .1

375
00:23:37,770 --> 00:23:41,830
at the moment I've only got deep
integration for Windows Live Mail

376
00:23:41,830 --> 00:23:45,480
you can use the code with an email
client if your choice

377
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:49,970
but he's only frictionless the
configuration if using that one product

378
00:23:49,970 --> 00:23:51,850
and the reason for that is

379
00:23:51,850 --> 00:23:55,330
I can only type so fast

380
00:23:55,330 --> 00:23:58,750
so if using the up the reference code

381
00:23:58,750 --> 00:24:02,740
to configure your client to the scene
encrypt email

382
00:24:02,740 --> 00:24:07,390
all you do is run key manager and that
will generate your personal

383
00:24:07,390 --> 00:24:12,230
pecan high rocky outcome to a second
generate a strong email address

384
00:24:12,230 --> 00:24:15,600
the finger and recovery cuz everything
you need to have

385
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:19,850
your own personal pique I it will then
configure

386
00:24:19,850 --> 00:24:23,529
your mail client to use the certificates
is generated

387
00:24:23,529 --> 00:24:27,010
it will push there's one thing at the
moment the city to the hack

388
00:24:27,010 --> 00:24:30,010
which is you've got I got this day to
the other people need to

389
00:24:30,010 --> 00:24:33,409
connect access to be able to talk to you

390
00:24:33,409 --> 00:24:36,720
and there has to be published on the web
server some somewhere doesn't matter

391
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:38,320
which web services

392
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:42,070
does need to be a trusted web server but
it needs to be published somewhere

393
00:24:42,070 --> 00:24:46,929
using the well-known protocol and at the
moment I don't have the automated

394
00:24:46,929 --> 00:24:50,000
this is obviously something that could
be automated in 10 minutes with the

395
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:50,350
Pearl

396
00:24:50,350 --> 00:24:54,890
back I've not had time to do that

397
00:24:54,890 --> 00:24:58,830
and now anybody in the world consent to
encrypt it male and become

398
00:24:58,830 --> 00:25:03,070
convinced that they're sending you the
mailing cryptid or not at all

399
00:25:03,070 --> 00:25:08,510
and it will work with 95 percent to the
email clients out there

400
00:25:08,510 --> 00:25:11,650
no effort required on the user toll

401
00:25:11,650 --> 00:25:16,049
to receive the encrypted mail and that's
because we're leveraging the s/mime lead

402
00:25:16,049 --> 00:25:17,779
that's already built into the client's

403
00:25:17,779 --> 00:25:23,860
no need to put in a plug in

404
00:25:23,860 --> 00:25:27,510
again yup if there's anybody out there
who knows these other

405
00:25:27,510 --> 00:25:30,640
products I me yet

406
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:33,860
is not that long to do each one but up

407
00:25:33,860 --> 00:25:38,320
taking the time to learn which each one
does you know

408
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:41,360
so personal PTI what's that the idea
here is

409
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:44,400
less correct one the biggest mistakes
that was made

410
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:48,650
in the PAM high rocky help the pen
hierarchy did have

411
00:25:48,650 --> 00:25:53,150
a good idea which was a route to trust
but they had the wrong person at the

412
00:25:53,150 --> 00:25:53,960
root

413
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:58,110
you know they had the you know some
faceless government bureaucracy or

414
00:25:58,110 --> 00:25:59,440
whatever

415
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:03,570
there's only one person who should be in
charge have your personal route trust

416
00:26:03,570 --> 00:26:06,440
and that is

417
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:10,340
you so you gonna have a personal pique
and i

418
00:26:10,340 --> 00:26:15,110
I'm here I'm using the same approach
that we use when we rolled out the

419
00:26:15,110 --> 00:26:16,400
VeriSign PK I

420
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:20,070
I back in the 95 ok I was person

421
00:26:20,070 --> 00:26:23,480
to as principal scientist after a dozen
years

422
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:27,840
%uh so this is exactly what we did that
we have in the VeriSign P can I those

423
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:32,419
a no fly master that never see never
touches the Internet

424
00:26:32,419 --> 00:26:37,210
and that uses sign online key and then
the on like he's used sign

425
00:26:37,210 --> 00:26:40,480
use keys and the use keys I what it

426
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:44,179
the user actually gonna be using for
encryption

427
00:26:44,179 --> 00:26:47,510
and device and authentication

428
00:26:47,510 --> 00:26:52,250
now you're in traction key you probably
gonna want to be able to receive your

429
00:26:52,250 --> 00:26:53,169
email

430
00:26:53,169 --> 00:26:57,840
on wall more than one device II was
counting at the number of devices I

431
00:26:57,840 --> 00:26:59,090
receive email on

432
00:26:59,090 --> 00:27:02,159
and it's actually six

433
00:27:02,159 --> 00:27:06,049
now cuz I well three desktops two
tablets

434
00:27:06,049 --> 00:27:12,000
to 0 7

435
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:16,500
you know they multiply and if using
encrypted males going to be as

436
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:20,659
easy as using regular mail you gonna
have to be able to read

437
00:27:20,659 --> 00:27:24,840
an encrypted message that somebody is
sent you on any of those machines

438
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:28,429
which means that your encryption key or
other your depiction key

439
00:27:28,429 --> 00:27:33,370
has to be magically installed in
everyone on the machine to use

440
00:27:33,370 --> 00:27:37,090
also as soon as you put a an encryption
key

441
00:27:37,090 --> 00:27:41,230
on something like an iPhone or a tablet
anything that's mobile

442
00:27:41,230 --> 00:27:44,260
anything that can get lost

443
00:27:44,260 --> 00:27:47,029
you probably gonna have want to have
some way of having some control over

444
00:27:47,029 --> 00:27:48,090
that key

445
00:27:48,090 --> 00:27:52,070
and the best way to have control over
encryption key is to limit the length of

446
00:27:52,070 --> 00:27:56,559
time that you let people use it to send
you inflicted mail

447
00:27:56,559 --> 00:28:00,490
say probably want to be cycling your
injection keys maybe

448
00:28:00,490 --> 00:28:04,750
once a month but you won't have it all
happening automatically

449
00:28:04,750 --> 00:28:08,330
this is not something the user should
have a/c while the Prince

450
00:28:08,330 --> 00:28:11,510
won the guiding principles of all this
is this is

451
00:28:11,510 --> 00:28:15,039
absolutely platinum plated very stated
dr.

452
00:28:15,039 --> 00:28:18,399
top level topography that we would give
to you know

453
00:28:18,399 --> 00:28:22,220
the best customers are giving it to
everybody

454
00:28:22,220 --> 00:28:25,440
so there's no compromise in security I
don't believe

455
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:29,440
that there's a difference between
sophisticated users

456
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:32,740
and ordinary users because you know what

457
00:28:32,740 --> 00:28:36,010
all this stuff here is that because

458
00:28:36,010 --> 00:28:39,669
people make mistakes the reason you have
an offline and online key

459
00:28:39,669 --> 00:28:44,190
it because machines get compromised are
you really don't want your master key to

460
00:28:44,190 --> 00:28:44,640
be

461
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:50,659
compromised I the reason that he split
encryption authentication keys is

462
00:28:50,659 --> 00:28:51,270
because

463
00:28:51,270 --> 00:28:54,640
devices get lost

464
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:57,970
and so you know are ordinary users

465
00:28:57,970 --> 00:29:01,039
more or less likely to be using that
he's then

466
00:29:01,039 --> 00:29:04,100
sophisticated ones

467
00:29:04,100 --> 00:29:07,860
so strong email addresses what's that

468
00:29:07,860 --> 00:29:11,460
okay you have your personal master key

469
00:29:11,460 --> 00:29:16,279
we take a fingerprint have that it's not
quite a PGP fingerprint

470
00:29:16,279 --> 00:29:20,010
no now but Bay 64 they 64 allows us to
use

471
00:29:20,010 --> 00:29:24,029
mall bits and the same active data take
that

472
00:29:24,029 --> 00:29:27,470
I we simply prepaid and it onto

473
00:29:27,470 --> 00:29:32,210
an email address with a question mark in
between reason the question mark is

474
00:29:32,210 --> 00:29:35,559
chosen is because question mark turns
out to be a legal

475
00:29:35,559 --> 00:29:38,990
email address character however it isn't

476
00:29:38,990 --> 00:29:44,830
illegal account character on every
operating system

477
00:29:44,830 --> 00:29:50,299
yeah you guys in this room at the reason

478
00:29:50,299 --> 00:29:54,770
so the former here is fingerprint
question of account at the main

479
00:29:54,770 --> 00:29:58,419
actually the main is not necessary to
maintain the mail server

480
00:29:58,419 --> 00:30:02,720
a few to publish a fingerprint on the
mail server that using great

481
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:07,520
otherwise you might have to publish your
fingerprint somewhere else and

482
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:12,539
people have have people download so here
we have the fingerprint which in this

483
00:30:12,539 --> 00:30:13,640
case is the fingerprint

484
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:16,830
alice is personal pique I had hierarchy
this is

485
00:30:16,830 --> 00:30:23,010
a fingerprint the hopefully Alice does
not need to be forced to change

486
00:30:23,010 --> 00:30:26,390
ever so that she can do things like

487
00:30:26,390 --> 00:30:29,399
have a QR code encoded on that

488
00:30:29,399 --> 00:30:34,130
on her iPhone I so that you know when
she wanted to give it somebody else you

489
00:30:34,130 --> 00:30:34,690
can just

490
00:30:34,690 --> 00:30:39,510
without the iPhone and hand over the
fingerprint

491
00:30:39,510 --> 00:30:43,750
account bout you need to know what's in
the melting

492
00:30:43,750 --> 00:30:48,659
the the fingerprint is used to retrieve
the finger

493
00:30:48,659 --> 00:30:51,909
and the finger is the bit just adjacent
data

494
00:30:51,909 --> 00:30:55,870
structure that contains all the
certificate chain all the information

495
00:30:55,870 --> 00:30:57,340
that a client needs to

496
00:30:57,340 --> 00:31:00,399
validate are you ski and

497
00:31:00,399 --> 00:31:05,010
decide how to send encryption I this is
the point at which you know

498
00:31:05,010 --> 00:31:09,140
at the moment I've got a code that press
mime if you really easy

499
00:31:09,140 --> 00:31:14,070
to code it so that you could support pgp
as well

500
00:31:14,070 --> 00:31:17,590
I has policy statements which is saying
things like okay

501
00:31:17,590 --> 00:31:22,289
if you want some email than you want to
send SMTP to this file

502
00:31:22,289 --> 00:31:26,190
this server and it's got star TLS on it

503
00:31:26,190 --> 00:31:29,669
a in using and when security but there's
no need to

504
00:31:29,669 --> 00:31:33,570
forget about transport security as well
own has a fingerprint have the key

505
00:31:33,570 --> 00:31:37,960
for the TLS at s mine is preferred

506
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:41,090
and his difficult at

507
00:31:41,090 --> 00:31:45,169
is the key and if you're in VIP

508
00:31:45,169 --> 00:31:49,010
well they've been pre-approved then
here's another certificate you might be

509
00:31:49,010 --> 00:31:51,679
using

510
00:31:51,679 --> 00:31:55,080
are one of the things he starts to
realize when me

511
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:59,330
designed to stuff is okay if I'm gonna
turn on Inc email encryption

512
00:31:59,330 --> 00:32:03,110
and everybody in the world suddenly
start sending me interested mail

513
00:32:03,110 --> 00:32:06,640
that might not be an unmitigated success

514
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:10,240
until I've got everyone in my devices
enabled

515
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:13,659
so that I can receiving pritchard mail

516
00:32:13,659 --> 00:32:17,480
so while the policy pieces here last
summer say hey yes

517
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:21,320
I have setup every device on which I
read email

518
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:27,210
now encrypted emails for so that's the
current say to the key manager

519
00:32:27,210 --> 00:32:31,059
I in the next release we're hoping now

520
00:32:31,059 --> 00:32:34,590
making the publications the web sites
will become automatic

521
00:32:34,590 --> 00:32:39,370
it will also have an option I I i
emphasize that this will be

522
00:32:39,370 --> 00:32:43,799
I'm option to enroll your certificate in
a key server infrastructure

523
00:32:43,799 --> 00:32:47,090
I minor things my employees been doing
now

524
00:32:47,090 --> 00:32:51,260
is giving way free s mindsets so you
know there's a

525
00:32:51,260 --> 00:32:57,159
certificates over there and they gave me
the protocol for has talked to its on a

526
00:32:57,159 --> 00:32:59,419
bill that into the key manager

527
00:32:59,419 --> 00:33:03,070
a I also want to stop making use of
Google certificates

528
00:33:03,070 --> 00:33:06,370
transparency is a and with me with that
project

529
00:33:06,370 --> 00:33:09,820
I've not got time to Tracy it now but
it's

530
00:33:09,820 --> 00:33:15,590
really amazing stuff Ben Marin Co are
really doing great technology that

531
00:33:15,590 --> 00:33:20,269
I want to embed here I it also can be
used to register your

532
00:33:20,269 --> 00:33:24,850
secret keys I so the idea here's your on
the key manager

533
00:33:24,850 --> 00:33:29,080
and it will encrypt the and trips in key
the price the site and click the

534
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:29,980
detection key

535
00:33:29,980 --> 00:33:33,460
and uploaded to the server now why would
you want to do that

536
00:33:33,460 --> 00:33:36,500
well then weaken

537
00:33:36,500 --> 00:33:40,120
transport that key into all the other
devices

538
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:43,779
using and because it was stored encrypt
it because

539
00:33:43,779 --> 00:33:47,529
we chose a random number for the the
crypt in key

540
00:33:47,529 --> 00:33:50,890
and not a passphrase we can do it
securely

541
00:33:50,890 --> 00:33:55,279
this is obviously can support the
telling people that email

542
00:33:55,279 --> 00:33:59,419
pretty masks professed okay so that's
receiving a male

543
00:33:59,419 --> 00:34:02,950
well what you want to do when you send
email and here's the point where

544
00:34:02,950 --> 00:34:06,740
okay you can still run your existing
mail client

545
00:34:06,740 --> 00:34:10,089
I you don't need to put a plug in

546
00:34:10,089 --> 00:34:13,700
that changes the code to the webclient
itself

547
00:34:13,700 --> 00:34:17,099
but I do need a hope that I can change
the bits

548
00:34:17,099 --> 00:34:20,730
on yo y and what the Hokies

549
00:34:20,730 --> 00:34:24,649
is a proxy is an outbound SMT mail proxy

550
00:34:24,649 --> 00:34:28,859
and it basically takes all the mail from
them

551
00:34:28,859 --> 00:34:32,560
the mail client is configured to pipe
all the outputs

552
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:36,260
all the outbound mail through this males
this proxy

553
00:34:36,260 --> 00:34:40,970
an MP sits there and decides 0 kind trip
that message

554
00:34:40,970 --> 00:34:44,649
if cell Allen tripped before send some

555
00:34:44,649 --> 00:34:48,740
now this is a trusted proxy I'll which
is

556
00:34:48,740 --> 00:34:52,210
obviously not an end to end solution
unless

557
00:34:52,210 --> 00:34:55,849
you have to be running P on the same
machine

558
00:34:55,849 --> 00:34:59,630
that your email client is running up
ideally I would hope people would run

559
00:34:59,630 --> 00:35:00,109
this

560
00:35:00,109 --> 00:35:04,710
on the same machine I have got TLS
turned on

561
00:35:04,710 --> 00:35:08,420
just in case people down bir

562
00:35:08,420 --> 00:35:12,250
so the current version is just looking
for strong email addresses

563
00:35:12,250 --> 00:35:16,240
and whenever it sees a strong email
address it will then

564
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:21,010
encrypt the data wealthy realizes it
must be sent in printed

565
00:35:21,010 --> 00:35:24,099
retries the finger from the web and

566
00:35:24,099 --> 00:35:28,980
and cryptid the message as directed the
mountains are you doing as mine but

567
00:35:28,980 --> 00:35:32,130
be easy to add PDP those PDP led

568
00:35:32,130 --> 00:35:35,859
Haxton and why want to do for one point
not

569
00:35:35,859 --> 00:35:39,040
is to check every outbound address

570
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:42,410
creas service in the cloud and say hate

571
00:35:42,410 --> 00:35:46,960
I'm sending this message to this user do
you have a key

572
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:51,210
that allows me to send this message in
cryptid and this is of course where

573
00:35:51,210 --> 00:35:54,369
you're introducing possibility of third
parties

574
00:35:54,369 --> 00:35:57,820
and obviously that service is going to
be a trusted Wall

575
00:35:57,820 --> 00:36:00,820
it might be a trusted service that you

576
00:36:00,820 --> 00:36:04,640
install and Ron for you yourself

577
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:08,950
it might be a trusted service those
provided by the likes this man tech or

578
00:36:08,950 --> 00:36:10,000
komodo

579
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:13,320
or whoever who happened to be in the
antivirus protection

580
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:16,400
business

581
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:20,420
so in the Pete one point not we will
then have achieved

582
00:36:20,420 --> 00:36:24,490
the testbed on which people can start to
explore

583
00:36:24,490 --> 00:36:29,040
new trust models and you message
transports

584
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:33,680
when the key mangia runs it will push
the key to a key broke up

585
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:37,910
by this on the published protocol when
the mail sender

586
00:36:37,910 --> 00:36:42,730
is I the people hopefully someday will
start to get

587
00:36:42,730 --> 00:36:45,869
male clients that have that
functionality built in way

588
00:36:45,869 --> 00:36:50,000
struck trying to send a message it will
send a query over the essay

589
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:53,020
do you have keys maybe don't way since

590
00:36:53,020 --> 00:36:56,630
if you've got deep integration with the
mail client maybe don't wait

591
00:36:56,630 --> 00:37:00,180
until the mail needs to be sent maybe
what you would do

592
00:37:00,180 --> 00:37:04,440
is look at the contacts directory

593
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:08,810
download all the the fingers for every
comp contact their

594
00:37:08,810 --> 00:37:12,230
and just saw them locally again you know
this is something that some PDP

595
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:14,329
implementations have done

596
00:37:14,329 --> 00:37:18,030
I am for a while this is system

597
00:37:18,030 --> 00:37:21,940
making more systematic and said doing it
in one protocol

598
00:37:21,940 --> 00:37:25,960
that requires plugins: we doing it full
any protocol

599
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:29,900
and leveraging that X deployed base a5
the five billion

600
00:37:29,900 --> 00:37:33,010
clouds okay oh

601
00:37:33,010 --> 00:37:37,300
so wanna so here between these

602
00:37:37,300 --> 00:37:42,869
that's the piece where interesting
Struss stuff on trust models can go

603
00:37:42,869 --> 00:37:45,980
because you've got a well-defined API

604
00:37:45,980 --> 00:37:49,359
talks he managers well defined the the

605
00:37:49,359 --> 00:37:52,880
API to talk to key users

606
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:56,160
you can then stick anything between
those points

607
00:37:56,160 --> 00:38:00,339
and you can stop testing it out and
seeing whether it works in practice

608
00:38:00,339 --> 00:38:03,990
naturally achieve your desired security
properties

609
00:38:03,990 --> 00:38:07,190
you may be required forced to eventually

610
00:38:07,190 --> 00:38:10,230
push that the infrastructure down

611
00:38:10,230 --> 00:38:13,599
into the actual mail client to achieve
your full and 2

612
00:38:13,599 --> 00:38:18,900
and I capabilities we'll be able to see
whether it works

613
00:38:18,900 --> 00:38:22,450
using the pee test that

614
00:38:22,450 --> 00:38:25,810
okay so we've done

615
00:38:25,810 --> 00:38:29,280
how do we do we done how got the

616
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:32,770
testbed up

617
00:38:32,770 --> 00:38:37,869
I we've done obviously s minds he can do
your regular certificate authority chain

618
00:38:37,869 --> 00:38:41,770
just right stuff how would we be doing

619
00:38:41,770 --> 00:38:46,380
endorsement had how he got a peer to
peer system working

620
00:38:46,380 --> 00:38:50,099
and this is something that's I I think
that we can revisits

621
00:38:50,099 --> 00:38:53,380
pgp easy when PDP was

622
00:38:53,380 --> 00:38:57,250
coming out well we were sending or
receiving mail

623
00:38:57,250 --> 00:39:00,359
from devices that was static

624
00:39:00,359 --> 00:39:04,150
you know if you got a box 11 780 you
know

625
00:39:04,150 --> 00:39:07,900
you don't put that in your pocket and
walk around with it

626
00:39:07,900 --> 00:39:12,390
it doesn't have a camera eckhardt me to
QR code

627
00:39:12,390 --> 00:39:15,450
and I think that if we're going to make
a peer to peer

628
00:39:15,450 --> 00:39:18,700
K he distribution system were

629
00:39:18,700 --> 00:39:21,839
with you the city's have cameras on them

630
00:39:21,839 --> 00:39:25,349
they can meet a QR code we could express
strong email address

631
00:39:25,349 --> 00:39:28,810
as a QR code will not be a really cool
way

632
00:39:28,810 --> 00:39:32,619
up being able to give somebody your

633
00:39:32,619 --> 00:39:36,349
strong email address so that then they
can send you encrypt email

634
00:39:36,349 --> 00:39:39,440
and nobody can fights with it

635
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:42,800
now that said you now this is research
that

636
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:46,619
please don't be did not point one
version the specs and go out and laser

637
00:39:46,619 --> 00:39:48,900
print your phone and then

638
00:39:48,900 --> 00:39:52,490
blame me if we change things

639
00:39:52,490 --> 00:39:55,650
yeah okay

640
00:39:55,650 --> 00:39:59,130
coming to the end he s hopefully we'll
have time chip questions

641
00:39:59,130 --> 00:40:02,720
I'll the one question though I P asked
by absolutely

642
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:06,440
everybody is a spam you know it's kinda
like one of those things that

643
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:10,859
he started to talk to these things like
your says I got ten words in the

644
00:40:10,859 --> 00:40:12,010
somebody in the rooms

645
00:40:12,010 --> 00:40:15,099
ok now you cannot do in 20 male spam

646
00:40:15,099 --> 00:40:18,119
spam come to end to end you know

647
00:40:18,119 --> 00:40:22,819
well actually if you can have in twenty
male

648
00:40:22,819 --> 00:40:27,569
encryption obviously the spam filter is
not going to be able to do

649
00:40:27,569 --> 00:40:31,660
spam filtering by doing content analysis

650
00:40:31,660 --> 00:40:36,240
well guess what you know I spent a lot
of time doing spam you noticed that was

651
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:39,170
a security issue in its first appeared

652
00:40:39,170 --> 00:40:42,500
very very few commercial spam filters

653
00:40:42,500 --> 00:40:48,119
use content analysis as the basis for
their spam protection services

654
00:40:48,119 --> 00:40:53,849
yes it is possibly an input to the
filter but not necessarily

655
00:40:53,849 --> 00:40:59,460
but his is never the only imports your
only if your spam filtering depends upon

656
00:40:59,460 --> 00:41:01,710
content analysis alone

657
00:41:01,710 --> 00:41:05,609
hippie hippie lettuce back

658
00:41:05,609 --> 00:41:09,319
so yes and it is an issue

659
00:41:09,319 --> 00:41:12,930
you know what if you cannot use

660
00:41:12,930 --> 00:41:18,500
end to end Eve its email encryption well
don't

661
00:41:18,500 --> 00:41:21,869
give the spam filter a

662
00:41:21,869 --> 00:41:26,329
key encrypt tell people to encrypt their
mail

663
00:41:26,329 --> 00:41:29,329
by default to that spam filter

664
00:41:29,329 --> 00:41:35,010
and for the few people who you know and
trust not to send you spam

665
00:41:35,010 --> 00:41:38,430
give them a different strong email
address that's

666
00:41:38,430 --> 00:41:43,410
doesn't go through the spam filter
problem solved

667
00:41:43,410 --> 00:41:47,400
some conclusion I'll at this was another
version

668
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:50,680
yes come out once you've gotten as an
acronym at out there

669
00:41:50,680 --> 00:41:54,599
you kinda like stuck with the initials
but

670
00:41:54,599 --> 00:41:59,599
the yeah so basically we've got secure
email encryption

671
00:41:59,599 --> 00:42:03,859
and the security is all resting on stuff
that is well tried and tested

672
00:42:03,859 --> 00:42:06,900
you know this is all based on i ATF
specs

673
00:42:06,900 --> 00:42:09,910
in the security rests on I'd expect that
to be mean

674
00:42:09,910 --> 00:42:13,040
out there in Tacitus for decades now

675
00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:19,359
I but we've added friction the security
the requires no user effort at all

676
00:42:19,359 --> 00:42:23,900
so we've got approve a concept out there
i what i'm asking for here is help to

677
00:42:23,900 --> 00:42:25,000
make that

678
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:32,000
a reality in the world thank you very
much

679
00:42:32,550 --> 00:42:39,550
how we have some time for some questions

680
00:42:40,700 --> 00:42:43,349
okay

681
00:42:43,349 --> 00:42:46,300
clear Indian crew encryption is

682
00:42:46,300 --> 00:42:49,380
important arm but that

683
00:42:49,380 --> 00:42:52,609
really to be present proof we have to
protect ourselves

684
00:42:52,609 --> 00:42:55,770
from showing our method right

685
00:42:55,770 --> 00:42:59,760
okay so I'm not really had a chance

686
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:02,790
have these won the that set to go to for

687
00:43:02,790 --> 00:43:06,180
full prism proof I i describe this I on
the web

688
00:43:06,180 --> 00:43:10,329
you're basically that is the and point
that we're working towards

689
00:43:10,329 --> 00:43:14,130
rather than something that we can
deliver this year this is all stuff

690
00:43:14,130 --> 00:43:18,460
the suffix good described here this is
all stuff you can download news today

691
00:43:18,460 --> 00:43:22,089
and it works okay so how do we get to
the point where book

692
00:43:22,089 --> 00:43:25,920
well first of all you got to do a couple
things festival

693
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:29,210
encrypting the transport between the
mail service

694
00:43:29,210 --> 00:43:32,579
and the thing about the finger we've
noticed infrastructure

695
00:43:32,579 --> 00:43:36,280
the blasts hell flowers a out by mail
server

696
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:39,349
to ask I'm gonna send mail to this party

697
00:43:39,349 --> 00:43:44,300
is 30% less is difficult for that mail
server I want to connect it

698
00:43:44,300 --> 00:43:47,410
and the on the broker I I'm not

699
00:43:47,410 --> 00:43:51,880
attack to go through the block a texture
the on both the component allows its

700
00:43:51,880 --> 00:43:56,730
that outbound mail server to query is a
pay can I use TLS to talk to them

701
00:43:56,730 --> 00:44:00,450
about will come things yes use TLS and
this is the pincer

702
00:44:00,450 --> 00:44:04,650
so that's one part so you can get the
transport layer security

703
00:44:04,650 --> 00:44:09,230
now the up but that's not necessarily
going to be enough

704
00:44:09,230 --> 00:44:12,670
because one of the things with Asmar
SMTP

705
00:44:12,670 --> 00:44:17,240
is okay we've got the storm for male
principle I say you got

706
00:44:17,240 --> 00:44:23,299
a bunch of content on your content is
2,456 K

707
00:44:23,299 --> 00:44:29,510
okay and now you've got this message
SMTP message going cross another Hall

708
00:44:29,510 --> 00:44:32,859
this is 2,456 K well

709
00:44:32,859 --> 00:44:36,230
if you've got if you're up against a
strong adversary that has

710
00:44:36,230 --> 00:44:40,650
ya global vision into yours network

711
00:44:40,650 --> 00:44:44,829
think a pretty soon work out but this
message going on this link

712
00:44:44,829 --> 00:44:49,750
with this message going on this link now
that at that point yes

713
00:44:49,750 --> 00:44:53,510
that is a fascinating problem to solve
I'm that is

714
00:44:53,510 --> 00:44:56,930
was iced I I think

715
00:44:56,930 --> 00:45:01,480
station to until Bruce kinda like rain
on my parade

716
00:45:01,480 --> 00:45:05,809
what you need to do that is replace SMTP

717
00:45:05,809 --> 00:45:11,170
but we do have a mechanism that makes
that possible because

718
00:45:11,170 --> 00:45:14,790
if you think you want to finger is doing
it is a sec descriptions up

719
00:45:14,790 --> 00:45:17,950
how you can talk to me among other
things

720
00:45:17,950 --> 00:45:21,299
Slauson that is you can change the
transport

721
00:45:21,299 --> 00:45:24,299
is that okay sir talking to me on TCP

722
00:45:24,299 --> 00:45:27,960
use tool instead of talking to me

723
00:45:27,960 --> 00:45:32,170
using SMTP use this next generation
messaging protocol

724
00:45:32,170 --> 00:45:35,770
and so their arse

725
00:45:35,770 --> 00:45:40,890
the Hawks in that allow people to hakken
really fascinating stuff

726
00:45:40,890 --> 00:45:44,520
that's the desert but I won't get a flat
weed is a

727
00:45:44,520 --> 00:45:47,540
yet I'm can couple questions

728
00:45:47,540 --> 00:45:50,790
one is I was unclear to me if your
solution

729
00:45:50,790 --> 00:45:53,940
I'm encrypts meta data like the subject
line

730
00:45:53,940 --> 00:46:00,940
I or just the body the mail I am told by
the s/mime world

731
00:46:01,599 --> 00:46:04,619
that it is possible to encrypt

732
00:46:04,619 --> 00:46:10,099
subject lines in s mine however I have
not tested

733
00:46:10,099 --> 00:46:13,809
that personally until I test it
personally

734
00:46:13,809 --> 00:46:17,490
I I don't trust them I mean like to me

735
00:46:17,490 --> 00:46:21,309
not encrypting the subject line was
raizy

736
00:46:21,309 --> 00:46:24,880
I mean Yelp I just told them that it was
stupid

737
00:46:24,880 --> 00:46:27,890
back in 1995 hit her a

738
00:46:27,890 --> 00:46:32,140
just deep I am I'm basically what you do

739
00:46:32,140 --> 00:46:35,390
issue take a an RC 82 message

740
00:46:35,390 --> 00:46:39,780
just Rapids the whole message now the
problem there

741
00:46:39,780 --> 00:46:45,130
is you still leaking information and the
problem are in the thing about president

742
00:46:45,130 --> 00:46:48,540
was it was much the subject line it was
the

743
00:46:48,540 --> 00:46:52,880
from and two addresses I'm those legal
awesome information

744
00:46:52,880 --> 00:46:57,059
and those the pieces that if you want to
swap them out

745
00:46:57,059 --> 00:47:00,339
you basically have to think about
changing out

746
00:47:00,339 --> 00:47:03,609
SMTP yes the are

747
00:47:03,609 --> 00:47:07,310
I've seen people out come from you
things

748
00:47:07,310 --> 00:47:10,890
ok second do it with an SMTP yeah but
you know you sent

749
00:47:10,890 --> 00:47:14,920
change the sending client you send
chains receiving server

750
00:47:14,920 --> 00:47:21,220
why not just go to something new among
like Jason so yes

751
00:47:21,220 --> 00:47:24,790
so the other thing that you might

752
00:47:24,790 --> 00:47:28,119
I mention is why aside from religious
reliance on the end

753
00:47:28,119 --> 00:47:31,849
and principal you don't think start TLS

754
00:47:31,849 --> 00:47:35,119
helps very much 0

755
00:47:35,119 --> 00:47:39,040
starts well might say what it is because
some people in

756
00:47:39,040 --> 00:47:43,119
okay to start TLS is is an encryption
mechanism

757
00:47:43,119 --> 00:47:46,839
that takes place the SMTP level

758
00:47:46,839 --> 00:47:50,099
I and is a really great security
solution

759
00:47:50,099 --> 00:47:54,150
and it's one that everybody should have
deployed on the mail server

760
00:47:54,150 --> 00:47:59,670
I S one the commander cells the problem
with it is that when your message is

761
00:47:59,670 --> 00:48:01,430
going across the internet

762
00:48:01,430 --> 00:48:05,020
is going through at least three hots for
civil

763
00:48:05,020 --> 00:48:08,170
your message is gonna go from your mail
client

764
00:48:08,170 --> 00:48:12,450
to the out your outbound mail server
using what is sometimes called the

765
00:48:12,450 --> 00:48:13,680
submit protocol

766
00:48:13,680 --> 00:48:17,390
but is actually just SMTP over a
separate port

767
00:48:17,390 --> 00:48:22,349
from there it goes from the out by mail
server across the internet

768
00:48:22,349 --> 00:48:25,790
to the inbound mail server on the
destination

769
00:48:25,790 --> 00:48:29,910
and that's the hot that is generally
secured with TLS

770
00:48:29,910 --> 00:48:34,329
and then finally the receivers prolly
gonna download it using pop or i'mma

771
00:48:34,329 --> 00:48:39,400
now if you want to have the mailing
cryptid you've got to have all three

772
00:48:39,400 --> 00:48:42,760
of those pieces have to be encrypt it

773
00:48:42,760 --> 00:48:47,220
number one number two if the data

774
00:48:47,220 --> 00:48:50,440
is going to sit on the mail server

775
00:48:50,440 --> 00:48:53,970
inside Google's infrastructure say

776
00:48:53,970 --> 00:48:59,540
then all the communication lines is
communicated across

777
00:48:59,540 --> 00:49:02,619
inside google also have to be secured

778
00:49:02,619 --> 00:49:06,440
otherwise we get back to the infamous an
essay slide

779
00:49:06,440 --> 00:49:12,220
SSL applied and removed here

780
00:49:12,220 --> 00:49:16,589
so is a very important security control

781
00:49:16,589 --> 00:49:19,780
and at the moment that's the only
standard base control

782
00:49:19,780 --> 00:49:23,049
this is going to protect your meta data

783
00:49:23,049 --> 00:49:26,270
but unfortunately it's not going to give
you and two

784
00:49:26,270 --> 00:49:29,290
and encryption your content

785
00:49:29,290 --> 00:49:32,980
and one other things that you know back
in the nineteen nineties be used to have

786
00:49:32,980 --> 00:49:33,680
these debates

787
00:49:33,680 --> 00:49:37,960
over black should you do encryption

788
00:49:37,960 --> 00:49:43,430
should you do it at the message where
all should you do it the transport layer

789
00:49:43,430 --> 00:49:48,829
and now we know the answer to that is
and

790
00:49:48,829 --> 00:49:52,279
you want to encrypt every message

791
00:49:52,279 --> 00:49:56,569
at the message layer and the transport
layer message less security is not

792
00:49:56,569 --> 00:49:58,839
substitute transport layer security

793
00:49:58,839 --> 00:50:05,839
transport layer security is not a
substitute for message sqft

794
00:50:07,200 --> 00:50:10,790
you see this working at with web-based
email like Gmail

795
00:50:10,790 --> 00:50:13,839
especially since features like search
require them to have access to the

796
00:50:13,839 --> 00:50:14,829
plaintext

797
00:50:14,829 --> 00:50:18,640
okay yeah this is actually when I get a
lot a slut because

798
00:50:18,640 --> 00:50:21,960
I was recently involved in a court case
involving the

799
00:50:21,960 --> 00:50:26,589
webmail it was one other yep I spent a
lotta Topp my time doing

800
00:50:26,589 --> 00:50:30,010
the work is a expert witness in patent
cases

801
00:50:30,010 --> 00:50:34,450
and the reason for that is that you know
I don't have a choice

802
00:50:34,450 --> 00:50:38,559
in being a witness in these cases I only
have a choice as to whether I get paid

803
00:50:38,559 --> 00:50:39,750
or not

804
00:50:39,750 --> 00:50:44,240
and we sitting around the room and the
eight people in the room

805
00:50:44,240 --> 00:50:47,359
and you're the only person who's not
getting paid

806
00:50:47,359 --> 00:50:51,200
kinda sucks and while the things that

807
00:50:51,200 --> 00:50:54,390
this was a a case involving acclaim

808
00:50:54,390 --> 00:50:59,559
on webmail and the party trying to
invent it is and I came out and said

809
00:50:59,559 --> 00:51:00,770
well now

810
00:51:00,770 --> 00:51:05,460
I had webmail running first I can prove
that I did it before them because

811
00:51:05,460 --> 00:51:10,400
I had to go up to 10 and fix the hasty
be protocol

812
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:14,720
cuz the post command didn't work at the
time

813
00:51:14,720 --> 00:51:18,160
so you know I I invented webmail

814
00:51:18,160 --> 00:51:21,730
that's kinda something to boast about
yeah a

815
00:51:21,730 --> 00:51:27,069
yes doing webmail is an important thing
that we've got to get done for whole

816
00:51:27,069 --> 00:51:28,310
system

817
00:51:28,310 --> 00:51:31,930
up there's a couple ways he could do it

818
00:51:31,930 --> 00:51:35,089
the best way for me as far as i'm
concerned. would be

819
00:51:35,089 --> 00:51:38,450
to have a an HTML widget which would be

820
00:51:38,450 --> 00:51:42,420
secure editing environment where people
can like email

821
00:51:42,420 --> 00:51:45,859
and then that would dump out I'll and
encrypt it block

822
00:51:45,859 --> 00:51:50,170
than that was visible by JavaScript and
then that could be processed this is

823
00:51:50,170 --> 00:51:51,119
normal

824
00:51:51,119 --> 00:51:54,970
webmail dates right other the is a team

825
00:51:54,970 --> 00:51:58,109
Google I who

826
00:51:58,109 --> 00:52:01,950
a working they did not PTP working
inside Gmail

827
00:52:01,950 --> 00:52:04,990
I've not had a chance to talk sit down
and talk to them

828
00:52:04,990 --> 00:52:08,200
I will be talking with them I next week

829
00:52:08,200 --> 00:52:12,119
a I'm going straight in this conference
to Toronto to the idea of

830
00:52:12,119 --> 00:52:15,500
I've got some time booked out with
penalized talk about some

831
00:52:15,500 --> 00:52:19,740
I believe it's possible just have had
time to do it

832
00:52:19,740 --> 00:52:24,390
yes I'm curious about certificate are
the descriptions your posting

833
00:52:24,390 --> 00:52:27,430
you said any web server how do you want
to indicate that how would you keep

834
00:52:27,430 --> 00:52:28,829
someone

835
00:52:28,829 --> 00:52:33,140
from doing what you described with the
spam filter

836
00:52:33,140 --> 00:52:36,380
unzipping it taking a look zipping it up
t

837
00:52:36,380 --> 00:52:39,980
the actual a cited

838
00:52:39,980 --> 00:52:44,589
action I you said the description

839
00:52:44,589 --> 00:52:48,560
the message gets posted on any website
which need to be posted anyway I'll

840
00:52:48,560 --> 00:52:52,640
okay something that doesn't need to be
encrypt it or whatever

841
00:52:52,640 --> 00:52:56,750
is because all the data that the and
parties going to rely on

842
00:52:56,750 --> 00:53:00,259
is signed data Cy Young Justice your key
ons

843
00:53:00,259 --> 00:53:04,369
the fingers in just the key it is the ma
sticky

844
00:53:04,369 --> 00:53:08,730
which is validated by the finger by the
fingerprint

845
00:53:08,730 --> 00:53:12,529
the master key then signs the online key

846
00:53:12,529 --> 00:53:16,069
the online he then sends sign the end
entity keys

847
00:53:16,069 --> 00:53:19,839
so all the data that you'll relying on

848
00:53:19,839 --> 00:53:24,200
has a trust path that goes back up to
them the fingerprint

849
00:53:24,200 --> 00:53:27,569
and that's what you started with as
iraq's ima trust

850
00:53:27,569 --> 00:53:30,589
and then the problem developing
alternative trust models

851
00:53:30,589 --> 00:53:34,529
simply becomes a problem %uh mapping any
email address

852
00:53:34,529 --> 00:53:39,250
to a fingerprint and if you got that the
into all sorts of interesting things

853
00:53:39,250 --> 00:53:42,480
I think I'm at a time that thank you
very much for

854
00:53:42,480 --> 00:53:46,410
listening and go anybody is in doing
this stuff

855
00:53:46,410 --> 00:53:49,500
the Sign up button on my website has
improved all

856
00:53:49,500 --> 00:53:56,500
thank you very much

857

backgrounds in a Dutch

893
01:06:56,710 --> 01:07:00,069
agriculture and today we're going to
talk about diversity

894
01:07:00,069 --> 01:07:04,670
a issues around that and so must my cues
must stop I know arse

895

about ourselves

911
01:08:07,780 --> 01:08:11,599
not only a few gonna we have to save
ourselves but we also got a

912
01:08:11,599 --> 01:08:13,079
responsibility to say

913
01:08:13,079 --> 01:08:18,569
a everybody else you know Tiger I'm not
a guy who makes a pizza or doctors are

916
01:08:22,759 --> 01:08:26,259

917
01:08:26,259 --> 01:08:29,890
our way out of this mess I am

918

922
01:08:47,560 --> 01:08:52,730
never post to read though Louis carried
a list and I go to European acerca

923
01:08:52,730 --> 01:08:57,430
I'm sorry just starting my own story
larry year well my Raspberry Pi

924
01:08:57,430 --> 01:09:00,509
but I contact my way even out over
paperback

925
01:09:00,509 --> 01:09:04,210
any year of snow tonight more and more
ensure

926
01:09:04,210 --> 01:09:09,130
if any of this stuff makes any sense at
all if I look at amount of hope salute I

927
01:09:09,130 --> 01:09:10,200
have to jump through

928
01:09:10,200 --> 01:09:13,689
tonight showed my security just even a
little bit

929
01:09:13,690 --> 01:09:17,259
a I really wanna like how

930
01:09:17,259 --> 01:09:21,060
are my mom my doctor and my favorite
pizza maker

931
01:09:21,060 --> 01:09:25,029
ever gonna do this are gonna do pull it
together power to Canada's

932
01:09:25,029 --> 01:09:29,910
defend themselves from the closet man
surveillance and I know so you have

933
01:09:29,910 --> 01:09:30,569
answers

934
01:09:30,569 --> 01:09:35,299
like many of your many answers actually
and sunny day unfolds like a great deal

935
01:09:35,299 --> 01:09:37,219
of the same abbreviation lingo

936
01:09:37,219 --> 01:09:41,600
that we know from the leaks you know
your people saying we just have to otro

937
01:09:41,600 --> 01:09:42,589
for TLS

938
01:09:42,589 --> 01:09:45,960
using PFS and you store to exchange a
p2p

939
01:09:45,960 --> 01:09:48,960
right wrong

940
01:09:48,960 --> 01:09:53,029
or no not again and no that's right we
have to do not ship rabbi I love it

941
01:09:53,029 --> 01:09:56,210
you know that's great that's that's
literally world's a

942
01:09:56,210 --> 01:09:59,890
we have to do but it's not enough for us

943
01:09:59,890 --> 01:10:04,929
a we have 20 TR over TLS would be a
first order pizza

944
01:10:04,929 --> 01:10:10,060
refuse store to order medicine and we
for sure like how issues bitch be to

945
01:10:10,060 --> 01:10:11,290
communicate with your mom

946
01:10:11,290 --> 01:10:16,760
we have to get this to sew them to make
sure that we can be safe

947
01:10:16,760 --> 01:10:21,420
if they're not going to use it we're
gonna stand out like a sore from

948
01:10:21,420 --> 01:10:25,320
because really only one and i'm having
our security to unlock

949
01:10:25,320 --> 01:10:29,660
a good level a decent level so what is
talks about is

950
01:10:29,660 --> 01:10:33,270
that we need to diversify ever gonna
save ourselves

951
01:10:33,270 --> 01:10:37,050
we need to have diversity in our
community

952
01:10:37,050 --> 01:10:40,940
because we have to make tools beers make
sure to tools remade can be used by a

953
01:10:40,940 --> 01:10:43,760
baker's doctors a mom's

954
01:10:43,760 --> 01:10:48,219
so could it be that most the tools we
make are not being used by them

955
01:10:48,219 --> 01:10:52,450
because redesign them for ourselves and
for our close friends

956
01:10:52,450 --> 01:10:57,190
like when was the last time you try you
ask a little brother to run your code

957
01:10:57,190 --> 01:11:01,890
when you ask your grandma to fire up the
program it is just me

958
01:11:01,890 --> 01:11:05,200
like when was the last time for
everybody was running as our mail server

959
01:11:05,200 --> 01:11:06,010
like

960
01:11:06,010 --> 01:11:09,150
when was the last time you looked into
webmail interface

961
01:11:09,150 --> 01:11:12,910
that eighty percent to users are using

962
01:11:12,910 --> 01:11:17,950
sorry did you select design in my belief
that once we're going to use programs

963
01:11:17,950 --> 01:11:22,830
must be part of the design and
development process from the start

964
01:11:22,830 --> 01:11:26,500
related to notice people are going to
use her go to save lives on the other

965
01:11:26,500 --> 01:11:27,969
side door of

966
01:11:27,969 --> 01:11:32,420
many of us don't have a new research
budgets Google or to Facebook's

967
01:11:32,420 --> 01:11:36,140
to get an exact profile to whims and
wishes serve our users

968
01:11:36,140 --> 01:11:40,110
so we have to meet him face to face we
have to meet with them

969
01:11:40,110 --> 01:11:43,590
to name one day needs every need to be
part of their struggles

970
01:11:43,590 --> 01:11:47,239
an order stories so we need to diversify

971
01:11:47,239 --> 01:11:51,250
also because there's no one solution
there are people who say we need

972
01:11:51,250 --> 01:11:52,580
technical solutions

973
01:11:52,580 --> 01:11:55,820
there are people we save any political
solutions

974
01:11:55,820 --> 01:11:59,280
and just maybe in your apt word excerpt
group so won't solve anything

975
01:11:59,280 --> 01:12:03,140
if your politics is down the drain

976
01:12:03,140 --> 01:12:06,410
but only policía political solutions 1
work either

977
01:12:06,410 --> 01:12:10,530
a in our site /a a referee rightly
pointed out in our talk at the noises

978
01:12:10,530 --> 01:12:11,690
square at home

979
01:12:11,690 --> 01:12:14,730
after camp last year an army of people
were there

980
01:12:14,730 --> 01:12:19,000
I know quite a few a but what she said
is dad's

981
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:25,500
um there once basically we're not gonna
policy is in place in a political level

982
01:12:25,500 --> 01:12:29,410
it doesn't disappear anymore sure
memorized

983
01:12:29,410 --> 01:12:34,070
one location and a quarter on it she
said the NSA that's very politely in

984
01:12:34,070 --> 01:12:35,090
ninety-seven

985
01:12:35,090 --> 01:12:38,830
frightened 9075 turn off that telegram

986
01:12:38,830 --> 01:12:43,120
surveillance program it had never been

987
01:12:43,120 --> 01:12:46,560
it had never in their entire history
produced anything useful

988
01:12:46,560 --> 01:12:49,989
so this are one example over
technological capability

989
01:12:49,989 --> 01:12:54,520
being rolled back so much for history

990
01:12:54,520 --> 01:12:57,820
furthermore you have an additional
problem here and once again this is

991
01:12:57,820 --> 01:12:59,840
trade routes from Allah

992
01:12:59,840 --> 01:13:03,420
she says Dennis eight types every
politician's email

993
01:13:03,420 --> 01:13:06,530
and even anybody who might become a
politician that up their phones that a

994
01:13:06,530 --> 01:13:07,550
very male

995
01:13:07,550 --> 01:13:10,739
March lieber better it is for national
security reasons

996
01:13:10,739 --> 01:13:13,960
they need to know if these people are
sold out to somebody

997
01:13:13,960 --> 01:13:19,179
or any number justifications but it also
means today are all the dirt on you

998
01:13:19,179 --> 01:13:22,450
all the polluter all a political
politicians.

999
01:13:22,450 --> 01:13:25,750
now how easy do you think it is to keep
a politician balls

1000
01:13:25,750 --> 01:13:28,870
if their carrier can be destroyed at any
moment

1001
01:13:28,870 --> 01:13:33,020
how well do you think their long-term
policy will go is going to be

1002
01:13:33,020 --> 01:13:38,739
when they know that if they stand up to
you too much they get destroyed

1003
01:13:38,739 --> 01:13:41,920
so we need to diversify to find a
political better battles

1004
01:13:41,920 --> 01:13:45,440
internationally and I'm sorry to say but
I have more friends

1005
01:13:45,440 --> 01:13:48,700
at this moment in Germany Poland the
Netherlands I'm

1006
01:13:48,700 --> 01:13:51,960
maybe even Brazil and is regarding the
US

1007
01:13:51,960 --> 01:13:55,760
but we need to help a view to give our
government in check

1008
01:13:55,760 --> 01:14:00,040
review re you renewed give our position
checks also %um

1009
01:14:00,040 --> 01:14:04,090
safe place to hide read international
coalitions and show the US for

1010
01:14:04,090 --> 01:14:05,360
international pressure

1011
01:14:05,360 --> 01:14:09,860
but they are backwards in destroying it
only businesses but freedom at large

1012
01:14:09,860 --> 01:14:13,190
really diverse city because many of us

1013
01:14:13,190 --> 01:14:17,340
a business circle jerking an echo
chamber

1014
01:14:17,340 --> 01:14:21,460
and sorry to be personal but is a shout
out to make some money in spike

1015
01:14:21,460 --> 01:14:25,190
was making great stuff like just secure
Eretz phone

1016
01:14:25,190 --> 01:14:29,429
but two weeks ago you find it necessary
to call out on Twitter asking people not

1017
01:14:29,429 --> 01:14:31,469
to fund group accounts for Android

1018
01:14:31,469 --> 01:14:36,760
but I stance France his project and what
is works great as standard police just

1019
01:14:36,760 --> 01:14:38,120
messing around

1020
01:14:38,120 --> 01:14:41,910
you might even be right to death but the
finger it's good to have just one crypto

1021
01:14:41,910 --> 01:14:42,980
ap

1022
01:14:42,980 --> 01:14:47,540
and on multiple is beyond me anyone with
some basic understanding of biology

1023
01:14:47,540 --> 01:14:50,929
knows where monoculture comedian in a
time of crisis

1024
01:14:50,929 --> 01:14:54,040
renewed many different tools and in many
different people we need to make sure

1025
01:14:54,040 --> 01:14:55,980
that everybody dies

1026
01:14:55,980 --> 01:14:59,480
when one heart bleeds

1027
01:14:59,480 --> 01:15:02,560
so many diverse T because we're going to
die

1028
01:15:02,560 --> 01:15:06,719
and I mean that literally renewed
coaters doing journalism in a journalist

1029
01:15:06,719 --> 01:15:10,140
coding read activist doctors lawyers
teachers civil surgeons

1030
01:15:10,140 --> 01:15:13,270
and even the prong business
understanding their jobs

1031
01:15:13,270 --> 01:15:18,440
will become impossible without security
and privacy

1032
01:15:18,440 --> 01:15:21,710
I also don't see does is opposing things
with many people would like to frame it

1033
01:15:21,710 --> 01:15:22,120
both

1034
01:15:22,120 --> 01:15:26,440
you can have privacy without security in
the other way around

1035
01:15:26,440 --> 01:15:30,690
we're gonna be targeted at and 100 in
smoke out over mangoes

1036
01:15:30,690 --> 01:15:34,940
like xkcd says we're going to drugs and
be done with a five dollar crank

1037
01:15:34,940 --> 01:15:39,760
and 4,096 bit errors encryption will not
sign up for us

1038
01:15:39,760 --> 01:15:44,060
so we need to diversify and open up our
communities to LGBT community

1039
01:15:44,060 --> 01:15:48,100
the Syrian fighters are just academics
and Mexicans trying to defend themselves

1040
01:15:48,100 --> 01:15:49,530
against drug cartels

1041
01:15:49,530 --> 01:15:52,900
read understand that their struggles to
empower them

1042
01:15:52,900 --> 01:15:56,040
and they are ready they want to

1043
01:15:56,040 --> 01:15:59,840
there was a reason call for academic
papers to mathematicians

1044
01:15:59,840 --> 01:16:03,300
and the NSA only on the site subject of
an essay

1045
01:16:03,300 --> 01:16:06,410
manager so this submission scoring
titles like

1046
01:16:06,410 --> 01:16:09,650
mathematician shouldn't severe ties with
the NSA

1047
01:16:09,650 --> 01:16:13,650
and there is a long-term security
depends on freedom

1048
01:16:13,650 --> 01:16:17,880
and that as a back door to an ISD

1049
01:16:17,880 --> 01:16:22,610
and this year every major art academy in
a maryland says students graduating

1050
01:16:22,610 --> 01:16:26,570
retard works dealing with privacy
surveillance and technology

1051
01:16:26,570 --> 01:16:31,750
Syrians fighting both ices and Assad's
wants and needs to mesh networks

1052
01:16:31,750 --> 01:16:35,050
and pizza bakers once an all out effort
or in service

1053
01:16:35,050 --> 01:16:38,989
delivery service accepting bets going
they are ready to make

1054
01:16:38,989 --> 01:16:42,219
our knowledge and craftsmanship global

1055
01:16:42,219 --> 01:16:45,969
and nose art us to be ready and make
sure we can welcome other ideas cultures

1056
01:16:45,969 --> 01:16:47,410
and insights

1057
01:16:47,410 --> 01:16:54,410
with open arms thank you

1058
01:16:57,870 --> 01:17:01,200
so I'm a little nervous and when I get
there is a

1059
01:17:01,200 --> 01:17:04,650
speak Spanglish so I apologize in
advance

1060
01:17:04,650 --> 01:17:08,730
it I'm gonna top a little bit about what
it

1061
01:17:08,730 --> 01:17:13,239
feels like I'll be a bicultural person
working in open source

1062
01:17:13,239 --> 01:17:16,929
and some other things that i've seen I
mean if you know a whole bunch of

1063
01:17:16,929 --> 01:17:18,790
Information Act you in pyruvate

1064
01:17:18,790 --> 01:17:23,360
is just too checkers some thoughts and
comments and questions later on

1065
01:17:23,360 --> 01:17:27,670
a.m. in these conversations I find
really interesting is that a lot of

1066
01:17:27,670 --> 01:17:28,660
times

1067
01:17:28,660 --> 01:17:32,260
I the conversation you have the people
that are acted very

1068
01:17:32,260 --> 01:17:36,270
and there's people that I you know maybe
your white guy

1069
01:17:36,270 --> 01:17:40,429
with computer decree and you think well
doesn't affect me like I i care about

1070
01:17:40,429 --> 01:17:42,830
this but it doesn't affect me so I don't
know how to help

1071
01:17:42,830 --> 01:17:46,170
one here to tell you that we actually
need your help for cultural change to

1072
01:17:46,170 --> 01:17:46,830
happen

1073
01:17:46,830 --> 01:17:49,910
has two be a priority for the tribe

1074
01:17:49,910 --> 01:17:53,660
and diversity is actually really
important played out shared

1075
01:17:53,660 --> 01:17:57,010
but also because over city makes things
more fun and makes

1076
01:17:57,010 --> 01:18:01,590
things were interesting we're also going
to produce better products and services

1077
01:18:01,590 --> 01:18:04,739
it's really the right thing to do news
actually

1078
01:18:04,739 --> 01:18:08,700
car teen where a guy

1079
01:18:08,700 --> 01:18:12,030
breaks into another guy's room is like
you're the reason that there's no

1080
01:18:12,030 --> 01:18:14,000
guarantee girls here man Lake

1081
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:19,310
stop you know so we need your help and
it has to come from the community and

1082
01:18:19,310 --> 01:18:20,690
not just like

1083
01:18:20,690 --> 01:18:25,450
you know the few people are affected so
when I talk about culture

1084
01:18:25,450 --> 01:18:29,260
arm I really like they give people a
little bit my background is so that you

1085
01:18:29,260 --> 01:18:31,469
guys understand what my preferences are

1086
01:18:31,469 --> 01:18:35,219
you know what my biases may be and I'm a
native New Yorker

1087
01:18:35,219 --> 01:18:39,530
and I grew up in the Bronx in Yonkers
anyen native New Yorkers in here

1088
01:18:39,530 --> 01:18:42,800
yeah what's up I'm am a latina

1089
01:18:42,800 --> 01:18:47,469
on my parents were immigrants from cuba
in Spain I also sama baptize Dominican

1090
01:18:47,469 --> 01:18:50,600
a group working in a butcher shop in
Washington Heights it's in North

1091
01:18:50,600 --> 01:18:51,660
Manhattan

1092
01:18:51,660 --> 01:18:55,830
I am I love goddess stuff like I have
got a synergy everywhere

1093
01:18:55,830 --> 01:18:59,170
in regards to raise I come from a
multiracial family

1094
01:18:59,170 --> 01:19:02,200
from a Cuban side in the merits a condo

1095
01:19:02,200 --> 01:19:07,210
and in terms of open source week PO's
make a week drug into open sewers so

1096
01:19:07,210 --> 01:19:10,969
I am thats eventually hey I got here

1097
01:19:10,969 --> 01:19:14,150
but as a bicultural person

1098
01:19:14,150 --> 01:19:17,179
I think of culture very much like a

1099
01:19:17,179 --> 01:19:20,179
kinda like attack great the bodies the
hardware

1100
01:19:20,179 --> 01:19:23,460
and the culture is the program and

1101
01:19:23,460 --> 01:19:26,790
you can have various programs I in you

1102
01:19:26,790 --> 01:19:29,810
writes it could be your nationality

1103
01:19:29,810 --> 01:19:33,370
it could be a raise are sexual
orientation

1104
01:19:33,370 --> 01:19:37,160
and just like a program culture can be
patched

1105
01:19:37,160 --> 01:19:40,850
it can be updated or it can be
completely deleted rate

1106
01:19:40,850 --> 01:19:44,670
and I think that that's something view
the really important to I keep in mind

1107
01:19:44,670 --> 01:19:45,150
right

1108
01:19:45,150 --> 01:19:48,660
cultures not stagnate actually involves
and you can involve

1109
01:19:48,660 --> 01:19:52,540
your own culture the good news is that

1110
01:19:52,540 --> 01:19:56,310
everybody in this room is a kaleidoscope
love cultures

1111
01:19:56,310 --> 01:20:00,600
a and floss is also a Clive scope of
cultures

1112
01:20:00,600 --> 01:20:04,450
the bad news is you're probably not
aware how your cultural programming fax

1113
01:20:04,450 --> 01:20:05,040
you

1114
01:20:05,040 --> 01:20:09,380
most people there where are aware
because they have to compete or three

1115
01:20:09,380 --> 01:20:11,000
competing programs in them

1116
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:14,520
that want to compete for your brain and
they're posing rate

1117
01:20:14,520 --> 01:20:18,890
so for example by cultural kid is
constantly thinking

1118
01:20:18,890 --> 01:20:22,920
well this side tells me to do this this
site tells me to do this and I don't

1119
01:20:22,920 --> 01:20:23,540
know

1120
01:20:23,540 --> 01:20:27,340
right and the thing with open source
projects

1121
01:20:27,340 --> 01:20:31,080
is that a lot of times we not aware love
are quarter

1122
01:20:31,080 --> 01:20:34,770
rate we're not really add step taken a
step back

1123
01:20:34,770 --> 01:20:37,840
in looking at who's there a

1124
01:20:37,840 --> 01:20:40,969
where the quarter classes that are
taking place

1125
01:20:40,969 --> 01:20:44,520
just being a little bit more
conscientious about right

1126
01:20:44,520 --> 01:20:47,350
and it's also really important to
understand that just because you have a

1127
01:20:47,350 --> 01:20:47,840
def by

1128
01:20:47,840 --> 01:20:51,840
diversity like you have a device direct
divers RAM

1129
01:20:51,840 --> 01:20:55,090
it doesn't mean that it's day versity
friendly right

1130
01:20:55,090 --> 01:20:59,739
a diver silly friendly space has several
Sarah characteristics to make a

1131
01:20:59,739 --> 01:21:03,230
welcome mean and open to everyone

1132
01:21:03,230 --> 01:21:06,670
these are just some facts and figures I
tried to look around for stuff

1133
01:21:06,670 --> 01:21:11,489
I am things that I come across a I by no
means am a researcher so this is just

1134
01:21:11,489 --> 01:21:14,800
these are things I found that we're like
interesting I'll

1135
01:21:14,800 --> 01:21:20,570
there is a 2 2012 study over 270,000
open source projects your dancers French

1136
01:21:20,570 --> 01:21:23,310
and they found that the largest
contributors came from Europe in the

1137
01:21:23,310 --> 01:21:24,600
United States

1138
01:21:24,600 --> 01:21:28,010
hour depending on the city's that you
read are women make up

1139
01:21:28,010 --> 01:21:31,250
anywhere from 1.5 to 3 percent the FOSS
community

1140
01:21:31,250 --> 01:21:34,600
obviously some projects have a higher
percentage than others

1141
01:21:34,600 --> 01:21:39,219
on a site that we could P editors just
because like we could pee is a project

1142
01:21:39,219 --> 01:21:40,250
that

1143
01:21:40,250 --> 01:21:43,540
am you probably don't need that much tax
because you're editing

1144
01:21:43,540 --> 01:21:48,219
articles right but at the same time it's
only .5 percent said there's a review

1145
01:21:48,219 --> 01:21:49,880
the huge gender gap

1146
01:21:49,880 --> 01:21:53,150
and they did a study not too long ago
damn sure you is all right

1147
01:21:53,150 --> 01:21:57,520
or at least it's on the news where the
typical on study found that the typical

1148
01:21:57,520 --> 01:22:01,340
bouncers right now 30 years old from
Europe and the United States

1149
01:22:01,340 --> 01:22:05,310
in terms if presented to people of color
in open source actually couldn't find

1150
01:22:05,310 --> 01:22:07,030
any study or research

1151
01:22:07,030 --> 01:22:10,310
I'm a few days do you know any please
just let me know

1152
01:22:10,310 --> 01:22:14,690
I'll what I did find no is just our
studies of Technology

1153
01:22:14,690 --> 01:22:19,400
in general I'll 3 percent here in the
United States 2 percent in the computing

1154
01:22:19,400 --> 01:22:20,010
work

1155
01:22:20,010 --> 01:22:23,250
force her black women 2 percent are
Latino this

1156
01:22:23,250 --> 01:22:27,860
5 percent are Asian women I recent
report from Mercury News

1157
01:22:27,860 --> 01:22:31,830
e said that basically the disparity in
SoCal Bali

1158
01:22:31,830 --> 01:22:35,980
is getting worse for minorities I'm
which is really surprising cuz

1159
01:22:35,980 --> 01:22:39,830
you would think you would actually get
better now right and and then also one

1160
01:22:39,830 --> 01:22:43,030
thing I've noticed about open source
that you guys are no

1161
01:22:43,030 --> 01:22:46,270
tuck obviously very English dominated I
am

1162
01:22:46,270 --> 01:22:50,670
and because it that Lake that usually
means are you hand your also

1163
01:22:50,670 --> 01:22:53,540
unit act on it so that means you don't
usually have enough money to buy a piece

1164
01:22:53,540 --> 01:22:54,929
like a laptop right

1165
01:22:54,929 --> 01:22:58,000
so there's definitely a lack of
socioeconomic diversity

1166
01:22:58,000 --> 01:23:02,510
on one of the things I did for this
presentation

1167
01:23:02,510 --> 01:23:07,170
and was kinda I went to spanish-speaking
open source communities in a ask them

1168
01:23:07,170 --> 01:23:10,170
or to some other issues that you guys
have freight

1169
01:23:10,170 --> 01:23:14,850
so these are some this is some the
feedback I got back

1170
01:23:14,850 --> 01:23:18,760
everything is done in English all not
always be generally

1171
01:23:18,760 --> 01:23:22,080
everything was first created in English
and then translated right

1172
01:23:22,080 --> 01:23:26,219
so a lot I'm feel that they're not
actually part of the creative process

1173
01:23:26,219 --> 01:23:29,800
in many ways there's this almost like
this thing in the back of the head that

1174
01:23:29,800 --> 01:23:34,239
someone feel that they have to ask for
permission to do things are to join rate

1175
01:23:34,239 --> 01:23:38,719
on it's also hard to participate if you
don't know the language well

1176
01:23:38,719 --> 01:23:41,820
also in which speakers are more scene
and celebrated

1177
01:23:41,820 --> 01:23:46,320
so they if you have a Spanish speaker
order any other language that

1178
01:23:46,320 --> 01:23:49,719
I'll is actually really really good at
what they what they do

1179
01:23:49,719 --> 01:23:53,650
but they don't speak English they may
not be Lake ASEAN panels and we may be

1180
01:23:53,650 --> 01:23:55,820
in your particular country but they can
learn

1181
01:23:55,820 --> 01:23:59,139
you know general international tech
community lake he may not come

1182
01:23:59,139 --> 01:24:02,860
to like a panel B speakers be on an
expert list

1183
01:24:02,860 --> 01:24:06,219
I'm also summon them felt that on

1184
01:24:06,219 --> 01:24:10,320
the anglo or western ways always
considered to be the correct way

1185
01:24:10,320 --> 01:24:14,110
right this in a bit inability to
understand that people do things

1186
01:24:14,110 --> 01:24:16,340
differently the process things
differently

1187
01:24:16,340 --> 01:24:19,880
they collaborate differently and that's
something that a lot and fell

1188
01:24:19,880 --> 01:24:23,070
and it was like actually quite emotional
for them

1189
01:24:23,070 --> 01:24:26,760
and they also feel that at times are the
our community

1190
01:24:26,760 --> 01:24:29,770
donors so we appreciate your taking
advantage of the fact that there are

1191
01:24:29,770 --> 01:24:33,060
different mentalities it there's
different ways to view the world that

1192
01:24:33,060 --> 01:24:36,570
you know they're their you're taking
into account different things

1193
01:24:36,570 --> 01:24:39,800
so it's not just the language barrier
it's actually a culture cash

1194
01:24:39,800 --> 01:24:43,139
and actually like when you go to a lot
of good the open source projects like in

1195
01:24:43,139 --> 01:24:44,510
your volunteering in them

1196
01:24:44,510 --> 01:24:48,320
you see you'll see somebody's culture
clash happen right

1197
01:24:48,320 --> 01:24:53,400
on also along those lines arm decisions
are taking from the English Pointer view

1198
01:24:53,400 --> 01:24:57,120
I'll give you a perfect example there's
one particular project that launched the

1199
01:24:57,120 --> 01:24:58,660
magazine right

1200
01:24:58,660 --> 01:25:01,969
and now I'm there it was only in English

1201
01:25:01,969 --> 01:25:06,679
finally they finally got volunteers in
their translating in Spanish but

1202
01:25:06,679 --> 01:25:09,920
at the end of the day the editorial
decisions are made in English to me by

1203
01:25:09,920 --> 01:25:11,130
English speakers rate

1204
01:25:11,130 --> 01:25:14,650
so on this is something I was commented

1205
01:25:14,650 --> 01:25:18,929
also as you guys are no decisions are
made on specific time zone so

1206
01:25:18,929 --> 01:25:23,230
if some you know one particular region
to sleep when they wake up there like

1207
01:25:23,230 --> 01:25:24,630
way to get it this is not

1208
01:25:24,630 --> 01:25:29,820
I'm not not cool at this you know I'm
the next 1i think affects not just

1209
01:25:29,820 --> 01:25:33,360
Scorchers that may be opposed to this
but also personalities rate

1210
01:25:33,360 --> 01:25:36,679
there's definitely a level of
aggressiveness in competitiveness in

1211
01:25:36,679 --> 01:25:37,480
open source

1212
01:25:37,480 --> 01:25:41,580
that you see a lot mailing list rate
that it kinda pushes people away kinda

1213
01:25:41,580 --> 01:25:45,219
intimidates people from morning to you
participate right

1214
01:25:45,219 --> 01:25:48,980
an and that's where we say mailing lists
are bad for your health

1215
01:25:48,980 --> 01:25:52,400
because Lake can't tell you how many
times I see people like mostly

1216
01:25:52,400 --> 01:25:57,239
like disturbed by this on and then
obviously

1217
01:25:57,239 --> 01:26:00,870
you know the way that people see open
source Bewley is

1218
01:26:00,870 --> 01:26:03,950
influenced by a quarter so arm bone

1219
01:26:03,950 --> 01:26:07,290
you a few particular people are
returning to and made the distinction

1220
01:26:07,290 --> 01:26:11,489
the in the US for example may have a
more libertarian amor free speech

1221
01:26:11,489 --> 01:26:15,310
you know angolan in Latin America may
have a more social just a single

1222
01:26:15,310 --> 01:26:18,989
so yesterday we did to meet ups

1223
01:26:18,989 --> 01:26:23,340
at my the square on and if you guys are
around later please past nine races

1224
01:26:23,340 --> 01:26:24,960
where we'd love to have you there

1225
01:26:24,960 --> 01:26:28,360
we did one and I and diversity and we
did a woman's group in this is some

1226
01:26:28,360 --> 01:26:29,719
other feedback we got there

1227
01:26:29,719 --> 01:26:33,760
we did like a little workshop on and
this is so the crowd basically these are

1228
01:26:33,760 --> 01:26:35,280
some other comments we got

1229
01:26:35,280 --> 01:26:40,250
I'll there's no role models and there's
a lack investment in diverse cities a

1230
01:26:40,250 --> 01:26:40,630
lake

1231
01:26:40,630 --> 01:26:44,960
organizers think Diversey is an
astronaut there's no process so that

1232
01:26:44,960 --> 01:26:49,639
it's an integral part of the process and
if this is gonna be a priority we really

1233
01:26:49,639 --> 01:26:50,940
have to

1234
01:26:50,940 --> 01:26:54,070
think be conscious a diversity from the
very beginning a

1235
01:26:54,070 --> 01:26:58,020
anything that you're organizing right on
also

1236
01:26:58,020 --> 01:27:01,330
they feel like a lot of people may not
see the value in diversity

1237
01:27:01,330 --> 01:27:05,040
like why why but why is this important

1238
01:27:05,040 --> 01:27:08,310
I am also even though open source is
very international

1239
01:27:08,310 --> 01:27:11,929
he kinda has a monoculture right Lake

1240
01:27:11,929 --> 01:27:15,190
more than likely you're here because is
there's

1241
01:27:15,190 --> 01:27:18,219
a common things that bring you together
and that's great

1242
01:27:18,219 --> 01:27:21,260
and but at the same time it would be
cool to like you know

1243
01:27:21,260 --> 01:27:25,070
bring in different people have different
skills in different mindsets

1244
01:27:25,070 --> 01:27:29,469
I'll back to community a spaces

1245
01:27:29,469 --> 01:27:33,090
like safe spaces where people can have
these conversations because this is the

1246
01:27:33,090 --> 01:27:33,710
thing about

1247
01:27:33,710 --> 01:27:37,660
diversity and morning to increase for
people you actually have to have a space

1248
01:27:37,660 --> 01:27:38,450
right

1249
01:27:38,450 --> 01:27:42,080
like your new york it's a very
international city and the one thing

1250
01:27:42,080 --> 01:27:45,850
that I love about native New Yorkers is
that we talk about these issues

1251
01:27:45,850 --> 01:27:49,730
Lake directly out in the open and
sometimes those conversations can be

1252
01:27:49,730 --> 01:27:50,139
like

1253
01:27:50,139 --> 01:27:54,310
really uncomfortable but that's how you
make that's how you change things right

1254
01:27:54,310 --> 01:27:57,950
and the thing is like a lot of people
with culture talking about culture race

1255
01:27:57,950 --> 01:28:00,100
like the feeling comfortable talking
about it

1256
01:28:00,100 --> 01:28:04,670
but I think like everybody has to Lake
individually kinda overcome that and as

1257
01:28:04,670 --> 01:28:09,210
organizers were doing things provide a
safe space for these conversations can

1258
01:28:09,210 --> 01:28:10,300
take place

1259
01:28:10,300 --> 01:28:13,650
on anything I wanna at

1260
01:28:13,650 --> 01:28:17,650
I will leave some time for questions I'm
just gonna go on to the next slide

1261
01:28:17,650 --> 01:28:21,480
on this is some things like these are
possible solutions them to throw at you

1262
01:28:21,480 --> 01:28:22,750
are some possible Lake

1263
01:28:22,750 --> 01:28:26,050
just like some comments on like I
mentioned before

1264
01:28:26,050 --> 01:28:29,130
usually only the people that are factor
talking about these issues
