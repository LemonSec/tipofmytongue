1
00:00:01,660 --> 00:00:04,170
the there's a lot of people here

2
00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:10,690
there's a lot of people here okay

3
00:00:10,690 --> 00:00:14,179
I can see any people anymore so I feel
more comfortable arm

4
00:00:14,179 --> 00:00:17,880
walking the social engineering it's sad

5
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:24,480
the

6
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:27,189
we're running a bit late but you can
blame it what's known for that added to

7
00:00:27,189 --> 00:00:28,450
list things to blame for

8
00:00:28,450 --> 00:00:31,710
she got him on his pad

9
00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:35,410
arm okay I

10
00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:39,530
yes well I guess we should introduce
people you gonna literally true story I

11
00:00:39,530 --> 00:00:40,769
forgot my badge and I

12
00:00:40,769 --> 00:00:45,890
Social Engine my way into the room I
said I was on a panel and I they work

13
00:00:45,890 --> 00:00:49,600
mom's Choice are over there

14
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:56,600
I am urging Cheshire just a catalyst the
everybody my name's not Kevin

15
00:01:00,370 --> 00:01:03,860
have been doing this for a while member
knows the stalled in this is the first

16
00:01:03,860 --> 00:01:04,520
time

17
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:11,520
I'm burning yes and i'm new to this
whole thing I don't hun hell is going on

18
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:18,710
the

19
00:01:18,710 --> 00:01:23,159
I'm manual and I'm just so pissed on by
this whole thing you guys are awesome

20
00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:26,500
and %ah has chess so much fun as such a
trip

21
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:30,030
and i cant wait till two years go by a
Lee do something even better

22
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:37,030
the I don't know how we're going to sing
better but we'll figure

23
00:01:37,289 --> 00:01:41,539
up Kyle and I may be helping out a
little bit tonight

24
00:01:41,539 --> 00:01:45,310
with some the calls to make having fun

25
00:01:45,310 --> 00:01:49,929
has just so you know this the guy got as
the 10 gay

26
00:01:49,929 --> 00:01:54,679
connection everything the

27
00:01:54,679 --> 00:02:01,340
possibly five in behind a lot of
companies have helped balance about

28
00:02:01,340 --> 00:02:03,000
volunteers but I'm

29
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,520
is had visions their work there were
like can't take all the credit

30
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:10,030
at all but I I really really wanted this
for all of us

31
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:13,720
and it worked out really well for the
Aquino with a certain thing

32
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:16,910
use my band with people really I mean
come on Samarasinghe

33
00:02:16,910 --> 00:02:21,900
where you

34
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:25,799
I was recent Macys 15 minutes ago so all
this stuff is really confusing for me

35
00:02:25,799 --> 00:02:32,799
fiber-optic you know %ah

36
00:02:34,409 --> 00:02:37,459
from our history up here on this panel
really a wonderful

37
00:02:37,459 --> 00:02:41,769
love my face is in we can we can tell
stories on I want tells a couple stories

38
00:02:41,769 --> 00:02:43,220
I guess but we can also

39
00:02:43,220 --> 00:02:47,680
were found to Ronald which people prefer
yeah well you know I gotta say

40
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:52,290
I'm her putting this together and now
organizing the whole snowden thing in

41
00:02:52,290 --> 00:02:53,519
hand and dealing with

42
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:57,030
fire marshals and hotel bureaucracy
that's a nightmare for the real

43
00:02:57,030 --> 00:02:57,610
nightmare

44
00:02:57,610 --> 00:03:00,879
is trying to figure out what to come up
with here on this panel

45
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:04,379
sooo stressful I gotta think of
something clever as gotta work

46
00:03:04,379 --> 00:03:08,230
but you know on social engineering a big
parcels reengineering are things that

47
00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:11,579
don't work because I started to try to
get information and some money in some

48
00:03:11,579 --> 00:03:12,599
time to get busted

49
00:03:12,599 --> 00:03:16,920
and I it you have to learn how to react
to that had a I respond

50
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:21,629
when the jig is up so I hope we get some
success tonight an awesome fail you so

51
00:03:21,629 --> 00:03:22,670
weekends for a balanced

52
00:03:22,670 --> 00:03:26,459
to but when I would like to Tony social
engineering stories to get us

53
00:03:26,459 --> 00:03:30,069
can I started ok maybe some can define
social engineering

54
00:03:30,069 --> 00:03:37,069
in less than 20 minutes someone here
knows with his car

55
00:03:37,450 --> 00:03:42,829
how we doing up here I'm gonna tell a
story that I was involved in but

56
00:03:42,829 --> 00:03:43,930
whenever speakers

57
00:03:43,930 --> 00:03:47,769
this year I've remarked that he from a
Sydney

58
00:03:47,769 --> 00:03:51,160
came with a lot just really it's your
this year anyways giving it

59
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:54,510
I talk about a are north korea

60
00:03:54,510 --> 00:03:58,269
he he went into north korea four times
visited all four

61
00:03:58,269 --> 00:04:01,669
provinces with concealed electronic
equipment just

62
00:04:01,669 --> 00:04:05,650
to stop that we can all by but like you
know I the summit was a USB flash drive

63
00:04:05,650 --> 00:04:07,069
is a radio receiver that kinda thing

64
00:04:07,069 --> 00:04:12,079
any he sucked down over over-the-air
radio TV broadcast to a communications

65
00:04:12,079 --> 00:04:15,599
and brought back a wealth of amazing
stuff you're gonna just you just gonna

66
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:16,680
drop it but

67
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:20,289
have his talk is going in the other
social engineering he did

68
00:04:20,289 --> 00:04:23,360
to get in there and do this so this is

69
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:26,840
has applications that no could save his
life the people it

70
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:29,840
8 had been in a North Korean prison camp
right now so

71
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:33,160
is worth checking out this is gonna be
like another social engineering talk

72
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:34,120
tomorrow how to do that

73
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:38,000
4 o'clock tomorrow

74
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:45,000
right here

75
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:50,800
I'm plotting and scheming so you guys
tell some stories like pick up a phone

76
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:54,360
numbers

77
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:56,949
how to the social into new the 10 Google
Inc

78
00:04:56,949 --> 00:05:00,440
that's actually that's actually a really
really good question

79
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:03,490
um in it iOS app a couple and I think it
speaks to

80
00:05:03,490 --> 00:05:07,340
defining what social engineering is
because

81
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:11,940
I I think the foundation up what it is I
mean I'm not gonna say I am tax period

82
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:15,940
and I have like a 0 that academic
definition but I will

83
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:21,120
say in my mind it is a.m. base on a
foundation is establishing a reporter

84
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:25,009
and we do this all the time and
sometimes we a.m.

85
00:05:25,009 --> 00:05:28,319
sometimes we do it min frustrated ways

86
00:05:28,319 --> 00:05:32,360
I am if you've ever been pissed off
about something and called customer

87
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:35,699
whatever they call it and and and you

88
00:05:35,699 --> 00:05:41,590
wants the the charges said the changed
on your bill or whatever that may be

89
00:05:41,590 --> 00:05:47,120
arm if you're not in the right frame of
mind you might established the wrong

90
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:48,039
reporter

91
00:05:48,039 --> 00:05:52,780
but in the same in the same vein you can
establish really

92
00:05:52,780 --> 00:05:56,780
good report even if you are pissed off
but again you know your mood could

93
00:05:56,780 --> 00:06:00,139
could oil that to some degree

94
00:06:00,139 --> 00:06:03,979
so in my mind I think a social
engineering a lot is on the kinds of

95
00:06:03,979 --> 00:06:05,909
relationships and the kinds of

96
00:06:05,909 --> 00:06:11,180
mood you communicate in your phone call
the has a lot to do with intonation the

97
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:12,719
kinds of language you use

98
00:06:12,719 --> 00:06:18,430
the arm dynamics if your voice is being
sought by all those little subtleties

99
00:06:18,430 --> 00:06:21,570
arm a that that if you're

100
00:06:21,570 --> 00:06:25,770
on the native speaker even somebody who
speaks many languages do you really have

101
00:06:25,770 --> 00:06:26,710
mastered

102
00:06:26,710 --> 00:06:30,240
and it's also about empathy I am

103
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:34,319
and being able to listen like to really
hear someone

104
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:37,539
arm especially on the phone and not

105
00:06:37,539 --> 00:06:41,789
speaking so much about in person this
applies to when your face to face and

106
00:06:41,789 --> 00:06:44,909
and those kinds of interactions but
especially on the phone you really have

107
00:06:44,909 --> 00:06:45,610
to do

108
00:06:45,610 --> 00:06:49,770
good listening and lil listen for the
subtleties a

109
00:06:49,770 --> 00:06:53,360
what the person saying the other end so
it is about how you use your voice but

110
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:54,840
also how user listening

111
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:58,139
and and then you can directs

112
00:06:58,139 --> 00:07:02,150
all the other things you've mastered
with language to

113
00:07:02,150 --> 00:07:06,490
from to then communicate where your
where you're headed what what kinds of

114
00:07:06,490 --> 00:07:06,969
things

115
00:07:06,969 --> 00:07:10,050
you want or and how you want to direct
them

116
00:07:10,050 --> 00:07:13,669
using it as a former control I guess is
that

117
00:07:13,669 --> 00:07:20,400
to sinister coyote Ridge some point
control i think is one was important

118
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,089
words to think about and use winner

119
00:07:22,089 --> 00:07:25,820
defining social engineering as in you
know in psychology had the idea the

120
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:27,050
inner and the outer self

121
00:07:27,050 --> 00:07:30,919
and and that's how your your ourselves
gonna based on your inner self at a

122
00:07:30,919 --> 00:07:32,169
projector self in

123
00:07:32,169 --> 00:07:36,050
22 people and social engineering to talk
to real social engineer

124
00:07:36,050 --> 00:07:39,930
not me because I'm just lying right now
on I'm talking about they'll tell you

125
00:07:39,930 --> 00:07:40,580
that today

126
00:07:40,580 --> 00:07:44,130
the real power behind such engineering
is controlling that outer persona

127
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:47,560
using what you know internally and not
as how you subconsciously change the

128
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:48,289
inflection

129
00:07:48,289 --> 00:07:51,580
your voice the MTN talk about over the
phone

130
00:07:51,580 --> 00:07:55,909
the the ability for you to actually
controlled intonation flexion actually

131
00:07:55,909 --> 00:07:56,690
could convey

132
00:07:56,690 --> 00:08:00,529
a motion and that is how you control
conversation so we start thinking about

133
00:08:00,529 --> 00:08:04,919
responding to what someone is saying
sometimes anger is the appropriate way

134
00:08:04,919 --> 00:08:05,940
are sometimes

135
00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:09,960
very very lightness but it's about each
word and how you say it how u

136
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:13,839
inflict upon it you can actually start
driving people think about

137
00:08:13,839 --> 00:08:17,770
way our think about things in certain
ways that they don't realize you're

138
00:08:17,770 --> 00:08:18,710
forcing the do

139
00:08:18,710 --> 00:08:22,440
right you can be really like thrilled
and

140
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:26,339
and communicate the year angry and then
they may become

141
00:08:26,339 --> 00:08:30,169
empathetic here your situation and thus

142
00:08:30,169 --> 00:08:33,599
they are kinda disarmed in become
vulnerable to

143
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:38,209
whatever you're really trying to get
from them know the prisoners in the

144
00:08:38,209 --> 00:08:38,680
Finder

145
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:42,740
method acting you're really taking on a
persona that is your you and if you

146
00:08:42,740 --> 00:08:44,699
don't live that to the fullest T

147
00:08:44,699 --> 00:08:47,740
I mean if you're not walking in with
business cards with that fake name on it

148
00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:49,709
then you are not that persona

149
00:08:49,709 --> 00:08:53,329
so you really have to go just fall into
this and when you do that you give

150
00:08:53,329 --> 00:08:55,110
yourself over his other life

151
00:08:55,110 --> 00:08:59,600
you really gonna have the second major
way of convincing people to do things

152
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:00,110
they

153
00:09:00,110 --> 00:09:05,600
really really should be doing if we
could just give a formal definition of

154
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:06,649
social engineering

155
00:09:06,649 --> 00:09:10,000
its a confidence scheme

156
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,319
perpetrated most commonly over telephone
although

157
00:09:13,319 --> 00:09:19,079
not necessarily in order to gain the
trust of the target and get them to

158
00:09:19,079 --> 00:09:19,939
divulge

159
00:09:19,939 --> 00:09:24,199
information about you without knowing
that they've devoted

160
00:09:24,199 --> 00:09:27,589
it's pretty simple wat organizer

161
00:09:27,589 --> 00:09:31,080
that's fantastic okay I got something
here

162
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:35,170
on I read affirmation before but rather
than phone number

163
00:09:35,170 --> 00:09:38,779
on to at the I'd look it up have a car

164
00:09:38,779 --> 00:09:42,880

easy to get arm I figured maybe tonight

165
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:43,810
we have sorta

166
00:09:43,810 --> 00:09:50,810
I a couple themes revenge being one of
them I like revenge

167
00:09:51,550 --> 00:09:54,730
we found out over the past year or so
how much we've inspired

168
00:09:54,730 --> 00:09:57,850
on I think maybe it's time to turn the
tables little bit and try to find some

169
00:09:57,850 --> 00:09:59,850
information about the people who is
spying on us

170
00:09:59,850 --> 00:10:03,389
which it you know it's not that easy
obviously we're gonna pick time steps

171
00:10:03,389 --> 00:10:03,699
but

172
00:10:03,699 --> 00:10:06,940
maybe all the inspiration for people to
get more information

173
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:11,579
on finding out the phone number for the
national security agency is no easy task

174

214
00:13:14,550 --> 00:13:18,829
arm a public relations type number
corporate affairs

215
00:13:18,829 --> 00:13:23,280
your corporate affairs will shit like
that I'm gone are the days we just call

216
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:23,579
him

217
00:13:23,579 --> 00:13:27,760
operator I even at the NSA so are we
would like to do

218
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:31,470
is get a phone number or a name somebody
over there

219
00:13:31,470 --> 00:13:34,570
that we might be a call not expect is
really to work

220
00:13:34,570 --> 00:13:37,700
but we figured maybe we can use a little
confusion

221
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:40,730
on 2i to get information now

222
00:13:40,730 --> 00:13:44,890
NSA is in a place called Fort Meade
Maryland wonderful place

223
00:13:44,890 --> 00:13:48,029
and right next door

224
00:13:48,029 --> 00:13:51,070
to to the NSA is an army base

225
00:13:51,070 --> 00:13:53,800
as if they don't have enough scary
things they have an army base right next

226
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:54,170
door

227
00:13:54,170 --> 00:13:57,860
on and that's also known as Fort Meade

228
00:13:57,860 --> 00:14:02,070
and I imagine people get mixed up
sometimes

229
00:14:02,070 --> 00:14:05,560
and I when we went to the Bradley
Manning trial

230
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:09,300
that was in for me yes

231
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:12,400
therefore need that the army this I was
kinda

232
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:15,930
shell-shocked on so when I figures maybe

233
00:14:15,930 --> 00:14:18,940
maybe someone will pick up over their at
the

234
00:14:18,940 --> 00:14:23,329
I'm at the army base and then we can do
something kinda confusing

235
00:14:23,329 --> 00:14:26,720
to make it see my good looking for the
NSA without actually giving away the

236
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:28,779
information that that we're looking for
how

237
00:14:28,779 --> 00:14:32,930
have them help us on and I think I i
think im gonna try some

238
00:14:32,930 --> 00:14:37,339
but we can try out some voices here we
have fun have you seen the

239
00:14:37,339 --> 00:14:40,740
the 2600 waste management shirts the
ones the collars

240
00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:45,120
okay we serve came up with the whole
division 2600

241
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:50,270
with warehouse staff and I some guiding
what louise's name

243
00:14:53,470 --> 00:14:57,350
Kyle there's a pretty good impression
Louis how he sounds I have opposed as

244
00:14:57,350 --> 00:15:02,470
just anyone who is a native Louise those
natural resonator area in New York in

245
00:15:02,470 --> 00:15:05,530
general way this accident on the web
sites and is from I don't know what

246
00:15:05,530 --> 00:15:05,990
borough

247
00:15:05,990 --> 00:15:10,270
would be little raspy as may be loud but

248
00:15:10,270 --> 00:15:14,150
carriers 21 on

249
00:15:14,150 --> 00:15:18,579
say it's Louis waste management min

250
00:15:18,579 --> 00:15:21,959
there is a name other company waste
management 2600 waste management

251
00:15:21,959 --> 00:15:27,680

know about 2600 waste management than

252
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:28,560
here in the

253
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:31,870
shipping the that's good enough some
like that

254
00:15:31,870 --> 00:15:37,720
can we turn it down a little bit

255
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:44,240
so that's not quite as funny to the
people and this worry that they might be

256
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:45,079
laughing a lot

257
00:15:45,079 --> 00:15:50,390

had just wanna say happy birthday hope
remix

260
00:15:59,790 --> 00:16:03,790
partnership DBA service panel gonna a
yeah we got it on a dagger that's a

261
00:16:03,790 --> 00:16:04,620
little too

262
00:16:04,620 --> 00:16:07,640
funny then it's like to much of a
character

263
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:10,690
character you're gonna you know overdo
it gonna be

264
00:16:10,690 --> 00:16:13,760
somebody so funny sounding that they
know it's that

265
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:17,089
that your you want to try and sound may
be different than how you sound

266
00:16:17,089 --> 00:16:21,329
devices or maybe exactly how it sounded
they don't know your

267
00:16:21,329 --> 00:16:25,900
yellow this is early from 2600 waste
management

268
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:29,300
don't say that to them 0

269
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:33,270
cock you're going you're going to be you
can be somebody working at DHL

270
00:16:33,270 --> 00:16:36,410
and here's here's the premise of this
particular ruse

271
00:16:36,410 --> 00:16:41,030
we are calling on the army base and
hopefully reach a person

272
00:16:41,030 --> 00:16:44,240
I we may have to hit some buttons to
find a person I and we have a delivery

273
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:47,550
over 13 pallets a German energy drink
that's going

274
00:16:47,550 --> 00:16:52,689
to

275
00:16:52,689 --> 00:16:56,750
it's going to this place called national
security incorporated get the name wrong

276
00:16:56,750 --> 00:16:59,140
a little bit because an excellent more
believable

277
00:16:59,140 --> 00:17:02,510
we have an address that sorta rightists
ordered wrong

278
00:17:02,510 --> 00:17:05,699
and adds that my anchors for the help
you out a little bit are you mean those

279
00:17:05,699 --> 00:17:07,040
guys over there

280
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:10,970
here's their phone number I and I guess
we're gonna try and do is

281
00:17:10,970 --> 00:17:15,720
trying to contact name contact number on
otherwise is kinda go back to the port

282
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:17,319
can be sent back overseas

283
00:17:17,319 --> 00:17:20,470
you always put something kinda from
negative in there too

284
00:17:20,470 --> 00:17:24,730
to make them want to help you so let's
prevent this bad thing from happening

285
00:17:24,730 --> 00:17:27,929
and help us out and the NSA will be
happy and

286
00:17:27,929 --> 00:17:31,750
and hyped up on contact

287
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:35,539

I work or something else continuing the
at this hour

311
00:19:47,570 --> 00:19:50,590
are continuing the theme %uh revenge

312
00:19:50,590 --> 00:19:53,610
because from had better about a lot of
things

313
00:19:53,610 --> 00:19:58,039
you may have heard of a company called
source interlink

314
00:19:58,039 --> 00:20:01,429
have you yeah those are the distributors

315
00:20:01,429 --> 00:20:05,330
stacked I am decided to shut down and
leave us in the hall for a large amount

316
00:20:05,330 --> 00:20:05,710
of money

317
00:20:05,710 --> 00:20:10,309
i tempi can enthusiast on now it's
called the incident what they did was

318
00:20:10,309 --> 00:20:13,399
this is really kinda funny I source
interlink was the company

319
00:20:13,399 --> 00:20:16,750
on and they had two divisions

320
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:19,830
in the same office basically the same
address same same

321
00:20:19,830 --> 00:20:23,179
website everything on one was
distribution

322
00:20:23,179 --> 00:20:27,250
one was publishing these guys publish
Motor Trend magazine

323
00:20:27,250 --> 00:20:30,889
they publish stereo file they published
dozens of magazines

324
00:20:30,889 --> 00:20:35,389
I am one day decided now what this isn't
making money the distribution magazine

325
00:20:35,389 --> 00:20:35,809
so

326
00:20:35,809 --> 00:20:40,100
with its gonna close the doors they're
and do our work from the other half the

327
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:40,809
office

328
00:20:40,809 --> 00:20:44,610
and not pay any of our bills to all the
people that we all wanted him

329
00:20:44,610 --> 00:20:48,429
so I will call that number and you can
hear for yourself what they say are they

330
00:20:48,429 --> 00:20:55,429
a.m. explains adult can bring is a

331
00:20:55,940 --> 00:21:02,940
I during education picking a pretty
extension

332
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:07,490
these guys anytime I May 29

333
00:21:07,490 --> 00:21:11,620
2014 first announced that it is
discontinued

334
00:21:11,620 --> 00:21:15,149
domestic and international book &
magazine distribution

335
00:21:15,149 --> 00:21:18,919
operation as a result that worsening
financial condition

336
00:21:18,919 --> 00:21:24,250
democrat estimates major magazine
acquired and manufacturing division

337
00:21:24,250 --> 00:21:27,889
and RTAS X at the business remain happen

338
00:21:27,889 --> 00:21:32,100
and writing source is currently winding
up its operator

339
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:35,710
they basically had a great time at their
okay and thriving every heart attack

340
00:21:35,710 --> 00:21:38,049
attacks on some money transitioning to
new

341
00:21:38,049 --> 00:21:41,299
bone marrow cancer so is now I

342
00:21:41,299 --> 00:21:44,659
so our basically they're going with this
in a in a corporate way

343
00:21:44,659 --> 00:21:49,200
because a they split the company into
halves and 1/2 is proper 1/2

344
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:53,470
is not a bus they basically shut down
one to go bankrupt

345
00:21:53,470 --> 00:21:56,529
on have the corporation and they are
able to make profits

346
00:21:56,529 --> 00:22:00,470
with the other half without losing any
kind of van on

347
00:22:00,470 --> 00:22:03,679
II don't exactly know how it works I
just know that

348
00:22:03,679 --> 00:22:07,190
it's immoral and is wrong and were
pretty pissed off by that

349
00:22:07,190 --> 00:22:10,580
are so I just thought maybe this would
be a good time

350
00:22:10,580 --> 00:22:15,029
a good exercise %uh since they have some
a proper magazines like Motor Trend

351
00:22:15,029 --> 00:22:18,669

421
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:28,360
its what happens when your friendly and

425
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:45,680
you can get away with that CNN's

426
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:50,970
final decisions

427
00:27:50,970 --> 00:27:54,880
as a side the Cyber Command

428
00:27:54,880 --> 00:28:01,880

429
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:13,150
the religious people just handing us

we ask server command henry give wasn't
290

432
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:21,460
we think I'll it is a cyber

433
00:28:21,460 --> 00:28:26,760
well can we handle this can only happen

434
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:33,390

437
00:28:41,330 --> 00:28:45,620
dog from DHL freight services notes on
sooner

438
00:28:45,620 --> 00:28:48,960
Casey Lewis a guy we named at the at the
2600 warehouse

439
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:52,150
I by the we've made Louis the driver
because

440
00:28:52,150 --> 00:28:56,240
just it sounds better Louis the driver
too much like a caricature

441
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:59,320
yeah we want to keep the voice so we're
gonna be dark from DHL

442
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:02,380
right yes because they're the ones
delivering on commodity

443
00:29:02,380 --> 00:29:05,630
to genocide alright

444
00:29:05,630 --> 00:29:09,410

445
00:29:09,410 --> 00:29:13,120
the calling on behalf the driver who was
looking all day for this place

to be Blake and I have no idea where
loading dock or shipping anything is

655
00:44:33,880 --> 00:44:37,170
there's all kinds of fun you can have
anyone else yeah I'm a quick question

656
00:44:37,170 --> 00:44:41,279

in the Netherlands they dance on adult
