1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:03,149
high self my name's been run

2
00:00:03,149 --> 00:00:08,530
am I am an assistant professor at NYU
airlifted to fin de dotnet

3
00:00:08,530 --> 00:00:13,740
down but also you can email me I'm I
read a book about the history of spam

4
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:17,500
um feature you know you're hardly
encouraged to buy

5
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:20,810
but I just learned that another copy has
been uploaded to live Jan if you wanna

6
00:00:20,810 --> 00:00:22,119
go fishing instead

7
00:00:22,119 --> 00:00:25,320
um end to end yeah and I am

8
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:28,359
I am super nervous I'm currently working
on a book about

9
00:00:28,359 --> 00:00:32,399
obfuscation Helen Nissenbaum if he said
a new house targeted to touch a little

10
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:33,399
dance move those things

11
00:00:33,399 --> 00:00:36,790
and I'm researching a book about
additional cash and kept a currency's

12
00:00:36,790 --> 00:00:40,570
and I'm a huge money mirrored missus
proves this is me

13
00:00:40,570 --> 00:00:44,559
posing at the seder the Bretton Woods
monetary conference we actually

14
00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:48,239
adventure pictures inside the hotel but
they kicked us out after a while

15
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:53,399
a home so yeah you know if you go on to
redefine places where major money policy

16
00:00:53,399 --> 00:00:57,960
events happened I think that kinda
qualifies you for nerd credit um

17
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:01,510
and and hope is pretty much the best
conference that I at hand

18
00:01:01,510 --> 00:01:05,580
and I understand how brutally hi the
opportunity cost is for choosing one

19
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:08,310
thing over and over so I really
appreciate you giving me an hour

20
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:12,600
your precious hope time um and so we can
you get from this talk

21
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:16,360
ad for your sort of your you're our
attention especially given that like

22
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:21,500
you all have been prime for led world
historical significance CNN with me

23
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:25,259
ellsberg's moving and then we dig deep
dive into what I'm about to do

24
00:01:25,259 --> 00:01:29,579
so just brace yourselves um when I want
to kill you

25
00:01:29,579 --> 00:01:33,400
over the course of the next 45 minutes
or so are some big ideas

26
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:36,979
and the room to use them for the project
transforming money

27
00:01:36,979 --> 00:01:40,530
technologically as a way of transforming
society for the better

28
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:46,560
and my my sorted bona fides for that is
I'm actually mostly his story

29
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:49,590
I work in the history of science
technology especially things like

30
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:52,710
digital computation which is part of why
I love being here because this

31
00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:56,850
this place is a living tradition this is
a place that goes straight back to the

32
00:01:56,850 --> 00:01:57,540
Don

33
00:01:57,540 --> 00:02:01,610
above what we can think of this kind of
the 20th century radical use a fab

34
00:02:01,610 --> 00:02:04,509
technologies which is very sad very
exciting to be here and talk about the

35
00:02:04,509 --> 00:02:05,000
future

36
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:09,509
and when I want to suggest is that money
is something that you can and

37
00:02:09,509 --> 00:02:15,390
should hack on I want to say to certify
paraphrase Ted Nelson you can and must

38
00:02:15,390 --> 00:02:19,340
understand money matthau um and

39
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:23,010
and I want to suggest that we do this
not just by

40
00:02:23,010 --> 00:02:26,520
making contributions to all kinda
velopment or pitching in and building

41
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:29,040
better exchanges others are both good
things

42
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:33,870
very useful invaluable I'm going to talk
about what I really mean by

43
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:38,110
changing money by hacking on money in a
second now I wanna also have one quick

44
00:02:38,110 --> 00:02:39,349
practice here which is that

45
00:02:39,349 --> 00:02:43,450
I had this convo initial impulse I was
really nervous because this is hope this

46
00:02:43,450 --> 00:02:43,950
is like

47
00:02:43,950 --> 00:02:47,810
you know the best audience basically
ever so I thought I would give the

48
00:02:47,810 --> 00:02:51,550
like totally responsible talk that was
followed like careful points if

49
00:02:51,550 --> 00:02:52,569
historical reference

50
00:02:52,569 --> 00:02:55,530
a friend a min said your slides are
always really boring you should like

51
00:02:55,530 --> 00:02:59,010
start to jazz them up a little bit so as
I decided that for all the things that

52
00:02:59,010 --> 00:03:01,360
were said to me eighties it would kinda
look like crap

53
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:04,519
eighties eighty through the 80s to the
mid 90's are looking to

54
00:03:04,519 --> 00:03:08,950
analog synthesizers like fucking in
front of a needle printer suspect a

55
00:03:08,950 --> 00:03:12,489
into the lead nice greedy and anyway
a.m.

56
00:03:12,489 --> 00:03:16,290
its I was going to this really
responsible target was going to kinda

57
00:03:16,290 --> 00:03:18,800
like build on historical precedent and
talk about

58
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:23,590
R&D in cash cards and electronic purse
is in the nineteen nineties you're

59
00:03:23,590 --> 00:03:26,260
welcome to come up and talk to you about
that afterwards if you like it's an

60
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:27,940
amazing area history it's

61
00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:31,310
I'm incredibly understanding um and you
know

62
00:03:31,310 --> 00:03:35,610
early hash cash style cisterns and
lessons learned and all that sort of

63
00:03:35,610 --> 00:03:35,970
thing

64
00:03:35,970 --> 00:03:39,840
but then I realized like this is hope so
instead I'm just going to rant

65
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:43,099
and be completely irresponsible and hope
that no one that I work with this

66
00:03:43,099 --> 00:03:44,459
watching the live stream

67
00:03:44,459 --> 00:03:48,690
am enter and part of what I would like
to do

68
00:03:48,690 --> 00:03:52,040
is have forecast some future stuff a
little bit

69
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:56,370
and obviously telling the truth telling
the future are very different things I'm

70
00:03:56,370 --> 00:03:59,370
going to tell you a story about a place
that I think the future can go about a

71
00:03:59,370 --> 00:04:01,250
way that I think we can fork history

72
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:04,950
in a positive for in a positive
direction with the kinda technologies

73
00:04:04,950 --> 00:04:05,830
that we have available

74
00:04:05,830 --> 00:04:09,330
so let's start this off with a very big
bet

75
00:04:09,330 --> 00:04:15,439
I bet the next century plus

76
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:18,799
is going to have a recurring theme and
the recurring theme is going to be

77
00:04:18,799 --> 00:04:22,949
infrastructural struggles for autonomy

78
00:04:22,949 --> 00:04:27,600
infrastructural these events will have
profound consequences

79
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:31,740
but they will play out at levels well
below the visibility of a war or an

80
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:34,090
insurgency or an election

81
00:04:34,090 --> 00:04:38,139
they will be contested and fought in the
kind of domains that you think a

82
00:04:38,139 --> 00:04:41,840
when you think have on the move this
summer constantly wondering away from

83
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:44,110
the microphone

84
00:04:44,110 --> 00:04:47,550
there we go okay drain see a I did

85
00:04:47,550 --> 00:04:50,530
a when I'm up here in nervous I didn't
realize that it kinda sounded like a

86
00:04:50,530 --> 00:04:52,680
really bad cell phone call you know

87
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:57,000
quieter louder so some infrastructural
struggles for a time

88
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,470
infrastructural these are this means the
struggles are going to be played out in

89
00:05:00,470 --> 00:05:02,090
the places that you think when you think
I've

90
00:05:02,090 --> 00:05:05,419
phrases words like standards
architectures

91
00:05:05,419 --> 00:05:09,190
gateway spectrum interoperation airspace

92
00:05:09,190 --> 00:05:12,259
routes borders protocols logistics

93
00:05:12,259 --> 00:05:15,490
regulations chips licensing

94
00:05:15,490 --> 00:05:19,070
algorithm identification and
authentication property

95
00:05:19,070 --> 00:05:22,930
things like that and they will be
struggles

96
00:05:22,930 --> 00:05:27,120
easily play out anywhere on the spectrum
between disputes and war

97
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:30,240
the world will always be stricken

98
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:33,960
thank you get Getty Images looping

99
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:39,080
gifts which I didn't pay for and yes I
pronounce idk if I can come at me I

100
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:39,910
don't care

101
00:05:39,910 --> 00:05:43,720
a the struggles will play out

102
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:46,960
anywhere in the spectrum between
disputes in war because the world will

103
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:48,310
always be stricken with

104
00:05:48,310 --> 00:05:52,449
thugs bullies and tyrants and the
Quisling zine for Ceres and

105
00:05:52,449 --> 00:05:54,490
functionaries who do their bidding

106
00:05:54,490 --> 00:05:58,300
but now they're loath some work will be
taking place in the amazing technologies

107
00:05:58,300 --> 00:05:59,020
that we are

108
00:05:59,020 --> 00:06:02,240
starting to live with and helping to
build here just as it always has in the

109
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:07,130
exclusion zones the slave ships the star
chambers the supermax prisons

110
00:06:07,130 --> 00:06:10,870
and the cabinets wires they always have
throughout history

111
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:14,319
and we need to oppose them at the same
level and energy and inventiveness that

112
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:16,229
we have always brought to the table

113
00:06:16,229 --> 00:06:21,139
and finally autonomy the struggles will
be over many domains but I believe that

114
00:06:21,139 --> 00:06:23,930
likely an encompassing concern will be
autonomy

115
00:06:23,930 --> 00:06:27,699
self-governance Horizonte ality
decentralized and distributed systems

116
00:06:27,699 --> 00:06:29,870
processes and people

117
00:06:29,870 --> 00:06:33,039
things that can be deserted culated from
one of the handful

118
00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:37,110
major global historical dynamics the
last three-and-a-half centuries which is

119
00:06:37,110 --> 00:06:38,039
the steady

120
00:06:38,039 --> 00:06:42,470
escalating ratchet of consolidation and
centralize control

121
00:06:42,470 --> 00:06:46,000
we're right on the front lines at hope
but the number I've early forms abuse

122
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,740
infrastructural struggles and

123
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:51,340
we've heard many fascinating talks about
versions have them over the last two

124
00:06:51,340 --> 00:06:52,080
days

125
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:55,419
they're only going to get bigger and
crazier and more consequential

126
00:06:55,419 --> 00:06:59,099
these battles and yet they're going to
get more invisible harder to see

127
00:06:59,099 --> 00:07:03,229
and their former urgently requiring our
explanation and advocacy as well as as

128
00:07:03,229 --> 00:07:04,410
technical additions

129
00:07:04,410 --> 00:07:08,319
from here on out and I believe that
money will be one of the five or six

130
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:09,720
primary theaters

131
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:13,509
in which this 21st century struggle is
going to happen

132
00:07:13,509 --> 00:07:19,150
so what the hell is money

133
00:07:19,150 --> 00:07:22,400
money is a puzzle first first and
foremost

134
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:27,640
their fossils a beautiful in their
hostels in the beautiful limestone and

135
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:29,440
the PSN za mountains in Italy

136
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:33,140
the shells and creatures from teeming
masses Alexys

137
00:07:33,140 --> 00:07:36,620
interred in the bare rocks at the
highest peaks on the mountain range

138
00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:40,620
how did they come ass Leonardo da Vinci
to be up so high

139
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:44,700
their calorie shells huge piles carry
shells

140
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:48,710
in the area regions a West Africa
thousands of miles from the Indian Ocean

141
00:07:48,710 --> 00:07:50,100
with the sea snails lived

142
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:53,360
we can ask with Devyn she are we to
believe that the flood

143
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:57,270
reached so far a course the Carrie
shells

144
00:07:57,270 --> 00:08:01,190
which appear here in a radical from
ancient Chinese which gradually

145
00:08:01,190 --> 00:08:04,120
transforms into the current classical
Chinese symbol for money

146
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:08,030
these fossils these carry shells um

147
00:08:08,030 --> 00:08:11,950
turnout fossils carry shells removed by
force even more powerful in some ways

148
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:13,900
the geology the force a trade

149
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:18,090
things being token as money it to be
more exact carry shelter one of the

150
00:08:18,090 --> 00:08:19,680
things that oil the operation

151
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:25,220
the terrible machine at the West African
slave trade so it carries shells can be

152
00:08:25,220 --> 00:08:27,820
money then where do we draw the line
where does it end

153
00:08:27,820 --> 00:08:30,880
this is the great Martin Hsu back me
love this because this seems like a

154
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:32,240
classic kind of like

155
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:37,250
trippy mane he is like high phiri
abstract thing you know there is no

156
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:38,830
basis money is whatever

157
00:08:38,830 --> 00:08:42,130
but but should pick is not some kind of
trippy guy

158
00:08:42,130 --> 00:08:45,770
issue because the guy who wrote theory
of money in financial institutions he's

159
00:08:45,770 --> 00:08:49,250
one of the great monetary theory is that
the 20th century he's a game theory dude

160
00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:50,850
she's actually really into computers

161
00:08:50,850 --> 00:08:55,060
and this was the best he could do and i
think is very accurate

162
00:08:55,060 --> 00:08:58,290
and the rules of the game a really
complicated man who gets to make those

163
00:08:58,290 --> 00:09:00,130
rules is enormously important

164
00:09:00,130 --> 00:09:04,730
because let's go back to carry shells
when she'd actually use them in trade it

165
00:09:04,730 --> 00:09:08,170
so you could actually do anything with
them aside from make jury

166
00:09:08,170 --> 00:09:11,190
but as it turns out jury really matters

167
00:09:11,190 --> 00:09:15,100
jewelry does social signaling it
signifies prestige

168
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:19,170
sharing it or giving it are demanding
its men's bonds in relationships and

169
00:09:19,170 --> 00:09:21,190
alliances and admits group together

170
00:09:21,190 --> 00:09:24,720
jewelry is a high bandwidth
communications system

171
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:29,070
and maybe we can think I've carry shell
jewelry has been kinda like a terrific

172
00:09:29,070 --> 00:09:30,440
Google query ranking

173
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:34,380
I mean model of the various problems a
kukri rankings but when you google

174
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:37,340
something the first thing that comes up
that's a powerful symbol that's who

175
00:09:37,340 --> 00:09:40,770
comes first that's what really matters
that's the most important thing for the

176
00:09:40,770 --> 00:09:43,250
vast majority of people who only look at
the first three results

177
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:47,130
now Carrizales a kind of like that you
see who has the most when you go into

178
00:09:47,130 --> 00:09:50,260
space you know you need to talk to you
really need to ask the reserve

179
00:09:50,260 --> 00:09:53,950
accept these are also unlike a many
Google search query rankings

180
00:09:53,950 --> 00:09:56,930
these are negotiable these are liquid
you can give them to your friends and

181
00:09:56,930 --> 00:10:00,160
cronies you can move influence and power
around

182
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:04,090
you can do business from the Maldives to
Timbuktu to the trade bazaars a western

183
00:10:04,090 --> 00:10:04,640
China

184
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:08,690
and of course that means that these are
also about moving power

185
00:10:08,690 --> 00:10:12,130
around notice I love these words like
status and prestige

186
00:10:12,130 --> 00:10:16,330
and of course leaves the property of
money missus shaped by the rules of the

187
00:10:16,330 --> 00:10:16,990
game

188
00:10:16,990 --> 00:10:21,020
and making the rules have money lets you
restructure society itself in a very

189
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:22,190
fundamental level

190
00:10:22,190 --> 00:10:27,330
the rules have money can help to enforce
and build on existing social and

191
00:10:27,330 --> 00:10:28,380
political structures

192
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:32,160
where they can undermine them and we can
see these powers with extra clarity

193
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:35,660
when we see whatever passes for
conventional money run low

194
00:10:35,660 --> 00:10:39,280
or run out data home so

195
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:42,370
take the Knights Hospitaller us the
Knights of Malta

196
00:10:42,370 --> 00:10:45,910
could receive the privilege a mintage
the right to strike

197
00:10:45,910 --> 00:10:49,780
claim to function is tender and we'll
come back to that privilege in how you

198
00:10:49,780 --> 00:10:51,020
get and what it means

199
00:10:51,020 --> 00:10:55,680
in the fifteen thirties they were put
under siege by the Ottoman Empire

200
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:58,680
this is a depiction of them on the
island I really like for cartography

201
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:02,630
geeks out there like at this projection
works to Sir gang everything together

202
00:11:02,630 --> 00:11:05,850
they were under siege by the Ottoman
Empire was an extraordinarily brutal

203
00:11:05,850 --> 00:11:09,100
siege even make early modern standards
people shot this

204
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:13,010
yeah decapitated heads and Turk said
cannons the turks with dead people and

205
00:11:13,010 --> 00:11:15,220
crucifixes in floated them out to sea

206
00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:18,850
the maid said torched all the crops
before they retreated into the fortress

207
00:11:18,850 --> 00:11:20,440
the poison all the wells

208
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:23,510
and then the turks left the siege broke

209
00:11:23,510 --> 00:11:27,840
now mates had a problem because they
were sitting on a rock

210
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:32,640
with completely annihilated cities and
towns and shattered fortress says

211
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:36,820
animals no access to resources and
wealth that they had filled with the mix

212
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:40,260
and this when I favorite little details
up dead animals

213
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:43,260
hemp fun girly disease tweet him arsenic

214
00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:47,550
to make sure that the church can
successfully extract water from it

215
00:11:47,550 --> 00:11:52,400
they were in the smelling yummy yum yes
yeah

216
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:56,089
the old Clemente also has you know God
knows how to remake a team in there

217
00:11:56,089 --> 00:11:56,760
somewhere

218
00:11:56,760 --> 00:12:00,370
a.m. yes the first

219
00:12:00,370 --> 00:12:03,270
so they were on this there in this
disaster zone and they knew that the

220
00:12:03,270 --> 00:12:06,209
Ottomans were actually coming back

221
00:12:06,209 --> 00:12:09,670
they had very very little in the way of
money they'd run outta bullion how did

222
00:12:09,670 --> 00:12:11,890
the precious metals that they could mean
coins from

223
00:12:11,890 --> 00:12:15,080
you think being sacred nights with the
backing up the pope they could just

224
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:19,200
order people around but even in the
early modern period there was no dice

225
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:23,110
so the incident had been credible they
took the privilege to make money

226
00:12:23,110 --> 00:12:26,580
and they started striking these coins
made of copper

227
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:30,430
with the device a handshake and the
Insignia the you can see around the rim

228
00:12:30,430 --> 00:12:30,940
their

229
00:12:30,940 --> 00:12:34,080
non as: said fetus not the copper

230
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:37,339
or not the metal but the trust

231
00:12:37,339 --> 00:12:41,500
these coins are traded on trust that's
sort of what they do you notice also the

232
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:44,430
date is way later the commission is
claims for a long time this is just the

233
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:47,100
highest resolution image I could find a
month

234
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:50,110
this issue these coins came with the
promise that the queen is could be

235
00:12:50,110 --> 00:12:53,720
redeemed in silver once the Knights were
back on their feet

236
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:56,790
so they would buy with the coins in the
value of silver to get the stuff we

237
00:12:56,790 --> 00:12:59,750
needed to rebuild the cities in the
fortresses and get the cannons and all

238
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:00,580
the rest at

239
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:03,910
and then eventually be able to redeem it
once everything worked out

240
00:13:03,910 --> 00:13:07,410
and it worked the actually you can
rebuild the whole city on trust if you

241
00:13:07,410 --> 00:13:08,470
have enough trust

242
00:13:08,470 --> 00:13:11,570
a course it helps to be legendary
religious war heroes and have your own

243
00:13:11,570 --> 00:13:13,270
island but but still

244
00:13:13,270 --> 00:13:18,470
the starting point or take the Irish
banking straight moving closer to the

245
00:13:18,470 --> 00:13:20,330
present day of nineteen seventy

246
00:13:20,330 --> 00:13:23,760
the banks went on strike in the first
half may and they didn't reopen until

247
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:25,950
mid-november

248
00:13:25,950 --> 00:13:30,310
so think about this all the banks close
you can't deposit checks

249
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:34,350
you can't get money out no one can do
anything financial this is the year

250
00:13:34,350 --> 00:13:37,900
before ATM's but even so the teams would
have been restocked after a limited

251
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:39,480
period in any case

252
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:43,270
there is some advance warning some
people had some time to stockpile cash

253
00:13:43,270 --> 00:13:46,490
but within a few weeks the supply
already begun to run low

254
00:13:46,490 --> 00:13:50,180
employers were cutting deals with retail
stores and churches to get their hands

255
00:13:50,180 --> 00:13:51,010
on another

256
00:13:51,010 --> 00:13:54,160
rectors churches have liked I've you
know typing and

257
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:57,320
yet poor boxes name a lot of cash around
so

258
00:13:57,320 --> 00:14:01,290
had to get enough ready money to pay
wages and as I'm sure you know

259
00:14:01,290 --> 00:14:05,050
and things shortly afterwards collapsed
into lawlessness with roving gangs have

260
00:14:05,050 --> 00:14:06,600
new wave cannibals

261
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:11,120
and post-apocalyptic thundered ounce

262
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:14,670
or not or not actually

263
00:14:14,670 --> 00:14:18,000
yeah that's basically accurate this is
just outside of Dublin

264
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:22,120
I'm a.m.

265
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:25,930
the

266
00:14:25,930 --> 00:14:28,940
admittedly but but bearing bearing in
mind the money issue

267
00:14:28,940 --> 00:14:33,120
a.m. because instead people started
using their checkbooks

268
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:36,370
they'd write checks for what they needed
and with in smaller communities the

269
00:14:36,370 --> 00:14:39,900
checks themselves started to become a
Canon ago Chabal paper backed by the

270
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:41,160
social graph

271
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:44,810
individuals families and businesses all
kept their own ledgers

272
00:14:44,810 --> 00:14:48,110
these are the checks I'm holding from
others so that's kinda roughly what I

273
00:14:48,110 --> 00:14:51,610
have to work within these are the checks
they have out to everyone else

274
00:14:51,610 --> 00:14:54,970
in less tight-knit environments League
neighborhoods and cities

275
00:14:54,970 --> 00:14:58,970
the reservoir of trust became the local
pub if someone was trying to float a

276
00:14:58,970 --> 00:15:00,200
substantial check

277
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:03,290
you go in and ask the bartender at their
local whether they were in acceptable

278
00:15:03,290 --> 00:15:04,820
credit risk

279
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:07,839
the person is chronicled most at this
economic history

280
00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:12,780
and phrased it this way love it when
economists make jokes

281
00:15:12,780 --> 00:15:15,910
because bartenders could be trusted in a
way that

282
00:15:15,910 --> 00:15:18,950
it with may be very difficult for other
other kinds of fair

283
00:15:18,950 --> 00:15:22,630
back in am enter

284
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:25,660
as the blank checks started to run out
people the end to make their

285
00:15:25,660 --> 00:15:29,720
own wonderfully elaborate I O use with
their banking information on it

286
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:33,680
countersigned by neighbors and friends
and relatives

287
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:37,100
the straight did eventually and of
course and it took the bags months to

288
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:40,510
reconcile the intricate layers of
transactions can you couldn't just go

289
00:15:40,510 --> 00:15:43,280
through all the checks in one person's
hands

290
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:46,970
because then they were meaning on other
people's checks there this whole house

291
00:15:46,970 --> 00:15:48,089
of cards

292
00:15:48,089 --> 00:15:52,449
um person he had issued against person
be who issued against person see

293
00:15:52,449 --> 00:15:56,640
but nonetheless there was astonishingly
little fraud like shockingly little

294
00:15:56,640 --> 00:16:01,270
much less than you would expect a course
this was in a blissful utopia mutual aid

295
00:16:01,270 --> 00:16:02,220
and Social Credit

296
00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:05,620
as you can imagine if you had any need
for imports are foreign exchange were

297
00:16:05,620 --> 00:16:07,319
pretty well screwed

298
00:16:07,319 --> 00:16:10,110
and of course all this did lean on the
fact that the banks would in fact

299
00:16:10,110 --> 00:16:12,030
eventually reopen

300
00:16:12,030 --> 00:16:16,140
between astonishing degree this system
and moving Social Credit around worked

301
00:16:16,140 --> 00:16:18,199
indeed the economy actually grew a bit

302
00:16:18,199 --> 00:16:21,260
so to oversimplify within a few months
you were drying

303
00:16:21,260 --> 00:16:25,850
assets that were backed by government
issued notes by the social resiliency in

304
00:16:25,850 --> 00:16:30,040
internal trust to the tight-knit
community of which you are a part

305
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:34,230
a reputation con economy essentially so
we have tons of examples are things like

306
00:16:34,230 --> 00:16:37,949
this and related systems that you can
buy into because the work for you

307
00:16:37,949 --> 00:16:41,319
and you believe in them money is a
former allegiance

308
00:16:41,319 --> 00:16:45,079
means we're gonna start circling back to
curb the currency's so what do you have

309
00:16:45,079 --> 00:16:46,420
an allegiance to

310
00:16:46,420 --> 00:16:50,230
well maybe it's the local economy of the
colonies and eventually the notes issued

311
00:16:50,230 --> 00:16:52,819
by the Revolutionary Government of the
United States

312
00:16:52,819 --> 00:16:56,180
these are printed by benjamin Franklin I
love his little if you see over there in

313
00:16:56,180 --> 00:16:57,630
the note on your right

314
00:16:57,630 --> 00:17:01,620
the counterfeit is death in them she
cast metal

315
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:04,640
gothic font there a.m.

316
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:07,740
but also known as the leaf spring I just
wanna point this light will be given an

317
00:17:07,740 --> 00:17:09,980
amazing badass Franklin could be

318
00:17:09,980 --> 00:17:13,339
he had done these these books for
British naturalist who had wandered

319
00:17:13,339 --> 00:17:14,040
around in

320
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:17,209
in America getting leaf prints and
Benjamin had

321
00:17:17,209 --> 00:17:22,100
had figured out how to print believes
against plaster cast metal against that

322
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:25,910
and you soon realize with a second these
leaves a really easy for me to print the

323
00:17:25,910 --> 00:17:29,580
really hard for people to reproduce by
hand if they're trying to engrave their

324
00:17:29,580 --> 00:17:32,050
own plates to counterfeit this money

325
00:17:32,050 --> 00:17:36,160
he discovered something like the PNP
problem of stuff

326
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:41,730
you pound okay abusing something that
was easy to verify but very hard to fake

327
00:17:41,730 --> 00:17:45,880
anything Franklin was pretty amazing um
but yes I mean you have an allegiance to

328
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:50,740
these new colonies and their weird half
ass system of money would leave sign in

329
00:17:50,740 --> 00:17:54,390
or maybe you have an allegiance to the
Limerick soviet where you actually being

330
00:17:54,390 --> 00:17:55,490
issued monthly

331
00:17:55,490 --> 00:17:58,870
in which you are being promised by the
workers in Limerick

332
00:17:58,870 --> 00:18:02,670
I'm it only lasted for a few months or
maybe you have an allegiance to the idea

333
00:18:02,670 --> 00:18:03,990
that human time

334
00:18:03,990 --> 00:18:09,160
is the only really valuable commodity in
which case you very likely held notes

335
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:13,290
from use I A warren's time store in
Cincinnati in the eighteen twenties this

336
00:18:13,290 --> 00:18:14,910
is an incredible project

337
00:18:14,910 --> 00:18:18,550
which really did attempted to nominate
the value of everything in the time

338
00:18:18,550 --> 00:18:23,059
a skilled person would spend on it so
whose skill warring debated from even to

339
00:18:23,059 --> 00:18:26,990
settle and carpenters which is why the
benchmark for value here

340
00:18:26,990 --> 00:18:30,200
is hours a skilled carpenter can work
and corn

341
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:34,620
the Civic busily be major said modes and
Exchange ability

342
00:18:34,620 --> 00:18:38,410
or maybe it's the anarchist economics
have celia the cell

343
00:18:38,410 --> 00:18:41,930
who wanted to build local dimmer Ridge
currencies which is to say currencies

344
00:18:41,930 --> 00:18:44,240
that actually lose value with time

345
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:48,510
deliberately to put people who hold
money on the same footing as people who

346
00:18:48,510 --> 00:18:52,890
hold things like food or crops are other
things a container roster radical

347
00:18:52,890 --> 00:18:56,020
rust or rot or go away um but

348
00:18:56,020 --> 00:19:00,450
I love this so much because this is this
is the flip side wanna decelles

349
00:19:00,450 --> 00:19:03,770
Fridell notes this is money that has its
own man page

350
00:19:03,770 --> 00:19:07,220
this issue any that has its own
instructions for use a manifesto

351
00:19:07,220 --> 00:19:09,500
explaining why you should be using it

352
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:13,250
which is pretty awesome and needless to
say because this is so wonderfully geeky

353
00:19:13,250 --> 00:19:17,309
match live is a crypto currency version
now to fry claim with an incredibly

354
00:19:17,309 --> 00:19:19,170
elaborate system a related things

355
00:19:19,170 --> 00:19:22,640
if there's a Franklin person here please
come talk to me I love you guys who are

356
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:24,820
so amazing

357
00:19:24,820 --> 00:19:27,620
or maybe hell let's look at something
that doesn't even look like money as we

358
00:19:27,620 --> 00:19:29,420
recognize it

359
00:19:29,420 --> 00:19:33,720
maybe it's something like tally sticks a
physical database me don't have wood

360
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:36,790
that lets you keep track of who has
rights to which

361
00:19:36,790 --> 00:19:41,190
how on a particular out to this is a
Swiss setup tally sticks here in like it

362
00:19:41,190 --> 00:19:42,080
says at the bottom

363
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:46,920
this really does cue track and 87 house
among twenty three different people

364
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:50,590
um the beauty of it is that you can
actually make these out of wood carved

365
00:19:50,590 --> 00:19:54,050
them in certain ways split them so that
it's impossible for me to change there's

366
00:19:54,050 --> 00:19:55,380
without changing the other

367
00:19:55,380 --> 00:19:58,620
because the way to identify the
difference and don't necessarily laugh

368
00:19:58,620 --> 00:20:00,340
at this as a as a mechanism

369
00:20:00,340 --> 00:20:05,210
the entire financial architecture a
Briton for centuries was built on tally

370
00:20:05,210 --> 00:20:09,580
sticks issued by the Exchequer made from
the Willows that grew by the Thames

371
00:20:09,580 --> 00:20:13,230
they did big money with this stuff you
know money you owed to the key many the

372
00:20:13,230 --> 00:20:17,020
King owed to you the bearings gambling
land away et cetera et cetera et cetera

373
00:20:17,020 --> 00:20:19,550
they don't get the prominence they
deserve because when they decided to

374
00:20:19,550 --> 00:20:22,420
modernize the financial system the burn
them

375
00:20:22,420 --> 00:20:25,170
because you know who wants to have these
embarrassing relics Lansley destroyed

376
00:20:25,170 --> 00:20:26,940
this beautiful well the financial
history

377
00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:30,170
and also overheated the chimney in
Birmingham Parliament

378
00:20:30,170 --> 00:20:33,550
a which didn't turn out so

379
00:20:33,550 --> 00:20:37,780
to have a little Jason Scott interlude
here this is for the proof don't fucking

380
00:20:37,780 --> 00:20:39,030
throw things away

381
00:20:39,030 --> 00:20:42,870
don't needlessly destroy things you need
to destroy you can never tell when

382
00:20:42,870 --> 00:20:44,530
you're trying to let you know

383
00:20:44,530 --> 00:20:47,870
scrub all those old hard drives the
American League de Taos

384
00:20:47,870 --> 00:20:51,380
everything who knows a.m. this is all to
say

385
00:20:51,380 --> 00:20:54,960
money is a significant part have led
Benedict Anderson a great political

386
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:55,760
theorist called

387
00:20:55,760 --> 00:21:00,160
imagined communities the way we feel
that we belong in a deep sense

388
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:04,309
two groups countries Nations peoples who
will never entirely know who may not

389
00:21:04,309 --> 00:21:04,910
even have

390
00:21:04,910 --> 00:21:09,580
territory or formal structure money is a
way that we can sort of vote

391
00:21:09,580 --> 00:21:13,530
that we can allow ourselves to things
but of course we all do this we'll show

392
00:21:13,530 --> 00:21:15,960
which allegiances we have

393
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:19,090
everyone in this room is probably done
multiple transactions

394
00:21:19,090 --> 00:21:23,890
in United States Federal Reserve notes
today and those are based on trust to

395
00:21:23,890 --> 00:21:27,620
both that we trust that the notes were
accepting them passing on counterfeit

396
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:30,860
and in a deeper sense the Federal
Reserve will not print too much money at

397
00:21:30,860 --> 00:21:31,350
once

398
00:21:31,350 --> 00:21:35,790
and thereby render what we hold valuable
or not less valuable even worthless

399
00:21:35,790 --> 00:21:38,870
and this course requires backing in
multiple forms this is a very brief

400
00:21:38,870 --> 00:21:39,860
interlude but

401
00:21:39,860 --> 00:21:43,350
I couldn't resist confidence in money is
so fascinating

402
00:21:43,350 --> 00:21:46,800
because to mean that money is not easily
counterfeited they have to put an

403
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:50,120
amazing amount or technological thought
into the architecture

404
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:54,380
physical currency am ranging from
reading systems which

405
00:21:54,380 --> 00:21:57,300
no longer really serve this purpose
because in a lot of value in the medal

406
00:21:57,300 --> 00:21:59,179
in claims but back in the old days

407
00:21:59,179 --> 00:22:03,800
the designs you couldn't trim the edges
have the coins of a very sharp knife to

408
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:06,429
get the little fine filings have silver

409
00:22:06,429 --> 00:22:09,950
while still letting the Queen keep its
initial face value

410
00:22:09,950 --> 00:22:13,000
and see other had a widely implement the
city could really see when you're

411
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,100
starting to scrape stuff away

412
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:18,880
Isaac Newton had people drawn and
quartered for doing things like this

413
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:23,200
a.m. compete is used to be a way more
barbaric field than it is now

414
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:27,140
the sheer amount of technology that goes
into securing a single node is an

415
00:22:27,140 --> 00:22:29,100
absolutely extraordinary thing

416
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:32,790
and forget about like the thermal
reactive eames in the security threads

417
00:22:32,790 --> 00:22:33,740
another estimate

418
00:22:33,740 --> 00:22:36,390
let's talk about one of my personal
favorite things to do but remember

419
00:22:36,390 --> 00:22:38,440
you're familiar with because this is
hope

420
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:41,960
which is some when you look at a US$20

421
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:45,500
notice the little yellow twenties that
are scattered around in a cloud on one

422
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:46,550
corner in the bill

423
00:22:46,550 --> 00:22:50,130
and the notice the Olweus in that cloud
which fall into

424
00:22:50,130 --> 00:22:53,250
an arrangement called the you Ryan
constellation

425
00:22:53,250 --> 00:22:56,710
which is the subjective a collective
agreement among a

426
00:22:56,710 --> 00:23:00,040
quite a lot of different currency issue
in countries in central banks and means

427
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:04,179
and also the people who work in the
firmware for color photocopy machines

428
00:23:04,179 --> 00:23:07,400
that's something that has the you're I
am constellation and it will not let

429
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:10,179
itself be scanned or photocopied

430
00:23:10,179 --> 00:23:13,980
it will not generate a page as a result
it that it is identifiable the

431
00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:16,860
you should look into the patents risk
the Pens are fascinating they're very

432
00:23:16,860 --> 00:23:17,790
thoughtful

433
00:23:17,790 --> 00:23:21,410
and this is kinda real world version at
the William Gibson sci fi di ABI

434
00:23:21,410 --> 00:23:25,260
ugliest t-shirt in the world but it
should be exempts whoever is wearing it

435
00:23:25,260 --> 00:23:26,960
from being able to be digitally

436
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:30,920
captured but it goes it goes even beyond
that

437
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:34,660
in other ways there's really incredible
research going on right now

438
00:23:34,660 --> 00:23:38,300
into trying to figure cuz it's not just
the Orion constellation this fascinating

439
00:23:38,300 --> 00:23:40,710
we're going to trying to figure out what
it is that is

440
00:23:40,710 --> 00:23:44,750
in money that makes it so that things
like Adobe Photoshop can recognizing

441
00:23:44,750 --> 00:23:46,520
your attempting to scan and note

442
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:50,120
in or make changes to bank notes from
particular countries

443
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:53,670
people are trying to break down
precisely how that works um

444
00:23:53,670 --> 00:23:57,230
yet the policing a images have notes
again to maintain confidence in the

445
00:23:57,230 --> 00:23:57,800
currency

446
00:23:57,800 --> 00:24:01,179
is an extraordinary project you have to
write to this dude

447
00:24:01,179 --> 00:24:05,220
a in order to get high resolution images
a bank notes that you can do things that

448
00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:07,010
have to make the case to this guy

449
00:24:07,010 --> 00:24:10,020
and sent a letter to his office which is
just delightful to me

450
00:24:10,020 --> 00:24:13,559
am but then there's the question of
course is long-term value and we're

451
00:24:13,559 --> 00:24:16,050
gonna circle back to that in a second
match is the question whether that

452
00:24:16,050 --> 00:24:19,200
whatever your holdings counterfeit or
not but the question how valuable it's

453
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:21,110
going to be in the long term

454
00:24:21,110 --> 00:24:24,460
let's stay with the question of trust
because document trust means taking had

455
00:24:24,460 --> 00:24:27,210
the privilege to mint and specify
currency

456
00:24:27,210 --> 00:24:30,630
and that's the second most important
privilege above the sovereign where the

457
00:24:30,630 --> 00:24:31,720
sovereign nation

458
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:35,039
and that's part of why could occurrences
are so important

459
00:24:35,039 --> 00:24:38,700
because it turns out being able to
specify currency in min currency is a

460
00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:41,919
great way to get people to do what you
want

461
00:24:41,919 --> 00:24:45,140
let's say you want to conquer the world

462
00:24:45,140 --> 00:24:49,190
you need an army and then army is going
have a lot of foreign mercenaries Senate

463
00:24:49,190 --> 00:24:52,880
and these foreign mercenaries and I can
be cool with some kind of magic

464
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:56,510
Social Credit Scheme where you have to
go talk to a bartender and look at

465
00:24:56,510 --> 00:25:00,179
someones get have stats and you get a
special coupon lets you have two hours

466
00:25:00,179 --> 00:25:01,029
and carpentry

467
00:25:01,029 --> 00:25:04,090
I'm they want cash

468
00:25:04,090 --> 00:25:07,580
the one cash that they can spend in
their home countries so now you have two

469
00:25:07,580 --> 00:25:11,120
problems you need to get cash for them
and you need to make that cash good

470
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:12,460
wherever they travel

471
00:25:12,460 --> 00:25:15,640
so if you're alexander the Great who
faced exactly these problems

472
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:18,799
you realize rather some very smart
people who work for you realize

473
00:25:18,799 --> 00:25:22,120
that each problem is actually the
solution to the other problem

474
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:26,649
as the sovereign you can order the issue
of coin in silver is soldiers wages

475
00:25:26,649 --> 00:25:30,740
and then as your soldiers conquer you
can demand payment of taxes and

476
00:25:30,740 --> 00:25:32,289
grandsons and tributes

477
00:25:32,289 --> 00:25:35,620
in your currency so you created instant
demand

478
00:25:35,620 --> 00:25:38,519
suddenly everyone would really like to
get their hands on some so they can pay

479
00:25:38,519 --> 00:25:41,010
their taxes and not get killed

480
00:25:41,010 --> 00:25:44,649
and of course war is also a terrific
sources slaves which is what you need to

481
00:25:44,649 --> 00:25:48,559
work the silver mines in acetone and
tragic in booty like the hordes a

482
00:25:48,559 --> 00:25:49,929
bullion from the Persians

483
00:25:49,929 --> 00:25:54,500
so singing at this and seem proto
military-industrial complex going

484
00:25:54,500 --> 00:25:58,820
where the demand for soldiers pay stoked
the fires up on my locker enslaved

485
00:25:58,820 --> 00:26:02,250
miners in the expansion at the Imperial
tax base

486
00:26:02,250 --> 00:26:05,140
it turns out to be like drinking
seawater the more you have the more you

487
00:26:05,140 --> 00:26:06,429
need

488
00:26:06,429 --> 00:26:10,289
now the thing is as monstrous is this
plan years ago actually kinda work okay

489
00:26:10,289 --> 00:26:11,529
but let's see it doesn't

490
00:26:11,529 --> 00:26:16,000
some battles fall through the Sun is in
your eyes you know who gives a shit

491
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:20,750
something goes wrong with your amazing
plan economy to make a lot more money

492
00:26:20,750 --> 00:26:24,059
ancient Rome is where we get the term
money

493
00:26:24,059 --> 00:26:27,649
ok

494
00:26:27,649 --> 00:26:30,610
engine room is actually where we get the
term money from the temple a jew

495
00:26:30,610 --> 00:26:31,309
nominator

496
00:26:31,309 --> 00:26:35,309
which was the plane issued the denarius
and was probably one of the most densely

497
00:26:35,309 --> 00:26:37,970
populated cities in the world to this
day

498
00:26:37,970 --> 00:26:41,309
in parts little district 7 think the
labels from Mumbai

499
00:26:41,309 --> 00:26:44,529
and it was a near total consumption and
service economy city: with the

500
00:26:44,529 --> 00:26:48,240
Metropolitan culture obsessed with the
trappings have lifestyle with elite

501
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:50,490
goods and some chew area excess

502
00:26:50,490 --> 00:26:55,140
and it had a restive population which
was not afraid of the occasional Ryan

503
00:26:55,140 --> 00:26:58,370
so when things get a little rough you
can it can paddle out the trouble if

504
00:26:58,370 --> 00:27:00,330
you're in charge of making the currency

505
00:27:00,330 --> 00:27:04,120
by adding some extra copper to the
bullion you need to pay more troops

506
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:07,399
innkeeper flows agree moving into the
capital so then you add some more and

507
00:27:07,399 --> 00:27:10,909
slowly over time the money becomes less
and less valuable in trade all kinds of

508
00:27:10,909 --> 00:27:12,830
problems begin to appear

509
00:27:12,830 --> 00:27:16,140
and this problem this crisis is
massively increased

510
00:27:16,140 --> 00:27:20,120
by the transition to heavily leveraged
paper money that's good in bird freaking

511
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:20,950
out

512
00:27:20,950 --> 00:27:26,260
from a cartoon in 1921 as huge amounts
of money pour out a fair printing press
