1
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:05,660
we're gonna

2
00:04:05,660 --> 00:04:08,810
this started as soon as we can find
somebody with a mini DisplayPort to VGA

3
00:04:08,810 --> 00:04:10,550
adapter

4
00:04:10,550 --> 00:04:16,570
someone want of walked off a DARS and it
was not the random I know his was his

5
00:04:16,570 --> 00:04:20,100
alright thank you

6
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:27,100
don't forget to pick it up back it up

7
00:04:41,730 --> 00:04:47,080
us

8
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:54,080
sons

9
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:17,510
okay you're on

10
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:21,750
okay we're ready to roll 3 okay
everybody we're gonna start letter just

11
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:23,820
gotta go quick injure we got it we are
to

12
00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:26,730
I'm in the speaker's election committee
we had hundreds of submissions to have

13
00:06:26,730 --> 00:06:28,030
them were about bio hacking

14
00:06:28,030 --> 00:06:33,600
and a when do in the other side bettors
heard the qualifications are these two

15
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:38,090
folks here they're like they just bowed
out there like we can come even close

16
00:06:38,090 --> 00:06:42,750
just a couple pics patients so I'm all
the time and reduce themselves but to

17
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:46,980
their needless to say Canadians and %ah
they're gonna talk about by high by

18
00:06:46,980 --> 00:06:48,090
attacking or the other

19
00:06:48,090 --> 00:06:51,930
forty-fifth parallel making millions

20
00:06:51,930 --> 00:06:58,660
okay so thanks for the intro and you're
really

21
00:06:58,660 --> 00:07:03,430
you're totally correct our credentials
are I absolutely fantastic I studied in

22
00:07:03,430 --> 00:07:04,350
school for

23
00:07:04,350 --> 00:07:08,790
of fourteen years and I wound up getting
a three-year film degree

24
00:07:08,790 --> 00:07:12,790
at and

25
00:07:12,790 --> 00:07:16,730
but at the same time I also talk my way
into being a visiting scholar

26
00:07:16,730 --> 00:07:20,360
MIT Media Lab doing a stint at nasa ames

27
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:24,430
as well actually that's when I got
started in bio hacking switching over

28
00:07:24,430 --> 00:07:24,910
from

29
00:07:24,910 --> 00:07:28,840
computing human-computer interaction
things like that ordered by hacking

30
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:32,820
now I guess maybe a poster person for
the fact that he

31
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:36,710
you don't need to be a biologist to get
involved in bio hacking

32
00:07:36,710 --> 00:07:40,130
and also before I pass the mic to you
keV arm

33
00:07:40,130 --> 00:07:43,450
by hacking is the newest coolest thing
and if you're not convinced

34
00:07:43,450 --> 00:07:46,850
that by Denver talk come chat with us
leader on

35
00:07:46,850 --> 00:07:50,950
can tell you more reasons why yet

36
00:07:50,950 --> 00:07:54,420
action Kevin on a biologist I guess be

37
00:07:54,420 --> 00:07:57,500
and my background in I can

38
00:07:57,500 --> 00:08:01,020
from the international agenda and use
petitioner I jam

39
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:04,390
yes heard that but I spence

40
00:08:04,390 --> 00:08:07,460
four years getting a four-year degree
I'm in biochemistry

41
00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:10,990
so and yet and

42
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:14,000
now I guess where we compounded the
Montreal

43
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,240
bio acting group called brick a bio and

44
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:21,080
currently I am coming from Cork Ireland
actually cuz

45
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:24,390
working at the company at the same BIOS

46
00:08:24,390 --> 00:08:27,620
her program over there so that's my
story

47
00:08:27,620 --> 00:08:31,800
awesome so yeah we're gonna just
basically dive into it

48
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:35,479
it's not going to be super rigorous is
not to be super long if anyone has any

49
00:08:35,479 --> 00:08:36,910
questions feel free to you

50
00:08:36,910 --> 00:08:40,080
robs media

51
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:44,270
but yes on the on screen now this is our
Twitter stuff you can rate

52
00:08:44,270 --> 00:08:47,340
for later 23 sir to us

53
00:08:47,340 --> 00:08:50,870
stuff but the first thing your gonna
talk about

54
00:08:50,870 --> 00:08:53,970
is Dr DIY bio and what exactly

55
00:08:53,970 --> 00:08:57,470
is it yes so I am a certified

56
00:08:57,470 --> 00:09:01,210
just generally saying wanna do with
biology which is

57
00:09:01,210 --> 00:09:05,710
you know you want to know about health
drugs disease one about the environments

58
00:09:05,710 --> 00:09:09,020
trees and other living things we won the
hearts and grow

59
00:09:09,020 --> 00:09:12,460
food and housing beer solely

60
00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:16,860
yet your and everyone over

61
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:19,910
longevity that's like Eugene 1.0 forever

62
00:09:19,910 --> 00:09:23,610
and sir just an ongoing thing

63
00:09:23,610 --> 00:09:27,460
and then I guess in terms of the thing
at two cents

64
00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:30,460
you think about the traditional training
to become a biologist

65
00:09:30,460 --> 00:09:34,990
you have to you you know below 100 grand
and get some country and take 10 years

66
00:09:34,990 --> 00:09:36,680
until you actually get some kind

67
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:40,070
job we do your own work anything

68
00:09:40,070 --> 00:09:43,910
and it's sort of like a very you know
pat

69
00:09:43,910 --> 00:09:47,210
driven close pride its I'm industry

70
00:09:47,210 --> 00:09:51,560
so right now it's a bit like an all-boys
club where you can

71
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:55,040
for the getting unless you have all the
money in time zone

72
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:58,600
brings this and so there's issues drives

73
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:01,800
take go to the institution

74
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:06,610
co-starred now so

75
00:10:06,610 --> 00:10:10,930
yeah for sure so the good news is that
if any view have been

76
00:10:10,930 --> 00:10:15,000
around four age when computing change
from

77
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:19,360
super expensive super exclusive locked
up in university labs

78
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:22,810
military score where cost a million
bucks

79
00:10:22,810 --> 00:10:26,260
you had to be a PhD student even get
access to you

80
00:10:26,260 --> 00:10:29,360
computer and then you look at

81
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:32,960
okay what happened in the early eighties
and F lee the nineties where computers

82
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:36,870
became cheap desktop early nineties
people started sharing

83
00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:41,040
code after everything from scratch and
barriers to entry to get involved in

84
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:41,670
computing

85
00:10:41,670 --> 00:10:45,760
user or programmer was lowered
considerably

86
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:49,190
and right now we're witnessing the same
thing

87
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:52,820
happening for biology so as kevin said
you know you might

88
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:56,589
you know before me defuse we may need a
hundred thousand dollars agree 10 years

89
00:10:56,589 --> 00:10:59,730
et cetera et cetera that's totally not
the case right now

90
00:10:59,730 --> 00:11:04,050
and its really really an exciting time
for biology

91
00:11:04,050 --> 00:11:07,820
and we'll just talk a little bit more
about White Sox yet

92
00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:11,070
so the next commonality between you

93
00:11:11,070 --> 00:11:15,230
by when securing is that you know genes
are coded some people don't like this

94
00:11:15,230 --> 00:11:16,140
analogy but

95
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:19,740
whenever it works and so behind you can
see

96
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:24,089
this going device cause for something
called a fluorescent protein and this is

97
00:11:24,089 --> 00:11:26,390
a personal concerns and jellyfish that

98
00:11:26,390 --> 00:11:29,510
somebody found and it basically

99
00:11:29,510 --> 00:11:33,140
you know it's a sequence of letters and
when you

100
00:11:33,140 --> 00:11:36,890
with the DNA into your bacteria its

101
00:11:36,890 --> 00:11:41,540
changes the alerted and misled was right
under you

102
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:44,880
the next are you

103
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:48,940
rate so this is sort of what it looks
like and this is very much like the

104
00:11:48,940 --> 00:11:49,880
hello world

105
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:53,060
an experiment for the Allied I owe you

106
00:11:53,060 --> 00:11:56,170
you can some Europeans I got close
amazing and its

107
00:11:56,170 --> 00:11:59,420
here your LED board have another or
pitcher

108
00:11:59,420 --> 00:12:03,290
weekend there is just like names
pictures /a

109
00:12:03,290 --> 00:12:07,190
medical stuff you yeah and

110
00:12:07,190 --> 00:12:11,680
killings get something that's cool so
few

111
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:15,280
if you can answer play with us and go
along with the idea DNA

112
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:19,670
is code if we actually do have the kind
of tools today to be able to

113
00:12:19,670 --> 00:12:23,130
and DNA code median is just for letters

114
00:12:23,130 --> 00:12:29,010
ABC GnT just text and so that means that
with the computer you can manipulate

115
00:12:29,010 --> 00:12:32,440
which is exciting and so there are tools
that are out there

116
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:36,960
allow people to do that so before in
this life here we had a tool that showed

117
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:40,040
according to my sis's the Pirates
database

118
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:43,740
but they're are excluding number tools

119
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:47,880
then urgently me open source community
now intervale so you'll have to pee

120
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:51,070
ten thousand dollars for DNA design tool

121
00:12:51,070 --> 00:12:54,320
ID you can go online

122
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:57,740
take a look at if 31 so here's an
example one it's like a

123
00:12:57,740 --> 00:13:02,620
in a web browser there's DNA coding here
it doesn't really mean too much to me to

124
00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:03,970
look at a glance

125
00:13:03,970 --> 00:13:08,240
you can drill down in CDs coding regions
which think its functions

126
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:12,480
you can literally cut peace those as if
you're cutting and pasting a function

127
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:16,240
JavaScript program and then paste that
into you

128
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:19,959
a new DNA document and munching and
thinking

129
00:13:19,959 --> 00:13:23,000
learning you'll actually be able to have
that

130
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:26,010
new organism expressed

131
00:13:26,010 --> 00:13:29,170
genetic

132
00:13:29,170 --> 00:13:32,780
yes next just to mention a bit like the
hardware that need to start doing

133
00:13:32,780 --> 00:13:36,280
by attacking so for one rate

134
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:40,260
my rate your left yes user my
competitors which

135
00:13:40,260 --> 00:13:44,030
Arby's used moves in on us liquids
between

136
00:13:44,030 --> 00:13:47,459
you know from one likely micrometer to
you one milliliter

137
00:13:47,459 --> 00:13:50,500
typically and you can get these

138
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:54,440
how you express for pretty cheap and you
can feel that their

139
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:58,600
preachy when you get them but at least
it's you know an expensive in

140
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:01,690
use it for a little while and on

141
00:14:01,690 --> 00:14:04,940
right side I guess you have these
incubators

142
00:14:04,940 --> 00:14:08,680
which you'd use seems to be a bacteria
some degrees in

143
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:12,089
is the Bruins culture and then your
typical

144
00:14:12,089 --> 00:14:15,339
industries or requests for stuff

145
00:14:15,339 --> 00:14:18,540
NY 21e bacteria overnight

146
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:21,970
what does that do you below the back
developments are you working with any

147
00:14:21,970 --> 00:14:24,330
stress at 30 degrees Celsius

148
00:14:24,330 --> 00:14:28,100
but the bacteria that is the live stream
E-coli

149
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:31,550
which is completely safe comes from you
got injured

150
00:14:31,550 --> 00:14:35,959
there's an degrees Celsius which is here
here it's like

151
00:14:35,959 --> 00:14:40,140
here anyways some degree Celsius

152
00:14:40,140 --> 00:14:44,370
and which yes it's absurd in senator got
and therefore that's ideal temperature

153
00:14:44,370 --> 00:14:46,420
for these next

154
00:14:46,420 --> 00:14:50,860
such get them basically double
population

155
00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:54,000
20 minutes so since exponentially

156
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,140
exactly this link up computing is an ex

157
00:14:57,140 --> 00:15:04,140
biology is also next yes

158
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:08,330
we have another tool here so this is %uh
an example

159
00:15:08,330 --> 00:15:11,730
DIY PCI for PCR machine

160
00:15:11,730 --> 00:15:15,830
I'm PCR aids in the help basically
creating martinis

161
00:15:15,830 --> 00:15:20,120
few get a piece of DNA you wanna get
more you can do this process called

162
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:24,160
memories chain reaction and if you were
to buy one of these products that comes

163
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:24,520
from

164
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:27,740
big corporations easily spend ten
thousand dollars

165
00:15:27,740 --> 00:15:30,800
fifteen thousand dollars twenty thousand
dollars depending on how

166
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:34,510
cool this one possible thousand dollars
army

167
00:15:34,510 --> 00:15:38,300
in to spy on line and it works pretty
good used

168
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:42,570
once work great that's the open PCR

169
00:15:42,570 --> 00:15:45,590
projects which is you

170
00:15:45,590 --> 00:15:48,710
insertions online somewhere and then the
one that

171
00:15:48,710 --> 00:15:52,720
left is called huge which is a
centrifuge also essential

172
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:57,850
to doing canister because after you grow
your experience liquids

173
00:15:57,850 --> 00:16:01,650
want to you just

174
00:16:01,650 --> 00:16:07,090
fasten x3 sold

175
00:16:07,090 --> 00:16:10,460
yeah

176
00:16:10,460 --> 00:16:14,300
and just send the colo

177
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:17,810
these pipettes are where the more
annoying things and

178
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:20,930
have that have been tax yet for for
doing by so

179
00:16:20,930 --> 00:16:24,950
with anyone you like hiking up and which
moves

180
00:16:24,950 --> 00:16:29,550
all with amazing she brings up

181
00:16:29,550 --> 00:16:32,970
an interesting point you know by hacking
scene

182
00:16:32,970 --> 00:16:38,280
is necessarily multi-disciplinary so for
example in our experience in precal by

183
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:42,700
we have biologists like Kevin really
know a lot about the biology

184
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:45,800
there's people like me who have
computing background but there's also

185
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:46,780
people that have

186
00:16:46,780 --> 00:16:50,450
engineering backgrounds are backgrounds
la backgrounds

187
00:16:50,450 --> 00:16:54,340
it's the kind of thing where because
it's so tactile compare to you

188
00:16:54,340 --> 00:16:59,550
writing code for example it's really
easy to get involved scam Lake

189
00:16:59,550 --> 00:17:03,250
you know if you've been in the kitchen
before you you're probably familiar with

190
00:17:03,250 --> 00:17:06,720
a good portion of the kind of things
that happen

191
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:11,300
by lab by lattice far more per se siente
more expensive spoons and cups

192
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:14,329
but you get to me cooler things

193
00:17:14,330 --> 00:17:17,580
you to make things that make themselves
off I'm in the kitchen

194
00:17:17,580 --> 00:17:21,420
make a cake I don't put the cake into an
incubator

195
00:17:21,420 --> 00:17:26,050
wake up the next morning with eighty
case which

196
00:17:26,050 --> 00:17:29,770
need but the cool thing about biology is
that you know you're making these

197
00:17:29,770 --> 00:17:32,850
Living Products can do work on your
behalf

198
00:17:32,850 --> 00:17:36,420
to the pictures the caption before the
work that those microorganisms we're

199
00:17:36,420 --> 00:17:38,180
doing we're creating colors it was
almost

200
00:17:38,180 --> 00:17:41,450
you can see her the growing paint
growing

201
00:17:41,450 --> 00:17:44,530
or something if you think about the cost
printer ink

202
00:17:44,530 --> 00:17:48,260
bye week I think it's something like the
same price is called

203
00:17:48,260 --> 00:17:51,490
in the same kinda ballpark is something
instead

204
00:17:51,490 --> 00:17:54,770
we more exactly its it's insane and you
know with

205
00:17:54,770 --> 00:17:58,680
with by attacking you know there's a
real possibility that somebody could

206
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:03,160
develop product allows you to grow your
printer ink at home

207
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:06,650
for you know very low cost and its
totally sustainable

208
00:18:06,650 --> 00:18:09,810
and there's people working on projects
like this for example

209
00:18:09,810 --> 00:18:14,310
and of course that takes people the
biology people that know

210
00:18:14,310 --> 00:18:18,830
chemistry and also maybe art artistic
people that have deep understanding of

211
00:18:18,830 --> 00:18:19,410
color

212
00:18:19,410 --> 00:18:22,910
what makes a good blue glue for example
which

213
00:18:22,910 --> 00:18:27,380
sneakers his

214
00:18:27,380 --> 00:18:31,240
next so we have something really cool
here so

215
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:35,430
you know in in the lab you do have to
use these tools like

216
00:18:35,430 --> 00:18:39,600
said glassware and to somebody like me

217
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:42,940
versus Kevin is a real biologist who has

218
00:18:42,940 --> 00:18:47,030
years of training in relapse
universities and companies

219
00:18:47,030 --> 00:18:51,020
versus me I've only used DIY tools

220
00:18:51,020 --> 00:18:55,380
at that point not very good one of the
reasons why my background is in

221
00:18:55,380 --> 00:18:59,210
computing is because I I can't hold in
or pencil

222
00:18:59,210 --> 00:19:03,440
draw something piece of paper look very
good I can take really well

223
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:07,790
I don't I'm not that kinda person that
has exterior so

224
00:19:07,790 --> 00:19:14,790
I'm really poor

225
00:19:22,770 --> 00:19:23,990
apps

226
00:19:23,990 --> 00:19:24,650
and I

227
00:19:24,650 --> 00:19:28,220
download those lot skills and this is a

228
00:19:28,220 --> 00:19:31,290
this is a real thing so this is a this
is a project that's coming into Jen

229
00:19:31,290 --> 00:19:31,840
space

230
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:35,240
and Tish it's called open transits less
than a year old

231
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:39,690
om you can you can they don't so many
more but these facilities DIY kits

232
00:19:39,690 --> 00:19:42,700
and there they're working on something
even better now

233
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:46,130
but keep your eyes open for stuff like
this not as open transfer there's other

234
00:19:46,130 --> 00:19:47,410
people are working this piece

235
00:19:47,410 --> 00:19:48,390
it's cut
