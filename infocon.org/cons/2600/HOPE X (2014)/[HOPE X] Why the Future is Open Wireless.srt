1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:03,669
that we need to talk to you guys about
open wireless about the open while this

2
00:00:03,669 --> 00:00:05,279
movement and

3
00:00:05,279 --> 00:00:08,460
open wireless is a project that we back

4
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:12,030
raw from Electronic Frontier Foundation
and that we've been working on for the

5
00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:13,049
last few years

6
00:00:13,049 --> 00:00:16,309
and at its it's getting better and
better

7
00:00:16,309 --> 00:00:20,730
as yeah days you want and so I just by
way of introduction I'm

8
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:24,570
I think and I am an activist at your
fast %um

9
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:27,890
shirt I'm decurtis 011 asap attorneys at
yet not

10
00:00:27,890 --> 00:00:31,779
and 12 think wanna several things they
were gone is the critters Rights Project

11
00:00:31,779 --> 00:00:32,529
Scientist

12
00:00:32,529 --> 00:00:35,890
and on Packers cookers leaders
programmers

13
00:00:35,890 --> 00:00:38,950
trying to keep you guys are in trouble
and try and help you

14
00:00:38,950 --> 00:00:42,710
deductible when you get and that spurred
I'm on this bill

15
00:00:42,710 --> 00:00:49,190
and at

16
00:00:49,190 --> 00:00:52,219
in schism I and I'm not longer Christian

17
00:00:52,219 --> 00:00:56,430
I'm a technology fellow at the half
assed and I actually joined

18
00:00:56,430 --> 00:01:01,520
just last year up to work specifically
on this project and it has been

19
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:04,549
very exciting and I hope to show where
we are

20
00:01:04,549 --> 00:01:07,900
with it today at sue the

21
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:11,729
open wireless project and it has a lot
of

22
00:01:11,729 --> 00:01:15,320
group I'm but but one other wanted

23
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:18,830
and issues that this trend is solved is

24
00:01:18,830 --> 00:01:22,250
one that we may have all experienced I
definitely experience

25
00:01:22,250 --> 00:01:25,740
an intact the other day I was at home

26
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:28,780
and at my net went out and

27
00:01:28,780 --> 00:01:32,810
I check the mail networks and they were
there are 15 networks

28
00:01:32,810 --> 00:01:35,869
and and most amoral Oct

29
00:01:35,869 --> 00:01:38,930
and and i cant access anything

30
00:01:38,930 --> 00:01:42,310
and which is unfortunate and and

31
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:45,740
I did see one unlocked at work here is
how big blue house: guest

32
00:01:45,740 --> 00:01:49,680
and and I knew exactly which house this
was on my street

33
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:52,759
and and I'm like great you guys are

34
00:01:52,759 --> 00:01:56,670
gonna let me use your your internet
thank you friendly neighbors

35
00:01:56,670 --> 00:02:01,259
unfortunately I ran into this i right
afterwards and I say

36
00:02:01,259 --> 00:02:05,610
captive portal and and it says you know
enter the guest account password

37
00:02:05,610 --> 00:02:09,310
at which I didn't know anything really
wanna go over and knock on the door and

38
00:02:09,310 --> 00:02:10,379
ask for the password

39
00:02:10,379 --> 00:02:13,720
and this is the sort of issue where

40
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:17,629
you know we're living in a world where
walking in the street

41
00:02:17,629 --> 00:02:21,670
sitting at home in the office whatever
we have a buncha

42
00:02:21,670 --> 00:02:24,950
wireless networks available and yet
never actually

43
00:02:24,950 --> 00:02:28,160
accessible and and that

44
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:31,780
it seems inefficient s I'm there's
another story from

45
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:35,280
around a couple years ago when a.m. we
were watching this project

46
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:38,830
and where and hurricane sandy happen

47
00:02:38,830 --> 00:02:42,069
and how you guys are from around here
I'm

48
00:02:42,069 --> 00:02:45,450
I can't see anything so I'm assuming
there's some heads up

49
00:02:45,450 --> 00:02:49,090
I realize that was useless I'm

50
00:02:49,090 --> 00:02:52,760
well I i'm sorry is that experience
hurricane sandy cuz

51
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:56,050
it seemed awful but and but that

52
00:02:56,050 --> 00:03:00,209
one of the things that came after that
is it with the power outages and with

53
00:03:00,209 --> 00:03:01,450
the outages have service

54
00:03:01,450 --> 00:03:04,519
and so we saw things like this

55
00:03:04,519 --> 00:03:07,489
at this is a friend who tweeted this out
an awesome picture Internet

56
00:03:07,489 --> 00:03:08,610
infrastructure new yorkers

57
00:03:08,610 --> 00:03:12,170
idling for free working wifi outside of
Starbucks I'm

58
00:03:12,170 --> 00:03:15,349
and this is actually right around the
corner I'm did

59
00:03:15,349 --> 00:03:19,360
Starbucks is one of the few places that
was offering free wifi that was working

60
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:23,480
and that people can actually access and
you know these are people who

61
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:27,500
at needed to get in contact with people
and needed to check the email need to

62
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:28,239
send out

63
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:31,670
and you know I'm OK and Twitter updates

64
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:35,500
and the these are people who needed to
use the internet and yet they couldn't

65
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:39,150
I'm and at the one place that was copper
offering

66
00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:43,480
and but some sort of open wifi sensor
free wifi

67
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:46,870
what is a.m. Starbucks it's so

68
00:03:46,870 --> 00:03:50,769
with this in mind we we've started the
open wireless movement and

69
00:03:50,769 --> 00:03:54,500
and the point of the open wireless
movement is to encourage

70
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:58,280
I open wireless is to its a Creole world
we're open wireless

71
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:01,720
is the nor and and at

72
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:05,049
you know we're more where imagine a
world future

73
00:04:05,049 --> 00:04:10,510
with ubiquitous open internet and why
would you do this why we open up your

74
00:04:10,510 --> 00:04:11,170
wireless

75
00:04:11,170 --> 00:04:14,780
networks and at to good question

76
00:04:14,780 --> 00:04:18,199
and part it could be because sharing I'm
sharing some

77
00:04:18,199 --> 00:04:21,650
actually a very important thing and you
know not all of us are using all over

78
00:04:21,650 --> 00:04:24,440
again with all the time now officer use
internet works all the time

79
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:28,880
but we've been in situations where we
need to get on the internet

80
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:32,910
and and we couldn't and it would be nice
if someone share the Internet with us

81
00:04:32,910 --> 00:04:36,180
and but we at yes I've actually

82
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:40,690
as a board member I brush ir who and who
runs over wireless network and it said

83
00:04:40,690 --> 00:04:41,030
it

84
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:44,919
the I like is quite a lot it he says to
me it's basic politeness

85
00:04:44,919 --> 00:04:49,199
to run an open wireless network and
providing access guests can like buying

86
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:49,660
heat

87
00:04:49,660 --> 00:04:52,940
and electricity are hot cup of tea and
and who doesn't like that

88
00:04:52,940 --> 00:04:56,550
and but besides access and

89
00:04:56,550 --> 00:05:00,139
why open wireless an axis capital only
issued a lot of

90
00:05:00,139 --> 00:05:04,139
a and groups and and people advocating
for accessing the Internet

91
00:05:04,139 --> 00:05:07,470
and that's that's an issue that a lot of
people are dealing with right now

92
00:05:07,470 --> 00:05:11,100
an overall is by no means the be all end
all of this but I'm

93
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:15,330
it is a step in the right direction I'm
want to be reasons is

94
00:05:15,330 --> 00:05:19,490
is privacy and now how can you have an
opening up your network be conducive to

95
00:05:19,490 --> 00:05:21,199
privacy and this is something record

96
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:24,560
talk about quite a bit from that from
legal perspective and technical

97
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:25,620
perspective

98
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:29,280
and but and one reason is because

99
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:33,120
right now one more mobile right now
we're going or roving around

100
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:36,650
I'm were tied to these things were tight
for smartphones I'm

101
00:05:36,650 --> 00:05:40,889
and that when we want to access data
online access the Internet

102
00:05:40,889 --> 00:05:44,259
and the smartphones use

103
00:05:44,259 --> 00:05:47,500
I networks offered by folks like these

104
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:53,720
and and that's kind of an issue right if
we want to be mobile if we want to use

105
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:58,530
and devices not taxing internet we're
not close to a wireless network that we

106
00:05:58,530 --> 00:05:59,610
have access to

107
00:05:59,610 --> 00:06:04,169
and we have to pay a contract to use the
search services

108
00:06:04,169 --> 00:06:07,470
I'm in our store closures are
essentially tracking devices

109
00:06:07,470 --> 00:06:10,810
and so went to be nice if if and

110
00:06:10,810 --> 00:06:14,789
you know the the privacy world we
imagine actually fostered

111
00:06:14,789 --> 00:06:17,810
assert innovation that we're we're

112
00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:21,800
were seeking if they actually foster
innovation that

113
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:24,720
didn't have to rely on these few big
players and could actually take

114
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:25,410
advantage

115
00:06:25,410 --> 00:06:29,310
have all these wireless networks I'm
running through it right now

116
00:06:29,310 --> 00:06:33,229
I'm and and this to me any sort of
innovation here are four random pictures

117
00:06:33,229 --> 00:06:34,090
I found

118
00:06:34,090 --> 00:06:37,419
and if you wanna connector dot if you
wanna at

119
00:06:37,419 --> 00:06:40,550
have a wash that there's something smart
if you wanna face

120
00:06:40,550 --> 00:06:44,030
mask I'm not actually quite sure that is
Billy kinda cool and

121
00:06:44,030 --> 00:06:48,850
add and it could be connected to the
wireless internet and when that be great

122
00:06:48,850 --> 00:06:53,349
and potentially I don't know but these
are some innovations that but you can't

123
00:06:53,349 --> 00:06:55,720
necessarily use out in the open because

124
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:59,870
you you know AT&T and Verizon and and so

125
00:06:59,870 --> 00:07:03,539
and have this sort of ahead domain
covered

126
00:07:03,539 --> 00:07:08,210
and what are the questions that people
ask is alright fine I'm

127
00:07:08,210 --> 00:07:12,650
I'm I'm may be okay with opening up my
wireless internet I may be okay with

128
00:07:12,650 --> 00:07:13,280
opening up

129
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:16,380
in a part in it and but but

130
00:07:16,380 --> 00:07:20,280
doesn't this doesn't opening I was never
just reward freeloaders

131
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:23,590
and kept people just get online and

132
00:07:23,590 --> 00:07:28,169
and do whatever they want with it and
not pay for anything and is not set

133
00:07:28,169 --> 00:07:31,630
and and and our answers no a at

134
00:07:31,630 --> 00:07:36,580
you know it this sir world that we want
to live it we're trying to imagine

135
00:07:36,580 --> 00:07:40,620
a future where having that sort of
culture sharing

136
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:44,460
and and having that sort of culture
openness is something that we can

137
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:48,220
and actually fostered actually go
towards

138
00:07:48,220 --> 00:07:51,770
and so you we're trying to fight against
this mentality that

139
00:07:51,770 --> 00:07:55,819
this is this is a bad thing that this is
my wireless internet I need to lock it

140
00:07:55,819 --> 00:07:58,039
down and have it be mine mine mine

141
00:07:58,039 --> 00:08:02,240
and because we think with sharing with
open wireless

142
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:05,340
I'm it's sort of a rising tides and
affecting everybody

143
00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:08,830
everybody benefits at so with that we're
getting to you

144
00:08:08,830 --> 00:08:12,440
the final legal matters

145
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:15,650
that's me as I said earlier I'm

146
00:08:15,650 --> 00:08:18,870
this on can you hear me great

147
00:08:18,870 --> 00:08:21,960
on as I said earlier I'm a car design
stuff attorney

148
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:25,259
at UF on and one of the things I do is

149
00:08:25,259 --> 00:08:28,639
I'm consulate tomorrow's crunch I also
do clockers rates

150
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:32,529
so now is my my quick little lawyer
stuff disclaimer I am a lawyer

151
00:08:32,529 --> 00:08:36,909
I'm not your lawyer and nothing I say
will change that

152
00:08:36,909 --> 00:08:40,969
in mice you're already one of my clients
in which case I'm not talking to you

153
00:08:40,969 --> 00:08:44,370
on so I will not be giving legal advice
today

154
00:08:44,370 --> 00:08:47,640
if you come up to the microphone after
we're done talking which we will invite

155
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:48,430
you to do

156
00:08:48,430 --> 00:08:51,740
and you ask a question calls for legal
advice this is not a confidential

157
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:52,410
setting

158
00:08:52,410 --> 00:08:55,640
so I can't give it to you in this I
think I will give you my card we can

159
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:56,709
talk about it later

160
00:08:56,709 --> 00:08:59,769
in a confidential setting but this isn't

161
00:08:59,769 --> 00:09:03,220
go get copyright there are several

162
00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:07,760
and I'm I'm to address sort of three
sort of a little more than three sets of

163
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:08,519
reasons

164
00:09:08,519 --> 00:09:11,959
spotlight open morals isn't a bad idea
on

165
00:09:11,959 --> 00:09:15,730
copyright is is one of the attractions
that a lot of people have to open

166
00:09:15,730 --> 00:09:19,019
Marles and what I mean by that if

167
00:09:19,019 --> 00:09:22,170
I %uh if if I torrent

168
00:09:22,170 --> 00:09:25,269
the whole ton of movies without using
any sir

169
00:09:25,269 --> 00:09:29,019
action online chances are immunity in CA
I noticed this text

170
00:09:29,019 --> 00:09:33,339
six traits notice are some sort a
complaint right on

171
00:09:33,339 --> 00:09:37,130
if I don't do that I open my my wireless
network to others

172
00:09:37,130 --> 00:09:40,399
I is not a problem on no

173
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:44,080
I don't think it is on and and there's a
number of reasons why

174
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:48,050
by that's the case on if you're not

175
00:09:48,050 --> 00:09:51,589
person guys doing bad stuff online

176
00:09:51,589 --> 00:09:56,370
specially with coppery art you're not be
held responsible

177
00:09:56,370 --> 00:10:00,350
I in copyright there are there there's
one way that you can be held responsible

178
00:10:00,350 --> 00:10:01,220
if you're not

179
00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:05,540
one doing the bad thing copyright
infringement on that secondary label

180
00:10:05,540 --> 00:10:10,980
comes in two flavors: I contributory
liability and vicarious liability

181
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:14,019
I'm these aren't doctrines which

182
00:10:14,019 --> 00:10:17,959
I are extremely fussy in have a lot of
ins and outs but below we need to know

183
00:10:17,959 --> 00:10:18,720
about them

184
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:22,320
for for these purposes is that
contributory liability

185
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:27,310
I requires essentially that the network
operator have knowledge what's going on

186
00:10:27,310 --> 00:10:30,519
and caused or induced that behavior

187
00:10:30,519 --> 00:10:34,070
I in for vicarious liability network
operator has to have the right

188
00:10:34,070 --> 00:10:37,779
ability to control d copyright
infringement going on

189
00:10:37,779 --> 00:10:40,839
and receive direct financial benefit up
from

190
00:10:40,839 --> 00:10:44,040
Concord parchment likely with open
wireless

191
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:48,860
on did didn't those factors are not
satisfied for either contributory

192
00:10:48,860 --> 00:10:51,860
were vicariously I if if I

193
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:55,510
open the wireless network at my house on

194
00:10:55,510 --> 00:10:58,709
you know I don't have actual knowledge
dead anyone is using its

195
00:10:58,709 --> 00:11:01,709
to you to do copyright infringement

196
00:11:01,709 --> 00:11:05,140
what I can tell me I and certainly not
induce

197
00:11:05,140 --> 00:11:08,230
entities I'm not saying desist

198
00:11:08,230 --> 00:11:11,470
7x happen and from my house the
connected moral standard

199
00:11:11,470 --> 00:11:15,110
SSID and use it to torture movies %uh
I'm not

200
00:11:15,110 --> 00:11:18,350
inducing copyright infringement

201
00:11:18,350 --> 00:11:23,510
I don't I'm vicarious liability
similarly the same

202
00:11:23,510 --> 00:11:26,620
I if if I'm in neutral network operator

203
00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:29,880
I don't have the right to delete a
controller keyboard

204
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:36,440
online uk on and it I'm not receiving a
direct financial benefit from it either

205
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:39,980
if you're have an open wireless network
at your house

206
00:11:39,980 --> 00:11:43,430
I'm chances are you're not receiving a
direct financial and

207
00:11:43,430 --> 00:11:46,470
from I'm but there's some other things
think

208
00:11:46,470 --> 00:11:52,060
can help us out here too and this is one
of the aspects to the DNC which is not

209
00:11:52,060 --> 00:11:53,380
entirely bad

210
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:57,870
the DMCA and there's the code number I
was told that maybe thrillers the

211
00:11:57,870 --> 00:11:58,430
chronic

212
00:11:58,430 --> 00:12:01,730
silly credit for this that's why I
actually included

213
00:12:01,730 --> 00:12:05,839
peace doctor some key cycles layer down
I and

214
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:09,990
statutes and there's section 512 the
DMCA

215
00:12:09,990 --> 00:12:13,470
a creates a safe harbor for network
providers I this is completely optional

216
00:12:13,470 --> 00:12:15,380
network providers do not have to take

217
00:12:15,380 --> 00:12:19,180
injured a bit if they don't want but
it's often a good idea

218
00:12:19,180 --> 00:12:22,519
we have a plan for how they can do this
with Wireless

219
00:12:22,519 --> 00:12:26,139
on we've crafted a simple policy

220
00:12:26,139 --> 00:12:29,820
one of the requirements for the safe
harbor

221
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:33,160
if you want to take advantage in the
team's safe harbor provisions

222
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:36,980
I is that you have policy ATM's policy

223
00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:41,570
I and we have a simple for you the
policy says

224
00:12:41,570 --> 00:12:46,089
thats you know you can't uses for
copyright infringement

225
00:12:46,089 --> 00:12:49,089
I and that you that the network operator

226
00:12:49,089 --> 00:12:53,519
will terminate repeat infringers against
the the other

227
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:56,339
part the safe harbors that it must
accompany rights holders technical

228
00:12:56,339 --> 00:12:57,350
measures

229
00:12:57,350 --> 00:13:00,579
others technical measures must be
tightly grip on its never happens

230
00:13:00,579 --> 00:13:04,019
we don't really have to reap on so

231
00:13:04,019 --> 00:13:07,540
safe harbor you in Oracle

232
00:13:07,540 --> 00:13:11,220
five top am sex subsection am section
512

233
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:14,920
says that the network provider does not
need affirmatively

234
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:18,760
monitor network to qualify for safe
harbor and then even comes under the

235
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:20,540
missile subheading privacy

236
00:13:20,540 --> 00:13:23,660
on so split a safe harbor in general

237
00:13:23,660 --> 00:13:27,149
I it uses a way that provide his way to
provide

238
00:13:27,149 --> 00:13:30,250
community to the network provider to
DMCA

239
00:13:30,250 --> 00:13:33,389
on complaints we think

240
00:13:33,389 --> 00:13:37,050
that the sample policy that we've
crafted adult models top

241
00:13:37,050 --> 00:13:40,420
word I am running an open wireless
network

242
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:43,730
on at home writers business I'll and

243
00:13:43,730 --> 00:13:46,790
in a few posts policy over here for to
that which we think

244
00:13:46,790 --> 00:13:50,370
were doing by having your societies
milestone or compulsory

245
00:13:50,370 --> 00:13:54,060
there tomorrow start on be there's a
good argument

246
00:13:54,060 --> 00:13:57,420
it is contested on that that would haha

247
00:13:57,420 --> 00:14:02,370
and you would not be liable under the
DNC

248
00:14:02,370 --> 00:14:06,160
negligence Sun lawyers

249
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:09,910
hi and I won't call controls but they're
trolls on have

250
00:14:09,910 --> 00:14:13,510
%uh have decided that be

251
00:14:13,510 --> 00:14:16,779
very actor running an open wireless
network at your house

252
00:14:16,779 --> 00:14:20,339
is negligent likely

253
00:14:20,339 --> 00:14:25,149
they're wrong and the two courts to
address it directly have told them that

254
00:14:25,149 --> 00:14:26,070
they're wrong

255
00:14:26,070 --> 00:14:29,320
I in very very strong language other

256
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:33,269
running an open wireless network is not
negligence

257
00:14:33,269 --> 00:14:37,870
on what I mean probably because that's
what

258
00:14:37,870 --> 00:14:42,170
Wireless was originally meant to do
great it's not a preacher to do you care

259
00:14:42,170 --> 00:14:45,209
if that's the standard which is

260
00:14:45,209 --> 00:14:48,889
completely true risk

261
00:14:48,889 --> 00:14:52,070
this is %uh did this is something on

262
00:14:52,070 --> 00:14:55,470
this is one of the worst I'm strong
objections to you

263
00:14:55,470 --> 00:14:59,350
open wireless when me I after Andy
Greenberg story

264
00:14:59,350 --> 00:15:02,480
on this project came out a couple weeks
ago I

265
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:06,709
reddit thread was dominated by people
saying by Rhonda Byrne miles to work at

266
00:15:06,709 --> 00:15:08,620
my house and gets what

267
00:15:08,620 --> 00:15:11,899
great I'm gonna get a spot in Boston on
my door

268
00:15:11,899 --> 00:15:15,690
for people downloading child porn
whatever else

269
00:15:15,690 --> 00:15:20,040
ittt on your on that his knots

270
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:25,459
completely out of the question however
all our people run open wireless today

271
00:15:25,459 --> 00:15:30,120
and it doesn't swat teams are you
doesn't happen very often

272
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:33,820
I and the more people who run open
wireless

273
00:15:33,820 --> 00:15:36,880
the less likely disc be

274
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:39,630
so there's a little bit of a first-mover
problem but likely you're not be the

275
00:15:39,630 --> 00:15:40,040
person

276
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:43,630
for the person was yours years on

277
00:15:43,630 --> 00:15:46,670
if you know if you're running open
wireless and

278
00:15:46,670 --> 00:15:50,350
police comes to investigate the CD
running open wireless

279
00:15:50,350 --> 00:15:53,560
new maybe that would help your child on

280
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:56,860
sometimes please don't do that thorough
investigation pretend you're so that's

281
00:15:56,860 --> 00:15:58,610
not a

282
00:15:58,610 --> 00:16:03,060
that's not sure fire but there some
other things we can do to minimum

283
00:16:03,060 --> 00:16:07,070
to mitigate the risk here I and and 1
others things

284
00:16:07,070 --> 00:16:10,850
is in the future lease odd

285
00:16:10,850 --> 00:16:14,519
this offer their hungers talk about
we're gonna have

286
00:16:14,519 --> 00:16:19,300
the option routing all to be a guest
network traffic over the piano your

287
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:20,110
choice

288
00:16:20,110 --> 00:16:23,949
worked or on now will on not lead

289
00:16:23,949 --> 00:16:27,430
anyone back to your IP obviously this is

290
00:16:27,430 --> 00:16:31,860
on I'm not recommending that you do your
child porn surfing

291
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:36,029
hurt or you can in fact I recommend that
you do not do that

292
00:16:36,029 --> 00:16:40,120
on but hopefully most people don't

293
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:43,190
Tom do really horrible things online

294
00:16:43,190 --> 00:16:47,449
on I know I've been running in girls
work at my house for years

295
00:16:47,449 --> 00:16:52,089
and I've never been spotted you know I i
don't think I'm unique

296
00:16:52,089 --> 00:16:55,699
so I think the risk odd eat the risk is
there

297
00:16:55,699 --> 00:16:59,500
but it is overstated on there some other
things

298
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:02,579
which I don't really have a slight for
which I i do want to talk about his

299
00:17:02,579 --> 00:17:03,829
auntie said

300
00:17:03,829 --> 00:17:06,839
on how does open wireless

301
00:17:06,839 --> 00:17:10,010
increase your privacy and the price you

302
00:17:10,010 --> 00:17:13,929
others out right now there's

303
00:17:13,929 --> 00:17:17,470
I wouldn't say it's legal theory but
there's prevailing attitude

304
00:17:17,470 --> 00:17:21,419
that up a person's identity can be
determined

305
00:17:21,419 --> 00:17:24,980
simply by the IP address on we can touch
wrong

306
00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:29,220
we think an IP address can sometimes be
a proxy for eternity

307
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:33,230
but of is I NH as absolutely not
includes

308
00:17:33,230 --> 00:17:36,370
and Chris are starting to come around
this I'm its

309
00:17:36,370 --> 00:17:40,270
it's been tested most often copyright
troll situation

310
00:17:40,270 --> 00:17:44,580
on wary multimedia issues 79 year old
grandmother for downloading

311
00:17:44,580 --> 00:17:48,780
unspeakable title on and the 79-year-old
grandmother says

312
00:17:48,780 --> 00:17:52,710
I wasn't download unspeakable title it
couldn't possibly

313
00:17:52,710 --> 00:17:56,070
me sable your the subscriber on the IP
address

314
00:17:56,070 --> 00:17:59,950
she said yeah but that doesn't was me
I'm so the more people who do you open

315
00:17:59,950 --> 00:18:00,770
wireless

316
00:18:00,770 --> 00:18:05,520
the harder it is going to be as a legal
matter to claim that an IP address

317
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:09,350
is your identity and a great entity is
your IP address

318
00:18:09,350 --> 00:18:12,700
on we don't think that's a good thing

319
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:17,410
but secondly I distorted ubiquitous
tracking

320
00:18:17,410 --> 00:18:20,980
and Ed is permissible permissible

321
00:18:20,980 --> 00:18:24,870
technically due to the fact that we all
have a tracking device

322
00:18:24,870 --> 00:18:28,630
in our pockets I and as i deleted 2

323
00:18:28,630 --> 00:18:31,820
the network is controlled generally by

324
00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:35,200
spirit small handful very large
providers on

325
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:39,240
ok miles can go a long way to change and
sorted ubiquitous tracking that

326
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:40,140
something like

327
00:18:40,140 --> 00:18:43,380
AT&T smartphone allows odd

328
00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:46,419
will be a lot harder if I'm hopping from

329
00:18:46,419 --> 00:18:49,970
hopping on sleep from one wireless
networked

330
00:18:49,970 --> 00:18:53,620
I'll and you know you become a striking
everybody

331
00:18:53,620 --> 00:18:58,340
is not good one of the things that we do
it yet that is we sued the NSA

332
00:18:58,340 --> 00:19:01,860
on to make them stop tracking us all the
time

333
00:19:01,860 --> 00:19:07,280
ubiquitous open wireless is not an issue
here but it will make their job

334
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:11,200
more difficult which we think is good

335
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:16,600
on you know a guest the algiers it's
creating a big reached

336
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:20,429
which is good for you and good

337
00:19:20,429 --> 00:19:24,710
and that's the end the worst

338
00:19:24,710 --> 00:19:25,780
them

339
00:19:25,780 --> 00:19:29,480
you ginger okay was hard

340
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:33,380
so I am

341
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:37,970
I'm going to talk about where all of
this thinking at the AFL flag

342
00:19:37,970 --> 00:19:41,420
which was that that the concepts were
great but

343
00:19:41,420 --> 00:19:45,890
people who even wanted a to deploy is
open wireless had some technical

344
00:19:45,890 --> 00:19:46,860
challenges

345
00:19:46,860 --> 00:19:50,190
and so in order to make this real

346
00:19:50,190 --> 00:19:54,110
we we need to address those technical
challenges and and making easy for

347
00:19:54,110 --> 00:19:55,050
people to do

348
00:19:55,050 --> 00:19:58,820
what do you wanna do so I'm that's the
motivation

349
00:19:58,820 --> 00:20:02,320
and so we decided we will create a

350
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:07,500
a router from there that people collect
put onto existing hardware that they

351
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:08,100
could get

352
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:11,230
you know off-the-shelf I'll and

353
00:20:11,230 --> 00:20:15,460
that would be the start and then we
would see the kind of interest we got

354
00:20:15,460 --> 00:20:18,680
and then think about what the next steps
are I'm

355
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:21,890
so we started off with you know how do
we make sharing

356
00:20:21,890 --> 00:20:26,780
easy but we realized that we needed to
solve a couple other problems

357
00:20:26,780 --> 00:20:29,880
which is arm the security

358
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:34,690
and and speed and sold my neck slides
are going to talk about that but before

359
00:20:34,690 --> 00:20:35,110
that

360
00:20:35,110 --> 00:20:38,130
I want to mention zag the up

361
00:20:38,130 --> 00:20:42,030
former team is that we are launching
today in conjunction with this

362
00:20:42,030 --> 00:20:42,850
conference

363
00:20:42,850 --> 00:20:46,240
I'm you is act that URL

364
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:49,690
over there I you don't need to remember
it

365
00:20:49,690 --> 00:20:52,940
I will have a blog post on their GFS
website

366
00:20:52,940 --> 00:20:56,860
sharply I which will have details

367
00:20:56,860 --> 00:21:01,130
%uh if you're subscribed to the effect
Twitter feed will be tweeting about it

368
00:21:01,130 --> 00:21:05,770
so on if you're interested you we
encourage you to download it

369
00:21:05,770 --> 00:21:10,360
and and try it out so

370
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:15,160
up what one explain like three goals
that are listed there for this car from

371
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:15,550
where

372
00:21:15,550 --> 00:21:20,120
starting a security and I put it up

373
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:25,340
on top there because I'm even though he
started with sharing

374
00:21:25,340 --> 00:21:28,590
we realized this was the biggest problem
that we needed to solve

375
00:21:28,590 --> 00:21:33,660
I the you know the the things that we
need to do for sharing a relatively

376
00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:37,040
small in comparison minutes this was a
huge problem that many people in

377
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:37,790
industry

378
00:21:37,790 --> 00:21:41,060
have flagged and it isn't really anybody

379
00:21:41,060 --> 00:21:44,950
up on with the solution today and so

380
00:21:44,950 --> 00:21:48,930
it's also the largest component of work
that we need to do NBC

381
00:21:48,930 --> 00:21:52,450
we see this as a multi year are
multi-decade effort

382
00:21:52,450 --> 00:21:56,260
do really I make this happen on so

383
00:21:56,260 --> 00:22:00,230
a basically such as solar routers that
obvious that

384
00:22:00,230 --> 00:22:03,300
you know most of you have in your home
are small office

385
00:22:03,300 --> 00:22:06,940
I hopelessly compromised and has been
documented

386
00:22:06,940 --> 00:22:10,800
for the course in the last year by many
security funds including

387
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:13,820
our partner a independent security
evaluators

388
00:22:13,820 --> 00:22:16,970
who read them few articles about it

389
00:22:16,970 --> 00:22:22,720
I'm and wanting the noticed was even
though they're published on Thursday

390
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:24,840
really wasn't much of a response

391
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:29,330
from manufacturing community there is
still shipping the same old things with

392
00:22:29,330 --> 00:22:29,770
the

393
00:22:29,770 --> 00:22:32,920
same or Linux kernels without the fixes

394
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:36,310
and with the same broken Feb user
interfaces

395
00:22:36,310 --> 00:22:40,280
and so on were

396
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:44,170
what we decide it is and you know since
a lot of the attacks

397
00:22:44,170 --> 00:22:48,470
do happen through the web UI that the
daughters

398
00:22:48,470 --> 00:22:52,540
exposed to users we will develop an
entirely new one

399
00:22:52,540 --> 00:22:55,710
I'm focused not only on security

400
00:22:55,710 --> 00:23:01,210
but also on simplicity because we wanted
to make it really easy for people to use

401
00:23:01,210 --> 00:23:04,630
and set up a wireless networks so

402
00:23:04,630 --> 00:23:08,700
that's that was the first part of the
initiative I mention that we're

403
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:12,870
collaborating with it in a min security
evaluators but we also

404
00:23:12,870 --> 00:23:16,010
%uh working wit other a

405
00:23:16,010 --> 00:23:20,240
people in the technology security
industry to help us

406
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:23,480
you know pen test Rd and improve

407
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:26,500
this router and

408
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:30,190
up what realized is one other reasons
that

409
00:23:30,190 --> 00:23:33,490
that our security so bad is that

410
00:23:33,490 --> 00:23:37,110
the suffered on that ours is not updated
I

411
00:23:37,110 --> 00:23:40,700
you know your your phone automatically
updated software your caps are

412
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:41,600
dramatically update

413
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:45,980
the car from there his is a fairly set
to do that

414
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:49,950
some other problems in the past where
about updates could bring problems

415
00:23:49,950 --> 00:23:50,830
because I've

416
00:23:50,830 --> 00:23:55,550
their limited memory footprint but today
they have plenty of memory you can have

417
00:23:55,550 --> 00:23:57,270
two copies of the images you can

418
00:23:57,270 --> 00:24:01,070
if you fail you can go back to the old
one so these are problems that can be

419
00:24:01,070 --> 00:24:02,100
solved today

420
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:05,110
but are not whitey solved and so

421
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:08,330
I the are focused on creating im

422
00:24:08,330 --> 00:24:12,560
secure about software update mechanism a
funny starters

423
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:15,640
which is not only up price acuity

424
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:20,890
by backing bucks blacked out we wanted
to add

425
00:24:20,890 --> 00:24:24,080
an additional protection because you
know of

426
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:28,340
are concerned with privacy were concerns
with overreach of government in in

427
00:24:28,340 --> 00:24:29,260
targeting

428
00:24:29,260 --> 00:24:34,410
individuals attacked the soccer up the
process itself could be

429
00:24:34,410 --> 00:24:39,260
way in which people could be spied upon
our the rights violated

430
00:24:39,260 --> 00:24:44,460
and so I am we decided that the way to
address this was to use tar

431
00:24:44,460 --> 00:24:47,929
which is you know as many of you know
was another project that came onto the

432
00:24:47,929 --> 00:24:48,990
FF

433
00:24:48,990 --> 00:24:52,030
I a are supported by the FF

434
00:24:52,030 --> 00:24:55,280
I a and we continue to support it

435
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:59,100
I yet and the purpose so that was

436
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:02,230
the router would fare will fetch I

437
00:25:02,230 --> 00:25:05,610
the information about what the most
current after is the major data

438
00:25:05,610 --> 00:25:10,120
that decides you know minutes it is
going update and worked there

439
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:14,419
filed that it needs to use to update is
or the car network

440
00:25:14,419 --> 00:25:17,419
and what this does is you know whatever
circular

441
00:25:17,419 --> 00:25:20,470
it is reaching out to %ah if there are

442
00:25:20,470 --> 00:25:24,600
intermediaries in between who can
intercept that traffic

443
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:28,050
they cannot know who it is that is
requesting

444
00:25:28,050 --> 00:25:32,140
this information this matter date
information and so

445
00:25:32,140 --> 00:25:36,800
in that case Effy will announce an end
you know what are the goals is to SEK

446
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:40,890
an example of how this can be done so
that other people can adopt this kind of

447
00:25:40,890 --> 00:25:41,760
practice

448
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:44,830
is then you know if if I

449
00:25:44,830 --> 00:25:48,370
you are I requested to push a malware

450
00:25:48,370 --> 00:25:52,890
to a particular user you can honestly
say we don't have a way to do that

451
00:25:52,890 --> 00:25:56,060
be the I there is no way in the system

452
00:25:56,060 --> 00:25:59,740
in which we can all that this is the
person you're trying to reach

453
00:25:59,740 --> 00:26:03,000
and the only way to send not going to
send it to everybody

454
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:07,169
and and when one does that it usually
defeats the

455
00:26:07,169 --> 00:26:10,710
the interest the government has because
then that bag

456
00:26:10,710 --> 00:26:14,080
madly will be I mean battery detective
may soon

457
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:17,250
and and so the there's no interest in
doing this

458
00:26:17,250 --> 00:26:20,890
so up in fact this mechanism than talk
about me

459
00:26:20,890 --> 00:26:25,679
haven't in our I suffer that we're
releasing today

460
00:26:25,679 --> 00:26:29,410
II and up we hope to make it

461
00:26:29,410 --> 00:26:33,929
more and more robust as going forward
and

462
00:26:33,929 --> 00:26:38,200
a re ira what are the

463
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:42,270
other aspects the security is being
actually able to change the software

464
00:26:42,270 --> 00:26:47,580
in case there is a problem up many
doubters use binary blobs

465
00:26:47,580 --> 00:26:51,540
which up you know can only be provided
by the manufacturer and

466
00:26:51,540 --> 00:26:55,470
up it creates two problems one is if
there's a problem the binary blob itself

467
00:26:55,470 --> 00:26:58,310
nobody can fix it except the
manufacturer who has no interest because

468
00:26:58,310 --> 00:26:59,550
there's no business

469
00:26:59,550 --> 00:27:03,310
in this low-end power segment to be
fixing these things the team that bill

470
00:27:03,310 --> 00:27:04,000
did

471
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:07,010
has a you know moved on and they're
doing

472
00:27:07,010 --> 00:27:11,640
more interesting more an immunity to
things and is not ready to do it

473
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:14,919
and and secondly I'm once you freeze

474
00:27:14,919 --> 00:27:18,820
a binary blob you freeze all the softer
around it so you cannot even upgrade

475
00:27:18,820 --> 00:27:22,910
the Linux kernel around it if you know
there were problems there

476
00:27:22,910 --> 00:27:26,300
soul you know it's very important to
have up

477
00:27:26,300 --> 00:27:30,490
suffered it can be completely built from
scratch so that we can

478
00:27:30,490 --> 00:27:34,580
fix problems and really do ownership of
the device

479
00:27:34,580 --> 00:27:38,679
back to the a homeowner and that they
are not beholden to anybody else

480
00:27:38,679 --> 00:27:41,720
and in this you know we agree with our
friends in the Free Software Foundation

481
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:43,510
who left also

482
00:27:43,510 --> 00:27:47,220
I have a I'm a about initiative

483
00:27:47,220 --> 00:27:52,900
and I encourage you to go and check that
out

484
00:27:52,900 --> 00:27:56,230
I so the second thing is speed and this
is

485
00:27:56,230 --> 00:27:59,450
on people

486
00:27:59,450 --> 00:28:02,720
Libya's to back in the mix as security
K-mart because people might say

487
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:06,120
he I don't want to happen open wireless
channel because maybe I'm exposing

488
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:07,760
myself to security problems

489
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:11,169
and I kinda skipped that part and men be
looking to that question what we

490
00:28:11,169 --> 00:28:12,530
realized loss

491
00:28:12,530 --> 00:28:15,790
you know doctors were hopelessly broken
independent of having to open

492
00:28:15,790 --> 00:28:18,990
awhile asap and so I mean I so this

493
00:28:18,990 --> 00:28:22,429
story with speed is something similar
you know people might see

494
00:28:22,429 --> 00:28:26,580
K you know what a baller when I want to
use the internet and you have a bunch of

495
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:30,240
you know a guess that are you know
downloading movies or something and I i

496
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:31,240
get a terrible

497
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:35,149
up experience and so

498
00:28:35,149 --> 00:28:38,770
up when we look into this a we realize
that

499
00:28:38,770 --> 00:28:42,340
independent of having an open wireless
network

500
00:28:42,340 --> 00:28:46,919
people had a terrible experience just if
they were the only users if they had

501
00:28:46,919 --> 00:28:50,870
I you know multiple applications may be
a bit browsing session may be wise

502
00:28:50,870 --> 00:28:54,169
maybe some large download happening
simultaneously typically

503
00:28:54,169 --> 00:28:58,320
the latency sensitive application the
Warriors our gaming

504
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:02,760
suffer significantly rebbe on what is
actually

505
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:07,190
I you know require and this is because
no problem carburetor

506
00:29:07,190 --> 00:29:11,409
where because memories cheap you know
buffers and devices have grown

507
00:29:11,409 --> 00:29:14,620
and back dance to up buffer up

508
00:29:14,620 --> 00:29:18,260
becuz of packets and then so the latency
sensitive applications

509
00:29:18,260 --> 00:29:21,260
are not getting the crumbs they want
they're not getting that priority that's

510
00:29:21,260 --> 00:29:22,179
needed

511
00:29:22,179 --> 00:29:25,330
and is a problem back to on

512
00:29:25,330 --> 00:29:28,679
few people in that community in fine art
at

513
00:29:28,679 --> 00:29:31,679
networking community and fine art a few
years ago

514
00:29:31,679 --> 00:29:35,030
and as a Project Kahn said a word I

515
00:29:35,030 --> 00:29:38,350
run by Dave dot and and Jim Gettys that
has been focused

516
00:29:38,350 --> 00:29:42,120
on up fixing this problem and

517
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:46,500
fortunately for us the at this point
after about three years

518
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:50,429
of research and implementation and bug
fixing

519
00:29:50,429 --> 00:29:53,880
the really at a point where their work
is is complete

520
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:58,020
it at least in some aspects and so we
are leveraging that

521
00:29:58,020 --> 00:30:01,929
and what that does is not only

522
00:30:01,929 --> 00:30:06,690
can be solved the problem of up having a
home user have a better user experience

523
00:30:06,690 --> 00:30:10,540
but those same algorithms they help us
share the Internet between the guest use

524
00:30:10,540 --> 00:30:11,890
in the host user

525
00:30:11,890 --> 00:30:16,480
in in a better way and so I 38 using
said a word for that

526
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:19,690
and then looking down into the future

527
00:30:19,690 --> 00:30:23,970
you know we want to make I ISP's live up
to their promise

528
00:30:23,970 --> 00:30:27,570
those numbers they give you when to sell
you the plans I

529
00:30:27,570 --> 00:30:32,130
and and so we are proud hoping to have
softer in there that will

530
00:30:32,130 --> 00:30:36,060
a measure up on a continuous basis you
know you can run speed test

531
00:30:36,060 --> 00:30:39,310
a one shot past but then you don't know
what's happening in the middle of the

532
00:30:39,310 --> 00:30:40,590
night are you don't know when

533
00:30:40,590 --> 00:30:44,010
you know what's happening and other
times that you make it about and

534
00:30:44,010 --> 00:30:48,190
you know having a router do these booze
testing has a lot of benefits so

535
00:30:48,190 --> 00:30:51,190
but we could have a continuous sample of

536
00:30:51,190 --> 00:30:54,630
you know what performance you're getting
and ensure the ISP the chart saying hey

537
00:30:54,630 --> 00:30:58,380
this is what I'm actually getting so you
wanna have backed that also helps with

538
00:30:58,380 --> 00:31:00,070
censorship because often

539
00:31:00,070 --> 00:31:03,630
censorship can be subtle if you make a
site's little

540
00:31:03,630 --> 00:31:06,640
it's probably as good as censorship for

541
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:09,690
a lot of purposes so and everyone had

542
00:31:09,690 --> 00:31:13,480
include that as well so those aspects
for speed and then

543
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:18,080
coming to sharing their we actually
started I

544
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:22,649
you know people care about up especially
internationally

545
00:31:22,649 --> 00:31:27,070
not exceeding a monthly bandwidth cap
that the ISP might have so the day

546
00:31:27,070 --> 00:31:29,580
they're happy to share the internet but
they don't want to be in a position to

547
00:31:29,580 --> 00:31:30,610
pay more

548
00:31:30,610 --> 00:31:34,060
and I and similarly the

549
00:31:34,060 --> 00:31:37,159
they care about their own in an
experience

550
00:31:37,159 --> 00:31:40,220
and so would be

551
00:31:40,220 --> 00:31:44,929
I including in the interface to this an
hour is a simple way

552
00:31:44,929 --> 00:31:48,280
far the hosts to send

553
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:52,669
banquet traction that the guest users
can get

554
00:31:52,669 --> 00:31:55,810
and I'm also an easy way to monitor

555
00:31:55,810 --> 00:32:00,060
how much cumulative data has been used
by the guest users so

556
00:32:00,060 --> 00:32:03,530
if your captors you know 300 gigabytes
or something you miss the okay I'm happy

557
00:32:03,530 --> 00:32:05,399
to give me 50 gigabytes

558
00:32:05,399 --> 00:32:09,350
and so we we keep track of that for you
and say okay not a frenetic seeded maybe

559
00:32:09,350 --> 00:32:10,350
you turn off

560
00:32:10,350 --> 00:32:14,270
your guest network so

561
00:32:14,270 --> 00:32:17,360
mall moving to the next line so where
are we

562
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:21,080
with with all these goals %ah then

563
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:24,450
so his daughter I'll we

564
00:32:24,450 --> 00:32:27,570
up decided we would hold back the
details until

565
00:32:27,570 --> 00:32:31,980
a this conference primarily to allow all
of you to

566
00:32:31,980 --> 00:32:35,490
by this model I because

567
00:32:35,490 --> 00:32:38,890
it is and order model of the router is a

568
00:32:38,890 --> 00:32:42,870
and next year up WND at 3800

569
00:32:42,870 --> 00:32:47,050
it's an 802 11 and router II it has been
very popular

570
00:32:47,050 --> 00:32:50,860
among hikers a very stable in a good
piece of hardware

571
00:32:50,860 --> 00:32:54,380
which supports completely open software
and

572
00:32:54,380 --> 00:32:58,540
up we chose that not only for those
reasons but that is also that all day on

573
00:32:58,540 --> 00:32:59,429
which the

574
00:32:59,429 --> 00:33:03,399
settler project has built and that is
the only daughter that the support

575
00:33:03,399 --> 00:33:06,460
so with me has use that

576
00:33:06,460 --> 00:33:09,830
and said a word itself as I mentioned
it's a

577
00:33:09,830 --> 00:33:13,050
it what it is and everybody will open
Word focused on

578
00:33:13,050 --> 00:33:16,790
starting research and the feedback their
stuff into mainline

579
00:33:16,790 --> 00:33:21,300
open Word and colonel and so we're using
that as the software base

580
00:33:21,300 --> 00:33:24,790
having said that i just want to see that
this crowded we're launching mid

581
00:33:24,790 --> 00:33:29,240
will not be the long-term problem that
we plan to support an order router

582
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:33,050
is much more powerful hardware that
allows us to many more interesting

583
00:33:33,050 --> 00:33:33,950
things

584
00:33:33,950 --> 00:33:37,530
that actually available but they were
not quite amenable

585
00:33:37,530 --> 00:33:41,200
in the schedule that we wanted so
removed

586
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:45,520
something like a dual-core on wanting
aksam processor

587
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:49,270
base new eyes in the future for a more
widespread

588
00:33:49,270 --> 00:33:55,340
distribution up this product

589
00:33:55,340 --> 00:34:01,290
okay so actually so on the can I request
you to do that wasn't

590
00:34:01,290 --> 00:34:04,820
you I would be happy to hatchery

591
00:34:04,820 --> 00:34:08,899
yes mentions answer you'd ever

592
00:34:08,899 --> 00:34:12,359
and battery were

593
00:34:12,359 --> 00:34:16,429
gonna demonstrate the web UI you guys
because

594
00:34:16,429 --> 00:34:21,889
I'm

595
00:34:21,889 --> 00:34:25,740
so small that

596
00:34:25,740 --> 00:34:28,760
great not married so this sucks

597
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:33,030
and okay so I and we wanted to make this
is

598
00:34:33,030 --> 00:34:36,760
easy as possible and as simple as
possible and

599
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:40,829
I could yet

600
00:34:40,829 --> 00:34:47,829
on mediation

601
00:34:49,899 --> 00:34:53,190
so what is showing is the scheme that
you'll see when you first install

602
00:34:53,190 --> 00:34:56,909
the the former and

603
00:34:56,909 --> 00:35:00,160
ill basically ask you to send you an
administrator password

604
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:04,970
you what everyone

605
00:35:04,970 --> 00:35:11,750
its Yemeni army character right now and
then ask you to set the

606
00:35:11,750 --> 00:35:14,960
network SSID for your private WiFi
network

607
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:18,670
so the on

608
00:35:18,670 --> 00:35:23,220
open wireless dark in our shared WiFi
network

609
00:35:23,220 --> 00:35:26,940
it has a fixed name as of now we know
not allowing that to be chain and

610
00:35:26,940 --> 00:35:27,410
that'll

611
00:35:27,410 --> 00:35:30,450
you'll see that going forward I'm

612
00:35:30,450 --> 00:35:34,480
and then at to explain why the past
raises not

613
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:37,690
masked okay

614
00:35:37,690 --> 00:35:41,099
so this in in the setup fees me

615
00:35:41,099 --> 00:35:44,619
we tacked on it would be a in a fairly
private

616
00:35:44,619 --> 00:35:47,910
environment and that it would help

617
00:35:47,910 --> 00:35:52,880
people do in terms of remembering NR are
you a morning it down somewhere to have

618
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:54,109
an ICB was a pool

619
00:35:54,109 --> 00:35:58,970
%uh men in the future you know people
actually log in using this administrator

620
00:35:58,970 --> 00:36:00,960
password we do not sure the password

621
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:04,210
place where

622
00:36:04,210 --> 00:36:10,510
oxman field

623
00:36:10,510 --> 00:36:13,109
and and that's it great like it's all
set up

624
00:36:13,109 --> 00:36:16,290
and and then this is that this is the
dashboard sale

625
00:36:16,290 --> 00:36:19,550
in I've right now it it whole show you

626
00:36:19,550 --> 00:36:22,990
okay this is connected to the Internet
and but

627
00:36:22,990 --> 00:36:26,400
you have your private WiFi network we
are a hoe I

628
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:29,500
you have your open wireless network that
you can toggle on/off

629
00:36:29,500 --> 00:36:32,990
I'm if you want and there's a setting

630
00:36:32,990 --> 00:36:35,990
down babies in unison and

631
00:36:35,990 --> 00:36:42,170
and their bench settings right you know
I

632
00:36:42,170 --> 00:36:46,260
three is it share so a first is

633
00:36:46,260 --> 00:36:51,170
you could change a password the main
sick 12 min security features we

634
00:36:51,170 --> 00:36:56,570
we decide will be useful here is on keep
the venue I fairly simple the number of

635
00:36:56,570 --> 00:36:57,730
things you can do

636
00:36:57,730 --> 00:37:01,490
are limited and for purpose and we
believe that

637
00:37:01,490 --> 00:37:05,050
its adequate for most people now if you
want to do more

638
00:37:05,050 --> 00:37:09,400
on dan we decided it will be through SSH
access

639
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:13,190
and far that we are now people to upload
their

640
00:37:13,190 --> 00:37:18,359
up SSH public key we did not want to
lock password access because again

641
00:37:18,359 --> 00:37:22,200
you know that's a that's a potential
attack and so

642
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:26,070
this I can you can click on that good

643
00:37:26,070 --> 00:37:30,830
could get his age enable so

644
00:37:30,830 --> 00:37:34,680
basically it brings up a window and you
can enter your public key and

645
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:37,680
and and Senate and it will be stored

646
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:41,260
I and once you complete

647
00:37:41,260 --> 00:37:47,119
the login up did there is no for their
upload possible to the web interface

648
00:37:47,119 --> 00:37:50,670
so what you have to SSH into the device
to pack more keys

649
00:37:50,670 --> 00:37:54,170
or change the key and I think that makes
it much

650
00:37:54,170 --> 00:37:58,700
more secure I'm and the next

651
00:37:58,700 --> 00:38:01,760
up did just little bit

652
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:04,920
for their I'm as one issues with
anything else there

653
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:08,119
okay so the

654
00:38:08,119 --> 00:38:13,810
ISP speech denied things that a require
users to enter to optimize

655
00:38:13,810 --> 00:38:17,660
the performances that are the queuing
algorithms that are in there

656
00:38:17,660 --> 00:38:21,000
that we got from said a word up

657
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:25,250
and you know you could do this to speed
estar you know maybe have

658
00:38:25,250 --> 00:38:29,660
a knowledge of a country and so you
can't upload and download speeds

659
00:38:29,660 --> 00:38:34,609
on the private wifi network you can you
know changed SSID

660
00:38:34,609 --> 00:38:37,720
you can see a unity the usual wifi
parameters or their

661
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:40,970
and as Nate mention we plan to support

662
00:38:40,970 --> 00:38:44,080
a a VPN to our for

663
00:38:44,080 --> 00:38:47,270
all of the traffic on that private
network up

664
00:38:47,270 --> 00:38:51,400
as well as on the open wireless right
now that's great out because it hasn't

665
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:52,359
been implemented yet

666
00:38:52,359 --> 00:38:56,030
I on open wireless the main feature as I
mentioned

667
00:38:56,030 --> 00:38:59,200
is the ability to send the band
retraction thank you

668
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:04,070
%uh will limit the guest users to and
and then

669
00:39:04,070 --> 00:39:10,020
I you can also said the maximum on you
know megabytes or gigabytes of data that

670
00:39:10,020 --> 00:39:13,660
you're willing to allow guess users to
use and

671
00:39:13,660 --> 00:39:16,700
what happens is if that number is
exceeded

672
00:39:16,700 --> 00:39:19,880
the open wireless industry's
automatically get switched off

673
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:23,480
and be looking into handing you know I'm
a Morcha

674
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:27,070
graceful mechanisms that may be talking
down I'm kind of stretch it out for the

675
00:39:27,070 --> 00:39:27,920
cause of the month

676
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:31,270
but right now to turn it off and then on

677
00:39:31,270 --> 00:39:34,970
and the be sent there has to be said the
counter

678
00:39:34,970 --> 00:39:39,650
on that in a monthly cap and then we
will also sup

679
00:39:39,650 --> 00:39:42,770
support in the futures in ascending
which day of the month

680
00:39:42,770 --> 00:39:46,380
you're using for that up and have an
auto reset

681
00:39:46,380 --> 00:39:49,640
Anna and then similarly the there

682
00:39:49,640 --> 00:39:54,280
in a wireless features fun back and then
there's one additional security feature

683
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:59,670
I'll for the open Wireless lot of the
criticism open wireless in the media

684
00:39:59,670 --> 00:40:02,940
which you know is somewhat misguided but
is it still

685
00:40:02,940 --> 00:40:06,940
a lot a lot that is I'm sent out there
about how

686
00:40:06,940 --> 00:40:10,869
using open wireless networks compromises
your security because somebody could

687
00:40:10,869 --> 00:40:12,030
sniff the traffic

688
00:40:12,030 --> 00:40:15,260
now the real solution for this and do
and security

689
00:40:15,260 --> 00:40:18,980
to issue DPS you know other solutions
because

690
00:40:18,980 --> 00:40:22,900
back gives you true security to all the
intermediate hops it's not just about

691
00:40:22,900 --> 00:40:26,280
the question of any security to the Next
Top the wifi router

692
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:29,339
bike since you know this is something
people are concerned about what about

693
00:40:29,339 --> 00:40:30,670
vacation still stuff

694
00:40:30,670 --> 00:40:34,740
send things in the clear on there's a

695
00:40:34,740 --> 00:40:38,190
mechanism to have secure open wireless
without

696
00:40:38,190 --> 00:40:42,740
up having I'm authentication and through
a mechanism car GPS

697
00:40:42,740 --> 00:40:49,740
and we will be supporting that as well
and that's it

698
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:57,540
so in summary you know this is a hacker
release that's why we're

699
00:40:57,540 --> 00:41:02,110
here at Whole to release it its DNA in
my

700
00:41:02,110 --> 00:41:06,580
I am don't argue that's beyond hot and
the purpose other leases really good

701
00:41:06,580 --> 00:41:07,810
drying delaware's

702
00:41:07,810 --> 00:41:11,760
and you made the project may develop a
friendly and I have to credit my

703
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:12,430
colleague

704
00:41:12,430 --> 00:41:15,430
Jake I'm here for for really

705
00:41:15,430 --> 00:41:19,510
fattening the project reusable dude you
know lovers

706
00:41:19,510 --> 00:41:22,630
and and that's our goal really to be
here the conference to

707
00:41:22,630 --> 00:41:25,870
bring you and in and get you and your

708
00:41:25,870 --> 00:41:29,980
and we can now really begin the process
of a hardening the security

709
00:41:29,980 --> 00:41:34,600
on the device and as I mentioned the
harder part from will change

710
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:37,980
so you know it is not an expensive
platform encourage you to buy it it's

711
00:41:37,980 --> 00:41:39,500
about fifty dollars a refurbished

712
00:41:39,500 --> 00:41:43,970
units are available on newegg but you
know it may change in the future

713
00:41:43,970 --> 00:41:47,130
and how can you help us all

714
00:41:47,130 --> 00:41:50,880
you know since security so important if
you have expertise in security

715
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:55,240
you can bend srt8 at the software it is
on get help

716
00:41:55,240 --> 00:41:59,580
I D be %uh the location will be
announced on the FF website are

717
00:41:59,580 --> 00:42:03,100
you can go to the download URL that I
I'm a

718
00:42:03,100 --> 00:42:08,170
pointed out earlier you can extended the
web UI is minimal you may want to do

719
00:42:08,170 --> 00:42:10,450
something different that may be featured
that's missing

720
00:42:10,450 --> 00:42:13,720
please suggestion added

721
00:42:13,720 --> 00:42:17,140
and and we'll be expecting people
request on the get have

722
00:42:17,140 --> 00:42:20,830
you can not their features that can be
added to open the BRT

723
00:42:20,830 --> 00:42:24,990
the the B is that we're using itself to
projects that I want to mention them

724
00:42:24,990 --> 00:42:25,850
really help

725
00:42:25,850 --> 00:42:30,300
is people want to know where these open
wireless access points are so you

726
00:42:30,300 --> 00:42:31,050
especially

727
00:42:31,050 --> 00:42:33,910
minutes most useful if you go to another
city and you want to connect so you

728
00:42:33,910 --> 00:42:34,810
wanna know where they are

729
00:42:34,810 --> 00:42:38,590
and some on the other systems you know
you might have heard of Honor

730
00:42:38,590 --> 00:42:43,220
in a Comcast Xfinity they trying to
provide this kinda maps even wanna views

731
00:42:43,220 --> 00:42:44,130
interested in

732
00:42:44,130 --> 00:42:48,470
trying to create a map and creating a
system where people can easily find out

733
00:42:48,470 --> 00:42:49,010
where to

734
00:42:49,010 --> 00:42:52,940
get these open well as access points you
know please come talk to me I think that

735
00:42:52,940 --> 00:42:55,000
would be an awesome project I

736
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:58,040
another is an open wireless ap and

737
00:42:58,040 --> 00:43:02,870
a instead of you know just how bad you
like that we have today and those

738
00:43:02,870 --> 00:43:06,140
some additional cool things that can be
done if we have absolute right and

739
00:43:06,140 --> 00:43:09,820
anti-u_s_ and if your decision that also
please please come talk to me

740
00:43:09,820 --> 00:43:13,270
and then in terms of deployment you know
that's where we can really

741
00:43:13,270 --> 00:43:18,210
use a lot of help is is that you know
organizing maybe neighborhoods where

742
00:43:18,210 --> 00:43:21,890
large number of people deployable
wireless is a great way

743
00:43:21,890 --> 00:43:25,760
do really make it useful rather than

744
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:30,330
just be scattered over a large area so
neighborhoods are your city or town

745
00:43:30,330 --> 00:43:33,600
wants to do it please contact us and we
will try to see what we can do to

746
00:43:33,600 --> 00:43:38,010
help make it happen in and

747
00:43:38,010 --> 00:43:42,070
and and that's that's that's the price
that we wanted to announcing talk about

748
00:43:42,070 --> 00:43:42,730
and we're

749
00:43:42,730 --> 00:43:45,840
would love to open it up to questions if
anybody has any you know

750
00:43:45,840 --> 00:43:52,840
11 minutes for every laments maybe on so

751
00:43:54,630 --> 00:43:58,560
yes well here today that he loves

752
00:43:58,560 --> 00:44:02,510
went I can't see any alright lovullo

753
00:44:02,510 --> 00:44:05,970
are using one ready or two radioman
ratings AP

754
00:44:05,970 --> 00:44:11,980
there too and you allow to be on the
same ban so there's a $5 you texted you

755
00:44:11,980 --> 00:44:12,810
and is it too late

756
00:44:12,810 --> 00:44:16,310
right okay so you have to have them
separate yeah is there any reason why

757
00:44:16,310 --> 00:44:18,130
you're not running multiple SSID

758
00:44:18,130 --> 00:44:22,350
a I didn't send a person like to possess
any meaning

759
00:44:22,350 --> 00:44:26,370
you can run more than once that
compartment them out in two different

760
00:44:26,370 --> 00:44:27,010
lands

761
00:44:27,010 --> 00:44:30,150
so we are we have multiple SSID

762
00:44:30,150 --> 00:44:34,330
it is open while in our guests idealized
I mean I know it's an open wrt I wrote

763
00:44:34,330 --> 00:44:36,030
the patent on it 1999

764
00:44:36,030 --> 00:44:43,030
but not both

765
00:44:43,500 --> 00:44:47,790
radios both sets once a real sparring
both radios in saint and

766
00:44:47,790 --> 00:44:51,010
bad if I have to explain it to your
non-starter

767
00:44:51,010 --> 00:44:54,380
from secondly

768
00:44:54,380 --> 00:44:59,310
israeli chance you're gonna use like the
in a sec to sign it is a ski so

769
00:44:59,310 --> 00:45:03,470
you don't have that you know I've never
seen the city

770
00:45:03,470 --> 00:45:07,520
it's the city before it has to change
you don't get the security

771
00:45:07,520 --> 00:45:10,730
morning re: everybody hit this room can
deal with that

772
00:45:10,730 --> 00:45:13,750
they know what they're doing pieces are
from the south homeowners

773
00:45:13,750 --> 00:45:18,310
do not know what that means right a
change message he also

774
00:45:18,310 --> 00:45:23,230
I can't login anymore because we get the
security warning but if you

775
00:45:23,230 --> 00:45:30,230
DNS sex sign it it works it's Peter
Eckersley article triggers

776
00:45:31,910 --> 00:45:35,520
K I I like the idea it's a great legal
hack

777
00:45:35,520 --> 00:45:39,600
I don't see what technology here but I
understand legal hack so

778
00:45:39,600 --> 00:45:43,300
so we will be able to support me in a
sec on here because settler

779
00:45:43,300 --> 00:45:46,750
you know one of the features that they
have unity day

780
00:45:46,750 --> 00:45:51,710
very you my love doing this with FreeBSD

781
00:45:51,710 --> 00:45:55,240
thanks if you if you want to help us do
that every day

782
00:45:55,240 --> 00:46:00,950
doing this the best black mamba climbing

783
00:46:00,950 --> 00:46:05,980
I I am wondered if you could speak to
the issue of

784
00:46:05,980 --> 00:46:09,110
Terms of Service with the majors

785
00:46:09,110 --> 00:46:13,030
his not allowing you to share it with

786
00:46:13,030 --> 00:46:17,400
not let me give is Courtney Love I see
you

787
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:20,780
alone

788
00:46:20,780 --> 00:46:26,740
also donors are aka but on

789
00:46:26,740 --> 00:46:31,290
Hayes so the main point is to upscale
multiple clients

790
00:46:31,290 --> 00:46:34,540
fear having the most are the same IP
address

791
00:46:34,540 --> 00:46:37,810
if I ever understand this correctly
wanna wanna break

792
00:46:37,810 --> 00:46:42,340
so the effort has done a really nice
research in the past on something called

793
00:46:42,340 --> 00:46:43,600
up enough to click

794
00:46:43,600 --> 00:46:46,830
which as a project that identifies a

795
00:46:46,830 --> 00:46:49,910
certain actors on the internet via
fingerprinting

796
00:46:49,910 --> 00:46:53,080
their web browser client a in various
ways

797
00:46:53,080 --> 00:46:56,210
and so your own research

798
00:46:56,210 --> 00:46:59,780
is actually pointing towards another
vector

799
00:46:59,780 --> 00:47:03,440
in which a user could be identified even
if they are sharing the same

800
00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:07,620
wireless connection so on and I'm not
saying this in order to take away from

801
00:47:07,620 --> 00:47:11,460
from this very promising project but I
think it would be interesting

802
00:47:11,460 --> 00:47:15,120
have you considered adding a proxy on

803
00:47:15,120 --> 00:47:18,680
or some sort of a DPI thing

804
00:47:18,680 --> 00:47:22,240
on on the router a level

805
00:47:22,240 --> 00:47:25,570
that would a make do some work to

806
00:47:25,570 --> 00:47:28,910
prevent the sort not to click style
edification

807
00:47:28,910 --> 00:47:33,580
clients on their social problems with
fruit

808
00:47:33,580 --> 00:47:37,960
use the word make it

809
00:47:37,960 --> 00:47:41,560
now very good the person activity

810
00:47:41,560 --> 00:47:44,910
to network just

811
00:47:44,910 --> 00:47:48,420
teacher up it's it's not

812
00:47:48,420 --> 00:47:51,580
things working out right now on one of
those so

813
00:47:51,580 --> 00:47:55,320
19 resist kinda not an optically which
is that many

814
00:47:55,320 --> 00:47:58,660
I if not most desktop web browsers

815
00:47:58,660 --> 00:48:02,970
are uniquely identifiable damn close to
it one-issue systematically

816
00:48:02,970 --> 00:48:07,810
though is something like this is not
particularly identified

817
00:48:07,810 --> 00:48:10,840
and that mobile is one of the use cases

818
00:48:10,840 --> 00:48:14,620
for a big marlins' onto yeah even though
you can fingerprint a desktop browser

819
00:48:14,620 --> 00:48:15,980
with quite a bit

820
00:48:15,980 --> 00:48:19,620
have with with many bitter entropy

821
00:48:19,620 --> 00:48:26,620
on fingerprinting a and I was for
Android devices all of her

822
00:48:52,150 --> 00:48:55,930
and one other point to the world's
project is that as as peter is

823
00:48:55,930 --> 00:49:01,770
were not manage middling your connection
open wireless as it exists right now

824
00:49:01,770 --> 00:49:04,970
at Cafe is at the hotel Pennsylvania
hotel they were staying

825
00:49:04,970 --> 00:49:09,579
%uh man in the middles your connection
great when you first contest

826
00:49:09,579 --> 00:49:13,190
that's a captive portal the capital
problem is really bad

827
00:49:13,190 --> 00:49:16,980
breaks law stuff it rains users to click

828
00:49:16,980 --> 00:49:20,829
artists the certificate stock

829
00:49:20,829 --> 00:49:24,220
%uh and we dome wanted to the open
wireless

830
00:49:24,220 --> 00:49:27,450
her project will mock actions

831
00:49:27,450 --> 00:49:30,650
either in a couple situation or TDI

832
00:49:30,650 --> 00:49:34,170
triggered pressure it's fun hottest

833
00:49:34,170 --> 00:49:39,260
on my question is a

834
00:49:39,260 --> 00:49:42,480
find my user you know this and

835
00:49:42,480 --> 00:49:47,480
I get a DMC notice about something I
know I did NOT download

836
00:49:47,480 --> 00:49:51,270
and that was to open things you say oh
there's a legal precedent for this

837
00:49:51,270 --> 00:49:54,339
so what's my next step

838
00:49:54,339 --> 00:49:57,829
and is that I'm not asking a personal

839
00:49:57,829 --> 00:50:00,950
legalized by something that's going to
help us and on

840
00:50:00,950 --> 00:50:04,290
is that practical a regular users have
you say

841
00:50:04,290 --> 00:50:08,200
ol write a letter to your demand letter
to your ISP you I mean like a something

842
00:50:08,200 --> 00:50:09,770
regular user can actually do

843
00:50:09,770 --> 00:50:14,950
pop the collar for it's probably
something have two colour for whenever

844
00:50:14,950 --> 00:50:18,700
you get to a loss her throat of a
lawsuit Kong lawyers want the

845
00:50:18,700 --> 00:50:22,309
stuff said I asked where would probably
recommend you do

846
00:50:22,309 --> 00:50:27,960
should have a lawyer on retainer using
yeah I mean should should all do you

847
00:50:27,960 --> 00:50:30,020
have a lawyer on retainer yeah it's
probably a good idea

848
00:50:30,020 --> 00:50:33,220
grant just in general whether using open
wireless or not

849
00:50:33,220 --> 00:50:37,079
I just need to increase the cost hole
Holland limit for lawyers

850
00:50:37,079 --> 00:50:41,329
million on but but there are

851
00:50:41,329 --> 00:50:44,430
it yes but maintains a list were city
this sir

852
00:50:44,430 --> 00:50:48,030
work said you know info at yet tough
tough words

853
00:50:48,030 --> 00:50:51,369
greeting on drizzly should have attitude
your fingers

854
00:50:51,369 --> 00:50:54,880
good as they have in like some form
things that people can be like if you go

855
00:50:54,880 --> 00:50:55,690
to the NCAA

856
00:50:55,690 --> 00:50:59,089
ears open wireless email form letter you
can send your ISP

857
00:50:59,089 --> 00:51:06,089
that's something that we might consider
yeah

858
00:51:25,220 --> 00:51:28,620
hehe I'm ma I and II

859
00:51:28,620 --> 00:51:33,830
buyer my question is OK juju maybe take
is already and through the night

860
00:51:33,830 --> 00:51:37,490
whose to condense to me or send me but

861
00:51:37,490 --> 00:51:41,090
chiefly but I have a user

862
00:51:41,090 --> 00:51:44,680
or here noah K I don't typically

863
00:51:44,680 --> 00:51:50,150
you to a few people were we keep but
very many people would go local or

864
00:51:50,150 --> 00:51:50,960
heedless

865
00:51:50,960 --> 00:51:55,310
said they click on Mon May I wouldn't go
to the barge pole

866
00:51:55,310 --> 00:52:00,170
and I end up in date it was a rootkit
virus is ur okay

867
00:52:00,170 --> 00:52:04,400
to government and I you know I die a you
know

868
00:52:04,400 --> 00:52:08,750
and you go the gavel hey you know who
your you

869
00:52:08,750 --> 00:52:12,620
be perfectly innocent he won't have been
trying to do

870
00:52:12,620 --> 00:52:17,950
ready day you know we you know shadier
anything like that

871
00:52:17,950 --> 00:52:21,340
but I and have to if about by

872
00:52:21,340 --> 00:52:25,890
by computer in jeopardy at you know and
I went through

873
00:52:25,890 --> 00:52:29,190
I i wonder about to chew a teachers like
that how

874
00:52:29,190 --> 00:52:33,670
you can't separate pretty Asian you know
you you should

875
00:52:33,670 --> 00:52:37,890
ish you use is that might be hurtful

876
00:52:37,890 --> 00:52:44,440
that I have no who Monday sure server
you know shadowy and K

877
00:52:44,440 --> 00:52:48,740
from the user it just clicked on Sunday

878
00:52:48,740 --> 00:52:53,910
dead you know he shouldn't have been I
end up with the debris

879
00:52:53,910 --> 00:52:56,910
there's like that how the networks are
partition

880
00:52:56,910 --> 00:53:00,570
yet still you know what are the reasons
to provide

881
00:53:00,570 --> 00:53:03,760
the VPN option are the car auction

882
00:53:03,760 --> 00:53:06,990
for more the private and the all 11

883
00:53:06,990 --> 00:53:10,530
is if you choose blessed to have a VPN
and a 1-1

884
00:53:10,530 --> 00:53:13,740
on your traffic would be completely
separate from

885
00:53:13,740 --> 00:53:16,770
the guest traffic so if he was doing
something

886
00:53:16,770 --> 00:53:20,080
you know that could potentially be
proper management law enforcement

887
00:53:20,080 --> 00:53:23,150
the whimsy that'll be that came from
different actors

888
00:53:23,150 --> 00:53:26,980
i'm talking about. get

889
00:53:26,980 --> 00:53:31,630
soul

890
00:53:31,630 --> 00:53:35,320
there shouldn't be any reason that
traffic from the open wireless

891
00:53:35,320 --> 00:53:40,580
is even getting into your network right
so there has been a separate there

892
00:53:40,580 --> 00:53:43,820
there is no way that tho

893
00:53:43,820 --> 00:53:49,860
to guest users anywhere to see devices
in your home I'm not

894
00:53:49,860 --> 00:53:53,020
up

895
00:53:53,020 --> 00:53:56,740
got

896
00:53:56,740 --> 00:54:00,740
that'll affect his computer but not
yours FAQ

897
00:54:00,740 --> 00:54:04,510
she's not here he just inches is going
to pass through the router the router

898
00:54:04,510 --> 00:54:06,590
has not only affected and unaffected

899
00:54:06,590 --> 00:54:09,920
and it differently affected you never
never gonna see it

900
00:54:09,920 --> 00:54:14,310
I'm we have time for one more question
but I wanna hear you guys have to say

901
00:54:14,310 --> 00:54:15,050
and

902
00:54:15,050 --> 00:54:19,270
at come come find a separate okay I'll
try to make it a good one and

903
00:54:19,270 --> 00:54:22,390
hands wanna know so this is a a tour
client

904
00:54:22,390 --> 00:54:25,930
have you considered at adding option for
toward

905
00:54:25,930 --> 00:54:29,210
and that our exit nodes to increase that
whenever with

906
00:54:29,210 --> 00:54:33,540
total so it would be really easy to do
that and you know

907
00:54:33,540 --> 00:54:37,280
be X from S's each axis you can't do
that

908
00:54:37,280 --> 00:54:40,560
because the car vanities in there you
can set it up through do that

909
00:54:40,560 --> 00:54:44,030
we want have it set up like that by
default because it uses up people's

910
00:54:44,030 --> 00:54:46,060
bandwidth and we want people to make the
choice

911
00:54:46,060 --> 00:54:50,030
to do that even make it easier for them
in in terms of exit node we're probably

912
00:54:50,030 --> 00:54:51,790
not gonna happen as an option

913
00:54:51,790 --> 00:54:55,140
on running it or exit node I did

914
00:54:55,140 --> 00:54:58,470
to talk project I'm benefits from

915
00:54:58,470 --> 00:55:01,760
from large low-latency high-bandwidth

916
00:55:01,760 --> 00:55:04,760
exit now it's running on real hardware

917
00:55:04,760 --> 00:55:08,020
on not so reverend on it yes all

918
00:55:08,020 --> 00:55:11,960
hun right a whole bunch really small
really slow to react

919
00:55:11,960 --> 00:55:16,880
nodes is the last thing towards it might
be good for participants

920
00:55:16,880 --> 00:55:21,120
its doesn't work with spike to you know
but it is probably good as

921
00:55:21,120 --> 00:55:24,960
as a bridge so you know if you are
traveling the morning outside the

922
00:55:24,960 --> 00:55:26,370
country and you want to forest

923
00:55:26,370 --> 00:55:29,480
of your own home network and then
Blackstar

924
00:55:29,480 --> 00:55:32,880
excuse for those kind of things on

925
00:55:32,880 --> 00:55:37,310
so as as artie said unfortunately this
is the last question that was the last

926
00:55:37,310 --> 00:55:38,440
election we can take

927
00:55:38,440 --> 00:55:41,840
on but in terms of coming in finding us
after

928
00:55:41,840 --> 00:55:45,490
yeah as having a speakeasy at a bar
called American whiskey which is like a

929
00:55:45,490 --> 00:55:46,590
block and a half away

930
00:55:46,590 --> 00:55:49,930
starting in four-minute missed four
minutes

931
00:55:49,930 --> 00:55:53,050
I and we will be there on drinks are not
on

932
00:55:53,050 --> 00:55:56,870

box

933
00:55:56,870 --> 00:56:01,960
