1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
thing outside the US whether it's
something as simple as

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,339
just checking in his report or something
a lot more sensitive you always make

3
00:00:06,339 --> 00:00:07,020
sure that you have

4
00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:10,349
autumn security sometimes just protect
from

5
00:00:10,349 --> 00:00:13,900
something embarrassing other times it
could be much more serious situation

6
00:00:13,900 --> 00:00:17,150
our next three speakers are here to
discuss

7
00:00:17,150 --> 00:00:20,189
using travel routers to increase your
security

8
00:00:20,189 --> 00:00:23,789
on the road you dr. Ryan Lackey mark
Rogers

9
00:00:23,789 --> 00:00:30,789
I

10
00:00:31,269 --> 00:00:35,090
thank you I'm Ryan Lackey I A worked in
crypto for a while

11
00:00:35,090 --> 00:00:39,329
I recently sold my company CloudFlare
and working on summer interesting

12
00:00:39,329 --> 00:00:43,440
security substance back when I was at
sea land and Haven co doing softer data

13
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:44,239
have been paying

14
00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:47,920
a while ago fifteen years ago and and
I'm

15
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:51,489
Rogers I'm are Rogers and I break stuff

16
00:00:51,489 --> 00:00:56,960
so we're gonna talk about using travel
routers to hide your traffic and safety

17
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:01,690
I am we're gonna go over basically our
why you wanna hide your information

18
00:01:01,690 --> 00:01:05,239
some principles of SAC we work a lot
with the crock whose really big into

19
00:01:05,239 --> 00:01:05,820
applying

20
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:10,210
I'm OPSEC to hacker tradecraft I we're
gonna show some

21
00:01:10,210 --> 00:01:13,409
pretty serious up sec fails and people
who got burned by them

22
00:01:13,409 --> 00:01:17,049
are somewhat the technical threats are
that you can face things that can be

23
00:01:17,049 --> 00:01:20,090
countered by outside things that require
more technical countermeasures

24
00:01:20,090 --> 00:01:23,500
some the existing tools and
countermeasures to those tools and then

25
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:25,090
we're gonna andrea's travel routers

26
00:01:25,090 --> 00:01:29,159
and how to use a travel router hide so

27
00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:32,380
probably don't need to really cheaper
too much time into a bit why do you

28
00:01:32,380 --> 00:01:33,170
really want to hide

29
00:01:33,170 --> 00:01:36,619
I am at a lotta reasons I have we seen

30
00:01:36,619 --> 00:01:40,990
last couple maybe lol to 30 months has
been very very clear

31
00:01:40,990 --> 00:01:45,850
that there are global monitoring systems
in place NSA GCHQ

32
00:01:45,850 --> 00:01:49,490
but don't forget about the old threats
China Russia

33
00:01:49,490 --> 00:01:52,490
also drug people monitoring a lot a
global traffic you don't wanna get

34
00:01:52,490 --> 00:01:53,880
flagged only special

35
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:56,930
like you really don't want special
treatment you wanna be completely a

36
00:01:56,930 --> 00:01:59,180
normal person that nobody really takes
interest in

37
00:01:59,180 --> 00:02:02,770
because the interest they taking you is
not usually very good and there's good

38
00:02:02,770 --> 00:02:03,399
reasons

39
00:02:03,399 --> 00:02:06,540
just Cara privacy like you don't really
want just personal like innate desire

40
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:07,380
for privacy

41
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:10,929
on you not necessarily somebody is doing
anything really a legal you're just

42
00:02:10,929 --> 00:02:11,349
sorta

43
00:02:11,349 --> 00:02:14,950
just a small person and you gotta
prevent some

44
00:02:14,950 --> 00:02:18,209
some basic threats you to prevent I V

45
00:02:18,209 --> 00:02:21,530
there's a lot there's a the principle
that you have a lot of individual things

46
00:02:21,530 --> 00:02:24,040
themselves not terribly sensitive but
you put them all in

47
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:27,800
together in one place a big database
that collection stuff is much more

48
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:29,760
sensitive than any of the individual
things

49
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:34,220
and a to be honest there are some times
in doing stuff where you really don't

50
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:37,530
want the monitor in specific where
you're doing something that might be

51
00:02:37,530 --> 00:02:40,709
legal under some people laws might be
high risk might get you in trouble

52
00:02:40,709 --> 00:02:42,099
people are very powerful

53
00:02:42,099 --> 00:02:45,940
I honored by passing things that are
totally arbitrary don't believe in

54
00:02:45,940 --> 00:02:50,690
I am you don't get it acted anyone to
make sure that if you do something and

55
00:02:50,690 --> 00:02:53,300
you don't recall you doing it doesn't
come back to burn you like twenty years

56
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:53,790
later

57
00:02:53,790 --> 00:02:58,860
so there's a whole lotta reasons why am
I wanna hide so as I said we work a lot

58
00:02:58,860 --> 00:02:59,810
with the crock

59
00:02:59,810 --> 00:03:03,970
I this guy who lives in in Thailand
right now in his pretty awesome actually

60
00:03:03,970 --> 00:03:04,890
he's

61
00:03:04,890 --> 00:03:09,190
studied up sexyy studies KGB studies I'm
also to other people's

62
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:13,340
sort of like operational trade craft
printable starting from

63
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:16,409
pretty much like the whole Cold War up
to now

64
00:03:16,409 --> 00:03:21,569
and he also the fan biggie smalls 10
crack commandments and convert it to the

65
00:03:21,569 --> 00:03:23,000
ten commandments of Artsakh

66
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,909
and they're here for you they're pretty
clear I make a lot of sense

67
00:03:26,909 --> 00:03:31,870
say should follow these and then the
question is what happened with this goes

68
00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:32,200
wrong

69
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:35,440
this is a sort a benign case went well
and goes wrong I know if anyone

70
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:38,190
remembers back in 1992 the US invaded
aim

71
00:03:38,190 --> 00:03:41,280
area a country in the CENTCOM area

72
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:44,549
turned out there was not a racket was
who somali in this case

73
00:03:44,549 --> 00:03:48,920
and they sent the marines in to invade
but apparently the journalists knew that

74
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:49,190
this

75
00:03:49,190 --> 00:03:52,709
the nation's gonna happen on this beach
at a certain time so there were like 200

76
00:03:52,709 --> 00:03:56,450
journalists on the beach with cameras
and regs everything intense all set up

77
00:03:56,450 --> 00:04:00,060
anybody's marines doing effectively
oppose landing into a punch press

78
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:04,049
us is pretty hilarious to watch the
whole thing yeah

79
00:04:04,049 --> 00:04:07,230
so and that's that's like the least bad
thing that happens when in this kinda

80
00:04:07,230 --> 00:04:08,480
stuff goes wrong

81
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:14,439
and Marco going to somebody's most

82
00:04:14,439 --> 00:04:17,630
motion the big boss that we've seen over
the last

83
00:04:17,630 --> 00:04:21,530
12-24 months have been because a basic
options

84
00:04:21,530 --> 00:04:25,610
so proud arguably the biggest

85
00:04:25,610 --> 00:04:28,910
trucks Bazaar am the

86
00:04:28,910 --> 00:04:32,350
paper the first major online drugs
bizarre

87
00:04:32,350 --> 00:04:37,270
1.2 billion dollars in transactions over
two years

88
00:04:37,270 --> 00:04:40,930
when you look up why Russell Rick was
busted

89
00:04:40,930 --> 00:04:44,330
it's pretty obvious he uses own gmail

90
00:04:44,330 --> 00:04:48,500
when he set up his first account an
account under the name holds a wide

91
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:51,990
he posted jobs for so proud to employ
people to

92
00:04:51,990 --> 00:04:57,800
build stuff under the account he
advertise an early version it's ok Road

93
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:00,810
under that account he

94
00:05:00,810 --> 00:05:03,930
obviously realize at some point he
needed to change things often that there

95
00:05:03,930 --> 00:05:05,310
was a risk so

96
00:05:05,310 --> 00:05:08,919
you then went on retrospectively change
that accounts

97
00:05:08,919 --> 00:05:13,090
to make an enormous he changed it to
frosty a frosty dot com

98
00:05:13,090 --> 00:05:17,810
pressure for Chicago com then went on to
become an admin its ok rodin was found

99
00:05:17,810 --> 00:05:19,710
in the cell protease

100
00:05:19,710 --> 00:05:23,150
he was rushing to post snippets of code

101
00:05:23,150 --> 00:05:26,729
to I'm Stack Overflow asking questions

102
00:05:26,729 --> 00:05:30,750
code that was later found in soap Road

103
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:34,830
you love the staff is really basic

104
00:05:34,830 --> 00:05:38,330
don't post things using your room name
don't

105
00:05:38,330 --> 00:05:42,310
don't use your email address don't don't
use your home address

106
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:46,060
and once you post something on the
internet don't think that you can grow

107
00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:47,530
and change it and deleted

108
00:05:47,530 --> 00:05:51,389
because months is on the Internet its
out there

109
00:05:51,389 --> 00:05:56,360
that's not how the internet works

110
00:05:56,360 --> 00:06:00,050
same thing he was shy boo chopper was
busted just

111
00:06:00,050 --> 00:06:04,330
to OPSEC failures sorry was careful some

112
00:06:04,330 --> 00:06:10,210
spend a lot of his time using tall your
sis been the longest time using IRC

113
00:06:10,210 --> 00:06:14,400
one time you've got to use tool logged
onto IRC

114
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:17,539
using his own details his home address

115
00:06:17,539 --> 00:06:22,169
does not in today's world there are
people

116
00:06:22,169 --> 00:06:26,699
wholesale collecting data just in case
the governments are storing vast amounts

117
00:06:26,699 --> 00:06:29,090
of information

118
00:06:29,090 --> 00:06:32,830
and they convert respectively minus so
that one time

119
00:06:32,830 --> 00:06:36,880
you log in using your own address is
gonna be there

120
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:41,199
and as they search back through history
building kit

121
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:44,789
the other failure was even more basic if
you gonna buy stolen

122
00:06:44,789 --> 00:06:49,199
unified parts for cars using stolen
credit cards

123
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:53,949
don't happen shipped to your home

124
00:06:53,949 --> 00:06:59,569
Moshe is the same deal they use personal
Facebook account to send defacement code

125
00:06:59,569 --> 00:07:02,849
the use their real names as the user
names

126
00:07:02,849 --> 00:07:06,590
the never compartmentalized estar

127
00:07:06,590 --> 00:07:09,710
you may be the really cool repack a

128
00:07:09,710 --> 00:07:12,759
but if you go and boast your coolly
hacker

129
00:07:12,759 --> 00:07:17,199
using your personal account someone's
going a little too

130
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:21,759
separate business and pleasure separate
your legal activities from illegal

131
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:23,949
activities

132
00:07:23,949 --> 00:07:28,360
and finally the jury's con around this
loss one mark-up Alice

133
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:31,639
are no everyone here thinks she's
innocents

134
00:07:31,639 --> 00:07:34,840
for these guilty but what I do know is

135
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:38,060
when he posted saying that mound docs
have been hacked

136
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:41,560
that had been taken down using the pic
when malleability attack

137
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:45,190
and that he only had two thousand big
points left

138
00:07:45,190 --> 00:07:48,319
I am a couple friends did some

139
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:52,099
very rudimentary tracing using some
accounts you used before

140
00:07:52,099 --> 00:07:55,699
and her friend if you remember when man
blocks had its solvency issues the year

141
00:07:55,699 --> 00:07:56,770
before

142
00:07:56,770 --> 00:08:00,120
mark Appel is moved around some cash to
show

143
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:04,620
the he was actually solvent what we did
was we went back and we looks

144
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:09,110
at the accounts that he'd move that cash
around two and

145
00:08:09,110 --> 00:08:13,479
look to see what happens. the cash and
what we found was it had been split

146
00:08:13,479 --> 00:08:17,560
and moved in some other counts those
other counts

147
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:20,569
help 90,000 bitcoins

148
00:08:20,569 --> 00:08:25,389
thats quite a bit larger than the 2000
back when she was claimed he had left

149
00:08:25,389 --> 00:08:29,150
and lo and behold when the accusation
was put to him

150
00:08:29,150 --> 00:08:32,709
he suddenly found another 200,000 pat
Quinn's the heat for gotten about an

151
00:08:32,709 --> 00:08:34,959
hour

152
00:08:34,959 --> 00:08:41,959
if you gonna steal money from people at
least be smart and try to wonder

153
00:08:43,550 --> 00:08:46,470
so what are the common mistakes and
vulnerabilities that we see that are

154
00:08:46,470 --> 00:08:48,380
certain common from all these things

155
00:08:48,380 --> 00:08:51,790
I mean of course that is the big threat
is always insiders either there's

156
00:08:51,790 --> 00:08:54,660
infiltration if your organization or
somebody gets turned

157
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:58,170
the bus somebody for some minor thing
and then you tell them oh you're gonna

158
00:08:58,170 --> 00:09:01,529
go away for two or three or four times
longer than you could ever possibly

159
00:09:01,529 --> 00:09:02,519
stand

160
00:09:02,519 --> 00:09:07,100
and a the they're all over pretty fast
sometimes people just make mistakes the

161
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:09,060
promise of sex you have to get it right

162
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:13,209
pretty much all the time perfectly and
that you make a minor mistake

163
00:09:13,209 --> 00:09:15,820
when you're up late at night or when
you're done a lot of stuff for something

164
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:16,880
other kid

165
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:21,070
and it's all gone it's not an
all-or-nothing thinking was on mister

166
00:09:21,070 --> 00:09:24,459
and there's data leakage just the the
promised people are collecting

167
00:09:24,459 --> 00:09:27,630
and organizations are collecting such
huge lines with data that it's no longer

168
00:09:27,630 --> 00:09:29,540
k so they have to be looking

169
00:09:29,540 --> 00:09:32,800
just at the right time when you mess up
they've got everything so if you mess up

170
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:33,700
one time

171
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:36,910
even if they don't catch it then the
look and I'll find

172
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:41,529
so there's also the wanna threats is
that people are gonna attack your

173
00:09:41,529 --> 00:09:44,600
equipment itself they're going to
investigate you they're gonna hold your

174
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:45,279
commitment

175
00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:49,330
will get remote access to equipment they
will look at dated 30 on the machine

176
00:09:49,330 --> 00:09:52,560
will see if you're using tutorial see if
there's any sort of temporary files are

177
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:53,700
over to topic that

178
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:57,290
there's the fact they're these global
pervasive passive adversaries that are

179
00:09:57,290 --> 00:09:58,700
monitoring every single thing

180
00:09:58,700 --> 00:10:02,959
so they can look at backbones they can
look at your local traffic they can look

181
00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:06,690
at the traffic on our outside the fact
that you might be connecting to servers

182
00:10:06,690 --> 00:10:07,100
that are

183
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:11,589
operated by people that her incomplete
cahoots with whoever your enemy is

184
00:10:11,589 --> 00:10:15,450
if you are connecting to a server in
some foreign country

185
00:10:15,450 --> 00:10:18,610
the government that country is totally
on board with the company's is much more

186
00:10:18,610 --> 00:10:19,920
likely to side with the

187
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:23,800
the organization serving the insiders
are like some internet freedom fighter

188
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:27,709
that's going after some infrastructure
and say syria by the Syrian government

189
00:10:27,709 --> 00:10:28,089
is

190
00:10:28,089 --> 00:10:32,019
is pretty much Syrian government Syrian
telco all those guys are all pretty much

191
00:10:32,019 --> 00:10:33,510
one organization

192
00:10:33,510 --> 00:10:37,220
um and you might be able to print model
around

193
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:41,370
resisting passive threats that that
works pretty well for you the problem is

194
00:10:41,370 --> 00:10:45,130
there's organizations like an essay that
are willing to do a whole range

195
00:10:45,130 --> 00:10:48,540
active plus passive attacks there's
things the whole quantum series OHV

196
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:52,880
the things that were in the to: playbook
are a combination of a very small active

197
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:53,990
attack combined with

198
00:10:53,990 --> 00:10:57,839
a passive attack and passive monitoring
others now where there was the attack

199
00:10:57,839 --> 00:11:02,370
where the the to run in router site that
work for insight was

200
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:05,709
a compromise was serving now where that
would attack specific versions of

201
00:11:05,709 --> 00:11:07,940
Mozilla in the ticket or browser bundle
up

202
00:11:07,940 --> 00:11:11,750
people and there's the fact that they go
after the security controls first they

203
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:12,510
remove your

204
00:11:12,510 --> 00:11:15,810
your protection first and then they can
I'm unmask and others of course the

205
00:11:15,810 --> 00:11:18,260
physical in banja little all those bit
pointing

206
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:21,670
transaction records decline being much
more anonymous than a lot after

207
00:11:21,670 --> 00:11:24,160
conventional financial system so

208
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:31,160
if you touch money at all usual usually
an audit trail as a very strong manager

209
00:11:32,310 --> 00:11:33,839
so

210
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:38,600
what are they looking for when someone
gets older your equipment for similar

211
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:39,569
gonna look for ways

212
00:11:39,569 --> 00:11:43,329
the low-hanging for they're looking for
network box content meta-data

213
00:11:43,329 --> 00:11:47,290
the reason it seems low hanging fruit

214
00:11:47,290 --> 00:11:50,850
is its really easy to collect

215
00:11:50,850 --> 00:11:53,990
you're generating meditator everytime
usual machine

216
00:11:53,990 --> 00:11:57,579
it's being stored on the phones is being
stolen laptops

217
00:11:57,579 --> 00:12:01,570
its data about data and it's seen as

218
00:12:01,570 --> 00:12:07,459
motorists who cares how many you buy
today to you since the man who cares

219
00:12:07,459 --> 00:12:12,069
about how many emails you sent who cares
about the

220
00:12:12,069 --> 00:12:15,670
two times the usual phone the times
racks are some accounts

221
00:12:15,670 --> 00:12:19,519
answer is they did be made

222
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:23,519
be quite surprising to you vast majority
meta-data

223
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:27,319
is in pretty even when using two devices
has been a part or

224
00:12:27,319 --> 00:12:30,850
for example about the iPhone and how
easy it is for more force mint

225
00:12:30,850 --> 00:12:36,810
to acquire forensic information North
most people have speculated things like

226
00:12:36,810 --> 00:12:38,509
now there's a four-room

227
00:12:38,509 --> 00:12:41,649
AppleScript on Apple has a back door

228
00:12:41,649 --> 00:12:46,269
real to use Apple has different levels
storage

229
00:12:46,269 --> 00:12:50,600
different things are stored in different
ways some stuff is stored plain text

230
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:52,380
even when the device in print

231
00:12:52,380 --> 00:12:56,000
because they don't see the need and

232
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:01,120
this method titles in country you can
access it with physical access device in

233
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:06,339
some special tricks from Apple no sweat
you don't need to break in the crypt

234
00:13:06,339 --> 00:13:11,529
can just pull it down what can you
collect from systems

235
00:13:11,529 --> 00:13:16,390
0 blisters huge

236
00:13:16,390 --> 00:13:21,110
the the list is huge and I think human
things should stand out is the vast

237
00:13:21,110 --> 00:13:21,769
majority

238
00:13:21,769 --> 00:13:25,500
is meditation this morning pretty is not
protected in any way

239
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:29,459
it's just there that was mean to say

240
00:13:29,459 --> 00:13:34,220
you can't control it and that's for the
park some other stalkers that you can

241
00:13:34,220 --> 00:13:35,029
control

242
00:13:35,029 --> 00:13:39,339
where you met today to raise if not the
creation of the meta-data

243
00:13:39,339 --> 00:13:45,680
and if you can't control where it is you
can limits people's access to it so

244
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:46,320
funds are

245
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:50,220
even worse in many roles the amount of
data

246
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:54,050
you can get just from the sim card in
your phone is is pretty staggering

247
00:13:54,050 --> 00:13:59,300
with access to a SIM card I can tell you
you're from number I can tell you which

248
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:00,440
network you using

249
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:03,940
I can tell you you called I can get
location information

250
00:14:03,940 --> 00:14:06,980
and get site for information I'm

251
00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:10,820
depending on the their SIM card if it's
one that's wonderful working from a

252
00:14:10,820 --> 00:14:14,850
an operator that doesn't have strong
crypto I can break

253
00:14:14,850 --> 00:14:20,670
and i can claim it

254
00:14:20,670 --> 00:14:23,730
so we're basically in the golden ages
signals intelligence

255
00:14:23,730 --> 00:14:26,710
the used to be is really hard thing that
was only directed against foreign

256
00:14:26,710 --> 00:14:28,460
governments and foreign militaries

257
00:14:28,460 --> 00:14:31,890
now it's kinda something you can you can
do yourself

258
00:14:31,890 --> 00:14:34,870
and worth it so easy for governments to
do the marginal cost for each additional

259
00:14:34,870 --> 00:14:36,290
target is so low

260
00:14:36,290 --> 00:14:41,040
that they can do it pretty much to
everybody I'm SSL still isn't pervasive

261
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:42,990
I'm actually working on some stuff
personally

262
00:14:42,990 --> 00:14:46,430
with some people to get SSL much more
widely deployed

263
00:14:46,430 --> 00:14:50,740
I am there's still like single-digit
percentages

264
00:14:50,740 --> 00:14:55,300
let this sink in over the last 12 months

265
00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:58,630
since no dues revelations Crippen
Kercher traffic

266
00:14:58,630 --> 00:15:02,740
has tripled if not quadrupled in volume
it's gone up

267
00:15:02,740 --> 00:15:09,740
from one 22 percent 26 percent more than
ninety percent of the world's traffic is

268
00:15:10,090 --> 00:15:10,860
coming printer

269
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:16,050
why and then Big Data an ex

270
00:15:16,050 --> 00:15:19,770
once you have on this date in one place
want to gather it used to be infeasible

271
00:15:19,770 --> 00:15:20,910
search now

272
00:15:20,910 --> 00:15:24,120
it's kinda something people do just to
target ads better so

273
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:31,120
easy for the government to do with even
more money and less profit ok

274
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:34,490
so there's some specific time
informations interesting about

275
00:15:34,490 --> 00:15:38,590
mongering IP networks which is something
I care a lot about IP networks

276
00:15:38,590 --> 00:15:42,520
are great using all the time but even if
the date is in cryptid

277
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:45,850
the you're sending you still have to
leave a lot about it is an essential

278
00:15:45,850 --> 00:15:47,720
routing information you just can't hide

279
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:51,480
there's the IP addresses source
destination ports

280
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:55,450
the sizes and patterns your flows
traffic type all this stuff is

281
00:15:55,450 --> 00:15:59,500
is essentially like part of the address
information you can get referrals not

282
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:02,340
working and then the content even if
it's on a cryptid

283
00:16:02,340 --> 00:16:05,350
is a lot of information you can gather
just from the the patterns 0

284
00:16:05,350 --> 00:16:12,350
pick up to date ever since the contends
that it sells

285
00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:16,930
obviously if you have access to cell
phone equipment

286
00:16:16,930 --> 00:16:21,430
you gonna get even more as somebody who
has access to the operator network

287
00:16:21,430 --> 00:16:26,999
you can get pretty much the keys to the
kingdom you have call time duration

288
00:16:26,999 --> 00:16:31,800
column call party you have a rough
location not necessarily precise message

289
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:32,620
transmitted

290
00:16:32,620 --> 00:16:35,910
although that is accessible with the
operators

291
00:16:35,910 --> 00:16:39,920
cooperation your data traffic a smash
traffic and four schools

292
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:45,269
over-the-air it's a little bit trickier
you can get the MZ

293
00:16:45,269 --> 00:16:48,209
everyone's heard about him two catchers
are being deployed everywhere at the

294
00:16:48,209 --> 00:16:51,160
moment what most people don't realize is

295
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:55,629
just how sensed the MZ years the
government resumes years

296
00:16:55,629 --> 00:16:59,019
on sense that mattered you don't need a
warrant to Caesar

297
00:16:59,019 --> 00:17:03,990
stingray devices are being deployed all
over the place verities the MZ

298
00:17:03,990 --> 00:17:07,490
is a unique identifiers attached users
are you a subscriber

299
00:17:07,490 --> 00:17:12,760
with the MZ I contract offer and it
doesn't take a lot of equipment to do

300
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:16,780
that a colleague of mine Christian
Padgett demonstrated jack on

301
00:17:16,780 --> 00:17:20,549
just for a few hundred dollars you can
build in NZ capture to track

302
00:17:20,549 --> 00:17:24,020
realities is actually it's actually got
even cheaper

303
00:17:24,020 --> 00:17:28,069
because now we have these things called
femtocells for femtocell

304
00:17:28,069 --> 00:17:32,770
is is a cell base station in a small box
it's the wifi router

305
00:17:32,770 --> 00:17:36,429
with them the tolkan network and these
things on

306
00:17:36,429 --> 00:17:41,480
I'm secure some skill not basket and if
you grew

307
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:45,740
I them to some of the more fun anyway
you have achieved him to capture

308
00:17:45,740 --> 00:17:49,059
in fact movement you have an active base
station

309
00:17:49,059 --> 00:17:53,049
something the previously viewed only by
for two hundred thousand dollars

310
00:17:53,049 --> 00:17:56,500
now you can buy at Walmart for about a
hundred dollars

311
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:59,960
what can you get with our

312
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:03,950
a man the middle well you get for
precise location you get data

313
00:18:03,950 --> 00:18:08,919
you get voice SMS traffic and you get to
substitute traffic with your own

314
00:18:08,919 --> 00:18:12,120
I means you can parse malicious payloads
to for

315
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:15,330
their browsing device image you can see
what the users doing

316
00:18:15,330 --> 00:18:19,960
you can listen to what we use a sack
pretty much as much as the operator in

317
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:21,590
fact I would argue

318
00:18:21,590 --> 00:18:24,990
more new operator because you have the
opportunity to do stuff

319
00:18:24,990 --> 00:18:31,990
the operator wouldn't do because of
legal constraints

320
00:18:32,679 --> 00:18:36,960
a couple years ago I went out to China
to take a look the deal what's going on

321
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:39,649
there in exactly what the Great Firewall
of China slide

322
00:18:39,649 --> 00:18:42,980
the Great Firewall China's kinda

323
00:18:42,980 --> 00:18:46,600
four times is not just one system is a
very distributed network

324
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:51,260
machines for interact with everybody in
anyone who's in China

325
00:18:51,260 --> 00:18:54,340
it does everything from blocking IP
addresses

326
00:18:54,340 --> 00:18:57,789
hijacking DNS requests not even ones in
China's

327
00:18:57,789 --> 00:19:01,909
few you come to close to Chinese IP
space they will substitute

328
00:19:01,909 --> 00:19:06,700
some West it filters by keyword: it does
deep packet inspection for plain text

329
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:08,190
looking for forbidden words

330
00:19:08,190 --> 00:19:11,570
also been strings and most recently in
now

331
00:19:11,570 --> 00:19:15,720
2011 it developed the ability to look
for tall

332
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:20,440
and what they did was they built a a
signature detection system

333
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:24,980
looked for the handshake the site 300
toward it and if they detected

334
00:19:24,980 --> 00:19:28,410
then actively scanned the IP address
they suspected

335
00:19:28,410 --> 00:19:31,920
and spoke to more to it and set up a a
one-hop

336
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:36,500
onion circuit to validate that this was
truly a

337
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:41,130
actual Bridgeport or no and then blocked
thats

338
00:19:41,130 --> 00:19:44,400
free advanced often a major setback for

339
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:50,330
people whom Marjorie my me

340
00:19:50,330 --> 00:19:55,550
so the good thing is you don't have to
rely on having perfect OPSEC 24/7 365

341
00:19:55,550 --> 00:19:58,770
to defend yourself they're actually some
tools out there that make things a lot

342
00:19:58,770 --> 00:20:00,180
easier we're gonna have a fight on

343
00:20:00,180 --> 00:20:03,470
unita besides um sir gonna have

344
00:20:03,470 --> 00:20:06,920
there's a buncha tools that will help
you to protect themselves are so many

345
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:09,990
things are just regular tools that
happen use versus other tools

346
00:20:09,990 --> 00:20:14,350
that are are just safer to use these
other tools that are

347
00:20:14,350 --> 00:20:17,940
that are not release a safe in the park
into a configuration but we can tweak

348
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:20,190
them with some new settings to make them
a lot safer

349
00:20:20,190 --> 00:20:23,670
and there's a buncha told the people
working on really for the past

350
00:20:23,670 --> 00:20:26,750
maybe fifteen years but especially in
past five or 10 years

351
00:20:26,750 --> 00:20:29,860
to sorting be intentionally hide
information

352
00:20:29,860 --> 00:20:33,120
and provide privacy not really high
content but also

353
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:37,240
provide anonymity I am met some great
things towards probably the

354
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:40,700
most successful today and a lot of other
good work and then we're introducing

355
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:42,110
some new tools that are suffering

356
00:20:42,110 --> 00:20:46,740
%uh to start with there's the tools that
are a little bit more privacy protecting

357
00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:50,330
by default there's some basic
characteristics that will make a troll

358
00:20:50,330 --> 00:20:54,230
I would say generally more privacy
protecting or at least amenable to

359
00:20:54,230 --> 00:20:54,910
privacy

360
00:20:54,910 --> 00:20:58,890
then than other tools message based
systems like email verses

361
00:20:58,890 --> 00:21:02,460
I'm chat or email verses live stream
things like that

362
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:05,510
are just generally much easier to secure
you can add latency

363
00:21:05,510 --> 00:21:09,340
one of the big attacks on all the
systems is you can correlate when

364
00:21:09,340 --> 00:21:11,350
someone's online when they're using the
traffic

365
00:21:11,350 --> 00:21:14,430
and when they're their traffic is
spiking on their local network link

366
00:21:14,430 --> 00:21:18,040
within a run no if he sent the email
there's less over

367
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:21,070
direct correlation especially got an
immediate systems you gonna peer to peer

368
00:21:21,070 --> 00:21:22,640
systems decentralized

369
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:26,570
you you don't have a single organization
that has everybody's records to go after

370
00:21:26,570 --> 00:21:30,080
legally or extra legally were illegally
I'm

371
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:33,690
and it's also why the corner so awesome
compared to a lot of the existing

372
00:21:33,690 --> 00:21:34,620
financial systems

373
00:21:34,620 --> 00:21:38,100
systems are just even if they're not
totally secure that despite a passably

374
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:40,490
encrypt everything like one of my
favorite things

375
00:21:40,490 --> 00:21:44,690
is how the lot of internet email finally
in 2014 is equiped

376
00:21:44,690 --> 00:21:48,170
not because the PGP which is an awesome
message based cryptosystem

377
00:21:48,170 --> 00:21:52,470
but because starkillers people to set up
their mail servers to passively encrypt

378
00:21:52,470 --> 00:21:54,160
traffic to go study mail servers

379
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:57,300
gmail does it for virtually everybody
they talk to accept I guess for ya

380
00:21:57,300 --> 00:22:00,470
still I everybody runs our own mail
server should do this

381
00:22:00,470 --> 00:22:04,500
it's not at all secure against an active
attacker because there's really nobody I

382
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:05,450
for anything

383
00:22:05,450 --> 00:22:08,790
but against the passive adversary is
great so that for example aware just

384
00:22:08,790 --> 00:22:12,160
sorta pervasive passive kinda weak
encryption helps you

385
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:15,920
and you can layer better systems on top
of it and then stuff for data and

386
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:17,580
executable code are distinct

387
00:22:17,580 --> 00:22:21,290
is really really important for a lot of
security and a lot other violations of

388
00:22:21,290 --> 00:22:21,850
privacy

389
00:22:21,850 --> 00:22:25,510
user data happen once a when security is
subverted by an active

390
00:22:25,510 --> 00:22:31,140
passive hybrid system so those are all
really important principles in general a

391
00:22:31,140 --> 00:22:33,740
one other things actually really awesome
that's what one of these

392
00:22:33,740 --> 00:22:36,800
sorta like accidental benefits that come
from something else

393
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:40,600
is that cheap hardware itself helps you
a lot if you have to worry about

394
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:43,690
securing your hardware so there's a
stint as a standard further DOD

395
00:22:43,690 --> 00:22:48,230
for like how you can declassify hard
drive essentially it is you physically

396
00:22:48,230 --> 00:22:51,460
destroy the hard drive we basically
completely given up on the ability to

397
00:22:51,460 --> 00:22:52,510
take a hard drive

398
00:22:52,510 --> 00:22:57,740
delete data from a securely and and
reuse that drive effectively run a

399
00:22:57,740 --> 00:22:58,340
thresher

400
00:22:58,340 --> 00:23:03,850
so the fact that military has crazy huge
budget like a hundred million dollars a

401
00:23:03,850 --> 00:23:07,050
year lets them do that with top-line
equipment I could never do that my

402
00:23:07,050 --> 00:23:07,870
personal equipment

403
00:23:07,870 --> 00:23:11,520
until now I can buy a laptop for like
two hundred dollars I can dedicate use

404
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:13,300
it for a couple weeks he's a couple
months

405
00:23:13,300 --> 00:23:16,790
and then once its served its purpose I
can get rid

406
00:23:16,790 --> 00:23:21,380
I'm disposable hardware look to dedicate
things task see you don't have to worry

407
00:23:21,380 --> 00:23:22,780
about how you securely

408
00:23:22,780 --> 00:23:26,810
I'm handle multiple projects in the same
machine one-time is by a couple server

409
00:23:26,810 --> 00:23:27,890
machines use those

410
00:23:27,890 --> 00:23:31,540
and phones are even cheaper than laptops
you can buy phones like pretty soon

411
00:23:31,540 --> 00:23:34,310
phones are gonna be included for free
with like cereal that Charlotte unlock

412
00:23:34,310 --> 00:23:36,650
phones but you can get a phone the smart
for now for like

413
00:23:36,650 --> 00:23:39,650
50 100 bucks for a reason so

414
00:23:39,650 --> 00:23:43,610
that's getting pretty crazy and then
there's a the

415
00:23:43,610 --> 00:23:46,320
the model running live systems on a
memory we're not actually writing

416
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:46,720
anything

417
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:50,120
just makes it a lot easier to to secure
stuff

418
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:56,400
never on the dis- it's never available
to anyone else attack one other problems

419
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:58,490
here is of course getting access is
hardware

420
00:23:58,490 --> 00:24:00,780
it doesn't do a whole lot a good if
you're leaving like a and network

421
00:24:00,780 --> 00:24:02,880
monitoring device in somebody's location

422
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:07,200
if it's got a serial number and a you
can trace where that thing was purchased

423
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:09,090
with your credit card chips your home
address

424
00:24:09,090 --> 00:24:12,400
so you wanna be able to buy hardware in
a non attributable way

425
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:16,460
on pick one is really awesome for this
as we saw with subbu

426
00:24:16,460 --> 00:24:19,910
there was a problem where he had some
stuff shippers houses shouldn't

427
00:24:19,910 --> 00:24:22,960
shippers house with pick one you've
course when a buyer

428
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:26,400
you let local bitcoins or something but
they believe that there's a myth

429
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:29,810
the big point is completely anonymous it
isn't because the

430
00:24:29,810 --> 00:24:33,470
for transaction measures public unless
you take steps

431
00:24:33,470 --> 00:24:37,530
to hide your transactions in the cloud
of other things going on

432
00:24:37,530 --> 00:24:40,690
it's actually not too hard to trace
what's going on but

433
00:24:40,690 --> 00:24:45,970
three on two years must actually
somebody like mark a militia taken his

434
00:24:45,970 --> 00:24:50,240
things right back when tom was proxies
the wall hydro transaction account upon

435
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:51,410
the transactions

436
00:24:51,410 --> 00:24:54,910
are accessible and available and their
relatively easy

437
00:24:54,910 --> 00:24:57,320
but you just have to think about what
you doing and understand the

438
00:24:57,320 --> 00:24:58,450
implications

439
00:24:58,450 --> 00:25:01,550
because if you run out after drawing

440
00:25:01,550 --> 00:25:04,680
five hundred dollars from a cashpoint
from your ATM rather

441
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:08,790
and on by yourself a phone for AT&T
don't have any illusions that's

442
00:25:08,790 --> 00:25:10,160
completely anonymous

443
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:15,100
is going to take them no more than a
couple days to trace the phone to you

444
00:25:15,100 --> 00:25:18,820
and then the other other third-party
this is their disposable account so you

445
00:25:18,820 --> 00:25:22,520
dedicated account wasn't single-pass you
don't run

446
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:25,990
your personal email and use that to
contact people for you were

447
00:25:25,990 --> 00:25:30,070
your hacking thing you chain systems it
also set up like that missus

448
00:25:30,070 --> 00:25:33,380
basically good good object principal the
problem is it's a bit have a pain to

449
00:25:33,380 --> 00:25:38,510
manage all this kinda stuff

450
00:25:38,510 --> 00:25:41,690
there's also BBN technologies so BP and
the kinda near and dear to my heart

451
00:25:41,690 --> 00:25:42,320
because

452
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:46,190
Iran a VPN provider for I'll a lot of
last year

453
00:25:46,190 --> 00:25:49,530
and we shut down after the love a bit
fiasco

454
00:25:49,530 --> 00:25:53,750
because a some security issues that were
some legal policy issues it became very

455
00:25:53,750 --> 00:25:54,800
apparent

456
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:59,610
I'm but do you got as his age he got
better free VPN services you can use

457
00:25:59,610 --> 00:26:03,320
commercial services that are falling to
like almost zero dollars in cost

458
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:07,150
and it occurs when you're on the piano
I'm the problem is they're not really

459
00:26:07,150 --> 00:26:11,440
terribly good for anonymity there
they're really not an idiot all

460
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:15,360
I am you can use them to support in any
system but on their own they're not at

461
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:16,520
all anonymous

462
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:20,090
the night and and some other on by
really sketchy people that like to log

463
00:26:20,090 --> 00:26:22,380
all your traffic and yours is about
stuff to you

464
00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:27,230
um and a lot on my block like I've been
trying to get Chinese

465
00:26:27,230 --> 00:26:30,530
users to connect to something in its own
a cat and mouse game

466
00:26:30,530 --> 00:26:33,640
and then the the economic data like

467
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:36,850
if you got a VPN for some air traffic
but not all your traffic often that

468
00:26:36,850 --> 00:26:40,240
traffic that goes around the VPN it's
really interesting

469
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:43,930
its own same as with the burn a fun
don't fool yourself into thinking that

470
00:26:43,930 --> 00:26:46,350
you can buy vpn service for the credit
card

471
00:26:46,350 --> 00:26:50,710
and then go and use a VPN service to do
illegal things because

472
00:26:50,710 --> 00:26:54,070
I come on really the same thing is

473
00:26:54,070 --> 00:26:57,460
the more public service service right
that is the less likely that it's gonna

474
00:26:57,460 --> 00:26:58,840
fly under the radar

475
00:26:58,840 --> 00:27:03,440
so few your purpose is to find a service
is going to allow you to punch through

476
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:05,010
some 100 national farm

477
00:27:05,010 --> 00:27:08,710
such the Great Firewall then public VPN
services

478
00:27:08,710 --> 00:27:12,570
probably on going to help you because
their notes are being shot down

479
00:27:12,570 --> 00:27:16,060
almost as fast as I sent my mom

480
00:27:16,060 --> 00:27:20,390
so what are the best tools out there
today news is tore

481
00:27:20,390 --> 00:27:24,520
correctly used it will keep you in on us
believe

482
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:28,010
at least until it is yet another and its
it has some

483
00:27:28,010 --> 00:27:30,940
it generally works I use it it's it's a
great tool but it's got some

484
00:27:30,940 --> 00:27:31,800
disadvantages

485
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:35,020
its easy to block if you know the
signature I am

486
00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:38,030
lot of people looking at it because the
really interesting academic project as

487
00:27:38,030 --> 00:27:39,420
well as the

488
00:27:39,420 --> 00:27:42,550
a useful tool not terribly performant

489
00:27:42,550 --> 00:27:46,770
and I it's pretty complex so there's a
lot of potential for her

490
00:27:46,770 --> 00:27:50,030
especially if you run it on your local
computer with all your sensitive data on

491
00:27:50,030 --> 00:27:54,510
it dedicated not dedicated to the task

492
00:27:54,510 --> 00:27:58,570
I DPI an active network and now so they
are the greatest enemy other

493
00:27:58,570 --> 00:28:02,850
and luckily the door community has a law
degree developers that are working on

494
00:28:02,850 --> 00:28:03,840
ways to

495
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:07,660
to mitigate these disadvantages the best
thing is actually to run

496
00:28:07,660 --> 00:28:12,140
like former transforming encryption to
for pluggable transports to change the

497
00:28:12,140 --> 00:28:15,700
way that poor traffic looks to the
outside world as it as a transit

498
00:28:15,700 --> 00:28:18,910
they've been working on this for think
three or four years now

499
00:28:18,910 --> 00:28:22,950
at least and its it's it's pretty
effective and we're gonna go into

500
00:28:22,950 --> 00:28:26,610
to what what the Tor project realized is
that

501
00:28:26,610 --> 00:28:31,610
we're in a world where we have access to
tools that can analyze big data

502
00:28:31,610 --> 00:28:36,560
we can now take a huge lots of data and
look for signatures patterns

503
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:41,000
we can look for ways to her Act review
talk to services and in these things

504
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:45,530
and that means that for our traffic to
stay hidden in this trying cloud

505
00:28:45,530 --> 00:28:48,800
has to become a moving target we have to
come up with ways either

506
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:52,420
to hide the tree in the forest we have
to come up with ways to make sure

507
00:28:52,420 --> 00:28:56,500
trees consciously changing shape so that
when they look at its a push into played

508
00:28:56,500 --> 00:28:58,290
across mount another tree

509
00:28:58,290 --> 00:29:01,740
now it's a bush and that we know will
compare it down and track

510
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:05,380
a mass whether card will transport
concept is fantastic

511
00:29:05,380 --> 00:29:08,780
because is dynamic and you can loan
different models

512
00:29:08,780 --> 00:29:12,410
right now the seven large part will
transport you can use which'll

513
00:29:12,410 --> 00:29:15,960
there's a BFS proxy as fresh proxy

come in large obvious for power is

518
00:29:30,090 --> 00:29:33,940

with no plan to expand its

522
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:45,470
by stripping out the project headers you
remove the opportunity for

523
00:29:45,470 --> 00:29:49,540
signage action it's just random data
they see makes it very difficult for

524
00:29:49,540 --> 00:29:51,040
them to say

525
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:55,950
this is anything it just looks like
noise

526
00:29:55,950 --> 00:30:00,030

the difference between

coming flash function as a creation
utilization very sudden short-lived

541
00:30:48,510 --> 00:30:51,560
JavaScript responses they don't do much
to try and hide

542
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:56,270
but they set up in a way you can just
crater clower browsers

543
00:30:56,270 --> 00:30:59,860
and have them just crater flush network
very quickly

544
00:30:59,860 --> 00:31:03,610
put it rapidly doesn't matter who gets
round because

545
00:31:03,610 --> 00:31:07,380
hope for you used by then the couple
other one a new ones can come up was

546
00:31:07,380 --> 00:31:11,740
cost as old ones are taken down

547
00:31:11,740 --> 00:31:16,430
former transforming pictures my favorite
is in College Station wave

548
00:31:16,430 --> 00:31:19,530
matches in Arbor tree regular expression
the RD areas

549
00:31:19,530 --> 00:31:23,990
they've looked how much the century
systems automatically identify traffic

550
00:31:23,990 --> 00:31:28,510
attribute it to truck traffic moshe time
it's just a regular expression

551
00:31:28,510 --> 00:31:31,540
looks for particular bite sequences much

552
00:31:31,540 --> 00:31:35,930
particular keywords and the map its
various things

553
00:31:35,930 --> 00:31:39,460
so the example you can see below is

554
00:31:39,460 --> 00:31:44,620
they've been coded 32 traffic so it
looks like section

555
00:31:44,620 --> 00:31:48,300
it's not perfect it doesn't stand up to
manual scrutiny

556
00:31:48,300 --> 00:31:51,560
but it does for automatic systems and

557
00:31:51,560 --> 00:31:55,630
again the day we know that manual
inspection

558
00:31:55,630 --> 00:31:59,740
there's traffic is too expensive they
can't afford to manually inspector

559
00:31:59,740 --> 00:32:03,780
survey rely on their automated systems
like things are interest

560
00:32:03,780 --> 00:32:08,350
and real injury social long as you can
do something keeps you on the radio

561
00:32:08,350 --> 00:32:12,150
them which the manual manual inspection
it doesn't matter if it doesn't stand up

562
00:32:12,150 --> 00:32:14,190
to management

563
00:32:14,190 --> 00:32:17,640
and what are the disadvantages the
attacker is that those automated systems

564
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:21,670
have to run incredibly fast they're
running on 10 Gigabit Ethernet links

565
00:32:21,670 --> 00:32:26,560
multiple links and they can add too much
latency a system that be reliable and

566
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:27,430
everything else

567
00:32:27,430 --> 00:32:30,890
I work in a a high speed proxy that
needs to do the same kind of thing

568
00:32:30,890 --> 00:32:34,370
and we worry about microseconds so you
really don't have a lot of processing

569
00:32:34,370 --> 00:32:37,020
time to do this kind of pattern matching

570
00:32:37,020 --> 00:32:41,360
ideas you weaken with the russians lies
in Who's Who

571
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:44,960
up one lost 1i I particularly like the
Nana from

572
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:48,690
what number does is it takes very
military

573
00:32:48,690 --> 00:32:52,600
contractor library keywords and it uses
that

574
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:56,230
to disguise it as something that
resembles natural language again

575
00:32:56,230 --> 00:32:59,950
if you look at it he doesn't stand up to
man scrutiny

576
00:32:59,950 --> 00:33:04,510
but when it comes to a.m. automatic
detection

577
00:33:04,510 --> 00:33:08,340
it's going to be very hard for the
system to track

578
00:33:08,340 --> 00:33:11,690
and there's an expansion factor forces
and efficiency but

579
00:33:11,690 --> 00:33:15,200
again you've got really fast thanks now
because stuff is so cheap video stream

580
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:16,010
your devices

581
00:33:16,010 --> 00:33:22,220
so you can afford a hundred time
expansion factor you're sending text

582
00:33:22,220 --> 00:33:25,920
so absolute or world there are still a
bunch of great tools are some that have

583
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:27,080
been around since

584
00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:31,600
think 1998 was when the intestinal was
was proposed on bike track

585
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:35,950
actually remember I and position at the
tunnel is very solar systems that

586
00:33:35,950 --> 00:33:39,750
effectively tunnel one kinda traffic in
other Contracting the idea being that

587
00:33:39,750 --> 00:33:42,540
well do you know someone as a couple
herbs unicycles also so you don't have

588
00:33:42,540 --> 00:33:43,180
to

589
00:33:43,180 --> 00:33:46,480
pay for an earlier tell you can bypass
the a authentication thing

590
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:49,890
but also means that the ass traffic is
usually very suspicious so people to let

591
00:33:49,890 --> 00:33:50,800
it go by

592
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:55,030
and then HTTP traffic is also not
usually suspiciously psycho

593
00:33:55,030 --> 00:34:00,020
22 obvious limitations with both these
is you have to have servers that speak

594
00:34:00,020 --> 00:34:03,730
particles ready and waiting to catch a
connection

595
00:34:03,730 --> 00:34:06,630
man means you have two hundred pre set
everything up and have the instructor

596
00:34:06,630 --> 00:34:07,270
waiting

597
00:34:07,270 --> 00:34:12,360
I'm if it shows you set me up singer his
shop infrastructure for yourself

598
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:15,520
you can guarantee that is going to get
flagged eventually annexed

599
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:18,669
are in a blister on forever the big
adventure Tories

600
00:34:18,669 --> 00:34:22,090
there's a network ready proxies growing

601
00:34:22,090 --> 00:34:26,120
all the time there to connect your
session

602
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:30,270
others even worse if you try to use a
commercial provider that ran one IP for

603
00:34:30,270 --> 00:34:32,510
DNS tunneling something with a bunch of
people using it

604
00:34:32,510 --> 00:34:36,020
ever get shut down very short

605
00:34:36,020 --> 00:34:39,350
so the problem we see on here is is that
there's really no silver role in all

606
00:34:39,350 --> 00:34:40,530
this stuff is hard

607
00:34:40,530 --> 00:34:43,210
is a bunch of incremental things will
you be smaller than it is the hard to

608
00:34:43,210 --> 00:34:44,180
use

609
00:34:44,180 --> 00:34:47,230
and if you screw up there's a lot about
stuff that happens to you

610
00:34:47,230 --> 00:34:50,300
I might have your photo taken on the
beach which is one thing about bad

611
00:34:50,300 --> 00:34:51,050
happen you

612
00:34:51,050 --> 00:34:55,450
but the ZMC catchers and I me I'm
wondering I'm it's how we target drones

613
00:34:55,450 --> 00:34:56,080
to

614
00:34:56,080 --> 00:34:59,510
shoot missiles at the sky to people that
are driving on the cars

615
00:34:59,510 --> 00:35:03,230
so you use some people really don't
wanna be located um

616
00:35:03,230 --> 00:35:06,340
so it only takes one mistake to score a
and

617
00:35:06,340 --> 00:35:10,000
it's really hard for humans to not make
mistakes is however really easy for

618
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,830
computers to only make the same mistake
over and over again not make new

619
00:35:12,830 --> 00:35:13,740
mistakes each time

620
00:35:13,740 --> 00:35:17,000
so there and we think there's an
opportunity to use software tools to

621
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:17,770
sort automate

622
00:35:17,770 --> 00:35:21,350
the matter process here promised one the

623
00:35:21,350 --> 00:35:25,410
the ideas behind the concept is we can
solve all the problems

624
00:35:25,410 --> 00:35:28,690
X you gonna end up the system so complex

625
00:35:28,690 --> 00:35:33,170
by the time you you created some part of
its gonna be obsolete in

626
00:35:33,170 --> 00:35:37,190
worthy but what we figure is me a min
the low-hanging fruit

627
00:35:37,190 --> 00:35:41,550
stuff that there is tools and technology
for example much more out there sold

628
00:35:41,550 --> 00:35:44,650
you console fifty or sixty percent to
the problem

629
00:35:44,650 --> 00:35:48,130
reducing the meta-data man how's to
spend the rest

630
00:35:48,130 --> 00:35:52,820
time focus all your energy on the
remaining section

631
00:35:52,820 --> 00:35:56,520
which means there's less chance a
mistake you not gonna make a mistake in

632
00:35:56,520 --> 00:35:58,710
the business being done automatically

633
00:35:58,710 --> 00:36:02,030
and hopefully you can put some
additional effort into ensuring the

634
00:36:02,030 --> 00:36:06,010
doo-doo is done

635
00:36:06,010 --> 00:36:09,100
so we thought about this seven working
on this since

636
00:36:09,100 --> 00:36:13,480
kinda October 2010 and thinking about
and talking with Mark talking with

637
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:16,090
rock in a few other people trying to
figure out what the best approach to

638
00:36:16,090 --> 00:36:17,140
solve this is

639
00:36:17,140 --> 00:36:20,510
arm everyone's moving the cloud for
everything but this one other things we

640
00:36:20,510 --> 00:36:23,850
actually can't use the cloud is your
only solution because

641
00:36:23,850 --> 00:36:26,680
what will you connect to and it's the
whole monitoring from so doesn't make

642
00:36:26,680 --> 00:36:27,490
any sense

643
00:36:27,490 --> 00:36:31,370
client software too long like 2014 it's
still a pain in the right class offer

644
00:36:31,370 --> 00:36:32,830
even for one platform

645
00:36:32,830 --> 00:36:36,880
but if I wrote something only work on
like FreeBSD people would complain is no

646
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:39,310
Linux version is no matter in the
Windows version

647
00:36:39,310 --> 00:36:41,850
and then trying to keep something you're
actively developing in sync and all

648
00:36:41,850 --> 00:36:43,100
these platforms is usually

649
00:36:43,100 --> 00:36:46,319
plus you use an iPhone Android um

650
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:49,180
you have to get approval from the solar
walled garden to be able to play

651
00:36:49,180 --> 00:36:50,280
software

652
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:53,370
pgp is an effective sweet

653
00:36:53,370 --> 00:36:56,390
use it right effectively encryption
friction

654
00:36:56,390 --> 00:36:59,700
yet its adoption rate terror

655
00:36:59,700 --> 00:37:03,330
most places the only reason its users
because it's mandated

656
00:37:03,330 --> 00:37:06,840
various companies and six you have to
use the policy

657
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:10,350
how many you know people who aren't in
our community long

658
00:37:10,350 --> 00:37:13,890
weeks use pgp

659
00:37:13,890 --> 00:37:17,670
almost no wine because there's an
overhead in getting this thing said

660
00:37:17,670 --> 00:37:18,330
often

661
00:37:18,330 --> 00:37:22,859
managing music I actually my day job
with himself from business

662
00:37:22,859 --> 00:37:26,859
we did a survey much longer on really
simple security measure

663
00:37:26,859 --> 00:37:30,280
pink OTC for how many people do you
think

664
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:35,859
implement pinkerton your answers roughly
50 percent

665
00:37:35,859 --> 00:37:39,490
the reason given number one reason is 42

666
00:37:39,490 --> 00:37:43,580
four-digit pin is to difficult to manage

667
00:37:43,580 --> 00:37:46,450
so there's cool stuff like that your
browser bundle should have the same

668
00:37:46,450 --> 00:37:47,000
problem

669
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:50,260
client software and some the most secure
systems we have right now

670
00:37:50,260 --> 00:37:54,000
RVM or bootable image systems like tails

671
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:58,000
they work pretty well still a pain to
have to run the aum's on your system

672
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:01,750
everything else if you use different
roles inside to be an to Kanchi

673
00:38:01,750 --> 00:38:05,600
and it doesn't work a mobile phones or
tablets there's bill surprisingly is no

674
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:07,810
great virtualization system for mobile
phones

675
00:38:07,810 --> 00:38:11,950
I'm really surprised by that but doesn't
exist yet and

676
00:38:11,950 --> 00:38:15,100
either option is to use dedicated
disposable hardware so you got your work

677
00:38:15,100 --> 00:38:18,290
laptop your personal laptop your secret
project laptop your

678
00:38:18,290 --> 00:38:21,760
other malware announces laptop and
pretty soon you're not gonna be

679
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:25,270
like carrying stuff around with you and
what happens if you're out you only have

680
00:38:25,270 --> 00:38:26,200
one of your laptops

681
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:29,960
use other up is something it's just then
they can to find a guy who's carrying

682
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:31,050
five laptops &

683
00:38:31,050 --> 00:38:35,000
become so it's not really is a great so
we thought about it and

684
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:39,570
arm thought what is a small device that
you wanna have for some other benefits

685
00:38:39,570 --> 00:38:42,680
that you carry around with you we could
carry around with you everywhere

686
00:38:42,680 --> 00:38:46,110
that will actually be able to run all
the software all these tools

687
00:38:46,110 --> 00:38:50,560
on the device and we thought that a
custom secure travel router is actually

688
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:51,900
this week's all the stuff

689
00:38:51,900 --> 00:38:55,350
admitting it's a lot of the
disadvantages the stuff and is an easy

690
00:38:55,350 --> 00:38:56,110
way to

691
00:38:56,110 --> 00:39:03,110
to deploy these tools the reason is from
Ross's great the super cheap remember

692
00:39:04,420 --> 00:39:05,570
when travel routers

693
00:39:05,570 --> 00:39:10,010
something that was about the size of a
hardback book and it cost a couple

694
00:39:10,010 --> 00:39:10,820
hundred dollars

695
00:39:10,820 --> 00:39:14,740
now non-binding routers from tp-link for
about twenty different

696
00:39:14,740 --> 00:39:19,540
twenty-five dollars which run Linux
future fashion which have

697
00:39:19,540 --> 00:39:25,060
the hardware features mark one to take
advantage of to do some people use these

698
00:39:25,060 --> 00:39:27,400
when they go to hotels and they want to
share their

699
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:30,470
network with their cell phone there can
dole their tablet

700
00:39:30,470 --> 00:39:34,440
their like wife's computer their
computer always like five or six devices

701
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:38,970
and i get charged for mac address by the
teller per connection or if they want to

702
00:39:38,970 --> 00:39:42,520
have no a cell phone connection then
share the vision devices is actually

703
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:44,050
pretty good reasons to use these things
that are

704
00:39:44,050 --> 00:39:47,260
totally unrelated the Securities other
that's why they're so cheap they're not

705
00:39:47,260 --> 00:39:48,390
a security product

706
00:39:48,390 --> 00:39:52,200
they re save you money on paying for
WiFi hotels

707
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:55,780
and make easier to connect product so
they're really price-sensitive they made

708
00:39:55,780 --> 00:39:56,370
by these

709
00:39:56,370 --> 00:39:59,810
the chinese companies that make them
super cheap I'm

710
00:39:59,810 --> 00:40:03,830
and their they're everywhere a course
the other advantages

711
00:40:03,830 --> 00:40:07,070
if you gonna you something as a hardware
security products and you're gonna take

712
00:40:07,070 --> 00:40:07,620
into

713
00:40:07,620 --> 00:40:12,100
hot zones like for example China you
don't wanna security program screen

714
00:40:12,100 --> 00:40:13,180
security product

715
00:40:13,180 --> 00:40:16,720
because if you take out something but
looks like a smart tool

716
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:20,330
you set up a new hotel room be pretty
much guarantee you're gonna get a visit

717
00:40:20,330 --> 00:40:21,930
from the plae within a few minutes

718
00:40:21,930 --> 00:40:26,130
using some the almost every other
business travel has

719
00:40:26,130 --> 00:40:29,950
at least looks like something every
other business programs and stands up to

720
00:40:29,950 --> 00:40:30,270
some

721
00:40:30,270 --> 00:40:34,330
reasonable scrutiny is a massive
advantage the other advantage for us is

722
00:40:34,330 --> 00:40:36,280
that they're actually really easy to
program for

723
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:41,260
their system-on-chip their linux-based
there's often wrt the studio wrt

724
00:40:41,260 --> 00:40:44,000
the really simple the work they're not
as simple as like general purpose

725
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:44,490
computer

726
00:40:44,490 --> 00:40:47,470
they're still pretty simple to work with
you can't release of host the

727
00:40:47,470 --> 00:40:51,280
development violent but if you're
familiar with hardly knows and with them

728
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:54,530
raspberry PIs and things like that then
it's pretty easy as balls

729
00:40:54,530 --> 00:40:57,940
so

730
00:40:57,940 --> 00:41:01,420
we want the only people who ever came up
with this idea there's actually several

731
00:41:01,420 --> 00:41:02,470
projects myspace

732
00:41:02,470 --> 00:41:06,770
I'm course there's the Pogoplug which is
sort of like a plugin Wallwork

733
00:41:06,770 --> 00:41:10,680
kinda company that used to be for sure
USB drives they come up with something

734
00:41:10,680 --> 00:41:12,560
called the safe plug which is a

735
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:16,660
I a device that's not really portable
design for home network connection

736
00:41:16,660 --> 00:41:20,370
Iran's basic tore doesn't Michael
transport is pretty basic

737
00:41:20,370 --> 00:41:23,510
I've never actually seen one in person
there's the onion pie which

738
00:41:23,510 --> 00:41:27,400
a different which is awesome new
york-based hardware hacker company has

739
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:31,500
it's really a Raspberry Pi possible to
move stuff and as far as I can tell it

740
00:41:31,500 --> 00:41:32,070
as much

741
00:41:32,070 --> 00:41:35,160
a learning tool for people to will
expand with the Raspberry Pi do a

742
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:36,010
practical thing

743
00:41:36,010 --> 00:41:39,080
as it is a finished product but it's
pretty awesome told very configure we

744
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:41,640
should totally check it out and owners
portal which

745
00:41:41,640 --> 00:41:45,490
the crop this is awesome actor came up
with pic 2011 was when he started

746
00:41:45,490 --> 00:41:47,240
working on it may be a little bit before

747
00:41:47,240 --> 00:41:50,890
on basically it's he started out

748
00:41:50,890 --> 00:41:53,890
really focused on tour and pluggable
transports

749
00:41:53,890 --> 00:41:57,490
and when I found out this thing exists
on the internet and mail them and I

750
00:41:57,490 --> 00:42:01,350
met up with him a couple times and talk
with them about it he does

751
00:42:01,350 --> 00:42:04,350
a lot of what I want and it's a lot
harder than I want but it doesn't really

752
00:42:04,350 --> 00:42:05,210
have all the tools

753
00:42:05,210 --> 00:42:08,800
so he was limited and has been with
doesn't work on it also we

754
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:12,180
work on it together great but didn't do
enough so

755
00:42:12,180 --> 00:42:17,230
we had to and now so

756
00:42:17,230 --> 00:42:20,950
we've been working on it for a while
it's basically dedicated hardware

757
00:42:20,950 --> 00:42:24,330
its Qualcomm Atheros AR 9331 chipset

758
00:42:24,330 --> 00:42:27,740
with 64 mag the RAM and 16 megs around

759
00:42:27,740 --> 00:42:32,130
a pretty low-end computers appointed
megahertz likeness 24k

760
00:42:32,130 --> 00:42:36,180
but for for what we need it's it's
pretty awesome we've got some images for

761
00:42:36,180 --> 00:42:39,870
it's got even at ports USB ports the
idea is that it has multiple network

762
00:42:39,870 --> 00:42:42,720
interfaces summer which are on the high
side or the

763
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:46,070
the I'm Bionic up inside the the raw
data side

764
00:42:46,070 --> 00:42:49,770
some which are on the public side where
only increase the traffic is going

765
00:42:49,770 --> 00:42:53,810
see can keep a separate in the device
itself got a USB ports you can plug in a

766
00:42:53,810 --> 00:42:57,690
a 3G or 4G modem the cool thing when you
go to china is you can actually buy

767
00:42:57,690 --> 00:43:02,740
or ranch a a whereby a cheap USB modem
plus like a week a service like twenty

768
00:43:02,740 --> 00:43:03,870
dollars so

769
00:43:03,870 --> 00:43:06,820
instead of worrying about roaming sailor
founded by one of those things plug it

770
00:43:06,820 --> 00:43:08,370
in use

771
00:43:08,370 --> 00:43:12,380
IP services for everything and rather
than just working with tort self

772
00:43:12,380 --> 00:43:15,600
we added a lot of other transforms and
tools to it so

773
00:43:15,600 --> 00:43:19,530
yet we gotta go we for make it
manageable everything else

774
00:43:19,530 --> 00:43:22,610
the idea behind it is to take with the
flexibility

775
00:43:22,610 --> 00:43:26,040
and simplicity for travel router the
power

776
00:43:26,040 --> 00:43:29,880
have some like tall portable transport
and to make it really easy to use

777
00:43:29,880 --> 00:43:34,160
so you can simply go in said are choose
which transports you want to use

778
00:43:34,160 --> 00:43:37,170
enable and run them the most importantly

779
00:43:37,170 --> 00:43:40,560
some English pretty simple and gives you
a very

780
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:44,430
visual confirmation that it's
functioning and is doing was posted in

781
00:43:44,430 --> 00:43:48,020
there is one of the biggest issues I
have with doors sometimes a circular

782
00:43:48,020 --> 00:43:48,670
down

783
00:43:48,670 --> 00:43:52,040
fully realizing it you actually sending
stuff out the browser

784
00:43:52,040 --> 00:43:55,850
and this morning pretty special you can
check it by going in checking your

785
00:43:55,850 --> 00:43:59,290
your IP addresses singers from the tall
ones but

786
00:43:59,290 --> 00:44:03,060
out years it's not hard to make it to
does that and have a track you

787
00:44:03,060 --> 00:44:06,640
the moment something goes wrong and the
nice thing about having a physicals

788
00:44:06,640 --> 00:44:10,450
physically separate device is really
easy to conceptually understand it's

789
00:44:10,450 --> 00:44:11,360
really hard for me this

790
00:44:11,360 --> 00:44:14,440
to understand what a piece of urs doing
went on a machine

791
00:44:14,440 --> 00:44:17,620
especially if its running like Mac or
Windows or something I don't really

792
00:44:17,620 --> 00:44:20,890
understand every piece of running
machines all sorts of the contract

793
00:44:20,890 --> 00:44:24,370
two piece of hardware that only connects
by one cable people the cable

794
00:44:24,370 --> 00:44:27,610
not connected so that's that's a very
simple principle

795
00:44:27,610 --> 00:44:31,140
and I i did some defense contracting I
saw how the government's I double stuff

796
00:44:31,140 --> 00:44:31,790
works

797
00:44:31,790 --> 00:44:35,470
the rely extensively on hard worker they
don't worry about

798
00:44:35,470 --> 00:44:39,160
us saw for models everything to the
extent possible all Harbor models

799
00:44:39,160 --> 00:44:40,440
visible cables

800
00:44:40,440 --> 00:44:43,550
easy tracking there were no serial
numbers tracing everything

801
00:44:43,550 --> 00:44:47,690
much much simpler way to operate that
when your environment senior high stress

802
00:44:47,690 --> 00:44:51,940
war lot to users may be some users are
quite a smart is like other users

803
00:44:51,940 --> 00:44:56,180
and something can go wrong will go wrong
you make sure the tools are simple to

804
00:44:56,180 --> 00:45:00,880
use as possible

805
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:05,030
so them today monitoring is pervasive
it's here to stay

806
00:45:05,030 --> 00:45:08,070
we can do a lot to change ur we can
ensure Omar

807
00:45:08,070 --> 00:45:11,820
applications using encryption transport
our cans

808
00:45:11,820 --> 00:45:14,940
with initial were you changed vs time

809
00:45:14,940 --> 00:45:19,290
reality is only six percent to traffic
is using as a cell

810
00:45:19,290 --> 00:45:23,359
I'm its only gonna

811
00:45:23,359 --> 00:45:26,470
like 5 percent the last 12 months

812
00:45:26,470 --> 00:45:30,490
it's not going to change radically so we
need to take radical steps to protect

813
00:45:30,490 --> 00:45:31,730
ourselves

814
00:45:31,730 --> 00:45:35,020
because they are down on train

815
00:45:35,020 --> 00:45:38,220
and whether you want to protect your
privacy because you're

816
00:45:38,220 --> 00:45:41,870
just an ordinary user who was ritual:
don't flagged in

817
00:45:41,870 --> 00:45:45,210
traffics in spied on whether you're
someone who's doing high risk activities

818
00:45:45,210 --> 00:45:47,550
most a sec

819
00:45:47,550 --> 00:45:51,180
extraordinary steps need to be taken

820
00:45:51,180 --> 00:45:58,180
so we've got some boards yeah

821
00:45:58,320 --> 00:46:01,450
not quite ready for damage bonus is
kinda to a bit pointless to

822
00:46:01,450 --> 00:46:04,720
to show and tell from this this distance
from the sizer from but

823
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:09,460
but circles their

824
00:46:09,460 --> 00:46:14,250
is a cheap commodity boards the systems
that they will not will not be expensive

825
00:46:14,250 --> 00:46:17,420
you'll be able to use whatever hardware
toll Open Source offers so

826
00:46:17,420 --> 00:46:21,250
it'll be because there's no way to trust
the closer's piece of Ricky PC

827
00:46:21,250 --> 00:46:26,760
staffing and I'll be easy love the music
things I I did over

828
00:46:26,760 --> 00:46:30,890
the weekends prime with the sharks I've
talked in a a

829
00:46:30,890 --> 00:46:34,510
GSM board and activated my own little

830
00:46:34,510 --> 00:46:38,550
space station running BTS and founder

831
00:46:38,550 --> 00:46:41,770
actually I can run quite a secure
telephone network

832
00:46:41,770 --> 00:46:47,260
I'm the only downside is is obviously
very legal is a downside to

833
00:46:47,260 --> 00:46:54,260
educational purposes only

834
00:46:55,060 --> 00:47:01,840
I will be happy to take questions

835
00:47:01,840 --> 00:47:08,840
I no comment

836
00:47:09,329 --> 00:47:13,240
yes we will

837
00:47:13,240 --> 00:47:20,240
Twitter at octal follow up with a
location

838
00:47:21,490 --> 00:47:28,490
thank you very much

839
00:47:56,420 --> 00:47:57,680
serb a Twitter dot com

840
00:47:57,680 --> 00:48:04,680
slash octal octa al for the slide deck

841
00:48:09,480 --> 00:48:12,430
one more thing tonight will be coming up
shortly

842
00:48:12,430 --> 00:48:17,820
just a friendly reminder you know it's
very easy to lose track of time when

843
00:48:17,820 --> 00:48:18,230
you're in

844
00:48:18,230 --> 00:48:21,810
when you know these events is just a
little help remind folks

845
00:48:21,810 --> 00:48:25,350
something we've read kinda figured out
after twenty years

846
00:48:25,350 --> 00:48:28,540
doing these events help maximize your
experience here

847
00:48:28,540 --> 00:48:32,020
an imaginary tonight the R&R

848
00:48:32,020 --> 00:48:35,510
mention this a few times during these
events pretty me these times a day

849
00:48:35,510 --> 00:48:39,020
a good way to make sure to check the
best rate possible

850
00:48:39,020 --> 00:48:42,940
521 is something we've been saying a few
times you arm

851
00:48:42,940 --> 00:48:46,290
had the best rates possible we highly
recommend make sure they each day at

852
00:48:46,290 --> 00:48:47,210
five hours sleep

853
00:48:47,210 --> 00:48:54,210
two square meals one shower

854
00:54:16,350 --> 00:54:18,370
0

855
00:54:18,370 --> 00:54:25,370
mom

856
00:54:26,220 --> 00:54:30,440
my I

857

mmm

858
00:54:32,930 --> 00:54:39,930
the always pays off

859
00:55:07,940 --> 00:55:14,940
but

860
00:56:58,180 --> 00:57:05,180
have no voice scream

861
00:57:18,040 --> 00:57:24,400
wrap things up today perceive hope
descent is our theme this conference

862
00:57:24,400 --> 00:57:29,240
and well this is one vision of what
might happen if we fail

863
00:57:29,240 --> 00:57:33,680
in our mission and to bring us that
vision

864
00:57:33,680 --> 00:57:38,510
well

865
00:57:38,510 --> 00:57:42,320

became save I can say because I do not
germans rowing with I can't speak

876
00:58:22,650 --> 00:58:24,250
without completely but earn it

877
00:58:24,250 --> 00:58:27,510
alright cell everyone had

878
00:58:27,510 --> 00:58:32,410
before with we begin the movie high
