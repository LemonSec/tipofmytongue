1
00:00:01,750 --> 00:00:03,429
her horny

2
00:00:03,429 --> 00:00:07,049
New York thank you for staying follow
what I think is the Los

3
00:00:07,049 --> 00:00:11,509
on closing ceremony talk the conference
I had an awesome weekend

4
00:00:11,509 --> 00:00:18,109
I hope you guys have cheer I am here to
talk about it FF project

5
00:00:18,109 --> 00:00:21,300
that is dealing with a different kind of
surveillance

6
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:25,130
from the kind we've been talking about a
lot this weekend

7
00:00:25,130 --> 00:00:28,220
course if that works on government
surveillance defending against

8
00:00:28,220 --> 00:00:29,269
wiretapping

9
00:00:29,269 --> 00:00:32,800
but today I'm here to talk about the
actual

10
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:36,190
designs nature love the web hypertext

11
00:00:36,190 --> 00:00:40,300
the fact that its spying on us for the
time and this time

12
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:45,510
to do something about that so we have
this project out that we launch in alpha

13
00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:46,460
a few months ago her

14
00:00:46,460 --> 00:00:51,100
actually tomorrow morning we're going to
be going BSA you guys get a preview

15
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:54,210
I love the new cool features and stuff
that we're doing two Mar

16
00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:58,050
a.m. in this little program called
privacy badge I want you all to remember

17
00:00:58,050 --> 00:00:59,170
that URL

18
00:00:59,170 --> 00:01:02,539
it's really easy to remember %uh you can
install this thing

19
00:01:02,539 --> 00:01:05,939
a during a talk of the talk coming out
during the talk is your

20
00:01:05,939 --> 00:01:08,510
you'll get distracted and you tell me
about the bugs in the software and I

21
00:01:08,510 --> 00:01:09,560
don't know about them until

22
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:13,080
afterwards home you can file isohunt get
home

23
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:16,770
but a you know I'm not just talking
about Privacy Manager in this piece of

24
00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:17,479
software

25
00:01:17,479 --> 00:01:21,030
am actually telling a story I think
about that the architecture the web and

26
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:22,570
the architecture hypertext

27
00:01:22,570 --> 00:01:27,659
and the way the privacy does or doesn't
fit into that so if you go back to the

28
00:01:27,659 --> 00:01:29,220
days before the web

29
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:32,320
we enjoyed 'em a thing that we

30
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:35,549
we often take for granted which was the
right to read in private

31
00:01:35,549 --> 00:01:39,400
you can walk into a library and walk
between this tax

32
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:43,570
and pull out a book and start reading it
and unless there was someone cute

33
00:01:43,570 --> 00:01:44,420
further up the

34
00:01:44,420 --> 00:01:47,460
the aisle looking at here watching what
you're doing

35
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:51,780
for the most part no one would know or
what you charge to read

36
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:55,450
you can walk into a bookstore and
purchase the book

37
00:01:55,450 --> 00:02:00,530
in cash a the person at the checkout
calibration know everywhere anyway

38
00:02:00,530 --> 00:02:03,939
I'm you could take that back home put it
on your bed

39
00:02:03,939 --> 00:02:06,969
and no one would know our that you are
reading about

40
00:02:06,969 --> 00:02:10,550
whatever it was ac is a more Islam a.m.

41
00:02:10,550 --> 00:02:15,319
or secretly your conservative and you
didn't want anyone to know that home

42
00:02:15,319 --> 00:02:18,860
today that right is gone

43
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:22,250
a if you choose to read

44
00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:25,560
anything using the modern media freeing

45
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:29,260
we invented the web up the chance
chances are

46
00:02:29,260 --> 00:02:32,849
123 half a dozen a dozen other

47
00:02:32,849 --> 00:02:36,620
parties in companies are going to end up
knowing what it was that you are reading

48
00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:41,769
we can indeed so girl every except

49
00:02:41,769 --> 00:02:45,260
by doing sorry your you are adopting
your your

50
00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:49,080
accepting a significant amount
inconvenience compared to what we now

51
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:53,760
have is our best way everything so yes
you can the time being until they close

52
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:55,019
let's try and keep them open

53
00:02:55,019 --> 00:02:58,420
a wit you still have those physical
libraries but

54
00:02:58,420 --> 00:03:02,640
you know we just lived through her
something that was actually

55
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:05,989
the equivalent love the gutenberg
invention of the printing press in terms

56
00:03:05,989 --> 00:03:06,330
of that

57
00:03:06,330 --> 00:03:10,040
degree a transformation I'm and a.m.

58
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:13,430
awesome improvement writing in terms of
the way it works

59
00:03:13,430 --> 00:03:17,140
but we didn't bring privacy with us
anyway throughout this

60
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:20,390
slide deck I'm gonna have some pictures
a badge is because I can't help it

61
00:03:20,390 --> 00:03:24,510
out and you know we have the sad badger
because we've lost the right to privacy

62
00:03:24,510 --> 00:03:27,580
'em and we built this new medium

63
00:03:27,580 --> 00:03:31,200
the world wide web it's an amazing
achievement but

64
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:35,610
along the way we fail to build it with
privacy in the design

65
00:03:35,610 --> 00:03:40,090
answer the web you know your has these
creepy eyes the spying on us

66
00:03:40,090 --> 00:03:44,140
a.m. man anytime you get your side just
think about cue badges

67
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:47,400
will say cheerful and will make it
better home

68
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:50,950
but if you look inside the design have
them on web

69
00:03:50,950 --> 00:03:54,819
a this this privacy problem with moving
in

70
00:03:54,819 --> 00:03:59,590
really deeply home you wanna have basic
hypertext functionality you want

71
00:03:59,590 --> 00:04:01,040
hyperlinks to embedding

72
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:04,120
well you just also built

73
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:08,390
refer post and them and get tracking the
pages

74
00:04:08,390 --> 00:04:11,560
your you're looking at just disclosed to
other

75
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:15,159
web servers the fact that you were a
looking at the

76
00:04:15,159 --> 00:04:19,889
the source page when you embedded image
because we are just use the web for

77
00:04:19,889 --> 00:04:20,660
hypertext

78
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:25,169
we fees are interfaces so you wanna
stateful user interface that remembers

79
00:04:25,169 --> 00:04:27,610
what buttons you clicked in actions he
took a moment ago

80
00:04:27,610 --> 00:04:32,100
well unique cookies or some other state
tracking mechanism

81
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:35,110
and those turn out also be the the

82
00:04:35,110 --> 00:04:39,889
index them identifies the used in these
giant databases

83
00:04:39,889 --> 00:04:43,040
by reading habits my activities sir

84
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:47,040
awesome functionality we wanted is
completely entangled with the design

85
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:51,000
uva surveillance system do you want
offline

86
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:55,889
webapps and modern browser that supports
a nifty features for this local

87
00:04:55,889 --> 00:04:57,250
databases that

88
00:04:57,250 --> 00:05:00,280
they'll store for application with with
it

89
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:04,060
records and and state now you have super
cookies or even though you thought you

90
00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:05,250
block your cookies

91
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:08,289
there's this other thing that can be
used to store identifies and send them

92
00:05:08,289 --> 00:05:09,509
back to sites

93
00:05:09,509 --> 00:05:12,900
so they know who you are and okay sir

94
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:16,789
you know we have these problems and and
what does it mean in practice

95
00:05:16,789 --> 00:05:20,080
um means there are a lot of people

96
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:23,410
growing up knowing what you read some
love them a

97
00:05:23,410 --> 00:05:28,400
no because in a more fundamental sense
they have a platform on which you're

98
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:31,289
reading there the first parties in your
address bar

99
00:05:31,289 --> 00:05:34,930
whether that's at your Google or
Facebook Amazon used people do so much

100
00:05:34,930 --> 00:05:36,199
through those companies

101
00:05:36,199 --> 00:05:39,620
that they just get to see a giant when
you and your life

102
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:43,610
um its people have have surreptitiously
snuck onto your computer

103
00:05:43,610 --> 00:05:47,060
um you've installed some ap custom
browser

104
00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:50,630
toolbar or something I'm here a bunch of
these examples

105
00:05:50,630 --> 00:05:54,490
they really deceptive sometimes you end
up with this thing on your computer

106
00:05:54,490 --> 00:05:56,199
probably not people in this room but

107
00:05:56,199 --> 00:05:59,810
your relatives when you go to help them
with that buddy computers you'll find

108
00:05:59,810 --> 00:06:00,639
them for love this

109
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:04,990
about this stuff a.m. and its tracking
them

110
00:06:04,990 --> 00:06:08,060
and then a these guys

111
00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:10,800
the third parties on the web for the
ones who really take advantage but

112
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:11,340
properties

113
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:14,610
hypertext I was talking about before
where they've

114
00:06:14,610 --> 00:06:18,470
woven themselves into the page and just
by learning it and I love it

115
00:06:18,470 --> 00:06:23,560
it some resources you end up telling
them what you're doing all the time

116
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:27,039
sir a.m.

117
00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:30,460
this is the situation I'm gonna focus in
this talk on these

118
00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:34,479
these kinda track

119
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:38,970
so I i won everyone in our along the way
let's just try and keep a vision above

120
00:06:38,970 --> 00:06:40,160
what what what we want here

121
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:44,020
we want the beautiful infinite library
if the web

122
00:06:44,020 --> 00:06:47,520
infinite library hypertext is really
enjoy looking at pictures a beautiful

123
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:50,610
libros actually I'm sorry is another one
I am

124
00:06:50,610 --> 00:06:54,000
at cost the one we have on the web or
the one we aspire to having also has a

125
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,240
lot of you pictures of

126
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:59,270
animals on it um a they they they occupy

127
00:06:59,270 --> 00:07:02,479
you know prominent adult and place their

128
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:05,990
but how is this beautiful thing funded
how is it

129
00:07:05,990 --> 00:07:09,819
it built it's built around also the
ghastly things we don't want to know

130
00:07:09,819 --> 00:07:10,910
about like a

131
00:07:10,910 --> 00:07:14,259
you know deceptive ads for anti-virus
software that they're actually malware

132
00:07:14,259 --> 00:07:15,380
themselves

133
00:07:15,380 --> 00:07:19,819
a.m. you know going to such a Firefox
and what you find at the top is an ad

134
00:07:19,819 --> 00:07:23,460
for the younger version of Firefox that
probably comes bundled with some kind of

135
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:24,690
tool bother

136
00:07:24,690 --> 00:07:29,479
you'd rather not know the details of a
all these weird weather adds that

137
00:07:29,479 --> 00:07:33,660
I'm maybe some of us don't see if you're
an ad blocker

138
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:37,069
but a lot of humanity that vast majority
of humanity is saying this stuff

139
00:07:37,069 --> 00:07:38,300
clicking on it

140
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:42,430
and this is the underbelly thats paying
for

141
00:07:42,430 --> 00:07:45,500
a a large fraction of the current web

142
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:49,680
and probably in a beautiful infinite
library we look rather was funded by

143
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:50,860
something

144
00:07:50,860 --> 00:07:57,020
more principled sir how did we get into
this mess

145
00:07:57,020 --> 00:08:00,539
I don't think anyone exactly knows the
answer you know

146
00:08:00,539 --> 00:08:03,879
collectively when I species stumbles
into a mass it's usually the practice

147
00:08:03,879 --> 00:08:04,910
many forces

148
00:08:04,910 --> 00:08:09,620
but a couple interesting a processes
that I wanna call

149
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:12,910
one is these bad guys you're probably
all familiar with

150
00:08:12,910 --> 00:08:16,349
a.m. the RIAA and MPAA and they're like

151
00:08:16,349 --> 00:08:20,650
crazy a jihad against the Internet in
the name of copyright law

152
00:08:20,650 --> 00:08:24,759
has actually a being I think hugely
destructive

153
00:08:24,759 --> 00:08:28,020
for the way the web got built in the

154
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:32,909
the RIP the subtle thing here's these
these guys would like bad guys to us

155
00:08:32,909 --> 00:08:36,659
but if you're a policymaker if you're
member

156
00:08:36,659 --> 00:08:40,469
a the establishment they are respected
industry

157
00:08:40,469 --> 00:08:44,360
that's been around for a long time and
has a legitimate claim

158
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:48,660
to representing semi legitimate claim at
least representing creative people

159
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:50,670
authors artists musicians

160
00:08:50,670 --> 00:08:54,950
who need to get paid for their work and
these industries

161
00:08:54,950 --> 00:08:58,260
have managed to KFC's all mind share

162
00:08:58,260 --> 00:09:02,580
around the idea that we have social
institutions

163
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:05,970
that a vet pay office and those that
institution

164
00:09:05,970 --> 00:09:09,930
all those institutions all you know
Copyright Act handmaidens

165
00:09:09,930 --> 00:09:14,149
DRM collecting societies all this
infrastructure

166
00:09:14,149 --> 00:09:17,459
that Weiner everyone here knows is
hopelessly broken

167
00:09:17,459 --> 00:09:21,230
you know we can't pay artists and
authors in the future using DA ramen

168
00:09:21,230 --> 00:09:22,040
copyright

169
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:25,519
and the idea that you could is absurd
and yet

170
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:29,040
this buncha industries hijacked

171
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:32,450
any conversation about what we might
dear

172
00:09:32,450 --> 00:09:36,209
instead if we would have set out to
design good institutions

173
00:09:36,209 --> 00:09:39,649
for paying office services one problem

174
00:09:39,649 --> 00:09:43,550
that we face politically the other
problem

175
00:09:43,550 --> 00:09:47,209
is that people outside I think
ultimately technologically and

176
00:09:47,209 --> 00:09:48,000
politically

177
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,839
um looked around at their options your
smart people in Silicon Valley instead

178
00:09:52,839 --> 00:09:55,890
while there is one way we could make the
web that we want to

179
00:09:55,890 --> 00:09:59,269
work the free web let's like

180
00:09:59,269 --> 00:10:02,779
let's just make everything work
beautifully inelegantly and make it free

181
00:10:02,779 --> 00:10:06,260
and then they'll just be a small price
small percentage price

182
00:10:06,260 --> 00:10:09,930
in your privacy a.m. hand so that we can
show you

183
00:10:09,930 --> 00:10:13,149
ads that'll be very well targeted a.m.

184
00:10:13,149 --> 00:10:16,890
and we can build a beautiful version of
and I think that

185
00:10:16,890 --> 00:10:20,959
worked fall Google itself for faith in
our Twitter itself

186
00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:25,890
for some others companies but what
hasn't worked for very well

187
00:10:25,890 --> 00:10:29,649
is the web as a whole and in particular
its meant that the web as a whole is

188
00:10:29,649 --> 00:10:31,130
this tracking mechanism

189
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:34,850
and where in this situation where we
don't wanna live with that privacy

190
00:10:34,850 --> 00:10:36,240
invasive web

191
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:39,339
we do want to find it we do want good
institutions

192
00:10:39,339 --> 00:10:42,839
I'm but we don't want the exact version
with

193
00:10:42,839 --> 00:10:46,600
where we're living with sir how do we
get out of this mess

194
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:50,940
am I think there are many ways that
packages should be thinking about

195
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:55,680
'em to fix this and you know some people
already proposing creative

196
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:59,029
bizarre models like I think the rise of
Kickstarter is

197
00:10:59,029 --> 00:11:03,540
a great thing for the web I think the
rise of a flat I and other payment

198
00:11:03,540 --> 00:11:04,930
methods you can use to

199
00:11:04,930 --> 00:11:08,029
to send a little payment to the the the
site you're on

200
00:11:08,029 --> 00:11:11,399
is a great development I think people
are talking about ideas like

201
00:11:11,399 --> 00:11:15,399
variants have picked Ryan that pay the
sites you enjoy reading

202
00:11:15,399 --> 00:11:19,930
just automatically when you visit them a
all these directions for innovation

203
00:11:19,930 --> 00:11:23,690
should be pursued but the while I'm
gonna talk about today

204
00:11:23,690 --> 00:11:27,350
is the simplest and they say look we're
not gonna get rid of the advertising

205
00:11:27,350 --> 00:11:28,360
funded web

206
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:33,690
a.m. its its be again it's producing
good things as well as privacy invasion

207
00:11:33,690 --> 00:11:37,660
let's just make it suck less let's
figure out a way

208
00:11:37,660 --> 00:11:41,670
to have online advertising that isn't
quite is demonic

209
00:11:41,670 --> 00:11:45,570
is what we've had so far the strategy is

210
00:11:45,570 --> 00:11:48,630
bill privacy tools that everyone not
just people in this room

211
00:11:48,630 --> 00:11:53,120
who know how to use no script or
whatever um everyone can use them 24/7

212
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:57,610
it has been stalled once and work nicely
they reintroduce the concept have

213
00:11:57,610 --> 00:11:58,950
consent

214
00:11:58,950 --> 00:12:02,779
server instead of just browsing around
the web and 12 companies get your

215
00:12:02,779 --> 00:12:05,430
reading habits are 100 companies that
you're reading habits

216
00:12:05,430 --> 00:12:08,649
if the price using Facebook

217
00:12:08,649 --> 00:12:12,970
or some other side is that your you have
no privacy on that side

218
00:12:12,970 --> 00:12:16,420
that's a clear negotiation with the user

219
00:12:16,420 --> 00:12:19,920
and they can make a choice about whether
that's a price they willing to pay

220
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:23,579
am this is to love the rhetoric of the
advertising industry today but it's

221
00:12:23,579 --> 00:12:27,240
you know fiction no one actually
consents to third party tracking

222
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:31,279
let's ranges real content informed
consent

223
00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:34,889
um let's find the best practices that
you know some of the less evil

224
00:12:34,889 --> 00:12:36,779
advertising companies have out there

225
00:12:36,779 --> 00:12:40,070
and make those the minimum flaw for the
web

226
00:12:40,070 --> 00:12:44,430
an encourager marketplace where
advertising companies actually compete

227
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:45,760
to do better than

228
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:48,850
and their incentives which currently
don't exist you wouldn't know the

229
00:12:48,850 --> 00:12:51,000
difference between an should you buy a

230
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,000
creepy tracking company Anna one that
respects

231
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,870
your privacy let let's make that
actually happened

232
00:12:57,870 --> 00:13:01,089
%uh so we're gonna do this with this
brother extension

233
00:13:01,089 --> 00:13:05,829
call privacy badger um its gonna go out
there and find those

234
00:13:05,829 --> 00:13:09,639
a hypertext cookies and do something
about them its gonna find the Super

235
00:13:09,639 --> 00:13:10,260
cookies

236
00:13:10,260 --> 00:13:13,279
and tracked them down to get rid of them
I am

237
00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:18,329
and implement this this strategic vision

238
00:13:18,329 --> 00:13:23,010
sir along the way in our why is my
writing privacy is of a high why doesn't

239
00:13:23,010 --> 00:13:23,260
this

240
00:13:23,190 --> 00:13:26,860
already exists um at a large part of the
answer is

241
00:13:26,860 --> 00:13:30,560
arms races you know we've been telling
people a technologist

242
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:33,860
I'll do something about cookies or do
something about this tracking mechanism

243
00:13:33,860 --> 00:13:37,139
about for decades actually a.m.

244
00:13:37,139 --> 00:13:40,740
and people out there actually hear this
slowly they hear

245
00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:43,930
I'll yeah I should clear my cookies and
I start doing that

246
00:13:43,930 --> 00:13:48,310
a but when you gonna arms race between
individuals trying to reconfigure their

247
00:13:48,310 --> 00:13:49,660
brothers manually

248
00:13:49,660 --> 00:13:52,810
or using you know once you have the
traditional extensions

249
00:13:52,810 --> 00:13:57,470
and the bad guys who are doing a
whatever it takes we lodge engineering

250
00:13:57,470 --> 00:13:58,750
teams to track you

251
00:13:58,750 --> 00:14:03,199
the bad guys again when a we actually
met in a measurement of one of the

252
00:14:03,199 --> 00:14:06,519
mechanisms the bad guys were using in
this panoptic project which you might

253
00:14:06,519 --> 00:14:07,600
have come across

254
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:11,470
this was a little hillside is still
alive measures the fingerprint ability

255
00:14:11,470 --> 00:14:14,389
of your browser the date on the size a
little bit all

256
00:14:14,389 --> 00:14:18,940
but come what we found in our initial
tests are about a million browsers in

257
00:14:18,940 --> 00:14:19,949
the course if

258
00:14:19,949 --> 00:14:24,550
a couple of weeks was that around ninety
percent of the desktop browser in that

259
00:14:24,550 --> 00:14:25,260
sample

260
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:28,260
could be uniquely identified have a
sample a million

261
00:14:28,260 --> 00:14:31,690
just from the configuration and settings
information you could read

262
00:14:31,690 --> 00:14:35,170
from a webpage say that you make a few
JavaScript call saying you know what's

263
00:14:35,170 --> 00:14:36,560
the screen resolution

264
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:40,230
what plugins is proud to have what funds
render

265
00:14:40,230 --> 00:14:43,709
and you get back a unique identifiers
and so the bad guys

266
00:14:43,709 --> 00:14:47,600
Roy have all of these tricks sneaky
things they can do to your browser to

267
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:49,190
track you

268
00:14:49,190 --> 00:14:52,690
can win this kind of arms race and your

269
00:14:52,690 --> 00:14:56,050
our attitude to this is look if we have
to fight an arms race

270
00:14:56,050 --> 00:15:00,940
privacy Badgers ready for that but we'd
prefer not to live in peace

271
00:15:00,940 --> 00:15:05,360
actually figure out a you know waitin
not be fighting arms races to

272
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:08,839
to get a policy escape valve from that

273
00:15:08,839 --> 00:15:12,639
um sir reviewed do not track as

274
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:16,250
draft a policy part of a solution here
do not track

275
00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:21,230
is ahead a that your browser can send to
air a website or a third party website

276
00:15:21,230 --> 00:15:25,690
saying dnt wanna do not track this
brother you know without permission

277
00:15:25,690 --> 00:15:29,259
and the theory was week on um

278
00:15:29,259 --> 00:15:32,459
solve all these complicated
fingerprinting separately problems as a

279
00:15:32,459 --> 00:15:34,329
surly but we can send a clear

280
00:15:34,329 --> 00:15:37,829
message the company saying this you did
not consent to being tracked

281
00:15:37,829 --> 00:15:42,940
and then it's a policy obligation on the
part of that company to respected

282
00:15:42,940 --> 00:15:46,889
now what we saw and there's a long-range
a backstory to this is

283
00:15:46,889 --> 00:15:50,110
for a brief moment the US advertising in
tracking industry

284
00:15:50,110 --> 00:15:53,110
thought about doing this and then settle
on the answer

285
00:15:53,110 --> 00:15:57,240
that was do not track means pretend not
to track

286
00:15:57,240 --> 00:16:01,110
what we will do when we see a do not
track had a is we will keep tracking

287
00:16:01,110 --> 00:16:05,639
year but will stop showing you the
creepy ads based on what we know

288
00:16:05,639 --> 00:16:08,870
and the you know that theory I think was

289
00:16:08,870 --> 00:16:12,680
what people can tell how when they're
they have creepy ads

290
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:16,620
and that creates a political problem for
us so we'll try to get rid of the

291
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:17,920
political problem

292
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:21,399
by by using dante tried to identify the

293
00:16:21,399 --> 00:16:24,639
the people who are unhappy about the
state of the world but then we'll still

294
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:26,269
track

295
00:16:26,269 --> 00:16:29,360
so what do we do about that a.m.

296
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:33,410
that's when we went back to the drawing
board and Taylor K let's build privacy

297
00:16:33,410 --> 00:16:34,060
badger

298
00:16:34,060 --> 00:16:37,570
let's take the pre-existing best
offenses that you could

299
00:16:37,570 --> 00:16:41,000
use in your browser now I which were
exactly right over time

300
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:44,399
they've gotten a little bit better
actually but in I'm gonna particular

301
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:46,009
caught ghost story is being

302
00:16:46,009 --> 00:16:49,290
you know not really a serious credible
privacy tool

303
00:16:49,290 --> 00:16:53,220
Adblock Plus can be if you configure it
correctly disconnect is

304
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:56,709
is the best service 3 a.m. we want to do
your

305
00:16:56,709 --> 00:17:01,310
let you know the perfected version of
this this vision

306
00:17:01,310 --> 00:17:04,770
we want the serious badge if it's there
to protect year um

307
00:17:04,770 --> 00:17:08,010
is also ready for pace if if needed am

308
00:17:08,010 --> 00:17:12,669
your browser extension for Firefox no

309
00:17:12,669 --> 00:17:16,919
browser extension for Chrome and Eric
crimes not nearly as cute but I think it

310
00:17:16,919 --> 00:17:20,919
a flying bad you're on a weird angle is
probably the best we can do for that

311
00:17:20,919 --> 00:17:25,780
you look at the Firefox try again

312
00:17:25,780 --> 00:17:28,820
a.m. strategies as as I mentioned before

313
00:17:28,820 --> 00:17:32,480
reintroduce consent the tactics are

314
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:36,070
block all of the non-consensual trackers
and

315
00:17:36,070 --> 00:17:40,110
but if its main promises to on hedging
on track

316
00:17:40,110 --> 00:17:43,350
van unblock that to me how do we measure
that

317
00:17:43,350 --> 00:17:46,850
walking on a standard for this we have a
draft our site you can look at actual

318
00:17:46,850 --> 00:17:51,250
should've put the URL in here it's BFF
dog slashed dnt hyphen policy

319
00:17:51,250 --> 00:17:55,880
um it's a verbatim text file bit like a
robust a txt file but

320
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:59,250
you post a verbatim promise that the
strong progress

321
00:17:59,250 --> 00:18:02,830
from saying when we see a do not track
and we all

322
00:18:02,830 --> 00:18:06,240
honor it in that this specific way that
set out here

323
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:09,539
and then that becomes legally
enforceable in the United States

324
00:18:09,539 --> 00:18:12,910
feud your website does that makes that
promise at the end

325
00:18:12,910 --> 00:18:16,280
violated the FTC the federal trade
commission can go in

326
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:21,059
in force against that or the in Europe
the European Commission can create

327
00:18:21,059 --> 00:18:25,400
legal consequences for people promising
to on a do not track

328
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:29,400
and and then lying about it so we have
this way of checking for sites

329
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:34,190
that promised to do it right and then
we're creating incentives for them to do

330
00:18:34,190 --> 00:18:35,230
that

331
00:18:35,230 --> 00:18:38,660
to private imagine we'll never block the
add the widget of third-placed of

332
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:42,520
a site that makes this promise there
were three design options

333
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:46,460
reconsidered for how to do the blocking
part um one would be

334
00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:49,950
you know I'm manual curation online
scrapbook plus

335
00:18:49,950 --> 00:18:53,390
then there's a an automated centralized
version and then an automated

336
00:18:53,390 --> 00:18:55,350
decentralized in the browser version so
the

337
00:18:55,350 --> 00:18:59,090
the first division is you work with an
open source community and you make an

338
00:18:59,090 --> 00:19:00,289
exhaustive list

339
00:19:00,289 --> 00:19:05,070
every track you can find um each and
this sort of works for Adblock Plus

340
00:19:05,070 --> 00:19:09,230
but involves shipping canonical list a

341
00:19:09,230 --> 00:19:12,530
everything is considered good and bad on
the web and

342
00:19:12,530 --> 00:19:15,570
ff3 we didn't really want to do this if
we can avoid it

343
00:19:15,570 --> 00:19:19,130
we didn't want to be in a position to
arbitrating for the whole web

344
00:19:19,130 --> 00:19:24,870
by hand a.m. the second option would be
to run a giant kroll or Senate crawlers

345
00:19:24,870 --> 00:19:28,620
across the hallway min try and figure
out what things were violating your do

346
00:19:28,620 --> 00:19:29,960
not track request them

347
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:34,720
and identify those and then ship
automatically generated block list

348
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:38,710
the third version um would rely
exclusively on

349
00:19:38,710 --> 00:19:42,049
almost exclusively on algorithms in the
browser sorry

350
00:19:42,049 --> 00:19:45,559
the browser itself watches what's
happening over time privacy Badgers

351
00:19:45,559 --> 00:19:46,350
there

352
00:19:46,350 --> 00:19:49,860
observing third parties in your in your
web pages

353
00:19:49,860 --> 00:19:53,970
um and it automatically blocks them when
they appear to be tracking

354
00:19:53,970 --> 00:19:57,710
now interestingly it's Hannah Internet
Explorer 8

355
00:19:57,710 --> 00:20:01,370
and I've any of you ever use Internet
Explorer 8 I'm

356
00:20:01,370 --> 00:20:05,360
i no i didnt but a a is had a feature
called

357
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:09,640
InPrivate Filtering that would do this
and they actually

358
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:12,909
pulled it but because I'm lobbying by
the advertising industry

359
00:20:12,909 --> 00:20:17,049
and because I love the fact that when it
ended on eventually would stop

360
00:20:17,049 --> 00:20:21,630
breaking things that we're both trackers
and necessary for the functionality of

361
00:20:21,630 --> 00:20:23,289
page is a good example if this

362
00:20:23,289 --> 00:20:28,679
is pages that embed Google Maps the the
demesne that serves the map tiles

363
00:20:28,679 --> 00:20:32,030
accept cookies and tracks you

364
00:20:32,030 --> 00:20:36,250
and so if they would get blocked um but
you probably didn't want those maps

365
00:20:36,250 --> 00:20:37,890
disappearing out on those pages

366
00:20:37,890 --> 00:20:41,750
so in your from that lesson that history
lesson that it wouldn't be good enough

367
00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:42,940
to just do that

368
00:20:42,940 --> 00:20:46,870
now we say what we'll do is we'll um
include an additional

369
00:20:46,870 --> 00:20:51,260
grey list that goes over the top of the
algorithm in says me know about a domain

370
00:20:51,260 --> 00:20:51,559
that

371
00:20:51,559 --> 00:20:56,130
is like this will be instead a blocking
it all together will block its cookies

372
00:20:56,130 --> 00:21:00,280
and the aim was for this third option to
build something that might wait one day

373
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:01,390
be Sugar Bowl

374
00:21:01,390 --> 00:21:04,490
for the browser it for the browser
vendors themselves

375
00:21:04,490 --> 00:21:07,919
might be a standard that could be
deployed across the web

376
00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:11,120
I'm we had to do some calculations on
whether we thought it was

377
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:15,220
feasible to do near a track a blocking
this way

378
00:21:15,220 --> 00:21:19,100
this is a data set from a paper by

379
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:22,640
pound man might draw them actually speak
spoke earlier today

380
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:26,140
a.m. this red crash

381
00:21:26,140 --> 00:21:30,900
and churros vid the room relationship
between false positives and success

382
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:34,000
blocking trackers um if you do this

383
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,880
have observation of tracking just from
inside a single browser

384
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:41,010
you know how many a first party sites to
see

385
00:21:41,010 --> 00:21:44,220
this third-party tracker on so on this
act as you have the the false-positive

386
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:44,970
rate

387
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:48,570
higher is worse on this access you have
the

388
00:21:48,570 --> 00:21:52,460
fraction of tracking that stopped a
higher is better

389
00:21:52,460 --> 00:21:55,539
and then the blue line is more global
view

390
00:21:55,539 --> 00:21:59,390
to global classify like a I talked about
a crawl you run across the whole web

391
00:21:59,390 --> 00:22:04,049
um but week we we want to be close to
100 here

392
00:22:04,049 --> 00:22:07,789
so we wanna um we wanna be somewhere

393
00:22:07,789 --> 00:22:11,400
up in this region whichever method we
use and then we're gonna have to drag

394
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:12,990
ourselves back over to the

395
00:22:12,990 --> 00:22:16,450
0 close to their false positive rate and
that's what the cookie blocking gray

396
00:22:16,450 --> 00:22:17,169
with dust.

397
00:22:17,169 --> 00:22:21,770
I am answer then the question was how
many domains would we need to manually

398
00:22:21,770 --> 00:22:22,539
grey list

399
00:22:22,539 --> 00:22:25,950
in order to get cloisters your false
positive in practice

400
00:22:25,950 --> 00:22:29,480
yasser seem to be like a few hundred so
we just set out on me

401
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:33,120
from this data set we went identified
those few hundred domains gray listed

402
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:33,580
them

403
00:22:33,580 --> 00:22:36,419
and then said okay we've got to get a
bug tracker people find other things

404
00:22:36,419 --> 00:22:38,049
that need to be relisted let's just

405
00:22:38,049 --> 00:22:41,130
deal with them as they come um

406
00:22:41,130 --> 00:22:44,179
so we're going with this decentralized
thing that what might one day be part of

407
00:22:44,179 --> 00:22:45,640
a brother

408
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:49,659
we have this gray listing mechanism
option to out this list at the beginning

409
00:22:49,659 --> 00:22:50,900
I show you

410
00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:55,669
and we built it

411
00:22:55,669 --> 00:22:59,390
and you can get it at this URL now I'm
gonna try and

412
00:22:59,390 --> 00:23:03,500
this may not work I'm gonna try it you
actually jump over and give you guys a

413
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:04,400
live demo are

414
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:07,580
we'll see how I go there with them

415
00:23:07,580 --> 00:23:14,580
my luck and multiple displays and
getting a browser to run here

416
00:23:18,290 --> 00:23:20,490
so we own it let's try this with the

417
00:23:20,490 --> 00:23:24,290
gambling directory illustrates a group
from

418
00:23:24,290 --> 00:23:31,290
you guys actually cut see this

419
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:37,559
hi

420
00:23:37,559 --> 00:23:41,639
very good this promising

421
00:23:41,639 --> 00:23:48,639
us

422
00:23:50,090 --> 00:23:54,830
so what we gonna do is we're gonna run a
fresh copy if people prime here

423
00:23:54,830 --> 00:23:59,420
show up on the wrong

424
00:23:59,420 --> 00:24:06,420
screens right place

425
00:24:15,570 --> 00:24:18,870
costs your browser the very first thing
I want to do is get your identity and

426
00:24:18,870 --> 00:24:19,800
start tracking

427
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:24,480
when I can lead to that a what we gonna
do is we're gonna go straight to the

428
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:25,140
Euro

429
00:24:25,140 --> 00:24:32,140
telling you about and I get privacy
better

430
00:24:37,779 --> 00:24:41,289
i sorry least once a super small so I'll
try and make that big a survey

431
00:24:41,289 --> 00:24:48,289
see okay so we can install this

432
00:24:50,850 --> 00:24:54,060
so now we have this little button in the
corner the browser what's this doing

433
00:24:54,060 --> 00:24:57,510
I'm on this page is not doing anything
with no track as him

434
00:24:57,510 --> 00:25:01,810
but let's go and look at the no-one in a
male

435
00:25:01,810 --> 00:25:05,090
a random website you chew

436
00:25:05,090 --> 00:25:09,360
alright let's go to YouTube you choose
an interesting one because it it has

437
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:12,460
some third party tonight but they're
also love basically run by the same

438
00:25:12,460 --> 00:25:13,170
company

439
00:25:13,170 --> 00:25:17,660
I'm and what you see right at them at
the moment is all a visa listed as dream

440
00:25:17,660 --> 00:25:21,260
because privacy badger has never data
and/or multiple sites that is observed a

441
00:25:21,260 --> 00:25:23,560
tracking across a let's go to another
side

442
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:27,050
terrorist CNN dot com and they've been a

443
00:25:27,050 --> 00:25:31,270
you know your is at the television
station has been playing at Arsenal

444
00:25:31,270 --> 00:25:37,290
the elevator they're talking about
players like a

445
00:25:37,290 --> 00:25:42,920
article here muster another tab Slashdot

446
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:46,320
is what we want is a to see

447
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:50,840
after a little while when privacy by
just not seeing you on multiple

448
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:54,110
the since talking back

449
00:25:54,110 --> 00:25:57,860
am where such thing on multiple pages

450
00:25:57,860 --> 00:26:01,250
is going to start saying wait a minute
not everything screen anymore actually

451
00:26:01,250 --> 00:26:02,890
even within a few pages

452
00:26:02,890 --> 00:26:06,620
you've seen multiple a instances have
double click

453
00:26:06,620 --> 00:26:11,480
China cookie you inside those pages so
double-click as an example a domain

454
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:14,840
that's been completely blocked its not
loading the content from that to mean

455
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:18,080
does a single dot com on several days
Google

456
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:22,040
as a third party hears is not being
blocked because it's often used for API

457
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:22,880
functionality

458
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:26,310
instead it in this yellow stayed where
it having its cookies

459
00:26:26,310 --> 00:26:30,670
what come to privacy matters all
automatically able to figure out what's

460
00:26:30,670 --> 00:26:31,520
going to another

461
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:36,170
new site lets go washington Post Oak com

462
00:26:36,170 --> 00:26:41,600
here on this line

463
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:46,030
wow there's a lot of stuff going on here

464
00:26:46,030 --> 00:26:49,740
this is all still being a this is also
being waitlisted

465
00:26:49,740 --> 00:26:53,520
occurs it it hasn't been observed very
much less over like five more tabs

466
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:57,310
and like so your pawn dot com

467
00:26:57,310 --> 00:27:03,380
yeah guys gonna call them out BuzzFeed

468
00:27:03,380 --> 00:27:10,380
yep

469
00:27:18,409 --> 00:27:19,840
the

470
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:26,840
the

471
00:27:28,650 --> 00:27:29,970
so what's going on over here

472
00:27:29,970 --> 00:27:34,480
neier tracking info channel it's
incredibly disappointing

473
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:41,480
I'm

474
00:27:44,180 --> 00:27:48,880
anyway sir I'm gonna go back to his
washington Post page resume earlier and

475
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:51,510
let's see whether anything has changed
when we alerted

476
00:27:51,510 --> 00:27:55,210
giant pilot demands that we saw before

477
00:27:55,210 --> 00:27:58,910
um actually love this still Graeme

478
00:27:58,910 --> 00:28:04,090
a few things getting blocked hours to a
few more pages then

479
00:28:04,090 --> 00:28:08,320
Amazon hovering not very Traci a these
black

480
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:12,400
like future the big online companies
tend not to have these giant house a

481
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:13,360
third parties because they

482
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:16,970
run them themselves whereas the its new
sites

483
00:28:16,970 --> 00:28:23,970
and

484
00:28:27,340 --> 00:28:27,970
well as sub

485
00:28:27,970 --> 00:28:34,970
BuzzFeed thing also what you tend to
find when you click through an article

486
00:28:35,620 --> 00:28:37,850
you get a lot more tracking

487
00:28:37,850 --> 00:28:44,850
Gawker dot com

488
00:28:46,260 --> 00:28:51,900
the time here

489
00:28:51,900 --> 00:28:58,900
go back to the washington post and
article

490
00:29:01,159 --> 00:29:04,690
but you also know this is the ads are
starting to disappear now for privacy

491
00:29:04,690 --> 00:29:07,240
matter doesn't explicitly target ads at
all

492
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:11,440
um he actually just treats them the same
as everything else

493
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:14,629
it just happens I A so exciting to see
even

494
00:29:14,629 --> 00:29:17,759
you know this track is that green before
actually being marked this

495
00:29:17,759 --> 00:29:21,710
as things that I not respecting a gr8
track request and

496
00:29:21,710 --> 00:29:25,610
as I said is not targeting ads
specifically it just happens that

497
00:29:25,610 --> 00:29:29,710
ads don't respect you know attract a
cookie you when you see an ad on the web

498
00:29:29,710 --> 00:29:33,429
it's actually seeing year and seeing the
pager on and writing that down a

499
00:29:33,429 --> 00:29:35,210
database are intended to bases

500
00:29:35,210 --> 00:29:38,210
sir let's go back

501
00:29:38,210 --> 00:29:41,909
to hear the SlideShare ands

502
00:29:41,909 --> 00:29:46,350
other one more thing I wanna show you
actually 4G that

503
00:29:46,350 --> 00:29:50,659
some courts are all this you would have
seen here and the B division of privacy

504
00:29:50,659 --> 00:29:51,159
better

505
00:29:51,159 --> 00:29:58,159
and their couple of cool things with
added in the in the

506
00:29:58,549 --> 00:30:02,850
a.m. sorry all this was in the offer
we've got this beetle is launching

507
00:30:02,850 --> 00:30:06,809
I'm you can actually get it on the site
right now even though it's not all

508
00:30:06,809 --> 00:30:10,429
labeled as such um sir

509
00:30:10,429 --> 00:30:17,429
this is in its

510
00:30:20,380 --> 00:30:25,040
if you're blocking and two main this
will

511
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:28,530
happen by the false I S um

512
00:30:28,530 --> 00:30:31,600
this is not fully implemented yet it
doesn't I

513
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:34,600
we're getting success with one of these
widgets here um

514
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:38,140
privacy measures is starting to
incorporate code to recognize these

515
00:30:38,140 --> 00:30:38,860
widgets

516
00:30:38,860 --> 00:30:42,100
that things we see everywhere and of
course widgets like

517
00:30:42,100 --> 00:30:45,400
ads see you when you see them they track
you um

518
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:48,510
when privacy budget would block a widget

519
00:30:48,510 --> 00:30:52,470
in the alpha version they just disappear
you just lose these widgets on the page

520
00:30:52,470 --> 00:30:56,910
always trying to do is drop in %uh
little privacy badger versions are the

521
00:30:56,910 --> 00:30:58,380
widget sir

522
00:30:58,380 --> 00:31:01,570
this is instead of making the Google+
which it disappear if you want to

523
00:31:01,570 --> 00:31:02,460
interact with it

524
00:31:02,460 --> 00:31:05,620
um it turns into this little button and
if you click that button

525
00:31:05,620 --> 00:31:09,440
attention to the real Google+ but no
with a tweaked version

526
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:12,650
ill just go to Twitter and open a
treatment for you sir

527
00:31:12,650 --> 00:31:16,340
up in cases where the functionality in
the tracking have been really working

528
00:31:16,340 --> 00:31:18,350
together and it's really widespread

529
00:31:18,350 --> 00:31:22,680
we're starting to play mechanism to let
you still have that functionality

530
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:26,210
and 10 of the tracking at the same time
um

531
00:31:26,210 --> 00:31:33,210
but going back to the slides here

532
00:31:38,350 --> 00:31:41,410
as what talk a little bit more

533
00:31:41,410 --> 00:31:44,690
philosophically about the state of the
web

534
00:31:44,690 --> 00:31:50,890
it's sort of an open question about
whether we're willing to live with

535
00:31:50,890 --> 00:31:53,050
advertising I think if I actually if

536
00:31:53,050 --> 00:31:57,660
your let us this room how many and maybe
it's unfair to do this after this talk

537
00:31:57,660 --> 00:32:01,290
how many have you guys think we'll
advertising sucks a bit but actually

538
00:32:01,290 --> 00:32:04,570
it's worth keeping %uh to

539
00:32:04,570 --> 00:32:08,480
respectable honorable way ultimately to
pay for stuff that we can give away for

540
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:08,900
free

541
00:32:08,900 --> 00:32:12,240
I say hands for that about

542
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:15,790
for Arthur how many you say like let's
just get rid of it

543
00:32:15,790 --> 00:32:20,990
actually about a quarter there are many
other I think they have a hot love you

544
00:32:20,990 --> 00:32:21,410
I'll

545
00:32:21,410 --> 00:32:25,270
like me somewhat conflicted on this
question or you're paying attention

546
00:32:25,270 --> 00:32:26,310
while the other

547
00:32:26,310 --> 00:32:30,460
a and so I don't think we have a good
answer

548
00:32:30,460 --> 00:32:33,610
to whether we want advertising on I
think we wanna let users block it

549
00:32:33,610 --> 00:32:34,410
completely if

550
00:32:34,410 --> 00:32:39,830
if they want to do that um but you know
as a society at we're gonna be living

551
00:32:39,830 --> 00:32:40,200
with

552
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:44,670
it's not going anywhere it's necessary
funding mechanism for a lot of stuff we

553
00:32:44,670 --> 00:32:45,200
value

554
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:48,270
answer in that situation

555
00:32:48,270 --> 00:32:51,940
I think it's non-negotiable that has two

556
00:32:51,940 --> 00:32:55,350
stop violating people's privacy

557
00:32:55,350 --> 00:33:02,350
without consent missus

558
00:33:05,370 --> 00:33:05,850
and

559
00:33:05,850 --> 00:33:10,519
that's something we think we can deliver
with this project and you guys can help

560
00:33:10,519 --> 00:33:13,610
actually by installing it yourselves I
am

561
00:33:13,610 --> 00:33:17,100
helping your friends and relatives to
install it

562
00:33:17,100 --> 00:33:21,240
and wit you know it code is on your
heart if there are things that break can

563
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:22,169
tell us about it

564
00:33:22,169 --> 00:33:26,279
help us build new features um and so I
think

565
00:33:26,279 --> 00:33:30,159
we're gonna get this piece done um one
way or another

566
00:33:30,159 --> 00:33:34,960
a the other question and this is a
question I want to hear people coming

567
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:35,750
back and give

568
00:33:35,750 --> 00:33:39,080
during talks about it hope next yes I I
built this thing

569
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:42,299
it's in your business model for the web
go and use it

570
00:33:42,299 --> 00:33:45,940
because you guys have the skills to make
this happen

571
00:33:45,940 --> 00:33:50,340
whether it's better for Jains a donation
whether it's you know she European

572
00:33:50,340 --> 00:33:54,169
actually the europeans have also the
traditions of using public funding

573
00:33:54,169 --> 00:33:57,840
to pay for the shipping artistry maybe
someone in Europe should go and figure

574
00:33:57,840 --> 00:34:00,510
out how to get the government to pay for
some web-sites

575
00:34:00,510 --> 00:34:03,679
a and you know our

576
00:34:03,679 --> 00:34:07,279
there's a lot more than we can explore
many is the script occurrences

577
00:34:07,279 --> 00:34:10,820
that by their nature pay artists as they
use down

578
00:34:10,820 --> 00:34:14,750
let's investigate this stuff let's make
the web banner and remember no

579
00:34:14,750 --> 00:34:21,750
to install privacy badger and I'll take
some questions

580
00:34:27,570 --> 00:34:31,400
when I am so as very sad

581
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:34,760
the and revenue that a lot of sites user

582
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:39,140
plenty of sites like our web comics &
blogs that would-be

583
00:34:39,140 --> 00:34:42,210
owners wouldn't be able to have those up
without the ad revenue

584
00:34:42,210 --> 00:34:46,950
I am does how does has privacy in the
Badger effect

585
00:34:46,950 --> 00:34:51,130
the ad revenue that they gain when you
visit their site if there's tracking in

586
00:34:51,130 --> 00:34:51,880
those ads

587
00:34:51,880 --> 00:34:56,760
so what we hope the answer's going to be
in a month watcher

588
00:34:56,760 --> 00:35:01,640
is not very much if at all what this is
going to take

589
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:05,400
is one advertiser that complies with the
Do Not Track policy

590
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:08,810
and then as soon as there's one
advertiser that does that

591
00:35:08,810 --> 00:35:12,310
waiting cars are all those web comics
hands

592
00:35:12,310 --> 00:35:17,330
up Online's small businesses say hey
you're using like advertising day

593
00:35:17,330 --> 00:35:22,150
yesterday and they were tracking your
users around the web in a complete the

594
00:35:22,150 --> 00:35:23,030
creepy fashion

595
00:35:23,030 --> 00:35:27,120
here is the alternative be um either

596
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:31,490
switch to them or just switch if you see
a user's sending in turn on track West

597
00:35:31,490 --> 00:35:32,740
you have to do it for everyone

598
00:35:32,740 --> 00:35:38,040
siege on track request up download the
JavaScript from the first advertising

599
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:39,670
network from the second one

600
00:35:39,670 --> 00:35:43,330
and so that's what I mean by we want to
create incentives for this industry and

601
00:35:43,330 --> 00:35:44,200
behave better

602
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:47,680
eyes were actually you were in the
process of saying down with some

603
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:50,460
advertising companies that we think a
more progressive on these issues

604
00:35:50,460 --> 00:35:54,640
and try to figure out with any of them
willing to be that pilot for doing it

605
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:55,160
that way

606
00:35:55,160 --> 00:36:01,610
can be pricey badger work as a fallback
for no script or how to respond to a be

607
00:36:01,610 --> 00:36:02,870
lockdown browser

608
00:36:02,870 --> 00:36:06,780
a browser with cookies disabled certain
sites et cetera yes sir

609
00:36:06,780 --> 00:36:10,470
%uh that's a great question um sir we
did

610
00:36:10,470 --> 00:36:13,900
the nor scripted actually plays pretty
nicely I think that a

611
00:36:13,900 --> 00:36:17,370
as a nurse curfews early some other time
myself I feel like the

612
00:36:17,370 --> 00:36:22,380
the I always wanna have an extension
that just looks at request my brothers

613
00:36:22,380 --> 00:36:23,450
making it says this

614
00:36:23,450 --> 00:36:28,310
subset requests don't on tracking
request I don't want my brother to be

615
00:36:28,310 --> 00:36:28,890
making

616
00:36:28,890 --> 00:36:33,530
for those away and then what's left I
want to be able to manually white script

617
00:36:33,530 --> 00:36:37,540
JavaScript fillers answer I think that
no script

618
00:36:37,540 --> 00:36:42,410
plus privacy matters pretty good pal
user experience and then terms a

619
00:36:42,410 --> 00:36:43,640
blocking cookies

620
00:36:43,640 --> 00:36:46,900
we had some issues with this in the
offer because the way we were detecting

621
00:36:46,900 --> 00:36:47,640
the tracking

622
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:52,620
was you know your instrument around API
calls

623
00:36:52,620 --> 00:36:56,590
that cookie blocking settings in your
browser would prevent from happening

624
00:36:56,590 --> 00:37:00,520
we've gotten a little better about that
by starting to look at

625
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:03,580
we cannot catch all the cases but when
you haven't incoming

626
00:37:03,580 --> 00:37:06,640
a HTTP response with a sec cookie had a

627
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:10,150
you can inspect back and even though
it's never gonna set the cookies you can

628
00:37:10,150 --> 00:37:11,810
say well it would have said this could
be

629
00:37:11,810 --> 00:37:15,700
that would have been tracking mechanisms
or this that I am is trying to do that

630
00:37:15,700 --> 00:37:16,740
I'll keep a regular

631
00:37:16,740 --> 00:37:21,930
pay a I just like to say this is my
first

632
00:37:21,930 --> 00:37:25,370
whole ever and is like the best welcome

633
00:37:25,370 --> 00:37:30,970
action %ah

634
00:37:30,970 --> 00:37:36,400
I've never seen a room feel was so many
intelligent people that desire for the

635
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:36,990
truth

636
00:37:36,990 --> 00:37:40,180
but thanks to Ron

637
00:37:40,180 --> 00:37:43,430
a honey this is my question

638
00:37:43,430 --> 00:37:46,640
you know I'm somewhat of a new

639
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:49,730
so to speak but you know that's kinda
besides the point

640
00:37:49,730 --> 00:37:53,410
but i wanna know is how did you

641
00:37:53,410 --> 00:37:58,300
establish and formulate in bills

642
00:37:58,300 --> 00:38:01,420
your brick road you yellow brick road to
your

643
00:38:01,420 --> 00:38:07,180
a know your feely Asian with what it
what it what it is that you do

644
00:38:07,180 --> 00:38:10,580
how did you build a brick road and Kane

645
00:38:10,580 --> 00:38:13,840
you give me 3

646
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:17,010
love functions this you through into

647
00:38:17,010 --> 00:38:21,470
the concoction love the mix of how are
you formulated 0

648
00:38:21,470 --> 00:38:25,830
what you doing now okay shot I i mean
there are two answers to that question

649
00:38:25,830 --> 00:38:28,170
when and how did I wind up being a
technologist

650
00:38:28,170 --> 00:38:31,180
BFF on the shots into that question was

651
00:38:31,180 --> 00:38:34,790
I think I was a.m. you know there are
two moments

652
00:38:34,790 --> 00:38:38,320
you know one was a I'll skip to the
second 1i was a

653
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:42,330
your computer science June working on my
my eyes this is which is like an

654
00:38:42,330 --> 00:38:44,550
American seen your face is it back in
Australia

655
00:38:44,550 --> 00:38:48,830
and I was you know as as probably ever
on trying to finish a thesis or

656
00:38:48,830 --> 00:38:53,010
dissertation any sort does I was
relearning web pages now trailing slash

657
00:38:53,010 --> 00:38:53,420
dot

658
00:38:53,420 --> 00:38:58,220
a and I came across that the I called
about a guy named Jon Lech Johansen

659
00:38:58,220 --> 00:39:01,640
who had written no video player for
Linux hear him

660
00:39:01,640 --> 00:39:06,160
a had your dinosaurs a desire to do it
in a playful antics

661
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:09,700
he'd been arrested a by the Norwegian
government

662
00:39:09,700 --> 00:39:13,740
at the behest the MPAA you know these
guys we have on the slide before

663
00:39:13,740 --> 00:39:18,590
nom for having done that and i got
really angry I said well actually I

664
00:39:18,590 --> 00:39:21,920
rather than running courage what I
really want to be doing

665
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:25,130
is defending the

666
00:39:25,130 --> 00:39:28,400
the internet against clown black

667
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:31,520
Mickey Mouse am

668
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:36,000
a sir so that was how I ended up you
know on the merger

669
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:39,290
studying copyright policy and can get
this line

670
00:39:39,290 --> 00:39:42,950
I'm staying copyright policy and looking
at AFF and then the question is how did

671
00:39:42,950 --> 00:39:44,910
I end up working on this design

672
00:39:44,910 --> 00:39:48,480
for privacy badger and actually that
came from running your script

673
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:52,640
and live rich we had another tools for
understanding of my brother was doing

674
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:56,160
and then I kept looking at what they
were doing

675
00:39:56,160 --> 00:40:00,760
what the brother was and what what the
hell why why is my bras ascending work

676
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:04,130
information about the page I'm on to a
dozen other

677
00:40:04,130 --> 00:40:07,170
companies I've never heard of have no
relationship with

678
00:40:07,170 --> 00:40:10,780
I started talks like George Soros yep

679
00:40:10,780 --> 00:40:15,930
um I started to unpack that and wrote a
blog post or three about it for FF

680
00:40:15,930 --> 00:40:20,220
and then that started you know the press
responded to that and that put us on the

681
00:40:20,220 --> 00:40:21,850
yellow brick road if you like

682
00:40:21,850 --> 00:40:28,850
to privacy better anyway thanks the
question

683
00:40:32,180 --> 00:40:35,570
I'm thank you for privacy badger

684
00:40:35,570 --> 00:40:42,210
we all appreciate it

685
00:40:42,210 --> 00:40:46,470
my question is invasive marketing

686
00:40:46,470 --> 00:40:51,620
on these people they do regard us as
people. this uses dollar signs the just

687
00:40:51,620 --> 00:40:54,180
don't give a damn about who we are

688
00:40:54,180 --> 00:40:57,450
okay so why should we give a damn about
them why not have

689
00:40:57,450 --> 00:41:00,640
stir privacy badger grow some friends

690
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:04,650
in have privacy beast in privacy be used
basically

691
00:41:04,650 --> 00:41:09,310
tinsel Zambales Shareef in jewelsburg
databases with garbage in short circuits

692
00:41:09,310 --> 00:41:11,360
their profit model

693
00:41:11,360 --> 00:41:15,170
us our Privacy Manager is a GPL is free
software

694
00:41:15,170 --> 00:41:22,170
am you the

695
00:41:25,770 --> 00:41:26,280
and your

696
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:30,900
Co

697
00:41:30,900 --> 00:41:32,910
the senate see where this goes in two
years

698
00:41:32,910 --> 00:41:36,469
I'm sure that you've heard of the

699
00:41:36,469 --> 00:41:39,640
the epic privacy browser I am yeah

700
00:41:39,640 --> 00:41:43,739
my question is how does our Privacy
Bazar Jimmy privacy measure compared to

701
00:41:43,739 --> 00:41:44,169
the

702
00:41:44,169 --> 00:41:47,910
mob to the features that a that epic has
in terms about tracking

703
00:41:47,910 --> 00:41:51,179
out so I haven't audit to compare

704
00:41:51,179 --> 00:41:54,599
I the thing that the versions of this
question I can answer

705
00:41:54,599 --> 00:41:58,429
%ah cursory a Adblock Plus

706
00:41:58,429 --> 00:42:01,779
and disconnect a

707
00:42:01,779 --> 00:42:06,979
in our experience um over those three

708
00:42:06,979 --> 00:42:10,699
dresser doesn't block much stuff by
default

709
00:42:10,699 --> 00:42:16,599
I in fact it's in our dress trees
produced by company that works for the

710
00:42:16,599 --> 00:42:20,109
advertising industry so that their first
function is to figure out what

711
00:42:20,109 --> 00:42:24,150
trackers are out there on the web so
they can sell that

712
00:42:24,150 --> 00:42:27,880
analytic service to those tracks
themselves too often sites don't know

713
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:29,009
what track as they have

714
00:42:29,009 --> 00:42:32,069
inside them because some web developer
included a

715
00:42:32,069 --> 00:42:35,359
a javascript in bed and that included
file a javascript in bed and

716
00:42:35,359 --> 00:42:39,689
no one ever figured out what was going
on sir nurseries primary function

717
00:42:39,689 --> 00:42:43,579
in life is to provide that data to the
advertising industry

718
00:42:43,579 --> 00:42:48,049
a secondary function is to your people
who care about privacy can manually go

719
00:42:48,049 --> 00:42:48,559
in

720
00:42:48,559 --> 00:42:52,939
and makers to stop blocking things abut
people who use it a lot to me

721
00:42:52,939 --> 00:42:55,929
that when you really go in and chill
down and try and make it but everything

722
00:42:55,929 --> 00:42:57,119
it winds up being true

723
00:42:57,119 --> 00:43:01,209
aggressive and and breaks a lot of stuff
Adblock Plus

724
00:43:01,209 --> 00:43:04,499
by default doesn't block any invisible

725
00:43:04,499 --> 00:43:07,949
JavaScript sir a

726
00:43:07,949 --> 00:43:12,179
it'll take out all the ads and from the
page but unless you go in some manually

727
00:43:12,179 --> 00:43:14,839
subscribe to read different block less
than the default

728
00:43:14,839 --> 00:43:19,099
your get protection against that kinda
tracking and so we wanted something that

729
00:43:19,099 --> 00:43:20,509
would just by default

730
00:43:20,509 --> 00:43:25,269
single click Install you that result I'm
disconnect we actually probably

731
00:43:25,269 --> 00:43:28,880
I like the the best first systems it's
pretty good

732
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:32,019
and we've been talking about
collaborating with them on the technical

733
00:43:32,019 --> 00:43:32,640
paces

734
00:43:32,640 --> 00:43:36,299
maintaining versions for all the
different platforms that are out there

735
00:43:36,299 --> 00:43:36,809
because

736
00:43:36,809 --> 00:43:40,880
the sky love engineering work to being
on mobile I'll be on crime being on fire

737
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:41,749
fighter

738
00:43:41,749 --> 00:43:46,630
by default it doesn't block any

739
00:43:46,630 --> 00:43:50,029
invisible trackers so if the page
contains like a one by one

740
00:43:50,029 --> 00:43:53,189
jeff is the classic version have any
visible tracker these days that's

741
00:43:53,189 --> 00:43:54,039
largely been

742
00:43:54,039 --> 00:43:57,539
replaced with JavaScript thats fetched

743
00:43:57,539 --> 00:44:00,599
and and does exit %uh perspectives

744
00:44:00,599 --> 00:44:04,519
to report information about you that
stuff by default it doesn't block

745
00:44:04,519 --> 00:44:08,479
when you all get the chance I'd love to
hear comparison at this verse is epic I

746
00:44:08,479 --> 00:44:11,519
use a pic but its unwieldy for certain
things that have to see how this

747
00:44:11,519 --> 00:44:18,519
stacks up alright will do that

748
00:44:19,860 --> 00:44:21,730
a hollow thank you again

749
00:44:21,730 --> 00:44:25,670
arm I'm a little confused about the way
it word

750
00:44:25,670 --> 00:44:28,840
retroactively handle cookies so let's
say that a service

751
00:44:28,840 --> 00:44:32,190
the gives you a cookie and it offers
privacy better says

752
00:44:32,190 --> 00:44:35,200
nothing fishy about this that's okay you
can put the cookie there

753
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:38,730
but then later it starts doing stuff
that starts to get blocked

754
00:44:38,730 --> 00:44:44,150
those privacy badger on do anything to
the pre-existing cookies does it stop

755
00:44:44,150 --> 00:44:46,680
them from being able to delete those
cookies or does it

756
00:44:46,680 --> 00:44:50,320
leave that point shall you there for the
already okay site some sir

757
00:44:50,320 --> 00:44:54,790
there by this is a good great question
um sorry to a follow-up

758
00:44:54,790 --> 00:44:59,360
with the ability to control the way that
the pricey measure and all those be in

759
00:44:59,360 --> 00:45:00,150
the settings

760
00:45:00,150 --> 00:45:04,710
yep sir a what privacy reg does the West
sees a third party

761
00:45:04,710 --> 00:45:08,270
remains it shows up in that loss
dropdown

762
00:45:08,270 --> 00:45:12,230
'em and Danny every time it sees a third
party to mean the first

763
00:45:12,230 --> 00:45:16,270
question asks is in this context does
that mean look like it tracking me

764
00:45:16,270 --> 00:45:19,610
and so it goes and looks at all the
cookies the in the

765
00:45:19,610 --> 00:45:23,880
cook east of the two main all being set
over the issue he has

766
00:45:23,880 --> 00:45:28,550
and it says I am is this cookie

767
00:45:28,550 --> 00:45:33,610
in our not obviously kirscher obviously
kosher cookie is something like

768
00:45:33,610 --> 00:45:37,160
cookie whose value is 1 10 true or false

769
00:45:37,160 --> 00:45:41,780
lani calls be an awesome other common
language kurd those cookies

770
00:45:41,780 --> 00:45:44,970
if the if there could be like that
actually does little entropy calculation

771
00:45:44,970 --> 00:45:47,800
for the total said all those cookies and
if it's below a

772
00:45:47,800 --> 00:45:51,520
your threshold outlets maybe not
tracking a.m.

773
00:45:51,520 --> 00:45:55,290
but if the cookies along and random
string

774
00:45:55,290 --> 00:45:59,330
I can identify our session token
whatever that looks like tracking

775
00:45:59,330 --> 00:46:04,320
and sorry but you are sometimes these
third-party domains are not really

776
00:46:04,320 --> 00:46:07,660
tracking domains they just a you know an
isolated sub-domains

777
00:46:07,660 --> 00:46:11,970
that the in Europe on a first-party
experience so it keeps a record

778
00:46:11,970 --> 00:46:15,270
how many first party to Maine's it seem
that

779
00:46:15,270 --> 00:46:19,900
third-party anise cookies on a fifth
season across more than three

780
00:46:19,900 --> 00:46:24,000
origins then it says oh wait a minute
this thing keeps

781
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:28,200
showing up in different places and its
in a position to know my reading habits

782
00:46:28,200 --> 00:46:29,420
not just on one side

783
00:46:29,420 --> 00:46:32,690
but on three along a case tracking so
that's

784
00:46:32,690 --> 00:46:37,410
what causes the a slider to move out at
the Green State in the browser

785
00:46:37,410 --> 00:46:40,720
whether it goes to red or yellow

786
00:46:40,720 --> 00:46:45,210
usually by default it'll go to read
unless we've gray listed said actually

787
00:46:45,210 --> 00:46:49,090
we found documented instances have this
domain being necessary functionality the

788
00:46:49,090 --> 00:46:49,880
user wants

789
00:46:49,880 --> 00:46:53,920
in which case we put into the our state
that means could be blocked

790
00:46:53,920 --> 00:46:58,070
a in that state we just do the third
party click it could be blocking

791
00:46:58,070 --> 00:47:01,490
operation we try to prevent the demand
from getting access to its cookies

792
00:47:01,490 --> 00:47:04,900
when it's a third party but if you go
back to that side

793
00:47:04,900 --> 00:47:08,570
as a first-party you'll have the cookie
again so an example where you want that

794
00:47:08,570 --> 00:47:09,520
is Google dot com

795
00:47:09,520 --> 00:47:12,670
you know when you go back to your look
calm may wanna be logged in

796
00:47:12,670 --> 00:47:15,870
to radio your male have a inner

797
00:47:15,870 --> 00:47:20,030
a login experience CEO get that but on
the third party context

798
00:47:20,030 --> 00:47:25,130
you be logged out after and then if you
want to manually change your privacy

799
00:47:25,130 --> 00:47:26,390
Badgers behaving

800
00:47:26,390 --> 00:47:30,200
you can just grab the slide is in the
drop down anytime in manually set them

801
00:47:30,200 --> 00:47:31,710
to any of those three states

802
00:47:31,710 --> 00:47:35,230
grain put is is to allow dealers could
be blocked

803
00:47:35,230 --> 00:47:39,190
readies completely blocked and so you
can choose how you want to handle

804
00:47:39,190 --> 00:47:46,000
yeah okay so if there is one thing we
all know that do not track is how she

805
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:49,680
say hard to enforce a great job making
software that actually does that

806
00:47:49,680 --> 00:47:54,230
%ah there's one thing that we could do
to fix the current mess over cookies and

807
00:47:54,230 --> 00:47:54,910
tracking

808
00:47:54,910 --> 00:47:58,790
technically do perhaps as a technical
cross prior browser standard

809
00:47:58,790 --> 00:48:02,220
because I do work a w3c what would that
one thing be

810
00:48:02,220 --> 00:48:05,370
RK crossed the question is

811
00:48:05,370 --> 00:48:10,200
a what one change to the web would we
want to make

812
00:48:10,200 --> 00:48:13,260
as across browse a standard cheer

813
00:48:13,260 --> 00:48:16,510
make the web banner and I think alone

814
00:48:16,510 --> 00:48:21,150
you know we tried that and the w3c what
we would have said was

815
00:48:21,150 --> 00:48:27,860
his day a strong policy document best
sites have to comply with

816
00:48:27,860 --> 00:48:31,830
a when they see i dnt one had a because

817
00:48:31,830 --> 00:48:35,050
you fine art if you and that you know
thus far has failed

818
00:48:35,050 --> 00:48:38,190
the w3c we'll see whether we can one day
inner

819
00:48:38,190 --> 00:48:42,270
few years down the track Privacy Manager
and other things like it get enough

820
00:48:42,270 --> 00:48:43,010
momentum

821
00:48:43,010 --> 00:48:46,530
home I maybe we can go back and have a
conversation again

822
00:48:46,530 --> 00:48:49,640
um but the problem is if

823
00:48:49,640 --> 00:48:53,180
you know if I can't have that policy
solution I'm stuck with

824
00:48:53,180 --> 00:48:56,450
okay I have to deal with her for as
cookies super cookies

825
00:48:56,450 --> 00:49:01,070
fingerprinting a all these different
tracking mechanisms like I give you a

826
00:49:01,070 --> 00:49:01,750
single

827
00:49:01,750 --> 00:49:08,750
on sir that solves all those manifold
problems at once

828
00:49:10,630 --> 00:49:14,920
yes a higher and so

829
00:49:14,920 --> 00:49:18,770
who what does respect for

830
00:49:18,770 --> 00:49:23,420
arm dnt like inhale if somebody's
tractor wants to be

831
00:49:23,420 --> 00:49:27,160
you know acceptable to you I that's a
great guy and a great question sir

832
00:49:27,160 --> 00:49:30,580
unfortunately I didn't have the slide on
this one minute

833
00:49:30,580 --> 00:49:33,820
and a if you go to it after Aug slash

834
00:49:33,820 --> 00:49:37,460
dnt hyphen policy you can read it

835
00:49:37,460 --> 00:49:40,900
the answer to that question the one
minute version is

836
00:49:40,900 --> 00:49:43,950
up if these is not logged in

837
00:49:43,950 --> 00:49:47,790
a you may just throw away all your
unique identifiers for them completely

838
00:49:47,790 --> 00:49:52,230
inner cookies that are unique in their
Super cookies if they are logged in

839
00:49:52,230 --> 00:49:57,600
um van your need to not keepers poss the
time when you've served their spacious

840
00:49:57,600 --> 00:50:01,830
he responds and then there's a lot of
compromises with reality that are in the

841
00:50:01,830 --> 00:50:02,820
documents it says

842
00:50:02,820 --> 00:50:06,910
yeah but if you have an explicit
transaction at the users engaged in like

843
00:50:06,910 --> 00:50:08,420
they're about to post a comment

844
00:50:08,420 --> 00:50:11,650
you can keep the data associated with
making that comment happen

845
00:50:11,650 --> 00:50:15,370
for as long as you need to and if year

846
00:50:15,370 --> 00:50:19,910
I have evidence that these attacking you
they're launching a security attack or

847
00:50:19,910 --> 00:50:21,750
they're engaged in click fraud or
whatever

848
00:50:21,750 --> 00:50:25,100
then in specific instances where your
system's believe that

849
00:50:25,100 --> 00:50:28,650
you can keep that data without complying
with the policy

850
00:50:28,650 --> 00:50:32,930
all but Yukon just launder violations
this

851
00:50:32,930 --> 00:50:36,230
through third or fourth party so you're
obligated to make sure

852
00:50:36,230 --> 00:50:40,040
if you in bed a list of it also complies
with with this policy

853
00:50:40,040 --> 00:50:43,600
to basically it so you know about a two-
to three-page document the tries to

854
00:50:43,600 --> 00:50:45,420
navigate all of those

855
00:50:45,420 --> 00:50:49,090
there's things in a way that we think is
seriously privacy-preserving

856
00:50:49,090 --> 00:50:52,850
but also something that a large-scale
web site could realistically implement

857
00:50:52,850 --> 00:50:53,200
and we've

858
00:50:53,200 --> 00:50:56,230
we've been going around talking to
people and hearing

859
00:50:56,230 --> 00:51:00,760
yeah this is a hard task for us but we
think we can do it

860
00:51:00,760 --> 00:51:04,080
ok actually we have this yeah

861
00:51:04,080 --> 00:51:07,670
actually at me and I wanna say there are
actually some significant web sites that

862
00:51:07,670 --> 00:51:08,800
you guys use

863
00:51:08,800 --> 00:51:13,230
that now doing this sir will beat us a
more about who they are

864
00:51:13,230 --> 00:51:17,140
and doing a big home you're a big press
release about it when we have a

865
00:51:17,140 --> 00:51:21,020
you know maybe a dozen of them

866
00:51:21,020 --> 00:51:24,200
that in the orange cookie block state

867
00:51:24,200 --> 00:51:27,200
is it just HTTP cookies that are a

868
00:51:27,200 --> 00:51:30,250
blocked or not send or are there other

869
00:51:30,250 --> 00:51:33,750
strong identifiers that are prevented
out so that some roulette

870
00:51:33,750 --> 00:51:37,180
in our at the moment Rieger SUV cookies
and maybe

871
00:51:37,180 --> 00:51:41,510
Daum super who he is we aim to do all of
them but its development work and we

872
00:51:41,510 --> 00:51:41,780
could

873
00:51:41,780 --> 00:51:45,140
we can use pull request for some other
stuff especially anyone has a really

874
00:51:45,140 --> 00:51:46,380
good flash hacker

875
00:51:46,380 --> 00:51:50,100
we could probably use your help dealing
with flash because it's such a

876
00:51:50,100 --> 00:51:55,210
hard thing to control from the process

877
00:51:55,210 --> 00:51:58,660
all rights um I don't think we have more
questions as well like I think this is

878
00:51:58,660 --> 00:52:01,830
on my slides while so wanted to shout
out I know a number if you're in the

879
00:52:01,830 --> 00:52:02,590
audience

880
00:52:02,590 --> 00:52:06,250
um people who actually help to write the
code for this project religious

881
00:52:06,250 --> 00:52:09,640
you know a minority of that I'll your
answer and

882

1037
01:08:03,119 --> 01:08:06,550
more people speaking about particular
things by this really I i 10

1038
01:08:06,550 --> 01:08:11,220
definitely recognize the efforts have a
V in this particular

1039
01:08:11,220 --> 01:08:16,089
on conferences been phenomenal by Adam

1040
01:08:16,089 --> 01:08:19,350
I love you I'm blown away

1041
01:08:19,350 --> 01:08:22,980
just just for you guys accomplished
yesterday

1042
01:08:22,980 --> 01:08:26,210
getting every snowden on getting the
connection going

1043
01:08:26,210 --> 01:08:29,469
we heard from people at South by
Southwest you're done this that

1044
01:08:29,469 --> 01:08:32,640
we did so much better as far as getting
it to work which is

1045
01:08:32,640 --> 01:08:36,160
always good to hear arm and of course

1046
01:08:36,160 --> 01:08:39,529
there are so many efforts people here to
say a few words about

1047
01:08:39,529 --> 01:08:43,120
very things that have gone on are one
other things I really want to

1048
01:08:43,120 --> 01:08:46,739
I recognize on is the network itself

1049
01:08:46,739 --> 01:08:51,440
because the network is something
unprecedented here we had 50 megabit

1050
01:08:51,440 --> 01:08:54,679
in 2012 and

1051
01:08:54,679 --> 01:08:57,690
we weren't sure a few weeks ago we

1052
01:08:57,690 --> 01:08:59,969
you heard about the whole thing with the
distributor we have all kinds of

1053
01:08:59,969 --> 01:09:01,960
financial issues and we weren't even
sure

1054
01:09:01,960 --> 01:09:05,350
we're going to be able to get the same
net connectivity

1055
01:09:05,350 --> 01:09:08,580
we thinking you know having
conversations it's not really about the

1056
01:09:08,580 --> 01:09:10,440
network right people can come here in
this

1057
01:09:10,440 --> 01:09:13,690
watch the talks out that'll be fine ride
know is gonna complain

1058
01:09:13,690 --> 01:09:17,319
and yeah liau arm

1059
01:09:17,319 --> 01:09:20,880
and and just you know when things were
on at their darkest

1060
01:09:20,880 --> 01:09:24,719
on Carl here who are set up the network
decided that he was going to

1061
01:09:24,719 --> 01:09:29,230
go out and get an even better network
than we had before and that's how we

1062
01:09:29,230 --> 01:09:32,029
wound up with a network to 100 times
faster

1063
01:09:32,029 --> 01:09:36,310
just when we thought we couldn't do it
at all and that a hacker spirits right

1064
01:09:36,310 --> 01:09:43,310
the

1065
01:09:45,480 --> 01:09:52,480
this is the guy to thank for this is
Highland Dr he's got some people the

1066
01:09:52,779 --> 01:09:58,280
the either arm

1067
01:09:58,280 --> 01:10:01,769
Nike toll lotta really amazing long
stories on

1068
01:10:01,769 --> 01:10:04,900

1070
01:10:09,249 --> 01:10:13,630

hurricane for a while but we've never

1071
01:10:13,630 --> 01:10:15,179
been able to make it happen

1072
01:10:15,179 --> 01:10:19,030
on and it was getting really close we
had some problems

1073
01:10:19,030 --> 01:10:22,820
a.m. getting permission with the hotel
and

1074
01:10:22,820 --> 01:10:26,570
obviously them the management situations
been changing a lot here lately anyway

1075
01:10:26,570 --> 01:10:27,219
I'm

1076
01:10:27,219 --> 01:10:31,900
fast-forward the contract nothing was
really happening it didn't people

1077
01:10:31,900 --> 01:10:34,190
weren't talking and we were getting
permission to

1078
01:10:34,190 --> 01:10:38,619
do the microwave fast enough and i got
really frustrated with how long it was

1079
01:10:38,619 --> 01:10:40,940
taking cuz we had like a month ago

1080
01:10:40,940 --> 01:10:44,019
arm so I A arm I made a

1081
01:10:44,019 --> 01:10:48,769
an inquiry to the people are CNN Denmark
I reported back to my network team which

1082
01:10:48,769 --> 01:10:49,210
is

1083
01:10:49,210 --> 01:10:53,559
freaking amazing you're gonna meet I am
pretty much the core guys and a lot of

1084
01:10:53,559 --> 01:10:53,820
them

1085
01:10:53,820 --> 01:10:57,070
in a minute um anyway a.m.

1086
01:10:57,070 --> 01:11:00,229
in love dusts discuss in detail exactly
how that went down

1087
01:11:00,229 --> 01:11:03,519
I so basically in the last month

1088
01:11:03,519 --> 01:11:07,719
we got the right people together and it
was a a really interesting coincidence

1089
01:11:07,719 --> 01:11:11,320
love I am certain people getting
involved in getting the right people

1090
01:11:11,320 --> 01:11:12,170
talking

1091
01:11:12,170 --> 01:11:17,170
on I'm really just interested people ask
me so what is your interest in leading

1092
01:11:17,170 --> 01:11:18,099
the NACA

1093
01:11:18,099 --> 01:11:22,360
what is interesting in doing this and I
said wall I'm a hacker am really

1094
01:11:22,360 --> 01:11:24,460
interested in this stuff and I'm not
really doing this

1095
01:11:24,460 --> 01:11:27,590
regularly but I know enough about it and
I'm interested enough to

1096
01:11:27,590 --> 01:11:31,190
arm think an ideal I can push it forward
so

1097
01:11:31,190 --> 01:11:35,110
that was really my goal but I knew I
needed a lot I'll ton of help

1098
01:11:35,110 --> 01:11:39,579
to do it arm so the anyway I i

1099
01:11:39,579 --> 01:11:43,010
I'm not gonna get into it absolutely
like all the details of how those

1100
01:11:43,010 --> 01:11:44,670
communications when and what it took

1101
01:11:44,670 --> 01:11:48,590
so arm cuz I've I think the guys are
gonna lay it out pretty clearly what we

1102
01:11:48,590 --> 01:11:49,570
ended up with

1103
01:11:49,570 --> 01:11:53,530
but arm we eventually worked with our
CNN got

1104
01:11:53,530 --> 01:11:56,550
patch and and then it was

1105
01:11:56,550 --> 01:12:01,019
weeks uncertainty about permission
exactly with the hotel would allow us to

1106
01:12:01,019 --> 01:12:01,479
do

1107
01:12:01,479 --> 01:12:08,070
arm anyway I again it's really it took a
long time and I was really uncertain and

1108
01:12:08,070 --> 01:12:09,690
frankly scared to death that

1109
01:12:09,690 --> 01:12:12,840
I am I was going to disappoint and well
we

1110
01:12:12,840 --> 01:12:15,860
we have a whole new scorer in the net in
the NOC

1111
01:12:15,860 --> 01:12:19,130
and well its it's a whole new team and
at that

1112
01:12:19,130 --> 01:12:22,729
itself was really odd because I was
creating teams have people that I hadn't

1113
01:12:22,729 --> 01:12:24,840
met and that probably hadn't met each
other

1114
01:12:24,840 --> 01:12:27,869
on so that additionally made it kinda

1115
01:12:27,869 --> 01:12:31,150
the really nervous add nerve-wracking so

1116
01:12:31,150 --> 01:12:35,659
I without further ado I'm just gonna
think everybody I could think over the

1117
01:12:35,659 --> 01:12:38,639
last couple days when in between doing
other stuff and then

1118
01:12:38,639 --> 01:12:42,079
I and the rest the story I think we're
going to share with you during our

1119
01:12:42,079 --> 01:12:42,920
presentation

1120
01:12:42,920 --> 01:12:46,150
so um first off I'd like to thank a
manual for

1121
01:12:46,150 --> 01:12:49,340
a believing in me and letting me kinda

1122
01:12:49,340 --> 01:12:52,400
run with the ball and Sue we could do
arm

1123
01:12:52,400 --> 01:12:55,729
I'd also like to thank me fly he
couldn't be here but he

1124
01:12:55,729 --> 01:12:59,050
help set up I a lot of other connections
at all select

1125
01:12:59,050 --> 01:13:03,739
ahead people connections to get talking
to the right people and get us moving

1126
01:13:03,739 --> 01:13:07,849
a weenie also helped a lot with the
design sinus early

1127
01:13:07,849 --> 01:13:11,909
network stuff but he was very involved
remotely I am from Germany

1128
01:13:11,909 --> 01:13:16,380
and on a related note neil's I from the
CCC

1129
01:13:16,380 --> 01:13:19,920
and the c3 knock in general arm they her

1130
01:13:19,920 --> 01:13:23,550
good friend of mine put out a earning
career over

1131
01:13:23,550 --> 01:13:27,269
Twitter and stuff like that and they
actually talked about it and came up

1132
01:13:27,269 --> 01:13:27,769
with

1133
01:13:27,769 --> 01:13:30,780
well what they could do and to that end

1134
01:13:30,780 --> 01:13:35,249
some attila who you mean a second was
able to communicate with me

1135
01:13:35,249 --> 01:13:38,460
and sort out stuff a with wireless and

1136
01:13:38,460 --> 01:13:42,860
a lot of other core stuff that we put
together I might also like to thank drag

1137
01:13:42,860 --> 01:13:46,409
on who's our previous not believe he did
a fantastic job

1138
01:13:46,409 --> 01:13:50,360
from doing a writeup what he done in the
past and we were able to use that as a

1139
01:13:50,360 --> 01:13:51,030
template

1140
01:13:51,030 --> 01:13:55,440
and take the good from it and then
improve on what we thought was feasible

1141
01:13:55,440 --> 01:13:58,800
arm also policy a

1142
01:13:58,800 --> 01:14:02,030

arm hold back to people from our group
that

1144

building on that are moments in Cisco

1173
01:16:21,210 --> 01:16:24,400
we're gonna do but I'd really like to
relish the moment and the

1174
01:16:24,400 --> 01:16:28,900
arm well really thrilled at on the
president we've set

1175
01:16:28,900 --> 01:16:32,800
because I'm well I think it can only
improve from here

1176
01:16:32,800 --> 01:16:35,960
I am really honored to have been able to
lead in

1177
01:16:35,960 --> 01:16:38,870
and and have met a lot of new people
that I think ur gonna stick around

1178
01:16:38,870 --> 01:16:41,040
especially a and including a provider's

1179
01:16:41,040 --> 01:16:44,820
I also like to thank I'll do it on
mental health of

1180
01:16:44,820 --> 01:16:48,200
a lower out financially to mandrel
big-time

1181
01:16:48,200 --> 01:16:51,269
because we eventually got the cost of
patching it

1182
01:16:51,270 --> 01:16:54,440
in connecting it p4 so that's pretty
cool

1183
01:16:54,440 --> 01:17:01,440
as it was essentially free so

1184
01:17:02,969 --> 01:17:06,600
those are all the people I could think I
know there's a ton more people I'm

1185
01:17:06,600 --> 01:17:08,150
really really sorry I just

1186
01:17:08,150 --> 01:17:15,150
I'd and a lot I seventy though where
pallets stacked up on the way

1187
01:17:15,200 --> 01:17:18,400
how do you know if they were really busy
time you know we get all the equipment

1188
01:17:18,400 --> 01:17:19,510
company and it was really

1189
01:17:19,510 --> 01:17:26,510
hey I am I thought we had all these
packages the shut up Louis

1190
01:17:27,430 --> 01:17:30,730
arm so

1191
01:17:30,730 --> 01:17:33,870
anyway with that I would like to
introduce arm

1192
01:17:33,870 --> 01:17:39,370
our current knock team and do a really
cool presentation on what the fuck

1193
01:17:39,370 --> 01:17:46,370
actually happen

1194
01:17:50,390 --> 01:17:52,290
everybody so

1195
01:17:52,290 --> 01:17:56,230
I first gotta say the an intro was
fantastic

1196
01:17:56,230 --> 01:18:00,080
covered a lot of the bases I may go
through really quick

1197
01:18:00,080 --> 01:18:03,660
just some in the background you know
what exactly we did here

1198
01:18:03,660 --> 01:18:07,060
however the paw print and ATM and

1199
01:18:07,060 --> 01:18:10,820
help you push for Bama cell

1200
01:18:10,820 --> 01:18:14,370
are start ask how was saying we were
asked that

1201
01:18:14,370 --> 01:18:17,500
he asked the see CCC

1202
01:18:17,500 --> 01:18:21,440
rc3 knock a month prior to who if they
could assist with running the network

1203
01:18:21,440 --> 01:18:22,410
this year

1204
01:18:22,410 --> 01:18:25,440

1206
01:18:30,090 --> 01:18:31,390
issues that there are facing

1207
01:18:31,390 --> 01:18:37,150
in less than two weeks seven business
days to be exact we managed to get

1208
01:18:37,150 --> 01:18:40,410
engage the connected to be established
to the hotel Pennsylvania

1209
01:18:40,410 --> 01:18:46,000

1210
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:50,830
hi I would definitely call that america
I've never seen tokars work so fast

1211
01:18:50,830 --> 01:18:54,210
the coordination that

1212
01:18:54,210 --> 01:18:57,230
took place an order for that to occur
now we got 10 Diego

1213
01:18:57,230 --> 01:19:01,530
transport activity from RCN to 111 8th
Avenue

1214
01:19:01,530 --> 01:19:05,220
now which is the Google Data Center
iight and Equinix

1215
01:19:05,220 --> 01:19:08,810
we got across tech between our CNN Ichi
on

1216
01:19:08,810 --> 01:19:11,900
we got ten-day transit sponsored by
hurricane electric

1217
01:19:11,900 --> 01:19:16,240
we had to get hello Is and from two
different service providers in order to

1218
01:19:16,240 --> 01:19:18,370
get the IP space that we needed to run
the network
