1
00:00:03,100 --> 00:00:06,430
right so without their without further
do it for my pleasure to present the

2
00:00:06,430 --> 00:00:07,769
Internet Society speaks

3
00:00:07,769 --> 00:00:14,769
on this John Terry pester and David
Solomon of on thank you thank you

4
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:19,430
hello ladies and gentleman and a
extremely bright lights

5
00:00:19,430 --> 00:00:22,760
I so now that I can see any view

6
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:26,260
but I like to take a quick call before
we begin how many have you would say

7
00:00:26,260 --> 00:00:28,920
that you are involved in Internet
governance issues

8
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:32,330
alright as conceivably eg

9
00:00:32,330 --> 00:00:36,200
two or three hands how many have you
have 'em call your congressmen are

10
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:40,940
so gotta was got involved in the net
neutrality debates I got news for you

11
00:00:40,940 --> 00:00:42,180
and all the Internet Governance

12
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:46,059
and as we get for as you got this
presentation you're going to see why

13
00:00:46,059 --> 00:00:50,350
but right now let's get started with the
history but Internet Governance

14
00:00:50,350 --> 00:00:54,010
where to go all the way from the very
beginning all the way

15
00:00:54,010 --> 00:00:57,550
to the possible and zany futures cell

16
00:00:57,550 --> 00:01:03,340
so let's talk about how the internet
actually began

17
00:01:03,340 --> 00:01:06,650
this began in the mind of JC I look
later when he

18
00:01:06,650 --> 00:01:09,730
envisions the intergalactic network that
was going to

19
00:01:09,730 --> 00:01:13,210
link all the computers in the world
together up which there are maybe

20
00:01:13,210 --> 00:01:16,260
on the order of 10 to 20 so

21
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:19,380
you can imagine why would we need to
link these things together and

22
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:22,680
you know these days it sounds like a
foregone conclusion but

23
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:26,480
think what computers were like then
these were giant information processing

24
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:27,140
machines

25
00:01:27,140 --> 00:01:30,880
use fed data into them and got data back
out of them

26
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:34,000
you know there was no questions have
using them to learn

27
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,150
two-out really research things or two
I'm

28
00:01:37,150 --> 00:01:40,620
find novel discussed and pineapple
discoveries beyond what you already do

29
00:01:40,620 --> 00:01:42,100
with your data they were just giant

30
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:45,330
room size bulky items I know this guy
want to link them together for some

31
00:01:45,330 --> 00:01:45,880
reason

32
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:49,760
that is your look let only had a small
two-year tenure at

33
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:53,760
arpa where he was sorry but was able to
get off the ground at that point so is

34
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:54,210
Brooke

35
00:01:54,210 --> 00:01:57,890
Robert Taylor's but as I was the one who
actually did it and later claim rock at

36
00:01:57,890 --> 00:02:00,270
UCLA hosted what are the first notes

37
00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:03,800
Kleinrock was found eight had published
research in the packet switching

38
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:04,410
technique

39
00:02:04,410 --> 00:02:09,080
that we don't know and love today and
his grad students min surf

40
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:13,590
steve crocker and John pa still and
deforming something called the network

41
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:14,450
working group

42
00:02:14,450 --> 00:02:18,190
to illicit and to discuss new ideas for
this emerging

43
00:02:18,190 --> 00:02:21,360
ARPA network in the sought requests for
comment sir

44
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:25,170
RC on up in its development now

45
00:02:25,170 --> 00:02:28,300
the cool thing about the Network working
group is that anyone could participate

46
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:31,540
of course when we're talking about a
network of four notes that's not really

47
00:02:31,540 --> 00:02:32,680
a whole lotta people

48
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:36,350
but the good news is that as we got more
nodes we got more people and since the

49
00:02:36,350 --> 00:02:39,420
object of the group was to talk about
the network it was sort of a

50
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:43,390
self propagating and beneficial feedback
loop people

51
00:02:43,390 --> 00:02:46,270
anybody who wanted to get involved was
really able to when there was no

52
00:02:46,270 --> 00:02:47,030
question

53
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:51,520
%uh exclusion or backlash as long as you
work able to play nice with other people

54
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:55,380
and because people were collaborating in
working together they were able to

55
00:02:55,380 --> 00:02:56,270
develop book

56
00:02:56,270 --> 00:02:59,900
lot of a foundational protocols and
software

57
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:03,770
that a foundation to the Internet today
such as email that was a combination

58
00:03:03,770 --> 00:03:07,220
up the already just the FTP protocol
possum messaging systems

59
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:12,220
a customized for different nodes in the
network so

60
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:15,880
as you open it continue to develop
people realize that this packet

61
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:17,990
switching network thing was actually
pretty cool idea

62
00:03:17,990 --> 00:03:21,870
and they start other started to prop it
up we had the Aloha nets

63
00:03:21,870 --> 00:03:26,400
and in the eighties the SF nets and a
few other network BBN was trying to

64
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:27,790
establish its own network

65
00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:31,330
I think IBM was as well so before we
know we had dozens a

66
00:03:31,330 --> 00:03:34,350
work maybe not dozens but I hope born to
differ packet switching networks the

67
00:03:34,350 --> 00:03:35,700
problem is they'll work differently

68
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:39,310
the ARPANET had these interface
messaging protocols that so to govern

69
00:03:39,310 --> 00:03:39,870
how

70
00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:43,010
Pat traffic was directed but others work
differently

71
00:03:43,010 --> 00:03:46,780
and he was just these were all kind of
on their own networks these railroads

72
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:48,069
with no interconnection

73
00:03:48,069 --> 00:03:51,870
and so then surf & Baba Khan

74
00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:54,880
develop the transmission control
protocol and

75
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:58,470
that lately they call the transmission
control protocol slush Internet Protocol

76
00:03:58,470 --> 00:04:02,060
the idea being that they could use this
protocol to internetwork

77
00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:05,620
the networks it didn't matter what kinda
day to you were sending

78
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:08,599
tcp/ip he was just focused on getting
the data from one place to the other

79
00:04:08,599 --> 00:04:09,240
then

80
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:11,580
the networks could do with it as they
wanted to the concert their own

81
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:13,530
protocols and close to the end points

82
00:04:13,530 --> 00:04:17,579
well as cool but the TCP IP protocol is
that was open source

83
00:04:17,579 --> 00:04:21,350
what we know today as open source
because they just shot about to that

84
00:04:21,350 --> 00:04:22,750
work working group and said here

85
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:25,740
look at this thing what do you think a
bit and then they were able to take it

86
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:27,490
and improve upon and eventually

87
00:04:27,490 --> 00:04:31,500
implemented on the emerging popular UNIX
system in the late night in the late

88
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:34,380
eighties as his house on computers
became very popular

89
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:37,880
because you could include TCPIP at no
extra cost

90
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:43,230
again seems the given today but at that
point was most definitely not

91
00:04:43,230 --> 00:04:46,820
so no getting a privatization as I said

92
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:51,520
they're all these different networks and
so see TCPIP kinda made it as a on

93
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:54,460
kinda you know glued all these things
together but it was a rickety operation

94
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:55,240
at best

95
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:58,639
and not only that these networks for use
primarily for academic or extremely

96
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:00,130
geeky purposes

97
00:05:00,130 --> 00:05:03,250
the idea the average user having
anything to do with the internet was

98
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:03,919
still

99
00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:07,570
but nowhere on the table but that a
little something called the world wide

100
00:05:07,570 --> 00:05:08,660
web came around

101
00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:12,480
and people started to take notice
suddenly there was human readable text

102
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:16,350
yet you could change the font and style
of this was amazing the idea of having

103
00:05:16,350 --> 00:05:17,370
graphics

104
00:05:17,370 --> 00:05:21,850
graphical user interfaces for the web
you know this was this was big stuff

105
00:05:21,850 --> 00:05:26,290
in the late eighties an early nineties
and so people so does realize hey maybe

106
00:05:26,290 --> 00:05:26,870
this

107
00:05:26,870 --> 00:05:30,470
network this internet could actually be
useful for but the general public people

108
00:05:30,470 --> 00:05:31,610
like you and me

109
00:05:31,610 --> 00:05:35,070
and so expansion started to they want to
expand it

110
00:05:35,070 --> 00:05:38,500
but the internet but the Internet and
its relevant

111
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:42,350
smaller networks were being run by
academic institutions in the ns7

112
00:05:42,350 --> 00:05:45,370
other organizations that really had no
business in trying to

113
00:05:45,370 --> 00:05:49,030
service a network for the general public
so this %ah privatization as the means

114
00:05:49,030 --> 00:05:49,740
to go

115
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:53,710
are as the way to go Telecom's like AT&T

116
00:05:53,710 --> 00:05:56,900
good certainly take this over and add
you know this new

117
00:05:56,900 --> 00:06:01,010
internet to their already existing
copper telephone lights

118
00:06:01,010 --> 00:06:05,150
and this is how we had our little fun
known as dial-up

119
00:06:05,150 --> 00:06:08,500
so it so that's how the network started
to become

120
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:11,669
accessible to the average person in the
early nineties but there was another

121
00:06:11,669 --> 00:06:15,190
aspect to this and this is where the
whole governance thing starts to come in

122
00:06:15,190 --> 00:06:19,010
a we may you know you know for its you
know the internet inventor al gore

123
00:06:19,010 --> 00:06:22,280
art became vice president in the

124
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:25,639
early nineties and she had been working
on technology issues

125
00:06:25,639 --> 00:06:29,680
for a couple of decades prior and once
he was in the vice presidency

126
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:33,030
he was really able to make this a
central component I love

127
00:06:33,030 --> 00:06:36,389
the administration and you the

128
00:06:36,389 --> 00:06:39,620
came up with this term little the
information superhighway is the one that

129
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:41,360
stuck but for policy purposes

130
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:44,410
this was all refer to as the national
information infrastructure

131
00:06:44,410 --> 00:06:48,199
this emerging technological network that
was going to better the lives

132
00:06:48,199 --> 00:06:52,449
a everyone around them so they set up
some information infrastructure task

133
00:06:52,449 --> 00:06:53,110
force's

134
00:06:53,110 --> 00:06:56,419
to discuss summer these technology
policy issues that they could foresee a

135
00:06:56,419 --> 00:06:57,190
rising

136
00:06:57,190 --> 00:07:00,759
as this internet became common now for
those have you were curious about the

137
00:07:00,759 --> 00:07:02,720
1996 telecom act too bad

138
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:06,280
this is occurring in a difference or
space the one about to talk about

139
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:10,060
and was really were centered at the FCC
about to talk about stuff that was more

140
00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:13,490
focused at the white house and
Department of Commerce

141
00:07:13,490 --> 00:07:17,759
so before we get to that I one thing I
want to mention is that

142
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:20,759
this was not simply an american
initiative a lot to this was happening

143
00:07:20,759 --> 00:07:22,280
in the American white house

144
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:25,660
but they recognize that this was going
to be a global phenomenon

145
00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:29,229
so so many the people involved were not
only just working here but they were

146
00:07:29,229 --> 00:07:30,570
going to meetings abroad

147
00:07:30,570 --> 00:07:33,680
they were trying to talk about how can
we connect to users

148
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:37,710
abroad users in Europe euthanasia users
in Africa

149
00:07:37,710 --> 00:07:41,229
these are questions even then even
before the internet was

150
00:07:41,229 --> 00:07:44,430
as prevalent anywhere near as prevalent
as it is today

151
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:47,690
and they stroll Ford you know generally

152
00:07:47,690 --> 00:07:50,889
admirable goals universal access an open
competition

153
00:07:50,889 --> 00:07:54,330
and different %uh settings that could
make the internet easily

154
00:07:54,330 --> 00:07:57,639
usable and accessible by anyone

155
00:07:57,639 --> 00:08:01,690
now e-commerce was actually pretty big
topic that got a lot of attention

156
00:08:01,690 --> 00:08:05,120
particularly when we're talking about
international commerce now buying stuff

157
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:05,910
on the web

158
00:08:05,910 --> 00:08:10,039
no big deal today right but of course it
we're talking about a network that would

159
00:08:10,039 --> 00:08:11,030
in the late eighties

160
00:08:11,030 --> 00:08:14,949
was used strictly for research purposes
in effect was forbidden from having any

161
00:08:14,949 --> 00:08:16,690
commercial content posted to it

162
00:08:16,690 --> 00:08:20,110
think about that they were trying to
talk about e-commerce on a network with

163
00:08:20,110 --> 00:08:21,509
that kind of history

164
00:08:21,509 --> 00:08:25,259
and not only that try to talk for think
about e-commerce

165
00:08:25,259 --> 00:08:29,030
between nations which have vastly
different tax laws differ and different

166
00:08:29,030 --> 00:08:30,759
other subtle but regulations

167
00:08:30,759 --> 00:08:34,869
we're talking about when to buy and sell
things this is huge and security mobile

168
00:08:34,869 --> 00:08:36,069
payment I mean

169
00:08:36,069 --> 00:08:38,729
we're talking about big we're talking
about issues that people are still

170
00:08:38,729 --> 00:08:40,360
grappling with today

171
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:44,099
at a time before the Internet was in
everyone's homes

172
00:08:44,099 --> 00:08:47,889
so but it was a good thing to be able to
put on the internet as people

173
00:08:47,889 --> 00:08:51,819
are started using it because people want
to buy things and

174
00:08:51,819 --> 00:08:55,499
sold done so a lot of people were had
their different opinions on it

175
00:08:55,499 --> 00:08:58,529
but the it really started to make
headway when clinton the clinton

176
00:08:58,529 --> 00:08:59,939
administration set up its own little

177
00:08:59,939 --> 00:09:04,540
interagency group among the different
government agencies to talk about this

178
00:09:04,540 --> 00:09:08,540
up but that really couldn't ever figure
out a government solution and I haven't

179
00:09:08,540 --> 00:09:10,149
done much research on the modern

180
00:09:10,149 --> 00:09:16,350
a issues up e-commerce but I think
they're still trying to figure it out

181
00:09:16,350 --> 00:09:19,259
so now we have to talk to the question
get back to the question of who was

182
00:09:19,259 --> 00:09:20,999
actually at the table for these things

183
00:09:20,999 --> 00:09:23,410
they're all these committees and all
these discussions that group that's

184
00:09:23,410 --> 00:09:24,069
great

185
00:09:24,069 --> 00:09:27,769
but as I was mentioning so far was
really mostly from the government

186
00:09:27,769 --> 00:09:31,139
and so the Department of Commerce to
establish committees for

187
00:09:31,139 --> 00:09:34,410
several key issues apart from the ones
already mentioned including intellectual

188
00:09:34,410 --> 00:09:37,339
property an online privacy in government
information

189
00:09:37,339 --> 00:09:41,629
those purple those ok committees each
publish very key reports

190
00:09:41,629 --> 00:09:45,519
and butts the reports had different
levels effects

191
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:49,160
the privacy paper was really sort out
much about this like well you know

192
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:52,610
you if your company using personal
information you should probably tell

193
00:09:52,610 --> 00:09:55,269
your users with the using it for simple
right

194
00:09:55,269 --> 00:09:59,240
and it but the IP intellectual property
committee

195
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:03,749
was a whole different story they publish
very strict in specific recommendations

196
00:10:03,749 --> 00:10:06,989
in favor of copyright holders their
logic was well

197
00:10:06,989 --> 00:10:10,660
the Internet is here but we've got to
fill it with content and less content

198
00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:11,600
providers are

199
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:15,579
confident that the content is secure
they won't be putting their content onto

200
00:10:15,579 --> 00:10:16,369
the internet

201
00:10:16,369 --> 00:10:20,519
it seems kinda logical but then the
kinda miss the step where users generate

202
00:10:20,519 --> 00:10:22,339
content themselves

203
00:10:22,339 --> 00:10:26,009
and this whole new title the idea of
information sharing that is arisen since

204
00:10:26,009 --> 00:10:27,660
them

205
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:32,389
so there was a lot of internet outrage
and in coordination even the nineties

206
00:10:32,389 --> 00:10:37,819
around issues like these there was a a
particularly around universities

207
00:10:37,819 --> 00:10:41,869
and libraries and other types of digital
digital up

208
00:10:41,869 --> 00:10:46,339
eggheads who kinda saw these Inc these
IP laws as as threatening to them

209
00:10:46,339 --> 00:10:50,389
they really are were concerned that if
these recommendations

210
00:10:50,389 --> 00:10:53,970
worded as specifically as they were put
into place now all the sudden the

211
00:10:53,970 --> 00:10:57,410
internet might you know turn into a
place that was a little less desirable

212
00:10:57,410 --> 00:11:00,939
for them to be for them to be working
and did this is without the benefit of

213
00:11:00,939 --> 00:11:03,980
hindsight that we have today

214
00:11:03,980 --> 00:11:07,699
'em there were other there was other arm
there was another

215
00:11:07,699 --> 00:11:10,809
organization called the Advisory Council
separate from the committees that I just

216
00:11:10,809 --> 00:11:11,869
talked about

217
00:11:11,869 --> 00:11:14,709
know this was interesting because these
were compiled this was comprised of

218
00:11:14,709 --> 00:11:15,309
people from

219
00:11:15,309 --> 00:11:18,679
outside government everything else I was
talking about to this point was made up

220
00:11:18,679 --> 00:11:22,170
people already inside government the
federal government but this council

221
00:11:22,170 --> 00:11:23,739
include people from education

222
00:11:23,739 --> 00:11:27,439
could people from universities from
research

223
00:11:27,439 --> 00:11:30,569
from telecom companies from technology
from Big Medium

224
00:11:30,569 --> 00:11:33,739
et cetera et cetera so we're talking
about a account so that was a one-point

225
00:11:33,739 --> 00:11:36,579
thirty-seven people strong from all
these different areas

226
00:11:36,579 --> 00:11:40,089
now he might imagine that having all
these people in the same room

227
00:11:40,089 --> 00:11:43,449
was great we get also to debate going on
and all sorts of

228
00:11:43,449 --> 00:11:47,649
ID is being exchanged but then it kinda
comes hard to come to consensus if this

229
00:11:47,649 --> 00:11:50,600
committee with all these different
people's expected publish something

230
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:54,100
well what exactly can you expect them to
publish

231
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:57,579
the result were these was this these
sorts of reports that we're very broad

232
00:11:57,579 --> 00:11:59,910
and high level in terms of what they
discussed

233
00:11:59,910 --> 00:12:03,410
you know we want to talk about educating
users on these capabilities wanna talk

234
00:12:03,410 --> 00:12:06,029
about getting internet into hands people
want to talk about

235
00:12:06,029 --> 00:12:09,739
people being secure their information
but also information being able to be

236
00:12:09,739 --> 00:12:10,399
used

237
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:14,129
for opportunities lie commerce and we
want to property but should be protected

238
00:12:14,129 --> 00:12:14,869
nothing

239
00:12:14,869 --> 00:12:18,639
that really sounds terribly
objectionable but it was very broad and

240
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:19,449
high level

241
00:12:19,449 --> 00:12:23,269
and represented really the base
agreement of what the

242
00:12:23,269 --> 00:12:26,790
such a diverse group of people were able
to come to him but

243
00:12:26,790 --> 00:12:29,869
know as I mentioned that he had that
thing with the IP committee and there's

244
00:12:29,869 --> 00:12:31,170
a very specific rules

245
00:12:31,170 --> 00:12:34,459
there was also the communications
decency act suppose up proposed by

246
00:12:34,459 --> 00:12:35,929
senator james exon

247
00:12:35,929 --> 00:12:39,410
if that would have I'm made it illegal
to show any

248
00:12:39,410 --> 00:12:43,449
up obscene content to a minor up through
the internet

249
00:12:43,449 --> 00:12:47,040
now a match in trying to enforce that
has severely crippling the Internet as

250
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:48,299
we know it and in fact

251
00:12:48,299 --> 00:12:52,069
I aside from the public outrage that it
provokes

252
00:12:52,069 --> 00:12:55,480
I it was declared unconstitutional the
very

253
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:59,339
hereafter was implemented based on our
free speech issues

254
00:12:59,339 --> 00:13:02,610
are but the question is that you know
the people who were from outside

255
00:13:02,610 --> 00:13:05,189
government who were involved they had
different levels a bit packed

256
00:13:05,189 --> 00:13:08,410
because some work you know people the
general public who were involved

257
00:13:08,410 --> 00:13:11,970
were pretty far back they were you
pretty sub some of them were very aware

258
00:13:11,970 --> 00:13:13,089
was going on

259
00:13:13,089 --> 00:13:16,350
some of them were very much less away
remember we didn't have the Internet to

260
00:13:16,350 --> 00:13:19,519
easily keep track of these things so
people had to do a lot more work to

261
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:22,079
figure out what the status on these
issues were into

262
00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:25,879
even organize any cuts a protest to
write a letter anything like that

263
00:13:25,879 --> 00:13:29,100
and then we had this council that was a
little closer to the end to the action

264
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:31,480
because they had this formal affiliation
with the

265
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:36,040
II TF but again they were sort of
one-member among many

266
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:39,600
I who were all together trying to find
the consensus of

267
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:42,569
where people from all these different
directions were coming from and that

268
00:13:42,569 --> 00:13:46,369
seems like it be a little straining

269
00:13:46,369 --> 00:13:49,980
so that was basically the policy that
was happening

270
00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:53,790
own before forget what actually happened
with all this I P controversy

271
00:13:53,790 --> 00:13:57,439
well there was a split this is be back
at four that actually took years a

272
00:13:57,439 --> 00:13:59,179
debate between the IP committee

273
00:13:59,179 --> 00:14:03,069
and the group academics and um

274
00:14:03,069 --> 00:14:06,239
said the groups and academics and
universities and

275
00:14:06,239 --> 00:14:09,600
other libraries and other folks who
found it objectionable but eventually

276
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:12,559
there was sort of stuck to the back
toward a little international treaty

277
00:14:12,559 --> 00:14:13,249
provisions

278
00:14:13,249 --> 00:14:17,149
and a lot of the usual politicking you
might expect and eventually we ended up

279
00:14:17,149 --> 00:14:19,119
with the Digital Millennium Copyright
Act

280
00:14:19,119 --> 00:14:23,559
which has cost no controversy since then

281
00:14:23,559 --> 00:14:27,160
so start now we can go to the Internet
Society and if you've been wondering

282
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:30,329
since the beginning exactly what that is
wait no longer

283
00:14:30,329 --> 00:14:34,660
was founded by Sir Frank on in 1992 with
the belief that the Internet is for

284
00:14:34,660 --> 00:14:35,730
everyone

285
00:14:35,730 --> 00:14:38,850
you know this is a again a pretty big
change from the research network up just

286
00:14:38,850 --> 00:14:40,420
the decade prior

287
00:14:40,420 --> 00:14:44,709
I am and they recognized that as this
network became more prominent they were

288
00:14:44,709 --> 00:14:45,149
gonna be

289
00:14:45,149 --> 00:14:49,850
issues that develops at very keep social
policy issues that developed

290
00:14:49,850 --> 00:14:53,709
that it was good that something like
this really need to be around to address

291
00:14:53,709 --> 00:14:57,309
its initial at its initial our focus was
to

292
00:14:57,309 --> 00:15:00,529
really sort of help the internets
technical development through something

293
00:15:00,529 --> 00:15:01,149
called the

294
00:15:01,149 --> 00:15:04,559
internet Engineering Task Force which
really focuses on sort of protocol in

295
00:15:04,559 --> 00:15:05,609
packet engineering

296
00:15:05,609 --> 00:15:09,629
but as it's developed as got this
outreach to leave cats got pillars from

297
00:15:09,629 --> 00:15:12,779
outreach technology and policy so today

298
00:15:12,779 --> 00:15:15,790
the Internet Society actually has
attended all sorts a

299
00:15:15,790 --> 00:15:19,799
internet related activities from you
know come in some policies like sober

300
00:15:19,799 --> 00:15:23,259
to sponsoring international internet
organizations like the Internet

301
00:15:23,259 --> 00:15:24,339
Governance Forum

302
00:15:24,339 --> 00:15:28,100
to even management at the dot org domain
system

303
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:31,350
so the Internet Society really
represents what are the first attempts

304
00:15:31,350 --> 00:15:35,389
with the first efforts to get more
people involved people who weren't

305
00:15:35,389 --> 00:15:39,239
interested who weren't already in policy
your government or had any reason

306
00:15:39,239 --> 00:15:42,480
already to know much about what's going
on with this thing

307
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:46,059
today it has about a hundred chapters
throughout the world including one

308
00:15:46,059 --> 00:15:51,559
right here in new york to address the
concerns with local members

309
00:15:51,559 --> 00:15:55,269
and another key organization that was
founded in the late 90's

310
00:15:55,269 --> 00:15:58,319
was the Internet Corporation for
Assigned Names and Numbers

311
00:15:58,319 --> 00:16:01,859
it was basically it's this is what is in
charge of managing the domain in systems

312
00:16:01,859 --> 00:16:04,339
IP allocations and protocol port numbers

313
00:16:04,339 --> 00:16:07,419
this was a job that used to be handled
by Jon Postel

314
00:16:07,419 --> 00:16:11,279
but unfortunately I'm he he left

315
00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:14,859
he he was he died in the mid 90's so why
they decided that

316
00:16:14,859 --> 00:16:19,359
he was such a powerhouse they didn't our
corporation to do his job

317
00:16:19,359 --> 00:16:23,379
since then up there have been some
long-standing concerns over

318
00:16:23,379 --> 00:16:26,980
ICANN's transparency and the fact that
was established by

319
00:16:26,980 --> 00:16:30,529
are you up by the US a chart Department
of Commerce as opposed to an

320
00:16:30,529 --> 00:16:32,259
international organization

321
00:16:32,259 --> 00:16:36,199
is what let this has led many people who
are up from outside the US involved in a

322
00:16:36,199 --> 00:16:36,829
governance

323
00:16:36,829 --> 00:16:39,869
to basically say that the US controls
the Internet which

324
00:16:39,869 --> 00:16:43,279
i think is %uh you know a little
reductionist but it did remain a

325
00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:47,230
the long-standing issue now for those
are you in the know you might be aware

326
00:16:47,230 --> 00:16:50,859
that I can has recently announced its
ending the contract with commerce

327
00:16:50,859 --> 00:16:54,410
and it tends to move into an
international body but

328
00:16:54,410 --> 00:16:58,629
exactly how that's going to happen is
yet where we're not really sure

329
00:16:58,629 --> 00:17:02,350
I band also if you've heard something
about the global top level domain

330
00:17:02,350 --> 00:17:06,880
thats ICANN's doing as well

331
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:10,839
and finally the salsa these
organizations like

332
00:17:10,839 --> 00:17:15,000
I can i suck really point to something
called the multi-stakeholder model

333
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:18,470
no when is that this is a change from

334
00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:21,610
for those of you who are not political
scientists I'll fill you in are the

335
00:17:21,610 --> 00:17:24,280
traditional means if diplomacy and
governance

336
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:29,720
and policy agreements are on a global
scale was done through multilateralism

337
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:33,260
this is a comprised of the staff was
states and diplomats

338
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:36,440
and transnational corporations were
talking with people on you know these

339
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:38,320
types of scales here

340
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:41,560
which seemed appropriate before we had
something like the Internet

341
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:45,450
it was difficult and had synthesize
information about what was going on in

342
00:17:45,450 --> 00:17:48,950
we as a people couldn't really
communicate are um

343
00:17:48,950 --> 00:17:52,290
our interests and our ideas so
effectively

344
00:17:52,290 --> 00:17:56,390
to people to the government so we kinda
need them to do a lot of this for us

345
00:17:56,390 --> 00:18:00,040
but as the internet came into being we
had this multi-stakeholder model

346
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:04,810
which seeks to bring every stakeholder
in that means if you or your user

347
00:18:04,810 --> 00:18:07,870
or otherwise involved with the Internet
every way

348
00:18:07,870 --> 00:18:12,230
you have a stake but exactly how we
gonna do that

349
00:18:12,230 --> 00:18:15,940
and to this day there isn't really a
clear definition

350
00:18:15,940 --> 00:18:20,220
up with the multi-stakeholder model
actually is or how it works this graphic

351
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:22,790
that I've got here is actually the CLO
the only

352
00:18:22,790 --> 00:18:27,400
version the closest thing I found to any
sort of definition a multi-stakeholder

353
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:28,090
model

354
00:18:28,090 --> 00:18:30,900
resort a clear definition but even then
that leaves a lot of room for

355
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:32,160
interpretation

356
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:35,500
and you can start to see how the history
has

357
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:38,530
lead to a very open questions Internet
Governance that have

358
00:18:38,530 --> 00:18:41,730
I am and that's why we see a lot of
debates today

359
00:18:41,730 --> 00:18:46,030
over issues like sober and snowed in
other issues in the Internet where a lot

360
00:18:46,030 --> 00:18:49,070
of things really have been settled or to
find all that much

361
00:18:49,070 --> 00:18:52,430
because they were defined back then
either but

362
00:18:52,430 --> 00:18:55,970
we do see how a lot of the discussions
damir some discussions that were

363
00:18:55,970 --> 00:18:56,700
happening

364
00:18:56,700 --> 00:19:00,200
years and years ago as well so the
Internet is a very

365
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:03,470
young medium still especially when it
comes to its time

366
00:19:03,470 --> 00:19:07,460
in phnom in the public forum and in
terms of the

367
00:19:07,460 --> 00:19:10,140
understanding how it's going to be
covered in use it's it's very much

368
00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:11,450
remains an open question

369
00:19:11,450 --> 00:19:15,250
it's not a utility that we can come to
expect like you'd electricity or running

370
00:19:15,250 --> 00:19:16,180
water

371
00:19:16,180 --> 00:19:19,710
and are many people do tend to think
that way

372
00:19:19,710 --> 00:19:23,130
but it is still something that is become
enormous

373
00:19:23,130 --> 00:19:26,850
inordinately central to a lot of what
people do a slot with people in this

374
00:19:26,850 --> 00:19:27,690
room deal

375
00:19:27,690 --> 00:19:32,340
and it would be a mistake to not be
aware of these key governance issues

376
00:19:32,340 --> 00:19:36,730
so and let day under stop here and I'll
let David Solomon up here take over

377
00:19:36,730 --> 00:19:40,770
and bring us into the future

378
00:19:40,770 --> 00:19:45,300
thank you

379
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:49,010
are you can so this is good okay

380
00:19:49,010 --> 00:19:52,950
right I okay so have to pick up the
thread there with the multi-stakeholder

381
00:19:52,950 --> 00:19:54,140
as object I

382
00:19:54,140 --> 00:19:57,980
the current debate %uh in terms of
things like I can a lot has to do with

383
00:19:57,980 --> 00:19:59,260
the degree to which

384
00:19:59,260 --> 00:20:02,640
on whether nation-states I'll

385
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:05,900
alone or large multinational
corporations and so

386
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:09,840
orders or a media companies and that
type of thing should have the primary

387
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:11,400
role in Internet Governance

388
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:16,000
whether NGOs civil society should have a
role and what that role should be

389
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,790
but this is kinda misleading because it
now that practically almost everyone

390
00:20:19,790 --> 00:20:20,950
uses the Internet

391
00:20:20,950 --> 00:20:24,070
everyone has a stake order so the real
thing you challenge

392
00:20:24,070 --> 00:20:27,660
I believe unwell working on them this
particularly with the right side in New

393
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:28,350
York

394
00:20:28,350 --> 00:20:32,080
is to educate more people about you're
not conference because a lot of people

395
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:35,420
are so politically active in other ways
in their local communities that even at

396
00:20:35,420 --> 00:20:39,100
the federal the national state or
national level involved with politics

397
00:20:39,100 --> 00:20:42,150
who don't understand anything about are

398
00:20:42,150 --> 00:20:45,400
or even know the route that they use the
internet that there is such a thing as

399
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:46,540
Internet Governance

400
00:20:46,540 --> 00:20:50,910
are so I'm gonna jump to the next to a
level here are

401
00:20:50,910 --> 00:20:55,050
we've got we've figured out who the real
stakeholders are and now lets a

402
00:20:55,050 --> 00:20:58,050
take go to another level and are

403
00:20:58,050 --> 00:21:02,120
the models the Internet Society is the
internet is for everyone

404
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:05,530
of the founder Vince serve also likes
has been involved with the

405
00:21:05,530 --> 00:21:09,410
different initials in terms of things
like the Internet of Things so he likes

406
00:21:09,410 --> 00:21:12,490
the internet is for everything armed so

407
00:21:12,490 --> 00:21:15,950
but right now we're going to take a
quick look here

408
00:21:15,950 --> 00:21:19,330
at arm though bigger question of are

409
00:21:19,330 --> 00:21:23,950
who is everybody and what is everything
and a where is the internet

410
00:21:23,950 --> 00:21:27,050
are nowhere is cyberspace going

411
00:21:27,050 --> 00:21:30,450
so are it conserves a basic you know

412
00:21:30,450 --> 00:21:34,800
users of the internet so the new users
are coming from developing countries

413
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:38,920
and typically there lamar mobile like a
smartphone or a tablet as their primary

414
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:40,740
amines have access

415
00:21:40,740 --> 00:21:43,810
are the ongoing problem with new

416
00:21:43,810 --> 00:21:47,340
adopt a your new users on the internet
tends to be that over time there'll

417
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:50,950
love typically less sophisticated at the
same time cheaper more powerful hardware

418
00:21:50,950 --> 00:21:52,400
becomes available

419
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:55,970
and in the case of arm mobile devices

420
00:21:55,970 --> 00:22:00,110
are are most people who I'm sure are
very pro open source said the open

421
00:22:00,110 --> 00:22:00,900
source model

422
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:04,400
bochco as you know things like tablets
and mobile phones

423
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:07,800
tend to be more locked down more
proprietary software it's harder to

424
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:10,130
install open source software on them

425
00:22:10,130 --> 00:22:13,670
and of course as we probably many people
who are where

426
00:22:13,670 --> 00:22:17,460
the open source model is a better
security model not a perfect one but it

427
00:22:17,460 --> 00:22:19,400
allows for better auditing overall

428
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:23,540
are security problems so we're kind of
moving in an area where we can expect

429
00:22:23,540 --> 00:22:27,500
more security issues are at the end user
level for with new

430
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:33,430
Newton a new internet users always also
see the same problem %uh in terms of the

431
00:22:33,430 --> 00:22:37,610
I O T is the snow the Internet of Things
a recent wired our colleges where the

432
00:22:37,610 --> 00:22:38,190
other day

433
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:41,550
cover have it the and it

434
00:22:41,550 --> 00:22:45,400
situation with a hotel rooms where they
had all wired

435
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:49,550
her were using a wired communication are
a communication protocol that was

436
00:22:49,550 --> 00:22:51,800
intended for wired communication so
which is

437
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:55,960
so security is pretty simple there are
but they adapt it was used for our

438
00:22:55,960 --> 00:23:00,390
are you know guess at the hotel hotels
to turn on the lights and the air

439
00:23:00,390 --> 00:23:00,980
conditioner

440
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:05,620
with a I'll like with iPad but they it
after that wired communication program

441
00:23:05,620 --> 00:23:07,130
for a call that no security

442
00:23:07,130 --> 00:23:10,930
put that on a wireless network because
it was just the easy thing to do

443
00:23:10,930 --> 00:23:15,010
as of course that matter if your car a
you know Alicia's hacker you could turn

444
00:23:15,010 --> 00:23:15,390
off

445
00:23:15,390 --> 00:23:18,730
somebody else's air conditioning on a
hot day and that type of thing so we may

446
00:23:18,730 --> 00:23:19,850
be seeing a more

447
00:23:19,850 --> 00:23:24,830
incident so that as a Porsche through
take things and same with

448
00:23:24,830 --> 00:23:28,310
early days at the well but there were
you no harm

449
00:23:28,310 --> 00:23:32,420
this the corporate mainframe was put
online sometimes there are four say

450
00:23:32,420 --> 00:23:36,660
are for comic you know e-commerce
without proper consideration security

451
00:23:36,660 --> 00:23:40,650
we may be seeing I'll lot incidents in
the world to the Internet of Things with

452
00:23:40,650 --> 00:23:41,190
devices

453
00:23:41,190 --> 00:23:45,730
you know and other devices sensors in
sight where there are security problems

454
00:23:45,730 --> 00:23:50,320
arm the we're looking at a point where
are the

455
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:54,080
Bihar Internet of Things earlier you
know why least wireless connected

456
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:55,840
devices like sensors and the like

457
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:59,700
are going to be the US are going to be
expanding massively because

458
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:03,400
all up a couple of trends here are you
probably most people have heard of

459
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:04,490
Moore's Law that

460
00:24:04,490 --> 00:24:09,460
I every 18 months a the new computer
chip it's got double the density in

461
00:24:09,460 --> 00:24:11,010
terms of transistors on it

462
00:24:11,010 --> 00:24:14,520
all there's also something called homies
law that

463
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:19,200
style is similar for actual are energy
efficiency in

464
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:23,140
electronic so that is to say that's are
you know the actual

465
00:24:23,140 --> 00:24:26,390
arm power that's needed to out to do

466
00:24:26,390 --> 00:24:29,420
operator a certain type of computer with
us from the passage he is dropping

467
00:24:29,420 --> 00:24:30,450
massively

468
00:24:30,450 --> 00:24:34,320
and what that means is that are there is
an interesting Charlie Stross

469
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:38,810
futurist and sci-fi author I'll hatteras
the other interesting blog post where he

470
00:24:38,810 --> 00:24:39,920
speculates that

471
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:44,150
of bike you too 2030 that a city would
be able to

472
00:24:44,150 --> 00:24:49,330
corral be square meter of the the city
with sensors or embedded devices

473
00:24:49,330 --> 00:24:52,350
all that would be for quite powerful for
the caught the

474
00:24:52,350 --> 00:24:55,630
cost have curly with work awesome to
clean the streets

475
00:24:55,630 --> 00:24:59,530
so that you're naturally this nurses
lotta data and

476
00:24:59,530 --> 00:25:03,270
oldest major kinds of privacy issues
they are are at the same time

477
00:25:03,270 --> 00:25:06,560
thought you know the cuts two ways lot
if

478
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:10,190
you know general-purpose computers
become tidy and ubiquitous

479
00:25:10,190 --> 00:25:14,880
we can also have cool things like this
which are okay the sicko here

480
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:18,140
haha okay right okay arts groups while

481
00:25:18,140 --> 00:25:21,240
okay sorry folks haha okay you'll

482
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:24,260
yep that's right okay can we patient
care

483
00:25:24,260 --> 00:25:28,710
okay so this is a Raspberry Pi that's
been dogged set up specifically be used

484
00:25:28,710 --> 00:25:29,920
at the door outer

485
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:33,980
I'll is pretty inexpensive assists for
the a different website and thought so

486
00:25:33,980 --> 00:25:39,070
like a hundred hundred dollars are so
you can imagine that in a few years

487
00:25:39,070 --> 00:25:43,190
that they would be possible to take to
make lots of these are it incredibly

488
00:25:43,190 --> 00:25:45,570
tiny incredibly cheap and distribute
them

489
00:25:45,570 --> 00:25:49,540
all throughout San urban area so I want
to I one here to help

490
00:25:49,540 --> 00:25:53,520
problems with surveillance that becomes
ubiquitous but the same time you count

491
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:54,650
the ability to

492
00:25:54,650 --> 00:25:58,320
Aug right around damage and to
censorship and the like in a way that

493
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:01,250
has never been possible before

494
00:26:01,250 --> 00:26:04,760
okay news right at the Ricoh

495
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:08,420
factor okay it's all right okay so right
now

496
00:26:08,420 --> 00:26:12,660
well what else are hours for the
internet change well convince surf

497
00:26:12,660 --> 00:26:17,310
are it hit one another what pet project
of his is the interplanetary internet

498
00:26:17,310 --> 00:26:22,560
and on that actually is are not an
attempt to communicate with space aliens

499
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:23,160
will

500
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:26,390
maybe get to that later but up it's
basically

501
00:26:26,390 --> 00:26:31,110
a away to a doubt the Internet Protocol
for all the long distances

502
00:26:31,110 --> 00:26:35,330
an eruption solve art space travel but
he also has other kinds of interesting

503
00:26:35,330 --> 00:26:37,370
applications because it's basically

504
00:26:37,370 --> 00:26:42,680
delay tolerant networking where are your
options and and problems with that type

505
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:45,830
I can be worked around the way the
current Internet Protocol could cannot

506
00:26:45,830 --> 00:26:46,180
be

507
00:26:46,180 --> 00:26:50,080
so Aug it can also be used in a
situation where there's like some kind

508
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:50,860
of major and

509
00:26:50,860 --> 00:26:54,130
a their natural disaster breakdown I
love

510
00:26:54,130 --> 00:26:58,410
telecommunications infrastructure the
interplanetary Internet Protocol could

511
00:26:58,410 --> 00:27:02,710
a handle that better occurred you know
it could also be used in some cases were

512
00:27:02,710 --> 00:27:04,670
oppressive government interrupted

513
00:27:04,670 --> 00:27:08,820
telecommunication services and another
third application that's being looked at

514
00:27:08,820 --> 00:27:09,620
a lot

515
00:27:09,620 --> 00:27:12,930
is the use of scientific and
environmental research and varied

516
00:27:12,930 --> 00:27:16,140
I'm very remote places where there isn't
normal the

517
00:27:16,140 --> 00:27:19,470
infrastructure as well so for studying
wildlife are

518
00:27:19,470 --> 00:27:22,690
migration and I just an area you could
you something you could use the

519
00:27:22,690 --> 00:27:23,620
interplanetary

520
00:27:23,620 --> 00:27:27,090
Internet Protocol to more effectively
you don't put sensors

521
00:27:27,090 --> 00:27:31,860
in in that place and and collect the
community the data from them

522
00:27:31,860 --> 00:27:35,520
another a cool thing that's been surfing
musician Peter gray

523
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:38,750
Gabriel started are is the inter-species
internet

524
00:27:38,750 --> 00:27:43,450
are so again are definition of a
multi-stakeholder as expanding quite a

525
00:27:43,450 --> 00:27:47,380
bit the other species Internet is an
attempt to communicate with intelligent

526
00:27:47,380 --> 00:27:48,140
are

527
00:27:48,140 --> 00:27:51,960
grower creatures that are not human like
dolphins and such are using

528
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:56,900
are different kinds of the RR no digital
interfaces to teaching them to

529
00:27:56,900 --> 00:28:00,809
for example to you know having a really
waterproof course but

530
00:28:00,809 --> 00:28:04,080
a large tablet computer which a dolphin
might learn to

531
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:07,440
you know bob with a different the
sections of the scree the touch screen

532
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:08,570
with his nose and

533
00:28:08,570 --> 00:28:12,910
and learn to communicate that way so
obviously dow the road we may be looking

534
00:28:12,910 --> 00:28:13,570
at

535
00:28:13,570 --> 00:28:17,290
are some very different kinds of
stakeholders in the Internet

536
00:28:17,290 --> 00:28:21,490
another more bizarre and a slightly
disturbing right trend is the used

537
00:28:21,490 --> 00:28:25,400
love are military applications for
animals that are involved

538
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:29,140
on no different kinds of implants and
and the like

539
00:28:29,140 --> 00:28:33,140
a one particularly bizarre one is door
prize hi memes

540
00:28:33,140 --> 00:28:36,530
that's an acronym project which sense
for hybrid insect

541
00:28:36,530 --> 00:28:41,520
micro electrical mechanical systems and
what they were doing there are I had a

542
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:45,880
have are as a lot 2011 I couldn't find
anything we're up to date on this but it

543
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:47,670
was a long term project robot

544
00:28:47,670 --> 00:28:51,559
six or seven years they were betting
electronic devices into

545
00:28:51,559 --> 00:28:54,740
insect larva rape so that as the insect
I came

546
00:28:54,740 --> 00:28:58,870
you know to be an adult is like to know
%uh that they would be actually be able

547
00:28:58,870 --> 00:29:00,790
to control the insects movements

548
00:29:00,790 --> 00:29:04,040
with the idea of make basically it's
bizarre as it may sound making

549
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:08,090
cyborg insert warriors the ideas
initially that they would fly around in

550
00:29:08,090 --> 00:29:10,100
the could do reconnaissance but I
suppose

551
00:29:10,100 --> 00:29:13,180
if you got a really good old venomous in
such with

552
00:29:13,180 --> 00:29:16,660
you know you could use it as an assassin
till but again

553
00:29:16,660 --> 00:29:20,700
the point is here that Aug you know
basically anything electronic now is

554
00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:24,660
likely to be connected in often
wirelessly to the internet so we know

555
00:29:24,660 --> 00:29:28,300
well the are the cyborg insect warriors
are also

556
00:29:28,300 --> 00:29:32,480
stakeholders in the internet potentially
arm to move

557
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:35,540
a the two now we're gonna go the

558
00:29:35,540 --> 00:29:38,970
reverse direction here so now we're
talking about who's coming online now

559
00:29:38,970 --> 00:29:41,059
we're going to talk I'm gonna move
through

560
00:29:41,059 --> 00:29:44,170
are dropping a little bit further into
cyberspace

561
00:29:44,170 --> 00:29:47,210
with virtual worlds and augmented
reality

562
00:29:47,210 --> 00:29:50,290
and of virtual worlds are taking off are

563
00:29:50,290 --> 00:29:54,700
at a rapid pace pace now there are
things like I like merserve online games

564
00:29:54,700 --> 00:29:55,580
and the like

565
00:29:55,580 --> 00:29:58,680
are in you may think if you're not a guy
gamer or

566
00:29:58,680 --> 00:30:02,090
you know into such things that it still
seems that the inner

567
00:30:02,090 --> 00:30:05,530
the resolution and the actual quality of
health the environment

568
00:30:05,530 --> 00:30:10,100
experience is very poor are the other
you can imagine people really living

569
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:15,180
in cyberspace quite yet but the brain is
hard-wired to respond to two things

570
00:30:15,180 --> 00:30:18,600
are without questioning whether their
very much whether they are real or not

571
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:19,930
and one is

572
00:30:19,930 --> 00:30:24,320
are threatening you know stimuli social
threatened you don't worry

573
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:27,350
go too much or question too much for
some things real because you don't want

574
00:30:27,350 --> 00:30:28,500
to hurt you

575
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:32,160
conversely something pleasurable why why
why worry if it's pleasurable

576
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:35,200
whether it's real or not either so for
example really sophisticated

577
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:36,970
well-designed game might

578
00:30:36,970 --> 00:30:40,670
switch like in a rapidly between
threatening a pleasure leap was

579
00:30:40,670 --> 00:30:44,010
pleasurable stimuli to the degree that
it becomes very important even if

580
00:30:44,010 --> 00:30:48,160
again the resolution of say an online
game the the imagery is not really

581
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:51,900
are ultra-high resolution a realistic
you can become very very absorbed in

582
00:30:51,900 --> 00:30:52,230
that

583
00:30:52,230 --> 00:30:56,000
arm and know we're all at the same time
we're moving

584
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:59,330
%uh towards are the increasing use of

585
00:30:59,330 --> 00:31:02,960
Hurley for medical and military
applications

586
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:06,480
things like a implant in class for
people who are hard of hearing

587
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:10,929
their network connected bionic eyes for
or imply its the optic nerves for people

588
00:31:10,929 --> 00:31:11,690
with work

589
00:31:11,690 --> 00:31:15,290
blind or have a visual problems but
obviously those types of things could be

590
00:31:15,290 --> 00:31:15,980
used

591
00:31:15,980 --> 00:31:20,150
just as a general-purpose a.m. in you
know replacement for

592
00:31:20,150 --> 00:31:23,240
are the court monitors that we have so

593
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:27,380
are basically world we're looking at a
situation where that sense of self will

594
00:31:27,380 --> 00:31:28,860
be changing rapidly

595
00:31:28,860 --> 00:31:32,650
if your help you help the stimuli thats
coming from cyberspace or somewhere else

596
00:31:32,650 --> 00:31:33,850
feeding into your

597
00:31:33,850 --> 00:31:38,190
directly into your brain Aug your sense
of what your body is and you're such a

598
00:31:38,190 --> 00:31:40,800
self that we will change very rapidly

599
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:44,830
Aug and also it where we're seeing is a
shifting census

600
00:31:44,830 --> 00:31:48,970
uS cellphone loyalty institutions that
changing partly because

601
00:31:48,970 --> 00:31:52,080
of you know things like are younger
people feeling

602
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:56,010
alienated arm having economic
difficulties and so forth one study

603
00:31:56,010 --> 00:31:56,679
found that

604
00:31:56,679 --> 00:31:59,870
people's arm life satisfaction with
their lives

605
00:31:59,870 --> 00:32:04,000
are im know the real world was kinda in
first two thereof

606
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:08,080
the satisfaction in there are say that
they do you no good to all things in

607
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:09,390
Second Life or what have you

608
00:32:09,390 --> 00:32:13,330
their second life existence if that was
very positive for their rehab years

609
00:32:13,330 --> 00:32:14,929
probably cancer like right real

610
00:32:14,929 --> 00:32:19,200
their physical life and physical world
and the space was not as good

611
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:22,410
so are worsening II with people who are
because

612
00:32:22,410 --> 00:32:27,260
your people who are their own though
being duty economic disparity and other

613
00:32:27,260 --> 00:32:28,280
kinds of issues

614
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:32,050
alienated from a political and economic
systems in the real world moving

615
00:32:32,050 --> 00:32:36,160
Lapid Lee to spending more and more time
in virtual worlds

616
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:39,610
are the other interesting thing there is
that are

617
00:32:39,610 --> 00:32:42,780
there's a fairly recent study but are a
couple years ago that

618
00:32:42,780 --> 00:32:46,750
are at that point are the user users are

619
00:32:46,750 --> 00:32:51,640
love online games and and in our virtual
worlds to be had for Avatar sore for and

620
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:52,160
I'll

621
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:55,900
I each stakeholder is now been
multiplied by four we have for

622
00:32:55,900 --> 00:32:59,110
that people for help on my part
personalities for every

623
00:32:59,110 --> 00:33:02,790
every person so things are changing that
way

624
00:33:02,790 --> 00:33:07,809
arm and these are the are growing
presence of people are there the

625
00:33:07,809 --> 00:33:11,270
were the people interviewed for world
are and

626
00:33:11,270 --> 00:33:14,679
are online games in the that virtual
environment has it all

627
00:33:14,679 --> 00:33:18,370
presents a lot of interesting challenges
to the traditional nation-states

628
00:33:18,370 --> 00:33:23,809
so arm the you know basically the
concert tour

629
00:33:23,809 --> 00:33:27,750
I'm citing mark Goodman who is they are
law enforcement consultant who

630
00:33:27,750 --> 00:33:29,820
specializes in cybercrime

631
00:33:29,820 --> 00:33:34,290
cyberterrorism information warfare are
and he talks about how

632
00:33:34,290 --> 00:33:37,990
the controversial reality is pretty new
to law enforcement agencies around the

633
00:33:37,990 --> 00:33:38,820
world yet

634
00:33:38,820 --> 00:33:42,420
are more more people are spending more
for their time in the virtual world

635
00:33:42,420 --> 00:33:45,590
and the four major criminal activities
that we see the real world

636
00:33:45,590 --> 00:33:49,380
is rapidly migrating to are to
cyberspace

637
00:33:49,380 --> 00:33:53,150
a in terms of specific in terms of work
for world's

638
00:33:53,150 --> 00:33:57,350
where things like money laundering and
theft of intellectual property

639
00:33:57,350 --> 00:34:00,490
stranger child abuse images and %uh the
like

640
00:34:00,490 --> 00:34:04,140
are occurring without power you know the
same kind of awareness and terms law

641
00:34:04,140 --> 00:34:05,350
enforcement

642
00:34:05,350 --> 00:34:08,829
Carly for our most were virtual worlds
are

643
00:34:08,829 --> 00:34:12,069
are kinda siloed the environment circa

644
00:34:12,069 --> 00:34:17,029
Flickr a couple like Second Life use as
proprietary software a centralized kind

645
00:34:17,029 --> 00:34:18,190
of architecture

646
00:34:18,190 --> 00:34:21,739
but that's changing true a person you've
never hurt you

647
00:34:21,739 --> 00:34:24,819
up everyone here is her doctor tim
berners-lee him know that he and other

648
00:34:24,819 --> 00:34:25,960
world-wide-web

649
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:30,849
another person who is probably I think
in a few years will be seen as as

650
00:34:30,849 --> 00:34:32,419
important as as Tim

651
00:34:32,419 --> 00:34:35,609
I and her name is Christina vedere
lopazz

652
00:34:35,609 --> 00:34:39,559
archer computer science is based are the
University of California

653
00:34:39,559 --> 00:34:43,179
and 2009 she developed the hyper great
and that's an open-source

654
00:34:43,179 --> 00:34:46,440
so technology for by doing what

655
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:50,599
in virtual worlds with the web dollars
for the internet so there is

656
00:34:50,599 --> 00:34:55,690
makes interoperable virtual worlds so
you can go from one your avatar to go

657
00:34:55,690 --> 00:34:57,319
from one world to another

658
00:34:57,319 --> 00:35:00,450
and this opens things up radically but
also presents interesting

659
00:35:00,450 --> 00:35:04,789
problems in terms of our intellectual
property and

660
00:35:04,789 --> 00:35:08,309
that type of thing what can you take for
OneWorld to the next

661
00:35:08,309 --> 00:35:11,660
some kinds of issues much more complex
but so were the ones that have been

662
00:35:11,660 --> 00:35:15,019
have mostly been dealt with in the web a
long time ago

663
00:35:15,019 --> 00:35:18,779
are into her up in addition there is now
a open better verse

664
00:35:18,779 --> 00:35:23,380
currency that allows transactions across
both these different virtual worlds

665
00:35:23,380 --> 00:35:27,499
and they can be converted to regular
occurrences bitcoins them

666
00:35:27,499 --> 00:35:30,720
.us dollars and that type of thing so a

667
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:34,589
I was talking a worker a moment ago
about the change ur fav

668
00:35:34,589 --> 00:35:38,289
sense of self and identity are that
people experience

669
00:35:38,289 --> 00:35:42,309
there are or it through think alike it
was up to I'm

670
00:35:42,309 --> 00:35:46,119
technologies a virtual worlds and also
implants arm

671
00:35:46,119 --> 00:35:49,239
and these present a lot of interesting

672
00:35:49,239 --> 00:35:53,480
questions here too darpa is currently
working on mood altering implants to

673
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:55,599
help people with the poster a stress

674
00:35:55,599 --> 00:36:00,529
dramatic you know PST the are so they're
looking to appeal to alter people's

675
00:36:00,529 --> 00:36:04,730
boots with brain implants which of
course will be connected to

676
00:36:04,730 --> 00:36:09,029
wirelessly most likely as increasingly
medical prostheses are

677
00:36:09,029 --> 00:36:12,470
arm and a who else is going to be on the
internet well

678
00:36:12,470 --> 00:36:16,619
you think you're so we were determined
that people or becoming several people

679
00:36:16,619 --> 00:36:19,190
in terms of different personalities on
the the

680
00:36:19,190 --> 00:36:23,489
in cyberspace with their different
avatars but so it gets a little stranger

681
00:36:23,489 --> 00:36:24,150
here

682
00:36:24,150 --> 00:36:27,660
are daughter also is working on a

683
00:36:27,660 --> 00:36:31,059
type us sensors that will all recognize

684
00:36:31,059 --> 00:36:34,089
a on Khao Lak your basically when you're

685
00:36:34,089 --> 00:36:38,269
experts are life-threatening situation
you sense it unconsciously more quickly

686
00:36:38,269 --> 00:36:40,029
than you respond consciously

687
00:36:40,029 --> 00:36:43,749
so to speed things up in the battlefield
they're looking to develop

688
00:36:43,749 --> 00:36:47,859
are different kinds of monitors that
will fire recognize the unconscious

689
00:36:47,859 --> 00:36:49,880
reaction to a perceived threat

690
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:54,529
and allow a soldier to or help help help
a soldier by helping his

691
00:36:54,529 --> 00:36:58,349
are the electronic cause gunsight as a
weapon

692
00:36:58,349 --> 00:37:01,609
start to look for the target before he's
even know where are the

693
00:37:01,609 --> 00:37:06,279
his he or she has to identify the threat

694
00:37:06,279 --> 00:37:09,480
so basically the unconscious mind is
going to have its own lol

695
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:13,119
you know input on the Internet separate
and this while could be

696
00:37:13,119 --> 00:37:16,390
obviously developed a dollar kind about
occasions in a different sort of

697
00:37:16,390 --> 00:37:19,430
thing where you can I'm the maybe deny
that you

698
00:37:19,430 --> 00:37:23,220
did something because my unconscious
didn't but wasn't me

699
00:37:23,220 --> 00:37:28,369
in any event arm obviously these kinds
of

700
00:37:28,369 --> 00:37:32,029
are more in invasive types of interfaces

701
00:37:32,029 --> 00:37:35,130
a present major kinds of security issues
that haven't been

702
00:37:35,130 --> 00:37:38,509
I can all the technology is running
ahead of

703
00:37:38,509 --> 00:37:41,670
nowhere uses security is being guitar so
and its

704
00:37:41,670 --> 00:37:45,710
by key battery you know breaks into your
bank account in steals money but if they

705
00:37:45,710 --> 00:37:46,190
start

706
00:37:46,190 --> 00:37:49,989
you to control your arms legs and your
oppressions at the world that that's all

707
00:37:49,989 --> 00:37:51,289
skill your

708
00:37:51,289 --> 00:37:54,619
are and so there is a reaction to all
this

709
00:37:54,619 --> 00:37:59,470
so that and of course more mundane kinds
of security issues we see you

710
00:37:59,470 --> 00:38:03,980
been all are all over very aware
recently like this northern revelations

711
00:38:03,980 --> 00:38:08,099
and I'll been a reaction to it so that
both the crumbling and the German

712
00:38:08,099 --> 00:38:09,049
government for example

713
00:38:09,049 --> 00:38:12,299
are reverting to paper manual
typewriters are

714
00:38:12,299 --> 00:38:16,190
for critical secure high-security arm
communications error in their

715
00:38:16,190 --> 00:38:17,539
organizations

716
00:38:17,539 --> 00:38:20,940
are in over favorite sci-fi of a
visionary

717
00:38:20,940 --> 00:38:25,170
sci-fi author of my fill up to a Corolla
dollar la novela many years ago called

718
00:38:25,170 --> 00:38:25,999
you back

719
00:38:25,999 --> 00:38:30,009
which describe a up are the story
involves a prudence organization which

720
00:38:30,009 --> 00:38:31,130
employ people

721
00:38:31,130 --> 00:38:35,749
are with a serve inverted kind of
psychic abilities not

722
00:38:35,749 --> 00:38:39,140
that they weren't psychic what they're
able to block other people psychic

723
00:38:39,140 --> 00:38:40,470
abilities because

724
00:38:40,470 --> 00:38:44,319
a telepathy was being used in industrial
output espionage so sure

725
00:38:44,319 --> 00:38:48,039
your had a company that we're concerned
about another company might spy on you

726
00:38:48,039 --> 00:38:48,690
you'd hire

727
00:38:48,690 --> 00:38:51,920
a anti telepath to accompany you

728
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:55,910
when you're went to a conference in your
gonna discuss some sensitive stuff

729
00:38:55,910 --> 00:38:59,239
so artwork this always kinda Graham and

730
00:38:59,239 --> 00:39:02,440
the scariest of are and arm

731
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:06,249
basically we need there'll a comes back
I think in the end

732
00:39:06,249 --> 00:39:09,630
to Aug the fact that it's are

733
00:39:09,630 --> 00:39:12,690
in the end human beings developed
technology even if we make the the

734
00:39:12,690 --> 00:39:13,910
technology then came

735
00:39:13,910 --> 00:39:17,670
you know or propagate itself and
ultimately

736
00:39:17,670 --> 00:39:21,160
know what has to be built into the
technology is

737
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:24,579
unethical sense it is a machines become
more intelligent

738
00:39:24,579 --> 00:39:28,739
we need to do that even more so up in
Logan who is a friend of the Internet

739
00:39:28,739 --> 00:39:29,749
Society of New York

740
00:39:29,749 --> 00:39:32,829
IIIA both soil important the

741
00:39:32,829 --> 00:39:36,700
software freedom advocate and had dubbed
a lot of legal work for the Free

742
00:39:36,700 --> 00:39:39,170
Software Foundation as well as teaching
at columbia

743
00:39:39,170 --> 00:39:42,319
award specifically about at mobile
devices

744
00:39:42,319 --> 00:39:46,249
that knew too much in who's in inner
workings were not understood

745
00:39:46,249 --> 00:39:50,239
all right he are season just that there
be a basically

746
00:39:50,239 --> 00:39:55,400
Aug that the ethics still has a copy
haver be programmed hard-wired into

747
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:58,670
I intelligent machines and he was kinda
thinking a little bit I love

748
00:39:58,670 --> 00:40:02,339
are you know I think as malls iRobot of
course are

749
00:40:02,339 --> 00:40:06,099
there's now a really pretty cool the
organization called the

750
00:40:06,099 --> 00:40:10,769
open-label ethics initiative all which
is a think tank that's addressing issues

751
00:40:10,769 --> 00:40:12,180
so far

752
00:40:12,180 --> 00:40:15,809
well you know are ethics as I think
pertain to robotics

753
00:40:15,809 --> 00:40:19,579
and taking try to take an open source
approach to it are looking to the drama

754
00:40:19,579 --> 00:40:20,119
models

755
00:40:20,119 --> 00:40:23,779
over a Wikipedia 1x2 are the final

756
00:40:23,779 --> 00:40:28,589
arm question here i guess it just gets
back to is reserved for our

757
00:40:28,589 --> 00:40:32,170
no a little bit of Internet Governance
but the real question is whether human

758
00:40:32,170 --> 00:40:33,700
communicate get to the

759
00:40:33,700 --> 00:40:36,910
internet injuring task force credo of

760
00:40:36,910 --> 00:40:41,450
are Rothko 10 consensus are whether

761
00:40:41,450 --> 00:40:45,880
Rajaratnam right right rough consensus
and running coli I do it was something

762
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:46,529
like that

763
00:40:46,529 --> 00:40:50,019
ought to whether the before the machines
are can go on

764
00:40:50,019 --> 00:40:55,299
go to there are you know act out the
worst impulses are human beings and Adam

765
00:40:55,299 --> 00:40:59,819
ultimately onto their own Oh No unknown
agenda before we can stop it

766
00:40:59,819 --> 00:41:03,190
so thank you

767
00:41:03,190 --> 00:41:08,229
thank you very much

768
00:41:08,229 --> 00:41:13,710
but you are planning to hear about cyber
insect were yesterday

769
00:41:13,710 --> 00:41:16,989
alright so um I think will start to take
questions now

770
00:41:16,989 --> 00:41:20,319
Ramona Turner the house lights second
their ego

771
00:41:20,319 --> 00:41:24,819
thanks they all are alright so if anyone
has any questions so we'd be happy to

772
00:41:24,819 --> 00:41:26,069
feel them

773
00:41:26,069 --> 00:41:32,589
oh yes it happens

774
00:41:32,589 --> 00:41:36,369
I'm it on questions light indicates
questions I'm

775
00:41:36,369 --> 00:41:39,950
I heard question more about the this our
mechanics earth

776
00:41:39,950 --> 00:41:42,989
the unit society and i cant such as a
curtain exist

777
00:41:42,989 --> 00:41:46,400
um he'd mention nine-time from there
with the I can I tried

778
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:50,289
distance itself from being a US

779
00:41:50,289 --> 00:41:55,329
what's the a run by the Commerce
Department comes apartment

780
00:41:55,329 --> 00:41:59,089
is if any discussion like moving
underneath the unit society or

781
00:41:59,089 --> 00:42:02,369
having own thing its own thing her arm

782
00:42:02,369 --> 00:42:05,630
the Internet Society is taking more of a
role in I can

783
00:42:05,630 --> 00:42:10,650
our recently so that we will we have for
people who are on the

784
00:42:10,650 --> 00:42:14,450
different because the committees and
oversight organizations for I can also

785
00:42:14,450 --> 00:42:17,630
%uh this is a a good thing in this is
why you should join the internet site

786
00:42:17,630 --> 00:42:19,420
and get involved with the local chapter

787
00:42:19,420 --> 00:42:22,950
ought the yeahh the sales pitch

788
00:42:22,950 --> 00:42:26,039
are there are like caucuses

789
00:42:26,039 --> 00:42:29,589
we think alike and they're called a
large structures Jens are

790
00:42:29,589 --> 00:42:32,859
the past few internet society chapters

791
00:42:32,859 --> 00:42:36,150
were at large structures including ours
that your point

792
00:42:36,150 --> 00:42:39,269
but that's changed radically so that now
about fifty percent

793
00:42:39,269 --> 00:42:44,430
all the at large structures are all
actually in rats aside each after so

794
00:42:44,430 --> 00:42:47,539
the Internet Society is take a more
active role

795
00:42:47,539 --> 00:42:50,759
you're not going to take over control I
can bite

796
00:42:50,759 --> 00:42:53,930
I have a are a growing role in and terms
and advocacy

797
00:42:53,930 --> 00:42:57,460
and our really work no very much working
pushing for

798
00:42:57,460 --> 00:43:02,390
greater accountability transparency
thank you

799
00:43:02,390 --> 00:43:05,950
higher dominance Kevin Caron from
Atlanta Georgia and full disclosure I'm

800
00:43:05,950 --> 00:43:08,239
more of a political activist than I am a

801
00:43:08,239 --> 00:43:13,529
tech person so a bear with me but on one
other issues that I work on in atlanta

802
00:43:13,529 --> 00:43:16,609
is the issue of autonomous weapons
that's coming up

803
00:43:16,609 --> 00:43:20,529
are more recently on there's gonna be
some more work done this the

804
00:43:20,529 --> 00:43:23,640
international community coming up here
and I talked to mark a brood

805
00:43:23,640 --> 00:43:27,710
desert a scientist he suggested a ban on
Thomas weapons in 1988

806
00:43:27,710 --> 00:43:31,170
I'm curiously where you see this going
in in kind of what needs to be done

807
00:43:31,170 --> 00:43:32,059
there's a researcher

808
00:43:32,059 --> 00:43:35,089
in atlanta who's working on it right now
and

809
00:43:35,089 --> 00:43:39,920
DOD wants him to do it so I'm security
your thoughts on that

810
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:43,779
well the allelic David like this all
just start by saying that I think a

811
00:43:43,779 --> 00:43:47,759
total outright ban a total outward
supportive anything is a is an

812
00:43:47,759 --> 00:43:49,309
oversimplification

813
00:43:49,309 --> 00:43:53,489
I mean because as with any software or
technological item an autonomous weapon

814
00:43:53,489 --> 00:43:54,239
system

815
00:43:54,239 --> 00:43:57,950
is made with different parts I mean
really it's the weapon parts that stuff

816
00:43:57,950 --> 00:43:59,059
that's dangerous

817
00:43:59,059 --> 00:44:01,710
the autonomous part maybe not so you
take away the rocket there's not really

818
00:44:01,710 --> 00:44:02,920
much of a threat

819
00:44:02,920 --> 00:44:06,079
so I think that you know so the question
is

820
00:44:06,079 --> 00:44:10,069
would we ban this technology may be
banned you know the user the rocket

821
00:44:10,069 --> 00:44:13,239
or I think I think that in order to
answer that question fully we have to

822
00:44:13,239 --> 00:44:14,170
break it down

823
00:44:14,170 --> 00:44:18,979
start sure sure a there was a DOD
directive that kinda defines what the US

824
00:44:18,979 --> 00:44:19,369
is

825
00:44:19,369 --> 00:44:23,069
is calling autonomous weapons so that's
gonna wear my head that but

826
00:44:23,069 --> 00:44:26,729
wat r occurrence weapons now in place
and some positive parts in the world

827
00:44:26,729 --> 00:44:27,339
like a

828
00:44:27,339 --> 00:44:30,450
the DMZ in korea lookout

829
00:44:30,450 --> 00:44:34,220
boron both sides have autonomous weapons
there are other fixed

830
00:44:34,220 --> 00:44:38,069
you know basically guns with a computer
about that will

831
00:44:38,069 --> 00:44:41,940
identify torrent you that are a while
ago as I they

832
00:44:41,940 --> 00:44:45,339
the Google drones an aerial aerial
robotics

833
00:44:45,339 --> 00:44:48,440
conference which was likely down on them
that the

834
00:44:48,440 --> 00:44:53,700
York Law School on Daniel Suarez who was
a a a sci-fi author with a military

835
00:44:53,700 --> 00:44:54,339
background

836
00:44:54,339 --> 00:44:57,809
okay work with fantastic talking just
what a novel about the subject

837
00:44:57,809 --> 00:45:01,769
are specifically about arm that both a
Thomas weapons

838
00:45:01,769 --> 00:45:05,359
and our talents weapons that could car

839
00:45:05,359 --> 00:45:08,650
home for join your

840
00:45:08,650 --> 00:45:12,229
swarms are acting group independently
dunno

841
00:45:12,229 --> 00:45:15,229
ad hoc kinda basis are and what he
thought

842
00:45:15,229 --> 00:45:18,769
suggested is that all drones have a
cryptographic says

843
00:45:18,769 --> 00:45:21,869
the signature hard-wired into the you
know the main

844
00:45:21,869 --> 00:45:25,700
so the circuit board of other device on
them quite would always

845
00:45:25,700 --> 00:45:29,910
identify themselves you know that any
kind of drone that did not have this

846
00:45:29,910 --> 00:45:32,890
could be will be really be assumed to be
hostile and

847
00:45:32,890 --> 00:45:36,349
destroyed on so that that would
basically be the

848
00:45:36,349 --> 00:45:40,079
through this digital fingerprint would
be possible to identify them

849
00:45:40,079 --> 00:45:43,109
so that was his old you know technical
solution to it

850
00:45:43,109 --> 00:45:46,559
thanks great talk show thanks

851
00:45:46,559 --> 00:45:50,259
yes having a great talk thanks very much
and David you mentioned

852
00:45:50,259 --> 00:45:54,630
you talk briefly about ambien
conductivity about France's idea and

853
00:45:54,630 --> 00:45:58,519
for myself i think thats thats really
essential for an old been pervasive

854
00:45:58,519 --> 00:46:00,979
Internet of Things in the committee of
future

855
00:46:00,979 --> 00:46:05,450
and the previous talks we talked a lot
about ISP's Comcast being everywhere in

856
00:46:05,450 --> 00:46:06,039
all this

857
00:46:06,039 --> 00:46:09,289
incentive to to block something like I'm
in Kentucky

858
00:46:09,289 --> 00:46:12,420
I'd be curious how you see it possibly
playing out the challenges and

859
00:46:12,420 --> 00:46:15,809
like I think it's a real cool idea I'm
not quite sure how

860
00:46:15,809 --> 00:46:19,880
third exactly would be implemented that
to pick it up and just to clarify

861
00:46:19,880 --> 00:46:24,009
whatever your computer collectively by
Frank said that the original %uh

862
00:46:24,009 --> 00:46:27,900
spreadsheet was a Kalkan but now he's
there smart guys wanna

863
00:46:27,900 --> 00:46:30,900
to other things and is pushing this idea
a bit come

864
00:46:30,900 --> 00:46:34,450
connectivity the basically are the same
way that we don't you know

865
00:46:34,450 --> 00:46:37,989
take your streets and sidewalks words
for for granted that

866
00:46:37,989 --> 00:46:42,269
are connectivity to the Internet should
be successful is that it has ideas that

867
00:46:42,269 --> 00:46:45,999
are glad they're breaking down the silos
between different kinds of services so

868
00:46:45,999 --> 00:46:47,239
that for example

869
00:46:47,239 --> 00:46:51,319
are you might walk down miss the street
here and you know if you were to take

870
00:46:51,319 --> 00:46:53,460
out your smartphone you would see that

871
00:46:53,460 --> 00:46:57,809
there many many different wifi your hot
spots and things like that but that they

872
00:46:57,809 --> 00:46:58,059
are

873
00:46:58,049 --> 00:47:01,930
lock lock down and basically there's a
lotta redundancy they are we talk about

874
00:47:01,930 --> 00:47:03,549
a job and was short but

875
00:47:03,549 --> 00:47:06,769
actually there's a huge about a band
with its not really available so the

876
00:47:06,769 --> 00:47:10,210
basically to do something along the
lines and mesh networking

877
00:47:10,210 --> 00:47:13,920
across topologies and networks and
provide

878
00:47:13,920 --> 00:47:17,670
all they call that collectively
available to anybody who need it but you

879
00:47:17,670 --> 00:47:17,999
know

880
00:47:17,999 --> 00:47:21,339
with some kinds of restrictions that
that would be a a good thing that's his

881
00:47:21,339 --> 00:47:21,829
model

882
00:47:21,829 --> 00:47:25,839
and the business side of that there are
political side I'm not quite sure what

883
00:47:25,839 --> 00:47:28,940
the solution is a very cool idea though

884
00:47:28,940 --> 00:47:32,469
in order to Burley fully implement
division like that I don't know if TCP

885
00:47:32,469 --> 00:47:34,410
at nigga dick is all the way there

886
00:47:34,410 --> 00:47:38,089
up there are talks on emerging Internet
architecture which probably should have

887
00:47:38,089 --> 00:47:38,960
talked about that

888
00:47:38,960 --> 00:47:42,789
but I'll one you note specific type of
content delivery networks

889
00:47:42,789 --> 00:47:45,880
you know this is often used as an
example as Netflix you know a

890
00:47:45,880 --> 00:47:48,799
rather than trying to if you're if you
try to watch Netflix and it's a busy

891
00:47:48,799 --> 00:47:49,759
time a day

892
00:47:49,759 --> 00:47:52,779
you know you shouldn't just did not
request the main Netflix ever you know

893
00:47:52,779 --> 00:47:56,069
people you should be content service
that can provision the content closer to

894
00:47:56,069 --> 00:47:57,650
where it actually needs to be

895
00:47:57,650 --> 00:48:00,849
and if we stop talking about IP
addresses and start breaking down

896
00:48:00,849 --> 00:48:05,170
Internet content in terms what it
actually is then we could start to

897
00:48:05,170 --> 00:48:08,599
get to where we're trying to go a lot
quicker and indicate activity becomes a

898
00:48:08,599 --> 00:48:11,299
lot more possible in that kinda context

899
00:48:11,299 --> 00:48:15,440
awesome thanks for sharing your thoughts

900
00:48:15,440 --> 00:48:19,890
hi first offer thanks for talking booze
fast-moving arm

901
00:48:19,890 --> 00:48:24,420
with questioners I think the internets
one its greatest strength has been slack

902
00:48:24,420 --> 00:48:27,140
regulation it's like a many of these

903
00:48:27,140 --> 00:48:31,410
them current political structures we
have in them or some other areas of life

904
00:48:31,410 --> 00:48:34,849
and it's a low degree amount of
flexibility is that something

905
00:48:34,849 --> 00:48:40,079
but we really want to be aiming to to
have more open the future or

906
00:48:40,079 --> 00:48:43,900
this current chaotic architecture
actually a great strength and something

907
00:48:43,900 --> 00:48:45,680
we should strive to keep

908
00:48:45,680 --> 00:48:50,130
I'm sorry the current what architecture
but kip chaotic architecture all

909
00:48:50,130 --> 00:48:53,380
chaotic a yeah we want to

910
00:48:53,380 --> 00:48:57,619
car the design of the Internet arm

911
00:48:57,619 --> 00:49:00,950
in terms of being have permission was in
terms of your being able to

912
00:49:00,950 --> 00:49:04,509
on offer goose or raise on your own
server and so forth that is very

913
00:49:04,509 --> 00:49:05,450
important

914
00:49:05,450 --> 00:49:09,079
certainly are something that we had

915
00:49:09,079 --> 00:49:13,089
you know as a side project The your West
Side New York want everyone to be a

916
00:49:13,089 --> 00:49:15,869
first-class citizen on the internet that
is to say

917
00:49:15,869 --> 00:49:18,549
you know a lot of times Israel
residential broadband service is really

918
00:49:18,549 --> 00:49:20,950
designed for you to be a passive
consumers

919
00:49:20,950 --> 00:49:24,210
asymmetrical you can applaud as much as
you download

920
00:49:24,210 --> 00:49:27,579
you may not be allowed to have servers
in your home up

921
00:49:27,579 --> 00:49:31,749
according to the you know their a UPA
acceptable use policy whatever

922
00:49:31,749 --> 00:49:35,130
and no word were very much for just the
convo that

923
00:49:35,130 --> 00:49:38,589
a decentralized model and other things
like mesh networks

924
00:49:38,589 --> 00:49:42,499
and outside security and other kinds are
all law enforcement kinds of issues that

925
00:49:42,499 --> 00:49:43,900
I'll let you know legitimate

926
00:49:43,900 --> 00:49:48,619
on that people should be able to do what
they want that's very much for about and

927
00:49:48,619 --> 00:49:52,710
including independent you know car
community networks

928
00:49:52,710 --> 00:49:58,910
that type of thing we're very much for
that after thanks

929
00:49:58,910 --> 00:50:02,469
you talk a little bit about Tom he

930
00:50:02,469 --> 00:50:05,710
robots become economists and doing
whatever they're running with their

931
00:50:05,710 --> 00:50:09,119
in the fairies key talk a little bit
about your thoughts on now the cars

932
00:50:09,119 --> 00:50:09,670
while

933
00:50:09,670 --> 00:50:14,119
thing in the exponential increase in
technology and the singularity how that

934
00:50:14,119 --> 00:50:17,299
where all I have an opinion about the
yet to get them here

935
00:50:17,299 --> 00:50:20,450
here yet I'd like to hear your I just I
saw whom

936
00:50:20,450 --> 00:50:23,450
give a talk around militar I'm

937
00:50:23,450 --> 00:50:27,619
my I have a couple fought one iron real
I'm

938
00:50:27,619 --> 00:50:31,069
the technologist II believe that there's
something beyond

939
00:50:31,069 --> 00:50:34,869
our core technology towards the human
spirit consciousness and such

940
00:50:34,869 --> 00:50:38,430
on i think thats no I don't think that
the machines are intelligent whether he

941
00:50:38,430 --> 00:50:40,289
wins or other beings are

942
00:50:40,289 --> 00:50:43,440
I that the type intelligence we have is
radically different I think the biggest

943
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:46,029
thing to do is to understand what

944
00:50:46,029 --> 00:50:49,269
how our current technology is really
different about you but that supposedly

945
00:50:49,269 --> 00:50:50,219
intelligent

946
00:50:50,219 --> 00:50:53,279
how it's different from human or or ours

947
00:50:53,279 --> 00:50:56,650
you know organic sentience to avoid
consciousness

948
00:50:56,650 --> 00:51:00,079
and ought to understand so the ethical
and moral issues there

949
00:51:00,079 --> 00:51:03,200
I think that's very important all II you
know

950
00:51:03,200 --> 00:51:07,099
the problem I got my crystal ball little
cloudy here

951
00:51:07,099 --> 00:51:10,779
problem was lost in the continuum or
less in income is low on the light and

952
00:51:10,779 --> 00:51:14,869
so the the current kinds of technology
technology are gonna get more powerful

953
00:51:14,869 --> 00:51:17,880
but I don't really know that they are
the same as

954
00:51:17,880 --> 00:51:21,859
are organic her technology you know
technology for brains

955
00:51:21,859 --> 00:51:26,319
war the ineffable a regular thing of
consciousness which may be something

956
00:51:26,319 --> 00:51:27,529
very very different

957
00:51:27,529 --> 00:51:30,880
and you know I'm a spiritual person I
believe that there is something outside

958
00:51:30,880 --> 00:51:31,529
of

959
00:51:31,529 --> 00:51:34,849
the material that's my opinion are and
that

960
00:51:34,849 --> 00:51:39,170
that we're not going to look at that
with the core technology Edwards would

961
00:51:39,170 --> 00:51:42,329
we never got closer because it really
changed a lot was very different from

962
00:51:42,329 --> 00:51:42,859
this

963
00:51:42,859 --> 00:51:48,519
could you can up I'm pretty much in
agreement with him in the sense that

964
00:51:48,519 --> 00:51:52,599
um you we'll understand me. we
understand that even today's top

965
00:51:52,599 --> 00:51:54,009
artificial intelligence

966
00:51:54,009 --> 00:51:57,680
is it really intelligent most artists
many the artificial intelligent is

967
00:51:57,680 --> 00:52:00,690
designed to do a particular problem is
I'd be really good jeopardy it's

968
00:52:00,690 --> 00:52:03,210
designed to traverse a lot of terrain is
designed to

969
00:52:03,210 --> 00:52:06,670
make autonomous is about where to go
what the beauty of

970
00:52:06,670 --> 00:52:09,710
you know I guess human animal
intelligence as is that it's dynamic it

971
00:52:09,710 --> 00:52:10,249
can

972
00:52:10,249 --> 00:52:13,710
learn new things that really being
programmed to do so you know it it's

973
00:52:13,710 --> 00:52:14,289
extremely

974
00:52:14,289 --> 00:52:18,049
it but if we have an understanding was
that I can beauty and up but I was

975
00:52:18,049 --> 00:52:20,079
getting close so that had it there thank
you

976
00:52:20,079 --> 00:52:23,999
but the problem yeah last question

977
00:52:23,999 --> 00:52:27,739
thank you it's good denies compressor in
connection to the Internet companies

978
00:52:27,739 --> 00:52:29,749
sure I just wanted to comment quickly
that

979
00:52:29,749 --> 00:52:32,989
but to mention about the
multi-stakeholder model

980
00:52:32,989 --> 00:52:37,349
please do not make the mistake amid to
consider mothers take on a more

981
00:52:37,349 --> 00:52:40,489
as a problem of the presentation because

982
00:52:40,489 --> 00:52:43,529
the old man is national governance model
in the world it was based on

983
00:52:43,529 --> 00:52:46,890
of the back on serve the free
presentation structural representations

984
00:52:46,890 --> 00:52:48,779
and the whole idea

985
00:52:48,779 --> 00:52:52,569
of multi-stakeholder model model tries
to break up break up for that

986
00:52:52,569 --> 00:52:56,309
idea of representation and the instead
build-up

987
00:52:56,309 --> 00:53:00,619
freedom I'm liberate these pro for
people in and the Liberal Democrat

988
00:53:00,619 --> 00:53:01,410
listens to be

989
00:53:01,410 --> 00:53:04,549
open up and raise their own issues so

990
00:53:04,549 --> 00:53:08,180
I'm not leak when I say we couldn't
define a timeout try to put it down

991
00:53:08,180 --> 00:53:11,670
and the absolutely I think the Maltese
to go to modells done well wonders for

992
00:53:11,670 --> 00:53:15,329
the Internet Society the problem is that
we try and talk about what is that point

993
00:53:15,329 --> 00:53:15,969
to it

994
00:53:15,969 --> 00:53:20,019
how does it work how do we manage it
that those become tricky questions but

995
00:53:20,019 --> 00:53:20,719
in terms of

996
00:53:20,719 --> 00:53:24,150
which Internet governance model is best
I think certainly the Internet Society

997
00:53:24,150 --> 00:53:27,219
believes that the multi-stakeholder
model is the way to go

998
00:53:27,219 --> 00:53:30,369
that just doesn't mean we can't you know
they just here to tell you exactly what

999
00:53:30,369 --> 00:53:31,269
it is

1000
00:53:31,269 --> 00:53:33,529
thank you I thank you very much everyone
%ah
