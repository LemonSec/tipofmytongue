1
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:05,650
I'm is so these days a everybody knows
that nothing important gets out at the

2
00:00:05,650 --> 00:00:07,680
government unless it's a it's a lead

3
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:10,740
a you gotta maybe we have to get

4
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:14,190
leagues for correspondence from Google
in the NSA

5
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:18,619
we have to get link leaks about I how
many free information request the NSA

6
00:00:18,619 --> 00:00:19,250
gets

7
00:00:19,250 --> 00:00:23,260
we have to get leaks about the the see a
style guide

8
00:00:23,260 --> 00:00:27,340
and n in that sorted the perception is
that

9
00:00:27,340 --> 00:00:30,289
if we won anything we've gotta figure
out a way to finagle a doubt the

10
00:00:30,289 --> 00:00:32,430
government or city later get some italy
did

11
00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:35,469
on but actually that's not the case are

12
00:00:35,469 --> 00:00:40,730
so a lot of these stories are we're
actually miss attributed as leagues but

13
00:00:40,730 --> 00:00:44,480
really come from this wonderful tool
that we've we've had are called a prion

14
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:47,739
Information Act are since July 4th 1966

15
00:00:47,739 --> 00:00:50,809
has helped journalist rabble rouser is
anyone else get

16
00:00:50,809 --> 00:00:56,090
important information are the government
arm

17
00:00:56,090 --> 00:01:00,359
and while it's a lot more exciting a lot
sexier too can I say hey these documents

18
00:01:00,359 --> 00:01:02,160
were leaked in sort of secret it out

19
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:05,909
Armin in there is some danger and drama
in their something at this relatively

20
00:01:05,909 --> 00:01:06,970
benign and

21
00:01:06,970 --> 00:01:10,790
in boring tool is actually really
powerful in a really important

22
00:01:10,790 --> 00:01:15,350
inaccessible and n roll to the Safeway
for anybody to get documents they want

23
00:01:15,350 --> 00:01:16,409
on

24
00:01:16,409 --> 00:01:20,130
just two for your website's government
attic in my site mock rock

25
00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:23,810
have published over half a million pages
of previously unavailable government

26
00:01:23,810 --> 00:01:25,570
documents over the past few years

27
00:01:25,570 --> 00:01:28,810
including a lot of stuff that's later
shown up in the New York Times The

28
00:01:28,810 --> 00:01:29,659
Washington Post

29
00:01:29,659 --> 00:01:32,930
and the Wall Street Journal on earlier
this week in fact

30
00:01:32,930 --> 00:01:37,240
to today's preeminent newswoman Aires
Jon Stewart and Jerry Seinfeld on The

31
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:38,000
Daily Show

32
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,170
are reported in our groundbreaking
investigation into

33
00:01:41,170 --> 00:01:45,689
CIA cafeteria complaints on it's just
one example love

34
00:01:45,689 --> 00:01:50,280
really the the power bread for the free
Information Act arm

35
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:53,610
you can really get some amazing things a
and

36
00:01:53,610 --> 00:01:57,189
the wonderful thing about 40 is that
it's it's for anybody and you don't need

37
00:01:57,189 --> 00:01:59,229
permission to file a follow request

38
00:01:59,229 --> 00:02:03,320
this is our part where the law is on
your side arm

39
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:07,399
and the that's something that we really
hope that everybody here today

40
00:02:07,399 --> 00:02:11,830
take home with them and answer it takes
is not just acidic right but a civic

41
00:02:11,830 --> 00:02:13,739
responsibility to file requests

42
00:02:13,739 --> 00:02:18,200
on but is almost anyone everyone anyone
who has ever spent time with boy can

43
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:18,780
tell you

44
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:22,290
it's not a perfect process summer
clothes can take months

45
00:02:22,290 --> 00:02:26,190
years or even over a decade before you
see what you get riven find out if you

46
00:02:26,190 --> 00:02:27,170
will get anything

47
00:02:27,170 --> 00:02:30,830
oftentimes agencies are help or feels
like you're messing around with the

48
00:02:30,830 --> 00:02:31,700
black box

49
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:34,890
and I'll black box that even worse has
its own agenda

50
00:02:34,890 --> 00:02:38,900
are sending instructions without knowing
if anyone is taking a request seriously

51
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:42,050
or if it even going to get you what
you're interested in arm

52
00:02:42,050 --> 00:02:45,590
but I'd like you to press through that
we and no we know

53
00:02:45,590 --> 00:02:48,790
to understand the brought out we now
understand the broad outlines

54
00:02:48,790 --> 00:02:52,550
and even some other specifics about how
our government is taking watching the

55
00:02:52,550 --> 00:02:54,090
public pretty seriously

56
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:57,940
but we as a public also have an
obligation an opportunity through the

57
00:02:57,940 --> 00:03:01,080
free Information Act to watch the what
the government is doing

58
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:04,090
and boy is really essential mechanism
for doing just that

59
00:03:04,090 --> 00:03:08,040
so today we're going to talk about and
this is speaking only for myself and not

60
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:11,319
anyone else in fact I'm not quite sure
I'm speaking for myself and all

61
00:03:11,319 --> 00:03:14,780
but we're going to talk about not only
wife way is important as a former civic

62
00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:15,920
participation

63
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:19,010
we really do believe it is but also how
you can use for it to make america

64
00:03:19,010 --> 00:03:20,849
better stronger more open democracy

65
00:03:20,849 --> 00:03:24,860
the freemen Information Act really is a
unique tool were anyone can request

66
00:03:24,860 --> 00:03:26,230
documents from the government

67
00:03:26,230 --> 00:03:29,440
naps in a specific reason not to
disclose it they have to give it to you

68
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:32,670
and these are documents you have
literally already paid for

69
00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:36,670
to create through your tax dollars on a
very real way you already own them as a

70
00:03:36,670 --> 00:03:37,409
citizen any

71
00:03:37,409 --> 00:03:41,299
and as a protest bins democracy this is
not to say that all parts the government

72
00:03:41,299 --> 00:03:43,659
is subpar subject to the freedom of
information act

73
00:03:43,659 --> 00:03:47,670
in fact there are broad exceptions that
the in general the legislative and

74
00:03:47,670 --> 00:03:49,620
judicial branches are exempt from the
law

75
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:53,209
although there's agencies within those
that that you can still get things from

76
00:03:53,209 --> 00:03:54,930
through their own version for your

77
00:03:54,930 --> 00:03:59,420
as our part to the white house but that
still leaves hundreds a federal agencies

78
00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:03,209
components commissions boards and other
entities that are subject to the act

79
00:04:03,209 --> 00:04:07,390
State County Municipal local agencies
are subject to their own local and state

80
00:04:07,390 --> 00:04:11,319
records laws and four plays an important
part in something we've been hearing a

81
00:04:11,319 --> 00:04:15,069
lot about reason which is government
secrecy and government transparency

82
00:04:15,069 --> 00:04:17,570
when you send an agency employee
requests the federal government is

83
00:04:17,570 --> 00:04:18,889
supposed to presume

84
00:04:18,889 --> 00:04:21,609
that the records are public unless
there's a good reason why they should

85
00:04:21,609 --> 00:04:23,560
not be released that's a powerful tool

86
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:26,930
agencies are required to articulate why
certain documents

87
00:04:26,930 --> 00:04:30,150
should not be released if that's what
they wish to do under the president's

88
00:04:30,150 --> 00:04:31,280
very first

89
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:35,380
act in office his very first executive
order back in January 2009

90
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:38,660
he told ABC's to presume openness in
fact when he signed the slaughter he

91
00:04:38,660 --> 00:04:40,259
explicitly said the following:

92
00:04:40,259 --> 00:04:43,360
for for a long time now there's been too
much secrecy in city

93
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:46,380
the old rule rules said that if there
was a defensible argument for not

94
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:49,479
disclosing something to the american
people than it should absolutely

95
00:04:49,479 --> 00:04:53,199
then it should not be disclosed that
your is now over starting today every

96
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:56,800
agency and department should know that
this administration stands on the side

97
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:59,720
not have those who seek to withhold
information but those who seek to make

98
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:00,500
it known

99
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:03,660
this was a big change from the the
previous administration

100
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:08,160
a couple months later the Attorney
General remarkably instructed agencies

101
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:11,979
the degree to which they've listen to
him has has varied but

102
00:05:11,979 --> 00:05:16,080
to release documents whenever possible
even if technically exempt under the law

103
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:20,139
if they release would not cause what's
called foreseeable harm

104
00:05:20,139 --> 00:05:23,949
and so we have this amazing decades-old
law it it just turned 48

105
00:05:23,949 --> 00:05:28,120
on July 4th but it doesn't look a day
over thirty with a very new

106
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:31,840
aka very clear executive order to
release one it will not cause

107
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:33,610
foreseeable harm

108
00:05:33,610 --> 00:05:36,990
so if you're researching the activities
the government for you gives you

109
00:05:36,990 --> 00:05:41,310
a lot of ground to work with wanna mache
rocks users for example

110
00:05:41,310 --> 00:05:44,350
recently forward and obtain a set up
training materials from the Drug

111
00:05:44,350 --> 00:05:45,979
Enforcement Administration

112
00:05:45,979 --> 00:05:50,500
on its parallel reconstruction practices
now parallel reconstruction is an

113
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:51,990
interesting law enforcement

114
00:05:51,990 --> 00:05:55,750
practice by which the agency more or
less creates a false trail how we

115
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:57,460
discovered certain information

116
00:05:57,460 --> 00:06:00,840
to shield how the damning information
was actually found

117
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:03,669
maybe this is to hide certain
questionable investigative techniques

118
00:06:03,669 --> 00:06:05,199
innkeepers method secret

119
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:09,440
where the evidence was legally obtained
on this allows under still bringing into

120
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:10,240
court

121
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:13,819
a wall otherwise would be unusable

122
00:06:13,819 --> 00:06:18,430
arm and we got all these power point
presentations at the government created

123
00:06:18,430 --> 00:06:19,550
internally

124
00:06:19,550 --> 00:06:23,350
on how to use the sort of shady
technique to hide what they're doing

125
00:06:23,350 --> 00:06:26,410
on and what this request to received a

126
00:06:26,410 --> 00:06:29,970
really showed us a lot of new ground in
in shed light on some things we didn't

127
00:06:29,970 --> 00:06:31,380
previously know

128
00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:35,850
on including how why and when the DEA's
use parallel reconstruction

129
00:06:35,850 --> 00:06:39,660
and including that on

130
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:42,729
the written out that the DA uses
parallel reconstruction

131
00:06:42,729 --> 00:06:46,410
and only because it might now withstand
court scrutiny but because it might not

132
00:06:46,410 --> 00:06:47,240
withstand

133
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:50,539
public scrutiny if the public knew how
they're doing their job

134
00:06:50,539 --> 00:06:54,380
they specifically say are Americans
don't like it

135
00:06:54,380 --> 00:06:57,639
Martin when when we're honest about how
we do what we do

136
00:06:57,639 --> 00:07:02,020
on in this is something that he got not
from a league source not from anybody

137
00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:05,630
are soo sorta had a wrister jobber
career are going to jail

138
00:07:05,630 --> 00:07:09,310
but he filed a request with the
government and they gave it on

139
00:07:09,310 --> 00:07:12,979
on and this clue good a lot of other
really interesting material

140
00:07:12,979 --> 00:07:16,800
arm including a the fact that arm

141
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:19,810
so they they sorta had one PowerPoint
slide that

142
00:07:19,810 --> 00:07:23,590
showed here are the four ways that we
primarily go about

143
00:07:23,590 --> 00:07:26,710
arm combine in intelligence community
stuff

144
00:07:26,710 --> 00:07:30,430
with Drug Enforcement Agency stop now
are times you can get some

145
00:07:30,430 --> 00:07:33,930
kinda funny or interesting redactions
that almost more telling about the

146
00:07:33,930 --> 00:07:37,900
the agency than the stuff that they
release on so for example this is a

147
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:39,069
slide I've

148
00:07:39,069 --> 00:07:42,229
for things that they say the public is
comfortable with

149
00:07:42,229 --> 00:07:45,660
arm but they're not actually comfortable
releasing the first one of those to the

150
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:46,699
public

151
00:07:46,699 --> 00:07:52,220
arm so a siege is requested to 176 pages
of government documents

152
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:55,849
it did take nearly six months to get
those documents a back-and-forth with

153
00:07:55,849 --> 00:07:56,770
the Agencia

154
00:07:56,770 --> 00:08:00,770
being patient and persistent but only
cost a few dollars in a few minutes of

155
00:08:00,770 --> 00:08:02,020
his actual time

156
00:08:02,020 --> 00:08:05,509
and CJ didn't have to worry about
protecting his sources reporter

157
00:08:05,509 --> 00:08:08,889
on because the source was official
government channels you have to worry

158
00:08:08,889 --> 00:08:11,460
about maybe having a live the rest of
his life

159
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:14,879
you know under as a fugitive anything
out like that

160
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:18,729
on because vowing to play request is in
a quite illegal yet

161
00:08:18,729 --> 00:08:22,410
on although occasionally will come after
requesters

162
00:08:22,410 --> 00:08:26,210
who is also an incredibly powerful tool
to explore history particularly his give

163
00:08:26,210 --> 00:08:29,599
the Arbor government especially those
important perhaps controversial events

164
00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:31,530
and programs that have not fully

165
00:08:31,530 --> 00:08:35,289
seen the light of day at a government
agencies produce a wealth the

166
00:08:35,289 --> 00:08:37,490
documentation and even official
histories

167
00:08:37,490 --> 00:08:41,330
many internal just for internal use
which summarize what happened and why

168
00:08:41,330 --> 00:08:44,810
the most those materials never see the
light a day until someone asks

169
00:08:44,810 --> 00:08:48,060
asks for them under for your and they
have to find out about them to ask for

170
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:48,720
them in

171
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:51,720
that's why it's valuable to ask for
lists have such things

172
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:55,200
for example if we request prompted the
release of this history at the FBI in

173
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,040
civil rights

174
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:58,950
which was actually created for strictly
internal use to help encourage

175
00:08:58,950 --> 00:09:01,180
cooperation with the agency

176
00:09:01,180 --> 00:09:04,810
the document which act the act

177
00:09:04,810 --> 00:09:08,529
natural enough to go remarkably positive
view of the FBI history

178
00:09:08,529 --> 00:09:11,980
it describes it described how the FBI
had a long track record of helping in

179
00:09:11,980 --> 00:09:13,720
leading the way on civil rights cases

180
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:17,450
but then someone spotted an interesting
reference to the FBI's confidential file

181
00:09:17,450 --> 00:09:18,010
room

182
00:09:18,010 --> 00:09:22,630
also known as room 72 231 which held
masses have stuff they couldn't be

183
00:09:22,630 --> 00:09:23,700
stored elsewhere

184
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:28,040
even within the FBI zone file system now
one of the great really great for powers

185
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:28,779
is not

186
00:09:28,779 --> 00:09:31,740
when you ask for individual records but
when you ask for meta records things

187
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:33,769
like indexes list databases

188
00:09:33,769 --> 00:09:36,850
and other documents the don't just let
you explore one thing but hundreds or

189
00:09:36,850 --> 00:09:38,019
thousands of things

190
00:09:38,019 --> 00:09:40,810
and can help create a broader
understanding or lot times help you

191
00:09:40,810 --> 00:09:43,420
discover new things to ask for underwear

192
00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:47,080
which is exactly what happened in this
case have the confidential file room

193
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:51,320
software request was filed asking for a
copy of the FBI files about the boy

194
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:54,490
confidential file room including index
what was stored there

195
00:09:54,490 --> 00:09:57,690
ultimately a few hundred pages of
documents were released in these were

196
00:09:57,690 --> 00:10:01,310
mostly memos back and forth saying what
we want to add to the room what we want

197
00:10:01,310 --> 00:10:02,910
to take away from the room now

198
00:10:02,910 --> 00:10:06,160
and just a huge massive document over
decades

199
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:09,540
and described which files reading
removed and concerns and procedures

200
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:10,880
around the room

201
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:13,930
the file was pretty messy and it was
format it in a way it made it very

202
00:10:13,930 --> 00:10:15,720
challenging to read or two's

203
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:20,329
or to study so Amazon Mechanical Turk
was used to gather listed the file

204
00:10:20,329 --> 00:10:23,730
numbers and names that showed up in the
individual file pages page by page in it

205
00:10:23,730 --> 00:10:25,480
worked out really well

206
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:28,500
typically files were added to the
confidential file room that were

207
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:30,959
extremely sensitive were needed special
handling

208
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:34,110
such as communications regarding
interagency security matters

209
00:10:34,110 --> 00:10:37,200
which is actually a lot more interesting
than it sounds and very sensitive

210
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,880
activities and I won't go into details
but

211
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:42,230
even a large quantity there was even a
large quantity files containing

212
00:10:42,230 --> 00:10:45,450
indecent obscene or gruesome materials
are photos and the reason they were put

213
00:10:45,450 --> 00:10:48,269
there is because they were felt it was
felt that they were unfit for the

214
00:10:48,269 --> 00:10:51,600
delegate eyes are the bureau's female
file clerks so

215
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:55,130
what happened was that over time they
kept adding files the confidential file

216
00:10:55,130 --> 00:10:57,320
room and then nobody ever took the mound
and

217
00:10:57,320 --> 00:11:01,740
and the holdings grew and grew party the
file actually talked about concerns that

218
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:02,570
there were so many

219
00:11:02,570 --> 00:11:05,630
heavy file cabinets crammed with paper
that the structural integrity of the

220
00:11:05,630 --> 00:11:08,160
building floor was jeopardized the FBI
building

221
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:11,600
and eventually FBI even offer to tour
the room to reporter from The Boston

222
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:11,940
Globe

223
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:15,810
rhoda a lengthy story about a couple
years ago some the other information

224
00:11:15,810 --> 00:11:18,709
that came out was pretty incredible
including fact the FBI had sequel is a

225
00:11:18,709 --> 00:11:20,269
prominent gay individuals

226
00:11:20,269 --> 00:11:23,779
created in the fifties and sixties and
the fact that the FBI document its

227
00:11:23,779 --> 00:11:25,940
procedures around snitch jacking

228
00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:29,329
this is a a practice in which the agency
leaked false rumors that a person was

229
00:11:29,329 --> 00:11:32,670
cooperating with the FBI in order to
discredit them within the organization

230
00:11:32,670 --> 00:11:34,180
they were working with

231
00:11:34,180 --> 00:11:39,490
and so division in in this history isn't
limited to just historical interest but

232
00:11:39,490 --> 00:11:41,279
can have a real impact

233
00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:44,570
others a project called the civil rights
are called case project

234
00:11:44,570 --> 00:11:47,600
and it's a really wonderful example
above using for your

235
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:52,000
for something as is a real impact the
Civil Rights called his project is a

236
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,760
team of reporters editors documentarians

237
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:58,820
in family members have those who are
victims of unsolved civil rights cases

238
00:11:58,820 --> 00:12:04,290
from the that era it follows up on these
cases there are literally forty or fifty

239
00:12:04,290 --> 00:12:05,260
years old

240
00:12:05,260 --> 00:12:08,459
and uses for oil world history is in all
police reports

241
00:12:08,459 --> 00:12:11,959
on that they receive under public
records law to take a new look at these

242
00:12:11,959 --> 00:12:13,029
cases that

243
00:12:13,029 --> 00:12:16,570
are you can imagine the local police
back then just didn't care about them

244
00:12:16,570 --> 00:12:17,209
much

245
00:12:17,209 --> 00:12:21,300
and they've got prosecutions all these
years later you know fifty years later

246
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:25,029
they're finally prosecuting people for
murders and abductions and assaults

247
00:12:25,029 --> 00:12:28,190
on in every single one of these
investigations source a public records

248
00:12:28,190 --> 00:12:28,950
request

249
00:12:28,950 --> 00:12:32,779
asking for these old FBI files asking
for these all police reports

250
00:12:32,779 --> 00:12:36,730
in a lotta cases they they hang onto on
even though they never actually followed

251
00:12:36,730 --> 00:12:37,540
up on

252
00:12:37,540 --> 00:12:40,700
in documents that anyone can go and ask
for but

253
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:44,310
for decades nobody did ask for these
documents

254
00:12:44,310 --> 00:12:47,730
what oil is used by reporters to help us
understand what's going on

255
00:12:47,730 --> 00:12:51,190
who is also separately an incredibly
important democratic tool

256
00:12:51,190 --> 00:12:55,529
for any citizen if we're to properly
evaluate both the leadership in policies

257
00:12:55,529 --> 00:12:56,320
that work

258
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:59,110
we need to understand what our
government is up to it's as simple as

259
00:12:59,110 --> 00:12:59,740
that

260
00:12:59,740 --> 00:13:03,029
but often times I can be pretty
difficult various government agencies

261
00:13:03,029 --> 00:13:06,970
have grown fond of putting up Open Data
portals in describing that

262
00:13:06,970 --> 00:13:11,990
as transparency on and we see this a lot
particularly at the the city in federal

263
00:13:11,990 --> 00:13:12,810
level

264
00:13:12,810 --> 00:13:16,889
arm in those those data portals are
really wonderful on end and the great

265
00:13:16,889 --> 00:13:18,010
thing to see in

266
00:13:18,010 --> 00:13:21,420
any means that we can now in a lotta
cities map elbows time in

267
00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:26,339
in real time but just as important as a
as what the government is eager to share

268
00:13:26,339 --> 00:13:29,990
is answering the questions that the
public as well government operations

269
00:13:29,990 --> 00:13:33,040
and sometimes those to match up arm and
sometimes they don't

270
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:37,730
info is a great way to remedy that over
the past two years mock rock has been

271
00:13:37,730 --> 00:13:38,389
what's

272
00:13:38,389 --> 00:13:41,750
I'll work on line are the drone census a

273
00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:44,690
a large-scale look at how unmanned
aerial vehicles are being used across

274
00:13:44,690 --> 00:13:45,839
the country

275
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:49,040
weaving came up with a fun little ok for

276
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:54,060
on in mock rock served as a platform for
users to follow about 700 requires

277
00:13:54,060 --> 00:13:58,079
a actually one request more last seven
hundred times

278
00:13:58,079 --> 00:14:01,980
with agencies all across the country at
the state local and federal level

279
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:06,480
askin what have you bought any drones do
you have planned by drones do you have

280
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:08,250
any policy around drones

281
00:14:08,250 --> 00:14:11,910
Armin we invited anybody the comment and
submit an agency that they were curious

282
00:14:11,910 --> 00:14:12,570
about

283
00:14:12,570 --> 00:14:15,839
and sometimes people have a good reason
to think that agency I drones and

284
00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:17,699
sometimes there just curious

285
00:14:17,699 --> 00:14:21,190
arm mostly people suggested police
departments

286
00:14:21,190 --> 00:14:24,279
where should we file we asked and and
why do you think this

287
00:14:24,279 --> 00:14:28,079
this some agency might have a drone with
hundreds and hundreds of people right

288
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:28,740
and

289
00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:32,360
I maybe they had heard something from a
friend maybe they saw something

290
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:34,070
suspicious about their house

291
00:14:34,070 --> 00:14:37,500
are one person actually emailed me a
video of what looked like they were

292
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:40,480
being chased around by a flashlight
inside their living room

293
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:44,430
arm but we went ahead we filed a request
in that city

294
00:14:44,430 --> 00:14:48,389
harm and a and we found some really
surprising staff

295
00:14:48,389 --> 00:14:52,670
I mean some other the request that we
thought were a little bonkers at first

296
00:14:52,670 --> 00:14:56,070
it turns out that a lot of the small
town random police departments

297
00:14:56,070 --> 00:14:59,490
ilana cases did by drones on and there
was

298
00:14:59,490 --> 00:15:02,810
it was surprising to us and an even
weirder was surprising to some

299
00:15:02,810 --> 00:15:07,019
some other towns in the agencies that we
filed with for example the Maine State

300
00:15:07,019 --> 00:15:08,050
Police

301
00:15:08,050 --> 00:15:11,170
you know I heard about drones and and
while the police officers there was

302
00:15:11,170 --> 00:15:12,529
pretty jazzed about him

303
00:15:12,529 --> 00:15:16,130
are so isn't somebody to local Verizon
store and they picked up

304
00:15:16,130 --> 00:15:19,459
you know when those two hundred dollar
route RV drones on

305
00:15:19,459 --> 00:15:23,639
in aid they were playing around with it
and plan to use it for tactical purposes

306
00:15:23,639 --> 00:15:26,779
which is perfectly legal to buy a drone
it's a

307
00:15:26,779 --> 00:15:30,740
you need F in a you need an FAA permit
to use it for anything beyond obvious

308
00:15:30,740 --> 00:15:31,519
permit

309
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:35,170
purposes and they didn't have a permit
and we said

310
00:15:35,170 --> 00:15:38,620
why don't you have a permit they said
what the heck are you talking about we

311
00:15:38,620 --> 00:15:39,490
don't need a permit

312
00:15:39,490 --> 00:15:42,839
on and we explain that actually yes they
do in

313
00:15:42,839 --> 00:15:46,389
and so they say well I I guess we're not
going to be using that for

314
00:15:46,389 --> 00:15:49,779
for actual missions on and they

315
00:15:49,779 --> 00:15:53,040
they didn't understand why this pesky
reporter was calling up

316
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:58,320
in asking until it was or to explain to
them in info is a really powerful tool

317
00:15:58,320 --> 00:15:58,980
that

318
00:15:58,980 --> 00:16:02,139
even when agencies don't realize they're
doing something wrong you can

319
00:16:02,139 --> 00:16:05,920
get some documentation to prove their
and that's a relatively benign

320
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:09,660
you know a state police officers saying
thinking these drones are cool and they

321
00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:10,509
are cool

322
00:16:10,509 --> 00:16:14,100
on you know just ignoring federal on the
process

323
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:17,329
but there is a lot more interesting
cases to on

324
00:16:17,329 --> 00:16:20,730
such as the Seattle Police Department
bought two drones

325
00:16:20,730 --> 00:16:24,259
9 2010 for a little over eighty two
thousand dollars

326
00:16:24,259 --> 00:16:27,360
and then did some training for its
officers a

327
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:32,009
and then they didn't told the city
council didn't tell anybody

328
00:16:32,009 --> 00:16:35,230
really on and they all this money from
Homeland Security

329
00:16:35,230 --> 00:16:38,639
and they bought these drones and im
pretty substantial drones little more

330
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:39,920
than your horizon one

331
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:44,320
on and they're getting ready to use it
for operational purposes

332
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:48,149
and then somebody filed a request and it
came out that they had drones in the

333
00:16:48,149 --> 00:16:49,089
city said

334
00:16:49,089 --> 00:16:52,459
we're really not comfortable with you
running these drones you

335
00:16:52,459 --> 00:16:56,490
need to not use them and he said fine we
we won't use them right now

336
00:16:56,490 --> 00:16:59,850
arm and then somebody a little later
file another player request

337
00:16:59,850 --> 00:17:03,350
and instead a not using them they were
trying to buy two more drones

338
00:17:03,350 --> 00:17:08,089
on and so after the second play request
they made Seattle get rid of the drones

339
00:17:08,089 --> 00:17:13,490
on a after they finally said okay we can
trust you to get rid of these we needed

340
00:17:13,490 --> 00:17:14,760
a document game rhythm

341
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:18,240
and it turns out that they can return
them to the manufacturer so they a

342
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:21,990
the game down other friends in LA on

343
00:17:21,990 --> 00:17:26,400
a Anna and then this happens time and
time again where

344
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:31,470
where if somebody if an individual
whether that's you are somebody else

345
00:17:31,470 --> 00:17:35,000
is in asking these questions and find
these requests

346
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:40,250
literally nobody is a and I think that's
that's really one of the things that

347
00:17:40,250 --> 00:17:44,520
that I took away from this is that so
many towns that we interact with that

348
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:49,450
mock rock a we might be filing the first
request the town is seen in years

349
00:17:49,450 --> 00:17:52,770
on in with with some federal agencies
even we're

350
00:17:52,770 --> 00:17:56,200
wanna very few people asking questions
on

351
00:17:56,200 --> 00:18:00,070
and since these repressed we they do
have an impact Seattle police had to

352
00:18:00,070 --> 00:18:02,820
give back their drone a few other
departments have had to

353
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:06,350
I never explain why they lied in
document responses

354
00:18:06,350 --> 00:18:09,950
are one really interesting case we filed
a request the San Diego

355
00:18:09,950 --> 00:18:13,710
on San Diego said we have no drones
we've never talked about drones we don't

356
00:18:13,710 --> 00:18:14,980
know what a drone is

357
00:18:14,980 --> 00:18:18,600
go away you 10 oil tin foil hat person

358
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:23,179
on essentially and then a a request to
another city

359
00:18:23,179 --> 00:18:27,600
came back with a signed contract that
the the police in san diego good sign

360
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:28,460
for a drone

361
00:18:28,460 --> 00:18:32,380
arm so you can find some really
surprising things when you when you ask

362
00:18:32,380 --> 00:18:33,419
around widely

363
00:18:33,419 --> 00:18:37,690
arm and its it's great to sorta have
these direct impacts on police

364
00:18:37,690 --> 00:18:39,679
departments is just a regular citizen

365
00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:43,160
but more importantly public records
gives people a sense of what's happening

366
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:45,750
in their name with with their tax
dollars

367
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:48,980
on we started doing a summer project
with Sting Ray technology which are

368
00:18:48,980 --> 00:18:51,049
basically these fake cell phone towers

369
00:18:51,049 --> 00:18:54,610
that police can put up and grab call on
location data a wholesale

370
00:18:54,610 --> 00:18:57,730
crazy enough the makers are these
devices

371
00:18:57,730 --> 00:19:01,419
you know we're kinda worried even for
his road sign on that people might ask

372
00:19:01,419 --> 00:19:04,770
asking questions like is this legal is
this ethical

373
00:19:04,770 --> 00:19:08,419
are the people who use this who can't
even operate a fax machine properly

374
00:19:08,419 --> 00:19:11,640
properly trained to to use the
surveillance equipment

375
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:14,789
and so the Stingray manufacturers often
put in

376
00:19:14,789 --> 00:19:18,360
part of the contract this is they're not
allowed to talk about

377
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:22,210
what they buy and how they're using it
arm but of course most

378
00:19:22,210 --> 00:19:25,590
those agreements are available under
public records

379
00:19:25,590 --> 00:19:29,470
wanna I should add here that it if if
someone files a request and someone else

380
00:19:29,470 --> 00:19:32,480
files request in third person balls
request first

381
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:36,990
some sort of data from state or federal
or local city agency

382
00:19:36,990 --> 00:19:40,720
they pretty quickly get the message that
there's interest there and it does tend

383
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:41,260
to

384
00:19:41,260 --> 00:19:45,400
encouraged proactive posting up this
kind of data that is about obvious

385
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:46,799
interest to the public

386
00:19:46,799 --> 00:19:49,660
in fact in the federal law that
encourages agencies to post anything

387
00:19:49,660 --> 00:19:51,260
online that they've gotten

388
00:19:51,260 --> 00:19:54,690
at least three weeks well they say that
they're likely to get more requests for

389
00:19:54,690 --> 00:19:58,020
use the agency's interpret that as if
they've gotten three requests thats

390
00:19:58,020 --> 00:20:01,950
public interest but that will often spur
them to do it because it's just frankly

391
00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:04,490
easier to post it online in to ski
paneling

392
00:20:04,490 --> 00:20:09,010
these annoying requests for the same
information over and over again

393
00:20:09,010 --> 00:20:12,350
so what can you do one of the great
things about 40 is that it's accessible

394
00:20:12,350 --> 00:20:14,070
to everyone not just journalists

395
00:20:14,070 --> 00:20:18,000
anyone's permitted to file a Freedom of
Information request in law guarantees

396
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,960
that right and it can be very simple

397
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:23,330
here's an illustration put up put
together a couple years ago by Phil

398
00:20:23,330 --> 00:20:24,880
Lapsley the author of the book

399
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:29,210
exploding the phone: thanks Phil and I
liked it so much we're gonna recycler

400
00:20:29,210 --> 00:20:30,090
today so

401
00:20:30,090 --> 00:20:33,380
take some careful notes because this is
what's required for no formal official

402
00:20:33,380 --> 00:20:34,770
for your request

403
00:20:34,770 --> 00:20:39,179
first it must state it's a boy request
in must describe the records you can't

404
00:20:39,179 --> 00:20:43,159
really ask questions only for something
that exists in some tangible form

405
00:20:43,159 --> 00:20:47,309
you have to indicate what you should
indicate would be category in our UN

406
00:20:47,309 --> 00:20:50,690
on individual requester which is called
all others

407
00:20:50,690 --> 00:20:54,250
are you news media are you in education
or scientific

408
00:20:54,250 --> 00:20:57,720
requester or are you a commercial
requester

409
00:20:57,720 --> 00:21:00,799
and a commercial requesters get he's
loaded on

410
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:04,289
individual non-commercial requesters
don't news media peak

411
00:21:04,289 --> 00:21:08,360
the news media requesters get even
muskie's and you must state a

412
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:10,720
willingness to pay a fee you can say I
agree to pay

413
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:13,880
he's up to twenty-five dollars without
my for the permission or

414
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:18,030
please notify me if these are expected
to exceed fifteen dollars or

415
00:21:18,030 --> 00:21:21,090
you have to put something in there they
expect to see it otherwise lot times

416
00:21:21,090 --> 00:21:22,150
agencies will say that

417
00:21:22,150 --> 00:21:25,400
their request has been perfected so
we're gonna send it back

418
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:31,070
on and it's good to include a way for
the agency to respond to such as email

419
00:21:31,070 --> 00:21:36,070
on mailing address that's very important

420
00:21:36,070 --> 00:21:39,549
and my goal today is for you to try this
yourself

421
00:21:39,549 --> 00:21:43,230
you can exercise this beautiful right
you have to file a Freedom of

422
00:21:43,230 --> 00:21:44,490
Information Act request

423
00:21:44,490 --> 00:21:48,350
and dig up some information you finance
chain are useful or you think the world

424
00:21:48,350 --> 00:21:49,080
should know

425
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:52,230
they can be for some historical FBI
files are how your local police

426
00:21:52,230 --> 00:21:54,580
department as police in your
neighborhood

427
00:21:54,580 --> 00:21:58,870
or for airline inspections water quality
here's a traveler pro tip for body

428
00:21:58,870 --> 00:21:59,299
fluids

429
00:21:59,299 --> 00:22:02,429
your never drink airline coffee ever on

430
00:22:02,429 --> 00:22:06,390
and will make it even easier for you by
giving you a few thousand templates

431
00:22:06,390 --> 00:22:10,520
that you're more than welcome to
borrower copy as much as you want to

432
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:14,270
are you can browse over 10,000 requests
which are all public from the very first

433
00:22:14,270 --> 00:22:15,700
initial request

434
00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:19,520
to the appeal to when we get the
eventual document said Mike Brock dot

435
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:20,530
com

436
00:22:20,530 --> 00:22:23,750
on and that recruits request in every
state

437
00:22:23,750 --> 00:22:28,200
plus DC plus of course with federal
agencies all which has sometimes

438
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:31,450
slightly or sometimes very different
laws

439
00:22:31,450 --> 00:22:34,539
and on the government addicts say you
can examine the results a request to the

440
00:22:34,539 --> 00:22:35,409
foyer logs

441
00:22:35,409 --> 00:22:39,789
they are posted or go to a particular
agency INSEE examples and documents that

442
00:22:39,789 --> 00:22:42,690
have been released by that agency which
often is helpful because a lot of times

443
00:22:42,690 --> 00:22:44,650
agencies will say we don't give out that

444
00:22:44,650 --> 00:22:47,799
we don't disclose that all that's
totally exempt in any show them

445
00:22:47,799 --> 00:22:51,470
that not only have they given out two
years ago but other agencies get out the

446
00:22:51,470 --> 00:22:52,940
same thing

447
00:22:52,940 --> 00:22:56,190
all the time and it its there's a lot to
turn over in these

448
00:22:56,190 --> 00:23:00,409
boy offices and people are not familiar
with what's been released before in

449
00:23:00,409 --> 00:23:04,210
and it somewhat persuasive to show that
yes you have actually really stuff like

450
00:23:04,210 --> 00:23:05,130
this before in

451
00:23:05,130 --> 00:23:08,179
it hasn't caused the into the world

452
00:23:08,179 --> 00:23:11,980
sold the lesser documents that have been
released what's called a flake a slog

453
00:23:11,980 --> 00:23:15,450
is often very helpful I help promote the
idea that

454
00:23:15,450 --> 00:23:18,669
many years ago and it's become very
popular which is Tom

455
00:23:18,669 --> 00:23:22,770
identifying who's asking for what in
hopefully without intruding on too much

456
00:23:22,770 --> 00:23:23,590
privacy

457
00:23:23,590 --> 00:23:27,590
it gives a sense of what kinda documents
the agency has been providing it and

458
00:23:27,590 --> 00:23:29,010
people have been asking for which is

459
00:23:29,010 --> 00:23:32,720
useful looking get to a point we say I
wanna I want to ask for this but I'm not

460
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:34,400
sure quite how to frame it or what

461
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:39,159
how did put in the form of describing it
as a record

462
00:23:39,159 --> 00:23:43,890
on because the black box that is where
sometimes has its own agenda or genders

463
00:23:43,890 --> 00:23:45,100
or can be a complex

464
00:23:45,100 --> 00:23:48,890
structure agendas the and

465
00:23:48,890 --> 00:23:52,610
voyeurs in intricate an interesting
craft

466
00:23:52,610 --> 00:23:56,900
its best done as a partisan activity
rather than a spectator sport

467
00:23:56,900 --> 00:24:00,500
so we have two workshops envoy will be
running this afternoon

468
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:04,289
in the EU room is listed as on the sixth
floor but they've moved it for other for

469
00:24:04,289 --> 00:24:07,380
reasons that are unknown to me to the
you room which is down the hall

470
00:24:07,380 --> 00:24:11,200
and the first workshop belief way 101 a
basic nuts-and-bolts

471
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:15,220
oil or workshop from 1 30 with 2 230 and
the second is

472
00:24:15,220 --> 00:24:18,809
avoid van strategies and tactics from 3
to 4 p.m.

473
00:24:18,809 --> 00:24:22,820
in which will cover some the more
detailed discussion on how to get into

474
00:24:22,820 --> 00:24:24,460
the strategies above

475
00:24:24,460 --> 00:24:29,350
answering requests responses that are
not very helpful or deny records

476
00:24:29,350 --> 00:24:32,990
Sean musgrave for mock rock will be
helping with with the first one in

477
00:24:32,990 --> 00:24:37,700
and noted way attorney Cal mcclanahan is
here will be helping with the second one

478
00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:41,559
will be glad to take will be glad to
work

479
00:24:41,559 --> 00:24:44,710
in more detail with you on those and and
thank you very much and we'll be happy

480
00:24:44,710 --> 00:24:49,580
to take your questions

481
00:24:49,580 --> 00:24:56,580
way

482
00:24:57,460 --> 00:25:04,460
you there in the dark I we can see
anything out here

483
00:25:12,039 --> 00:25:16,289
well yeah hi I was wondering if there's
anything in the law or any amendments

484
00:25:16,289 --> 00:25:17,610
that state to

485
00:25:17,610 --> 00:25:21,740
form Mike standard formats that the date
is presented in or can

486
00:25:21,740 --> 00:25:26,990
agencies just give you like a tape that
has no returns like go over records are

487
00:25:26,990 --> 00:25:27,730
on this

488
00:25:27,730 --> 00:25:31,880
they have occasionally done that arm
they

489
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:35,370
there's a lot of encouragement or to
given in its native

490
00:25:35,370 --> 00:25:39,809
data format I'm usually that they can
exported to Excel format if it's a

491
00:25:39,809 --> 00:25:40,549
database

492
00:25:40,549 --> 00:25:45,620
arm the usually if its email the usually
print out those emails and give that to

493
00:25:45,620 --> 00:25:46,010
you

494
00:25:46,010 --> 00:25:49,940
number you can kinda push back an ass
for the original native format I haven't

495
00:25:49,940 --> 00:25:52,649
seen in a long time where they've given
it to you and something that's

496
00:25:52,649 --> 00:25:53,559
completely

497
00:25:53,559 --> 00:25:57,950
unreadable arm it's happened what
happens in that matters

498
00:25:57,950 --> 00:26:01,100
i've seen a situation that it took about
eight years for us to figure how to

499
00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:05,730
open up this we're data format on
difficult data cartridge but

500
00:26:05,730 --> 00:26:09,500
we didn't get the results that is
therefore Sastri indexed artwork

501
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:13,049
which is a compilation of all the Air
Force historical

502
00:26:13,049 --> 00:26:16,610
research paper some 109 hundred thousand
of them

503
00:26:16,610 --> 00:26:19,779
from the Air Force historical research
center and actually they use that as

504
00:26:19,779 --> 00:26:20,720
their index

505
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:23,970
more now than their own system which is
very arm

506
00:26:23,970 --> 00:26:28,480
buggy and they have been rewritten it
and its phone parts and it's protected

507
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:30,570
by all kinds a password protection so
they

508
00:26:30,570 --> 00:26:34,340
they like the the air force's tree index
down we're very much

509
00:26:34,340 --> 00:26:37,980
on in general the law says that you can
ask for records

510
00:26:37,980 --> 00:26:41,500
in uniform that the that their
maintained and so they're maintaining a

511
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:44,110
particular form if it's an excel file
the dump it out onto

512
00:26:44,110 --> 00:26:49,529
fuzzy PDF pages then the UN you in
theory can go back and say no I wanted

513
00:26:49,529 --> 00:26:52,330
in Excel it's good to specify that you
want something in a digital or

514
00:26:52,330 --> 00:26:53,740
electronic format because

515
00:26:53,740 --> 00:26:56,850
it's much cheaper to get it that way
they're not printing out loads a paper

516
00:26:56,850 --> 00:26:59,070
that you knocking people use varies
leaves Canon

517
00:26:59,070 --> 00:27:02,500
arm but as sometimes they will work with
you to do with them

518
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:05,870
you know if you ask for dinner give them
a couple choices a data formats they

519
00:27:05,870 --> 00:27:07,380
sometimes can talk to do it.

520
00:27:07,380 --> 00:27:10,590
IT people and give it to you but they
are required to give it to you informant

521
00:27:10,590 --> 00:27:11,559
they have it in so

522
00:27:11,559 --> 00:27:17,190
that helps thank you for your work hey

523
00:27:17,190 --> 00:27:20,220
so a journalist in I full I filed

524
00:27:20,220 --> 00:27:24,049
where requests like both using like the
monster is like my crock and McKenna the

525
00:27:24,049 --> 00:27:25,600
old-fashioned way and I just kinda

526
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:29,110
curious if you think that there's any
kind of advantage or disadvantage to

527
00:27:29,110 --> 00:27:30,289
using something

528
00:27:30,289 --> 00:27:34,080
that kinda like it like mock rock which
they're just post everything publicly

529
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:35,980
like all the correspondent happens
publicly

530
00:27:35,980 --> 00:27:39,159
as opposed to serve like you know
something like for a machine which is

531
00:27:39,159 --> 00:27:39,519
that

532
00:27:39,519 --> 00:27:43,220
the service that kinda just like
basically links your email to you

533
00:27:43,220 --> 00:27:46,320
the correspondent as it goes out to you
like I mean have you

534
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:49,789
seen any kind advantage or disadvantage
to either does methods

535
00:27:49,789 --> 00:27:53,230
I think it'll be mostly depends on water
that that

536
00:27:53,230 --> 00:27:57,629
sort of persons goals in are you know if
you're going to get something sensitive

537
00:27:57,629 --> 00:27:58,710
like your own files

538
00:27:58,710 --> 00:28:02,419
I E don't recommend using my crock
because we poster it thing in a you

539
00:28:02,419 --> 00:28:03,510
don't pry don't live here

540
00:28:03,510 --> 00:28:07,000
whatever the FBI has on you on you know
i i think

541
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:11,360
you know one thing we've seen is that
some people sorta traditionally

542
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:16,240
a lot of the best way experts can tree
for a like their own personal goldmine

543
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:19,690
in one thing that i think is is helpful
as a you have more people

544
00:28:19,690 --> 00:28:24,450
mean like a who are are sharing things
rate you know we have these wonderful

545
00:28:24,450 --> 00:28:26,500
sites that we can upload documents

546
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:30,200
we have sites like government attic that
poser sites like Mike rockin for

547
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:30,870
emission

548
00:28:30,870 --> 00:28:34,399
then encourage publication stuff and for
some people

549
00:28:34,399 --> 00:28:36,990
I think it depends on their questions or
to what their goals are for their

550
00:28:36,990 --> 00:28:37,529
request

551
00:28:37,529 --> 00:28:41,269
there's a big controversy brewing right
now in terms of something called for

552
00:28:41,269 --> 00:28:42,340
your portals which

553
00:28:42,340 --> 00:28:45,850
our government agency sites which

554
00:28:45,850 --> 00:28:49,179
a administer for a && take

555
00:28:49,179 --> 00:28:52,590
take care of some other back and forth
electronically because some people are

556
00:28:52,590 --> 00:28:54,610
concerned especially reporters are
concerned if

557
00:28:54,610 --> 00:28:57,970
if everything is posted that they're
doing in real time

558
00:28:57,970 --> 00:29:01,260
%uh what's the incentive for them to go
out and try to dig up a story that their

559
00:29:01,260 --> 00:29:01,950
competitors are

560
00:29:01,950 --> 00:29:05,019
can jump on immediately they they see
the need for sharing they like

561
00:29:05,019 --> 00:29:06,320
transparency but they

562
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:11,179
they would like to be able to do their
jobs and there's a tension between the

563
00:29:11,179 --> 00:29:12,309
need for openness

564
00:29:12,309 --> 00:29:15,809
and reporters wanting to share but not
wanting to share actually right away

565
00:29:15,809 --> 00:29:17,159
until they rate their story

566
00:29:17,159 --> 00:29:20,480
and agencies sometimes go a little bit

567
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:23,730
overboard a and want to post

568
00:29:23,730 --> 00:29:27,649
all the requests with all the
information about the requesters right

569
00:29:27,649 --> 00:29:31,010
away and that that sort of causing some
concerns although people would like to

570
00:29:31,010 --> 00:29:33,600
see what's been requested they also
understand that they're certain

571
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:34,889
circumstances where

572
00:29:34,889 --> 00:29:38,789
somebody might not want the fact that a
personal piece of information is being

573
00:29:38,789 --> 00:29:40,260
requested are they have

574
00:29:40,260 --> 00:29:44,379
you know a spouse thats trying to find
them or something or there's a reporter

575
00:29:44,379 --> 00:29:45,990
who's trying to do a story

576
00:29:45,990 --> 00:29:49,909
so that's a a controversy that's that's
definitely in the works right now as the

577
00:29:49,909 --> 00:29:55,610
government works toward more these for
your portals

578
00:29:55,610 --> 00:29:58,639
sigh I think as you mentioned you can on

579
00:29:58,639 --> 00:30:02,860
do for a request for your own personal
records that any government agency has

580
00:30:02,860 --> 00:30:06,169
you can also do the four requests dead
people who don't seem to have civil

581
00:30:06,169 --> 00:30:07,080
rights anymore

582
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:10,799
it's a wonderful way to dig up
information you wanting why you wanna

583
00:30:10,799 --> 00:30:14,119
bet that old story but a grandfather
being arrested by the FBI well

584
00:30:14,119 --> 00:30:18,679
get this file well there is a website
that was a startup II was one the

585
00:30:18,679 --> 00:30:19,950
cofounder so that

586
00:30:19,950 --> 00:30:23,899
get grandpa's FBI file dot com a

587
00:30:23,899 --> 00:30:27,139
and I have no idea really %uh and

588
00:30:27,139 --> 00:30:31,070
get my FBI file dot com which is the
companion site and it it

589
00:30:31,070 --> 00:30:35,460
it deals exactly with that issue its
it's not doesn't cover all the agencies

590
00:30:35,460 --> 00:30:39,010
its it gives you sort of a starting
point for people at no idea

591
00:30:39,010 --> 00:30:42,820
it was intended as a mean to spread
through the genealogy community in other

592
00:30:42,820 --> 00:30:45,179
people were interested in finding out
about what

593
00:30:45,179 --> 00:30:48,889
what's there are but it's more
generalized I mean if if you're

594
00:30:48,889 --> 00:30:52,100
if you're a reporter interest in history
of a certain area in you want to get the

595
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:54,460
FBI followed some themes person to die
that's a

596
00:30:54,460 --> 00:30:58,039
useful quick way to to create the letter
and you don't have to put in any

597
00:30:58,039 --> 00:31:01,190
personal information is bring out the
forms and they're all black n

598
00:31:01,190 --> 00:31:04,510
film in manually if you want or you can
do it online and have a print out a nice

599
00:31:04,510 --> 00:31:05,179
letter for you

600
00:31:05,179 --> 00:31:09,090
enough if your gonna do that I recommend
if you're curious about that sort of

601
00:31:09,090 --> 00:31:11,970
thing don't wait till next week or next
month or next year

602
00:31:11,970 --> 00:31:15,869
as documents get destroyed I mean it's
something we we are seen as

603
00:31:15,869 --> 00:31:18,909
there's a massive document destruction
taking place

604
00:31:18,909 --> 00:31:23,119
a because the FBI was running out a room
for example other agencies

605
00:31:23,119 --> 00:31:26,629
don't need to keep things for ever they
feel any they've been no

606
00:31:26,629 --> 00:31:29,820
a.m. mining this tough titty

607
00:31:29,820 --> 00:31:33,659
either sense elective items to the
National Archives or to get rid of an

608
00:31:33,659 --> 00:31:34,289
entirely

609
00:31:34,289 --> 00:31:36,990
so there's some things that are being
saved for historical reasons for

610
00:31:36,990 --> 00:31:38,470
historical preservation

611
00:31:38,470 --> 00:31:42,029
but the vast majority of material from
the 20th century is being

612
00:31:42,029 --> 00:31:46,580
destroyed and so if you want something
it's good to ask for it right away

613
00:31:46,580 --> 00:31:51,129
how often do you find that did the
documents that you get in your opinion

614
00:31:51,129 --> 00:31:54,789
are overly redacted and how do you
handle that situation

615
00:31:54,789 --> 00:31:58,730
if if there's any national security
implications at all

616
00:31:58,730 --> 00:32:02,580
I mean that's that's why the big ships
is that post-9/11 its

617
00:32:02,580 --> 00:32:06,399
its everybody loves Clark lameee
national security for everything

618
00:32:06,399 --> 00:32:09,629
on II work in Boston and and

619
00:32:09,629 --> 00:32:14,510
a reporter in Boston filed a request for
parking ticket date in watertown

620
00:32:14,510 --> 00:32:18,500
on and the Watertown police said that's
national security

621
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:21,960
on after the the bonds and it's it's Lee

622
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:26,250
want arm in UC ridiculous stuff like
that

623
00:32:26,250 --> 00:32:29,340
but you can push back on any we got
stuff on on

624
00:32:29,340 --> 00:32:33,279
you know we have found you can get a lot
of really interesting material

625
00:32:33,279 --> 00:32:37,159
a 1-over users just filed a request for
project Aurora

626
00:32:37,159 --> 00:32:41,809
on documents recently and we got all the
stuff about government test in

627
00:32:41,809 --> 00:32:46,480
cyberattacks and non and I was surprised
that we gotta love that a lot of that

628
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:48,429
was on redact in that time out

629
00:32:48,429 --> 00:32:51,610
critical infrastructure material arm and
it was all reviewed

630
00:32:51,610 --> 00:32:55,700
and they did redact certain pieces of it
but they gave us on that stuff

631
00:32:55,700 --> 00:32:59,119
arm if you're talking about NSA or CIA

632
00:32:59,119 --> 00:33:02,590
your almost certainly not going to get
much arm

633
00:33:02,590 --> 00:33:05,970
although one ever users if on offer here

634
00:33:05,970 --> 00:33:09,679
god's has had really good success
getting in it some NSA contracts

635
00:33:09,679 --> 00:33:13,519
and it seems mixed success sometimes
I'll give it to you sometimes they won't

636
00:33:13,519 --> 00:33:17,210
on but you know they can can say oh
we're working with with the security

637
00:33:17,210 --> 00:33:18,340
firm

638
00:33:18,340 --> 00:33:21,960
for example so it's it's possible what
it is trickier

639
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:26,029
I'll I would say that I've observed ed
in general if the request is actually

640
00:33:26,029 --> 00:33:26,779
processed

641
00:33:26,779 --> 00:33:29,950
which is a big step because a lot of
times agencies

642
00:33:29,950 --> 00:33:34,080
use a set of criteria to toss it back if
they don't feel meet certain criteria

643
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:37,899
arm whether it's justified or not but I
C 70 75 percent

644
00:33:37,899 --> 00:33:41,010
maybe eighty percent even other requests
I was

645
00:33:41,010 --> 00:33:45,280
the are can be received in and have a

646
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:48,419
what people would consider a reasonable
response a

647
00:33:48,419 --> 00:33:52,190
in the cases where it's not its it's a
good idea to use the administrative

648
00:33:52,190 --> 00:33:56,149
appeal process and it actually does work
in and you can add identify

649
00:33:56,149 --> 00:33:59,220
for example you can show the agency
where they've they've given out things

650
00:33:59,220 --> 00:34:01,720
like that before and they haven't
blacked out these things are other

651
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:02,539
people are

652
00:34:02,539 --> 00:34:05,879
you can find different ways of showing
that what they've claimed is not

653
00:34:05,879 --> 00:34:07,030
necessarily

654
00:34:07,030 --> 00:34:10,179
the case for example if they're claiming
privacy in the person has been dead for

655
00:34:10,179 --> 00:34:11,690
twenty years then maybe it's not

656
00:34:11,690 --> 00:34:14,919
such in necessary thing for them to
claim and

657
00:34:14,919 --> 00:34:18,790
a I should say also that for national
security information there's a separate

658
00:34:18,790 --> 00:34:19,790
track besides

659
00:34:19,790 --> 00:34:22,970
where that's called mandatory
declassification review are not go into

660
00:34:22,970 --> 00:34:23,799
details here

661
00:34:23,799 --> 00:34:26,460
it's a totally separate track use or
have to pick which one you want you

662
00:34:26,460 --> 00:34:27,429
can't do both

663
00:34:27,429 --> 00:34:31,929
and the same document requested under
Floyd if it's classified the agency says

664
00:34:31,929 --> 00:34:32,799
class by

665
00:34:32,799 --> 00:34:36,179
it stays class white on appeal maybe
even if you go to court the court might

666
00:34:36,179 --> 00:34:38,799
agree because the courts don't look too
carefully dad

667
00:34:38,799 --> 00:34:43,149
kinda thing on if it goes through voyeur
in there might only be a 10 percent

668
00:34:43,149 --> 00:34:44,220
chance you get it

669
00:34:44,220 --> 00:34:48,129
if it goes through MDR there's like a 90
percent chance this is the same document

670
00:34:48,129 --> 00:34:50,639
been reviewed by people who are using
the same criteria

671
00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:54,780
so that strange in the explanation for
that is the top appeal level for

672
00:34:54,780 --> 00:34:58,160
mandatory declassification review is
this inter-agency committee it's been

673
00:34:58,160 --> 00:34:59,960
pretty good about the class findings

674
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:03,580
whereas for way have to go to the courts
in the judge's they say we give

675
00:35:03,580 --> 00:35:05,119
discretion to we we

676
00:35:05,119 --> 00:35:08,700
allow the agency's basically make their
decisions in we we defer their

677
00:35:08,700 --> 00:35:10,810
decision-making on classified materials

678
00:35:10,810 --> 00:35:13,760
and this can be classified stuff that's
fifty years old sixty years old

679
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:14,859
seven-years-old

680
00:35:14,859 --> 00:35:18,830
there's classified stuff that's arm at a
hundred or more years old

681
00:35:18,830 --> 00:35:22,880
believe it or not so so you should be
aware that MDR track

682
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:26,470
which is what it's called for classified
type: materials if you think its class

683
00:35:26,470 --> 00:35:29,640
by

684
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:32,680
where do you see mock rock in the next
few years but kinda features

685
00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:34,279
enhancements are you

686
00:35:34,279 --> 00:35:37,799
thinking about are yeah um so

687
00:35:37,799 --> 00:35:42,569
when we built mock rock we it was I was
a bro journalist at the time and so we

688
00:35:42,569 --> 00:35:43,970
built it to be very lean

689
00:35:43,970 --> 00:35:48,940
and can last a long time because we
started four and a half years ago in

690
00:35:48,940 --> 00:35:52,849
we have requests there for years old at
this point still pending and

691
00:35:52,849 --> 00:35:56,260
in mike has had request going back a
decade

692
00:35:56,260 --> 00:35:59,930
other deals ordered there's one that's
an appeal that was started in 1998 and

693
00:35:59,930 --> 00:36:00,680
there's one that's

694
00:36:00,680 --> 00:36:04,520
still in its first part in from 2002 so

695
00:36:04,520 --> 00:36:07,180
yeah they sometimes they hang around
awhile but that's the exception that's

696
00:36:07,180 --> 00:36:07,569
not

697
00:36:07,569 --> 00:36:10,760
that's not what you should necessarily
expect specially today agencies have to

698
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:12,369
publish now their top 10

699
00:36:12,369 --> 00:36:15,369
oldest request nets or keep them aware
of

700
00:36:15,369 --> 00:36:18,990
the on the backlog that they face
sometimes a searchable that under for a

701
00:36:18,990 --> 00:36:20,440
while and it got lost

702
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:24,260
arm but so are number one feature is
always being around we've been

703
00:36:24,260 --> 00:36:26,830
threatened with jail we've been through
in with lawsuits we've been through in

704
00:36:26,830 --> 00:36:28,400
with Beyonce

705
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:31,510
on in all these other things up

706
00:36:31,510 --> 00:36:35,700
long story arm and you know it's our
number one features

707
00:36:35,700 --> 00:36:40,230
just stick around a but I think after
that we've we've got a a mobile site

708
00:36:40,230 --> 00:36:43,430
on coming up that we're really excited
about on

709
00:36:43,430 --> 00:36:47,670
and then our big features a leading
people clone other requests while things

710
00:36:47,670 --> 00:36:50,220
are Mazen users have done is sorta say

711
00:36:50,220 --> 00:36:53,279
hey you file this really interesting
request in this city

712
00:36:53,279 --> 00:36:56,560
a I think you'll be really amazing to
file another city in so you wanna make

713
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:57,670
that easier

714
00:36:57,670 --> 00:37:00,920
on and then analysis I mean I'm I E

715
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:04,250
I think boy is a wonderful tool and I
i've become obsessed with over the past

716
00:37:04,250 --> 00:37:05,470
four years but

717
00:37:05,470 --> 00:37:08,560
to me is only interesting because of
what you can do with it

718
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:12,279
the foil law itself no offense to any
wonderful for lawyers in the audience

719
00:37:12,279 --> 00:37:16,560
doesn't really interest me beyond how it
gets me the documents I want so

720
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:19,940
are we're really looking at ways to help
our users

721
00:37:19,940 --> 00:37:24,099
on earth interesting documents and share
those with the world and analyze them

722
00:37:24,099 --> 00:37:27,450
so when you get a seven hundred-page or
seven thousand-page document

723
00:37:27,450 --> 00:37:30,859
make it easier for people to understand
what's in it the thing that's amazing to

724
00:37:30,859 --> 00:37:32,240
me is when I look at the

725
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:35,849
mache rocks eight how the there's a huge
amount

726
00:37:35,849 --> 00:37:39,520
material they're huge and it most if it
hasn't been

727
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:43,339
examined very carefully by anybody I
think it it done would benefit from a

728
00:37:43,339 --> 00:37:44,760
better search engine and better

729
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:48,200
availability of materials so my cuz's
work cut out for

730
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:53,279
yeah if you want to build

731
00:37:53,279 --> 00:37:57,290
yeah at my question relates expected it
to the amount of

732
00:37:57,290 --> 00:38:00,580
from to the amount of documents you
might

733
00:38:00,580 --> 00:38:03,660
received from request and at that it is

734
00:38:03,660 --> 00:38:07,880
very difficult to make sense of it and I
it got hooked up on the story is told

735
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:09,359
about this

736
00:38:09,359 --> 00:38:13,230
crazy secret FBI room and it was a.m.

737
00:38:13,230 --> 00:38:18,119
to and then Mechanical Turk was used to
make sense of this documents

738
00:38:18,119 --> 00:38:22,849
and I wonder how often this happens
because two meters sounds like a very

739
00:38:22,849 --> 00:38:26,720
weird story ethically when I think that
mechanic

740
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:32,200
talk workers who might be I don't know
sitting in an internet cafe in Pakistan

741
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:35,819
and helping us to execute

742
00:38:35,819 --> 00:38:39,549
our luxurious first well political
rights

743
00:38:39,549 --> 00:38:42,670
on so I'm interested in that

744
00:38:42,670 --> 00:38:46,849
in in that point how this can be made to
or how you see this relation I think

745
00:38:46,849 --> 00:38:50,190
that example was an extraordinary
example I haven't heard that being used

746
00:38:50,190 --> 00:38:52,049
for any other for work although there
may be

747
00:38:52,049 --> 00:38:55,859
reporters who have tried it but I I
doubt tonight ProPublica properties

748
00:38:55,859 --> 00:38:57,190
Mechanical Turk Alana

749
00:38:57,190 --> 00:39:00,710
know they do I i think that the emphasis
has been on electronic

750
00:39:00,710 --> 00:39:04,650
a digital solutions OC are in better
data mining and when I went to a

751
00:39:04,650 --> 00:39:08,740
I N National Institutes a
computer-assisted reporting conference

752
00:39:08,740 --> 00:39:11,589
there's all these reporters there
working with this kinda exact problem

753
00:39:11,589 --> 00:39:12,190
and they were

754
00:39:12,190 --> 00:39:14,810
talking about somebody's électronique
tools that were out there in their

755
00:39:14,810 --> 00:39:16,670
remarkable absolute remarkable

756
00:39:16,670 --> 00:39:20,080
so I think the Mechanical Turk was just
an interim solution for one particular

757
00:39:20,080 --> 00:39:22,549
case which was very difficult to use

758
00:39:22,549 --> 00:39:26,410
abut in in in the whole I think that the
idea is to arm

759
00:39:26,410 --> 00:39:31,230
to to persuade agencies to provide
records in a more useful format

760
00:39:31,230 --> 00:39:34,750
in electronic formats that they
themselves use and so it easier for them

761
00:39:34,750 --> 00:39:36,470
to provide it easier to use them

762
00:39:36,470 --> 00:39:39,990
for whatever purpose money is important

763
00:39:39,990 --> 00:39:43,580
I'm just be a US citizen to file
requests and you have to be resident in

764
00:39:43,580 --> 00:39:45,029
the US

765
00:39:45,029 --> 00:39:50,140
no but some states require you be a
citizen in that state if you're found

766
00:39:50,140 --> 00:39:51,819
state or local request

767
00:39:51,819 --> 00:39:55,200
there there was recently a big fight
over some states who have that in their

768
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:57,799
law which says you have to be a citizen
in that statement

769
00:39:57,799 --> 00:40:01,270
residing in that state to use it they
had an exception for some journalists

770
00:40:01,270 --> 00:40:04,310
was a big fight when all the way up i
think is think there was a Supreme Court

771
00:40:04,310 --> 00:40:07,630
and the Supreme Court said yep they can
insist that you be a resident of that

772
00:40:07,630 --> 00:40:10,670
state I think it was a very poor
decision but but that's what it was

773
00:40:10,670 --> 00:40:13,770
in the US for the federal law a that may
change

774
00:40:13,770 --> 00:40:16,670
NP please proxies by the way it's not
hard to find someone who will file a

775
00:40:16,670 --> 00:40:19,089
request for you in that state just an
annoyance

776
00:40:19,089 --> 00:40:23,069
if you arm for the federal law you can
follow request anybody in the world can

777
00:40:23,069 --> 00:40:25,240
follow request but if they think you're
a %uh

778
00:40:25,240 --> 00:40:28,260
asking from a farm as a representative a
foreign government

779
00:40:28,260 --> 00:40:31,650
or you're a fugitive they will refuse
the request

780
00:40:31,650 --> 00:40:34,790
and you may have to prove that you're
not a fugitive or

781
00:40:34,790 --> 00:40:38,960
foreign intelligence person foreign
foreign government

782
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:43,330
agent representative but those are few
and far between generally agencies do

783
00:40:43,330 --> 00:40:45,779
respond to requests from non-citizens
and

784
00:40:45,779 --> 00:40:48,810
and people in other places

785
00:40:48,810 --> 00:40:52,020
yeah a we've will you one other big
things we've

786
00:40:52,020 --> 00:40:55,200
mock rock mineral pass call 23 years is

787
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:59,250
is building a proxy network on because
like Virginia and Tennessee are very

788
00:40:59,250 --> 00:41:00,170
much

789
00:41:00,170 --> 00:41:03,650
against outsiders and there will be in
their affairs

790
00:41:03,650 --> 00:41:08,190
by you know if you if if they throw red
tape you can always find more red tape a

791
00:41:08,190 --> 00:41:10,190
throw back at them and they usually back
down

792
00:41:10,190 --> 00:41:13,750
as they wanna get home and watch
jeopardy I know we're gonna talk

793
00:41:13,750 --> 00:41:17,339
have I know we're gonna talk about
details on how to strategize with way

794
00:41:17,339 --> 00:41:17,920
later

795
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:21,180
but I want to mention one thing that's
very interesting Cal mcclanahan mention

796
00:41:21,180 --> 00:41:22,170
this before as well

797
00:41:22,170 --> 00:41:26,359
i has has mention this in the past is
that when agency comes back in redox a

798
00:41:26,359 --> 00:41:28,930
whole buncha stuff and says
non-responsive that means they don't

799
00:41:28,930 --> 00:41:31,480
wanna provide a reason they don't give
it they just think it's not really

800
00:41:31,480 --> 00:41:34,049
relevant your request that they took the
time to block it out

801
00:41:34,049 --> 00:41:37,279
within the pages they're giving you
people come back and asked for all the

802
00:41:37,279 --> 00:41:38,880
non responsive material

803
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:42,299
and that works too serves to get you
everything you want

804
00:41:42,299 --> 00:41:45,779
so their strategies you can use to get
around some of the agency hurdles

805
00:41:45,779 --> 00:41:51,660
yeah a just one little quick plug we
have mock rock as an API that nobody's

806
00:41:51,660 --> 00:41:52,830
use besides us

807
00:41:52,830 --> 00:41:56,670
and if anybody's interested in mass
downloader plane with a huge

808
00:41:56,670 --> 00:42:00,960
for your datacenter just agency dataset
get in touch with us and it's

809
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:04,630
free and %um have to have an account
user

810
00:42:04,630 --> 00:42:09,240
live it should be I

811
00:42:09,240 --> 00:42:13,710
so I I was wearing at their categories
love responses that designate the

812
00:42:13,710 --> 00:42:15,549
unavailability of documents

813
00:42:15,549 --> 00:42:19,410
like and specifically to have to tell
you that something exists or not

814
00:42:19,410 --> 00:42:22,859
if you're asking for a big a

815
00:42:22,859 --> 00:42:26,430
his Reformation well that's a good
question a lot of times the thing that

816
00:42:26,430 --> 00:42:30,009
keeps people from asking for certain
records as they don't know it exists in

817
00:42:30,009 --> 00:42:34,380
agency isn't necessarily inclined to
make a proactive effort to let people

818
00:42:34,380 --> 00:42:38,270
know about that date or what format it
exists or what records exist

819
00:42:38,270 --> 00:42:41,630
the FBI has something interesting called
special locate if they can't find a file

820
00:42:41,630 --> 00:42:44,460
on your system they have lots and lots
of files in the things they can't find

821
00:42:44,460 --> 00:42:44,960
sometimes

822
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:48,150
this they come back and they say they
put it on special locate someone once

823
00:42:48,150 --> 00:42:50,330
asked for a list of all special look at
bosnia

824
00:42:50,330 --> 00:42:53,350
guy said they had no such record so I
don't quite understand that

825
00:42:53,350 --> 00:42:56,940
but but other the

826
00:42:56,940 --> 00:43:00,230
I love my cousin data

827
00:43:00,230 --> 00:43:04,259
scientists %uh I think that

828
00:43:04,259 --> 00:43:07,910
it's hard to ask the agency whether it
has records are not

829
00:43:07,910 --> 00:43:11,520
you can ask them where they have records
are not answer but they will basically

830
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:15,239
declined to answer questions because
that's not what the purpose lawyers and

831
00:43:15,239 --> 00:43:16,880
they're very picky about that and I'm

832
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:20,200
yeah I would just say there's there's so
many resources

833
00:43:20,200 --> 00:43:24,069
government had a looking through they
have we logs for so many agencies

834
00:43:24,069 --> 00:43:27,720
among brokers almost half a million
pages at this point

835
00:43:27,720 --> 00:43:31,819
a document cloud is another website and
sometimes before I follow request

836
00:43:31,819 --> 00:43:35,460
I just search on their and I look for
what forms agencies use

837
00:43:35,460 --> 00:43:39,560
and I find something that's related or
maybe the cousin of the document I want

838
00:43:39,560 --> 00:43:43,630
arm in points to enter retain certain
regulatory filings

839
00:43:43,630 --> 00:43:47,799
is a really good waves or a corner in an
insane are we don't have any reports on

840
00:43:47,799 --> 00:43:48,770
this essay will

841
00:43:48,770 --> 00:43:52,700
by congress Congress mandates are you
have a report on this and then no delay

842
00:43:52,700 --> 00:43:57,250
well we do the foyer the agency way
officers would like us to probably say

843
00:43:57,250 --> 00:43:58,180
that they each

844
00:43:58,180 --> 00:44:01,150
agency in the federal government has a
fully a publicly is on his job is to

845
00:44:01,150 --> 00:44:03,850
answer questions are the sort and you
can call them up and you can see I'm

846
00:44:03,850 --> 00:44:07,180
interested in asking for something along
these lines do you guys had this kind of

847
00:44:07,180 --> 00:44:07,520
thing

848
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:10,819
and you know it can hurt sometimes it
can up most the time

849
00:44:10,819 --> 00:44:14,440
useful to ask that kind of question can

850
00:44:14,440 --> 00:44:18,869
a have you ever had any luck getting
information from the NYPD

851
00:44:18,869 --> 00:44:21,930
I are we we

852
00:44:21,930 --> 00:44:26,060
yet we've we've gotten we recently got
therefore will guide after they claim is

853
00:44:26,060 --> 00:44:26,529
Sean

854
00:44:26,529 --> 00:44:31,950
the room um so yeah we've we filed a lot
with NYPD they are

855
00:44:31,950 --> 00:44:35,690
police departments when your time local
level %uh police departments

856
00:44:35,690 --> 00:44:38,960
are pretty much the worst arm as far as
transparency goes

857
00:44:38,960 --> 00:44:42,759
third-grade a lotta ways but they're the
worst and transparency arm

858
00:44:42,759 --> 00:44:47,640
and NYPD is the worst of the worst when
it comes to transparency

859
00:44:47,640 --> 00:44:52,529
in that respect on tell about the voyeur
voyeur guy that yeah but we

860
00:44:52,529 --> 00:44:55,680
we we filed a request further for your
guide because they just

861
00:44:55,680 --> 00:44:59,369
were given us anything and so he said
okay give the help us understand how

862
00:44:59,369 --> 00:45:01,600
you're not able to do your job

863
00:45:01,600 --> 00:45:04,680
on and they said well we don't have a
four-year guide and then

864
00:45:04,680 --> 00:45:07,950
another request got there for a
patroller their Patrolmen's

865
00:45:07,950 --> 00:45:11,770
on guidebook where they actually somehow
I think they had

866
00:45:11,770 --> 00:45:15,940
somebody else in soon got it and we
filed over class for an updated one in

867
00:45:15,940 --> 00:45:18,170
pointed out the day at least the old one

868
00:45:18,170 --> 00:45:22,279
in the updated one it had therefore to
God in the middle this other guy

869
00:45:22,279 --> 00:45:25,839
on and one other across the Fylde was

870
00:45:25,839 --> 00:45:29,279
a lot above records retention schedules
each state

871
00:45:29,279 --> 00:45:32,420
allotted agencies have a records
retention schedule

872
00:45:32,420 --> 00:45:36,589
which is these are the documents we have
these are who is in charge of them

873
00:45:36,589 --> 00:45:39,549
these are how long we have to keep them
all and those are a great resource

874
00:45:39,549 --> 00:45:42,330
because then when an agency says we
don't have tax

875
00:45:42,330 --> 00:45:46,160
we say will your records retention
schedule says you have X

876
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:49,930
and says you have to keep it for six
years some 16 years worth of tax

877
00:45:49,930 --> 00:45:55,529
on and dad has been very helpful in
getting NYPD to slowly push back

878
00:45:55,529 --> 00:45:58,730
arm but there's a lot of people on the
lawyers are very happy to

879
00:45:58,730 --> 00:46:02,720
discuss pro bono suing NYPD just as they
have such a terrible record

880
00:46:02,720 --> 00:46:05,920
arm but if you each agency

881
00:46:05,920 --> 00:46:09,690
that we've filed with has a world on

882
00:46:09,690 --> 00:46:13,790
a page on our website and so you can see
where we've been successful where we

883
00:46:13,790 --> 00:46:15,200
have been successful

884
00:46:15,200 --> 00:46:18,190
arm but I think starting with the
records retention schedule starting with

885
00:46:18,190 --> 00:46:19,220
the foyer guide

886
00:46:19,220 --> 00:46:22,810
arm it was a really amazing document we
got there kinda

887
00:46:22,810 --> 00:46:26,739
detailed every single type a document we
had and they gave us a lot more

888
00:46:26,739 --> 00:46:30,339
on darn help getting anything out of
them

889
00:46:30,339 --> 00:46:34,109
the other records retention schedule I
can't stress how how valuable how golden

890
00:46:34,109 --> 00:46:37,589
that is as a tool to figure out what to
ask for because it gives you the

891
00:46:37,589 --> 00:46:41,970
entire records set up the agency in in
general category sometimes quite

892
00:46:41,970 --> 00:46:43,790
detailed on how long the key been one

893
00:46:43,790 --> 00:46:48,869
where it is and who met administers it
in fact the National Archives quietly

894
00:46:48,869 --> 00:46:51,950
about a year ago I guess they just
published online: the records retention

895
00:46:51,950 --> 00:46:54,319
schedules going back decades have all
the acre

896
00:46:54,319 --> 00:46:58,239
all the federal agencies and is really a
a road map to the entire record keeping

897
00:46:58,239 --> 00:46:59,660
system is quite useful

898
00:46:59,660 --> 00:47:02,989
as a guide NYPD's interesting also in
them

899
00:47:02,989 --> 00:47:06,130
we can get on this question is what they
they created their own thing

900
00:47:06,130 --> 00:47:09,690
classification system they hired a much
sexier a people

901
00:47:09,690 --> 00:47:13,230
and the CIA people like you know in this
not the federal government classified

902
00:47:13,230 --> 00:47:14,009
documents

903
00:47:14,009 --> 00:47:17,420
and so they made up like this stamp they
just bought a stamp that sent secret

904
00:47:17,420 --> 00:47:18,690
started stepping stone

905
00:47:18,690 --> 00:47:21,700
was no legal backing behind this there's
no

906
00:47:21,700 --> 00:47:24,810
state classification system it is for
the class fines

907
00:47:24,810 --> 00:47:29,600
saw in a knows very frustrating in
amusing when they started

908
00:47:29,600 --> 00:47:32,670
insane are you can we can release dates
class what you talking about

909
00:47:32,670 --> 00:47:36,000
that's not a good thing for you so gotta
be careful

910
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:39,299
but then guide getting documentation on
how it is made this process up

911
00:47:39,299 --> 00:47:43,680
the news said thanks to the snow mix we
have

912
00:47:43,680 --> 00:47:46,569
a lot of classified records alotta
detailed information is classified

913
00:47:46,569 --> 00:47:47,609
programs

914
00:47:47,609 --> 00:47:51,020
and that ice in the problem for this to
me under fire

915
00:47:51,020 --> 00:47:54,980
and predators at their ways to seek the
techniques for seeking

916
00:47:54,980 --> 00:47:58,270
unclassified records a foothold in those
documents yeah and

917
00:47:58,270 --> 00:48:02,790
too good question %uh so I think they
won't talk about something like the

918
00:48:02,790 --> 00:48:03,750
drone program

919
00:48:03,750 --> 00:48:06,910
they wouldn't talk about and when they
don't when the administration doesn't

920
00:48:06,910 --> 00:48:08,569
officially acknowledge something

921
00:48:08,569 --> 00:48:11,640
it's very very difficult to get
something out of there unless you can

922
00:48:11,640 --> 00:48:12,190
prove

923
00:48:12,190 --> 00:48:16,710
unofficial publicly acknowledges program
once they start at once

924
00:48:16,710 --> 00:48:19,910
they spoke out publicly about the drone
program once they

925
00:48:19,910 --> 00:48:23,799
they created I see on the record is a
tumbler town

926
00:48:23,799 --> 00:48:27,520
that the so the the tells me runs

927
00:48:27,520 --> 00:48:30,850
and now that they've started publicly
talking about this

928
00:48:30,850 --> 00:48:34,400
that mean something was declassified in
using that I

929
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:37,839
really nicely on the record very closely
and looking at what they've released

930
00:48:37,839 --> 00:48:38,790
previously

931
00:48:38,790 --> 00:48:43,790
the FF has done a really good job keep
suing them continually for documents

932
00:48:43,790 --> 00:48:47,119
that kinda opens a window because when
they start talking about these programs

933
00:48:47,119 --> 00:48:48,140
publicly

934
00:48:48,140 --> 00:48:51,390
that means that there's at least some
material that's been declassified

935
00:48:51,390 --> 00:48:55,589
so snowden the snowed in leaks are very
useful guide book

936
00:48:55,589 --> 00:48:59,020
but if you want to file for your person
and get some traction

937
00:48:59,020 --> 00:49:02,190
I would point to what they've released
in in use that as your

938
00:49:02,190 --> 00:49:05,630
started sometimes it's good to look at
the historical record in

939
00:49:05,630 --> 00:49:09,480
and the each other the each the agency's
is published

940
00:49:09,480 --> 00:49:13,040
intelligent eases for examples polish
hundreds a historical documents

941
00:49:13,040 --> 00:49:14,589
describing what they did

942
00:49:14,589 --> 00:49:18,319
and an essay for example been quite good
as opposed to others who we will mention

943
00:49:18,319 --> 00:49:22,020
have been very good but NSA has been
excellent in releasing some of these are

944
00:49:22,020 --> 00:49:25,759
some these historical documents which
don't provide viewpoint on what the

945
00:49:25,759 --> 00:49:27,230
current situation is but they

946
00:49:27,230 --> 00:49:31,140
they give you a good window on what
happened before which is often helpful

947
00:49:31,140 --> 00:49:35,239
I think we have time for one last quick
question yeah come to the workshops I i

948
00:49:35,239 --> 00:49:36,500
have a

949
00:49:36,500 --> 00:49:39,750
two quick ones one is about NYPD

950
00:49:39,750 --> 00:49:46,230
upper at at at Wall Street protesters a
big truck there took or whatever it's

951
00:49:46,230 --> 00:49:46,750
called

952
00:49:46,750 --> 00:49:51,369
I surveilling everyone there have any of
those records been made available then

953
00:49:51,369 --> 00:49:54,810
you made a reference to having been
harassed

954
00:49:54,810 --> 00:49:58,720
a threatened with lawsuits and some sort
have

955
00:49:58,720 --> 00:50:02,450
fiance reference so wonder if you could
clarify that

956
00:50:02,450 --> 00:50:05,739
yes 0 there's been a lot a good lawsuits
briefly i

957
00:50:05,739 --> 00:50:09,130
we've gotten some Seattle Occupy Seattle
documents

958
00:50:09,130 --> 00:50:13,619
our users have a and there's been a lot
of lawsuits against NYPD for

959
00:50:13,619 --> 00:50:16,690
or occupy and all Street documents

960
00:50:16,690 --> 00:50:20,250
so yes there's been some stuff for least
I think a lot of stuff police

961
00:50:20,250 --> 00:50:24,310
I think there's probably a lot more
stuff that hasn't been released by on

962
00:50:24,310 --> 00:50:28,160
law that had to be sued over on and as
far as Beyonce

963
00:50:28,160 --> 00:50:32,680
so when Obama was inaugurated for the
second time the second inauguration

964
00:50:32,680 --> 00:50:36,600
are Beyonce performed and we filed a
request for

965
00:50:36,600 --> 00:50:42,080
arm her performance materials so there's
a big lip sync in controversy

966
00:50:42,080 --> 00:50:46,430
a where and we said well it was lip sync
that means they had been recording

967
00:50:46,430 --> 00:50:49,480
that was done by the marine band which
is the US Agency

968
00:50:49,480 --> 00:50:53,830
and so we got a bunch of tracks from the
Marine Corps band not actually including

969
00:50:53,830 --> 00:50:54,580
Beyonce

970
00:50:54,580 --> 00:50:59,500
a so a lot of the Beyonce apparently is
not subject to flow in any capacity

971
00:50:59,500 --> 00:51:04,150
on and which was weird because I kept
reading them I get why are they giving

972
00:51:04,150 --> 00:51:07,730
it was recorded by the Marine Corps band
but they said no but will give you these

973
00:51:07,730 --> 00:51:08,549
other sins

974
00:51:08,549 --> 00:51:11,560
documents but if you post them it was on

975
00:51:11,560 --> 00:51:16,810
score composed by John Williams and the
music was performed by the marines

976
00:51:16,810 --> 00:51:20,670
but the musical arrangement was under
copyright

977
00:51:20,670 --> 00:51:23,869
they said we'll give it to you and you
can listen to it all you want but if you

978
00:51:23,869 --> 00:51:26,430
post this on your website the John
Williams a state

979
00:51:26,430 --> 00:51:29,710
will likely see your business are not a
state since he's alive

980
00:51:29,710 --> 00:51:34,029
J thank you thank you all very much well
