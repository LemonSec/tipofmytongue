stage but I think I can you dance
microphone

27
00:02:08,619 --> 00:02:12,350
I wanna start out by saying to dan
ellsberg

28
00:02:12,350 --> 00:02:16,210
thank you for everything you've done for
all your service both

29
00:02:16,210 --> 00:02:20,400
in the government and outside government
everything you did for us

30
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:23,610
as a nation as a society you have given

31
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:27,590
us you have given so many so much and
told us the truth

32
00:02:27,590 --> 00:02:32,450
about what our government is doing at a
time when the truth is very hard to get

33
00:02:32,450 --> 00:02:36,760
and I have to say I i actually out

34
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:41,520
I watched a documentary about your life
as I was grappling with these issues

35
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:42,370
myself

36
00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:46,270
and deter had a deep impact

37
00:02:46,270 --> 00:02:53,270
really shaped my paintings to thank you
for everything

38
00:02:58,069 --> 00:03:01,860
head to I see you've changed since I
last saw you

39
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:04,860
hike I have to tell you

40
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:11,599
you don't have to do that for this
audience the well luckily I've

41
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:17,340
I've got plenty black t-shirts but I do
not have to keep Alexander granddad G

42
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:22,110
I'll say this for Def Con

43
00:03:22,110 --> 00:03:25,680
so

44
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:30,849
up I'm gonna try to stay largely on the
way and that these guys cock but I think

45
00:03:30,849 --> 00:03:31,879
there's a few

46
00:03:31,879 --> 00:03:35,769
topics said would like to cover and

47
00:03:35,769 --> 00:03:39,280
to start with I was hoping dan could
describe

48
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:43,349
on when it felt like the first time you
heard about Edward snowden

49
00:03:43,349 --> 00:03:47,420
on his feelings on hearing his name

50
00:03:47,420 --> 00:03:50,989
and seeing what he had given the world's
and

51
00:03:50,989 --> 00:03:54,000
if his feelings have changed since then
and how he's

52
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,019
he's grown to feel about everson

53
00:03:57,019 --> 00:04:00,540
I can tell you exactly what I shall

54
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:05,169
hope actually which had not been

55
00:04:05,169 --> 00:04:08,780
great supply for me recently when I saw
this

56
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:12,169
name in this conference I had mixed
feelings about it

57
00:04:12,169 --> 00:04:15,840
I'll my my feelings of hope

58
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:20,060
go up and down or I haven't been too
high and no question

59
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:23,210
I'll I felt though when cell

60
00:04:23,210 --> 00:04:26,919
when Chelsea Manning was revealed I use
to

61
00:04:26,919 --> 00:04:31,630
night you says Conway how how often do
you need a pentagon papers which is a

62
00:04:31,630 --> 00:04:32,560
massive

63
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:36,440
disclosure that is unequivocal documents

64
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:40,440
that really shows in one document
doesn't do it as as it knows

65
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:43,729
and mando they can say well we change
that

66
00:04:43,729 --> 00:04:48,639
the next day that was just some
particular on a little Department

67
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:53,590
some low-level person originators from
so what you really need is a massive

68
00:04:53,590 --> 00:04:55,240
stuff as in the pentagon papers

69
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:58,800
the chose know this is what they said
the next day and the day after that near

70
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,000
was the official policy

71
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,169
and so forth and I waited forty years

72
00:05:03,169 --> 00:05:08,150
to hear that and so I was pretty much
losing hope that there would be anybody

73
00:05:08,150 --> 00:05:08,770
inside

74
00:05:08,770 --> 00:05:11,979
who was willing to risk

75
00:05:11,979 --> 00:05:15,400
his freedom his life for her life

76
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:20,250
freedom to put out what needed to be put
out because I if you put on a lot of

77
00:05:20,250 --> 00:05:20,789
stuff

78
00:05:20,789 --> 00:05:24,240
and I want to get into this with you ed
its technically

79
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:27,659
you have to be something a specialist to
put on a lot of stuff com

80
00:05:27,659 --> 00:05:33,270
not be identified shell I was feeling
not hopeful it'll come in just three

81
00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:34,550
years after Manning

82
00:05:34,550 --> 00:05:38,270
come snow themselves no question I
thought it is possible

83
00:05:38,270 --> 00:05:42,780
and a in fact I N you once told me

84
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:46,960
that I you hoped among other things to
show

85
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:50,310
that one could do this and be successful

86
00:05:50,310 --> 00:05:53,860
and i i'd be interested to hear actually
from you

87
00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:57,479
watcher measure I there's no question in
my mind you have been successful

88
00:05:57,479 --> 00:06:00,690
but what you had in mind when you wanted
to show that people could do this

89
00:06:00,690 --> 00:06:04,650
because after all you are on the country
et cetera well

90
00:06:04,650 --> 00:06:07,870
so then there's a lot of things to
address that I mean that that's a big

91
00:06:07,870 --> 00:06:10,029
topic but you said something I want to

92
00:06:10,029 --> 00:06:15,070
response you first which was you kinda
touched on technology you talked about

93
00:06:15,070 --> 00:06:16,479
how people recently

94
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:20,159
RR specialists there you specialist
skills

95
00:06:20,159 --> 00:06:23,680
together information is tremendously
important to the public but we've been

96
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:24,669
denied access

97
00:06:24,669 --> 00:06:28,159
to and they're able to publish that
getting around the world

98
00:06:28,159 --> 00:06:32,180
arm before anyone's able to stop before
their original story

99
00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:35,469
before they're able to basically shot
public

100
00:06:35,469 --> 00:06:39,760
out are the room government you know
this one died or sauce from our

101
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:43,180
democracy and the keep me there

102
00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:47,120
is that up technology

103
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:51,520
empowers this is something we seen again
and again people forget yes

104
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:54,639
because they think about only modern
times the only weathered the recent

105
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:57,639
samples I think about meeting meaning
now

106
00:06:57,639 --> 00:07:01,520
other people who all in the same sort
for but they forget the technology

107
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:02,010
actually

108
00:07:02,010 --> 00:07:05,270
in a few people forget about the snack
that

109
00:07:05,270 --> 00:07:08,300
you were you know you know in a garage
with Xerox

110
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:11,729
she you know a copy machine might not
seem like a killer app to a lot of

111
00:07:11,729 --> 00:07:12,200
people

112
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:15,840
with that enable you get this back to
the pool

113
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:18,940
and the same xerox machine negating that
gave us

114
00:07:18,940 --> 00:07:23,139
same is done in the the former associate
why and

115
00:07:23,139 --> 00:07:27,870
what that tells me and what i think is
important for our society

116
00:07:27,870 --> 00:07:31,910
and I don't just mean I mean around the
world is to recognize

117
00:07:31,910 --> 00:07:35,319
the technology empowers individuals

118
00:07:35,319 --> 00:07:40,229
it empowers Boysen how's democracy in we
didn't earn $1 million into a movie

119
00:07:40,229 --> 00:07:45,979
or a woman into world more in as
fundamentally change the way that we

120
00:07:45,979 --> 00:07:47,520
relate to our government

121
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:50,550
and more importantly the way our
government relates to

122
00:07:50,550 --> 00:07:54,590
us you know they say when people feared

123
00:07:54,590 --> 00:07:57,590
when the government fears people we mobs

124
00:07:57,590 --> 00:08:00,639
we have new we have freedom and I think
that's very true

125
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:04,180
and we see that more MORE when the
government has been

126
00:08:04,180 --> 00:08:08,000
left Sweden doc even when we have
whistleblowers

127
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,530
who come up and see the great interest
to bring things public

128
00:08:11,530 --> 00:08:15,139
are people like will be times through

129
00:08:15,139 --> 00:08:18,199
arm at Loomis I'll

130
00:08:18,199 --> 00:08:21,690
who end up giving you know these guys
get pole out of the shower naked at

131
00:08:21,690 --> 00:08:22,280
gunpoint

132
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:25,340
from the things their lives who is

133
00:08:25,340 --> 00:08:29,069
their discredited you know he said
disgruntled

134
00:08:29,069 --> 00:08:32,169
there's these these broad campaigns
brought against them it

135
00:08:32,169 --> 00:08:35,430
they didn't hands heart evidence

136
00:08:35,430 --> 00:08:38,979
they did everything right thing
witnesses in this industry bear

137
00:08:38,979 --> 00:08:43,250
mishap again something very important
happened

138
00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:47,290
are a lot of people haven't seen washing
hostesses anymore

139
00:08:47,290 --> 00:08:50,550
are I former State Department official
who

140
00:08:50,550 --> 00:08:55,500
has basically said I'm he's bound by
classification he had to get the

141
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:59,870
articles ruled by government to redact
any classified information

142
00:08:59,870 --> 00:09:03,430
were deposited with the washington post
lani basically said

143
00:09:03,430 --> 00:09:06,630
executive order 12 triple which is one
of the sons

144
00:09:06,630 --> 00:09:10,120
Ortiz which allows the United States
intercept basically

145
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:13,790
communications the current overseas is
being used

146
00:09:13,790 --> 00:09:18,490
to collect incredible a mouse a
communications not just on people around

147
00:09:18,490 --> 00:09:20,459
the world not just listens everywhere

148
00:09:20,459 --> 00:09:23,980
it specifically on Americans which is
precisely with United States government

149
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:27,360
said

150
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:30,790
and this is this is the kind of thing
that's dates

151
00:09:30,790 --> 00:09:34,790
illustrated because what he revealed was
explosive

152
00:09:34,790 --> 00:09:38,100
should be on the front page of every
newspaper but instead it's an opinion

153
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:39,050
article

154
00:09:39,050 --> 00:09:42,569
on one newspaper because there's not
clear irrefutable

155
00:09:42,569 --> 00:09:46,100
evidence that brings the president to
the whole brings

156
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:49,670
the Congress to you know the press and
says

157
00:09:49,670 --> 00:09:53,959
we have to have a national conversation
where the public is given back

158
00:09:53,959 --> 00:09:57,420
it see stable government and we as a
society

159
00:09:57,420 --> 00:10:01,209
are given the opportunity site where the
lines should be drawn

160
00:10:01,209 --> 00:10:04,870
not a few officials are sitting behind
closed doors and I think that

161
00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:07,900
is a new power

162
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:11,240
the technology has given us over the
last 100 years

163
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:14,770
that is increasing in frequency straight
man to

164
00:10:14,770 --> 00:10:19,730
and if we paint with

165
00:10:19,730 --> 00:10:23,280
with and responsibility to use
appropriately to

166
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:26,780
police ourselves the way our technology
grows and not sleep

167
00:10:26,780 --> 00:10:31,550
law into new protocols into the usages
into new applications for these things

168
00:10:31,550 --> 00:10:36,060
we really think about the implications
output in you know our cities in our

169
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:39,800
your sneakers and washing machines and
you buy at the grocery store

170
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:43,439
we will have not dystopian future but
we'll

171
00:10:43,439 --> 00:10:46,930
am a democracy in which citizens

172
00:10:46,930 --> 00:10:51,380
around the world in every country are in
power regardless the policies and their

173
00:10:51,380 --> 00:10:53,640
government and we at the very minimum

174
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:56,650
will know the truth about world in the
truth our government and it will not be

175
00:10:56,650 --> 00:11:03,650
able to be hidden from us and more

176
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:11,399
on so add you mentioned

177
00:11:11,399 --> 00:11:14,700
to SA whistleblowers who came before you
Thomas trackers in the front row here

178
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:19,149
and a bill Binnie who spoke at the lil
last hope two years ago

179
00:11:19,149 --> 00:11:23,410
on and of course on here since daniel
ellsberg most

180
00:11:23,410 --> 00:11:27,589
famous whistleblower in US history were
you aware of their stories

181
00:11:27,589 --> 00:11:31,640
I am prior on to what you did on how
familiar

182
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:35,300
were you with the pentagon papers and
dan ellsberg

183
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:38,470
and did you learn any lessons from them

184
00:11:38,470 --> 00:11:41,959
and are there lessons future
whistleblowers can can learn from you

185
00:11:41,959 --> 00:11:45,010
I absolutely i mean i

186
00:11:45,010 --> 00:11:48,670
I follow this closely I think every in
the towns can you did because we're

187
00:11:48,670 --> 00:11:49,800
people forget

188
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:54,140
is that you know we in public we see the
stories they come on the news you know I

189
00:11:54,140 --> 00:11:58,230
the Justice Department president all
talking heads they say these guys and

190
00:11:58,230 --> 00:11:59,209
bad guys this

191
00:11:59,209 --> 00:12:03,779
wrist country this you know spies have
been charging the Espionage Act a

192
00:12:03,779 --> 00:12:08,100
a they did that when you wouldn't happen
when you look bad

193
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:11,480
the government to used in their case
particularly as Thomas true

194
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:15,220
which eventually collapse I and the drop
Jack John

195
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:19,560
and basically agreed to call it a day
are

196
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:23,660
you gotta remember that inside the
intelligence community trumpet

197
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:27,529
these things they're holding these guys
up at as examples to say look

198
00:12:27,529 --> 00:12:30,560
if you say what's going on stuff online

199
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:34,350
even years even if you doing it for the
right reasons even if you do it the

200
00:12:34,350 --> 00:12:35,060
right call

201
00:12:35,060 --> 00:12:40,360
there will be Rep russians know they
they talk about internal channels mama

202
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:43,450
these guys used intern chance and they

203
00:12:43,450 --> 00:12:47,829
people like thomas strentz ended up
getting and I and this is something that

204
00:12:47,829 --> 00:12:48,320
I

205
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:52,420
paid very close attention I'm a great
deal on and I think

206
00:12:52,420 --> 00:12:56,529
it reminds us that you know that the
founding fathers they didn't

207
00:12:56,529 --> 00:12:59,529
height a revolution have a right to

208
00:12:59,529 --> 00:13:05,270
sort by internal process the Supreme
Court this you know some internal secret

209
00:13:05,270 --> 00:13:06,029
policy

210
00:13:06,029 --> 00:13:09,250
is not democracy and that's not checks
and bans

211
00:13:09,250 --> 00:13:12,350
thats your person if we're gonna have
the Moxie

212
00:13:12,350 --> 00:13:16,270
we're gonna have and right enlightened
citizens if we're going to be able to

213
00:13:16,270 --> 00:13:17,250
action baugh

214
00:13:17,250 --> 00:13:22,980
that you know consent the car we have to
know what song has not least the broad

215
00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:24,150
outlines the Parsons

216
00:13:24,150 --> 00:13:28,329
and we can't have the government shut us
now from every action

217
00:13:28,329 --> 00:13:31,480
you know that they do now that doesn't
mean you need to know the name

218
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:34,760
every single spring it's hard it's out
there and detailed

219
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:38,360
every particular operation against
factory and more

220
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:42,120
we have he front as americans

221
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:45,970
and members of the global no the broad
outlines a

222
00:13:45,970 --> 00:13:49,170
on policies that have a significant
impact on our lives

223
00:13:49,170 --> 00:13:56,170
and I think that's something that the
Tom direction have dude

224
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:07,100
so damn i text questions for you on

225
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:11,040
oftentimes I its biggest critics

226
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:14,380
often invoke your name and

227
00:14:14,380 --> 00:14:18,020
they invoke it in a positive way and try
to contrast what you did

228
00:14:18,020 --> 00:14:22,110
with whatever did but can you talk about
that a little bit how does that make you

229
00:14:22,110 --> 00:14:22,780
feel

230
00:14:22,780 --> 00:14:26,040
and you agree with and you disagree with
them to the most recent was actually

231
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:27,830
Secretary of State John Kerry

232
00:14:27,830 --> 00:14:32,710
who said that that you are a hero but hi
ed was

233
00:14:32,710 --> 00:14:36,120
was not and sell you spend on elder

234
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:39,710
well this bullshit in a way started with

235
00:14:39,710 --> 00:14:43,230
like Obama I'll ran

236
00:14:43,230 --> 00:14:47,300
somebody actually took the occasion to
ask him about Manning

237
00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:50,540
I N here in San Francisco concede here

238
00:14:50,540 --> 00:14:53,900
country and San Francisco I and said
Well

239
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:58,450
didn't Chelsea Manning them Bradley do
exactly what else for did

240
00:14:58,450 --> 00:15:03,810
you know and with with well I could
answer that very strange what he said

241
00:15:03,810 --> 00:15:04,280
was

242
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:08,490
on ellsberg's material was classified in
a different manner

243
00:15:08,490 --> 00:15:11,570
well that was true in a way

244
00:15:11,570 --> 00:15:15,610
whatever what as I mentioned earlier
everything that Manning put I was secret

245
00:15:15,610 --> 00:15:16,530
or less

246
00:15:16,530 --> 00:15:20,950
and everything I put always top-secret
that was the difference

247
00:15:20,950 --> 00:15:25,520
and to I think the person asking the
question didn't pursue their

248
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:28,560
a and of course in your case

249
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:32,820
arm will I'll come back to that but in
your case higher than top secret you

250
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:33,110
know

251
00:15:33,110 --> 00:15:37,370
communications intelligence stuff which
I would earlier have said

252
00:15:37,370 --> 00:15:41,930
arm didn't deserve to be put out and
tell you see what it says

253
00:15:41,930 --> 00:15:45,990
and then you see it's evidence of
criminality and should not be

254
00:15:45,990 --> 00:15:51,060
subject to criminal prosecution for
revealing it even though it years

255
00:15:51,060 --> 00:15:54,770
higher than top secret so since then
that was with Manning

256
00:15:54,770 --> 00:15:59,860
and I found them 13 2010 that thanks to
Manning and now do you

257
00:15:59,860 --> 00:16:05,930
I'm getting more favorable publicity in
forty years

258
00:16:05,930 --> 00:16:09,240
forty haha because suddenly

259
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:12,540
people who we're all for putting me in
prison for life before

260
00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:15,680
now realize that I was really a very
good guy I was the

261
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:19,490
I was the good whistleblower control

262
00:16:19,490 --> 00:16:23,400
I'm I'm totally of course rejected this
from the beginning then I

263
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:28,220
didn't want to be a forreal for showing
a battery

264
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:31,470
to people that I totally admire doing on
an identified with

265
00:16:31,470 --> 00:16:35,320
because the inlets leakers
whistleblowers

266
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:38,870
and I appreciate the mall ones who put
on information that should have been on

267
00:16:38,870 --> 00:16:41,030
their anonymous I don't know their names
on the wall

268
00:16:41,030 --> 00:16:44,900
but the difference here %uh to me with

269
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:49,660
Manning and you was that each showed
very clearly

270
00:16:49,660 --> 00:16:54,650
as I had felt for years ago a
willingness to put out enough material

271
00:16:54,650 --> 00:16:58,660
that was gonna see your really be
serious but is in prison for life

272
00:16:58,660 --> 00:17:03,600
when when I read that Manning it said
relationship to agree in Lommel

273
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:07,260
the wrong guy to confide in that

274
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:11,530
he was willing to go to prison for life
or even be executed

275
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:17,110
I said to myself I have waited forty
years to hear somebody say that

276
00:17:17,110 --> 00:17:20,260
that's the way I feel forty years ago
and

277
00:17:20,260 --> 00:17:24,230
it's taken this long but so I filled
immediately and identification with him

278
00:17:24,230 --> 00:17:27,490
obviously in your case in Manning's case
in my case

279
00:17:27,490 --> 00:17:31,230
we all have different backgrounds were
different in in many ways but we have

280
00:17:31,230 --> 00:17:32,150
the same access

281
00:17:32,150 --> 00:17:35,620
interestingly not comparable comparable
and rub

282
00:17:35,620 --> 00:17:38,920
different kinds of things soul
identified

283
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:43,180
with them and I couldn't bear to hear me
getting good press

284
00:17:43,180 --> 00:17:47,080
on from the secretary saying from on
their on the grounds that

285
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:50,940
my motives were different and go for
example you mention you have some

286
00:17:50,940 --> 00:17:51,860
specific sir

287
00:17:51,860 --> 00:17:55,610
well ellsberg just put out information
that was historical

288
00:17:55,610 --> 00:17:58,710
you know are three years old at the

289
00:17:58,710 --> 00:18:02,590
at the most recent well that's because I
didn't have for most recent

290
00:18:02,590 --> 00:18:06,310
I if if I had had the current

291
00:18:06,310 --> 00:18:09,390
documents I would not have bothered to
put out history

292
00:18:09,390 --> 00:18:14,620
mine high-interest was not in setting
the record straight my interest was in

293
00:18:14,620 --> 00:18:16,340
ending an ongoing war

294
00:18:16,340 --> 00:18:20,420
helping to end an ongoing war and for
that I would much prefer

295
00:18:20,420 --> 00:18:23,620
to put out current documents which a

296
00:18:23,620 --> 00:18:27,370
at that moment didn't have access to
very few people daily in the government

297
00:18:27,370 --> 00:18:30,830
even in the white house. he was a big
secret what nixon was really up to

298
00:18:30,830 --> 00:18:33,900
including nuclear threats and I hope

299
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:38,500
that my documents would show a pattern
that extended into the present

300
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:42,960
and I failed are hardly anybody was
willing to extrapolate

301
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:47,340
and say well ellsberg shown that four
previous presidents

302
00:18:47,340 --> 00:18:50,990
live in the same way escalated in the
same way made the same kinda secret

303
00:18:50,990 --> 00:18:52,110
threats

304
00:18:52,110 --> 00:18:56,070
are truman Eisenhower Kennedy and
Johnson but it ended with those who

305
00:18:56,070 --> 00:18:57,330
attended before nixon

306
00:18:57,330 --> 00:19:01,150
so I thought maybe they'll figure out
that maybe the current president

307
00:19:01,150 --> 00:19:04,700
is doing the same Knoll it took
documents

308
00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:08,120
and I didn't have that so for years I've
been saying

309
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:12,080
to people it's gonna be with documents
even though the increases the risk

310
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:16,050
well people know that basically but they
were willing to take the risk I'm sorry

311
00:19:16,050 --> 00:19:17,040
to say

312
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:21,130
and I'm could do in announcing show them
Manning came out with his

313
00:19:21,130 --> 00:19:24,450
I'll millions haha hundreds of thousands
actually

314
00:19:24,450 --> 00:19:28,510
cables and then you with documents

315
00:19:28,510 --> 00:19:32,160
and it's like Mordechai Vanunu in Israel
with photographs

316
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:35,860
that Israel had up a nuclear program and
even an h-bomb

317
00:19:35,860 --> 00:19:39,720
that they weren't willing to admit and
it took those documents which took the

318
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:40,510
risk

319
00:19:40,510 --> 00:19:43,900
so what i'm saying is a I saw right away

320
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:47,580
without having met you without having
that Manning that

321
00:19:47,580 --> 00:19:52,030
this is someone who I identify with

322
00:19:52,030 --> 00:19:56,420
and at the same time new heroes she said
well as my feeling

323
00:19:56,420 --> 00:19:59,770
I'll heard Snowden's well I have a new
hero

324
00:19:59,770 --> 00:20:03,770
now and so thank you

325
00:20:03,770 --> 00:20:10,150
and

326
00:20:10,150 --> 00:20:13,770
providing would actually follow up on
that I think there's a really important

327
00:20:13,770 --> 00:20:17,100
want there that wasn't no hasn't been
real well

328
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:20,680
addressed and media and that was you
said you acted

329
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:24,810
you not to reveal specific in yeah but

330
00:20:24,810 --> 00:20:28,370
end the war the basically correct

331
00:20:28,370 --> 00:20:31,410
seniors policies that were costing lives

332
00:20:31,410 --> 00:20:35,490
costing us the future of our country
critical home

333
00:20:35,490 --> 00:20:39,230
work needs to be changed where we can
step back soon one

334
00:20:39,230 --> 00:20:42,900
enjoy better society and I think people
need to remember that

335
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:47,380
these these a the stories that are being
published by Jim

336
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:50,850
posts the journalists working together

337
00:20:50,850 --> 00:20:55,050
editors institutions to really analyze
whether these things

338
00:20:55,050 --> 00:20:58,070
are in public interest whether they can
benefit

339
00:20:58,070 --> 00:21:01,820
us Society tomorrow and one published
since they were just

340
00:21:01,820 --> 00:21:05,600
you know gossip or they don't have this

341
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:09,880
just haitian on with me. since the
stories

342
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:14,420
we Dean we not home Lawrence or the new
truth

343
00:21:14,420 --> 00:21:18,130
are all about the fact that I

344
00:21:18,130 --> 00:21:21,950
all over communes are being intercepted

345
00:21:21,950 --> 00:21:25,560
elected in license or automatic

346
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:28,570
and that means that all OVR years or

347
00:21:28,570 --> 00:21:33,230
of Hallmark's russians or associations
who talked to who me

348
00:21:33,230 --> 00:21:36,580
cool off we had all these things

349
00:21:36,580 --> 00:21:40,220
are not supported to the officials to
the Parsons

350
00:21:40,220 --> 00:21:46,050
of are a few a a few guys behind closed
doors

351
00:21:46,050 --> 00:21:49,830
I and we don't know %ah we can hold into

352
00:21:49,830 --> 00:21:53,330
they don't to us they don't even answer
to the whole bottle

353
00:21:53,330 --> 00:21:57,430
homes their own 8 members in congress
the cop gennady

354
00:21:57,430 --> 00:22:01,170
get full breed on these intelligence
programs and interest in

355
00:22:01,170 --> 00:22:04,800
are the intelligence community the
intelligence committees the response

356
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:10,020
overseas problems are these guys who
have access to class on

357
00:22:10,020 --> 00:22:13,560
mention Dame receive more

358
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:17,950
month from actually all every single
members committee

359
00:22:17,950 --> 00:22:21,450
receives money from a top 20
intelligence are

360
00:22:21,450 --> 00:22:26,250
companies United States and they also
receive more

361
00:22:26,250 --> 00:22:29,590
money from these companies than any
other members and cons I in fact

362
00:22:29,590 --> 00:22:32,910
a single one up these %uh congressman
his

363
00:22:32,910 --> 00:22:37,880
his name's Dutch Ruppersberger received
over 350 brain

364
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:42,950
from D's companies along that's not
always as donations that's just from the

365
00:22:42,950 --> 00:22:43,940
stop on

366
00:22:43,940 --> 00:22:48,570
so when we think about the revelations
when we think about the fact that we've

367
00:22:48,570 --> 00:22:49,210
learned

368
00:22:49,210 --> 00:22:53,320
what's going on we have an ability to be
we have the ability to correct

369
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:57,120
this fall reach up when we have the
ability the protest

370
00:22:57,120 --> 00:23:00,480
unconstitutional activities never should
have begun we

371
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:04,350
also have a broader I civic
understanding of how our government

372
00:23:04,350 --> 00:23:05,050
works

373
00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:08,340
we see the most senior officials and
government didn't lie

374
00:23:08,340 --> 00:23:11,350
under oath and making false statements
to Congress noble

375
00:23:11,350 --> 00:23:14,780
James clapper but not just congress not
just a lot more

376
00:23:14,780 --> 00:23:18,140
there are the ones that didn't get as
much attention for example

377
00:23:18,140 --> 00:23:21,880
the Department justice general the
United States

378
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:25,690
he'd long to the Supreme Court twice

379
00:23:25,690 --> 00:23:28,820
in writing and it was in the New York
Times

380
00:23:28,820 --> 00:23:32,150
well you know this and become the front
page news that you know persists

381
00:23:32,150 --> 00:23:35,400
and we respond to but it was a direct

382
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:38,560
revolution that came out on the
newspaper

383
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:42,730
on June's was when we found that people
had anticipated

384
00:23:42,730 --> 00:23:48,640
are to dial back because its technical
terms it's important what happened

385
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:51,960
is the government was using war

386
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:55,200
was so its to collect evidence

387
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:58,750
to justify war applications for warmth
serving

388
00:23:58,750 --> 00:24:02,550
that's a violation about the fourth and
the system in

389
00:24:02,550 --> 00:24:08,010
for people who keep school are and
what's interesting is

390
00:24:08,010 --> 00:24:12,130
they didn't report this to the court's
and he didn't report this to the fans

391
00:24:12,130 --> 00:24:15,880
but then they later told the Supreme
Court that they were and it turned out

392
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:16,560
that was untrue

393
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:20,010
if we don't know these kind of things

394
00:24:20,010 --> 00:24:23,910
we don't know are gone we have to be
able to know not just what governments

395
00:24:23,910 --> 00:24:24,670
do but holy

396
00:24:24,670 --> 00:24:28,470
act in order to decide how close the
wounds from my sons

397
00:24:28,470 --> 00:24:32,280
if we didn't have whistleblowers like
you like Tom Brady my everybody else has

398
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:33,020
come forward

399
00:24:33,020 --> 00:24:36,840
minutes whilst we would have a blast
open less for you must Campbell side

400
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:40,360
and because of that I think it's worth
taking risks to do this

401
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:43,679
any its it's not just watching

402
00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:48,340
you know that this scandal is what easy
the scandals what's happening every day

403
00:24:48,340 --> 00:24:51,870
unconstitutional at least they're still
turn right now

404
00:24:51,870 --> 00:24:56,920
the fact that we looking at arm present
want things that can talk about a lot

405
00:24:56,920 --> 00:25:00,890
he's have pics this the fact that a the
most

406
00:25:00,890 --> 00:25:05,350
the least controversial I in terms of do
we can

407
00:25:05,350 --> 00:25:08,940
does this chin is sections yell

408
00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:12,770
and section 213 Patriot Act

409
00:25:12,770 --> 00:25:17,160
basically says the hay we can collect
call records Madacy records from

410
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:20,250
everyone regardless of whether they are
suspected and crime

411
00:25:20,250 --> 00:25:23,419
in wrong and we have yet

412
00:25:23,419 --> 00:25:26,830
you know what does that do why are they
doing this ones that

413
00:25:26,830 --> 00:25:30,760
because the imprint communications right
they don't get anything this is just

414
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:34,150
this is just the signaling it's like
we're par

415
00:25:34,150 --> 00:25:37,260
private acts the me who you talk to

416
00:25:37,260 --> 00:25:40,700
when it happened where was that not

417
00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:44,179
I the exact contact what was said
schools

418
00:25:44,179 --> 00:25:47,669
so encryption protects the content but
we forget about

419
00:25:47,669 --> 00:25:52,200
Association and that's what this is
about these programs like section 2

420
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:55,350
en masse general is not about serving
you

421
00:25:55,350 --> 00:25:58,750
it's not about serving me it's about
supreme

422
00:25:58,750 --> 00:26:02,870
us colette it's about watching the comp
in

423
00:26:02,870 --> 00:26:06,580
for everybody in the country and on a
global scale

424
00:26:06,580 --> 00:26:10,550
this is basically a big data program
which provides the raw data

425
00:26:10,550 --> 00:26:16,350
and then be analyzed seeking seltzer I
can be subjected to rules for

426
00:26:16,350 --> 00:26:21,490
for I it says everything you do

427
00:26:21,490 --> 00:26:24,800
is being analyzed it's being we it's
being

428
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:28,330
mention and that's without regard to
whether or not

429
00:26:28,330 --> 00:26:31,360
you've done anything wrong are so when
people say

430
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:35,490
you why does this matter well why do I
care know washington doubles

431
00:26:35,490 --> 00:26:40,610
couch it's because again we think about
this in terms of the fourth

432
00:26:40,610 --> 00:26:44,330
it's in unreasonable singe because
there's nothing to just up to

433
00:26:44,330 --> 00:26:48,270
happened batsman Britain's were the due
process

434
00:26:48,270 --> 00:26:51,919
she's on the system where the government
is basically saying

435
00:26:51,919 --> 00:26:54,960
we're gonna use warrantless surveillance

436
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:59,690
to collect evidence to then secretly
used to get a warm

437
00:26:59,690 --> 00:27:03,210
or the first time in shins

438
00:27:03,210 --> 00:27:07,090
our freedom tools she right Congress
shall make no

439
00:27:07,090 --> 00:27:10,560
law abridging the freedom prospects

440
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:14,330
or write to us she the to enjoy the
company

441
00:27:14,330 --> 00:27:17,520
whoever we want if

442
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:21,320
you what are your rights from moment you
lost them for a lifetime

443
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:25,080
and that's why this matters is because
it happened and we didn't know

444
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:29,380
your whole in the post-september 11th
period we had programs

445
00:27:29,380 --> 00:27:33,110
up on stones the correct doctor internet
meta-data

446
00:27:33,110 --> 00:27:36,390
or home in meta data it was screen

447
00:27:36,390 --> 00:27:40,410
on massive he robust dataset

448
00:27:40,410 --> 00:27:44,560
that allows us to look at connections I
and action programmatically

449
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:48,470
in Los up everybody every polls

450
00:27:48,470 --> 00:27:51,650
all the time and I think that's not good
that's

451
00:27:51,650 --> 00:27:55,050
momentum unamerican thing and I think We
the People

452
00:27:55,050 --> 00:27:59,280
you the people you miss one right now
have both means and capability

453
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:03,070
to help deal a better future by encoding

454
00:28:03,070 --> 00:28:07,760
our rights into the programs and phone
calls on which means life every day

455
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:11,240
and that's what a lot of my future work
is going to be involved in and I hope

456
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:15,450
you'll join me read in the press every
other organization

457
00:28:15,450 --> 00:28:22,450
in making that

458
00:28:29,799 --> 00:28:33,929
so I should mention both dan ellsberg

459
00:28:33,929 --> 00:28:38,450
and now it's known are on frequent press
foundation's board of directors in

460
00:28:38,450 --> 00:28:43,309
we really want to make it our call to
help journals and sources and everyone

461
00:28:43,309 --> 00:28:46,419
can act in a way they can be

462
00:28:46,419 --> 00:28:50,279
protected on from the government size
when

463
00:28:50,279 --> 00:28:53,330
and essentially protect our right to
privacy

464
00:28:53,330 --> 00:28:56,470
and free speech and sell I think

465
00:28:56,470 --> 00:29:00,039
that brings me to my next question for
ed

466
00:29:00,039 --> 00:29:04,200
and this comes from mom one of the asked
own questions on Twitter

467
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:07,250
is what specifically can designers and
developers

468
00:29:07,250 --> 00:29:11,299
and others working in technology start
to do to make things better

469
00:29:11,299 --> 00:29:14,200
better in are there specific examples
out there that you would like to see

470
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:15,049
people follow

471
00:29:15,049 --> 00:29:19,940
so when i when i wanna talk about this
it's always difficult because it is

472
00:29:19,940 --> 00:29:23,399
entirely dependent on the threat model
or the individual was offered

473
00:29:23,399 --> 00:29:29,320
you know I gam gam home has a different
set of priorities

474
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:33,080
then somebody who's working I to report

475
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:37,190
on the now seasons deeply irresponsible
government and Fort

476
00:29:37,190 --> 00:29:41,140
she I and so generally when I talk about
this lesson

477
00:29:41,140 --> 00:29:44,880
as encryption Persian Persian because
it's an important

478
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:49,059
first step that denies the government
access to anything more to the grievance

479
00:29:49,059 --> 00:29:50,080
suspicion

480
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:53,299
which is drawn from Association but when
we talk about how we

481
00:29:53,299 --> 00:29:57,260
it's the stuff for the future we gotta
realize that Association

482
00:29:57,260 --> 00:30:01,190
is often home he doesn't ended action it
starts in

483
00:30:01,190 --> 00:30:04,260
friction because you don't think about
the links

484
00:30:04,260 --> 00:30:07,470
slim the signals that are happening when
I'm emailed you

485
00:30:07,470 --> 00:30:10,580
we gonna can read content the
communication medical

486
00:30:10,580 --> 00:30:15,870
you know why I'm way the government I
who was at work on Thursday

487
00:30:15,870 --> 00:30:20,220
Central Intelligence Agency and the
National Security Agency where the FBI

488
00:30:20,220 --> 00:30:24,210
who works on programs which would be
deeply embarrassing governor

489
00:30:24,210 --> 00:30:28,039
wire--the contacting someone at the
freemen prestige on the Washington Post

490
00:30:28,039 --> 00:30:29,010
The New York Times

491
00:30:29,010 --> 00:30:32,919
and so the tools like securing drop
which are good because their last year

492
00:30:32,919 --> 00:30:35,070
mix round networks locked or

493
00:30:35,070 --> 00:30:40,120
on to this work obviously don't direct
network path but we gotta think about

494
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:43,010
the fact that today if people are
connecting through phone that's not

495
00:30:43,010 --> 00:30:46,640
super helpful because the phone for
example sees that

496
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:50,490
you're connecting to toward it seems
you're toward user

497
00:30:50,490 --> 00:30:57,340
on a good example this really bad
example in terms of sex is this recent

498
00:30:57,340 --> 00:31:01,429
American spy was discovered in germ not
he was apparently

499
00:31:01,429 --> 00:31:05,710
alleged in the newspapers spying for the
United States against German

500
00:31:05,710 --> 00:31:09,559
hi he then I guess wasn't satisfied with
with what was going on

501
00:31:09,559 --> 00:31:14,230
so he said hey I'm in shock myself to
what I think are the russians because he

502
00:31:14,230 --> 00:31:15,190
got it email

503
00:31:15,190 --> 00:31:19,720
gene great perhaps I need any help

504
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:23,409
with the Russian embassy and Asia hey on
saw some doctors he said

505
00:31:23,409 --> 00:31:27,820
oh yeah sure sure and he sent them three
class products

506
00:31:27,820 --> 00:31:32,530
arm now this is an email I don't know
whether it's a and kryptonite for

507
00:31:32,530 --> 00:31:35,940
has women covered in detail with the key
is

508
00:31:35,940 --> 00:31:39,059
I yeah for sure it was on this and

509
00:31:39,059 --> 00:31:42,530
the communication I in this case german
counterintelligence

510
00:31:42,530 --> 00:31:46,120
his mom although he's actual alleged
spot his knowledge

511
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:49,510
over injures he's interested in money
arm

512
00:31:49,510 --> 00:31:53,220
is a the fact that when he did this

513
00:31:53,220 --> 00:31:56,289
he was the only one who had access to
these documents whose

514
00:31:56,289 --> 00:32:00,330
out of the office at the time took the
day off the Sensei again you know we're

515
00:32:00,330 --> 00:32:01,309
not talking about the most

516
00:32:01,309 --> 00:32:04,669
missed getting on or with this is the
kind of thing you have to worry

517
00:32:04,669 --> 00:32:08,559
in terms of how do governments

518
00:32:08,559 --> 00:32:11,860
I discovered the Raptors

519
00:32:11,860 --> 00:32:15,120
and the same techniques they use to
discover Sly's

520
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:18,389
to you stepper germs arm

521
00:32:18,389 --> 00:32:23,090
you know that arise in case I and the
rose in case

522
00:32:23,090 --> 00:32:26,639
on both of these are journalists in the
United States where for example

523
00:32:26,639 --> 00:32:29,620
are the government was trying to get a
chance rise in New York Times reports

524
00:32:29,620 --> 00:32:30,039
reveal

525
00:32:30,039 --> 00:32:33,070
source or they were subpoenaing

526
00:32:33,070 --> 00:32:36,820
I AP reporter we all the songs

527
00:32:36,820 --> 00:32:41,070
I all the phones in their office to say
who from the government

528
00:32:41,070 --> 00:32:45,110
all the Associated Press these are
Association

529
00:32:45,110 --> 00:32:47,940
since they didn't get the content of the
calls but they were trying to figure out

530
00:32:47,940 --> 00:32:48,669
what's going on

531
00:32:48,669 --> 00:32:51,820
when we think about how we nixon's

532
00:32:51,820 --> 00:32:56,059
problematic we think about things in
terms of protocols we need to have

533
00:32:56,059 --> 00:32:59,370
for causes a resistant to traffic
analysis be happened

534
00:32:59,370 --> 00:33:03,179
basically even if they're some level
performance Lt see can't look at

535
00:33:03,179 --> 00:33:04,889
differences in for example Skype

536
00:33:04,889 --> 00:33:08,169
conversations and tell which shot from
were

537
00:33:08,169 --> 00:33:11,179
was spoken I'm based on packet size

538
00:33:11,179 --> 00:33:14,440
the signals the so-and-so were on

539
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:17,649
you also need to use some sort mixed

540
00:33:17,649 --> 00:33:21,780
route some sort shared infrastructure
that die forces

541
00:33:21,780 --> 00:33:25,139
that individual connection from the
individual

542
00:33:25,139 --> 00:33:28,520
origination and that's the heart problem
it's all things were

543
00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:31,820
a performance a performance respect me

544
00:33:31,820 --> 00:33:34,929
toward is a really good job combat tours
all cities

545
00:33:34,929 --> 00:33:39,070
the only person you DP are men and a lot
of things like that

546
00:33:39,070 --> 00:33:42,480
but I this is this is something that's
that's better

547
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:45,500
really get down and have everybody get
into

548
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:49,820
sore red somebody pitches and I'm and
young people community whether that's

549
00:33:49,820 --> 00:33:50,629
clear

550
00:33:50,629 --> 00:33:55,030
whether that's a mailing list each year
it's the pure remarked that time do

551
00:33:55,030 --> 00:33:55,750
these things

552
00:33:55,750 --> 00:33:58,929
6 need people to attack these systems

553
00:33:58,929 --> 00:34:02,490
we need people to work with adversaries
on all

554
00:34:02,490 --> 00:34:06,139
so we can fix them and there's also the
user experience

555
00:34:06,139 --> 00:34:09,740
issue for example GPG is reposted pretty
reliable

556
00:34:09,740 --> 00:34:13,319
on encryption unfortunately it's damn
near unused

557
00:34:13,319 --> 00:34:18,290
and he are its fine too comfortable with
command line it's fine if you're good

558
00:34:18,290 --> 00:34:22,470
key management but again game game at
the home is never going to be able to do

559
00:34:22,470 --> 00:34:22,980
that

560
00:34:22,980 --> 00:34:26,349
sort we need encryption

561
00:34:26,349 --> 00:34:30,599
makes routing need are non attributed

562
00:34:30,599 --> 00:34:34,060
communications arm or on attributable

563
00:34:34,060 --> 00:34:38,490
even access URL for example that's
available to people

564
00:34:38,490 --> 00:34:42,109
which easy it's transparent and that's
why

565
00:34:42,109 --> 00:34:45,790
cool on that we can use not just here in
the United States but around the world

566
00:34:45,790 --> 00:34:50,819
is again this is a global prop I the
National Security Agency the FBI

567
00:34:50,819 --> 00:34:56,819
these guys love way because we've got
the biggest budget 100 most rest

568
00:34:56,819 --> 00:35:00,710
but we're only the sparks remarkable
last this is going to be a lot worse

569
00:35:00,710 --> 00:35:05,569
words there and we have to do you know
the grad students in the world

570
00:35:05,569 --> 00:35:08,700
have to be thinking about what they can
do to fix this

571
00:35:08,700 --> 00:35:12,290
anything can have a shared arms need to
think about

572
00:35:12,290 --> 00:35:15,780
how are so worst people

573
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:19,330
on or going to try this for and Brent

574
00:35:19,330 --> 00:35:23,280
your system not just damage individuals

575
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:26,760
but today image governments to shield
themselves from

576
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:30,060
oversight and accountability and what
can you

577
00:35:30,060 --> 00:35:33,210
what do you know what can you think up

578
00:35:33,210 --> 00:35:38,290
to help shield us from and the
techniques wrong with my imagination

579
00:35:38,290 --> 00:35:41,619
at Duke a couple

580
00:35:41,619 --> 00:35:45,710
thing

581
00:35:45,710 --> 00:35:50,690
okay help people were taking notes your
honor I in the darkness

582
00:35:50,690 --> 00:35:54,069
her tech texting on the suggestion

583
00:35:54,069 --> 00:35:57,349
he's giving you your much earlier orders
a good

584
00:35:57,349 --> 00:36:01,390
up they know this stuff just for her

585
00:36:01,390 --> 00:36:04,940
I'll just two things to meet me

586
00:36:04,940 --> 00:36:08,440
gotta like like your have to take this
off but may have to say

587
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:12,819
with Mike with my hearing problem the
reverberation

588
00:36:12,819 --> 00:36:18,040
earlier before these was such that I
missed a lot I'm sorry I look forward

589
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:23,170
scenery broadening our on this on the
web I missed a lot of work

590
00:36:23,170 --> 00:36:26,920
say I'm sorry to say but now I can with
this

591
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:30,609
not when I'm talking

592
00:36:30,609 --> 00:36:34,470
two things we've been talking a lot
about your

593
00:36:34,470 --> 00:36:37,540
people out here helping

594
00:36:37,540 --> 00:36:40,599
sources extreme importance

595
00:36:40,599 --> 00:36:44,000
helping sources anonymously and without
being a tribunal

596
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:47,690
get there information to journalists to
this story true germs

597
00:36:47,690 --> 00:36:51,119
this entry into the public and congress
very possibly

598
00:36:51,119 --> 00:36:56,069
I'll for example with the overhearing
that we just heard about Kanal feinstein

599
00:36:56,069 --> 00:36:59,470
by CIA I it's a it's real trick to get
this stuff

600
00:36:59,470 --> 00:37:02,920
even to the Intelligence Committee which
kind of a black hole for information

601
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:03,680
anyway

602
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:07,109
but I can't get it to them without the
CIA knowing

603
00:37:07,109 --> 00:37:10,710
there is also the problem there isn't
going directly after journalists and if

604
00:37:10,710 --> 00:37:13,060
you're sick this is what I was thinking

605
00:37:13,060 --> 00:37:16,830
if you are successful in inspiring the
people here

606
00:37:16,830 --> 00:37:20,240
to dis to find way for software

607
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:24,850
the they can really use you know with
even is

608
00:37:24,850 --> 00:37:27,970
I'm not even on Twitter for example

609
00:37:27,970 --> 00:37:31,200
at my age it's enough to be on Gmail

610
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:34,359
so easy to use

611
00:37:34,359 --> 00:37:39,970
van they need right now when they can
find resources and shut them off

612
00:37:39,970 --> 00:37:44,020
that gives you your government control
pressure a government person is simply

613
00:37:44,020 --> 00:37:47,260
authorized information from the
government whether it's classified or

614
00:37:47,260 --> 00:37:47,799
not

615
00:37:47,799 --> 00:37:51,700
they put out a lot of information is
classified because it supports

616
00:37:51,700 --> 00:37:55,560
their programs and their their
reputation what not so most

617
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:58,589
leaks a classified information are
actually

618
00:37:58,589 --> 00:38:02,660
authorized by an agency or a high
official winner but supposing it becomes

619
00:38:02,660 --> 00:38:03,869
possible now for that

620
00:38:03,869 --> 00:38:07,520
handful whistleblowers really to get the
information

621
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:11,140
then they would wanna go after the
byline journalist who prints

622
00:38:11,140 --> 00:38:14,589
now so far they have not done that the

623
00:38:14,589 --> 00:38:18,030
they accept the idea that the public
will go along with prosecutions have

624
00:38:18,030 --> 00:38:18,869
officials

625
00:38:18,869 --> 00:38:22,109
who signed a nondisclosure agreement as
I did

626
00:38:22,109 --> 00:38:25,170
or you did are and without

627
00:38:25,170 --> 00:38:29,359
really thinking at the fact that that
that agreement is not

628
00:38:29,359 --> 00:38:33,280
subject in corporations are also under
criminal prosecution drew

629
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:37,580
punishment by prison 100 subject to a
lot of other things like ostracism

630
00:38:37,580 --> 00:38:41,510
your job which is enough to keep people
Simon anyway

631
00:38:41,510 --> 00:38:46,510
but supposing now that gets harder to do
when they can't shut off all the sources

632
00:38:46,510 --> 00:38:50,140
they haven't yet going against the
freedom of the press idea by directly

633
00:38:50,140 --> 00:38:52,250
prosecuting journalists

634
00:38:52,250 --> 00:38:57,630
assigns they have kept on I guess you're
always time for the grand jury going

635
00:38:57,630 --> 00:39:00,580
with the threat basically that they're
gonna go after him on the grounds that

636
00:39:00,580 --> 00:39:02,190
he's not a real journalist

637
00:39:02,190 --> 00:39:05,530
something like that mean between person
but

638
00:39:05,530 --> 00:39:09,100
a actually of course as you know when I
know the people

639
00:39:09,100 --> 00:39:13,520
signs didn't do anything that could
possibly really be

640
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:17,359
prosecuted the question also done by the
New York Times and by the Guardian by

641
00:39:17,359 --> 00:39:18,230
the driver

642
00:39:18,230 --> 00:39:21,540
which they're reluctant to go after its
my

643
00:39:21,540 --> 00:39:24,880
opinion I'm I'm putting this to you but
my opinion

644
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:28,130
that that lies next on the ground

645
00:39:28,130 --> 00:39:31,580
that supposed journalist called michael
kinsley

646
00:39:31,580 --> 00:39:36,830
I accused bring greenwald and Peter King
is done the same and I think

647
00:39:36,830 --> 00:39:41,390
a number of others and that is you guys
you journalists

648
00:39:41,390 --> 00:39:45,319
are aiding and abetting a a crime

649
00:39:45,319 --> 00:39:48,650
a criminal with the assumption being
from the beginning

650
00:39:48,650 --> 00:39:51,890
it still leaking is criminally meyer et
seq questions to

651
00:39:51,890 --> 00:39:55,490
whether it should be regarded as
constitutional to regard us

652
00:39:55,490 --> 00:39:59,900
as criminals but if you do unequivocally
regard as a scramble

653
00:39:59,900 --> 00:40:03,540
and people like you then the logic

654
00:40:03,540 --> 00:40:07,600
the people who are helping them get the
information to the public

655
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:10,810
are indeed helping for sure that's what
they are doing

656
00:40:10,810 --> 00:40:13,900
but aiding and abetting is a legal term

657
00:40:13,900 --> 00:40:16,970
and it has to do with the crime and
perpetrating

658
00:40:16,970 --> 00:40:20,049
with David Gregory a on ass cream or

659
00:40:20,049 --> 00:40:23,350
you know in so far as you are aiding and
abetting

660
00:40:23,350 --> 00:40:27,900
his its shaky thing in so far as your
why should you not be punished

661
00:40:27,900 --> 00:40:32,589
so missing you I was really thinking I
didn't bring it up before

662
00:40:32,589 --> 00:40:37,200
to accept that the giving the
information is unequivocally cripple

663
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:41,560
unequivocally from is I think the first
step almost surely

664
00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:45,440
to going along with kinsley and Gregory
and so many others

665
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:48,910
aiding and abetting rather helping
publishing is also

666
00:40:48,910 --> 00:40:52,490
criminal seems logical normal are

667
00:40:52,490 --> 00:40:55,609
and they will go there will go after
that

668
00:40:55,609 --> 00:40:59,630
as well so I know is that something you
thought about her

669
00:40:59,630 --> 00:41:02,730
no I mean it's it's a really complex

670
00:41:02,730 --> 00:41:07,339
are topic and i'm taking

671
00:41:07,339 --> 00:41:10,770
when we talk about whether or not the
government begins going

672
00:41:10,770 --> 00:41:14,900
after journalists this is the real
sticking point for me because

673
00:41:14,900 --> 00:41:20,130
in terms all my political loss has the
latest technology here

674
00:41:20,130 --> 00:41:23,440
is I would say almost all minutes

675
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:27,990
on when of

676
00:41:27,990 --> 00:41:32,580
when we think about three small we need
to think about software

677
00:41:32,580 --> 00:41:36,650
mean that express are freedom but also
defended

678
00:41:36,650 --> 00:41:41,339
are governments remind the same
technologies

679
00:41:41,339 --> 00:41:45,150
the doc the same standards the use the
same

680
00:41:45,150 --> 00:41:50,119
and this happens World War so the
solution to that

681
00:41:50,119 --> 00:41:53,740
I when you ask me is

682
00:41:53,740 --> 00:41:57,510
whether or not the united states
government can manage to

683
00:41:57,510 --> 00:42:00,690
behave itself to restrain itself against
violent

684
00:42:00,690 --> 00:42:04,600
Constitution against bring suits against
journalist against

685
00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:07,750
limiting the freedom press other
governments will make different

686
00:42:07,750 --> 00:42:08,980
decisions

687
00:42:08,980 --> 00:42:12,890
and if we want to live in a better more
online world what we need to do is we

688
00:42:12,890 --> 00:42:13,839
need to remove

689
00:42:13,839 --> 00:42:16,920
those capabilities from the government's
by

690
00:42:16,920 --> 00:42:20,740
enshrine our rights into our means

691
00:42:20,740 --> 00:42:24,480
by denying them those buildings at least
on a massive

692
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:28,000
on hard-luck occasional can't pitches
Road

693
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:31,200
every mobile phone never competed out
that works gonna

694
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:34,400
call any of our research an end up on

695
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:39,240
you now burge Ars Technica or any one of
these other sites

696
00:42:39,240 --> 00:42:42,549
arm and this can be post-mortem them out
this can be reused

697
00:42:42,549 --> 00:42:46,109
repurpose their find out didn't respect
mom

698
00:42:46,109 --> 00:42:50,290
but governments can still pursue their
legitimate needs

699
00:42:50,290 --> 00:42:54,190
from law enforcement for intelligence
collection on a targeted basis by use

700
00:42:54,190 --> 00:42:58,290
those your days only when they are the
least intrusive

701
00:42:58,290 --> 00:43:02,140
and sensual means getting intelligence
that they require

702
00:43:02,140 --> 00:43:05,609
but it's worth a shot not doing this on
a broad social level when the target

703
00:43:05,609 --> 00:43:09,140
every journalist the top every music see

704
00:43:09,140 --> 00:43:12,220
and this is this is the way I think in
the future

705
00:43:12,220 --> 00:43:16,220
me to focus more more toward how we do
this

706
00:43:16,220 --> 00:43:20,700
and when you talk about journalists like
David Gregory like michael kinsley after

707
00:43:20,700 --> 00:43:21,650
the onset he had

708
00:43:21,650 --> 00:43:25,260
follow that story michael kinsley Arden
basically that was not a place

709
00:43:25,260 --> 00:43:26,510
journalists

710
00:43:26,510 --> 00:43:30,660
to decide what the public should and
should not now isn't a misquote was

711
00:43:30,660 --> 00:43:33,900
that decision as to what we the public
should know must

712
00:43:33,900 --> 00:43:39,190
ultimately be lined up

713
00:43:39,190 --> 00:43:42,380
some people can are but it's a

714
00:43:42,380 --> 00:43:45,730
the key there is that East Dr
representing class

715
00:43:45,730 --> 00:43:49,140
interests and we need to recognize them
as the class like

716
00:43:49,140 --> 00:43:52,589
these germs who are basically
reflexively

717
00:43:52,589 --> 00:43:56,130
going to protect policies

718
00:43:56,130 --> 00:43:59,830
that are working against the public
interest should not be trusted to inform

719
00:43:59,830 --> 00:44:03,270
us right need to mark their names and
remember what the right now

720
00:44:03,270 --> 00:44:06,339
it's helpful that we get all these
different views now they

721
00:44:06,339 --> 00:44:09,380
you participate in the event option for
most mean that more

722
00:44:09,380 --> 00:44:13,280
ideas but at the same time when it's
being done

723
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:16,869
to actually limited when they're saying
these people shouldn't

724
00:44:16,869 --> 00:44:20,470
make these people should be able to
publish stands

725
00:44:20,470 --> 00:44:24,630
this news should never means we watch
out

726
00:44:24,630 --> 00:44:28,210
because that not ever benefit public
that's making

727
00:44:28,210 --> 00:44:32,040
our society that government institutions
necessarily less

728
00:44:32,040 --> 00:44:35,119
now I mean it's a challenge second

729
00:44:35,119 --> 00:44:38,430
or on in terms of class interested can
we talk about her

730
00:44:38,430 --> 00:44:42,450
Texas and passions holes Julius Ainge

731
00:44:42,450 --> 00:44:45,750
we at one point where is that hackers
world sis

732
00:44:45,750 --> 00:44:49,099
sisson world night anybody out there who
you know

733
00:44:49,099 --> 00:44:53,280
posts on Stack Overflow the Stack
Exchange Inc

734
00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:57,500
arm you guys are parked technical lead

735
00:44:57,500 --> 00:45:00,720
right if you mean her of poor work a

736
00:45:00,720 --> 00:45:04,799
is or hoops were even opened ET now

737
00:45:04,799 --> 00:45:08,650
have a few even for clinics you know are

738
00:45:08,650 --> 00:45:12,650
hmm you're in advocate

739
00:45:12,650 --> 00:45:15,910
that is going to help us move forward

740
00:45:15,910 --> 00:45:19,730
in shifting the middle ground of
technical literacy for the National

741
00:45:19,730 --> 00:45:24,180
right along young people like are they
understand how technology works to

742
00:45:24,180 --> 00:45:25,319
extend

743
00:45:25,319 --> 00:45:29,319
but this is important to him they don't
know what we're doing

744
00:45:29,319 --> 00:45:32,490
right they don't know where the canoe
owns they don't know

745
00:45:32,490 --> 00:45:38,660
I have network works arm they trusted
devices to hang

746
00:45:38,660 --> 00:45:42,240
we all any of us no even the slightest

747
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:45,700
have a city beauty to help educate

748
00:45:45,700 --> 00:45:49,450
rounds just like the rise of course is
right we have an obligation

749
00:45:49,450 --> 00:45:52,509
to teach people around us how to read
and write

750
00:45:52,509 --> 00:45:55,940
we have to teach people in our society
how iraq

751
00:45:55,940 --> 00:45:59,630
society with our technology safe

752
00:45:59,630 --> 00:46:03,690
reliable in a way that serves the
interests of all of us not just a select

753
00:46:03,690 --> 00:46:05,470
few who don't wanna high priest

754
00:46:05,470 --> 00:46:08,640
technology no matter how good that is
for us

755
00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:11,940
because its best in the world on and

756
00:46:11,940 --> 00:46:18,940
unclear

757
00:46:20,330 --> 00:46:21,370
I I think

758
00:46:21,370 --> 00:46:24,470
go ahead and start no see I was very

759
00:46:24,470 --> 00:46:29,150
struck twice something you said in
Vanity Fair

760
00:46:29,150 --> 00:46:34,630
quarter which is that everyone image

761
00:46:34,630 --> 00:46:38,240
I thought I was restricted everyone a
vision I believe this is absolutely true

762
00:46:38,240 --> 00:46:42,020
has known things that were wrong

763
00:46:42,020 --> 00:46:46,430
saw things has seen things that were
wrong should be known that should be

764
00:46:46,430 --> 00:46:47,010
exposed

765
00:46:47,010 --> 00:46:50,090
and as you put it we have turned our
eyes away

766
00:46:50,090 --> 00:46:54,400
because we were intimidated and I
happened you were speaking of yourself

767
00:46:54,400 --> 00:46:59,680
speaking myself are come back to that
but I i believe that through every human

768
00:46:59,680 --> 00:47:03,700
on earth that there are times when the
bite their tongues

769
00:47:03,700 --> 00:47:06,850
they keep their mouth shut because to
reveal it would

770
00:47:06,850 --> 00:47:11,270
would destroy would lose a relationship
or a given very private matters

771
00:47:11,270 --> 00:47:14,560
or a job or career whatever

772
00:47:14,560 --> 00:47:18,340
and it kept and then you said a then you
said

773
00:47:18,340 --> 00:47:21,750
but there comes a time you know when the

774
00:47:21,750 --> 00:47:25,110
in level with him humanity or the
wrongness

775
00:47:25,110 --> 00:47:30,030
is so great that you have to cross over
that line is he said he said I crossed

776
00:47:30,030 --> 00:47:30,910
over that mine

777
00:47:30,910 --> 00:47:33,960
now to to tell true now

778
00:47:33,960 --> 00:47:37,770
I thought when I read that that's edward
smiled

779
00:47:37,770 --> 00:47:41,630
who get that and that's chelsea manager

780
00:47:41,630 --> 00:47:44,700
and how many others

781
00:47:44,700 --> 00:47:48,650
when you said there comes a time when
you very generally

782
00:47:48,650 --> 00:47:52,910
I'll cross over that line and tell the
truth even at cost

783
00:47:52,910 --> 00:47:56,710
to relationships to your boss to your
friends to your

784
00:47:56,710 --> 00:48:00,100
everything else most people I have to
say

785
00:48:00,100 --> 00:48:03,590
never do reach that mine may never reach
a point

786
00:48:03,590 --> 00:48:08,440
when they decide to take a risk other
own status in their own relationships

787
00:48:08,440 --> 00:48:12,890
and their own shop can attest to that is
that many of them have been tested on

788
00:48:12,890 --> 00:48:13,600
things like

789
00:48:13,600 --> 00:48:18,800
the continuation of a wrongful war of
thousands applies hundreds of thousands

790
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:20,160
in the case of tobacco

791
00:48:20,160 --> 00:48:23,300
they said 500,000 lives

792
00:48:23,300 --> 00:48:26,740
a year bossed by tobacco look at GM

793
00:48:26,740 --> 00:48:30,500
right now the handful but you know
striking where they deliberately covered

794
00:48:30,500 --> 00:48:31,510
up covered up is

795
00:48:31,510 --> 00:48:34,900
is not only me in the how many people
the tram

796
00:48:34,900 --> 00:48:38,620
know that lives were being lost in
people were being injured and who spoke

797
00:48:38,620 --> 00:48:39,030
I'll

798
00:48:39,030 --> 00:48:42,490
nobody don't think so are tobacco

799
00:48:42,490 --> 00:48:46,510
to people her leg one thing that I hope

800
00:48:46,510 --> 00:48:52,130
from you premier example is that more
people will be inspired

801
00:48:52,130 --> 00:48:56,970
to take even significant risks in other
words were talking when I am

802
00:48:56,970 --> 00:49:00,440
the whole group here about lowering the
risks for people

803
00:49:00,440 --> 00:49:04,250
and that's undoubtedly essential but in
the end

804
00:49:04,250 --> 00:49:08,540
there will always be a risk as you say
an point problems and so forth and the

805
00:49:08,540 --> 00:49:10,130
willingness to take that risk

806
00:49:10,130 --> 00:49:13,990
for civilians is very rare

807
00:49:13,990 --> 00:49:18,480
I it was a as you may know was bismarck
20 people who said

808
00:49:18,480 --> 00:49:22,000
civil courage she owns invented that
phrase signal-caller

809
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:26,210
the is very I think courage on the
battlefield

810
00:49:26,210 --> 00:49:30,820
is the very common in our country are
perfect country

811
00:49:30,820 --> 00:49:34,630
and at that point uses civil courage is
another matter

812
00:49:34,630 --> 00:49:40,210
very rare its willingness to risk now as
I said before Manning and before you

813
00:49:40,210 --> 00:49:43,330
I virtually give I i have to say it
almost given up on it

814
00:49:43,330 --> 00:49:47,590
and you're showing an example now
Manning didn't get the

815
00:49:47,590 --> 00:49:50,860
art gallery attention but he didn't get
the

816
00:49:50,860 --> 00:49:55,210
affecting this country except as I said
earlier for getting our troops home from

817
00:49:55,210 --> 00:49:55,740
Iraq

818
00:49:55,740 --> 00:49:59,090
that you did and why because I think

819
00:49:59,090 --> 00:50:02,330
in Manning's case he was showing what we
were doing to

820
00:50:02,330 --> 00:50:05,700
other people in the third world for
others

821
00:50:05,700 --> 00:50:09,710
model and you

822
00:50:09,710 --> 00:50:13,280
and i three in my case

823
00:50:13,280 --> 00:50:18,690
with the effect because it had millions
of Vietnamese that were being killed

824
00:50:18,690 --> 00:50:21,880
wrongly every one of them is wrong

825
00:50:21,880 --> 00:50:25,090
when I read the pentagon papers in real
life that from the

826
00:50:25,090 --> 00:50:28,440
for the first time that the very
beginning we were supporting a French

827
00:50:28,440 --> 00:50:31,810
colonial re-conquest to the country
which I thought of it

828
00:50:31,810 --> 00:50:35,180
on american weather was illegal
internationally or not

829
00:50:35,180 --> 00:50:38,760
I'm sure every death in vietnam

830
00:50:38,760 --> 00:50:42,060
as being unjustified homicide

831
00:50:42,060 --> 00:50:45,280
and to me that was murder mash

832
00:50:45,280 --> 00:50:48,520
murder and I couldn't be prouder that
anymore watching well

833
00:50:48,520 --> 00:50:51,790
the american people didn't respond I'm
sorry to say on the whole

834
00:50:51,790 --> 00:50:55,230
sharper people in audiences like this to
the mass murder

835
00:50:55,230 --> 00:50:59,590
but there were 58,000 Americans in the
process of dying them

836
00:50:59,590 --> 00:51:04,000
see and in your case again it wasn't so
much directly dime

837
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:08,590
but what was being done to us in people
are are objecting to that

838
00:51:08,590 --> 00:51:13,150
so I think we have to have a different
standard a new show the possible even

839
00:51:13,150 --> 00:51:17,300
your colleagues initially as you said

840
00:51:17,300 --> 00:51:20,600
agree with you many of them this is
wrong it shouldn't be happening

841
00:51:20,600 --> 00:51:24,060
but I have a mortgage I have a marriage
I have you know this in their

842
00:51:24,060 --> 00:51:27,810
children to go to college and that was
enough

843
00:51:27,810 --> 00:51:31,300
even though all were talking about this
massive

844
00:51:31,300 --> 00:51:35,400
you know intrusion which is a is a new
world basically the people need to know

845
00:51:35,400 --> 00:51:36,000
about

846
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:40,630
soap it shouldn't be only you I would
hope that some of your colleagues who

847
00:51:40,630 --> 00:51:46,190
I would suspect let me give you a little
PC experience from my experience

848
00:51:46,190 --> 00:51:50,530
if you were in the room with your former
colleagues now

849
00:51:50,530 --> 00:51:53,790
I would expect them to leave them

850
00:51:53,790 --> 00:51:57,570
that they would not be in touch with you
if you can tell me that the former

851
00:51:57,570 --> 00:51:59,630
colleague from NASA

852
00:51:59,630 --> 00:52:04,770
hasn't anyway communicated with you to
save did the right thing or in any way

853
00:52:04,770 --> 00:52:08,750
help it I would guess there was zero on
that that was my experience at the RAND

854
00:52:08,750 --> 00:52:09,720
Corporation

855
00:52:09,720 --> 00:52:13,330
you lose every friend you have who who
has a clear it sets from that's all your

856
00:52:13,330 --> 00:52:14,070
friends

857
00:52:14,070 --> 00:52:17,860
so liked you're not made of sugar as you
Sean

858
00:52:17,860 --> 00:52:21,400
a you can you can deal with that guy I

859
00:52:21,400 --> 00:52:27,080
for you say yesterday it was in the
paper if I mean change in guantanamo

860
00:52:27,080 --> 00:52:31,110
I can live with that well that didn't
surprise me that that's the

861
00:52:31,110 --> 00:52:35,540
that's the person I find you to be that
was not surprised it's pretty unusual

862
00:52:35,540 --> 00:52:36,350
statement

863
00:52:36,350 --> 00:52:40,020
you know after orgasm well let's make it
a little less unusual

864
00:52:40,020 --> 00:52:43,640
I'll you win in the Special Forces try
to get there

865
00:52:43,640 --> 00:52:47,170
and your legs broken so forth golden

866
00:52:47,170 --> 00:52:50,410
I used my marine training in vietnam is
a civilian

867
00:52:50,410 --> 00:52:54,080
I marine company commander in peacetime

868
00:52:54,080 --> 00:52:59,160
and so a user training in vietnam so I
saw combat I work with troops in combat

869
00:52:59,160 --> 00:53:02,270
there you see current physical courage

870
00:53:02,270 --> 00:53:05,730
every minute every day a people

871
00:53:05,730 --> 00:53:08,890
same doing the job was trying to say the
conference room

872
00:53:08,890 --> 00:53:12,190
the kind of courage is marvelous I

873
00:53:12,190 --> 00:53:16,090
marine one set on cock at terroir
uncommon you would remain

874
00:53:16,090 --> 00:53:20,070
uncommon courage was a common virtue
okay right

875
00:53:20,070 --> 00:53:23,690
when you're doing it for the boss for
the commander in chief with the applause

876
00:53:23,690 --> 00:53:27,850
appear country even if you don't get the
approach most of it is anonymous

877
00:53:27,850 --> 00:53:31,040
but you know they would approve you with
a new ever

878
00:53:31,040 --> 00:53:33,800
what they were doing in a they would
hold you accountable with you didn't do

879
00:53:33,800 --> 00:53:34,900
it

880
00:53:34,900 --> 00:53:39,220
we should have a different standard than
we do for civilian officials

881
00:53:39,220 --> 00:53:42,790
and not just official you know one of
them regarded himself as an official but

882
00:53:42,790 --> 00:53:45,210
a middle-level person

883
00:53:45,210 --> 00:53:50,070
you shouldn't be simply that you were
the extraordinary hero that we thank

884
00:53:50,070 --> 00:53:54,510
it should be that we should ask the
question of those other people

885
00:53:54,510 --> 00:53:57,830
hi me do you think you could keep this
secret that long

886
00:53:57,830 --> 00:54:01,650
keep it totally keep your miles a lot of
blood is road because people better

887
00:54:01,650 --> 00:54:02,630
times

888
00:54:02,630 --> 00:54:06,480
and swallow their whistles and dry
didn't speak out

889
00:54:06,480 --> 00:54:10,430
and it's time I think that we not
prosecute them but tell them

890
00:54:10,430 --> 00:54:13,480
that is not the way to preserve
democracy you were not

891
00:54:13,480 --> 00:54:17,930
fulfilling your oath and I'll just him
by saying

892
00:54:17,930 --> 00:54:21,260
people ask as I you is the Patriot

893
00:54:21,260 --> 00:54:24,470
or trader you know that's the headline
in all these things

894
00:54:24,470 --> 00:54:28,500
Edwards no patriot air that drives me
nuts the very thought you know

895
00:54:28,500 --> 00:54:31,920
that people could regard he was a
traitor the ignorance

896
00:54:31,920 --> 00:54:35,750
up the media and the congresspeople and
the other hand the interviewers

897
00:54:35,750 --> 00:54:39,900
grace that question offends me is an
American think think

898
00:54:39,900 --> 00:54:43,870
that it can be traitorous to tell the
truth to your fellow

899
00:54:43,870 --> 00:54:50,870
countrymen what

900
00:54:52,700 --> 00:54:57,390
to standard I would like to see said I'm
sure the standard I would like to thank

901
00:54:57,390 --> 00:55:02,010
known was the one person in the fucking

902
00:55:02,010 --> 00:55:07,029
NASA get what he absolutely should have
done how many people should have done

903
00:55:07,029 --> 00:55:07,700
what you did

904
00:55:07,700 --> 00:55:13,750
the killed healthy man

905
00:55:13,750 --> 00:55:19,059
confidence about country when it came
out I see it now

906
00:55:19,059 --> 00:55:23,359
I'll pp interpreter we all took the same
old

907
00:55:23,359 --> 00:55:26,660
to uphold and defend the Constitution
have already said

908
00:55:26,660 --> 00:55:30,589
the people who violated all the time
thousands are people who

909
00:55:30,589 --> 00:55:34,769
who are against it like changing some
other when it comes to

910
00:55:34,769 --> 00:55:38,940
proving that poll no one

911
00:55:38,940 --> 00:55:42,539
in the US military services up to the
commander in chief

912
00:55:42,539 --> 00:55:45,970
has fulfilled her oath

913
00:55:45,970 --> 00:55:49,609
to defend and support the Constitution
like Chelsea Manning

914
00:55:49,609 --> 00:55:53,200
and no one in the US executive branch in
any branch

915
00:55:53,200 --> 00:55:57,240
his filled your oath the oath to uphold
support the Constitution

916
00:55:57,240 --> 00:56:04,240
as well as you so thank you

917
00:56:10,520 --> 00:56:15,510
that's hot I would harm

918
00:56:15,510 --> 00:56:22,510
I'm still politically very modern

919
00:56:23,090 --> 00:56:27,420
you know I think it's funny very first
time

920
00:56:27,420 --> 00:56:32,820
I I met gland removed sort

921
00:56:32,820 --> 00:56:38,580
the lead journalist talk to in hong kong
he called me a wrap

922
00:56:38,580 --> 00:56:41,490
and that was a surprise me because that
was the first time I'd ever been home

923
00:56:41,490 --> 00:56:41,869
decal

924
00:56:41,869 --> 00:56:45,630
but he didn't mean it that way he called
you work

925
00:56:45,630 --> 00:56:49,060
set against arrest a poet

926
00:56:49,060 --> 00:56:53,210
radical action radical action right on

927
00:56:53,210 --> 00:56:56,920
with his I think there are so many
people throughout the government

928
00:56:56,920 --> 00:56:59,900
throughout the country we're trying to
do the right thing as you said

929
00:56:59,900 --> 00:57:03,550
there is this this burden this
compulsion

930
00:57:03,550 --> 00:57:06,849
this are operation inertia

931
00:57:06,849 --> 00:57:09,950
where they feel you know they

932
00:57:09,950 --> 00:57:13,340
we talked about its new office are
people who saw this as well

933
00:57:13,340 --> 00:57:16,599
who agreed this was wrong who were
disturbed by and

934
00:57:16,599 --> 00:57:20,460
who felt we needed to do something but
at the same time we all have a sense

935
00:57:20,460 --> 00:57:23,910
we all have more we all have lives we
all have things we want to do things we

936
00:57:23,910 --> 00:57:24,550
want you

937
00:57:24,550 --> 00:57:27,720
and you did you did too right

938
00:57:27,720 --> 00:57:33,250
why I mean I'll of Hawaii everybody you
know I i don't have to say I love my

939
00:57:33,250 --> 00:57:33,750
friend

940
00:57:33,750 --> 00:57:38,940
mom but you put a person's risk and I i
mean

941
00:57:38,940 --> 00:57:43,230
the highest possible on when I walked
out of the office from

942
00:57:43,230 --> 00:57:46,710
why on last day was that

943
00:57:46,710 --> 00:57:50,390
I would never make it out on your mom

944
00:57:50,390 --> 00:57:53,530
but I accepted that has I knew that

945
00:57:53,530 --> 00:57:57,450
as you said earlier we all have to win
it the

946
00:57:57,450 --> 00:58:00,530
level incivility inhumanity you can see

947
00:58:00,530 --> 00:58:03,990
and do nothing about and when you cross
that line

948
00:58:03,990 --> 00:58:07,400
you have to do something but at the same
time we can't

949
00:58:07,400 --> 00:58:12,280
we can judge people too harshly

950
00:58:12,280 --> 00:58:15,530
for human nature people have a different
analysis a different weighting

951
00:58:15,530 --> 00:58:19,740
risk at least for me are what's
important forces not

952
00:58:19,740 --> 00:58:23,460
and then between able in power I don't
wanna take

953
00:58:23,460 --> 00:58:28,310
negative stance judging them and saying
you didn't do what you're supposed to do

954
00:58:28,310 --> 00:58:32,190
you didn't do which use more will do
even if that is the case

955
00:58:32,190 --> 00:58:35,839
I think a min from an engineer's
perspective no how

956
00:58:35,839 --> 00:58:39,010
can we its how can the people

957
00:58:39,010 --> 00:58:42,750
in this room reduce the costs action

958
00:58:42,750 --> 00:58:46,030
how can the people in this room how can
people around the world who can

959
00:58:46,030 --> 00:58:49,520
n machine what's happened the last year
what

960
00:58:49,520 --> 00:58:53,089
thoughts %um about how we can make sure

961
00:58:53,089 --> 00:58:56,369
we get the truth what our government
spending

962
00:58:56,369 --> 00:59:00,200
that we have a seat at the table with
government regardless

963
00:59:00,200 --> 00:59:03,839
how to 410 government regardless of what
their response will be

964
00:59:03,839 --> 00:59:08,170
because when they do something wrong we
will now

965
00:59:08,170 --> 00:59:12,400
and they don't know who told the world
and

966
00:59:12,400 --> 00:59:16,500
critical misses the point this is not
about in this is not about you know one

967
00:59:16,500 --> 00:59:16,980
thing how

968
00:59:16,980 --> 00:59:20,500
welcome this is about time when
governments real

969
00:59:20,500 --> 00:59:23,690
its that when they do on wall

970
00:59:23,690 --> 00:59:26,660
things when they do on Constitution
things were when they do things that are

971
00:59:26,660 --> 00:59:28,270
entirely legal

972
00:59:28,270 --> 00:59:33,170
comprehensively in more we will find out
about

973
00:59:33,170 --> 00:59:37,520
that will change war that will change
the way we

974
00:59:37,520 --> 00:59:40,700
because the problem today is when you
bring

975
00:59:40,700 --> 00:59:44,359
you know I case when the system we have
today

976
00:59:44,359 --> 00:59:47,730
is I secret agencies

977
00:59:47,730 --> 00:59:51,390
operating under secret policies secret
interoperation

978
00:59:51,390 --> 00:59:54,900
interpretations loss overseen by secret
courts

979
00:59:54,900 --> 00:59:58,900
rusty words 35 use have said no

980
00:59:58,900 --> 01:00:02,410
only 13 times out 35,000

981
01:00:02,410 --> 01:00:07,220
when s the way it comes and you know
they're overseen by the

982
01:00:07,220 --> 01:00:10,490
congressman we're gonna pockets stuffed
home a lot of times like these

983
01:00:10,490 --> 01:00:13,980
intelligence contracting companies are
what

984
01:00:13,980 --> 01:00:17,880
the government has done when we look at
this anyone other steps

985
01:00:17,880 --> 01:00:21,230
isolation fact that it takes 10 years to
get this for dinner

986
01:00:21,230 --> 01:00:24,369
open chords at the supreme court's that
the secret war

987
01:00:24,369 --> 01:00:27,950
when we look at what that is and
isolation any step it might look like

988
01:00:27,950 --> 01:00:31,330
you know clever morning by the cup but
when we look at Copper

989
01:00:31,330 --> 01:00:34,859
it comprehensively one he is is the
government has developed

990
01:00:34,859 --> 01:00:39,220
and expunge the Copperhead provides
basically the room

991
01:00:39,220 --> 01:00:42,510
passable to our constitution the escaped

992
01:00:42,510 --> 01:00:45,750
the sandbox our democracy and they're
basically

993
01:00:45,750 --> 01:00:48,930
using to change are built rights

994
01:00:48,930 --> 01:00:52,400
without mercy and we will go what is the
bill right say

995
01:00:52,400 --> 01:00:56,250
brutus I miss all well for a moment
still there but in reality it's gone

996
01:00:56,250 --> 01:00:59,780
something completely different happen
beyond behind-the-scenes

997
01:00:59,780 --> 01:01:03,080
and we can't allow that and the only way

998
01:01:03,080 --> 01:01:07,780
we can stop that from being
retrospective action where we go back to

999
01:01:07,780 --> 01:01:09,420
investigate and try to figure out

1000
01:01:09,420 --> 01:01:12,640
who did something wrong who we should
hold to account is we have to make sure

1001
01:01:12,640 --> 01:01:13,950
we stop it

1002
01:01:13,950 --> 01:01:18,170
work at only way that's going to happen
is we have transparency

1003
01:01:18,170 --> 01:01:20,980
we have accountability to the senior
officials who popped up in the first

1004
01:01:20,980 --> 01:01:27,980
place

1005
01:01:38,140 --> 01:01:45,140
and

1006
01:01:48,620 --> 01:01:50,020
well very good

1007
01:01:50,020 --> 01:01:53,450
are I for civil let me say I

1008
01:01:53,450 --> 01:01:56,970
I agree I understand what you're saying
don't condemn these people working on

1009
01:01:56,970 --> 01:01:58,200
that is the important thing

1010
01:01:58,200 --> 01:02:02,920
but you when I are talking we're having
a real discussion here because we do

1011
01:02:02,920 --> 01:02:04,490
have a somewhat different focus

1012
01:02:04,490 --> 01:02:08,480
and I happen to think that both
approaches are important

1013
01:02:08,480 --> 01:02:12,090
when we think actually

1014
01:02:12,090 --> 01:02:17,700
when I I keep mentioning is forty years
between nineteen 73 with my trial ended

1015
01:02:17,700 --> 01:02:18,620
in 2000

1016
01:02:18,620 --> 01:02:21,820
13 when you came out

1017
01:02:21,820 --> 01:02:24,860
for years or 71 2010 so for

1018
01:02:24,860 --> 01:02:30,640
I in fact came to feel that I was
apparently just asking too much

1019
01:02:30,640 --> 01:02:33,700
that somehow you

1020
01:02:33,700 --> 01:02:36,790
you keep saying you know everybody has a
limit

1021
01:02:36,790 --> 01:02:40,180
and what I was seeing was no

1022
01:02:40,180 --> 01:02:43,740
a few people have government and most of
them have

1023
01:02:43,740 --> 01:02:47,160
note that by the way as you said there's
no question at all times

1024
01:02:47,160 --> 01:02:50,380
there are people in the system who are
criticizing

1025
01:02:50,380 --> 01:02:53,380
were raising questions were even using
this is

1026
01:02:53,380 --> 01:02:56,440
wrong or what not up to a point as you
did

1027
01:02:56,440 --> 01:03:00,110
before you know you went all the way and
talk to other people

1028
01:03:00,110 --> 01:03:05,240
what their limit is going outside going
outside channels going to the public

1029
01:03:05,240 --> 01:03:06,240
going that moment

1030
01:03:06,240 --> 01:03:10,070
doesn't get across the taking a risk
even complaining or criticizing

1031
01:03:10,070 --> 01:03:13,420
some and the they may even lose our jobs
as result

1032
01:03:13,420 --> 01:03:19,010
I eventually but they get another job as
long as they haven't broken that promise

1033
01:03:19,010 --> 01:03:22,330
to keep their mouth shut about anything

1034
01:03:22,330 --> 01:03:25,660
see they can get another job they can be
trusted the

1035
01:03:25,660 --> 01:03:28,750
they will stay inside the system like
dreadful and wait

1036
01:03:28,750 --> 01:03:32,810
during the Vietnam War but they don't
I'm

1037
01:03:32,810 --> 01:03:36,090
so I i come to feel nobody apparently

1038
01:03:36,090 --> 01:03:39,970
know what it can do this I don't know or
it so necessary in it so obvious

1039
01:03:39,970 --> 01:03:44,120
the price %uh not doing it the price the
government achieving

1040
01:03:44,120 --> 01:03:47,870
total control total control I love

1041
01:03:47,870 --> 01:03:50,900
the embarrassing things in the plans are
going to

1042
01:03:50,900 --> 01:03:54,670
is Vietnam War and the Iraq war

1043
01:03:54,670 --> 01:03:58,460
the approach to climate we've had right
along

1044
01:03:58,460 --> 01:04:03,460
the nuclear weapons policies which are
incredibly reckless shame shame

1045
01:04:03,460 --> 01:04:07,240
Lee reckless that have gone on without
exposure from people inside

1046
01:04:07,240 --> 01:04:11,270
they don't have a limits or something
met you in Manning did show me

1047
01:04:11,270 --> 01:04:15,590
there are some people out there I've
always felt that they were more

1048
01:04:15,590 --> 01:04:19,970
who had the capability to cross that
line then we were seeing

1049
01:04:19,970 --> 01:04:23,600
and that you know the advantage and your
approach

1050
01:04:23,600 --> 01:04:26,730
is to make it less dangerous less risky

1051
01:04:26,730 --> 01:04:31,230
and I agree that's the central and can
be done and the people in this very room

1052
01:04:31,230 --> 01:04:34,830
are contributing to that encamped richer
as we

1053
01:04:34,830 --> 01:04:38,160
we were speaking last time you and me I
have

1054
01:04:38,160 --> 01:04:42,370
being not a technologist less optimism
about technology

1055
01:04:42,370 --> 01:04:46,090
then you have you know infinitely more
about it than I do but

1056
01:04:46,090 --> 01:04:49,600
I'm more than twice the age you are and

1057
01:04:49,600 --> 01:04:52,700
the future of Titanic's let's say is

1058
01:04:52,700 --> 01:04:56,160
is in my mind even though I that was
before me but

1059
01:04:56,160 --> 01:04:59,530
on the challenger for example and I
don't put my

1060
01:04:59,530 --> 01:05:02,940
I it's hard for me to believe that all
these people together

1061
01:05:02,940 --> 01:05:06,730
will make the process of telling
embarrassing things about

1062
01:05:06,730 --> 01:05:10,400
the government which is exactly what the
public needs to know to hold them

1063
01:05:10,400 --> 01:05:12,490
accountable to have an influence on
policy

1064
01:05:12,490 --> 01:05:15,980
that that can be made totally riskless

1065
01:05:15,980 --> 01:05:21,150
I think that there were there will
remain a risk of some kind and I think

1066
01:05:21,150 --> 01:05:23,300
that hurts and I don't think we're ever

1067
01:05:23,300 --> 01:05:27,440
you probably agree with that yeah
there's never going to be a holy

1068
01:05:27,440 --> 01:05:30,520
risk-free in but we can do is we can
mitigate

1069
01:05:30,520 --> 01:05:34,230
yep in britain trying to get a little
bit more available a little bit less

1070
01:05:34,230 --> 01:05:34,990
painful

1071
01:05:34,990 --> 01:05:38,170
ago arm and yup its

1072
01:05:38,170 --> 01:05:41,930
want to get one for your permission this
is crucial it's crucial that they do

1073
01:05:41,930 --> 01:05:43,450
that what you're saying is crucial

1074
01:05:43,450 --> 01:05:47,610
but i just want to put in a word for the
what I've been saying here

1075
01:05:47,610 --> 01:05:51,080
which is the hope that people like like
you

1076
01:05:51,080 --> 01:05:54,790
any other speaking out here timed recon
just one reader

1077
01:05:54,790 --> 01:05:59,490
and the other who have spoken the truth
that people can be inspired other

1078
01:05:59,490 --> 01:06:02,690
that they will be more

1079
01:06:02,690 --> 01:06:05,920
whistleblowing in there has been even
given

1080
01:06:05,920 --> 01:06:09,030
risk and you know I was

1081
01:06:09,030 --> 01:06:12,690
handed him here we were coming in a

1082
01:06:12,690 --> 01:06:16,020
thing from expose fact which is a poster

1083
01:06:16,020 --> 01:06:20,060
that is I'll appearing in in Washington
right now

1084
01:06:20,060 --> 01:06:24,450
and it has a with my picture and has a
big headline

1085
01:06:24,450 --> 01:06:28,330
saying don't do what I did because

1086
01:06:28,330 --> 01:06:32,890
are I E for years

1087
01:06:32,890 --> 01:06:36,250
didn't want to talk about people I
talked about civil disobedience in the

1088
01:06:36,250 --> 01:06:39,000
need to do in connection with nuclear
things in order

1089
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:42,890
gotten arrested more than a few times
over and i won people generally did not

1090
01:06:42,890 --> 01:06:43,740
have

1091
01:06:43,740 --> 01:06:48,000
access to classified information so I
wasn't talking to people who

1092
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:51,010
had their taxes journey they won't let
me talk to them

1093
01:06:51,010 --> 01:06:54,450
and the anyway getting audience here and
so

1094
01:06:54,450 --> 01:06:58,130
I didn't want to say you should be
whistleblowers

1095
01:06:58,130 --> 01:07:02,310
because it sounded too much like saying
do what i do. in that same self

1096
01:07:02,310 --> 01:07:06,370
self-promoting and then I thought it was
a

1097
01:07:06,370 --> 01:07:09,770
with the recording on that poster a new
way to put it

1098
01:07:09,770 --> 01:07:13,130
don't you way to war

1099
01:07:13,130 --> 01:07:17,780
his started don't wait till thousands
more have died

1100
01:07:17,780 --> 01:07:21,530
before you tell the truth with documents

1101
01:07:21,530 --> 01:07:25,240
and it doesn't say it on the sign but he
said even at personal cost

1102
01:07:25,240 --> 01:07:28,390
even interpersonal risk that people
should see

1103
01:07:28,390 --> 01:07:32,520
yes you're not in prison but you are an
exile

1104
01:07:32,520 --> 01:07:36,600
and probably I have to say I see very
sadly I think

1105
01:07:36,600 --> 01:07:40,220
indefinitely I don't do not see this
congress

1106
01:07:40,220 --> 01:07:43,360
and a in any future president to this
one

1107
01:07:43,360 --> 01:07:49,680
changing the law and they should
rescinding paragraph Eve 18 USC 793

1108
01:07:49,680 --> 01:07:52,860
which should be rescinded as
unconstitutional I don't think that's

1109
01:07:52,860 --> 01:07:53,700
going to happen

1110
01:07:53,700 --> 01:07:58,270
and that means you couldn't come back
and have a fair trial

1111
01:07:58,270 --> 01:08:02,040
ever I that I really foresee in this
country

1112
01:08:02,040 --> 01:08:05,820
I'll in other countries that they may
change our laws that's in process the

1113
01:08:05,820 --> 01:08:07,820
following a public interest defence

1114
01:08:07,820 --> 01:08:11,810
and allowing an argument but I and I
would love to see that in this country

1115
01:08:11,810 --> 01:08:15,290
but I don't see it happening so that
means you have a fellow

1116
01:08:15,290 --> 01:08:18,370
for many people that could be a negative
well look

1117
01:08:18,370 --> 01:08:22,440
he did it and picture telling us to do
can come back to his own country

1118
01:08:22,440 --> 01:08:26,700
what the fact is you shold first of all
you're not in prison

1119
01:08:26,700 --> 01:08:30,019
if you came back here as you know and I
know

1120
01:08:30,020 --> 01:08:33,440
you would not be able to talk to the
public

1121
01:08:33,440 --> 01:08:36,880
make your case to the public the way
carry and

1122
01:08:36,880 --> 01:08:40,030
weaken ever juju Henry actually said

1123
01:08:40,030 --> 01:08:43,960
make your case to the public which
actually affects the legal

1124
01:08:43,960 --> 01:08:48,140
all ship you would be in an isolation
cell like Chelsea manning up for two and

1125
01:08:48,140 --> 01:08:48,810
a half months

1126
01:08:48,810 --> 01:08:51,810
but for the rest of your life I believe
from the moment you

1127
01:08:51,810 --> 01:08:55,460
you were arrested so you could not make
your case the way you can

1128
01:08:55,460 --> 01:08:59,250
in are going for the whole world right
now so it's essential

1129
01:08:59,250 --> 01:09:02,690
it was I said this reason it is
essential for you to be out of the

1130
01:09:02,690 --> 01:09:04,090
country

1131
01:09:04,090 --> 01:09:08,080
when you major revelations was another
difference people said well dan ellsberg

1132
01:09:08,080 --> 01:09:08,720
say

1133
01:09:08,720 --> 01:09:14,900
faces for all the whole thing altogether
but you could I was able to speak

1134
01:09:14,900 --> 01:09:18,220
demonstrations the interviews everything
as you're doing now from outside the

1135
01:09:18,220 --> 01:09:19,120
country

1136
01:09:19,120 --> 01:09:22,580
inside the country even while the FBI

1137
01:09:22,580 --> 01:09:25,870
was looking for me I was on walter
cronkite

1138
01:09:25,870 --> 01:09:30,190
in the evening I even using an
undisclosed location

1139
01:09:30,190 --> 01:09:34,280
in Cambridge we've gotten very excited

1140
01:09:34,280 --> 01:09:38,890
an internal here either I am the the
FBI's with 30 the world

1141
01:09:38,890 --> 01:09:42,750
and I'm on evening news well you are too

1142
01:09:42,750 --> 01:09:46,460
but you had to be out of the country and
was essential that the people hear from

1143
01:09:46,460 --> 01:09:47,200
you

1144
01:09:47,200 --> 01:09:50,279
so what I'm saying people can look at
him saying

1145
01:09:50,280 --> 01:09:54,690
here is a guy who understood that it was
worth taking a risk

1146
01:09:54,690 --> 01:09:58,850
worth risking in even sacrificing
personal relationships

1147
01:09:58,850 --> 01:10:04,280
on so great you're her father was able
to go to Russia and see you but you know

1148
01:10:04,280 --> 01:10:07,500
if you if you're in a situation so not
so much you know

1149
01:10:07,500 --> 01:10:11,270
so Chelsea Manning has never been
interview

1150
01:10:11,270 --> 01:10:15,190
by reporters from the time she was
arrested in kuwait into

1151
01:10:15,190 --> 01:10:18,770
no reporter has been able to see her
face to face

1152
01:10:18,770 --> 01:10:21,960
and talk to her will you have the you
would have the same

1153
01:10:21,960 --> 01:10:25,350
prospect and it's worth it

1154
01:10:25,350 --> 01:10:29,450
you did the right thing I don't even
have to ask you whether you regret

1155
01:10:29,450 --> 01:10:33,000
paying this price I can't even imagine
you know wouldn't hurt you

1156
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:37,240
I never met a person who went to prison
against the draft

1157
01:10:37,240 --> 01:10:42,700
against the war and all other who
inspired me to give the Pentagon Papers

1158
01:10:42,700 --> 01:10:46,940
I don't know why I'm whoever told me
they were granted 23

1159
01:10:46,940 --> 01:10:50,770
years in prison thanks man so that's an
example

1160
01:10:50,770 --> 01:10:54,790
it has to be seen yes lower the risks

1161
01:10:54,790 --> 01:11:00,330
also get the message out it's worth
taking the risk awards with a lives may

1162
01:11:00,330 --> 01:11:01,140
be at stake

1163
01:11:01,140 --> 01:11:08,140
in our democracy in your case is that
state thank you

1164
01:11:15,430 --> 01:11:19,620
and one their their couple things I
could

1165
01:11:19,620 --> 01:11:22,980
saying on that just real quickly because
I I think we're running down on time

1166
01:11:22,980 --> 01:11:27,820
but the we had an extra twenty minutes L

1167
01:11:27,820 --> 01:11:31,400
ok keep talking we can go to a

1168
01:11:31,400 --> 01:11:35,350
we got a 50 okay

1169
01:11:35,350 --> 01:11:41,870
arm there's a lot

1170
01:11:41,870 --> 01:11:47,670
I'll one of the things which you touch
on patriotism

1171
01:11:47,670 --> 01:11:51,360
a little better and I think everybody in
this room

1172
01:11:51,360 --> 01:11:55,270
would agree you know most most the time
people who attend her conferences are

1173
01:11:55,270 --> 01:12:00,490
marks last my but geena Petri

1174
01:12:00,490 --> 01:12:03,900
doesn't move you know obedience

1175
01:12:03,900 --> 01:12:08,650
to putting aside

1176
01:12:08,650 --> 01:12:12,110
your obligations to your people to your
country

1177
01:12:12,110 --> 01:12:15,260
for the benefit of your government is
the office

1178
01:12:15,260 --> 01:12:19,270
pic is oaths to it or

1179
01:12:19,270 --> 01:12:22,710
I want most dangerous & Co Roces things

1180
01:12:22,710 --> 01:12:27,820
a person to greet you in society and
culture around what we

1181
01:12:27,820 --> 01:12:32,080
require I'll what we should

1182
01:12:32,080 --> 01:12:35,380
which are oaths now

1183
01:12:35,380 --> 01:12:40,940
its my like our Constitution she didn't
want us to stand up for our Constitution

1184
01:12:40,940 --> 01:12:41,340
say

1185
01:12:41,340 --> 01:12:46,770
you guys this is most ridiculous shit I
have ever seen you know you're smiling

1186
01:12:46,770 --> 01:12:50,370
everybody in the country and everybody
world you not even bothered

1187
01:12:50,370 --> 01:12:54,920
querer real means your secret arm

1188
01:12:54,920 --> 01:12:58,400
you not only brings

1189
01:12:58,400 --> 01:13:01,770
now initially expect us

1190
01:13:01,770 --> 01:13:06,210
to do that if they expect us to stay
site

1191
01:13:06,210 --> 01:13:10,450
in the face extraordinary masses
widespread violations of the

1192
01:13:10,450 --> 01:13:11,430
Constitution

1193
01:13:11,430 --> 01:13:15,630
they shouldn't ask us to take the oath
first place you know because the nazis

1194
01:13:15,630 --> 01:13:22,260
are there is there something else

1195
01:13:22,260 --> 01:13:26,340
you mention their moms actually a really
short work members are completely lost I

1196
01:13:26,340 --> 01:13:27,270
was thinking

1197
01:13:27,270 --> 01:13:32,680
year Swiper you're too young tender to
your

1198
01:13:32,680 --> 01:13:36,680
I a lifetime

1199
01:13:36,680 --> 01:13:43,340
means law yes things like that will do
that I guess

1200
01:13:43,340 --> 01:13:49,430
child on the Internet but really it's
how we come together

1201
01:13:49,430 --> 01:13:53,430
we fix the problem right we we know what
we have but the key is you talk about

1202
01:13:53,430 --> 01:13:54,400
the way things are

1203
01:13:54,400 --> 01:13:57,830
you talked about the system we have
today you talked about the

1204
01:13:57,830 --> 01:14:03,170
proclivities almost use or protect their
own interests to the detriment

1205
01:14:03,170 --> 01:14:06,870
up the people to the detriment of their
own homes to the judgment

1206
01:14:06,870 --> 01:14:11,160
themselves the second come because
comfort is a tremendous

1207
01:14:11,160 --> 01:14:15,250
you know more than when we talk about
hun captures in on the Internet

1208
01:14:15,250 --> 01:14:19,970
home it sounds stupid but we loved ones
you know the the mean a lot to us

1209
01:14:19,970 --> 01:14:23,260
but the key is when we talk about
government

1210
01:14:23,260 --> 01:14:27,250
saldovar you know again a attacking the
hypervisor

1211
01:14:27,250 --> 01:14:31,050
our democracy getting out there and you
know it it's changing domain

1212
01:14:31,050 --> 01:14:34,410
the boundaries our rights without
telling us about

1213
01:14:34,410 --> 01:14:37,650
if they can do it to the fourth in the
system and they can do in

1214
01:14:37,650 --> 01:14:40,950
right you may say I'll X

1215
01:14:40,950 --> 01:14:44,670
don't care about spun recommend spying
on me its gonna

1216
01:14:44,670 --> 01:14:49,360
right when you see when you see

1217
01:14:49,360 --> 01:14:52,610
not just the Prince's but the wrongs

1218
01:14:52,610 --> 01:14:55,660
that are in here you initial make
apartments

1219
01:14:55,660 --> 01:14:58,830
okay these are rights that are in here
my nature

1220
01:14:58,830 --> 01:15:02,230
these are writes that long to human
condition he's a rights third

1221
01:15:02,230 --> 01:15:07,500
deepened up and the kids were peeled
back in time you never did it was that

1222
01:15:07,500 --> 01:15:11,210
it's gonna get worse arm the founding
father said

1223
01:15:11,210 --> 01:15:14,690
people yet the government desert
newspeople

1224
01:15:14,690 --> 01:15:18,040
aren't willing to stand up people
willing to take yes

1225
01:15:18,040 --> 01:15:22,870
to reveal long even if it means they
have to burn their own life

1226
01:15:22,870 --> 01:15:27,130
their families you know their their
children

1227
01:15:27,130 --> 01:15:30,770
descent and everybody after us the
values that they hold dear will

1228
01:15:30,770 --> 01:15:31,510
disappear

1229
01:15:31,510 --> 01:15:36,620
world and we all inability to push back
against

1230
01:15:36,620 --> 01:15:40,560
we all have you to contribute you know

1231
01:15:40,560 --> 01:15:43,920
in that the open source movement is a
great example of this

1232
01:15:43,920 --> 01:15:47,390
but it's not limited a problem its

1233
01:15:47,390 --> 01:15:50,400
no politics is the way we miss the way
we talk to our hearts

1234
01:15:50,400 --> 01:15:53,620
when we talk Orton's we have the ability
to build

1235
01:15:53,620 --> 01:15:57,170
and more almost there just society every

1236
01:15:57,170 --> 01:16:00,980
and even technologies dangerous and
destabilizing

1237
01:16:00,980 --> 01:16:05,250
when we don't think about when this
before when we think about increase in

1238
01:16:05,250 --> 01:16:08,520
robot is a she workforce

1239
01:16:08,520 --> 01:16:11,710
the fact we have young people who have
tremendous

1240
01:16:11,710 --> 01:16:16,860
student debt never been result that's
not dischargeable

1241
01:16:16,860 --> 01:16:20,340
bankruptcy proceedings thanks government
without arm

1242
01:16:20,340 --> 01:16:25,010
we have a new class that our intentions

1243
01:16:25,010 --> 01:16:29,200
I in a very new and modern way that's
for corrosive

1244
01:16:29,200 --> 01:16:32,460
to the sort to Gallatin deals

1245
01:16:32,460 --> 01:16:36,650
that we as Americans aspired whole

1246
01:16:36,650 --> 01:16:39,880
and if we don't take chains don't take

1247
01:16:39,880 --> 01:16:43,510
risks to push back and say more

1248
01:16:43,510 --> 01:16:47,450
we have a place missus we have in place
in this world

1249
01:16:47,450 --> 01:16:50,450
you guys them are not gonna represent

1250
01:16:50,450 --> 01:16:54,760
public's interest you can represent who
you can represent

1251
01:16:54,760 --> 01:16:58,280
you can represent class interests

1252
01:16:58,280 --> 01:17:01,380
exclusive to the detriment

1253
01:17:01,380 --> 01:17:04,640
the left or that coochie in that seat

1254
01:17:04,640 --> 01:17:08,630
we're going to bill new site Ranjan

1255
01:17:08,630 --> 01:17:11,730
and thanks to the same technology that's

1256
01:17:11,730 --> 01:17:15,060
lead us in many ways we are now in power

1257
01:17:15,060 --> 01:17:19,110
in New its you know when we when we talk
about all these things will talk about

1258
01:17:19,110 --> 01:17:19,680
massive

1259
01:17:19,680 --> 01:17:22,690
announce when we talk about the fact
that you know

1260
01:17:22,690 --> 01:17:26,650
we've got its famous inquisitors in
history it said give me six lines

1261
01:17:26,650 --> 01:17:30,820
written by the hand at the most honest
man must find something to hang him with

1262
01:17:30,820 --> 01:17:35,190
no we're not talking about and positions
from medieval times were talking about

1263
01:17:35,190 --> 01:17:37,210
Keith Alexander

1264
01:17:37,210 --> 01:17:41,520
not and its up to us to change that
because we can revoke

1265
01:17:41,520 --> 01:17:45,860
that homes on we can try democratic
BodySpace

1266
01:17:45,860 --> 01:17:49,590
now if they say you're gonna exclude you
on that day

1267
01:17:49,590 --> 01:17:52,760
if we're going to exclude you from those
discussions if we're gonna

1268
01:17:52,760 --> 01:17:56,190
play games like they're doing the UK
when the past are

1269
01:17:56,190 --> 01:17:59,800
an extraordinary expansion span one
spouse just last week

1270
01:17:59,800 --> 01:18:04,060
under the guise emergency law when
they've been ignoring the emergency last

1271
01:18:04,060 --> 01:18:05,760
year

1272
01:18:05,760 --> 01:18:09,420
arm we have not just

1273
01:18:09,420 --> 01:18:12,540
the capability but we haven't

1274
01:18:12,540 --> 01:18:16,030
obligation to push back against

1275
01:18:16,030 --> 01:18:23,030
to Creekside what

1276
01:18:28,030 --> 01:18:32,260
so easily with government which
questions

1277
01:18:32,260 --> 01:18:36,060
so we'll have about two minutes left I'm
do each if you want to take a minute

1278
01:18:36,060 --> 01:18:39,310
to on address each other or

1279
01:18:39,310 --> 01:18:44,800
address the audience

1280
01:18:44,800 --> 01:18:49,520
we we really do agree fundamentally your
because you talk about

1281
01:18:49,520 --> 01:18:52,980
talk about bypassing the people who
don't take risks in the government

1282
01:18:52,980 --> 01:18:56,330
building a new technology I just wanna
say that

1283
01:18:56,330 --> 01:19:00,820
to will take risks in other words people
as we know from Aaron Swartz's we know

1284
01:19:00,820 --> 01:19:02,360
from the others

1285
01:19:02,360 --> 01:19:05,229
who've gone down here basically

1286
01:19:05,229 --> 01:19:08,989
German him the other the and Tom Drake
who tried to do this

1287
01:19:08,989 --> 01:19:13,209
and very gerd we be in for

1288
01:19:13,209 --> 01:19:17,889
tried within channels dual there is risk
even if you don't get prosecuted

1289
01:19:17,889 --> 01:19:22,360
if you can so people will have to be
willing in all the serbs even here

1290
01:19:22,360 --> 01:19:27,149
even here it will people take risk
possible you remember

1291
01:19:27,149 --> 01:19:31,059
tundra yesterday just what we talk about
it you when I talk a lot about the

1292
01:19:31,059 --> 01:19:31,999
Constitution

1293
01:19:31,999 --> 01:19:35,419
and rights jewel that's not

1294
01:19:35,419 --> 01:19:39,300
in the end that's not the beginning in
and up the problem here

1295
01:19:39,300 --> 01:19:42,689
after all the Constitution or thrice
slavery

1296
01:19:42,689 --> 01:19:47,300
for a long time the Fugitive Slave Act
was upheld by the Supreme Court

1297
01:19:47,300 --> 01:19:51,550
and the people who violated that a great
risk we're doing the right thing

1298
01:19:51,550 --> 01:19:56,070
rosa parks are refused to sit together
for mercy

1299
01:19:56,070 --> 01:20:00,289
she was violating in in Montgomery
Alabama she was driving along urban

1300
01:20:00,289 --> 01:20:03,379
upheld by the Alabama Supreme Court

1301
01:20:03,379 --> 01:20:06,769
if thats modern oxymoron sometime but
the

1302
01:20:06,769 --> 01:20:10,090
on the fact was once civil disobedience

1303
01:20:10,090 --> 01:20:13,099
was mister if they change the law

1304
01:20:13,099 --> 01:20:18,360
or I should say if the Supreme Court up
holes for the first time

1305
01:20:18,360 --> 01:20:23,530
it's never addressed this question the
espionage her with its strict liability

1306
01:20:23,530 --> 01:20:26,769
with its no public interest no not

1307
01:20:26,769 --> 01:20:30,829
without any the changes that are
necessary in if they are poll that and

1308
01:20:30,829 --> 01:20:34,079
say its constitution we would've lost
pretty much over First Amendment

1309
01:20:34,079 --> 01:20:37,780
and without the first commander in the
fourth amendment and other things

1310
01:20:37,780 --> 01:20:41,379
and that will have to be violated at
that point

1311
01:20:41,379 --> 01:20:45,249
will have to be civil disobedience at
that point in the supreme court will

1312
01:20:45,249 --> 01:20:45,979
said

1313
01:20:45,979 --> 01:20:49,929
5 a.m. maybe more maybe six will have
said

1314
01:20:49,929 --> 01:20:54,229
its constitutional to allow for
government solely by

1315
01:20:54,229 --> 01:20:58,519
him down and one journalist will live
with that michael kinsley and David

1316
01:20:58,519 --> 01:21:00,030
Gregory will take their handouts

1317
01:21:00,030 --> 01:21:03,110
are with with no problem allow the the
government

1318
01:21:03,110 --> 01:21:07,229
to have the last word as to whether
something should be redacted or not

1319
01:21:07,229 --> 01:21:10,780
they'll still be newspapers as in China

1320
01:21:10,780 --> 01:21:14,590
but the fact is we will have lost the
independent branches

1321
01:21:14,590 --> 01:21:17,760
we don't have much in congress now or in
the courts

1322
01:21:17,760 --> 01:21:21,219
but something with will have lost the
ability to rebuild their

1323
01:21:21,219 --> 01:21:24,800
and the affect will be say more

1324
01:21:24,800 --> 01:21:27,820
unnecessary wrongful wars handle

1325
01:21:27,820 --> 01:21:31,359
so more climate deprivation and so forth

1326
01:21:31,359 --> 01:21:34,919
so we need more people like you was I
keep saying

1327
01:21:34,919 --> 01:21:39,369
many others but also people who were
less courageous if I may say but who are

1328
01:21:39,369 --> 01:21:40,169
willing to take

1329
01:21:40,169 --> 01:21:44,129
some risk and to discover that there are
limits

1330
01:21:44,129 --> 01:21:47,709
to what they will put up with that in
this audience and Amin

1331
01:21:47,709 --> 01:21:52,599
government and they will quickly find if
they ask that question that there are

1332
01:21:52,599 --> 01:21:53,169
limits

1333
01:21:53,169 --> 01:21:56,249
and I should be willing to take a risk
they'll discover what I

1334
01:21:56,249 --> 01:22:00,719
discovered in 1969 the government is
gone

1335
01:22:00,719 --> 01:22:04,289
beyond those limits for me and they have
to be explored

1336
01:22:04,289 --> 01:22:07,859
and with that I think we'll be right
there

1337
01:22:07,859 --> 01:22:10,939
will be hard to find the limit if you
start asking yourself whether there is a

1338
01:22:10,939 --> 01:22:11,349
limit

1339
01:22:11,349 --> 01:22:15,769
mother should go across a edge in any
closing thoughts

1340
01:22:15,769 --> 01:22:18,800
at are just real quickly

1341
01:22:18,800 --> 01:22:22,189
look around everybody

1342
01:22:22,189 --> 01:22:25,379
whose in this from

1343
01:22:25,379 --> 01:22:29,639
run and recognize that weaker broad
cross-section

1344
01:22:29,639 --> 01:22:33,050
people who are thinking about these
issues working on these issues affect

1345
01:22:33,050 --> 01:22:36,359
issues there are people from the NSA in
this one

1346
01:22:36,359 --> 01:22:40,599
right now you know they they pay travel
hostile conferences in

1347
01:22:40,599 --> 01:22:44,340
my min people who go and read a little
ports in the share

1348
01:22:44,340 --> 01:22:47,689
everybody else go to different tracks
they make sure they see all the fun

1349
01:22:47,689 --> 01:22:48,309
starts

1350
01:22:48,309 --> 01:22:53,479
arm put the keys even for you got to
work for the NSA who were in the room

1351
01:22:53,479 --> 01:22:57,519
much longer to do I'm not telling you
what to believe in

1352
01:22:57,519 --> 01:23:01,389
you know and its okay if you can it's
okay if you disagree with me

1353
01:23:01,389 --> 01:23:04,739
it's okay for everybody you know

1354
01:23:04,739 --> 01:23:08,399
to look at this because we have to
decide how we feel

1355
01:23:08,399 --> 01:23:11,619
right we gotta stop honking that what's
on the news

1356
01:23:11,619 --> 01:23:14,649
is the gospel truth once she says behind
dunno

1357
01:23:14,649 --> 01:23:18,800
poem is exactly the right answer what I
say something that you hear a lot of I

1358
01:23:18,800 --> 01:23:20,419
could be totally fall she

1359
01:23:20,419 --> 01:23:23,629
you gotta figure out what you believe in

1360
01:23:23,629 --> 01:23:26,769
in Staines word you have to stand

1361
01:23:26,769 --> 01:23:29,949
for you now and whether I'm a good guy

1362
01:23:29,949 --> 01:23:33,099
weatherman whether I'm here or whether a
traitor

1363
01:23:33,099 --> 01:23:36,689
none of that matters criticizing he

1364
01:23:36,689 --> 01:23:39,929
I think about what matters in issues

1365
01:23:39,929 --> 01:23:44,269
run think about the world you want to
learn nanoparticles

1366
01:23:44,269 --> 01:23:48,899
I could ask you to do one thing thank
you to everybody

1367
01:23:48,899 --> 01:23:55,899
on and thank you panels for everything
the

1368
01:24:09,130 --> 01:24:14,260
thank you

1369
01:24:14,260 --> 01:24:21,260
the I can hear the whistle really well
