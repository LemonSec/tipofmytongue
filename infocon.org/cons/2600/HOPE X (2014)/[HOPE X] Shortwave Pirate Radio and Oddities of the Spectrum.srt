the plan

6
00:00:41,870 --> 00:00:48,870
yes

7
00:00:55,810 --> 00:00:57,370

gatens considered to be a greetings and
thanks for coming to her backs

14
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:38,200
I'll there's this talk shortwave pirate
radio and

15
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:42,820
an autism spectrum is a I think it line
with some of the other stuff at her

16
00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:43,450
because

17
00:01:43,450 --> 00:01:47,490
we cover the oddities that each second
here at a conference

18
00:01:47,490 --> 00:01:52,070
I've known Andy order for a long time
he's written several books about a

19
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:56,220
are sure a pirate radio and is just an
overall a really nice guy

20
00:01:56,220 --> 00:01:59,570
and is extremely knowledgeable about
this topic

21
00:01:59,570 --> 00:02:04,770
and I'm really pleased he came to her
back she came to hope ten years ago

22
00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:08,840
and I finally after many years is August
all the planets lined up for him to come

23
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:12,290
so I wanted to do so my friend anti
odour

24
00:02:12,290 --> 00:02:18,510
aunts

25
00:02:18,510 --> 00:02:22,400
I guess first question I have is how
many people

26
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:26,519
listening to short wave radio were have
really wasn't a shortwave radio

27
00:02:26,519 --> 00:02:30,220
Cape a good many more than a

28
00:02:30,220 --> 00:02:33,549
meant more than I thought and maybe a
little bit more than I planned for

29
00:02:33,549 --> 00:02:36,560
arm I have far this is kind of a

30
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:41,900
a basic presentation on short by radio
and hopefully of for those of you who

31
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:46,110
are maybe have listened to a lot of
short wave were a lot of pirates in the

32
00:02:46,110 --> 00:02:46,690
past

33
00:02:46,690 --> 00:02:51,190
our wall wall law bear with it and it
won't be too

34
00:02:51,190 --> 00:02:54,970
too much information the you already
know about so

35
00:02:54,970 --> 00:02:58,380
are of course my goal with this
presentation is to

36
00:02:58,380 --> 00:03:02,120
I educate you about a topic that I've
been interested in

37
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:06,480
and I find fascinating and I try to be a
lease a little bit entertaining

38
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:10,030
by to really I pay public speaking

39
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:13,519
and my real goal is just to get through
this without lining up on a

40
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:17,970
YouTube ultimate fails compilation so

41
00:03:17,970 --> 00:03:22,269
I thought the best way to start with the
talk on my radio would be to start with

42
00:03:22,269 --> 00:03:25,480
what got me interested in in the topic
to begin with

43
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:29,209
and I did a test run on this
presentation last night

44
00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:32,889
and my wife and and daughter said that

45
00:03:32,889 --> 00:03:36,100
are need to let you know that I have

46
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:41,090
lock lips and stuff coming and it's not
just some my experiences from when I was

47
00:03:41,090 --> 00:03:41,690
a

48
00:03:41,690 --> 00:03:47,070
like thirteen years old but my first
encounter with my radio occurred when I

49
00:03:47,070 --> 00:03:47,980
was 13

50
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:52,100
are my mom took me to the Brandon mall
for my birthday

51
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:55,660
and was the first one in the area so was
like and new big thing

52
00:03:55,660 --> 00:03:59,850
I was looking through the magazine's
walton's I found one of the last issues

53
00:03:59,850 --> 00:04:01,970
a vast nine before they went belly-up

54
00:04:01,970 --> 00:04:06,280
s9 was a CB magazine that took off
during the trucker craze in the

55
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:07,060
seventies

56
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:11,440
and I it was on its death throes
whenever when everyone had finally

57
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:14,720
gotten tired of saying goodbye to you
and talking about smokey's

58
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:17,980
arm become much %uh visit

59
00:04:17,980 --> 00:04:21,489
CB material in an effort to stay afloat
by that point

60
00:04:21,489 --> 00:04:25,770
are among the new material was a column
on shortwave higher radio

61
00:04:25,770 --> 00:04:30,050
I saw a radio cars from pirate stations
around the united states and read about

62
00:04:30,050 --> 00:04:33,430
stations like the boys at the pyramids
radio Indiana

63
00:04:33,430 --> 00:04:37,190
thank Arky and stuff that I just didn't
really

64
00:04:37,190 --> 00:04:40,330
would have I wouldn't have expected
would have existed because

65
00:04:40,330 --> 00:04:45,160
I just assume that you throw a station
on the air and start broadcasting and

66
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:48,520
some is going to show up at your door to
close it down

67
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:51,600
but that wasn't quite the case sad
lovers

68
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:56,320
the idea that these mystery stations run
year I in spite of the government agents

69
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:58,020
are out there trying to close it down

70
00:04:58,020 --> 00:05:02,669
one of my best friends got a hella
crafters SX 28 a receiver

71
00:05:02,669 --> 00:05:07,770
and now is a sixty five-pound tube radio
was used on AB ship San in

72
00:05:07,770 --> 00:05:12,510
SEC monitoring stations during world war
2 we sit around in his basement

73
00:05:12,510 --> 00:05:15,680
and listen to international broadcasters
and talk about

74
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:20,360
I radio stations I had a Zenith am/fm
radio

75
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:24,310
has just one ones like a tabletop that
you have in your kitchen

76
00:05:24,310 --> 00:05:27,880
but I was impatient to hear shortwave on
my own radio

77
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:31,820
I I don't know where I read this but I
read somewhere

78
00:05:31,820 --> 00:05:38,039
arm at that radio tuning was controlled
by the capacitances the tuning capacitor

79
00:05:38,039 --> 00:05:42,000
so I thought maybe if I could just
change the value the capacitor

80
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,090
that I can get Roy decisions on my AM
radio

81
00:05:45,090 --> 00:05:49,400
which again since Tom but here's my
warning

82
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:53,050
do not do this do not try this at home

83
00:05:53,050 --> 00:05:58,000
I basically this was a sad this is so
stupid it might just work scenario

84
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:02,680
and I G and a screwdriver blade into
different areas are the tuning capacitor

85
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:05,729
some more than once I hit the wrong wire

86
00:06:05,729 --> 00:06:08,979
and shot blue sparks across a the floor

87
00:06:08,979 --> 00:06:13,389
but when I hit the right place IQ here
international broadcasters

88
00:06:13,389 --> 00:06:17,409
mixed in with ham stations and then when
I hit a different place

89
00:06:17,409 --> 00:06:21,729
over it was a short wave stations I
didn't have a good way to

90
00:06:21,729 --> 00:06:25,620
dick hold the screwdriver in place so
it's kinda hell did

91
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:29,189
upside listen late at night with an
internal wire in my mouth

92
00:06:29,189 --> 00:06:32,150
and

93
00:06:32,150 --> 00:06:36,159
because I didn't have a good at tennis I
was using myself as as an antenna

94
00:06:36,159 --> 00:06:39,800
trying to get the best signal while
holding the screwdriver in place

95
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:45,409
I with us wholesale health hazard
shortwave system I heard radio moscow

96
00:06:45,409 --> 00:06:48,539
Anna the voice America

97
00:06:48,539 --> 00:06:52,060
up BBC voice of Nigeria

98
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:56,069
radio peaking and many more legal
stations a but I still hadn't heard any

99
00:06:56,069 --> 00:06:56,750
pirates

100
00:06:56,750 --> 00:07:00,500
eventually I saved up enough money to
get my and receiver

101
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:05,139
and I was able to CIR start seriously
listening took a few map months if

102
00:07:05,139 --> 00:07:06,509
checking around the band's

103
00:07:06,509 --> 00:07:11,020
and getting my parents on things but
when I heard my first pirate W REM

104
00:07:11,020 --> 00:07:14,030
and 1983 I was pretty exciting

105
00:07:14,030 --> 00:07:17,419
the second pair that I heard was Raider
Klan sign

106
00:07:17,419 --> 00:07:20,659
they were station with her a big signal

107
00:07:20,659 --> 00:07:24,449
that they were kinda play a professional
sounding

108
00:07:24,449 --> 00:07:29,810
underground seventies rock station on
radio clan sign claim to be broadcasting

109
00:07:29,810 --> 00:07:32,039
from board a ship in international
waters

110
00:07:32,039 --> 00:07:35,860
they had a big signal in North America
and they like to track

111
00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:40,789
transmit hour-long shows right after a
licensure way station with sign of

112
00:07:40,789 --> 00:07:45,759
so enmeshed right in with all of the
licensed international station since

113
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:49,770
it surprised a lot listeners because
they thought they were listening to

114
00:07:49,770 --> 00:07:53,839
you know maybe Radio Prague or something
and here was really a clan sign

115
00:07:53,839 --> 00:07:57,789
so I have today an audio clip

116
00:07:57,789 --> 00:08:01,520
freighter clan sign in here is a letter
from the station

117
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:08,520
that I received back in eighty three and
I need to get this

118
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:13,169
at three this is

119
00:08:13,169 --> 00:08:17,050
state Radio Club state

120
00:08:17,050 --> 00:08:21,180
tejan flash file should be most musical
enjoyment for you

121
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:25,310
she snaps you feature

122
00:08:25,310 --> 00:08:29,069
this artists just from you

123
00:08:29,069 --> 00:08:36,069
like radio station the deal plan to stop
by

124
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:42,680
it

125
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:45,500
another the first pirates and I heard
was KPRC

126
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:50,180
and they operate on sixteen 16 killer
hurts just above the AM by

127
00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:53,210
die out the time has since changed and
now

128
00:08:53,210 --> 00:08:58,840
the top would be more like seventeen tan
KPRC broadcast the talk-show format with

129
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:03,910
liberal politics and masa Collins
through a variety of telco luv numbers

130
00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:07,440
which I'm sure would interests a lot
other people here hope

131
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:11,980
KPRC was raided by the SEC in the spring
in 1984

132
00:09:11,980 --> 00:09:14,990
at that time it was discovered that the
pyre was

133
00:09:14,990 --> 00:09:19,140
operating from the facilities are wooz I
WCW

134
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:22,310
which was a license station in
Monticello main

135
00:09:22,310 --> 00:09:26,580
arm they would what would happen was the
station personnel would

136
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:30,150
shut down the station for the night at
midnight and then they would connect

137
00:09:30,150 --> 00:09:35,550
a world war two era military surplus BC
610 transmitter to the station Santana

138
00:09:35,550 --> 00:09:38,980
and would broadcast a an hour to per
month

139
00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:42,260
or I mean a sorry I a broadcaster 2 per
month often

140
00:09:42,260 --> 00:09:46,870
those shows would run maybe four hours
and we do that after they would sign of

141
00:09:46,870 --> 00:09:51,210
sign waste license station off for the
night unfortunately I have some

142
00:09:51,210 --> 00:09:55,050
I do have some audio from KPRC that are
reported but

143
00:09:55,050 --> 00:09:59,850
the signals were too good because our
I'm from western Pennsylvania and

144
00:09:59,850 --> 00:10:03,810
the signal from are the very tip main
was a great into

145
00:10:03,810 --> 00:10:07,820
are into Western PA but

146
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:12,450
I have a different station that also
broadcast from right around the same

147
00:10:12,450 --> 00:10:13,160
time

148
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:17,200
a station that I heard a little bit
later a called the beauty axe

149
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:20,380
and the were thought to be from the New
York City area

150
00:10:20,380 --> 00:10:24,000
and they also featured a lot of art

151
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:29,000
telephone call-ins by Taco who and this
is our

152
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,620
the PDX from this was from my January

153
00:10:32,620 --> 00:10:39,620
love 1984 do

154
00:10:42,050 --> 00:10:46,140
you many may show me to listeners every
ever

155
00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:50,430
why you play VB your music I my

156
00:10:50,430 --> 00:10:54,850
deliberately anywhere hiring Jack at
midnight mister

157
00:10:54,850 --> 00:11:00,310
gardeners are made on the Dr Harry Reid
call-in show which runs our audience

158
00:11:00,310 --> 00:11:01,710
express their feelings and

159
00:11:01,710 --> 00:11:04,860
good

160
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:08,910
do I find more information or QSL card

161
00:11:08,910 --> 00:11:12,560
send a self-addressed do W

162
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:19,300
great and I was recording that I may
just on a boom box with

163
00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:22,770
the I'll with the lube n tan inside it
was in any

164
00:11:22,770 --> 00:11:26,250
Ste it was in any special or radio
system so

165
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:30,210
as you can see they had really pretty
good signal into western Pennsylvania

166
00:11:30,210 --> 00:11:34,720
at that time on

167
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:37,910
again for me was really cool to hear
these stations I would

168
00:11:37,910 --> 00:11:42,330
I after like a late night love listening
to them i woulda

169
00:11:42,330 --> 00:11:46,300
excitedly told my friends next day about
old stuff that I heard him

170
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:50,130
and you know wondering what was going on
behind the scenes have all this

171
00:11:50,130 --> 00:11:54,960
on and even that's a thing even when the
programming was an exciting at the

172
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:55,480
moment

173
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:58,480
like I think that these two clips were
kind of entertaining

174
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:02,300
but you never knew what would happen
next even if the station really wasn't

175
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:03,150
that exciting

176
00:12:03,150 --> 00:12:07,580
arm and I found that aspect to be both
exciting and refreshing

177
00:12:07,580 --> 00:12:11,730
and a lot of stuff is changed
technologically and otherwise in the

178
00:12:11,730 --> 00:12:13,100
past thirty years but

179
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:17,230
this aspect to pirate radio has really
kept me fascinated with the hobby the

180
00:12:17,230 --> 00:12:17,960
whole time

181
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:22,760
okay so this presentation it isn't just
on my radio

182
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:27,110
but also on some of these in the
spectrum I'm so if you haven't heard

183
00:12:27,110 --> 00:12:27,960
shortwave

184
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:31,200
you want really know what's an oddity in
what's normal

185
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:35,870
on so let's go back in time about three
more years before this

186
00:12:35,870 --> 00:12:39,920
and everything will get blurry or wavy
and when he gets back in focus

187
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:43,760
you know you there on

188
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:47,760
the first what is often considered to be
the first broadcast

189
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:51,290
was by Reginald person then in nineteen
sex

190
00:12:51,290 --> 00:12:55,520
and he put a little broadcasts on the
air of some

191
00:12:55,520 --> 00:13:00,980
some mom I just a few different things
like us on the plate of a record

192
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:05,209
and some things like that but in the
next 15 years from that point

193
00:13:05,209 --> 00:13:08,709
arm a number of amateur radio operators
from around the country were

194
00:13:08,709 --> 00:13:10,589
experimenting with broadcasting

195
00:13:10,589 --> 00:13:13,709
are both music and community use just
for their

196
00:13:13,709 --> 00:13:17,830
low hometown area I at the same time the
Navy was also

197
00:13:17,830 --> 00:13:21,890
very interested in radio and if you know
anything about the Titanic you

198
00:13:21,890 --> 00:13:23,740
understand why the Navy wanted

199
00:13:23,740 --> 00:13:27,040
a large man spectrum space and
transmitters

200
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:30,790
on every ship come by the nineteen
twenties

201
00:13:30,790 --> 00:13:34,890
radio broadcasting exploded for example
on march tenth

202
00:13:34,890 --> 00:13:38,910
1922 there were 67 broadcasting stations

203
00:13:38,910 --> 00:13:43,150
and by 1926 there 530-6

204
00:13:43,150 --> 00:13:47,530
so it just exploded kind of like I how

205
00:13:47,530 --> 00:13:50,540
the Internet has taken off far between
you know

206
00:13:50,540 --> 00:13:55,030
from 1994 to 1998 arm

207
00:13:55,030 --> 00:13:58,300
one prop problem with everything was
that in the early days

208
00:13:58,300 --> 00:14:01,670
no one has yet developed back into a
boss laters

209
00:14:01,670 --> 00:14:05,780
and the problem was the result was that
statins can only transmit on a small

210
00:14:05,780 --> 00:14:07,300
chunk of low frequencies

211
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:11,810
another problem was the transmitters the
time we're not exactly filtered

212
00:14:11,810 --> 00:14:16,709
and receivers were not exactly selective
the result was the one station on the

213
00:14:16,709 --> 00:14:19,760
air might occupy about a third of the
broadcast band

214
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:23,890
so you can imagine what that would be
like in a place like New York City is

215
00:14:23,890 --> 00:14:24,660
one thing

216
00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:27,760
if it was in the middle of I was there
might only

217
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:31,839
be two stations on your name wasn't hard
for the stations to

218
00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:36,170
not cause interference with each other
but along the coast especially

219
00:14:36,170 --> 00:14:39,180
how the fans were amassed up

220
00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:44,079
so by the nineteen twenties a radio
listening to become a hobby

221
00:14:44,079 --> 00:14:47,350
somewhat like a high-tech version I love
stamp collecting

222
00:14:47,350 --> 00:14:51,180
and people across the country stayed up
late at night trying to hear as many

223
00:14:51,180 --> 00:14:52,510
stations as possible

224
00:14:52,510 --> 00:14:56,579
and writing for radio stamps and cards
from the station's

225
00:14:56,579 --> 00:15:00,480
was such a fat that even movie stars
participate in a contest

226
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:05,329
to hear the most difficult stations
which it's kind of hard to imagine now

227
00:15:05,329 --> 00:15:09,320
and I makes me try to think of a
modern-day radio listening contest with

228
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:12,890
Katy Perry and Miley Cyrus trying to
battle each other

229
00:15:12,890 --> 00:15:16,810
for who can hear the most difficult
station on

230
00:15:16,810 --> 00:15:20,820
3d listening hobby which is called TX in
because TX was a

231
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:24,579
radio abbreviation for distance also
brought about pirates

232
00:15:24,579 --> 00:15:29,110
although on my sins broadcasts occurred
back to the days of Essendon

233
00:15:29,110 --> 00:15:33,360
the first pair broadcast that I found
document it was from 1925

234
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:38,130
at on a newspaper that described how
during one of these contests

235
00:15:38,130 --> 00:15:43,420
are some pirate in the midwest broadcast
music and used a fake English accent

236
00:15:43,420 --> 00:15:47,339
and the call sign up in English station
on the article said that hundreds of

237
00:15:47,339 --> 00:15:50,630
people for Ford into thinking that they
had heard the first transatlantic

238
00:15:50,630 --> 00:15:51,750
station

239
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:56,860
and a apparently a lot of people were
not amused by that

240
00:15:56,860 --> 00:16:01,010
arm so now to jump ahead a little bit so
that I don't spend all my time on radio

241
00:16:01,010 --> 00:16:02,150
history

242
00:16:02,150 --> 00:16:05,310
I in the early days in a few wanna
transmitters on every ship

243
00:16:05,310 --> 00:16:09,640
the public wanted entertainment and
temperatures wanted to experiment

244
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:13,060
all were fighting over just a limited
amount of space and they were

245
00:16:13,060 --> 00:16:17,810
all interfering with each other so the
bans to sound like a massive Morse code

246
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:19,930
from both Navy in amateur stations

247
00:16:19,930 --> 00:16:23,020
and that was all mixed in music

248
00:16:23,020 --> 00:16:27,400
the radio spectrum began to be read
regulated at that point the Navy in the

249
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:29,959
broadcasters took the prime frequencies

250
00:16:29,959 --> 00:16:34,270
any amatures were given the worthless
frequencies above the ambient

251
00:16:34,270 --> 00:16:38,579
the only thing is that this range is
actually usable for longer distances

252
00:16:38,579 --> 00:16:43,030
than those at the navy talk or the AM
broadcast band for that matter

253
00:16:43,030 --> 00:16:47,370
on everyone eventually figured out that
the amateur frequencies call shortwave

254
00:16:47,370 --> 00:16:48,180
at the time

255
00:16:48,180 --> 00:16:52,690
workstream lead valuable before long
issues swath the radio spectrum was

256
00:16:52,690 --> 00:16:54,850
subdivided into different bands

257
00:16:54,850 --> 00:16:58,470
and some these bands were used for
shortwave broadcasting some free amateur

258
00:16:58,470 --> 00:17:01,050
radio some for military communications

259
00:17:01,050 --> 00:17:04,260
some for aeronautical beacons and then

260
00:17:04,260 --> 00:17:07,500
above the sea bebe and there's a section
there was

261
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:10,569
are dedicated to dieter munich won meant

262
00:17:10,569 --> 00:17:13,810
serves a lot a different weird things or
are

263
00:17:13,810 --> 00:17:16,910
placed on the shortwave on

264
00:17:16,910 --> 00:17:21,270
so the first digital no mode was Morse
code

265
00:17:21,270 --> 00:17:25,419
and that dated back to the days the
Telegraph but in the nineteen twenties

266
00:17:25,419 --> 00:17:29,130
radio experimenters had invented
different methods of transmitting

267
00:17:29,130 --> 00:17:30,020
television

268
00:17:30,020 --> 00:17:33,419
and also fax a lot of people think that

269
00:17:33,419 --> 00:17:38,030
television went back to the just the
nineteen fifties I may be 1950 but

270
00:17:38,030 --> 00:17:39,050
actually

271
00:17:39,050 --> 00:17:42,410
regular TV broadcasting went back to
1939

272
00:17:42,410 --> 00:17:46,540
and before that they were experimenting
with TV as early as

273
00:17:46,540 --> 00:17:50,340
the late twenties arm an early fax was

274
00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:54,780
transmitted by radio usually just think
over this by telephone

275
00:17:54,780 --> 00:17:59,570
and are one of the the concepts behind
fax was that

276
00:17:59,570 --> 00:18:03,100
people would be able to get their
newspapers by fax

277
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:07,470
that they were done upset their radio to
a certain frequency

278
00:18:07,470 --> 00:18:10,780
and and not turn on their their
newspaper printer

279
00:18:10,780 --> 00:18:14,650
and go to bed and I'm wake up in the
morning and have newspaper

280
00:18:14,650 --> 00:18:17,900
but unfortunately it wasn't so much the

281
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:20,919
technology there was a problem the more
the

282
00:18:20,919 --> 00:18:24,030
the arm you know how do you worked out
well worth

283
00:18:24,030 --> 00:18:27,110
revenue for newspapers arm

284
00:18:27,110 --> 00:18:31,040
so now it seems like as good a time as
any to play a few audio clips

285
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:34,300
are from different digital modes and
different

286
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:37,710
just kind about things you might find
across the the band

287
00:18:37,710 --> 00:18:41,840
arm the small selection of clips is a
con comprehensive at all

288
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:45,010
but this week I was spending through the
the dials America

289
00:18:45,010 --> 00:18:48,090
recorded a few segments as I passed
through

290
00:18:48,090 --> 00:18:51,679
and also I found a couple things while I
was taken for some %uh this

291
00:18:51,679 --> 00:18:55,030
archive audio like from WTX

292
00:18:55,030 --> 00:18:59,030
so this is are scrambled Voice

293
00:18:59,030 --> 00:19:02,120
and this here's our

294
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:05,429
this is a on military of

295
00:19:05,429 --> 00:19:08,690
of some sort are probably US

296
00:19:08,690 --> 00:19:13,000
do

297
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,100
do

298
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:19,630
do

299
00:19:19,630 --> 00:19:26,620
go comments

300
00:19:26,620 --> 00:19:33,620
a lot of fun was to a WM arm

301
00:19:33,659 --> 00:19:36,279
here's some radio teletype and up

302
00:19:36,279 --> 00:19:40,340
arm for the next couple here radio
telling well I don't know about like 11

303
00:19:40,340 --> 00:19:40,690
but

304
00:19:40,690 --> 00:19:43,850
that in static of 4285

305
00:19:43,850 --> 00:19:48,940
whenever they a match in whenever you're
watching a TV show in there

306
00:19:48,940 --> 00:19:52,499
talking about typing something in a show
something typing

307
00:19:52,499 --> 00:19:56,679
are somebody typing on the screen on
this is about how fast the

308
00:19:56,679 --> 00:19:59,929
the radio teletype and I stand I 428

309
00:19:59,929 --> 00:20:03,710
85 come through there just are on
different systems

310
00:20:03,710 --> 00:20:07,970
love are far are delivering simple

311
00:20:07,970 --> 00:20:14,970
messages and this is really a teletype
but

312
00:20:17,740 --> 00:20:19,350
but

313
00:20:19,350 --> 00:20:23,630
but and

314
00:20:23,630 --> 00:20:27,169
this is like 11 on

315
00:20:27,169 --> 00:20:30,390
from everything I've read this is used
by on nato

316
00:20:30,390 --> 00:20:37,390
I I do I'm not sure who all users Stanek
4285

317
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:52,289
but i've seen a are somebody codes were
from our

318
00:20:52,289 --> 00:20:58,210
French Navy ships basically just telling
basic stuff about their coordinates and

319
00:20:58,210 --> 00:21:05,210
and things like that do

320
00:21:14,610 --> 00:21:16,990
okay here's some airport communications

321
00:21:16,990 --> 00:21:20,059
are just a a little sample this was on

322
00:21:20,059 --> 00:21:23,880
are about a week ago on this was

323
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:29,220
from smokers who comes back this is from
mine airport

324
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:35,580
in Newfoundland draw

325
00:21:35,580 --> 00:21:42,580
finding all try another say

326
00:21:44,820 --> 00:21:50,570
the

327
00:21:50,570 --> 00:21:51,060
are

328
00:21:51,060 --> 00:21:54,340
actually I don't know because for mostly
these I mean

329
00:21:54,340 --> 00:21:58,100
I kinda have been interested in this a
little bit but

330
00:21:58,100 --> 00:22:02,790
for most these these are the the noise
sources that I hear on the band

331
00:22:02,790 --> 00:22:05,970
that I'm avoiding so that I can listen
to buy hurts

332
00:22:05,970 --> 00:22:11,020
so I don't pay as much attention to them
as some people and

333
00:22:11,020 --> 00:22:14,390
on there are some sites that really get
into

334
00:22:14,390 --> 00:22:18,030
what all that the dad is or are 1

335
00:22:18,030 --> 00:22:21,570
okay those were really pretty much
normal stations

336
00:22:21,570 --> 00:22:25,250
awesome kinda strange stations one issue
Samity Sam

337
00:22:25,250 --> 00:22:28,370
least that's what it's been called a the
three

338
00:22:28,370 --> 00:22:31,490
over on the the right hand column down

339
00:22:31,490 --> 00:22:36,540
arm not SSTV but the other three %uh
those are all mystery stations

340
00:22:36,540 --> 00:22:39,630
that nobody really knows what they are
what they're for

341
00:22:39,630 --> 00:22:42,780
arm there are some theories about some
by

342
00:22:42,780 --> 00:22:46,520
the server the strange stations Use
Somebody Sam

343
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:51,620
users are used it was on for just a
little while for like 24 hours a day

344
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:54,730
and it was a repeating clip argue Samity
Sam

345
00:22:54,730 --> 00:23:00,110
from a on a cliff above far of him from
the cartoon Bunker Hill bunny

346
00:23:00,110 --> 00:23:07,059
Anna and then there's data in between
and this is what it sounded like

347
00:23:07,059 --> 00:23:10,789
3

348
00:23:10,789 --> 00:23:17,789
for for

349
00:23:24,549 --> 00:23:25,750
k the next one

350
00:23:25,750 --> 00:23:29,620
was a lot the same except there was in
the data burstyn

351
00:23:29,620 --> 00:23:33,730
and I'm iTunes through one there was a

352
00:23:33,730 --> 00:23:37,039
there was not quite a contest but

353
00:23:37,039 --> 00:23:40,049
it was an international pirate radio day

354
00:23:40,049 --> 00:23:43,409
and so pirate stations from around the
world

355
00:23:43,409 --> 00:23:47,980
a were broadcasting and hoping that
people from around the world the world

356
00:23:47,980 --> 00:23:48,840
would tune in

357
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:53,080
and they're so there were stations in
Europe that were heard in India for the

358
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:54,070
first time

359
00:23:54,070 --> 00:23:57,690
and not a lot of different places like
that in and there's

360
00:23:57,690 --> 00:24:01,929
there some shortwave listeners who don't
necessarily listen to pirates a whole

361
00:24:01,929 --> 00:24:03,640
lot but they're like oh hey there's

362
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:07,620
I A R a pirate thing going on so I'm
just gonna

363
00:24:07,620 --> 00:24:11,140
to an end so on this was down

364
00:24:11,140 --> 00:24:14,159
on nearby but not too far from

365
00:24:14,159 --> 00:24:17,580
where some of the stations were on the
air so I don't know

366
00:24:17,580 --> 00:24:20,789
if it was a a pirate station

367
00:24:20,789 --> 00:24:25,200
that was putting something on that
sounded kinda flaky Samity Sam war

368
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:29,299
maybe there was it was a military
station or what but

369
00:24:29,299 --> 00:24:32,640
it broadcast arm this message

370
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:36,320
arm and then it had 20 seconds a day

371
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:40,240
dead air and then repeated the message
again and it went on for

372
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:44,110
I heard her for about five hours so I
don't know exactly how long I'll

373
00:24:44,110 --> 00:24:48,179
it it did this but it was on for a while

374
00:24:48,179 --> 00:24:55,179
got threat fire

375
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:03,960
and what he's saying is get a dark suit
and greasy wash water all year

376
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:08,290
don't ask me to carry an annoying rag
like that I use an aggressive policemen

377
00:25:08,290 --> 00:25:09,790
the flag follows motorists

378
00:25:09,790 --> 00:25:13,320
so it doesn't really sound like much
anything

379
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:17,540
but if you do a search on these these
are phrases that are used to pick up

380
00:25:17,540 --> 00:25:20,120
different dialects from around the
United States

381
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:23,580
and not that I didn't realize that there
were

382
00:25:23,580 --> 00:25:27,720
asset freezes to up to pick up different
dialects but

383
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:30,840
that's what they're used for so it's
Anna that these are

384
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:34,700
linguistic tools and why somebody would
transmit them

385
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:39,080
over and over and over again on
shortwave I have no idea

386
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:42,710
so I guess that's part of the mystery
and a

387
00:25:42,710 --> 00:25:46,929
the next one is backwards music station
and it's our

388
00:25:46,929 --> 00:25:50,210
is another digital arm I'll

389
00:25:50,210 --> 00:25:54,590
digitally encrypted format of some sort
I i guess its data but I don't know if

390
00:25:54,590 --> 00:25:55,970
it could be something else

391
00:25:55,970 --> 00:25:59,090
or not you know I don't know if there's
voice and

392
00:25:59,090 --> 00:26:03,020
or or anything else but it sounds like
this I

393
00:26:03,020 --> 00:26:06,520
themes a

394
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:10,000
the I

395
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,169
three

396
00:26:12,169 --> 00:26:19,120
theme

397
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:21,500
I

398
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:22,950
I

399
00:26:22,950 --> 00:26:24,940
there

400
00:26:24,940 --> 00:26:27,049
a

401
00:26:27,049 --> 00:26:31,160
the new

402
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:34,580
three

403
00:26:34,580 --> 00:26:36,000
people

404
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:39,080
a

405
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:42,220
all them

406
00:26:42,220 --> 00:26:44,980
que llegas I had a longer than I should
have on

407
00:26:44,980 --> 00:26:48,130
but %uh some people also call that

408
00:26:48,130 --> 00:26:51,290
a them away I'll call station for

409
00:26:51,290 --> 00:26:55,960
obvious reasons on and a lot of people
were kind of interested in now and just

410
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:58,710
because it's so weird that's why record
let's begin with

411
00:26:58,710 --> 00:27:02,130
recorded down about four years ago I
think it was a

412
00:27:02,130 --> 00:27:05,820
it was our broadcasting on the were
transmitting on the edge of

413
00:27:05,820 --> 00:27:10,210
where love the Pirates broadcast so
iTune crossings like a

414
00:27:10,210 --> 00:27:13,970
my school record that is so weird I'll

415
00:27:13,970 --> 00:27:18,130
last one here is slow scan television

416
00:27:18,130 --> 00:27:25,130
SSTV miners my cursor way

417
00:27:35,510 --> 00:27:41,460
for next on Saturday fares

418
00:27:41,460 --> 00:27:44,670
it's not a matter actually TV it's more
like

419
00:27:44,670 --> 00:27:47,890
just like RJ pegs for radio

420
00:27:47,890 --> 00:27:51,370
so you can actually transmitted J pegs

421
00:27:51,370 --> 00:27:56,260
on the radio and so obviously it's
really pop popular one with pirates

422
00:27:56,260 --> 00:27:56,770
because

423
00:27:56,770 --> 00:28:01,310
they can broadcaster a program and then
put on their station logo either before

424
00:28:01,310 --> 00:28:02,770
or after the show

425
00:28:02,770 --> 00:28:07,640
so that one was from Wolverine radio
which is pirate and

426
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:11,700
and I have a one of the an image up the
SSTV

427
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:16,870
from over in radio right there so

428
00:28:16,870 --> 00:28:21,590
arm getting back to are the twenties and
thirties

429
00:28:21,590 --> 00:28:24,590
arm most Pirates at that time were

430
00:28:24,590 --> 00:28:29,380
on s aside from that how excision were
unlicensed a.m. been stations were

431
00:28:29,380 --> 00:28:30,830
broadcasting from a

432
00:28:30,830 --> 00:28:33,930
a town like a regular station what times
Iran from

433
00:28:33,930 --> 00:28:39,300
maybe are really small towns and either
they couldn't get a license

434
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:43,560
words they were arm may be doing it
because they don't like the

435
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:46,910
the government interference and we're
just like well I can put a radio station

436
00:28:46,910 --> 00:28:48,120
on the air so I will

437
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:52,010
are and they tried to hide the fact that
they were on licence

438
00:28:52,010 --> 00:28:55,860
and a lot of times they were operated by
local businesses

439
00:28:55,860 --> 00:29:00,540
arm so they just sounded like a real
regular radio station probably most the

440
00:29:00,540 --> 00:29:01,160
people

441
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:04,640
assume that they were a licensed radio
station

442
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:07,830
I've seen some are report substations

443
00:29:07,830 --> 00:29:11,340
like that they were broadcasting from
coal mines so

444
00:29:11,340 --> 00:29:15,100
they were just the thought a local
station

445
00:29:15,100 --> 00:29:18,290
are one exception to this was WMS

446
00:29:18,290 --> 00:29:22,660
which started in 1925 and they sometimes
one by the slogan

447
00:29:22,660 --> 00:29:26,960
we're on licence mystery station so
obviously that was

448
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:31,720
very different from those other stations
a station operator Dave Thomas

449
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:35,080
are not not the Wendys Dave Thomas on

450
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:38,710
he broadcast he had a emergency flood

451
00:29:38,710 --> 00:29:43,960
broadcast warnings from near the High
River because he lives right at the High

452
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:44,910
River so

453
00:29:44,910 --> 00:29:48,480
he was trying to do some community
service work on our kind of temporary

454
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:49,270
basis

455
00:29:49,270 --> 00:29:53,750
and he also air test specifically sure
four short wave was are

456
00:29:53,750 --> 00:29:58,920
obvious are Thomas sometimes provided
advance notice first us

457
00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:02,780
and his up operations were exactly a
secret

458
00:30:02,780 --> 00:30:06,410
after a while his broadcasts caught the
attention the FCC

459
00:30:06,410 --> 00:30:09,460
which regulates communications in the
United States

460
00:30:09,460 --> 00:30:14,890
a nineteen thirty's radio technology was
not exactly mobile so he didn't have a

461
00:30:14,890 --> 00:30:17,400
way to just drive around in his car

462
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:21,040
and non and broadcaster anything like
that on

463
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:24,040
and here is a picture ribs

464
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:27,680
although here's to you on my sis is a
radio car from

465
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:31,370
WMS this one is from a 1948

466
00:30:31,370 --> 00:30:35,550
so this was near the end of other
stations regular broadcasting

467
00:30:35,550 --> 00:30:39,230
career and

468
00:30:39,230 --> 00:30:42,350
this is awesome transmitting equipment
from

469
00:30:42,350 --> 00:30:46,390
an amateur radio station and the night
late 1920s

470
00:30:46,390 --> 00:30:52,210
and Yahoo became manager of more
miniaturized by the nineteen thirties

471
00:30:52,210 --> 00:30:53,070
but still

472
00:30:53,070 --> 00:30:56,740
most ham stations at that time you
would've been looking about

473
00:30:56,740 --> 00:31:00,580
this much equipment and will be in heavy
and really

474
00:31:00,580 --> 00:31:03,810
unwieldy for just taking on a backpack
or

475
00:31:03,810 --> 00:31:09,550
or anything like that arm our k I'll let
see the

476
00:31:09,550 --> 00:31:12,780
the bottom part is a desk other the

477
00:31:12,780 --> 00:31:16,040
the up at the top you can see a couple
of whites so that

478
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:19,620
that box at the top this probably about
this big

479
00:31:19,620 --> 00:31:25,910
so I and you can see some like a by 11
plaques in upper left hand corner

480
00:31:25,910 --> 00:31:31,010
so it's is probably are hundreds pounds
by Middle East

481
00:31:31,010 --> 00:31:34,310
right there arm so well

482
00:31:34,310 --> 00:31:39,210
Dave Thomas had to try to avoid the FCC
even though he was broadcasting like

483
00:31:39,210 --> 00:31:39,650
that

484
00:31:39,650 --> 00:31:43,170
so well I haven't done are found

485
00:31:43,170 --> 00:31:46,860
okay the I should save the the rumor

486
00:31:46,860 --> 00:31:51,480
is that he had built a transmitter into
a large table

487
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:56,120
and I don't know if the power to the
transmitter or the antenna

488
00:31:56,120 --> 00:31:59,490
lead through the internal X but or
through table legs

489
00:31:59,490 --> 00:32:03,820
but I'm assuming that they both went
through sets upper legs

490
00:32:03,820 --> 00:32:07,900
and when the FCC would arrive he would
bump the table out a place and not the

491
00:32:07,900 --> 00:32:09,220
transmitter of the air

492
00:32:09,220 --> 00:32:12,860
and then the SEC will come in and look
around for the transmitter confine

493
00:32:12,860 --> 00:32:13,920
anything

494
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:19,340
because the whole time wasn't able arm
at that probably wouldn't fall too many

495
00:32:19,340 --> 00:32:24,260
ISEC agents now but there was pretty
clever about eighty-five years ago

496
00:32:24,260 --> 00:32:28,170
on and also wonder about how the the
connections were

497
00:32:28,170 --> 00:32:32,260
if that's actually how it was done
because I he had

498
00:32:32,260 --> 00:32:36,600
AC power hot on the floor like that I
can imagine that you would a modest four

499
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:40,240
too often

500
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:44,930
he wound up by going to civil court a
few times before 1950 but he got away

501
00:32:44,930 --> 00:32:48,420
with on technicalities each time

502
00:32:48,420 --> 00:32:51,660
okay maxed

503
00:32:51,660 --> 00:32:54,730
here is our XKR and

504
00:32:54,730 --> 00:32:59,010
in the nineteen thirties another station
caught the attention the FCC and I've

505
00:32:59,010 --> 00:33:04,110
the other broadcasters are XKR took
advantage of loopholes in the rules

506
00:33:04,110 --> 00:33:07,760
and they put a transmitter ownership the
city a Panama

507
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:11,380
and it was licensed to the country a
Panama

508
00:33:11,380 --> 00:33:15,440
and the idea was that if they were
licensed to a different station then

509
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:19,740
the US can interfere with them they
sailed out and international waters

510
00:33:19,740 --> 00:33:20,900
every morning

511
00:33:20,900 --> 00:33:25,920
are from the coast california on to
outside into international waters

512
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:29,920
okay said that because the boat was also
a floating speeches

513
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:33,250
easy in casino the US State Department

514
00:33:33,250 --> 00:33:36,430
pressure pamacho revoke the registry at
the ship

515
00:33:36,430 --> 00:33:39,970
soon as Panama complied the state the
ship was towed indica

516
00:33:39,970 --> 00:33:44,040
custody by US authorities and that was
the end at the station

517
00:33:44,040 --> 00:33:47,650
apart the pressure for the the station
to go off the air was they were

518
00:33:47,650 --> 00:33:49,920
broadcasting with 500 Watts

519
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:53,560
at that time on e15 killer hurts and on

520
00:33:53,560 --> 00:33:57,080
they were up really interfering with
stations

521
00:33:57,080 --> 00:34:00,390
from Los Angeles on either side of some

522
00:34:00,390 --> 00:34:04,350
and stations complain to them into the
FCC

523
00:34:04,350 --> 00:34:08,610
and a of they said they would move to a
different frequency for

524
00:34:08,610 --> 00:34:12,040
I believe it was ten thousand dollars so

525
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:15,500
they had some other things kind of going
on there too

526
00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:19,060
arm the 1930s gave ways to World War two

527
00:34:19,060 --> 00:34:22,550
and one sense these were not good years
for pirate radio

528
00:34:22,550 --> 00:34:25,710
and they were not good years for a lot
of other people too

529
00:34:25,710 --> 00:34:29,240
%uh the were consumed everything the
amateur radio band

530
00:34:29,240 --> 00:34:32,620
in the United States was closed down I'm
not sure if it's close down everywhere

531
00:34:32,620 --> 00:34:36,390
but was the United States and many
amateurs

532
00:34:36,390 --> 00:34:40,180
became radio operators in the military

533
00:34:40,180 --> 00:34:43,350
plenty of illicit stations were on the
air from Europe but these were

534
00:34:43,350 --> 00:34:45,020
clandestine stations

535
00:34:45,020 --> 00:34:48,580
which job might be somewhat of a synonym
for

536
00:34:48,580 --> 00:34:53,410
underground or pirates but to most
people but in the radio sense radio

537
00:34:53,410 --> 00:34:54,680
terminology

538
00:34:54,680 --> 00:34:58,860
clandestine only means that stations
that are operated by an opposing

539
00:34:58,860 --> 00:35:00,160
government

540
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:03,230
were military group with the intention
of demoralizing

541
00:35:03,230 --> 00:35:06,830
were overthrowing the target are just a
few the station's

542
00:35:06,830 --> 00:35:10,170
other world war two klan the science
contestants sorry

543
00:35:10,170 --> 00:35:13,550
I included out the new british
broadcasting station

544
00:35:13,550 --> 00:35:16,650
gustav seek resigns radio Caledonia

545
00:35:16,650 --> 00:35:20,230
and radio Atlantic and

546
00:35:20,230 --> 00:35:23,510
arm although some the station's claim to
be

547
00:35:23,510 --> 00:35:26,840
broadcasting from either England or
Germany by

548
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:30,140
a little underground group though was
arm

549
00:35:30,140 --> 00:35:33,160
you know somehow rallying against the
authorities

550
00:35:33,160 --> 00:35:36,290
they were almost all operated by

551
00:35:36,290 --> 00:35:39,590
the big are government stations

552
00:35:39,590 --> 00:35:43,660
so why in England they had a special
group to broadcast

553
00:35:43,660 --> 00:35:47,460
to to Germany with a whole bunch of
different stations

554
00:35:47,460 --> 00:35:51,780
and not the same thing for for Germany
so this is a one-out

555
00:35:51,780 --> 00:35:54,980
the on Nazi systems this was the

556
00:35:54,980 --> 00:35:58,390
busy San a transmit earn are or

557
00:35:58,390 --> 00:36:01,510
antenna farm on your Berlin

558
00:36:01,510 --> 00:36:04,650
so some the station's were being
broadcast

559
00:36:04,650 --> 00:36:08,810
to England from as places like this

560
00:36:08,810 --> 00:36:12,580
they weren't at all like somebody
running around in a van

561
00:36:12,580 --> 00:36:16,710
are broadcasting or anything arm

562
00:36:16,710 --> 00:36:19,740
famous underground group such as a
French Dutch

563
00:36:19,740 --> 00:36:24,330
him polish transmitted coded messages
either to each other were to England

564
00:36:24,330 --> 00:36:27,440
you see in all that kinda stuff in a in
the movies

565
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:30,560
I'll but they did broadcast programming
I'll

566
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:34,350
World War two required fast-moving
Army's intelligence and communications

567
00:36:34,350 --> 00:36:36,100
over long distances

568
00:36:36,100 --> 00:36:40,759
%uh the work really advance the managers
Asian portability electronics but

569
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:44,580
and on the other hand also sharpen the
embassy sees abilities to direction find

570
00:36:44,580 --> 00:36:46,500
radio stations because the FCC

571
00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:49,980
had a huge network going on in you in
the US

572
00:36:49,980 --> 00:36:54,510
and they were able to track down some
German spies that were

573
00:36:54,510 --> 00:36:58,830
on feeding back information from here

574
00:36:58,830 --> 00:37:03,740
arm and here is a are just a snapshot
from

575
00:37:03,740 --> 00:37:07,490
someone in the German army I'll looking
at one of their

576
00:37:07,490 --> 00:37:11,840
are ribbed just a Field Communication
radio stations in the field

577
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:17,140
arm one of them is a receiver the other
ones transmitter they work together

578
00:37:17,140 --> 00:37:20,550
and the antenna is on top and as you can
see the

579
00:37:20,550 --> 00:37:23,930
the equipment here really has been
miniaturized and its

580
00:37:23,930 --> 00:37:28,080
it's not small you're not going to hide
it in your pocket but your also gonna

581
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:31,320
you will be able to just pick it up you
can see the handles on it

582
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:34,750
in two guys to carry around an hour

583
00:37:34,750 --> 00:37:38,750
and transmit and not

584
00:37:38,750 --> 00:37:41,820
that kind of lead into the next era

585
00:37:41,820 --> 00:37:45,810
and although I don't know of any Paris
who operated during world war 2

586
00:37:45,810 --> 00:37:49,080
on won a key point so this discussion

587
00:37:49,080 --> 00:37:52,620
is a shortwave radio is sometimes
dismissed by

588
00:37:52,620 --> 00:37:56,870
government budget cutters as just a
queen obsolete medium

589
00:37:56,870 --> 00:38:00,790
and tires have been dismissed for years
as kids playing radio

590
00:38:00,790 --> 00:38:05,190
but if you read the personal counsel
World War two were watch movies

591
00:38:05,190 --> 00:38:10,410
one of the key things that comes up is
broadcasting and it's usually by the BBC

592
00:38:10,410 --> 00:38:14,480
arm the BBC was a lifeblood of freedom
at that time for people

593
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:18,270
in Europe and around the world common
people risk their lives

594
00:38:18,270 --> 00:38:22,200
many times to hear the BBC so even
though the access

595
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:26,260
access control the skies of Europe I
along with the government's

596
00:38:26,260 --> 00:38:30,570
the press the roads the Seas they
couldn't job stop

597
00:38:30,570 --> 00:38:33,720
shortwave radio signals from entering
the territory

598
00:38:33,720 --> 00:38:36,760
and they did try today the Internet is
im

599
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:41,080
information highway more music
newspapers magazines and opinions

600
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:45,370
can be found on the internet and have
ever been published in any given year

601
00:38:45,370 --> 00:38:49,160
but with just a click a button sites can
be removed or blocked

602
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:53,210
postings can be traced and posters can
be jailed

603
00:38:53,210 --> 00:38:57,980
if you travel to North Korea on you
won't be accessing the Internet or your

604
00:38:57,980 --> 00:38:59,040
smartphone

605
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:03,980
you won't be accessing any under strict
media unless you own a shortwave radio

606
00:39:03,980 --> 00:39:08,830
because kim jong Hyun can stop anything
from happening in this country

607
00:39:08,830 --> 00:39:13,310
accept a jessup dennis rodman for making
for himself

608
00:39:13,310 --> 00:39:17,510
and it can stop for a signals

609
00:39:17,510 --> 00:39:22,380
I'm not saying to shortwave radio warp I
radio makes a healthy democracy but I do

610
00:39:22,380 --> 00:39:25,450
feel that it is a component of one

611
00:39:25,450 --> 00:39:29,640
so going back to World War two are the
directions a pirate radio went in

612
00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:33,900
the next era are difficult to explain
hall and exploded

613
00:39:33,900 --> 00:39:37,280
starting in the fifties dozens pirate
sprung up using

614
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:41,080
abandoned surplus US military
transmitters from the war

615
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:44,770
the stations were often operating
relatively in the open

616
00:39:44,770 --> 00:39:48,320
with the support other town and I've
heard stories about

617
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:51,330
on the stations they would set up a a
big tent

618
00:39:51,330 --> 00:39:55,200
and their town and bring the transmitter
out

619
00:39:55,200 --> 00:40:00,110
and they would play polka music and the
hole tamp down with dance around while

620
00:40:00,110 --> 00:40:01,010
the

621
00:40:01,010 --> 00:40:04,810
well they are drank beer and and

622
00:40:04,810 --> 00:40:08,410
the PAR broadcasting which

623
00:40:08,410 --> 00:40:13,690
sounds kinda strange a here is ABC's 610
transmitter

624
00:40:13,690 --> 00:40:16,750
the kind that on that

625
00:40:16,750 --> 00:40:20,520
KPRC used this one

626
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:24,290
was in use by a pirate boat is one that
was left behind in Europe

627
00:40:24,290 --> 00:40:27,310
and it was used by for it is being used
by

628
00:40:27,310 --> 00:40:30,840
an amateur radio operator in Europe

629
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:35,740
on and in the United seasick and it's
been nearly impossible to find a mention

630
00:40:35,740 --> 00:40:37,810
a pirate radio in the fifties

631
00:40:37,810 --> 00:40:41,640
I instead the roots a modern-day North
American para radio

632
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:45,450
seems to be the little kid transmitters
that were used to relay the record

633
00:40:45,450 --> 00:40:47,840
player to the hi-fi said

634
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:50,850
I these are called phone on Slater's or
sometimes

635
00:40:50,850 --> 00:40:55,730
home broadcasters and it seems like most
of our 60's and 70's Pirates got their

636
00:40:55,730 --> 00:40:58,000
start from these cats

637
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:01,320
and

638
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:04,360
on this is station que les from
Cleveland

639
00:41:04,360 --> 00:41:08,520
from 1966 these guys have graduated up
from

640
00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:12,240
those little kids they have a really
pretty a nice setup here for

641
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:16,370
especially for 1966 with the door
turntables we've got other common in the

642
00:41:16,370 --> 00:41:18,080
back that I can see what it is

643
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:21,340
I am a real real no I think they're too
real reals

644
00:41:21,340 --> 00:41:26,050
on back there so these guys said I moved
along pretty well and this is pretty

645
00:41:26,050 --> 00:41:29,910
advanced in the United States for 1966

646
00:41:29,910 --> 00:41:33,760
arm in the British Isles on the other
hand another party Europe the next up

647
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:34,870
was commercial

648
00:41:34,870 --> 00:41:38,460
high-budget ship base broadcasting from
international waters

649
00:41:38,460 --> 00:41:42,200
this is well documented and you might
have even seen a a movie your

650
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:46,430
other things about it this is really in
North Sea international

651
00:41:46,430 --> 00:41:50,130
card from station and now they were
broadcasting

652
00:41:50,130 --> 00:41:54,190
pretty much in the early seventies and
they were on on shortwave you can see

653
00:41:54,190 --> 00:41:56,700
the pic shortwave massed in the center
the bird

654
00:41:56,700 --> 00:42:02,240
and the FM I think I FM transmitters on
either side or FM antenna sorry on your

655
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:03,630
side of that

656
00:42:03,630 --> 00:42:07,790
on the shippers painted if you've
noticed across the sizes

657
00:42:07,790 --> 00:42:11,990
pain at all different colors am between
the colors and the mass there is no

658
00:42:11,990 --> 00:42:13,070
questioning that

659
00:42:13,070 --> 00:42:18,260
this was not just a freighter are
hauling some stuff somewhere this was a

660
00:42:18,260 --> 00:42:21,620
AR pair broadcast station there was a

661
00:42:21,620 --> 00:42:28,400
are playing lots of new music for europe

662
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:31,759
excuse me

663
00:42:31,759 --> 00:42:36,579
okay

664
00:42:36,579 --> 00:42:39,140
okay

665
00:42:39,140 --> 00:42:41,630
arm

666
00:42:41,630 --> 00:42:44,910
so these guys one of by the them
mid-seventies

667
00:42:44,910 --> 00:42:48,119
and by the early seventies

668
00:42:48,119 --> 00:42:51,190
well by mid 70's a European laws I drove
the

669
00:42:51,190 --> 00:42:55,480
the potential offshore stations on the
land and the %uh North American kids who

670
00:42:55,480 --> 00:42:57,349
are playing with the phone on Slater's

671
00:42:57,349 --> 00:43:01,180
that's covered underground music
politics and higher power transmitters

672
00:43:01,180 --> 00:43:04,950
and the Dutch Cup on broadcasting pocos
rock music to the friends neighbors

673
00:43:04,950 --> 00:43:08,180
and Evelyn everyone lived happily ever
after

674
00:43:08,180 --> 00:43:12,490
arm the past four years apart radio or
the modern era

675
00:43:12,490 --> 00:43:16,589
and plenty of names have changed but a
lot of everything else has remained the

676
00:43:16,589 --> 00:43:17,329
same

677
00:43:17,329 --> 00:43:21,750
so I'll try to address are some more
about the specifics of the operations in

678
00:43:21,750 --> 00:43:23,750
equipment and everything in this section

679
00:43:23,750 --> 00:43:28,060
up I think the best way to get a grasp
on how a pirate operates

680
00:43:28,060 --> 00:43:31,810
is to think theoretically about a new
station are like

681
00:43:31,810 --> 00:43:35,000
if someone today would be thinking I
want to start broadcasting

682
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:38,109
I will be the first thing that he would
do are

683
00:43:38,109 --> 00:43:42,099
first would probably be the band of
operations a.m. a firmer shortwave

684
00:43:42,099 --> 00:43:46,119
I FM is most popular but the SEC please
is it the most

685
00:43:46,119 --> 00:43:49,369
%uh the coverage areas smallest and its

686
00:43:49,369 --> 00:43:53,089
the easiest to trace so are there are an
awful lot

687
00:43:53,089 --> 00:43:57,310
love FM stations that go on the air and
wind up getting fined

688
00:43:57,310 --> 00:44:01,560
and now so it's

689
00:44:01,560 --> 00:44:05,880
it's not necessarily the best place for
pirates to operate

690
00:44:05,880 --> 00:44:10,240
on especially because these days I'm not
sure how many people actually tune their

691
00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:11,060
radios

692
00:44:11,060 --> 00:44:16,260
it seems like most people a know what's
on a specific frequency and they hit

693
00:44:16,260 --> 00:44:16,859
their

694
00:44:16,859 --> 00:44:21,030
auto us like 10 the radios there and
that's it

695
00:44:21,030 --> 00:44:25,510
I'm so with the A&B and it has a
fidelity a shortwave

696
00:44:25,510 --> 00:44:30,609
but it's overcrowded the night so I is
really limited kind of has the

697
00:44:30,609 --> 00:44:33,790
were stove of both of the worst aspects
of

698
00:44:33,790 --> 00:44:37,230
after me ensure wave on so

699
00:44:37,230 --> 00:44:41,270
I'll talk about your weight because
that's what thus presentations about

700
00:44:41,270 --> 00:44:41,980
anyway

701
00:44:41,980 --> 00:44:45,890
%uh the main question then for a pirate
years

702
00:44:45,890 --> 00:44:49,859
what transmitter to use because the
transmitter is one make someone

703
00:44:49,859 --> 00:44:53,010
a broadcaster and not just program
producer or

704
00:44:53,010 --> 00:44:57,819
or Web caster other main choices here
are the amateur radio transceiver

705
00:44:57,819 --> 00:45:04,819
damage a radio transmitter where the
homie transmitter and here is a

706
00:45:04,869 --> 00:45:07,990
modernize or relatively modern

707
00:45:07,990 --> 00:45:12,500
are injury to transceiver this is an
icon my see 746 pro

708
00:45:12,500 --> 00:45:15,849
and Alyssia

709
00:45:15,849 --> 00:45:19,839
%uh transceivers like this one are
popular because they work

710
00:45:19,839 --> 00:45:23,490
as full coverage receiver seeking Turner
to around in here

711
00:45:23,490 --> 00:45:27,480
although the short wave dials or or
frequencies

712
00:45:27,480 --> 00:45:31,180
and they can also transmit on the
emitter frequencies

713
00:45:31,180 --> 00:45:36,420
on but with the snow but the diode
almost transceivers can transmit

714
00:45:36,420 --> 00:45:39,770
anywhere from the A&B and up to the top
of the shortwave

715
00:45:39,770 --> 00:45:43,369
so it's our their popular for that
reason

716
00:45:43,369 --> 00:45:46,750
and I'm this one this particular

717
00:45:46,750 --> 00:45:51,470
are I see some forty six Pro has a lot
of features so it's more expensive

718
00:45:51,470 --> 00:45:55,930
and I and more in the 1000 to 1500
dollar range

719
00:45:55,930 --> 00:45:59,109
%uh used how transceivers are

720
00:45:59,109 --> 00:46:04,180
are are also popular because nearly all
of them will operate from either AC or

721
00:46:04,180 --> 00:46:05,790
battery DC power

722
00:46:05,790 --> 00:46:09,579
are so they can be used portable E up
some cheap

723
00:46:09,579 --> 00:46:12,880
cheaper transceivers are the Kenwood TS
for forty

724
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:15,970
the ACU ft seven forty-seven

725
00:46:15,970 --> 00:46:19,990
the icon my see 735 and these are often
more like

726
00:46:19,990 --> 00:46:23,050
$300 to $400 dollars used you can find

727
00:46:23,050 --> 00:46:27,660
a lot of these on on eBay in some other
ones that I've seen on e-bay have

728
00:46:27,660 --> 00:46:29,260
already had the diode snow

729
00:46:29,260 --> 00:46:32,450
snapped so they can a transmit anywhere

730
00:46:32,450 --> 00:46:36,950
on the next one is and all transmitter

731
00:46:36,950 --> 00:46:41,400
this is a Heathkit Apache Anna

732
00:46:41,400 --> 00:46:45,560
this was a for he'd get produce a lot of
different cats

733
00:46:45,560 --> 00:46:49,220
and so you can build on yourselves and

734
00:46:49,220 --> 00:46:53,700
the this one is a this would have been
quite the project to build it yourself

735
00:46:53,700 --> 00:46:57,480
arm is from the late fifties through
sometime in the early sixties

736
00:46:57,480 --> 00:47:00,890
and it has a sort of vintage car appeal

737
00:47:00,890 --> 00:47:05,869
with for the chrome and everything and
I'm not sure how much they weigh but I

738
00:47:05,869 --> 00:47:10,060
think they're about 90 to 110 pounds

739
00:47:10,060 --> 00:47:13,109
and there there's a lot of stealing them

740
00:47:13,109 --> 00:47:17,069
so like an old car they also require
some work replacing

741
00:47:17,069 --> 00:47:21,109
age for herbal parts before they can
operate reliably

742
00:47:21,109 --> 00:47:26,599
I especially with the I'll out
transmitter like the Apache which are

743
00:47:26,599 --> 00:47:29,990
up could be bought in kit form and you
don't really know

744
00:47:29,990 --> 00:47:34,579
yes it was maybe a thirteen year old
building oh without a whole lot of

745
00:47:34,579 --> 00:47:35,250
knowledge

746
00:47:35,250 --> 00:47:39,299
war somebody who was electronics expert
so

747
00:47:39,299 --> 00:47:43,069
even buying a transmitter like this
particular one not all of them but this

748
00:47:43,069 --> 00:47:45,599
particular one there are a lot of
questions

749
00:47:45,599 --> 00:47:48,990
on the way to rise arm but

750
00:47:48,990 --> 00:47:53,220
with a few modifications a transmitter
middle like this will sound as good

751
00:47:53,220 --> 00:47:57,020
or even better than a local AM station
but there had

752
00:47:57,020 --> 00:48:00,390
they're really heavy and name it limited
mobility

753
00:48:00,390 --> 00:48:06,020
arm so probably the some stations have
operated by taking a generator out

754
00:48:06,020 --> 00:48:09,460
and now running of a generator from
somewhere but thats

755
00:48:09,460 --> 00:48:12,760
pretty loud and I that attracts
attention

756
00:48:12,760 --> 00:48:15,829
arm depending on the condition and the
operability

757
00:48:15,829 --> 00:48:19,079
transmitter like the Apache the DP the
heath

758
00:48:19,079 --> 00:48:22,319
the X 100 the Johnson Viking valiant

759
00:48:22,319 --> 00:48:27,119
or the John Johnson biking Ranger on
though often sell for anywhere from one

760
00:48:27,119 --> 00:48:30,520
hundred dollars to twelve hundred
dollars

761
00:48:30,520 --> 00:48:33,730
and the next %uh general category

762
00:48:33,730 --> 00:48:38,589
is the homie transmitter on people build
their own transmitters for a

763
00:48:38,589 --> 00:48:42,770
a variety of reasons of course one is
just for the experience and to learn

764
00:48:42,770 --> 00:48:44,440
more about electronics

765
00:48:44,440 --> 00:48:47,940
and a lot of the the people their number
people get into

766
00:48:47,940 --> 00:48:51,970
up I radio just because they're
interested in building their own station

767
00:48:51,970 --> 00:48:54,579
and they like to play around with
electronics

768
00:48:54,579 --> 00:48:57,650
another important reason is to be able
to have

769
00:48:57,650 --> 00:49:02,130
inexpensive low-powered equipment that
can be operated from battery power

770
00:49:02,130 --> 00:49:05,960
transmitter like the one shown in the
photo could be placed in woodsy area

771
00:49:05,960 --> 00:49:10,549
where State Park or someplace like that
that's kinda Vinod no man's land where

772
00:49:10,549 --> 00:49:12,270
people frequently go

773
00:49:12,270 --> 00:49:15,500
arm so it's not unusual for someone to
be there

774
00:49:15,500 --> 00:49:18,500
and arm and they could be

775
00:49:18,500 --> 00:49:22,869
transmitting for an extended period of
time without the operator

776
00:49:22,869 --> 00:49:25,950
being anywhere near the the transmitter

777
00:49:25,950 --> 00:49:29,569
so that means that the government agents
if they would decide to

778
00:49:29,569 --> 00:49:33,200
go after the station would only get the
transmitter in the antenna

779
00:49:33,200 --> 00:49:37,200
maybe an iPod or some other up
AudioSource

780
00:49:37,200 --> 00:49:41,310
and a and they would not be wind up
finding the operator

781
00:49:41,310 --> 00:49:44,440
the transmitter shown in this photo as a
little

782
00:49:44,440 --> 00:49:49,520
1.1 what course at and this is built
into an Altoids can

783
00:49:49,520 --> 00:49:53,040
so it is really tiny on and

784
00:49:53,040 --> 00:49:56,560
I've heard I i believe that I've heard
this

785
00:49:56,560 --> 00:50:00,869
particular transmitter from hundreds of
miles away

786
00:50:00,869 --> 00:50:05,040
so a they don't necessarily get out

787
00:50:05,040 --> 00:50:09,460
that well that's a i think a better than
the normal I'll

788
00:50:09,460 --> 00:50:14,280
our result but to still the
possibilities are there

789
00:50:14,280 --> 00:50:18,430
on primarily in countries that don't
have much in forstmann Paris build their

790
00:50:18,430 --> 00:50:19,490
own equipment

791
00:50:19,490 --> 00:50:24,420
so they can get more power on station
operators in Serbia Greece and Hollander

792
00:50:24,420 --> 00:50:25,950
notorious for building

793
00:50:25,950 --> 00:50:31,020
usually kilowatt transmitters a number
of stations running 5-10

794
00:50:31,020 --> 00:50:34,690
or more kilowatts are some these are
really interesting

795
00:50:34,690 --> 00:50:38,599
MacGyver looking set-ups up won the ones
that

796
00:50:38,599 --> 00:50:42,359
i've seen our photos I love the
transmitter is built into an old

797
00:50:42,359 --> 00:50:43,530
microwave

798
00:50:43,530 --> 00:50:48,650
and its power supply was built into a
tower computer case

799
00:50:48,650 --> 00:50:52,170
are and a I've I saw one

800
00:50:52,170 --> 00:50:55,520
rat I've talked to one person you went
to a I

801
00:50:55,520 --> 00:50:58,990
visit the station broadcasting in
Scotland and

802
00:50:58,990 --> 00:51:02,940
he had sections of the high power
transmitter everywhere

803
00:51:02,940 --> 00:51:06,210
and K and there were

804
00:51:06,210 --> 00:51:09,540
are wires running down overhead

805
00:51:09,540 --> 00:51:12,960
and his friend came through and said
we'll

806
00:51:12,960 --> 00:51:17,260
what happens if I touch those wires and
he said I don't do that you'll die

807
00:51:17,260 --> 00:51:18,840
so

808
00:51:18,840 --> 00:51:23,270
not somebody's homie transmitters are
there some other things a

809
00:51:23,270 --> 00:51:26,700
other things to make them interesting
arm

810
00:51:26,700 --> 00:51:30,170
and then there's other less used a
reason

811
00:51:30,170 --> 00:51:34,620
is to operate in a different mode the
operator affects FM which is a current

812
00:51:34,620 --> 00:51:35,330
station

813
00:51:35,330 --> 00:51:39,000
a builder's entrance better so that he
can broadcast and seek one stereo

814
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:42,600
and a be broadcast in sequence stereo on
shortwave

815
00:51:42,600 --> 00:51:46,420
and it sounds great on receivers the
candy-coated other

816
00:51:46,420 --> 00:51:49,650
there are some our receivers now the

817
00:51:49,650 --> 00:51:53,100
the SDR software defined radios the
candy code

818
00:51:53,100 --> 00:51:57,320
si chuan stereo and it sounds great on

819
00:51:57,320 --> 00:52:01,170
here's a a really common type event and
others used by pirates

820
00:52:01,170 --> 00:52:05,630
this is an inverted V a cancer survivor
to wire legs

821
00:52:05,630 --> 00:52:09,300
the rundown from either side undercut
match frequency

822
00:52:09,300 --> 00:52:13,660
are at the center support could be
amassed like this one work could be a

823
00:52:13,660 --> 00:52:15,290
tree or something else handy

824
00:52:15,290 --> 00:52:19,100
arm at this one this particular one

825
00:52:19,100 --> 00:52:22,680
is a in image from I radio lowland

826
00:52:22,680 --> 00:52:27,180
in Holland and I evidently they don't
mind if

827
00:52:27,180 --> 00:52:31,360
everyone from blocks away I can see
their antenna and see that this is a

828
00:52:31,360 --> 00:52:32,310
radio station

829
00:52:32,310 --> 00:52:35,390
but most of the people who use

830
00:52:35,390 --> 00:52:40,270
an antenna like this war have them
better camouflage like in other words

831
00:52:40,270 --> 00:52:43,430
or or someplace like that arm

832
00:52:43,430 --> 00:52:47,700
and work because I'm running out of time

833
00:52:47,700 --> 00:52:51,410
here's a a propagation on map of our a
station

834
00:52:51,410 --> 00:52:54,690
and this kind of shows how far I S

835
00:52:54,690 --> 00:52:59,490
the way the Sharif operates that it
creates kinda but don't like pattern

836
00:52:59,490 --> 00:53:02,500
about the smallest range is during the

837
00:53:02,500 --> 00:53:07,280
the right around noon and then it
expands its all my time

838
00:53:07,280 --> 00:53:11,010
and you can see those a station the
signal can spread out

839
00:53:11,010 --> 00:53:14,540
into europe into down into

840
00:53:14,540 --> 00:53:18,720
Mexico and beyond so that's the kind of

841
00:53:18,720 --> 00:53:21,720
propagation you can expect with
short-wave

842
00:53:21,720 --> 00:53:26,170
and on I'm running out of time here

843
00:53:26,170 --> 00:53:29,880
I'm bent kind of trying to compress too
much um

844
00:53:29,880 --> 00:53:32,950
so or

845
00:53:32,950 --> 00:53:36,800
okay

846
00:53:36,800 --> 00:53:39,870
I'm well I got a a little bit to tad

847
00:53:39,870 --> 00:53:42,890
on policy I just skimmed the surface is
this

848
00:53:42,890 --> 00:53:46,840
so I posted a page blanks with more
background information on my blog

849
00:53:46,840 --> 00:53:50,150
and that's the the URL are some links
that I

850
00:53:50,150 --> 00:53:53,900
have up right now our pirate radio forum
so you can check out

851
00:53:53,900 --> 00:53:57,250
are have a lot of Larkins as they happen

852
00:53:57,250 --> 00:54:01,450
a radio magazine links to some short
we're short-wave stations

853
00:54:01,450 --> 00:54:05,340
background information on the hell

858
00:54:19,550 --> 00:54:23,500
knows a little one in the Altoids box
and more links

859
00:54:23,500 --> 00:54:27,520
that I might add over the weekend as I
think I'll so

860
00:54:27,520 --> 00:54:33,230
thanks very much and hurts

861
00:54:33,230 --> 00:54:39,030
effect

862
00:54:39,030 --> 00:54:41,890
premiering to be sitting here he's got a
few copies left

863
00:54:41,890 --> 00:54:45,430
up his at this sad latest pirate radio
welcome our radio annual

864
00:54:45,430 --> 00:54:49,300
I own a copy it's great I recommended on
to be outside a few minutes

865
00:54:49,300 --> 00:54:52,890
not right outside here the table to
answer any questions in you wanna buy

866
00:54:52,890 --> 00:54:55,600
one of his books he might even sign up
for you thanks

867
00:54:55,600 --> 00:55:02,310
make room for the next time

868
00:55:02,310 --> 00:55:06,130
yeah can you do the questions outside
you're gonna clean up here

869
00:55:06,130 --> 00:55:13,080
can't your

870
00:55:13,080 --> 00:55:18,190
page up did

871
00:55:18,190 --> 00:55:25,190
I had several people saved

872
00:58:00,339 --> 00:58:07,339
can you do a quick thing audio for us
has two ok

873
00:58:09,320 --> 00:58:12,040
and China last lap

874
00:58:12,040 --> 00:58:19,040

00:59:46,470 --> 00:59:49,200
everyone am I am night peak

879
00:59:49,200 --> 00:59:53,839
a I N going to speak for the next hour
said he didn't wanna listen to speak

880
00:59:53,839 --> 00:59:54,950
you're in the wrong room

881
00:59:54,950 --> 00:59:59,119
a I'm abuses in at MIT in the center for
the Adams

882
00:59:59,119 --> 01:00:02,430
work on machine control systems and
machine design

883
01:00:02,430 --> 01:00:06,690
and and a I'm going to be talking about
machine design

884
01:00:06,690 --> 01:00:10,250
as a form a descent am I don't know

885
01:00:10,250 --> 01:00:14,799
mister I would like a short story and
how many of you guys remember lol

886
01:00:14,799 --> 01:00:18,359
I don't have any you guys remember

887
01:00:18,359 --> 01:00:22,940
this red balloon challenge diaper
released in 2009

888
01:00:22,940 --> 01:00:26,180
on there a 10 red weather balloons are
they gonna put out

889
01:00:26,180 --> 01:00:29,809
and throughout the United States and
said a whatever he miss

890
01:00:29,809 --> 01:00:33,869
able to find other locations about the
balloons and cinnamon forty thousand

891
01:00:33,869 --> 01:00:34,450
dollars

892
01:00:34,450 --> 01:00:37,880
and a I thought it was a really thinly
veiled attempt to

893
01:00:37,880 --> 01:00:41,240
try to gather information about how
public

894
01:00:41,240 --> 01:00:44,799
might use social media for dissent am

895
01:00:44,799 --> 01:00:48,430
and I thought it was stupid that
taxpayer money was paying for it and

896
01:00:48,430 --> 01:00:51,569
I thought a lot a lot of things but I
have a really problematic

897
01:00:51,569 --> 01:00:55,339
red balloon searching and so we decided
that we're going to you

898
01:00:55,339 --> 01:00:58,619
happy to pack be the a

899
01:00:58,619 --> 01:01:03,310
the competition by putting up fake on
red weather balloons

900
01:01:03,310 --> 01:01:07,080
don't and happen actually

901
01:01:07,080 --> 01:01:11,030
that some other researchers at MIT is
funded by dark but and including mine

902
01:01:11,030 --> 01:01:14,240
and so happen to have a lot of drug
paraphernalia I can pretty

903
01:01:14,240 --> 01:01:17,280
pretty justifiably pull off darpa
impersonator

904
01:01:17,280 --> 01:01:20,590
I'm and on the right as Jeff Moran from

905
01:01:20,590 --> 01:01:23,620
a public lab on and they do

906
01:01:23,620 --> 01:01:26,730
blue napping with red bell weather
balloon so we actually also had a big

907
01:01:26,730 --> 01:01:27,510
supplier

908
01:01:27,510 --> 01:01:31,260
big red weather balloons that I could
put up all over the place and

909
01:01:31,260 --> 01:01:35,680
I work in this really quite well
equipped laboratory where we have

910
01:01:35,680 --> 01:01:39,270
on input at we call them input and
output devices across link skills

911
01:01:39,270 --> 01:01:42,950
so we have laser scanners water jet
cutter is we have

912
01:01:42,950 --> 01:01:48,030
am CT scanners if families urs and a
whole bunch a fabrication equipment and

913
01:01:48,030 --> 01:01:48,490
so

914
01:01:48,490 --> 01:01:51,580
making the little black balloon things
that we could

915
01:01:51,580 --> 01:01:56,110
put up on to impersonate a to
impersonate the red balloon challenge

916
01:01:56,110 --> 01:01:56,450
was

917
01:01:56,450 --> 01:01:59,850
really relatively trivial to this about
five minutes a fabrication

918
01:01:59,850 --> 01:02:03,130
I'm a little bit of helium and and a

919
01:02:03,130 --> 01:02:06,680
and that and the cut because it was that
we have access to because we're research

920
01:02:06,680 --> 01:02:08,850
organization that works on fabrication

921
01:02:08,850 --> 01:02:12,200
a.m. is a is really quite a standing
date we have we have all this

922
01:02:12,200 --> 01:02:15,150
we have all this stuff that we can do
DNA falling with you know some the stuff

923
01:02:15,150 --> 01:02:17,030
that came out of our lives includes

924
01:02:17,030 --> 01:02:20,150
e-ink or that knowing sensor that he'd
say if you don't

925
01:02:20,150 --> 01:02:23,340
buckle your seatbelt Anna and

926
01:02:23,340 --> 01:02:27,500
and I kinda feel like as being able to
make something

927
01:02:27,500 --> 01:02:31,810
to be able to subvert a narrative about
darpa is something that everyone should

928
01:02:31,810 --> 01:02:32,770
be able to do

929
01:02:32,770 --> 01:02:36,020
I because we really had a lot of fun
doing it a

930
01:02:36,020 --> 01:02:41,630
and so using a using the tools in our
lab we teach a class called how to make

931
01:02:41,630 --> 01:02:42,530
almost anything

932
01:02:42,530 --> 01:02:46,150
are nothing if you guys have heard my
advisor younger sons L

933
01:02:46,150 --> 01:02:51,050
about how to make them with anything
takes you through making everything from

934
01:02:51,050 --> 01:02:54,410
electronics two large format

935
01:02:54,410 --> 01:02:57,900
furniture houses on using these tools

936
01:02:57,900 --> 01:03:01,110
a that there but I'm

937
01:03:01,110 --> 01:03:05,550
that that we have access to and we don't
actually stipulate that anyone has to do

938
01:03:05,550 --> 01:03:06,290
whatever they

939
01:03:06,290 --> 01:03:09,760
they can do whatever they want with it
wasn't so people end up making all these

940
01:03:09,760 --> 01:03:11,210
very useful things like

941
01:03:11,210 --> 01:03:15,660
web browsers for their parents our alarm
clocks that you have to wrestle with her

942
01:03:15,660 --> 01:03:19,170
you know it really personal projects
that have nothing to do with

943
01:03:19,170 --> 01:03:22,630
business models are economic Sarah or

944
01:03:22,630 --> 01:03:26,110
are products that are better in for mass
manufacturing

945
01:03:26,110 --> 01:03:30,730
arms and so I digital fabrication as
defined as you're using a computer to

946
01:03:30,730 --> 01:03:32,420
control a fabrication device

947
01:03:32,420 --> 01:03:35,980
making it easy for you to just alter
some code and then remake something a

948
01:03:35,980 --> 01:03:36,610
different way

949
01:03:36,610 --> 01:03:41,280
I'm actually quite a powerful technology
I am then go back in history

950
01:03:41,280 --> 01:03:45,530
a little bit to think about where this
may be our came from and how a

951
01:03:45,530 --> 01:03:49,030
and how I and how yet

952
01:03:49,030 --> 01:03:52,540
history Maidenform how we might use it
going forward I'm so

953
01:03:52,540 --> 01:03:55,620
pressure and I love you remember the
Industrial Revolution

954
01:03:55,620 --> 01:03:58,910
a better a when it started

955
01:03:58,910 --> 01:04:01,710
one of the things that was really
exciting about it was people were able

956
01:04:01,710 --> 01:04:05,160
to get products because products are
becoming cheaper because many factions

957
01:04:05,160 --> 01:04:06,110
can be easier

958
01:04:06,110 --> 01:04:08,700
and we had all these distribution
networks where people could buy things

959
01:04:08,700 --> 01:04:09,480
because

960
01:04:09,480 --> 01:04:13,610
factories kinship goods through the
railroad system or through the roses in

961
01:04:13,610 --> 01:04:14,570
two different places

962
01:04:14,570 --> 01:04:18,210
and we got automobiles which also
enabled personal

963
01:04:18,210 --> 01:04:22,120
mobility on and a lot of media and a lot
of the

964
01:04:22,120 --> 01:04:26,190
a lot of the impetus for developing
better fabrication tools

965
01:04:26,190 --> 01:04:29,300
on kind of came from the war a

966
01:04:29,300 --> 01:04:34,380
there is a big need for precision
manufacturing nothing so you can make

967
01:04:34,380 --> 01:04:34,940
anything

968
01:04:34,940 --> 01:04:38,620
from those comments really nice stuff
that everyone loves working on

969
01:04:38,620 --> 01:04:41,650
am and and that kind of Coughlin so

970
01:04:41,650 --> 01:04:45,600
scientific and engineering efforts

971
01:04:45,600 --> 01:04:49,540
am was extremely strong during the war
and as soon as the war

972
01:04:49,540 --> 01:04:54,200
was over the question kinda became what
is it that we're going to focus on now

973
01:04:54,200 --> 01:04:58,770
as scientists and technologists and a I
don't think im

974
01:04:58,770 --> 01:05:03,230
I don't think that any of them him

975
01:05:03,230 --> 01:05:06,430
it so the air

976
01:05:06,430 --> 01:05:09,860
a to after after the war was over the

977
01:05:09,860 --> 01:05:13,020
a the scams

978
01:05:13,020 --> 01:05:16,940
it was kinda difficult for her

979
01:05:16,940 --> 01:05:20,510
different kinds of people to work on are
to figure out what were collectively

980
01:05:20,510 --> 01:05:21,700
going to be working on

981
01:05:21,700 --> 01:05:25,070
next if there is an imminent threat a

982
01:05:25,070 --> 01:05:29,040
global destruction then how are you
going to work together on the next thing

983
01:05:29,040 --> 01:05:33,210
but continued making tools for
fabrication and

984
01:05:33,210 --> 01:05:37,280
a lot of the tools that were being
developed we're still very strongly

985
01:05:37,280 --> 01:05:38,030
grounded

986
01:05:38,030 --> 01:05:41,370
in kind of a military application I'm so
making

987
01:05:41,370 --> 01:05:44,660
making more consumer cars

988
01:05:44,660 --> 01:05:47,780
but still a strong analogy to military
vehicles to

989
01:05:47,780 --> 01:05:51,050
making I'm flight a and

990
01:05:51,050 --> 01:05:54,780
so automation on a mission was a

991
01:05:54,780 --> 01:05:58,490
on a mission was a is something I was
really taking

992
01:05:58,490 --> 01:06:02,490
retaking the western world by storm in
enabling

993
01:06:02,490 --> 01:06:06,310
mass production up many devices using
economies of scale to be able to give

994
01:06:06,310 --> 01:06:07,830
people cheap products

995
01:06:07,830 --> 01:06:12,320
but those products weren't a necessarily
the kinds of things that at least

996
01:06:12,320 --> 01:06:14,890
someone may be like me would like to see
on the market

997
01:06:14,890 --> 01:06:19,060
as I have a short video to show you so
that we can think about animation

998
01:06:19,060 --> 01:06:25,790
that's from but

999
01:06:25,790 --> 01:06:30,739
for

1000
01:06:30,739 --> 01:06:31,740
for

1001
01:06:31,740 --> 01:06:38,460
a

1002
01:06:38,460 --> 01:06:45,460
for

1003
01:07:15,779 --> 01:07:22,779
here

1004
01:07:32,369 --> 01:07:39,369
her

1005
01:07:44,630 --> 01:07:51,630
for her

1006
01:07:56,769 --> 01:08:03,769
a

1007
01:08:35,430 --> 01:08:42,430
or

1008
01:08:42,720 --> 01:08:43,950
to I guess

1009
01:08:43,950 --> 01:08:48,190
if you think about that video other
thing they just signed all the machines

1010
01:08:48,190 --> 01:08:51,240
that you just i doing things to making
glass jars are making

1011
01:08:51,240 --> 01:08:54,830
I'm car suspension springs are making
petals

1012
01:08:54,830 --> 01:08:59,370
on the trial custom machine is designed
specifically for the purpose of making

1013
01:08:59,370 --> 01:09:03,480
that particular thing I'm so you if
you're the kind of person that makes

1014
01:09:03,480 --> 01:09:07,050
millions a pretzels today then you have
enough money to invest in automation to

1015
01:09:07,050 --> 01:09:07,620
make

1016
01:09:07,620 --> 01:09:11,510
machine that's going to make millions a
practice today much faster for you

1017
01:09:11,510 --> 01:09:15,940
am and a back in 1955 her

1018
01:09:15,940 --> 01:09:19,840
1954 arguably am MIT

1019
01:09:19,840 --> 01:09:23,110
kind of stole the idea of an independent
inventor and hooked up

1020
01:09:23,110 --> 01:09:26,230
a milling machine to a computer am

1021
01:09:26,230 --> 01:09:29,600
and and capability that the commuter
there for has is

1022
01:09:29,600 --> 01:09:32,740
you can change the code easily and not
necessary use

1023
01:09:32,740 --> 01:09:35,860
a general purpose machine to make I am

1024
01:09:35,860 --> 01:09:39,690
to make different kinds of objects
without necessarily need to reconfigure

1025
01:09:39,690 --> 01:09:41,280
your machine for different kinds

1026
01:09:41,280 --> 01:09:44,460
am touring and and and that sir

1027
01:09:44,460 --> 01:09:48,300
that's pretty exciting not just because
you can make a lot of different kinds of

1028
01:09:48,300 --> 01:09:51,140
stuff but because you have axis2

1029
01:09:51,140 --> 01:09:54,690
precision manufacturing which you need
to be able to make more precision

1030
01:09:54,690 --> 01:09:58,170
manufacturing for example more prison
and manufactured homes for example

1031
01:09:58,170 --> 01:10:01,860
but also on any any kinda any kind of

1032
01:10:01,860 --> 01:10:05,350
analytical instrumentation or I am are
different kinda

1033
01:10:05,350 --> 01:10:08,920
machine tools you're going to have to
need I'm a quite high level of times

1034
01:10:08,920 --> 01:10:09,340
which is

1035
01:10:09,340 --> 01:10:12,570
going to take you long time to figure
out how to do by hand

1036
01:10:12,570 --> 01:10:16,140
you may have to put in ten thousand
hours to become a master craftsperson

1037
01:10:16,140 --> 01:10:19,280
or you can just use machine that hasn't
programmed into it

1038
01:10:19,280 --> 01:10:22,620
and so in case you guys hand already
seen what

1039
01:10:22,620 --> 01:10:25,730
a a what a scenes email like a

1040
01:10:25,730 --> 01:10:28,920
included this right video other Mori
Seiki a

1041
01:10:28,920 --> 01:10:32,530
5-axis milling machine i cant find it he
said

1042
01:10:32,530 --> 01:10:35,620
how many guys have ever used a him seems
I'm

1043
01:10:35,620 --> 01:10:39,230
but I for this land pretty

1044
01:10:39,230 --> 01:10:42,250
pretty sexy machine making a turbine
blade

1045
01:10:42,250 --> 01:10:45,630
and has am has XY

1046
01:10:45,630 --> 01:10:49,880
in the top head see in the top hat and
then anbe in the rotary

1047
01:10:49,880 --> 01:10:54,710
a in the rotary aspects see CC is using
all degrees of freedom

1048
01:10:54,710 --> 01:11:01,670
that it is not agree to freedom that has
to be able to make this complicated part

1049
01:11:01,670 --> 01:11:04,739
and a and so computer-controlled a
machine tool

1050
01:11:04,739 --> 01:11:08,239
super awesome make all these complicated
thing however

1051
01:11:08,239 --> 01:11:12,199
it's not changed a whole lot I was just
at nasa ames

1052
01:11:12,199 --> 01:11:15,640
class but two months ago and a

1053
01:11:15,640 --> 01:11:19,140
this is exactly the same milling machine
as it is in that photograph

1054
01:11:19,140 --> 01:11:22,850
on from 1957 in popular science

1055
01:11:22,850 --> 01:11:26,179
except the only thing that the change
about it was the updated the computer at

1056
01:11:26,179 --> 01:11:28,810
some point but the fact the equipment
itself is still

1057
01:11:28,810 --> 01:11:33,429
exactly the same and I guess you know
having can t milling machines to mail a

1058
01:11:33,429 --> 01:11:33,969
large

1059
01:11:33,969 --> 01:11:38,000
pieces of titanium at nasa isn't gonna
change a whole lot better

1060
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:41,840
but you know it's not it's not
necessarily something that people are

1061
01:11:41,840 --> 01:11:42,679
going to need

1062
01:11:42,679 --> 01:11:46,290
at a personal level anytime soon and so
without changing

1063
01:11:46,290 --> 01:11:50,310
I'm the digital fabrication tools I'm
rose not necessarily going to change

1064
01:11:50,310 --> 01:11:53,710
what is going to be made with them so

1065
01:11:53,710 --> 01:11:57,630
I mean you guys frequent a hackerspace
her makers base

1066
01:11:57,630 --> 01:12:01,760
and mister I'm so

1067
01:12:01,760 --> 01:12:06,360
you can use is a fabrication cause for
personal fabrication places like

1068
01:12:06,360 --> 01:12:10,020
problem so am I get our research group
is heavily involved in

1069
01:12:10,020 --> 01:12:13,130
promoting tabloids and helping them run

1070
01:12:13,130 --> 01:12:16,170
I am for example here's one that's in

1071
01:12:16,170 --> 01:12:21,280
Mesmer in Iceland has a full electronics
Workbench CQ hardware hacking

1072
01:12:21,280 --> 01:12:25,590
has a large format 9 machine that only
three axes so not as fancy as the Mori

1073
01:12:25,590 --> 01:12:26,760
Seiki in that video

1074
01:12:26,760 --> 01:12:29,920
am has a laser cutter so you can cut

1075
01:12:29,920 --> 01:12:33,130
plastics and words and has a small tree
pruner

1076
01:12:33,130 --> 01:12:36,400
have a small milling machine for
electronics prototyping and then

1077
01:12:36,400 --> 01:12:39,810
has computers for doing I'm digital
design

1078
01:12:39,810 --> 01:12:44,699
and her simulation a man and this base
is a

1079
01:12:44,699 --> 01:12:47,870
a this space is kinda nice because
people are so common

1080
01:12:47,870 --> 01:12:50,940
and are able to interact with other
experts that are trying to use these

1081
01:12:50,940 --> 01:12:51,690
machines

1082
01:12:51,690 --> 01:12:54,770
however am we found that using machines

1083
01:12:54,770 --> 01:12:58,350
was complicated enough that we had to
rewrite some other the

1084
01:12:58,350 --> 01:13:02,030
design and manufacturing internals so
that

1085
01:13:02,030 --> 01:13:05,360
am novices could have access to that a
more on that in a second

1086
01:13:05,360 --> 01:13:08,449
and so you know in fab labs

1087
01:13:08,449 --> 01:13:11,780
even though the machines are maybe not
entirely designed for

1088
01:13:11,780 --> 01:13:15,230
personal fabrication purposes people are
still making interesting things oh

1089
01:13:15,230 --> 01:13:18,510
C&D that he's working on am wooden

1090
01:13:18,510 --> 01:13:22,940
prosthetic feet prototypes and I don't
know if any of you guys are other

1091
01:13:22,940 --> 01:13:26,560
Babb by a wireless mesh network there is
a in the Fab Lab

1092
01:13:26,560 --> 01:13:29,940
in Jalalabad Afghanistan there was one
satellite drop

1093
01:13:29,940 --> 01:13:34,050
on and so to be able to share that
Internet across all the ngos that were

1094
01:13:34,050 --> 01:13:35,190
spread through

1095
01:13:35,190 --> 01:13:39,500
a that were spread through the city I'm
they created these parabolic dishes

1096
01:13:39,500 --> 01:13:42,800
on their 3-axis CNC router on

1097
01:13:42,800 --> 01:13:45,910
and then modified a WRX

1098
01:13:45,910 --> 01:13:50,310
a surrender spirit he a router so that
they would have

1099
01:13:50,310 --> 01:13:54,380
a longer a longer wait time before I
could drop so that they could send

1100
01:13:54,380 --> 01:13:58,020
internet out to other spaces on
throughout the city

1101
01:13:58,020 --> 01:14:01,830
now is entirely kinda a this is our
problem

1102
01:14:01,830 --> 01:14:05,100
there's not a market that has this
problem intervention a

1103
01:14:05,100 --> 01:14:08,469
another student in my lab who wanted a
kayak

1104
01:14:08,469 --> 01:14:11,840
and so humid I am see you have all these
yellow

1105
01:14:11,840 --> 01:14:15,960
you have access to this digital
fabrication equipment and you can read

1106
01:14:15,960 --> 01:14:17,320
back to rate to do different things

1107
01:14:17,320 --> 01:14:20,800
and obviously something must be really
interesting about it because for example

1108
01:14:20,800 --> 01:14:23,030
and the Fab Lab internets

1109
01:14:23,030 --> 01:14:26,239
are not question is hear someone over
there

1110
01:14:26,239 --> 01:14:29,290
I'm so cautious 511 do next

1111
01:14:29,290 --> 01:14:34,679
and was occupied because obviously you
can't have people have access to design

1112
01:14:34,679 --> 01:14:37,550
fabrication tools that they might just
use them for dissent

1113
01:14:37,550 --> 01:14:40,940
I'm so three press may be kinda
political after all

1114
01:14:40,940 --> 01:14:46,449
a but a using all of these tools still
kinda sucks and so that's kinda what I

1115
01:14:46,449 --> 01:14:47,010
wanted

1116
01:14:47,010 --> 01:14:50,460
a cut above what I wanted to get to talk
about today

1117
01:14:50,460 --> 01:14:53,980
I'm hearing about just the CNC milling
machine that you

1118
01:14:53,980 --> 01:14:57,679
so I in that video earlier to be able to
write the toolpath

1119
01:14:57,679 --> 01:15:02,340
for that nine machine you have to use
horrible horrible software packages that

1120
01:15:02,340 --> 01:15:04,100
generally only run on Windows

1121
01:15:04,100 --> 01:15:09,530
on the controls get exported and G code
which is not a Turing complete language

1122
01:15:09,530 --> 01:15:14,730
it's on if you think that someone is
giving a talk on G code today

1123
01:15:14,730 --> 01:15:17,460
on what you want to learn more about she
cut but as far as I'm concerned we

1124
01:15:17,460 --> 01:15:19,020
should get rid of D Cody Curtis

1125
01:15:19,020 --> 01:15:24,010
stupid I'm menu you have like a really
fancy interface where you take a USB

1126
01:15:24,010 --> 01:15:24,860
stick in you

1127
01:15:24,860 --> 01:15:28,239
put the g-code that just says go from
this corn into this cornet

1128
01:15:28,239 --> 01:15:32,440
I'm to a machine that has an amazing
interface like this

1129
01:15:32,440 --> 01:15:35,620
and and then a you say

1130
01:15:35,620 --> 01:15:38,760
their national button that says load
tape

1131
01:15:38,760 --> 01:15:42,640
when you put your USB stick in because
it

1132
01:15:42,640 --> 01:15:45,720
it nobody bothered updated sins

1133
01:15:45,720 --> 01:15:49,320
I am many I guess machine answers a
recalcitrant types that don't

1134
01:15:49,320 --> 01:15:52,030
necessarily want you to be changing our
their vocabulary

1135
01:15:52,030 --> 01:15:55,790
but it's a it's not great and then you
know you bring your and no

1136
01:15:55,790 --> 01:15:59,130
and then you show up in the machine shop
new washing machine machine doesn't have

1137
01:15:59,130 --> 01:15:59,780
all the fun

1138
01:15:59,780 --> 01:16:03,930
and generally especially if you're not
running the same job over and over again

1139
01:16:03,930 --> 01:16:07,150
if something's gonna go wrong in your
tool path you wanna be there before the

1140
01:16:07,150 --> 01:16:09,960
entire lab burns down so you just have
to kind of sit there

1141
01:16:09,960 --> 01:16:13,000
and watched machine due out the work I'm

1142
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:16,160
and so am

1143
01:16:16,160 --> 01:16:19,910
if we want to decompose machine tools
into what they're a

1144
01:16:19,910 --> 01:16:23,480
what they're different what they're
different parts are on and this

1145
01:16:23,480 --> 01:16:26,710
pyramid that I like to talk about where
can have the

1146
01:16:26,710 --> 01:16:30,100
the be pyramid of machine control

1147
01:16:30,100 --> 01:16:33,920
and where you start out with yes some
towelhead so imagine we have a laser

1148
01:16:33,920 --> 01:16:35,670
cutter the two had a laser or

1149
01:16:35,670 --> 01:16:39,270
if we have a milling machine the
two-headed has been on and so and it

1150
01:16:39,270 --> 01:16:41,600
will head that we want to move around in
to be able to move around

1151
01:16:41,600 --> 01:16:45,580
in a constrained fashion a we have some
mechanical system that we're placing the

1152
01:16:45,580 --> 01:16:46,430
two ahead on

1153
01:16:46,430 --> 01:16:49,920
so maybe it's a maybe it's a and ex-wife
roemer

1154
01:16:49,920 --> 01:16:52,510
maybe it's something that we spend from
the feeling that we want to move up and

1155
01:16:52,510 --> 01:16:53,110
down

1156
01:16:53,110 --> 01:16:56,120
and so once you have it on that
mechanical constraint

1157
01:16:56,120 --> 01:17:01,250
frame on you have to move it somehow and
so maybe you can move it by hand you

1158
01:17:01,250 --> 01:17:02,120
don't need to have

1159
01:17:02,120 --> 01:17:05,480
on a MIDI controller maybe you need
sensors and actuators to move those

1160
01:17:05,480 --> 01:17:06,430
things around so

1161
01:17:06,430 --> 01:17:10,480
the center not sensors and actuators
like stepper motors are servos

1162
01:17:10,480 --> 01:17:13,480
or am babe you're using hydraulics a

1163
01:17:13,480 --> 01:17:17,370
those things have to be specified as
well and then once you have

1164
01:17:17,370 --> 01:17:21,460
your to head which is on a mechanical
system which is moving around using some

1165
01:17:21,460 --> 01:17:22,770
kinda actuator

1166
01:17:22,770 --> 01:17:26,770
on then you're gonna have to have some
kind of control system that's gonna tell

1167
01:17:26,770 --> 01:17:30,880
the actuators how to move in response to
the sensor input

1168
01:17:30,880 --> 01:17:34,370
and their control system could be a PLC

1169
01:17:34,370 --> 01:17:37,710
PLC is viable for a and exciting
security attacks

1170
01:17:37,710 --> 01:17:41,500
a could be a could be just a
microcontroller or it could be a

1171
01:17:41,500 --> 01:17:44,520
a single purpose computer I am

1172
01:17:44,520 --> 01:17:48,230
and then to be able to talk to that
control system you have to have some way

1173
01:17:48,230 --> 01:17:50,690
that you're gonna come up with the
commands that you're gonna tell

1174
01:17:50,690 --> 01:17:53,860
and so you have applications and
interfaces a

1175
01:17:53,860 --> 01:17:57,240
Lake a master cam or a

1176
01:17:57,240 --> 01:18:00,710
I did ask 123d sweet and there's a

1177
01:18:00,710 --> 01:18:05,520
there's kinda on the left I have a logo
Zavala the kinda industry

1178
01:18:05,520 --> 01:18:08,900
typical industry standard like things
they're all

1179
01:18:08,900 --> 01:18:12,910
as a dollar's using them requires a
hundreds of hours of training

1180
01:18:12,910 --> 01:18:16,500
and they're all really quite annoying
and then on the right I'm

1181
01:18:16,500 --> 01:18:19,850
there's a there's a bunch of open source

1182
01:18:19,850 --> 01:18:24,010
alternatives that while on they're not
going to be used to

1183
01:18:24,010 --> 01:18:28,010
run a car factory anytime soon there
slowly improving

1184
01:18:28,010 --> 01:18:31,970
but the problem is we're one of the
problems is that

1185
01:18:31,970 --> 01:18:35,380
along this pyramid there's a lot of
stratification between the layers each

1186
01:18:35,380 --> 01:18:38,200
each layer here is a pretty well
established field in your gonna have

1187
01:18:38,200 --> 01:18:38,950
people that

1188
01:18:38,950 --> 01:18:42,100
know how to do it really well and then
you can have people that know how to

1189
01:18:42,100 --> 01:18:42,380
really

1190
01:18:42,380 --> 01:18:45,660
do really well maybe also want to do in
their free time and maybe what about an

1191
01:18:45,660 --> 01:18:46,830
open source alternative

1192
01:18:46,830 --> 01:18:50,240
but you don't necessarily have people
that are like oh you know I like working

1193
01:18:50,240 --> 01:18:51,690
on mechanical systems

1194
01:18:51,690 --> 01:18:54,860
and I also wanna make an application
interface for it

1195
01:18:54,860 --> 01:18:58,690
that's really easy to use and so going
from

1196
01:18:58,690 --> 01:19:02,850
each layer to the next layer obispo care
med is kind of like a bad party trick if

1197
01:19:02,850 --> 01:19:03,750
telecom

1198
01:19:03,750 --> 01:19:07,130
really good I made this code and I'm
gonna have to get to talk to this

1199
01:19:07,130 --> 01:19:09,880
machine in my motor speed is we protocol
unlike

1200
01:19:09,880 --> 01:19:13,150
you end up with really stubborn people
like me

1201
01:19:13,150 --> 01:19:16,440
but like working in this space but
otherwise everyone is kinda like at

1202
01:19:16,440 --> 01:19:17,800
everything is just kinda hack

1203
01:19:17,800 --> 01:19:21,850
I'm so even if they're incrementally
improving is a fabrication tools are

1204
01:19:21,850 --> 01:19:22,340
still

1205
01:19:22,340 --> 01:19:25,650
not that accessible for people who just
want to show up and get

1206
01:19:25,650 --> 01:19:29,820
something done on cuz we have been a
keypad interface is

1207
01:19:29,820 --> 01:19:32,650
applications a digital fabrication
machines are really quite limited

1208
01:19:32,650 --> 01:19:34,440
because they're grounded in this

1209
01:19:34,440 --> 01:19:37,640
military-industrial history a

1210
01:19:37,640 --> 01:19:42,000
what we want CNC equipment for we want
to make really precise metal parts and

1211
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:42,840
we want to make

1212
01:19:42,840 --> 01:19:47,390
things that approximately this big and I
am we want to have the most position

1213
01:19:47,390 --> 01:19:49,660
possible therefore we can use really
expensive

1214
01:19:49,660 --> 01:19:53,690
materials I'm and a a most of the

1215
01:19:53,690 --> 01:19:57,070
muster the fabricators served as a
fabrication equipment are

1216
01:19:57,070 --> 01:20:00,820
kinda you can have got cluster them into
only a a few corporations

1217
01:20:00,820 --> 01:20:05,420
it for example in the in the 3d printer
space you have like a wide range if DIY

1218
01:20:05,420 --> 01:20:08,470
kind of 3d printer people and then
everyone else is pretty much

1219
01:20:08,470 --> 01:20:12,480
owned by Stratus is or 3d Systems
weather which I would say they're

1220
01:20:12,480 --> 01:20:17,130
pretty evil company so you know you do
we really want them to be controlling

1221
01:20:17,130 --> 01:20:18,850
how we can interface with their

1222
01:20:18,850 --> 01:20:22,380
I am with our fabrication I

1223
01:20:22,380 --> 01:20:25,960
kinda disagree with that so a I guess
yep for me it's a

1224
01:20:25,960 --> 01:20:29,050
men the question is can we build all of
these things ourselves really suffered

1225
01:20:29,050 --> 01:20:29,370
some

1226
01:20:29,370 --> 01:20:33,020
the technology that already exist out
there I'm and so

1227
01:20:33,020 --> 01:20:36,540
me and a friend of mine a line where
spend some time teaching

1228
01:20:36,540 --> 01:20:40,350
machine designed and machine building to
people who otherwise don't think that

1229
01:20:40,350 --> 01:20:43,510
they should be doing machine designed
and machine gunning for this is

1230
01:20:43,510 --> 01:20:47,520
last week in Spain during their n of Fab
Lab conference

1231
01:20:47,520 --> 01:20:52,160
we got anyone interested in trying to
build a machine in three days to come up

1232
01:20:52,160 --> 01:20:56,750
learn about a different kinds of motion
systems different and mechanical systems

1233
01:20:56,750 --> 01:21:00,490
you're kinda control systems on and make
him a

1234
01:21:00,490 --> 01:21:04,600
a lot a pretty silly ideas for machines
like this one is a get coffee

1235
01:21:04,600 --> 01:21:08,450
a copy machine called a good morning
machine where you can choosing have tea

1236
01:21:08,450 --> 01:21:12,540
or coffee W sugar it'll be melted or
write your name in like I love you on

1237
01:21:12,540 --> 01:21:13,580
your copy

1238
01:21:13,580 --> 01:21:18,090
a and and you that's a very useful
machine for

1239
01:21:18,090 --> 01:21:21,240
that person I'm sure I

1240
01:21:21,240 --> 01:21:25,170
in 30 you know it if if if prototyping
something like this was easier than

1241
01:21:25,170 --> 01:21:27,060
having to make coffee every morning

1242
01:21:27,060 --> 01:21:30,340
a than I feel like a lot more people
would do it on

1243
01:21:30,340 --> 01:21:34,010
and so at the conference we also use
machines to make machines so this is

1244
01:21:34,010 --> 01:21:38,180
on the right you can see there's like a
folding 3d printer

1245
01:21:38,180 --> 01:21:41,940
that's a that sir a prototype that was
made by

1246
01:21:41,940 --> 01:21:45,370
a Flores it who's from the have a mess
it's

1247
01:21:45,370 --> 01:21:49,720
and then on the left is a phone call or
prototype a machine

1248
01:21:49,720 --> 01:21:53,390
that is a small-scale version other
bricklaying machine

1249
01:21:53,390 --> 01:21:56,480
so madge in you wanted your lay bricks
not just in a straight line but you

1250
01:21:56,480 --> 01:21:57,420
would wanna lay them

1251
01:21:57,420 --> 01:22:01,110
throughout space how everyone and I'm so
this is a system with

1252
01:22:01,110 --> 01:22:04,730
for police that can extend in different
directions am

1253
01:22:04,730 --> 01:22:07,890
so it depending on where within the
friend you are you can lay bricks in

1254
01:22:07,890 --> 01:22:08,980
different places

1255
01:22:08,980 --> 01:22:12,490
which was a pretty ambitious pretty
ambitious machine to want a prototype

1256
01:22:12,490 --> 01:22:15,650
in nine hours but they got

1257
01:22:15,650 --> 01:22:19,050
they got for have to make a scale model
so here's a here's some more the machine

1258
01:22:19,050 --> 01:22:20,540
protects that we are building

1259
01:22:20,540 --> 01:22:24,200
and a I guess one thing that I

1260
01:22:24,200 --> 01:22:27,910
like to stress about mechanical design
is it seems that

1261
01:22:27,910 --> 01:22:31,360
there's this iteration you wanna read
some software

1262
01:22:31,360 --> 01:22:34,860
you wanna read it the UN a basket in
takes you like two minutes are

1263
01:22:34,860 --> 01:22:39,160
one minute and a and it doesn't work you
change something and you tried again and

1264
01:22:39,160 --> 01:22:40,920
eventually your script is going to do

1265
01:22:40,920 --> 01:22:44,320
what you wanted to do on but he do
mechanical design

1266
01:22:44,320 --> 01:22:47,650
then you have to protect the whole thing
and he made some big mistake

1267
01:22:47,650 --> 01:22:51,280
a then you have to change a bunch of
stuff and changing that takes a lot

1268
01:22:51,280 --> 01:22:52,740
longer than just

1269
01:22:52,740 --> 01:22:56,190
changing am code and so

1270
01:22:56,190 --> 01:23:00,530
I guess some people criticize are you
serve phone Korean hot glue because

1271
01:23:00,530 --> 01:23:04,090
really chemical engineers obviously only
he is aluminum and metal

1272
01:23:04,090 --> 01:23:07,930
but it's really easy way to pen a
experiment with different form factors

1273
01:23:07,930 --> 01:23:09,330
that you might have

1274
01:23:09,330 --> 01:23:12,600
in your machine so I can let you can
have

1275
01:23:12,600 --> 01:23:15,320
didn't particularly the Tyrant is
entirely correctly then you can just

1276
01:23:15,320 --> 01:23:17,740
shove it over and add some good

1277
01:23:17,740 --> 01:23:21,050
am here's a accuser a kind yes

1278
01:23:21,050 --> 01:23:24,180
logo journalist machine that these guys
built

1279
01:23:24,180 --> 01:23:27,750
am during be a during during the
conference 30

1280
01:23:27,750 --> 01:23:31,920
this girl this is all just three days
%uh were third machine prototyping and

1281
01:23:31,920 --> 01:23:34,490
we came up with six different machine
prototypes

1282
01:23:34,490 --> 01:23:37,930
each to do and a very specific thing and
me

1283
01:23:37,930 --> 01:23:41,120
be did not only the McKenna last night
but also the controls in the software

1284
01:23:41,120 --> 01:23:42,260
and a

1285
01:23:42,260 --> 01:23:45,550
how people might want to interface with
the software so not necessarily making

1286
01:23:45,550 --> 01:23:46,990
the assumption that the way that you
wanted

1287
01:23:46,990 --> 01:23:50,410
use a machine is by standing in front of
a laptop and then using it

1288
01:23:50,410 --> 01:23:54,030
I'm in so starting to build your own
machine solutions

1289
01:23:54,030 --> 01:23:57,760
is something that a that I think felt
pretty strongly about it and hopefully

1290
01:23:57,760 --> 01:24:00,050
convince other people during that what's
up to do

1291
01:24:00,050 --> 01:24:03,380
am and so in terms of some machines that

1292
01:24:03,380 --> 01:24:07,420
I've Bell am Solon and I who taught the
workshop we built this machine at some

1293
01:24:07,420 --> 01:24:08,130
point

1294
01:24:08,130 --> 01:24:13,050
which is a suitcase multi-purpose CNC
machine so it has a milling head in this

1295
01:24:13,050 --> 01:24:14,960
photograph it snowing a circuit board

1296
01:24:14,960 --> 01:24:18,600
it also has a 3d print head it also has
a liquid handling heads up you and your

1297
01:24:18,600 --> 01:24:20,510
bio experiment something to do

1298
01:24:20,510 --> 01:24:24,770
on a mini bio experiments and has a girl
scoring and cutting head

1299
01:24:24,770 --> 01:24:29,220
a.m. and it folds down into this
briefcase so you can take it with you

1300
01:24:29,220 --> 01:24:33,190
at taking it many times as a personal
item on a plane

1301
01:24:33,190 --> 01:24:37,350
the TSA never asked me about it a me
sometimes

1302
01:24:37,350 --> 01:24:40,610
this up ask me about like I have space
mouse

1303
01:24:40,610 --> 01:24:43,640
asked me about that but apparently if
you cue

1304
01:24:43,640 --> 01:24:47,710
make your stuff look like it's very
serious

1305
01:24:47,710 --> 01:24:52,920
men the TSA back to get you in trouble
I'm and so yeah

1306
01:24:52,920 --> 01:24:57,960
them to the packy tension yeah in the
family recognize it as a two-headed

1307
01:24:57,960 --> 01:25:01,680
than the recommended as a weapon so
these are all different machines that it

1308
01:25:01,680 --> 01:25:06,660
a worked on kinda experimenting with
different form factors it's not just

1309
01:25:06,660 --> 01:25:07,260
that

1310
01:25:07,260 --> 01:25:10,530
thinking about machine building at
something that

1311
01:25:10,530 --> 01:25:14,160
you want to have for more custom
machines but also

1312
01:25:14,160 --> 01:25:17,960
how do you make machines more accessible
by making them cheaper

1313
01:25:17,960 --> 01:25:21,310
and more portable and Morel more likely
to be

1314
01:25:21,310 --> 01:25:24,700
to be encountered in a in a in a space
like a

1315
01:25:24,700 --> 01:25:28,340
in a bid to go home or a small office
rather than

1316
01:25:28,340 --> 01:25:31,970
a a space that has a workshop like a.m.
like MIT

1317
01:25:31,970 --> 01:25:36,260
and so you can in these photos there's a
there some small format 9 machines for

1318
01:25:36,260 --> 01:25:38,080
circuit board prototyping

1319
01:25:38,080 --> 01:25:42,200
am there's like a a machine that we may
just to drop

1320
01:25:42,200 --> 01:25:45,940
sally port ritz a there's a there's
another

1321
01:25:45,940 --> 01:25:50,310
liquid handling machine for bio purposes
and so I'm

1322
01:25:50,310 --> 01:25:53,930
its we've been thinking more about how
you decompose

1323
01:25:53,930 --> 01:25:58,760
machine in machine building into
different modules and so

1324
01:25:58,760 --> 01:26:02,440
am right now I'm working a lot with
different reconfigurable modules that

1325
01:26:02,440 --> 01:26:02,990
you can

1326
01:26:02,990 --> 01:26:06,240
easily use so you only you need a
machine that needs that needs to move in

1327
01:26:06,240 --> 01:26:08,660
one axis and you're moving a
back-and-forth

1328
01:26:08,660 --> 01:26:11,950
are you need something that moves back
and forth and in turn something on and

1329
01:26:11,950 --> 01:26:13,290
then turned something off

1330
01:26:13,290 --> 01:26:16,730
on were making all these kinda models
that snapped together so you could

1331
01:26:16,730 --> 01:26:19,980
easily protect different kinds of
machines and

1332
01:26:19,980 --> 01:26:23,470
again not just the mechanical protecting
is important but also

1333
01:26:23,470 --> 01:26:28,620
the control system and so instead of
using one single microcontroller that

1334
01:26:28,620 --> 01:26:31,890
interprets g-code and sends commands to
motorists

1335
01:26:31,890 --> 01:26:36,410
am for using a a for using a networked
approach so that

1336
01:26:36,410 --> 01:26:40,300
be a every single every single note on
the network addresses a different part

1337
01:26:40,300 --> 01:26:41,240
of the machine

1338
01:26:41,240 --> 01:26:45,180
and you have a virtual machine on your
computer so say said to milling machine

1339
01:26:45,180 --> 01:26:46,410
with three axes

1340
01:26:46,410 --> 01:26:50,240
the virtual machine says there's a
there's a synchronized move between XY

1341
01:26:50,240 --> 01:26:51,410
and z. Accies

1342
01:26:51,410 --> 01:26:54,810
there's the spin-off and the spin on and
shove those are different nodes on the

1343
01:26:54,810 --> 01:26:56,680
network that you can call functions on

1344
01:26:56,680 --> 01:27:01,650
as opposed to you just streaming g-code
by live apart and hoping that

1345
01:27:01,650 --> 01:27:05,150
the g-code interpreter is interpreting
it correctly and if you want to stop in

1346
01:27:05,150 --> 01:27:06,730
reiterate our change something

1347
01:27:06,730 --> 01:27:09,760
you don't have to I am you don't have to

1348
01:27:09,760 --> 01:27:13,190
country have to try to backtrack through
your key code for free but you can

1349
01:27:13,190 --> 01:27:13,850
change things

1350
01:27:13,850 --> 01:27:17,280
on the fly and that's that maybe

1351
01:27:17,280 --> 01:27:21,010
not that exciting in the example above 9
machine because milling machines do what

1352
01:27:21,010 --> 01:27:24,220
they do pretty well gee code is pretty
wild about furnishings

1353
01:27:24,220 --> 01:27:27,390
but if you for example wanted to do
something

1354
01:27:27,390 --> 01:27:30,440
else with the g-code with with your
milling machine so say you wanted to

1355
01:27:30,440 --> 01:27:31,180
mill

1356
01:27:31,180 --> 01:27:34,640
until until you got to the red layer

1357
01:27:34,640 --> 01:27:38,500
other material and then switch you could
easily put a camera that would recognize

1358
01:27:38,500 --> 01:27:41,160
between say the red layer and the green
layer

1359
01:27:41,160 --> 01:27:45,170
I am but you couldn't necessarily have
the interface with you g code would have

1360
01:27:45,170 --> 01:27:45,690
to write

1361
01:27:45,690 --> 01:27:48,910
a very complicated carville a

1362
01:27:48,910 --> 01:27:52,410
control systems and software to be able
to to be able to it

1363
01:27:52,410 --> 01:27:56,100
to to add that simple functionality to
your machine they're trying to get a

1364
01:27:56,100 --> 01:27:59,250
her away from that I'm so here's a

1365
01:27:59,250 --> 01:28:03,880
with the modulus just to show you guys
here's a and

1366
01:28:03,880 --> 01:28:07,530
she moves in San Jose the Nationals in
China

1367
01:28:07,530 --> 01:28:10,620
shins for this one maidens

1368
01:28:10,620 --> 01:28:14,930
22 our way has including UBS

1369
01:28:14,930 --> 01:28:18,190
she including the water jetting apollo
first have been

1370
01:28:18,190 --> 01:28:22,000
aside hearts and including firing up the
control system

1371
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:25,970
including reading this opportunity page

1372
01:28:25,970 --> 01:28:32,970
I and if it is a poor access hot wired

1373
01:28:59,230 --> 01:29:06,230
series

1374
01:29:12,990 --> 01:29:15,530
am I guess it's just so stressed

1375
01:29:15,530 --> 01:29:19,700
I love the machines that I'm showing you
here they show you up until now

1376
01:29:19,700 --> 01:29:22,930
are on that we're developing and I might
hear

1377
01:29:22,930 --> 01:29:26,340
are all open source and author I love
their

1378
01:29:26,340 --> 01:29:30,290
mechanical design files in the control
system everything is available online

1379
01:29:30,290 --> 01:29:33,350
and you getting the machines that make
project website am

1380
01:29:33,350 --> 01:29:37,460
and ninety a and I i think that we are
getting to a point where

1381
01:29:37,460 --> 01:29:40,560
personal fabrication tools are becoming
a thing that

1382
01:29:40,560 --> 01:29:45,400
companies are thinking about to am
instead of having instead of having this

1383
01:29:45,400 --> 01:29:46,110
model up

1384
01:29:46,110 --> 01:29:49,430
the shop where you make things am having
a having

1385
01:29:49,430 --> 01:29:52,850
fabrication equipment via a something
that you imagine

1386
01:29:52,850 --> 01:29:56,140
and individual having more like a power
tool

1387
01:29:56,140 --> 01:29:59,790
unless like machining center I'm so this
is a

1388
01:29:59,790 --> 01:30:03,490
align left the PhD program and started a
company

1389
01:30:03,490 --> 01:30:06,810
making this handheld digital fabrication
cool

1390
01:30:06,810 --> 01:30:10,820
router so has this Cape on the this tape
that you buy that

1391
01:30:10,820 --> 01:30:14,890
you put down on the material that all
recognize how far part anything is

1392
01:30:14,890 --> 01:30:18,820
and has webcam on it with her with a
small touchscreen interface

1393
01:30:18,820 --> 01:30:22,140
so you can say I want to be cutting out
I want to be cutting out

1394
01:30:22,140 --> 01:30:26,280
a a square here I want to cut this
complicated shape I don't have any of

1395
01:30:26,280 --> 01:30:27,610
you guys have ever used a

1396
01:30:27,610 --> 01:30:32,460
hand-held router before that for example
cutting a straight line with a handheld

1397
01:30:32,460 --> 01:30:34,250
router without a jig is pretty hard

1398
01:30:34,250 --> 01:30:37,400
I'm and because this has you have

1399
01:30:37,400 --> 01:30:41,750
gross global positioning with your hand
so you're the one dragging the entire

1400
01:30:41,750 --> 01:30:42,790
contraption around

1401
01:30:42,790 --> 01:30:46,530
but then inside their those two motors
formal linkage that can do precision

1402
01:30:46,530 --> 01:30:47,190
control

1403
01:30:47,190 --> 01:30:50,250
we have up the matter with in it so as
long as you stay within a certain

1404
01:30:50,250 --> 01:30:51,650
boundary area

1405
01:30:51,650 --> 01:30:55,120
it'll it will do the rest have the
control for you I'm

1406
01:30:55,120 --> 01:30:58,890
and a and really powerful thing about
this machine

1407
01:30:58,890 --> 01:31:02,960
ben is that this machine can make things
that are much much bigger than it is

1408
01:31:02,960 --> 01:31:06,380
resident other in other cases you go up
to a machine and you make something

1409
01:31:06,380 --> 01:31:08,650
that's smart in that machine but this
machine

1410
01:31:08,650 --> 01:31:12,070
applies the control through just these
like

1411
01:31:12,070 --> 01:31:15,080
custom inkjet printed masking tape

1412
01:31:15,080 --> 01:31:19,160
parts and done so I think that that
their every week setting direction

1413
01:31:19,160 --> 01:31:22,160
for digital fabrication tools to go in
also

1414
01:31:22,160 --> 01:31:26,000
her I don't have any ideas are used shop
by trotters

1415
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:29,580
inman maybe and so shy but is a is a

1416
01:31:29,580 --> 01:31:33,150
is a woodworking router company that
makes seen see Tables Ladders

1417
01:31:33,150 --> 01:31:36,940
and and then at some point there they go
you also actually want to do 5-axis

1418
01:31:36,940 --> 01:31:38,570
milling about things because

1419
01:31:38,570 --> 01:31:43,490
we need more we need more figurines and
stuff and I have hand

1420
01:31:43,490 --> 01:31:47,570
a and so they actually pretty type this
entire machine

1421
01:31:47,570 --> 01:31:51,590
the Haney by on a shop but as well so
they studied using

1422
01:31:51,590 --> 01:31:55,240
I'm these are using their tools to make
more twirls

1423
01:31:55,240 --> 01:31:58,690
us so that they could a so that they
could protect different now

1424
01:31:58,690 --> 01:32:01,880
different kinds over had different kinds
a

1425
01:32:01,880 --> 01:32:06,030
you're kinda equipment that people might
use in different contexts that are

1426
01:32:06,030 --> 01:32:07,710
necessary Taylor adding so this

1427
01:32:07,710 --> 01:32:11,620
henny but actually use it once where I
was at a

1428
01:32:11,620 --> 01:32:15,580
a dump like a a local garbage collection
and sorting area

1429
01:32:15,580 --> 01:32:18,740
and they wanted more sign in sheet and
so you can hold this up

1430
01:32:18,740 --> 01:32:22,390
against the side of a wall and then cut
things and cut signs into the wall

1431
01:32:22,390 --> 01:32:25,850
I am scan a bit more

1432
01:32:25,850 --> 01:32:29,650
more permanent some graffiti or
something kind of tool

1433
01:32:29,650 --> 01:32:33,130
a which I which i think is gonna an
exciting and exciting

1434
01:32:33,130 --> 01:32:36,510
spacehab dissolve our vacation to
explore on

1435
01:32:36,510 --> 01:32:40,450
so without am with the capability to can
have

1436
01:32:40,450 --> 01:32:43,620
iterate and design new digital
fabrication cause

1437
01:32:43,620 --> 01:32:48,040
I Irish like the ecosystem can grow your
you want to just end up having people

1438
01:32:48,040 --> 01:32:50,630
print things on the same 3d printers

1439
01:32:50,630 --> 01:32:53,440
because you're gonna end up with a lot
of stuff that looks the same its kinda

1440
01:32:53,440 --> 01:32:54,360
the same way as

1441
01:32:54,360 --> 01:33:00,370
if her kids these days just have I've
had similarities downloading absent I've

1442
01:33:00,370 --> 01:33:01,610
had and you can rate and

1443
01:33:01,610 --> 01:33:04,800
iPad application on an iPad or come I
guess if you jailbreak

1444
01:33:04,800 --> 01:33:08,120
you can compile an iPad application and
an iPad but there's no

1445
01:33:08,120 --> 01:33:11,390
there's no way that you can interface
with the technology that is a

1446
01:33:11,390 --> 01:33:15,010
that you're using a and so I think it's
really important thing

1447
01:33:15,010 --> 01:33:19,910
to think about and so another I realize
that not everyone hangs out

1448
01:33:19,910 --> 01:33:26,240
at might he in a in different kinds of
Fab Lab ish spaces with access to a 22

1449
01:33:26,240 --> 01:33:27,440
oz where they can prototype

1450
01:33:27,440 --> 01:33:30,930
I'm and so if you don't have access to
that water

1451
01:33:30,930 --> 01:33:34,320
other ways that you can build the
something I've been thinking about and

1452
01:33:34,320 --> 01:33:38,830
so what r whether what other forms of
access but you might have to you

1453
01:33:38,830 --> 01:33:42,570
precision manufacturing I'm so to

1454
01:33:42,570 --> 01:33:45,740
guesses question I went to you Shindand

1455
01:33:45,740 --> 01:33:50,480
which is just outside a Hong Kong and
it's kind of a hotbed us

1456
01:33:50,480 --> 01:33:53,640
but the right next to where foxconn is
it's where people do a lot about trying

1457
01:33:53,640 --> 01:33:55,290
to put the typing and a

1458
01:33:55,290 --> 01:33:58,580
it's where people do a lot of there's a
lot of small factories that you can get

1459
01:33:58,580 --> 01:34:00,290
to do custom jobs for you

1460
01:34:00,290 --> 01:34:03,830
it's a really strange place I thought it
was quite gotten and

1461
01:34:03,830 --> 01:34:07,370
as a city I think it's only maybe two
years older than me

1462
01:34:07,370 --> 01:34:10,880
and has a has a

1463
01:34:10,880 --> 01:34:14,780
I'm at 11 in Boston and and Boston takes
pride in having

1464
01:34:14,780 --> 01:34:18,300
the oldest subway system in the world

1465
01:34:18,300 --> 01:34:21,630
a dozen initially products really bad
for business and its way worse than York

1466
01:34:21,630 --> 01:34:22,890
Mets be bad to you

1467
01:34:22,890 --> 01:34:27,450
but in Shindand they have 8 beautiful
brand new subway system that they built

1468
01:34:27,450 --> 01:34:28,220
in the last

1469
01:34:28,220 --> 01:34:32,560
8 years that is much more expensive
spend the Boston greater

1470
01:34:32,560 --> 01:34:35,130
public transportation so it's a strange
place for people buildings really

1471
01:34:35,130 --> 01:34:36,000
quickly

1472
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:39,710
I'm seemingly out of thin air and you
have the slick

1473
01:34:39,710 --> 01:34:42,790
strange strange too and I shops for you

1474
01:34:42,790 --> 01:34:46,900
you come up in someone's eating like a
some had a pastry and and they ask you

1475
01:34:46,900 --> 01:34:47,920
do you want

1476
01:34:47,920 --> 01:34:51,700
you want a you want this kind of
potentiometer

1477
01:34:51,700 --> 01:34:55,730
I we all have that one but you can come
back in four minutes and we'll have

1478
01:34:55,730 --> 01:34:59,130
made it for you I'm and a

1479
01:34:59,130 --> 01:35:03,410
there these cell phone markets so since
I cell phones get made there this is

1480
01:35:03,410 --> 01:35:04,440
kinda

1481
01:35:04,440 --> 01:35:08,040
liminal area around the cell phone
market that

1482
01:35:08,040 --> 01:35:12,300
involve cell phone repair & he can buy
you can buy

1483
01:35:12,300 --> 01:35:15,310
all these digitizers if you want to buy
you know

1484
01:35:15,310 --> 01:35:18,330
I am don't like iPad so I'm sorry for

1485
01:35:18,330 --> 01:35:21,210
for harping on it but if you just want
the display itself is really nice rate

1486
01:35:21,210 --> 01:35:22,800
has really high pixel

1487
01:35:22,800 --> 01:35:25,950
count on if you just wanna buy the
display and

1488
01:35:25,950 --> 01:35:29,160
have your own little plug that you
interface with it you can buy one

1489
01:35:29,160 --> 01:35:33,570
at this can have not sure if still in
our founder

1490
01:35:33,570 --> 01:35:38,050
first sixty dollars you can get really
nice screens and other parts

1491
01:35:38,050 --> 01:35:43,550
the here are I'll un soldered I see is
that would go and my iPhone 5

1492
01:35:43,550 --> 01:35:47,850
I and hear banja iPhone motherboards

1493
01:35:47,850 --> 01:35:52,570
and so if you 1 a.m. for I calculated
approximately twelve dollars

1494
01:35:52,570 --> 01:35:55,800
you could make your own site a

1495
01:35:55,800 --> 01:36:00,380
the third not necessarily and easy thing
to do that right I mean

1496
01:36:00,380 --> 01:36:04,630
hi Mia I would say that I'm very skilled
at

1497
01:36:04,630 --> 01:36:09,100
surface mount soldering and the amount
of time it would take me to you

1498
01:36:09,100 --> 01:36:12,020
I think I would rather kill myself
inside a nice ass

1499
01:36:12,020 --> 01:36:15,260
a and so access to president woes

1500
01:36:15,260 --> 01:36:19,650
doesn't necessarily mean anything unless
you have the capability to use precision

1501
01:36:19,650 --> 01:36:20,730
two hours as well

1502
01:36:20,730 --> 01:36:24,540
so again with like the Mori Seiki that
we looked at the beginning with five

1503
01:36:24,540 --> 01:36:25,940
access control

1504
01:36:25,940 --> 01:36:29,220
on since programming that is such a pain

1505
01:36:29,220 --> 01:36:33,000
even if you say oh you're you're an
artist in you want to use this tool go

1506
01:36:33,000 --> 01:36:33,550
ahead

1507
01:36:33,550 --> 01:36:37,000
you can't really expect people to

1508
01:36:37,000 --> 01:36:42,150
invest 200 our reserve software training
into just being able to use the machine

1509
01:36:42,150 --> 01:36:45,120
and then still think that creative
things are going to come out but

1510
01:36:45,120 --> 01:36:49,150
it out there a lot of people that are
learning about how to use

1511
01:36:49,150 --> 01:36:52,710
a precision fabrication 20 so this is

1512
01:36:52,710 --> 01:36:56,500
I'm sending University which i think is

1513
01:36:56,500 --> 01:36:59,830
are managing was it was kinda more like
a vocational school

1514
01:36:59,830 --> 01:37:03,570
on where people were learning how to use
9 shanty can see

1515
01:37:03,570 --> 01:37:08,010
on the desks next to the students there
the small milling machines and every

1516
01:37:08,010 --> 01:37:09,400
student is learning about

1517
01:37:09,400 --> 01:37:15,180
g-code control on how to change their
parts correctly had to keep things clean

1518
01:37:15,180 --> 01:37:18,840
and then once they graduate from this
class they go to the next night machine

1519
01:37:18,840 --> 01:37:19,510
class

1520
01:37:19,510 --> 01:37:23,780
on the most are using these larger a
they start using his leg in nineteen so

1521
01:37:23,780 --> 01:37:24,170
there

1522
01:37:24,170 --> 01:37:27,530
there's a there's a vast expertise there

1523
01:37:27,530 --> 01:37:32,300
I've how to make things on and I think
there's a growing desire

1524
01:37:32,300 --> 01:37:35,360
for understanding why you want to be
making

1525
01:37:35,360 --> 01:37:39,720
different things and so there's like a
odd remixing that I observed that I

1526
01:37:39,720 --> 01:37:41,160
wanted to touch you guys that

1527
01:37:41,160 --> 01:37:44,780
a manufacturing things and things that
you might desire

1528
01:37:44,780 --> 01:37:48,420
in this space where people have and
learned how to

1529
01:37:48,420 --> 01:37:52,420
manufacture things and have been doing
them Annette Bening mentor waste

1530
01:37:52,420 --> 01:37:57,800
so here's a phone i buy a the form
factor might look kinda for Mary I paid

1531
01:37:57,800 --> 01:38:00,930
about 17 US dollars for it

1532
01:38:00,930 --> 01:38:04,830
and here it is next to a real I

1533
01:38:04,830 --> 01:38:08,030
and it's a it's like a skinned

1534
01:38:08,030 --> 01:38:11,840
Android OS that it's running I has
justice

1535
01:38:11,840 --> 01:38:15,900
the camp Chinese specific a ap son and

1536
01:38:15,900 --> 01:38:20,180
like we chat and QQ I'm unlike the
iPhone

1537
01:38:20,180 --> 01:38:23,720
you can change its battery a Eugene

1538
01:38:23,720 --> 01:38:26,840
had implements USB host a hadn't

1539
01:38:26,840 --> 01:38:30,140
I bet if you try hard not to get its
processor opcodes

1540
01:38:30,140 --> 01:38:35,860
I'm and so for some reason someone
mentioned then decided it would be a

1541
01:38:35,860 --> 01:38:39,420
good idea to design this can have many
cheap version

1542
01:38:39,420 --> 01:38:42,800
have something that was being designed
in California

1543
01:38:42,800 --> 01:38:46,790
I'm I also I as a X-rated to learn more
about its origins

1544
01:38:46,790 --> 01:38:52,050
a much I found that in China they really
know a lot about manufacturing things

1545
01:38:52,050 --> 01:38:53,590
really cheaply there's no

1546
01:38:53,590 --> 01:38:56,780
connectors connectors are expensive a
guess but there's no connectors and

1547
01:38:56,780 --> 01:38:57,650
they're just all

1548
01:38:57,650 --> 01:39:01,480
sandwiched together motherboard that
I've been tired together I'm

1549
01:39:01,480 --> 01:39:04,600
and so I think that that this this

1550
01:39:04,600 --> 01:39:09,260
this object is so what's a this object
is so

1551
01:39:09,260 --> 01:39:12,770
so here he is to me because it it kinda
represents

1552
01:39:12,770 --> 01:39:15,780
we have the capability to make whatever
we want we have

1553
01:39:15,780 --> 01:39:19,910
a we have the engineering hours to make
whatever we want and so what we decided

1554
01:39:19,910 --> 01:39:22,590
that we wanted was a kiss my cheaper
version on the iPhone

1555
01:39:22,590 --> 01:39:26,940
a so if we could harness that expertise
and put it into other things you know

1556
01:39:26,940 --> 01:39:28,470
how I think they can possibly a

1557
01:39:28,470 --> 01:39:32,750
be pretty cool here's another his mother
cell phone

1558
01:39:32,750 --> 01:39:37,020
we found this is a the prop she

1559
01:39:37,020 --> 01:39:40,730
crashed do a

1560
01:39:40,730 --> 01:39:44,580
which is even more like the Ferrari logo

1561
01:39:44,580 --> 01:39:46,020
I

1562
01:39:46,020 --> 01:39:50,170
but but yeah if it works great as a cell
phone and it came with like a gold

1563
01:39:50,170 --> 01:39:51,940
chains you can wear it around your neck

1564
01:39:51,940 --> 01:39:54,970
named I'm

1565
01:39:54,970 --> 01:39:58,830
and I guess the take away that I had
from that was like that

1566
01:39:58,830 --> 01:40:02,850
factors are a-changing and personal
fabrications growing even at the level

1567
01:40:02,850 --> 01:40:05,840
%uh workers in factories who think that
they understand more about the market

1568
01:40:05,840 --> 01:40:08,420
share that might be able to interface
with you can say

1569
01:40:08,420 --> 01:40:12,200
hey you know I think my friends might
want to buy a gold

1570
01:40:12,200 --> 01:40:15,460
trashy cell phone and a and so we're
gonna make it

1571
01:40:15,460 --> 01:40:19,070
I'm and I think that that kind of quick
turnaround of protecting is

1572
01:40:19,070 --> 01:40:23,460
it's pretty exciting but it's still not
necessarily something everyone can

1573
01:40:23,460 --> 01:40:24,190
calmer

1574
01:40:24,190 --> 01:40:27,530
along with and I don't know if jesse the

1575
01:40:27,530 --> 01:40:31,060
open source laptop and that money in
sobs designed

1576
01:40:31,060 --> 01:40:34,140
so it's a full a pair

1577
01:40:34,140 --> 01:40:37,740
it's like a a lot of is based on ARM
core that they

1578
01:40:37,740 --> 01:40:40,970
kick started this is an x-ray but I did
have it so that

1579
01:40:40,970 --> 01:40:44,030
should check to see if they're in any of
the clothes

1580
01:40:44,030 --> 01:40:47,810
chips there was any now where I'm not
really that

1581
01:40:47,810 --> 01:40:51,040
that worried about it but but

1582
01:40:51,040 --> 01:40:54,760
we know for sure now that there isn't
I'm in A&A a and they kick started this

1583
01:40:54,760 --> 01:40:55,530
summer

1584
01:40:55,530 --> 01:40:58,580
and they kick started this or crowd
supply-side

1585
01:40:58,580 --> 01:41:02,160
sorry this laptop am so that they would
be able to have

1586
01:41:02,160 --> 01:41:05,390
hackers laptop that was kind of like
this thing that they would use

1587
01:41:05,390 --> 01:41:08,860
I'm so specifications for it include

1588
01:41:08,860 --> 01:41:11,860
things that you expect in a laptop like
there's a certain amount memory you can

1589
01:41:11,860 --> 01:41:12,440
a

1590
01:41:12,440 --> 01:41:17,240
you can use it it but it's Debbie in I'm
but then there are the stretch goals

1591
01:41:17,240 --> 01:41:20,810
that the added so for example it also
has an add-on for software defined radio

1592
01:41:20,810 --> 01:41:24,410
so what your home GSM base station

1593
01:41:24,410 --> 01:41:27,710
no problem and it

1594
01:41:27,710 --> 01:41:32,530
I think that I am the cost to the laptop
is not necessarily representative for

1595
01:41:32,530 --> 01:41:33,640
its capabilities

1596
01:41:33,640 --> 01:41:37,600
I think that the base laptop was maybe
two thousand dollars which is more than

1597
01:41:37,600 --> 01:41:41,310
people generally spend on computational
devices right now but I think a

1598
01:41:41,310 --> 01:41:44,520
you look at the engineering that went
into it and the volumes that they're

1599
01:41:44,520 --> 01:41:45,510
constructing at

1600
01:41:45,510 --> 01:41:49,800
am I think that the way that I would see
this project much more is this is a

1601
01:41:49,800 --> 01:41:54,710
this isn't expiration those a good
journalism is an exploration where

1602
01:41:54,710 --> 01:41:58,630
ken is a possible for people to make
laptops

1603
01:41:58,630 --> 01:42:02,540
I'm that are completely open that don't
necessarily have a mass-market

1604
01:42:02,540 --> 01:42:05,880
that are designed to be fully hackable I
am

1605
01:42:05,880 --> 01:42:09,560
and how'd you do that so buddy and I
have been a

1606
01:42:09,560 --> 01:42:13,130
I have been working with manufacturers
in China

1607
01:42:13,130 --> 01:42:17,080
the same places brown hawking Bay Market
where they have the kind of

1608
01:42:17,080 --> 01:42:20,590
I'm cheap cell phone parts that you can
buy

1609
01:42:20,590 --> 01:42:24,440
am to figure out if you can do this
kinda small-scale manufacturing

1610
01:42:24,440 --> 01:42:28,290
and so can you can you circumvent a
large

1611
01:42:28,290 --> 01:42:31,620
electronics producers to make things
that maybe your mark personally

1612
01:42:31,620 --> 01:42:32,240
interested in

1613
01:42:32,240 --> 01:42:36,790
I think a the prequel project and so
with this new kind of them

1614
01:42:36,790 --> 01:42:40,440
they have this kind of new possibility
of making stuff

1615
01:42:40,440 --> 01:42:44,240
where you have access isn't individual
to material

1616
01:42:44,240 --> 01:42:47,890
you have axis is an individual to
engineering tools and you have access is

1617
01:42:47,890 --> 01:42:49,380
an individual 2 a.m.

1618
01:42:49,380 --> 01:42:53,130
her manufacturing equipment on I think
that

1619
01:42:53,130 --> 01:42:57,140
sourcing is a searching is one of the
big problems that you encounter

1620
01:42:57,140 --> 01:42:59,990
and so I guess that's one of the reasons
that I was pretty interest in going to

1621
01:42:59,990 --> 01:43:01,090
China and figuring out

1622
01:43:01,090 --> 01:43:05,130
where you can where can you go somewhere
find a street market in by

1623
01:43:05,130 --> 01:43:08,260
a and by a chip not

1624
01:43:08,260 --> 01:43:11,340
Radio Shack anymore army radio shack a
little bit

1625
01:43:11,340 --> 01:43:15,000
mostly you go to RadioShack in your
gonna buy in I a bit microcontroller

1626
01:43:15,000 --> 01:43:16,630
that is going to be able to run

1627
01:43:16,630 --> 01:43:20,140
not a whole it's not gonna be some it
not been replaced the device they are

1628
01:43:20,140 --> 01:43:20,990
using on the daily

1629
01:43:20,990 --> 01:43:25,810
on a daily basis with and a bit
microcontroller and so

1630
01:43:25,810 --> 01:43:29,690
here's I don't know if you guys have
heard of this website how bout a

1631
01:43:29,690 --> 01:43:34,560
but it's a its kinda a portal to start
interfacing with

1632
01:43:34,560 --> 01:43:38,850
small factories in China you can order
things just of tableau are you can start

1633
01:43:38,850 --> 01:43:41,050
communicating with sellers on Taobao

1634
01:43:41,050 --> 01:43:45,400
who then pubs manufacture things so for
example for that work shot

1635
01:43:45,400 --> 01:43:48,760
with that workshop that we tight 10
things that I wanted on the right you

1636
01:43:48,760 --> 01:43:50,600
can see Harry maybe you can almost Nazi

1637
01:43:50,600 --> 01:43:54,440
but on the radio on a custom been screw
motor assembly

1638
01:43:54,440 --> 01:43:57,600
with a specific kind of leads tonight so
that I would be able to move things

1639
01:43:57,600 --> 01:43:58,810
around in a certain way

1640
01:43:58,810 --> 01:44:01,920
and so I made a drying specification and
sent it to you

1641
01:44:01,920 --> 01:44:05,710
I am a manufacturer in China and then
was able

1642
01:44:05,710 --> 01:44:09,950
for the cost to seventeen dollars

1643
01:44:09,950 --> 01:44:13,510
a to get these a to get his precision

1644
01:44:13,510 --> 01:44:17,850
integrated lead screw my race with where
covers hitting the tree nuts from China

1645
01:44:17,850 --> 01:44:21,130
which I was very very excited about
because the

1646
01:44:21,130 --> 01:44:24,770
cooling cost if you would buy the
components to

1647
01:44:24,770 --> 01:44:29,010
combines off-the-shelf I'm would be
around 250 are so

1648
01:44:29,010 --> 01:44:32,690
making more more machines that her

1649
01:44:32,690 --> 01:44:36,680
mora but a more suitable for whatever it
is the purpose

1650
01:44:36,680 --> 01:44:39,520
whatever the purpose is that you wanna
make machines for and so it's pretty

1651
01:44:39,520 --> 01:44:39,950
much

1652
01:44:39,950 --> 01:44:43,800
I wanted to talk to you guys about a
thanks a lot for coming to my talk even

1653
01:44:43,800 --> 01:44:46,360
know Thomas Drake attacking rate over
there guys

1654
01:44:46,360 --> 01:44:49,440
I and you have any questions actually
have

1655
01:44:49,440 --> 01:44:52,650
sometime so miss yes

1656
01:44:52,650 --> 01:44:56,040
am oh yeah

1657
01:44:56,040 --> 01:45:00,430
horrible the Darfur rebel in town so we
we liked a lot of photos in the balloons

1658
01:45:00,430 --> 01:45:01,480
and maybe we like

1659
01:45:01,480 --> 01:45:05,060
change your ex if data and then we
posted them on different places

1660
01:45:05,060 --> 01:45:08,760
and I definitely think we threw off we
threw off the trail

1661
01:45:08,760 --> 01:45:12,550
we threw something of a trail if I knew
it but 10 hours later there is another

1662
01:45:12,550 --> 01:45:16,310
there's another group and at MIT who
were

1663
01:45:16,310 --> 01:45:20,160
lovely people hand they created this
kind of

1664
01:45:20,160 --> 01:45:24,100
the kind of kid a social platform where
you can invite I love your friends

1665
01:45:24,100 --> 01:45:27,170
I'm and they could invite their friends
and they can invite your friends and if

1666
01:45:27,170 --> 01:45:28,670
one of your friends found

1667
01:45:28,670 --> 01:45:31,320
a balloon they would get a thousand
dollars and you would get a five hundred

1668
01:45:31,320 --> 01:45:32,700
ice referring them

1669
01:45:32,700 --> 01:45:35,850
and then that you get turned fifty
dollars for freeman et cetera et cetera

1670
01:45:35,850 --> 01:45:37,090
so they created this

1671
01:45:37,090 --> 01:45:41,950
massive unregulated experiment where the
collected huge amounts in information

1672
01:45:41,950 --> 01:45:43,920
about people's personal networks

1673
01:45:43,920 --> 01:45:47,150
and people are just kinda did I was
really pissed about that because

1674
01:45:47,150 --> 01:45:50,870
has acquired by just giving up all the
people that you know but not a

1675
01:45:50,870 --> 01:45:53,860
is not something that you just wanna
give to our researcher without knowing

1676
01:45:53,860 --> 01:45:55,300
what the research agenda is

1677
01:45:55,300 --> 01:45:59,880
but it took them using that model I took
them nine hours to win the balloon

1678
01:45:59,880 --> 01:46:00,700
challenge

1679
01:46:00,700 --> 01:46:04,360
and so they wanna forty thousand dollars
which then they had to pay out into this

1680
01:46:04,360 --> 01:46:06,730
massive unregulated human excrement

1681
01:46:06,730 --> 01:46:10,490
I mean they're invited too and then
never invited to speak at

1682
01:46:10,490 --> 01:46:14,990
a on The Tonight Show or something and
and they came down the king and allowed

1683
01:46:14,990 --> 01:46:16,280
me said are you know

1684
01:46:16,280 --> 01:46:20,280
have you heard about this we won we
wonder red/blue challenge now we're

1685
01:46:20,280 --> 01:46:23,280
gonna be on the Today sure the show
every exactly in a good

1686
01:46:23,280 --> 01:46:26,320
and we want to make sure that everybody
knows that we're scientists so we're

1687
01:46:26,320 --> 01:46:28,870
wondering if you could lend us a lab
coat

1688
01:46:28,870 --> 01:46:34,170
don't

1689
01:46:34,170 --> 01:46:37,800
and then I said well I really did take
issue with

1690
01:46:37,800 --> 01:46:40,820
the way that you've approached this
experiment and I would like you to know

1691
01:46:40,820 --> 01:46:42,970
that I'm extremely cross with you

1692
01:46:42,970 --> 01:46:47,370
and they said so will you into the lab
delay

1693
01:46:47,370 --> 01:46:51,770
so then I let them a lab coat and a I
have letter released occupied post about

1694
01:46:51,770 --> 01:46:53,150
it and i think im now

1695
01:46:53,150 --> 01:46:56,650
featured in their presentation about
this wonderful

1696
01:46:56,650 --> 01:47:00,530
make social social connection mining

1697
01:47:00,530 --> 01:47:04,400
experiment as as like the technological
lead a and the person that is opposing

1698
01:47:04,400 --> 01:47:05,130
change

1699
01:47:05,130 --> 01:47:08,470
because obviously there on the path of
smartness

1700
01:47:08,470 --> 01:47:14,950
and if you're not part of smart
connected devices must be done

1701
01:47:14,950 --> 01:47:18,810
yeah

1702
01:47:18,810 --> 01:47:23,020
anyone else have any other questions can
tell you all about how to

1703
01:47:23,020 --> 01:47:28,450
make networked control systems okay

1704
01:47:28,450 --> 01:47:32,620
a into decoden a so there's

1705
01:47:32,620 --> 01:47:37,800
then go back to this peterman year

1706
01:47:37,800 --> 01:47:40,830
are using something called gestalt

1707
01:47:40,830 --> 01:47:44,120
which we wrote ourselves I'm and

1708
01:47:44,120 --> 01:47:47,260
it go back I

1709
01:47:47,260 --> 01:47:51,530
so the a the nodes

1710
01:47:51,530 --> 01:47:55,960
individually are running Embedded CE to
interpret

1711
01:47:55,960 --> 01:47:59,300
am so the nodes the nodes in the a

1712
01:47:59,300 --> 01:48:02,360
know that control 1 sensor 1 actuator
each

1713
01:48:02,360 --> 01:48:05,640
are running Embedded CE and that
embedded C listens to

1714
01:48:05,640 --> 01:48:09,520
a bus network protocol every kind fab
bus which runs

1715
01:48:09,520 --> 01:48:13,370
both over RS 485 and over

1716
01:48:13,370 --> 01:48:17,150
other communication dependent depending
on what communication networks your

1717
01:48:17,150 --> 01:48:19,660
machine may already have access to you
there's different know it's been for

1718
01:48:19,660 --> 01:48:20,010
them

1719
01:48:20,010 --> 01:48:23,820
so you a you can write an application
say a

1720
01:48:23,820 --> 01:48:27,330
you have like a browser we have a a

1721
01:48:27,330 --> 01:48:31,130
we have a a we have one browser-based

1722
01:48:31,130 --> 01:48:34,470
application that a listen for things
from the browser

1723
01:48:34,470 --> 01:48:37,810
and then send them as packets over this
fab us

1724
01:48:37,810 --> 01:48:41,430
and and then each individual node will
interpret those commands

1725
01:48:41,430 --> 01:48:44,890
and you can write those commands
yourself so instead of saying I'll

1726
01:48:44,890 --> 01:48:48,540
she ninety 2000 machine goes home

1727
01:48:48,540 --> 01:48:51,810
I'm you can just write us you we can
write a you can write a function that

1728
01:48:51,810 --> 01:48:52,200
says

1729
01:48:52,200 --> 01:48:55,420
home and then each node on the network

1730
01:48:55,420 --> 01:48:59,580
knows where its machine home is and
we'll just move back to that location

1731
01:48:59,580 --> 01:49:04,170
%uh and if you the one thing that you
don't know that word that we didn't

1732
01:49:04,170 --> 01:49:05,460
necessarily want to do is

1733
01:49:05,460 --> 01:49:09,060
tell everyone that was using G code that
they couldn't use to cut any more so if

1734
01:49:09,060 --> 01:49:12,160
you want you can stream g-code over the
fab us as well

1735
01:49:12,160 --> 01:49:15,230
I'll still as long as you've specified
what

1736
01:49:15,230 --> 01:49:19,740
each year what each distances in in
g-code else to move to the left to the

1737
01:49:19,740 --> 01:49:20,420
right places

1738
01:49:20,420 --> 01:49:23,570
but yet that the system they're using
his comp dished out

1739
01:49:23,570 --> 01:49:27,750
we have it up and get help if you want
to take a look at it them

1740
01:49:27,750 --> 01:49:31,380
yes is 1

1741
01:49:31,380 --> 01:49:32,970
go

1742
01:49:32,970 --> 01:49:35,790
soon

1743
01:49:35,790 --> 01:49:42,790
I am home

1744
01:49:44,290 --> 01:49:47,560
rate nominee

1745
01:49:47,560 --> 01:49:49,030
rim

1746
01:49:49,030 --> 01:49:51,130
X

1747
01:49:51,130 --> 01:49:54,119
yet I think that the a

1748
01:49:54,119 --> 01:49:57,159
I think there is a really good point and
a half and a

1749
01:49:57,159 --> 01:50:00,549
fully agree with you one other things
that a I guess I find it frustrating

1750
01:50:00,549 --> 01:50:01,189
about

1751
01:50:01,189 --> 01:50:04,959
spaces like MIT is that people always
act like people are act like

1752
01:50:04,959 --> 01:50:08,030
the thing that you're learning is the
technology year thing that you're

1753
01:50:08,030 --> 01:50:11,479
like this you go to a maker space the
thing that you're there for is the 3d

1754
01:50:11,479 --> 01:50:11,919
printer

1755
01:50:11,919 --> 01:50:15,459
this repeatedly quite useless unless
there's someone there

1756
01:50:15,459 --> 01:50:19,369
that can help you learn about the three
maybe you wanna learn

1757
01:50:19,369 --> 01:50:22,709
about it through the Internet or maybe
you wanna learn about it from a book

1758
01:50:22,709 --> 01:50:25,709
but at the end like there something you
have to find someone even if it was

1759
01:50:25,709 --> 01:50:26,859
someone else to learn about it

1760
01:50:26,859 --> 01:50:30,119
on so I guess there's which two things
that I'm trying to do to address that

1761
01:50:30,119 --> 01:50:31,019
problem and one is

1762
01:50:31,019 --> 01:50:35,719
you can talk to me for example I and
public people like me so they could seek

1763
01:50:35,719 --> 01:50:36,189
out

1764
01:50:36,189 --> 01:50:40,010
seek out other people in your community
that I'm are excited about

1765
01:50:40,010 --> 01:50:44,369
digital fabrication and then is one of
the things that we're trying to do with

1766
01:50:44,369 --> 01:50:45,489
the fab us and

1767
01:50:45,489 --> 01:50:48,719
these control system networks is to make
it much easier

1768
01:50:48,719 --> 01:50:51,939
to make machines on

1769
01:50:51,939 --> 01:50:55,619
and a and so not just by teaching people
how to build machines but also by

1770
01:50:55,619 --> 01:50:58,099
changing the tools with which they can
build machines

1771
01:50:58,099 --> 01:51:01,769
so for example in September we're going
to

1772
01:51:01,769 --> 01:51:06,280
and have some our church for students at
University of Kansas

1773
01:51:06,280 --> 01:51:10,199
on play around with building building
machine systems from

1774
01:51:10,199 --> 01:51:13,819
from the from the network to mission
controllers I am

1775
01:51:13,819 --> 01:51:17,429
but I realize that maybe not a very
satisfactory personal answered here

1776
01:51:17,429 --> 01:51:22,519
your your question personally but you
them

1777
01:51:22,519 --> 01:51:25,839
yeah that's a great idea its

1778
01:51:25,839 --> 01:51:30,929
the yeah im

1779
01:51:30,929 --> 01:51:32,400
which stuff

1780
01:51:32,400 --> 01:51:36,400
the network node so that the board's

1781
01:51:36,400 --> 01:51:39,520
them the

1782
01:51:39,520 --> 01:51:42,810
the whole machine or just the the
control system nodes

1783
01:51:42,810 --> 01:51:46,710
so all other I love the design files are
online

1784
01:51:46,710 --> 01:51:50,030
I'm but you can't buy it needed boards
pre-assembled but

1785
01:51:50,030 --> 01:51:53,270
the design as better remind you could
buy the board an insider yourself with a

1786
01:51:53,270 --> 01:51:55,560
religious man or a satisfactory answer
either

1787
01:51:55,560 --> 01:52:01,090
hun a in home

1788
01:52:01,090 --> 01:52:05,920
get I guess the one maybe he can weeks
like a year

1789
01:52:05,920 --> 01:52:11,170
maybe one day I'll graduate in homework
much pressure and

1790
01:52:11,170 --> 01:52:18,170
yet okay yeah yes

1791
01:52:27,220 --> 01:52:28,870
home

1792
01:52:28,870 --> 01:52:30,739
%um

1793
01:52:30,739 --> 01:52:32,300
a good name

1794
01:52:32,300 --> 01:52:38,250
I

1795
01:52:38,250 --> 01:52:41,410
yeah

1796
01:52:41,410 --> 01:52:43,180
great

1797
01:52:43,180 --> 01:52:48,490
why way

1798
01:52:48,490 --> 01:52:51,870
well I guess a if you're worried about
it

1799
01:52:51,870 --> 01:52:55,300
if you're worried about the security of
your machine

1800
01:52:55,300 --> 01:52:59,340
and then it's nice that Chico didn't
ring complete language busy because you

1801
01:52:59,340 --> 01:53:01,520
can execute code on it but

1802
01:53:01,520 --> 01:53:05,080
I think that if I have I have like this

1803
01:53:05,080 --> 01:53:08,320
I have this photograph I took a a friend
of mine

1804
01:53:08,320 --> 01:53:11,610
has using a7 X's row but I'm I'm

1805
01:53:11,610 --> 01:53:14,850
and he's using it to cut star from
services

1806
01:53:14,850 --> 01:53:19,120
and the star from service is a very
complicated apology in sick

1807
01:53:19,120 --> 01:53:23,270
it's like a full 90 August encourage her
that he's trying to approximate with

1808
01:53:23,270 --> 01:53:26,450
sweeps back and forth and this would

1809
01:53:26,450 --> 01:53:31,100
motion that goes back and forth is fine
he can program that I N G code in have

1810
01:53:31,100 --> 01:53:35,440
I'm the Cougar robot arm interpret the
corn is that it's ending to it

1811
01:53:35,440 --> 01:53:39,360
but he's standing next to the robot and
this is what I think is striking about

1812
01:53:39,360 --> 01:53:40,340
the photograph

1813
01:53:40,340 --> 01:53:43,910
the standing next to the robot and is
controlling the temperature of the hot

1814
01:53:43,910 --> 01:53:48,210
armed that's cutting the styrofoam I
hope king and he hooked it up to a surge

1815
01:53:48,210 --> 01:53:48,940
protector

1816
01:53:48,940 --> 01:53:52,080
and has a surge protector in his hand
and is flipping a switch

1817
01:53:52,080 --> 01:53:55,740
often on with his thumb is a standing
next to the machine

1818
01:53:55,740 --> 01:54:00,610
and be easiest way for him to interface
with that machine system and change

1819
01:54:00,610 --> 01:54:01,790
something about the machine

1820
01:54:01,790 --> 01:54:06,400
is to put a hard stop in and control it
by turning it off and on with his thumb

1821
01:54:06,400 --> 01:54:10,300
funds are pretty expensive and that's
like this it is it's a frustrating

1822
01:54:10,300 --> 01:54:14,990
you could get around it with a light
enough

1823
01:54:14,990 --> 01:54:18,340
if you wrote if you wrote an embedded
controller that

1824
01:54:18,340 --> 01:54:22,970
took and something that you decided to
specify within the g-code

1825
01:54:22,970 --> 01:54:26,450
as on an off added transistor to

1826
01:54:26,450 --> 01:54:29,760
a the at transistor that would turn off
and on

1827
01:54:29,760 --> 01:54:32,890
the Hotwire for you and

1828
01:54:32,890 --> 01:54:36,110
recompile your controller box firmware

1829
01:54:36,110 --> 01:54:40,130
put that on the controller box and then
talk to that from some software that you

1830
01:54:40,130 --> 01:54:41,020
custom road

1831
01:54:41,020 --> 01:54:44,060
men yes you could do that however

1832
01:54:44,060 --> 01:54:51,060
I think it's a waste your time

1833
01:54:53,989 --> 01:54:55,320
that

1834
01:54:55,320 --> 01:54:58,329
them I

1835
01:54:58,329 --> 01:55:01,500
it it's not it smart he said he said

1836
01:55:01,500 --> 01:55:04,780
if I don't want someone to come up and
say I want to build something

1837
01:55:04,780 --> 01:55:09,010
and I don't have time have time to lick

1838
01:55:09,010 --> 01:55:12,760
pack all these existing systems is can
take me too long I'm gonna go

1839
01:55:12,760 --> 01:55:15,820
I'm gonna work on something else that's
not fabrication engineering

1840
01:55:15,820 --> 01:55:21,230
%um I did you guys know Travis Goodspeed
the guy who organize never time so he

1841
01:55:21,230 --> 01:55:22,880
did that thing with the satellite

1842
01:55:22,880 --> 01:55:26,369
are a trip had a satellite dish a was
pointing around in different places

1843
01:55:26,369 --> 01:55:30,040
insensitive using the control box that
he had in the satellite dish which

1844
01:55:30,040 --> 01:55:31,780
probably would listen to decode

1845
01:55:31,780 --> 01:55:35,389
I'm see she kinda repurposed he
repurposed the

1846
01:55:35,389 --> 01:55:38,630
the internal server and eg bot

1847
01:55:38,630 --> 01:55:42,469
so the thing but little little Doohickey
machine that draws on

1848
01:55:42,469 --> 01:55:46,579
easter eggs I'm that was the easiest way
for him to interface with that system

1849
01:55:46,579 --> 01:55:50,409
and she happens to be a very tenacious
kinda guy who's okay with

1850
01:55:50,409 --> 01:55:53,670
taking out an entire control system
writing

1851
01:55:53,670 --> 01:55:57,130
writing firmware for a new control
system in hooking it up to you

1852
01:55:57,130 --> 01:56:00,420
a satellite dish and then looking at
different kinds and stars

1853
01:56:00,420 --> 01:56:04,420
but I think that I am the robe you a
better place if more people

1854
01:56:04,420 --> 01:56:11,370
could do things like Travis Goodspeed
yes

1855
01:56:11,370 --> 01:56:14,989
so

1856
01:56:14,989 --> 01:56:21,989
and

1857
01:56:22,219 --> 01:56:25,640
said

1858
01:56:25,640 --> 01:56:32,639
yeah I'll up people

1859
01:56:32,639 --> 01:56:39,639
but I up

1860
01:56:40,650 --> 01:56:43,219
me lay

1861
01:56:43,219 --> 01:56:50,219
we us

1862
01:56:50,850 --> 01:56:54,050
me

1863
01:56:54,050 --> 01:56:56,200
yeah

1864
01:56:56,200 --> 01:56:58,690
well

1865
01:56:58,690 --> 01:57:03,019
year

1866
01:57:03,019 --> 01:57:05,130
me

1867
01:57:05,130 --> 01:57:06,090
yeah

1868
01:57:06,090 --> 01:57:10,630
right now

1869
01:57:10,630 --> 01:57:14,050
I think good a because the portals like

1870
01:57:14,050 --> 01:57:18,990
how well and other can internet media
very interfaces it's getting a lot

1871
01:57:18,990 --> 01:57:23,850
easier to buy things so before about
those motors in Shenzhen

1872
01:57:23,850 --> 01:57:27,070
I also by motors from hidden switch

1873
01:57:27,070 --> 01:57:30,220
I am him Kirk switch coke which is an

1874
01:57:30,220 --> 01:57:33,830
Connecticut I'm and a and the lead times

1875
01:57:33,830 --> 01:57:36,840
for their mothers are actually much
longer than the lead times including

1876
01:57:36,840 --> 01:57:39,420
shipping for the murders that you are
friends and then

1877
01:57:39,420 --> 01:57:44,010
so I think that I am there's like an
argument you to make that really been a

1878
01:57:44,010 --> 01:57:45,960
cosmopolitan society where we have

1879
01:57:45,960 --> 01:57:49,520
rapid access to different places in the
world

1880
01:57:49,520 --> 01:57:53,420
have different pockets of expertise am
and a

1881
01:57:53,420 --> 01:57:57,360
I realize that it also is maybe not a
super

1882
01:57:57,360 --> 01:58:00,140
your concern if you're concerned about
you know that the american economy

1883
01:58:00,140 --> 01:58:02,590
perhaps you don't want things to be

1884
01:58:02,590 --> 01:58:07,200
manufactured abroad I'm but for me those
are just a question of

1885
01:58:07,200 --> 01:58:11,020
where can you get where can you get
tools

1886
01:58:11,020 --> 01:58:15,510
materials and parts that are to the
specification that you need

1887
01:58:15,510 --> 01:58:19,110
at a price that you can afford on in the
time line that

1888
01:58:19,110 --> 01:58:22,320
you have available to you and so so

1889
01:58:22,320 --> 01:58:26,230
sorry I think I think it's complicated I
think that moving

1890
01:58:26,230 --> 01:58:29,580
moving closer to Anna to the a

1891
01:58:29,580 --> 01:58:34,760
and moving closer to working together
with Moscow manufacturers in China is

1892
01:58:34,760 --> 01:58:36,810
definitely direction I think that we're
going in

1893
01:58:36,810 --> 01:58:39,990
and I'm pretty excited about it maybe
Obama's not excited about it

1894
01:58:39,990 --> 01:58:43,320
%um

1895
01:58:43,320 --> 01:58:46,480
it close it so I know

1896
01:58:46,480 --> 01:58:46,730
acts
