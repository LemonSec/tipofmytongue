backgrounds and the Dutch

19
00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:18,159
agriculture and today we're going to
talk about diversity

20
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:22,759
a issues around up and so must my cues
must stop I know ours

21
00:01:22,759 --> 00:01:27,250
from the backgrounds I am so something's

25
00:01:39,729 --> 00:01:43,689
like how does netflix on a smile nice I

26
00:01:43,689 --> 00:01:47,530

a.m. and I mean it does in a special way
for you guys here

31
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:06,360
we like a tech-savvy people I think we
are a little bit more fart

32
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:10,349
then duress in the world's black guys
guys

33
00:02:10,349 --> 00:02:14,060
you know in I know it by 10 for
breakfast guys

34
00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:17,750
foreign girls who can help their way out

35
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:21,700
very it's four mile deep in the desert
love you to I am

36
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:25,870
regal like a big responsibility and on
about ourselves

37
00:02:25,870 --> 00:02:29,690
not only a few gonna we have to save
ourselves but we also got a

38
00:02:29,690 --> 00:02:31,170
responsibility to say

39
00:02:31,170 --> 00:02:36,660
a everybody else you know Tiger I'm not
a guy who makes a pizza or doctors are

40
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:37,269
mom

41
00:02:37,269 --> 00:02:40,840
I all this people are looking at us as
saying

42
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:44,379
really need you to engineer

43
00:02:44,379 --> 00:02:47,980
our way out of this mess I am

44
00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:52,879
we have to save them basically to save
ourselves

45
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:56,580
so I tried to do a little bit older but
I give

46
00:02:56,580 --> 00:02:59,739
a gif other loquitur parties like an arm
some

47
00:02:59,739 --> 00:03:05,640
Public Library I am I tried to say on
top of the latest news sorry my left aka

48
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:10,269
never post to read though sleuths
carried a list and I got the European

49
00:03:10,269 --> 00:03:13,060
100 km sorry just starting my own story
larry

50
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:17,280
year well my Raspberry Pi but I contact
my way

51
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:22,290
even out over paperback and the year of
the snow tonight more and more ensure

52
00:03:22,290 --> 00:03:26,750
if any of this stuff makes any sense at
all if I look at the amount of troops

53
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:28,280
and newt I have to jump through

54
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:31,780
tonight showed my security just even a
little bit

55
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:35,340
a I really wanna like how

56
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:39,150
are my mom my doctor and my favorite
pizza maker

57
00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:43,120
ever gonna do this are gonna do pull it
together power to Canada's

58
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:48,000
defend themselves from the closet
massive valence and I know so you have

59
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:48,650
answers

60
00:03:48,650 --> 00:03:53,450
like many of your many answers actually
and salad and forth like a great deal of

61
00:03:53,450 --> 00:03:55,310
the same abbreviation lingo

62
00:03:55,310 --> 00:03:59,680
that we know from the leaks you know
your people saying we just have to otro

63
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:00,680
for TLS

64
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:04,049
using PFS and you store to exchange a
PGP

65
00:04:04,049 --> 00:04:07,049
right wrong

66
00:04:07,049 --> 00:04:11,129
or no not again and no that's right we
have to do not ship rabbi I love it

67
00:04:11,129 --> 00:04:14,299
you know that's great that's that's
literally words a

68
00:04:14,299 --> 00:04:17,959
we have to do but it's not enough for us

69
00:04:17,959 --> 00:04:23,009
a reactor otro over TLS would be a first
order pizza

70
00:04:23,009 --> 00:04:28,150
refuse store to order medicine and we
for sure like how issues bitch be to

71
00:04:28,150 --> 00:04:29,360
communicate with her mom

72
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:33,680
we have to get this to sue them to make
sure that we can be safe

73
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:38,830
if they're not going to use it we're
gonna stand out like a sore from

74
00:04:38,830 --> 00:04:42,820
because really only one and i'm having
our security to

75
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:47,750
like a good level a decent level so what
is talks about is

76
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:51,280
that we need to diversify ever gonna
save ourselves

77
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:55,130
we need to have diversity in our
community

78
00:04:55,130 --> 00:04:59,030
because we have to make tools beers make
sure to tools remade can be used by a

79
00:04:59,030 --> 00:05:01,840
baker's doctors a mom's

80
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:06,280
so could it be that most the tools we
make are not being used by them

81
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:10,530
because redesign them for ourselves and
for our close friends

82
00:05:10,530 --> 00:05:15,270
like when was the last time you try you
ask a little brother to run your code

83
00:05:15,270 --> 00:05:19,960
when you ask your grandma to fire up the
program it is just me

84
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:23,289
like when was the last time for
everybody was running as our mail server

85
00:05:23,289 --> 00:05:24,100
like

86
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:27,240
when was the last time you looked into
webmail interface

87
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:30,970
that eighty percent of users are using

88
00:05:30,970 --> 00:05:36,039
sorry did you select design in my belief
that once we're going to use programs

89
00:05:36,039 --> 00:05:40,919
must be part of the design and
development process from the start

90
00:05:40,919 --> 00:05:44,669
reads a notice people are going to use
her go to save lives on the other side

91
00:05:44,669 --> 00:05:46,060
door of

92
00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:50,509
many of us don't have to do research
budgets Google or to Facebook's

93
00:05:50,509 --> 00:05:54,220
to get an exact profile to whims and
wishes serve our users

94
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:58,210
so we have to meet him face to face we
have to meet with them

95
00:05:58,210 --> 00:06:01,699
tune with the needs every need to be
part of their struggles

96
00:06:01,699 --> 00:06:05,350
an order stories so we need to diversify

97
00:06:05,350 --> 00:06:09,330
also because there's no one solution
there are people who say we need

98
00:06:09,330 --> 00:06:10,669
technical solutions

99
00:06:10,669 --> 00:06:13,910
there are people we save any political
solutions

100
00:06:13,910 --> 00:06:17,360
and just maybe in your apt word excerpt
group so won't solve anything

101
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:21,250
if your politics is down the drain

102
00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:24,500
but only policía political solutions 1
work either

103
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:28,610
a and then our site /a a referee rightly
pointed out in our talk at the noises

104
00:06:28,610 --> 00:06:29,780
square at home

105
00:06:29,780 --> 00:06:32,810
after camp last year an army of people
were there

106
00:06:32,810 --> 00:06:37,130
I know quite a few a but what she said
is dad's

107
00:06:37,130 --> 00:06:42,410
from there once basically we're not
gonna policy is in place in a political

108
00:06:42,410 --> 00:06:43,580
level

109
00:06:43,580 --> 00:06:47,509
it doesn't disappear anymore sure
memorize

110
00:06:47,509 --> 00:06:52,150
one occasion and a quarter on it she
said the NSA this very politely in

111
00:06:52,150 --> 00:06:53,220
ninety-seven

112
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:56,930
frightened 9075 turn off the telegram

113
00:06:56,930 --> 00:07:01,210
surveillance program it had never been

114
00:07:01,210 --> 00:07:04,639
is that never in their entire history
produced anything useful

115
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:08,080
so this are one example over
technological capability

116
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:12,599
being rolled back so much for history

117
00:07:12,599 --> 00:07:15,919
furthermore you have an additional
problem here and once again this is

118
00:07:15,919 --> 00:07:17,919
trade routes from Allah

119
00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:21,490
she says Dennis eight types every
politician's email

120
00:07:21,490 --> 00:07:24,620
and even anybody who might become a
politician but up their phones that a

121
00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:25,620
very mellow

122
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:28,810
parts repair better it is for national
security reasons

123
00:07:28,810 --> 00:07:32,039
they need to know if these people are
sold out to somebody

124
00:07:32,039 --> 00:07:37,270
or any number justifications but it also
means today are all the dirt on you

125
00:07:37,270 --> 00:07:40,539
all the polluter overall ability a
politician's

126
00:07:40,539 --> 00:07:43,840
now how easy do you think it is to give
a politician balls

127
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:46,949
if their carrier can be destroyed at any
moment

128
00:07:46,949 --> 00:07:51,120
how well do you think their long-term
policy will go is going to be

129
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:56,789
when they know that if they stand up to
you too much they get the street

130
00:07:56,789 --> 00:08:00,009
so we need to diversify to fight off a
little better medals

131
00:08:00,009 --> 00:08:03,530
internationally and I'm sorry to say but
I have more freights

132
00:08:03,530 --> 00:08:06,780
at this moment in Germany Poland the
Netherlands I'm

133
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:10,050
maybe even Brazil and is regarded the US

134
00:08:10,050 --> 00:08:13,789
but we need to help a view to give our
government in check

135
00:08:13,789 --> 00:08:18,129
really re you renewed give our position
checks also %um

136
00:08:18,129 --> 00:08:22,180
safe place to hide read in international
coalitions and show the US for

137
00:08:22,180 --> 00:08:23,449
international pressure

138
00:08:23,449 --> 00:08:27,949
but they are backwards in destroying it
only businesses but freedom at large

139
00:08:27,949 --> 00:08:31,259
really diverse city because many of us

140
00:08:31,259 --> 00:08:35,409
a business circle jerking an echo
chamber

141
00:08:35,409 --> 00:08:39,529
and sorry to be personal but is a shout
out to make some money in spike

142
00:08:39,529 --> 00:08:43,279
was making great stuff lecture secure
and rats phone

143
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:47,519
but two weeks ago you find it necessary
to call out on Twitter asking people not

144
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:49,550
to fund group accounts for Android

145
00:08:49,550 --> 00:08:54,850
but I stance France his project and what
is works great as standard police just

146
00:08:54,850 --> 00:08:56,209
messing around

147
00:08:56,209 --> 00:08:59,410
they might even be right to death but
the finger it's good to have just one

148
00:08:59,410 --> 00:09:01,070
crypto ap

149
00:09:01,070 --> 00:09:05,630
and on multiple is beyond me anyone with
some basic understanding of biology

150
00:09:05,630 --> 00:09:09,010
knows where monoculture commune in a
time of crisis

151
00:09:09,010 --> 00:09:12,130
renewed many different tools and in many
different people we need to make sure

152
00:09:12,130 --> 00:09:14,070
that everybody dies

153
00:09:14,070 --> 00:09:17,550
when one heart bleeds

154
00:09:17,550 --> 00:09:20,660
so many diverse T because we're going to
die

155
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:24,450
and I mean that literally renewed
coaters during Journalism Review Journal

156
00:09:24,450 --> 00:09:28,230
escorting read activist doctors lawyers
teachers civil surgeons

157
00:09:28,230 --> 00:09:31,360
and even the prong business
understanding their jobs

158
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:36,510
will become impossible without security
and privacy

159
00:09:36,510 --> 00:09:39,800
I also don't see dozers opposing things
with many people would like to frame it

160
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:40,209
both

161
00:09:40,209 --> 00:09:44,480
you can have privacy without security in
the other way around

162
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:48,790
we're going to target ads and 100 in
smoke out over mangoes

163
00:09:48,790 --> 00:09:53,019
like xkcd says we're going to drugs and
be done with a five dollar crank

164
00:09:53,019 --> 00:09:57,850
and 4,096 bit errors encryption will not
sign up for us

165
00:09:57,850 --> 00:10:02,579
so we need to diversify and open up our
communities to LGBT community to Syrian

166
00:10:02,579 --> 00:10:04,510
fighters are just academics

167
00:10:04,510 --> 00:10:07,600
and Mexicans trying to defend themselves
against drug cartels

168
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:11,000
read understand their struggles to
empower them

169
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,120
and they are ready they want to

170
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:17,930
there was a reason call for academic
papers to mathematicians

171
00:10:17,930 --> 00:10:21,380
and the NSA only on the so its subject
of an essay

172
00:10:21,380 --> 00:10:24,500
manager so this submission scoring
titles like

173
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:27,740
mathematician should severe ties with
the NSA

174
00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:31,750
and there is a long-term security
depends on freedom

175
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:35,990
and then as a back door to an ISD

176
00:10:35,990 --> 00:10:40,720
and this year every major art academy in
a maryland says students graduating

177
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:44,649
retard works dealing with privacy
surveillance and technology

178
00:10:44,649 --> 00:10:49,829
Syrians fighting both viruses and
Assad's wants and needs to mesh networks

179
00:10:49,829 --> 00:10:53,130
and pizza bakers want an all-out effort
or in service

180
00:10:53,130 --> 00:10:57,089
delivery service accepting bets going
they are ready to make

181
00:10:57,089 --> 00:11:00,310
our knowledge and craftmanship global

182
00:11:00,310 --> 00:11:04,050
and nose art us to be ready and make
sure we can welcome other ideas cultures

183
00:11:04,050 --> 00:11:05,480
and insights

184
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:12,480
with open arms thank you

185
00:11:15,959 --> 00:11:19,269
so I'm a little nervous and I get
nervous say

186
00:11:19,269 --> 00:11:22,720
speak Spanglish so I apologize in
advance

187
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:26,820
it I'm gonna top a little bit about what
it

188
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:31,329
feels like I'll be a bicultural person
working in open source

189
00:11:31,329 --> 00:11:35,019
and some other things that i've seen I
mean if you know a whole bunch of

190
00:11:35,019 --> 00:11:36,910
Information Act you in private

191
00:11:36,910 --> 00:11:41,440
is just too checkers some thoughts and
comments and questions later on

192
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:46,750
an in these conversations I find really
interesting is it a lot of times

193
00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:50,329
I the conversation you have the people
that are acted very

194
00:11:50,329 --> 00:11:54,339
and there's people die you know maybe
you're awake I

195
00:11:54,339 --> 00:11:58,320
with computer to create and you think
well doesn't affect me like I i care

196
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:00,880
about this but it doesn't affect me so I
don't know how to help

197
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:04,260
one here to tell you that we actually
need your help for cultural change to

198
00:12:04,260 --> 00:12:04,910
happen

199
00:12:04,910 --> 00:12:07,980
has two be a priority for the tribe

200
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:11,740
and diversity is actually really
important like dow shared

201
00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:15,100
but also because over city makes things
more fun and makes

202
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:19,690
things were interesting we're also going
to produce better products and services

203
00:12:19,690 --> 00:12:22,829
it's really the right thing to do news
actually

204
00:12:22,829 --> 00:12:26,760
car teen where a guy

205
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:30,120
breaks into another guy's room is like
you're the reason that there's no

206
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:32,089
guarantee girls here man Lake

207
00:12:32,089 --> 00:12:37,320
stop for you know so we need your help
and it has to come from the community

208
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:38,740
and not just like

209
00:12:38,740 --> 00:12:43,570
you know the few people are affected so
when they talk about culture

210
00:12:43,570 --> 00:12:47,350
arm I really like they give people a
little bit my background is so that you

211
00:12:47,350 --> 00:12:49,570
guys understand what my preferences are

212
00:12:49,570 --> 00:12:53,300
you know what my biases may be and I'm a
native New Yorker

213
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:57,600
and I grew up in the Bronx in Yonkers
anyen native New Yorkers in here

214
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:00,899
yeah what's up I'm am a latina

215
00:13:00,899 --> 00:13:05,560
and my parents were immigrants from cuba
in Spain I also sama baptize Dominican

216
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:09,750
I grew up working in a butcher shop in
Washington Heights it in North Manhattan

217
00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:13,920
I am I love goddess stuff like I have
got a synergy everywhere

218
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:17,260
in regards to raise I come from a
multiracial family

219
00:13:17,260 --> 00:13:20,300
from a Cuban side in the merits a condo

220
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:25,290
and in terms of open source week PO is
make a week drug into open source so

221
00:13:25,290 --> 00:13:29,040
I am thats eventually hi got here

222
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:32,230
but as a bicultural person

223
00:13:32,230 --> 00:13:35,269
I think of culture very much like a

224
00:13:35,269 --> 00:13:38,269
kinda like tak great the bodies the
hardware

225
00:13:38,269 --> 00:13:41,540
and the culture is the program and

226
00:13:41,540 --> 00:13:44,860
you can have various programs I in you

227
00:13:44,860 --> 00:13:47,889
writes it could be your nationality

228
00:13:47,889 --> 00:13:51,470
it could be a raise are sexual
orientation

229
00:13:51,470 --> 00:13:55,240
and just like a program culture can be
patched

230
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:58,990
it can be updated or it can be
completely deleted rate

231
00:13:58,990 --> 00:14:03,240
and I think that that something really
really important to I keep in mind right

232
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:06,769
cultures not stagnate actually involves
and you can involve

233
00:14:06,769 --> 00:14:10,620
your own culture the good news is that

234
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:14,440
everybody in this room is a Claddagh
scope love cultures

235
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:18,670
a and floss is also Clive scope of
cultures

236
00:14:18,670 --> 00:14:22,540
the bad news is you're probably not
aware how your cultural programming fax

237
00:14:22,540 --> 00:14:23,130
you

238
00:14:23,130 --> 00:14:27,470
most people there where are aware
because they have to compete or three

239
00:14:27,470 --> 00:14:29,050
competing programs in them

240
00:14:29,050 --> 00:14:32,610
that want to compete for your brain and
they're posing rate

241
00:14:32,610 --> 00:14:37,010
so for example by cultural kid is
constantly thinking

242
00:14:37,010 --> 00:14:41,010
well this side tells me to do this this
site tells me to do this and I don't

243
00:14:41,010 --> 00:14:41,630
know

244
00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:45,440
right and the thing with open source
projects

245
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:49,149
is that a lot of times we not aware love
are quarter

246
00:14:49,149 --> 00:14:52,860
great we're not really add step taken a
step back

247
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:55,920
in looking at who's there a

248
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:59,060
where the quarter classes that are
taking place

249
00:14:59,060 --> 00:15:02,630
just feel a little bit more
conscientious about right

250
00:15:02,630 --> 00:15:05,440
and it's also really important to
understand that just because you have a

251
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:05,930
DeVry

252
00:15:05,930 --> 00:15:09,930
diversity like you have a device direct
divers RAM

253
00:15:09,930 --> 00:15:13,209
it doesn't mean that it's day versity
friendly right

254
00:15:13,209 --> 00:15:17,839
a diver silly friendly space has several
several characteristics to make a

255
00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:21,310
welcome mean and open to everyone

256
00:15:21,310 --> 00:15:24,760
user justin's facts and figures tried to
look around for stuff

257
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:29,570
I am things that I come across II by no
means am a researcher so this is just

258
00:15:29,570 --> 00:15:32,889
these are things I found that we're like
interesting I'll

259
00:15:32,889 --> 00:15:37,870
there is a 2 2012 study over 270,000
open source projects you're done sir

260
00:15:37,870 --> 00:15:38,630
switch

261
00:15:38,630 --> 00:15:41,399
and they found that the largest
contributors came from Europe in the

262
00:15:41,399 --> 00:15:42,699
United States

263
00:15:42,699 --> 00:15:46,089
I depending on the study that you read
are women make up

264
00:15:46,089 --> 00:15:49,329
anywhere from 1.5 to 3 percent the FOSS
community

265
00:15:49,329 --> 00:15:52,690
obviously some projects have a higher
percentage than others

266
00:15:52,690 --> 00:15:57,310
on a site the week pt editors just
because like we could pee is a project

267
00:15:57,310 --> 00:15:58,320
that

268
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:01,620
an you probably don't need that much tax
because you're editing

269
00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:06,399
articles right but at the same time it's
only a .5 percent said there's a really

270
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:07,959
huge gender gap

271
00:16:07,959 --> 00:16:11,240
and they did a study not too long ago
damn sure you is all right

272
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:15,600
or at least it's on the news where the
typical on study found that the typical

273
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,449
bouncers right now thirty years old

274
00:16:17,449 --> 00:16:21,160
from Europe and the United States in
terms thereof presented to people of

275
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:22,370
color in open source

276
00:16:22,370 --> 00:16:26,829
actually couldn't find any study or
research I'm a few days do you know any

277
00:16:26,829 --> 00:16:28,370
please just let me know

278
00:16:28,370 --> 00:16:32,779
I'll what I did find no is just our
studies of Technology

279
00:16:32,779 --> 00:16:37,490
in general I'll 3 percent here in the
United States 2 percent in the computing

280
00:16:37,490 --> 00:16:39,440
workforce for black women

281
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:43,209
2 percent are Latino this 5 percent are
Asian women

282
00:16:43,209 --> 00:16:46,639
I recent report from Mercury News E

283
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:49,740
said that basically the disparity in
SoCal Bali

284
00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:53,949
is getting worse for minorities I'm
which is really surprising cuz

285
00:16:53,949 --> 00:16:57,800
you would think you would actually get
better now right and and then also one

286
00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:01,009
thing I've noticed about open source
that you guys are no

287
00:17:01,009 --> 00:17:04,220
tuck obviously very English dominate I'm

288
00:17:04,220 --> 00:17:08,640
and because it that break that usually
means are you hand your also

289
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:11,500
unit act on it so that means you don't
usually have enough money to buy a piece

290
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:12,880
like a laptop right

291
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:15,990
so there's definitely a lack of
socioeconomic diversity

292
00:17:15,990 --> 00:17:20,419
on one of the things I did for this
presentation

293
00:17:20,419 --> 00:17:25,150
and was kinda I went to spanish-speaking
open source communities in a ask them

294
00:17:25,150 --> 00:17:28,150
or to some other issues that you guys
have freight

295
00:17:28,150 --> 00:17:32,830
so our these are some this is some the
feedback I got back

296
00:17:32,830 --> 00:17:36,710
everything is done in English all not
always be generally

297
00:17:36,710 --> 00:17:40,090
everything was first created in English
and then translated right

298
00:17:40,090 --> 00:17:44,200
so a lot I'm feel that they're not
actually part of the creative process

299
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:47,770
a.m. anyways there's this almost like
this thing in the back of the head that

300
00:17:47,770 --> 00:17:52,210
someone feel that they have to ask for
permission to do things are to join rate

301
00:17:52,210 --> 00:17:56,679
on it's also hard to participate if you
don't know the language well

302
00:17:56,679 --> 00:17:59,780
also in the speakers are more scene and
celebrated

303
00:17:59,780 --> 00:18:04,289
so they if you have a Spanish speaker
order any other language that

304
00:18:04,289 --> 00:18:07,679
I'll is actually really really good at
what they what they do

305
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:11,610
but they don't speak English they may
not be Lake ASEAN panels and we may be

306
00:18:11,610 --> 00:18:13,770
in your particular country but they can
learn

307
00:18:13,770 --> 00:18:17,110
you know general international tech
community lake they may not come

308
00:18:17,110 --> 00:18:20,809
to like a panel B speakers be on an
expert Liss

309
00:18:20,809 --> 00:18:24,190
I'm also summon them felt that on

310
00:18:24,190 --> 00:18:28,289
the anglo or western ways at least
consider to be the correct way

311
00:18:28,289 --> 00:18:32,080
right this in a bit inability to
understand that people do things

312
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:34,309
differently the process things
differently

313
00:18:34,309 --> 00:18:37,840
they collaborate different me and that's
something that a lot and fell

314
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:41,039
and it was like actually quite emotional
for them

315
00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:44,710
and they also feel that at times are the
our community

316
00:18:44,710 --> 00:18:47,740
donors so we appreciate your taking
advantage of the fact that there are

317
00:18:47,740 --> 00:18:51,039
different mentalities it there's
different ways to view the world that

318
00:18:51,039 --> 00:18:54,539
you know they're they're they're taking
into account different things

319
00:18:54,539 --> 00:18:57,630
so it's not just the language barrier
it's actually a culture clash

320
00:18:57,630 --> 00:19:01,110
and actually like when you go to a lot
of good the open source projects like in

321
00:19:01,110 --> 00:19:02,480
your pantry in them

322
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:06,270
you see you'll see somebody's culture
clash happen right

323
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:10,610
I am also along those lines arm
decisions are taking from the English

324
00:19:10,610 --> 00:19:11,340
Pointer view

325
00:19:11,340 --> 00:19:15,090
I'll give you a perfect example there's
one particular project that March the

326
00:19:15,090 --> 00:19:16,630
magazine right

327
00:19:16,630 --> 00:19:19,929
and now I'm there it was only in English

328
00:19:19,929 --> 00:19:24,520
finally and they finally got volunteers
in their trampoline in Spanish but

329
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:27,950
at the end of the day the editorial
decisions are made in English and maybe

330
00:19:27,950 --> 00:19:29,100
English speakers rate

331
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:32,610
so arm this is something I was commented

332
00:19:32,610 --> 00:19:36,990
also as you guys are no decisions are
made on specific time zone so

333
00:19:36,990 --> 00:19:41,010
if some you know one particular region
to sleep when they wake up they're

334
00:19:41,010 --> 00:19:42,020
likely to get

335
00:19:42,020 --> 00:19:46,020
this is not I'm not not cool with this
you know I'm

336
00:19:46,020 --> 00:19:49,600
the next 1i think affects not just
Scorchers that may be opposed to this

337
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:51,240
but also personalities rate

338
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:54,760
there's definitely a level of
aggressiveness in competitiveness in

339
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:55,570
open source

340
00:19:55,570 --> 00:19:59,660
that you see a lot mailing list rate
that it kinda pushes people away kinda

341
00:19:59,660 --> 00:20:03,309
intimidates people from wanting to
participate right

342
00:20:03,309 --> 00:20:07,059
an and that's where we say mailing lists
are bad for your health

343
00:20:07,059 --> 00:20:10,480
because Lake I can't tell you how many
times I see people like mostly

344
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:13,780
like disturbed by this on

345
00:20:13,780 --> 00:20:18,950
and then obviously you know the way that
people see open source really is

346
00:20:18,950 --> 00:20:22,030
influenced by a quarter so arm bone

347
00:20:22,030 --> 00:20:25,370
you know if you particular people are
returning to and made the distinction

348
00:20:25,370 --> 00:20:29,570
the in the US for example may have a
more libertarian amor free speech

349
00:20:29,570 --> 00:20:33,390
you know angolan in Latin America may
have a more social justice single

350
00:20:33,390 --> 00:20:37,070
so yesterday we did to meet ups

351
00:20:37,070 --> 00:20:41,429
at grady square on and if you guys are
around later please pass pain raise the

352
00:20:41,429 --> 00:20:43,049
square would love to have you there

353
00:20:43,049 --> 00:20:46,440
we did one and I and diversity and we
did a woman's group in this is some

354
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:47,830
other feedback we got there

355
00:20:47,830 --> 00:20:51,840
we did like a little workshop on and
this is so the crowd basically these are

356
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:52,970
some other comments we got

357
00:20:52,970 --> 00:20:56,070
an there's no role models

358
00:20:56,070 --> 00:21:00,070
and there's a lack investment over
cities a lake organizers think Diversey

359
00:21:00,070 --> 00:21:01,340
is an afterthought

360
00:21:01,340 --> 00:21:05,409
there's no process so that it's an
integral part of the process

361
00:21:05,409 --> 00:21:09,039
and if this is gonna be a priority we
really have to

362
00:21:09,039 --> 00:21:12,159
think be conscious a diversity from the
very beginning a

363
00:21:12,159 --> 00:21:15,490
anything that you're organizing right on

364
00:21:15,490 --> 00:21:19,409
also they feel like a lot of people may
not see the value in diversity

365
00:21:19,409 --> 00:21:23,120
like why why but why is this important

366
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:26,330
I am also even though open source is
very international

367
00:21:26,330 --> 00:21:29,679
he kinda has a monoculture right Lake

368
00:21:29,679 --> 00:21:32,929
more than likely you're here because is

369
00:21:32,929 --> 00:21:36,289
there's a common things that bring you
together and that's great

370
00:21:36,289 --> 00:21:39,360
and but at the same time it would be
cool to like you know

371
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:43,150
bring in different people have different
skills in different mindsets

372
00:21:43,150 --> 00:21:46,179
I'll back the community a

373
00:21:46,179 --> 00:21:50,510
spaces like safe spaces where people can
have these conversations

374
00:21:50,510 --> 00:21:53,600
because this is the thing about
diversity and morning to increase for

375
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:54,280
people

376
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:57,580
you actually have to have a space rate
like your new york

377
00:21:57,580 --> 00:22:01,510
it's a very international city and the
one thing that I love about native New

378
00:22:01,510 --> 00:22:03,929
Yorkers is that we talk about these
issues

379
00:22:03,929 --> 00:22:07,809
Lake directly out in the open and
sometimes those conversations can be

380
00:22:07,809 --> 00:22:09,309
like billion comfortable

381
00:22:09,309 --> 00:22:12,390
but that's how you make that's how you
change things right

382
00:22:12,390 --> 00:22:16,030
and the thing is like a lot of people
with culture talking about culture race

383
00:22:16,030 --> 00:22:18,190
like the feeling comfortable talking
about it

384
00:22:18,190 --> 00:22:22,260
but I think like everybody has to Lake
individually kinda have overcome that

385
00:22:22,260 --> 00:22:22,760
and as

386
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:27,289
organizers were doing things provide a
safe space for these conversations can

387
00:22:27,289 --> 00:22:28,370
take place

388
00:22:28,370 --> 00:22:32,929
I'm handling I wanna at I wanna leave
some

389
00:22:32,929 --> 00:22:36,270
time for questions I'm just gonna go on
to the next slide on

390
00:22:36,270 --> 00:22:39,559
this is some things like these are
possible solutions them to throw at you

391
00:22:39,559 --> 00:22:40,830
are some possible Lake

392
00:22:40,830 --> 00:22:44,130
just like some comments on like I
mentioned before

393
00:22:44,130 --> 00:22:47,510
usually only two people are factor
talking about these issues should be

394
00:22:47,510 --> 00:22:48,620
cool to have

395
00:22:48,620 --> 00:22:52,210
more people thinking about this because
again it should be like a collective

396
00:22:52,210 --> 00:22:54,190
group thing that were dressed seen

397
00:22:54,190 --> 00:22:57,720
arm keep in mind that is FedEx
preferences and dislikes

398
00:22:57,720 --> 00:23:01,990
arm I determined by background right so
that's actually why did this whole thing

399
00:23:01,990 --> 00:23:05,280
in Lake rainbows in colors to like make
a point because that's my preference

400
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:07,840
Ryan and a lot to people that like barry

401
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:12,010
so when you doing outreach material Lake
just remembered your outreach into

402
00:23:12,010 --> 00:23:13,620
different community

403
00:23:13,620 --> 00:23:18,250
it may not be you so figure out what the
like and present information

404
00:23:18,250 --> 00:23:22,600
in their preferences right so that
reduces also lay communication barriers

405
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:23,070
very

406
00:23:23,070 --> 00:23:26,429
I'm don't make assumptions ask a lot of
questions

407
00:23:26,429 --> 00:23:31,090
Lake we all give mean two things right
the way they see my phone I i scrap a

408
00:23:31,090 --> 00:23:34,630
certain into this that may be different
than the way Brian does right

409
00:23:34,630 --> 00:23:37,809
so a lotta time there's a lot of things
are on said

410
00:23:37,809 --> 00:23:41,890
so don't assume things about people ask
a lot a lot a question errors and we did

411
00:23:41,890 --> 00:23:42,400
that

412
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:46,070
will what do you mean by this lake and
and that's the problem with these things

413
00:23:46,070 --> 00:23:49,600
that cross cultural communication that
actually requires a lot of effort

414
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:53,880
to can reduce those barriers on
community management is the most in

415
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:55,400
Sentul thing

416
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:59,190
Lake definitely have people like
Empowered Committee year could be people

417
00:23:59,190 --> 00:24:00,299
that can

418
00:24:00,299 --> 00:24:04,360
arm provide the community with help like
they can Shepherd

419
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:08,140
they can make figure out like there's
bad behavior they can call it now

420
00:24:08,140 --> 00:24:11,480
or like this remind people like look
this is the guidelines

421
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:15,250
on when possible pricing chart childcare

422
00:24:15,250 --> 00:24:18,340
like that's you know we don't want to
exclude parents

423
00:24:18,340 --> 00:24:22,600
I'll and you know a lot of us have have
kids who will have kids

424
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:27,059
I'm also inviting people is enough like
don't just expect people to come here

425
00:24:27,059 --> 00:24:30,380
like go to them like go to the
communities ago where they are a

426
00:24:30,380 --> 00:24:34,200
like I A II there's a a group called mad

427
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:38,710
lacks -ism Latinos in social media and
like one of the things I do they go to

428
00:24:38,710 --> 00:24:39,510
their events

429
00:24:39,510 --> 00:24:43,299
and I try and talk to people that are
partly you know big tribal leaders or

430
00:24:43,299 --> 00:24:45,710
whatever not and talk to them about open
source

431
00:24:45,710 --> 00:24:50,919
and explain why US Latinos would want to
get involved in this right so

432
00:24:50,919 --> 00:24:54,740
even if you're not part of a community
like go to them an invite the men

433
00:24:54,740 --> 00:24:59,350
I am like I mentioned before at events
make sure to create a safe space

434
00:24:59,350 --> 00:25:03,570
I am also open a openly discuss feelers

435
00:25:03,570 --> 00:25:06,890
and this actually came from yesterday's
raid I was I think I was like one in the

436
00:25:06,890 --> 00:25:07,480
bass

437
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:10,580
points that came out in yesterday's
conversation

438
00:25:10,580 --> 00:25:14,760
like that talk about it just talk about
it honestly well did we only have wake

439
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:16,260
you know five percent women

440
00:25:16,260 --> 00:25:19,789
what happened like butts fix this you
know on

441
00:25:19,789 --> 00:25:23,669
be crew people good a cross-cultural
communications by cultural people

442
00:25:23,669 --> 00:25:24,900
bilingual people

443
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:28,440
they would be the awesome is human
bridges like I can't even tell you like

444
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:31,799
every single time they have participated
in open source project

445
00:25:31,799 --> 00:25:34,880
usually people that are bass at solving
these issues

446
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:38,440
just by defaults not even because you're
thinking about it are people that look

447
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:40,299
like I said bilingual bicultural

448
00:25:40,299 --> 00:25:45,820
on also be very sensitive like remember
that discrimination complaint dues PTSD

449
00:25:45,820 --> 00:25:49,730
by Kyle I know lotsa people that have
experience really bad things in their

450
00:25:49,730 --> 00:25:51,529
lives because of discrimination

451
00:25:51,529 --> 00:25:55,919
so people you know it's an emotional
things to be conscientious and that you

452
00:25:55,919 --> 00:25:56,580
know

453
00:25:56,580 --> 00:26:00,960
and then last thing this stuff is hard
but when you have cultural clashes and

454
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:01,820
no no

455
00:26:01,820 --> 00:26:05,880
from first-hand experience violence it's
almost like a violent thing right

456
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:06,400
because it's

457
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:11,580
internal it Lake pushes your mind your
boundaries how you see the world in its

458
00:26:11,580 --> 00:26:15,919
he can be a very violent thing right and
it's definitely a hard thing so

459
00:26:15,919 --> 00:26:19,289
you know be compassionate yourself be
compassionate with others

460
00:26:19,289 --> 00:26:22,669
and F lee have patience because if we
work at the singer other

461
00:26:22,669 --> 00:26:26,350
we can solve it like this is not hard
greatly when you go to

462
00:26:26,350 --> 00:26:30,809
private organ is it the public a your
corporate corporations they actually

463
00:26:30,809 --> 00:26:31,240
have

464
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:34,480
higher percentage divers even open sores
but that's because they're people

465
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:37,210
dedicated to the stuff right they have
HR people

466
00:26:37,210 --> 00:26:41,490
to just focus arm who sorry it's okay I
was last fight

467
00:26:41,490 --> 00:26:46,159
I'm just be patient and understand that
this is something that we can solve the

468
00:26:46,159 --> 00:26:53,159
work at it together

469
00:26:55,460 --> 00:26:58,630
thanks to both the speakers on

470
00:26:58,630 --> 00:27:03,390
in preparation for the stalker we met a
few times talking about

471
00:27:03,390 --> 00:27:07,549
the the the topic in general I think one
other things it

472
00:27:07,549 --> 00:27:10,890
that struck me was a quote that you
sandy

473
00:27:10,890 --> 00:27:14,900
told me it a.m. the maya angelou a

474
00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:19,230
can you yes %uh my Angela M prolly a
mess it up but it's when somebody tells

475
00:27:19,230 --> 00:27:20,610
you who they are

476
00:27:20,610 --> 00:27:25,110
believe them right so in the same way
when a minority tells you what they're

477
00:27:25,110 --> 00:27:26,220
experiencing

478
00:27:26,220 --> 00:27:29,630
believe them like pay attention to it
don't be like you're wrong

479
00:27:29,630 --> 00:27:34,270
Lake try and understand wider
experiencing this

480
00:27:34,270 --> 00:27:37,330
why they think it's a problem what are
the things that they're seen there is a

481
00:27:37,330 --> 00:27:38,200
problem

482
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:41,570
and and you try to help right

483
00:27:41,570 --> 00:27:44,620
yeah I think arm you know it's

484
00:27:44,620 --> 00:27:47,860
it's indicative other the the diver city

485
00:27:47,860 --> 00:27:51,220
%uh there are the range a different
styles like we had

486
00:27:51,220 --> 00:27:54,529
on the one hand we endow with his very
minimalist

487
00:27:54,529 --> 00:27:57,919
a no slides presentation

488
00:27:57,919 --> 00:28:01,350
and then we had a very colorful
presentation on the other asylum

489
00:28:01,350 --> 00:28:06,010
another thing that I thought was
interesting in our conversations was

490
00:28:06,010 --> 00:28:09,020
on this idea that up that

491
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:12,659
floss is sort of has

492
00:28:12,659 --> 00:28:16,390
as wanna thats um

493
00:28:16,390 --> 00:28:19,580
founding ideas is this idea openness
rent sell

494
00:28:19,580 --> 00:28:23,620
'em by extension you people assume that
there's

495
00:28:23,620 --> 00:28:26,720
inclusivity on value you talk to me
about

496
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:30,210
I'm having a hackerspace is

497
00:28:30,210 --> 00:28:33,899
where a.m. people come in

498
00:28:33,899 --> 00:28:37,919
and they want to participate but then
they don't really know how to get

499
00:28:37,919 --> 00:28:38,630
involved

500
00:28:38,630 --> 00:28:42,590
yeronus area an hour's going out ham

501
00:28:42,590 --> 00:28:46,080
so I fingered nurse there's quite a good
culture

502
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:50,600
and on paper inflows and also in
Merrimack spaces

503
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:53,919
fair again talking from Europe
perspective here because I don't have an

504
00:28:53,919 --> 00:28:55,809
experience here in a car spaces

505
00:28:55,809 --> 00:28:59,500
but there's there's a very general
understanding that after spaces should

506
00:28:59,500 --> 00:29:00,909
be public spaces

507
00:29:00,909 --> 00:29:04,470
bad open source of software is a

508
00:29:04,470 --> 00:29:08,399
should be able for anyone to enter in
into and participate in

509
00:29:08,399 --> 00:29:12,289
however some the ideologies behind it

510
00:29:12,289 --> 00:29:16,480
are hard to enforce sometimes in real
life when you find that you found a

511
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:17,220
space

512
00:29:17,220 --> 00:29:20,710
and you're hanging out there were two
friends and somebody might be walking in

513
00:29:20,710 --> 00:29:22,320
with a computer problem

514
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:26,399
day really might be interested in andar
learning something about Linux or

515
00:29:26,399 --> 00:29:27,809
something dirtier first time

516
00:29:27,809 --> 00:29:32,730
winter user a.m. and then the guys
hanging out there drinking club moesha

517
00:29:32,730 --> 00:29:36,899
are not necessary feeling like dirt your
helpdesk I'm

518
00:29:36,899 --> 00:29:41,840
as a servant of time very now repairing
are on our electronics are machine and

519
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:43,980
that's far more important at this moment

520
00:29:43,980 --> 00:29:47,809
I am actually there right there not a
help desk

521
00:29:47,809 --> 00:29:51,880
and you shouldn't look at his people
like your go to help desk

522
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:56,190
but thats was well one point at which
you

523
00:29:56,190 --> 00:29:59,399
basically lost a new member may be a
good members your society rich

524
00:29:59,399 --> 00:30:03,010
as a good have to do something because a
very vers first thing that happened was

525
00:30:03,010 --> 00:30:03,980
bad

526
00:30:03,980 --> 00:30:07,480
so something that happens a lot I make a
space to tend to

527
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:10,830
diverge after initial good setup

528
00:30:10,830 --> 00:30:14,940
in 20 very exclusive environments where
only do in crowds

529
00:30:14,940 --> 00:30:18,200
is welcome and yeah

530
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:21,970
after that applies to more yeah I think
it also

531
00:30:21,970 --> 00:30:25,230
speaks to this idea that a

532
00:30:25,230 --> 00:30:29,120
that monoculture is is in general bad

533
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:32,850
I mean not just from a cultural
perspective but be lookin

534
00:30:32,850 --> 00:30:38,500
biodiversity it's a server biological
imperative that the more diversity you

535
00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:38,880
have

536
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:42,020
the greater chance we have to survive I
think

537
00:30:42,020 --> 00:30:46,390
maybe what you're getting at is this
idea that you're missing out on

538
00:30:46,390 --> 00:30:48,169
opportunities when you exactly

539
00:30:48,169 --> 00:30:51,940
when you close down the the the avenues
for people to participate

540
00:30:51,940 --> 00:30:56,169
on your answer missing on may be there
you know the next Aaron Swartz could

541
00:30:56,169 --> 00:30:56,679
have been that

542
00:30:56,679 --> 00:31:00,250
here you didn't wanna no get up you know
much about it

543
00:31:00,250 --> 00:31:03,870
maybe also what i said im a tard you
it's hard to know what and uses

544
00:31:03,870 --> 00:31:07,559
really experience we've got a problem so
vote against and

545
00:31:07,559 --> 00:31:12,260
and most was a tech-savvy that relearned
are some pictures like 10 years ago

546
00:31:12,260 --> 00:31:15,990
but it can be very enlightening to see
two the struggles of people

547
00:31:15,990 --> 00:31:20,309
have sometimes in that regard and not
only talking about problems for those

548
00:31:20,309 --> 00:31:24,440
talking about solutions having a clear
structure in your space or in your

549
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:25,220
community

550
00:31:25,220 --> 00:31:29,649
helps a lot so say you have your major
space are you don't wanna be a help desk

551
00:31:29,649 --> 00:31:33,149
which 1i have like said time

552
00:31:33,149 --> 00:31:36,559
for people to answer just then decided
is gonna be like

553
00:31:36,559 --> 00:31:40,750
one hour week where you can just sit
there and people know today can come

554
00:31:40,750 --> 00:31:41,730
there and the No

555
00:31:41,730 --> 00:31:45,279
kinda what to expect because to culture
openers

556
00:31:45,279 --> 00:31:48,620
and sharing and everybody equal also
implies a lot on

557
00:31:48,620 --> 00:31:51,820
non-structural isthmus and it makes the
opaque for

558
00:31:51,820 --> 00:31:55,120
people to enter into the community like
what to expect and

559
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:58,399
what's gonna what time in who can I
accident on the shoulder if I have a

560
00:31:58,399 --> 00:31:59,250
problem because

561
00:31:59,250 --> 00:32:03,289
girl just Salvadorian sitting at a
computer

562
00:32:03,289 --> 00:32:07,130
and Sandy you talked a little bit about
other difference between

563
00:32:07,130 --> 00:32:13,049
European and Latin American culture in
terms of the a

564
00:32:13,049 --> 00:32:16,510
participation a.m.

565
00:32:16,510 --> 00:32:19,890
it off a little bit more about you know
what

566
00:32:19,890 --> 00:32:26,750
what efforts are being done this are if
any to try and sort it brings decides

567
00:32:26,750 --> 00:32:31,450
make them a little bit more
collaborative well I mean I think

568
00:32:31,450 --> 00:32:35,140
I'm sorry for me on when are the things
like

569
00:32:35,140 --> 00:32:40,190
and my organization that we're doing is
were organizing the festival and I'm

570
00:32:40,190 --> 00:32:41,100
trying to do

571
00:32:41,100 --> 00:32:44,600
are more word we're as it could be
trying to do in Spain just to have it at

572
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:46,440
a spanish-speaking country

573
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:49,580
and I think that that's actually part

574
00:32:49,580 --> 00:32:54,750
the problem right leg I think part of
the problem is I we need to find

575
00:32:54,750 --> 00:32:58,590
the community in go to them

576
00:32:58,590 --> 00:33:02,610
and I'm like I know like I'm really
active I was really active in June I'm

577
00:33:02,610 --> 00:33:05,730
not as active as I used to be before but

578
00:33:05,730 --> 00:33:08,970
when the things that I saw that was
really value essential

579
00:33:08,970 --> 00:33:12,740
and imported was when I first got there

580
00:33:12,740 --> 00:33:15,750
there is like very few Lake group Lake I

581
00:33:15,750 --> 00:33:19,690
you know kinda virtual spaces for it
dispatch been community

582
00:33:19,690 --> 00:33:23,360
and little by little the streets to
create these a huge virtual spaces in

583
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:24,370
Spanish

584
00:33:24,370 --> 00:33:27,820
and that was really really powerful
because at the end of the day

585
00:33:27,820 --> 00:33:31,120
that particular subcommittee could
empower themselves

586
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:34,490
could ask questions could rely on each
other so

587
00:33:34,490 --> 00:33:38,370
good and I Annabeth weird refrains in

588
00:33:38,370 --> 00:33:41,950
but I think that's really important
helping the subcultures late

589
00:33:41,950 --> 00:33:45,390
kinda come together in Para themselves

590
00:33:45,390 --> 00:33:48,390
so in the interests other cultural
diversity

591
00:33:48,390 --> 00:33:51,519
we want to open it up to questions
comments and

592
00:33:51,519 --> 00:33:56,179
complaints there's a microphone in the
middle of the room

593
00:33:56,179 --> 00:34:00,620
so yes anything struck a chart for
Eureka additions to make feel free to

594
00:34:00,620 --> 00:34:04,899
bring it on I think summer she already
is

595
00:34:04,899 --> 00:34:08,379
now welcome

596
00:34:08,379 --> 00:34:12,920
by arm so I guess a quick comment and a
question

597
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:17,410
I like the and therefore love biology
and evolution

598
00:34:17,410 --> 00:34:21,160
comes up a lot in the sorts discussions
making people don't take a quite far

599
00:34:21,160 --> 00:34:23,020
enough because you see even

600
00:34:23,020 --> 00:34:26,030
so sex is a great way to

601
00:34:26,030 --> 00:34:29,170
increase diversity in even asexual
bacteria

602
00:34:29,170 --> 00:34:32,150
come up with a way the passenger trains
between them because it is the most

603
00:34:32,150 --> 00:34:33,120
effective

604
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:36,330
way to spread ideas to sprint data I

605
00:34:36,330 --> 00:34:41,490
and so this sort of diversity i think is
young people and take them out for quite

606
00:34:41,490 --> 00:34:42,440
far nothing
