on and here you can see the tiny URL
down at the bottom

16
00:00:51,670 --> 00:00:56,690
oose dash 2014 %uh this is the book I'm
sorry it's the only book that I sold my

17
00:00:56,690 --> 00:00:57,660
soul for

18
00:00:57,660 --> 00:01:02,440
to put it in the book store so I don't
own it it is available on piratebay but

19
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:04,939
when I went to get it I got all kinds a
virus shit

20
00:01:04,939 --> 00:01:11,790
are and sell if someone can give me a
clean copy of my own book

21
00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:14,860
all posted at my website for people to

22
00:01:14,860 --> 00:01:18,200
to download because all my other books
are free online

23
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:23,549
on never been about money so I went
through key negative trends key positive

24
00:01:23,549 --> 00:01:24,320
trends

25
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:27,830
on revolution simplified on

26
00:01:27,830 --> 00:01:32,470
this is the revolution I in 1976 I did
my first graduate thesis I'm predicting

27
00:01:32,470 --> 00:01:33,229
revolution

28
00:01:33,229 --> 00:01:36,479
and it's still looking very very good

29
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:40,340
and here in red are all the
preconditions revolution that exist in

30
00:01:40,340 --> 00:01:41,740
the United States today

31
00:01:41,740 --> 00:01:46,270
on as well as the United Kingdom and
what we're missing is a process a tent

32
00:01:46,270 --> 00:01:49,899
and I will tell you right now I think
that precipitated this going to be a

33
00:01:49,899 --> 00:01:52,770
pedophilia scandal that will knock your
socks off

34
00:01:52,770 --> 00:01:57,750
because we have tens of thousands have
sex slaves between Boston New York and

35
00:01:57,750 --> 00:01:59,030
Washington DC

36
00:01:59,030 --> 00:02:02,850
and these kids are killed when they run
out at the useful life

37
00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:07,270
on that is something that is gonna so
shocked people

38
00:02:07,270 --> 00:02:10,770
that I think it will break the back of
the dynamic

39
00:02:10,770 --> 00:02:13,989
in which people are very tolerant to the
elites getting away with

40
00:02:13,989 --> 00:02:17,540
quite literally the abuse and murder on

41
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:21,430
few complicated sides this is the open
source everything side

42
00:02:21,430 --> 00:02:26,050
this came to me directly from God after
we finished talking to george bush

43
00:02:26,050 --> 00:02:30,959
on up and i like it an open BTS is there

44
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:34,440
he you know I've been familiar with open
BTS for a long time

45
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:38,000
I'm a fan of David Weinberger an open
spectrum

46
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,260
and the bottom line is we need all the
opens together

47
00:02:41,260 --> 00:02:47,370
as an ecology on week we we cannot do
one open alone I mean when he SRI talks

48
00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:48,989
about open data they're saying

49
00:02:48,989 --> 00:02:52,650
give us all your data we wanna fuck you
with our proprietary software

50
00:02:52,650 --> 00:02:56,930
okay so you have to have open source
software open source hardware

51
00:02:56,930 --> 00:03:00,409
open spectrum open cloud the whole day
on

52
00:03:00,409 --> 00:03:05,170
and this is the design that weed and
this is Mike geek side

53
00:03:05,170 --> 00:03:08,970
you can go get it this is actually
Robert curry gonna pay

54
00:03:08,970 --> 00:03:12,190
I wanna honor Robert career he died in a
hotel room alone

55
00:03:12,190 --> 00:03:16,720
on and about the age 51 he was extremely
fit person

56
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:20,069
I still don't know why he died but he
died way too young

57
00:03:20,069 --> 00:03:24,629
he was one of the very first people to
really understand that security is about

58
00:03:24,629 --> 00:03:26,480
trust it's not about control

59
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:32,000
and I tried sharing this slide with the
guy that replace Keith Alexander

60
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,330
he just doesn't get it the red side is
the

61
00:03:35,330 --> 00:03:39,610
top-down hierarchical control asshole
approach to security

62
00:03:39,610 --> 00:03:43,269
on the green side is what we should be
doing

63
00:03:43,269 --> 00:03:46,950
and I credit all these ideas to Robert
Corry

64
00:03:46,950 --> 00:03:50,620
I'll I stand on the shoulders of others

65
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:55,750
are some love you know I read a lot on
ninety eight categories listed if I beta

66
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:57,250
iota under the book page

67
00:03:57,250 --> 00:04:01,750
on and these are some of the list that I
put together and two books in particular

68
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:04,230
that I really impressed me this past few
years

69
00:04:04,230 --> 00:04:09,810
are governing the commons: which the
lady got a Nobel Prize for demonstrating

70
00:04:09,810 --> 00:04:14,120
that essentially hybrid governance and
and governance in which the people

71
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:16,190
themselves who developing the rules

72
00:04:16,190 --> 00:04:20,509
and also doing the monitoring and the
policing like in fisheries

73
00:04:20,509 --> 00:04:24,669
if everyone who's doing the fishing is
part of the rulemaking and part of the

74
00:04:24,669 --> 00:04:25,620
enforcement

75
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:30,270
it works on the other hand if you have
hired thugs from Blackwater it doesn't

76
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:31,060
work

77
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:34,810
okay on and then stop thief

78
00:04:34,810 --> 00:04:39,350
I really really believes that the
Commons is is a concept that has to come

79
00:04:39,350 --> 00:04:43,500
cyberspace on and I've heard a lot of
that this time around

80
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:46,610
are open spectrum is in fact

81
00:04:46,610 --> 00:04:51,259
the the territorial integrity of the
people it cannot and should not be

82
00:04:51,259 --> 00:04:56,530
own this is my favorite slide it took me
25 years to get to this side

83
00:04:56,530 --> 00:04:59,810
and you can go get the briefs to to
figure it out later

84
00:04:59,810 --> 00:05:03,340
on this is what I wanna build if anyone
has a hundred million dollars

85
00:05:03,340 --> 00:05:06,639
arm I'll give you my email

86
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:11,270
on but essentially

87
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:14,639
we're fucked on

88
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:20,580
I mean it's not just the US government
that's host its new york university

89
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:24,729
and Columbia University and Harvard in
all these people

90
00:05:24,729 --> 00:05:29,160
they're all stovepipe they're all
talking out there ass

91
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:33,900
and I none of them are really sharing
information are making sense if you I do

92
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:36,930
say how many people know about citation
analysis

93
00:05:36,930 --> 00:05:41,520
citation analytics alright well as a
freshman in college I knew more about

94
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:44,720
citation analytics and the vice chairman
of the National Intelligence Council

95
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:46,430
twenty years later

96
00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:49,740
this is not something academics do and
they should

97
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:53,740
citation analytics means you use the
Social Science Citation Index to the

98
00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:57,789
Science Citation Index to find out who
the fuck is writing serious stuff

99
00:05:57,789 --> 00:06:02,300
and that's based on citations and see
you create a list of the top 100 people

100
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:04,050
in your fielder domain

101
00:06:04,050 --> 00:06:07,270
and then you start following that out to
the other disciplines

102
00:06:07,270 --> 00:06:11,009
and a new interview those people to get
to who are the top people that are not

103
00:06:11,009 --> 00:06:12,810
publishing

104
00:06:12,810 --> 00:06:16,690
and that's how you actually get truly
grasp with ground truth

105
00:06:16,690 --> 00:06:20,500
well our intelligence community doesn't
do that

106
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:23,889
they talk to whatever 14 assholes have
clearances

107
00:06:23,889 --> 00:06:27,380
are and are being made available by SAIC

108
00:06:27,380 --> 00:06:30,970
are I which is a prescription for

109
00:06:30,970 --> 00:06:36,910
instance stupidity arm so what I wanna
build is a school future-oriented hybrid

110
00:06:36,910 --> 00:06:37,680
governance their

111
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:42,370
a tribes %uh aid information networks
academic civil society

112
00:06:42,370 --> 00:06:46,490
government commerce government of law
enforcement

113
00:06:46,490 --> 00:06:50,770
media military non-government non-profit
and I want to build the world Brain

114
00:06:50,770 --> 00:06:54,750
Institute in these are the four things I
own three of these four URL so I don't

115
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:55,080
have

116
00:06:55,080 --> 00:07:00,690
dot EDU yet and I want to build a global
serious game a darker Bell who was the

117
00:07:00,690 --> 00:07:06,050
Cole creator with buckminster fuller of
the analog world game I paid for him to

118
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:09,099
build the architecture back when I was a
minor millionaire

119
00:07:09,099 --> 00:07:13,979
I paid for him arm which I'm not anymore
I'm selling these pens for ten dollars

120
00:07:13,979 --> 00:07:15,039
each

121
00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:19,169
if anyone wants to support me getting
back home on

122
00:07:19,169 --> 00:07:23,630
but II paid for him to design the
architecture in for under $5 million

123
00:07:23,630 --> 00:07:26,270
dollars a year we can create the world
brain

124
00:07:26,270 --> 00:07:31,330
on I mean the global the global game the
the peace that actually has true cost

125
00:07:31,330 --> 00:07:32,389
economics

126
00:07:32,389 --> 00:07:36,590
and all of the actual feedback loops in
relationships between things like the

127
00:07:36,590 --> 00:07:38,440
water

128
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:42,780
we all know Keith Alexander is a is an
evil person

129
00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:46,000
but is also much stupider then you might

130
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:51,910
realize are the NSA center in Utah which
is a water Star State

131
00:07:51,910 --> 00:07:57,050
requires 1.7 million gallons of clean
water every single fucking day

132
00:07:57,050 --> 00:08:00,530
are too cool okay what can a moron

133
00:08:00,530 --> 00:08:05,090
puts a supercomputer center and a water
Star State

134
00:08:05,090 --> 00:08:10,080
okay on so these are the kinds of things
it should cost economics helps you think

135
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:10,990
about

136
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:14,770
you have to actually take it into into
serious consideration

137
00:08:14,770 --> 00:08:19,259
that's a real estate I want the United
Nations has lots of problems but this is

138
00:08:19,259 --> 00:08:20,560
the big picture

139
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:27,419
and that's the end to the slideshow so
who has a question

140
00:08:27,419 --> 00:08:31,009
yes sir 0 gotta

141
00:08:31,009 --> 00:08:36,760
10 we have a genius in the crowd yeah

142
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:40,310
thank you I'm honored by your interest
on you say something about

143
00:08:40,310 --> 00:08:44,450
open lose versus corporate-owned news
agencies

144
00:08:44,450 --> 00:08:47,970
wiser feedback on that thing say
something about open news

145
00:08:47,970 --> 00:08:51,690
as opposed to corporate Robert Murdock a
rupert murdoch

146
00:08:51,690 --> 00:08:54,740
okay on

147
00:08:54,740 --> 00:08:59,860
one other really think that way I got
into open source intelligence when I

148
00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:02,620
created the Marine Corps intelligence
command

149
00:09:02,620 --> 00:09:06,330
I was a senior civilian and I spent
twenty million dollars on access to

150
00:09:06,330 --> 00:09:09,870
top-secret everything and then I had
this was nineteen eighty-eight now so I

151
00:09:09,870 --> 00:09:12,279
had one little PC with with access to

152
00:09:12,279 --> 00:09:15,589
the source okay back in 88

153
00:09:15,589 --> 00:09:20,110
and inside a week my Alice started
lining up for that I said what on earth

154
00:09:20,110 --> 00:09:23,610
are you doing in the said there's
nothing in the secret database

155
00:09:23,610 --> 00:09:27,589
about high 80 per run D somalia whatever

156
00:09:27,589 --> 00:09:31,070
K so what are the problems we have with
the secret system

157
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:36,350
is it is very narrowly focused and it's
based on secret sources and methods that

158
00:09:36,350 --> 00:09:37,480
are like a Cadillac

159
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:41,700
running on a superhighway between Moscow
and Washington DC

160
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:46,010
it's not adaptable so you can do

161
00:09:46,010 --> 00:09:49,890
you can turn a Cadillac on a
superhighway into 10 jeeps

162
00:09:49,890 --> 00:09:54,700
a hundred motorcycles a thousand
bicycles and fifteen million pedestrians

163
00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:57,790
which is what you actually need to do
open source now

164
00:09:57,790 --> 00:10:01,420
the difference between news and
intelligence or information data

165
00:10:01,420 --> 00:10:03,930
information and intelligence is very
important

166
00:10:03,930 --> 00:10:09,170
I mean date is the raw data information
is that stuff which is broadcast and and

167
00:10:09,170 --> 00:10:12,440
information is like an artwork it has a
Providence

168
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:15,790
I mean if it's from the New York Times
The Wall Street Journal its 50 percent

169
00:10:15,790 --> 00:10:16,959
share

170
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:21,190
okay I mean these people still think
that Abdul in Afghanistan is half

171
00:10:21,190 --> 00:10:22,500
Pashtun

172
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:25,560
and the new york times lawyers are so
fucking stupid

173
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:29,670
that they would actually go do the
research in Afghanistan where I was

174
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:33,200
where I read his days bio translated in
Dari

175
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:39,260
he is 100 percent I G it is not possible
for him to win a national election

176
00:10:39,260 --> 00:10:42,890
what we have just seen in Afghanistan is
a major covert action

177
00:10:42,890 --> 00:10:47,000
trying to throw Gunny under the bus in
order to cut a deal with Iran on a

178
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:47,829
nuclear

179
00:10:47,829 --> 00:10:51,300
arrangement which Iran has now written
off okay

180
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:56,120
Gandhi won the election 60/40 but there
has been a major covert action in which

181
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:59,290
the US and Iran had a coincidence of
interest

182
00:10:59,290 --> 00:11:02,680
in having up to love fraudulently win
that election

183
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:08,670
so intelligence is when you move past
news and you get to answers to a

184
00:11:08,670 --> 00:11:10,910
specific question

185
00:11:10,910 --> 00:11:14,230
such as who actually won this election

186
00:11:14,230 --> 00:11:17,740
now to get to that we had to do polling

187
00:11:17,740 --> 00:11:21,380
the state department canceled all of its
polls

188
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:25,600
in Afghanistan because they knew that
the polls which show that abdulah was

189
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:27,640
being elected fraudulently

190
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:32,519
and so someone else came in and ran
polls and we pop that bubble

191
00:11:32,519 --> 00:11:35,760
I'm very proud of having been part of
popping the bubble

192
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:39,420
on on trying to fraudulently elect
Abdullah because that would have led to

193
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:42,480
rein in control of their wealth in the
north and the West

194
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:46,730
and it would have fled to Pakistan
oversight over divided Pashtun tribes

195
00:11:46,730 --> 00:11:50,310
which is all about protecting the Durand
Line which is a British

196
00:11:50,310 --> 00:11:53,870
imposition dividing tribes is not a good
idea

197
00:11:53,870 --> 00:11:57,240
okay it causes issues naw

198
00:11:57,240 --> 00:12:01,639
sold data information and then
intelligence now

199
00:12:01,639 --> 00:12:05,130
anybody can do intelligence my second
book in their copies in

200
00:12:05,130 --> 00:12:08,329
in those boxes back there by the way my
intent

201
00:12:08,329 --> 00:12:12,570
is did anyone who wants a book take it
in fact take five or six and if you can

202
00:12:12,570 --> 00:12:13,910
sell 'em that's great

203
00:12:13,910 --> 00:12:17,470
and if you wanna send me fifty percent
as a contribution earth intelligence

204
00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:18,839
network thank you

205
00:12:18,839 --> 00:12:23,779
are but there's no obligation alright so
my hope is the books will vanish

206
00:12:23,779 --> 00:12:27,930
and at least have you will be guilted
into contributing five to ten dollars

207
00:12:27,930 --> 00:12:31,430
okay this is my gift guilty economy

208
00:12:31,430 --> 00:12:34,760
model alright arm

209
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:39,290
he you well I don't know you know i mean
a a tight I come here I get more value

210
00:12:39,290 --> 00:12:42,100
from you guys and I give I mean I love
coming here

211
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:46,500
this is for me is a refreshing break
from from lying assholes

212
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:51,250
on and I really truly thrive in this
environment

213
00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:55,149
on but coming back to intelligence

214
00:12:55,149 --> 00:12:56,250
intelligence were
