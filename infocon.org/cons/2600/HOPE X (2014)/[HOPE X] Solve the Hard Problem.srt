1
00:00:00,359 --> 00:00:03,280
I hope you don't mind me I'm in a prior
end up sitting down for us this unduly

2
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:05,990
the house lights on this will be a very
interactive presentation

3
00:00:05,990 --> 00:00:09,969
and so I if you're not comfortable baby
come up

4
00:00:09,969 --> 00:00:13,559
election my children in front the should
be good so high and %uh Sanders

5
00:00:13,559 --> 00:00:18,939
arm and I'm for running on other many
cylinders today so bear with me

6
00:00:18,939 --> 00:00:23,050
um bring

7
00:00:23,050 --> 00:00:26,119
began happen good

8
00:00:26,119 --> 00:00:29,840
I promise not drop any Mikes it'll look
like much drops in my smile I can drop

9
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:30,539
the next so

10
00:00:30,539 --> 00:00:33,840
a person you know that I'm not speaking
on behalf of my job these are all my

11
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:34,780
personal opinions

12
00:00:34,780 --> 00:00:41,170
then so is deemed to geeks today when
you make the argument to you that your

13
00:00:41,170 --> 00:00:41,820
belief

14
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:46,960
in science is wrong and what's more it
may be responsible for why

15
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:50,059
Johnny can't encrypt right

16
00:00:50,059 --> 00:00:53,750
I'm illustrate my point using this

17
00:00:53,750 --> 00:01:00,550
anybody know this CBS Sony was this SK
CD is our beloved keep comic this is a

18
00:01:00,550 --> 00:01:03,800
rental monroe's some feel drained by
purity

19
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:08,810
news maelstrom I was using it also was
my point I would my ex-boyfriend you too

20
00:01:08,810 --> 00:01:11,220
hopes ago left me to go into the Peace
Corps

21
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:14,570
right as you see him here I

22
00:01:14,570 --> 00:01:19,159
he went boo cool I and maybe I'm biased
in the audience already

23
00:01:19,159 --> 00:01:22,229
on who's been that's not his actual face

24
00:01:22,229 --> 00:01:26,220
on he he went to an African country are
referred to as

25
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:30,250
hell I'm sorry home I'm so sorry time
machine fuck you

26
00:01:30,250 --> 00:01:35,950
on part mean I know I'm sorry no it is
is this though there's any kids in a

27
00:01:35,950 --> 00:01:37,150
room you may wanna careers

28
00:01:37,150 --> 00:01:40,180
um right so I love a

29
00:01:40,180 --> 00:01:44,619
come sign is my eek the column he comes
I'll cop size as a matter a family pride

30
00:01:44,619 --> 00:01:46,310
for him he was computer scientist

31
00:01:46,310 --> 00:01:49,930
his father is a computer scientists
around and you say well cops I

32
00:01:49,930 --> 00:01:53,149
you know the reverse themselves can sign
I'm

33
00:01:53,149 --> 00:01:56,500
succumbs I went to an African country
that are referred to as fulani

34
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:59,939
to scare where it was because the way to
find his blog don't do that on

35
00:01:59,939 --> 00:02:03,300
he's not in the room using your

36
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:05,690
I really hope is not in the room anyway
even if you're here you might wanna

37
00:02:05,690 --> 00:02:07,190
leave I'm

38
00:02:07,190 --> 00:02:10,270
Todd if you're here does my boss in the
room lemon tournament sorry

39
00:02:10,270 --> 00:02:14,720
on anyways accompli was basically is way
up I've identifies as well identifying

40
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:17,200
is way of doing things was a comp sci
we're doing

41
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:21,170
cell and if you don't mind coming so
much he called himself Comp Sci where he

42
00:02:21,170 --> 00:02:22,020
belongs on here

43
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:25,130
mask for Hans return calls call outs
already belong on

44
00:02:25,130 --> 00:02:31,380
on this chart he's kansai there will not
be a quiz yes

45
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:37,580
in looking ahead to businesses actually
that is exactly where I have in place

46
00:02:37,580 --> 00:02:37,880
right

47
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:42,090
so so is its me he's its mathy stuff
right it's getting close to pure but

48
00:02:42,090 --> 00:02:42,650
some

49
00:02:42,650 --> 00:02:45,800
it's it's also applied right so that's
not very pure it's been supplied

50
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:52,000
right okay I forgot to turn off my phone
all that's awesome

51
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,330
that was actually my boss 2 years 3

52
00:02:56,330 --> 00:03:00,050
greatest talk ever great time were
greeted

53
00:03:00,050 --> 00:03:03,790
served and right so yes we got we got
that

54
00:03:03,790 --> 00:03:06,319
we got him settled on this chart is
there anything over to the right to

55
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:06,880
discharge

56
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:11,950
further past mathematicians what floss
for some people might say

57
00:03:11,950 --> 00:03:15,480
lovers I don't think randall Munroe
grease you haven't her left what is over

58
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:16,510
the left on this chart

59
00:03:16,510 --> 00:03:22,340
on plus we also heard philosophers I'm

60
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:26,849
who else what else artists

61
00:03:26,849 --> 00:03:30,610
who knows where the hell they really do
this some more often lead to tip the

62
00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:31,780
chart in there always another

63
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:35,400
down the end this from his other strip
on which is every majors terrible was

64
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:37,060
absolutely my favorite some strips

65
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:40,920
I'm saying every major acne is terrible
so your poetry is over there

66
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:44,459
why anyone who wants a job would study
little mystery in with their only choice

67
00:03:44,459 --> 00:03:46,090
for something like art history

68
00:03:46,090 --> 00:03:49,150
an answer yet he think that philosophy
is just massive trigger something

69
00:03:49,150 --> 00:03:50,250
practicality right so

70
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:53,580
anywhere you go further up to mister you
get maybe anthropology right

71
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:56,700
I'm philosophy maybe depending on how
you think things history literature

72
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:57,540
poetry

73
00:03:57,540 --> 00:04:02,019
on who here has showing him to hear a
sense that this is

74
00:04:02,019 --> 00:04:05,359
a hierarchy in the world the what's
important to study who's had that sense

75
00:04:05,359 --> 00:04:06,079
at some point

76
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:10,430
be honest they really outrageous
something they're all pretty firmly

77
00:04:10,430 --> 00:04:11,440
within a lingering

78
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:16,340
where did you get that sense this is not
a rhetorical question anybody home unit

79
00:04:16,340 --> 00:04:17,590
where did you get that sense

80
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:22,539
high school okay what salaries

81
00:04:22,539 --> 00:04:26,729
hi yes yes your boss likes you better if
you do some math

82
00:04:26,729 --> 00:04:31,340
especially applied math grade so what
else magazines okay media generally

83
00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:34,330
register maybe there's some media
reasons why right soap

84
00:04:34,330 --> 00:04:38,840
said I didn't he is now we know what
roles are sitting alright

85
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:42,060
on okay so %um securities were given on

86
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:44,680
way to put this right purity and as
we've heard other things we've heard

87
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:47,039
like social hierarchies in schools we've
heard

88
00:04:47,039 --> 00:04:50,090
what you get paid right so those are
other is doing is pure is a bit of an

89
00:04:50,090 --> 00:04:50,650
odd one

90
00:04:50,650 --> 00:04:54,360
minutes juries may be intellectually and
assorted viewing this particular chart

91
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:58,990
um if you want to see purity how else
would you describe his way over on the

92
00:04:58,990 --> 00:05:01,180
right hand side versus whose all there
on the left

93
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:04,280
what words to use them

94
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:07,640
attendant who else abstraction okay

95
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:10,789
at Aspergers hasn't appropriated

96
00:05:10,789 --> 00:05:14,010
so going to I tell you gonna be fair
though

97
00:05:14,010 --> 00:05:17,740
I'm before going into abstraction like
what would people are more abstract

98
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:20,120
thinking they're able to handle more
obstruction what would you say about

99
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:23,260
them in general

100
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:28,030
what else might bring my friends were
talking about brains on when we were

101
00:05:28,030 --> 00:05:29,930
talking about smart she would seem to be
smart

102
00:05:29,930 --> 00:05:33,150
smarter people over the right I it's
okay

103
00:05:33,150 --> 00:05:37,099
now no no susan has not and I'm seeing
some heads shaking now so that's good to

104
00:05:37,099 --> 00:05:37,380
know

105
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:41,760
can on I hope no one is useful

106
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:45,370
was practically implied missiles in any
order rates more useful maybe

107
00:05:45,370 --> 00:05:50,080
maybe I dunno Matthew knows right how do
we know

108
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:57,080
once again how do we know what the
values are unusual these parts

109
00:05:59,430 --> 00:06:02,460
begin to unions we want him to be going
back to school may be going back to

110
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:03,789
social structures things like that

111
00:06:03,789 --> 00:06:08,530
so I am medium school

112
00:06:08,530 --> 00:06:13,349
should be used for rent okay so moving
on with this talk is going to be about

113
00:06:13,349 --> 00:06:15,419
why it's a huge problem too

114
00:06:15,419 --> 00:06:18,590
value math science and technical kinds
of knowledge at the expense

115
00:06:18,590 --> 00:06:21,990
other kinds knowledge whites a problem
to treat those problems

116
00:06:21,990 --> 00:06:26,139
as the most challenging interesting and
important problems right now our physics

117
00:06:26,139 --> 00:06:30,099
and math and science the most important
problems the most challenging problems

118
00:06:30,099 --> 00:06:33,349
glad people here would and challenging
um

119
00:06:33,349 --> 00:06:37,300
un problema sizing is because it doesn't
always go well when you give free rein

120
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:38,270
to someone who's

121
00:06:38,270 --> 00:06:41,729
only credentials were there a tech
engineers 17 and some sort of genius

122
00:06:41,729 --> 00:06:42,800
physics major

123
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:46,360
for example second line for a word
greatly

124
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:49,639
and I don't know if you're familiar look
Philip Rosedale was arm

125
00:06:49,639 --> 00:06:52,729
physics physics major and I'm also in

126
00:06:52,729 --> 00:06:58,509
a a on at seventeen a tech entrepreneur
so he says he has the virtual world

127
00:06:58,509 --> 00:07:02,129
things are easier and people were more
honest as a spoken by somebody was not

128
00:07:02,129 --> 00:07:04,240
at all inquisitive about what people are
actually doing

129
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:08,479
right so King Philip hired him to sort
of like vaunted

130
00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:11,800
much-talked-about a media wave running
this company that was like yeah it can

131
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:13,129
be like a free market in like

132
00:07:13,129 --> 00:07:16,360
within the company whoever does the
coolest smartest thing that's most

133
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:19,409
valuable will be rewarded by other
people company is very

134
00:07:19,409 --> 00:07:23,919
structure was flat hierarchy and and so
we hired a whole company for love math

135
00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:26,979
science and common geniuses and
basically let them do what they wanted

136
00:07:26,979 --> 00:07:31,250
the result would send the most patient
gamer crying to his parents living room

137
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:33,110
to watch Everybody Loves Raymond

138
00:07:33,110 --> 00:07:36,650
right like forget the heart problems if
you like I'm done with this I'm just

139
00:07:36,650 --> 00:07:37,939
done with the heart problems

140
00:07:37,939 --> 00:07:42,270
like right so Emily also end up with
high-end graphics that work awesome in

141
00:07:42,270 --> 00:07:46,009
to use them on like a netbook which
people regularly did regularly

142
00:07:46,009 --> 00:07:49,539
yeah our immigration any graphics and
then they rendered absolutely poorly on

143
00:07:49,539 --> 00:07:51,289
what was not topical and software right

144
00:07:51,289 --> 00:07:54,339
I mean there's needy people in this
frame to do even notice that there were

145
00:07:54,339 --> 00:07:57,159
naked people has been you have to wait
five minutes to find out that there

146
00:07:57,159 --> 00:07:57,560
there

147
00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:01,990
right second line great success okay
stop him he's he's

148
00:08:01,990 --> 00:08:06,479
he's about to start another a another
virtual world started shortly

149
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:11,120
so stop before it kills me in any way I
work in Second Life I have some biases I

150
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:14,180
were just like it was actually a really
great place or lotta fun

151
00:08:14,180 --> 00:08:18,069
there are some serious problems in you
know what was being prioritized but

152
00:08:18,069 --> 00:08:21,810
or the main contenders is why everybody
find all over for what they're like oh

153
00:08:21,810 --> 00:08:25,120
yeah I such a great market leader is a
tech whiz kid he studied physics

154
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:28,969
I think mostly wondering cuz he was like
Mark Hamill only with hypnotic

155
00:08:28,969 --> 00:08:32,630
eyes would roll thru yield while he was
talking right so

156
00:08:32,630 --> 00:08:36,789
anyway I'm this kind of bonding over
geniuses for their brilliant Tech

157
00:08:36,789 --> 00:08:40,190
Solutions is a constant these days right
degree Palace you gots on nichols'

158
00:08:40,190 --> 00:08:40,949
nigger party

159
00:08:40,949 --> 00:08:45,079
never party ran multiple field laptop
programs before

160
00:08:45,079 --> 00:08:48,730
OLPC 11 Laptop Per Child problem program
and yet we still like

161
00:08:48,730 --> 00:08:51,880
are you how's that time does that things
should give more laptops

162
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:55,500
and send him to fulani apparently why
does everybody

163
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:59,130
at maker but do would be PETA says no

164
00:08:59,130 --> 00:09:02,430
he's a action is a movie coming out
about San and we're going to spin it

165
00:09:02,430 --> 00:09:03,329
within and again

166
00:09:03,329 --> 00:09:06,560
to screen is worth checking out the
maker by movies it'll be

167
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:10,899
give you a background in to what's going
on it's brilliant eh company so

168
00:09:10,899 --> 00:09:14,019
what math and science don't make you
smart because they're

169
00:09:14,019 --> 00:09:16,240
better than other fields in some way
that there are more rigorous more

170
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:18,250
abstract one for viewing it backward

171
00:09:18,250 --> 00:09:21,800
and math and science are valued most
highly because they produce what capital

172
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:23,160
wants most

173
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:27,959
right standardization automated
production

174
00:09:27,959 --> 00:09:33,910
any constant stream of new products yes
and make backups I cups I and World

175
00:09:33,910 --> 00:09:34,810
Peace Corps

176
00:09:34,810 --> 00:09:37,640
good I wanted to support as much as I
could you know I just finished my degree

177
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:41,390
in anthropology education and technology
and I thought I could maybe help him

178
00:09:41,390 --> 00:09:45,000
he's going to a country needs to
understand the people there but his

179
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,089
students said things and did things that
he didn't understand like

180
00:09:48,089 --> 00:09:51,649
most you're my computer doesn't have
open all programs rain

181
00:09:51,649 --> 00:09:55,569
depends on when he wrote a blog post
about this he said that they're just not

182
00:09:55,569 --> 00:09:59,430
able to reason through basic things like
finding more all programs are

183
00:09:59,430 --> 00:10:03,690
they don't look in any of the right
places on the screen and

184
00:10:03,690 --> 00:10:07,149
I said okay we'll and you what was going
on so i cud

185
00:10:07,149 --> 00:10:10,930
slab or I've got Windows XP machines and
we went to machines an extra twenty

186
00:10:10,930 --> 00:10:14,160
machines I said are you switching them
around from computer to computer

187
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:18,300
to yell for someone like to possess
times and Mike doesn't which is like

188
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:21,309
there's your problem like I was looking
under the hood as karna didn't go over

189
00:10:21,309 --> 00:10:24,250
particularly well because he was smart
and he did not want to be on smart

190
00:10:24,250 --> 00:10:24,760
suddenly

191
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:30,029
cell on so you know what he was your
hypothesis about why his computer was

192
00:10:30,029 --> 00:10:30,640
having

193
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:34,170
what was what was sorry and why is when
students where student having problems

194
00:10:34,170 --> 00:10:39,990
finding all programs in

195
00:10:39,990 --> 00:10:43,449
the term sign

196
00:10:43,449 --> 00:10:48,059
yep its something completely different
witnesses not

197
00:10:48,059 --> 00:10:51,900
is it like it is. and your students know
what operating system is me said no no

198
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:54,740
they know that there are some computers
in English in some computers in French

199
00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:56,160
so they didn't even have a

200
00:10:56,160 --> 00:11:00,149
a means I love love conceptualizing why
is suddenly things moved around a screen

201
00:11:00,149 --> 00:11:03,890
writer to them it could just look like
technology was completely broken right

202
00:11:03,890 --> 00:11:06,569
nominees are things with the human
beings were knowingly we have all had

203
00:11:06,569 --> 00:11:09,410
tremendous amounts practice and these
are folks who maybe haven't seen a

204
00:11:09,410 --> 00:11:11,920
computer as often as we had so they had
no means

205
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:16,370
supplies in this on they also said other
things that he didn't understand and he

206
00:11:16,370 --> 00:11:17,949
was so is struggling to

207
00:11:17,949 --> 00:11:21,290
and you notice or to figure out what why
they're saying in on

208
00:11:21,290 --> 00:11:24,709
this was something that his students
said to him ominous I'm switching his

209
00:11:24,709 --> 00:11:26,250
foot in a sample

210
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:29,750
in a puddle of water and he was like
that is totally illogical and irrational

211
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:33,029
why did they say that and we have a
hypothesis and I'd like to see hands

212
00:11:33,029 --> 00:11:34,970
once again why why it was your peers

213
00:11:34,970 --> 00:11:39,250
is didn't thinking yes

214
00:11:39,250 --> 00:11:41,790
exactly right could in a muddy puddle
you can see the moment that was a

215
00:11:41,790 --> 00:11:45,010
perfectly rational thing to say and he
was like these people have no logic

216
00:11:45,010 --> 00:11:48,839
so as anyway so he was going to say I
want these people to see logic and

217
00:11:48,839 --> 00:11:51,819
reason that's not a direct quote but he
came very close to saying man

218
00:11:51,819 --> 00:11:55,550
I'm rain he never figured out these
logics my said in a look

219
00:11:55,550 --> 00:11:59,000
they have their own cultural logic they
have alleged that the agreed upon with

220
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,800
the people around them I like there are
things that make sense to them because

221
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:02,610
they have

222
00:12:02,610 --> 00:12:06,439
use for come to it together by observing
the world around them by observing

223
00:12:06,439 --> 00:12:09,699
the operating system that may be
suddenly change rate that by observing

224
00:12:09,699 --> 00:12:11,559
the puddles the inner member

225
00:12:11,559 --> 00:12:16,399
water so he says many cultures and
Hanley B word you use when you don't

226
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:19,220
understand what's going on

227
00:12:19,220 --> 00:12:22,529
home

228
00:12:22,529 --> 00:12:26,279
in I'm demonized him too quickly and was
like no we're not on his side you're on

229
00:12:26,279 --> 00:12:27,699
your side so

230
00:12:27,699 --> 00:12:30,850
yet I was the point at which I was like
hmm

231
00:12:30,850 --> 00:12:34,029
number you can likely blame him he was
just going off the start

232
00:12:34,029 --> 00:12:38,520
I culture where is studies culture on
here

233
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:41,640
to the left's just

234
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:47,770
where where to the well what where are
where which which fields what we talkin

235
00:12:47,770 --> 00:12:51,309
inter-party Sorrento and Marjorie
several Islam further of sociology in

236
00:12:51,309 --> 00:12:51,720
Psych

237
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:55,720
right

238
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:58,959
so he's not even I mean like

239
00:12:58,959 --> 00:13:02,399
really culture itself and values really
more history culture sociologist so is

240
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:04,699
the study of social structures mostly so

241
00:13:04,699 --> 00:13:07,209
and and so a

242
00:13:07,209 --> 00:13:10,319
who what can we say about that way

243
00:13:10,319 --> 00:13:13,879
I'll arm now as we will establish a
reason he he believes that basically

244
00:13:13,879 --> 00:13:15,569
unless parents less rigorous ring

245
00:13:15,569 --> 00:13:19,720
so yes he'll run love this guy said
first ball he basically was saying other

246
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:21,569
cultural logics don't matter

247
00:13:21,569 --> 00:13:24,959
because they're not based on empirical
evidence that was the thing that you say

248
00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:25,999
is these people are not

249
00:13:25,999 --> 00:13:29,309
Rasta rationally reasoning based on
what's around them which i think was

250
00:13:29,309 --> 00:13:33,869
notice and he said other issues but we
also say otherwise doing research to

251
00:13:33,869 --> 00:13:34,970
understand the world

252
00:13:34,970 --> 00:13:38,089
don't matter because the computer but
the real problem is asshole said was

253
00:13:38,089 --> 00:13:41,089
everything my girlfriend is done for the
past seven years is worthless

254
00:13:41,089 --> 00:13:44,410
even though I don't understand its eyes
like since I had a

255
00:13:44,410 --> 00:13:48,069
you stay in Africa for another couple
years just to steer

256
00:13:48,069 --> 00:13:52,559
he came back peddling um so he wanna
know

257
00:13:52,559 --> 00:13:56,769
why a group of people are acting a
certain way how do you ask that question

258
00:13:56,769 --> 00:14:03,110
will you do science to it how you
scientifically know how humans are

259
00:14:03,110 --> 00:14:03,699
behaving

260
00:14:03,699 --> 00:14:07,589
I'm let's go back to school for question
where it fits on here um

261
00:14:07,589 --> 00:14:11,050
it matters more pure why don't we do
math

262
00:14:11,050 --> 00:14:13,899
everything think on this for a second
and give me some hands because this is

263
00:14:13,899 --> 00:14:14,720
sort of an answer

264
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:18,910
text mark map is more pure and more
rigorous why don't we do math to

265
00:14:18,910 --> 00:14:20,759
absolutely everything or should be do
math

266
00:14:20,759 --> 00:14:27,759
absolutely everything would

267
00:14:29,949 --> 00:14:33,610
they won always react the same way to
them some sailors were still think

268
00:14:33,610 --> 00:14:38,939
humans or to the scientific term for
saying some %um

269
00:14:38,939 --> 00:14:45,939
sorry if he if you if I have called you
please don't so %um

270
00:14:46,209 --> 00:14:50,179
%uh we don't understand the components
in the system and therefore we can

271
00:14:50,179 --> 00:14:52,129
understand not medically up as well for
us

272
00:14:52,129 --> 00:14:55,670
thank you and furthest in the back and
actor

273
00:14:55,670 --> 00:15:01,319
yes I'm

274
00:15:01,319 --> 00:15:04,730
applications one

275
00:15:04,730 --> 00:15:09,220
okay so we do use mathematics
understands like what kinda look

276
00:15:09,220 --> 00:15:16,220
anywhere using mathematics understand
human behavior would you say

277
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:23,920
okay so we're worse we're looking at a
at big social institutions and sorta

278
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:27,100
on what kinds and how the hell ya
preserve again I heard from you quite a

279
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:27,410
bit

280
00:15:27,410 --> 00:15:34,410
German over there standing on in

281
00:15:37,970 --> 00:15:44,970
min

282
00:15:47,020 --> 00:15:50,220
that's also very well said right so
there are things that we do do Matthew

283
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:51,870
Wright murders were to walk through

284
00:15:51,870 --> 00:15:55,880
which part so social behavior on you
know people we'd was worth are amenable

285
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:57,210
to Matt and other parts art

286
00:15:57,210 --> 00:16:00,470
on it's all sorted exporters I will make
sure to keep moving here in another

287
00:16:00,470 --> 00:16:02,020
question is why do we do biology

288
00:16:02,020 --> 00:16:06,540
everything we humans do or should we do
biology them in humans do when the back

289
00:16:06,540 --> 00:16:06,860
yeah

290
00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:13,860
what doesn't really take reminiscent
again

291
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:28,950
members particular not good I think it
understanding external environment right

292
00:16:28,950 --> 00:16:30,790
Yes to external environment you're
sending

293
00:16:30,790 --> 00:16:36,529
a human's external environment which
field we look at here sirs it was field

294
00:16:36,529 --> 00:16:38,080
we talk about pressure on my ringer

295
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:41,610
so the only other other procedural myron

296
00:16:41,610 --> 00:16:45,750
biology right yes owner there are
multiple factors that should maybe study

297
00:16:45,750 --> 00:16:46,730
in different ways right

298
00:16:46,730 --> 00:16:49,820
and what the %uh the whole point about
women as i think is also quite good

299
00:16:49,820 --> 00:16:56,079
on math caster is is is good for women's
rights so that that ends up boo

300
00:16:56,079 --> 00:16:59,480
its kind always actually any any field
here feels like it could have cast your

301
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:00,170
ultimately but

302
00:17:00,170 --> 00:17:03,170
what strikes me as a lot of time on

303
00:17:03,170 --> 00:17:06,860
I mean you you have a massive
environment take into account so you're

304
00:17:06,860 --> 00:17:09,419
you're sorta trying you're always it
when you're doing research I was trying

305
00:17:09,419 --> 00:17:11,470
to sort of like sort out certain
variables

306
00:17:11,470 --> 00:17:15,220
and so there yeah there there will be
things that will

307
00:17:15,220 --> 00:17:18,390
pop-up there appear to be no is

308
00:17:18,390 --> 00:17:22,209
their pure things that pop up there more
like history right there are white why

309
00:17:22,209 --> 00:17:24,419
did this happen you have to look back in
time

310
00:17:24,419 --> 00:17:28,039
and math isn't necessarily good at
expressing time biology is not

311
00:17:28,039 --> 00:17:29,690
necessarily good

312
00:17:29,690 --> 00:17:33,690
dependent disliked and how you want to
document what you wanna document was

313
00:17:33,690 --> 00:17:36,669
keep moving and such a degree but none
as this was a very good discussion like

314
00:17:36,669 --> 00:17:37,230
the sort of

315
00:17:37,230 --> 00:17:40,970
and for trying to come to a
histologically which is the study of

316
00:17:40,970 --> 00:17:41,520
knowledge

317
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:45,340
not knowledge wise why is it that we we
come to the reasons that we do

318
00:17:45,340 --> 00:17:49,500
I was work I'm on a more specific
question right so that we can sort apply

319
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:53,400
the reasoning behind things here say we
wanted to answer the question why can't

320
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:55,380
johnnie encrypt by doing research

321
00:17:55,380 --> 00:17:59,299
how could we do a quantitative a
mathematical study

322
00:17:59,299 --> 00:18:02,580
about why people are and aren't

323
00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:07,559
encrypting what could we do what could
be

324
00:18:07,559 --> 00:18:10,740
how can we do a mathematical study about
why people aren't encrypting you look at

325
00:18:10,740 --> 00:18:11,880
you might have an answer

326
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:18,880
in a blue right there we're stretching
good

327
00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:27,750
okay so if we're doing surveys so sorry
do you mean like people writing things

328
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:28,700
down for us

329
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:31,730
into question so that would actually be
qualitative right means we're getting

330
00:18:31,730 --> 00:18:35,520
you to some extent you're getting a a
word response how would you like sheer

331
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:38,170
pure math to Glenn Greenwald my he's not
doing it yes

332
00:18:38,170 --> 00:18:41,870
I'm can't remember people that have

333
00:18:41,870 --> 00:18:44,600
access to encryption program is an
interesting one right so how would we

334
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:45,870
know if they had access

335
00:18:45,870 --> 00:18:49,210
did it im do they have internet access

336
00:18:49,210 --> 00:18:53,010
does that also tell us whether they're
aware of the other encryption programs

337
00:18:53,010 --> 00:18:56,100
no right so we already missed something
there

338
00:18:56,100 --> 00:19:00,160
and so we have to not just look at do
they have

339
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:03,240
is there the possibility that they could
get it because they have the Internet

340
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:07,620
but we also have to know are they aware
and awareness begins to goes back into

341
00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:11,440
sociology or history right like those
are sorted more about human questions

342
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:15,850
back over there by the window yes start

343
00:19:15,850 --> 00:19:20,540
how do you roll

344
00:19:20,540 --> 00:19:25,740
use Skype your chest crook somebody's
trolling keeping here yes

345
00:19:25,740 --> 00:19:29,380
on

346
00:19:29,380 --> 00:19:33,070
monitor on yes we're going to get to
that one shortly yes

347
00:19:33,070 --> 00:19:36,980
yes this one thing that matters act like
the number of things that are counted

348
00:19:36,980 --> 00:19:39,970
about your behavior minor a really kind
of fascinating interesting I will say

349
00:19:39,970 --> 00:19:40,680
that more so

350
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:44,240
a dislike the idea like the idea access
is good but they may also have the a

351
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:47,140
question whereas women back to the
cameras there %um

352
00:19:47,140 --> 00:19:54,140
in

353
00:19:57,590 --> 00:20:01,150
okay so that's more than a B study right
so you you arm

354
00:20:01,150 --> 00:20:04,440
hey if you have a email services some
sort you a

355
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:09,030
basically from put the option to of to
say it's public public

356
00:20:09,030 --> 00:20:12,040
popup that says hey you can get your
email to some people and not others

357
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:15,970
maybe he'd change the color of blue like
the way Google changed like that right

358
00:20:15,970 --> 00:20:18,880
up 15 colors blue and to figure out
which one works best like

359
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:22,440
that's super quite rightly we're really
getting into counts

360
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:25,500
love cool who is picked things up

361
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:32,500
then how do we know why multiple Twitter
is right there more quantitative they

362
00:20:33,860 --> 00:20:34,980
are numb

363
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:38,030
she already giving people an answer and
you can simply count the number

364
00:20:38,030 --> 00:20:40,150
responsibly girl age that begins
disorders

365
00:20:40,150 --> 00:20:43,620
simple five in number variable special
you get something written out

366
00:20:43,620 --> 00:20:47,290
um once you've you've gone through
enough research training that you had to

367
00:20:47,290 --> 00:20:47,710
like

368
00:20:47,710 --> 00:20:52,060
codifying people's responses when they
have open and response is the more

369
00:20:52,060 --> 00:20:54,370
you're like oh god I'm never doing this
again

370
00:20:54,370 --> 00:20:57,370
right because it's that takes a little
work me anything it takes

371
00:20:57,370 --> 00:21:02,370
is a lotta love I am going in and you
have to define with your other

372
00:21:02,370 --> 00:21:03,200
researchers

373
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:07,080
is this an example of what we're trying
to count here so somebody says

374
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:10,780
on yes I use Skype for example

375
00:21:10,780 --> 00:21:14,850
do we count that as using encryption are
not because are they actually aware that

376
00:21:14,850 --> 00:21:16,930
there's encryption it are they not aware

377
00:21:16,930 --> 00:21:21,840
right to you you then begin among your
researchers to define what counts as

378
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:23,050
evidence and what doesn't

379
00:21:23,050 --> 00:21:26,820
so I will talk a little bit more about
having a researcher define not had

380
00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:28,260
bruises having the

381
00:21:28,260 --> 00:21:31,600
people you're studying to find that in a
moment because that's kind of

382
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:33,970
those are slightly different things may
actually end up being in two different

383
00:21:33,970 --> 00:21:35,130
fields on

384
00:21:35,130 --> 00:21:38,840
love social study arm rights weasel

385
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:43,260
I think things which were intended is on
you can sorted we said the a beat as you

386
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:45,420
can see whether they picked it up if
they if they got

387
00:21:45,420 --> 00:21:48,590
this kinda pop-up verses that kinda
pop-up brain but

388
00:21:48,590 --> 00:21:51,670
on that still doesn't quite tell us why
all we know

389
00:21:51,670 --> 00:21:55,730
is I'm in a good correlation opposition
right now if it's if its yearly between

390
00:21:55,730 --> 00:21:56,690
like yes you have a

391
00:21:56,690 --> 00:22:01,360
a pop-up says encrypt purses you had no
popup that doesn't necessarily

392
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:04,270
let me know tells you that yet if you
have a popup to find it began to see

393
00:22:04,270 --> 00:22:05,070
more popups

394
00:22:05,070 --> 00:22:08,670
you begin disorders not have the answer
of why likewise having

395
00:22:08,670 --> 00:22:15,670
when a backhand yes

396
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:26,150
Ramzan

397
00:22:26,150 --> 00:22:30,040
rates yes you can begin to control a lot
of variables are the ones worth nice

398
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:30,720
things

399
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:34,890
abouts and known as you can sorta do
that I love assertive

400
00:22:34,890 --> 00:22:38,250
a the problems I have sort of multiple
tracks I could go on this on this

401
00:22:38,250 --> 00:22:40,470
particular I wanna but we're getting

402
00:22:40,470 --> 00:22:43,910
more talking about a/b testing the
second I'm so the point is generally not

403
00:22:43,910 --> 00:22:46,780
like once again especially if you're if
you're controlling the environment

404
00:22:46,780 --> 00:22:50,090
you're still not totally sure why people
are choosing one thing or whether or not

405
00:22:50,090 --> 00:22:53,130
on you really have to begin to talk to
them that done

406
00:22:53,130 --> 00:22:57,690
um we could for example a

407
00:22:57,690 --> 00:23:01,250
let's see if we r if we're going to try
to find out why

408
00:23:01,250 --> 00:23:04,320
I what we do to find out why

409
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:11,320
what other things could be due yes right
there you

410
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:15,320
mean so so somebody in a room

411
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:18,470
on prolly elaborate or maybe even at
their house whatever and observe them as

412
00:23:18,470 --> 00:23:18,900
they

413
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:22,070
as you said and you try to set up K how
do we know then

414
00:23:22,070 --> 00:23:25,520
if they're going to encrypt again
rightly so

415
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:28,120
so there are certain things you can know
within a lot you can certainly know

416
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:32,230
whether your interface is working but
it's really hard to predict behavior

417
00:23:32,230 --> 00:23:35,350
going forward because the lab is worth
an unusual situation without me back

418
00:23:35,350 --> 00:23:35,910
again yes

419
00:23:35,910 --> 00:23:42,910
%ah

420
00:23:43,030 --> 00:23:49,210
yes

421
00:23:49,210 --> 00:23:52,440
exactly does that is a very good point
right so you can create a need to

422
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:55,639
encrypt especially if you're in the lab
their dynamics in lab right like a lab

423
00:23:55,639 --> 00:23:57,490
experiment on human being is going to

424
00:23:57,490 --> 00:24:01,080
be in the context in the frame is Irving
often says I love

425
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:04,470
this is an experiment the researcher
want something of me what does the

426
00:24:04,470 --> 00:24:08,090
researcher wants right so that creates
an entirely different setting

427
00:24:08,090 --> 00:24:11,350
that the person might be reacting to not
in a way that's all natural right

428
00:24:11,350 --> 00:24:15,070
and but need is a is also interesting
word like if we go out and observe

429
00:24:15,070 --> 00:24:15,850
people

430
00:24:15,850 --> 00:24:19,240
we can begin to find out what what did
he say there need is right then it will

431
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:22,840
immediately other questions like what
marketing team do with us. the marketing

432
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:23,340
team

433
00:24:23,340 --> 00:24:28,370
about encryption what is the tool the
marketing team for example

434
00:24:28,370 --> 00:24:31,960
Lynn the

435
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:35,139
action but like can sell this is not
social media

436
00:24:35,139 --> 00:24:38,809
right so so what what if you think I'm
like what marking teams do what is there

437
00:24:38,809 --> 00:24:41,600
a tool that the use research why some

438
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:46,440
focus group yes focus groups exactly
what is the problem with with getting a

439
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:47,620
lot of people in the room

440
00:24:47,620 --> 00:24:51,419
I in a focus group in saying so what do
you think about encryption

441
00:24:51,419 --> 00:24:56,470
what's wrong with yes up

442
00:24:56,470 --> 00:25:01,149
%uh all game on

443
00:25:01,149 --> 00:25:08,149
all

444
00:25:09,090 --> 00:25:13,610
right

445
00:25:13,610 --> 00:25:18,860
okay would abuses and that's it is the
means a lot of times behind the scenes

446
00:25:18,860 --> 00:25:20,450
but if we're talking to people

447
00:25:20,450 --> 00:25:24,550
you know about about asking it was worth
more asking them that the major flaw

448
00:25:24,550 --> 00:25:25,660
there is there's a

449
00:25:25,660 --> 00:25:29,090
support is the may not be aware right
what else might be not be aware of

450
00:25:29,090 --> 00:25:33,200
your yes

451
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:36,820
yes it is the major problem focus groups
don't you working team tell you to focus

452
00:25:36,820 --> 00:25:39,940
groups because not only are they they're
reacting to the researcher

453
00:25:39,940 --> 00:25:42,630
they're also they're reacting to each
other so you're not necessarily that

454
00:25:42,630 --> 00:25:44,580
focus groups are really not the greatest
tool for

455
00:25:44,580 --> 00:25:47,920
pretty much anything on right in so

456
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:51,880
yes has to be a self-report data is also
unreliable like when people tell you I'm

457
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:53,400
going to do this right to do this

458
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:57,450
arm frequently they're not mean so a lot
of times people miss estimate what they

459
00:25:57,450 --> 00:26:00,200
do most often particularly awesome how
often do you do something that's not

460
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:01,430
something you ought to Connolly

461
00:26:01,430 --> 00:26:06,040
Sam um so I started going on with more
more point was thinking about things

462
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:07,230
missus arm

463
00:26:07,230 --> 00:26:10,650
something you can observe got my Sikri
secure tool use this is my contact list

464
00:26:10,650 --> 00:26:11,490
in Jersey

465
00:26:11,490 --> 00:26:15,210
I'm which is a tool that supports
encryption voice calls arm

466
00:26:15,210 --> 00:26:18,260
look research questions could be
generate about encryption to use based

467
00:26:18,260 --> 00:26:19,010
on what we see here

468
00:26:19,010 --> 00:26:22,360
freeze me a question

469
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:29,360
asking st. Avalon work today yes his
decision

470
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:32,470
yeah but why would we think the sheet a
blue jeans are incurred we've been

471
00:26:32,470 --> 00:26:35,190
talking about car even talking about how
to indicate the people in a message

472
00:26:35,190 --> 00:26:37,060
secures like which car should be used

473
00:26:37,060 --> 00:26:41,030
but blue is in Maxim and unlike his red
dad then there's a green card line is I

474
00:26:41,030 --> 00:26:41,300
think

475
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:44,330
honestly the collar fight is like my
least favorite UX things like there are

476
00:26:44,330 --> 00:26:45,510
no true answers

477
00:26:45,510 --> 00:26:49,480
some countries some some languages only
have words for like

478
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:53,030
dark and lights or like they don't have
a distinction between blue and greens

479
00:26:53,030 --> 00:26:55,890
like you don't even mess with that I
don't think I think it's too much what

480
00:26:55,890 --> 00:26:59,230
else can we ask about this this
particular on things here yes

481
00:26:59,230 --> 00:27:04,830
on how you tested the person who's in
crafting how do you know who they are

482
00:27:04,830 --> 00:27:07,530
that's an interesting question actually
so that's that's one thing we can

483
00:27:07,530 --> 00:27:09,570
observe but that there anything else we
could ask

484
00:27:09,570 --> 00:27:16,420
yes how do I know it's yours is doing
that is actually something maybe more

485
00:27:16,420 --> 00:27:17,210
than a

486
00:27:17,210 --> 00:27:20,490
user would ask %uh researcher that's
actually a really good question but how

487
00:27:20,490 --> 00:27:20,790
does

488
00:27:20,790 --> 00:27:24,000
yes these are how do you know like how
do you know it's a good thing I think my

489
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:27,360
favorite question about like this is the
entire idiot miss a contactless right

490
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:31,030
has won a major problems we're facing an
encryption is if you need to have a

491
00:27:31,030 --> 00:27:32,110
trusted network

492
00:27:32,110 --> 00:27:36,660
and you need to create a thin air do you
suck down your Google contacts

493
00:27:36,660 --> 00:27:40,910
then you have all your Google contacts
that might not be safe so like this is

494
00:27:40,910 --> 00:27:44,910
this is a major challenge on but once
again to see if his words we could do an

495
00:27:44,910 --> 00:27:47,210
example you do a test for research go
okay

496
00:27:47,210 --> 00:27:51,320
on have learnt server for gin seeping
the software in Goa

497
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:54,190
what is the the end of the contact list
how many people are on there really need

498
00:27:54,190 --> 00:27:54,850
to know who they are

499
00:27:54,850 --> 00:27:58,110
right but it would be good to have on

500
00:27:58,110 --> 00:28:02,460
some sort of you know said we would
begin the court correlations between

501
00:28:02,460 --> 00:28:04,580
like if somebody is not using it all
that much

502
00:28:04,580 --> 00:28:07,920
is related to this worthy simply cease
using a tool for long periods of time is

503
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:09,150
because they just don't happen

504
00:28:09,150 --> 00:28:13,580
on the couple's certain religions refine
hine I think we have to some extent

505
00:28:13,580 --> 00:28:14,690
determined

506
00:28:14,690 --> 00:28:17,960
and I for making a leap year between we
haven't quite gotten I got there but

507
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:22,280
on we we decided that a/b testing would
be pretty cool to do right like a/b

508
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:24,330
testing is is a way that you can
actually

509
00:28:24,330 --> 00:28:27,980
get a sense a people's behavior on
without

510
00:28:27,980 --> 00:28:31,290
are bringing an end to any testing once
again is is popping up something

511
00:28:31,290 --> 00:28:34,650
on their machine or or having your
suffer send you

512
00:28:34,650 --> 00:28:38,560
information about events like did the
log into the lockout how long have they

513
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:41,030
been on you know other other piece of
information like that

514
00:28:41,030 --> 00:28:45,790
on in the Internet makes a this kind of
observing an actual human be really easy

515
00:28:45,790 --> 00:28:48,470
so we don't have to do a focus group we
don't have to get them to give a

516
00:28:48,470 --> 00:28:49,570
self-report data

517
00:28:49,570 --> 00:28:53,450
we actually fine now would be due all
major companies do it all the time good

518
00:28:53,450 --> 00:28:56,910
as it is but do they are very very sexy
data if your Social Research

519
00:28:56,910 --> 00:29:03,370
exceeded yes so but of course and we
recently found out where that ends up

520
00:29:03,370 --> 00:29:04,110
hurting

521
00:29:04,110 --> 00:29:08,310
so I I don't know how many people have
Facebook emotional manipulation Sony

522
00:29:08,310 --> 00:29:12,060
and most people know me because that's
what you hear Facebook did

523
00:29:12,060 --> 00:29:15,780
emotional manipulation studies on users
by selecting what messages they see on

524
00:29:15,780 --> 00:29:16,500
the wall

525
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:20,450
by emotional tone so they would only
show you the friends were saying happy

526
00:29:20,450 --> 00:29:23,160
things where they would only three
different interesting sad things and it

527
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:25,380
worked at how that impacted people's
behavior

528
00:29:25,380 --> 00:29:29,030
um needless to say it is kinda defeats
the purpose if you're looking at

529
00:29:29,030 --> 00:29:32,510
security tools it can defeat the purpose
of privacy protection and also love

530
00:29:32,510 --> 00:29:33,050
ethics

531
00:29:33,050 --> 00:29:36,429
my hand like and there's a lot of
discussion

532
00:29:36,429 --> 00:29:39,910
in certain groups that I am enough

533
00:29:39,910 --> 00:29:43,470
you know should because in a in academia
if you if you're in the ivory tower

534
00:29:43,470 --> 00:29:44,050
furious

535
00:29:44,050 --> 00:29:47,740
University you have to go to a group
called institutional review board and

536
00:29:47,740 --> 00:29:48,560
they tell you

537
00:29:48,560 --> 00:29:52,110
yes you're doing things that are safe no
you are not so they're the ones who say

538
00:29:52,110 --> 00:29:55,330
no you may not administer electric
shocks to pregnant women to find out if

539
00:29:55,330 --> 00:29:57,160
you know whatever happens

540
00:29:57,160 --> 00:30:00,080
yeah they're very very strict like I
RBI's are quite strict in assorted 10

541
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:02,530
reasons I think Facebook is to have sex
your data

542
00:30:02,530 --> 00:30:06,520
is there's no be telling them no right
on but for us for those of us who were

543
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:09,100
in a community that cares a lot about
saddam

544
00:30:09,100 --> 00:30:12,470
protection privacy security anonymity

545
00:30:12,470 --> 00:30:16,230
these things are sorta difficult for a
little bit back to square one

546
00:30:16,230 --> 00:30:20,630
about how to do that research and that
is kind of a whole other talk

547
00:30:20,630 --> 00:30:24,000
I think albeit a disgusting usually
talks tomorrow

548
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:27,220
and we also have a usability me up
tomorrow no makeup on for common join us

549
00:30:27,220 --> 00:30:28,540
to talk about his ability in

550
00:30:28,540 --> 00:30:32,330
and secure tools arm yes so

551
00:30:32,330 --> 00:30:36,810
and will on wrecking do many beat us who
he had a double-double with a sign

552
00:30:36,810 --> 00:30:40,960
happen huh arm rights

553
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:44,419
okay we've talked over all that power I
move my signs around

554
00:30:44,419 --> 00:30:47,990
my party's on anyway by Lee it anytime
you see

555
00:30:47,990 --> 00:30:52,070
a study reported in the news about user
behavior about human behavior you should

556
00:30:52,070 --> 00:30:55,130
be asking these questions about the
research she should be asking

557
00:30:55,130 --> 00:30:58,919
how did they do this how did they ask a
question how did they get their data

558
00:30:58,919 --> 00:31:02,840
do I believe it's valid right do I
believe that this was a valid way to get

559
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:03,630
the right answer

560
00:31:03,630 --> 00:31:07,560
about on this kind of thing when trying
to get out here

561
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:10,810
is then simply doing I'm as you probably
know by now I'm

562
00:31:10,810 --> 00:31:13,880
I'm trying to get to the point that
quantitative Mathematical Sciences

563
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:16,230
simply not the right tool for the job

564
00:31:16,230 --> 00:31:19,900
right it's not the right tool for asking
questions about why human beings do

565
00:31:19,900 --> 00:31:21,270
things great tool

566
00:31:21,270 --> 00:31:24,730
but it doesn't usually tell you what
people's logic and reasoning is

567
00:31:24,730 --> 00:31:25,850
themselves

568
00:31:25,850 --> 00:31:29,520
um and this is where I mean your belief

569
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:32,780
in science is wrong if you find yourself
believing that do any more scientific

570
00:31:32,780 --> 00:31:34,169
study is better

571
00:31:34,169 --> 00:31:38,480
comity more statistical study is better
than an anecdotal study or a

572
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:41,600
you know an observation study I am

573
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:45,350
you're doing science wrong right because
just doing math to it doesn't make it a

574
00:31:45,350 --> 00:31:46,830
better science right

575
00:31:46,830 --> 00:31:51,310
science doesn't ask that you believe in
its I asked you interrogate

576
00:31:51,310 --> 00:31:54,540
right that is the idea right so you want
to make sure that you are

577
00:31:54,540 --> 00:31:59,310
um asking questions the right way in
asking questions I'll report you see

578
00:31:59,310 --> 00:32:03,100
and I got a brief and his back me up on
this one am

579
00:32:03,100 --> 00:32:06,460
so I Z beer and Richard finds

580
00:32:06,460 --> 00:32:09,960
cargo cult science paper as a that he
did it was a

581
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:14,280
a convocation turd Celtics teams I'm he
called out things that pretend to be

582
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:17,850
science but aren't we actually sites my
field educational research is an example

583
00:32:17,850 --> 00:32:20,560
and I said I very expensive degree

584
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:24,230
so but I actually I agree with fun and I
really do there's a lot about

585
00:32:24,230 --> 00:32:25,690
educational research out there

586
00:32:25,690 --> 00:32:29,200
and a lot of really terrible research
about people and cultures may twenty

587
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:30,870
spirits is the a

588
00:32:30,870 --> 00:32:34,140
a narrow cognitions studies on ethics

589
00:32:34,140 --> 00:32:37,190
we can tell you where ethical part of
brain years

590
00:32:37,190 --> 00:32:40,450
you know it's like caveman questions I
think a lot of the time

591
00:32:40,450 --> 00:32:44,310
arm I think it's really the more social
research study pretends to be hard

592
00:32:44,310 --> 00:32:47,090
science the worse it is I think that was
basically would find was calling out

593
00:32:47,090 --> 00:32:49,760
right if you're trying if you're doing
it the wrong way then yes it's bad

594
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:50,850
science

595
00:32:50,850 --> 00:32:53,970
on they're not the right methods for
this thing so

596
00:32:53,970 --> 00:32:57,130
I let's argue the actually being the
field and observing people

597
00:32:57,130 --> 00:33:00,500
is more Imperial right you're actually
observe anything that happens when

598
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:03,200
you're studying culture than bringing
people into lab

599
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:08,470
right um from my is the plan for
disclosure my my pin is that for many

600
00:33:08,470 --> 00:33:11,220
questions logically anthropology is
generally more readers

601
00:33:11,220 --> 00:33:14,270
rigorous them sociology or psychology

602
00:33:14,270 --> 00:33:18,160
and apologies Franz Boas the or friends
bowlers

603
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:21,320
on terrible visual pun I

604
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:26,130
the founder of anthropology is going on
on entomology holds that the observation

605
00:33:26,130 --> 00:33:29,040
and multiple mines in communication
behavior

606
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:33,510
con conversing with multiple mines and
participation in people's daily life is

607
00:33:33,510 --> 00:33:37,340
the strongest means understanding
people's rationale for what they do

608
00:33:37,340 --> 00:33:42,160
arm laboratory tests promote purports to
eliminate variables

609
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:45,850
from social interaction but think about
that's actually kinda counterproductive

610
00:33:45,850 --> 00:33:48,840
right you don't necessarily want to
eliminate parables you want to know what

611
00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:49,090
is

612
00:33:49,020 --> 00:33:52,240
actually happening right you are you're
looking for social variables and when

613
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:52,700
you

614
00:33:52,700 --> 00:33:55,870
have a lab study once again you
introduce the variable love like the

615
00:33:55,870 --> 00:33:57,460
researcher wants me to do this right

616
00:33:57,460 --> 00:34:01,750
cell on ands

617
00:34:01,750 --> 00:34:04,850
participation is a big part of it to you
on a time

618
00:34:04,850 --> 00:34:08,589
what you're doing is an end parts is
going out hands observing but also doing

619
00:34:08,589 --> 00:34:10,070
what people do use your

620
00:34:10,070 --> 00:34:13,620
being a daughter in a an Eskimo
community in finding out what is right

621
00:34:13,620 --> 00:34:15,179
and wrong to do as a daughter

622
00:34:15,179 --> 00:34:18,450
to begin to learn as a person reacting
to on

623
00:34:18,450 --> 00:34:21,690
you know the people around you what is
correct was incorrect if your question

624
00:34:21,690 --> 00:34:24,960
is why are people asking like this you
need to observe what people

625
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:29,210
awesome tell each other on writes about
what is correct or not correct

626
00:34:29,210 --> 00:34:32,649
you need to participate in and break
counteracting with each other and you

627
00:34:32,649 --> 00:34:35,210
need to ask people why they're behaving
like this

628
00:34:35,210 --> 00:34:38,570
I am you need to know the reasoning that
people are falling on the behavior

629
00:34:38,570 --> 00:34:42,089
certain way and when the reinforcing
each other's choice is a member I am

630
00:34:42,089 --> 00:34:46,960
going home going to the park so and
apology in sociology are the

631
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:51,140
studies people interacting with each
other psychology is tens we study one

632
00:34:51,140 --> 00:34:53,859
had like what's going on in a person's
head which may be why

633
00:34:53,859 --> 00:34:57,030
I think earlier I had a little box from
endelman rosing social psych is worse

634
00:34:57,030 --> 00:34:57,800
than he deserves

635
00:34:57,800 --> 00:35:02,790
social psychology because II titles
Rizzo is worth a look which method are

636
00:35:02,790 --> 00:35:05,700
you using which question you actually
asking if you're

637
00:35:05,700 --> 00:35:09,100
thinking the exact same time about one
had multiple hands on it but something

638
00:35:09,100 --> 00:35:10,130
or I'm

639
00:35:10,130 --> 00:35:13,740
I'm the idea of doing something wrong

640
00:35:13,740 --> 00:35:18,240
is actually a method to the sociology
and anthropology some field called s new

641
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:20,740
methodology has a very long name for a
field

642
00:35:20,740 --> 00:35:25,080
on the founder also has the very end
long name Harold Garfinkel

643
00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:29,020
and his writing is among the most which
was a hard read Saul sum it up for you

644
00:35:29,020 --> 00:35:32,180
home it's it's really like unreadable I

645
00:35:32,180 --> 00:35:35,560
but if you is basic idea is arm

646
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:39,100
if you break a social convention that is
the best way to learn what social

647
00:35:39,100 --> 00:35:41,990
convention is because views ECU go into
a bank

648
00:35:41,990 --> 00:35:45,810
and you cut in line everybody will crack
you say no the line is over there the

649
00:35:45,810 --> 00:35:47,850
end line is over there right so

650
00:35:47,850 --> 00:35:50,990
actually getting in and disrupting
what's going on actually business gets

651
00:35:50,990 --> 00:35:54,050
done in user test as well and and Peter
signs he suddenly

652
00:35:54,050 --> 00:35:56,700
make a window behave in a way that
people don't expect to begin to learn a

653
00:35:56,700 --> 00:35:59,260
little bit more about what they did
expects rates an answer to tell you

654
00:35:59,260 --> 00:36:00,370
those things

655
00:36:00,370 --> 00:36:04,420
on so it in topology national mythology
these days

656
00:36:04,420 --> 00:36:07,680
observational fields our empirical right
they are

657
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:11,120
generalizing about things that happen
reliably they happen over and over again

658
00:36:11,120 --> 00:36:14,680
you don't just as an anthropologist say
oh I saw this person do this once right

659
00:36:14,680 --> 00:36:19,520
you say multiple times this happens I
ask somebody about it and he said yes

660
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:23,040
that's how it works and I interrupted
that process and somebody else interrupt

661
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:25,480
the process in their correct it on the
right way

662
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:28,730
these are not feel that just simply
statistics are laboratory regulation to

663
00:36:28,730 --> 00:36:30,690
a jeep a litany

664
00:36:30,690 --> 00:36:34,120
the difference between the social
sciences

665
00:36:34,120 --> 00:36:37,890
and the so-called hard sciences is the
difference between

666
00:36:37,890 --> 00:36:41,790
a logic that operates on what is
observer Bligh

667
00:36:41,790 --> 00:36:45,710
factual in the world I'm anthropology

668
00:36:45,710 --> 00:36:50,830
mom sorry that was bludgeon her what do
the hard sciences this one being held on

669
00:36:50,830 --> 00:36:51,670
a woman

670
00:36:51,670 --> 00:36:55,070
bludgeon the hard sciences right there's
a logic that

671
00:36:55,070 --> 00:36:58,070
operates on what is absurdly factual in
the world when you go and you do

672
00:36:58,070 --> 00:37:00,630
chemistry experiment you expected to
operate but same logic

673
00:37:00,630 --> 00:37:04,540
next time or biology experiment or
mathematical proof

674
00:37:04,540 --> 00:37:08,330
believes in things the same way on the

675
00:37:08,330 --> 00:37:11,410
soft sciences and through social psych
by contrast

676
00:37:11,410 --> 00:37:15,210
are the observable fact other logic

677
00:37:15,210 --> 00:37:18,390
a people's logic operating on the
world's right

678
00:37:18,390 --> 00:37:22,230
any logic itself is the object I'll

679
00:37:22,230 --> 00:37:26,170
observable a qualitative study right in
people's heads and actions

680
00:37:26,170 --> 00:37:29,500
and it's just not affected to try to
study is it was Corkran equation on a

681
00:37:29,500 --> 00:37:31,650
different reaction

682
00:37:31,650 --> 00:37:35,350
the people Comp Sci encountered in full
on E do repeatedly a biologic both in

683
00:37:35,350 --> 00:37:37,100
deciding where not to step

684
00:37:37,100 --> 00:37:40,520
and in deciding what to do when the
computer is reacting we expect

685
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:44,070
an active asking teacher was not a bad
strategy there he's didn't like that

686
00:37:44,070 --> 00:37:45,470
strategy has likewise

687
00:37:45,470 --> 00:37:49,550
why is that not ok you do your students
and Glee remark was applying logic

688
00:37:49,550 --> 00:37:52,810
busy journalist you didn't know how big
snowden story was an encryption seem

689
00:37:52,810 --> 00:37:56,760
like he was going to take a long time so
we just decided not to take the time

690
00:37:56,760 --> 00:38:00,410
relatively logical thing to do it's not
your logic right because you know more

691
00:38:00,410 --> 00:38:01,950
about encryption and monetize

692
00:38:01,950 --> 00:38:05,280
it's not a scientific logic but you
better believe the computer users who

693
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:08,650
don't share your culture are going to
apply it again and again probably the

694
00:38:08,650 --> 00:38:09,859
same way every time

695
00:38:09,859 --> 00:38:13,530
and as such it becomes a fact that you
must reckon with

696
00:38:13,530 --> 00:38:18,060
as a software developer in a scientist
unfortunately I see holders in the open

697
00:38:18,060 --> 00:38:19,900
source in security tool communities

698
00:38:19,900 --> 00:38:23,109
acting as if they are unaware that their
so called logical assumptions their

699
00:38:23,109 --> 00:38:25,589
desire to do math and science everything

700
00:38:25,589 --> 00:38:29,220
carries their own cultural logic with it
it's not pure

701
00:38:29,220 --> 00:38:33,100
it's not neutral and suffer carries
values me too

702
00:38:33,100 --> 00:38:35,740
you may want to think that when x is
objectively the right way to run a

703
00:38:35,740 --> 00:38:38,140
computer and Richard Stallman certainly
nuns

704
00:38:38,140 --> 00:38:42,609
actually not Linux or you can use mine
he called me out on our own already

705
00:38:42,609 --> 00:38:44,120
we'll get to that in a moment

706
00:38:44,120 --> 00:38:47,460
I'm you may be thinking Christian
rationing can improve computer use

707
00:38:47,460 --> 00:38:50,570
but neither these two police are true in
the abstract right

708
00:38:50,570 --> 00:38:54,300
there is no abstract and social behavior
generally being with unaware of your own

709
00:38:54,300 --> 00:38:55,730
values inhabits

710
00:38:55,730 --> 00:38:59,980
hurts the spread love the good work that
we all want to do

711
00:38:59,980 --> 00:39:04,950
%uh so yes world

712
00:39:04,950 --> 00:39:09,430
we can get a lousy miles or more
concrete in the world but that is a

713
00:39:09,430 --> 00:39:10,780
question for after

714
00:39:10,780 --> 00:39:14,080
I'm sorry now unlikely to finish this
mean we can get discussion afterwards

715
00:39:14,080 --> 00:39:15,570
part in the talks 'em

716
00:39:15,570 --> 00:39:19,109
Evan Moglen and the writer the GNU
Public License given incredibly

717
00:39:19,109 --> 00:39:20,700
appealing talk at the previous help

718
00:39:20,700 --> 00:39:26,520
and when she used vampires as a metaphor
for Apple products and Steve Jobs

719
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:29,600
it was pretty great looking at was
really just want the most beautiful

720
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:30,920
speeches and overheard

721
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:35,359
he said their their goal is to seduce
through the incredible beauty and makers

722
00:39:35,359 --> 00:39:39,890
dependence because just like them to sap
our precious bodily fluids

723
00:39:39,890 --> 00:39:43,370
right I thought I thought millions ideas
were beautifully phrased

724
00:39:43,370 --> 00:39:47,620
agreed with him for most women but then
I started working more closely with the

725
00:39:47,620 --> 00:39:50,859
open source community and I was
struggling daily to get a Linux computer

726
00:39:50,859 --> 00:39:53,640
to work without being completely
dependent on somebody else to get

727
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:54,940
anything done

728
00:39:54,940 --> 00:39:57,940
and I heard a lot of people on in that
community in the open source community

729
00:39:57,940 --> 00:39:59,950
repeating moments themes

730
00:39:59,950 --> 00:40:04,740
my ass for Mac I was dismissed for
wanting something shiny

731
00:40:04,740 --> 00:40:09,150
or something pretty and business in
words but not when you see also said

732
00:40:09,150 --> 00:40:10,240
jury

733
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:13,990
tonight begin to think maybe what I was
hearing was max are for girls

734
00:40:13,990 --> 00:40:17,990
and when ex's not in because these
computers don't work for you you don't

735
00:40:17,990 --> 00:40:20,700
belong here

736
00:40:20,700 --> 00:40:23,800
but a got a little bit more I don't
think it's just gender I don't think

737
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:27,359
this is that is actually what I was
hearing I think the open-source dogma

738
00:40:27,359 --> 00:40:31,790
the downplays the values that X is more
like a fundamentalist religion Mogan

739
00:40:31,790 --> 00:40:32,609
wants you to be

740
00:40:32,609 --> 00:40:39,060
amish

741
00:40:39,060 --> 00:40:42,230
that's that's Jason Scott Branham
account has those I was told I had been

742
00:40:42,230 --> 00:40:42,760
in

743
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:46,420
and he wants you to not have zippers you
once you wear modest necklines and

744
00:40:46,420 --> 00:40:48,870
sleeves that her down to hear right

745
00:40:48,870 --> 00:40:52,140
because those the next because the
aesthetics a macintosh are the false

746
00:40:52,140 --> 00:40:55,700
inductions a modern world computing that
does not care about your morals

747
00:40:55,700 --> 00:40:58,790
so lemme right

748
00:40:58,790 --> 00:41:02,580
having a region cultural cold is really
good for creating an insular little

749
00:41:02,580 --> 00:41:06,270
religious community right it's not great
for spreading your views the world

750
00:41:06,270 --> 00:41:09,670
one of the most successful things like
Christianity is that it is

751
00:41:09,670 --> 00:41:12,750
flexible right amish sex or not that
flexible them

752
00:41:12,750 --> 00:41:15,890
the majority Christian you leads itself
to go out in the world can be adapted

753
00:41:15,890 --> 00:41:18,020
into all kinds of places right

754
00:41:18,020 --> 00:41:21,410
um the coded that

755
00:41:21,410 --> 00:41:24,970
stahlman and Moblin insist on is
cultural even its its moral

756
00:41:24,970 --> 00:41:27,880
it is very deeply moral their morals the
building is not scientific or

757
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:29,580
objectively true

758
00:41:29,580 --> 00:41:32,630
and I wouldn't mind so much the policing
is the next except that oftentimes they

759
00:41:32,630 --> 00:41:35,740
don't make the distinction between what
is pretty and shiny

760
00:41:35,740 --> 00:41:39,790
and what is usable and most you can put
up with the lack of pretty they cannot

761
00:41:39,790 --> 00:41:40,790
put up we lack

762
00:41:40,790 --> 00:41:45,380
unusable and doing everything from the
command line

763
00:41:45,380 --> 00:41:50,440
I'm so this is what I'm saying solve the
hard problem right what if the hard

764
00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:50,900
problem

765
00:41:50,900 --> 00:41:54,730
isn't cool math problems for physics
problems what if it's really world peace

766
00:41:54,730 --> 00:41:55,900
or world hunger

767
00:41:55,900 --> 00:41:59,460
or resource distribution generally

768
00:41:59,460 --> 00:42:03,420
Comp Sci what if the hard problem isn't
making a better encryption algorithm

769
00:42:03,420 --> 00:42:07,450
but making encryption tools easier to
use and understand this is from

770
00:42:07,450 --> 00:42:11,740
I think a either and Miller GPG as my
fingerprint would be

771
00:42:11,740 --> 00:42:16,400
arm can so much harder than saying this
is my at on Twitter

772
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:19,650
what her problem is making a Linux
distro that works for you

773
00:42:19,650 --> 00:42:23,140
what if it's making a Linux distro never
requires a computer to work from a

774
00:42:23,140 --> 00:42:25,210
command line ever

775
00:42:25,210 --> 00:42:28,440
what if the hard problem is learning to
talk to people you decided a long time

776
00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:34,080
ago want worth your time because the one
smart

777
00:42:34,080 --> 00:42:37,420
okay should not using a maybe not so
good with the people part sometimes

778
00:42:37,420 --> 00:42:38,770
right what do i do looking

779
00:42:38,770 --> 00:42:43,299
I got some suggestions are gone I'm for
small if yards are you deciding whether

780
00:42:43,299 --> 00:42:45,670
you should devote your time to NIS
copper project

781
00:42:45,670 --> 00:42:50,000
first the mall don't make your own new
security tool it will not go as well as

782
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:50,500
you think

783
00:42:50,500 --> 00:42:55,210
mine go to an existing project there are
so many

784
00:42:55,210 --> 00:42:58,350
crypto tools out there that really need
your help on

785
00:42:58,350 --> 00:43:01,690
mill ok is one of my favorites is this
part of the ecosystem where it works

786
00:43:01,690 --> 00:43:02,680
with browser-based

787
00:43:02,680 --> 00:43:07,730
email and we'll sync up to that it's
just easier for people to use and so in

788
00:43:07,730 --> 00:43:09,130
harm reduction model seeing

789
00:43:09,130 --> 00:43:13,000
improving things slightly on mill
workers is a good thing use

790
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:17,799
go home lol on and Mail key passengers
you can also use a developer love

791
00:43:17,799 --> 00:43:21,380
and contribute code specifically makes
things easier for non-technical people

792
00:43:21,380 --> 00:43:22,520
to use

793
00:43:22,520 --> 00:43:25,589
right on this is the commotion projects
are there get herb

794
00:43:25,589 --> 00:43:29,630
repo houses are again had site has a
easily tags on it so you know actually

795
00:43:29,630 --> 00:43:32,510
which things are bugs are usually so you
can actually go and fix them

796
00:43:32,510 --> 00:43:36,130
if you have a project add usability
tags: on to sing like disease believing

797
00:43:36,130 --> 00:43:37,430
then go and fix those

798
00:43:37,430 --> 00:43:41,180
have people have those I'm any include
use researchers and designers on your

799
00:43:41,180 --> 00:43:43,120
team is your developing software

800
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:46,700
work with them to when you make a new
app per site

801
00:43:46,700 --> 00:43:52,100
maybe even your good but just don't tell
mama don't let them tell you focus group

802
00:43:52,100 --> 00:43:53,350
is for those considering

803
00:43:53,350 --> 00:43:56,210
you can I mean now that you've been to
stalk you can be like to talk about good

804
00:43:56,210 --> 00:43:59,660
methods for finding things about people
right seems we're working on that

805
00:43:59,660 --> 00:44:03,480
we're not qualitative methods and which
ones are good for which questions

806
00:44:03,480 --> 00:44:09,020
on I like a yep mills in zoeller box
it's not all qualitative

807
00:44:09,020 --> 00:44:12,640
is not a good stuff in there and look a
little bit more and ethnography in

808
00:44:12,640 --> 00:44:16,049
than whites Palin why does what does and
at methodology

809
00:44:16,049 --> 00:44:20,170
on a really basic human level get better
at asking questions about the people

810
00:44:20,170 --> 00:44:24,510
right on known again do you encrypt your
messages

811
00:44:24,510 --> 00:44:28,450
what is the the implicit assumption
question do you encrypt your messages

812
00:44:28,450 --> 00:44:33,150
the no encryption is what else but you
should read to break the big one right

813
00:44:33,150 --> 00:44:33,839
there so

814
00:44:33,839 --> 00:44:37,280
that's kinda close and it was this one
questions like how long you been beating

815
00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:39,690
your wife fred was a very leading
question

816
00:44:39,690 --> 00:44:43,490
on askin said something like what do you
do to keep your communication Saving

817
00:44:43,490 --> 00:44:45,930
Private people already have practice is
that they're using

818
00:44:45,930 --> 00:44:49,350
and if you can bill liners and support
those more and then

819
00:44:49,350 --> 00:44:52,790
go that extra mile in getting given all
the more support to do better crypto

820
00:44:52,790 --> 00:44:58,010
good arm yes we're asking non leading
open and questions a good way to get

821
00:44:58,010 --> 00:45:02,100
people to tell you more about themselves
generally all subsequent getting a

822
00:45:02,100 --> 00:45:05,850
particular community users are like
Muslims in the US are LGBT activists and

823
00:45:05,850 --> 00:45:06,280
Russian

824
00:45:06,280 --> 00:45:10,569
I seen here and help ensure that their
needs are heard and saw for development

825
00:45:10,569 --> 00:45:14,160
on LGBT communities have really really
interesting needs in terms of privacy

826
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:15,190
and security

827
00:45:15,190 --> 00:45:18,650
there's a real need to speak out right
and now I'm hearing from people who work

828
00:45:18,650 --> 00:45:20,299
with LGBT activists in Russia

829
00:45:20,299 --> 00:45:23,260
that they're like they don't want to
hide they don't want to encrypt things

830
00:45:23,260 --> 00:45:25,680
they don't want to get away but at the
same time they do need to manage their

831
00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:26,670
physical safety

832
00:45:26,670 --> 00:45:29,870
people need to not know where they are
at particular point in time so speech

833
00:45:29,870 --> 00:45:32,530
needs to get out and the need to protect
their physical person

834
00:45:32,530 --> 00:45:36,770
which is different than for example a
people wonderful surveillance in China

835
00:45:36,770 --> 00:45:41,180
very different kind among generally talk
to people who aren't like you and ask

836
00:45:41,180 --> 00:45:43,930
them what they need software to do

837
00:45:43,930 --> 00:45:48,580
thank you and now we have five minutes
for questions

838
00:45:48,580 --> 00:45:53,380
good time

839
00:45:53,380 --> 00:45:57,720
amazingly I don't feel sick anymore yes
anybody

840
00:45:57,720 --> 00:46:02,049
when oh and sexually sorry people are
supposed to go to the microphones are

841
00:46:02,049 --> 00:46:02,480
now

842
00:46:02,480 --> 00:46:07,230
now it's gone as in like manner but go
ahead for now

843
00:46:07,230 --> 00:46:11,279
year

844
00:46:11,279 --> 00:46:16,840
in

845
00:46:16,840 --> 00:46:17,380
totes

846
00:46:17,380 --> 00:46:21,690
your deepest apology cook until he went
oh yes aria is worth

847
00:46:21,690 --> 00:46:24,810
splitting the the chart in tears in eyes
and rental monroe's

848
00:46:24,810 --> 00:46:28,000
in the two axes one about the
methodology and what about the subject

849
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,880
I think that's a really good idea
particularly given that like more and

850
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:32,050
more what we do in life

851
00:46:32,050 --> 00:46:36,100
is our multi-disciplinary and so and
Methods really do travel i cant

852
00:46:36,100 --> 00:46:37,640
apologists will do

853
00:46:37,640 --> 00:46:41,310
people do surveys will do a quantity
discount so the community

854
00:46:41,310 --> 00:46:44,620
and answers ya just what to do if not a
few to observe things so

855
00:46:44,620 --> 00:46:48,940
yeah on I think just sorta identify
methods and taking across from place to

856
00:46:48,940 --> 00:46:49,870
place is really gonna get

857
00:46:49,870 --> 00:46:54,220
so yes here next to him there not gonna
happen

858
00:46:54,220 --> 00:47:01,220
mom

859
00:47:03,719 --> 00:47:05,969
we am

860
00:47:05,969 --> 00:47:12,969
in

861
00:47:16,559 --> 00:47:22,020
mmm

862
00:47:22,020 --> 00:47:25,579
home

863
00:47:25,579 --> 00:47:28,430
mmm

864
00:47:28,430 --> 00:47:33,460
home

865
00:47:33,460 --> 00:47:36,570
home

866
00:47:36,570 --> 00:47:40,619
right for yes the comment was is the the
great point about

867
00:47:40,619 --> 00:47:44,609
disabilities ability and how hard it is
to get those standards adopted every

868
00:47:44,609 --> 00:47:47,560
words it's very very important sector
important as much practice communities

869
00:47:47,560 --> 00:47:48,580
anybody else cuz

870
00:47:48,580 --> 00:47:53,890
on disabled person as communities well
so yen is it is a major challenge on we

871
00:47:53,890 --> 00:47:55,780
we're having these discussions across

872
00:47:55,780 --> 00:48:00,650
encryption technologies and even we have
discussions you can't necessarily get

873
00:48:00,650 --> 00:48:03,359
everybody on the same page and that is
yes really hard problem

874
00:48:03,359 --> 00:48:08,260
on 10 my major suggestions for anybody
to learning about social changes read

875
00:48:08,260 --> 00:48:09,700
every Rogers's

876
00:48:09,700 --> 00:48:13,010
diffusion of innovations which is a
massive compendium

877
00:48:13,010 --> 00:48:16,290
all the social change researchers ever
been done it's basically the book that

878
00:48:16,290 --> 00:48:17,690
Malcolm Gladwell stole from

879
00:48:17,690 --> 00:48:21,609
in words right to pinpoint an and so on

880
00:48:21,609 --> 00:48:25,270
it's useful in thinking about how change
happens how people adopt things

881
00:48:25,270 --> 00:48:28,300
who adopts first and what kinda message
need to happen so

882
00:48:28,300 --> 00:48:35,300
that's a big recommendation for me yes
up

883
00:48:38,160 --> 00:48:45,160
on what comes after projects have good
usability specifically liquid

884
00:48:45,480 --> 00:48:49,049
have a good process for these things um
I think the

885
00:48:49,049 --> 00:48:52,049
the teams and I'm thinking of the do
really well commotion actually is doing

886
00:48:52,049 --> 00:48:53,829
a really good job other documentation

887
00:48:53,829 --> 00:48:58,760
on their own wireless mesh networking
software and the whisper systems team is

888
00:48:58,760 --> 00:49:01,789
doing a lot of work like i said im was
reasonably planet said we're going to a

889
00:49:01,789 --> 00:49:03,260
local community center Mike

890
00:49:03,260 --> 00:49:06,619
good job because you're finding people
who are really not like you and thats

891
00:49:06,619 --> 00:49:09,890
there the Bay Area so that's really
particularly hard because it's just

892
00:49:09,890 --> 00:49:13,930
gender by so much you can't find people
who are not seem educational background

893
00:49:13,930 --> 00:49:16,950
view maybe a different culture than you
know things like that so their project

894
00:49:16,950 --> 00:49:18,410
is good and i know im forgetting

895
00:49:18,410 --> 00:49:23,339
I'll a Guardian project im has a large
team that's doing a lot of integrating

896
00:49:23,339 --> 00:49:24,599
usability work

897
00:49:24,599 --> 00:49:28,440
from the beginning arm and mmm

898
00:49:28,440 --> 00:49:31,480
you 1 I'm thinking a good look at good
to Canton team here

899
00:49:31,480 --> 00:49:35,250
go crypto can occur to cut some known
for being pretty sleek and his mom

900
00:49:35,250 --> 00:49:42,250
some on them

901
00:49:42,519 --> 00:49:46,920
if they won

902
00:49:46,920 --> 00:49:51,109
yes wouldn't usability be term problem
be solved if there is market demand for

903
00:49:51,109 --> 00:49:52,029
these tools

904
00:49:52,029 --> 00:49:56,579
yes it would and as a matter fact I
think we're kind of scene in that didn't

905
00:49:56,579 --> 00:49:58,000
google recently

906
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:02,250
google recently did mean some adjustment
that made crypto easier for everyone was

907
00:50:02,250 --> 00:50:02,730
email

908
00:50:02,730 --> 00:50:06,029
or something like that is like something
and so yeah I mean like

909
00:50:06,029 --> 00:50:10,819
to mean I'm speaking not for my job in
all speaking entirely personally I think

910
00:50:10,819 --> 00:50:13,849
the best thing we could do would be
protocols rightly get all others in the

911
00:50:13,849 --> 00:50:17,299
protocol on some people never ever ever
ever ever have to listen to it

912
00:50:17,299 --> 00:50:21,089
are a deal then but once again that is a
social problem because and has the same

913
00:50:21,089 --> 00:50:22,109
problem a farm

914
00:50:22,109 --> 00:50:26,019
we have a disability usability and is
getting everybody on the same page the

915
00:50:26,019 --> 00:50:28,500
protocols and there will be corporate
interests that will have particular

916
00:50:28,500 --> 00:50:30,839
takes on how to go and there'll be

917
00:50:30,839 --> 00:50:35,670
you know other small group am it's hard
to get adoption there but that is it

918
00:50:35,670 --> 00:50:38,569
certainly if you if you feel like
there's something you should do and I'm

919
00:50:38,569 --> 00:50:41,019
you're feeling by doing suffer project
get involved maybe in helping people

920
00:50:41,019 --> 00:50:43,640
adopt new standards cuz I think that
might be a way to go to

921
00:50:43,640 --> 00:50:46,779
some I'm told I'm a time thank you all
very much

922
00:50:46,779 --> 00:50:51,349
