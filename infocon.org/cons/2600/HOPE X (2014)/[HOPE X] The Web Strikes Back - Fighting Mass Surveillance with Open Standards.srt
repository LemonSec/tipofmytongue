1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:05,680
okay so I think if one thing that people
often forget so how many people heard

2
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:06,310
over the

3
00:00:06,310 --> 00:00:11,150
you broke the Internet I initiative
president is completely broken and we

4
00:00:11,150 --> 00:00:12,500
should create a new one

5
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:15,860
that peer to peer really nice and and
stuff

6
00:00:15,860 --> 00:00:20,340
I and and I agree that would be great it
would be great if we had

7
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:23,470
a a new internet was to have all over
the

8
00:00:23,470 --> 00:00:27,109
up legacy problems that we have a dinner
and the web today

9
00:00:27,109 --> 00:00:31,939
unfortunately we have I'll you know
millions billions of people

10
00:00:31,939 --> 00:00:37,739
on the Internet and Web and I don't know
that many people on alternative systems

11
00:00:37,739 --> 00:00:38,500
right now

12
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:41,870
really i mean so territories huge we're
still talking

13
00:00:41,870 --> 00:00:46,140
you know half-million millions for users
and we have

14
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:49,539
many many more people who use order
ordinary Internet

15
00:00:49,539 --> 00:00:53,390
and I I kinda feel like you have a sore

16
00:00:53,390 --> 00:00:57,800
full of appears to hackers or say I'm
gonna build a completely different

17
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:01,460
any reference to use it and maybe I'll
take off you know that does work

18
00:01:01,460 --> 00:01:03,399
sometime that is actually

19
00:01:03,399 --> 00:01:06,880
how the weather happen and so it would
be really cool that happen

20
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:10,810
or you take another route answer say
we're gonna look at the existing

21
00:01:10,810 --> 00:01:13,970
affectively up mess we have today

22
00:01:13,970 --> 00:01:19,080
and try to fix as much as we can as a
way to look at the latter path and the

23
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:20,430
fact about it on the web

24
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:25,689
are actually I'm which is a bit Americal
they are open platforms in so far as

25
00:01:25,689 --> 00:01:26,110
that

26
00:01:26,110 --> 00:01:30,280
anyone I including random people over
mailing list can effectively

27
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:34,290
I joy pain a a working group and
contribute

28
00:01:34,290 --> 00:01:37,409
to the open standards that create

29
00:01:37,409 --> 00:01:41,060
that define the Internet and Web and
that's the

30
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:45,159
I'll that's our thing I like to remind
people then and whether it is not just

31
00:01:45,159 --> 00:01:46,369
offers not just harder

32
00:01:46,369 --> 00:01:50,009
its actually defined on abstract level

33
00:01:50,009 --> 00:01:53,070
a protocol some people moors of for
example

34
00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:57,000
I will source a billionaire doesn't
really exist you just have facebook if

35
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:57,820
all these different app

36
00:01:57,820 --> 00:02:01,030
actually you know they're is effectively

37
00:02:01,030 --> 00:02:05,460
a fairly singular set of protocols that
the find these environments rights or

38
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:05,939
something

39
00:02:05,939 --> 00:02:09,750
doesn't speak TCI be not on the internet
if something's not speaking

40
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:13,190
a virgin HDPE in your eyes it's not on
the web

41
00:02:13,190 --> 00:02:16,800
and people who don't understand that to
be honest like Moore's of I think our

42
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:20,780
idiots we actually need educate people
about the importance

43
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:25,970
open standards because the fact that
matters part of the reason why we got

44
00:02:25,970 --> 00:02:29,099
in this mess today outlook for basis
rails

45
00:02:29,099 --> 00:02:32,129
is effectively the state up but nine
neglect

46
00:02:32,129 --> 00:02:35,330
arm that many people had

47
00:02:35,330 --> 00:02:40,019
as regards the architectural plumbing
other web internet themselves

48
00:02:40,019 --> 00:02:44,150
very few people were taking active
stewardship

49
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:47,450
up these protocols effectively leaving
them

50
00:02:47,450 --> 00:02:52,360
to standards bodies which to be honest
need your help so that's why I'm giving

51
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:54,489
this talk today because we actually need

52
00:02:54,489 --> 00:02:59,830
more people who really concerned about
security concern about privacy concerns

53
00:02:59,830 --> 00:03:00,349
about

54
00:03:00,349 --> 00:03:03,800
surveilled concern about freedom to get
involved

55
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:07,360
into this process because right now it's
a lot of work there's not enough people

56
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:08,040
doing it

57
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:12,599
so I'll in all

58
00:03:12,599 --> 00:03:16,879
I just wanted to mention one thing um
and also beautiful things change really

59
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:17,610
fast

60
00:03:17,610 --> 00:03:21,930
%uh actually you know to be frankly
don't most other original concept

61
00:03:21,930 --> 00:03:25,379
you know in the web and their idea they
were ground for the second on the

62
00:03:25,379 --> 00:03:26,879
internet had some like a blog

63
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:30,610
it was in vision by the closing the bar
in the fifties as a way to solve

64
00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:34,019
large-scale global problems we have also
prompted we need

65
00:03:34,019 --> 00:03:37,840
a trusted and secure Internet to solve
those problems

66
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:41,890
however um and what people forget also
what you think

67
00:03:41,890 --> 00:03:45,930
really has to be emphasized is how many
people here participated

68
00:03:45,930 --> 00:03:51,909
internet Engineering Task Force working
group not a single one is that bad

69
00:03:51,909 --> 00:03:55,849
stuff about it is that bad not a single
person

70
00:03:55,849 --> 00:04:00,319
as ever email the IIHF okay so so often
people say why

71
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:05,489
yeah I just let us talk at black hat and
I'll TLS is such a disaster why still a

72
00:04:05,489 --> 00:04:06,629
such as asteroids

73
00:04:06,629 --> 00:04:10,409
why don't browsers do better certificate
pending what is a typical pending how

74
00:04:10,409 --> 00:04:11,530
how can we make sure

75
00:04:11,530 --> 00:04:16,180
that when I talk 21 issue server in
point I'm a client I actually verify the

76
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:18,060
connection ever using good crypto

77
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:21,859
and we don't have up so all sorts of
problems that have become very why I

78
00:04:21,859 --> 00:04:25,990
more widely known today in and upper and
an actually what you discover

79
00:04:25,990 --> 00:04:29,160
is that the core fundamentals up

80
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:32,259
up the Internet such as the less are
effectively ran

81
00:04:32,259 --> 00:04:36,930
I am by groups of volunteers I you're
somewhat soft lighting some people

82
00:04:36,930 --> 00:04:38,440
working there for companies

83
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:42,570
and in the run-up open I'm
consensus-based process

84
00:04:42,570 --> 00:04:46,380
which is sort of crazy to think about as
its it's a global consensus based

85
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:47,479
process

86
00:04:47,479 --> 00:04:50,860
and then affectively anyone

87
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:54,479
particular the IETF can join in this
comes from the unique

88
00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:58,840
history on the Internet as essentially
it was a research project and Grace Lee

89
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:00,780
graduate students

90
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:05,289
you know got involved and at when
they're defined the protocols a software

91
00:05:05,289 --> 00:05:05,699
because

92
00:05:05,699 --> 00:05:09,860
the military the research units on paper
the hardware they found what were called

93
00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:13,830
RFC to people know what archie Zardari
have I gave us a request for okay

94
00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:18,250
X like I was getting worried her have so
I'm glad people still actually

95
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:21,590
read RC's so the fact that matters
anyone

96
00:05:21,590 --> 00:05:24,940
including you could sit down and look at
something

97
00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:28,240
you know I know for example toward as
the eye could create

98
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:33,190
and information RC and suggest this an
ego say I would create an informational

99
00:05:33,190 --> 00:05:37,479
RCI action should be a standard and it
goes as processor wide spread open

100
00:05:37,479 --> 00:05:38,360
review

101
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:41,800
venture a guess at the Internet
architecture boards takes a few years

102
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:46,430
gives a quite thorough review with
either approved or denied

103
00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:50,350
and the web I'm of people ask what is
the relation between the World Wide Web

104
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:51,310
Consortium

105
00:05:51,310 --> 00:05:55,080
and the Internet while the weather is an
application that runs on top of the

106
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:55,889
Internet

107
00:05:55,889 --> 00:05:59,120
I so the internet of course is everyone
here probably knows

108
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:03,610
existed way before I am

109
00:06:03,610 --> 00:06:07,710
the web and and that the web may not
last we don't know but

110
00:06:07,710 --> 00:06:11,460
the fact im as when the wedge targeting
really big a lot of

111
00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:14,539
a large companies large players got star
gave up the idea

112
00:06:14,539 --> 00:06:18,750
in IETF on is a much more loose informal
process

113
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:22,360
and so basically 10 berners-lee in order
to sort defend the open web for being

114
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:25,610
taken over by a single company I believe
the problem time

115
00:06:25,610 --> 00:06:29,870
where netscape and microsoft business or
said hey we're gonna create a standards

116
00:06:29,870 --> 00:06:30,530
body

117
00:06:30,530 --> 00:06:34,100
which is a consortium which is more
structured then I TF

118
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:37,509
to handle just the web facing layers and
that's the

119
00:06:37,509 --> 00:06:42,850
World Wide Web Consortium now I am why a
consortium that sounds very exclusionary

120
00:06:42,850 --> 00:06:48,069
well what may the word open everyone
throws around ok i'm open source open

121
00:06:48,069 --> 00:06:48,919
standards

122
00:06:48,919 --> 00:06:53,360
what is open mean the w3c actually has a
pretty good definition

123
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:56,819
open watch comes from the fact its
consortium

124
00:06:56,819 --> 00:07:01,470
so even if you're making open source you
or possibly liable

125
00:07:01,470 --> 00:07:05,380
for licensing fees from software patents
the US offer patent system is completely

126
00:07:05,380 --> 00:07:06,599
broken

127
00:07:06,599 --> 00:07:11,270
and and his exit exceptionally arm

128
00:07:11,270 --> 00:07:14,940
all rife what crazy software patents

129
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:18,880
so effectively I'm a consortium utmost
that the large companies were

130
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:22,479
currently running three hundred some
companies I'm including most cellco

131
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:23,099
Valley

132
00:07:23,099 --> 00:07:28,190
IBM Google eccentric Center ending the
newer ones like Facebook and Twitter

133
00:07:28,190 --> 00:07:31,560
all those patterns are gathered together
and they make what is effectively a

134
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:33,110
large patent war chess

135
00:07:33,110 --> 00:07:36,819
and so if you say hey I'm a patent role
I have a

136
00:07:36,819 --> 00:07:41,020
patted on a shadow of a pattern on
crypto JavaScript

137
00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:44,050
or up what could happen is that the v3
seek answers a

138
00:07:44,050 --> 00:07:47,229
actually we have a giant patent war
chest up at commits from

139
00:07:47,229 --> 00:07:52,460
major companies to HTML and if you want
to go up against us and IBM's lawyers

140
00:07:52,460 --> 00:07:54,379
and it was lawyers go for it buddy

141
00:07:54,379 --> 00:07:57,940
and that actually basically provides a
large map safety

142
00:07:57,940 --> 00:08:02,050
order developers that's the important
connection between open standards open

143
00:08:02,050 --> 00:08:02,819
source

144
00:08:02,819 --> 00:08:06,160
that will open source affectively deals
I

145
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:09,240
you know level the source code we a

146
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:12,770
with specification still level the
software process the more abstract level

147
00:08:12,770 --> 00:08:15,889
commitment open source telephony and
proprietary code

148
00:08:15,889 --> 00:08:19,990
and the consortium has structure to
defend against passage however

149
00:08:19,990 --> 00:08:24,960
the consortium is open for all sort of
-ism participation usually have to email

150
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:28,319
the working group chair the invite an
expert and they

151
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:31,840
well basically give used as it was
called and invited

152
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:35,089
expert so a question is

153
00:08:35,089 --> 00:08:39,190
with our web consortium is we bases are
working group and

154
00:08:39,190 --> 00:08:42,839
how to fill you up to speed at w3c
Working Group

155
00:08:42,839 --> 00:08:46,010
1x so better than I G A

156
00:08:46,010 --> 00:08:49,399
had a so so that the the w3c basically

157
00:08:49,399 --> 00:08:52,680
how we work it how we make standards
respectively

158
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:55,720
mailing list IRC

159
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:58,890
and depending on how your group goes

160
00:08:58,890 --> 00:09:03,160
Telecom's and bug tracking huge by Jill
lawless

161
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:07,080
it so effectively if you can participate
any others mediums

162
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:11,279
you could actually track though often
quite heavy our conversation going on

163
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:14,830
it's very easy to get involved and the
b3 seek starts working group

164
00:09:14,830 --> 00:09:15,950
particularly

165
00:09:15,950 --> 00:09:20,100
places which we view as crucial to the
future the web so you know for many

166
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:21,390
years there is excitement

167
00:09:21,390 --> 00:09:24,610
XML in a lot of work force graphics

168
00:09:24,610 --> 00:09:28,260
and the where the web has perhaps been
weakest

169
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:32,019
is as everyone here I was his intimately
familiar what

170
00:09:32,019 --> 00:09:37,190
web security I and that's what we're
trying to fix

171
00:09:37,190 --> 00:09:40,459
so arm that another difference with is

172
00:09:40,459 --> 00:09:45,870
the our seas are all ASCII all that the
3 C's HTML because obviously

173
00:09:45,870 --> 00:09:51,820
with me I'll be around I am but what are
the concerns we have in standards bodies

174
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:52,300
is that

175
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:55,399
as long as is only a very small

176
00:09:55,399 --> 00:09:59,500
number people so really involved they
serve on Terry processors and

177
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:02,610
all them people paid by their employers
to be involved

178
00:10:02,610 --> 00:10:05,839
it's actually quite easy or at least
let's say

179
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:09,410
plausible to manipulate the process so
we know that

180
00:10:09,410 --> 00:10:12,610
a project Bull Run had a segment of it
was due

181
00:10:12,610 --> 00:10:16,720
actually influence I standards bodies to
produce standards

182
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:19,950
which are more amenable to whatever the
NSA's goals were

183
00:10:19,950 --> 00:10:23,700
this a very large budget no $250 million
dollars the w3c

184
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:27,980
whole operating budget is the ground ten
million dollars so

185
00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:31,860
so it is actually very small I could
have bought us I guess but they did it

186
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:35,610
I a while we don't any evidence that the

187
00:10:35,610 --> 00:10:38,959
that the w3c itself

188
00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:43,410
has been manipulated arm you know we
there's been a lot a controversy going

189
00:10:43,410 --> 00:10:44,890
on in the IETF

190
00:10:44,890 --> 00:10:48,390
want the coach airs the International
Paper research for

191
00:10:48,390 --> 00:10:52,990
work for the NSA and this is of course
called out and discussed and

192
00:10:52,990 --> 00:10:57,829
systole the coach air but you know it's
by Trevor parent among others

193
00:10:57,829 --> 00:11:01,620
I we do have a number places where we
have

194
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:07,860
good evidence I a hundred solve it to us
all that that you should be suspicious

195
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:11,670
that back doors have possibly been put
in at least this is a random number

196
00:11:11,670 --> 00:11:13,720
generators record by minus

197
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:17,290
and that miss the National Institute for
Standards the US

198
00:11:17,290 --> 00:11:22,310
because it doesn't have a cryptographic
expertise does often recommend the pram

199
00:11:22,310 --> 00:11:24,890
majors will go into this Web tripped on
a second

200
00:11:24,890 --> 00:11:28,290
I used by various algorithms

201
00:11:28,290 --> 00:11:31,649
and this is becoming much more earlier
because

202
00:11:31,649 --> 00:11:35,060
America was viewed as Chevy Suburban
online

203
00:11:35,060 --> 00:11:39,240
and neglectful role towards Internet
Governance

204
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:44,040
on and missed you know the problem this
heads were both of incident defense's

205
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:47,529
or rules sometimes you wont get security
standards

206
00:11:47,529 --> 00:11:52,060
internally and your enemies that weak
ones so therefore people so are highly

207
00:11:52,060 --> 00:11:55,110
I would say more trust inist

208
00:11:55,110 --> 00:11:59,190
that they had before I after the Sun
revelations

209
00:11:59,190 --> 00:12:02,250
at the central issues did reveal that
essay was me playing

210
00:12:02,250 --> 00:12:06,209
this and some circumstances and now the
spin recognition from the White House

211
00:12:06,209 --> 00:12:07,459
much others do

212
00:12:07,459 --> 00:12:11,630
get that back in order it's still outfit
a concerning the question is how do you

213
00:12:11,630 --> 00:12:12,560
detect that

214
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:16,300
well you detect that be open processes
we have lots of people involved because

215
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:17,740
more people look at something

216
00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:21,209
the more likely you are to you discover
the back door if you

217
00:12:21,209 --> 00:12:24,740
basic cooking up your standard be in a
close industry consortium

218
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:28,350
no one will know if mister anyone else

219
00:12:28,350 --> 00:12:31,480
has manipulated your crypto

220
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:35,230
arm so what's been happening which has
been sort interesting

221
00:12:35,230 --> 00:12:39,060
is post stun revelations there was love

222
00:12:39,060 --> 00:12:44,250
outcry I'm by the engineers so most of
the standards bodies are not ran by

223
00:12:44,250 --> 00:12:45,579
particularly

224
00:12:45,579 --> 00:12:48,680
I would say a high-level types the the
most dissipation

225
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:53,040
comes from people who are implementers
or I would say at least

226
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:56,130
engineers with a high interest
implementation

227
00:12:56,130 --> 00:13:01,060
in various organizations and they were
was your quite shocked

228
00:13:01,060 --> 00:13:04,940
when some revelations came out you know
Tim berners-lee the

229
00:13:04,940 --> 00:13:08,060
director the Web Consortium and I better

230
00:13:08,060 --> 00:13:11,680
the wet basis so that he felt that
snowed in you know as a hero

231
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:15,519
should be protected and that there is
generally

232
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:19,050
a lot of internal review start happening
looking at what standards that we

233
00:13:19,050 --> 00:13:21,850
produce with it could have been
influence

234
00:13:21,850 --> 00:13:25,149
and that the most important thing is
that for all future standards

235
00:13:25,149 --> 00:13:27,040
Engineering Task Force

236
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:30,089
has basically decided that of that
should be should be

237
00:13:30,089 --> 00:13:33,750
pervasive surveillance which is some
sort global passive adversary which can

238
00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:34,630
basically

239
00:13:34,630 --> 00:13:37,720
monitor all ends at the communication
network

240
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:41,120
should be taken as a serious
considerations are just as we have

241
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:45,329
in most nicest their security and
privacy organs considerations

242
00:13:45,329 --> 00:13:49,220
we should have considerations around
pervasive surveillance

243
00:13:49,220 --> 00:13:53,339
and your interest in this discussion the
IETF has discussion pair pass

244
00:13:53,339 --> 00:13:56,670
which is up pervasive surveillance
mailing list

245
00:13:56,670 --> 00:14:00,510
and there's a lot of other discussion
going on

246
00:14:00,510 --> 00:14:04,660
I may give you more about what the w3c
doing cuz that's who I work for an

247
00:14:04,660 --> 00:14:06,980
engineering task force has been

248
00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:11,040
very up front w3c still sore working on
our game plan

249
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:14,269
for this area so we did host a workshop
and

250
00:14:14,269 --> 00:14:18,930
in March which you can look at you want
to know what we're thinking about we

251
00:14:18,930 --> 00:14:22,860
right and make public offer logs and
we're searching for what can we as the B

252
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:23,899
three C

253
00:14:23,899 --> 00:14:27,269
do to basically help combat pervasive

254
00:14:27,269 --> 00:14:30,839
surveillance and there's a lot of
problems so

255
00:14:30,839 --> 00:14:34,389
I'm some other outside of our control
one of the larger problem course

256
00:14:34,389 --> 00:14:39,310
is the problem certificates right so
your certificate management certificates

257
00:14:39,310 --> 00:14:44,820
I basically you know if there's not a
heart there is not a heart fail for

258
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:46,610
certificates the certificate system

259
00:14:46,610 --> 00:14:50,149
is has is ridiculous attack surface
which measly compromise

260
00:14:50,149 --> 00:14:53,889
a lot out of our control that's the
hands up Privett

261
00:14:53,889 --> 00:14:57,410
close industrial consortiums like this
certificate

262
00:14:57,410 --> 00:15:01,699
browser CA for I but

263
00:15:01,699 --> 00:15:04,930
at the same point are some things you
thought for new standards which should

264
00:15:04,930 --> 00:15:05,220
take

265
00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:09,610
should take into account a previously in
general we have not taken into account

266
00:15:09,610 --> 00:15:13,370
data minimisation principles I we have
not taken into account

267
00:15:13,370 --> 00:15:17,560
ever traffic analysis and ever and of
course you know although

268
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:21,600
the situation is pretty disparity right
now around browser fingerprinting

269
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:25,170
we are trying to at least haiti's into
account

270
00:15:25,170 --> 00:15:29,050
and in too few in future standards and
there are

271
00:15:29,050 --> 00:15:33,230
a large amounts profit I I want with you
in detail but effectively

272
00:15:33,230 --> 00:15:36,810
the the web security model is is well
known

273
00:15:36,810 --> 00:15:41,180
arm to be broken very simple simple
things like parsing your eyes

274
00:15:41,180 --> 00:15:45,769
crossers web browsers aren't are not
completely standardize an awesome for

275
00:15:45,769 --> 00:15:47,389
been very interesting

276
00:15:47,389 --> 00:15:51,880
attack services so there's tons of stuff
going on my list quite a few them there

277
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:55,019
it all sorts of different working groups
I'm going to concentrate

278
00:15:55,019 --> 00:15:58,040
on the ones that I'm working at so the

279
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:01,279
working group to I'm most evolved worth
I'll

280
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:04,990
and help start was the web.config
working group so we noticed

281
00:16:04,990 --> 00:16:09,779
this or disturbing phenomenon I am where
effectively a lot of people

282
00:16:09,779 --> 00:16:13,480
wanted to do crypto in javascript and
there were there really often very

283
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:14,959
well-meaning people

284
00:16:14,959 --> 00:16:18,949
I'm the in the fact the matters that's
over its in general

285
00:16:18,949 --> 00:16:22,199
particularly few years ago a very bad
idea still

286
00:16:22,199 --> 00:16:26,380
of about it here but we're getting a
little better at least we understand

287
00:16:26,380 --> 00:16:30,089
the problem and have some good things we
can offer you although not enough

288
00:16:30,089 --> 00:16:33,220
so effectively the issue is even if I
want to do

289
00:16:33,220 --> 00:16:37,149
any crypto JavaScript I visit the call
some service ie live here after all to

290
00:16:37,149 --> 00:16:38,889
retrieve the lobby for a server

291
00:16:38,889 --> 00:16:43,029
yet the you basically have to you get
you trust never that code is

292
00:16:43,029 --> 00:16:46,410
occurred often has not been I very

293
00:16:46,410 --> 00:16:49,600
very well love you to look at OpenPGP
.gs

294
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:53,779
and and and and well-meaning web
developers this came out what I believe

295
00:16:53,779 --> 00:16:57,820
crypto cat has come up much more
recently with proton mail it was even

296
00:16:57,820 --> 00:17:03,139
strangely enough mentioned I am by
ladder and arc welders is real desire to

297
00:17:03,139 --> 00:17:06,350
do things that provide Indian encryption

298
00:17:06,350 --> 00:17:09,539
in I JavaScript which

299
00:17:09,539 --> 00:17:13,079
is at least without a browser plugin

300
00:17:13,079 --> 00:17:17,819
a terrible idea it just does not work
because you cannot basically but for the

301
00:17:17,819 --> 00:17:19,280
private key

302
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:22,929
from the server and furthermore your
career graphic routines

303
00:17:22,929 --> 00:17:25,780
you know they're not necessarily well
verify they're not cause the time

304
00:17:25,780 --> 00:17:27,630
there's all sorts of problems there

305
00:17:27,630 --> 00:17:32,070
as we basically don't want people to
create and and I can't help it

306
00:17:32,070 --> 00:17:37,150
advertising or just idiocy are something
like proton mail which basically means

307
00:17:37,150 --> 00:17:38,230
to be an end

308
00:17:38,230 --> 00:17:41,570
cryptid email service which actually is
it because i jus runs

309
00:17:41,570 --> 00:17:45,910
in the browser runtime: you can't do
that for a very principled reasons

310
00:17:45,910 --> 00:17:49,850
we would eventually like to get to the
point with that is possible but that's a

311
00:17:49,850 --> 00:17:51,799
long road I'm going to walk through

312
00:17:51,799 --> 00:17:56,070
what progress we've made more progress
we have it so

313
00:17:56,070 --> 00:17:59,910
arm what we did we did create

314
00:17:59,910 --> 00:18:05,000
a jobs for went for Tiger papi just
google for look at the API an API

315
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:08,230
offers all the features that one word

316
00:18:08,230 --> 00:18:11,780
wont out I love affectively JavaScript
web crypto

317
00:18:11,780 --> 00:18:15,299
however it is %uh so basically it's

318
00:18:15,299 --> 00:18:18,780
a synchronous which is great so use
promises

319
00:18:18,780 --> 00:18:22,120
which allows so but you don't want when
you're ready just where provisional on

320
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:23,900
to start generating key

321
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:27,500
that jam up all the rest up your jobs

322
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:30,860
JavaScript code it does offer

323
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:35,380
%uh mmm probably too many cryptographic
primitives is a bitter debate over this

324
00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:39,620
but we do crips anti-corruption ECC arce
all the classic stuff

325
00:18:39,620 --> 00:18:42,860
all the hash is that you could how such
as you possibly wanna clean ones that

326
00:18:42,860 --> 00:18:43,750
people

327
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:47,740
I'm you know don't like and some which
are clearly broken by Shaw 1

328
00:18:47,740 --> 00:18:51,770
but we do give all this to you and you
wanted to be sore concert I'm

329
00:18:51,770 --> 00:18:55,130
the problem is we do not on

330
00:18:55,130 --> 00:18:58,370
we realize that this API effectively

331
00:18:58,370 --> 00:19:02,320
is gonna be used we think at least in
this version by people who

332
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:06,150
on who are basic trying to code up some
so protocol

333
00:19:06,150 --> 00:19:09,200
and the in the they can follow the
instructions

334
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:13,370
the understand their security models but
we're we're not track rate in this

335
00:19:13,370 --> 00:19:14,650
version: API

336
00:19:14,650 --> 00:19:18,309
is API for in developers who who don't
know what they're doing

337
00:19:18,309 --> 00:19:22,320
just want some quick level security we
would like to do that

338
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:25,299
the problems that's very protocol
Pacific so we saw record them as

339
00:19:25,299 --> 00:19:26,559
general-purpose one

340
00:19:26,559 --> 00:19:30,400
week and the beginning and more higher
level abstract ones

341
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:33,440
could be created afterwards by
essentially

342
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:37,760
at first poly filling in later building
on top the market he said way and maybe

343
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:38,799
a second version

344
00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:42,820
up the spec that's called the high-level
API

345
00:19:42,820 --> 00:19:46,799
are but we have a number open issues so

346
00:19:46,799 --> 00:19:50,500
love the open issues is so how

347
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:53,809
the b3 she works as we create a draft
back

348
00:19:53,809 --> 00:19:58,280
what the implementers involved what
larger crowd of a look at a bad about me

349
00:19:58,280 --> 00:19:59,090
know

350
00:19:59,090 --> 00:20:02,440
ritual about 50 people in the room in
its kinda died down a bit

351
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:06,309
but right now you have all the major
browser vendors involved

352
00:20:06,309 --> 00:20:09,460
and one thing that developers want as
developer war

353
00:20:09,460 --> 00:20:14,309
developers want burns teens EC seeker so
curfew 5519

354
00:20:14,309 --> 00:20:17,320
is considered you know more trustworthy

355
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:20,549
then be missed provided parameters

356
00:20:20,549 --> 00:20:25,370
for ECDs a and this has been very
controversial it's actually still an

357
00:20:25,370 --> 00:20:26,179
open issue

358
00:20:26,179 --> 00:20:30,549
within the working group iron most the
browser vendors

359
00:20:30,549 --> 00:20:34,120
feel like providing this curve is a bad
idea mainly cuz

360
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:37,990
unclear if that her can be right now the
jesus of course

361
00:20:37,990 --> 00:20:41,539
it's a great curve but there's a course
the search a compact concerns

362
00:20:41,539 --> 00:20:46,059
and also the fact that can all the JB
will provide and lip sodium

363
00:20:46,059 --> 00:20:49,490
some very good code the fact that
matters can you replicate the code

364
00:20:49,490 --> 00:20:50,030
across

365
00:20:50,030 --> 00:20:53,110
multiple environments is that is a well
space is a

366
00:20:53,110 --> 00:20:56,110
was best lineup in there is in our I it
here RC

367
00:20:56,110 --> 00:21:00,760
for DJ bees coach yet I mean hopefully
they will be shortly

368
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:05,039
and then if you're going to open up the
door to different easy seeker primers

369
00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:09,820
why don't you open up the door to all
sorts a possible curves

370
00:21:09,820 --> 00:21:13,100
and if you the if you do that

371
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:17,020
what else can you do and this is where
effectively Brian the marquee and other

372
00:21:17,020 --> 00:21:18,970
folks Microsoft have been suggesting

373
00:21:18,970 --> 00:21:22,049
eight new Sep Kors are called than
nothing

374
00:21:22,049 --> 00:21:25,140
up my sleeve curves and these cars
abandoned they want but they already

375
00:21:25,140 --> 00:21:25,909
have them

376
00:21:25,909 --> 00:21:29,120
in Windows on their available on the web

377
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:33,169
that generation Qatar papi from
Microsoft

378
00:21:33,169 --> 00:21:37,280
AK should you expose those the browser
so these is or issues that we have

379
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:41,730
in a working group what kinda algorithm
what parameters

380
00:21:41,730 --> 00:21:46,690
should we let into the PIAA to balance
that with the very real implementation

381
00:21:46,690 --> 00:21:47,919
concerns

382
00:21:47,919 --> 00:21:51,409
right so we don't have DJ be scurred and
in SS

383
00:21:51,409 --> 00:21:55,450
which is this or baseline code which
everyone uses

384
00:21:55,450 --> 00:21:58,960
for all their crypto in the browser's
Lisa pure cross

385
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:04,590
platforms such as chrome and Mozilla
other browsers course call a apple and a

386
00:22:04,590 --> 00:22:06,350
Windows called underlying OS ko

387
00:22:06,350 --> 00:22:10,190
so that's one open issue are another
open issue

388
00:22:10,190 --> 00:22:13,240
is the the poor broken trip to issue

389
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:16,900
so we do give developers possibly a

390
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:21,000
enough trip to shoot themselves in the
foot what the reason why we do this

391
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:25,090
is that we do believe that people will
want some level up backwards

392
00:22:25,090 --> 00:22:26,100
compatibility

393
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:30,380
win you're trying to do very well known
protocols

394
00:22:30,380 --> 00:22:34,000
iSSH for example using the crypto API

395
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:37,620
and we do believe the creepy I is not
just going to use a browser will be sore

396
00:22:37,620 --> 00:22:39,840
standard API across all sorts %uh

397
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:43,909
native JavaScript environments so we of
course we have shot one in there which

398
00:22:43,909 --> 00:22:44,190
is

399
00:22:44,190 --> 00:22:48,220
I broken we did remove PKcs 1.15 cuz

400
00:22:48,220 --> 00:22:53,130
we do we do not authenticate out for
syndication with enough force

401
00:22:53,130 --> 00:22:56,510
additional zation Victor M is Asian

402
00:22:56,510 --> 00:23:00,159
we do not and we have a lot of I with
their which

403
00:23:00,159 --> 00:23:03,320
which of course don't have security
proofs and some of them

404
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:07,270
up some other password base key
derivation functions how

405
00:23:07,270 --> 00:23:10,580
known weaknesses at the same point if we
feel that they

406
00:23:10,580 --> 00:23:14,600
are well specified enough people want
them we are currently at the men were

407
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:15,750
trying to figure out how to make

408
00:23:15,750 --> 00:23:19,880
extensible we do feel like crypto
agility could be a good thing in this is

409
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:20,640
a discussion i'd

410
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:24,860
like to have people here but we also we
don't want to try to force people use a

411
00:23:24,860 --> 00:23:26,490
we think is good crypto

412
00:23:26,490 --> 00:23:30,940
later we discover it's not so try to be
non-judgmental

413
00:23:30,940 --> 00:23:34,770
me one way to put it up now may be the
hardest problem

414
00:23:34,770 --> 00:23:38,710
which we do not tackle is key storage

415
00:23:38,710 --> 00:23:42,429
right so so one along if you want to use
they want to basically do in an

416
00:23:42,429 --> 00:23:43,110
encryption

417
00:23:43,110 --> 00:23:46,309
what some kind of long-term I

418
00:23:46,309 --> 00:23:50,650
private humid here the private key
material is headed from the server so we

419
00:23:50,650 --> 00:23:52,289
try to do the best we can

420
00:23:52,289 --> 00:23:55,539
I'm currently the best worker papi

421
00:23:55,539 --> 00:23:59,659
does is basically does not pass round
the rocky material

422
00:23:59,659 --> 00:24:03,880
it passes around only handlers
identifiers the key material and he is

423
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:04,690
comming mark

424
00:24:04,690 --> 00:24:08,890
as either extractable eyes and I can
extract them

425
00:24:08,890 --> 00:24:13,130
friendship get the rocky material ship
it around

426
00:24:13,130 --> 00:24:17,350
or not so we say well if we can make
easy as we say shouldn't be extracted

427
00:24:17,350 --> 00:24:21,740
we'd also the fine and a rave usages
such in crypt the crypt you don't want

428
00:24:21,740 --> 00:24:23,020
to reuse keys are things

429
00:24:23,020 --> 00:24:27,010
I often destroys never screw properties
they have and we of

430
00:24:27,010 --> 00:24:30,179
in this is what we in we try

431
00:24:30,179 --> 00:24:33,820
we tried to do but there is just
fundamental I am

432
00:24:33,820 --> 00:24:37,120
problems was the web security model

433
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:41,200
serve right now you know we cannot
guarantee those key usage is you gave

434
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:42,580
your encryption and decryption

435
00:24:42,580 --> 00:24:46,650
and assigning actually attack security
or for ever

436
00:24:46,650 --> 00:24:49,679
so we can be removed and change by JS
code

437
00:24:49,679 --> 00:24:52,720
you from the server from the user side

438
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:56,640
and you know we don't preserve those BX
inside key wrapping

439
00:24:56,640 --> 00:25:00,789
in unwrapping operations and and
furthermore

440
00:25:00,789 --> 00:25:05,490
we only offer I am ephemeral keys the
keys are bound to the session

441
00:25:05,490 --> 00:25:10,710
I am is something that was on purpose so
there was a there was a concern

442
00:25:10,710 --> 00:25:15,140
I that effectively law every creating
another magical key storage mechanism

443
00:25:15,140 --> 00:25:19,110
without thinking it through very hard
for longer key materials we were just be

444
00:25:19,110 --> 00:25:19,970
creating

445
00:25:19,970 --> 00:25:25,110
super cuties I we don't really want more
super cookies and we already have

446
00:25:25,110 --> 00:25:29,090
um also we also trying we're trying this
is very different from the encryption

447
00:25:29,090 --> 00:25:30,260
media extensions

448
00:25:30,260 --> 00:25:34,500
I DRM effectively which have been pushed
to a small five

449
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:39,559
not my working group in w3c we were
basically the key material should remain

450
00:25:39,559 --> 00:25:41,690
under user controls the user should
build

451
00:25:41,690 --> 00:25:46,179
to delete keys whatever they want the
should be forced to you

452
00:25:46,179 --> 00:25:49,480
should be committee which is headed from
them in particular

453
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:52,520
arbiter trying to figure out how to get
key storage working

454
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:56,740
in that paradigm into being a very hard
problem

455
00:25:56,740 --> 00:26:00,640
at the same point this law be used as
for thats for having that

456
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:03,799
I and wish will return to those and thus
the

457
00:26:03,799 --> 00:26:08,830
the last thing I which we we notice also
