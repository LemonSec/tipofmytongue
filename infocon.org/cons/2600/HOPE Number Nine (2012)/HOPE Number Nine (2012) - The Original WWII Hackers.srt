athlete had pretty good success about
eighty percent of what they set out to

2
00:00:05,359 --> 00:00:08,039
do but I don't think it would have ever
gotten off the ground

3
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:12,880
Washington for this place and the people
who work there

4

00:00:54,590 --> 00:00:59,490
which for

15
00:00:59,490 --> 00:01:06,070
which you've probably heard so much
about are

16
00:01:06,070 --> 00:01:09,130
I'd been there before but I couldn't
think of a better place to be with a

17
00:01:09,130 --> 00:01:10,210
better group of people

18
00:01:10,210 --> 00:01:13,970
on the day of the Bletchley Park
veterans reunion

19
00:01:13,970 --> 00:01:18,700
there were an actor's displays exhibits
as well as a memorial service to honor

20
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:19,650
the cage

21
00:01:19,650 --> 00:01:22,670
the whole place was sort of just as it
was getting

22
00:01:22,670 --> 00:01:26,070
killed please keep in mind mostly

23
00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:30,520
bomb virtual machine probably heard
about that Alan Turing

24
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:33,979
cool to breaking didn't

25
00:01:33,980 --> 00:01:37,060
research and development that and the
building was torn

26
00:01:37,060 --> 00:01:40,190
pretty much before the war even scored

27
00:01:40,190 --> 00:01:43,230
there were about 200

28
00:01:43,230 --> 00:01:48,560
build their manufacture and one jury is
part of the UK as well as fortune

29
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:51,700
for watch the park which mostly a German

00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:55,180
communications deciphering track

31
00:01:55,180 --> 00:02:02,120
running 24 hours a day and staffed by up
to ten thousand people who are dedicated

32
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:05,970
to their task as well as keeping their
activities totally chic

33
00:02:05,970 --> 00:02:10,490
so much so that many of their families
spouses

34
00:02:10,490 --> 00:02:15,240
as well as parents and children never
knew what they were doing during the war

35
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:20,350
none of them ever revealed anything to
anyone

36
00:02:20,350 --> 00:02:24,280
until just a few years ago compare that
to what's going on now

37
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:28,300
government but the bridge more weeks
coming out of the White House in all

38
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:35,300
across the street and Penn stations
management

39
00:02:37,939 --> 00:02:39,129
I will get to some movie

40
00:02:39,129 --> 00:02:42,290

day of what they had lined up for the

47
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:05,870
veterans

48
00:03:05,870 --> 00:03:09,079

49
00:03:09,079 --> 00:03:13,909
Bari which than himself you heard that

53
00:03:23,959 --> 00:03:27,599
damage exhibits that were around which

know where they got it

56
00:03:35,989 --> 00:03:39,049
he probably car shortly thereafter or

57
00:03:39,049 --> 00:03:43,389
a earlier trying to get me to join the
French Foreign Legion

58
00:03:43,389 --> 00:03:47,669
these guys he came walking up the street
to main saluted as all get some

59
00:03:47,669 --> 00:03:48,509
Americans here

60
00:03:48,509 --> 00:03:53,189
nope reenactors I think my wife Ann
Arbor the only Americans on the whole

61
00:03:53,189 --> 00:03:53,680
place

62
00:03:53,680 --> 00:04:00,680
everybody you're gonna see or bridge and
they did a fantastic job civilians were

63
00:04:00,699 --> 00:04:01,180
there

64
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:05,400
in the forties civilian attire their son
grow

65
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:09,629
but the keys reporter rich

66
00:04:09,629 --> 00:04:13,479
notice ladies are dressed grossly we're
back during the war

67
00:04:13,479 --> 00:04:18,030

first Louis there well she's a brat as
part of the

69
00:04:21,789 --> 00:04:25,259
reenactors but if this guy

70
00:04:25,259 --> 00:04:28,440
I don't think hollywood could come up
with something like that he looks like

71
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:30,830
he just got out of this B-seventeen

72
00:04:30,830 --> 00:04:34,008
after a bombing run on

73
00:04:34,009 --> 00:04:37,770
Bremen but he's a Brit the retort funny
and everything

74
00:04:37,770 --> 00:04:41,758
there's another one there Bernard

75
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:47,570
British guy being interviewed by the
press role bridge

76
00:04:47,570 --> 00:04:51,849
I don't know what the joke is Winston

77
00:04:51,849 --> 00:04:53,070
their pictures of me

78
00:04:53,070 --> 00:04:58,199
must've been funny they're all laughing
my wife thinks that

79
00:04:58,199 --> 00:05:01,630
that was Rosie the Riveter Tigers are

80
00:05:01,630 --> 00:05:05,469
Cunningham's here this is this is one
group

81
00:05:05,469 --> 00:05:09,120
ove for dedicated hamstring

82
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:12,870
rebuild the wartime and previous

83
00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:16,000
radio equipment get all working

84
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:22,190
better than new but they also had the
fans the trucks the mobile antennas

85
00:05:22,190 --> 00:05:25,779
when I first walked up to this thing as
a point that is a field day

86
00:05:25,779 --> 00:05:30,190
couldn't be but they were demonstrating
their gear

87
00:05:30,190 --> 00:05:33,949
everything is working probably better

88
00:05:33,949 --> 00:05:38,020
been what was billed including the fans
on me know

89
00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:44,099
engines and everything perfect they're
very serious about what they do

90
00:05:44,099 --> 00:05:47,529
here they have some Hampshire accent up
outside

91
00:05:47,529 --> 00:05:52,930
be there's some more the equipment are
you may recognize

92
00:05:52,930 --> 00:05:57,949
you know if your hand you may recognize
or tribes here

93
00:05:57,949 --> 00:06:02,500
this to happen again years ago

94
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:07,010
and this receiver this is the receiver
of choice that they used to

95
00:06:07,010 --> 00:06:10,550
watch we can all be out stations for
reaching German

96
00:06:10,550 --> 00:06:14,449
Kong's the national HR row it's a

97
00:06:14,449 --> 00:06:20,159
2 230 megahertz reseal but it's not ban
switching to change fancy have to take

98
00:06:20,159 --> 00:06:20,800
this little

99

tree of quayle's out employed another
tray

100
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:28,229
in I think came with about 45 traced to
cover the whole

101
00:06:28,229 --> 00:06:32,680
the whole band can add

102
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:36,650
everything yeah prewar

103
00:06:36,650 --> 00:06:39,909

106
00:06:47,229 --> 00:06:52,659
near my wife is sitting in church alone
share and she's holding

107
00:06:52,659 --> 00:06:56,229
box of cigars that shits in this little
space

108
00:06:56,229 --> 00:06:59,310
under his chair and they are good

109
00:06:59,310 --> 00:07:02,769
profanity cigars she she wanted to smoke

110
00:07:02,769 --> 00:07:08,810
just didn't have enough but that's his
own share checked there is the owner

111
00:07:08,810 --> 00:07:11,829
and assisted

112
00:07:11,829 --> 00:07:15,800
everything on display not a way or two

113
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:20,269
watch with veterans just before we were
there few weeks before we were there was

114
00:07:20,269 --> 00:07:21,810
another lady

115
00:07:21,810 --> 00:07:24,930
it gave a terrific speech commemorating
the

116
00:07:24,930 --> 00:07:28,560
World War two I hate to say the word

117
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:32,240
hackers she gave a terrific speech

118
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:35,289
as a Cryptologic I can certainly
appreciate it

119
00:07:35,289 --> 00:07:42,289
see if you recognize yr

120
00:07:42,519 --> 00:07:45,539
in almost 1939

121
00:07:45,539 --> 00:07:49,440
200 people arrived at Bletchley Park

122
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:55,000
by the end of 1944 10,000

123
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,690
we gather here to commemorate the work

124
00:07:57,690 --> 00:08:01,800
that remarkable group of people

125
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:04,800
it is impossible to every state that's
the bomb working

126
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:08,040
admiration and gratitude and national
debt

127
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:13,470
30 all is men and the special meaning
David call to this place

128
00:08:13,470 --> 00:08:17,210
immigrate to secrecy so much so

129
00:08:17,210 --> 00:08:21,070
summon their families will never know
the full extent

130
00:08:21,070 --> 00:08:24,930
that contribution as they set about

131
00:08:24,930 --> 00:08:29,050
on a seemingly impossible mission a
massive challenge

132
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:33,060
in the field cryptanalysis for the first
time

133
00:08:33,060 --> 00:08:39,110
pitching technology gates technology

134
00:08:39,110 --> 00:08:43,669
pension these had two buildings became
the sender worldwide with intelligence

135
00:08:43,669 --> 00:08:44,900
communications

136
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:48,459
spending the common wall and further
afield

137
00:08:48,460 --> 00:08:53,380
this is the place in geniuses such as
Alan Turing

138
00:08:53,380 --> 00:08:57,250
but these wonderfully clever
mathematicians

139
00:08:57,250 --> 00:09:02,600
language graduates an engineer's well
complemented by people

140
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:07,330
with different shit skills punishing
that millions

141
00:09:07,330 --> 00:09:10,810
through methodical and gamers home sold

142
00:09:10,810 --> 00:09:14,350
dust the secret agent that she's success

143
00:09:14,350 --> 00:09:20,060
was that it became a home all the
talents

144
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:23,530
we can be proud to the legacy election
prior to the

145
00:09:23,530 --> 00:09:27,959
chaos is the first computer and that the
British people

146
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:31,390
supported by our friends and analyze

147
00:09:31,390 --> 00:09:35,270
rose to the challenge

148
00:09:35,270 --> 00:09:38,720
at heart we have always been a nation
and problem solvers

149
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:42,820
this natural aptitude was taken to new
heights

150
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:47,890
by the emergency wall showing that
necessity is indeed the mother of

151
00:09:47,890 --> 00:09:48,730
invention

152
00:09:48,730 --> 00:09:52,530
and the battles can be won many lives
saved

153
00:09:52,530 --> 00:09:56,110
by using grain farm as well as far Paul

154
00:09:56,110 --> 00:10:01,589
deliberation as well as force

155
00:10:01,589 --> 00:10:06,019
to those veterans who remain I'll for
nothing but praise

156
00:10:06,019 --> 00:10:10,649
your history shapers and your example
serves

157
00:10:10,649 --> 00:10:14,110
as inspiration to the intelligence
community

158
00:10:14,110 --> 00:10:17,569
today as they continue the right away

159
00:10:17,569 --> 00:10:22,500
to protect the people in this country
feel many achievements

160
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:25,649
I get my heartfelt thanks on behalf of

161
00:10:25,649 --> 00:10:32,649
all internally grateful nation I think
that the song

162
00:10:32,649 --> 00:10:38,470
great speech a the only cold we had to
break my wife and I was

163
00:10:38,470 --> 00:10:42,699
how do you identify who were the voters
well turns out that

164
00:10:42,699 --> 00:10:46,319
they were all awarded the Ministry of
Defence Bletchley Park

165
00:10:46,319 --> 00:10:51,240
veterans batch which ladies holding we
would call it a pin

166
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:55,149
but they call it a batch that's the
slightly better picture of it

167
00:10:55,149 --> 00:11:00,970
also there's a GCHQ Bushwick Park
commemorative badge for service

168
00:11:00,970 --> 00:11:04,610
at Bletchley and the outstation I was
able to get a good picture

169
00:11:04,610 --> 00:11:10,130
and first gentlemen we ran into was
Arthur Smith

170
00:11:10,130 --> 00:11:13,939
P decoded the fish battered she joined
on the thirteenth the

171
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:18,120
may 44 here at six days of training the
fish methods

172
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:21,240
was the system the used to break out

173
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:24,440
hitler's high command communications

174
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:27,800
which was going on your fashion teletype

175
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:31,170
dollar 7 Bordeaux system teletype

176
00:11:31,170 --> 00:11:34,529
mostly people probably never saw it
because it went out in

177
00:11:34,529 --> 00:11:37,589
business years ago I am but

178
00:11:37,589 --> 00:11:41,750
his typical 0 the people they had their
six days of training

179
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:45,680
and he picked up on it himself and
you'll see the system colossus

180
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:49,540
that which used its been restored

181
00:11:49,540 --> 00:11:53,349
night herschel here fearsome
interestingly

182
00:11:53,350 --> 00:11:56,810
Shorewood not to be confused with the
spider

183
00:11:56,810 --> 00:12:00,620
but she your I

184
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:03,790
she was very interesting was talking
with your

185
00:12:03,790 --> 00:12:07,329
archie registered intercepted traffic

186
00:12:07,329 --> 00:12:12,040
decoded analyzed it and pass a traffic
to commanders as well as churchill

187
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:12,639
himself

188
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:16,639
in 1945 she was flown to the pentagon

189
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:19,880
and assortments Sunderland flying boat

190
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:24,350
which was a 30-hour flight will she
continue to serve as an ambush

191
00:12:24,350 --> 00:12:28,019
in 30-hour flight test but what it takes
to get from

192
00:12:28,019 --> 00:12:33,319
Newark Airport to washington died she
wrote a poor

193
00:12:33,319 --> 00:12:37,189
internal secret postings from Bletchley
Park to the panic

194
00:12:37,189 --> 00:12:41,559
while we were chatting she turned the
tables on me

195
00:12:41,559 --> 00:12:45,160
and caught me by surprise she asked me

196
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:49,010
how I felt about 9/11 and

197
00:12:49,010 --> 00:12:54,370
wasn't expecting that I just off the top
of my head is a while

198
00:12:54,370 --> 00:13:01,360
was pretty depressing couple more people
door slightly issues on Morse operator

199
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:03,160
at Yorkshire more Morrish

200
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:08,439
and the gentleman sitting next to her he
was there with a shock the hood

201
00:13:08,439 --> 00:13:12,170
I don't remember he told me what should
be witch hunt but I took a

202
00:13:12,170 --> 00:13:16,019
I don't remember and will try to guess

203
00:13:16,019 --> 00:13:21,420
I somebody's morse operators

204
00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:26,569
work were unbelievable which to clear it
copied German called for

205
00:13:26,569 --> 00:13:30,050
12-16 hours day and they got

206
00:13:30,050 --> 00:13:35,649
real good at it and one of them was
saying that they were so afraid to make

207
00:13:35,649 --> 00:13:38,360
a single mistake because it would hurt
the war effort

208
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:41,949
also the got to be

209
00:13:41,949 --> 00:13:45,740
so good at it they could identify the
German operators by their

210
00:13:45,740 --> 00:13:50,389
fist and that along with valuable
intelligence

211
00:13:50,389 --> 00:13:53,420
so they could change call signs that
could change

212
00:13:53,420 --> 00:13:57,110
locations but these gals new thats Hans

213
00:13:57,110 --> 00:14:03,439
trips you can't fool me other weighty
Edna gambit she worked in hutch six she

214
00:14:03,439 --> 00:14:04,529
was an intelligence

215
00:14:04,529 --> 00:14:11,110
analyst this was kinda touching these

218
00:14:18,890 --> 00:14:22,510
she walked around with it see if anybody
could identify your

219
00:14:22,510 --> 00:14:25,569
hand as of the time we're speaking with

torch that she gives on

236
00:15:23,049 --> 00:15:26,829
code-breaking during the war it's very
interesting

237
00:15:26,829 --> 00:15:30,799
for she get her here which referred

238
00:15:30,799 --> 00:15:34,189

receivers

246
00:15:57,819 --> 00:16:01,189
Marjorie Russell harbory trained on the
Isle of Man

laughing she said that she didn't know
what all the fuss was about

249
00:16:10,990 --> 00:16:14,399
when she finally got to see an indignant
machine she said

250
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:18,000
it's just a teddy old typewriter

251
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,819
Norma Granger Smith she worked in hot d

administration in heart for and right
there she's pointing to hunt for Intel

257
00:16:44,510 --> 00:16:50,490
images will mad because it may hurt
foreign to the cafeteria

258
00:16:50,490 --> 00:16:54,939
your report hut 8 worked on tight pics
machine and she was

259
00:16:54,939 --> 00:16:58,099
dynamite but before eight finish with
her

260
00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:01,799
you notice in the background they're
running the

261
00:17:01,799 --> 00:17:06,449
ball they're actually thing is cranking
away

262
00:17:06,449 --> 00:17:10,770
break in coaching what happy that they
had put into it

263
00:17:10,770 --> 00:17:14,148
one other things that the gentleman that
was running it explained to us that

264
00:17:14,149 --> 00:17:18,540
1 I've kluge they had for determining
the daily

265
00:17:18,540 --> 00:17:22,059
cold the enigma daily code

266
00:17:22,059 --> 00:17:25,280
which the copied the some

267
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:28,960
the whether ship's open in North Sea

268
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:32,280
because they send out Hydra reports
every day

269
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:35,730
and in the preamble each one of these
reports

270
00:17:35,730 --> 00:17:38,870
was a couple words that identified it

271
00:17:38,870 --> 00:17:43,540
as the weather report if they have said
Deed writer or later or something like

272
00:17:43,540 --> 00:17:44,360
that I think

273
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:47,830
what it was but was always in the same
place

274
00:17:47,830 --> 00:17:51,428
was always a cryptid so there's part of
the key

275
00:17:51,429 --> 00:17:55,270
right there at the end of every one of
these messages

276
00:17:55,270 --> 00:17:59,020
you know with how they signed off Heil
Hitler

277
00:17:59,020 --> 00:18:04,799
so that was another club and fight just
get off the subject from

278
00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:08,470
when I was stationed in Bremerhaven
Germany before we moved into base

279
00:18:08,470 --> 00:18:09,809
housing

280
00:18:09,809 --> 00:18:13,570
my wife and I read to them an apartment
the top

281
00:18:13,570 --> 00:18:18,990
floor a private home couple towns away
from the base

282
00:18:18,990 --> 00:18:23,850
our landlord and landlady with great
people they treated us like family

283
00:18:23,850 --> 00:18:26,950
and many times we were sitting in the
living room with them in the evening

284
00:18:26,950 --> 00:18:30,000
sitting around bullshitting with them
having a beer

285
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,840
and they would spend a lotta time
telling us what it was like being in

286
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:33,520
Germany

287
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:36,899
20s the region during the war they were
in the Hitler Youth

288
00:18:36,899 --> 00:18:41,950
wooden they were shamed over they
shouldn't be

289
00:18:41,950 --> 00:18:45,610
but Klaus was in a creature marine

290
00:18:45,610 --> 00:18:49,419
the I which

291
00:18:49,419 --> 00:18:53,200
on one of those weather ships in the
North Sea until the Brits

292
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:57,540
corn and he was a PO W

293
00:18:57,540 --> 00:19:02,530
here he was a British POWs and then they
sold him to the Americans

294
00:19:02,530 --> 00:19:05,840
and he spent couple years out in
california

295
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:10,340
picking mice mice picking fights with
your YouTube

296
00:19:10,340 --> 00:19:14,370
what you do with the mice is out the
American state eat it

297
00:19:14,370 --> 00:19:18,340
he was talking about corn

298
00:19:18,340 --> 00:19:21,500
but I had my ham radio shacks setup

299
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:25,629
in the living the house and many times

300
00:19:25,629 --> 00:19:29,760
he would come up there and he would just
his eyes were popping out of his head

301
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:34,210
key loath to watch me operate my Hamsik

302
00:19:34,210 --> 00:19:39,169
and all I worked over there was CW Morse
code

303
00:19:39,169 --> 00:19:42,740
and i was just reminded of this a couple
weeks ago

304
00:19:42,740 --> 00:19:45,940
Cup with the guys that took over my
apartment

305
00:19:45,940 --> 00:19:49,690
we would need to base housing were also
hams he had their him here there &

306
00:19:49,690 --> 00:19:52,879
when the guys remind me but Klaus

307
00:19:52,879 --> 00:19:56,300
had a very good working knowledge

308
00:19:56,300 --> 00:19:59,320
more school we put that together

309
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:03,100
with he was gently removed from

310
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:06,550
one of those weather ships up in the
North Sea course a British

311
00:20:06,550 --> 00:20:09,790
wanted people the add-on for the
intelligence

312
00:20:09,790 --> 00:20:14,559
as well was the inning machines on Smith
on sports

313
00:20:14,559 --> 00:20:18,010
unfortunately he's been gone many years

314
00:20:18,010 --> 00:20:23,399
at work too grow along what was going on

315
00:20:23,399 --> 00:20:26,659
meanwhile back to appear a

316
00:20:26,659 --> 00:20:30,030
here she is showing me her type pics
model

317
00:20:30,030 --> 00:20:34,520
23 cipher machine this was the British
version

318
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:39,110
greatly improved but the indignant it
works sorta like it

319
00:20:39,110 --> 00:20:43,020
accepted had more rotors bigger patch
field and everything

320
00:20:43,020 --> 00:20:46,860
she operated this machine she would she
was taking

321
00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:50,500
the war are not the war the

322
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:53,929
broken out skinny putting it on

323
00:20:53,929 --> 00:20:57,590
this tight-knit this description machine

324
00:20:57,590 --> 00:21:01,439
and what right into churchill's Bacher
which is in

325
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:05,480
wanted and if you're over there take the
time to go through it

326
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:09,520
it's it's a tourist trap its downtowns
not far from the year

327
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:12,780
westminster Abbey in that but part of
town it's fake tits

328
00:21:12,780 --> 00:21:16,270
it's fantastic which she actually had
all the stuff

329
00:21:16,270 --> 00:21:19,679
in her hands on her what time she wasn't
the only one

330
00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:23,750
she was one and she showing it to me
which you it's so excited

331
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:27,580
showing it to me and so proud

332
00:21:27,580 --> 00:21:31,360
and this is what it looks like a up
close the two big brown things on either

333
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:31,950
side

334
00:21:31,950 --> 00:21:38,530
or printed would print the plain text
and you prefer to text

335
00:21:38,530 --> 00:21:42,550
they had a reunion service for the
veterans

336
00:21:42,550 --> 00:21:46,780
and this was the complete service it was
very well done short and to the point

337
00:21:46,780 --> 00:21:52,119
has a biopsy to minister do something
the short I am

338
00:21:52,119 --> 00:21:55,570
these are some of the year veterans at

339
00:21:55,570 --> 00:21:58,780
at the memorial when you know it's a one
lady there she has

340
00:21:58,780 --> 00:22:02,320
to over the are

341
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:07,260
Ministry of Defence Bletchley badges one
was a hostage

342
00:22:07,260 --> 00:22:11,158
so just the small subunit tough day for
there's a lotta marriages that took

343
00:22:11,159 --> 00:22:12,450
place there too

344
00:22:12,450 --> 00:22:15,540
a lot of dating course

345
00:22:15,540 --> 00:22:19,250
no hanky panky of course

346
00:22:19,250 --> 00:22:23,320
and be regrouping veterans

347
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:30,230
those guys there to the younger people
were families of veterans

348
00:22:30,230 --> 00:22:34,840
and yours group your actuators just took
me reacting they're enjoying

349
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:38,899
their reunion as marchers was navy guys
enjoy your

350
00:22:38,899 --> 00:22:44,990
reunions pretty a bad pipers

351
00:22:44,990 --> 00:22:49,760
she could that color guard

352
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:54,690
you can see there's many of but we
started with around 10,000

353
00:22:54,690 --> 00:22:58,040
this is the picture of the whole group
together

354
00:22:58,040 --> 00:23:01,899
I tried to get a head on shot over to
the left but the BBC was over there and

355
00:23:01,899 --> 00:23:02,250
they kept

356
00:23:02,250 --> 00:23:07,639
you don't want to be in it get out of
the way it wasn't only work for CVS

357
00:23:07,639 --> 00:23:11,000
this is the Rockford to churchill stood
on when he addressed

358
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:14,980
the crew at Bletchley worry call them

359
00:23:14,980 --> 00:23:17,980
my keys that laid the golden eggs but
never checked

360
00:23:17,980 --> 00:23:21,000
be the gentleman but but that's my wife
on the

361
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:24,840
rock and a gentleman next door was our
tour guide

362
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:28,168
droning damn who was dynamite

363
00:23:28,169 --> 00:23:31,820
if you're going to pledge Lee and you
can get it or ask for Dan

364
00:23:31,820 --> 00:23:35,330
he's an Irishman and he just kept
one-story

365
00:23:35,330 --> 00:23:38,780
after another if it was really terrific

366
00:23:38,780 --> 00:23:44,530
seriously talking about the bomb that's
not one of the working ones

367
00:23:44,530 --> 00:23:47,918
this is a Polish memorial to for the
polish

368
00:23:47,919 --> 00:23:50,960
mathematicians

369
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:54,610
the big in the 30s these guys came up

370
00:23:54,610 --> 00:23:58,610
with P best I can describe it is a
mathematical

371
00:23:58,610 --> 00:24:01,809
model the Enigma machine

372
00:24:01,809 --> 00:24:06,210
and this is where they got the
information

373
00:24:06,210 --> 00:24:10,080
touring took written came up with the
bomb

374
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:13,260
how how they did it I don't know they
didn't have computers back to an

375
00:24:13,260 --> 00:24:17,919
muscle taken a lot of paper and pencils
now here's a claw since this is the

376
00:24:17,919 --> 00:24:21,090
system that broke out the

377
00:24:21,090 --> 00:24:25,668
critical for fish methods the hitler's

378
00:24:25,669 --> 00:24:29,899
high command communications

379
00:24:29,899 --> 00:24:33,610
heads to now it's kinda nickname
hitler's blackberry

380
00:24:33,610 --> 00:24:37,119
was a teletype system you can see
they've got tomb

381
00:24:37,119 --> 00:24:40,700
car teletype tape

382
00:24:40,700 --> 00:24:44,510
loops running one is constantly want
your

383
00:24:44,510 --> 00:24:48,369
running with the daily the perfect age
traffic on it

384
00:24:48,369 --> 00:24:52,309
it's it's quite a system it was breaking
it out

385
00:24:52,309 --> 00:24:56,540
almost in real time believe it or not

386
00:24:56,540 --> 00:25:01,550
and their moreover the general with a
blue shirt he was just there to

387
00:25:01,550 --> 00:25:05,690
say here's the crisis this guy was sharp

388
00:25:05,690 --> 00:25:09,750
are we me through a couple technical
questions Adam and boy did he answer he

389
00:25:09,750 --> 00:25:10,129
was

390
00:25:10,129 --> 00:25:14,330
he was really terrific

391
00:25:14,330 --> 00:25:17,540
are this is the moral moral recently

392
00:25:17,540 --> 00:25:21,270
dedicated by the Queen as you for dinner
speech

393
00:25:21,270 --> 00:25:27,629
yeah if you can break it out it says on
there we've also searched

394
00:25:27,629 --> 00:25:31,879
where she is dedicating it

395
00:25:31,879 --> 00:25:36,980
and this is our Navy group from the bomb

396
00:25:36,980 --> 00:25:41,889
one was here today for your Fred

397
00:25:41,889 --> 00:25:48,190
has a collection of a nickname change me
about a dozen of them

398
00:25:48,190 --> 00:25:52,559
this machine this is an enigma machine
OnPoint mick jagger

399
00:25:52,559 --> 00:25:55,760
it's on it's on Mon toward a permanent
mold to Bletchley which

400
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:59,860
I think is a terrific thing to do

401
00:25:59,860 --> 00:26:04,500
now this is a statue around touring

402
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:07,590
to honor of your sister ever saw the
play

403
00:26:07,590 --> 00:26:10,940
in New York few years ago called
breaking the cold with their

404
00:26:10,940 --> 00:26:14,809
Jack Kirby was all about Alan Turing

405
00:26:14,809 --> 00:26:18,860
he built upon he ended the war

406
00:26:18,860 --> 00:26:23,840
after the war was ended because of him
the figure a couple years early

407
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:28,460
and he was a genius probably IQ up there
with

408
00:26:28,460 --> 00:26:32,600
priced he's credited with building the
first

409
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:35,679
digital computer or as he called it P

410
00:26:35,679 --> 00:26:40,210
programmable Roger to voice for the
sport programme

411
00:26:40,210 --> 00:26:45,250
someone computer to me

412
00:26:45,250 --> 00:26:48,389
he did all this for I guess what

413
00:26:48,389 --> 00:26:52,840
be built a computer is working at
Manchester University after the war

414
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:56,090
and he wasn't every scientific theory
you can think of

415
00:26:56,090 --> 00:27:00,080
use also ripple ornery been known to run
from Bletchley

416
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:05,500
to bond which is about 90 miles

417
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:08,810
I'm think he did it every day

418
00:27:08,810 --> 00:27:13,520
when he had a ser problems also he was
gay

419
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:18,500
he was autistic arm

420
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:21,540
and yes a personality problems

421
00:27:21,540 --> 00:27:25,060
and during that time and after the war
it was

422
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:28,418
illegal to be gay in the UK

423
00:27:28,419 --> 00:27:32,290
you're gay you go to jail apparently

424
00:27:32,290 --> 00:27:35,970
he let it slip I think to a cop that he
was having

425
00:27:35,970 --> 00:27:40,730
a and share with some guy in cop
arrested on

426
00:27:40,730 --> 00:27:44,030
and I just because I Hui was they tried
to fix them with

427
00:27:44,030 --> 00:27:47,970
campaign shots and everything but it
didn't work

428
00:27:47,970 --> 00:27:51,109
and shortly before he was go to trial

429
00:27:51,109 --> 00:27:56,689
he killed himself and we killed himself
was it took an apple

430
00:27:56,690 --> 00:28:00,490
but some cyanogen took a bite out of the
Apple

431
00:28:00,490 --> 00:28:04,339
benny was gone

432
00:28:04,339 --> 00:28:10,010
now deserve ring any bells with running

433
00:28:10,010 --> 00:28:14,720
that little scenario there has affected
world

434
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:19,369
probably everybody here even if it's
just an awareness

435
00:28:19,369 --> 00:28:23,929
and before I tell you what it is our

436
00:28:23,929 --> 00:28:27,389
you may be aware there's a lot a
controversy about this

437
00:28:27,389 --> 00:28:31,429
very subject if you look it up on the
Internet you're gonna see

438
00:28:31,429 --> 00:28:35,500
all kinds of bullshit and

439
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:38,889
I believe what watch report tools

440
00:28:38,889 --> 00:28:43,119
because I think now that everybody else
is out of the picture

441
00:28:43,119 --> 00:28:48,970
they are the authority

442
00:28:48,970 --> 00:28:55,970
there's your Apple there's your caller
stirs the bite taken out of it

443
00:28:58,020 --> 00:29:01,280
mica CI I believe what to eat or support
you cannot tell you when they

444
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:04,839
mention that I said huh

445
00:29:04,839 --> 00:29:08,310
at never even i'd never associated the
two

446
00:29:08,310 --> 00:29:13,389
at all so

447
00:29:13,389 --> 00:29:16,730
now this is a a little personal here for
some concern this

448
00:29:16,730 --> 00:29:19,960
this is a Tony sale tony is a retired

449
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:23,399
GCHQ engineer company why

450
00:29:23,399 --> 00:29:30,190
he's a guy that rebuilt closest almost
from scratch

451
00:29:30,190 --> 00:29:34,389
he established the Bletchley trust be
put Bletchley back on the map

452
00:29:34,389 --> 00:29:37,820
as K

453
00:29:37,820 --> 00:29:43,270
national treasure couple days before he
went to pledge week

454
00:29:43,270 --> 00:29:46,690
had picked up on rwanda newspapers in
urs I think

455
00:29:46,690 --> 00:29:49,700
that very picture with a four-page open

456
00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:53,160
it just died which was

457
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:57,680
unfortunate because I don't have a
chance freedom here is showing the year

458
00:29:57,680 --> 00:30:03,500
closest to the Queen there's a great
picture of him

459
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:07,670
there is demonstrating in the reason I
mention him

460
00:30:07,670 --> 00:30:11,950
track that he passed away this morning a
bee group got there we're at the gate

461
00:30:11,950 --> 00:30:15,580
I aster gate follows

462
00:30:15,580 --> 00:30:19,370
where should we go they expect us as
well

463
00:30:19,370 --> 00:30:24,370
go to the mansion and look for Margaret
okay information go on the market

464
00:30:24,370 --> 00:30:28,110
well was Margaret sale his wife for

465
00:30:28,110 --> 00:30:33,510
will issue core and she was there
walking around with a walkie-talkie

466
00:30:33,510 --> 00:30:36,390
barking orders directing the place and
everything

467
00:30:36,390 --> 00:30:40,910
and a particular she took such great
care of us

468
00:30:40,910 --> 00:30:47,910
the Navy guys shit coffee tea and
crumpets waiting for us when we got

469
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:48,880
there

470
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:53,830
she had a launch force that was outta
this world she made a shepherd's pie

471
00:30:53,830 --> 00:30:59,639
Fred Meyer fighting or leftovers is your
guy I know they can eat more in me

472
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:02,980
and then when we left she had

473
00:31:02,980 --> 00:31:07,350
coffee tea and crumpets winning force
and good shooting occurred

474
00:31:07,350 --> 00:31:12,550
tremendous wars she's quite a lady so my
wife and I just don't doubt

475
00:31:12,550 --> 00:31:16,100
took all the problems we had with this
and everything and donated toward right

476
00:31:16,100 --> 00:31:20,030
there she said work they're going to use
it to paint wanna hearts

477
00:31:20,030 --> 00:31:27,030
September 2nd month after next to doing
it again

478
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:32,280
gonna happen that that's when the next
annual reunion is going to be a watch

479
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:36,300
if anybody's gonna be in the UK if you
can swing it

480
00:31:36,300 --> 00:31:40,700
goal you will never forget my wife and I
are gonna be there

481
00:31:40,700 --> 00:31:46,270
we've already got our reservations and
everything last week

482
00:31:46,270 --> 00:31:51,370
friendly Olympic torch through Bletchley
they don't miss the fact that you think

483
00:31:51,370 --> 00:31:52,650
you everything so well

484
00:31:52,650 --> 00:31:56,970
and this is something they did not do

485
00:31:56,970 --> 00:32:01,070
because it was foggy and rainy but they
did the year before

486
00:32:01,070 --> 00:32:04,790
and I think if they had done it what we
were there

487
00:32:04,790 --> 00:32:09,450
I would probably still have to push pops
fictional Lancaster

489
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:21,680

493
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:56,669
if you like what you do airplanes I do

494
00:32:56,669 --> 00:33:03,669
but this was something

495
00:33:06,980 --> 00:33:10,890

00:35:30,900 --> 00:35:34,300
wanna throw something at me please do
but first we just play one out here

521
00:35:34,300 --> 00:35:35,490
getting veterans here

522
00:35:35,490 --> 00:35:42,490
stand up

523
00:35:51,450 --> 00:35:55,000
priorities guys who appear are were
known

524
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:59,690
as US Navy cripple logic technicians

525
00:35:59,690 --> 00:36:04,400
they were professional hackers and their
just about the best

526
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:08,000
were want role was in Iceland

527
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:11,039
alaska and Winter Harbor Maine

528
00:36:11,039 --> 00:36:15,140
so the guy here use it on Guam

529
00:36:15,140 --> 00:36:18,750
tracking the whole Russian fleet

530
00:36:18,750 --> 00:36:23,640
I so everybody has a thing or two from

531
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:30,640
go ahead yeah please

532
00:36:46,620 --> 00:36:50,080
I I think one had the traffic on it

533
00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:53,990
being perpetrated for and the other had
some foreign

534
00:36:53,990 --> 00:37:00,990
old the key

535
00:37:14,710 --> 00:37:21,710
but could be

536
00:37:23,980 --> 00:37:27,800
I think that thing I would do a X or
fortune between the two

537
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:31,140
and yeah they may have been able to
store

538
00:37:31,140 --> 00:37:34,720
Stourport a bit in there ya because they
add did

539
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:41,720
they did have a bloated to dinner for

540
00:37:56,930 --> 00:38:03,930
him

541
00:38:06,330 --> 00:38:07,580
for export I didn't know

542
00:38:07,580 --> 00:38:14,580
interested

543
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:26,800
name

544
00:38:51,579 --> 00:38:53,049
know we build our bomb

545
00:38:53,049 --> 00:38:56,589
we had a bomb which had one more rotor
the

546
00:38:56,589 --> 00:38:59,859
British bomb touring actually came over
here

547
00:38:59,859 --> 00:39:04,509
to Dayton Mitchell catcher issue with
the building he was actually over here

548
00:39:04,509 --> 00:39:11,509
working on it

549
00:39:46,170 --> 00:39:53,170
yes

550
00:39:56,599 --> 00:39:58,690
but funny you should mention that
because

551
00:39:58,690 --> 00:40:02,560
in all the stuff that I've been
brainwashed within the navy

552
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:06,040
are we've heard a lot about your Wheaton

553
00:40:06,040 --> 00:40:10,250
we broke the approval code or last 5
never seen any

554
00:40:10,250 --> 00:40:13,890
equipment poured until last Christmas I
was approached Harbor

555
00:40:13,890 --> 00:40:17,160
and before you take the

556
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:20,328
boat out to the Arizona they have

557
00:40:20,329 --> 00:40:25,020
museum there on shore and i'm looking at
something and holy mackerel hear such

558
00:40:25,020 --> 00:40:27,410
great big wooden boxes this is

559
00:40:27,410 --> 00:40:32,649
the purple machine and it looks like it
has just a buncha telephone releasing it

560
00:40:32,650 --> 00:40:34,829
but that's the only thing I've ever seen

561
00:40:34,829 --> 00:40:38,640
on per so

562
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:41,859
it could have been done out there
although up

563
00:40:41,859 --> 00:40:45,440
actually I don't know where they did

564
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:49,369
I just presumed it was in the Washington
area but

565
00:40:49,369 --> 00:40:53,530
that makes sense because are you looking
at the pacific fleet and what-have-you

566
00:40:53,530 --> 00:41:00,530
yet but we had we had people out in

567
00:41:02,619 --> 00:41:06,040
Pacific also called the from Pak which
is sweet

568
00:41:06,040 --> 00:41:09,310
radio unit Pacific there's a buncha guys
out there

569
00:41:09,310 --> 00:41:12,490
all over the place copying the code and
they were actually be crippling

570
00:41:12,490 --> 00:41:19,490
japanese girls out there also

571
00:41:20,999 --> 00:41:27,999
that could be the what

572
00:41:33,210 --> 00:41:39,240
we have tried to do what no why he also
I think that's where they had the a

573
00:41:39,240 --> 00:41:40,339
purple machine there

574
00:41:40,339 --> 00:41:47,339
but that was one time I'd ever seen

575
00:42:36,580 --> 00:42:40,360
yours what a country's even after the
war using the German technical

576
00:42:40,360 --> 00:42:47,360
she's I think they started out in the
banking business

577
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,070
look for Fred here is still

578
00:43:38,070 --> 00:43:41,980
he did some packing this morning I
couldn't leave

579
00:43:41,980 --> 00:43:47,400
tried to hit Guyana real bob and I run a
train coming down from Port Jervis this

580
00:43:47,400 --> 00:43:47,970
morning

581
00:43:47,970 --> 00:43:50,980
and we get to the oldest will station
and it stopped

582
00:43:50,980 --> 00:43:55,880
it quit the engine gave out and I was
talking to Fred

583
00:43:55,880 --> 00:44:00,010
on my cell phone just as the conductor
came walking down the aisle

584
00:44:00,010 --> 00:44:04,490
was a woman conductor and she says the
trade stop it going anywhere

585
00:44:04,490 --> 00:44:10,730
here burdick who's leveling bot

586
00:44:10,730 --> 00:44:14,609
and it was nothing we can do but just
sit there and wait for the next train

587
00:44:14,609 --> 00:44:16,819
other port jervis which is one hour and
a half

588
00:44:16,820 --> 00:44:23,820
player I just inadvertent hacking

589
00:44:35,609 --> 00:44:36,359
so thank you all for coming
