1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:04,100
future which is why you shouldn't right
of higher education

2
00:00:04,100 --> 00:00:10,130
are the

3
00:00:10,130 --> 00:00:14,009
other side up the slides are up so this
is a

4
00:00:14,009 --> 00:00:18,170
every user community um menus are
communities have their

5
00:00:18,170 --> 00:00:22,100
their comic their cartoon the describes
life if you go back to world war two

6
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:25,060
infantrymen if you had a chance to read
Willie and Joe cartoons its

7
00:00:25,060 --> 00:00:28,439
it's fascinating it's heartbreaking no
fast warning today if you like

8
00:00:28,439 --> 00:00:32,920
mathematics in science you get xkcd if
you like games you get in your case if

9
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:35,739
you have to suffer through systems
administration you get user friendly

10
00:00:35,739 --> 00:00:39,399
and if you're in graduate school you
have PhD comics that comp I'll higher

11
00:00:39,399 --> 00:00:40,050
and deeper

12
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:44,010
I'm this one is titled How grad school
is just like kindergarten this isn't my

13
00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:44,940
cartoon by the way

14
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:49,530
um all the napping is acceptable there
is constant adult supervision you can

15
00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:51,969
see an advisor looking over the research
scientist shoulder

16
00:00:51,969 --> 00:00:55,160
you get cookies for lunch there's a
surprising amount of free food

17
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:57,210
especially when there's external
speakers coming

18
00:00:57,210 --> 00:01:00,989
are the most common activity is cutting
and pasting I'm

19
00:01:00,989 --> 00:01:04,790
there are no grades you just have to
play well with others I'm in particular

20
00:01:04,790 --> 00:01:05,770
you can see the

21
00:01:05,770 --> 00:01:09,789
the frazzled student the speaking to a
skeptical and hostile audience not

22
00:01:09,790 --> 00:01:14,530
perhaps unlike the current situation and
finally crying for your mommy is normal

23
00:01:14,530 --> 00:01:18,689
PhD takes about six years on average
sometimes more sometimes less

24
00:01:18,689 --> 00:01:22,250
about your four you start questioning
all the choices that you made with your

25
00:01:22,250 --> 00:01:24,729
life and whether or not you can do
anything to get outta school more

26
00:01:24,729 --> 00:01:25,250
quickly

27
00:01:25,250 --> 00:01:28,000
which is actually the right thing to
field is that cause you to buckle down

28
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,439
and finish in six years

29
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:32,619
so my talk

30
00:01:32,619 --> 00:01:36,350
why you shouldn't give up on higher
education young grasshopper the

31
00:01:36,350 --> 00:01:39,740
the point that I'm trying to convey with
the talk is

32
00:01:39,740 --> 00:01:43,570
why hackers should consider going to
graduate school at some point in their

33
00:01:43,570 --> 00:01:44,430
careers

34
00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:47,909
especially going into doctoral programs
um

35
00:01:47,909 --> 00:01:51,009
I want to start with a quote I've I've
talked with the number of people both

36
00:01:51,009 --> 00:01:53,500
students faculty perspective students

37
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:56,840
leading up to this talk to get different
people's perspectives intimate right

38
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:57,579
includes

39
00:01:57,579 --> 00:02:01,700
you know verbatim quotes from people
throughout in the first one is from some

40
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:03,700
things to work with who is a former Navy

41
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:07,790
Information Warfare operator he spent 16
years in the Navy

42
00:02:07,790 --> 00:02:11,120
he retired he went to work for a number
I love a

43
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:15,110
love government contracting companies to
support the navy's missions and

44
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:16,230
information warfare

45
00:02:16,230 --> 00:02:19,920
and he's recently started in a PhD
program a remote program where you can

46
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:23,200
we're live in one place but and do your
research there but

47
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:28,069
go to school in another place and he
wrote as an operational hacker

48
00:02:28,069 --> 00:02:31,830
I've always had inquisitive mind I think
that the nature of the entire cyber

49
00:02:31,830 --> 00:02:34,310
industry in landscape lends itself to
folks

50
00:02:34,310 --> 00:02:37,739
who are naturally investigative in their
thinking even though I was trained by

51
00:02:37,739 --> 00:02:38,640
some of the best

52
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:42,830
agencies and technical folks the planet
has to offer I knew that in order to be

53
00:02:42,830 --> 00:02:45,700
really effective in the environment I
would have to learn more

54
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:50,110
a lot more I went to grad school because
honestly I didn't think my BS really

55
00:02:50,110 --> 00:02:53,470
gave me much to work with in regards to
a specific skill skill set

56
00:02:53,470 --> 00:02:57,879
I think the saying your BS teaches you
think your MS teaches you to think

57
00:02:57,879 --> 00:03:01,018
the PhD teaches you to do is absolutely
true

58
00:03:01,019 --> 00:03:04,180
my master's degree was a great way to
begin to think about things as they

59
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:06,080
apply to the area that I wanted to work
in

60
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:09,450
but again it didn't really allow me to
do much for contribute to the body of

61
00:03:09,450 --> 00:03:10,090
knowledge

62
00:03:10,090 --> 00:03:14,000
my peachy is the first degree focused
area that I feels actually given me the

63
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,569
ability to do something

64
00:03:15,569 --> 00:03:19,239
my project is along the lines of mapping
user's digital footprints

65
00:03:19,239 --> 00:03:22,550
and comparing that to likely
exploitation scenarios based on those

66
00:03:22,550 --> 00:03:23,379
footprints

67
00:03:23,379 --> 00:03:26,690
essentially will be an application that
can be used either for offense or

68
00:03:26,690 --> 00:03:27,310
defense

69
00:03:27,310 --> 00:03:30,390
and I think it's going to be a game
changer in the industry bid

70
00:03:30,390 --> 00:03:34,200
only because my PhD studies in the
exposure I've had other PHD's in this

71
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:34,810
area

72
00:03:34,810 --> 00:03:38,540
but I've gained enough real knowledge to
do quality research and contribute to

73
00:03:38,540 --> 00:03:40,629
the body of knowledge as well as my own
project

74
00:03:40,629 --> 00:03:44,670
I could have spent the rest of my career
just doing hacks in exploitation

75
00:03:44,670 --> 00:03:48,170
but I realize that if I wanted to be
really good at it and become a force in

76
00:03:48,170 --> 00:03:48,909
the industry

77
00:03:48,909 --> 00:03:51,970
I needed the deeper understanding and
tools that a graduate-level education

78
00:03:51,970 --> 00:03:53,209
can provide

79
00:03:53,209 --> 00:03:56,920
so that's one hackers motivation for
going to graduate school

80
00:03:56,920 --> 00:04:00,349
choosing an interesting area something
he cares about deeply in creating

81
00:04:00,349 --> 00:04:03,840
elegant solutions to unaddressed
problems in that space

82
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:07,040
more broadly just the other day I was
speaking with another hackers motivation

83
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:07,359
was

84
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:10,769
was was higher levels to spend his time
in his career

85
00:04:10,769 --> 00:04:14,599
doing previously unsolved work that he
finds interesting and stimulating

86
00:04:14,599 --> 00:04:18,070
he said that he hadn't planned enter a
doctoral program but he was working at a

87
00:04:18,070 --> 00:04:22,320
university research lab in enjoying the
research he was doing for the professor

88
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:25,979
um he ended up in rolling the program in
he says when he got out at the doctoral

89
00:04:25,979 --> 00:04:26,880
program his ex

90
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:30,370
certainly extremely well especially in
terms of not having to build up a resume

91
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:31,600
experience

92
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:34,960
what I do I company now is a mix of
sponsored research that's coming from a

93
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:35,698
customer

94
00:04:35,699 --> 00:04:39,590
plus internal research funded by the
company itself basically a programmer is

95
00:04:39,590 --> 00:04:42,460
given a budget and almost complete
independence to pursue

96
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:46,789
my ideas and my choices says he wouldn't
know what the hell he was doing if he

97
00:04:46,790 --> 00:04:47,940
didn't have the gradual

98
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:51,020
graduate school experience both the
fundamentals he learned plus the

99
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:52,710
research experience he got

100
00:04:52,710 --> 00:04:55,340
you feel that having the doctoral
experience gave him the ability to come

101
00:04:55,340 --> 00:04:59,259
in and start doing research within a few
months is starting his job

102
00:04:59,259 --> 00:05:03,979
the talk today is largely based on my
personal experiences I love graduate

103
00:05:03,979 --> 00:05:04,409
school

104
00:05:04,410 --> 00:05:07,590
was it was fascinating use fabulous I

105
00:05:07,590 --> 00:05:11,820
respected my colleagues and loved going
into to work every day

106
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:16,460
I enjoyed the projects those working on
I enjoyed the camaraderie I enjoyed how

107
00:05:16,460 --> 00:05:17,780
much I was learning

108
00:05:17,780 --> 00:05:23,070
um it was it was so far the single most
transformative experience in my life

109
00:05:23,070 --> 00:05:26,539
in terms of who I was before graduate
school in Miami now

110
00:05:26,539 --> 00:05:30,070
now i got married two years ago and so

111
00:05:30,070 --> 00:05:32,449
your ass big in a few years it might
have become the second most

112
00:05:32,449 --> 00:05:35,919
transformative experience my life at
that point

113
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:40,859
Valley tough crowd um joke actually went
over a lot better with my wife and I did

114
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:42,889
with you guys

115
00:05:42,889 --> 00:05:47,669
so Reds who isn't for everybody as now
I'm saying I'm not saying you're

116
00:05:47,669 --> 00:05:51,180
your lesser in your career if you don't
go to graduate school it was just good

117
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:51,930
for me

118
00:05:51,930 --> 00:05:54,820
and that's what I wanted to do with this
talk was to give you some other the

119
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:57,009
perspective of people who have been
through school

120
00:05:57,009 --> 00:06:00,289
and some other perspective the the
faculty members that have hackers on

121
00:06:00,289 --> 00:06:01,250
their team

122
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:04,050
to help you decide whether or not it
might be something you're interested in

123
00:06:04,050 --> 00:06:05,949
looking for

124
00:06:05,949 --> 00:06:11,400
so I have a 5 points that you saw on the
abstract if you read the abstract the

125
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:12,100
TOC

126
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:16,030
a first you get to do what you love
graduate school is different from other

127
00:06:16,030 --> 00:06:17,539
kinds of schooling

128
00:06:17,539 --> 00:06:20,960
especially in your terms love your
ability to influence the work that you

129
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:22,330
do

130
00:06:22,330 --> 00:06:25,719
number two you get to make large
structured contributions to the

131
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:26,650
community

132
00:06:26,650 --> 00:06:30,810
and in many ways you have a greater
chance of people adopting the thing that

133
00:06:30,810 --> 00:06:32,259
you care about her the thing

134
00:06:32,259 --> 00:06:36,080
did and actual use the things that you
create than you might have been other

135
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:37,949
forms

136
00:06:37,949 --> 00:06:41,199
a number three you experience personal
growth while surrounded by amazing

137
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:42,410
people

138
00:06:42,410 --> 00:06:46,850
a that my when the thing that I've said
the most about having been in graduate

139
00:06:46,850 --> 00:06:47,620
school is

140
00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:52,930
is people felt that if if I looked good
right if I was going out give a talk

141
00:06:52,930 --> 00:06:55,990
if I did a good job with that talk it
reflected well on everybody

142
00:06:55,990 --> 00:06:59,470
everybody look good and so what I found
was for everything I did when I write

143
00:06:59,470 --> 00:07:01,660
papers might work on class project no

144
00:07:01,660 --> 00:07:04,979
give external presentations my
colleagues would

145
00:07:04,979 --> 00:07:08,099
would come out of the woodwork they
would want to listen to me in practice

146
00:07:08,099 --> 00:07:11,639
talks they want a white board ideas with
me they would want to

147
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:15,150
to to go over my research plan to make
sure that I had a good before I go into

148
00:07:15,150 --> 00:07:16,310
my committee meetings

149
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:19,930
um and i really miss that camaraderie is
something that I have not found to be

150
00:07:19,930 --> 00:07:23,979
true in the industry jobs they've held
since grad school

151
00:07:23,979 --> 00:07:27,590
number for your part of a meritocracy in
a close-knit social circle

152
00:07:27,590 --> 00:07:31,979
you're really evaluated you in your work
valued on the strength of your ideas

153
00:07:31,979 --> 00:07:36,250
and the rigor viewer execution you can
show up to give a talk at a conference

154
00:07:36,250 --> 00:07:37,349
wearing

155
00:07:37,349 --> 00:07:40,800
assless chaps and studs and and whatever
you want

156
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:44,530
and people are generally going to listen
to what it is that you have to say

157
00:07:44,530 --> 00:07:48,550
and um I do have some pictures later in
the talk that

158
00:07:48,550 --> 00:07:52,099
that are served relevant to this yes um

159
00:07:52,099 --> 00:07:55,740
but a alright so picture one was

160
00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:59,259
you get to experiment a lot in grad
school words this was winter 2000

161
00:07:59,259 --> 00:08:02,190
I'm I went to Carnegie Mellon in
Pittsburgh Pennsylvania winter in

162
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:03,539
pittsburgh is cold

163
00:08:03,539 --> 00:08:06,940
it's not the time to shave your head if
you want to try it out just as criminal

164
00:08:06,940 --> 00:08:07,599
thing

165
00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:11,729
um it it's not good so if you've had
that experience the thing you want is

166
00:08:11,729 --> 00:08:13,449
more hair

167
00:08:13,449 --> 00:08:17,900
um so definitely a time to

168
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:21,440
to to try different things um

169
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:24,479
so you're a valued on the strength
radios that's pretty cool and finally 5

170
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:26,219
the door is open for interesting

171
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:30,379
opportunities afterwards that's both in
terms of that having the degree

172
00:08:30,379 --> 00:08:34,200
opens the door to get a lot of positions
the Arctic to get your resume in the

173
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:35,589
door to get the interviews

174
00:08:35,589 --> 00:08:39,149
but also that the six years and getting
the degree gives you the skills that you

175
00:08:39,149 --> 00:08:41,049
need to succeed in those positions if

176
00:08:41,049 --> 00:08:43,968
you know that's that's what you want
with your career one of the things I

177
00:08:43,969 --> 00:08:45,000
found in particular

178
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:49,000
that was the its it's made it possible
for me to pursue my

179
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,910
my dream at the moment for whatever that
dream was as I was leaving grad school

180
00:08:52,910 --> 00:08:56,709
2004 had a number really cool job
opportunities

181
00:08:56,709 --> 00:09:00,000
are the standard academic thing is to
get a a faculty position somewhere right

182
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,930
to great job offers

183
00:09:01,930 --> 00:09:04,880
one from the University Waterloo in
Canada the other from the University

184
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:06,390
Edinburgh in Scotland

185
00:09:06,390 --> 00:09:10,510
I had some some really interesting
opportunities with the large companies

186
00:09:10,510 --> 00:09:12,939
the couple small companies out in
silicon valley

187
00:09:12,940 --> 00:09:16,209
um I had the obligatory interview with
Google although they did not give me and

188
00:09:16,209 --> 00:09:17,260
our job offer I

189
00:09:17,260 --> 00:09:20,910
interview with Microsoft Research um I
want a management consulting firm to

190
00:09:20,910 --> 00:09:22,810
talk with them about whether they wanted
PHD's

191
00:09:22,810 --> 00:09:26,510
they did but the money

192
00:09:26,510 --> 00:09:29,709
and on the jamming to taking a greater
New York City because

193
00:09:29,709 --> 00:09:32,420
what are the things that I wanted out of
my job was to live in summer really

194
00:09:32,420 --> 00:09:33,250
really cool

195
00:09:33,250 --> 00:09:36,610
and your city it turns out is actually
really really cool I love dont

196
00:09:36,610 --> 00:09:40,190
33rd Street and Park Avenue just on the
other side the Empire State Building

197
00:09:40,190 --> 00:09:43,709
I would hop on the Metro North Railroad
commute up to near White Plains and work

198
00:09:43,709 --> 00:09:45,779
at IBM's TJ Watson Research Center

199
00:09:45,779 --> 00:09:49,899
um I was there for two years and the
other PHD got me there

200
00:09:49,899 --> 00:09:53,510
it got me the job because one of the
members have my dissertation committee

201
00:09:53,510 --> 00:09:56,750
was the manager that I ended up working
for IBM rights for damian

202
00:09:56,750 --> 00:10:00,279
into the company to me they could
directly give my resume to

203
00:10:00,279 --> 00:10:03,490
um it helped me be ready to switch
fields

204
00:10:03,490 --> 00:10:06,800
in graduate school I was a storage
systems researcher we're looking at

205
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:08,390
alternatives to flash

206
00:10:08,390 --> 00:10:11,920
for non-volatile storage that might
replace disk Sunday

207
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:15,149
a little did we know that that flash was
going to be the way that it was we start

208
00:10:15,149 --> 00:10:19,060
looking at 1998 back when flash was
slightly more expensive than it is now

209
00:10:19,060 --> 00:10:22,850
but after six years a grad school n work
on storage anymore I wanna do something

210
00:10:22,850 --> 00:10:23,600
different

211
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:26,720
I started getting into security for my
last year grad school

212
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:30,560
into it got me into the secure systems
group that was doing virtualization

213
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:32,440
research hypervisors

214
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:35,649
trusted platform modules a lot of things
that this community aids

215
00:10:35,649 --> 00:10:40,060
um that it it it enabled me to use or to
get up to speed

216
00:10:40,060 --> 00:10:43,310
and start working and start living
pretty quickly the skills that I got in

217
00:10:43,310 --> 00:10:45,040
graduate school

218
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:48,180
I'm after two years that I decided that
I want to be entrepreneurial

219
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:52,220
um so I moved to arlington virginia to
work for a

220
00:10:52,220 --> 00:10:55,380
11 have many ski government contractors
they worked for since then

221
00:10:55,380 --> 00:10:58,360
I should give a shout out to my current
scheme the government contractor we're

222
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:00,440
not ski Alltel Communications Systems

223
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:03,850
my fabulous job with them they're paying
for me to be here um that's the standard

224
00:11:03,850 --> 00:11:04,600
disclaimer

225
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:07,980
the views expressed in this doctor not
the views at my company generator

226
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:11,300
numb but back to the point

227
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:15,339
um I wanted to be entrepreneurial and
the peach tea help with that as well

228
00:11:15,339 --> 00:11:19,209
to a lot of people take you seriously if
you come up and say I am doctor john

229
00:11:19,209 --> 00:11:22,410
actually other people say that your
doctor john that we don't sound like a

230
00:11:22,410 --> 00:11:25,699
jack off 'em but a it

231
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:28,810
it helped me get a position down there
to help me get taken seriously by

232
00:11:28,810 --> 00:11:29,750
customers

233
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:33,570
arm it helped me you know

234
00:11:33,570 --> 00:11:37,870
the the skills again help me be thrust
into new position trying to do some

235
00:11:37,870 --> 00:11:40,860
project leadership were trying to write
some documents on topics that I didn't

236
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:43,600
know what was it help me get up to speed
on those quickly excedrin help me

237
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:44,649
succeed

238
00:11:44,649 --> 00:11:48,000
later I started my own company it didn't
help me succeed there it will restart

239
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:48,860
the company I

240
00:11:48,860 --> 00:11:52,180
failed after two years it turns out it's
harder to start a business than it looks

241
00:11:52,180 --> 00:11:55,690
um and then it got me the positions that
I have now I'm a part-time research

242
00:11:55,690 --> 00:11:58,740
professor at Johns Hopkins University
with the CS department

243
00:11:58,740 --> 00:12:02,350
a min then I'm full time as a research
fellow at telecommunication systems

244
00:12:02,350 --> 00:12:06,230
I'm the highest-ranking cyber

245
00:12:06,230 --> 00:12:09,920
as we call it engineer inside the
company and so when it comes to us

246
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:12,930
cyber what fiber drink yes

247
00:12:12,930 --> 00:12:16,040
the cyber drink in the company and the
highest-ranking um

248
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:19,219
cyber engineer in the company and so I'm
not a vice president but

249
00:12:19,220 --> 00:12:22,800
when the yesterday another vice
president the company wrote me asking a

250
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:24,480
question about Mobile Security said

251
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:28,589
does the is are there any problems at
Mobile Security right now

252
00:12:28,589 --> 00:12:31,790
and so is well positioned to say yes and
to sort it explain what some others

253
00:12:31,790 --> 00:12:34,160
might be

254
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:38,019
couple other ones a my student that I
worked with previously Brendan O'Connor

255
00:12:38,019 --> 00:12:39,190
sitting appear

256
00:12:39,190 --> 00:12:43,000
brendan has decided to take his master's
degree from computer science in to go

257
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,060
into law school to get a JD juris
doctorate

258
00:12:46,060 --> 00:12:49,310
he'll be telling you all about that on
Sunday I talked until you can't miss

259
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:50,730
contact the law

260
00:12:50,730 --> 00:12:55,560
um and so there's there's a lot of

261
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:58,839
when I was when I was interviewing I
talk to the lotto engineers have been

262
00:12:58,839 --> 00:13:00,700
working for fifteen years

263
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:04,389
and the one thing that the the grad
school doesn't for you doesn't do for

264
00:13:04,389 --> 00:13:07,389
you it doesn't give you a lot of
programming experience if you like to

265
00:13:07,389 --> 00:13:09,600
program you certainly get to program a
bunch

266
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:12,760
but it's not like going to start up in
programming for 80 hours a week

267
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:16,180
in fact some other people that I talked
with business owners um

268
00:13:16,180 --> 00:13:20,820
a startup out in california a small
government contracting business and burr

269
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:25,100
new hampshire um both for those people
were very down on the concept of hiring

270
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:27,670
PHD's they were not interested in me in
particular

271
00:13:27,670 --> 00:13:32,350
but they said that all the PhD is 'cause
used to waste your time for six years

272
00:13:32,350 --> 00:13:35,200
you're going you're not learning how to
code you're not learning good coding

273
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:38,100
techniques you're useless to me and so
why would I hire you

274
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:42,310
um and so there is you know it's not for
everybody if you like your job including

275
00:13:42,310 --> 00:13:47,060
um getting a PhD perhaps can help you
move up the chain become a lead engineer

276
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:49,339
become an architect do this or two
things

277
00:13:49,339 --> 00:13:53,699
but it might not be for every inch by 12
knowledge that

278
00:13:53,699 --> 00:13:57,639
one final person the someone I spoke
with um

279
00:13:57,639 --> 00:14:01,550
said that he's a year Shire 40 he's
considering getting a PhD not

280
00:14:01,550 --> 00:14:04,019
necessarily because he likes PHD's but
because

281
00:14:04,019 --> 00:14:07,589
it sorta career choice for me. says
there's a definite age bias in the CS

282
00:14:07,589 --> 00:14:08,220
world

283
00:14:08,220 --> 00:14:10,990
which is going to start a season one of
the reasons he's been moving away from

284
00:14:10,990 --> 00:14:12,190
soccer engineering

285
00:14:12,190 --> 00:14:16,310
into security in architecture work
beyond the age bias there's also a glass

286
00:14:16,310 --> 00:14:19,029
ceiling that he's found in the showers
and engineers

287
00:14:19,029 --> 00:14:22,060
he enjoys teaching that's what he wants
to do with his PhD

288
00:14:22,060 --> 00:14:25,990
he says while the showers are much less
or the hours and he no longer desires to

289
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:26,779
be a code monkey

290
00:14:26,779 --> 00:14:30,060
he's done it too many times he prefers
figuring out how things should be done

291
00:14:30,060 --> 00:14:34,480
and letting someone else deal with the
mundane deal details %uh implementation

292
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:37,389
to says that he's left with three
possible options verses to get an MBA

293
00:14:37,389 --> 00:14:38,930
move into management

294
00:14:38,930 --> 00:14:42,630
um CT 0 type role which he thinks is
still a strong possibility

295
00:14:42,630 --> 00:14:45,980
seconds to go out on his own consoled
which the PhD would help with the pay is

296
00:14:45,980 --> 00:14:46,610
better

297
00:14:46,610 --> 00:14:49,990
having gray here helps a bit higher
stress and

298
00:14:49,990 --> 00:14:53,790
when the economy is bad there's no work
amore three teach in a small school and

299
00:14:53,790 --> 00:14:56,139
consult on the side is mean plan

300
00:14:56,139 --> 00:14:59,630
the potential for good pay when times
are well in the CTV job in benefits when

301
00:14:59,630 --> 00:15:01,670
times are not so well

302
00:15:01,670 --> 00:15:04,940
that at that point to provide the doors
and open for interesting up to use

303
00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:09,829
afterwards appoint one you get to do you
love

304
00:15:09,829 --> 00:15:12,959
to grad school is different from the
kinda schooling my dad teaches high

305
00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:15,399
school math down Alabama where I grew up

306
00:15:15,399 --> 00:15:19,410
um I've for the last 18 years are gone
and talked with his students

307
00:15:19,410 --> 00:15:22,649
about life after high school what it's
like going to college Woodside

308
00:15:22,649 --> 00:15:25,709
getting a job somewhere that's not
Calhoun County Alabama and moving around

309
00:15:25,709 --> 00:15:26,850
the country

310
00:15:26,850 --> 00:15:31,110
um and won the Masters they give them as
the college is different from high

311
00:15:31,110 --> 00:15:31,769
school

312
00:15:31,769 --> 00:15:35,430
and so college you're supposed to be
learning how to think some places do it

313
00:15:35,430 --> 00:15:38,980
better than others but it's not the rote
memorization boring structured classes

314
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:41,209
that you remember from when you were in
high school

315
00:15:41,209 --> 00:15:45,570
graduate schools even bigger shift one
other faculty members development at

316
00:15:45,570 --> 00:15:47,550
Columbia University of the road

317
00:15:47,550 --> 00:15:51,089
our room you say that a a master's
degree at Columbia takes one and a half

318
00:15:51,089 --> 00:15:52,040
years

319
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:55,459
a peach economy it takes five to six
years but involves the same number of

320
00:15:55,459 --> 00:15:56,410
courses

321
00:15:56,410 --> 00:15:59,930
because the point is that the PhD is an
apprenticeship program in learning how

322
00:15:59,930 --> 00:16:01,190
to do research

323
00:16:01,190 --> 00:16:04,320
from picking a problem to getting the
results published

324
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:07,720
I the idea is that you can um

325
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:11,089
you can figure out what's important to
do what's the what's the problem in 01

326
00:16:11,089 --> 00:16:11,920
solved how

327
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:15,440
are you going to fix it in a way that no
one is all before

328
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:17,970
help you solve it and then tell other
people how to solve the problems that

329
00:16:17,970 --> 00:16:20,050
they can build on those results

330
00:16:20,050 --> 00:16:23,339
um the job is you often

331
00:16:23,339 --> 00:16:26,480
in engineering positions computer
science positions in graduate school

332
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:30,209
your of unpaid either part-time or
full-time I'm doesn't pay well I think

333
00:16:30,209 --> 00:16:33,970
he's usually below the federal poverty
level but you do get a stipend

334
00:16:33,970 --> 00:16:37,060
um it was

335
00:16:37,060 --> 00:16:40,170
rising gradual ten years ago was on the
neighborhood have two thousand dollars a

336
00:16:40,170 --> 00:16:41,339
month

337
00:16:41,339 --> 00:16:44,759
and I think it's gone up a little bit
since then um

338
00:16:44,759 --> 00:16:48,850
you choose the area that you were also
so you'll often have a job as a research

339
00:16:48,850 --> 00:16:52,110
assistantship where you're working for a
faculty member on a project

340
00:16:52,110 --> 00:16:55,360
arm baby being paid from the grant money
that he receives

341
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:59,509
from companies from the government
cetera um you can also have a teaching

342
00:16:59,509 --> 00:17:02,690
assistantship position where in so doing
research you're doing work for the

343
00:17:02,690 --> 00:17:04,289
department grading papers

344
00:17:04,289 --> 00:17:07,559
um delivering some lectures a generous
there's often ways to

345
00:17:07,559 --> 00:17:10,928
to help mitigate the cost the number one
reason to people I talk with why they

346
00:17:10,929 --> 00:17:12,230
don't wanna go to graduate school

347
00:17:12,230 --> 00:17:16,089
is a really like making their salaries
and they have a mortgage in a wife and

348
00:17:16,089 --> 00:17:18,909
they have a new cat that they need to
buy cat food for et cetera

349
00:17:18,910 --> 00:17:21,660
um and it can be really hard to say I'm
going to spend the next six years doing

350
00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:22,919
this thing instead

351
00:17:22,919 --> 00:17:27,160
and there are programs that aren't full
time on site programs %uh the person I

352
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:28,580
mention beginning the talk is

353
00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:32,260
doing a part-time program um into your
mileage may vary you may be able to find

354
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:35,370
a way to make it work in your lifestyle

355
00:17:35,370 --> 00:17:38,600
so you choose the area that work in I
was curious

356
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:41,620
about networks in operating systems
that's what I wanted to do when I went

357
00:17:41,620 --> 00:17:42,630
to grad school

358
00:17:42,630 --> 00:17:45,860
I'm so a guy that was not rating systems
professor and I got hooked up it turns

359
00:17:45,860 --> 00:17:48,950
out he was doing storage systems
elements operating systems

360
00:17:48,950 --> 00:17:52,210
arm and that's where I found what my
passion was which was

361
00:17:52,210 --> 00:17:55,940
the interface storage devices are
blocked devices

362
00:17:55,940 --> 00:18:00,340
operating systems talk with them be a
blocks give me these many blocks back in

363
00:18:00,340 --> 00:18:02,139
yours more blocks to put in

364
00:18:02,140 --> 00:18:04,870
I thought that's domination do something
better we should have some sort of

365
00:18:04,870 --> 00:18:06,640
intelligence across the interface

366
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:10,309
a min so that's what I worked on for the
large part of my six years graduate

367
00:18:10,309 --> 00:18:11,370
school

368
00:18:11,370 --> 00:18:15,480
you define projects that you feel are
important for example my project

369
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:19,100
what are the things that I looked at was
storage based intrusion detection

370
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:22,299
with my colleagues from

371
00:18:22,299 --> 00:18:27,320
using was an idea but I get clean water
credit for it

372
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:30,950
I'm with george bush intrusion detection
we said we've got network IDS is

373
00:18:30,950 --> 00:18:34,669
we've got host ideas is but the desk
sees everything

374
00:18:34,669 --> 00:18:38,020
I the disk as Oliver if someone's gonna
write a rootkit that's gonna persist

375
00:18:38,020 --> 00:18:39,100
after a reboot

376
00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:42,190
they're gonna put on the desk so is
there some way we can put some smarts

377
00:18:42,190 --> 00:18:44,160
and the desk that has memory that has

378
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:48,160
a processor to get it to do smarter
things in terms of finding

379
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:51,320
when malware appears in the may be
responding to that dollars

380
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:55,129
now a man so I was looking at ways that
at this interface level how can we

381
00:18:55,130 --> 00:18:57,130
extended from just a block interface

382
00:18:57,130 --> 00:19:00,400
to more like what an object-based
storage interface looks like today have

383
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:05,870
more information passing back and forth
one of the

384
00:19:05,870 --> 00:19:08,830
what are the cool things about it is AI
was able to build on a lot of other

385
00:19:08,830 --> 00:19:12,189
people's work in particular a smirk on
active discs from

386
00:19:12,190 --> 00:19:15,870
five or 10 years before I was a student
but said things like gee if you've got a

387
00:19:15,870 --> 00:19:18,980
100 discs that are part of a database
and you want to do a query

388
00:19:18,980 --> 00:19:22,260
might distribute agreed on 100 s as
opposed to doing on your you're single

389
00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:22,610
this

390
00:19:22,610 --> 00:19:27,580
after my work some people at Penn State
built on mine to build rootkit resistant

391
00:19:27,580 --> 00:19:28,020
this

392
00:19:28,020 --> 00:19:31,168
I said well that was a good idea so I we
have the

393
00:19:31,169 --> 00:19:34,799
a one they built a prototype is that
when we have a sort a fully functional

394
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:37,700
thing that doesn't need interact with
the operating system provides you the

395
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:39,010
same level

396
00:19:39,010 --> 00:19:42,200
protection was fun being part that are
rate that was actually pretty cool

397
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:44,090
seeing people use my ideas

398
00:19:44,090 --> 00:19:47,199
I have on average one person per year

399
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:51,309
who contact me by email about something
in my dissertation um

400
00:19:51,309 --> 00:19:54,610
they will I was the world's foremost
expert on

401
00:19:54,610 --> 00:19:58,880
target mode operation for when action
FreeBSD for a few years that is if you

402
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:00,970
want to plug one computer to another
computer

403
00:20:00,970 --> 00:20:04,480
over a scuzzy by survivor Jenna was
never pretend to be a storage device

404
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:08,039
tell you it um and so I still have
people writing me about that it's nice

405
00:20:08,039 --> 00:20:09,620
to be able to give back to the community

406
00:20:09,620 --> 00:20:12,929
it's nice that they're able to read my
dissertation and see what my approach

407
00:20:12,929 --> 00:20:14,530
was with the state of the art was

408
00:20:14,530 --> 00:20:19,110
is nice people to help people with the
continuing work like that aspect

409
00:20:19,110 --> 00:20:22,580
are used in the time in the way you want
you to find quality feel are important

410
00:20:22,580 --> 00:20:26,530
a oftentimes our new time card one other
students that I worked with

411
00:20:26,530 --> 00:20:29,710
Eric at Johns Hopkins um

412
00:20:29,710 --> 00:20:34,090
team to travel every week he was on all
that the plan level plans

413
00:20:34,090 --> 00:20:36,860
and it just worked for the schedule
right if there was a a conference coming

414
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:38,600
up for paper deadline he wouldn't travel

415
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:42,230
otherwise he had the flexibility to go
when he wanted to use as long as it

416
00:20:42,230 --> 00:20:45,380
didn't impact as research group um

417
00:20:45,380 --> 00:20:50,309
so it's pretty exciting um one of those
professors Fabian Monrose at

418
00:20:50,309 --> 00:20:53,240
the University of North Carolina I spoke
with said that as long as you're

419
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:54,450
speaking to us

420
00:20:54,450 --> 00:20:58,530
group security people security minded
people he teaches security forces and

421
00:20:58,530 --> 00:21:00,260
suggest to his students that they not

422
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:03,890
study security if they go to graduate
school to the instead find something

423
00:21:03,890 --> 00:21:06,559
that sorted the next evolution of what
they want to be if your engine

424
00:21:06,559 --> 00:21:10,389
operating systems instead in compiler
designed to prevent

425
00:21:10,390 --> 00:21:13,929
execution a bad cold or whatever that
that graduate school can be that

426
00:21:13,929 --> 00:21:14,789
opportunity

427
00:21:14,789 --> 00:21:17,919
to branch out from what you've been
doing into some new area that you're

428
00:21:17,919 --> 00:21:21,380
interested in doing

429
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:24,740
to other faculty I know this is boring
I'm sorry it's I'd

430
00:21:24,740 --> 00:21:28,000
I thought I was gonna be a thirty minute
talking is an hour talking so my stuff

431
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,380
in a bunch materials I guess

432
00:21:29,380 --> 00:21:33,860
like speak really um Margo seltzer

433
00:21:33,860 --> 00:21:37,480
at a Harvard said that hackers should
come if you're in a job where there's

434
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:40,250
always open questions that you don't
have time to answer

435
00:21:40,250 --> 00:21:45,059
mess the aspect to graduate school it's
not the and I DM you had two days to

436
00:21:45,059 --> 00:21:47,710
figure out how you're going architected
in you build it and it was going to be

437
00:21:47,710 --> 00:21:49,070
like that for the rest of all time

438
00:21:49,070 --> 00:21:52,580
rebuilt was gonna go in the product and
so you had to make the best yes and make

439
00:21:52,580 --> 00:21:54,090
it work and hope that it worked

440
00:21:54,090 --> 00:21:57,389
I'm hope that someone didn't have to
come back clean it up after you um

441
00:21:57,390 --> 00:22:00,400
in grad school you don't have that kind
of a deadline if you wait too long

442
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:03,549
someone else will do you work for you
and publisher you want to switch topics

443
00:22:03,549 --> 00:22:07,139
um but you can say there's three
different ways that we could solve this

444
00:22:07,140 --> 00:22:09,590
problem you do all three of them and see
which ones best in test

445
00:22:09,590 --> 00:22:13,780
exhaustively everybody will know the
answer this question

446
00:22:13,780 --> 00:22:17,389
finally the fact remember Carnegie
Mellon who taught the most difficult

447
00:22:17,390 --> 00:22:19,000
course I'd ever taken

448
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:22,110
it was so difficult but I just gave up
after two weeks and

449
00:22:22,110 --> 00:22:25,409
drop to the classes um

450
00:22:25,409 --> 00:22:28,750
she wrote that there's four things in
her students that

451
00:22:28,750 --> 00:22:31,980
that she's fine she finds that people
like one is that

452
00:22:31,980 --> 00:22:35,830
joy discovering the joints covering
something new that no one knew about

453
00:22:35,830 --> 00:22:39,658
there's the joint truly understanding
I'm getting past that point where people

454
00:22:39,659 --> 00:22:40,860
say alright the rest

455
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:43,870
this is beyond the scope of this
discussion in Scopus book you can

456
00:22:43,870 --> 00:22:47,860
going to that level work there's the joy
doing it right as i just described not

457
00:22:47,860 --> 00:22:48,679
having to

458
00:22:48,679 --> 00:22:52,679
you know get everything done in in two
minutes um and that some people relish

459
00:22:52,679 --> 00:22:54,100
the joy of being the authority

460
00:22:54,100 --> 00:22:57,250
or the joy of having their work side by
Others it really is actually really cool

461
00:22:57,250 --> 00:22:57,820
to see

462
00:22:57,820 --> 00:23:02,360
were driven next to someone else's in
someone's

463
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:06,830
was two citations that spring

464
00:23:06,830 --> 00:23:11,678
right we go you to make large structured
contributions to community

465
00:23:11,679 --> 00:23:14,669
and that you have a greater chance of
people adopting the thing you care about

466
00:23:14,669 --> 00:23:15,549
actually using

467
00:23:15,549 --> 00:23:19,530
you create I think there's two factors
to this one is that you have a larger

468
00:23:19,530 --> 00:23:20,340
soapbox

469
00:23:20,340 --> 00:23:24,830
on which to stand and proclaim your
ideas um when you publish a conference

470
00:23:24,830 --> 00:23:28,600
you generally it's it's not quite I to
the the

471
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:32,169
to get into hope I said a paragraph and
some mysterious

472
00:23:32,169 --> 00:23:35,799
Program Committee somewhere involved in
2600 picked me in

473
00:23:35,799 --> 00:23:39,270
and pick me in the slot and said go I'm
if you're going to publish in an

474
00:23:39,270 --> 00:23:40,650
academic conference

475
00:23:40,650 --> 00:23:43,760
um you submit several months in advance

476
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:48,250
usually tend to talk page manuscript its
evaluated by a program committee

477
00:23:48,250 --> 00:23:51,360
love 20 30 40 different people that are

478
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:55,460
that are sorted well-known people in the
field people have published in that

479
00:23:55,460 --> 00:23:57,240
conference before other well-known

480
00:23:57,240 --> 00:24:00,809
personalities um your work will be
reviewed by

481
00:24:00,809 --> 00:24:04,870
4567 have those people you get back
detailed comments on what they like and

482
00:24:04,870 --> 00:24:06,860
what they didn't like about your work

483
00:24:06,860 --> 00:24:10,610
um if it's published its in libraries
around the world

484
00:24:10,610 --> 00:24:14,320
rest all timers on the ACM's website
early at ripley's website

485
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:18,549
um and its

486
00:24:18,549 --> 00:24:22,820
its known by others in reference by
others and used by others incited by the

487
00:24:22,820 --> 00:24:23,460
others and

488
00:24:23,460 --> 00:24:27,140
built upon by others um and thats

489
00:24:27,140 --> 00:24:31,020
I this is my fourth hacker convention
that I've been I want a black end up on

490
00:24:31,020 --> 00:24:31,940
last year

491
00:24:31,940 --> 00:24:34,950
I went to Shrek on earlier this year
bennett hope this year

492
00:24:34,950 --> 00:24:37,570
i'd like them all they're very
interesting they're great talks a lot

493
00:24:37,570 --> 00:24:38,270
agree

494
00:24:38,270 --> 00:24:42,900
you know cool hacks that people done and
I so far haven't really seen longevity

495
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:47,059
every so often Zemel reference some cool
thing from Def Con 12

496
00:24:47,059 --> 00:24:50,190
um but I don't see work that's building
on other people's work

497
00:24:50,190 --> 00:24:54,110
I don't see sort of larger problems
getting solved I see in a lot of cases

498
00:24:54,110 --> 00:24:57,390
hey I this cool idea three weeks before
the submission deadline let's see if we

499
00:24:57,390 --> 00:24:58,179
can get accepted

500
00:24:58,179 --> 00:25:01,650
we got accepted now see if I can make
that cool idea work a min

501
00:25:01,650 --> 00:25:05,039
either way we're going to present it so
I'm there's a difference between the 2i

502
00:25:05,039 --> 00:25:07,039
think both community service things

503
00:25:07,039 --> 00:25:10,650
but if you've never been exposed the
academic communities before

504
00:25:10,650 --> 00:25:14,150
there are sort of special interest
publications on whatever topic that you

505
00:25:14,150 --> 00:25:14,610
like

506
00:25:14,610 --> 00:25:18,320
if you're interested in machine learning
artificial intelligence

507
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:21,450
compiler design security there's lots of
security group

508
00:25:21,450 --> 00:25:25,049
um take a look go and a find

509
00:25:25,049 --> 00:25:27,529
wanted the conference publications from
this year if you're having trouble

510
00:25:27,529 --> 00:25:28,150
finding

511
00:25:28,150 --> 00:25:31,390
thing to me you know I'll be happy to
help you out ominous read through them

512
00:25:31,390 --> 00:25:33,409
and see if you like what you see

513
00:25:33,409 --> 00:25:36,750
if you do they'll find somebody like me

514
00:25:36,750 --> 00:25:40,919
and think about trying to do some work
in that space if you really like it

515
00:25:40,919 --> 00:25:44,610
think about maybe going to graduate
school doing what we're in its place

516
00:25:44,610 --> 00:25:48,640
so the two factors to getting to make
large church organizations one was the

517
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:51,669
larger soap box in which to stay in
providing ideas

518
00:25:51,669 --> 00:25:55,090
i'm too as the rigorous methodology that
you have to follow

519
00:25:55,090 --> 00:25:58,900
in pursuing in publishing your work us
development again from columbia

520
00:25:58,900 --> 00:26:03,220
states that by today's academic
standards a good hack may not be a good

521
00:26:03,220 --> 00:26:03,860
paper

522
00:26:03,860 --> 00:26:07,020
something that's only simple matter
programming isn't enough

523
00:26:07,020 --> 00:26:11,158
it has to teach something reasonably new
or has to be part of a larger project

524
00:26:11,159 --> 00:26:12,559
that does that

525
00:26:12,559 --> 00:26:16,178
one thing the learn in a PhD programs
how to write papers

526
00:26:16,179 --> 00:26:19,100
he says that with newer student he spent
a lot of time showing them what needs to

527
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:21,230
be there but structurally in terms of
content

528
00:26:21,230 --> 00:26:27,820
to sort of get them up to speed on that
topic or on that capability

529
00:26:27,820 --> 00:26:31,330
number three you experience personal
growth

530
00:26:31,330 --> 00:26:34,740
surrounded by amazing people this is my
favorite aspect having been to graduate

531
00:26:34,740 --> 00:26:35,279
school we've

532
00:26:35,279 --> 00:26:38,880
we would my friends that that I was in
school with

533
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:43,059
every day for lunch we would go out and
grab lunch and some other trucks that

534
00:26:43,059 --> 00:26:45,740
were around turning on Pittsburgh we'll
get together

535
00:26:45,740 --> 00:26:49,279
and in 10 summaries come up with the top

536
00:26:49,279 --> 00:26:53,370
right election 2012 whatever it was and
we would spend the rest of the

537
00:26:53,370 --> 00:26:56,610
hour debating that topic everybody would
take a different position

538
00:26:56,610 --> 00:27:00,230
didn't matter because their position it
was just find an insightful and engaging

539
00:27:00,230 --> 00:27:02,150
an intriguing in its sole

540
00:27:02,150 --> 00:27:05,380
just exciting to spend time around
people that were

541
00:27:05,380 --> 00:27:09,279
as motivated as enthusiastic about what
they were doing and I was

542
00:27:09,279 --> 00:27:12,380
a that was really really cool

543
00:27:12,380 --> 00:27:16,610
um you get a great relationship with
your advisor

544
00:27:16,610 --> 00:27:20,820
there's a

545
00:27:20,820 --> 00:27:23,730
most in the adviser advised the
relationships that I've seen work out

546
00:27:23,730 --> 00:27:24,600
really well

547
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:27,570
for ones that aren't it turns out you
can switch back to leave you need to and

548
00:27:27,570 --> 00:27:29,908
so they're sort of know you're not stuck
for six years now

549
00:27:29,909 --> 00:27:34,029
word word type situation um one of the

550
00:27:34,029 --> 00:27:37,690
Randal burns a professor Johns Hopkins

551
00:27:37,690 --> 00:27:41,299
talked with me for a while about the
relationship between the pieces

552
00:27:41,299 --> 00:27:44,309
on the student the advisor in the
community right with the

553
00:27:44,309 --> 00:27:47,870
with the advisers role is is to channel
the student's interests

554
00:27:47,870 --> 00:27:51,309
if you're interested in this this
interface between the operating system

555
00:27:51,309 --> 00:27:55,120
and the storage device he wants to find
a way that you can make that work

556
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:59,149
palatable to the community you succeed
the there's the phrase publisher pairs

557
00:27:59,149 --> 00:28:00,590
are you succeed in academia

558
00:28:00,590 --> 00:28:03,740
by publishing papers at conferences and
so if you're going to publish papers a

559
00:28:03,740 --> 00:28:05,549
good conference as you need to do work

560
00:28:05,549 --> 00:28:09,049
that's on topics that the conferences
are think that think are hot and you

561
00:28:09,049 --> 00:28:11,020
need to do good work at that work

562
00:28:11,020 --> 00:28:15,240
and and so the advisor job is to to
build you up to that point

563
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:19,210
right you're alive effort for them the
first year and by your three you should

564
00:28:19,210 --> 00:28:22,120
be a very small amount of effort by your
five you should be nurturing

565
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:26,110
new graduate student yourself which is
or the arc that I've seen happen in most

566
00:28:26,110 --> 00:28:27,000
cases

567
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:30,059
um an exciting to have that one on one
roll

568
00:28:30,059 --> 00:28:33,750
you going to college you you might have
had a chance to talk with him

569
00:28:33,750 --> 00:28:37,230
your professors and you might have had a
chance to go to their office hours and

570
00:28:37,230 --> 00:28:40,690
and learn more about what they did maybe
got a letter of recommendation from them

571
00:28:40,690 --> 00:28:44,470
um in graduate school its your boss is
not your boss boss

572
00:28:44,470 --> 00:28:48,169
inserted your adviser just four years

573
00:28:48,169 --> 00:28:51,210
but your meeting with them an hour a
week for happy hour a week or something

574
00:28:51,210 --> 00:28:54,370
like that he's very involved in what
you're doing is very interested in your

575
00:28:54,370 --> 00:28:58,640
in your plans he's very interested in in
seeing where your work is going it's a

576
00:28:58,640 --> 00:28:59,980
great relationship I

577
00:28:59,980 --> 00:29:03,049
um my advisors

578
00:29:03,049 --> 00:29:06,350
was professor Greg anger at at CMU is
one the most amazing people I've ever

579
00:29:06,350 --> 00:29:07,020
met

580
00:29:07,020 --> 00:29:10,490
and I just learned a tremendous amount
from him man i've

581
00:29:10,490 --> 00:29:14,450
I found those people in industry when I
was working in Arlington

582
00:29:14,450 --> 00:29:18,279
doctor Greg Frazier the chief scientist
the organization knows what he was like

583
00:29:18,279 --> 00:29:19,130
that

584
00:29:19,130 --> 00:29:23,140
um at my current organization my boss
who's paying for me to be here

585
00:29:23,140 --> 00:29:26,659
I drew i think is going to watch this
video um now he's like that

586
00:29:26,659 --> 00:29:29,330
I hope he's not watching this video
although this will help on my hand over

587
00:29:29,330 --> 00:29:30,389
coming up

588
00:29:30,390 --> 00:29:34,080
I'm but that was nice right that was
part of his job

589
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:37,399
you know he wanted to get good research
Academy because you know he needs to

590
00:29:37,399 --> 00:29:38,600
publish repairs also

591
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:41,950
but he wanted to see me succeed you
wanted see all the students succeed

592
00:29:41,950 --> 00:29:48,950
um and it's nice having someone reading
for you like that

593
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:52,790
you

594
00:29:52,790 --> 00:29:59,790
my you most certainly many

595
00:29:59,799 --> 00:30:03,149
I'm even notice so

596
00:30:03,149 --> 00:30:06,489
I'm a big proponent figuring out how to
hack

597
00:30:06,489 --> 00:30:10,470
education I'm wondering how this is any
different than living life to the

598
00:30:10,470 --> 00:30:10,989
fullest

599
00:30:10,989 --> 00:30:15,179
outside an educational institution thank
you actually hunt down the people that

600
00:30:15,179 --> 00:30:18,509
are amazing what they do and ask for
their time and their good people and so

601
00:30:18,509 --> 00:30:19,200
they give it

602
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:23,279
II wanna hear about what you actually
got

603
00:30:23,279 --> 00:30:26,549
being in school not have gotten anywhere
else

604
00:30:26,549 --> 00:30:30,759
exactly

605
00:30:30,759 --> 00:30:37,759
that's a really good question um

606
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:42,400
I would the first thing that comes to
mind is

607
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:48,480
access so being in the

608
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:51,570
to its if if you if you take

609
00:30:51,570 --> 00:30:56,149
any of the speakers here at Hope um and
you write to them and say hey I would

610
00:30:56,150 --> 00:30:57,830
like to talk with you about to be tax

611
00:30:57,830 --> 00:31:01,050
you're going to have a 99 percent chance
to those people writing back right and

612
00:31:01,050 --> 00:31:02,139
you're going to be able to have

613
00:31:02,140 --> 00:31:06,320
interesting conversations like that um
be in graduate school was

614
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:10,429
was almost a little bit like a forcing
function I'm it was

615
00:31:10,430 --> 00:31:13,580
being surrounded by a lot of people like
that

616
00:31:13,580 --> 00:31:17,060
on a weekly basis um we would have

617
00:31:17,060 --> 00:31:21,970
a I can email me we generally have
seminars every week where external

618
00:31:21,970 --> 00:31:24,090
speakers will be coming in they would
either be

619
00:31:24,090 --> 00:31:27,600
preparing for giving a conference
stockings they begin practice talk so

620
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:27,920
that

621
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:31,150
they be applying for faculty positions
they be

622
00:31:31,150 --> 00:31:36,280
you know getting getting ready to give
their defend their dissertation looking

623
00:31:36,280 --> 00:31:37,950
for jobs the sort of thing

624
00:31:37,950 --> 00:31:41,560
I'm interviewed you would get the
regular interactions with

625
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:46,510
um with your faculty member and with
other faculty members that worked with

626
00:31:46,510 --> 00:31:49,790
him so in addition to Greg there were
four or five faculty that I would

627
00:31:49,790 --> 00:31:53,830
see regularly in the hallways and talk
with under all my colleagues they work

628
00:31:53,830 --> 00:31:55,270
with the senior graduate student

629
00:31:55,270 --> 00:31:59,120
there are these people are coming in
from outside um and there was the fact

630
00:31:59,120 --> 00:31:59,610
that

631
00:31:59,610 --> 00:32:03,830
that the that I would go to several
conferences a year paid for completely

632
00:32:03,830 --> 00:32:05,790
by the school right harder to get

633
00:32:05,790 --> 00:32:09,740
some companies to do that and so the
opportunities for it

634
00:32:09,740 --> 00:32:14,420
were pervasive right you were you didn't
have to go seek somebody out rate you

635
00:32:14,420 --> 00:32:15,140
didn't have to

636
00:32:15,140 --> 00:32:18,570
to take the initiative yourself it just
sort of happened for you um

637
00:32:18,570 --> 00:32:22,850
there's one other the small business
owner

638
00:32:22,850 --> 00:32:26,580
Jason in new hampshire that I spoke with
one other people it was really down on

639
00:32:26,580 --> 00:32:27,409
PHD's

640
00:32:27,410 --> 00:32:31,760
I'm he had he asked me sort the same
question you know why

641
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:35,830
why would you bother spending six years
if you're like doing this

642
00:32:35,830 --> 00:32:40,300
win you know you can do your job and
then spin your heartbeat I'm

643
00:32:40,300 --> 00:32:43,860
doing that sort of thing going to
conferences talking with people calling

644
00:32:43,860 --> 00:32:45,280
people are random and

645
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:50,310
meeting with them in touch I'm I I'm not
going to stand up here in claim that its

646
00:32:50,310 --> 00:32:54,950
it's not possible to do it that way um
it's something that

647
00:32:54,950 --> 00:32:59,060
that you would you have to dedicate
yourself doing anything for it to happen

648
00:32:59,060 --> 00:32:59,730
effectively

649
00:32:59,730 --> 00:33:02,750
um I've met a lot of interesting people
at conferences but

650
00:33:02,750 --> 00:33:06,550
it wasn't like the immersion that I got
writers will set my short answer

651
00:33:06,550 --> 00:33:10,129
um is the immersion aspect the chance to

652
00:33:10,130 --> 00:33:14,430
the chance to be having to have that be
your full-time job

653
00:33:14,430 --> 00:33:18,120
you know to improve yourself as opposed
to having some other full-time job in

654
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:19,560
trying to improve yourself on the side

655
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:23,470
I think that's one aspect I B delighted
to talk more about it afterwards

656
00:33:23,470 --> 00:33:26,720
thanks for the question um

657
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:31,380
number for your party I finished three
yes before your part in a meritocracy in

658
00:33:31,380 --> 00:33:32,670
a close-knit social circle

659
00:33:32,670 --> 00:33:36,400
um you're surrounded by like-minded
people it tends to blur where your hobby

660
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:37,780
inns in your work begins

661
00:33:37,780 --> 00:33:42,840
you you you generally some other the
people I talk with specially 11 graduate

662
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:45,090
student that had been really struggling
in his program

663
00:33:45,090 --> 00:33:48,880
if you come in with with knowing exactly
what it is you want to do I want to

664
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:49,700
build this

665
00:33:49,700 --> 00:33:52,850
tool sometimes that doesn't work very
well

666
00:33:52,850 --> 00:33:57,960
right sometimes um notes your advisor
isn't interested in the other probably

667
00:33:57,960 --> 00:33:59,430
let you do it but there

668
00:33:59,430 --> 00:34:03,080
they're just not as engaged in it is
they could be um sometimes it's going to

669
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:03,800
be harder to get

670
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:06,780
outside people engaged in the things
you're doing and to be able to publish

671
00:34:06,780 --> 00:34:07,560
the work

672
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:10,850
um sometimes it's difficult to get the

673
00:34:10,850 --> 00:34:15,069
advising are devising the the funding
agencies interested in your topic

674
00:34:15,070 --> 00:34:18,159
want the students at work with David the

675
00:34:18,159 --> 00:34:21,850
switched to batch processing the end of
his

676
00:34:21,850 --> 00:34:24,980
his time you know the great job at
Google is doing fabulously he said

677
00:34:24,980 --> 00:34:28,139
I don't want to do storage system that I
want to do the stuff you guys should be

678
00:34:28,139 --> 00:34:29,408
doing I want to work on

679
00:34:29,409 --> 00:34:33,570
scheduling for batch processing systems
he set up a kinder cluster

680
00:34:33,570 --> 00:34:37,110
did everybody's would've looked at him
and said that looks really fabulous

681
00:34:37,110 --> 00:34:42,380
and and um he made a a nice contribution
and it was done in isolation the

682
00:34:42,380 --> 00:34:46,159
the had to sort of put it on his own as
opposed to coming in saying hey I really

683
00:34:46,159 --> 00:34:47,290
want to work on

684
00:34:47,290 --> 00:34:51,630
getting my case um store systems
operating systems networking

685
00:34:51,630 --> 00:34:55,399
these kinds of things in being able to
find a topic that match

686
00:34:55,399 --> 00:34:59,000
my interest plus the interest to the
group plus the ongoing work at the group

687
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:02,700
plus the funding that the group was
getting extra

688
00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:06,870
um where my my nose um

689
00:35:06,870 --> 00:35:11,029
I mention the meritocracy earlier that
it's the case both inside and outside

690
00:35:11,030 --> 00:35:12,390
the school environment if you

691
00:35:12,390 --> 00:35:16,600
if you submit a paper for publication at
a conference oftentimes you're required

692
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:18,220
to non-majors admission

693
00:35:18,220 --> 00:35:21,040
you don't get put your name on it you
don't get the reference any in the

694
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:23,630
previous work you've done you can
reference it though it

695
00:35:23,630 --> 00:35:26,890
as though somebody else to britain at
done it um

696
00:35:26,890 --> 00:35:29,830
you don't mention what school year at or
anything because the conference wants to

697
00:35:29,830 --> 00:35:33,049
accept the work on the quality the work
not on the quality of who you are

698
00:35:33,050 --> 00:35:36,260
I'm in so if you're not in the top 15
school

699
00:35:36,260 --> 00:35:39,470
um and you have a great idea to do a
good job with that you have

700
00:35:39,470 --> 00:35:43,300
as good a chance to giving a published
as as people it other schools do

701
00:35:43,300 --> 00:35:46,780
or another you act industrial and
replaces like that which is a really

702
00:35:46,780 --> 00:35:47,470
cool

703
00:35:47,470 --> 00:35:51,560
aspect of it when you stand up at the
interview or six years there and if in

704
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:52,730
your dissertation

705
00:35:52,730 --> 00:35:57,860
um your dissertation is a is a novel
contribution

706
00:35:57,860 --> 00:36:03,310
to the art aid in my case the the core
of my dissertation was

707
00:36:03,310 --> 00:36:07,880
let's say we had storage systems that
didn't exist yet rated right now you can

708
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:10,380
build a 15,000 rpm disk

709
00:36:10,380 --> 00:36:13,820
you can't build a 30,000 rpm this but
what we wanted to evaluate

710
00:36:13,820 --> 00:36:16,930
I want everyone to see how well that
worked they're gonna make my

711
00:36:16,930 --> 00:36:18,049
dissertation is

712
00:36:18,050 --> 00:36:21,590
you either at this into a back in the
envelope calculation alright if I have

713
00:36:21,590 --> 00:36:25,130
twice as fast as this may be my database
will run twice as fast

714
00:36:25,130 --> 00:36:29,170
on the other side you can use full
system simulation you'll get the same

715
00:36:29,170 --> 00:36:30,910
west to or from 10 years ago and

716
00:36:30,910 --> 00:36:34,140
and build an entire simulation model the
entire computer and run everything

717
00:36:34,140 --> 00:36:37,220
inside that whatever level fidelity you
can do

718
00:36:37,220 --> 00:36:40,770
my argument was there's there's room for
something else we can do this

719
00:36:40,770 --> 00:36:44,870
this plug a computer in another computer
thing that age ride earlier

720
00:36:44,870 --> 00:36:48,299
have this computer be running the
simulator a simulation model the disk

721
00:36:48,300 --> 00:36:51,360
drives like crank up the simulation
parameters to 30,000

722
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:54,580
inhabit respond to requests just like a
30,000 rpm disk

723
00:36:54,580 --> 00:36:58,750
good and now I can run a real
application on a real operating system

724
00:36:58,750 --> 00:37:01,770
on the side the only thing that's fake
is my simulated s

725
00:37:01,770 --> 00:37:05,750
and I can get real results for the
closer's definition real that I can get

726
00:37:05,750 --> 00:37:06,930
into that was

727
00:37:06,930 --> 00:37:10,190
that was my contribution to the field

728
00:37:10,190 --> 00:37:13,090
was the fact that there's this new way
that you can evaluate and do cool things

729
00:37:13,090 --> 00:37:14,370
with

730
00:37:14,370 --> 00:37:17,779
storage systems across this interface
that's in the middle um

731
00:37:17,780 --> 00:37:20,410
in the way that I work was evaluated was
they didn't look at me and say well

732
00:37:20,410 --> 00:37:21,740
you've been here for six years nearly

733
00:37:21,740 --> 00:37:25,110
did you did find your glasses and you're
a good guy ready to go

734
00:37:25,110 --> 00:37:28,830
my committee grilled me and really dug
into

735
00:37:28,830 --> 00:37:31,980
the claims they made my dissertation in
the the work they did in fact

736
00:37:31,980 --> 00:37:34,680
I did engage with them for a year and a
half before and to make sure that they

737
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:36,759
were on board with what it was that I
was doing

738
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:40,170
I'm so that by the time that I finished
my dissertation they felt that it was

739
00:37:40,170 --> 00:37:42,300
work that was worthy of being granted

740
00:37:42,300 --> 00:37:47,220
a degree for um and I was evaluated on
the strength of the work

741
00:37:47,220 --> 00:37:50,690
right again the meritocracy ISO

742
00:37:50,690 --> 00:37:53,820
several factly how to get in how to
hackers get into graduate school

743
00:37:53,820 --> 00:37:54,980
specifically

744
00:37:54,980 --> 00:37:58,360
Margo seltzer from harvard's at I'm love
hackers I was

745
00:37:58,360 --> 00:38:01,290
really delighted by that response he
said that if you can build things in

746
00:38:01,290 --> 00:38:04,100
than you were able to ask interesting
impactful questions

747
00:38:04,100 --> 00:38:08,350
and that's the kind of thing that that
she in fact remembers like-for-like

748
00:38:08,350 --> 00:38:13,279
Angeles carried us who's also a Columbia
I definitely look for hacker qualities

749
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:14,900
and students that I consider

750
00:38:14,900 --> 00:38:17,890
usually a take on students were directly
recommended to me by someone who has

751
00:38:17,890 --> 00:38:18,600
worked with them

752
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:22,080
and who can point to some piece of work
usually open source software

753
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:25,990
that I can look at or play with this was
definitely the case for him for example

754
00:38:25,990 --> 00:38:27,860
prior to going to graduate school he had

755
00:38:27,860 --> 00:38:31,410
authored berries IP sec related
components and stacks and during grad

756
00:38:31,410 --> 00:38:32,859
school he was a major contributor

757
00:38:32,860 --> 00:38:37,120
to OpenBSD said he wasn't all that great
with courses he found to be born most

758
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:39,720
the time except for those that ball
programming

759
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:43,450
I'm so he sort of understand if you're
coming from a not so strong

760
00:38:43,450 --> 00:38:47,020
background there the most important
qualities he looks for resellers

761
00:38:47,020 --> 00:38:51,160
are in prospective grad students are a
demonstrable curiosity which

762
00:38:51,160 --> 00:38:54,190
everyone here has in spades and be
coding

763
00:38:54,190 --> 00:38:57,300
computing aptitude you know it when you
see it he says

764
00:38:57,300 --> 00:39:00,340
kernel hacking skills aren't actual
indication such at least for the kinda

765
00:39:00,340 --> 00:39:02,440
research he doesn't he likes

766
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:05,520
you notice that students are also
expected to pass into reasonably well in

767
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:06,390
their courses

768
00:39:06,390 --> 00:39:09,620
there is an academic cracks aspect
graduate schools who is also looking for

769
00:39:09,620 --> 00:39:10,850
students who want having

770
00:39:10,850 --> 00:39:14,799
have trouble passing those courses and
he agreed with the

771
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:18,390
an assertion I made to him which is that
it's definitely a case

772
00:39:18,390 --> 00:39:22,490
a finding a perspective advisor that
does the same kinda research

773
00:39:22,490 --> 00:39:26,850
that you find attractive you shouldn't
try to pick in graduate school by

774
00:39:26,850 --> 00:39:31,370
school i'd you can applied to the top
five or top 15 or whatever it is that

775
00:39:31,370 --> 00:39:32,430
you want to do

776
00:39:32,430 --> 00:39:36,410
but when you get admitted to the program
your going to be working with

777
00:39:36,410 --> 00:39:40,000
a faculty member or maybe two or three
in some cases

778
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:43,300
you're going to be working in that line
every search

779
00:39:43,300 --> 00:39:46,160
with the other students in his team it's
like a job interview with a particular

780
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:48,460
group sure you might go interview at

781
00:39:48,460 --> 00:39:51,760
Microsoft Research you're going to be
working on the team that brought you

782
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:52,670
being

783
00:39:52,670 --> 00:39:56,370
a min so you need to make sure you like
being and you like we're being is going

784
00:39:56,370 --> 00:39:58,370
in that you want to work to make that
happen

785
00:39:58,370 --> 00:40:01,799
in graduate school is really no
different from that it's your

786
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:06,810
your taking a position with an advisor
to do work with that adviser

787
00:40:06,810 --> 00:40:10,020
final for Margo seltzer how to get and
find someone who

788
00:40:10,020 --> 00:40:14,240
understands what you do in your current
job for your current work right now

789
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:17,780
how to take what you've done and
translated into experiences that

790
00:40:17,780 --> 00:40:20,150
translate in the academic language

791
00:40:20,150 --> 00:40:23,150
somebody who can explain to an academic

792
00:40:23,150 --> 00:40:26,630
who you are and where you want to be so

793
00:40:26,630 --> 00:40:31,310
I am 15 minutes early which is amazing
it took me 52 minutes

794
00:40:31,310 --> 00:40:34,310
last night to give the practice version
the stock which is nice

795
00:40:34,310 --> 00:40:38,420
I'm grad school is great I what did and
I would be happy to answer more

796
00:40:38,420 --> 00:40:42,280
questions on why you might love it too

797
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:49,280
if there are any

798
00:40:49,820 --> 00:40:53,790
you actually a question I'm I I'm
convinced by a lot away he said

799
00:40:53,790 --> 00:40:56,900
I i don't think I'm there right now but
I think I might be at some point but I

800
00:40:56,900 --> 00:40:57,940
have not gone to college

801
00:40:57,940 --> 00:41:01,570
I don't have a degree on how would you

802
00:41:01,570 --> 00:41:05,460
DD would you say about undergraduate
programs like it hello how would you get

803
00:41:05,460 --> 00:41:06,410
the most out of it

804
00:41:06,410 --> 00:41:10,779
it is you goal and you have to go
through it it to do this

805
00:41:10,780 --> 00:41:15,760
generally speaking yes you you are
usually expected to have an

806
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:18,530
undergraduate degree to get admitted to
a PhD program

807
00:41:18,530 --> 00:41:21,690
there candy exceptions made if you're an
amazing person

808
00:41:21,690 --> 00:41:24,760
um and you have an amazing body
experience that the admission committee

809
00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:25,240
would

810
00:41:25,240 --> 00:41:27,550
feel is equivalent to what you would
have gotten out a bachelor's degree

811
00:41:27,550 --> 00:41:29,580
there are circumstances like that

812
00:41:29,580 --> 00:41:33,609
in general um now is actually the
perfect time if you're thinking he might

813
00:41:33,609 --> 00:41:34,850
want to go to grad school

814
00:41:34,850 --> 00:41:38,250
being able to go and read it first will
really help you make it into graduate

815
00:41:38,250 --> 00:41:38,960
school

816
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:42,900
what worked for me is I told my faculty
at Auburn University hey I'm thinking

817
00:41:42,900 --> 00:41:44,620
you're going to graduate school it was
like

818
00:41:44,620 --> 00:41:47,740
is like gravy for them right call them
course minute went to graduate school

819
00:41:47,740 --> 00:41:49,550
but not everybody dies

820
00:41:49,550 --> 00:41:52,660
into their like I here's what you need
to do to prepare first you need to come

821
00:41:52,660 --> 00:41:54,270
be in undergraduate researcher

822
00:41:54,270 --> 00:41:57,190
in my group because that's the way that
you're going to get back to the other

823
00:41:57,190 --> 00:41:58,500
schools to what the other

824
00:41:58,500 --> 00:42:01,390
their I'm gonna be able to say he did
good research into they're going to want

825
00:42:01,390 --> 00:42:03,150
you on their team kind of thing

826
00:42:03,150 --> 00:42:07,740
um and so in theirs to some degree you
get out of college what you put into it

827
00:42:07,740 --> 00:42:11,060
right try hard learn lots of stuff take
a variety of courses

828
00:42:11,060 --> 00:42:14,910
um especially lot of electives in your
field take some German classes or

829
00:42:14,910 --> 00:42:16,049
something like that also

830
00:42:16,050 --> 00:42:19,130
but if you tell the faculty at the
school you're out

831
00:42:19,130 --> 00:42:21,980
that you're interested in grad school
that's your you know they'll tell you

832
00:42:21,980 --> 00:42:23,150
what to do that to you

833
00:42:23,150 --> 00:42:27,280
how to prepare the hope you write your
letter intent in four years

834
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:30,300
um and smooth sailing point

835
00:42:30,300 --> 00:42:34,130
much good luck sir okay first off we
have not seen any pictures the assless

836
00:42:34,130 --> 00:42:35,130
chaps

837
00:42:35,130 --> 00:42:38,170
second to help answer your question sir

838
00:42:38,170 --> 00:42:42,180
about college take some clip that means
not the clap

839
00:42:42,180 --> 00:42:45,200
but clap you can test out of a lot of
beginning courses

840
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:48,550
if you can speak read and write you can
take English 101 clip test be done

841
00:42:48,550 --> 00:42:49,220
within about

842
00:42:49,220 --> 00:42:53,870
an hour and a half did parks have your
college courses by the way can be

843
00:42:53,870 --> 00:42:55,400
clamped down on about

844
00:42:55,400 --> 00:42:59,220
you know three weeks a second is a lot
of colleges also give you work

845
00:42:59,220 --> 00:43:01,470
experience in life experience especially

846
00:43:01,470 --> 00:43:05,450
in New Jersey thomas edison College of
New Jersey I am so that's another way

847
00:43:05,450 --> 00:43:07,590
you can get outta doing a lot of those
credits

848
00:43:07,590 --> 00:43:12,600
third County College God in which one
was the same wherever you go

849
00:43:12,600 --> 00:43:16,420
fourth I wanna hear when you're gonna
have

850
00:43:16,420 --> 00:43:19,830
a operationalize IPL research project on

851
00:43:19,830 --> 00:43:22,980
with the Graduate School versus
certifications

852
00:43:22,980 --> 00:43:26,230
because frankly in information security

853
00:43:26,230 --> 00:43:29,520
we get a lot of get a degree it's better
than certs

854
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:32,820
your stupid get the search they're
better than to greet certifications like

855
00:43:32,820 --> 00:43:34,100
CISSP

856
00:43:34,100 --> 00:43:38,850
certifications like CISA in all SEP in
all those things and at the you know

857
00:43:38,850 --> 00:43:43,430
flavor of the week certification so I'm
curious your thoughts on the certs

858
00:43:43,430 --> 00:43:44,790
verses graduate school

859
00:43:44,790 --> 00:43:48,070
realize you probably biased towards grad
school you invested a lot of time and

860
00:43:48,070 --> 00:43:49,200
money in it

861
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:52,350
respectively I think that a.m.

862
00:43:52,350 --> 00:43:55,410
for example the federal government which
you said you did some work with if I

863
00:43:55,410 --> 00:43:56,600
remember correctly right

864
00:43:56,600 --> 00:44:00,650
the if you don't have a CISSP they don't
wanna talk to you

865
00:44:00,650 --> 00:44:04,400
so even if you have a PHD I've talked to
PHD's in a bit like

866
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:07,410
yeah they'll they'll talk to me about
science policy in for a sec to go with

867
00:44:07,410 --> 00:44:09,089
your sis

868
00:44:09,090 --> 00:44:12,170
so I'm kinda curious about great
questions

869
00:44:12,170 --> 00:44:15,300
well I guess requestion at the end there
great three other eight points

870
00:44:15,300 --> 00:44:21,320
um so the the

871
00:44:21,320 --> 00:44:24,850
the role that I had previous to my
current position as a Research Fellow

872
00:44:24,850 --> 00:44:26,690
inside my company

873
00:44:26,690 --> 00:44:30,710
I was the chief a curriculum

874
00:44:30,710 --> 00:44:33,840
for a information operations

875
00:44:33,840 --> 00:44:38,130
training program for the military

876
00:44:38,130 --> 00:44:41,590
where we will teach people how to defend
computer networks that were government

877
00:44:41,590 --> 00:44:44,070
and military computer networks for
example

878
00:44:44,070 --> 00:44:47,859
um and so I had I was spent the past
year

879
00:44:47,859 --> 00:44:51,259
answering exactly your question um and
I'm not

880
00:44:51,260 --> 00:44:57,210
is biased as you might think um the the
answer is

881
00:44:57,210 --> 00:45:01,490
the answer depends on what it is you
want to do with the job

882
00:45:01,490 --> 00:45:06,040
after you do the next thing where there
be to go get your CISSP your CH or

883
00:45:06,040 --> 00:45:06,770
whatever

884
00:45:06,770 --> 00:45:10,530
or go get your degree um if you want to
work

885
00:45:10,530 --> 00:45:14,000
in IT administration in InfoSec

886
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:17,390
role you're correct you're going to need
the certifications and that's the way

887
00:45:17,390 --> 00:45:19,020
that you're going to get the job

888
00:45:19,020 --> 00:45:22,270
um if you want to work in

889
00:45:22,270 --> 00:45:25,770
a for the position I wasn't for the

890
00:45:25,770 --> 00:45:29,900
curriculum developer a senior subject
matter expert on this training program

891
00:45:29,900 --> 00:45:33,220
um I don't have any I don't ever see a
security thing they didn't care

892
00:45:33,220 --> 00:45:36,859
it's like doctor britton holy smokes
that's who we want to be in there and

893
00:45:36,859 --> 00:45:41,590
in every meeting that we have with the
government um it's strange being doctor

894
00:45:41,590 --> 00:45:43,160
trippin sometimes cuz

895
00:45:43,160 --> 00:45:46,390
I walk in a room and someone will
introduce me and every I in the room

896
00:45:46,390 --> 00:45:47,270
will turn to me

897
00:45:47,270 --> 00:45:50,250
as though I'm about to spout some sort
of amazingly insightful information

898
00:45:50,250 --> 00:45:52,180
because I have a PHD

899
00:45:52,180 --> 00:45:55,589
um its II now keep your cards on the
meeting against

900
00:45:55,590 --> 00:45:59,050
with something out I need you 'em but um

901
00:45:59,050 --> 00:46:02,770
but I found it you know to have the kind
of jobs that I want to have one not in

902
00:46:02,770 --> 00:46:06,140
and in for a sec IT administrator but
rather I'm I'm

903
00:46:06,140 --> 00:46:09,970
talking with program managers about
potential research programs

904
00:46:09,970 --> 00:46:14,510
um involving our network operations
penetration testing vulnerability

905
00:46:14,510 --> 00:46:17,060
assessment automated tools do that kind
of thing

906
00:46:17,060 --> 00:46:20,720
um to be in that role having the degree
helps far more than having the

907
00:46:20,720 --> 00:46:22,050
certification does

908
00:46:22,050 --> 00:46:25,910
um getting certification while you're
getting your degree is

909
00:46:25,910 --> 00:46:31,430
always in option um thats

910
00:46:31,430 --> 00:46:34,620
I have not um I mean I'd

911
00:46:34,620 --> 00:46:40,660
I'm not belittling how much work goes
into it right

912
00:46:40,660 --> 00:46:43,950
know I've been now i've a I had several

913
00:46:43,950 --> 00:46:47,260
several of my friends have gone through
the process um I've been in

914
00:46:47,260 --> 00:46:50,730
impressed sorta impressed and not
impressed in some ways with it all

915
00:46:50,730 --> 00:46:54,330
um but I think that would be my answers
like it depends on what job you want

916
00:46:54,330 --> 00:46:58,299
if you want to be um if your work and
stuff that needs a certification

917
00:46:58,300 --> 00:47:02,540
get certification but also consider a
degree program of some sort

918
00:47:02,540 --> 00:47:05,730
because it teaches you a different set
of fundamentals

919
00:47:05,730 --> 00:47:08,910
I'm one other one assumes that I was
talking with the prep for this

920
00:47:08,910 --> 00:47:12,759
mentioned that he hires people now and
he can really tell

921
00:47:12,760 --> 00:47:16,390
people that that have a that have
computer science degrees the don't get

922
00:47:16,390 --> 00:47:17,180
it

923
00:47:17,180 --> 00:47:20,750
you can tell it usually doesn't hire
those people as they don't understand

924
00:47:20,750 --> 00:47:24,350
why something is a um there's a

925
00:47:24,350 --> 00:47:29,020
there's a concept over %uh performance
optimization you might have a loop that

926
00:47:29,020 --> 00:47:30,009
runs in the order

927
00:47:30,010 --> 00:47:33,850
in squared time verses in log in time
for example is a computer science

928
00:47:33,850 --> 00:47:35,620
concept you might run into

929
00:47:35,620 --> 00:47:39,290
um that you should understand if you
have a computer science degree that will

930
00:47:39,290 --> 00:47:40,770
help you do a better job

931
00:47:40,770 --> 00:47:44,520
%uh writing larger programs and writing
algorithms um

932
00:47:44,520 --> 00:47:48,080
if you don't understand that he's not
interested in you you know regardless be

933
00:47:48,080 --> 00:47:49,580
other things and so

934
00:47:49,580 --> 00:47:53,720
that serve my answer um what you

935
00:47:53,720 --> 00:47:56,920
school is great College is great because
you learn a lot of fundamentals

936
00:47:56,920 --> 00:48:00,080
gradually breakers for me it taught me
how to think about problems

937
00:48:00,080 --> 00:48:03,740
certifications can be great because they
can help punch the ticket to get you the

938
00:48:03,740 --> 00:48:04,880
job that you want

939
00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:08,609
that's the way love you sir

940
00:48:08,609 --> 00:48:12,250
thank you a retard thank you all I just
graduated with a Bachelor's

941
00:48:12,250 --> 00:48:16,200
regulations situation signs you I have
an interest in

942
00:48:16,200 --> 00:48:19,970
perhaps I just a few signs information
signs my priority

943
00:48:19,970 --> 00:48:23,470
TG research as were you you any

944
00:48:23,470 --> 00:48:26,640
for um

945
00:48:26,640 --> 00:48:30,569
the looking for graduate programs
there's probably not going to be a lot

946
00:48:30,569 --> 00:48:31,450
of difference

947
00:48:31,450 --> 00:48:34,750
in terms what it is you're looking for
if you're interested in teaching at

948
00:48:34,750 --> 00:48:36,190
whatever school you're out

949
00:48:36,190 --> 00:48:39,720
there's usually lots of opportunities
for that in fact there some courses that

950
00:48:39,720 --> 00:48:42,319
actually don't want to teach at all
sometimes operating systems for example

951
00:48:42,319 --> 00:48:45,880
if you're motivated gradually you can
get to teach that course

952
00:48:45,880 --> 00:48:50,020
after grad school if you have a PHD
there are institutions that are teaching

953
00:48:50,020 --> 00:48:53,060
oriented place is a Harvey Mudd College
for example is one that

954
00:48:53,060 --> 00:48:55,990
you note in undergraduate school the
teaching is the focus the military

955
00:48:55,990 --> 00:48:59,040
academies are like this if you're going
to teach at the Air Force Academy the

956
00:48:59,040 --> 00:49:01,730
naval academy for him these are
undergraduate engineering schools for

957
00:49:01,730 --> 00:49:02,730
the point is

958
00:49:02,730 --> 00:49:05,819
you know your your teaching people to
understand material get them out the

959
00:49:05,819 --> 00:49:08,420
door there are a lot of there are other
schools that are like that

960
00:49:08,420 --> 00:49:12,050
and so having the the general
preparation if you're going to get a PhD

961
00:49:12,050 --> 00:49:15,300
you're gonna have to do research you're
gonna have to write a dissertation

962
00:49:15,300 --> 00:49:18,530
pretty much um which is good skill to
have

963
00:49:18,530 --> 00:49:21,530
and that will prepare you for a teaching
or your job right that's the common

964
00:49:21,530 --> 00:49:22,950
thing to do

965
00:49:22,950 --> 00:49:26,930
use the commenting computer science do
you get a faculty position

966
00:49:26,930 --> 00:49:29,600
in that you have a certain you gotta
teach one to two courses per semester

967
00:49:29,600 --> 00:49:31,500
you got to do research and you got it

968
00:49:31,500 --> 00:49:34,710
servant activities and things like that
so if that's what you wanna do with your

969
00:49:34,710 --> 00:49:35,460
career

970
00:49:35,460 --> 00:49:40,650
um graduate schools will go sir

971
00:49:40,650 --> 00:49:44,069
I also just graduated from my bachelors
and so congratulations

972
00:49:44,069 --> 00:49:47,920
thank you %uh the concert at six years
is terrifying

973
00:49:47,920 --> 00:49:52,460
on so I and abuse and your take on where
does

974
00:49:52,460 --> 00:49:56,540
a master's program fall between be major
leagues undergrad

975
00:49:56,540 --> 00:49:59,800
bush league doctorate and

976
00:49:59,800 --> 00:50:03,109
you know trial run before you then go
actually a doctor

977
00:50:03,109 --> 00:50:08,310
got it um so the its there's some
advantages to it taking so long right so

978
00:50:08,310 --> 00:50:10,299
when I would go talking with my dad
students

979
00:50:10,300 --> 00:50:13,390
um as I got to be able to say like well
I'm in early nineteen grade this year

980
00:50:13,390 --> 00:50:14,319
they were they would

981
00:50:14,319 --> 00:50:18,800
was a Realtor I opener for them um

982
00:50:18,800 --> 00:50:23,060
master's degrees there are some really
good ones in there some really terrible

983
00:50:23,060 --> 00:50:24,370
ones they're not really

984
00:50:24,370 --> 00:50:27,509
it's hard to get tackling members who
were interested in

985
00:50:27,510 --> 00:50:30,350
working with you on a master's degree
because it's a short term kind of thing

986
00:50:30,350 --> 00:50:30,940
it's gonna be

987
00:50:30,940 --> 00:50:34,109
primarily focused on coursework right
you you

988
00:50:34,109 --> 00:50:37,850
will have the opportunity to do some
research and to create a master's thesis

989
00:50:37,850 --> 00:50:39,080
and have it go

990
00:50:39,080 --> 00:50:45,450
um and there are advantages you get out
of it menu

991
00:50:45,450 --> 00:50:48,870
its it's somewhere in between

992
00:50:48,870 --> 00:50:55,020
um

993
00:50:55,020 --> 00:50:59,360
it can be advantageous for getting jobs
um you definitely know you have a much

994
00:50:59,360 --> 00:51:02,500
broader set of understanding you take
more courses you take courses

995
00:51:02,500 --> 00:51:06,500
at the graduate level they teach you
anything it can be a good preparation

996
00:51:06,500 --> 00:51:11,330
and you can if you do a master's degree
for two years

997
00:51:11,330 --> 00:51:14,740
that is probably not gonna take u six
years to get your PhD is probably going

998
00:51:14,740 --> 00:51:18,000
to take you four maybe even fewer since
you already have work to be done with

999
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:20,070
your masters and you've got job
experience

1000
00:51:20,070 --> 00:51:24,360
there are people that um if you're in
the military you going to PG programme

1001
00:51:24,360 --> 00:51:25,240
you have three years

1002
00:51:25,240 --> 00:51:28,640
start to finish that yet to usually you
have a p/e you have a master's to be

1003
00:51:28,640 --> 00:51:29,600
before you do that

1004
00:51:29,600 --> 00:51:32,800
but you're able to finish your degree in
three years because

1005
00:51:32,800 --> 00:51:37,140
you're not 21 anymore you're 35 and you
know how to do work and how has been

1006
00:51:37,140 --> 00:51:38,440
your day an organizer time

1007
00:51:38,440 --> 00:51:42,310
um and so getting a masters degree if
you want to do it as a step to see what

1008
00:51:42,310 --> 00:51:43,310
grad schools like

1009
00:51:43,310 --> 00:51:46,610
is a way to dip your toes in the water
um

1010
00:51:46,610 --> 00:51:49,780
but if you think you might like it

1011
00:51:49,780 --> 00:51:54,200
you can also apply for the PhD program
getting and if it's too much

1012
00:51:54,200 --> 00:51:58,460
you can get a master's degree in Lievens
that's also another option I am i doing

1013
00:51:58,460 --> 00:52:00,480
on time I think I've got three minutes

1014
00:52:00,480 --> 00:52:04,150
five minutes yes ma'am 45 minutes

1015
00:52:04,150 --> 00:52:09,180
said

1016
00:52:09,180 --> 00:52:14,490
your you keep

1017
00:52:14,490 --> 00:52:17,850
good

1018
00:52:17,850 --> 00:52:24,850
help one up

1019
00:52:29,780 --> 00:52:36,780
and all

1020
00:52:41,570 --> 00:52:47,170
week

1021
00:52:47,170 --> 00:52:53,640
year by

1022
00:52:53,640 --> 00:53:00,640
said week

1023
00:53:07,270 --> 00:53:14,230
make

1024
00:53:14,230 --> 00:53:18,710
that is a great question and I'm going
to take the speakers prerogative to not

1025
00:53:18,710 --> 00:53:19,650
answer that question

1026
00:53:19,650 --> 00:53:22,750
um I will I will offer up a thought in
that

1027
00:53:22,750 --> 00:53:26,800
um if you

1028
00:53:26,800 --> 00:53:30,590
I'm sorry middle part I

1029
00:53:30,590 --> 00:53:34,450
um I mean being recorded um its

1030
00:53:34,450 --> 00:53:37,840
so there's there's lots of inflation
things that are bad reg there's great

1031
00:53:37,840 --> 00:53:39,390
inflation which is bad there's

1032
00:53:39,390 --> 00:53:42,520
degree inflation that is bad there's
this requirement inflation's that are

1033
00:53:42,520 --> 00:53:42,920
bad

1034
00:53:42,920 --> 00:53:46,840
there's an upside in that the more

1035
00:53:46,840 --> 00:53:50,410
if you do it right right if you go to
college in you don't dick around

1036
00:53:50,410 --> 00:53:54,200
you actually get a fair amount out at
the time collagen it can help prepare

1037
00:53:54,200 --> 00:53:55,780
you for your career thing

1038
00:53:55,780 --> 00:54:02,250
you want to do next um and so and so

1039
00:54:02,250 --> 00:54:05,690
I ions I don't have

1040
00:54:05,690 --> 00:54:09,630
a societal answer for for the world owes
these kind of inflation's

1041
00:54:09,630 --> 00:54:13,540
um other than to say if you find
yourself in this is my wife

1042
00:54:13,540 --> 00:54:18,490
um wanted to teach she is a professional
musician she would like to

1043
00:54:18,490 --> 00:54:22,180
she planned to get a master's degree in
music performance and then teach got it

1044
00:54:22,180 --> 00:54:25,760
um teach musical theory

1045
00:54:25,760 --> 00:54:30,010
teach music boy 6 enter a um and she
discovered recently that

1046
00:54:30,010 --> 00:54:33,430
she can no longer do that she can't just
get a master's degree in teaching music

1047
00:54:33,430 --> 00:54:37,930
because there's too many people with
PHD's in music performance that want to

1048
00:54:37,930 --> 00:54:41,580
teach students and hold the positions
and snatches having to revalue in say

1049
00:54:41,580 --> 00:54:45,020
okay do I want to go through it and get
the PhD in order to do that so

1050
00:54:45,020 --> 00:54:50,020
I agree that that that it's an odd
situation that we're boxing ourselves

1051
00:54:50,020 --> 00:54:50,520
into

1052
00:54:50,520 --> 00:54:53,540
if you find yourself in that situation
and here's

1053
00:54:53,540 --> 00:54:56,590
I'm going to take the rest to the
questions of why no over the back room

1054
00:54:56,590 --> 00:54:57,230
in which you guys

1055
00:54:57,230 --> 00:55:01,360
um here's my uplifting note which is
again you get out of school what you put

1056
00:55:01,360 --> 00:55:03,660
into it into if you find that you have
to do it

1057
00:55:03,660 --> 00:55:07,200
do better than everybody else and kick
everybody else's ass in that way you get

1058
00:55:07,200 --> 00:55:09,600
the job that you want and you get to
succeed at the individ-

1059
00:55:09,600 --> 00:55:13,160
um and that's one of the things the
Graduate School can do for you thank you

1060
00:55:13,160 --> 00:55:13,670
guys very much
