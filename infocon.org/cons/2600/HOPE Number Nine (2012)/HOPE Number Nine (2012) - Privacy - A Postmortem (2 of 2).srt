14 photos of yourself and we can
identify who you are or

yourself on the Internet then he was

3
00:00:07,339 --> 00:00:10,090
asked what should people do about their
privacy reasons

4
00:00:10,090 --> 00:00:13,639
well everyone should have a chance to
change their name once in their life

5
00:00:13,639 --> 00:00:16,820
the guys up front

6
00:00:16,820 --> 00:00:20,820

these guys have this information now I
want to tell you

8
00:00:24,779 --> 00:00:28,090
this is being made available only to
hope

9
00:00:28,090 --> 00:00:32,110
only to her there is a way

10
00:00:32,110 --> 00:00:35,870
to completely get rid of all but the
Google Data out there

11
00:00:35,870 --> 00:00:41,190
is a short instructional films or should
watch this while I go back there and see

12
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:48,190
if the hope is like committed fratricide
are my people

13
00:00:53,109 --> 00:00:56,440
heard about your privacy while using
Google the Internet giant so that

14
00:00:56,440 --> 00:00:59,460
understands Google is now offering users
a chance

15
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:02,679
opt out and live in privacy in a remote
mountain village

16
00:01:02,679 --> 00:01:05,770
tech trends reporter Geoff Tate has more
thanks Teresa

17
00:01:05,770 --> 00:01:10,189
they call it the of out village and it's
just what you'd expect from Google

18
00:01:10,189 --> 00:01:13,700
if you want to keep your information
private all you have to do his move to a

19
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:14,500
22-acre

20
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:17,990
opt-out village and not speak to anyone
from the outside world it's very simple

21
00:01:17,990 --> 00:01:22,339
just go to the Google front page click
the up out but and in minutes a van will

22
00:01:22,340 --> 00:01:23,869
come to your house and pick you up

23
00:01:23,869 --> 00:01:27,179
that same day it came up Google privacy
experts eliminate your home address

24
00:01:27,179 --> 00:01:28,310
guaranteeing

25
00:01:28,310 --> 00:01:32,520
it will no longer appear on Google local
pages and after just two days in the

26
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:33,350
back above and

27
00:01:33,350 --> 00:01:37,190
you're there in the village we can
guarantee that there's no chance

28
00:01:37,190 --> 00:01:40,548
renew emails because there are no
computers and because they're awesome

29
00:01:40,549 --> 00:01:41,069
under

30
00:01:41,069 --> 00:01:44,920
and tracked by Google there are no banks
or hospitals residents will be expected

31
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:46,130
to know how to grow food

32
00:01:46,130 --> 00:01:49,830
suture wounds and bury corpses by hand
if they plan to opt out

33
00:01:49,830 --> 00:01:53,689
and Google is gone the extra mile to
ensure that users who choose to opt out

34
00:01:53,689 --> 00:01:56,000
are given complete privacy in their new
home

35
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,700
a thirty foot tall ten foot thick
physical data security walton's

36
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:03,319
all former Google users from leaving the
village until they decide they want to

37
00:02:03,319 --> 00:02:04,649
start using Google again

38
00:02:04,649 --> 00:02:08,848
the Uptown village can be seen by Google
satellites because the entire town is

39
00:02:08,848 --> 00:02:11,599
enclosed in a large metal box with no
openings

40
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:15,209
google says those wishing to hop back
into using Google after their time in

41
00:02:15,209 --> 00:02:15,750
the village

42
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:19,379
will be allowed to do so if they agree
to be branded with the whimsical G on

43
00:02:19,379 --> 00:02:21,299
their foreheads to label them doubters

44
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:24,269
if you don't want to give us complete
access to your most private party

45
00:02:24,269 --> 00:02:25,239
feelings that's fine

46
00:02:25,239 --> 00:02:30,080
you can just toy on the hinterlands and
ion at Carter says the opt-out villages

47
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:34,040
already getting rave reviews what the
first village residents sent this letter

48
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:35,730
praising the total privacy

49
00:02:35,730 --> 00:02:39,440
inside the village saying all alone no
light hard to breathe

50
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:43,700
and that's one man whose data is secure
for the Onion News Network

91
00:05:20,499 --> 00:05:22,879
investigations unbelievable for hacking

92
00:05:22,879 --> 00:05:28,610
on believable for spearfishing I'm going
through the various sites for

93
00:05:28,610 --> 00:05:31,860
quickly all

94
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:35,930
for those %uh view who believe in
passwords

95
00:05:35,930 --> 00:05:39,379
which I hope a hacker conference there
will not be

96
00:05:39,379 --> 00:05:43,659
ace single person who doesn't already
understand

97
00:05:43,659 --> 00:05:47,400
that once you put the information out
there it's gone

98
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:51,349
its everywhere it's disseminated its
spread

99
00:05:51,349 --> 00:05:55,400
it's stolen it's investigated it's sold

100
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:58,939
there's no such thing as a secure
website 0

101
00:05:58,939 --> 00:06:01,960
if it's on the net and there's a net
connection

102
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:06,150
its gore you have given up control over
the information

103
00:06:06,150 --> 00:06:10,309
and it will get out your credit cards
will be stolen

104
00:06:10,309 --> 00:06:13,759
your social security number will be
disseminated

105
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:16,930
your job history your employment

00:06:20,719 --> 00:06:24,830
arm you know I understand that there
were some people talking earlier

108
00:06:24,830 --> 00:06:28,210
about security medical record systems

109
00:06:28,210 --> 00:06:31,249
I have here with me today some people
are actually

110
00:06:31,249 --> 00:06:34,550
experts on this their own security to
have the major

111
00:06:34,550 --> 00:06:37,580
hospitals in in New York

112
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:41,859

time

156
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:12,800
and I can tell you that these are some
big data ports

157
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:19,130
generalizing Netflix posts 87 percent to
public census data the anonymized

158
00:09:19,130 --> 00:09:23,510
Carnegie Mellon researchers accurately
guessed us a sense

159
00:09:23,510 --> 00:09:28,260
the more data that I have the more
finally defined

160
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:32,500
I can make an anonymous persona on the
on the you know

161
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:36,010
the more likely I'm gonna die I'm going
to identify you

162
00:09:36,010 --> 00:09:39,380
if I know that this anonymous person is
648

163
00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:43,110
Chinese a tap dancer and lives in Iowa

164
00:09:43,110 --> 00:09:46,280
probably one guy arm

165
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:49,839
but I gotta tell you it's pretty close
the the the

166
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:53,970
the public census data was just with the
first name

167
00:09:53,970 --> 00:09:57,600
and a zip code in a lotta places if I
put in

168
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:01,010
dolores in a zip code to eat that many

169
00:10:01,010 --> 00:10:03,950
I own a system where you can search for
somebody with just the first time in a

170
00:10:03,950 --> 00:10:04,710
zip code

171
00:10:04,710 --> 00:10:08,410
her first name in a day to birth if I
have your name

172
00:10:08,410 --> 00:10:12,400
your your birth in your zip code I own
you

173
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:16,310
I only Jackson of this is Dolores

174
00:10:16,310 --> 00:10:19,870
she's 43 and she lives on Smith Street

175
00:10:19,870 --> 00:10:24,130
sort of I know you're from that moment I
know everything about you within an hour

176
00:10:24,130 --> 00:10:28,840
to know do you not imitation is not that
horny more

177
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:32,420
here's a perfect example and I use those

178
00:10:32,420 --> 00:10:36,060
all the time no I got a really raw speed
up

179
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:39,290
congress subpoena all the search engines
because they wanted to see what they

180
00:10:39,290 --> 00:10:40,900
really know about you

181
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:44,610
are a all well to their credit even
though they suck at everything else

182
00:10:44,610 --> 00:10:47,780
said to congress we are going to
anonymized

183
00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:51,720
all about your searchers we're gonna
give them code numbers will give you the

184
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:52,810
search history

185
00:10:52,810 --> 00:10:57,300
but we will we will take out their names
and addresses

186
00:10:57,300 --> 00:11:00,460
and things like that now the minute this
was turned over to congress became

187
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:03,190
public records stupid

188
00:11:03,190 --> 00:11:06,670
and the New York Times god bless their
pink a little hearts took

189
00:11:06,670 --> 00:11:10,089
the AOL file and put a couple
researchers or

190
00:11:10,090 --> 00:11:14,170
and the researchers a terrific and they
took us bring them

191
00:11:14,170 --> 00:11:18,319
thing and they found here is

192
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:21,890
search your number 4417 749

193
00:11:21,890 --> 00:11:26,540
which they were able to resolve to miss
the home or not

194
00:11:26,540 --> 00:11:31,140
her search issue included sixty year old
single man landscapers in Woburn Georgia

195
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:36,010
shadow Lake subdivision or an old and
ordered urinates on everything

196
00:11:36,010 --> 00:11:39,700
that was your search history so they
weren't and sure enough

197
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:43,810
they fell hope who is going to search
for a 60-year-old

198
00:11:43,810 --> 00:11:47,660
single man a sixty year old single woman
Arnold

199
00:11:47,660 --> 00:11:52,110
or no shuttle a sub-divisional Auburn
Georgia owns a dork

200
00:11:52,110 --> 00:11:56,200
only one person missus arnold who lives
in the shadow Lake subdivision

201
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:59,750
in live in Georgia she's intersects
these issues in order to urinate on

202
00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:00,880
everything

203
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:07,560
not hard to figure that out you or your
search history folks

204
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:12,590
start building in Austin for heart it's
going to get worse

205
00:12:12,590 --> 00:12:16,550
algorithm can guess your sister

206
00:12:16,550 --> 00:12:20,550
browser fingerprinting

207
00:12:20,550 --> 00:12:24,560
everybody's browser is remarkably unique

208
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:29,310
I know you're logging in from a Mac I
know you're running

209
00:12:29,310 --> 00:12:32,920
10 points 6 I know this is the

210
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:36,280
sponsor that you have installed on your
system

211
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:41,439
I know that you or that you have these
plugins

212
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:45,060
I know that you have previously done

213
00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:48,190
XY and z. your browser

214
00:12:48,190 --> 00:12:51,530
has a reasonably damn good fingerprint

215
00:12:51,530 --> 00:12:56,170
and by the way if I can suck that your
history and your bookmarks file

216
00:12:56,170 --> 00:13:01,390
course I own you but even without that
your browser fingerprint is so unique

217
00:13:01,390 --> 00:13:05,430
that if you use their browser to do
cutie porn

218
00:13:05,430 --> 00:13:08,820
and I come later and I grip your
computer I can say

219
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:12,390
even if you've overridden 97 times

220
00:13:12,390 --> 00:13:16,080
with random characters or your kiddie
porn

221
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:19,670
I know that that's your browser and I
could prove it to the satisfaction of

222
00:13:19,670 --> 00:13:23,250
the jury

223
00:13:23,250 --> 00:13:26,710
browser fingerprinting dozens ARV

224
00:13:26,710 --> 00:13:32,280
above all for scholarly papers go to
abstract sites download the stuff

225
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:35,740
read it and be freaked now I'm not free

226
00:13:35,740 --> 00:13:40,260
I use this in my job and if you have
nothing to hide

227
00:13:40,260 --> 00:13:45,230
you have nothing to worry about nobody
has anything to hydro need

228
00:13:45,230 --> 00:13:48,580
ok there are companies that

229
00:13:48,580 --> 00:13:52,610
know you hide who you or you don't give
up your data

230
00:13:52,610 --> 00:13:57,210
so they're setting up browser
fingerprinting for marketing purposes

231
00:13:57,210 --> 00:14:01,580
this guy Daniel Norris from blue car for
his goal is the fingerprint

232
00:14:01,580 --> 00:14:05,780
$10 billion devices you already have
those

233
00:14:05,780 --> 00:14:08,819
he already has 200 million devices
fingerprinted

234
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:13,530
you think you're anonymous not anonymous
from this we saw

235
00:14:13,530 --> 00:14:17,160
any really is weasel because this is
stop being done without your knowledge

236
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:18,800
without your permission

237
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:21,830
that's on american if you're stupid of

238
00:14:21,830 --> 00:14:24,980
not to read your Terms of Service it's
on you

239
00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:28,160
if you're stupid enough to post a
drunken can include photo

240
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:32,069
it's on you that that stirs weasel

241
00:14:32,070 --> 00:14:35,410
thats weasel let's all remember and

242
00:14:35,410 --> 00:14:38,930
while I'm delighted by it as an
investigator

243
00:14:38,930 --> 00:14:42,170
as an american I'm not real founder

244
00:14:42,170 --> 00:14:46,700
cookies browsing history download
history embedded graphics track in your

245
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:48,029
ass everywhere

246
00:14:48,029 --> 00:14:53,070
these little micro pages passwords
appearing in URL strings

247
00:14:53,070 --> 00:14:56,870
hum you typed the wrong page

248
00:14:56,870 --> 00:15:00,060
and put in your password and hit click
and the page

249
00:15:00,060 --> 00:15:04,470
doesn't exist anymore your DNS server
will say

250
00:15:04,470 --> 00:15:07,470
no such page but it'll buffer that page
to a boil

251
00:15:07,470 --> 00:15:10,940
so Verizon will have it or Sprint or or

252
00:15:10,940 --> 00:15:14,930
whenever horrible cable company use

253
00:15:14,930 --> 00:15:18,490
companies like 44 doesn't exist anymore
the opera or

254
00:15:18,490 --> 00:15:21,980
was too much but there are many form
like companies

255
00:15:21,980 --> 00:15:25,870
who are smart enough to keep a low
profile DNS corrections

256
00:15:25,870 --> 00:15:30,170
even routers Cisco three weeks ago got
spanked because they were sucking down

257
00:15:30,170 --> 00:15:31,510
everybody's

258
00:15:31,510 --> 00:15:34,819
no history through their order

259
00:15:34,820 --> 00:15:38,640
Flash cookies made fresh cookies are
unbelievable they hide here they hide

260
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:39,370
their

261
00:15:39,370 --> 00:15:42,830
they disguise themselves they are worse
than any Trojan

262
00:15:42,830 --> 00:15:47,380
Ukiah go to wear normal cookies are you
can't go to your preference file on a

263
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:48,490
Mac by the way

264
00:15:48,490 --> 00:15:52,560
track that stuff in the settings file to
the trash every couple weeks

265
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:55,900
and and solve it that way they just re
sport

266
00:15:55,900 --> 00:16:00,279
their response by the way they hide the
history that they report

267
00:16:00,279 --> 00:16:04,500
they hide it in a remote location on
your drive so that when they re spore in

268
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:05,450
the able to say

269
00:16:05,450 --> 00:16:08,460
yup still the same guy now

270
00:16:08,460 --> 00:16:12,910
forensic linguistics this is an amazing
free concert

271
00:16:12,910 --> 00:16:16,469
this is won't have the

272
00:16:16,470 --> 00:16:20,540
most fascinating forensic developments
in my opinion

273
00:16:20,540 --> 00:16:23,849
since DNA and it makes all you guys

274
00:16:23,850 --> 00:16:27,279
sitting ducks on the net even if used
for

275
00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:30,820
even if you use a strange computer even
if you go to library

276
00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:36,020
even if you were ski mask I while you're
at a large

277
00:16:36,020 --> 00:16:40,620
I am the woodshop seen some pictures a
guy's do it stop at the library though

278
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:45,130
they need to I'll go on reddit from Todd

279
00:16:45,130 --> 00:16:48,900
here's a guy this guy's an assistant US
attorneys a federal prosecutors name is

280
00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:51,230
Sal Perricone

281
00:16:51,230 --> 00:16:55,360
he was involved in a case he was so
excited just

282
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:58,850
by the people on the other side the
defendants and the potential defendants

283
00:16:58,850 --> 00:17:03,310
and the witnesses he put up a blog when
he was enormously post the organization

284
00:17:03,310 --> 00:17:04,510
about these people

285
00:17:04,510 --> 00:17:08,379
which is a big no no if you're the
prosecutor but he was doing and under

286
00:17:08,380 --> 00:17:09,650
the alias

287
00:17:09,650 --> 00:17:13,480
HL mencken an real momentum 1951

288
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:18,079
arm so the people who are on the
receiving end

289
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:23,209
over this a anonymous nasty

290
00:17:23,209 --> 00:17:28,720
generally legally improper postings
hired a forensic linguistics expert

291
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:32,620
and they were able to determine some
really really unique words

292
00:17:32,620 --> 00:17:36,669
like do buddy do but he is the active
bean

293
00:17:36,669 --> 00:17:39,700
dubious about something you every other
word

294
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:43,799
I never heard that word but these posts
all had were duping

295
00:17:43,799 --> 00:17:47,480
in the entire planet there's one guy who
all these

296
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:50,990
pleadings public pleadings filed in
court over the years have used the word

297
00:17:50,990 --> 00:17:57,000
do believe there's another one

298
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:02,490
another really really ridiculous word
are

299
00:18:02,490 --> 00:18:08,259
all arm Paris

300
00:18:08,259 --> 00:18:13,749
hope readout spelled re-do you BT like

301
00:18:13,749 --> 00:18:17,990
I'm doubted again I really doubt it

302
00:18:17,990 --> 00:18:22,179
nobody uses these two words so they had
this forensic linguistics guy who's a

303
00:18:22,179 --> 00:18:23,169
retired

304
00:18:23,169 --> 00:18:26,799
FBI agent who was doing this for the FBI
and it was involved

305
00:18:26,799 --> 00:18:29,999
in tracking down the Europe armor and
people who sent ransom notes

306
00:18:29,999 --> 00:18:33,999
and stuff like that he said same got
nobody else uses these words

307
00:18:33,999 --> 00:18:38,129
so they got a subpoena and before they
could use the subpoena

308
00:18:38,129 --> 00:18:41,429
to see where the logins were coming from

309
00:18:41,429 --> 00:18:45,200
mister so-called HL mencken Perricone

310
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:50,710
prosecutors okay yup and by the way he
is obviously no longer on the case

311
00:18:50,710 --> 00:18:54,759
I think he is and by the way here's the
times-picayune

312
00:18:54,759 --> 00:18:58,749
article it up fascinating story cell
Perricone

313
00:18:58,749 --> 00:19:03,840
Google read about it it's the perfect
example of a forensic linguistics

314
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:07,769
if I have a big enough sample love your
writing there are really really unique

315
00:19:07,769 --> 00:19:08,340
things about

316
00:19:08,340 --> 00:19:11,928
everybody's combination of words
commonly use phrases

317
00:19:11,929 --> 00:19:16,570
punctuation I did a case with the a
woman from the New York Times issues

318
00:19:16,570 --> 00:19:19,049
going after cricket person

319
00:19:19,049 --> 00:19:23,070
when she started getting all kinds of
threats that were written by one guy

320
00:19:23,070 --> 00:19:26,269
and she was communicating with another
guy and she noticed

321
00:19:26,269 --> 00:19:29,799
that both of these people would do

322
00:19:29,799 --> 00:19:33,210
parentheses space period

323
00:19:33,210 --> 00:19:37,320
in a punctuation she was able to figure
out was the same guy and bust a min

324
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:40,720
so on and so forth principally West
makes it

325
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:45,220
really impossible for you to hide if
there's a big enough sample

326
00:19:45,220 --> 00:19:49,289
up your legitimate writings and even you
with the nose and glasses

327
00:19:49,289 --> 00:19:53,289
I can connect that to all your anonymous
poster forensic linguistics

328
00:19:53,289 --> 00:19:58,279
photos photos if I know that you posted
anonymous photo on the web

329
00:19:58,279 --> 00:20:01,629
I get your EXIF tags from those enormous
photos

330
00:20:01,629 --> 00:20:04,769
I search on the web for those EXIF tags

331
00:20:04,769 --> 00:20:08,240
and I find Bob Jones is using a

332
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:13,289
camera with the exact same unique serial
number

333
00:20:13,289 --> 00:20:17,320
electronic serial number on the camera I
know that those anonymous photos

334
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:22,480
of him you know spanking a naked girl in
Cancun or whatever

335
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:25,730
that the or worse or worse it's a good
way

336
00:20:25,730 --> 00:20:29,320
to catch child molesters and pedophiles
are

337
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:33,299
every digital device has a unique
fingerprint now

338
00:20:33,299 --> 00:20:36,889
and I can anything that you post on the
net not use your words

339
00:20:36,889 --> 00:20:40,090
but your photos in your video and your
and your

340
00:20:40,090 --> 00:20:43,678
mp3 files and everything I can trace
back to you by just

341
00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:47,889
comparison of digital data it is harder
and harder and harder to saw

342
00:20:47,889 --> 00:20:52,999
heart-to-heart know by the way when you
could burn a photo

343
00:20:52,999 --> 00:20:56,309
click the box that says do not a bad
here so I have to

344
00:20:56,309 --> 00:21:00,590
if you are in fact an evil criminal
little trip to you

345
00:21:00,590 --> 00:21:04,928
which thank god you're not listen to and
there or there are web is so

346
00:21:04,929 --> 00:21:08,710
for can easy to do now not just for guys
like me or the NSA

347
00:21:08,710 --> 00:21:12,190
that this commercial services other than
what you do for free like

348
00:21:12,190 --> 00:21:16,629
Google for search engine on what have
Cameron or signatures

349
00:21:16,629 --> 00:21:20,200
just even if the EXIF tag isn't in there

350
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:24,429
every camera sensor has a unique
signature what ballistics on a firearm

351
00:21:24,429 --> 00:21:29,090
you shoot a ball the the scratches on
the barrel are unique to use gone

352
00:21:29,090 --> 00:21:33,379
you can match bullets from this photo 5
this bullet fired this boulevard

353
00:21:33,379 --> 00:21:37,929
if you have one cameras 14 is digital
voice signature and others

354
00:21:37,929 --> 00:21:42,169
you can be analyzed the photo just
letting you know just letting you know

355
00:21:42,169 --> 00:21:46,090
here's an example of the the digital
hive mind

356
00:21:46,090 --> 00:21:49,590
up just showing in so many people know
what this photo is

357
00:21:49,590 --> 00:21:53,119

reasonably intelligent people

358
00:21:53,119 --> 00:21:57,860
unlike usual approach but up

359
00:21:57,860 --> 00:22:01,269
I'm gonna be in trouble happened so that
or a

360
00:22:01,269 --> 00:22:04,619

00:22:25,369 --> 00:22:28,928
2010 arm so

368
00:22:28,929 --> 00:22:32,629
the next day story is written on the AP

369
00:22:32,629 --> 00:22:36,850

370
00:22:36,850 --> 00:22:40,539
just outside the frame

371
00:22:40,539 --> 00:22:44,289
%uh that now-famous photograph was a
career CIA analyst in the hunt for the

372
00:22:44,289 --> 00:22:46,039
world's most wanted terrorist

373
00:22:46,039 --> 00:22:49,529
there may have been no one more
important this from an article called a

374
00:22:49,529 --> 00:22:51,570

the brilliance

382

are Defense Intelligence Agency counter
security guys

383
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:28,090

moment

384
00:23:28,090 --> 00:23:31,928
he's not prepared to any of the other
photos took two hours to identify the

385
00:23:31,929 --> 00:23:32,509
SCA

386
00:23:32,509 --> 00:23:36,059

thought

394
00:24:02,350 --> 00:24:05,480
let's look at this from another angle

395
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:09,360
and if you zoom in seeing the corner
there

396
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:13,850
there is a God hurried car bomber

397

not gonna figure out who she is

423
00:26:02,739 --> 00:26:07,769
I'll be there were probably 40,000
analysts working on this

424
00:26:07,769 --> 00:26:11,149
it's it's it's unbelievable you're not

426
00:26:15,259 --> 00:26:21,690
anonymous the minute you say that you
are so screwed

427
00:26:21,690 --> 00:26:25,320
and there aren't any companies give you
a simplified planetary

428
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:29,869
whose job it is to shock now all love
your public data

429
00:26:29,869 --> 00:26:33,580
not just stuff like public record data
like voter

430
00:26:33,580 --> 00:26:37,340
and and and and and real property and

431
00:26:37,340 --> 00:26:41,049
social security information or phone
whatever but they grab your Facebook in

432
00:26:41,049 --> 00:26:42,739
your Twitter in your Google for

433
00:26:42,739 --> 00:26:48,149

00:26:52,239 --> 00:26:55,999
alternative loggins which you go

436
00:26:55,999 --> 00:26:59,509
yeah that's convenient no its not

437
00:26:59,509 --> 00:27:02,609
you need to have a separate password

438
00:27:02,609 --> 00:27:08,408
every site don't believe me s the owners
obstruct for if that's true or not

439
00:27:08,409 --> 00:27:13,950
right lesson if you log into every site

440
00:27:13,950 --> 00:27:17,769
with your Facebook login a

441
00:27:17,769 --> 00:27:21,690
the people or view facebook login have
your login to every side

442
00:27:21,690 --> 00:27:26,899
and be Facebook has all love your login
information

443
00:27:26,899 --> 00:27:30,379

every little thing you do is in a
database somewhere

523
00:32:33,460 --> 00:32:37,289
for example you go to a bowl or they

driver's license now as proof that you
gave them

525
00:32:40,759 --> 00:32:44,649
an ID that shows that you're a mean age
to drink and then the data goes into a

526
00:32:44,649 --> 00:32:46,720
database

527
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:52,249
shop run bombs first law write this down

relationship in activity analysis and
behavior informant rabbi

687
00:43:05,450 --> 00:43:09,080
by looking at what you've done in who
you've done it with I can tell who

688
00:43:09,080 --> 00:43:10,120

I can tell what results from your
activities

691
00:43:17,480 --> 00:43:20,910
I'm not gonna go through this because
the clock is ticking but it tells me

692
00:43:20,910 --> 00:43:21,560
know by the way

693
00:43:21,560 --> 00:43:25,060
here is from an actual subpoena his
assault our response

694
00:43:25,060 --> 00:43:28,100
it tells me down to 25 feet

695
00:43:28,100 --> 00:43:33,920
if you look at that where you are
sometimes it tells me you're on the spot

696
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:37,580
again Google p2p Google p2p this is

697
00:43:37,580 --> 00:43:41,500
gonna be a game changer this in the new
GPS satellites and everybody using

698
00:43:41,500 --> 00:43:43,560
smartphones

699
00:43:43,560 --> 00:43:48,330
appears a here's a this is sold to
private industry

700
00:43:48,330 --> 00:43:52,190
now I'm not going to get up here a very
upfront about you

701
00:43:52,190 --> 00:43:56,280
about this I'm not telling you the best
stuff I know

702
00:43:56,280 --> 00:44:01,330
for two reasons for civil the publicly
available stuff is friggin of

703
00:44:01,330 --> 00:44:05,170
and I'm I believe making my point

704
00:44:05,170 --> 00:44:09,400
and second of all of course there are
bad people out there that the stuff

705
00:44:09,400 --> 00:44:13,260
does deserve to be targeted a and it's
not my place I'm not

706
00:44:13,260 --> 00:44:17,820
Julian assault charge Hui to talk about
some other time

707
00:44:17,820 --> 00:44:21,760
I'll I don't believe in what doing the
Sarge is doing

708
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:25,200
I believe in freedom of information
that's for damn sure but I don't believe

709
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:27,640
that I have a right to take secret
information or

710
00:44:27,640 --> 00:44:30,900
law enforcement information and decide
myself guess what

711
00:44:30,900 --> 00:44:35,120
so I don't discuss that I think that's
wrong I think it's bad

712
00:44:35,120 --> 00:44:38,330
by the way I do think Julian assigned
rate those two women so that puts a

713
00:44:38,330 --> 00:44:40,299
membership was too

714
00:44:40,300 --> 00:44:46,060
arm but this is an example of what's out
there that's used by law enforcement

715
00:44:46,060 --> 00:44:49,220
not only does it suck in everything your
IP

716
00:44:49,220 --> 00:44:52,760
contacts your email your profile

717
00:44:52,760 --> 00:44:57,030
your social networking contacts but it
builds a profile of you

718
00:44:57,030 --> 00:45:00,870
and it can follow if it knows you using
two or three froze it identifies

719
00:45:00,870 --> 00:45:05,069
listen you have a regular phone and you
have a drop for

720
00:45:05,070 --> 00:45:09,550
everywhere your regular phone here's
including three o'clock in the morning

721
00:45:09,550 --> 00:45:12,780
her drop phones

722
00:45:12,780 --> 00:45:18,300
she is it possible bob is using a second
phone I don't know about

723
00:45:18,300 --> 00:45:22,450
Kamau so this analyzes that it finds
that second phone

724
00:45:22,450 --> 00:45:26,030
and it and it grabs the data American
group today

725
00:45:26,030 --> 00:45:30,740
after the shock and here multiple
headphones multiple systems locations

726
00:45:30,740 --> 00:45:31,690
whatever

727
00:45:31,690 --> 00:45:35,740
the funny thing is the US government
gives this stuff lol

728
00:45:35,740 --> 00:45:38,970
and in the case a meal on it was turned
against them

729
00:45:38,970 --> 00:45:43,180
historic data I'm gonna keep zipping
through this but

730
00:45:43,180 --> 00:45:47,419
let me just tell you I can find out
without breaking a sweat

731
00:45:47,420 --> 00:45:51,750
everywhere you go everybody who spent
time with everything you like to do

732
00:45:51,750 --> 00:45:56,210
everywhere you do it and who you do it
with just from yourself

733
00:45:56,210 --> 00:45:59,970
okay part of the show you a whole lotta
slides that's the bottom line

734
00:45:59,970 --> 00:46:03,330
and I'm here's

735
00:46:03,330 --> 00:46:06,779
you by the way here's what I've the
programs being

736
00:46:06,780 --> 00:46:10,830
tested were reports locations and SIM
cards in activities

737
00:46:10,830 --> 00:46:14,340
and everything the beta test name of the
program is honest to god guilt by

738
00:46:14,340 --> 00:46:16,830
association

739
00:46:16,830 --> 00:46:20,840
and years link analysis here's a
criminal conspiracy

740
00:46:20,840 --> 00:46:25,370
you know who are the central guy's we
know that that guy's a bad guy main bad

741
00:46:25,370 --> 00:46:26,839
guy everybody goes to

742
00:46:26,840 --> 00:46:30,150
and so on and so forth guys I'm not
telling you anything you couldn't find

743
00:46:30,150 --> 00:46:30,640
out

744
00:46:30,640 --> 00:46:34,009
if you care to do so but is going on
Google

745
00:46:34,010 --> 00:46:37,990
a lot of these examples because I knew
what to look for

746
00:46:37,990 --> 00:46:42,010
I when I went right to the company's web
sites I will try to Google Voice up this

747
00:46:42,010 --> 00:46:42,910
although

748
00:46:42,910 --> 00:46:46,399
no no this is a secret now

749
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:49,550
gonna do this really relations arm

750
00:46:49,550 --> 00:46:54,410
me a lot there's an example that are
given me know about me log

751
00:46:54,410 --> 00:46:58,089
what there was a terrorist

752
00:46:58,090 --> 00:47:02,070
or more Abu Bakkar large terrace real
terrorist

753
00:47:02,070 --> 00:47:05,350
we're not going to get into that see I
thought it was a terrorist

754
00:47:05,350 --> 00:47:09,940
so they sent 26 guys to Milan and a
snatch them up

755
00:47:09,940 --> 00:47:13,830
and they did what's called an
extraordinary rendition which shows

756
00:47:13,830 --> 00:47:17,630
a euphemism for putting a bag over his
head taping a mop and shipping them to a

757
00:47:17,630 --> 00:47:18,480
country

758
00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:21,560
where we won't torture I'm but they will

759
00:47:21,560 --> 00:47:26,130
and in this case they ship them to Egypt
where was tortured horribly

760
00:47:26,130 --> 00:47:29,750
homosexual rape beatings burnings
whatever

761
00:47:29,750 --> 00:47:32,900
for a few years there's actually

762
00:47:32,900 --> 00:47:36,520
a book on a really really good we're not
an opinionated left-wing book a book

763
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:37,670
that

764
00:47:37,670 --> 00:47:42,160
even i think is good call the a
kidnapping in milan which I urge you to

765
00:47:42,160 --> 00:47:43,310
read

766
00:47:43,310 --> 00:47:47,570
arm and then after three years have been
tortured

767
00:47:47,570 --> 00:47:52,370
both the egyptians and the CIA agents
who were observing the torture

768
00:47:52,370 --> 00:47:56,960
for good partner said her hoops

769
00:47:56,960 --> 00:48:00,610
and they put a bag on a plane and they
put it back to me a lot

770
00:48:00,610 --> 00:48:05,650
arm where the prosecutor was a pretty
good guy pretty good cop

771
00:48:05,650 --> 00:48:09,850
a anti-mafia prosecutor by the name of
the

772
00:48:09,850 --> 00:48:13,950
bruno magli says we have to identify
these guys

773
00:48:13,950 --> 00:48:17,000
so here's what he did

774
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:21,530
that by the way is from an actual
surveillance thats Omar Abu Bakkar

775
00:48:21,530 --> 00:48:25,040
who kinda looks like somebody I wanna
rendition if I was in that

776
00:48:25,040 --> 00:48:29,620
for a month don't judge people by looks

777
00:48:29,620 --> 00:48:32,740
so here's what happened

778
00:48:32,740 --> 00:48:36,220
they figure it out where he was
kidnapped

779
00:48:36,220 --> 00:48:39,260
they knew where he was kidnapped us
there were two witnesses to the

780
00:48:39,260 --> 00:48:40,250
kidnapping

781
00:48:40,250 --> 00:48:44,230
who went to the police so they want to
the cell towers

782
00:48:44,230 --> 00:48:47,230
using information by the way that have
been giving to them

783
00:48:47,230 --> 00:48:50,470
by the CIA for the terrorism work

784
00:48:50,470 --> 00:48:53,570
and they grabbed all all the

785
00:48:53,570 --> 00:48:58,230
connections now for those of you who are
tech weenies our phone weenies

786
00:48:58,230 --> 00:49:03,260
or phone phreaks is Captain Crunch in
the room for example

787
00:49:03,260 --> 00:49:06,600
you know that GSM cell phone has two
things

788
00:49:06,600 --> 00:49:10,800
that has a hardwired code which is
randomly called either and yes earner an

789
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:11,720
meid

790
00:49:11,720 --> 00:49:15,460
or an IMEI depending on who you're
asking and it hurts

791
00:49:15,460 --> 00:49:19,070
a SIM card both these things are
absolutely unique

792
00:49:19,070 --> 00:49:22,390
no phone has that hardware ID

793
00:49:22,390 --> 00:49:25,750
no phone has that SIM card ID and
together

794
00:49:25,750 --> 00:49:31,400
they are super super unique so they went
and they identified all the SIM cards

795
00:49:31,400 --> 00:49:34,950
and all the hardware ideas in the
location

796
00:49:34,950 --> 00:49:40,100
and they found people who met a certain
profile

797
00:49:40,100 --> 00:49:43,860
they warrant Ian the area normally

798
00:49:43,860 --> 00:49:46,970
they didn't live in the area there some
numbers and their

799
00:49:46,970 --> 00:49:51,910
hi mera whatever were there at nine they
did the most basic analysis and i want

800
00:49:51,910 --> 00:49:52,839
to tell you

801
00:49:52,840 --> 00:49:56,060
the key question for analysts to ask
years

802
00:49:56,060 --> 00:50:00,310
what does X look like what is a
terrorist look like

803
00:50:00,310 --> 00:50:03,840
what is a kidnapper look like what is a
money launderer look like

804
00:50:03,840 --> 00:50:08,940
and once you figure out the profile then
you go out to big data to the datasets

805
00:50:08,940 --> 00:50:13,920
when you find everything that matches
that more often than not you right

806
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:17,330
more from the night you're right power
for a drug dealer for one for money

807
00:50:17,330 --> 00:50:18,060
order

808
00:50:18,060 --> 00:50:21,420
today if I have the right analyst and
the right

809
00:50:21,420 --> 00:50:25,390
general profile I can find drug deals I
can find money orders

810
00:50:25,390 --> 00:50:28,650
I can find terrorist just by pressing a
button there is

811
00:50:28,650 --> 00:50:31,790
an updated

812
00:50:31,790 --> 00:50:34,970
so they said what with the kidnappers
look like well they would look like

813
00:50:34,970 --> 00:50:35,870
people

814
00:50:35,870 --> 00:50:38,980
who I'm

815
00:50:38,980 --> 00:50:42,920
were in the area at the time of the
kidnapping

816
00:50:42,920 --> 00:50:46,650
then checking back we would see that
they were there

817
00:50:46,650 --> 00:50:50,040
intermittently we would also see that
they

818
00:50:50,040 --> 00:50:54,570
came together meaning four-man team does
the snatch

819
00:50:54,570 --> 00:50:58,180
four-man team does the recount in
advance so on and so forth

820
00:50:58,180 --> 00:51:01,540
they knew what to look for somebody who
SIM card is there

821
00:51:01,540 --> 00:51:04,550
all day because they're running a store
working in the hotel

822
00:51:04,550 --> 00:51:07,830
by the way the best tower that they used
was on the roof other

823
00:51:07,830 --> 00:51:11,870
don't know tell their I'll the profile

824
00:51:11,870 --> 00:51:16,259
the profile was X they figure out the
profile

825
00:51:16,260 --> 00:51:19,750
and they found 3

826
00:51:19,750 --> 00:51:23,210
for 5 six groups have cell phones

827
00:51:23,210 --> 00:51:26,360
wanted the cell phones they knew

828
00:51:26,360 --> 00:51:31,460
because this anti-terrorism prosecutor
was talking to the owner that so far on

829
00:51:31,460 --> 00:51:32,810
a regular basis

830
00:51:32,810 --> 00:51:36,529
he was the CIA station chief

831
00:51:36,530 --> 00:51:42,910
so they were haha and things started
falling apart from there

832
00:51:42,910 --> 00:51:46,040
11 Sims work in the snatch location

833
00:51:46,040 --> 00:51:49,480
were in cannot contact with six sermons
at

834
00:51:49,480 --> 00:51:52,700
a blocking location on the a4

835
00:51:52,700 --> 00:51:55,940
another three sermons were

836
00:51:55,940 --> 00:52:00,910
shared serbs in the months before the
abduction 20 service had been a regular

837
00:52:00,910 --> 00:52:02,290
frequent contact

838
00:52:02,290 --> 00:52:06,710
with the other they were able to discern
patterns

839
00:52:06,710 --> 00:52:11,460
here is by the way I want actually got
copies of the court file

840
00:52:11,460 --> 00:52:15,400
here is an actual thing from the court
for these are people talking to other

841
00:52:15,400 --> 00:52:17,360
people in the target serbs

842
00:52:17,360 --> 00:52:20,380
and they were able to track these
sermons

843
00:52:20,380 --> 00:52:26,520
extrapolating out from known people
including Bob lady the CIA station chief

844
00:52:26,520 --> 00:52:29,730
and they were able to identify

845
00:52:29,730 --> 00:52:34,120
for example three other people now he
gets worse by the way

846
00:52:34,120 --> 00:52:38,740
after the kidnapping the snatch team in
the blocking team dispersed

847
00:52:38,740 --> 00:52:43,170
they dispersed by getting together at
the same hotels

848
00:52:43,170 --> 00:52:46,320
by checking in using credit cards

849
00:52:46,320 --> 00:52:51,360
that we're all build to the same PO Box
where

850
00:52:51,360 --> 00:52:54,890
correct gets worse

851
00:52:54,890 --> 00:52:59,890
the credit cards the first 13 digits of
the credit cards were

852
00:52:59,890 --> 00:53:04,779
Cirque one show all

853
00:53:04,780 --> 00:53:07,840
causes me pain as an investigator

854
00:53:07,840 --> 00:53:11,440
so eventually they were able to build
these profiles they were able to

855
00:53:11,440 --> 00:53:12,910
identify everybody

856
00:53:12,910 --> 00:53:17,009
this one goes to this hotel the Hilton
talk so that's all for

857
00:53:17,010 --> 00:53:20,300
by the way they found that a bunch of
the CIA teams were shacking up

858
00:53:20,300 --> 00:53:23,800
this girl in the top checking in with
this guy so it's over

859
00:53:23,800 --> 00:53:27,700
which busted up two marriages by the way
when the indictment came out

860
00:53:27,700 --> 00:53:31,360
no no that's really to read the book
really fascinating

861
00:53:31,360 --> 00:53:36,160
and they were able to alternately that's
the indictment

862
00:53:36,160 --> 00:53:41,210
20 your wits not Bravo its what a god
damn shame because these are

863
00:53:41,210 --> 00:53:43,810
for the most part I've looked into the
background of these people these people

864
00:53:43,810 --> 00:53:46,660
who are really good americans real
patriots

865
00:53:46,660 --> 00:53:50,399
join the CIO you don't get paid real
well in the CIA I can tell you that

866
00:53:50,400 --> 00:53:53,810
if you work for the government work for
private sector I get paid five times

867
00:53:53,810 --> 00:53:55,560
what these guys do and they

868
00:53:55,560 --> 00:54:00,150
work 87 times harder than I do in their
room ninety seven times as much dangers

869
00:54:00,150 --> 00:54:01,420
are

870
00:54:01,420 --> 00:54:05,780
and they're mostly doing it for american
across the kit get a private sector job

871
00:54:05,780 --> 00:54:08,910
if they wanna go and become what's
called red cards

872
00:54:08,910 --> 00:54:13,310
they get five times as much money I mean
literally five times as much more

873
00:54:13,310 --> 00:54:16,420
arm these are these are good people it's
not a problem

874
00:54:16,420 --> 00:54:19,420
so what

875
00:54:19,420 --> 00:54:22,510
kiss my us

876
00:54:22,510 --> 00:54:26,120
these are not not since I know some of
these people udall

877
00:54:26,120 --> 00:54:29,210
they were foolish but they are not know
it is by the way

878
00:54:29,210 --> 00:54:33,040
I'm the only one in this room who
actually was a Nazi owner

879
00:54:33,040 --> 00:54:36,550
and Court notes don't tell me about
what's okay

880
00:54:36,550 --> 00:54:39,820
arm unfortunately

881
00:54:39,820 --> 00:54:43,270
these twenty-six people were poor I
don't was don't

882
00:54:43,270 --> 00:54:46,860
entirely through electronic means

883
00:54:46,860 --> 00:54:51,700
if this can be done to these guys
emergent your daily life

884
00:54:51,700 --> 00:54:55,070
and people do it not because they want
to invade your privacy

885
00:54:55,070 --> 00:54:59,010
they want to sell you stuff things are
to the point now where you are walking

886
00:54:59,010 --> 00:55:00,760
down the aisle

887
00:55:00,760 --> 00:55:05,850
you stop in a supermarket and you look
at a display of canned peaches

888
00:55:05,850 --> 00:55:10,560
on your phone will pop up ocupado for
certain brand of canned peaches

889
00:55:10,560 --> 00:55:13,790
to try to get you to buy those peaches
and if you in fact

890
00:55:13,790 --> 00:55:17,450
do by those peaches which will be
confirmed because

891
00:55:17,450 --> 00:55:21,310
you're gonna probably be using your so
far as the payment device but

892
00:55:21,310 --> 00:55:25,890
for now using your credit card as a
payment device

893
00:55:25,890 --> 00:55:29,750
Apple gets a credit or Android slash
Google it's a crime

894
00:55:29,750 --> 00:55:33,260
or and markets a credit you're walking
into a

895
00:55:33,260 --> 00:55:36,630
steakhouse on your four-part such top

896
00:55:36,630 --> 00:55:40,180
to go to Bob's Tecos his 33 percent of

897
00:55:40,180 --> 00:55:43,620
for fried steak house back into their go
to books to the right

898
00:55:43,620 --> 00:55:47,640
33 percent of that is coming

899
00:55:47,640 --> 00:55:51,690
has come will becoming more more MORE

900
00:55:51,690 --> 00:55:56,230
it's not because they want to invade
your privacy they want to sell you stuff

901
00:55:56,230 --> 00:56:00,360
and so it's so in tensely accurate

902
00:56:00,360 --> 00:56:05,100
an intensely all-inclusive that these
private companies which by the way

903
00:56:05,100 --> 00:56:09,030
you have no control over no control
whatsoever

904
00:56:09,030 --> 00:56:12,380
retail store there is a

905
00:56:12,380 --> 00:56:15,480
drug deal a bona fide Batman drug dealer

906
00:56:15,480 --> 00:56:21,170
who was caught in large part because the
FBI put a bumblebee percy GPS tracking

907
00:56:21,170 --> 00:56:21,860
device

908
00:56:21,860 --> 00:56:25,930
on its core so his attorney

909
00:56:25,930 --> 00:56:30,400
or use all the way up to the Supreme
Court this is an invasion of privacy

910
00:56:30,400 --> 00:56:34,830
they should have had a war Supreme Court
agrees this guy's

911
00:56:34,830 --> 00:56:38,370
convictions thrown out he has to be
retried

912
00:56:38,370 --> 00:56:42,589
arm FBI said no problem

917
00:56:59,830 --> 00:57:03,620

now any smoke with an account to do it
and this is not the only one

933
00:57:52,760 --> 00:57:57,040
had they can track you down to within 50
meters

934
00:57:57,040 --> 00:58:03,300
within 30 seconds all within a hundred
meters within 10 seconds

935
00:58:03,300 --> 00:58:06,590
and here by the way this is a true story

936
00:58:06,590 --> 00:58:10,120
was contacted by our investigator in
Dallas who said we were hired by a

937
00:58:10,120 --> 00:58:11,410
family

938
00:58:11,410 --> 00:58:15,190
this girl three nights ago went out to
get pizza

939
00:58:15,190 --> 00:58:18,610
for her for her job crew

940
00:58:18,610 --> 00:58:23,280
a went to the pizzeria they wouldn't
take your credit card she went to a

941
00:58:23,280 --> 00:58:28,060
cash machine took out all 100 books we
know we've got her

942
00:58:28,060 --> 00:58:32,660
ATM card usage in the photo from the
cash machine and she's disappeared

943
00:58:32,660 --> 00:58:36,009
so we plan to soften this is the actual
pinga so for that I did

944
00:58:36,010 --> 00:58:40,350
this is my pic and we found her car and
they went there they found her dead in

945
00:58:40,350 --> 00:58:41,650
the core

946
00:58:41,650 --> 00:58:44,820
sale she it was a 106 degrees in the car

947
00:58:44,820 --> 00:58:48,260
she had stopped a couple beers in the
car fell asleep in the car

948
00:58:48,260 --> 00:58:53,130
got cooked and she died but it would've
been days before the founder and

949
00:58:53,130 --> 00:58:56,310
can even imagine in a parked car in
Dallas

950
00:58:56,310 --> 00:59:01,130
where the a the engine run outta gas and
there was no

951
00:59:01,130 --> 00:59:04,660

felt

952
00:59:04,660 --> 00:59:09,210
and and i've use ping in for a lot a
case and it's an invaluable tool

anything

1071
01:06:36,150 --> 01:06:41,010
rumored okay know by the way the way
that you tell that this guy is gay just

1072
01:06:41,010 --> 01:06:41,350
for

1073
01:06:41,350 --> 01:06:45,710
those if you want to go into
investigations has nothing to do

1074
01:06:45,710 --> 01:06:49,860
with the with the gay men's health
crisis you say no

1075
01:06:49,860 --> 01:06:55,570
any literature that's only two with
databases

1076
01:06:55,570 --> 01:07:00,040
47 times easier you can download all of
this information

1077
01:07:00,040 --> 01:07:03,420
and get the same thing on your computer
almost immediately

1078
01:07:03,420 --> 01:07:07,420
lists cross referencing matching

1079
01:07:07,420 --> 01:07:11,710
can all be done in one place hiking goal
to you about marketing

1080
01:07:11,710 --> 01:07:15,260
I can go to your Facebook profile I can
go to your Apple profile

1081
01:07:15,260 --> 01:07:18,570
I can go to your myspace profile I can
go to what Google has on you

1082
01:07:18,570 --> 01:07:23,660
and determine this right away
psychographic micro targeting the big

1083
01:07:23,660 --> 01:07:24,170
sort

1084
01:07:24,170 --> 01:07:29,460
I can take stock in extrapolate out the
one example that I like to give urs

1085
01:07:29,460 --> 01:07:32,790
when VW wanted to introduce the Beagle

1086
01:07:32,790 --> 01:07:36,860
it had been a hold of a production for
so long

1087
01:07:36,860 --> 01:07:39,960
that they didn't even have must have
prior owners at work today a

1088
01:07:39,960 --> 01:07:44,960
so after the first year they surveyed
like man I mean the Germans are good at

1089
01:07:44,960 --> 01:07:47,020
it they surveyed like made

1090
01:07:47,020 --> 01:07:51,640
all of the VW orders and they found
every characteristic they could

1091
01:07:51,640 --> 01:07:54,770
are they male female white black up

1092
01:07:54,770 --> 01:07:58,740
Democrat Republican a income level
whatever

1093
01:07:58,740 --> 01:08:02,160
and they found that people who owned a
cat

1094
01:08:02,160 --> 01:08:06,660
any chunky peanut butter were three
times as likely to buy a Volkswagen

1095
01:08:06,660 --> 01:08:07,150
Beetle

1096
01:08:07,150 --> 01:08:10,690
so they bought up the peanut butter or a
list

1097
01:08:10,690 --> 01:08:14,370
and the catalysts and they cross
reference num

1098
01:08:14,370 --> 01:08:18,279
their mark in like hell to everybody who
showed up are both worse than this all

1099
01:08:18,279 --> 01:08:19,410
the time oxford's

1100
01:08:19,410 --> 01:08:22,750
this is not a joke this is really true
this is a marketing study

1101
01:08:22,750 --> 01:08:26,450
for example last

1102
01:08:26,450 --> 01:08:31,800
last election role but all the guys on
the democratic side figure out

1103
01:08:31,800 --> 01:08:34,890
butter white wine Fig Newtons fruit

Red Lobster drive a Volvo yoga you're
much more inclined to be a Hillary voter

1105
01:08:39,850 --> 01:08:43,460
re okay what up and

1106
01:08:43,460 --> 01:08:47,930

not my survey parties for truckers BMW
known ago I'm

1111
01:09:07,609 --> 01:09:11,160

lists and they would

1112
01:09:11,160 --> 01:09:16,160
proselytize the it is an amazing amazing
thing

1113
01:09:16,160 --> 01:09:19,160
amazing amazing are

1114
01:09:19,160 --> 01:09:22,819
don't have more time I now want to go

1115
01:09:22,819 --> 01:09:25,859
to this is an example of an intrusive

1116
01:09:25,859 --> 01:09:30,099
profile I no wanna go to campus cameras
are really really important

1117
01:09:30,100 --> 01:09:33,230
I'm almost certainly going to run a
couple minutes or

1118
01:09:33,230 --> 01:09:37,190
over but let's try not to this is this
area

1119
01:09:37,190 --> 01:09:41,080
right now 1998 few cameras

1120
01:09:41,080 --> 01:09:44,130
2003 2008

1121
01:09:44,130 --> 01:09:48,350
today today there are over 3,000 cameras

1122
01:09:48,350 --> 01:09:52,450
and the one square mile around Bryant
Park 3,000 jobs

1123
01:09:52,450 --> 01:09:55,650
the big thing is

1124
01:09:55,650 --> 01:09:58,780
accuracy and and

1125
01:09:58,780 --> 01:10:03,269
and resolution of the cameras facial
recognition

1126
01:10:03,270 --> 01:10:07,230
license plate recognition and analytics
Analytics is a big

1127
01:10:07,230 --> 01:10:13,970
here is Obama's inauguration here is
Obama's inauguration here is Obama's

1128
01:10:13,970 --> 01:10:16,560
inauguration that's how close you can
get

1129
01:10:16,560 --> 01:10:21,420
from that to that using something called
GigaPan

1130
01:10:21,420 --> 01:10:24,570
from that you can get to that

1131
01:10:24,570 --> 01:10:27,840
that or that I could take a picture this
room

1132
01:10:27,840 --> 01:10:31,330
a.m. with a high resolution GigaPan
camera

1133
01:10:31,330 --> 01:10:34,769
and have enough to ID everybody in your
let me give you an example

1134
01:10:34,770 --> 01:10:39,470
watch the bouncing thing this is called
GigaPan you can go to the website do

1135
01:10:39,470 --> 01:10:40,270
this yourself

1136
01:10:40,270 --> 01:10:47,270
GigaPan .co zooming in unfortunately I
was doing this on all swole Mac so

1137
01:10:47,830 --> 01:10:54,830
me take a second

1138
01:11:01,999 --> 01:11:05,050
just want you to see that I wasn't
making up these

1139
01:11:05,050 --> 01:11:08,889
these pictures now by the way I picked

1140
01:11:08,889 --> 01:11:12,030
these two guys right here as my file
photo

1141
01:11:12,030 --> 01:11:15,768
because they look kinda like mafia
Shorai with the hat

1142
01:11:15,769 --> 01:11:19,280
and the glasses was doing a job with the
secret service and he says

1143
01:11:19,280 --> 01:11:24,030
what's the story is about I said good
they were kinda creepy I want to use

1144
01:11:24,030 --> 01:11:24,659
them for

1145
01:11:24,659 --> 01:11:27,690
facial recognition example he says the
whirring

1146
01:11:27,690 --> 01:11:32,650
congress identification pertz so just so
you know these are your representatives

1147
01:11:32,650 --> 01:11:36,360
looking looking like would rely Carlo
Gambino

1148
01:11:36,360 --> 01:11:39,719
right so just so you know from

1149
01:11:39,719 --> 01:11:42,829
that to that that's where cameras are

1150
01:11:42,829 --> 01:11:47,389
right now perfect example was warned

1151
01:11:47,389 --> 01:11:52,999
1967 the first camera thirty years later

1152
01:11:52,999 --> 01:11:56,269
there are only five hundred campers 2008

1153
01:11:56,269 --> 01:12:00,249
4.2 million community safety cameras

1154
01:12:00,249 --> 01:12:04,050
it's estimated that you walk down the
street in London from point A to point B

1155
01:12:04,050 --> 01:12:09,260
no matter what your trip is your
shoulders two hundred apps drones

1156
01:12:09,260 --> 01:12:12,719

1157
01:12:12,719 --> 01:12:16,079
anywhere you wanna drone we can have

1158
01:12:16,079 --> 01:12:19,239
hydro helicopter drones

1159
01:12:19,239 --> 01:12:23,389
perpetual drones

1160
01:12:23,389 --> 01:12:27,209
little drawings that the police
department control that they can keep in

1161
01:12:27,209 --> 01:12:27,459
the

1162
01:12:27,440 --> 01:12:30,599
trying to their core drones there are

1163
01:12:30,599 --> 01:12:34,840
cyborgs that is a real more up here we
go

1164
01:12:34,840 --> 01:12:40,550
okay I hope you know what you doing no

1166
01:12:44,070 --> 01:12:48,889
flying around in first make sure you
don't kill anyone and they will use the

1167
01:12:48,889 --> 01:12:49,289
video

1168
01:12:49,289 --> 01:12:52,449
cyborg drones this is a

1169
01:12:52,449 --> 01:12:56,010
real more that they put a controller in
a camera

1170
01:12:56,010 --> 01:12:59,989
devil ray when this thing needs to
recharge

1171
01:12:59,989 --> 01:13:04,610
it throws out two wires put it on a high
tension wire

1172
01:13:04,610 --> 01:13:09,969
subset of and flies a word a

1173
01:13:09,969 --> 01:13:16,969

1174
01:13:21,030 --> 01:13:23,860
land

1175
01:13:23,860 --> 01:13:28,420
I coal mine invading your privacy but I
don't want to

1176
01:13:28,420 --> 01:13:33,090
in Bajur cranium

1177
01:13:33,090 --> 01:13:37,219
there are things that you can carry
around in a briefcase if you're on the

1178
01:13:37,219 --> 01:13:37,710
cover

1179
01:13:37,710 --> 01:13:41,260
open it all up prop it up and it takes
off in 40

1180
01:13:41,260 --> 01:13:45,940
know that's real NYPD right now has a
camera that's good enough

1181
01:13:45,940 --> 01:13:49,790
to from two miles away so far enough
where you can even

1182
01:13:49,790 --> 01:13:53,489
here the chopper look inside a car in
see what's going on they use that there

1183
01:13:53,489 --> 01:13:54,760
was a hostage standoff

1184
01:13:54,760 --> 01:13:58,440
they didn't know what happened with the
guy in the car the Aragon

1185
01:13:58,440 --> 01:14:01,760
so they brought out the chopper in the
zoomed in on the car

1186
01:14:01,760 --> 01:14:05,130
by the way at night they were able to do
it and they saw that the guy had shot

1187
01:14:05,130 --> 01:14:06,059
himself so they

1188
01:14:06,059 --> 01:14:10,520
move the issue team SWAT team and pull
them out of the car and he was

1189
01:14:10,520 --> 01:14:14,500
he was dead here's an example this is
just a couple weeks ago from Israel how

1190
01:14:14,500 --> 01:14:15,389
your own paper

1191
01:14:15,389 --> 01:14:19,409
israel was in the forefront to these
tiny tiny little drones platoon level

1192
01:14:19,409 --> 01:14:21,049
drones that they can to go with them

1193
01:14:21,050 --> 01:14:24,320
this is designed to look like a bird sir
can be used covertly

1194
01:14:24,320 --> 01:14:27,920
there it is right there there it is the
guy controlling and fly

1195
01:14:27,920 --> 01:14:31,079
by the way

1196
01:14:31,079 --> 01:14:34,639
never underestimate stupid paranoia

1197
01:14:34,639 --> 01:14:38,389
a Middle Eastern governments the turks
heard about these birds

1198
01:14:38,389 --> 01:14:42,920
and they started shooting real birds
migrating from Israel

1199
01:14:42,920 --> 01:14:46,790
and checking them for cameras and this
is an actual screenshot from Turkish TV

1200
01:14:46,790 --> 01:14:50,679
said I feel sorry for this little birdie

or am a beast will play an important
role in future warfare

1204
01:15:04,550 --> 01:15:09,059
the urban battlefield calls for tools to
increase the warfighters

1205
01:15:09,059 --> 01:15:12,949
situational awareness the capacity to
engage rapidly

1206
01:15:12,949 --> 01:15:16,239
precisely and with minimal collateral
damage

1207

future Air Force layered sensing systems

launched

1209
01:15:25,199 --> 01:15:32,199

that's really all you know

1210
01:15:34,930 --> 01:15:38,410
and communes the small size M a beast

1211
01:15:38,410 --> 01:15:42,300
allows them to be hidden in plain sight
once in place

1212
01:15:42,300 --> 01:15:46,420
and then a peek into a low-powered
extended surveillance mode

1213
01:15:46,420 --> 01:15:52,190
for missions lasting day swat weeks this
may require the in maybe to harvest

1214
01:15:52,190 --> 01:15:54,260
energy from environmental sources

1215
01:15:54,260 --> 01:15:58,200
such as sunlight or wind or from
man-made sources

1216
01:15:58,200 --> 01:16:02,719
such as power lines in vibrating
machinery which we may be limited

1217
01:16:02,719 --> 01:16:03,600
surroundings

1218
01:16:03,600 --> 01:16:09,520
and operate undetected and maybe so use
micro sensors in microprocessor

1219
01:16:09,520 --> 01:16:10,510
technology

1220
01:16:10,510 --> 01:16:14,320
to navigate track targets through a
complicated terrain

1221
01:16:14,320 --> 01:16:17,380
such as urban areas 0

1222
01:16:17,380 --> 01:16:21,120
and there may be operating in urban
terrain well have more chill the

1223
01:16:21,120 --> 01:16:23,750
challenges than larger you a beast

1224
01:16:23,750 --> 01:16:27,690
obstructions can cause wind gusts even
on a calm day

1225
01:16:27,690 --> 01:16:32,020
one way to overcome this is to learn
from examples in nature

1226
01:16:32,020 --> 01:16:35,130
venues flapping wings to fly

1227
01:16:35,130 --> 01:16:40,310
sensing an oncoming gust feedback
control directs the wings to flap

1228
01:16:40,310 --> 01:16:41,440
asymmetrically

1229
01:16:41,440 --> 01:16:47,150
compensating for the win small size an
agile flight will enable am a beast

1230
01:16:47,150 --> 01:16:51,150
to covertly and dislocations
inaccessible by traditional means have

1231
01:16:51,150 --> 01:16:52,400
aerial surveillance

1232
01:16:52,400 --> 01:16:55,800
and navies will use new forms navigation

1233
01:16:55,800 --> 01:16:59,190
such as a vision-based technique called
optic flow

1234
01:16:59,190 --> 01:17:02,850
this system remains robust when
traditional methods

1235
01:17:02,850 --> 01:17:09,850
such as GPS are unavailable multiple

1236
01:17:10,070 --> 01:17:13,450
anywhere you get the point and that is a
legitimate thing

1237
01:17:13,450 --> 01:17:16,620
arm this video presents tanks can try

1238
01:17:16,620 --> 01:17:19,840
you know what that's just up a drone
flying over

1239
01:17:19,840 --> 01:17:24,469
know by the way whoever said there's X
number of drones has no clue

1240
01:17:24,469 --> 01:17:27,980
the US Army is giving way hundreds and
hundreds and hundreds

1241
01:17:27,980 --> 01:17:32,570
have surplus drones to police forces
police forces using River

1242
01:17:32,570 --> 01:17:37,190
Texas I have an office in Roma Texas
Texas even has texas police

1243
01:17:37,190 --> 01:17:41,150
not the military even as a drawn with a
grenade launcher

1244
01:17:41,150 --> 01:17:46,310
a this is an unmanned vehicle with
Hellfire missiles

1245
01:17:46,310 --> 01:17:51,469
this is a commercial drone every
military or government drawn out there

1246
01:17:51,469 --> 01:17:55,180
there or somewhere between three to turn
commercial drones is an actual

1247
01:17:55,180 --> 01:17:56,300
commercial drone

1248
01:17:56,300 --> 01:18:00,500
these are guys using drones has
hobbyists when I was a kid launching

1249
01:18:00,500 --> 01:18:01,130
rockets

1250
01:18:01,130 --> 01:18:04,310
know people using drones as hobbyists
here's another guy

1251
01:18:04,310 --> 01:18:07,390
a hobbyist guy

1252
01:18:07,390 --> 01:18:11,250
doing a ski job this is a Sports
Illustrated drone

1253
01:18:11,250 --> 01:18:14,390
Sports Illustrated magazine has its own
drawn

1254
01:18:14,390 --> 01:18:17,980
to follow performs that is an actual

1255
01:18:17,980 --> 01:18:21,280
DRO that is the drone use or before

1256
01:18:21,280 --> 01:18:25,320
that is an actual DRO there is an actual
DRO

1257
01:18:25,320 --> 01:18:31,909
okay

1258
01:18:31,909 --> 01:18:34,089
there's something called
proof-of-concept

1259
01:18:34,090 --> 01:18:37,119
proving how frickin

1260
01:18:37,119 --> 01:18:41,938
easy it is for anybody who want no I use
drones all the terms investigated 0

1261
01:18:41,939 --> 01:18:45,579
a private investigator I use drones

1262
01:18:45,579 --> 01:18:48,938
I don't have the NSA's budget here's a
guy his cat died

loved rooms

1264
01:18:52,949 --> 01:18:58,749

1273
01:19:36,439 --> 01:19:43,439

1304
01:21:36,270 --> 01:21:39,750
analytics cameras

1305
01:21:39,750 --> 01:21:43,580
can determine what you're doing no

1306
01:21:43,580 --> 01:21:48,909
cameras can determine cameras can
determine what you doing

1307
01:21:48,909 --> 01:21:52,549
where you doing it for example it knows
this person asserting

1308
01:21:52,550 --> 01:21:56,120
this person is he doing this person is
playing

1309
01:21:56,120 --> 01:22:01,210
the funny thing is this is a schoolyard
but the product was developed by people

1310
01:22:01,210 --> 01:22:02,190
for prisons

1311
01:22:02,190 --> 01:22:06,570
so thanks this kid is making a break for
no no that's really true this is a

1312
01:22:06,570 --> 01:22:08,630
really heard from security magazine

1313
01:22:08,630 --> 01:22:11,989
facial recognition

1314
01:22:11,989 --> 01:22:15,090
every

1315
01:22:15,090 --> 01:22:18,469
state driver's license a

1316
01:22:18,469 --> 01:22:22,670
repository Department motor vehicles in
New York dps in Texas

1317
01:22:22,670 --> 01:22:26,739
is taking driver's license photos and
comparing them to mug shots

1318
01:22:26,739 --> 01:22:31,489
if you come in you apply for driver's
license you're a wanted person

1319
01:22:31,489 --> 01:22:36,409
you may not make it to the DMV are you
think the RBI is a pain in the ass now

1320
01:22:36,409 --> 01:22:42,409
way it'll real-world

1321
01:22:42,409 --> 01:22:45,739
Israel allegedly did a hit

1322
01:22:45,739 --> 01:22:49,170

01:22:59,920 --> 01:23:02,940
this is the killer this is the passport

1327
01:23:02,940 --> 01:23:05,960
old I we don't have time for the but

1328
01:23:05,960 --> 01:23:11,290
let me tell you that even RI have the
ability to use facial recognition

1329
01:23:11,290 --> 01:23:15,659
it's that simple no when I was looking
to match MySpace pages

1330
01:23:15,659 --> 01:23:19,489
to sexual predators I was able to do it

1331
01:23:19,489 --> 01:23:23,350
when I was looking to merge Illinois
deadbeat dad to MySpace and Facebook

1334
01:23:29,199 --> 01:23:29,889
guy

1335
01:23:29,889 --> 01:23:32,980
had the biggest balls you've ever seen
he used

1336
01:23:32,980 --> 01:23:37,460
his sexual offender booking photo ices
myspace for

1337
01:23:37,460 --> 01:23:42,139
not making it up

1338
01:23:42,139 --> 01:23:46,389
you can look up to the senior article
when I when are revealed this

1339
01:23:46,389 --> 01:23:49,610
wearing a disguise doesn't help

1340
01:23:49,610 --> 01:23:53,120
facial recognition on only 53

1341
01:23:53,120 --> 01:23:56,550
you can enhance a photo no facial
recognition

1342
01:23:56,550 --> 01:24:00,270
only a portion of your face is now
possible

1343
01:24:00,270 --> 01:24:05,630
even five percent knows analytics

1344
01:24:05,630 --> 01:24:09,679
I mean for me it should be a search but
for everybody

1345
01:24:09,679 --> 01:24:12,920
where your nose is on your face the
angle

1346
01:24:12,920 --> 01:24:17,139
this that it's possible just from a
nosedive ID somebody

1347
01:24:17,139 --> 01:24:20,239
I know there's a joke in there somewhere
but whatever

1348
01:24:20,239 --> 01:24:24,100
gate yeah this guy well what no I
