1
00:00:05,890 --> 00:00:06,580
well give us about

2
00:00:06,580 --> 00:00:11,370
a there's not going to be any actual
explosives it's all software

3
00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:18,370
so not to disappoint

4
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:26,500
did

5
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:31,250
my presentation software mean it to
grant a joke

6
00:00:31,250 --> 00:00:35,810
alright

7
00:00:35,810 --> 00:00:39,620
on the code it will be released in about
15 minutes at a chronic home that I

8
00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:40,330
uploaded

9
00:00:40,330 --> 00:00:46,809
so I'll get into it what I plan to go
over is

10
00:00:46,809 --> 00:00:50,550
are just a quick introduced a conocer p
up how many people are familiar

11
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:53,710
or understand Singh RP course he'll be
bored

12
00:00:53,710 --> 00:00:58,080
and then I'm gonna get even more off
topic

13
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:02,030
and then off when we talk about what is
explosive steganography

14
00:01:02,030 --> 00:01:07,050
something I kinda made up and I'll go
over all my tools and

15
00:01:07,050 --> 00:01:10,820
summarize it after that so

16
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:14,020
for those few view that are not familiar
with staying argument go over really

17
00:01:14,020 --> 00:01:18,899
ordered example it's it's based on a
true story the method not this story

18
00:01:18,899 --> 00:01:22,610
this story is completely fake but
mention it I'm in the long time ago

19
00:01:22,610 --> 00:01:26,740
BC times we have a tyrannical settlement
run East

20
00:01:26,740 --> 00:01:30,580
and we also infiltrated spies in there

21
00:01:30,580 --> 00:01:33,840
there serving %uh the actual tyrant

22
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:38,619
and we also poison over there but the
spies don't know where the poisonous so

23
00:01:38,619 --> 00:01:42,049
we gotta send diplomat into the the
country for the settlement

24
00:01:42,049 --> 00:01:45,479
tell the spies were the poisonous so

25
00:01:45,479 --> 00:01:50,229
we have our our guy

26
00:01:50,229 --> 00:01:53,460
are diplomat with his message that says
the poison is under the blue vase

27
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:56,570
so when he goes through into the
settlement

28
00:01:56,570 --> 00:02:00,840
the problem is the guards they see that
message and that happens

29
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:04,020
so

30
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:07,830
lot not only does the the messenger get
killed but then the

31
00:02:07,830 --> 00:02:10,889
actual soldiers they ignore the
poisonous to do so

32
00:02:10,890 --> 00:02:14,070
you can just even send another messenger
so

33
00:02:14,070 --> 00:02:17,640
tries again comes in with a cipher
message in this is Ken like a Caesar

34
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:20,060
cipher it's really old so no contraction

35
00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:26,239
on this still doesn't work because the
guard see this I'm cryptic message in

36
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:28,980
there still like I don't know what it is
to not let you through

37
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:33,510
it still suspicious on I guess the
benefit is they can send another

38
00:02:33,510 --> 00:02:37,489
diplomat that has a message that says
that

39
00:02:37,489 --> 00:02:41,829
I'm so this is this is kinda
steganography this is a

40
00:02:41,829 --> 00:02:45,600
hidden in plain sight there is a real
message but it's not what it looks like

41
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:49,510
so when he goes into the village the
diplomat has no anything

42
00:02:49,510 --> 00:02:52,030
I mean he had a little bit a pain in the
back of his head but he doesn't know

43
00:02:52,030 --> 00:02:52,709
what's going on

44
00:02:52,709 --> 00:02:56,310
when he goes and the spies know what to
do I'll

45
00:02:56,310 --> 00:03:00,090
okay so for something mister on now
spicer to do they share the backers

46
00:03:00,090 --> 00:03:02,239
Hannah says the poisonous under the blue
vase

47
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:06,269
and I didn't draw these props to my
friend mack

48
00:03:06,269 --> 00:03:10,329
I if any have you know I meet spend icon
is a crater that

49
00:03:10,329 --> 00:03:16,030
don't go to it

50
00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:18,650
right now

51
00:03:18,650 --> 00:03:20,540
so at in plain sight that's taken our

52
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:24,340
be on so as I going to stay in RP I'm
gonna kinda

53
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:27,370
go over my impression is taking our
pianos a lot to it and I'm just gonna go

54
00:03:27,370 --> 00:03:28,670
over my impression of it

55
00:03:28,670 --> 00:03:31,820
on ima try to go to this as quickly as
possible as long as some fear

56
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:35,700
sup modern second art B common stock
usually it's image-based if you know

57
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:37,200
that those are you familiar with it

58
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:41,980
on community the the least significant
bit method doesn't go over

59
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:45,640
on and for others liked was either
outcast a high know that

60
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:49,360
nackt that same guy he also wrote
something called no dots are no dash day

61
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:49,750
ago

62
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:53,530
on this is all going to be a Mike
Hutsell but these are actually thinks

63
00:03:53,530 --> 00:03:54,580
this is all web based

64
00:03:54,580 --> 00:03:58,370
so that no dash they are you can
actually do it well on Sep

65
00:03:58,370 --> 00:04:01,480
you got this really low resolution
picture this is supposed to be about

66
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:04,600
four by four picks all image with some
red

67
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:07,860
some other and some green now

68
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:12,250
those are the the values a it CI 0
through 255

69
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:16,260
for your shades are red green and blue
so you notice that the mid

70
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:19,659
or that the kinda dark a red that 227
for the reading all those

71
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:23,330
and they don't have anything for green
or blue on for the green that's also

72
00:04:23,330 --> 00:04:26,550
have turned on so it's green pixels you
have a hundred points him for that

73
00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:29,830
and for your break reddit's only turned
on to 255 preach

74
00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:34,320
so what would happen if I say took to
the green down to a couple notches said

75
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:35,730
took it down to like 65

76
00:04:35,730 --> 00:04:39,150
it's going to be a a much darker shade
but say only took it down to

77
00:04:39,150 --> 00:04:42,890
so I want me senator don't want to miss
six are visually snuggle with a much

78
00:04:42,890 --> 00:04:43,310
different

79
00:04:43,310 --> 00:04:47,070
and that's the secret so if you wanted
to hide some information in there

80
00:04:47,070 --> 00:04:50,500
binary information we could say
something like all the

81
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:53,660
even numbers are going to be ones nor
the art or

82
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:57,000
even numbers will share who is or is not
numbers anyone's so

83
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,520
thats three different colors per pixel
to multiplayer doubt thats

84
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:04,520
48 bits snow a lot but it's still
something and visually won't notice it

85
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:08,830
so strap a message in there on in binary
and those are the ones that the roses

86
00:05:08,830 --> 00:05:09,789
are 41 scissor

87
00:05:09,790 --> 00:05:14,940
ones and zeros in ASCII thats hope
number nine so those are the ones and

88
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:16,740
zeros are we can fit into each pixel

89
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:20,180
this is the new image we you can't on
the first

90
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:23,800
pixel appear we each we cranked up read
by one

91
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:26,820
and even added one for dream and if I go
back

92
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:30,760
so that would be a 010 2010

93
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:33,719
that's what we're doing right there and
we do throughout the whole thing so we

94
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:34,750
actually embedded

95
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:38,110
hope number nine in our four by four
pixel image

96
00:05:38,110 --> 00:05:41,930
and that's the new image was not much of
a difference

97
00:05:41,930 --> 00:05:45,630
its it's almost that simple there's
there's more complicated methods but

98
00:05:45,630 --> 00:05:46,229
that's a

99
00:05:46,229 --> 00:05:50,599
my ping in a simple and understand are
here's another favorite method of mind

100
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:53,840
this isn't your typical for
steganography but I I like this example

101
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:55,280
because it's our

102
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:58,350
really illustrating out-of-band Contax

103
00:05:58,350 --> 00:06:02,880
so books I for the message itself when I
actually even inserting anything in

104
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:03,260
there

105
00:06:03,260 --> 00:06:07,390
Carter scared or anything %uh the
original message is still the original

106
00:06:07,390 --> 00:06:09,520
message the secret is in the context

107
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:13,690
so the books I for on we have our
contacts which is the blew up at the top

108
00:06:13,690 --> 00:06:14,340
there

109
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:18,080
it's it's referring to you the first
letter up what word

110
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:21,820
so for like the forty-fifth Warren
there'll be a GE

111
00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:25,340
about an easy example the scan if you're
looking at it is say are

112
00:06:25,340 --> 00:06:28,810
for that second jumping up 49 60 the six

113
00:06:28,810 --> 00:06:32,310
because the six words to 12 3456
respecting

114
00:06:32,310 --> 00:06:35,510
arm so that's the are in the word for

115
00:06:35,510 --> 00:06:40,630
go for smaller parts but the seeker
message on in a min at

116
00:06:40,630 --> 00:06:44,789
get more details on the whole idea of
are meaning and in context

117
00:06:44,789 --> 00:06:48,930
data doesn't have meaning in less
there's context to go with it

118
00:06:48,930 --> 00:06:52,130
so these ones and zeroes here are
meaningless

119
00:06:52,130 --> 00:06:56,729
without the right context and for those
that have memorized ASCII chart

120
00:06:56,729 --> 00:06:59,830
you're probably trying to decode that
right now thinking what that means on

121
00:06:59,830 --> 00:07:02,560
but thats think that ass bitch are is
the context

122
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:06,510
so that is still meaningless unless you
interpreted with ASCII so we'll do that

123
00:07:06,510 --> 00:07:10,570
we have ASCII are which in hex to be the
fourth 4444

124
00:07:10,570 --> 00:07:15,130
an unprintable that be the word on so

125
00:07:15,130 --> 00:07:18,830
let's take a look at it in a different
context same message

126
00:07:18,830 --> 00:07:22,210
base64 another up

127
00:07:22,210 --> 00:07:26,870
coding scheme that a lot you're probably
aware of eyes and indexing scheme so it

128
00:07:26,870 --> 00:07:27,849
goes from

129
00:07:27,849 --> 00:07:31,150
like a through C capital A through Z
lower case

130
00:07:31,150 --> 00:07:35,180
and eyes are there nine and a couple
Tuesday to special characters

131
00:07:35,180 --> 00:07:39,480
I think I have that right cell what this
would translate to

132
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:44,310
is the worked or but leets picked up
because the

133
00:07:44,310 --> 00:07:48,830
was actually 0 but my point is the data
itself it just it's all about

134
00:07:48,830 --> 00:07:49,669
interpretation

135
00:07:49,669 --> 00:07:53,639
so its it's really tough game was taken
our fee

136
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:57,210
yapping about ok essence they hide on
you you can

137
00:07:57,210 --> 00:08:00,660
use some other anti-radar steganography
tools to

138
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:04,410
recovering but if you don't know the
context it's really difficult

139
00:08:04,410 --> 00:08:07,460
even though I would say that nothing is
in a vacum

140
00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:11,260
you can eventually arrive at us another

141
00:08:11,260 --> 00:08:14,820
idea that confuses even more in this is
me getting off track

142
00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:19,360
are its ap a pina it's that idea of
finding meaning and meaningless data

143
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:22,690
so this image here we got a few cars
here you can kinda see that

144
00:08:22,690 --> 00:08:27,520
but and all read the license plates up
for the person who have PDF 225

145
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:32,790
yep 512 256 and then you have 337 CCG

146
00:08:32,789 --> 00:08:36,098
on but doesn't mean anything next slide

147
00:08:36,099 --> 00:08:41,530
so this more a knack but we have this
guy studying history sign

148
00:08:41,530 --> 00:08:44,850
this is kinda VAP opinion but can I i
mean we got out between the avenue is

149
00:08:44,850 --> 00:08:45,740
looking to hear but

150
00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:49,400
he studying the timings %uh the red and
green lights he wants to see if there's

151
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:50,600
any pattern in that

152
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:54,880
so you know as a table here we have the
a much different times were marking way

153
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:58,720
when it was red one is green the the
time frames and how long

154
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:02,940
we we can go from the times to figuring
out how long each one is rendering

155
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:05,970
and I have kinda highlighted their a the

156
00:09:05,970 --> 00:09:10,280
one-time the red light wasn't on

157
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:14,010
as long as it usually is it's an anomaly

158
00:09:14,010 --> 00:09:18,829
suppose I mean uses anomaly he tracks
how many other times it happens

159
00:09:18,829 --> 00:09:22,440
so spread out through time like about
half a year happen

160
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:25,930
six times that exact same anomaly
happened six more times in the report

161
00:09:25,930 --> 00:09:27,120
the times

162
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:31,110
and he's still wondering what does this
mean and a Guinness apart my point is

163
00:09:31,110 --> 00:09:34,449
the context can be out-of-band it might
not mean anything unless you're looking

164
00:09:34,449 --> 00:09:36,319
at the right context

165
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:39,780
so want to cross reference it with the
weather that day

166
00:09:39,780 --> 00:09:42,880
we have 72 degrees 79 eighty as a guest
to

167
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:46,140
because your winter 69 3557

168
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:50,810
of you convert that to a decimal on
ASCII

169
00:09:50,810 --> 00:09:56,170
then we hope number nine

170
00:09:56,170 --> 00:09:59,400
and this is a star obscurely

171
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:02,579
illustrating that when you have a lot of
data

172
00:10:02,579 --> 00:10:06,660
and you don't know the context exactly
meaning as a

173
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:11,860
really significant idea

174
00:10:11,860 --> 00:10:15,670
so out those quick enough hope they have
time here

175
00:10:15,670 --> 00:10:19,250
%uh explosive steganography up these
these tools

176
00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:22,800
it this term i not even be cracked I
made it up it's not

177
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:26,510
steganography in the general sense for
the term love you want it to be

178
00:10:26,510 --> 00:10:31,730
I not noticeable this is very noisy
steganography so it's almost like

179
00:10:31,730 --> 00:10:35,810
not stay in RP but I don't know what
else to call us

180
00:10:35,810 --> 00:10:40,010
so a pictorial analogy a Where's Waldo

181
00:10:40,010 --> 00:10:44,300
by steganography to me world's worst 10
while there would be the second order p

182
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:48,150
he's is hidden but in plain sight
thinking kinda fine I mean OD looks like

183
00:10:48,150 --> 00:10:49,360
that might take awhile

184
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:52,480
so explain explosive steganography is
kinda more like

185
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:56,730
that up you want to avoid that

186
00:10:56,730 --> 00:11:03,730
and the seeker message is in there

187
00:11:04,170 --> 00:11:07,810
so I'll go to the first tool thought and
each one might suppose it's a

188
00:11:07,810 --> 00:11:12,100
they're all written in Perl I was mostly
just learning the language

189
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:16,540
and playing around don't take any this
seriously I'm not trying to make Israel

190
00:11:16,540 --> 00:11:21,730
a awesome tools or anything I just did
all this with kind ever

191
00:11:21,730 --> 00:11:25,630
kinda evil said in mind I guess so

192
00:11:25,630 --> 00:11:30,020
with our car bombs all talk about my
first torches is easy upload like

193
00:11:30,020 --> 00:11:35,130
knows it but is a port are and before I
talk about to log on with a history of

194
00:11:35,130 --> 00:11:37,329
archive bounces and something that I
made up

195
00:11:37,329 --> 00:11:40,800
a I think the most well-known one is
self 42 does it then it's

196
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:43,990
I think it's called that because the
actual zip file is 42 K

197
00:11:43,990 --> 00:11:48,829
so 42 does it it is a file that we open
it up has 16 or zip files

198
00:11:48,829 --> 00:11:52,000
live 0: that one but two you gonna be
one of those

199
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:56,740
and you have book 10 but one but two and
so on you go in there you got 16 was

200
00:11:56,740 --> 00:11:59,420
about chapter 0 chapter one chapter two
and so on

201
00:11:59,420 --> 00:12:02,939
you go on any of those you got 16
moore's if our stock zero dark or not

202
00:12:02,940 --> 00:12:03,930
%um

203
00:12:03,930 --> 00:12:08,089
going to their you got 16 more zip files
page 0 page1 page2 non

204
00:12:08,089 --> 00:12:11,450
you go on any one of those and you've
got

205
00:12:11,450 --> 00:12:14,520
a 16-gigabyte file

206
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:18,230
I did make this tool

207
00:12:18,230 --> 00:12:21,470
are why like that or there's a couple
limitations in that

208
00:12:21,470 --> 00:12:26,080
inside they're all zip files I and you
get a hierarchy was a policy

209
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:30,040
it's not gonna typically must archive
tools are gonna workers simply extract a

210
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:31,099
serb you extract

211
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:34,940
all it is going to get the first 16 zip
files in there only like about thirty

212
00:12:34,940 --> 00:12:37,399
case assembly gonna do a whole lot

213
00:12:37,399 --> 00:12:41,940
arm and not that the so things
limitation but I want to be more

214
00:12:41,940 --> 00:12:44,070
configurable syrup my aunt or

215
00:12:44,070 --> 00:12:48,709
are I use just the normal van
authorities bit so has some limitations

216
00:12:48,709 --> 00:12:51,839
4.3 gates and it is the most any file
inside can be

217
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:55,080
and you can only have 65535 files which

218
00:12:55,080 --> 00:13:00,410
limited him your tuna 56 terabytes
inside

219
00:13:00,410 --> 00:13:03,439
on this is kinda up loose

220
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:07,070
example of how a file might work on a
file system you got your data and the

221
00:13:07,070 --> 00:13:07,970
blue but he also

222
00:13:07,970 --> 00:13:11,390
metadata which is in part an actual file
itself are depending on higher file

223
00:13:11,390 --> 00:13:14,260
system handles it but it's a separate
from the pilots metadata

224
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:18,450
on up data so you know describing the
filesize the named a permissions and all

225
00:13:18,450 --> 00:13:19,300
that

226
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:22,850
the substructures kinda complicated I
had a kinda reverse engineer and

227
00:13:22,850 --> 00:13:25,980
at wikipedia: helped a little bit away
but not all the way I had to do a lot

228
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:26,920
about

229
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:31,160
lot of tax lots attacks had a like copy
and hacks and then

230
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:34,640
change bites at a time to figure out
what was doing what is horrible

231
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:39,010
a but so this is an example uva at as a
file has two

232
00:13:39,010 --> 00:13:43,380
files inside it and that's the two blue
parts there it's a compressed data

233
00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:46,540
on and it is its kinda redundant a

234
00:13:46,540 --> 00:13:49,589
on purpose but you have a couple hundred
in the beginning

235
00:13:49,589 --> 00:13:52,870
and you have some other headers and mid
metadata in the middle

236
00:13:52,870 --> 00:13:57,149
and you have a footer so for a header
the typical kinda supper houses like the

237
00:13:57,149 --> 00:13:59,980
PK level label from a peak is here but
still

238
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:03,550
still there are what kinda archives
offer

239
00:14:03,550 --> 00:14:07,080
it's compatible with what became a
compression method it uses

240
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:10,630
you next time codes here see the check
some arm

241
00:14:10,630 --> 00:14:14,360
the compressed file size: uncompressed
file size which is just reporting to the

242
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:16,660
archiver it can be faked which I did

243
00:14:16,660 --> 00:14:20,850
on in the file names and then you got
your

244
00:14:20,850 --> 00:14:26,140
kinda middle medidata its kinda the same
but you also have like a pointer to the

245
00:14:26,140 --> 00:14:28,779
internal memory location that the files
stored at

246
00:14:28,779 --> 00:14:33,070
on and senate attributes I

247
00:14:33,070 --> 00:14:36,980
any up for that other smaller minute mid
metadata by Caroline order does not like

248
00:14:36,980 --> 00:14:39,430
eric has a minute to go to speak to know
anyway

249
00:14:39,430 --> 00:14:42,870
and the footer is also kinda complicated
mathematically if you reverse

250
00:14:42,870 --> 00:14:43,890
engineering at

251
00:14:43,890 --> 00:14:46,970
are else has a point a pointer to
internal memory

252
00:14:46,970 --> 00:14:52,519
are where the mid metadata starts and
also the total file size limit metadata

253
00:14:52,519 --> 00:14:55,620
Cir structure for all those players not
set you have

254
00:14:55,620 --> 00:14:59,080
your metadata this this first redline

255
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:03,320
refers to that first pilot their supply
store that starts data wise

256
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:07,140
in her second part points the second
file and then your footer points and

257
00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:09,360
beginning at the midnight a data and
also to the

258
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:12,649
tall size on so the problem with this
from me

259
00:15:12,649 --> 00:15:16,610
by doing a standard was if I have a 4.3
gay file compressed it's about a

260
00:15:16,610 --> 00:15:21,010
four megabyte file was it on and have to
keep repeating that over and over and

261
00:15:21,010 --> 00:15:22,339
over and over and over again

262
00:15:22,339 --> 00:15:26,730
never pretty large zip file for I mean
it's not an expert but a bit but

263
00:15:26,730 --> 00:15:31,200
still I want 256 terabytes a and I'm
gonna have like up

264
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:36,480
as a pilot a few gigs that still wasn't
good enough for me side a trip

265
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:39,740
so what actually did was dynamically

266
00:15:39,740 --> 00:15:43,420
for however many files you want inside I
had all been made metadata

267
00:15:43,420 --> 00:15:46,480
planning to the same file over and over
and over and over and over again

268
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:52,360
a typical archive supper will not make
up I like that for you

269
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:59,209
saludame

270
00:15:59,209 --> 00:16:04,410
and I'll try to make this big

271
00:16:04,410 --> 00:16:11,410
that's as big as a minute

272
00:16:17,189 --> 00:16:20,849
try to make a extensive use ever are
appears on to type I

273
00:16:20,850 --> 00:16:24,170
each man's but I have to turn on a peon
area

274
00:16:24,170 --> 00:16:27,480
sup

275
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:30,740
meron is a Plone actually take the back

276
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:37,740
it's going to be a director that only in
aka

277
00:16:40,019 --> 00:16:42,879
gonna run it don't want to help are
gonna say

278
00:16:42,879 --> 00:16:47,079
the total amount of hours I can do a
65535

279
00:16:47,079 --> 00:16:51,220
of file names and now the conventional
DC I am kinda like a on

280
00:16:51,220 --> 00:16:54,860
pictures on the camera take folks
tensions will be JK on

281
00:16:54,860 --> 00:16:59,129
and up I'll be pictures does it some
running it Iran

282
00:16:59,129 --> 00:17:03,089
and

283
00:17:03,089 --> 00:17:07,600
go into that folder a pic yes

284
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:10,770
exam their is our pictures does it

285
00:17:10,770 --> 00:17:13,889
open it up it's going to take

286
00:17:13,890 --> 00:17:20,890
maybe ten seconds they are

287
00:17:23,790 --> 00:17:27,670
not can extract all would take a while
anyway it's not good for presentations

288
00:17:27,670 --> 00:17:30,880
but you can see at the bottom here on
may actually probably can't

289
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:34,430
ice is 281 .5 terabytes

290
00:17:34,430 --> 00:17:37,490
and the day

291
00:17:37,490 --> 00:17:41,180
is our apps no

292
00:17:41,180 --> 00:17:45,500
defaulted so it's November 11 to two
thousand

293
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:52,500
11 so that's the the prankster version
other

294
00:17:58,230 --> 00:18:01,679
and actually yeah all these tools I
would use the prankster version and the

295
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:02,960
stake in RP version

296
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:06,400
like kinda has been he said one %uh the
good things to do not to throw people

297
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:06,850
off

298
00:18:06,850 --> 00:18:10,709
is to give them more work this the stuff
isn't going to be perfect

299
00:18:10,710 --> 00:18:15,230
so E you can't hide forever but if you
give them a lot of stuff that doesn't

300
00:18:15,230 --> 00:18:16,789
even have a secret message in it

301
00:18:16,789 --> 00:18:20,620
its gonna give more work so I I would
use all his tools in combination with

302
00:18:20,620 --> 00:18:21,669
actual steganography

303
00:18:21,669 --> 00:18:25,809
on another tool next also

304
00:18:25,809 --> 00:18:29,590
if you download this out this
presentation I have screenshots of 12

305
00:18:29,590 --> 00:18:34,899
I'm not gonna go in town says it now

306
00:18:34,899 --> 00:18:38,100
that's other tool that goes along with
his floats can the same thing

307
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:41,789
but it actually makes epic a PK header

308
00:18:41,789 --> 00:18:45,149
and put secret information in there and
its a as: in cryptid

309
00:18:45,149 --> 00:18:48,970
so the file structures gonna same but
the bottom have a pic PK signature and

310
00:18:48,970 --> 00:18:53,130
steganography some well-run

311
00:18:53,130 --> 00:18:57,760
actually

312
00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:01,690
Brenda we got over files in there we got
a plain text file

313
00:19:01,690 --> 00:19:06,520
there is seek a message via to as a text
associate at first

314
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:09,750
some Iran's

315
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:14,020
mile Ninject plain text and out file
will be

316
00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:18,230
compressed as a and the host file is
forty does it so

317
00:19:18,230 --> 00:19:21,809
me a piggyback off for that so certain
not destructive process

318
00:19:21,809 --> 00:19:26,510
so around it we have compressed or
zipped

319
00:19:26,510 --> 00:19:32,210
an actual show you compress does a

320
00:19:32,210 --> 00:19:35,909
there is

321
00:19:35,909 --> 00:19:39,899
10 a clearer chapter 0

322
00:19:39,899 --> 00:19:46,899
yeah I don't waste your time

323
00:19:52,540 --> 00:19:55,879
so it's gonna look at the a kind of a
specific text on but what I have in

324
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:57,440
their I don't use encryption this time

325
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:00,630
are the only reason I added a feature
not using encryption was just for

326
00:20:00,630 --> 00:20:02,980
demonstration purposes otherwise I'd
recommend always using it

327
00:20:02,980 --> 00:20:08,429
I got a shrink this a little more

328
00:20:08,429 --> 00:20:11,760
okay

329
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:14,790
so over them the lower and

330
00:20:14,790 --> 00:20:21,790
you'll see a secret message was going to
text

331
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:29,430
cinnamon extract it so

332
00:20:29,430 --> 00:20:34,059
use extract on I'm gonna use compressors
it that's what I wanna grab outta

333
00:20:34,059 --> 00:20:39,580
Angela go to da crib did not text so in
the crib did not extend their

334
00:20:39,580 --> 00:20:44,899
it see your message for 200 X

335
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:49,270
I just to show that I'm not lying

336
00:20:49,270 --> 00:20:53,160
I will do this with encryption this time

337
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:57,610
the pastoral be lol your

338
00:20:57,610 --> 00:21:03,679
camp you can anything that starts with O

339
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:10,679
the letter why works so

340
00:21:11,590 --> 00:21:15,199
same same thing but I use a pastor this
time so

341
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:18,470
in the same location there looks like
garbage cuz shes and Krypton

342
00:21:18,470 --> 00:21:25,470
and show that i can reply back out

343
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:33,830
there is

344
00:21:33,830 --> 00:21:39,060
so now move to the next interesting tool
hiding

345
00:21:39,060 --> 00:21:42,580
an illness so having secret messages and
on us

346
00:21:42,580 --> 00:21:45,870
are things that look like viruses but
aren't really

347
00:21:45,870 --> 00:21:49,660
they're actually pretty benign so the
first or the prankster version but all

348
00:21:49,660 --> 00:21:53,080
hips knees but

349
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:56,350
it generates a user-defined Amanda
viruses %uh viruses

350
00:21:56,350 --> 00:22:00,780
I they're all false positives I just
grabbed not a clam AB's dictionary but I

351
00:22:00,780 --> 00:22:02,510
I removed all the ones that are actually

352
00:22:02,510 --> 00:22:07,060
hey maybe specific on and the thing that
took a little bit work for on my and was

353
00:22:07,060 --> 00:22:11,310
amid all the files Cano looker Act three
also execute laws will execute PDF so

354
00:22:11,310 --> 00:22:13,659
often as PDF zip files will resemble

355
00:22:13,660 --> 00:22:17,260
are not see it and our ties it on if
anybody's her that but that's amazing

356
00:22:17,260 --> 00:22:19,100
it's over cursive zip file so

357
00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:22,140
when you open it what's inside is a
folder called

358
00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:25,380
are and he open the folder are does it
was inside a bit

359
00:22:25,380 --> 00:22:29,020
if you open up our ties a on and on and
on amazing

360
00:22:29,020 --> 00:22:32,340
on

361
00:22:32,340 --> 00:22:35,570
go a few features but you'll see a tarp

362
00:22:35,570 --> 00:22:38,919
wanna call once and added later was a
feature called spread so if you have a

363
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:42,090
bunch of files on this randomly pick the
file type C dot to define it

364
00:22:42,090 --> 00:22:45,800
on you can have each file can have more
than one signatures

365
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:49,590
in it just so I could read it again
spires total you go the more fidelity

366
00:22:49,590 --> 00:22:52,860
on you could add random padding to make
a little bit more real

367
00:22:52,860 --> 00:22:56,780
and then another tool are or another
switch ignited a sucker punch which is

368
00:22:56,780 --> 00:22:57,810
actually not random

369
00:22:57,810 --> 00:23:01,149
by it ads like a carefully

370
00:23:01,150 --> 00:23:04,740
crafted a concoction up signatures that
are

371
00:23:04,740 --> 00:23:08,350
will raise the fidelity in Barcelona by
around 30 to 42

372
00:23:08,350 --> 00:23:12,020
or are so sucker punch was actually a
name that my friend at work

373
00:23:12,020 --> 00:23:15,080
rubin a sup would be funny

374
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:19,960
so so is why is it well the funny stuff
but also you can can ease as a more

375
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:20,690
powerful

376
00:23:20,690 --> 00:23:24,660
by the i-car which I wouldn't do it in a
actual job environment but for personal

377
00:23:24,660 --> 00:23:25,310
reasons

378
00:23:25,310 --> 00:23:28,500
fun I did a 1,000,000 have sneeze now is
kinda funny

379
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:32,480
on and again for the friends
exaggeration

380
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:38,600
like make them more and before a show
your tool

381
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:42,550
just not related to expose a second I
give people something interesting I know

382
00:23:42,550 --> 00:23:43,560
this was combining

383
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:48,760
virus definitions up at and I wanted to
get forty under 40 on mars total but I

384
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:51,720
can't quite make it says like what
happens after that yeah I coroner

385
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:54,880
ever you know every buyer so vendor
should pick that up

386
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:58,080
but euro didn't but they're kinda
different they're kinda a heuristic only

387
00:23:58,080 --> 00:23:58,439
but

388
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:02,930
it worked and a but what I notices for
the ones before on

389
00:24:02,930 --> 00:24:06,880
that we're showing the real trojans and
viruses the a car seemed kinda override

390
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:07,340
that

391
00:24:07,340 --> 00:24:10,370
on which okay whatever I put your car in
front

392
00:24:10,370 --> 00:24:13,400
weapons if I put your car in the back of
my my whole file

393
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:17,960
are well all the better still kinda CE I
car before the sea

394
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:20,980
real church in some viruses I don't know
why

395
00:24:20,980 --> 00:24:27,550
prolly not a big deal but it is still
kinda interesting socially this tool

396
00:24:27,550 --> 00:24:30,649
is this

397
00:24:30,650 --> 00:24:37,650
is just too small at might be for people
that there are no

398
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:51,770
ok it I'm running the heads news to all

399
00:24:51,770 --> 00:24:55,270
are saliva as the switch for how many
you ought

400
00:24:55,270 --> 00:24:58,900
so already we're gonna do it sneeze have
30 files

401
00:24:58,900 --> 00:25:03,210
a at name they're all this going to have
a found him a totally legit program

402
00:25:03,210 --> 00:25:07,980
and I are gonna run spread 30

403
00:25:07,980 --> 00:25:11,350
there is all art totally legit programs

404
00:25:11,350 --> 00:25:15,110
and

405
00:25:15,110 --> 00:25:19,539
tree I had the folder from Maya

406
00:25:19,539 --> 00:25:26,539
shared folder on the desktop but it got
cut off so

407
00:25:31,620 --> 00:25:34,750
and I'll go back in the file system here
stick them I'll

408
00:25:34,750 --> 00:25:38,290
sneezes there's over sneezes

409
00:25:38,290 --> 00:25:45,290
spoiler the role in

410
00:25:51,490 --> 00:25:54,410
share okay if so to lose our program 1

411
00:25:54,410 --> 00:25:57,970
it's a next people double click it run

412
00:25:57,970 --> 00:26:04,170
Cup but ownership program Tunis all
random

413
00:26:04,170 --> 00:26:08,690
but our that is a VBS script run

414
00:26:08,690 --> 00:26:13,250
Cup a

415
00:26:13,250 --> 00:26:16,660
screensaver Ron doesn't do anything

416
00:26:16,660 --> 00:26:20,450
but doesn't there so that's cool I

417
00:26:20,450 --> 00:26:24,030
PDF yeah

418
00:26:24,030 --> 00:26:27,110
a

419
00:26:27,110 --> 00:26:30,400
and then there's one more year as a
files so yet

420
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:37,400
are are legit are resident and yet

421
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:47,040
and ensure the most important part clams
can so

422
00:26:49,130 --> 00:26:53,390
scan files 30 infected files 30 but yeah

423
00:26:53,390 --> 00:26:56,650
if you really know what you're doing
carrier a good

424
00:26:56,650 --> 00:27:00,610
now our analyst thats not really current
stuff its or

425
00:27:00,610 --> 00:27:07,610
history but it's still kinda funny so
the other tool

426
00:27:10,330 --> 00:27:15,600
stay apart have a sore it does the same
thing as news does but

427
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:22,600
you can put stay on it let's do that

428
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:30,309
its first save me time writer whose or

429
00:27:30,309 --> 00:27:34,450
gonna share needle which means encrypt
or inject his right knee and captions

430
00:27:34,450 --> 00:27:35,540
time too so you can see it

431
00:27:35,540 --> 00:27:38,889
and the CIA on time might skip the

432
00:27:38,890 --> 00:27:42,290
the actual caption parts to see an A on

433
00:27:42,290 --> 00:27:47,059
you guys trust me right that action prep
stuff now I i just wanna go over

434
00:27:47,059 --> 00:27:50,928
on time on and I want you guys to see
worst putting into hiding

435
00:27:50,929 --> 00:27:54,940
so we're going to the plain text i text
file up I'll be monster

436
00:27:54,940 --> 00:27:59,600
and will be da txt 08

437
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:06,600
back out run again okay

438
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:13,800
so we have monster DX in there and clams
Canada

439
00:28:22,059 --> 00:28:25,350
on that that's awesome

440
00:28:25,350 --> 00:28:32,159
I seventy two leaders in files awesome
side effect over 250 6 terabytes if I'll

441
00:28:32,159 --> 00:28:39,159
virus scans take a while lambskin

442
00:28:47,130 --> 00:28:50,150
see lot quicker sewer

443
00:28:50,150 --> 00:28:55,660
it was months already exceed it it's all
random so this time there was trivial

444
00:28:55,660 --> 00:28:58,800
dash 177 where that is and I don't know
what I'm doing so

445
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:02,560
whatever I'm actually yeah I should say
that I'm not

446
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:05,639
a friend 6 expert not even a second I
refuse expert

447
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:12,640
I'm out London

448
00:29:12,700 --> 00:29:18,190
alright so

449
00:29:18,190 --> 00:29:22,559
I'll show you what that looks like that
was a and execute all I'm

450
00:29:22,559 --> 00:29:27,668
I'm running xx the on an ex-senator I'm
only telling the last %uh 16 lines have

451
00:29:27,669 --> 00:29:27,980
it

452
00:29:27,980 --> 00:29:32,710
it's actually pretty big file but what I
noticed that the day executed well the

453
00:29:32,710 --> 00:29:35,169
temple to use for it I am 8 in c plus
plus

454
00:29:35,169 --> 00:29:39,440
and I realize that after a buncha if you
had a bunch in north and even

455
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:44,000
you can put arbitrary suffered and so
persuaded section really unsophisticated

456
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:47,539
on and just to save time just imagined
that are

457
00:29:47,539 --> 00:29:51,070
the that part at the bottom there is a
cryptid

458
00:29:51,070 --> 00:29:58,070
on and then I got extracted

459
00:30:07,950 --> 00:30:14,950
president out not txt so sorry mister to
as a text

460
00:30:16,140 --> 00:30:19,210
that's next ones my favorite cuz arm

461
00:30:19,210 --> 00:30:23,550
I don't know if it's really been done
are I try to research it afterwards

462
00:30:23,550 --> 00:30:27,510
and let's confine anything so it's out
there it's it's hidden but arm

463
00:30:27,510 --> 00:30:32,110
I was abusing scalpel on the two-lane
road is called Magic on

464
00:30:32,110 --> 00:30:36,740
the non stay over in a bit so talk about
scalpels and how it works a little bit

465
00:30:36,740 --> 00:30:41,180
scuffles art something you do I know you
may not be alright rely on the file

466
00:30:41,180 --> 00:30:42,370
system or the metadata

467
00:30:42,370 --> 00:30:45,110
tell you what you're looking at only
have his data see if you can look at the

468
00:30:45,110 --> 00:30:46,140
headers and footers and

469
00:30:46,140 --> 00:30:49,790
kinda signatures a what the file looks
like simplest example

470
00:30:49,790 --> 00:30:52,760
would be aged unknown sure a lot of
people familiar with that produce

471
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:54,600
looking too much raw data and you see
the

472
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:58,550
beginning HTML tag in an HTML tag it's
probably an HTML file

473
00:30:58,550 --> 00:31:01,600
so pal cover will karol the middle

474
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:04,680
and save it as a doc HTML and thats

475
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:08,390
a release simplistic version of our how
scalpel works

476
00:31:08,390 --> 00:31:11,450
are and that's a scuffle configuration
file

477
00:31:11,450 --> 00:31:15,050
on I kinda highlighted the aged him at

478
00:31:15,050 --> 00:31:19,159
ish a.m. a definition for its already
have the HTML on

479
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:22,390
than that and tagged for it not fifty
thousand

480
00:31:22,390 --> 00:31:27,210
but if understand right basically says
if it goes if you have more than fifty

481
00:31:27,210 --> 00:31:28,040
came down to

482
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:32,110
just cut it off it and they're by that
comes in handy when you have signatures

483
00:31:32,110 --> 00:31:33,390
that don't have a flutter

484
00:31:33,390 --> 00:31:37,400
my car the neck media flash definition
up there this one says stop after four

485
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:38,010
makes

486
00:31:38,010 --> 00:31:42,060
so the question is what happens when you
get data that works like that

487
00:31:42,060 --> 00:31:46,470
they have an HTML found there you also
have a another header in there for

488
00:31:46,470 --> 00:31:49,850
the shockwave but I don't have a

489
00:31:49,850 --> 00:31:54,620
not a footer on what it was couple who
what it does is it ok are not the

490
00:31:54,620 --> 00:31:55,580
original file

491
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:58,730
but it also will carve out that flash
file

492
00:31:58,730 --> 00:32:02,750
so you can I get a false positive in
this case because

493
00:32:02,750 --> 00:32:05,960
are as you can see in this age ten of
our early intending to carve out a flash

494
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:06,470
file

495
00:32:06,470 --> 00:32:10,530
it's not a flash file but it still
covered out so happens when your file

496
00:32:10,530 --> 00:32:11,399
looks like that

497
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:14,490
to file that's only headers and only
furthers

498
00:32:14,490 --> 00:32:18,190
no actual content on as early a lot of
false positives

499
00:32:18,190 --> 00:32:23,830
and it's actually really bad it's it's
worse than archive on

500
00:32:23,830 --> 00:32:29,740
so the toilet just so you know how many
are only given it an actual

501
00:32:29,740 --> 00:32:33,150
scalpel dot com piled atop what kinda
policy want to get to give headers and

502
00:32:33,150 --> 00:32:33,660
footers

503
00:32:33,660 --> 00:32:37,110
and then it all in Utah how many times
you want to repeat

504
00:32:37,110 --> 00:32:40,250
and you wanna go and you can also add
random padding but

505
00:32:40,250 --> 00:32:43,429
ought to make it look more convincing
but it does lower the fidelity a little

506
00:32:43,429 --> 00:32:43,790
bit

507
00:32:43,790 --> 00:32:47,800
so to get some practical example say we
have a mp3 dot com file

508
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:52,080
on and the configuration would look like
a about their it's just the mp3's

509
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:52,929
extension

510
00:32:52,929 --> 00:32:57,460
are don't car more than 8 it makes which
is kinda reasonable

511
00:32:57,460 --> 00:33:01,929
for mp3 and the tag it or the headers ID
30 notice that on

512
00:33:01,929 --> 00:33:05,730
mp3 is if you look at Annex entered a
plea almost all star 33

513
00:33:05,730 --> 00:33:09,350
on so running the tool the command looks
like that

514
00:33:09,350 --> 00:33:12,910
are numismatic bomb gonna do ten times
in

515
00:33:12,910 --> 00:33:18,200
I use mp3 dot com thin but it out I did
Ian have a hard drive so

516
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:22,310
art but for this is the kinda targeted
and so using this to defaults couple

517
00:33:22,310 --> 00:33:22,899
icon

518
00:33:22,900 --> 00:33:27,650
well we're targeting this mp3 bomb for
on an investigator that might see a box

519
00:33:27,650 --> 00:33:29,550
or a computer that looks like that

520
00:33:29,550 --> 00:33:33,120
arm but so how early works up

521
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:37,000
we get this %uh tech we did it 10 times
and we got this so file this 30 bytes

522
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:40,300
because it's just ID 380 383 three times
10 three bites

523
00:33:40,300 --> 00:33:44,800
well it looks at this first id3 and it
carves out all the rest a bit

524
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:49,130
as an mp3 so 30 by mp3 file becomes the
next 93

525
00:33:49,130 --> 00:33:52,800
carves out all the rest again and got a
27 by mp3 file

526
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:55,810
and on and on and on and on to hit the
last 33

527
00:33:55,810 --> 00:33:58,899
so 30 bytes a magic bomb

528
00:33:58,900 --> 00:34:04,200
is a 165 by bytes total on when it gets
worse and worse and worse is actually

529
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:05,230
exponential

530
00:34:05,230 --> 00:34:08,510
on sup another funny example as a

531
00:34:08,510 --> 00:34:11,700
as far as targeting goes as you got a
scalpel carbon you got

532
00:34:11,700 --> 00:34:15,080
images and movies and you know that's
where type

533
00:34:15,080 --> 00:34:22,080
returning it for a guy that's gonna find
a computer with Mike that so

534
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:26,830
machinist tool on have for this 1i shows
screen shots ahead to do that because

535
00:34:26,830 --> 00:34:28,330
this is a long process when you're

536
00:34:28,330 --> 00:34:34,529
you know filled up the hard drive it
takes a while her but I'll show you a

537
00:34:34,530 --> 00:34:41,530
small-scale example

538
00:34:42,539 --> 00:34:45,429
innocence was the same time it happened
too much same commander

539
00:34:45,429 --> 00:34:52,429
ran at

540
00:34:55,869 --> 00:34:58,000
dash

541
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,090
so we have a 3k file

542
00:35:00,090 --> 00:35:03,320
is with upward with their standards
couple icon

543
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:07,210
so what's runs couple against it

544
00:35:07,210 --> 00:35:10,890
10,000 feet right to expect

545
00:35:10,890 --> 00:35:14,400
it's all garbage that's nothing on and
to show you

546
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:21,400
the output folder 2.3 makes

547
00:35:21,710 --> 00:35:26,430
garbage trash that a small ass small
examples 10 files

548
00:35:26,430 --> 00:35:30,930
I mean what if we did a lot more than
that so

549
00:35:30,930 --> 00:35:36,680
this time all the screenshots just
because quick soaring to a six thousand

550
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:37,850
modifier

551
00:35:37,850 --> 00:35:41,868
6,000 over there finish in 10 seconds
for a quick

552
00:35:41,869 --> 00:35:45,320
in a rundskop against it that's the
command

553
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:49,260
rest couple 6,000 miles Beach

554
00:35:49,260 --> 00:35:52,560
the bottom Iran do you on as well on the
folder

555
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:55,980
on and this is a to make a bite magic
bomb

556
00:35:55,980 --> 00:35:59,619
two megabytes the folder 175 pics

557
00:35:59,619 --> 00:36:04,800
and that's a small sample and that's all
I can really test on this laptop here

558
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:11,560
I mean we can get much better than that
well

559
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:16,619
parka magic bombs or same concept as all
the rest it's a prank but we're gonna

560
00:36:16,619 --> 00:36:23,619
stay alert to

561
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:31,500
so we'll do six thousand this time cuz
I'm nice gonna run scalpel

562
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:36,460
against it it takes a long time again if
people work and you can give your own

563
00:36:36,460 --> 00:36:37,130
custom

564
00:36:37,130 --> 00:36:40,330
a header footer if you don't use a
default in this case I used our

565
00:36:40,330 --> 00:36:44,319
St E for the header and a.g.o for the
first day ago

566
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:48,920
is couple the car goes out with a DD and
I'm using plain text i text again as

567
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:55,920
input fathers day ago

568
00:37:01,940 --> 00:37:07,310
that's done

569
00:37:07,310 --> 00:37:14,310
was lying its but you mix

570
00:37:14,850 --> 00:37:19,110
we're gonna looking to excel put a bit
this time I did just the first 21 lines

571
00:37:19,110 --> 00:37:22,610
tax wise man's head 21 on

572
00:37:22,610 --> 00:37:26,300
you'll see it towards the bottom of this
one as well you'll see that St E

573
00:37:26,300 --> 00:37:29,650
are in capitals around the 4th the last
line and then

574
00:37:29,650 --> 00:37:33,090
right after it a secret message with two
lines a text and then

575
00:37:33,090 --> 00:37:36,540
go Maceo and you can encrypt it to you

576
00:37:36,540 --> 00:37:39,610
so extracted as well

577
00:37:39,610 --> 00:37:44,590
and you gotta tell it

578
00:37:44,590 --> 00:37:47,970
use a password obviously it is the same
password but you also have to tell it

579
00:37:47,970 --> 00:37:49,990
what header and footer was used as well

580
00:37:49,990 --> 00:37:54,270
sells three lines a context there and
we're gonna look at out i DD

581
00:37:54,270 --> 00:38:01,270
and we're gonna put into to curb did i
text

582
00:38:03,410 --> 00:38:10,098
see your message with two hundred ext

583
00:38:10,099 --> 00:38:13,000
I'm almost done here actually called

584
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:16,690
on this one

585
00:38:16,690 --> 00:38:21,020
this is not my tool but when I came
across it I thought I had included

586
00:38:21,020 --> 00:38:24,930
I went to their site and I cannot find
the the real authors are

587
00:38:24,930 --> 00:38:28,950
you can contact with them but are cycle
its pandemic

588
00:38:28,950 --> 00:38:33,380
and its steganography on but it still
another listings at: avoid

589
00:38:33,380 --> 00:38:36,880
so it's something you can email to
somebody and the message

590
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:39,900
looks like spam Mia

591
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:46,050
get

592
00:38:46,050 --> 00:38:53,050
internet connection required here

593
00:38:57,079 --> 00:39:03,100
sure whenever

594
00:39:03,100 --> 00:39:08,299
or not whatever but if I copy and paste
this and you guys can do it later to you

595
00:39:08,300 --> 00:39:12,260
when this is all about it but are you
you copy and paste this into

596
00:39:12,260 --> 00:39:16,119
Hispanic dot com and click decode pasted
and animal decoder

597
00:39:16,119 --> 00:39:19,950
hope number nine on the cool thing is
that the hope

598
00:39:19,950 --> 00:39:26,250
number nine isn't anywhere in the
message skeptical there

599
00:39:26,250 --> 00:39:33,250
now I owe him a share needs to know

600
00:39:39,940 --> 00:39:42,150
no

601
00:39:42,150 --> 00:39:43,340
deco

602
00:39:43,340 --> 00:39:47,410
basis

603
00:39:47,410 --> 00:39:54,410
hope number nine

604
00:39:54,890 --> 00:39:58,140
alright so this is pretty much the
almost than here

605
00:39:58,140 --> 00:40:01,910
I am just gonna say that are the most
fun thing to do is to combine all three

606
00:40:01,910 --> 00:40:02,720
tools

607
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:06,230
to change them one after another inside
each other so say are

608
00:40:06,230 --> 00:40:10,240
investigator and you know about my tools
are so you have this

609
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:14,310
school filesystem all it's like a
graphical representation of a filesystem

610
00:40:14,310 --> 00:40:17,670
near carving files it's our first at the
car files

611
00:40:17,670 --> 00:40:23,130
and you get a magic bomb and the size
after scuffles 530 terabytes

612
00:40:23,130 --> 00:40:26,760
and really that magic mom isn't that big
button

613
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:30,830
it sits in the neck bites but after use
Cup again since 530 terabytes

614
00:40:30,830 --> 00:40:34,110
on so if you know my tools you

615
00:40:34,110 --> 00:40:37,190
use magic promise or to extract
whatever's in there

616
00:40:37,190 --> 00:40:41,700
and what you get is well don't yet see
man that's nineteen megabytes

617
00:40:41,700 --> 00:40:45,610
inspector has a virus well i txt

618
00:40:45,610 --> 00:40:50,340
not actually a virus a looks like a
virus is as far as a buyer since you

619
00:40:50,340 --> 00:40:51,380
guys but it's not a virus

620
00:40:51,380 --> 00:40:54,930
about to end you know my tool from it
all set

621
00:40:54,930 --> 00:40:58,390
are what you want to use as historians
that and if you do

622
00:40:58,390 --> 00:41:01,540
you get a file called pictures does it
nine megabytes

623
00:41:01,540 --> 00:41:04,750
extract all Turner 56 terabytes OJ pics

624
00:41:04,750 --> 00:41:08,280
and there's nothing in foreign any on
cuz

625
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:12,230
as a south pole structure it's in the
file system not the house in it

626
00:41:12,230 --> 00:41:15,440
specter's does it stark up on

627
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:20,300
but you know it alls extract was it now
and as a text file it says the princess

628
00:41:20,300 --> 00:41:21,420
is in another castle

629
00:41:21,420 --> 00:41:25,110
and that's a marker making them work

630
00:41:25,110 --> 00:41:28,670
that that's meaningless it saying look
somewhere else you went through all that

631
00:41:28,670 --> 00:41:29,210
work

632
00:41:29,210 --> 00:41:35,020
you found something now that's the
command

633
00:41:35,020 --> 00:41:38,259
but to generate that so I will

634
00:41:38,260 --> 00:41:43,870
there's a command

635
00:41:43,870 --> 00:41:47,859
I echo the princess is in another castle
to plain text i to

636
00:41:47,860 --> 00:41:52,190
or plain text attacks Angeles CA run
through a chain all the way through

637
00:41:52,190 --> 00:41:59,190
so run it

638
00:42:08,310 --> 00:42:10,120
right

639
00:42:10,120 --> 00:42:15,339
so it's out ideas output see

640
00:42:15,340 --> 00:42:19,490
for 296 terabytes because out I D

641
00:42:19,490 --> 00:42:23,380
it's like 11 makes

642
00:42:23,380 --> 00:42:27,270
much so

643
00:42:27,270 --> 00:42:32,630
I'll near as POS running a compound
command here

644
00:42:32,630 --> 00:42:37,670
when you start deleting some these files
one by one i text you

645
00:42:37,670 --> 00:42:40,910
we don't want that go on they'll keep
land tax whatever

646
00:42:40,910 --> 00:42:44,710
now would leave that to you here's
pictures pictured now

647
00:42:44,710 --> 00:42:48,030
we need to keep bad idea I was a pillar
monster

648
00:42:48,030 --> 00:42:52,190
law scripted aka

649
00:42:52,190 --> 00:42:56,780
just a show

650
00:42:56,780 --> 00:43:00,620
we're starting without ID DD or %uh TD
and we'll get our secure message I do

651
00:43:00,620 --> 00:43:01,210
that with the

652
00:43:01,210 --> 00:43:07,330
are other command says the command to
extract all that

653
00:43:07,330 --> 00:43:10,810
another compound command text Rachael
our that out about the dev

654
00:43:10,810 --> 00:43:15,660
run it we now have

655
00:43:15,660 --> 00:43:22,660
to cryptid to not text Norris

656
00:43:31,320 --> 00:43:32,710
Cicero take questions

657
00:43:32,710 --> 00:43:36,350
up on a look any questions had for this
but but

658
00:43:36,350 --> 00:43:40,779
thanks credit shouts on my friend
medicine storm is that this was present

659
00:43:40,780 --> 00:43:44,650
with me but things came out so but we ve
had the same mindset as me so it's in

660
00:43:44,650 --> 00:43:45,460
the conversations

661
00:43:45,460 --> 00:43:49,150
knack for the crayon art architects 2600

on they're they're great people on and
that's akin

663
00:43:52,770 --> 00:43:56,590
heatsink labs offer letting me use their
space in a soco there and sometimes

664
00:43:56,590 --> 00:43:58,000
print weird 3d stuff

665
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:02,610
pssh surfing Exeter society hackers

the just for all the feedback hey I
kinda whenever some ideas with them

667
00:44:06,740 --> 00:44:10,720
on and make him some good be back on
impressed by Jess it's not are points

668
00:44:10,720 --> 00:44:11,400
what I used

669
00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:14,950
arm and then open clipart for stealing
some other

670
00:44:14,950 --> 00:44:21,950
are them it's a it's not really a
question it's more than anecdotal

671
00:44:22,020 --> 00:44:25,450
i've seen a and unintentional a

672
00:44:25,450 --> 00:44:29,830
situation very someone's similar to some
of these intentional situations that

673
00:44:29,830 --> 00:44:30,830
might find amusing

674
00:44:30,830 --> 00:44:35,660
it was a II a was working with file
sharing service that allows transcoding

675
00:44:35,660 --> 00:44:36,399
on the back end

676
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:42,530
and someone uploaded a 15,000 by 12,000
pixel

677
00:44:42,530 --> 00:44:45,630
a one bit architectural drawing

678
00:44:45,630 --> 00:44:49,170
that was compressed down LZW

679
00:44:49,170 --> 00:44:53,170
thank you for having a compressed and
the like $200k

680
00:44:53,170 --> 00:44:56,730
and are back in transfers are running
image magic which

681
00:44:56,730 --> 00:44:59,800
in order to transcode decompressed it
Iran

682
00:44:59,800 --> 00:45:03,180
there wasn't enough ran for two
decompress it cites whopping

683
00:45:03,180 --> 00:45:06,319
and than that crashed and it was like

684
00:45:06,320 --> 00:45:09,770
and then the chance cutters were like oh
that felt right again so they cut into

685
00:45:09,770 --> 00:45:12,770
this loop where a $200k file took down
our entire

686
00:45:12,770 --> 00:45:18,230
can scan I'm sweet that's when you know
unintended things can happen without

687
00:45:18,230 --> 00:45:19,740
actually I like that cuz

688
00:45:19,740 --> 00:45:24,100
up and more time away don't like that as
well as thinking about other dementia

689
00:45:24,100 --> 00:45:26,900
exporters I was going to do it as a
separate all but I sex you can use that

690
00:45:26,900 --> 00:45:27,510
for the

691
00:45:27,510 --> 00:45:30,600
a the virus one cuz it actually can you

692
00:45:30,600 --> 00:45:33,760
real files like taxis and PS all that I
wanted a

693
00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:37,520
have its prototype for the the image
which had India

694
00:45:37,520 --> 00:45:41,330
but for the image that the something
like that like a a purple

695
00:45:41,330 --> 00:45:44,759
picture you know purple icon anything
but a

696
00:45:44,760 --> 00:45:50,190
yes so I thought I would have been funny
to you

697
00:45:50,190 --> 00:45:53,860
naw

698
00:45:53,860 --> 00:46:00,860
go back and a

699
00:46:01,780 --> 00:46:04,960
should be uploaded in four minutes

700
00:46:04,960 --> 00:46:08,620
for if I know my time zones rain all
that is it

701
00:46:08,620 --> 00:46:12,960
cool part the other questions

702
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:16,270
your

703
00:46:16,270 --> 00:46:17,040
also turned on
