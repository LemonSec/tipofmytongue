1
00:00:00,049 --> 00:00:04,170
would like this I would like to
represent Jason Scott strange and

2
00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:05,060
wonderful the journal

3
00:00:05,060 --> 00:00:12,060
digital history art is a defense got
everyone way so this thing is actually

4
00:00:13,940 --> 00:00:17,900
working on the first try congratulations
sound dude thank you

5
00:00:17,900 --> 00:00:24,449
I've done a lot of talk some believe me

6
00:00:24,449 --> 00:00:28,810
are you start the feel blessed for
anything that works the first time

7
00:00:28,810 --> 00:00:32,850
cell while I can barely see you for all
the things I step out here to get bad

8
00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:37,160
of how many people here have never been
to a Jason Scott talk before

9
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:40,969
so small smattering %uh view jesus what
are you doing Johannes gets better as

10
00:00:40,969 --> 00:00:41,760
the other room

11
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:45,980
alright and how many people have been
could have learned to ask both because

12
00:00:45,980 --> 00:00:48,039
some you people are lazy

13
00:00:48,039 --> 00:00:53,629
lazy hello my name is Jason Scott lives
change paradigm shifted

14
00:00:53,629 --> 00:00:57,649
if you came to this talk that's very
interesting because the description

15
00:00:57,649 --> 00:01:03,340
is terrible that means you're a person
is like 00 surely this is going to be

16
00:01:03,340 --> 00:01:04,150
insane

17
00:01:04,150 --> 00:01:07,780
I think I'll do this and so of course US
the first question is what the fuck is

18
00:01:07,780 --> 00:01:08,590
an Argosy

19
00:01:08,590 --> 00:01:13,920
arm so it's probably not a flotilla
ships ponerlo Sri but it is an opulent

20
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:15,020
supply

21
00:01:15,020 --> 00:01:18,399
gonna jump through a buncha concepts
right now

22
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:21,860
budget things about me but about what
I'm going up to I've been speaking at

23
00:01:21,860 --> 00:01:23,580
hope now for about 10 years

24
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:27,520
I've been having a wonderful time and
i'm glad that somehow the hotel Penn

25
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:31,200
never seems to find a buyer in once
again we get the five-star lobby in the

26
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:32,380
one-star rooms

27
00:01:32,380 --> 00:01:36,548
the

28
00:01:36,549 --> 00:01:41,350
now become a given these talks right
talk about this right use this

29
00:01:41,350 --> 00:01:43,850
particular paradigm of talk there's
always somebody who's like

30
00:01:43,850 --> 00:01:48,229
he seemed really light on the technical
details just get the fuck out now nerd

31
00:01:48,229 --> 00:01:52,240
because because that's not going to
happen a whole lot okay

32
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:56,450
I'm dedicating this talk tonight tonight
stockard the CDC who sadly left us a

33
00:01:56,450 --> 00:01:57,600
couple weeks ago

34
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:00,979
%uh man was hardcore to the end he was a
member the youth international party

35
00:02:00,979 --> 00:02:04,210
line got involved in Tappan followed
2600 up

36
00:02:04,210 --> 00:02:07,920
and became a proud member of the cult
the dead cow

37
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:13,650
and it will be to settle drink in his
name at this lil while ago sold by Chris

38
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:16,730
a lot of this talk is kind of in the
same

39
00:02:16,730 --> 00:02:20,480
area as predictors inventing on
principle which is a talk that just came

40
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:21,488
out this year

41
00:02:21,489 --> 00:02:26,080
which I really recommend you look at in
it he's basically talking about shifting

42
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:27,209
one's life

43
00:02:27,209 --> 00:02:30,550
towards priorities he then gives so
incredible tech demos

44
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:34,459
to completely confuse and confound the
audience that there's some cool tech

45
00:02:34,459 --> 00:02:37,879
then goes right back to say actually
it's much bigger than all this is much

46
00:02:37,879 --> 00:02:38,819
bigger

47
00:02:38,819 --> 00:02:42,260
these cute tech demos I am creating
things according to a purpose

48
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:45,440
not because a passion not because I'm
trying to

49
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:50,420
change %uh the world outlook into
something that will make me rich

50
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:53,800
but just let's do something so but
Victor cuz if you listen to this and

51
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:55,200
you've heard that talk you're gonna go

52
00:02:55,200 --> 00:03:01,510
like that I wanna say call text files
dot com

53
00:03:01,510 --> 00:03:08,220
I've been running the site now for about
14 years the newbies in the audience

54
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:09,030
rather oh my god

55
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:12,519
that guy or what the fuck is text files
dot com

56
00:03:12,519 --> 00:03:17,470
text all the calm is a site dedicated to
bulletin board systems which was

57
00:03:17,470 --> 00:03:21,769
this thing it was a computer with a fat
guy behind it that would use a foam

58
00:03:21,769 --> 00:03:26,590
to connect to another computer with a
fat guy behind it it was very popular I

59
00:03:26,590 --> 00:03:28,140
promise you was really kinda cool

60
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:32,209
and are monitoring the site now for
about 14 years like I said

61
00:03:32,209 --> 00:03:35,620
since I was 28 941 now and I

62
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:39,299
a did it because at the time I was
worried

63
00:03:39,299 --> 00:03:42,959
I was we were going to have this history
that I had gained as a child

64
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:46,390
and that it was going to disappear so I
was I was

65
00:03:46,390 --> 00:03:50,019
I was worried and so I put it as much a
bit up as I could it became a honey pot

66
00:03:50,019 --> 00:03:51,560
for other people to give it to me

67
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:55,010
and from that the rest of my projects
have all come from the text files that

68
00:03:55,010 --> 00:03:55,560
com

69
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:58,830
my dress is Jason the text files that
com I want your old shit

70
00:03:58,830 --> 00:04:03,450
I've been speaking like I said it hoped
with Willie kinda unusual costumes

71
00:04:03,450 --> 00:04:07,349
for whatever reason this one seems to be
the one that everybody uses with me

72
00:04:07,349 --> 00:04:10,580
was just when I decided to be ironically
steampunk

73
00:04:10,580 --> 00:04:13,780
don't be ironically anything as it turns
out you

74
00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:18,418
are that thing as far as people are
concerned I'm really happy with a go

75
00:04:18,418 --> 00:04:19,339
around with this all day

76
00:04:19,340 --> 00:04:22,530
so anyway

77
00:04:22,530 --> 00:04:26,270
and of course like I said if your gonna
speak about anything speak about it

78
00:04:26,270 --> 00:04:29,430
with a kangaroo hide hat because that

79
00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:32,660
says I know history

80
00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:36,130
so beginnings as me and Dad arm

81
00:04:36,130 --> 00:04:40,430
so I was born in 1970 which means that
I'm just passed up the mainframe you're

82
00:04:40,430 --> 00:04:40,840
a

83
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:44,060
and beginning the Europe the micro by
the time I'm

84
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:48,669
relatively card the center of the earth
and my father worked for IBM he like to

85
00:04:48,669 --> 00:04:49,669
take me into

86
00:04:49,669 --> 00:04:54,099
look at things and so I got exposed
computers at a very early age

87
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:57,360
and I like them here's need eleven
hosing

88
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:02,039
as one might pose with the celebrity
next to the Apple cube

89
00:05:02,039 --> 00:05:06,210
in Cupertino like I said I was about 11
or 12 you and I made my father stopped

90
00:05:06,210 --> 00:05:08,099
the car so I could

91
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:11,410
polls in my aviator glasses next to the

92
00:05:11,410 --> 00:05:16,060
Apple cube so I had a warm loving
history with this

93
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:19,789
and so so here's the thing

94
00:05:19,789 --> 00:05:24,389
right so a lot of people have been like
what your bro did this all come from and

95
00:05:24,389 --> 00:05:25,970
as far as I can determine

96
00:05:25,970 --> 00:05:29,310
it came from the night that my mother a

97
00:05:29,310 --> 00:05:32,490
came to me at least two in the morning
and explained we had to leave the house

98
00:05:32,490 --> 00:05:34,789
right now because she was leaving my
father

99
00:05:34,789 --> 00:05:38,669
to grab what was useful and to leave

100
00:05:38,669 --> 00:05:43,508
it turns out with useful 28 year old is
a dog in a blanket

101
00:05:43,509 --> 00:05:48,350
but it meant that at a very early age I
learned a very important lesson

102
00:05:48,350 --> 00:05:51,800
which is nothing is permanent need
everything is transient

103
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:55,199
everything you depend on could be gone
tomorrow so either enjoy it

104
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:59,250
or keep a lot of it because it's going
to disappear

105
00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:02,560
not every kid gets this lesson until
later in life but I got it very

106
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:06,919
early so when I was on computer bulletin
board systems I would go on to these

107
00:06:06,919 --> 00:06:11,099
are places and then download as much of
the data as I could because as it turns

108
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:11,940
out

109
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:17,039
a lot of it was illegal and they were
deleted very soon afterward

110
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:20,490
is pros and cons we want the best source
is a bombs information on the internet

111
00:06:20,490 --> 00:06:22,110
but

112
00:06:22,110 --> 00:06:25,800
one thing I have on there is all these
one-time computer bulletin boards these

113
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:27,030
moments in time these

114
00:06:27,030 --> 00:06:30,660
online butterflies the just disappearing
die

115
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:35,050
and I picked them up because I was
afraid that they be gone

116
00:06:35,050 --> 00:06:39,400
so people silly what's your success in
my successes early tragedy

117
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:43,780
equal success soap so it just feel
sometimes people try to pick up with

118
00:06:43,780 --> 00:06:45,860
what's wrong with it with a market there
you go

119
00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:49,270
could be gone

120
00:06:49,270 --> 00:06:52,539
so in my room believe it or not I have

121
00:06:52,539 --> 00:06:55,580
this which is why original computer
every year and on

122
00:06:55,580 --> 00:06:58,669
a Commodore PET which is %uh

123
00:06:58,669 --> 00:07:02,190
8k um Arkansas set based

124
00:07:02,190 --> 00:07:05,940
machine that I have kept with me all of
my life

125
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:10,550
because I did not I got it I got to keep
it and I know medical way now

126
00:07:10,550 --> 00:07:13,729
for a moment there some love you like
yeah that's nice but what the fuck is up

127
00:07:13,729 --> 00:07:16,280
with that room

128
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:19,949
so this is my room on this is why spend
a lot of my days

129
00:07:19,949 --> 00:07:23,030
again I'm 41 n so

130
00:07:23,030 --> 00:07:26,110
over in the back they are you know this
is the %uh computer

131
00:07:26,110 --> 00:07:30,630
ingestion section this is media over
here is the main terminal for the input

132
00:07:30,630 --> 00:07:34,060
on left here we won't talk about that on
the right over here

133
00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:39,270
this is the living space this is the
filming space overhears a worktable

134
00:07:39,270 --> 00:07:45,710
so wow that's a lot to stop chasing you
should find a place for it

135
00:07:45,710 --> 00:07:50,819
I found a place for it so there's my
brother

136
00:07:50,819 --> 00:07:54,650
elderly nonplussed that I'm about to put
this on his property

137
00:07:54,650 --> 00:07:58,440
sold

138
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:02,469
you need a place storage shipping
containers

139
00:08:02,470 --> 00:08:05,410
New York has to be legal to marry them
but when they do I'm gonna marry this

140
00:08:05,410 --> 00:08:06,940
one because this thing

141
00:08:06,940 --> 00:08:10,750
is awesome this thing is awesome it's
forty feet by 8

142
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:14,930
by a it still has Chinese markings from
that used to sell clothes inside a bit

143
00:08:14,930 --> 00:08:19,470
and I love it inside a bit I've been
putting lots more crap

144
00:08:19,470 --> 00:08:25,520
this is a lie this is still a first look
at it looks more like this

145
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:28,819
this one's for my parents this one's
what it's like

146
00:08:28,819 --> 00:08:34,630
anyway so and in this being I have been
putting tons and tons of computer

147
00:08:34,630 --> 00:08:37,649
equipment arm software

148
00:08:37,649 --> 00:08:40,779
a pieces of paper that I thought were
important

149
00:08:40,779 --> 00:08:44,019
are things I have been here include arm
an entire collection

150
00:08:44,019 --> 00:08:47,459

151
00:08:47,459 --> 00:08:50,600
almost every up computer proceedings

152
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:53,870
document and just tons and tons and tons

153
00:08:53,870 --> 00:08:57,080
love CDs and magazines

154
00:08:57,080 --> 00:09:01,110
so here's some being done I just for
some up you can know but this part in my

155
00:09:01,110 --> 00:09:04,760
life that is the most famous cat on the
internet on Twitter

156
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:08,220
ok

157
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:11,760
really this is really just like to see
what the fuck the sucking 2 guys up to

158
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:15,050
alright well take it would accomplish
socking 10 if you're like wow a cat is a

159
00:09:15,050 --> 00:09:16,700
million followers on Twitter

160
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:19,959
yeah gray anyway so

161
00:09:19,959 --> 00:09:23,930
I love the CDs I think CDs are the most
important thing in the world

162
00:09:23,930 --> 00:09:28,070
in terms of that period of time because
at a time when it was so expensive to

163
00:09:28,070 --> 00:09:28,870
buy a 10

164
00:09:28,870 --> 00:09:33,300
megabyte hard drive the 640 megabyte
pieces a plastic

165
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:37,070
insured a that once you get the hang up
the manufacturer they were cheap you

166
00:09:37,070 --> 00:09:39,779
could sell them for many many more times
their value

167
00:09:39,779 --> 00:09:43,149
and be there and other shit tooth back
on 'em

168
00:09:43,149 --> 00:09:46,860
this means that they had to go to
Baltimore systems to all mine sites to

169
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:47,600
Usenet

170
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:51,459
to anything they could find to sell any
product that they could find

171
00:09:51,459 --> 00:09:55,130
and so they became unwillingly
anthropologists

172
00:09:55,130 --> 00:09:59,040
abyss history I love them so much people
send them to me

173
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:03,089
all the time so this is the stuff that I
am constantly getting here's a whole

174
00:10:03,089 --> 00:10:04,190
bunch a PC gamer

175
00:10:04,190 --> 00:10:07,430
cover discs you like that's really
extreme but the first we'll love

176
00:10:07,430 --> 00:10:08,300
collecting

177
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:12,899
is for every time you think your extreme
is always somebody more extreme than you

178
00:10:12,899 --> 00:10:15,980
what I love about this particular one is
the left side is the

179
00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:19,910
in pile and the right side is the ALP
I'll

180
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:23,610
thanks buddy all these people were
sending me in these disk images

181
00:10:23,610 --> 00:10:26,620
we've been able to find like real
treasures in there

182
00:10:26,620 --> 00:10:30,589
I happen to believe that it doesn't it
the hardest part about history

183
00:10:30,589 --> 00:10:34,180
is collecting it when it happens that's
the easy you know that's the part that's

184
00:10:34,180 --> 00:10:34,510
just

185
00:10:34,510 --> 00:10:37,610
really crazy and soul when you have all
the stuff

186
00:10:37,610 --> 00:10:41,560
available that's when we can start to
really like learn from them

187
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:44,800
so I am a big fan of not asking people
to sort

188
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:48,180
people say I want to suggest that but i
wanna go through it now but no no no

189
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:54,200
send it here the robot overlords will
deal with it in just a few years

190
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:58,610
this is again lent our juniors
collection this is the canoe foundation

191
00:10:58,610 --> 00:11:02,070
a circa 1984 and I got it

192
00:11:02,070 --> 00:11:05,120
so it turns out that it all fit into one
truck

193
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:10,290
but the thing is is that all men said
was I want to clear up my barn

194
00:11:10,290 --> 00:11:13,810
and people were like you know he said I
have some bite magazines and people were

195
00:11:13,810 --> 00:11:14,990
asking him for

196
00:11:14,990 --> 00:11:18,120
this issued by because it was very
valuable

197
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:21,339
and could I have this piece of equipment
at its valuable and I was the only one

198
00:11:21,339 --> 00:11:21,899
who said

199
00:11:21,899 --> 00:11:25,519
I'll be by with the truck tonight

200
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:32,500
so i won that's how that works alright

201
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:36,860
we are still prepared to peace scrap out
from the vine right there instead to

202
00:11:36,860 --> 00:11:37,519
saying

203
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:41,360
I'll deal with it your hair cell

204
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:45,790
what the hell is this Jason this is a
box I've never opened

205
00:11:45,790 --> 00:11:49,149
that I am shipping away they shipped the
way that date

206
00:11:49,149 --> 00:11:54,430
this is the world's largest Saved by the
Bell collection

207
00:11:54,430 --> 00:11:57,779
I'm I was going to write a story on this
and never got around to it now you're

208
00:11:57,779 --> 00:11:58,720
hearing about it now

209
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:01,740
basically on e-bay somebody offered the
world's largest

210
00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:05,130
Saved by the Bell collection the
comprehensive collection

211
00:12:05,130 --> 00:12:08,370
all aspects I've saved by the Bell

212
00:12:08,370 --> 00:12:11,810
everything we're talking about all love
the the show's

213
00:12:11,810 --> 00:12:16,240
a fan magazines stickers posters
anything associated with it

214
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:20,610
and I bought it didn't and I was tested
that now I was the owner of the world's

215
00:12:20,610 --> 00:12:23,060
largest Saved by the Bell collection

216
00:12:23,060 --> 00:12:28,250
I held my crown firmly as I never open
this box and kept it for five years

217
00:12:28,250 --> 00:12:31,800
finally on on a cruise for the singer
Jonathan Colton and

218
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:35,240
I'm talking to somebody I mention as an
aside the someone yeah I happen to have

219
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:37,750
the world's largest Saved by the Bell
collection

220
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:41,740
are getting laid that night and

221
00:12:41,740 --> 00:12:45,779
a guy next to me said I could use that
and I said why and it turned out he had

222
00:12:45,779 --> 00:12:47,450
11 largest

223
00:12:47,450 --> 00:12:50,670
Saved by the Bell sites

224
00:12:50,670 --> 00:12:56,800
so a deal was struck I would give it to
him and he would never give it back

225
00:12:56,800 --> 00:13:01,529
and all of it went to the mail so I've
never looked in that box

226
00:13:01,529 --> 00:13:05,920
I hope you had a wonderful time we've
never talked again

227
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:09,560
that's called saving history

228
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:13,810
this is also something very interesting
these are the all the legal papers at

229
00:13:13,810 --> 00:13:14,220
the

230
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:18,180
BFF's 2600 case

231
00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:22,380
when Emanuel found out that the effect
was going to throw it out because it had

232
00:13:22,380 --> 00:13:24,000
been 10 years

233
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:28,209
he came to me your and I took them

234
00:13:28,209 --> 00:13:32,860
um I didn't have a place for them
because they came randomly it turned out

235
00:13:32,860 --> 00:13:36,839
just due to an oversight what I thought
when I thought they meant

236
00:13:36,839 --> 00:13:40,209
do you want them yes and they send it to
you

237
00:13:40,209 --> 00:13:43,970
with the really meant was do you want it

238
00:13:43,970 --> 00:13:48,279
yes grady when we lose the lease on that
should be

239
00:13:48,279 --> 00:13:51,680
container you will get that peace

240
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:55,990
that pete that happened four months
later in the dead of winter

241
00:13:55,990 --> 00:14:00,310
as I was about to leave for New York
City from my upstate home

242
00:14:00,310 --> 00:14:03,459
so I threw them under this plastic bag
lead stuff to do

243
00:14:03,459 --> 00:14:07,329
and I took this sad pathetic picture and
said I needed help storing it

244
00:14:07,329 --> 00:14:10,990
and shook on step forward social
concretely has our plans to digitize all

245
00:14:10,990 --> 00:14:12,600
that put online

246
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:16,690
it's actually a fascinating insight into
what the world thinks hackers are this

247
00:14:16,690 --> 00:14:19,079
is of course the DEC SS case

248
00:14:19,079 --> 00:14:22,680
where they were browsing the

249
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:25,920
%uh the DVD hacking IRC channels

250
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:30,540
for months on end so we have lots of all
that we have testimony from John Young

251
00:14:30,540 --> 00:14:34,170
we have testimony from manual we have
testimony from a whole range of people

252
00:14:34,170 --> 00:14:38,449
all saved so it's just a case of saying
sure I'll take it and then regretting it

253
00:14:38,449 --> 00:14:39,630
forever

254
00:14:39,630 --> 00:14:43,779
but also it's amazing how many people
will step forward to take stuff if you

255
00:14:43,779 --> 00:14:45,959
put it pathetically outside in the snow

256
00:14:45,959 --> 00:14:51,380
on good healthy people on e-bay

257
00:14:51,380 --> 00:14:54,740
but you know having the stop is one
thing but then I think the real next

258
00:14:54,740 --> 00:14:58,079
move is to put it online but not to
destroy the original

259
00:14:58,079 --> 00:15:01,560
that's a big fight I have with people I
see people who'll will basically rip all

260
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:04,790
the pages of a magazine scan it and then
through the pages away

261
00:15:04,790 --> 00:15:07,800
I'm not a big fan of that but I am a big
fan of putting an online

262
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:10,910
I put lots and lots of stuff online and
text files to come

263
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:14,339
text files that comet started was text
files but now it's got everything from

264
00:15:14,339 --> 00:15:15,660
PDF files

265
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:21,180
to 'em music and sound and CDs

266
00:15:21,180 --> 00:15:24,930
so for the CD collection you can see if
you

267
00:15:24,930 --> 00:15:29,420
your six inches from this friggin screen
that it there are three million files on

268
00:15:29,420 --> 00:15:30,170
there

269
00:15:30,170 --> 00:15:33,990
three million shareware files that I
split apart made available

270
00:15:33,990 --> 00:15:37,209
the not ISO is because I just don't have
the space but you can go through all the

271
00:15:37,209 --> 00:15:38,190
filesystems

272
00:15:38,190 --> 00:15:41,910
go look at all what's on there be able
to see all descriptions of these amazing

273
00:15:41,910 --> 00:15:47,329
amazing images and at this point it's
300 gig but it's actually a lot more now

274
00:15:47,329 --> 00:15:51,300
you also get amazing things in the mail
this is a fascinating that I got from

275
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:54,850
a law firm about my erotic stories
section in which

276
00:15:54,850 --> 00:15:57,990
I gave a talk about this the arm

277
00:15:57,990 --> 00:16:01,339
the sex stories talk about something
called Bartek small bar taxes that you

278
00:16:01,339 --> 00:16:02,959
re through a catheter

279
00:16:02,959 --> 00:16:06,420
alright but a whole bunch erotica

280
00:16:06,420 --> 00:16:09,959
uses it as a as a arm synonym for enema

281
00:16:09,959 --> 00:16:13,269
I don't know why but they do knows a
thing called the Lanham Act

282
00:16:13,269 --> 00:16:17,410
which if you're part of 2600 swirled you
know law and the secret law

283
00:16:17,410 --> 00:16:20,639
the Lanham Act allows you to not
diminish somebody else's trademark by

284
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:21,970
misusing it

285
00:16:21,970 --> 00:16:25,339
soul for instance if you make a bomb in
college you know a coca-cola bottler

286
00:16:25,339 --> 00:16:28,259
coca-cola can say that's diminishing are
trademarks we didn't mean to kill people

287
00:16:28,259 --> 00:16:29,180
with a coca-cola

288
00:16:29,180 --> 00:16:33,750
that quickly

289
00:16:33,750 --> 00:16:36,829
said well I level up this thing is is
this one line right here which is you

290
00:16:36,829 --> 00:16:40,529
serve our clients trademark to identify
'em equipment in erotic fiction is

291
00:16:40,529 --> 00:16:42,060
likely to cause confusion

292
00:16:42,060 --> 00:16:47,180
and dilute the value of the bar text
trademark in violation of trademark laws

293
00:16:47,180 --> 00:16:51,209
are courting accordingly we request you
revise the text the stories refer to

294
00:16:51,209 --> 00:16:55,500
enema nozzle animal balloon anima bold
or some other generic term

295
00:16:55,500 --> 00:17:01,550
and discontinue use the bar text
trademark I did not do that

296
00:17:01,550 --> 00:17:05,000
I did take them down I did put up their
letter because of course there PDF

297
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:12,000
letter includes all the stories inside a
bit so

298
00:17:14,919 --> 00:17:17,929
he told you people make me and say like
take this down

299
00:17:17,929 --> 00:17:22,309
I don't delete it sorry UN

300
00:17:22,309 --> 00:17:25,709
and so you know when you have to some
other stuff you end up to

301
00:17:25,709 --> 00:17:29,480
with a whole bunch of weird stories
weird things going on you end up with

302
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:31,789
just crashing into the reality

303
00:17:31,789 --> 00:17:34,809
up the history verses done now and

304
00:17:34,809 --> 00:17:38,428
I'm quite fine being on this crux but it
does sometimes confuse people I have

305
00:17:38,429 --> 00:17:40,059
people who send me things

306
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:43,539
about you know he is something I did 20
years ago when I regret it

307
00:17:43,539 --> 00:17:46,669
and I happen to believe in the infinite
blotter that you wrote it you wanted to

308
00:17:46,669 --> 00:17:47,570
go everywhere

309
00:17:47,570 --> 00:17:51,030
you got your wish yet got your wish

310
00:17:51,030 --> 00:17:54,860
everyone now knows what you like in 8th
grade if you're still young in the

311
00:17:54,860 --> 00:17:56,679
audience you just learned a lesson

312
00:17:56,679 --> 00:18:00,240
you're gonna do much better than your
other peers it's all gonna come out

313
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:04,030
so sorry about that but it is and it not
to be me it's gonna be somebody younger

314
00:18:04,030 --> 00:18:04,830
than me

315
00:18:04,830 --> 00:18:08,559
who's just born now whose parents got
divorced who saving an awful lot a

316
00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:10,389
website

317
00:18:10,390 --> 00:18:14,410
but this is not enough for me okay
putting things on line in storing up but

318
00:18:14,410 --> 00:18:18,330
to craft the people known to me is not
enough so I been changing my life

319
00:18:18,330 --> 00:18:21,620
in other ways for the past 10 years her

320
00:18:21,620 --> 00:18:25,280
so I started a group called archive team

321
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:29,090
archive team is a big activist
preservationist

322
00:18:29,090 --> 00:18:32,350
organization act archive team .org

323
00:18:32,350 --> 00:18:36,990
we are dedicated to the idea that right
now we are in this terrible situation

324
00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:40,910
we recognize a terrible situation right
now user data is not considered

325
00:18:40,910 --> 00:18:44,880
important is considered an unfortunate
byproduct

326
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:48,720
a business and so its deleted

327
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:54,530
as one might delete and unexpected log
file on the NW developer tag

328
00:18:54,530 --> 00:18:58,580
it's not something that you consider
important the people have been duped for

329
00:18:58,580 --> 00:18:59,699
the last twenty yeah I

330
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:03,090
twenty years plus to put their lives
online

331
00:19:03,090 --> 00:19:06,539
to upload their photos to tell their
stories to share their meaning

332
00:19:06,539 --> 00:19:09,669
and put it all on line and you know we
can sit here is people who are

333
00:19:09,669 --> 00:19:12,120
technically astute and say well they
shouldn't do that

334
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:15,370
that's awesome that's like walking by a
car accident going I would wear my

335
00:19:15,370 --> 00:19:16,280
seatbelt

336
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:20,510
up okay it does nothing I hate that
attitude

337
00:19:20,510 --> 00:19:23,950
instead we try to do something about it
so as an activist group

338
00:19:23,950 --> 00:19:27,840
we will try to educate people we let
them go with know what's going on

339
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:30,899
and when we see a site announced its
going down in 30 days

340
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:35,990
14 days or nine detainees and they're
giving you poor export tools or no

341
00:19:35,990 --> 00:19:38,350
export tools basically asking you to
enjoy it

342
00:19:38,350 --> 00:19:42,480
we step in years old but decides to go
down

343
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:46,380
cock had no because my cock a Yahoo
Video went down splendor the Italian geo

344
00:19:46,380 --> 00:19:47,410
cities went down

345
00:19:47,410 --> 00:19:50,770
thanks for trying kick-start which is a
ya who think all the sites

346
00:19:50,770 --> 00:19:54,450
are now gone model me for instance

347
00:19:54,450 --> 00:19:58,260
just shut down now they will tell you
that they've gone to I work and I cloud

348
00:19:58,260 --> 00:19:58,980
but in fact

349
00:19:58,980 --> 00:20:02,030
all the web sites are gone all the
website

350
00:20:02,030 --> 00:20:05,720
our goal on how big is that

351
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:09,870
turns out it's very big because we
downloaded ok

352
00:20:09,870 --> 00:20:13,789
week we

353
00:20:13,789 --> 00:20:17,020
we have something we call the universal
tracker some you might think about it

354
00:20:17,020 --> 00:20:18,490
archive at home

355
00:20:18,490 --> 00:20:22,240
using his a virtual machine called the
archive team warrior that you can run in

356
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:23,919
Linux Mac OS and Windows

357
00:20:23,919 --> 00:20:27,549
you connect to it and you get on a
leaderboard and then our central tracker

358
00:20:27,549 --> 00:20:30,330
tells you which user account to download
to get a copy of them

359
00:20:30,330 --> 00:20:34,110
and he keeps going if you look at this
closely and you don't have to

360
00:20:34,110 --> 00:20:37,400
arm what it will tell you right there

361
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:41,530
is that at this point we have downloaded
232 terabytes

362
00:20:41,530 --> 00:20:45,270
arm at an average of 698

363
00:20:45,270 --> 00:20:48,879
megabytes a second now

364
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:53,510
that's a question accurate actually the
735 make the second it was a 278

365
00:20:53,510 --> 00:20:56,530
terabytes by the time we were done

366
00:20:56,530 --> 00:20:59,870
army that's a lot

367
00:20:59,870 --> 00:21:03,320
all space and people can go

368
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:06,770
she's that'll have to waste a speech on
above the waist a space in

369
00:21:06,770 --> 00:21:07,970
congratulations

370
00:21:07,970 --> 00:21:11,490
your the newest generation a fucker
going 600 megs who wants to keep this

371
00:21:11,490 --> 00:21:13,809
big bowl ground

372
00:21:13,809 --> 00:21:18,649
cake is another ten years to in 78
terabyte is gonna be wit you trade

373
00:21:18,650 --> 00:21:22,740
because you can't be impressive the
somebody ball right now it's huge it's

374
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:24,780
untenable so we grabbed a copy

375
00:21:24,780 --> 00:21:27,830
we would have a graph letting you
quickly go see how we're doing

376
00:21:27,830 --> 00:21:32,408
as you can see we start to get more and
more people adhering to this as we go on

377
00:21:32,409 --> 00:21:36,620
and you can see you to people are real
heroes

378
00:21:36,620 --> 00:21:39,640
it plateaus because at that point we via

379
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:43,580
gotten them now we're doing quality
check but this cash

380
00:21:43,580 --> 00:21:48,960
this guy Kenneth he decided I'm gonna
open up a hundred machines and Roku

381
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:51,890
turned out he won the leaderboard if you
get people leaderboard they will do

382
00:21:51,890 --> 00:21:54,280
stupid shit all day

383
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:57,309
all day long

384
00:21:57,309 --> 00:21:59,980
archive team is moving up to
achievements next week governor is

385
00:21:59,980 --> 00:22:02,820
working on it

386
00:22:02,820 --> 00:22:06,450
for instance tableau okay this is how
we're working in the modern era que

387
00:22:06,450 --> 00:22:10,260
and again this is all extension of my
original concern

388
00:22:10,260 --> 00:22:13,908
a wonder save my blanket my dog we want
to be able to say

389
00:22:13,909 --> 00:22:18,390
stop people from losing what they do not
have low is a photo sharing site

390
00:22:18,390 --> 00:22:23,260
owned by HP hP also on Snapfish for the
peace sickly

391
00:22:23,260 --> 00:22:26,549
through Snapfish in tableau into a room
with a broken pool cue

392
00:22:26,549 --> 00:22:30,150
and Snapfish emerge bluntly so

393
00:22:30,150 --> 00:22:33,770
tableau was given basically about 30
days we're going to get outta town this

394
00:22:33,770 --> 00:22:38,120
is all that remains a tablet Apple had
three hundred thousand users with photos

395
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:42,480
primarily I might say women with
pictures are the kids

396
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:46,880
see can imagine their delight in finding
out that all this stuff was going down

397
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:52,580
often after was down because they did a
really poor job this time

398
00:22:52,580 --> 00:22:56,580
so we grabbed all a bit we grabbed all a
bit in 36 hours

399
00:22:56,580 --> 00:23:00,928
because of our system so we put it back
up again and then

400
00:23:00,929 --> 00:23:04,390
we put up a search engine that instantly
got you back your old photos

401
00:23:04,390 --> 00:23:07,980
I'm not going to make your eyes well up
with the letters we get from others

402
00:23:07,980 --> 00:23:11,000
but wait what about people

403
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:14,510
so this is John sheats John sheats
Isabella engineer

404
00:23:14,510 --> 00:23:19,158
who interviewed back in 2003 I'm related
to a documentary which is why there's

405
00:23:19,159 --> 00:23:21,010
that big lens in his face

406
00:23:21,010 --> 00:23:25,049
and John she'd said why would you wanna
talk to me this is the number one thing

407
00:23:25,049 --> 00:23:27,299
I get I i've done hundreds of interviews

408
00:23:27,299 --> 00:23:31,080
but will it be the question is why would
you want to talk to me he could not

409
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:35,000
believe that I driven from Boston to
Edison New Jersey the interview him

410
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,809
why did I come to interview in this
particular case it was because he had

411
00:23:37,809 --> 00:23:38,850
the largest collection

412
00:23:38,850 --> 00:23:43,480
a remote teletype art and he had all
these things because he was the coal

413
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:43,980
runner

414
00:23:43,980 --> 00:23:47,429
above the really art contest where
people connect to remote teletype via

415
00:23:47,429 --> 00:23:48,299
ham radio

416
00:23:48,299 --> 00:23:52,418
and send each other images on Sunday and
they had a contest over who could draw

417
00:23:52,419 --> 00:23:53,610
the best things

418
00:23:53,610 --> 00:23:56,640
in here all these wonderful images now
I'm not going again

419
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:59,610
no time to show you all these images
each one of the things and tony was a

420
00:23:59,610 --> 00:24:00,320
thread

421
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:03,549
that maybe you can go back and look on
yourself after this talk

422
00:24:03,549 --> 00:24:06,990
to learn about all these things going on
but I do love this one

423
00:24:06,990 --> 00:24:12,490
this one is a 1932 type later are
converted by a telegraph operator TUI

424
00:24:12,490 --> 00:24:13,520
Telegraph tape

425
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:18,360
then converted buyer ready art guy who
then made into a text file

426
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:22,840
which I still have so this one took a
bit of time to get to this point but the

427
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:23,620
point is it was this

428
00:24:23,620 --> 00:24:29,380
unbroken chain the people they can it
looks pretty friggin awesome

429
00:24:29,380 --> 00:24:33,260
I love things in history here I am
posing with no cause pendulum

430
00:24:33,260 --> 00:24:36,580
why not here's me in the caves

431
00:24:36,580 --> 00:24:39,629
that adventure were originally based on
bed quilt

432
00:24:39,630 --> 00:24:42,770
shooting a documentary and shooting

433
00:24:42,770 --> 00:24:48,900
Asia a model actual came about a model
caber to go through the actual locations

434
00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:52,179
so this is wanna this is the bird a
chamber

435
00:24:52,179 --> 00:24:56,950
if you've ever played adventure I'd made
two documentaries one call BBS the

436
00:24:56,950 --> 00:24:57,700
documentary

437
00:24:57,700 --> 00:25:02,039
imagine that another one is called get
lamp: which is about text adventures

438
00:25:02,039 --> 00:25:04,950
not gonna sell them to you right now I'm
just gonna tell you that I made them

439
00:25:04,950 --> 00:25:08,220
because I believe very strongly that
these were human stories

440
00:25:08,220 --> 00:25:11,340
then we have the artifacts which I've
been collecting all my life

441
00:25:11,340 --> 00:25:14,590
that is awesome but another part that's
just the bones

442
00:25:14,590 --> 00:25:18,220
because the pilot bones you have no idea
if that pilot bones loved elicits

443
00:25:18,220 --> 00:25:19,690
actually gendered another skelton

444
00:25:19,690 --> 00:25:23,010
or how that

445
00:25:23,010 --> 00:25:26,320
how that bones holes bones got to where
they are where they had been what they

446
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:27,590
mean and everything else

447
00:25:27,590 --> 00:25:31,490
the sinew the metal that's all these
human stories that I record

448
00:25:31,490 --> 00:25:35,520
very important to me I encourage you if
you are somebody who collects history to

449
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:36,710
spend as much time

450
00:25:36,710 --> 00:25:40,370
using all these wonderful technologies
such as Skype podcasting

451
00:25:40,370 --> 00:25:43,909
milling somebody AR recorder to be able
to get the final

452
00:25:43,909 --> 00:25:48,100
stories that come with the things you're
collecting

453
00:25:48,100 --> 00:25:52,190
at the La to travel these are hotel keys

454
00:25:52,190 --> 00:25:55,059
to tell the stories I've been all over
the world to collect the stories I'm

455
00:25:55,059 --> 00:25:57,389
working on more now because I think that

456
00:25:57,390 --> 00:26:00,750
even though it's a big pain in the ass
to always be on the road there's so many

457
00:26:00,750 --> 00:26:02,090
stories to tell

458
00:26:02,090 --> 00:26:05,610
for the PBS documentary interview 205
people

459
00:26:05,610 --> 00:26:08,809
for the get my amp I don't miss it it's
about something as little as text

460
00:26:08,809 --> 00:26:09,399
adventures

461
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:12,559
and we did eighty but the thing is is
that

462
00:26:12,559 --> 00:26:16,600
all these people produced hour-long
interviews with me that I have

463
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:17,600
considered

464
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:20,850
arm edited turned into movies and put up

465
00:26:20,850 --> 00:26:24,000
because I learned overtime that that's
what

466
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:27,059
I wanted to do

467
00:26:27,059 --> 00:26:30,730
on the left is Jordan neck you're on the
right is Tony DS this is in jordan

468
00:26:30,730 --> 00:26:31,669
actors home

469
00:26:31,669 --> 00:26:35,539
Jordan magner is the creator Prince of
Persia arm

470
00:26:35,539 --> 00:26:39,129
I was involved in a project where Jordan
make your head arm

471
00:26:39,130 --> 00:26:42,929
got not a box from his dad have some old
computer parts inside the computer parts

472
00:26:42,929 --> 00:26:44,090
were his original

473
00:26:44,090 --> 00:26:48,350
source code the Prince of Persia and he
thought

474
00:26:48,350 --> 00:26:51,669
game I'd love to get that upper
something and people said and this is a

475
00:26:51,669 --> 00:26:52,429
nice benefit

476
00:26:52,429 --> 00:26:55,720
having with this life you should talk to
Jason Scott

477
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:59,830
knows it earned her Jordan McMillan I
went to the same high school

478
00:26:59,830 --> 00:27:03,658
arm pure pure coincidence we didn't go I
do his brother very well but I didn't

479
00:27:03,659 --> 00:27:05,130
know him his brother is the model

480
00:27:05,130 --> 00:27:08,870
love the person in print the persian by
the way the film around our high school

481
00:27:08,870 --> 00:27:13,840
and then transferred it into data but it
was now sitting on this bizarre little

482
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:18,500
three and a half inch floppy disc for me
she no longer had

483
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:22,659
in a format he never had but I knew
about Tony DS that the guy on the left

484
00:27:22,659 --> 00:27:23,510
there on the

485
00:27:23,510 --> 00:27:26,770
on the right there for you arm he is an

486
00:27:26,770 --> 00:27:32,080
Apple to expert three words again
guaranteed usually but

487
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:35,939
also really something amazing because to
me

488
00:27:35,940 --> 00:27:39,110
what matters is arm pairing people up

489
00:27:39,110 --> 00:27:43,470
one by one and finding out who needs to
be there so he was the guy who made

490
00:27:43,470 --> 00:27:44,460
printer Persia

491
00:27:44,460 --> 00:27:48,070
he was a guy who could transfer a disk

492
00:27:48,070 --> 00:27:50,799
so he brought over a whole bunch of
things now we brought our way more than

493
00:27:50,799 --> 00:27:54,240
we needed to because wired was shooting
the process and wired a story on it but

494
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:56,059
a lot of that material was used

495
00:27:56,059 --> 00:27:59,860
to make sure we got it and we got it we
definitely got

496
00:27:59,860 --> 00:28:03,130
the original source code a prince a
Persia of this

497
00:28:03,130 --> 00:28:06,210
old floppy disk and soul this

498
00:28:06,210 --> 00:28:10,990
when people were discussing it it turns
out that 20 people here know Apple to

499
00:28:10,990 --> 00:28:11,460
use

500
00:28:11,460 --> 00:28:14,559
I don't mean that there's an applet not
able to existed

501
00:28:14,559 --> 00:28:18,510
the people here like Apple to like
anything about if I say that instead of

502
00:28:18,510 --> 00:28:21,390
a sixteen sector disc they will begin
18sec two-disc

503
00:28:21,390 --> 00:28:25,500
deal with all okay I get one back here
okay

504
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:30,690
well get lower let me tell your arm 16
sectors is the standard Apple thing but

505
00:28:30,690 --> 00:28:32,360
the guy in the rolling Gustafson

506
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:35,840
wrote this very unique protection system
back then

507
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:40,909
called RW 18 which enabled him to put 18
sectors on a disc which meant for

508
00:28:40,909 --> 00:28:41,750
stovall

509
00:28:41,750 --> 00:28:46,610
everybody's copy program didn't work and
second want to put enormous amount to

510
00:28:46,610 --> 00:28:50,350
date on a comparatively right not to 10
percent or 5 percent of data

511
00:28:50,350 --> 00:28:54,440
if he put it in there right okay when he
saw when will we got

512
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:59,059
dusting himself saw people on Metafilter
discussing the protection system

513
00:28:59,059 --> 00:29:02,110
he found his old floppy and made
available

514
00:29:02,110 --> 00:29:06,059
and proceeded to jump into the whole
discussion to say here's why I didn't

515
00:29:06,059 --> 00:29:07,309
use what's going on

516
00:29:07,309 --> 00:29:11,340
and he's been excitedly involved since
he had the stuff just sittin around

517
00:29:11,340 --> 00:29:15,409
thinkin nobody cared old old story

518
00:29:15,409 --> 00:29:20,539
I'm done here and so he jumped out of
nowhere and so this history gets saved

519
00:29:20,539 --> 00:29:24,429
your two games Jordan make your made
before his first game

520
00:29:24,429 --> 00:29:28,049
which was called karateka one was an
asteroid clone the brought the

521
00:29:28,049 --> 00:29:28,830
broderbund

522
00:29:28,830 --> 00:29:32,230
right on that time there were few
lawsuits about look and feel suburban

523
00:29:32,230 --> 00:29:33,510
dropped the idea but it is a

524
00:29:33,510 --> 00:29:36,700
Apple to perfect example asteroids

525
00:29:36,700 --> 00:29:40,270
and the right one is a game called death
bounce which he also worked on which

526
00:29:40,270 --> 00:29:41,970
they decided to turn on

527
00:29:41,970 --> 00:29:46,070
but because we were saving this he saved
these we put the disk images up people

528
00:29:46,070 --> 00:29:48,770
are running the manipulators in these
games that have been away for almost 30

529
00:29:48,770 --> 00:29:50,779
years live again

530
00:29:50,779 --> 00:29:55,140
and of course if you got he cast if you
got the assembly language source a

531
00:29:55,140 --> 00:29:56,039
printer pressure

532
00:29:56,039 --> 00:30:03,039
certainly go ahead and put it on github
sulk

533
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:06,429
so yeah we ended up putting it on github
and arm

534
00:30:06,429 --> 00:30:10,419
you know my favorite bit was like feel
people would not people been looking at

535
00:30:10,419 --> 00:30:12,940
it and apparently it's really good
assembly source like

536
00:30:12,940 --> 00:30:17,520
Jordan told me again this is a story but
Jordan told me basically that he

537
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:22,289
arm new that the previous game karateka

538
00:30:22,289 --> 00:30:25,340
had not been ported very well because he
had written such dense

539
00:30:25,340 --> 00:30:29,419
assembly language code the know we can
read it so he was

540
00:30:29,419 --> 00:30:32,169
you know in the course that them into
ports work and crappy they were kind of

541
00:30:32,169 --> 00:30:34,909
taking the look they were kind of a king
but way it was

542
00:30:34,909 --> 00:30:38,520
so he said commitments was clean as
possible that turns out to be a really

543
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:39,850
good thing because now

544
00:30:39,850 --> 00:30:43,260
the sources unbelievably readable

545
00:30:43,260 --> 00:30:47,710
um what really love is a course nobody's
really compiled it yet look for someone

546
00:30:47,710 --> 00:30:49,980
to actually go ahead and try and compile
it

547
00:30:49,980 --> 00:30:53,779
arm and I was really pissed somebody
said like can you tell me how to compel

548
00:30:53,779 --> 00:30:55,309
they said no you should open an issue

549
00:30:55,309 --> 00:30:59,059
he open issue saying it like to compile
it and somebody wrote like

550
00:30:59,059 --> 00:31:04,908
it's all there in close the issue click
thanks dick bagged

551
00:31:04,909 --> 00:31:08,750
but I do love the fact that somebody
when an

552
00:31:08,750 --> 00:31:13,600
went into the source did a branch
believed all the disc protection

553
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:17,220
and I was like there you go sure-fire
parenting technique

554
00:31:17,220 --> 00:31:22,419
game comes out week eighteen years

555
00:31:22,419 --> 00:31:26,309
so I get open source remove the copy
protection easily copied

556
00:31:26,309 --> 00:31:30,700
up cracked

557
00:31:30,700 --> 00:31:36,340
cracked by time I right or am I going
with all this

558
00:31:36,340 --> 00:31:41,470
this is a better lie in arm this is is
lying is actually entirely made up the

559
00:31:41,470 --> 00:31:41,890
butter

560
00:31:41,890 --> 00:31:45,160
I don't know why why did they make a
hold

561
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:48,250
I felt really bad using his paws to make
my bagel

562
00:31:48,250 --> 00:31:52,550
be bothered I think everybody on that
cruise

563
00:31:52,550 --> 00:31:55,879
was kind of really respectful a better
lie in

564
00:31:55,880 --> 00:32:00,150
nothing about a bar Lions Majesty says
please take me

565
00:32:00,150 --> 00:32:05,040
he says I will buy I will look at you
from my

566
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:10,470
my dairy thrown in inspectors you get
fatter on whatever it is you're eating

567
00:32:10,470 --> 00:32:11,570
at two in the morning

568
00:32:11,570 --> 00:32:15,139
cruises have midnight chocolate
fountains what the fuck

569
00:32:15,140 --> 00:32:19,660
a wood so

570
00:32:19,660 --> 00:32:23,060
here's a robot messenger displaced
person to person note in public this is

571
00:32:23,060 --> 00:32:24,570
from 1935

572
00:32:24,570 --> 00:32:28,129
people wanna make appointments are
informed friends their whereabouts

573
00:32:28,130 --> 00:32:31,610
you basically have been called a
notifier you walk up

574
00:32:31,610 --> 00:32:35,070
you read a brief message on a trip with
paper then it goes up behind where it

575
00:32:35,070 --> 00:32:38,450
remains in public view for two hours so
another person goes by and read it

576
00:32:38,450 --> 00:32:45,450
yes that is right 1935 instant messaging
here's an end anti-piracy adn

577
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:50,699
for corn harvesters from the eighteen
hundreds

578
00:32:50,700 --> 00:32:54,030
warning you to look out for those cheap
knock-off

579
00:32:54,030 --> 00:32:59,500
corn harvesters that it had you have to
make sure it has our trademark on it

580
00:32:59,500 --> 00:33:03,100
and that you were gonna be liable for
damages

581
00:33:03,100 --> 00:33:08,090
if you make use or sell infringing
calling harvesting machines

582
00:33:08,090 --> 00:33:14,430
nothing changes when the fire alarm went
off it took two hours to evacuate the

583
00:33:14,430 --> 00:33:16,460

00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:32,050
is that arm its tell you that a new
batch

602
00:34:32,050 --> 00:34:36,649
%uh negroes has arrived but it's very
careful to tell you

603
00:34:36,649 --> 00:34:41,949
that some with them a really skilled
seamstresses chamber maids field hands

604
00:34:41,949 --> 00:34:46,500
and the thing is is that it's saying
these are human beings

605
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:52,570
but they're really school this is an
incredible mental gymnastic

606
00:34:52,570 --> 00:34:56,929
and one that us looking a hundred years
later go what the fuck dude

607
00:34:56,929 --> 00:35:01,340
what the fuck and the fact is that in
many years to Hans people look at us

608
00:35:01,340 --> 00:35:02,660
right now what's up

609
00:35:02,660 --> 00:35:08,620
fuck okay century after century is the
previous century going what the fuck

610
00:35:08,620 --> 00:35:13,170
and then the next one going with the
fuck wrong with you and the way we know

611
00:35:13,170 --> 00:35:14,950
all these crazy things

612
00:35:14,950 --> 00:35:18,589
all these insane things about asbestosis
shooting yourself with the cold

613
00:35:18,590 --> 00:35:23,080
cocaine ivory is because all these
represent and unbroken chain

614
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:26,830
of people agreeing not to destroy this
history a gang

615
00:35:26,830 --> 00:35:30,549
every one of these things has passed
through hands have been kept the side

616
00:35:30,550 --> 00:35:32,810
and they didn't make the decision to
destroy

617
00:35:32,810 --> 00:35:36,880
this is one of my core principles is
it's not my

618
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:39,960
job not my right to destroy

619
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:43,200
history and not to let others destroy
history

620
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:47,270
let the next 100 years decide what's
funny what's not get rid of it

621
00:35:47,270 --> 00:35:51,050
but no it's not our job but keep it
around a little bit longer

622
00:35:51,050 --> 00:35:56,590
could that possibly earlier to get
funnier so little about dying

623
00:35:56,590 --> 00:36:02,330
so is my demonstration part

624
00:36:02,330 --> 00:36:05,430
in our poll twenty maker 20 maker

625
00:36:05,430 --> 00:36:08,589
you twenty 20 milligrams playmaker grams

626
00:36:08,590 --> 00:36:11,620
up

627
00:36:11,620 --> 00:36:15,020
he was never heard from again global

628
00:36:15,020 --> 00:36:19,840
me dislike success

629
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:23,440
and what a pain desolate 10 milligram

630
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:30,260
take one tablet by mouth protect game

631
00:36:30,260 --> 00:36:35,680

632
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:42,060
alright so sweet to you allopurinol 300
milligram tablets take one tablet

eat

635
00:36:55,090 --> 00:36:56,510
and that's why I'm a life

636
00:36:56,510 --> 00:37:01,120
I did something called chasen's gots
about clothes laid off from my job

637
00:37:01,120 --> 00:37:04,359
but three years ago and I was like well
that sucked

638
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:08,540
what can I do I know and member this was
a few years ago

639
00:37:08,540 --> 00:37:13,060
let's use Kickstarter I was very open
the first uses a Kickstarter

640
00:37:13,060 --> 00:37:17,759
which means I had this Haasan
Kickstarter give me a lot of money

641
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:22,349
and I will spend all a bit

642
00:37:22,349 --> 00:37:24,890
people make the joke I lived the joke

643
00:37:24,890 --> 00:37:28,730
Scott Burgess's got sabbatical I show
people what I've been up to for all

644
00:37:28,730 --> 00:37:30,250
those years before

645
00:37:30,250 --> 00:37:33,809
all these projects you're seeing all
these things and I said you know what

646
00:37:33,809 --> 00:37:38,319
instead of turning computer history in
my sideline my hobby

647
00:37:38,319 --> 00:37:43,230
let's make it my life so if you guys
give me money I will spend at least a

648
00:37:43,230 --> 00:37:44,170
year doing that

649
00:37:44,170 --> 00:37:49,270
and finding something new so they did
they gave me thirty thousand dollars

650
00:37:49,270 --> 00:37:53,359
I lived on that for about a year and a
half along with selling documentaries I

651
00:37:53,359 --> 00:37:56,259
finished my second documentary and I was
doing really well

652
00:37:56,260 --> 00:37:59,559
on my own until I was doing a showing

653
00:37:59,559 --> 00:38:04,160
and there was something wrong with my
cell phone what was wrong with my cell

654
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:07,660
phone is it had a dead spot on it and I
was really pissed cuz I just bought the

655
00:38:07,660 --> 00:38:08,379
cell phone

656
00:38:08,380 --> 00:38:12,980
into a close my left eye and noticed
that the spot wasn't there

657
00:38:12,980 --> 00:38:16,569
metals like now that's really strange

658
00:38:16,569 --> 00:38:20,599
so it really turned out as I was driving
home my father said we really should

659
00:38:20,599 --> 00:38:23,690
you should go to the opthamologist
tomorrow just get a look at that

660
00:38:23,690 --> 00:38:26,819
I go in there and the opthamologist goes
I'm going to take one picture viewer I

661
00:38:26,819 --> 00:38:28,380
know if the drive immediately to the in

662
00:38:28,380 --> 00:38:31,890
emergency room turns out you should
because they took my blood pressure

663
00:38:31,890 --> 00:38:37,520
and your blood pressure should not be
220 over 180 turned out about the stroke

664
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:37,930
out

665
00:38:37,930 --> 00:38:41,609
turned out I have unbelievably high
blood pressure turns out I'm big

666
00:38:41,609 --> 00:38:46,089
I pretend to day Greek

667
00:38:46,089 --> 00:38:50,740
I to bud

668
00:38:50,740 --> 00:38:54,349
I started to fight with them over this

669
00:38:54,349 --> 00:38:58,690
because they gave me a arm they gave me

670
00:38:58,690 --> 00:39:01,970
%uh some medicine to stabilize my blood
pressure I

671
00:39:01,970 --> 00:39:04,980
I didn't wanna stakes and you might be
expensive I had no insurance

672
00:39:04,980 --> 00:39:08,520
and the guy said you cut this day you're
gonna die first aid

673
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:11,780
I came over and I got eighteen thousand
dollar hospital stabile

674
00:39:11,780 --> 00:39:16,349
which was a lot of money turns out for
somebody doesn't have any

675
00:39:16,349 --> 00:39:19,630
soul you know I we start to make those

676
00:39:19,630 --> 00:39:23,460
terrible decisions I can still see

677
00:39:23,460 --> 00:39:27,400
I don't need to enjoy 3d movies

678
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:32,829
I can probably get by and I was fighting
the next two times the way into the

679
00:39:32,829 --> 00:39:36,010
hospital %uh to not go

680
00:39:36,010 --> 00:39:39,369
to not take care of myself to not stay
alive

681
00:39:39,369 --> 00:39:42,500
because it would cost me too much money
okay

682
00:39:42,500 --> 00:39:45,390
so not the political but anyone who
talks about health insurance like it's

683
00:39:45,390 --> 00:39:47,710
not something you need to have is just
full of cock

684
00:39:47,710 --> 00:39:54,710
because I was gonna die now eventually I
was able to get my hands

685
00:39:56,750 --> 00:40:00,430
on insurance and I was able to get back
on the train

686
00:40:00,430 --> 00:40:03,430
okay these pills without insurance that
you just saw

687
00:40:03,430 --> 00:40:06,980
a one-month supply was a hundred and
thirty dollars

688
00:40:06,980 --> 00:40:10,079
on insurance it's 12 sold

689
00:40:10,079 --> 00:40:14,710
I like the insurance version and I take
them everyday in my blood pressure has

690
00:40:14,710 --> 00:40:16,119
been normal for two years

691
00:40:16,119 --> 00:40:19,440
are one of those is allopurinol that's
not for that's for gal

692
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:22,319
if anyone remembers the deaf can I go
around on a Segway that was because I

693
00:40:22,319 --> 00:40:23,259
could not walk

694
00:40:23,260 --> 00:40:28,170
I can walk now just fine I am NOT a
kidney stone in two years

695
00:40:28,170 --> 00:40:31,890
again because I'm on these drugs because
I work here

696
00:40:31,890 --> 00:40:36,920
I work for the Internet Archive because
I gave a talk about archive team how

697
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:37,920
important it was

698
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:42,490
and then I went downstairs and said you
should hire me and they hired me

699
00:40:42,490 --> 00:40:46,099
no resume

700
00:40:46,099 --> 00:40:49,220
just me and it worked

701
00:40:49,220 --> 00:40:54,040
I am i official title is free range
archivist I work for the Internet

702
00:40:54,040 --> 00:40:55,609
Archive in San Francisco

703
00:40:55,609 --> 00:40:59,900
one of the finest places in the world I
love this place

704
00:40:59,900 --> 00:41:04,819
this nineteen petabytes and Psyche hey
that I know of

705
00:41:04,819 --> 00:41:08,529
I mean that literally case if I come in
later on but with that

706
00:41:08,530 --> 00:41:13,369
another pedal bike each one of those
tried using there's three terabytes

707
00:41:13,369 --> 00:41:16,680
it's funny because

708
00:41:16,680 --> 00:41:19,569
the things that we kinda bothered me
about stuff is you know people would

709
00:41:19,569 --> 00:41:21,040
know the Wayback Machine

710
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:25,359
but the Wayback Machine is to the
Internet Archive liquid Monaco

711
00:41:25,359 --> 00:41:29,220
is to like Europe they do so much work

712
00:41:29,220 --> 00:41:33,339
they do so much work they're working so
hard to save so much a computer history

713
00:41:33,339 --> 00:41:37,160
that that people just think oh well I'll
just for instance Open Library

714
00:41:37,160 --> 00:41:41,290
.org which is their brave lending and
borrowing books and you can use it if

715
00:41:41,290 --> 00:41:43,680
you have a library card with a lot of
libraries

716
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:46,680
is a fascinating beautiful thing and
they clicked

717
00:41:46,680 --> 00:41:49,828
all sorts of material the Grateful Dead
archive goes there

718
00:41:49,829 --> 00:41:54,230
there's all sorts of radio programs old
stuff tapes books

719
00:41:54,230 --> 00:41:58,589
the digitizer new book every 90 seconds
their work in it

720
00:41:58,589 --> 00:42:02,349
I love being a part of them now because
I'm a bombastic

721
00:42:02,349 --> 00:42:05,750
asshole not allowed to speak for them so
I'm speaking to you as a fan

722
00:42:05,750 --> 00:42:10,440
not as a representation over the
Internet Archive make that clear

723
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:14,130
at the Internet Archive I have been able
to with my admin access do things for

724
00:42:14,130 --> 00:42:15,460
instance here's a collection

725
00:42:15,460 --> 00:42:19,089
a 400 arcade manuals because I thought

726
00:42:19,089 --> 00:42:22,349
you know the worst thing in the world
for an arcade machine is to not have the

727
00:42:22,349 --> 00:42:22,990
manual

728
00:42:22,990 --> 00:42:26,510
and somebody decides not to buy it and I
hate these fuckers who sell them for

729
00:42:26,510 --> 00:42:28,299
forty dollars apiece

730
00:42:28,299 --> 00:42:31,410
let's put them all on line so their

music

752
00:43:50,589 --> 00:43:55,529

you know it's barely a terabyte are you
kidding me a 10

754
00:43:58,980 --> 00:44:04,140
it's a good speech apparently so

know what the hell makeup me

770
00:44:55,950 --> 00:45:00,810
other than not die but I really
appreciate that he believes that I'm

771
00:45:00,810 --> 00:45:04,430
doing the right thing alternately here's
Rick Prelinger

772
00:45:04,430 --> 00:45:09,680
and Megan probably your on the prego
archives

773
00:45:09,680 --> 00:45:13,430
every time we go out there is a mutual
admiration society with the two of us

774
00:45:13,430 --> 00:45:16,919
he is my hero he does things this is his
library

775
00:45:16,920 --> 00:45:21,180
that he has for public consumption E
they opened up a few times a week

776
00:45:21,180 --> 00:45:24,970
tons of material tons of material
including

777
00:45:24,970 --> 00:45:29,779
arm a some fight you know as a result of
having all this material

778
00:45:29,779 --> 00:45:33,700
they have also two things that are like
they don't even know they had that stuff

779
00:45:33,700 --> 00:45:38,160
I found this this is the famous ramparts
article that the telephone system

780
00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:42,009
%uh Bell Telephone had ripped out and
destroyed everywhere

781
00:45:42,010 --> 00:45:45,270
except apparently MacPro leaders
collection

782
00:45:45,270 --> 00:45:48,730
so I found that will jam is called
wriggling the phone company in your home

783
00:45:48,730 --> 00:45:51,760
it's what really really really pissed
them off

784
00:45:51,760 --> 00:45:55,069
so pray it lives this is Henry Lowood

785
00:45:55,069 --> 00:45:58,759
he works in Stamford on his left
actually is JP Dyson that the guy

786
00:45:58,760 --> 00:46:00,810
looking really bored with the glasses

787
00:46:00,810 --> 00:46:04,509
he runs the strong museum of play which
it has thousands and thousands and

788
00:46:04,510 --> 00:46:07,319
thousands of video games dolls and
everything else they have a complete set

789
00:46:07,319 --> 00:46:10,230
complete set all the Lionel trains

790
00:46:10,230 --> 00:46:14,810
arm just amazing amount of stuff but you
know henry's gotten pretty amazing shit

791
00:46:14,810 --> 00:46:18,490
Bob this joker attach is going to be
calling you somebody

792
00:46:18,490 --> 00:46:22,529
at we just week-old recommended also

793
00:46:22,529 --> 00:46:27,510
am theory just McKenna recommended us
%uh the district guys they build kits

794
00:46:27,510 --> 00:46:30,920
operate out of garage

795
00:46:30,920 --> 00:46:33,980
wanted for nothing

796
00:46:33,980 --> 00:46:39,000
and on the other side is Steve Jobs home
phone number

797
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:42,980
this is the original schematic for the
Apple one that was submitted while at

798
00:46:42,980 --> 00:46:46,460
working at HP to HP the HP rejected

799
00:46:46,460 --> 00:46:51,790
so I got the touch that feels like
history

800
00:46:51,790 --> 00:46:55,170
you know I'm doing all sorts of projects
and doing all sorts of things

801
00:46:55,170 --> 00:46:58,180
and the thing is is that arm

802
00:46:58,180 --> 00:47:02,230
I'll when I say that I work on these
projects I mean that there's a constant

803
00:47:02,230 --> 00:47:04,560
stream of things that interest me that I
go into

804
00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:09,569
right cray disc this is a great disc
representational where somebody from

805
00:47:09,569 --> 00:47:13,579
Australia road with it in their lap to
take to New York

806
00:47:13,579 --> 00:47:18,599
were eighty Rd Felton used a yard we
know controlled magnetic recorder to

807
00:47:18,599 --> 00:47:19,579
record

808
00:47:19,579 --> 00:47:23,819
gigabyte large messages are recordings
of this 128

809
00:47:23,819 --> 00:47:27,040
meg disc back so that we could rescue

810
00:47:27,040 --> 00:47:30,810
what may be the last complete version of
the Quail West on this is somebody

811
00:47:30,810 --> 00:47:32,130
scanning Abril playboy

812
00:47:32,130 --> 00:47:36,690
I thought that was hilarious there's a
whole buncha people who are working on

813
00:47:36,690 --> 00:47:38,630
setting history with stuff like this

814
00:47:38,630 --> 00:47:41,329
where basically there emulating if you
look on the bottom that's how any

815
00:47:41,329 --> 00:47:42,750
leaders tend to look

816
00:47:42,750 --> 00:47:45,930
when it comes to things like the 2600
but that's not how it was there with the

817
00:47:45,930 --> 00:47:47,578
shitty securities

818
00:47:47,579 --> 00:47:50,790
so over the top people making software
emulation of CIT's

819
00:47:50,790 --> 00:47:54,040
here's a fairly emulated CRT

820
00:47:54,040 --> 00:47:57,319
where somebody simulating all the
different aspects to this thing

821
00:47:57,319 --> 00:48:00,910
these are years and years and years at
the Game Developers Conference

822
00:48:00,910 --> 00:48:04,520
proceedings that I have been digitizing
for them just everything from the 90's

823
00:48:04,520 --> 00:48:06,009
that these people talk done

824
00:48:06,009 --> 00:48:09,680
many many many hours %uh gaming history

825
00:48:09,680 --> 00:48:13,440

826
00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:18,609
4 because and getting old and it's time
to just get shit done so one is called

827

arcades

828
00:48:21,829 --> 00:48:25,380
I've been shooting this for about a year
under his tape

829
00:48:25,380 --> 00:48:28,900
the medium lift APS all a bit magnetic

830
00:48:28,900 --> 00:48:32,240
audio magnetic I say magnetic audio and
video

831
00:48:32,240 --> 00:48:35,660

a documentary on the 6502 chip the
software

833
00:48:39,190 --> 00:48:42,259

than interviewing bill budge

834
00:48:42,259 --> 00:48:45,980
about pinball construction set and at
the bottom actually working on a

835
00:48:45,980 --> 00:48:48,310
documentary for Def Con which is a

836
00:48:48,310 --> 00:48:52,619
having its 20th my really has gone down

837
00:48:52,619 --> 00:48:55,670
arm

838
00:48:55,670 --> 00:48:58,710
high five to you and I'm

839
00:48:58,710 --> 00:49:02,359
you know the thing is is like I'm on
this journey now

840
00:49:02,359 --> 00:49:06,348
right this journey both crazies and

841
00:49:06,349 --> 00:49:10,329
computer emulation and telling our
stories

842
00:49:10,329 --> 00:49:14,029
and I wanted somebody to some people are
going to look at a single what happens a

843
00:49:14,029 --> 00:49:15,450
little more shit

844
00:49:15,450 --> 00:49:18,859
was a lot so it was nice

845
00:49:18,859 --> 00:49:22,359
but I also want you to say here's my
journey thats were I Wed

846
00:49:22,359 --> 00:49:25,259
I went from the boy who thought he lost
everything to the boy who is saving

847
00:49:25,259 --> 00:49:26,680
everything

848
00:49:26,680 --> 00:49:30,990
and I want you to remember on your
journey that you too can become somebody

849
00:49:30,990 --> 00:49:34,319
greater than yourself think the world in
a way that you may not have before and

850
00:49:34,319 --> 00:49:35,910
the work that you do

851
00:49:35,910 --> 00:49:41,490
being not just some simple self-directed
way to make a few more dollars into you

852
00:49:41,490 --> 00:49:42,099
wake up

853
00:49:42,099 --> 00:49:47,740
one to your cell phone has a spot on it
and instead to start thinking about

854
00:49:47,740 --> 00:49:53,779
what can I do to make my dreams of what
the world should be come true

855
00:49:53,779 --> 00:49:57,079
I think that's something that maybe we
could walk away from feeling very good

856
00:49:57,079 --> 00:49:58,200
about ourselves

857
00:49:58,200 --> 00:50:04,759
at the end of the day thanks a lot man
