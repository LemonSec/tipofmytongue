heard the story of how this contest we
had ended I really wanted to share it

315
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:12,460
with that with everyone here

316
00:21:12,460 --> 00:21:16,299
how many people saw there were these
locks outside the lockpick village

317
00:21:16,299 --> 00:21:18,539
occasionally on a Saturday these little

318
00:21:18,539 --> 00:21:23,360
pillars unlocks around the conference
what those words that was a master key

319
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:26,659
system today's contest this helps
contest was

320
00:21:26,659 --> 00:21:30,909
escalator action escalating your
privilege to a master key system

321
00:21:30,909 --> 00:21:34,570
Matt blaze from you panic published in
other people talked about this for years

322
00:21:34,570 --> 00:21:35,240
but

323
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:38,280
we never really know anyone who did it
physically because you need

324
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:42,168
master lock so we built this we had
teams running around

325
00:21:42,169 --> 00:21:46,799
comparing keys filing in testing
extrapolating out key data

326
00:21:46,799 --> 00:21:50,720
and really getting close and it actually
took about almost three hours till one

327
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:51,549
person

328
00:21:51,549 --> 00:21:55,040
gene own actually is to be with you know
his body they came up I think we got the

329
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:58,280
key like alright let's test it in our
top lock handful

330
00:21:58,280 --> 00:22:01,940
your hand file completely it was great
you could do the whole contest

331
00:22:01,940 --> 00:22:05,130
with basically no money you could use
public tools and files all manually they

332
00:22:05,130 --> 00:22:05,929
did that

333
00:22:05,929 --> 00:22:09,309
and lamb in that room does not there was
cheering

334
00:22:09,309 --> 00:22:12,389
and after that we should start giving me
some hints at that eventually alright

335
00:22:12,389 --> 00:22:13,169
everyone look

336
00:22:13,169 --> 00:22:17,280
like this position you all the tip it's
not master don't worry about that

337
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:21,658
a while later Mike aren't however if you
look all your cheese have another

338
00:22:21,659 --> 00:22:25,240
piece it's all the same if you can there
was not comparing their keys like

339
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:29,490
all this gonna be 60 K that's okay now
given hots and Colton

340
00:22:29,490 --> 00:22:33,149
people would cut a key and I believe
alright you there was team delaware the

341
00:22:33,149 --> 00:22:34,020
big team

342
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:37,450
I got huge Hickey you have four
positions correct

343
00:22:37,450 --> 00:22:41,480
all men are in the chest you can cut
this for us to give us a key code and i

344
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:42,500
guess i

345
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:47,490
is Yuki you three positions correct
makes sense

346
00:22:47,490 --> 00:22:51,179
an all-time the Germans they're doing
rather find the runaround

347
00:22:51,179 --> 00:22:54,780
finally team delaware comes up and
they're like they've got they've got all

348
00:22:54,780 --> 00:22:55,090
the

349
00:22:55,090 --> 00:22:58,939
checked my all the notes everything's
good mchugh going alright

350
00:22:58,940 --> 00:23:02,690
could occur here's your key you have one
position

351
00:23:02,690 --> 00:23:09,040
off by one an illegal got here just a
screw it making five please

352
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:13,168
alright I'm leading machine run it's
cutting he's the Germans have now run

353
00:23:13,169 --> 00:23:14,190
all around

354
00:23:14,190 --> 00:23:17,230
testing their work they like we think we
have it

355
00:23:17,230 --> 00:23:20,840
we think this is working key and of
course delaware's there waiting for

356
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:22,490
their key to come on a machine

357
00:23:22,490 --> 00:23:27,130
ever like alright moment damn second
place

358
00:23:27,130 --> 00:23:30,649

and third

362
00:23:41,270 --> 00:23:48,270

a huge diversity over workshops there
was a the foil workshop at the one that

496
00:31:36,350 --> 00:31:39,070
really stood out to me there was an
aerobics workshop that was

497
00:31:39,070 --> 00:31:43,649
what's that but the other was the
aerobics workshop that was mst3k style

to handle press and I just wanted to
mention know we heard

504
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:08,190
probably the biggest press interest at
ever seen a hook conference

505
00:32:08,190 --> 00:32:13,750
so and and thank you so much Cheshire

security desk as long as we're at the

577
00:37:04,780 --> 00:37:05,740

and not related to fundraising butter we
had a very active amateur radio

673
00:43:22,359 --> 00:43:24,819
community ham radio here we have station
over here

674
00:43:24,819 --> 00:43:28,808
the FCC a special event station call
sign was and nine th

675
00:43:28,809 --> 00:43:32,940
be contacted the probably over 15
different countries

676
00:43:32,940 --> 00:43:36,799
the Czech Republic Russia cuba

677
00:43:36,799 --> 00:43:41,200
I Germany Costa Rica Venezuela too many
to mention

678
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:44,539
my favorite contact with either a low
speed data communications

679
00:43:44,539 --> 00:43:48,369
between right here in 18th floor and
these respective stations in each

680
00:43:48,369 --> 00:43:50,769
respective countries a contact from cuba

681
00:43:50,769 --> 00:43:55,890
on tight back to S a 73 hackers which is
like a

682
00:43:55,890 --> 00:43:59,930
amateur radio shorthand for reich best
wishes and good luck hackers

683
00:43:59,930 --> 00:44:04,098
so that that came directly from cuba and
with no infrastructure between us

684
00:44:04,099 --> 00:44:11,099
and then we just a few what's a power I
think that's really impressive stuff

685
00:44:14,749 --> 00:44:17,950
and that generated so much interest that
we had about a

686

754
00:48:25,940 --> 00:48:30,000

plus for Kyle will be introducing our

755
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:31,010
sponsors

756
00:48:31,010 --> 00:48:38,010
for anybody have here

757
00:48:42,339 --> 00:48:45,209
yeah I'm a little nervous I do wanna um

758
00:48:45,209 --> 00:48:48,509
basically think a 3-over three sponsors

759
00:48:48,509 --> 00:48:51,759
I had the the pleasure of representing
arm

760
00:48:51,759 --> 00:48:55,660
%uh you on behalf like 2600 and

761
00:48:55,660 --> 00:48:59,839
and hope and arm that was not easy I was
a little tricky and and

762
00:48:59,839 --> 00:49:02,910
typically 2610 hope haven't really open

763
00:49:02,910 --> 00:49:06,879
been very open to to sponsor so that's a
whose new territory and

764
00:49:06,880 --> 00:49:11,920
a bit strange to do but we wanted to
keep its are classified as

765
00:49:11,920 --> 00:49:15,190
technical sponsors not like just anybody
with the

766
00:49:15,190 --> 00:49:19,160
checkbook kind of thing on and it went
in a lot of really really weird in

767
00:49:19,160 --> 00:49:20,899
unexpected ways I am

768

tray specter is our new company they do
I D S

789
00:50:29,559 --> 00:50:32,640
intrusion detection stuff and arm

790
00:50:32,640 --> 00:50:37,549
day I up they're actually

791
00:50:37,549 --> 00:50:41,420
a new company and I was started by fiber
optic who is a friend

792
00:50:41,420 --> 00:50:44,930
hope and 2600 and they paid for um

793
00:50:44,930 --> 00:50:51,930
half OVR bandwidth costs so we're really
thankful for

794
00:50:56,180 --> 00:50:59,118
com I could go on and on I really wanna
thank everybody for coming

795
00:50:59,119 --> 00:51:02,039
and I having a time I had a lot of
people come up to me and say they were

796
00:51:02,039 --> 00:51:04,049
really enjoying it and they really
thankful

797
00:51:04,049 --> 00:51:07,759
for you know the interesting theme in
and an election stuff

798
00:51:07,760 --> 00:51:12,329
on anyway I i do want to ask did anybody
happen to

799
00:51:12,329 --> 00:51:15,720
run their passport a under a blacklight

800
00:51:15,720 --> 00:51:20,800
really

801
00:51:20,800 --> 00:51:23,760
killing nobody was just like well maybe
it's good

802
00:51:23,760 --> 00:51:27,680
okay anywhere we did for like a little

803
00:51:27,680 --> 00:51:31,130
security feature on the past four and it
wasn't

804
00:51:31,130 --> 00:51:36,290
we was basically me and I basically
stamped all your passports with

805
00:51:36,290 --> 00:51:37,210
invisible ink

806
00:51:37,210 --> 00:51:40,700
so if you put under a blacklight there's
a there's little smiley face I don't

807
00:51:40,700 --> 00:51:41,580
know if you can see it

808
00:51:41,580 --> 00:51:44,799
so there you go thats RNR any

809
00:51:44,800 --> 00:51:48,710
anti-counterfeiting so but we really
didn't have any problems at that it was

810
00:51:48,710 --> 00:51:50,340
just something we put their that no one

811
00:51:50,340 --> 00:51:54,220
really knew about so anyway and that's
why I could go on and on but thanks

812
00:51:54,220 --> 00:51:55,260
again for coming and %ah

813
00:51:55,260 --> 00:52:02,260
I think the nixon introduce somebody you
might all recognize

814
00:52:07,290 --> 00:52:11,380
so this is the ninth hackers on planet
earth conference

815
00:52:11,380 --> 00:52:14,630
and how huge applause

816
00:52:14,630 --> 00:52:21,630
if you had a great time give yourselves
a round of applause

817
00:52:25,610 --> 00:52:28,670
I I've been coming up covers for really
really long time

818
00:52:28,670 --> 00:52:34,370
and I think we all are really special
huge round of things

819
00:52:34,370 --> 00:52:37,480
and applause to Emmanuel Goldstein who
made

820
00:52:37,480 --> 00:52:41,930
all this possible and 20s enterprise
give it up give it up you choose from

821
00:52:41,930 --> 00:52:48,930
fire the

822
00:52:51,299 --> 00:52:56,150
claims

823
00:52:56,150 --> 00:53:00,640
I appreciate that but it's really not
true because I might have had the idea

824
00:53:00,640 --> 00:53:02,879
long time ago for hackers on planet
earth but

825
00:53:02,880 --> 00:53:07,120
you guys make it possible by by speaking
by coming Bolland hearing

826
00:53:07,120 --> 00:53:10,730

829
00:53:17,460 --> 00:53:18,140
people

830
00:53:18,140 --> 00:53:21,330

are in the background

831
00:53:21,330 --> 00:53:25,870
I Robin area at the store who have been
here night and day for the last three

832
00:53:25,870 --> 00:53:26,330
days

833
00:53:26,330 --> 00:53:29,640
all the folks have been selling out a
downstairs and upstairs now

834
00:53:29,640 --> 00:53:33,720
I actually interesting statistic we and

835
00:53:33,720 --> 00:53:34,530

836
00:53:34,530 --> 00:53:41,530
weekend as an American record in Germany

possible to to have a record of this so

840
00:53:53,140 --> 00:53:53,790
we can all

841
00:53:53,790 --> 00:53:57,690
look back in the future and and see just
how funny we look years ago

842
00:53:57,690 --> 00:54:01,590

each other when hope was really all
about are like everyone has been saying

846
00:54:11,990 --> 00:54:16,260
hope is unique II got a buncha
conferences throughout the world

847
00:54:16,260 --> 00:54:20,480
and I like to think this one it has its
own special flavor I think it always has

848
00:54:20,480 --> 00:54:24,610
and we mix it up we we we bring people
from all different backgrounds walks of

849
00:54:24,610 --> 00:54:25,520
life together

850
00:54:25,520 --> 00:54:30,410
are keynotes certainly I demonstrated
that way and any from the NSA and the

851
00:54:30,410 --> 00:54:31,330
Yes Men

852
00:54:31,330 --> 00:54:34,990

talks we had

853

even find room for soul who knows might

856
00:54:44,620 --> 00:54:45,560
have to expand

857
00:54:45,560 --> 00:54:48,779
even more in the future I think we've
had more people here this time than ever

858
00:54:48,780 --> 00:54:49,750
before World War

859
