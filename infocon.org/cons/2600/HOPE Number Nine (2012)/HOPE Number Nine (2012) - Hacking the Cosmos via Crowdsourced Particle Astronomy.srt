1
00:00:16,090 --> 00:00:19,170
okay I guess adjusters

2
00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:24,279
the this session was to start at seven
so it's a few minutes after so I guess I

3
00:00:24,279 --> 00:00:24,890
can

4
00:00:24,890 --> 00:00:28,699
I can start okay alright so

5
00:00:28,699 --> 00:00:33,489
my name is Romeo I'm a professor physics

6
00:00:33,489 --> 00:00:37,169
an astronomy at Florida A&M University

7
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:41,010
home on the director up the ass for
particle in cosmic radiation detector

8
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:43,809
research and development laboratory I

9
00:00:43,809 --> 00:00:47,919
and I like to call it my own are
hackerspace

10
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:51,219
are in the academic arena

11
00:00:51,219 --> 00:00:55,120
and this talk is as much

12
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:59,879
are sharing with you a project I'm
excited about as much as a plea for

13
00:00:59,879 --> 00:01:03,829
from are for involvement for
participation

14
00:01:03,829 --> 00:01:08,789
are as well are so

15
00:01:08,789 --> 00:01:13,110
I should say before I get started this
is a this is a very special year for

16
00:01:13,110 --> 00:01:14,380
cosmic rays

17
00:01:14,380 --> 00:01:18,030
arm many have you may be aware that this
is the

18
00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:23,520
the 100th anniversary year I love the
discovery of cosmic rays by Victor house

19
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:28,259
%uh Victor house originally discovered
cosmic rays

20
00:01:28,259 --> 00:01:32,110
from the the spontaneous discharging

21
00:01:32,110 --> 00:01:35,789
of Electr scopes all that were left just
sitting

22
00:01:35,789 --> 00:01:39,030
he decided air

23
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:42,470
bold experiment near the turn of the
year

24
00:01:42,470 --> 00:01:45,899
century ought to take a balloon flight

25
00:01:45,899 --> 00:01:49,880
with Electra scopes are

26
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:54,330
and measure their rate of discharge at
various altitudes and so from that he

27
00:01:54,330 --> 00:01:55,259
determined that

28
00:01:55,259 --> 00:01:59,209
to the radiation causing this discharge
was

29
00:01:59,209 --> 00:02:02,619
definitely coming from space arm

30
00:02:02,619 --> 00:02:06,250
the history is very interesting Robert
Millikan whose

31
00:02:06,250 --> 00:02:09,780
responsible for determining the charge
on the electron

32
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:13,410
are are her this order for

33
00:02:13,410 --> 00:02:16,480
created a public a public argument that
was some

34
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:19,780
documented by the new york times in fact
between

35
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:23,330
house and Millikan about what this
radiation actually was

36
00:02:23,330 --> 00:02:26,629
some on coming from space or whether
this

37
00:02:26,629 --> 00:02:30,840
discharging was a property in the air
itself so it's kind of an interesting

38
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:32,659
comparison the Historia

39
00:02:32,659 --> 00:02:37,358
you should definitely a look into it
well a hundred years serve cosmic ray

40
00:02:37,359 --> 00:02:41,750
Research has gone by we've learned a lot
about the nature of the cosmic rays but

41
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:43,200
there are some questions that

42
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:46,420
arm continue to plague

43
00:02:46,420 --> 00:02:49,499
a the community and not quite

44
00:02:49,499 --> 00:02:52,579
answered yet on as primarily in the am

45
00:02:52,579 --> 00:02:57,400
sources up the highest energy cosmic
rays

46
00:02:57,400 --> 00:03:00,499
are whether the highest energy cosmic
rays

47
00:03:00,499 --> 00:03:03,680
at the end of the unknown cosmic ray a
spectrum

48
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:07,700
are extragalactic in origin our galactic
an origin

49
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:10,930
are the most recent data

50
00:03:10,930 --> 00:03:14,319
seems to indicate that they are
extragalactic origin

51
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:18,400
are however there's still a lot of
uncertainty with regard to the actual

52
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,439
sources

53
00:03:19,439 --> 00:03:24,319
in terms of the astrophysical sources
that to are the particles are coming

54
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:24,810
from

55
00:03:24,810 --> 00:03:28,139
weather coming from active galactic
nuclei black hole

56
00:03:28,139 --> 00:03:33,290
are creation advance on neutron star
creation events associated with

57
00:03:33,290 --> 00:03:38,959
supernova and other start-up to bounce I
and possibly exotic

58
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:44,489
arm are events associated with the decay
of dark matter

59
00:03:44,489 --> 00:03:48,329
particles which the LHC may

60
00:03:48,329 --> 00:03:52,749
recently Mai Mai are sooner rather than
later

61
00:03:52,749 --> 00:03:56,230
provide us with the data for that as
they have already

62
00:03:56,230 --> 00:03:59,950
seem to have found a on

63
00:03:59,950 --> 00:04:04,359
discovered I am signals that seem to
point to the Higgs

64
00:04:04,359 --> 00:04:10,299
particle okay so the cosmic ray spectrum

65
00:04:10,299 --> 00:04:14,840
as to date are so that you can see the
cosmic ray spectrum

66
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:19,720
and this is the and I when I when I talk
about the cosmic ray spectrum I'm pretty

67
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:21,700
much going to limit the discussion to

68
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:25,630
charged or neutral particle cosmic rays
not

69
00:04:25,630 --> 00:04:30,350
gamma rays not high energy light which
of course

70
00:04:30,350 --> 00:04:34,130
I is associated with cosmic ray are
events

71
00:04:34,130 --> 00:04:37,540
and in fact gamma-ray astronomy as a

72
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:40,920
a marker art for I

73
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:46,760
for for locations in which cosmic rays
maybe being a create an accelerated

74
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:51,860
and I suppose the sources anyway %uh the
spectrum covers a broad range

75
00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:55,100
from energies

76
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:58,590
a a more than 10 orders in

77
00:04:58,590 --> 00:05:02,680
well just about one yet more than 10
orders a magnet to

78
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:06,170
odd the order of 10 orders of magnitude
in energy

79
00:05:06,170 --> 00:05:09,510
an electron volts you can see that at
the

80
00:05:09,510 --> 00:05:14,700
ankle beyond the ankle are the data
points become few and far between and

81
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:17,770
that's because those events are
extremely rare

82
00:05:17,770 --> 00:05:22,330
are they're extremely rare are

83
00:05:22,330 --> 00:05:25,789
it's not clear why they are rare

84
00:05:25,790 --> 00:05:28,950
they may be rare because the
acceleration mechanisms the

85
00:05:28,950 --> 00:05:31,840
Astrophysical acceleration mechanisms or
to peter out

86
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:35,230
at those energies or we're just not
looking

87
00:05:35,230 --> 00:05:38,390
enough are we don't have enough
observations

88
00:05:38,390 --> 00:05:43,419
to provide for om are great a large
number statistics and that's really what

89
00:05:43,420 --> 00:05:44,810
this some

90
00:05:44,810 --> 00:05:50,000
what this project on is really all about
is increasing the statistics

91
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:54,860
so the cosmic rays consists of protons
and two protons positrons electrons

92
00:05:54,860 --> 00:05:56,530
neutrinos

93
00:05:56,530 --> 00:06:00,110
re-educate reno's nuclei

94
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:04,140
and I i put a question mark on the
anti-nuclear I

95
00:06:04,140 --> 00:06:09,110
are out there is at least one experiment
that was created specifically to

96
00:06:09,110 --> 00:06:12,610
look for anti helium in the cosmic ray
spectrum

97
00:06:12,610 --> 00:06:15,640
are in that experiment is now are

98
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:19,729
installed on the International Space
Station are and its

99
00:06:19,730 --> 00:06:23,070
already taken quite a bit of data on

100
00:06:23,070 --> 00:06:27,940
all Knoll events so far for the for anti
helium

101
00:06:27,940 --> 00:06:31,670
if anti helium were discovered in the
cosmic ray spectrum or any

102
00:06:31,670 --> 00:06:35,160
anti-nuclear I were discovered in the
cosmic ray spectrum

103
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:39,440
now completely rewrite what we think we
know about the structure

104
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:44,500
the cosmos basically it would mean that
there are anti stars

105
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:48,790
are because any helium that originates
from the space environment would have to

106
00:06:48,790 --> 00:06:51,010
have been created and stars

107
00:06:51,010 --> 00:06:54,610
arm it's unlikely that that that helium
would be primordial

108
00:06:54,610 --> 00:06:58,840
helium on created Big Bang
nucleosynthesis

109
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:01,570
and so that would mean that there's a
whole region of the universe that's the

110
00:07:01,570 --> 00:07:03,400
sort of anti-matter

111
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:07,860
are separated from the the material our
universe

112
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:13,050
arm are I apologize for the anti-people
in me

113
00:07:13,050 --> 00:07:17,150
anti matter universe because to us we
are the anti-matter

114
00:07:17,150 --> 00:07:22,460
kreitzer I anyway richard fineman had a
really funny joke about that

115
00:07:22,460 --> 00:07:25,710
down about how to determine whether

116
00:07:25,710 --> 00:07:30,300
an alien that you may be communicating
with his composed of anti-matter

117
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:34,740
the anti-matter has the opposite Tom
spend angular momentum States quantum

118
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:35,380
states

119
00:07:35,380 --> 00:07:39,740
and so once you communicate with the
alien species and you agree on what is

120
00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:40,500
left and right

121
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:43,980
up and down and they come and visit you
and they come out to the spacecraft and

122
00:07:43,980 --> 00:07:47,570
if they've been raised their left hand
to shake your hand then don't don't

123
00:07:47,570 --> 00:07:48,940
touch

124
00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:55,560
I yeah

125
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:58,610
okay okay so the the Brits

126
00:07:58,610 --> 00:08:02,770
the specific cosmic rays of interest a
this particular project are so the so

127
00:08:02,770 --> 00:08:04,219
called you Packers

128
00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:08,660
the ultra high energy cosmic rays these
are the cosmic rays that exist at the

129
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:09,200
very

130
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:13,650
and a further energy spectrum be on the
ankle

131
00:08:13,650 --> 00:08:17,360
up the spectrum so the National Academy
of Sciences

132
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:21,240
are in their new worlds New Horizons arm

133
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:26,780
review which is part of the decadal
survey about for physics

134
00:08:26,780 --> 00:08:31,420
a have has indicated number important

135
00:08:31,420 --> 00:08:34,620
remaining questions for cosmic rays him

136
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:38,419
they pretty much are what are they right

137
00:08:38,419 --> 00:08:42,699
are in other words are the highest
energy cosmic rays

138
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:46,450
are they actually the particles that we
we think they are

139
00:08:46,450 --> 00:08:49,839
the normal sup nuclear particles or are
they

140
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:54,170
something else where did they come from
how are they accelerated as such I

141
00:08:54,170 --> 00:08:54,810
energies

142
00:08:54,810 --> 00:08:59,879
an are they actually indirect markers
for dark matter so in other words do the

143
00:08:59,879 --> 00:09:03,120
particle cosmic rays at the highest
energies

144
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:06,399
come from the actual DK

145
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:11,199
ourself annihilation decay the so-called
weakly interacting

146
00:09:11,199 --> 00:09:15,569
supersymmetric massive particles that
boxe should find

147
00:09:15,569 --> 00:09:18,860
very soon if they don't and actually
there's a problem because they've

148
00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:23,249
already found the headaches if indeed
they found the hearings

149
00:09:23,249 --> 00:09:27,339
so up just to highlight

150
00:09:27,339 --> 00:09:31,480
the the the review by the National
Academy

151
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:34,850
the origin a cosmic rays is still a
mystery are

152
00:09:34,850 --> 00:09:38,430
the a the the feature so far in the data

153
00:09:38,430 --> 00:09:41,569
seem to point towards an extragalactic
origin

154
00:09:41,569 --> 00:09:46,349
however more precise determination up
the degree a man I saw trippy

155
00:09:46,350 --> 00:09:50,560
are which may be possible with improved
to stick so the degree oven i such a fee

156
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:51,649
that is that they are

157
00:09:51,649 --> 00:09:58,370
they're coming from someplace in the sky
more often than other places in the sky

158
00:09:58,370 --> 00:10:02,389
okay so a little bit overview on
propagation

159
00:10:02,389 --> 00:10:05,660
about the ultra high energy cosmic rays
so the

160
00:10:05,660 --> 00:10:09,170
so the the discovery of cosmic ray
energies beyond the

161
00:10:09,170 --> 00:10:13,189
beyond a certain energy limit is
puzzling

162
00:10:13,189 --> 00:10:17,480
up because love the Jeezy k affect

163
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:21,850
so what the Jeezy care fact is that it's
this affected basically a some negative

164
00:10:21,850 --> 00:10:24,149
feedback mechanism on the energy love

165
00:10:24,149 --> 00:10:27,300
propagating cosmic rays and the universe

166
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:31,499
if a cosmic ray particles so energetic
then due to relativity

167
00:10:31,499 --> 00:10:35,889
relativistic transformation right in the
frame a particle

168
00:10:35,889 --> 00:10:40,189
been the background light love the
University look much more energetic

169
00:10:40,189 --> 00:10:43,410
right so the microwave background the
radio mic array

170
00:10:43,410 --> 00:10:48,519
visible are gamma-ray diffuse gamma-ray
and diffuse x-ray background should

171
00:10:48,519 --> 00:10:52,990
same even more energetic transformed in
relativistic Lee transformed in the

172
00:10:52,990 --> 00:10:54,110
frame

173
00:10:54,110 --> 00:10:57,230
up the hotel ultra high energy particle
and therefore

174
00:10:57,230 --> 00:11:01,540
the ultra-high energy particles being
bombarded by these extremely high energy

175
00:11:01,540 --> 00:11:05,559
photons and its frame right and so that
will

176
00:11:05,559 --> 00:11:08,579
arm are instantiated Delta

177
00:11:08,579 --> 00:11:12,740
what's called the Delta residents if the
particle is a as a

178
00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:16,029
a sub nuclear particle like up proton

179
00:11:16,029 --> 00:11:20,529
than the gamma rays are actually I am
interacting with the corks

180
00:11:20,529 --> 00:11:23,819
are and so this causes a DK

181
00:11:23,819 --> 00:11:28,139
I love the particle and so much of the
energy that is lost

182
00:11:28,139 --> 00:11:31,420
to the decay products and so you would
not expect to

183
00:11:31,420 --> 00:11:36,170
measure particle cosmic rays beyond a
certain energy because if this very

184
00:11:36,170 --> 00:11:39,378
affect

185
00:11:39,379 --> 00:11:42,860
are now art it turns out that Tom

186
00:11:42,860 --> 00:11:47,980
you can use this affect as a way to
measure distances

187
00:11:47,980 --> 00:11:53,350
right art soul if the particles are
created by sources at a certain distance

188
00:11:53,350 --> 00:11:56,430
right from the solar system from the
from the Galaxy

189
00:11:56,430 --> 00:12:00,920
or within the galaxy from the solar
system then

190
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:04,998
up then basically

191
00:12:04,999 --> 00:12:09,199
the they can only go so far before this
affects become

192
00:12:09,199 --> 00:12:14,920
before this affect becomes more probable
than less right

193
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:18,819
okay so detection and cosmetics right

194
00:12:18,819 --> 00:12:22,209
are if they're energetic enough then

195
00:12:22,209 --> 00:12:25,990
they will be weekly they will not be
deflected very much by the Galactic

196
00:12:25,990 --> 00:12:27,410
magnetic fields

197
00:12:27,410 --> 00:12:30,499
and so they will pretty much point back
to their sources

198
00:12:30,499 --> 00:12:33,980
so we can detect them and determine
where they're coming from

199
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:38,699
basically detect pgm shower front talk
about showers in a minute

200
00:12:38,699 --> 00:12:41,819
they were basically pointing towards the
astrophysical sources

201
00:12:41,819 --> 00:12:46,649
and the cosmic rays arm and again the
suppression of distant source background

202
00:12:46,649 --> 00:12:48,800
flux by the Jeezy KF Xone

203
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:54,399
sources that are be on are I think a
hundred mega parsecs were basically we

204
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:55,889
will not be able to see

205
00:12:55,889 --> 00:13:00,220
at the highest range the energy is
because the GECK effect will have

206
00:13:00,220 --> 00:13:02,850
dissipated all their energy

207
00:13:02,850 --> 00:13:06,189
which is a good thing actually for
astronomy for particle astronomy because

208
00:13:06,189 --> 00:13:07,910
then any nearby sources

209
00:13:07,910 --> 00:13:12,069
will stand out like a sore thumb

210
00:13:12,069 --> 00:13:17,309
okay so that the main way of detecting
the ultra high energy cosmic sis through

211
00:13:17,309 --> 00:13:17,639
the

212
00:13:17,639 --> 00:13:20,800
extensive air showers were actually
using the earth

213
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:24,990
are atmosphere as the part of the or
detector volume

214
00:13:24,990 --> 00:13:28,589
on it so when these are all trying to G
particles interact with the

215
00:13:28,589 --> 00:13:31,639
atmosphere are they

216
00:13:31,639 --> 00:13:37,339
a they generate a shower of secondary
particles and photons

217
00:13:37,339 --> 00:13:41,759
are and those secondaries can be
detected at the ground

218
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:45,949
by various techniques and their to sort
OVA

219
00:13:45,949 --> 00:13:50,600
apart so the shower there's the hadronic
part which is the nucleon

220
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:54,379
initiated nuclei are nucleon initiated

221
00:13:54,379 --> 00:13:57,949
and the electromagnetic which is the
gamma-ray initiated so

222
00:13:57,949 --> 00:14:01,939
for instance if you have a high energy
gamma-ray that enters the

223
00:14:01,939 --> 00:14:05,259
earth atmosphere it will essentially
generate

224
00:14:05,259 --> 00:14:08,980
electron positron pairs and more photons
electron positron fares

225
00:14:08,980 --> 00:14:12,009
for example of applying at Cascade
shower

226
00:14:12,009 --> 00:14:16,879
are however hadronic shower which is
initiated by a proton

227
00:14:16,879 --> 00:14:21,149
or a nuclear fragment like iron oxygen

228
00:14:21,149 --> 00:14:26,429
other heads the atmosphere will generate
other fragmented nuclear fragmentation

229
00:14:26,429 --> 00:14:33,429
and subatomic particle showers plus an
electromagnetic component

230
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:36,879
are and so on I'll just skip this com

231
00:14:36,879 --> 00:14:40,519
you get the point about the idea

232
00:14:40,519 --> 00:14:44,829
here is that one way to determine
whether the shower that you are

233
00:14:44,829 --> 00:14:48,769
seeing as electromagnetic initiated or
hadronic initiated as buy the

234
00:14:48,769 --> 00:14:51,920
the BRE the with the the shower so

235
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:55,879
gamma-ray generated showers to be much
narrower

236
00:14:55,879 --> 00:14:59,199
then showers generated by are

237
00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:03,329
nuclear fragments and nuclear particles
however

238
00:15:03,329 --> 00:15:06,569
once you get to the very very high and

239
00:15:06,569 --> 00:15:10,019
love the spectrum are the the

240
00:15:10,019 --> 00:15:16,209
other nucleon a showers can also be
somewhat narrow as well

241
00:15:16,209 --> 00:15:20,269
so again you need to be able to sample a
large part of the shower to really

242
00:15:20,269 --> 00:15:23,689
determine what's going on

243
00:15:23,689 --> 00:15:27,410
okay so the measurements important
measurements for air showers the energy

244
00:15:27,410 --> 00:15:28,990
obviously the spectrum

245
00:15:28,990 --> 00:15:32,329
and the arrival direction which is
important for astronomy you can't have

246
00:15:32,329 --> 00:15:35,350
any type of astronomy unless you can do

247
00:15:35,350 --> 00:15:39,959
damaging right and an optical astronomy
lenses do the imaging for you right you

248
00:15:39,959 --> 00:15:41,929
just bend the light to a focus

249
00:15:41,929 --> 00:15:46,679
and you create an image in recorded on
electronic detector or film

250
00:15:46,679 --> 00:15:51,779
although I i cant I have any I'd are
there any film cameras left I know

251
00:15:51,779 --> 00:15:55,879
arm it's all electronic mail which is
fine

252
00:15:55,879 --> 00:16:01,999
I the arrival direction and so the
techniques that many of the existing

253
00:16:01,999 --> 00:16:06,050
detection projects use

254
00:16:06,050 --> 00:16:10,290
I is some are

255
00:16:10,290 --> 00:16:14,368
either ground-based detection in
materials in which the sharp particles

256
00:16:14,369 --> 00:16:17,059
passive the materials dump energy
materials and

257
00:16:17,059 --> 00:16:21,079
that generates light that lights
detected energy is measured

258
00:16:21,079 --> 00:16:25,069
arm or you look at the atmosphere for
fluorescence

259
00:16:25,069 --> 00:16:28,980
nitrogen light from the fluorescence
nitrogen

260
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:32,259
excited by the job shower by the

261
00:16:32,259 --> 00:16:35,689
the high-energy particle shower

262
00:16:35,689 --> 00:16:39,719
sort of like a particle a sort of like a
a cosmic ray version

263
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:44,839
a high-energy cosmic ray version of the
aurora borealis

264
00:16:44,839 --> 00:16:50,769
okay so are here's a the in the in the
lower there's a depiction and what a

265
00:16:50,769 --> 00:16:54,989
what a shower might look like so the so
the Flyers I project which is now

266
00:16:54,989 --> 00:16:56,999
decommissioned

267
00:16:56,999 --> 00:17:02,170
out in Utah are looked for had both
ground-based detectors

268
00:17:02,170 --> 00:17:06,309
and and a detector that looked at
nitrogen fluorescence

269
00:17:06,309 --> 00:17:10,639
are and so it's important to have these
two different types of detection

270
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:12,470
mechanisms because

271
00:17:12,470 --> 00:17:17,530
the different detection mechanism suffer
from different systematic errors

272
00:17:17,530 --> 00:17:21,569
are and so you can use one as a check on
the other

273
00:17:21,569 --> 00:17:24,970
so the detection of the shower at the
ground

274
00:17:24,970 --> 00:17:29,690
and the view up the light that the chair
Inc of light generated

275
00:17:29,690 --> 00:17:33,000
in the atmosphere by the shower are
having

276
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:38,860
the abilities to do both for those is
important are for statistics

277
00:17:38,860 --> 00:17:42,220
okay XO again sea level simulation a
charm cough sampling

278
00:17:42,220 --> 00:17:46,440
the the the pros have that technique up

279
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:49,929
it doesn't depend on the weather or
diurnal cycle the day-night

280
00:17:49,929 --> 00:17:53,409
I the big the conserve courses that

281
00:17:53,409 --> 00:17:56,779
Tom if only the shower has to be coming
towards you in order for you to

282
00:17:56,779 --> 00:17:59,100
detective are and the

283
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:02,049
your energy determination as model
dependent because you're only sampling a

284
00:18:02,049 --> 00:18:03,360
portion of the shower

285
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:06,919
so now what you gotta do what you gotta
do Monte Carlo statistical Ste

286
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:10,870
up simulation that takes into account
all the possible particle interactions

287
00:18:10,870 --> 00:18:13,390
occur create a shower

288
00:18:13,390 --> 00:18:17,269
that gives the energy sampled by

289
00:18:17,269 --> 00:18:21,399
up your detector right

290
00:18:21,399 --> 00:18:25,250
the other way to look for these as air
fluorescence right

291
00:18:25,250 --> 00:18:28,470
other pros for that is that it's
independent particle trajectory right as

292
00:18:28,470 --> 00:18:31,789
long as you can see the atmosphere you
should be able to see the

293
00:18:31,789 --> 00:18:34,820
the light the fluorescence light right

294
00:18:34,820 --> 00:18:37,840
however you can't do this during the day

295
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:40,889
a or on former Knights

296
00:18:40,890 --> 00:18:45,059
a and its weather dependent I and many
have the

297
00:18:45,059 --> 00:18:48,549
and again much for the systematics for
air fluorescence measurements

298
00:18:48,549 --> 00:18:53,059
a deals with the um understanding how
light actually propagates in the

299
00:18:53,059 --> 00:18:55,779
atmosphere under different weather
conditions

300
00:18:55,779 --> 00:19:00,370
different atmospheric conditions

301
00:19:00,370 --> 00:19:05,340
okay what's going on here

302
00:19:05,340 --> 00:19:08,389
%ah okay so up

303
00:19:08,390 --> 00:19:11,669
I wanted to share this with you cuz it's
really cool there's a

304
00:19:11,669 --> 00:19:15,049
there's a website are called the crime a
scope

305
00:19:15,049 --> 00:19:18,580
are and what the crime a scope allows
you to do

306
00:19:18,580 --> 00:19:23,279
is it allows you to mom view the sky

307
00:19:23,279 --> 00:19:28,350
are in the different regions of the
spectrum right

308
00:19:28,350 --> 00:19:31,870
and sorta overlays right see you can
look at the gamma-ray

309
00:19:31,870 --> 00:19:35,370
right you can see most the gamma-ray
sources as determined by the

310
00:19:35,370 --> 00:19:39,440
Egret experiment on the comp in gamma
ray observatory

311
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:43,750
I am X-raying by Rosa visible by Hubble

312
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:47,779
are hydrogen

313
00:19:47,779 --> 00:19:51,529
and near-infrared by sir different
spitzer

314
00:19:51,529 --> 00:19:56,250
on the far infrared and microwave by
Kobe NW map

315
00:19:56,250 --> 00:20:00,179
and the radio right so this is really
nice but what's missing from this is the

316
00:20:00,179 --> 00:20:01,100
cosmic gramma

317
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:05,630
I'm a there's no cosmic ray map

318
00:20:05,630 --> 00:20:09,990
well develop enough well developed
enough to add to this

319
00:20:09,990 --> 00:20:15,149
dataset and so that's what I would like
to contribute to

320
00:20:15,149 --> 00:20:18,380
with arm

321
00:20:18,380 --> 00:20:22,380
this project

322
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:27,059
okay so here's the existing map up the
ultra-high energy

323
00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:30,720
cosmic rays are from

324
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:35,289
they OJ experiment located in South
America so you can see the blue

325
00:20:35,289 --> 00:20:38,940
part up is there sorta region up the sky
the vacancy

326
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:42,429
its ok so they can see what's and white
right

327
00:20:42,429 --> 00:20:46,149
which is an automatic bias right to
their data

328
00:20:46,149 --> 00:20:50,659
are and then the that the the shading
the blue shading

329
00:20:50,659 --> 00:20:54,750
tells you where they're most sensitive
to right so they're really they're very

330
00:20:54,750 --> 00:20:55,730
sensitive area

331
00:20:55,730 --> 00:20:59,970
determining the source locations a
astrophysical sources of cosmic the

332
00:20:59,970 --> 00:21:05,299
trying to cause mix is somewhat narrow
and now the circles the black circles is

333
00:21:05,299 --> 00:21:07,429
basically there are there

334
00:21:07,429 --> 00:21:10,909
calculated source location so far the
red

335
00:21:10,909 --> 00:21:14,450
a crosses are the as the catalog

336
00:21:14,450 --> 00:21:17,700
sources of gamma-ray sources

337
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:21,820
off from various other catalogues and so
there's some

338
00:21:21,820 --> 00:21:25,450
indication that for some of these in
some of these cases

339
00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:29,190
the cosmic rays are coming from the from
the gamma resources

340
00:21:29,190 --> 00:21:34,549
but not always right and with a high
degree of uncertainty

341
00:21:34,549 --> 00:21:38,470
okay so obviously for Sky exposure is
necessary

342
00:21:38,470 --> 00:21:43,139
so you can do that in two ways you can
either observance from orbit

343
00:21:43,139 --> 00:21:47,980
are and there have been a projects some

344
00:21:47,980 --> 00:21:51,659
are under consideration for doing that
in other words you're actually looking

345
00:21:51,659 --> 00:21:54,679
at the atmosphere from orbit and then
looking at the fluorescence

346
00:21:54,679 --> 00:21:58,149
about their fluorescence from cosmic
events from orbit

347
00:21:58,149 --> 00:22:01,779
or extending existing ground-based
experiments

348
00:22:01,779 --> 00:22:05,220
such as OJ will need to have in and
North

349
00:22:05,220 --> 00:22:08,260
version moja right now it's in South
America only

350
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:12,029
a North version would give it a for Sky

351
00:22:12,029 --> 00:22:15,500
view but then you know funding as always

352
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:20,700
arm iffy right and the and the National
Academy and the decadal survey did not

353
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:22,330
recommend

354
00:22:22,330 --> 00:22:27,269
are beef funding at OJ North so that
doesn't necessarily mean that OJ North

355
00:22:27,269 --> 00:22:30,539
is not going to happen but they're not
going to recommend to the president

356
00:22:30,539 --> 00:22:33,740
United States that it baar

357
00:22:33,740 --> 00:22:36,750
a science prairie

358
00:22:36,750 --> 00:22:40,169
art so to increase detection coverage
improve statistics rhyme

359
00:22:40,169 --> 00:22:44,990
sold for the flux love the cosmic rays
and energy that

360
00:22:44,990 --> 00:22:50,529
are are higher in energy than 10 to the
15 electron volts

361
00:22:50,529 --> 00:22:54,399
I your event rape

362
00:22:54,399 --> 00:22:58,269
are is about to pop by times 10 a.m. -5

363
00:22:58,269 --> 00:23:02,220
square meters per second pretty low

364
00:23:02,220 --> 00:23:05,350
right and for the flux rate for be

365
00:23:05,350 --> 00:23:10,320
ultra high-energy cosmic rays up ten the
17 electron volts

366
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:13,340
or more is even less

367
00:23:13,340 --> 00:23:17,199
five orders of magnitude less it to -10
meter/square

368
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:22,269
per meter squared second so now in order
to if you want to build a detector large

369
00:23:22,269 --> 00:23:25,580
enough for ground-based vector large
enough in our to increase your detection

370
00:23:25,580 --> 00:23:26,760
statistics to

371
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:31,639
a few events per second you need a
detector a very attended the 10

372
00:23:31,639 --> 00:23:32,880
meter/square

373
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:39,289
which is not that bad it's actually less
than half the land area of the earth

374
00:23:39,289 --> 00:23:42,350
so so that's that's a the so a

375
00:23:42,350 --> 00:23:46,159
it's not totally cloudy but clearly
exposures a challenge

376
00:23:46,159 --> 00:23:49,539
right okay so

377
00:23:49,539 --> 00:23:53,450
are what could what can you do right
well you could you could try to increase

378
00:23:53,450 --> 00:23:55,019
exposure by deploying

379
00:23:55,019 --> 00:23:58,380
are relatively inexpensive detectors
right

380
00:23:58,380 --> 00:24:01,940
so on their were a number of projects
are in fact

381
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:04,960
in your own backyard here in New York
are

382
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:09,570
at the start of the Brookhaven National
Laboratory which I collaborated with

383
00:24:09,570 --> 00:24:13,090
arm the Mariachi project the

384
00:24:13,090 --> 00:24:16,629
mixed apparatus for radar investigation
about mister cosmic rays

385
00:24:16,630 --> 00:24:20,149
high ionization a the

386
00:24:20,149 --> 00:24:24,230
Walter project the Washington large
telescope array

387
00:24:24,230 --> 00:24:28,230
are and then I'll to the North American
Large Telescope Brett cetera

388
00:24:28,230 --> 00:24:31,450
have all been sorta vertically
integrated

389
00:24:31,450 --> 00:24:35,190
arm STEM education efforts to

390
00:24:35,190 --> 00:24:39,809
do both cosmic ray astronomy and promote
STEM education

391
00:24:39,809 --> 00:24:45,509
are at the K through 12 are and the
community college level

392
00:24:45,509 --> 00:24:48,809
home however

393
00:24:48,809 --> 00:24:52,019
I kinda feel like we can do better than
that

394
00:24:52,019 --> 00:24:55,389
on it maybe I think the technology is
sorta

395
00:24:55,389 --> 00:25:00,570
arm is at the point where you should be
able to walk into a store

396
00:25:00,570 --> 00:25:05,379
and not only by a optical telescope but
also a particle telescope

397
00:25:05,380 --> 00:25:08,750
a dozen any reason to me why you should
be able to do that

398
00:25:08,750 --> 00:25:12,830
so if you gonna do that our how you
gonna do that

399
00:25:12,830 --> 00:25:17,059
alright so first thing is to use the
internet itself

400
00:25:17,059 --> 00:25:21,070
as the detector network right so the
network is the detector

401
00:25:21,070 --> 00:25:24,700
I'm so here's a map above the

402
00:25:24,700 --> 00:25:28,000
in a density of the internet right are
you guys are much more familiar with

403
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,259
this than I am

404
00:25:29,259 --> 00:25:32,480
arm so if you can imagine arm detector

405
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:36,409
if a detector had was wirelessly
internet addressable

406
00:25:36,409 --> 00:25:40,059
and could stream its data to the network

407
00:25:40,059 --> 00:25:43,379
then that date it would just be
available right for anybody who is

408
00:25:43,380 --> 00:25:44,600
interested

409
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:47,610
in detecting and individuals or were
interested in

410
00:25:47,610 --> 00:25:50,919
operating are one or more

411
00:25:50,919 --> 00:25:54,299
particle telescopes could provide that
data

412
00:25:54,299 --> 00:25:57,870
to the network as well as well as do
their own observations as well as

413
00:25:57,870 --> 00:25:58,799
coordinating

414
00:25:58,799 --> 00:26:02,289
are with other people across the
Internet to coordinate their

415
00:26:02,289 --> 00:26:05,389
observations as well

416
00:26:05,389 --> 00:26:08,679
okay so all be the requirements for for
doing something like this

417
00:26:08,679 --> 00:26:13,200
so are if it's ground-based you're
pretty much talking about protecting

418
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:17,450
a ground-based a box right the Cosmic
Cube

419
00:26:17,450 --> 00:26:22,620
a that detects showers a cosmic rays
primarily by assimilation

420
00:26:22,620 --> 00:26:27,340
you should be able to measure the energy
that with but I'm with the shower front

421
00:26:27,340 --> 00:26:31,460
are and determine the shower zenith
angle to a few degrees

422
00:26:31,460 --> 00:26:34,769
and determine the time of the event and
it should be easy to

423
00:26:34,769 --> 00:26:39,090
use right you should not have to be a he
should not have to be

424
00:26:39,090 --> 00:26:42,880
Victor house or albert Einstein to

425
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:45,940
got to use this okay

426
00:26:45,940 --> 00:26:49,600
so this was a project I love my lab

427
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:54,360
I for an inner-city that the the
principal people myself

428
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:59,730
are and Michael P Frank who's the
research engineer and technically

429
00:26:59,730 --> 00:27:04,330
on this and I had a number of students
who've come for the lab in and worked on

430
00:27:04,330 --> 00:27:05,509
this

431
00:27:05,509 --> 00:27:09,779
are from time to time I N I kinda
figured my life was a hackerspace

432
00:27:09,779 --> 00:27:11,090
because some

433
00:27:11,090 --> 00:27:15,299
I give my students quite a bit of
freedom to work on things that they're

434
00:27:15,299 --> 00:27:19,980
interested and as long as there are some
dovetailing with my interest so I'm

435
00:27:19,980 --> 00:27:21,419
extremely flexible

436
00:27:21,419 --> 00:27:25,230
and allowing that arm check a Billings
was a biochemical engineer you might

437
00:27:25,230 --> 00:27:27,799
think why as a biochemical engineer
working out Anna

438
00:27:27,799 --> 00:27:32,029
Astra particle physics laboratory so he
basically worked on

439
00:27:32,029 --> 00:27:36,889
a developing a device that used a
biological materials to detect

440
00:27:36,889 --> 00:27:41,480
light from particle radiation amounts

441
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:44,750
he's in graduate school now I'm at emory

442
00:27:44,750 --> 00:27:49,610
art so that's the cosmic II project
which was a wireless sensor network for

443
00:27:49,610 --> 00:27:51,519
exploration of cosmic rays

444
00:27:51,519 --> 00:27:54,919
high-energy cousin rare showers idea

445
00:27:54,919 --> 00:27:59,070
for the deployment was to have for
detectors

446
00:27:59,070 --> 00:28:03,000
scintillation detectors I all sort of
our

447
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:07,120
sending their information to us central
timing unit

448
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:11,039
that would determine coincidences
between the four detectors

449
00:28:11,039 --> 00:28:15,029
and determine the time be a shower

450
00:28:15,029 --> 00:28:20,279
event and send that information to us a
central PC

451
00:28:20,279 --> 00:28:23,480
and had the idea originally was to use a

452
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:28,100
optical sinking and optical sinking
mechanism so that all the clocks all the

453
00:28:28,100 --> 00:28:30,769
time in clocks on each of the detectors
would be

454
00:28:30,769 --> 00:28:34,740
are sent by a line of sight optical are

455
00:28:34,740 --> 00:28:37,960
again this was the started in my lap as
part of a

456
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:43,559
collaboration with Helio to Chi who's
the PI have the Mariachi project

457
00:28:43,559 --> 00:28:46,789
now primarily at Stony Brook

458
00:28:46,789 --> 00:28:49,830
and the nuclear science laboratory but
it started at

459
00:28:49,830 --> 00:28:54,009
Brookhaven National Laboratory Helio to
Chi as a staffer the system for Cayman

460
00:28:54,009 --> 00:28:57,350
army actually job is on the Atlas

461
00:28:57,350 --> 00:29:00,789
the LHC Atlas our detector

462
00:29:00,789 --> 00:29:03,809
com team

463
00:29:03,809 --> 00:29:06,899
okay so a node a particular node

464
00:29:06,899 --> 00:29:11,080
you've got the shower particles that
interact with the center later the

465
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:13,649
senator light is attacked by a PMT

466
00:29:13,649 --> 00:29:20,240
are the panties then gets it's possible
digitized by an fpga-based

467
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:23,580
time to digital converter are and then
that

468
00:29:23,580 --> 00:29:26,789
data sent wirelessly to the network

469
00:29:26,789 --> 00:29:30,509
or central PC or really any device that
can accept the

470
00:29:30,509 --> 00:29:33,600
the data and provide it to the network
or

471
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:37,740
are the the the detector itself

472
00:29:37,740 --> 00:29:41,559
electronics can just send the make the
data available to any

473
00:29:41,559 --> 00:29:45,740
to the network prior to 11 standard

474
00:29:45,740 --> 00:29:52,100
any device that wants to to take a look
at it

475
00:29:52,100 --> 00:29:55,320
I'm sorry say that again I came here

476
00:29:55,320 --> 00:30:00,100
photomultiplier to I'm sorry yes a PMT
means photomultiplier tube so for a much

477
00:30:00,100 --> 00:30:02,200
larger was basically an amplifier for

478
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:06,690
very very small light signals light
enters the front the PMT

479
00:30:06,690 --> 00:30:10,789
are ejects electrons from a material
called a photo cathode

480
00:30:10,789 --> 00:30:15,408
and then up those electrons hit an
electrode and then that electrodes

481
00:30:15,409 --> 00:30:18,779
a X spits out more electrons those
electrons

482
00:30:18,779 --> 00:30:22,490
had another electrode so on and so forth
the a cascade and to get a measurable

483
00:30:22,490 --> 00:30:23,059
polls

484
00:30:23,059 --> 00:30:26,490
out the back up a PMT

485
00:30:26,490 --> 00:30:30,009
okay so the wireless module that we
looked at

486
00:30:30,009 --> 00:30:33,820
I for providing the wireless
connectivity was the easy Rio

487
00:30:33,820 --> 00:30:36,960
are wireless module a

488
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:40,320
in in academic projects the funding the

489
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:45,879
the the proposal the proposal cycle and
then the funding or not funding cycle

490
00:30:45,879 --> 00:30:49,730
is so long that by the time you actually
get funded the

491
00:30:49,730 --> 00:30:52,919
the technology propose the use is
probably already obsolete

492
00:30:52,919 --> 00:30:57,399
right so this probably much better
wireless technologies that

493
00:30:57,399 --> 00:31:00,909
should be used for this now alright so
if we do this

494
00:31:00,909 --> 00:31:04,860
again unfortunately and asserted not
renew our funding

495
00:31:04,860 --> 00:31:09,149
arm so we're looking elsewhere are

496
00:31:09,149 --> 00:31:12,200
we probably should look at a

497
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:16,059
a what is now considered really really
good state-of-the-art

498
00:31:16,059 --> 00:31:19,320
down but cheap wireless modules

499
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:22,428
arm so

500
00:31:22,429 --> 00:31:26,480
the important thing for the science
right as the poor shape reconstruction

501
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:30,080
so in the shape for the post it turns
out that different particles interact

502
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:32,320
differently with the simulation material

503
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:35,360
right and so the shaper the polls will
tell you something about the type

504
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:38,169
article that interacted with the a

505
00:31:38,169 --> 00:31:41,730
with the settler material it's also
important that the

506
00:31:41,730 --> 00:31:45,499
electronics be able to provide a poor
shape

507
00:31:45,499 --> 00:31:49,509
reconstruction mechanism that can be
done offline after you pull the

508
00:31:49,509 --> 00:31:52,929
um if you pull the data off or

509
00:31:52,929 --> 00:31:57,929
it can be done on in the hardware right
on the fpga-based front and

510
00:31:57,929 --> 00:32:01,139
digitisation whether see fed a man's
front

511
00:32:01,139 --> 00:32:05,769
an I digital acquisition module

512
00:32:05,769 --> 00:32:09,159
yeah okay that's so my engineers told me
to say okay

513
00:32:09,159 --> 00:32:12,249
yeah everybody's familiar with wanna

514
00:32:12,249 --> 00:32:15,889
FPGA as you guys should be more from
earlier than I am with FPGA is

515
00:32:15,889 --> 00:32:19,009
now okay

516
00:32:19,009 --> 00:32:22,389
arm so the digital front and for this

517
00:32:22,389 --> 00:32:26,809
is is a new is somewhat new because the
traditional way a bit

518
00:32:26,809 --> 00:32:30,519
love processing are nuclear pulse data

519
00:32:30,519 --> 00:32:33,879
right from nuclear detectors radiation
detectors in general

520
00:32:33,879 --> 00:32:37,749
is to have an analog front and that then
gets digitize through

521
00:32:37,749 --> 00:32:43,299
a/d converters and then you can do
offline analysis on your computer

522
00:32:43,299 --> 00:32:47,070
after you for taken the digital data of

523
00:32:47,070 --> 00:32:51,580
but the the nice thing about doing this
and a fully digital implementation on

524
00:32:51,580 --> 00:32:54,899
FPGA as you can do everything on the
board in the front and you can provide

525
00:32:54,899 --> 00:32:59,559
some analysis and even some filtering
events right there on the front lawn

526
00:32:59,559 --> 00:33:03,389
are and so that that provides some
flexibility

527
00:33:03,389 --> 00:33:06,460
are love up %uh observation

528
00:33:06,460 --> 00:33:12,259
in terms the kinds of cosmic-ray events
you might want to look for

529
00:33:12,259 --> 00:33:16,169
okay so we we um presented

530
00:33:16,169 --> 00:33:19,330
a a poster on the board

531
00:33:19,330 --> 00:33:22,940
that we developed with brooke haven for
this

532
00:33:22,940 --> 00:33:26,450
I and the board

533
00:33:26,450 --> 00:33:30,409
basically the so yeah produces a cursor

534
00:33:30,409 --> 00:33:33,429
so basically here the signal inputs

535
00:33:33,429 --> 00:33:37,990
alright here's the FPGA chip which is
shown with thermal paste

536
00:33:37,990 --> 00:33:41,529
are we sort or borrowed a technique from
the

537
00:33:41,529 --> 00:33:45,909
gaming community right we wanted to run
the FPGA faster than

538
00:33:45,909 --> 00:33:49,740
it really should be run are so we
overclocked it

539
00:33:49,740 --> 00:33:54,490
right but we had to cool it right as it
gets hot and again that's because

540
00:33:54,490 --> 00:33:59,340
proposal cycle funding are out there are
much better FPGA said exist now

541
00:33:59,340 --> 00:34:02,429
if we redesigned the board with a
current

542
00:34:02,429 --> 00:34:06,929
FPGA we probably wouldn't have this
problem the FPGA that this was based on

543
00:34:06,929 --> 00:34:08,909
what the Stratix to

544
00:34:08,909 --> 00:34:12,159
are which is the Altera Stratix to which
we got for free

545
00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:15,929
from Altera so that's why we use it

546
00:34:15,929 --> 00:34:19,889
so big ups to Alterra

547
00:34:19,889 --> 00:34:23,250
they're not going to give us any more
for free but thats

548
00:34:23,250 --> 00:34:26,440
now we got one so okay

549
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:30,290
shows Michael last stop stop

550
00:34:30,290 --> 00:34:33,509
garth doing and year

551
00:34:33,510 --> 00:34:37,399
our match digitizer were input where
we're using an issue with it

552
00:34:37,399 --> 00:34:40,509
ties okay wheels starr's office over

553
00:34:40,510 --> 00:34:43,940
starter and this is so

554
00:34:43,940 --> 00:34:47,210
so basically we've posted all of our
video going

555
00:34:47,210 --> 00:34:50,449
videos evolve our tests are Electronix
on your to

556
00:34:50,449 --> 00:34:54,480
on our YouTube channel using it to so if
you go to YouTube when you search a PCR

557
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:55,520
Dr TL

558
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:59,900
first are you can check out our tests
and that you can make comments about how

559
00:34:59,900 --> 00:35:03,670
you're doing it wrong or Capital Radio
him I'm gonna do it this way

560
00:35:03,670 --> 00:35:07,920
I'll Beach or I don't understand how
this electronics works what was going on

561
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:08,309
our

562
00:35:08,309 --> 00:35:12,750
on the screen as the signal from

563
00:35:12,750 --> 00:35:17,400
books alone this Michael Franks

564
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:21,319
country the correct process

565
00:35:21,319 --> 00:35:26,119
sorry about that I C okay so I i just
included the videos because there's a

566
00:35:26,119 --> 00:35:29,170
just to show you so that's what that's
what a pulse

567
00:35:29,170 --> 00:35:32,790
actually looks like right I from the

568
00:35:32,790 --> 00:35:35,859
detector output and here

569
00:35:35,859 --> 00:35:39,660
basically is the is the digital

570
00:35:39,660 --> 00:35:43,308
is essentially the the digital
information allows us to encode the

571
00:35:43,309 --> 00:35:46,859
um level crossing to the polls so the
way we

572
00:35:46,859 --> 00:35:50,009
the way we to implement the digital

573
00:35:50,010 --> 00:35:53,950
the digital arm post processing using
FPGA

574
00:35:53,950 --> 00:35:57,308
is that basically the FPGA measures the
time that

575
00:35:57,309 --> 00:36:00,900
the our poll spends over various

576
00:36:00,900 --> 00:36:04,670
voltage thresholds so again the nice
thing about doing this in a digital

577
00:36:04,670 --> 00:36:06,030
reconfigurable

578
00:36:06,030 --> 00:36:09,780
up computing paradigm

579
00:36:09,780 --> 00:36:13,450
is that you can alter the you can alter
the debt levels

580
00:36:13,450 --> 00:36:16,629
right and then you can also

581
00:36:16,630 --> 00:36:20,680
and so you can also I do the potion a
pre-construction

582
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:24,200
right on the chip

583
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:27,760
okay so now the idea the cosmic you

584
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:33,200
the sort of single detector node are is
a is a commercial evolution up the

585
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:34,220
cosmic I

586
00:36:34,220 --> 00:36:37,480
right so the idea is that the cosmic you
detects

587
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:42,140
it sends its information two devices
whether that device is a PC with other

588
00:36:42,140 --> 00:36:42,910
devices a

589
00:36:42,910 --> 00:36:46,089
tablet device or up iPhone

590
00:36:46,089 --> 00:36:49,130
are and in the cloud exists

591
00:36:49,130 --> 00:36:52,390
analysis software and other data
services for

592
00:36:52,390 --> 00:36:56,700
for analyzing the data right however all
of the detection data

593
00:36:56,700 --> 00:37:00,670
just eg exists on the PC nodes

594
00:37:00,670 --> 00:37:04,480
in a in a peer to peer like network I
was at another talk here and somebody

595
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:06,410
claim that peer to peer was going away

596
00:37:06,410 --> 00:37:09,990
am and I hope that's the case but maybe
the the whole model for this is a make

597
00:37:09,990 --> 00:37:10,550
any sense

598
00:37:10,550 --> 00:37:16,160
that's a if that's the case

599
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:19,240
okay so the Cosmic Cube features

600
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:22,980
Wireless standard data streaming two
devices

601
00:37:22,980 --> 00:37:28,329
are the cloud are edge uses GPS standard
an able so each relation it

602
00:37:28,329 --> 00:37:31,670
protectionist time and location stamp
are

603
00:37:31,670 --> 00:37:36,069
the the electronics that we already
developed for cosmic I would be sorta

604
00:37:36,069 --> 00:37:41,220
there be a version developed for the Q
are for real time analysis

605
00:37:41,220 --> 00:37:45,240
art which would include some radiation
species discrimination

606
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:51,410
arm and the community abusers right the
idea again another plus

607
00:37:51,410 --> 00:37:55,460
up basing the digitisation up the signal
pulses

608
00:37:55,460 --> 00:38:00,800
on reconfigurable computing is to allow
the users the ability to go into that PJ

609
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:01,200
and

610
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:05,849
alter the jail where right that the
hardware/software

611
00:38:05,849 --> 00:38:09,420
definition are to their interest

612
00:38:09,420 --> 00:38:13,410
or to their liking are and so the idea
is to allow the crowd

613
00:38:13,410 --> 00:38:18,879
right to determine arm the best way to
look for

614
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:24,099
are various kinds of cosmic-ray signals
I'm

615
00:38:24,099 --> 00:38:27,220
so now what's the price target for
something like this so if you look at

616
00:38:27,220 --> 00:38:28,339
the high and

617
00:38:28,339 --> 00:38:32,680
Pro Am telescopes optical telescopes
they can

618
00:38:32,680 --> 00:38:36,980
cost up as much as twenty thousand
dollars or more

619
00:38:36,980 --> 00:38:40,720
primarily due to the optics right arm

620
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:44,010
we have a we have a new telescope at the
university has been installing

621
00:38:44,010 --> 00:38:44,920
Observatory a

622
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:49,410
but Tom the vendor basically had be the
mirror

623
00:38:49,410 --> 00:38:52,450
atomically milled in Russia right

624
00:38:52,450 --> 00:38:57,200
at a facility that have been arm after
the into the cold war right this

625
00:38:57,200 --> 00:39:01,109
this russian facility had to find a use
for itself and you know you guys may

626
00:39:01,109 --> 00:39:02,890
have heard the stories /a

627
00:39:02,890 --> 00:39:06,549
you know Russian factories that were
spitting out tanks

628
00:39:06,550 --> 00:39:09,599
and airplanes and and fighter

629
00:39:09,599 --> 00:39:13,089
craft are now making like pressure
cookers

630
00:39:13,089 --> 00:39:16,470
a titanium are and

631
00:39:16,470 --> 00:39:21,160
you know this particular facility had to
find a use for its atomic milling

632
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:25,529
are and so now its under contract right
you can just pay them to

633
00:39:25,530 --> 00:39:28,559
atomically Milan optical surface to

634
00:39:28,559 --> 00:39:31,880
to extreme some extra mile

635
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:37,589
figure resolution flat-panel TVs PCs
right two thousand dollars or less

636
00:39:37,589 --> 00:39:41,470
all based on commodity electronics the
cosmic you

637
00:39:41,470 --> 00:39:45,200
has some will have some optics and some
electro-optics but

638
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:48,839
but mostly commodity electronics and
some special materials

639
00:39:48,839 --> 00:39:52,180
for instance arm if you're going to do
um

640
00:39:52,180 --> 00:39:55,319
if you're going to determine the
difference between electrons and nuclei

641
00:39:55,319 --> 00:39:59,329
runs right the easiest way to do this
through calorimetry where you force

642
00:39:59,329 --> 00:40:03,890
the arm where you force the gamma rays

643
00:40:03,890 --> 00:40:07,359
or the electrons in the electromagnetic
part in the shower

644
00:40:07,359 --> 00:40:11,400
to convert and led or depleted uranium
no I don't think we're gonna get a pass

645
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:11,900
from me

646
00:40:11,900 --> 00:40:16,270
FDA on putting depleted uranium in a
consumer device

647
00:40:16,270 --> 00:40:20,880
are but we might be able to put lead and
as long as the lead is fully encased

648
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:24,589
are in a a a park Si and some kind of a
pox is so that sealed

649
00:40:24,589 --> 00:40:28,819
right as fully seal are but we'll have
to see

650
00:40:28,819 --> 00:40:32,240
are so who would want to who would want
a cosmic you right

651
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:36,859
so we think the same people that you
know are already into amateur astronomy

652
00:40:36,859 --> 00:40:41,069
I'll and are science and technology
enthusiasts folks in this crowd for

653
00:40:41,069 --> 00:40:43,029
instance might want one

654
00:40:43,030 --> 00:40:47,710
arm are because you know a

655
00:40:47,710 --> 00:40:50,770
possibly contributing to science

656
00:40:50,770 --> 00:40:55,079
is an exciting thing and there's some
precedent for this an astronomy

657
00:40:55,079 --> 00:40:58,890
particularly in astronomy for so-called
amatures right

658
00:40:58,890 --> 00:41:02,140
I mean this guy was an amateur run
Darwin

659
00:41:02,140 --> 00:41:05,629
it could be even argue that Einstein was
an amateur when he developed a theory of

660
00:41:05,630 --> 00:41:06,680
relativity

661
00:41:06,680 --> 00:41:10,549
and David loving right %uh levy
shoemaker 9 that discovered the

662
00:41:10,549 --> 00:41:15,140
comment that slammed into jupiter is
amateur is not a professional astronomer

663
00:41:15,140 --> 00:41:18,140
I'll this fellow whose name I

664
00:41:18,140 --> 00:41:22,500
I forget I tiny

665
00:41:22,500 --> 00:41:26,200
I don't remember his last name forgive
me but Tom

666
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:30,200
he's not a professional astronomer and
he's discovered two XO planets

667
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:34,950
right are so he was on a bitterly
discovers professional or amateur

668
00:41:34,950 --> 00:41:40,040
love planets orbiting other stars arm so
there's a great tradition

669
00:41:40,040 --> 00:41:43,308
right and astronomy is it's there seems
to me know

670
00:41:43,309 --> 00:41:47,780
reason why this can't be true and
particle astronomy once the technology

671
00:41:47,780 --> 00:41:49,950
is made available to

672
00:41:49,950 --> 00:41:53,160
to users okay so

673
00:41:53,160 --> 00:41:56,149
in the development a cosmic you
basically what would you get you would

674
00:41:56,150 --> 00:41:57,700
basically get

675
00:41:57,700 --> 00:42:02,109
are a box right which contains the
detector material volume

676
00:42:02,109 --> 00:42:05,940
arm the I'll the

677
00:42:05,940 --> 00:42:10,250
and then the be electronics box right
which contains the front and it is a

678
00:42:10,250 --> 00:42:11,089
shin module

679
00:42:11,089 --> 00:42:14,650
fpga-based some power electronics

680
00:42:14,650 --> 00:42:18,230
which you either could plug into the
wall or you could powered by solar if

681
00:42:18,230 --> 00:42:20,730
you want to put your module outside

682
00:42:20,730 --> 00:42:25,240
arm and there's useful science and and
putting the module outside versus and

683
00:42:25,240 --> 00:42:28,089
site for instance if you put your model
outside

684
00:42:28,089 --> 00:42:32,599
are then you're going to be saying more
of the electrons in the shower whether a

685
00:42:32,599 --> 00:42:36,910
as you put your module inside are then
you're pretty much only gonna see them

686
00:42:36,910 --> 00:42:40,089
you on component in the shower because
the electrons will be absorbed by the

687
00:42:40,089 --> 00:42:41,890
building structure

688
00:42:41,890 --> 00:42:44,970
are and then of course GPS and so the
software

689
00:42:44,970 --> 00:42:48,069
all based on open-source and the

690
00:42:48,069 --> 00:42:53,950
at least be our software allowing you to
alter the functionality of the FPGA

691
00:42:53,950 --> 00:42:55,760
would be available to you as well

692
00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:59,069
right the only thing you would not be
able to open is the

693
00:42:59,069 --> 00:43:02,819
detector materials volume the box which
actually contains

694
00:43:02,819 --> 00:43:05,980
the stuff art which the particles in the
shower

695
00:43:05,980 --> 00:43:09,329
convert to that converts the particles
in the energy the party was the shower

696
00:43:09,329 --> 00:43:10,190
to light

697
00:43:10,190 --> 00:43:14,390
I'm particularly if that's going to
contain lead or

698
00:43:14,390 --> 00:43:19,069
depleted uranium okay for the
duplication have the

699
00:43:19,069 --> 00:43:22,890
front-end electronics were looking at
are you know various companies that will

700
00:43:22,890 --> 00:43:25,259
do this cheaply like Sunstone

701
00:43:25,260 --> 00:43:28,690
arm I we're open to suggestion on this

702
00:43:28,690 --> 00:43:33,000
a stir the best way to pursue this
whether the electronics

703
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:36,809
development duplication should be done
in an open source

704
00:43:36,809 --> 00:43:40,770
mode at the hardware level or at what at
what level

705
00:43:40,770 --> 00:43:45,720
open source should be in the hardware at
least in part the hardware

706
00:43:45,720 --> 00:43:50,760
I don't think we really don't have a
good idea are as to how to do that

707
00:43:50,760 --> 00:43:56,030
are we started a arm a cosmic you
project page in Facebook

708
00:43:56,030 --> 00:44:00,790
are I know that there have been some
other arm some other social media

709
00:44:00,790 --> 00:44:05,599
arm directions talked about at this
conference that are anti Facebook

710
00:44:05,599 --> 00:44:10,510
we will we're open to putting a cosmic
you project on such

711
00:44:10,510 --> 00:44:14,589
as well are if Facebook is sorta dying

712
00:44:14,589 --> 00:44:17,950
we don't wanna we don't wanna serves

713
00:44:17,950 --> 00:44:23,790
source ass for participation and dying
platform

714
00:44:23,790 --> 00:44:27,099
we also have a survey I'll which

715
00:44:27,099 --> 00:44:30,109
a is trying to gauge the interest of the
public

716
00:44:30,109 --> 00:44:34,230
and participating in particle astronomy
on and

717
00:44:34,230 --> 00:44:37,790
we would like you to go to the survey
and fill out the survey if you have a

718
00:44:37,790 --> 00:44:38,808
chance

719
00:44:38,809 --> 00:44:41,950
are none other questions are arm

720
00:44:41,950 --> 00:44:45,270
it's a Google Documents survey creating
Google Documents its

721
00:44:45,270 --> 00:44:48,839
now the questions are required right you
not required to answer any questions

722
00:44:48,839 --> 00:44:50,130
sorry but

723
00:44:50,130 --> 00:44:53,619
we would like to at least know what the
release try to gauge the

724
00:44:53,619 --> 00:44:57,380
the general interest I and participating
in something like this

725
00:44:57,380 --> 00:45:01,880
is so there's the web page the URL for
the website

726
00:45:01,880 --> 00:45:07,180
y da tell why slash BP eight

727
00:45:07,180 --> 00:45:10,520
okay are now the the sourdough

728
00:45:10,520 --> 00:45:13,859
the the IT addendum to the talk so

729
00:45:13,859 --> 00:45:17,700
I'm I'm a physicist I'm not on a
computer scientist so

730
00:45:17,700 --> 00:45:20,710
you guys know more about this than I do

731
00:45:20,710 --> 00:45:24,099
arm and and the forgive me if I

732
00:45:24,099 --> 00:45:27,770
if I relate anything insultingly obvious

733
00:45:27,770 --> 00:45:31,559
to you arm but the other possibility
that's a yr

734
00:45:31,559 --> 00:45:34,940
you're not interested in just using the
box for cosmic you

735
00:45:34,940 --> 00:45:39,299
resin astronomy device what else could
you potentially use it for a while

736
00:45:39,299 --> 00:45:43,280
you could use it to generate random bits
for cryptographic

737
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:46,880
for instance are in fact arm

738
00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:49,910
the entire network right abusers

739
00:45:49,910 --> 00:45:54,160
up these things could form a and
encryption network right a

740
00:45:54,160 --> 00:45:58,170
cue generation network or random bit
generation network

741
00:45:58,170 --> 00:46:01,460
up true randoms am I am

742
00:46:01,460 --> 00:46:06,000
okay I've got two minutes left okay very
good

743
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:09,799
alright so so their number a veranda
features a concentrated texan events

744
00:46:09,799 --> 00:46:10,680
right that you might

745
00:46:10,680 --> 00:46:14,250
used to generate random bits so for
instance you could use the

746
00:46:14,250 --> 00:46:17,260
are that the actual time at which the
first threshold

747
00:46:17,260 --> 00:46:21,579
first voltage threshold is crossed by
the polls art during a detection

748
00:46:21,579 --> 00:46:25,890
or the be calculated post centroid time
right which is obviously related to the

749
00:46:25,890 --> 00:46:27,069
first voltage

750
00:46:27,069 --> 00:46:31,619
crossing time the counts per bene as
long as you create the right Ben Wright

751
00:46:31,619 --> 00:46:32,450
the counts

752
00:46:32,450 --> 00:46:35,780
for temporal been observing cousin
Ravens during the day

753
00:46:35,780 --> 00:46:39,849
during the week month years arm should
be random

754
00:46:39,849 --> 00:46:44,819
I'll the I folder J fold coincidences if
you happen to operate

755
00:46:44,819 --> 00:46:49,480
a number of detectors right all tied
into a single electronics box

756
00:46:49,480 --> 00:46:52,980
because you want your own many telescope
arm

757
00:46:52,980 --> 00:46:56,140
to do triangulation on source direction

758
00:46:56,140 --> 00:47:01,058
are then than the pulses that are not
coincidence pulses were suppose is that

759
00:47:01,059 --> 00:47:03,720
a coincidence a certain number of
coincidences

760
00:47:03,720 --> 00:47:06,750
should also be random write you can be
given a number other

761
00:47:06,750 --> 00:47:10,829
a things to pull that you can pull up
the data that would be

762
00:47:10,829 --> 00:47:14,369
that would be random that might be
usable for key generation

763
00:47:14,369 --> 00:47:17,660
for cryptographic key generation okay so

764
00:47:17,660 --> 00:47:21,509
are the the detector network would
essentially create a network random

765
00:47:21,510 --> 00:47:23,069
number generator

766
00:47:23,069 --> 00:47:26,930
are and I you could randomly

767
00:47:26,930 --> 00:47:29,950
sample but could be software tools made
by the

768
00:47:29,950 --> 00:47:34,410
community abusers to randomly sampled
data

769
00:47:34,410 --> 00:47:38,828
in the network nodes to provide a
another layer randomness right

770
00:47:38,829 --> 00:47:43,089
and that could be used for cryptographic
you generation are following the

771
00:47:43,089 --> 00:47:48,920
um the recommendations such as the
recommendations made last year by missed

772
00:47:48,920 --> 00:47:52,319
are and with that I'm discuss

773
00:47:52,319 --> 00:47:57,079
give a shout out to the funding that
we've had but the funding is going away

774
00:47:57,079 --> 00:48:00,630
ike right in tall

775
00:48:00,630 --> 00:48:05,000
and Alterra our license so we're
