1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,619
because he's not was broken solution but
he has something called for you

2
00:00:03,620 --> 00:00:07,220
and considering how many people in this
room has into neighboring Chile special

3
00:00:07,220 --> 00:00:10,860
his restaurant for this room but not
necessarily police

4
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:13,989
is computer forensics possible the

5
00:00:13,990 --> 00:00:17,240
primarily upon which is owned by jail

6
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:20,380
%um have

7
00:00:20,380 --> 00:00:24,029
wax

8
00:00:24,029 --> 00:00:27,300
governorship in fact

9
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:31,170
surprised me but I'm not consume people
are not

10
00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:35,410
and then as I i'm joe says possibly when
opening in fact

11
00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:38,899
computer programs like fred has happened
to my downer

12
00:00:38,899 --> 00:00:42,640
but some meet this growing
seamlesstabbing

13
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:46,940
I am NOT a mere I'm not I'm he bears are
saying

14
00:00:46,940 --> 00:00:51,230
don't brag I'm not sure but I'm not
gonna I work for learners

15
00:00:51,230 --> 00:00:55,460
but I'm not one and one of the things I
cover in my classroom

16
00:00:55,460 --> 00:00:58,949
is words and punctuation

17
00:00:58,949 --> 00:01:02,739
mean things and those are you remember

18
00:01:02,739 --> 00:01:05,100
job it was def Khan

19
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:10,130
my thing was 16 I'm the MBTA versus the
MIT students

20
00:01:10,130 --> 00:01:13,949
the Massachusetts Bay Transit Authority
some MIT students figured out

21
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:19,390
how to ride for free they didn't break
the lab they just figured out how to do

22
00:01:19,390 --> 00:01:19,680
it

23
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:24,060
and their talk was squashed it was
stopped at Def Con

24
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:28,360
and they ended up in a lawsuit and that
lawsuit was decided

25
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:31,869
partially on the placement Obama

26
00:01:31,869 --> 00:01:35,610
in a sentence and it reads below them in
the back we can see it first

27
00:01:35,610 --> 00:01:39,670
taxed in the section indicates by the
placement of a comma before the clause

28
00:01:39,670 --> 00:01:40,240
to be

29
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:43,810
a protected computer that the offender
must both transmit information to the

30
00:01:43,810 --> 00:01:44,800
protected computer

31
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:49,000
and cause damage to that same computer
so what are the things I like to bring

32
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,990
up my skin says I'm not aware

33
00:01:50,990 --> 00:01:54,750
you're not aware pressure out there

34
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:58,700
you know there you can read the law and
understand it

35
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:03,130
that's the lawyers and judges hike

36
00:02:03,130 --> 00:02:08,119
my disclaimer continuance because I work
for apology prior the code of conduct

37
00:02:08,119 --> 00:02:11,500
policies in place should clearly
identify their opinions as personal

38
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:16,940
and not be happy to college cell those
expressed in this presentation are so in

39
00:02:16,940 --> 00:02:17,660
order to prevent

40
00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:22,290
do not necessarily reflect those of my
employer I home

41
00:02:22,290 --> 00:02:25,320
everything going on in bad moods where
is the condition if they know what is

42
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:27,560
expressed implied blah blah blah blah
blah

43
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:32,130
I now are not compatible with all the
disclaimers tight the schedule normally

44
00:02:32,130 --> 00:02:35,700
I don't like to talk about me I like the
right into whatever my research is what

45
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:36,850
i'm talking about. but

46
00:02:36,850 --> 00:02:40,079
it has a lot to do with the computer
forensics

47
00:02:40,079 --> 00:02:43,459
but I'm doing on the defense side so I'm
a little bit to talk about me

48
00:02:43,459 --> 00:02:47,239
number talk about accidental downloads
two years ago I hope

49
00:02:47,239 --> 00:02:50,910
I at 9:30 on Sunday morning

50
00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:55,370
I'm really happy with the turnout here
I'm not where I want to be like 930 on

51
00:02:55,370 --> 00:02:56,299
Sunday morning

52
00:02:56,299 --> 00:02:59,410
I'm I did talk

53
00:02:59,410 --> 00:03:03,420
about the need for a computer crime
Innocence Project

54
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:08,410
and not the help committee now want me
talking or they didn't know me they

55
00:03:08,410 --> 00:03:11,780
didn't know how I speak they didn't know
my background and they said well have

56
00:03:11,780 --> 00:03:13,720
you come in talk but we want to have

57
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:19,220
on attorney and possibly some other
panelists on the panel with you

58
00:03:19,220 --> 00:03:22,780
so they contacted the ya the

59
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:26,479
computer occur now the computer kinda
the Innocence Project

60
00:03:26,479 --> 00:03:30,430
at I think it's cardoza University its
new york

61
00:03:30,430 --> 00:03:33,590
University and said we have this guy
coming in to present

62
00:03:33,590 --> 00:03:37,019
on on the need for a computer crime
Innocence Project

63
00:03:37,019 --> 00:03:41,170
would you be interested in presenting
with him

64
00:03:41,170 --> 00:03:43,730
but some other cases will be talking
about RCP

65
00:03:43,730 --> 00:03:47,170
child pornography no we're not
interested at all

66
00:03:47,170 --> 00:03:51,100
so the plan murderers who are not guilty

67
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:54,280
but they apparently want the pen people
who had

68
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:57,740
wanna being prosecuted for child
pornography

69
00:03:57,740 --> 00:04:02,000
but are not guilty at least that's what
I was told it's too controversial

70
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,550
on the subject so well in tandem with a
lot of that talk had to deal with now

71
00:04:06,550 --> 00:04:08,930
where downloading illegal content.

72
00:04:08,930 --> 00:04:14,070
Ste today he I'm gonna be talking about
accidental ballots how easy it is

73
00:04:14,070 --> 00:04:18,290
for someone who's not really computer
savvy or maybe slightly computer savvy

74
00:04:18,290 --> 00:04:22,480
to end up with illegal content on your
drive and they did not know it was there

75
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:26,000
are not real quick scenario-based
exercise

76
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,640
nothing in computer forensics is quick
so turnout

77
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:32,760
fifty-five minutes to talk now probably
about 45 minutes

78
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:36,120
to talk I'm not gonna have a whole lotta
time to go into detail

79
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:40,890
everything I'm talking about is a basic
computer not a hope attendees computer

80
00:04:40,890 --> 00:04:44,590
I it's a general public's computer I'll
go through that

81
00:04:44,590 --> 00:04:48,330
and you get to see an idea what I go
through when I do a friend began

82
00:04:48,330 --> 00:04:53,810
on I examination and what students in my
classroom go through when they happen to

83
00:04:53,810 --> 00:04:56,710
our printer examination I teach a
computer forensics courts

84
00:04:56,710 --> 00:05:00,020
it's a one-hour lecture and a four hour
lab

85
00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:04,130
and I've had students dropped the class
because it's too boring

86
00:05:04,130 --> 00:05:07,180
four hours allowed what do you think
this is

87
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:10,280
CSI Miami doesn't happen in an hour

88
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:13,590
wanna talk about the cross the defense
so should you get

89
00:05:13,590 --> 00:05:17,710
are prosecuted for a crime he didn't
commit or

90
00:05:17,710 --> 00:05:21,820
when I like to say you're a little
guilty how much is that gonna cost you

91
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:25,659
and especially when you're talking about
CPU my tear was a little guilty that you

92
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:27,169
get an idea that when we're done

93
00:05:27,169 --> 00:05:31,370
and then I should have some some time
for questions comments and contacts on

94
00:05:31,370 --> 00:05:34,780
ok a little bit about my background

95
00:05:34,780 --> 00:05:39,560
I'm a network specialist instructor for
Northeast Wisconsin Technical College in

96
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:40,880
Green Bay Wisconsin

97
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:44,560
I primarily teach Linux network security
in computer forensics

98
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:48,150
many times people see that may say only
teaches Linux

99
00:05:48,150 --> 00:05:53,250
you must not know anything about Windows
the computer forensics courses all

100
00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:57,620
Windows based all we're doing is an rise
in computer is analyzing window systems

101
00:05:57,620 --> 00:05:59,140
but we're using a linux-based

102
00:05:59,140 --> 00:06:03,430
forensic want I the network security
classes all

103
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:07,710
looking at the security of windows-based
systems the Linux system is a Linux or

104
00:06:07,710 --> 00:06:08,630
Linux class

105
00:06:08,630 --> 00:06:11,800
is a Linux server class that we have

106
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:15,789
Windows clients so I know plenty about
Windows I'm

107
00:06:15,789 --> 00:06:20,240
I've had positions covering every aspect
of computers including help desk support

108
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:23,240
technician program a network
administrator director of technology

109
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:27,080
computer security incident with response
team member in computer forensic

110
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:27,789
examiner

111
00:06:27,789 --> 00:06:32,530
why do I go through that well I think
the top ones which many have you might

112
00:06:32,530 --> 00:06:35,220
be at that position your career help
desk support

113
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:38,930
technician programmer really help me
understand

114
00:06:38,930 --> 00:06:42,260
what normal users do when it comes

115
00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:47,070
Ted using their computer a lot of times
when I'm sitting down with an attorney

116
00:06:47,070 --> 00:06:50,690
and I'm explaining how something
happened its

117
00:06:50,690 --> 00:06:53,919
you have to understand that this person
didn't know what was going on here any

118
00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:55,240
average user

119
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:58,450
they don't know what happened what's
going on a computer so certain things

120
00:06:58,450 --> 00:06:59,110
are possible

121
00:06:59,110 --> 00:07:02,900
I'm a former United States Marine my
last duty station was with special

122
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:04,080
operations training group

123
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:07,870
tactical warfare simulations evaluations
analysis systems

124
00:07:07,870 --> 00:07:12,979
where I got my start with computers
windows three one and a UNIX server

125
00:07:12,979 --> 00:07:16,810
an outspoken nationally adept on hope
the last hope

126
00:07:16,810 --> 00:07:20,140
what was the next pope and personal open

127
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:24,110
and the UAB conference in some hike

128
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:27,460
how did I get started from a criminal
last standpoint

129
00:07:27,460 --> 00:07:31,810
well well I know you can't teach long
enough you have a lot of students and

130
00:07:31,810 --> 00:07:32,880
one of my students

131
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:36,180
was the network specialist for a law
firm

132
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:39,190
and now law firm ended up with RCP case

133
00:07:39,190 --> 00:07:42,479
Chapman case and the lawyer told

134
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:47,620
the best student Brian OIII worked with
the top Armada Milwaukee

135
00:07:47,620 --> 00:07:52,120
but the case went from one examiner to
another examiner never got enough

136
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:54,150
information it was very expensive

137
00:07:54,150 --> 00:07:57,840
I don't know you know did I don't know
if I wanna do that maybe you could help

138
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:58,919
me to student

139
00:07:58,919 --> 00:08:04,049
and since a July I bet I can help you
and they got a copy to drive at the time

140
00:08:04,050 --> 00:08:07,479
you could get the drive you can't do
that anymore I had the time to get a

141
00:08:07,479 --> 00:08:08,900
copy the driving of course

142
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:13,240
he hooked up to a computer and started
looking at it and all the forensic

143
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:16,860
paper all upon the beta went away
because there was no write blocker

144
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:21,590
he wasn't born right and after seeing
that eBay said today attorney William

145
00:08:21,590 --> 00:08:25,030
business instructor overprotective
college I had me we could bring him in

146
00:08:25,030 --> 00:08:28,419
and I'd never done a criminal case I
said

147
00:08:28,419 --> 00:08:32,718
I'd be willing to talk to you about it
so I came in I started looking at it and

148
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:35,180
I i got quite an education from

149
00:08:35,180 --> 00:08:38,880
bolivia can be working for a firm the
docs

150
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:42,219
forensics are gonna learn a lot from the
guys in a bit don't find it a long time

151
00:08:42,219 --> 00:08:44,329
there was nobody for me to learn from

152
00:08:44,329 --> 00:08:48,890
so we I found out he added this to the
drive and I said well we can use this

153
00:08:48,890 --> 00:08:50,860
drive we need to get another drive

154
00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:55,110
now back to ban it took a long time to
image a drive how'd you like to be the

155
00:08:55,110 --> 00:08:56,300
cop gets now

156
00:08:56,300 --> 00:09:00,980
but thank all we need another copy I
Drive so he was not happy a party image

157
00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:03,339
the drive-in sent you know one files

158
00:09:03,339 --> 00:09:06,560
which are in case files I couldn't read
in case files at the time

159
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:10,140
there was no product that allowed me to
convert baton read it

160
00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:13,220
so it had to go back again I'm

161
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:16,370
there was no it was a series of arm

162
00:09:16,370 --> 00:09:19,660
funny problems with the case but

163
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:23,329
it turned out that I learned a lot and I
was able to help them out with its own

164
00:09:23,329 --> 00:09:27,770
that I got started are tied to cases
I've done

165
00:09:27,770 --> 00:09:30,900
sense then worse now where cyberstalking

166
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:34,500
embezzlement acceptable use policy
violation

167
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:37,780
potential for civil litigation this is
really interesting

168
00:09:37,780 --> 00:09:41,010
if you were in the forensic field or
you're planning on getting in the

169
00:09:41,010 --> 00:09:42,140
printed form

170
00:09:42,140 --> 00:09:46,920
op I was called by an attorney actually
was a turning red train returning

171
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:50,640
called me up and said we have a
defendant actually whether the pending

172
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:52,220
at we have a person

173
00:09:52,220 --> 00:09:55,600
who's worried about getting sued and the

174
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:59,230
evidence that he's not guilty is on

175
00:09:59,230 --> 00:10:02,959
I work computer but he's quitting

176
00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:07,329
anne's worried that bed the end it had
nothing to do with work work didn't have

177
00:10:07,329 --> 00:10:08,240
a prominent

178
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:11,949
he's worried at three months or four
months down the road

179
00:10:11,949 --> 00:10:16,589
all that data will be gone and that
person will come back to zoom in or out

180
00:10:16,589 --> 00:10:18,980
no way to prove that he was innocent

181
00:10:18,980 --> 00:10:23,640
can you help us out and I ended up doing
with the parental came into the drive

182
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:27,130
and handing it to them and I thought to
myself what a what would bring their

183
00:10:27,130 --> 00:10:28,180
cash cow

184
00:10:28,180 --> 00:10:31,660
right you start advertising to the
attorneys look if you ever have this

185
00:10:31,660 --> 00:10:32,569
problem

186
00:10:32,569 --> 00:10:35,849
you might wanna image the drives and
save the data

187
00:10:35,850 --> 00:10:41,459
in the state of Wisconsin law was passed
and now the law says that K 12 educators

188
00:10:41,459 --> 00:10:45,280
who are and I use this term mostly

189
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:48,360
clots surfing porn at work

190
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:51,959
iight now I don't know what that means I
don't know what that means

191
00:10:51,959 --> 00:10:55,610
someone walked up behind them and saw
them certain point work or

192
00:10:55,610 --> 00:10:58,699
the logs say they were surfing porn at
work

193
00:10:58,699 --> 00:11:03,100
there's a huge difference there they can
now be fired

194
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:07,670
and a minute they're locking out I sent
out an email to all the k12 institutions

195
00:11:07,670 --> 00:11:08,699
in my area

196
00:11:08,699 --> 00:11:12,020
and I said what are you doing to
preserve the evidence

197
00:11:12,020 --> 00:11:17,089
in the case they're not guilty of that I
got a few responses backs be basically

198
00:11:17,089 --> 00:11:19,610
saying we don't do anything like that

199
00:11:19,610 --> 00:11:22,680
and the rest amor no response which
basically means we don't we're not doing

200
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:24,740
anything like that and I thought

201
00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:27,780
back to potential for civil litigation
if you're

202
00:11:27,780 --> 00:11:32,260
in that position find somebody who can
parenthetically image the drive so that

203
00:11:32,260 --> 00:11:36,870
the evidence that you're not guilty is
still around and I do CPK CCP stands for

204
00:11:36,870 --> 00:11:40,400
child pornography

205
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:45,230
when it comes to CP many seasoned
professionals don't take the caissons

206
00:11:45,230 --> 00:11:48,390
in fact many seasoned professionals
don't take defense cases

207
00:11:48,390 --> 00:11:52,209
so it's very difficult for you to find
somebody if you get involved in a case

208
00:11:52,209 --> 00:11:52,959
like that

209
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:56,000
and I'm presuming you innocent the brat

210
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:00,459
at Brunswick analyst with a lot of
experience to help you many cases

211
00:12:00,459 --> 00:12:04,730
on the east coast have professionals are
on the west coast on the west coast have

212
00:12:04,730 --> 00:12:06,520
professionals are on the east coast

213
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:10,709
people hapa travel that far in order to
get somebody

214
00:12:10,709 --> 00:12:15,380
I take your case to get a seasoned
professional somebody's dealt with it

215
00:12:15,380 --> 00:12:19,320
so if you get involved in one his case
and that's it's rather difficult to find

216
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:21,120
somebody who is competent to help you

217
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:24,589
unless you're you're lucky you'll hear
you I'm I'm assuming many have you are

218
00:12:24,589 --> 00:12:26,320
on the east coast so you might have

219
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:29,610
are professionals out there might be a
state away but they're out here

220
00:12:29,610 --> 00:12:33,640
and again I'm I the hope selection

Innocence Project thank contacted all
kinda people and and they just said nice

224
00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:47,610

00:12:47,610 --> 00:12:50,790

Gilby before proven innocent minute when

money's good I love this quote

228
00:12:59,350 --> 00:13:02,850
I'm not in favor of imprisoning the
innocent but I'm not enthusiastic about

229
00:13:02,850 --> 00:13:04,450
bring the guilty either

230
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:08,560
that's where I am height so let's talk
is not about how to get

231
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:12,700
get away with a crime and I and II will
I like hearing some other previous are

232
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:17,040
moyer talks say that also I'm not here
to say who it but if you do this you get

233
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:17,769
away with it

234
00:13:17,769 --> 00:13:22,060
that's now I'm here I'm here is to show
you how easy it is

235
00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:25,660
to get prosecuted and potentially
convicted

236
00:13:25,660 --> 00:13:28,740
up a crime you did not commit %ah

237
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:33,830
in and the cases that I bell with I'm
always amazed at how much evidence

238
00:13:33,830 --> 00:13:36,940
is brought up again somebody and its
propolis

239
00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:41,100
and and its easily proven but its that
there is no evidence there

240
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:44,140
so that's why I'm here okay

241
00:13:44,140 --> 00:13:48,699
let's talk about accidental ballots

242
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:52,390
mind I have some images you have to
press card security scheme and

243
00:13:52,390 --> 00:13:56,420

245
00:14:01,790 --> 00:14:05,240
and the question is what do these images
mean

246
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:09,589
to the average user

247
00:14:09,589 --> 00:14:12,980

give that many t-shirts a rep

254
00:14:37,649 --> 00:14:41,839
absolutely nothing it means somebody was
able to put an icon on a Web site

255
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:46,320
somebody with her or or somebody saw
them a service in a service doesn't mean

256
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:47,779
at exactly right

257
00:14:47,779 --> 00:14:51,100
alright so now that we've covered that

258
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:55,060
and we understand that let's take a look
at this

259
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:59,510
aright I i cant buy I did because
because I can't

260
00:14:59,510 --> 00:15:03,399
show my presentation backside at
screenshot

261
00:15:03,399 --> 00:15:06,810
is a statement and it basically says
this website

262
00:15:06,810 --> 00:15:10,920
adheres to USC title eighteen

263
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:17,269
section blah blah blah blah blah all
persons on this website are 18 years old

264
00:15:17,269 --> 00:15:21,180
and I was involved in a case where the
defendant I was brought in by the

265
00:15:21,180 --> 00:15:22,070
attorney

266
00:15:22,070 --> 00:15:25,089
literally to validate

267
00:15:25,089 --> 00:15:28,440
what his client was saying

268
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:33,329
not pick Ryan said it to the prosecution
which he but I was told it he told the

269
00:15:33,329 --> 00:15:34,089
police lock

270
00:15:34,089 --> 00:15:37,459
every website I went to had this
statement on it he also may be made

271
00:15:37,459 --> 00:15:39,149
about five statements

272
00:15:39,149 --> 00:15:42,810
that and if you talk to an opportunity
to find out

273
00:15:42,810 --> 00:15:46,389
be the prosecutor's job is not to defend
you

274
00:15:46,389 --> 00:15:49,700
so they don't care what you say you
could say yeah I did that there'd

275
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:53,310
in in my in my experience they're not
gonna go we analyze the driving so yeah

276
00:15:53,310 --> 00:15:54,470
you're right

277
00:15:54,470 --> 00:15:57,880
they say your attorneys that your
attorney job getting expert

278
00:15:57,880 --> 00:16:00,880
and go analyze the dry so the attorney
he had

279
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:04,010
contacted me and said he sees may be
spied statements

280
00:16:04,010 --> 00:16:07,279
I'm a talk about two and one is he said
that this statement was on these web

281
00:16:07,279 --> 00:16:08,480
sites

282
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:11,899
and I said we'll look at the charge
report does the charred reports say

283
00:16:11,899 --> 00:16:15,970
where which website he went to download
this illegal content. apparently some

284
00:16:15,970 --> 00:16:17,410
other minor

285
00:16:17,410 --> 00:16:20,670
and I said and I we actually was proud
of myself I said

286
00:16:20,670 --> 00:16:24,170
paid go to the Wayback Machine

287
00:16:24,170 --> 00:16:28,230
in and and I don't know that you don't
know that there's a there's a website

288
00:16:28,230 --> 00:16:29,779
out there the passions

289
00:16:29,779 --> 00:16:33,060

Internet

290
00:16:33,060 --> 00:16:36,110

machine and sure enough their the

291
00:16:36,110 --> 00:16:38,250
statements on his web site I so there

292
00:16:38,250 --> 00:16:42,089
Sony he was reading the web site and the
web site at that statement

293
00:16:42,089 --> 00:16:45,170
another thing he said is look I
downloaded the guy was in the

294
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:46,510
pornography

295
00:16:46,510 --> 00:16:50,980
I'm not wrong but that's not illegal I
was downloading

296
00:16:50,980 --> 00:16:54,959
these piles in mass I was doing great
big downloads I don't know what was that

297

in no state no I'm I get a thousand
files in one writer was nm

298
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:02,769
alright so what does it mean when

299
00:17:02,769 --> 00:17:07,000
everybody understand the files might
have a created timestamp

300
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:11,130
on access timestamp and a modified
timestamp

301
00:17:11,130 --> 00:17:15,570
what does it mean when the modified
timestamp

302
00:17:15,569 --> 00:17:21,629
is be four the created timestamp

303
00:17:21,630 --> 00:17:28,079
how can you modify a fob report created

304
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:31,240
nod not good

305
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:35,310
nope not moved

306
00:17:35,310 --> 00:17:42,158
not not tamper

307
00:17:42,159 --> 00:17:45,399
nope

308
00:17:45,399 --> 00:17:47,779
nope Sep by I'll

309
00:17:47,779 --> 00:17:53,299
when you download a compressed zip file
when you 1 compress it

310
00:17:53,299 --> 00:17:57,289
recreated bait will be different than
the modified date

311
00:17:57,289 --> 00:18:00,700
Heights Ohio I look too bad I said

312
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:04,700
that's kinda haydn and I look it up as I
go that's why it's because the game but

313
00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:05,279
it's all

314
00:18:05,279 --> 00:18:08,509
basically what I did when I did the
analysis I ponder the guy was a line I

315
00:18:08,509 --> 00:18:10,190
want to tell you guys now lie in

316
00:18:10,190 --> 00:18:14,889
so again the prosecutors not gonna do
that work you gonna hire some media

317
00:18:14,889 --> 00:18:16,120
networking will be cheap

318
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:20,559
I was also called same attorney called
me up and said I got a guy I don't know

319
00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:22,668
if that makes any sense he's telling me

320
00:18:22,669 --> 00:18:27,049
he was just arrested an at the end it's
limewire

321
00:18:27,049 --> 00:18:30,090
limeWire is not around i'm watch
crossfire he was just arrested

322
00:18:30,090 --> 00:18:35,209
and he's telling me you know anything
about this child porn on a system

323
00:18:35,210 --> 00:18:37,830
is that possible is it possible he's
good

324
00:18:37,830 --> 00:18:42,000
downloaded this and didn't know and I
said well let me run a cast so I when I

325
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:42,390
got

326
00:18:42,390 --> 00:18:47,220
why mine installed it and I did a search
for commercials rated G

327
00:18:47,220 --> 00:18:52,480
and ice started that search engine and
all these things start to happen now let

328
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:53,950
me ask a question

329
00:18:53,950 --> 00:18:58,490
when someone has 20 30 40 files in front
of them

330
00:18:58,490 --> 00:19:02,700
and they want to copy them or download
them how do they do that

331
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:09,700
one at a time he select the mall right
use a leadership click to select the

332
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:10,520
mall

333
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:13,830
any download now with LimeWire Prost
wire

334
00:19:13,830 --> 00:19:18,000
it might be three or four days before
those download end up on your computer

335
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,050
why did that on the test I didn't
download em

336
00:19:21,050 --> 00:19:25,010
I did this commercial rated G in you can
see it there it says %uh teen sex very

337
00:19:25,010 --> 00:19:26,170
young girls orgy

338
00:19:26,170 --> 00:19:30,640
well you can but they backed their camp
I

339
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:33,950
so I'll Iran this test and it showed up

340
00:19:33,950 --> 00:19:37,050
well then I was like alright well looks
like it's possible me I

341
00:19:37,050 --> 00:19:41,060
close everything down rear and the cast
video recorded it and sent it off to be

342
00:19:41,060 --> 00:19:41,560
attorney

343
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:46,090
this guy never gets back to me quickly
these attorneys a busy guy

344
00:19:46,090 --> 00:19:49,909
five minutes later the subject was holy
shit

345
00:19:49,910 --> 00:19:53,680
in the body was it's that easy

346
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:57,520
iight so there you go is it possible I
think

347
00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:00,520
we kinda covered there's a possibility

348
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:05,139
right gotta got some it's a possibility
talk to now want to do a quick scenario

349
00:20:05,140 --> 00:20:06,250
based exercise

350
00:20:06,250 --> 00:20:09,410
might

351
00:20:09,410 --> 00:20:13,090
a profit my process and again I'm one
guy born

352
00:20:13,090 --> 00:20:16,110
defense forensics in Wisconsin I don't
know how it is out here

353
00:20:16,110 --> 00:20:19,430
I don't know how it is when a bomb but
this is how it is for me it starts with

354
00:20:19,430 --> 00:20:20,240
a phone call

355
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:24,310
and typically there's an effort to C PKC
there's an attorney on the other side

356
00:20:24,310 --> 00:20:25,510
apologizing to me

357
00:20:25,510 --> 00:20:26,540
myron sign

358
00:20:26,540 --> 00:20:29,620
to bring and in this case you know my
name it's a CB days

359
00:20:29,620 --> 00:20:34,010
I I determine whether or not I want
accept the job

360
00:20:34,010 --> 00:20:37,520
and for me because I have a primary job

361
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:41,810
I don't have to worry about the income
which is really nice because I can say

362
00:20:41,810 --> 00:20:46,310
don't have time sorry find somebody else
well I can accept the job

363
00:20:46,310 --> 00:20:51,450
by accept the job typically they send me
a case file back a smile is lotsa

364
00:20:51,450 --> 00:20:51,930
reading

365
00:20:51,930 --> 00:20:56,400
and I show you in another couple screams
mean an extreme how many documents I

366
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:57,180
after Reid

367
00:20:57,180 --> 00:21:00,480
if you're interested in computer
forensics is a job

368
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:04,900
you better like reading reports because
it's

369
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:10,090
tons a reports then I read those reports
and I discuss the possibilities with the

370
00:21:10,090 --> 00:21:12,870
attorney in this is very difficult
especially in CP

371
00:21:12,870 --> 00:21:15,970
especially when you're reading reports I
don't know by you

372
00:21:15,970 --> 00:21:19,870
probably the average Joe potentially
doesn't trust the cops I read those

373
00:21:19,870 --> 00:21:22,460
reports and I want to trust the cops

374
00:21:22,460 --> 00:21:26,300
I'd I'd I don't anymore but i wanna
trust um

375
00:21:26,300 --> 00:21:30,800
I wanna trust that what they're saying
is factual what I've learned is now I

376
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:34,870
can really trust that I we can really
trust that I can really trust that and

377
00:21:34,870 --> 00:21:38,310
and so I discuss the possibilities with
the attorney do they have this guy did

378
00:21:38,310 --> 00:21:38,960
the rights

379
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:42,130
or is there something they had it but I
can analyze and help them out

380
00:21:42,130 --> 00:21:46,170
then I up the conduct the exam now this
may require travel

381
00:21:46,170 --> 00:21:50,580
the last case I did I had to go down to
the Department a criminal investigations

382
00:21:50,580 --> 00:21:53,600
in Madison bad six hours work on my job

383
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:56,710
and the way I charge when I'm driving in
the car

384
00:21:56,710 --> 00:22:00,190
or I'm doing forensics same price it's
an hour my life

385
00:22:00,190 --> 00:22:04,640
snack it's buried you should understand
if you're innocent you're involved in

386
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:05,770
one of these crimes

387
00:22:05,770 --> 00:22:09,780
are you being prosecuted for one his
crimes it's going to get very expensive

388
00:22:09,780 --> 00:22:11,040
very quickly

389
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:14,399
they don't allow you to have the drive
anymore

390
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:18,080
they used to dye used to having attorney
get a copy to drive and I would leave it

391
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:18,980
at his

392
00:22:18,980 --> 00:22:23,730
I had I office and I would conduct my
analysis the I would be overlap there

393
00:22:23,730 --> 00:22:27,010
conduct the analysis maybe that would
take a few days and then I take Meg

394
00:22:27,010 --> 00:22:28,450
Whitman down he did a report

395
00:22:28,450 --> 00:22:31,630
now I have to drive to crime and then

396
00:22:31,630 --> 00:22:35,820
a question to render a conclusion so
let's look at your in my classroom

397
00:22:35,820 --> 00:22:40,040
or you're involved in a case what that
might look like hike

398
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:43,180
client file documents you might get

399
00:22:43,180 --> 00:22:47,170
correspondence between attorneys letters
and emails many times especially with

400
00:22:47,170 --> 00:22:48,240
the CP caissons

401
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:52,270
one attorney gets better gets the job
done and then figures

402
00:22:52,270 --> 00:22:56,510
I don't know enough about this and get
another attorney and maybe Dad attorney

403
00:22:56,510 --> 00:22:57,600
get another attorney

404
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:01,640
so you end up with I end up with this
pile a paper cut this a burn in an hour

405
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:03,290
but as a dynamic considering

406
00:23:03,290 --> 00:23:07,690
supplement demand for discovery an
inspection notice a final pre-trial

407
00:23:07,690 --> 00:23:11,030
conference in twelve-person jury trial
in reading this come in small onion a

408
00:23:11,030 --> 00:23:12,149
back rub against the yen

409
00:23:12,150 --> 00:23:16,890
motion for discovery information request
for substitution a judge criminal

410
00:23:16,890 --> 00:23:17,870
complaint more

411
00:23:17,870 --> 00:23:23,000
at I use that one a lot search warrant I
used that 1a lot

412
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:26,250
affidavit for a search warrant case
reports

413
00:23:26,250 --> 00:23:30,050
investigative reports much are
tape-recorded interviews

414
00:23:30,050 --> 00:23:34,220
stipulation knowledge and search warrant
with charred report stipulation and

415
00:23:34,220 --> 00:23:35,900
order on discovery order on discovery

416
00:23:35,900 --> 00:23:39,830
criminal complaint and treatment
evaluation when why why you to get out

417
00:23:39,830 --> 00:23:40,659
all back

418
00:23:40,660 --> 00:23:44,290
but right now that's one thing but a
lotta reading

419
00:23:44,290 --> 00:23:48,230
number two ready your will be remiss in
not gonna crush the money

420
00:23:48,230 --> 00:23:51,990
whether you're guilty risen I'm gonna
know things about you I don't wanna know

421
00:23:51,990 --> 00:23:52,760
about you

422
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:58,870
your attorneys gonna know things about
you you see that treatment the valuation

423
00:23:58,870 --> 00:24:03,820
bats that you went in to talk to
somebody about juror sexual habits

424
00:24:03,820 --> 00:24:07,659
I'm not interested but it's all in there

425
00:24:07,660 --> 00:24:11,870
so understand whether you're guilty or
not guilty all that stuff

426
00:24:11,870 --> 00:24:15,880
post your attorney goes to top forensic
examiner

427
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:20,890
it said were may go to them another very
interesting thing that I think you will

428
00:24:20,890 --> 00:24:21,810
find interesting

429
00:24:21,810 --> 00:24:24,840
is that investigative report I recently
bought a case

430
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:28,360
where piped piped recorded interview

431
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:31,640
so you understand the piece a paper I'm
reading but has

432
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:35,610
the words that were saddened type 2 said

433
00:24:35,610 --> 00:24:38,770
the defendant said he liked young

434
00:24:38,770 --> 00:24:42,760
women the actual recording said

435
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:46,720
you like young-looking moment I like
young looking women

436
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:51,250
persons I like young women there is a
huge difference there

437
00:24:51,250 --> 00:24:54,260
so if you ever involved in a case make
sure

438
00:24:54,260 --> 00:24:58,610
and this is why i cant trusted anymore
as while I wanna trusted by can trust

439
00:24:58,610 --> 00:24:58,860
that

440
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:02,740
make sure that you're reading everything
this type in your validating and

441
00:25:02,740 --> 00:25:04,250
everything like that on the recording

442
00:25:04,250 --> 00:25:08,110
luckily the attorney but read that
document knew what was going on

443
00:25:08,110 --> 00:25:11,370
and read it and validated talk

444
00:25:11,370 --> 00:25:15,350
so now we're going to get into an
examination upper approximation

445
00:25:15,350 --> 00:25:18,620
from all those documents

446
00:25:18,620 --> 00:25:22,480
you can create an examination plan I
have to do this now know the Buner

447
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:25,679
involved in forensic sorry been watching
any porn the stock you might hear the

448
00:25:25,679 --> 00:25:27,490
term sniper forensics

449
00:25:27,490 --> 00:25:31,530
it's almost imperative that you do that
now especially if you have to travel if

450
00:25:31,530 --> 00:25:32,899
I put on a Madison

451
00:25:32,900 --> 00:25:36,340
to do an examination I wanna know
everything that i'm gonna go

452
00:25:36,340 --> 00:25:40,130
for at the time ago for right away so

453
00:25:40,130 --> 00:25:44,370
I am in our Pictish its our case here

454
00:25:44,370 --> 00:25:48,400
the cases that are being baller revolve
around the program frostwire which is

455
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:49,160
now

456
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:53,130
are the predecessor to rhyme I
remembered as I'm happy where I'm are

457
00:25:53,130 --> 00:25:54,170
used to be limewire

458
00:25:54,170 --> 00:25:56,299
now proxmire

459
00:25:56,299 --> 00:25:59,599
wanna know that there was more says more
than one system investigated

460
00:25:59,599 --> 00:26:02,950
so we need to know which one to the
systems has illegal content. I was

461
00:26:02,950 --> 00:26:04,070
worried when I went down

462
00:26:04,070 --> 00:26:07,210
the Department of Criminal
Investigations there to have all these

463
00:26:07,210 --> 00:26:11,460
drives and I'm a nap analyze everyone
from the final 1 I'm interested in

464
00:26:11,460 --> 00:26:16,349
and I asked the job examiners you can
you tell me why did I didn't know if you

465
00:26:16,349 --> 00:26:19,539
could tell me not can you tell me which
one of these drives as the one that on a

466
00:26:19,539 --> 00:26:22,769
criminal complaint picked up and bands
like that same happen our

467
00:26:22,769 --> 00:26:28,339
I'm interested in saving money it will
also tell you file names past files

468
00:26:28,339 --> 00:26:31,549
created last accessed last written
description and hash value

469
00:26:31,549 --> 00:26:35,099
if you don't have big I don't tend to
read the descriptions

470
00:26:35,099 --> 00:26:40,549
I don't care what's in the file from a
forensic standpoint I'm here

471
00:26:40,549 --> 00:26:44,679
to see was this file opened: can I tell
when it was opened et cetera

472
00:26:44,679 --> 00:26:48,029
I don't know what in the pile if you
don't have a I

473
00:26:48,029 --> 00:26:52,009
pics stomach don't read the descriptions
and these files

474
00:26:52,009 --> 00:26:55,529
pair awful what these people do two kids
and what these videos are

475
00:26:55,529 --> 00:26:58,849
and what these images are so I try not
to read them

476
00:26:58,849 --> 00:27:04,668
right we have to talk a little bit of a
lot about the law

477
00:27:04,669 --> 00:27:09,589
because in order to did to know what we
have to go to what we want to do we have

478
00:27:09,589 --> 00:27:10,849
to know what the law states

479
00:27:10,849 --> 00:27:14,158
again none of us well somebody might
realize I'm not a liar

480
00:27:14,159 --> 00:27:19,659
most likely you're not a lawyer but
Wisconsin lost eight states said

481
00:27:19,659 --> 00:27:23,369
the person knows that he or she
possesses the person knows the character

482
00:27:23,369 --> 00:27:26,779
in content the person knows or
reasonably should know

483
00:27:26,779 --> 00:27:30,940
whoever does any the following with
knowledge so when I analyze these

484
00:27:30,940 --> 00:27:31,749
systems

485
00:27:31,749 --> 00:27:34,879
i'm looking for. knowledge I have to
prove

486
00:27:34,879 --> 00:27:38,029
that this person knew that they did it
perhaps what we're looking for

487
00:27:38,029 --> 00:27:41,099
when we do realize and systems now take
a look at a typical case

488
00:27:41,099 --> 00:27:45,859
evaluating the case we have a fact
illegal content was on the drive

489
00:27:45,859 --> 00:27:48,889
that's a fact this is how it works

490
00:27:48,889 --> 00:27:52,309
you to call with the legal kind of the
questions after him I'm

491
00:27:52,309 --> 00:27:57,408
you get caught with illegal content on
your drive typically the police

492
00:27:57,409 --> 00:28:01,349
already have a hatch value with the file
it on your drive and Nash value goes

493
00:28:01,349 --> 00:28:02,489
back to a database

494
00:28:02,489 --> 00:28:05,769
and that databases other illegal
content. and they know

495
00:28:05,769 --> 00:28:09,009
it illegal contact you're not gonna
argue that it's not illegal contact

496
00:28:09,009 --> 00:28:13,679
can we prove it was intentionally or
unintentionally got there

497
00:28:13,679 --> 00:28:18,339
how remember earlier to scream it's
possible

498
00:28:18,339 --> 00:28:21,619
so now we have to know how is that done
how did that happen

499
00:28:21,619 --> 00:28:25,269
can we prove that they intentionally did
it work could have been a mistake

500
00:28:25,269 --> 00:28:28,940
I got a couple opinions here the
opinions are

501
00:28:28,940 --> 00:28:32,559
the prosecutors opinions defended Nepal
think this could

502
00:28:32,559 --> 00:28:35,839
defended new defiance and the reason
though their opinions

503
00:28:35,839 --> 00:28:40,330
is because when I get the criminal
complaint it basically lists

504
00:28:40,330 --> 00:28:43,820
typically 10 files are under

505
00:28:43,820 --> 00:28:48,989
the the files and I'm be easily accessed
dates and better

506
00:28:48,989 --> 00:28:52,909
no analysis know we checked this and
this and this and this

507
00:28:52,909 --> 00:28:56,070
that's what they prosecute on go get
yourself an attorney and

508
00:28:56,070 --> 00:28:59,249
and come back with something else they
may do an additional analysis

509
00:28:59,249 --> 00:29:02,460
but they're gonna prosecute on that one
piece a paper so

510
00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:05,619
will look to see if there's evidence to
substantiate these claims in

511
00:29:05,619 --> 00:29:10,369
how we can expect substantiated art
intentional download make

512
00:29:10,369 --> 00:29:15,139
one saw the it's possible it might not
have been intentional in every case i've

513
00:29:15,139 --> 00:29:15,919
done

514
00:29:15,919 --> 00:29:20,299
there's been a stare down along in these
long documents there's been a statement

515
00:29:20,299 --> 00:29:23,869
from da about typically it's about

516
00:29:23,869 --> 00:29:29,279
P prosecutors expert and it says this I
this person

517
00:29:29,279 --> 00:29:33,769
I back to the name knows to training and
experience that additional two piles

518
00:29:33,769 --> 00:29:34,329
name

519
00:29:34,329 --> 00:29:38,119
additional files me a file name does not
never a case

520
00:29:38,119 --> 00:29:42,999
ackerly identify its contents and what
they're trying to do their use cash

521
00:29:42,999 --> 00:29:43,619
values

522
00:29:43,619 --> 00:29:47,399
and what they're trying to say is we
have this ash value this hash values on

523
00:29:47,399 --> 00:29:48,969
your computer

524
00:29:48,969 --> 00:29:53,710
we don't care what the file name says it
is it illegal content. because we have a

525
00:29:53,710 --> 00:29:54,419
hash value

526
00:29:54,419 --> 00:29:55,820
and they're right

527
00:29:55,820 --> 00:29:58,780
the cash value of illegal content.
they've proven in another jurisdiction

528
00:29:58,780 --> 00:30:00,160
it illegal

529
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:03,870
it's illegal content. what I like to do
is

530
00:30:03,870 --> 00:30:07,530
say all right then but i wanna be a lil
same say the same thing

531
00:30:07,530 --> 00:30:10,210
if there's a file name

532
00:30:10,210 --> 00:30:14,340
that's bed blatantly NZ illegal content.

533
00:30:14,340 --> 00:30:19,540
based upon a family made may not be
illegal contact it may be said maybe

534
00:30:19,540 --> 00:30:22,980
do kittens I don't know what it is if
the file name

535
00:30:22,980 --> 00:30:27,340
I so but we can use violence basically
what I'm saying there you can use a

536
00:30:27,340 --> 00:30:27,840
bombing

537
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:30,910
so we have a possibility

538
00:30:30,910 --> 00:30:34,200
is a possible but a legitimate search
provided

539
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:39,109
illegal an illegal result I want you to
think about this

540
00:30:39,109 --> 00:30:42,609
so I believe in

541
00:30:42,609 --> 00:30:45,700
many cases the

542
00:30:45,700 --> 00:30:49,529
in da search ministry will show intent

543
00:30:49,529 --> 00:30:54,409
now parents cases where malware modified
your searches trainers cases were

544
00:30:54,409 --> 00:30:57,659
somebody else was using the computer
notice I didn't say the defendant

545
00:30:57,659 --> 00:31:01,580
alright but I believe generally search
industry will show

546
00:31:01,580 --> 00:31:05,428
intent but if you find a search term
Falcon

547
00:31:05,429 --> 00:31:09,090
was someone looking for the bird or the
team

548
00:31:09,090 --> 00:31:12,899
Sol is it possible

549
00:31:12,899 --> 00:31:16,889
that using search terms general search
terms

550
00:31:16,889 --> 00:31:21,049
will provide illegal results I think the
answers

551
00:31:21,049 --> 00:31:25,230
yes if you were searching the dryer
young men in the audience if you were

552
00:31:25,230 --> 00:31:27,139
searching for the word porn

553
00:31:27,139 --> 00:31:30,350
might you end up with kiddie porn

554
00:31:30,350 --> 00:31:33,919
but if you're searching for terms

555
00:31:33,919 --> 00:31:38,179
specific to kiddie porn you're probably
looking for kiddie porn

556
00:31:38,179 --> 00:31:42,440
and at that point I'm done right I might
look and say well aware that now where

557
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:44,190
was the defendant log on to another

558
00:31:44,190 --> 00:31:47,549
another site with the login with email
et cetera alright

559
00:31:47,549 --> 00:31:50,460
and then I get to get all the attorneys
am done with this one I am I don't need

560
00:31:50,460 --> 00:31:51,289
to go any further

561
00:31:51,289 --> 00:31:55,080
if i cant find search history well and
we have to move on

562
00:31:55,080 --> 00:32:00,029
so we find very specific search terms
looking for illegal content. buying our

563
00:32:00,029 --> 00:32:02,129
other use it after we might find in 10

564
00:32:02,129 --> 00:32:08,980
so let's start there but the frostwire
program searches tree is not saved on

565
00:32:08,980 --> 00:32:09,629
exit

566
00:32:09,629 --> 00:32:13,019
well that's problematic force if you're
innocent

567
00:32:13,019 --> 00:32:18,190
was the system on when see so now I have
to go back to that

568
00:32:18,190 --> 00:32:21,239
that mister documents and I have to find
out

569
00:32:21,239 --> 00:32:24,369
when they see this computer was it on a
state Iran

570
00:32:24,369 --> 00:32:28,669
was the search history photograph right
if they know

571
00:32:28,669 --> 00:32:32,289
and they do we're gonna go confiscate
this computer

572
00:32:32,289 --> 00:32:36,869
because we've searched the limewire
network and found illegal content on a

573
00:32:36,869 --> 00:32:37,759
computer

574
00:32:37,759 --> 00:32:41,580
then they oughta know they're going for
LimeWire and they oughta know I hope

575
00:32:41,580 --> 00:32:43,418
because they're supposed to be experts

576
00:32:43,419 --> 00:32:47,159
limewire doesn't save it searches tree
and circuitry should show intent

577
00:32:47,159 --> 00:32:52,159
soul before you shut the system down
hibernated run plug it

578
00:32:52,159 --> 00:32:55,129
click you don't take a picture
researchers tracked I'm gonna be looking

579
00:32:55,129 --> 00:32:56,320
for that in the report

580
00:32:56,320 --> 00:33:01,149
was the rear managed anybody in here
does computer forensics you probably

581
00:33:01,149 --> 00:33:01,950
heard about

582
00:33:01,950 --> 00:33:05,559
managing the RAM right we got image
ceramic the ram was image

583
00:33:05,559 --> 00:33:10,450
then I have what's up in in a search
history maybe the system was hibernated

584
00:33:10,450 --> 00:33:13,659
in that case I can look at the
hibernation file and I can I might be

585
00:33:13,659 --> 00:33:15,499
able to extract the search is going from
there

586
00:33:15,499 --> 00:33:20,460
and this is a needle in a haystack maybe
the ram was written to the pagefile at

587
00:33:20,460 --> 00:33:21,450
some point I'm

588
00:33:21,450 --> 00:33:25,129
I had never even done that analysis
right

589
00:33:25,129 --> 00:33:32,129
so we have all these all these
possibilities from a search warrant as a

590
00:33:32,159 --> 00:33:36,210
result in a search warrant several items
electron storage medically our media

591
00:33:36,210 --> 00:33:37,669
equipment was located

592
00:33:37,669 --> 00:33:40,759
but there's no mention a state honor of
there's no mention

593
00:33:40,759 --> 00:33:44,919
up conducting arrive analysis in fact I
talk to prosecutors in my area

594
00:33:44,919 --> 00:33:48,119
and they wouldn't Bay Bay Bay Buccaneers
arrive in ours is what's that

595
00:33:48,119 --> 00:33:53,029
image RAM I've never seen that in a
report so in my area the country

596
00:33:53,029 --> 00:33:56,950
they're not doing that I know what
they're doing out here

597
00:33:56,950 --> 00:34:01,249
but now potentially evidence that proves
my

598
00:34:01,249 --> 00:34:04,379
client that dope attorney-client
innocent is gone

599
00:34:04,379 --> 00:34:10,419
because they didn't do the seizure
property so all we got there alright

600
00:34:10,418 --> 00:34:13,270
well let's see if we can prove it the
file reviewed

601
00:34:13,270 --> 00:34:17,129
what do you think I'm gonna do is

602
00:34:17,129 --> 00:34:20,569
how does the person typically view files
right

603
00:34:20,569 --> 00:34:23,589
I wanna look and see how this computer
typically use and

604
00:34:23,589 --> 00:34:26,788
and we might look at the registry most
recently used entries

605
00:34:26,789 --> 00:34:31,000
our recent file list entries the fine
art why do they open a Jay pag

606
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:34,569
out in the open our mp3 file out in the
open an mp4 file

607
00:34:34,569 --> 00:34:38,509
so we're gonna we're gonna wanna know
that possibility

608
00:34:38,510 --> 00:34:42,089
from knowing that is the file names
exist in the registry where the file

609
00:34:42,089 --> 00:34:45,849
names don't exist in reg we got we r
honor of their simple

610
00:34:45,849 --> 00:34:50,159
if the illegal files that are on the
criminal warrant

611
00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:56,359
are in the registry buying someone else
access the files were done

612
00:34:56,359 --> 00:34:59,640
right there they are if the file names

613
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:03,020
art in the registry the file in question
are not listed

614
00:35:03,020 --> 00:35:06,920
they could have been accessed too long
ago or accessed in some other fashion

615
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:10,520
or not accessed so we go into the
registry

616
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:12,570
ended

617
00:35:12,570 --> 00:35:15,800
we have a fact after Windows registry
examination it was found that the type

618
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:16,070
in

619
00:35:16,070 --> 00:35:19,150
are the files are the type in question

620
00:35:19,150 --> 00:35:22,460
were recently accessed using typical
Windows programs

621
00:35:22,460 --> 00:35:26,619
but the files in question were not
listed so what does that tell us

622
00:35:26,619 --> 00:35:29,859
that says this is how we opens J pegs

623
00:35:29,859 --> 00:35:33,380
but the particular J pegs and he's being
prosecuted are

624
00:35:33,380 --> 00:35:36,630
are not in there we have a little bit
more evidence

625
00:35:36,630 --> 00:35:41,150
a surge arrester register was performed
in a file in question were found well

626
00:35:41,150 --> 00:35:46,070
now we know something's we have some
possibilities

627
00:35:46,070 --> 00:35:49,579
piled in question were not recently
accessed

628
00:35:49,579 --> 00:35:52,940
not access the taller access in some
other manner

629
00:35:52,940 --> 00:35:58,630
now let's talk about probability the
probability is the files were not

630
00:35:58,630 --> 00:36:00,660
accessed recently are not access the
tall

631
00:36:00,660 --> 00:36:04,839
how many normal users go either way to
access certain content in an entirely

632
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:07,220
different manner than all the other
content on your system

633
00:36:07,220 --> 00:36:12,420
I open cats with this program but dog
tape Exile open with this program

634
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:16,600
it's not probable so

635
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:19,640
we're getting closer to some answers
here

636
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:24,080
so let's talk about frostwire downloads

637
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:27,620
one of the things that you absolutely
Afghanistan you gonna get on a computer

638
00:36:27,620 --> 00:36:28,720
forensic says

639
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:31,760
you have to know everything about
everything which is impossible

640
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:35,600
so when you get a case you're gonna get
a program in if you want

641
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:38,990
if you don't know what that program is
air how it works you have to hope and

642
00:36:38,990 --> 00:36:41,420
pray somebody's written a beautiful
white paper

643
00:36:41,420 --> 00:36:45,430
otherwise you have to do all the
analysis figure out how it works where

644
00:36:45,430 --> 00:36:46,569
it saves things

645
00:36:46,570 --> 00:36:50,410
luckily there are some frostwire white
papers out there and we went out and

646
00:36:50,410 --> 00:36:53,330
read them and we found that the download
directory for what brought wire

647
00:36:53,330 --> 00:36:56,640
can be fuck found in the directory for
saving files entry

648
00:36:56,640 --> 00:37:00,790
and the frostwire dot props prop now we
know okay but we can find out what the

649
00:37:00,790 --> 00:37:02,910
download directory as well why wouldn't
want to do that

650
00:37:02,910 --> 00:37:07,730
because we have a possibility if the
files are located in the deep ball

651
00:37:07,730 --> 00:37:09,940
download directory for frostwire

652
00:37:09,940 --> 00:37:14,150
and the files were downloaded in mass
remember our ship click

653
00:37:14,150 --> 00:37:19,559
are a highlight everything and download
it they may never have been built

654
00:37:19,559 --> 00:37:23,920
but I really only have 10 minutes ago
sadly there's nobody after me

655
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:27,970
om you guys wanna stay

656
00:37:27,970 --> 00:37:31,420
might so so how do we determine s

657
00:37:31,420 --> 00:37:34,359
well we might have to look at the
created access written timestamp the

658
00:37:34,359 --> 00:37:36,920
registry entries recent files link file
that sector

659
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:40,039
we've got a lot of evidence that we can
look at so let's take a look at that

660
00:37:40,039 --> 00:37:43,490
evidence now this is what I get from
them

661
00:37:43,490 --> 00:37:46,670
you're only gonna see two files so you
understand right

662
00:37:46,670 --> 00:37:51,720
I can scroll down to piles when I get
typically is 10 files and they have the

663
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:54,170
that created access been written
timestamps

664
00:37:54,170 --> 00:37:58,539
now that doesn't tell you a lot when you
look at that it's hard to see but if I

665
00:37:58,539 --> 00:38:02,690
change the way that is will see the file
created

666
00:38:02,690 --> 00:38:06,240
and the file access now we look at the
file access to a diner

667
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:09,720
the file access time is one second away
from each other

668
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:13,289
now when you're looking at two files and
I did at large so you can see it

669
00:38:13,289 --> 00:38:17,999
that's not a big deal but if you are
looking at 50 or 100 files

670
00:38:17,999 --> 00:38:22,380
how is it possible to open one up view
it

671
00:38:22,380 --> 00:38:27,359
close it and open another one up and you
wouldn't close at do that fifty times

672
00:38:27,359 --> 00:38:33,009
anybody in your think they can do that
but you know it's it

673
00:38:33,009 --> 00:38:36,859
he won a t-shirt what size medium

674
00:38:36,859 --> 00:38:41,009
I think the only media mad at me well

675
00:38:41,009 --> 00:38:44,140
if you want to be a medium he can be a
medium

676
00:38:44,140 --> 00:38:48,029
will have muscles hiker probability

677
00:38:48,029 --> 00:38:51,759
rule number five now this is out of the
ER

678
00:38:51,759 --> 00:38:55,359
the rule time for NTFS file systems by
the way this is only good

679
00:38:55,359 --> 00:38:59,828
for Windows XP Windows seven rebounds
let me ask you this

680
00:38:59,829 --> 00:39:04,150
what is up what is the harm up how what
does it tell you what is a

681
00:39:04,150 --> 00:39:11,150
filed a timestamp value not much how it
saved me there's been an SRO near

682
00:39:11,759 --> 00:39:18,759
the word that their worry when will you
get my extra large

683
00:39:19,380 --> 00:39:23,690
sorry squeeze into it

684
00:39:23,690 --> 00:39:29,529
will be like this guy the correct answer
is it depends what is the operating

685
00:39:29,529 --> 00:39:31,589
system what are the default settings a

686
00:39:31,589 --> 00:39:34,880
you know it depends on what an axis
tight the timestamp is so in my

687
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:36,210
presentation we're going with

688
00:39:36,210 --> 00:39:40,269
an average user with a bball system and
this happens to be Windows XP

689
00:39:40,269 --> 00:39:45,109
given image video power the polar with
close access times no other images have

690
00:39:45,109 --> 00:39:48,609
similar access times on a concern image
video files are likely to be accessed

691
00:39:48,609 --> 00:39:52,920
were opened by a preview ring to rule
example Windows Explorer from the opera

692
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:53,559
previewing

693
00:39:53,559 --> 00:39:57,410
so now we have an answer why all the
prosecution with a access them

694
00:39:57,410 --> 00:40:00,799
the axis times are different from a from
the modified created

695
00:40:00,799 --> 00:40:04,150
and now we see well wait a minute there
a second apart

696
00:40:04,150 --> 00:40:07,630
and Weber said and somebody say anti
virus I've done caissons

697
00:40:07,630 --> 00:40:11,109
where the entire drive was minutes apart

698
00:40:11,109 --> 00:40:15,380
an anti virus has to access the file to
see if there's now wearing it

699
00:40:15,380 --> 00:40:19,509
so the axis state doesn't mean anything
then alright

700
00:40:19,509 --> 00:40:23,989
so abstract examination the system panel
comes BB trial

701
00:40:23,989 --> 00:40:27,549
located in the directory in question
supporting the use is a Windows Explorer

702
00:40:27,549 --> 00:40:31,550
access in the battle to get another fact
but let's go on from that

703
00:40:31,550 --> 00:40:36,700
what about filmstrip you right but I
gotta think like the prosecution

704
00:40:36,700 --> 00:40:41,190
subdirectories created by User do not
contain from strip you menu choice

705
00:40:41,190 --> 00:40:46,130
in the view our menu are each folder by
default so your parents know everybody

706
00:40:46,130 --> 00:40:49,770
else bill to be right law a little icon
down here big picture well maybe that's

707
00:40:49,770 --> 00:40:50,500
how he did it

708
00:40:50,500 --> 00:40:55,420
so I analyze the system well filmstrip
you

709
00:40:55,420 --> 00:40:59,100
is in in a deep albeit only in people
directory this is in a deep ball

710
00:40:59,100 --> 00:41:00,790
directly there for film strip you

711
00:41:00,790 --> 00:41:03,910
won't be there by default I should look
to see if it was there

712
00:41:03,910 --> 00:41:07,770
so it can be added let's go see if it
was added

713
00:41:07,770 --> 00:41:12,520
back to Boulder type problem was not on
the 8k you register keys

714
00:41:12,520 --> 00:41:15,700
so now we say I while we don't have to
go any further with

715
00:41:15,700 --> 00:41:19,270
filmstrip you because it wasn't in there
he nap filmstrip you were not

716
00:41:19,270 --> 00:41:24,420
got a fact possibility for you to view
the images by looking at the bottom

717
00:41:24,420 --> 00:41:25,320
mailed news

718
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:28,470
your

719
00:41:28,470 --> 00:41:32,330
okay it's a possibility let's look at
the reality that

720
00:41:32,330 --> 00:41:36,310
get there were five thousand images in a
folder what the possibility that the 10

721
00:41:36,310 --> 00:41:37,000
illegal ones

722
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:40,610
were viewed through thumbnail images to
who

723
00:41:40,610 --> 00:41:44,510
2007 percent if you can do the math
night

724
00:41:44,510 --> 00:41:48,900
and I've come up with that proposal you
the pink well if I'm are chirping porn

725
00:41:48,900 --> 00:41:50,380
and I end up with jobs

726
00:41:50,380 --> 00:41:54,170
two images and I got 10,000 on my
computer nobody ever price keeping for

727
00:41:54,170 --> 00:41:54,950
those two images

728
00:41:54,950 --> 00:42:01,790
think again might be evident that the
whole possibility possibility

729
00:42:01,790 --> 00:42:05,560
but the search history will show in 10
but because the way the program works

730
00:42:05,560 --> 00:42:08,350
for the singer the evidence we can't
provide a conclusion

731
00:42:08,350 --> 00:42:13,470
probability because they lack a file
named to the registry and not likely

732
00:42:13,470 --> 00:42:15,980
that the files were not accessed
recently iraq's a small

733
00:42:15,980 --> 00:42:19,580
the files could have not but could not
have been clearly future thumbnail

734
00:42:19,580 --> 00:42:20,160
images

735
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:24,390
and it's unlikely but they were
purposely beauty of looking at 2000 to

736
00:42:24,390 --> 00:42:25,120
present

737
00:42:25,120 --> 00:42:30,089
fact the evidence overcomes the beef
I'll supports the access times

738
00:42:30,090 --> 00:42:31,840
modification by Windows Explorer

739
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:34,890
black a prototype photo album in HK your
registry

740
00:42:34,890 --> 00:42:38,190
not a clue conclusion is that the father
not clearly viewed through Windows

741
00:42:38,190 --> 00:42:41,080
Explorer

742
00:42:41,080 --> 00:42:43,200
my expert opinion blah blah blah

743
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:46,200
so that's typically how place what we're

744
00:42:46,200 --> 00:42:50,670
I'll handle are a case right

745
00:42:50,670 --> 00:42:54,810
but talk about the costumes I'm in a
cheap air in the country

746
00:42:54,810 --> 00:42:59,310
you gonna get in trouble theater network
for says now and

747
00:42:59,310 --> 00:43:03,000
not better do it here typical case in my
area the country

748
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:06,380
willow green bay wisconsin but twenty
five thousand dollars because the give

749
00:43:06,380 --> 00:43:07,250
it goes to court

750
00:43:07,250 --> 00:43:12,920
expected report I'm that now there is a
country fifty two hundred thousand

751
00:43:12,920 --> 00:43:16,680
some places have exceeded two hundred
fifty thousand dollars now people's

752
00:43:16,680 --> 00:43:17,910
lives that are ruined

753
00:43:17,910 --> 00:43:21,520
that are innocent and there is no way
for them to recoup that money

754
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:25,550
which is why two years ago I said we
need a computer crime Innocence Project

755
00:43:25,550 --> 00:43:30,650
that's not the only thing happy with
time recent case I was a problem span

756
00:43:30,650 --> 00:43:31,590
one and a half years

757
00:43:31,590 --> 00:43:35,300
think about that you were in a Sen and
this is over your head for a year and a

758
00:43:35,300 --> 00:43:35,840
half

759
00:43:35,840 --> 00:43:40,640
or you're kinda guilty others I've been
involved with have spent three years

760
00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:43,868
Julia meryl case for Libyan dinar
premiere with that this was a

761
00:43:43,869 --> 00:43:45,040
schoolteacher

762
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:49,300
that had born pop up show up on your
screen and she was prosecuted

763
00:43:49,300 --> 00:43:54,550
and convicted her case lasted four years

764
00:43:54,550 --> 00:43:59,280
until finally some forensic experts came
to her defense

765
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:03,130
and said this the believe it or not

766
00:44:03,130 --> 00:44:07,700
that the program that the officer used
to analyze the computer the company that

767
00:44:07,700 --> 00:44:08,780
wrote that program said

768
00:44:08,780 --> 00:44:11,160
back programs not used for that

769
00:44:11,160 --> 00:44:15,020
they still prosecutor tonight

770
00:44:15,020 --> 00:44:18,960
your reputation a shot even if you're
innocent the damage your reputation can

771
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:19,950
be immeasurable

772
00:44:19,950 --> 00:44:24,070
again this is one of those crimes nobody
wants to deal with

773
00:44:24,070 --> 00:44:29,130
from a CP standpoint op you're guilty
until proven innocent

774
00:44:29,130 --> 00:44:32,590
annually and and sometimes people just
say well we never know

775
00:44:32,590 --> 00:44:36,200
that kinda guilty beyond pleased so
you're kinda Gilpin

776
00:44:36,200 --> 00:44:40,220
you move searched you search the
internet for porn you found some

777
00:44:40,220 --> 00:44:43,920
and you don't realize that you now have
illegal content on your drive

778
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:47,120
and someone finds the illegal content.
under drive

779
00:44:47,120 --> 00:44:50,529
now I doubt anybody in here would bring
your computer to Best Buy tablet quad

780
00:44:50,530 --> 00:44:51,370
fix it but

781
00:44:51,370 --> 00:44:55,370
if you did and they saw illegal content.
they're not calling you to pick up your

782
00:44:55,370 --> 00:44:56,109
computer

783
00:44:56,110 --> 00:44:59,730
the column the police alright I'm

784
00:44:59,730 --> 00:45:03,520
present I'm probation fined sex offender
registry list

785
00:45:03,520 --> 00:45:10,020
your life as you know it is over I'm
done I want to thank my college

appreciate that I wanna so it thank the

787
00:45:13,110 --> 00:45:14,220

788
00:45:14,220 --> 00:45:17,640
and I want to thank everybody I can't
lie to love it but the room is small

789
00:45:17,640 --> 00:45:22,049
I stayed out til midnight that was me
speak andar

790
00:45:22,050 --> 00:45:25,150
for some contact information and I'll
take questions

791
00:45:25,150 --> 00:45:32,150
mister

792
00:45:33,850 --> 00:45:39,060
I have not now but the question was have
I ever encountered a CP honey pot where

793
00:45:39,060 --> 00:45:39,630
there would be

794
00:45:39,630 --> 00:45:43,360
hashed values with collisions and I they
were but that did

795
00:45:43,360 --> 00:45:48,320
I'm no I have not they will not release
that database or for anybody to build

796
00:45:48,320 --> 00:45:49,900
that it would have to be the government

797
00:45:49,900 --> 00:45:53,160
and a government-wide can't believe
would want to build

798
00:45:53,160 --> 00:45:57,279
9 CP files that have the hash values
could that would do them any good in a

799
00:45:57,280 --> 00:45:58,170
prosecution

800
00:45:58,170 --> 00:46:04,290
bad that's very good

801
00:46:04,290 --> 00:46:08,750
the criminal examiner that fines that
pile

802
00:46:08,750 --> 00:46:11,810
real love you that file because they
type up a description

803
00:46:11,810 --> 00:46:15,620
and they would know now it's a it's a
hash collision so you shouldn't

804
00:46:15,620 --> 00:46:19,069
have anything to worry about if they're
not doing their job

805
00:46:19,070 --> 00:46:22,500
yes there in case program is looking at

806
00:46:22,500 --> 00:46:25,810
the dash database and it got a built-in
description

807
00:46:25,810 --> 00:46:29,750
and they never knew it you what happened
then have somebody you and not

808
00:46:29,750 --> 00:46:35,300
bring something up I don't view the
images that somebody else's job

809
00:46:35,300 --> 00:46:42,300
so up there with the hash collision now
now it's up more primitive think about

810
00:46:48,300 --> 00:46:51,620
the in my state it happened probably the

811
00:46:51,620 --> 00:46:56,250
it was the last poets federal to do it
but then lost child protection act

812
00:46:56,250 --> 00:46:59,690
the Adam Walsh child protection act but
that arm

813
00:46:59,690 --> 00:47:03,310
know is that two years ago are more like
four and a half for five years ago

814
00:47:03,310 --> 00:47:06,480
five years ago I was getting drives in
the state of Wisconsin okay

815
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:11,570
so many cases it no matter what room no
matter what the rule about

816
00:47:11,570 --> 00:47:16,050
turn about expert says you know can get
the drive not anymore

817
00:47:16,050 --> 00:47:19,940
not even require protection yeah me too
I well

818
00:47:19,940 --> 00:47:24,430
right now time for CB on the reason for
it is they don't want Bay

819
00:47:24,430 --> 00:47:28,190
there there and in the end I was just
called to testify

820
00:47:28,190 --> 00:47:31,400
and I used I look it up

821
00:47:31,400 --> 00:47:34,820
prosecutors I should say the examiner's
report

822
00:47:34,820 --> 00:47:39,570
and the examiner's report said we can
conduct an analysis

823
00:47:39,570 --> 00:47:42,970
at the home obv not defendant

824
00:47:42,970 --> 00:47:46,980
because we need special equipment to
analyze the computer

825
00:47:46,980 --> 00:47:50,840
so I took all the quotes but said the
police are going to do an analysis at

826
00:47:50,840 --> 00:47:51,510
their home

827
00:47:51,510 --> 00:47:54,770
and I gave them to the attorney to tell
to the judge

828
00:47:54,770 --> 00:47:58,640
I can't do it at the crime lab I gotta
do it in my lap

829
00:47:58,640 --> 00:48:02,650
and the judge wouldn't hear he in fact a
they held a arm

830
00:48:02,650 --> 00:48:07,010
I I'm I can't remember what it's called

831
00:48:07,010 --> 00:48:10,870
I'm but I was ready get ready to testify
and ready to be called

832
00:48:10,870 --> 00:48:13,890
and he said no we're not doing it any
told the prosecutor

833
00:48:13,890 --> 00:48:17,600
you will give them everything they need
and he told the attorney you will do you

834
00:48:17,600 --> 00:48:19,290
in your expert will do everything you
need

835
00:48:19,290 --> 00:48:22,400
at the Department criminal
investigations had to be there

836
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:25,540
mister how often you have federal cases
versus

837
00:48:25,540 --> 00:48:29,320
I have never had a federal case I am
told when I went down to the crime lab I

838
00:48:29,320 --> 00:48:30,390
was nervous I'm a

839
00:48:30,390 --> 00:48:34,480
I met a a I told the attorneys I'm never
done an analysis at the Department a

840
00:48:34,480 --> 00:48:36,890
criminal investigator had no idea what's
gonna happen

841
00:48:36,890 --> 00:48:41,299
well I showed up an hour days it's going
to be behind me no am I gonna have to

842
00:48:41,300 --> 00:48:43,390
sit there worry about every key I type

843
00:48:43,390 --> 00:48:47,359
I am and he set up the room for me and
said

844
00:48:47,360 --> 00:48:50,740
is that chair okay would you like a more
comfortable chair like a hour since

845
00:48:50,740 --> 00:48:54,400
is not unlike what I thought I was gonna
be I said you're not gonna stay in here

846
00:48:54,400 --> 00:48:55,540
with me said no

847
00:48:55,540 --> 00:48:59,180
but if it was a federal crime the FBI
decent behind use of

848
00:48:59,180 --> 00:49:02,190
actually wouldn't they be sitting in the
next room not really

849
00:49:02,190 --> 00:49:05,170
and if you were with the attorney they
wouldn't be allowed to listen tere

850
00:49:05,170 --> 00:49:07,530
conversations your conversations had
work done

851
00:49:07,530 --> 00:49:10,540
ninety percent federal cases in a large
is

852
00:49:10,540 --> 00:49:16,550
and it's really pathetic for current
status darren has led to run a defense

853
00:49:16,550 --> 00:49:18,620
know the policing is usually pretty good

854
00:49:18,620 --> 00:49:22,140
I'm but I've only testified once in all
these cases

855
00:49:22,140 --> 00:49:25,950
and I was disqualified as an expert in
child pornography because I perceive no

856
00:49:25,950 --> 00:49:27,610
formal training in the subject

857
00:49:27,610 --> 00:49:30,890
who that everything

858
00:49:30,890 --> 00:49:34,529
as it turned out and Harvard University
wasn't offering the course that

859
00:49:34,530 --> 00:49:39,150
here I and no one can get formal
training in the subject so we created a

860
00:49:39,150 --> 00:49:40,470
class a forbidden

861
00:49:40,470 --> 00:49:43,510
knowledge here where you can to research
in

862
00:49:43,510 --> 00:49:49,200
and questions like viewing child porn a
gateway to abusing actual children

863
00:49:49,200 --> 00:49:55,960
for thank you just one observation that
you mention earlier about the file name

864
00:49:55,960 --> 00:49:57,140
coming out sweetheart

865
00:49:57,140 --> 00:50:00,180
on I file sharing service eDonkey

866
00:50:00,180 --> 00:50:03,970
when you run a search it actually polls
to the metadata

867
00:50:03,970 --> 00:50:09,170
of the pulse the shared files not the
actual file name so unless you right

868
00:50:09,170 --> 00:50:12,810
click on the tab and shit see the file
name that will be downloaded

869
00:50:12,810 --> 00:50:15,870
that's why you're going to wind up
potentially with the day

870
00:50:15,870 --> 00:50:20,720
more explicit its a file named
downloaded than you would see in your

871
00:50:20,720 --> 00:50:21,880
search results

872
00:50:21,880 --> 00:50:26,340
%ah okay because you have to actually
says right click on their property serv

873
00:50:26,340 --> 00:50:30,870
share it actually see what files gonna
come down and whatever dude is gonna do

874
00:50:30,870 --> 00:50:31,339
that

875
00:50:31,340 --> 00:50:35,500
I barry you their own now sir

876
00:50:35,500 --> 00:50:39,300
yes so my question is you talk about

877
00:50:39,300 --> 00:50:42,400
up whatever you investigate is based on
the average user

878
00:50:42,400 --> 00:50:45,600
issue saying that the person who's not
the average users tryna

879
00:50:45,600 --> 00:50:49,120
hide it get away with know what I was
saying is that the reason I was going

880
00:50:49,120 --> 00:50:49,600
through

881
00:50:49,600 --> 00:50:52,970
on the screen is going to be based on
the average injured because

882
00:50:52,970 --> 00:50:56,380
if I come out here and I say I have this
is now the scenes

883
00:50:56,380 --> 00:50:59,690
probably twenty people in the audience
they could say yeah but what about

884
00:50:59,690 --> 00:51:03,930
if they did bob is Gretchen robotic
answers too many variables

885
00:51:03,930 --> 00:51:07,730
for me to give a talk so that's why
please I was talking about their

886
00:51:07,730 --> 00:51:10,890
that's what I was talking to analyze
everything I am rising in

887
00:51:10,890 --> 00:51:14,660
X by the way one comment about access
times which is that the a lot of the

888
00:51:14,660 --> 00:51:15,399
pier to Pier

889
00:51:15,400 --> 00:51:19,200
file sharing programs update the access
times also when a down day I'll serve

890
00:51:19,200 --> 00:51:19,640
out

891
00:51:19,640 --> 00:51:23,230
the file now as in the process of
downloading they're also serving it

892
00:51:23,230 --> 00:51:26,490
so you might end up getting charged with
distribution yeah

893
00:51:26,490 --> 00:51:32,090
as a consequence as a side effect it
down so I'll

894
00:51:32,090 --> 00:51:35,130
the talk about hashes surprising to me

895
00:51:35,130 --> 00:51:38,740
um is that something that's only being
done by the police

896
00:51:38,740 --> 00:51:43,210
in the cases where the file sharing
service actually uses hashes on the back

897
00:51:43,210 --> 00:51:44,490
and in some way

898
00:51:44,490 --> 00:51:48,080
worst that just their way of identifying
problem files

899
00:51:48,080 --> 00:51:51,270
because if so I mean it seems like it's
trivially easy to

900
00:51:51,270 --> 00:51:54,460
modify one but not violent completely
change Attash

901
00:51:54,460 --> 00:51:58,400
ride the database and UTI your on both
ends

902
00:51:58,400 --> 00:52:02,570
so Prime Ticket I i've heard a lot of
people tell me that the criminal

903
00:52:02,570 --> 00:52:05,820
on database are child pornography
passions

904
00:52:05,820 --> 00:52:09,880
is not up to date it's not very good and
then but I see it in the reports that

905
00:52:09,880 --> 00:52:11,630
they're using the hash database

906
00:52:11,630 --> 00:52:15,060
and it in fact I'll take other files
innocent other files

907
00:52:15,060 --> 00:52:19,130
to the whenever lab to have them really
analyze them

908
00:52:19,130 --> 00:52:26,130
and added to the hash database

909
00:52:26,160 --> 00:52:30,390
I had a quick question regarding
actually thing you said a sec ago

910
00:52:30,390 --> 00:52:33,710
was website knows view the encryption
arm

911
00:52:33,710 --> 00:52:37,310
so it's a do something that I was
disturbed

912
00:52:37,310 --> 00:52:41,299
it was unusable a few with a few months
back about the I'm case where the person

913
00:52:41,300 --> 00:52:42,270
was

914
00:52:42,270 --> 00:52:46,440
arm held in contempt of court there
forever for not giving up the past which

915
00:52:46,440 --> 00:52:47,700
was TrueCrypt

916
00:52:47,700 --> 00:52:50,840
interrupted our hard drive arm

917
00:52:50,840 --> 00:52:53,910
iris is trying to your liking I'm

918
00:52:53,910 --> 00:52:57,200
is I'd buy a knowledgeable or was in is
obviously not

919
00:52:57,200 --> 00:53:01,960
your legal or not and oversight all but
I mean does that mean that if I E

920
00:53:01,960 --> 00:53:05,790
do i improve my hard drive right were
some awesome trip so hard drive

921
00:53:05,790 --> 00:53:09,279
that army could be held in contempt of
court until we give it up

922
00:53:09,280 --> 00:53:13,050
I'm not a lawyer yeah

923
00:53:13,050 --> 00:53:16,350
can help your I there was the talk
earlier dollar you wouldn't want to be

924
00:53:16,350 --> 00:53:18,029
terribly at da

925
00:53:18,030 --> 00:53:23,430
I'm he kinda covered that stuff there is
an earlier question about hashing and I

926
00:53:23,430 --> 00:53:24,960
was wondering if

927
00:53:24,960 --> 00:53:28,800
any sort of perceptual hashing is use
similar to shizz am

928
00:53:28,800 --> 00:53:31,820
or the way you to detect copyrighted
videos

929
00:53:31,820 --> 00:53:35,740
or if it's just purely a you know surely
impurity

930
00:53:35,740 --> 00:53:39,780
for me it's an md5 hash a shower
national K do you do you suspect that

931
00:53:39,780 --> 00:53:41,240
they will be moving to

932
00:53:41,240 --> 00:53:45,670
or at least police or prosecutors will
be moving sis that's our system

933
00:53:45,670 --> 00:53:49,770
anytime I'm scared they moved barely
slow so I doubt you have information on

934
00:53:49,770 --> 00:53:50,060
a

935
00:53:50,060 --> 00:53:53,330
I can tell you about the hash database
the National Center for Missing and

936
00:53:53,330 --> 00:53:55,060
Exploited Children ich mache

937
00:53:55,060 --> 00:53:58,549
is that designated reporting agency for
child porn

938
00:53:58,550 --> 00:54:01,760
and they haven't known victim database
some these

939
00:54:01,760 --> 00:54:04,960
images the victims in it in it her

940
00:54:04,960 --> 00:54:08,520
five years old and they're now
grandmothers be which

941
00:54:08,520 --> 00:54:12,520
this whole thing a designer because the
home is actually cause when they're told

942
00:54:12,520 --> 00:54:16,390
that their image has surfaced once again
it's not caused by the viewing at the

943
00:54:16,390 --> 00:54:17,259
image by

944
00:54:17,260 --> 00:54:20,630
pointing it out to them so I am you know

945
00:54:20,630 --> 00:54:25,380
this is shared between Interpol and and
neck neck and it's generally

946
00:54:25,380 --> 00:54:29,960
distributed among police agencies
applied

947
00:54:29,960 --> 00:54:33,590
stop thank you web doc

948
00:54:33,590 --> 00:54:37,940
one more go ahead know what is the ETA
gone out there's nobody happening

949
00:54:37,940 --> 00:54:41,300
how do you protect yourself from sure a
follow-on

950
00:54:41,300 --> 00:54:44,700
prosecution because in the case

951
00:54:44,700 --> 00:54:49,840
where you are from emulating a search if
you got any that Nelson your computer

952
00:54:49,840 --> 00:54:53,910
how do you get yourself into a safe zone
mercer's hang on this is a legitimate

953
00:54:53,910 --> 00:54:55,330
defense research

954
00:54:55,330 --> 00:54:58,350
in you shouldn't be prosecuted for

955
00:54:58,350 --> 00:55:02,140
doing your job in this case you have to
prove and I and that what a great

956
00:55:02,140 --> 00:55:03,370
question and

957
00:55:03,370 --> 00:55:06,430
don't work BFF and Mike

958
00:55:06,430 --> 00:55:10,710
conducted now where research that bad

959
00:55:10,710 --> 00:55:15,540
I what I wanted to prove what I wanted
to do I want to try to write my paper

960
00:55:15,540 --> 00:55:18,640
I'm how you would prove malware

961
00:55:18,640 --> 00:55:22,319
downloaded illegal content. you died in
your download illegal content.

962
00:55:22,320 --> 00:55:26,030
but I told my college if I in fact this
system

963
00:55:26,030 --> 00:55:30,280
there's the potential but it downloads
illegal content.

964
00:55:30,280 --> 00:55:33,780
and I need butter the college to know
that

965
00:55:33,780 --> 00:55:37,400
and and we have to come up with a method
to make sure that

966
00:55:37,400 --> 00:55:40,720
I don't get prosecuted in its taken care
and

967
00:55:40,720 --> 00:55:43,850
what about your paper turn he said as
well that gets internet

968
00:55:43,850 --> 00:55:47,560
that knowingly so you have to be able to
prove

969
00:55:47,560 --> 00:55:52,330
that you didn't knowingly download it
and you didn't knowingly view it

970
00:55:52,330 --> 00:55:56,490
now I can do that forensically but just
imagine

971
00:55:56,490 --> 00:56:00,250
having to get an analyst that's gonna
prove that

972
00:56:00,250 --> 00:56:05,070
when when the when are the are
prosecutors expert is going to just go

973
00:56:05,070 --> 00:56:05,830
off

974
00:56:05,830 --> 00:56:11,799
file time date stamps so I don't think
there's anything that you can do

975
00:56:11,800 --> 00:56:15,210
sorry sorry word on American thanks

976
00:56:15,210 --> 00:56:15,740
thanks very much
