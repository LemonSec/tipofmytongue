1
00:00:00,049 --> 00:00:03,449
that were here representing I key to
that bounce

2
00:00:03,449 --> 00:00:08,130
which is a humanitarian

3
00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:11,780
a incubator for humanitarian response
and

4
00:00:11,780 --> 00:00:16,160
I'm willow I'm digs and procure

5
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:23,160
love um DVI to VGA adapters and when we
reverse this talk earlier

6
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:27,279
it was pretty amazing so we're hoping it
holds

7
00:00:27,279 --> 00:00:32,250
I'm things stuff okay so for small
personal problems

8
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:35,520
with a lot of different stuff a we have
a lot of fun drinking water

9
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:39,809
a puzzles and building 100 cool things
and playing with our phones

10
00:00:39,809 --> 00:00:43,540
and it's fun and we live in a really
blast and cool world

11
00:00:43,540 --> 00:00:47,550
I am but we can also apply those skills
sets

12
00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:50,739
to other things I don't you tell us
about the sticks

13
00:00:50,739 --> 00:00:54,420
i'm glad you asked me that well um

14
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:58,910
so up back in alt start as far back as
2001

15
00:00:58,910 --> 00:01:02,820
on 9/11 on there is a the

16
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:05,970
tsunami in the Indian Ocean there was
the IOM

17
00:01:05,970 --> 00:01:09,010
Hurricane Katrina arm these

18
00:01:09,010 --> 00:01:12,180
events happens at I watch them as

19
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:18,009
as many vested Tom and I felt kinda
paralyze I want to do something when

20
00:01:18,009 --> 00:01:21,549
when the Hurricane Katrina I was glued
to a

21
00:01:21,549 --> 00:01:25,119
a LiveJournal fee does anybody remember
LiveJournal as

22
00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:28,470
like prefect is like pre myspace

23
00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:32,500
um she has

24
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:37,079
as um so of some some guys I knew that
lived in

25
00:01:37,079 --> 00:01:40,750
on in CNN New Orleans had a

26
00:01:40,750 --> 00:01:44,820
they are trying p and as the hurricane
came in

27
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:48,090
are starting to come and they prepared
and they got their generators for the

28
00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:48,909
diesel fuel

29
00:01:48,909 --> 00:01:53,689
and I'm after the hurricane blew through
they still had power and and we're

30
00:01:53,689 --> 00:01:54,689
live-blogging

31
00:01:54,689 --> 00:01:57,850
on livejournal about what was going on
an

32
00:01:57,850 --> 00:02:01,899
Tim to me and it's certain point they're
getting like two thousand hits

33
00:02:01,899 --> 00:02:05,119
arm a minute on their

34
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:09,330
your LiveJournal are because they were
the only people that had access to

35
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:12,370
information on the ground and this
completely started

36
00:02:12,370 --> 00:02:16,379
naturally started directing and we need
water over here in this Addison you know

37
00:02:16,379 --> 00:02:17,319
way before

38
00:02:17,319 --> 00:02:21,500
on state or federal 8 started coming in
hand

39
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:24,310
I thought that was really cool and I
sorta germinating this idea in my head

40
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:24,780
that

41
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:29,819
you know maybe we can harness that
natural passion for problem solving that

42
00:02:29,819 --> 00:02:33,459
that geeks have arm for something other
than

43
00:02:33,459 --> 00:02:36,879
playing World of Warcraft week it may be
do some some good

44
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:39,899
world and and so I

45
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:44,450
kinda naively got in front of a couple
conferences and said hey we should just

46
00:02:44,450 --> 00:02:45,810
save the world with peak power

47
00:02:45,810 --> 00:02:49,900
and will kinda called me out on issues
like so high

48
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:53,010
do that because it kinda sounds like a
great idea

49
00:02:53,010 --> 00:02:57,420
but om you didn't really say how you're
going to do that

50
00:02:57,420 --> 00:03:00,900
so so anyway we started talking and
decided

51
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:05,269
kinda join forces in and see if we can
figure out how to do it

52
00:03:05,269 --> 00:03:09,440
well done I like well

53
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:12,609
I I perfer stark but that's it okay

54
00:03:12,610 --> 00:03:15,849
so a.m. we're all pretty aware a

55
00:03:15,849 --> 00:03:19,879
traditional response organizations on
the time to have red logos

56
00:03:19,879 --> 00:03:22,879
and they tend to have a lot to do with
children on

57
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:27,640
they also do a lot of good work and
their very established they understand

58
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:28,330
the environment

59
00:03:28,330 --> 00:03:31,810
understand what they're doing are what
the needs are with the parameters are

60
00:03:31,810 --> 00:03:32,640
things like that

61
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:37,060
a.m. as an example of how many of these
organizations they are

62
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:40,659
there are a after

63
00:03:40,659 --> 00:03:44,829
the Indian Ocean tsunami 600
organizations responded

64
00:03:44,830 --> 00:03:48,099
in the first six weeks that's still a
lot

65
00:03:48,099 --> 00:03:51,610
like that that's a fair number that's
not just individuals and organizations

66
00:03:51,610 --> 00:03:56,030
have to juggle in contrast after port a
prince

67
00:03:56,030 --> 00:04:00,120
which is the Haitian earthquake there
were four thousand in the first

68
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:03,299
days massive

69
00:04:03,299 --> 00:04:07,280
okay so here's one representation %uh
what that looks like that there's a

70
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:11,260
linked to an awesome presentation on
this that I'll share with you later

71
00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:16,290
a.m. this is store does we started
filling in the logos but that orange

72
00:04:16,290 --> 00:04:17,780
triad orange square

73
00:04:17,780 --> 00:04:20,940
on the upper left is pretty safe word

74
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:25,729
for please don't add anything else I'm
so this is how far we got and not all

75
00:04:25,729 --> 00:04:26,930
these are from

76
00:04:26,930 --> 00:04:31,259
port a prince or after but they're there
called digital humanitarian

77
00:04:31,259 --> 00:04:35,270
organizations and to do

78
00:04:35,270 --> 00:04:39,109
so all these groups have to worry about
a lot of different things and as the

79
00:04:39,110 --> 00:04:40,360
infrastructure that their

80
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:44,530
operating on even exist is there enough
bandwidth is there enough power

81
00:04:44,530 --> 00:04:48,120
what is the government structure like
what all are you worries

82
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:53,229
is culturally appropriate will people
even use it do they care is it necessary

83
00:04:53,229 --> 00:04:57,750
and is it approved by the participating
organizations are you just sweeping in

84
00:04:57,750 --> 00:05:01,060
undercutting them and trying to get
information the people only wanna give

85
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:02,250
want

86
00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:07,150
so as you can see there are a lot of
things at play

87
00:05:07,150 --> 00:05:11,440
on there was a great example earlier
today

88
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:15,139
from the technology to change society
things to not do

89
00:05:15,139 --> 00:05:19,300
about how there is even or a wiki that
people wanted

90
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:24,449
the local community really wanted the
technology existed and yet

91
00:05:24,449 --> 00:05:27,770
it wasn't quite right and so it didn't
work

92
00:05:27,770 --> 00:05:33,359
so even when you think everything is a
line sometimes it doesn't work

93
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:38,509
but it's still worth the effort because
this is democratizing things in a very

94
00:05:38,509 --> 00:05:39,669
new way

95
00:05:39,669 --> 00:05:42,770
people on the ground people in his
community suddenly have the ability to

96
00:05:42,770 --> 00:05:44,389
speak for themselves

97
00:05:44,389 --> 00:05:48,100
in a way that we haven't had the ability
to listen to them he'd been speaking but

98
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:48,860
we can't

99
00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:52,400
here and and it's flattening access

100
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:56,699
so it's not just white dude in keep
showing up I found solution to your

101
00:05:56,699 --> 00:05:58,490
problem there are no solutions

102
00:05:58,490 --> 00:06:01,620
also white guys in capes muster and
Raiders

103
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:06,870
highness edgy and this has a lot of
really cool

104
00:06:06,870 --> 00:06:10,210
potential and it also opens up the
gateway for

105
00:06:10,210 --> 00:06:13,799
new communities we can close the digital
divide in close other

106
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:20,020
discrepancies in so sick class other
fancy words that I learned in college

107
00:06:20,020 --> 00:06:24,340
but in the at the end of the day anyone
can participate but should

108
00:06:24,340 --> 00:06:28,250
day is a massive learning curve is it
worth closing that

109
00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:32,830
when there's a disaster and we worry
about documentation

110
00:06:32,830 --> 00:06:36,330
and continuation is it possible to him
these

111
00:06:36,330 --> 00:06:41,639
is wearing holding the mic okay I'm
sorry I also speak really quickly

112
00:06:41,639 --> 00:06:45,610
and documentation and continuation

113
00:06:45,610 --> 00:06:49,849
how is this being handed off because
people keep really compassionate and

114
00:06:49,849 --> 00:06:53,440
fault when things are there shittiest

115
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:57,630
and then they go away and you have all
this code and if you think

116
00:06:57,630 --> 00:07:00,719
on commented code for work

117
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:04,360
is bad it right you don't even know what
it's supposed to do you just know it was

118
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:07,169
supposed to link these two things
together and save

119
00:07:07,169 --> 00:07:10,810
lives where the even thinking what which
is

120
00:07:10,810 --> 00:07:14,940
its it gets bad and you also have to
worry about security

121
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:19,190
a especially a change open source and
share things everyone should know what's

122
00:07:19,190 --> 00:07:20,169
going on

123
00:07:20,169 --> 00:07:23,979
I'm refugees are refugees for reason

124
00:07:23,979 --> 00:07:28,479
there going away from some and if you're
asking them to contribute more

125
00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:31,250
information so that you can make sure
that they're checking

126
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:34,419
loved one you know where people are
missing and all this other stuff if that

127
00:07:34,419 --> 00:07:36,318
information even be triangulated

128
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:39,490
cross reference with other datasets your

129
00:07:39,490 --> 00:07:44,550
putting actual people risk and that is
unacceptable

130
00:07:44,550 --> 00:07:47,930
so we run into this thing where in
software were taught to release

131
00:07:47,930 --> 00:07:52,090
early in release of in and fill fast and
Phil Hart feel pass a bill Hart

132
00:07:52,090 --> 00:07:56,710
totally good but do so when you're
closed environment

133
00:07:56,710 --> 00:08:01,699
do so at the consent of the other people
that are using what your building

134
00:08:01,699 --> 00:08:07,259
saudis they don't know what what risk
you're putting them in the whales

135
00:08:07,259 --> 00:08:11,650
but we can't deal with this and it's
worthwhile to do so

136
00:08:11,650 --> 00:08:15,770
with the green arrow okay so wanna
things to deal with these

137
00:08:15,770 --> 00:08:18,979
huge group we showed you would

138
00:08:18,979 --> 00:08:22,349
with orange square on is

139
00:08:22,349 --> 00:08:26,440
to work together all these groups are
very specific in what they do and people

140
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:28,819
sign up to those groups because they
flip

141
00:08:28,819 --> 00:08:32,890
culture in it that their ideals and then
those groups working together

142
00:08:32,890 --> 00:08:35,949
make it possible to make a meta object

143
00:08:35,950 --> 00:08:39,039
response so what you did

144
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:42,519
traditional response communities there's
a group called that hope which

145
00:08:42,519 --> 00:08:45,570
overseas a lot of different
organizations and

146
00:08:45,570 --> 00:08:49,709
some unease group I'm not OK with from
some of them I am

147
00:08:49,709 --> 00:08:52,589
but what really matters is at the end of
the day we can all sit down and talk to

148
00:08:52,589 --> 00:08:53,050
each other

149
00:08:53,050 --> 00:08:56,370
figure out what it is raining foreign
how weekend

150
00:08:56,370 --> 00:08:59,500
not get in the way each other

151
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:03,160
and call each other helped to when it
comes down to it

152
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:07,500
am and then there's digital humanitarian

153
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:10,580
where that's huge group and that

154
00:09:10,580 --> 00:09:13,760
plus close Prince is our group

155
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:16,839
because it's pretty

156
00:09:16,839 --> 00:09:20,920
and for other reasons mysle on so random
acts of kindness is a by

157
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:26,199
yearly hackathon that mostly developers
but also some hackers and hardware

158
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:28,630
hackers

159
00:09:28,630 --> 00:09:32,800
designers arm

160
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:36,529
get together and they gather around what
I call challenges upon definitions that

161
00:09:36,529 --> 00:09:38,750
subject matter experts bring to the
table

162
00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:41,440
these are some things that we've been
facing people have a concerted effort

163
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:42,730
over the weekend

164
00:09:42,730 --> 00:09:46,370
passion and they come up with a believe

165
00:09:46,370 --> 00:09:50,230
a prototyped works for the for
presentation time

166
00:09:50,230 --> 00:09:53,680
right we all know about this it works
for that one time and it doesn't work

167
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:54,760
again

168
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:57,760
and so what our group does is

169
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:01,450
if you want to continue that into a
business that sustains you

170
00:10:01,450 --> 00:10:05,730
or you wanna trade nonprofit or whatever
else would mentorship

171
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:09,890
explain more later on social coding for
good as a part an attack

172
00:10:09,890 --> 00:10:13,040
and Ace if you just have a few hours
during your week

173
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:16,949
order your month they match up your
skill set in your time availability

174
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:20,010
to organizations that need those things

175
00:10:20,010 --> 00:10:24,319
their fantastic and we're together
creating this way that

176
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:27,709
anyone regardless of what your
background is we'll figure out a way for

177
00:10:27,709 --> 00:10:28,820
you to engage

178
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:32,149
with its healthy for everyone involved
or at least less

179
00:10:32,149 --> 00:10:36,010
wrong

180
00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:40,040
we have also done things

181
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:43,420
I can talk about this because I know
what we've done arm

182
00:10:43,420 --> 00:10:46,949
so a lot of the work that we've done
over the past

183
00:10:46,950 --> 00:10:51,300
oMG two years since since we started he
said %uh pounds actually coming up in

184
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:52,060
two years

185
00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:55,940
we started it on 10-10-10 cuz it was
really key date

186
00:10:55,940 --> 00:10:58,980
om and a is

187
00:10:58,980 --> 00:11:03,010
story to use that and um

188
00:11:03,010 --> 00:11:08,050
so um one of the things that we did you
actually this this project we keep your

189
00:11:08,050 --> 00:11:09,000
started before

190
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:13,110
key to the bouncer even launched om me
and a friend of mine were

191
00:11:13,110 --> 00:11:15,470
said around scratching their heads
trying to figure out what weather was

192
00:11:15,470 --> 00:11:16,550
good for

193
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:21,170
and com I want to a conference in here
in New York actually cut the 140

194
00:11:21,170 --> 00:11:22,420
characters conference

195
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:26,329
ands was kinda

196
00:11:26,329 --> 00:11:29,420
it the same weekend like a week before
the conference was

197
00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:34,279
om the Canada all hell has broken loose
in Iran

198
00:11:34,279 --> 00:11:37,519
and the you know

199
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:41,680
the internet got shut down the kick

200
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:45,630
yeah now i'm talking about. while that
happens next but now

201
00:11:45,630 --> 00:11:51,760
I'm still talking about this one um
thanks for the

202
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:57,420
um but a but anyway I got back in and
Osaka my body in order like wow you know

203
00:11:57,420 --> 00:12:01,000
Twitter's kinda you know where has been
through Facebook

204
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,190
in MySpace and I just couldn't figure
out what we need another and other

205
00:12:04,190 --> 00:12:06,070
social media platform for

206
00:12:06,070 --> 00:12:09,370
arm and as we're literally as we're
talking about this is two police

207
00:12:09,370 --> 00:12:10,940
officers go racing by

208
00:12:10,940 --> 00:12:14,279
and/or like I wonder where they're going
we look up arm

209
00:12:14,279 --> 00:12:18,360
honor on to city website we find that
there's a police data feed all the

210
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:20,060
active calls it goes through

211
00:12:20,060 --> 00:12:22,920
the problem with the data feeders is you
know it's got information about like the

212
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:23,500
date

213
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:26,750
and the type of call that somebody
called into the police but it

214
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:30,329
it you had to be watching it like we're
looking on the screen for like an hour

215
00:12:30,329 --> 00:12:31,950
trying to see

216
00:12:31,950 --> 00:12:35,490
like that information that we were
looking for scroll by

217
00:12:35,490 --> 00:12:38,540
and our like this is disc this is could
be

218
00:12:38,540 --> 00:12:42,750
made so much more useful and so we just
took the data feed

219
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:46,820
and instead I love Ste no scrolling it
on a web page we create a Twitter

220
00:12:46,820 --> 00:12:47,279
account

221
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:50,380
Nate tweet out om the the

222
00:12:50,380 --> 00:12:53,910
that active calls and you can just
subscribed your neighborhood so if you

223
00:12:53,910 --> 00:12:54,529
wanna get

224
00:12:54,529 --> 00:12:58,389
a text message without actually
installing any additional stuff free to

225
00:12:58,389 --> 00:12:59,610
subscribe to a Twitter account

226
00:12:59,610 --> 00:13:02,680
in subscribe to your local neighborhood
and I

227
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:06,680
you can get information about break-ins
ur for crimes that are happening in your

228
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:08,300
local neighborhood we also have stuff

229
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:12,410
for our weather alerts and we're also
working with other cities now

230
00:13:12,410 --> 00:13:16,170
has been expanding we just expanded to
the county and

231
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:19,440
in seattle is also get ready to launch
in Seattle's well

232
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:23,190
so arm but this is like a a very simple
word

233
00:13:23,190 --> 00:13:27,470
in Noida crisis mappers her crisis
mapping

234
00:13:27,470 --> 00:13:30,550
so this is a very simple version a
crisis man is basically

235
00:13:30,550 --> 00:13:33,700
taking incidents that happened and you
put them on a map

236
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:38,100
and you can create heat maps out a bit
when there's a big crisis or

237
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:41,889
like seen that in the cases earthquake
in Haiti you can really see were eight

238
00:13:41,889 --> 00:13:42,649
minutes ago

239
00:13:42,649 --> 00:13:46,470
first or what type of eighties to go
where

240
00:13:46,470 --> 00:13:50,839
om this was another project at came up
shortly thereafter

241
00:13:50,839 --> 00:13:54,260
on this was directly in response to the

242
00:13:54,260 --> 00:13:57,600
the january twenty-fifth

243
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:01,279
uprising in Egypt the government shut
off the internet

244
00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:04,310
and so some friends in mind

245
00:14:04,310 --> 00:14:07,850
up because we launched abound can touch
it means that he can least

246
00:14:07,850 --> 00:14:11,949
do something to help so we set up the
phone numbers people could call

247
00:14:11,949 --> 00:14:16,350
ands I leave a message and those
messages were then put into a Twitter

248
00:14:16,350 --> 00:14:17,040
feed

249
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:20,810
and volunteers to go to the Twitter feed
listen to a message in transcribing this

250
00:14:20,810 --> 00:14:21,930
is actually the

251
00:14:21,930 --> 00:14:26,050
did screen share the Google Doc to get
set up almond so

252
00:14:26,050 --> 00:14:30,170
the first in yellow there is the the
Arabic transcription

253
00:14:30,170 --> 00:14:34,769
and then arm as you go down you see the
you know English translation and then

254
00:14:34,769 --> 00:14:37,740
they had other volunteers translated
into German and French in

255
00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:41,579
so every tweet that every message to get
left on the phone line was getting

256
00:14:41,579 --> 00:14:45,180
re tweeted out twenty times over because
it was being translated transcribed in

257
00:14:45,180 --> 00:14:48,290
multiple languages

258
00:14:48,290 --> 00:14:53,579
om this one will work done you can talk
about this

259
00:14:53,579 --> 00:14:56,550
okay so that's why it's called mad which
is mobile assessment of damage for the

260
00:14:56,550 --> 00:14:58,380
public

261
00:14:58,380 --> 00:15:01,709
when a disaster blows through your town

262
00:15:01,709 --> 00:15:06,000
you can't San X you can get federal aid

263
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,329
you've all heard about federal aid being
called into your to your county

264
00:15:09,329 --> 00:15:14,800
rain your county s 72 hours to assess
how much damage is happened

265
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:18,790
as a percentage what the value of the
county is analyst other stuff

266
00:15:18,790 --> 00:15:22,329
they figure out if they get federal
eight or nine the thing is

267
00:15:22,329 --> 00:15:25,440
here's their process they call your
landline

268
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:31,380
who has a land line who's had a land
line in the past two years

269
00:15:31,380 --> 00:15:34,949
okay so if they can't get ahold

270
00:15:34,949 --> 00:15:38,120
EVA Air landline they go and knock on
your door

271
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:41,300
and then someone fills out a form with
head

272
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:44,649
and then faxes it into someone who does
data entry

273
00:15:44,649 --> 00:15:48,899
who then figures out if you qualify for
federal assistance or even if your whole

274
00:15:48,899 --> 00:15:49,550
camp

275
00:15:49,550 --> 00:15:52,560
72 hours said

276
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:56,149
surround do that I we figure it out well
just

277
00:15:56,149 --> 00:15:59,339
side do

278
00:15:59,339 --> 00:16:02,600
data entry on the front and so people
can uses my phone

279
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:06,750
phone tree they can text didn't they can
use a web portal whatever means they can

280
00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:08,070
get to it by

281
00:16:08,070 --> 00:16:11,230
is fine you buy the land mine if they
want to

282
00:16:11,230 --> 00:16:15,540
and and it takes care of all the other
stuff on the back end

283
00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:19,689
because we've been talking to people at
the County Emergency Management

284
00:16:19,690 --> 00:16:22,920
were able to actually deploy this it's
going to take them

285
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:26,529
few years it'll have far before then but

286
00:16:26,529 --> 00:16:31,689
it actually goes into production and
because we built on open source model

287
00:16:31,690 --> 00:16:35,720
we can then share it across all the
other counties what usually happens is

288
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:38,630
one county will dump all their finances
into building some

289
00:16:38,630 --> 00:16:41,759
like this and court

290
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:45,829
because by would be share it paid for it
ours

291
00:16:45,829 --> 00:16:49,100
guys

292
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:52,990
so that I I actually like this

293
00:16:52,990 --> 00:16:57,870
this illustration also because om it got
it entered into the Congressional Record

294
00:16:57,870 --> 00:17:01,240
as a with with willow down there in the
bottom thing

295
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:04,650
it's all reasonable um said

296
00:17:04,650 --> 00:17:08,699
but to but yeah the this was submitted
as an example

297
00:17:08,699 --> 00:17:11,980
love volunteer technology organizations
that

298
00:17:11,980 --> 00:17:15,309
are producing actual results in

299
00:17:15,309 --> 00:17:18,740
some people from that we work with
actually testified before Congress

300
00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:19,530
accuses

301
00:17:19,530 --> 00:17:23,730
as example and then when Christ Church
happened

302
00:17:23,730 --> 00:17:26,709
and they were trying to figure out what
all it happened right now we have this

303
00:17:26,709 --> 00:17:27,280
code

304
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:30,960
its commented out would you care for it

305
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:34,090
I don't even know if they used it but it
was just did here's the thing

306
00:17:34,090 --> 00:17:37,330
have at critical

307
00:17:37,330 --> 00:17:41,309
arm this this project up

308
00:17:41,309 --> 00:17:44,940
just KO mice had forgotten that we
worked on it but

309
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:48,750
arm I just got an email from from the
league I Carnegie Mellon

310
00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:53,360
last week and he was like EU member that
help you gave us last year

311
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:57,140
up this gets relations is for sale for
arm

312
00:17:57,140 --> 00:18:00,230
and anyway so

313
00:18:00,230 --> 00:18:04,559
what they did the Carnegie Mellon
University the the language institute I

314
00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:05,639
wanted to

315
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:09,130
figure out how to if they could use

316
00:18:09,130 --> 00:18:13,110
telephone-based interactive voice game

317
00:18:13,110 --> 00:18:16,330
to help low literate

318
00:18:16,330 --> 00:18:21,678
Tom world workers in Pakistan to get to
get information weather be like

319
00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:24,910
health information or information about
clean water

320
00:18:24,910 --> 00:18:27,919
or information about available jobs

321
00:18:27,919 --> 00:18:30,990
because these people don't normally have
access they can just go up to

322
00:18:30,990 --> 00:18:34,440
a job board in return to carry the
newspaper so they created a little

323
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:35,150
interactive

324
00:18:35,150 --> 00:18:38,440
telephone game and it was a very simple
thing you just

325
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:42,340
the seeded with like five university
students in the

326
00:18:42,340 --> 00:18:45,689
the five universityscience called up and
would play in

327
00:18:45,690 --> 00:18:49,250
give him some instructions an acre court
a message and then they could put a

328
00:18:49,250 --> 00:18:52,190
little filter on that message to make
their voice sound like Mickey Mouse

329
00:18:52,190 --> 00:18:53,630
shirt or Darth Vader

330
00:18:53,630 --> 00:18:57,830
and and then put in their friends phone
number and it would call her friend

331
00:18:57,830 --> 00:19:02,080
and then play the message and the friend
which listen to the message

332
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:06,809
and then get an option to hear some
information about local job listings

333
00:19:06,809 --> 00:19:10,570
and then get instructions on how they
could play the game as well and so since

334
00:19:10,570 --> 00:19:12,200
they launched this

335
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:16,240
last year they've had over 40,000
participants

336
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:21,370
over 500,000 phone calls and over 70,000
people listened

337
00:19:21,370 --> 00:19:24,470
chose the option to listen to you job
listings

338
00:19:24,470 --> 00:19:28,289
I thought it was kinda cool om

339
00:19:28,289 --> 00:19:31,490
want the other projects that we've been
working on this in

340
00:19:31,490 --> 00:19:34,870
crisis response one other things at

341
00:19:34,870 --> 00:19:39,770
that we've identified is very very
important is that people can communicate

342
00:19:39,770 --> 00:19:42,860
in a disaster situation when

343
00:19:42,860 --> 00:19:47,020
you know when there's a in in he d
basically all the infrastructure is

344
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:48,100
wiped out

345
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:51,530
you know in japan won had a tsunami all
the infrastructure is wiped out there's

346
00:19:51,530 --> 00:19:53,990
no cell phone towers

347
00:19:53,990 --> 00:19:57,090
and so we want is have see if you can
find a testbed

348
00:19:57,090 --> 00:20:01,860
a place where we could test some these
ideas are coming out over hackathons

349
00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:04,890
and help people communicate and so we

350
00:20:04,890 --> 00:20:07,950
took it to the biggest disaster area we
now

351
00:20:07,950 --> 00:20:11,380
on the middle of the desert comment
Black Rock City

352
00:20:11,380 --> 00:20:16,020
at Burning Man and and set up a cell
network with our

353
00:20:16,020 --> 00:20:19,830
our partners at open BTS open itself
open source

354
00:20:19,830 --> 00:20:22,870
base transceiver station and Dom

355
00:20:22,870 --> 00:20:26,110
and set up a network in and set up some
simple app so people could text each

356
00:20:26,110 --> 00:20:27,539
other on a plier

357
00:20:27,539 --> 00:20:31,600
dominated leave messages for other
further other people in their camp

358
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:34,860
and in basic use like Rome

359
00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:37,970
into this this Playa network

360
00:20:37,970 --> 00:20:41,870
in your phone just goes off and says
welcome to the plane at work

361
00:20:41,870 --> 00:20:45,230
into your phone number cuz you wanted to
be in a spirited Burning Man you can

362
00:20:45,230 --> 00:20:47,090
pick your own name your own identity

363
00:20:47,090 --> 00:20:50,908
pick your own phone number so and that
phone number was yours for

364
00:20:50,909 --> 00:20:54,770
as long as you want it on on the only on
the place only deployed

365
00:20:54,770 --> 00:20:58,650
calls and we're going again this year
what

366
00:20:58,650 --> 00:21:04,429
also you no one knew your plan number
unless you contact them first

367
00:21:04,429 --> 00:21:07,500
which was super cool see your boss
couldn't get ahold much that hold

368
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:11,140
first so down we're going back this year

369
00:21:11,140 --> 00:21:14,210
%uh an act I didn't actually get to go
last year but

370
00:21:14,210 --> 00:21:18,030
I get to go this year and so

371
00:21:18,030 --> 00:21:22,418
we're gonna test out some San additional
equipment and some

372
00:21:22,419 --> 00:21:25,650
actually perhaps some aerial drones it

373
00:21:25,650 --> 00:21:29,929
we can use to sniff and find cell phone
signals

374
00:21:29,929 --> 00:21:33,190
that's would be very important in the
case like an earthquake or people

375
00:21:33,190 --> 00:21:36,309
are buried under under the house or
something

376
00:21:36,309 --> 00:21:39,789
that you know there's a very short
period time all people still have

377
00:21:39,789 --> 00:21:41,070
battery power that they can

378
00:21:41,070 --> 00:21:44,189
you can send out signals and if there's
no towers listening there's no power to

379
00:21:44,190 --> 00:21:44,860
the towers

380
00:21:44,860 --> 00:21:51,860
army need a way that you can find out if
people to be said

381
00:21:52,059 --> 00:21:57,379
and then there's a fence okay

382
00:21:57,379 --> 00:22:00,720
so Ella

383
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:04,039
earlier today had the lovely 10 you
remember back in the beginning hi

384
00:22:04,039 --> 00:22:07,629
talk how dicks saying use talking about
this idea

385
00:22:07,629 --> 00:22:10,779
conferences in I ran into like a

386
00:22:10,779 --> 00:22:14,169
how are we doing this a a

387
00:22:14,169 --> 00:22:20,720
we immediately thing Ellis it's a dick
started it you finished it

388
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:26,039
that's exactly what happened so we
aren't sure that

389
00:22:26,039 --> 00:22:29,389
about a dozen hackerspace isn't about
four weeks

390
00:22:29,389 --> 00:22:33,429
it was pretty intense I wouldn't talk to
each other for about four months after

391
00:22:33,429 --> 00:22:33,950
that

392
00:22:33,950 --> 00:22:38,240
a but it was important to us because
this community

393
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:42,350
we're building the future the future
that we want

394
00:22:42,350 --> 00:22:45,799
I'm not future that were sleepwalking
into and

395
00:22:45,799 --> 00:22:49,990
so if we're gonna start dealing with
things that put us in grey areas because

396
00:22:49,990 --> 00:22:53,230
drone sniffing out signals you're also
talking about

397
00:22:53,230 --> 00:22:56,980
the ability that we might not want some
military take

398
00:22:56,980 --> 00:23:00,820
what what is that gray area how do we
walk it how are we

399
00:23:00,820 --> 00:23:05,320
how are we dealing with these really
hard questions and want to be an open

400
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:06,639
dialogue constantly

401
00:23:06,639 --> 00:23:10,080
a.m. so that's what we did and

402
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:14,559
we're still doing we also do random acts
of kindness

403
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:20,350
by yearly thing telling you about it's
incredible there a coalition

404
00:23:20,350 --> 00:23:23,379
between Google

405
00:23:23,379 --> 00:23:27,929
Microsoft Yahoo nasa and the World Bank

406
00:23:27,929 --> 00:23:32,039
I'm kinda the last one I really

407
00:23:32,039 --> 00:23:35,840
freaks me out but they dare you have to
deal with it

408
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:39,320
so how do you negotiate but people rock

409
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:42,939
are fantastic an and its it's locally

410
00:23:42,940 --> 00:23:46,460
and then it all ties into other places
during that

411
00:23:46,460 --> 00:23:50,389
the same weekend I'm game save was a
five-week

412
00:23:50,389 --> 00:23:54,879
challenge to game developers to create
basically better you live for a lot of

413
00:23:54,879 --> 00:23:56,360
these disaster response

414
00:23:56,360 --> 00:24:00,850
ideas and there were a lot group from

415
00:24:00,850 --> 00:24:06,070
international universities who really
want to participate but worried about

416
00:24:06,070 --> 00:24:07,009
grammar usage

417
00:24:07,009 --> 00:24:11,539
so I had a hockey for a while to the
wiki article

418
00:24:11,539 --> 00:24:15,490
all your base are belong to us I I
promise making a joke

419
00:24:15,490 --> 00:24:22,309
down and most recently we have the space
at challenge which was my feet rich

420
00:24:22,309 --> 00:24:26,470
nasa has done a really good job being a
part of the open initiative

421
00:24:26,470 --> 00:24:29,609
where they opened up a lot of their data
sets satellite imagery

422
00:24:29,609 --> 00:24:34,689
in formats that are useful a lot of
people that do open girls think that

423
00:24:34,690 --> 00:24:36,639
releasing PDF's is helping

424
00:24:36,639 --> 00:24:39,929
it's better than nothing but

425
00:24:39,929 --> 00:24:43,590
now says actually done a really good job
we wanted to see this

426
00:24:43,590 --> 00:24:47,899
use it and so they did a many city plus

427
00:24:47,899 --> 00:24:52,429
Antarctica is on every single comment
Center M space station

428
00:24:52,429 --> 00:24:56,169
i fan girl the entire time and got to do

429
00:24:56,169 --> 00:24:59,450
%uh logic puzzles which time zones were
happily

430
00:24:59,450 --> 00:25:03,009
where time zones were when people were
doing their announcement so that people

431
00:25:03,009 --> 00:25:03,909
in Nairobi

432
00:25:03,909 --> 00:25:07,999
listen to the announcement in New York
in it was it was better than

433
00:25:07,999 --> 00:25:12,330
the LSATs it was amazing a and her more
useful

434
00:25:12,330 --> 00:25:15,519
here so we're hoping to do one of those
again

435
00:25:15,519 --> 00:25:18,740
there's also something hot start I it's
which

436
00:25:18,740 --> 00:25:22,220
is based supra pixelated that's okay

437
00:25:22,220 --> 00:25:28,039
it's basically a trade show for Humanity
up-and-coming humanitarian response

438
00:25:28,039 --> 00:25:28,789
technologies

439
00:25:28,789 --> 00:25:33,629
specifically of the greatest of without
all the customers

440
00:25:33,629 --> 00:25:38,179
so its people getting to know everyone
on it's also with the Department

441
00:25:38,179 --> 00:25:41,249
defense Defense College so

442
00:25:41,249 --> 00:25:46,240
again gray areas military really good at
moving stuff in disaster

443
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:50,659
you're gonna have to interact with them
somehow why not figure out how

444
00:25:50,659 --> 00:25:54,509
or not up to you

445
00:25:54,509 --> 00:25:57,529
whatever and and then there's something
called relief

446
00:25:57,529 --> 00:26:00,619
which is but not just a display what's
going on

447
00:26:00,619 --> 00:26:04,889
actual test deployment a lot of these
technologies in this field

448
00:26:04,889 --> 00:26:09,460
seen time so what sort of and what
they're using

449
00:26:09,460 --> 00:26:13,519
frequencies are we on old those to run
into each other too good thing we tested

450
00:26:13,519 --> 00:26:17,599
now and while the pretenses on the
technological overlap

451
00:26:17,599 --> 00:26:20,939
and playing nice that way it's actually
about policy

452
00:26:20,940 --> 00:26:24,690
an about face to face time because to
often

453
00:26:24,690 --> 00:26:29,190
what we basically run into is its
someone who knows someone else

454
00:26:29,190 --> 00:26:33,509
in different organizations making a
phone call to make it happen

455
00:26:33,509 --> 00:26:36,730
you saw its talk earlier EFSF

456
00:26:36,730 --> 00:26:41,559
and mourners the people who were able to
have the name that they chose

457
00:26:41,559 --> 00:26:45,029
were initially the people who knew
someone Google just call

458
00:26:45,029 --> 00:26:48,460
that's what nearly everything oils
answer

459
00:26:48,460 --> 00:26:53,539
this is establishing relationships

460
00:26:53,539 --> 00:26:56,658
so what this boils down to for me

461
00:26:56,659 --> 00:26:59,750
everyone happy by the way okay good

462
00:26:59,750 --> 00:27:03,059
to actually okay okay so

463
00:27:03,059 --> 00:27:07,529
for me it was sent to sustainability on
this is huge discrepancy between

464
00:27:07,529 --> 00:27:10,970
traditional response people who know
what it looks like you know what can

465
00:27:10,970 --> 00:27:11,480
look like

466
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:16,759
know it's all it is but could be so much
better if they just try some new things

467
00:27:16,759 --> 00:27:20,129
and people who were so into the shining
and quick deployment

468
00:27:20,129 --> 00:27:23,779
that they forget how to be stable I am
one of those people

469
00:27:23,779 --> 00:27:27,929
it's okay and so we started taking some
of the most promising

470
00:27:27,929 --> 00:27:31,940
project teams out random acts of
kindness and inviting

471
00:27:31,940 --> 00:27:35,149
take place in the accelerator ride six
months

472
00:27:35,149 --> 00:27:42,149
mentor ship business development
security

473
00:27:42,220 --> 00:27:45,629
a legal entity all the things you need
to make a business so that it's not just

474
00:27:45,629 --> 00:27:48,299
sustainable and respectful for the
people there

475
00:27:48,299 --> 00:27:51,730
that are using it your user base but
also for the people building it

476
00:27:51,730 --> 00:27:56,179
so they can focus so it's not just
weekend they walk away

477
00:27:56,179 --> 00:28:00,509
and that bills and responsible business
practices and transparent accounting

478
00:28:00,509 --> 00:28:03,970
and how to do a non-profit you don't
need to make a whole lot of money but

479
00:28:03,970 --> 00:28:05,129
you can

480
00:28:05,129 --> 00:28:08,690
et cetera and so we have three teams

481
00:28:08,690 --> 00:28:12,240
we do not hide and distract okay

482
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:15,740
so I'm biomed tackling sup

483
00:28:15,740 --> 00:28:18,749
medical technologies with the geography

484
00:28:18,749 --> 00:28:22,399
and people populations that are best
suited to them so

485
00:28:22,399 --> 00:28:26,349
the same thing that you would deploy in

486
00:28:26,349 --> 00:28:30,700
in South Africa my not actually work
Russian

487
00:28:30,700 --> 00:28:35,019
new the environment is different the
cultures are different

488
00:28:35,019 --> 00:28:38,720
and for teachers

489
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:41,840
for teachers I like to call it to

490
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:46,720
get help for lesson plans its Tom its
its allowing teachers to share

491
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:50,789
their own knowledge with other teachers
so they don't have to reinvent the wheel

492
00:28:50,789 --> 00:28:54,619
they're all you know basically teaching
the same things and

493
00:28:54,619 --> 00:28:58,940
so using the you know leading assertive
crowd

494
00:28:58,940 --> 00:29:02,179
I you know thumbs up thumbs down

495
00:29:02,179 --> 00:29:06,730
lesson plans and you can't get very much
more effective

496
00:29:06,730 --> 00:29:09,779
wat to educate

497
00:29:09,779 --> 00:29:13,129
in theory it frees teachers up to have
more time to be creative with their

498
00:29:13,129 --> 00:29:14,019
students

499
00:29:14,019 --> 00:29:16,879
and the people who are building are
aware that they don't just want to

500
00:29:16,879 --> 00:29:18,740
provide another opportunity for some

501
00:29:18,740 --> 00:29:23,230
lackluster instructors to slack or so
we're trying to build

502
00:29:23,230 --> 00:29:26,659
out responsibly that's what it's about
a.m.

503
00:29:26,659 --> 00:29:30,270
water me is about taking that nasa data
and

504
00:29:30,270 --> 00:29:34,180
satellite imagery and tracking droughts
seeing

505
00:29:34,180 --> 00:29:37,220
how what it looks like and

506
00:29:37,220 --> 00:29:41,320
and talking to people on the ground what
what did you plant harried

507
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:44,809
crop rotation was a look like how can
recycle better

508
00:29:44,809 --> 00:29:48,720
responsible it's fascinating me
especially because drought

509
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:52,040
super political because strapped happen
because people are still

510
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:57,090
water so not being careful about that
sort of information can be really

511
00:29:57,090 --> 00:29:57,960
dangerous

512
00:29:57,960 --> 00:30:02,110
there's an example activate

513
00:30:02,110 --> 00:30:05,370
so if you want to get involved

514
00:30:05,370 --> 00:30:08,850
jump onto a local rock happen all over
the place and it's a really good way to

515
00:30:08,850 --> 00:30:09,370
see

516
00:30:09,370 --> 00:30:13,100
where your local subject matter experts
are with the

517
00:30:13,100 --> 00:30:16,640
need I am blobs algorithm right now

518
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:21,059
I took on a matching same thing with
social

519
00:30:21,059 --> 00:30:24,230
coding for good with with Selene

520
00:30:24,230 --> 00:30:28,650
whatever on she's awesome but that
doesn't enter into the stock

521
00:30:28,650 --> 00:30:32,179
just brought that up okay so

522
00:30:32,179 --> 00:30:37,420
that will connect you to what is locally
relevant to you you can also champion

523
00:30:37,420 --> 00:30:38,179
Open Data

524
00:30:38,179 --> 00:30:41,980
open Gulf open source let's keep this
going on a track it is

525
00:30:41,980 --> 00:30:45,530
not let it be taken by people that we
don't care and don't get it

526
00:30:45,530 --> 00:30:49,500
and you can also volunteer your your
time to local organizations

527
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:52,910
oftentimes they don't need another app
they just need you

528
00:30:52,910 --> 00:30:57,880
need someone who understands crossover
cables to go in and make their office

529
00:30:57,880 --> 00:31:01,950
more efficient the amount of time that
people spend just waiting for the

530
00:31:01,950 --> 00:31:02,520
computer

531
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:07,120
load when it could just use a good
scrubbing go in and help them

532
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:11,100
and relationship started so that when
shit gets real

533
00:31:11,100 --> 00:31:16,030
you already know who you should be
talking to you and they know the same I

534
00:31:16,030 --> 00:31:17,730
know it's not as a learning

535
00:31:17,730 --> 00:31:21,070
but that is what counts and think

536
00:31:21,070 --> 00:31:24,800
forcing I would recommend telecomm Inc
seized

537
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:27,970
talk earlier their incredible adore them
getting them

538
00:31:27,970 --> 00:31:31,990
in some way done anything

539
00:31:31,990 --> 00:31:37,990
thank you and if anyone has any
questions

540
00:31:37,990 --> 00:31:44,990
were here

541
00:31:53,750 --> 00:32:00,750
if

542
00:32:19,610 --> 00:32:22,660
I'm I'm down um will be quick about it
cuz

543
00:32:22,660 --> 00:32:25,670
II usually go to bed make an hour ago

544
00:32:25,670 --> 00:32:31,010
am but yes week we can do that after wet
butts to some other cue in a really

545
00:32:31,010 --> 00:32:31,870
quick and then all

546
00:32:31,870 --> 00:32:38,870
a figure that out

547
00:32:47,190 --> 00:32:50,150
there are a lot of applications that are
built for smartphones

548
00:32:50,150 --> 00:32:54,830
like people tracking in all sorts of
other stuff on we've been told that cell

549
00:32:54,830 --> 00:32:55,980
phone to ubiquitous

550
00:32:55,980 --> 00:32:59,860
that does not mean that smartphones are
ubiquitous on

551
00:32:59,860 --> 00:33:05,320
they use a lot a band with a lot of
power and they also assume usually some

552
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:05,879
level

553
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:08,900
literacy in the language is the
developer

554
00:33:08,900 --> 00:33:12,110
and so just

555
00:33:12,110 --> 00:33:15,630
just pay attention to people who have
been there

556
00:33:15,630 --> 00:33:18,740
in even though we're really use to as a
subculture

557
00:33:18,740 --> 00:33:23,730
actually I think I know better you don't
you might come up with a really

558
00:33:23,730 --> 00:33:28,270
incredible way to route around what
issue they're having

559
00:33:28,270 --> 00:33:32,370
but you still have to understand at its
core the issue that they're having

560
00:33:32,370 --> 00:33:37,250
yeah I think that

561
00:33:37,250 --> 00:33:42,230
you know there's it's really easy chip

562
00:33:42,230 --> 00:33:46,660
to think that that you can solve all the
problems with technology

563
00:33:46,660 --> 00:33:53,230
and many times that's om its it's
actually like a hindrance

564
00:33:53,230 --> 00:33:56,850
and you can I and the other thing is
that arm

565
00:33:56,850 --> 00:34:00,010
E it's really easy in this

566
00:34:00,010 --> 00:34:03,170
space to step on other people's toes

567
00:34:03,170 --> 00:34:07,340
other organizations that have been you
know

568
00:34:07,340 --> 00:34:12,880
sick put their time in I there's a weird
thing that happens in disasters where

569
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:17,620
people wanna own the thing that they're
good at and there's a reason for that

570
00:34:17,620 --> 00:34:18,770
because usually

571
00:34:18,770 --> 00:34:22,400
they've done it a lot and aid the you're
just getting in their way

572
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:25,570
arm there is it there's

573
00:34:25,570 --> 00:34:30,880
dick a friend of ours arm actually
solace firsthand in haiti when AM

574
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:34,070
there is a the

575
00:34:34,070 --> 00:34:37,230
in Haiti after it is months after the
earthquake

576
00:34:37,230 --> 00:34:40,780
they're still work going on in a bit om
the kinda broke up

577
00:34:40,780 --> 00:34:45,440
the port a prince in zones and they had
different organizations

578
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:49,420
on the head Sen you know volunteers down
and they they cannot block them often

579
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:50,139
blocks in

580
00:34:50,139 --> 00:34:53,250
and they were kinda responsible for on

581
00:34:53,250 --> 00:34:56,750
helping developing this area and om

582
00:34:56,750 --> 00:35:00,370
and so one other organizations there was
like a a house that was

583
00:35:00,370 --> 00:35:04,990
on the border om ands there was a woman
in a wheelchair that needed

584
00:35:04,990 --> 00:35:08,720
that had no access up to her front porch
and so

585
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:12,980
they use all this problem they want they
built a ramp and Om

586
00:35:12,980 --> 00:35:16,560
there is a party the challenges at it
these organizations a

587
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:19,750
to get funding from things that they do

588
00:35:19,750 --> 00:35:23,140
and if you're responsible for this area
Tom

589
00:35:23,140 --> 00:35:26,830
that could threaten your funding if
somebody else is doing the things you're

590
00:35:26,830 --> 00:35:27,770
supposed to be doing

591
00:35:27,770 --> 00:35:32,090
so the second organization came in and
made them removed the ramp that had been

592
00:35:32,090 --> 00:35:32,630
built

593
00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:36,770
arm and just this kind of like a red

594
00:35:36,770 --> 00:35:40,080
tape ish tapes policy stuff arm

595
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:44,279
can really interfere with the overall
you know doing good stuff

596
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:47,670
but om but yeah the that

597
00:35:47,670 --> 00:35:51,030
and i sat release answer your question
but it was

598
00:35:51,030 --> 00:35:54,410
is what was your story on Intel at a way
to tie it together

599
00:35:54,410 --> 00:36:01,410
and is so technology we often think
unsolved really strange issues

600
00:36:02,470 --> 00:36:05,870
when technology can only make things
more efficient like it

601
00:36:05,870 --> 00:36:09,299
can extrapolate what human intent is

602
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:13,530
muscle problems we run into any manage
change are human problems because people

603
00:36:13,530 --> 00:36:13,940
can be

604
00:36:13,940 --> 00:36:17,280
X a.m. such as in the case of the story

605
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:20,700
so what good technology can do is get
out of the way

606
00:36:20,700 --> 00:36:24,070
people being awesome and get in the way
of people being

607
00:36:24,070 --> 00:36:31,070
call

608
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:41,400
so favorite paper products are projects
that were most

609
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:45,110
a how to have on did the ones we told
you about

610
00:36:45,110 --> 00:36:49,110
a I'm really pleased with I see if I can
find

611
00:36:49,110 --> 00:36:55,040
so resume around on this present there
are some

612
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:58,050
a organizations there on here that I
just

613
00:36:58,050 --> 00:37:03,040
find phenomenal on telecom it is %ah

614
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:06,710
obviously one of them I have a total
organizational crash on a

615
00:37:06,710 --> 00:37:10,400
there's also lick

616
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:13,650
OpenStreetMap is what they believe there
were no

617
00:37:13,650 --> 00:37:17,140
good BAPS a port a prince or any in
Haiti

618
00:37:17,140 --> 00:37:20,850
before the earthquake and so something
like actually wear something no one

619
00:37:20,850 --> 00:37:21,279
knows

620
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:24,530
some how are we going to get this thing
there

621
00:37:24,530 --> 00:37:28,250
a.m. so they did OpenStreetMap is
basically a wiki

622
00:37:28,250 --> 00:37:31,840
maps people they do these walking papers
that are really cool where you have a

623
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:32,650
piece of paper

624
00:37:32,650 --> 00:37:35,750
you walk around 20 QR code in the corner
and you pace

625
00:37:35,750 --> 00:37:39,500
pain is this many cases to this building
and then there were the road and I think

626
00:37:39,500 --> 00:37:39,920
it was

627
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:43,610
called this whose this many places to
this and then you go back

628
00:37:43,610 --> 00:37:47,090
to the group and you take a picture of
the paper in the QR code and it auto

629
00:37:47,090 --> 00:37:49,190
uploaded into this thing and then you
can

630
00:37:49,190 --> 00:37:53,100
detail for in attic on on the computer

631
00:37:53,100 --> 00:37:57,310
it's incredible and that's what things
like here built of

632
00:37:57,310 --> 00:38:00,660
here %uh then you plug in the response

633
00:38:00,660 --> 00:38:04,410
things in the request for help and also
dished up on a popular to maps that your

634
00:38:04,410 --> 00:38:05,210
first responders

635
00:38:05,210 --> 00:38:11,470
have a much easier time being more
efficient on this also

636
00:38:11,470 --> 00:38:15,210
there's a group called data kind and
that base

637
00:38:15,210 --> 00:38:19,270
they're really good at Big Data and they
go through all sorts I don't even get it

638
00:38:19,270 --> 00:38:23,580
I hope someday I can understand it but
they use big data science for

639
00:38:23,580 --> 00:38:26,779
helping people up

640
00:38:26,780 --> 00:38:30,990
they're also really good folk this
crisis mappers

641
00:38:30,990 --> 00:38:34,960
synergy Strikeforce also one of my
favorites because

642
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:40,210
baby use we read government funding to
do really crazy stuff like get

643
00:38:40,210 --> 00:38:43,820
midwives into at risk areas Afghanistan

644
00:38:43,820 --> 00:38:47,430
where no one wants to go because they go
in and figure out the culture and they

645
00:38:47,430 --> 00:38:50,600
figure out how to get them there in
support them and they just disappear

646
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:53,740
which me to care this everybody's cool
every school

647
00:38:53,740 --> 00:38:59,140
keep yeah either

648
00:38:59,140 --> 00:39:02,770
%uh stem by Task Force are so

649
00:39:02,770 --> 00:39:06,360
stem a task force is a bunch of basic
rice matter group

650
00:39:06,360 --> 00:39:11,000
om the were they were actually activated

651
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:14,210
by the United Nations to setup

652
00:39:14,210 --> 00:39:17,640
crisis match for Libya now in the
violence there

653
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:21,870
erupted om they do really really good
work in their

654
00:39:21,870 --> 00:39:25,120
and and the the people that om

655
00:39:25,120 --> 00:39:29,529
that are part of that group are very
very responsible people they're very

656
00:39:29,530 --> 00:39:30,670
aware that

657
00:39:30,670 --> 00:39:34,970
om that these maps that they're building

658
00:39:34,970 --> 00:39:40,310
can very easily be used in a way that
they don't want them to and so it's

659
00:39:40,310 --> 00:39:43,529
its its really treading a very very
tight

660
00:39:43,530 --> 00:39:46,620
line because that

661
00:39:46,620 --> 00:39:50,850
difference between a rebel and a
protester

662
00:39:50,850 --> 00:39:54,470
is not always easy

663
00:39:54,470 --> 00:39:58,120
dependence really depends on which side
you're on cell

664
00:39:58,120 --> 00:40:02,310
om so that's that I really liked that
the work that they've been doing

665
00:40:02,310 --> 00:40:05,759
om losses on their tether

666
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:09,590
%ah up in upper right hand corner
tethers a isn't

667
00:40:09,590 --> 00:40:13,110
crisis our communication system in a box

668
00:40:13,110 --> 00:40:16,250
it's like 3G wifi

669
00:40:16,250 --> 00:40:19,900
om it works it does ham radio

670
00:40:19,900 --> 00:40:24,650
on it works of a car battery you take on
these boxes and stick it

671
00:40:24,650 --> 00:40:28,780
I'm somewhere presumably somewhere high
up as possible

672
00:40:28,780 --> 00:40:33,540
and you can blanket area and and let
people communicate and even if it's not

673
00:40:33,540 --> 00:40:34,700
connected to the Internet

674
00:40:34,700 --> 00:40:38,720
it's got built in crisis mapping
software so I can start collecting data

675
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:39,430
and people in

676
00:40:39,430 --> 00:40:43,430
he just text message into it or or call
into its gonna

677
00:40:43,430 --> 00:40:47,490
phone system I V our system built in and
get

678
00:40:47,490 --> 00:40:51,160
com request for help in there and then
when the box gets connected to the

679
00:40:51,160 --> 00:40:53,379
Internet can upload all the information

680
00:40:53,380 --> 00:40:56,480
immediately and get into the hands
responder si

681
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:59,520
that could help

682
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:06,520
so much information

683
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:16,930
the question is about dealing with
bureaucracy other NGOs

684
00:41:16,930 --> 00:41:21,690
like on face to face time really helps

685
00:41:21,690 --> 00:41:24,940
a charming the pants off someone will

686
00:41:24,940 --> 00:41:28,150
not actually that would be awkward up

687
00:41:28,150 --> 00:41:32,109
but on going in meeting someone in
having drinks with them and just say

688
00:41:32,109 --> 00:41:34,100
even before stuff happens

689
00:41:34,100 --> 00:41:37,470
are you doing this thing I think you're
awesome

690
00:41:37,470 --> 00:41:40,720
here's how I think we overlap I'll
catcha later

691
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:44,119
even just that is is a really big deal
there

692
00:41:44,119 --> 00:41:48,359
there are groups out there who really
strongly to their local governments and

693
00:41:48,359 --> 00:41:49,380
figure all that out

694
00:41:49,380 --> 00:41:53,440
were not them we put technological group

695
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:58,430
in touch with people who knows land who
are local to that on

696
00:41:58,430 --> 00:42:03,060
so I don't know the answer to your
question I just talk to the people who

697
00:42:03,060 --> 00:42:06,670
figure it out II I have no

698
00:42:06,670 --> 00:42:13,670
desire or ability to march through mom
to give me an example

699
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:19,740
I'll I'm also the time that that we've
been

700
00:42:19,740 --> 00:42:23,010
that we've been kinda watching this
space in and learning

701
00:42:23,010 --> 00:42:27,190
om a wanted this

702
00:42:27,190 --> 00:42:31,119
you know that the earthquake in

703
00:42:31,119 --> 00:42:34,560
resulting tsunami that happened in Japan
om

704
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:38,400
1i think that we try to do is wait for
our question how

705
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:41,970
a local or question how arm an weaved

706
00:42:41,970 --> 00:42:45,400
been tending to do that to wait for the
if there's a local hackerspace

707
00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:49,650
or a local humanitarian organization
that has put out a formal request for

708
00:42:49,650 --> 00:42:50,040
help

709
00:42:50,040 --> 00:42:53,759
rather than just start shipping them by
kids when they actually might need

710
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:58,040
bottles of water or you know sending
them ham radios when they need

711
00:42:58,040 --> 00:43:01,570
on radiation detection kits so

712
00:43:01,570 --> 00:43:06,180
om but in the case of Japan that request
never really came because japan is an

713
00:43:06,180 --> 00:43:06,859
Italian

714
00:43:06,859 --> 00:43:11,440
their government was in a very om very

715
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:14,700
good place to respond to that released

716
00:43:14,700 --> 00:43:18,470
from their perspective they were and so
there was no

717
00:43:18,470 --> 00:43:22,700
real of a formal request for help there
was we did get some requests from now on

718
00:43:22,700 --> 00:43:26,150
you know the old took you hackerspace in
am by to

719
00:43:26,150 --> 00:43:29,170
but if there's no requests for help

720
00:43:29,170 --> 00:43:32,220
you can't force help on our community
you can't for Sat

721
00:43:32,220 --> 00:43:35,850
and so om so usually its

722
00:43:35,850 --> 00:43:39,770
only after the request comes out that
that the humanitarian organizations

723
00:43:39,770 --> 00:43:40,440
respond

724
00:43:40,440 --> 00:43:43,830
in once that request comes out the the

725
00:43:43,830 --> 00:43:47,840
you know political barriers in and
bureaucracy cat

726
00:43:47,840 --> 00:43:52,869
starts to fade away very quickly it's
also really good if you can have awesome

727
00:43:52,869 --> 00:43:54,020
stuff lined up

728
00:43:54,020 --> 00:43:57,930
that requires open source ideology

729
00:43:57,930 --> 00:44:01,049
and requires that they're on board with
someone here

730
00:44:01,050 --> 00:44:04,160
more radical believes because right then

731
00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:07,799
is when you can affect huge policy
change without dealing with all the

732
00:44:07,800 --> 00:44:08,580
bureaucracy

733
00:44:08,580 --> 00:44:11,830
guess what you just sign on to you a.m.

734
00:44:11,830 --> 00:44:18,830
which is awful but they play the same
game so

735
00:44:32,750 --> 00:44:35,600
so the question is about got basically
transition

736
00:44:35,600 --> 00:44:41,280
between global effort local effort
training some wanted to be getting

737
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:46,160
care have the ability to there are some
groups out there

738
00:44:46,160 --> 00:44:49,250
he has a huge presence in Nairobi

739
00:44:49,250 --> 00:44:53,390
their part the I hope their days they're
really big effort

740
00:44:53,390 --> 00:44:57,140
to engage with with the folks there and

741
00:44:57,140 --> 00:45:01,470
I don't know much more on that we're
working on it

742
00:45:01,470 --> 00:45:04,620
on especially through things like at
heart and making sure that people i

743
00:45:04,620 --> 00:45:05,130
connect

744
00:45:05,130 --> 00:45:09,560
the global community so they know they
can ask to bear

745
00:45:09,560 --> 00:45:12,940
were trying it'd huge problem

746
00:45:12,940 --> 00:45:16,870
it's something that is a group called UN
osha damages for the

747
00:45:16,870 --> 00:45:20,390
organization Earth Day

748
00:45:20,390 --> 00:45:24,040
office have Coordination of Humanitarian
something

749
00:45:24,040 --> 00:45:27,970
and their sole purpose is to coordinate

750
00:45:27,970 --> 00:45:31,750
this huge number response organizations

751
00:45:31,750 --> 00:45:35,910
and in one of their big things on their
plate

752
00:45:35,910 --> 00:45:40,120
is transition some mister college
earlier this week about that would have

753
00:45:40,120 --> 00:45:41,069
a better question

754
00:45:41,070 --> 00:45:45,180
your answer but its it's known as an
issue

755
00:45:45,180 --> 00:45:50,230
they're working on it there are some is
a called rocks lol each

756
00:45:50,230 --> 00:45:53,470
develops on open Mrs which is open
medical

757
00:45:53,470 --> 00:45:58,170
platform and that doctors can Kentucky
meant what's been going on

758
00:45:58,170 --> 00:46:02,340
how for the follow-up the patient
automate some that and so you don't have

759
00:46:02,340 --> 00:46:06,290
a group of people using only have the
antibiotics and then dropping it which

760
00:46:06,290 --> 00:46:11,150
makes it so much worse and they're
actually

761
00:46:11,150 --> 00:46:14,920
in the area that they're working with
I'm even Uganda

762
00:46:14,920 --> 00:46:18,640
are working with a local government
there's also a group that's doing

763
00:46:18,640 --> 00:46:22,560
sorta 311 for slums thats in similar
area

764
00:46:22,560 --> 00:46:26,880
on that is called churry fact he

765
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:30,120
a are F I a I think

766
00:46:30,120 --> 00:46:33,299
a follow up with me and all all answer
that

767
00:46:33,300 --> 00:46:37,340
with the way blocked at work but that
we're

768
00:46:37,340 --> 00:46:44,340
