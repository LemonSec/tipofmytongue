1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:03,240
that's it's about conceptual approaches
to you on

2
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:08,910
actually a contemporary and modern art
and also how that connects to hacking

3
00:00:08,910 --> 00:00:12,190
an John Cage improvisation

4
00:00:12,190 --> 00:00:15,969
and musical interface design and gaming
technology

5
00:00:15,969 --> 00:00:19,930
how all three of those things play into
art packing

6
00:00:19,930 --> 00:00:23,698
and an and bag repurposed technology

7
00:00:23,699 --> 00:00:27,160
so on my name's Tamra at our

8
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:30,250
and I'm going to be giving a

9
00:00:30,250 --> 00:00:33,610
my sections going to be about John Cage
and I am

10
00:00:33,610 --> 00:00:37,180
said at the legacy that contributed to
his

11
00:00:37,180 --> 00:00:41,690
a working with silence as a concept in
music

12
00:00:41,690 --> 00:00:45,750
and Nicole Carol right here in a left

13
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:48,800
is a custom and sent builder

14
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:53,280
an electro-acoustic improviser should be
talking about interface design today

15
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:57,360
and Joshua cop sitting here we'll be
talking about gaming technology the demo

16
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:00,000
scene and a soft software crackers

17
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,340
okay so and

18
00:01:03,340 --> 00:01:10,340
just to start of is everyone familiar
with this

19
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:15,798
image this is

20
00:01:15,799 --> 00:01:19,670
that what a page from the score of four
minutes and 33 seconds

21
00:01:19,670 --> 00:01:23,939
there's anybody reads standard notation
okay

22
00:01:23,939 --> 00:01:27,380
so we pretty much know what this means
right

23
00:01:27,380 --> 00:01:32,880
were resting for the entire time this
was a and seminal piece of work that was

24
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:37,039
a composed in 1951 performed in
Woodstock

25
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:40,710
and by David Tudor and musician

26
00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:44,280
and I'm it received it was just

27
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:48,320
uproarious people were just completely

28
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:51,380
upset they paid to come see music and
they got this

29
00:01:51,380 --> 00:01:56,979
I'm so having said that let me move
forward to the next slide

30
00:01:56,979 --> 00:02:01,110
Nicole

31
00:02:01,110 --> 00:02:08,110
can you comment on this image really
quickly breadboard

32
00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:12,879
Arduino interface yes controllers

33
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:19,879
great and this is an image other craft
room

34
00:02:20,030 --> 00:02:23,640
which I'm Josh wanna say anything about
that quickly

35
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:27,579
okay

36
00:02:27,579 --> 00:02:31,739
right on how was a real crackers okay
kill a comment from mommy

37
00:02:31,739 --> 00:02:38,140
the humorous really nice okay

38
00:02:38,140 --> 00:02:42,879
so where this all comes from

39
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:47,120
is from an article that Richard Stallman
road called on hacking

40
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:50,560
I'm be house you know

41
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:55,170
a hacking developed at MIT you know in
the sixties is very Caracol toral and

42
00:02:55,170 --> 00:02:56,310
they were trying to find them

43
00:02:56,310 --> 00:03:00,349
mostly programmers and you know computer
and

44
00:03:00,349 --> 00:03:04,060
hackers geeks Chigwell

45
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:07,739
I there's been a stigma that's been

46
00:03:07,739 --> 00:03:11,560
and attached to you that term obviously
so

47
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:14,810
Richard Stallman wrote this article high
are a lot of you familiar with that

48
00:03:14,810 --> 00:03:15,459
actually

49
00:03:15,459 --> 00:03:18,930
because maybe I can just skip ahead okay

50
00:03:18,930 --> 00:03:22,540
I'm alright good really hands

51
00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:26,048
nobody okay okay alright so I'm

52
00:03:26,049 --> 00:03:30,980
basically I he wanted to say you wanted
to try a TT stigmatize the word

53
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:31,730
basically

54
00:03:31,730 --> 00:03:35,680
saying that you know hacking is not
necessarily

55
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:39,769
about destruction you know i mean you
could destroy something and they make

56
00:03:39,769 --> 00:03:40,870
something new from

57
00:03:40,870 --> 00:03:45,319
it but that it's not about you know it's
not a malicious thang

58
00:03:45,319 --> 00:03:50,879
on and so he perform this experiment it
happened actually he was at dinner with

59
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:51,849
a friend and aide

60
00:03:51,849 --> 00:03:57,090
pertain to Chopstix on the wager set
down for two sets of chopsticks instead

61
00:03:57,090 --> 00:03:57,790
of one

62
00:03:57,790 --> 00:04:02,290
and he was completely you know taken by
it struck by that I was like

63
00:04:02,290 --> 00:04:05,629
well why not use for so he merely pick
them up

64
00:04:05,629 --> 00:04:09,269
and started trying to you you know
change his behavior

65
00:04:09,269 --> 00:04:12,500
I'm to adapt to this sort of idea

66
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:15,639
I'm having so bad the reason

67
00:04:15,639 --> 00:04:18,769
art is important here is because I have
this

68
00:04:18,769 --> 00:04:21,858
you know creative act that he's actually
take out right here

69
00:04:21,858 --> 00:04:26,680
I'm so in this article he specifically
mentions these two composers

70
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:29,699
which is really excellent on he

71
00:04:29,699 --> 00:04:34,690
me and music specifically not any other
artworks but just music and composers

72
00:04:34,690 --> 00:04:38,279
next to you practical jokes and other
various cultural

73
00:04:38,279 --> 00:04:41,849
things that aren't necessarily
associated with art I'm

74
00:04:41,849 --> 00:04:48,070
so I'm he said that both of these
composers gameday my show who was an

75
00:04:48,070 --> 00:04:51,870
seminal to polyphonic music at the 14th
century medieval composer

76
00:04:51,870 --> 00:04:55,080
and John Cage is an American on car
pioneer

77
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:58,529
fun pay near the Arrancar music on

78
00:04:58,529 --> 00:05:02,409
in the 20th century in an American music
contemporary music

79
00:05:02,409 --> 00:05:06,099
on he said that these things have tons a
pack value

80
00:05:06,099 --> 00:05:09,919
that these pieces these composers what
they did their work have this thing

81
00:05:09,919 --> 00:05:10,219
called

82
00:05:10,219 --> 00:05:13,639
hack value and hack value is basically a
bad thing

83
00:05:13,639 --> 00:05:19,330
which I'm that playful cleverness that
you incorporate to push

84
00:05:19,330 --> 00:05:22,770
beyond the limits have something
something that's either impose

85
00:05:22,770 --> 00:05:25,020
self-imposed you know based on social

86
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:29,400
you know conditioning arm or what not or
or just limitations have

87
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:32,469
at the hardware as its you know
presented to you

88
00:05:32,469 --> 00:05:36,430
from whoever whoever you get it from so

89
00:05:36,430 --> 00:05:41,070
arm so

90
00:05:41,070 --> 00:05:46,000
having said that and I'm gonna jump into
so a little bit in art history here from

91
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,550
on early 20th century I'm talk about

92
00:05:49,550 --> 00:05:53,229
I Marcel Duchamp who is like the
grandfather of conceptual art

93
00:05:53,229 --> 00:05:58,229
I'm conceptual art is sort of like and
it was it's an idea

94
00:05:58,229 --> 00:06:02,529
that emphasizes at the idea or how

95
00:06:02,529 --> 00:06:05,710
I'm an artwork is put together over in
you know

96
00:06:05,710 --> 00:06:09,150
the traditional sense of aesthetics and
materials that are usually emphasized

97
00:06:09,150 --> 00:06:12,380
and more fine arts just straight fine
arts culture painting

98
00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:18,000
so I'm it's not really necessarily about
materials but how

99
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:23,539
the materials are used on having said
that does everyone buttino

100
00:06:23,539 --> 00:06:28,330
on the fountain fountain yes very famous
and

101
00:06:28,330 --> 00:06:32,330
very famous work by on Marcel Duchamp on

102
00:06:32,330 --> 00:06:36,339
that was presented at her am so excuse
me it was rejected from

103
00:06:36,339 --> 00:06:40,529
other Society of independent artist
exhibition in 1917 which is

104
00:06:40,529 --> 00:06:43,940
really funny because he was actually the
director of the society

105
00:06:43,940 --> 00:06:47,469
they rejected his work and then he
resigned on

106
00:06:47,470 --> 00:06:53,979
so let me just show you a picture back
quickly and then I'll jump at

107
00:06:53,979 --> 00:06:58,310
on the left is and about 10 shot himself
in the middle

108
00:06:58,310 --> 00:07:02,879
donning his alter ego gross I love you
and I the bicycle wheel

109
00:07:02,879 --> 00:07:07,379
which is am I really am beautiful
sculpture actually make our nation on

110
00:07:07,379 --> 00:07:12,550
what you see store on a bicycle wheel so
I'm the fountain assigned with are much

111
00:07:12,550 --> 00:07:17,479
and this was at the you now to your own
also it was very very important to this

112
00:07:17,479 --> 00:07:18,280
idea

113
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:21,610
repositioning something in a different
context if you will

114
00:07:21,610 --> 00:07:28,610
repurpose saying that I'm jacked and
redefining its function

115
00:07:28,970 --> 00:07:34,539
okay

116
00:07:34,539 --> 00:07:38,340
soda shop was sort so you know the
conceptual aspect is is there

117
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:42,340
I was called a ready made by the way
which is the idea taking found objects

118
00:07:42,340 --> 00:07:45,380
and I'm repurpose and memory decisioning
them

119
00:07:45,380 --> 00:07:48,479
on Ian the bicycle wheel was also that

120
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:51,919
I'm so be he was some

121
00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:55,990
definitely into many different forms of
media he wasn't a Connecticut sculpture

122
00:07:55,990 --> 00:07:56,780
movement

123
00:07:56,780 --> 00:08:00,710
et cetera on he incorporated what's
called the

124
00:08:00,710 --> 00:08:04,150
you know the idea used incorporating
chance into

125
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:07,389
I sculpture with the idea that

126
00:08:07,389 --> 00:08:11,460
something would happen and says its
physical

127
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:16,020
if I just do that you know he was
anticipating sounds so he was calling

128
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:17,520
the musical happenings

129
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:20,690
on a rather Music Holland

130
00:08:20,690 --> 00:08:24,110
which was made in 1914 and never
finished his

131
00:08:24,110 --> 00:08:28,430
actually an a and an instrument for

132
00:08:28,430 --> 00:08:34,130
machine so that the idea that is one of
the new technology fails you now I'm

133
00:08:34,130 --> 00:08:37,969
what if somebody bumps into in kicks it
over because it's you know positioned

134
00:08:37,969 --> 00:08:39,020
like in the corner

135
00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:44,149
the restaurant I miss cetera so having
said that

136
00:08:44,149 --> 00:08:47,820
a douche on how these very very
revolutionary ideas about what

137
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:51,209
%um what music as what's called jurors

138
00:08:51,209 --> 00:08:55,149
and what art is in general I'm sorry the
ontology have

139
00:08:55,149 --> 00:08:58,230
art if you will I'm so

140
00:08:58,230 --> 00:09:01,360
I having said that John Cage met

141
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:04,980
Marcel Duchamp in the 1940s I'm to shop

142
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:08,570
wanted him to make a composition for
something and he said well you know you

143
00:09:08,570 --> 00:09:09,329
don't really make

144
00:09:09,329 --> 00:09:12,560
art anymore so on but I know you play
chess because you

145
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:15,670
started playing chess after he retired
from being an artist so

146
00:09:15,670 --> 00:09:19,040
I want you to teach me how to play chess
so that was the beginning of their

147
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:19,899
relationship

148
00:09:19,899 --> 00:09:26,250
so

149
00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:31,079
I'm be once

150
00:09:31,079 --> 00:09:35,329
I'm cage started and spending time with
you shop he came up

151
00:09:35,329 --> 00:09:38,450
with some fairly strange

152
00:09:38,450 --> 00:09:42,740
a ideas about what MusiCares so he wrote
this piece

153
00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:46,160
call the Future Music in this book
called silence which is

154
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:49,250
about his lectures and writings it's at
the beginning it's called the Future

155
00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:49,750
Music

156
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:55,770
credo I'm just gonna reach you a little
bit I believe that the use of Norway's

157
00:09:55,770 --> 00:10:00,520
to make music will continue and increase
until the region music produced through

158
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:02,250
the aid of electrical instruments

159
00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:06,870
which will make it available for musical
purposes

160
00:10:06,870 --> 00:10:12,260
any and all sounds that can be heard for
electric film and mechanical means for

161
00:10:12,260 --> 00:10:14,110
the synthetic production and music

162
00:10:14,110 --> 00:10:18,410
okay

163
00:10:18,410 --> 00:10:23,189
so I'm team four minutes and 33 seconds

164
00:10:23,190 --> 00:10:26,440
I is a piece

165
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:30,339
I just show you the score were David
Tudor set I played it I'm the reason why

166
00:10:30,339 --> 00:10:32,130
this was important not only because it

167
00:10:32,130 --> 00:10:36,709
reemphasizing repossessing repositioned
like to shoppers repositioning

168
00:10:36,709 --> 00:10:40,770
fountain repositioned music as being
something

169
00:10:40,770 --> 00:10:44,589
that isn't necessarily musical something
that exists

170
00:10:44,589 --> 00:10:48,230
on its own in our environment on as

171
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:52,100
a bad because at that phenomenon is
connected to

172
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:56,140
what's called Elliott worker
indeterminate music which is like chance

173
00:10:56,140 --> 00:10:57,130
operations

174
00:10:57,130 --> 00:11:00,630
Duchamp's calling a chance operations
because he was doing this culture

175
00:11:00,630 --> 00:11:04,910
but I'm cage we can calling Italia
torture indeterminate music which

176
00:11:04,910 --> 00:11:06,150
basically just means

177
00:11:06,150 --> 00:11:10,120
you know on the empty empty music like
the empty score

178
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:14,100
that age opened the talk with can accept
any acoustic events

179
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:17,550
okay so and yes so

180
00:11:17,550 --> 00:11:23,130
that their you know that is that's an
accepted acoustic band now

181
00:11:23,130 --> 00:11:27,439
even whether or not it was on purpose on

182
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:31,329
and the next person who sneezes also
okay so

183
00:11:31,329 --> 00:11:34,699
I'm continuing with that the creative
act

184
00:11:34,699 --> 00:11:40,500
this is interesting because an to shop
defines the creative act as I'm not

185
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:42,180
performed by the artists alone

186
00:11:42,180 --> 00:11:46,050
but also that in that the spectator
brings the work in contact with the

187
00:11:46,050 --> 00:11:48,320
external world by deciphering

188
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:52,510
and interpreting its her qualifications
and this adds his contribution

189
00:11:52,510 --> 00:11:56,550
to the creative act as well now this is
really interesting because

190
00:11:56,550 --> 00:12:01,520
the connection %uh 433 and also the
creative act speaks to this idea

191
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:06,189
have to this DIY philosophy actually the
do it yourself philosophy which in the

192
00:12:06,189 --> 00:12:07,079
arts really

193
00:12:07,079 --> 00:12:12,170
at this point means on that dancers
anybody's a dancer

194
00:12:12,170 --> 00:12:15,680
anybody's a musician anybody can take on
any of these

195
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:18,850
time-based forms in this case based on

196
00:12:18,850 --> 00:12:22,709
what these are the legacy these artists
have laughed and

197
00:12:22,709 --> 00:12:26,260
and can do it and I'm

198
00:12:26,260 --> 00:12:29,870
that's also interesting because john
cage before he wrote

199
00:12:29,870 --> 00:12:33,079
four minutes and 33 seconds went to
Harvard

200
00:12:33,079 --> 00:12:37,319
to conduct an experiment by entering it
a soundproof champ chamber an echo

201
00:12:37,319 --> 00:12:38,349
chamber

202
00:12:38,350 --> 00:12:42,410
and just to see what he would hear if
anything

203
00:12:42,410 --> 00:12:45,680
and I'm what he heard worm

204
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:49,449
it was the working at this blood system
and his heart

205
00:12:49,449 --> 00:12:52,550
so under even under those circumstances

206
00:12:52,550 --> 00:12:56,650
and sound is always around us

207
00:12:56,650 --> 00:13:00,490
in fact we are sound generators the that
idea

208
00:13:00,490 --> 00:13:04,319
the ontology at musicians in one
musician ship i think is really what he

209
00:13:04,319 --> 00:13:06,370
was getting at

210
00:13:06,370 --> 00:13:11,329
im so having so bad once I'm society
heard about this for minutes and 33

211
00:13:11,329 --> 00:13:12,480
seconds

212
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:16,069
I'm he and did a

213
00:13:16,069 --> 00:13:20,400
a live performance which I because we
don't have any sound I don't know if

214
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:23,500
it'll work at that'll be in

215
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:26,420
nice to see I guess if you would like to
see it afterwards please come up but

216
00:13:26,420 --> 00:13:29,900
it's really you can watch it on YouTube
its called water lock

217
00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:33,060
I it was actually I'm compose for an
Italian

218
00:13:33,060 --> 00:13:37,110
TV game show on 59 but then he was
requested to perform it on What's My

219
00:13:37,110 --> 00:13:38,850
Line in 1960

220
00:13:38,850 --> 00:13:42,630
so that clip is on youtube.com and I
have it on my laptop if you'd like to

221
00:13:42,630 --> 00:13:43,329
see it

222
00:13:43,329 --> 00:13:47,500
after

223
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:51,650
so I'm in

224
00:13:51,650 --> 00:13:56,260
now I'm based on all this art history

225
00:13:56,260 --> 00:13:59,250
I want to talk about hacking mindset
because I think this is really what

226
00:13:59,250 --> 00:14:01,110
Richard Stallman was getting at

227
00:14:01,110 --> 00:14:04,560
I'm in his article but you know it's you
know

228
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:07,920
hacker doesn't mean this that or the
other thing it's a way of thinking it's

229
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:09,829
a philosophy on some level

230
00:14:09,829 --> 00:14:13,040
so on the connection a playful
cleverness

231
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:16,959
and boundaries and the oblong card is
extremely important

232
00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:21,300
on the on Carter's is a maybe about
boundaries exactly

233
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:25,400
and whether or not it's playful Irwin
whatever you know agenda the artist has

234
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:28,120
it's still about trying to engage those

235
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:31,839
boundaries on so conceptual art

236
00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:35,010
which is idea based and repurpose ang on

237
00:14:35,010 --> 00:14:38,600
and two shots fountain Plaisance that
also well

238
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:42,360
let me read you this a quote from Jerry
salsas are crackin writes for The

239
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:44,709
Village Voice so this really I'm

240
00:14:44,709 --> 00:14:48,589
a looming thing about the fountain

241
00:14:48,589 --> 00:14:52,420
and the founder brings us into contact
with an original that is still in

242
00:14:52,420 --> 00:14:53,470
original but that

243
00:14:53,470 --> 00:14:57,770
also exists in an altered philosophical
on that metaphysical state

244
00:14:57,770 --> 00:15:01,500
on is a manifestation of the continent
sublime

245
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:05,680
the work art to transcend the form but
that is also intelligible

246
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:10,250
an object that strikes down an idea
while allowing it to spring up stronger

247
00:15:10,250 --> 00:15:14,740
so anything I'm I think I could call
hacking conceptual art and repurpose

248
00:15:14,740 --> 00:15:15,180
saying

249
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:19,089
the building a I on top of ideas

250
00:15:19,089 --> 00:15:22,199
even if it's not sculptural I think I'm

251
00:15:22,199 --> 00:15:26,920
you know hackers you know working with
systems and figure out how to you know

252
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:27,620
play

253
00:15:27,620 --> 00:15:30,839
with getting around systems I mean
that's actually building on something

254
00:15:30,839 --> 00:15:33,939
that's like building another system
within a system

255
00:15:33,939 --> 00:15:37,860
and them you know as thats that's kinda
fascinating and

256
00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:42,610
the sociologist bring a little word
talks about this a lot like how do these

257
00:15:42,610 --> 00:15:45,939
digital systems inform other digital
systems because

258
00:15:45,939 --> 00:15:50,900
they're very and much like computational
biological media

259
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:54,459
on some level but they have a life

260
00:15:54,459 --> 00:15:58,240
okay so I'm wrapping up with a hacking
mindset

261
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:01,800
the evolution on it and how it and it's
affecting

262
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:06,029
how artists have taken on these mindsets
I just wanna talk about these binary

263
00:16:06,029 --> 00:16:07,730
oppositions quickly

264
00:16:07,730 --> 00:16:12,970
I'm about the add-on card

265
00:16:12,970 --> 00:16:17,280
so if you know I think there are a lot
of these are kinda vague there live

266
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:20,079
different context that you can apply
these two

267
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:23,910
I'm I mean yes and no binary opposition
correct

268
00:16:23,910 --> 00:16:28,829
incorrect all new mistaken intention now
that that's actually an interesting

269
00:16:28,829 --> 00:16:30,400
inadvertent hack

270
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:34,049
I'm on some level because you know
Richard Stallman

271
00:16:34,049 --> 00:16:37,959
I mean you could say he did that on his
own because it struck him out where

272
00:16:37,959 --> 00:16:41,140
that he just thinks that way that I mean
if people aren't if

273
00:16:41,140 --> 00:16:44,520
you are raised with like a certain you
know chopsticks

274
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:48,160
mean I think I'm pretty good at using
them but you know when I first picked

275
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:48,770
them up

276
00:16:48,770 --> 00:16:54,589
I mean it was not you know and I maybe
pick them up when I was like 25 Sam

277
00:16:54,589 --> 00:16:58,799
I'm a convention or hack or an
innovation

278
00:16:58,799 --> 00:17:03,089
came so that's a long car to one or 0
okay so

279
00:17:03,089 --> 00:17:07,429
having I think and any kind of basic
constructs like this you know when one

280
00:17:07,429 --> 00:17:09,110
thing opposes another

281
00:17:09,110 --> 00:17:16,110
that sorta where at the evolution I'm a
hacking mindset comes I think

282
00:17:21,449 --> 00:17:25,429
re: talked about this little bit byte
just going back to cage to wrap up my

283
00:17:25,429 --> 00:17:26,290
section

284
00:17:26,290 --> 00:17:31,350
at the DIY philosophy and the ontology
and musicians and musicianship

285
00:17:31,350 --> 00:17:34,770
what is a musician an

286
00:17:34,770 --> 00:17:38,179
am white is musicianship really about at
this point

287
00:17:38,179 --> 00:17:41,809
I mean I couldn't make the argument
based on the stock

288
00:17:41,809 --> 00:17:45,260
the right now we're all making music at
the same time

289
00:17:45,260 --> 00:17:48,700
I'm so I think this is really I'm

290
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:53,100
sorted where I'm coming from cage has
inspired inspired this talk about the

291
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:54,960
hacking mindset

292
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:58,740
so thank you very much and Joshua M

293
00:17:58,740 --> 00:18:05,740
is going to speak next

294
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:31,250
hi so I my name's Josh iraq

295
00:18:31,250 --> 00:18:34,500
hours ago by Zen albatross I had been
writing

296
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:39,850
a chip music at four about five or six
years now and I'm gonna going to explain

297
00:18:39,850 --> 00:18:40,660
a little bit about

298
00:18:40,660 --> 00:18:43,960
are what that is and also

299
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:47,280
the the roots that it has in I

300
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:50,870
using software and subversive ways I
which

301
00:18:50,870 --> 00:18:55,030
have over time evolved into becoming in
their own discipline

302
00:18:55,030 --> 00:18:58,060
I completely independent have the

303
00:18:58,060 --> 00:19:01,530
software security and and where the
where they originally

304
00:19:01,530 --> 00:19:05,580
a where they originated and so this is

305
00:19:05,580 --> 00:19:09,429
this is basically my my usual spiel
about

306
00:19:09,430 --> 00:19:12,780
a chip music when people ask me I
essentially

307
00:19:12,780 --> 00:19:16,960
sheet music in the way that I would
describe it as is basically just music

308
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:17,640
made

309
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:22,760
using the sound ships from obsolete
video game consoles and computers now

310
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:25,770
the reason why I guess a a lot of a

311
00:19:25,770 --> 00:19:29,120
a lot of people have been attracted to
this is because this is from

312
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:32,370
appeared in history when computers
actually had

313
00:19:32,370 --> 00:19:35,760
unique sound sets on this is before MIDI

314
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:39,060
before I before any kinda like

315
00:19:39,060 --> 00:19:42,260
cd-quality audio obviously and so

316
00:19:42,260 --> 00:19:46,080
these the sound chips had their own
character

317
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:50,199
and it's become an exploration a
limitations because these

318
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:54,440
sunsets were also trapped within
hardware that was incredibly hard to you

319
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:58,640
manipulate I and with the exception of
the people who originally

320
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:02,410
writing software while or music for this
hardware

321
00:20:02,410 --> 00:20:05,980
I most people didn't get into it until

322
00:20:05,980 --> 00:20:11,000
relatively later on when I interest in
this started coming back up and also

323
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,180
it's on

324
00:20:12,180 --> 00:20:15,860
it's become a diverse sorta
international music scene

325
00:20:15,860 --> 00:20:19,050
hi revolving around people who are

326
00:20:19,050 --> 00:20:23,530
just focused on using these set the
sound pallets in order to construct

327
00:20:23,530 --> 00:20:26,790
new new works I that are completely

328
00:20:26,790 --> 00:20:30,850
I built from within not that run on the
hardware sometimes they cannot run in

329
00:20:30,850 --> 00:20:32,470
the hardware but generally speaking

330
00:20:32,470 --> 00:20:34,960
I when you're talking about your music
you're talking about people who are

331
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:35,890
working with real

332
00:20:35,890 --> 00:20:40,120
with hardware that's basically running
and generating synthesis in real time

333
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:44,890
I and then on the other side a a lot of
confusion sometimes comes where people

334
00:20:44,890 --> 00:20:46,060
just immediately assume that

335
00:20:46,060 --> 00:20:49,960
sheet music is video game music it can
be video game music obviously it was in

336
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:51,630
the eighties when there were a lot of
people

337
00:20:51,630 --> 00:20:55,600
who were making music using these games
but is actually a pretty

338
00:20:55,600 --> 00:21:00,080
three large gap between what you hear in
the original era I love when

339
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:04,169
these the sound chips were being used
when the computers were still

340
00:21:04,170 --> 00:21:07,810
contemporary and what you see now and
the difference

341
00:21:07,810 --> 00:21:11,510
are getting to you in just a second and
another thing is about it being a genre

342
00:21:11,510 --> 00:21:16,360
it can be allowed you'll describe shit
music is a genre I i really see it as

343
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:19,540
Moore Ave have a methodology or a medium

344
00:21:19,540 --> 00:21:23,450
are because you you have no limitations
at

345
00:21:23,450 --> 00:21:26,550
you are very few limitations despite the
limited hardware

346
00:21:26,550 --> 00:21:30,070
as to what kind of sound you can
actually producing I've heard like

347
00:21:30,070 --> 00:21:31,879
country-western music I've heard

348
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:36,140
you know hip hop a.m. you know just
beyond the regular Scopus just dance

349
00:21:36,140 --> 00:21:37,940
music although a large portion of it

350
00:21:37,940 --> 00:21:41,490
winds up being dance music because thats
wanted that one %uh there

351
00:21:41,490 --> 00:21:44,580
easiest ways to get into it is by making
a making

352
00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:48,379
you know 44 sorta for the floor dance
music it can evolve

353
00:21:48,380 --> 00:21:52,060
and it has evolved into a lot of
different other forms as well so

354
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:55,230
I'm of course chip music started when

355
00:21:55,230 --> 00:21:58,500
these old computers came out people were
making software for them I

356
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:02,740
and people are making music for that
software but if you actually go

357
00:22:02,740 --> 00:22:07,690
back to you where where the actual DIY
aspect of people like

358
00:22:07,690 --> 00:22:11,080
who are now contemporary jazz musicians
making this stuff it actually goes back

359
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:11,590
to you

360
00:22:11,590 --> 00:22:16,040
when people wanted shit for free because
they had the software market was just

361
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:19,000
starting up in the eighties and he was
starting to become a viable

362
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:22,160
commercial enterprise and obviously
people

363
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:25,280
we're gonna steal it so when this
happened this

364
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:28,820
but when it first happened the it was
really subtle this is a

365
00:22:28,820 --> 00:22:31,850
early crack and you can tell because its

366
00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:35,740
it's really subtle the aside from the 19
it says cracked by mister Xerox you

367
00:22:35,740 --> 00:22:36,240
can't

368
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:39,570
really tell that this is there's there's
any difference but

369
00:22:39,570 --> 00:22:43,720
the interesting thing is when you start
to see a parallel movement have all that

370
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:44,380
this

371
00:22:44,380 --> 00:22:48,450
when people start I be getting more
creative with this is another one that's

372
00:22:48,450 --> 00:22:49,350
actually pretty

373
00:22:49,350 --> 00:22:53,240
pretty subtle as well I E in this just
looks like I miss pacman screen

374
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:56,350
aside from when you realize that def
your was not

375
00:22:56,350 --> 00:23:00,170
a computer programmer I'm at but

376
00:23:00,170 --> 00:23:04,560
as a good as time goes on it stops being
about

377
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:07,830
cracking software about how fast can you
crack at our

378
00:23:07,830 --> 00:23:11,909
you know how how many quality where's
can you have to really cut

379
00:23:11,910 --> 00:23:16,550
from the earth where's if you also if
you wanted your interest in where's

380
00:23:16,550 --> 00:23:19,960
there's another talk tomorrow I that
some of our friends are putting on about

381
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:20,300
I

382
00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:24,430
art where's for people who are taking
digital art making them to

383
00:23:24,430 --> 00:23:27,720
wares and packaging them up but here i'm
talking about.

384
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:31,100
by basically involving to you

385
00:23:31,100 --> 00:23:34,390
be about mark to be more about how

386
00:23:34,390 --> 00:23:37,510
fancy can you sign your name that's the
best way that I can describe it

387
00:23:37,510 --> 00:23:41,220
where people start concentrating as much
if not more

388
00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:44,340
on the actual presentation out there

389
00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:47,679
up there cracked software then they are
on the crack itself

390
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:51,900
and that's when you start getting into
you things like the demo seen

391
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:55,740
and that's where the demoss incomes from
some just gonna run down on here

392
00:23:55,740 --> 00:24:02,740
on

393
00:24:07,780 --> 00:24:10,920
you can't hear this obviously I thought
we were gonna audio but I guess not

394
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:15,030
but yeah so this is what we're talking
about before but essentially

395
00:24:15,030 --> 00:24:18,270
it this is just this is still a crack
screen but

396
00:24:18,270 --> 00:24:21,710
the line begins to blur at this point
when you start getting people who are

397
00:24:21,710 --> 00:24:24,970
I just taking a lot of time to make

398
00:24:24,970 --> 00:24:28,770
to make the presentation as as slick as
possible

399
00:24:28,770 --> 00:24:31,950
and of course there's of the other stuff
going on like you know

400
00:24:31,950 --> 00:24:35,420
people shouting out to their friends and
and wrapping their crack groups and

401
00:24:35,420 --> 00:24:35,880
whatever

402
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:39,770
but I this is this is where

403
00:24:39,770 --> 00:24:44,050
it starts splitting of to become
something completely not about cracking

404
00:24:44,050 --> 00:24:49,260
and more about creating limitations and
hardware limitation specifically

405
00:24:49,260 --> 00:24:56,260
and see this is an actual demo them and
try and run

406
00:24:57,420 --> 00:25:00,670
so a lot of that

407
00:25:00,670 --> 00:25:04,310
the cracks screen allow the cracked
screens establish some of the techniques

408
00:25:04,310 --> 00:25:05,870
that started to become used

409
00:25:05,870 --> 00:25:08,940
when the demoss seen eventually became
its own thing

410
00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:15,940
and this is a demo by a group called

411
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:20,020
booze design its widely regarded as one
of the most

412
00:25:20,020 --> 00:25:23,389
impressive c64 demise ever released %ah

413
00:25:23,390 --> 00:25:28,050
and its really this is again just sort
of pushing

414
00:25:28,050 --> 00:25:32,909
pushing this is like you know it I mean
this was made much later on after demoss

415
00:25:32,910 --> 00:25:38,020
demonstrator became a thing but when you
pursue it to its like natural conclusion

416
00:25:38,020 --> 00:25:41,290
it starts being prime like entirely
about

417
00:25:41,290 --> 00:25:44,600
just like how much how much code can I
crunch

418
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:48,170
how much you know how many gummy like
impressive

419
00:25:48,170 --> 00:25:53,000
scroll the shits can I do that make it
you know as as impressive as possible

420
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,780
and at this point it's because it has
nothing to do with cracking

421
00:25:55,780 --> 00:25:59,170
although it still does have to do with
packing because it's basically

422
00:25:59,170 --> 00:26:02,640
just trying to find loopholes to you to
make

423
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:05,960
as an impressive amount of thing when
everyone is on the same

424
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:09,260
the same sort of playing field and
that's

425
00:26:09,260 --> 00:26:12,340
online go back to this

426
00:26:12,340 --> 00:26:18,210
to expand this

427
00:26:18,210 --> 00:26:21,580
yet so this is when we get into the
demoss in which is

428
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:26,050
I does anyone not familiar to demoss in
okay a couple people

429
00:26:26,050 --> 00:26:29,190
so the demoss in essentially was what I
was just describing as this

430
00:26:29,190 --> 00:26:33,290
movement of artists that word is a curse
before mostly before the internet so

431
00:26:33,290 --> 00:26:36,899
they they communicated mostly through
trade shows and and meet-ups

432
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:40,570
and they traded their demise on desks
done diskettes

433
00:26:40,570 --> 00:26:43,580
and basically this was all

434
00:26:43,580 --> 00:26:47,480
done sir either BBS oren or you know I R
L

435
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:50,660
through meet ups and what not and
basically the important thing about this

436
00:26:50,660 --> 00:26:51,180
was that

437
00:26:51,180 --> 00:26:54,770
the the competition aspect that came out
of that was because

438
00:26:54,770 --> 00:26:59,270
everyone had this hardware and it was
all the same hardware so

439
00:26:59,270 --> 00:27:02,800
it was very easy to see who was more
skilled

440
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:06,550
and who is not a skill because at your
work and a c64

441
00:27:06,550 --> 00:27:09,760
generally speaking you're working with
the same hardware limitations as

442
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:10,900
everyone else and so

443
00:27:10,900 --> 00:27:14,930
this is where it sorted became kind of
competitive but also artistic in the

444
00:27:14,930 --> 00:27:16,490
same time because it involved

445
00:27:16,490 --> 00:27:20,070
people using I like what what stalin was
mentioning

446
00:27:20,070 --> 00:27:24,649
a a creative mindset to you approach the
computer in order to make something

447
00:27:24,650 --> 00:27:28,940
that becomes in it in some
interpretations an artistic work

448
00:27:28,940 --> 00:27:32,130
and this is a REI a a demo

449
00:27:32,130 --> 00:27:35,560
a very famous demo by agriculture jerker
called second reality if you're not

450
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:36,419
familiar with it

451
00:27:36,420 --> 00:27:39,990
died this is pretty much all you need to
know in terms of the demo scene

452
00:27:39,990 --> 00:27:43,600
well it's not all you need to know but
its it's a pretty good example %uh

453
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:47,070
exactly what the demoss seen evolved
into you at some point

454
00:27:47,070 --> 00:27:50,700
%ah their worst when this democrat not
at like blue people's minds

455
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:54,690
and so this this goes back to the

456
00:27:54,690 --> 00:27:58,320
these variations on this dogma which has
gotten repeated a million and one times

457
00:27:58,320 --> 00:27:59,200
throughout history

458
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:02,280
and stahlman mentions it in the on
hacking piece that we mentioned before

459
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:02,840
is

460
00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:07,160
in the the if the idea that a hacking is
a means of exploring the limits of

461
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:08,090
what's possible

462
00:28:08,090 --> 00:28:11,620
and then %uh the second quote being from
Jordan actor who is the creator printer

463
00:28:11,620 --> 00:28:12,240
Persia

464
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:15,660
who actually saw at a at a talk they did
and why you recently

465
00:28:15,660 --> 00:28:19,160
and he he mentioned this also and it was
actually kind of interesting because he

466
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:20,240
was talking about

467
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:23,430
how when he made France a Persia
although is sort of a late in the game

468
00:28:23,430 --> 00:28:24,730
Apple to software

469
00:28:24,730 --> 00:28:28,810
he on there was there's still only 48 K

470
00:28:28,810 --> 00:28:32,929
have memory that you can use to program
this and some other aspects of the game

471
00:28:32,930 --> 00:28:36,440
such as the idea that there is assertive
cam billion confrontation with your

472
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:37,600
shadow self

473
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:41,890
at the vere like near the game's
conclusion where were born entirely up

474
00:28:41,890 --> 00:28:45,280
the idea that he just didn't have enough
memory after he had recorded

475
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:48,030
I don't know if you actually know that
prince purchase so you know how tall the

476
00:28:48,030 --> 00:28:50,879
movements are like fluid if you've seen
Prince Persia you notice that like the

477
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:52,390
character animations are really fluid

478
00:28:52,390 --> 00:28:56,710
that's because he filmed his brother II
jumping and grabbing onto ledges

479
00:28:56,710 --> 00:28:59,990
and then traced over every single frame
individually

480
00:28:59,990 --> 00:29:04,870
and use dot as the character animation
and that took up a lot of memory and so

481
00:29:04,870 --> 00:29:08,800
that that that sort of CAM billion
camper confrontation that he

482
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:12,240
that he puts into the game is a direct
result of him not having enough memory

483
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:15,460
and it actually ones at making the game
more interesting

484
00:29:15,460 --> 00:29:19,270
I'm so why like when I got into chat
music initially it was around the same

485
00:29:19,270 --> 00:29:21,629
time that I saw this film and I highly
recommend

486
00:29:21,630 --> 00:29:25,440
you that you watch this film he ever
have a chance call the five obstructions

487
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:29,230
and its I it focuses on a Danish
filmmaker named Lars von Trier

488
00:29:29,230 --> 00:29:32,830
hearing it made this film in the 1960s
called the perfect human

489
00:29:32,830 --> 00:29:37,020
and in the film basically his I his

490
00:29:37,020 --> 00:29:40,040
I i guesses on his pupil

491
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:43,330
this guy name you're going left are
challenges in to remake the film five

492
00:29:43,330 --> 00:29:44,220
times

493
00:29:44,220 --> 00:29:48,390
and each time there's another set have
limitations that he has to abide by

494
00:29:48,390 --> 00:29:51,840
and some %uh these are something more
interesting ones are for example

495
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:55,360
that every shot can only be 12 frames
law

496
00:29:55,360 --> 00:30:00,150
and then there's another scene where he
has to you I reshoot the entire

497
00:30:00,150 --> 00:30:04,340
the entire film in I the slums of Mumbai
which is one the most impoverished areas

498
00:30:04,340 --> 00:30:05,070
the world

499
00:30:05,070 --> 00:30:08,679
and there's a lot of scenes in the in
the original film that make that

500
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:12,190
serve very a very striking image to see
one thinks

501
00:30:12,190 --> 00:30:16,470
try superimposed over another and in
when I look back at this in retrospect I

502
00:30:16,470 --> 00:30:18,020
realize that this is essentially

503
00:30:18,020 --> 00:30:21,080
the cinematic equivalent to packing and
even though the

504
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:24,460
the limitations here arbitrary as
compare as compared to the

505
00:30:24,460 --> 00:30:27,840
that the demoss imitations which are
technical I feel like that there's a lot

506
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:30,080
of overlap with those two things

507
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:34,370
and so now I'm gonna go so this is
basically primarily what I it when I use

508
00:30:34,370 --> 00:30:34,760
which

509
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:37,650
with the way that I got into music was
through the Game Boy and some going to

510
00:30:37,650 --> 00:30:38,940
use it as an example

511
00:30:38,940 --> 00:30:41,940
I i've the hardware side of things and
so

512
00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:45,330
there there's a lot of problems and a
lot of hacks that you can

513
00:30:45,330 --> 00:30:49,360
that you can I use to approach those
problems when you go into using a

514
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:50,040
gameboy

515
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:54,230
the problem main problem is there's only
four four channels have stereo sound

516
00:30:54,230 --> 00:30:57,760
which is the the stereo part is actually
important but yeah the

517
00:30:57,760 --> 00:31:01,879
the four channels are basically two
possible channels which are the sort of

518
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:04,980
like if you think about a bit music
anything but those flat towns

519
00:31:04,980 --> 00:31:08,120
that's generally what they are there's
two channels have those and and it

520
00:31:08,120 --> 00:31:10,700
can do really good melody but
unfortunately it doesn't have a lot of

521
00:31:10,700 --> 00:31:11,660
character

522
00:31:11,660 --> 00:31:15,320
unless you start manipulating then the
third channel is a wave channel which

523
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:19,720
basically is like a sixteen step
sequencer in like a a mini 616 step

524
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:21,510
sequencer the consent of things

525
00:31:21,510 --> 00:31:25,180
but the only problem with that is that
although it has a lot it's good for bass

526
00:31:25,180 --> 00:31:27,220
and it can generate a lot of good
textures

527
00:31:27,220 --> 00:31:31,370
you're only you only have three volume
control settings that you can adjust

528
00:31:31,370 --> 00:31:34,920
in the tracker at any one time a trucker
by the way is that the

529
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:39,180
upper right is a screenshot have the
tracker called LSDJ which was invented

530
00:31:39,180 --> 00:31:41,480
by the Scot error created I should say

531
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:44,710
by this guy named Johan kaminsky who is
from sweden

532
00:31:44,710 --> 00:31:48,410
and he made that in about 2000 or 2001

533
00:31:48,410 --> 00:31:52,200
and this is this is basically the first
are widely available software that

534
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:53,430
enable people to make

535
00:31:53,430 --> 00:31:57,070
game one music and so even though
they're all these problems with the game

536
00:31:57,070 --> 00:31:57,730
ways

537
00:31:57,730 --> 00:32:01,960
hardware I overtime in this is what
separates the people we started making

538
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:05,510
this music initially for games and the
people who are doing it

539
00:32:05,510 --> 00:32:09,020
right now is that people over time it
figured out all these tracks

540
00:32:09,020 --> 00:32:12,820
which i think is totally analogous to
what you wind up doing

541
00:32:12,820 --> 00:32:15,919
I whether you're cracking or just
programming or whatever

542
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:19,880
is that you find ways around things and
so for example one of the

543
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:23,270
the ways that you can make the sound
sort of some more more whole

544
00:32:23,270 --> 00:32:26,290
is by creating this echo effect and its

545
00:32:26,290 --> 00:32:29,409
it's actually pretty simple when you
consider like when you think about what

546
00:32:29,410 --> 00:32:30,230
an ACO is

547
00:32:30,230 --> 00:32:33,500
echo is something originating in one
place and then

548
00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:37,500
moving or seeming to move II to another
location

549
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:41,590
and getting softer in doing so and so
she just the approach it like that

550
00:32:41,590 --> 00:32:45,860
your you can do that in the Gameboy
software by just creating a software

551
00:32:45,860 --> 00:32:46,560
instrument

552
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:50,850
that hands from right to left or from
senator laughter from senator right or

553
00:32:50,850 --> 00:32:51,760
whatever

554
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:54,780
and then making not echo again

555
00:32:54,780 --> 00:32:58,060
softer hi when it when it repeats

556
00:32:58,060 --> 00:33:01,090
so it's just repeating the same thing up
but

557
00:33:01,090 --> 00:33:03,930
bring different properties on it the
second time and it's interesting how you

558
00:33:03,930 --> 00:33:04,780
can get that

559
00:33:04,780 --> 00:33:08,460
to you make it seem like you're actually
hearing echo but not

560
00:33:08,460 --> 00:33:11,710
your you're just hearing basically a
hack and then the other

561
00:33:11,710 --> 00:33:14,850
example would be rapidly shifting the
timbre the

562
00:33:14,850 --> 00:33:18,860
the possums which so there's like
several different widths

563
00:33:18,860 --> 00:33:22,600
its I wish I could like give you an
example audio wise but we don't seem to

564
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:23,730
have an audio jack but

565
00:33:23,730 --> 00:33:29,250
basically that the game was cable about
three or 3.5 actually different

566
00:33:29,250 --> 00:33:33,670
kind september's step also leaves are
and I'm

567
00:33:33,670 --> 00:33:37,330
you can ship between them rapidly to
generate like a more interesting texture

568
00:33:37,330 --> 00:33:38,520
and so that's another thing

569
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:41,889
these are just a couple of examples
there's so many I

570
00:33:41,890 --> 00:33:45,310
there's so many different exploits or
whatever you want to call them that

571
00:33:45,310 --> 00:33:48,570
people have found over time to make the
sound more interesting

572
00:33:48,570 --> 00:33:52,720
%ah but yet in general just thinking
about what real sound sounds like

573
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:56,570
and then sort of taking limited
structure of the software

574
00:33:56,570 --> 00:34:00,610
and applying it to you make it sound
like that

575
00:34:00,610 --> 00:34:05,380
I okay and so this is basically the
conclusion and it really just sort of

576
00:34:05,380 --> 00:34:08,670
I touches on a lot of lessons that
overlap into chip music

577
00:34:08,670 --> 00:34:11,670
and mr. CNN hacking in general in
programming in general

578
00:34:11,670 --> 00:34:15,130
is that there the the main idea being
that

579
00:34:15,130 --> 00:34:18,590
constantly repeated dogma that
limitations are powerful they have a

580
00:34:18,590 --> 00:34:20,660
great greater creative output Nats

581
00:34:20,659 --> 00:34:24,399
evidence if you look at any kind of
example of dem a scene or chip music

582
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:27,740
as it stands today as compared to how it
was when it start

583
00:34:27,740 --> 00:34:31,120
when it started and then the other the
other thing being

584
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:34,770
always pressure craft to limit no matter
what which in these categories it falls

585
00:34:34,770 --> 00:34:35,759
under and

586
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:38,830
obviously this is something that a lot
of programmers I know are very familiar

587
00:34:38,830 --> 00:34:42,330
with is that the easiest way to do
something isn't always the best in fact

588
00:34:42,330 --> 00:34:46,110
sometimes you wind up getting a lot
better results if you approach something

589
00:34:46,110 --> 00:34:46,470
that

590
00:34:46,470 --> 00:34:49,650
from I like among a much more difficult

591
00:34:49,650 --> 00:34:53,210
a air angle and then you wind up getting
more interesting is all

592
00:34:53,210 --> 00:34:57,550
and then the other thing being about
gear I've never liked here but mostly

593
00:34:57,550 --> 00:35:00,060
because for a while when I started
making

594
00:35:00,060 --> 00:35:04,270
a chip music I was really fucking poor
and sell I had no cure to work with but

595
00:35:04,270 --> 00:35:05,120
I had a gameboy

596
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:08,650
and so not I think that limitation if
not

597
00:35:08,650 --> 00:35:12,050
you know sort of splurging and buying a
lot of equipment can be really

598
00:35:12,050 --> 00:35:13,940
liberating in the end because you

599
00:35:13,940 --> 00:35:17,290
use or give learn to work there's
actually a whole artistic movement

600
00:35:17,290 --> 00:35:19,150
that's devoted to tackle brick a lodge
where

601
00:35:19,150 --> 00:35:24,140
thats I involving using materials that
are immediately accessible to you

602
00:35:24,140 --> 00:35:28,000
and then the last thing being something
that a lot of people I'm sure here can

603
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:31,420
agree with is that computers and
electronics need to always be used as

604
00:35:31,420 --> 00:35:32,940
you see fit and not how

605
00:35:32,940 --> 00:35:36,320
corporations and the people who
manufacture them tell you to use them

606
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:39,530
and all those things basically result in
in

607
00:35:39,530 --> 00:35:43,110
way more II way more interesting
compositions and

608
00:35:43,110 --> 00:35:46,410
way more and we moorlach you know just

609
00:35:46,410 --> 00:35:50,149
more creativity in general so that's
about it

610
00:35:50,150 --> 00:35:55,270
for me thanks

611
00:35:55,270 --> 00:35:58,800
you have time ask guess what I just
found

612
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:02,880
just found hysteria and Minister Aniston

613
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:06,300
yeah I'm

614
00:36:06,300 --> 00:36:09,390
so you wanna plugin yeah

615
00:36:09,390 --> 00:36:13,720
I'm so Josh up when you go ahead and
here and give your

616
00:36:13,720 --> 00:36:16,840
give your example and all are to the
wall and then

617
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:23,840
Nikki will go and then I'll play the
water walk at the end of the TOC

618
00:36:26,220 --> 00:36:30,120
so I wish that there was a better way to
visualize what on a gameboy screen

619
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:33,819
I but unfortunately the only really good
really easy way to do that is by working

620
00:36:33,820 --> 00:36:37,480
in an emulator and last night I was
trying to make that happen

621
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:42,190
and I just can't and I did not have the
you know control pad USB thing

622
00:36:42,190 --> 00:36:45,850
and during on the keyboard is just so
infuriating so

623
00:36:45,850 --> 00:36:49,009
I I'm gonna have to endure here but you
can hear the difference

624
00:36:49,010 --> 00:36:52,400
what i'm talking about. so and

625
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:55,500
I guess I can try and go back to that

626
00:36:55,500 --> 00:37:00,510
that interface to see you know what i'm
looking at right now

627
00:37:00,510 --> 00:37:05,990
yet this interface right here

628
00:37:05,990 --> 00:37:09,560
yet so that interface on the operate is
what I'm looking at and basically

629
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:12,920
the reason why game for me that the game
where tracker so a tracker is

630
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:14,250
essentially just a sequencer

631
00:37:14,250 --> 00:37:17,380
it's a I a musical sequencer that it has

632
00:37:17,380 --> 00:37:20,590
rows and columns and essentially what
you're doing is hex editing

633
00:37:20,590 --> 00:37:24,110
when you're when you're working in LST
day this program II

634
00:37:24,110 --> 00:37:27,360
because everything is represented by hex
values and the only thing is confusing

635
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:30,420
about it to anybody looking at it for
the first time is the fact that

636
00:37:30,420 --> 00:37:34,520
all the screens are broken up I not
everything is all on one screen like

637
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:35,740
much trackers are so

638
00:37:35,740 --> 00:37:39,180
you need to sort of like it's all
hierarchical you need to go from the

639
00:37:39,180 --> 00:37:41,149
first screen which just has a list if

640
00:37:41,150 --> 00:37:44,220
I've a a hexadecimal pairings which are
just

641
00:37:44,220 --> 00:37:48,820
linking two phrases which are linking to
actual measures with notes in them

642
00:37:48,820 --> 00:37:53,900
and so I guess artists there's no real
way of showing it happened at

643
00:37:53,900 --> 00:38:00,300
and visual type thing but I'm gonna go
in here and just

644
00:38:00,300 --> 00:38:06,220
hear that commit turn their volume
control

645
00:38:06,220 --> 00:38:09,830
well this is all important thing i now
I'm

646
00:38:09,830 --> 00:38:14,350
is there I'm control now

647
00:38:14,350 --> 00:38:19,140
great will ya to listen really carefully

648
00:38:19,140 --> 00:38:21,920
alright so that is if you can hear that

649
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:25,710
that's a 12 point five percent school I
square wave

650
00:38:25,710 --> 00:38:29,869
is the most basic sound you can ever
hear coming from a gameboy

651
00:38:29,869 --> 00:38:33,040
now if you change it to

652
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:36,259
make the with the it's basically the
frequency of the waveform that's

653
00:38:36,260 --> 00:38:36,849
changing

654
00:38:36,849 --> 00:38:39,990
how frequently it's repeating so if you
make it repeated

655
00:38:39,990 --> 00:38:44,300
less often you start getting different
time

656
00:38:44,300 --> 00:38:49,359
and I totally I'm so sorry anybody can
hear that but like

657
00:38:49,359 --> 00:38:52,529
its dear diz every here different okay

658
00:38:52,530 --> 00:38:56,300
area alright so again

659
00:38:56,300 --> 00:38:58,550
12 percent

660
00:38:58,550 --> 00:39:02,120
25 percent

661
00:39:02,120 --> 00:39:05,480
fifty percent say here that it's like a
different it's a change in the

662
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:09,110
the the the actual timbre a square wave
but

663
00:39:09,110 --> 00:39:12,110
that thing that's interesting is when
did you start

664
00:39:12,110 --> 00:39:15,180
cycling that so

665
00:39:15,180 --> 00:39:18,230
the way he do that is he right serve a
subir team which

666
00:39:18,230 --> 00:39:22,140
basically which is called the table as
the day and

667
00:39:22,140 --> 00:39:25,790
by doing that you can have these three
wits

668
00:39:25,790 --> 00:39:29,700
cycle

669
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:33,670
so that creates a more interesting
gambar but also you can make it not so

670
00:39:33,670 --> 00:39:34,480
my garbage

671
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:37,670
and you something like this

672
00:39:37,670 --> 00:39:43,670
so that every time it gets hit have
become really fast doing this but

673
00:39:43,670 --> 00:39:50,670
apparently not fast enough

674
00:40:06,340 --> 00:40:08,599
so that's just one thing I and then

675
00:40:08,599 --> 00:40:11,890
there's all kinds of other that but I
don't wanna T hines

676
00:40:11,890 --> 00:40:15,430
I just wanted to make you hear that so
that you understand that I

677
00:40:15,430 --> 00:40:18,470
the similarities party where you when
you're working with them

678
00:40:18,470 --> 00:40:22,210
has essentially what you're doing the
with the way we always explain anyone

679
00:40:22,210 --> 00:40:24,130
hit interested in using the software

680
00:40:24,130 --> 00:40:27,180
is it has more in common with
programming than it does with writing

681
00:40:27,180 --> 00:40:28,220
music on staff

682
00:40:28,220 --> 00:40:31,369
and that you intimidate a lot of people
but I hope like you you ever get a

683
00:40:31,369 --> 00:40:33,030
chance to try all this TJ

684
00:40:33,030 --> 00:40:37,530
I'm sure that like and like mmm if most
people in this room if not all

685
00:40:37,530 --> 00:40:40,630
probably catch on to it pretty pretty
easily the only thing that takes some

686
00:40:40,630 --> 00:40:43,500
getting used to as the fact that
everything is in a split everywhere

687
00:40:43,500 --> 00:40:50,500
and broken up but yeah thanks

688
00:40:54,410 --> 00:40:58,629
Tasha's great and I i just want to say a
quick word before

689
00:40:58,630 --> 00:41:02,390
I'm Nicole comes up here but and there
is a chip is a concert tonight

690
00:41:02,390 --> 00:41:05,500
actually I'm downstairs on the first
floor

691
00:41:05,500 --> 00:41:08,740
I'm in the pavilion at the hotel and
which

692
00:41:08,740 --> 00:41:12,060
I highly recommend am we have a

693
00:41:12,060 --> 00:41:16,450
I an old-school pioneer who's here from
Sweden

694
00:41:16,450 --> 00:41:19,470
named positron so the special treat to
catch an

695
00:41:19,470 --> 00:41:22,780
I'm also going to be playing I'm and

696
00:41:22,780 --> 00:41:25,930
to other artists minus baby and I

697
00:41:25,930 --> 00:41:29,230
cell CMYK so would be great to see you
there

698
00:41:29,230 --> 00:41:33,630
I'm thanks you at ten o'clock

699
00:41:33,630 --> 00:41:40,630
10 sharp

700
00:42:06,470 --> 00:42:13,470
hi

701
00:42:23,010 --> 00:42:30,010
composer

702
00:42:43,340 --> 00:42:45,680
0 side from

703
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:49,899
so %uh her hiking I got into this

704
00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:52,940
after grad school because I realized I
was poor

705
00:42:52,940 --> 00:42:57,490
in grad school head relief and the
studio to work and the

706
00:42:57,490 --> 00:43:01,340
awesome software/hardware anything I
wanted at my disposal

707
00:43:01,340 --> 00:43:04,570
and then I find myself living in a
farmhouse

708
00:43:04,570 --> 00:43:07,760
was mine had pretty much nothing

709
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:11,060
to create all that awesome music with
two-headed

710
00:43:11,060 --> 00:43:14,259
figure out what i was gonna do house
again still make music

711
00:43:14,260 --> 00:43:18,360
composer so I picked up a book Nicolas
Collins

712
00:43:18,360 --> 00:43:22,570
kinda be pretty much change my life so
here we are today

713
00:43:22,570 --> 00:43:25,860
hardware hacking for the musician and
what it's really about which

714
00:43:25,860 --> 00:43:31,020
is yeah exercising your right to be
artist not just a musician

715
00:43:31,020 --> 00:43:34,920
but multimedia artist mixed so

716
00:43:34,920 --> 00:43:39,210
yeah electronic music me toca hardware
hacking

717
00:43:39,210 --> 00:43:42,600
I'll wear covering a lot of ground as

718
00:43:42,600 --> 00:43:46,980
TEM image we have cage a to camp

719
00:43:46,980 --> 00:43:51,110
contemporary seventies they were using
non physical devices

720
00:43:51,110 --> 00:43:54,650
instrument on anybody with cartridge
music

721
00:43:54,650 --> 00:43:59,100
cage Arctic so they're using

722
00:43:59,100 --> 00:44:02,560
cartridges from record players to you
play

723
00:44:02,560 --> 00:44:06,410
like others hand

724
00:44:06,410 --> 00:44:09,670
new weird non school every day

725
00:44:09,670 --> 00:44:13,400
earthly thing you can pick up to and the
fight makes out

726
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:18,880
head composers inside electronics

727
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:24,060
collected lecture based in New York City

728
00:44:24,060 --> 00:44:28,120
founded in 1973 still active today other
notable

729
00:44:28,120 --> 00:44:33,630
women to date with this group

730
00:44:33,630 --> 00:44:40,630
okay give you

731
00:44:44,780 --> 00:44:51,780
what's happening

732
00:44:54,359 --> 00:44:57,430
so screw

733
00:44:57,430 --> 00:45:02,269
bill sculpture using stews

734
00:45:02,269 --> 00:45:07,380
to because our fixed

735
00:45:07,380 --> 00:45:12,440
scopes airplane sculptures

736
00:45:12,440 --> 00:45:19,440
are this is last summer

737
00:45:21,089 --> 00:45:28,089
which the to help

738
00:45:28,350 --> 00:45:32,480
art buddy

739
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:35,740
they take this

740
00:45:35,740 --> 00:45:40,920
pieces

741
00:45:40,920 --> 00:45:45,180
to live

742
00:45:45,180 --> 00:45:50,000
aside works

743
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:57,000
using secretary

744
00:46:15,400 --> 00:46:18,620
okay so next circuit bending

745
00:46:18,620 --> 00:46:25,620
because Allah now we're turning on into
instruments example

746
00:46:27,180 --> 00:46:30,910
this is Dora the Explorer she mentor
teacher

747
00:46:30,910 --> 00:46:33,970
kid how to speak Spanish say

748
00:46:33,970 --> 00:46:39,770
backpack in and Spanish call

749
00:46:39,770 --> 00:46:43,370
not not amused she she has little

750
00:46:43,370 --> 00:46:46,580
Sounders songs that

751
00:46:46,580 --> 00:46:49,730
but it was meant not meant to

752
00:46:49,730 --> 00:46:54,270
like and make we're talking about
circuit bending

753
00:46:54,270 --> 00:46:57,610
turning on into

754
00:46:57,610 --> 00:47:00,640
and

755
00:47:00,640 --> 00:47:04,650
mix

756
00:47:04,650 --> 00:47:08,120
with Collins have creating instruments
from

757
00:47:08,120 --> 00:47:11,710
consumer electronics that 5

758
00:47:11,710 --> 00:47:18,710
digital lot ship a box built

759
00:47:23,110 --> 00:47:30,110
years ago san Nicolas Collins wrote the
book

760
00:47:30,160 --> 00:47:34,670
hardware hacking modern hardware hacking
and how to make instruments for yourself

761
00:47:34,670 --> 00:47:38,820
ways boxes that don't cost you this much
synthesizer

762
00:47:38,820 --> 00:47:45,820
because really you can afford that
microcontrollers

763
00:47:54,440 --> 00:47:58,560
between a BASIC Stamp revolution
everybody's using Arduino now I

764
00:47:58,560 --> 00:48:02,099
being feels like it everybody art now
for something

765
00:48:02,099 --> 00:48:05,290
alright haha now you know

766
00:48:05,290 --> 00:48:08,940
now we're combining and environmental
sensors as well as

767
00:48:08,940 --> 00:48:13,119
I digital logic chips the other

768
00:48:13,119 --> 00:48:16,480
the the other guys Davis to create

769
00:48:16,480 --> 00:48:19,930
controllers self this is actually

770
00:48:19,930 --> 00:48:24,069
why I do mostly I bill controller

771
00:48:24,069 --> 00:48:29,500
objects artist that you will help that
everybody

772
00:48:29,500 --> 00:48:32,730
cider

773
00:48:32,730 --> 00:48:38,109
you can nation here

774
00:48:38,109 --> 00:48:41,848
can give you background in circuit
bending

775
00:48:41,849 --> 00:48:45,380
like thing to get people into

776
00:48:45,380 --> 00:48:48,400
electronics for musicians that is

777
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:52,700
circuit bending short-circuiting
electronics for the purpose of creating

778
00:48:52,700 --> 00:48:54,770
sound effects that are not part of the

779
00:48:54,770 --> 00:48:59,339
original circuit design so what we're
doing is we're making an attendant

780
00:48:59,339 --> 00:49:05,970
point to produce electronic sounds in
her

781
00:49:05,970 --> 00:49:09,099
in those boxers love extra wires

782
00:49:09,099 --> 00:49:12,109
extra to point things it maker

783
00:49:12,109 --> 00:49:15,770
not Texas Instruments maker didn't and

784
00:49:15,770 --> 00:49:20,180
fit into her to quit shell and to make

785
00:49:20,180 --> 00:49:27,180
James but now we can make her do that

786
00:49:33,849 --> 00:49:35,660
the most common thing people to ban

787
00:49:35,660 --> 00:49:39,180
our children's such as sheens

788
00:49:39,180 --> 00:49:46,180
the comment word Casio sq

789
00:49:47,670 --> 00:49:54,290
popular so what's the difference

790
00:49:54,290 --> 00:49:58,300
circuit bending it again talkin to
friends

791
00:49:58,300 --> 00:50:02,559
processes and techniques spending
modification

792
00:50:02,559 --> 00:50:06,270
bending the process exploration

793
00:50:06,270 --> 00:50:11,890
no outcome this is much like easy and
cheap

794
00:50:11,890 --> 00:50:17,509
no intentions which is gonna stick on
the contact point and see what happens

795
00:50:17,510 --> 00:50:24,510
modification to demonstrate these
controls

796
00:50:24,819 --> 00:50:30,819
there which point point pitch

797
00:50:30,819 --> 00:50:37,819
I found most

798
00:50:47,160 --> 00:50:54,160
will you be there I second tell you that

799
00:50:59,049 --> 00:51:02,240
okay so well

800
00:51:02,240 --> 00:51:06,270
to me that now if you have any questions
later

801
00:51:06,270 --> 00:51:10,339
you can check out the flames I would
love to show you my other

802
00:51:10,339 --> 00:51:17,339
current work

803
00:51:18,210 --> 00:51:18,780
thank you

804
00:51:18,780 --> 00:51:24,310
I'm like I said for if you want to if
you have any questions or you want to

805
00:51:24,310 --> 00:51:27,500
talk to us I believe the Yes Men are not
speaking in this room so

806
00:51:27,500 --> 00:51:28,250
I mean they're tele
