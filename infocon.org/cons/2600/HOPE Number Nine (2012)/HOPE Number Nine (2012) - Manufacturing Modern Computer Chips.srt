1
00:00:00,049 --> 00:00:03,060
slight the second side um for anybody
who just walked in

2
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:06,439
I'm tight Fernandes mud I have a handle

3
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:10,000
in the program I don't care I just
really didn't want my name associated

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:10,750
with this

5
00:00:10,750 --> 00:00:14,320
on the web on so money's tight Fernandez
I'm here talk about

6
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:18,279
semiconductors %uh is a QR code on here
if you want to follow along

7
00:00:18,279 --> 00:00:21,560
on your iPad a Android device or other

8
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:25,400
I going like that'll take your Dropbox
and you can follow along on slides

9
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:28,859
so I called inseparable from magic thats
I'm

10
00:00:28,859 --> 00:00:32,349
as an end I'm an engineer I kinda find
the term magic a little bit insulting

11
00:00:32,349 --> 00:00:33,600
when people refer to my work

12
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:37,260
re: or the work of other engineers on
because it's not magic

13
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:41,010
its sweat implied and mental stability

14
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:44,640
that goes into these things to make them
work I use the term several magic

15
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:45,300
because

16
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:48,530
from working in the industry I can tell
you that's a fairly standard response

17
00:00:48,530 --> 00:00:52,050
a what happened we don't know why does
it work

18
00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:55,430
it's magic on that's from the people who
now sup

19
00:00:55,430 --> 00:00:59,210
inseparable from at cal/osha looking at
here is the first

20
00:00:59,210 --> 00:01:03,120
ever solid-state transistor Bell Labs
1947

21
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:06,930
if you haven't read the book the Idea
Factory it talks about this in detail

22
00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:10,350
it's incredible on so disclaimers not

23
00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:13,799
read the disclaimer I'm gonna talk about
something else um

24
00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:17,119
family time p.m. for questions if you
have a question

25
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:20,170
everything has a slight number in the
bottom right which we can actually see

26
00:01:20,170 --> 00:01:21,140
which is fantastic

27
00:01:21,140 --> 00:01:24,420
please reference the slide number helps
me out with the answer your question

28
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:27,770
more detail I'm at the end if you missed
the download link

29
00:01:27,770 --> 00:01:31,429
I have the download link people who are
the six just audio there's a download

30
00:01:31,430 --> 00:01:32,070
link at the end

31
00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:35,689
I will read out I hate that this light
is necessary but

32
00:01:35,689 --> 00:01:39,310
semiconductor companies are kind of me

33
00:01:39,310 --> 00:01:43,079
the federal government look silly in
terms of IP security and like I said

34
00:01:43,079 --> 00:01:46,450
I like this industry to work for so this
is me

35
00:01:46,450 --> 00:01:49,680
I have the degree in mechanical
engineering at work in four different

36
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:50,869
facets of work in a

37
00:01:50,869 --> 00:01:54,009
wide range weird things from by
chromatography to

38
00:01:54,009 --> 00:01:58,149
I micro metrology too thin films
deposition to what we call yield

39
00:01:58,149 --> 00:01:58,890
analysis

40
00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:03,110
I've worked in the range of things from
academic research to

41
00:02:03,110 --> 00:02:06,579
development to production thats me at
work

42
00:02:06,579 --> 00:02:10,520
so I played out attach I shouldn't have
that picture

43
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:13,620
that's a diff story sup what we talk
about

44
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:17,090
was still statistics first um this is a
human hair

45
00:02:17,090 --> 00:02:22,010
upscale 40 micron diameter human hair
that's a fairly average human hair

46
00:02:22,010 --> 00:02:25,069
in 1971 Intel ready released the

47
00:02:25,069 --> 00:02:29,270
Intel four thousand and four that was a
10 micron

48
00:02:29,270 --> 00:02:32,720
device %uh line size so that's

49
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:36,400
a scale 10 Mike that's in 1971

50
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:40,200
here's 1990 806

51
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:43,530
here's 2000 138 meters

52
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:46,550
can everybody see that dot if you can
see that dot

53
00:02:46,550 --> 00:02:50,099
raise your hand okay there's a dot there

54
00:02:50,099 --> 00:02:53,359
that's 2010

55
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:56,989
two years ago um 13 at a mere

56
00:02:56,989 --> 00:03:00,390
is in relation to human hair a week

57
00:03:00,390 --> 00:03:04,150
I did the math at one point you can put
something like a gigabyte of information

58
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:06,330
nowadays you could store gigabyte in a
human hair

59
00:03:06,330 --> 00:03:09,970
with modern transistor technology on

60
00:03:09,970 --> 00:03:13,680
so this is the basis as whom do we know
how a transistor works

61
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:17,260
self-destruct from a semiconductor
solid-state physics am point there are

62
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:17,819
six

63
00:03:17,819 --> 00:03:22,170
major parts to a transistor you
substrate that is the silicon wafer the

64
00:03:22,170 --> 00:03:25,980
the back the background have the
bottom-up on that's what everything is

65
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:27,750
built on top of you have the source

66
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:31,360
and a drain those are effectively think
of them as the terminals there

67
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:35,900
the where you plug in the wires up ones
positive ones negative

68
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:40,030
what we do is we put impurities dope
it's things like phosphorous

69
00:03:40,030 --> 00:03:43,590
arsenic I other stuff

70
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:47,299
I'm just say other stuff into the
surface the way for changing the

71
00:03:47,299 --> 00:03:48,750
electoral characteristics of it

72
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:51,980
so that we can make it more or less %uh
electro

73
00:03:51,980 --> 00:03:55,170
electrically conductive electrically
resistive

74
00:03:55,170 --> 00:03:59,620
things like that are on the top we have
a gate insulator that insulates the gate

75
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:01,610
material which is where we flow the
current

76
00:04:01,610 --> 00:04:05,689
that is the on-off switch up from the
body of the transistor here

77
00:04:05,689 --> 00:04:09,549
K the last thing on top is the gates of
what happens in a transistor is

78
00:04:09,549 --> 00:04:13,200
we flow electricity through the gate the
that generates a field

79
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:16,419
that enables us to turn the transistor
on and off

80
00:04:16,418 --> 00:04:19,430
K so here's what it looks like in
practice this is a

81
00:04:19,430 --> 00:04:23,430
the I research transistor this is not
anything you ever see in manufacturing

82
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:25,490
so what you're seeing here electoral
test ads

83
00:04:25,490 --> 00:04:29,169
so that anyone who wants can connect to
the transistor

84
00:04:29,169 --> 00:04:32,520
I'm so that kicks down into contact with
her where they actually

85
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:35,849
access things a source drain a gay

86
00:04:35,850 --> 00:04:40,900
so if we at power to this with
intellectual bias cross these two

87
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:44,150
adding power here connects these two
alright

88
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:47,900
so here's how it looks in the

89
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:51,550
I guess Microsoft art I as we apply

90
00:04:51,550 --> 00:04:56,199
a possible tage we begin to formally
pinged channel

91
00:04:56,199 --> 00:05:00,050
on thats electricity beginning for
across the transistor

92
00:05:00,050 --> 00:05:03,560
as it we continue to turn it more and
more on and

93
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:07,500
on and off become relative which is fine
I'll

94
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:11,990
this is what happens we actually begin
to forcefully for me on transistor

95
00:05:11,990 --> 00:05:15,280
on the parlance that is used in the
industry

96
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:18,940
is I'll electrons and holes

97
00:05:18,940 --> 00:05:24,150
cell electrons go this way electron
holes or the absence electrons go that

98
00:05:24,150 --> 00:05:24,669
way

99
00:05:24,669 --> 00:05:27,789
we don't talk about I you when you if
you think back to high school chemistry

100
00:05:27,789 --> 00:05:28,500
humor

101
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:31,740
valence electrons on

102
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:35,600
lot of materials have either one or two
elements in their outer valence

103
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:39,289
a lot of materials have one or two holes
now turbulence we deal in

104
00:05:39,289 --> 00:05:43,039
trading electrons for holes as they move
the process how we create

105
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:47,770
kind of flow sup I first thing that's
going to break your mind

106
00:05:47,770 --> 00:05:51,258
transistors are not ditch

107
00:05:51,259 --> 00:05:54,960
so we we make digital logic circuits out
of them but they're not digital

108
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:58,669
this is what arm the electronic response
curve other transistor

109
00:05:58,669 --> 00:06:02,560
looks like so on the top on on the
y-axis here you have

110
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:06,780
on effectively current that is flowing
across the transistor

111
00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:10,310
and on the bottom you have how much
voltage were applying to the

112
00:06:10,310 --> 00:06:13,949
there are four things you should key
backer

113
00:06:13,949 --> 00:06:17,180
this is of if you notice I we're looking
at

114
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:21,850
this is a large scale so wonder the
negative second on time today a second

115
00:06:21,850 --> 00:06:25,419
that's not zero up on

116
00:06:25,419 --> 00:06:29,270
is kinda nebula state where it's mostly
on

117
00:06:29,270 --> 00:06:32,530
so we start to talk about things in
terms of the threshold

118
00:06:32,530 --> 00:06:36,310
the threshold voltage is where we get
that shoulder where things start to turn

119
00:06:36,310 --> 00:06:39,940
on where things start to behave like
their on and not of

120
00:06:39,940 --> 00:06:45,840
and everybody talks about power and heat
in transistors and computer chip usage

121
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:50,410
this is affectively the majority of what
they're talking about

122
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:53,699
they're talking about the change the
fact that our of state is not as of

123
00:06:53,699 --> 00:06:57,410
as it could be which is a term the kinda

124
00:06:57,410 --> 00:07:01,470
master be for a while and I started in
this industry of being offered

125
00:07:01,470 --> 00:07:05,250
is very very important sup basis of
construction

126
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:08,740
arm we're talk to some other tools on
the technology they're using to

127
00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:09,979
manufacture these

128
00:07:09,979 --> 00:07:13,508
that we're gonna get into what the
transistor actually look like Alex up

129
00:07:13,509 --> 00:07:18,069
personal a fat reno's Elise what a fab
you guys probably think I've

130
00:07:18,069 --> 00:07:21,750
love them a bunny suits Intel
commercials lotsa stuff

131
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:25,210
this is what a fat actually looks like
it's about four to five levels

132
00:07:25,210 --> 00:07:30,650
on this is a picture Samsung's brand new
spanking new fad in Austin Texas

133
00:07:30,650 --> 00:07:35,479
that nowadays in their usual spot
remover to wafers will talk about that

134
00:07:35,479 --> 00:07:40,440
next slide but their usually modern fab
sir about 300

135
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:44,219
thousand square feet manufacturing space

136
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:47,470
so that's large

137
00:07:47,470 --> 00:07:50,819
now consider there was a class one thing
class run

138
00:07:50,819 --> 00:07:54,680
one clean room means there's one half
micron

139
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:59,919
particle one per cubic foot I didn't mix
units stake you can talk to

140
00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:04,359
I saw arm sold as a reference

141
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:09,080
ever use really operating rooms
operating rooms are class 10,000

142
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:14,318
so so if you want to have surgery this
is probably a better place

143
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:18,879
so I wafers wafers are cool on these are
what we manufacture on

144
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:22,919
their poll they are actually a single
crystal on everything back to

145
00:08:22,919 --> 00:08:26,299
crystals in science in chemistry if I
were to take

146
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:29,900
on this this is an Indian they grow them
like this in a furnace like this

147
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:35,029
using something called the X cross key I
can actually pronounce this word process

148
00:08:35,029 --> 00:08:38,130
it onto its on wiki look it up on the
making its

149
00:08:38,130 --> 00:08:41,080
we making kits that are literally a
single crystal and then we slice them

150
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:42,479
into individual wafers

151
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:46,029
that India if I could look at it on a
molecular slate scale

152
00:08:46,029 --> 00:08:50,630
arm from me atomic stamp I could take it
I could turn on and

153
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:54,250
cut off the front cut off the back and
look

154
00:08:54,250 --> 00:08:58,290
if you're a whole between all the atoms
from the front to the back

155
00:08:58,290 --> 00:09:01,290
they all lie to perfectly arm

156
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:04,969
thats very important because the only
way they can make the process work

157
00:09:04,970 --> 00:09:09,060
contamination levels about .1
parts-per-billion

158
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:12,279
is the is the acceptable higher went

159
00:09:12,279 --> 00:09:15,800
2000 was 2011 earthquake in Japan

160
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:19,779
cut worldwide wafer production by 25
percent

161
00:09:19,779 --> 00:09:23,269
scared the heck out of everyone on
reason is

162
00:09:23,269 --> 00:09:27,459
that see big furnace that melts silicon
when the power goes off to it

163
00:09:27,459 --> 00:09:30,880
what happens it'll crystallizes it's now
shock

164
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:34,870
it has to be replaced restart takes
about a month

165
00:09:34,870 --> 00:09:38,459
up solely for sites everybody's probably
making

166
00:09:38,459 --> 00:09:41,529
so we make these in circles yeah we make
my circles and

167
00:09:41,529 --> 00:09:44,959
this is like 1955 one inch wafers so

168
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:48,300
dime nickel sized right I nowadays

169
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:53,080
everybody who's anybody uses 12-inch
wafers about the size of a dinner plate

170
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:56,950
on we're doing twenty to Nana meter
feature size on something the size of a

171
00:09:56,950 --> 00:09:57,959
dinner plate

172
00:09:57,959 --> 00:10:00,990
with is darn close to 100 sack uses we
could

173
00:10:00,990 --> 00:10:04,290
there's a initiative called the global
450 initiative

174
00:10:04,290 --> 00:10:08,920
up in Albany they're making four hundred
and fifty millimeter wave technology

175
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:12,319
work so this is a 12-inch wafer

176
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:15,490
Tom I'm also a 12-inch wafers put your
palms together

177
00:10:15,490 --> 00:10:19,339
this is the diameter up outside your
office is about six inches

178
00:10:19,339 --> 00:10:22,899
those are 18 inches arm thats very

179
00:10:22,899 --> 00:10:26,500
very very large

180
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:29,579
K folks front opening unified pots

181
00:10:29,579 --> 00:10:32,670
I talk about clean rooms I am modern

182
00:10:32,670 --> 00:10:36,089
fab you don't touch waivers you don't
handle wafers on

183
00:10:36,089 --> 00:10:39,940
even with two pairs lots on the SOL from
the Swat on your skin

184
00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:43,010
will contaminate them they're trashed
folks

185
00:10:43,010 --> 00:10:46,760
art lesson front opening if i Pods
that's where we put the silicon

186
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:50,930
wafers when we manufacture them they are
totally handled automatically

187
00:10:50,930 --> 00:10:54,820
I robotics they are held at subclass one

188
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:58,089
are cleaner mark last one thing is no
water clean enough

189
00:10:58,089 --> 00:11:01,140
to make these things work if you're back
to the first light

190
00:11:01,140 --> 00:11:04,910
human hair obverse is what the die sizes
you can see why that

191
00:11:04,910 --> 00:11:08,939
kinda happens it prevents contamination
they also kala ko them

192
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:12,060
to prevent contamination i guess i

193
00:11:12,060 --> 00:11:15,970
enter contamination between waivers at
different stages a manufacturing

194
00:11:15,970 --> 00:11:19,120
sup a tool this is the photography

195
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:22,800
photography is two largest at the core
technology

196
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:26,480
I love semiconductor manufacturing sick
or because for years and years and years

197
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:27,579
and years and years

198
00:11:27,579 --> 00:11:31,050
its usually been the technological
limiter in terms of making

199
00:11:31,050 --> 00:11:34,470
things small I know I'm anybody is your
nose on

200
00:11:34,470 --> 00:11:37,490
knows this field I'm prolly stretching
it a little bit but

201
00:11:37,490 --> 00:11:41,940
lithography is important photography is
photography on E

202
00:11:41,940 --> 00:11:45,990
very weird scale on so what happens is
we caught the way for

203
00:11:45,990 --> 00:11:49,360
in a thing called voters steady photo
reactive chemical

204
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:53,430
I we then have be pattern radical a mask

205
00:11:53,430 --> 00:11:56,430
is interchangeable terms for and shiny
very very

206
00:11:56,430 --> 00:12:00,190
right light through it and printed on
the way for

207
00:12:00,190 --> 00:12:03,410
on these two pieces of equipment
vaulting doing modern the fuck

208
00:12:03,410 --> 00:12:07,260
track here this peace agreement only
handles the photoresist

209
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:11,839
it coats the way for you're talking they
measure the sicknesses and and strums

210
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:15,649
names 10 have an animator I

211
00:12:15,649 --> 00:12:19,500
and eight develop it date printed they
bake it so that we have

212
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:23,410
which replicate that pattern the other
piece is this year's hottest efforts the

213
00:12:23,410 --> 00:12:24,260
scanner

214
00:12:24,260 --> 00:12:27,510
that's the piece of equipment that
actually manufactures actually

215
00:12:27,510 --> 00:12:31,160
Prince that pattern onto the surface up
the way for

216
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:36,209
I this year modern one $35 million
dollars

217
00:12:36,209 --> 00:12:40,670
up that's not such a big deal some a
connector factories

218
00:12:40,670 --> 00:12:43,870
eighty monthly time that's a big deal
some manufactures

219
00:12:43,870 --> 00:12:46,889
especially because on the lens set on
these

220
00:12:46,889 --> 00:12:50,570
you if you think about your printing the
same pattern hundreds if not thousands

221
00:12:50,570 --> 00:12:52,440
of times a day

222
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:58,410
I everything so i cant think that a
camera lens key where out a camera lens

223
00:12:58,410 --> 00:13:02,100
when we're talking about this level love
precision

224
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:05,790
you can start to wear out the lense on
your shooting photons

225
00:13:05,790 --> 00:13:08,889
the exact same spot on the lens over and
over and over again

226
00:13:08,889 --> 00:13:12,950
you where the lenses out on from put on
a corrosion

227
00:13:12,950 --> 00:13:16,470
suck and it's not that they don't work
it's that

228
00:13:16,470 --> 00:13:20,399
the art accurate enough anymore army
takes a couple years

229
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:23,500
you're starting to see it though people
these eight-inch still om

230
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:26,930
look staffers are wearing out from
Lindsay's arm

231
00:13:26,930 --> 00:13:30,200
modern technology uses 193 enemy light

232
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:33,910
I'm if you've been paying attention you
know we're not making transistors 193

233
00:13:33,910 --> 00:13:34,670
animators

234
00:13:34,670 --> 00:13:37,740
so we're making things smaller than the
wavelength of light were using to print

235
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:38,639
features

236
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:42,610
sup that makes life hard that makes
lithography weird

237
00:13:42,610 --> 00:13:46,880
we get cool stuff arm lockerbie
technique improvement what

238
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:50,380
optical proximity correction so if I
want to print

239
00:13:50,380 --> 00:13:53,639
this l-shaped on a wafer you think might
put that

240
00:13:53,639 --> 00:13:56,880
l-shape on a mask if I do that

241
00:13:56,880 --> 00:14:01,350
I get that she that doesn't work in some
areas it's bigger it doesn't like

242
00:14:01,350 --> 00:14:04,060
internal corners doesn't like external
corners

243
00:14:04,060 --> 00:14:07,589
this shape Sox

244
00:14:07,589 --> 00:14:11,610
so strike at what if I printed that she

245
00:14:11,610 --> 00:14:14,730
that shape on is numerically determined

246
00:14:14,730 --> 00:14:18,620
basically %uh calculated in a
supercomputer

247
00:14:18,620 --> 00:14:23,120
on they do it on ever almost every
single layer every single mass

248
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:28,769
every single device it prints a shape
that looks like

249
00:14:28,769 --> 00:14:32,670
so overlay here %uh the cut and is the
old shape

250
00:14:32,670 --> 00:14:36,990
the graze the sheep that helps us
immensely

251
00:14:36,990 --> 00:14:40,029
I because still were using light its
bigger

252
00:14:40,029 --> 00:14:43,350
then the devices so next step

253
00:14:43,350 --> 00:14:48,060
I anti-reflective coatings I'll the top
sold these are large features

254
00:14:48,060 --> 00:14:52,160
used to you demonstrate this technique
on the left this is without the coating

255
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:53,699
which are seen you see that pattern

256
00:14:53,699 --> 00:14:56,779
the kinda the repeating pattern the wall

257
00:14:56,779 --> 00:15:03,329
that's the photon possibly

258
00:15:03,329 --> 00:15:06,910
yeah so without the coding um

259
00:15:06,910 --> 00:15:10,500
it bounces back in a totally different
might bounce back

260
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:13,940
it does its own thing if we put coating
called anti-reflective

261
00:15:13,940 --> 00:15:17,589
it is lots a different terms this one's
copyrighted I'm using anyways

262
00:15:17,589 --> 00:15:20,680
difficult coating on the bottom we
control the reflection

263
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:24,000
we make we play with constructive
destructive interference

264
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:28,329
we make that that's an improvement so
this is a big feature the top on two big

265
00:15:28,329 --> 00:15:29,070
feature

266
00:15:29,070 --> 00:15:32,320
I you can see the pattern this I could
still make it to myself

267
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:35,850
let's go to the bottom bottom is when
you make it to a normal

268
00:15:35,850 --> 00:15:39,519
by sight this is without that looks like
crap

269
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:43,060
this is with that looks like railroad
tracks right

270
00:15:43,060 --> 00:15:46,959
so this is huge enabling technology um

271
00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:50,399
the next enabling technology on the talk
about to get the same time is

272
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:53,630
I a quick advances what you're seeing
here is

273
00:15:53,630 --> 00:15:57,310
have a a couple of pictures about
immersion lithography

274
00:15:57,310 --> 00:16:00,910
you just heard a commercial harbury's
it's the big thing intel's doing this

275
00:16:00,910 --> 00:16:01,810
now wow

276
00:16:01,810 --> 00:16:05,250
arm basically we're taking advantage

277
00:16:05,250 --> 00:16:08,329
%uh the affect you get when you tryin

278
00:16:08,329 --> 00:16:11,440
bro rocket something apart it misses

279
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:15,320
you get refraction water has a very
different index refraction

280
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:19,720
than air I this is our land see you can
follow the individual beams a light

281
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:22,810
with air the they're all spread out with
water

282
00:16:22,810 --> 00:16:26,380
we compete we can use water clear water
between the lens and the way for

283
00:16:26,380 --> 00:16:29,570
piece them together day art

284
00:16:29,570 --> 00:16:32,990
better quality control and using that
same 193 and you're like

285
00:16:32,990 --> 00:16:36,519
we can theoretically physically make
smaller features

286
00:16:36,519 --> 00:16:39,639
arm getting this to work took

287
00:16:39,639 --> 00:16:42,870
the decade they've been working on this
for years odd dues

288
00:16:42,870 --> 00:16:46,220
two different kind of theories on how to
do it one of them is def the entire way

289
00:16:46,220 --> 00:16:47,399
for in water

290
00:16:47,399 --> 00:16:50,430
that's really problematic because you
have to move the way for around

291
00:16:50,430 --> 00:16:53,620
are means you're getting a lot ripples
in the water the water moves around

292
00:16:53,620 --> 00:16:55,380
enlargement around

293
00:16:55,380 --> 00:16:58,939
you can't print straight through it so
instead

294
00:16:58,940 --> 00:17:02,370
the kinda generally adopted solution om
is

295
00:17:02,370 --> 00:17:06,130
recovered water its in a lot of ways
worse

296
00:17:06,130 --> 00:17:09,500
but it works they don't get the whole
way for what they do is they have the

297
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:10,480
feed side

298
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:13,530
look what they call it would supply and
liquid recovery

299
00:17:13,530 --> 00:17:17,049
and establish a pee bottle of water
between the lens

300
00:17:17,049 --> 00:17:20,699
and the way for on the stage which moves
it from

301
00:17:20,699 --> 00:17:25,280
chip to chip are continuously the water
par that major delay was

302
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:29,289
producing water clean enough to do this
by the

303
00:17:29,289 --> 00:17:32,660
do it now its incredible arm

304
00:17:32,660 --> 00:17:35,760
I'm blown away that they actually got
this to work

305
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:39,020
self the other one that you can start
hearing about in a couple years

306
00:17:39,020 --> 00:17:43,500
actually there's a press release this
week Intel just invested a billion

307
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:44,490
dollars

308
00:17:44,490 --> 00:17:47,530
in making this technology work this is

309
00:17:47,530 --> 00:17:51,129
S and L's other company company that
makes these things the UV

310
00:17:51,130 --> 00:17:54,140
UV means extreme UV

311
00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:57,240
we're pushing the wavelength of light
that we're using

312
00:17:57,240 --> 00:18:00,669
to print these down down down the
smaller the wavelength of light

313
00:18:00,669 --> 00:18:03,500
the better we can make these features
for all the other reasons we talked

314
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:03,799
about

315
00:18:03,799 --> 00:18:07,470
on the problem EV is what I'm extremely
light debt

316
00:18:07,470 --> 00:18:11,809
you can't do it in an air environment
which means you can't use merge

317
00:18:11,809 --> 00:18:15,020
of because all the water evaporates UV

318
00:18:15,020 --> 00:18:19,168
is so week as a light source that you
have to do it in a vacuum

319
00:18:19,169 --> 00:18:22,960
or the wavelength the wave property so
this is

320
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:26,559
up in albany I am they've been releasing
some pictures this is the

321
00:18:26,559 --> 00:18:31,059
currently as far as I know only the UV
development tool

322
00:18:31,059 --> 00:18:34,830
on this is just the stepper this is the
part that does the printing not the

323
00:18:34,830 --> 00:18:35,320
coating

324
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:38,649
that's a human being this is the tool

325
00:18:38,650 --> 00:18:42,150
there's one of these right now arm so
this is what you're gonna see in 10 or

326
00:18:42,150 --> 00:18:43,000
15

327
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:47,280
are up hopefully five years not
reachable

328
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:52,799
are ion implantation site talked about
gates and sources and drains

329
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:56,070
this the sources in the drains are

330
00:18:56,070 --> 00:19:00,059
what we used to kinda generate each in
sister that behaves the way

331
00:19:00,059 --> 00:19:03,240
one om to do that we insert opens %uh

332
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:06,740
lots of different materials into the
service the waiver

333
00:19:06,740 --> 00:19:10,299
the the used to do it when they called
spin on class

334
00:19:10,299 --> 00:19:14,620
and the diffusion a fact it's been a
contaminant on top overlayer

335
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:18,289
lithography and then you debate the way
for and using the properties at Fusion

336
00:19:18,289 --> 00:19:21,950
the way for would suck it in nowadays
the use

337
00:19:21,950 --> 00:19:24,960
ion implantation I and implantation is

338
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:28,169
the LHC struck size down

339
00:19:28,169 --> 00:19:31,309
it is literally a particle sorry take
the gas that you what

340
00:19:31,309 --> 00:19:34,770
you put it in here you

341
00:19:34,770 --> 00:19:37,789
run it through particle accelerator and
you shoot it

342
00:19:37,789 --> 00:19:41,289
embedded Adam by Adam in the surface of
the wafer

343
00:19:41,289 --> 00:19:44,510
on materials for this include

344
00:19:44,510 --> 00:19:48,160
gas if I'd arsenic I'll

345
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:52,309
xylene which was initially as a that
that story is told me as eileen was

346
00:19:52,309 --> 00:19:54,750
developed as a nerve gas now use
semiconductors

347
00:19:54,750 --> 00:19:58,240
up the wafers about 400 degrees C

348
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:03,049
and these things use permanent magnets
there are very large and run about 400

349
00:20:03,049 --> 00:20:03,490
amps

350
00:20:03,490 --> 00:20:06,780
lot the people who work on the answer

351
00:20:06,780 --> 00:20:11,789
weird the people in the fab who

352
00:20:11,789 --> 00:20:15,210
don't work on these stay far away

353
00:20:15,210 --> 00:20:19,090
are dude is the constant story of a
rumor that is not supported by any

354
00:20:19,090 --> 00:20:20,629
statistical fact that

355
00:20:20,630 --> 00:20:24,179
the people who work in these only have
girls on the disproven that nobody

356
00:20:24,179 --> 00:20:24,610
believes

357
00:20:24,610 --> 00:20:28,380
so chemical vapor deposition

358
00:20:28,380 --> 00:20:32,549
I wanna put a layer on the surface of a
way for its very controlled how do I do

359
00:20:32,549 --> 00:20:33,010
it

360
00:20:33,010 --> 00:20:36,840
on chemical vapor deposition that he is
one of the three ways to do it

361
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:40,760
visible vapors that deposition is
another thats starting to go away

362
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:41,580
because it's

363
00:20:41,580 --> 00:20:46,510
imprecise I'm imprecise is a relative
term so chemical vapor deposition I have

364
00:20:46,510 --> 00:20:50,129
usually in argon curtain are gone
isolation gasser

365
00:20:50,130 --> 00:20:53,159
something inner week you could hear the
UC on

366
00:20:53,159 --> 00:20:56,919
me on it doesn't matter anything from
the far right into the periodic table

367
00:20:56,919 --> 00:21:00,549
then we start flowing other gases oMG
might flow

368
00:21:00,549 --> 00:21:03,929
I you know what say that home

369
00:21:03,929 --> 00:21:07,690
you float to compounded gases that form
a chemical reaction

370
00:21:07,690 --> 00:21:11,200
usually it's a service on the reactions
were doing a chemical reaction on the

371
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:12,250
surface of the wafer

372
00:21:12,250 --> 00:21:15,330
that literally causes the layer of what
you want

373
00:21:15,330 --> 00:21:18,879
to organically grow usually to
temperature you can control

374
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:22,340
on growth rate temperature or you can
control

375
00:21:22,340 --> 00:21:26,049
your for me for temperature uniformity I
didn't mention uniform we talk about

376
00:21:26,049 --> 00:21:28,450
building a dream only way

377
00:21:28,450 --> 00:21:31,480
we can control thickness better

378
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:35,610
in a lot of ways to me but you have to
control uniformity

379
00:21:35,610 --> 00:21:39,950
if you talk about something that's will
say 5 nanometers thick

380
00:21:39,950 --> 00:21:44,010
a layer that's five meters thick if it's
five millimeters thick

381
00:21:44,010 --> 00:21:47,720
everywhere on the way for you're happy
camper the transistor or behave the same

382
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:51,230
everywhere if it's five at one point for
another

383
00:21:51,230 --> 00:21:55,210
38 another 6 another you have

384
00:21:55,210 --> 00:21:58,220
infinite number very differ transistors
so

385
00:21:58,220 --> 00:22:01,919
uniform is a big deal chemical vapor
deposition is very good

386
00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:05,330
at uniformity something that's better
uniformity

387
00:22:05,330 --> 00:22:10,000
is called atomic layer deposition on
this is what

388
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:13,260
I think most companies are starting to
use now for any

389
00:22:13,260 --> 00:22:16,440
%ah fitness and uniformity critical
layers

390
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:21,429
it's basically not dissimilar to the
concept of a pox it's two parts

391
00:22:21,429 --> 00:22:24,510
you flow one part one

392
00:22:24,510 --> 00:22:28,350
pre reacted over the surface the way for
then you

393
00:22:28,350 --> 00:22:32,500
evacuate use a vacuum pump on then you
flow the second

394
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:36,900
they react you pump out the byproducts
and you're left with

395
00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:40,260
one layer I love Adams form a lot

396
00:22:40,260 --> 00:22:44,850
molecules on the surface the way for
it's incredibly conformal

397
00:22:44,850 --> 00:22:49,220
conformal is huge because you start to
get things that are very tall in very

398
00:22:49,220 --> 00:22:49,730
narrow

399
00:22:49,730 --> 00:22:52,890
what you're looking at here's how to
test structures is to two hundred and

400
00:22:52,890 --> 00:22:54,230
beers right here

401
00:22:54,230 --> 00:22:57,299
let's think about that we have the exact
same thickness

402
00:22:57,299 --> 00:23:01,840
up until it pinches all the way around
chemical vapor key deposition

403
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:06,059
you can't do that physical vapor
deposition really struggles with it so

404
00:23:06,059 --> 00:23:07,480
you will resume in here

405
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:11,080
you can see layer by layer by layer by
layer

406
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:16,939
its really bombers developed in the
nineteen sixties in Russia

407
00:23:16,940 --> 00:23:20,570
I in about 99

408
00:23:20,570 --> 00:23:24,110
there so they finally started to figure
out how to use it and it started to

409
00:23:24,110 --> 00:23:25,400
really come into play I

410
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:29,120
its I'm Ste gonna say around 2,000

411
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:32,860
5 2008 somewhere in that in that range

412
00:23:32,860 --> 00:23:36,539
on the benefits are twofold like I said
the first is conform Allen the

413
00:23:36,539 --> 00:23:40,090
pic it's the same thickness throughout
the entire length layer

414
00:23:40,090 --> 00:23:43,209
on the other one is when we're doing at
layer by layer

415
00:23:43,210 --> 00:23:46,700
sickness control becomes really easy
because we just

416
00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:51,900
matters track players we don't have to
worry about timing nearly as much

417
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:55,270
you can do a lot of different materials
with this unfortunately

418
00:23:55,270 --> 00:23:58,429
here do you have to engineer the
reactions

419
00:23:58,429 --> 00:24:02,220
om from the precursors and so it gets a
little complicated

420
00:24:02,220 --> 00:24:06,559
by you part because you can't do things
like silicon nitride silicon nitride

421
00:24:06,559 --> 00:24:10,389
is a very common material to use on ash
top

422
00:24:10,390 --> 00:24:13,770
mom in semiconductors using that stopped
to control the shape

423
00:24:13,770 --> 00:24:17,840
DEP the profile things at you moving
from the way for

424
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:22,049
and so it the college top silicon
nitride you can't do I

425
00:24:22,049 --> 00:24:25,250
as far as I know can't deposit silicon
dioxide

426
00:24:25,250 --> 00:24:28,960
either with alte atomic layer deposition

427
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:33,029
which up up until very recently silicon
dioxide is being kinda the

428
00:24:33,029 --> 00:24:36,919
the standard dialect recurrence live
material for chips

429
00:24:36,919 --> 00:24:40,090
account I'm okay sewn up science and

430
00:24:40,090 --> 00:24:43,939
me talking I mention hoops let's watch a
video

431
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:49,570
see how this works

432
00:24:49,570 --> 00:24:52,889
so I kinda mentioned group

433
00:24:52,890 --> 00:24:55,919
this is afoot foo 25 wafers

434
00:24:55,919 --> 00:25:00,610
I'd say you're talking sixty thousand
dollars in revenue from a

435
00:25:00,610 --> 00:25:04,340
up leading edge way for on terms revenue
in

436
00:25:04,340 --> 00:25:07,439
chips and RAM memory 25

437
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:10,630
wafers in a full 60 grand makes

438
00:25:10,630 --> 00:25:17,080
now 1.5 million dollars this is a bad
day

439
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:20,090
I concept one

440
00:25:20,090 --> 00:25:25,139
don't do that concept to from anyone
who's working a technical field the

441
00:25:25,140 --> 00:25:27,650
radius a plane

442
00:25:27,650 --> 00:25:32,230
I the

443
00:25:32,230 --> 00:25:39,230
I the

444
00:25:40,550 --> 00:25:41,990
if you notice the time clock

445
00:25:41,990 --> 00:25:45,700
a basic EPS in time but they're it's
five thirty in the morning

446
00:25:45,700 --> 00:25:50,020
so what happened here

447
00:25:50,020 --> 00:25:53,670
um and engineers day just got very bad

448
00:25:53,670 --> 00:25:57,240
are if he's not up already the engineer
got woken up now

449
00:25:57,240 --> 00:26:02,740
I the

450
00:26:02,740 --> 00:26:05,370
I'm not kidding and huh

451
00:26:05,370 --> 00:26:08,700
oh yeah no cameras

452
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:12,100
on at least one other places I work we
had phones

453
00:26:12,100 --> 00:26:15,630
they want to be like in touch you 24/7
when I got my phone

454
00:26:15,630 --> 00:26:19,429
it was a blackberry had a hole drilled
in the back where there used to be a

455
00:26:19,429 --> 00:26:19,880
camera

456
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:24,130
it was yet its

457
00:26:24,130 --> 00:26:27,610
you prolly VoIP on they're trying to
move away from using radios which they

458
00:26:27,610 --> 00:26:28,210
used to use

459
00:26:28,210 --> 00:26:33,409
radios will screw up the tools EM for
radio will

460
00:26:33,409 --> 00:26:36,620
shift all your parametric ce it may even
shut down the tool

461
00:26:36,620 --> 00:26:39,870
so what happened there we mention fukes

462
00:26:39,870 --> 00:26:44,710
and wafer handling and subclass one the
tool

463
00:26:44,710 --> 00:26:48,230
has a robot arm that does all the way
from its the robot missed

464
00:26:48,230 --> 00:26:52,840
um the reason there's a video cam their
video cameras are not comment in fact

465
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:53,320
they

466
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:56,590
they just arm most likely those weren't
really

467
00:26:56,590 --> 00:27:00,270
those were cast wafers what they call
cycling wafers they're trying to figure

468
00:27:00,270 --> 00:27:03,289
out what the handling problem with was
the with the toll was

469
00:27:03,289 --> 00:27:07,029
they found um the robot

470
00:27:07,029 --> 00:27:11,210
most likely had a a misalignment and
when I tried to put the way for it holds

471
00:27:11,210 --> 00:27:12,350
the way for you vacuum

472
00:27:12,350 --> 00:27:16,230
hit the Foo rather than com

473
00:27:16,230 --> 00:27:19,690
is uniquely normally the poops a lot to
the table

474
00:27:19,690 --> 00:27:23,110
if it unlocked to the tool om it would
have been worse

475
00:27:23,110 --> 00:27:26,730
because the two the way for with a
broken inside the tool

476
00:27:26,730 --> 00:27:31,770
and making it clean again may not ever
happen

477
00:27:31,770 --> 00:27:36,120
it's back so what they did there wasn't
a lot

478
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:40,010
through so that if that happened it'll
they thought it would probably mover

479
00:27:40,010 --> 00:27:41,220
shifter catch the way for

480
00:27:41,220 --> 00:27:44,840
I out the plan that for the win running
sup

481
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:47,929
so that's cuff alright so

482
00:27:47,929 --> 00:27:52,570
the steps here's what in modern
transistor kinda looks like so

483
00:27:52,570 --> 00:27:56,750
first thing is we have are substrate we
have such a hearing blue

484
00:27:56,750 --> 00:28:00,230
first step that always happens nowadays
is

485
00:28:00,230 --> 00:28:04,669
what's called so shallow trench looking
trench isolation the devices are so

486
00:28:04,669 --> 00:28:06,110
small so close together

487
00:28:06,110 --> 00:28:11,500
I'm so kinda not behaving like we want
them to we can just keep

488
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:14,940
control over them that they start have
started to things where they basically

489
00:28:14,940 --> 00:28:15,500
insert

490
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:18,770
insulator between each device I speak
French crosstalk

491
00:28:18,770 --> 00:28:22,279
it prevents leakage prevents one
transistor for turning on another

492
00:28:22,279 --> 00:28:22,889
transistor

493
00:28:22,889 --> 00:28:26,289
so that's the first thing that happened
second thing that happens we put down

494
00:28:26,289 --> 00:28:28,500
our gate insulator here's a part that we
know

495
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:31,820
we had six parts we're gonna turn it
into a lot more parts

496
00:28:31,820 --> 00:28:34,970
object the gate insulator

497
00:28:34,970 --> 00:28:39,360
goes down and it does two things one it
is our gate insulator it

498
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:43,240
isolates the gate at the transistor from
the body the transistor so we can

499
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:46,610
make it working not have a short to when
we

500
00:28:46,610 --> 00:28:49,940
openness of itself Alliance for us

501
00:28:49,940 --> 00:28:53,510
all the steps we're going to do after
insulators highly critical

502
00:28:53,510 --> 00:28:57,440
and because that they want everything
everything is to align with it

503
00:28:57,440 --> 00:29:00,990
so they do this step first the deposit
Rd

504
00:29:00,990 --> 00:29:04,700
get material for years and years and
years think of polysilicon sir

505
00:29:04,700 --> 00:29:08,730
hold the question thanks I'm

506
00:29:08,730 --> 00:29:13,679
I'm is a lot in here arm it's in poly
silicon which is a

507
00:29:13,679 --> 00:29:16,700
different crystalline version is seldom
use a substrate

508
00:29:16,700 --> 00:29:19,799
its more electrically conductive its
tall

509
00:29:19,799 --> 00:29:22,850
I'm so it can stand up to all the future
processing

510
00:29:22,850 --> 00:29:26,409
that's what they've been using their
going away from that now top

511
00:29:26,409 --> 00:29:30,149
pas our source in our dreams dope are
sore surgery

512
00:29:30,149 --> 00:29:33,520
so we begin to form with and I am
planner the

513
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:36,389
regions that we won to connect the
transistor do that we want to be a

514
00:29:36,389 --> 00:29:36,940
transistor

515
00:29:36,940 --> 00:29:40,909
then we form a small spacer spacer does
a bunch of things

516
00:29:40,909 --> 00:29:44,970
it's not electrically really part of the
transistor but it's absolutely necessary

517
00:29:44,970 --> 00:29:45,970
modern

518
00:29:45,970 --> 00:29:50,059
transistors because it contains the gate
it also narrows these openings

519
00:29:50,059 --> 00:29:54,000
which becomes really important when we
do was quite deep source injury

520
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:58,740
the initial opens here very very light
that we do a heavier doping

521
00:29:58,740 --> 00:30:02,590
on this allows us to begin Tran having
the single region

522
00:30:02,590 --> 00:30:06,200
for the source in a single region for
the drain I you're getting very much

523
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:07,990
towards custom profile its

524
00:30:07,990 --> 00:30:11,880
curve rather it analog versus digital
sources dream

525
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:15,049
disagree with on then we far south side

526
00:30:15,049 --> 00:30:19,179
so at some point we have to connect
these transistors to the outside world

527
00:30:19,179 --> 00:30:22,429
if you think about a city the transistor
is your house

528
00:30:22,429 --> 00:30:26,309
everything that goes above it allows the
transistor to talk to the outside world

529
00:30:26,309 --> 00:30:29,418
is the streets the highways gets
progressively big

530
00:30:29,419 --> 00:30:32,929
Saleh side what they do is effectively
they're kinda makes a museum

531
00:30:32,929 --> 00:30:37,899
metal and silicon the former

532
00:30:37,899 --> 00:30:41,190
a I guess ur helluva

533
00:30:41,190 --> 00:30:44,860
gap coverage so that we can actually get
them to talk

534
00:30:44,860 --> 00:30:49,090
we do on top each the source the train
and on top of the key

535
00:30:49,090 --> 00:30:52,990
then we drive the Dolphins so we talked
about the two

536
00:30:52,990 --> 00:30:56,510
two different these are really like
fourteen different

537
00:30:56,510 --> 00:31:00,350
implants to get this the way we want
then we set we heated up a very high

538
00:31:00,350 --> 00:31:02,070
temperature

539
00:31:02,070 --> 00:31:05,700
over 1000 BCE for less than a second

540
00:31:05,700 --> 00:31:09,129
and diffusion diffusion happens and

541
00:31:09,129 --> 00:31:12,490
everything moves around and we end up
with very much a profile in here

542
00:31:12,490 --> 00:31:16,190
that can channel the locations in the
densities of electrons

543
00:31:16,190 --> 00:31:20,419
and holes very much exactly where we
want them so we control things like

544
00:31:20,419 --> 00:31:23,440
the leakage the threshold voltage things
like that

545
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:26,889
that would posit I lectured at this
point were done making what we'll call

546
00:31:26,889 --> 00:31:30,700
device down here now we begin the
connected to the outside world

547
00:31:30,700 --> 00:31:34,100
so for some it was we see all the whole
thing that happen so that they

548
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:38,370
Cantley we don't want om electricity
getting from one to another

549
00:31:38,370 --> 00:31:41,570
and we want to build isolate up edge

550
00:31:41,570 --> 00:31:45,510
trenches and contacts this is the first
step in

551
00:31:45,510 --> 00:31:48,960
having something they can talk to we
deposit

552
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:53,610
a medal in there we still have a week
off till contacts in trenches

553
00:31:53,610 --> 00:31:57,240
we have twice that we back in processing

554
00:31:57,240 --> 00:32:00,860
so this point we have your house we have
your driveway

555
00:32:00,860 --> 00:32:04,490
um then we start building with a metal
layers switch in the back and crossing

556
00:32:04,490 --> 00:32:04,909
that

557
00:32:04,909 --> 00:32:08,450
I get to really hear but which is what
interconnects

558
00:32:08,450 --> 00:32:12,279
individual transistors individual places
in a logic circuit in the logic circuits

559
00:32:12,279 --> 00:32:13,110
into

560
00:32:13,110 --> 00:32:17,200
memory Kors into everything you need to
make

561
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:20,919
a computer chip out quantities on I
talked about these is like

562
00:32:20,919 --> 00:32:25,120
what 10 or 11 steps here these are steps

563
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:28,600
these are what we would call in fab
parlance segments

564
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:31,799
on like this

565
00:32:31,799 --> 00:32:35,690
14 15 steps if not more this whole set

566
00:32:35,690 --> 00:32:39,950
by the time it goes to what you call the
back end it's about three weeks later

567
00:32:39,950 --> 00:32:44,129
if you're good and somewhere in the
range I'd say five hundred steps

568
00:32:44,129 --> 00:32:47,240
that's I'm plea arrangement but 500
steps

569
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:50,620
we've done 500 different things 500
different tools to the way

570
00:32:50,620 --> 00:32:54,360
as it takes I have the backup site
through it

571
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:57,889
how you build the shallow trenches
without any trilogy

572
00:32:57,889 --> 00:33:01,169
quality control error checking mom

573
00:33:01,169 --> 00:33:04,220
inspection it's at least 13 different
steps

574
00:33:04,220 --> 00:33:07,409
just the physical actions required to
put those trenches

575
00:33:07,409 --> 00:33:10,440
Witcher probably the simplest feature on
here in place

576
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:15,049
sup that's what it looks like when we
talked about it as a theoretical device

577
00:33:15,049 --> 00:33:18,200
this is what it looks like now

578
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:21,490
here's what it looks like in a7 picture

579
00:33:21,490 --> 00:33:25,230
so you can start to actually see the
features here are those trenches

580
00:33:25,230 --> 00:33:28,929
we talked about com aspect ratio very
very called

581
00:33:28,929 --> 00:33:32,049
very very narrow you can see these are
the contacts

582
00:33:32,049 --> 00:33:35,610
that we talk at the last up the connects
to the outside world here

583
00:33:35,610 --> 00:33:39,159
that little car a white dot that's our
Saleh side

584
00:33:39,159 --> 00:33:42,210
here sources and drains

585
00:33:42,210 --> 00:33:46,740
everything in here exists policy in the
air this is like the transistor itself

586
00:33:46,740 --> 00:33:48,820
this is the things you're probably
thinking I've

587
00:33:48,820 --> 00:33:53,000
and if you look at it like this let's
zoom in a little more

588
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:58,169
kept this is a 2010 you're a sixteen
animator device

589
00:33:58,169 --> 00:34:01,370
right now om think

590
00:34:01,370 --> 00:34:06,570
Toshiba has a 14 animator

591
00:34:06,570 --> 00:34:10,500
grammar memory technology that they're
starting to manufacture so that's

592
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:15,349
what is a former 5th or 4th the size

593
00:34:15,349 --> 00:34:18,760
here is the zoom in of our source our
train

594
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:22,210
our gate our contact our south side in
our contact at

595
00:34:22,210 --> 00:34:26,659
16 and here's why this is in a lot of
fun this isn'ta whole lot

596
00:34:26,659 --> 00:34:31,050
let's zoom in more here's the key so you
see that

597
00:34:31,050 --> 00:34:34,319
that's 1.2 nanners arm

598
00:34:34,319 --> 00:34:38,020
you reached a point at this point this
is using a traditional a silicon dioxide

599
00:34:38,020 --> 00:34:39,129
insulated

600
00:34:39,129 --> 00:34:43,049
gate insulator they don't measure that
name used to measure

601
00:34:43,049 --> 00:34:47,730
sanctions when you're here you talk
about monolayers

602
00:34:47,730 --> 00:34:51,449
I guess what a model areas the layer
about us

603
00:34:51,449 --> 00:34:54,460
that's four

604
00:34:54,460 --> 00:34:58,150
how deep a tolerance on three probably
shorts out

605
00:34:58,150 --> 00:35:05,140
five probably won't connect

606
00:35:05,140 --> 00:35:08,140
it takes a minute it takes me a minute
processed

607
00:35:08,140 --> 00:35:12,310
yes I'll the link between the source in
the drain

608
00:35:12,310 --> 00:35:15,839
that channel that we talked about on
this device

609
00:35:15,839 --> 00:35:20,830
282 monolayers 182 Adams between the
source and drain

610
00:35:20,830 --> 00:35:24,520
this device i sat 2010 arm

611
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:28,049
I'm not really sure where this came from
it was a research paper

612
00:35:28,049 --> 00:35:31,290
on the coated the clock speed

613
00:35:31,290 --> 00:35:34,330
up the a V chip that this came out as

614
00:35:34,330 --> 00:35:37,369
10 gigahertz I don't know if that's
right of trial

615
00:35:37,369 --> 00:35:40,400
I don't care but they also gave

616
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:43,960
really interesting number which is the
transistors eats everything's what clock

617
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:45,030
speed you think about

618
00:35:45,030 --> 00:35:48,540
from a gigahertz is my processor so this
a

619
00:35:48,540 --> 00:35:52,119
10 gigahertz clock speed

620
00:35:52,119 --> 00:35:55,750
it's a 200 gigahertz transistors

621
00:35:55,750 --> 00:35:59,830
so that's not uncommon you're talking
these things are switching on/off

622
00:35:59,830 --> 00:36:02,950
in the picosecond range arm so that's

623
00:36:02,950 --> 00:36:06,390
to me really cool what does that look
like so here's

624
00:36:06,390 --> 00:36:10,350
zoomed it this is what it looks like in
the context up your whole check

625
00:36:10,350 --> 00:36:14,060
that little chip you have inside your
computer cut it open with the

626
00:36:14,060 --> 00:36:17,490
electron beam she this is what it looks
like here

627
00:36:17,490 --> 00:36:21,010
this is Intel 20 name is a publicly
releases don't worry

628
00:36:21,010 --> 00:36:25,520
and here is Apple's 45 net Meter process
for Samsung

629
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:29,700
that's in your iPad at the top you can
see the very large metal layers this is

630
00:36:29,700 --> 00:36:30,930
what the outside world

631
00:36:30,930 --> 00:36:33,970
next to this is what the packaging
connects to

632
00:36:33,970 --> 00:36:37,190
metal layers get apparently smaller
smaller smaller small smaller

633
00:36:37,190 --> 00:36:41,520
this is all back at all we've talked
about the green park here

634
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:44,750
yes see that down there those the device

635
00:36:44,750 --> 00:36:48,130
that's all in one package this the

636
00:36:48,130 --> 00:36:51,299
is I to estimate a 100 micron

637
00:36:51,299 --> 00:36:54,770
vertical thickness here same thing over
here you can see

638
00:36:54,770 --> 00:36:57,780
the contacts there that all narrow
things down there

639
00:36:57,780 --> 00:37:01,839
then you can start to see the individual
devices in the in the parks down there

640
00:37:01,839 --> 00:37:05,690
so that's war-making that's what all
those individual parts on the front

641
00:37:05,690 --> 00:37:08,859
I so modern improvements

642
00:37:08,859 --> 00:37:12,630
thats fairly modern where we going in

643
00:37:12,630 --> 00:37:15,690
the last four years where we going in
the future on the goals

644
00:37:15,690 --> 00:37:18,930
archive threefold really make

645
00:37:18,930 --> 00:37:21,940
of of I'll

646
00:37:21,940 --> 00:37:25,589
for additional vice to a weird but word
producing leak for making it so that

647
00:37:25,589 --> 00:37:26,640
when we tell it to be off

648
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:30,150
it's all we wanna make the difference
between on and off

649
00:37:30,150 --> 00:37:33,190
sharp we want to me as are ability to
turn things

650
00:37:33,190 --> 00:37:37,089
on and off faster means we can go faster
and we can start

651
00:37:37,089 --> 00:37:40,660
changing other features the transistor
because reality is decision

652
00:37:40,660 --> 00:37:45,220
like these are independent parts every
single point on here is related to every

653
00:37:45,220 --> 00:37:46,240
single other point

654
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:50,470
if we can make the sharper weak and
inherently return our process to make

655
00:37:50,470 --> 00:37:53,480
of of and the other thing is make

656
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:57,569
on sooner I'll if we can make on and off
sharper

657
00:37:57,569 --> 00:38:00,920
if we can make of offer we can start
making on sir

658
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:05,230
we bring it down the voltage scale means
we use less power

659
00:38:05,230 --> 00:38:08,520
and we have to ramp that both the job
even if it's a big risk even its

660
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:11,910
half a bolt we have to ramp that voltage
up

661
00:38:11,910 --> 00:38:15,319
from zero that takes time

662
00:38:15,319 --> 00:38:19,270
doesn't take long but it takes time so
freakin lower threshold voltage is a

663
00:38:19,270 --> 00:38:19,990
little bit

664
00:38:19,990 --> 00:38:24,109
wearing a faster chip were used less
energy because energies cumulative

665
00:38:24,109 --> 00:38:27,440
in all that are we take ramping up TT
cell

666
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:31,619
every changes we make Israel eat kinda
change one of these three things

667
00:38:31,619 --> 00:38:35,440
arm first strained silicon I I forget
the year

668
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:38,650
people started doing this it was like
2004

669
00:38:38,650 --> 00:38:41,890
um its controlling

670
00:38:41,890 --> 00:38:47,109
in a way the electrical properties you
deposit a layer on top

671
00:38:47,109 --> 00:38:50,730
arm daddy's Larkin so pure silicon atoms
there

672
00:38:50,730 --> 00:38:54,290
this close together we deposit something
like silicon germanium

673
00:38:54,290 --> 00:38:57,509
on top of it misses I guess those
pictures upside down

674
00:38:57,510 --> 00:39:01,910
it stretches are silicon I depending on
the device type we might want to stretch

675
00:39:01,910 --> 00:39:02,569
it out

676
00:39:02,569 --> 00:39:06,470
we might want to push it together we can
use that to control

677
00:39:06,470 --> 00:39:09,770
the electron mobility the silicon we can
make things faster we can make

678
00:39:09,770 --> 00:39:14,759
slower we knew everyone on this is
credited with a 35 percent

679
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:19,109
improvement in transistors be once

680
00:39:19,109 --> 00:39:23,480
is actually up forty sucks but one
change one design shit

681
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:27,690
next us is a strained silicon practice
here's our transistor

682
00:39:27,690 --> 00:39:31,420
strain channel we put it in there we
spread the sort Adams out

683
00:39:31,420 --> 00:39:36,270
we've created less traffic the problem
is we have to do other things because

684
00:39:36,270 --> 00:39:40,750
less traffic means Italy but the ability
to have less traffic means we can start

685
00:39:40,750 --> 00:39:42,010
doing other things

686
00:39:42,010 --> 00:39:46,349
we also start straining the source in
the drain it allows us to do even more

687
00:39:46,349 --> 00:39:47,319
detail control

688
00:39:47,319 --> 00:39:50,680
then and this is very high level but
very more detail control

689
00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:53,960
then the I'm opens on

690
00:39:53,960 --> 00:39:56,960
how the transistors behave how that
source in the dream him what the

691
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:59,730
electoral properties Mr

692
00:39:59,730 --> 00:40:03,290
so alright high-k metal gate if you're
serious

693
00:40:03,290 --> 00:40:07,020
Intel pimps this very hard other people
are doing it as well

694
00:40:07,020 --> 00:40:12,150
it's not just so couple size I showed 8
2010 are a transistor with a

695
00:40:12,150 --> 00:40:15,670
normal key was for for Adams right

696
00:40:15,670 --> 00:40:19,430
you can't manufacture really thinner
than that with a sort of quality control

697
00:40:19,430 --> 00:40:22,629
soul the only way to do it is we needed
to

698
00:40:22,630 --> 00:40:27,089
act electrically like it's dinner so we
make it stick

699
00:40:27,089 --> 00:40:30,569
Wii U removed from silicon dioxide to

700
00:40:30,569 --> 00:40:34,430
other materials with different on
cautions

701
00:40:34,430 --> 00:40:37,779
that allow us to make it thicker will
make an electrically act

702
00:40:37,780 --> 00:40:40,810
Center om has it's really just I'm

703
00:40:40,810 --> 00:40:44,180
too thin to be practical awesome
material changes

704
00:40:44,180 --> 00:40:48,500
here's what it looks like your Tom
silicon substrate Hughes Rd

705
00:40:48,500 --> 00:40:51,580
I and you see metal gate which is the
second technology will talk about that

706
00:40:51,580 --> 00:40:54,980
a second and here's the high-k we had
four monolayers

707
00:40:54,980 --> 00:40:58,040
can see there's a lot of monolayers the
law

708
00:40:58,040 --> 00:41:02,730
that's good for the areas were making
things bigger makes things better

709
00:41:02,730 --> 00:41:07,270
it's rare in this world um the other one
is metal gate

710
00:41:07,270 --> 00:41:10,430
so really desire to technologies that
kinda got issues

711
00:41:10,430 --> 00:41:14,759
same time because it's in sector
manufacturing reasons but

712
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:18,130
the metal gate is here's your hike 8
I'll

713
00:41:18,130 --> 00:41:21,240
I lectured and you're starting to do
different

714
00:41:21,240 --> 00:41:25,280
things in here besides poly silicon the
advantages metal has far lower

715
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:27,450
resistance than the policy

716
00:41:27,450 --> 00:41:30,650
it's more efficient we can do things
faster

717
00:41:30,650 --> 00:41:34,060
lower leakage the differences very

718
00:41:34,060 --> 00:41:37,900
touch I'll that deep drive step that I
talked about we're moving to open

719
00:41:37,900 --> 00:41:40,980
surround can you be any manufacturing
process

720
00:41:40,980 --> 00:41:44,780
will destroy your day if you're not
careful see have to be very very careful

721
00:41:44,780 --> 00:41:47,990
very fragile on metal was actually the
original

722
00:41:47,990 --> 00:41:51,250
material the use back in the seventies
and so forth

723
00:41:51,250 --> 00:41:54,950
four gates they got away from it because
it had manufacturing issues

724
00:41:54,950 --> 00:41:58,230
the don't have a choice now they have to
go back to it to keep the improvement of

725
00:41:58,230 --> 00:42:01,420
what they want cell so here's how it
looks

726
00:42:01,420 --> 00:42:04,670
so the gayest holler

727
00:42:04,670 --> 00:42:08,420
and then this goes from being one step
something stacked up

728
00:42:08,420 --> 00:42:11,440
Southside stacked on the top it to

729
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:15,450
why don't wanna reveal anything but a
lot of different steps

730
00:42:15,450 --> 00:42:19,089
a lot of different materials because
what you're doing is you're engineering

731
00:42:19,089 --> 00:42:23,490
an electrical field here by how you
stack medals

732
00:42:23,490 --> 00:42:28,460
here and how you flow electricity so we
can control that feel better

733
00:42:28,460 --> 00:42:32,319
we can target that field I N there's
been some

734
00:42:32,319 --> 00:42:35,920
theoretical research done on basically
using antenna theory where it's

735
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:39,530
normally a field is right fairly
ubiquitous nearly circular

736
00:42:39,530 --> 00:42:43,380
at FM antennas they can do directional
antennas

737
00:42:43,380 --> 00:42:46,960
interference they're starting to talk
about using that here so that our field

738
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:48,359
goes here

739
00:42:48,359 --> 00:42:51,890
and doesn't go here in here that's
hugely beneficial because we can put

740
00:42:51,890 --> 00:42:54,879
transistors closer together

741
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:58,060
so order operations going back to

742
00:42:58,060 --> 00:43:02,040
what I how much do these are the steps
the

743
00:43:02,040 --> 00:43:05,890
gate insulator was the first thing right

744
00:43:05,890 --> 00:43:10,410
that doesn't work anymore with a lot of
new technology the gates are fragile

745
00:43:10,410 --> 00:43:14,040
the high came gates or fraud I kick its
leaders are fragile

746
00:43:14,040 --> 00:43:17,460
the metal gates are from cell we build
them last

747
00:43:17,460 --> 00:43:21,549
but we still need that key their to
define our transistor ship sell

748
00:43:21,549 --> 00:43:25,330
we move from the county first which is
where we do the key first two date last

749
00:43:25,330 --> 00:43:28,759
what the last releases in most cases d
first

750
00:43:28,759 --> 00:43:32,560
and then do it again last cell we got
the gate

751
00:43:32,560 --> 00:43:37,000
then we removed so this creates on
proscar the spacers are still there and

752
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:37,819
this is

753
00:43:37,819 --> 00:43:40,980
and over dramatization of what's going
on but it works

754
00:43:40,980 --> 00:43:44,560
arm the spacers are still there but we
have nothing here

755
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:49,200
we might have a little layer silicon
dioxide still in there but character

756
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:52,220
then we put our hike again with her
Holgate

757
00:43:52,220 --> 00:43:56,940
because we had the spacers there we have
to be very careful how we feel this this

758
00:43:56,940 --> 00:43:57,480
is where

759
00:43:57,480 --> 00:44:00,620
alte comes in as otherwise me and big
open legal

760
00:44:00,620 --> 00:44:03,660
void whole inside the key the socket

761
00:44:03,660 --> 00:44:07,240
doesn't works om and we build

762
00:44:07,240 --> 00:44:11,490
everything else normally right that
icing is in some cases you can get rid

763
00:44:11,490 --> 00:44:12,430
of the south side

764
00:44:12,430 --> 00:44:17,450
on top gay wish for it does remove steps
because it's metalitz easier to connect

765
00:44:17,450 --> 00:44:21,799
cell back depletion up till now we
talked about

766
00:44:21,799 --> 00:44:25,660
building things on our nice blue I don't
know why sulcus blue but it's blue

767
00:44:25,660 --> 00:44:29,399
I substrate the problem is

768
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:34,589
all that energy all those electrons can
we crown axle semiconductors not really

769
00:44:34,589 --> 00:44:37,799
electrically conductive it's not really
a slave years kinda in the middle

770
00:44:37,799 --> 00:44:41,500
we take advantage when we start to have
problems with things

771
00:44:41,500 --> 00:44:45,230
leaking all over the place that we want
something to build on that is more

772
00:44:45,230 --> 00:44:48,850
electrically resist we want to totally
customize

773
00:44:48,850 --> 00:44:53,029
everything about this transistor silicon
wafer is it a good starting point

774
00:44:53,029 --> 00:44:57,130
so person we do put ice layer dialect we
just say

775
00:44:57,130 --> 00:45:01,250
to hack with this way for or we might
even change out the entire way

776
00:45:01,250 --> 00:45:04,350
say Rakhi Sawant name or email you
something else courts

777
00:45:04,350 --> 00:45:08,230
is one of the ones it's been proposed
then we put our own substrate

778
00:45:08,230 --> 00:45:11,380
then we put our own semiconducting
material that to this point we just

779
00:45:11,380 --> 00:45:12,310
replicated the work

780
00:45:12,310 --> 00:45:15,450
of the way for but in a much much more
controlled fashion

781
00:45:15,450 --> 00:45:19,750
this is the exact thickness that we want
it's the exact material that we want

782
00:45:19,750 --> 00:45:24,069
dope at the we only have exactly what we
want for starting point

783
00:45:24,069 --> 00:45:27,779
then we do normal trench our normal
isolation trenches to this point I know

784
00:45:27,779 --> 00:45:28,790
have

785
00:45:28,790 --> 00:45:33,120
almost Faraday cage in fact fairy cage
but it

786
00:45:33,120 --> 00:45:37,380
eyes where I can build my transistor its
isolated on all three sides I don't just

787
00:45:37,380 --> 00:45:38,819
have a site isolation

788
00:45:38,819 --> 00:45:43,200
like I do now isolated the bottom two
electrons can't ski

789
00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:46,279
out of then everything else same

790
00:45:46,279 --> 00:45:52,040
it's just compressed it's a lot smaller
area we can control it a lot more

791
00:45:52,040 --> 00:45:55,740
ends up with the same transistor sitting
on top of a nice piece of insulating

792
00:45:55,740 --> 00:45:57,880
material

793
00:45:57,880 --> 00:46:01,170
it helps every here's the last

794
00:46:01,170 --> 00:46:04,230
arm so Intel

795
00:46:04,230 --> 00:46:07,690
least these in a way they said 2011

796
00:46:07,690 --> 00:46:11,799
and the press releases like they've been
working on it since 2007 or before

797
00:46:11,799 --> 00:46:15,210
finfacts on everything

798
00:46:15,210 --> 00:46:18,630
as I said is about turning things on and
off faster better

799
00:46:18,630 --> 00:46:23,910
offer are we have this year this is our
standard design explainer

800
00:46:23,910 --> 00:46:27,430
the key is on top the gate is basically
interrupting

801
00:46:27,430 --> 00:46:31,759
flow this one om if you think about

802
00:46:31,759 --> 00:46:35,029
think about a a lens of a camera be for
your camera lenses

803
00:46:35,029 --> 00:46:38,869
you have your aperture if I

804
00:46:38,869 --> 00:46:42,230
had eighty aperture and I just closed it
from the top

805
00:46:42,230 --> 00:46:45,770
that'll take a certain amount time for
to travel the distance steady spiral

806
00:46:45,770 --> 00:46:46,540
lectures

807
00:46:46,540 --> 00:46:50,369
I have an aperture if in fact all three
sides I

808
00:46:50,369 --> 00:46:55,100
gate on all three sides I can close out
of much faster I can generate feel much

809
00:46:55,100 --> 00:46:56,390
faster

810
00:46:56,390 --> 00:47:00,118
I can improve everything about the
transistor

811
00:47:00,119 --> 00:47:03,660
this is what they look like you're not
growing silicon teens

812
00:47:03,660 --> 00:47:08,009
in the space um what you're seeing here
is they're actually starting to rather

813
00:47:08,009 --> 00:47:11,970
building one transistor their building
one transistor

814
00:47:11,970 --> 00:47:15,290
that they can there so from a survey

815
00:47:15,290 --> 00:47:17,740
the used to use different size
transistors different sized mayor

816
00:47:17,740 --> 00:47:18,900
transistors for different

817
00:47:18,900 --> 00:47:22,799
power different voltages things like
that in this they've moved away from

818
00:47:22,799 --> 00:47:23,369
that model

819
00:47:23,369 --> 00:47:26,970
you make one size fit it's very hard to
go the things we don't want to try and

820
00:47:26,970 --> 00:47:27,339
produce

821
00:47:27,339 --> 00:47:30,660
to or five different sites say 1 and
then they

822
00:47:30,660 --> 00:47:34,210
link them together like this so what
you're looking at here is you see the

823
00:47:34,210 --> 00:47:35,339
ones that go in this direction

824
00:47:35,339 --> 00:47:40,009
does the fins those are our source in
our drain they just stick up

825
00:47:40,009 --> 00:47:43,319
so because they're the stickup
electricity still flows in same

826
00:47:43,319 --> 00:47:44,770
direction

827
00:47:44,770 --> 00:47:49,529
and then we are key Rd surrounds all
three sides you can see that here

828
00:47:49,529 --> 00:47:53,470
here surfin now we have gate all 3 sites
everywhere you look

829
00:47:53,470 --> 00:47:57,000
there's a lot more T a lot closer to the
source and drain

830
00:47:57,000 --> 00:48:02,180
so what does that do in terms of
performance

831
00:48:02,180 --> 00:48:07,180
power 50 percent lower

832
00:48:07,180 --> 00:48:10,259
while also not or also

833
00:48:10,259 --> 00:48:14,000
being forty percent faster

834
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:19,440
the trade-off its socks to build these
things

835
00:48:19,440 --> 00:48:24,240
I don't know how intel does it i wish i
did. I wish I could tell people and find

836
00:48:24,240 --> 00:48:24,839
out

837
00:48:24,839 --> 00:48:28,779
I have my guess is I don't know it's
incredible

838
00:48:28,779 --> 00:48:32,450
up so here is our the black lines
traditional transistor

839
00:48:32,450 --> 00:48:36,170
the blue lines are kinda our choices
what we can start

840
00:48:36,170 --> 00:48:40,220
do you with the trike its and this is
the first generation trike

841
00:48:40,220 --> 00:48:44,460
its om egos even further you can
theoretically doing T

842
00:48:44,460 --> 00:48:47,910
all around which means you have to build
the game of the transistor to which

843
00:48:47,910 --> 00:48:48,540
means you're doing

844
00:48:48,540 --> 00:48:52,890
eat first team in the middle last I
don't know if anyone has gotten

845
00:48:52,890 --> 00:48:55,920
the manufacturing that right

846
00:48:55,920 --> 00:48:59,200
sup where he had I

847
00:48:59,200 --> 00:49:02,490
may have this year Paul Otellini who is

848
00:49:02,490 --> 00:49:06,290
I don't know what you did in telling
your buddies I'll I think you never

849
00:49:06,290 --> 00:49:07,630
tired

850
00:49:07,630 --> 00:49:11,960
disclosed and noms it was a quarterly
earnings call

851
00:49:11,960 --> 00:49:16,940
that they're doing seven and your device
R&D in 2011 a number of different

852
00:49:16,940 --> 00:49:18,049
company started selling

853
00:49:18,049 --> 00:49:21,600
fat 22 nanometer transistors tumor that
human hair

854
00:49:21,600 --> 00:49:26,529
forty am yours yeah I'm 14 and appears
on track

855
00:49:26,529 --> 00:49:29,810
from what I've in toll 4 2013

856
00:49:29,810 --> 00:49:33,359
so we in two years we can go from twenty
see a mere 14

857
00:49:33,359 --> 00:49:36,790
here its not really a structural change
because

858
00:49:36,790 --> 00:49:39,869
they don't have tried it's right nobody
us com

859
00:49:39,869 --> 00:49:43,109
laps docked it's really refinement

860
00:49:43,109 --> 00:49:48,509
everything some people are talking about
transitioning to 450 millimeter-wave

861
00:49:48,509 --> 00:49:52,700
sites those half meter diameter wafers
on

862
00:49:52,700 --> 00:49:58,029
2015 this is in development this is not
an research this isn't develop

863
00:49:58,029 --> 00:50:02,040
you know bell labs you know the
difference on lithography uses

864
00:50:02,040 --> 00:50:05,859
is their families as they called tipple
patterning so we talk about the

865
00:50:05,859 --> 00:50:07,060
photography

866
00:50:07,060 --> 00:50:11,200
if I shoot the party wants I end up with
something looks certain ways patterns a

867
00:50:11,200 --> 00:50:12,009
certain way

868
00:50:12,009 --> 00:50:15,190
if I using different photo versus that
requires rather than

869
00:50:15,190 --> 00:50:18,400
one photon and I do mean one photon to

870
00:50:18,400 --> 00:50:22,500
polymer rise an individual strand use it
it requires two

871
00:50:22,500 --> 00:50:25,600
that's double patterning is this is a
horrible

872
00:50:25,600 --> 00:50:28,770
description of it go look it up on week

873
00:50:28,770 --> 00:50:31,220
because the people who write these
things on Wikipedia work I don't know

874
00:50:31,220 --> 00:50:33,989
who they work for that work for somebody
who knows what they're talking about

875
00:50:33,989 --> 00:50:37,420
printable patting patterning is taking
five

876
00:50:37,420 --> 00:50:40,549
shots oval the tiger beetle to generate

877
00:50:40,549 --> 00:50:43,549
one thing and this is uses averaging

878
00:50:43,549 --> 00:50:47,130
up combination different masks different
techniques

879
00:50:47,130 --> 00:50:50,560
so that you can use all those together
to generate what you want

880
00:50:50,560 --> 00:50:54,430
on at this point that's theorized dot
sematech says

881
00:50:54,430 --> 00:50:57,600
high-k that thicker gate that were used

882
00:50:57,600 --> 00:51:01,020
is now a monolayer one one layer

883
00:51:01,020 --> 00:51:04,660
one atomic layer collector so we are
back again

884
00:51:04,660 --> 00:51:09,250
high-k becomes alter high K we just find
a different material because

885
00:51:09,250 --> 00:51:13,040
if they can do that I'm I'm gonna use
only high five

886
00:51:13,040 --> 00:51:16,440
I'll lots of problems here

887
00:51:16,440 --> 00:51:20,130
Intel and IBM have publicly discussed
solving the problem

888
00:51:20,130 --> 00:51:25,190
11 and I'm here by skipping at that
point

889
00:51:25,190 --> 00:51:29,660
we're no longer in their
microelectronics wear nail trucks

890
00:51:29,660 --> 00:51:33,859
2017 2019 that's what they're talking
about doing

891
00:51:33,859 --> 00:51:38,830
re: research on now I'll the device size
seven and eight years

892
00:51:38,830 --> 00:51:43,630
you can't get away from using UV on just
the UV light the use now

893
00:51:43,630 --> 00:51:47,210
can't reach that at all just falls apart

894
00:51:47,210 --> 00:51:51,989
up you be like I said doesn't work Intel
just invested a billion dollars in ASML

895
00:51:51,989 --> 00:51:55,520
is a major vendor to try and make TUV
work

896
00:51:55,520 --> 00:51:59,660
it doesn't work there's a lot of there
are people in the field who say

897
00:51:59,660 --> 00:52:03,259
it will never work because you're trying
to use a

898
00:52:03,259 --> 00:52:06,730
for to react polymer any back in
chambers a mayor

899
00:52:06,730 --> 00:52:09,750
know anything about back in chambers it
will

900
00:52:09,750 --> 00:52:13,119
you're talking about something that's
for solvents when you put on the way for

901
00:52:13,119 --> 00:52:16,160
he will outcast so it's how do you
prevent everything from out gassing

902
00:52:16,160 --> 00:52:19,220
because if you are out gassing out
gassing up of the way for

903
00:52:19,220 --> 00:52:23,440
is in between the way from the less you
have gas we didn't want gas nothing

904
00:52:23,440 --> 00:52:29,049
work cell that'll be interesting to Sol
then things get worse

905
00:52:29,049 --> 00:52:32,819
um electrical interconnect start to have

906
00:52:32,819 --> 00:52:36,420
your problems just because making things
that are electrically conductive that

907
00:52:36,420 --> 00:52:37,130
small

908
00:52:37,130 --> 00:52:40,850
they start talking about optical
interconnects I

909
00:52:40,850 --> 00:52:44,089
they're talking about using rather than
really what I would call

910
00:52:44,089 --> 00:52:47,109
digital a quantum transistors two morow
what they're calling

911
00:52:47,109 --> 00:52:50,630
interference transistors where the
electrons interfere with one another

912
00:52:50,630 --> 00:52:55,080
and kinda quasi turn it on and off they
don't really turn it on and off

913
00:52:55,080 --> 00:52:58,350
the just thing the transistor think
that's honor of it still flowing

914
00:52:58,350 --> 00:53:01,310
up they're controlling where electricity
is coming from and constructive and

915
00:53:01,310 --> 00:53:04,109
destructive place

916
00:53:04,109 --> 00:53:07,160
out kinda ran off the bottom here 2022

917
00:53:07,160 --> 00:53:11,210
for an animator I'll there's a lot of
ideas

918
00:53:11,210 --> 00:53:14,480
here ranging from quantum two things are
more exotic than quantum

919
00:53:14,480 --> 00:53:18,619
I'll right now anything that's built the
decisive

920
00:53:18,619 --> 00:53:22,540
actually time arm is done using a

921
00:53:22,540 --> 00:53:25,700
scanning tunneling microscope what
they're doing is they're not building

922
00:53:25,700 --> 00:53:26,460
things

923
00:53:26,460 --> 00:53:31,060
there manually stacking aP's to make a
transistor current from what I've seen

924
00:53:31,060 --> 00:53:32,819
the current winner

925
00:53:32,819 --> 00:53:36,109
is a group that will be 38 Adam
transistor

926
00:53:36,109 --> 00:53:40,520
sup why is this here well

927
00:53:40,520 --> 00:53:43,970
here's like a every single computer chip
every single

928
00:53:43,970 --> 00:53:48,690
being in your pocket uses stuff om this
is kinda how I got interested in it like

929
00:53:48,690 --> 00:53:52,640
I'm interesting coating on a mechanical
engineer this was a good fit for your

930
00:53:52,640 --> 00:53:55,470
car has the sings it everything as

931
00:53:55,470 --> 00:53:59,230
I want more cuts I thought you guys
might want to know more about it too

932
00:53:59,230 --> 00:54:02,230
I talked to a couple people and I just
started talking about it because I

933
00:54:02,230 --> 00:54:06,920
you of this field and they just sat
there like oh my god

934
00:54:06,920 --> 00:54:10,589
I know right it's like oh hell

935
00:54:10,589 --> 00:54:13,630
just might think that is so here here we
are sup

936
00:54:13,630 --> 00:54:16,650
up last like less request I at

937
00:54:16,650 --> 00:54:23,650
nine minutes I actually did this right
on time which is creep

938
00:54:31,040 --> 00:54:34,239
I have my Moore's law teacher on

939
00:54:34,239 --> 00:54:40,020
morse okay that's the wrong question to
ask I'm sorry

940
00:54:40,020 --> 00:54:43,029
know it's almost like isn't just about
sites

941
00:54:43,029 --> 00:54:46,200
what is it about dance there's a lot of
things are going to density

942
00:54:46,200 --> 00:54:50,660
beyond just how small we can manufacture
some but it's not just about density

943
00:54:50,660 --> 00:54:51,190
either to

944
00:54:51,190 --> 00:54:54,410
price as these things mature the

945
00:54:54,410 --> 00:54:57,629
to get cheap Moore's Law got

946
00:54:57,630 --> 00:55:00,710
I T a decade left in it before it
becomes a problem and that's

947
00:55:00,710 --> 00:55:04,600
more going to be costs driven than
anything else

948
00:55:04,600 --> 00:55:08,259
so other questions you ask anything I
have to backup site

949
00:55:08,259 --> 00:55:15,259
yes

950
00:55:17,350 --> 00:55:23,190
neutrinos are propped I the so what what
are the standard

951
00:55:23,190 --> 00:55:26,839
a research and development quality
control tools is

952
00:55:26,839 --> 00:55:29,890
on take one chip

953
00:55:29,890 --> 00:55:33,950
you set two chips runs in Test 30 take
one down a mine

954
00:55:33,950 --> 00:55:37,020
and take one of an airplane you that

955
00:55:37,020 --> 00:55:40,900
used to be a problem they've just kinda
everybody has taken the approach

956
00:55:40,900 --> 00:55:43,930
it's a problem will deliver software

957
00:55:43,930 --> 00:55:47,049
will deliver a rich checking in circuit
design on because

958
00:55:47,049 --> 00:55:50,410
if you look at the statistics those
neutrino collisions

959
00:55:50,410 --> 00:55:54,890
its it happens it does happen

960
00:55:54,890 --> 00:55:59,140
but if it's not going to happen odds
having the same place

961
00:55:59,140 --> 00:56:03,580
in two different parts to the chip same
time highly highly unlikely

962
00:56:03,580 --> 00:56:07,259
om the what there was a

963
00:56:07,259 --> 00:56:11,020
this sorry

964
00:56:11,020 --> 00:56:17,670
others yes

965
00:56:17,670 --> 00:56:20,110
he asked about doping migration so if

966
00:56:20,110 --> 00:56:27,110
I'm going to backwards here slide us

967
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:28,260
to

968
00:56:28,260 --> 00:56:33,180
depletion yet so when he says doping
migration we have those

969
00:56:33,180 --> 00:56:37,870
arm used laser pointer point the suckers

970
00:56:37,870 --> 00:56:42,120
the sources in dreams when we put
impurities

971
00:56:42,120 --> 00:56:46,000
in there they do have a tendency to over
time

972
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:49,840
around are its the law of diffusion it's
it's a physics problem

973
00:56:49,840 --> 00:56:53,940
it hotter than shit gets the more likely
it is higher user cycles

974
00:56:53,940 --> 00:56:57,380
I I would respond I have a saying
depletion %uh

975
00:56:57,380 --> 00:57:01,340
fully depleted will help because is less
electron mobility

976
00:57:01,340 --> 00:57:05,310
in these areas means they're less likely
to move around the other thing is

977
00:57:05,310 --> 00:57:09,490
it depend it depends on

978
00:57:09,490 --> 00:57:12,950
which wait your street if you're yes

979
00:57:12,950 --> 00:57:17,050
yeah its side it's it's physics arm

980
00:57:17,050 --> 00:57:20,360
I don't think people keep these chips
long enough for two people

981
00:57:20,360 --> 00:57:24,450
if you look at the refresh cycle so most
if you're talking a bank summit this

982
00:57:24,450 --> 00:57:25,650
high frequency trading

983
00:57:25,650 --> 00:57:29,120
the NSA they save money

984
00:57:29,120 --> 00:57:32,520
the chips are getting so much better so
much faster for me

985
00:57:32,520 --> 00:57:36,400
our alone stemming from a power in
computational density

986
00:57:36,400 --> 00:57:40,440
company you know instructions for what
competition for what

987
00:57:40,440 --> 00:57:46,350
standpoint that they can replace them
every 18 months to make money it saves

988
00:57:46,350 --> 00:57:48,060
them money to replace them every team's

989
00:57:48,060 --> 00:57:55,060
in back

990
00:58:05,180 --> 00:58:09,210
the so the question was R&D costs are
spiraling ridiculously out of control

991
00:58:09,210 --> 00:58:12,750
om what's gonna happen to competition in
the industry

992
00:58:12,750 --> 00:58:16,289
I so currently

993
00:58:16,289 --> 00:58:19,390
to answer questions there is more than
one third the company bomb

994
00:58:19,390 --> 00:58:22,839
yeah I i know im but its it's a I am

995
00:58:22,839 --> 00:58:27,619
I consider it a problem as a as a hacker
as a as a person who wants to buy these

996
00:58:27,619 --> 00:58:28,220
things for

997
00:58:28,220 --> 00:58:32,619
the least amount of money possible on
are it's not so much the cost

998
00:58:32,619 --> 00:58:36,359
as the difficult I mean

999
00:58:36,359 --> 00:58:40,529
its you're going to see contraction

1000
00:58:40,529 --> 00:58:44,480
but do doosy I think inherent natural
trait of these things is

1001
00:58:44,480 --> 00:58:48,759
the companies that do the company's it
in manufacturing and do the tool

1002
00:58:48,759 --> 00:58:49,380
development

1003
00:58:49,380 --> 00:58:52,769
archive very very closely interrelated
and

1004
00:58:52,769 --> 00:58:56,150
because it that they have very clear
path their mind they don't always

1005
00:58:56,150 --> 00:58:59,710
tend to think creatively Lake hackers

1006
00:58:59,710 --> 00:59:03,630
I like like academics do on you're
seeing

1007
00:59:03,630 --> 00:59:08,039
with atomic layer deposition is is a
great example all the major tool vendors

1008
00:59:08,039 --> 00:59:11,549
is right see 5 major to lenders have

1009
00:59:11,549 --> 00:59:15,690
LD systems is also pits crop a lot of
smaller companies

1010
00:59:15,690 --> 00:59:18,980
that have credible guilty tools because

1011
00:59:18,980 --> 00:59:23,180
that's all they do because they have
people who did research on this

1012
00:59:23,180 --> 00:59:26,940
and they've worked all developers they
were scientists and the hooked up with

1013
00:59:26,940 --> 00:59:28,819
engineers they're doing really neat
things

1014
00:59:28,819 --> 00:59:33,880
from from standpoint the intel's the
GlobalFoundries

1015
00:59:33,880 --> 00:59:37,750
IBM's the TSMC's you're going to see
narrowing

1016
00:59:37,750 --> 00:59:41,309
I the the industry itself though at
least

1017
00:59:41,309 --> 00:59:45,069
outsiders I miss a outside logic is
fairly competitive

1018
00:59:45,069 --> 00:59:49,049
and that will I think keep prices down
but I'm not I'm not a business guy I'm

1019
00:59:49,049 --> 00:59:53,119
I'm not economic system do there are
definitely some structural problems is

1020
00:59:53,119 --> 00:59:54,329
likely 450

1021
00:59:54,329 --> 00:59:58,250
is going to cost anybody who wants to
build a 450 millimeter toward

1022
00:59:58,250 --> 01:00:02,390
massive weaver's be lot of money and so
you will see some contraction

1023
01:00:02,390 --> 01:00:07,868
all I can see is what I can say week see
I'd don't anybody else

1024
01:00:07,869 --> 01:00:14,869
in the way way back I can just barely
see I

1025
01:00:16,940 --> 01:00:22,829
I can't hear you

1026
01:00:22,829 --> 01:00:26,140
so he asked will see fit which is
focused

1027
01:00:26,140 --> 01:00:32,700
ion p I huh the the physics

1028
01:00:32,700 --> 01:00:36,359
right now other did the the right now
says we almost have to

1029
01:00:36,359 --> 01:00:41,859
om whether it's I don't know how they
make it realistic for manufacture

1030
01:00:41,859 --> 01:00:45,009
technology for so yes you'll have
focused ion beam

1031
01:00:45,010 --> 01:00:48,500
it's cool it's how you can basically
Adam by Adam

1032
01:00:48,500 --> 01:00:51,810
manufacture things I don't know how they
can make it work

1033
01:00:51,810 --> 01:00:56,420
so its 12:57 I got is that this one more
question

1034
01:00:56,420 --> 01:00:59,619
yeah alongside

1035
01:00:59,619 --> 01:01:06,619
right there

1036
01:01:11,990 --> 01:01:15,270
I don't know it scares me that's

1037
01:01:15,270 --> 01:01:17,599
someplace I thanks I don't
