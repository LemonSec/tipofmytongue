1
00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:04,890
my name is Gerber and I this card this
card is open is covered in spiders and

2
00:00:04,890 --> 00:00:08,480
this is because after I'm done here I
hope you'll be looking your cell phone

3
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:10,760
as if it were covered in spiders or
cockroaches

4
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:14,820
or whatever other bug you don't like so
I'm

5
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:18,619
how many have you in here have an iPhone
alright but I wouldn't have played

6
00:00:18,619 --> 00:00:19,259
backup

7
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:24,920
just a cracker County be on your iPhone
to get your very how many have a

8
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:29,769
black bear a couple more how many how to
add a Windows Mobile

9
00:00:29,769 --> 00:00:33,460
Mike Palm OS

10
00:00:33,460 --> 00:00:37,149
ir and writer yeah

11
00:00:37,149 --> 00:00:40,469
okay so the stock is mostly gonna be
about Android but

12
00:00:40,469 --> 00:00:44,280
ok so I'm

13
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:48,760
were becoming increasingly dependent on
mobile devices and restoring more and

14
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:50,210
more data on them pictures

15
00:00:50,210 --> 00:00:53,760
videos contact with on record a

16
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:57,899
anywhere you ever band and if you watch
the rum Baba talk earlier today record

17
00:00:57,899 --> 00:01:02,120
basically everything you've ever done I
N you have about as many gadget is this

18
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:02,730
guy does

19
00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:07,390
I am on your phone social graph also two
interesting things

20
00:01:07,390 --> 00:01:10,939
I am and the amount of data that we're
storing increases

21
00:01:10,939 --> 00:01:14,570
the amount of complexity on the platform
increases the phone now

22
00:01:14,570 --> 00:01:17,610
is obviously a much more complicated
piece that it was even

23
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:22,110
five years ago and add the complete
increases the desirability a bit as a

24
00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:23,290
target increases

25
00:01:23,290 --> 00:01:26,470
and the number a boner abilities in the
platform

26
00:01:26,470 --> 00:01:29,548
increase so it's really a perfect storm
and her a lot

27
00:01:29,549 --> 00:01:34,439
a vulnerability in mobile devices so
what sort of threat models

28
00:01:34,439 --> 00:01:37,909
are we talking about arm random attack

29
00:01:37,909 --> 00:01:41,329
break malicious applications I

30
00:01:41,329 --> 00:01:44,250
which usually are really targeting
anybody but is trying to set up but

31
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:44,899
North

32
00:01:44,899 --> 00:01:49,380
I have not heard namely in particular
are stolen last month it happens a lot

33
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:51,929
it's a little piece of hardware that in
your pocket easy to lose

34
00:01:51,930 --> 00:01:55,549
there's also targeted attacks from law
enforcement

35
00:01:55,549 --> 00:01:58,860
I if you're a personal interest or

36
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:03,759
corporate espionage I am or personal
enemies if you have a job to clobber

37
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:06,790
I and then there's

38
00:02:06,790 --> 00:02:09,840
attacks or somewhere in between which
are things like

39
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:13,470
I signal interception I you know
intercepting

40
00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:17,260
men in the middle innings ensure your
phone calls or your data arm

41
00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:22,890
or your phone company doing essentially
the same thing so

42
00:02:22,890 --> 00:02:26,970
something to keep in mind before we
start this talk if somebody gets

43
00:02:26,970 --> 00:02:28,629
physical access to your phone

44
00:02:28,629 --> 00:02:32,329
you should assume your phone can and
will be compromised and

45
00:02:32,330 --> 00:02:35,989
if you assume anything less I feel like
I'm doing you wrong

46
00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:39,019
arm because honestly probably will

47
00:02:39,019 --> 00:02:43,280
the phone is a lot like a laptop want to
prisoners physical access to it

48
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:48,030
there's really no limit to the things
they can do you should also

49
00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:54,160
your best of assuming your phone will be
compromised at some point there's

50
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:57,940
a lot of attack vectors and if you think
your phone

51
00:02:57,940 --> 00:03:02,129
as a device that will be compromised
than your store less sensitive data on

52
00:03:02,129 --> 00:03:02,409
it

53
00:03:02,409 --> 00:03:05,569
a or your store that data better

54
00:03:05,569 --> 00:03:08,750
I included for example and that's really
what I want

55
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:13,150
so security is a journey not a
destination now

56
00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:17,450
and we're never gonna have perfect
security but the goal is not a private

57
00:03:17,450 --> 00:03:18,890
security the goal is to put up

58
00:03:18,890 --> 00:03:22,080
more hurdles to make it harder for the
attacker

59
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:26,000
the medical questionnaire that their
time energy and resources needed a

60
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,110
compromise you

61
00:03:27,110 --> 00:03:30,569
need to be greater than the
determination if your attacker

62
00:03:30,569 --> 00:03:35,549
so if your threat model is the NSA that
a lot but if you're threat model

63
00:03:35,549 --> 00:03:39,620
is a random person on the street

64
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:43,720
it's not so much and just because there
are so many threats

65
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:46,580
doesn't mean the UK shouldn't take
security seriously there's a lot of

66
00:03:46,580 --> 00:03:49,690
things that you can still be ok

67
00:03:49,690 --> 00:03:53,129
so I R burner pans real quick

68
00:03:53,129 --> 00:03:56,179
are you on your banner is

69
00:03:56,180 --> 00:04:01,010
I bernard et Peter Pan or the Nokia
brick found something that place

70
00:04:01,010 --> 00:04:04,280
snake arm ok

71
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:07,480
be youth have no encryption

72
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:11,290
there'd trivial for their tribute to
perform forensic science reveal to

73
00:04:11,290 --> 00:04:12,569
extract data from

74
00:04:12,569 --> 00:04:16,690
I always closed doors and they don't
even have a scream %ah

75
00:04:16,690 --> 00:04:20,810
oftentimes the one thing they are good
for is if you go by

76
00:04:20,810 --> 00:04:24,520
disposable mobile phone is not actually
connected to you

77
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:27,570
I if you pay in cash in blah blah blah

78
00:04:27,570 --> 00:04:30,770
so that a slight advantage I

79
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:34,880
if you use it once or twice and drove
away it could be argued that that more

80
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:35,389
secure

81
00:04:35,389 --> 00:04:39,259
but you don't get things like ingrid
conversations are incurred to text

82
00:04:39,259 --> 00:04:39,750
messages

83
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:43,830
so the iPhone for that review that raise
your hand

84
00:04:43,830 --> 00:04:47,120
I am the bad it has closed doors

85
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:50,150
and it's a well-guarded a Micah a

86
00:04:50,150 --> 00:04:54,000
and with Parker I think from the EFSF
just read a really great blog blog

87
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,340
article about a

88
00:04:55,340 --> 00:04:59,030
about a Apple's walled garden

89
00:04:59,030 --> 00:05:02,729
on and there's not much in the way
security app from what I could tell

90
00:05:02,729 --> 00:05:06,090
a again I don't own an iPhone so I could
be wrong here

91
00:05:06,090 --> 00:05:10,610
but from what i've seen and upholstery
mark is piss poor

92
00:05:10,610 --> 00:05:14,009
four-digit numbers easily guessed
especially since most people to things

93
00:05:14,009 --> 00:05:16,729
like one two three four and 11 11

94
00:05:16,729 --> 00:05:20,979
and the same smudge it actual talk later
also work against iPhone

95
00:05:20,979 --> 00:05:24,570
I'm couple in kitchen tool that does

96
00:05:24,570 --> 00:05:28,380
that it that it does have are free or
open source so

97
00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:31,830
of course we shouldn't trust them and

98
00:05:31,830 --> 00:05:36,669
does have full disk encryption butter
the queues are stored on the phone

99
00:05:36,669 --> 00:05:40,919
and so is there fairly trivial matter
for forensic analyst

100
00:05:40,919 --> 00:05:45,659
or are anybody with Google research
skills

101
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:48,780
Ted figure out how to get that and had

102
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:52,720
to capture hard drive the good things
about it you can enable a stronger

103
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:55,770
screen lock on the Apple phone you can
actually enable a poll tax

104
00:05:55,770 --> 00:06:00,680
screen lock I and you came said it so
that if you enter the screen lock

105
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:04,060
wrong ten times that wiped the phone

106
00:06:04,060 --> 00:06:07,139
I'm so there's that you can have some a

107
00:06:07,139 --> 00:06:10,729
there's off-the-record chat which is a
chat secure

108
00:06:10,729 --> 00:06:14,568
and that works with any other atty are
quiet like pidgin OTR by

109
00:06:14,569 --> 00:06:18,240
arm this private GSM which is encoded
boys over IP

110
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:21,500
and that seems like a pretty good
solution for that and there is an

111
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:22,449
unofficial tour

112
00:06:22,449 --> 00:06:25,919
I haven't been able to ask any tore
folks what they think a bit but it's not

113
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:28,520
from that war project so

114
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:32,400
I had again I wouldn't trust it I and
there's less Mauer

115
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:35,960
this is just a there's less Mauer an
iPhone and there is an Android

116
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:42,960
so if you if mauer is a big concern for
you then maybe that's an advantage

117
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:46,669
arm

118
00:06:46,669 --> 00:06:50,400
schism and Ryan my opinion

119
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:55,110
is the best one for security it open
source there's lots of security tools

120
00:06:55,110 --> 00:06:56,449
lot of encryption tools

121
00:06:56,449 --> 00:07:00,949
there's strong screen lock and there's a
mating organizations behind

122
00:07:00,949 --> 00:07:04,220
Android like The Guardian project and
formerly with process

123
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:08,960
I am and so yeah I really think is the
best phone

124
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:11,970
book talk about threat models again

125
00:07:11,970 --> 00:07:16,180
so

126
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:19,400
currently in california and many other
states

127
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:22,919
and arresting officer can search her but
if it doesn't have a password lock on it

128
00:07:22,919 --> 00:07:26,060
or if you can get your password from you
I

129
00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:30,380
they can ribald refund this was decided
in the people versus the as case

130
00:07:30,380 --> 00:07:34,110
here I put your phone or here she can
rev up your phone and

131
00:07:34,110 --> 00:07:37,580
use any incriminating evidence against
you or against other people

132
00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:41,310
arm this has been tested

133
00:07:41,310 --> 00:07:45,500
in a few states and has held its been
attested in

134
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:48,550
a couple other states like Ohio and lost
so in Ohio

135
00:07:48,550 --> 00:07:51,630
for example I'm you cannot search

136
00:07:51,630 --> 00:07:55,370
a detainee is going on and currently in
New York

137
00:07:55,370 --> 00:08:01,680
it case why hasn't been tested yet as
far as I know so

138
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:05,180
water law enforcement investigators
looking for on

139
00:08:05,180 --> 00:08:08,280
and this is really in the case a
forensics or just a

140
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:12,120
officer on the street and you're in a
situation where being detained they're

141
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:15,389
looking forward to subscribe to an
equipment identifiers the unique

142
00:08:15,389 --> 00:08:19,360
ID that on your phone your list to
contact appointment calendars

143
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:23,860
photos maps where you've been and what
you're doing your text messages

144
00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:27,930
anything that could possibly be
incriminating another viewers for

145
00:08:27,930 --> 00:08:29,960
anything incriminating on your phones
right

146
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:34,000
so

147
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,469
it I'm

148
00:08:37,469 --> 00:08:41,880
yeah net so I but so the forensic
methods that the

149
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:47,200
is arm are they basically there the
general printing technique estimate for

150
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:49,209
those of you that don't know is to make

151
00:08:49,209 --> 00:08:52,810
a pristine down to the memory of your
phone

152
00:08:52,810 --> 00:08:56,550
and this can be done I accomplished in a
couple ways

153
00:08:56,550 --> 00:08:59,910
I with stopper forensics tools I

154
00:08:59,910 --> 00:09:03,800
by first recovering the screen lock
through

155
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:07,110
various methods either by a phone being

156
00:09:07,110 --> 00:09:10,589
on with Android debug bridge turned on
or

157
00:09:10,589 --> 00:09:15,100
by booting into recovery mode are and it
both those pale

158
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:18,990
there's something called J tag interface
which stands for joint test Action Group

159
00:09:18,990 --> 00:09:22,329
and this is a standard in all

160
00:09:22,329 --> 00:09:26,240
CB use that allows you to take apart the
phone

161
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:30,130
and solder a this little device to it
and it lets you

162
00:09:30,130 --> 00:09:34,209
armed created up with the memory this is
a

163
00:09:34,209 --> 00:09:37,760
possibly destructive acts so it's
possible that it could be ruled that

164
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:38,700
that made the

165
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:41,850
evidence forensically invalid but

166
00:09:41,850 --> 00:09:45,860
it's possible it could be anyway sewed
those are the forensic methods

167
00:09:45,860 --> 00:09:49,970
so what are the solutions here one is
having a strong screen lock in a short

168
00:09:49,970 --> 00:09:51,959
time out so that your screen lock is

169
00:09:51,959 --> 00:09:56,079
almost always on by the time an officer
gets to you so that they can just rival

170
00:09:56,079 --> 00:09:56,900
to your phone

171
00:09:56,900 --> 00:10:00,730
also turning off USB debugging super
important

172
00:10:00,730 --> 00:10:04,670
if you have USB debugging on anybody
with physical access to your phone

173
00:10:04,670 --> 00:10:08,390
has real on your phone if you have it on
your phone

174
00:10:08,390 --> 00:10:11,699
and if not then they can use every
exploit the you would you treat your

175
00:10:11,699 --> 00:10:12,720
phone and your phone

176
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:18,610
ok I turning USB debugging of makes
friends it a lot harder a lot of the

177
00:10:18,610 --> 00:10:19,250
forensics

178
00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:22,790
analysis documents that I read a lot a
presentation from the FBI that I read

179
00:10:22,790 --> 00:10:25,910
said they were like if we're if you
added

180
00:10:25,910 --> 00:10:29,640
if the personal ruin USB debugging
turned on then it's a piece a cake

181
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:32,790
if not I usage a tag so

182
00:10:32,790 --> 00:10:37,199
10 years beginning of to great way to
make friends it's a lot harder

183
00:10:37,199 --> 00:10:40,860
and obviously don't tell them your
password you don't have to tell a

184
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:44,130
I law enforcement officer anything other
than your name

185
00:10:44,130 --> 00:10:50,010
and address I think good

186
00:10:50,010 --> 00:10:53,270
I if it's rooted in you turn off the
debugger

187
00:10:53,270 --> 00:10:58,439
the problem then is recovery mod cuz
recovery mod can then be used to access

188
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:02,850
the ho love your phone as root unless
you have party being crafted

189
00:11:02,850 --> 00:11:08,079
arm which is why I said earlier somebody
does get physical access your phone you

190
00:11:08,079 --> 00:11:09,459
should consider compromised

191
00:11:09,459 --> 00:11:15,500
arm not

192
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:21,060
not not telling an officer your password
always hold that you'd a judge can

193
00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:22,910
compel you to know your password them

194
00:11:22,910 --> 00:11:27,280
I and thats that up to the judge in up
to you in your lawyer that you need to

195
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:28,069
talk about that

196
00:11:28,069 --> 00:11:32,760
I'm only saying don't talk to the police
on ok

197
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:35,939
that and yeah

198
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:39,920
head me in all cases your don't talk to
police

199
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:43,439
arm and encryption is a renegade I like

200
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:46,870
somebody out there was asking about if
they'd you know if you get into recovery

201
00:11:46,870 --> 00:11:47,170
mode

202
00:11:47,170 --> 00:11:51,430
well if you have part to be printed and
even ribbit then even bring into

203
00:11:51,430 --> 00:11:52,990
recovery mode

204
00:11:52,990 --> 00:11:56,010
won't be able to retrieve those parts

205
00:11:56,010 --> 00:12:00,920
so that's a really good thing today I'm

206
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:05,030
I some signal intersection I'm a beer
well I can see hands anymore

207
00:12:05,030 --> 00:12:11,250
abide by around eight o'clock I'm really
wrap it around talk today

208
00:12:11,250 --> 00:12:15,430
there was a really awesome cock I'm so
you obviously heard about all the crazy

209
00:12:15,430 --> 00:12:18,030
way the signal interception can have it
can happen with

210
00:12:18,030 --> 00:12:21,310
little crazy flying planes I am

211
00:12:21,310 --> 00:12:25,300
and you can you didn't build it yourself
with something called a US IP and again

212
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:26,730
the radio you can build

213
00:12:26,730 --> 00:12:31,709
your own GSM tower were I royal DSM
backpack essentially

214
00:12:31,709 --> 00:12:35,270
for less than a thousand dollars iron

215
00:12:35,270 --> 00:12:38,930
in addition to your drivers also
companies that offer this as a service

216
00:12:38,930 --> 00:12:40,589
to law enforcement agents

217
00:12:40,589 --> 00:12:45,030
arm and maybe two people that aren't law
enforcement agents as well

218
00:12:45,030 --> 00:12:50,079
I don't know iron and often cellular
companies were just provide

219
00:12:50,079 --> 00:12:55,380
wiretaps and location data a especially
location data and who was at a certain

220
00:12:55,380 --> 00:12:56,180
cell site

221
00:12:56,180 --> 00:12:59,819
without even work so

222
00:12:59,819 --> 00:13:04,089
what can we do about this I one thing we
can do is making printed phone calls

223
00:13:04,089 --> 00:13:07,860
using pitted Voice over IP or the RTP
protocol

224
00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:11,459
I with nothing using her to text
messages tech secure

225
00:13:11,459 --> 00:13:14,470
is a gated project for that

226
00:13:14,470 --> 00:13:17,810
or you can just talk in person your

227
00:13:17,810 --> 00:13:22,240
that read leave your phone at home even
on turn on the shower and go for a walk

228
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:27,150
that's a great way to have a
conversation

229
00:13:27,150 --> 00:13:30,780
when they think you're high-tech go
low-tech johnny mnemonic

230
00:13:30,780 --> 00:13:35,520
now ok

231
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:38,750
a gun so much I bought the stock is of
them

232
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:43,209
arm so screen lock this portends a
screen lock on Android

233
00:13:43,209 --> 00:13:48,220
their space unlock there's pattern pin
and password

234
00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:52,730
did did anybody are you the basic unlock

235
00:13:52,730 --> 00:13:58,770
okay good it but where's the phone can
be unlocked with the picture above you

236
00:13:58,770 --> 00:14:03,160
you can are now I think they fixed it so
you have to blink

237
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:07,990
I'm sure nobody can figure out a way
around there ok

238
00:14:07,990 --> 00:14:12,819
yeah many have an existential crisis
that's not good

239
00:14:12,819 --> 00:14:15,829
arm the pattern is not really much
better

240
00:14:15,829 --> 00:14:19,939
I Greece from your fingers leave the
pattern on the school leaves a trail in

241
00:14:19,939 --> 00:14:22,040
the pattern on the screen oftentimes

242
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:26,069
and there's a movie about 360,000
possible combinations which would be

243
00:14:26,069 --> 00:14:27,079
easy for a ride

244
00:14:27,079 --> 00:14:31,380
machine obviously to crack authorities
recast again a lot of people use right

245
00:14:31,380 --> 00:14:32,490
angles down the

246
00:14:32,490 --> 00:14:37,439
less I N bottom or right side and bottom
or there's a few very common ones

247
00:14:37,439 --> 00:14:40,790
that are used I and it's stored

248
00:14:40,790 --> 00:14:45,469
a without assault in the in the power
system attached but not thought it would

249
00:14:45,470 --> 00:14:46,980
be very easy to create a rainbow table

250
00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:50,800
if you wanna take crack it that way for
some reason I am

251
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:54,910
numeric pin is slightly better this
match attack can be mitigated by

252
00:14:54,910 --> 00:14:57,980
lack the arm by doubling up on numbers

253
00:14:57,980 --> 00:15:01,150
so you don't have any idea how many
times I pressed a certain number

254
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:05,939
arm and I not having only four numbers
in your PIN

255
00:15:05,939 --> 00:15:10,140
tend to the 16 possible combinations
with the longest possible pain

256
00:15:10,140 --> 00:15:13,180
so a bit better and then of course
password

257
00:15:13,180 --> 00:15:17,160
has the using every possible character
and affixing character password that

258
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:19,410
ended the thirty combinations

259
00:15:19,410 --> 00:15:24,219
I said you know thats that's a lot with
it that only the upper lower in numeric

260
00:15:24,220 --> 00:15:27,919
you have about 839 quadrillion possible
passwords

261
00:15:27,919 --> 00:15:32,750
which I don't have any sources for these
numbers other than that I swear to God I

262
00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:33,549
actually

263
00:15:33,549 --> 00:15:38,120
calculated this I him so your mileage
may vary but it would take a desktop

264
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:40,370
about six hundred forty seven thousand
is crack

265
00:15:40,370 --> 00:15:44,169
are or with a strong computer bit less
than a hundred

266
00:15:44,169 --> 00:15:49,100
or with an NSA computer probably i
connect sup

267
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:52,540
those are also stored hashed but they
also stored salted and they're stored in

268
00:15:52,540 --> 00:15:55,130
your data partition

269
00:15:55,130 --> 00:16:00,360
arm so to use a strong password and set
a password lock that's my advice

270
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:07,299
I'm you cannot get that if you don't
already have access the file system so

271
00:16:07,299 --> 00:16:11,150
yeah I'm I'm and ABS as to what may
retrieving the house would be but there

272
00:16:11,150 --> 00:16:12,230
is a big long

273
00:16:12,230 --> 00:16:15,490
friend that article on it and I found it
interesting

274
00:16:15,490 --> 00:16:18,929
ok I am

275
00:16:18,929 --> 00:16:22,290
and so everybody to an attacker can
circumvent your lock screen without

276
00:16:22,290 --> 00:16:24,020
having to get your password

277
00:16:24,020 --> 00:16:27,980
of course having a strong password is
used with so the ways to do that again

278
00:16:27,980 --> 00:16:32,569
are physical access to read it on with
USB debugging turned on

279
00:16:32,569 --> 00:16:37,770
I recovery mod I again if you get into
ClockworkMod and I don't know about the

280
00:16:37,770 --> 00:16:38,360
stock

281
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:42,730
recovery mad if this works too arm I'm
been able to test that but if you put

282
00:16:42,730 --> 00:16:44,020
into the earth

283
00:16:44,020 --> 00:16:49,589
you have access to the phone or again
urge a tag interface

284
00:16:49,589 --> 00:16:53,380
so the solutions are Jesus Christ to the
strongest remarks

285
00:16:53,380 --> 00:16:59,240
turn off USB debugging and use disk
encryption if you possibly can

286
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:03,079
I am if you've lost or stolen your phone
this is probably the one that we're

287
00:17:03,079 --> 00:17:05,110
almost in danger appear

288
00:17:05,110 --> 00:17:09,929
I there's up but have fun finding
applications and I

289
00:17:09,929 --> 00:17:14,329
absolute do remote wipe poison pill was
a good one it's recommended by the

290
00:17:14,329 --> 00:17:15,668
Guardian project

291
00:17:15,669 --> 00:17:20,040
Irish prey which is pardon me which is
cross-platform open-source

292
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:24,020
that's nice that broke out also does
this lookout Mobile Security

293
00:17:24,020 --> 00:17:28,349
is a anti-virus and remote wipe and they
seem like a pretty good good

294
00:17:28,349 --> 00:17:31,100
organization but again not open source

295
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:34,450
arm and some the card rate tracker which
I'd

296
00:17:34,450 --> 00:17:39,340
can remember what it is something about
it I am

297
00:17:39,340 --> 00:17:42,949
have a strong scream oxo that the
knucklehead you pick up your phone can't

298
00:17:42,950 --> 00:17:46,040
get it and but through pictures and

299
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:51,409
see your Pokemon porn or whatever I am

300
00:17:51,410 --> 00:17:56,059
up and reported to the provider not that
don't necessarily give a shit

301
00:17:56,059 --> 00:17:59,350
but a for a for a long time AT&T won't
even

302
00:17:59,350 --> 00:18:03,168
I am another company 20 min blacklisting
the

303
00:18:03,169 --> 00:18:07,440
E the IMEI the men in black with black
Mustang the serial numbers or stolen

304
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:08,020
phones

305
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:11,490
so you can just go reactivate it
somewhere else because it is in there

306
00:18:11,490 --> 00:18:16,179
financial interest and new customers and
make them sign new contract

307
00:18:16,179 --> 00:18:19,620
from our I there is the

308
00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:22,890
there have been a couple talked about an
hour this console I won't go

309
00:18:22,890 --> 00:18:28,750
too deeply into this arm but as a nerd
Carrier IQ

310
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:33,049
yeah okay so they made after the data
they made spyware

311
00:18:33,049 --> 00:18:37,049
that wears on practically every Android
phone and who put it there the phone

312
00:18:37,049 --> 00:18:38,090
companies

313
00:18:38,090 --> 00:18:41,959
a every phone company basically will
inspire that what was

314
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:45,380
spyware but it was a rootkit and what it
did was

315
00:18:45,380 --> 00:18:50,340
send every keystroke back to Carrier IQ
it sent every website you visited back

316
00:18:50,340 --> 00:18:51,750
to Carrier IQ

317
00:18:51,750 --> 00:18:54,950
and I think that some other stuff too so
it was

318
00:18:54,950 --> 00:18:58,160
with the UK that the phone companies
tortured you to put on there because

319
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:00,410
carriers use business model was will
give you

320
00:19:00,410 --> 00:19:04,299
deep analytics on how people are using
your phone's

321
00:19:04,299 --> 00:19:09,129
I and so researcher discovered it and
they were very pissed about that

322
00:19:09,130 --> 00:19:14,650
he published the a packages and all the
documentation he had on

323
00:19:14,650 --> 00:19:18,750
at the publishing Ars Technica and
Carrier IQ was pissed

324
00:19:18,750 --> 00:19:21,860
they sent in DMZ a letter they sent a
takedown notices

325
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:25,260
they weird calling him and threatening
him and then of course

326
00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:28,299
everybody heard about it and I got a lot
of media attention

327
00:19:28,299 --> 00:19:32,220
and Carrier IQ said group nevermind
that's okay

328
00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:35,030
we're just append the company and you
can leave that out we don't mind if we

329
00:19:35,030 --> 00:19:37,120
have nothing to hide

330
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:41,760
anymore your

331
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:45,440
I so there's about him back a ride two
detectors out there

332
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:49,490
on and I'm

333
00:19:49,490 --> 00:19:53,080
had the name one of them in a don't have
it anymore so

334
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:56,178
I and there's I mean there's all sorts
of other

335
00:19:56,179 --> 00:19:59,760
bloatware and spyware and just really
the usual suspects

336
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:04,000
that we see in malware anything spyware
trojans

337
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,760
phishing attacks arm

338
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:12,169
you know bank fraud basically everything
you really expect to see in malware on

339
00:20:12,169 --> 00:20:13,220
your computer

340
00:20:13,220 --> 00:20:16,230
also a exists on the phone now

341
00:20:16,230 --> 00:20:19,630
I and of course a the Facebook app

342
00:20:19,630 --> 00:20:26,630
is a just a giant spyware after highly
recommend you don't install that

343
00:20:26,660 --> 00:20:29,870
so are how can we prevent an hour the
first

344
00:20:29,870 --> 00:20:33,240
thing is I hadn't don't download random
shit

345
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:36,610
ok don't you know I am

346
00:20:36,610 --> 00:20:40,650
other than I after I don't be spared
party app stores

347
00:20:40,650 --> 00:20:44,090
on and you know it

348
00:20:44,090 --> 00:20:47,590
by your friend send you a text message
with an AP K attached maybe don't

349
00:20:47,590 --> 00:20:49,039
install it

350
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:52,090
and you know done in stopping of a
download sites just

351
00:20:52,090 --> 00:20:55,240
be careful what you install and of
course you can also use anti-virus like

352
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:56,530
look out or something else

353
00:20:56,530 --> 00:20:59,340
there's no open first antivirus
unfortunately so I guess I'll have to

354
00:20:59,340 --> 00:21:00,860
record recommend lookout

355
00:21:00,860 --> 00:21:03,890
a because respected colleague does work
there

356
00:21:03,890 --> 00:21:07,580
and he says that there are right so you
can take it on my word that this guy's

357
00:21:07,580 --> 00:21:08,418
cool

358
00:21:08,419 --> 00:21:13,030
and ok I N

359
00:21:13,030 --> 00:21:16,860
and I you causing his permission
selection aP's permissions tonight is a

360
00:21:16,860 --> 00:21:20,190
good one that basically allow it but to
you

361
00:21:20,190 --> 00:21:25,590
with article Tom let you select what
permissions the app hasn't course this

362
00:21:25,590 --> 00:21:28,299
can cause all sorts of weird things
happen to an app

363
00:21:28,299 --> 00:21:31,190
if it doesn't have the permissions
expects an app developers haven't

364
00:21:31,190 --> 00:21:33,049
written in exceptions for that

365
00:21:33,049 --> 00:21:36,520
arm but then maybe you know that this

366
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:40,900
the you met me know maybe maybe have

367
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:44,220
maybe Need for Speed who doesn't need a
list by your contacts and I'm

368
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:50,120
I am adamkus installing CyanogenMod
bring a poner installing any other mod

369
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:51,210
or installing just

370
00:21:51,210 --> 00:21:54,510
vanilla Android kids again later remove
bloatware

371
00:21:54,510 --> 00:22:01,390
and carrier installed spyware and things
like that

372
00:22:01,390 --> 00:22:04,570
I am but even a nap with no permissions
can do a lot

373
00:22:04,570 --> 00:22:07,740
I there was a in study by

374
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:10,840
some and raid a security researcher is

375
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:14,860
name again escapes me I where they he
created an app

376
00:22:14,860 --> 00:22:18,490
with 0 permissions just to see what you
can get

377
00:22:18,490 --> 00:22:22,929
and from a nap in their permissions you
can read all the files on the SD card

378
00:22:22,929 --> 00:22:26,640
you can get a list of all the packages
that are installed on the phone

379
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:29,890
you can access if any I ap

380
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:33,539
any application files that have poorly
set permissions their

381
00:22:33,539 --> 00:22:37,620
world readable permission are you can
read those or the world right away you

382
00:22:37,620 --> 00:22:38,820
can write to him

383
00:22:38,820 --> 00:22:42,059
arm and this is more common than you'd
expect

384
00:22:42,059 --> 00:22:46,210
you can read I G Smit is insane vendor
ID's

385
00:22:46,210 --> 00:22:50,809
UK in read and write a review which is
an ID that's unique to your phones you

386
00:22:50,809 --> 00:22:51,320
can new

387
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:54,510
you could uniquely identify a person
possibly that way

388
00:22:54,510 --> 00:22:58,850
and you can call home with all this
information by opening up a browser and

389
00:22:58,850 --> 00:23:00,990
sending a GET request to a page

390
00:23:00,990 --> 00:23:05,000
well with your permission so you can
really do a lot with

391
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:09,039
nothing here

392
00:23:09,039 --> 00:23:15,549
their I you don't need internet access
permission to open up a browser intent

393
00:23:15,549 --> 00:23:19,870
with the URL stated opening up a browser
and passing a URL

394
00:23:19,870 --> 00:23:23,640
and hopefully the person doesn't notice
their browsers opening report purport on

395
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:25,140
there so they don't care

396
00:23:25,140 --> 00:23:30,010
ok order games

397
00:23:30,010 --> 00:23:33,620
I'm exactly

398
00:23:33,620 --> 00:23:36,789
so yeah I'm

399
00:23:36,789 --> 00:23:40,210
I am and other attacks the unique to the
bone

400
00:23:40,210 --> 00:23:43,870
I if you have an NFC chip leader I just
discovered this today and was

401
00:23:43,870 --> 00:23:49,140
really freaked out an NFC chip can open
up a browser without asking you hadn't

402
00:23:49,140 --> 00:23:50,780
paid so I was reading an

403
00:23:50,780 --> 00:23:54,180
when the HAC lab appear had a NFC chip
with the

404
00:23:54,180 --> 00:23:57,970
tropez guy on it that says can be
furloughed and of course I was like okay

405
00:23:57,970 --> 00:24:01,200
that sounds like a great idea

406
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:04,620
so I scanned it and it immediately open
a browser window and started loading a

407
00:24:04,620 --> 00:24:07,500
page at which point immediately pull my
battery

408
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:13,020
ok and so the lesson here is be careful
what you scan

409
00:24:13,020 --> 00:24:16,560
I apparently NFC can open a browser
without even asking your permission I

410
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:18,159
did not know that

411
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:22,080
arm and I'm another possible attack

412
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:25,270
is bolted the NFC you can trigger an
attack intent

413
00:24:25,270 --> 00:24:28,270
which opens up the rather I mean it's
not every

414
00:24:28,270 --> 00:24:31,440
I'm and QR code fishing

415
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:34,940
a what if somebody were to good

416
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:38,230
a QR code on all the bank america the

417
00:24:38,230 --> 00:24:42,890
subway ads that lead you to a
bankamerica phishing site

418
00:24:42,890 --> 00:24:46,230
or what if you're the Yes Men and you
put a

419
00:24:46,230 --> 00:24:49,960
QR ads on all the a Chevron billboards

420
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:53,290
that led you to air share on trough I'd

421
00:24:53,290 --> 00:24:56,210
so there's some there's some cool things
that can be done they're actually need

422
00:24:56,210 --> 00:24:58,910
really like to see somebody research
this

423
00:24:58,910 --> 00:25:02,870
arm

424
00:25:02,870 --> 00:25:06,540
7 talking a lot about encryption animal
to talk a little bit more about it

425
00:25:06,540 --> 00:25:10,030
so and it has some up all this
convection built-in

426
00:25:10,030 --> 00:25:13,160
arsons Android 3 Honeycomb

427
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:16,340
and good

428
00:25:16,340 --> 00:25:20,290
does anybody know we'll get some
embroidery on tablet Android for on the

429
00:25:20,290 --> 00:25:22,290
phone it's an Ice Cream Sandwich as well

430
00:25:22,290 --> 00:25:26,620
I am does anybody here is anybody on the
Google Android team

431
00:25:26,620 --> 00:25:31,520
got back in bone to pick with your

432
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:36,520
Bay really screwed up for this
contraption so I'm glad it's better

433
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:39,700
I shouldn't say for this conviction it's
not full description

434
00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:43,170
encrypt the data partition and

435
00:25:43,170 --> 00:25:46,450
sometimes been perhaps the SD card
partitioned

436
00:25:46,450 --> 00:25:49,610
will only sometimes it gets the data
partition a lot about that actually just

437
00:25:49,610 --> 00:25:51,340
doesn't even work

438
00:25:51,340 --> 00:25:55,110
arm but on the front it does work on my
burning impacted the SD card

439
00:25:55,110 --> 00:25:58,540
on other people's phone is not so your
mileage may vary as to whether

440
00:25:58,540 --> 00:26:00,490
temperature phone at all

441
00:26:00,490 --> 00:26:05,620
and he's a DM kept that a good thing
that's the tried and true method a

442
00:26:05,620 --> 00:26:10,560
in getting a.m. spread the infection
process for a one hr drive

443
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:14,629
arm so we know that this is
cryptographically secure

444
00:26:14,630 --> 00:26:18,010
but the worst part is that uses your
lock screen

445
00:26:18,010 --> 00:26:22,000
as the encryption key uses your lock
screen password adding captions d

446
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:26,170
so you have really complicated but
screen were really should be hard disk

447
00:26:26,170 --> 00:26:28,420
encryption password

448
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:32,070
is not a good balance nobody wants to
pull out the boat in and sit there for

449
00:26:32,070 --> 00:26:32,429
many

450
00:26:32,430 --> 00:26:37,160
entering their lock screen password but
also if you have a four digit PIN for

451
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:38,610
your disk encryption

452
00:26:38,610 --> 00:26:42,900
well you might as well not even have a
description

453
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:45,980
so what are some other options well

454
00:26:45,980 --> 00:26:49,880
there was with brick or until 12 on it
and now there's no more think such

455
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:52,630
things with brickwork

456
00:26:52,630 --> 00:26:56,150
I trigger there's a triggered a
container

457
00:26:56,150 --> 00:27:01,510
a application Concord tonight which will
create and read and write to tryptic

458
00:27:01,510 --> 00:27:02,910
TrueCrypt containers

459
00:27:02,910 --> 00:27:07,280
so you could you there on your SD card
but not on year

460
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:13,149
not on your power system II and there's
also likes manager which is lax which

461
00:27:13,150 --> 00:27:14,260
can create much containers

462
00:27:14,260 --> 00:27:17,740
which locks is that the other part of
the system that

463
00:27:17,740 --> 00:27:24,740
does hard disk encryption for the Knicks
I actually think

464
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:31,200
and so locks can also be used to encrypt
your SD card I am

465
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:33,530
and there's something called Biosci for
this is again being written by the

466
00:27:33,530 --> 00:27:34,410
Guardian project

467
00:27:34,410 --> 00:27:38,490
it's for dads still in Alpha but
basically what it does is it allows you

468
00:27:38,490 --> 00:27:41,440
to create an encrypted virtual file
system for your app

469
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:46,540
so I your app get it on bass estimates
toward completing greeted with a

470
00:27:46,540 --> 00:27:48,330
password that the user has to enter

471
00:27:48,330 --> 00:27:52,460
and then when the app is done the file
system goes back to being accepted

472
00:27:52,460 --> 00:27:55,700
so even if you don't have a description
you can at least encrypt

473
00:27:55,700 --> 00:27:59,110
the space the rap Brendan so that's
going to be pretty cool

474
00:27:59,110 --> 00:28:02,540
and what about congress in

475
00:28:02,540 --> 00:28:06,250
I I'm OST n

476
00:28:06,250 --> 00:28:10,430
I is the a project by OS held on me

477
00:28:10,430 --> 00:28:14,500
these are a about two people have been
doing a lot I really cool work

478
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:18,000
in the angrier very much I'm ir

479
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:21,810
in the encryption and Android security i

480
00:28:21,810 --> 00:28:27,690
field so it stands for opens secure
source or standards telephoning network

481
00:28:27,690 --> 00:28:31,190
and it uses the RTP which is a

482
00:28:31,190 --> 00:28:34,250
protocol that fill them in the inventor
PDP invented

483
00:28:34,250 --> 00:28:37,270
and it's the it's a protocol

484
00:28:37,270 --> 00:28:41,700
for and and the encryption a Voice over
IP

485
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:46,670
the goal by seán estaba federated
network with no central authority very

486
00:28:46,670 --> 00:28:47,870
similar to jabber

487
00:28:47,870 --> 00:28:52,490
arm and you get a real phone number
which is something like

488
00:28:52,490 --> 00:28:56,100
3 12 at I was told at me arm

489
00:28:56,100 --> 00:29:02,240
and I they have a client base of a/c Sep
simple which is the gold standard for

490
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:03,780
Voice over IP for Android

491
00:29:03,780 --> 00:29:08,420
open source and it's great are but also
it works with their own client which is

492
00:29:08,420 --> 00:29:09,400
called OS tell

493
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:13,330
and works with a clinical private GSN

494
00:29:13,330 --> 00:29:16,620
which runs on Android iPhone and even
blackberry

495
00:29:16,620 --> 00:29:19,020
so you can have incurred to
conversations with all your friends

496
00:29:19,020 --> 00:29:20,150
which is great

497
00:29:20,150 --> 00:29:23,890
for definitely check out I was told on
me and if you want my

498
00:29:23,890 --> 00:29:26,970
point phone number for recorded phone
call later

499
00:29:26,970 --> 00:29:30,470
and give that to you and

500
00:29:30,470 --> 00:29:33,910
I don't know why you would want to copy
paste I am

501
00:29:33,910 --> 00:29:38,220
what about other caption Jeffrey but
this fantastic

502
00:29:38,220 --> 00:29:42,260
a everybody knows where it does anybody
not know what of a record net

503
00:29:42,260 --> 00:29:46,650
chat is not in the sense that Google not
liking it but actually impacted

504
00:29:46,650 --> 00:29:51,970
LTR okay get so divided the otro
application for Android

505
00:29:51,970 --> 00:29:55,230
fantastic you should definitely install
it a PG

506
00:29:55,230 --> 00:30:00,240
is the pgp application for Android I
don't feel great about having

507
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:03,870
and PGP key private keys stored on my
phone

508
00:30:03,870 --> 00:30:08,270
but a there are some solutions that like
having a master key in on restoring a

509
00:30:08,270 --> 00:30:09,780
temporary key on your phone

510
00:30:09,780 --> 00:30:13,860
on nor by and/or web

511
00:30:13,860 --> 00:30:16,990
which aired not encryption but anonymity

512
00:30:16,990 --> 00:30:20,950
this is tricked or for Android I'll or
bot is the door

513
00:30:20,950 --> 00:30:24,870
a.m. North software on Android and then
or Web

514
00:30:24,870 --> 00:30:28,330
is tor browser and it has

515
00:30:28,330 --> 00:30:31,720
Open VPN so you can have your data
partition

516
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:34,900
a retainer data partition unity 3d
connexion

517
00:30:34,900 --> 00:30:39,800
or forty incurred it all the time
arguing over a virtual private network

518
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:40,710
which is really nice

519
00:30:40,710 --> 00:30:44,490
and were doing except it makes it slower

520
00:30:44,490 --> 00:30:48,660
and most people there mostly the time is
already pretty swell

521
00:30:48,660 --> 00:30:54,840
especially here for some reason on and

522
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:57,840
you had been something to keep in mind
is that Open VPN

523
00:30:57,840 --> 00:31:01,030
encrypt your data connection but it
doesn't hurt your voice connection so

524
00:31:01,030 --> 00:31:03,240
this is not a replacement for using

525
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:06,970
OS towers the RGP I add

526
00:31:06,970 --> 00:31:10,170
somebody could still interceptor your
phone call or drop you down to two do

527
00:31:10,170 --> 00:31:10,520
you

528
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:13,700
an intercepted phone call that way I
there's no

529
00:31:13,700 --> 00:31:18,610
cyber which is based off a sequel saver
which is a library written to you

530
00:31:18,610 --> 00:31:21,910
a store guarded people like databases

531
00:31:21,910 --> 00:31:25,040
on and then there's tech secure which

532
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:28,950
was written by was process but is the
only product that survived outta there

533
00:31:28,950 --> 00:31:33,690
and which is now open source and its end
to end in pretty text messaging

534
00:31:33,690 --> 00:31:39,380
in a fashion similar to go to your and
this could talk at which is

535
00:31:39,380 --> 00:31:43,160
the multi the party chat and this is Ed

536
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:46,260
out there it's an offer right now for
Android it's still kinda buggy

537
00:31:46,260 --> 00:31:50,080
but on on the web it's awesome and I'm
sure to get off my mind right here

538
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:53,409
they may go to that because I can't talk
this morning

539
00:31:53,410 --> 00:31:58,820
yeah as Tiger arm

540
00:31:58,820 --> 00:32:04,320
somalis flaps are time

541
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:07,790
bad doctor go as an alternative search
provider

542
00:32:07,790 --> 00:32:11,500
some than other results probably aren't
as good as you go but they don't

543
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:15,160
they say they don't like your IP address
and they definitely don't but all your

544
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:15,970
search results

545
00:32:15,970 --> 00:32:19,550
I so they do so the same result
everybody which is kinda nice

546
00:32:19,550 --> 00:32:22,800
other ski pass which is a great

547
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:26,330
password storage and supper

548
00:32:26,330 --> 00:32:29,389
that runs on pretty much every platform
there s

549
00:32:29,390 --> 00:32:33,210
there's at a way which is this thing's
court like Adblock Plus

550
00:32:33,210 --> 00:32:37,780
said but for your entire phone solo
block ads for every application you have

551
00:32:37,780 --> 00:32:42,160
and how does this is by putting Ubuntu
entries in your hosts file

552
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:45,260
but it is open source and you can go
look at that hosts file

553
00:32:45,260 --> 00:32:48,810
and make sure that they're not doing
anything shady

554
00:32:48,810 --> 00:32:51,840
I am there's after i'd after it is great
at a rate

555
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:55,660
is an alternative Android Market it's
the only one I recommend you use

556
00:32:55,660 --> 00:32:58,940
I they have only open source software

557
00:32:58,940 --> 00:33:03,770
a either with the the GPR or Apache

558
00:33:03,770 --> 00:33:07,560
our other open source licenses and you
can set up your own

559
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:11,889
a repositories much like Debian

560
00:33:11,890 --> 00:33:15,020
so after it is really great I try to
install as much tougher of the

561
00:33:15,020 --> 00:33:18,900
as possible it's not always up to date
with the Play Store

562
00:33:18,900 --> 00:33:24,130
arm but that's okay

563
00:33:24,130 --> 00:33:27,860
sometimes we sacrifice usability I
obscure can

564
00:33:27,860 --> 00:33:31,600
is a an app that lets you blur out
people's faces

565
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:35,520
in pictures and videos upload them or
even redact them entirely

566
00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:39,639
so if you had a protest or other a

567
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:42,550
or if you're taking pictures of somebody
whether doing something illegal you can

568
00:33:42,550 --> 00:33:43,960
wear out their bases

569
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:48,940
and then even if somebody like a live
person aged to see those pictures

570
00:33:48,940 --> 00:33:52,630
they can't there's nothing really
terminating their I read the demeanor is

571
00:33:52,630 --> 00:33:55,730
incriminating things but don't have a
much harder time actually

572
00:33:55,730 --> 00:33:59,360
prosecuting somebody for that CA cert
manager

573
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:03,290
that see you a revoke or install

574
00:34:03,290 --> 00:34:06,620
new root certificates or offers
certificates that you don't want to

575
00:34:06,620 --> 00:34:08,020
trust Go Daddy

576
00:34:08,020 --> 00:34:11,150
a and their SSL certificate for example

577
00:34:11,150 --> 00:34:15,060
you can remove that as Firefox

578
00:34:15,060 --> 00:34:18,120
and I P table blog is pretty great let's

579
00:34:18,120 --> 00:34:21,989
its makes a lot about the traffic going
in and out over your system

580
00:34:21,990 --> 00:34:26,550
so if you do have malware on there this
is a good way to find out about it

581
00:34:26,550 --> 00:34:30,230
other shark which is why a shark or a
packet logging application again another

582
00:34:30,230 --> 00:34:31,210
way to

583
00:34:31,210 --> 00:34:35,010
I inspect all the packets and network
packets that are going in and out of

584
00:34:35,010 --> 00:34:36,240
your phone

585
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:39,980
and a large cap which but you read and
runs large

586
00:34:39,980 --> 00:34:43,668
so these are ways you can do I'm there
are ways you can

587
00:34:43,668 --> 00:34:47,620
pen tester and phone and I recommend
auditing your own phone

588
00:34:47,620 --> 00:34:52,080
when you go home or you know when your
backyard or in tonight see if you can

589
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:54,830
break into your phone without knowing
your screen lock password

590
00:34:54,830 --> 00:34:57,970
plugin and you have a DB turned on or
there was a

591
00:34:57,970 --> 00:35:01,670
said talk on Friday I from then entered
penetration

592
00:35:01,670 --> 00:35:05,170
I'm worker and red penetration testing
framework now

593
00:35:05,170 --> 00:35:10,690
so take that home run out on the fun and
see what happens

594
00:35:10,690 --> 00:35:13,830
I have to recommend ordering your own
phone it's really fine it's a good way

595
00:35:13,830 --> 00:35:16,690
to you find out about vulnerabilities

596
00:35:16,690 --> 00:35:20,140
and then switch phones with a friend not
at their phone and have them on your

597
00:35:20,140 --> 00:35:23,890
phone

598
00:35:23,890 --> 00:35:27,379
so in conclusion again turn up USB
debugging

599
00:35:27,380 --> 00:35:31,330
do it leavitt are once you turn it back
on for some reason turn it back off

600
00:35:31,330 --> 00:35:33,080
again

601
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:37,200
keep your phone on you at all times damn
don't leave it placed fifth

602
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:41,080
this is really easy and it's you know to
keep it in your pocket

603
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:45,480
don't get drunk and leave it at the bar

604
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:49,120
at I speak from experience

605
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:52,210
trust what you install you know don't
over in

606
00:35:52,210 --> 00:35:56,790
don't run random packages and you don't
know what they contain

607
00:35:56,790 --> 00:36:00,279
open source is awesome if you can read
the source code or if you can

608
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:03,570
if you have a friend there industry that
the source code is okay then that's

609
00:36:03,570 --> 00:36:04,320
awesome

610
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:08,660
and you'll be much more secure I
honestly do you recommend rooting and

611
00:36:08,660 --> 00:36:10,350
installing CyanogenMod

612
00:36:10,350 --> 00:36:14,850
there are there are some downsides to
reading

613
00:36:14,850 --> 00:36:18,140
in that it's possible for than for
summary to get real access to your phone

614
00:36:18,140 --> 00:36:22,160
but I think that there's the advantages
far outweigh the downsides

615
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:25,660
I'm in the types and encryption app you
can install

616
00:36:25,660 --> 00:36:29,940
and the number either really awesome
features you can get from rooted phone

617
00:36:29,940 --> 00:36:33,050
and having Sandidge in mind is really
nice

618
00:36:33,050 --> 00:36:37,330
I am your strongest remarks are your
phone and encrypt everything you

619
00:36:37,330 --> 00:36:40,049
possibly can because encryption is your
last

620
00:36:40,050 --> 00:36:43,250
and strongest lineup defense here

621
00:36:43,250 --> 00:36:48,620
so that it this presentations online it
on get home

622
00:36:48,620 --> 00:36:53,990
this is a QR code race where goes to get
have

623
00:36:53,990 --> 00:36:57,540
I don't know why you wouldn't believe me
share we've known each other for years

624
00:36:57,540 --> 00:37:04,110
I'm ir and add there's a button
resources on there and other things

625
00:37:04,110 --> 00:37:11,110
arm and I say about an everyday for you
are cuz it really is safe to scan this

626
00:37:13,100 --> 00:37:16,870
I could that's true maybe my
presentation is a rigid it is

627
00:37:16,870 --> 00:37:20,100
a PDF file third run as PDF file its
fine

628
00:37:20,100 --> 00:37:23,210
up

629
00:37:23,210 --> 00:37:26,880
your him

630
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:31,430
that be telling him at I'm yeah thanks a
lot

631
00:37:31,430 --> 00:37:36,370
that our yeah I think right again my
name is Cooper

632
00:37:36,370 --> 00:37:40,650
I am these waves can get in contact with
me on Twitter or on jabber

633
00:37:40,650 --> 00:37:43,920
Myer Dr PGP keys are there

634
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:50,920
and region thank you very much I and one
more thing before I got a question

635
00:37:52,330 --> 00:37:56,290
all the way back I am coordinator

636
00:37:56,290 --> 00:38:00,690
the an event called hackney which is an
unconference that we do

637
00:38:00,690 --> 00:38:04,470
a we're trying to do every year in San
Francisco the next one is happening

638
00:38:04,470 --> 00:38:06,820
October 19th thru 21st

639
00:38:06,820 --> 00:38:10,560
are many your hackneyed outward to find
out more information

640
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:14,020
I am in its record in conference and we
talk about a

641
00:38:14,020 --> 00:38:17,850
in a lot of things that are interesting
the hackers an activist

642
00:38:17,850 --> 00:38:21,029
we do it the no israeli hackers based in
San Francisco

643
00:38:21,030 --> 00:38:24,000
I thought I definitely recommend you
check it out and maybe some meritocracy

644
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,990
is coming out more simple stuff

645
00:38:25,990 --> 00:38:29,450
and meet some people so I thank you very
much

646
00:38:29,450 --> 00:38:33,210
for coming out I'll take some questions
as: marketing intern at the

647
00:38:33,210 --> 00:38:40,210
on

648
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:45,750
so I just want to know it's my
understanding that

649
00:38:45,750 --> 00:38:52,020
with the mom a race you dated if you
fill log in 10 times feature on my phone

650
00:38:52,020 --> 00:38:56,970
is that if you go through like a
connector in the piano student Lauren

651
00:38:56,970 --> 00:39:01,240
it will not trigger the erasure if you
do 10-run passwords

652
00:39:01,240 --> 00:39:06,190
so you can as with that and within two
hours cracking me for Japan

653
00:39:06,190 --> 00:39:11,430
add I I mean it that's right and I i
mean i i don't know anything about I

654
00:39:11,430 --> 00:39:12,180
really so

655
00:39:12,180 --> 00:39:17,060
your that's good to know in I again is
just another nail in the coffin for

656
00:39:17,060 --> 00:39:17,700
iPhone

657
00:39:17,700 --> 00:39:21,790
related your to two questions one is

658
00:39:21,790 --> 00:39:24,990
what might be a way to deactivate the
microphone

659
00:39:24,990 --> 00:39:30,760
you detected some app is has a open or
block it from being open

660
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:35,140
I turn off your to take the battery out

661
00:39:35,140 --> 00:39:39,040
I mean honestly Saar somebody has a rich
kid on your phone

662
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:44,550
UN that kid the inject into any library
the will be using to detect the

663
00:39:44,550 --> 00:39:46,100
microphone being turned on

664
00:39:46,100 --> 00:39:49,650
and override that so honestly I think
the only way

665
00:39:49,650 --> 00:39:52,820
that I can guarantee you that your
microphone is not on as if you take the

666
00:39:52,820 --> 00:39:54,420
battery on your phone

667
00:39:54,420 --> 00:39:59,370
okay and then you mention that the
encryption is based on your password

668
00:39:59,370 --> 00:40:03,450
your serve you change the password you
actually sit there while it

669
00:40:03,450 --> 00:40:06,770
unencrypted everything in rem crips
everything no so

670
00:40:06,770 --> 00:40:10,500
the way it actually works is your
password is the

671
00:40:10,500 --> 00:40:13,860
achieve for were a storage container
yeah

672
00:40:13,860 --> 00:40:17,790
it to keep or the key in the queue for
storage okay the world armed men in a

673
00:40:17,790 --> 00:40:19,029
little more detail that hurts

674
00:40:19,030 --> 00:40:22,980
your password is actually a key for
storage container restores the actual

675
00:40:22,980 --> 00:40:24,230
full disk encryption key

676
00:40:24,230 --> 00:40:27,250
so you do you change your screen my
password that said

677
00:40:27,250 --> 00:40:31,590
really quick process because it's only
re in creating a very small file

678
00:40:31,590 --> 00:40:34,990
but another caveat about encryption

679
00:40:34,990 --> 00:40:39,130
is that once you do encrypt your phone
you can go back to you can't uncredited

680
00:40:39,130 --> 00:40:42,910
that would defeat the purpose so if you
wanna

681
00:40:42,910 --> 00:40:46,549
upgrade or reinstall your OS you do have
to wipe everything

682
00:40:46,550 --> 00:40:50,580
on American W over-the-air update I
don't know

683
00:40:50,580 --> 00:40:55,170
than anybody know taken do over-the-air
updates was starving the kurds drive

684
00:40:55,170 --> 00:40:58,330
I don't know about that so your mileage
may vary their

685
00:40:58,330 --> 00:41:02,730
do you have any information about
hardware forensic devices like the data

686
00:41:02,730 --> 00:41:07,300
servers and other things you can connect
to the phone to download stayed on Mac

687
00:41:07,300 --> 00:41:10,810
with a claim they can work around a lot
of these restrictions

688
00:41:10,810 --> 00:41:14,350
I I mean I think that they work I don't

689
00:41:14,350 --> 00:41:17,910
I if I had to guess I would say that
they probably work around a lot of these

690
00:41:17,910 --> 00:41:19,690
restrictions in the same ways

691
00:41:19,690 --> 00:41:24,400
that attackers were just in automated
way so they'll probably try to reboot

692
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:27,430
into recovery mode or see if you have a
BB

693
00:41:27,430 --> 00:41:31,620
turned on that would be my guess

694
00:41:31,620 --> 00:41:35,480
but there are other a little bit ago
going will get you a long way I found a

695
00:41:35,480 --> 00:41:36,570
time

696
00:41:36,570 --> 00:41:40,860
the Piazza presentations from law
enforcement government is

697
00:41:40,860 --> 00:41:44,230
about how they're trying to do you
forensics

698
00:41:44,230 --> 00:41:48,480
on I on smartphones and what are the
best ways to do that and they actually

699
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:49,820
seem really

700
00:41:49,820 --> 00:41:53,590
like they have not figured out where the
general said it best practices for had a

701
00:41:53,590 --> 00:41:55,700
different take on these guys are so many
ways

702
00:41:55,700 --> 00:41:58,940
the data can be altered I'm after they
get it

703
00:41:58,940 --> 00:42:03,200
even that cancel a question you
mentioned you are your own phone

704
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:06,840
ya been thinking with a little luck on

705
00:42:06,840 --> 00:42:10,050
what what what is in fact on your your

706
00:42:10,050 --> 00:42:13,460
the is a really can goes we're in
Chickasha values for

707
00:42:13,460 --> 00:42:16,780
prison resources a minute we've done is
another opening seasons but I mean

708
00:42:16,780 --> 00:42:19,860
it was only these dang phones around the
not being updated

709
00:42:19,860 --> 00:42:22,990
yeah the the operating systems are now
going so orders on different versions or

710
00:42:22,990 --> 00:42:23,820
take

711
00:42:23,820 --> 00:42:27,010
you kit kit is a repository for these
things we know

712
00:42:27,010 --> 00:42:30,430
your is our collection I've you're known
bad now where that's been reversed out

713
00:42:30,430 --> 00:42:32,129
there yet because they're

714
00:42:32,130 --> 00:42:35,890
there was one go to start yeah just
check your own stuff

715
00:42:35,890 --> 00:42:41,089
question home I mean as far as
collections have now where they're out

716
00:42:41,090 --> 00:42:41,680
there

717
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:45,839
them there's a a couple there's a couple
a forensics blogs

718
00:42:45,840 --> 00:42:49,410
that list a lot of them our Tom and

719
00:42:49,410 --> 00:42:53,129
you know I think that places like me
happy and no doubt definitely have the

720
00:42:53,130 --> 00:42:54,170
short term

721
00:42:54,170 --> 00:42:57,670
the databases the ball there about
working there in a very good position to

722
00:42:57,670 --> 00:42:59,140
get that sort of thing

723
00:42:59,140 --> 00:43:02,700
whether they'll release that to you is
pretty unlikely

724
00:43:02,700 --> 00:43:06,780
I but as far as a central repository of
those I don't think there does nothing

725
00:43:06,780 --> 00:43:08,050
like that i've seen

726
00:43:08,050 --> 00:43:11,900
amply be great if there was one and then

727
00:43:11,900 --> 00:43:16,390
you had a second part to that question
but I'd it again for governor weld

728
00:43:16,390 --> 00:43:19,400
nickens slick there any yet

729
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:23,110
out right right so I am

730
00:43:23,110 --> 00:43:25,710
I think I mean I think just here this
weekend we've seen the first to offer

731
00:43:25,710 --> 00:43:27,340
that which is the

732
00:43:27,340 --> 00:43:31,170
Android penetration testing zapper and
that that seems like I

733
00:43:31,170 --> 00:43:35,330
a good way to go about honoring your
phone in a more automated fashion

734
00:43:35,330 --> 00:43:40,259
right now your yeah shapiro's Men in
Black Hand I don't remember what the

735
00:43:40,260 --> 00:43:41,270
name is

736
00:43:41,270 --> 00:43:45,930
but yes

737
00:43:45,930 --> 00:43:50,250
okay know if I can remember the name is
the hardest part in computer science

738
00:43:50,250 --> 00:43:50,620
very

739
00:43:50,620 --> 00:43:57,620
maker good naming in cache invalidation
at the two hardest problem here

740
00:43:57,810 --> 00:44:01,470
yeah does that work

741
00:44:01,470 --> 00:44:04,720
that the other but I joke I remember now
yeah

742
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:08,800
so I if I root my phone and styles and
engine

743
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:12,260
I'm I think I have to install like
clockwork minor some

744
00:44:12,260 --> 00:44:15,660
yes moderate kresa

745
00:44:15,660 --> 00:44:19,200
I can turn out USB debugging but anyone
can boot into recovery mode

746
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:23,090
turned USB debugging on so Germany good
wave keep you know

747
00:44:23,090 --> 00:44:27,020
permanently you can I remove the devoted
reminder

748
00:44:27,020 --> 00:44:30,230
I don't and I i this is

749
00:44:30,230 --> 00:44:34,920
Ben michaud actually cause a major
stress for the past week

750
00:44:34,920 --> 00:44:39,580
because I realized that if you back a
10-minute thank you

751
00:44:39,580 --> 00:44:43,960
or is that a rating no okay I'm stealing
Dayton I'm stealing Jason Scott jokes

752
00:44:43,960 --> 00:44:44,830
now

753
00:44:44,830 --> 00:44:49,339
ahead arm yeah

754
00:44:49,339 --> 00:44:52,940
I'm just archive a minute okay armagh

755
00:44:52,940 --> 00:44:56,400
said so recovery mode know and it's

756
00:44:56,400 --> 00:45:00,140
and so for about a week I've been
looking into this and trying to find a

757
00:45:00,140 --> 00:45:01,129
solution

758
00:45:01,130 --> 00:45:05,000
to this problem being able to bring into
recovery might visit the huge gaping

759
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:05,650
hole

760
00:45:05,650 --> 00:45:09,700
was gonna press rebounds and yeah
exactly animal it takes two minutes ago

761
00:45:09,700 --> 00:45:10,280
going

762
00:45:10,280 --> 00:45:14,040
I mean ran really the solution is to
encrypt is much to be fun as possible

763
00:45:14,040 --> 00:45:17,290
which is why you dinner you to build a
recovery mind that has you

764
00:45:17,290 --> 00:45:20,620
USB debugging feature removed yeah

765
00:45:20,620 --> 00:45:25,069
yeah you could do that Corey you know I
recovery model is password protected

766
00:45:25,070 --> 00:45:28,370
that be a really great project if
somebody wants to write that I would be

767
00:45:28,370 --> 00:45:30,910
happy to cheer you on

768
00:45:30,910 --> 00:45:37,910
item

769
00:45:40,609 --> 00:45:44,470
yeah its bids did well you wouldn't you

770
00:45:44,470 --> 00:45:49,300
you can remove it Justin in the ideally
you can move it just in the bootloader

771
00:45:49,300 --> 00:45:53,890
I the question was you need I USB
debugging to do four things like root

772
00:45:53,890 --> 00:45:55,299
your phone and

773
00:45:55,300 --> 00:45:59,150
right at develop Android applications
and stuff n yeah I mean if you removed

774
00:45:59,150 --> 00:46:00,440
entirely

775
00:46:00,440 --> 00:46:03,710
I they know you will be able to do that
I think the goal would be just to remove

776
00:46:03,710 --> 00:46:04,830
it from the bootloader

777
00:46:04,830 --> 00:46:07,900
and not remove it entirely

778
00:46:07,900 --> 00:46:10,940
whether yeah

779
00:46:10,940 --> 00:46:15,400
Warren air now and I'm I really don't
back

780
00:46:15,400 --> 00:46:18,760
I mean encryption is really the only
solution I have to the problem have

781
00:46:18,760 --> 00:46:24,620
being able to breathe into a recovery
min

782
00:46:24,620 --> 00:46:28,029
I way

783
00:46:28,030 --> 00:46:31,890
now can you

784
00:46:31,890 --> 00:46:36,129
alright no way after after the phone is
rooted yes

785
00:46:36,130 --> 00:46:39,970
yes you can remove rear and go back to
stock firmware

786
00:46:39,970 --> 00:46:45,320
yeah I well I don't know I think the
stock recovery mode still

787
00:46:45,320 --> 00:46:48,920
allies USB debugging does it not

788
00:46:48,920 --> 00:46:53,300
yeah so yeah so it's I mean putting the
stock recovery mod on there doesn't help

789
00:46:53,300 --> 00:46:54,460
the situation at all

790
00:46:54,460 --> 00:46:58,850
the no point in the recovery mode is a
huge gaping fucking security or

791
00:46:58,850 --> 00:47:01,920
I in physical access and somebody really
needs to

792
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:06,600
tid fix that and thats unfortunately not
gonna be me

793
00:47:06,600 --> 00:47:09,750
I think you can also do other hardened

794
00:47:09,750 --> 00:47:13,550
sue binary or remove their and say
engines and talking about

795
00:47:13,550 --> 00:47:18,180
you know enabling it just for certain
things are turning out of but kids that

796
00:47:18,180 --> 00:47:21,580
lethal combination ATB plus right see

797
00:47:21,580 --> 00:47:24,770
your am and its 12

798
00:47:24,770 --> 00:47:30,109
pits the open secure standards source
telephony network talk tomorrow at 5

799
00:47:30,109 --> 00:47:33,440
the really cool thing about Austin is
it's all about you running your own

800
00:47:33,440 --> 00:47:37,650
instances that the server so your own
telephone box so we have like a 12

801
00:47:37,650 --> 00:47:40,970
step script to run your own instanceof
FreeSWITCH

802
00:47:40,970 --> 00:47:44,020
ready to go so we don't want to use our

803
00:47:44,020 --> 00:47:47,750
are still doubt me say like make we 100%

804
00:47:47,750 --> 00:47:51,290
secure switches to bloom so please come
to modified

805
00:47:51,290 --> 00:47:55,240
when I do that thanks for coming in
thank you for

806
00:47:55,240 --> 00:47:58,210
doing the stock is gab thanks for doing
it so we could sit in the back and drink

807
00:47:58,210 --> 00:47:58,680
beer

808
00:47:58,680 --> 00:48:02,000
latter any other questions

809
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:05,760
up or more arm I how much time do I but

810
00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:09,630
tenure 10 a.m. by okay

811
00:48:09,630 --> 00:48:14,290
so in your experience be size Carrier IQ
which is by a lot of phones

812
00:48:14,290 --> 00:48:18,380
other any other anything from Google
that is tracking

813
00:48:18,380 --> 00:48:22,660
keychain text such calls I mean
aluminium

814
00:48:22,660 --> 00:48:26,450
I mean you are paying on your phone to
be tracked by Google

815
00:48:26,450 --> 00:48:30,760
now now is that when you login with your
Gmail account like oil on my gmail

816
00:48:30,760 --> 00:48:34,200
your house nearby gmail if you don't
have a nerd

817
00:48:34,200 --> 00:48:37,270
yet there I'm

818
00:48:37,270 --> 00:48:40,870
yeah if you know if you don't start if
you like a few words and installs a

819
00:48:40,870 --> 00:48:43,020
Nintendo install Google aP's

820
00:48:43,020 --> 00:48:47,970
the phone is not turning onto Google

821
00:48:47,970 --> 00:48:54,050
so you can remove from your Google phone
its and I encourage that

822
00:48:54,050 --> 00:48:58,960
I don't do it myself but I encourage you
to do it

823
00:48:58,960 --> 00:49:03,540
so my questions about any on security a
whole implications that the system

824
00:49:03,540 --> 00:49:04,870
update process

825
00:49:04,870 --> 00:49:09,730
a particular t get some phone they are
hardy notary an update from the carrier

826
00:49:09,730 --> 00:49:12,750
in the manufacture the phone or directly
from Google in case for global

827
00:49:12,750 --> 00:49:13,900
experience phone

828
00:49:13,900 --> 00:49:20,750
right I I mean I can't tell you whether
those packages are signed or not

829
00:49:20,750 --> 00:49:24,980
so I don't know if I mean

830
00:49:24,980 --> 00:49:28,780
yeah I don't know that you can I mean

831
00:49:28,780 --> 00:49:32,839
like oppenheim I mean I i think that
there's been cases where like Microsoft

832
00:49:32,839 --> 00:49:36,920
Patch Tuesday has been compromised with
a queer patches

833
00:49:36,920 --> 00:49:41,580
and I think I'm sure that the same thing
could happen with over there updates

834
00:49:41,580 --> 00:49:47,310
I mean if you added 3G tower I bet you
do pretty easily

835
00:49:47,310 --> 00:49:52,150
there are three back if you read

836
00:49:52,150 --> 00:49:55,560
yeah your

837
00:49:55,560 --> 00:49:58,910
then totally and there's

838
00:49:58,910 --> 00:50:02,359
yeah it's definitely there's that
they're definitely been

839
00:50:02,359 --> 00:50:06,890
malware otay updates I but as far as
detecting whether there's a malware

840
00:50:06,890 --> 00:50:08,609
before you install them

841
00:50:08,609 --> 00:50:13,670
are wat r you get home from the hacker
con to do it yeah

842
00:50:13,670 --> 00:50:17,690
to Anna so can you remove the ad like
did you know tar

843
00:50:17,690 --> 00:50:21,850
certificates are on the Android phone
the family on my neck and lick every

844
00:50:21,850 --> 00:50:22,790
woman's arm

845

sorta gets to the degenerate are they

846
00:50:26,210 --> 00:50:29,609
got a compromised a few years ago the
use in like cereal this is a SSL

847
00:50:29,609 --> 00:50:30,259
certificate

848
00:50:30,260 --> 00:50:33,970
