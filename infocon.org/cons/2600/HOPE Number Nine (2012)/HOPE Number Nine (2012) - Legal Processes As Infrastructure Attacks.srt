1
00:00:01,060 --> 00:00:03,560
so we had a good talk coming up for you
we have

2
00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:08,420
legal practices as infrastructure tax
and I leave the gym I like gonna

3
00:00:08,420 --> 00:00:15,420
per I'd like to present out much %ah

4
00:00:18,199 --> 00:00:22,470
I love the stock I get this ever so
often and I'm modified it I promise I'm

5
00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:25,890
it actually a little bit updated cuz you
know the law changes

6
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:30,640
I'll change tell but right is my passion
for fashion

7
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:34,250
okay why am I giving the stock on cuz

8
00:00:34,250 --> 00:00:37,989
your information and really it's not
just your information is information

9
00:00:37,989 --> 00:00:39,790
that you may have been cast

10
00:00:39,790 --> 00:00:43,629
to defend as a part of your job as a
partner

11
00:00:43,629 --> 00:00:46,750
whatever you have to do with an
organization

12
00:00:46,750 --> 00:00:50,890
and its vulnerable things that you might
not get

13
00:00:50,890 --> 00:00:54,289
we all get our lives I've I'd lock down
my box

14
00:00:54,289 --> 00:00:57,530
could save the date her its are gonna go
to where

15
00:00:57,530 --> 00:01:01,800
the people who are authorized happen and
we think about those things we think

16
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:03,660
about is a cocaine all corralled

17
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:07,549
all safe the problems are other
processes legal process ease

18
00:01:07,549 --> 00:01:13,100
that would crack you open like a walnut
this all stems from a

19
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:17,750
really really drunken conversation had
time on a hacker con

20
00:01:17,750 --> 00:01:21,080
now this very rarely happen and on

21
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:25,950
I discovered people talk about how
secure the boxes were under said look

22
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:28,950
you know what in 10 minutes I could have
you

23
00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:32,579
i cant all the information I want your
systems and the best part is

24
00:01:32,579 --> 00:01:36,579
I will make you help me find it her

25
00:01:36,579 --> 00:01:40,060
in someone's like had to talk again some

26
00:01:40,060 --> 00:01:43,210
so your your impressions farmer

27
00:01:43,210 --> 00:01:46,689
two processes you are familiar with and
it's being handled by people who don't

28
00:01:46,689 --> 00:01:48,189
think like we do

29
00:01:48,189 --> 00:01:51,250
who soon well it has a password

30
00:01:51,250 --> 00:01:56,079
therefore it's safe are no one
understands that system

31
00:01:56,079 --> 00:01:59,899
so therefore the data safe on and we you
know we bristle

32
00:01:59,899 --> 00:02:04,110
constantly too bad but Knollwood much
has been audited or less I know exactly

33
00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:05,119
how else to word

34
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:08,860
it's not safe it's not safe until I say
it isn't even then I'm still paranoid

35
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:14,110
arm the promise that this babe gets
handed off to other people willy nilly

36
00:02:14,110 --> 00:02:17,920
what I'm hoping to do with the stock

37
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:21,110
explain roughly have the legal system
works

38
00:02:21,110 --> 00:02:26,110
this will be your date on show you how
to prepare for these

39
00:02:26,110 --> 00:02:29,709
as best you can so

40
00:02:29,709 --> 00:02:34,970
standard disclaimer I am an attorney
just not your

41
00:02:34,970 --> 00:02:38,000
that can be remedied

42
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:43,970
on this field have large influx that's
my standard disclaimer because well

43
00:02:43,970 --> 00:02:45,080
things change

44
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:49,879
arm the law is whatever a bunch of
people in black robes say it is

45
00:02:49,879 --> 00:02:54,268
that's a nice way of saying I may be
wrong

46
00:02:54,269 --> 00:02:58,269
cell kinds of attacks kinds approaches
that

47
00:02:58,269 --> 00:03:02,400
legal people like me can take to try to
get you

48
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:06,220
to give us your data first 17

49
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:11,790
this is for civil lawsuits anbe wish to
sue one another about something

50
00:03:11,790 --> 00:03:15,429
and you have to perhaps to to get
someone to crack open their

51
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:19,730
crack open their systems we've got civil
discovery and you've got a subpoena

52
00:03:19,730 --> 00:03:24,220
then you've got criminal search warrants
and related warrants

53
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:27,569
wiretap Warren stored Communications Act
Barnes and

54
00:03:27,569 --> 00:03:31,010
third-party I want to talk about that
separate makers it's been kinda for

55
00:03:31,010 --> 00:03:34,359
why I updated the stock cell

56
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:38,549
one is discovery it's the middle phase
obligation

57
00:03:38,549 --> 00:03:42,049
for started something we call a
complaint in answer which is

58
00:03:42,049 --> 00:03:45,400
kind of like I when we

59
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:48,870
when known we solve problems with
violence

60
00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:52,680
and the way you would start a fight as
you would show up and smacked the other

61
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:54,420
person in the face with a glove

62
00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:59,230
well the legal approach to that is a
complaint I'm suing you for the

63
00:03:59,230 --> 00:04:00,549
following reasons:

64
00:04:00,549 --> 00:04:04,180
and the answer which is oh yeah your
mama

65
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:07,310
discovery it's a

66
00:04:07,310 --> 00:04:10,510
this usually so it's in class here on

67
00:04:10,510 --> 00:04:14,769
discoveries the middle step and this is
that this is the 1i wanna talk about

68
00:04:14,769 --> 00:04:17,820
its information and gathering and
sorting

69
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:22,159
from both sides each side has two
bombing of a certain amount of relevant

70
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:22,919
information

71
00:04:22,919 --> 00:04:26,090
to give the other side because you're
trying to figure out

72
00:04:26,090 --> 00:04:31,479
want can we can actually show in the
complaint an answer is true

73
00:04:31,479 --> 00:04:36,940
so therefore a judge can rule on it and
say your douchebag you are the other

74
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:37,780
side a lot of money

75
00:04:37,780 --> 00:04:43,270
are you don't know the other side a lot
of money and gets also I

76
00:04:43,270 --> 00:04:46,969
information-gathering from both sides
and other third parties in the second

77
00:04:46,970 --> 00:04:49,160
and third step the last step is

78
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:52,660
presentation in San on so trial

79
00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:57,690
arbitration arm you show the other side
but you had and they decide

80
00:04:57,690 --> 00:05:01,360
Wow I'm be kinda prove their case and
we've got nothing

81
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:05,300
and you go to your client if your lawyer
in same now we gotta settle this

82
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:09,650
com cats and mice you wanna continue
paying me money

83
00:05:09,650 --> 00:05:13,460
I usually actually say things like that
kinda shock

84
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:18,000
so discovery process at the start each
party to the litigation

85
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,160
has to identify and disclose the sources

86
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:26,520
are potentially responsible yes I year
size electronically stored information

87
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:29,979
bets the Federal Rules Civil Procedure

88
00:05:29,979 --> 00:05:34,520
bad is broad as hell

89
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:38,500
electronically stored information is not
just emails in Word documents and

90
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:40,210
PowerPoint decks

91
00:05:40,210 --> 00:05:43,770
is potentially raw data I have seen
cases

92
00:05:43,770 --> 00:05:48,639
where the real lawsuits quiver randomly
generated data for signal casting

93
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:53,020
perper I'm sorry for circuit testing and
one side soon for its like

94
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:56,830
it was randomly generated data that went
to the circuit and then went to death

95
00:05:56,830 --> 00:05:57,849
now

96
00:05:57,850 --> 00:06:01,110
and we want that big random

97
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:05,039
you know I can give you a lot helping
Deb random it'll be

98
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:08,270
roughly the same know we want the ones
that use like

99
00:06:08,270 --> 00:06:14,960
deleted years ago we never thought we
would need to keep better

100
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:19,109
so each party has two tell the other
side here's what we have

101
00:06:19,110 --> 00:06:22,500
you have to get nationally hand or the
information you had to say these are the

102
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:26,090
sources been for mation

103
00:06:26,090 --> 00:06:30,270
and you have to preserve it you have to
prevent all that bad

104
00:06:30,270 --> 00:06:34,698
once you know the litigation starting
either you've been sued

105
00:06:34,699 --> 00:06:39,180
you've gotten a letter from the opposing
side saying we have a problem

106
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:42,780
we are going to we're going to
contemplate legal action

107
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:46,060
something it says old there's a problem

108
00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:49,110
are something really really obvious like

109
00:06:49,110 --> 00:06:52,190
arm that been rebuilt

110
00:06:52,190 --> 00:06:56,430
exploded for no apparent reason be a
think this might end in litigation

111
00:06:56,430 --> 00:07:00,080
yeah at that point matter now prevent
any event

112
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:06,039
any the relevant information you hold
from getting destroyed

113
00:07:06,039 --> 00:07:10,009
I'm I will talk about that

114
00:07:10,009 --> 00:07:13,860
so first year to preserving then you
have to compile compile it and put in

115
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:14,449
some kinda

116
00:07:14,449 --> 00:07:18,270
format that human beings can look at
Ingo

117
00:07:18,270 --> 00:07:21,659
is this actually useful to the
litigation is this

118
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:26,430
gonna help us are hurdles with another
side need to see that state to

119
00:07:26,430 --> 00:07:30,889
figure out what actually happened this
sometimes gets really complicated

120
00:07:30,889 --> 00:07:31,430
because

121
00:07:31,430 --> 00:07:35,599
I would often get asked what I have
heard I the database file how do I make

122
00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:35,960
this

123
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:40,240
in a review before Matt and sometimes
the nest blow it to a printer

124
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:43,979
see you have a nineteen thousand page
document that's just the wrong

125
00:07:43,979 --> 00:07:47,669
database file I'm

126
00:07:47,669 --> 00:07:50,930
kinda interesting what I do with that
I'm billing by the hour

127
00:07:50,930 --> 00:07:54,120
I review every page because I'm paid to
do them

128
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:57,650
RI I don't do that anymore thank God but
I've seen people

129
00:07:57,650 --> 00:08:01,669
clicking through and it's really amazing
like

130
00:08:01,669 --> 00:08:06,008
I have a person a human being with a
high IQ

131
00:08:06,009 --> 00:08:09,259
who is looking at pages and pages and
pages

132
00:08:09,259 --> 00:08:12,789
up little cracker and yet don't bill

133
00:08:12,789 --> 00:08:17,699
four-acre to think about that when we
talk about costs

134
00:08:17,699 --> 00:08:21,240
okay so we have to compile our we to
sort through it

135
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:25,319
to find responses stuff this is stuff
that

136
00:08:25,319 --> 00:08:28,539
happens to be related to the stuff we're
suing

137
00:08:28,539 --> 00:08:32,088
for to see for example two companies

138
00:08:32,089 --> 00:08:36,479
AMB have a contract to license should
maybe do a cross-licensing

139
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:40,940
intellectual property Basu would render

140
00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:44,399
everything that A&B have about that
intellectual property

141
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:48,060
is responsive everything they have to
they have to talk about

142
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:51,540
about the contract what their agreements
that's responsive

143
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:55,089
everything they've talked about about
the contract to each other

144
00:08:55,089 --> 00:09:00,070
is responsive it may not represented in
court it's a much broader definition

145
00:09:00,070 --> 00:09:01,300
it's really really wide

146
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:04,440
its anything that may lead to this is
stuff like

147
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:07,660
information about a meeting member gonna
sit down and talk about what we're gonna

148
00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:08,730
give the other

149
00:09:08,730 --> 00:09:14,209
the the the other party response of

150
00:09:14,209 --> 00:09:17,209
endure sorting through it also findings
are privileged things

151
00:09:17,209 --> 00:09:22,070
bad while they may be responsive you
don't necessarily have to divulge

152
00:09:22,070 --> 00:09:27,000
like attorney-client privilege some
trade secret to protect the ball

153
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,370
arm try think other examples in a can of
the top my head

154
00:09:30,370 --> 00:09:34,060
but your sorting through these giant
giant China datasets

155
00:09:34,060 --> 00:09:37,519
looking for stuff but you have to get to
the other side

156
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:40,580
and your also when you're doing this
you're looking through stuff

157
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:45,430
that proves your side skates while
you're handing out at all the crap they

158
00:09:45,430 --> 00:09:45,880
get

159
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:49,970
winners anything we have that we want to
leave around at a deposition or trial in

160
00:09:49,970 --> 00:09:51,399
arbitration says

161
00:09:51,399 --> 00:09:54,730
this proves we are right

162
00:09:54,730 --> 00:09:59,029
so you're looking for that matter

163
00:09:59,029 --> 00:10:02,560
seller discovery if experts say massive

164
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:08,250
exfiltration updater Republican gigs and
gigs and gigs threes what's next for

165
00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:09,310
transient data

166
00:10:09,310 --> 00:10:13,600
is you were handing the stuff of

167
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:16,959
to third party vendors to handle

168
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:21,180
for example arm one of my subcontractors

169
00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:25,380
his job is to go when a litigation is
filed show up with a stack

170
00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:28,740
I'll I'm USB hard drives and

171
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:32,399
forensically capture the entire hard
drives

172
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:36,040
are people at companies

173
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:39,189
he now holds their baby daughter he's

174
00:10:39,190 --> 00:10:42,480
I he's a nice enough guy is he might be
bonded but

175
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:46,220
you're handing all had stopover to some
guy

176
00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:49,990
who is a good one step up from wearing a
sham pressured says like your company's

177
00:10:49,990 --> 00:10:53,470
computer guy

178
00:10:53,470 --> 00:10:58,790
and the best part is he is going to hand
it off to a vendor

179
00:10:58,790 --> 00:11:01,939
will be cont'd discovering vendor who's
going to confer

180
00:11:01,940 --> 00:11:05,540
all the documents there into kips RPD
apps

181
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:09,360
everything every email every Word
document

182
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:14,370
every text file and if they don't parse
it right I've seen people take the

183
00:11:14,370 --> 00:11:16,589
entire contents have hard drives

184
00:11:16,589 --> 00:11:21,589
and you're reading Java classes that
have been turned into PDF's

185
00:11:21,589 --> 00:11:25,820
in your looking for going this is a Java
class why did make pars for this

186
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:29,670
to go might be responsible no we're not
suing sign

187
00:11:29,670 --> 00:11:33,130
it's not useful how do you know like

188
00:11:33,130 --> 00:11:36,320
I its please trust me yeltsin

189
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:41,190
and going through and M usually the one
you're doing these giant giant

190
00:11:41,190 --> 00:11:44,470
but beta Sox you get to read through

191
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:48,910
you get a seat all M you get to see all
the stuff that's on this user's PC

192
00:11:48,910 --> 00:11:52,740
now think all the Croft that is on your
on your machine

193
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:56,660
guiding bore the crap that's on my
niggas you do what I did buy new machine

194
00:11:56,660 --> 00:11:59,810
and you copy everything that was on all
the hard drive

195
00:11:59,810 --> 00:12:04,560
will hurt your new home directory again
and again and again

196
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:07,720
and sometimes into a copy just look at
the Barnes go

197
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:10,940
ok she is this at all that porn when

198
00:12:10,940 --> 00:12:14,459
sorry I'm best for those client file
sweater

199
00:12:14,459 --> 00:12:17,880
but then conferred computer users if
those have you were

200
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:23,660
in in like customer-facing ID thing to
behold the stop you found and users PCs

201
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:28,300
that could suck down and don't to
e-discovery vendor who takes all that

202
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:30,110
stuff and blows the PDF

203
00:12:30,110 --> 00:12:34,370
so all that Jay peg and give porn is now
convert the PDF

204
00:12:34,370 --> 00:12:39,260
in a searchable for for for text if
there is text in it

205
00:12:39,260 --> 00:12:43,040
at some cost but it's handed off to a
third party

206
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:47,899
and how do we select that third-party

207
00:12:47,899 --> 00:12:51,950
answer the lowest bidder

208
00:12:51,950 --> 00:12:57,380
so it's cool its three guys with with a
pirated copy of law 5.0

209
00:12:57,380 --> 00:13:01,300
to convert this crap in the PDS for
searching

210
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:05,720
awesome you don't even know you is your
intersect people

211
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:10,279
generally don't know who that provider
is because legal shows up and says

212
00:13:10,279 --> 00:13:13,389
this guy who

213
00:13:13,389 --> 00:13:16,730
has given three fingers on one hand has
used be a shop teacher

214
00:13:16,730 --> 00:13:21,329
but he understands how in case works
good in of

215
00:13:21,329 --> 00:13:26,740
that he is going to go to your CFR oh
and take the entire contents of the hard

216
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:28,269
drive

217
00:13:28,269 --> 00:13:31,990
how scary is that

218
00:13:31,990 --> 00:13:36,440
not that scary okay I'm I'm never having
this conversation sitting at someone's

219
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:38,540
desk it was a CFL for a

220
00:13:38,540 --> 00:13:42,310
for bike a fortune 1000 company Mike

221
00:13:42,310 --> 00:13:45,370
you know I showed up

222
00:13:45,370 --> 00:13:48,529
I'm wearing a suit I have a hard drive

223
00:13:48,529 --> 00:13:53,779
and I showed you a business card why why
would not be a problem I

224
00:13:53,779 --> 00:13:57,189
I'll if there's a empezar person with a
with a hundred feet

225
00:13:57,190 --> 00:14:00,740
and if I just said that like yeah how do
we that you might have a business card

226
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:02,790
because that would prove me

227
00:14:02,790 --> 00:14:06,560
you know but I pursued I'm clearly trust

228
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:10,050
your trustable right I missed you're
taking all your data

229
00:14:10,050 --> 00:14:14,149
it's okay and ago when you steal
anything on your must be on anything

230
00:14:14,149 --> 00:14:18,360
you're right all but all the pencils and
pens there in spirit they are

231
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:22,880
Creek are by the way sorry I need the
password to get into your Lotus Notes

232
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:24,510
file XXI need to be cryptic

233
00:14:24,510 --> 00:14:28,050
are located the your

234
00:14:28,050 --> 00:14:31,209
completely trust more why would you do
that but

235
00:14:31,209 --> 00:14:34,449
I hot this is such a such a security
hole

236
00:14:34,449 --> 00:14:40,690
because I sent him from the legal
department all the sudden you trust me

237
00:14:40,690 --> 00:14:46,800
sober other exultation data the exhibits
the documents that you pick out of this

238
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:51,199
hmmm II giant data stream

239
00:14:51,199 --> 00:14:55,880
sometimes become public documents this
is sometimes really embarrassing there's

240
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:56,689
a case

241
00:14:56,690 --> 00:15:00,139
are coupled it came up couple weeks ago
where

242
00:15:00,139 --> 00:15:03,730
someone put a bunch of trade secrets
inadvertently

243
00:15:03,730 --> 00:15:06,959
in a motion which then

244
00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:11,829
went on to pacer which is the docking
system for the entire federal court

245
00:15:11,829 --> 00:15:16,680
pacer documents our public you don't
have to be an attorney to have a log on

246
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:21,029
you can to say I wanna log on and you
can search through these and sometimes

247
00:15:21,029 --> 00:15:23,290
you find really ridiculous stop

248
00:15:23,290 --> 00:15:26,969
because someone didn't think well that's
not publicly yes

249
00:15:26,970 --> 00:15:31,269
it's absolutely public many people
tackled on pacer and The Miz make a

250
00:15:31,269 --> 00:15:32,149
Google

251
00:15:32,149 --> 00:15:35,209
because it's easier than using the
search function MP Sir

252
00:15:35,209 --> 00:15:38,769
ants all house at you at this is all
secret

253
00:15:38,769 --> 00:15:42,750
no then again I'm also a decline was
like oh you can't show this complaint

254
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:43,880
anybody like

255
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:47,689
its public well we want to keep it
secure

256
00:15:47,690 --> 00:15:50,920
its public like your

257
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:54,279
download it see it's not a secret
anymore

258
00:15:54,279 --> 00:15:57,720
who knows about this like every on
practices in the federal courts we have

259
00:15:57,720 --> 00:15:58,839
to go

260
00:15:58,839 --> 00:16:04,389
sour exhibits are public documents and
sometimes a really embarrassing once

261
00:16:04,389 --> 00:16:09,540
other downside if are other affected
discoveries it's expensive to do

262
00:16:09,540 --> 00:16:12,589
our explain why go through

263
00:16:12,589 --> 00:16:16,399
and peak the entire contents have your
hard drive

264
00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:21,410
maybe that's $250 to $500 thousand
documents

265
00:16:21,410 --> 00:16:24,839
now imagine we've converted them to PDF

266
00:16:24,839 --> 00:16:29,720
and you read each document to figure out
what it is

267
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:34,220
who was reading that document an
attorney

268
00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:38,540
billing 14 to 16 hours a day

269
00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:42,920
reading through those documents how
expensive now is that one terabyte hard

270
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:46,120
drive

271
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:49,350
arm it's amazing how Washburn raids

272
00:16:49,350 --> 00:16:52,560
other million dollars a month on a
mid-size litigation

273
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:55,769
and wanna when is the kind gonna go we
got a saddle

274
00:16:55,769 --> 00:17:00,670
cuz bring were bombing money in each
other I realized like Mitch

275
00:17:00,670 --> 00:17:04,289
mosser big size civil litigation is like
playing chicken except you just have

276
00:17:04,289 --> 00:17:06,890
bundles a hundred-dollar bills and set
them on fire

277
00:17:06,890 --> 00:17:09,900
only at I got 21 fire pigeons

278
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:13,600
and and initially I i look at that and
go

279
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:16,650
my god this is awful but then again like
I get some

280
00:17:16,650 --> 00:17:20,620
fat like mine my job is like okay at
your job to burn hundred-dollar bills

281
00:17:20,620 --> 00:17:26,089
but you can take a few of the top of the
stack okay you should burns more men

282
00:17:26,089 --> 00:17:28,960
can I can occur when the disk right now
on but I'm not here but I'm not a guy

283
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:30,370
not yet like

284
00:17:30,370 --> 00:17:34,809
and it's amazing as you get someone
who's angry you get some CEOs like

285
00:17:34,809 --> 00:17:38,289
I'm going to litigate this to the
Supreme Court like and and there's a

286
00:17:38,289 --> 00:17:41,789
public this is ridiculous and the other
hand I have a mortgage

287
00:17:41,789 --> 00:17:45,320
and I've student months might get you
large should take that all the way to

288
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:46,149
the Supreme Court

289
00:17:46,150 --> 00:17:51,580
and I'll do it but you money wasted
accepted I get some of it

290
00:17:51,580 --> 00:17:55,460
cell hah but I'm by Esther

291
00:17:55,460 --> 00:17:58,799
so it's time consuming to collect and
assemble

292
00:17:58,799 --> 00:18:03,460
this takes time it's grueling and you're
reviewing: it by attorneys

293
00:18:03,460 --> 00:18:06,500
who are sitting im

294
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:13,350
dank airless rooms angry because their
job is to review these documents

295
00:18:13,350 --> 00:18:16,950
it's really expensive I didn't make that
clear

296
00:18:16,950 --> 00:18:20,980
sour discovery defense how do you
protect yours

297
00:18:20,980 --> 00:18:25,630
your organization from this awful awful
attack

298
00:18:25,630 --> 00:18:28,549
and rescue a mess with the sound the
legal once you understand what the

299
00:18:28,549 --> 00:18:30,470
lawyers are doing or not doing

300
00:18:30,470 --> 00:18:34,669
and then what you can do in the ITN in
for a sec departments

301
00:18:34,669 --> 00:18:37,840
up your organization so legal approach

302
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:42,379
is what the what we innocently call a
document retention policy

303
00:18:42,380 --> 00:18:47,289
how many view just kinda felt that your
soul left your body when I sent that

304
00:18:47,289 --> 00:18:50,799
this is actually amps I'm writing peace
now

305
00:18:50,799 --> 00:18:53,860
and there are actually a lot of fun but
for me i'd

306
00:18:53,860 --> 00:18:58,830
I'm your abt the advantages

307
00:18:58,830 --> 00:19:02,000
the document that doesn't exist cannot
buy

308
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,160
UMES

309
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:09,110
as Brad said earlier what if the
documents get lost

310
00:19:09,110 --> 00:19:12,140
what if you are allowed to destroy them

311
00:19:12,140 --> 00:19:15,440
sell that one where someone wrote in
email about

312
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:19,080
and think about all the embarrassing
things your users

313
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:22,250
day any now

314
00:19:22,250 --> 00:19:25,590
all the really ridiculous things
teaching catch the rack

315
00:19:25,590 --> 00:19:28,699
on that the new associate on the key be

316
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:32,179
ditcher now oh my god

317
00:19:32,179 --> 00:19:37,410
you know we completely mangled that
project call by the revolution reinforce

318
00:19:37,410 --> 00:19:38,320
the bumper

319
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:41,689
can tell I mean it's only a nickel yet
use

320
00:19:41,690 --> 00:19:45,660
people buying ridiculous things are born
with a Geisha House

321
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:48,820
on on those a software litigation

322
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:53,220
and one person admitted you know we've
never done this before

323
00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:56,770
we should pop we should stop the sales
people from saying we've with these

324
00:19:56,770 --> 00:20:00,820
out successfully ok

325
00:20:00,820 --> 00:20:04,120
and i'm looking guy who did on one hand

326
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:09,000
CE mi I found the I found the big
glaring document the promises of

327
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:12,130
are crying to send that to

328
00:20:12,130 --> 00:20:16,159
well we found a really interesting
document the problem is kinda visit nail

329
00:20:16,159 --> 00:20:17,780
in their coffin

330
00:20:17,780 --> 00:20:22,559
on the other hand it's better that you
know about it now than I was just

331
00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:25,950
clicking through in handing the other
side the other side is like blind siding

332
00:20:25,950 --> 00:20:26,789
you with that

333
00:20:26,789 --> 00:20:30,750
at a deposition at four in the afternoon
you like did you know that only I

334
00:20:30,750 --> 00:20:31,799
decided

335
00:20:31,799 --> 00:20:36,110
what does completely screwed the pooch
we fuck them over me

336
00:20:36,110 --> 00:20:40,789
a circle local term from upstate New
York it means are we look forward to

337
00:20:40,789 --> 00:20:41,789
doing business with you

338
00:20:41,789 --> 00:20:44,789
you would WordPress been there before
habits but

339
00:20:44,789 --> 00:20:47,879
reading this insight so

340
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:51,100
if you can destroy the document legally
it's a nice thing to do

341
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:55,179
so if you write a document retention
policies says any document were certain

342
00:20:55,179 --> 00:20:55,789
be

343
00:20:55,789 --> 00:20:58,840
unless litigations filed can be
destroyed

344
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:03,799
so that way you know what to put the bed

345
00:21:03,799 --> 00:21:07,789
also once litigation is hard sometimes
you can negotiate down the scope of the

346
00:21:07,789 --> 00:21:08,610
data because the

347
00:21:08,610 --> 00:21:12,740
the each side is also looking at this
and they don't want the massive data

348
00:21:12,740 --> 00:21:14,960
dump to be handed over to them

349
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:19,400
because like I said the analogy with
burning hundred-dollar bills the

350
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:24,679
end okay we found 1.2 million documents
American handy your lawyers and they're

351
00:21:24,679 --> 00:21:26,419
gonna look through them

352
00:21:26,419 --> 00:21:31,059
the burning continues because now they
gotta go through all your

353
00:21:31,059 --> 00:21:34,270
you know the other side got a good for
all your shit /img /url

354
00:21:34,270 --> 00:21:38,480
is this useful now now now now

355
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:42,240
and given your users how many times how
many times have you seen

356
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:45,700
users download the same attachment
Woburn Woburn Woburn

357
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:52,280
over and over again I have we cease 18
copies in the same document

358
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:56,330
someone reviewed all 8 p.m.

359
00:21:56,330 --> 00:22:00,889
so bad document that bad that one-page
document about

360
00:22:00,890 --> 00:22:05,950
you know did number appropriately
funding the coffee fund

361
00:22:05,950 --> 00:22:09,110
cost like eighteen thousand dollars

362
00:22:09,110 --> 00:22:13,720
because so many attorneys had to look
through that again and again and again

363
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:17,760
so negotiates go camping hiking this
stuff isn't relevant this stuff isn't

364
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:22,460
these people we don't need to scour
their hard drives

365
00:22:22,460 --> 00:22:25,650
arm if you can argue that some things
just like your

366
00:22:25,650 --> 00:22:29,630
your command is ridiculous let's shoot
what's narrow the scope of it

367
00:22:29,630 --> 00:22:33,460
awesome and also you can say things like
a lot of the day you want

368
00:22:33,460 --> 00:22:38,200
is not readily accessible it is in some
kind of hard to get

369
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:42,110
form like its obsolete

370
00:22:42,110 --> 00:22:46,260
you know and sometimes this is my job
which is

371
00:22:46,260 --> 00:22:49,289
turns out bad the company used

372
00:22:49,289 --> 00:22:52,620
clarice works as their because it was
cheaper

373
00:22:52,620 --> 00:22:55,640
and you like how we blow to the PDF Mike

374
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:58,909
let me get back here now we're going to

but and in five ok

378
00:23:11,980 --> 00:23:15,580
and it's also because I could and I used

email calling up olds is a min to get

one work

382
00:23:26,679 --> 00:23:29,980
I'm settings up like it means I don't
have to review those documents in a

383
00:23:29,980 --> 00:23:30,360
month

384
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:33,950
a while dork out with some ancient
technology

385
00:23:33,950 --> 00:23:38,470
and at the end it's like yeah I'm energy
converters clarice work documents

386
00:23:38,470 --> 00:23:43,309
PR you know again Mac exchange 2.0 from
1993

387
00:23:43,309 --> 00:23:49,139
into a text file that you can now review
the Cure G music no its side

388
00:23:49,140 --> 00:23:52,250
all good trivia from like old Mac shops

389
00:23:52,250 --> 00:23:57,279
you like and you get like it you know I
remember getting a staggered 800

392
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:11,450
and I'm baylon I'm end up going for him
reading this and said

393
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:15,679
anarchy how did you know I do that like
I'm diaper

394

yet Mac I remembered that stuff but
again like crazy said I love them like

395
00:24:20,340 --> 00:24:24,158
how was more because as more fun than
actually being a lawyer I got a problem

396
00:24:24,159 --> 00:24:24,909
now

397
00:24:24,909 --> 00:24:30,020
that no one can fault me because I took
a different path has like no one else is

398
00:24:30,020 --> 00:24:30,389
gonna

399
00:24:30,390 --> 00:24:35,740
touch that god damn day your doesn't
really fun when you call a Mac shopping

400
00:24:35,740 --> 00:24:36,210
go I

401
00:24:36,210 --> 00:24:40,240
actually need abort from a Mac SC
because mine just fried

402
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:43,330
and its actually like real money but no
its not economic

403
00:24:43,330 --> 00:24:46,730
Dutson into it's a it's a twenty-two
million dollar

404
00:24:46,730 --> 00:24:51,340
litigation I need a Mac SC I will pay in
the current one

405
00:24:51,340 --> 00:24:55,449
like how much I don't know how much
haven't have a hundred dollars a day

406
00:24:55,450 --> 00:24:59,070
really be yeah ugh some I'm its clients
money

407
00:24:59,070 --> 00:25:03,620
arrangement I've been tonight if you can
guarantee the soccer works

408
00:25:03,620 --> 00:25:07,299
because at the end but I get actually
useful data

409
00:25:07,299 --> 00:25:11,610
and bad I do that that was some agassi
woodworking not in LC

410
00:25:11,610 --> 00:25:14,850
like okay so

411
00:25:14,850 --> 00:25:18,929
not really you can say we don't need
Alex to be dicking around with Mac junk

412
00:25:18,929 --> 00:25:22,789
to get those few pieces a bid to say
they don't exist anymore

413
00:25:22,789 --> 00:25:28,158
there they are effectively gone the
technical approach

414
00:25:28,159 --> 00:25:31,440
mention that you can have this legal
consequence document retention policies

415
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:32,150
as

416
00:25:32,150 --> 00:25:35,779
every document were ninety days gets
deleted no matter what

417
00:25:35,779 --> 00:25:39,429
so that way you can say we only have 90
days worth the beta

418
00:25:39,429 --> 00:25:44,289
you soon as today we going right have to
go back a quarter

419
00:25:44,289 --> 00:25:48,960
we don't have to talk about stuff
previous the problem is

420
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:52,900
is that you get eight people document
that says

421
00:25:52,900 --> 00:25:57,549
all baidoa over 90 days you shouldn't
have

422
00:25:57,549 --> 00:26:02,710
how many of your users are going to
follow this your

423
00:26:02,710 --> 00:26:06,070
in okay both of them

424
00:26:06,070 --> 00:26:10,480
may all out knowing your users

425
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:16,830
that means but documents get printed and
put in a binder somewhere

426
00:26:16,830 --> 00:26:19,928
I've done i've seen that remember one

427
00:26:19,929 --> 00:26:24,480
one company like over so smart with a
30-day docking retention policy inside

428
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:27,679
you know that's about as dumb as
requiring you know

429
00:26:27,679 --> 00:26:32,529
epic ECA epic pass power sign I would so
secure it now I just need some

430
00:26:32,529 --> 00:26:36,760
fucking posted now you know it's the
same a pro-taliban 30 David which means

431
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:42,330
you have stacks and stacks and stacks of
paper documents that were printed

432
00:26:42,330 --> 00:26:45,399
and that means you've just tripled your
cost because now

433
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:49,390
instead of having an easily incredible
electronic document you will be printed

434
00:26:49,390 --> 00:26:50,150
document

435
00:26:50,150 --> 00:26:54,490
that some schmuck has to step up on a
scanner

436
00:26:54,490 --> 00:26:58,710
and OC harder and their little twitchy

437
00:26:58,710 --> 00:27:03,650
bad NCR comes out as you know coverup
not going to pick as the old I was

438
00:27:03,650 --> 00:27:04,210
snoring

439
00:27:04,210 --> 00:27:07,779
don't snore horribly wrong which means
you have some were other Shin ok

440
00:27:07,779 --> 00:27:13,529
some point we're going I'm think it's
perhaps I was to take me a long time

441
00:27:13,529 --> 00:27:15,100
they're blowing it up it's like

442
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:18,120
so it took you 45 minutes to read

443
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:22,960
that clarice works documented some
asshole printed five years ago when it

444
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:25,809
if he just kept electronic with them and
grab it nope

445
00:27:25,809 --> 00:27:29,690
not the main actor next but now someone
had to get ready

446
00:27:29,690 --> 00:27:33,399
but technical approach if you can
actually make it happen

447
00:27:33,399 --> 00:27:37,470
sorry but by for that document as
passive stockman pension policy

448
00:27:37,470 --> 00:27:41,370
but go bye-bye really really useful

449
00:27:41,370 --> 00:27:47,090
it's also the home wanted these the
technical department has to look after

450
00:27:47,090 --> 00:27:50,580
how many people have a basement in their
shop

451
00:27:50,580 --> 00:27:54,639
that has old or missions

452
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:57,899
all the deal what's on those all
admissions

453
00:27:57,899 --> 00:28:01,710
good will actually answers

454
00:28:01,710 --> 00:28:05,539
I'm home stop why do you keep 'em

455
00:28:05,539 --> 00:28:09,950
I might need the park is comparable good
your own only needed three eighty six

456
00:28:09,950 --> 00:28:12,490
cuz I'm not part do it but we might need

457
00:28:12,490 --> 00:28:15,860
and I get you out here on this episode

458
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:19,309
Amy's warders technology addiction them

459
00:28:19,309 --> 00:28:24,869
we go to bob bob is a UNIX sysadmin the
forefoot beard

460
00:28:24,869 --> 00:28:29,200
there can be good sports you shouldn't
compare me to him

461
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:33,749
and DL home I'd say that cuz I may have
a spark station in my basement

462
00:28:33,749 --> 00:28:36,840
said did might be needed just don't have
the beard anymore

463
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:41,610
om so that I actually think that the
doctor tension policies also old

464
00:28:41,610 --> 00:28:42,639
machines

465
00:28:42,639 --> 00:28:46,029
and sometimes you can convince well

466
00:28:46,029 --> 00:28:49,710
I've tried to convince some people that
the best way to get rid of

467
00:28:49,710 --> 00:28:53,039
all beta is to actually physically
destroy the drive

468
00:28:53,039 --> 00:28:57,629
and on the best way to destroy drivers
with all well know is that most in the

469
00:28:57,629 --> 00:28:59,269
gutter

470
00:28:59,269 --> 00:29:06,269
argue like American stuff too I'm not
you know

471
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:09,840
yes it's cheaper ok

472
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:15,330
on okay also though the other way you
can reduce costs and protect your

473
00:29:15,330 --> 00:29:19,899
your your company is the building to
preserve identify in search of the stuff

474
00:29:19,899 --> 00:29:25,940
arm it's amazing I'm 1.high started
talking to people about doing project

475
00:29:25,940 --> 00:29:28,639
management for these big litigation
because I was a

476
00:29:28,639 --> 00:29:32,559
so also a tech geek was what tools you
using a mic

477
00:29:32,559 --> 00:29:36,029
grab new ones I wanna spend a lotta shit

478
00:29:36,029 --> 00:29:41,129
grab but with a better other tools grab

479
00:29:41,129 --> 00:29:44,549
ok my cock I'm that works right

480
00:29:44,549 --> 00:29:48,999
you know like L other industrial tools
that do that better

481
00:29:48,999 --> 00:29:53,259
it's a text file writer at some get a
bunch a text files in a directory like

482
00:29:53,259 --> 00:29:56,259
I'm sure there are tools that much
graphic interfaces but

483
00:29:56,259 --> 00:29:59,639
for one user you know but I haven't
needed to yet

484
00:29:59,639 --> 00:30:02,659
when when you don't like I'll play with
them but

485
00:30:02,659 --> 00:30:06,830
mobile I want to just use that like a
site not ever hit in hebron need

486
00:30:06,830 --> 00:30:07,610
something else

487
00:30:07,610 --> 00:30:11,639
and I am bats like a magic to like
regular orders like

488
00:30:11,639 --> 00:30:17,149
so you can search over multiple
directories ok

489
00:30:17,149 --> 00:30:20,999
yeah on wait a minute but we have
multiple systems we've got these

490
00:30:20,999 --> 00:30:26,080
mix boxes and we've got these I'm these
Windows servers and his Mac servers like

491
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:30,759
Ivan I was conducted mount oldest grab
what to do they had

492
00:30:30,759 --> 00:30:34,269
Matt directories all the documents it
had those repeat those search terms like

493
00:30:34,269 --> 00:30:37,690

repeating I'd grab

495
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:43,859
& like Mike had some a magical talisman
but

496
00:30:43,859 --> 00:30:47,639
trust me ads that's how we're cool one
uses other tools like they wouldn't work

497
00:30:47,639 --> 00:30:48,899
on the Mac on my desk

498
00:30:48,899 --> 00:30:53,700

536
00:33:02,519 --> 00:33:06,220
anything else was destroyed per the
document retention policy

537
00:33:06,220 --> 00:33:11,399
Houska also came back and didn't budge

538
00:33:11,399 --> 00:33:14,849
knowingly if you think about user access
rules

539
00:33:14,849 --> 00:33:18,349
no which employees have access to what
because

540
00:33:18,349 --> 00:33:23,899
imagine you've got some litigation where
they named fifteen people about have

541
00:33:23,899 --> 00:33:27,879
access to the data that is important in
this litigation you want to know where

542
00:33:27,879 --> 00:33:29,129
they might have stored

543
00:33:29,129 --> 00:33:32,149
now of course because they've moved
around

544
00:33:32,149 --> 00:33:36,019
and we've all found that one server that
one workgroup used

545
00:33:36,019 --> 00:33:40,859
and you find it like I did once where is
behind a panel she Brock

546
00:33:40,859 --> 00:33:44,559
because he lectures Watson goes it's got
a Mac it's got an apple logo a must be

547
00:33:44,559 --> 00:33:47,349
yours and the police she block away and
there's a

548
00:33:47,349 --> 00:33:50,590
have a workgroup server my

549
00:33:50,590 --> 00:33:55,129
hot it's been sitting there for like by
from three years since she brought this

550
00:33:55,129 --> 00:33:56,389
office

551
00:33:56,389 --> 00:33:59,789
can still live and the worst part is
that

552
00:33:59,789 --> 00:34:04,629
transceiver the AAU why transceivers
blinking said some things hitting this

553
00:34:04,629 --> 00:34:05,830
Mike

554
00:34:05,830 --> 00:34:09,069
I have no idea what the hell the
senate's so of course

555
00:34:09,069 --> 00:34:12,719
I did what you're supposed to do in this
case you on plugging leaks on a Boeing

556
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:13,720
com go

557
00:34:13,720 --> 00:34:20,720
I'm gonna on your machine

558
00:34:21,909 --> 00:34:27,149
Salaam members access to what because I
don't have to be that guy now is the way

559
00:34:27,149 --> 00:34:27,899
to go in

560
00:34:27,899 --> 00:34:31,790
going in growing IT guy but what about
you know is a in a possibly know and

561
00:34:31,790 --> 00:34:32,719
then having them go

562
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:36,960
all there's this theirs is p2

563
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:40,030
that has a drive I don't know what's on
it

564
00:34:40,030 --> 00:34:44,909
where is it hides in a shed but an
internet cable strong two-way

565
00:34:44,909 --> 00:34:48,240
of how the notes to live like its
blinking something setin

566
00:34:48,240 --> 00:34:53,119
I don't know why what could be on it I
don't know but it's kind of like

567
00:34:53,119 --> 00:34:57,339
I one sec who's working part man you
know it's like the same generators a

568
00:34:57,339 --> 00:34:57,970
lost art

569
00:34:57,970 --> 00:35:00,660
I don't know it's on the could be the
document that sings the entire

570
00:35:00,660 --> 00:35:04,890
litigation you find after Discovery's
closed

571
00:35:04,890 --> 00:35:09,129
soap had it not been able to say very
quickly what informational actually

572
00:35:09,130 --> 00:35:11,730
holds you don't have to worry about what
about bad thing up

573
00:35:11,730 --> 00:35:15,200
there's back I can search through all of
our data

574
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:18,540
and anything that doesn't mean the net
searchable zone

575
00:35:18,540 --> 00:35:22,060
is gone how do you know I pounded the
hard drive

576
00:35:22,060 --> 00:35:25,920
flat with a hammer it spendy doused

577
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:30,029
I shot into space separate will worship
but that wouldn't say

578
00:35:30,029 --> 00:35:33,770
all the data we have on this point is
right here

579
00:35:33,770 --> 00:35:37,000
there is no other source yea and you go

580
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:40,310
in go back to your job you don't have to
worry about that really really nice

581
00:35:40,310 --> 00:35:41,319
because the turny

582
00:35:41,319 --> 00:35:44,839
wants to also say cuz the attorneys
going to sign of their evidence as

583
00:35:44,839 --> 00:35:48,839
you can freaking disbarment your I'm
lying

584
00:35:48,839 --> 00:35:52,670
kinda scary to see if they wanna they
won't have the reassurance from you say

585
00:35:52,670 --> 00:35:56,310
everything in bed that we have on point
is here

586
00:35:56,310 --> 00:35:59,759
everything that may have held a day
before

587
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:04,720
was destroyed as per the doctor
retention policy of

588
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:08,609
okay so I talk about this and why it's
important

589
00:36:08,609 --> 00:36:14,540
but the rule is what you don't have may
not hurt you

590
00:36:14,540 --> 00:36:18,390
more there was the emails

591
00:36:18,390 --> 00:36:22,270
that might proof that often case

592
00:36:22,270 --> 00:36:26,839
against you if it's legally gone if you
are allowed to destroy it

593
00:36:26,839 --> 00:36:31,170
you sell con the doctor attention party
doing stuff not but the doctor tension

594
00:36:31,170 --> 00:36:31,990
policy

595
00:36:31,990 --> 00:36:35,099
gets you in shed cell

596
00:36:35,099 --> 00:36:39,430
destruction usually okay

597
00:36:39,430 --> 00:36:42,750
if you don't have some other requirement
to keep that getting a

598
00:36:42,750 --> 00:36:47,160
you don't have some regulatory mood says
you have to hold all this data for two

599
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:48,210
years

600
00:36:48,210 --> 00:36:52,410
arm one of my clients I love them for
public transit authority

601
00:36:52,410 --> 00:36:56,980
they're almost twenty years

602
00:36:56,980 --> 00:37:01,250
good 20 years some this is paper
documents

603
00:37:01,250 --> 00:37:05,549
and they decided well we still hold onto
a pass the doctor pension policy

604
00:37:05,549 --> 00:37:08,890
so we went to the warehouse and it's a
warehouse

605
00:37:08,890 --> 00:37:12,529
filled with document boxes filled with
more room

606
00:37:12,529 --> 00:37:15,740
rats n and good

607
00:37:15,740 --> 00:37:21,200
mom I don't know yet but mimeographed
files remembered your barber

608
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:28,200
on white paper burger this is not this
case was 1953 Yomi come back to us

609
00:37:28,619 --> 00:37:33,000
everyone involved is dead

610
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:36,310
I'm we can shred it yet

611
00:37:36,310 --> 00:37:39,819
the only downer has now is that some
poor schmuck who's got became really

612
00:37:39,819 --> 00:37:41,099
weird train fetish

613
00:37:41,099 --> 00:37:45,609
may want to know about some dough on a
trolley

614
00:37:45,609 --> 00:37:50,598
when Eisenhower was president did

615
00:37:50,599 --> 00:37:53,619
okay so usually okay if you don't have a
plan to keep

616
00:37:53,619 --> 00:37:57,950
you have to keep it if litigation been
filed on this point

617
00:37:57,950 --> 00:38:01,680
are you think it might happen others
regulatory scheme generally that's okay

618
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:02,950
there's one case

619
00:38:02,950 --> 00:38:07,310
thats different where r may be running
10

620
00:38:07,310 --> 00:38:10,420
I don't go too much into a purse
basically complaints about

621
00:38:10,420 --> 00:38:15,049
rifles firing when he didn't pull the
trigger

622
00:38:15,049 --> 00:38:18,450
kinda group them

623
00:38:18,450 --> 00:38:21,670
if you turn the safe be it would fire

624
00:38:21,670 --> 00:38:24,799
which I think that makes the time safety

625
00:38:24,799 --> 00:38:28,700
ugh really YUM

626
00:38:28,700 --> 00:38:31,750
really bad irony that save proud

627
00:38:31,750 --> 00:38:36,480
now it's safe I'm but they had
complaints people britain said I had

628
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:39,770
this problem with your otherwise fine
firearm

629
00:38:39,770 --> 00:38:43,540
and what they did was be read it and
shredded them

630
00:38:43,540 --> 00:38:47,180
so when other people you know went when
it's not a hold that was really scary

631
00:38:47,180 --> 00:38:50,720
when the right for one of the bullish on
handsets like

632
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:54,029
group I ever close pointing at

633
00:38:54,029 --> 00:38:57,710
someone who wasn't dearer you know how
my wife

634
00:38:57,710 --> 00:39:01,299
dressed as a UPS delivery man with white
gloves or something

635
00:39:01,299 --> 00:39:06,520
I'm and they said but we want all the
other complaints in Remington said we

636
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:07,940
don't have any

637
00:39:07,940 --> 00:39:11,460
not been getting we don't have any cuz
we describe the matter doctor

638
00:39:11,460 --> 00:39:14,579
prevention policy we get them with them

639
00:39:14,579 --> 00:39:18,529
fraud 30 days nourish read them it said
wait a minute how many complaints again

640
00:39:18,529 --> 00:39:22,690
we don't know have you had them other
people coming and we're going i

641
00:39:22,690 --> 00:39:26,160
here's a copy the letter I sent my see
you hadn't noticed that this was a

642
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:26,930
problem

643
00:39:26,930 --> 00:39:32,118
going back to the 70s yes but we don't
have the doc because we destroyed them

644
00:39:32,119 --> 00:39:35,369
as per doctor country bars in the course
I'd well

645
00:39:35,369 --> 00:39:40,759
lady Mirlande you should've known dead
you want to destroy needs

646
00:39:40,759 --> 00:39:45,259
sour the other thing you wanna think
about a special electronic scheme

647
00:39:45,259 --> 00:39:50,549
is never create the document in the
first place

648
00:39:50,549 --> 00:39:55,190
I'm thinking about what anonymity if you
want to protect your users

649
00:39:55,190 --> 00:39:58,210
you create a log file about what they've
done and then deleted

650
00:39:58,210 --> 00:40:01,970
that's potentially a problem if you
remember

651
00:40:01,970 --> 00:40:05,440
log information in the first place

652
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:09,450
that may be beneficial cuz then you can
say when you get sued

653
00:40:09,450 --> 00:40:12,560
I don't have that data because I'm never
how did

654
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:19,560
anyway I didn't destroy it I'm never put
it down

655
00:40:21,509 --> 00:40:24,799
I think you can argue that that's
transitory know if it was never really a

656
00:40:24,799 --> 00:40:26,910
document was just weren't there

657
00:40:26,910 --> 00:40:30,259
you needed to prevent transaction but it
went away

658
00:40:30,259 --> 00:40:34,009
I think once you create the document has
invited to desk

659
00:40:34,009 --> 00:40:38,170
in such a way that you need looked at it
especially given how did for anyone

660
00:40:38,170 --> 00:40:41,549
the time and by one per gallon thinkin
human terms

661
00:40:41,549 --> 00:40:44,869
a week a month here then we have a
problem

662
00:40:44,869 --> 00:40:48,829
if it's designed to be in the system in
such a way that its only used for debt

663
00:40:48,829 --> 00:40:49,859
transaction

664
00:40:49,859 --> 00:40:53,799
10 seconds a millisecond whatever broke
a

665
00:40:53,799 --> 00:40:58,450
generally so unnecessary logging
retention

666
00:40:58,450 --> 00:41:01,950
now spoliation this is that this is a a
legal term for

667
00:41:01,950 --> 00:41:05,130
you destroyed staff you shouldn't
perhaps

668
00:41:05,130 --> 00:41:09,859
and we do nasty things to people we
catch doing this

669
00:41:09,859 --> 00:41:14,359
me in this ranges from a sanction as in

670
00:41:14,359 --> 00:41:19,410
you know how to bring the opposing side
is allowed to bring this up in court

671
00:41:19,410 --> 00:41:23,859
that offend them kept the stockings but
the screen is they're trying to hide

672
00:41:23,859 --> 00:41:25,170
something from his you make the

673
00:41:25,170 --> 00:41:28,520
had you're allowed to bring up the
adverse inference that says

674
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:32,369
I eager the defendant says

675
00:41:32,369 --> 00:41:36,450
they've never had any of these documents
but I have proof that they did

676
00:41:36,450 --> 00:41:40,410
which means they must be hiding
something I can bring that up now

677
00:41:40,410 --> 00:41:44,259
too nice it's a nice hard because all
the sand %um the fact that you have no

678
00:41:44,259 --> 00:41:44,890
case

679
00:41:44,890 --> 00:41:48,279
is actually beneficial you get to do the
conspiracy theory

680
00:41:48,279 --> 00:41:52,040
thing i've seen others where cases have
been

681
00:41:52,040 --> 00:41:56,790
dismissed but only I'm suing the sky but
I destroyed all my documents from guess

682
00:41:56,790 --> 00:41:57,560
one

683
00:41:57,560 --> 00:42:02,040
dismissed gone you like ho in did get
clients like worry me

684
00:42:02,040 --> 00:42:05,829
I have no claim now at Gap as you
describe you destroy the necessary

685
00:42:05,829 --> 00:42:06,720
documents

686
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:10,200
this isn't an idea to hold everything
but like the relevant documents once

687
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:12,589
litigations value then destroyed them

688
00:42:12,589 --> 00:42:16,599
you can get spanked for that it usually
depends on how much bad faith is obvious

689
00:42:16,599 --> 00:42:20,740
in a burden destruction like I hope the
evidence

690
00:42:20,740 --> 00:42:24,790
I'll try a car accident more action is
great rock one

691
00:42:24,790 --> 00:42:29,140
on dad truck was all over they believe
it was bad maintenance

692
00:42:29,140 --> 00:42:34,279
the problem is is that later the the
warehouse the truck is stored in burns

693
00:42:34,279 --> 00:42:35,240
down

694
00:42:35,240 --> 00:42:40,009
destroying the evidence and that the
truck manufactured tries to argue to the

695
00:42:40,009 --> 00:42:42,680
owner the truck like what you destroy
the evidence

696
00:42:42,680 --> 00:42:46,060
therefore we should not turn said I was
really bad because you have no control

697
00:42:46,060 --> 00:42:48,049
over the warehouse

698
00:42:48,049 --> 00:42:51,640
warehouses held by a third party not bad
faith

699
00:42:51,640 --> 00:42:54,990
other stuff but the destruction of the
complaint letters to running 10

700
00:42:54,990 --> 00:42:59,660
is in bad faith and Remington got
spanked for after

701
00:42:59,660 --> 00:43:02,740
sanctions okay subpoenas

702
00:43:02,740 --> 00:43:05,960
this is a this is kinda but this is more
interesting is this is that where you

703
00:43:05,960 --> 00:43:07,730
can go to a third party

704
00:43:07,730 --> 00:43:11,200
and say I'm suing be a is suing be

705
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:14,839
but I want information from CE

706
00:43:14,839 --> 00:43:20,119
about be senior with third party in fine
stuff

707
00:43:20,119 --> 00:43:23,690
you can get its issued by court
sometimes my grand jury are violent

708
00:43:23,690 --> 00:43:25,119
again

709
00:43:25,119 --> 00:43:29,950
tops our pain response information same
things we talked about for discovery

710
00:43:29,950 --> 00:43:33,279
it's a major discovery order you can
depend on similar grounds this is

711
00:43:33,279 --> 00:43:37,810
overly burdensome its too much it cost
me too much to give you this data

712
00:43:37,810 --> 00:43:41,440
narrow the scope of

713
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:45,619
ok yes guess they can't but of course

714
00:43:45,619 --> 00:43:50,029
you bill what your rates so i've seen
that's what I guess we demand this

715
00:43:50,029 --> 00:43:53,540
information fine I built two hundred
fifty dollars an hour to do this work

716
00:43:53,540 --> 00:43:57,589
and you before sometimes ago know we
think that date is actually worth it

717
00:43:57,589 --> 00:44:02,910
were paid near like okay well printer

718
00:44:02,910 --> 00:44:08,328
I'm issues have standing down here's
where things get really really fun

719
00:44:08,329 --> 00:44:13,079
you subscribe to a service

720
00:44:13,079 --> 00:44:17,180
bad holds your data

721
00:44:17,180 --> 00:44:20,328
I can go after you I can sue you for
that day your

722
00:44:20,329 --> 00:44:25,000
I can go on for your service sometimes

723
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:29,420
you may not be able to step in separate
embargo after the serbs that holds your

724
00:44:29,420 --> 00:44:31,480
data and you say no no no that's mine
data

725
00:44:31,480 --> 00:44:34,869
there are cases where the quarter said
no it's not

726
00:44:34,869 --> 00:44:39,240
its beta about you but it is not your
data so therefore you had no standing

727
00:44:39,240 --> 00:44:44,750
to file a lawsuit to protect but Batum

728
00:44:44,750 --> 00:44:50,770
so warrants on this is a criminal this
is kinda related I throw this in cuz I

729
00:44:50,770 --> 00:44:52,380
like this park is

730
00:44:52,380 --> 00:44:56,339
I find this is something valuable to
hackers

731
00:44:56,339 --> 00:44:59,470
cross probable cause to be items seized
container are

732
00:44:59,470 --> 00:45:02,790
evidence for instance from counties are
contraband

733
00:45:02,790 --> 00:45:06,430
usually ninety-five percent the time you
do this

734
00:45:06,430 --> 00:45:11,348
has an IP person we're looking for child
porn

735
00:45:11,349 --> 00:45:15,069
out it seems to me there's a that wasn't
the case is I do this is most cases I

736
00:45:15,069 --> 00:45:18,940
red may because people will litigate
child porn stuff

737
00:45:18,940 --> 00:45:24,130
om this is a different standard than
what you need for discovery were

738
00:45:24,130 --> 00:45:26,990
discovered or just there's litigation
filed yet reactor

739
00:45:26,990 --> 00:45:30,460
yet to show that there's some prove
there's some evidence that the data we

740
00:45:30,460 --> 00:45:30,880
want

741
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:33,980
were looking for is out there

742
00:45:33,980 --> 00:45:38,390
and you happen wiretap want this allows
you to put a sniper on a system

743
00:45:38,390 --> 00:45:41,680
probable cause and no alternative mad
science like a higher standard than it

744
00:45:41,680 --> 00:45:43,180
had been a warrant

745
00:45:43,180 --> 00:45:46,598
ok extra Communications Act same thing
its

746
00:45:46,599 --> 00:45:49,779
I same thing is just a regular warrant
you don't have to show that there is no

747
00:45:49,779 --> 00:45:51,560
better alternative

748
00:45:51,560 --> 00:45:54,869
so dealing with warrants this is
something you may have to do special if

749
00:45:54,869 --> 00:45:57,020
you run a data center or the like

750
00:45:57,020 --> 00:46:00,330
her to approach its I like to call them
hopeful

751
00:46:00,330 --> 00:46:03,839
are silent if you are a large
institution say for example

752
00:46:03,839 --> 00:46:09,210
a well you mentioned one person does not
show up to a around say we have a

753
00:46:09,210 --> 00:46:09,759
warrant

754
00:46:09,759 --> 00:46:13,869
it back said because a Wells responses

755
00:46:13,869 --> 00:46:17,230
that looks like a war that sealed okay

756
00:46:17,230 --> 00:46:20,849
how do you want the data DVD thumb drive
good

757
00:46:20,849 --> 00:46:25,330
here you go helpful

758
00:46:25,330 --> 00:46:29,040
the silent helpful so you get the nice
officers what they've won

759
00:46:29,040 --> 00:46:33,239
for so they don't take everything

760
00:46:33,239 --> 00:46:36,910
if they have a blunt they can take
everything that they believe they have

761
00:46:36,910 --> 00:46:38,299
Republic cause

762
00:46:38,299 --> 00:46:41,670
is contraband fruits

763
00:46:41,670 --> 00:46:44,670
evidence are contraband so they could
sell

764
00:46:44,670 --> 00:46:51,420
we're taking everything that stores data
in the data center

765
00:46:51,420 --> 00:46:54,819
most if you want holy shit that despite
my uptime

766
00:46:54,819 --> 00:47:00,009
ok node where's the data center in a
truck

767
00:47:00,009 --> 00:47:04,080
and I've read why I bred want to make a
can stop I didn't thought I didn't think

768
00:47:04,080 --> 00:47:06,580
how better

769
00:47:06,580 --> 00:47:10,640
like I'm not gonna arm anything
electronic like

770
00:47:10,640 --> 00:47:13,890

douchebag them

777
00:47:39,339 --> 00:47:42,430
the problem is when you're hopeful you

778
00:47:42,430 --> 00:47:46,480
when to call you all this stuff haha
second I'll get it for you

00:48:02,500 --> 00:48:05,670
the sign would approach I don't know
nothin about nothin

784
00:48:05,670 --> 00:48:10,750
take it all good you can claim the bad
stuff isn't yours

785
00:48:10,750 --> 00:48:13,750
they may go to prove it another way but
you're not admitting to it

786
00:48:13,750 --> 00:48:18,069
the problem has nothing Sears can take
everything

787
00:48:18,069 --> 00:48:21,339
and the fun part is what happens in

788
00:48:21,339 --> 00:48:25,969
other people store their stuff on your
boxes

789
00:48:25,969 --> 00:48:30,819
when they take the boxer can search the
box not just the target out the original

790
00:48:30,819 --> 00:48:33,410
search warrant

791
00:48:33,410 --> 00:48:37,129
to think about that for a second so want
offenses

792
00:48:37,130 --> 00:48:41,089
legal file suppression motion baton the
warrant was a legal

793
00:48:41,089 --> 00:48:45,339
you gonna take it away after the fact
you can follow suit give us that stuff

794
00:48:45,339 --> 00:48:46,960
back when you're done

795
00:48:46,960 --> 00:48:51,009
please are in civil rights action in
1983 action

796
00:48:51,009 --> 00:48:54,730
technical offsite backups

797
00:48:54,730 --> 00:48:58,839
in a different jurisdiction so you can
go live eventually

798
00:48:58,839 --> 00:49:03,549
mirror sites season go live when you
click when you switch over be an ass

799
00:49:03,549 --> 00:49:09,380
in crowded campaigners so you can say I
didn't know was there all of my clients

800
00:49:09,380 --> 00:49:13,410
bits our customers happen but the
container I don't have and

801
00:49:13,410 --> 00:49:17,930
I don't have the key so you can take I
can be proud I can be mister finally

802
00:49:17,930 --> 00:49:18,399
nope

803
00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:23,799
here's the incredible container that is
the target of that search for him

804
00:49:23,799 --> 00:49:27,200
have been bad but also said that way you
can say

805
00:49:27,200 --> 00:49:32,549
don't take our other stuff I would ban
as how poor as I can be

806
00:49:32,549 --> 00:49:36,230
of I pictured cat

807
00:49:36,230 --> 00:49:40,130
cuz I wanna have to like here's you know
here's here's the nice passive approach

808
00:49:40,130 --> 00:49:41,230
I couldn't find it

809
00:49:41,230 --> 00:49:47,810
picture became being angry Southam

810
00:49:47,810 --> 00:49:50,680
promise I don't have to take a picture
I'm

811
00:49:50,680 --> 00:49:54,009
a transitive trust think about who you
trust

812
00:49:54,010 --> 00:49:57,160
and who they trust and so on the idea is
this

813
00:49:57,160 --> 00:50:00,370
sometimes information attacker once is
involved with places

814
00:50:00,370 --> 00:50:05,799
so where do you go got good soft target
of course

815
00:50:05,800 --> 00:50:09,530
less interest in protecting me film I
has weaker security

816
00:50:09,530 --> 00:50:12,830
same them you maybe

817
00:50:12,830 --> 00:50:16,490
are in Crescent you our wiki leaks see
him

818
00:50:16,490 --> 00:50:21,280
have a spec you have a bunch attorneys
jon benet just to fuck with the system

819
00:50:21,280 --> 00:50:25,510
and back with the man to defend miss far
I am going to have someone is some

820
00:50:25,510 --> 00:50:29,490
if given the same data is on some small
cloud provider that's like

821
00:50:29,490 --> 00:50:33,230
I have got a realist I know where
somewhere

822
00:50:33,230 --> 00:50:36,330
fine don't have the data over they'll
give it up

823
00:50:36,330 --> 00:50:39,580
soda hard armored target the angry one

824
00:50:39,580 --> 00:50:43,230
is gonna it fine the same date as in
another box

825
00:50:43,230 --> 00:50:46,600
sober example one

826
00:50:46,600 --> 00:50:50,170
subpoena card providers have an account
holder the cloud provider

827
00:50:50,170 --> 00:50:55,920
may just give you one it's faster easier
may not even alert the data holder

828
00:50:55,920 --> 00:50:58,990
and as an example people be Harris I
don't wanna go into it

829
00:50:58,990 --> 00:51:03,260
arm but no expectation privacy and we'd
public trough

830
00:51:03,260 --> 00:51:06,570
tweets and the tweets for twenty years
not be on

831
00:51:06,570 --> 00:51:10,840
not create or so therefore you have no
privacy rights and ad

832
00:51:10,840 --> 00:51:15,790
I example number two this is a new
medication

833
00:51:15,790 --> 00:51:19,520
Tucson two companies get into either a
merger and acquisition deal or

834
00:51:19,520 --> 00:51:20,470
litigation

835
00:51:20,470 --> 00:51:24,850
their peak each Olympics debate in hands
of 20 discovery provider that may have

836
00:51:24,850 --> 00:51:25,990
shit secured

837
00:51:25,990 --> 00:51:31,220
I'll as the attacker don't go after the
company with the big InfoSec Department

838
00:51:31,220 --> 00:51:35,280
I don't have to be discovering vendor
which may not even have good physical

839
00:51:35,280 --> 00:51:36,910
security I walk under the

840
00:51:36,910 --> 00:51:40,549
I walk into the the floor grab the data

841
00:51:40,550 --> 00:51:44,210
I've worked when he discovered a vendor
we had no security

842
00:51:44,210 --> 00:51:49,360
you could have walked in and cake and
rights they were DNA evidence bad but

843
00:51:49,360 --> 00:51:50,510
I've noticed this

844
00:51:50,510 --> 00:51:56,100
evidence bags Rep really easy I can grab
the Gator

845
00:51:56,100 --> 00:51:59,990
I'm all that I P walks out the door are
a few people buy stock at the bright

846
00:51:59,990 --> 00:52:00,600
time

847
00:52:00,600 --> 00:52:04,350
however it's going to be okay

848
00:52:04,350 --> 00:52:08,390
soothing picture macadam

849
00:52:08,390 --> 00:52:12,400
what can you do learn how to speak to
the lawyers

850
00:52:12,400 --> 00:52:16,530
in your organization about these
problems how do you want to approach

851
00:52:16,530 --> 00:52:19,240
them so that when you're being proactive
you like what

852
00:52:19,240 --> 00:52:22,570
I think about the security staff more
than you do.

853
00:52:22,570 --> 00:52:28,330
and I would like hope you do your job so
we both protect the organization

854
00:52:28,330 --> 00:52:33,350
educate them about security don't talk
down to them

855
00:52:33,350 --> 00:52:38,150
be their peers to convince them that
this doesn't need to be

856
00:52:38,150 --> 00:52:42,000
outsourced we want someone to be on his
way to hire an outside vendor to search

857
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:42,590
our stuff

858
00:52:42,590 --> 00:52:48,240
fuck I can do that I can do that cheaper
and better and more securely than you

859
00:52:48,240 --> 00:52:51,120
can then you're outside vendor can
design a while the stuff it's

860
00:52:51,120 --> 00:52:58,109
I will happily handle that for you
bratter

861
00:52:58,110 --> 00:53:02,520
what tony has grabbed work what can you
do continued

862
00:53:02,520 --> 00:53:05,830
discovery on its this is we go to
integrate who has

863
00:53:05,830 --> 00:53:10,150
access to what and where the systems are
does that sound familiar

864
00:53:10,150 --> 00:53:14,070
I did he discover a vendor I did he
discover the audits and slide

865
00:53:14,070 --> 00:53:17,590
this could be tapped on the regular
security on

866
00:53:17,590 --> 00:53:21,160
in fact it should be because it's the
same damn thing but because I'm an

867
00:53:21,160 --> 00:53:22,549
attorney I get the bill

868
00:53:22,550 --> 00:53:26,680
some notable because I said it simply
discovery audit not

869
00:53:26,680 --> 00:53:31,890
a regular Security Auditor the ability
to backup everything has the ability to

870
00:53:31,890 --> 00:53:33,210
preserve everything

871
00:53:33,210 --> 00:53:36,980
you don't need a necessary by a special
e-discovery package

872
00:53:36,980 --> 00:53:40,840
which are usually crappy you can just
say I need to grab stuff

873
00:53:40,840 --> 00:53:45,860
I can grab stuff help but the vendors
figure out if they can protect your shit

874
00:53:45,860 --> 00:53:48,910
any questions are kinda card

875
00:53:48,910 --> 00:53:55,910
we have two minutes of be quick moon

876
00:53:56,440 --> 00:54:00,499
so you talked about grad and in the
discovery process

877
00:54:00,499 --> 00:54:03,599
a friend of mine works for the
Department of Justice

878
00:54:03,599 --> 00:54:08,630
antitrust division and in addition to
looking for a tax documents yes

879
00:54:08,630 --> 00:54:13,940
thousands and thousands about wiretaps
from so he has a lot of the enzyme

880
00:54:13,940 --> 00:54:17,460
you know China discovery so what are you
think

881
00:54:17,460 --> 00:54:21,690
is possible when would you like to see
poor on time's cover beetle so we can

882
00:54:21,690 --> 00:54:23,589
stop burning these back some money

883
00:54:23,589 --> 00:54:28,960
am i doing then it's not because my mind
isn't bad I'm

884
00:54:28,960 --> 00:54:32,549
anything it just lets you search
thinking it's just been a

885
00:54:32,549 --> 00:54:36,420
and we think about how to search beat-up
all the time in ways that the

886
00:54:36,420 --> 00:54:37,539
e-discovery vendors

887
00:54:37,539 --> 00:54:41,019
don't what if you miss something

888
00:54:41,019 --> 00:54:44,650
i fuck up every day

889
00:54:44,650 --> 00:54:49,009
now I'm gonna be serious you're not
going to get killed for fucking up

890
00:54:49,009 --> 00:54:51,049
occasionally as long as you meet a
best-effort

891
00:54:51,049 --> 00:54:55,150
of one minute I'll take one more
question

892
00:54:55,150 --> 00:54:58,739
on what about us documents that

893
00:54:58,739 --> 00:55:02,349
need to have longer life spans like
research methods

894
00:55:02,349 --> 00:55:07,759
who are product documentation or being
hold on to it as long as you need to

895
00:55:07,759 --> 00:55:11,499
you have to be able to give it was over
when you've got it and you have to know

896
00:55:11,499 --> 00:55:12,589
that you've got it

897
00:55:12,589 --> 00:55:17,599
I'm it's more that if you're following a
their attention thing that you have to

898
00:55:17,599 --> 00:55:18,339
destroy it

899
00:55:18,339 --> 00:55:24,349
only been I don't think I'm under same
question many

900
00:55:24,349 --> 00:55:27,130
if you entered a retention policy that
says if it's all in the nineteen is

901
00:55:27,130 --> 00:55:27,960
reduced rates

902
00:55:27,960 --> 00:55:31,190
okay and you have this docking in my
cock

903
00:55:31,190 --> 00:55:35,059
notes on a program that you're you prime
need to refer to:

904
00:55:35,059 --> 00:55:39,329
a year down the line when you're
updating at on

905
00:55:39,329 --> 00:55:42,400
have do you can write granular

906
00:55:42,400 --> 00:55:45,900
dis you can write granular I'll passes

907
