1
00:00:00,329 --> 00:00:03,070
on we have is explaining

2
00:00:03,070 --> 00:00:07,190
the CBI and the Internet of Things by a
my neighbor and yours

3
00:00:07,190 --> 00:00:13,990
Travis Goodspeed Antioch

4
00:00:13,990 --> 00:00:18,310
I'm so very eager to learn about
politics or lawyer in the wrong room

5
00:00:18,310 --> 00:00:22,609
and if you'd like to I can include some
even though I don't know any

6
00:00:22,609 --> 00:00:26,550
I'm if you want to keep up to date on
political news

7
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:29,619
and is as lovely Twitter account called
real time alerts him

8
00:00:29,619 --> 00:00:33,480
and its awesome everything they say is
accurate is no political bias

9
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:37,590
and is Canada's de manana getting his
arm and massive

10
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:40,800
angry read tweets you know i mean
they're reporting about how our

11
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:45,370
into germany just floods into fans after
doing think peace agreements

12
00:00:45,370 --> 00:00:48,559
and no one seems to give a shit ads in

13
00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:52,349
our bed I a Tennessee things a bit
differently I'm

14
00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:56,559
and there are lots of people need to
thank in the line

15
00:00:56,559 --> 00:01:01,230
amazingly research this is sorted
condensing at all and giving you

16
00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:05,129
and the ways in which I break a number a
wireless sensors

17
00:01:05,129 --> 00:01:09,490
outward it's called the Internet of
Things is one of these technologies that

18
00:01:09,490 --> 00:01:11,830
has a million different buzz words for
it

19
00:01:11,830 --> 00:01:15,479
none of which are actually is
consistently in the field so

20
00:01:15,479 --> 00:01:19,360
you'll go and and you'll see this
parking sensor

21
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:23,280
were AIM a thermometer on a gas plant

22
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:27,150
or whenever weird thing you can imagine
someone has built in wireless sensor

23
00:01:27,150 --> 00:01:27,729
with that

24
00:01:27,729 --> 00:01:32,750
and they call it the thing that is a
good parking sensor our gas vent

25
00:01:32,750 --> 00:01:35,990
and they don't call it by any consistent
technological name

26
00:01:35,990 --> 00:01:39,259
and the closest would be using the or
now

27
00:01:39,259 --> 00:01:44,430
the lovely sure muscle other I IEEE 802
9/ 11

28
00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:47,799
as I edited at $59.4 bed

29
00:01:47,799 --> 00:01:51,170
all these things get skewed around an
inquest this research

30
00:01:51,170 --> 00:01:54,610
I'll got was never the help from Michael
Azman from

31
00:01:54,610 --> 00:01:57,770
my crash I'll better known as drag on
his the guys started kismet

32
00:01:57,770 --> 00:02:02,460
and his got some news in the researchers
own it's worth looking into

33
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:05,990
I'm and this can be cruel a bit dark
matter

34
00:02:05,990 --> 00:02:10,069
I'm there's all sorts a good neighbors
up there I'm

35
00:02:10,069 --> 00:02:14,140
now when you have things on the internet
you have all these features about them

36
00:02:14,140 --> 00:02:15,239
that we're familiar with

37
00:02:15,239 --> 00:02:18,520
but that if you look at the older videos
that came out

38
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:23,040
Adam was it six months ago they started
streaming detox from

39
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:26,829
the 1994 hope and whether those years
was that

40
00:02:26,830 --> 00:02:29,989
ubiquitous data access didn't exist back
then

41
00:02:29,989 --> 00:02:33,230
and in the nineteen eighty-four talks
they start talking about

42
00:02:33,230 --> 00:02:37,049
down in a disturbing cell phones and
they're doing it by using

43
00:02:37,050 --> 00:02:43,200
a ham radio because that's how primitive
cell phone technology was in 1994

44
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:48,010
and similarly this technology is just
barely beginning to be the

45
00:02:48,010 --> 00:02:51,379
deployed the chips only became available

46
00:02:51,379 --> 00:02:55,489
a 67 years ago and they want to play
until recently

47
00:02:55,489 --> 00:02:59,730
and even then they're getting deployed
in a very ad hoc manner

48
00:02:59,730 --> 00:03:04,090
and so on the internet you've got
everything accessible worldwide

49
00:03:04,090 --> 00:03:07,450
even if not on the inbound and at least
on the outbound like if you own a laptop

50
00:03:07,450 --> 00:03:09,170
is behind a wireless router

51
00:03:09,170 --> 00:03:12,550
the world might not be able to directly
connect to you but you can directly

52
00:03:12,550 --> 00:03:13,489
connect to the world

53
00:03:13,489 --> 00:03:16,629
and not a standard protocols in Anna

54
00:03:16,629 --> 00:03:20,459
I everything seems to be switching to a
running over HTTP

55
00:03:20,459 --> 00:03:23,709
and a few other protocols it is survived
have only done so

56
00:03:23,709 --> 00:03:27,840
because peer to peer were performance
reasons

57
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:31,560
ya sin in this does

58
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:34,739
I M on his internet it but

59
00:03:34,739 --> 00:03:39,780
I understand and equipment I N laptops
and cellphones and arrested that you

60
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:41,680
have very very little variety

61
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:48,319
TCPIP one and I i cant see if you raise
your hands but has anyone here use IPEX

62
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:51,599
SPX in the past sukh okay and

63
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:55,620
many years did this year

64
00:03:55,620 --> 00:04:00,170
did I lose the PDP 11 this year and it
was only for not only say K

65
00:04:00,170 --> 00:04:03,769
and I all those other networking
protocols are just as dead

66
00:04:03,769 --> 00:04:06,879
in modern I am

67
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:11,540
big computers but in little computers
this time around so the United things

68
00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:15,670
we have very low-power radios and very
low-power microcontrollers

69
00:04:15,670 --> 00:04:19,400
and if you choose your battery right
which I did not

70
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:23,280
you get very low on battery life I'm

71
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:27,350
I'm to interview if you have

72
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:30,910
I'm we'll get back to that better

73
00:04:30,910 --> 00:04:34,460
and also the internet things are
infinite diversity and

74
00:04:34,460 --> 00:04:38,320
if you're making something for the
Internet it has to do HTTP

75
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:42,159
and her fast approaching the point where
god forbid it's going to have to speak

76
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:42,820
Facebook

77
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:47,469
I'm I can't wait until it goes the way
of the doc

78
00:04:47,470 --> 00:04:50,770
a dick dot com that's going to be icing
on the cake

79
00:04:50,770 --> 00:04:53,909
and no I know they're already worthless
bed i'd like

80
00:04:53,910 --> 00:04:58,850
the stock market to catch up with that
I'm just for that stock I mean they're

81
00:04:58,850 --> 00:04:59,759
plenty of other things

82
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:03,000
companies actually buildings and help
people

83
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,139
I am make should

84
00:05:06,139 --> 00:05:09,380
yasser make him

85
00:05:09,380 --> 00:05:14,550
limitation and by their protocols is
enforced by who manufactures the chips

86
00:05:14,550 --> 00:05:18,860
and his there are fewer people
manufacturing chips than there are

87
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:22,590
actually building these products silly
even though

88
00:05:22,590 --> 00:05:26,009
every one of these products is designed
as a sort of one are by the firm that

89
00:05:26,009 --> 00:05:27,470
manufactures a

90
00:05:27,470 --> 00:05:32,070
the EU standards chess and that means
that even under a lot of my lair

91
00:05:32,070 --> 00:05:33,320
protocols

92
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:38,349
it's a lot on the order I have 10 or 20
which is manageable ismael

93
00:05:38,350 --> 00:05:42,320
and some days you can promiscuous
listener others you cannot but some you

94
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:43,240
can

95
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:47,810
and and when you step and then you can
figure out the upper layer protocols

96
00:05:47,810 --> 00:05:49,150
yourself

97
00:05:49,150 --> 00:05:53,720
there farm while air two protocols but
these are restricted by a the number

98
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:57,710
library vendors in that if I'm making my
own

99
00:05:57,710 --> 00:06:01,049
wireless sensor network I would probably
use

100
00:06:01,050 --> 00:06:05,610
a library were at least a layer 2
protocol that someone asked about

101
00:06:05,610 --> 00:06:09,160
and then for layer 3 and up everything I
do is going to be

102
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:12,509
awkward and unique and

103
00:06:12,509 --> 00:06:16,800
utterly incompatible with what everyone
else there I'm

104
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:20,360
this is created all sorts in consumer
electronics confusion

105
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:23,789
in the accessories the risk posed to up
for this market so it

106
00:06:23,789 --> 00:06:27,280
for a while it looked as if you would be
able to buy and magic thermostat the

107
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:29,410
could then talk your electric meter

108
00:06:29,410 --> 00:06:33,479
at the problem is that Longmire and
similar companies amazon.com

109
00:06:33,479 --> 00:06:36,560
no one wants to advertise something
that's only going to work

110
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:40,690
in your little slice Eastern Kentucky

111
00:06:40,690 --> 00:06:44,789
so these products never took off their
manufacture they were designed and a lot

112
00:06:44,789 --> 00:06:46,759
of companies lost a lot of money on a

113
00:06:46,759 --> 00:06:50,280
not nearly so much money as a social
networking companies but

114
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:54,060
the still planning I'm and then hardware
is like

115
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:58,770
the badge the came out two years ago and
when I designed this badge

116
00:06:58,770 --> 00:07:02,568
I A began with a protocol that you must
now act design

117
00:07:02,569 --> 00:07:06,419
and I A remote the firmware to run an
amnesty for their teacher

118
00:07:06,419 --> 00:07:09,979
which is more powerful but I use the
same radio and

119
00:07:09,979 --> 00:07:13,068
the two were largely competitor you can
use

120
00:07:13,069 --> 00:07:16,530
the next job ads with the USB attachment
to packets now

121
00:07:16,530 --> 00:07:20,210
militias packets and you can even

122
00:07:20,210 --> 00:07:24,180
ran a lot of compatible devices across
the gym

123
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:27,970
now what you you can't do though is

124
00:07:27,970 --> 00:07:31,380
you can't by looking at the box know
that

125
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:35,009
his technology in mine are roughly the
same thing

126
00:07:35,009 --> 00:07:38,569
you actually have to lift it apart and
read the part numbers you have to know

127
00:07:38,569 --> 00:07:40,900
that they didn't ship is an amnesty for
30

128
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:44,379
yet another little chip is a Nordic RF
radio

129
00:07:44,379 --> 00:07:48,879
and another car radio is also used in
the microsoft wireless keyboards

130
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:52,020
are which is great because they use X

131
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:58,389
ad's very blessed with a terrific I'll
exclusive or

132
00:07:58,389 --> 00:08:03,770
and and the key is something very hard
to find it's the mac Address

133
00:08:03,770 --> 00:08:07,919
show every packet includes the key at
least once by default and mac address

134
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:12,099
and then in a USB keyboard event when
when you have a key up

135
00:08:12,099 --> 00:08:16,229
bag if you press down the letter J then
it sends a list which includes letter J

136
00:08:16,229 --> 00:08:19,280
and a bunch of empty spaces and then
when you key goes up

137
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:22,330
it has the same list without a
latter-day thats

138
00:08:22,330 --> 00:08:27,620
a lot is eras and what happens when you
exclusive or 13 0.00% the

139
00:08:27,620 --> 00:08:30,840
bite bite mac Address

140
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:34,450
and he's back dresses are five bites at
day 8 a night

141
00:08:34,450 --> 00:08:38,159
in the PC world which is standardized
and six in the end they did well that

142
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:39,669
everything is different

143
00:08:39,669 --> 00:08:43,799
and and these radios make it double is
what's called a starter friend a limiter

144
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:48,390
so promiscuously sniffing the keywords
from this badge was a significant

145
00:08:48,390 --> 00:08:49,130
accomplishment

146
00:08:49,130 --> 00:08:54,439
it was not something easier predictable
and soul and

147
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:59,190
and going up attending harrods good
tension when Maximus interest intruder

148
00:08:59,190 --> 00:09:01,920
went to Microsoft and they said hey
we've built this thing called the key

149
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:04,630
creaky which can sniff your wireless
keyboard

150
00:09:04,630 --> 00:09:07,490
microsoft said I'll we don't care
because you need to build custom

151
00:09:07,490 --> 00:09:08,760
hardware

152
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:12,580
album and had a picture this badge in
their stride saying that

153
00:09:12,580 --> 00:09:15,680
you know you cannot use this hard to do
it so

154
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:18,790
I the fix don't care

155
00:09:18,790 --> 00:09:22,829
I'm and all the way into it is that you
have to disable check something and

156
00:09:22,830 --> 00:09:25,450
check the radio and receiving background
nights

157
00:09:25,450 --> 00:09:30,390
and is an article on it called
promiscuity is the NRF 24 L 0-1 classes

158
00:09:30,390 --> 00:09:31,459
duty

159
00:09:31,459 --> 00:09:34,720
I'm and President I like that you'd
never imagine that it's something

160
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:35,779
technical

161
00:09:35,779 --> 00:09:42,089
your act our damnit this is one of those
blogs just thanks to the capture

162
00:09:42,089 --> 00:09:46,279
and this year's there's lurches e1

163
00:09:46,279 --> 00:09:49,910
its by a Spanish company and I'm

164
00:09:49,910 --> 00:09:53,540
I i dun I really like this company it's
a god

165
00:09:53,540 --> 00:09:56,750
I think it's and small

166
00:09:56,750 --> 00:10:00,110
agree but there comes a start up because
the ship the product

167
00:10:00,110 --> 00:10:03,970
and

168
00:10:03,970 --> 00:10:07,970
I E can see it here in this photo I mean
this is a really little second board

169
00:10:07,970 --> 00:10:13,300
on thats a built in a bit could tired in
Iran color forget

170
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:17,000
the there the value in any case

171
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,200
and this contains the essential parts in
it you need

172
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:23,950
eighty microcontroller you near Radio

173
00:10:23,950 --> 00:10:28,110
and you need some you need something to
do

174
00:10:28,110 --> 00:10:31,850
so in this case is a development kit and
the something that you do is your own

175
00:10:31,850 --> 00:10:33,120
responsibility

176
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:37,029
it has little sensor pods the going to
decide seat inside the battery pack 1 it

177
00:10:37,029 --> 00:10:38,160
is pretty by

178
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:41,640
tasting trap and then you know the
temperature by the steam trap

179
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:45,480
which might give you an idea how much
heat is being lost were

180
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:48,779
I whatever else you interested and and
it's usually things like that it's

181
00:10:48,779 --> 00:10:49,579
usually

182
00:10:49,579 --> 00:10:52,640
really industrial things that

183
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:56,510
if you're not part of that industry or
if you're not interested in now

184
00:10:56,510 --> 00:11:00,250
messing with an industry you wanna care
about and

185
00:11:00,250 --> 00:11:04,230
Cerrone even though very few of us care
about steam traps

186
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:08,209
maybe have a reason to care or maybe the
congress possible for a steam trap

187
00:11:08,209 --> 00:11:11,320
were maybe wanna make it look like a.m.

188
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:14,950
unit you know such as such is the in

189
00:11:14,950 --> 00:11:18,029
least energy wasteful building in the
world fraudulently

190
00:11:18,029 --> 00:11:22,029
well this happy developer down

191
00:11:22,029 --> 00:11:25,279
so today I'm going to show you how do
you find the Internet of Things

192
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:28,600
because these networks are local you not
call the Internet of Things is not

193
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:30,700
actually on the Internet

194
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:34,750
and when it's attached its by a gateway
that is largely useless

195
00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:37,870
I but useless for the attacker and

196
00:11:37,870 --> 00:11:40,959
but they the fun part about this lecture
is that on a show you how to extract

197
00:11:40,959 --> 00:11:42,209
keys and firmware

198
00:11:42,209 --> 00:11:46,640
from different types higher energies
customer and I'm going to show it to you

199
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:48,930
in very concrete examples

200
00:11:48,930 --> 00:11:52,220
in the case and exactly how a particular
vendor screwed up

201
00:11:52,220 --> 00:11:55,720
and how that vendors customers have
their

202
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:59,720
their little paper to expose because
this and also their keys

203
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:03,690
I'm the first attacking gonna show you

204
00:12:03,690 --> 00:12:07,459
is against the chocolate chip kahn 2420
and this was

205
00:12:07,459 --> 00:12:10,540
at a very early chip and I love this
chip

206
00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:15,510
it's very reliable I am I M

207
00:12:15,510 --> 00:12:19,100
I recommend this trip to other people
but it doesn't the problem that

208
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:23,829
it does the encryption instead of
allowing the host mission to do it

209
00:12:23,829 --> 00:12:27,589
which is a problem because the keys have
to get into the radio and they come in

210
00:12:27,589 --> 00:12:31,149
through the microcontroller and you can
watch that happen and then you have the

211
00:12:31,149 --> 00:12:32,630
keys

212
00:12:32,630 --> 00:12:38,160
I'm say published a good blog post about
that and actually stepping out using

213
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:42,160
hypodermic syringes now so there's a
lovely boat is a go along with it

214
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:46,139
and this hit wonders his picture
catalogs

215
00:12:46,139 --> 00:12:49,760
and the electric industry found it and i
got really really ticked off

216
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:53,250
and this is the only thing I've ever
gotten hate mail over and that lawsuits

217
00:12:53,250 --> 00:12:56,399
mind you but this was the only time that
I've actually got him out

218
00:12:56,399 --> 00:13:00,040
and I started reading threat and unit

219
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:03,589
its heat now but in that special style
like the marketing guy doing hate mail

220
00:13:03,589 --> 00:13:04,740
to make it look like

221
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:07,750
his product is not vulnerable

222
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:11,519
I'm so when this article came out they
said 0

223
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:14,690
well this is only for the symmetric keys

224
00:13:14,690 --> 00:13:17,880
and now that we have sir com have
approved to the

225
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:21,760
elliptic curve cryptography well he is
out catastrophe in this attack doesn't

226
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:22,920
apply

227
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:25,980
sonic okay how do I break the elliptic
curve cryptography

228
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:29,010
and show the I'm the second

229
00:13:29,010 --> 00:13:33,130
expected I'm gonna show you is on the
check on 24 30 in 25-30

230
00:13:33,130 --> 00:13:36,519
and it shows you how to extract their
liquor keys

231
00:13:36,519 --> 00:13:41,470
alum and then they said well it that
requires physical access and that

232
00:13:41,470 --> 00:13:42,220
doesn't work

233
00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:45,670
in by you can't touch the device and I
said that these are designed to be left

234
00:13:45,670 --> 00:13:47,260
exposed like mister when a

235
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:50,569
manner so

236
00:13:50,570 --> 00:13:56,920
as video in a I'm to the final expect me
to show you is I know how to exploit the

237
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:59,139
badminton number generators that were
used

238
00:13:59,139 --> 00:14:03,220
in every library that uses $this from
incompatible

239
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:07,110
and actually breaks the conductor in the
process so it's possible remotely expect

240
00:14:07,110 --> 00:14:08,170
these keys

241
00:14:08,170 --> 00:14:11,760
album those are the case

242
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:15,360
I'll the Freescale and she won three to
four

243
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:19,360
and this is interesting as it is much
more powerful chips and Jennifer how

244
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:22,850
the electronic ninja badges from the con

245
00:14:22,850 --> 00:14:26,519
at this is what the second electronic
ninja badge used

246
00:14:26,519 --> 00:14:31,690
and and I i like this chip dip but it
hasn't her management issues

247
00:14:31,690 --> 00:14:36,750
in particular if you plug the batteries
in the runway it just won't boot

248
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:40,399
and say show you how to use that to
explain to an extract elements keys and

249
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:42,779
firmware and other credentials

250
00:14:42,779 --> 00:14:46,160
I M do you gotta

251
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:49,839
you've gotta find it well I had a big
mistake agreed your

252
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:53,180
I should be my sides Martin I'm

253
00:14:53,180 --> 00:14:56,870
sylvester nine to discuss the B word
either because you need to find these

254
00:14:56,870 --> 00:14:58,709
devices before you can actually

255
00:14:58,709 --> 00:15:02,230
mess with them at this rate is usually
broadcasting and

256
00:15:02,230 --> 00:15:06,649
as little as a single know what so that
it doesn't go very far

257
00:15:06,649 --> 00:15:13,649
and this photograph was taken in
Knoxville Tennessee

258
00:15:13,810 --> 00:15:17,540
shows for the high-pressure that our

259
00:15:17,540 --> 00:15:21,069
and it at knotsberry neighborly place i
like it

260
00:15:21,070 --> 00:15:25,660
I also Lake guy I don't like how much it
rains

261
00:15:25,660 --> 00:15:28,759
bed yet friendly people and

262
00:15:28,759 --> 00:15:31,740
what are the advantages is that people
drive everywhere so hey let's go we're

263
00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:32,980
driving

264
00:15:32,980 --> 00:15:37,120
our own the equipment that I used
consists I'll on the laughter little

265
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:38,470
Lego box they made

266
00:15:38,470 --> 00:15:43,680
I try to make as many of my ex plates
LEGO DUPLO complain as possible

267
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:48,209
extends it means something

268
00:15:48,209 --> 00:15:52,040
seller you know a guy got those boxes
get such on the top

269
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:55,599
the USB plug is for charging at or for
reprogramming a

270
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:59,310
and then on the right I have my a Nokia
n9

271
00:15:59,310 --> 00:16:02,529
i won it's like a so

272
00:16:02,529 --> 00:16:06,600
a phone that runs as the next thing but
not bad picked other thing

273
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:09,610
so hours the good thing is that you can
write

274
00:16:09,610 --> 00:16:13,089
programs where and you don't have to
recommend other so I wrote a program

275
00:16:13,089 --> 00:16:17,690
that connects to the by boxes that
packet sniffing

276
00:16:17,690 --> 00:16:21,399
and also this is where GPS because don't
have GPS in

277
00:16:21,399 --> 00:16:24,990
an alleged that is that you can hop in
your car you can start driving around

278
00:16:24,990 --> 00:16:28,870
and all you have to do is required where
you got the packet

279
00:16:28,870 --> 00:16:32,130
DPS wise when you got it and

280
00:16:32,130 --> 00:16:35,889
you're good to go so this is the high
ground about

281
00:16:35,889 --> 00:16:38,889
lightbox so do taken out and unfolded

282
00:16:38,889 --> 00:16:43,209
I'm the little blue border and to the
right is the are in 42

283
00:16:43,209 --> 00:16:47,310
it's a really really easy to use
Bluetooth RF com model

284
00:16:47,310 --> 00:16:50,790
said that on the device and I didn't
have to write any budget code

285
00:16:50,790 --> 00:16:55,060
I've got a battery a top huh and then on
the left you've got the

286
00:16:55,060 --> 00:16:58,389
battery charging circuit and the power
button

287
00:16:58,389 --> 00:17:01,250
and power buttons does the switch
minutes which is in the wrong direction

288
00:17:01,250 --> 00:17:02,899
parents kept

289
00:17:02,899 --> 00:17:06,699
and then the Blue Board in the middle is
a wireless sensor network development

290
00:17:06,699 --> 00:17:07,220
kit

291
00:17:07,220 --> 00:17:10,289
there was popular in 1997 as I'm 2007

292
00:17:10,289 --> 00:17:14,510
and this is going to be a lesbian if you
want to get into the hacking

293
00:17:14,510 --> 00:17:18,559
while I'm not been able to find these on
ebay you can usually find

294
00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:21,980
whole words other than at universities

295
00:17:21,980 --> 00:17:26,500
and because the wireless sensor
networking brother on

296
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:29,650
collapse right around nine 2008 unlike

297
00:17:29,650 --> 00:17:32,690
the social networking bubble which I'm
still waiting to pop the

298
00:17:32,690 --> 00:17:36,380
I'm these birds are just everywhere and
no one is doing a search for them said

299
00:17:36,380 --> 00:17:37,660
you ask politely

300
00:17:37,660 --> 00:17:42,340
professor will give you a bunch play
with and then you can also to Colfax

301
00:17:42,340 --> 00:17:47,220
I M and the the torture in the years for
this is called a good bat

302
00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:51,360
and cited added looted support to the
good that framework

303
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:55,350
and poured into good fit firmware to
Ryan on the

304
00:17:55,350 --> 00:18:00,428
killers be and so this is my mother was
originally designed to run on a board

305
00:18:00,429 --> 00:18:01,240
that is my own

306
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:04,690
and I put it to work on the commercially
available hardware and this way I don't

307
00:18:04,690 --> 00:18:06,440
have to do any solder

308
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:09,500
I'm and and the command line

309
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:12,970
all they do is they've got is good for
their mother tells which

310
00:18:12,970 --> 00:18:18,400
serial party is so in the next would be
such downsized TTY USB whenever

311
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:22,120
here I decided to the mac Address a
Bluetooth device

312
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:26,330
and all my command line Python scripts
that are written on my workstation

313
00:18:26,330 --> 00:18:30,490
also run on my farm and this is nifty in
case you find something that you

314
00:18:30,490 --> 00:18:32,559
recognize and you have an expert for

315
00:18:32,559 --> 00:18:35,710
because you can then run directly
directly from the phone without having

316
00:18:35,710 --> 00:18:38,570
to play a laptop

317
00:18:38,570 --> 00:18:42,870
and I also made a kitty Creek apt in
order to ensure that

318
00:18:42,870 --> 00:18:46,220
like when I'm fat fingering the phone I
can

319
00:18:46,220 --> 00:18:51,770
at anything on and started sniffing
without having to use the command-line

320
00:18:51,770 --> 00:18:55,250
and and the app itself is really easy
two years he's even the pictures do not

321
00:18:55,250 --> 00:18:56,980
do compliant

322
00:18:56,980 --> 00:19:01,370
and just connect the device comes a
firmware version and then start

323
00:19:01,370 --> 00:19:04,160
shuffling package back and forth

324
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:09,230
and the end result is exported into
Google's keyhole markup language

325
00:19:09,230 --> 00:19:14,190
album his hear them specifying the
package description and the according to

326
00:19:14,190 --> 00:19:15,530
the placemark

327
00:19:15,530 --> 00:19:19,928
and in a ir I'm sorry I am i doin said
the politics wanna be in his lecture but

328
00:19:19,929 --> 00:19:21,049
I have to point out

329
00:19:21,049 --> 00:19:24,950
that Google is discriminating against me
by not allowing me to have more than a

330
00:19:24,950 --> 00:19:25,890
million records

331
00:19:25,890 --> 00:19:29,419
in a Google Maps database

332
00:19:29,419 --> 00:19:32,590
and you know it it is harassing me out
like that,

333
00:19:32,590 --> 00:19:36,270
I me know it would be okay if they they
don't target

334
00:19:36,270 --> 00:19:39,330
just my project but I'm

335
00:19:39,330 --> 00:19:43,860
I have anyone knows how to make acumen
markup language

336
00:19:43,860 --> 00:19:46,990
thing where the them the

337
00:19:46,990 --> 00:19:50,660
items are grouped and and ripped as you
zoom in an hour so that I don't hit that

338
00:19:50,660 --> 00:19:51,700
million record limit

339
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:55,630
ok very appreciate knowing this and the
result is a map

340
00:19:55,630 --> 00:19:58,900
this is Cumberland Avenue in Knoxville
Tennessee out on

341
00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:02,450
and a I have this map is by having my
regular gig

342
00:20:02,450 --> 00:20:06,440
the application dumped you a text file
in desk and it just keeps a pending to

343
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:07,200
enter

344
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:10,419
so as I go around the country

345
00:20:10,419 --> 00:20:15,100
I get records so on my phone now the
hotel Pennsylvania manhattan is already

346
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:16,750
in my records

347
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:19,750
both from this visit and from prior ones
and then if I A

348
00:20:19,750 --> 00:20:23,390
in Manhattan and I wanna see where
zambia's I like I just wonder until I

349
00:20:23,390 --> 00:20:23,880
find a

350
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:27,890
I'm you'll you'll find it digby in the

351
00:20:27,890 --> 00:20:31,710
I'm the lower floor the conference
although I haven't yet figured I was

352
00:20:31,710 --> 00:20:33,179
doing it is uninhabited

353
00:20:33,179 --> 00:20:37,760
and this is uninterrupted to and you can
tell it on and kept it because

354
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:41,940
you see it stretches zeros out to the
right away from the addresses

355
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:45,950
in as the packet the header is very
short

356
00:20:45,950 --> 00:20:49,679
and in an empty pack and it is the only
thing that is clear text

357
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:53,870
and this is how you can very quickly
distinguish between the two

358
00:20:53,870 --> 00:20:58,030
our own 1221 iran actually find
something work attacking

359
00:20:58,030 --> 00:21:01,039
you need to attacker

360
00:21:01,039 --> 00:21:04,230
and these chips do support security

361
00:21:04,230 --> 00:21:09,570
G it's just that the word not very well
secured because they're not trying to do

362
00:21:09,570 --> 00:21:12,580
anything important they're just trying
to get the checklist

363
00:21:12,580 --> 00:21:17,860
for security feature so the check on
2420 which was also sold as the number

364
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:18,760
twenty four twenty

365
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:23,510
is just a radio this ship does not have
a sea view in a

366
00:21:23,510 --> 00:21:29,129
and that's important because it does
have NAS 128 engine

367
00:21:29,130 --> 00:21:32,710
so the AES 128 he has to get into the
radio somehow

368
00:21:32,710 --> 00:21:36,909
but the radio has nothing that has
turned complete you cannot program the

369
00:21:36,909 --> 00:21:37,909
radio on any

370
00:21:37,909 --> 00:21:41,440
on copper programming language

371
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:44,659
it just has a tiny little state machine
that knows exactly enough to get a pack

372
00:21:44,659 --> 00:21:46,220
it in and get a pack it out

373
00:21:46,220 --> 00:21:50,460
and then in captivity critter I'm and
it's doing this through these file in

374
00:21:50,460 --> 00:21:51,429
file out buffers

375
00:21:51,429 --> 00:21:55,320
and all love this traffickers overheard
the SPI bus

376
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:59,210
with a serial peripheral interface

377
00:21:59,210 --> 00:22:02,320
this is a microphone after the ship
itself

378
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:05,668
and and a particular like this chapter

379
00:22:05,669 --> 00:22:09,630
because you can actually see the
initials the design is in the corner

380
00:22:09,630 --> 00:22:14,159
and and on my Flickr account a few of us
have been trying to identify

381
00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:18,510
who these people are and so far only one
guy has points

382
00:22:18,510 --> 00:22:22,049
I'm guessing that he speaks no region

383
00:22:22,049 --> 00:22:25,539
is I can't figure out how else he would
be able to do for these things

384
00:22:25,539 --> 00:22:30,190
and make each one of these initials and
as a separate initial thing in

385
00:22:30,190 --> 00:22:33,570
on the other side of the chip each one
it is is one of the engineers who worked

386
00:22:33,570 --> 00:22:34,960
on this project

387
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:39,320
and in all their chips and chips which
are part of the guys got great team

388
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:42,899
lawyer and a new project repairman the
revision is something called

389
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:46,850
and very common to find out work like
this

390
00:22:46,850 --> 00:22:50,820
and also if anyone his name is here once
a free beer and buying

391
00:22:50,820 --> 00:22:55,780
in our and this is the same chip that's
on these lectures he won another

392
00:22:55,780 --> 00:22:57,110
development tools

393
00:22:57,110 --> 00:23:00,710
said earlier it's easy to you find these
chips

394
00:23:00,710 --> 00:23:04,400
and then attacked your own hardware
before moving on to something that you

395
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:05,419
worry about breaking

396
00:23:05,419 --> 00:23:10,720
on the SPI bus consists of a chip select
line

397
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:15,130
this is normally hi im and then it drops
below to indicate that a message is

398
00:23:15,130 --> 00:23:16,600
beginning

399
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:20,320
and then you have to data lines and one
clock line

400
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:23,950
the clock line tells you when to
exchange a bed and did

401
00:23:23,950 --> 00:23:27,750
the tricky thing to understand about the
data lines is that they're both

402
00:23:27,750 --> 00:23:31,510
speaking at the exact same time

403
00:23:31,510 --> 00:23:35,110
and that this works out but the meanings

404
00:23:35,110 --> 00:23:38,450
are assorted delayed by a bite because
you can't do anything about data that

405
00:23:38,450 --> 00:23:41,700
you haven't yet interpreted and you
can't interpreted until it is finished

406
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:42,840
being transmitted

407
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:46,439
serra usually the first bite from a
slave to the master

408
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:49,610
is a status by and that tells the master

409
00:23:49,610 --> 00:23:54,260
whether or not say a package is waiting
in the queue wired the radio has

410
00:23:54,260 --> 00:23:55,450
finished retuning

411
00:23:55,450 --> 00:23:59,929
each one is better has a single meanings
of the mascot of you can figure out

412
00:23:59,929 --> 00:24:04,730
what state the radio is a on because
this is a physical chip

413
00:24:04,730 --> 00:24:08,370
on a physical bored you can use these
lovely things called syringes to

414
00:24:08,370 --> 00:24:12,490
stick in the board to actually watch
this communication

415
00:24:12,490 --> 00:24:15,630
on this is a picture a single syringe

416
00:24:15,630 --> 00:24:21,029
just a step and he looked very carefully
to see the sort of overall that runs

417
00:24:21,029 --> 00:24:23,270
around the Enders orange

418
00:24:23,270 --> 00:24:26,650
rebuild these circles and heading is the
is there

419
00:24:26,650 --> 00:24:30,350
very very small and you need not one

420
00:24:30,350 --> 00:24:34,880
but for syringes at the same time in
order to get a clean reading

421
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:38,179
so im because you've got a cap everyone
in his lines

422
00:24:38,179 --> 00:24:42,169
if you don't get the chip select line
and even kinda makes entered bytes

423
00:24:42,169 --> 00:24:46,350
but not by machine requires a human
operator to tell when one bite begins in

424
00:24:46,350 --> 00:24:47,080
the next Dan's

425
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:50,629
so on the only reliable way to do it

426
00:24:50,630 --> 00:24:54,659
balls for strangers and you actually
have to learn to sit there

427
00:24:54,659 --> 00:24:59,179
your hand in this weird can't Wednesday
in holding the top savalas the

428
00:24:59,179 --> 00:25:03,210
needles while your other hand let the
power switch

429
00:25:03,210 --> 00:25:06,940
and then click the mouse in order to get
softer to read

430
00:25:06,940 --> 00:25:13,260
on this is the clock looks like it idles
low and then jumps high for every dead

431
00:25:13,260 --> 00:25:16,690
and this is what the data lines look
like am

432
00:25:16,690 --> 00:25:19,820
sometimes they ido high sometimes they
aren't alone

433
00:25:19,820 --> 00:25:24,658
sometimes they will idle high but
dropped low when the chip is elected

434
00:25:24,659 --> 00:25:28,100
and which does make it easier prize if
you only have three needles

435
00:25:28,100 --> 00:25:32,299
and you mean to actually have a scope
for logic analyzer and watch these go

436
00:25:32,299 --> 00:25:33,929
across to understand

437
00:25:33,929 --> 00:25:37,289
what's going on inside the board
otherwise there's a massive attack

438
00:25:37,289 --> 00:25:40,669
surface that you're missing

439
00:25:40,669 --> 00:25:44,270
on and then you can use an application
is def it

440
00:25:44,270 --> 00:25:48,010
and this is called the telophase beagle
data center

441
00:25:48,010 --> 00:25:52,539
they've got good support for Mac Linux
and Windows there's also this a logic

442
00:25:52,539 --> 00:25:53,460
analyzer

443
00:25:53,460 --> 00:25:58,299
which is smaller more portable and easy
to use

444
00:25:58,299 --> 00:26:02,470
unfortunately the salient doesn't give
you any live recordings

445
00:26:02,470 --> 00:26:06,970
it only records things and gives you the
complete recording after the fact

446
00:26:06,970 --> 00:26:10,669
so for portability go at the sale /a
release them both in your lab

447
00:26:10,669 --> 00:26:13,720
but if you're in a live alone even
though this device

448
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:18,110
is SBI specific this device just does

449
00:26:18,110 --> 00:26:21,580
SBI sniffing and it's sorta im

450
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:25,309
advantageous to have a dedicated SBI's
differ in addition to your logic

451
00:26:25,309 --> 00:26:26,870
analyzer

452
00:26:26,870 --> 00:26:30,409
on now day

453
00:26:30,409 --> 00:26:33,600
the down the packet capture that you got
here

454
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:37,070
is the the center packets between the
host and

455
00:26:37,070 --> 00:26:43,658
the radio and alumni we'll see commands
to reach into different frequencies

456
00:26:43,659 --> 00:26:46,809
well great legacy the channel hopping
pattern see then there with you

457
00:26:46,809 --> 00:26:50,340
businesses to step on with the radio and
in which water

458
00:26:50,340 --> 00:26:54,080
and if you lose your connection to the
network you know which tends to move to

459
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:57,428
you'll also see this lovely little handy
command

460
00:26:57,429 --> 00:27:01,130
it says right the following 128 bits

461
00:27:01,130 --> 00:27:06,020
to as: keys ear

462
00:27:06,020 --> 00:27:10,150
it actually says that and the following
128 beds

463
00:27:10,150 --> 00:27:14,860
I heard the Saturday asking and at all
that you need to step back as involving

464
00:27:14,860 --> 00:27:16,460
that never criticism

465
00:27:16,460 --> 00:27:20,380
on to get around this

466
00:27:20,380 --> 00:27:24,570
the i'm aware. committee minded

467
00:27:24,570 --> 00:27:30,370
area is decided cue have a unique key
for every single device on the network

468
00:27:30,370 --> 00:27:34,480
and then let the network coordinator
which is there gonna router

469
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:37,510
actually switch between the different
keys on

470
00:27:37,510 --> 00:27:41,520
if this sounds confusing it's because it
is and it causes cancer problems

471
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:45,580
and quite often you'll find one device
that just doesn't behave well with this

472
00:27:45,580 --> 00:27:49,120
so they will either switch back to a
single key for everyone

473
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:52,570
ordered a well-known our

474
00:27:52,570 --> 00:27:58,490
just not bother and they've cryptography
of I M

475
00:27:58,490 --> 00:28:01,870
the other nifty thing is that they've
got get the key somehow

476
00:28:01,870 --> 00:28:05,020
and its either held inside the device

477
00:28:05,020 --> 00:28:09,510
where it's exchanged over the network
and public key cryptography is hard

478
00:28:09,510 --> 00:28:13,500
so as a show you later in this lecture
they screw it up and

479
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:16,830
soon it's a lot easier to shelve key
over

480
00:28:16,830 --> 00:28:21,520
cell and Josh Wright was coming out with
the a.m.

481
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:25,029
the Kennedy

482
00:28:25,029 --> 00:28:28,409
yeah I was going out with Kelly be he
actually

483
00:28:28,409 --> 00:28:31,679
added that if the feature the disorder
lessons for the key to come across a

484
00:28:31,679 --> 00:28:34,279
network and then let that happen to the
register and then hey it's out there

485
00:28:34,279 --> 00:28:35,429
text

486
00:28:35,429 --> 00:28:38,909
because they need to get in and is it
was raised as broadcast over the network

487
00:28:38,909 --> 00:28:40,120
during Association

488
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:43,399
and that's a big ok I'm

489
00:28:43,399 --> 00:28:47,429
let their except as a synonym someone
somewhere has made a goodbye as a

490
00:28:47,429 --> 00:28:48,090
network

491
00:28:48,090 --> 00:28:52,630
all I'm saying is I'm never seen one and
I kinda broke I'm

492
00:28:52,630 --> 00:28:57,590
now our the second revision unless there
is a recognized that they needed some

493
00:28:57,590 --> 00:28:59,000
form of protection but they didn't

494
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:02,059
at it because they're worried about
network protection they added that

495
00:29:02,059 --> 00:29:02,928
because

496
00:29:02,929 --> 00:29:06,570
they were worried about the extraction a
firmware

497
00:29:06,570 --> 00:29:12,970
in the desktop world if I copy your
commercial software directly

498
00:29:12,970 --> 00:29:15,970
what has your logo on it and it has your
branding on it

499
00:29:15,970 --> 00:29:21,020
and it's terribly embarrassing and it
easy to create an advertiser

500
00:29:21,020 --> 00:29:26,600
in the embedded world if I just directly
rep of your embedded system

501
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:31,289
you might never know because there
aren't that many people looking at the

502
00:29:31,289 --> 00:29:33,309
coder talking to the computer directly

503
00:29:33,309 --> 00:29:38,830
selling embedded system chip
manufacturers when they've got a cpl

504
00:29:38,830 --> 00:29:42,000
they add a lock to it which is intended
to you

505
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:45,720
keep done neighbors like me from reading
Yorker

506
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:49,480
and whether this is to keep me from
copying your code it order

507
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:53,120
keep me from figuring out that you
copied someone else's code well that's

508
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:55,539
none of their business they help us

509
00:29:55,539 --> 00:29:58,539
now im so

510
00:29:58,539 --> 00:30:03,429
the check on 2430 in 25-30 they support
a lock

511
00:30:03,429 --> 00:30:08,679
and they have no external SPI bus for
the radio because the radio and the CPU

512
00:30:08,679 --> 00:30:11,960
are on the same piece of silicon

513
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:16,740
and is locked thats prevent you from
just politely asking for a copy the

514
00:30:16,740 --> 00:30:17,610
firmer

515
00:30:17,610 --> 00:30:21,760
where the key they're going to show you
how to get the key

516
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:25,629
getting the firmware is more difficult
and we'll get to that in the a.m

517
00:30:25,630 --> 00:30:31,409
subsequent ship this is a microphone a
graph the check on 25 30

518
00:30:31,409 --> 00:30:35,970
and and this is the good bad its AJ to
give other than I began because

519
00:30:35,970 --> 00:30:39,870
I'll is a good paying a hundred bucks
apiece for gtech to backers when I was

520
00:30:39,870 --> 00:30:41,240
just in

521
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:45,450
and as you want it is you can order PCB
from aim

522
00:30:45,450 --> 00:30:49,490
all the code all the hardware everything
is open source

523
00:30:49,490 --> 00:30:54,240
and you can just build it and then the
bugs and Jess you might have to write

524
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:57,169
your own driver for it %uh because this
isn't trying to do all the work for you

525
00:30:57,169 --> 00:31:00,519
it's just trying to give you a way to
touch these chips

526
00:31:00,519 --> 00:31:03,960
from hyper so I read an article

527
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:08,269
on how the debugging protocol these
chips works

528
00:31:08,269 --> 00:31:11,460
and these are the waveforms date you
produce

529
00:31:11,460 --> 00:31:16,100
in order to and and turn the chip into
backing out so

530
00:31:16,100 --> 00:31:19,140
these reset line and there is at Lima is

531
00:31:19,140 --> 00:31:23,019
higher while the chip is running so you
drop it low

532
00:31:23,019 --> 00:31:26,309
and then before raising at you need to
send to clock pulses

533
00:31:26,309 --> 00:31:30,629
on the debug cockell I'm and he do that
and a bag was running

534
00:31:30,630 --> 00:31:35,720
and to have the Pens become different
pens they become the pens to give you

535
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:39,570
debugging access to the chapter on

536
00:31:39,570 --> 00:31:44,250
and is the actual protocol is almost the
same as SP I accept that you have one

537
00:31:44,250 --> 00:31:46,429
data line instead of two

538
00:31:46,429 --> 00:31:49,510
and and the two parties actually take
turns riding on it

539
00:31:49,510 --> 00:31:52,669
you need to be careful the government to
crack play or you will both try to speak

540
00:31:52,669 --> 00:31:53,980
at the same time

541
00:31:53,980 --> 00:31:58,860
and such by that doesn't break anything
it becomes very difficult to debug

542
00:31:58,860 --> 00:32:01,899
on so after road

543
00:32:01,899 --> 00:32:05,360
a driver for this you can just plugging
into it

544
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:09,610
commercial device and this is that way
from a town called the

545
00:32:09,610 --> 00:32:14,100
felt like I M E inset text messaging 12
for preteen girls

546
00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:18,830
a.m. as you'll see in tomorrow's lecture
on p25

547
00:32:18,830 --> 00:32:22,129
by madly his senate like myself Andrea

548
00:32:22,130 --> 00:32:28,130
actually have these things reflexively
jamming police radios

549
00:32:28,130 --> 00:32:31,669
I'm this screenshot is not a reflexive
jamming

550
00:32:31,669 --> 00:32:35,669
minimize is just consistently jamming at

551
00:32:35,669 --> 00:32:38,950
440 megahertz and

552
00:32:38,950 --> 00:32:42,870
I in the the foreground you see my
terminal for talking

553
00:32:42,870 --> 00:32:46,830
to be I am and in the background check
to see the toy itself

554
00:32:46,830 --> 00:32:50,350
but the their rules to the locker

555
00:32:50,350 --> 00:32:54,049
right and that this is great if you want
to build something call out in that way

556
00:32:54,049 --> 00:32:58,000
I wanna attention is a part mister but
it's not enough to actually break a

557
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,340
product that uses the chip

558
00:32:59,340 --> 00:33:02,470
because you need keys where

559
00:33:02,470 --> 00:33:06,350
color Jim we've got thirty mugger

560
00:33:06,350 --> 00:33:10,000
but our target is locked like everyone
is I am is that ships

561
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:14,210
is actually in a locked state as it
ships and when you connect

562
00:33:14,210 --> 00:33:18,630
the debugger to it you have to erase

563
00:33:18,630 --> 00:33:22,620
the heat wave firmware from it before
you can

564
00:33:22,620 --> 00:33:26,240
do your own thing whether 72 unlock it

565
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:29,580
and is actually really in easy solution
they came up with that

566
00:33:29,580 --> 00:33:33,779
almost everyone in the industry is and
that is that if indeed chip is locked

567
00:33:33,779 --> 00:33:38,890
you are not allowed to do anything
tricky weather until you erase it

568
00:33:38,890 --> 00:33:42,539
and the actively raising at also unlock
sim

569
00:33:42,539 --> 00:33:46,120
on dampening lies that if

570
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:49,890
you erase the chapter then there's
nothing left for you to steal

571
00:33:49,890 --> 00:33:54,149
which is a almost correct

572
00:33:54,149 --> 00:33:58,350
at because when we're a citroën racing
flash

573
00:33:58,350 --> 00:34:02,500
rally racing at the code we're not a
racing RAM

574
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:08,040
which is the data so-called it also
works his ass rammed if you don't remove

575
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:10,168
power from the victim

576
00:34:10,168 --> 00:34:14,149
so you can actually just erase all in
flash memory

577
00:34:14,149 --> 00:34:17,969
and then that you can copy the data
memory out your hard disk

578
00:34:17,970 --> 00:34:23,159
and they have a copy the data member the
ass man survives

579
00:34:23,159 --> 00:34:27,859
said when it gets what works is that you
connect your debugger up to the tiger

580
00:34:27,859 --> 00:34:33,460
you verify its model number and it's
locked state

581
00:34:33,460 --> 00:34:36,980
and then it you unlock the chip by
raising its flash

582
00:34:36,980 --> 00:34:40,609
and then you copy the s RAM out a bit

583
00:34:40,609 --> 00:34:44,328
to your desk and then search the ass
rammed for the network keys

584
00:34:44,329 --> 00:34:47,440
or certificates and I particularly like
certificates because

585
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:51,940
they have they headers you know that
begin privatizing key here

586
00:34:51,940 --> 00:34:57,119
well bank said

587
00:34:57,119 --> 00:35:00,530
and they they the firmware will

588
00:35:00,530 --> 00:35:05,030
as its beginning you know when you're
learning C you learn it on the airline

589
00:35:05,030 --> 00:35:06,170
I'm in Mission

590
00:35:06,170 --> 00:35:09,140
and environmental mission that when
you're writing a program for say this

591
00:35:09,140 --> 00:35:10,029
laptop

592
00:35:10,030 --> 00:35:14,050
there's no real difference between your
coordinator

593
00:35:14,050 --> 00:35:17,760
and when you run your program the
program gets copied in Iran and its run

594
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:18,640
from RAM

595
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:21,759
this is a harvard machine

596
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:26,820
the code and the data are physically
separate you use different

597
00:35:26,820 --> 00:35:32,680
assembly language instructions to access
them so when you use the C compiler

598
00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:36,410
you actually have two different types of
pointers you have pointers to code

599
00:35:36,410 --> 00:35:39,730
memory and plans today to memory

600
00:35:39,730 --> 00:35:43,420
and the same point I will mean different
things with these different memories

601
00:35:43,420 --> 00:35:46,810
and they don't always overlap sewn

602
00:35:46,810 --> 00:35:50,240
if you do a reading from a planner

603
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:54,810
as a C programmer you expect always get
the same word

604
00:35:54,810 --> 00:35:59,730
but inside the this chapter it depends
upon many dereference it as a pointer to

605
00:35:59,730 --> 00:36:02,430
code memory are pointed to data member

606
00:36:02,430 --> 00:36:06,410
another that is passed in a function
call and no one wants to have to explain

607
00:36:06,410 --> 00:36:07,319
s

608
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:11,470
to I'll beginning C++ programmer

609
00:36:11,470 --> 00:36:15,220
so the solution is that in their
libraries the copy all the keys out a

610
00:36:15,220 --> 00:36:18,260
flash memory and in today remember

611
00:36:18,260 --> 00:36:23,109
so they're actually two places to get a
copy editor

612
00:36:23,109 --> 00:36:27,180
this is a a screenshot the ASA the
vulnerability test running

613
00:36:27,180 --> 00:36:31,368
this is Adam just as a shell script
thats

614
00:36:31,369 --> 00:36:35,400
does the signs the sequence and actually
pauses and tells you what it's doing

615
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:38,790
it first write something non-random into
did American

616
00:36:38,790 --> 00:36:43,310
and then it done to back out so it's got
a copy that can look at later

617
00:36:43,310 --> 00:36:48,029
and then enter races but it lacks the
chapter and then it erases the contents

618
00:36:48,030 --> 00:36:49,230
memory

619
00:36:49,230 --> 00:36:53,950
by the chip erase instruction and then
it comes a second time and then it

620
00:36:53,950 --> 00:36:55,170
compares them

621
00:36:55,170 --> 00:36:58,230
you can see here too in the same

622
00:36:58,230 --> 00:37:02,119
and to catch in steel certificates Inc
is this way

623
00:37:02,119 --> 00:37:07,470
and this is terribly handy and lotsa
chip designs make the same mistake

624
00:37:07,470 --> 00:37:11,030
because they thought that only the code
memory was worth protecting

625
00:37:11,030 --> 00:37:14,630
because that to the customers are
worried about if you go back to the girl

626
00:37:14,630 --> 00:37:15,650
to guy and me

627
00:37:15,650 --> 00:37:19,119
jump back resides and so this is the toy
and a prime

628
00:37:19,119 --> 00:37:22,900
right has got a big clash logo on the
the girl tech logo on the side and all

629
00:37:22,900 --> 00:37:23,790
that stuff

630
00:37:23,790 --> 00:37:28,890
down and its manufactured in two
different factors

631
00:37:28,890 --> 00:37:32,259
even though there is no strict need for
it and the reason why

632
00:37:32,260 --> 00:37:36,250
is that too many factories I scared to
death

633
00:37:36,250 --> 00:37:39,800
they will go to a major customer and say
toys R Us

634
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:43,839
they hate toys R Us would you like to
buy 200,000 her

635
00:37:43,839 --> 00:37:48,170
however many other countries are goodbye
million don't think I am its

636
00:37:48,170 --> 00:37:52,930
like that absolute worst nightmares for
the Toys R Us representative to say I'd

637
00:37:52,930 --> 00:37:56,470
love to but I already bought them

638
00:37:56,470 --> 00:37:59,810
and that's what can happen when the
battery runs I was gonna cuz shift

639
00:37:59,810 --> 00:38:03,630
and the relaxed a unit of the line
without approval

640
00:38:03,630 --> 00:38:07,099
but the same time you've got to give the
factory everything necessary to

641
00:38:07,099 --> 00:38:09,320
manufacture your product

642
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:12,940
so when they're running this product of
on

643
00:38:12,940 --> 00:38:16,700
if you look at the design these pens at
the bottom

644
00:38:16,700 --> 00:38:20,040
the ones that i sat in the wires Tim
those are actually exposed

645
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:24,589
they need the batter and %um replace
batteries analyzes a very often see a

646
00:38:24,589 --> 00:38:26,320
relative tens

647
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:30,980
those are the bugging connectors and
that is so that the first factory

648
00:38:30,980 --> 00:38:34,829
programs in a test case in this test
case

649
00:38:34,829 --> 00:38:39,430
is never actually sellable the children
because no one wants to see the thing

650
00:38:39,430 --> 00:38:40,129
budak

651
00:38:40,130 --> 00:38:43,170
and say here test completed

652
00:38:43,170 --> 00:38:46,780
they they've been arrested as ever

653
00:38:46,780 --> 00:38:51,280
your serra the best factory produces
that and then a second factory which has

654
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:53,060
not in the manufacturing

655
00:38:53,060 --> 00:38:58,710
files another the asthmatic diagrams
another the debugging information and

656
00:38:58,710 --> 00:39:01,850
none that no electronics manufacturing
capability whatsoever

657
00:39:01,850 --> 00:39:06,400
they have a Serie I guess is a tables
match people are doing nothing but

658
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:08,180
playing in a programming connector

659
00:39:08,180 --> 00:39:11,220
reflashing the device to make a toy in
and then again on

660
00:39:11,220 --> 00:39:15,180
and if you do that you can prevent
casual men Iran's

661
00:39:15,180 --> 00:39:18,850
and it's still possible to configure
products quest but its

662
00:39:18,850 --> 00:39:25,060
harder for your individual factory to do
it and then

663
00:39:25,060 --> 00:39:28,410
keep in mind that in embedded systems
that's the sword the

664
00:39:28,410 --> 00:39:31,690
attacked that these manufacturers are
most worried about that the vast

665
00:39:31,690 --> 00:39:33,420
majority of them don't give a damn about

666
00:39:33,420 --> 00:39:37,790
down my gaining access to these networks
because and this is something

667
00:39:37,790 --> 00:39:41,040
both that economic money offer

668
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:45,420
and something that's very important stay
up than know what's the harm

669
00:39:45,420 --> 00:39:48,700
I'm sister

670
00:39:48,700 --> 00:39:53,290
the Freescale MC 1324 am

671
00:39:53,290 --> 00:39:56,710
this board is ad bag and Mariana lol
there

672
00:39:56,710 --> 00:40:02,420
and bad with names but he makes these
nifty goal boards for

673
00:40:02,420 --> 00:40:06,460
microcontroller radio development on the
left there's an FTDI chip

674
00:40:06,460 --> 00:40:11,030
which implement a debugger it's the
equivalent of my god that work

675
00:40:11,030 --> 00:40:14,560
and on the right there is a team

676
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:18,620
trees gallantly 1324 and that

677
00:40:18,620 --> 00:40:23,109
is a system on package device which is
different from system-on-chip

678
00:40:23,110 --> 00:40:26,440
and I get back to that Eminem now

679
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:30,590
inside idolize you have a 32-bit ARM
processor

680
00:40:30,590 --> 00:40:34,810
which is a great thing at times about
our and it's got higher accelerated

681
00:40:34,810 --> 00:40:36,860
computer free and all that is internal

682
00:40:36,860 --> 00:40:40,200
you've got all these fancy features
whatever weird thing you want this chip

683
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:40,740
might do

684
00:40:40,740 --> 00:40:44,030
and it's really easy to develop where
and

685
00:40:44,030 --> 00:40:48,190
I wish I could zoom in here but no one
is made presentations of credits good

686
00:40:48,190 --> 00:40:54,110
at home that matter

687
00:40:54,110 --> 00:40:57,320
Yetter now worker I'm

688
00:40:57,320 --> 00:41:02,300
well I a shed I should men that no one's
made

689
00:41:02,300 --> 00:41:06,060
software that's good for presenting that
you don't meet an App Store

690
00:41:06,060 --> 00:41:09,299
account for even a paid for and against
I

691
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:13,140
if I could zoom in on here you would see
the between the chip the radio chip and

692
00:41:13,140 --> 00:41:13,720
the antenna

693
00:41:13,720 --> 00:41:17,680
there's just one component and

694
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:20,940
on almost all the others there's tons is
a giant

695
00:41:20,940 --> 00:41:24,180
to analog radio chain and it has

696
00:41:24,180 --> 00:41:28,009
also its values that have to be
carefully calibrated and

697
00:41:28,010 --> 00:41:31,160
there is waiting to hear is because
Chris Gayle to care that

698
00:41:31,160 --> 00:41:34,960
for you and as a letter as an electrical
engineer that

699
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:39,640
really nice because it thank less
recommended him

700
00:41:39,640 --> 00:41:44,100
but as usual there's a problem down

701
00:41:44,100 --> 00:41:47,590
now they also go by this method that

702
00:41:47,590 --> 00:41:52,960
down if the chip is locked you not
allowed access animasi eraser

703
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:57,460
but they do in a slightly different way
their way is that the chip begins

704
00:41:57,460 --> 00:42:02,540
in a locked state and it boots up

705
00:42:02,540 --> 00:42:06,820
locked if the first four bytes whenever
it is booting from

706
00:42:06,820 --> 00:42:10,700
are lol seek n

707
00:42:10,700 --> 00:42:14,100
and as NASCAR this is a 32-bit ASCII
string

708
00:42:14,100 --> 00:42:18,290
I M St bag no I

709
00:42:18,290 --> 00:42:22,880
Casey lol does not work here down

710
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:26,110
no the chip birds in a and unlocked
stayed

711
00:42:26,110 --> 00:42:32,040
if the first provides our okok it will
stop

712
00:42:32,040 --> 00:42:35,470
and it will unlock itself if anything
else is red

713
00:42:35,470 --> 00:42:39,080
from the press for bikes them now

714
00:42:39,080 --> 00:42:42,549
when the this is flash memory so
interest it erases

715
00:42:42,550 --> 00:42:46,020
to I'll all one's so it become

716
00:42:46,020 --> 00:42:51,040
like 32 bit about us and display when
the chip

717
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:54,050
is freshly program perfect specially
raised

718
00:42:54,050 --> 00:42:58,390
it knows not to try to put itself almost
Baxter

719
00:42:58,390 --> 00:43:01,470
on if you take the lead of the chapter

720
00:43:01,470 --> 00:43:06,890
this is the big square chip berlet
removed using my teenager gas n

721
00:43:06,890 --> 00:43:09,990
I'm I'm lovely things you know

722
00:43:09,990 --> 00:43:13,690
better watch out because it's tough to
turn your fingers lol

723
00:43:13,690 --> 00:43:20,050
and that's awkward so all these will
gold wires that are running

724
00:43:20,050 --> 00:43:23,290
often the the chips those are bonding
wires

725
00:43:23,290 --> 00:43:27,670
and usually when you take when you take
it apart you have those wires running

726
00:43:27,670 --> 00:43:29,250
from the chip Dina Center

727
00:43:29,250 --> 00:43:34,690
out to the legs are the chip which are
on the side but in this chapter

728
00:43:34,690 --> 00:43:38,280
there under each other the rent you
little passive components these other

729
00:43:38,280 --> 00:43:40,770
these other components in this types of
things that you would put on the circuit

730
00:43:40,770 --> 00:43:42,180
board and that the

731
00:43:42,180 --> 00:43:46,089
where do you see the bottom well that's
a circuit board and what they did was

732
00:43:46,090 --> 00:43:50,480
biggest make a small circuit board with
three chips on

733
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:53,680
and then they put a bunch a party over
it now becomes

734
00:43:53,680 --> 00:43:57,950
as in the package this is the name shipp

735
00:43:57,950 --> 00:44:01,220
on the left you have your I'm 7 2 p.m.

736
00:44:01,220 --> 00:44:04,940
and this is what software runs on on the
right

737
00:44:04,940 --> 00:44:09,040
you have the radio regions and you can
recognize the many regions because it

738
00:44:09,040 --> 00:44:10,390
does is on

739
00:44:10,390 --> 00:44:13,900
a column lollipops but engineers tell me
that there are doctors

740
00:44:13,900 --> 00:44:17,160
a over underwriter

741
00:44:17,160 --> 00:44:20,790
and viewed these lollipops always
indicate the radio said you got xx

742
00:44:20,790 --> 00:44:22,160
Jepsen which was the radio

743
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:25,170
it's always on the lollipops

744
00:44:25,170 --> 00:44:30,950
this one here with the dunk on top this
is the flash memory chip

745
00:44:30,950 --> 00:44:34,340
and again the dunk on top cuz its by
faster richer

746
00:44:34,340 --> 00:44:38,970
and these are the three with all the
other country moved in you can actually

747
00:44:38,970 --> 00:44:39,870
see the

748
00:44:39,870 --> 00:44:44,580
and the fibers in the fiberglass
minnesota New woman between each other

749
00:44:44,580 --> 00:44:50,090
I'm and it the thing is dead this chip
here

750
00:44:50,090 --> 00:44:54,190
disappear this is not have any flash
memory

751
00:44:54,190 --> 00:44:58,700
I in fact any non-volatile memory up any
kind

752
00:44:58,700 --> 00:45:03,980
sylmar they need to add it and they did
it by the second chapter

753
00:45:03,980 --> 00:45:07,480
which does project restores the program

754
00:45:07,480 --> 00:45:11,210
now the second chapter you can actually
read the model number of its a an SPI

755
00:45:11,210 --> 00:45:12,280
flash chip

756
00:45:12,280 --> 00:45:15,810
so if you had syringes that where
careful enough

757
00:45:15,810 --> 00:45:19,400
and they do exist that you can touch the
money where's and you can actually just

758
00:45:19,400 --> 00:45:23,180
step the code the program after the bus
as it copied

759
00:45:23,180 --> 00:45:26,509
from the flash memory chip to the CPU
during booting

760
00:45:26,510 --> 00:45:29,780
but then you need a chemistry lab you
need my criminals

761
00:45:29,780 --> 00:45:33,430
and you don't need that much experience
at the tribunals like as you would to

762
00:45:33,430 --> 00:45:35,890
touch inside a Japanese still in bed

763
00:45:35,890 --> 00:45:39,740
and so is not that valuable than
expected and is then shipped I skipped

764
00:45:39,740 --> 00:45:40,510
over is just

765
00:45:40,510 --> 00:45:45,360
and like stuff for the radio and this
pin here and wonder how I didn't read

766
00:45:45,360 --> 00:45:47,560
this pen is lovely

767
00:45:47,560 --> 00:45:50,710
because you know that all almost all

768
00:45:50,710 --> 00:45:54,110
the connections honors a.m.

769
00:45:54,110 --> 00:45:57,530
this PCB diagram run out and away from
the chip

770
00:45:57,530 --> 00:46:01,120
and there on that perimeter but there
are also some hands on the bottom in

771
00:46:01,120 --> 00:46:01,390
there

772
00:46:01,390 --> 00:46:05,490
almost none of those are used but the
jump back to the

773
00:46:05,490 --> 00:46:08,590
if your friends you can actually see
this bonding wires actually connect the

774
00:46:08,590 --> 00:46:10,670
PCB

775
00:46:10,670 --> 00:46:15,860
those interior pads I test points

776
00:46:15,860 --> 00:46:20,420
things the almost never need to touch
but in every now and then you might

777
00:46:20,420 --> 00:46:23,660
perhaps this thing is dying too much
power and we want to replace the power

778
00:46:23,660 --> 00:46:24,379
supply

779
00:46:24,380 --> 00:46:29,940
last summer well this is the pen that
would put that power

780
00:46:29,940 --> 00:46:33,870
what happens if I put a short circuit
actor

781
00:46:33,870 --> 00:46:39,390
the flash memory has no power but the
Cebu still that's

782
00:46:39,390 --> 00:46:43,580
so the expert is that you strike that
hit the ground and the book the chipper

783
00:46:43,580 --> 00:46:47,270
and the chip is going to crash because
when it tries to read that first word

784
00:46:47,270 --> 00:46:51,300
it does not see okay okay and it is not
see

785
00:46:51,300 --> 00:46:54,440
the SEC owners and CNN mister

786
00:46:54,440 --> 00:46:58,730
I'm now been shipped is unlocked

787
00:46:58,730 --> 00:47:02,150
as the crashes because it realizes that
it can't be for flash memory

788
00:47:02,150 --> 00:47:07,550
and things that you need to reprogram it
working out why it crashed

789
00:47:07,550 --> 00:47:11,870
so then you remove the short circuits
that flash memory starts working again

790
00:47:11,870 --> 00:47:15,410
and aggressive doesn't do anything to
inform us if you have this

791
00:47:15,410 --> 00:47:18,240
so then you can just hook up a regular
jet a good burger and read a copy the

792
00:47:18,240 --> 00:47:19,750
programming our

793
00:47:19,750 --> 00:47:26,750
ran everything us anything

794
00:47:28,700 --> 00:47:30,150
Center

795
00:47:30,150 --> 00:47:33,180
I am running short on time and

796
00:47:33,180 --> 00:47:36,700
need to use kept the zircon expired but
I I can tell it

797
00:47:36,700 --> 00:47:42,309
in ninety per dad's I'm there's this
company cops are gone

798
00:47:42,309 --> 00:47:45,930
and no one really like them because they
wanted a lot of money for their

799
00:47:45,930 --> 00:47:47,788
country's standard which they

800
00:47:47,789 --> 00:47:51,960
got written into the ZigBee smart energy
profile Center

801
00:47:51,960 --> 00:47:55,539
so but ever had to do in many ways cuz
they have the patent

802
00:47:55,539 --> 00:47:58,809
and he is the patents to enforce lesson
saying

803
00:47:58,809 --> 00:48:02,880
I'll keys and a guitar lessons include
issuing a key is

804
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:06,039
so you have to pay as much to

805
00:48:06,039 --> 00:48:10,720
use your own ZigBee library and your own
trip to libraries you want to use theirs

806
00:48:10,720 --> 00:48:14,380
and the end result that was dead

807
00:48:14,380 --> 00:48:17,650
when they shipped their library which
everyone used

808
00:48:17,650 --> 00:48:20,980
they had a buck and the bomb was that

809
00:48:20,980 --> 00:48:25,349
they didn't explain it to the is is that
you needed a really random number

810
00:48:25,349 --> 00:48:26,539
generator

811
00:48:26,539 --> 00:48:29,999
instead they just had a function and you
had to pass

812
00:48:29,999 --> 00:48:34,739
this a pointer to a function that would
return a random 16 that number

813
00:48:34,739 --> 00:48:40,140
so every programmer in every company
that use this library said I'll

814
00:48:40,140 --> 00:48:43,980
I've got that honesty is the seaman
function ok

815
00:48:43,980 --> 00:48:46,989
has the exact same calling convention

816
00:48:46,989 --> 00:48:50,720
and at London and particular down

817
00:48:50,720 --> 00:48:55,380
Texas Instruments they did this as other
thing they take radio noise in the

818
00:48:55,380 --> 00:48:58,259
shuffle it all together and they had to
come up with a bunch by its knees those

819
00:48:58,259 --> 00:48:59,339
bites 2 seed

820
00:48:59,339 --> 00:49:05,259
a 16-bit linear feedback shift register
out so they're all made to the 16

821
00:49:05,259 --> 00:49:09,950
been session keys you can fit the
complete table in a floppy disk

822
00:49:09,950 --> 00:49:13,369
your and government is not so bad but

823
00:49:13,369 --> 00:49:17,779
they were all exploitable in different
ways and so I would like

824
00:49:17,779 --> 00:49:21,809
event at a time but I would like to
invite you to read the fucking papers

825
00:49:21,809 --> 00:49:25,190
and I mean that the

826
00:49:25,190 --> 00:49:28,910
there's only so much that you can get in
a lecture and

827
00:49:28,910 --> 00:49:32,078
when you're reading slides well you see
the

828
00:49:32,079 --> 00:49:35,499
pictures but you don't have the the
voiceover for them and when you watch

829
00:49:35,499 --> 00:49:36,359
the video

830
00:49:36,359 --> 00:49:41,210
it's an hour-long so I am I'm florio
please gonna try was going to be dot com

831
00:49:41,210 --> 00:49:45,960
and read my papers I did not write my
house and I've got a good but that's

832
00:49:45,960 --> 00:49:46,930
just watch that net

833
00:49:46,930 --> 00:49:50,180
you can find a lot of the high rather
use these techniques and a giveaway

834
00:49:50,180 --> 00:49:51,348
PCB's

835
00:49:51,349 --> 00:49:54,599
I either had cost her for free and

836
00:49:54,599 --> 00:49:58,180
if you want them for free just send me
an address don't send me a question as

837
00:49:58,180 --> 00:49:59,480
to whether or not they can be free

838
00:49:59,480 --> 00:50:03,470
because that cost me more time and
that's not neighborly at this point i

839
00:50:03,470 --> 00:50:05,230
think i have five minutes for questions

840
00:50:05,230 --> 00:50:07,940
as we could raise the remaining bits
that I can see people that would be

841
00:50:07,940 --> 00:50:10,160
great actor

842
00:50:10,160 --> 00:50:13,569
the night yes run on a Mac

843
00:50:13,569 --> 00:50:17,420
you push it by the way is a geiger

844
00:50:17,420 --> 00:50:24,420
sure the fire much we love them

845
00:50:27,840 --> 00:50:31,410
after an hour staring at my screen and
saying nothing behind it

846
00:50:31,410 --> 00:50:38,319
unknown nearsighted crazy but no
questions

847
00:50:38,320 --> 00:50:45,320
greater thank you can occur

848
00:50:50,830 --> 00:50:55,230
do
