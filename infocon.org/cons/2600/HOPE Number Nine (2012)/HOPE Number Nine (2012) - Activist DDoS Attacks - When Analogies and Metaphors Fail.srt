good evening everybody

30
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:36,630
my name is Molly solder I'm a graduate
student in comparative Media Studies at

31
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:40,220
MIT and I also do research for the
Center for civic media at the MIT Media

32
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:40,869
Lab

33
00:01:40,869 --> 00:01:45,100
I have to apologize in advance if my
voice gives out before the end of this

34
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:49,070
talk I'm still getting over some sort of
horrible flu I picked up in an airport

35
00:01:49,070 --> 00:01:50,130
in the Netherlands

36
00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:54,280
so I'm I'm sorry if I sound like a frog
at the end a 45-minute

37
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:57,439
as so this talk is about

38
00:01:57,439 --> 00:02:02,299
how previous characterizations activist
deed of attacks have more or less

39
00:02:02,299 --> 00:02:05,460
failed to give us the analytical
groundwork

40
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:09,319
that we need in order to determine
whether or not de dos attacks are

41
00:02:09,319 --> 00:02:12,540
something we want to incorporate into
our activist

42
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:19,400
Rep repertoire as is also the late-night
addition and because you guys have been

43
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:22,980
so kind to show up at eleven o'clock at
night listen to me talk rather than go

44
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:24,390
out and drink and party

45
00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:28,510
they're going to be lotsa cat pictures
in this presentation

46
00:02:28,510 --> 00:02:31,660
I aim to please

47
00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:35,109
so in the course in this talk I'll be
looking at the previous

48
00:02:35,110 --> 00:02:38,849
characterizations that have been most
widespread about activist the DoS

49
00:02:38,849 --> 00:02:39,518
attacks

50
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:43,819
and looking at how different dedust
campaigns are the course of history do

51
00:02:43,819 --> 00:02:46,110
and do not fit into those models

52
00:02:46,110 --> 00:02:50,190
and that next I'll be looking at the
current state a fact misty tostitos over

53
00:02:50,190 --> 00:02:51,920
the past 23 years

54
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:55,440
and then I'll be looking using pretty
I'll be presenting a new analytical

55
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:58,379
model and then using that model to look
at

56
00:02:58,379 --> 00:03:02,959
the operation pay-back attacks from
December 2010

57
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:06,200
so first

58
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:09,319
previous characterizations censorship

59
00:03:09,319 --> 00:03:13,950
censorship is something that a lot of
people talk about when they talk about

60
00:03:13,950 --> 00:03:17,099
activity doesn't act this is something
that you hear a lot from

61
00:03:17,099 --> 00:03:21,110
people who were so say would call to the
dead power have 2 B's know they say that

62
00:03:21,110 --> 00:03:22,470
basically it's the equivalent

63
00:03:22,470 --> 00:03:26,019
shouting people down when you don't
agree with them

64
00:03:26,019 --> 00:03:29,180
sometimes characterization is extremely
apt

65
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:32,319
sometimes the goal over the docs attack
is simply to remove

66
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:37,890
content from the web but if this is an
actually always the most accurate

67
00:03:37,890 --> 00:03:41,739
pointed you to look at the docs attack
I'm gonna be looking at 12 doesn't act

68
00:03:41,739 --> 00:03:46,739
where this was actually the most
accurate way of characterizing it so in

69
00:03:46,739 --> 00:03:47,010
this

70
00:03:47,010 --> 00:03:51,519
in July of 1997 a large-scale the DoS
attack was launched against the

71
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:55,090
Institute for Global Communications
otherwise known as the IGCC which was a

72
00:03:55,090 --> 00:04:00,340
nonprofit Internet Service Provider
number and the organizers of this attack

73
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:03,930
are really well known it was a
large-scale attack me mostly originated

74
00:04:03,930 --> 00:04:04,750
in Spain

75
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:09,200
go love this attack was to pressure the
IGCC to stop posting

76
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:14,709
something called the ESC well had a a
sure now if anyone hears speaks basque

77
00:04:14,709 --> 00:04:16,798
I'm really sorry for butchering that

78
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:21,349
on it was thought that this journal
which was a basque cultural political

79
00:04:21,350 --> 00:04:22,919
journal had ties

80
00:04:22,919 --> 00:04:27,099
280 which was a basque paramilitary
organization

81
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:30,259
the attack insisted up the combination
up

82
00:04:30,259 --> 00:04:35,460
mail bombing and network-based deed of
attacks this was a very populous minded

83
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:40,099
action and it initially was supported by
major mainstream news organizations

84
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:43,259
like el pie which is the major national
Spanish newspaper

85
00:04:43,259 --> 00:04:46,850
who originally published the targeted
email addresses for the mail bombing

86
00:04:46,850 --> 00:04:47,500
attack

87
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:50,979
the later they figured out that that
wasn't probably the best idea so they

88
00:04:50,979 --> 00:04:55,080
retracted their support for the reaction

89
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:58,479
the idea server I just the servers were
knocked offline

90
00:04:58,479 --> 00:05:02,560
and their email server was completely
hosed and disrupted service to over

91
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:04,810
13,000 subscribers

92
00:05:04,810 --> 00:05:07,830
they did eventually remove hosting

93
00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:12,370
for the journal though it was under
heavy protests in fact they were placed

94
00:05:12,370 --> 00:05:16,300
the content that they were removing with
a big letter that basically said

95
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:20,870
we have been bullied into removing this
content and that's totally not OK

96
00:05:20,870 --> 00:05:24,229
no supported in their arguments by
groups like net action the computer

97
00:05:24,229 --> 00:05:26,258
professionals for social responsibility

98
00:05:26,259 --> 00:05:29,810
and the Association for progressive
communications

99
00:05:29,810 --> 00:05:35,009
go love this attack was to force I do
see to remove this content

100
00:05:35,009 --> 00:05:38,870
it was an objection to a national policy
it was an objection to even

101
00:05:38,870 --> 00:05:44,360
a policy that I do see had it the goal
was to make this content unavailable

102
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:47,410
for as long as this attack was
successfully running

103
00:05:47,410 --> 00:05:50,910
it was achieving its goal it didn't need
to convince

104
00:05:50,910 --> 00:05:54,350
anybody have anything it didn't need you
have an argument with anyone it didn't

105
00:05:54,350 --> 00:05:55,310
you have a debate

106
00:05:55,310 --> 00:05:59,080
it needed to keep going to keep this
content down

107
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:02,780
this wasn't an invitation to political
activism this was a

108
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:06,940
if you don't take this stuff down will
take it down for you

109
00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:10,900
so in essence the goal of the de dos was
a permanent position up its immediate

110
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:11,740
affects

111
00:06:11,740 --> 00:06:14,520
well-being of actions are often
condemned for being as good as

112
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:15,310
censorship

113
00:06:15,310 --> 00:06:18,580
the actual go love this particular tap
it was censorship

114
00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:22,090
and in the end at the condemnation it
suffered was as much for its goal is for

115
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:23,289
it tactics

116
00:06:23,289 --> 00:06:27,229
however I'm sorry

117
00:06:27,229 --> 00:06:31,039
this there's no records of who actually
organized this attack I'm sorry I wish

118
00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:34,680
there was my paper would be better for
it

119
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:39,100
but where the censorship condemnation
fell fall short is in its assigning

120
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:43,330
equal value to any potential target and
any potential

121
00:06:43,330 --> 00:06:47,849
motivation online the ID see target
attack targeted politically vulnerable

122
00:06:47,850 --> 00:06:49,720
speech online and I

123
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:53,900
an obliterated this particular journals
ability to reach its audience and a

124
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:57,840
cripple BIG sees ability to perform its
professional function which was serving

125
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:59,669
content to people online

126
00:06:59,669 --> 00:07:03,150
however targeting the website are for
instance a large multinational

127
00:07:03,150 --> 00:07:05,210
corporation or government agency

128
00:07:05,210 --> 00:07:08,789
often had little effect on the actual
operations

129
00:07:08,789 --> 00:07:12,199
other entity and its ability to
communicate both internally and to the

130
00:07:12,199 --> 00:07:15,139
public through media appearances our
press releases

131
00:07:15,139 --> 00:07:18,330
it would be absurd to declare ethical
equivalency

132
00:07:18,330 --> 00:07:22,979
between seeking to silence continent i
rly as was the goal in this attack

133
00:07:22,979 --> 00:07:28,199
and the relatively Inc inconvenienced
suffered by large corporations who's

134
00:07:28,199 --> 00:07:31,419
online posters has been have been
briefly torn down

135
00:07:31,419 --> 00:07:34,818
to paraphrase xkcd

136
00:07:34,819 --> 00:07:38,099
a second major characterization that is
often applied to

137
00:07:38,099 --> 00:07:41,330
deed of the taxes the electronics it in

138
00:07:41,330 --> 00:07:44,568
I really love this picture

139
00:07:44,569 --> 00:07:48,539
the electronics it in was clearly
articulated by

140
00:07:48,539 --> 00:07:51,580
some a group called the critical Art
Ensemble which is a performance art and

141
00:07:51,580 --> 00:07:52,878
activism collective

142
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:56,169
in the essay elektronik civil
disobedience there they drew an

143
00:07:56,169 --> 00:07:58,190
equivalency between the monopolization

144
00:07:58,190 --> 00:08:01,930
resources that takes place in a I R L
sedan

145
00:08:01,930 --> 00:08:05,780
and monopolization resources that occurs
on the technological level

146
00:08:05,780 --> 00:08:09,500
during a deed of campaign this
characterization draws heavily on the

147
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:10,879
history of sit-ins

148
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:14,750
in social movements for a lot of its
validity

149
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:19,319
in 2001 the electron disturbance theater
which was a spinoff of the critical Art

150
00:08:19,319 --> 00:08:23,669
Ensemble launched a campaign that they
called the deportation class action

151
00:08:23,669 --> 00:08:26,940
estimates put the number participants in
this particular action at a roughly

152
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:29,050
13,000 ever take

153
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:32,680
these press runs were primarily
recruited through website

154
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:37,110
and mailing lists mostly performance art
and activism related

155
00:08:37,110 --> 00:08:40,580
go love this action was to pressure
Lufthansa Airlines

156
00:08:40,580 --> 00:08:45,690
to stop flying deported immigrants out
of the country on its flights

157
00:08:45,690 --> 00:08:50,000
and through and interesting it was to
draw awareness to this issue and also to

158
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,180
pressure the airline to stop doing it

159
00:08:52,180 --> 00:08:55,920
the online action was powered by
something called flood net which was a

160
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:57,110
di da stool

161
00:08:57,110 --> 00:09:01,380
that the electronic that after a
disturbance here developed in 1998

162
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:05,700
to allow participants to participate in
pre-planned deed of campaigns there was

163
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:07,170
a predetermined list

164
00:09:07,170 --> 00:09:10,550
up targets that you could select from
you couldn't just target anything that

165
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:11,390
you wanted

166
00:09:11,390 --> 00:09:15,120
it also required users take positive
steps in order to participate in those

167
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:15,959
campaigns

168
00:09:15,959 --> 00:09:19,860
it was web-based so you had to be online
sitting in front of your computer

169
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:24,300
and you had to click a button to
positively participate in the campaign

170
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:28,160
the flood that action was augmented by
press releases and protests that left

171
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:28,800
hand just

172
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:33,440
stockholder meetings this action did
result in downtime for the fans a

173
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:34,320
website

174
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:37,470
and they did eventually stop flying be

175
00:09:37,470 --> 00:09:41,890
deported immigrants out of the country
so day

176
00:09:41,890 --> 00:09:45,850
the other thing that happened was that
this action result in an arrest and

177
00:09:45,850 --> 00:09:46,360
trial

178
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:51,450
Andreas Thomas bogle who was an activist
who hosted a website called Libertad

179
00:09:51,450 --> 00:09:52,490
that de-

180
00:09:52,490 --> 00:09:55,920
which posted a call to action for the
left-hander protest

181
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:59,319
initially a lower court found mobile
guilty of using force against

182
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:00,310
left-hander

183
00:10:00,310 --> 00:10:04,690
based on economic losses the airline had
suffered during the campaign

184
00:10:04,690 --> 00:10:07,720
apart appeal however a higher court
overturned the verdict

185
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:11,350
find it finding that the online
demonstration did not consist of a show

186
00:10:11,350 --> 00:10:12,240
of force

187
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:15,890
but was rather intended to influence
public opinion

188
00:10:15,890 --> 00:10:20,300
now the stated goal glut on the action
was to drop public attention to a

189
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:21,040
specific

190
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:25,459
act aspect up the airline's business and
through that attention

191
00:10:25,459 --> 00:10:29,540
change behavior though the deed of
attack took place on the internet the

192
00:10:29,540 --> 00:10:34,099
effect it sa to have was not limited to
and was not even present online

193
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:37,170
is important to know that in and of
itself the deed of attack could not have

194
00:10:37,170 --> 00:10:37,880
achieved

195
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:41,709
what etan Bowl will set out to
accomplish they set out to change the

196
00:10:41,709 --> 00:10:43,329
behavior of a corporation

197
00:10:43,329 --> 00:10:47,089
but it took positive action on the part
about 100 to make that happen

198
00:10:47,089 --> 00:10:51,029
it could not be accomplished by fiat by
activists on the outside

199
00:10:51,029 --> 00:10:54,660
one of the benefits are the electron
exiting characterization

200
00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:58,010
is that it references attacked it with a
very visible history

201
00:10:58,010 --> 00:11:01,819
most people already know what a sedan
looks like the comparison holds up

202
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:02,630
provided that

203
00:11:02,630 --> 00:11:06,880
technology used is heavily reliant on
individual agency

204
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:10,430
with participants either using manual
dedust was like club med

205
00:11:10,430 --> 00:11:14,130
or participating in strictly voluntary
botnets

206
00:11:14,130 --> 00:11:18,399
the you so sophisticated traffic
multipliers exploits or not voluntary

207
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:19,180
botnet

208
00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:22,769
complicates the situation enormously and
can make the use of this

209
00:11:22,769 --> 00:11:25,500
characterization seem overly simplistic

210
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:30,440
and self-congratulatory now are in a
move on to a description of the current

211
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:34,029
state of the tactic looking at how it
sometimes different from the different

212
00:11:34,029 --> 00:11:35,709
they tacked that I just described

213
00:11:35,709 --> 00:11:39,490
and how has new challenges to face

214
00:11:39,490 --> 00:11:43,110
the first we're gonna look at the
desired impact love the most recent de

215
00:11:43,110 --> 00:11:43,970
dos attacks

216
00:11:43,970 --> 00:11:47,240
I also really like this picture

217
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:51,870
the primary goal love many popular deed
of campaigns and by popular dedust

218
00:11:51,870 --> 00:11:53,170
campaigns I mean

219
00:11:53,170 --> 00:11:56,829
campaigns which seek the participation
of a large group of people

220
00:11:56,829 --> 00:12:01,709
be sorta Wildcat news dedust strikes by
individuals is beyond the scope of this

221
00:12:01,709 --> 00:12:05,290
talk but I'm happy to talk about in the
question session

222
00:12:05,290 --> 00:12:08,980
to the primary goal of many Tea Party
yes campaign's is to use

223
00:12:08,980 --> 00:12:13,610
is to direct media coverage and you
impact the identity of those

224
00:12:13,610 --> 00:12:15,620
participating in the action

225
00:12:15,620 --> 00:12:19,310
like the look on the campaign these
actions ultimately seek societal on

226
00:12:19,310 --> 00:12:21,850
policy changes that cannot be achieved

227
00:12:21,850 --> 00:12:25,209
simply by taking down a website by the
goal is to attract

228
00:12:25,209 --> 00:12:29,149
significant attention to a senate issues
and to cultivate a population that

229
00:12:29,149 --> 00:12:30,100
consider themselves

230
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:36,490
activists and you can be called on to
participate in further actions

231
00:12:36,490 --> 00:12:40,279
second technological challenges I want
one of those kittens

232
00:12:40,279 --> 00:12:44,889
I don't want the computer but I want one
of those kittens it is way harder now

233
00:12:44,889 --> 00:12:48,339
than it was in 1997 or even in 2001

234
00:12:48,339 --> 00:12:51,399
to take down a major corporate site to
the power out

235
00:12:51,399 --> 00:12:55,040
a bunch of people sitting behind their
computers pressing a button

236
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:59,490
traffic multipliers and non volunteer
botnet can give all volunteer efforts

237
00:12:59,490 --> 00:13:01,870
that because they need to bring down a
huge site

238
00:13:01,870 --> 00:13:05,760
but these tactics have the potential to
deliver genovise activist de dos in the

239
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:06,930
eyes of the media

240
00:13:06,930 --> 00:13:13,160
policy policy makers as well as the
people who participate in the actions

241
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:16,430
there'd be organizer to spend pool has
shifted

242
00:13:16,430 --> 00:13:20,070
the electrolyte disturbance theater
spread word about actions be activism

243
00:13:20,070 --> 00:13:22,990
and Performing Arts Center mailing lists
and message boards

244
00:13:22,990 --> 00:13:26,420
as a result their part their
participants were more often than not

245
00:13:26,420 --> 00:13:30,730
experience activists well-versed in the
practices and risks on the street

246
00:13:30,730 --> 00:13:31,810
activism

247
00:13:31,810 --> 00:13:35,240
well they may have had an incomplete
understanding of the online space they

248
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:36,430
were moving into

249
00:13:36,430 --> 00:13:39,589
it is safe to assume they had an
understanding the legal risks often

250
00:13:39,589 --> 00:13:42,320
associated with AXA civil disobedience

251
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:46,589
this has not necessarily been the case
with more recent dedust campaigns

252
00:13:46,589 --> 00:13:49,810
activism minded individuals have come
onto the scene with a little

253
00:13:49,810 --> 00:13:52,829
actual activism experience either I R L

254
00:13:52,829 --> 00:13:57,160
or in the digital realm their tactics
are often innovative and interesting

255
00:13:57,160 --> 00:14:00,920
but they lack a core awareness at the
basic risks they are exposing themselves

256
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:02,050
to

257
00:14:02,050 --> 00:14:05,209
the media attention attracted by these
actions

258
00:14:05,209 --> 00:14:09,810
has attracted more neophytes to the
cause but this puts more pressure on me

259
00:14:09,810 --> 00:14:13,500
people in leadership positions to
educate the newcomers as to tactics

260
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:14,769
norms ethics

261
00:14:14,769 --> 00:14:18,540
and be actual legal implications of what
they're doing

262
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:22,019
the relative ease with with which
individuals can become involved in a

263
00:14:22,019 --> 00:14:23,199
piecemeal fashion

264
00:14:23,199 --> 00:14:27,380
with different campaigns also leads to
high turnover in the active population

265
00:14:27,380 --> 00:14:31,810
which makes it difficult for a political
culture which is trying to establish its

266
00:14:31,810 --> 00:14:33,889
own internal norms and mods

267
00:14:33,889 --> 00:14:39,800
as well as a soldier to mislead
outsiders continue in a consistent node

268
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:44,079
legal status just in case anyone in this
room has

269
00:14:44,079 --> 00:14:48,810
any doubt about it whatsoever de dos
attacks are you legal

270
00:14:48,810 --> 00:14:52,820
in this country and in many other
jurisdictions in this country it's a

271
00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:53,670
felony

272
00:14:53,670 --> 00:14:57,670
please don't take anything I'm saying to
can go out and do something illegal and

273
00:14:57,670 --> 00:15:00,370
then yell at me about it

274
00:15:00,370 --> 00:15:04,639
participating in a detox attack even if
you're doing it for political reasons

275
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:09,680
remains a very high-risk activity unlike
many other activities associated with

276
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:13,910
I R L activism including street marches
and sit-ins

277
00:15:13,910 --> 00:15:17,980
the onus to educate inexperienced
participants about these risks falls to

278
00:15:17,980 --> 00:15:21,920
the organizers as does the ethical issue
of whether or not these types of actions

279
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:23,190
are at this time

280
00:15:23,190 --> 00:15:28,990
work worth the legal risk that you are
incurring by participating in them

281
00:15:28,990 --> 00:15:33,600
finally their massive debates about what
the definition of a successful attack

282
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:40,600
is

283
00:15:41,579 --> 00:15:46,639
okay okay many activists are moving away
from a strict buying that binary

284
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:49,690
website up website down cut conception
up

285
00:15:49,690 --> 00:15:53,519
what success is to more nuanced views
like number participants

286
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:57,570
number participants to stick around for
other campaigns and levels of media

287
00:15:57,570 --> 00:15:58,149
coverage

288
00:15:58,149 --> 00:16:01,699
about the attack and the issues that the
attack was meant to draw attention to

289
00:16:01,699 --> 00:16:03,560
you

290
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:07,199
next are moving to the new analytical
model that I'm proposing

291
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:10,740
that we use to look at these de dos
attacks determine whether or not their

292
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:13,329
ballot

293
00:16:13,329 --> 00:16:16,509
in order to take into account but the
new developments and activity of

294
00:16:16,509 --> 00:16:20,430
campaigns and to allow for an accurate
analysis to the use the tactic

295
00:16:20,430 --> 00:16:24,949
IRAs this analytical model rather than
reacting based on an objection to deduct

296
00:16:24,949 --> 00:16:25,759
the whole

297
00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:30,019
or comparison to what is already
existing this model looks at

298
00:16:30,019 --> 00:16:33,639
motivations behind a campaign its
intended affects

299
00:16:33,639 --> 00:16:37,720
it actual a fax and the technologies
used before coming to a conclusion about

300
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:40,430
the legitimacy of an activist action

301
00:16:40,430 --> 00:16:44,930
using this model we can look at
anonymous is December 2010 operation

302
00:16:44,930 --> 00:16:46,630
pay-back dedust campaign

303
00:16:46,630 --> 00:16:49,769
against Pay Pal another side the same
way that we looked at the campaign's

304
00:16:49,769 --> 00:16:50,920
earlier

305
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:56,220
everyone can laugh at the cat now

306
00:16:56,220 --> 00:16:59,990
well operation pay-back began as an
opposition to the MPAA and other

307
00:16:59,990 --> 00:17:01,720
copyright associations

308
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:05,579
December 16 2010 marked the beginning at
the second stage in the

309
00:17:05,579 --> 00:17:08,770
at the campaign sometimes known as
Operation oven dish avenge

310
00:17:08,770 --> 00:17:12,910
a sponge just hard to say these attacks
were powered by

311
00:17:12,910 --> 00:17:16,990
Deloitte de dos tool and volunteer
botnet run to the like

312
00:17:16,990 --> 00:17:22,370
fucking hivemind node and as well as non
volunteer botnets

313
00:17:22,370 --> 00:17:26,049
this stage in the campaign targeted
organizations and individuals that

314
00:17:26,049 --> 00:17:26,760
Anonymous

315
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:30,570
lead were acting against the interests
of WikiLeaks either by cutting off it's

316
00:17:30,570 --> 00:17:32,370
channels a financial support

317
00:17:32,370 --> 00:17:36,030
refusing to plot supply hosting to the
website in its domain name

318
00:17:36,030 --> 00:17:39,740
or by speaking out against the
organization publicly the overall goal

319
00:17:39,740 --> 00:17:43,360
was to draw attention to the ongoing
banking blockade against WikiLeaks and a

320
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:45,440
force media coverage of the issue

321
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:48,789
over the course of about four days
anonymous would launch date of attacks

322
00:17:48,789 --> 00:17:50,179
against the website up

323
00:17:50,179 --> 00:17:53,210
the Swedish prosecution authority every

324

joseph Lieberman website MasterCard to
israeli politicians bees up a power line

325
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:58,690
amazon dot com

326
00:17:58,690 --> 00:18:02,539
many of these web sites registered some
amount of down time over the course to

327
00:18:02,539 --> 00:18:04,629
be the tax

328
00:18:04,630 --> 00:18:08,270
the campaign led to a truly massive
amount of media coverage

329
00:18:08,270 --> 00:18:12,129
mostly anonymous itself but also the
banking blockade in various other

330
00:18:12,130 --> 00:18:15,970
grievances publicize an anonymous press
releases a call to action

331
00:18:15,970 --> 00:18:19,320
it brought extraordinary public
attention to anonymous and with that

332
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:23,610
came many new participants who joined in
the DoS attack as it was going

333
00:18:23,610 --> 00:18:27,890
it also led to the arrest over a dozen
participants in the United States

334
00:18:27,890 --> 00:18:30,919
who were later charged with felony
violations at the Computer Fraud and

335
00:18:30,919 --> 00:18:31,660
Abuse Act

336
00:18:31,660 --> 00:18:35,280
and more individuals being arrested
individually others had their homes

337
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:40,178
raided by the FBI and their various
electronic possessions got confiscated

338
00:18:40,179 --> 00:18:44,740
the December deed of attacks in
operation pay back back back very far

339
00:18:44,740 --> 00:18:47,830
closer resemblance to the electron
disturbance theaters

340
00:18:47,830 --> 00:18:53,010
2001 left-hander action than they do the
IGCC attacks in 1997

341
00:18:53,010 --> 00:18:56,240
though be diffuse unorganized and
leadership in on

342
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:59,740
very much closer resemblance to the
placement population in the I do see

343
00:18:59,740 --> 00:19:00,789
attacks

344
00:19:00,789 --> 00:19:04,000
made up as it was if individuals
recruited through enthusiastic media

345
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:04,799
coverage

346
00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:08,260
disparate people coming together in a
moment our in one moment around one

347
00:19:08,260 --> 00:19:09,360
emotional issue

348
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:14,100
the motivation an actual affects
operation pay-back are far more akin to

349
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:18,200
the electron disturbance leaders push
for popular attention in policy change

350
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:21,260
a primary goal of operation event
Avenger signed

351
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:24,350
was to bring widespread attention to the
plight of WikiLeaks

352
00:19:24,350 --> 00:19:28,350
and in it in that it succeeded a
secondary goal was to cause financial

353
00:19:28,350 --> 00:19:31,200
damage an embarrassment to the
corporation's targeted

354
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:35,340
but as I stated earlier bring down a
corporate website does not restrict

355
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:39,530
that corporation's ability to function
or communicate with the outside world

356
00:19:39,530 --> 00:19:43,580
rather corporations targeted by
anonymous had caused more harm to wiki

357
00:19:43,580 --> 00:19:45,320
leaks is ability to function

358
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:48,860
by you larry cutting off its means of
support refusing to host it

359
00:19:48,860 --> 00:19:52,890
those actions in at themselves
constitute a denial of service attack

360
00:19:52,890 --> 00:19:55,890
in the most basic sense of the term the
use

361
00:19:55,890 --> 00:19:59,870
have not volunteer But Nets to achieve
downtime

362
00:19:59,870 --> 00:20:02,890
in the targeted servers is very
troubling

363
00:20:02,890 --> 00:20:07,390
as is the lack of success in educating
participants in the legal risks that

364
00:20:07,390 --> 00:20:08,580
they were facing

365
00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:12,590
I feel that neither of these facts are
troubling enough to completely delete

366
00:20:12,590 --> 00:20:16,459
your demise operation pay back as a
reasonable active civil protest

367
00:20:16,460 --> 00:20:21,270
but they are mistakes that need to be
learned from in future actions

368
00:20:21,270 --> 00:20:24,470
inclusions in conclusion

369
00:20:24,470 --> 00:20:28,030
their uses the deed of attacks that are
more appropriate and acceptable

370
00:20:28,030 --> 00:20:32,260
enacted this context and others not
every deed of attack that claimed the

371
00:20:32,260 --> 00:20:34,700
actor this label does so appropriately

372
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:38,580
it is also possible to say that though
the technological results have won t

373
00:20:38,580 --> 00:20:40,980
does attack may be indistinguishable
from another

374
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:46,380
the actual a fax differ widely based on
the circumstances in context a given

375
00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:47,320
action

376
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:50,490
an act an attack on the homepage a large
corporation

377
00:20:50,490 --> 00:20:54,120
may draw a large amount of media
attention but have little immediate

378
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:56,460
effect on the corporation itself

379
00:20:56,460 --> 00:21:00,340
well attack on a smaller internet based
organization may completely wipe it out

380
00:21:00,340 --> 00:21:03,580
while attracting no attention to
criticism it all

381
00:21:03,580 --> 00:21:07,990
what may be considered censorship in one
instance can reasonably be considered

382
00:21:07,990 --> 00:21:12,159
not censorship in another though the
technological facts at hand remain the

383
00:21:12,159 --> 00:21:12,730
same

384
00:21:12,730 --> 00:21:16,620
well attempting to determine the
validity of an activist deed of action

385
00:21:16,620 --> 00:21:21,100
or any contentious computer action it is
vital that we not privilege the

386
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:22,520
technological fax

387
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:26,730
over the motivations and stated goals at
the participants and the actual fact

388
00:21:26,730 --> 00:21:27,830
that the action

389
00:21:27,830 --> 00:21:31,960
to do so would ignore the fact that
identical technological states can be

390
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:34,780
arrived at under vastly differing
circumstances

391
00:21:34,780 --> 00:21:41,299
and ultimately devalues human agency in
our dealings with technology

392
00:21:41,299 --> 00:21:46,490
questioning cat wants to know if you
have questions

393
00:21:46,490 --> 00:21:49,870
I was told to make sure you can add that
microphone otherwise no one will hear

394
00:21:49,870 --> 00:21:50,250
you

395
00:21:50,250 --> 00:21:53,730
I think it's on okay okay I'm actually a
a train activists

396
00:21:53,730 --> 00:21:57,700
home and so I wanted to hear more about
sorta how

397
00:21:57,700 --> 00:22:02,820
the the people who are organizing or on
organizing the DoS attacks like

398
00:22:02,820 --> 00:22:06,299
organizing themselves and I more about
this

399
00:22:06,299 --> 00:22:09,590
stayed the train to the untrained

400
00:22:09,590 --> 00:22:13,220
Agnes organizers so that I think the

401
00:22:13,220 --> 00:22:17,179
current landscape is extremely varied
this is whether the awesome things about

402
00:22:17,179 --> 00:22:20,549
looking at different digital tactics and
in

403
00:22:20,549 --> 00:22:25,260
the digital activism realm everyone's
doing something different everyone

404
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:29,230
started waiting to shake out what is
going to be the most effective

405
00:22:29,230 --> 00:22:32,740
there were some there are some people
who operate more in the traditional

406
00:22:32,740 --> 00:22:38,710
edta brown where they have organize
mailing list a potential participants to

407
00:22:38,710 --> 00:22:43,750
they have who've been around for a while
and calls will go out over that

408
00:22:43,750 --> 00:22:47,559
there's also the more anonymous noted
recreate this fence which is

409
00:22:47,559 --> 00:22:50,740
throw up a call to action on Twitter our
pace been

410
00:22:50,740 --> 00:22:54,380
and see who shows up which has the
potential for having

411
00:22:54,380 --> 00:22:58,780
far more people participate and you can
had to go viral and suddenly you have

412
00:22:58,780 --> 00:23:01,850
way marked as was the you know what to
do with but you also around the

413
00:23:01,850 --> 00:23:05,070
issue where sometimes people don't know
what they're doing and sometimes you put

414
00:23:05,070 --> 00:23:06,178
themselves at risk

415
00:23:06,179 --> 00:23:10,260
and how do you keep people safe who you
are essentially saying this is a

416
00:23:10,260 --> 00:23:13,220
legitimate call to action this is
legitimate action

417
00:23:13,220 --> 00:23:16,409
and people are trusting you

418
00:23:16,409 --> 00:23:19,900
and if they're far away and you can't
like rarely get under them

419
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:23,409
sometimes it's hard to protect them

420
00:23:23,409 --> 00:23:30,409
any other questions questioning cat
loves questions

421
00:23:33,790 --> 00:23:37,440
you said that to you may have some
things to say about individual

422
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:40,500
um the DOS in the question session

423
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:46,940
so so individual de dos campaigns tend
to be far more oriented towards stripped

424
00:23:46,940 --> 00:23:47,850
down time

425
00:23:47,850 --> 00:23:54,850
and there's a lot a there's a lot of
scalping mentality I think a lot of

426
00:23:55,030 --> 00:23:56,160
people who just

427
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:59,200
who who want to say a who wants a tango
Down

428
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:02,610
on Twitter on their blog or on pace been

429
00:24:02,610 --> 00:24:07,930
and they there is that one-up me up man
shit mentality that happens with the

430
00:24:07,930 --> 00:24:10,280
Wildcat one person de dos

431
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:16,240
campaigns it also there's less
legitimacy

432
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:22,400
around that because that one is far more
like throwing a brick through a window

433
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:25,540
then it is getting a bunch of your
friends together and sitting at a lunch

434
00:24:25,540 --> 00:24:26,040
counter

435
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:29,330
if we're gonna go back to the metaphor
in some ways but I promised I wouldn't

436
00:24:29,330 --> 00:24:29,699
do

437
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:34,510
so those tend to be far less defensible

438
00:24:34,510 --> 00:24:39,690
as a civic action because they're not or
they're only oriented around 1 percent

439
00:24:39,690 --> 00:24:43,000
forcing their opinion on somebody else
rather than a large group of people

440
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,780
stating their opinion

441
00:24:44,780 --> 00:24:48,040
in a collective voice that is my opinion

442
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:51,889
and I'm sure other people have different
opinions and I would be delighted to

443
00:24:51,890 --> 00:24:52,530
hear them

444
00:24:52,530 --> 00:24:57,910
good things I'm totally fallacious

445
00:24:57,910 --> 00:25:02,310
I want to hear from someone who doesn't
agree with me maybe they all went out

446
00:25:02,310 --> 00:25:02,889
drinking

447
00:25:02,890 --> 00:25:07,980
you a

448
00:25:07,980 --> 00:25:12,330
because they have a like two opinions on
our express from learning

449
00:25:12,330 --> 00:25:17,220
effect this effectiveness in general
like stated goals and various like

450
00:25:17,220 --> 00:25:18,200
communiques

451
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:22,270
is a tax instead one is the on the one
hand

452
00:25:22,270 --> 00:25:25,410
like it only takes one

453
00:25:25,410 --> 00:25:29,140
dedicated person theoretically little
with the didn't have knowledge

454
00:25:29,140 --> 00:25:32,760
said you know do some concerted damage
to some

455
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:36,470
entity or something like you know up
their servers or whatever

456
00:25:36,470 --> 00:25:39,830
whereas like the DDoS thing it's like
more based on getting a lot of people

457
00:25:39,830 --> 00:25:40,600
involved

458
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:44,430
with or without their consent to then

459
00:25:44,430 --> 00:25:48,540
just basically flat a website usually is
why I never actually been seen

460
00:25:48,540 --> 00:25:51,600
heard a video S attacked that

461
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:55,170
wasn't basically just again some like
public website or something

462
00:25:55,170 --> 00:25:58,560
that in average person goes to and

463
00:25:58,560 --> 00:26:03,929
and I feel like it's like if your goal
is to like cause in NZ damage it seems

464
00:26:03,930 --> 00:26:05,090
like the former

465
00:26:05,090 --> 00:26:09,270
seems like is more fact than actually
doing damage was the other is just like

466
00:26:09,270 --> 00:26:12,930
temporarily preventing access or
something then like the other

467
00:26:12,930 --> 00:26:17,450
your thing is like I'm wondering like in
general I these things usually

468
00:26:17,450 --> 00:26:21,020
and it seems like in the modern era like
it got a little lazy in like the primary

469
00:26:21,020 --> 00:26:21,940
way in which

470
00:26:21,940 --> 00:26:25,090
hacktivism happens is just through the
EOS

471
00:26:25,090 --> 00:26:29,250
but your thing is like all these things
it acts like

472
00:26:29,250 --> 00:26:32,920
in terms effective is is kind of like
war how

473
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:36,450
what is is neces- well how is this even
hurting

474
00:26:36,450 --> 00:26:41,030
is to kill them I listen to like is
articles from various like organizations

475
00:26:41,030 --> 00:26:41,660
that are like

476
00:26:41,660 --> 00:26:45,890
seriously like really scared and they're
really scared he's activists and hackers

477
00:26:45,890 --> 00:26:46,190
and

478
00:26:46,190 --> 00:26:50,530
over China did it damage to them just by
taking on their website and burial in

479
00:26:50,530 --> 00:26:52,800
the this is terrible it's a huge threat
in like

480
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:55,810
like but Brett you let's take a simple
yet it's like

481
00:26:55,810 --> 00:26:58,940
yeah I mean her down a poster hung up by
the yeah

482
00:26:58,940 --> 00:27:03,670
game any it I mean there is this one
attack me with my auntie sectors on me

483
00:27:03,670 --> 00:27:04,210
like that

484
00:27:04,210 --> 00:27:09,230
that the isley just temporarily took
down a buncha

485
00:27:09,230 --> 00:27:12,850
police oriented web sites around the
country and these are probably what

486
00:27:12,850 --> 00:27:13,960
states that only like

487
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:18,260
you know 500 people a year ago you go to
a lot

488
00:27:18,260 --> 00:27:22,040
like somewhat safer sheriffs Association
is in the it's like these web sites

489
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:23,090
being up and down like

490
00:27:23,090 --> 00:27:27,590
has literally nothing to do with like
you know calls coming in to report

491
00:27:27,590 --> 00:27:30,940
crimes like whatever they thought the
radically like they're disrupting like

492
00:27:30,940 --> 00:27:35,150
is just some website that just has a
phone number on it or something

493
00:27:35,150 --> 00:27:39,290
well thats back to that the fact that
down time is now

494
00:27:39,290 --> 00:27:42,820
frankly not a serious call downtime

495
00:27:42,820 --> 00:27:46,500
isn't that price it's absurd upper
downtime you're right

496
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:50,920
and like I said this doesn't actually
have a real effect on how a lot of these

497
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:52,220
organizations operate

498
00:27:52,220 --> 00:27:55,590
what does have a real impact on how
these organizations operate is a lot of

499
00:27:55,590 --> 00:27:56,900
the media coverage that

500
00:27:56,900 --> 00:28:00,240
follows the lead of attacks around
frankly journalists have been trained

501
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:01,740
over the last 23 years

502
00:28:01,740 --> 00:28:05,090
to follow the lead of attacks because
they

503
00:28:05,090 --> 00:28:08,280
sound like hacking they look like
packing they don't enough

504
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:12,800
they don't know enough to know that it's
not really hacking and hacking cells

505
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:16,770
newspapers slash magazines flash is
quickly

506
00:28:16,770 --> 00:28:20,370
so these ten types of actions tend to
attract a lot of attention

507
00:28:20,370 --> 00:28:24,660
and that attention that is the goal the
downtime is

508
00:28:24,660 --> 00:28:28,810
its fine you can say me take this
website down for five minutes

509
00:28:28,810 --> 00:28:33,290
but it's not the primary goal you're not
actually aiming to disrupt anything

510
00:28:33,290 --> 00:28:37,230
you're aiming to attract attention I
guess it depends on what your goals are

511
00:28:37,230 --> 00:28:37,810
very mean

512
00:28:37,810 --> 00:28:41,980
in somebody's communiques it seems the
goals were seemingly larger than that

513
00:28:41,980 --> 00:28:42,640
made

514
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:46,580
believe that they like we're trying to
really like disrupt serious things

515
00:28:46,580 --> 00:28:49,860
I just question the effectiveness that I
feel like we need to get more back to

516
00:28:49,860 --> 00:28:50,330
the

517
00:28:50,330 --> 00:28:54,330
I'm in real life effectiveness have a
call to action that said we're gonna get

518
00:28:54,330 --> 00:28:59,020
Gawker to cover this de dos attack: if
you show up

519
00:28:59,020 --> 00:29:03,960
I to it tracks way more people to play
spades you say we're gonna bring down

520
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:07,440
the Maricopa shape sheriff's website

521
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:11,760
show up will bring it down we'll show
those people in Arizona

522
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:14,760
mean that they can't boss us around

523
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:21,179
its yet but I actually like civil action
in this type to protest have always been

524
00:29:21,179 --> 00:29:26,679
up very large part about primary the
newspaper coverage and the news coverage

525
00:29:26,679 --> 00:29:30,910
its does a lot more for your cause when
the New York Times has a huge picture of

526
00:29:30,910 --> 00:29:31,790
your protest

527
00:29:31,790 --> 00:29:35,110
then if nobody pays attention to you at
all

528
00:29:35,110 --> 00:29:39,000
maybe after I'm MMA main thought is that
would I don't mean to

529
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:42,530
and others like a hold very Digital
conference everything but a I kinda

530
00:29:42,530 --> 00:29:46,540
and I feel like we need to get more back
to that there's a hole like inactive

531
00:29:46,540 --> 00:29:48,620
something going on legal and illegal

532
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:52,050
at you like a very diff like difficult
part about like

533
00:29:52,050 --> 00:29:55,530
that you know people seeking to be in
supposing move means today is

534
00:29:55,530 --> 00:30:00,428
that they think being a movement means
like looking like button on Facebook in

535
00:30:00,429 --> 00:30:03,679
like Oh like this person it helps them
like it really doesn't like

536
00:30:03,679 --> 00:30:07,190
at slack divisions last question in the
whole

537
00:30:07,190 --> 00:30:11,000
I think it's kinda Hannah issue death
yeah okay

538
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:14,240
like bad again had a lot of impact a lot
that

539
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:18,450
has a lot of impact on identity issues
and i'm happy to talk about this more

540
00:30:18,450 --> 00:30:19,940
but there's a dude behind you who

541
00:30:19,940 --> 00:30:24,050
want to ask a question actually there
appear to be two dudes behind you

542
00:30:24,050 --> 00:30:27,250
on I don't know if you mention anything
about this bird

543
00:30:27,250 --> 00:30:30,880
it also I would like to counter the
former speaker but there's a

544
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:34,220
DDoS DDoS for higher market out there

545
00:30:34,220 --> 00:30:37,700
and on Lago doubt wills is I mean

546
00:30:37,700 --> 00:30:40,850
various people over providing service
they sell it

547
00:30:40,850 --> 00:30:44,190
through the one with the funny yeah on
YouTube yeah

548
00:30:44,190 --> 00:30:48,170
okay at and you know corporations are
using this

549
00:30:48,170 --> 00:30:51,820
against each other key people in
competition with

550
00:30:51,820 --> 00:30:54,820
each other in business and on if website

551
00:30:54,820 --> 00:30:58,230
if their website goes down they could
potentially use it losing

552
00:30:58,230 --> 00:31:01,460
in a thousand dollars per day so

553
00:31:01,460 --> 00:31:04,770
I mean I don't know if you said anything
about that I wasn't fully paying

554
00:31:04,770 --> 00:31:05,710
attention but

555
00:31:05,710 --> 00:31:09,030
I think that's significant

556
00:31:09,030 --> 00:31:14,240
so what you're describing could not even
begin to be described as dee da says an

557
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:15,429
activist action

558
00:31:15,429 --> 00:31:19,070
so I did not covered in this talk but

559
00:31:19,070 --> 00:31:22,939
you're right in that Diaz is used in
that fashion in that the technological

560
00:31:22,940 --> 00:31:24,310
tool is used

561
00:31:24,310 --> 00:31:27,720
in that way yes you're right but I

562
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:31,760
Joe I would be loath to deal with
generalized a motive civic participation

563
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:33,510
in civic action

564
00:31:33,510 --> 00:31:37,480
because people can use it to bully each
other because frankly I can stand in

565
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:41,070
front of Anne's house with a sign and
yell at him for 20 minutes

566
00:31:41,070 --> 00:31:44,399
and that doesn't do it do it in my
street protest sorry

567
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:47,710
any yeah arm

568
00:31:47,710 --> 00:31:50,820
to go into two guys back okay talk to
you right back I

569
00:31:50,820 --> 00:31:54,360
you guys back talking about the US is
just taking down web sites

570
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:58,740
and coming from a scary operations
center and having clients that have been

571
00:31:58,740 --> 00:32:00,290
targeted before

572
00:32:00,290 --> 00:32:03,570
Justin on the website isn't the only
concern yet and you know that's

573
00:32:03,570 --> 00:32:04,460
something that

574
00:32:04,460 --> 00:32:07,570
year you know that at a disco ball we're
talking about here

575
00:32:07,570 --> 00:32:11,389
but to relate to him you know that solid
enough manpower

576
00:32:11,390 --> 00:32:15,230
I mean there's a call to arms when
although sometimes comes as a

577
00:32:15,230 --> 00:32:18,570
we're going to target you yep you know
that's as a man are that's

578
00:32:18,570 --> 00:32:21,918
you know what to make sure all your
signatures are in place making sure that

579
00:32:21,919 --> 00:32:25,280
you know you have every possibility

580
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:29,139
accounted for just in case that does
happen cases similar security breach

581
00:32:29,140 --> 00:32:33,230
yeah it's not just from the out our
faces well there is that back

582
00:32:33,230 --> 00:32:37,500
and there's more may concern from the
corporate yeah there's a huge cost in

583
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:41,460
man hours when it comes to defending
against iraq attacks when it comes to

584
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:42,550
preparing

585
00:32:42,550 --> 00:32:45,770
and going through all the prep work our

586
00:32:45,770 --> 00:32:51,350
but like I said I would be loath to do
you add you to my eyes a motive civic

587
00:32:51,350 --> 00:32:54,130
engagement because it costs people money

588
00:32:54,130 --> 00:32:57,980
laps like street protests cost cities
money

589
00:32:57,980 --> 00:33:02,630
because all those police officers and
horses and stun guns and

590
00:33:02,630 --> 00:33:07,390
they all cost money but were not be
legitimized street protests

591
00:33:07,390 --> 00:33:11,130
so while I under certain I understand
and sympathize I have many friends who

592
00:33:11,130 --> 00:33:12,700
were in the InfoSec business

593
00:33:12,700 --> 00:33:17,050
%uh that its a real pain in the ass when
this happens

594
00:33:17,050 --> 00:33:20,340
it is also quite widget a min Lee
probably

595
00:33:20,340 --> 00:33:27,340
you can still talk about it as being a
legitimate no to protest

596
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:31,260
as wonder if you might wanna comment at
all on I'm Anna

597
00:33:31,260 --> 00:33:34,890
a DDoS counter activism around the same
time the

598
00:33:34,890 --> 00:33:38,540
people are protesting and a power
everything with the league's itself was

599
00:33:38,540 --> 00:33:39,230
Diaz

600
00:33:39,230 --> 00:33:42,820
yet and I wanted to get your thoughts on
whether you

601
00:33:42,820 --> 00:33:47,120
you thought that the legitimization is
even the prosecution

602
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:50,640
a the the added people participated

603
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:54,919
in the ready legitimizes the prosecution
yes

604
00:33:54,919 --> 00:34:00,250
I think the prosecution is already the
legitimate

605
00:34:00,250 --> 00:34:03,480
I already do not have a lot of sympathy
for people who are using criminal

606
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:06,050
statutes to prosecute political speech

607
00:34:06,050 --> 00:34:12,089
I am that purely my opinion by angry
opinion but it's my opinion

608
00:34:12,089 --> 00:34:16,159
I don't think that the USAID dedust2
target groups like the week said not

609
00:34:16,159 --> 00:34:16,580
amiss

610
00:34:16,580 --> 00:34:21,690
you add you to my tactic this is one of
those

611
00:34:21,690 --> 00:34:24,770
sorry your version up I don't serve I
don't support what you have to say but I

612
00:34:24,770 --> 00:34:26,320
support your right to say it

613
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:30,030
if I'm going to say that Diaz is a
legitimate political action

614
00:34:30,030 --> 00:34:33,750
then it's a legitimate political action
even if people are using it to target

615
00:34:33,750 --> 00:34:37,129
organizations I like and also I'm

616
00:34:37,129 --> 00:34:40,339
I'm pretty sure you're not a lawyer but
I am so not okay

617
00:34:40,339 --> 00:34:44,790
so not a liar I remember yesterday when
the comments are talking about

618
00:34:44,790 --> 00:34:47,889
I want the talks is about I'm

619
00:34:47,889 --> 00:34:50,929
you know it like leaks and how the
administration prosecutes only deletes

620
00:34:50,929 --> 00:34:51,440
it

621
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:55,629
this favors I mean you think there's any
legal theory

622
00:34:55,629 --> 00:34:59,069
similar to that with that you're
prosecuting

623
00:34:59,070 --> 00:35:02,910
people were protesting WikiLeaks been
defunded and

624
00:35:02,910 --> 00:35:06,629
just it not giving a fuck about people
who

625
00:35:06,630 --> 00:35:10,950
when after WikiLeaks I don't think that
they have a legal theory about it I have

626
00:35:10,950 --> 00:35:13,290
a theory about it that happens

627
00:35:13,290 --> 00:35:17,570
a like I've been to a lot of protest or
I got chased by cops and I don't think

628
00:35:17,570 --> 00:35:21,040
anyone at a Tea Party protest has been
chased by cops recently

629
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:28,040
like

630
00:35:28,650 --> 00:35:33,350
a.m. a related question about your your
model for legitimacy

631
00:35:33,350 --> 00:35:39,359
do you think the to the the history in
and consistency of the

632
00:35:39,359 --> 00:35:43,089
the attacks sponsored by any one
particular group are relevant to

633
00:35:43,089 --> 00:35:46,040
legitimacy of that group activities as a
whole

634
00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:49,240
net I'm considering anonymous
specifically

635
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:52,609
you have things like I i think within

636
00:35:52,609 --> 00:35:56,500
a month or two love the a.m the
WikiLeaks related stuff

637
00:35:56,500 --> 00:36:00,359
they were doing things like declaring
war on the Weather Channel over the

638
00:36:00,359 --> 00:36:03,359
place you live 2011

639
00:36:03,359 --> 00:36:07,200
I've personally to stop but the closer
to that level I was in california and I

640
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:10,130
you live in Boston and I totally missed
all the snow

641
00:36:10,130 --> 00:36:15,400
and I was upset I think that the history
a group does have an effect on alleged

642
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:18,760
with the gym achieve a tactic it's
difficult when you start talking about

643
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:20,250
anonymous because the

644
00:36:20,250 --> 00:36:24,210
history even on a missus so up and down
all the time that people who are

645
00:36:24,210 --> 00:36:27,109
participating last week are
participating next week

646
00:36:27,109 --> 00:36:30,890
and peer nodes up endorsing different
actions are very

647
00:36:30,890 --> 00:36:33,940
you are equally helter skelter yeah so
been on a mission

648
00:36:33,940 --> 00:36:37,520
feels a lot like they just said randomly
flail around in his things and

649
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:39,770
occasionally they hit something that
deserves to be here

650
00:36:39,770 --> 00:36:43,210
if you wanna talk about anonymous I
highly suggest tracking down

651
00:36:43,210 --> 00:36:46,450
when you're who is somewhere at this
conference and talking to her because

652
00:36:46,450 --> 00:36:48,510
she knows way more about it than I do

653
00:36:48,510 --> 00:36:52,089
arches over there

654
00:36:52,089 --> 00:36:57,130
I mmm I just wanted to give like a.m.
real-life

655
00:36:57,130 --> 00:37:00,820
in color contrast am so there are

656
00:37:00,820 --> 00:37:04,370
aids activists that shut down drug
factories

657
00:37:04,370 --> 00:37:09,410
and a few years ago there is a group
called act-up Paris that shut down

658
00:37:09,410 --> 00:37:12,529
on needs drug factory

659
00:37:12,530 --> 00:37:18,150
in France because the company was not
lowering its prices in allowing people

660
00:37:18,150 --> 00:37:21,650
developing countries to get that tried
so they were dying aids

661
00:37:21,650 --> 00:37:25,410
shut it down for three weeks and they
were like no arrests

662
00:37:25,410 --> 00:37:28,529
me there's like a slap on the hand so
just to think about what

663
00:37:28,530 --> 00:37:33,310
him money was involved and what kind
rethink publicity was involved

664
00:37:33,310 --> 00:37:37,549
and really refer to reno repercussions
there in a negative repercussions at all

665
00:37:37,550 --> 00:37:39,240
for that organization

666
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:42,690
yep that's one of the really interesting
things about

667
00:37:42,690 --> 00:37:46,980
Iran protests is that has a history

668
00:37:46,980 --> 00:37:52,020
%uh legitimate legitimacy street
protests have a history of legitimacy

669
00:37:52,020 --> 00:37:55,100
the street is viewed as some place where
you can stand with your sign

670
00:37:55,100 --> 00:37:59,009
and scream and shout and hold up traffic
because the street is viewed as a public

671
00:37:59,010 --> 00:38:00,000
venue

672
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:04,060
there is no equivalent public venue on
the Internet

673
00:38:04,060 --> 00:38:07,970
I there is no street on the internet
there's no where I can stand up a sign

674
00:38:07,970 --> 00:38:09,859
and make a big bus

675
00:38:09,859 --> 00:38:14,200
this is a huge problem when it comes to
live be perceived legitimacy of online

676
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:15,440
activism

677
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:18,920
is a good point but also just I just me
is actually private property

678
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:22,620
in mean what you say is true but also in
the case of a drug company it's actually

679
00:38:22,620 --> 00:38:23,750
the property yet

680
00:38:23,750 --> 00:38:28,000
yeah but if I can mess up to the front
to the back at the white house

681
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:31,690
I'll probably get arrested because it's
really irritating a happy chain to the

682
00:38:31,690 --> 00:38:34,150
front gate at the white house with
people need to let go in and out

683
00:38:34,150 --> 00:38:38,880
stuff but I'll also probably be released
within 24 hours and I probably won't be

684
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:40,109
charged anything because

685
00:38:40,109 --> 00:38:44,130
that publicly perceived popularly
perceived to be a legitimate protest

686
00:38:44,130 --> 00:38:44,800
tactic

687
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:48,310
by participate in the DoS attack and
White House dot gov

688
00:38:48,310 --> 00:38:55,310
that's a totally different legal issue

689
00:38:56,260 --> 00:39:00,339
by a price I have like a two part
question I first saw that ask you about

690
00:39:00,339 --> 00:39:05,580
um in regards to like 2600 in this be in
their community and so on

691
00:39:05,580 --> 00:39:09,759
what about activists using the same
tactics against their own community that

692
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:10,890
supports them

693
00:39:10,890 --> 00:39:15,240
and so on and so forth in regards to
like de dos de our website at: tossing

694
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:18,520
RC services and so on and so forth how
do you feel about that

695
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:21,990
as I previously stated if I am going to
support de da

696
00:39:21,990 --> 00:39:25,020
as a valid political activism tactic

697
00:39:25,020 --> 00:39:28,670
I have to support it when people use it
against people that I like

698
00:39:28,670 --> 00:39:32,520
okay even if it censorship across the
board and if it followed that fall

699
00:39:32,520 --> 00:39:36,410
any censorship part of my analysis it's
going to fall in there whether or not I

700
00:39:36,410 --> 00:39:38,270
like the people that they're targeting

701
00:39:38,270 --> 00:39:43,220
sure I can't say this is my home made
these are my peoples therefore you're a

702
00:39:43,220 --> 00:39:46,130
big jerk and I don't like you even
though

703
00:39:46,130 --> 00:39:50,120
you bit in with the other with how I
would originally analyze he was being

704
00:39:50,120 --> 00:39:50,859
balloted

705
00:39:50,859 --> 00:39:54,900
sure so with that also include using
criminal organizations to

706
00:39:54,900 --> 00:39:59,520
fulfill your political gain with taxes
lol that falls under the

707
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:02,910
what are the technology is being used
part of the analysis

708
00:40:02,910 --> 00:40:05,960
so in the case is the IGCC action

709
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:10,190
the user mail bombing tactics affects a
lot of people

710
00:40:10,190 --> 00:40:13,350
far more than people you were initially
targeting and it directly attacks the

711
00:40:13,350 --> 00:40:16,210
ability of individuals to communicate
with other people

712
00:40:16,210 --> 00:40:20,070
which in my view is and is an ethical
and helps to deliver to my

713
00:40:20,070 --> 00:40:23,480
attacked it the use I'll criminal botnet

714
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:26,510
and yousef non-violent here botnet

715
00:40:26,510 --> 00:40:29,589
heavily affects the legitimacy of a
tactic

716
00:40:29,589 --> 00:40:32,799
even if you enable in criminal
organizations and

717
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:37,060
legitimizing the criminal organizations
for your own political gain

718
00:40:37,060 --> 00:40:41,049
so the reason why I think that the use
criminal botnet

719
00:40:41,049 --> 00:40:46,569
deal engine light is a tactic is because
you have taken a huge step away from

720
00:40:46,569 --> 00:40:50,240
the volunteer defense you take a huge
that way from being this is the way to

721
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:51,480
the people to being

722
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:54,990
this is the voice of the people and a
buncha computers that we kidnapped

723
00:40:54,990 --> 00:40:58,180
and thats

724
00:40:58,180 --> 00:41:02,549
I that's not really okay with me if
you're going to makeup popular stand

725
00:41:02,549 --> 00:41:07,190
and if the force that your argument is
going to be based on popular disapproval

726
00:41:07,190 --> 00:41:11,190
which is essentially what it do not
attack should be in its most

727
00:41:11,190 --> 00:41:14,540
its purest form then you can't be

728
00:41:14,540 --> 00:41:19,400
you you can't be co-op doing other
people's voices without their consent

729
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:22,790
church a congruence there's another

730
00:41:22,790 --> 00:41:25,960
to your question I may not understand
your question male lecture

731
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:32,960
happy thanks we can talk later

732
00:41:35,359 --> 00:41:38,569
I'm I'd I'm the so

733
00:41:38,569 --> 00:41:42,159
you've been saying I would like to thank
some would disagree with me

734
00:41:42,159 --> 00:41:46,439
have been sitting there different data
art and trying to come up with the

735
00:41:46,439 --> 00:41:49,509
curveball hardest curveball questions

736
00:41:49,509 --> 00:41:53,140
import their I'm the visit was commit

737
00:41:53,140 --> 00:41:56,609
going to come up with is not so much
about the enormous itself which is a

738
00:41:56,609 --> 00:41:57,578
great perfection

739
00:41:57,579 --> 00:42:02,429
with more about on how important the
topic

740
00:42:02,429 --> 00:42:07,249
is at all so my question would be
waterworks

741
00:42:07,249 --> 00:42:13,159
you have worked on and whatever works
you could have worked own

742
00:42:13,159 --> 00:42:17,099
and why did you choose this much for
talking where I worked on personal

743
00:42:17,099 --> 00:42:20,469
yet and why did you choose this
particular topic and

744
00:42:20,469 --> 00:42:24,469
what do you hope will be the impact on
the activist community

745
00:42:24,469 --> 00:42:28,029
afterward a big do you want this
refreshing to be

746
00:42:28,029 --> 00:42:32,499
so be 4i was a graduate MIT I was a
research assistant

747
00:42:32,499 --> 00:42:35,789
at the Berkman Center Francis I and
while I was

748
00:42:35,789 --> 00:42:41,130
a research assistant there I in a week I
was supposed to take the LSATs

749
00:42:41,130 --> 00:42:45,079
Cablegate happened and all this stuff
went down

750
00:42:45,079 --> 00:42:49,179
and I basically spent that we sleeping
for hours a night

751
00:42:49,179 --> 00:42:52,339
working with my boss learning everything
I possibly could about

752
00:42:52,339 --> 00:42:55,359
WikiLeaks Cablegate anonymous the deed
of a tad

753
00:42:55,359 --> 00:42:58,939
and then took my LSATs and probably bomb
them and

754
00:42:58,939 --> 00:43:02,009
in it had and

755
00:43:02,009 --> 00:43:05,979
this topic never stop being interesting
it didn't stop being interesting to me

756
00:43:05,979 --> 00:43:06,649
because I'm

757
00:43:06,649 --> 00:43:10,649
really interested in figuring out how
civil disobedience

758
00:43:10,649 --> 00:43:14,328
functions online because the online
space

759
00:43:14,329 --> 00:43:18,909
is in tirely privatize entirely proper
ties there are no

760
00:43:18,909 --> 00:43:22,789
public spaces available online for me to
stand with my sin

761
00:43:22,789 --> 00:43:26,039
and shout about things and I believe
there should be

762
00:43:26,039 --> 00:43:30,419
I believe that political action on line
should be as legitimate as political

763
00:43:30,419 --> 00:43:31,598
action offline

764
00:43:31,599 --> 00:43:36,799
because frankly I spend 18 hours a day
online

765
00:43:36,799 --> 00:43:39,859
I'm a grad student that's what I do all
the time

766
00:43:39,859 --> 00:43:44,509
so now I'm working on this I am also
working with even zukerman at the centre

767
00:43:44,509 --> 00:43:46,209
visited media on a more

768
00:43:46,209 --> 00:43:49,209
broadly based review digital activism

769
00:43:49,209 --> 00:43:54,359
on an international scale less sorta
angry than this

770
00:43:54,359 --> 00:43:59,299
but more perhaps mainstream or rental
religion activism but I'm also working

771
00:43:59,299 --> 00:43:59,949
on that

772
00:43:59,949 --> 00:44:03,469
I also do a lot of work about the
fictions Packers in the media

773
00:44:03,469 --> 00:44:06,579
because I think that's really
interesting and it gives me an excuse to

774
00:44:06,579 --> 00:44:07,119
watch

775
00:44:07,119 --> 00:44:10,359
dozens of movies that hackers in like
two weeks

776
00:44:10,359 --> 00:44:13,788
which is super fun that anti-russian

777
00:44:13,789 --> 00:44:18,289
and when word about the impact your book
have frankly I hope that the impact in

778
00:44:18,289 --> 00:44:22,119
this research is to get people to think
seriously about the legitimacy of the

779
00:44:22,119 --> 00:44:23,139
doctor the tactic

780
00:44:23,139 --> 00:44:26,819
because I think that people do you start
up automatically sort themselves into

781
00:44:26,819 --> 00:44:27,130
you

782
00:44:27,130 --> 00:44:31,739
know it's censorship and it's wrong or
know if the sedan it's totally awesome

783
00:44:31,739 --> 00:44:34,679
because hey they let people sitting at
lunch counters

784
00:44:34,679 --> 00:44:39,649
and I think that both the those draw on
mistaken assumptions about the docs and

785
00:44:39,649 --> 00:44:41,808
mistaken assumptions about activism in
general

786
00:44:41,809 --> 00:44:45,239
and need to be reconsidered that's right

787
00:44:45,239 --> 00:44:51,869
will come out of this think when he make
up for

788
00:44:51,869 --> 00:44:55,939
collateral damage because very few
details attacks only the site

789
00:44:55,939 --> 00:44:59,578
that they're targeting right friends and
neighbors sitting on the same networks

790
00:44:59,579 --> 00:45:02,689
or sir by the same I S these will often

791
00:45:02,689 --> 00:45:07,469
experience in the air degradation
service levels

792
00:45:07,469 --> 00:45:10,729
just entire 10 yep so

793
00:45:10,729 --> 00:45:15,259
collateral damage happens I think it
should be group into the actual affects

794
00:45:15,259 --> 00:45:20,339
part in the analysis but as long as I
like little damage well damn it also

795
00:45:20,339 --> 00:45:21,929
happened during street protests

796
00:45:21,929 --> 00:45:26,419
people's gardenias get trampled I can't
get to my office on time

797
00:45:26,419 --> 00:45:30,449
I get inconvenienced by the fact that
there are several thousand people

798
00:45:30,449 --> 00:45:31,989
walking down Main Street

799
00:45:31,989 --> 00:45:35,559
expressing their political views and a
constitutionally-protected matter

800
00:45:35,559 --> 00:45:39,149
but I had a meeting at 9 a.m. and I'm
going to be late so

801
00:45:39,149 --> 00:45:42,788
collateral damage happened every time we
decide

802
00:45:42,789 --> 00:45:46,479
that someone's right to express their
political views

803
00:45:46,479 --> 00:45:50,979
should be prioritized and protected over
my right to get to my meeting

804
00:45:50,979 --> 00:45:55,859
so this is a trade-off we make in a lots
a protest situations

805
00:45:55,859 --> 00:45:59,439
and should not automatically deal in
Jeddah my

806
00:45:59,439 --> 00:46:02,489
this type of action should be considered
like

807
00:46:02,489 --> 00:46:06,099
if I make impossible for 13,000 people
to access their

808
00:46:06,099 --> 00:46:09,699
email maybe that should weigh a little
heavier

809
00:46:09,699 --> 00:46:13,009
but if I slow down traffic to a group

810
00:46:13,009 --> 00:46:16,089
website a little bit maybe that's the
way a little later

811
00:46:16,089 --> 00:46:19,929
right we don't know though in advance
lead us is who will be affected

812
00:46:19,929 --> 00:46:23,880
months yes with street protests

813
00:46:23,880 --> 00:46:27,429
clearer you know it's these shops down
this treatment can have some sense

814
00:46:27,429 --> 00:46:30,759
whether or not critical trip you're
absolutely correct

815
00:46:30,759 --> 00:46:33,849
I still don't think it should you add
you to my that the tactic right off the

816
00:46:33,849 --> 00:46:36,429
bat

817
00:46:36,429 --> 00:46:40,919
I my question isn't even to suggest that
we should be legitimized as a tactic

818
00:46:40,919 --> 00:46:42,509
might concern

819
00:46:42,509 --> 00:46:46,519
and is are they having the desired
effect

820
00:46:46,519 --> 00:46:50,239
because the impression that I get
outside the community is that when you

821
00:46:50,239 --> 00:46:51,839
say that you're a hacker

822
00:46:51,839 --> 00:46:54,889
the responses I'll see you break stuff
that's like

823
00:46:54,889 --> 00:46:58,869
all actually do it. I try to fix stuff I
do sometimes break stuff

824
00:46:58,869 --> 00:47:02,509
sometimes intentionally mostly by
accident but

825
00:47:02,509 --> 00:47:07,199
but depends a.m. but my point is that
the public perception so that's the

826
00:47:07,199 --> 00:47:08,219
perception

827
00:47:08,219 --> 00:47:12,389
are you really having the desired effect
or you just being a nuisance and turning

828
00:47:12,389 --> 00:47:14,319
people against you because for me

829
00:47:14,319 --> 00:47:18,279
I agree with you its if it is an
effective attack strategically

830
00:47:18,279 --> 00:47:21,589
you know the Predator drones are
strategically effective

831
00:47:21,589 --> 00:47:25,799
but if they cause so much collateral
damage in civilian lives

832
00:47:25,799 --> 00:47:29,389
it turns the population against us and
the net affect

833
00:47:29,389 --> 00:47:33,650
is a loss while we might get two more
baddies per week

834
00:47:33,650 --> 00:47:37,929
with turning we're making things worse
for those Predator drones some

835
00:47:37,929 --> 00:47:41,159
I'm positing teal not the legitimacy

836
00:47:41,159 --> 00:47:45,869
yes supports its used in a certain way
and it's getting us the desired results

837
00:47:45,869 --> 00:47:50,239
raising awareness about up corporate
responsibility in a way that actually

838
00:47:50,239 --> 00:47:52,249
makes people where the issue

839
00:47:52,249 --> 00:47:55,819
then that's great but is shutting down
someone's email

840
00:47:55,819 --> 00:47:59,849
really a make making them aware the
issues connected to say ya whose

841
00:47:59,849 --> 00:48:01,650
responsibility to

842
00:48:01,650 --> 00:48:06,809
protect privacy or is it just sounds for
in hackers again I can't get to me

843
00:48:06,809 --> 00:48:10,689
you know like like that's my concern is
just is this working

844
00:48:10,689 --> 00:48:14,199
so the issue that you're bringing up
which is the popular perception a

845
00:48:14,199 --> 00:48:15,739
Packers as

846
00:48:15,739 --> 00:48:20,499
as I recently wrote adolescent boys in
basements to take out their angst

847
00:48:20,499 --> 00:48:23,829
about every branch having it you know
about not having any dates on the body

848
00:48:23,829 --> 00:48:24,699
politic

849
00:48:24,699 --> 00:48:27,880
I is a much bigger problem has been
around

850
00:48:27,880 --> 00:48:31,650
far longer than the popular use a deed
of activism

851
00:48:31,650 --> 00:48:35,459
and frankly you have Morgan argument
with

852
00:48:35,459 --> 00:48:39,400
movies like die-hard live free or die
hard

853
00:48:39,400 --> 00:48:45,359
then necessarily people who are trying
to use the docs in an activist context

854
00:48:45,359 --> 00:48:49,839
yeah and month so my concern with the

855
00:48:49,839 --> 00:48:53,019
but what will they think about argument
is

856
00:48:53,019 --> 00:48:56,529
I don't want to be in the business
shutting down

857
00:48:56,529 --> 00:49:00,819
outlets a political speech because I'm
worried about what someone is going to

858
00:49:00,819 --> 00:49:02,499
think of me and my friends

859
00:49:02,499 --> 00:49:06,279
I think the Internet is far too valuable
and technology is far too valuable a

860
00:49:06,279 --> 00:49:07,099
tool

861
00:49:07,099 --> 00:49:11,179
for political participation and
political speech and political protests

862
00:49:11,179 --> 00:49:15,179
and disruptive political protest which
should be legitimized

863
00:49:15,179 --> 00:49:18,789
then me worrying about what

864
00:49:18,789 --> 00:49:22,859
the Joneses down the street think me but
what the Joneses down the street think

865
00:49:22,859 --> 00:49:24,759
is the only point the point is to

866
00:49:24,759 --> 00:49:28,789
just a great if the point is to get
media coverage to raise awareness

867
00:49:28,789 --> 00:49:33,579
if the the purpose activism is to get
people to agree with us on point AARP

868
00:49:33,579 --> 00:49:38,069
so if are action makes everyone disagree
with us on point A or B

869
00:49:38,069 --> 00:49:40,999
then it's like we're shooting ourselves
in the foot we might as well be working

870
00:49:40,999 --> 00:49:41,859
for your uncle

871
00:49:41,859 --> 00:49:45,769
and frankly it's viewed as illegitimate
now because it hasn't been around since

872
00:49:45,769 --> 00:49:47,029
outlaw

873
00:49:47,029 --> 00:49:51,169
mincing its religion in saying are we
getting what we want to know what i'm

874
00:49:51,169 --> 00:49:53,808
saying is that it viewed as a legitimate
medal

875
00:49:53,809 --> 00:49:58,009
not that it is a legitimate now but that
it's viewed as a legitimate now

876
00:49:58,009 --> 00:50:01,809
it's viewed as a legitimate now because
it hadn't been around that law

877
00:50:01,809 --> 00:50:05,079
whereas tying yourself to offensive
player nine years after the friend gave

878
00:50:05,079 --> 00:50:05,609
the White House

879
00:50:05,609 --> 00:50:08,799
has been around for about as long as the
white house has been there

880
00:50:08,799 --> 00:50:11,389
and tires up to the front gate
anything's been around for as long as

881
00:50:11,389 --> 00:50:13,739
their main gates

882
00:50:13,739 --> 00:50:17,900
and and I don't and I'm not prevails in
it we're not going to have

883
00:50:17,900 --> 00:50:22,539
this tactic viewed as a legitimate until
we engage in a serious

884
00:50:22,539 --> 00:50:26,359
intellectual interrogation I'll what its
value is

885
00:50:26,359 --> 00:50:29,869
and what been norms and no exhibits you
should be

886
00:50:29,869 --> 00:50:33,239
I agree with that but part of that
question should also be

887
00:50:33,239 --> 00:50:38,349
does chaining yourself to the gate get
your point across and if it does then

888
00:50:38,349 --> 00:50:41,809
let's change ourselves to the gates but
if it's not

889
00:50:41,809 --> 00:50:45,539
getting us what you want then the
problem isn't the legitimacy of the pact

890
00:50:45,539 --> 00:50:46,789
that the problem is

891
00:50:46,789 --> 00:50:50,380
are we being affective in this where is
there a better way to use

892
00:50:50,380 --> 00:50:54,219
media and technology to to get a point
to prices were rising

893
00:50:54,219 --> 00:50:57,519
I didn't have all the undersea actual
affect partner

894
00:50:57,519 --> 00:51:01,299
the and analytical metric I did okay
cool

895
00:51:01,299 --> 00:51:07,679
I'm glad we're still friends edge at
thank you

896
00:51:07,679 --> 00:51:11,119
upbeat all thank you very far off with
humble

897
00:51:11,119 --> 00:51:15,019
your talk was awesome thank you as I
have more comment I think they know

898
00:51:15,019 --> 00:51:19,499
question arm I think that

899
00:51:19,499 --> 00:51:24,119
de dos attacks are still on porn and we
have to do to them

900
00:51:24,119 --> 00:51:28,239
but we should think about doing them in
a two-step process

901
00:51:28,239 --> 00:51:31,949
were like used to before the we

902
00:51:31,949 --> 00:51:35,419
redo adidas attack on somebody intake
some

903
00:51:35,419 --> 00:51:38,429
corporation down to whatever for a
couple of hours

904
00:51:38,429 --> 00:51:41,650
but it was in the press now at press
time is

905
00:51:41,650 --> 00:51:45,419
really really important is that wouldn't
launched a public

906
00:51:45,419 --> 00:51:49,179
so I think we need to think about now is
okay let's

907
00:51:49,179 --> 00:51:53,079
okay we're going to take down target axe

908
00:51:53,079 --> 00:51:57,859
but wanna make sure that the public in
the presidency in

909
00:51:57,859 --> 00:52:01,759
because the nickel have the press but
we'll have a much larger impact than

910
00:52:01,759 --> 00:52:02,809
just like

911
00:52:02,809 --> 00:52:06,130
a bunch of fucking geeks in their
basements

912
00:52:06,130 --> 00:52:09,239
Reina denial of service attack

913
00:52:09,239 --> 00:52:12,819
and that has a much larger fact so

914
00:52:12,819 --> 00:52:16,049
as hackers or activists activist

915
00:52:16,049 --> 00:52:20,309
or whatever you want to call ourselves
today whatever it is this week

916
00:52:20,309 --> 00:52:23,769
you think about that you think alike
it's a two-step process now

917
00:52:23,769 --> 00:52:26,949
like do that action in a figure like

918
00:52:26,949 --> 00:52:31,599
but like holcomb get to the press
because doesn't have much larger X

919
00:52:31,599 --> 00:52:35,039
a large lawyer thing on the bigger brown

920
00:52:35,039 --> 00:52:38,039
things you know i mean i

921
00:52:38,039 --> 00:52:41,119
that's my feeling like me I co-star

922
00:52:41,119 --> 00:52:44,329
you're very right it's like thats what

923
00:52:44,329 --> 00:52:47,380
as hackers are nothing to me people here

924
00:52:47,380 --> 00:52:50,809
there's not a lot of people here which
saw for your talk is great

925
00:52:50,809 --> 00:52:54,119
by like there are more people here than
in any other type but even so

926
00:52:54,119 --> 00:52:58,749
I'm happy but people here that people
that are here listening you talk that

927
00:52:58,749 --> 00:53:02,999
aren't are whatever that are gonna do

928
00:53:02,999 --> 00:53:06,439
guys that involve nudist up that's weird
to think about now it's

929
00:53:06,439 --> 00:53:10,399
you to think about the bigger picture is
no longer just Slyke

930
00:53:10,400 --> 00:53:14,739
I'm gonna hack somebody you gonna put
into the media

931
00:53:14,739 --> 00:53:17,749
in Matt's Wii U that's where we went

932
00:53:17,749 --> 00:53:22,039
yep so the dude with the signs to me
that we have like

933
00:53:22,039 --> 00:53:25,139
five now less than five minutes so if
you have a question

934
00:53:25,139 --> 00:53:28,929
Cup now and I would totally immature to
get getting here Lee

935
00:53:28,929 --> 00:53:32,809
and so it is uncovered and did you talk
about poland at all

936
00:53:32,809 --> 00:53:36,289
I did not talk about Paul would you like
a hot couple %uh no I mean like these

937
00:53:36,289 --> 00:53:39,539
I mean like the during active protests
rage there with

938
00:53:39,539 --> 00:53:43,389
the though when the like Nana skies
masterpiece Parliament

939
00:53:43,389 --> 00:53:46,779
Parliament's website was entertained us
like

940
00:53:46,779 --> 00:53:53,429
at that time yet that's like series
politics analyses business right like

941
00:53:53,429 --> 00:53:56,959
an I don't know like I at circa change
my opinion a little bit

942
00:53:56,959 --> 00:53:59,999
like that this attack singers like I'm

943
00:53:59,999 --> 00:54:03,289
clean on the fence about this slaying
that

944
00:54:03,289 --> 00:54:07,799
it had an impact in kind of helping to
get the tree in the free sample same in

945
00:54:07,799 --> 00:54:13,089
and so alleges sorta kinda force me to
like start asking questions about like

946
00:54:13,089 --> 00:54:17,569
you know kind of a basic questions are
good we like questions

947
00:54:17,569 --> 00:54:20,799
so we can but later I'm very interested
in having the second

948
00:54:20,799 --> 00:54:24,609
female person his acid up to ask
questions is behind you ask a question

949
00:54:24,609 --> 00:54:27,909
site okay

950
00:54:27,909 --> 00:54:31,419
so according to US government at the
moment corporations are people

951
00:54:31,419 --> 00:54:34,949
so any right people such as DDoS the
website

952
00:54:34,949 --> 00:54:38,019
you're technically at the moment which
means may not change sometime in the

953
00:54:38,019 --> 00:54:38,459
future

954
00:54:38,459 --> 00:54:42,059
giving took corporations and delist

955
00:54:42,059 --> 00:54:46,679
DDoS in a website for day and all the
press but it doesn't seem that bad to me

956
00:54:46,679 --> 00:54:50,279
on the other hand if Citibank decided
that really didn't want members up

957
00:54:50,279 --> 00:54:55,159
on the Internet and a and also the
takedown notices they were going to DDoS

958
00:54:55,159 --> 00:54:59,019
every site that mentioned its members

959
00:54:59,019 --> 00:55:03,179
I would be a lot more offended so

960
00:55:03,179 --> 00:55:07,229
right now a bit being like really late
at night I am unwilling to get into a

961
00:55:07,229 --> 00:55:09,199
very fine-grained pursing up this

962
00:55:09,199 --> 00:55:12,769
the Citizens United decision as much
rather leave that to the lawyers that I

963
00:55:12,769 --> 00:55:13,789
work for

964
00:55:13,789 --> 00:55:17,469
I am again though

965
00:55:17,469 --> 00:55:20,939
I do not wanna take rights away from
people because I feel they could be

966
00:55:20,939 --> 00:55:22,428
misused by other people

967
00:55:22,429 --> 00:55:27,589
or other fake people

968
00:55:27,589 --> 00:55:31,099
so you're right this could be using a
disturbing passion

969
00:55:31,099 --> 00:55:34,279
that does not mean that it is
illegitimate in the hands

970
00:55:34,279 --> 00:55:37,509
a actual political activist

971
00:55:37,509 --> 00:55:41,069
but we can get into an argument about
the fine-grained implications of citizen

972
00:55:41,069 --> 00:55:42,769
DNA with Haney later

973
00:55:42,769 --> 00:55:46,089
but if you were to ever make this legal
or

974
00:55:46,089 --> 00:55:50,489
legitimize it in any other way I feel
like with legitimized something much

975
00:55:50,489 --> 00:55:54,949
worse and people who are killing people
and putting the bodies in bags is

976
00:55:54,949 --> 00:55:56,299
horrible

977
00:55:56,299 --> 00:55:59,829
and that that doesn't mean you shouldn't
you know have both men

978
00:55:59,829 --> 00:56:03,769
protection rights third people such an
impact your house

979
00:56:03,769 --> 00:56:07,130
on the other hand something

980
00:56:07,130 --> 00:56:10,999
this big it's not just going to be a
small thing

981
00:56:10,999 --> 00:56:14,159
and computer business it is indeed a
decision doesn't mean that we should

982
00:56:14,159 --> 00:56:18,159
take away the rights of people to give
money to political campaigns

983
00:56:18,159 --> 00:56:22,579
it means that the Citizens United
decision with a shitty decision Ste

984
00:56:22,579 --> 00:56:25,529
but it doesn't mean that we should go
around restricting the rights actual

985
00:56:25,529 --> 00:56:26,779
individuals because they feel

986
00:56:26,779 --> 00:56:33,779
we feel that they could be misused

987
00:56:37,180 --> 00:56:41,300
is there not a point at which you can
miss you something too much that's a

988
00:56:41,300 --> 00:56:42,380
whole nother

989
00:56:42,380 --> 00:56:47,470
philosophical Cano I'm not talking about
it at midnight when I like didn't sleep

990
00:56:47,470 --> 00:56:48,290
last night

991
00:56:48,290 --> 00:56:52,200
we have to stop now thanks everybody

992
00:56:52,200 --> 00:56:52,730
%ah
