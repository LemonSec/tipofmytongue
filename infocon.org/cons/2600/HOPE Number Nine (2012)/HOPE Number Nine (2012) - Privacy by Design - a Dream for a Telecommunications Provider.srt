3
00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:21,680
please give me a moment just gonna plug
this thing and

4
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:28,680

5
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:44,850
me

6
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:50,730
very cool thank you everyone for coming
I would like to start

7
00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:54,260
by saying the word about Lance awesome
in

8
00:00:54,260 --> 00:00:58,409
for whom this room is named today I
first met land

9
00:00:58,409 --> 00:01:01,710
at the 20 73 conference in Berlin

10
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:05,239
and when he came up and spoke to me I
didn't really even know who he was and

11
00:01:05,239 --> 00:01:06,570
it took me quite a while

12
00:01:06,570 --> 00:01:09,970
to figure out that I had this really
amazing conversation with them

13
00:01:09,970 --> 00:01:13,179
I hadn't heard

14
00:01:13,180 --> 00:01:17,550
and you know sorted say something about
that so I just thought I would

15
00:01:17,550 --> 00:01:22,408
start of my talk by mentioning man and
remembering him in all the work that he

16
00:01:22,409 --> 00:01:23,190
did for

17
00:01:23,190 --> 00:01:27,560
privacy and security research to

18
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:32,900
my talk today is called privacy by
design

19
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:36,420
the subtitle is a dream for a
telecommunications provider

20
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:39,460
that uses strong cryptography to ensure
your privacy

21
00:01:39,460 --> 00:01:45,000
to start of

22
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,920
with a little bit of background
information

23
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:52,740
I I'm a native New Yorker

24
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:56,750
I grew up in Manhattan and

25
00:01:56,750 --> 00:02:01,380
when I was a kid 2600 held these
meetings

26
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:07,990
at the citicorp building in Midtown and
I used to go

27
00:02:07,990 --> 00:02:11,200
starring from when I was around a
freshman in high school

28
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:14,239
and the middle are really interesting
people

29
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:19,730
someone from later became infamous I was
introduced to a lot of kind of

30
00:02:19,730 --> 00:02:20,530
rethinking

31
00:02:20,530 --> 00:02:25,050
concepts that weren't taught in school
and I

32
00:02:25,050 --> 00:02:30,140
felt like I said kinda vague knowledge
that because it's not like it's the only

33
00:02:30,140 --> 00:02:31,810
thing that influence me but it was

34
00:02:31,810 --> 00:02:35,709
something that's what added to my world
view and

35
00:02:35,709 --> 00:02:40,590
kind of helps explain a little bit about
my background and how I got here and now

36
00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:43,940
arm and around 1994

37
00:02:43,940 --> 00:02:48,519
when there is a change me there was a
policy change made

38
00:02:48,519 --> 00:02:51,440
with regard to the internet which had
been run by the National Science

39
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:52,700
Foundation and

40
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:55,769
different parts of the government
changes made

41
00:02:55,769 --> 00:02:59,130
and this is where they said that Al Gore
invented the internet

42
00:02:59,130 --> 00:03:04,180
what that really meant there was that
commercial traffic became allowed on the

43
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:05,660
internet for the first time

44
00:03:05,660 --> 00:03:09,920
prior to that it was only research in
education materials allow

45
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:14,600
I kind of saw the writing on the wall at
that point I I thought that there is

46
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:16,410
going to be a big change and

47
00:03:16,410 --> 00:03:20,019
being an idealistic kid mmm

48
00:03:20,019 --> 00:03:23,530
I thought that a I remember thinking
that

49
00:03:23,530 --> 00:03:26,549
that the hurdle the barrier to entry

50
00:03:26,549 --> 00:03:29,829
to get into media in any other way was
was just tremendous

51
00:03:29,829 --> 00:03:33,040
if you want to get into radio or
television

52
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:37,548
that abides multi-million-dollar
licenses and there is also

53
00:03:37,549 --> 00:03:41,030
a limited number them they're all
grandfathered and there were no more

54
00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:41,870
issued

55
00:03:41,870 --> 00:03:45,799
remember thinking wow this is something
that can propel you

56
00:03:45,799 --> 00:03:49,650
to a level where you can broadcast to
everyone with basically no money

57
00:03:49,650 --> 00:03:52,940
and no supervision and no SEC and no

58
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:56,620
regulation for the most part

59
00:03:56,620 --> 00:03:58,270
is a very exciting time

60
00:03:58,270 --> 00:04:01,930
and I started working with a lot of ngos

61
00:04:01,930 --> 00:04:05,220
and nonprofits that we're doing stuff
that I thought was interesting

62
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:09,920
and around 1997

63
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:13,920
I had been during work with NGOs and
nonprofits and I met some Dutch people

64
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:16,739
they're doing basically the exact same
work that I was doing

65
00:04:16,739 --> 00:04:19,959
and we have this kind of idea like why
are we doing

66
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:25,330
the same thing in parallel one we team
up so I started to work with Dutch guys

67
00:04:25,330 --> 00:04:29,400
who were also working with the same
group with NGOs

68
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:33,360
I was working with but in your leader

69
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:38,450
a guy who whose name you might know if
you're a real 2600 reader and you

70
00:04:38,450 --> 00:04:42,550
check out the master there's a guy in a
massive call Bill SF his name is bill

71
00:04:42,550 --> 00:04:44,130
Squires guy from

72
00:04:44,130 --> 00:04:48,210
San Francisco who move to Amsterdam like
25-30 years ago

73
00:04:48,210 --> 00:04:51,299
really amazing packer really amazing guy

74
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:54,440
he ended up becoming part of the company
and it really kinda

75
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:57,820
added to the culture

76
00:04:57,820 --> 00:05:02,460
so to speak arm in 2004

77
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:06,349
I ended up getting strange phone call

78
00:05:06,350 --> 00:05:09,760
the phone rang

79
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:12,889
Monday when are sitting at my desk I
picked it up and caller said they're

80
00:05:12,889 --> 00:05:17,210
coming from the FBI and had a letter for
me

81
00:05:17,210 --> 00:05:19,260
I said okay thanks and I hung up

82
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:22,900
and i'd can assume that maybe i'd get
something in

83
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:27,790
male and the next weaker so but very
soon after there was a knock on the door

84
00:05:27,790 --> 00:05:30,080
like a real heavy you know I'm

85
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:33,359
make serious you know 13 ok and

86
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:37,720
when I open the door there was an actual
isn't there decision came in

87
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:41,910
to give me his letter and I open the
letter in the presence of the Asian

88
00:05:41,910 --> 00:05:44,990
and the letter demanded a handover just
tons of information

89
00:05:44,990 --> 00:05:48,150
reams of information about one of the
clients have the

90
00:05:48,150 --> 00:05:51,990
internet provider which at this time was
more hosting

91
00:05:51,990 --> 00:05:57,560
company and and security consultancy
rather than

92
00:05:57,560 --> 00:06:00,800
hand over the information I ended up
getting

93
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:03,920
caught up in the whole legal battle
against

94
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:08,390
the Patriot Act against as specific
provisions of the Patriot Act called the

95
00:06:08,390 --> 00:06:13,060
National Security Letters provision the
case

96
00:06:13,060 --> 00:06:18,260
was originally filed under seal and
nobody knew what the name it was or

97
00:06:18,260 --> 00:06:21,930
with the plaintiff was what it was about
this is due to the

98
00:06:21,930 --> 00:06:25,620
non disclosure provisions that came with
the letter the letter said that I could

99
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:27,470
never tell anyone that had been
approached

100
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:32,400
ever and when the issue was standing
before me in my office I said

101
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:37,360
to the aging and you'll notice that I
say that the agent I don't say here she

102
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:38,130
and is

103
00:06:38,130 --> 00:06:42,360
reasons for this because I'm still
mostly under nondisclosure

104
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:46,840
thing now and one of the details I'm not
just a discloses the

105
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:50,320
gender agent or what field office they
came from or what day they came from all

106
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:51,340
kinds of mundane

107
00:06:51,340 --> 00:06:55,500
little bits of information many cases
when I

108
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:58,250
when I got the letter opener I got to
the third or fourth paragraph is that I

109
00:06:58,250 --> 00:06:59,370
could never tell anyone

110
00:06:59,370 --> 00:07:03,220
I said to the gym what about my lawyer
and I was like

111
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:07,650
economic migrate to the crux of the the
problem with this letter

112
00:07:07,650 --> 00:07:11,730
like my first be reading a bit the

113
00:07:11,730 --> 00:07:15,460
case and that lasting so long it started
in 2004 and it

114
00:07:15,460 --> 00:07:20,450
kind it was half resolved in 2010 all
through that time I never told anyone

115
00:07:20,450 --> 00:07:22,060
that I was involved in this case

116
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:25,140
not my business partner is not my

117
00:07:25,140 --> 00:07:28,419
clients not my colleagues at my friends
not mine

118
00:07:28,419 --> 00:07:32,250
girlfriend my girlfriends not my name

119
00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:36,360
really anyone but my lawyers I'm

120
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:40,460
it was a really bizarre experience very

121
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:43,560
kind of cough gaskins real because he
was in the news a lot

122
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:47,539
and people that I knew would talk about
the case because

123
00:07:47,539 --> 00:07:51,780
it resulted in the national security
their provisional the featured acting

124
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:52,940
ruled unconstitutional

125
00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:58,050
two times two people were talking about
it but it was always written up as

126
00:07:58,050 --> 00:08:01,810
anonymous ISP Syrian the government and
no

127
00:08:01,810 --> 00:08:05,060
nobody knew it was mean sometimes people
were asking is that you

128
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:08,229
and I i jus I was basically forced to
live because

129
00:08:08,229 --> 00:08:11,640
see no comment I come in

130
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:15,630
encourages people to ask more questions
I'm

131
00:08:15,630 --> 00:08:19,580
in two dozen 6 they modified the Patriot
Act in

132
00:08:19,580 --> 00:08:23,460
response to the judge ruling in a
constitutionally it turned out that the

133
00:08:23,460 --> 00:08:25,970
initial provision violates the First
Amendment

134
00:08:25,970 --> 00:08:30,260
and the fourth amendment and the fifth
amendment the first min

135
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:33,490
being you know freedom of speech

136
00:08:33,490 --> 00:08:38,020
and that's because it came with this
open-ended gag order that

137
00:08:38,020 --> 00:08:42,338
they didn't go to a judge to get
permission for the Fourth Amendment

138
00:08:42,339 --> 00:08:44,320
because it's a search without getting

139
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:47,410
permission from a judge in proven
probable cause

140
00:08:47,410 --> 00:08:52,060
and the fifth minute because there was
no way to challenge it the

141
00:08:52,060 --> 00:08:55,209
letters and I can never tell anyone that
would mean you can't tell lawyer that

142
00:08:55,209 --> 00:08:57,930
would mean you can tell the court clerk
that would mean you can tell a judge in

143
00:08:57,930 --> 00:08:59,000
you can tell anyone

144
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:03,220
then you can exercise your right to go
to court challenge in

145
00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:06,880
of course I did so then they had to
modify the law

146
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:10,260
that that was actually the huge victory
the

147
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:14,200
case what happened after that though is
that it ended up dragging on for years

148
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:15,589
and we are getting argued about

149
00:09:15,589 --> 00:09:19,950
first amendment issues and I kept trying
to get out at the gag

150
00:09:19,950 --> 00:09:24,330
which I personally did only only got my
toe in the door

151
00:09:24,330 --> 00:09:28,070
in 2010 but it brings me to the point
where I can throw talk about

152
00:09:28,070 --> 00:09:34,270
my experience now and in 2007 despite
being under the guy I wrote an op-ed in

153
00:09:34,270 --> 00:09:35,400
the Washington Post

154
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:40,290
I it was the first to bed at the post
ever published as far as I know I'm

155
00:09:40,290 --> 00:09:44,490
I was called my National Security Letter
gag order and you can easily pull it up

156
00:09:44,490 --> 00:09:45,420
on google

157
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:49,589
I because I didn't identify myself

158
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:54,589
it was cool I but here is really a super
Israel

159
00:09:54,589 --> 00:09:57,670
thing because again I'm lot of people
are talking about anyways

160
00:09:57,670 --> 00:10:02,349
itself got coverage The Washington Post
policies never to publish anonymous

161
00:10:02,350 --> 00:10:06,640
pieces but they made an exception in
this case because they had spoken to

162
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:10,970
my lawyers and they knew that it was the
real deal that I wanted to identify

163
00:10:10,970 --> 00:10:13,440
myself but I couldn

164
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:18,880
so again in 2010 I was partially rescind
the gag

165
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:22,750
in August and that winter

166
00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:25,900
I flew to Berlin and I gave a talk there

167
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:29,550
about my whole battle again senate cells

168
00:10:29,550 --> 00:10:33,440
I'm I don't wanna go to to

169
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:36,250
far into the whole story at the National
Security Letter challenge cuz I've

170
00:10:36,250 --> 00:10:39,020
spoken about in the past in if you
really wanna

171
00:10:39,020 --> 00:10:43,010
I see me speak at length about it you
can look at my talk it at 27°c 3 which

172
00:10:43,010 --> 00:10:43,530
is like

173
00:10:43,530 --> 00:10:46,579
on YouTube in various places

174
00:10:46,579 --> 00:10:50,440
on is if you press clippings about

175
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:56,670
I'm the case I like a 100 on that this
is just a a few that I had sitting on my

176
00:10:56,670 --> 00:10:58,150
hard drive summer

177
00:10:58,150 --> 00:11:01,180
I'm was a hotbed in

178
00:11:01,180 --> 00:11:05,130
couple a random articles a

179
00:11:05,130 --> 00:11:07,939
another amazing thing that came out in
this case was that the department

180
00:11:07,940 --> 00:11:10,500
justice in the dock during audits have
its own use and National Security

181
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:11,820
Letters

182
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:14,900
I'm did actually

183
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:18,550
did end up in covering that there is
massive abuse of them

184
00:11:18,550 --> 00:11:22,000
I'm the FBI haden

185
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:26,170
apparently kept records but how many of
them been handed out

186
00:11:26,170 --> 00:11:31,160
are they claim they under counted by 22
percent

187
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:34,240
which I found strange because if they
didn't

188
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:37,500
keep records have been made I was
curious how to come up with such a

189
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:40,890
an exact figures 22 percent

190
00:11:40,890 --> 00:11:45,370
on what happened after that was the

191
00:11:45,370 --> 00:11:48,829
had the FBI got called before Congress
and really got grilled

192
00:11:48,829 --> 00:11:53,320
by both sides republicans were screaming
at him as much as the democrats

193
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:56,430
I'm better

194
00:11:56,430 --> 00:11:59,770
turned out that that there was a
procedure the FBI office in New Yorkers

195
00:11:59,770 --> 00:12:01,120
using

196
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:04,170
in which they were issuing letters
called exigent letters which are

197
00:12:04,170 --> 00:12:06,959
basically saying something like will
come back next week with the National

198
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:08,329
Security Letter we promise

199
00:12:08,329 --> 00:12:11,520
because give us all this data now is in
really terrible emergency

200
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:14,510
in the sky is falling and something
really bad happened to just give it to

201
00:12:14,510 --> 00:12:17,040
us in all the from commuters in okok

202
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:21,150
krieger who turned out in and basically
all these cases that there is no such

203
00:12:21,150 --> 00:12:21,930
emergency

204
00:12:21,930 --> 00:12:25,459
they were just gonna making stuff up as
he went along

205
00:12:25,459 --> 00:12:30,470
unfortunately there are no real regret
percussions from all these

206
00:12:30,470 --> 00:12:34,130
revelations as far as I know

207
00:12:34,130 --> 00:12:37,339
you know FBI said they're going to
handle it somehow internally and and

208
00:12:37,339 --> 00:12:41,410
nobody knows exactly where them

209
00:12:41,410 --> 00:12:45,900
yes I found a sea are you into doing it
on a Freedom of Information Act request

210
00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:49,440
and uncovered a lot of information and I
encourage you if you're interested to

211
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:50,630
know go look it

212
00:12:50,630 --> 00:12:54,870
these reports that they produced on
their side just talking about the abuses

213
00:12:54,870 --> 00:12:58,310
talking about agents coming with post it
notes and and getting tons of

214
00:12:58,310 --> 00:12:58,860
information

215
00:12:58,860 --> 00:13:02,290
with the posting them on

216
00:13:02,290 --> 00:13:05,329
some question that you know I have a lot
of time to think about

217
00:13:05,329 --> 00:13:09,160
what happened afterwards you know it
took me years

218
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:13,829
to understand that a

219
00:13:13,829 --> 00:13:17,220
I I thought that other companies were
probably behind the scenes doing similar

220
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:19,770
things what I was doing I found out that
they weren't

221
00:13:19,770 --> 00:13:23,420
I didn't understand why not give it a
lot of thought I actually sat there

222
00:13:23,420 --> 00:13:25,060
thinking why

223
00:13:25,060 --> 00:13:28,750
why did they are just go along with this
and some other reasons that I come up

224
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:29,860
with him

225
00:13:29,860 --> 00:13:33,510
that seem obvious if you think back to
the time I've liked the beginning of the

226
00:13:33,510 --> 00:13:36,530
war on terror in all the hysteria that
was going on

227
00:13:36,530 --> 00:13:39,939
that there is a great fear PR backlash

228
00:13:39,940 --> 00:13:44,010
companies were worried that if they it
was known that they were

229
00:13:44,010 --> 00:13:47,189
questioning resisting stuff that the
government was doing that customers

230
00:13:47,190 --> 00:13:48,350
would get angry at them in

231
00:13:48,350 --> 00:13:53,150
and walk out her boycott them obviously
there's a river

232
00:13:53,150 --> 00:13:56,309
a vested interest there in terms of that
a lot of companies

233
00:13:56,309 --> 00:13:59,319
the big telcos have a lot of government
contracts that are worth the time and

234
00:13:59,319 --> 00:14:00,540
money

235
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:03,890
so that's clearing the conflict of
interest that might

236
00:14:03,890 --> 00:14:08,980
influence in one way or another arm also
if you know much about the tokoza miss

237
00:14:08,980 --> 00:14:10,170
security people there there

238
00:14:10,170 --> 00:14:14,839
is somewhat of an overlap between top
security officials at the telcos

239
00:14:14,839 --> 00:14:18,110
and tax law enforcement is a lot of X
FBI people and

240
00:14:18,110 --> 00:14:22,260
ex-police who are the people who are
actually receiving National Security

241
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:23,040
Letters and

242
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:27,520
either request for warrantless
wiretapping sir

243
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:31,490
there's kind of like a buddy buddy thing
going on

244
00:14:31,490 --> 00:14:34,870
according to you the FBI general counsel
former

245
00:14:34,870 --> 00:14:39,079
general counsel Valerie Caproni she says
that they felt it was good corporate

246
00:14:39,079 --> 00:14:40,250
citizenship

247
00:14:40,250 --> 00:14:43,300
to go along with whatever the government
aster

248
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:47,980
I guess that's possible arm I was
offended by this letter because

249
00:14:47,980 --> 00:14:52,650
what from what I knew which I can't
disclose

250
00:14:52,650 --> 00:14:55,770
it was obvious to me that that there is
no basis

251
00:14:55,770 --> 00:14:58,990
for this demand for the center and that
the underlying

252
00:14:58,990 --> 00:15:03,020
investigation is bogus fortune I can
tell you why

253
00:15:03,020 --> 00:15:06,339
because if the homegoing non-disclosure
stuff which

254
00:15:06,339 --> 00:15:11,230
you know dates in 2004 it's now 2012 but
I'm still not allowed to talk about it

255
00:15:11,230 --> 00:15:15,160
I am the last thing that happened when I
went to court to challenge the

256
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:18,750
non-disclosure provisioned and I was in
2009

257
00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:21,880
I the FBI should secret evidence to the
judge

258
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:26,209
somehow justifying that the guy go on
but I never got to see what it was in my

259
00:15:26,209 --> 00:15:28,220
lawyers in get to see it either

260
00:15:28,220 --> 00:15:32,319
so we can really make a counter
arguments in Sweden we can see what it

261
00:15:32,319 --> 00:15:33,550
was

262
00:15:33,550 --> 00:15:39,990
I'm later the NSA spying scandal was
revealed

263
00:15:39,990 --> 00:15:43,570
I'm sure you guys all know the story you
know the

264
00:15:43,570 --> 00:15:48,640
technician at AT&T central office blew
the whistle that he saw these guys going

265
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:49,069
into this

266
00:15:49,070 --> 00:15:52,100
secret room in the guys were in Union
and

267
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:57,160
he was pissed off originally about some
union issue but then the more he dogged

268
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:59,420
him we found out that it was there

269
00:15:59,420 --> 00:16:02,540
I think they're splitting the fiber I'm
sure you all know the story so

270
00:16:02,540 --> 00:16:08,209
but this is kinda the background on what
brought me to the place that I'm at

271
00:16:08,210 --> 00:16:11,180
today I was really offended by this I
was really offended that I

272
00:16:11,180 --> 00:16:16,550
worked so hard to comply with the law
and not break the law not disclose

273
00:16:16,550 --> 00:16:19,030
things I was this close for so many
years and then

274
00:16:19,030 --> 00:16:23,500
when all these tacos broke the law their
old just given retroactive immunity

275
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:27,540
really offended me also a

276
00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:31,050
I found out on me in 2010 or 2011

277
00:16:31,050 --> 00:16:34,120
that when I showed up at the ACLU's
office with this

278
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:37,620
passions creamer is the first one that
they never seem

279
00:16:37,620 --> 00:16:41,040
I am do a few notable exceptions

280
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:46,050
quest refused to go along with the
National Security Agency's

281
00:16:46,050 --> 00:16:51,930
spying program somehow the CEO of price
then subsequently ended up in prison

282
00:16:51,930 --> 00:16:55,790
I always wondered morton the deal was
with that

283
00:16:55,790 --> 00:17:02,200
%uh sounded mad as you guys are probably
know

284
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:04,870
question the National Security Letter
that they're gone

285
00:17:04,870 --> 00:17:08,110
which allegedly had something to do with
check out about them

286
00:17:08,110 --> 00:17:11,510
but for the most part a

287
00:17:11,510 --> 00:17:15,439
no toca really has come forward talk
about

288
00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:18,900
what's going on and I'm

289
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:23,059
even ones that have said something like
question like

290
00:17:23,059 --> 00:17:26,149
sonic haven't really done something to
stop it and I was

291
00:17:26,150 --> 00:17:29,700
when I felt like was the most important
thing to do now is why I ended up going

292
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:31,429
to court against the government

293
00:17:31,429 --> 00:17:34,610
trying to overturn his party the Patriot
Act and actually trying to you

294
00:17:34,610 --> 00:17:40,660
challenged the constitutionality these
practices simply just not going along

295
00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:44,500
is worthwhile and it's it's a brilliant
actor but it doesn't change

296
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:48,000
the big picture which was always what I
was after

297
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,299
in the wake of my kids were a
disappointment

298
00:17:51,299 --> 00:17:54,860
from not being able to change everything
I started to think about what else can I

299
00:17:54,860 --> 00:17:55,669
do because

300
00:17:55,669 --> 00:18:00,700
the law of diminishing returns became
quickly apparent to me that

301
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:05,220
the scope of the cases are involved in
was was extremely wide at first

302
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:08,250
American error never earned by the end
we were just talking to my first

303
00:18:08,250 --> 00:18:09,200
amendment rights

304
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:12,870
something as soon as it became apparent
to me was that a CR Union

305
00:18:12,870 --> 00:18:16,380
better I really out there in the
forefront

306
00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:20,280
but their hands are somewhat tired if no
one's gonna come forward talk about

307
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:23,678
what's going on and then be willing to
challenge it along with them

308
00:18:23,679 --> 00:18:29,380
I'm in national security writer he's a
couple years into IAD

309
00:18:29,380 --> 00:18:33,690
I another time diff also challenge the
National Security Letter

310
00:18:33,690 --> 00:18:38,750
and at the time I didn't know who it was
and it took a few years before it became

311
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:43,130
apparent with the other plane to force
ok

312
00:18:43,130 --> 00:18:46,580
Tom most of the time that I was

313
00:18:46,580 --> 00:18:50,030
in the case with them they were just
known as john doe Connecticut and they

314
00:18:50,030 --> 00:18:51,600
were calling me john doe New York

315
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:55,600
I later turned out that there are a
bunch of librarians from connecticut

316
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:58,820
and this was like an extra juicy

317
00:18:58,820 --> 00:19:02,629
ironic piece of info because the
American Library Association have been

318
00:19:02,630 --> 00:19:04,240
going on talking about how r

319
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:07,390
the Patriot Act in section 215 n

320
00:19:07,390 --> 00:19:10,490
the National Security Letter provision
could be used to get library patron

321
00:19:10,490 --> 00:19:11,380
information

322
00:19:11,380 --> 00:19:14,480
and john ashcroft went around a

323
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:18,370
mocking them he literally went on a
nationwide tour we're doing

324
00:19:18,370 --> 00:19:21,790
talks saying that the American Library
Association were nuts

325
00:19:21,790 --> 00:19:26,428
and that they were paranoid and that
they were you know i've seen

326
00:19:26,429 --> 00:19:30,400
things get better behind every tree in
under every rock

327
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:33,870
and then it turned out few years later
that that

328
00:19:33,870 --> 00:19:37,690
the FBI was using the Patriot Act to get
patron records from the library's

329
00:19:37,690 --> 00:19:40,950
arm around that same time

330
00:19:40,950 --> 00:19:44,799
a stories began to appear in the papers
by commercial booksellers

331
00:19:44,799 --> 00:19:47,850
in a Barnes & Noble Amazon those types
are

332
00:19:47,850 --> 00:19:50,570
literally just hanging over reams of
information all the books are people

333
00:19:50,570 --> 00:19:51,980
were buying

334
00:19:51,980 --> 00:19:55,650
and I'm was kinda like a light bulb over
the head moment for me

335
00:19:55,650 --> 00:19:59,820
where I started to think that you know
the the librarians

336
00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:02,850
and the commercial booksellers in a lot
of ways

337
00:20:02,850 --> 00:20:06,309
are in the same business but with just a
vastly different business model ones

338
00:20:06,309 --> 00:20:10,070
nonprofit and could kind of ideological
in one's for profit and

339
00:20:10,070 --> 00:20:13,370
its goal is to make as much money for
its shareholders possible

340
00:20:13,370 --> 00:20:17,450
I am I started to pinch myself

341
00:20:17,450 --> 00:20:21,220
why isn't there are the equivalent of
the LA or the by brings in the

342
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:22,559
telecommunications industry

343
00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:27,340
ok that's when I started to come up with
the idea for this

344
00:20:27,340 --> 00:20:31,309
nonprofit org or provider arm

345
00:20:31,309 --> 00:20:35,820
it's a nonprofit with an educational
charitable purpose I'm

346
00:20:35,820 --> 00:20:39,689
kinda the sub purpose is to promote best
practices with regard to privacy within

347
00:20:39,690 --> 00:20:41,630
the telecommunications industry in

348
00:20:41,630 --> 00:20:45,090
and what we're planning on doing is
building a framework for an internet

349
00:20:45,090 --> 00:20:46,120
provider

350
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:49,710
and a mobile phone provider where all
the best privacy

351
00:20:49,710 --> 00:20:53,169
controls and best practices Big Ten from
the beginning

352
00:20:53,169 --> 00:20:57,570
so that would mean it would comply with
all the BFS best practices for service

353
00:20:57,570 --> 00:21:00,629
providers that would mean it would use
encryption wherever possible

354
00:21:00,630 --> 00:21:03,909
that would mean that it will be an open
framework

355
00:21:03,909 --> 00:21:07,640
with all this was good published and get
Harbor somewhere

356
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:11,700
I so than anyone can audited so that
anyone can contribute go do it

357
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:15,870
I'm and then a of course we're going to
release it

358
00:21:15,870 --> 00:21:18,700
all under an open license

359
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:22,590
and rose again operate a testbed
environment so that anyone

360
00:21:22,590 --> 00:21:26,330
can participate and testing it out
anyone considering

361
00:21:26,330 --> 00:21:30,820
and ham ronit poke at it figure out if
there are problems with it how could be

362
00:21:30,820 --> 00:21:31,960
better

363
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:36,410
the whole goal is to develop a framework
that we can give away

364
00:21:36,410 --> 00:21:40,290
encourage other people to run anywhere
kinda just change the way

365
00:21:40,290 --> 00:21:42,470
telecommunications works to reimagine in

366
00:21:42,470 --> 00:21:45,810
as if a buncha privacy people on
security people had designed it from the

367
00:21:45,810 --> 00:21:46,300
get-go

368
00:21:46,300 --> 00:21:49,710
I am the old

369
00:21:49,710 --> 00:21:54,260
analogy there is was thinking about was
like you know it in the old days before

370
00:21:54,260 --> 00:21:57,490
there was touchdown before retiring

371
00:21:57,490 --> 00:22:00,530
you picked up the handset on your phone
you click the receiver

372
00:22:00,530 --> 00:22:05,240
an operator summer pickup and you think
commitment to doctor johnson

373
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:08,760
something men she would plug cable

374
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:12,060
and then she would be able to listen in
on Holcomb

375
00:22:12,060 --> 00:22:16,280
and the town phone operators always
known as like the person you go to find

376
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:17,629
out where anyone was there to find out

377
00:22:17,630 --> 00:22:22,130
you know what was going on she knew
everything about everywhere you know as

378
00:22:22,130 --> 00:22:25,840
technology move forward me at crossbar
switching electronic switching with all

379
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:26,929
these different systems

380
00:22:26,930 --> 00:22:31,830
everything became digital but in the end
it was still just as transparent as had

381
00:22:31,830 --> 00:22:32,490
been

382
00:22:32,490 --> 00:22:36,660
in 1800 and I started to imagine

383
00:22:36,660 --> 00:22:40,380
you know how could this be done
differently and why do we accept this

384
00:22:40,380 --> 00:22:44,750
I'm in the process started to do lemme

385
00:22:44,750 --> 00:22:47,850
to try to get support for the idea is
I'm around and I talked to people that I

386
00:22:47,850 --> 00:22:48,590
thought were

387
00:22:48,590 --> 00:22:53,730
influential on smarter I'm that would
really help kinda fresh out the idea and

388
00:22:53,730 --> 00:22:57,610
I'm this would've landed

389
00:22:57,610 --> 00:23:00,970
some Gravatar just to to this concept

390
00:23:00,970 --> 00:23:05,300
I am the concept that I'm going for

391
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:08,710
and I'm still it's still a work in
progress is but i wanna bring together

392
00:23:08,710 --> 00:23:09,710
for

393
00:23:09,710 --> 00:23:13,250
group one hasn't come in the open source
in hacker community

394
00:23:13,250 --> 00:23:16,760
ones like the civil liberties community
and and the legal world

395
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:20,650
one is intelligence and law enforcement

396
00:23:20,650 --> 00:23:26,190
and one is the enterprise and those are
the four groups I'm trying to bring

397
00:23:26,190 --> 00:23:27,580
under a big tent

398
00:23:27,580 --> 00:23:30,899
there's still some work to be done I
think but

399
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:34,920
I'm you know I think I have like a
decent

400
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:39,170
assortment right now love people someone
you might know someone who might not

401
00:23:39,170 --> 00:23:45,610
I the addition of blowing snow the
former tech director at an essay was a

402
00:23:45,610 --> 00:23:47,340
really strange thing

403
00:23:47,340 --> 00:23:50,620
I its kinda requires explanation I guess

404
00:23:50,620 --> 00:23:56,640
I am I became friends with the guy who
works at ACLU

405
00:23:56,640 --> 00:24:00,830
who's a retired FBI agent he'd been an
FBI for 25 years

406
00:24:00,830 --> 00:24:04,929
I'm I asked him would he be willing to
be on this advisory board

407
00:24:04,930 --> 00:24:08,550
he said he couldn't because a conflict
of interest rules because at that time I

408
00:24:08,550 --> 00:24:09,399
was still

409
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:12,510
bigger quasi maybe

410
00:24:12,510 --> 00:24:17,060
some soon to be kleiner you know ACLU's
cuz be kept going back in challenging

411
00:24:17,060 --> 00:24:17,470
the

412
00:24:17,470 --> 00:24:22,890
gag provisions he said but I can't do it
but I do know these guidelines know that

413
00:24:22,890 --> 00:24:23,620
you should talk to you

414
00:24:23,620 --> 00:24:28,000
and I didn't know who he was never heard
of him and went home and I googled the

415
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:28,440
guy

416
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:32,660
and make Google Image Search pops up and
the guy see this picture came in here on

417
00:24:32,660 --> 00:24:35,050
his left is def be an israeli home in

418
00:24:35,050 --> 00:24:39,490
name is the minimum like okay these guys
like

419
00:24:39,490 --> 00:24:42,650
pretty heavy so I'm not going down and
meeting with him when I was in

420
00:24:42,650 --> 00:24:44,390
washington won time and I'm

421
00:24:44,390 --> 00:24:48,230
as it turns out he left the agency in
part because

422
00:24:48,230 --> 00:24:53,850
have the same reasons that you may have
heard about at the keynote on Friday

423
00:24:53,850 --> 00:24:57,260
I he was unhappy about

424
00:24:57,260 --> 00:25:01,780
some the south and as he was doing
post-9/11 and he worked

425
00:25:01,780 --> 00:25:05,389
within the agency and tried to a

426
00:25:05,390 --> 00:25:10,850
tried to do as much as he could but at a
certain point he understood that our

427
00:25:10,850 --> 00:25:14,790
there are forces that were bigger than
all that and he ended up retiring early

428
00:25:14,790 --> 00:25:16,020
cuz he didn't

429
00:25:16,020 --> 00:25:20,740
my understanding he didn't feel that he
could stay there

430
00:25:20,740 --> 00:25:24,350
and watch the constitution being

431
00:25:24,350 --> 00:25:27,900
disrespected so it seems like a strange

432
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:31,980
thing but but but I'm kinda going for
strange bedfellows thing

433
00:25:31,980 --> 00:25:35,830
with the Big Ten concept that you could
have

434
00:25:35,830 --> 00:25:38,760
the phone which had ordered an essay
with the present at the ACLU in with

435
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:40,060
Jakob about from

436
00:25:40,060 --> 00:25:43,830
and with Bob are in the same advisory
board to me is like a really powerful

437
00:25:43,830 --> 00:25:47,129
though it seems may be crazy

438
00:25:47,130 --> 00:25:52,060
some level I am also mankind on Earth

439
00:25:52,060 --> 00:25:55,240
trying to get a bunch of partnerships
with organizations that are working in

440
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:55,930
this field

441
00:25:55,930 --> 00:26:00,090
I had broken the law school there's this
amazing blog clinic that does love

442
00:26:00,090 --> 00:26:02,240
telecommunications law work

443
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:06,390
the call bled and the professor there's
a guy called Jonathan askin

444
00:26:06,390 --> 00:26:10,990
who's also on the advisory board he used
to be with the SEC im

445
00:26:10,990 --> 00:26:14,260
I and his father is a general counsel
for the ACLU

446
00:26:14,260 --> 00:26:17,580
remember decades who is coming up one
foot in telecommunications and one in

447
00:26:17,580 --> 00:26:21,970
civil liberties in I'm I've had a really
amazing

448
00:26:21,970 --> 00:26:25,310
meetings and talks to be a factor in
their Super on board

449
00:26:25,310 --> 00:26:29,929
I'm there is also a group called

450
00:26:29,930 --> 00:26:33,290
leap which I'm sure pretty much know
you've heard a

451
00:26:33,290 --> 00:26:38,430
binoculars to birds here but they're
made up by two guys that I know who have

452
00:26:38,430 --> 00:26:39,780
been working in

453
00:26:39,780 --> 00:26:43,910
security and VPN and and

454
00:26:43,910 --> 00:26:48,240
taco stuff for years and along with my
realization were

455
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:52,150
working on developing the platform for
the Internet services

456
00:26:52,150 --> 00:26:55,930
there %uh good

457
00:26:55,930 --> 00:27:00,350
really the an interesting group of guys
probably you know a bunch of them

458
00:27:00,350 --> 00:27:03,470
they don't really have much public
information out there right now

459
00:27:03,470 --> 00:27:07,870
but soon they will and ACLU also

460
00:27:07,870 --> 00:27:11,950
has given me an amazing letter of
recommendation

461
00:27:11,950 --> 00:27:16,530
Guardian project I don't know if you've
heard them but they do amazing phone

462
00:27:16,530 --> 00:27:17,760
crypto work

463
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:21,850
reported it or client to enjoy the I'm

464
00:27:21,850 --> 00:27:25,900
have been putting a lot easier TB
clients insertion SMS encryption

465
00:27:25,900 --> 00:27:29,730
software do a lot of work with I'm

466
00:27:29,730 --> 00:27:34,040
with journalists in with NGOs and not a
different parts of the world

467
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:38,270
and of course you know tower Tom

468
00:27:38,270 --> 00:27:43,200
the concept for the ISP as and it's been
developing

469
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:47,320
design goes to encrypt as much data as
possible on the client side

470
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:51,210
so that only the user or the recipient
can to keep the Dayak

471
00:27:51,210 --> 00:27:55,170
I'm one of the things that I kinda felt
when I got caught up in the whole

472
00:27:55,170 --> 00:27:58,590
and I something was cures to third
parties

473
00:27:58,590 --> 00:28:01,940
there's the FBI in one hand and there's

474
00:28:01,940 --> 00:28:05,750
this client is my internet provider in
the other and I kinda felt like God

475
00:28:05,750 --> 00:28:09,300
the second was a big fight outside a bar
if you like try to charge in between

476
00:28:09,300 --> 00:28:12,130
them and help them apart unit gonna get
hit on both sides and I was kinda what

477
00:28:12,130 --> 00:28:13,590
was happening to me I was getting

478
00:28:13,590 --> 00:28:17,530
come smacked around I felt like I had a
responsibility is to my client and their

479
00:28:17,530 --> 00:28:18,310
privacy

480
00:28:18,310 --> 00:28:21,870
also felt like the FBI was coming down
on me like a ton of bricks

481
00:28:21,870 --> 00:28:25,520
and I didn't like in this was my fault
or anything to do with me

482
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:30,620
so I started to think what why how can I
just remove myself from this equation

483
00:28:30,620 --> 00:28:35,230
and the answer to me is to give the
users the ability to encrypt all other

484
00:28:35,230 --> 00:28:35,780
data

485
00:28:35,780 --> 00:28:39,480
as much as possible so that the telco
doesn't have any visibility into the

486
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:40,220
communications

487
00:28:40,220 --> 00:28:44,780
I mean this I'm I understand how this
hasn't been done up to this point

488
00:28:44,780 --> 00:28:48,600
I am the

489
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:52,290
clam I'm it's a client-server model

490
00:28:52,290 --> 00:28:56,360
so the you're going to a client on your
machine or on your handset or whatever

491
00:28:56,360 --> 00:29:00,540
device you our I'm on a date or being
credited

492
00:29:00,540 --> 00:29:04,560
at going through VPN I'm

493
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:08,419
optional used for the transport layer
because the concept

494
00:29:08,420 --> 00:29:11,620
they were going for you don't have to be
able to trust your carrier

495
00:29:11,620 --> 00:29:15,620
you don't feel the trust arise p I am

496
00:29:15,620 --> 00:29:19,090
we're gonna try to integrate everything
will host it or bridges an exit nodes

497
00:29:19,090 --> 00:29:22,260
said that all the traffic can be merged
together

498
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:25,310
this'll be much more difficult to tell
what's

499
00:29:25,310 --> 00:29:28,889
coming from a provider and was just
random tow truck

500
00:29:28,890 --> 00:29:31,929
I'm and they're also working a bunch of
solutions for

501
00:29:31,929 --> 00:29:36,550
opportunistic current immigration so
that would include like

502
00:29:36,550 --> 00:29:39,960
automatic key distribution in
opportunistic encryption and simplify

503
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:41,550
trust mechanisms in

504
00:29:41,550 --> 00:29:44,740
kinda go there's two make it so that

505
00:29:44,740 --> 00:29:49,390
there are ten steps to do everything
because you're gonna send a PGP email to

506
00:29:49,390 --> 00:29:52,580
someone you have to get their key you
have to dial the turkey you have to

507
00:29:52,580 --> 00:29:56,110
you know trade keys you have to do all
this work before you ever seen the first

508
00:29:56,110 --> 00:29:56,570
email

509
00:29:56,570 --> 00:30:00,860
and this is in part I think why
technology like this hasn't been adopted

510
00:30:00,860 --> 00:30:04,429
you know having he servers and other
stuff is I'm

511
00:30:04,429 --> 00:30:08,840
can have helped a lot because before the
Rockies rivers there is much more manual

512
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:13,360
and butter if this is really can be
adopted by the general public ur

513
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:16,950
by people who are like not technical
people journalists

514
00:30:16,950 --> 00:30:19,990
human rights organizations we have to
configure our

515
00:30:19,990 --> 00:30:23,460
how to simplify and streamline allotted
mister

516
00:30:23,460 --> 00:30:26,740
I'm another

517
00:30:26,740 --> 00:30:30,150
a really interesting application that
we're working on is

518
00:30:30,150 --> 00:30:33,220
is claiming credit cloud storage

519
00:30:33,220 --> 00:30:37,860
kinda like Dropbox but done reich

520
00:30:37,860 --> 00:30:41,840
so to speak I and my cuz him to have
that is also

521
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:46,420
climbing could to the email and I'm
again

522
00:30:46,420 --> 00:30:50,790
summer though stuff that's happening
with the surveillance these days is

523
00:30:50,790 --> 00:30:55,060
that all data is being stored in the
cloud

524
00:30:55,060 --> 00:30:59,080
but you know particularly may let stored
in the cloud

525
00:30:59,080 --> 00:31:02,699
has no protection at all after 90 days
pretty much not ever knows this but

526
00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:05,800
there is this river cut-off point

527
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:09,150
codified in law and

528
00:31:09,150 --> 00:31:12,760
only know but scored more than 90 days
doesn't even require more

529
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:16,750
it's only the freshest email it does I
am

530
00:31:16,750 --> 00:31:19,980
as a provider I don't ever wanna be
asked for the persons in for

531
00:31:19,980 --> 00:31:23,580
I kinda think if someone wants that info
whether it's whether it's a hacker

532
00:31:23,580 --> 00:31:25,310
rather it's

533
00:31:25,310 --> 00:31:28,780
someone involved in the civil suit with
them whether it's

534
00:31:28,780 --> 00:31:32,300
anyone any third party I think we need
to go to the user

535
00:31:32,300 --> 00:31:35,700
get it from them

536
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:39,080
so then more so with the more
interesting parts

537
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:42,360
but this system die XP system

538
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:46,150
is confederation in that we are gonna
design it so that if

539
00:31:46,150 --> 00:31:49,960
other people are running the same system
that our traffic that's destined

540
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:52,960
for the different providers will be
automatically encrypt it

541
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:57,880
sort of actually creates for the larger
Cloudera larger/darker

542
00:31:57,880 --> 00:32:01,880
a from the mobile side

543
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:05,929
them i'm looking at basically a.m. and
Vienna model

544
00:32:05,929 --> 00:32:10,500
meaning that a I'm not going to be
putting up in eight hours I'm not going

545
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:12,440
to really build an infrastructure

546
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:16,540
I want to piggyback on existing towers
existing infrastructure but

547
00:32:16,540 --> 00:32:19,990
use all kinds of security techniques and
an encryption

548
00:32:19,990 --> 00:32:23,750
sorted mitigate the fact that I'm
allowing customer data for the third

549
00:32:23,750 --> 00:32:24,530
party Hans

550
00:32:24,530 --> 00:32:27,580
I'm so

551
00:32:27,580 --> 00:32:31,270
what that means essentially is curating
question security tools

552
00:32:31,270 --> 00:32:36,290
bpm coming months toward finances your
GP encryption included as a mass

553
00:32:36,290 --> 00:32:40,149
building from means probably based on
Android

554
00:32:40,150 --> 00:32:43,320
that will have on security tools build
'em

555
00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:47,220
so that everything is on by default Tom

556
00:32:47,220 --> 00:32:51,320
and then one really important point here
as an arbiter

557
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:56,439
has been created by the customer on
their own device partisan the reason why

558
00:32:56,440 --> 00:32:57,490
that's so important

559
00:32:57,490 --> 00:33:01,980
is because it is la called cali a which
may be heard as maybe you have been

560
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:06,020
but it's a law that basically forces
telco providers to

561
00:33:06,020 --> 00:33:10,120
put back doors in all their equipment so
that law enforcement can listen

562
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:13,850
fortunately at least at the moment

563
00:33:13,850 --> 00:33:17,870
and this may change as to keep proposing
changes to it

564
00:33:17,870 --> 00:33:23,669
allows you to not too good today if you
give you the provider don't have the

565
00:33:23,669 --> 00:33:24,270
keys

566
00:33:24,270 --> 00:33:27,660
I'm argument that morning in a minute

567
00:33:27,660 --> 00:33:31,330
Tom so

568
00:33:31,330 --> 00:33:35,350
portamento best-practices approach to
this thing is to do flat rate billing

569
00:33:35,350 --> 00:33:40,270
because part of what's so troublesome
about the way that the total system has

570
00:33:40,270 --> 00:33:43,040
worked for so many years is that by bill
in Bicol

571
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:45,940
going to put his massive database a
everything that a better person is done

572
00:33:45,940 --> 00:33:46,820
every call

573
00:33:46,820 --> 00:33:52,120
missus you're really missing for data
mining it's really amazing for

574
00:33:52,120 --> 00:33:56,559
you know for marketing purposes but it
also creates a huge

575
00:33:56,559 --> 00:34:01,340
problem where every database you create
like that is

576
00:34:01,340 --> 00:34:05,280
is going to be. abused eventually as
we've seen

577
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:09,310
and the section have created I mentioned
earlier

578
00:34:09,310 --> 00:34:13,859
this section 103 b3m because the
telecommunications carrier shall not be

579
00:34:13,859 --> 00:34:15,560
responsible for decoding

580
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:19,600
or ensuring the government's ability to
create any communications and created by

581
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:21,460
subscriber or customer

582
00:34:21,460 --> 00:34:25,010
and lesbian Christians provided by the
carrier misses the key part

583
00:34:25,010 --> 00:34:27,960
and the carrier possesses the
information necessary to keep the

584
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:28,949
communication

585
00:34:28,949 --> 00:34:32,379
this is what I'm trying to make
everything being created by the

586
00:34:32,379 --> 00:34:36,639
customer on their own device and not
have any kind of key escrow

587
00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:40,230
not have any at the customer keys ever
fall into the possession and

588
00:34:40,230 --> 00:34:43,899
provider arm

589
00:34:43,899 --> 00:34:47,399
so ok iron

590
00:34:47,399 --> 00:34:51,569
door are a few ways you can help I read

591
00:34:51,570 --> 00:34:56,139
I just complete with a fundraising
campaign a crowd-sourced fundraising

592
00:34:56,139 --> 00:34:56,830
campaign

593
00:34:56,830 --> 00:35:01,900
I would raise seventy thousand dollars
and I in small donations like 10 20 even

594
00:35:01,900 --> 00:35:06,450
fifty dollars mostly there were a few
thousand dollars a few 2500 butter

595
00:35:06,450 --> 00:35:10,450
basically I need to raise couple million
dollars to build a facility

596
00:35:10,450 --> 00:35:14,060
if you want to contribute money to our
founding drive

597
00:35:14,060 --> 00:35:18,830
the address is right there are two go to
the calcs Institute site is a donate

598
00:35:18,830 --> 00:35:19,420
button

599
00:35:19,420 --> 00:35:24,340
%uh if you can introduce us to enable
the music you know anyone's got a lot of

600
00:35:24,340 --> 00:35:27,210
money that believes in privacy in the
constitution

601
00:35:27,210 --> 00:35:30,520
I want to see things change and I

602
00:35:30,520 --> 00:35:33,310
I don't think we should be discouraged
and think that we can change things I

603
00:35:33,310 --> 00:35:34,400
think that we really can

604
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:39,760
it doesn't take I move this stuff is
mindboggling this is just taking like

605
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:43,250
one thing that is just another thing is
a since I'm in together and make make

606
00:35:43,250 --> 00:35:44,250
something new at it

607
00:35:44,250 --> 00:35:48,880
I anyone who is an experienced
development director they can help us

608
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:49,820
get grants

609
00:35:49,820 --> 00:35:53,750
please introduce us if you can help us
get a grant from somewhere if you were

610
00:35:53,750 --> 00:35:55,340
gonna grab giving organization

611
00:35:55,340 --> 00:36:00,300
please get in touch with me I'm as I
said earlier we doing this all is an

612
00:36:00,300 --> 00:36:01,600
open source project

613
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:06,100
and I if you're a coder if this is your
field

614
00:36:06,100 --> 00:36:09,460
this is your specialty you can
contribute to this we would love to have

615
00:36:09,460 --> 00:36:13,440
as many people look at what we're doing
in critiquing add something to it

616
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:17,380
give us constructive criticism give us
ideas

617
00:36:17,380 --> 00:36:21,550
I could follow us on Twitter obviously
it can to keep

618
00:36:21,550 --> 00:36:25,820
up with our progress and was released
the software

619
00:36:25,820 --> 00:36:28,839
if you're kind of natural minded person

620
00:36:28,839 --> 00:36:33,200
you can start your own eyes peering VPN
provider your mobile provider using our

621
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:34,420
software

622
00:36:34,420 --> 00:36:38,359
and that's really a bad angle here is to
try to transform a telecommunications

623
00:36:38,359 --> 00:36:38,940
industry

624
00:36:38,940 --> 00:36:42,770
to the extent that we can actually get

625
00:36:42,770 --> 00:36:46,400
some significant portion of the American
public using privacy

626
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:49,830
focus telecommunication services it will
create

627
00:36:49,830 --> 00:36:54,009
basically a business case for the big
telcos which will make them realize that

628
00:36:54,010 --> 00:36:55,790
there is a market for privacy

629
00:36:55,790 --> 00:36:59,859
which has been ignoring up until now a

630
00:36:59,859 --> 00:37:04,529
minute things that I granite you con

631
00:37:04,530 --> 00:37:07,850
dollars a problem for me is trying to
just put together the plan for this

632
00:37:07,850 --> 00:37:08,450
thing

633
00:37:08,450 --> 00:37:13,089
is people very well as the market for
privacy in Tokyo and how big is it

634
00:37:13,089 --> 00:37:17,040
and I couldn't find any research on it
because there is no market for privacy

635
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:18,710
so it's sort of like your

636
00:37:18,710 --> 00:37:22,339
Singh was the market for like you know
for unicorn saddles or something

637
00:37:22,339 --> 00:37:27,350
news and market for but it doesn't exist
it's it's good it sounds crazy but

638
00:37:27,350 --> 00:37:32,950
that's the truth and marijuana can open
up the floor

639
00:37:32,950 --> 00:37:36,030
to questions have

640
00:37:36,030 --> 00:37:40,380
from anyone who good

641
00:37:40,380 --> 00:37:43,460
way

642
00:37:43,460 --> 00:37:49,720
well I as a

643
00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:52,820
why ask you about the years of work and
the

644
00:37:52,820 --> 00:37:56,210
decentralize can people

645
00:37:56,210 --> 00:38:00,140
independently set up their own networks
with the stopper is it is piggybacking

646
00:38:00,140 --> 00:38:03,160
through your eyes peer somebody else's
eyes P

647
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:07,359
I'll you can take environment do
whatever you want with it

648
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:11,240
and its probably gonna be GPL so you're
gonna have to give changes back

649
00:38:11,240 --> 00:38:14,830
but other than that there's really no
restrictions on the right to run it in a

650
00:38:14,830 --> 00:38:17,049
facility rebuild even taken

651
00:38:17,050 --> 00:38:20,260
to every of them i think im

652
00:38:20,260 --> 00:38:23,390
yet do you have any idea how many some
scratchers

653
00:38:23,390 --> 00:38:26,740
you'd need for it to be self-sustaining
when she gets launched like

654
00:38:26,740 --> 00:38:30,610
did a hundred people use it a million
people using what point is it

655
00:38:30,610 --> 00:38:34,260
continue to live I would say it's
somewhere between 100 and a million

656
00:38:34,260 --> 00:38:37,940
yeah a problem he

657
00:38:37,940 --> 00:38:40,950
in a break in the middle somewhere I
would guess

658
00:38:40,950 --> 00:38:44,520
or a little less are I would think would
be in the hundreds of thousands

659
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:48,240
is my guess okay and you know it
geographical

660
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:52,060
area would be really be nationwide won't
okay work

661
00:38:52,060 --> 00:38:55,860
this gets into stuff that isn't settled
yet

662
00:38:55,860 --> 00:39:00,570
but there is sort of a potential the on
the table where we could use

663
00:39:00,570 --> 00:39:05,190
a certain wireless network that's in 70
markets in the US

664
00:39:05,190 --> 00:39:10,530
means basically at the top 70 markets
there's a different

665
00:39:10,530 --> 00:39:13,790
a number to the weekend envision it
working I mean there's one way is

666
00:39:13,790 --> 00:39:17,220
bundled with the last mile service like
a Taser someone's wireless network

667
00:39:17,220 --> 00:39:21,730
another intelligence doing kind my like
the mouth AOL has a broadband

668
00:39:21,730 --> 00:39:22,560
subscribers

669
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:25,680
I yeah I I guess I

670
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:29,100
its Maria its yes kinda like pay one
price

671
00:39:29,100 --> 00:39:32,779
get a last mile service bundled with the
VPN and privacy services

672
00:39:32,780 --> 00:39:37,200
I another way can be used there was just
like a traditional VPN provider

673
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:40,800
like you already have your eyes P and
then you just buy this service and been

674
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:42,080
laid on top yourself

675
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:46,100
so in that respect it can be used
worldwide

676
00:39:46,100 --> 00:39:49,900
that make sense all right good luck with
that

677
00:39:49,900 --> 00:39:54,450
thank you I'll get you partly answered
no

678
00:39:54,450 --> 00:39:58,090
my question but I was wondering what
your talks where

679
00:39:58,090 --> 00:40:01,150
on AT&T season under

680
00:40:01,150 --> 00:40:04,150
how well the ma bell monopoly that we
have right now

681
00:40:04,150 --> 00:40:09,370
I and thats basically the model truck
North America right now they can Canada

682
00:40:09,370 --> 00:40:10,810
ever similar problem where

683
00:40:10,810 --> 00:40:14,440
at tacos controlled a long lines and the
last mile

684
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:19,560
and that now we can run begins on top of
that it's

685
00:40:19,560 --> 00:40:22,910
an extra service that requires people to
be aware

686
00:40:22,910 --> 00:40:26,080
the problem and spend money like extra
many

687
00:40:26,080 --> 00:40:29,430
to get an extra service that is
difficult to get

688
00:40:29,430 --> 00:40:33,440
a critical mass of people to choose to
espy's policies in san dimas they have

689
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:34,200
the monopoly

690
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:37,780
um with body parts and how we can

691
00:40:37,780 --> 00:40:41,400
fight back on that monopoly or what
technologies are

692
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:45,980
tools you you think you're using to go
around maybe they're

693
00:40:45,980 --> 00:40:50,690
gonna have been possible problem that
we've established in the last 100 years

694
00:40:50,690 --> 00:40:53,790
was a huge question

695
00:40:53,790 --> 00:40:57,270
I on I don't have an answer in

696
00:40:57,270 --> 00:41:00,550
yeah I don't know that I have the answer
me that there are a lot of really

697
00:41:00,550 --> 00:41:02,900
interesting group that are working on
problems like that

698
00:41:02,900 --> 00:41:06,370
a you know access now

699
00:41:06,370 --> 00:41:09,640
groups like that iron

700
00:41:09,640 --> 00:41:13,870
yep Air Force on that problem a lot it's
not one that I'm

701
00:41:13,870 --> 00:41:16,920
prepare to take on myself at this point

702
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:21,820
I'm just tryna stay laser focused on
trying to change the way

703
00:41:21,820 --> 00:41:23,090
telecommunications

704
00:41:23,090 --> 00:41:27,600
use privacy so I'm sorry to have a
better answer

705
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:32,710
latter how do you plan on dealing with
lost keys

706
00:41:32,710 --> 00:41:36,120
is like if you don't have the keys you
can't yes ended

707
00:41:36,120 --> 00:41:39,960
password reset email and somebody it was
there on that's very true

708
00:41:39,960 --> 00:41:43,750
the the way a were gonna deal with it is
that

709
00:41:43,750 --> 00:41:47,590
the you're out of luck if you lose your
email is gone

710
00:41:47,590 --> 00:41:50,640
make I imagine getting that customer
support phone call

711
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:53,650
and being on the line with an irate
prison for like

712
00:41:53,650 --> 00:41:57,120
buy dollars Lake that doesn't sound like
a solution

713
00:41:57,120 --> 00:42:01,990
no I think it's going to be very
important to set expectations

714
00:42:01,990 --> 00:42:05,070
at the beginning from the very beginning

715
00:42:05,070 --> 00:42:08,290
to let people know that if they lose
their keys that they're fucked

716
00:42:08,290 --> 00:42:15,290
is a when he was more than just no way
around it because I didn't intend for

717
00:42:17,430 --> 00:42:20,730
this to be used by journalists to go
down from the countries we intend for it

718
00:42:20,730 --> 00:42:24,290
to be used by human rights researchers
young 10 for to be used by people whose

719
00:42:24,290 --> 00:42:25,640
lives are in danger

720
00:42:25,640 --> 00:42:29,529
we obviously can't really have a key
escrow system around somewhere that

721
00:42:29,530 --> 00:42:30,380
undercuts it

722
00:42:30,380 --> 00:42:33,680
yeah because it would be put people's
lives in danger so

723
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:37,330
were biometrics Lake is Voice print
authentication

724
00:42:37,330 --> 00:42:41,770
to the point where you think about using
their Matt but I i kno

725
00:42:41,770 --> 00:42:45,980
I mean in maybe a theoretically possible
like maybe going to be a pretty much man

726
00:42:45,980 --> 00:42:47,660
I T they're working on it but

727
00:42:47,660 --> 00:42:50,730
at this point not that I know of and
where

728
00:42:50,730 --> 00:42:54,690
bumping was really important to me from
a design perspective on this thing is

729
00:42:54,690 --> 00:42:55,790
not disorder

730
00:42:55,790 --> 00:42:59,190
going to i'm sorry territory not try to
reinvent the wheel in Regina

731
00:42:59,190 --> 00:43:02,570
does work with existing battle-hardened

732
00:43:02,570 --> 00:43:06,840
tested software that's been around in
and been knocked around a lot

733
00:43:06,840 --> 00:43:11,530
so I'm I'd be worried about sorter
moving into like the cutting cutting

734
00:43:11,530 --> 00:43:12,190
edge

735
00:43:12,190 --> 00:43:16,450
you know that's where we're trying to go
just basic public key

736
00:43:16,450 --> 00:43:23,450
thanks them

737
00:43:24,140 --> 00:43:27,710
got very a technicals this might be a
stupid question but a

738
00:43:27,710 --> 00:43:33,030
did this prevent are I dunno yourself in
my pings towers and then based on that

739
00:43:33,030 --> 00:43:34,210
they can trying it's a %uh

740
00:43:34,210 --> 00:43:37,780
use here with this prevent night in the
new year

741
00:43:37,780 --> 00:43:41,870
not exactly known this is one of the
problems

742
00:43:41,870 --> 00:43:45,569
in terms have not been able to control
the whole network if you pay me back in

743
00:43:45,570 --> 00:43:46,700
other people's networks

744
00:43:46,700 --> 00:43:50,150
that means that you the some parts of it
opened to

745
00:43:50,150 --> 00:43:54,500
being listened to you and one of the big
things that law enforcement's been doing

746
00:43:54,500 --> 00:43:57,440
reason you may have seen this in paper
you may not have but it's worth looking

747
00:43:57,440 --> 00:43:58,150
into

748
00:43:58,150 --> 00:44:03,660
is they request from Tokyo something
called a tower down

749
00:44:03,660 --> 00:44:07,259
and I told everyone is connected to the
tower a certain period of time they may

750
00:44:07,260 --> 00:44:08,970
be looking for some guy that robbed a
bank

751
00:44:08,970 --> 00:44:11,850
but I end up with a list like a hundred
thousand people are connected to that

752
00:44:11,850 --> 00:44:12,529
our

753
00:44:12,530 --> 00:44:17,580
maybe you me and everyone in this room
so

754
00:44:17,580 --> 00:44:20,960
the the short answer is No it doesn't
prevent a

755
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:23,770
because we don't control the towers if
we don't then maybe we could do

756
00:44:23,770 --> 00:44:24,660
something about it

757
00:44:24,660 --> 00:44:28,580
the game more in-depth you know I read
about some interesting stuff like I read

758
00:44:28,580 --> 00:44:29,840
about in

759
00:44:29,840 --> 00:44:33,790
in Pakistan this is a story about a long
time ago and some may have been like

760
00:44:33,790 --> 00:44:35,040
knocking around in my head

761
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:39,430
the word burmese really cheap cell
phones across a dollar

762
00:44:39,430 --> 00:44:42,850
is Chinese cell phones and the
manufacture

763
00:44:42,850 --> 00:44:48,910
to cut corners and save money I coated
the IMEI number in each phone

764
00:44:48,910 --> 00:44:52,980
has been all zeros miss him a penny and
his phone or something and they were

765
00:44:52,980 --> 00:44:53,630
like ass

766
00:44:53,630 --> 00:44:57,540
you know and that there was at 99 cents
on the dollar and I

767
00:44:57,540 --> 00:45:01,529
but the problem they're having was that
all the phones rawls heroes and they can

768
00:45:01,530 --> 00:45:02,520
really tell them apart

769
00:45:02,520 --> 00:45:06,230
and so when the questions I'm interested
in exploring firmer

770
00:45:06,230 --> 00:45:09,270
research development pointed you exactly

771
00:45:09,270 --> 00:45:12,570
work party the GSM spectrum

772
00:45:12,570 --> 00:45:16,630
you know it is is mandated under the law
and like how much we're governments

773
00:45:16,630 --> 00:45:17,830
there and what can we do

774
00:45:17,830 --> 00:45:20,759
to sort of work around the fact that we
have to deal with other peoples towers

775
00:45:20,760 --> 00:45:22,150
that other people have access to

776
00:45:22,150 --> 00:45:25,910
so I don't have like a final

777
00:45:25,910 --> 00:45:29,799
big dancer like yes we're gonna do
without this way but

778
00:45:29,800 --> 00:45:33,530
I can say that you know people on
adviser border really into that

779
00:45:33,530 --> 00:45:36,740
stuff and people who are on the advisory
board but that I talk to a lot about

780
00:45:36,740 --> 00:45:38,090
these ideas are like

781
00:45:38,090 --> 00:45:42,910
majors hidden cam going into on these
issues and figure out what can be done

782
00:45:42,910 --> 00:45:44,230
and what can be done

783
00:45:44,230 --> 00:45:47,350
and something that we're absolutely
concerned about

784
00:45:47,350 --> 00:45:51,819
you know the technology behind this like
the GPS stuff in France

785
00:45:51,820 --> 00:45:55,960
fran has now I'm online has been spazz
been abuse

786
00:45:55,960 --> 00:45:59,090
like massive im on the other hand

787
00:45:59,090 --> 00:46:02,220
if you're some housecleaning and you get
an avalanche

788
00:46:02,220 --> 00:46:05,510
there was kinda column so it's like a

789
00:46:05,510 --> 00:46:09,560
I can see that it's bad technology its
its agnostic technology

790
00:46:09,560 --> 00:46:13,410
it can be really awesome when you get
provider

791
00:46:13,410 --> 00:46:16,859
there's no recommends a sec if you're
being tracked everywhere

792
00:46:16,860 --> 00:46:20,340
so it's like something that I'm is an
open question that we're looking to

793
00:46:20,340 --> 00:46:20,980
address

794
00:46:20,980 --> 00:46:24,360
has recommended thank you thank you

795
00:46:24,360 --> 00:46:27,650
I think am

796
00:46:27,650 --> 00:46:31,270
as well your advisers not here to answer
ask a question but

797
00:46:31,270 --> 00:46:35,730
just sorted expressed i love u the need
for folks like Nick tips or to be in the

798
00:46:35,730 --> 00:46:36,610
vanguard

799
00:46:36,610 --> 00:46:41,860
trying to bring this work to the masses
and commercialize it and make it fair

800
00:46:41,860 --> 00:46:42,890
and just

801
00:46:42,890 --> 00:46:46,540
and usable and that the way that you
know all of us

802
00:46:46,540 --> 00:46:50,080
as advisers see is these the these are
competitive efforts

803
00:46:50,080 --> 00:46:54,779
am as long as you're open and exchanging
ideas you know we all want to use

804
00:46:54,780 --> 00:46:58,250
like which will builders we want people
to use in a player tools to

805
00:46:58,250 --> 00:47:01,940
humans and to fight the robots that have
been talking about

806
00:47:01,940 --> 00:47:05,060
so I'm anything in ed

807
00:47:05,060 --> 00:47:08,180
Nick needs our support and and said to
pitch

808
00:47:08,180 --> 00:47:11,640
a talk at five related to this is the
opens kids left the network

809
00:47:11,640 --> 00:47:15,580
this is there's lots of names and titles
in projects but everything we're doing

810
00:47:15,580 --> 00:47:16,520
is totally

811
00:47:16,520 --> 00:47:19,950
feeding into this so the more if you
want to start writing code now and

812
00:47:19,950 --> 00:47:21,360
playing with some these ideas

813
00:47:21,360 --> 00:47:25,620
you can run stuff like West TN you can
use Moxie's tech security at

814
00:47:25,620 --> 00:47:28,880
you know and he's not committing co 2
anymore you might you know things like

815
00:47:28,880 --> 00:47:29,520
this so

816
00:47:29,520 --> 00:47:32,890
there's a lot you can do today to start
acting on this such that when Nick gets

817
00:47:32,890 --> 00:47:35,160
is piles money than ya be ready to

818
00:47:35,160 --> 00:47:41,480
help him build his dreams thanks way

819
00:47:41,480 --> 00:47:44,990
when a fatass the Guardian project

820
00:47:44,990 --> 00:47:48,670
I any other questions

821
00:47:48,670 --> 00:47:51,740
him

822
00:47:51,740 --> 00:47:55,369
I I mean

823
00:47:55,369 --> 00:47:59,320
in terms have been terms a interns are
doing Voice over IP s

824
00:47:59,320 --> 00:48:03,140
a it's probably a slightly different

825
00:48:03,140 --> 00:48:10,140
modeling but but on some level yes do
you for C

826
00:48:10,850 --> 00:48:15,200
any potential for loss to change for
telephone providers to make we trained

827
00:48:15,200 --> 00:48:15,640
you

828
00:48:15,640 --> 00:48:20,170
legal became widespread exporting that
wasn't phones for example

829
00:48:20,170 --> 00:48:24,780
I there was absolutely potential for the
loss to change

830
00:48:24,780 --> 00:48:28,030
proposals are being put forth all the
time time

831
00:48:28,030 --> 00:48:31,500
I mean right now there's a lot of stuff
going on in Great Britain and Australia

832
00:48:31,500 --> 00:48:33,010
and Canada thats

833
00:48:33,010 --> 00:48:36,460
horrifying there's also bad

834
00:48:36,460 --> 00:48:40,520
in my opinion proposals being put forth
in this country all the time

835
00:48:40,520 --> 00:48:44,040
I in fact they're talking about
modifying

836
00:48:44,040 --> 00:48:46,930
the Korea law that I mentioned earlier
in one other words that I have is that

837
00:48:46,930 --> 00:48:48,649
they might take out that exception

838
00:48:48,650 --> 00:48:51,800
and that allows you to use encryption as
long as you don't have the keys

839
00:48:51,800 --> 00:48:55,770
so yes it's it's a constant danger

840
00:48:55,770 --> 00:48:59,960
the one thing that I think

841
00:48:59,960 --> 00:49:04,040
is a good thing is that there are other
companies right now using this business

842
00:49:04,040 --> 00:49:04,570
model

843
00:49:04,570 --> 00:49:08,600
someone BlackBerry is the best example
most well-known example

844
00:49:08,600 --> 00:49:13,250
it's only in your enterprise model an
enterprise model for blackberry to give

845
00:49:13,250 --> 00:49:15,000
you a server which is hosted in your

846
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:18,670
data center your office and that server
holds all the keys

847
00:49:18,670 --> 00:49:23,609
for other devices in your organization I
think that's how they got around this

848
00:49:23,609 --> 00:49:26,619
requirement in Korea and this is also
why

849
00:49:26,619 --> 00:49:30,150
blackberry ran into such trouble in
India and

850
00:49:30,150 --> 00:49:33,369
a few other countries you know where
their

851
00:49:33,369 --> 00:49:37,170
were being requested backdoor access and
everything in there

852
00:49:37,170 --> 00:49:42,980
said we can give it to you so if you
read only me doing this and that would

853
00:49:42,980 --> 00:49:44,220
be I would feel like

854
00:49:44,220 --> 00:49:47,619
super expose the fact that the it's not
just mean that there's other people

855
00:49:47,619 --> 00:49:48,260
doing it

856
00:49:48,260 --> 00:49:52,330
makes me feel like at least it's not
huge numbers but there's safety in

857
00:49:52,330 --> 00:49:57,720
some members I'm and I think an argument
to be made that it's bad for innovation

858
00:49:57,720 --> 00:49:58,880
is bad for business

859
00:49:58,880 --> 00:50:02,670
to bankrupt our country car

860
00:50:02,670 --> 00:50:06,240
one of the things I've been trying to do
this would have preempt these arguments

861
00:50:06,240 --> 00:50:10,380
that the cricoid griffey's batter that
it's bad for national security is to try

862
00:50:10,380 --> 00:50:10,710
to

863
00:50:10,710 --> 00:50:13,840
linked together the concept love

864
00:50:13,840 --> 00:50:18,600
privacy in cybersecurity to try to say
that cybersecurity and privacy to a

865
00:50:18,600 --> 00:50:20,330
large degree are the same

866
00:50:20,330 --> 00:50:24,170
problem being described a different
framing and to the extent that you can

867
00:50:24,170 --> 00:50:24,880
introduce

868
00:50:24,880 --> 00:50:29,200
strong predictor at a low level into the
telecommunications system you can

869
00:50:29,200 --> 00:50:29,790
address

870
00:50:29,790 --> 00:50:32,980
both problems this is sort of like a

871
00:50:32,980 --> 00:50:37,470
the tactic to bring to having groups
that don't think that there

872
00:50:37,470 --> 00:50:40,590
that they have similar interests under
the same time make them realize that

873
00:50:40,590 --> 00:50:41,510
both their

874
00:50:41,510 --> 00:50:44,900
problems can be addressed the one
approach

875
00:50:44,900 --> 00:50:48,690
so that's you know one of the things I'm
trying to do disorders

876
00:50:48,690 --> 00:50:53,340
I'm preempt people that would

877
00:50:53,340 --> 00:50:57,850
try to ban privacy focus scripter

878
00:50:57,850 --> 00:51:02,040
on that would be bad for national
security about her privacy bad for all

879
00:51:02,040 --> 00:51:05,150
the defense contractors are trying to
protect their intellectual property from

880
00:51:05,150 --> 00:51:05,970
being stolen by

881
00:51:05,970 --> 00:51:10,619
you know chinese hackers or whatever is
that dreaded the day I'm

882
00:51:10,619 --> 00:51:14,700
as part of why I'm trying to work with
people like that and as a tech director

883
00:51:14,700 --> 00:51:18,290
former Republican congressman and former
you know

884
00:51:18,290 --> 00:51:22,380
US Attorney Bob are people like that
these are the establishment people

885
00:51:22,380 --> 00:51:26,619
but they have law enforcement
intelligence credentials that sweater

886
00:51:26,619 --> 00:51:31,090
give them Gravatar to me speak out about
how dragnet surveillance is

887
00:51:31,090 --> 00:51:34,700
un-american anti-democratic bad for
business and

888
00:51:34,700 --> 00:51:37,880
also bad for intellectual property

889
00:51:37,880 --> 00:51:41,040
protection for them industry

890
00:51:41,040 --> 00:51:44,450
hope that kinda addresses across from
Nigeria to

891
00:51:44,450 --> 00:51:49,050
thanks Chur hi

892
00:51:49,050 --> 00:51:53,000
you're talking about using MVNO model
soul

893
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:56,030
not only would your clients or customers

894
00:51:56,030 --> 00:52:00,330
you know unavoidably give up their
location

895
00:52:00,330 --> 00:52:05,490
to whoever the income earners but
they're also using shared infrastructure

896
00:52:05,490 --> 00:52:09,960
at least from the towers were one hot
bath im

897
00:52:09,960 --> 00:52:13,940
how do you how do you protect against
interception

898
00:52:13,940 --> 00:52:17,540
between the tower and your hoor

899
00:52:17,540 --> 00:52:21,020
et cetera I just want to say that we
just have two minutes seen a sign we

900
00:52:21,020 --> 00:52:21,990
have two minutes ago

901
00:52:21,990 --> 00:52:25,910
I'm para what I'm looking at is not
using the voice channel

902
00:52:25,910 --> 00:52:29,140
on using the data channel and including
everything

903
00:52:29,140 --> 00:52:33,480
and routing everything back through
never controlled by my organization

904
00:52:33,480 --> 00:52:36,700
so that we're not having the incumbent
route the calls

905
00:52:36,700 --> 00:52:39,660
they won't see the to and from on any
phone call don't see the to and from

906
00:52:39,660 --> 00:52:41,160
many SMS

907
00:52:41,160 --> 00:52:45,470
I can address that GOP visioning thing
earlier

908
00:52:45,470 --> 00:52:49,680
is not have a lot you can do about that
but I'm curious as to what is

909
00:52:49,680 --> 00:52:52,920
the exact as I mention Chris's tonight
what are the primers and what you're

910
00:52:52,920 --> 00:52:55,140
allowed to do more we're not allowed to
do

911
00:52:55,140 --> 00:52:58,490
and a different one for all

912
00:52:58,490 --> 00:53:01,720
