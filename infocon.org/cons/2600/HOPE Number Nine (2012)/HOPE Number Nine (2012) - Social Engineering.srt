1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:02,849
introduced an event close to my heart
and some people close to my heart as

2
00:00:02,850 --> 00:00:03,439
well

3
00:00:03,439 --> 00:00:06,920
and if that isn't social engineering I
don't know what is ladies and gentlemen

4
00:00:06,920 --> 00:00:08,480
I'm I'd like to introduce may

5
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:13,460
my friend Emanuel theme and a company
and this is the social engineering panel

6
00:00:13,460 --> 00:00:20,460
at their fire the

7
00:00:31,239 --> 00:00:34,590
I just gotta say you have no idea how
stressful it is to

8
00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:38,670
try prepare for their something confer
clever things to do on the telephone

9
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:42,760
opt for two years I've been dreading
this moment and the conference is easy

10
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:44,479
its that's the phone calls it a
difficult

11
00:00:44,479 --> 00:00:48,540
I and we're going to tell some stories
and take questions and things like that

12
00:00:48,540 --> 00:00:51,870
arm it's all about stories really is all
about

13
00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:56,379
I adventures in figuring things out and
trying new tactics and stuff like that

14
00:00:56,379 --> 00:00:59,509
and it's not like to encourage people
out there cuz I know you all have ideas

15
00:00:59,509 --> 00:01:00,890
and stories like that too

16
00:01:00,890 --> 00:01:04,430
write some articles for us we want to
hear new voices we have a lot to call

17
00:01:04,430 --> 00:01:05,080
articles but

18
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:09,729
I know there are people out there are
that are doing really interesting stuff

19
00:01:09,729 --> 00:01:10,798
with technology

20
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:13,909
and 2600 exists for that so

21
00:01:13,909 --> 00:01:17,630
if you think you're writing article
first please do so I'll Senate article

22
00:01:17,630 --> 00:01:21,960
226 on the dot com I hope we get like a
thousand articles tonight arm because

23
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:24,659
I've heard so many cals stories is
walking through the hallways and I I

24
00:01:24,659 --> 00:01:26,350
would love to see those in print

25
00:01:26,350 --> 00:01:30,310
and that's kinda how this community gets
built is just by sharing stories

26
00:01:30,310 --> 00:01:34,780
are okay like introduce everybody arm
but see all the way down there on the on

27
00:01:34,780 --> 00:01:35,150
the

28
00:01:35,150 --> 00:01:40,450
a on my left to right: Islam on on on up
by the curtain hi I don't are now lower

29
00:01:40,450 --> 00:01:47,450
bernie s I am on

30
00:01:47,710 --> 00:01:52,430
%ah next to him

31
00:01:52,430 --> 00:01:56,080
I as a someone who's up in on the scene
of a little less time I guess our

32
00:01:56,080 --> 00:02:03,080
not getting on and next to me

33
00:02:04,970 --> 00:02:11,970
from Austria our friend Johannes on good
neigh

34
00:02:15,069 --> 00:02:20,050
now i'd like I might ask God to view 20
tell something about maybe

35
00:02:20,050 --> 00:02:24,959
what you think social engineering here's
I'll what people here might wanna

36
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:28,600
learn about it maybe some some stories
that the

37
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:31,739
that you my love from encountered along

38
00:02:31,739 --> 00:02:37,470
along the way so with you bernie thank
you give me some fair warning I'm

39
00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:42,790
hmm I'll well what I think social
engineering is is getting people to do

40
00:02:42,790 --> 00:02:43,980
something it to

41
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:47,149
the probably wouldn't ever do if

42
00:02:47,150 --> 00:02:50,959
they knew it was me asking them to do
British hmm

43
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:54,700
or someone like me on and a

44
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:58,390
I find it a bigger challenge getting
able a more interesting and rewarding

45
00:02:58,390 --> 00:03:00,130
challenge in getting to do things

46
00:03:00,130 --> 00:03:06,540
without lying to them by the same thing
is certain: turn a voice in certain way

47
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:09,700
%ah to make them think they're to

48
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:13,650
this is in the best interest to tell you
how to do something

49
00:03:13,650 --> 00:03:17,890
war to give you information yet really
shouldn't be giving out

50
00:03:17,890 --> 00:03:21,560
on your YouTube is easy to Caroline and
get that but it's a

51
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:25,260
it was challenging to say in a way that
bid if you

52
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:29,899
read between lines are just Lou Reed go
back and look at what you said

53
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:33,320
you didn't say anything was exactly
untrue so that's I think I've

54
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:37,269
more interesting challenge aspect to it
but with all the definitions first

55
00:03:37,269 --> 00:03:38,820
animated stories after that

56
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:43,100
sure so how did the talk on to the
social engineering for me is absolute

57
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:44,579
fascination have had since I was a

58
00:03:44,579 --> 00:03:49,109
me little lad its the the intersection
of sociology psychology for me is this

59
00:03:49,109 --> 00:03:53,209
interpretation a pure culture
surrounding and how to exploit that on a

60
00:03:53,209 --> 00:03:56,500
waves using your words are prone to
these are saying tone of voice

61
00:03:56,500 --> 00:04:01,070
things like that it's just controlling
someone's a thoughts and how they react

62
00:04:01,070 --> 00:04:03,730
to you based on how you present yourself
to them

63
00:04:03,730 --> 00:04:06,669
I love giving the example above wearing
a suit because it needs to get his

64
00:04:06,669 --> 00:04:07,660
appearance that

65
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:10,750
you may be someone important I don't
know why I'll a great miss you

66
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:11,299
apparently

67
00:04:11,299 --> 00:04:13,980
because people love to give me
information they shouldn't give me it

68
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:15,000
anytime

69
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:19,290
so there's the social engineering for me
is this is wonderful way of color love

70
00:04:19,290 --> 00:04:21,130
playing with the human psyche

71
00:04:21,130 --> 00:04:25,190
in a way that mild sometimes it has a
very negative spin because you can use

72
00:04:25,190 --> 00:04:25,510
it

73
00:04:25,510 --> 00:04:29,380
for analyst at the Venice but as various
things lot more fun to do with outline

74
00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:33,090
because by doing that it's not only a
challenge yourself but it's more than

75
00:04:33,090 --> 00:04:34,500
mental tasks to

76
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:37,610
wrap your head around well what are they
thinking

77
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:41,560
how do they do that okay at home

78
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:47,540
yeah nice yeah %uh I like to conserve
the social engineering

79
00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:52,040
but I never liked the term because
engineering is an exact science

80
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:55,680
and what we're doing when we doing
social engineering is never engineering

81
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:56,520
so thick that day

82
00:04:56,520 --> 00:05:01,150
it cannot be planned there's a certain
way he psychology there's certain

83
00:05:01,150 --> 00:05:04,600
ways to statistically analyze how people
behave but

84
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:08,770
that's never fun a I E like here

85
00:05:08,770 --> 00:05:12,289
I like to call it a dance and sometimes
I'm them

86
00:05:12,290 --> 00:05:15,360
the like the leading figure and
sometimes

87
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:19,229
I'm being let's and tried to clear on
that

88
00:05:19,229 --> 00:05:24,000
I think we we done we like social
engineering

89
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,820
company is the term because I can't
think anything else right now arm

90
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:32,849
I we we like doing things over the phone
because we can hide their identities we

91
00:05:32,850 --> 00:05:34,540
can just use voices

92
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:38,840
and people don't see what you look like
so that's that's one line defense you're

93
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:39,580
able to

94
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:43,430
to pretend you're somebody you not be
obviously you have to do this on

95
00:05:43,430 --> 00:05:46,759
computers as well where you just text on
a screen and you

96
00:05:46,759 --> 00:05:49,900
can make people believe youre anybody on
IRC thats

97
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:53,810
it's not that difficult I whatnot kevin
was talking about was actually showing

98
00:05:53,810 --> 00:05:58,040
up in person in a suit and getting
people to believe that you're legitimate

99
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:01,919
there as well on we find people are very
trusting

100
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:05,568
accompanies a very trusting to
especially the big companies at

101
00:06:05,569 --> 00:06:09,419
I kinda faceless and have a massive
amount of people working for them

102
00:06:09,419 --> 00:06:09,889
because

103
00:06:09,889 --> 00:06:13,550
you just basically saying well this
person said to call you

104
00:06:13,550 --> 00:06:16,669
and I'm just doing my job and they're
just doing their job so

105
00:06:16,669 --> 00:06:20,159
the machine just sort of keep Sam
plodding along and if you're able to

106
00:06:20,159 --> 00:06:21,550
manipulated

107
00:06:21,550 --> 00:06:26,219
in the right way there's all kinds of
information that you can get outta that

108
00:06:26,219 --> 00:06:30,219
arm we we we have the most like I think
guys and playing with massive

109
00:06:30,219 --> 00:06:32,050
bureaucracies and just getting them to

110
00:06:32,050 --> 00:06:35,449
do our bidding without realizing that's
what's going on arm

111
00:06:35,449 --> 00:06:39,210
so I don't know what you guys have any
arm specific stories are things that

112
00:06:39,210 --> 00:06:42,159
have happened in the past we are gonna
try some some experiments

113
00:06:42,159 --> 00:06:46,938
and as with any social engineering
experiment is no guarantee its gonna

114
00:06:46,939 --> 00:06:47,960
work could be

115
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:51,460
complete disaster we find that
individual people when you call

116
00:06:51,460 --> 00:06:54,360
individual people ask them for
information they're a lot more wary

117
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:58,030
they're a lot more sharp then if you
call somebody who's working

118
00:06:58,030 --> 00:07:01,860
and say at a fast food place or even a

119
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:05,249
a government offices something like that
they're more likely to just

120
00:07:05,249 --> 00:07:08,770
obey whatever you tell them but people
they're looking out for themselves and

121
00:07:08,770 --> 00:07:11,090
that's a good thing I like to think that
something that

122
00:07:11,090 --> 00:07:14,400
Packers are able to sort of help instill
that

123
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:18,889
you gotta protect your privacy and not
just do it somebody tells you

124
00:07:18,889 --> 00:07:23,360
at NAB running any any memories over
anything in the past maybe that

125
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:26,919
people told you that they really
shouldn't have

126
00:07:26,919 --> 00:07:31,889
I A I'm seats on this is a different
sample social engineering

127
00:07:31,889 --> 00:07:36,080
arm maybe something something that was a
situation I got people tell me something

128
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:37,090
but I got some

129
00:07:37,090 --> 00:07:41,409
a group of people to do something that
another group of people

130
00:07:41,409 --> 00:07:46,430
really wanted me to do on it was a it
goes way back to

131
00:07:46,430 --> 00:07:50,669
1995 when I was incarcerated in federal
prison

132
00:07:50,669 --> 00:07:53,938
on and the way they did

133
00:07:53,939 --> 00:07:56,960
the way the cell block was laid out is a

134
00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:00,729
her to tears and you stuck here by and
hear

135
00:08:00,729 --> 00:08:03,900
and there were three TD rooms on

136
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:07,680
and as it works out they were pretty
much used by

137
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:10,960
certain on una

138
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:14,460
on a race basis there is a like a like
rise in one

139
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:17,749
%ah black guys in another and Latinos
and in the third one

140
00:08:17,749 --> 00:08:21,889
hispanics and never know tonight in the
door saying blacks only or anything I

141
00:08:21,889 --> 00:08:23,039
just sit just

142
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:28,128
thats I was set up so that's just the
way it was and

143
00:08:28,129 --> 00:08:32,240
there is a group up individuals there
who were incarcerated

144
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:36,130
are for are some organized crime
activities

145
00:08:36,130 --> 00:08:41,059
and there is about I guess that twenty
or so of them in this particular group

146
00:08:41,060 --> 00:08:44,690
and he got to know me I got to know them
and

147
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:47,810
baby one night I

148
00:08:47,810 --> 00:08:52,620
they knew in advance data the godfather
which can be playing on television in a

149
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:55,670
really wanted to see and it wasn't
enough room in there won t be room for

150
00:08:55,670 --> 00:08:57,400
all up in the comm

151
00:08:57,400 --> 00:09:00,569
any needed some way to get people out I

169
00:09:57,480 --> 00:10:00,740
D one-s_ on a

170

178
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:32,420
prisons purple program statement is like
an encyclopedia

179
00:10:32,420 --> 00:10:36,810
regulations are in a new policy on that
a new conjugal visit policy

180
00:10:36,810 --> 00:10:40,360
there is no such thing as a conjugal
visit policy

181
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:44,610
in in in problem hardly any present US
the land for prisons

182
00:10:44,610 --> 00:10:48,630
so I wrote up this the whole thing in
your prisons speak

183
00:10:48,630 --> 00:10:53,630
are that the the the newer conjugal
visit policy in the deadline

184
00:10:53,630 --> 00:10:57,430
with that night they had to get the
applications in and had a beer is a very

185
00:10:57,430 --> 00:10:58,790
complex

186
00:10:58,790 --> 00:11:03,060
series have things that had to be worded
on this application

187
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:05,980
I you to fill out a form that was
readily available for any kind request

188
00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:07,230
yet again so

189
00:11:07,230 --> 00:11:10,250
on in with his word in such a way that

190
00:11:10,250 --> 00:11:13,300
that certain people getting Sharpie
wouldn't get it like to be like subtle

191
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:14,090
things like

192
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:17,410
these requests we handled on a
first-come first-served basis

193
00:11:17,410 --> 00:11:21,819
and dad stuff like that in end itself
urges beyond

194
00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:25,570
I blah beyond belief like there's
bending machines in a

195
00:11:25,570 --> 00:11:28,730
in the visitor's room that I would have
certain

196
00:11:28,730 --> 00:11:33,090
certain a certain sections ever place
with condoms and the to

197
00:11:33,090 --> 00:11:39,290
I there will be at no audio monitoring
in the rooms narrowly the visits brawl

198
00:11:39,290 --> 00:11:42,480
you know supervised by prison guards but
to

199
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:46,370
there be no idea monitoring in the
occasional visit room and identity

200
00:11:46,370 --> 00:11:50,820
the on see a CV

201
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:54,830
art CTR yeah we got the only acronyms
the CVR the Beano

202
00:11:54,830 --> 00:11:57,950
no audio monitoring but visual
monitoring well

203
00:11:57,950 --> 00:12:01,110
might be through the window might be a
might use an ETA

204
00:12:01,110 --> 00:12:04,890
marital age would be made available as
necessary

205
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:08,560
so any I put all this thing was couple
paragraphs and we knew that he had to

206
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:09,640
fill this thing out

207
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:12,980
that night yet happening had be filled
in at nine get it and step into the

208
00:12:12,980 --> 00:12:14,280
warden's door

209
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:17,520
on by morning

210
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:21,740
Anna so sure enough and I cluded

211
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:24,940
mobsters into this so they wouldn't
never be done but they all make sure

212
00:12:24,940 --> 00:12:25,620
that they'd

213
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:29,000
they didn't feel insulted by the SQ they
asked me to do this so even as he did a

214
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,700
particular thing but it was a method

215
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:35,140
and it turns out that %uh the TV room
was emptied at night they're often out

216
00:12:35,140 --> 00:12:36,660
this application

217
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:40,030
and I i talked with the next day I talk
to the guy who our

218
00:12:40,030 --> 00:12:43,270
who mops the floor in in the warden's
office

219
00:12:43,270 --> 00:12:47,240
and a he was there when the warden
Canyon the next day and had that big

220
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:48,540
stack

221
00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:52,110
a BAP occasions any wondering with their
hockey

222
00:12:52,110 --> 00:12:56,130
is this so any homework you got
everybody out at the other TV room they

223
00:12:56,130 --> 00:12:59,480
watch the godfather which was that the
movie the love they live for

224
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:03,710
the sea is like wannabe mobsters but the
like a game couldn't shoot straight but

225
00:13:03,710 --> 00:13:08,210
anyhow did at night the that Monday I
was moved out to another place

226
00:13:08,210 --> 00:13:11,220
and they're nowhere percussions me I
don't think you're pretty big nose

227
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:15,330
anything about that until now but that
was that was like a

228
00:13:15,330 --> 00:13:18,840
you now back in the 90's so that was
social engineering and I didn't

229
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:22,790
you know it was just a written memo it
wasn't a was me calling anybody nothing

230
00:13:22,790 --> 00:13:24,260
to get him to give me information

231
00:13:24,260 --> 00:13:27,630
and you know I feel kinda bad about it
but arm

232
00:13:27,630 --> 00:13:31,640
you know if if wait why do you feel bad
about it well because they probably were

233
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:33,530
getting all excited in

234
00:13:33,530 --> 00:13:38,490
Talon their wives and girlfriends a bad
in had a disappointment

235
00:13:38,490 --> 00:13:42,160
but you know if they really if they
really read it carefully they were to

236
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:44,490
realize it couldn't possibly be true

237
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:48,150
so it was just wishful thinking I think
on their part so that was

238
00:13:48,150 --> 00:13:55,150
as one story came to mind

239
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:58,460
before I have that memory want to see it
all

240
00:13:58,460 --> 00:14:05,320
email me and I'll us any cabinet hell
yeah classy you basically social

241
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:06,400
engineer by paper

242
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:09,470
yeah you can do that you can social
engineer

243
00:14:09,470 --> 00:14:13,020
corporations do with us all the time has
a and governments to toss

244
00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:17,650
all the time and the social engineer us
I just by issuing official-looking memos

245
00:14:17,650 --> 00:14:18,130
in

246
00:14:18,130 --> 00:14:22,720
corporate policies in I wanna hurt
speakers was almost social engineered

247
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:23,790
not giving a talk

248
00:14:23,790 --> 00:14:29,060
by a sending a memo there you know we
know about this evidence it was it was

249
00:14:29,060 --> 00:14:32,660
it was a crisis think you can get the a
and factor in a very good point

250
00:14:32,660 --> 00:14:36,569
a lot a legal threats it's a it's
another for social engineering and

251
00:14:36,570 --> 00:14:38,050
trying to get you to do

252
00:14:38,050 --> 00:14:42,590
what they're threatening you to do say
that you have to take this page down are

253
00:14:42,590 --> 00:14:43,810
we going to our

254
00:14:43,810 --> 00:14:47,650
I come after you of course they have no
intention ever doing that because would

255
00:14:47,650 --> 00:14:48,020
be

256
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:51,520
way too expensive and time-consuming
they probably lose but most cases people

257
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:53,630
get a threatening letter of some sort

258
00:14:53,630 --> 00:14:57,040
and they obey it because they're afraid
and they don't want to

259
00:14:57,040 --> 00:15:01,650
incur any Ron expanse a risk writing
like that so yeah

260
00:15:01,650 --> 00:15:05,890
appointed as always we're doing this arm
I would like to I actually before we get

261
00:15:05,890 --> 00:15:06,460
Kevin

262
00:15:06,460 --> 00:15:11,220
on I reach out to our a local place the
reason I wanna do it now is because an

263
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:15,430
I'll we we spend a little time before
this panel just getting

264
00:15:15,430 --> 00:15:18,840
business hours and things like that
sorted out so that we would call place

265
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:20,000
before they closed

266
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,920
and spice 'cause 10 actually the guy
said 945 I think you want to get out

267
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:24,440
there early

268
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:28,270
eyes a local Subway I'm sure you're
familiar with the

269
00:15:28,270 --> 00:15:33,270
the supply chain I'm and arm this
would've reminds me of something that a

270
00:15:33,270 --> 00:15:34,380
friend minded

271
00:15:34,380 --> 00:15:39,390
I years ago I where this involved the
phone company and boy that that really

272
00:15:39,390 --> 00:15:40,270
took some guts

273
00:15:40,270 --> 00:15:43,829
are hiya I'm he basically called the
phone company

274
00:15:43,830 --> 00:15:47,530
I think was down on Pearl Street here in
manhattan and said that

275
00:15:47,530 --> 00:15:50,640
he was showing up I to collect the

276
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:54,520
the old identification cards and that
the new ones will be delivered shortly

277
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:55,510
afterwards

278
00:15:55,510 --> 00:15:58,819
as a 15-year-old Katie I

279
00:15:58,820 --> 00:16:02,420
and your fifteen years all going down to
a phone company building

280
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:06,560

like your your parcel organization

281
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:11,530
and telling security guard up here to
get your ID card and to this day he has

282
00:16:11,530 --> 00:16:12,780

00:16:12,780 --> 00:16:16,520
are this eighty-year much it not now

284
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:21,770
I'll need to to not believe somebody on
the telephone so yeah

285
00:16:21,770 --> 00:16:25,730
that like anything can happen anything
similar not not quite as

286
00:16:25,730 --> 00:16:29,780
as gutsy at Emanuel yeah I I'm starting
a rough but I doubt that that very same

287
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:31,860
story thing happen to me I was said

288
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:36,010
their prisons where was the end because
related the other story day at

289
00:16:36,010 --> 00:16:39,800
me humanizing he's lost it is a memo
saying that we had to turn in our ID

290
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:42,050
cards Visa replace them with new orange
ones

291
00:16:42,050 --> 00:16:45,940
and I really like the white 1i had on so
I mailed it out

292
00:16:45,940 --> 00:16:48,980
that night you know the mail it
inspected goes out cell

293
00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:52,930
but if the me the attorney-client mail
is not so I had to rate to attorney but

294
00:16:52,930 --> 00:16:54,360
as just a friend of mine I just said

295
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:57,950
attorney in whenever I mailed it out and
then I was issued next tried to send it

296
00:16:57,950 --> 00:17:00,200
can find it by the macedonian

297
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:03,890
campsite so I asked why I was had my own
car did

298
00:17:03,890 --> 00:17:07,849
to have after afterwards now I it's
always a good idea if you gonna do

299
00:17:07,849 --> 00:17:10,329
something like this too little research
first

300
00:17:10,329 --> 00:17:14,020
I and I found out that subway is

and any our social engineering history
that you'd like to share

387
00:22:55,399 --> 00:22:59,049
corporations are absolutely my favorite
because the as we just saw them

388
00:22:59,049 --> 00:23:02,229
the monolith have their corporation
allows you to really manipulate people

389
00:23:02,229 --> 00:23:05,389
because they're so certain is mines at
how things work and

390
00:23:05,389 --> 00:23:09,690
stronger tells bob many many years ago
when I was even smaller than I am now

391
00:23:09,690 --> 00:23:13,639
not applying for an internship there you

very inch

393
00:23:16,839 --> 00:23:20,859
uninterested in who I was and mountain
going to the standard morning questions

394
00:23:20,859 --> 00:23:23,039
I'm sure you've all got there before

395
00:23:23,039 --> 00:23:27,329
so I tired mealy of the bad realize no
harm not gonna get this I decided

396
00:23:27,329 --> 00:23:31,649
mom I like information security a sea of
I can push this I certainly know

397
00:23:31,649 --> 00:23:35,409
answer your questions oh you know my
favorite color is blue bubble blower

398
00:23:35,409 --> 00:23:38,899
I'm a really warm person on the team
builder but I'm really interested in

399
00:23:38,899 --> 00:23:41,210
Windows Server 2003 de Guise user

400
00:23:41,210 --> 00:23:44,710
oh yeah its original point run through
dancers asking more and more the

401
00:23:44,710 --> 00:23:47,999
appointed subtle questions about their
corporate structure other networks

402
00:23:47,999 --> 00:23:49,049
things like that

403
00:23:49,049 --> 00:23:52,729
all how many password I can I was like
the password the judges upper case lower

404
00:23:52,729 --> 00:23:53,759
case now

405
00:23:53,759 --> 00:23:58,489
on a young kid I can be a threat and %uh
so this one for now in 20-30 minutes

406
00:23:58,489 --> 00:24:01,569
just little subtle things and so she
said you know great thanks we'll give

407
00:24:01,569 --> 00:24:02,499
you a call

408
00:24:02,499 --> 00:24:06,169
and done as are walking down the St to
dismiss the IT director Mike

409
00:24:06,169 --> 00:24:10,129
always you guys use Windows dozens were
three S key to your house interaction

410
00:24:10,129 --> 00:24:10,759
why

411
00:24:10,759 --> 00:24:14,960
Z with next next characters not yet ya
to Miller's the same never got that call

412
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:16,539
back

413
00:24:16,539 --> 00:24:20,249
but it goes to show that in situations
like that where there's an expected from

414
00:24:20,249 --> 00:24:22,869
Malik how things work you really can't
come

415
00:24:22,869 --> 00:24:26,589
very serious threat by just interjecting
a little bit of

416
00:24:26,589 --> 00:24:29,759
per persuasiveness with just a little
bit have

417
00:24:29,759 --> 00:24:33,529
knowledge of how things work against
people who are not expecting it

418
00:24:33,529 --> 00:24:35,609
the subway employees are going to be a
good example because they're not

419
00:24:35,609 --> 00:24:37,158
expecting a call like this

420
00:24:37,159 --> 00:24:41,479
well I D is it's not regular so when you
go outside the norm people don't know

421
00:24:41,479 --> 00:24:42,279
how to react

422
00:24:42,279 --> 00:24:45,970
and the I'm voluntarily give up
information they should absolutely not

423
00:24:45,970 --> 00:24:46,950
giving up

424
00:24:46,950 --> 00:24:49,970
especially when it comes to corporate
networks I'm pretty sure everyone here

425
00:24:49,970 --> 00:24:52,659
knows it happens when someone gets the
password when

426
00:24:52,659 --> 00:24:55,929
or things like s the version numbers
your emails

427
00:24:55,929 --> 00:25:00,029
clear into our servers in things like
that gets very very dangerous a special

428
00:25:00,029 --> 00:25:00,739
one

429
00:25:00,739 --> 00:25:03,749
that information get some say the the
public

430
00:25:03,749 --> 00:25:06,989
I feel a little guilty picking on fast
food people but it is fun

431
00:25:06,989 --> 00:25:11,470
on we a number years ago I think we did
I was at a Pizza Hut

432
00:25:11,470 --> 00:25:15,690
on something downtown worry convinced on
that at a certain time they had to turn

433
00:25:15,690 --> 00:25:18,669
the cash registers of

434
00:25:18,669 --> 00:25:23,119
I wasn't the Taco Bell okay that's I
will try to talk about tonight on larry

435
00:25:23,119 --> 00:25:24,220
didn't do them again

436
00:25:24,220 --> 00:25:27,460
are and and I think you went down there
and i actually

437
00:25:27,460 --> 00:25:30,849
they had to be reminded but when when
they were mine to Dayton best to make

438
00:25:30,849 --> 00:25:33,849
people stand on line for thing about
five minutes without doing anything

439
00:25:33,849 --> 00:25:38,799
and done it's a small victory for on a
wide by

440
00:25:38,799 --> 00:25:42,190
Johannes yeah a

441
00:25:42,190 --> 00:25:46,419
buy a Wii has anyone ever tried to
subway diet

442
00:25:46,419 --> 00:25:50,579
no okie I thought so iomega

443
00:25:50,579 --> 00:25:53,799
okay I mean there's so many stories I
could tell

444
00:25:53,799 --> 00:25:57,158
one of my favorite stories so i'm i'm
i'm part of this group called monochrome

445
00:25:57,159 --> 00:26:00,479
and a couple of years ago we were
invited a

446
00:26:00,479 --> 00:26:03,960
to be the official Austrian
representatives a at one of the biggest

447
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:06,749
art shows on the planet the biennial in
Sao Paulo

448
00:26:06,749 --> 00:26:10,519
and the great thing about that story is
not really try to reduce it to

449
00:26:10,519 --> 00:26:14,329
to the bare minimum is that it had the
couple have really interesting social

450
00:26:14,329 --> 00:26:15,289
engineering

451
00:26:15,289 --> 00:26:19,609
levels at different points of the
project the story was that we were asked

452
00:26:19,609 --> 00:26:20,609
to represent

453
00:26:20,609 --> 00:26:24,349
Austria at this biennial but we told the
curator that we don't want to do that

454
00:26:24,349 --> 00:26:24,879
because

455
00:26:24,879 --> 00:26:28,220
Austria had a really really bad
right-wing government back then and we

456
00:26:28,220 --> 00:26:30,659
didn't 13 percent Austrian at that level

457
00:26:30,659 --> 00:26:34,829
%ah and she really insisted in said come
on think about something really cool and

458
00:26:34,829 --> 00:26:35,539
then we said

459
00:26:35,539 --> 00:26:39,450
okie will have to press release may
differ you tomorrow morning and she sent

460
00:26:39,450 --> 00:26:40,159
it out

461
00:26:40,159 --> 00:26:43,409
and the press release stated that the
office loss and representative at the

462
00:26:43,409 --> 00:26:46,379
biennial would be a guy called dr. Paul
two-month

463
00:26:46,379 --> 00:26:49,509
and all the newspapers reported about
that but of course that guy never

464
00:26:49,509 --> 00:26:51,049
existed so we can like

465
00:26:51,049 --> 00:26:55,099
made up this fake artist the cool thing
was that because

466
00:26:55,099 --> 00:26:59,049
this press release was sent out suddenly
all the newspapers report about that

467
00:26:59,049 --> 00:27:00,879
because journalist on Google

468
00:27:00,879 --> 00:27:04,769
and suddenly but this guy

469
00:27:04,769 --> 00:27:08,819
did didn't exist this I avatar was
suddenly withdrew percent in Austria at

470
00:27:08,819 --> 00:27:09,700
the biennial

471
00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:13,609
in some pollen Brazil so we went to
Brazil

472
00:27:13,609 --> 00:27:17,918
and in Brazil we as monochrome is the
group we we're course

473
00:27:17,919 --> 00:27:21,159
not important because they were waiting
for be appalled Thoman

474
00:27:21,159 --> 00:27:25,460
and we were just his technical support
team so a couple of people there late

475
00:27:25,460 --> 00:27:29,159
you relate hanging stupid paintings and
stuff like that had been drinking beer

476
00:27:29,159 --> 00:27:29,799
in

477
00:27:29,799 --> 00:27:33,168
having a nice time chatting to other
technical support teams

478
00:27:33,169 --> 00:27:36,839
because nobody was interested in us and
nobody gave his business cards

479
00:27:36,839 --> 00:27:40,678
up because we were not important we were
no curator's or no rights is which is

480
00:27:40,679 --> 00:27:44,529
like the technical support team were
like the bottom of the hierarchy beer

481
00:27:44,529 --> 00:27:48,539
but because we're the bottom of the
hierarchy we got access

482
00:27:48,539 --> 00:27:52,950
a to a lot of interesting infrastructure
at the biennial there

483
00:27:52,950 --> 00:27:57,169
but the most important part was that all
the other technical support teams

484
00:27:57,169 --> 00:28:00,769
who felt that they were on the same
level as us who had you know like beers

485
00:28:00,769 --> 00:28:01,289
with us

486
00:28:01,289 --> 00:28:05,269
cetera those guys %uh after a couple of
days

487
00:28:05,269 --> 00:28:08,429
which has told them what's going on so
we told them that we are actually the

488
00:28:08,429 --> 00:28:10,879
artists that we'd that the guy doesn't
exist

489
00:28:10,879 --> 00:28:14,359
that he is not watching porn channel and
therefore not

490
00:28:14,359 --> 00:28:17,619
coming to the biennial in doing his job
a

491
00:28:17,619 --> 00:28:22,639
because those guys suddenly knew more
than all the other guys at the biennial

492
00:28:22,639 --> 00:28:25,899
but topped you readers and top artists
and whatever

493
00:28:25,899 --> 00:28:29,919
so these suddenly had this power of
light we know that that guy doesn't

494
00:28:29,919 --> 00:28:33,999
exist and we can do something crazy with
that and he started telling

495
00:28:33,999 --> 00:28:37,079
interesting crazy stories about the
lives and times have

496
00:28:37,079 --> 00:28:41,539
be appalled home on that yet I

497
00:28:41,539 --> 00:28:47,960
I and severe potomac had sex with the
curators from Argentina on the second

498
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:49,759
floor bathroom in

499
00:28:49,759 --> 00:28:53,319
stuff like that yeah I really like
directed to three technicians and some

500
00:28:53,319 --> 00:28:54,918
of the stories were kinda like roots

501
00:28:54,919 --> 00:28:59,029
but still it was quite interesting to
see like the gazers

502
00:28:59,029 --> 00:29:02,799
of rumors about these non existing
character bursting out

503
00:29:02,799 --> 00:29:06,408
and and the swapping in all the
different corners of the biennium

504
00:29:06,409 --> 00:29:10,230
but and thats the last part of the story
because there's so many stories

505
00:29:10,230 --> 00:29:13,960
just about your part or mine a a guy eat

506
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:17,549
a who was the official representatives
of taiwan

507
00:29:17,549 --> 00:29:22,849
a he was a couple of white cubes next to
the white cube with your part or mine

508
00:29:22,849 --> 00:29:26,609
and he had a problem so we found out
about that because he sent a public

509
00:29:26,609 --> 00:29:30,689
letter to other artists but no one was
really interested in his problem

510
00:29:30,690 --> 00:29:34,769
so the problem was this disc I a chance
to John

511
00:29:34,769 --> 00:29:38,039
a and he had the problem that overnights

512
00:29:38,039 --> 00:29:41,649
the administration had removed are
altered

513
00:29:41,649 --> 00:29:45,279
his name tag his name tag in our case it
was the airport Oman

514
00:29:45,279 --> 00:29:48,799
Austria in his case it was genti John
taiwan

515
00:29:48,799 --> 00:29:51,950
and they had removed the Taiwan and
replace the time one by

516
00:29:51,950 --> 00:29:56,710
Taipei Museum of Fine Arts and he didn't
know why did happen and it was really

517
00:29:56,710 --> 00:30:00,749
important for him to be difficult I'm
unease representatives because

518
00:30:00,749 --> 00:30:05,649
he heavily criticised taiwan and it was
important for him to be the taiwanese

519
00:30:05,649 --> 00:30:08,470
representative so he was kinda pissed
about

520
00:30:08,470 --> 00:30:12,119
my stupid stupid museum a man not my
home country's name there

521
00:30:12,119 --> 00:30:16,700
so we tried to talk to the curator's
sent to the administration

522
00:30:16,700 --> 00:30:20,049
nobody told me anything but because we

523
00:30:20,049 --> 00:30:24,299
up were kinda like the technical support
teams renew your technical support teams

524
00:30:24,299 --> 00:30:27,859
and the of course know everything so we
find out

525
00:30:27,859 --> 00:30:32,230
that China had intervenes so one-china
policy so

526
00:30:32,230 --> 00:30:36,069
China didn't want to have taiwan

527
00:30:36,069 --> 00:30:40,809
the s its own national representation
there so the Chinese delegation had

528
00:30:40,809 --> 00:30:42,519
intervened and said

529
00:30:42,519 --> 00:30:45,889
if the Taiwanese guy get its own
representation there

530
00:30:45,889 --> 00:30:49,980
we will cause massive diplomatic trouble
and we said hey we cannot

531
00:30:49,980 --> 00:30:53,169
let that be so we have to help the guy
in some way in

532
00:30:53,169 --> 00:30:57,369
form of solidarity so what we did is
because the letters

533
00:30:57,369 --> 00:31:00,769
you know change n church and Taiwan it
word

534
00:31:00,769 --> 00:31:04,399
work unlike adhesive lead is a good just
like take them off

535
00:31:04,399 --> 00:31:08,129
so we took off the tee from Austria a
and we had a ti

536
00:31:08,129 --> 00:31:11,609
and then went to Canada and said come on
is something Canadians have 3 A's had

537
00:31:11,609 --> 00:31:17,589
only three years

538
00:31:17,589 --> 00:31:21,849
and then he had a any good on a front
ratio I

539
00:31:21,849 --> 00:31:27,259
and the only problem was to W because
they're fucking no countries with w.va.

540
00:31:27,259 --> 00:31:31,389
but we had quick to leap goal %ah

541
00:31:31,389 --> 00:31:35,970
and then after a coupla hours running
around we had Taiwan is like very

542
00:31:35,970 --> 00:31:39,989
can't be trashy we on the outside of his
white Cuban suddenly

543
00:31:39,989 --> 00:31:43,940
he had his reposition back again the
cool thing that happened was that many

544
00:31:43,940 --> 00:31:44,379
many

545
00:31:44,379 --> 00:31:48,239
journalists took pictures of that
reported about the whole thing

546
00:31:48,239 --> 00:31:52,159
and my favorite article about the whole
thing

547
00:31:52,159 --> 00:31:55,859
appeared in a tie Pete Times week after
the whole incident

548
00:31:55,859 --> 00:31:59,609
and a type B times is the second largest
newspaper in taiwan your

549
00:31:59,609 --> 00:32:05,069
and this newspaper had the headline
Austinites is the appall Tallman seeds

550
00:32:05,069 --> 00:32:09,220
taiwan

551
00:32:09,220 --> 00:32:13,990
and the

552
00:32:13,990 --> 00:32:17,270
%ah

553
00:32:17,270 --> 00:32:20,830
so and my final word to that is

554
00:32:20,830 --> 00:32:25,120
and non existing I to save the country
that should not exist that's like as

555
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:25,890
radical as

556
00:32:25,890 --> 00:32:32,750
post-modernism can get I are you sure
you're not a yes man

557
00:32:32,750 --> 00:32:37,940
while all right arm

558
00:32:37,940 --> 00:32:41,730
I can idea for something it its its
kinda surprising to me but you know what

559
00:32:41,730 --> 00:32:45,290
we've never actually tried to social
engineer Mitt Romney

560
00:32:45,290 --> 00:32:50,950
Paul the

561
00:32:50,950 --> 00:32:54,220
how did we miss that I don't know

562
00:32:54,220 --> 00:32:59,990
honest and that's very rich yeah so

563
00:32:59,990 --> 00:33:02,990
we're going to correct that

564
00:33:02,990 --> 00:33:06,940
arm he is only my know there's another
convention coming up later this year

565
00:33:06,940 --> 00:33:09,030
called the Republican National
Convention

566
00:33:09,030 --> 00:33:12,190
its traditional that one of us gets
arrested at at those things

567
00:33:12,190 --> 00:33:16,240
%uh this one is happening in Tampa
Florida

568
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:19,450
now an interesting story I just found
out about this right before the panel

569
00:33:19,450 --> 00:33:23,990
are but someone within the republican
party has booked this particular hotel

570
00:33:23,990 --> 00:33:25,230
there were about to call

571
00:33:25,230 --> 00:33:29,080
are for the duration of the party's
national convention in Tampa

572
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:32,970
in August Lee August now exactly who
made the reservation is a mystery

573
00:33:32,970 --> 00:33:37,820
officials with the a hotel confirm that
someone within the GOP organization they

574
00:33:37,820 --> 00:33:38,669
won't say who

575
00:33:38,670 --> 00:33:43,400
has been unofficial reservation for the
entire hotel for the convention

576
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:47,080
I so I'm obviously nothing has been

577
00:33:47,080 --> 00:33:50,630
has been verified we figured wanna give
them a call and see if maybe we can get

578
00:33:50,630 --> 00:33:52,580
some information out of them as far as a

579
00:33:52,580 --> 00:33:56,679
I if someone made a reservation if
someone is as a name

580

awesome can contact information of
course it is 9 30 on a Saturday night

581
00:34:00,790 --> 00:34:03,340

advantage

582
00:34:03,340 --> 00:34:06,090
because you're not getting the people
that are there in the middle the day

583
00:34:06,090 --> 00:34:07,300

622
00:36:46,509 --> 00:36:49,670
which you wouldn't have known otherwise
may be an issue with the person who had

623
00:36:49,670 --> 00:36:50,949
spoken to her earlier

624
00:36:50,949 --> 00:36:54,880
someone from the in I would have also
said campaign office and said his office

625
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:55,890
examined ever had a

626
00:36:55,890 --> 00:36:59,150
more worrying about the intensity right
I thought he did a good job with the

627
00:36:59,150 --> 00:37:00,589
with you know

628
00:37:00,589 --> 00:37:04,308
given that they didn't have access to
that I thought as five minutes before

629
00:37:04,309 --> 00:37:05,769
the panel so yeah it's

630
00:37:05,769 --> 00:37:10,839
its the best they could do I have an
address for the office

631
00:37:10,839 --> 00:37:14,589
I in Tampa for the run the office I and
hope was that

632
00:37:14,589 --> 00:37:17,880
somebody there was a all your you guys
again okay at and talk to this

00:37:19,039 --> 00:37:23,509
on and on and it does work sometimes
doesn't work every time

635
00:37:23,509 --> 00:37:27,279
but on move ok we'll keep trying
something else

636
00:37:27,279 --> 00:37:34,279
I'm are we do want to allow time for
questions and answers are stories from

637
00:37:35,589 --> 00:37:38,369
the audience as well where should we
tell people to walk up to

638
00:37:38,369 --> 00:37:42,819
far over there okay I can see it is Mike
staring into the Sun here

639
00:37:42,819 --> 00:37:46,819
ok in the middle as i've anyone has
questions for the panel please

640
00:37:46,819 --> 00:37:50,249
please ask me at least one more attempt
to something to get some information

641
00:37:50,249 --> 00:37:51,039
later on

642
00:37:51,039 --> 00:37:54,109
I and the other a story 0 comments folks

643
00:37:54,109 --> 00:37:57,739
always okay

644
00:37:57,739 --> 00:38:01,009
are someone's there i think thats your
shadowy figure out a good

645
00:38:01,009 --> 00:38:04,079
yet

646
00:38:04,079 --> 00:38:07,759
it's called the microphone you can use
both should yeah it's just sore

647
00:38:07,759 --> 00:38:11,689
you know high-speed lines head I see not
well I

648
00:38:11,689 --> 00:38:16,229
um actions had this question since the
last

649
00:38:16,229 --> 00:38:19,390
time as here that on we have always

650
00:38:19,390 --> 00:38:22,679
techniques for errors or getting people
to do things could be

651
00:38:22,679 --> 00:38:27,069
use them to try and maybe influence the
political process in this country to try

652
00:38:27,069 --> 00:38:27,890
and

653
00:38:27,890 --> 00:38:32,328
affect change try by lying on the
telephone juror

654
00:38:32,329 --> 00:38:35,929
I'm not at work as well as anything else

655
00:38:35,929 --> 00:38:39,609
i guess i larger scale mmm I mean

656
00:38:39,609 --> 00:38:42,890
is all kinds of things you can do to
manipulate people and get them to our

657
00:38:42,890 --> 00:38:47,140
to change the way I mean I yes men are
pervs example that is I think you know

658
00:38:47,140 --> 00:38:48,189
the earlier today

659
00:38:48,189 --> 00:38:51,649
the way they were able to change the
conversation and get people talking

660
00:38:51,650 --> 00:38:53,199
about something yet that's that's

661
00:38:53,199 --> 00:38:57,339
I you can certainly do that but yet we
really good and you have to

662
00:38:57,339 --> 00:39:01,019
the to know who to head and what to say
but

663
00:39:01,019 --> 00:39:04,429
yes should experiment always open to
ideas

664
00:39:04,429 --> 00:39:08,959
yeah i i think to a the main problem now
the Z is that the mainstream media a

665
00:39:08,959 --> 00:39:09,509
very much

666
00:39:09,509 --> 00:39:13,509
interested in prankster interested in
subversive interesting stories

667
00:39:13,509 --> 00:39:16,640
so in the meantime we have the problem
that we have to

668
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:19,719
create ways to serve work the system

669
00:39:19,719 --> 00:39:22,839
without being subverted ourselves
because a

670
00:39:22,839 --> 00:39:27,808
if you end up as 25 second segment on
CNN that's kinda funny

671
00:39:27,809 --> 00:39:31,140
it's not where you want and I'll cyl you
have to

672
00:39:31,140 --> 00:39:35,618
the that the media system is so complex
the more complex the prank years

673
00:39:35,619 --> 00:39:41,049
the bed it's actually ease so a I think
we have to be careful not to feed the

674
00:39:41,049 --> 00:39:41,759
system

675
00:39:41,759 --> 00:39:44,799
with the she did actually wants cyl yeah

676
00:39:44,799 --> 00:39:47,509
it to find the conversation

677
00:39:47,510 --> 00:39:51,290
don't the last questions or they'll try
to frame a story

678
00:39:51,290 --> 00:39:56,450
in a particular way and on you don't
have to play by those rules you can

679
00:39:56,450 --> 00:39:59,750
base to say no this is what the
important issue is easy enough times

680
00:39:59,750 --> 00:40:03,550
they're going to hear it I mean I'll the
folks Occupy Wall Street they were able

681
00:40:03,550 --> 00:40:04,770
to do that last year

682
00:40:04,770 --> 00:40:08,130
where at first it was portrayed in one
particular way and they raise their

683
00:40:08,130 --> 00:40:09,079
voices have been a

684
00:40:09,079 --> 00:40:11,910
did other things and all the sudden
everybody was talking about whether I

685
00:40:11,910 --> 00:40:12,770
succeeded

686
00:40:12,770 --> 00:40:15,910
that's open to debate but people start
talking about

687
00:40:15,910 --> 00:40:20,660
a different subject in the media
initially wanted to so you can do it at

688
00:40:20,660 --> 00:40:24,170
thank you sure next question exits

689
00:40:24,170 --> 00:40:27,920
in responses question they already do
that it's called push polling

690
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:31,099
people call up and say hi i'm taking a
survey

691
00:40:31,099 --> 00:40:34,690
a if I told you that Mitt Romney kicks
puppies

692
00:40:34,690 --> 00:40:39,180
with that influence your vote if I said
that Mitt Romney

693
00:40:39,180 --> 00:40:42,819
does this with that influence your vote
and

694
00:40:42,819 --> 00:40:46,089
they might be taking a survey but
they're putting these things out there

695
00:40:46,089 --> 00:40:50,160
in a way that you're not expecting so
it's already being done

696
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:57,160
thank you I'm looking it up right now

697
00:40:58,299 --> 00:41:01,309
the so ever agree

698
00:41:01,309 --> 00:41:04,559
anecdote actually is I think bernie
might have heard this one yr it is a

699
00:41:04,559 --> 00:41:07,880
last the winner I got a phone call from
someone

700
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:11,430
true who had found out that my domain
name was explain on site is a YouTube

701
00:41:11,430 --> 00:41:13,299
video Mitt Romney kicks a poppy

702
00:41:13,299 --> 00:41:18,210
is a a there's your answer so

703
00:41:18,210 --> 00:41:21,599
I got this phone call apparently there
were people who were scraping

704
00:41:21,599 --> 00:41:24,880
domain information to look for
expirations to try to sell

705
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:29,910
SSL Certificates and was komodo and so
this guy called the left a cryptic

706
00:41:29,910 --> 00:41:32,440
message he didn't identify who it was
from

707
00:41:32,440 --> 00:41:36,200
he just said you need to read renew your
domain name and you need to buy

708
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:40,520
hacker proof because if you don't you're
going to be vulnerable to let this

709
00:41:40,520 --> 00:41:41,210
message

710
00:41:41,210 --> 00:41:45,079
didn't identify himself though his great
social insurance I call them back

711
00:41:45,079 --> 00:41:49,359
pretended to be completely you know
oblivious to what he was talking about

712
00:41:49,359 --> 00:41:53,589
sspu what what and I had the guy on the
phone for about 20 minutes

713
00:41:53,589 --> 00:41:57,339
inhuman and I was going like so I need
to buy this he's like yeah because the

714
00:41:57,339 --> 00:41:58,690
hackers will get you nice a

715
00:41:58,690 --> 00:42:02,619
we'll you mean hackers the people that
you the social engineering thing

716
00:42:02,619 --> 00:42:06,650
with a call you on the phone and pretend
to be someone else is like yeah

717
00:42:06,650 --> 00:42:10,280
and I said and no one's ever done that
to you before is like no no they

718
00:42:10,280 --> 00:42:11,730
wouldn't do that to me

719
00:42:11,730 --> 00:42:15,599
and it went on for like 20 minutes and I
managed to find out

720
00:42:15,599 --> 00:42:19,540
how he got my name how he got my number
how it operates

721
00:42:19,540 --> 00:42:23,190
in all this information from him by
pretending to just

722
00:42:23,190 --> 00:42:27,650
not know what was going on and dropping
little things about hackers and social

723
00:42:27,650 --> 00:42:29,210
engineering drug the whole thing

724
00:42:29,210 --> 00:42:32,740
and it was fun brilliant that's right
that's exactly how you there

725
00:42:32,740 --> 00:42:38,869
by I hope you bought the product key
with because that is important that

726
00:42:38,869 --> 00:42:41,319
everybody by that because hackers will
get you otherwise

727
00:42:41,319 --> 00:42:44,690
not hackers are there they are used by

728
00:42:44,690 --> 00:42:49,130
by corporate america to cells so many
things because if you watch the media

729
00:42:49,130 --> 00:42:53,130
it's always hackers are the threat even
if even if a bank leaves a hundred

730
00:42:53,130 --> 00:42:53,910
thousand

731
00:42:53,910 --> 00:42:57,990
not people's names addresses social
security numbers on a website somewhere

732
00:42:57,990 --> 00:43:01,790
their text its hackers could have gotten
to this and they're the ones I could

733
00:43:01,790 --> 00:43:02,630
have done something bad

734
00:43:02,630 --> 00:43:05,690
now the company doing something bad by
leaving there in the first place

735
00:43:05,690 --> 00:43:09,010
so yet they use hackers to instill fear

736
00:43:09,010 --> 00:43:12,440
and that is a former social engineering
it victimizes people

737
00:43:12,440 --> 00:43:17,579
so be wary that yes guide earlier use
the phrase

738
00:43:17,579 --> 00:43:21,140
sometimes you have to bow out gracefully
and i was just wondering if maybe you

739
00:43:21,140 --> 00:43:22,509
wanted you could share story

740
00:43:22,510 --> 00:43:25,619
when you weren't able to do that you got
into some hot water

741
00:43:25,619 --> 00:43:30,869
or it can backfire use or something like
that on I actually want to get a czar by

742
00:43:30,869 --> 00:43:32,299
the Google security

743
00:43:32,299 --> 00:43:36,140
force %uh and it didn't work out you

744
00:43:36,140 --> 00:43:41,629
I failed with because like a couple of
years ago we had this idea of making the

745
00:43:41,630 --> 00:43:43,950
flash mob kinda boring in the meantime
so

746
00:43:43,950 --> 00:43:47,619
what we wanted to do was sculpture mops
because we hate public art

747
00:43:47,619 --> 00:43:52,930
and we thought why not going to you know
like at the Walmart parking space

748
00:43:52,930 --> 00:43:57,140
a or somewhere else go there bill the
public's help train under five minutes

749
00:43:57,140 --> 00:43:58,430
and just like takeoff

750
00:43:58,430 --> 00:44:01,680
solar and we did the same at

751
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:04,879
at the Google months and you the Google
headquarters

752
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:09,549
so we liked yet so we built this sir
really shitty piece of art called

753
00:44:09,549 --> 00:44:15,200
the Great Firewall of China Anna and
then we're waiting for

754
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:18,940
has a good guys and I really want to get
a sad but they just like stared at us

755
00:44:18,940 --> 00:44:21,430
for two hours and nothing happened it
was a major fail

756
00:44:21,430 --> 00:44:23,609
I

757
00:44:23,610 --> 00:44:25,960
II she told us up this story

758
00:44:25,960 --> 00:44:29,850
few years ago I'm not sure if I have all
the and are the details straight but

759
00:44:29,850 --> 00:44:33,509
done number years ago when I was in
school arm

760
00:44:33,510 --> 00:44:37,160
we were trying to find a high-speed
modem line %uh them for the ice be my

761
00:44:37,160 --> 00:44:39,500
mind in nineteen ninety six hundred
disposed to

762
00:44:39,500 --> 00:44:44,730
the 1200 were using and we call to the
the sysadmin at the University Dayton

763
00:44:44,730 --> 00:44:47,120
fine now this was and he was on to us
right away same

764
00:44:47,120 --> 00:44:50,759
you forgetting that we're not gonna give
you the information out there even try

765
00:44:50,760 --> 00:44:52,780
to get that information is sitting on it
like

766
00:44:52,780 --> 00:44:56,420
yeah Zazzle 52 and things like that he
was very indignant and the call did not

767
00:44:56,420 --> 00:44:57,360
end well

768
00:44:57,360 --> 00:45:02,090
we did not back out gracefully but a
couple of minutes later we thought you

769
00:45:02,090 --> 00:45:03,690
know this doesn't have to end this way

770
00:45:03,690 --> 00:45:08,630
and so we call back as somebody from the
administration building wanting

771
00:45:08,630 --> 00:45:12,810
wanted to know what just happened and
sure enough he had called somebody to

772
00:45:12,810 --> 00:45:14,180
report the incident

773
00:45:14,180 --> 00:45:18,029
and then we simply ask him what
information were they trying to get

774
00:45:18,030 --> 00:45:25,030
and he gave us the home

775
00:45:25,510 --> 00:45:28,880
its

776
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:32,400
it doesn't happen often but you now
never accept defeat

777
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:35,619
its expression

778
00:45:35,619 --> 00:45:39,009
sir Zelman speaking treating people with
paper

779
00:45:39,009 --> 00:45:42,710
and things expire gotta love letters
levy saying that

780
00:45:42,710 --> 00:45:46,869
my car warranty has expired and you you
get these things in the mail

781
00:45:46,869 --> 00:45:49,989
and they come in like is really
interesting and lives they like no

782
00:45:49,989 --> 00:45:53,549
you know returns as it is obvious that
the window like they look like total TV

783
00:45:53,549 --> 00:45:57,210
about grabbing like for you important
people saying to people they say

784
00:45:57,210 --> 00:46:00,759
and everything is a good bill think it
is total document looks

785
00:46:00,759 --> 00:46:05,470
think turnover it's like we are in no
way really is you know your car company

786
00:46:05,470 --> 00:46:09,950
I think about what is like speak to get
people to buy shit I mean just

787
00:46:09,950 --> 00:46:13,489
to treat you see it this crap you only
be like a shit

788
00:46:13,489 --> 00:46:17,329
my words he may be out how the hell yes
sir or getting

789
00:46:17,329 --> 00:46:21,670
getting some pentagon a bill in the mail
for some Canada Dry yellow page listings

790
00:46:21,670 --> 00:46:26,460
right or who's who in god knows why much
of your and corporate people will see

791
00:46:26,460 --> 00:46:29,479
that all a bill Senate to accounting
they pay and

792
00:46:29,479 --> 00:46:33,940
hundreds and hundreds thousands dollars
our people are a bit more dubious these

793
00:46:33,940 --> 00:46:34,710
things

794
00:46:34,710 --> 00:46:39,440
but now the questions

795
00:46:39,440 --> 00:46:42,979
I have one more question a lot try one
more thing

796
00:46:42,979 --> 00:46:46,749
we're about the same age

797
00:46:46,749 --> 00:46:50,880
and I'll back in the day when we were
growing up we usually call this thing

798
00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:53,349
they call social engineering now been a
bullshit artist

799
00:46:53,349 --> 00:46:56,539
but wait what do you think the
differences between

800
00:46:56,539 --> 00:46:59,569
be the bullshit artist be the social
engineer

801
00:46:59,569 --> 00:47:03,729
Mb is simply makiaa it's all the
motivation

802
00:47:03,729 --> 00:47:08,009
I mean when I try to sell anything where
we're trying to see what we can get

803
00:47:08,009 --> 00:47:11,130
see how secure things are in space for
testing the system

804
00:47:11,130 --> 00:47:14,210
I but marketer that somebody is going to

805
00:47:14,210 --> 00:47:17,769
wanna sell something by fooling people
and I'm

806
00:47:17,769 --> 00:47:21,619
and taking advantage up there in a sense
and

807
00:47:21,619 --> 00:47:25,640
in a way I like to think that we wake
people up to to keep that from happening

808
00:47:25,640 --> 00:47:26,368
to them

809
00:47:26,369 --> 00:47:30,809
by saying that not everything here is
true and there are very many ways to our

810
00:47:30,809 --> 00:47:34,749
to wind up trusting people people want
to trust other people that's that's just

811
00:47:34,749 --> 00:47:39,469
in our nature I you call somebody on the
telephone and and you say ya

812
00:47:39,469 --> 00:47:42,989
you know trying to help you out here
just doing my job has been a hard day

813
00:47:42,989 --> 00:47:44,160
how are you today

814
00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:47,729
and that's how you gain people's trust

815
00:47:47,729 --> 00:47:50,739
and yet also how you get things done
sometimes when you really want to get

816
00:47:50,739 --> 00:47:51,489
things done

817
00:47:51,489 --> 00:47:55,009
but down too often it's used

818
00:47:55,009 --> 00:47:58,359
to your detriment and you just have to
be very careful should I be giving out

819
00:47:58,359 --> 00:47:59,339
this information

820
00:47:59,339 --> 00:48:02,989
does this person really need to know
this are at the same time we shouldn't

821
00:48:02,989 --> 00:48:03,979
be so

822
00:48:03,979 --> 00:48:08,410
as much a fortress that we don't let
anybody in that we

823
00:48:08,410 --> 00:48:12,769
our which whatever I can enemy but just
think about it first before you actually

824
00:48:12,769 --> 00:48:14,569
and I give out anything

825
00:48:14,569 --> 00:48:18,979
a private nature yes I'm just to respond
to the last guy

826
00:48:18,979 --> 00:48:22,779
I gotta lotta phone calls trying to
peddle me

827
00:48:22,779 --> 00:48:27,239
auto insurance and I X or warranties and
shit like that

828
00:48:27,239 --> 00:48:32,589
arm the sucky thing for them was I
happen to know telemarketer

829
00:48:32,589 --> 00:48:36,299
law on and to know social engineering
tricks

830
00:48:36,299 --> 00:48:40,960
so if you tried to ask them who they're
calling from what company they r et

831
00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:41,539
cetera

832
00:48:41,539 --> 00:48:45,650
the hang up on you or the lawyer do
various other things

833
00:48:45,650 --> 00:48:49,559
on which is by the way violation federal
law arm

834
00:48:49,559 --> 00:48:54,019
so basically you do two things: our
first thought you play along

835
00:48:54,019 --> 00:48:58,630
and you act as if you're really fucking
stupid and attacked a phobic

836
00:48:58,630 --> 00:49:02,269
so you're like I love to buy this arm by

837
00:49:02,269 --> 00:49:06,430
like I'm I need to wait for my spouse to
come home to talk to them about it

838
00:49:06,430 --> 00:49:09,828
is there a direct phone line I can call
you back at

839
00:49:09,829 --> 00:49:14,569
not like your eight hundred-number are
is there an address I can mail a check

840
00:49:14,569 --> 00:49:18,200
to I don't really trust like credit
cards

841
00:49:18,200 --> 00:49:21,849
arm certain version is I got that info

842
00:49:21,849 --> 00:49:25,759
are I sent it to my lawyer i
successfully prosecuted them for a few

843
00:49:25,759 --> 00:49:26,309
thousand

844
00:49:26,309 --> 00:49:33,309
its

845
00:49:33,560 --> 00:49:38,140
and if you wanna know how and what the
laws are come talk to me at some point

846
00:49:38,140 --> 00:49:41,609
yeah I just have one remark to that on

847
00:49:41,610 --> 00:49:45,119
in any but it's not specifically to that
but but in general I think they're two

848
00:49:45,119 --> 00:49:46,420
possibilities to

849
00:49:46,420 --> 00:49:50,010
to to think about social engineering the
one possibility is

850
00:49:50,010 --> 00:49:54,619
to almost be an imposter to be as
realistic as possible in the role that

851
00:49:54,619 --> 00:49:55,470
your pledge

852
00:49:55,470 --> 00:49:59,240
another possibility is that works quite
well most of the time is

853
00:49:59,240 --> 00:50:02,680
that you're completely absurd for
example yep

854
00:50:02,680 --> 00:50:05,830
you've seen me walking around this is
like strange Soviet officer

855
00:50:05,830 --> 00:50:09,850
maybe the afternoon key we've been doing
this stick for ten years now and the

856
00:50:09,850 --> 00:50:11,330
first time we did that is

857
00:50:11,330 --> 00:50:15,860
when we we car like attack a small
village in Austria overnights

858
00:50:15,860 --> 00:50:19,080
and be decorated with giant soviet flex
and in them

859
00:50:19,080 --> 00:50:23,000
morning those guys were waking up and
seeing what the fuck is going on

860
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:26,600
others liked and their and we were
walking in soviet uniforms

861
00:50:26,600 --> 00:50:31,400
any quick I like occupying tonya a and
they were calling the police and singer

862
00:50:31,400 --> 00:50:33,440
russians are in waiting ur

863
00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:38,080
and and then the police showed up your

864
00:50:38,080 --> 00:50:42,790
and the police tried to talk to me but I
was not breaking character I watched the

865
00:50:42,790 --> 00:50:44,850
crazies Soviet officer daddy loves

866
00:50:44,850 --> 00:50:48,520
that is signed afternoon Anna what are
you doing here viewed

867
00:50:48,520 --> 00:50:53,540
this is an act of love you cannot coming
to our company fuck all of these little

868
00:50:53,540 --> 00:50:57,210
and I remain in character for half an
hour

869
00:50:57,210 --> 00:51:01,000
and after half an hour the one police
officer talked another police officer

870
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:02,700
and he pretty much said something like

871
00:51:02,700 --> 00:51:09,700
their idiots let's go and I mean of
course they didn't believe

872
00:51:09,960 --> 00:51:13,210
a in us but they were soul like

873
00:51:13,210 --> 00:51:17,670
it was kinda like the buffer overflow
for them i guess im and sometimes that's

874
00:51:17,670 --> 00:51:19,000
a good tool to use

875
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:22,480
but there is a limit in such motion
doing its very technical get to know the

876
00:51:22,480 --> 00:51:24,920
certain ways of doing things but they
did that Nick

877
00:51:24,920 --> 00:51:27,920
perfect example that decision to ring is
more acting

878
00:51:27,920 --> 00:51:31,000
formatted in just absolutely absurd when
I when I do I'll who works at my

879
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:31,530
teachings

880
00:51:31,530 --> 00:51:35,630
it's more acting skills how to present
yourself it's running a soviet office

881
00:51:35,630 --> 00:51:36,260
uniform

882
00:51:36,260 --> 00:51:39,810
demand your Soviet officer not breaking
that character you you go apply that

883
00:51:39,810 --> 00:51:42,000
same mentality to ever cared you create

884
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:45,200
with on a phone but in person it doesn't
matter but in the Ballinger

885
00:51:45,200 --> 00:51:49,280
gracefully got third why not you've
already failed a horrid

886
00:51:49,280 --> 00:51:52,780
yes II yes

887
00:51:52,780 --> 00:51:56,930
i'd I just I'm fine as many other
disturbing I we're gonna causing us 24

888
00:51:56,930 --> 00:51:59,359
hours I just found out they close at ten
o'clock in Saturday's

889
00:51:59,359 --> 00:52:02,430
aren't so this is gonna be as effective
as I was hoping because they want to

890
00:52:02,430 --> 00:52:03,750
customers in the store

891
00:52:03,750 --> 00:52:07,020
I'll verify that information first maybe
we can now on

892
00:52:07,020 --> 00:52:10,290
I'll change it a little bit so that it
would really like to call an olive

893
00:52:10,290 --> 00:52:12,270
garden can recall in all is well

894

restaurant chain on the plane now we're

895

where we're going to pass by this time

yeah why not me this is a a little more
the

923
00:54:42,120 --> 00:54:45,230
than a question more like a story but a
first about that you know you can just

924
00:54:45,230 --> 00:54:47,640
buy police badges

925
00:54:47,640 --> 00:54:51,069
and cell

926
00:54:51,070 --> 00:54:55,140
as long as they don't say police officer
it's not impersonating an officer

927
00:54:55,140 --> 00:54:58,290
you can buy them from the same company
that manufactures them in Week three

928
00:54:58,290 --> 00:55:01,550
weeks and as long as they don't say
you're an officer you're not an officer

929
00:55:01,550 --> 00:55:06,020
so I have one that says that network
operations engineer

953
00:57:21,859 --> 00:57:27,009
well this has been a catastrophe on part
we were at a time

954
00:57:27,009 --> 00:57:30,249
on but what I would have liked to have
done we'll try this again

955
00:57:30,249 --> 00:57:34,650
I would like to have the told them that
we're updating satellite feed for their

956
00:57:34,650 --> 00:57:35,480
TVs

957
00:57:35,480 --> 00:57:39,160
I she went down there before to see if I
they had to cable or satellite

958
00:57:39,160 --> 00:57:42,319
turns out they have neither they just
have commercials for themselves that

959
00:57:42,319 --> 00:57:43,579
they play constantly

960
00:57:43,579 --> 00:57:46,970
but they still get there from satellite
and it has to be updated occasionally

961
00:57:46,970 --> 00:57:50,329
and we're going to tell them the the you
have to turn your TV is off to receive

962
00:57:50,329 --> 00:57:52,079
the update for about 10 minutes

963
00:57:52,079 --> 00:57:55,839
and the you nasa worst thing for them to
do is turn off all their TVs

964
00:57:55,839 --> 00:57:59,160
but my experience shows they will do
things like that

965
00:57:59,160 --> 00:58:02,859
arm so what that they have entered the
following are there in the first place
