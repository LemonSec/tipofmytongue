everything the battle for the soul the
Republic alright

38
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:29,800
it's important wherever to create a
crossroads here so

39
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:33,510
I want to drop its the old I really hope
veteran

40
00:02:33,510 --> 00:02:40,510
and now I promise you will not
disappoint well ok

41
00:02:49,459 --> 00:02:52,879
bear with us a second work to stir get
my slider

42
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:56,120
that's right in the early days they were
running two hours late are

43
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:59,500
cell this is an improvement and we're
now obviously on the 3rd generation

44
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:00,610
attackers

45
00:03:00,610 --> 00:03:04,209
have its light verse advance a reverse
okay

46
00:03:04,209 --> 00:03:09,170
arm what evolved a few years ago was
that I would give one serious talk

47
00:03:09,170 --> 00:03:12,840
are we taking this by the way William

48
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:15,890
okay thank you

49
00:03:15,890 --> 00:03:20,010
about two years ago I started getting
one serious talk and then in the

50
00:03:20,010 --> 00:03:20,829
evenings

51
00:03:20,830 --> 00:03:24,599
usually at midnight on Saturday I do spy
improbable it's really not about spying

52
00:03:24,599 --> 00:03:28,220
it's about the 1800 books I've reviewed
Amazon

53
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:33,409
in ninety eight categories arm so I read
a liar

54
00:03:33,409 --> 00:03:36,510
and it continually pisses me off on

55
00:03:36,510 --> 00:03:39,530
so what I have here for you is a
briefing

56
00:03:39,530 --> 00:03:42,810
very quickly family trying to in 30
minutes at Mike over a little bit we'll

57
00:03:42,810 --> 00:03:43,780
do some questions

58
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:46,950
but the bulk of the questions I hope I
will answer

59
00:03:46,950 --> 00:03:50,879
on nom on Saturday now there's two

60
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:55,159
tiny URLs always see dash rotor

61
00:03:55,159 --> 00:03:58,929
or high from router it's called and the
o.r gash back

62
00:03:58,930 --> 00:04:04,080
oose dash reroute is is the home page
for open source everything

63
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:07,620
and the Twitter hashes up is down sign

64
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:11,110
open all the second hack

65
00:04:11,110 --> 00:04:15,640
is 26 jobs looking for someone with
really really high tech smarts

66
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:18,709
and Dom that's the o.r

67
00:04:18,709 --> 00:04:25,709
by Dash hack are and I tested it last
night now this is a logo that's evolving

68
00:04:26,290 --> 00:04:29,370
I started out twenty years ago

69
00:04:29,370 --> 00:04:32,470
Mar as a champion for open source
intelligence

70
00:04:32,470 --> 00:04:36,280
because I discovered when I stood up the
Marine Corps intelligence command

71
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:40,290
that ninety-five percent of what we
needed to know about third wheel shit

72
00:04:40,290 --> 00:04:42,389
holes was not in the secret database

73
00:04:42,389 --> 00:04:46,340
up because the spies had been busy
building technical collection agence

74
00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:47,100
rusher

75
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:52,020
China mom places like that so I started
the open source intelligence food fight

76
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:53,190
1988

77
00:04:53,190 --> 00:04:56,500
and I created the golden candle which
you see here in the middle

78
00:04:56,500 --> 00:05:00,479
I then continue to evolve and realize
that

79
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:04,389
we have 8 intelligence tribes and when I
use the word intelligence are really

80
00:05:04,389 --> 00:05:04,930
talking

81
00:05:04,930 --> 00:05:08,419
in a sense love decision support

82
00:05:08,419 --> 00:05:11,580
we're spending eighty billion dollars a
year to date on secret intelligence

83
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:13,250
collection

84
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:17,130
their general tony's any from the US
Marine Corps has said provided him as

85
00:05:17,130 --> 00:05:18,969
commander CENTCOM with

86
00:05:18,970 --> 00:05:22,520
act best 4 percent of what he needs to
know

87
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:26,000
to which I would add nothing for
everyone else from agriculture to energy

88
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,100
to health to a Veterans Affairs

89
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:31,669
so they're actually 8 information trucks

90
00:05:31,669 --> 00:05:34,870
and the challenge in the 21st century is
going to be to get

91
00:05:34,870 --> 00:05:39,030
all a dove those tribes to share all
their information all the time

92
00:05:39,030 --> 00:05:42,070
and so I published a book no

93
00:05:42,070 --> 00:05:47,650
this is just my little reminder on this
is the battle for the soul Republic part

94
00:05:47,650 --> 00:05:52,720
on evil in the United States today

95
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:56,960
is bracketed by Google on one side the
National Security Agency on the other

96
00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:01,989
and I'm not a happy camper now this is
the plan

97
00:06:01,990 --> 00:06:06,400
and I ran for president I was accepted
as a reform party candidate

98
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:11,630
arm I did it for six weeks I did it for
two reasons the first was to put on one

99
00:06:11,630 --> 00:06:13,219
website

100
00:06:13,220 --> 00:06:17,180
everything I had ever learned from a
whole buncha people about what a proper

101
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:20,210
honest president should look like

102
00:06:20,210 --> 00:06:23,849
and I'll tell you the first nine nobody
now running including Ron Paul and

103
00:06:23,850 --> 00:06:25,280
Dennis Kucinich

104
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:29,979
is a proper president because they're
all about them

105
00:06:29,979 --> 00:06:35,090
not a single person now running is about
creating electoral reform

106
00:06:35,090 --> 00:06:38,750
leveling the playing field bringing the
six small parties back in

107
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:43,800
are and actually creating a coalition
cabinet a balanced budget and so forth

108
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:47,740
all they want is their share of the
two-party Turnpike

109
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:51,180
alright arm now do the math

110
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:55,020
if we could get we have three hundred
million citizens roughly $200 million

111
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:56,740
eligible voters oven happy

112
00:06:56,740 --> 00:07:01,830
vote on any given year if we could get a
hundred million voters to put ten

113
00:07:01,830 --> 00:07:03,940
dollars each

114
00:07:03,940 --> 00:07:07,020
or $50 million to put twenty dollars
each

115
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:12,030
at a billion dollars and if you combine
that with our capacity to do social

116
00:07:12,030 --> 00:07:15,800
networking and influencing in a vacuum I
would stop

117
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:20,289
with its fingers up a task arm in
actually occupy

118
00:07:20,289 --> 00:07:23,460
the home offices of our senators and
representatives we could turn this

119
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:24,319
country around

120
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:30,340
over NYK be only thing that can beat
organize money is organized people and

121
00:07:30,340 --> 00:07:30,800
we

122
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:36,270
are the most disc organized by just sad
sacks I've ever seen

123
00:07:36,270 --> 00:07:39,719
which upsets me I'm

124
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:44,009
so this is my yeah I'm my campaign logo

125
00:07:44,009 --> 00:07:47,009
with four color selector reform a
coalition cabinet

126
00:07:47,009 --> 00:07:50,720
announced in advance anybody who cannot
pick

127
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:53,940
and announced a coalition cabinet in
advance of Election Day

128
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:58,000
is not qualified to be President United
States of America

129
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,220
and their either not qualified because
they don't know how

130
00:08:01,220 --> 00:08:04,849
whether or not qualified because they
lack the integrity to do that

131
00:08:04,849 --> 00:08:08,139
and I specifically accuse Barack Obama
and Mitt Romney

132
00:08:08,139 --> 00:08:13,660
lacking the integrity to lead america
today

133
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:18,169
so this is what I get the test the
two-party turning I was accepted by the

134
00:08:18,169 --> 00:08:19,030
reform party

135
00:08:19,030 --> 00:08:23,280
registered created a website it still
standing big bet USA downward

136
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:27,099
are launched several campaigns YouTube's

137
00:08:27,099 --> 00:08:30,949
I corresponded with every single
presidential candidate other than Mitt

138
00:08:30,949 --> 00:08:33,519
Romney and Barack Obama and I met

139
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:37,349
are half of them personally

140
00:08:37,349 --> 00:08:41,529
I came up here to new york to brief
occupy an electoral reform in that video

141
00:08:41,529 --> 00:08:43,700
made by someone else went viral

142
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:46,839
well I'd still up I consulted with

143
00:08:46,839 --> 00:08:51,290
the one of the leaders in the Tea Party
I've tried often with the independence

144
00:08:51,290 --> 00:08:51,649
but

145
00:08:51,649 --> 00:08:54,660
Jackie sale it is not about playing well
with others

146
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:58,630
on and finally the small parks the small
parties

147
00:08:58,630 --> 00:09:03,149
heavy rich diversity of opinion that
needs to be in this conversation

148
00:09:03,149 --> 00:09:08,200
but may our sole focus on their own
conversation I specifically include Ron

149
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:10,709
Paul on libertarians an apology stirs in

150
00:09:10,709 --> 00:09:13,980
and all these folks on dear actually not

151
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:17,580
having a conversation with anybody there
talking themselves

152
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:20,580
ons is very frustrating

153
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:23,940
now this is the substance that is on the
website

154
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:28,550
balance budget no brainer it is now
documented that fifty cents out of every

155
00:09:28,550 --> 00:09:29,490
federal dollar

156
00:09:29,490 --> 00:09:33,290
whether its agriculture or energy or
health or defense

157
00:09:33,290 --> 00:09:39,050
fifty cents out of every dollar his
waist in defense is closer to 70 percent

158
00:09:39,050 --> 00:09:43,200
4 percent up the military force takes
eighty percent of the casualties and

159
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:45,820
gets one percent of the budget

160
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:49,540
the other 99 percent in the defense
budget in my judgment

161
00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:52,719
is fraud waste and abuse its corporate
vaporware

162
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:58,260
take to cyber command in an essay is an
example

163
00:09:58,260 --> 00:10:02,209
I did a study they accomplish something
in in Homeland Security today a

164
00:10:02,209 --> 00:10:08,110
America cyberskin at the time the
exactly sixty seven people doing code

165
00:10:08,110 --> 00:10:09,899
level research

166
00:10:09,899 --> 00:10:13,890
on cybersecurity and all those only
trial for doing

167
00:10:13,890 --> 00:10:19,089
defensive code level research now if you
get a teacher to sixty-seven people one

168
00:10:19,089 --> 00:10:21,649
million dollars

169
00:10:21,649 --> 00:10:25,880
then everything from the $67 million
over here to the fifteen billion over

170
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:27,839
here to keep Alexander spending

171
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:31,209
on Cyber Command is corporate vapor

172
00:10:31,209 --> 00:10:34,519
where it's not real

173
00:10:34,519 --> 00:10:39,269
okay so we have this massive virtual
self licking ice cream cone that keeps

174
00:10:39,269 --> 00:10:40,720
consuming dollars

175
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:44,240
and is actually not doing anything to
make america safer in fact an assay was

176
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:45,470
given the mission

177
00:10:45,470 --> 00:10:50,500
over a decade ago are securing US
business communications

178
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:54,430
and they chose not to do so because it
was more important to them to be able to

179
00:10:54,430 --> 00:10:56,240
listen

180
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:59,730
that US businesses than it was to
actually protect

181
00:10:59,730 --> 00:11:05,180
US businesses so your government is not
doing its job

182
00:11:05,180 --> 00:11:08,700
lecter reform on the issues are we can
have some discussions about

183
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:12,540
preconditions revolution allotted the
preconditions revolution exist today in

184
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:13,920
the United States

185
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:17,310
jobs in a quest to cost economics

186
00:11:17,310 --> 00:11:21,940
there is a guy New York Bob siebert I
think

187
00:11:21,940 --> 00:11:25,610
he likes to say and tell you get the
truth on the table no matter how ugly it

188
00:11:25,610 --> 00:11:28,230
is you can't deal with it

189
00:11:28,230 --> 00:11:34,300
I like to say the truth any cost lowers
all other costs

190
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:37,430
now I don't know how many have you
actually believe the crap andromeda

191
00:11:37,430 --> 00:11:40,470
bomber putting out but the actual
unemployment rate the United States

192
00:11:40,470 --> 00:11:44,260
america's 20 2.4 percent

193
00:11:44,260 --> 00:11:47,850
it's nowhere near eight-percent and we
are losing jobs

194
00:11:47,850 --> 00:11:51,899
every month we are not creating jobs but
the two-party Tierney

195
00:11:51,899 --> 00:11:56,480
it's convenient for Romney did not
challenge Obama on substance

196
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:59,950
because if you get down to the substance
matter if you get down to the subsystem

197
00:11:59,950 --> 00:12:03,570
added the greatest enemy the United
States America today

198
00:12:03,570 --> 00:12:06,980
is the two-parter the Republican Party

199
00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:10,339
and the Democratic Party arm

200
00:12:10,339 --> 00:12:15,220
we can talk about that to my impressions

201
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:19,070
Obama is not a black man he's a white
man in search

202
00:12:19,070 --> 00:12:22,370
of black identity on and

203
00:12:22,370 --> 00:12:25,920
when he appointed rama manuel as chief
of staff

204
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:29,420
I know immediately we were totally
fucked okay

205
00:12:29,420 --> 00:12:33,050
because rama manuel represents Israel he
represents

206
00:12:33,050 --> 00:12:36,070
arm are dark Vader politics

207
00:12:36,070 --> 00:12:39,339
he is the newt Gingrich have the
Democratic Party ok

208
00:12:39,339 --> 00:12:42,660
on Romney

209
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:46,850
there is an awful lot about Romney that
has not been disclosed

210
00:12:46,850 --> 00:12:50,920
and I personally would never consider
Romney is a republican candidate without

211
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:55,750
first seriously investigating both his
ties to Bain Capital and

212
00:12:55,750 --> 00:13:01,050
Israel and his ties to Mexican drug
cartels and wash our money

213
00:13:01,050 --> 00:13:04,680
are I don't think ronnie is qualified to
be President I don't think you'll be a

214
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:05,820
good president

215
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:10,329
and I think that we have an opportunity
believe it or not

216
00:13:10,329 --> 00:13:13,529
between now and the end of September

217
00:13:13,529 --> 00:13:17,579
it actually change this national
conversation to none of the above

218
00:13:17,579 --> 00:13:20,820
I'll and there's nothing more I can do

219
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:25,709
Ron Paul Dennis percentage in their own
little world these guys are fighting for

220
00:13:25,709 --> 00:13:27,310
their share of the pie

221
00:13:27,310 --> 00:13:31,190
in their partner they have zero interest

222
00:13:31,190 --> 00:13:35,480
in actually creating a coalition cabinet
they both refuse

223
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:40,060
an invitation to cosponsor an electoral
reform summit

224
00:13:40,060 --> 00:13:44,760
that could have put the Elector Reform
Act on the table this summer

225
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:49,649
I like rocky Anderson but he's playing
his own game

226
00:13:49,649 --> 00:13:53,110
Gary Johnson Glen Drive my NGB

227
00:13:53,110 --> 00:13:57,699
on buddy roemer one trick pony

228
00:13:57,699 --> 00:14:01,360
taking the money out of politics means
nothing

229
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:05,959
if you don't also have ballot access if
you don't also have a hand counted

230
00:14:05,959 --> 00:14:08,380
ballots at the precinct level

231
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:11,949
k on his campaign finance stuff that's
that's a that's a red herring

232
00:14:11,949 --> 00:14:16,740
that's a distraction it's not serious
buddy robert is not serious and neither

233
00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:18,230
is Gary Johnson

234
00:14:18,230 --> 00:14:21,899
Jill Stein lovely lady deer in the
headlights okay

235
00:14:21,899 --> 00:14:25,220
I mean she means well and I will say
this about the Green Party it is the

236
00:14:25,220 --> 00:14:28,240
only party that actually has a chip
together

237
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:32,320
in terms of having really good idea as
well documented well-thought-out

238
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:35,690
arm my dream would be a coalition
cabinet

239
00:14:35,690 --> 00:14:38,839
starts with the Green Party platform

240
00:14:38,839 --> 00:14:41,880
and moves out into the the reform party

241
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:45,910
are area cynthia mckinney has been
obsessed with Libya

242
00:14:45,910 --> 00:14:52,180
in basically lost the year in Virgil
Goode Constitution Party who

243
00:14:52,180 --> 00:14:55,370
you can't now this is what I've word

244
00:14:55,370 --> 00:14:58,940
and I tell you some I if I remember
professor all my students would run for

245
00:14:58,940 --> 00:14:59,639
president

246
00:14:59,639 --> 00:15:02,800
I'm you learn a lot

247
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:06,360
you really do you have the feeling in
the fingertips

248
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:10,829
there are 8 validated national parties
in the united states America today

249
00:15:10,829 --> 00:15:14,639
Constitution democratic green
libertarian natural or reform

250
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:19,320
Republican socialist natural on social
socialist term our bond right now

251
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:24,399
so turns out that Congress has the power
to mandate

252
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:29,040
that all federal elections at the state
levels include all hate parties on the

253
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:31,279
ballot

254
00:15:31,279 --> 00:15:35,170
congress can mandate that all debates
for federal elections include candidates

255
00:15:35,170 --> 00:15:38,730
from all hate parties are six parties
where everyone there

256
00:15:38,730 --> 00:15:43,329
congress has been given this bill to
pass nine times

257
00:15:43,329 --> 00:15:46,380
the last four by Ron Paul

258
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:49,670
you don't get me wrong I like Ron Paul I
want him to be chief justice to the

259
00:15:49,670 --> 00:15:50,839
supreme court

260
00:15:50,839 --> 00:15:54,009
of but he's not

261
00:15:54,009 --> 00:15:57,750
doesn't play well with others on

262
00:15:57,750 --> 00:16:00,800
so the fact of the matter is we have a
congress is

263
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:04,380
barley corrupted every possible way

264
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:08,930
and don't blame Wall Street it wasn't
Wall Street the bribe congress it was

265
00:16:08,930 --> 00:16:11,870
congress pic shut down Wall Streeter

266
00:16:11,870 --> 00:16:15,339
for blacks and as I ended my

267
00:16:15,339 --> 00:16:18,990
my video that went viral because
somebody else was kind enough to take me

268
00:16:18,990 --> 00:16:22,470
there's nothing wrong with America that
can't be fixed by flushing this congress

269
00:16:22,470 --> 00:16:23,980
down the toilet

270
00:16:23,980 --> 00:16:30,980
okay it's that simple integrity is the
only word that matters

271
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:39,240
now I for got this sorry so I've address
this or move forward

272
00:16:39,730 --> 00:16:43,279
now we're New York Bloomberg hometown

273
00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:47,360
arm the largest secret armed force on a
planet

274
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:53,350
arm outside have selected elements to
the US government

275
00:16:53,350 --> 00:16:57,440
$75 million a year to put people in jail
for marijuana so they can red-lined the

276
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:59,720
districts into a real estate thing

277
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:03,920
on two different things have three
different things have come up with

278
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:05,589
Bloomberg money

279
00:17:05,589 --> 00:17:09,889
more frames a Bloomberg money the first
was independent voting da toward

280
00:17:09,890 --> 00:17:14,459
and initially I had high hopes for them
but now I consider Jackie sale it to be

281
00:17:14,459 --> 00:17:16,850
part of the controlled opposition

282
00:17:16,849 --> 00:17:19,859
they're basically frittering away all
their capital

283
00:17:19,860 --> 00:17:23,860
on little nickel-and-dime thinks and
they're not focusing on the only thing

284
00:17:23,860 --> 00:17:26,569
that really matters which is electoral
reform

285
00:17:26,569 --> 00:17:30,909
and I'll get to that in a second and
then you have no labels I help latham at

286
00:17:30,910 --> 00:17:32,070
existence

287
00:17:32,070 --> 00:17:35,418
twice now they're coming back for a
third time

288
00:17:35,419 --> 00:17:39,799
and they've recently announced that in
January after the election

289
00:17:39,799 --> 00:17:43,000
they are going to have a republican and
a democrat

290
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:47,210
lead them in a national conversation

291
00:17:47,210 --> 00:17:51,140
so I sent a header this thing are a
little email civil partner

292
00:17:51,140 --> 00:17:54,280
the parties are you not understand okay

293
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:59,379
no labels is a fraud I mean it's like
baghdad wag the dog or whatever I mean

294
00:17:59,380 --> 00:18:01,320
even have their own god damn song

295
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:05,600
arm it's a joke it's a fraud it's not
serious

296
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:08,780
and it's not serious because it not only
cannot embrace

297
00:18:08,780 --> 00:18:12,940
all-american not just the two-party
turning it's not serious because it

298
00:18:12,940 --> 00:18:15,330
doesn't have an analytic model

299
00:18:15,330 --> 00:18:19,059
it doesn't have any concept of what a
balanced budget should look like that is

300
00:18:19,059 --> 00:18:20,490
actually pro-people pop

301
00:18:20,490 --> 00:18:24,030
pro patria on and it's basically

302
00:18:24,030 --> 00:18:28,360
money trying to pretend to be democratic
similarly

303
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:34,090
Americans Elect was a really really good
idea

304
00:18:34,090 --> 00:18:37,220
corruptly executed K

305
00:18:37,220 --> 00:18:41,330
actual idea actually brilliance stunning
idea

306
00:18:41,330 --> 00:18:44,470
they made a complete hash out their
website I am

307
00:18:44,470 --> 00:18:49,520
Christine Wagner whatever name is like
seven or eight times violated her signed

308
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:51,309
oath to this organization

309
00:18:51,309 --> 00:18:55,590
and was promoting a.m. a particular
candidate to be the Americans Elect

310
00:18:55,590 --> 00:18:56,270
candidate

311
00:18:56,270 --> 00:19:01,230
buddy roemer has given up on them he's
now Reform Party candidate

312
00:19:01,230 --> 00:19:05,650
Americans Elect is

313
00:19:05,650 --> 00:19:09,890
in my view an attempt for the moneyed
class to

314
00:19:09,890 --> 00:19:14,650
to plan for what comes after Obama
self-destructs home

315
00:19:14,650 --> 00:19:18,220
and I don't think it's been very
effective so now the monies riding on

316
00:19:18,220 --> 00:19:22,590
Romney

317
00:19:22,590 --> 00:19:25,659
now elect to reform as possible

318
00:19:25,660 --> 00:19:29,460
I visited Capitol Hill think it was in
December

319
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:32,630
November

320
00:19:32,630 --> 00:19:36,280
they were terrified

321
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:40,210
because occupy represented an authentic

322
00:19:40,210 --> 00:19:43,840
groundswell think I've the farmers
marching on washington

323
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:47,230
of the whole populist anger occupy was

324
00:19:47,230 --> 00:19:51,860
authentic now occupy has basically been
distracted

325
00:19:51,860 --> 00:19:54,840
two competing for these little ten
thousand dollar twenty-five thousand

326
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:57,959
dollar grants they've been rolled by the
Ford Foundation the Rockefeller

327
00:19:57,960 --> 00:19:59,440
Foundation and so forth

328
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:03,559
in my opinion now one of the cool things
about

329
00:20:03,559 --> 00:20:07,460
sponsoring an elector Reform Act of 2012
which I develop with Jim Turner was

330
00:20:07,460 --> 00:20:08,929
number two for ralph nader

331
00:20:08,929 --> 00:20:12,770
are Jack Gill who was one of president
clinton's communications assistance and

332
00:20:12,770 --> 00:20:14,780
Michael Cuddyer was won a very clear

333
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:19,230
goldwater's campaign senior campaign
people

334
00:20:19,230 --> 00:20:23,220
is it attracted all the stakeholders
across this country

335
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:27,000
who have an interest in electoral reform
on

336
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:30,690
in that was really cool because it was a
form of

337
00:20:30,690 --> 00:20:34,250
old 12 not crowdsourcing exactly but it
was a form of

338
00:20:34,250 --> 00:20:38,220
love build it and they will come and
these are the ten elements

339
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:41,809
their emerge out of this national
conversation

340
00:20:41,809 --> 00:20:45,139
among stakeholders and what I'd like to
see this become

341
00:20:45,140 --> 00:20:48,169
is a national conversation led by Occupy

342
00:20:48,169 --> 00:20:51,220
and the National Cancer for deliberation
and I look

343
00:20:51,220 --> 00:20:54,559
on there is no integrity

344
00:20:54,559 --> 00:20:57,690
in our electoral process the votes

345
00:20:57,690 --> 00:21:01,559
are counted by electronic format a
central level

346
00:21:01,559 --> 00:21:05,370
they have nothing to do with what the
actual votes were at the precinct level

347
00:21:05,370 --> 00:21:10,159
K soul if you don't understand that you
shouldn't be in this room

348
00:21:10,159 --> 00:21:14,600
on number two ballot access

349
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:19,610
ballot access in this country is as
corrupt as any dictatorship on the

350
00:21:19,610 --> 00:21:21,710
planet

351
00:21:21,710 --> 00:21:27,620
and I amazed that people to sit still
for people vote not States

352
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:31,890
are put all initiatives to vote we're
now at a point where the national ballot

353
00:21:31,890 --> 00:21:33,419
initiative should be flying

354
00:21:33,419 --> 00:21:38,020
we should be able to scrutinize all
legislation that's number ten open

355
00:21:38,020 --> 00:21:41,299
legislation no legislation should be
pass it has not been placed before the

356
00:21:41,299 --> 00:21:42,129
public

357
00:21:42,130 --> 00:21:45,929
so you can put a thousand eyeballs on I
mean I love the Linux line

358
00:21:45,929 --> 00:21:48,960
which is put enough eyeballs on it no
bugs invisible well

359
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:52,950
the the other cited that is put enough
eyeballs on it no crime a corruption is

360
00:21:52,950 --> 00:21:54,309
invisible

361
00:21:54,309 --> 00:21:58,309
okay on open debates at all levels

362
00:21:58,309 --> 00:22:01,639
cabinet named in advance and
participating in cabinet level

363
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:05,470
debates at a minimum the attorney
general for the secretary defence and

364
00:22:05,470 --> 00:22:05,940
anime

365
00:22:05,940 --> 00:22:09,320
would have course delete the Department
of Homeland Security

366
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:12,950
which if I were president ron Paul would
be given that job

367
00:22:12,950 --> 00:22:16,470
and then rewarded by being chief justice
to the supreme court which is my revenge

368
00:22:16,470 --> 00:22:17,900
for citizens united

369
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:21,070
on

370
00:22:21,070 --> 00:22:25,770
here's the bottom line: we can still
hold a national electoral reform some in

371
00:22:25,770 --> 00:22:29,750
September and demand the passage to the
electoral reform active 2012

372
00:22:29,750 --> 00:22:33,440
problem is I don't have the voice no one
hears me

373
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:37,700
arm we can still former people's
candidacy i mean

374
00:22:37,700 --> 00:22:42,110
for christ sake if a game controller can
get two million dollars in 24 hours

375
00:22:42,110 --> 00:22:45,860
why the hell can't saving the country

376
00:22:45,860 --> 00:22:49,409
get a billion dollars in 24 hours okay

377
00:22:49,409 --> 00:22:54,299
so I'm a little frustrated arm we can
still occupy the Home Office's

378
00:22:54,299 --> 00:22:57,830
every senator and representative and
force the issue elect to reform in time

379
00:22:57,830 --> 00:22:59,780
for 2012

380
00:22:59,780 --> 00:23:03,740
every single one of these people

381
00:23:03,740 --> 00:23:08,130
is easily influenced if you were in
their face

382
00:23:08,130 --> 00:23:12,740
in their home office in this is the
article and by the way I've posted this

383
00:23:12,740 --> 00:23:15,950
briefing at Phi Beta I owe to the public
intelligence blog

384
00:23:15,950 --> 00:23:20,100
so you can go get the briefing and these
links alive but disappeared in reality

385
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:21,520
sandwich

386
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:26,330
and kinda tells the story now part 2 and
I can see signs how many minutes have

387
00:23:26,330 --> 00:23:28,809
been sweeping

388
00:23:28,809 --> 00:23:33,408
okay our banks battle for the soul
Republic

389
00:23:33,409 --> 00:23:37,700
I finally realized after I read
something by Gary North why

390
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:41,100
Congress passes so many lots

391
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:44,299
that's how it black males business

392
00:23:44,299 --> 00:23:47,830
in other words we've become an
administrative state so that

393
00:23:47,830 --> 00:23:51,629
corporations have to bribe congress to
escape

394
00:23:51,630 --> 00:23:54,990
the administrative regulations the
congress is threatening to impose

395
00:23:54,990 --> 00:23:58,460
K it's an attempt to micromanage
everything

396
00:23:58,460 --> 00:24:02,900
and it's actually totally dysfunctional

397
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:05,980
to integrity has been lost our
government as Holland and don't get me

398
00:24:05,980 --> 00:24:08,130
wrong my wife's the worst the US
government

399
00:24:08,130 --> 00:24:11,510
I work for US government for many years
I consider US government to be good

400
00:24:11,510 --> 00:24:13,850
people trapped in a bad system

401
00:24:13,850 --> 00:24:17,529
and most of them are terrified that the
US companies can collapse

402
00:24:17,529 --> 00:24:20,039
we're gonna have a reduction in force
that they're gonna be out on the street

403
00:24:20,039 --> 00:24:23,100
there are no middle-class jobs anymore
in america

404
00:24:23,100 --> 00:24:26,919
okay the only jobs that are rising up
for our jobs in turn the server level it

405
00:24:26,919 --> 00:24:29,700
at the ten dollar blow range

406
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:33,720
congress is discounting the US Treasury
and barring one trillion dollars year

407
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:35,049
which started under reagan

408
00:24:35,049 --> 00:24:38,510
by the way in nineteen not and 1980

409
00:24:38,510 --> 00:24:42,600
they're doing all of this because they
give out 95 percent of the Treasury

410
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:47,700
in return for a five per cent kickback
that's a standard rate on capital hill

411
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:51,039
5 percent and even though there are
those like Ron Paul

412
00:24:51,039 --> 00:24:55,110
on who who don't take these bribes

413
00:24:55,110 --> 00:24:58,760
everyone has their own thing to hire Ron
Paul does not want you to know

414
00:24:58,760 --> 00:25:03,110
how lucky he is

415
00:25:03,110 --> 00:25:07,380
now this is a documented fact about
waste

416
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:12,309
so I personally believe the time has
come to abolish the existing government

417
00:25:12,309 --> 00:25:16,168
controlled by the two-party Tierney
treason

418
00:25:16,169 --> 00:25:20,409
I firmly believe that the Republican and
Democratic parties are the biggest

419
00:25:20,409 --> 00:25:24,470
enemies on the founding fathers
principles other republican the

420
00:25:24,470 --> 00:25:27,500
constitutional america the beautiful

421
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:32,840
these two parties are the biggest
problem we face not china not

422
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:36,590
russia not poverty not terrorism which
is a joke

423
00:25:36,590 --> 00:25:39,730
back created by CIA thank you very much
on

424
00:25:39,730 --> 00:25:43,140
these are the true evils

425
00:25:43,140 --> 00:25:46,650
that actually undermine everything we
might seek to be ok

426
00:25:46,650 --> 00:25:49,659
now if I were governor I B now a fine of
Federal Regulations

427
00:25:49,659 --> 00:25:52,970
and and and kicking federal government
out at the state

428
00:25:52,970 --> 00:25:56,500
arm because essentially what we have is
a circular

429
00:25:56,500 --> 00:26:01,190
fake money trail that drives the states
to go along with the federal government

430
00:26:01,190 --> 00:26:05,340
I think every state needs to be building
toward resilience from the county level

431
00:26:05,340 --> 00:26:10,570
on up now I certainly recommend occur
Patrick sales book human scale

432
00:26:10,570 --> 00:26:15,658
and John robs block I so the bottom line
here is when I miss akers we might think

433
00:26:15,659 --> 00:26:19,600
america the beautiful is rich beyond
measure

434
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:22,809
but we were in common crops run this
country

435
00:26:22,809 --> 00:26:26,350
this is nuts so here's the reference on
this one

436
00:26:26,350 --> 00:26:30,510
reality sandwich enable and now for the
last third part

437
00:26:30,510 --> 00:26:36,110
quickly I started out as a champion for
open source intelligence

438
00:26:36,110 --> 00:26:39,830
and my original schlicht was on a spy
who says buying doesn't work don't send

439
00:26:39,830 --> 00:26:41,908
Aspirus schoolboy can go

440
00:26:41,909 --> 00:26:45,460
well it turns out the reason the secret
intelligence community doesn't want to

441
00:26:45,460 --> 00:26:47,120
hear what i'm saying

442
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:50,370
is because there is a normal profit

443
00:26:50,370 --> 00:26:55,210
in secret waste and because its secret
they're not held accountable

444
00:26:55,210 --> 00:26:59,409
for this secret waste virtually every
major program

445
00:26:59,409 --> 00:27:03,789
for NSA CIA the entire older National
Geospatial agency which tends to be a

446
00:27:03,789 --> 00:27:04,640
little bit better

447
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:10,190
draw failures I mean SAIC's trailblazer
for NSA absolute failure but the problem

448
00:27:10,190 --> 00:27:10,730
is

449
00:27:10,730 --> 00:27:14,400
but I people realize it's a failure the
government people responsible for the

450
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:16,039
bad decisions have retired

451
00:27:16,039 --> 00:27:20,220
into a cushy second job and the
contractors who flipped

452
00:27:20,220 --> 00:27:25,020
goes like this: this constant chatter

453
00:27:25,020 --> 00:27:28,450
the Grade Book Collective Intelligence
creating a prosperous world peace edited

454
00:27:28,450 --> 00:27:29,289
by Marco V

455
00:27:29,289 --> 00:27:35,059
Burning Man open BTS provided free cell
phone access the everybody a burning Man

456
00:27:35,059 --> 00:27:40,149
using open BTS and range networks is now
starting to think about how they get

457
00:27:40,149 --> 00:27:42,289
open BTS out $2.5 billion poor

458
00:27:42,289 --> 00:27:45,990
with a cross dove less than two dollars
a month

459
00:27:45,990 --> 00:27:50,710
for cellular service in the third world
on and then I've written a book

460
00:27:50,710 --> 00:27:54,510
here it is in and I didn't bring any to
sell I hope your buyer

461
00:27:54,510 --> 00:27:58,539
if you wanna hack Amazon it was in the
top 100 for democracy the first three

462
00:27:58,539 --> 00:28:02,270
weeks it was out now its nose dived it's
down in like five hundred thousand

463
00:28:02,270 --> 00:28:06,039
so it ten dollars it's a good buy are
it's available in Kindle

464
00:28:06,039 --> 00:28:11,360
and what I say here is what the world
lacks right now especially the United

465
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:14,570
States were every former organization
from government to banks the labor

466
00:28:14,570 --> 00:28:16,450
unions has betrayed the public trust

467
00:28:16,450 --> 00:28:20,899
is integrity also lacking is public
intelligence in the sensor decision

468
00:28:20,899 --> 00:28:21,480
support

469
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:25,210
knowing what one needs to know in order
to make honest decisions for the good of

470
00:28:25,210 --> 00:28:26,299
all

471
00:28:26,299 --> 00:28:29,510
on we've become a stupid country not you
guys

472
00:28:29,510 --> 00:28:32,990
you're the exception but we've become
stupid are

473
00:28:32,990 --> 00:28:36,779
and corrupted lazy and fat and an and
I'm fat

474
00:28:36,779 --> 00:28:41,409
I gave up drinking but I cannot give up
I can't ask armor

475
00:28:41,409 --> 00:28:44,470
I have to drop a line someplace this is
a

476
00:28:44,470 --> 00:28:48,409
II credit this someone else started this
and meet Michael balance for p2p

477
00:28:48,409 --> 00:28:49,390
foundation

478
00:28:49,390 --> 00:28:52,490
but this is the open everything pair
minutes not original to me there's

479
00:28:52,490 --> 00:28:55,140
another guy that they created it and
he's credited in a

480
00:28:55,140 --> 00:28:59,230
in the notes this is Mike or vision

481
00:28:59,230 --> 00:29:04,840
I believe the open source software are
open spectrum open hardware open data

482
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:06,559
access open standards

483
00:29:06,559 --> 00:29:10,399
open source intelligence with open BTS
an open money

484
00:29:10,399 --> 00:29:15,330
I think that's weird that's where the
the this seed crystal is

485
00:29:15,330 --> 00:29:19,610
and it all leads towards resilience

486
00:29:19,610 --> 00:29:24,690
humans are router on the last slide you
can see where technology is going to

487
00:29:24,690 --> 00:29:26,570
mean you can see where humans are
greater

488
00:29:26,570 --> 00:29:30,460
and over here a book that is still
priceless radical man

489
00:29:30,460 --> 00:29:34,549
from the 1980s humanity

490
00:29:34,549 --> 00:29:40,799
is the wild card the one inexhaustible
resource we have is human ingenuity

491
00:29:40,799 --> 00:29:44,629
but we spent the last 15 years trying to
beat kids in the submission

492
00:29:44,630 --> 00:29:48,210
tell you sit still for 18 years arm

493
00:29:48,210 --> 00:29:53,159
it's nuts I mean those of us who
survived the US educational system

494
00:29:53,159 --> 00:29:57,260
are the exception this is my vision of

495
00:29:57,260 --> 00:30:01,289
up we're going on we're actually going
back is a great book of $14.91 we're

496
00:30:01,289 --> 00:30:02,158
going back to

497
00:30:02,159 --> 00:30:06,149
before christopher Columbus arm

498
00:30:06,149 --> 00:30:09,279
experts don't know anything they're just

499
00:30:09,279 --> 00:30:13,649
a fraud and I love David Weinberg his
new book too big to now

500
00:30:13,649 --> 00:30:17,429
because he points out that in a rueful
max which the only expert is a room

501
00:30:17,429 --> 00:30:21,320
okay it's very important insight on

502
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:24,559
eight communities have talked about this

503
00:30:24,559 --> 00:30:27,730
there is no information initiatives is
serious

504
00:30:27,730 --> 00:30:30,950
if it cannot bring together all the
information from all

505
00:30:30,950 --> 00:30:37,110
eight communities on that particular
topic as well as all related topics

506
00:30:37,110 --> 00:30:40,669
in a look at this one another time
basically most in the world is stuck in

507
00:30:40,669 --> 00:30:42,130
Quadrant one

508
00:30:42,130 --> 00:30:45,669
Tom I don't like Twitter I'll take
questions

509
00:30:45,669 --> 00:30:49,520
arm in nobody's really doing their
homework

510
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:53,250
and nobody has a memory I mean

511
00:30:53,250 --> 00:30:57,169
it blows my mind the New York Times Sox
are

512
00:30:57,169 --> 00:31:01,070
it's just astonishing to me that we have
reporters even though I know the

513
00:31:01,070 --> 00:31:03,220
reporters are just a little news hole

514
00:31:03,220 --> 00:31:07,269
for dying industry home we have
reporters in actually don't know

515
00:31:07,269 --> 00:31:08,090
anything

516
00:31:08,090 --> 00:31:12,460
more than five years old a home that's
truly frightening

517
00:31:12,460 --> 00:31:18,390
arm this is our world today this is
actually a citation analytic master

518
00:31:18,390 --> 00:31:22,789
up the sciences manage shows how
fragmented all these disciplines have

519
00:31:22,789 --> 00:31:23,440
become

520
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:29,620
to the point that you know we have PHD's
at know everything about nothing

521
00:31:29,620 --> 00:31:33,070
and then you have this other thing here
integral consciousness

522
00:31:33,070 --> 00:31:36,960
which is mom fine now this isn't like
this is my favorite slide for the last

523
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:38,990
ten years

524
00:31:38,990 --> 00:31:43,940
most governments are down in this lower
corner spies in secrecy focused on

525
00:31:43,940 --> 00:31:45,799
interstate conflict

526
00:31:45,799 --> 00:31:48,789
and now they've got this proliferation
and terrorism and crime and those are

527
00:31:48,789 --> 00:31:49,620
the boogeyman

528
00:31:49,620 --> 00:31:53,169
so the bill keep letting the government
do seriously stupid bullshit

529
00:31:53,169 --> 00:31:56,600
on and then as you mature

530
00:31:56,600 --> 00:32:00,890
in your target in your sources and
methods you eventually get out to

531
00:32:00,890 --> 00:32:04,409
open source intelligence multinational
information-sharing

532
00:32:04,409 --> 00:32:08,950
a whirl brain in which all of us are
nodes on n you actually focused on what

533
00:32:08,950 --> 00:32:09,980
really matters

534
00:32:09,980 --> 00:32:14,179
poverty does more damage the environment
all corporations on a platter

535
00:32:14,179 --> 00:32:18,070
okay so poverty infectious disease and
environmental degradation these are the

536
00:32:18,070 --> 00:32:19,340
serious ones

537
00:32:19,340 --> 00:32:23,140
the US government is not serious about
what really matters

538
00:32:23,140 --> 00:32:26,240
in I don't know what to do better

539
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:30,059
I think we can get to parody I think we
can get to where every single one of us

540
00:32:30,059 --> 00:32:31,600
can create our own budget

541
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:36,200
each level and all we have to do is
identify ourselves by zip code and and

542
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:39,210
them and preferred party and then all
that comes out in the wash in

543
00:32:39,210 --> 00:32:42,210
then you have actual Jan you 1
discussions

544
00:32:42,210 --> 00:32:47,070
fact based evidence-based policy
discussions

545
00:32:47,070 --> 00:32:50,070
so the bottom line here not coming to my
clothes is

546
00:32:50,070 --> 00:32:55,129
organize people can indeed triumph over
organize money

547
00:32:55,130 --> 00:32:58,960
and I like to reassure I don't think I
have any wealthy friends actually

548
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:03,220
on but I like to reassure the wealthy
their three thousand millionaires the

549
00:33:03,220 --> 00:33:06,419
ice a sitter terrified that we're gonna
dismember their kids and violate their

550
00:33:06,419 --> 00:33:07,019
wives

551
00:33:07,019 --> 00:33:11,470
arm and I don't think that's the case

552
00:33:11,470 --> 00:33:15,340
there isn't enough money on the planet
to warm confiscation redistribution

553
00:33:15,340 --> 00:33:19,769
we have to dig ourselves out of this
hole by creating infinite wealth by

554
00:33:19,769 --> 00:33:23,409
empowering the five billion porn I just
read

555
00:33:23,409 --> 00:33:26,450
sailors book mobile whatever in

556
00:33:26,450 --> 00:33:30,260
I gave it four stars it wasn't written
by him in it it's kind of a comic

557
00:33:30,260 --> 00:33:31,519
classic comic book

558
00:33:31,519 --> 00:33:34,549
version ok up important stuff

559
00:33:34,549 --> 00:33:38,610
arm but if we can empower $2.5 billion
poor

560
00:33:38,610 --> 00:33:43,049
we can create infinite well we can we
can change the rules of the game we can

561
00:33:43,049 --> 00:33:45,620
change all the market place's by
revealing to

562
00:33:45,620 --> 00:33:49,899
true costs I mean most that you probably
know a gallon of gas across four dollars

563
00:33:49,899 --> 00:33:53,159
actually has twelve dollars an external
ice costs

564
00:33:53,159 --> 00:33:57,730
to the current and future public's and
in truth and reconciliation not just us

565
00:33:57,730 --> 00:34:01,769
we need to go toward is a great book the
time at the introduced me to call 9-0

566
00:34:01,769 --> 00:34:02,340
win when

567
00:34:02,340 --> 00:34:07,029
to open everything and these are the
references

568
00:34:07,029 --> 00:34:10,889
I wrote this book in nineteen in 2008
its free online

569
00:34:10,889 --> 00:34:16,070
arm I Nalder I can't get anybody to read
the book

570
00:34:16,070 --> 00:34:21,030
are so I'm a failure I have not been
able to communicate what I think

571
00:34:21,030 --> 00:34:28,030
is obvious common sense truth now this
is my proposed answer

572
00:34:31,129 --> 00:34:38,129
and that's it I'll take questions

573
00:34:44,549 --> 00:34:45,230
on

574
00:34:45,230 --> 00:34:48,418
I'm answer I probably should've just
need you

575
00:34:48,418 --> 00:34:53,598
earlier but I was on an STD cell am
about a big boobs it's the

576
00:34:53,599 --> 00:34:57,520
hmm let's who you will be here is really
a

577
00:34:57,520 --> 00:35:01,210
I don't wanna make assumptions about the
racial identity and I guess you identify

578
00:35:01,210 --> 00:35:02,190
is why he

579
00:35:02,190 --> 00:35:07,609
a fastening this year's ban it I was
meant to do and frankly I don't think I

580
00:35:07,609 --> 00:35:09,170
have the right eye and ear Bay

581
00:35:09,170 --> 00:35:12,770
you know to say that a black Obama's not
black

582
00:35:12,770 --> 00:35:17,119
is really just an on-demand really had
my

583
00:35:17,119 --> 00:35:20,470
actually research this you he okay
that's great

584
00:35:20,470 --> 00:35:25,160
arson conspiracy babe and miss also the
centre nad

585
00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:28,578
closed-in lovely lady but I D and the
headline it's

586
00:35:28,579 --> 00:35:31,740
I mean you said so many things that I
really agree with

587
00:35:31,740 --> 00:35:36,059
bread bed crappy things that you said
Justin Bieber showed up so

588
00:35:36,059 --> 00:35:39,880
just had to stick around as a man thank
you very much arm

589
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:43,079
Barack Obama has been in search of his
black identity

590
00:35:43,079 --> 00:35:48,390
ever since as columbia days on and and
being handled by zbigniew brzezinski

591
00:35:48,390 --> 00:35:53,980
the wine

592
00:35:53,980 --> 00:35:59,299
authentic moment in Barack Obama's
presidential candidacy was seen when he

593
00:35:59,299 --> 00:36:02,700
said he could no more renounce reverend
right that he could renounces on mother

594
00:36:02,700 --> 00:36:08,440
that was authentic after that he sold
out he's still got three hundred million

595
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:10,470
dollars that are not accounted for

596
00:36:10,470 --> 00:36:14,510
a good portion of which come from
sovereign defense sovereign funds

597
00:36:14,510 --> 00:36:18,920
are and I'm not trashing Obama as an
individual but rather as a puppet

598
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:24,230
arm the bottom line here is he's done
nothing that seriously good for america

599
00:36:24,230 --> 00:36:28,089
and neither has any of the other
candidates going back to Kennedy who was

600
00:36:28,089 --> 00:36:28,950
assassinated

601
00:36:28,950 --> 00:36:32,480
for wanting to do good things for
america so I'll take questions

602
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:37,520
and and also I will be here on Saturday
night and I realize that I say crappy

603
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:38,079
things

604
00:36:38,079 --> 00:36:43,660
and its perhaps a flaw perhaps a feature

605
00:36:43,660 --> 00:36:47,058
but the subtitle love my last book
before this one was

606
00:36:47,059 --> 00:36:51,160
clarity diversity integrity in
sustainability if you can have a

607
00:36:51,160 --> 00:36:54,950
conversation if you can't get the facts
on the table if you are so hell-bent on

608
00:36:54,950 --> 00:36:55,319
your

609
00:36:55,319 --> 00:36:59,299
racial or gender whatever other identity
then you're not much use to the

610
00:36:59,299 --> 00:37:00,339
conversation

611
00:37:00,339 --> 00:37:04,299
are and that said sorry about that as we
use the same vietnam

612
00:37:04,299 --> 00:37:07,430
yessir i rabbit I'm a big fan of the
book

613
00:37:07,430 --> 00:37:10,859
on by Gene Sharp from dictatorship to
democracy

614
00:37:10,859 --> 00:37:14,578
as one who could go back and talk a
little bit about or WS

615
00:37:14,579 --> 00:37:18,059
and whatcha gonna take to get these
people to move to appoint

616
00:37:18,059 --> 00:37:21,250
but we have our judicial invalidation

617
00:37:21,250 --> 00:37:24,520
runway grand juries and some real
meaningful change

618
00:37:24,520 --> 00:37:30,180
well I it's a it's a great question on I
mean I had so much hope for Occupy

619
00:37:30,180 --> 00:37:34,720
and and I was so excited up by the
possibilities

620
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:41,200
I think we're at a point I did my first
thesis on predicting revolution in 1976

621
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:42,480
and you can find

622
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:45,619
my chart love revolutionary
preconditions in the US

623
00:37:45,619 --> 00:37:49,750
we're in very much in a stadium
pre-revolutionary United States America

624
00:37:49,750 --> 00:37:52,650
I mean all we're missing is a soccer mom
burning yourself to death

625
00:37:52,650 --> 00:37:55,720
on the steps Capitol Hill okay that will
do it

626
00:37:55,720 --> 00:37:58,789
many soccer moms in here are

627
00:37:58,789 --> 00:38:03,809
now I mean that will do it okay we had a
veteran burned himself to death

628
00:38:03,809 --> 00:38:07,799
on the steps of the court in New
Hampshire it was hushed up K

629
00:38:07,799 --> 00:38:11,490
it did make the media and a tiny tiny
little way but we're this close

630
00:38:11,490 --> 00:38:16,420
to some catalytic moment that all the
sudden the country says whoa wait a

631
00:38:16,420 --> 00:38:16,900
minute

632
00:38:16,900 --> 00:38:20,640
neither Obama nor Romney let's revisit
this whole thing

633
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:25,980
arm and so I think at this point all I
can do is put my thoughts and the

634
00:38:25,980 --> 00:38:29,250
thoughts of others that I have distilled
collated and put out there

635
00:38:29,250 --> 00:38:32,500
a big bat USA .org and hope

636
00:38:32,500 --> 00:38:36,940
dead and i cant say ross perot I mean
ross perot

637
00:38:36,940 --> 00:38:40,180
had his own demons on

638
00:38:40,180 --> 00:38:43,529
and as a result we we we lost a chance
there

639
00:38:43,529 --> 00:38:46,549
are we have to get away from this whole
electoral

640
00:38:46,549 --> 00:38:51,160
bullshit stuff are because it's all its
of right so I personally think that

641
00:38:51,160 --> 00:38:54,500
occupying the officers are the senators
in a representatives

642
00:38:54,500 --> 00:38:59,000
and demanding electoral reform active
2012 is the only thing that can lead to

643
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:00,930
a nonviolent revolution

644
00:39:00,930 --> 00:39:04,098
but I don't know of anyone agrees with
me on that

645
00:39:04,099 --> 00:39:07,529
question sir about ten years ago the

646
00:39:07,529 --> 00:39:10,619
Texas Libertarian Party game fall ballot
access

647
00:39:10,619 --> 00:39:13,710
good united and we run like 200
candidates

648
00:39:13,710 --> 00:39:17,440
the election cycle but our big problem
right now is

649
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:21,170
like locally we recruit candidates every
time we get some it makes a mark like

650
00:39:21,170 --> 00:39:23,220
ballet you know they they take polling
in

651
00:39:23,220 --> 00:39:26,440
every time they Polak 30 percent or 20
percent

652
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:30,470
though big-money the big organ as money
comes in and you get guys calling you

653
00:39:30,470 --> 00:39:33,119
like lawyers in a straight offer you
jobs

654
00:39:33,119 --> 00:39:36,609
to basically drop out of the race track
the problem is how can you

655
00:39:36,609 --> 00:39:40,230
I'm and do you think a way how can you
recruit people and let him know upstart

656
00:39:40,230 --> 00:39:40,770
this

657
00:39:40,770 --> 00:39:44,559
at front this gonna happen there to find
out how much money you owe like your day

658
00:39:44,559 --> 00:39:45,589
at your house

659
00:39:45,589 --> 00:39:49,460
and they will just just flat out of you
that money how can recruit people that

660
00:39:49,460 --> 00:39:49,890
many

661
00:39:49,890 --> 00:39:52,990
I'm II before when reform I was
libertarian

662
00:39:52,990 --> 00:39:57,049
in in fact it was here at hackers on
planet Earth in the nineteen nineties it

663
00:39:57,049 --> 00:40:00,130
some nice young lady got me to take the
libertarian test

664
00:40:00,130 --> 00:40:03,180
and I realize that was a closet
libertarian arm

665
00:40:03,180 --> 00:40:06,930
then it had a good influence on me arm
me

666
00:40:06,930 --> 00:40:10,180
the the you know

667
00:40:10,180 --> 00:40:13,839
ok this this this all or nothing kind of

668
00:40:13,839 --> 00:40:16,890
being going on here and no one thing

669
00:40:16,890 --> 00:40:20,140
is going to fix it taking money out of
politics won't fix it because the

670
00:40:20,140 --> 00:40:23,230
secretaries of state across this country
are all corrupt

671
00:40:23,230 --> 00:40:26,970
arm getting DeBolt put out a business

672
00:40:26,970 --> 00:40:29,880
will not quite fix it because then
you've got all these issues have

673
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:32,220
infrastructure organisation and so forth

674
00:40:32,220 --> 00:40:37,119
so I honestly cannot tell you I know the
answer are all I do know is that what

675
00:40:37,119 --> 00:40:38,799
we're doing now is not work

676
00:40:38,799 --> 00:40:45,670
are and I really wanted Ron Paul and
Dennis Kucinich to come together

677
00:40:45,670 --> 00:40:49,069
and form a coalition cabinet and a
balanced budget and demand electoral

678
00:40:49,069 --> 00:40:50,299
reform

679
00:40:50,299 --> 00:40:53,930
those are the only two guys the United
States of America

680
00:40:53,930 --> 00:40:57,200
who actually have the power to do that
and I consider them traitors because

681
00:40:57,200 --> 00:40:58,869
they refused to do it

682
00:40:58,869 --> 00:41:02,930
okay so please forgive me I love Ron
Paul I want to be chief justice

683
00:41:02,930 --> 00:41:06,210
report but until he's willing to put his
ass on the line

684
00:41:06,210 --> 00:41:11,289
and leave the republican party and lead
all of us

685
00:41:11,289 --> 00:41:14,549
yes hell yet there you go

686
00:41:14,549 --> 00:41:19,190
Ron Paul Ron Paul was bought out you
have it from Texas

687
00:41:19,190 --> 00:41:23,900
lead

688
00:41:23,900 --> 00:41:28,200
there's a there's a strong secessionist
movement are in vermont

689
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:32,200
and I think Texas alaska and I am

690
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:36,190
I think Texas in alaska basically

691
00:41:36,190 --> 00:41:40,720
I think the state's have to start
seriously questioning

692
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:44,480
whether the federal government is worth
the price that we're all paying

693
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:49,440
in about talking about small government
or stop wars overseas or whatever

694
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:53,520
i'm talking about the fact that we have
a system that has substituted ideology

695
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:55,460
for intelligence and corruption for

696
00:41:55,460 --> 00:41:59,660
integrity the US government is broken

697
00:41:59,660 --> 00:42:03,359
good people trapped in a bad system so I
don't know what the answer is I'm

698
00:42:03,359 --> 00:42:06,440
maybe it's an Arab Spring kinda thing
maybe there's a soccer mom burning

699
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:07,520
yourself to death

700
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:11,079
on the steps to capitol hill this
country needs a wake-up call

701
00:42:11,079 --> 00:42:14,630
we've got 75,000 amputees across this
country

702
00:42:14,630 --> 00:42:19,710
nobody knows that we have over 500,000
disabled veterans from both want of to

703
00:42:19,710 --> 00:42:20,619
because we

704
00:42:20,619 --> 00:42:23,650
has ever had seen the pollution babies
pictures

705
00:42:23,650 --> 00:42:27,000
I mean we've been using depleted uranium
and stuff from returning out little

706
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:30,880
alien children in iraq it is truly

707
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:35,069
stashing to me that the world lets us
get away with that stuff

708
00:42:35,069 --> 00:42:38,630
sop I love america the beautiful but
right now we are not

709
00:42:38,630 --> 00:42:41,779
well-represented yessir

710
00:42:41,779 --> 00:42:45,270
yes someone in other countries are
boating is

711
00:42:45,270 --> 00:42:49,609
the our requirement are punishable by
fines had what's your opinion on that

712
00:42:49,609 --> 00:42:50,578
and

713
00:42:50,579 --> 00:42:53,770
like to followed up with on terms the
occupying the

714
00:42:53,770 --> 00:42:57,170
are congressional offices I think we all
know that

715
00:42:57,170 --> 00:43:01,000
they're controlled by the monied
interests so should we go to the source

716
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:02,849
the problem in Occupy

717
00:43:02,849 --> 00:43:06,779
you know you know and well thing about
the Occupy movement I think it was a red

718
00:43:06,779 --> 00:43:07,920
herring because people

719
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:11,420
the money behind occupy yeah the
contractors and and others said tea

720
00:43:11,420 --> 00:43:11,989
party

721
00:43:11,989 --> 00:43:14,989
well first off I don't think anyone
should be forced to do anything

722
00:43:14,989 --> 00:43:18,140
arm including voting

723
00:43:18,140 --> 00:43:23,089
a there's a wonderful book by Will
Durant it is 1916 doctoral thesis

724
00:43:23,089 --> 00:43:26,759
and it's been published republish
recently as philosophy in the social

725
00:43:26,759 --> 00:43:27,489
problem

726
00:43:27,489 --> 00:43:30,910
the annotated edition and I any book I
refer to

727
00:43:30,910 --> 00:43:35,808
I've put the cliff notes on Amazon okay
so any book I refer to you can look up

728
00:43:35,809 --> 00:43:38,000
my review and get a summary of the book

729
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:41,239
arm what this boils down to

730
00:43:41,239 --> 00:43:45,670
is an educated public is the only way
you can have a democracy

731
00:43:45,670 --> 00:43:49,040
and in the nineteen twenties Rockefeller
and Carnegie got together and agreed

732
00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:51,930
that they were going to create factory
schools

733
00:43:51,930 --> 00:43:55,379
and they were going to kill public
transportation and they did that they

734
00:43:55,380 --> 00:43:57,099
bought up all the public transportation

735
00:43:57,099 --> 00:44:00,400
companies to put him on a business and
they pushed America toward the suburban

736
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:01,660
sprawl staff

737
00:44:01,660 --> 00:44:06,118
are and at the same time they created
schools it that created factory workers

738
00:44:06,119 --> 00:44:09,790
you know arm soul

739
00:44:09,790 --> 00:44:14,200
education is number one and I'm excited
I mean one

740
00:44:14,200 --> 00:44:17,720
good thing about sailors book I like
michael c only spoken I summon up on

741
00:44:17,720 --> 00:44:18,989
Amazon

742
00:44:18,989 --> 00:44:22,259
I did this last night actually arm

743
00:44:22,259 --> 00:44:25,609
we're now getting to the point where
people can not only get a free education

744
00:44:25,609 --> 00:44:27,660
online they can also get credentialed

745
00:44:27,660 --> 00:44:30,700
and and we're moving in that direction
very quickly in my dream is

746
00:44:30,700 --> 00:44:34,290
is educating the five billion poor one
cell call at the time

747
00:44:34,290 --> 00:44:39,380
so I think public education is is is the
is the absolute beginning at this

748
00:44:39,380 --> 00:44:42,920
now as far as occupying the the Senate
and House

749
00:44:42,920 --> 00:44:46,630
offices ok I personally think

750
00:44:46,630 --> 00:44:49,720
that being a representative should be
like jury duty

751
00:44:49,720 --> 00:44:54,980
where its random because anyone have you
would be a better representative

752
00:44:54,980 --> 00:44:59,069
than anybody we have in congress today
as long as you maintain your integrity

753
00:44:59,069 --> 00:45:01,239
and you knew you only have one term

754
00:45:01,239 --> 00:45:05,670
arm so we've we've just created a system
that perpetuates itself

755
00:45:05,670 --> 00:45:09,759
arm and you have a follow up for
anything

756
00:45:09,759 --> 00:45:12,779
sorry have my boss the bubble yes our
next

757
00:45:12,779 --> 00:45:17,349
arm hi I for South I just wanna say that
a think their first congress

758
00:45:17,349 --> 00:45:21,079
track that was kinda align arm but

759
00:45:21,079 --> 00:45:24,960
are onto the substance you seem to be
making

760
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:28,239
om serve collection into different
points

761
00:45:28,239 --> 00:45:31,410
one is you have specific sorta partisan

762
00:45:31,410 --> 00:45:36,200
or are ideological things that you do
you think need to be done

763
00:45:36,200 --> 00:45:40,420
and another is that you're pointing out
problems systemically

764
00:45:40,420 --> 00:45:44,059
I with third-party party access with
open

765
00:45:44,059 --> 00:45:48,569
I access and things like that arm I
believe I have a answer to the latter

766
00:45:48,569 --> 00:45:49,400
part time

767
00:45:49,400 --> 00:45:52,880
nonpartisan so I don't want to comment
on the former

768
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:56,700
I I thought I was arm but

769
00:45:56,700 --> 00:46:01,369
up that's actually the subject might
Hockessin come to it 8 p.m. and on

770
00:46:01,369 --> 00:46:04,880
arm and I am

771
00:46:04,880 --> 00:46:09,690
curious what you think the ends you you
mentioned Vermont in particular

772
00:46:09,690 --> 00:46:13,250
arm and there there's a guy named Jeremy
Hanson

773
00:46:13,250 --> 00:46:18,109
running for state Senate I his platform
is direct democracy

774
00:46:18,109 --> 00:46:21,410
%ah which is partially the subject my
talk but are

775
00:46:21,410 --> 00:46:24,779
his ideas basically his constituents
will

776
00:46:24,779 --> 00:46:28,109
dictate to him what he votes on

777
00:46:28,109 --> 00:46:31,239
what do you think of that and what do
you think the distinction making

778
00:46:31,239 --> 00:46:35,890
between your systemic sorta structural
issues

779
00:46:35,890 --> 00:46:39,410
and the specific things that you think
should be passed well I certainly don't

780
00:46:39,410 --> 00:46:41,259
think of myself as partisan

781
00:46:41,259 --> 00:46:44,660
arm the whole point of a coalition
cabinet

782
00:46:44,660 --> 00:46:48,558
are and declaring a balanced budget in
advance of Election oh by the way

783
00:46:48,559 --> 00:46:50,190
eliminating all taxes

784
00:46:50,190 --> 00:46:54,250
and replacing them with the automated
payment transaction tax

785
00:46:54,250 --> 00:46:58,670
which is a tiny tax I just want to point
out that specific policy

786
00:46:58,670 --> 00:47:02,799
is an ideological statement it's not
like it's not a non-partisan all right

787
00:47:02,799 --> 00:47:03,380
thank you

788
00:47:03,380 --> 00:47:08,059
let me move on arm the automated payment
transaction tax is a tiny tax on

789
00:47:08,059 --> 00:47:11,369
everything and most importantly it's a
tiny tax on all stock and currency

790
00:47:11,369 --> 00:47:13,430
transactions

791
00:47:13,430 --> 00:47:16,288
and it basically doubles the amount of
money that's available while reducing

792
00:47:16,289 --> 00:47:18,579
the average family down the hundreds

793
00:47:18,579 --> 00:47:22,059
in terms of taxes actually paid arm

794
00:47:22,059 --> 00:47:25,609
there is no lack up good common sense
ideas

795
00:47:25,609 --> 00:47:28,730
in this country are what is lacking

796
00:47:28,730 --> 00:47:33,369
is the public conversation and the
integrity in the public intelligence

797
00:47:33,369 --> 00:47:37,220
to actually demand that we be
represented properly

798
00:47:37,220 --> 00:47:41,059
arm so from my point of view are

799
00:47:41,059 --> 00:47:46,700
not partisanship means we have to get
away from this two-party Tierney

800
00:47:46,700 --> 00:47:49,900
because that's what it is Teresa model
wrote a wonderful book %ah grand

801
00:47:49,900 --> 00:47:50,910
illusion

802
00:47:50,910 --> 00:47:55,430
arm and I recommend it highly we have a
two-party turning I mean ronald reagan

803
00:47:55,430 --> 00:47:57,730
made the job written by peggy noonan

804
00:47:57,730 --> 00:48:01,569
the US Congress has less turnover than
the Soviet Politburo had

805
00:48:01,569 --> 00:48:06,288
because they're buying in everyone comes
out a millionaire after one or two terms

806
00:48:06,289 --> 00:48:10,890
on 2 I'm not partisan and I don't think
these ideas are partisan

807
00:48:10,890 --> 00:48:13,970
as far as a systemic stuff goes

808
00:48:13,970 --> 00:48:17,770
we're pretty close I think to wear
handheld devices

809
00:48:17,770 --> 00:48:21,180
will allow for true cost information to
get out there

810
00:48:21,180 --> 00:48:26,109
and I believe we're getting closer to
where at least the one billion rich

811
00:48:26,109 --> 00:48:29,160
will be able to start voting with their
pocketbooks

812
00:48:29,160 --> 00:48:32,299
and and by cutting Jim Turner sturm

813
00:48:32,299 --> 00:48:35,839
I mean I love this wired article which
said you point your cell phone at

814
00:48:35,839 --> 00:48:37,819
something says if you email kill you

815
00:48:37,819 --> 00:48:41,730
arm that's good I mean we're getting
there we're getting to the point where

816
00:48:41,730 --> 00:48:45,759
with especially with ipv6 were getting
the point where all things

817
00:48:45,759 --> 00:48:49,009
can tell us the province their entire
supply chain

818
00:48:49,009 --> 00:48:52,140
how much child labor how much water arm

819
00:48:52,140 --> 00:48:56,480
jay-z lesko its did a thing on on
T-shirts okay an average teacher has

820
00:48:56,480 --> 00:48:58,619
like 500 gallons water

821
00:48:58,619 --> 00:49:02,390
and has child labor in it has tax
avoidance in it and it has all kinds of

822
00:49:02,390 --> 00:49:03,578
different toxins

823
00:49:03,579 --> 00:49:06,579
all along the way and that kinda
knowledge

824
00:49:06,579 --> 00:49:11,220
is not at your fingertips and the key
point that sailor was making in his book

825
00:49:11,220 --> 00:49:12,739
is that the handheld

826
00:49:12,739 --> 00:49:16,980
ap machine rather than the cell phone is
something that can now bring this kinda

827
00:49:16,980 --> 00:49:18,809
knowledge to your fingertips

828
00:49:18,809 --> 00:49:23,390
and so we need a nap basically that
allows any barcode to give you the true

829
00:49:23,390 --> 00:49:26,680
cost have any product and it's going to
take five or six years

830
00:49:26,680 --> 00:49:30,669
but but we're getting there as far as
for Marco's

831
00:49:30,670 --> 00:49:33,980
I believe or Mon is the best hope with
nation

832
00:49:33,980 --> 00:49:37,150
in the sense that we have to have arm

833
00:49:37,150 --> 00:49:40,609
we have to have I am

834
00:49:40,609 --> 00:49:43,960
we have to have bottom up resilience

835
00:49:43,960 --> 00:49:47,829
and we have to have counties and states

836
00:49:47,829 --> 00:49:52,420
that say no to mega agriculture that
begin this curb in farming

837
00:49:52,420 --> 00:49:56,210
that begin to say no to absentee
landlords

838
00:49:56,210 --> 00:49:59,329
mean I love eminent domain

839
00:49:59,329 --> 00:50:03,609
if if we're community and there's an
absentee landlord

840
00:50:03,609 --> 00:50:08,279
goodbye asshole I mean in France think
about 100 year leases

841
00:50:08,279 --> 00:50:11,349
okay basically the land is still on but
the community

842
00:50:11,349 --> 00:50:15,369
but you have a hundred year lease I i
think we don't lack for good ideas

843
00:50:15,369 --> 00:50:19,109
we lack 4 that burning soccer mom

844
00:50:19,109 --> 00:50:23,119
to actually get us all but to the point
where we're willing to say he'd now wait

845
00:50:23,119 --> 00:50:23,770
a minute

846
00:50:23,770 --> 00:50:27,970
we're over the cliff and falling yessir
yeah just a couple points ventures in

847
00:50:27,970 --> 00:50:28,710
the question

848
00:50:28,710 --> 00:50:32,230
%uh the first thing is that a I agree
with your assessment I really wish ron

849
00:50:32,230 --> 00:50:34,880
Paul Dennis Kucinich we get serious
about things for both of them were gonna

850
00:50:34,880 --> 00:50:36,569
be out of a job come november

851
00:50:36,569 --> 00:50:39,829
for rather the summer this year since
neither one is running for reelection

852
00:50:39,829 --> 00:50:41,880
Dennis Kucinich can cause you got

853
00:50:41,880 --> 00:50:45,349
fucked by his own party happen right
into one from

854
00:50:45,349 --> 00:50:48,099
second point of interest as I think we
talk about what's the is what's the

855
00:50:48,099 --> 00:50:49,049
solution

856
00:50:49,049 --> 00:50:52,569
I feel like it's kinda cliche but maybe
it's someone applicable here that's a

857
00:50:52,569 --> 00:50:55,839
ya think globally act locally i think is
a huge lack local

858
00:50:55,839 --> 00:50:59,369
organized which is so YouTube we had
these big ideas are some the systemic

859
00:50:59,369 --> 00:50:59,819
problems

860
00:50:59,819 --> 00:51:03,200
really national and international scope
we it's all wrapped in them

861
00:51:03,200 --> 00:51:07,230
from an on sort academic radiological
perspective will be distracted

862
00:51:07,230 --> 00:51:11,420
we are and it distracts exactly from
getting around her neighbors now friends

863
00:51:11,420 --> 00:51:13,380
where the strongest bonds can be made

864
00:51:13,380 --> 00:51:16,900
and from those actual resistance from
the grassroots up can happen

865
00:51:16,900 --> 00:51:20,619
so I feel like oftentimes maybe we all
need to take a step back and realize

866
00:51:20,619 --> 00:51:24,190
where the fight to live who the fuck we
talk to him what we do

867
00:51:24,190 --> 00:51:27,640
because we are very isolated culture and
that's I think at the root of a lover

868
00:51:27,640 --> 00:51:28,180
problems

869
00:51:28,180 --> 00:51:31,369
it is and I am NOT and Paul Goodman
wrote a wonderful book in nineteen

870
00:51:31,369 --> 00:51:33,509
sixties call community us

871
00:51:33,509 --> 00:51:36,809
and I continue to recommend it are you
can

872
00:51:36,809 --> 00:51:41,250
build a forty foot biosphere which has
to lock your fish with plant on top in

873
00:51:41,250 --> 00:51:42,930
to feed a family of five

874
00:51:42,930 --> 00:51:47,180
for year arm I've made a lot of mistakes
in my life

875
00:51:47,180 --> 00:51:51,369
and the biggest mistake I made was was
moving out on my wife in spending too

876
00:51:51,369 --> 00:51:54,759
much money on on a townhouse it finally
became a short sale what I should have

877
00:51:54,759 --> 00:51:57,199
done was taken her house of the greater

878
00:51:57,199 --> 00:52:00,670
and created my own little office
apartment out there but we should be

879
00:52:00,670 --> 00:52:03,930
taking I mean in new hampshire all
houses are built today have generators

880
00:52:03,930 --> 00:52:05,180
builder

881
00:52:05,180 --> 00:52:10,109
automatically I mean if I were County
Supervisor I would be taking my county

882
00:52:10,109 --> 00:52:11,190
of the greater

883
00:52:11,190 --> 00:52:15,170
are and all these wild ass ideas about
wind farms and all that stuff

884
00:52:15,170 --> 00:52:17,460
centralized energy does not work

885
00:52:17,460 --> 00:52:20,529
you lose 50 percent in the downstream
process

886
00:52:20,529 --> 00:52:24,960
it's about solar and wind and and an
automobile's ninety-two percent of

887
00:52:24,960 --> 00:52:25,859
automobiles

888
00:52:25,859 --> 00:52:31,130
their energy is like wasted arm so i i
agree with you and if my wife did not

889
00:52:31,130 --> 00:52:32,949
have a government job

890
00:52:32,949 --> 00:52:36,250
my dream would be to buy a 51 foot a

891
00:52:36,250 --> 00:52:41,089
a Beneteau Shanis are and basically get
off the greater

892
00:52:41,089 --> 00:52:44,328
internet water maker air conditioning
the whole bit

893
00:52:44,329 --> 00:52:48,089
arm so world we're all captive but I
absolutely

894
00:52:48,089 --> 00:52:52,160
agree with you that it man voltaire said
this actually he said

895
00:52:52,160 --> 00:52:55,618
you know sometimes all I can handle is
my garden arm

896
00:52:55,619 --> 00:52:59,099
so I think there's a lot I was the man
what you say and I'm particularly

897
00:52:59,099 --> 00:53:02,160
a impress were done okay

898
00:53:02,160 --> 00:53:05,690
Aug get one more question to stop here

899
00:53:05,690 --> 00:53:10,319
one more okay arm here

900
00:53:10,319 --> 00:53:16,009
Arg you're particularly impressed by
alsop rosemary somebody Tom at leaf you

901

evolutionary activism and he's got a new

904
00:53:26,549 --> 00:53:27,619
book coming out on

905
00:53:27,619 --> 00:53:32,719
on the wisdom the people but urban
gardening is coming back

906
00:53:32,719 --> 00:53:37,290
and 10 things we're gonna find out as a
lot of the skyscrapers gonna be hoax

907
00:53:37,290 --> 00:53:41,160
like you're gonna have to really
reinvent the whole skyscraper concept

908
00:53:41,160 --> 00:53:46,199
arm soap I actually great local is good
let me get warmer questionable stuff

909
00:53:46,199 --> 00:53:48,150
because this gentleman's been standing

910

boy be re-live million things into my
head you talk to agriculture I'm a

year old bond paid for left I can agree

916

reconstruction acts after the Civil War
AAU

921
00:54:30,089 --> 00:54:35,239
are Association sure you wear behaviors
than the the primary pointed

922
00:54:35,239 --> 00:54:39,960
that I'm aware of is it the Civil War
was actually a war of secession

923
00:54:39,960 --> 00:54:43,250
it was an illegal war are Lincoln had no
right there

at midnight

926
00:54:48,369 --> 00:54:53,569
%uh but bottom line here is I'll be out
all these wars have been about money

927
00:54:53,569 --> 00:54:57,719
and bankers have funded both sides but
go on what do what you want to do in the

928
00:54:57,719 --> 00:54:59,140
way of a statement or a question

932
00:55:10,980 --> 00:55:16,009
jam through the 14th minute cuz the war
was more almost about states rights

933
00:55:16,009 --> 00:55:19,420
because the South what the North won't
implement 14 now which nationalize

934
00:55:19,420 --> 00:55:20,210
citizenship

Federation it's alright federal

government that there's in the organic
government the there's a

939
