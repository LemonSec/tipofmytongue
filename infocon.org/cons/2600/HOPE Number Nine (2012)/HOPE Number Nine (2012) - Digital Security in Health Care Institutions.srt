1
00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:03,100
thanks to the corroborate what the
previous speaker said

2
00:00:03,100 --> 00:00:07,680
that like it's extremely blinding so if
I close my eyes I'm not about to fall

3
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:08,000
asleep

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,080
a quick bite almost like to smoke like
this

5
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:14,610
can be difficult to look up with like
arm

6
00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:18,340
so this is the way it's going to work
I'm gonna give a little interaction

7
00:00:18,340 --> 00:00:21,689
on who are weighing whether do is save
his things

8
00:00:21,689 --> 00:00:25,350
and all then are my for an hour with
them

9
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:28,550
will be hanging on the though technical
details and

10
00:00:28,550 --> 00:00:32,940
and interesting stuff if I did thanks
just under not scared to death

11
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:37,870
then I'll close the presentation by
proposing something so we can do about

12
00:00:37,870 --> 00:00:38,210
it

13
00:00:38,210 --> 00:00:41,320
because they're gonna hear on a scary
stuff today

14
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:45,629
so brief interaction who are we in what
we do here

15
00:00:45,629 --> 00:00:49,539
arm a few hopes ago hope number six

16
00:00:49,539 --> 00:00:52,579
we gave a talk a very different one

17
00:00:52,579 --> 00:00:56,559
I I don't recall any of your faces but I
wouldn't even if I

18
00:00:56,559 --> 00:01:00,680
if I saw you their soul home we talked
about copyleft

19
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:03,840
and against batons and p2p networks and
all that

20
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:08,010
I'll at that time I explain how

21
00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:11,220
ha I was selector universe in Spain that
was

22
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:14,810
kicked off the University for dippin for
defending p2p networks

23
00:01:14,810 --> 00:01:18,960
the Motion Picture Association of
America didn't like my stance against

24
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:19,900
copyright

25
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:23,460
our so the pressure to the net kicked
out

26
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:26,900
lecture about it I'll tour the world
speakin

27
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:30,380
that annoying little story and

28
00:01:30,380 --> 00:01:34,259
that got me thinking I got it involving
two a lot of our

29
00:01:34,259 --> 00:01:38,520
debates a ball alternative methods have
done it if

30
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:42,048
business models in the world of couple
left them

31
00:01:42,049 --> 00:01:47,610
all that so I decided that he was about
time to do something

32
00:01:47,610 --> 00:01:50,700
not just talk about copula not just talk
about

33
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:54,490
free software but to do something to to
proof this people they were wrong

34
00:01:54,490 --> 00:01:58,200
they wouldn't listen the reason they
wouldn't Res listen to university

35
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:02,350
studies and numbers soulless speak the
language they speak which is money

36
00:02:02,350 --> 00:02:05,880
so let's start a company that makes

37
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:09,979
money with for its ok where and prove to
them that you can be done

38
00:02:09,979 --> 00:02:13,620
that's why I started this company all I
want to mention them this is not

39
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:14,319
celibate

40
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:18,360
I'll and I figure free software

41
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:21,770
in which industry and I thought well

42
00:02:21,770 --> 00:02:25,010
I'll what's the most saturated market

43
00:02:25,010 --> 00:02:28,609
and jet controlled by the biggest
corporations there are the least

44
00:02:28,610 --> 00:02:32,650
willing to call open source free
software are

45
00:02:32,650 --> 00:02:38,530
jet military and I'll after that I don't
like to mess with the pentagon

46
00:02:38,530 --> 00:02:42,060
man anymore at all arm I Jess

47
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:46,310
the health care health care industry is
control dominated by

48
00:02:46,310 --> 00:02:50,090
are hob number of large corporations

49
00:02:50,090 --> 00:02:53,739
duval know them I won't mention them
I'll

50
00:02:53,739 --> 00:02:57,430
but they're very few and control a very
large market share

51
00:02:57,430 --> 00:03:00,599
so every time that happens and

52
00:03:00,599 --> 00:03:04,489
the incentive to innovate the incentive
to collaborate

53
00:03:04,489 --> 00:03:08,920
the incentive to be open is extremely
small I mean if you control a very large

54
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:12,670
is on the market you know who cares
about what the customer wants who cares

55
00:03:12,670 --> 00:03:13,450
about innovating

56
00:03:13,450 --> 00:03:16,840
who cares about and I'm not saying these
companies don't innovate I'm not saying

57
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:17,560
this company's

58
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:20,849
individuals that working there don't
care

59
00:03:20,849 --> 00:03:24,040
I'm just same ask companies us market
dynamics goes

60
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:27,170
it just doesn't happen so true now

61
00:03:27,170 --> 00:03:30,890
start this company knew nobody knew
nothing about this stuff

62
00:03:30,890 --> 00:03:35,670
and now all just get the run a few of my
friends in hackers and programmers and

63
00:03:35,670 --> 00:03:38,959
stuff and so let's do things in the
medical devices industry in the medical

64
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:39,659
software

65
00:03:39,659 --> 00:03:43,700
industry in let's see what's out there
well true enough

66
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:46,750
as soon as we started we realize they
were a lot of things to be done we

67
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:48,120
consider a medical image in

68
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:51,400
but what other things that a notice from
they won

69
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:54,849
and I said something I gotta speak about
this and today's

70
00:03:54,849 --> 00:03:58,280
that someday up is that very

71
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:01,980
scary security thing

72
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:05,150
in hospitals in health care networks in
environments

73
00:04:05,150 --> 00:04:09,659
arm I know some of you worked for
hospital

74
00:04:09,659 --> 00:04:13,140
are like sys admins those doubts I know
some of you like

75
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:17,370
no more than I do about this stuff but
most of it don't sew up so in a few

76
00:04:17,370 --> 00:04:20,820
terms that probably other will be
mentioned so you know what it is

77
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:25,610
I'll duvall been hospital know what it
is and stuff so you imagine this

78
00:04:25,610 --> 00:04:26,419
scanners

79
00:04:26,419 --> 00:04:30,080
for example I mean you're gonna cities
can you get an xray you get up

80
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:33,340
aldrich sound the role scanners to me
this camp thanks

81
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:38,050
all those circle modalities in hospital

82
00:04:38,050 --> 00:04:42,550
I'll those moralities don't

83
00:04:42,550 --> 00:04:45,949
act like your regular scanner like
desktop scanner

84
00:04:45,949 --> 00:04:49,440
some to summary loss in just for your
day back

85
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:52,580
but most of them will

86
00:04:52,580 --> 00:04:56,270
output some file that is in a particular
format should be a DICOM

87
00:04:56,270 --> 00:05:00,900
file Somare different in non complain
that comes and someone

88
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:05,259
really weird but big they got their own
files they got their own protocols

89
00:05:05,259 --> 00:05:09,550
to talk to each other you got the server
the server cannot be just the server

90
00:05:09,550 --> 00:05:13,020
I mean if you do be do you have a server
if you do

91
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:17,289
mail you have a server if you do whips a
website issue have a server

92
00:05:17,289 --> 00:05:21,719
if you own health care you have a pax
cousin I health care people

93
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:24,889
cooler when you different acronyms I'll

94
00:05:24,889 --> 00:05:29,229
and the pacs is a server that X files
that this happened to be Beckham

95
00:05:29,229 --> 00:05:32,870
and communicated through their own
protocol dis in their own poor Cindy in

96
00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:33,530
there don't

97
00:05:33,530 --> 00:05:38,460
kind of stuff but this the server and
the scanners are scanners

98
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:42,440
the disease in their own kind of thing
well there goes on and on with

99
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:46,130
all the things in the network in the
hospital so meet their hospitals have to

100
00:05:46,130 --> 00:05:46,759
get worse

101
00:05:46,759 --> 00:05:50,539
have files have servers just like
everybody else but they are a little

102
00:05:50,539 --> 00:05:51,740
different

103
00:05:51,740 --> 00:05:55,030
why are they different because that way
the large companies that

104
00:05:55,030 --> 00:05:58,840
that dominated market can keep on
dominated quite

105
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:02,460
so they thought a few years ago

106
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:06,729
I'll there was little change in the
industry in the realize that couldn't

107
00:06:06,729 --> 00:06:08,050
keep up with this

108
00:06:08,050 --> 00:06:11,819
this is mine and i wanna let you play
with my toys kind of attitude

109
00:06:11,819 --> 00:06:14,819
may start to try to collaborate with
each other all

110
00:06:14,819 --> 00:06:18,780
and ask what hell broke lose our
security

111
00:06:18,780 --> 00:06:21,979
stuff started having you here something
some pressure you

112
00:06:21,979 --> 00:06:27,430
all are her stories in the news about
data breaches in taxes and all that

113
00:06:27,430 --> 00:06:30,490
arm and is gonna get a lot

114
00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:34,509
a lot worse because the holes are there

115
00:06:34,509 --> 00:06:38,419
they're not listen to block they're not
playing nyse: enough Latinas

116
00:06:38,419 --> 00:06:42,530
when you go are let's do this this and
that is corroborated this

117
00:06:42,530 --> 00:06:45,680
open let's share this information the
net

118
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:50,720
about to let that happen arms suggests
that you have any idea

119
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:53,889
on how difficult this is and how messy

120
00:06:53,889 --> 00:06:57,210
other like to say we'll tell you stories
where they we gather

121
00:06:57,210 --> 00:07:01,729
the stories from all that Google like
everybody else but

122
00:07:01,729 --> 00:07:05,169
most are from our experience I'll we
have insulation

123
00:07:05,169 --> 00:07:08,729
15 countries with work with like

124
00:07:08,729 --> 00:07:11,740
national health systems that we
controlled the whole system

125
00:07:11,740 --> 00:07:15,280
and we man its tens of millions of
images

126
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:19,419
every time we move something around and
we were with the late little tiny

127
00:07:19,419 --> 00:07:20,830
clinics with two doctors

128
00:07:20,830 --> 00:07:24,750
that will be having their IMAX invest up
and that's the whole setup

129
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:29,240
so we have a up Broadview and weaves I
want say we've seen it all

139
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:08,370
arm this morning just this very morning
in this hospital

140
00:08:08,370 --> 00:08:12,280
I won't mention the hospital and want to
get in trouble is a customer of ours

141
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:15,770
are they have this big major
professional basketball player coming

142
00:08:15,770 --> 00:08:19,539
for a routine checkup minutes later

143
00:08:19,539 --> 00:08:24,610
this online news service saying these

144
00:08:24,610 --> 00:08:27,900
and here's the emitting just what's
wrong with them in

145
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:31,810
everybody's paranoid everybody's
freaking out my phone is ringing loud

146
00:08:31,810 --> 00:08:37,229

147
00:08:37,229 --> 00:08:41,240
it was an awful number one I going to do
is wait nominal

148
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:44,430
arm but I'll

149
00:08:44,430 --> 00:08:48,140
we tech we're loading and we discovered
it was some somebody

150
00:08:48,140 --> 00:08:51,319
a nurse from the inside I want to make
an extra bach

151
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:55,070
and went to sell this story to do so it
was in the fall of the software

152
00:08:55,070 --> 00:08:59,140
he was in the fall of the system of the
server was no hacker was no

153

262
00:15:24,199 --> 00:15:27,560
other parts on on the software and if
they don't finess

263
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:31,110
on a call right time that dip to the
ends of not

00:15:31,110 --> 00:15:33,710
a

265
00:15:33,710 --> 00:15:36,600
production that dot the I

266

and a control panel them out into the
Sun all matching green and black

269
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:50,439
so the doctor stuff we're running these
nineteen don't

270
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:54,980
bet we're used to it that you see daily

00:16:01,130 --> 00:16:05,720
a when they're doctoring put that on the

278
00:16:19,290 --> 00:16:22,630
you were expecting for what's worse from

00:18:04,180 --> 00:18:07,710
because this is very new to their to the
hospital Sun

311
00:18:07,710 --> 00:18:11,040
and desist not like your computers that
are

312
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:14,540
hun elf Houston's Miata computers on the

feet by doctor medical companies Harvey

318
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:36,440
hard to get information about that the
Anna I

319
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:39,940
open at 11 makeup on I believe so I

missus whirlwind you will be reasonably
healthy and BQ of

321

somewhere or just just because soul

322
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:51,490
a one of the

323
00:18:51,490 --> 00:18:54,800
he's here most common I recall be

324
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:58,370
like up at the Brits so all the same
receive

325
00:18:58,370 --> 00:19:01,770
which had for these at the time the most
common kind of woman are you tease

326
00:19:01,770 --> 00:19:05,360
way people relief fine every day and I
knew somebody

327
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:10,870
on newspaper a due to the vast saint of
information up to

328
00:19:10,870 --> 00:19:13,970
columns on it was her b-day song I

329
00:19:13,970 --> 00:19:17,740
this kind of topic believe the network
which of a fixation if we don

330
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:22,450
follow all the usual requirements for
security that usual

331
00:19:22,450 --> 00:19:26,540
take on every to become middle for you

332
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:30,270
up but howdy we'd with we r

333
00:19:30,270 --> 00:19:34,310
I went to Cedar liked two most common
stunned us on

334
00:19:34,310 --> 00:19:38,600
on hospitals forty these kind of thing
so we have hl7

335
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:42,730
uses stepped on him for health level
seven help but 70s like an association

336
00:19:42,730 --> 00:19:42,990
of

337
00:19:42,990 --> 00:19:47,290
companies that to make a stand that's
funny exchanging information between

338
00:19:47,290 --> 00:19:51,520
medical sophomore so

339
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:52,710
level 7

340
00:19:52,710 --> 00:19:56,940
the level seven parties because his eat
it's over there

341
00:19:56,940 --> 00:19:59,960
I'll later seven on the OSI model hi

342
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:03,220
if some up you know tcp/ip so it means
he's are on the

343
00:20:03,220 --> 00:20:06,570
application 11 sought the seaside are on
there information that

344
00:20:06,570 --> 00:20:09,879
a pic a source attains so

345
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:13,460
whale about want for one side

346
00:20:13,460 --> 00:20:17,600
it refers to their to the cities in the
dusty system that but on the other side

347
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:18,500
it also names

348
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:22,200
the star sum up this time not that big
creates a light hah

349
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:26,770
its low 8-cell 7 rush into a mission 3
and so on

350
00:20:26,770 --> 00:20:30,970
so he has done this to find a serious
car from the satyrs that can

351
00:20:30,970 --> 00:20:34,090
sayings difference up was at full list
under

352
00:20:34,090 --> 00:20:37,629
for I miss a channel like when my new

353
00:20:37,630 --> 00:20:42,080
more I base in a segregated on hospital
when debasing

354
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:45,580
so stop on the hospital for getting a
tech for Owen

355
00:20:45,580 --> 00:20:49,279
his a under some sort of

356
00:20:49,279 --> 00:20:53,840
dastaan one my team has to says the
other that he's going to show up

357
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:58,230
for example you're going to get an xray
and and x-ray machine is going to get a

358
00:20:58,230 --> 00:20:59,640
message from the central my

359
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:03,679
a seven-minute monitor for knowing that
his 12 so often

360
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:07,000
you have all the data there be from here
without

361
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:10,940
reading top I it will send a doctor what
medication do you need them

362
00:21:10,940 --> 00:21:14,630
and he will send the billing department
what do you have to pay or

363
00:21:14,630 --> 00:21:20,610
even we'll tell them that you haven't
picked but the other most common it on

364
00:21:20,610 --> 00:21:21,399
these DICOM

365
00:21:21,399 --> 00:21:24,409
that whorehouse said and the cease a

366
00:21:24,409 --> 00:21:29,059
around radiology departments essentially
with because up

367
00:21:29,059 --> 00:21:32,918
even X if you he sustained and one on
the department is

368
00:21:32,919 --> 00:21:36,559
for the all his where issues at the most
and East's

369
00:21:36,559 --> 00:21:40,539
Afghanistan there that's about the file
format for a change in medically meters

370
00:21:40,539 --> 00:21:41,440
and also

371
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:44,720
what the network from so eat names both
their

372
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:49,809
network and the file format for it soul

373
00:21:49,809 --> 00:21:53,210
eat dusts are a pair of things

374
00:21:53,210 --> 00:21:57,770
three mostly sorry name as their file
format for saying they may test

375
00:21:57,770 --> 00:22:01,059
it eat issues for printing the meters on
a special

376
00:22:01,059 --> 00:22:04,059
are regularly bring to us we meeting
bring to us

377
00:22:04,059 --> 00:22:07,770
a it's saving me to network I it also

378
00:22:07,770 --> 00:22:11,889
we'll receive some s8 as one when you
show up for a test run

379
00:22:11,889 --> 00:22:16,360
and everything are everything on that
day confirming arm

380
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:20,740
sop distrust just and that's when the
usual every hospital so

cheaper

387
00:22:43,409 --> 00:22:46,429
getting to healthy on is

388
00:22:46,429 --> 00:22:50,549
a like a way of connecting every so you
call

389
00:22:50,549 --> 00:22:53,899
a you called I by I

390
00:22:53,899 --> 00:22:57,960
by at that every time with this is
difficult to say

391
00:22:57,960 --> 00:23:02,669
are not directly because you pull the
knife somebody s knocks on the network

392
00:23:02,669 --> 00:23:03,169
on

393
00:23:03,169 --> 00:23:07,850
attacks on information about your I'll
Roger billion are

394
00:23:07,850 --> 00:23:11,299
take some up to make a roommate is how

of

399
00:23:22,850 --> 00:23:28,220
motivation the call cut so saw them DC
sup very low expectation that people

400
00:23:28,220 --> 00:23:28,809
live it up

401
00:23:28,809 --> 00:23:32,129
but Fretz so we are going to be like
down down on the scale of

402
00:23:32,130 --> 00:23:38,860
and I am by computers on the other side
we have some kinds of

403
00:23:38,860 --> 00:23:42,220
bodies related attacks so we can talk
about day

404
00:23:42,220 --> 00:23:46,179
dare fairly high what like D your next
time below the fact 25

405
00:23:46,179 --> 00:23:49,539

going

426
00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:08,590

low-power radio incite

427
00:25:08,590 --> 00:25:12,730
so the doctor can connect to you to give
the bias Sun and three key information

on how to dock door rebuilt he's the
really to shop

440
00:25:52,129 --> 00:25:56,730
is a computer anyway so this is one of

458
00:26:56,149 --> 00:26:59,460
I don't know the score this device in
Concord he has some deep some

466
00:27:27,010 --> 00:27:30,059
yeah so anyway this this guy

467
00:27:30,059 --> 00:27:34,990
a dis these devices are I has some kind
of radio-controlled

468
00:27:34,990 --> 00:27:39,210
are so the sky discovered that he call I

469
00:27:39,210 --> 00:27:43,409
a goal over the security I

470
00:27:43,409 --> 00:27:46,600
s me sir stepped-up that discuss

471
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:49,649
and pool air although the totally
positive

472
00:27:49,649 --> 00:27:54,120
insulin inside of him we had one in

473
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:57,909
thats not wat for had asked that no
would really so

474
00:27:57,909 --> 00:28:01,879
a theoretically devise that he was
wearing because he is

475
00:28:01,879 --> 00:28:05,299
narrative anyway and I also have some
kind of warning that be great see if

476
00:28:05,299 --> 00:28:06,200
that

477
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:09,379
the Palm Beach begun begins to 25cm

478
00:28:09,379 --> 00:28:12,799
asahi people saw jump over that
protection and

479
00:28:12,799 --> 00:28:15,899
damp all their full I deposit of

480
00:28:15,899 --> 00:28:18,980
insulin on him sadat's do call light

481
00:28:18,980 --> 00:28:23,850
but that I he discovered that with
national and another device is something

482
00:28:23,850 --> 00:28:24,879
that he may

483
00:28:24,879 --> 00:28:29,299
a himself IOC cool for some like

484
00:28:29,299 --> 00:28:33,129
even 100 feet away or so so he COO

485
00:28:33,129 --> 00:28:37,100
make these excite device up

486
00:28:37,100 --> 00:28:40,950
empty although the basin deposits on
somebody

487
00:28:40,950 --> 00:28:43,970
I these US was made by the Metromix

488
00:28:43,970 --> 00:28:47,609
I McBurney said you can even say
anything like for a year

489
00:28:47,609 --> 00:28:51,210
something like that I they didn't even
say

490
00:28:51,210 --> 00:28:55,669
like you its the fic all these hardest
not to like a

491

I am Not sure

494
00:29:05,889 --> 00:29:09,760
about it arm that was a very famous

495
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:12,940
I problem but there you haha to

496
00:29:12,940 --> 00:29:17,669
will have read is like by mine 2001 at
this is a similar case to the one to

497
00:29:17,669 --> 00:29:19,240
that fact 25

498
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:22,280
for a drink sone T SC

499
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:25,690

base house

501
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:33,139
a died or dispose a trace on arm

502
00:29:33,139 --> 00:29:37,010
a date at the promised a founder is
there

503
00:29:37,010 --> 00:29:41,150
the half our lack of plan verification
so they didn't happen this time the

504
00:29:41,150 --> 00:29:45,500
for weekly or monthly or whatever to
take what how much progress from there

505
00:29:45,500 --> 00:29:48,870
they were receiving so I R

506
00:29:48,870 --> 00:29:52,710
how many people day a already Calif five
of the deaths

507
00:29:52,710 --> 00:29:55,910
way related to that already a chance saw

508
00:29:55,910 --> 00:29:59,180
some people they there but is nice not
only out of our

509
00:29:59,180 --> 00:30:02,910
the States but both said are seen I
discover like two years ago that

510
00:30:02,910 --> 00:30:06,420
at during 18 months some patrons

511
00:30:06,420 --> 00:30:09,640
hundreds of of patients were receiving
like

512
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:14,510
a I don't like sorry like

513
00:30:14,510 --> 00:30:18,490
20 to 50 percent more a reason that they
sort I

514
00:30:18,490 --> 00:30:22,470
only because the doctor about setup fast
no matching when the matching

515
00:30:22,470 --> 00:30:26,220
came to the hospital I set up some maybe
you'll

516
00:30:26,220 --> 00:30:29,620
incorrectly and nobody a

517
00:30:29,620 --> 00:30:34,640
ever found that a these much in was even
too much radiation so did the

518
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:38,290
the confinement Eagle a year and a half
later people

519
00:30:38,290 --> 00:30:43,550
kept loosing all that hair when they did
and and investigated up but even

520
00:30:43,550 --> 00:30:48,090
even their usual I test on there on the
18

521
00:30:48,090 --> 00:30:51,530
but they made like monthly are sought
discover why

522
00:30:51,530 --> 00:30:54,649
is was failing saw

523
00:30:54,650 --> 00:30:58,420

582
00:34:29,889 --> 00:34:32,960
for killing people randomly if you yes

583
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:36,429
Haas some kind of device when the rival

I am one site I'll never attribute

585
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:43,670
monies what that which is adequately
explained by stupidity

586
00:34:43,670 --> 00:34:46,750
story this is how nice race or so

587
00:34:46,750 --> 00:34:49,929
and almost every of those people

588
00:34:49,929 --> 00:34:53,429
I that were responsible up the arse
those box

589
00:34:53,429 --> 00:34:56,589

squaring off

593
00:35:08,660 --> 00:35:12,940
with faith and the promise already Cali
I still think that they were trying to

594
00:35:12,940 --> 00:35:13,790
do that with fame but

595
00:35:13,790 --> 00:35:18,210
do when Lacey or date did annual gay
just in your car

596
00:35:18,210 --> 00:35:21,960
and even do with bright mmm

597
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:26,060
but you have to but you have to see what
the FDA says hardy subway failure stress

598
00:35:26,060 --> 00:35:26,640
possible

599
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:32,970
24 percent of all medical devices
recalls so I me think that this is

600
00:35:32,970 --> 00:35:37,610
really think euros and this is a thing
right now I

601
00:35:37,610 --> 00:35:41,750
on your side people he has no motivation
to cause the Knights

602

kill somebody that he beat these

608
00:36:05,430 --> 00:36:08,609
doesn't even know we scheme just because

609
00:36:08,610 --> 00:36:11,970
because people massive so we yes cannot

610
00:36:11,970 --> 00:36:16,780
spectrum with faith people for not
killing you would be happier party unity

611
00:36:16,780 --> 00:36:21,380
23 your

612
00:36:21,380 --> 00:36:25,460
I don't know if you can remember this
but you can remember that seek are all

613
00:36:25,460 --> 00:36:27,360
keen on Mar this from 1982

614
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:31,630
some random people I don't think they
even

615
00:36:31,630 --> 00:36:35,910
called him I R decided to Kurt to clean
all from there

616
00:36:35,910 --> 00:36:39,720
on the pharmacists ticket com sorry

617
00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:43,070
they did to her up

618
00:36:43,070 --> 00:36:46,550
and feel it quits been on

619
00:36:46,550 --> 00:36:50,220
put it back on the concourse and let
people like just because

620
00:36:50,220 --> 00:36:55,160
so you you don't have to respect that

621
00:36:55,160 --> 00:37:00,149
people we want queues were just because
you're not important to you at

622
00:37:00,150 --> 00:37:03,390
you have no enemies arm

623
00:37:03,390 --> 00:37:08,629
saw you should adopt common sense a good
to practice this

624
00:37:08,630 --> 00:37:12,890
this is essentially for or not he says
man see something on hospital so maybe

625
00:37:12,890 --> 00:37:17,990
people are developing hardware or
software from incoming my sis

626
00:37:17,990 --> 00:37:21,320
up but II you have to promise here so

627
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:25,500
west side it's the fickle not only
because East

628
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:29,750
not only because he is the sequel to
make everything 100 percent percent safe

629
00:37:29,750 --> 00:37:30,140
but

630
00:37:30,140 --> 00:37:34,080
because right now everybody wants to
connect to every device so

631
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:37,930
are you half doctors want to connect
from the office s today a hospital

632
00:37:37,930 --> 00:37:40,080
network from there I passed from there

633
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:43,250
iPhones for from the home computers are
taking their

634
00:37:43,250 --> 00:37:46,620
the last seeing as it happened eso its

635
00:37:46,620 --> 00:37:50,890
very difficult to contain every device
on separate network in a secure network

636
00:37:50,890 --> 00:37:55,370
on and it's like car got past aunt
struggle to

637
00:37:55,370 --> 00:37:59,279
or to fight with them to maybe D don't
bail on me

638
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:02,830
everything me the day want arm

639
00:38:02,830 --> 00:38:08,069
on the other side also they won't let
you because there are some problems with

640
00:38:08,070 --> 00:38:09,060
the FDA

641
00:38:09,060 --> 00:38:12,990
a there are some good things that def

642
00:38:12,990 --> 00:38:18,600
FDA say so maybe a mandates to you to
get some thirty feet gates on

643
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:22,380
pass some test for getting your device
to the to the market

644
00:38:22,380 --> 00:38:26,350
but also and you cannot I like

645
00:38:26,350 --> 00:38:30,490
upgrade update your device like because
you have found a problem it right now

646
00:38:30,490 --> 00:38:32,310
you find a problem on our

647
00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:35,970
I'll I don't know an extreme %uh team
again or like a

648
00:38:35,970 --> 00:38:39,800
the swing by Amber whatever you cannot
ice I

649
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:44,120
as the maker you cannot update a field
where a lot ok locked up to the internet

650
00:38:44,120 --> 00:38:45,190
and just

651
00:38:45,190 --> 00:38:48,910
put it to everybody because the FDA a

652
00:38:48,910 --> 00:38:52,629
ask you to put all that thing where a
game to the best times

653
00:38:52,630 --> 00:38:56,270
have some bureaucracy going in and call
your lawyer send

654
00:38:56,270 --> 00:39:00,009
make some DC on Sat everything on it
will be delayed by

655
00:39:00,010 --> 00:39:03,140
by Mon so if you'll make sopped up the

656
00:39:03,140 --> 00:39:06,400
medical companies are pretty close about
dates a out the San

657
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:10,060
even if they wanted to do that is by the
fickle

658
00:39:10,060 --> 00:39:13,890
I you don't get I like the last to

659
00:39:13,890 --> 00:39:17,450
information on how's your medical device
working also

660
00:39:17,450 --> 00:39:21,340
I have ED date don't want people to know

661
00:39:21,340 --> 00:39:24,390
that some update devices cafe

662
00:39:24,390 --> 00:39:27,410
so are

663
00:39:27,410 --> 00:39:30,640
what's happening out this arm there are
some

664
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:34,080
I'll initiatives a

665
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:37,990
almost like public company great at the
SAS

666
00:39:37,990 --> 00:39:41,290
it's developing techniques all about 30
expertise to a seat

667
00:39:41,290 --> 00:39:45,450

is like very bacon I A it or not

671
00:39:54,910 --> 00:39:59,200
so sure the cali they are trying to get
every device they get for testing for

672
00:39:59,200 --> 00:39:59,880
MBA

673
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:03,970

like huge

687
00:40:49,730 --> 00:40:53,590
because every failure of something to
confine their you can find a hospitality

688
00:40:53,590 --> 00:40:55,010
supple out there

689
00:40:55,010 --> 00:40:59,390

692
00:41:07,930 --> 00:41:11,620
no way of you doing that and only for
this year

693

700
00:41:38,530 --> 00:41:41,570
the same guy to discover the infected
website

701
00:41:41,570 --> 00:41:45,150
a piece working on this is some kind of

702
00:41:45,150 --> 00:41:48,510
I am I

703
00:41:48,510 --> 00:41:51,520
for I don't know

704
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:56,240
initiative that they have put together
so every implanted medical device that

705
00:41:56,240 --> 00:42:00,030
at cannot be use anymore for a human
because

706
00:42:00,030 --> 00:42:03,790
already you sorry a failure to whatever
you can donate that

707
00:42:03,790 --> 00:42:07,710
I do tonight every device there so they
take the device s

708
00:42:07,710 --> 00:42:10,300
I clean them and

709
00:42:10,300 --> 00:42:13,740
them the on the other side is joining
but un investigator you can

710
00:42:13,740 --> 00:42:16,870
ask them forget medical devices and
tells them they

711
00:42:16,870 --> 00:42:20,580
the you can borrow the devices for one
year on

712
00:42:20,580 --> 00:42:23,790
make every kind of security devices
security test

713
00:42:23,790 --> 00:42:27,610
on I don't know over them for getting

714
00:42:27,610 --> 00:42:31,720
paper a paper about security or maybe
for just investigation because you are

715
00:42:31,720 --> 00:42:34,480
gloria or something a complete so you
have to have two

716
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:37,520
produced on their way bet you can also
find our with

717
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:40,660
OMB your hell I were

718
00:42:40,660 --> 00:42:45,379
these a way to come to this and feel the
forms and ask for the base

719
00:42:45,380 --> 00:42:49,660
you call even destroy some devices if
it's needed you just have to ask

720
00:42:49,660 --> 00:42:52,870
for our concrete the bias that each case

721
00:42:52,870 --> 00:42:55,980
going to half I don't know I destructive
I'll

722
00:42:55,980 --> 00:42:59,280
test so lemme

723
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:02,360
by Westside I juggle say that

724
00:43:02,360 --> 00:43:06,250
I'll there are some people doing things

725
00:43:06,250 --> 00:43:10,630
but I is Sperry I'm very worried about
their

726
00:43:10,630 --> 00:43:12,550
medi-cal a

727
00:43:12,550 --> 00:43:16,540
medical companies being so being so
close on the FDA vein

728
00:43:16,540 --> 00:43:20,500
sometimes to Highlander on their

729
00:43:20,500 --> 00:43:25,240
on the formation and i will like like
the All India out people

730
00:43:25,240 --> 00:43:30,400
some people I'll open and even more
access to to make other buy cistern

731
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:33,930
and be more safe already saw

732
00:43:33,930 --> 00:43:36,960
you have seen this is like a general up
your

733
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:40,970
and you know I'll I impression of how
sick working right now

734
00:43:40,970 --> 00:43:44,010
I am and letting her happiness

735
00:43:44,010 --> 00:43:49,140
on you can ask some questions now a
maybe you have something more to me call

736
00:43:49,140 --> 00:43:52,580
later after we finished weaker you can
beat us

737
00:43:52,580 --> 00:43:56,259
thank you so now you know why I

738
00:43:56,260 --> 00:43:59,599
home usually when people go to doctor
you know

739
00:43:59,599 --> 00:44:03,089
are doctors you you've got a virus %ah

740
00:44:03,089 --> 00:44:07,060
when we go to the doctor with a like or
you got a virus home

741
00:44:07,060 --> 00:44:10,430
and in an industry that huh funny when
we say that because

742
00:44:10,430 --> 00:44:14,149
really know what could happen arm soul
what do we do

743
00:44:14,150 --> 00:44:17,240
and I know some of you are thinking okay
with this

744
00:44:17,240 --> 00:44:20,710
wait until george bush goes to the
hospital

745
00:44:20,710 --> 00:44:24,510
and now we play a little be with those

746
00:44:24,510 --> 00:44:28,810
in the radiation miss him now investor
serv

747
00:44:28,810 --> 00:44:32,470
that's not what I mean arm what do we do
about the situation

748
00:44:32,470 --> 00:44:36,640
arm a single-minded approach

749
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:41,540
digitally wrong so if we expect let a
government

750
00:44:41,540 --> 00:44:46,200
to take care of us I do government my
government e-government I don't care

751
00:44:46,200 --> 00:44:50,839
we're from usually is that if that's the
only answer that's wrong

752
00:44:50,839 --> 00:44:54,640
I mean and that's what happens when you
get the FDA overloaded

753
00:44:54,640 --> 00:44:58,368
with work mean the this year's the
overgrowth with work I got friends there

754
00:44:58,369 --> 00:44:59,109
and they

755
00:44:59,109 --> 00:45:03,259
the cat deal with anymore and did they
have all the information they put all

756
00:45:03,260 --> 00:45:03,910
the wet

757
00:45:03,910 --> 00:45:07,500
now is withholding it anything but they
can make it easy to work

758
00:45:07,500 --> 00:45:11,920
with that information so that
information is really not good arm

759
00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:15,450
you can expect are so the law many

760
00:45:15,450 --> 00:45:18,800
call for you up to some point you can
expect

761
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:22,010
also a lot to cover everything and then
make a Sohar

762
00:45:22,010 --> 00:45:26,020
on device manufacturers the can't even
take a step

763
00:45:26,020 --> 00:45:29,140
with up mountain of bureaucracy I mean
%um

764
00:45:29,140 --> 00:45:34,049
admiral to them so shall we rely on the
device manufacturers

765
00:45:34,050 --> 00:45:37,060
on the company's companies like us home

766
00:45:37,060 --> 00:45:40,359
Natalie are because

767
00:45:40,359 --> 00:45:43,630
economic interests I mean you know that
Bieber

768
00:45:43,630 --> 00:45:47,290
the bird comic strip never got to choose

769
00:45:47,290 --> 00:45:51,990
money people money people money money
money money money what

770
00:45:51,990 --> 00:45:55,080
also they're not gonna think people

771
00:45:55,080 --> 00:45:58,270
nothing customers if if

772
00:45:58,270 --> 00:46:01,589
anything most likely they're only gonna
think money arm

773
00:46:01,589 --> 00:46:06,940
shall we rely on you sir should doctors
become technology experts

774
00:46:06,940 --> 00:46:10,170
and know every Hold'em Realty know how
to close some

775
00:46:10,170 --> 00:46:13,180
know what to do not only

776
00:46:13,180 --> 00:46:16,359
you can expect that I mean the guy spend

777
00:46:16,359 --> 00:46:20,200
god knows how many years in college to
get that degree

778
00:46:20,200 --> 00:46:23,480
and now he's too busy of i mean we're
departs for I mean

779
00:46:23,480 --> 00:46:27,030
home did not live in care to the to the
pension

780
00:46:27,030 --> 00:46:30,960
he's not gonna spend hours and hours
reading technical magazines and stuff

781
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:32,180
and that's understandable

782
00:46:32,180 --> 00:46:35,950
arm do we rely on the hospital it.

783
00:46:35,950 --> 00:46:39,060
people not really

784
00:46:39,060 --> 00:46:42,480
because the also are overloaded with
work that

785
00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:46,310
I mean this is like a modern it's coming
to them at full speed olives and I

786
00:46:46,310 --> 00:46:50,440
lie cover said doctors want to connect
their iPhone to the iPad and ipad2 the

787
00:46:50,440 --> 00:46:51,150
iMac and

788
00:46:51,150 --> 00:46:54,349
iMac to the PC in the PC to the hotel's

789
00:46:54,349 --> 00:46:57,440
laptop on the hotel wanna connect to the
conference in the conference at a

790
00:46:57,440 --> 00:46:58,700
hospital in the hospital

791
00:46:58,700 --> 00:47:02,570
to the medical device and you think I'm
joking I seen that happen

792
00:47:02,570 --> 00:47:05,710
I've had a customer asking for that I
say

793
00:47:05,710 --> 00:47:11,530
just for the fun of it could you repeat
that and the promise only going to get

794
00:47:11,530 --> 00:47:12,119
bigger

795
00:47:12,119 --> 00:47:15,180
I mean there's going to be more devices
economy more things connector

796
00:47:15,180 --> 00:47:19,430
are just this is you have a picture up
do you know how big

797
00:47:19,430 --> 00:47:22,830
I'm I typical hospital server on the
four image in

798
00:47:22,830 --> 00:47:26,098
this our average customer house between

799
00:47:26,099 --> 00:47:29,500
50 and 70 terabytes in the server I'm

800
00:47:29,500 --> 00:47:33,940
working working images working memory is
not just in case

801
00:47:33,940 --> 00:47:37,950
aren't there working they're dealing
with this kind of information best today

802
00:47:37,950 --> 00:47:42,369
the growth is exponential but we just
introduce

803
00:47:42,369 --> 00:47:46,540
a new software that allows it to that
with pathology ca pathology images

804
00:47:46,540 --> 00:47:49,880
digital pathology images which means

805
00:47:49,880 --> 00:47:53,450
their servers are going to be want to
play my 100

806
00:47:53,450 --> 00:47:57,359
within months

807
00:47:57,359 --> 00:48:01,359
dist picture all that information all
the Service are those connections

808
00:48:01,359 --> 00:48:04,520
so is not gonna happen single handle it
if I

809
00:48:04,520 --> 00:48:07,780
had to give a magic receive I'll say

810
00:48:07,780 --> 00:48:11,650
hack the hell out of hospitals

811
00:48:11,650 --> 00:48:16,060
every time your net do near hospital
hack the hell I love it

812
00:48:16,060 --> 00:48:19,960
and please forgive me if you work for
hospital IT department

813
00:48:19,960 --> 00:48:24,349
you know I I sympathize with you my
customer I love you

814
00:48:24,349 --> 00:48:27,369
%ah got problems talk to me I can help
you

815
00:48:27,369 --> 00:48:30,930
but on I was a salesman sorry

816
00:48:30,930 --> 00:48:34,089
home but seriously I think

817
00:48:34,089 --> 00:48:38,470
we have to take responsibility as
customers as users.

818
00:48:38,470 --> 00:48:42,950
as people we have to stop looking at big

819
00:48:42,950 --> 00:48:47,740
daddy whether to cover man be the
hospital over the IT administrator

820
00:48:47,740 --> 00:48:51,670
let's take responsibly I mean this
electronic medical record all

821
00:48:51,670 --> 00:48:55,290
talk then you've been here about the
Google Health when in Google Health

822
00:48:55,290 --> 00:48:58,890
came out because what a mess you know
we're never gonna make it work basically

823
00:48:58,890 --> 00:49:01,279
who wants to mess with earner

824
00:49:01,280 --> 00:49:04,330
so the new approach is

825
00:49:04,330 --> 00:49:07,380
let everybody take care of her own
medical data

826
00:49:07,380 --> 00:49:11,089
and it's fine with interconnect all that
let's make people accountable for their

827
00:49:11,089 --> 00:49:13,910
data so they can keep it so they can
keep it secure so they can

828
00:49:13,910 --> 00:49:17,069
have gone to love it that's the key
we're gonna press

829
00:49:17,069 --> 00:49:20,069
everybody in ball to open up the data

830
00:49:20,069 --> 00:49:23,839
to open up their plans open at the
devices share the information

831
00:49:23,839 --> 00:49:27,299
shared vulnerabilities share the patches

832
00:49:27,300 --> 00:49:30,569
to test how to close at let's engage in
a conversation

833
00:49:30,569 --> 00:49:33,920
let's keep it open that way we can more
faster speed

834
00:49:33,920 --> 00:49:37,280
I mean that's what we've been doing it
internet right I mean

835
00:49:37,280 --> 00:49:41,030
that's why nobody else's to San explore
anymore

836
00:49:41,030 --> 00:49:44,819
all that's what we got a deal are if
somebody is gonna go down the gutter

837
00:49:44,819 --> 00:49:46,720
because when they open their information

838
00:49:46,720 --> 00:49:51,020
we will learn that 200,000 of their
devices failed

839
00:49:51,020 --> 00:49:54,050
and a lot of people died I'm sorry for
them

840
00:49:54,050 --> 00:49:57,430
but that's what we need we need to know
in order to know

841
00:49:57,430 --> 00:50:01,970
me to ask for it because it had gonna
give it to us sawdust person in my eyes

842
00:50:01,970 --> 00:50:02,849
but I'll

843
00:50:02,849 --> 00:50:09,849
leave it open to questions thank you

844
00:50:58,069 --> 00:51:00,288
direct butthead answer

845
00:51:00,289 --> 00:51:07,289
first

846
00:52:10,960 --> 00:52:14,980
yeah I'm you might have heard about this
3d printing blood vessels they've been

847
00:52:14,980 --> 00:52:18,920
insert into a person's body I mean as a
future you bring your own Kim it when

848
00:52:18,920 --> 00:52:19,410
you need it

849
00:52:19,410 --> 00:52:22,859
I most likely won't be able to pay rent
but elicit have it

850
00:52:22,859 --> 00:52:25,799
but this agriculture I agree with you
completely open source that only

851
00:52:25,800 --> 00:52:28,820
software not only opening the
information but opening the hardware

852
00:52:28,820 --> 00:52:33,160
completed agree on there are more
questions bye week

853
00:52:33,160 --> 00:52:36,430
gotta finished so but will be out there
so

854
00:52:36,430 --> 00:52:38,670
would be more to have a talk to any
thank you
