1
00:00:00,020 --> 00:00:03,000
sided we want to go on a tour so

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,109
are me as the soviet ambassador we
started

3
00:00:06,109 --> 00:00:09,190
going to different countries to the
states to france

4
00:00:09,190 --> 00:00:13,070
anywhere %uh US government property no
trespassing

5
00:00:13,070 --> 00:00:17,930
well we didn't bother %ah and I actually
got kicked out of the Disney party

6
00:00:17,930 --> 00:00:23,060
I showed up as a pseudonym ambassador at
the Disney party the Marriott Hotel in

7
00:00:23,060 --> 00:00:25,000
San Diego and he kicked me out it was
really

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,039
a wonderful within a couple of
performances like that

9
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:32,110
a and so we had a couple author

10
00:00:32,110 --> 00:00:35,460
and the season different actor camps and

11
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:39,390
art festivals that was in Holland for
example was really nice

12
00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:42,890
we got inspired by by what was his name

13
00:00:42,890 --> 00:00:47,520
the guy with the domes whatever but
mister for the

14
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:52,989
of course was not a soviet so %uh yeah

15
00:00:52,989 --> 00:00:58,449
you know a and that then in 2009 we
created a second computer game

16
00:00:58,449 --> 00:01:02,170
but back then other we already thought
about

17
00:01:02,170 --> 00:01:05,269
should be go on with the game so should
be go to the next level

18
00:01:05,269 --> 00:01:09,570
and half a different kind of for much to
tell the story

19
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:13,560
so back then we started discussing a lot

20
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:17,299
the state arts a narrative cinema

21
00:01:17,299 --> 00:01:20,790
nowadays and thats what I actually
wanted to well want to tell you

22
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:24,299
today a there he is a fundamental
problem

23
00:01:24,299 --> 00:01:27,780
with traditional

24
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:31,470
narrative cinema as we see it in the
last 100 years

25
00:01:31,470 --> 00:01:35,630
still there's lots of drama about cinema
and the drama

26
00:01:35,630 --> 00:01:39,030
of cinema why okay we

27
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:42,409
at monochrome we like movies movies is

28
00:01:42,409 --> 00:01:46,110
is a great medium are I never ever tried

29
00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:49,430
when I played a computer game but I cry

30
00:01:49,430 --> 00:01:54,049
you know like like 9p when I watch
Titanic can you imagine

31
00:01:54,049 --> 00:01:58,180
are but still I'm I'm just picking that
example

32
00:01:58,180 --> 00:02:01,930
because it's so are horrible and so
obvious at the same time

33
00:02:01,930 --> 00:02:06,750
cinema like books but cinema even more
cinema is a very

34
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:10,330
emotional are medium you

35
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:13,370
embrace you indulge yourself into a

36
00:02:13,370 --> 00:02:17,140
another world another you were to sit
there for two hours and

37
00:02:17,140 --> 00:02:21,330
you let the story guide you in a certain
way an emotional issue

38
00:02:21,330 --> 00:02:26,060
we really liked it so the medium are
this cinema is not dying each

39
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:29,770
its its or a hundred years old but still

40
00:02:29,770 --> 00:02:33,090
its out there the problem we monochrome

41
00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:36,400
always hat with the traditional
narrative cinema

42
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:40,900
arts the early 21st century is the
traditional narrative cinema

43
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:44,629
the 21st century is completely no ring
what's going on

44
00:02:44,629 --> 00:02:48,099
right now in our world and what's
important about it

45
00:02:48,099 --> 00:02:51,920
are I'll show you a movies

46
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:56,220
are about action you need move meant
that the camera

47
00:02:56,220 --> 00:03:00,629
can point at you need action explosions
you need

48
00:03:00,629 --> 00:03:04,079
love scenes you need something that's
happening in order

49
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:07,970
to film it to make it attractive for a
the medium

50
00:03:07,970 --> 00:03:12,069
arts of of cinema the problem now these
is

51
00:03:12,069 --> 00:03:15,650
thats a we live in a world

52
00:03:15,650 --> 00:03:20,239
that he is almost in all the aspects
that are important

53
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:23,420
nowadays completely deprived

54
00:03:23,420 --> 00:03:26,670
of things that can be films what's going
on

55
00:03:26,670 --> 00:03:30,569
it's about the so-called display ability
of what's going on

56
00:03:30,569 --> 00:03:35,260
nowadays are its kinda easy to fool the
computer because the computer is really

57
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:36,548
important nowadays

58
00:03:36,549 --> 00:03:39,840
but its boring why would I film a
computer

59
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:43,049
the important stuff is going on in the
computer

60
00:03:43,049 --> 00:03:46,650
in abstract prostheses that cannot be

61
00:03:46,650 --> 00:03:50,069
the told in in in the

62
00:03:50,069 --> 00:03:53,790
it can be told of course but nobody
wants to tell those stories

63
00:03:53,790 --> 00:03:57,989
so let's go on to next light the
movement I was talking about there's a

64
00:03:57,989 --> 00:03:59,090
really great term

65
00:03:59,090 --> 00:04:02,560
by the French philosopher should lose
any talks about

66
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:05,620
the movement image your needs to film

67
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:09,720
action to make something visible or
interesting

68
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:13,319
in traditional cinema to dish the cinema
is a great

69
00:04:13,319 --> 00:04:16,320
we to also spread ideas

70
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:20,298
so for example I mentioned before
titanic tight end of course

71
00:04:20,298 --> 00:04:23,448
is a multi a million dollar film about

72
00:04:23,449 --> 00:04:27,080
dying people on a ship at the same time
a

73
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:31,550
James Cameron told the story and it's
really important Cameron told the story

74
00:04:31,550 --> 00:04:34,610
about a to different people

75
00:04:34,610 --> 00:04:37,830
in the class structure of the early not
twentieth century

76
00:04:37,830 --> 00:04:41,859
so it's a love story between upper-class
people and lower-class people

77
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:45,440
and that's actually generation of the
film it's not all about

78
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:49,919
the the shipping Heights heightz falling
apart and people are dying

79
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:53,198
the emotional story is this love story
between to

80
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:56,470
members of different classes a so

81
00:04:56,470 --> 00:05:00,100
and that's exactly what I'm talking
about we need stories we need

82
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:04,680
the rations the tell the stories of
what's going on nowadays

83
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:08,740
and the and that's very important

84
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:12,180
filming it a movie about the bank
robbery

85
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:15,330
is pretty easy and it will go on for
every hour

86
00:05:15,330 --> 00:05:19,849
but filming or a creating a movie about
the real crimes

87
00:05:19,850 --> 00:05:23,710
of the 21st century is pretty hard
because the real crimes in the 21st

88
00:05:23,710 --> 00:05:25,630
century look like this

89
00:05:25,630 --> 00:05:28,990
the real crimes are

90
00:05:28,990 --> 00:05:32,410
abstracts

91
00:05:32,410 --> 00:05:35,770
algorithms somewhere in the data systems
of all worlds

92
00:05:35,770 --> 00:05:39,150
that's what's defining what's going on
nowadays

93
00:05:39,150 --> 00:05:43,669
that's what should emotional eyes us but
it's not

94
00:05:43,669 --> 00:05:48,210
going on because nobody is telling those
stories the of course documentaries

95
00:05:48,210 --> 00:05:52,638
their people like The Yes Men trying to
break it down in interest in pizza

96
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:53,680
snippets here

97
00:05:53,680 --> 00:06:00,000
but still we need more movie it's
because movies are a mass medium

98
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,220
an emotional mass medium to tell this
story of that climb

99
00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:08,669
what's going on a there are hardly any
movies

100
00:06:08,669 --> 00:06:11,960
at means like they're almost a billion
people using Facebook

101
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:15,539
why there is almost no Facebook or
interaction

102
00:06:15,539 --> 00:06:18,979
on social networks like Facebook in
movies of course

103
00:06:18,979 --> 00:06:22,740
to a certain extent that's boring its
weren't filming Facebook are you

104
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:26,300
end up with a the suit or something
because you film

105
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:29,419
website and you don't know what every a
a but it

106
00:06:29,419 --> 00:06:33,818
what I mean is that a

107
00:06:33,819 --> 00:06:38,819
this story's a polywood are still the
same that were told in the 1920s

108
00:06:38,819 --> 00:06:42,160
what the fuck what's going on it should
be

109
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:47,710
in New a rough right now of movie makers
and filmmakers and creative people

110
00:06:47,710 --> 00:06:50,979
who take the everyday life the Libyan

111
00:06:50,979 --> 00:06:54,810
enemy my life is sixty percent online
your

112
00:06:54,810 --> 00:06:58,750
why is that not shown of course it's
hard of course you have to find special

113
00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:00,720
ways to tell those stories

114
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:05,599
maybe it's a fairy tale maybe it's a
table or something of course

115
00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:09,330
those a abstracts at sixth form it's
your

116
00:07:09,330 --> 00:07:12,699
they can't be reduced to a

117
00:07:12,699 --> 00:07:16,660
like a simple filming what's going on
doesn't work that way your

118
00:07:16,660 --> 00:07:20,690
but there's so many creative people out
there why is there no creative

119
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:23,860
a this course about

120
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:27,530
Hall to tell the stories of the 21st
century

121
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:32,590
so we need to tell all those love
stories and crimes and dramas

122
00:07:32,590 --> 00:07:36,800
ever actually abstract but here other

123
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:40,280
beer actually trading our lives and we
create them so how

124
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:44,580
can we do that Erie is a quote from the
internationally it's called

125
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:48,909
to be nothing don't carry it any longer
and to a certain extent

126
00:07:48,910 --> 00:07:53,050
I think that's true person

127
00:07:53,050 --> 00:07:58,069
because the traditional narrative cinema
is getting more and more obsolete

128
00:07:58,069 --> 00:08:02,660
over the years and to that that's bad

129
00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:05,870
ranked nice guy I hope you like him a

130
00:08:05,870 --> 00:08:10,150
in the 1920s 1930s he actually said
something really true

131
00:08:10,150 --> 00:08:13,440
he said that image

132
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:16,699
are a factory a crook factory

133
00:08:16,699 --> 00:08:20,639
does not explain how the factory of
croup is working age

134
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:24,069
and that's exactly what I'm talking
about filming a computer is not

135
00:08:24,069 --> 00:08:26,039
explaining how the computer works

136
00:08:26,039 --> 00:08:30,669
filming The Wall Street bull is not
explaining how wall street works

137
00:08:30,669 --> 00:08:35,789
are we need to find ways to make those
abstract things

138
00:08:35,789 --> 00:08:39,169
grasp the full for regular people out
there

139
00:08:39,169 --> 00:08:42,789
who wanna cry about it she it wanna cry
about that stuff why didn't like wanna

140
00:08:42,789 --> 00:08:44,199
cry about Titanic

141
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:47,370
but there is no one trying to make that
start

142
00:08:47,370 --> 00:08:51,940
accessible for them and endure talking
about ek hits and stuff like that

143
00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:55,040
it's true to a certain extent because
there are no

144
00:08:55,040 --> 00:09:00,380
people out there trying to to pack all
that complex material

145
00:09:00,380 --> 00:09:03,959
into interesting stories that people
want to consume and I'm really seeing

146
00:09:03,959 --> 00:09:08,120
want to consume good all those stories

147
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:11,769
have to be like modeled in remodeled

148
00:09:11,769 --> 00:09:15,529
and sheep in a certain way I think many
people out there head by these about

149
00:09:15,529 --> 00:09:16,480
that I think that

150
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:20,170
you should write a screenplays and not
the guys in

151
00:09:20,170 --> 00:09:23,729
a in Hollywood or at least you should be
advisers for those guys

152
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:28,640
in hauled aboard a I mean the film about
Facebook was pretty much a case like two

153
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:29,500
years ago

154
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:35,040
but it's a film abouts P much the
rivalry with two guys

155
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:39,620
it's not telling a lot about how global
capital is now I these works

156
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:42,790
and why Facebook is so big now a days
okay

157
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:48,149
so be aware and that's why I'm telling
you this story because we

158
00:09:48,149 --> 00:09:51,839
two years ago three years ago we decided
that you want it right

159
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:55,380
because nobody tries it so why not we
let's start with it

160
00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:59,250
so you have to be aware if you want to
make a movie

161
00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:03,490
you easily sell your soul movies I B
complex

162
00:10:03,490 --> 00:10:07,950
process ease you need a lot of money you
need many many people working on it

163
00:10:07,950 --> 00:10:11,839
and over course you can probably easily
lose

164
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:15,029
the track you you probably

165
00:10:15,029 --> 00:10:18,160
fail doing it but that's not stories not

166
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:21,800
to do it %ah there's the danger are

167
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:26,279
getting investors who don't understand
what you doing here it is is the problem

168
00:10:26,279 --> 00:10:28,660
that some investors might 212

169
00:10:28,660 --> 00:10:32,010
to a to break down your

170
00:10:32,010 --> 00:10:35,660
your your message into more consumer for
Mitt

171
00:10:35,660 --> 00:10:40,160
are there'd be many problems there the
problems of that some stuff is actually

172
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:42,170
really hard to display

173
00:10:42,170 --> 00:10:46,310
but a we were thinking about thats

174
00:10:46,310 --> 00:10:49,579
when we came to the end are a

175
00:10:49,579 --> 00:10:53,209
the computer games we did about so
getting the superstores and we said

176
00:10:53,209 --> 00:10:58,140
why not taking dislike crazy idea of the
soviet the to the store guys in the

177
00:10:58,140 --> 00:10:59,439
middle of nowhere

178
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:03,529
and using that as the basic setup to
tell a story

179
00:11:03,529 --> 00:11:08,019
about the digital each about the 21st
century century revolutions

180
00:11:08,019 --> 00:11:11,350
and the stuff that's driving society are
but

181
00:11:11,350 --> 00:11:14,600
the nobody tells movies about that wanna
taking these

182
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:18,279
obsolete soviets people

183
00:11:18,279 --> 00:11:21,730
and make them see if the world of the
21st century

184
00:11:21,730 --> 00:11:25,170
that's pretty much what be a what it
right cyl

185
00:11:25,170 --> 00:11:28,319
the film is called 0 zulu and

186
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:31,920
it's actually not about the soviet guys

187
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:35,269
but the so the guys are very important
in the film but it's about the United

188
00:11:35,269 --> 00:11:35,850
Nations

189
00:11:35,850 --> 00:11:39,260
because the united nations we thought is
really important

190
00:11:39,260 --> 00:11:43,970
fieger a in global politics but at the
same time

191
00:11:43,970 --> 00:11:48,269
it's the big failure of global politics
I'm so happy that the UN exists

192
00:11:48,269 --> 00:11:54,220
but at the same time the UN it's so many
things wrong hit their existence

193
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:57,660
but I can't even start the talking where

194
00:11:57,660 --> 00:12:01,480
okie so what we did is we create its

195
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:05,269
a united nations camp between the free
world's

196
00:12:05,269 --> 00:12:09,519
and the soviets and that's the camp that
is pretty much like the mean

197
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:13,690
the main characters in the film I those
United Nations guys sitting in the camp

198
00:12:13,690 --> 00:12:17,089
and they have nothing to do really
nothing

199
00:12:17,089 --> 00:12:20,610
for example that guy that the Scot

200
00:12:20,610 --> 00:12:24,010
that the Scottish UN soldier he built
himself

201
00:12:24,010 --> 00:12:27,850
his own whirlpool love like it he just
like dug a hole in the mud

202
00:12:27,850 --> 00:12:31,279
and for the barrel into it then heats it

203
00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:35,490
and has like it a he's got like the
maker in the film and he

204
00:12:35,490 --> 00:12:39,440
remade his back to clean as a yes the
bubbles in the whirlpool

205
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:42,470
so that's what they're doing for five
years they're sitting there

206
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:46,360
nothing to do for them and they're only
they're because

207
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:51,070
well they have problems have authority
they're drunk arts the

208
00:12:51,070 --> 00:12:54,600
the it some shit is nothing costs upon
the we want to talk about the

209
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:58,000
so that's why they are there and he
never ever saw a single

210
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,320
soviet so they're just a year and to

211
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:04,430
doing their job which is doing nothing

212
00:13:04,430 --> 00:13:07,910
are but suddenly

213
00:13:07,910 --> 00:13:11,000
in the beginning of the film there's a
giant explosion

214
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,010
on the rise in the Soviet countries so
getting the superstores

215
00:13:14,010 --> 00:13:17,470
and that's when the story starts so the
yen guys have to find out

216
00:13:17,470 --> 00:13:21,389
what is going on for the first time ever
to have to do their job

217
00:13:21,389 --> 00:13:24,639
and its that's actually pretty treaty
for them

218
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:28,820
it's a film I can tell you anything more

219
00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:32,170
it's a bizarre conspiracy about
industrial is pure Nash

220
00:13:32,170 --> 00:13:36,480
media madness political intrigue and it
ends up with the soviets

221
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:39,800
saving the digital future of of
mankind's

222
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:42,850
are well that sounds 3d

223
00:13:42,850 --> 00:13:45,990
crazy but actually it works out are

224
00:13:45,990 --> 00:13:49,699
couple of the storyboards going to show
you that guy a

225
00:13:49,699 --> 00:13:53,110
is the one cosmonaut the health who

226
00:13:53,110 --> 00:13:56,310
will never ever fly to space by the way
a

227
00:13:56,310 --> 00:14:00,430
that's the train the really like to
train

228
00:14:00,430 --> 00:14:04,810
it's called categorical imperative now
yeah what that one at the one

229
00:14:04,810 --> 00:14:11,730
athletes the house the one athlete and
the one skyscraper to have

230
00:14:11,730 --> 00:14:16,110
so you think what what's what's going on
white the really like backwards why can

231
00:14:16,110 --> 00:14:17,310
be safe the world's

232
00:14:17,310 --> 00:14:20,600
and at all the spoiler lot

233
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:23,639
your but over time you find out

234
00:14:23,639 --> 00:14:27,250
that those soviet sexually understand
the we

235
00:14:27,250 --> 00:14:30,639
that the digital world works way better

236
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:34,540
then the media conglomerates United
States

237
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:38,540
the espionage sure people whoever so
they kinda like

238
00:14:38,540 --> 00:14:41,699
the beer like the hackers of the 21st
century

239
00:14:41,699 --> 00:14:45,779
and only because utopia field so be

240
00:14:45,779 --> 00:14:50,540
in the 1990s that the soviet dream
collapsed because it was like a whale

241
00:14:50,540 --> 00:14:51,829
that's trend it's

242
00:14:51,829 --> 00:14:57,339
on the beach and killed itself only
because they're so unimportant nowadays

243
00:14:57,339 --> 00:15:02,399
the haft is like a lil remaining utopia
left in their soul that he can finally

244
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:05,839
a can like play out their triumph

245
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:09,180
and at the trump card and the

246
00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:13,360
n&C ther NC all our future including

hopefully be interested in case you want
to donate some money be a Kickstarter

318
00:20:11,260 --> 00:20:14,360

you also get up if you like you get a
felony

323
00:20:29,170 --> 00:20:33,020

325
00:20:36,470 --> 00:20:39,720
but you can still do it if you like are
and

326
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:43,620
if you and if you paid the top the
top-level

327
00:20:43,620 --> 00:20:47,010
you not only get a party a communist
party you also get

328
00:20:47,010 --> 00:20:50,510
are me eating it a pint of my own blood

329
00:20:50,510 --> 00:20:57,510
soap yup

330
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:02,350
it's for that Western plutocrats

331
00:21:02,350 --> 00:21:05,919
who like it decadents report yes I'll
eat my own blood

332
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:10,070
yes it's a it's good %ah so

333
00:21:10,070 --> 00:21:13,360
we need heroines and a hero's

334
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:17,179
to finish all that crap %ah in the
personal

335
00:21:17,179 --> 00:21:21,850
the conversation I can tell a little bit
more about the secrets of soup in a

336
00:21:21,850 --> 00:21:23,230
superstar and the film

337
00:21:23,230 --> 00:21:26,499
because I don't really want that on film
right now

338
00:21:26,499 --> 00:21:29,950
because it's kinda spoiling a little bit
but still are

339
00:21:29,950 --> 00:21:34,460
our re low-interest in doing that whole
project ES

340
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:37,980
taking really silly story as

341
00:21:37,980 --> 00:21:41,499
a s that the medium to deliver

342
00:21:41,499 --> 00:21:45,210
a pretty serious message so we want to
talk about intellectual property

343
00:21:45,210 --> 00:21:49,119
wanna talk about are the way he's the
power elites work

344
00:21:49,119 --> 00:21:54,320
on the planet the Wii how international
relationships are dominated by corporal

345
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:58,178
the corporation's and the and where is
strong

346
00:21:58,179 --> 00:22:01,519
key figures on the planet so because I
want to break down

347
00:22:01,519 --> 00:22:05,740
the network structure of the power
elites project that onto

348
00:22:05,740 --> 00:22:09,259
so in order to restore from the small UN
camp and tell

349
00:22:09,259 --> 00:22:13,159
a stable or tell a fairy tale about
what's going wrong

350
00:22:13,159 --> 00:22:16,259
nowadays and how we can probably fix it

351
00:22:16,259 --> 00:22:19,929
so thats that's our our our peak

352
00:22:19,929 --> 00:22:23,360
goal I hope we will succeed doing that

353
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:26,460
but the good thing is a couple of people

354
00:22:26,460 --> 00:22:30,350
a really really interested in helping us
I mention them individual

355
00:22:30,350 --> 00:22:33,619
Robert Picardo who was the hologram
doctor on Star Trek

356
00:22:33,619 --> 00:22:38,480
he will the the the supreme soviet up so
within the superstores

357
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:41,759
less a with the Yes Men in there with
the really

358
00:22:41,759 --> 00:22:45,919
small and nice appearance will have

359
00:22:45,919 --> 00:22:50,090
all the other guys Jello Biafra as a
decade and US diplomat and

360
00:22:50,090 --> 00:22:53,709
stuff at so and that's only the people I
can talk about because we have more

361
00:22:53,710 --> 00:22:56,590
people but the one that signed a
contract first but that's why we need

362
00:22:56,590 --> 00:22:57,320
some money

363
00:22:57,320 --> 00:23:01,059
a in fact the film ES pashley

364
00:23:01,059 --> 00:23:05,918
a subsidized a by the Austin government
so we got a grant by the Austrian

365
00:23:05,919 --> 00:23:06,690
government

366
00:23:06,690 --> 00:23:10,480
to film the film because of course we
asked for fifty thousand dollars on

367
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:11,129
Kickstarter

368
00:23:11,129 --> 00:23:14,759
you cannot do a shoot for fifty thousand
dollars six especially not a film that

369
00:23:14,759 --> 00:23:15,809
we plan to do

370
00:23:15,809 --> 00:23:18,850
but the good thing is is that with the

371
00:23:18,850 --> 00:23:23,389
Kickstarter money and the grant money
from Austria we can apply for the next

372
00:23:23,389 --> 00:23:24,889
level France and Germany

373
00:23:24,889 --> 00:23:28,230
are and with that money in Germany we
can actually make

374
00:23:28,230 --> 00:23:33,500
the movie happening and film it next
March so we have a pretty tight schedule

375
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:36,940
so in case you want to help us are
please do so

376
00:23:36,940 --> 00:23:40,440
I have a shitload our flyers a

377
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:43,799
actually 2500 I think I'll probably

378
00:23:43,799 --> 00:23:48,559
I dunno out burned them something later
on because I'll never

379
00:23:48,559 --> 00:23:51,869
be able to use all of them but the smell
good I mean it's

380
00:23:51,869 --> 00:23:56,269
as a good thing you're so I think I've
talked

381
00:23:56,269 --> 00:23:59,570
too much already I'll switch to

382
00:23:59,570 --> 00:24:03,820
the social media info actually should be
socialist media

383
00:24:03,820 --> 00:24:10,769
yeah are and a I would like to open that
the panel so if you have questions for

384
00:24:10,769 --> 00:24:11,340
me

385
00:24:11,340 --> 00:24:15,629
police cool ahead and I will hand over
the microphone because that's actually

386
00:24:15,629 --> 00:24:16,059
the

387
00:24:16,059 --> 00:24:23,059
the question questioning microphone you

388
00:24:24,359 --> 00:24:31,359
we I'll use that one

389
00:24:35,879 --> 00:24:42,879
okay okay sir tell us how you're trying
to get away with

390
00:24:48,379 --> 00:24:51,570
get away from that problem how you think
other people in hollywood could do a

391
00:24:51,570 --> 00:24:53,928
better job at certain capturing stuff it
doesn't

392
00:24:53,929 --> 00:24:57,499
look at my speech I mean you're not yeah
thanks thanks quick question

393
00:24:57,499 --> 00:25:01,109
I think it's not the problem that it's
not possible the problem is the people

394
00:25:01,109 --> 00:25:02,049
don't wanna do it

395
00:25:02,049 --> 00:25:06,450
and I don't know why %ah if that stuff
shows up

396
00:25:06,450 --> 00:25:09,960
it's always I mean it's quite
interesting days one

397
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:14,609
film in the last twenty years that
really used the whole element is a key

398
00:25:14,609 --> 00:25:15,710
element

399
00:25:15,710 --> 00:25:19,809
and thats dislike should be one with the
with tomahawks

400
00:25:19,809 --> 00:25:23,629
a Tom Tom Hanks and and get that you may
like that this love story about the

401
00:25:23,629 --> 00:25:25,240
email which is kinda like

402
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:29,690
the copy pic huh you've got mail yes
been copy paste it is like nineteenth

403
00:25:29,690 --> 00:25:31,200
century idea

404
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:36,279
are like a a at this like letter novels
for something I don't I'm not

405
00:25:36,279 --> 00:25:39,500
not a scholar a Victorian literature but
he took that

406
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:43,889
ID year and transferred into the present
and just like exchanged letters with

407
00:25:43,889 --> 00:25:45,190
emails

408
00:25:45,190 --> 00:25:48,740
ended it's a good idea I have to see and
it was nice film

409
00:25:48,740 --> 00:25:51,990
but that can't be aight I a

410
00:25:51,990 --> 00:25:55,039
there is a so many people do stuff for
example that

411
00:25:55,039 --> 00:25:58,539
I'm I'm always talking about James
Cameron why do I do that are

412
00:25:58,539 --> 00:26:02,169
James Cameron's last one avatar was
really shitty

413
00:26:02,169 --> 00:26:06,629
but at least he made the point of that
he doesn't like exploitation

414
00:26:06,629 --> 00:26:10,299
I don't like exploitation of indigenous
populations

415
00:26:10,299 --> 00:26:14,690
that's very much like the content of the
whole film up

416
00:26:14,690 --> 00:26:17,950
and that's very i mean a a film is
pretty much

417
00:26:17,950 --> 00:26:21,480
short story a fifteen or twenty pages

418
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:25,649
put into a different medium input on
this on onto the screen so the contents

419
00:26:25,649 --> 00:26:28,809
of the film can't be too complex

420
00:26:28,809 --> 00:26:32,769
but still I think there he is Tom a
possibility out the year

421
00:26:32,769 --> 00:26:36,619
to take interesting stories that are
beyond

422
00:26:36,619 --> 00:26:41,619
the Robin Hood films of the twenties
forty 70s 80s 90s and present

423
00:26:41,619 --> 00:26:44,809
up and go ahead and use that I'm

424
00:26:44,809 --> 00:26:48,590
in our case we are always a we think
that

425
00:26:48,590 --> 00:26:51,619
the Wii to use a grotesque up

426
00:26:51,619 --> 00:26:54,960
fantasy setting setting or or a comedy

427
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:58,549
is very accommodating for the idea
because you can be very

428
00:26:58,549 --> 00:27:01,940
specific about that at the same time you
can be funny you can

429
00:27:01,940 --> 00:27:05,960
you don't have to be too detailed about
is to stop really possible but then be

430
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:07,889
at the sci-fi aspect that

431
00:27:07,889 --> 00:27:12,609
lift stuff away from that so they're
tired of possibilities and I don't know

432
00:27:12,609 --> 00:27:13,509
why

433
00:27:13,509 --> 00:27:17,539
more people are seen that market and the
market is definitely up there

434
00:27:17,539 --> 00:27:20,710
I mean nerds are mainstream culture
holidays

435
00:27:20,710 --> 00:27:23,980
why a I I wanted to film

436
00:27:23,980 --> 00:27:28,389
dead some guy who's fourteen years old
and coming to hope can see

437
00:27:28,389 --> 00:27:32,330
and enjoy the same way at my knees
60-year-old mother

438
00:27:32,330 --> 00:27:36,389
would enjoy you see there is there is no
reason why there shouldn't be

439
00:27:36,389 --> 00:27:40,879
a common ground for all those things
because the 14 year old guy

440
00:27:40,879 --> 00:27:45,349
is affected in the same way by digital
politics out there like my mother

441
00:27:45,349 --> 00:27:49,059
my mother just doesn't know about it she
has to be told in a way that she can

442
00:27:49,059 --> 00:27:49,730
understand

443
00:27:49,730 --> 00:27:52,879
I think yeah

444
00:27:52,879 --> 00:27:56,889
I hope by my long answer was not
derailed

445
00:27:56,889 --> 00:28:00,799
sales arm I think I have an answer to
that

446
00:28:00,799 --> 00:28:04,470
okay it has to do you with something
I've knows I'm

447
00:28:04,470 --> 00:28:08,029
asked you to you but I've lived here for
a while so I've had

448
00:28:08,029 --> 00:28:11,429
its you know opportunity to compare okay
and

449
00:28:11,429 --> 00:28:15,509
one of the things I've noticed is
there's a system here

450
00:28:15,509 --> 00:28:19,820
and it's very old and I believe what's
taking place here

451
00:28:19,820 --> 00:28:25,720
is arm a generational sealing the glass
ceiling a generation ceiling

452
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:28,759
I'm let's take James Cameron for example

453
00:28:28,759 --> 00:28:33,399
his generation I don't believe that's
the generation that uses

454
00:28:33,399 --> 00:28:37,970
the media to that extent to the extent
that younger people do

455
00:28:37,970 --> 00:28:42,330
and but they're in charge and similar
things take place in the educational

456
00:28:42,330 --> 00:28:43,168
level

457
00:28:43,169 --> 00:28:48,240
the political level and I I think that's
a big part of it

458
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:53,889
aside from that subject matter like that
anything that has to do with socialism

459
00:28:53,889 --> 00:28:57,029
is pretty much outlined here I see

460
00:28:57,029 --> 00:29:00,450
in our case we we took this like
completely

461
00:29:00,450 --> 00:29:03,609
obsolete Ste communist state structure

462
00:29:03,609 --> 00:29:07,220
because we thought it's a perfect

463
00:29:07,220 --> 00:29:10,399
it's a perfect way to tell the story
because people

464
00:29:10,399 --> 00:29:15,039
20 hear about this so with micro state
the of course immediately left

465
00:29:15,039 --> 00:29:20,549
escalate so at so absurd we don't have
to take it serious but i think thats

466
00:29:20,549 --> 00:29:23,929
that's it great way to we have like
malware

467
00:29:23,929 --> 00:29:27,590
embedded into that stuff it's like the
payloads it's a

468
00:29:27,590 --> 00:29:31,329
yet the format is absurd informant is
like what the fuck hahahaha

469
00:29:31,329 --> 00:29:34,359
but the payload the content a this is

470
00:29:34,359 --> 00:29:37,918
wonderful quote by mile a I'm not a big
mouth and I have to say

471
00:29:37,919 --> 00:29:40,940
but he says we need sugar-coated bullets

472
00:29:40,940 --> 00:29:43,980
and I think a sugar-coated ball that is
exactly what we need

473
00:29:43,980 --> 00:29:47,159
we need to tell political interesting
stories

474
00:29:47,159 --> 00:29:50,200
in a way that they're easily consumable
and even find

475
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:54,010
yeah I love the idea but the
relationship to the Soviet Union's Louis

476
00:29:54,010 --> 00:29:57,250
different here I think than what we
experience Europe

477
00:29:57,250 --> 00:30:00,250
yeah I would have reminded me up a
little bit too was

478
00:30:00,250 --> 00:30:04,059
as two picks in relax with the goals in
the rooms

479
00:30:04,059 --> 00:30:07,399
definitely definitely very European
thing I've met Americans who have never

480
00:30:07,399 --> 00:30:09,210
heard of Asterix which is kinda

481
00:30:09,210 --> 00:30:13,119
shoot yourself a but then again

482
00:30:13,119 --> 00:30:16,750
it makes sense because Asterix from a
political level

483
00:30:16,750 --> 00:30:22,139
s3x came up in nineteen sixties and it's
heavily based in grounded

484
00:30:22,139 --> 00:30:25,519
in French anti-americanism of the
nineteen sixties of course

485
00:30:25,519 --> 00:30:29,109
s3x is film about the goals

486
00:30:29,109 --> 00:30:32,649
to fight against the Romans but of
course it's france fighting

487
00:30:32,649 --> 00:30:36,409
a domination by america so your stay

488
00:30:36,409 --> 00:30:39,909
even s3x s3x a very political story

489
00:30:39,909 --> 00:30:43,700
at least it was in the beginning and
then it kinda tried out have to see

490
00:30:43,700 --> 00:30:47,839
and I'm not in favor of anti-americanism
have to see

491
00:30:47,839 --> 00:30:51,940
that's bullshit yeah

492
00:30:51,940 --> 00:30:55,119
now really really because
anti-americanism always ends up in is

493
00:30:55,119 --> 00:30:58,059
like crazy anti-semitism like the East
Coast

494
00:30:58,059 --> 00:31:01,349
jus running the role in all that
bullshit it's theirs there's really

495
00:31:01,349 --> 00:31:02,470
there's an upcoming

496
00:31:02,470 --> 00:31:06,070
a leftist critique in Europe

497
00:31:06,070 --> 00:31:09,960
and they're almost like the almost sound
like beer they're not since

498
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:13,480
because the Jews around the world
probable

499
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:16,659
a course that's happening here too but
there's an there's a

500
00:31:16,659 --> 00:31:20,450
there's a tendency in in European
countries to be very

501
00:31:20,450 --> 00:31:25,329
enter in america a Andy think you're
entitled but no they're only

502
00:31:25,329 --> 00:31:26,899
anti-american the only

503
00:31:26,899 --> 00:31:30,649
their stupid anti-semitic they're not
criticizing capital because the

504
00:31:30,649 --> 00:31:35,169
don't he can't even grasp how global
capitalism is working you cannot take

505
00:31:35,169 --> 00:31:38,389
global capitalism and find a scapegoat
for

506
00:31:38,389 --> 00:31:42,700
I mean I'm part of kept me all part of
capitalism that's the problem of it

507
00:31:42,700 --> 00:31:45,919
it's not you can find the five people
who are

508
00:31:45,919 --> 00:31:49,470
in charge of that the world's bat we are
all part of it

509
00:31:49,470 --> 00:31:54,000
that's that's the bit disillusionment I
F

510
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:57,099
I've discovered last couple years okie

511
00:31:57,099 --> 00:32:02,960
