1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,869
up security for drinking water because I
come up a background as a

2
00:00:03,870 --> 00:00:06,970
water Commissioner for thirteen years in
Massachusetts

3
00:00:06,970 --> 00:00:10,910
are my day job is %uh

4
00:00:10,910 --> 00:00:14,809
is doing it. tech support and so on in
mine non day job the

5
00:00:14,809 --> 00:00:18,539
with be nice to turn to a gay jobs is
security research quote-unquote

6
00:00:18,539 --> 00:00:22,619
I was a former lobbyist for in violation
see an environmental

7
00:00:22,619 --> 00:00:26,320
a group up a beginning talks at here

8
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:30,570
and a duck on black cat in the churros
on the road this is my seventh talk this

9
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:31,609
year god help me

10
00:00:31,609 --> 00:00:37,090
are speaking yeah spoke on drinking
water infrastructure security at three

11
00:00:37,090 --> 00:00:40,790
locations God a wireless water meter up

12
00:00:40,790 --> 00:00:43,829
at two locations talk a virtually tap
konnen

13
00:00:43,829 --> 00:00:48,500
like at last year and a given earlier
version of this talk a thought Khan in

14
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:50,920
Chicago but this is the much improved
version

15
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:56,260
arm and I've written some articles based
upon my water department experience

16
00:00:56,260 --> 00:00:59,339
I'll in the journal throwing the Water
Works Association

17
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:03,260
and my black cat I'll white paper

18
00:01:03,260 --> 00:01:07,280
on wireless water meters actually the
part of it that was on

19
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:10,409
general drinking water arm a security

20
00:01:10,409 --> 00:01:14,260
was published in the book weapons of
mass destruction terrorism

21
00:01:14,260 --> 00:01:18,000
a second edition om which came out
earlier this year

22
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,520
which is used as a text book a universal
all I think also at West Point

23
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:25,979
are so I'm trying to and developing my
expertise in

24
00:01:25,979 --> 00:01:30,079
writing on these matters so just talk
actually came outta my research

25
00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:34,640
originally talk to someone earlier I
give a talk at Def Con 2010 on general

26
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:38,610
drinking water infrastructure security
and

27
00:01:38,610 --> 00:01:42,229
that led to my talk last year on white
water meter security

28
00:01:42,229 --> 00:01:45,350
or lack thereof and and hack ability

29
00:01:45,350 --> 00:01:48,810
while its water meters when they become
prevalent and that led to this talk

30
00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:49,600
which is

31
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:53,159
should have a further fine-grained way
finding out how to use water

32
00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:56,729
in your home another activities in your
home arm

33
00:01:56,729 --> 00:02:01,670
so arm the outline basically is

34
00:02:01,670 --> 00:02:05,469
I have to mention at I did some research
on the tele screen now I look for a

35
00:02:05,469 --> 00:02:07,369
picture from the original show

36
00:02:07,369 --> 00:02:11,140
this is sort of an IA out adj inside
joke to the prisoner

37
00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:14,550
it's Patrick McGoohan playing a former
secret agent for those who don't know

38
00:02:14,550 --> 00:02:18,260
who when he resigned she should have
kidnapped and brought to

39
00:02:18,260 --> 00:02:22,220
the village which is beautiful little
town in an island or

40
00:02:22,220 --> 00:02:25,780
somewhere no one really knows where it
is and it's like a gilded cage is

41
00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:28,020
beautiful everyone's dressed nicely this

42
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:32,040
was an activities but this 24-hour
around-the-clock

43
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:35,099
total surveillance just like right now

44
00:02:35,099 --> 00:02:39,849
in the US arm and but his I try to find
a follow this but this artist was the

45
00:02:39,849 --> 00:02:40,890
only thing they had it so

46
00:02:40,890 --> 00:02:44,470
so for his private residence
quote-unquote it says private which a

47
00:02:44,470 --> 00:02:45,650
corset isn't

48
00:02:45,650 --> 00:02:48,800
because they can see and hear everything
he does and everything

49
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:51,910
you know in and everything he you know
and everyone else

50
00:02:51,910 --> 00:02:55,440
so that was sort of just the inside joke
arm

51
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:58,609
number six I'm not a number I'm a free
man

52
00:02:58,610 --> 00:03:01,640
et cetera so arm before get the

53
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:05,430
more infrastructure mediated sensing the
actual topic

54
00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:09,700
up the talk I wanted to give some brief
introduction privacy

55
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:13,090
I'll all warn you that that's what is so
to take over because

56
00:03:13,090 --> 00:03:16,200
the slaughter by the talks that might be
go into more detail

57
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:19,959
over threats to privacy these days but
I'm it hit a couple key things

58
00:03:19,959 --> 00:03:24,500
to look at outside the home what privacy
do we have in what threats there are

59
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:27,760
and I'll talk about this technology
which is inside the home

60
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:31,579
so the tele screen this is from the
movie

61
00:03:31,580 --> 00:03:34,599
wars peace freedom is slavery ignorance
is strength

62
00:03:34,599 --> 00:03:38,640
%uh as you may know from the book and
the movie detail screen is a two-way

63
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:42,310
video %uh that it really explain the
book with technology was it didn't

64
00:03:42,310 --> 00:03:43,080
really matter

65
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:47,739
arm work which can see everything in
with the Smiths homebody found this

66
00:03:47,739 --> 00:03:48,980
little corner worst part

67
00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:53,340
where he thought they couldn't see a man
here he found out later course that they

68
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:56,400
course are things going so

69
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:00,439
the tele screen has been developed I
Apple has a patent for art

70
00:04:00,439 --> 00:04:05,459
I want read every slide I a course %uh
by: how's it different than a a video

71
00:04:05,459 --> 00:04:07,540
screen on a laptop with the

72
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:11,769
with camera well it's the real video
screen so they've got the

73
00:04:11,769 --> 00:04:15,349
the view the view a bowl know that the
video receiver

74
00:04:15,349 --> 00:04:18,530
is integrated in with the the output so

75
00:04:18,530 --> 00:04:22,100
so you don't know there's a camera with
these and

76
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:25,949
up my understanding is that sharp %uh is
coming out with some

77
00:04:25,949 --> 00:04:29,110
some that are similar to that as well so

78
00:04:29,110 --> 00:04:32,490
are I could find information that Apple
was actually coming over that we know

79
00:04:32,490 --> 00:04:33,550
the Apple TV

80
00:04:33,550 --> 00:04:37,110
might be coming are I don't know whether
it's the same thing

81
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:40,780
so that the point is that ap you know
from George Orwell sorta

82
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:44,259
coming up with to it as a without trying
to design deter actually say would

83
00:04:44,259 --> 00:04:45,080
happen

84
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:48,550
it was a device in the book arm it's
it's something that

85
00:04:48,550 --> 00:04:52,610
is is on its way it's not here already

86
00:04:52,610 --> 00:04:57,009
answer privacy is under attack so here's
number six being chased by Rover

87
00:04:57,009 --> 00:05:00,330
so in the village where those cameras
everywhere in in

88
00:05:00,330 --> 00:05:04,370
and microphones everywhere whenever you
do something that you're not supposed to

89
00:05:04,370 --> 00:05:08,300
rover appears out of nowhere in that
I'll explain what rover is but it is big

90
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:13,060
which weather balloon competent has a
life of its own its is alive or is it

91
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:17,460
I mean what is it president charge than
a smothers you wake up in a real jail

92
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:19,039
cell and god knows you know than

93
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:22,500
than they really start to work on you so
arm and there's another

94
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:26,780
was on again there's a lot of talks this
conference about privacy some blood to

95
00:05:26,780 --> 00:05:27,639
add to that

96
00:05:27,639 --> 00:05:31,410
total weight above discussion on it and
that hit some things

97
00:05:31,410 --> 00:05:34,789
and the high points before I get to the
main topic to talk

98
00:05:34,789 --> 00:05:38,710
but who was watching who wasn't watching
is is a good question

99
00:05:38,710 --> 00:05:42,060
so while I just throughout this new
speak definition

100
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:45,560
course in the news big dictionary there
would be no word privacy the last one

101
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:46,820
number five

102
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:49,990
arm but it's interesting you read
privacidade the

103
00:05:49,990 --> 00:05:52,990
disclosures on some web sites and it

104
00:05:52,990 --> 00:05:56,800
summer them there's some some of them
actually say that includes collecting

105
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:57,850
data on you

106
00:05:57,850 --> 00:06:01,060
or your your you're agreeing that data
will be collected

107
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:04,410
arm so arm d

108
00:06:04,410 --> 00:06:08,120
the definition a privacy that
institutions and businesses

109
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:11,949
are are coming up with is certainly
could be different than what

110
00:06:11,949 --> 00:06:16,630
most people think it our cameras I was
in Chicago for talk on a few months ago

111
00:06:16,630 --> 00:06:17,509
and I didn't see

112
00:06:17,509 --> 00:06:20,810
lots of cameras but according to our
study

113
00:06:20,810 --> 00:06:25,949
by ACLU they've 10,000 or they're
working on getting ten thousand that RB

114
00:06:25,949 --> 00:06:29,160
wall the wall to the city arm

115
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:32,280
and the objective is to cover city from
one end to the other

116
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:35,690
up so that's up so above

117
00:06:35,690 --> 00:06:39,060
that this is a generic pictures on the
internet up for surveillance cameras

118
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:42,220
and this is want the cameras at the in
the village

119
00:06:42,220 --> 00:06:46,160
are numbered I'm gonna be pop the
village references be popping in and out

120
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:46,930
here

121
00:06:46,930 --> 00:06:50,259
on my favorite soda analogy to work I
mean

122
00:06:50,259 --> 00:06:53,550
were we all over the bill it right arm
so

123
00:06:53,550 --> 00:06:57,470
is many other cities that are are
covering a cameras wall to wall and kick

124
00:06:57,470 --> 00:07:01,580
almost anywhere without a surveillance
camera run to 711 or school or

125
00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:04,219
institution or police station

126
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:08,000
on in urine a private facilities in the
camera

127
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,680
and arts OECD its on public in in in
popular movies you see a lot of places

128
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:16,639
where they hack into the camera and they
find you when they can follow you around

129
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:20,560
arm which probably could happen but but
the point is all those

130
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:24,449
this visual information is being
collected and some other may

131
00:07:24,449 --> 00:07:28,030
right over the information or or not
stored but

132
00:07:28,030 --> 00:07:31,690
some a drones

133
00:07:31,690 --> 00:07:35,210
now this is this is really something
some on looking at outside your home

134
00:07:35,210 --> 00:07:35,889
what's the

135
00:07:35,889 --> 00:07:39,190
threats to privacy so I

136
00:07:39,190 --> 00:07:42,360
this a lot of activity coming out on the
web about drones

137
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:45,470
that there are a number facilities being
about

138
00:07:45,470 --> 00:07:49,360
conceptualized in the US proposed for
drone bases

139
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:52,620
and it could either be the sum big
drones

140
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:55,669
for these baby drones

141
00:07:55,669 --> 00:07:59,080
and some really small ones are coming
out there like fireflies

142
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:03,068
they're hard to see arm and then the US
Army has blimps a course

143
00:08:03,069 --> 00:08:07,750
so anything a real and %uh some hackers
have developed their own versions

144
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:10,750
been presented black hat and DEFCON last
year

145
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:14,629
arm but a there's a possibility so a lot
of governments

146
00:08:14,629 --> 00:08:18,840
and local a large force min can nom

147
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:23,400
can apply to use drones and they've
declared to the FAA

148
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:28,759
but drones arm becoming more pervasive

149
00:08:28,759 --> 00:08:31,789
your car so I believe the so a bill

150
00:08:31,789 --> 00:08:34,979
in congress I don't know if it's passed
to our require

151
00:08:34,979 --> 00:08:38,399
a black boxes like an airplane to be in
your car

152
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:41,909
a lot a car still have them have now
this the Nash

153
00:08:41,909 --> 00:08:44,980
so that that records data on where you
travel

154
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:48,570
of faster going things like that which
is very useful in an accident

155
00:08:48,570 --> 00:08:49,860
investigation

156
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:53,910
com so beautiful tune of that car
driving has a black box

157
00:08:53,910 --> 00:08:56,949
the national vehicle locator service
keeps a database

158
00:08:56,950 --> 00:09:00,019
up pictures I love love license plates

159
00:09:00,019 --> 00:09:03,880
on so that when the government to the
DEA or the or the FBI's looking for

160
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:04,540
someone like

161
00:09:04,540 --> 00:09:08,360
that's 11 the sources they can tap into
to

162
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:12,269
to try to locate someone are GPS
locators

163
00:09:12,269 --> 00:09:16,709
I think it was a up a the circuit court
decision

164
00:09:16,709 --> 00:09:20,190
which may or may not be nationwide but
that was a decision saying you can't be

165
00:09:20,190 --> 00:09:21,959
place without a permit

166
00:09:21,959 --> 00:09:27,510
don't worry they'll find try to find a
way around that

167
00:09:27,510 --> 00:09:30,529
and personal ads and geolocation like in
minority report

168
00:09:30,529 --> 00:09:34,230
I was gonna do with the move what movie
or Ian but its it's hard to say they

169
00:09:34,230 --> 00:09:35,700
also overlap

170
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:38,980
but in my report he's walking through
with the fake ice from

171
00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:42,269
from that from the the FAA's eyes
replaced

172
00:09:42,269 --> 00:09:45,940
and they're responding to the retinal
scan and they're giving a personalized

173
00:09:45,940 --> 00:09:47,490
ads based upon who

174
00:09:47,490 --> 00:09:50,740
with the eyes usually you used to belong
to arm

175
00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:54,339
and those are under development are
immersive laps

176
00:09:54,339 --> 00:09:57,709
beds cameras and displays and there are

177
00:09:57,709 --> 00:10:01,170
some a retail locations now that our

178
00:10:01,170 --> 00:10:04,630
up have networks where they the they
find your cell phone

179
00:10:04,630 --> 00:10:07,779
to get your Mac address: and they can we
get to who you are

180
00:10:07,779 --> 00:10:12,060
om and then give you personalized ads
based upon a database of where you been

181
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:15,110
and in your shopping and French
billboards

182
00:10:15,110 --> 00:10:18,870
I'm told call your cell phone time I try
to get dumped a lot of the things that

183
00:10:18,870 --> 00:10:19,579
the point is

184
00:10:19,579 --> 00:10:22,640
some there's a lot of things chipping
away on

185
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:27,819
it's for the government its marketers
try sell you something

186
00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:33,350
I its its all the above

187
00:10:33,350 --> 00:10:37,120
secret code in color printers age had to
mention this I I learned about this by

188
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:37,910
it

189
00:10:37,910 --> 00:10:41,410
watching me cook Nicole hi Colin kanan

190
00:10:41,410 --> 00:10:44,610
in the TED Talks up he said in you know

191
00:10:44,610 --> 00:10:47,779
for example in nineteen eighties during
the Cold War

192
00:10:47,779 --> 00:10:51,060
ish in Germany every whatever type array
had to register it so that the

193
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:52,310
government could find out

194
00:10:52,310 --> 00:10:55,630
you know and then give us ample so he
wrote something critical the government

195
00:10:55,630 --> 00:10:57,500
or something that in like they could to

196
00:10:57,500 --> 00:11:01,970
find out who typed it well deff and I
think marcia happens here

197
00:11:01,970 --> 00:11:04,970
she's here now but effect this year as

198
00:11:04,970 --> 00:11:08,519
done a study where they try to document
the secret codes that are now in laser

199
00:11:08,519 --> 00:11:09,480
printers

200
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:12,760
for many laser printers on so that the
government

201
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:15,779
can do the same thing now now maybe not
to

202
00:11:15,779 --> 00:11:19,730
suppressed free speech of course why
would they do that

203
00:11:19,730 --> 00:11:23,540
on but the if they want to identify Word
document came from

204
00:11:23,540 --> 00:11:27,040
it's possible with the secret codes that
are in like light colored yellow or

205
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:28,130
green or

206
00:11:28,130 --> 00:11:32,410
something you can obviously see arm to
check the EF F website

207
00:11:32,410 --> 00:11:37,810
forum documentation on on and some other
codes have been able to decode

208
00:11:37,810 --> 00:11:41,320
arm so me going to stalk

209
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:45,880
he was surprised said people should know
about this he surprised how many people

210
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:46,670
don't know this

211
00:11:46,670 --> 00:11:49,829
and I didn't know it so I figured I'd
throw it in because that's a serious

212
00:11:49,829 --> 00:11:51,029
invasion of privacy

213
00:11:51,029 --> 00:11:54,480
type something up be printed out you
make copies and

214
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:58,010
somebody you the cover someone else who
knows the code can figure out

215
00:11:58,010 --> 00:12:02,319
which machine it was and maybe track
back to you so

216
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:05,540
it's it's this really know when to this
sort of chipping away at

217
00:12:05,540 --> 00:12:09,550
doing something privately warrantless
eavesdropping

218
00:12:09,550 --> 00:12:13,589
again I will read everything but its

219
00:12:13,589 --> 00:12:17,490
you know started with portion Obama's
been keeping keeping it going

220
00:12:17,490 --> 00:12:22,760
on but don't worry selection on a
terrace you nothing to worry about

221
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:26,470
so a it's only international they sure
so international naval

222
00:12:26,470 --> 00:12:29,899
listen to anyone who's point not talking
about something with a foreign

223
00:12:29,899 --> 00:12:34,329
foreign address but we shall should be
worried because again it's

224
00:12:34,329 --> 00:12:38,959
its thousands or millions have phone
calls and data

225
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:43,240
%uh that's being collected

226
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:46,740
a people cell phones so again others

227
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:49,910
its ourselves so there's people
everywhere taking a picture

228
00:12:49,910 --> 00:12:53,269
or video a Google Glasses

229
00:12:53,269 --> 00:12:56,430
if they takeoff on that a picture right
there

230
00:12:56,430 --> 00:12:59,620
I'll was a threat there well it's again
it's developing data

231
00:12:59,620 --> 00:13:03,209
so you walk around cool glasses and its
ability database

232
00:13:03,209 --> 00:13:06,430
Google which course remembers everything

233
00:13:06,430 --> 00:13:09,600
they have service going back to
beginning have Google the record

234
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:10,370
everything that

235
00:13:10,370 --> 00:13:14,290
you know and every search ever done any
anything that anyone's ever done

236
00:13:14,290 --> 00:13:18,209
on their pages saw an add to that total
database to courses for useful to

237
00:13:18,209 --> 00:13:19,209
marketers

238
00:13:19,209 --> 00:13:22,579
and maybe maybe other parties arm

239
00:13:22,579 --> 00:13:26,260
and a I ran into an interesting web page
it's a joke

240
00:13:26,260 --> 00:13:29,500
or maybe side a joke saying hey the
government really succeeded in getting

241
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:32,220
people to voluntarily disclose what
they're doing

242
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:35,329
which is what lot of people do want
Facebook Twitter

243
00:13:35,329 --> 00:13:38,510
a LinkedIn

244
00:13:38,510 --> 00:13:42,639
MySpace and off thats all around arm but
a lot of people

245
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:47,139
a the I think mostly teenagers and high
school students

246
00:13:47,139 --> 00:13:50,139
up just tell people everything you're
doing and then they're shocked

247
00:13:50,139 --> 00:13:54,320
shocked that people ur you know talking
about what they do

248
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:59,730
and Jeff auction aka to reporters here
they did a story on early this year

249
00:13:59,730 --> 00:14:03,829
on it is also a threat though even if
you're not on Facebook

250
00:14:03,829 --> 00:14:07,449
people can talk about what you doing on
Facebook any information about you can

251
00:14:07,449 --> 00:14:08,750
still leak out

252
00:14:08,750 --> 00:14:12,760
so long and a course Facebook is
monetize at into the billions

253
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:16,760
and been so it's a useful tool with but
this millions a

254
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:21,699
appoint a data being collected for
marketers and God knows who else

255
00:14:21,699 --> 00:14:25,860
soldiers arm so it's ourselves Pogo you
know

256
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:30,040
we've seen the enemy its ourselves and a
course I just saw this

257
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:33,610
a couple days ago I am so airports

258
00:14:33,610 --> 00:14:37,079
I invasion of privacy is we enter on you
note

259
00:14:37,079 --> 00:14:40,769
get on a flight there are a new laser
scanners

260
00:14:40,769 --> 00:14:44,959
per which 50 meters awaken see
everything

261
00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:48,660
10 million times faster 1,000,000 times
more sensitive than the current

262
00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:50,469
available system

263
00:14:50,470 --> 00:14:53,329
and you have to be in line again it
course they're talking about it for

264
00:14:53,329 --> 00:14:54,180
airports but

265
00:14:54,180 --> 00:14:57,529
why not anywhere else you know arm

266
00:14:57,529 --> 00:15:02,410
so that's the headline from Gizmodo so
the stories and Gizmodo

267
00:15:02,410 --> 00:15:05,660
on or give credit to the judge in a a

268
00:15:05,660 --> 00:15:08,939
Jenny a that a photonics kiko

269
00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:12,399
second programmable laser scanner

270
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:15,690
can look at you and fight so

271
00:15:15,690 --> 00:15:20,589
sorry right at the bottom there to Jan
jin et a today a

272
00:15:20,589 --> 00:15:24,790
so on this is not into this is not
intend to be a thorough discussion

273
00:15:24,790 --> 00:15:28,990
love erosion a privacy outside the home
but its it cover to cover some

274
00:15:28,990 --> 00:15:33,389
some major issues that I've seen so far

275
00:15:33,389 --> 00:15:37,220
so the big question is do the walls have
a home protect privacy anymore

276
00:15:37,220 --> 00:15:40,480
so Chris Desmond a master's thesis
candidate

277
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:44,630
on looking at on some use a law school

278
00:15:44,630 --> 00:15:48,339
in Canada I believe are looked at this
question

279
00:15:48,339 --> 00:15:51,329
and had in this great quote the walls
and maintain the privacy the man's

280
00:15:51,329 --> 00:15:55,649
appears a thousand years have been made
obsolete by stacking logical advances

281
00:15:55,649 --> 00:15:59,449
so wasn't that long ago that you know
you're inside your home

282
00:15:59,449 --> 00:16:03,050
and you're safe from private from being
so gone

283
00:16:03,050 --> 00:16:06,980
arm across such a real class home i'd of
family lives in it

284
00:16:06,980 --> 00:16:11,990
but its the conceptual design by an
Italian a design team

285
00:16:11,990 --> 00:16:15,019
to somebody well-known technologies as
tempers attack

286
00:16:15,019 --> 00:16:18,230
%uh outside the home can read electronic
a signature

287
00:16:18,230 --> 00:16:21,730
a electronic emissions from me monitor

288
00:16:21,730 --> 00:16:26,920
literacy are key are I presume also from
an LCD but I'm not sure

289
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:31,480
arm and and there's a way to read what
you're typing on the on the monitor

290
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:34,769
keep your viewing can be read revealed a
smart electric meter there's a paper

291
00:16:34,769 --> 00:16:35,839
that came out in Germany

292
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:39,009
last year I'll like in Chorley com

293
00:16:39,009 --> 00:16:43,019
sort of are the timing up when they know
that the keys on

294
00:16:43,019 --> 00:16:47,649
and they can detect the channel arm you
just match it up with the schedule and

295
00:16:47,649 --> 00:16:49,540
you can find what someone's watching

296
00:16:49,540 --> 00:16:53,320
are electric meter signal sousa a talk
at Def Con last year

297
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:57,490
on I think David Kennedy on how a few
the electric meter

298
00:16:57,490 --> 00:17:00,810
just to get a reading the fluctuations
in in New

299
00:17:00,810 --> 00:17:04,600
electric use you can determine are
what's going on inside the house

300
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:07,760
from electric arm I activity not

301
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:11,059
comes close to 1 I'll be talking about
in the poker the talk

302
00:17:11,059 --> 00:17:14,250
course tapping in in eavesdropping on on

303
00:17:14,250 --> 00:17:18,539
computers is no no mystery on and your
Internet activity

304
00:17:18,539 --> 00:17:21,849
are but we're were going going to it
another level

305
00:17:21,849 --> 00:17:25,079
are in the stalk on that so

306
00:17:25,079 --> 00:17:29,370
course a smart grid so I gave a talk
last year action early this year twice

307
00:17:29,370 --> 00:17:33,640
and Lasher like at DEFCON on are smart
water meters

308
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:37,090
Wireless water meters and on

309
00:17:37,090 --> 00:17:40,178
when I did the research I didn't realize
at the beginning that the major concern

310
00:17:40,179 --> 00:17:42,169
to be privacy

311
00:17:42,169 --> 00:17:45,940
so are right now your water department
presumably is

312
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:49,510
has a mechanical meter hit most place
the US

313
00:17:49,510 --> 00:17:52,570
that is red quarterly because they have
to pay someone to go out

314
00:17:52,570 --> 00:17:56,129
knock on the door called on the basement
read the meter on

315
00:17:56,130 --> 00:17:59,210
you said that about seven percent of US
homes have

316
00:17:59,210 --> 00:18:02,559
up have smart meters to go beyond that
that are

317
00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:05,990
well wireless meters anyway that sent a
signal up

318
00:18:05,990 --> 00:18:10,380
on in the venture sending a signal out
or having received for summer driving by

319
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:11,130
the home

320
00:18:11,130 --> 00:18:14,980
or received a central facility for
billing is that

321
00:18:14,980 --> 00:18:18,580
you can change the frequency such you
don't have to pay for people to go out

322
00:18:18,580 --> 00:18:22,668
and arm read the meters you can you
can't you can check on the frequency of

323
00:18:22,669 --> 00:18:23,340
water use

324
00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:26,510
every our everyday every five minutes

325
00:18:26,510 --> 00:18:29,629
which is very useful to the water
department to determine leaks determined

326
00:18:29,630 --> 00:18:32,090
people using water on that supposed to

327
00:18:32,090 --> 00:18:36,760
are but it also gives you a very
fine-grained art detailed information

328
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:40,370
water use to you can use to determine
what's going on home

329
00:18:40,370 --> 00:18:43,490
so this is I am just one piece for my
talk

330
00:18:43,490 --> 00:18:46,780
on Wiles water meters where are from a a

331
00:18:46,780 --> 00:18:51,570
online newspaper called the Carrie
watchman are from Cary North Carolina

332
00:18:51,570 --> 00:18:54,629
that the right to be concerned about the
information our private lives

333
00:18:54,630 --> 00:18:58,809
the town self able to collect from the
acostar AM I water meter system

334
00:18:58,809 --> 00:19:04,090
is is is implemented om and they give a
call from a technology futurist keynote

335
00:19:04,090 --> 00:19:05,360
speaker at ok

336
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:09,059
conference on they can tell when to take
a shower when taken

337
00:19:09,059 --> 00:19:12,789
messages from the water meter I'll get
into techniques that are even

338
00:19:12,789 --> 00:19:15,929
more useful than that too funny what you
doing

339
00:19:15,929 --> 00:19:20,590
are I gave up my wireless wattmeter talk
in madison wisconsin yesterday

340
00:19:20,590 --> 00:19:23,689
and after I gave the talk I talk to some
people from the University

341
00:19:23,690 --> 00:19:26,700
wisconsin where I give the talk in the
city we found out that

342
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:29,980
that the city Madison Wisconsin just
bought aka

343
00:19:29,980 --> 00:19:33,450
pit wall to sign a contract to install
you know tens of thousands while

344
00:19:33,450 --> 00:19:35,100
swatting Israel the city

345
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:38,720
and like most in the got a cryptid the
you something called frequency hopping

346
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:39,780
spread spectrum

347
00:19:39,780 --> 00:19:43,889
which you know is thought it was
encrypted in which came into war to

348
00:19:43,890 --> 00:19:47,380
it's a but its obscurity so every packet
is sent out

349
00:19:47,380 --> 00:19:50,830
%uh with the different frequency that
presumably only the sender and the

350
00:19:50,830 --> 00:19:51,820
receiver now

351
00:19:51,820 --> 00:19:55,530
the trouble is it's not really
encryption and there are

352
00:19:55,530 --> 00:19:58,940
fairly easy ways to to break that arm

353
00:19:58,940 --> 00:20:03,460
but in any event up whether or not the
water department is going to be sinister

354
00:20:03,460 --> 00:20:05,549
and use the information

355
00:20:05,549 --> 00:20:09,510
on somehow based upon what your home

356
00:20:09,510 --> 00:20:12,780
I don't think as a former water
Commissioner I'd I really doubt the law

357
00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:15,460
going to do that missus a personal thing
going on in some

358
00:20:15,460 --> 00:20:19,210
some in the water department wants to
get someone who based upon the data

359
00:20:19,210 --> 00:20:22,260
the trouble is the date is created in
Atlas forever

360
00:20:22,260 --> 00:20:26,320
and was gonna go so privacy is the
biggest

361
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:30,850
a question you see out there mostly for
the smart grid for electricity

362
00:20:30,850 --> 00:20:34,620
for gas in for water

363
00:20:34,620 --> 00:20:38,370
okay here we go infrastructure mediated
single point sensing like

364
00:20:38,370 --> 00:20:42,770
having a long technical term arm
infrastructure sensing is my shorthand

365
00:20:42,770 --> 00:20:43,549
for

366
00:20:43,549 --> 00:20:47,030
on so its use a existing-home
infrastructure

367
00:20:47,030 --> 00:20:50,418
so this is a way without having to chip
you which upon you

368
00:20:50,419 --> 00:20:53,799
or or a or a transmitter or already

369
00:20:53,799 --> 00:20:58,280
a microphone or have cameras in the home
find what you doing in the home

370
00:20:58,280 --> 00:21:01,370
now getting to you white anybody would
want to do that in a

371
00:21:01,370 --> 00:21:06,080
good sense arm the contactor the term in
human activity

372
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:09,289
I'll so eliminate the need for sensors
or or

373
00:21:09,289 --> 00:21:13,140
chips I'll work with other such a device
and methods

374
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:16,299
this is not the same thing is a smart
home which

375
00:21:16,299 --> 00:21:20,250
we've been reading about in science
fiction for many years but

376
00:21:20,250 --> 00:21:25,360
still hasn't come to fruition on Iran
arc on the smart home a while ago when

377
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:28,600
the main reason maybe people why people
why would you need it

378
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:32,159
though there are applications out there
that arse are similar to the smart home

379
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:35,590
where you have a home area network we
can help settle control over

380
00:21:35,590 --> 00:21:39,289
appliances which is good for rum you
know

381
00:21:39,289 --> 00:21:43,580
controlling I'll electricity use if you
want lower your electric bill

382
00:21:43,580 --> 00:21:49,449
arm sold most this these devices in this
research comes primarily at the

383
00:21:49,450 --> 00:21:51,890
ubiquitous computing research lab
Ubicomp

384
00:21:51,890 --> 00:21:56,450
at the University of Washington are its
copper basic computing

385
00:21:56,450 --> 00:22:00,120
are ubiquitous computing bigness means
everywhere

386
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:03,980
arm these are not in production yet but
there's a lotta research in a number

387
00:22:03,980 --> 00:22:05,059
papers on the web

388
00:22:05,059 --> 00:22:10,510
about this so sustainability to reduce
yousef natural resources like water

389
00:22:10,510 --> 00:22:14,770
get natural gas on fossil fuels for the
most part

390
00:22:14,770 --> 00:22:18,340
that power electricity anna's use for

391
00:22:18,340 --> 00:22:23,149
arm health something

392
00:22:23,150 --> 00:22:26,390
and so these are some other purposes at
the propose

393
00:22:26,390 --> 00:22:31,610
for are so hiker sets this is how I got
into it and looking at

394
00:22:31,610 --> 00:22:35,049
I'll Wireless water meters read about
hyder cents

395
00:22:35,049 --> 00:22:39,120
in this is very tech technically this is
very absurdist cated

396
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:45,080
but very simple so arm so you wanna find
out

397
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:48,710
are what so with this device on the back
up with this device

398
00:22:48,710 --> 00:22:52,140
you that's very simple small device it
doesn't cost much

399
00:22:52,140 --> 00:22:55,620
your cash into any pizza plumbing in the
house

400
00:22:55,620 --> 00:22:58,750
and after being calibrated as a little
whiles

401
00:22:58,750 --> 00:23:02,580
transceiver on it I have to be
calibrated you can tell

402
00:23:02,580 --> 00:23:07,000
which fixture was turned on or off in a
particular time

403
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:10,100
and how much water is used and you can
develop a very

404
00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:13,250
precise database up water use

405
00:23:13,250 --> 00:23:16,390
so toilet faucet shower

406
00:23:16,390 --> 00:23:19,650
tub kitchen on

407
00:23:19,650 --> 00:23:24,220
I mean everywhere on and in it uses
something called

408
00:23:24,220 --> 00:23:28,380
police cells law were a which I won't
read

409
00:23:28,380 --> 00:23:32,570
arm but these craft give you the idea
apart works is that the

410
00:23:32,570 --> 00:23:36,600
the open event when you when you I know
from experience in

411
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:40,380
in water you know when you open to close
a valve you create a water hammer

412
00:23:40,380 --> 00:23:43,630
which creates a sound or in a vibration

413
00:23:43,630 --> 00:23:47,929
and so this read it and I can tell the
difference between an open to close

414
00:23:47,929 --> 00:23:51,940
arm so strong device

415
00:23:51,940 --> 00:23:57,070
a miss a change in pressure on its up to
wireless

416
00:23:57,070 --> 00:24:00,580
and there are on so there's less its
battery-powered

417
00:24:00,580 --> 00:24:03,418
but there's a but the really been
working on it as one that actually

418
00:24:03,419 --> 00:24:04,900
powers itself from the water

419
00:24:04,900 --> 00:24:08,289
going the vibrational water going to the
pipe %uh

420
00:24:08,289 --> 00:24:11,970
so there there there's there's a lot of
development work going on this these are

421
00:24:11,970 --> 00:24:13,070
not a production yet

422
00:24:13,070 --> 00:24:16,189
not the ones that I'm talking about an
hour in production yet but

423
00:24:16,190 --> 00:24:20,230
they may I'll talk about why gas sense

424
00:24:20,230 --> 00:24:25,000
so this is attached to where the gas
enters the house

425
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:28,010
are are and it uses sound

426
00:24:28,010 --> 00:24:31,270
toward it so it listens to the sound of
the gas

427
00:24:31,270 --> 00:24:35,889
natural gas ensuring the house she's a
hot water heating Stouffer's fireplace

428
00:24:35,890 --> 00:24:37,580
clothes dryers

429
00:24:37,580 --> 00:24:41,090
so those things don't muscles don't use
water solar covers

430
00:24:41,090 --> 00:24:44,320
are are some different bases

431
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:47,480
arm so they're a couple studies that I
quoted from here

432
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:51,600
are so calibrated by turning gas
appliances on our offer recording sounds

433
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:54,669
so saw that these are can be put in
surreptitiously

434
00:24:54,669 --> 00:24:57,980
on and suddenly figure these things out
although

435
00:24:57,980 --> 00:25:01,500
I'm sure some could figure that out but
at this point you have to put it on

436
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:05,919
so this it's a lot still being studied
you put it on you do the calibration

437
00:25:05,919 --> 00:25:08,850
any good the same thing that you with
Tiger sent you determine what's been

438
00:25:08,850 --> 00:25:09,760
turned on or off

439
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:13,210
and how much gas is used arm so

440
00:25:13,210 --> 00:25:17,039
so that so the the the the successes
that helps provide a complete picture

441
00:25:17,039 --> 00:25:21,129
whole-home human activity know what you
doing in the house along with water use

442
00:25:21,130 --> 00:25:24,570
new Eagle feedback to buy still Peters
monitor perhaps reduce our natural gas

443
00:25:24,570 --> 00:25:25,149
usage

444
00:25:25,150 --> 00:25:28,789
so that's a beneficial use right to
reduce use natural gas

445
00:25:28,789 --> 00:25:32,820
you get the same benefit as natural gas
by using lesson you're paying less

446
00:25:32,820 --> 00:25:35,870
so that's good right elector cents

447
00:25:35,870 --> 00:25:39,809
so arm so the switch mode power supplies
will turn

448
00:25:39,809 --> 00:25:43,260
most appliances a.m. is a high-frequency
electromagnetic

449
00:25:43,260 --> 00:25:46,299
I on pulse and

450
00:25:46,299 --> 00:25:49,779
I it as a signature specific to a device

451
00:25:49,779 --> 00:25:53,429
and a defect but electricity is easy in
that sense com P

452
00:25:53,429 --> 00:25:58,120
Kors so i cant so that's everything else
in the house as electrical

453
00:25:58,120 --> 00:26:01,679
location sensing and this is just a part
picture

454
00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:05,070
so they could there are devices you can
put it if you've got a a

455
00:26:05,070 --> 00:26:09,389
up air conditioning system a check
system

456
00:26:09,390 --> 00:26:12,909
in the house or building on most houses
may not have that

457
00:26:12,909 --> 00:26:16,130
in New England anywhere I live in the
eastern US but maybe

458
00:26:16,130 --> 00:26:19,950
other parts the country doing a course
apartments condos

459
00:26:19,950 --> 00:26:23,900
are government facilities private
facilities have them as well

460
00:26:23,900 --> 00:26:26,960
arm so a single sensor

461
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:31,990
just can detect the disruption in air
flow last 35 eighty percent accurate can

462
00:26:31,990 --> 00:26:32,840
determine

463
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:36,070
wheres that you know one or two people
where they're going what what their

464
00:26:36,070 --> 00:26:38,010
activities are in the house

465
00:26:38,010 --> 00:26:41,610
are smart for such an easy way to do it
so the pressure sensors

466
00:26:41,610 --> 00:26:44,760
in a grid in the house and you can

467
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:49,049
calibrated so you know who's walking and
who in where they're walking

468
00:26:49,049 --> 00:26:54,080
and and and in get a database of the
exactly what's going on there

469
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:58,129
powerline positioning this this means
you have to have something on you

470
00:26:58,130 --> 00:27:01,809
like a a chip or met re: microphone or
something

471
00:27:01,809 --> 00:27:05,129
arm so the so so you got water

472
00:27:05,130 --> 00:27:09,549
gas-electric om location

473
00:27:09,549 --> 00:27:13,650
so they can find out what you doing in
the house

474
00:27:13,650 --> 00:27:17,140
and again these are that the I'm not
saying this is done surreptitiously

475
00:27:17,140 --> 00:27:21,000
someone's installing select knowing it
would be very hard in most cities

476
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:24,260
but that's not what the ideas arm

477
00:27:24,260 --> 00:27:28,809
so the the the acronym is ATL activities
of daily life

478
00:27:28,809 --> 00:27:32,970
so who went where who did what up here
automation

479
00:27:32,970 --> 00:27:37,360
so this is a um try to find some more
examples for this but this is the best

480
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:39,279
one so it so you get a pattern

481
00:27:39,279 --> 00:27:45,100
from these different answers and this
pattern set out there having breakfast

482
00:27:45,100 --> 00:27:49,130
on so looks at what this i think is
primarily water but you get water and

483
00:27:49,130 --> 00:27:49,880
gas

484
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:54,340
and a location there in the kitchen the
kitchen faucet on

485
00:27:54,340 --> 00:27:59,299
are still arm you know there's enough
water to put key in the cattle or

486
00:27:59,299 --> 00:28:03,750
or make make make a copy so to having
breakfast

487
00:28:03,750 --> 00:28:07,120
others a different pattern for for
dinner might be some lower

488
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:10,600
different pattern for going to bed
different at different pattern for

489
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:14,980
other things you're doing so you even a
replication sensors they can find out

490
00:28:14,980 --> 00:28:19,100
from the water and gas electricity what
rooms people are doing things in

491
00:28:19,100 --> 00:28:22,539
in the more sense as you add are the
more information you get

492
00:28:22,539 --> 00:28:26,330
are behavior automation health status

493
00:28:26,330 --> 00:28:31,230
that's one the beneficial uses in a.m.

494
00:28:31,230 --> 00:28:35,840
and correlate with other information are
so they're a lot of studies on this

495
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:39,820
arm the massive studies I'll were
actually that the researchers trying to

496
00:28:39,820 --> 00:28:40,668
find out now

497
00:28:40,669 --> 00:28:43,960
so if we put all the sensors in on

498
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:47,380
there in a couple problems like running
out electrical outlets for someone like

499
00:28:47,380 --> 00:28:47,770
me

500
00:28:47,770 --> 00:28:51,490
need power on their own you run into
electrical interference from one set

501
00:28:51,490 --> 00:28:54,909
you several frequencies so the working
that out up don't worry

502
00:28:54,909 --> 00:28:59,110
to working that out and and and so it's
ok to be easier and simpler

503
00:28:59,110 --> 00:29:03,120
to build the house or condo or
government facility

504
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:07,730
were they can track everything you doing

505
00:29:07,730 --> 00:29:11,720
I mean why not okay so health monitoring
in the home

506
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:15,490
I'll elderly in assisted living
facilities

507
00:29:15,490 --> 00:29:20,370
those are two so the similar things so
looking at water use

508
00:29:20,370 --> 00:29:23,440
mom mobility %uh

509
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:26,549
it you can get help indications on

510
00:29:26,549 --> 00:29:29,740
and there's a lot of fine-grained
analysis but done

511
00:29:29,740 --> 00:29:33,330
for many years said elderly home elderly

512
00:29:33,330 --> 00:29:36,740
in assisted living facilities where you
know

513
00:29:36,740 --> 00:29:41,510
a there's an 80 in the home or visit the
home or their camera switch

514
00:29:41,510 --> 00:29:45,549
is intrusive so we so the way doing
without cameras

515
00:29:45,549 --> 00:29:50,220
so you can see a reduction in mobility
%uh the toilet it uses much

516
00:29:50,220 --> 00:29:53,320
other not drawing water the night doing
something

517
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:57,350
that that's a health issue arm that's
the easy one to figure out there are

518
00:29:57,350 --> 00:29:58,250
many others

519
00:29:58,250 --> 00:30:01,309
that a years love assisted living

520
00:30:01,309 --> 00:30:04,740
research I can correlate with some of
these things to look at

521
00:30:04,740 --> 00:30:09,200
help so that's a good thing so you have
assisted living facility

522
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:13,640
in a city paying for it an aide to be in
each with the person all the time or

523
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:14,390
visit us

524
00:30:14,390 --> 00:30:17,730
you probably wanna visit once a while
you can set these things up

525
00:30:17,730 --> 00:30:22,140
and set up on the computer and you know
have a flag go off if certain things

526
00:30:22,140 --> 00:30:23,500
happen

527
00:30:23,500 --> 00:30:27,539
so that's that a a positive intent ovett

528
00:30:27,539 --> 00:30:30,539
arm resource in water conservation

529
00:30:30,539 --> 00:30:33,980
are soul which can help people who want
to conserve

530
00:30:33,980 --> 00:30:37,029
resources water gas electricity

531
00:30:37,029 --> 00:30:40,770
cuz they can get fine-grained
information on their use

532
00:30:40,770 --> 00:30:44,830
so if they want to reduce our electric
bill they can get report daily

533
00:30:44,830 --> 00:30:47,860
weekly monthly annually whatever

534
00:30:47,860 --> 00:30:51,330
to say okay you this is your bill this
is what you used

535
00:30:51,330 --> 00:30:54,389
during this time and so you voluntarily

536
00:30:54,390 --> 00:30:58,440
the positive so far you can voluntarily
say oh yeah I don't really need to use

537
00:30:58,440 --> 00:30:59,210
that as much I'll

538
00:30:59,210 --> 00:31:02,919
or reduce that and all the bill save
money same thing with water

539
00:31:02,919 --> 00:31:06,630
don't leave the for you know don't leave
the faucet running on

540
00:31:06,630 --> 00:31:10,269
take a shot take a bath and separate
shower usership you know

541
00:31:10,269 --> 00:31:14,029
there there's is also still rules you
can follow this is a way of helping you

542
00:31:14,029 --> 00:31:17,419
of all those rules to on achieve micro

543
00:31:17,419 --> 00:31:21,029
sustainability meaning free a little
home arm

544
00:31:21,029 --> 00:31:25,019
to be sustainable in terms of are
conserving natural resources

545
00:31:25,019 --> 00:31:29,710
and improve their lives so what's wrong
with improve your life right

546
00:31:29,710 --> 00:31:32,669
home health monitoring so there's a lot
of stuff on this that's not what I'm

547
00:31:32,669 --> 00:31:35,940
talking about specifically but there's
wearable matter medical sensors

548
00:31:35,940 --> 00:31:39,399
embedded medical sensors that the whole
all the talk

549
00:31:39,399 --> 00:31:42,769
arm they can't be hacked right course
they can

550
00:31:42,769 --> 00:31:46,820
on the slaughter research in that as
well on packing pacemakers

551
00:31:46,820 --> 00:31:50,289
and the implantable defibrillators

552
00:31:50,289 --> 00:31:53,309
because they're Wireless and they're not
a cryptid

553
00:31:53,309 --> 00:31:56,610
in most cases arm but again up

554
00:31:56,610 --> 00:31:59,960
so there's a lot of arm by to find
monitoring

555
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:03,200
motion analysis I mentioned earlier
parkinson's disease is one application

556
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:04,480
where you can look at

557
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:08,049
mobility our actions and correlated with
some

558
00:32:08,049 --> 00:32:12,220
you know health are early detection

559
00:32:12,220 --> 00:32:15,769
arm in his first responder prove like
quality

560
00:32:15,769 --> 00:32:18,919
so the lot there's a lot of good
research on this community where home

561
00:32:18,919 --> 00:32:19,659
resurgence

562
00:32:19,659 --> 00:32:23,190
initiative in Georgia kak they have like
a a model home setup

563
00:32:23,190 --> 00:32:26,840
where they experiment with these things
and again the intent is positive in

564
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:27,390
terms of

565
00:32:27,390 --> 00:32:30,640
how do we make home health monitoring so
someone is in

566
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:34,919
put into a home but there in their home
but I T set these things up so that

567
00:32:34,919 --> 00:32:38,970
someone hill to the contract from
outside can keep track at the sayings

568
00:32:38,970 --> 00:32:40,809
and get a top or something

569
00:32:40,809 --> 00:32:44,039
say it's of the fall on the floor or
there's a the there's a

570
00:32:44,039 --> 00:32:48,600
episode this information can get
electronically sent to the

571
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:51,890
to the caregiver all the monitor and

572
00:32:51,890 --> 00:32:56,990
and respond arm so there's a whole
buncha technology in addition to what

573
00:32:56,990 --> 00:32:57,799
I'm talking about

574
00:32:57,799 --> 00:33:02,629
that that works on this in this field as
well

575
00:33:02,630 --> 00:33:07,390
so assisted livings I've mentioned a few
times a

576
00:33:07,390 --> 00:33:11,149
alarm at University Virginia smart
medical home

577
00:33:11,149 --> 00:33:14,289
aware home Georgia Tech again so they're
looking at

578
00:33:14,289 --> 00:33:17,559
arm so this is mortars stuff but again
on

579
00:33:17,559 --> 00:33:22,230
sort along the same idea I'll see you
get something on on the person

580
00:33:22,230 --> 00:33:25,850
so I can check their heart P the blood
pressure

581
00:33:25,850 --> 00:33:29,289
on but in addition to the other a a

582
00:33:29,289 --> 00:33:33,990
infrastructure mediated technologies I
gives you a richer picture

583
00:33:33,990 --> 00:33:39,380
up what the activity is to help are
protect the health of the person

584
00:33:39,380 --> 00:33:44,000
us a resource conservation I'll soul
reduce unnecessary use of scarce

585
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,730
resources

586
00:33:45,730 --> 00:33:50,440
on reducing violent missions reduced
cover for put all the good stuff

587
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:54,409
the term is Microcenter bility on

588
00:33:54,409 --> 00:33:57,409
so we get detail information on your
water use

589
00:33:57,409 --> 00:34:00,909
you can review that yourself voluntarily

590
00:34:00,909 --> 00:34:03,960
ever issues are

591
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:07,539
so if your municipality your state has
water conservation

592
00:34:07,539 --> 00:34:10,790
requirements or recommendations it helps
you fall that

593
00:34:10,790 --> 00:34:15,800
say that for natural gas and electric
use

594
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:18,960
on and so does their papers written
about this sis

595
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:23,190
sippy in goals arm life improvement
goals

596
00:34:23,190 --> 00:34:27,190
so improve health fitness so again if
you had these in your home

597
00:34:27,190 --> 00:34:30,530
you could so instead of writing that
down what your activities are which is a

598
00:34:30,530 --> 00:34:31,119
good wave

599
00:34:31,119 --> 00:34:34,800
above feedback for yourself arm you can

600
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:37,960
this'll give you you know how often to
drop their figure air hole how much is

601
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:39,079
use the water

602
00:34:39,079 --> 00:34:42,540
arm if you have the four sensors are the
effects such as you can

603
00:34:42,540 --> 00:34:46,129
you can check in your movements in the
house arm

604
00:34:46,129 --> 00:34:49,429
saw can capture all the info are make
use that information by Traci

605
00:34:49,429 --> 00:34:51,010
performance

606
00:34:51,010 --> 00:34:54,409
and a as a whole our school of thought

607
00:34:54,409 --> 00:34:58,890
research on am and up terrible affinity
Asian for some reason today

608
00:34:58,890 --> 00:35:02,790
mean the name center architecture

609
00:35:02,790 --> 00:35:07,349
on wary it did it further develops data
that's collected

610
00:35:07,349 --> 00:35:10,760
through these infrastructure mediated
sensing to

611
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:14,000
to the track

612
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:17,820
talking a rock nothing right I mean

613
00:35:17,820 --> 00:35:21,089
that's a favor hacker question so I
research the things I look at

614
00:35:21,089 --> 00:35:25,049
you know like most you well this is what
they intended to be four

615
00:35:25,050 --> 00:35:29,960
but you know wenis what if something
ever use just for what's intended

616
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:34,410
I'll see if data leakage and arm

617
00:35:34,410 --> 00:35:38,868
but also are I think that the problem is
less that the government

618
00:35:38,869 --> 00:35:41,369
god forbid is gonna require some %uh
these things should say water

619
00:35:41,369 --> 00:35:42,250
conservation

620
00:35:42,250 --> 00:35:46,010
to be the biggest application but it
might be your landlord

621
00:35:46,010 --> 00:35:49,530
or your next landlord where are the
condo association

622
00:35:49,530 --> 00:35:53,109
are all the you know are who says so
they're under pressure

623
00:35:53,109 --> 00:35:58,319
wall get to that arm so the wireless
sensors such as could be hacked

624
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:03,640
collected Turkish isley I increase the
reach surveillance into the home

625
00:36:03,640 --> 00:36:07,160
arm the the evidence could be

626
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:11,420
falsified could abuse in a criminal case

627
00:36:11,420 --> 00:36:15,790
I'll could be inaccurate maybe softballs
if I did just wrong

628
00:36:15,790 --> 00:36:19,630
but some attacks apart so this is a
laundry list div

629
00:36:19,630 --> 00:36:22,650
some things that could go wrong so let's
look at them

630
00:36:22,650 --> 00:36:27,410
will the data leak out no course not arm
I started a catalog this her just the

631
00:36:27,410 --> 00:36:28,720
list is too long

632
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:32,320
and in and it had everyday read about
more

633
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:36,190
on laptops being left at to airports
with the health data

634
00:36:36,190 --> 00:36:40,800
or 50,000 social security numbers on
someone hacked a database in his

635
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:41,910
password the username

636
00:36:41,910 --> 00:36:45,359
that happens every day om credit card
numbers

637
00:36:45,359 --> 00:36:49,098
a health information and I read
somewhere that Steve's will pay ten

638
00:36:49,099 --> 00:36:52,280
times more personal health information
for credit cards

639
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:56,200
I don't know why maybe someone here
knows why but that's that's the

640
00:36:56,200 --> 00:37:00,089
information available find credit cards
actually at work that much because

641
00:37:00,089 --> 00:37:03,529
on there there the

642
00:37:03,530 --> 00:37:06,900
the theft has detected in there they're
closed they're they're close up pretty

643
00:37:06,900 --> 00:37:08,240
quickly apparently

644
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:11,890
arm but you get it you got social
security number well that's that's a

645
00:37:11,890 --> 00:37:12,750
fake identity

646
00:37:12,750 --> 00:37:16,150
as identity theft which is rampant arm

647
00:37:16,150 --> 00:37:20,730
now Pachuca %uh which is now quite a lot
bien

648
00:37:20,730 --> 00:37:24,050
ours an online database know it's a good
thing where people

649
00:37:24,050 --> 00:37:27,839
accumulate the data from monitoring
various things

650
00:37:27,839 --> 00:37:31,440
I am from from building monitoring
systems from

651
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:35,260
Wireless data so I'm not saying it's a
bad thing

652
00:37:35,260 --> 00:37:39,680
but again here's more and more data up
this type that's on the Internet

653
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:43,690
that builds a pattern builds a database
up thanks

654
00:37:43,690 --> 00:37:46,720
so it's an iPhone app which you know

655
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:51,119
could be hacked are so so there's more
more information

656
00:37:51,119 --> 00:37:54,660
I try to lookup are how much information
is there in the world

657
00:37:54,660 --> 00:37:57,990
ended keeps increasing a exponentially
or more

658
00:37:57,990 --> 00:38:01,570
arm and how much information and
personal behavior

659
00:38:01,570 --> 00:38:05,320
is there in the world and that's
increasing exponentially

660
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:09,040
so that's a whole nother talk right
there because that these technologies in

661
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:09,740
Pachuca

662
00:38:09,740 --> 00:38:13,220
and people monitoring themselves for the
for good purposes

663
00:38:13,220 --> 00:38:16,589
and these a health monitoring up

664
00:38:16,589 --> 00:38:19,990
data probably never goes away and as it
accumulates

665
00:38:19,990 --> 00:38:23,170
it it did it creates problems

666
00:38:23,170 --> 00:38:26,640
perhaps in the future for houses day
going to use like Tim

667
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:29,799
gigantic database that Google has on all
of us

668
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:32,810
%uh course the government could get it
very easily

669
00:38:32,810 --> 00:38:37,000
up from whoever the second third parties
that get the information

670
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:40,130
work they sell the information on

671
00:38:40,130 --> 00:38:43,130
so data data leaks out

672
00:38:43,130 --> 00:38:46,950
it's it's a rule elector camp I just
read about

673
00:38:46,950 --> 00:38:50,829
arm so up for the Internet of Things is
another topic

674
00:38:50,829 --> 00:38:53,290
is another word for what we're talking
about to the Internet of Things

675
00:38:53,290 --> 00:38:54,329
everything

676
00:38:54,329 --> 00:38:59,400
but with ipv6 taking off finally
everything's good have an IP address

677
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:02,930
and get the on internet almost
automatically so you can control or

678
00:39:02,930 --> 00:39:04,149
monitor it from anywhere

679
00:39:04,150 --> 00:39:07,240
with your iPhone years your Android or
or whatever

680
00:39:07,240 --> 00:39:10,530
%uh so this is another way of putting it
on the Internet

681
00:39:10,530 --> 00:39:13,900
arm any you can save resources so you
can

682
00:39:13,900 --> 00:39:17,890
with with elector camp or many other
applications like this in

683
00:39:17,890 --> 00:39:21,118
their ads now on on on on TV in in the
media

684
00:39:21,119 --> 00:39:25,500
for monitoring your home to your
smartphone which is a great idea

685
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:29,589
you know so but the data get screwed
gets created

686
00:39:29,589 --> 00:39:32,839
so it's not as much at the that that
summer's gonna hack into your smartphone

687
00:39:32,839 --> 00:39:33,200
in

688
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:36,930
and control your home or check your
video

689
00:39:36,930 --> 00:39:40,500
without you knowing it which course will
occur but on top of that all this data

690
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:41,810
is being collected

691
00:39:41,810 --> 00:39:45,589
and and and um and accumulated

692
00:39:45,589 --> 00:39:48,660
so this is from %uh this is a quote from
their web page

693
00:39:48,660 --> 00:39:51,660
arm it's just another way a farm

694
00:39:51,660 --> 00:39:56,009
you know a database being created from
these type devices

695
00:39:56,010 --> 00:39:59,950
and I'm I tried I'm not saying and being
fucked exhaustive in the type devices

696
00:39:59,950 --> 00:40:03,260
that use infrastructure mediated sensing
arm

697
00:40:03,260 --> 00:40:06,300
a lot of people use different terms for
similar things

698
00:40:06,300 --> 00:40:10,170
so the Internet of Things as you pick it
was ubiquitous computing

699
00:40:10,170 --> 00:40:13,310
pervasive computing I everything's

700
00:40:13,310 --> 00:40:16,950
becoming Wireless with an IP address
being on the Internet

701
00:40:16,950 --> 00:40:20,720
and many of them track what you do in
your home

702
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:26,869
what you do anywhere else and it's gonna
be hard to escape from that

703
00:40:26,869 --> 00:40:30,589
if it is already intercourse under CISPA

704
00:40:30,589 --> 00:40:34,578
I try to look at the recent this the big
love news about this earlier in the year

705
00:40:34,579 --> 00:40:37,190
and I try to find the latest in as far
as I know it's

706
00:40:37,190 --> 00:40:42,030
stills passed by the House Obama this
does people saying that Obama's will

707
00:40:42,030 --> 00:40:42,599
sign it

708
00:40:42,599 --> 00:40:46,829
if it passed the Senate but maybe FF
explain what's going on the senate I

709
00:40:46,829 --> 00:40:48,859
couldn't find the latest information

710
00:40:48,859 --> 00:40:52,170
but done the biggest problem for what
we're talking about

711
00:40:52,170 --> 00:40:56,839
notwithstanding any other provision of
law which has very broad term meaning

712
00:40:56,839 --> 00:41:00,060
this you can do it companies may share
information

713
00:41:00,060 --> 00:41:03,619
including federal government so like in
the while Wireless while a cat

714
00:41:03,619 --> 00:41:05,190
wiretapping the

715
00:41:05,190 --> 00:41:09,290
the telcos were just giving information
to the federal government

716
00:41:09,290 --> 00:41:13,170
well any any these entities that collect
this type information

717
00:41:13,170 --> 00:41:15,940
can just give it to the federal
government on request without you

718
00:41:15,940 --> 00:41:16,720
knowing about it

719
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:19,810
you need a search warrant you don't need
a subpoena arm

720
00:41:19,810 --> 00:41:22,880
you don't get a wiretap you don't need
up his mother

721
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:28,400
a secret court it's just out there

722
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:33,369
so that's another way that information
this information will be go

723
00:41:33,369 --> 00:41:36,569
so Google could be watching I'm sorry

724
00:41:36,569 --> 00:41:39,750
is watching I am

725
00:41:39,750 --> 00:41:43,569
so so it gets worse so Google is right
on top is a course

726
00:41:43,569 --> 00:41:46,900
there there there in the cutting-edge so
they're talking about

727
00:41:46,900 --> 00:41:50,020
actually getting a stated themselves
surprise surprise

728
00:41:50,020 --> 00:41:53,099
I mean the Google number has an update a

729
00:41:53,099 --> 00:41:56,359
so they wanna home activity recognition
I'm reading a some saying

730
00:41:56,359 --> 00:41:59,520
the sounds familiar that's what we're
talking about to track people's

731
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:01,910
activities are home network interactions

732
00:42:01,910 --> 00:42:05,180
so they talk about the home area network
re electric lectric you

733
00:42:05,180 --> 00:42:09,649
your electric appliances well I think
that's what the talking about

734
00:42:09,650 --> 00:42:12,849
among other things your home area
network which were electric appliances

735
00:42:12,849 --> 00:42:13,730
are networked

736
00:42:13,730 --> 00:42:16,770
and you get a central control center
that you can access to your smartphone

737
00:42:16,770 --> 00:42:17,920
most likely

738
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:21,190
where you can turn things on or off
remotely or in your home which is very

739
00:42:21,190 --> 00:42:22,400
useful

740
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:26,540
course its wireless it on the internet
so Google wants

741
00:42:26,540 --> 00:42:29,880
what to do with that information they're
gonna just do to protect your right

742
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:33,589
arm so to remind you to work take
medication

743
00:42:33,589 --> 00:42:36,549
so they know medication you're taking
well that's not that's good that's very

744
00:42:36,550 --> 00:42:37,609
helpful

745
00:42:37,609 --> 00:42:41,480
cogent act more safely member I Robot

746
00:42:41,480 --> 00:42:44,750
you know the Three Laws of Robotics

747
00:42:44,750 --> 00:42:48,160
so they can help you act more safely

748
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:51,180
so I can prevent you from doing things
that could hurt you

749
00:42:51,180 --> 00:42:55,049
that's a good thing right what I
recommend changes in behavior

750
00:42:55,050 --> 00:42:58,060
I'm not liking this very much so far on

751
00:42:58,060 --> 00:43:03,190
so using UPnP n product discovery
protocol which is fairly universal

752
00:43:03,190 --> 00:43:06,430
grace into stable operation so there
this is still under development

753
00:43:06,430 --> 00:43:10,049
I guess but don't worry they get the
money they'll figure out how to do it

754
00:43:10,050 --> 00:43:13,089
so this is independent of what I was
talking about the city but

755
00:43:13,089 --> 00:43:16,578
could be integrated with it very easily
on so his

756
00:43:16,579 --> 00:43:20,310
your I'm stealing stuff from one other
what are their web pages or a discussion

757
00:43:20,310 --> 00:43:20,869
about this

758
00:43:20,869 --> 00:43:24,990
something about this leaked out and then
a Google someone from Google denied it

759
00:43:24,990 --> 00:43:25,690
but then

760
00:43:25,690 --> 00:43:29,280
the there's a paper with a talk about it
arm

761
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:32,510
SQL database all those can't be hacked
uses

762
00:43:32,510 --> 00:43:36,790
event notification technology was forced
out as control variables at us

763
00:43:36,790 --> 00:43:40,480
comin home network device like computers
phones and TVs game consoles

764
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:43,530
booking 7 include other types sensors
nice

765
00:43:43,530 --> 00:43:47,200
cut off I stop Cup stop calling it so

766
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:52,020
yeah Google with the Google Glasses and
your Google web page in your Google

767
00:43:52,020 --> 00:43:55,150
gmail and everything Google

768
00:43:55,150 --> 00:43:59,130
arm so the that ups the ante a little

769
00:43:59,130 --> 00:44:03,780
I think and bat attack okay so let's say

770
00:44:03,780 --> 00:44:08,720
for the infrastructure mediated sensing
and this comes from the same researchers

771
00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:12,690
at University Washington right but said
the crypt

772
00:44:12,690 --> 00:44:16,349
they know that the privacy issue okay
I'm not saying they don't know that

773
00:44:16,349 --> 00:44:19,819
they do this privacy issue so they're
working on a crippling it so one the

774
00:44:19,819 --> 00:44:21,099
researchers said well what if

775
00:44:21,099 --> 00:44:24,640
what is a cryptid can you still find out
what's going on in the house and the

776
00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:25,160
answer is

777
00:44:25,160 --> 00:44:28,640
yes to a fingerprint and timing based

778
00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:32,490
snooping attack tek-tips /a side-channel
attack

779
00:44:32,490 --> 00:44:36,900
so you don't need to read the
transmissions from the individual

780
00:44:36,900 --> 00:44:40,140
infrastructure sensing devices

781
00:44:40,140 --> 00:44:44,319
you just have to know when the signals
come out

782
00:44:44,319 --> 00:44:48,560
so they say so they put motion sensors
so the basic research

783
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:52,770
without actually reading the signals
they were still able to read the terms

784
00:44:52,770 --> 00:44:53,420
they acted as a

785
00:44:53,420 --> 00:44:56,560
activities a daily life such a sleeping
bathroom kitchen visits bathroom

786
00:44:56,560 --> 00:44:57,400
activities

787
00:44:57,400 --> 00:45:01,079
catch activities and high-level health
information

788
00:45:01,079 --> 00:45:04,260
it's very sophisticated so you don't
have to read the signal you not to

789
00:45:04,260 --> 00:45:05,660
decode it

790
00:45:05,660 --> 00:45:08,828
you just have to know when the signal
occurred and where it came from

791
00:45:08,829 --> 00:45:11,839
see if you look at the fingerprint you
have to know what motion sensor or

792
00:45:11,839 --> 00:45:14,299
device it came from

793
00:45:14,300 --> 00:45:18,230
so that mean look at okay how do we
protect against that which is good

794
00:45:18,230 --> 00:45:21,579
so it's nice research being done this
and that they're looking at

795
00:45:21,579 --> 00:45:25,270
the attack and the defense the question
will be when these things actually gone

796
00:45:25,270 --> 00:45:26,390
production

797
00:45:26,390 --> 00:45:29,900
will these helpful to have these are not
so so the protectionist signal

798
00:45:29,900 --> 00:45:33,230
signal attenuators say send the signal
out

799
00:45:33,230 --> 00:45:37,920
not when the activity occurs but sup
some random time after that

800
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:41,160
rain delays are attenuated you reduce
the

801
00:45:41,160 --> 00:45:44,649
I'm sorry that's when you reduce the M
how far the signal goes

802
00:45:44,650 --> 00:45:47,960
periodic transmission so you don't so
you time it so incentive

803
00:45:47,960 --> 00:45:51,970
sending the signal when the activity
Kors you you time into every 15 minutes

804
00:45:51,970 --> 00:45:53,579
for every 20 minutes or whatever

805
00:45:53,579 --> 00:45:57,819
goes out so you can't %uh a used without
attack to

806
00:45:57,819 --> 00:46:01,800
correlate the timing of it with the
activity fingerprint masking

807
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:04,829
again arm I don't know if the only to UN

808
00:46:04,829 --> 00:46:08,819
NP um identify run of the mac address

809
00:46:08,819 --> 00:46:12,140
some other yep that you have to know
what devices coming from obviously

810
00:46:12,140 --> 00:46:15,839
so you you you you mask it somehow

811
00:46:15,839 --> 00:46:19,180
or you put in Fig transmissions so the
good news is he's

812
00:46:19,180 --> 00:46:23,109
these people art evil who are coming up
with things they are trying to do it for

813
00:46:23,109 --> 00:46:24,980
beneficial reasons

814
00:46:24,980 --> 00:46:29,720
they are thinking about some love the
negative uses ovett

815
00:46:29,720 --> 00:46:32,780
this a course doesn't protect against
the fact that the data is actually

816
00:46:32,780 --> 00:46:35,700
collected anyway and it's in a database
somewhere by

817
00:46:35,700 --> 00:46:39,609
their company or another company and the
day to cancel the actual traded

818
00:46:39,609 --> 00:46:43,130
were stolen or given to the government
or taken by the government

819
00:46:43,130 --> 00:46:46,180
but at this at least protects you from
someone scooping from outside the house

820
00:46:46,180 --> 00:46:50,089
if they put these in place

821
00:46:50,089 --> 00:46:53,299
but who would want this information so
the site after this from a discussion

822
00:46:53,300 --> 00:46:56,329
on now electric Smart Meters I'll go to
the whole thing

823
00:46:56,329 --> 00:47:00,890
not all the supply I couldn't give a
story for each of these

824
00:47:00,890 --> 00:47:04,200
on but across utility some talking to a
smart meter

825
00:47:04,200 --> 00:47:07,460
are but lot the still apply see

826
00:47:07,460 --> 00:47:10,510
so you get arm so soul for

827
00:47:10,510 --> 00:47:13,930
for water conservation what if up the

828
00:47:13,930 --> 00:47:18,379
a company that sells water conservation
devices or elector conservation are

829
00:47:18,380 --> 00:47:22,619
Natural Gas Conservation they get the
database and they figure out that

830
00:47:22,619 --> 00:47:27,339
here's a list to people in the city who
who are complying with the

831
00:47:27,339 --> 00:47:31,270
conservation requirements or that they
know want to conserve

832
00:47:31,270 --> 00:47:34,980
gas or electricity use or water more

833
00:47:34,980 --> 00:47:38,280
and they get a database initially signed
a marketing email or

834
00:47:38,280 --> 00:47:42,069
or mailing if they still use a lil our
law enforcers

835
00:47:42,069 --> 00:47:45,400
arm again there have been some cases

836
00:47:45,400 --> 00:47:48,890
arm where water use has been the

837
00:47:48,890 --> 00:47:53,848
that the FBI goes to the water utility
in fines owed excessive water use

838
00:47:53,849 --> 00:47:57,010
and says she may be there maybe they're
growing marijuana

839
00:47:57,010 --> 00:48:00,670
or maybe there cooking math because they
also higher

840
00:48:00,670 --> 00:48:05,180
electric use arm so this gives you more
fine-grained information

841
00:48:05,180 --> 00:48:09,720
but what if are you think someone's
holding someone hostage ur kidnapping

842
00:48:09,720 --> 00:48:12,910
that's a good thing but you can't take
it for major bear how many people in the

843
00:48:12,910 --> 00:48:13,348
house

844
00:48:13,349 --> 00:48:16,770
by looking at the water use electrocuted
cetera

845
00:48:16,770 --> 00:48:20,200
arm so there's a whole bunch love
potential uses

846
00:48:20,200 --> 00:48:23,900
that I couldn't pick up but it's
probably here somewhere

847
00:48:23,900 --> 00:48:27,690
and arts NCCA vices are to the market
yet it's hard to see

848
00:48:27,690 --> 00:48:32,369
and Ivan examples actually happening but
the bad news is that

849
00:48:32,369 --> 00:48:36,670
this information is collected even if we
can't think right now

850
00:48:36,670 --> 00:48:42,990
how could be used badly don't worry
somebody will

851
00:48:42,990 --> 00:48:47,670
okay so a bad way I'm in favor aye I
used to be work for environmental

852
00:48:47,670 --> 00:48:49,920
agencies and environmental groups ol

853
00:48:49,920 --> 00:48:53,200
water conservation is a good thing
general because even if you have plenty

854
00:48:53,200 --> 00:48:54,359
water quote-unquote

855
00:48:54,359 --> 00:48:58,750
any miss appellee it's not going to last
forever spot with population in business

856
00:48:58,750 --> 00:49:02,680
increasing so Walker fish is a good
thing however should be make people do

857
00:49:02,680 --> 00:49:03,230
it

858
00:49:03,230 --> 00:49:07,069
well a lot Cup sometimes you have to
make people do it

859
00:49:07,069 --> 00:49:11,040
I have to have a law how do you enforce
a law very hard

860
00:49:11,040 --> 00:49:14,300
so are some examples our San Francisco

861
00:49:14,300 --> 00:49:17,990
LA architects is a lead certification

862
00:49:17,990 --> 00:49:21,720
I don't member the acronym stands for
but we're a building is is energy

863
00:49:21,720 --> 00:49:26,369
and environmentally efficient and and
and conservation wise

864
00:49:26,369 --> 00:49:30,180
so what if arm the building its pockets

865
00:49:30,180 --> 00:49:34,180
X s now regular part putting in a
building is these water meter

866
00:49:34,180 --> 00:49:37,190
what hyder sense and lighter sentence on

867
00:49:37,190 --> 00:49:40,650
I'll wanna throughout the building codes
because it's now a community

868
00:49:40,650 --> 00:49:45,380
our priority to reduce use arm

869
00:49:45,380 --> 00:49:48,960
what I think the biggest threat would be
probably that dot is first in california

870
00:49:48,960 --> 00:49:50,290
which is under strict

871
00:49:50,290 --> 00:49:53,670
requirements to reduce water use 20
percent by 2020

872
00:49:53,670 --> 00:49:58,400
which is very hard to do once you've
eliminated watering lawns if you can

873
00:49:58,400 --> 00:50:01,819
and are easy thanks arm

874
00:50:01,819 --> 00:50:05,920
it looks like a a natural for me that
California would require

875
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:10,410
municipalities to meet the requirement
miss a palace to meet it would say

876
00:50:10,410 --> 00:50:14,839
okay landlord congo owner I am building
superintendents

877
00:50:14,839 --> 00:50:19,210
you have to require your tenants to put
these things in so you can monitor

878
00:50:19,210 --> 00:50:23,150
are the water use and then slap their
hands or required to do things to meet

879
00:50:23,150 --> 00:50:24,270
the requirement

880
00:50:24,270 --> 00:50:27,869
i think thats for the most likely are

881
00:50:27,869 --> 00:50:31,510
the way this will be applied

882
00:50:31,510 --> 00:50:35,390
but again these are the market yet so
we'll see force better living

883
00:50:35,390 --> 00:50:38,509
okay I my favorite movie for this is a
course on

884
00:50:38,510 --> 00:50:41,880
demolition man course and %uh

885
00:50:41,880 --> 00:50:45,390
there there there's a lot pasan in
middle on Massachusetts to

886
00:50:45,390 --> 00:50:48,690
to prohibit public swearing now they
don't have these

887
00:50:48,690 --> 00:50:52,440
had a little devices that they listen to
you and give you a fine

888
00:50:52,440 --> 00:50:56,180
and it's very its what

889
00:50:56,180 --> 00:51:00,509
yes that's right so that's very useful
device for us serve us for their

890
00:51:00,510 --> 00:51:05,150
I so worried running outta time now so I
read all this but done

891
00:51:05,150 --> 00:51:08,800
%uh so there are there are regulations
out there that look at

892
00:51:08,800 --> 00:51:12,309
the intrusive to what you do in your
home to protect people

893
00:51:12,309 --> 00:51:15,520
and this could be way doing at use a
large force meant

894
00:51:15,520 --> 00:51:19,230
okay Minority Report pre crime well
obviously we're not gonna have three

895
00:51:19,230 --> 00:51:22,730
cocks doing this but the FBI is looking
at using big data

896
00:51:22,730 --> 00:51:27,079
to look at activity outside the home but
maybe the keys inside the home

897
00:51:27,079 --> 00:51:30,970
you put the day together and you can
figure out things

898
00:51:30,970 --> 00:51:34,589
that may or may not be accurate for
example target there's a big story out

899
00:51:34,589 --> 00:51:38,020
no well those that I caught target has
figured out a way

900
00:51:38,020 --> 00:51:41,530
target up stores that sell other things

901
00:51:41,530 --> 00:51:45,890
but when a woman is pregnant based upon
if they buy she buys a few things

902
00:51:45,890 --> 00:51:49,710
they know before she does or husband
anyway that she's pregnant

903
00:51:49,710 --> 00:51:53,540
and it was accurate this in one case
which was created the story

904
00:51:53,540 --> 00:51:56,920
that's the only example I know where you
could put all this data together and

905
00:51:56,920 --> 00:51:57,510
suddenly

906
00:51:57,510 --> 00:52:02,910
bomb so sure the FBI's I get GetData
crackers working on that right now

907
00:52:02,910 --> 00:52:06,319
a good and very quickly here I apologize
that the conclusions

908
00:52:06,319 --> 00:52:10,720
okay this this number six again
beginning at the show

909
00:52:10,720 --> 00:52:14,109
are and there's Tom Cruise a course arm

910
00:52:14,109 --> 00:52:17,270
so there are benefits from these nothing
that they're not

911
00:52:17,270 --> 00:52:20,540
are but like anything else hall

912
00:52:20,540 --> 00:52:24,450
you know what could go wrong and there
are serious privacy issues that could

913
00:52:24,450 --> 00:52:25,730
result

914
00:52:25,730 --> 00:52:29,099
I'll and security again if somebody
knows what's going home

915
00:52:29,099 --> 00:52:32,640
arm and you know they're doing it they
could take offense to that

916
00:52:32,640 --> 00:52:37,150
and is a privately Richter scale it's
not really a 9.5 because is not here yet

917
00:52:37,150 --> 00:52:40,190
%uh the utility manufacture Belkin it

918
00:52:40,190 --> 00:52:43,990
bought the higher sense so that may be
coming on the market soon

919
00:52:43,990 --> 00:52:47,020
and finally I don't think we're gonna
get 1984 but

920
00:52:47,020 --> 00:52:51,720
double will be like the prisoner with
cameras and and monitors everywhere

921
00:52:51,720 --> 00:52:52,790
be seeing you thank you
