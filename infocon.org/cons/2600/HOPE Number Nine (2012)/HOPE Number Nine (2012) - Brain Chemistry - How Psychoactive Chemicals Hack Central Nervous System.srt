1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,879
scissor as as the talks progress in the
morning and more more people start

2
00:00:03,879 --> 00:00:05,400
showing up in the air as they wake up

3
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:09,769
on we were all pretty late last night
and which might be a relevant to the

4
00:00:09,769 --> 00:00:10,700
topic at this

5
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:14,080
this talk brain chemistry how
psychoactive chemicals hackers central

6
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:14,839
nervous system

7
00:00:14,839 --> 00:00:20,359
I'm I don't know maybe it's all
theoretical and I was nervous have been

8
00:00:20,359 --> 00:00:24,840
experiment was a collective on
substances in

9
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:27,990
butter Jennifer here is is a passion

10
00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:31,760
hers because she's been studying a on

11
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:35,890
from ecology for and a half dozen years
you'll soon be a pharmacist

12
00:00:35,890 --> 00:00:39,800
so she really knows her material and

13
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:44,160
I imagine some others have some personal
experience in this area as well butter

14
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:47,370
on the house in the winds could be a

15
00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:51,149
could be particularly interesting Silom
I just want to

16
00:00:51,149 --> 00:00:55,300
welcome Jennifer to hold and a looking
forward to the stock

17
00:00:55,300 --> 00:01:01,379
thanks home

18
00:01:01,379 --> 00:01:04,780
thank you mom the third i'm jennifer

19
00:01:04,780 --> 00:01:08,180
welcome to brain chemistry mom

20
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:12,100
I just finished the my doctor pharmacy
degree so

21
00:01:12,100 --> 00:01:15,680
on I'm happy about that and

22
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:22,680
thank you with a lot of work time do im
gonna focus on how stuff works

23
00:01:23,979 --> 00:01:27,929
um so on

24
00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:31,020
over there is my cold virus friend
because I

25
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:34,548
spoke at a the last open mom

26
00:01:34,549 --> 00:01:40,590
he's watching to make sure I do their
job so minister was something that

27
00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:44,520
on amuse me lies on a toxicology
rotation

28
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:48,548
this is mom scratch remover

29
00:01:48,549 --> 00:01:52,450
ridge's DEA DEA compliant on

30
00:01:52,450 --> 00:01:56,170
it sir strictly not for human
consumption

31
00:01:56,170 --> 00:02:01,840
it's legal in all states does not
contain LSD cocaine MDMA at Bella mean

32
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:06,500
any of that stuff on year's honors like
called

33
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:11,550
buzz wholesale a I'm sure this is in no
way

34
00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:16,310
any sort of you know front or
psychoactive substance a

35
00:02:16,310 --> 00:02:23,170
any kind so how r drugs like acting

36
00:02:23,170 --> 00:02:26,940
well we have a link an existing
biochemical network

37
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:29,959
with our you know brains and nervous
system

38
00:02:29,959 --> 00:02:33,910
some and dole's communique chemically

39
00:02:33,910 --> 00:02:37,709
on sold drugs being chemicals can hijack

40
00:02:37,709 --> 00:02:41,629
various cellular communications and
other processes

41
00:02:41,629 --> 00:02:46,989
on some the ways they can do that is by
binding to receptors

42
00:02:46,989 --> 00:02:51,540
receptors like are you know functions
and programming

43
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:56,260
basically a cell have receptors on the
outside ovens membrane

44
00:02:56,260 --> 00:02:59,859
and and chemicals can buy into that

45
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:04,800
and Unani inside the cell stuff happens
depending on the cell and depending

46
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:05,300
which

47
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:09,319
receptor all that stuff so arm

48
00:03:09,319 --> 00:03:14,019
there are agonists which activate
receptors antagonised

49
00:03:14,019 --> 00:03:17,290
which blog receptors home

50
00:03:17,290 --> 00:03:20,540
other things drugs can do is either

51
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:24,940
change chemical transport chemical
synthesis

52
00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:28,049
my metabolism things the release

53
00:03:28,049 --> 00:03:31,920
neurotransmitters and such gene
expression

54
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:38,920
and anything else that's biochemical
were just landed defining

55
00:03:39,580 --> 00:03:43,400
I'm going to you focus on the central
nervous system

56
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:47,280
the CNS com this is the brain and spinal
cord

57
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:51,739
its and read here and that supposed to
the peripheral nervous system

58
00:03:51,739 --> 00:03:54,980
which is in blue and that everything
else

59
00:03:54,980 --> 00:03:58,939
so

60
00:03:58,939 --> 00:04:02,280
first thing is your brain is firewalled

61
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:05,280
basically I'm

62
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:09,120
it's very selective about getting mom

63
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:13,420
the transfer stuff from a blood to cells
is selective

64
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:18,209
and the transfer stuff from a blunder
for the brain is particularly selective

65
00:04:18,209 --> 00:04:19,680
because your brain

66
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:24,830
and spinal cord or very important I'm so
in this diagram we have a

67
00:04:24,830 --> 00:04:29,050
capillary in red and then the brain
cells

68
00:04:29,050 --> 00:04:32,490
attached to it are in bloom home

69
00:04:32,490 --> 00:04:35,930
and the endothelial cells other one
surrounding the

70
00:04:35,930 --> 00:04:39,400
blood vessel and they create a barrier

71
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:43,960
everything has to go through them to get
into the brain

72
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:47,560
on

73
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:51,410
so on this diagram on the top that's
where the blood is on the bottom is the

74
00:04:51,410 --> 00:04:52,330
brain cells

75
00:04:52,330 --> 00:04:57,150
and your the endothelial cells just
showing the different ways

76
00:04:57,150 --> 00:05:00,970
that stuff can get through mom mama left

77
00:05:00,970 --> 00:05:04,669
on staff early no water soluble

78
00:05:04,669 --> 00:05:09,099
small stop some things can get through
tight junctions

79
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:12,500
home find this all together mom

80
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:16,470
there's also some stuff can go all the
way through the cell

81
00:05:16,470 --> 00:05:22,180
mom and on the right cDNA you're just
various ways that stuff can be

82
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:24,139
transported through the cell

83
00:05:24,139 --> 00:05:27,949
most other drugs on we're talking about

84
00:05:27,949 --> 00:05:33,350
would fall under Category B or not fall
under and if it doesn't get him to

85
00:05:33,350 --> 00:05:37,169
the CNS mom generally

86
00:05:37,169 --> 00:05:40,258
they have to be small that soluble

87
00:05:40,259 --> 00:05:43,770
mom and nonpolar on my

88
00:05:43,770 --> 00:05:48,099
in my last time I actually did a
demonstration that decide not to do this

89
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:48,900
year

90
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:53,810
mom having to do with acids and bases
and solubility

91
00:05:53,810 --> 00:05:57,770
a kind Obama ended up like vinegar and
baking soda

92
00:05:57,770 --> 00:06:01,590
because and exploded mergers

93
00:06:01,590 --> 00:06:05,190
fun not messy Anna and

94
00:06:05,190 --> 00:06:08,660
basically the om be

95
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:14,340
on using acids and bases you can change
the solubility up some molecules

96
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:18,400
which is useful because the skin a bad
weather across the blood-brain barrier

97
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:19,310
not

98
00:06:19,310 --> 00:06:23,280
aspirin is an acid which does cross

99
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:27,780
mom buda in cases of overdose it's
useful to

100
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:31,050
arm to raise the pH a blood

101
00:06:31,050 --> 00:06:34,949
make a more basic mom because that makes
it more

102
00:06:34,949 --> 00:06:40,110
water-soluble and done and it doesn't
cross is easily that way

103
00:06:40,110 --> 00:06:44,110
homes also excreted more easily

104
00:06:44,110 --> 00:06:47,190
arm to recycle active a drug

105
00:06:47,190 --> 00:06:51,120
has to get into the central nervous
system has to get to the brain to affect

106
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:52,580
the brain

107
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:55,800
that's why this is important mom

108
00:06:55,800 --> 00:07:00,349
we really use that to our advantage and
developing drugs

109
00:07:00,349 --> 00:07:04,909
on the left on will these diagrams just
to mention

110
00:07:04,910 --> 00:07:08,060
days you com haven't seen them before

111
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:11,569
the lines are bonds between carbons arm

112
00:07:11,569 --> 00:07:15,289
and then and czar hydrogens owner
oxygens

113
00:07:15,289 --> 00:07:18,479
and mom CL is chlorine

114
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:21,568
com solo una left is mostly carbons on

115
00:07:21,569 --> 00:07:25,030
to each other it's very that soluble

116
00:07:25,030 --> 00:07:29,300
goes into the central nervous system it
has its any his demeanor backs

117
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:32,750
both in and outside of a central nervous
system

118
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:36,849
on and wanna lose a fax is to make you
very drowsy

119
00:07:36,849 --> 00:07:40,539
just like your benadryl or night well

120
00:07:40,539 --> 00:07:44,599
those also have any histamine they're
like this mom

121
00:07:44,599 --> 00:07:48,620
and and that's an embankment is on the
brain

122
00:07:48,620 --> 00:07:52,550
on the right we have cleared in loretta
Dean

123
00:07:52,550 --> 00:07:55,819
which is made were polar

124
00:07:55,819 --> 00:07:59,580
by the Niger dans the oxygens and the
koreans

125
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:02,699
they draw electrons themselves lower

126
00:08:02,699 --> 00:08:06,259
so changes the distribution of charges
on the molecule

127
00:08:06,259 --> 00:08:10,360
and so doesn't really cross the brain
barrier much

128
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:13,680
on so doesn't make people drowsy

129
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:19,509
like the old ones do very useful

130
00:08:19,509 --> 00:08:22,629
so burned told me while back

131
00:08:22,629 --> 00:08:26,930
when I was talking about ethanol that a
she thought at the mall on the gamma

132
00:08:26,930 --> 00:08:31,300
agonists would make a good band name

133
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:35,880
on I am I don't know it kinda has a nice
ring to it

134
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:39,990
on I'm gonna talk about admiral
transmitter got Gabbana

135
00:08:39,990 --> 00:08:45,480
com but first we have to understand
action potentials

136
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:49,029
so revolving illustrations like the one
on the left

137
00:08:49,029 --> 00:08:53,230
on I know you have because their to use
the same one earlier

138
00:08:53,230 --> 00:08:57,230
in this presentation

139
00:08:57,230 --> 00:09:01,529
Google flashy it shows the electrical
signals moving through an hour on

140
00:09:01,529 --> 00:09:05,759
mom and on the right is more you know
technical diagram

141
00:09:05,759 --> 00:09:10,560
that shows the voltage that goes through
the cell when it fires

142
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:15,649
the firing isn't action potential and
either happens or doesn't

143
00:09:15,649 --> 00:09:19,499
but how does this happen chemically

144
00:09:19,499 --> 00:09:22,529
and the answer is

145
00:09:22,529 --> 00:09:25,660
on through magnetism with ions

146
00:09:25,660 --> 00:09:29,499
the main ones and bombed or sodium

147
00:09:29,499 --> 00:09:33,509
which is positively charged potassium

148
00:09:33,509 --> 00:09:37,309
on and chloride which is negative mom

149
00:09:37,309 --> 00:09:40,920
and they generally get across the cell
membrane

150
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:44,589
on numbers you have channels they can go
through

151
00:09:44,589 --> 00:09:48,639
so on the bottom I just ever
illustration there're

152
00:09:48,639 --> 00:09:51,790
on homes on that nerve cells that

153
00:09:51,790 --> 00:09:56,180
mom they're basically keep potassium

154
00:09:56,180 --> 00:09:59,809
on the inside and sodium on the outside

155
00:09:59,809 --> 00:10:06,219
the cell generals also maintained

156
00:10:06,220 --> 00:10:09,740
and a other arresting

157
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:12,850
voltage about negative 7e

158
00:10:12,850 --> 00:10:16,540
Mila bowls on summed up the you know

159
00:10:16,540 --> 00:10:20,589
potassium inside the sodium outside in
its and a negative

160
00:10:20,589 --> 00:10:26,240
charge mom stimulus changes that you can
make it

161
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:32,100
more positive but the stimulus has to be
strong enough to get it to you about -55

162
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:33,000
mobile

163
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:37,360
mom and then at that point there are
channels

164
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:41,009
sodium channels which are sensitive to
voltage

165
00:10:41,009 --> 00:10:45,050
so those open up one reaches the d5

166
00:10:45,050 --> 00:10:48,339
there's a cascade and although sodium
channels

167
00:10:48,339 --> 00:10:53,309
respond in the Alban open up and sodium
rushes into those I'll

168
00:10:53,309 --> 00:10:58,139
now so we got all these positive charges
are coming into the cell

169
00:10:58,139 --> 00:11:02,160
the sell only comes positive

170
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:05,309
home you know at that point

171
00:11:05,309 --> 00:11:10,269
the Mena sodium channel start to close
and potassium channels open

172
00:11:10,269 --> 00:11:13,410
com so you get up to no

173
00:11:13,410 --> 00:11:17,800
that peak their om and then potassium
starts

174
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:21,500
leaving the cell mom the channels open

175
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:24,600
and soul than the voltage goes back down

176
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:29,949
mom so the new bill actually overshoots
a little bit goes more negative

177
00:11:29,949 --> 00:11:33,579
mom and then it got you

178
00:11:33,579 --> 00:11:37,730
sodium on the inside potassium on the
outside and those palms start

179
00:11:37,730 --> 00:11:40,889
resetting things by exchanging those two

180
00:11:40,889 --> 00:11:47,730
no chemical transistor

181
00:11:47,730 --> 00:11:51,410
yes they're not him

182
00:11:51,410 --> 00:11:54,719
angelenos million with electronics on

183
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:58,699
yeah it makes sense I think it's a it's
a good

184
00:11:58,699 --> 00:12:02,799
you know it's an interesting mechanism I
find it interesting anyway

185
00:12:02,799 --> 00:12:09,799
which is why I'm talking about it one
would hope I find it interesting

186
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:13,670
her is so back to gamma

187
00:12:13,670 --> 00:12:17,149
and how those words gamers

188
00:12:17,149 --> 00:12:20,240
and inhibits action potentials

189
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:24,559
so as all sorts of other the president
tax drowsiness

190
00:12:24,559 --> 00:12:28,329
relax Asian anti-anxiety effects

191
00:12:28,329 --> 00:12:31,569
mom and gamma agonists

192
00:12:31,569 --> 00:12:37,269
near ethanol so a banal as other actions
besides Gabba but that's my numbers

193
00:12:37,269 --> 00:12:40,670
big ones cell causes sedation

194
00:12:40,670 --> 00:12:44,729
on benzyl does like billions and eggs

195
00:12:44,730 --> 00:12:48,230
hypnotics like ambien Burbage your words

196
00:12:48,230 --> 00:12:52,699
ProBook Paul they are they have a
backgammon

197
00:12:52,699 --> 00:12:55,980
slows things down makes nerves less
likely to fire

198
00:12:55,980 --> 00:12:59,160
so the MIA receptor

199
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:04,230
is a chloride channel mom so what
happens now this works chemically

200
00:13:04,230 --> 00:13:08,569
is that a is that you know gamma

201
00:13:08,569 --> 00:13:13,179
or other things i buy into it open up
the channel and Mike chloride into the

202
00:13:13,179 --> 00:13:13,709
cell

203
00:13:13,709 --> 00:13:17,029
so that makes them more negative it
might you know be

204
00:13:17,029 --> 00:13:21,089
-70 Mila Belson you know with more
chloride a good to go to

205
00:13:21,089 --> 00:13:24,829
negative a hundred or whatever so it's
gonna be

206
00:13:24,829 --> 00:13:29,490
harder to make the action potential
happen

207
00:13:29,490 --> 00:13:34,160
and I do every experimental
demonstration here

208
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:37,969
you

209
00:13:37,970 --> 00:13:41,319
on that is less messy then

210
00:13:41,319 --> 00:13:48,319
good

211
00:13:50,689 --> 00:13:57,689
you

212
00:14:12,210 --> 00:14:14,970
have again %uh yes oh

213
00:14:14,970 --> 00:14:18,930
mom I know when I was a kid i love
studying up dominoes

214
00:14:18,930 --> 00:14:23,000
action potentials are kinda like that
because they either go or don't

215
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:26,830
and you push a domino over you know

216
00:14:26,830 --> 00:14:31,920
maybe push it to a certain you know
party falls over reviewed owner doesn't

217
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:32,700
fall over

218
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:36,000
a so got

219
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,660
waits on the back to have these I am

220
00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:43,990
so obviously there's a certain point
where it pushes overheard it would not

221
00:14:43,990 --> 00:14:44,960
all these over

222
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:49,390
a but if I add way to the back to this

223
00:14:49,390 --> 00:14:54,430
it's much harder to push over so it
takes more

224
00:14:54,430 --> 00:14:58,440
have to move it more distance before
it'll actually fall over

225
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:03,090
so the action potentials welivetogether
sorta like that

226
00:15:03,090 --> 00:15:06,800
and just for fun good

227
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:11,100
those less messy than mine volcano thing

228
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:16,250
anyway

229
00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:20,310
as though there's another I'm

230
00:15:20,310 --> 00:15:24,610
neurotransmitter called glutamate that
sorta works the opposite of Gabbar

231
00:15:24,610 --> 00:15:29,620
mom which

232
00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:33,470
applies to this case other Z on

233
00:15:33,470 --> 00:15:37,680
alert thing I am learned a lot about on
toxicology rotation

234
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:42,820
mom there are k2 spice or

235
00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:46,120
product names worry pseudo legal

236
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:50,160
on Kanab annoyed and they're basically

237
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:54,280
synthetically they bind to the same
receptors marijuana

238
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:57,350
mom my hand her

239
00:15:57,350 --> 00:16:00,640
and they're basically the product is
basically plant material sprayed down

240
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:02,230
with these chemicals they were

241
00:16:02,230 --> 00:16:05,300
invented for researched an unmodified

242
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:09,180
by chemist to skirt the law mom

243
00:16:09,180 --> 00:16:12,890
and the poison centers gottman on calls

244
00:16:12,890 --> 00:16:15,990
about these recently mom

245
00:16:15,990 --> 00:16:19,250
on a in on rotation

246
00:16:19,250 --> 00:16:22,510
now we've seen people come into the ER
with seizures

247
00:16:22,510 --> 00:16:25,890
we don't really I'm sure lobby balloon

248
00:16:25,890 --> 00:16:28,949
term smokeless and not gotten seizures
but

249
00:16:28,950 --> 00:16:32,770
com but compared to marijuana we are
lazy people come in

250
00:16:32,770 --> 00:16:36,420
with seizures marijuana but with the
stuff that's are you have been a regular

251
00:16:36,420 --> 00:16:37,400
occurrence

252
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:41,830
fuller's numbers dinners know why why
this dark causes seizures

253
00:16:41,830 --> 00:16:45,560
home and I research that a little bit
com

254
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:48,680
it turns out PHCs any good balls an
activity

255
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:52,330
com its effect on the Canaanite receptor

256
00:16:52,330 --> 00:16:56,400
inhibits both Gabba and gloomy Sony Open
in gamma

257
00:16:56,400 --> 00:17:01,330
makes it more make you more likely to
season in Durban including me

258
00:17:01,330 --> 00:17:08,079
makes you less like did to seize but its
part have a stronger back on the gloomy

259
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:11,109
are than that it can analyze no

260
00:17:11,110 --> 00:17:15,680
I love them are more potent sometimes
more than five times more potent

261
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:19,800
on sobra they have a stronger affect on
yepper

262
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:24,480
so they were

263
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:28,030
hmm talk a little bit about pain goes

264
00:17:28,030 --> 00:17:31,280
penalized by painkillers interesting on

265
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:37,060
the movie a common mechanisms like I've
been asked me for

266
00:17:37,060 --> 00:17:40,770
com you know how there certainly
painkillers their

267
00:17:40,770 --> 00:17:44,500
just numb you like money go to the
dentist and again my dick a net

268
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:47,850
just makes you numb and clearly there
are some others that

269
00:17:47,850 --> 00:17:51,679
don't know me you mom summer lozer

270
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:54,720
are anti-inflammatories solely inhibit

271
00:17:54,720 --> 00:18:00,290
prostate gland ins which cause pain and
sensitize your nerves when I am

272
00:18:00,290 --> 00:18:04,100
like on tissue damage when you're sore

273
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:07,150
mom but if someone were to him

274
00:18:07,150 --> 00:18:11,600
stab you or something when you take an
anti-inflammatory it's really not gonna

275
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:12,910
make much difference

276
00:18:12,910 --> 00:18:16,230
is that for acute pain for dinner

277
00:18:16,230 --> 00:18:19,300
centrally acting a ones as well

278
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:22,909
and the CNS actually has has pathways

279
00:18:22,910 --> 00:18:26,680
obviously going from the body to your
brain which

280
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:31,510
transmits the pain signal and then it
has descending pathways that go from

281
00:18:31,510 --> 00:18:32,480
your brain

282
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:37,000
down your body and and the kids that
have the ability to inhibit

283
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:44,000
pain signals so does some basic gonna

284
00:18:44,990 --> 00:18:49,330
some other centrally acting ones
obedience

285
00:18:49,330 --> 00:18:53,030
will be allowed they buy into opioid
receptors

286
00:18:53,030 --> 00:18:58,010
and mom pretty much like the ultimate we
have an effect on

287
00:18:58,010 --> 00:19:01,520
gloomy in the spinal cord so they
inhibited

288
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:06,730
and again unnerves Ernests was likely to
fire their

289
00:19:06,730 --> 00:19:11,070
mom there's also a couple unique
substances letter

290
00:19:11,070 --> 00:19:14,070
will be avoided but also on a bag

291
00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:17,340
serotonin and/or nor pan-african

292
00:19:17,340 --> 00:19:22,159
those neurotransmitters also seem to
have an effect on pain

293
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:25,350
but you never know I'd also those are
still being

294
00:19:25,350 --> 00:19:28,960
investigated not real clear with the
mechanism is

295
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:32,440
mom neuropathic pain is pain

296
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:35,770
from nerve damage so the OB idler

297
00:19:35,770 --> 00:19:38,870
Musab active mom but stop it affects

298
00:19:38,870 --> 00:19:44,310
serotonin or never in on is often
helpful for that

299
00:19:44,310 --> 00:19:48,290
mom and then there's acetaminophen which
is

300
00:19:48,290 --> 00:19:51,790
I know but something it's an
anti-inflammatory but in the central

301
00:19:51,790 --> 00:19:53,440
nervous system instead a

302
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:58,410
outside a bit like ibuprofen

303
00:19:58,410 --> 00:20:02,060
again on using the blood-brain barrier
to

304
00:20:02,060 --> 00:20:05,280
art vintage OB reader

305
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:08,440
dollar beers others in the gun

306
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:12,040
so opioids slowdown your gut

307
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:16,710
and they can cause constipation on a
course constipation

308
00:20:16,710 --> 00:20:19,910
would be great if I don't like to have
it you had diarrhea

309
00:20:19,910 --> 00:20:23,640
and there is over-the-counter MOTM

310
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:26,970
will pay remind on which on

311
00:20:26,970 --> 00:20:30,560
is I'm three-member diarrhea

312
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:34,399
it binds to be obra receptors

313
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:38,020
mom but it doesn't really get into the
central nervous system

314
00:20:38,020 --> 00:20:42,010
so has that peripheral backed but
doesn't have the

315
00:20:42,010 --> 00:20:45,110
OPI to back that others you

316
00:20:45,110 --> 00:20:49,370
so it doesn't feel pain ur yes that you
hire

317
00:20:49,370 --> 00:20:52,510
anything com actually

318
00:20:52,510 --> 00:20:57,250
someone actually does cross global look
blood-brain barrier but thats

319
00:20:57,250 --> 00:21:00,800
come back out mom by

320
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:05,380
p-glycoprotein on so it sorta like if
you have a

321
00:21:05,380 --> 00:21:10,370
a boat that's leaking a little bit
nearby bids you can get the water out

322
00:21:10,370 --> 00:21:13,540
mom in most it's coming in just

323
00:21:13,540 --> 00:21:18,180
now too fast but home generally stays on
the CNS

324
00:21:18,180 --> 00:21:21,280
there're some chemicals out there that
inhibit

325
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:24,910
p glycoprotein such as Canadian

326
00:21:24,910 --> 00:21:28,430
and all that allows some repair my dad's
day in the CNS

327
00:21:28,430 --> 00:21:32,730
and head I am CNS effects

328
00:21:32,730 --> 00:21:36,730
Witcher Michael be i'd

329
00:21:36,730 --> 00:21:42,180
another interesting toxicology case a
brilliant way too excited about these

330
00:21:42,180 --> 00:21:47,060
him I murder there was a lady your game
in Angier

331
00:21:47,060 --> 00:21:52,790
head OD Don will pair mine she took
about two hundred of them

332
00:21:52,790 --> 00:21:56,620
over like the best couple days

333
00:21:56,620 --> 00:21:59,720
yahoo.com

334
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:03,580
Louis the media concern and I'm usually
with a

335
00:22:03,580 --> 00:22:06,870
legacy was trying to detox herself from

336
00:22:06,870 --> 00:22:09,880
mom no from other opiates

337
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:13,370
are using will pay ride in

338
00:22:13,370 --> 00:22:16,670
arm it's not unheard apparently but

339
00:22:16,670 --> 00:22:22,390
on the her the usual concern for
toxicologist with

340
00:22:22,390 --> 00:22:28,190
overdoses in opioids is respiratory
depression your breathing slows down in

341
00:22:28,190 --> 00:22:31,490
that happens for too long even that were
damaged

342
00:22:31,490 --> 00:22:36,140
brain damage eventually died on but with
her there is a much more pressing

343
00:22:36,140 --> 00:22:37,560
problem for

344
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:40,810
heart going into biz arrhythmia called

345
00:22:40,810 --> 00:22:44,530
tours on on twisting other points

346
00:22:44,530 --> 00:22:47,700
mom looks like a party streamer on the

347
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:50,880
UGG home Anna

348
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:56,040
could be in effect from when a team
although she tested negative recorded 18

349
00:22:56,040 --> 00:23:01,530
they actually had a shocker 15 times
because he kept going into this rhythm

350
00:23:01,530 --> 00:23:04,580
mom there was interesting as on

351
00:23:04,580 --> 00:23:08,040
you know we all know what caused it
village it could have been

352
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:12,580
be low barrier might itself because we
really don't know we don't do tests

353
00:23:12,580 --> 00:23:18,310
you know to undergo provides on human
subjects that are

354
00:23:18,310 --> 00:23:21,629
for moving on

355
00:23:21,630 --> 00:23:26,900
d'amato means nor been up for in
dopamine and serotonin

356
00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:30,720
mom a lot of psychoactive drugs am

357
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:34,470
me final ample means structure on

358
00:23:34,470 --> 00:23:37,640
this is you know the final graying

359
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:40,700
Apple's two carbons and I mean is the

360
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:45,410
nitrogen mom an iron ore transmitters
norba never nando

361
00:23:45,410 --> 00:23:49,320
me have a structure

362
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:52,730
so you can see some patterns with bomb
on

363
00:23:52,730 --> 00:23:56,370
various psychoactive substances
including

364
00:23:56,370 --> 00:24:01,290
on a you know summoner prescription and
some that are you legal

365
00:24:01,290 --> 00:24:04,770
mom they are others but the level mean

366
00:24:04,770 --> 00:24:08,900
final at the war mean structure mom

367
00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:12,560
which gives them some activity is to do
with

368
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:17,899
neural transmission

369
00:24:17,900 --> 00:24:21,810
so on back in the fifties

370
00:24:21,810 --> 00:24:25,210
I believe on a

371
00:24:25,210 --> 00:24:28,540
there was noticed that a that mono
marine

372
00:24:28,540 --> 00:24:32,930
oxidase inhibitors the they basically
inhibit the metabolism

373
00:24:32,930 --> 00:24:37,010
monoamines the serotonin dopamine
norepinephrine

374
00:24:37,010 --> 00:24:41,930
com Solaire leads to more bones nerve
transmissions

375
00:24:41,930 --> 00:24:45,460
transmitters in your brain com and that

376
00:24:45,460 --> 00:24:51,930
lead to they notice that these on help
people who were clinically depressed

377
00:24:51,930 --> 00:24:55,640
which allegedly a monoamine hypothesis

378
00:24:55,640 --> 00:25:00,360
which is that on you know what deeper
when you're depressed do you have

379
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:03,660
low levels mono means

380
00:25:03,660 --> 00:25:07,830
and and only need two persons have been

381
00:25:07,830 --> 00:25:13,090
are developed you know about these
monoamines and they increase the

382
00:25:13,090 --> 00:25:17,050
amount ovett in a synapse the thing is
that

383
00:25:17,050 --> 00:25:22,050
be increase happens pretty quickly you
know you take your

384
00:25:22,050 --> 00:25:26,000
no prozac or something in and it
absorbed into your bloodstream into

385
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,660
goods and your brain

386
00:25:27,660 --> 00:25:30,960
and that same day starts to go back to
serotonin

387
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:35,920
on it inhibits the reuptake slurs mourn
the synapse

388
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:42,040
but it takes weeks to get the
antidepressant back to go long-term

389
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:45,230
om affect against clinical depression

390
00:25:45,230 --> 00:25:48,580
and the past couple decades there's been
a new hypothesis

391
00:25:48,580 --> 00:25:51,919
that's been gaining momentum which is
that

392
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:55,510
it's really involving neurogenesis Lee

393
00:25:55,510 --> 00:25:58,980
the growth of new neurons in the
hippocampus

394
00:25:58,980 --> 00:26:04,300
on this is a normal process on but
there's evidence that people were

395
00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:08,030
depressed urban long-term anxiety or
bipolar

396
00:26:08,030 --> 00:26:12,070
on have diminished neurogenesis

397
00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:15,750
and it's discovered that antidepressants
om

398
00:26:15,750 --> 00:26:18,870
ultimately result in more

399
00:26:18,870 --> 00:26:22,000
near on bro them depressed patients

400
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:25,130
on so there's evidence that this is why
they work

401
00:26:25,130 --> 00:26:30,550
and that this is and a backwards
downstream of the effect on monoamines

402
00:26:30,550 --> 00:26:35,120
com other things that help depression
know their pee in exercise they also

403
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:37,070
have a biochemical

404
00:26:37,070 --> 00:26:40,840
affect on our services them in our
brains

405
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:43,990
mom hands that they can also increase

406
00:26:43,990 --> 00:26:47,390
neurogenesis so

407
00:26:47,390 --> 00:26:50,840
this is still being investigated more
but it's

408
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:54,070
very interesting me hmm

409
00:26:54,070 --> 00:26:59,560
home another incident them using the
blood-brain barrier

410
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:03,040
on with monoamines

411
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:06,159
on a parkinson's we treat

412
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:09,660
we can treat dopamine mom and

413
00:27:09,660 --> 00:27:14,070
dopamine doesn't cross so we have to use
L-dopa which is a precursor

414
00:27:14,070 --> 00:27:17,450
mom the Breakers organs metabolized in
the body

415
00:27:17,450 --> 00:27:22,820
to dopamine home moving is a dopamine
has laws i'd a bag that has long

416
00:27:22,820 --> 00:27:26,629
you in the brain we can really help that
and has some side effects

417
00:27:26,630 --> 00:27:31,110
on the heart on blood pressure stop
that's outside over

418
00:27:31,110 --> 00:27:34,179
central nervous system so what we do

419
00:27:34,179 --> 00:27:38,320
users Lee on a chemical called karma
dobre

420
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:42,899
which blocks the metabolism on Aldo but
you don't mean

421
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:47,190
and Kerber dobre does not going into the
central nervous system

422
00:27:47,190 --> 00:27:51,280
so so block the metabolism essentially
prevents

423
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:54,480
the dopamine from being created

424
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:57,780
in the peripheral nervous system

425
00:27:57,780 --> 00:28:00,830
and respect that you just the central
nervous system

426
00:28:00,830 --> 00:28:04,939
Leduc greatly helps with all the side
effects

427
00:28:04,940 --> 00:28:11,940
that our on the outside sorry or use the
combination

428
00:28:12,300 --> 00:28:15,660
serotonin her

429
00:28:15,660 --> 00:28:18,970
third ordinary it's it's an old
neurotransmitter I

430
00:28:18,970 --> 00:28:22,830
being a bit like be a as sort of the
JavaScript nobody

431
00:28:22,830 --> 00:28:26,689
nervous system it's everywhere

432
00:28:26,690 --> 00:28:30,170
debate what is it does all kinds of
things om

433
00:28:30,170 --> 00:28:35,420
there's fourteen different receptor
types on a

434
00:28:35,420 --> 00:28:40,020
that we know I love on most of its not
in the central nervous system moves to

435
00:28:40,020 --> 00:28:41,020
the downside of

436
00:28:41,020 --> 00:28:45,410
other stuff but a percent focusing on
the central nervous system

437
00:28:45,410 --> 00:28:49,410
and as on these earlier

438
00:28:49,410 --> 00:28:55,240
pathways mom me I as a backs on mood in
memory and perception

439
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:59,060
beer all kinds of stuff sold everywhere

440
00:28:59,060 --> 00:29:04,070
that's a really complicated a
neurotransmitter

441
00:29:04,070 --> 00:29:07,070
mom mint family structures

442
00:29:07,070 --> 00:29:10,928
with serotonin and some other
similarities

443
00:29:10,929 --> 00:29:14,290
psychoactive substances that on some way
affect

444
00:29:14,290 --> 00:29:17,678
serotonin mom yeah I've some

445
00:29:17,679 --> 00:29:21,370
on you hello san adjourning silence

446
00:29:21,370 --> 00:29:24,620
solos in DMT nasty

447
00:29:24,620 --> 00:29:30,320
sumatriptan is a a a drug is used to
treat migraine headaches

448
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:33,780
com with the LAUSD here's a little
harder does either

449
00:29:33,780 --> 00:29:36,899
structural similarity

450
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:40,880
so I highlighted on the the slide
occurred

451
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:44,600
on the lapd a turned be serotonin
molecule there

452
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:47,880
on the bottom match com

453
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:52,080
Ellis Deen on so many other
hallucinogens are

454
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:58,060
on to a agonists on

455
00:29:58,060 --> 00:30:01,740
although they're still and I'm really
not

456
00:30:01,740 --> 00:30:05,540
fully understood were genetically
there's

457
00:30:05,540 --> 00:30:08,639
really loves doubly her react figured
out

458
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:12,770
about the nervous system like I've
learned a lot but I've ended up having

459
00:30:12,770 --> 00:30:16,260
more questions and I started with

460
00:30:16,260 --> 00:30:20,670
her mazzola I don't mind will serve
about

461
00:30:20,670 --> 00:30:23,820
geometric patterns like people reporter
actually

462
00:30:23,820 --> 00:30:26,850
in migraines and in like

463
00:30:26,850 --> 00:30:32,800
hallucinogens mom the basie certain
types of patterns

464
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:38,560
among other things and basically are are
written on the nerves Mar aetna

465
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:42,120
are mapped onto your are visual cortex

466
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:46,350
om and the Wonder

467
00:30:46,350 --> 00:30:50,660
there's different parts the visual
cortex but we wanna book primary

468
00:30:50,660 --> 00:30:54,460
1 activates mom with her

469
00:30:54,460 --> 00:30:58,480
even you imagine really beloved imagery

470
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:03,570
om people on you have migraines
sometimes get

471
00:31:03,570 --> 00:31:06,800
vigil or other involves mom

472
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:11,980
9 lines and geometric things going
across their visual

473
00:31:11,980 --> 00:31:15,300
field mom and

474
00:31:15,300 --> 00:31:18,930
that has been determined that migraine
her

475
00:31:18,930 --> 00:31:21,930
the precursor to migraine aura

476
00:31:21,930 --> 00:31:27,070
involves on what's called a portable
spreading depression rigidly

477
00:31:27,070 --> 00:31:30,439
electro I'm

478
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:34,230
electrophysiological band is a

479
00:31:34,230 --> 00:31:37,930
nur hyperactivity volatile I suppression

480
00:31:37,930 --> 00:31:41,430
and sometimes it will go across the
visual cortex and

481
00:31:41,430 --> 00:31:47,120
sometimes not and money goes across the
visual cortex that you see all those

482
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:52,690
patterns mom so drugs that cause wiring
in the visual cortex

483
00:31:52,690 --> 00:31:56,270
but also produce those kinds of patterns
mom

484
00:31:56,270 --> 00:32:01,230
has I'm unproven her but there's a a
paper in 2002

485
00:32:01,230 --> 00:32:05,690
mom that a that had a a rather elaborate

486
00:32:05,690 --> 00:32:08,800
other computer models on /url compete

487
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:13,330
computation magazines though our flowers
kinda interesting

488
00:32:13,330 --> 00:32:17,320
mom May showed they talked about some
other different

489
00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:21,290
kinds like spirals in things and tunnels

490
00:32:21,290 --> 00:32:25,690
and and how the visual cortex like the
mapping

491
00:32:25,690 --> 00:32:28,790
is not like basically

492
00:32:28,790 --> 00:32:32,920
mom the the area where you're focused on

493
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:37,130
has a lot takes up a lot more space on
the visual cortex nine-year

494
00:32:37,130 --> 00:32:40,830
peripheral vision there's more
information here

495
00:32:40,830 --> 00:32:45,270
on soul that can cause ur leader
mathematically

496
00:32:45,270 --> 00:32:48,780
and showed that could Gaza distortions
all that you would see

497
00:32:48,780 --> 00:32:54,280
you know a tunnel on baby had certain
patterns are firing year

498
00:32:54,280 --> 00:32:58,410
neurons home the mathematics were beyond

499
00:32:58,410 --> 00:33:01,700
my knee abilities I stopped helps you

500
00:33:01,700 --> 00:33:04,740
mom so

501
00:33:04,740 --> 00:33:08,130
this was just an example an equation
here

502
00:33:08,130 --> 00:33:15,130
the Bonham on so I'll know and a
possible mechanism

503
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:18,650
so in conclusion mom

504
00:33:18,650 --> 00:33:21,960
I actually finished LL faster than me

505
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:25,550
I would but they'll just be more time
for questions

506
00:33:25,550 --> 00:33:30,669
mom bring them as they can leave us with
more questions than answers

507
00:33:30,670 --> 00:33:34,740
marijuana saber than the legal we'd

508
00:33:34,740 --> 00:33:41,600
giant foam dominoes or less messy than
as a base extractions

509
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:47,390
and DEA compliant scratch remover is
available online

510
00:33:47,390 --> 00:33:51,010
from so I am

511
00:33:51,010 --> 00:33:54,379
are just some additional resources for
you guys

512
00:33:54,380 --> 00:33:57,400
on way recommend Underwood

513
00:33:57,400 --> 00:34:01,740
decor has a lot of information about
psychoactive substances

514
00:34:01,740 --> 00:34:05,350
Medscape for more medical

515
00:34:05,350 --> 00:34:09,700
oriented stuff with PPD is pretty
accurate usually

516
00:34:09,700 --> 00:34:13,399
mom I mean I've gone on there in added
some articles and

517
00:34:13,399 --> 00:34:17,120
verified ya gonna double check the
source is but

518
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:22,168
is actually pretty good an interview on
email me

519
00:34:22,168 --> 00:34:25,350
with questions or corrections

520
00:34:25,350 --> 00:34:29,100
Pay Pal donations job offers

521
00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:35,219
the goal line hmm I need doing
bibliographies

522
00:34:35,220 --> 00:34:38,480
I didn't do on but if you want my
references

523
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:42,690
perles her presentation I have them

524
00:34:42,690 --> 00:34:46,470
and someone really wants the again

525
00:34:46,470 --> 00:34:51,240
I can now format that give you my
citations

526
00:34:51,240 --> 00:34:58,240
so that's about it questions

527
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:21,230
a loner yeah I have a question on I love
you

528
00:35:21,230 --> 00:35:28,230
yeah do we have

529
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:35,869
any mechanism for objectively for doctor

530
00:35:35,869 --> 00:35:39,040
detecting when the patient is
experiencing pain

531
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:42,050
so far as I know it's mostly subjective

532
00:35:42,050 --> 00:35:45,810
I go to the doctor I say have a headache
the doctor doesn't know

533
00:35:45,810 --> 00:35:49,230
how much a headache what kind of
headache anything it's just what I tell

534
00:35:49,230 --> 00:35:49,839
the doctor

535
00:35:49,839 --> 00:35:54,759
year that is pretty much the state of
pain management right now

536
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:58,490
mom is very desirable and discussed

537
00:35:58,490 --> 00:36:01,570
in research to find a way to

538
00:36:01,570 --> 00:36:04,700
Tucson now measure you know someone's
pain

539
00:36:04,700 --> 00:36:08,270
on but right now it's all like bill

540
00:36:08,270 --> 00:36:11,570
as you how much pain on a scale of one
to 10

541
00:36:11,570 --> 00:36:14,660
basically based you know

542
00:36:14,660 --> 00:36:19,399
what you say everyone sir experience the
pain is different and her tolerance is

543
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:20,290
different so

544
00:36:20,290 --> 00:36:24,750
we're early it's frustrating brothers
limitation right now

545
00:36:24,750 --> 00:36:28,820
year

546
00:36:28,820 --> 00:36:32,400
yeah well known for being a pain hmm

547
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:35,650
I just heard within our Jess's have
others they would hire you

548
00:36:35,650 --> 00:36:39,190
and I in in our culture there's a drug
called Prasad him

549
00:36:39,190 --> 00:36:42,550
mines the smart drugs when the first
drugs that the

550
00:36:42,550 --> 00:36:45,619
family for their rest dams as morning

551
00:36:45,619 --> 00:36:49,160
heard the strong and give any pain on my
head that way help the depression

552
00:36:49,160 --> 00:36:53,000
I've heard that one mom

553
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:58,060
I would have to look it up because I
don't remember all the details

554
00:36:58,060 --> 00:37:01,720
on beginning email me mom

555
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:05,260
yeah than Allah and I'll see you again
mind about it

556
00:37:05,260 --> 00:37:08,770
I thanks for a great time

557
00:37:08,770 --> 00:37:13,170
is there any information on the
naturopathic stuff and does it have

558
00:37:13,170 --> 00:37:14,800
similar actions like you know for

559
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:19,060
depression or pay me leering routine
Jones where is it similar neurogenesis

560
00:37:19,060 --> 00:37:23,589
you know there is some information I
mean a longer the star

561
00:37:23,589 --> 00:37:27,810
on a their isn't much information about

562
00:37:27,810 --> 00:37:32,140
oMG is it hasn't been studied in and
like a mother Herbals

563
00:37:32,140 --> 00:37:35,339
will be some new combination they come
out with us

564
00:37:35,339 --> 00:37:39,140
really kinda random Saint John's war
does have evidence

565
00:37:39,140 --> 00:37:43,000
mom it affects all free you know

566
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:47,480
monoamines I mention or panetta burn
serotonin and dopamine

567
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:50,650
on and also interact with billion

568
00:37:50,650 --> 00:37:53,690
prescription medications so

569
00:37:53,690 --> 00:37:57,450
maybe ever take it make sure you tell
your doctor about that

570
00:37:57,450 --> 00:38:00,790
com and yes does

571
00:38:00,790 --> 00:38:05,130
also burden would be neurogenesis
malaria in

572
00:38:05,130 --> 00:38:08,810
mom I am NOT as Miley here with the
evidence on that

573
00:38:08,810 --> 00:38:12,619
on it's one of them were studied once
mom

574
00:38:12,619 --> 00:38:15,750
me on team seems to have some affect on

575
00:38:15,750 --> 00:38:20,570
anxiety and sleep adapt a little more
detail about their

576
00:38:20,570 --> 00:38:23,710
I was wondering about the

577
00:38:23,710 --> 00:38:27,170
substances like valium for example army
explained how depressed

578
00:38:27,170 --> 00:38:30,930
the action potentials and everything
know you would assume that an

579
00:38:30,930 --> 00:38:35,049
over does would eventually leads to well
collapse of the actions and our

580
00:38:35,050 --> 00:38:38,780
so first of all our why doesn't over
does not kill you and our second

581
00:38:38,780 --> 00:38:39,720
question would be

582
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:43,510
why do combinations of the substances
like for example

583
00:38:43,510 --> 00:38:47,810
valium combined with the surgeon malaria
drug be have become

584
00:38:47,810 --> 00:38:51,619
totally fatal all of a sudden in

585
00:38:51,619 --> 00:38:55,540
the year the benzo days the PM's
basically be

586
00:38:55,540 --> 00:39:00,150
nom inhibit but they have a sealing a
pact

587
00:39:00,150 --> 00:39:03,869
on so all violence sells an overdose

588
00:39:03,869 --> 00:39:09,420
I get a certain point they cannot you
know let more chloride into the cell

589
00:39:09,420 --> 00:39:14,300
om but if you combine them with some
others order to present

590
00:39:14,300 --> 00:39:17,540
mom you know that has a doc miller
mechanism

591
00:39:17,540 --> 00:39:21,119
more action on gamma then neck could
kill you because

592
00:39:21,119 --> 00:39:24,700
on learn now than at that point yet

593
00:39:24,700 --> 00:39:27,930
could slow your breathing down and now
you die

594
00:39:27,930 --> 00:39:32,419
who's winning and who's been like any

595
00:39:32,420 --> 00:39:36,300
X-ers work on trying to stimulate the
brain using to Sir

596
00:39:36,300 --> 00:39:39,640
electrical impulses directly rather than
using drugs to target

597
00:39:39,640 --> 00:39:44,000
causes the nurse up this is the hardest
tapping their instructors admit that how

598
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,339
reliable that is when that would be
mainstream

599
00:39:46,339 --> 00:39:49,420
are there are 11

600
00:39:49,420 --> 00:39:54,609
arm factual electroconvulsive therapy

601
00:39:54,609 --> 00:39:57,819
miss tilly's sometimes very severe
depression

602
00:39:57,819 --> 00:40:02,080
and that involves mom you know basically
shocking the brain cells

603
00:40:02,080 --> 00:40:06,210
it's done with on anesthetic I believe
because

604
00:40:06,210 --> 00:40:10,720
basically they cause a controlled
seizure control gon Paulson

605
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:14,190
mom and and

606
00:40:14,190 --> 00:40:18,050
net seems to it seems to be very
effective for

607
00:40:18,050 --> 00:40:22,490
those really deep tart depressions their
hard for people to get outta

608
00:40:22,490 --> 00:40:26,670
but it's also has some side effects on
memory and things

609
00:40:26,670 --> 00:40:29,800
mom adviser its you know

610
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:33,010
not is easy yours you know

611
00:40:33,010 --> 00:40:36,359
and expenses taking medications but it
is

612
00:40:36,359 --> 00:40:39,970
out there and it is another and it is an
effective

613
00:40:39,970 --> 00:40:43,369
and home now official

614
00:40:43,369 --> 00:40:46,450
you know treatment option

615
00:40:46,450 --> 00:40:50,540
ahead I just workers in disunity about
how like motion sickness drugs like from

616
00:40:50,540 --> 00:40:53,339
a meaner similar things work

617
00:40:53,339 --> 00:40:57,349
on Yahoo all that hmm

618
00:40:57,349 --> 00:41:01,450
very dry remember exactly

619
00:41:01,450 --> 00:41:05,300
year die from Hyder me meclizine

620
00:41:05,300 --> 00:41:09,670
mom they have both any histamine an
anticholinergic gopac's

621
00:41:09,670 --> 00:41:13,359
in the central nervous system mom

622
00:41:13,359 --> 00:41:16,598
I'm not sure exactly their back on

623
00:41:16,599 --> 00:41:20,380
I do we have a eighty-mile receptor zone
in our brains

624
00:41:20,380 --> 00:41:24,410
that a that one in stimulated

625
00:41:24,410 --> 00:41:28,420
which opiates for example to stimulate
that it makes you

626
00:41:28,420 --> 00:41:31,869
nauseous mom prolly protect you from

627
00:41:31,869 --> 00:41:35,710
getting poisoned viewer when we evolved

628
00:41:35,710 --> 00:41:41,339
me something random and you know I had
that effect in my car dealership you

629
00:41:41,339 --> 00:41:44,819
mom bada I i'm not recalling

630
00:41:44,819 --> 00:41:48,310
exactly be the mom

631
00:41:48,310 --> 00:41:54,950
meow mechanism I no I mean I know the
anticholinergic an antihistamine

632
00:41:54,950 --> 00:41:59,240
thank you

633
00:41:59,240 --> 00:42:03,420
hi and thanks for a great dog again can
you talk about but

634
00:42:03,420 --> 00:42:06,640
can you talk about wise stimulants

635
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:11,049
make you focus incident more
scatterbrained from

636
00:42:11,050 --> 00:42:14,950
an certain sting

637
00:42:14,950 --> 00:42:19,230
William something like you know I am but
I mean souls adderal

638
00:42:19,230 --> 00:42:22,790
war you know ritalin and and

639
00:42:22,790 --> 00:42:28,470
arraigned in general I think gonna be
released norba never and don't mean

640
00:42:28,470 --> 00:42:33,970
an activator your sympathetic nervous
system so you got some mental

641
00:42:33,970 --> 00:42:37,869
back from some peripheral backs and its
activating

642
00:42:37,869 --> 00:42:41,710
and the purposeful and is usually is the
fighter

643
00:42:41,710 --> 00:42:44,890
light order a response om

644
00:42:44,890 --> 00:42:48,720
so so it helps to you you know focus and
get

645
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:52,450
rammed up in the cases ADHD

646
00:42:52,450 --> 00:42:56,290
in particular it seems that on

647
00:42:56,290 --> 00:42:59,560
that me good there might be

648
00:42:59,560 --> 00:43:02,589
eighty mom you know Lacko

649
00:43:02,589 --> 00:43:06,210
there's something going on glenwood nor
pan-african

650
00:43:06,210 --> 00:43:11,619
in the brain and dopamine and that this
and extra stimulation seems to help

651
00:43:11,619 --> 00:43:15,080
mom I'm not honor lot neurologist

652
00:43:15,080 --> 00:43:18,369
as well on so it is lol

653
00:43:18,369 --> 00:43:22,000
like I i wonder about the start to and
and Mike

654
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:26,109
every year gonna every question I have
mine miss the day I find out why go:

655
00:43:26,109 --> 00:43:30,460
the release nor pan-african the night
okay what's that do

656
00:43:30,460 --> 00:43:34,530
and once this do and I end up with more
questions than

657
00:43:34,530 --> 00:43:38,020
then I started with money that's what I
know about him

658
00:43:38,020 --> 00:43:41,200
I in certain to tag on just a little bit
you can

659
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:46,109
totally use me in sadness but

660
00:43:46,109 --> 00:43:52,119
if you if you do you any kind of like
brain training

661
00:43:52,119 --> 00:43:56,430
is is there a noticeable change in the
chemical

662
00:43:56,430 --> 00:44:01,790
facts your you day-to-day

663
00:44:01,790 --> 00:44:05,190
your elected I'm well I don't know I'm

664
00:44:05,190 --> 00:44:09,280
I don't know or research that would have
to do with that but

665
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:14,230
it my personal opinion based on what I
know about biochemistry

666
00:44:14,230 --> 00:44:18,069
mom its that's plausible to me think
that

667
00:44:18,069 --> 00:44:21,180
their would probably be methods a brain
training men are more

668
00:44:21,180 --> 00:44:27,040
effective than others on in the case a a
DHT specifically it doesn't seem that

669
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:30,400
there's ever know after to

670
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:33,730
you know fully help someone who's really
struggling

671
00:44:33,730 --> 00:44:38,170
but for com but it could be good to have
some other ex

672
00:44:38,170 --> 00:44:42,710
I think thanks

673
00:44:42,710 --> 00:44:45,770
thanks for great talk pumping

674
00:44:45,770 --> 00:44:49,130
understand we build up tolerance is to
use certain drugs

675
00:44:49,130 --> 00:44:53,799
arm as one is there any jobs or
complementary drugs that will

676
00:44:53,799 --> 00:44:57,069
reset those tolerances maybe
particularly for instance

677
00:44:57,069 --> 00:45:00,400
for example mom

678
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:04,940
I'll the short answer is not that I know
mom

679
00:45:04,940 --> 00:45:08,600
good probably not at the moment mom

680
00:45:08,600 --> 00:45:12,480
it's something I could not get on you
know email me

681
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:15,760
and I could blog just to see mom

682
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:21,420
you know I i don't think there's
anything out there that we know

683
00:45:21,420 --> 00:45:25,339
right now that doesn't mean they don't
exist

684
00:45:25,339 --> 00:45:29,130
possibly but we just don't know many

685
00:45:29,130 --> 00:45:35,370
thanks

686
00:45:35,370 --> 00:45:38,440
mmm NMEA

687
00:45:38,440 --> 00:45:41,750
partial antagonists a there's research
into

688
00:45:41,750 --> 00:45:45,270
preventing tolerance

689
00:45:45,270 --> 00:45:48,550
okay something I might look up later

690
00:45:48,550 --> 00:45:52,610
interesting hi

691
00:45:52,610 --> 00:45:56,860
I'm wondering how anxiety disorders

692
00:45:56,860 --> 00:46:01,100
work in the brain chemically and how
anti-anxiety

693
00:46:01,100 --> 00:46:04,820
methods differ from antidepressant wall

694
00:46:04,820 --> 00:46:09,550
differ from other types of meds on

695
00:46:09,550 --> 00:46:13,930
wheeler lover crossover anxiety and
depression

696
00:46:13,930 --> 00:46:18,129
mom and the i mean first-line treatment
with

697
00:46:18,130 --> 00:46:22,310
anxiety disorders is usually a as SRI

698
00:46:22,310 --> 00:46:25,640
serotonin reuptake inhibitor which are

699
00:46:25,640 --> 00:46:31,960
also antidepressant the benzo dies
opinions are also used in anxiety

700
00:46:31,960 --> 00:46:36,850
on a because they have a pretty profound
indirect effect by being

701
00:46:36,850 --> 00:46:41,140
very sedative om but they're not so much

702
00:46:41,140 --> 00:46:46,160
you long-term cuz tolerance can bill to
those

703
00:46:46,160 --> 00:46:49,930
mom and a the SSRI's work better

704
00:46:49,930 --> 00:46:53,040
there's another on drug called

705
00:46:53,040 --> 00:46:56,590
abuse barone which is on

706
00:46:56,590 --> 00:46:59,700
in a class by itself by Gaza doesn't

707
00:46:59,700 --> 00:47:05,090
not many depressant but it does have an
impact on serotonin and seems to work

708
00:47:05,090 --> 00:47:08,090
long-term takes a few weeks to work for

709
00:47:08,090 --> 00:47:11,650
for anxiety cya there

710
00:47:11,650 --> 00:47:14,800
injured by Stan I get some sort of
wondering I'm

711
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:18,040
if we're using the same drugs to treat
them

712
00:47:18,040 --> 00:47:22,330
what chemically is the difference in
similarity between anxiety and

713
00:47:22,330 --> 00:47:23,160
depression

714
00:47:23,160 --> 00:47:26,250
I got a very similar chemical phenomenon

715
00:47:26,250 --> 00:47:29,680
um I think that is is

716
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:34,120
still somewhat of a mystery marine
depression itself like as much as we

717
00:47:34,120 --> 00:47:36,700
have learned about the biochemistry
ovett

718
00:47:36,700 --> 00:47:40,280
the move our basic questions like now I
am

719
00:47:40,280 --> 00:47:45,690
do even you have like why do we have a
large number people who have

720
00:47:45,690 --> 00:47:49,360
you know gotten clinically depressed and

721
00:47:49,360 --> 00:47:53,400
com you know when anxiety and stuff
seems to be so

722
00:47:53,400 --> 00:47:58,860
unhelpful mom you know we're having an
anxiety disorder

723
00:47:58,860 --> 00:48:03,060
on the now

724
00:48:03,060 --> 00:48:07,090
think we really know its ads it's
complicated and

725
00:48:07,090 --> 00:48:11,030
and again small things were where mom

726
00:48:11,030 --> 00:48:16,460
where we understand the law and very
little thanks

727
00:48:16,460 --> 00:48:20,050
so this is a

728
00:48:20,050 --> 00:48:23,480
politics question I'm curious about on

729
00:48:23,480 --> 00:48:27,220
how if at all legitimate research can be
done

730
00:48:27,220 --> 00:48:30,680
these days on schedule 1 drugs now

731
00:48:30,680 --> 00:48:34,020
and how that works in the research
community is it a brick wall

732
00:48:34,020 --> 00:48:37,050
is there a way forward for researchers
you legitimate

733
00:48:37,050 --> 00:48:41,040
work on those kinds of things I am
there're

734
00:48:41,040 --> 00:48:46,420
Thursday way forward I don't know a lot
about the politics but

735
00:48:46,420 --> 00:48:51,040
you might want to look up bomb maps
there's an organization called maps

736
00:48:51,040 --> 00:48:55,759
that is you know on forget what it
stands for

737
00:48:55,760 --> 00:48:59,390
something huh 00 schedule on

738
00:48:59,390 --> 00:49:02,680
yahoo.com so winner country

739
00:49:02,680 --> 00:49:06,040
on a the drugs there controlled

740
00:49:06,040 --> 00:49:09,640
was on drugs are controlled substances
and they put them in News

741
00:49:09,640 --> 00:49:14,210
schedule so schedule on is basically
totally illegal

742
00:49:14,210 --> 00:49:18,290
schedule to who is it has early high
potential for

743
00:49:18,290 --> 00:49:21,350
abuse and harm by

744
00:49:21,350 --> 00:49:25,150
is still have are budget legitimate
medical use

745
00:49:25,150 --> 00:49:29,510
soldiers morphine Arvada me knows our
schedule to

746
00:49:29,510 --> 00:49:34,080
because they still have a legitimate
accepted medical use

747
00:49:34,080 --> 00:49:39,940
the schedule one would be mom you know
stuff like LSD your marijuana

748
00:49:39,940 --> 00:49:43,570
heroin me up solo

749
00:49:43,570 --> 00:49:48,250
those though barely consider now illegal
drugs Ryan

750
00:49:48,250 --> 00:49:53,220
hmm him so it's typically Allah ecstasy

751
00:49:53,220 --> 00:49:57,100
mom it's difficult to do research

752
00:49:57,100 --> 00:50:00,960
on them that's for sure are some other
research has taken place in our

753
00:50:00,960 --> 00:50:01,800
country's

754
00:50:01,800 --> 00:50:06,240
mom as far as I can tell it's probably
pretty difficult over there too

755
00:50:06,240 --> 00:50:10,610
om I'm not sure exactly how much a brick
wall

756
00:50:10,610 --> 00:50:14,320
mom so that something or you might wanna

757
00:50:14,320 --> 00:50:17,650
my name Maps website mom

758
00:50:17,650 --> 00:50:22,690
and a and a nozzle then he conceived
some other research has been done on

759
00:50:22,690 --> 00:50:25,990
on palestinian MDMA for no

760
00:50:25,990 --> 00:50:32,990
psychiatric things and stuff like that
thank you

761
00:50:33,240 --> 00:50:37,630
for society thank you and my question
has to do with

762
00:50:37,630 --> 00:50:42,450
long-term supplementation I have a
really common drugs like caffeine or

763
00:50:42,450 --> 00:50:43,880
nicotine

764
00:50:43,880 --> 00:50:46,910
people have been taking these drugs for
hundreds of years

765
00:50:46,910 --> 00:50:50,839
dealey and they do it because it

766
00:50:50,840 --> 00:50:54,300
make some more alert or whatever now

767
00:50:54,300 --> 00:50:57,770
people are experimenting with more types
have supplementing your controlling what

768
00:50:57,770 --> 00:51:00,540
they're doing to maximize the benefits
they get from them

769
00:51:00,540 --> 00:51:03,870
from and I was wondering

770
00:51:03,870 --> 00:51:07,770
if by you had a position on something
like that to you

771
00:51:07,770 --> 00:51:10,960
drink of beer do you choose not to
because I've some reasons or

772
00:51:10,960 --> 00:51:14,770
whether some cool things that are coming
out that people are taking for

773
00:51:14,770 --> 00:51:18,300
whatever benefit he had

774
00:51:18,300 --> 00:51:22,400
I'll earning every man hourly on boy did
earn

775
00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:27,220
use it much because it doesn't you know
do much for me and a lot of people who

776
00:51:27,220 --> 00:51:30,890
or have and mild ADHD seems a

777
00:51:30,890 --> 00:51:34,040
benefit a lot from it does a sultry om

778
00:51:34,040 --> 00:51:37,870
other people adjust like coffee drink a
lot of good

779
00:51:37,870 --> 00:51:42,720
mom as far as I know I mean there has
been research done on caffeine

780
00:51:42,720 --> 00:51:47,440
and I haven't seen anything it says its
known particularly dangerous or

781
00:51:47,440 --> 00:51:48,600
beneficial

782
00:51:48,600 --> 00:51:51,600
on Irene no I won't recommend

783
00:51:51,600 --> 00:51:55,360
bring being 20 comes a copy attacking
her anything

784
00:51:55,360 --> 00:51:58,570
like yeah sir

785
00:51:58,570 --> 00:52:03,030
so honored saying again now that I don't
have any

786
00:52:03,030 --> 00:52:06,780
opinion on that mom other
supplementation

787
00:52:06,780 --> 00:52:09,960
ideas like I tend to be skeptical about
the benefits love

788
00:52:09,960 --> 00:52:13,410
