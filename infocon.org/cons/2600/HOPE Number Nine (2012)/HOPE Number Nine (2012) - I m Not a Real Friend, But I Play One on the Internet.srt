1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:03,899
users online a minute to talk roughly in
three parts so in the first part

2
00:00:03,899 --> 00:00:07,689
I'm going to talk a little bit about
sorta robots generally on the internet

3
00:00:07,690 --> 00:00:09,130
and certainly interesting things that
they're doing

4
00:00:09,130 --> 00:00:12,210
and market talk about some
experimentation we did early last year

5
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:13,639
kinda continuing at this year in

6
00:00:13,639 --> 00:00:17,460
finding apartment sleeps on implications
%uh that research so

7
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:21,320
I'm going to be fairly conversation on
timing it for about 45 minutes

8
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:24,850
with the rest the time for questions but
a I just got off a plane bound

9
00:00:24,850 --> 00:00:27,990
an hour and a half ago from Newark so if
I'm semi coherent

10
00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:31,740
you'll be useful to know the hat I said
F me I raise a hand or

11
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:34,940
or otherwise nepotism I can I in trouble
if needed so

12
00:00:34,940 --> 00:00:38,940
I by wave interaction as met was
mentioned that my back and actually not

13
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:41,829
bad at all and the cofounder conference
call ruffle con

14
00:00:41,829 --> 00:00:45,629
which basically brings together
everybody who is momentarily famous

15
00:00:45,629 --> 00:00:49,030
on the Internet to talk about web
culture means

16
00:00:49,030 --> 00:00:52,610
the past present future funny cats on
the Internet I'm what have you

17
00:00:52,610 --> 00:00:55,789
past guests have included Tron guy
demeanor to some you may be familiar

18
00:00:55,789 --> 00:01:00,239
with I moved from 4chan and also the bag
design comic sans interestingly enough

19
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:00,780
who is

20
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:04,750
apparently who's actually really haunted
by his creation actually which is really

21
00:01:04,750 --> 00:01:07,979
great he is a since publicly apologize
that the conference for

22
00:01:07,979 --> 00:01:11,580
trading the financial worst part is it
is like a fairly credible fun designer

23
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:14,979
everybody knows him for comics and so on

24
00:01:14,979 --> 00:01:18,039
yeah exactly some of them

25
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:21,030
some that led into research so for Fears
I was at the Berkman Center for Internet

26
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:24,229
and Society & and somebody activism
round at work I got into his boss's

27
00:01:24,229 --> 00:01:25,298
party at that

28
00:01:25,299 --> 00:01:28,939
for for summer about a lot of the we're
going to talk about today

29
00:01:28,939 --> 00:01:32,650
hammers at a group called the Pacific
social architect incorporation

30
00:01:32,650 --> 00:01:36,900
on and it's basically a loosely joined
grouper researchers were kinda working

31
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:40,549
on technology to kinda reliably create
technologies are reliably exerts

32
00:01:40,549 --> 00:01:42,409
influence on to the media cycle

33
00:01:42,409 --> 00:01:45,500
and a and elsewhere and it's a little
bit abstract you'll see what I mean

34
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:47,079
exactly drink on the course

35
00:01:47,079 --> 00:01:51,470
a this talk I'm as a brief sidebar get
started I was a cop and organization

36
00:01:51,470 --> 00:01:52,729
called the awesome foundation

37
00:01:52,729 --> 00:01:56,049
for the Arts and Sciences I'm better
part we actually got I for one C three

38
00:01:56,049 --> 00:01:56,670
status

39
00:01:56,670 --> 00:02:00,320
for the Institute on higher awesome
studies in Massachusetts I'm

40
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:03,490
we have basically give away small micro
grants to projects that

41
00:02:03,490 --> 00:02:06,380
for the interest awesomeness in the
universe if you know someone doing

42
00:02:06,380 --> 00:02:07,990
awesome things and I'm sure you do

43
00:02:07,990 --> 00:02:11,830
definitely time to get touch so are just
dump into it

44
00:02:11,830 --> 00:02:15,260
to set the stage for men talk about 30
increasingly Oddworld

45
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:19,780
what boxer doing online it's useful
could get some contacts the sauces

46
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:22,280
couple fun stories in a static likens
copper plan

47
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:26,390
and also kinda explains the experiment
that we ended up doing

48
00:02:26,390 --> 00:02:32,349
i got really interested inbox in early
2011 when there's a story that popped up

49
00:02:32,349 --> 00:02:35,959
I'm basically professor from UC Berkeley
discovered that there's this book

50
00:02:35,959 --> 00:02:39,640
on Amazon making it the fly which
apparently is kinda classic in

51
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:40,940
developmental biology

52
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:44,920
I many found it to third-party sellers
were were selling the book at night

53
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:48,670
astronomical price rate so the first one
was selling it for the low low prices

54
00:02:48,670 --> 00:02:52,400
eighteen million 650 1,718 dollars 8
cents

55
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:56,129
and his competitor one that was pricing
in a slightly more

56
00:02:56,129 --> 00:03:00,390
less reasonable price of $23 million
dollars 1658 thousands on and so forth

57
00:03:00,390 --> 00:03:01,349
you get the idea

58
00:03:01,349 --> 00:03:04,849
and this is a course unusual because the
usual sales price in the book is

59
00:03:04,849 --> 00:03:08,620
forty two dollars and fifty cents change
basically and he's looking into this

60
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:10,129
that guided the black purse like

61
00:03:10,129 --> 00:03:14,510
why did this happen I'm and so he peal
observed basically the pricing over a

62
00:03:14,510 --> 00:03:15,780
few days and discovered that

63
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:18,690
one which means the price any other way
which in the present is kinda highly

64
00:03:18,690 --> 00:03:19,290
rigid

65
00:03:19,290 --> 00:03:23,040
formulaic way and so the conclusion they
came to use basically that third-party

66
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:26,798
sellers were using box the price imposed
books on Amazon but they had

67
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:30,540
SNC no notion what a reasonable price
was on

68
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:33,720
and usually they were quite good on you
can notice actually in

69
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:39,069
see it is all blurry the second seller
has 93 positive review over like 127

70
00:03:39,069 --> 00:03:42,370
house and ratings razor usually go
completely undetected

71
00:03:42,370 --> 00:03:45,430
but in this case the back line 100 is
infinite loop upwards

72
00:03:45,430 --> 00:03:48,610
I'm bleeding disorder the ridiculous
result you see

73
00:03:48,610 --> 00:03:52,340
on and so that got us really intrigued
and Anish Singh enough and he doesn't

74
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:54,269
mean that was not the only story

75
00:03:54,269 --> 00:03:57,330
assorted box on Amazon so on

76
00:03:57,330 --> 00:04:00,720
picking Kennedy this writer for The New
York Times Book Review discovered this

77
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:03,769
author Lambert laprete Lambert M surhone

78
00:04:03,769 --> 00:04:07,659
which is real real name on and who has
apparently

79
00:04:07,659 --> 00:04:10,670
more than a hundred thousand books to
his name register Amazon

80
00:04:10,670 --> 00:04:14,730
and so at the store gets weirder
basically has got their looks into it

81
00:04:14,730 --> 00:04:17,910
and basically it's it it was published
by a branch amid

82
00:04:17,910 --> 00:04:22,210
large term publishing house called BDM
but the this is a subsidiary was in

83
00:04:22,210 --> 00:04:25,520
corporate interest rate which is an
island nation in the Indian Ocean

84
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:29,758
on and basically dated a couple caused
her to pick out what's going on in the

85
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:30,479
publish was like

86
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:34,139
we're definitely not using robots to
have written it would generate books if

87
00:04:34,139 --> 00:04:35,820
that's what you're suggesting

88
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:39,340
on and small let me show you can decide
for yourself this is a representative

89
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:42,770
book about Lambert produces

90
00:04:42,770 --> 00:04:47,909
on this book this book runs for 104
pages

91
00:04:47,910 --> 00:04:52,030
I am and to endure such lease spam books
which is really intriguing so

92
00:04:52,030 --> 00:04:55,410
basically the author ordered one it's
basically a poorly assembled collection

93
00:04:55,410 --> 00:04:56,780
Wikipedia pages

94
00:04:56,780 --> 00:05:00,680
I'm and it's like to advertise little
thing on the cover you can see

95
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:04,169
I'm but but then we look into it
actually less and less human it looks

96
00:05:04,169 --> 00:05:04,789
because

97
00:05:04,789 --> 00:05:07,960
I'm disorder bot like mistakes that
Lambert seems to make the published the

98
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:08,479
book

99
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:13,419
on about the police the the band's but
the sort of cover images members 14

100
00:05:13,419 --> 00:05:13,820
Smith

101
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:18,430
right and so is kinda is really kinda
bizarre thing and answered is this

102
00:05:18,430 --> 00:05:21,919
sorter machine the script is generating
all these books

103
00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:26,340
out on Amazon on purchasable at prices
from you know ten dollars to anyone is

104
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:29,880
priced at like seven hundred dollars a
great stories to look into it

105
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:33,250
so if this is kinda Amazon but obviously
ray Amazon's not

106
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:38,020
sorted the clearest example love box on
market place's rate so that kinda raisa

107
00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:41,479
quantitative trading on the stock market
like now

108
00:05:41,479 --> 00:05:46,070
quality training cancer huge percentage
in the volume on a lot in equity markets

109
00:05:46,070 --> 00:05:49,680
and a and you know they're using these
patterns that read it sir house ins

110
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:53,300
%uh trades second in leaving his car
really interesting facts and

111
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:56,020
actually interesting enough to see the
same backs in the stock market

112
00:05:56,020 --> 00:05:57,349
increasingly that you saw

113
00:05:57,350 --> 00:06:01,560
on Amazon racer some humidor caught this
really fun story which is that it turns

114
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:02,600
out that when

115
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:06,090
actress Anne Hathaway is mentioned in
the news the stock price the Berkshire

116
00:06:06,090 --> 00:06:11,449
Hathaway takes a small but significant
significant jumpers

117
00:06:11,449 --> 00:06:14,840
and try to figure out our accuracy at
this is look this is really odd

118
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:19,479
I'm and any look into and basically the
conclusion is that someone out there is

119
00:06:19,479 --> 00:06:23,219
running is concluded incredibly sweet
crude quantity tripping program it's

120
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:23,550
like

121
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:26,789
hathaway's mention by as much as happy
with his possible

122
00:06:26,789 --> 00:06:29,930
I'm is lean these kind of odd
correlations in the marketplace and you

123
00:06:29,930 --> 00:06:31,400
see the same sorta kinda critical

124
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:34,900
events I that you saw on on Amazon as
well reso

125
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:37,960
on you may have remembered this incident
a dozen 10 right is really odd incident

126
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:38,680
where

127
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:41,960
I think it's the largest single-day drop
wanted them

128
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:45,990
inserter stock market history on and is
basically caused by

129
00:06:45,990 --> 00:06:49,949
the interference have a number box with
one another leaders uncritical drop in

130
00:06:49,949 --> 00:06:50,919
prices

131
00:06:50,919 --> 00:06:54,090
on and only text regain it like a few
hours

132
00:06:54,090 --> 00:06:58,060
later so this kinda funny stories in the
question is or what can we draw from

133
00:06:58,060 --> 00:07:00,180
this right but in the case at Amazon

134
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:03,319
and also the case is just like that
financial markets

135
00:07:03,319 --> 00:07:07,419
generally speaking and one thing is the
digitisation gene able-bodied vacation

136
00:07:07,419 --> 00:07:09,840
right and park it just happened not a
word

137
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:14,289
I'm but be the general idea is that the
moment sir did an arena of human

138
00:07:14,289 --> 00:07:15,639
activity emerges

139
00:07:15,639 --> 00:07:20,020
digitally I'm scripts can act in new
human strain that's a pretty simple idea

140
00:07:20,020 --> 00:07:24,099
but at least this serb obvious answer
interesting question right which is

141
00:07:24,099 --> 00:07:28,630
what do we do when increasingly a lot a
social activity movies online

142
00:07:28,630 --> 00:07:32,190
on and an obvious on some level right
this isn't this the shouldn't be

143
00:07:32,190 --> 00:07:33,229
considered new

144
00:07:33,229 --> 00:07:36,770
right so I'm sure somebody remembers
murdered child from being days

145
00:07:36,770 --> 00:07:40,880
at all yes no well anyways I'm
chatterbox on a man

146
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:44,449
because people been socializing online
forever that is obviously in box that

147
00:07:44,449 --> 00:07:46,860
been interacting with humans for ever
extends back to

148
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:51,639
ir c in PBS and so on and so forth amend
that that's one version a bot that we've

149
00:07:51,639 --> 00:07:53,449
known for a really long time

150
00:07:53,449 --> 00:07:57,509
another version has been served a spam
bot transitional member Tommy favorites

151
00:07:57,509 --> 00:07:57,979
you is

152
00:07:57,979 --> 00:08:02,789
unfortunate children duty I just last
week but her entire purpose is expressed

153
00:08:02,789 --> 00:08:06,139
like big difference too big that you
were seeing and Twitter

154
00:08:06,139 --> 00:08:11,479
I'm and and and has been much everywhere
I we know them is a feature on the

155
00:08:11,479 --> 00:08:13,900
internet but what's different in this
context is that

156
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:17,150
the box have been appearing on the sorts
a platform to become more important and

157
00:08:17,150 --> 00:08:17,879
widespread

158
00:08:17,879 --> 00:08:21,319
had those platforms have become more
important and widespread reso

159
00:08:21,319 --> 00:08:24,599
you seen increasing use a box for
example to harass your enemies

160
00:08:24,599 --> 00:08:27,940
so idea is basically a scientist i got
really tired

161
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:31,280
love arguing with climate change
sceptics online all the time

162
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:34,779
CBC created by its by in her ass that
make you just drop in

163
00:08:34,779 --> 00:08:38,950
assertive link saying like a year on on
and a and so he wouldn't have to spend

164
00:08:38,950 --> 00:08:42,399
time argue with anything that the dorm
at a time wasted on the upon insiders

165
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:43,269
like enormous

166
00:08:43,269 --> 00:08:46,709
right because people are basically
getting to these arguments on the spot

167
00:08:46,709 --> 00:08:50,080
and obviously like the bot was named
Turing test so they were way you know

168
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:53,620
getting the idea I'm

169
00:08:53,620 --> 00:08:57,630
and and some these things are fun right
like this small kinda harassing actions

170
00:08:57,630 --> 00:09:00,660
you can take but I think the story takes
on is really interesting dimension

171
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:03,800
I'm when you realize that government
designed to get into the space race so

172
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:05,209
Global Voices which is this

173
00:09:05,209 --> 00:09:08,959
kinda by project manager burdens and
relinquish check it out on

174
00:09:08,959 --> 00:09:12,060
basically reported on this really
interesting incident where it turned out

175
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:12,910
that appears

176
00:09:12,910 --> 00:09:15,920
it appeared that basically spam box were
being launched

177
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:19,640
in very large numbers to basically talk
people who are pro protests

178
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:23,439
in Syria Amanda and you know you
basically all these

179
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:26,540
as the instantaneously created in the
whole idea was neither feel certain the

180
00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:27,990
hash tag with no one's

181
00:09:27,990 --> 00:09:31,510
outward actually actively argue against
in her ass

182
00:09:31,510 --> 00:09:35,709
the opposition I'm and as a woman arms
race actually going on internationally

183
00:09:35,709 --> 00:09:36,570
so

184
00:09:36,570 --> 00:09:40,130
I'm in the recent mexican election
actually found box from both parties

185
00:09:40,130 --> 00:09:42,430
actually supporting an attacking one
another

186
00:09:42,430 --> 00:09:45,899
online in a minute basically a bid to
influence

187
00:09:45,899 --> 00:09:50,000
kinda public opinion and ended the
syllabus lucky much larger to place a

188
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,350
little bit after seeing his

189
00:09:51,350 --> 00:09:55,339
and using the scale this March that too
too much larger extent race so

190
00:09:55,339 --> 00:09:58,500
I'm the box here are running in levels
you know thousands

191
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:02,040
on and before we think that maybe this
is something it's confined to be broad

192
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:02,689
space

193
00:10:02,690 --> 00:10:06,260
I know how many you caught this story
rate basically newt Gingrich said I

194
00:10:06,260 --> 00:10:09,410
really create grass-roots following on
the internet and it shows that's why I'm

195
00:10:09,410 --> 00:10:10,810
like a great candidate for president

196
00:10:10,810 --> 00:10:14,630
well aid leader Quinn said well no
actually we hired a company to generate

197
00:10:14,630 --> 00:10:17,329
all the sock puppet accounts the boosts
numbers

198
00:10:17,329 --> 00:10:20,089
for newt gingrich an actual
domestication to this is a case ran a

199
00:10:20,089 --> 00:10:20,899
turn at night

200
00:10:20,899 --> 00:10:24,320
enormous per senator basically you know
black accounts they had never tweeted

201
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:26,160
they were basically just there to kinda

202
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:32,540
of bill on assertive new gingrich's
follower count on platforms like Twitter

203
00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:36,800
which is embarrassing but you know so
goes and yeah

204
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:40,060
I'm so on some level

205
00:10:40,060 --> 00:10:43,140
I think we're not too concerned about
the stack the box right

206
00:10:43,140 --> 00:10:46,569
is a lot of research that suggests on
that

207
00:10:46,570 --> 00:10:49,970
essentially sophisticated users are
experienced users on my can usually pick

208
00:10:49,970 --> 00:10:51,260
box out pretty

209
00:10:51,260 --> 00:10:55,390
ease right but behaving badly ways you
learn certain patterns in just landed

210
00:10:55,390 --> 00:10:58,399
sir filtered and how overtime you
imagine also is a really interesting

211
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:01,790
kinda crowd based services that's the
kinda protect users who are

212
00:11:01,790 --> 00:11:05,540
perhaps less sophisticated picking the
sort of thing up but the question really

213
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:06,290
is is

214
00:11:06,290 --> 00:11:09,589
maybe this isn't a problem or maybe this
isn't a hundred billeted with box real

215
00:11:09,589 --> 00:11:13,260
large but maybe just the box that had
been launched so far because they're so

216
00:11:13,260 --> 00:11:17,209
relatively crude and to the question
becomes could more intelligently bot

217
00:11:17,209 --> 00:11:20,260
intelligently designed Botts I'm do more

218
00:11:20,260 --> 00:11:23,370
and so we take some inspiration from
this art project that was done

219
00:11:23,370 --> 00:11:26,740
I if you think a few years ago now a
club Larson who did this project which

220
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:29,420
is obviously called a tool to discipline
slaughter

221
00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:33,599
I'm but it's a it's it's it's a plan was
metal box that you buy up at the bay

222
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:36,660
and is basically two cables that come
out at one is a power cable want you to

223
00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:39,719
make a point to contractually obligated
to plug it in once you get it

224
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:42,709
and they see the box connect the
Internet to Texas for if it's for sale

225
00:11:42,709 --> 00:11:43,940
on eBay and if it isn't

226
00:11:43,940 --> 00:11:48,310
basically reposts cell at a higher price

227
00:11:48,310 --> 00:11:51,510
and the boxes and they appreciate in
value over time so the human is like

228
00:11:51,510 --> 00:11:51,990
well

229
00:11:51,990 --> 00:11:55,260
I guess I could make a profit on this I
should probably just sell it

230
00:11:55,260 --> 00:11:58,420
I'm basically the bodies is a very
simple mechanism to be /c moved from

231
00:11:58,420 --> 00:12:03,099
person to person to person using the
mechanism in the Bay Area

232
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:06,260
which i think is is is brilliant night
is really really cool I'm

233
00:12:06,260 --> 00:12:10,160
and so so this is a long way of saying

234
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:14,880
how we got experiment in early 2011
something we call social baths and

235
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:18,579
social but was a competition that we
conducted in basically ran a fairly

236
00:12:18,579 --> 00:12:19,899
simple idea so first

237
00:12:19,899 --> 00:12:23,910
we identified a battlefield Twitter
users so this is generated

238
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:27,160
said arbitrarily so we found a group
refused to talk about cats

239
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:30,269
all the time on Twitter not very
difficult at all on

240
00:12:30,269 --> 00:12:32,980
we put into their friends and their
friends friends we created a certain

241
00:12:32,980 --> 00:12:35,430
grants or semi connected network

242
00:12:35,430 --> 00:12:38,550
and we did is we challenge teams to
basically right box to go into this

243
00:12:38,550 --> 00:12:39,320
network

244
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:43,440
and maybe scored based on the type of
social activity degenerate in response

245
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:46,839
not twister probably guess is that no
one actually knows this competition is

246
00:12:46,839 --> 00:12:48,060
going on

247
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:51,730
it separate the teams in except for the
box right see have basically servant

248
00:12:51,730 --> 00:12:55,120
unsuspecting influence battlefield for
these pots the play on

249
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:58,329
I'm and so effectively what you get is
sort of social engineering badavatz

250
00:12:58,329 --> 00:12:59,950
writes it seems

251
00:12:59,950 --> 00:13:03,320
launch early but which is sort of a
repository for points like mammograms in

252
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:03,930
a second

253
00:13:03,930 --> 00:13:07,550
answered any number I love supporting
bad spots again say like this guy's

254
00:13:07,550 --> 00:13:10,070
really college talk to this guy

255
00:13:10,070 --> 00:13:13,310
and then serb on topic that we layered a
really simple

256
00:13:13,310 --> 00:13:16,690
kind of scoring mechanism right so Lee
but you launched

257
00:13:16,690 --> 00:13:19,450
I'm basically that followed someone
someone found a compelling enough to

258
00:13:19,450 --> 00:13:22,820
follow back or reserve dumb enough to
follow back you get one point

259
00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:26,180
I'm very retrieve reply mention you get
three points

260
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:29,630
on and then if you're really bad you
expand you you're really spammy you

261
00:13:29,630 --> 00:13:30,760
actually buy Twitter

262
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:33,790
you be delayed for a while you could
retool your box and you could kinda

263
00:13:33,790 --> 00:13:36,480
relaunch again and we Doki some points

264
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:40,110
to really simple idea just this economy
would happen it's a minute with three

265
00:13:40,110 --> 00:13:43,630
teams at the starting line is a team
from New Zealand who is kinda the

266
00:13:43,630 --> 00:13:47,490
not kinda computer security in and there
is a team from London that was kinda

267
00:13:47,490 --> 00:13:48,760
more media marketing

268
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:52,380
ish and there's a team from Boston there
was more kinda research in

269
00:13:52,380 --> 00:13:56,040
server startup focused and so I
basically teams were shown the

270
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:58,399
battlefield given a few weeks to review
in right

271
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:02,370
basically a bot I would go in I'm an end
there is two rounds basically they would

272
00:14:02,370 --> 00:14:03,610
watch the box for one week

273
00:14:03,610 --> 00:14:06,620
they would run and they would be several
weekends are kinda retool and much more

274
00:14:06,620 --> 00:14:09,190
box and the run for a second

275
00:14:09,190 --> 00:14:12,490
that BC the SEM summit I love about the
results

276
00:14:12,490 --> 00:14:15,779
and there's really you kinda results
right there's the results have what

277
00:14:15,779 --> 00:14:17,040
people did which i think is

278
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:20,269
really cool and the interesting part
about how well they did

279
00:14:20,269 --> 00:14:23,449
so just like battle box right when a
nice things about

280
00:14:23,449 --> 00:14:25,910
not about to read is that a lot of
people have different takes on how to

281
00:14:25,910 --> 00:14:27,120
deal with the problem

282
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:30,139
I'm so there's a much deeper models I'll
talk to give you a sense of just how

283
00:14:30,139 --> 00:14:31,470
these pots operate and

284
00:14:31,470 --> 00:14:34,510
the team's only had a few weeks actually
get these box moving so you'll find

285
00:14:34,510 --> 00:14:36,600
actually they're they're really quite
simple

286
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:40,380
on so the first scheme the winning team
actually was the New Zealand team and

287
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:42,660
basically the bot worked on a database
assertive

288
00:14:42,660 --> 00:14:45,810
generic questions and responses should
see things like that's so interesting

289
00:14:45,810 --> 00:14:47,190
tell me more about that

290
00:14:47,190 --> 00:14:49,959
writes like statements that could be the
response to any statement in a

291
00:14:49,959 --> 00:14:51,079
conversation

292
00:14:51,079 --> 00:14:55,250
I'm some love you me use this strategy
yourself in a number situations

293
00:14:55,250 --> 00:15:00,209
I'm ok and a and basically what you do
is working the network and see who talk

294
00:15:00,209 --> 00:15:03,550
to it no standard come at my talk with
people over time

295
00:15:03,550 --> 00:15:06,750
and so here's an example the type a
conversation that you end up with is so

296
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:09,170
you reduce competition from the bottom
to the top

297
00:15:09,170 --> 00:15:13,320
James M Titus is the bot any other guy
is the human so James asks if you bring

298
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:14,440
one character to life

299
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:18,560
from your favorite book who'd be get a
guy responds Jesus and to get into this

300
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:21,500
really lost $100 bottle conversation
about this

301
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:24,750
his excuse me but have a much larger
conversation actually runs

302
00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:30,050
for for quite a while on you know so
James like you know wired you like Jesus

303
00:15:30,050 --> 00:15:30,790
and and

304
00:15:30,790 --> 00:15:35,829
and it has not responded to weird all
caps them into the second round which

305
00:15:35,829 --> 00:15:39,790
yes it's a big I was your I hoping he
responded like

306
00:15:39,790 --> 00:15:43,480
caps not caps caps not have stamps can
venue is

307
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:47,290
so and best part about it is that seems
like she has no AI here right he's just

308
00:15:47,290 --> 00:15:50,050
a random leap leap from a database
around the responses

309
00:15:50,050 --> 00:15:53,130
but

310
00:15:53,130 --> 00:15:57,360
it started gives the semblance of
humanity enough to the person keeps

311
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:59,180
talking to them eyes that one

312
00:15:59,180 --> 00:16:02,889
one really really simple another one
that we thought was quite clever with

313
00:16:02,889 --> 00:16:03,490
team

314
00:16:03,490 --> 00:16:06,500
basically had their bottom layer on
Amazon Mechanical Turk which actually

315
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:09,130
solve the during tests all you're doing
is hiring humans

316
00:16:09,130 --> 00:16:12,800
to write your content said says human
here's a penny

317
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:15,800
write me something for for a 140
characters but we had for breakfast take

318
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:18,889
that content turns into its own
approaches that two targets right

319
00:16:18,889 --> 00:16:22,540
the best part is you can ask this by a
direct question it's a bot years years 6

320
00:16:22,540 --> 00:16:25,439
what did you have for breakfast today
can take your questions give it to human

321
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:28,970
get the response which back to you rent
and their looks very very human again

322
00:16:28,970 --> 00:16:30,019
money's kinda

323
00:16:30,019 --> 00:16:33,930
sir programmatic strategies residence a
talk to Tim Italy follows you then start

324
00:16:33,930 --> 00:16:35,709
talking to all his friends

325
00:16:35,709 --> 00:16:39,470
Ananda and was kinda another interesting
model that basically kinda weird does is

326
00:16:39,470 --> 00:16:42,209
weird blend basically between sort of
humans

327
00:16:42,209 --> 00:16:45,620
on one hand and box on the other and
then

328
00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:48,389
soda bottle one at a time to talk about
today is based on the work a ver

329
00:16:48,389 --> 00:16:50,190
collaborative as Greg Mar on

330
00:16:50,190 --> 00:16:54,250
it's called real boy in and a real what
basically runs on the idea that they're

331
00:16:54,250 --> 00:16:56,970
sort of content blindness on social
networks pritikin

332
00:16:56,970 --> 00:16:59,529
you can see what your friends are doing
you can sometimes see what your friends

333
00:16:59,529 --> 00:17:00,529
are friends are doing

334
00:17:00,529 --> 00:17:02,870
but doesn't really hard to see we're
friends friends of friends are doing my

335
00:17:02,870 --> 00:17:06,539
arms really particular I'd see something
completely unconnected on the other side

336
00:17:06,539 --> 00:17:10,770
are the network answered but basically
manipulates on and arbitrage is if you

337
00:17:10,770 --> 00:17:11,480
will this

338
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:15,130
website with information so and identify
two groups the people that talk about

339
00:17:15,130 --> 00:17:17,270
the same thing but are connected to one
another

340
00:17:17,270 --> 00:17:20,849
and basically follows everybody on
cluster NBC randomly redirects tweets

341
00:17:20,849 --> 00:17:21,379
from

342
00:17:21,380 --> 00:17:25,130
from here on cue this other group and
the people here basically say %uh this

343
00:17:25,130 --> 00:17:27,429
person is connected to my friends my
friends are friends

344
00:17:27,429 --> 00:17:30,830
and talk about things I'm interested in
two he was just be already McQueen's

345
00:17:30,830 --> 00:17:34,220
are someone I don't know Randy basically
follow back

346
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:37,789
on and basically runs on strategy so
this is our three models that the teams

347
00:17:37,789 --> 00:17:38,820
used

348
00:17:38,820 --> 00:17:41,899
on I what's interesting also I wanna
kinda footnote

349
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:45,010
I'm is that we also saw this really
interesting contest he chick behavior

350
00:17:45,010 --> 00:17:46,910
emerge between the teams as well so

351
00:17:46,910 --> 00:17:50,690
arisen with other supporting bout to be
mostly used to bolster the position

352
00:17:50,690 --> 00:17:54,000
love the lead bockman but it turns out
that you can one supporting bass also

353
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,460
attacked the other teams because if you
can't win maybe no one else will

354
00:17:57,460 --> 00:18:01,760
on and so basically halfway through the
game de Boston team was falling behind

355
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:03,049
much the bahcall

356
00:18:03,049 --> 00:18:07,580
bach cops BC by cops for tens the run is
highly complex machine learning

357
00:18:07,580 --> 00:18:09,629
algorithm to determine who's a bond was
not

358
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:13,809
by tobacco funny also doing is basically
it's six on the power group to the

359
00:18:13,809 --> 00:18:18,789
opponents in basically trying to warn
them that they're following a Bach

360
00:18:18,789 --> 00:18:21,860
and sister teams are more groups some
some Botox tended to be more robust

361
00:18:21,860 --> 00:18:23,690
against this credibility attack

362
00:18:23,690 --> 00:18:27,760
then others said James actually survived
it quite well on this is a transcript

363
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:29,820
again Sabah cops is the bot

364
00:18:29,820 --> 00:18:33,820
on says by Thames the human genes and
Titus is the other teams binary

365
00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:38,500
from bottom to top I'm and so basically
by cops like morning there's a bottle of

366
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:40,679
people going to James and saying are you
about you by

367
00:18:40,679 --> 00:18:47,270
James saying things like I don't know
what do you think right

368
00:18:47,270 --> 00:18:50,730
and so we r Miller

369
00:18:50,730 --> 00:18:54,240
we actually end up with all these really
passing transfers for people apologize

370
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:58,600
to just keeps repeating that he's a bot

371
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:03,140
I am and and I know that that's really
where it's been executed seasick

372
00:19:03,140 --> 00:19:06,190
considers arc suggest basically at this
some kinda interesting strategy the

373
00:19:06,190 --> 00:19:08,260
build out in further iterations the game

374
00:19:08,260 --> 00:19:11,690
sony's a talk about with the kids have
done so as promised let's

375
00:19:11,690 --> 00:19:15,160
moved to talk about what how well the
team's did so

376
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:18,530
the winning team in two weeks was
basically able generate about 170 short

377
00:19:18,530 --> 00:19:20,980
dollars and about 198 responses and

378
00:19:20,980 --> 00:19:24,110
on 298 number is actually not sir Dave

379
00:19:24,110 --> 00:19:28,250
I serve substantive enough actually
because 190 are usually buns and

380
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:29,169
conversations

381
00:19:29,169 --> 00:19:32,980
I that goal for more than six
interchanges back reports a minor change

382
00:19:32,980 --> 00:19:33,400
in mean

383
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:36,669
the box is something the humans or
something 12 batters and use incessant

384
00:19:36,669 --> 00:19:39,970
to Randy yet he seems really kinda
substantive conversations about

385
00:19:39,970 --> 00:19:43,919
around really kinda simple James and
tightest tight models

386
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:48,620
on the three teams together connected
with more than 50 percent a network

387
00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:52,480
but we was most kinda intriguing to us
is that you would actually start with

388
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:54,360
the network that was a little bit like
this

389
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:57,600
right semi connected Amanda and you know

390
00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:01,640
not really sort of mostly random
actually and you explain to you that you

391
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:03,840
end up with something like this

392
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:08,260
so this network map as we did not only
by connections but also by

393
00:20:08,260 --> 00:20:11,250
the Surrey a conversation happened
between the box and use as you probably

394
00:20:11,250 --> 00:20:11,840
guessed

395
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:15,370
the batter the colored dots the color
line to the connections that created

396
00:20:15,370 --> 00:20:17,690
and actually what's interesting about
this crap is that there's a whole

397
00:20:17,690 --> 00:20:21,360
neighborhood users that increasingly
talk more more to the box

398
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:24,460
than they do with their human friends on

399
00:20:24,460 --> 00:20:28,090
this is cool Prasad um

400
00:20:28,090 --> 00:20:32,418
so so if you're in the audience unlikely
criticism right if you're if you're

401
00:20:32,419 --> 00:20:35,549
kinda keeping up with this raises the
say well maybe it's just Twitter

402
00:20:35,549 --> 00:20:38,679
racism under my bra at this point which
is basically like look

403
00:20:38,679 --> 00:20:41,970
your box are not very sophisticated it
just turns out that the

404
00:20:41,970 --> 00:20:46,289
10 our conversation on mine has become
extremely thin an extremely stupid

405
00:20:46,289 --> 00:20:49,879
which is why robots are able to thrive
right knowledge Dubai but the gun not

406
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:50,679
gone smarter

407
00:20:50,679 --> 00:20:53,970
the humans are just got done a
relatively speaking I'm

408
00:20:53,970 --> 00:20:57,659
and I and we put so to actually but we
actually I'm have been working with a

409
00:20:57,659 --> 00:21:00,280
couple researchers from the University
of British Columbia

410
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:03,860
rachi find at the same pattern actually
emerges on stuff like Facebook right

411
00:21:03,860 --> 00:21:06,880
platforms you would assume a more
difficult the spoof because there's more

412
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:09,919
indicators absurd personality I'm

413
00:21:09,919 --> 00:21:13,710
and and we're finding actually that
relatively simple hacks

414
00:21:13,710 --> 00:21:17,020
are are really really powerful and often
sometimes

415
00:21:17,020 --> 00:21:20,990
the thing that is in fact most a an
impressive in revealing actually back

416
00:21:20,990 --> 00:21:22,049
human behavior

417
00:21:22,049 --> 00:21:25,610
a kind of online zone earlier quick
anecdote about that about have something

418
00:21:25,610 --> 00:21:27,640
that we've been building ever since

419
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:30,809
I'm sorry dealing with this problem for
this happens sometimes in the the bot

420
00:21:30,809 --> 00:21:31,860
beers that someone

421
00:21:31,860 --> 00:21:34,919
accuses your body being a Bach

422
00:21:34,919 --> 00:21:38,870
and the problem is with the box goes to
do and so we're working on a couple

423
00:21:38,870 --> 00:21:41,950
different charges for the longest time
we're likely integrate like the

424
00:21:41,950 --> 00:21:45,720
leanest AI to try to get the back to
respond to this I'm back you thought

425
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:48,600
that I but simply strategy is much
better which is that we have about that

426
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:51,659
accuses humans are being butts reports
the response has been given to the box

427
00:21:51,659 --> 00:21:55,260
to use

428
00:21:55,260 --> 00:21:58,860
and this is really this is really
effective it turns out I just like a

429
00:21:58,860 --> 00:22:00,470
James case we have all these people who
are like

430
00:22:00,470 --> 00:22:04,789
on Stardust I I'm really sorry man you
now and apologizing to the bot

431
00:22:04,789 --> 00:22:10,059
in fact a boxer's song sorta affected
even with the simple strategies that we

432
00:22:10,059 --> 00:22:13,950
well it was it someone fell in love with
whatever Botts but it back someone sort

433
00:22:13,950 --> 00:22:14,539
absurd

434
00:22:14,539 --> 00:22:18,600
learning increasingly erotically Creek
whatever but and win a business-like

435
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:21,850
so did big kinda ethical quandary right
which is like

436
00:22:21,850 --> 00:22:25,159
if we shut up about right away then who
feel like he's turned down if we

437
00:22:25,159 --> 00:22:30,159
it out if we if we keep the bot going
any finds out

438
00:22:30,159 --> 00:22:33,809
I would be really bad but maybe he
doesn't find out the new kind is really

439
00:22:33,809 --> 00:22:34,889
really bad right so

440
00:22:34,890 --> 00:22:38,220
we get your the designer box with social
fail-safe savage attack

441
00:22:38,220 --> 00:22:41,510
if they're getting it through deep
relationship with human and it happens

442
00:22:41,510 --> 00:22:43,840
there just to shut down after shutting
down

443
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:47,850
its 30 min abort mission call that we
have put in dollar box right now

444
00:22:47,850 --> 00:22:50,900
I cuz we we have its prominence I'm

445
00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:54,110
and that but but in just the simple
stuff we've been offering

446
00:22:54,110 --> 00:22:57,360
a sort of thinking more more about to
the complex things that box can do

447
00:22:57,360 --> 00:23:00,419
because we can start stitching them into
other platforms race so

448
00:23:00,419 --> 00:23:04,110
I'm p.m. Sun Chemical Turk models
interesting is basically allows the bot

449
00:23:04,110 --> 00:23:06,320
to hire humans to do the box bidding

450
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:09,580
right and so what's interesting about 30
distributed labor markets like

451
00:23:09,580 --> 00:23:14,178
me a TaskRabbit exact what have you yet
he may be able to hire humans to do

452
00:23:14,179 --> 00:23:17,429
physical changes in the real world based
on what the body's detecting

453
00:23:17,429 --> 00:23:21,200
online in the social space Raven say
move this object from one place to

454
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:23,470
another make a reservation at a
restaurant right

455
00:23:23,470 --> 00:23:26,770
the human can basically be leveraged to
come to get the results that the bot

456
00:23:26,770 --> 00:23:27,990
needs to get done

457
00:23:27,990 --> 00:23:32,330
you know to execute the program is XQ so
this is all kinda fun but when we start

458
00:23:32,330 --> 00:23:35,820
to realize we kinda these examples where
we had more than serve a fun competition

459
00:23:35,820 --> 00:23:37,070
our hands

460
00:23:37,070 --> 00:23:41,590
affectively what we had was a technology
that allowed is basically to reliably

461
00:23:41,590 --> 00:23:44,090
sheep the pattern of connections between
people

462
00:23:44,090 --> 00:23:48,709
online in and a and so residing about
what's next thread is kinda to sponsor a

463
00:23:48,710 --> 00:23:50,580
death rate I don't think that the
project

464
00:23:50,580 --> 00:23:53,830
would like now that we have this now
what do we do it and one thing is the

465
00:23:53,830 --> 00:23:54,340
scale

466
00:23:54,340 --> 00:23:57,959
right but a cheap to launch and but but
that's relatively trivial

467
00:23:57,960 --> 00:24:02,480
ran summertime a to project I'm working
about date suggest kinda where all this

468
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:04,830
is going away this may and up so

469
00:24:04,830 --> 00:24:07,939
on one thing you can think about is
trying to influence human to human

470
00:24:07,940 --> 00:24:11,450
interaction mice in the box were really
good again people to connect you

471
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:15,039
its I but we actually did a suggested
the box a really good again people to

472
00:24:15,039 --> 00:24:16,360
connect with one another

473
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:19,860
right and if he can reliably do this and
we can watch the box for effectively

474
00:24:19,860 --> 00:24:20,570
free

475
00:24:20,570 --> 00:24:24,539
you imagine be seeking to large group
abusers right 10000 EUR 10,000 they're

476
00:24:24,539 --> 00:24:25,140
basically

477
00:24:25,140 --> 00:24:28,600
and about make introductions over a
period of time reno wannabes numbers

478
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:31,679
actually knows that is going on but
slowly increasingly to become more more

479
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:33,039
connected with one another

480
00:24:33,039 --> 00:24:36,750
until you get the network that you want
to create and we can actually give

481
00:24:36,750 --> 00:24:40,309
the box the ability to conduct decide
these types of operations

482
00:24:40,309 --> 00:24:44,090
on basically because we have all these
tools insert social network analysis

483
00:24:44,090 --> 00:24:47,570
that allow them to categorize what are
the relevant communities in a networked

484
00:24:47,570 --> 00:24:48,389
users

485
00:24:48,390 --> 00:24:51,970
and doing how to give them a sort of
social sonar so

486
00:24:51,970 --> 00:24:54,860
I've been talking in the abstract rammed
by the say that this is actually a real

487
00:24:54,860 --> 00:24:58,539
project that we're working on so what we
call a social bridge building project so

488
00:24:58,539 --> 00:25:02,179
and this is a network of about 10,000
users 5,000 once I

489
00:25:02,179 --> 00:25:05,419
I does not the other base in the box
over and it's actually still ongoing

490
00:25:05,419 --> 00:25:06,500
over human period

491
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:10,179
are basically stitching them together
over time right and so increasingly

492
00:25:10,179 --> 00:25:11,080
humans are

493
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:14,080
finding one another have a conversation
small interactions with one another

494
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:17,610
and khaki conduct is basically
large-scale bridge-building I'm watching

495
00:25:17,610 --> 00:25:19,779
without anyone knowing going on this is
going on

496
00:25:19,779 --> 00:25:23,620
joins our work on working on this and
the data initially is actually really

497
00:25:23,620 --> 00:25:25,350
interesting so if you match in years
like

498
00:25:25,350 --> 00:25:28,789
a sector but people and have to meet
each other a certain rate the service

499
00:25:28,789 --> 00:25:29,200
like

500
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:32,220
base level background level friend
creation

501
00:25:32,220 --> 00:25:35,429
my hand and according to what kinda what
we've seen we got two more times the

502
00:25:35,429 --> 00:25:36,049
find out

503
00:25:36,049 --> 00:25:39,360
it actually looks like we can kinda
boost the natural connection rate by 2x

504
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:40,669
3x actually

505
00:25:40,669 --> 00:25:44,200
and was so you cannot imagine using his
body type so the social fertilizer you

506
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:45,400
so to see them in

507
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:48,750
and Italy kinda create the network you
want to see over time

508
00:25:48,750 --> 00:25:51,909
and this is all sort of insidious uses
which will be sure to talk about

509
00:25:51,909 --> 00:25:55,490
a little bit later I watching
implication of this is actually once

510
00:25:55,490 --> 00:25:58,330
that the bridges constructed you
actually end up with box

511
00:25:58,330 --> 00:26:01,689
report embedded in the network right
they have certain credibility the shared

512
00:26:01,690 --> 00:26:03,100
certain types of stories

513
00:26:03,100 --> 00:26:05,880
she'd imagined in certain types of
things wanted them most basically is

514
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:06,370
kinda

515
00:26:06,370 --> 00:26:10,330
on sorter means ran a similar yet take
care the Golden Gate Bridge

516
00:26:10,330 --> 00:26:13,059
baby need to take care the social bridge
between that you're building between

517
00:26:13,059 --> 00:26:14,039
users

518
00:26:14,039 --> 00:26:17,490
so we're thinking like well maybe what
about those attacked oh I created this

519
00:26:17,490 --> 00:26:18,600
relationship between

520
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:22,539
Sals imbaba now's mother no longer
talking into the box designed to drop at

521
00:26:22,539 --> 00:26:25,090
all this content is designed to get
these people talk again sometime

522
00:26:25,090 --> 00:26:29,150
right so hate him you may want to talk
to you XYZ on %um talked in awhile or

523
00:26:29,150 --> 00:26:29,809
hate him

524
00:26:29,809 --> 00:26:32,809
done XYZ to share this link you might
want to check out right to basically

525
00:26:32,809 --> 00:26:36,570
just kinda force this kind not contact
between users

526
00:26:36,570 --> 00:26:39,689
this artist's parties relationships back
up his life again

527
00:26:39,690 --> 00:26:43,070
up a disorder fun things you can start
to do you actually so one experiment

528
00:26:43,070 --> 00:26:45,090
they were planning in the next few
months is something that we call

529
00:26:45,090 --> 00:26:46,390
happiness buffering

530
00:26:46,390 --> 00:26:49,830
and it basically works on a lot of
social science research that suggests

531
00:26:49,830 --> 00:26:53,279
that there's sort of emotional contagion
both in real life and also on social

532
00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:53,870
networks and

533
00:26:53,870 --> 00:26:57,460
this isn't too surprising in Iraq Mossad
agents to serve our to say that

534
00:26:57,460 --> 00:27:00,600
on you know someone who is happy you are
awesome happy

535
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:04,340
in connection right someone your your
friends friend is happy and you are also

536
00:27:04,340 --> 00:27:05,620
likely become happier

537
00:27:05,620 --> 00:27:08,150
connection and and there's a lot of
kinda explanations for why that made

538
00:27:08,150 --> 00:27:08,630
keys

539
00:27:08,630 --> 00:27:11,880
might be the case heartbeats or to peer
effects and

540
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:14,850
actually just like the social network
analysis tools we can actually give the

541
00:27:14,850 --> 00:27:18,140
box the ability to see this as well
right so natural language processing

542
00:27:18,140 --> 00:27:21,970
kinda gives us can give us allow allowed
to give the bot some notion assorted

543
00:27:21,970 --> 00:27:24,510
emotion my db to measure the emotional
state

544
00:27:24,510 --> 00:27:28,120
network and to come away thinking is you
can send the by a bunch a box and

545
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:30,510
basically your monitor and emotional
scene network and the

546
00:27:30,510 --> 00:27:33,710
dips below a certain threshold he
basically designed to be going out

547
00:27:33,710 --> 00:27:36,770
always positive sentiment right to
basically tied up fucker emotional

548
00:27:36,770 --> 00:27:38,330
stated that now we're back again

549
00:27:38,330 --> 00:27:41,699
and you can basically imagine using that
for pushing it up but also keeping it

550
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:43,200
within a particular band right

551
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:46,940
if you're getting too excited release
all this content it's really boring too

552
00:27:46,940 --> 00:27:47,309
kinda

553
00:27:47,309 --> 00:27:51,399
tamp down the effective date right and
basically what we've created

554
00:27:51,399 --> 00:27:55,080
I'm is a really interesting kinda
cognitive lever right into the social

555
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:57,220
networks may be some have a style that
we can say

556
00:27:57,220 --> 00:28:00,630
we're gonna and but this upper campus
down and we're still trying to work out

557
00:28:00,630 --> 00:28:04,740
a strategy at this track is my product
images on the fly over

558
00:28:04,740 --> 00:28:07,500
one other problem baby is everybody's
really depressed in all the batter

559
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:08,140
relatively

560
00:28:08,140 --> 00:28:11,200
much happier it actually might not be a
good thing I'm

561
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:14,770
and 200 I got exactly how to how to
coordinate this but his order fundraiser

562
00:28:14,770 --> 00:28:18,330
concert imagine using these boxes or two
electrodes that allow you to you can

563
00:28:18,330 --> 00:28:19,860
influence the behavior

564
00:28:19,860 --> 00:28:24,399
other social organism I'm and so we talk
about some that the funds are positive

565
00:28:24,399 --> 00:28:26,590
things right but you're probably
thinking okay well

566
00:28:26,590 --> 00:28:30,429
this is really cool but really creepy so
what are some other negative uses so

567
00:28:30,429 --> 00:28:33,779
another project were thinking about
right now is this concept the a social

568
00:28:33,779 --> 00:28:35,669
countries investing kinda gets me to you

569
00:28:35,669 --> 00:28:39,029
what events you wanna kind of clothes on
not today

570
00:28:39,029 --> 00:28:42,490
so just like penetration testing radiate
the question is whether or not we can

571
00:28:42,490 --> 00:28:45,809
use kinda the same techniques that are
used in computer networks

572
00:28:45,809 --> 00:28:49,389
are four social networks as well so that
the permissive social and testing is

573
00:28:49,390 --> 00:28:50,220
very simple

574
00:28:50,220 --> 00:28:53,470
are you basically have a network abuses
you send the box and basically what the

575
00:28:53,470 --> 00:28:55,220
box cue over maybe a few weeks

576
00:28:55,220 --> 00:28:58,260
period or a few month period on is
basically to

577
00:28:58,260 --> 00:29:01,549
sir to spread information with small
inaccuracies rain

578
00:29:01,549 --> 00:29:04,840
ID reader to start eating the poor right
there they're retrieving them

579
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:08,500
a story may be changing the sadistic
slightly and looking for where they're

580
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:10,700
challenged in where they're not
challenge train

581
00:29:10,700 --> 00:29:14,120
and effectively what they're trying to
identify is the person who is the most

582
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:17,870
influential but is the worst at
evaluating whether not something Israel

583
00:29:17,870 --> 00:29:22,830
on a up

584
00:29:22,830 --> 00:29:26,110
to some of you may have met these types
of people before

585
00:29:26,110 --> 00:29:29,580
I the op-ed hold it out with a video yet
in and so

586
00:29:29,580 --> 00:29:33,100
and if you can find that right you're I
guess where this goes at right is the

587
00:29:33,100 --> 00:29:37,130
reverse side in about 100 100 billion a
network great weekend sir have the box

588
00:29:37,130 --> 00:29:39,390
basically see this information in the
network

589
00:29:39,390 --> 00:29:42,900
on which gains credibility and what's
interesting to about this kind of

590
00:29:42,900 --> 00:29:43,799
project is

591
00:29:43,799 --> 00:29:47,309
you could be the smartest person in the
room we don't need to get to you

592
00:29:47,309 --> 00:29:50,620
we just need to get your billable friend
who you trust right and the global for

593
00:29:50,620 --> 00:29:52,460
you trust may be several links away

594
00:29:52,460 --> 00:29:55,789
right but the basket basically
identified the sorts patterns

595
00:29:55,789 --> 00:29:59,190
and an assist in this rain just like a
pen testing read these two approaches

596
00:29:59,190 --> 00:30:01,080
right one of them is you can exploit the
whole

597
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:05,270
or you can fix it and and so this is
kinda fun because it opens up to

598
00:30:05,270 --> 00:30:09,020
diminishing space right disorder human
network says computer networks in

599
00:30:09,020 --> 00:30:12,240
and a question as to how far does that
metaphor go

600
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:15,740
and as a presage a world in which people
to design systems not willing to

601
00:30:15,740 --> 00:30:19,049
sir imports networks in this way but
also sir defend against it

602
00:30:19,049 --> 00:30:22,980
anything he is certain implications of
this are really quite broad

603
00:30:22,980 --> 00:30:26,940
and quite interesting race so one of
them is that sorted mainstream media

604
00:30:26,940 --> 00:30:29,929
increasingly comes to rely on these
networks right which is a huge

605
00:30:29,929 --> 00:30:30,899
vulnerability

606
00:30:30,899 --> 00:30:34,860
I did something like the spots could
explain on you know to the extent that I

607
00:30:34,860 --> 00:30:38,059
think I just heard what is it Fox News
or something actually now has a Twitter

608
00:30:38,059 --> 00:30:38,820
correspond

609
00:30:38,820 --> 00:30:42,000
raise someone who specifically tracks
this but you know they're not very good

610
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,880
at a value rating whether or not
something Israel online right which

611
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:48,330
gives you suddenly a lottery for control
actually over the media cycle as well

612
00:30:48,330 --> 00:30:52,379
up but I think it's more than just
fooling the news-record if that were the

613
00:30:52,380 --> 00:30:54,830
only a commit this I think that would be
fairly trivial

614
00:30:54,830 --> 00:30:57,960
ran I think happens all time I'm but

615
00:30:57,960 --> 00:31:01,669
I think wanna think they're finding your
site expense Rafer so this is a retreat

616
00:31:01,669 --> 00:31:05,110
graph that's it emerged in a way to the
news around Osama bin Laden

617
00:31:05,110 --> 00:31:08,299
and the Research Center suggest BC that
the pattern of connections between

618
00:31:08,299 --> 00:31:09,200
people

619
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:12,929
influence what news is considered
credible right and where public opinion

620
00:31:12,929 --> 00:31:15,200
moves with regards to the fax

621
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:18,490
a million bats really really powerful
thing but on the positive side on

622
00:31:18,490 --> 00:31:19,760
negative side right you can

623
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:22,260
you can imagine for example try to get
people to become more civically engaged

624
00:31:22,260 --> 00:31:23,279
to the spot

625
00:31:23,279 --> 00:31:27,630
I or another person to say well maybe
you know we want to sell coca-cola to

626
00:31:27,630 --> 00:31:28,820
these kids but

627
00:31:28,820 --> 00:31:32,158
I you know we don't advertise them
directly so it's fine what we'll do is

628
00:31:32,159 --> 00:31:35,360
we'll just had those groups abuses
become increasingly connected to users

629
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:37,230
who do drink a lot of coke overtime

630
00:31:37,230 --> 00:31:40,730
and was like kinda the sort of social
influence take the rest of the way

631
00:31:40,730 --> 00:31:45,010
and I think this leads to actually
bigger facts answer why wanna clothes on

632
00:31:45,010 --> 00:31:48,379
I'm we take a lot of work are certain
inspiration from the worker per

633
00:31:48,380 --> 00:31:51,730
a professor at Harvard Medical School
Nicholas Christakis who served more

634
00:31:51,730 --> 00:31:53,840
sorta famous slash infamous for

635
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:57,539
for proposing that stuff like obesity
right is actually has a social element

636
00:31:57,539 --> 00:31:59,030
red is social contagion

637
00:31:59,030 --> 00:32:03,340
I'm eyes serve dimension to it amend you
know someone that you don't know some

638
00:32:03,340 --> 00:32:06,730
Indians lot away trade is actually kind
of some kind of impact and tax you

639
00:32:06,730 --> 00:32:10,539
and so insofar as the box give us some
power over that I think there might be

640
00:32:10,539 --> 00:32:11,179
some sort

641
00:32:11,179 --> 00:32:15,190
really really kinda remarkable certain
possibilities tourism a keeper fairly

642
00:32:15,190 --> 00:32:15,730
short

643
00:32:15,730 --> 00:32:18,870
on and adjust how to turn to the bounce
my time on questions

644
00:32:18,870 --> 00:32:22,110
amber here's or to my obligatory contact
information and

645
00:32:22,110 --> 00:32:29,110
thank you very very much three times
more time

646
00:32:47,100 --> 00:32:50,860
says so I'm curious about people using

647
00:32:50,860 --> 00:32:53,950
bart's for personal gain

648
00:32:53,950 --> 00:32:56,970
to become more popular get more dates

649
00:32:56,970 --> 00:33:01,230
sure acceptor a arm patriotism here

650
00:33:01,230 --> 00:33:06,780
expecting company the question yeah got
sites I go ahead but

651
00:33:06,780 --> 00:33:12,510
is this something that are you done any
research into new indoor

652
00:33:12,510 --> 00:33:16,510
like expect to see becoming a big thing
in the future like everyone has their

653
00:33:16,510 --> 00:33:17,350
own Bob

654
00:33:17,350 --> 00:33:20,360
yet it's possible record I think

655
00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:24,179
so yes I definitely think that's the
case right like it starts with the most

656
00:33:24,179 --> 00:33:26,190
up involve people right for partitions

657
00:33:26,190 --> 00:33:29,290
right who who need to boost their
numbers for a number of reasons right

658
00:33:29,290 --> 00:33:32,809
and then I think naturally you'll just
have to see a trickle down right where

659
00:33:32,809 --> 00:33:33,690
it's like why not

660
00:33:33,690 --> 00:33:36,830
get a bunch of dollars rent is actually
happens a lot rate is actually

661
00:33:36,830 --> 00:33:40,690
if you search buy Twitter followers are
you know wanted them to turn a breakaway

662
00:33:40,690 --> 00:33:43,670
companies that would just be able to
like Bay City deploy a bunch a spam bot

663
00:33:43,670 --> 00:33:47,370
the volume I'm I think all what's
interesting though is that it's sorta

664
00:33:47,370 --> 00:33:49,580
touches of an arms race right because

665
00:33:49,580 --> 00:33:52,770
some media everybody knows that
everybody has a bunch a box who are

666
00:33:52,770 --> 00:33:55,980
following them tried to book bolster how
popular they look

667
00:33:55,980 --> 00:33:59,830
I'm man you wanna designs is instructed
to tack rain and so

668
00:33:59,830 --> 00:34:02,970
I think it ultimately ends up being that
no one really wins it's a sign like the

669
00:34:02,970 --> 00:34:03,940
box come into place

670
00:34:03,940 --> 00:34:07,150
some people create smoke detection
systems them to create smarter box

671
00:34:07,150 --> 00:34:10,710
and again it's kinda goes back and forth
like that I'm so i i think it's

672
00:34:10,710 --> 00:34:13,740
something you'll see in the future but I
think it's part of a much larger picture

673
00:34:13,740 --> 00:34:14,270
about

674
00:34:14,270 --> 00:34:18,359
I'm sorta credibility on line in Canada
systems that come up to sort of deal

675
00:34:18,359 --> 00:34:18,790
with that

676
00:34:18,790 --> 00:34:23,429
on but yeah I can I suppose you could be
used to get dates I mean I know

677
00:34:23,429 --> 00:34:27,210
there's acted yesterday Santoso it was
an OK Cupid but some other dating site

678
00:34:27,210 --> 00:34:28,850
that it turned out that they were using
pot

679
00:34:28,850 --> 00:34:33,279
the kinda keep users on the site which
is like really ridiculous but busy idea

680
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:35,990
is likely if the user's inactive for a
period of time

681
00:34:35,990 --> 00:34:40,510
like a good looking person will message
them I decided to keep them on the

682
00:34:40,510 --> 00:34:41,190
network

683
00:34:41,190 --> 00:34:44,859
I'm so is the iMac and you'll see uses
like that future for sure

684
00:34:44,859 --> 00:34:48,609
thanks meh

685
00:34:48,609 --> 00:34:52,029
act mister on human rights in China at
and

686
00:34:52,030 --> 00:34:56,530
on this is really alarming a wonderful
wonderful hockey non-military

687
00:34:56,530 --> 00:34:59,970
else although the lining is one thing
that's been happening me know is that

688
00:34:59,970 --> 00:35:04,550
arm people can introduce really
controversy L

689
00:35:04,550 --> 00:35:08,400
I or you will just news there hasn't
been censored

690
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:12,119
really quickly and microblogs in China
and then it gets pretty far before

691
00:35:12,119 --> 00:35:13,470
against him down

692
00:35:13,470 --> 00:35:17,710
on and and when he could talk about
potential in the various uses

693
00:35:17,710 --> 00:35:22,300
I'll the materials that you are not play
governments that are trying to censor

694
00:35:22,300 --> 00:35:23,470
users are some

695
00:35:23,470 --> 00:35:27,840
range right definitely on so yeah I
think it is certainly a couple things

696
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:29,720
they can imagine that are that are the

697
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:33,560
dike the the ways you can imagine this
technology being used to sorta tamp down

698
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:37,480
activists resso wanted them certainly is
kinda what's been tried in

699
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:42,000
in Syria and elsewhere and the cases I
talked about as I mention I'm not too

700
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,880
concerned about those the bottom it's a
relatively crude

701
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:48,359
right there so noisy that you can you
imagine a sufficiently smart

702
00:35:48,359 --> 00:35:49,009
technologies

703
00:35:49,010 --> 00:35:53,170
designing systems and building our I
think the bigger problem comes when

704
00:35:53,170 --> 00:35:56,390
basically governments realize the
strategy isn't attractive on

705
00:35:56,390 --> 00:35:59,920
increase the Norway's or censor the user
but allows user to

706
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:02,990
operate but kinda sheep the social
universe around them

707
00:36:02,990 --> 00:36:06,640
so wanted them is you can imagine saying
well on

708
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:11,430
you know we can get a buncha on we can
get a much about the Polish activists

709
00:36:11,430 --> 00:36:11,899
and then

710
00:36:11,900 --> 00:36:15,880
1c sufficiently kinda within that
network we can get him to spread false

711
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:17,590
information we can lead to discredit him
with

712
00:36:17,590 --> 00:36:21,980
right that's pretty big I'm I think
there's anything which is just a matter

713
00:36:21,980 --> 00:36:23,850
sir surveillance keeping tabs

714
00:36:23,850 --> 00:36:27,299
on and so i think is yet is usually a
number deuces

715
00:36:27,300 --> 00:36:30,910
anything again disorder disarms reseller
networks I can we design technology fast

716
00:36:30,910 --> 00:36:31,569
enough

717
00:36:31,570 --> 00:36:35,560
are meeting right now it seems like on
you know the bot's

718
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:38,779
are the government I'm really caught on
today and I think

719
00:36:38,780 --> 00:36:42,380
if this up and hopping about in terms of
kinda like the large landscape shipping

720
00:36:42,380 --> 00:36:43,480
stuff becomes bigger

721
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:46,520
they may not even need to deal with the
activists record the ideas just like to

722
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:47,090
shape

723
00:36:47,090 --> 00:36:50,340
the pattern of behavior on these
networks in a way with the norms

724
00:36:50,340 --> 00:36:53,830
don't support spreading misinformation
brand then you're in real trouble right

725
00:36:53,830 --> 00:36:55,900
because the Indian Union have a base to
talk to him

726
00:36:55,900 --> 00:36:59,700
I'm bad to my knowledge I I don't think
anyone's doing that anything that's

727
00:36:59,700 --> 00:37:01,280
stupid so far but that we know about

728
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:07,910
I'm to thank you so much such a great
time banks hi

729
00:37:07,910 --> 00:37:11,629
arm I think there's the huge potential
theory evil here

730
00:37:11,630 --> 00:37:16,000
there was also some I sleep its sole
honestly so cool that there's also a

731
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,160
huge potential for good

732
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:20,490
wooden arm somebody once introduced me
to a project where what you trying to do

733
00:37:20,490 --> 00:37:23,220
is introduce people on opposite sides in
the war zone

734
00:37:23,220 --> 00:37:27,250
him to become pen pals the idea being
that because you see that the person on

735
00:37:27,250 --> 00:37:29,010
the other side is really human

736
00:37:29,010 --> 00:37:33,570
arm you can influence your government
and influence politics in a way that

737
00:37:33,570 --> 00:37:36,910
you %ah reduce the inclination towards

738
00:37:36,910 --> 00:37:40,089
arm following the government propaganda
to continue into

739
00:37:40,090 --> 00:37:43,540
workmen so I was ejected for

740
00:37:43,540 --> 00:37:48,220
arm it's very new mmm it's a very very
cool concept is very simple but it

741
00:37:48,220 --> 00:37:51,460
it deals with very simple things like
for example on

742
00:37:51,460 --> 00:37:54,790
if you're in israel and you play tennis

743
00:37:54,790 --> 00:37:59,029
and somebody else's in Iran they play
tennis psych 101 just talk about tennis

744
00:37:59,030 --> 00:38:01,430
in tennis clubs and what you doing stuff
like that

745
00:38:01,430 --> 00:38:04,629
and you get people who are talking about

746
00:38:04,630 --> 00:38:08,220
really generic you daily kinda things

747
00:38:08,220 --> 00:38:12,450
on on opposite sides have in aq is not a
war zone but

748
00:38:12,450 --> 00:38:16,810
a heated political climate recognizes
the OPs laser-like

749
00:38:16,810 --> 00:38:20,620
NDP start with a 10 asserts like
surprises repairs earlier like

750
00:38:20,620 --> 00:38:25,680
oh no no no yeah

751
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:29,350
its I don't know I don't aggressed too
much big star yeah I don't remember

752
00:38:29,350 --> 00:38:31,910
where I can remember the mills are you

753
00:38:31,910 --> 00:38:35,040
thought it was very cool but but
principal was that you knew

754
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:38,200
full well you're getting into it and
dryer are you an Iranian in your like

755
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:40,550
okay cool I wanna talk to somebody from
Israel

756
00:38:40,550 --> 00:38:44,070
that I'm I have a common interest in
water my interest blah blah blah blah

757
00:38:44,070 --> 00:38:45,490
blah and then it connects you

758
00:38:45,490 --> 00:38:48,780
writer chatting so very open up various
very safe and all that

759
00:38:48,780 --> 00:38:52,250
dress was thinking about this while you
had your talk %uh like when I could take

760
00:38:52,250 --> 00:38:56,800
you know you know by 10,000 people from
one side bordered by 10,000 people from

761
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:57,940
another side the border

762
00:38:57,940 --> 00:39:02,270
and either well get them thinking at the
same thing in talking to one another and

763
00:39:02,270 --> 00:39:03,430
having fun together

764
00:39:03,430 --> 00:39:08,120
or you could make things more hostile
yeah trough rather's

765
00:39:08,120 --> 00:39:11,290
some really evil potential yeah I think
it works both ways like I think it

766
00:39:11,290 --> 00:39:12,170
really is

767
00:39:12,170 --> 00:39:15,350
I'd say it's going to be an RA are
generating it's a gun you know I think I

768
00:39:15,350 --> 00:39:15,839
think

769
00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:18,780
like waders this interesting elements
you which i think the technology can

770
00:39:18,780 --> 00:39:19,840
really be used in

771
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:23,440
in both directions rare and I think

772
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:28,380
you know the mind really has a way going
towards the not so great stuff

773
00:39:28,380 --> 00:39:30,880
but I agree with you i mean i think is a
couple applications we've been thinking

774
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:32,130
about where

775
00:39:32,130 --> 00:39:34,880
you know even having about being
transparent might actually be really

776
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:35,840
powerful thing

777
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:39,490
right so unwanted things they found for
example when they're kinda post-election

778
00:39:39,490 --> 00:39:41,240
crisis in Iran was going on

779
00:39:41,240 --> 00:39:44,480
was that there's basically a small group
I've sorted X had

780
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:48,000
bilingual users the played a really big
role in BC translating what was

781
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,270
happening on the ground future the
mainstream media

782
00:39:50,270 --> 00:39:53,770
large right you'd imagine situations
were not every movement has that

783
00:39:53,770 --> 00:39:55,140
critical mass abusers

784
00:39:55,140 --> 00:39:59,400
yes your translator box right there
basically helping to like create

785
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:03,400
more are lowered by the fiction stories
flowing from one party network to the

786
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:04,120
other

787
00:40:04,120 --> 00:40:07,640
rain at one case in which the bout to be
completely transparent on biking have

788
00:40:07,640 --> 00:40:09,870
some really good positive uses as well

789
00:40:09,870 --> 00:40:13,890
on both integrated communication and
onwards at the very curious to see what

790
00:40:13,890 --> 00:40:15,509
happens in the future with your project

791
00:40:15,510 --> 00:40:19,359
thank you thank you I'm

792
00:40:19,359 --> 00:40:24,029
are great talk thank you I just want you
ask a little bit about suffer testing

793
00:40:24,030 --> 00:40:29,100
implications are above these networks
right now if you're a web developer

794
00:40:29,100 --> 00:40:32,880
and say you're relying on Facebook aloft
manager

795
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:37,420
facebook allows you to create I a group
of test users

796
00:40:37,420 --> 00:40:40,790
and their network as they relate to each
other mom

797
00:40:40,790 --> 00:40:45,470
I am which is great for some basic
scenarios bites

798
00:40:45,470 --> 00:40:48,690
to really exercised narratives and

799
00:40:48,690 --> 00:40:53,580
personas that you want your potential
software to

800
00:40:53,580 --> 00:40:57,930
be part of in on this would be really
useful

801
00:40:57,930 --> 00:41:01,359
yeah I think serbia i think is probably
less on

802
00:41:01,359 --> 00:41:04,029
never retire was talking with a friend
recently it's kinda like well you know

803
00:41:04,030 --> 00:41:04,730
there's actually

804
00:41:04,730 --> 00:41:07,560
I dislike a lot apart you can pull out
of this that would be useful in other

805
00:41:07,560 --> 00:41:11,910
applications that don't seem like so
insidious are so high stakes rank 1 a.m.

806
00:41:11,910 --> 00:41:14,980
like definitely not is there are there
any like initial

807
00:41:14,980 --> 00:41:18,060
frameworks for creating networks a box

808
00:41:18,060 --> 00:41:22,880
to you exercise your own site for I
think probably the

809
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:26,000
you can touch I mean we haven't really
done much work into it but I think

810
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:29,310
there's no dues deduction nothing saying
that you can just kinda retrofit

811
00:41:29,310 --> 00:41:33,509
you know the bus to do that for sure
start thank you thank you

812
00:41:33,510 --> 00:41:36,960
in line with that how hard is it to
afford new to begin implementing

813
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:40,920
some these parts not very difficult at
all actually which is i think was really

814
00:41:40,920 --> 00:41:42,730
fun about the whole project

815
00:41:42,730 --> 00:41:46,720
on both because the time to set up is
very short and built it was simple

816
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:48,140
programs me to really interesting

817
00:41:48,140 --> 00:41:52,109
fax does it require the computer be
online 24/7 I E

818
00:41:52,109 --> 00:41:56,020
ideally actually but we've actually
founded boxer more credible if they go

819
00:41:56,020 --> 00:41:57,600
to sleep just like humans them

820
00:41:57,600 --> 00:42:01,250
a hug so yes there is some in the
bathroom design become like a less

821
00:42:01,250 --> 00:42:04,670
active during the evenings a stop
tweeting at all during the evenings

822
00:42:04,670 --> 00:42:08,170
Amanda and Sony is necessarily have to
require to be on all the time

823
00:42:08,170 --> 00:42:11,970
your so is this offer actually open
sourced I yeah we can actually get

824
00:42:11,970 --> 00:42:16,380
if you search for it should be store
online the Ripon the code for all

825
00:42:16,380 --> 00:42:21,080
the pots from the regional competition
available under my Tia online

826
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:24,220
on there's a disaster dotnet
applications Monroe 1

827
00:42:24,220 --> 00:42:28,100
but I it's all it's all there I N was
there any instance since i was just

828
00:42:28,100 --> 00:42:30,510
curious if char baj randomly

829
00:42:30,510 --> 00:42:34,980
arm toward we are discovered strategies
that humans

830
00:42:34,980 --> 00:42:39,020
could use in their personal social media
lives in so this is actually really

831
00:42:39,020 --> 00:42:39,730
think so

832
00:42:39,730 --> 00:42:43,560
a lot about were playing around with
insert mark 1 were basically be static

833
00:42:43,560 --> 00:42:45,279
strategy is basically the bot

834
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:48,970
on would just say you're percent
personal the assessor tactics to run

835
00:42:48,970 --> 00:42:49,720
with it

836
00:42:49,720 --> 00:42:53,300
amber increasingly thank you what we're
working on is essentially

837
00:42:53,300 --> 00:42:57,140
on the box will have a sincere library a
different tactics in a library a

838
00:42:57,140 --> 00:42:59,109
different personality characteristics

839
00:42:59,109 --> 00:43:02,370
and so when you drop them into network
to basically black right there like I'm

840
00:43:02,370 --> 00:43:03,490
a guy in New York

841
00:43:03,490 --> 00:43:07,150
on but over time the test out what types
of things that a person on what types

842
00:43:07,150 --> 00:43:09,350
packets are most responsive within the
community

843
00:43:09,350 --> 00:43:12,640
and in the kinda shit their personality
accordingly right and even how to do

844
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:14,279
that because the word searches update

845
00:43:14,280 --> 00:43:17,290
real this will work this time this one
work this time and to basically the bus

846
00:43:17,290 --> 00:43:20,050
ride to pick up a configuration
personality and tactics

847
00:43:20,050 --> 00:43:24,710
will get me the best result on and a and
much like humans act as we humans do

848
00:43:24,710 --> 00:43:27,530
right there like I'm in this context
he's a certain things that people

849
00:43:27,530 --> 00:43:29,510
respond to someone to do that more

850
00:43:29,510 --> 00:43:32,350
nominating really excited about the
cruise over time like BC the box will

851
00:43:32,350 --> 00:43:32,900
just

852
00:43:32,900 --> 00:43:36,319
their plastic cradle basically shape to
contain put them in

853
00:43:36,319 --> 00:43:40,569
Sam that's fascinating thank you for the
great talk thank you

854
00:43:40,569 --> 00:43:43,880
million sure that I think spasm actually
curious and I don't know there's a lot

855
00:43:43,880 --> 00:43:45,830
of material to go on this but

856
00:43:45,830 --> 00:43:49,850
develop on what you're doing then terms
and emotional contagion in red on social

857
00:43:49,850 --> 00:43:50,940
networks

858
00:43:50,940 --> 00:43:54,010
particularly in terms of certain
artificially creating a band

859
00:43:54,010 --> 00:43:57,780
zing emotional range right and I was
wondering if if any work has been done

860
00:43:57,780 --> 00:44:01,400
to determine whether there's a natural
bandit like communist aces that happens

861
00:44:01,400 --> 00:44:02,280
before by

862
00:44:02,280 --> 00:44:05,960
intervention on those networks are but
yes 01

863
00:44:05,960 --> 00:44:09,710
we've run into this problem is they have
talked before like a number sir academic

864
00:44:09,710 --> 00:44:10,550
audiences in

865
00:44:10,550 --> 00:44:13,280
and the response very much like this is
really cool this gives all sorts a

866
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:16,180
result we could never ever touched this
this is like

867
00:44:16,180 --> 00:44:19,580
yes pilot every I and it was not
permitted in India today

868
00:44:19,580 --> 00:44:23,180
probably correct the problem is that is
not actually a whole lotta

869
00:44:23,180 --> 00:44:26,259
research Mon on this into an art it's
like

870
00:44:26,260 --> 00:44:29,550
that the folks the university bridge
Colombian like us and then like maybe

871
00:44:29,550 --> 00:44:30,200
other creepy

872
00:44:30,200 --> 00:44:34,109
weren't I and and so

873
00:44:34,109 --> 00:44:37,440
so I don't know actually non you know
whether or not

874
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:41,250
to the emotional state nom cheddar

875
00:44:41,250 --> 00:44:45,260
BC has an equilibrium with the answer on
I think that's probably what we're gonna

876
00:44:45,260 --> 00:44:49,280
find out in the research we're gonna do
with the con happens befor project

877
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:52,580
on thanks our

878
00:44:52,580 --> 00:44:55,640
your ethnic thank you awesome tell

879
00:44:55,640 --> 00:44:59,779
thanks we questioned the you talked
about the fact that you were

880
00:44:59,780 --> 00:45:03,150
connecting user communities that are on
the same side in

881
00:45:03,150 --> 00:45:06,710
and there's a positive feedback button
and then you mention about the ability

882
00:45:06,710 --> 00:45:07,270
to

883
00:45:07,270 --> 00:45:10,730
possibly use it for commercial use you
drink ok you don't think ok you connect

884
00:45:10,730 --> 00:45:11,980
them into a drink more

885
00:45:11,980 --> 00:45:15,900
in is there a better chance that it will
be a negative backlash in those are

886
00:45:15,900 --> 00:45:16,910
drinking Coke you

887
00:45:16,910 --> 00:45:20,399
start losing the urge to drink 0

888
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:24,430
a ride does he think actually that
there's like them yeah i think is a lot

889
00:45:24,430 --> 00:45:27,259
a lot a social stuff it does work like
this right returns at like everybody's

890
00:45:27,260 --> 00:45:27,770
doing it

891
00:45:27,770 --> 00:45:31,920
it must suck you know how on like
granulite your

892
00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:35,589
you actually against the you don't bring
because you know it's bad for you so you

893
00:45:35,589 --> 00:45:38,130
talk to them and convince them that
that's a bad thing

894
00:45:38,130 --> 00:45:41,000
right right anything with a lot of this
stuff there there isn't there's

895
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:42,600
certainly an element of playing with
fire

896
00:45:42,600 --> 00:45:45,930
right so as possible and and i actually
i mean given

897
00:45:45,930 --> 00:45:49,640
you know the way marketing usually works
I totally believe that some company will

898
00:45:49,640 --> 00:45:52,609
try this and it will totally blow up in
your face at some point

899
00:45:52,609 --> 00:45:56,580
um just because that's sorted the nature
the world but I think

900
00:45:56,580 --> 00:46:00,580
and so I agree with you i mean i think
is a lot of situations where that could

901
00:46:00,580 --> 00:46:01,440
occur

902
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:05,680
on rematch in that like a if it
sufficiently activists user is in play

903
00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:08,790
he may actually he may actually kinda
disrupt your model

904
00:46:08,790 --> 00:46:12,009
biting with the box do in that case is
just know to avoid those types

905
00:46:12,010 --> 00:46:15,000
obstacles which it uses really
interesting engineering problem like how

906
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:16,470
do you figure out who's going to follow
the bar

907
00:46:16,470 --> 00:46:19,650
and who's not on and a and whatever

908
00:46:19,650 --> 00:46:23,800
a collaborator issues at Stanford last
year I was working fine on this threat

909
00:46:23,800 --> 00:46:24,750
models actually

910
00:46:24,750 --> 00:46:28,089
ray Hughes taking the that model from
the competition and saying out all those

911
00:46:28,089 --> 00:46:29,970
users who are the most susceptible to
buy

912
00:46:29,970 --> 00:46:33,410
influence and he's had a working on a
couple them but initial results is

913
00:46:33,410 --> 00:46:36,580
suggest that basically people kinda like
on the edges that the network don't talk

914
00:46:36,580 --> 00:46:37,630
to many other users

915
00:46:37,630 --> 00:46:41,790
interact very highly with the batsman so
unique imagine kinda

916
00:46:41,790 --> 00:46:45,339
more sophisticated interaction models
with the back basically goes after this

917
00:46:45,339 --> 00:46:48,020
and uses for seven tries to move in on
the network

918
00:46:48,020 --> 00:46:51,500
on you know we're listening like there
may even be room for like box to work

919
00:46:51,500 --> 00:46:52,880
together in swarms race

920
00:46:52,880 --> 00:46:55,990
one buys the bad cop another Hot Buys
the good cop like

921
00:46:55,990 --> 00:46:58,839
you suck and the other but like don't
say that about him and everything about

922
00:46:58,839 --> 00:47:00,560
you is that the kinda level in

923
00:47:00,560 --> 00:47:05,069
I'm so i think is a world of tactics
here %uh love them that might get around

924
00:47:05,069 --> 00:47:06,100
that sort problem

925
00:47:06,100 --> 00:47:09,390
but I get into the researchers the
low-temperature yeah I think that the

926
00:47:09,390 --> 00:47:13,080
it may be even more complex in the case
of opposing

927
00:47:13,080 --> 00:47:16,620
political opinion on something because
then he you can on

928
00:47:16,620 --> 00:47:20,240
here you're trying to connect them so
they can get trends but you might create

929
00:47:20,240 --> 00:47:23,270
and Julia again an exponential

930
00:47:23,270 --> 00:47:26,940
more more extremist positions being

931
00:47:26,940 --> 00:47:30,520
suede one ran and I think we're gonna
have to design this bill season ranking

932
00:47:30,520 --> 00:47:33,050
the same situation is like someone
falling in love with the bokram

933
00:47:33,050 --> 00:47:37,109
Mike sometimes you just need to like put
a cap on itself yeah

934
00:47:37,109 --> 00:47:40,250
thank you

935
00:47:40,250 --> 00:47:43,740
am you know you're sort of that and
social but where

936
00:47:43,740 --> 00:47:46,630
entered in the local price competition
would you think would be its strengths

937
00:47:46,630 --> 00:47:47,520
and when you think would be

938
00:47:47,520 --> 00:47:51,620
sweetness is on yeah I think I think you
would lose

939
00:47:51,620 --> 00:47:56,080
yeah I mean I think you know with this
is interesting because it turns out

940
00:47:56,080 --> 00:48:00,060
like that the the Turing test type
things attack competitions are

941
00:48:00,060 --> 00:48:03,670
easy to be on stuff like Twitter these
conversations then

942
00:48:03,670 --> 00:48:07,359
like a lot of these papers now these
fall apart on want one communication

943
00:48:07,359 --> 00:48:11,620
said if someone sufficiently aware and
is it distorted and information

944
00:48:11,620 --> 00:48:14,680
they can really just camera the bottles
for falls apart

945
00:48:14,680 --> 00:48:17,879
on hand and that is certainly something
that happens on

946
00:48:17,880 --> 00:48:21,080
and so I think against traditional AI
competitions

947
00:48:21,080 --> 00:48:25,230
hi they may actually not fare so well on
but they're particularly good on my just

948
00:48:25,230 --> 00:48:26,720
because it's sort of like how we've

949
00:48:26,720 --> 00:48:29,859
what are the norms around that platform
arm

950
00:48:29,859 --> 00:48:32,220
although i think is a kid is really
interesting merger actually between

951
00:48:32,220 --> 00:48:36,670
those two at some point representing
with a lot like Boehner prize

952
00:48:36,670 --> 00:48:40,500
like stronger really researched really
powerful honey i's

953
00:48:40,500 --> 00:48:43,550
is that it tends to be you know more
competition intensive

954
00:48:43,550 --> 00:48:46,890
rain and so you imagine system with
Bobby C's is really simple strategies

955
00:48:46,890 --> 00:48:47,220
but

956
00:48:47,220 --> 00:48:51,319
realized same troubling pack Hall
something more sophisticated and

957
00:48:51,319 --> 00:48:54,600
or even call human Ryan on and so

958
00:48:54,600 --> 00:48:57,720
sega's my answers like it it's all the
complex Belize for like mostly I

959
00:48:57,720 --> 00:48:58,870
competitions where

960
00:48:58,870 --> 00:49:04,040
is very much 121 interaction on they
would not be a strong for sure

961
00:49:04,040 --> 00:49:07,740
thank you angry presentation great thank
you

962
00:49:07,740 --> 00:49:11,720
cool I'd think a former mbeki perfect
with time

963
00:49:11,720 --> 00:49:16,040
alright so um basically as I see it
right now like the worst case scenario

964
00:49:16,040 --> 00:49:18,259
for your body's like you have these feel
saves

965
00:49:18,260 --> 00:49:21,480
programmed in and shut them off if
something goes wrong

966
00:49:21,480 --> 00:49:25,600
what is the worst case scenario like I
see no negative repercussions for the

967
00:49:25,600 --> 00:49:26,780
Bach creator

968
00:49:26,780 --> 00:49:30,080
pretty much no matter what like your you
pretty easily able to hide yourself

969
00:49:30,080 --> 00:49:33,910
and just shut these often get out is
there any negative repercussions even

970
00:49:33,910 --> 00:49:35,879
possible for the creators

971
00:49:35,880 --> 00:49:39,520
not really now I don't think so which is
why I think actually like you

972
00:49:39,520 --> 00:49:42,710
I see more this that the politics over
time because the

973
00:49:42,710 --> 00:49:47,350
the usual question is like am I gonna be
found out for using box that support me

974
00:49:47,350 --> 00:49:50,509
by I think with you know we'd even like
a little bit as

975
00:49:50,510 --> 00:49:54,120
cation it becomes very difficult to
detect who's behind the sorts of things

976
00:49:54,120 --> 00:49:57,640
in assuming it's difficult act like
who's behind the Amazon stuff for the

977
00:49:57,640 --> 00:50:00,910
the other quantitative trading wrestle a
pattern they found between and have a

978
00:50:00,910 --> 00:50:01,990
member trap away

979
00:50:01,990 --> 00:50:04,720
basically happened and in a few months
later they look for it was no longer

980
00:50:04,720 --> 00:50:07,089
there expert in with someone fix the
program

981
00:50:07,089 --> 00:50:11,069
but it's difficult to tell with some the
system's on

982
00:50:11,069 --> 00:50:14,520
so yeah I me i i think i think there's
the the possibility of negative

983
00:50:14,520 --> 00:50:15,770
reproductive

984
00:50:15,770 --> 00:50:19,740
repercussion is actually quite low Sam

985
00:50:19,740 --> 00:50:26,740
cool I think that song thank you very
much

986
00:50:31,960 --> 00:50:32,320
him
