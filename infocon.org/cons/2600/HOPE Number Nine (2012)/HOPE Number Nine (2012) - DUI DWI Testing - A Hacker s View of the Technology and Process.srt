1

2
00:00:03,090 --> 00:00:08,870

4
00:00:12,590 --> 00:00:16,660
was going to be given by two other
people and it seemed to be that well

5
00:00:16,660 --> 00:00:20,820
they have jobs and such in and people
leaned on them to not give the talk

6
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:24,570
so I Josh was volunteered to give

7
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:28,970
the police law enforcement side in I was
asked to give the legal side but I've

8
00:00:28,970 --> 00:00:29,609
decided that

9
00:00:29,609 --> 00:00:32,850
I warm instead present anonymously

10
00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:38,450
so that way no one knows who I am

11
00:00:38,450 --> 00:00:41,710

Alex and me

17
00:01:00,190 --> 00:01:05,229
Josh up this is not our employers

factual

19
00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:13,979
but not our opinions all pretty much
we're going to talk about his factual

20
00:01:13,979 --> 00:01:18,580
Miami ordered we're gonna be doing is
explaining

21
00:01:18,580 --> 00:01:22,509
DWI DUI we're gonna be talking about
what happens during

22
00:01:22,509 --> 00:01:26,689
pre arrest arrest but after a rest
mostly jokes

23
00:01:26,689 --> 00:01:31,930
we're gonna be talking about what
happens how it happens physiological

24
00:01:31,930 --> 00:01:34,990
physically psychologically also two
different things

25
00:01:34,990 --> 00:01:38,610
this is not how do I beat this is

26
00:01:38,610 --> 00:01:41,610
what's going to happen to me what should
I be afraid of

27
00:01:41,610 --> 00:01:46,289
because we're gonna scare you straight
forgave that's the way you are

28

no offense intended so

29
00:01:50,369 --> 00:01:53,409
we don't care about your DUI case honest
I

30
00:01:53,409 --> 00:01:56,670
don't give a crap okay if you have a DUI
case

31
00:01:56,670 --> 00:02:00,210
because you drink and drive you're an
idiot

32
00:02:00,210 --> 00:02:05,409
if you have a DUI case because you were
hopped up on adderall and you like but

33
00:02:05,409 --> 00:02:06,619
it was now call

34
00:02:06,619 --> 00:02:11,239
you're an idiot if you have a DUI case

35
00:02:11,239 --> 00:02:14,879
because it's DUI driving under the
influence not driving wall

36
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:18,500
drunk because you had cocaine heroin
speed

37
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:22,300
speedball crushed adderall snorted to
your ass whatever

38
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:26,819

39
00:02:26,819 --> 00:02:30,920
don't rock and drive hell have you
probably shouldn't drive but that's

40
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:31,599
another story

41
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:36,750

will go over as we go along gee this is
tough

43
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:46,359

57
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:57,799

58
00:03:58,930 --> 00:04:05,760
go to slideshow

59
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:10,399

62
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:25,550
arm

63
00:04:25,550 --> 00:04:28,570
I'm gonna go through the basics a
criminal on the United States

64
00:04:28,570 --> 00:04:32,719
arm what does it take to go from what
does it take for a law enforcement

65
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,180
officer to legally

66
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:38,080
stop you arrest you convict you

67
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:41,800
arm the

68
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:45,540
three standards by which they have to be
able to stop you is article will

69
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:46,729
suspicion that you i've

70
00:04:46,729 --> 00:04:49,840
you are the on acting

71
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:53,650
at you're committing a crime are

72
00:04:53,650 --> 00:04:57,130
they can stop you if it is a I some
kinda checkpoint were

73
00:04:57,130 --> 00:05:00,930
everybody gets top where check and it
doesn't have to be for DUI could be

74
00:05:00,930 --> 00:05:01,620
something like

75
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:07,210
we are checking every car to see if its
toll arm

76
00:05:07,210 --> 00:05:12,409
maximum gonna talk about is are what to
take to convict you

77
00:05:12,410 --> 00:05:18,870
and then what defenses you've got I'll
any one of her biggest things is

78
00:05:18,870 --> 00:05:22,440
in in the american justices mccauley
exclusionary rule which says

79
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:27,740
it'll evidence is a legally taken from
you it cannot be used against you

80
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:31,010
general and

81
00:05:31,010 --> 00:05:35,450
what happens when you refuse to submit
to testing and serve how this plays out

82
00:05:35,450 --> 00:05:36,789
between civil law

83
00:05:36,789 --> 00:05:39,960
in criminal law okay

84
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:46,960
Josh alright

85
00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:50,289
there's a lot of misconceptions

86
00:05:50,289 --> 00:05:54,430
as lot of people going all if you do
this to work if you put this if you do

87
00:05:54,430 --> 00:05:56,530
this if you're happened to drive this
way

88
00:05:56,530 --> 00:06:00,380
don't take that road do this yeah ninety
percent of her bullshit

89
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:05,479
okay let's be honest here let's talk
about the stuff we got why is the legal

90
00:06:05,479 --> 00:06:06,020
limit

91
00:06:06,020 --> 00:06:10,460
point away as anybody now demeanor would
point to a means

92
00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:13,539
my way presented your blood is actually
alcohol

93
00:06:13,539 --> 00:06:18,710
okay so is there any alcohol in your
blood is any blood in your own home

94
00:06:18,710 --> 00:06:23,250
0.08 tiny little fraction was not get
trashed used to be a list a 10-point

95
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:23,800
more

96
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:26,810
20.1 love loaded 2.08

97
00:06:26,810 --> 00:06:30,409
federal highway funds are a lot of that
along with speed limits

98
00:06:30,409 --> 00:06:33,870
a ager drinking things like that okay

99
00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:37,120
but DWI

100
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:41,440
is the basically like it a point to a
2.1

101
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:44,820
a pureblood is alcohol and it doesn't
have to be

102
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:49,110
alcohol member DUI driving under the
influence of what

103
00:06:49,110 --> 00:06:52,599
doesn't friggin matter okay among
cocaine

104
00:06:52,599 --> 00:06:55,680
they can't give me a DUI yes they can

105
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:59,789
they don't have to have a breathalyzer
Intoxilyzer test

106
00:06:59,789 --> 00:07:03,680
to arrest you were convicted for DUI
they can have

107
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:07,340
he's really fucked up but they can
actually stop you if your blood is

108
00:07:07,340 --> 00:07:07,909
actually

109
00:07:07,909 --> 00:07:11,620
point 2008 cocaine cos and I think
you'll ever stop

110
00:07:11,620 --> 00:07:15,479
I so

111
00:07:15,479 --> 00:07:19,320
okay let's talk about when you actually
get pulled over very rarely

112
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:23,460
alright it it's an amazing amount of
cars out there and they're not nearly as

113
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:24,349
many cops

114
00:07:24,349 --> 00:07:28,219
they're never gonna pull me over yet
your

115
00:07:28,219 --> 00:07:31,800
you're weaving all over the road to go
you know sums wrong with that guy

116
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:35,820
let's go take a look so

117
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:38,969
the actual odds of getting pulled over
and arrested are actually

118
00:07:38,969 --> 00:07:43,159
not that high but their high enough to
bet on in Vegas

119
00:07:43,159 --> 00:07:48,979
okay so don't do it think it's one in
20,000

120
00:07:48,979 --> 00:07:53,969
actually gets pulled over and arrested I
wanted two thousand sorry chance getting

121
00:07:53,969 --> 00:07:54,789
pulled over

122
00:07:54,789 --> 00:07:58,020
22 percent chance of actually getting
arrested once you've been pulled over

123
00:07:58,020 --> 00:08:01,710
not let let's talk about alcohol every
drink you take

124
00:08:01,710 --> 00:08:05,450
whether it's a shot one ounce shot
whether it's a glass of wine I think

125
00:08:05,450 --> 00:08:06,800
it's six ounces for lost time

126
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:11,070
or appear about 12 ounces gives you the
same amount of alcohol I know you've

127
00:08:11,070 --> 00:08:13,880
seen the commercials they all have look
busy with this because this

128
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:17,219
this is bad if you have one drink to get
drunk

129
00:08:17,219 --> 00:08:20,580
probably not you might be I'm a
lightweight

130
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:24,560
alright sirs in a job I'm not small okay
trust me

131
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:28,020
not small and three drinks and I'm going
from

132
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:31,270
I need to sit down okay some people

133
00:08:31,270 --> 00:08:35,000
drink about a case and they're just fine

134
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:39,650
that's why they call a passing the bar

135
00:08:39,650 --> 00:08:42,909
up so everybody's different no women

136
00:08:42,909 --> 00:08:46,079
on the whole on average I should say a

137
00:08:46,079 --> 00:08:49,180
drink the same amount as Amanda same or
similar weight

138
00:08:49,180 --> 00:08:53,660
and they'll be more drunk okay it has to
do with the proportion of water and fat

139
00:08:53,660 --> 00:08:57,719
and everything else okay but basically a
woman has

140
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:01,650
three drinks a man has three drinks in
about the same height weight etcetera

141
00:09:01,650 --> 00:09:04,880
and the woman will be more effectively
drunk less capable

142
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:07,880
does that make sense and the

143
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:11,280
is that right wrong it's science sorry
dude is the way it is

144
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:15,339
okay so if a woman has five drinks in
your five drinks is a guy

145
00:09:15,339 --> 00:09:19,420
and you're both driving down the road
was gonna get pulled over well

146
00:09:19,420 --> 00:09:22,959
probably her sorry that's the way it is

147
00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:26,220
i apologize. there is an actual real
scientific gender gap

148
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:29,870
okay so that's the misconceptions

149
00:09:29,870 --> 00:09:36,079
that's the the legal ish over the limit
and everything else

150
00:09:36,079 --> 00:09:42,089
all my yellow socks

151
00:09:42,089 --> 00:09:44,949
the reason why we did it was that way I
knew when I was supposed to get up and

152
00:09:44,949 --> 00:09:46,120
talk

153
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:49,240
so how can a law enforcement officer
first step is

154
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:54,100
I I long for some officers out there
patrolling doing what they do

155
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:57,270
they see the driver white do they have
to

156
00:09:57,270 --> 00:10:00,300
what do they have to see our experience

157
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:05,209
that allows them to legally stop stop
the driver

158
00:10:05,209 --> 00:10:09,180
they have to have I'm they have to have

159
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:12,390
evidence as in visual evidence that

160
00:10:12,390 --> 00:10:16,250
sis witnesses or suspects a violation of
traffic laws

161
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:19,440
something as simple simple as at

162
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:22,949
inspection sticker that's invalid

163
00:10:22,949 --> 00:10:25,970
out-of-date registration a

164
00:10:25,970 --> 00:10:31,000
the a vehicle broken taillight

165
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,930
are something like I see evidence the
way this person's

166
00:10:34,930 --> 00:10:39,550
operating their car our vehicle sorry
vehicles important word

167
00:10:39,550 --> 00:10:44,990
in such a way that gives me a
articulable suspicion

168
00:10:44,990 --> 00:10:48,949
so I just have to be like I have to be
able to put in words based on that long

169
00:10:48,949 --> 00:10:51,329
that one person officers experience in
training

170
00:10:51,329 --> 00:10:54,959
that I believe that person

171
00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:58,589
is is violating the Criminal Code

172
00:10:58,589 --> 00:11:03,100
now are they can do a DUI or other
enforcement checkpoints

173
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:07,319
this is really interesting will not do
them at ok a few if you live on the east

174
00:11:07,319 --> 00:11:07,770
coast

175
00:11:07,770 --> 00:11:11,829
there are these things called holds if
you live in New Jersey

176
00:11:11,829 --> 00:11:15,140
their everywhere I'm sorry I grew up
there it's like oh

177
00:11:15,140 --> 00:11:18,360
damn lies and one in every corner are

178
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:21,780
yep moving to the committee you know
moving like that the South alike

179
00:11:21,780 --> 00:11:25,160
why do you have there's worth a toll
booth but I like

180
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:28,230
so they can picture the computer Cup
there's watchin' stop everyone just

181
00:11:28,230 --> 00:11:29,470
doing a quick I am

182
00:11:29,470 --> 00:11:32,760
NC what are you doing those are both

183
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:36,120
legal things that allow an officer

184
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:39,140
to stop the motorist

185
00:11:39,140 --> 00:11:42,610
if all motorists are stopped that's
lawful as well

186
00:11:42,610 --> 00:11:45,760
it has to be some kind of enforcement
checkpoint were checking to see

187
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:48,839
is your car stolen is they had my

188
00:11:48,839 --> 00:11:52,329
ob this happens a lot in now

189
00:11:52,329 --> 00:11:56,110
certain large motorcycle rallies where
they will check to see if you are

190
00:11:56,110 --> 00:11:57,890
compliant with the vehicle code

191
00:11:57,890 --> 00:12:01,110
I E is net muffler a little too loud

192
00:12:01,110 --> 00:12:04,959
they can stop everyone for that and
while the interacting with the

193
00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:09,780
with the operator to go them someone's a
little drunkie

194
00:12:09,780 --> 00:12:13,600
arm 10 Eve fading

195
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:18,329
a checkpoint as in you do something and
you violate the vehicle code

196
00:12:18,329 --> 00:12:22,530
to avoid the the checkpoint

197
00:12:22,530 --> 00:12:26,560
bet would be probable cause that you
were doing something wrong

198
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:30,270
avoiding it is not as an your on a grid

199
00:12:30,270 --> 00:12:34,670
streets and you make you know you make
the appropriate

200
00:12:34,670 --> 00:12:38,170
turns to go to the next block over and
go through that

201
00:12:38,170 --> 00:12:41,490
is avoiding a checkpoint not probable
cause

202
00:12:41,490 --> 00:12:45,040
if you do a u-turn and that is a legal
one that stayed

203
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:48,309
bad as probable cause that you've done
something wrong and they can turn around

204
00:12:48,309 --> 00:12:52,100
and stop you

205
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:57,220
now one quick note if the stop is a
legal

206
00:12:57,220 --> 00:13:00,410
if there's somehow we can prove that

207
00:13:00,410 --> 00:13:03,829
on defense counsel and I don't do that
work

208
00:13:03,829 --> 00:13:08,709
job but if defense counsel can argue
that

209
00:13:08,709 --> 00:13:12,410
the stop itself was unlawful there was
no actual

210
00:13:12,410 --> 00:13:15,480
I article suspicion to do the stop we
can

211
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:18,520
truck they can try to get all the
evidence subsequent had

212
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:22,150
kicked out against you for the boys
injury right

213
00:13:22,150 --> 00:13:25,660
yeah okay arm

214
00:13:25,660 --> 00:13:29,290
not about DW DWI history in laws

215
00:13:29,290 --> 00:13:34,380
arm the laws pertaining to UW why are
pressed down from the federal level

216
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:37,990
most states have their own laws but
there's standardize effectively in order

217
00:13:37,990 --> 00:13:38,549
to get

218
00:13:38,549 --> 00:13:42,400
federal highway funds

219
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:46,490
arm public notices extortion but Adams

220
00:13:46,490 --> 00:13:51,150
in San I'm many parents in new ones as I
can write the slide cuz I think the

221
00:13:51,150 --> 00:13:55,150
generally fairly similar art from
arresting officer must be able to

222
00:13:55,150 --> 00:13:57,199
identify the person operating

223
00:13:57,199 --> 00:14:00,870
and in control the vehicle it does not
require that they are

224
00:14:00,870 --> 00:14:04,900
in are operating the vehicle at that
time email have to identify

225
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:07,959
I have evidence that you

226
00:14:07,959 --> 00:14:11,829
were both intoxicated and operating a
vehicle and this can be something is

227
00:14:11,829 --> 00:14:13,559
somewhat simple as

228
00:14:13,559 --> 00:14:18,120
you're in the car you're drunk you have
the keys

229
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:22,390
that's enough evidence to show because
it does not be absolute from

230
00:14:22,390 --> 00:14:26,699
you know philosophical certainty has to
be to get conviction it has to be

231
00:14:26,699 --> 00:14:30,209
beyond a reasonable doubt well if you're
drunk passed out

232
00:14:30,209 --> 00:14:33,990
in the passenger seat of your car and
the keys in the ignition

233
00:14:33,990 --> 00:14:37,069
and your in a country road

234
00:14:37,069 --> 00:14:40,929
no one else in the car how to get there

235
00:14:40,929 --> 00:14:43,929
macular birth Immaculate Conception now

236
00:14:43,929 --> 00:14:47,689
Bigfoot drove my car there

237
00:14:47,689 --> 00:14:50,910
NY secede on the way to the front

238
00:14:50,910 --> 00:14:54,219
come on is it worth big flea okay

239
00:14:54,220 --> 00:14:57,329
on the blest so

240
00:14:57,329 --> 00:15:02,010
I read a buncha cases to figure this out
I practice in pennsylvania so I read

241
00:15:02,010 --> 00:15:05,120
Pennsylvania cases and the interesting
because the second 1a

242
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:10,150
vehicle arm reading stuff about
conveyance

243
00:15:10,150 --> 00:15:14,410
and other fermented amish in my in my in
the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania

244
00:15:14,410 --> 00:15:17,760
result some argument about is a

245
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:21,579
is a horse and buggy a vehicle for the

246
00:15:21,579 --> 00:15:24,870
purposes at the Pennsylvania vehicle
code and it turns out it is

247
00:15:24,870 --> 00:15:28,500
because it's some campaigns by which go
on the road but they're all these cases

248
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:30,520
where people tried to defend

249
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:34,949
that the I I was driving a train that's
not a vehicle

250
00:15:34,949 --> 00:15:39,110
and some poor schmuck some poor schmuck
law clerk at a church thing I gotta go

251
00:15:39,110 --> 00:15:39,900
argue this

252
00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:43,400
the and Raven 18-page opinion going well
it's got wheels

253
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:46,750
it moves someone has to operate it

254
00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:52,240
I'm really waiting for the subway one
mic operating a subway while drunk

255
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:56,439
it's actually happens I now in New York
City by the way it's actually happen

256
00:15:56,439 --> 00:15:59,179
there have been cases have somewhere
operators being drunk

257
00:15:59,179 --> 00:16:02,559
beat like transit police who are cops
real cops

258
00:16:02,559 --> 00:16:06,089
go you've got to be kidding me we break
like you know for

259
00:16:06,089 --> 00:16:09,660
into the station going grab the the
motor the motorman

260

261
00:16:12,929 --> 00:16:16,540

hell egos

262
00:16:16,540 --> 00:16:19,669
eyes not DWI

263
00:16:19,669 --> 00:16:22,980
and they had actually had to take on the
court besides the fact that call for

264
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:25,919
substitute motorman you know and can
imagine that radio call

265
00:16:25,919 --> 00:16:31,230
yeah I need a subdued motorman 0k yes go
to jail

266
00:16:31,230 --> 00:16:36,079
why he was drunk driving a subway car
with nine cars for 10 to 10 cars

267
00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:39,510
10 cars beloved 800 people

268
00:16:39,510 --> 00:16:45,850
what could go wrong and there's vomit in

269
00:16:45,850 --> 00:16:50,100
okay arm and they have to show the the
third thing after show is that you were

270
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:55,709
under the influence love a alcohol or
other drug

271
00:16:55,709 --> 00:16:59,059
law enforcement are but prosecution's
case has to prove

272
00:16:59,059 --> 00:17:02,240
all three points all three of these
elements of the crime

273
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:06,169
to get the conviction its

274
00:17:06,169 --> 00:17:09,549
the basement human a point system I'm
not sure why that's their

275
00:17:09,549 --> 00:17:13,168
sir who broke the slides I implied
consent

276
00:17:13,169 --> 00:17:16,799
there's another rule bad as a part of
the vehicle code

277
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:19,849
pretty much every state there is what we
call implied consent which is

278
00:17:19,849 --> 00:17:23,198
you consent to be tested when the
officer says

279
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:27,610
I wish to test you driver's license is a
privilege

280
00:17:27,610 --> 00:17:31,250
when you sign up for one you sign away
some rights

281
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:34,710
if you don't have a driver's license and
you're driving a car

282
00:17:34,710 --> 00:17:38,750
hectic so what they do is this you

283
00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:43,059
you are if they stop you you have the
right

284
00:17:43,059 --> 00:17:47,410
to turn down the test and we can
sanction you however it's not a criminal

285
00:17:47,410 --> 00:17:48,260
violation

286
00:17:48,260 --> 00:17:52,120
it is a civil violations you have no
rights but you won't go to jail

287
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:55,260
that this doesn't mean that if you're
hammered get more difficult on refusing

288
00:17:55,260 --> 00:17:56,049
the test

289
00:17:56,049 --> 00:17:59,780
they can convict me that would be
incorrect because

290
00:17:59,780 --> 00:18:05,510
they can use other evidence that says
y'all were messed up

291
00:18:05,510 --> 00:18:09,870
even without the test that has just
another piece of evidence

292
00:18:09,870 --> 00:18:13,120
you're slurring your words your dancing

293
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:16,280
you're doing whatever else you do when
your back drunk

294
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:20,879
acting like Alex on yen

295
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:27,880
love you to church

296
00:18:31,540 --> 00:18:38,540
Josh Europe

297
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:39,910
okay

298
00:18:39,910 --> 00:18:44,270
so let's talk about our Terms this is
pretty straight for this quick slide its

299
00:18:44,270 --> 00:18:45,480
cool is it good

300
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:49,780
it's a third presenter alright DUI DWI
driving while intoxicated

301
00:18:49,780 --> 00:18:55,960
just walk away nevermind driving under
the influence driving while intoxicated

302
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:58,580
we know what that means it doesn't mean
while drunk

303
00:18:58,580 --> 00:19:02,120
it means while under the influence of
something that impairs you make sense

304
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:06,590
go the the detection process is known as
the SFS tease

305
00:19:06,590 --> 00:19:09,980
the standard field sobriety tests are
standardized field sobriety testing

306
00:19:09,980 --> 00:19:13,810
preliminary breath test is the one they
give you onsite this is different from

307
00:19:13,810 --> 00:19:17,520
the one they give you at the jail
hospital the station the whatever

308
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:22,040
explain in a minute okay a blood alcohol
level blood alcohol concentration we

309
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:25,200
understand the AC member .8 or what
point one is where you go

310
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:29,050
for the guy I turn around by chance by
back click click let's go to hell

311
00:19:29,050 --> 00:19:34,120
lvl our breath breath from the deepest
part long as what they want lvl our

312
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:38,970
breath because that's where all that our
culture to circulate okay

313
00:19:38,970 --> 00:19:42,490
divided attention test can you pay
attention

314
00:19:42,490 --> 00:19:45,730
hi what's your name now count backwards
from 100

315
00:19:45,730 --> 00:19:49,510
by tens can you do that at the same time
and by the way what's the person on your

316
00:19:49,510 --> 00:19:50,550
left wearing

317
00:19:50,550 --> 00:19:54,590
you know t he fails and he isn't even
drunk or try different

318
00:19:54,590 --> 00:19:58,340
basically can you multitask

319
00:19:58,340 --> 00:20:01,459
okay we all have ADD were probably

320
00:20:01,460 --> 00:20:06,820
awesome that this re: HD NVG and
horizontal vertical gaze nystagmus

321
00:20:06,820 --> 00:20:10,600
follow my finger I got get into that
morning second

322
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:13,930
and the three phase detection process
will explain that as well as Zack

323
00:20:13,930 --> 00:20:17,430
so these are terms just two nomenclature
georgann

324
00:20:17,430 --> 00:20:20,750
so you get the idea okay so

325
00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:24,280
there's the three phase detection love
you drunk

326
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:28,210
okay one is the vehicle in motion not
what is a vehicle motion

327
00:20:28,210 --> 00:20:31,810
hopefully going down a straight line if
it's not a straight line

328
00:20:31,810 --> 00:20:35,500
that's a problem then there's the
personal contact the progress going in

329
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:36,570
the preliminary breath test

330
00:20:36,570 --> 00:20:40,830
so it's a three phase four phase will
nobody expects the Spanish Inquisition

331
00:20:40,830 --> 00:20:45,230
process this is the important part

332
00:20:45,230 --> 00:20:48,580
everything has to be standardized okay

333
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:51,870
as I go through the three phases

334
00:20:51,870 --> 00:20:55,920
love getting your arrested everything
has to be a standard process standard

335
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:56,600
procedure

336
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:59,490
as anybody here ever had to do that for
your data center for anything like that

337
00:20:59,490 --> 00:21:00,930
I so 27001

338
00:21:00,930 --> 00:21:04,460
and in like that right okay lot of
people

339
00:21:04,460 --> 00:21:07,810
understand the idea at least you have to
have a process and procedure you have to

340
00:21:07,810 --> 00:21:08,560
stick to it

341
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:12,440
if you don't there are penalties saw an
officer says

342
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:15,480
a.m. by the way Alex the lawyers it has
to be an articulable

343
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:19,160
reason to pull you over right okay I had
to be able to write

344
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:22,270
out arce out and the right out why I did
it

345
00:21:22,270 --> 00:21:25,389
and has to be the same every time I mean
it doesn't have to be ice on serb to the

346
00:21:25,390 --> 00:21:27,100
right and the left and the right and the
left

347
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:31,660
next case right then left now but every
time you have to give a very stable

348
00:21:31,660 --> 00:21:34,800
solid reasoned way what you did what you
did

349
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:37,880
and you have to follow a fairly solid
formula every time

350
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:42,080
so I followed vehicle X with license
plate why

351
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:45,570
SPDC he was swerving all over the road

352
00:21:45,570 --> 00:21:49,560
I determined this wasn't inappropriate
use of the roadway

353
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:54,399
and a potential violation of the driving
code therefore I pulled the vehicle over

354
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:58,250
for a license registration and insurance
check and to determine whether was a

355
00:21:58,250 --> 00:21:59,410
problem with the vehicle

356
00:21:59,410 --> 00:22:03,370
next case because the roughly similar
things you explain what they did

357
00:22:03,370 --> 00:22:06,620
but other than that it'll be pretty much
word-for-word it's a standardized

358
00:22:06,620 --> 00:22:07,160
formula

359
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:11,500
I walked up to the vehicle on the left
hand side the vehicle was

360
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:14,760
this color was this age was thus make
was this model

361
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:19,330
I determined this I saw this I saw the
open bottle of vodka in the passenger

362
00:22:19,330 --> 00:22:19,860
seat

363
00:22:19,860 --> 00:22:24,140
ice on leaning out the window puking I
small but comforting meters away

364
00:22:24,140 --> 00:22:27,470
I determined I probably was going to
have to perform the SSD's

365
00:22:27,470 --> 00:22:32,170
okay again when I was a cop there was a
very very simple maxam

366
00:22:32,170 --> 00:22:35,770
they said you can only be a cop in one
circumstance if you can write it

367
00:22:35,770 --> 00:22:39,490
if you can't write it don't fight it
okay

368
00:22:39,490 --> 00:22:42,300
don't get into a fight if you can't read
it out because if you can't write ups

369
00:22:42,300 --> 00:22:43,280
the weekend offender

370
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:48,510
you're gonna go to jails cow so they're
going to do things in a standardized

371
00:22:48,510 --> 00:22:49,260
fashion

372
00:22:49,260 --> 00:22:54,120
okay that's way and the reason for that
is because basically

373
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:57,830
you don't standardize it let's say I
rest these first three rows right here

374
00:22:57,830 --> 00:22:59,639
about 10 people are so

375
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:03,100
and I have report after report after
report after report after report after

376
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:04,200
report after report

377
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:07,310
at all in that nice formula the easy to
read

378
00:23:07,310 --> 00:23:10,379
there clearly articulated everything
works and then the

379
00:23:10,380 --> 00:23:14,030
10 person she's appear and she pissed me
off

380
00:23:14,030 --> 00:23:17,870
she just pissed me off I should have
done one behind you but that's okay

381
00:23:17,870 --> 00:23:21,840
she pissed me off and so I didn't even
bother with the SFS tease

382
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:27,050
I just slower in the back in the car cup
and took me to jail

383
00:23:27,050 --> 00:23:30,520
and her lawyers gonna go really

384
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:33,450
see the other reports you wrote that
week that month that border that year

385
00:23:33,450 --> 00:23:34,370
sure they are

386
00:23:34,370 --> 00:23:37,960
because that's part of discovery right
okay

387
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:41,260
and he's gonna say hey you follow this
procedure for him and him

388
00:23:41,260 --> 00:23:44,390
her and her and her and him in her and
him

389
00:23:44,390 --> 00:23:49,730
and you did the procedure her why was
there a personal bias

390
00:23:49,730 --> 00:23:53,020
sexism ageism people -ism

391
00:23:53,020 --> 00:23:56,980
because she's got a red hearses and yeah

392
00:23:56,980 --> 00:24:01,960
we all know those ginger purse people

393
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:06,040
I think we're gonna walk away from this
one way the judge is gonna go yeah

394
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:10,820
sorry dude adhere everything's gotta be
the same

395
00:24:10,820 --> 00:24:15,139
make sense everybody okay

396
00:24:15,140 --> 00:24:18,310
so preachers texan different nuances it
changes a bit

397
00:24:18,310 --> 00:24:21,889
changes if it changes a bit you know
we've told Woodson Jersey we are told

398
00:24:21,890 --> 00:24:24,920
in DC but you gotta tell or in the good
old

399
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:28,590
okay everything's different different
places but the idea is the same it's got

400
00:24:28,590 --> 00:24:29,530
to be consistent

401
00:24:29,530 --> 00:24:32,530
it's gonna be articulated article
articulable

402
00:24:32,530 --> 00:24:37,510
it's gotta be the same way every time
okay

403
00:24:37,510 --> 00:24:41,620
okay vehicle motion or through the
phases pulling you over and going

404
00:24:41,620 --> 00:24:45,290
paid jailed for what you've won tonight

405
00:24:45,290 --> 00:24:48,720
would you like left or door number one
unless in the cop car door number two on

406
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:49,560
the right side

407
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:53,379
those your only two choices okay so

408
00:24:53,380 --> 00:24:56,630
vehicle in motion visual cues appeared
operation

409
00:24:56,630 --> 00:25:00,580
he was swerving all over the road okay
with everywhere

410
00:25:00,580 --> 00:25:04,649
that's a visual cue recognition a
description official use

411
00:25:04,650 --> 00:25:08,070
I recognized it was swerving all over
the road okay

412
00:25:08,070 --> 00:25:12,370
again can you articulate it can you
write reinforcement of Use decision a

413
00:25:12,370 --> 00:25:13,200
star vehicle

414
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:16,460
I pulled up behind him put the lights
and sirens on any stills world all over

415
00:25:16,460 --> 00:25:17,500
the road

416
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:20,860
that's a reinforcement now if you're

417
00:25:20,860 --> 00:25:24,340
you know nervous in a cup coming up find
republicans light on the

418
00:25:24,340 --> 00:25:29,389
God that thats not gonna get your rest

419
00:25:29,390 --> 00:25:33,550
right lap with its gonna do is likely
over

420
00:25:33,550 --> 00:25:38,040
but that's not an arrest what is an
arrest when I can say is a cop pay

421
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:41,610
songs working I did this I did this
we're going to this and that

422
00:25:41,610 --> 00:25:45,720
second but in it additive process I'm
adding evidence to the pile

423
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:49,500
on the ballot this high a probable cause
on the market this high

424
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:53,570
you go to jail that make sense everybody
all the evidence really talk about right

425
00:25:53,570 --> 00:25:53,899
now is

426
00:25:53,900 --> 00:25:57,330
added latest at it's probably not a
legal term forgive me but

427
00:25:57,330 --> 00:26:00,470
it just keeps adding onto the pile okay
so the first phase

428
00:26:00,470 --> 00:26:04,200
I see a car actin funny and some former
fashion

429
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:07,410
one couple points there okay we're
adding to the pile

430
00:26:07,410 --> 00:26:12,720
next

431
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:16,510
we're gonna stop them is he gonna try
and fully

432
00:26:16,510 --> 00:26:21,150
because that'll be fun if he's not going
to sleep he's gonna pull over that's

433
00:26:21,150 --> 00:26:22,990
great that's a normal response

434
00:26:22,990 --> 00:26:27,500
if he pulls over 10 minutes later that's
not normal response

435
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:30,490
if it pulls over and the people's out
peoples over and pulls up old and I've

436
00:26:30,490 --> 00:26:31,950
seen it happen it's really weird

437
00:26:31,950 --> 00:26:35,340
like like would you make up your mind

438
00:26:35,340 --> 00:26:38,350
that's not a normal response adding to
the pile this is added

439
00:26:38,350 --> 00:26:42,140
is evidence one or more like a Rorschach
test was a normal response

440
00:26:42,140 --> 00:26:45,540
butterfly what's abnormal response monk
killing a cat

441
00:26:45,540 --> 00:26:48,940
with the Lee plated night

442
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:53,340
okay we'll talk

443
00:26:53,340 --> 00:26:57,970
these are all abnormal or the get Israel
abnormal right here

444
00:26:57,970 --> 00:27:03,330
everything's been reported where is it
being recorded anybody have an idea

445
00:27:03,330 --> 00:27:06,699
what in the your

446
00:27:06,700 --> 00:27:10,000
you can

447
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:13,900
okay is right it's is being recorded by
dash camera video camera in the cop car

448
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:16,419
these are many many different models in
the old days there was literally

449
00:27:16,419 --> 00:27:18,179
freaking VHS

450
00:27:18,179 --> 00:27:21,210
camcorder turned upside down bolted the
tripod

451
00:27:21,210 --> 00:27:25,110
public outdoor annual like upset like
bandages your permit lino

452
00:27:25,110 --> 00:27:28,780
Hall okay they've gotten tiny

453
00:27:28,780 --> 00:27:32,230
if you haven't seen hidden cameras
they're amazing and the use them in cop

454
00:27:32,230 --> 00:27:32,669
cars

455
00:27:32,669 --> 00:27:36,710
ominous these limits for you that the
dash cameras are

456
00:27:36,710 --> 00:27:40,409
this big now like literally just hines
ridiculous

457
00:27:40,409 --> 00:27:45,890
okay and the record some other record
the entire shift

458
00:27:45,890 --> 00:27:49,290
some the record lay off the coke

they ready they went to the front to
police barracks

630

because that's what he requested he's in
there and

632
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:18,920
they're like 3 hauling away alright walk
in turn

633
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:22,369
no problem recite the alphabet backwards
in cling on

634
00:38:22,369 --> 00:38:25,520
no problem you know do this do that no
problem

635
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:29,410
horizontal gaze nystagmus the only
physiological test that's what you up

636
00:38:29,410 --> 00:38:32,618
kinda cool okay so the to test the one
let's dance

637
00:38:32,619 --> 00:38:35,720
and the walk in turn are just attention
tests

638
00:38:35,720 --> 00:38:40,119
track can you follow instructions can
you do the right things at the right

639
00:38:40,119 --> 00:38:40,859
time can you

640
00:38:40,859 --> 00:38:44,578
focus okay make sense the horizontal
gaze nystagmus

641
00:38:44,579 --> 00:38:49,029
I'm not my finger 12 inches from your
eyes follow my finger with your eyes

642
00:38:49,029 --> 00:38:52,089
he's gonna go slowly this way Swansea

643
00:38:52,089 --> 00:38:55,450
your customers in this is not to screw
up and he's gonna go to your limits your

644
00:38:55,450 --> 00:38:56,359
peripheral vision

645
00:38:56,359 --> 00:38:59,680
you know that a little too far up okay

646
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:03,509
and is okay hang on go back to limited
your peripheral vision is gonna hold it

647
00:39:03,510 --> 00:39:04,079
there

648
00:39:04,079 --> 00:39:08,119
and after about 15 seconds eyes just
mister

649
00:39:08,119 --> 00:39:11,450
quivering because when you're drunk your
muscles are not right

650
00:39:11,450 --> 00:39:16,200
sirs will not right they start quivering
edges when they're under strain visit

651
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:20,230
at the edges ever prefer a vision there
Frank all the way over right okay

652
00:39:20,230 --> 00:39:23,680
and it's a quiver that said

653
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:28,578
added evidence have a nice day that a
conclusive hit by the way

654
00:39:28,579 --> 00:39:31,630
okay at that point the hi love evidence

655
00:39:31,630 --> 00:39:35,339
you were swerving you have you sound
wrong

656
00:39:35,339 --> 00:39:39,460
slurring your speech uses reach a vodka

657
00:39:39,460 --> 00:39:43,470
gin doesn't smell you read your vodka

658
00:39:43,470 --> 00:39:48,490
you cannot perform a horizontal gaze
nystagmus test correctly

659
00:39:48,490 --> 00:39:51,849
and when I didn't have to do the walk in
turn reciting the alphabet backwards and

660
00:39:51,849 --> 00:39:52,619
going on

661
00:39:52,619 --> 00:39:55,829
you didn't know the olive character

662
00:39:55,829 --> 00:39:59,920
so now we've established probable cause
that we can our rec what the law

663
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:01,180
enforcement officer can

664
00:40:01,180 --> 00:40:06,000
rescue okay so these tests are pretty
straightforward explain the walk in turn

665
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,890
explain the horizontal gaze nystagmus

666
00:40:07,890 --> 00:40:14,670
the one that gets dances really top
watching to do right now

667
00:40:14,670 --> 00:40:18,750
if you didn't catch that extreme version

668
00:40:18,750 --> 00:40:22,319
stand on one for you like that but wall

669
00:40:22,319 --> 00:40:25,910
was an email for wall counting my
sixteens wall

670
00:40:25,910 --> 00:40:29,190
doing these things get can you multitask
can you track and you focus

671
00:40:29,190 --> 00:40:32,950
I know harping on this but it's the
biggest thing

672
00:40:32,950 --> 00:40:37,160
okay so we've got three test battery do
all these things

673
00:40:37,160 --> 00:40:40,899
don't start for the test is likely to do
so here's I'm gonna do a test

674
00:40:40,900 --> 00:40:44,020
watch this is not drunk does it all
right sir please don't perform any

675
00:40:44,020 --> 00:40:47,040
this until I finish instructing you on
how to do this right

676
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:50,299
a high I'm gonna want you know stand on

677
00:40:50,299 --> 00:40:54,440
1 like and then recite the alphabet at

678
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:59,950
I sir please stop until I finish
instructing you

679
00:40:59,950 --> 00:41:05,589
home okay I don't say simon says

680
00:41:05,589 --> 00:41:09,299
bastard had my training of had to me

681
00:41:09,299 --> 00:41:12,809
we did Simon Says three hours 18 that
bastard Simon

682
00:41:12,809 --> 00:41:16,430
alright so horizontal gaze nystagmus

683
00:41:16,430 --> 00:41:19,578
involuntary jerking the eyes we talked
about that the I tremors

684
00:41:19,579 --> 00:41:23,029
look you're actually our medical
conditions that will cause this so

685
00:41:23,029 --> 00:41:27,240
if you have one tell the officer because
they will jail you if you don't tell 'em

686
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:30,260
right I'm not gonna list the medical
conditions really don't want them in a

687
00:41:30,260 --> 00:41:31,720
minute to go blind

688
00:41:31,720 --> 00:41:35,200
okay our man I'll get like something

689
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:39,319
block or something and I mean is that
was like a drink and drive whenever

690
00:41:39,319 --> 00:41:42,390
you'll be blind you'll be driving much
more okay so

691
00:41:42,390 --> 00:41:47,089
don't do it

692
00:41:47,089 --> 00:41:52,210
alright the preliminary breath test hang
on

693
00:41:52,210 --> 00:41:55,619
shit not good the preliminary breath
test

694
00:41:55,619 --> 00:41:59,210
on-site I've got probable cause right
I'm gonna give you a breathalyzer test

695
00:41:59,210 --> 00:42:00,210
on-site

696
00:42:00,210 --> 00:42:03,240
how does the breathalyzer test work this
the technical stuff alright

697
00:42:03,240 --> 00:42:07,210
it's not admissible in most states
actually I think all

698
00:42:07,210 --> 00:42:10,319
and the reason being and I'll explain
that the technical bit is because it's

699
00:42:10,319 --> 00:42:10,849
not

700
00:42:10,849 --> 00:42:14,779
precise this is a piece of evidence yes
but it's just really to cover the

701
00:42:14,779 --> 00:42:15,920
officers ass

702
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:19,380
its debt probable cause for arrest is
not admissible and core

703
00:42:19,380 --> 00:42:22,680
to get conviction right this covers the
the officers asked

704
00:42:22,680 --> 00:42:26,078
help to bring him in to you see people
on the breathalyzer

705
00:42:26,079 --> 00:42:29,480
yes but was a hundred and fifty percent
humidity and it was you know

706
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:33,410
112 degrees out Sox okay why would

707
00:42:33,410 --> 00:42:38,828
that matter because

708
00:42:38,829 --> 00:42:42,529
I'll you got to get okay to the urban
legends now

709
00:42:42,529 --> 00:42:45,990
that slide but OK don't put a penny in
your time

710
00:42:45,990 --> 00:42:50,099
don't swap alcohol into your mouth just
before the breathalyzer

711
00:42:50,099 --> 00:42:53,849
don't like sticky tips up your nose
swear to god I've heard

712
00:42:53,849 --> 00:42:58,009
if you have to watch 'em episode of
Mythbusters not that it's a bad thing

713
00:42:58,009 --> 00:43:01,920
awesomely dudes but watch the one with
the test at the DUI test

714
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:06,130
Adam Savage is so freakin funny went
wrong its larious

715
00:43:06,130 --> 00:43:09,259
his ended like you know fifteen years
later in like a penny and you're talking

716
00:43:09,259 --> 00:43:10,859
like giving our

717
00:43:10,859 --> 00:43:14,819
is the Corolla pennies under is Tyler
the

718
00:43:14,820 --> 00:43:18,240
half and a

719
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:22,300
the blows really friggin drunk I think
it was swallowed a penny like pounding

720
00:43:22,300 --> 00:43:23,160
on the back

721
00:43:23,160 --> 00:43:26,578
you know don't hola hey I got a crap

722
00:43:26,579 --> 00:43:29,920
copper so anyway arm

723
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:33,770
don't built in the breathalyzer don't
use ments mincer on we all like means

724
00:43:33,770 --> 00:43:34,530
but don't do it

725
00:43:34,530 --> 00:43:37,430
look if you get to the point where
they're at the station using the

726
00:43:37,430 --> 00:43:38,560
Intoxilyzer

727
00:43:38,560 --> 00:43:42,720
when I was a cop with the breathalyzer
the on-site an Intoxilyzer which is the

728
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:45,050
calibrated one at the jail we had it
there

729
00:43:45,050 --> 00:43:48,900
someplace like a different places but
%uh the main station the Intoxilyzer

730
00:43:48,900 --> 00:43:52,740
you cannot for with that thing i mean
there are ways but kinda abnormal

731
00:43:52,740 --> 00:43:57,619
do that arm ice actually kinda works 12
seconds because it cools the air down

732
00:43:57,619 --> 00:44:01,510
but like I'm about to take an
Intoxilyzer test mind if I stop my

733
00:44:01,510 --> 00:44:02,630

736
00:44:10,859 --> 00:44:14,150
you take now which okay so

737
00:44:14,150 --> 00:44:21,150

to go to court for

762
00:45:48,170 --> 00:45:53,680
its socks because Norwich on the day of
the pay 25 for 50 bucks depending on the

763
00:45:53,680 --> 00:45:54,509
state to go to court

764
00:45:54,510 --> 00:45:58,280
so on your day off I want you to show up
at court uniformity

765
00:45:58,280 --> 00:46:02,530
hot as hell wearing gone and you're
getting paid 50 bucks for that day to go

766
00:46:02,530 --> 00:46:05,060
sit in court and answer questions from
an idiot lawyer

767
00:46:05,060 --> 00:46:08,240
who wants to do that

768
00:46:08,240 --> 00:46:12,569
okay so

769
00:46:12,569 --> 00:46:16,770
arm if they can give you something they
don't the court for you like arms

770
00:46:16,770 --> 00:46:20,530
to pay this sometimes life is good you
never know but anyway

771
00:46:20,530 --> 00:46:24,450
skip this

772
00:46:24,450 --> 00:46:27,510
the test is on par the test area

773
00:46:27,510 --> 00:46:30,609
okay DC that that's weird when a
breathalyzer

774
00:46:30,609 --> 00:46:35,029
no job they're not heart what is a
breathalyzer do

775
00:46:35,030 --> 00:46:38,470
it takes your breath it pushes it across
to contacts

776
00:46:38,470 --> 00:46:42,069
the more conductive your breath is the
more alcohol there is in your bro

777
00:46:42,069 --> 00:46:45,849
simple seriously so what's going on fact
that

778
00:46:45,849 --> 00:46:49,790
temperature humidity why well it's humid

779
00:46:49,790 --> 00:46:53,069
its gonna dilute your the out hole in
your breath its gonna change the

780
00:46:53,069 --> 00:46:55,550
connectivity of the contact gonna be
cold water

781
00:46:55,550 --> 00:46:59,130
up okay if it's cold your

782
00:46:59,130 --> 00:47:02,270
the alcohol a prize correctly okay
because the breathalyzer the better

783
00:47:02,270 --> 00:47:03,740
models actually heats up your

784
00:47:03,740 --> 00:47:07,210
your breath to vaporize the alcohol more
effectively so get such

785
00:47:07,210 --> 00:47:11,230
reading about about holding your breath
so think you would like a lie detector

786
00:47:11,230 --> 00:47:14,560
anybody's afraid to take a lie detector
and they put the the the

787
00:47:14,560 --> 00:47:19,310
every in everything on you want things
the reading the galvanic skin response

788
00:47:19,310 --> 00:47:22,650
really how conductive your skin is when
you lines little

789
00:47:22,650 --> 00:47:26,430
okay just a little bit you know not like
I'm sweating down these freakin lights

790
00:47:26,430 --> 00:47:31,549
but a little bit and when you're drawn
is more alcohol in your breath and it

791
00:47:31,550 --> 00:47:32,230
makes the

792
00:47:32,230 --> 00:47:35,490
wanted a prize is it creates more
conductive cloud there the more

793
00:47:35,490 --> 00:47:36,000
electricity

794
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:40,690
across more drunk you are and it's
calibrated against the reference sample

795
00:47:40,690 --> 00:47:44,099
at the Intoxilyzer is not the right
let's remember on-site in the station

796
00:47:44,099 --> 00:47:44,490
right

797
00:47:44,490 --> 00:47:48,380
it's calibrated and it's calibrated
correctly

798
00:47:48,380 --> 00:47:51,460
humidity control temperature controlled
environment and they don't you have a

799
00:47:51,460 --> 00:47:54,990
class belies ok before you get on got
there blowing it

800
00:47:54,990 --> 00:47:58,210
you be conclusive test right there

801
00:47:58,210 --> 00:48:01,950
that conclusive by the way members at
the breathalyzer on site no good

802
00:48:01,950 --> 00:48:05,310
Intoxilyzer real admissible in court
right

803
00:48:05,310 --> 00:48:09,540
yep okay so can you make one of these

804
00:48:09,540 --> 00:48:12,980
yes do I suggest you do yes kinda cool

805
00:48:12,980 --> 00:48:16,300
it's really great sensing platform you
can sense how much alcohol how much

806
00:48:16,300 --> 00:48:16,910
conductive

807
00:48:16,910 --> 00:48:20,980
across a couple sensors tonight we know
integrated with a project have fun

808
00:48:20,980 --> 00:48:25,250
buddy mindell one smart guy nose is
crappy built one

809
00:48:25,250 --> 00:48:28,280
that's it and it works in

810
00:48:28,280 --> 00:48:33,420
his way used on bicycling but anyway

811
00:48:33,420 --> 00:48:39,270
okay this is yours

812
00:48:39,270 --> 00:48:43,730
right side arm there's one interesting
wrinkle I'm going to talk about the

813
00:48:43,730 --> 00:48:44,510
Intoxilyzer

814
00:48:44,510 --> 00:48:47,790
this is the in either the

815
00:48:47,790 --> 00:48:51,580
in station calibrated actual evidential
value

816
00:48:51,580 --> 00:48:55,000
breath test by which you can get
convicted we've made

817
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:59,369
officers decided I enough I have
sufficient probable cause after the SST

818
00:48:59,369 --> 00:49:02,880
are the roadside breath test are just

819
00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:06,030
your %um by my impression you're
hammered

820
00:49:06,030 --> 00:49:09,130
come on down bill they will now

821
00:49:09,130 --> 00:49:13,720
has to do with the calibrated more
expensive machine

822
00:49:13,720 --> 00:49:17,790
this is a sensor with some circuitry

823
00:49:17,790 --> 00:49:21,420
and as we all know circuitry a software

824
00:49:21,420 --> 00:49:25,890
and the most the state's laws

825
00:49:25,890 --> 00:49:29,710
use I the NH hearsay national highway
transit

826
00:49:29,710 --> 00:49:33,050
Transportation Safety something stations
a

827
00:49:33,050 --> 00:49:36,160
administration arm I know should
remember that

828
00:49:36,160 --> 00:49:40,270
they promulgate a list that says these
are the approved models

829
00:49:40,270 --> 00:49:44,160
makes and models love the im you
evidentiary

830
00:49:44,160 --> 00:49:48,060
valuable boxes you can do these tests

831
00:49:48,060 --> 00:49:51,140
the problem is that when you actually
poor born it just has

832
00:49:51,140 --> 00:49:54,230
make and model there's an additional
variable

833
00:49:54,230 --> 00:49:58,260
which is what version for where is it

834
00:49:58,260 --> 00:50:01,609
and as we all know they modify the
firmware to

835
00:50:01,609 --> 00:50:05,130
for whatever reason a few smart

836
00:50:05,130 --> 00:50:08,260
DUI were selected and said wait a minute
could the

837
00:50:08,260 --> 00:50:12,010
different software version me there's a
difference in accuracy

838
00:50:12,010 --> 00:50:15,020
why to change software manufacture

839
00:50:15,020 --> 00:50:19,849
and the couple cases these became kinda
I little fights between

840
00:50:19,849 --> 00:50:23,400
prosecutors are trying to promulgate you
try to use this evidence

841
00:50:23,400 --> 00:50:26,609
the defense counsel China kill it in the
manufacture because the

842
00:50:26,609 --> 00:50:30,420
the defense counsel goes says

843
00:50:30,420 --> 00:50:36,220
I don't think that the Intoxilyzer you
used is actually certified

844
00:50:36,220 --> 00:50:39,650
defense count I'm in past years ago its
make and model Mike yeah

845
00:50:39,650 --> 00:50:44,430
but it changed NH TSA which sell for
version did you use

846
00:50:44,430 --> 00:50:47,470
we don't have those records manufacture

847
00:50:47,470 --> 00:50:51,589
which software version was on the box
you gave to the image you see for

848
00:50:51,589 --> 00:50:52,319
testing

849
00:50:52,319 --> 00:50:55,500
an HD and they say we didn't send any NH

850
00:50:55,500 --> 00:50:59,910
use a bottom of the market so it's a
possible

851
00:50:59,910 --> 00:51:02,950
bat this mission machine used is now

852
00:51:02,950 --> 00:51:07,710
mission that's accurate mmm can answer
that because we don't know what version

853
00:51:07,710 --> 00:51:08,609
the software

854
00:51:08,609 --> 00:51:12,420
so there a couple cases where defense
council decided

855
00:51:12,420 --> 00:51:15,680
we're going to pursue this really really
hard

856
00:51:15,680 --> 00:51:19,599
we're going to demand the source code

857
00:51:19,599 --> 00:51:22,700
and manufactures like we why do we have
to show the source code

858
00:51:22,700 --> 00:51:26,049
but that's our proprietary magical stuff
because it's really hard to rate the

859
00:51:26,049 --> 00:51:26,880
software

860
00:51:26,880 --> 00:51:31,540
and we don't want but we're freedoms
were free that goes to our competitors

861
00:51:31,540 --> 00:51:35,869
and they'll figure out the magic juju so

862
00:51:35,869 --> 00:51:39,470
they they kinda they were like no we not
we don't have to give you

863
00:51:39,470 --> 00:51:43,280
we don't have to give you this evidence
and some courts

864
00:51:43,280 --> 00:51:46,700
some some state Supreme Court said well

865
00:51:46,700 --> 00:51:49,980
really you have to show you can trust
him and the source code

866
00:51:49,980 --> 00:51:54,119
just cause have to show that there is
some other outside evidence

867
00:51:54,119 --> 00:51:58,940
that the box is inaccurate enough that
you have a false positive

868
00:51:58,940 --> 00:52:03,670
there other states that have just said
sure the defense counsel defense can get

869
00:52:03,670 --> 00:52:04,210
whatever

870
00:52:04,210 --> 00:52:07,410
great reasonable discover they're
supposed to get

871
00:52:07,410 --> 00:52:11,569
earth-shaking attorney the ob

872
00:52:11,569 --> 00:52:15,730
so Cup its its kinda split I've noticed
this the the way

873
00:52:15,730 --> 00:52:19,000
the laws practiced is one attorney

874
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:23,510
will actually splashing client will find
a high and attorney who was willing to

875
00:52:23,510 --> 00:52:24,150
go

876
00:52:24,150 --> 00:52:28,130
and have someone to a forensic code
review want these boxes for

877
00:52:28,130 --> 00:52:31,770
a bitch million dollars and

878
00:52:31,770 --> 00:52:35,910
yeah I got this guy of those you know
hundred and ten thousand dollar DUI case

879
00:52:35,910 --> 00:52:36,960
for someone rather well

880
00:52:36,960 --> 00:52:40,910
be but then every

881
00:52:40,910 --> 00:52:46,180
I'll take any lawsuit for $99.95 a rush
job esquire

882
00:52:46,180 --> 00:52:50,490
will say wait a minute I don't actually
have to do a code review I just have to

883
00:52:50,490 --> 00:52:51,460
file a motion

884
00:52:51,460 --> 00:52:55,140
demanded and the prosecutors gonna say
essential

885
00:52:55,140 --> 00:52:59,460
freakin work is there something we keep

886
00:52:59,460 --> 00:53:02,750
knobs usual you can't believe these
cases in

887
00:53:02,750 --> 00:53:06,250
in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania
there are very few diverging paths

888
00:53:06,250 --> 00:53:10,210
out-of-date eu-wide they're like usually
for most practitioners as

889
00:53:10,210 --> 00:53:14,190
you're banging these cases hell I had a
friend on a public defender who drove a

890
00:53:14,190 --> 00:53:15,060
Porsche

891
00:53:15,060 --> 00:53:18,349
and how do you get to drive a Porsche is
a public defenders ago I

892
00:53:18,349 --> 00:53:21,920
I'm allowed to practice on this as per
my contract and she would do

893
00:53:21,920 --> 00:53:26,339
DUI defense is at 1500 bucks a pop and
she would do

894
00:53:26,339 --> 00:53:29,640
15 to 20 week and

895
00:53:29,640 --> 00:53:34,250
there's the same as we will play it was
the same like because most DUI defense

896
00:53:34,250 --> 00:53:38,010
are different then regular criminal
defense most criminal defendants

897
00:53:38,010 --> 00:53:41,290
are multiple offenders were arm

898
00:53:41,290 --> 00:53:47,980
experience from offense

899
00:53:47,980 --> 00:53:51,140
ob most DUI offenders

900
00:53:51,140 --> 00:53:55,460
when they get arrested or this is the
first time I've ever seen jail

901
00:53:55,460 --> 00:53:58,700
I'm scared I need to lawyer

902
00:53:58,700 --> 00:54:02,069
I need to spend a lot of money in a
lawyer's I'm really freed what's going

903
00:54:02,069 --> 00:54:02,990
to happen and

904
00:54:02,990 --> 00:54:06,010
we will are not hi but people

905
00:54:06,010 --> 00:54:09,040
practices people of New little bit if I
can go well

906
00:54:09,040 --> 00:54:12,569
if your free times important to you
maybe you should pay the top box for the

907
00:54:12,569 --> 00:54:13,859
best deal I've attorney

908
00:54:13,859 --> 00:54:18,180
now there I happen to be that 90's and

909
00:54:18,180 --> 00:54:22,460
and you in realizes I mean I get I've II
worked as a public defender for a little

910
00:54:22,460 --> 00:54:22,839
while

911
00:54:22,839 --> 00:54:26,859
I get that your you get we can actually
white-collar persons

912
00:54:26,859 --> 00:54:30,660
his their imagine like you know it

913
00:54:30,660 --> 00:54:35,390
