1
00:00:00,659 --> 00:00:04,630

developer for the Electronic Frontier

2
00:00:04,630 --> 00:00:05,839

this is my second time to help a I want
to

5
00:00:13,700 --> 00:00:16,869
the last hope but an American actor
armor

6
00:00:16,869 --> 00:00:20,340
and I was so excited about hope that
there that I i

7
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:24,769
was looking at the schedule the other
day and I called up go a long way

8
00:00:24,769 --> 00:00:28,439
hey I've been looking at the Hope
schedule and Google is likely I we now

9
00:00:28,439 --> 00:00:33,020
and I call up Twitter into the same
thing and I like oh yeah

10
00:00:33,020 --> 00:00:37,160
we know we saw you look at it hope
schedule on hope number nine done that

11
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:37,680
and

12
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:43,129
how do you like Ubuntu by the way so

13
00:00:43,129 --> 00:00:46,280
a the reason that hope that going
Twitter

14
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:49,719
know they're looking at the homestead or
is because a

15
00:00:49,719 --> 00:00:53,250
hope number nine da nang crews a
javascript file

16
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:58,109
from Google Analytics and also Google
Web Fonts

17
00:00:58,109 --> 00:01:01,739
and they have twitter backgrounds on the
website that

18
00:01:01,739 --> 00:01:04,799
include scraps from when you first

19
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:09,189
load the website and so here it is you
know a random sampling of some

20
00:01:09,189 --> 00:01:12,490
kinda back to the store and website also
give

21
00:01:12,490 --> 00:01:16,490
visitor data to third and here's what's
the what their

22
00:01:16,490 --> 00:01:19,560
already there and chapters are a lot of
these

23
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:22,750
people who operated what they've don't
even realize

24
00:01:22,750 --> 00:01:27,830
that's going on so

25
00:01:27,830 --> 00:01:31,530
mama what be there are they giving to
like what data

26
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:35,409
what what your day tag goes to go in
Twitter when you visit hope number nine

27
00:01:35,409 --> 00:01:35,900
on that

28
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:39,560
arm you make an HTTP request

29
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:44,079
and the there's a lot of information is
a shitty aircraft that depends on

30
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:44,810
whether or not

31
00:01:44,810 --> 00:01:48,329
you have a cookies on your browser for
their services in a

32
00:01:48,329 --> 00:01:51,500
but on this information is your web
browser

33
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:55,880
operating system on language setting
viagra for

34
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:59,780
throwing is is where you came from so if
you look at Twitter's logs

35
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:04,549
you could the last I everyone has been
visiting

36
00:02:04,549 --> 00:02:07,770
hopes website Obama and

37
00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:11,470
obviously right here at what time you
want their on it

38
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:16,349
JavaScript JavaScript is able to get
more information about you

39
00:02:16,349 --> 00:02:19,519
in the rather like what plugin I'll and

40
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:22,560
so every time out your website

41
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:26,040
or any resource on Wednesday or any ajax
request

42
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:32,560
all this information your that to their
are men so here's some example the

43
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:33,459
things that I

44
00:02:33,459 --> 00:02:36,500
include their party's earth arm

45
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:40,760
and it's more than just that it's like
like anytime you in bed anyways it

46
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:43,000
pretty much about that specifically
designed

47
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:47,360
to you be private the family it
privately on Bramley arm

48
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:51,569
and so I'm gonna talk about ways to get
around this

49
00:02:51,569 --> 00:02:57,580
and not give better data to their
burgers comment so here's some web sites

50
00:02:57,580 --> 00:02:58,440
that are

51
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:02,579
separately I like try to be specifically
privately friendly

52
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:07,159
that don't include any ready gaps armagh
and they did this on purpose so that

53
00:03:07,159 --> 00:03:08,609
when you have the right up da net

54
00:03:08,610 --> 00:03:11,769
I nobody else knows everything driver

55
00:03:11,769 --> 00:03:15,340
you like your visit to rival done that
doesn't appear in any one of a blog

56
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:19,370
and yes of is launching a new privacy
policy then

57
00:03:19,370 --> 00:03:23,620
and this is from a I'm we're gonna
promised to not include any third

58
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:24,310
parties are

59
00:03:24,310 --> 00:03:27,970
initially the page without giving you
their you there champ top 10

60
00:03:27,970 --> 00:03:32,060
and I I'm gonna show how you can

61
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:37,299
gives you the chance to opt into that
they're pretty arm

62
00:03:37,299 --> 00:03:40,459
so why a does it really matter

63
00:03:40,459 --> 00:03:43,750
if a there's giant databases

64
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:47,129
everyone user agents and bangs arm

65
00:03:47,129 --> 00:03:50,750
so it's really surprising how few

66
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:55,330
I like how little amount of information
you needed to uniquely identify

67
00:03:55,330 --> 00:03:59,269
anyone in the world arm how many people
live in

68
00:03:59,269 --> 00:04:02,909
Manhattan 11 million people man

69
00:04:02,909 --> 00:04:06,060
so I'd say that their investigators
trying to figure out who want to

70
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:06,840
destabilize

71
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:10,430
Obama and they have a web server logs
and

72
00:04:10,430 --> 00:04:14,310
they the to tell them the user-agent
this person uses

73
00:04:14,310 --> 00:04:18,130
the door a Linux so like out 11 million
people

74
00:04:18,130 --> 00:04:21,738
how many believe the door to you

75
00:04:21,739 --> 00:04:26,090
there yeah let's pretend two hundred

76
00:04:26,090 --> 00:04:29,130
and Alex say that their language is
French

77
00:04:29,130 --> 00:04:32,990
like how many people speak France or
have their language on their property

78
00:04:32,990 --> 00:04:33,500
that

79
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:37,590
French and you to relax like maybe one
or two and

80
00:04:37,590 --> 00:04:42,580
in hanoi so it only takes a little bit
information to build a

81
00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:47,289
a brother fingerprint and there's a lot
more information than just like the user

82
00:04:47,290 --> 00:04:48,120
agent string

83
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:51,220
I and the Latin language settings and
stuff like

84
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:54,380
if you're using you know a netbook you
have

85
00:04:54,380 --> 00:04:58,100
like a specific revolution you have I

86
00:04:58,100 --> 00:05:01,150
you know may be running on ARM processor
and

87
00:05:01,150 --> 00:05:04,630
by you might have very plugins in your
browser that

88
00:05:04,630 --> 00:05:07,960
JavaScript and attacked and stuff and so

89
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:11,539
even if you catch up tonight draft
uniquely identify somebody wake

90
00:05:11,539 --> 00:05:14,740
like but the IP addresses from a coffee
shop somewhere

91
00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:18,190
you can build it unique fingerprint them
from their

92
00:05:18,190 --> 00:05:23,370
web browser are men so the big thing is
that their parties can do it at that

93
00:05:23,370 --> 00:05:27,910
law get Obama and use it to track

94
00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:31,620
and the most people

95
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:36,110
log everything for a long time and that
means that

96
00:05:36,110 --> 00:05:39,780
you know these logs to get subpoenaed
comment last night I went to the

97
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:40,840
WikiLeaks stock

98
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:44,300
ACLU lawyers and that they were talking
about with the

99
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:48,000
WikiLeaks investigation this is exactly
what law enforcement is doing

100
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,289
they're like subpoenaing all of these
services for

101
00:05:52,289 --> 00:05:57,060
information about visitors and you know
Twitter could totally give

102
00:05:57,060 --> 00:06:01,300
long fourth man OS all their logs with
surfers from

103
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:04,889
number nine down and try and build you
know

104
00:06:04,889 --> 00:06:10,080
a pretty good idea of who is coming to
this conference from a

105
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:13,240
so the my first check is about

106
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:16,860
Google Web Fonts arm so it's pretty
awesome

107
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:21,560
the CFS finally works one of the two
have any part you want

108
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:24,669
and now website they're finally stopped
by

109
00:06:24,669 --> 00:06:27,799
grady no more like time they remember
donna

110
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:31,110
and iraq you will have to soften service

111
00:06:31,110 --> 00:06:35,210
the web fire pot the Tory and all the
popular open source and you could

112
00:06:35,210 --> 00:06:38,490
go put in your tax in with your bond
find the ones you want and then

113
00:06:38,490 --> 00:06:41,889
embed it in your website arm and so

114
00:06:41,889 --> 00:06:45,979
itself at this code your website and so
what happens if you had occurred your

115
00:06:45,979 --> 00:06:47,349
website as

116
00:06:47,350 --> 00:06:51,050
I want someone lose your website will
make a request to bonds active lately

117
00:06:51,050 --> 00:06:52,380
I've dot com

118
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:55,819
and so that's already Google getting

119
00:06:55,819 --> 00:07:00,470
data about someone visited your website
Obama and then also

120
00:07:00,470 --> 00:07:03,729
inside of the the

121
00:07:03,729 --> 00:07:07,169
inside of the above file it makes
another request to the actual

122
00:07:07,169 --> 00:07:10,669
on file but it's really easy to use
these last month

123
00:07:10,669 --> 00:07:13,810
without actually sending a request to
Google all you have to do is download

124
00:07:13,810 --> 00:07:15,430
the flow of bile

125
00:07:15,430 --> 00:07:18,930
and then just copy this but in your own
Jeff file

126
00:07:18,930 --> 00:07:22,449
and Mike to your own life i'll know what
people are your website

127
00:07:22,449 --> 00:07:28,419
I just got here and there

128
00:07:28,419 --> 00:07:32,799
yet well so arm early the part that I
love to admire a federal agent is what

129
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:33,720
it looks like they're all

130
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:36,819
I like organized which means you know
you can redistribute them

131
00:07:36,819 --> 00:07:41,630
whatever

132
00:07:41,630 --> 00:07:44,800
Obama I'm not sure are

133
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:48,610
I mean I don't think it's much bigger
than like in most images it's a

134
00:07:48,610 --> 00:07:53,110
I mean obviously if you're going to not
include resources and their parties are

135
00:07:53,110 --> 00:07:57,800
your knees are bad with you have to stop
yourself by it's a trade offer

136
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:01,370
from and in some cases you will you left
and went Blake

137
00:08:01,370 --> 00:08:05,190
social media share links where you know
you going you're like

138
00:08:05,190 --> 00:08:09,080
I want to created by and so I could
share the stage on

139
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:13,039
Facebook on your face its website and
they say oh here's how you do include

140
00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:14,229
this little

141
00:08:14,229 --> 00:08:17,729
a blocker JavaScript and the likes of
the formal make it for you

142
00:08:17,729 --> 00:08:20,889
but this in your website and than it

143
00:08:20,889 --> 00:08:24,110
a there's like up its share on Facebook
widget

144
00:08:24,110 --> 00:08:28,090
and it makes like lot the requests a
facebook their wares

145
00:08:28,090 --> 00:08:31,879
I and you know if the user is currently
log in to facebook facebook like knows

146
00:08:31,879 --> 00:08:33,269
who they are exactly

147
00:08:33,269 --> 00:08:37,820
not just their brother fingerprint arm
and so instead of doing that there's

148
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:41,919
to plane aged AC Milan for you can make

149
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:45,140
that do very similar things like for the

150
00:08:45,140 --> 00:08:50,410
arm Twitter by and you have to like
openness in a new tab or whatever

151
00:08:50,410 --> 00:08:54,390
to undermine that Twitter pride you
opened in a little pop-up window

152
00:08:54,390 --> 00:08:57,569
but arm buy it much

153
00:08:57,570 --> 00:09:00,779
it that's basically in the way to still
use

154
00:09:00,779 --> 00:09:04,410
a social media sharing with out
including

155
00:09:04,410 --> 00:09:08,040
their party resources on your other

156
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:11,099
arm and a leg for you want to undermine
I

157
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:14,580
I want his voters website I said I want
to put urban for my Twitter account

158
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:17,990
and I they said okay embed this on your
site

159
00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:21,570
so embedded this and I took a look
inmate's request a platform that would

160
00:09:21,570 --> 00:09:25,010
%uh Compu not twitter.com are .tw image
dot com

161
00:09:25,010 --> 00:09:28,120
CD and I API data com and

162
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:32,350
the and you know if someone goes there
and their login to Twitter

163
00:09:32,350 --> 00:09:35,410
actually Twitter now respect do not
track

164
00:09:35,410 --> 00:09:38,860
but they dnt under which is cool but you
know if you don't have the end he had

165
00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:39,360
her

166
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:45,240
than it'll you know logged it like this:
Twitter user went to this website

167
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:49,029
a but all this is just the a buy-in

168
00:09:49,029 --> 00:09:52,260
you know that would be really easy to
make this without a

169
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:56,779
making all these aircraft and so

170
00:09:56,779 --> 00:10:00,399
this is kind of a lot of care because
Twitter we did have a lot of the %uh

171
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:02,920
that's what I did you fire bug you look
at the other

172
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:06,620
and made this myself and so on the

173
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:10,430
straight html-link: to my Twitter
account

174
00:10:10,430 --> 00:10:15,070
and as much as I'm and mister this is
the giant big block a base64 encoded of

175
00:10:15,070 --> 00:10:16,209
the day or i

176
00:10:16,209 --> 00:10:20,420
it's like I it's an image without having
to

177
00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:24,260
actually loading image with their arm

178
00:10:24,260 --> 00:10:28,220
be out so to have things like that
there's no reason to actually use

179
00:10:28,220 --> 00:10:31,810
the bill 10 widget because those are
private

180
00:10:31,810 --> 00:10:36,810
from and you could just make it yourself

181
00:10:36,810 --> 00:10:40,019
Obama so another thing that a lot of you
wanna do is have their Twitter

182
00:10:40,019 --> 00:10:43,250
viewed on their website and E

183
00:10:43,250 --> 00:10:46,850
Twitter most people use the Twitter
batters and comet

184
00:10:46,850 --> 00:10:50,910
like live updating they have like your
researchers on

185
00:10:50,910 --> 00:10:54,899
arm but here's an example of an effort
was like a little

186
00:10:54,899 --> 00:10:58,930
20 points I I where we have a twitter
feed

187
00:10:58,930 --> 00:11:03,880
using that word about and I'll holler
doing and loading it from

188
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:08,630
the service on people owed our website
it build the Twitter feed from there

189
00:11:08,630 --> 00:11:12,709
I'll and there's a couple where they're
doing us I you to do a lot of stuff but

190
00:11:12,709 --> 00:11:14,240
the Twitter API

191
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:19,120
arm by Julie a simple way is every
Twitter account has a Jason URL

192
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:22,160
and you just changed via the user name

193
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:25,750
and you can get feed and

194
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:30,850
here's like a couple lines yes just kept
it shows how to display a Twitter feed

195
00:11:30,850 --> 00:11:34,649
a on your website from the server and
you're not actually sending any traffic

196
00:11:34,649 --> 00:11:35,570
to Twitter

197
00:11:35,570 --> 00:11:41,390
the only request to go to Twitter is
your web-server is making this request

198
00:11:41,390 --> 00:11:44,730
so Twitter only knows you know your
webserver

199
00:11:44,730 --> 00:11:49,050
information and not all yours

200
00:11:49,050 --> 00:11:52,889
comments 0 sometimes you want to use
widgets that are a bit more complicated

201
00:11:52,889 --> 00:11:55,649
than that like update live with Ajax

202
00:11:55,649 --> 00:12:00,610
a and so good don't know what the Humber
Humble Indie Bundle

203
00:12:00,610 --> 00:12:05,160
day they're pretty awesome DRM free
games do what you want

204
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:08,380
I'm imparted money goes to charity and
so I yeah

205
00:12:08,380 --> 00:12:12,480
has won its various and so we were
inventing this widget on our website

206
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:15,820
and they gave us the conductor and we
looked at it and it

207
00:12:15,820 --> 00:12:19,579
does like ajax request Scott like as
quickly as I can

208
00:12:19,579 --> 00:12:22,730
to try an update time remaining: the
bundle sold

209
00:12:22,730 --> 00:12:26,209
arm and we can't do that because that
and I mean everyone

210
00:12:26,209 --> 00:12:29,930
there was a will be sending data
actually like

211
00:12:29,930 --> 00:12:33,639
not to the third party the Humble Indie
Bundle is using to manage their data

212
00:12:33,639 --> 00:12:39,160
and so a what we did is just change the
JavaScript around a bit and made it so

213
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:40,010
that it's an

214
00:12:40,010 --> 00:12:43,279
the data to our own server and their own
server

215
00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:46,290
goes our fetches their requests from
other

216
00:12:46,290 --> 00:12:49,389
arm and and return to and so here's like

217
00:12:49,389 --> 00:12:53,029
a that two-line one mine a

218
00:12:53,029 --> 00:12:56,730
proxy server PHD's kept saying the camp
rock thx growth

219
00:12:56,730 --> 00:12:59,839
arm manager this one kinda overly
complicated

220
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:03,690
a simplified it's a lot more complicated
than ask because

221
00:13:03,690 --> 00:13:07,290
if you have like a thousand people with
your website open

222
00:13:07,290 --> 00:13:10,420
then they're making a thousand AJAX
requests every second and you don't want

223
00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:12,149
to be making a thousand

224
00:13:12,149 --> 00:13:16,820
get requests to service every second you
wanna make like want a request and

225
00:13:16,820 --> 00:13:21,360
return in two thousand people and so you
have to do you know Kasay and

226
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:25,490
you may have to mess with the HTTP
headers said get everything working OK

227
00:13:25,490 --> 00:13:30,000
but this is a general idea and you could
pretty much take any sort

228
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:34,560
Ajax the widget as a send make it as a
quest to their parties

229
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:37,980
and for yourself and

230
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:42,500
not have their bodies to any of your
editor

231
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:46,000
ISO letting users top 10

232
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,360
before including their party gaps army
here

233
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:53,230
is a FA I made a for it was a Twitter
campaign

234
00:13:53,230 --> 00:13:59,010
say from against just by and you put in
your zip code and it looks up to

235
00:13:59,010 --> 00:14:02,589
your representative and specifically
their twitter handles

236
00:14:02,589 --> 00:14:07,540
much between them I am and the thing on
the rate show me this week's

237
00:14:07,540 --> 00:14:11,290
is the optin I if if you click on it

238
00:14:11,290 --> 00:14:14,930
than actually load for Twitter s from

239
00:14:14,930 --> 00:14:18,769
and here's another example this is the

240
00:14:18,769 --> 00:14:22,260
page on our website from

241
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:26,029
threatened voices made this I
interactive

242
00:14:26,029 --> 00:14:29,709
Maps Google Maps Spanglish maps out
journalist

243
00:14:29,709 --> 00:14:33,050
wouldn't render murdered around the
world and I

244
00:14:33,050 --> 00:14:37,040
but you know obviously trend with made
it so it would look kinda from their

245
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:41,010
server and it's based on Google Maps
there was a lot of people contact

246
00:14:41,010 --> 00:14:46,069
arm so we just made this and then when
you put on it it actually worth the wait

247
00:14:46,070 --> 00:14:50,470
I'll so when people are just browsing
through our website and they come here

248
00:14:50,470 --> 00:14:53,649
they're not actually sending any that
you know

249
00:14:53,649 --> 00:14:57,180
trend which is arguable

250
00:14:57,180 --> 00:15:01,300
almonds are doing this is really easy
and here's a quick example of how it

251
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:02,139
works

252
00:15:02,139 --> 00:15:05,180
based in all the top I has a widget
there

253
00:15:05,180 --> 00:15:09,040
and then which it often does I click
your top 10

254
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:13,120
to the winter and then it that's what
they do you want to embed a YouTube

255
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,430
video on your site

256
00:15:14,430 --> 00:15:18,399
what you can do is insider the widget of
dan

257
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:22,180
put an image like a screen for your
YouTube video

258
00:15:22,180 --> 00:15:25,519
and then embed code put your YouTube and
anchored in here

259
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:28,839
and then when you click on the aft and
it just over ate everything inside the

260
00:15:28,839 --> 00:15:29,690
digit

261
00:15:29,690 --> 00:15:33,980
widget Dave with your YouTube video so

262
00:15:33,980 --> 00:15:37,290
I that way you can you know your YouTube
videos

263
00:15:37,290 --> 00:15:40,480
but like if you have a hundred people
earning your website

264
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:43,690
maybe five them watch the video this way
only sending data

265
00:15:43,690 --> 00:15:48,130
five years to you that have a hundred
years

266
00:15:48,130 --> 00:15:51,920
i'ma okay so when you

267
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:56,000
I I when you're setting up your
webserver

268
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,639
you're logging you should try not to log
more than you need

269
00:15:59,639 --> 00:16:02,930
because those largest to fall into the
wrong hands

270
00:16:02,930 --> 00:16:07,040
and there's various wave limiting your
login

271
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:10,050
arm and one way of disabling IP
addresses

272
00:16:10,050 --> 00:16:14,310
%uh so my example their all for Apache
but you can do that then

273
00:16:14,310 --> 00:16:18,529
in most any server software with Apache

274
00:16:18,529 --> 00:16:22,620
I you have I these custom walks runs

275
00:16:22,620 --> 00:16:25,940
and I like we're setting up an Apache
virtual hearst you

276
00:16:25,940 --> 00:16:30,139
by I you do custom log

277
00:16:30,139 --> 00:16:34,290
you have the the file name where you
want your log to be

278
00:16:34,290 --> 00:16:37,820
and you say what logged right you want
and so at least

279
00:16:37,820 --> 00:16:41,690
anyone to you this is where log format

280
00:16:41,690 --> 00:16:45,889
this is like comment is that all of our
and as a ref to find

281
00:16:45,889 --> 00:16:49,250
it's one of the things that the
different keyser West ivory what they

282
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:51,500
are but present day to the idea of

283
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:55,060
as he could copy that make your own
custom log sir and get rid of the birth

284
00:16:55,060 --> 00:16:56,089
and age

285
00:16:56,089 --> 00:17:00,519
because i know it. and then it when you
sup you're looking like this

286
00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:04,549
these logs won't include right here I

287
00:17:04,549 --> 00:17:08,359
I but sometimes you might want to know

288
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:11,500
like if a thousand aggressor coming from
the same IP address

289
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:14,640
over and over and over again and so a

290
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:17,880
here's another track using the software
that

291
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:21,169
I'm working on it not completely done
yet but

292
00:17:21,169 --> 00:17:24,620
its good enough to use on cock up to log
I

293
00:17:24,620 --> 00:17:28,860
we're basically it takes the IP address
portion of the log

294
00:17:28,860 --> 00:17:32,630
and hashes that with the random assault

295
00:17:32,630 --> 00:17:36,610
and from uses that and dad and that's an
insult

296
00:17:36,610 --> 00:17:39,990
changes overnight midnight every night
so

297
00:17:39,990 --> 00:17:45,130
you can tell the difference between Lake
one 1 I've here at making of her class

298
00:17:45,130 --> 00:17:48,610
of the IP addresses anyone arm

299
00:17:48,610 --> 00:17:52,000
and it changes your life strength from
looking like this talking like this

300
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,510
but you know it 192 don't think that i
won 118

301
00:17:55,510 --> 00:18:00,330
made a budget requests it'll always
little this IP address will be analog

302
00:18:00,330 --> 00:18:04,699
I'll and here's how you that

303
00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:09,190
there's a derogatory manner and it's not
there than actually like a website for

304
00:18:09,190 --> 00:18:10,929
eight or a bug tracker

305
00:18:10,929 --> 00:18:14,210
mailing lists or anything those are
coming Sunday

306
00:18:14,210 --> 00:18:17,900
i'ma by it eat

307
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:22,390
so years okay so cut the margin for you
filters also

308
00:18:22,390 --> 00:18:28,130
and Apache which means that you can down
when it breaks your logs and that ever

309
00:18:28,130 --> 00:18:32,460
just saving your life to a file it pipes
are logged into a program

310
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:36,260
running on it on that their and it
villard

311
00:18:36,260 --> 00:18:39,850
comes along with other and so you can
tell it to use

312
00:18:39,850 --> 00:18:43,890
kept a log and then where to rate the
logs and kept a log also

313
00:18:43,890 --> 00:18:47,980
lets you like chain builders so if you
want to use catalog

314
00:18:47,980 --> 00:18:51,860
with Crono log which is that older

315
00:18:51,860 --> 00:18:57,090
filter the less you save your log files
into multiple files like Purdue like you

316
00:18:57,090 --> 00:18:58,399
don't have a different file

317
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:01,840
for each day that and with defilement

318
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:05,129
this is how you do it from

319
00:19:05,130 --> 00:19:08,289
and then also my blog I V hashes

320
00:19:08,289 --> 00:19:13,020
and it's an Apache module that does some
more stuff

321
00:19:13,020 --> 00:19:20,020
on a janitor

322
00:19:23,090 --> 00:19:26,330
armor I mean the main thing you guys
being able to

323
00:19:26,330 --> 00:19:29,990
tell the difference between unita
vicious

324
00:19:29,990 --> 00:19:33,760
yeah for like a tax or for being very
mean you know if yours

325
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:38,000
gap in your life to figure out how much
traffic you've got to one page on Monday

326
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:38,840
or something

327
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:41,990
you can tell how many requests you got
that now how many different people

328
00:19:41,990 --> 00:19:48,990
went to your website you know

329
00:19:54,830 --> 00:20:01,830
yeah you wanna be able to develop house

330
00:20:12,650 --> 00:20:15,830
yeah and actually with tom Corbett log I

331
00:20:15,830 --> 00:20:20,879
you can use the catalog it's a Python
script but you could use that as a om

332
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:23,929
like a unique story even pipe data into
it and

333
00:20:23,929 --> 00:20:27,280
gap datapipe doubts you can
retroactively trip to log

334
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:31,520
all logfile to so if you want to keep
your IP addresses the you can like

335
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:34,720
block abusive idea you can now

336
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:40,200
you to fill the tank up to one year old
Obama

337
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:44,250
so a a lot of content management system

338
00:20:44,250 --> 00:20:48,260
on do lots of after logging you may not
even know about

339
00:20:48,260 --> 00:20:51,400
and especially lot a plugin like we
found out that I

340
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:55,700
burger to the Drupal module shopping
cart software

341
00:20:55,700 --> 00:20:59,250
arm lock like put IP address in the
database

342
00:20:59,250 --> 00:21:03,320
for every every purchase and we were
thinking it might even do it for every

343
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:05,040
time people and stuff to the store

344
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:08,549
to their shopping cart om and

345
00:21:08,549 --> 00:21:12,730
I'll we don't wanna live near earth and
so here is the way to

346
00:21:12,730 --> 00:21:16,640
basically trickier

347
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:20,600
see an ass in the plugin there's the
UMass into not knowing way

348
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:24,059
your visitors data actually is

349
00:21:24,059 --> 00:21:28,668
I as long as you put these lines of code

350
00:21:28,669 --> 00:21:32,020
in you were website somewhere before

351
00:21:32,020 --> 00:21:35,950
your plugins start running than when
you're planning to start running

352
00:21:35,950 --> 00:21:39,380
day when they're trying to access the IP
address the oldest

353
00:21:39,380 --> 00:21:42,669
access to their that what the actual ABS
is over in his eyes

354
00:21:42,669 --> 00:21:46,790
and it earlier Obama

355
00:21:46,790 --> 00:21:50,540
so this is moreover security

356
00:21:50,540 --> 00:21:53,580
thing that a private event bombay

357
00:21:53,580 --> 00:21:57,210
basic authentication issue it's got on
occasion is pretty awesome

358
00:21:57,210 --> 00:22:01,850
and underused a if you have way

359
00:22:01,850 --> 00:22:05,130
an internal web application

360
00:22:05,130 --> 00:22:09,000
just people in your organization uses I
and you want to

361
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:12,559
prevented from getting hacked you could
like what you if you wanted to you could

362
00:22:12,559 --> 00:22:13,190
use

363
00:22:13,190 --> 00:22:16,799
some sort of went out had user than ever
after login

364
00:22:16,799 --> 00:22:21,970
by arm you know you mine updated you I
have their date for that went out

365
00:22:21,970 --> 00:22:25,140
and they might be able to hack into it
by if you I

366
00:22:25,140 --> 00:22:28,530
put basic authentication in front of the
entire

367
00:22:28,530 --> 00:22:32,540
bank than even if you will have their
days worth of free event

368
00:22:32,540 --> 00:22:35,428
they won't be able to exploit them and
they won't even be able to know what's

369
00:22:35,429 --> 00:22:36,080
up for you

370
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:41,399
arm and it's free video and also later
also you could

371
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:45,320
lockdown just pieces love your website
with basic authentication arm

372
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:48,928
which is really nice but a you have to

373
00:22:48,929 --> 00:22:52,190
but the stuff inside a bureaucratic if
they fail or

374
00:22:52,190 --> 00:22:55,520
studies the actor file Obama and

375
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:59,320
the of user file path to a steep after
we

376
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:03,000
is that power you have to create a
buffer file and manage

377
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:07,210
user names and passwords in the file and
their UNIX program called

378
00:23:07,210 --> 00:23:11,040
HD of the weighted they let you do that
and their

379
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:15,168
I thing online tools let you janet is to
you to search for

380
00:23:15,169 --> 00:23:18,660
figure out how to actually managed file
I am

381
00:23:18,660 --> 00:23:21,870
okay and I'm going to the basic of

382
00:23:21,870 --> 00:23:25,720
found here but I guess I was talking
about Google Analytics

383
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:30,059
and how everyone uses and it's not very
private family

384
00:23:30,059 --> 00:23:33,450
I QX is an open-source

385
00:23:33,450 --> 00:23:36,790
PhD my civil application the

386
00:23:36,790 --> 00:23:41,350
pretty awesome and it's a great
alternative mom and its

387
00:23:41,350 --> 00:23:45,659
and don't have using their reality you
for spreading and so

388
00:23:45,659 --> 00:23:49,770
I you know if hope you have that

389
00:23:49,770 --> 00:23:54,429
the neck to be awake you have to hope
done at and I hope number 9.4

390
00:23:54,429 --> 00:23:59,690
that word com net ok number nine dunn et
que tu

391
00:23:59,690 --> 00:24:03,559
a include resources from director have
done that

392
00:24:03,559 --> 00:24:08,549
and that will be fine because American
they're not giving did and to any third

393
00:24:08,549 --> 00:24:11,700
armor and you can they can use it for
like

394
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:14,960
multiple web sites so the same here if
there are a lot of different

395
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:19,770
for each conference I very customizable

396
00:24:19,770 --> 00:24:24,520
there's a lot of privacy settings you
can like Toledo blog you can on my blog

397
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:28,480
out there getting created I and

398
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:31,630
you could write plugins for it if it
doesn't do what you need

399
00:24:31,630 --> 00:24:35,120
an outcall mobile app still Obama

400
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:38,640
but you know like any other analytic
software

401
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:43,260
attract your visitors and so I one thing
that it out so

402
00:24:43,260 --> 00:24:46,750
by default it healthy to include this
blocker JavaScript

403
00:24:46,750 --> 00:24:50,070
arm at the bottom your page they're like
Google Analytics

404
00:24:50,070 --> 00:24:53,520
I but when the doctor on the dust of
Lake

405
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:56,710
detect what plugins you have in your
browser and attack screen resolution

406
00:24:56,710 --> 00:24:57,190
save

407
00:24:57,190 --> 00:25:01,100
your database maybe you don't actually
want this stuff in your PR invest

408
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:05,340
arm but they also have this back which
is an image

409
00:25:05,340 --> 00:25:09,280
tracker that a basically

410
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:12,280
just this HTTP request be

411
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:15,580
get all that data from the HTTP request
but they just don't get

412
00:25:15,580 --> 00:25:19,189
yesterday to JavaScript Heather Christo
arms you actually did

413
00:25:19,190 --> 00:25:22,720
not use the Javascript on museum
attracts

414
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:26,300
and your path and more data on there's a
couple extra

415
00:25:26,300 --> 00:25:30,059
get parameters years if you wanna
happened there for so that you can

416
00:25:30,059 --> 00:25:33,580
I liked the where traffic coming from
euros

417
00:25:33,580 --> 00:25:36,760
arm and so

418
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:39,908
yet services this is a good way if you
like

419
00:25:39,909 --> 00:25:43,580
really paranoid you don't want to store
a lot of user data

420
00:25:43,580 --> 00:25:47,490
ombre your visitor data in your database

421
00:25:47,490 --> 00:25:52,419
then use this one instead little store a
lot less data

422
00:25:52,419 --> 00:25:55,960
arm so here's a screenshot of that I
took from iraq

423
00:25:55,960 --> 00:26:00,570
I a you know browser operating system
usage and

424
00:26:00,570 --> 00:26:04,418
like traffic that after and a

425
00:26:04,419 --> 00:26:08,440
its good to keep in mind that way any of
these third parties

426
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:12,659
can build these exact same graphs about
your website so if you include a Google

427
00:26:12,659 --> 00:26:13,429
web font

428
00:26:13,429 --> 00:26:18,300
Google to build these graphs from your
like about the traffic and

429
00:26:18,300 --> 00:26:21,500
the browsers and operating systems for
your website I

430
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:24,640
and then also they have all the idea and
you know

431
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:28,260
times a day and everything feared you're
basically giving

432
00:26:28,260 --> 00:26:32,280
people a lot of information about you
are all visitors

433
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:35,360
just by including steps to their or an
image or

434
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:38,730
file and

435
00:26:38,730 --> 00:26:42,919
are okay so here is it another basic
authentication track

436
00:26:42,919 --> 00:26:46,020
got hurt and US armagh

437
00:26:46,020 --> 00:26:50,080
so you accuse the spirit that day after
he racked up PHP

438
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:55,270
publicly like you if you want to use the
doctor one you include this file

439
00:26:55,270 --> 00:26:58,440
on your website and damages

440
00:26:58,440 --> 00:27:03,220
an image to the file and

441
00:27:03,220 --> 00:27:04,660
so what's a day

442
00:27:04,660 --> 00:27:09,270
you know you install iraq and you don't
want to update it for a couple years in

443
00:27:09,270 --> 00:27:10,210
another that idea

444
00:27:10,210 --> 00:27:14,600
or you forget to or you don't know how
featured as you can arm

445
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:18,260
in your pageant config file %uh setup

446
00:27:18,260 --> 00:27:22,020
password to all iraq and

447
00:27:22,020 --> 00:27:25,290
you know you have to have the the HT
passer by out there and then make

448
00:27:25,290 --> 00:27:26,200
exceptions

449
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:30,260
for last year that it's being slashed
your data so this way

450
00:27:30,260 --> 00:27:33,590
arm your Buick server could have a

451
00:27:33,590 --> 00:27:38,410
can be completely locked out everything
except for those two your LCD

452
00:27:38,410 --> 00:27:42,320
stock left data from people are for
visiting your website

453
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:45,610
by if anyone tries to go there they
won't be able to get any information

454
00:27:45,610 --> 00:27:48,630
and this is also useful for

455
00:27:48,630 --> 00:27:52,460
for not if you actually walking on any
parts of your website

456
00:27:52,460 --> 00:27:55,860
like during were press and you don't
have

457
00:27:55,860 --> 00:27:59,690
users from the public law and your slave
it's only like the people around the bay

458
00:27:59,690 --> 00:28:03,010
army you can I lockdown

459
00:28:03,010 --> 00:28:06,220
WP login dockage yen-dollar wp-admin

460
00:28:06,220 --> 00:28:12,330
and doubt will mean that if anyone tries
to make any requests to

461
00:28:12,330 --> 00:28:16,570
and any about stuff it'll pop up after
box they will be able to get 30

462
00:28:16,570 --> 00:28:21,559
ir which means that even if someone has
like a zero-day for your version

463
00:28:21,559 --> 00:28:25,280
were present for some plugin they
probably won't be able to exploit

464
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:29,379
okay so

465
00:28:29,380 --> 00:28:33,590
HTTPS popular these days

466
00:28:33,590 --> 00:28:37,040
i'ma and the

467
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:40,840
a I'm sure there's like lots of
information out there about

468
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:45,360
how it's to get the brunt years but also
really fun to use it

469
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:49,140
correctly the and I'll go into more
detail about

470
00:28:49,140 --> 00:28:53,010
the various steps are usually the
escarpment by

471
00:28:53,010 --> 00:28:56,640
on this is a good the resource

472
00:28:56,640 --> 00:29:00,020
that explain some other stuff and
addresses are

473
00:29:00,020 --> 00:29:04,570
jack up a bomb the get

474
00:29:04,570 --> 00:29:08,770
repository part in configuration files
for all of the different servers which

475
00:29:08,770 --> 00:29:10,408
is really awesome time is done

476
00:29:10,409 --> 00:29:14,919
over Apache by if you're using and an
actor using furniture pounder anything

477
00:29:14,919 --> 00:29:15,400
else

478
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:21,270
to do your Spanish buy anything addicted
to do your asses alternation

479
00:29:21,270 --> 00:29:25,030
I the this shows like

480
00:29:25,030 --> 00:29:28,190
what's a first with you has example
convict filed in Italy

481
00:29:28,190 --> 00:29:32,720
arm so it's good to

482
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:36,679
a how they should be off work on our
website and

483
00:29:36,679 --> 00:29:40,290
force people to use https for every
request and

484
00:29:40,290 --> 00:29:44,230
it's really simple to do this hear you
but this and you're crashing into a file

485
00:29:44,230 --> 00:29:44,790
or

486
00:29:44,790 --> 00:29:48,168
managed access file arm a

487
00:29:48,169 --> 00:29:51,270
requires moderate basically if you're
using HTTPS

488
00:29:51,270 --> 00:29:54,540
larger dictation level of it you're not
using HTTPS

489
00:29:54,540 --> 00:29:57,600
then it creates third the aircraft fish
death

490
00:29:57,600 --> 00:30:00,630
and re-direct arm so

491
00:30:00,630 --> 00:30:04,840
anyone who tries to do anything on each
city get rejected a stevia

492
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:08,159
arm

493
00:30:08,159 --> 00:30:12,419
HF yes should be struck transport
security is

494
00:30:12,419 --> 00:30:15,730
something with kinda little-known I
thank

495
00:30:15,730 --> 00:30:19,790
bobbitt them for an part using HDDs
correctly

496
00:30:19,790 --> 00:30:25,950
and Firefox crown maybe even new
Internet Explorer the not sure but like

497
00:30:25,950 --> 00:30:26,990
modern browsers

498
00:30:26,990 --> 00:30:30,559
support it now Obama

499
00:30:30,559 --> 00:30:33,950
and a basically what it says is

500
00:30:33,950 --> 00:30:37,710
if you go to a website over HTTPS in its
depth

501
00:30:37,710 --> 00:30:41,700
check transport security header are I

502
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:45,169
it held your browser never to go to this
website or a city

503
00:30:45,169 --> 00:30:48,870
until enacted fires and so mom

504
00:30:48,870 --> 00:30:53,919
this is important because you can force
people to go to the HTTPS

505
00:30:53,919 --> 00:30:58,140
here but you know someone might they may
click on a shitty way

506
00:30:58,140 --> 00:31:01,790
where they may I just type in the URL or
they might

507
00:31:01,790 --> 00:31:06,090
the getting hacked and someone could
like tricked them into loading HD

508
00:31:06,090 --> 00:31:09,230
users and ash they have an HF TF

509
00:31:09,230 --> 00:31:13,190
if they have it that and I rather for
the demand than

510
00:31:13,190 --> 00:31:17,130
I they will never their browser will
make HD

511
00:31:17,130 --> 00:31:21,800
here and here's how you set that up nght
and here's how you can set it up

512
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:24,800
batting om

513
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:30,010
and the so the reason why it's important
to try and get people not even make HTTP

514
00:31:30,010 --> 00:31:32,059
request better so I and retract

515
00:31:32,059 --> 00:31:35,070
one other reasons is arm cookies

516
00:31:35,070 --> 00:31:39,710
and he doesn't know a different way to
guard against cookies goings-on but

517
00:31:39,710 --> 00:31:43,010
when so cookies RU three sessions

518
00:31:43,010 --> 00:31:47,510
you need tech used to maintain a session
on the web so if you want to log into a

519
00:31:47,510 --> 00:31:49,760
website what they have to kick in the
way that

520
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:52,879
you know your login to the website is
because every time you would let you

521
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:53,870
send your cookie

522
00:31:53,870 --> 00:31:57,120
session ID back to their and so

523
00:31:57,120 --> 00:32:03,120
secure could use are a the cookie header
have had a secure flag

524
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:07,330
and efficacy is secured and that means
that we'll never get sent over HD

525
00:32:07,330 --> 00:32:11,189
which means that like and people don't
do that very often means like even if

526
00:32:11,190 --> 00:32:11,590
you

527
00:32:11,590 --> 00:32:15,510
are forcing HDDs on your whole website
arm and then you get tricked into

528
00:32:15,510 --> 00:32:17,419
loading image to be resource

529
00:32:17,419 --> 00:32:21,290
your session that you will go and the
clear an aggregate hijackers

530
00:32:21,290 --> 00:32:24,559
and to cover your arm but he said the
sector

531
00:32:24,559 --> 00:32:29,080
a the secure flag then that will be
possible to your cookie

532
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:33,399
get sent in the clear ever and if you
get tricked into going to an HTTP lack

533
00:32:33,399 --> 00:32:36,500
you make a request but you want some
effect I

534
00:32:36,500 --> 00:32:39,990
an 8gb only as om

535
00:32:39,990 --> 00:32:43,830
its confusingly named because talking
HTTP protocol

536
00:32:43,830 --> 00:32:48,750
not like tht listed of but basically it
means that

537
00:32:48,750 --> 00:32:52,340
JavaScript doesn't have access to read
this cookie

538
00:32:52,340 --> 00:32:55,830
which the farm because it's getting bags
where you know an attacker

539
00:32:55,830 --> 00:32:59,010
the JavaScript code running in the
conduct you're out there won't be able

540
00:32:59,010 --> 00:33:00,250
to steal your session

541
00:33:00,250 --> 00:33:04,700
so if there's a cover giving website
your account can text on

542
00:33:04,700 --> 00:33:08,909
arm figures I have to do it you know
studies too true

543
00:33:08,909 --> 00:33:12,460
when you are setting a record most of
the time

544
00:33:12,460 --> 00:33:16,510
you're using the Amazon actually setting
session for yourself

545
00:33:16,510 --> 00:33:20,280
and so nght there's a function sessions
at

546
00:33:20,280 --> 00:33:25,168
cookie proud Browns we actually can
change choose what the parameters for

547
00:33:25,169 --> 00:33:30,929
I your session cookies are gonna be as
and as long as you run this before

548
00:33:30,929 --> 00:33:35,030
om the session get started them when
it's at the cookie in the browser it

549
00:33:35,030 --> 00:33:35,760
will

550
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:40,030
said its external HD and also the first
parameter 0

551
00:33:40,030 --> 00:33:44,270
ever as how long it take for the cookie
expires

552
00:33:44,270 --> 00:33:47,429
and he said to the area with a session
cookie which means that expires the

553
00:33:47,429 --> 00:33:48,250
rather

554
00:33:48,250 --> 00:33:51,370
combat units at the throughway

555
00:33:51,370 --> 00:33:55,390
seven days in September something and
then it'll expire after seven if

556
00:33:55,390 --> 00:33:58,919
arm by and where resin were preferable

557
00:33:58,919 --> 00:34:03,740
I it is further than WT configure PHP or
thoughtful things up each day

558
00:34:03,740 --> 00:34:07,390
and that cody gets executed before the
session got started

559
00:34:07,390 --> 00:34:13,500
and you'll have secure HD the only

560
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:16,668
so a the

561
00:34:16,668 --> 00:34:20,219
when you're missing your was there I

562
00:34:20,220 --> 00:34:23,669
use public key authentication if you can
it's better than after a vacation means

563
00:34:23,668 --> 00:34:24,879
that someone

564
00:34:24,879 --> 00:34:28,839
like practically like in most practical
situation it's actually like

565
00:34:28,839 --> 00:34:33,040
pack the developers laptops or something
in order to you

566
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:36,719
connect to the server instead of just
going about for arm

567
00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:40,210
and then use that station after and
after TV to transfer files

568
00:34:40,210 --> 00:34:43,250
don't use FTP it's like really trivial
like

569
00:34:43,250 --> 00:34:47,219
FTP do with their I when you're in a
coffee shop or something every one of my

570
00:34:47,220 --> 00:34:48,169
cock sucked

571
00:34:48,168 --> 00:34:51,819
pick up these about that up to

572
00:34:51,820 --> 00:34:55,359
i'ma again so here

573
00:34:55,359 --> 00:34:59,109
are just some things you can do

574
00:34:59,109 --> 00:35:03,250
to help people who are trying to be
proactive about their private

575
00:35:03,250 --> 00:35:07,450
I try not to require drop after for
stuff

576
00:35:07,450 --> 00:35:10,640
something with you kinda after hired
doctor for the there's

577
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:14,420
but arm if you can make your website
work without Javascript and

578
00:35:14,420 --> 00:35:18,940
have like work better with JavaScript
army don't use flash

579
00:35:18,940 --> 00:35:25,940
yes such as the over now armor

580
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:30,089
I don't block the IP address the proxy
servers because

581
00:35:30,089 --> 00:35:33,540
I and as England door access because

582
00:35:33,540 --> 00:35:36,810
people may use it for spam and people
might use it for ba'ath

583
00:35:36,810 --> 00:35:40,710
by people also will be using the server
is just because their standard in the

584
00:35:40,710 --> 00:35:42,130
media

585
00:35:42,130 --> 00:35:48,089
arm and make sure you've a CDF correctly
and always use https

586
00:35:48,089 --> 00:35:51,690
I and tester site with that are rather

587
00:35:51,690 --> 00:35:56,319
because toward it really important and I
feel like it's getting warm are pouring

588
00:35:56,319 --> 00:35:58,080
all the time especially

589
00:35:58,080 --> 00:36:02,009
are with Blake all the revelations going
on

590
00:36:02,010 --> 00:36:06,310
that people are depending on door and
that like the most common way

591
00:36:06,310 --> 00:36:09,700
the people who are being censored
getting access to stuff

592
00:36:09,700 --> 00:36:13,140
arm and then don't use private email for
their party's over really doing is

593
00:36:13,140 --> 00:36:14,310
they're ready services

594
00:36:14,310 --> 00:36:17,740
and must avoid at where and what you
refer people often

595
00:36:17,740 --> 00:36:21,220
so lazy if you're going to use their
parties are those

596
00:36:21,220 --> 00:36:25,140
make sure that a

597
00:36:25,140 --> 00:36:28,460
you don't use it by default that you
don't send everyone

598
00:36:28,460 --> 00:36:32,910
you only some the data date you need you
together functionality you need

599
00:36:32,910 --> 00:36:36,259
so I call me you know sentimiento data

600
00:36:36,260 --> 00:36:39,990
if people try to play the video don't
actually do for and liked each other

601
00:36:39,990 --> 00:36:43,970
hell by or Google Checkout by something
do the same thing don't actually

602
00:36:43,970 --> 00:36:47,460
load scripts from their services to then
you're getting paid going to law

603
00:36:47,460 --> 00:36:51,150
all this information

604
00:36:51,150 --> 00:36:54,930
Obama so everyone uses

605
00:36:54,930 --> 00:36:57,950
can't imagine systems is there's by

606
00:36:57,950 --> 00:37:02,910
the and it makes it really communion
makes it way easier to update it makes

607
00:37:02,910 --> 00:37:03,549
it

608
00:37:03,550 --> 00:37:07,330
arm so that you know you have multiple
people managing content

609
00:37:07,330 --> 00:37:10,960
by if you have some serb high-security
fan don't use a CMS

610
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:14,810
or you see an ass and then dislike make
a static version

611
00:37:14,810 --> 00:37:18,890
have postman that arm because

612
00:37:18,890 --> 00:37:22,129
content management systems can get
hacked because you know there's a

613
00:37:22,130 --> 00:37:23,220
database on the back

614
00:37:23,220 --> 00:37:26,490
so there could be people in Jax there's
you know

615
00:37:26,490 --> 00:37:31,180
some sort of language running the code
like PHP Ruby or Python or something

616
00:37:31,180 --> 00:37:36,210
and there could be bugs an actor arm and
that's what like 99 percent

617
00:37:36,210 --> 00:37:39,780
web hacking is attacking contact her
acting

618
00:37:39,780 --> 00:37:44,040
web applications if you don't have a lot
of his nephew to serving static files

619
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:47,080
than the only way to hack into the
website

620
00:37:47,080 --> 00:37:51,650
is through this servers you need if I am
i can. vulnerability and Apache Ranjan

621
00:37:51,650 --> 00:37:52,550
acts or whatever your

622
00:37:52,550 --> 00:37:57,690
service operators and that's a lot
harder so if you have Lake

623
00:37:57,690 --> 00:38:01,100
like a really high security thing and
you want to just

624
00:38:01,100 --> 00:38:04,380
serve them information om and

625
00:38:04,380 --> 00:38:08,380
and would really suck if you're server
got hacked than

626
00:38:08,380 --> 00:38:11,690
then just try make I

627
00:38:11,690 --> 00:38:14,690
and obviously that that I can you can't
have drafter stuff like people

628
00:38:14,690 --> 00:38:15,780
commenting

629
00:38:15,780 --> 00:38:20,160
by Tom if you don't mean that stuff make

630
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:27,160
and that is it are there any question

631
00:38:35,290 --> 00:38:38,660
yet actually with

632
00:38:38,660 --> 00:38:42,660
Buick arm I that

633
00:38:42,660 --> 00:38:46,759
the anonymizer IP addresses part lets
you choose to me by to the IP address

634
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:47,480
dr.

635
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:50,880
and so you can like shoes the first
three made that you are the first two

636
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:51,690
bytes or whatever

637
00:38:51,690 --> 00:38:55,640
but arm

638
00:38:55,640 --> 00:38:59,290
pick it up and then I think the first
two bytes probably product

639
00:38:59,290 --> 00:39:04,339
an enemy but also I what we do is we
have a local geolocation database

640
00:39:04,339 --> 00:39:08,060
and do look up something out here as in
store the country

641
00:39:08,060 --> 00:39:11,339
and then so we know work

642
00:39:11,339 --> 00:39:18,339
region people are coming from even
though we don't either

643
00:39:29,690 --> 00:39:32,549
our mouth using Donnell two

644
00:39:32,549 --> 00:39:36,059
to do the HTTP after tht only love it

645
00:39:36,059 --> 00:39:40,460
David arm probably

646
00:39:40,460 --> 00:39:44,609
by its it can't hurt to keep tunnels
open by

647
00:39:44,609 --> 00:39:48,130
it but I mean probably as liars set up
correctly and you have

648
00:39:48,130 --> 00:39:55,130
wake you know certificate getting signed
in

649
00:40:17,380 --> 00:40:20,710
yeah

650
00:40:20,710 --> 00:40:23,660
yeah i mean you could have a backup
sayin still use iraq

651
00:40:23,660 --> 00:40:27,240
arm but yeah i mean i think thats a for

652
00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:31,310
Blake like if you can if if it makes
sense for you

653
00:40:31,310 --> 00:40:34,549
then you should do it that way way Tor
project dark

654
00:40:34,550 --> 00:40:37,720
arm its database youth a

655
00:40:37,720 --> 00:40:41,750
sort of the MFN but then they compile
into a bunch of static code and that's

656
00:40:41,750 --> 00:40:42,540
what gets host

657
00:40:42,540 --> 00:40:49,540
and so you can act or credit cards in
there

658
00:41:18,070 --> 00:41:25,070
will not if you're doing it over HTTPS

659
00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:39,800
yeah also you mean even if arm

660
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:43,350
even if ya mitch Seavey ass as she is
the best authentic Asian

661
00:41:43,350 --> 00:41:47,080
in it'll go over plan tax but chances
are in attackers to someone

662
00:41:47,080 --> 00:41:50,549
sitting there on the internet it in your
web server 92 this into

663
00:41:50,550 --> 00:41:54,820
capture traffic as you're like man so
chances are they'll protect your

664
00:41:54,820 --> 00:42:01,820
I

665
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:11,560
and are now I think that up

666
00:42:13,590 --> 00:42:20,590
cover

667
00:42:22,370 --> 00:42:24,609
I mean nothing's wrong with that saddam

668
00:42:24,610 --> 00:42:28,300
oh iight well be wrong with you then

669
00:42:28,300 --> 00:42:31,810
javascript files hosted on its own
website arm

670
00:42:31,810 --> 00:42:36,540
then there are nothing's wrong with a
and I mean a lot I have to do its just a

671
00:42:36,540 --> 00:42:39,990
I a lot of people use notes crafts any
not a lot of people

672
00:42:39,990 --> 00:42:45,870
a few people use Netscape are I armor

673
00:42:45,870 --> 00:42:49,790
and the people that are trying to be

674
00:42:49,790 --> 00:42:53,170
like a specially security and privacy
contest

675
00:42:53,170 --> 00:42:57,870
you tend to use that and get to make
your website not rely on its list all

676
00:42:57,870 --> 00:42:58,330
works

677
00:42:58,330 --> 00:43:02,020
I mean a lot there's a lot of things you
you can't do without Javascript so

678
00:43:02,020 --> 00:43:09,020
yeah

679
00:43:39,010 --> 00:43:41,110
yes oh what decided that Tom

680
00:43:41,110 --> 00:43:45,290
a I think that a lot of plugins for them
asses

681
00:43:45,290 --> 00:43:48,480
I record IP address data and years are
worth

682
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:52,020
caching proxy labor Nasher squared or
something died

683
00:43:52,020 --> 00:43:55,800
it won't actually know what the user's
IP addresses much is that we tell it to

684
00:43:55,800 --> 00:44:02,800
now what do you do that

685
00:44:14,489 --> 00:44:17,859
others I know that like are talking
about

686
00:44:17,859 --> 00:44:24,859
proxy liked or would look cool block it
like

687
00:44:25,039 --> 00:44:28,170
if you've ever used story you do a
google search and it makes you enter a

688
00:44:28,170 --> 00:44:30,140
reCAPTCHA and so you know I and

689
00:44:30,140 --> 00:44:34,900
flow Osama I though I think that the
main reason michael that that's because

690
00:44:34,900 --> 00:44:35,569
people

691
00:44:35,569 --> 00:44:38,970
arm abuse for an hour and so people

692
00:44:38,970 --> 00:44:43,369
I think that I think that they did that
with any idea yesterday detective using

693
00:44:43,369 --> 00:44:43,980
their

694
00:44:43,980 --> 00:44:47,220
there server and so about

695
00:44:47,220 --> 00:44:50,499
about because people abused or exit now
that's why

696
00:44:50,499 --> 00:44:54,319
they are also arm its publicly look

697
00:44:54,319 --> 00:44:57,700
you can probably look a bit of the three
if they're correct

698
00:44:57,700 --> 00:45:01,019
so you can so that you didn't text or
active

699
00:45:01,019 --> 00:45:08,019
not sorry attack other office

700
00:45:20,159 --> 00:45:20,699
yeah

701
00:45:20,699 --> 00:45:23,869
yet and it's actually a up

702
00:45:23,869 --> 00:45:28,699
it's built and if you act you can arm I
set account up to delete log so i'd

703
00:45:28,699 --> 00:45:34,999
arm you log individual arose that
connects your IP address your user agent

704
00:45:34,999 --> 00:45:38,029
and like other and i won what page you
head

705
00:45:38,029 --> 00:45:42,029
are many databases that you got a lot of
hats the knit table thought really fast

706
00:45:42,029 --> 00:45:45,119
and you can tell it to aggregate all
this data

707
00:45:45,119 --> 00:45:48,839
sewing so it in aggregate form you can
just feel like

708
00:45:48,839 --> 00:45:52,089
what web browser super user and Mike why
Tom

709
00:45:52,089 --> 00:45:55,619
countries people are coming from but you
can't actually connection at like

710
00:45:55,619 --> 00:45:57,679
someone from this country was eating
with my brother

711
00:45:57,679 --> 00:46:04,679
and then just delete the individual of I
mean I'm not

712
00:46:06,649 --> 00:46:13,649
I'm not really sure by are I think

713
00:46:28,180 --> 00:46:28,470
I've

714
00:46:28,470 --> 00:46:31,700
well I mean people also like

715
00:46:31,700 --> 00:46:35,830
packed church or I don't know about I
don't know what what Google does too

716
00:46:35,830 --> 00:46:42,830
to figure this out but armor

717
00:46:48,440 --> 00:46:55,440
so flash for was active

718
00:47:01,650 --> 00:47:02,840
the problem with glass

719
00:47:02,840 --> 00:47:06,200
is there Tom it doesn't work overt or

720
00:47:06,200 --> 00:47:09,630
I mean you can use flash when using tor
but

721
00:47:09,630 --> 00:47:14,850
flashes the vulnerability class can be
used to Deanna myself and so

722
00:47:14,850 --> 00:47:19,170
if someone is using tor and also trying
to use and also using Flash

723
00:47:19,170 --> 00:47:22,670
which the Tor browser bundle w/ do arm
but all

724
00:47:22,670 --> 00:47:25,820
a than it will

725
00:47:25,820 --> 00:47:29,040
like York and also flashes just really

726
00:47:29,040 --> 00:47:36,040
a

727
00:47:58,370 --> 00:48:00,420
well you don't get that stuff for

728
00:48:00,420 --> 00:48:03,900
visitors to your website not all the
only people like daughter warming up

729
00:48:03,900 --> 00:48:04,550
there

730
00:48:04,550 --> 00:48:08,340
so just suggest you know clock what you
need to collect trying to say

731
00:48:08,340 --> 00:48:11,830
but down don't track everyone on our
website

732
00:48:11,830 --> 00:48:18,830
as much

733
00:48:39,680 --> 00:48:40,660
arm

734
00:48:40,660 --> 00:48:47,660
so any money

735
00:49:02,060 --> 00:49:05,330
done any stuff on ARM a

736
00:49:05,330 --> 00:49:09,490
blocking refers to reside and organs are
thumbs up arm

737
00:49:09,490 --> 00:49:16,490
I don't

738
00:49:50,480 --> 00:49:51,300
yeah

739
00:49:51,300 --> 00:49:57,140
you could UW's JavaScript and DMSO their
gray and stuff but

740
00:49:57,140 --> 00:50:00,069
it you know there's way too hard and
there's ways to make it so that you

741
00:50:00,070 --> 00:50:01,150
arent leaking private

742
00:50:01,150 --> 00:50:08,150
private data your business

743
00:50:26,450 --> 00:50:28,470
yeah I mean you can also do the

744
00:50:28,470 --> 00:50:32,900
the lake up and down like don't actually
include the iframe until people click

745
00:50:32,900 --> 00:50:33,420
something

746
00:50:33,420 --> 00:50:37,250
and that and I think emblem using Java
like if you want people to be able to

747
00:50:37,250 --> 00:50:38,820
like what it is I me a video

748
00:50:38,820 --> 00:50:45,820
you have to use JavaScript to do that

749
00:50:51,280 --> 00:50:58,280
arm

750
00:50:59,470 --> 00:51:01,650
like if you're sorry attacked and they
get here

751
00:51:01,650 --> 00:51:05,480
hauser left I mean that kind of sucks I
haven't anywhere Obama

752
00:51:05,480 --> 00:51:08,810
yeah %uh

753
00:51:08,810 --> 00:51:13,210
I don't know actually I looked at like
perhaps AFC password files the earth

754
00:51:13,210 --> 00:51:16,830
I just use the aka

755
00:51:16,830 --> 00:51:21,940
which lingered arm yeah I don't know I'm
not sure others waved him

756
00:51:21,940 --> 00:51:28,940
make them better anyone off

757
00:52:04,539 --> 00:52:04,900
yeah

758
00:52:04,900 --> 00:52:10,059
Obama I i mean under a local

759
00:52:10,059 --> 00:52:14,460
if not you need to do that stuff it's
like late you want to influenza and

760
00:52:14,460 --> 00:52:16,500
proxy the ajax request and stuff

761
00:52:16,500 --> 00:52:19,819
you have to Lake kinda have a pretty
deep understanding

762
00:52:19,819 --> 00:52:23,819
all the moving parts to do that and so
arm

763
00:52:23,819 --> 00:52:27,630
I turn out like I wish I were you there
like I think of making more privacy

764
00:52:27,630 --> 00:52:30,700
friendly stuff that the Lake if

765
00:52:30,700 --> 00:52:36,490
the a if one if you know when you make
embed code for people to bed

766
00:52:36,490 --> 00:52:39,890
up on their website like included the up
ten

767
00:52:39,890 --> 00:52:43,650
hang yourself so that everyone will have
the top down and and things like that

768
00:52:43,650 --> 00:52:47,589
arm be I mean I know there's a lot of
people who like

769
00:52:47,589 --> 00:52:51,269
are like an activist and they make a
bunch a website for all these groups

770
00:52:51,269 --> 00:52:51,920
like I've

771
00:52:51,920 --> 00:52:56,109
I'm a website for like 20 different
groups in the past several years and

772
00:52:56,109 --> 00:52:59,670
ir if I had and like this

773
00:52:59,670 --> 00:53:02,809
like eight years ago and stuff I had
known all this stuff back mana

774
00:53:02,809 --> 00:53:06,700
all the love that they were made was
very much mark private and I think that

775
00:53:06,700 --> 00:53:10,759
like the nerds were an activist groups
who are like the people making a website

776
00:53:10,759 --> 00:53:12,299
that they learn that stuff

777
00:53:12,299 --> 00:53:15,339
way arm than

778
00:53:15,339 --> 00:53:22,339
I think that guys on your way

779
00:53:48,880 --> 00:53:49,440
yeah

780
00:53:49,440 --> 00:53:54,260
well all the FEA I mean it's not like
you install Drupal or press

781
00:53:54,260 --> 00:53:57,490
at will Dion private the family had a
ball it's just that

782
00:53:57,490 --> 00:54:00,780
arm people on top of that whether bonds
of and its

783
00:54:00,780 --> 00:54:05,130
I think you there's no way I view it's
impossible to use Google Analytics and a

784
00:54:05,130 --> 00:54:05,960
private developer

785
00:54:05,960 --> 00:54:09,480
you just can't and so there's nothing
that we can tell Google

786
00:54:09,480 --> 00:54:12,390
to make a more private the families were
standing all day that's just the nature

787
00:54:12,390 --> 00:54:13,350
how ther

788
00:54:13,350 --> 00:54:18,000
party services you look at your site
where which sucks because a lot of stuff

789
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:19,300
that's really cool

790
00:54:19,300 --> 00:54:22,440
didn't like the modern weapons like a
platform in houston

791
00:54:22,440 --> 00:54:25,950
everything together and like had knapper
it's like

792
00:54:25,950 --> 00:54:29,450
it skate skate left for you know
apartments and then put them on a map

793
00:54:29,450 --> 00:54:30,690
for units of some

794
00:54:30,690 --> 00:54:34,870
but it's impossible to make happen after
without like sending all your visitors

795
00:54:34,870 --> 00:54:35,609
dated a girl

796
00:54:35,610 --> 00:54:39,090
and let you like you know you the other
three maps the house the whole mapping

797
00:54:39,090 --> 00:54:41,590
database yourself for something and
that's like a la marque's other

798
00:54:41,590 --> 00:54:45,360
and so I i mean I think that

799
00:54:45,360 --> 00:54:48,810
some other stuff is just hard to do. and
Dom

800
00:54:48,810 --> 00:54:53,850
I for people who are especially high
risk like

801
00:54:53,850 --> 00:55:00,850
activists in warranted to just take the
threat of

802
00:55:15,030 --> 00:55:18,420
there so how much of the problem the
latest wave innocent oversight and how

803
00:55:18,420 --> 00:55:19,000
much of it

804
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:22,510
is up like just

805
00:55:22,510 --> 00:55:26,609
the relevant I I mean I think that
developers don't know about us

806
00:55:26,609 --> 00:55:30,950
I think that Lake there's times I've
people who are making website for like

807
00:55:30,950 --> 00:55:34,309
you know different occupies and Mike
Texas and wherever else

808
00:55:34,309 --> 00:55:37,420
who have no idea they shouldn't be
including Google advance from

809
00:55:37,420 --> 00:55:40,619
Google servers and they you know like if
they knew about it maybe they would do

810
00:55:40,619 --> 00:55:42,170
it but they don't know about it

811
00:55:42,170 --> 00:55:48,059
subclan I'm dealing with %uh I okay I
think my time is up now

812
00:55:48,059 --> 00:55:48,680
thank you
