1
00:00:00,049 --> 00:00:03,439
develop different based on our abilities
she calls it

2
00:00:03,439 --> 00:00:06,640
the smartphone penetration testing
framework

3
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:10,540
drinking a beer from Alabama to present
this information to you

4
00:00:10,540 --> 00:00:13,660
I was introduced to revive him thank you

5
00:00:13,660 --> 00:00:20,660
well okay with class I'm actually came
up for Mississippi right

6
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:29,449
you know that hold now area are all
about an owner herb Mr been there

7
00:00:29,449 --> 00:00:33,210
so yeah under it's dark in here I can't
fear

8
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:36,930
but hopefully you can see me and
everyone can hear me this is

9
00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:41,120
the smartphone plan has framework it
does not yet have a cool name

10
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:45,959
those are the only man right now is SPM
which I think sounds like sunscreen

11
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:50,930
them it here can think up a cool name
for an assistant name I get darker by

12
00:00:50,930 --> 00:00:52,770
all means country after

13
00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:56,559
I'm releasing it technically at Black
Hat a couple weeks so hopefully I'll

14
00:00:56,559 --> 00:00:57,920
have a cool name by then

15
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:01,829
but I'm crowd surfing at very few bigger
than anything do let me know

16
00:01:01,829 --> 00:01:06,320
so her talk on them Alan Garber

17
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:10,220
this whole project is the product
undesirable fast-track grant and I'll

18
00:01:10,220 --> 00:01:12,130
talk more about time for fast-track

19
00:01:12,130 --> 00:01:15,710
and into the talk but basically this
allowed me to

20
00:01:15,710 --> 00:01:19,720
one quit my job my job said well we own
everything you do and

21
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:23,429
I didn't really like that very much so
there's actually allowed me to quit the

22
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:26,640
job and work full time for myself and
start my own company

23
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:30,750
which has been oddly lucrative you
should all start your own company it's

24
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:34,710
oddly not hard to make money doing the
kind of things we do everybody needs it

25
00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:40,030
so like the darker now I get to say I am
CEO not doing your pen tester number

26
00:01:40,030 --> 00:01:42,030
nine though the 921

27
00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:46,720
so love love love the dark rock alright

28
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:52,158
so the problem at hand naturally we have
smart phones that work

29
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:55,240
everybody wants to be able to put their
smartphones on the network

30
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:59,079
bringing our smart grocers to work in
not having them attached to

31
00:01:59,079 --> 00:02:02,590
the network in attached to but the email
server in third

32
00:02:02,590 --> 00:02:06,670
that's not such a big problem but once
we start putting our email then

33
00:02:06,670 --> 00:02:10,068
are company filed on them and they can
communicate the Palmer

34
00:02:10,069 --> 00:02:17,069
nicer than things and have a good thing
I'm a later point I mean I

35
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:20,879
said I can leverage the scheme and okay

36
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:25,429
anywhere so we are smarter than our
fears as I would like to put my phone on

37
00:02:25,430 --> 00:02:27,879
my anger into my iPad on my blackberry

38
00:02:27,879 --> 00:02:31,910
on the network why we're used to putting
devices on the network

39
00:02:31,910 --> 00:02:35,269
we're really good at monitoring traffic
in and out on the network women doing

40
00:02:35,269 --> 00:02:35,640
this

41
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:38,690
for a long time we pretty much got that
down pat

42
00:02:38,690 --> 00:02:42,410
what we don't like however is out and
communication

43
00:02:42,410 --> 00:02:45,620
we generally frown on that we don't like

44
00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:50,230
to not know where all Mr traffic is
going what information is going out to

45
00:02:50,230 --> 00:02:50,829
them

46
00:02:50,830 --> 00:02:54,390
other entity we don't like that very
much

47
00:02:54,390 --> 00:02:58,239
in corporate security however that's
kinda how smartphones

48
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:01,540
work period had few their own mobile
network which

49
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:06,090
we as the security team at a company
we're not really able to monitor that so

50
00:03:06,090 --> 00:03:06,610
much

51
00:03:06,610 --> 00:03:09,940
whereas we can monitor things going
through our network

52
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:13,940
we can see every packet everyone here we
can't really see what's going on

53
00:03:13,940 --> 00:03:17,489
say with 80 in here T Mobile and all
that data

54
00:03:17,489 --> 00:03:20,489
could be radically be going our

55
00:03:20,489 --> 00:03:26,450
over that Adam and communication that's
just the nature this marker

56
00:03:26,450 --> 00:03:30,190
so what are our smartphones actually
doing our work place these are a few of

57
00:03:30,190 --> 00:03:31,629
the things I've seen him do

58
00:03:31,629 --> 00:03:35,290
one of course the access our data this
your company email

59
00:03:35,290 --> 00:03:39,400
and it's great to have come but you know
thanks heartburn particularly

60
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:43,280
if you work from home and you want to
pretend you're actually sitting at the

61
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:46,010
desk working when you're actually you
know how did the beach

62
00:03:46,010 --> 00:03:49,629
your emails are coming in you can
respond to your boss if you respond

63
00:03:49,629 --> 00:03:51,659
clients instigator work done

64
00:03:51,659 --> 00:03:55,189
is awesome everybody loves it I'd hate
to see it go away but

65
00:03:55,189 --> 00:03:58,840
think about the things you put in those
emails I've got my

66
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:03,620
reports a guy I'm talking back and forth
with my coworkers about lunch on this on

67
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:04,110
this

68
00:04:04,110 --> 00:04:08,200
Sir Bernard can you help me out with
this isn't talking back and forth about

69
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:11,569
information probably my clients would
not enjoy

70
00:04:11,569 --> 00:04:15,819
to seeing out there in the world and
again we can all go out and about on

71
00:04:15,819 --> 00:04:19,959
Lima we connect our VPN reas mercosur

72
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:23,419
any credentials we've been honored the
BP and the government pretty good BPM

73
00:04:23,419 --> 00:04:24,990
software for this mark brown

74
00:04:24,990 --> 00:04:28,720
but still anything that's stored on a
smartphone any communication from the

75
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:29,479
smartphone

76
00:04:29,479 --> 00:04:33,940
is theoretically at risk and I've also
seen them generate

77
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:37,580
actual one-time passwords to log into
the VPN themselves over

78
00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:41,109
software to do that is sitting there on
the smartphones our

79
00:04:41,110 --> 00:04:44,840
the Don heartburn again there once again
you might be a winner

80
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:48,110
Hammond feel your one has words and
generate them themselves

81
00:04:48,110 --> 00:04:52,050
so all things that we need to work on
and I think

82
00:04:52,050 --> 00:04:56,180
of so the threats against the
smartphones

83
00:04:56,180 --> 00:04:59,750
malicious app we've seen a lot of that
in the news

84
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:03,380
there's always a malicious at particular
the Android don't forget about the

85
00:05:03,380 --> 00:05:04,190
iPhone

86
00:05:04,190 --> 00:05:07,789
Charlie Miller lengthens did get a
malicious app on the iPhone store

87
00:05:07,789 --> 00:05:11,820
it does happen is a little harder I
think the reason we see more met with

88
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:12,650
Android is

89
00:05:12,650 --> 00:05:16,520
because it's so much easier why did the
time there was a really good talk

90
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:21,620
I'm where winter why they think monetary
we're seeing the attacks we are why

91
00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:23,190
we're not seeing more attacks

92
00:05:23,190 --> 00:05:26,719
on a smartphone this just because
there's more browsers better

93
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:32,180
I E or Firefox in there are at Mobile
Safari or your Android browsers their

94
00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:33,100
monetary

95
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:38,110
if your gonna pop browsers you get more
that way but and more smartphones go out

96
00:05:38,110 --> 00:05:41,280
I think that's gonna change around see a
lot more tax

97
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:45,520
I'm now be download an app users
download an app as best they could bring

98
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:46,609
your own device

99
00:05:46,610 --> 00:05:50,759
good luck trying to them not to bring
now bring down any app they want

100
00:05:50,759 --> 00:05:53,979
an they're not gonna like that very much
shower

101
00:05:53,979 --> 00:05:58,490
any at the table down even if you have
seven players to try and stop them

102
00:05:58,490 --> 00:06:02,750
I've Donna Tartt where users to our
people know I am prisoner has a I can

103
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:05,539
get past the system he was at the
renewed in the superior

104
00:06:05,539 --> 00:06:08,789
Highland it'll get through anything at
my work so

105
00:06:08,789 --> 00:06:12,919
we can't really trust anything other
than place to try and stop these things

106
00:06:12,919 --> 00:06:17,258
sewer malicious app happen big example
is shown up in the news was

107
00:06:17,259 --> 00:06:21,090
the jury dream attack I was a while ago
but there's been more

108
00:06:21,090 --> 00:06:25,630
skills for dinner remotely control your
phone so anything with honors suspect

109
00:06:25,630 --> 00:06:29,000
every time you download an app this
could happen particularly with the

110
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,759
Android with the permission model where
basically you say okay you may

111
00:06:32,759 --> 00:06:36,560
exploit my phone now its quite easy

112
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:40,880
now what if your employees have a
malicious angry bird out on

113
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:44,360
they have Angry Birds course they do you
wouldn't be able to keep your employees

114
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:45,770
if they were allowed her

115
00:06:45,770 --> 00:06:49,000
Angry Bird but they download an ad on
this and they're going to get

116
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,380
special levels and what if its militias
want a bit

117
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:58,130
still there dana what can you do that
happens not this

118
00:06:58,130 --> 00:07:02,690
software bugs have been few just about
every jailbreak on iphone

119
00:07:02,690 --> 00:07:07,699
4.0 and above has started with an issue
in Mobile Safari

120
00:07:07,699 --> 00:07:11,330
because it allowed to run unsigned code
and nothing else pretty much is

121
00:07:11,330 --> 00:07:15,419
and yet we still jailbreak it so like
any other software software that comes

122
00:07:15,419 --> 00:07:16,830
on your smart phones

123
00:07:16,830 --> 00:07:20,530
has bugs and add to that can be
exploited your ad humbug

124
00:07:20,530 --> 00:07:23,880
particularly when I written by
third-party developers

125
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:28,159
you now you don't have to take a
security development course in order to

126
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:29,870
sign up for any of the App Store

127
00:07:29,870 --> 00:07:33,150
they're not make you take a test to
prove you know how to do secure

128
00:07:33,150 --> 00:07:33,919
development

129
00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:38,620
you just pair money and sign-up colonel
also have bugs

130
00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:42,030
are smart from her knowledge in early
just when ex-cons we know our Linux

131
00:07:42,030 --> 00:07:43,970
kernel have bugs

132
00:07:43,970 --> 00:07:48,090
smart bone development is pretty much
the same its gonna have the same issues

133
00:07:48,090 --> 00:07:52,539
a lot on the cases you can those poor
occur how exploit our

134
00:07:52,539 --> 00:07:55,740
from is regularly next tuesday and a
ride

135
00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:59,389
not much to report it's the same had a
boner believe that the Linux kernel and

136
00:07:59,389 --> 00:08:00,789
uneven are

137
00:08:00,789 --> 00:08:05,469
saw her skin would be exploited before
you're not completely up-to-date

138
00:08:05,470 --> 00:08:08,819
or there's a very rare unamir software
or an hour

139
00:08:08,819 --> 00:08:11,870
them they're vulnerable we do happen all
the time

140
00:08:11,870 --> 00:08:14,830
particularly with and her and when it
doesn't actually update a lot of our

141
00:08:14,830 --> 00:08:15,810
users

142
00:08:15,810 --> 00:08:19,310
if you have an Android phone again older
Android phone for instance

143
00:08:19,310 --> 00:08:22,940
I did my first research I G one I still
have the G one

144
00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:27,199
had never gotten anything past 1.6 so
it's gonna roll that everything

145
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:30,440
I recently broke on my phone them with
Bonner

146
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:34,349
and burn burn it down or Android phone
at best buy a prepaid one

147
00:08:34,349 --> 00:08:37,990
became with entered 2.3 sir ginger Redd

148
00:08:37,990 --> 00:08:41,909
ginger break how nicer people are going
buying the ISM

149
00:08:41,909 --> 00:08:45,580
is not pushing out up does anyone their
definitely

150
00:08:45,580 --> 00:08:50,040
this can happen so people bring their
own devices in your workplace

151
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:54,730
are they up to date completely question
mark

152
00:08:54,730 --> 00:08:59,010
social engineer some you may have gotten
that that text message from target

153
00:08:59,010 --> 00:09:00,890
actually got it on my iPhone

154
00:09:00,890 --> 00:09:04,089
the border who this is

155
00:09:04,089 --> 00:09:08,709
them okay it says congratulations your
entry into last month's growing want a

156
00:09:08,709 --> 00:09:11,319
free one thousand dollar target giftcard

157
00:09:11,319 --> 00:09:15,399
inner this number at 30 not combine blah
blah

158
00:09:15,399 --> 00:09:19,680
but it started to conduct something else
.biz

159
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:23,889
know I am me and asked person who does
because I would think our

160
00:09:23,889 --> 00:09:27,559
social engineering attacks but as
someone up investor does a lot of

161
00:09:27,559 --> 00:09:31,469
phishing attacks and they're not always
particularly good phishing attacks and

162
00:09:31,470 --> 00:09:35,300
it's surprising how well they do for
instance a couple weeks ago I did one

163
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:38,410
and actually went to spam on the company
mail server which of course

164
00:09:38,410 --> 00:09:43,269
I was blamed for but I still managed to
get about five user's credentials

165
00:09:43,269 --> 00:09:47,120
so they had to pull in data spam it said
defendant outlook this is

166
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:50,339
possibly a phishing attack please don't
click anything

167
00:09:50,339 --> 00:09:54,339
so they got another spam they sought
warning they could on anyway if they put

168
00:09:54,339 --> 00:09:55,360
in their credentials

169
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:59,899
so basis for someone who is dead I don't
know what they're talking about

170
00:09:59,899 --> 00:10:03,300
and what is your dog smarter and even
your like okay

171
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:06,749
it's an email I know about this I don't
know who this is from

172
00:10:06,749 --> 00:10:11,100
I shouldn't quick honest they get a text
message with a link it with a text

173
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:13,050
message how can text hurt you

174
00:10:13,050 --> 00:10:17,499
well it can and that's probably got a
lot of users by the time I got it

175
00:10:17,499 --> 00:10:19,399
appeared that already been taken down
but

176
00:10:19,399 --> 00:10:23,209
I'm sure they got a lot of people there
for that I'm sure it had a nice

177
00:10:23,209 --> 00:10:27,749
brother exploit their would hit all my
phone who I don't update them

178
00:10:27,749 --> 00:10:30,819
why would I do that nobody else does
either

179
00:10:30,819 --> 00:10:35,998
so we can download or malicious app we
can open a browser that has an exploit

180
00:10:35,999 --> 00:10:39,980
we can put our credentials then the same
for the problems we see on the PC is

181
00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:43,920
same her to phishing attacks we're
starting to see them here

182
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:47,990
the thing about smartphones is with the
SMS I think this is why is going to be

183
00:10:47,990 --> 00:10:49,740
the definite future as spam

184
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:52,740
spam filtering email actually getting
pretty good

185
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:56,100
and the in with my fishing attacked it
went to spam its

186
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:59,660
really annoying for someone is trying to
be phishing attacks

187
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:04,929
but think about what azima is there any
spam filtering for SMS

188
00:11:04,929 --> 00:11:08,050
no unless I specifically block it

189
00:11:08,050 --> 00:11:12,189
specific number I'm going to give an
antenna so I think if I were

190
00:11:12,189 --> 00:11:17,389
some big timer mobile fire who wanted
send out spam I would start moving on to

191
00:11:17,389 --> 00:11:18,279
that the masses

192
00:11:18,279 --> 00:11:21,360
I can pretty much guarantee they're
going to get there

193
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:24,839
so I think that the future and we don't
really have anything in place and I've

194
00:11:24,839 --> 00:11:28,709
yet to see as security awareness policy
the growing number as the math yet or

195
00:11:28,709 --> 00:11:30,589
anything else with a smartphone apps
like

196
00:11:30,589 --> 00:11:34,170
don't click on things in your email the
end with you know all that works

197
00:11:34,170 --> 00:11:38,719
our on a ball game here

198
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:42,660
jailbreaking a lot of her clients there

199
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:46,689
we don't allow users to generate their
phones and beyond the environment i know

200
00:11:46,689 --> 00:11:49,120
im gonna talk and then home owner is
their hands as

201
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:52,879
if I read name the superuser filed as
you 1

202
00:11:52,879 --> 00:11:58,949
my companies checks don't see it I get
on the network just fine

203
00:11:58,949 --> 00:12:03,199
sewer people are gonna jailbreak as long
as smartphones require after

204
00:12:03,199 --> 00:12:04,889
jailbreaking an olive be

205
00:12:04,889 --> 00:12:09,129
functionality that we won our devices
people are going to jail break them

206
00:12:09,129 --> 00:12:13,259
people are going to go out to the
internet and look up jailbreak

207
00:12:13,259 --> 00:12:16,689
my iPhone which may take them to god
knows what site

208
00:12:16,689 --> 00:12:20,290
we know there are plenty of jailbreak
that have their source code available

209
00:12:20,290 --> 00:12:21,379
that are

210
00:12:21,379 --> 00:12:25,230
perfectly good bye even if it is
available

211
00:12:25,230 --> 00:12:28,620
how does the end user who can't read
seeker lover

212
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:32,100
thanks in no small or anything like not

213
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:35,139
how are they going to know he gonna
jailbreak me dot com

214
00:12:35,139 --> 00:12:39,490
but its spell wrong and you downloaded
jailbreaking it indeed does jailbreak

215
00:12:39,490 --> 00:12:40,350
your phone

216
00:12:40,350 --> 00:12:43,939
but what else does it do you basically
click yes and said please

217
00:12:43,939 --> 00:12:48,559
exploit my phone so you basically given
them permission

218
00:12:48,559 --> 00:12:53,040
to do whatever religious thing they want
once your route on any other smartphones

219
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:57,009
while party on iphone as I found out but
if your router

220
00:12:57,009 --> 00:13:00,749
now you can do stuff all sorts of stuff
have you seen any of my previous

221
00:13:00,749 --> 00:13:01,610
research

222
00:13:01,610 --> 00:13:05,069
I did the nasty stuff with baseband mama
botnet

223
00:13:05,069 --> 00:13:09,279
by reading found know anybody who
jailbreaks they get a malicious site

224
00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:12,870
that knows what they're going to get on
there a shame in saying all their

225
00:13:12,870 --> 00:13:14,290
traffic going in an hour

226
00:13:14,290 --> 00:13:18,089
a dollar emailed and yes'm traffic is
not

227
00:13:18,089 --> 00:13:21,779
very well been created so driver Makati

228
00:13:21,779 --> 00:13:27,079
to GM games over someone other than
jailbreaking program actually doing

229
00:13:27,079 --> 00:13:31,549
once you get a jailbroken user in your
environment game's pretty much over

230
00:13:31,549 --> 00:13:35,669
the question is are we able to stop it
or not are leaving there's any way right

231
00:13:35,669 --> 00:13:36,539
now to be alone

232
00:13:36,539 --> 00:13:39,819
day there's no jailbroken users in mind
I'm

233
00:13:39,819 --> 00:13:43,139
so my question and be in the ball back

234
00:13:43,139 --> 00:13:47,179
when I felt well not really being
addressed so I'm up investor my period

235
00:13:47,179 --> 00:13:51,500
that's what I do most of the time and
then my client like okay

236
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:54,799
we have all the smartphones we've
allowed people to bring in our Android

237
00:13:54,799 --> 00:13:57,199
dinner I burned and what not into the
environment

238
00:13:57,199 --> 00:14:00,730
I'd like to test them here what the
security posture

239
00:14:00,730 --> 00:14:04,839
the smartphones and me and all the other
hand gestures no I don't really know

240
00:14:04,839 --> 00:14:08,160
there's not really anything I can do to
tell you one way or another

241
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:12,629
sir there I'm Martyn how do I access the
printer

242
00:14:12,629 --> 00:14:16,629
so I was kinda middle of so what other
now from

243
00:14:16,629 --> 00:14:20,449
you can actually do like open nothing
from the smartphone which my stuff gets

244
00:14:20,449 --> 00:14:21,740
kinda group in with that

245
00:14:21,740 --> 00:14:25,809
the different than actually been testing
the smartphone runs contesting from this

246
00:14:25,809 --> 00:14:26,709
marker on

247
00:14:26,709 --> 00:14:30,480
example and one other store the DNC in
much here online

248
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:34,009
and now been all other sources things
from your smartphone which again if

249
00:14:34,009 --> 00:14:35,029
you're at the beach

250
00:14:35,029 --> 00:14:39,639
and want to do your work and often after
this the divers

251
00:14:39,639 --> 00:14:43,649
years author Martin to live for you
sounds like backtrack is that for

252
00:14:43,649 --> 00:14:46,199
smartphones are has everything all set
up

253
00:14:46,199 --> 00:14:50,179
if you've ever tried to install and
nothing to losing a few other useful

254
00:14:50,179 --> 00:14:54,319
having an RT set up for you don't have
to download any dependencies

255
00:14:54,319 --> 00:14:58,759
I'm sure users admired who will be glad
to see that on wannabes as well

256
00:14:58,759 --> 00:15:02,689
they all have to download the Pearl
dependencies doctors work

257
00:15:02,689 --> 00:15:07,169
that was actually another darker product
the movie sec looks pretty cool

258
00:15:07,169 --> 00:15:11,039
I've been having smartphone app search
been I want to work on that her

259
00:15:11,039 --> 00:15:14,449
we get a third party after we wrote an
hour can we had

260
00:15:14,449 --> 00:15:19,589
whether it's secure not does it the and
riders at experis data over and open

261
00:15:19,589 --> 00:15:20,659
interfaces

262
00:15:20,659 --> 00:15:25,809
does it in securely store things rentals
on the SD card

263
00:15:25,809 --> 00:15:29,480
down a little calmer created does that
there's a few others

264
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:33,089
there's been a lot of work in that area
when I haven't seen is actually the

265
00:15:33,089 --> 00:15:35,299
Pennhurst in the smartphone devices

266
00:15:35,299 --> 00:15:38,639
just for the issues the same sorta
issues we see on our busiest

267
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:42,370
do we have a default SSH password are we
now know today

268
00:15:42,370 --> 00:15:45,990
are we able to you social engineer
people into

269
00:15:45,990 --> 00:15:49,649
clicking on my links downing our things
like that

270
00:15:49,649 --> 00:15:52,970
I didn't really find that there was
anything other do that

271
00:15:52,970 --> 00:15:56,379
so that's the problem I wanted to solve
with this

272
00:15:56,379 --> 00:16:00,549
actually the real story is I went to a
conference in Kali Columbia

273
00:16:00,549 --> 00:16:03,899
like not Columbia South Carolina
Columbia the country

274
00:16:03,899 --> 00:16:07,329
and the Navy down their perch me and
wanted me to write really not malicious

275
00:16:07,329 --> 00:16:10,189
software that will definitely make me
lose my password

276
00:16:10,189 --> 00:16:14,230
the course I said no but then I thought
about it house like you know

277
00:16:14,230 --> 00:16:17,529
if I did this from a non malicious
tampering mourned the pen tester

278
00:16:17,529 --> 00:16:21,279
I did like the same sort of things they
want I'm and basically told would

279
00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:25,429
exploit devices like they don't know how
to use it delivers click Yes to exploit

280
00:16:25,429 --> 00:16:26,299
everything

281
00:16:26,299 --> 00:16:31,929
so they can spy on our entire country
British government never do that today

282
00:16:31,929 --> 00:16:35,240
yeah so i thought well if I could do
something like this

283
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:38,829
kinda like a menace boy for margolick be
really cool

284
00:16:38,829 --> 00:16:42,500
thank you columbia Navy for giving me
this great idea

285
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:46,699
%um so structure the framework

286
00:16:46,699 --> 00:16:49,809
has pictures and all that great I'm

287
00:16:49,809 --> 00:16:53,620
our I never okay no we've got the server

288
00:16:53,620 --> 00:16:57,889
basically it has like one big thurber or
we can have multiple ones you can run

289
00:16:57,889 --> 00:16:59,139
all on one machine

290
00:16:59,139 --> 00:17:03,019
it's kinda like on this point we can put
it all over the place organ is running

291
00:17:03,019 --> 00:17:07,010
altogether got a database work keeps
information

292
00:17:07,010 --> 00:17:11,089
it's got a couple have interfaces so we
can actually control this from our

293
00:17:11,089 --> 00:17:13,398
smartphones it has a smartphone app

294
00:17:13,399 --> 00:17:16,949
that will allow us to from our smart
burn actually interact with the

295
00:17:16,949 --> 00:17:18,079
framework

296
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:22,168
we that's really cool because a lot of
what we do with this framework obviously

297
00:17:22,169 --> 00:17:23,159
is going to be

298
00:17:23,159 --> 00:17:26,510
over the modem so we can actually meet a
man who can either

299
00:17:26,510 --> 00:17:31,210
plug into USB known into it to the
machine using or just connected to a

300
00:17:31,210 --> 00:17:32,830
smartphone who put in a

301
00:17:32,830 --> 00:17:36,369
prepaid sim if you don't wanna tell your
clients you're actual number

302
00:17:36,369 --> 00:17:39,879
who has been in a cemetery added to the
framework internal actual use the modem

303
00:17:39,879 --> 00:17:40,879
in the phone

304
00:17:40,879 --> 00:17:44,280
the doer mobile modem attacks I'm

305
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:48,350
weekend is Ryan from we have a console
only be releasing run from your laptop

306
00:17:48,350 --> 00:17:50,320
to your workstations

307
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:54,480
and but we're going to be after the red
phones we want to

308
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:58,859
assess and possibly exploit these
markers in the environment

309
00:17:58,859 --> 00:18:03,320
sewer we who want to turn the red so we
actually have imposed exploitation

310
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:06,020
agents for them as well as we do exploit
someone

311
00:18:06,020 --> 00:18:11,540
we can install an agent and then for
instance tell it to take a picture or

312
00:18:11,540 --> 00:18:15,168
gather data of a bit or make it dude are
a half hour

313
00:18:15,169 --> 00:18:19,889
I'm trying do because exploitation my
privilege escalation to run some other

314
00:18:19,889 --> 00:18:23,580
the known attacks like for Android it
runs raging in the Cajun

315
00:18:23,580 --> 00:18:29,668
things like that so to see a if they're
vulnerable to those as well

316
00:18:29,669 --> 00:18:32,830
so the first thing we have is the
framework consul if you use the social

317
00:18:32,830 --> 00:18:34,540
engineer toolkit

318
00:18:34,540 --> 00:18:37,799
it kinda looks like that is very menu
based which

319
00:18:37,799 --> 00:18:42,139
I kinda wanna turn it more and her I'm
Amazon console one-third being menu

320
00:18:42,139 --> 00:18:43,159
based

321
00:18:43,159 --> 00:18:46,590
cooking for all those menus a hundred
times a day like I do and I'm testing it

322
00:18:46,590 --> 00:18:48,109
so annoying

323
00:18:48,109 --> 00:18:52,070
for we will look at it gonna be some
demos but it looks a lot like that I

324
00:18:52,070 --> 00:18:52,750
think

325
00:18:52,750 --> 00:18:56,619
but of course has different options this
is all perl based

326
00:18:56,619 --> 00:18:59,850
so if you have her on your machine and
has a couple under

327
00:18:59,850 --> 00:19:02,879
actor packages you have to download but
other than that

328
00:19:02,879 --> 00:19:06,799
just runs in Pearl it works fine

329
00:19:06,799 --> 00:19:10,158
just at a bar pretty much or

330
00:19:10,159 --> 00:19:13,250
I'll have to do it thanks to my mom my
mom's much

331
00:19:13,250 --> 00:19:18,159
security program and then I am her she
made a nice GUI for us to look at that

332
00:19:18,159 --> 00:19:18,980
as well

333
00:19:18,980 --> 00:19:23,260
has all the same functionality is that
we can dislike click in little boxes on

334
00:19:23,260 --> 00:19:27,200
click girl animal do so. this is all web
based

335
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:30,290
again it leaders have her pearl in your
web server

336
00:19:30,290 --> 00:19:34,740
and Ron and serve your having problem
with it that's probably why

337
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:39,070
I'm Mon pearl is not easy to install the
time one thought

338
00:19:39,070 --> 00:19:42,158
I'm here trying to do it you're smarter
than me

339
00:19:42,159 --> 00:19:47,590
so but exams or something discomfort
hurling it even has run into a bar

340
00:19:47,590 --> 00:19:52,750
with them and then got cool things like
boxes that we can fill and we could get

341
00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:53,799
admission

342
00:19:53,799 --> 00:19:58,149
does everything for us without the menu
is there a few users really like to use

343
00:19:58,149 --> 00:20:01,669
but and this is something they can use

344
00:20:01,669 --> 00:20:06,359
also been our right now I only have one
for Android I'm in development for the

345
00:20:06,359 --> 00:20:07,100
others

346
00:20:07,100 --> 00:20:11,090
but we have an app that actually allows
you going to attach to the framework

347
00:20:11,090 --> 00:20:12,369
news that murder in the

348
00:20:12,369 --> 00:20:18,149
in the smart turned into your tax thing
actually launch attacks

349
00:20:18,149 --> 00:20:21,570
a lot of the same functionality on all
the my friends as you can

350
00:20:21,570 --> 00:20:24,619
clear the database for insider the
smartphone app because that would you

351
00:20:24,619 --> 00:20:26,209
catch the app in that would

352
00:20:26,210 --> 00:20:29,250
not feel very good I think they're a
subset

353
00:20:29,250 --> 00:20:34,210
the things you can do with the actual
framework actually do from the app

354
00:20:34,210 --> 00:20:37,369
branson's browser exploits

355
00:20:37,369 --> 00:20:41,879
we've had it run this the WebKit exploit
right here from the smartphone

356
00:20:41,879 --> 00:20:45,100
and I'll try discount rate ago and he
will

357
00:20:45,100 --> 00:20:48,100
do not be being so that rather if it is
Monaro on

358
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:52,040
actually British Elle back to the
framework

359
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:56,059
so what we can actually test for right
now would have a subset of things

360
00:20:56,059 --> 00:20:59,070
in each of these categories I'm still in
a darker

361
00:20:59,070 --> 00:21:03,450
processor I'm basically doing a couple
things made category a man who's gonna

362
00:21:03,450 --> 00:21:06,669
and more and more there's a lotta issues
with smartphones others

363
00:21:06,669 --> 00:21:10,399
you get pretty big who wouldn't has
remote monitor billion on a smartphone

364
00:21:10,399 --> 00:21:11,260
if there are

365
00:21:11,260 --> 00:21:15,230
remote exploit on any of them as course
in our modern Dave

366
00:21:15,230 --> 00:21:18,299
platforms a little bit harder to do I'm

367
00:21:18,299 --> 00:21:21,740
you know Windows seven I don't believe
it has not been here a moment more

368
00:21:21,740 --> 00:21:24,480
ability than either

369
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:27,740
but for instance on the board at this
age password on a

370
00:21:27,740 --> 00:21:31,990
jailbroken iPhone a test for that that
the remote exploit certainly it there

371
00:21:31,990 --> 00:21:36,440
you login with this hour login and
password and gives you root

372
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:39,470
access that's I'm former exploited by
ever saw one

373
00:21:39,470 --> 00:21:43,750
so I can do that I'm prime time on our
ability is so not put up a malicious web

374
00:21:43,750 --> 00:21:44,639
page

375
00:21:44,639 --> 00:21:48,070
but cars trucks why use them why we see
with any other

376
00:21:48,070 --> 00:21:52,250
brother exploitation I just poured it in
here you tell it to do that he put up

377
00:21:52,250 --> 00:21:55,530
the web page in as a text message to the
user

378
00:21:55,530 --> 00:21:58,960
on that on that you want to catch saying
hey this is a cool page go look at it

379
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:01,909
with the link I open it and tries to
exploit their browser

380
00:22:01,909 --> 00:22:05,490
is there Bama roll it pushes a shell
Michael a framework

381
00:22:05,490 --> 00:22:08,830
also does social engineering it can do

382
00:22:08,830 --> 00:22:13,040
a couple different text messages in all
tell you again to open a call page it

383
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:14,619
will tell you to open

384
00:22:14,619 --> 00:22:18,459
are to download a collapse not very
sophisticated yet you're there any

385
00:22:18,460 --> 00:22:20,480
better than this is a cool app

386
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:23,490
but for demo purposes that works

387
00:22:23,490 --> 00:22:26,809
and also local on our ability is how
well view

388
00:22:26,809 --> 00:22:31,090
exploit it will let you run privilege
escalation against the burns as well

389
00:22:31,090 --> 00:22:34,699
her humping like reading in the cage it
will see if it works right now I just

390
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:36,240
dropped the privileges

391
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:41,440
going to put more stuff in a review post
post exploitation iceberg right now

392
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:45,490
it just says yes the rework and rub the
privileges and goes on

393
00:22:45,490 --> 00:22:48,549
not particularly malicious

394
00:22:48,549 --> 00:22:51,950
now example barroom remote vulnerability

395
00:22:51,950 --> 00:22:55,149
another jailbroken iPhones by default
they all have the same

396
00:22:55,149 --> 00:22:58,149
as a stage password Alpine so I just

397
00:22:58,149 --> 00:23:01,450
you get an IP address to test
international law into it

398
00:23:01,450 --> 00:23:04,460
and if it is successful actually
installing agent on their

399
00:23:04,460 --> 00:23:08,149
so no I didn't now the POS exploitation
on it

400
00:23:08,149 --> 00:23:11,409
and records the data Vista networker did
not

401
00:23:11,409 --> 00:23:14,899
there are a lot of a large succeed if
there's no at this stage there

402
00:23:14,899 --> 00:23:18,830
nobel obviously I don't try and log in
and they have change their password

403
00:23:18,830 --> 00:23:24,178
you fail but if it is in fact no normal
which mine is and I'm pretty sure like

404
00:23:24,179 --> 00:23:27,510
when you don't see the demo you're gonna
see the IP address on my iPhone and I'm

405
00:23:27,510 --> 00:23:31,129
pretty sure are not going to have an
iPhone software money into the stock

406
00:23:31,129 --> 00:23:34,379
love you can just get on my network
which oddly enough does not have a

407
00:23:34,379 --> 00:23:35,530
password so

408
00:23:35,530 --> 00:23:39,490
all you can get on my network and had
that with my iPhone

409
00:23:39,490 --> 00:23:43,320
there it is in fact a vulnerable or
going to share their

410
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:48,059
their I'm pretty sure of the wipe it out
a bit even turned on by the in the dark

411
00:23:48,059 --> 00:23:50,760
so that is your goal is to wipe out my
iPhone

412
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:55,090
can often be re-used version 4.3 even
though this should be easy

413
00:23:55,090 --> 00:23:58,970
read a hacer contigo I'm ok

414
00:23:58,970 --> 00:24:02,090
got time on ability example now again

415
00:24:02,090 --> 00:24:06,379
smartphone browsers Martin PDF viewers
there are more normal other things as

416
00:24:06,379 --> 00:24:06,840
well

417
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:11,350
just like any other platform i'm for
instance the first jailbreak again

418
00:24:11,350 --> 00:24:16,889
iPhone IRS for was it started with a
brother X Y and PDF issue in the war

419
00:24:16,889 --> 00:24:17,950
Safari

420
00:24:17,950 --> 00:24:21,220
and comics Carly payments were has

421
00:24:21,220 --> 00:24:25,629
I'm Apple said no one will exploit this
phone you can't run and I'm heard

422
00:24:25,629 --> 00:24:29,359
requires the browser can run and i'd
cody has to run whatever

423
00:24:29,359 --> 00:24:34,090
when paid out there tell it to you I'm
Mobile Safari that's written by Apple we

424
00:24:34,090 --> 00:24:35,408
know that it's not malicious

425
00:24:35,409 --> 00:24:38,950
various open up a malicious page in a
hoops

426
00:24:38,950 --> 00:24:42,080
no more safe smart I'm

427
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:45,960
and then we deliver I am kernel exploit
an on how you get rude

428
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:49,169
to them things work here on our
smartphones her

429
00:24:49,169 --> 00:24:53,149
it are you there we can get them to
serve to malicious page

430
00:24:53,149 --> 00:24:56,840
we can possibly explain their browser
and I could possibly lead to router

431
00:24:56,840 --> 00:25:01,459
even so are the smarTrend rather than
your organization vulnerable

432
00:25:01,460 --> 00:25:04,909
I don't really know that you waited 10
that rather than let's see let's see if

433
00:25:04,909 --> 00:25:07,690
users will one click on just anything
which

434
00:25:07,690 --> 00:25:12,299
we know they do so yeah and we'll see if
you actually get the shower

435
00:25:12,299 --> 00:25:15,980
that's how are you kidding

436
00:25:15,980 --> 00:25:20,559
so for the social engineering basically
as the messages I think the new email

437
00:25:20,559 --> 00:25:24,480
for spam and phishing attacks and
definitely will be more more sir

438
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:28,399
target you as a mascot tells me it's
true it's not the first one I've gotten

439
00:25:28,399 --> 00:25:29,049
but

440
00:25:29,049 --> 00:25:32,539
I was pretty widespread a lot of people
got it I'm

441
00:25:32,539 --> 00:25:35,549
so open a web site or

442
00:25:35,549 --> 00:25:39,658
download this app more users doing I
think probably like for instance T

443
00:25:39,659 --> 00:25:41,869
Mobile keep sending me this thing words
like

444
00:25:41,869 --> 00:25:46,309
because your premium hands that user and
even know that means

445
00:25:46,309 --> 00:25:49,530
your premium handset user so you can
download the security

446
00:25:49,530 --> 00:25:54,299
at and it did a third party after twenty
mobile

447
00:25:54,299 --> 00:25:57,510
App Store for the Android so I'm sure is
really key mobile

448
00:25:57,510 --> 00:26:01,090
but they're not only helping the problem
United is anathema says that

449
00:26:01,090 --> 00:26:04,440
your premium customer you can now
download this often

450
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:07,889
security at and is going to exploit you
so our

451
00:26:07,889 --> 00:26:12,509
I can do that anybody can be there so
yeah

452
00:26:12,509 --> 00:26:15,950
leave are you did actually respond to
this I'm soon as you give me a list of

453
00:26:15,950 --> 00:26:17,710
numbers in your organization

454
00:26:17,710 --> 00:26:24,070
often up things like this do it and see
who responds

455
00:26:24,070 --> 00:26:27,939
local example again our smartphone
however colonel Boehner bill it is there

456
00:26:27,940 --> 00:26:29,399
does Linux kernels

457
00:26:29,399 --> 00:26:34,740
doing secure development is hard a lot
harder than my job of exploiting answer

458
00:26:34,740 --> 00:26:38,220
keep your curls up today but who really
does

459
00:26:38,220 --> 00:26:42,320
I don't sewer your jailbreak use this

460
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:46,309
malicious app uses during dream ran
ranging in the cage

461
00:26:46,309 --> 00:26:50,360
are breaded beer source code after a
dream and really

462
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:54,090
all they did was take z4root and port
and

463
00:26:54,090 --> 00:26:58,389
so is exactly the same code heard really
are the people who are making malicious

464
00:26:58,389 --> 00:27:00,830
after just taking jailbreak maps

465
00:27:00,830 --> 00:27:04,389
an putting the inner behind some nice

466
00:27:04,389 --> 00:27:08,269
looking colour that either against in
had games and then I had

467
00:27:08,269 --> 00:27:12,539
like adult website add them think so
pick your poison about what

468
00:27:12,539 --> 00:27:17,100
interesting app you want to download and
now start exporting years of your boner

469
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:18,809
will turn known issue

470
00:27:18,809 --> 00:27:22,769
which since update I never thought I'd
say anything nice about Microsoft

471
00:27:22,769 --> 00:27:26,529
but you know on Patch Tuesday happens my
have my

472
00:27:26,529 --> 00:27:30,629
all my computers they restarted in the
morning and now they're up today

473
00:27:30,629 --> 00:27:34,480
that's a little far not so much with my
smartphones really there

474
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:38,620
starting to put all them over the year
used to be that a plug in iPhone and I

475
00:27:38,620 --> 00:27:41,450
don't update my iTunes library very
often

476
00:27:41,450 --> 00:27:45,080
they are pushing it over the air now
there with blackberry saw and heard was

477
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:47,590
originally the only one that pushed it
over the air

478
00:27:47,590 --> 00:27:51,190
but now the worst because they never
push out their updates if you're not

479
00:27:51,190 --> 00:27:54,929
Nexus One Nexus and 30 other Google
platform good luck getting your

480
00:27:54,929 --> 00:27:58,409
updates in a reasonable amount of time
they have support

481
00:27:58,409 --> 00:28:03,220
the Android to the the platform in
question I could take forever

482
00:28:03,220 --> 00:28:06,820
if you've got an older phone you may
never get so gonna be vulnerable for

483
00:28:06,820 --> 00:28:07,860
ever

484
00:28:07,860 --> 00:28:11,539
I am recently Joburg somebody's phone
for them are not gonna pay a twenty

485
00:28:11,539 --> 00:28:12,740
boxers number now

486
00:28:12,740 --> 00:28:16,450
I know this is gonna be hard and have to
get one other newer jailbreak for her

487
00:28:16,450 --> 00:28:17,259
banana

488
00:28:17,259 --> 00:28:20,389
Android 2.1 click OK I don't do this

489
00:28:20,389 --> 00:28:24,519
this is quite simple and that is never
got updates on your end users don't

490
00:28:24,519 --> 00:28:26,029
think about stuff like this

491
00:28:26,029 --> 00:28:29,440
the phone I'm picture should have
written a

492
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:33,940
presentation and iPhone I actually saw
in Columbia from like the 1800 at like

493
00:28:33,940 --> 00:28:35,450
one step up from

494
00:28:35,450 --> 00:28:39,419
to cut them a stern that's what most
users see when they see a smarter

495
00:28:39,419 --> 00:28:43,990
love it makes cause little as other cool
stuff to do to make my life easier

496
00:28:43,990 --> 00:28:47,379
I don't think evan is a computer

497
00:28:47,379 --> 00:28:50,399
whose number is currently in their
proposed exploitation you can get a

498
00:28:50,399 --> 00:28:51,840
command shell

499
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:54,919
lot of stuff would like two brothers
you're not root yet so

500
00:28:54,919 --> 00:28:58,840
can't install pingchat so you get a
command shell on from there even start

501
00:28:58,840 --> 00:29:01,610
doing past explanations try and get ruch

502
00:29:01,610 --> 00:29:05,029
I'm I do have a nap based agents around
don't happen

503
00:29:05,029 --> 00:29:09,009
and functionality in it for that has
different pay learn so I can isn't it

504
00:29:09,009 --> 00:29:10,580
like an SMS or

505
00:29:10,580 --> 00:29:15,129
over HTTP Intel please send a SMS
message to this other person

506
00:29:15,129 --> 00:29:19,190
know that for me or please run this
privilege escalation attempt and it will

507
00:29:19,190 --> 00:29:20,070
do that

508
00:29:20,070 --> 00:29:24,559
and im or please send me all your SMS is
that you've ever received

509
00:29:24,559 --> 00:29:27,559
it will do that please email your
contacts

510
00:29:27,559 --> 00:29:31,860
it'll do that so definitely still in the
works but this is

511
00:29:31,860 --> 00:29:35,799
when I have now how we doing on time
here

512
00:29:35,799 --> 00:29:39,668
know now you do some demos and I said I
was going to do is all I've

513
00:29:39,669 --> 00:29:43,019
I'm going to try but I did actually
checking out this morning and make

514
00:29:43,019 --> 00:29:43,929
videos

515
00:29:43,929 --> 00:29:47,610
let me bring fails I've learned a lot
about

516
00:29:47,610 --> 00:29:51,419
smartphone emulators in this project and
I've learned that they have bugs

517
00:29:51,419 --> 00:29:55,379
at crazy bugs there's a lot of things
wrong with the emulators and

518
00:29:55,379 --> 00:30:00,370
ridiculous and BS MS actually goes over
network instead of being as a methodist

519
00:30:00,370 --> 00:30:03,730
doesn't arrive in a reasonable amount of
time it is never get it

520
00:30:03,730 --> 00:30:07,279
those really bad pretenders therapies
device could bear

521
00:30:07,279 --> 00:30:10,899
it does work but we have videos in case
it doesn't

522
00:30:10,899 --> 00:30:14,490
but we're actually Gallagher a few the
interfaces and

523
00:30:14,490 --> 00:30:18,669
have to do a few things

524
00:30:18,669 --> 00:30:24,190
alright this flap couple of the Garba
and they didn't give me much memory so I

525
00:30:24,190 --> 00:30:27,960
actually know my Mac Mini I'm here doing
a lot of the heavy lifting

526
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:31,539
but let me start up my emulators I leave
them

527
00:30:31,539 --> 00:30:38,539
alive too long maybe hang so meanwhile
even

528
00:30:38,610 --> 00:30:41,720
start-up one that's going to have the
Android ap

529
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:47,019
on it and start up one is gone and the
agent answer number one that's going to

530
00:30:47,019 --> 00:30:50,320
be our third victim

531
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:54,178
so forgive the memory can hardly run

532
00:30:54,179 --> 00:31:01,179
3 emulators their who this weeken

533
00:31:08,539 --> 00:31:15,539
mothers are starting our member here to
my other guy im

534
00:31:17,990 --> 00:31:21,160
so this will actually run backtrack the
only problem with running and on

535
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:22,140
backtracked on

536
00:31:22,140 --> 00:31:26,270
course for I wanted to run it is that it
day apache server does not have Mon hurl

537
00:31:26,270 --> 00:31:30,610
so I just seemed a lot easier to deserve
this is the Ubuntu I put them on it so

538
00:31:30,610 --> 00:31:32,820
it's just gonna run of that web server

539
00:31:32,820 --> 00:31:36,090
on than otherwise it all in as pearl

540
00:31:36,090 --> 00:31:39,800
whether a couple an ongoing has to have
expect

541
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:44,440
and it has to have and DVI connection to
database to my big goal

542
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:48,230
no i jus got my people data is running
here

543
00:31:48,230 --> 00:31:52,030
so you can I like movie now you have it
all on one machine or

544
00:31:52,030 --> 00:31:56,820
his the emulators that a memory problem
not the framework itself so if you're

545
00:31:56,820 --> 00:31:58,490
actually exporting real phones

546
00:31:58,490 --> 00:32:01,970
and not emulators been you'll have no
trouble running on

547
00:32:01,970 --> 00:32:06,150
just your normal laptop but you can also
spread it out so I've got

548
00:32:06,150 --> 00:32:11,870
the data is here on the regular laptop
got the actual free marguerite here and

549
00:32:11,870 --> 00:32:12,450
then

550
00:32:12,450 --> 00:32:15,920
I need to move the emulators over there
to do that has texting at the RAM

551
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:22,790
hmm year him

552
00:32:22,790 --> 00:32:27,450
so I just if I grew up to an hour I just
got all this and the source code for

553
00:32:27,450 --> 00:32:30,850
this is being released in a couple weeks
the Black Panthers will be online you

554
00:32:30,850 --> 00:32:31,830
can download it

555
00:32:31,830 --> 00:32:35,500
the BSD license so you can use it
however you want

556
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:39,840
but basically our

557
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:44,700
Hollister creamer got her lawyer and
welcomed a smart move in this framework

558
00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:48,110
version 0.1 which basically means if it
fails

559
00:32:48,110 --> 00:32:51,480
send me a bug report now fix it this is
the initial release

560
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:55,620
sir things could go wrong possibly we
have a few options

561
00:32:55,620 --> 00:33:00,810
am a good one to do to start to clear
the data rates I was doing on a testing

562
00:33:00,810 --> 00:33:03,190
so I'm of london ont and the my denim
and

563

564
00:33:07,060 --> 00:33:10,490
area I say yes and it is recreate my
database for me

565
00:33:10,490 --> 00:33:17,490

00:35:03,170 --> 00:35:08,030
actually from the framework it can be
any 7 did icky icky he won his

596
00:35:08,030 --> 00:35:12,930
easy to type so that's what I use for
dinner and your I'll have

597
00:35:12,930 --> 00:35:17,520
so Honors College group them so just
where is going to communicate on a web

598
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:18,160
server

599
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:22,350
that mean is that correct I say yes and
it waits for

600
00:35:22,350 --> 00:35:26,290
the absence you know our

601
00:35:26,290 --> 00:35:31,300
I didn't need to get the IP on the web
server worth going to check in

602
00:35:31,300 --> 00:35:35,630
sobers this is all local where you can
do it on our an hour

603
00:35:35,630 --> 00:35:40,680
internet facing interface and do this
they really an actor

604
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:44,480
would it be to put in the same
parameters are hooked him

605
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:49,160
and the same he be kind as a little TCP
connection for us

606
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:55,830
and it connected but are you a connected

607
00:35:55,830 --> 00:35:59,520
and could see what things can we do with
this

608
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:04,680
on we could run a remote attacker
rummage through the eye Petersham Ivan

609
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:08,240
let me finish the demo for you whatever
our

610
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:11,870
RNs our

611
00:36:11,870 --> 00:36:15,490
Tigers Rd killed it haven't you so I
needed

612
00:36:15,490 --> 00:36:20,090
my iphone is like I don't want to work
now meticulous well I think it's on the

613
00:36:20,090 --> 00:36:20,580
network

614
00:36:20,580 --> 00:36:23,779
we will see Runnemede attack number five

615
00:36:23,780 --> 00:36:27,310
test for the ball SSH password

616
00:36:27,310 --> 00:36:30,620
but it did give it the IP address which
the actually

617
00:36:30,620 --> 00:36:35,710
home by Peter

618
00:36:35,710 --> 00:36:38,890
yes it's still on the network it would
not have seen

619
00:36:38,890 --> 00:36:45,750
rude and surgeons such as password
otherwise a nine-hour

620
00:36:45,750 --> 00:36:51,920
and of course like anything air intake
them

621
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:56,260
okay my somebody just attacked my
parents went down

622
00:36:56,260 --> 00:37:02,390
connection reset by peer her as well you
know the deets

623
00:37:02,390 --> 00:37:07,350
but I knew I could trust you guys let me
wait until after the demand for Eastern

624
00:37:07,350 --> 00:37:08,350
bag in my star

625
00:37:08,350 --> 00:37:12,230
what am I talking about this is who this
isn't black cat

626
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:16,060
them alright remote attacked an mp4

627
00:37:16,060 --> 00:37:20,250
turnout was down my boyfriend will not
stop parking my was making these

628
00:37:20,250 --> 00:37:25,810
them

629
00:37:25,810 --> 00:37:29,759
all rights in our demo building for one
the last time I did those

630
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:33,320
people want to remove every day you know
I didn't directly answer

631
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:40,320
we can go out there and do an answer is
if you like

632
00:37:47,790 --> 00:37:52,450
thanks guys you guys killed my hmmm I
guess I told ET receptor

633
00:37:52,450 --> 00:37:58,900
him

634
00:37:58,900 --> 00:38:02,179
who would actually doing is trying our
client a lawyer in

635
00:38:02,179 --> 00:38:06,959
and once that works not very good
resolution under

636
00:38:06,959 --> 00:38:10,169
what it does is it is about one works
and then if it does

637
00:38:10,169 --> 00:38:14,118
it as 30 p.m. into it and uploaded agent

638
00:38:14,119 --> 00:38:17,499
iPhone not know and installed it and

639
00:38:17,499 --> 00:38:21,409
if it works it says indeed it is
vulnerable and the dunes on agents and

640
00:38:21,409 --> 00:38:21,900
there's now an

641
00:38:21,900 --> 00:38:25,189
agent on iphone well there's nothing on
the divers a picture

642
00:38:25,189 --> 00:38:28,368
cat I don't even have will act now

643
00:38:28,369 --> 00:38:32,239
good job honey which room is really good
I'm

644
00:38:32,239 --> 00:38:35,400
delivered to go on because

645
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:40,609
huh well I'm tell my customers

646
00:38:40,609 --> 00:38:45,799
no I'm not scary I'm home not vulnerable
there in a minute while I went on

647
00:38:45,799 --> 00:38:49,199
Tuesday I didn't hear the my IP address
and it is destroyed it

648
00:38:49,199 --> 00:38:52,279
develop yes

649
00:38:52,279 --> 00:38:56,269
how do you know how bad I want the
iPhone four point to remind you

650
00:38:56,269 --> 00:38:59,409
what's no our users probably have at

651
00:38:59,409 --> 00:39:03,109
so you can you tell your users as well
yes it is exploitable

652
00:39:03,109 --> 00:39:07,078
on stage all right here

653
00:39:07,079 --> 00:39:12,859
must do a demo that works with a 6-0 to
go back

654
00:39:12,859 --> 00:39:17,229
let's run a social and very attack not
make sure all amor

655
00:39:17,229 --> 00:39:23,359
me laters want to respond as soon as is
so this is our guy with the agent should

656
00:39:23,359 --> 00:39:25,788
already be gone but would only be a jerk
right now

657
00:39:25,789 --> 00:39:32,409
and this is our is going to be our
victim

658
00:39:32,409 --> 00:39:36,689
her answer now run a civil engineering
our clients I'll attack number six

659
00:39:36,689 --> 00:39:42,098
find you a client side show my country
my only one in there that would kill

660
00:39:42,099 --> 00:39:44,549
against Android we're gonna burst but
Moran is

661
00:39:44,549 --> 00:39:48,469
little model to run it so we just port
in more ex-wives and he will give us

662
00:39:48,469 --> 00:39:49,380
more options

663
00:39:49,380 --> 00:39:53,079
by wanna put it somewhere

664
00:39:53,079 --> 00:39:57,799
them for her from even a file name

665
00:39:57,799 --> 00:40:00,939
them for her doubted him now

666
00:40:00,939 --> 00:40:05,719
no actually put that on the web server
for us and go number to attack

667
00:40:05,719 --> 00:40:12,719
of

668
00:40:13,350 --> 00:40:15,589
underneath everything works correctly

669
00:40:15,590 --> 00:40:20,260
we should get the text message ever hear
anarchy were no

670
00:40:20,260 --> 00:40:25,040
work hmmm

671
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:28,490
very here so what actually happened to
that used the mobile modem

672
00:40:28,490 --> 00:40:31,720
if you have more than one mobile modem
international give you an option do you

673
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:34,230
wanna use lift the moment mobile modem

674
00:40:34,230 --> 00:40:38,260
so actually sent from my I 5554

675
00:40:38,260 --> 00:40:41,980
so eight years that mobile modem inside
on the smartphone or iPad

676
00:40:41,980 --> 00:40:47,280
do so wanna be down here descended and
its here's the link this is a cool page

677
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:48,380
please go to this

678
00:40:48,380 --> 00:40:51,930
no I naturally leader might go cool free
stuff from Target

679
00:40:51,930 --> 00:40:55,089
it and indeed actually

680
00:40:55,090 --> 00:40:59,080
going to go to that page which can't be
WebKit exploit which

681
00:40:59,080 --> 00:41:04,100
again is like most brother exploit not
100 percent of them all the time because

682
00:41:04,100 --> 00:41:05,620
it actually as the peeps bright

683
00:41:05,620 --> 00:41:09,839
so we'll see if it works and it does
take a minute

684
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:13,160
to heaps prayer special manipulator so

685
00:41:13,160 --> 00:41:20,160
basically once the brother dies will see
the word by you can do it

686
00:41:20,770 --> 00:41:27,770
them

687
00:41:29,110 --> 00:41:34,870
mentirosa dad time

688
00:41:34,870 --> 00:41:38,759
ferrier all rights and brother died so
chances are we're

689
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:42,530
now didn't get a shower

690
00:41:42,530 --> 00:41:49,530
was unfortunate sternum

691
00:41:55,130 --> 00:41:58,690
least one among them is as the word I
never do live demos I have the excuse

692
00:41:58,690 --> 00:42:02,040
that having smartphones is like holding
a camera this Martin and they've that's

693
00:42:02,040 --> 00:42:02,680
really hard

694
00:42:02,680 --> 00:42:05,730
my old issues emulators like midnight
their owners

695
00:42:05,730 --> 00:42:12,470
but I did not sacrifice anything to the
demagogues morning I obviously should

696
00:42:12,470 --> 00:42:14,490
have our

697
00:42:14,490 --> 00:42:19,590
barrio or to achieve that it was just
right now I'm it discloses the shell we

698
00:42:19,590 --> 00:42:21,880
can have to give the shelter the user's
well

699
00:42:21,880 --> 00:42:25,200
who basically it is open the shell runs
one commanded the

700
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:29,870
you I desire sons were either web
browser we r ur

701
00:42:29,870 --> 00:42:33,029
we are apt number two which is the
browser on this

702
00:42:33,030 --> 00:42:37,600
Android emulator and as good as the
challenge yes they were Boehner more

703
00:42:37,600 --> 00:42:40,970
so we did have a demo work on the second
round but still

704
00:42:40,970 --> 00:42:45,120
yeah on heard

705
00:42:45,120 --> 00:42:48,730
alright so let's see what else can we do
it is

706
00:42:48,730 --> 00:42:52,510
what's do attach it to an actual agen

707
00:42:52,510 --> 00:42:59,220
I was gonna tad too wanna Rd the border

708
00:42:59,220 --> 00:43:03,730
well as give it the agent's phone number
the phone number and the controller

709
00:43:03,730 --> 00:43:05,160
which is going to be

710
00:43:05,160 --> 00:43:08,220
my mobile modem

711
00:43:08,220 --> 00:43:11,860
the URL path forward checked in this is
all hardcore

712
00:43:11,860 --> 00:43:15,220
coated in the region itself like insider
eclipse

713
00:43:15,220 --> 00:43:19,820
known who want a Mac Mini when this is
all over her

714
00:43:19,820 --> 00:43:23,390
and then again the control key which
again can be

715
00:43:23,390 --> 00:43:28,580
ne7 did key it doesn't have to be key he
won it doesn't have to be the same as

716
00:43:28,580 --> 00:43:32,880
does the same thing we use for this the
smartphone app beginning be different as

717
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:34,950
long as the same in the agent and

718
00:43:34,950 --> 00:43:39,790
the framework and we tell it the
platforms is going to be and remain

719
00:43:39,790 --> 00:43:46,740
yes this is correct make sure it is
running it should have started

720
00:43:46,740 --> 00:43:51,250
let's just make sure him

721
00:43:51,250 --> 00:43:54,290
and then let's see if we can send
commands your agent

722
00:43:54,290 --> 00:43:57,529
know we currently only have one in an
attack

723
00:43:57,530 --> 00:44:01,690
there we can send an SMS to a concern
aftermath somebody else would have to

724
00:44:01,690 --> 00:44:03,040
take a picture

725
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:08,240
and upload it to on that doesn't work on
every version Android or he doesn't have

726
00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:09,330
a camera old

727
00:44:09,330 --> 00:44:14,299
it'll fail nicely and tell you where the
air is we get all the contacts from it

728
00:44:14,300 --> 00:44:18,320
which doesn't work on emulators that
will work on your regular phone we can

729
00:44:18,320 --> 00:44:22,120
get the SMS database I currently have
just getting the last 10 as the masses

730
00:44:22,120 --> 00:44:27,380
that's a really big while I manicure
privilege escalation attack against at

731
00:44:27,380 --> 00:44:32,120
so do big picture and delivery method

732
00:44:32,120 --> 00:44:35,330
we can either have risen over the mobile
modem or added

733
00:44:35,330 --> 00:44:40,049
send over HTTP Server one address where
we told it to check in at

734
00:44:40,050 --> 00:44:43,410
that IP address and then Mike enter 81

735
00:44:43,410 --> 00:44:47,060
that's worth checking in does this do a
GDP we haven't seen that yet

736
00:44:47,060 --> 00:44:51,290
another gonna run in the background and
we'll look at the day race and see if it

737
00:44:51,290 --> 00:44:52,700
works in a minute had

738
00:44:52,700 --> 00:44:55,930
it done we can't have that agents and
things checkin

739
00:44:55,930 --> 00:44:59,529
every couple seconds are in about 10
minutes as good

740
00:44:59,530 --> 00:45:02,960
don't have time for questions we can
have a check in all the time

741
00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:06,110
now run on your battery as what botnets
run into

742
00:45:06,110 --> 00:45:09,740
view chechyan like every second with the
stuff started I'm

743
00:45:09,740 --> 00:45:13,150
users hate it when their batteries run
down so I actually have a checking every

744
00:45:13,150 --> 00:45:14,490
30 seconds right now

745
00:45:14,490 --> 00:45:19,320
him

746
00:45:19,320 --> 00:45:23,320
in 2002 get back few information
