1
00:00:07,009 --> 00:00:09,210
Arshi list all the couple more seconds

2
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:14,150
it's the phone in my pocket props

3
00:00:14,150 --> 00:00:21,150
any

4
00:00:23,540 --> 00:00:30,540
C

5
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:34,720
ok amitai septa just a little bit more I
might be tempting fate

6
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:41,570
much

7
00:00:41,570 --> 00:00:45,690
go keep on waiting list of Kamal

8
00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:52,690
not only 1i like touch it's a change
slides now so this is going to be the

9
00:00:57,020 --> 00:00:57,770
only slide

10
00:00:57,770 --> 00:01:02,900
we see the entire time yeah yeah

11
00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:06,720
turn it off and on again okay

12
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:11,560
iight so I'm

13
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:16,680
yeah I i'm I kinda looking over there
cuz its weird looking at the screen so I

14
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:17,920
might switch between

15
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:22,560
so yeah I'm David Dunning I go by handle
run and on this is my first time

16
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:26,030
at hope so I'm really excited about the
weekend and stuff and it seems a really

17
00:01:26,030 --> 00:01:26,850
cool crowd

18
00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:31,259
and I'm gonna talk today about that the
hideous methods up keystroke injection

19
00:01:31,259 --> 00:01:34,470
so what is Kisha injection

20
00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:38,560
I it's the emulation other keyboard so
it's without actually having the

21
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:42,250
physical keyboard they are using
something else to emulate the signals

22
00:01:42,250 --> 00:01:43,009
that are sent

23
00:01:43,009 --> 00:01:46,430
that interpreted by a computer as key
keys

24
00:01:46,430 --> 00:01:50,840
so it's like you a press a key I'm
benefits of leveraging this on my talk

25
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:53,120
about this from a security perspective
as

26
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:56,159
kinda and testing and using this as sort
of a an attack

27
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:59,320
I method so some the benefits of using

28
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:03,630
you know it hit injection site a head is
human interface device

29
00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:07,960
I might rotate between those terms cuz
it is kind of like a larger scope as a

30
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:09,780
lot and hid devices out there

31
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:13,070
and they'd often use keystrokes

32
00:02:13,070 --> 00:02:17,459
but they're not considered a keyboard so
hit injection is probably more accurate

33
00:02:17,459 --> 00:02:20,390
way of stating and that's what I
normally use

34
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:23,870
in my lingo I'm so yeah type accurately

35
00:02:23,870 --> 00:02:28,120
you can pre program it so you gonna set
tell it what to do I you can type very

36
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:28,930
very quickly

37
00:02:28,930 --> 00:02:32,760
on you can type way faster than most
operating systems can handle

38
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:37,030
and in my demos I'm using VirtualBox oh
this is a buffering there

39
00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:40,989
and so you can use sometimes up to slow
it down but you type very quickly and

40
00:02:40,989 --> 00:02:41,670
accurately

41
00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:44,910
ominous require human by that I mean
nobody's

42
00:02:44,910 --> 00:02:48,670
at a keyboard you don't have to be there
to make something happen you can

43
00:02:48,670 --> 00:02:52,770
you know talkin something and then not
be there it injects later on

44
00:02:52,770 --> 00:02:56,290
I works against all a lot of computer so
that a

45
00:02:56,290 --> 00:02:59,569
benefit that it you know what computers
use a keyboard

46
00:02:59,569 --> 00:03:02,610
most def stop you know let desktops
laptops are

47
00:03:02,610 --> 00:03:06,160
are via phones and you know PDA's every

48
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:09,160
do but I don't has anybody ever tried to
hook up

49
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:13,420
a USB keyboard to I found out that
sounds crazy

50
00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:16,430
yeah up oh yeah as they work holler

51
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:19,810
yeah nice so you got on the N 900

52
00:03:19,810 --> 00:03:25,190
yeah so not going to rant about that
call this in another town phone is good

53
00:03:25,190 --> 00:03:28,250
stuff but it's got USB host mode so you
can plug things into it

54
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:32,360
how which most devices don't it's really
only call for

55
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:35,190
this kinda crowd in a super like why
would i hook back keyboard up to my

56
00:03:35,190 --> 00:03:35,730
phone

57
00:03:35,730 --> 00:03:40,670
because you can hook you up here how
come on people

58
00:03:40,670 --> 00:03:42,260
a cell

59
00:03:42,260 --> 00:03:45,359
most likely not on that but you know yet
says this specific

60
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:49,560
run talking about today I targeted
Windows Linux and OSX

61
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:53,240
which are you know the most common
desktop laptop platforms

62
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:56,730
I'm probably not in that order
unfortunately not in that order

63
00:03:56,730 --> 00:04:00,790
so it is hideous

64
00:04:00,790 --> 00:04:05,750
its human interface device which is here
to injection over USB sweet

65
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:09,110
has yet to come out with school come
some cool acronym

66
00:04:09,110 --> 00:04:13,670
I it's a library for keystroke injection
its design for the Arduino platform

67
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:17,120
so you're gonna be leveraging are doing
a type hardware for this

68
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:21,680
I reads payloads from micro SD card
which is different from some the other

69
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:25,990
projects that are out there I so you
don't have to you all the configuration

70
00:04:25,990 --> 00:04:26,600
is done

71
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:30,450
by the user on the micro SD card which
makes it for the convenience

72
00:04:30,450 --> 00:04:34,539
and the users like cameras on the fly
with that dip switch so you can change

73
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:35,800
between payloads

74
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:39,520
without having to do you know you just
at a moment's notice you can decide you

75
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:40,710
want to run something else

76
00:04:40,710 --> 00:04:45,880
in what he had previously planned so are
the different payloads

77
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:48,990
com said they're loaded on the micro SD
card

78
00:04:48,990 --> 00:04:52,390
most of them are plain text files that
you have set up

79
00:04:52,390 --> 00:04:56,360
and these are using configure textiles
you don't nothing is preset in there

80
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:59,910
the operating systems when does the next
hour sacks

81
00:04:59,910 --> 00:05:03,690
arm so they this payloads work
differently on each one

82
00:05:03,690 --> 00:05:06,710
see you think a typing is in the same
but the way these payloads are going to

83
00:05:06,710 --> 00:05:07,159
work

84
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:11,410
they axe differently depending on the
operating system to make it convenient

85
00:05:11,410 --> 00:05:12,419
for the user

86
00:05:12,419 --> 00:05:17,609
so the types that payloads I have set up
I brought a laser pointer with me I left

87
00:05:17,610 --> 00:05:18,350
it downstairs

88
00:05:18,350 --> 00:05:22,020
really on a laser point anybody in the
crowd

89
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:25,390
out of class library just doesn't do the
same

90
00:05:25,390 --> 00:05:30,380
now now now that's amazing can leave now
it has a laser pointer

91
00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:34,790
here ten years to hate come on alright
so

92
00:05:34,790 --> 00:05:38,000
I the different types the payload that I
have configured in this library

93
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:44,439
oh yeah

94
00:05:44,439 --> 00:05:47,370
awesome I got to light one with other
okay

95
00:05:47,370 --> 00:05:51,300
core I am so for the people at home that
are obviously saying when I'm pointing

96
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:56,229
I so commands a script binary and
something called red button that are

97
00:05:56,229 --> 00:05:59,270
discussed so this is a paleo that's
going to be one command

98
00:05:59,270 --> 00:06:03,710
I or s verses scripts or a binary
execute all

99
00:06:03,710 --> 00:06:07,859
read that so all about the selection
process

100
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:11,030
I am as I said you're going to use the
dip tip is that switched

101
00:06:11,030 --> 00:06:14,750
to go between them I I decided to
incorporate a safe mode

102
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:17,979
because this is launching stuff when
it's plugged NC you want that

103
00:06:17,979 --> 00:06:22,719
as a developer I realize that you wanted
not to do that stuff sometimes

104
00:06:22,719 --> 00:06:26,440
so when I have minutes that slipped a
binary 0

105
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:29,830
it's not gonna do anything that is the
safe code you know you employed and your

106
00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:30,490
computer

107
00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:33,539
then I if it's an wine

108
00:06:33,539 --> 00:06:36,509
minutes can type out help because I
figured there's a lot of possible

109
00:06:36,509 --> 00:06:37,930
modules there and you might not

110
00:06:37,930 --> 00:06:41,379
have that you know you mind I wanna take
out the SD card unplug it and look

111
00:06:41,379 --> 00:06:42,169
through that so

112
00:06:42,169 --> 00:06:45,770
how the modules work theirself
encapsulated

113
00:06:45,770 --> 00:06:49,080
so you have a folder South like that
that's advances have a folder and all

114
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:50,599
the files are in there that you're gonna

115
00:06:50,599 --> 00:06:54,378
other resources that you need I wanted a
spouse help da txt

116
00:06:54,379 --> 00:06:57,710
and that's just the description you want
to give that particular module up

117
00:06:57,710 --> 00:07:00,979
what it's gonna deal so this reads
through all those folders and just print

118
00:07:00,979 --> 00:07:02,699
that out for you to make it convenient

119
00:07:02,699 --> 00:07:06,319
and the rest the modules are these
payloads that you're going to inject

120
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:07,279
onto the system

121
00:07:07,279 --> 00:07:12,050
these user-defined to the terminal is
key here

122
00:07:12,050 --> 00:07:15,469
I and are I'll talk a little bit more
about

123
00:07:15,469 --> 00:07:18,680
you know we we generally think mine said
you need the mouse

124
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:22,599
to interact we all interact with the
mouse to do you stop high everyday life

125
00:07:22,599 --> 00:07:23,349
I

126
00:07:23,349 --> 00:07:26,490
as I've done this project try to
interact more less and less to the mouse

127
00:07:26,490 --> 00:07:27,229
just to see

128
00:07:27,229 --> 00:07:30,818
cuz you can really get almost everything
done on your computer

129
00:07:30,819 --> 00:07:34,289
are you can unplug your mouse and see
how your day goes and you can

130
00:07:34,289 --> 00:07:38,349
if you have you know some help into how
the keys work you can pretty much do

131
00:07:38,349 --> 00:07:40,000
everything you are doing before

132
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,949
without mouse entirely upon a mouse
interacting with that the GUI interface

133
00:07:43,949 --> 00:07:44,810
not talking like

134
00:07:44,810 --> 00:07:49,039
using a terminal only you can interact
with the the system

135
00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:52,060
so but I'm on leveraging the terminal to
start out with

136
00:07:52,060 --> 00:07:55,630
so the payloads are going to be run as I
mentioned that the scripts are gonna be

137
00:07:55,630 --> 00:07:57,199
run obviously in a terminal

138
00:07:57,199 --> 00:08:00,569
I most of them and there's one that's
not that I talk about later

139
00:08:00,569 --> 00:08:05,000
ought to control so the functions that
I've written

140
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,149
go ahead and open up terminal for you to
make it easy you don't have to know

141
00:08:08,149 --> 00:08:09,789
these keystrokes open that up

142
00:08:09,789 --> 00:08:13,190
you just pass it parameters and it says
I my starting point

143
00:08:13,190 --> 00:08:16,779
is I will though to terminal for you and
then I'm going to run

144
00:08:16,779 --> 00:08:20,620
these payloads that you've set free so
it's going to use the graphical

145
00:08:20,620 --> 00:08:21,469
interface

146
00:08:21,469 --> 00:08:25,370
to open a terminal in Windows I have it
go through and you

147
00:08:25,370 --> 00:08:28,880
run and administrative time and also
most the time you had administrative

148
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:29,690
access

149
00:08:29,690 --> 00:08:33,219
when you open it I relies on a popup
that says are you sure you are on this

150
00:08:33,219 --> 00:08:33,969
is admin

151
00:08:33,969 --> 00:08:38,649
which donna's viruses they can click on
things but when you are designed to hit

152
00:08:38,649 --> 00:08:39,289
entire

153
00:08:39,289 --> 00:08:43,390
as a keyboard that's a oh yeah I was
difficult to bypass let me hit enter

154
00:08:43,390 --> 00:08:46,560
so I yeah you can just say it happens up

155
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:50,040
administrative one I is harder to do and
you know

156
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:54,670
Mexico a sexy after seato and most
likely they have permissions and stuff

157
00:08:54,670 --> 00:08:55,050
so

158
00:08:55,050 --> 00:08:58,810
that's an option out there but I didn't
implement that as they know

159
00:08:58,810 --> 00:09:01,940
baseline so then you know once the
terminals up

160
00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:05,430
you have the minister privileges it's
going to run these payloads that you

161
00:09:05,430 --> 00:09:09,290
configured yet the command line 1

162
00:09:09,290 --> 00:09:12,349
I so runs on one line in the command
line

163
00:09:12,350 --> 00:09:16,930
but it's not necessarily one commands
sanibel have typed in more than one

164
00:09:16,930 --> 00:09:18,569
command on a command-line

165
00:09:18,569 --> 00:09:22,920
at once you know i'm talking about. okay
good break a so this is exactly a

166
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:27,140
com you have you can use the ampersand
or the senate call and and

167
00:09:27,140 --> 00:09:30,370
they have Man X and Windows I am to

168
00:09:30,370 --> 00:09:33,850
to add additional commander says after
this once finished

169
00:09:33,850 --> 00:09:36,750
run this one and after that once
finished from this one or run these two

170
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:39,660
together if this one fails le different
combinations you can do you

171
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:43,060
just with one line it you I i've seen

172
00:09:43,060 --> 00:09:46,360
some people that are really good at you
know night in writing scripts cuz they

173
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:50,800
can write everything they would be in a
script in one really long long line

174
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:54,910
and it's really really hard to read by
it's like once you really like that is

175
00:09:54,910 --> 00:09:57,279
really cool that is just of it you know
1 line UK

176
00:09:57,279 --> 00:10:02,029
entire and can do all that stuff so you
can actually get a lot done just with a

177
00:10:02,029 --> 00:10:02,610
single

178
00:10:02,610 --> 00:10:07,199
command line and its and sometimes
easier few put that together

179
00:10:07,199 --> 00:10:11,420
on next time easy so a big part of that
pain injection is you need to you

180
00:10:11,420 --> 00:10:14,740
predict how the environment's going to
react because you you're not getting

181
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:16,089
feedback you're saying

182
00:10:16,089 --> 00:10:19,470
going to doing things you know how long
is it going to take

183
00:10:19,470 --> 00:10:22,510
with a single command you bring up a
command prompt you run it and it's you

184
00:10:22,510 --> 00:10:24,930
know it's going to do its thing and you
don't care what happens after that

185
00:10:24,930 --> 00:10:26,760
you've you've got all the timing

186
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:30,279
is built and because you're running that
one line I

187
00:10:30,279 --> 00:10:32,910
so there's not and is often only the
right thing to do this like the others

188
00:10:32,910 --> 00:10:35,640
who you just run the command so it's
gonna do that stuff

189
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:38,870
and then at the end I have it exit the
terminal once you finish so

190
00:10:38,870 --> 00:10:43,660
does stuff these that terminal and then
you know basically nobody's the wiser

191
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:47,160
a lot of this is trying to be nobody's
the wiser unseen

192
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:50,880
hidden detection you're trying to get
a.m. these injections to work while

193
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:53,900
nobody is observing

194
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:57,100
disc expecting a look things a little
easier I'm sure there's a lot people who

195
00:10:57,100 --> 00:10:57,620
use

196
00:10:57,620 --> 00:11:02,510
scripts in here and wheeze in their
daily lives were thinking they have the

197
00:11:02,510 --> 00:11:06,170
basic language is that we use as a tack
platforms as a lot you can do with a

198
00:11:06,170 --> 00:11:07,689
bash script

199
00:11:07,689 --> 00:11:10,620
you can destroy system with the basket
really easily or you can gain

200
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:12,870
information just with the local

201
00:11:12,870 --> 00:11:16,860
resources so I type base we opened the
Tylenol

202
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:20,430
types it into an editor I used it I
originally developed with at it

203
00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:24,699
which is another 16 bit old command in
Windows which was awesome are so proud

204
00:11:24,699 --> 00:11:27,430
as I cannot believe the command prompt
to do this

205
00:11:27,430 --> 00:11:31,959
and then I tried on at 64 bit version of
Windows and I was like what is that

206
00:11:31,959 --> 00:11:37,230
6 it's like you all I was so proud that
have two years now had and it's like

207
00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:38,209
well

208
00:11:38,209 --> 00:11:42,470
crap at ease net that so this accident
in Notepad and

209
00:11:42,470 --> 00:11:46,600
and when does and then in the terminal
and in Linux and OSX

210
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:50,010
but to type sedan saves it runs it

211
00:11:50,010 --> 00:11:54,309
delete it so this is on again like I
long command but it's gonna save it in a

212
00:11:54,309 --> 00:11:55,660
temporary directory

213
00:11:55,660 --> 00:12:00,069
run it and then delete it once it's done
kinda alotta this but I designers at

214
00:12:00,069 --> 00:12:01,020
self-cleaning

215
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:05,380
so you do you know your your stuff and
then by the end it's it's

216
00:12:05,380 --> 00:12:09,809
gone not talking like hardcore friends
expected to the naked eye it's pretty

217
00:12:09,809 --> 00:12:10,569
much gone

218
00:12:10,569 --> 00:12:14,390
you know never existed offer you can use
yeah

219
00:12:14,390 --> 00:12:17,559
leveraging native scripting languages a
lot of what we want to do with head

220
00:12:17,559 --> 00:12:18,520
injection

221
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:21,920
is it is use the resources that are
there unlike you know if you're going to

222
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:24,349
be downloading an application or like a

223
00:12:24,350 --> 00:12:27,500
using like matar paneer something
anything in like the back door shell

224
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:31,890
I am yet that get that on the box we're
not putting necessarily to have to put

225
00:12:31,890 --> 00:12:32,740
anything

226
00:12:32,740 --> 00:12:37,110
any new software on here at all so we're
using what's already on there

227
00:12:37,110 --> 00:12:40,540
the only difference between how I
Romney's is you know it's either

228
00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:44,020
dot Fort slash or Python spacer

229
00:12:44,020 --> 00:12:47,380
that's the only reason they're all its
gonna be da points last I would be fine

230
00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:48,459
and running in latex

231
00:12:48,459 --> 00:12:51,740
or you know bash 5 just wanna type in
the file name hair

232
00:12:51,740 --> 00:12:54,920
so they're run a little bit differently
which is why list them out there

233
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:59,380
as a post saying all scripting languages
but you know if people want to add more

234
00:12:59,380 --> 00:13:00,140
it's just for

235
00:13:00,140 --> 00:13:03,699
like one line of code me to say okay now
I support Ruby

236
00:13:03,699 --> 00:13:07,689
or another language so it'll be really
easy for me to update that

237
00:13:07,689 --> 00:13:11,740
I am later on but I and you have more
advanced options

238
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:16,730
I the at the single command

239
00:13:16,730 --> 00:13:22,240
a binary you can run the ideas you've
got a binary in your flash drive in your

240
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:25,779
lawn to execute on the hosts a sum that
the target system

241
00:13:25,779 --> 00:13:29,829
so how do you do that all the scripts
that I use across the board on is

242
00:13:29,829 --> 00:13:31,000
operating systems

243
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,920
read an the a binary

244
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:39,829
and and then compared to hexadecimal
format then type that hexadecimal format

245
00:13:39,829 --> 00:13:44,079
into the system and the command my nerd
and now pat or whatever

246
00:13:44,079 --> 00:13:47,470
and then convert that back into a binary
and then run the binary and then delete

247
00:13:47,470 --> 00:13:48,790
the

248
00:13:48,790 --> 00:13:53,219
which is really cool sounding a is
really cool accepted its super slow

249
00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:57,550
because if you try to convert a binary
and hex it takes forever

250
00:13:57,550 --> 00:14:01,510
as I mentioned before the device can ken
type in

251
00:14:01,510 --> 00:14:05,339
way faster than the computers to handle
so there's always I have to like

252
00:14:05,339 --> 00:14:08,809
writing a lag times you have too much
stuff and wait for the computer to catch

253
00:14:08,809 --> 00:14:11,709
up but i dont stuff so ends up taking

254
00:14:11,709 --> 00:14:15,290
a long time for even like Notepad EXE or

255
00:14:15,290 --> 00:14:19,980
really small you know netcat typing your
neck at takes a lot you have

256
00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:23,819
a couple hours and that then you know
it's a really a high-end

257
00:14:23,819 --> 00:14:27,610
networking security system IDS IPS what
are those blocking you from getting

258
00:14:27,610 --> 00:14:30,640
anything out on the box and that's the
way of doing it

259
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:35,260
okay but otherwise it's there it might
be fun to play around with once or twice

260
00:14:35,260 --> 00:14:39,260
by it's going to be really a lot slower
than just using a script to download

261
00:14:39,260 --> 00:14:42,620
something and then run it for you

262
00:14:42,620 --> 00:14:47,089
but the seven take the most time to
implement broadcasting

263
00:14:47,089 --> 00:14:52,209
I red button never use red button

264
00:14:52,209 --> 00:14:55,589
so what I i decided to do was like I'll

265
00:14:55,589 --> 00:14:59,150
wanna skip I want something that's
basically going to do randomly wreak

266
00:14:59,150 --> 00:14:59,780
havoc

267
00:14:59,780 --> 00:15:04,000
on the system because you know sometimes
I get bored in the project you're

268
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,860
working on like I want to add something
new and fun

269
00:15:06,860 --> 00:15:10,209
so I thought what i'd like the worst
things you can do randomizing with the

270
00:15:10,209 --> 00:15:11,270
keyword so

271
00:15:11,270 --> 00:15:14,610
it does a mass movement in a random
direction I

272
00:15:14,610 --> 00:15:18,250
it all click a random mouse button so
the three mouse button right click menu

273
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:21,000
click left think it'll be one of those
randomly

274
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:25,110
I'll randomly hit the geeky so and when
does the guy he is like the start open

275
00:15:25,110 --> 00:15:26,419
the Start menu

276
00:15:26,419 --> 00:15:30,620
and then at all hit a rose up and down
and then hit enter

277
00:15:30,620 --> 00:15:34,089
it all open up the command lot that the
run command

278
00:15:34,089 --> 00:15:37,220
in when is like to hit all are in your
head that they'll run

279
00:15:37,220 --> 00:15:41,390
ill do that it'll type in now sigh it
does the start menu to the start menu

280
00:15:41,390 --> 00:15:45,409
types into characters wait a second for
one is to recommend something and then

281
00:15:45,409 --> 00:15:47,679
had dinner

282
00:15:47,679 --> 00:15:53,030
that's what I would like so it launches
random applications the guilty one is a

283
00:15:53,030 --> 00:15:56,770
think it runs a random command I am and

284
00:15:56,770 --> 00:15:59,880
so it's also a random timing between all
of this so it's going away

285
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:03,559
I think it's like between wind and 10
seconds

286
00:16:03,559 --> 00:16:07,719
for all these things ago on so del
accidentally have this right on my

287
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:09,150
computer wont San

288
00:16:09,150 --> 00:16:12,329
you know I walked away with the pattern
came back and just like all these doubts

289
00:16:12,329 --> 00:16:15,020
are off nothing was running everything
was frozen

290
00:16:15,020 --> 00:16:18,350
like this is a cool way I should should
implement this

291
00:16:18,350 --> 00:16:21,929
so I it's there its and it's a function
you can call

292
00:16:21,929 --> 00:16:25,819
the one thing a reason that it actually
might be useful

293
00:16:25,819 --> 00:16:29,909
is if you're trying to break at a kiosk
you have access

294
00:16:29,909 --> 00:16:32,949
to USB to a kiosk or some other do you

295
00:16:32,949 --> 00:16:36,220
then you know i i but yes to me like a
public computer that's you know got an

296
00:16:36,220 --> 00:16:38,329
interface that's not like when does it

297
00:16:38,329 --> 00:16:42,169
you may be able to click around our
search their website or whatever

298
00:16:42,169 --> 00:16:45,809
a lot of times I am one of my hobbies is
breaking out chaos

299
00:16:45,809 --> 00:16:49,089
and South either be really cool because
a lot of times you can end up doing and

300
00:16:49,089 --> 00:16:50,459
if you spend enough time

301
00:16:50,459 --> 00:16:53,880
so the goal of this is it gonna click
around and try every key combination

302
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:55,030
possibly think I've

303
00:16:55,030 --> 00:16:59,339
and it's either gonna crash the thing or
probably battle its way out eventually

304
00:16:59,339 --> 00:17:03,169
so you can apply can walk away come back
and see if it's in the crash to broken

305
00:17:03,169 --> 00:17:03,610
out our

306
00:17:03,610 --> 00:17:07,370
what's happened maybe do it a couple
different times but on

307
00:17:07,370 --> 00:17:11,439
or you know it's a fun prank hey a
plug-in walkway come back in

308
00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:14,620
your computer can be completely to Bart
like

309
00:17:14,620 --> 00:17:17,880
it can really really meh some stuff up

310
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:22,419
so that's why red I am so I mention
there's one exceptions are running

311
00:17:22,419 --> 00:17:23,740
native scripts

312
00:17:23,740 --> 00:17:27,829
I wrote something called the hits kept
it's out at a parsed Langlands

313
00:17:27,829 --> 00:17:31,440
side to a disaccharide a language good
it's really not a lot of the language

314
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:32,100
issue I just

315
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:36,610
parsing some syntax and also you can
sample see no I'm talking about

316
00:17:36,610 --> 00:17:40,640
so running Python and basket thing and
stuff that's cool

317
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:44,460
but it's harder to interact with the
Gilly doing that

318
00:17:44,460 --> 00:17:47,770
unless you are an awesome how many all
think they can do that in Python like

319
00:17:47,770 --> 00:17:48,789
how many people

320
00:17:48,789 --> 00:17:51,919
have the skill to run a lot of the stuff
for like pearl or something

321
00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:55,309
that UN like to you emulate a keyboard
click

322
00:17:55,309 --> 00:18:00,168
and a those languages I'm ask I really
did look it up and I figured

323
00:18:00,169 --> 00:18:03,679
ask a broad crowd was easier than me
searching online thats

324
00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:07,530
does the laziest there the senate out
there okay so maybe maybe not

325
00:18:07,530 --> 00:18:10,559
I but %uh so I created this language

326
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:14,049
I it's parsed and it will all use the
keys that you're not

327
00:18:14,049 --> 00:18:17,080
able to type directly so like you can
type a

328
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:20,799
that's fine but when you how do you type
function

329
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:24,559
or and now f7 you can't like

330
00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:28,330
when you type in f7 and its red and it's
going to type out after 7

331
00:18:28,330 --> 00:18:32,389
if I can actually hit the f70 the
scripts kinda the answer to that so that

332
00:18:32,390 --> 00:18:35,240
when its part it's actually gonna hit
these keys that are mapped on your

333
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:35,970
keyboard

334
00:18:35,970 --> 00:18:40,299
and not just read it and as he is as
like ASCII tax

335
00:18:40,299 --> 00:18:44,799
so translate the script there are four
main components to its you have plane

336
00:18:44,799 --> 00:18:48,270
taxied don't have to use the scripting
language for everything

337
00:18:48,270 --> 00:18:51,309
in the middle when you wanna type in
like hello world just type in hello

338
00:18:51,309 --> 00:18:53,450
world the name you use the special keys

339
00:18:53,450 --> 00:18:58,230
at that point you can use the language I
there are special modifier keys like

340
00:18:58,230 --> 00:19:00,200
Control Alt Shift

341
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:03,370
see you hold them on their own they
don't they do much when you hit by

342
00:19:03,370 --> 00:19:07,840
control ass the combination of the two
you mean something significant

343
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:11,520
so you have a special modifier keys
there when they're in sequence with

344
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:14,860
either themselves or another key they
mean something outsell

345
00:19:14,860 --> 00:19:18,200
those are the more significant in
language yeah by the coldest regular

346
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:21,140
parsed key is all the other keys on the
keyboard when you get them they do

347
00:19:21,140 --> 00:19:21,919
something

348
00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:25,830
or they do something in combination with
the modifiers

349
00:19:25,830 --> 00:19:29,070
I'm gonna have a commands I am

350
00:19:29,070 --> 00:19:32,399
and i'll just demonstrate with that is
so this is an example

351
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:36,010
a other script right here very simple
basic

352
00:19:36,010 --> 00:19:39,870
and kinda gets all the points I was
talking about see have a command

353
00:19:39,870 --> 00:19:44,659
I a modifier key right here they're the
right geeky on the keyboard

354
00:19:44,659 --> 00:19:48,919
and then are them I know what that does

355
00:19:48,919 --> 00:19:53,020
run that starts the Run dialog in
Windows so another thing you know this

356
00:19:53,020 --> 00:19:54,870
is the command that I have right now

357
00:19:54,870 --> 00:19:58,309
I might probably add other commands it
gets more robust

358
00:19:58,309 --> 00:20:01,700
but it's the way command soul lotta this
as I mentioned boys

359
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:05,100
timing so the way command

360
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:08,210
it says right now it interprets that as
one seconds

361
00:20:08,210 --> 00:20:12,610
and I think I'm gonna change that to be
I milliseconds

362
00:20:12,610 --> 00:20:15,950
most the time when you're doing
something like this you want to be on

363
00:20:15,950 --> 00:20:18,120
the delay you know you're in this
environment

364
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:21,190
a second versus seconds doesn't really
matter

365
00:20:21,190 --> 00:20:24,250
but there might be exceptions to that I
did this to make easy cuz we normally

366
00:20:24,250 --> 00:20:26,070
think of something in a sec enemy

367
00:20:26,070 --> 00:20:30,139
thinking in milliseconds is weird in the
normally

368
00:20:30,140 --> 00:20:33,179
but I it makes a little more sense to
say for certain things like you know if

369
00:20:33,179 --> 00:20:33,890
your

370
00:20:33,890 --> 00:20:36,559
for instance if you're trying to do you
like a video game or something that's

371
00:20:36,559 --> 00:20:37,820
really quick pace

372
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:41,039
those kinda milliseconds might even
matter to to you know

373
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:45,190
operate your body and while you need is
no sexy do their stuff

374
00:20:45,190 --> 00:20:48,909
so I might end up changing that by
anyway that waits for one second so that

375
00:20:48,909 --> 00:20:50,090
the delay

376
00:20:50,090 --> 00:20:53,168
you know waiting for that the terminal
the popper the run command pop-up

377
00:20:53,169 --> 00:20:56,580
types in Notepad its enter

378
00:20:56,580 --> 00:20:59,899
weights two seconds for new iPad 2
pop-up

379
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:03,809
types and hello world it's an air and
then hits

380
00:21:03,809 --> 00:21:08,230
alt f4 which causes an application so
this is this is the head virgin at hello

381
00:21:08,230 --> 00:21:09,659
world

382
00:21:09,659 --> 00:21:13,590
I am so you have your regular keys here
that I get a regular he

383
00:21:13,590 --> 00:21:18,199
regular key I regular key and then
you're you're just plain text

384
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:21,980
and I you can actually have multiple
these like you hate Control Alt Delete

385
00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:24,270
sometimes use multi modifiers

386
00:21:24,270 --> 00:21:28,900
so all the key sequences are one-liners
any light on you when injected he like

387
00:21:28,900 --> 00:21:29,539
that

388
00:21:29,539 --> 00:21:34,549
I have it set to parse in one line it's
easy to parse Ancelotti easier to look

389
00:21:34,549 --> 00:21:36,309
act as if you had to look at

390
00:21:36,309 --> 00:21:39,559
typing it all out and it's just like
wraps around Earth randomly there it's

391
00:21:39,559 --> 00:21:41,309
going to be gobbledygook so

392
00:21:41,309 --> 00:21:44,830
you know I'm taking the a the Python
method in the kind of like saying you

393
00:21:44,830 --> 00:21:49,779
have to do with the certain things just
so it'll look better

394
00:21:49,779 --> 00:21:53,210
what this is my thing that's

395
00:21:53,210 --> 00:21:57,100
is the plaintext I like this is it right
there you put that in text file

396
00:21:57,100 --> 00:22:01,779
and it will interpret is asking what
language am I using so this is the

397
00:22:01,779 --> 00:22:02,730
language so

398
00:22:02,730 --> 00:22:06,190
so it's going to read in this as a flat
tax file

399
00:22:06,190 --> 00:22:10,130
and interpret bed that device out talk
about that a second actual device that

400
00:22:10,130 --> 00:22:10,760
I'm using

401
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:15,450
as I do we know best device so that the
devices reading this file

402
00:22:15,450 --> 00:22:19,529
from the SD card parsing it and then
reacting accordingly

403
00:22:19,529 --> 00:22:26,529
and producing those keystrokes yeah I
we're gonna get a couple denies

404
00:22:27,390 --> 00:22:31,740
so to make it easier I am after even
like putting the Alabama

405
00:22:31,740 --> 00:22:35,150
realize it's a pain to type out cuz you
have to the sick at

406
00:22:35,150 --> 00:22:39,179
is important on this also matches a
library that I'm

407
00:22:39,179 --> 00:22:43,110
leveraging to so is a easy to keep the
same

408
00:22:43,110 --> 00:22:46,179
I syntax as they did see had likey right

409
00:22:46,179 --> 00:22:50,490
do it I which is a lot to type out and
not get wrong all that needs to be

410
00:22:50,490 --> 00:22:51,649
uppercase

411
00:22:51,649 --> 00:22:55,570
arm this right now the problem is

412
00:22:55,570 --> 00:22:59,200
you can make a more robust language but
these microcontrollers are really not

413
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:00,759
designed to handle

414
00:23:00,759 --> 00:23:05,980
text his text takes a bite and a bite to
microcontrollers a lot of space

415
00:23:05,980 --> 00:23:09,869
we're talking like kilobytes like any by
programmers out there you need to work

416
00:23:09,869 --> 00:23:11,929
with less than a kilobyte a memory

417
00:23:11,929 --> 00:23:15,840
and if you type in anywhere document you
have on your system that you

418
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:20,590
turned a network I is probably more than
a kilobytes worth a plain ASCII text

419
00:23:20,590 --> 00:23:24,570
see you after really stripped down as
much as possible

420
00:23:24,570 --> 00:23:28,210
arm when restricted languages so I'm
taking it this way

421
00:23:28,210 --> 00:23:30,710
this looks a little too easy to read
because it could be uppercase lowercase

422
00:23:30,710 --> 00:23:33,399
I think in the end it be harder to look
at

423
00:23:33,399 --> 00:23:36,399
say my typing now that upper case is
something when I use you

424
00:23:36,399 --> 00:23:40,129
so I friend of mine put together I had
script generator

425
00:23:40,129 --> 00:23:43,340
which makes things a lot easier so the
point click

426
00:23:43,340 --> 00:23:47,199
web interface I it's written in HTML and
Java

427
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:50,259
and I when we talked about I
specifically wanted Natsu

428
00:23:50,259 --> 00:23:54,279
rely on the backend server so I didn't
have to host the site and I didn't wanna

429
00:23:54,279 --> 00:23:54,759
have to

430
00:23:54,759 --> 00:23:58,059
have people go online to do it so having
AC Milan Java

431
00:23:58,059 --> 00:24:01,399
will run natively in your browser you
just double-click on the file in her

432
00:24:01,399 --> 00:24:05,820
run so it runs a browser does not suffer
back and at the copy and paste so it'll

433
00:24:05,820 --> 00:24:07,600
generate what you wanted to see

434
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:10,889
and then you can copy and paste that
into you the text file and that's my

435
00:24:10,889 --> 00:24:17,889
first demo

436
00:24:19,779 --> 00:24:23,970
I want to meet a lot up here but that's
not gonna happen cable

437
00:24:23,970 --> 00:24:27,000
donna britt heavy so I

438
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,990
shifting over their little bit this is
what it looks like now this was like

439
00:24:29,990 --> 00:24:30,750
this is the

440
00:24:30,750 --> 00:24:34,000
beta version now the how it looks this
is this is functional

441
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:38,210
Anne out color schemes are fine whatever
three simple

442
00:24:38,210 --> 00:24:41,289
so let me just say pan emulating what I
just did

443
00:24:41,289 --> 00:24:47,970
also ahead are

444
00:24:47,970 --> 00:24:51,260
so it is a normal sequences net normal
keys

445
00:24:51,260 --> 00:24:54,408
see just said I want to put in a normal
key and then type in

446
00:24:54,409 --> 00:24:58,600
are and gives you that New Line and then
XO 10

447
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:01,929
way way one sec

448
00:25:01,929 --> 00:25:07,500
like a note pad way

449
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:10,750
two seconds

450
00:25:10,750 --> 00:25:13,580
side

451
00:25:13,580 --> 00:25:20,580
all

452
00:25:21,140 --> 00:25:28,140
and then I wanna the outpatient all

453
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:32,350
okay

454
00:25:32,350 --> 00:25:38,810
so that's the basically the entire
script I just did real quick yeah I'll

455
00:25:38,810 --> 00:25:39,570
yet you're right

456
00:25:39,570 --> 00:25:43,450
thank you after no pattern in nr2 to run
the command backup

457
00:25:43,450 --> 00:25:50,450
and you can type in you want

458
00:25:50,950 --> 00:25:54,410
it's just like a plan text box so you
can you know it it generates the stuff

459
00:25:54,410 --> 00:25:56,100
oh yeah

460
00:25:56,100 --> 00:26:03,100
time not ok and I was a good then I copy
and pasted it so this is like a

461
00:26:03,470 --> 00:26:06,500
crazy flash job front and

462
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:10,950
I'd I'd stop leaving those things like
late just like why not make it like this

463
00:26:10,950 --> 00:26:14,420
why does it have to have Flash running
and slow down my browser and take for

464
00:26:14,420 --> 00:26:15,720
ever and crash other time

465
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:18,870
I the simple javascript in the text box
works really well

466
00:26:18,870 --> 00:26:23,220
so it's just plain text box in the end
you know you highlight it copied over

467
00:26:23,220 --> 00:26:26,020
and you've got your script so that makes
it a lot easier

468
00:26:26,020 --> 00:26:30,050
I am to generate a you can still you
know actually I screwed up if you type

469
00:26:30,050 --> 00:26:30,470
in

470
00:26:30,470 --> 00:26:33,940
like that's gonna

471
00:26:33,940 --> 00:26:38,290
the mess it up and I'm air handling is
difficult again I said that there's very

472
00:26:38,290 --> 00:26:39,290
limited memory

473
00:26:39,290 --> 00:26:43,490
so a lot times it'll just that'll
that'll break it I have some am

474
00:26:43,490 --> 00:26:46,690
air handling involved and maybe more

475
00:26:46,690 --> 00:26:50,860
if it gets required but its you just
cannot kinda cringed handling airs not

476
00:26:50,860 --> 00:26:51,320
because

477
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:54,950
I can I don't know how to do it it's
because it takes that additional

478
00:26:54,950 --> 00:26:58,720
about a memory that when it's running
will crash the device

479
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:05,720
cell you know this is a good safe method
to generate the scripts

480
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:12,450
I have talked about this just a minute
ago you know how to interact with that

481
00:27:12,450 --> 00:27:15,170
the %ah host operating system without
using a mouse

482
00:27:15,170 --> 00:27:20,010
there are crazy number have keys I'm
still learning them and I i get amazed

483
00:27:20,010 --> 00:27:20,860
at how many these

484
00:27:20,860 --> 00:27:24,160
you know a lot of its like weird stuff
isn't like of alt tab

485
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:27,630
some more used to but it can be like
control function 3

486
00:27:27,630 --> 00:27:31,370
and do something really calling crazy
this is all kinds of commands that

487
00:27:31,370 --> 00:27:32,860
that's not a real highlight that does

488
00:27:32,860 --> 00:27:36,590
but there are lots of these modify key
combinations out there

489
00:27:36,590 --> 00:27:39,510
and they're different for different
operating systems which is why I

490
00:27:39,510 --> 00:27:41,370
mentioned before I i targeted you know

491
00:27:41,370 --> 00:27:45,690
OS X Windows and Linux because they each
have different ways to run stuff

492
00:27:45,690 --> 00:27:50,000
so I had to write them separately but I
yeah if you look online Microsoft

493
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,340
actually has a really good

494
00:27:51,340 --> 00:27:56,300
if you can find down has good I'm
documentation and chunks about

495
00:27:56,300 --> 00:28:00,170
certain types of keyboard combinations
to do this app settings

496
00:28:00,170 --> 00:28:03,280
so there's a lot out there they said you
can pretty much everything without the

497
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:03,770
loss

498
00:28:03,770 --> 00:28:07,220
just ahead attacks I

499
00:28:07,220 --> 00:28:10,820
leveraging head to do attack for the
pros and cons in general

500
00:28:10,820 --> 00:28:14,580
so it's as far as I know it's not
detected by

501
00:28:14,580 --> 00:28:17,620
antivirus I don't know if any because
again you not leveraging you not

502
00:28:17,620 --> 00:28:21,530
add anything to the system not modifying
the system

503
00:28:21,530 --> 00:28:24,990
in any way before you know running the
scripts are running back

504
00:28:24,990 --> 00:28:28,980
the system is designed to run batch so
you're modifying the system we're doing

505
00:28:28,980 --> 00:28:30,060
a back door whatever

506
00:28:30,060 --> 00:28:34,040
do that I using native resources again
not gonna attack that

507
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:37,350
and you know you just use the common
ones that super simple

508
00:28:37,350 --> 00:28:40,530
works very very quickly as we'll see
later on

509
00:28:40,530 --> 00:28:44,120
I like enacted to give me a cover that
the concierge

510
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:47,510
the plug it in or somebody it has to be
plugged in action so you have to play it

511
00:28:47,510 --> 00:28:48,810
has to be plugged N

512
00:28:48,810 --> 00:28:51,860
this is a piece of hardware to test to
get there Tom

513
00:28:51,860 --> 00:28:54,150
that could mean you doing and that can
mean somebody else saying it like you

514
00:28:54,150 --> 00:28:57,640
mean it it get somebody gets tricked
into doing it accidentally

515
00:28:57,640 --> 00:29:00,850
I am and yet that previous knowledge you

516
00:29:00,850 --> 00:29:04,210
you should have previous knowledge up
the system that might just mean

517
00:29:04,210 --> 00:29:08,510
well I assume that under my pen testing
I got at a.m.

518
00:29:08,510 --> 00:29:12,200
a corporate site and they're probably
anne's outlook

519
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:15,680
most likely they're gonna use Outlook so
might buy targeted attack is

520
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:19,740
leveraging outlook it might be used
under bird potentially

521
00:29:19,740 --> 00:29:23,010
but you know you think if we environment
needs check out the resources that are

522
00:29:23,010 --> 00:29:23,470
there

523
00:29:23,470 --> 00:29:26,790
command line is often the way to go if
you can or like

524
00:29:26,790 --> 00:29:30,710
I'd like to run this in Firefox my mind
I have Firefox ease and export then

525
00:29:30,710 --> 00:29:31,530
explores

526
00:29:31,530 --> 00:29:36,270
going to be there most likely different
versions can mess things up so it's it's

527
00:29:36,270 --> 00:29:38,370
good to know the little prep work
beforehand

528
00:29:38,370 --> 00:29:41,890
and results I said results me
unpredictable

529
00:29:41,890 --> 00:29:45,810
most the time that's in the delay so
it's better to do a longer delay

530
00:29:45,810 --> 00:29:49,050
in a shorter one is your honor system
it's great for their system happens the

531
00:29:49,050 --> 00:29:49,490
running

532
00:29:49,490 --> 00:29:54,100
three VM's or you know it's doing some
other application or so slow

533
00:29:54,100 --> 00:29:59,980
see you want to give a little bit more
buffer room there so

534
00:29:59,980 --> 00:30:03,260
I'll show you a little bit at the
library for anybody wants the program

535
00:30:03,260 --> 00:30:07,020
now talk about a bit more but this
project started out as a librarian is

536
00:30:07,020 --> 00:30:08,320
actually expanded into

537
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:12,889
not having the code I our program is
devices so

538
00:30:12,890 --> 00:30:16,150
this will be for the programs out there
when his library and then ima talk about

539
00:30:16,150 --> 00:30:17,240
for everybody else who doesn't

540
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:24,240
program we I got you covered

541
00:30:30,090 --> 00:30:35,680
some nothing at all OVA cared om just
looking at the header file

542
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:38,790
real quick so this is all you really
need to leverage and it's basically

543
00:30:38,790 --> 00:30:40,950
exactly what I've described so far

544
00:30:40,950 --> 00:30:44,390
um its yeah you've got your

545
00:30:44,390 --> 00:30:47,760
I want to run a binary and that's just
got it for the different operating

546
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:48,320
systems

547
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:52,210
so here's all the windows binary
functions this to run a script

548
00:30:52,210 --> 00:30:55,340
to run a command and around the head
script and the

549
00:30:55,340 --> 00:30:58,740
all-important red button all you're
doing is best it I at

550
00:30:58,740 --> 00:31:03,500
where to put that file on the offerings
are some and wear tear it off the SD

551
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:05,630
card and it takes care of everything
else

552
00:31:05,630 --> 00:31:09,110
makes it very simple all that's done in
the background just say hey

553
00:31:09,110 --> 00:31:12,250
is whether file is here as I watch a lot
on their

554
00:31:12,250 --> 00:31:16,230
I would suggest the temp directory and
you know you're off and running

555
00:31:16,230 --> 00:31:19,820
so that that set up the whole thing that
you need to weigh about

556
00:31:19,820 --> 00:31:23,899
launch code in the back in the mix run
and does all that start menu stuff for

557
00:31:23,900 --> 00:31:24,180
you

558
00:31:24,180 --> 00:31:31,180
but that makes it much more much easier
to use

559
00:31:34,380 --> 00:31:37,900
so I can you do talk by different
commands and stuff and this is just the

560
00:31:37,900 --> 00:31:39,440
tip of the iceberg do not like

561
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:43,070
22 seconds I think these things so
coming from a security perspective

562
00:31:43,070 --> 00:31:46,210
I you leverage stored credentials so

563
00:31:46,210 --> 00:31:50,020
sensor on their system say you want to
log into their Twitter accounts and to

564
00:31:50,020 --> 00:31:50,610
eat something

565
00:31:50,610 --> 00:31:55,029
you can as if there's credentials are
stored you just go into

566
00:31:55,029 --> 00:31:59,159
their web browser a type and order dot
com in it says are welcome sounds oh and

567
00:31:59,159 --> 00:31:59,539
you say

568
00:31:59,539 --> 00:32:02,740
cool and then you you know get tab a
couple times

569
00:32:02,740 --> 00:32:08,340
and then you treat because you know
inspection 11 if a student abacus the

570
00:32:08,340 --> 00:32:09,840
next link on the Next button

571
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:13,980
so you know what the interface looks
like see just practice is a tad wants to

572
00:32:13,980 --> 00:32:17,809
34 okay five times and that gets me and
see where I want to you

573
00:32:17,809 --> 00:32:24,809
picco yeah to do what

574
00:32:25,570 --> 00:32:32,570
he said it has keyboard mapping to do I
also when you're in their website if you

575
00:32:33,260 --> 00:32:33,990
hit an

576
00:32:33,990 --> 00:32:37,190
and you not gonna in in act like
anything open up the box

577
00:32:37,190 --> 00:32:41,340
that I'm glad I fear that as a ran an
example is the family is even

578
00:32:41,340 --> 00:32:45,649
easier to do you on twitter thanks where

579
00:32:45,649 --> 00:32:50,130
I okay I should I would've been a cold
and I did I didn't even try that but I

580
00:32:50,130 --> 00:32:53,320
that's definitely doable and that's even
simpler than hang tab through

581
00:32:53,320 --> 00:32:57,580
I am a couple times but you think about
do I have credentials stored

582
00:32:57,580 --> 00:33:01,169
what do I have credentials stored for
your bank account solemn

583
00:33:01,169 --> 00:33:04,230
corporate information you need to be
able to predict its other in like a bank

584
00:33:04,230 --> 00:33:04,710
account

585
00:33:04,710 --> 00:33:08,240
you if you had when you get to the login
process corporate

586
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:12,130
internal resources if it's something a
common internal resource you can log

587
00:33:12,130 --> 00:33:12,870
into that

588
00:33:12,870 --> 00:33:16,010
I other things you might need their
Facebook page other things you might

589
00:33:16,010 --> 00:33:17,029
think they had

590
00:33:17,029 --> 00:33:22,600
to post or still information from and
send it to yourself as a lot of things

591
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:24,240
you can do when you're on the box

592
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:28,909
download something from the web you can
type in a URL that has the binary

593
00:33:28,909 --> 00:33:33,049
the whole full path and then you go down
that it that way I had a user account

594
00:33:33,049 --> 00:33:36,070
I set up a back door I

595
00:33:36,070 --> 00:33:39,149
you can set up a factor in a timely and
almost all and all these

596
00:33:39,149 --> 00:33:42,200
you don't need to download anything
really to set up these back doors and

597
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:43,360
buy back to i mean

598
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:46,940
it's going to connect out see or allow
you to connect and and the user

599
00:33:46,940 --> 00:33:51,340
it was a previously running service or
it's not supposed act like that I you

600
00:33:51,340 --> 00:33:52,570
can reconfigure the game

601
00:33:52,570 --> 00:33:55,850
the system settings it's way easier to
do with the command line

602
00:33:55,850 --> 00:33:59,710
I think point-and-click confuses me and
when there's a specially

603
00:33:59,710 --> 00:34:03,120
it's nice to be able to go into a
commanding be able to change things

604
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:07,000
and you can must year old don't know
that much you'll never use the command

605
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,399
prompt in Windows in their life

606
00:34:08,399 --> 00:34:13,219
is a lot easier to type in you typing in
like 10 characters and you can add a

607
00:34:13,220 --> 00:34:13,710
user

608
00:34:13,710 --> 00:34:17,849
verses looking around try to remember I
want to go back to the class 6a

609
00:34:17,849 --> 00:34:21,669
thanks I don't know how many things that
the click-through the get to add user

610
00:34:21,668 --> 00:34:24,848
and then you have to go through all
these different steps yes yes that is a

611
00:34:24,849 --> 00:34:26,990
fine picture I like that one at a
Newtown

612
00:34:26,990 --> 00:34:30,280
so

613
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:34,820
I yeah and then of course there's the
classic I am that's our dat ass star

614
00:34:34,820 --> 00:34:39,260
so what does that do by

615
00:34:39,260 --> 00:34:43,450
I didn't do route but he now where it's
running from

616
00:34:43,449 --> 00:34:47,439
so the harbour platform i'm talking
about. I'm calling

617
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:50,800
the glitch and I this is my prior typing

618
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:55,089
a bit are so it's tiny and thats that
specifically designed to beast that

619
00:34:55,089 --> 00:34:55,659
small

620
00:34:55,659 --> 00:35:00,380
I and this is performing all the stuff
you can see in the this is that the

621
00:35:00,380 --> 00:35:03,930
3d-printed case that I have four others
the little USB port

622
00:35:03,930 --> 00:35:07,990
a micro SD slot it's got the debts which
is arm actually I guess this is getting

623
00:35:07,990 --> 00:35:11,200
excited describe at is is exacting talk
about

624
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:14,530
so it the prototype is based on the
teensy plus plus

625
00:35:14,530 --> 00:35:17,839
which is an Arduino compatible board com

626
00:35:17,839 --> 00:35:22,250
using Atmel processors again looking at
are doing a compatible projects here

627
00:35:22,250 --> 00:35:26,660
micro SD DIP switch solderless bands

628
00:35:26,660 --> 00:35:30,098
so you don't have to solder they the
goal this is not to you

629
00:35:30,099 --> 00:35:33,410
well I'll talk about that some other
goals later on but you you wanna

630
00:35:33,410 --> 00:35:33,879
villages

631
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:38,130
plug an additional modules later and as
the USB interface obviously even

632
00:35:38,130 --> 00:35:39,310
emulating keyword

633
00:35:39,310 --> 00:35:43,190
it's good to out somehow be a normal
looking keyboard so this

634
00:35:43,190 --> 00:35:49,130
particular devices goes in for USB %uh
so configuration

635
00:35:49,130 --> 00:35:52,500
I mention for like that they're
suffering capsulatum modules

636
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:57,500
I am at the SD card so that these files
in just plain text files are probably

637
00:35:57,500 --> 00:36:00,490
come up with some sorta interface to
generate like the headline

638
00:36:00,490 --> 00:36:03,569
but this is just like you know you have
gone over to the notepad and type it out

639
00:36:03,569 --> 00:36:05,099
for all these things

640
00:36:05,099 --> 00:36:09,060
right now will be i'd is the airport and
click interface later on for people

641
00:36:09,060 --> 00:36:13,060
on basic modules you you basically have
you have a configuration file

642
00:36:13,060 --> 00:36:16,099
that a reason first and it tells it all
I wanna run this

643
00:36:16,099 --> 00:36:20,030
this paler that I have is for Windows
and it's a python file

644
00:36:20,030 --> 00:36:24,010
okay that's a python are run it actor
they are right as a Python script or

645
00:36:24,010 --> 00:36:27,339
hey this is their heady scripts you can
run it in this way

646
00:36:27,339 --> 00:36:31,020
so that's what the configuration file is
it's very tiny it's a couple its

647
00:36:31,020 --> 00:36:34,069
couple lines seat on the operating
system you have a couple of things you

648
00:36:34,069 --> 00:36:36,240
can say to a delay

649
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:40,089
which is I'll talk about now the delay
is important because the drivers install

650
00:36:40,089 --> 00:36:41,410
and like Windows

651
00:36:41,410 --> 00:36:44,580
this work natively most other things but
generally when when this is anything new

652
00:36:44,580 --> 00:36:48,339
tries to install drivers see get that
pop up for a couple seconds so I like to

653
00:36:48,339 --> 00:36:49,660
set delay

654
00:36:49,660 --> 00:36:52,799
anytime I'm gonna be a targeting a new
system

655
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:56,650
just for the drivers to set up and then
from there on

656
00:36:56,650 --> 00:37:00,250
the drivers in my age should work right
away but it might get funky with

657
00:37:00,250 --> 00:37:03,780
how they set it up in whatever cell I
have a there's a delay in their

658
00:37:03,780 --> 00:37:08,390
some other options you can do to you
tell more about the configuration

659
00:37:08,390 --> 00:37:12,859
but it is it's very very simple very
short and a lot of its optional

660
00:37:12,859 --> 00:37:17,430
%uh so again you can select model on the
plot fly right now I have 32

661
00:37:17,430 --> 00:37:21,169
you can select up to 32 different
options arm

662
00:37:21,170 --> 00:37:24,380
which I think there's a lot and that's
why I wrote the help it

663
00:37:24,380 --> 00:37:27,640
option in there cuz remember in 30
different payloads difficult

664
00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:30,660
most likely you won't need that many for
whatever you're doing you might need a

665
00:37:30,660 --> 00:37:31,399
couple

666
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:34,720
but you know that's what's on it right
now there's a lot of from their

667
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:37,940
to select from

668
00:37:37,940 --> 00:37:44,300
alright so de ma number one

669
00:37:44,300 --> 00:37:47,589
and I'm gonna be demonstrating so that
that there's that

670
00:37:47,589 --> 00:37:51,040
the prototype %uh what it's going to
look like and the prototype what I have

671
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:51,960
right now

672
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:55,810
I am for for just running these demos

673
00:37:55,810 --> 00:37:58,970
so I got a couple dinners and I'm gonna
run to you you're gonna see how

674
00:37:58,970 --> 00:38:05,970
how this works an actively

675
00:38:08,170 --> 00:38:12,100
so the first time and you I is it on a
as a mayor used it on a

676
00:38:12,100 --> 00:38:15,640
yeah eric is on a calm and you can see

677
00:38:15,640 --> 00:38:18,940
the difference between this one and the
other is

678
00:38:18,940 --> 00:38:23,880
there's a little 3.0 out there I had
this is the new version that will be

679
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:24,560
coming out

680
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:28,170
soon my goal is to do out beta release

681
00:38:28,170 --> 00:38:32,610
at Def Con my goal nobody hold me to
that but that's what I helped am very

682
00:38:32,610 --> 00:38:33,870
very close to having it done

683
00:38:33,870 --> 00:38:36,930
so that's a sidebar another project I'm
working on

684
00:38:36,930 --> 00:38:40,740
this is a multiboot USB drive

685
00:38:40,740 --> 00:38:44,420
so it's all running out by possible you
can select from all stuff so

686
00:38:44,420 --> 00:38:49,330
I trying to try to use this

687
00:38:49,330 --> 00:38:54,690
the II decide actually I

688
00:38:54,690 --> 00:38:58,210
but these pens going out there going out
Fandango and

689
00:38:58,210 --> 00:39:01,570
I am just to make it look a little bit
better and actually fit and if you

690
00:39:01,570 --> 00:39:02,640
really well and you can still

691
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:05,670
but stuff into it but at Skyway it looks
like

692
00:39:05,670 --> 00:39:08,970
this is this again this is just my demo
it's going to be

693
00:39:08,970 --> 00:39:15,970
much smaller than this

694
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:27,130
okay so I have a delay sat down in the
system right now

695
00:39:27,130 --> 00:39:30,400
and actually I I had two days I had one
built an

696
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:34,450
to the software and then I have the one
that was I can pick up on the config

697
00:39:34,450 --> 00:39:34,940
file

698
00:39:34,940 --> 00:39:39,170
and I have them both running so I am at
see if it the

699
00:39:39,170 --> 00:39:42,900
starts up it should take it takes a
couple seconds unfortunately

700
00:39:42,900 --> 00:39:46,510
I said every program that before but I

701
00:39:46,510 --> 00:39:53,140
its ok

702
00:39:53,140 --> 00:39:59,000
okay I'm gonna try playing from the
other side packet what's ahead 7-0

703
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:02,640
what is zero do nothin

704
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:06,430
best demo our success

705
00:40:06,430 --> 00:40:11,879
success that was the first demo could
did not been

706
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:18,880
see you guys later okay

707
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:32,150
so VGA cable wish I had a question i has

708
00:40:32,150 --> 00:40:37,270
a cord that's like a extension USB
extension cable

709
00:40:37,270 --> 00:40:41,099
over yet because I'll I'm very nervous
about this plugging in here

710
00:40:41,099 --> 00:40:45,920
I had one earlier but okay so now it's
all

711
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:49,640
check little bit better

712
00:40:49,640 --> 00:40:53,410
%uh to often running so I just started
up I i'm not

713
00:40:53,410 --> 00:40:56,569
thanks we

714
00:40:56,570 --> 00:41:00,050
so I okay leveraging this one so

715
00:41:00,050 --> 00:41:03,980
the idea for this attack is gonna wait
for backtrack to do it's a tax law

716
00:41:03,980 --> 00:41:07,260
I your on-site you want to set up a
backdoor

717
00:41:07,260 --> 00:41:11,170
you walk into an unoccupied office at
the other computer sitting there but it

718
00:41:11,170 --> 00:41:12,480
looks like the nothing's going on

719
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:16,119
you plug and Yucatan a flash I you plug
n

720
00:41:16,119 --> 00:41:22,070
your glitch you power of machines of you
but the you push the power button

721
00:41:22,070 --> 00:41:27,290
and she trapped miner any walk away and
then everything else happens

722
00:41:27,290 --> 00:41:32,130
like this so that's year 15-20 seconds
inside the RAM

723
00:41:32,130 --> 00:41:35,579
and then you walked away so it's going
to you boots into

724
00:41:35,579 --> 00:41:40,560
I'm using backtrack here I socit I it's
bringing in the back track you can do

725
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:42,819
this just for the backside live CD a
backcheck

726
00:41:42,819 --> 00:41:47,210
flash drive for this particular demo all

727
00:41:47,210 --> 00:41:52,250
now gonna be hard the problem is that
it's not full screen I don't wanna

728
00:41:52,250 --> 00:41:57,130
now starting over

729
00:41:57,130 --> 00:42:01,319
its

730
00:42:01,319 --> 00:42:08,319
as low as I can

731
00:42:29,790 --> 00:42:33,070
Asustek a Santa Teresa some actually
booting and

732
00:42:33,070 --> 00:42:36,570
March a box of my flash drive which is
super cool

733
00:42:36,570 --> 00:42:43,570
I was psyched when I found I could do
that

734
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:06,349
okay now in a full screen there should
be a problem is like a big men usually

735
00:43:06,349 --> 00:43:08,240
smaller than a guest post Rena had a

736
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:11,839
change resolution and blah blah blah so
if this starts we should be good

737
00:43:11,839 --> 00:43:13,460
position to be able to see the whole
screen

738
00:43:13,460 --> 00:43:16,540
well I there is I pulled it out as
Iranian type then

739
00:43:16,540 --> 00:43:21,069
was going to be below the viewing area I
guess I got

740
00:43:21,069 --> 00:43:25,359
halfpipe there are saying I am a in the
Dropbox you've got its gonna it's gonna

741
00:43:25,359 --> 00:43:30,799
SSH back to you I am okay

742
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:34,900
who seen enough blank screen so far
today

743
00:43:34,900 --> 00:43:39,760
I when I was gonna be my fellow I bids
and now I have to you

744
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:43,540
wait for it actually fits putting so
there are no good way to

745
00:43:43,540 --> 00:43:47,040
make it big any further so but when it
does do we're gonna see some

746
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:51,930
some awesomeness so I'm but you know you
could do all kinds of stuff here

747
00:43:51,930 --> 00:43:55,270
I'm just this particular demo was just
trying to leverage I

748
00:43:55,270 --> 00:44:00,170
adding suggest getting into the the box
really quickly and you know

749
00:44:00,170 --> 00:44:05,040
add cream this this backdoor so

750
00:44:05,040 --> 00:44:08,710
song-and-dance a good time

751
00:44:08,710 --> 00:44:13,150
questions thank you so

752
00:44:13,150 --> 00:44:17,920
the documentation says they can type 5
100 keys a second for this library

753
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:21,960
I am but that operating systems you to
handle especially when you're going

754
00:44:21,960 --> 00:44:23,190
through a virtual machine

755
00:44:23,190 --> 00:44:27,710
I'll a lot it's been a lot I'm figuring
out that I had to lay a lot more in the

756
00:44:27,710 --> 00:44:29,740
virtual machines cuz I'm passin stuff

757
00:44:29,740 --> 00:44:33,210
so you I it's hard to say and you
generally

758
00:44:33,210 --> 00:44:40,210
it offers up 10 minutes

759
00:44:44,670 --> 00:44:48,700
i guess i okay of so soon I a password
I'll get to you there

760
00:44:48,700 --> 00:44:53,740
apologize generate an SSH key citing the
service

761
00:44:53,740 --> 00:44:58,100
a there's delays involved it's hard to
protect

762
00:44:58,100 --> 00:45:01,170
now it's creating a back door to my
computer

763
00:45:01,170 --> 00:45:04,690
it says yes I would like to accept that
are as a Rs a key

764
00:45:04,690 --> 00:45:07,920
and now its asking for a password what's
the password

765
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:10,990
you know I password yeah i connect my
box

766
00:45:10,990 --> 00:45:17,990
said let's see if I can connect and you

767
00:45:43,570 --> 00:45:50,570
yeeee I gotta your network

768
00:45:50,630 --> 00:45:54,160
I'm connected back to me through SSH

769
00:45:54,160 --> 00:45:57,790
so this is not known only thing you're
going and this is reverse back it

770
00:45:57,790 --> 00:45:59,190
connected to my computer

771
00:45:59,190 --> 00:46:03,250
from inside the masses network and now
I'm able to connect the modem my local

772
00:46:03,250 --> 00:46:05,830
ports to their a box and control
completely

773
00:46:05,830 --> 00:46:09,680
so I am sad that I have 10 that's good
that a lot of other

774
00:46:09,680 --> 00:46:16,680
record demos I to do class the yeah

775
00:46:18,710 --> 00:46:25,580
yeah

776
00:46:25,580 --> 00:46:30,880
amended already thats I skipped the a

777
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:35,990
sees darn

778
00:46:35,990 --> 00:46:40,130
darned yeah

779
00:46:40,130 --> 00:46:47,130
other cover that at the end saw talk by
saying how to

780
00:46:53,240 --> 00:47:00,240
the FBI on it

781
00:47:25,910 --> 00:47:29,080
here we have a pretty files

782
00:47:29,080 --> 00:47:33,319
now right away so this one i'm a skip I
think about my slide this one was called

783
00:47:33,320 --> 00:47:33,690
on

784
00:47:33,690 --> 00:47:37,460
where's my money and the idea is that
all your roommate

785
00:47:37,460 --> 00:47:40,780
or a a cohabitant knows you for the rent

786
00:47:40,780 --> 00:47:43,960
and you want to punish them and you want
your rent money

787
00:47:43,960 --> 00:47:50,960
cell I

788
00:48:18,130 --> 00:48:18,630
close

789
00:48:18,630 --> 00:48:25,630
to have them

790
00:48:31,030 --> 00:48:32,250
I'm the fail here

791
00:48:32,250 --> 00:48:35,270
I'm the fail that works right I'm

792
00:48:35,270 --> 00:48:41,600
I failed a feather psalmist be it
through the rest my slides on after this

793
00:48:41,600 --> 00:48:45,060
yet why at a lot more to show I am

794
00:48:45,060 --> 00:48:48,570
so I'm gonna be at the high pressure
charity both must the weekend and

795
00:48:48,570 --> 00:48:53,090
would love to talk to people about this
come on okay

796
00:48:53,090 --> 00:48:56,800
get so %um if they owe you money when
you wanna do against them we went down

797
00:48:56,800 --> 00:48:57,070
the

798
00:48:57,070 --> 00:49:01,850
this batch script what does it do runs
very quickly

799
00:49:01,850 --> 00:49:06,180
you not gonna see the co Bama tell you
what it does

800
00:49:06,180 --> 00:49:10,830
so now it's gonna go to the download
directly the download the file in

801
00:49:10,830 --> 00:49:14,930
it's going to run it Iran's a very
quickly

802
00:49:14,930 --> 00:49:18,450
where the Spalding oh you didn't 0 click

803
00:49:18,450 --> 00:49:22,760
let me tell you what they did all my
files are gone

804
00:49:22,760 --> 00:49:27,310
where did they go their hidden and I
rock 13 the name

805
00:49:27,310 --> 00:49:33,070
the so so the script it's a batch script
that I wrote

806
00:49:33,070 --> 00:49:37,200
and Iraq 13 that hides the name so I
like you doing everything now I'm not

807
00:49:37,200 --> 00:49:44,200
quiet

808
00:49:45,750 --> 00:49:50,380
what the what is that well I have the
top 13 extension are up thirteen the

809
00:49:50,380 --> 00:49:50,890
name

810
00:49:50,890 --> 00:49:54,310
and the extension so if you don't know
what you're doing

811
00:49:54,310 --> 00:49:58,759
when there's never gonna let you run
this house again I have a reverse

812
00:49:58,760 --> 00:50:05,760
and I can do but that's obviously when
they paid the rent

813
00:50:07,319 --> 00:50:09,339
okay so this is a very tough I'm gonna
get through this

814
00:50:09,339 --> 00:50:13,069
up I finish this then I was on my power
went out the night before so I did most

815
00:50:13,069 --> 00:50:14,400
is Emma's by candlelight

816
00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:18,690
so I cover that i'm gonna skip it I
apologize this the

817
00:50:18,690 --> 00:50:22,440
that the library is up online right now
I

818
00:50:22,440 --> 00:50:25,970
my project page where you'll see at the
end i've a lot of lives I'm going up

819
00:50:25,970 --> 00:50:26,260
there

820
00:50:26,260 --> 00:50:30,299
so let's play hide the glitch %uh
computer mouse

821
00:50:30,299 --> 00:50:35,470
that's right my friend the computer
mouse X's should say

822
00:50:35,470 --> 00:50:39,619
my fully functional at still fully
functional computer mouse

823
00:50:39,619 --> 00:50:43,099
questions are gonna be held to the ANX I
had like 35 seconds

824
00:50:43,099 --> 00:50:47,760
building at this is a USB hub took some
parts apart

825
00:50:47,760 --> 00:50:50,980
cited together figure part there again
and

826
00:50:50,980 --> 00:50:55,049
so I'm going through this quickly so
this is the end result

827
00:50:55,049 --> 00:50:59,190
and applied in flat micro-usb port stick
it in there

828
00:50:59,190 --> 00:51:03,280
close the lid to working device and
await how will I want to inject the keys

829
00:51:03,280 --> 00:51:07,349
so I think about everything in my house
they took up to a computer

830
00:51:07,349 --> 00:51:11,180
it's an epidemic a boy to face the USB
Drive

831
00:51:11,180 --> 00:51:14,650
fits in your desktop the others up
imports inside program

832
00:51:14,650 --> 00:51:18,339
this is a

833
00:51:18,339 --> 00:51:20,750
obviously the hard drive is gone

834
00:51:20,750 --> 00:51:26,830
the so so the hard drive eyesight is
gone but I was like what can I use an

835
00:51:26,830 --> 00:51:29,970
enclosure that's just around because I
took that out and that's the hard drive

836
00:51:29,970 --> 00:51:30,690
my laptop

837
00:51:30,690 --> 00:51:34,090
because it was cheaper to buy an
external hard drive been an internal one

838
00:51:34,090 --> 00:51:37,930
and they're the exact same thing with
little adapter I can't see much I have

839
00:51:37,930 --> 00:51:38,600
to work quickly

840
00:51:38,600 --> 00:51:42,400
then I got bored I decided well one out
that a little bit so Adam eichard

841
00:51:42,400 --> 00:51:46,660
SD card reader in it as well so every
that get on attack I showed you

842
00:51:46,660 --> 00:51:51,310
that will run from this mouse so

843
00:51:51,310 --> 00:51:55,410
okay what's on the paleo I don't think
that i'm gonna add is it'll run once

844
00:51:55,410 --> 00:51:58,290
so it'll run that one time and every
time that such a crime that it's

845
00:51:58,290 --> 00:51:59,050
rebooted

846
00:51:59,050 --> 00:52:02,890
it will not run see you have that one
shot and the not gonna see it in acting

847
00:52:02,890 --> 00:52:03,819
weird everytime

848
00:52:03,820 --> 00:52:08,470
a when you're trying to you pac-10 goals
in the project at the CLECs

849
00:52:08,470 --> 00:52:11,780
so this is only one component of this
project that I'm working on it was kinda

850
00:52:11,780 --> 00:52:12,500
baseline

851
00:52:12,500 --> 00:52:15,710
but I the goals at the glitz hardware
project

852
00:52:15,710 --> 00:52:19,750
is to provide a hardware security
testing so not just the highway but

853
00:52:19,750 --> 00:52:22,970
leveraging is open hardware projects for
the masses

854
00:52:22,970 --> 00:52:27,320
so you don't have to solder yourself you
can just are you up you know you'll get

855
00:52:27,320 --> 00:52:27,630
it

856
00:52:27,630 --> 00:52:31,180
and to be able to configure a very
quickly and easily no coding

857
00:52:31,180 --> 00:52:34,620
are you know scripting maybe a little
bit configuration but no coding

858
00:52:34,620 --> 00:52:38,810
I no hardware use again the app fighting
everything and two minutes

859
00:52:38,810 --> 00:52:41,900
some projects I'm working on I got a
keylogger working

860
00:52:41,900 --> 00:52:46,460
so the keylogger will work or keys in
the same manner that the script works

861
00:52:46,460 --> 00:52:49,920
seeking record them and then replay them
exactly the same way

862
00:52:49,920 --> 00:52:53,970
so this is this is working pretty well
um I'm gonna

863
00:52:53,970 --> 00:52:58,300
do more with wireless I have a RFID is
my next thing that I want to add to it

864
00:52:58,300 --> 00:53:01,650
so that I can test the security
leveraging this device are fighting

865
00:53:01,650 --> 00:53:03,580
aliens and Bluetooth and maybe wifi

866
00:53:03,580 --> 00:53:06,630
I do you like audio/video recording it
depends on where

867
00:53:06,630 --> 00:53:09,760
the other projects that I find to add on
to hear but more with a

868
00:53:09,760 --> 00:53:13,420
its a more of a security standpoint I

869
00:53:13,420 --> 00:53:17,290
the hope workshop yes can we can I get 1
I'm going to be doing a workshop

870
00:53:17,290 --> 00:53:18,340
tomorrow

871
00:53:18,340 --> 00:53:22,490
on the six floor at one o'clock I it's
going to be a hundred dollars but the

872
00:53:22,490 --> 00:53:23,570
proceeds going to benefit

873
00:53:23,570 --> 00:53:27,600
benefit hackers for charity others 25
July 25 slots

874
00:53:27,600 --> 00:53:31,320
so I'll be a tax attorney booth tomorrow
morning and throughout the day

875
00:53:31,320 --> 00:53:34,640
if you wanna buy the kids to me before
you know they sell out I'm will do the

876
00:53:34,640 --> 00:53:35,680
workshop will build it

877
00:53:35,680 --> 00:53:39,100
as I went really quickly here we'll have
more time we can talk about how these

878
00:53:39,100 --> 00:53:40,300
injections work

879
00:53:40,300 --> 00:53:44,980
I am and I'm trying to make the
collection a hardware reality is a right

880
00:53:44,980 --> 00:53:47,150
now I have to solder a lot of stuff
together

881
00:53:47,150 --> 00:53:50,750
are trying to actually build one so I'm
going to be using Kickstarter

882
00:53:50,750 --> 00:53:54,080
I which is an awesome website for kind
of starting your own projects

883
00:53:54,080 --> 00:53:58,720
um their various levels others I the
lowest levels I made the glitches a

884
00:53:58,720 --> 00:53:59,420
sticker

885
00:53:59,420 --> 00:54:03,080
it's gonna cost like 10 bucks and then
you had levels up we're gonna buy 10 you

886
00:54:03,080 --> 00:54:04,330
can buy with the keylogger

887
00:54:04,330 --> 00:54:08,160
or II couple people are going to be able
to buy one with modified keyboards a

888
00:54:08,160 --> 00:54:09,279
modified nice

889
00:54:09,280 --> 00:54:12,850
got to glitches and a lager and it's
like the complete bundle

890
00:54:12,850 --> 00:54:16,490
version of it but I'm hand making the
keyboard mouse is only a couple others

891
00:54:16,490 --> 00:54:17,130
available

892
00:54:17,130 --> 00:54:20,590
the first 25 people that sign up will
get the case

893
00:54:20,590 --> 00:54:24,680
the Kickstarter page is not up it'll be
up early next week

894
00:54:24,680 --> 00:54:27,960
I got the approval stuff I i'm waiting
out yeah

895
00:54:27,960 --> 00:54:31,400
so there's there's a lot of steps up to
