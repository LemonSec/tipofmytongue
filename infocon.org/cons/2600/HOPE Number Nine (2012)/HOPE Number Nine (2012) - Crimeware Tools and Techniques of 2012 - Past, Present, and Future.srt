1
00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:03,480
for two years ago at the at the last
hope conference arm

2
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:08,170
we we basically went over that deserves
inspired Trojans as well as a

3
00:00:08,170 --> 00:00:11,800
a few exploit kits and I'll that back
then no

4
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:15,670
that the things we're exhibit different
a lot has changed in 24 months

5
00:00:15,670 --> 00:00:19,640
a bit about me for for those who are

6
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:23,230
mister first time I am i worked in a
information security

7
00:00:23,230 --> 00:00:26,849
arm I've worked with her defense
contractors and and banks

8
00:00:26,849 --> 00:00:30,560
doing portability alice is a penetration
testing I'm currently working with the

9
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:32,340
PLX sir team at Calexico

10
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:36,160
doing forensic so a intelligent analysis
and

11
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:39,910
a threat research on dedust tools and
techniques and I'm

12
00:00:39,910 --> 00:00:43,530
also president of the heck mami
hackerspace at a South Florida and on

13
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:45,030
the border the South Florida lost

14
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:48,980
and a standard disclaimer

15
00:00:48,980 --> 00:00:52,190
all the information contained in this
presentation is for informational

16
00:00:52,190 --> 00:00:53,160
purposes only

17
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:56,850
but don't actually attacked servers were
going to discuss your abilities

18
00:00:56,850 --> 00:01:01,010
arm don't actually a engage life system
so we've

19
00:01:01,010 --> 00:01:04,759
though it downstairs in the mezzanine
level we have a capture the flag that's

20
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:06,030
running that incorporates

21
00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:09,659
all the tools so we're going to be
discussing in this so if you wanna if

22
00:01:09,659 --> 00:01:12,130
you're looking to exploit some crime
kits we have a very safe flight

23
00:01:12,130 --> 00:01:14,149
environment downstairs to be able to do
that with

24
00:01:14,150 --> 00:01:16,860
and you'll be able to try out that the
exploits that we're going there will be

25
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:17,509
going over

26
00:01:17,509 --> 00:01:21,680
and you even if you do really want to
try and find

27
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:25,580
no bulletproof servers are hosting this
type of stuff don't do it if you're an

28
00:01:25,580 --> 00:01:26,270
american

29
00:01:26,270 --> 00:01:29,679
the FBI likes to hunt Americans and are

30
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:33,509
all information that's contained in this
was obtained legally

31
00:01:33,509 --> 00:01:37,220
through third parties in according to
the laws of the land which the rich side

32
00:01:37,220 --> 00:01:40,259
so

33
00:01:40,259 --> 00:01:43,689
last time we spoke Zeus 2.0 is still a
private kit

34
00:01:43,689 --> 00:01:46,880
that older versions is were circling
publicly but the

35
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:49,908
2.0 is still private us by I

36
00:01:49,909 --> 00:01:53,360
was fairly new and hadn't yet been
publicly linked arm

37
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:56,680
automated credit card shops those were
those were

38
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:59,680
a a rare phenomenon there they had
started to

39
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:03,430
there started to emerge but they they
weren't they weren't as prevalent as

40
00:02:03,430 --> 00:02:04,229
they are today

41
00:02:04,229 --> 00:02:07,539
almost to the crime where kits arm

42
00:02:07,540 --> 00:02:10,750
vulnerabilities that existed we're still
private they were just so

43
00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:14,020
circulated among the underground within
the intelligence community's but they

44
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:15,099
weren't they weren't good

45
00:02:15,099 --> 00:02:18,799
disclosed in public knowledge a like
they are today this

46
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:22,110
the blackhole exploit kit was in its
infancy today it's

47
00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:25,760
me though the won the primary exploit
kit center and use

48
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:28,870
arm things like big point didn't exist

49
00:02:28,870 --> 00:02:32,440
peer to peer trip to curtsy as a concept
as a merged

50
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:35,920
within the with the last year's end
Adobe products

51
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:39,260
in 2010 where the most horrible vector
that is

52
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:44,049
that is also now change and here you
know just a

53
00:02:44,050 --> 00:02:48,300
bit of nostalgia years with the black
hole beta kit back in 2010 before it

54
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:50,269
publicly on the market before was

55
00:02:50,269 --> 00:02:53,620
the the comprehensive product is say
with licensing and

56
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:57,849
a automatic updates and all that stuff
house we're back when Phoenix and

57
00:02:57,849 --> 00:03:01,129
Praga said yes we're still still remain
exploit kits that were

58
00:03:01,129 --> 00:03:04,989
circulating the underground and

59
00:03:04,989 --> 00:03:09,239
sense this time Java is now the new
attack vector

60
00:03:09,239 --> 00:03:12,760
choice Oracle seems to be slow to
Tupac's their

61
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:15,909
their updates automated fraud shops are

62
00:03:15,909 --> 00:03:19,859
now so common that just googling CVV
shop a leading

63
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:23,069
doesn't have resulted in dozens of news
articles about a recent FBI

64
00:03:23,069 --> 00:03:26,489
arrests and raids and domain seizures
related to

65
00:03:26,489 --> 00:03:30,650
to that market the major crime markets
such as is and pipes by

66
00:03:30,650 --> 00:03:34,450
now right now public arm the down to the
source code level we can even examine

67
00:03:34,450 --> 00:03:35,780
the co 2 the builders

68
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:39,739
that are making the executables and more
abilities and cry markets have been made

69
00:03:39,739 --> 00:03:40,200
public

70
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:44,220
remote file inclusion file blows and
juice as SQL injections a spy and

71
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:45,220
Eleanor

72
00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:48,890
as well as others I'll

73
00:03:48,890 --> 00:03:52,420
also de dos attacks have become more
prevalent the

74
00:03:52,420 --> 00:03:56,299
rising act as a activism over the last
two years with the with the whole

75
00:03:56,299 --> 00:03:59,489
all the different anonymous campaigns
that that their

76
00:03:59,489 --> 00:04:02,980
really significantly arm increase the
focus

77
00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:07,129
love me attention on dedust attacks and
the overall awareness adidas attacks

78
00:04:07,129 --> 00:04:11,409
and the a more tools are now available
to conduct

79
00:04:11,409 --> 00:04:15,290
up these types of attacks there are
simpler than ever up specifically Buddha

80
00:04:15,290 --> 00:04:15,849
scripts

81
00:04:15,849 --> 00:04:19,720
%uh the bar has been lowered when it
comes to the

82
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:23,380
technological requirements to the
understanding

83
00:04:23,380 --> 00:04:26,889
to be able to launches attacks conserve

84
00:04:26,889 --> 00:04:31,460
Optim botnets also emerged arm where
instead of creating set up spreading

85
00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:35,349
harm our among different machines you
just convince users to run

86
00:04:35,350 --> 00:04:39,790
to run a tool and %uh participate in a
in a target so you basically

87
00:04:39,790 --> 00:04:43,080
it you it's becoming part about it
because you're choosing to accept party

88
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:43,380
the

89
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:47,440
part the activist techniques for digital
activism

90
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:50,770
a new crime work it's the were released

91
00:04:50,770 --> 00:04:53,919
do it specifically dirt jumper which is
a

92
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:57,299
Russian de dos toolkit actually a very
potent on

93
00:04:57,300 --> 00:05:01,460
itself for its will be going into in
detail later and also zemra was a

94
00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:02,430
another

95
00:05:02,430 --> 00:05:06,259
Trojan which has recently been released
into the news and

96
00:05:06,259 --> 00:05:09,410
out leaked and also discussed in the
news and will be going into that into

97
00:05:09,410 --> 00:05:10,729
detail as well

98
00:05:10,729 --> 00:05:13,729
there's an again there's been an
increase in law enforcement activity

99
00:05:13,729 --> 00:05:14,380
surrounding

100
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:18,030
to all this and the emergence and
there's been an emergency

101
00:05:18,030 --> 00:05:21,789
peer to peer crypto currencies like
pecan but there's been a surprising lack

102
00:05:21,789 --> 00:05:23,310
of interest from the underground

103
00:05:23,310 --> 00:05:26,910
armpit has really but has a really
completely taken off

104
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:33,830
are and that's probably a good thing cuz
like that things can be done with pickle

105
00:05:33,830 --> 00:05:38,000
I love the new attack vector Java most
new exploit kits

106
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,590
specifically the back all exploit kit
that now make use

107
00:05:41,590 --> 00:05:45,259
love for Java vulnerabilities which are
have which are released

108
00:05:45,259 --> 00:05:48,680
and Oracle is very very slow to patch
they have

109
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:52,120
pretty slow arm a patching cycle so

110
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:55,190
it could be up several weeks to several
months from the time upon a village

111
00:05:55,190 --> 00:05:58,229
discloses high moral gets around
actually patching

112
00:05:58,229 --> 00:06:01,830
so that window of opportunity %uh is is

113
00:06:01,830 --> 00:06:05,240
very large and attackers are leveraging
that window of opportunity

114
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:08,530
and developing exploit a java-based and

115
00:06:08,530 --> 00:06:12,509
including them into automated exploit
kits for things like drive-by downloads

116
00:06:12,509 --> 00:06:15,539
the new version a black hole a
advertises the

117
00:06:15,539 --> 00:06:22,539
to advertise a job or ability arm as a
reported on on Krebs on security dot com

118
00:06:23,810 --> 00:06:28,030
and automated Ryan loss after the rise
as automated fried shop

119
00:06:28,030 --> 00:06:31,410
these are basic PHP my SQL scripts

120
00:06:31,410 --> 00:06:35,860
that are that sell digital goods except
in this case the digital gate goods are

121
00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:36,620
usually

122
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:40,419
credit card numbers mag stripe data Pay
Pal loggins

123
00:06:40,419 --> 00:06:44,990
email accounts or are basically have any
other type of bomb

124
00:06:44,990 --> 00:06:48,800
collected credential that can be used
for for some type of Roger activity

125
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:52,160
the way these workers a user or users
will either pay a fee to join

126
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:55,490
the site that the usually heard about it
from a karting former something like

127
00:06:55,490 --> 00:06:56,060
that

128
00:06:56,060 --> 00:06:59,940
Orlando though but though you have to
pay a fee to even register

129
00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:03,039
to be able to access the site and want
to pay that fee they can find their

130
00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:03,830
account

131
00:07:03,830 --> 00:07:07,800
and a start adding items to their
shopping cart and checkout with the

132
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:11,400
with anonymous an anonymous be currency
a in

133
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:14,419
usually get home didn't get away with
the feel

134
00:07:14,419 --> 00:07:19,440
several good man a credit card numbers
for depending on a shot between two

135
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:23,560
to five dollars apiece or their seven to
eight or ten dollars

136
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:27,349
by the piece for for European cards and
arm

137
00:07:27,349 --> 00:07:30,650
the scripts originally were exclusively

138
00:07:30,650 --> 00:07:33,840
private scripts that were army at

139
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:37,479
be there by yet to buy it from a
developer on a cartoon form but as time

140
00:07:37,479 --> 00:07:38,318
goes on

141
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:42,380
fewer customers get discover rattled and
scripts get leaked

142
00:07:42,380 --> 00:07:45,569
so now on these have scripts are freely
available

143
00:07:45,569 --> 00:07:49,660
show a few look around forms people are
giving them away people or

144
00:07:49,660 --> 00:07:53,349
on their been hacked ones that have been
released and %uh several

145
00:07:53,349 --> 00:07:56,520
on the most popular shops have been
breached on by

146
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:59,690
pretty much everywhere everyone in the
book everyone's been

147
00:07:59,690 --> 00:08:03,030
been it the sites because they're their

148
00:08:03,030 --> 00:08:06,789
a trove both you know pirate digital

149
00:08:06,789 --> 00:08:10,419
booty and intelligence for both the

150
00:08:10,419 --> 00:08:13,919
scary consultants and law enforcement
arm most recent

151
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:16,979
raid was a operation card shops took
place

152
00:08:16,979 --> 00:08:20,080
and June love this year where the FBI

153
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:23,169
did a sweeping arrested a 24 people who
were engaged in

154
00:08:23,169 --> 00:08:26,490
carting activity some people are also
running automated shops

155
00:08:26,490 --> 00:08:29,830
and the they also had a created a
honeypot form

156
00:08:29,830 --> 00:08:33,059
are called carter's profit that was run
by the FBI

157
00:08:33,060 --> 00:08:37,169
and basically just kinda set back and
watched as scars from all over came

158
00:08:37,169 --> 00:08:39,059
stargazing and transactions

159
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:45,100
and then they close up shop in June in
May 24 arrests

160
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:49,360
I'm one one notable breach took place
during the spring of 2011

161
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:53,839
are a French it that has reported on a a
french-language information security

162
00:08:53,839 --> 00:08:54,620
block

163
00:08:54,620 --> 00:08:58,310
apparently a French actor was able to
breach I credit card

164
00:08:58,310 --> 00:09:01,769
selling shop and farm once they've
reached that they were able to obtain

165
00:09:01,769 --> 00:09:05,550
the actual PHP scripts for the shop and
a MySQL database

166
00:09:05,550 --> 00:09:09,290
and with that they're able to get
administrative actors to the application

167
00:09:09,290 --> 00:09:12,399
list of all the users are the shop all
their passwords

168
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:16,190
and all that transaction data as well

169
00:09:16,190 --> 00:09:19,660
they've arm where the breach a

170
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:23,149
spread pretty quickly up it was a pretty
poor prominent

171
00:09:23,149 --> 00:09:27,290
site those on the did was discussed on
pace bit various other underground

172
00:09:27,290 --> 00:09:28,649
forums

173
00:09:28,649 --> 00:09:31,910
on when this was going on summer
researchers act Miami

174
00:09:31,910 --> 00:09:36,610
were able to obtain screenshot sourby
posts on the forms by some by the person

175
00:09:36,610 --> 00:09:40,700
who had done the breaches and you glad
they are

176
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:44,730
were able to up it basically are able to
see the statistics

177
00:09:44,730 --> 00:09:48,029
from the administrative panel which gave

178
00:09:48,029 --> 00:09:51,810
which gives a good snapshot as to the
skill the underground economy

179
00:09:51,810 --> 00:09:54,700
that's going on especially when this is
just me take into account that this is

180
00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:55,060
just

181
00:09:55,060 --> 00:09:58,519
a single website and there are hundreds
of them out and

182
00:09:58,519 --> 00:10:03,019
so let's look at let's look at some
statistics

183
00:10:03,019 --> 00:10:07,790
arm the this is the class this is the
statistics paddle from the car shop from

184
00:10:07,790 --> 00:10:11,120
the administrator palette you know they
can log in and manage their sales and

185
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:12,660
see exactly what they're doing

186
00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:16,140
arm from between a parole 2010

187
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:20,269
enable 2012 there where there was over
six hundred thousand dollars

188
00:10:20,269 --> 00:10:24,060
worth of data that was sold the problem
on the on the site

189
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:27,350
through through Liberty Reserve econ see
on their

190
00:10:27,350 --> 00:10:33,870
looks like they're their largest the the
most busy month was

191
00:10:33,870 --> 00:10:40,410
was August and September 2010 that's
when the the peaks they made about

192
00:10:40,410 --> 00:10:43,769
about a hundred a on close to two
hundred thousand dollars just in those

193
00:10:43,769 --> 00:10:44,870
10 months

194
00:10:44,870 --> 00:10:48,740
and there the rest alone and the rest as
much as kinda had a trickle of

195
00:10:48,740 --> 00:10:52,140
as our by I guess is they got into to
other things

196
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:56,250
arm the most most the time the the
people running the shops

197
00:10:56,250 --> 00:10:59,680
art hackers themselves they're simply
are buying up

198
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:03,870
a book databases from hackers and
including as inventory in the shop in

199
00:11:03,870 --> 00:11:07,730
marking up the price

200
00:11:07,730 --> 00:11:11,300
here's another statistical analysis from
the from the shop

201
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:14,540
on this was the top users the top 10
purchasers

202
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:19,160
about 9 percent the business from for
the entire shock came from the top

203
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:23,480
came from the top 10 users and over the
course of the year just those 10 users

204
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:26,920
spent about fifty five thousand dollars
up on this

205
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:32,180
a bank records from the site

206
00:11:32,180 --> 00:11:35,910
and the administrators obviously sloppy
which is why we will be looking at the

207
00:11:35,910 --> 00:11:37,149
statistics today

208
00:11:37,149 --> 00:11:40,360
arm they were able to do it for some
reason the

209
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:43,570
appeared to have a backup file called
test that tax

210
00:11:43,570 --> 00:11:47,290
the head every single Liberty Reserve
transaction had ever taken place on the

211
00:11:47,290 --> 00:11:48,079
website

212
00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:51,769
destination account numbers a where the
counter at the way it goes

213
00:11:51,769 --> 00:11:56,000
my funder coming from the the batch idea
the transaction

214
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,310
and the amount that was for so basically
any

215
00:11:59,310 --> 00:12:02,310
anyone who ever by a credit card number
from the site

216
00:12:02,310 --> 00:12:06,950
there in their a confirmation was
available for public viewing just by

217
00:12:06,950 --> 00:12:07,920
browsing to test

218
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:14,060
that text on this shop

219
00:12:14,060 --> 00:12:17,420
and in addition to make such as that
we've had

220
00:12:17,420 --> 00:12:20,750
things like Zeus and spy that evolved
that have

221
00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:23,959
a been leaked through various

222
00:12:23,959 --> 00:12:27,470
public publicly accessible on our forums
the

223
00:12:27,470 --> 00:12:31,300
the other there's been a significant
increase

224
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:35,000
I N in fact and infections and the

225
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:38,089
participation in these communities
overall because these

226
00:12:38,089 --> 00:12:42,010
previously a private kits are now
publicly available for free

227
00:12:42,010 --> 00:12:45,490
whereas these cost a few hundred to a
few thousand dollars you can just down

228
00:12:45,490 --> 00:12:46,829
live and play with them

229
00:12:46,829 --> 00:12:50,750
and arm again most to the public
releases

230
00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:54,279
a contain back doors because they're
releasing them

231
00:12:54,279 --> 00:12:58,240
with the intention %uh being able to
take over apartments once people have

232
00:12:58,240 --> 00:12:59,540
started using the tools and

233
00:12:59,540 --> 00:13:02,680
and making it work and of

234
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:05,430
also because these are now publicly
available you have an entire community

235
00:13:05,430 --> 00:13:06,790
dedicated to

236
00:13:06,790 --> 00:13:10,399
researching about the scripts and code

237
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:13,450
looking for vulnerabilities within the
command and control servers and there's

238
00:13:13,450 --> 00:13:14,050
been

239
00:13:14,050 --> 00:13:17,220
many that have been discovered and
publicly released that will be going

240
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:20,639
over several others

241
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:23,950
here some zoos wanna bilities and and
again all these marvellous are going to

242
00:13:23,950 --> 00:13:25,029
be discussing

243
00:13:25,029 --> 00:13:28,329
arm try them in a lab environment we've
got one downstairs on the mezzanine

244
00:13:28,329 --> 00:13:29,110
level

245
00:13:29,110 --> 00:13:32,170
all these kids are set up you can run
these exploits against them and see how

246
00:13:32,170 --> 00:13:33,420
they work

247
00:13:33,420 --> 00:13:36,740
arms use has a remote file upload
vulnerability

248
00:13:36,740 --> 00:13:40,850
previously this was a just circulated
among very small

249
00:13:40,850 --> 00:13:44,540
communities people arm mostly within the
security industry and

250
00:13:44,540 --> 00:13:48,279
are also within the underground arm
basically when

251
00:13:48,279 --> 00:13:52,089
jus communicates to the crowd control
server it says and encrypt the POST

252
00:13:52,089 --> 00:13:52,670
request

253
00:13:52,670 --> 00:13:56,690
and then encrypt the POST request will
write a file to the server that has all

254
00:13:56,690 --> 00:13:58,199
their key log data and

255
00:13:58,199 --> 00:14:02,040
the stuff that that children be
collected from the machine from by

256
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:06,319
impersonating a pot and sending a POST
request that's encrypt it with the key

257
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:07,300
from the server

258
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:10,600
which can and you can you text you can
obtain the key

259
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:14,740
for Zeus the encryption key either by
extracting it from where the binaries

260
00:14:14,740 --> 00:14:17,769
or just with a simple brute force attack
are mute a few

261
00:14:17,769 --> 00:14:22,199
encrypts a POST request sending it to
the gate that PHP drop zone for Zeus

262
00:14:22,199 --> 00:14:26,430
for Zeus it's possible to write php
files executables

263
00:14:26,430 --> 00:14:29,620
arm files to the server and if you can

264
00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:33,170
browse if you can browse directly to the
report a directory and find where the

265
00:14:33,170 --> 00:14:34,040
file is

266
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:37,540
you'll be able to execute it and you get
like a CIA nine are 57 whatever you've

267
00:14:37,540 --> 00:14:38,380
uploaded to the

268
00:14:38,380 --> 00:14:41,880
to the server to execute just by
accessing it arm

269
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:45,279
if you up Alyssa we've but its

270
00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:49,240
very possible are the few brief you
browse through other reports directories

271
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:49,889
are on

272
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:53,790
on Nov various public to respond that's
if there are publicly accessible

273
00:14:53,790 --> 00:14:57,480
there's a good chance you gonna find CIA
nine are 57 shows it off

274
00:14:57,480 --> 00:15:00,709
that are already there and over his
kindness feel

275
00:15:00,709 --> 00:15:04,449
CE a see the that the compromise though

276
00:15:04,449 --> 00:15:08,620
by as as is and um back in fall 2010

277
00:15:08,620 --> 00:15:11,889
security researcher Dan Billy reels from
excess

278
00:15:11,889 --> 00:15:15,680
national bird or a him put out a a very

279
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:19,139
very cool tool it's a PHP script that
will

280
00:15:19,139 --> 00:15:22,519
emulate though POST request but upload

281
00:15:22,519 --> 00:15:25,690
a file to a two issues botnet so you can

282
00:15:25,690 --> 00:15:29,500
if you know the encryption key you can
so you can just pop it into the script

283
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:30,649
or even senator

284
00:15:30,649 --> 00:15:34,209
very little tweaking on to make a brute
force a script or just settin

285
00:15:34,209 --> 00:15:37,680
try to extract it from the binary and
arm we also

286
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:41,779
up and in addition regarding a check in
the key from the binary

287
00:15:41,779 --> 00:15:45,899
there's a up a blog on thread expert
called a

288
00:15:45,899 --> 00:15:51,310
almighty Zeus that describes the process
of extracting the encryption key from

289
00:15:51,310 --> 00:15:55,730
up from May's is binary so that combined
with bill you reassess tool

290
00:15:55,730 --> 00:16:00,509
a can arm result and compromising was a
spot on it again

291
00:16:00,509 --> 00:16:04,079
don't do this in the wild that its
attacking a server

292
00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:09,620
you go downstairs and you won't go to
jail and it's much more fun

293
00:16:09,620 --> 00:16:14,009
a spy I had a multiple SQL injection
vulnerabilities that have been

294
00:16:14,009 --> 00:16:19,170
thereof recently been public made public
on their blind SQL injections on

295
00:16:19,170 --> 00:16:23,560
those two files a form find wraps up to
inform cards at it

296
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:26,850
the ID parameters are on sanitized and

297
00:16:26,850 --> 00:16:30,560
love soaps the barbel to SQL injection

298
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:34,600
arm there's a been a blog that was also
written by a bigass

299
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:38,339
section H E and the were they've

300
00:16:38,339 --> 00:16:42,199
go step by step on extracting database
information

301
00:16:42,199 --> 00:16:45,519
from up from the spy I database to the
SQL

302
00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:49,740
to SQL injection attack up there's two
vectors attacked they can use

303
00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:53,730
arm with an SQL injection inspire you
can use the SQL injection to read

304
00:16:53,730 --> 00:16:55,709
configuration files on the server

305
00:16:55,709 --> 00:17:00,380
and Paul appall credentials our way or
you can use it to read the database info

306
00:17:00,380 --> 00:17:02,470
crash that way depends on how the

307
00:17:02,470 --> 00:17:09,439
spy administrators set as set it up but
again only do it in my lap

308
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:14,069
on other crime where kids up have also
had %uh public Mon abilities the Eleanor

309
00:17:14,069 --> 00:17:14,859
exploit kit

310
00:17:14,860 --> 00:17:18,549
which show with to discuss to about two
years ago one more popular exploit kits

311
00:17:18,549 --> 00:17:19,689
in 2010

312
00:17:19,689 --> 00:17:24,270
they at now has a public SQL injection
vulnerability sup a PDF was released on

313
00:17:24,270 --> 00:17:26,500
exploit d be caught hacking miss kitty's

314
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:30,299
which is about which is about taking
over Eleanor exploit kits

315
00:17:30,299 --> 00:17:35,100
and the black energy de dos botnet also
has a SQL injection vulnerability that

316
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:35,730
allows you to

317
00:17:35,730 --> 00:17:39,190
to dump entries from the database and
that was also

318
00:17:39,190 --> 00:17:43,410
released by by Billy Rios the same
researcher who released the

319
00:17:43,410 --> 00:17:46,960
the as use back door and they are on
again only do

320
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:51,030
why haven't you added stuff and a lab

321
00:17:51,030 --> 00:17:54,320
and there's been no a resurgence love
love

322
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:58,189
good dedust side should be
denial-of-service arm

323
00:17:58,190 --> 00:18:01,700
has as become more prevalent within the
last two years

324
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:04,830
mostly due to the to the rise above love

325
00:18:04,830 --> 00:18:08,230
activism causes and and various global
movement

326
00:18:08,230 --> 00:18:11,460
that are that are using the DOS as a
protest or

327
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:14,700
arm the the use of traditional Mauer
based

328
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:18,240
up but that's that connect de dos a
things like

329
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:22,679
things like dirt jumper that is a or or
those boards cool RC botnet centered

330
00:18:22,679 --> 00:18:28,010
that do I'll adidas attacks those merged
the concept adopted botnets

331
00:18:28,010 --> 00:18:31,379
and those are tools allow let go will be
going to

332
00:18:31,380 --> 00:18:34,710
like the high over I am cannon and the
low orbit ion cannon which

333
00:18:34,710 --> 00:18:38,010
specifically arm are one

334
00:18:38,010 --> 00:18:42,470
wanna single user denial a service tools
that become distributed that data

335
00:18:42,470 --> 00:18:45,539
service line of participants are

336
00:18:45,539 --> 00:18:49,210
gather for the attack and the my eyes
was dead earlier

337
00:18:49,210 --> 00:18:53,830
the bar has forward the technical a
barrier to entry has significantly been

338
00:18:53,830 --> 00:18:54,320
lowered

339
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:57,600
for attackers wishing to participate in
the da's attacks because

340
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:01,880
the toolkits and scripts are available
now are incredibly simple to use and

341
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:05,700
very poon

342
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:09,309
um dirt jumper was is a powerful arm

343
00:19:09,309 --> 00:19:13,480
but that talk it that was released
publicly at the end

344
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:16,679
2011 it was available in private a since

345
00:19:16,679 --> 00:19:20,470
about January of 2011 for sale selling
for about six hundred bucks and then

346
00:19:20,470 --> 00:19:22,250
again it got leaked around October

347
00:19:22,250 --> 00:19:25,289
army was made a as a spinoff

348
00:19:25,289 --> 00:19:28,220
from the risk a strain on our it's a
it's definitely a Russian but that's

349
00:19:28,220 --> 00:19:29,950
very stripped down and simple

350
00:19:29,950 --> 00:19:33,980
arm it's a breads primarily the way arm

351
00:19:33,980 --> 00:19:37,429
mostly people get affected with his they
want they want I just get hit with a

352
00:19:37,429 --> 00:19:38,900
drive-by download an already

353
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:42,179
and I just get hit their jumper the
usually already be infected with some

354
00:19:42,179 --> 00:19:43,140
kind of an hour

355
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:46,169
and a jumper or just be a paleo that
pushed out to a later on

356
00:19:46,169 --> 00:19:49,179
and they want to be able to when they
want to be realized

357
00:19:49,179 --> 00:19:52,360
d DoS attack from their already existing
about that

358
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:56,960
on that commander CNC panel of butter
jumpers actually fairly secure

359
00:19:56,960 --> 00:20:00,120
you can even access the login page
unless you know the user name and send

360
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:01,299
it in to get requests

361
00:20:01,299 --> 00:20:04,720
and it's got fake 404 errors all over so
for trying to fingerprint it with a

362
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:05,700
fuzzy ortho

363
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:09,340
web putting up his W foes it's gonna
it's gonna give you arm

364
00:20:09,340 --> 00:20:12,649
a seemingly legitimate 404 responses

365
00:20:12,650 --> 00:20:15,990
but they're their subtle differences
between the

366
00:20:15,990 --> 00:20:19,309
real for 4 responses and the dirt jumper
generator for for responses

367
00:20:19,309 --> 00:20:22,789
see kinda get a feel for if if there is
an actual 'em

368
00:20:22,789 --> 00:20:27,110
scum actual server there it advertise
that makes use of four different attack

369
00:20:27,110 --> 00:20:27,919
methods

370
00:20:27,919 --> 00:20:33,080
I know when we torn apart coretta
already be lectured

371
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:37,080
on we discovered that for the most part
harry just get floods and post leads

372
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:40,399
it's up to you though have several
different a

373
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:43,740
names attacks by when you look at the
traffic

374
00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:47,909
just to get flood and it'll make you sir
I will try to randomize the HTTP headers

375
00:20:47,909 --> 00:20:49,200
the reefers

376
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:54,789
arm the you're mostly that mostly refers
and the user agents to try to avoid

377
00:20:54,789 --> 00:20:56,789
detection make it look like legitimate
traffic

378
00:20:56,789 --> 00:21:01,669
arm but I again it's it always has
static signatures so we we

379
00:21:01,669 --> 00:21:05,380
put together a very comprehensive
analysis ovett army can

380
00:21:05,380 --> 00:21:09,419
but the we have a mitigation signatures
available to the public as well

381
00:21:09,419 --> 00:21:12,980
on that project dot com forward slash de
dos dash

382
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:16,100
third dashed our jeopardy HTML are we

383
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:20,210
do really is periodic threat advisories
that right reverse engineer these

384
00:21:20,210 --> 00:21:21,340
toolkits and

385
00:21:21,340 --> 00:21:24,770
discuss what they do how they work and
best ways to mitigate them on your

386
00:21:24,770 --> 00:21:25,429
network and

387
00:21:25,429 --> 00:21:28,909
there that's available free to the
public from politic dot com

388
00:21:28,909 --> 00:21:34,429
arm from the threat advisory section

389
00:21:34,429 --> 00:21:38,640
here's an image of the the dirt jumper
Control Panel against a very stripped

390
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:39,630
down interface

391
00:21:39,630 --> 00:21:43,340
said has 1 a.m. only has a couple and
puts I'm

392
00:21:43,340 --> 00:21:48,559
where the target URL how many threads or
flows do you want a machine to run it

393
00:21:48,559 --> 00:21:52,010
that run against it and then there's a
start/stop button

394
00:21:52,010 --> 00:21:55,020
as a screenshot from version 3 when we
did the

395
00:21:55,020 --> 00:21:59,039
when we did the analysis that's what
that was the version that was publicly

396
00:21:59,039 --> 00:21:59,520
leaked

397
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:03,039
sense we've released the the threat
advisory dirt jumper 5

398
00:22:03,039 --> 00:22:07,789
has come out and advertises that it has
an anti Diaz mitigation feature

399
00:22:07,789 --> 00:22:10,840
that randomize additional headers during
a post-flood

400
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:15,379
are made that it at was seem to be more
hype than actual

401
00:22:15,380 --> 00:22:19,090
than an actual threat regarding be able
to be does make Asian because

402
00:22:19,090 --> 00:22:22,260
all it did was add an extra
randomization field on the post-flood

403
00:22:22,260 --> 00:22:24,150
and called it an anti dust flood

404
00:22:24,150 --> 00:22:27,240
so it it's miles mostly just a Mar

405
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:30,480
since we mostly just a marketing
technique

406
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:34,010
and O also

407
00:22:34,010 --> 00:22:37,080
the also as though that's come out
within the last autumn

408
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:40,658
out became prevalent within the last a
couple years has been Buddha scripts

409
00:22:40,659 --> 00:22:44,070
on these are used and denial of service
attack saddam's

410
00:22:44,070 --> 00:22:47,539
daddy doesn't tax that arm there's
simple

411
00:22:47,539 --> 00:22:51,760
stripped-down PHP or ASP files as just a
single file their

412
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:54,770
prevail even go to pace been a tight boo
description OC

413
00:22:54,770 --> 00:22:58,620
dozens of examples of them are
essentially all they're doing

414
00:22:58,620 --> 00:23:02,809
descending get floods or you TP floods

415
00:23:02,809 --> 00:23:06,080
and they're incredibly simple to use up
you

416
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:10,199
you can get a what a lot of arm novice a
novice attacker doing

417
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:13,820
as attain these public a booter scripts
from from my

418
00:23:13,820 --> 00:23:16,908
there are four or more pastebin then
they'll just signed up with a buncha

419
00:23:16,909 --> 00:23:17,860
free hosts

420
00:23:17,860 --> 00:23:21,600
put the file on the free hosts and said
it started acting at Target

421
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:25,950
and eventually free hosts kinda catch on
to that setup centuries publicly no

422
00:23:25,950 --> 00:23:26,570
shells

423
00:23:26,570 --> 00:23:29,939
not all of them are doing it so good so
we pre effective for short periods of

424
00:23:29,940 --> 00:23:30,620
time

425
00:23:30,620 --> 00:23:34,150
but arm through very simple web
application vulnerabilities

426
00:23:34,150 --> 00:23:37,659
attackers are also up living these files
to web servers so

427
00:23:37,659 --> 00:23:43,169
us so basically what happens is through
us a simple remote file inclusion or any

428
00:23:43,169 --> 00:23:44,480
way to write about a server

429
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:48,120
arm attackers able to take convert that

430
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:52,470
that server through a single file upload
internet and use all the bandwidth

431
00:23:52,470 --> 00:23:56,970
from that server in adidas attack which
is significantly more powerful detecting

432
00:23:56,970 --> 00:23:58,289
a bunch of workstations

433
00:23:58,289 --> 00:24:01,408
arm with the with mouth with peace in
our

434
00:24:01,409 --> 00:24:05,450
and having them work altogether so
basically it ok with less effort

435
00:24:05,450 --> 00:24:10,580
to to spread these up %um busy attackers
be able to use less machine center

436
00:24:10,580 --> 00:24:11,600
easier to in fact

437
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:14,760
to do more to do more powerful attacks

438
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:19,460
and Buddha scripts are are a big reason
for this some we have some screenshots

439
00:24:19,460 --> 00:24:21,029
of what they actually look like 10

440
00:24:21,029 --> 00:24:24,320
and what that their interfaces are arm

441
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:28,049
a lot you can get these long lists of
blue shells at just circulate on

442
00:24:28,049 --> 00:24:28,720
pastebin

443
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:33,529
and are they there are programs called
bootloaders which are either stand-alone

444
00:24:33,529 --> 00:24:35,789
clients written by a young people were

445
00:24:35,789 --> 00:24:39,059
usually just getting into to programming
or arm

446
00:24:39,059 --> 00:24:42,668
these web application based bootloaders
where you can just feed a list

447
00:24:42,669 --> 00:24:46,090
love above the shells into into the
bootloader

448
00:24:46,090 --> 00:24:50,000
and given the target and it'll it'll
start heading home of and what what's

449
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:53,279
interesting about the the communication
methods are these these traditional

450
00:24:53,279 --> 00:24:57,710
about its like dirt jumpers arm our base
are rely on the commanding

451
00:24:57,710 --> 00:25:01,210
rely on command control server Shoham

452
00:25:01,210 --> 00:25:04,279
who actually rely on the infected client
to connect back to the

453
00:25:04,279 --> 00:25:05,490
command-and-control server

454
00:25:05,490 --> 00:25:08,929
and receive instructions whereas these
sick quietly

455
00:25:08,929 --> 00:25:13,190
awaiting to receive instructions from
the attacker or the bootloader

456
00:25:13,190 --> 00:25:16,440
and the the only way that we see those
instructions if you know where they're

457
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:17,960
actually located

458
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:21,520
and third there's an entire economy
based around these where hackers will

459
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:22,770
just go around in fact

460
00:25:22,770 --> 00:25:25,779
effecting web servers dropping better
script shows

461
00:25:25,779 --> 00:25:29,090
and the seller lists two people want to
be able to use the DoS attacks likely

462
00:25:29,090 --> 00:25:29,678
don't know how to

463
00:25:29,679 --> 00:25:32,700
you don't know how to do a web
application tak here's a list for a few

464
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:35,880
bucks you can just use this list to
start attacking these web sites

465
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:40,669
and again he lectured is Donna a
comprehensive analysis of several

466
00:25:40,669 --> 00:25:44,400
butter scripts how they work the the
economy that surrounds them

467
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:48,870
and the the entire p.m. good script
kiddie seeing that surrounds it but it's

468
00:25:48,870 --> 00:25:49,529
actually

469
00:25:49,529 --> 00:25:52,750
pretty sophisticated and pretty and

470
00:25:52,750 --> 00:25:56,770
way more powerful than it should be
because of how r because I've

471
00:25:56,770 --> 00:25:59,559
the the amount down with that the
scripts are able to utilize from copper

472
00:25:59,559 --> 00:26:01,270
my servers

473
00:26:01,270 --> 00:26:06,620
and that's after letting back on 4/28
advisers that HTML

474
00:26:06,620 --> 00:26:10,370
here's a screenshot of the green shell
booter script very simple

475
00:26:10,370 --> 00:26:12,020
straightforward php file

476
00:26:12,020 --> 00:26:15,740
part is uploaded to the server on task
force the destination

477
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:19,409
and the length of time he went on the
attack for and all this does is send the

478
00:26:19,409 --> 00:26:20,350
UTPA fled

479
00:26:20,350 --> 00:26:23,840
so if if farm you don't wanna have to

480
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:28,690
even use the euro is this little goin to
face you can just send a GET request

481
00:26:28,690 --> 00:26:31,850
well love your green showed up PHP

482
00:26:31,850 --> 00:26:35,440
question mark target equals and time

483
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:39,970
people's and then what essentially what
bootloaders do is all just send those

484
00:26:39,970 --> 00:26:42,690
commands to the entire list shells and

485
00:26:42,690 --> 00:26:45,900
you then you're able to leverage our
pretty powerful

486
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:50,909
adidas attack using incredibly simple
tools techniques at really shouldn't

487
00:26:50,909 --> 00:26:51,350
work

488
00:26:51,350 --> 00:26:54,990
and 22 well but they are they're gaining
wat way more prevalent

489
00:26:54,990 --> 00:26:59,320
because the its their easier to do more
people are using them

490
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:03,059
and this is this is the result nah man
what what's another stick thing about

491
00:27:03,059 --> 00:27:05,570
the green shell booter script it's a
it's not displaying

492
00:27:05,570 --> 00:27:10,070
here I but there's a broken image within
the green showboat a script that used to

493
00:27:10,070 --> 00:27:11,320
be a big pot leaf

494
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:14,779
and I was hosted on: a host on the
server

495
00:27:14,779 --> 00:27:18,270
won the why I guess I'm guessing when
the authors are the script so

496
00:27:18,270 --> 00:27:22,289
what would happen is every person who
would use this tool and drop a show on a

497
00:27:22,289 --> 00:27:22,789
server

498
00:27:22,789 --> 00:27:26,549
a time would be accessed the image-maker
requests to the

499
00:27:26,549 --> 00:27:29,789
to the service being hosted so I wrote
the script is just getting all these

500
00:27:29,789 --> 00:27:31,190
nice long list serve

501
00:27:31,190 --> 00:27:34,289
up infected machines and thats

502
00:27:34,289 --> 00:27:39,710
fairly common with the lady is a allow
the scripts

503
00:27:39,710 --> 00:27:43,549
and we're talked a little bit about our
opted indeed %uh stools

504
00:27:43,549 --> 00:27:46,820
on this is the low orbit ion cannon are
missus

505
00:27:46,820 --> 00:27:50,879
it's got a lot of people arrested cuz
has no support for proxies whatsoever

506
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:54,460
and most people don't know how to use to
arrive using it didn't know enough to

507
00:27:54,460 --> 00:27:55,580
use BP ends

508
00:27:55,580 --> 00:27:59,689
arm it is simply use its just a very
simple get flood very

509
00:27:59,690 --> 00:28:02,980
this trip down here is nothing that
fancy crashes a lot

510
00:28:02,980 --> 00:28:06,710
not arm it'd especially when he's a high
thread count it only becomes effective

511
00:28:06,710 --> 00:28:07,600
when you have

512
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:10,770
large amounts of people arm coordinating

513
00:28:10,770 --> 00:28:15,179
to but to use as an attack like with the
leg with the anonymous campaigns

514
00:28:15,179 --> 00:28:18,770
and um what was I was real funny is
during those campaigns when this was

515
00:28:18,770 --> 00:28:19,809
circulating among

516
00:28:19,809 --> 00:28:24,570
I among those groups IRC lobby were back
doing them what to do this because

517
00:28:24,570 --> 00:28:28,559
why not and everyone who is
participating attack became part of

518
00:28:28,559 --> 00:28:34,658
larger botnet is the high orbit ion
cannon

519
00:28:34,659 --> 00:28:38,830
very similar to low orbit ion cannon
just the the next generation ovett

520
00:28:38,830 --> 00:28:41,899
ass makes you serve a booster scripts
which are these a

521
00:28:41,899 --> 00:28:46,390
visual VB script files able to feed into
the tool that are basically

522
00:28:46,390 --> 00:28:50,990
less %uh randomized headers and program
is headers like refers

523
00:28:50,990 --> 00:28:54,279
user-agent: and that has the

524
00:28:54,279 --> 00:28:58,240
attempt to bypass any type of medication
error detection

525
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:02,230
but I i again it its crashes a lot Its
pretty poorly coded

526
00:29:02,230 --> 00:29:06,470
arm its it has no support for proxies
and is only effective

527
00:29:06,470 --> 00:29:10,179
when you using it with a large group of
people and coordinating and we've also

528
00:29:10,179 --> 00:29:10,799
got a

529
00:29:10,799 --> 00:29:14,299
comprehensive farm analysis %uh love
this tool

530
00:29:14,299 --> 00:29:17,520
and then reversed it and that's
available on the political advisors

531
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:20,029
section

532
00:29:20,029 --> 00:29:24,200
a recently in the news arms Emrah has
been getting a bit of press

533
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:29,140
its it got a lot of hype because it's
seemingly combines the features as you

534
00:29:29,140 --> 00:29:30,090
since by I

535
00:29:30,090 --> 00:29:33,640
with the with de dos capabilities which
was

536
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:36,640
fairly which is fairly innovative had a
really been

537
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:39,809
been seen a a.m. to be a that

538
00:29:39,809 --> 00:29:44,279
popular combination arm it's based off
the cecum our kit

539
00:29:44,279 --> 00:29:47,720
almost identical on database structure
and user and and

540
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:52,570
credit roll user interface arm they make
some pretty impressive claims

541
00:29:52,570 --> 00:29:56,760
about the tool I in there and the
advertisements on on under reforms

542
00:29:56,760 --> 00:29:59,960
to the point where it's a bit suspicious
as to the if this is actually

543
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:03,750
a functional tool for example is only
selling for 100 dollars

544
00:30:03,750 --> 00:30:06,860
and compared to the market price of
other tools

545
00:30:06,860 --> 00:30:10,429
that is way too cheap for something that
supposedly has ease

546
00:30:10,429 --> 00:30:14,570
has these features and also has the
ability to spread via USB infection

547
00:30:14,570 --> 00:30:18,460
arms just that alone flag fly something
that there's this

548
00:30:18,460 --> 00:30:22,419
not something legit about this crime or
product

549
00:30:22,419 --> 00:30:25,610
and update the torso released for
private sale

550
00:30:25,610 --> 00:30:29,279
I'd say about about April or may Andrew

551
00:30:29,279 --> 00:30:32,730
with an a few weeks it was already
leaked and the

552
00:30:32,730 --> 00:30:35,870
code was to build a coat on the C&C
power cord was available

553
00:30:35,870 --> 00:30:39,640
so that all that that and why when you
go to go to shows that

554
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:43,460
the its a lot according to have been
ripped from things like the sea

555
00:30:43,460 --> 00:30:46,880
on our kid but it could've been the same
author but the is also ripped from some

556
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:47,710
other arm

557
00:30:47,710 --> 00:30:51,750
portion to rip some other popular German
botnet a

558
00:30:51,750 --> 00:30:55,220
but that's as well so that's pretty
common among an experienced

559
00:30:55,220 --> 00:30:58,929
our colors are just borrow code from
from a other projects

560
00:30:58,929 --> 00:31:02,279
and sensors no copy protection licensing

561
00:31:02,279 --> 00:31:06,039
or any other fatty things that now exist
in crime where kids

562
00:31:06,039 --> 00:31:09,690
arm there it shows up there someone
experienced and up

563
00:31:09,690 --> 00:31:13,500
that's another thing that developed the
last year's a licensing for

564
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:17,330
for crime where kids are went to the
point where it's you know

565
00:31:17,330 --> 00:31:20,740
and it's the appeared this PHP scripts
will be encoded you came in cm

566
00:31:20,740 --> 00:31:23,830
it's just you know it's it's bill dan
coated

567
00:31:23,830 --> 00:31:27,570
to your server Antonio I'll work with
your server and they'll have these

568
00:31:27,570 --> 00:31:31,408
managed Update Services at all just push
out the update still when it's ready and

569
00:31:31,409 --> 00:31:33,260
I'll be based in countries where there
is

570
00:31:33,260 --> 00:31:36,610
absolutely nothing that can be done
about that and %ah

571
00:31:36,610 --> 00:31:39,740
another interesting thing about the
there's ever a leak which is common to

572
00:31:39,740 --> 00:31:42,090
most other league products

573
00:31:42,090 --> 00:31:46,230
they're all back toward by default with
the most obvious back door

574
00:31:46,230 --> 00:31:52,059
that's I've ever I've ever seen I if you
just go to System command that PHP

575
00:31:52,059 --> 00:31:55,210
it's a PHP CMD

576
00:31:55,210 --> 00:31:59,940
comanche from Jess question marks and
equals cat at sea password

577
00:31:59,940 --> 00:32:03,059
any command and that's it you you've got
it then

578
00:32:03,059 --> 00:32:07,200
most evil people using his to dump
integration thousand yet login creds and

579
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:10,470
and they can take over the takeover
about that so

580
00:32:10,470 --> 00:32:15,090
basically and what I'm what I assume is
that the person who leaked this talk hit

581
00:32:15,090 --> 00:32:19,179
arm was just looking to take over other
credit control panels

582
00:32:19,179 --> 00:32:22,919
and arm noble cause it seems to be
worked out a buncha

583
00:32:22,919 --> 00:32:26,940
think how much a press so I'm I'm sure
they're I'm sure they're doing that

584
00:32:26,940 --> 00:32:30,299
and arm that was just the one that

585
00:32:30,299 --> 00:32:34,309
were able to see just by looking at the
files like commander papeete what's this

586
00:32:34,309 --> 00:32:38,710
I'll so like I'm sure there's I'm sure
that SQL injections which is also a serb

587
00:32:38,710 --> 00:32:41,760
me a horrible water bill is fairness
within his pal

588
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:44,940
its is free to school for zemra arm
you'll be able to

589
00:32:44,940 --> 00:32:48,870
download and how many you can can you
find it's a it's probably probably

590
00:32:48,870 --> 00:32:50,840
several

591
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:54,279
an undisturbed a brief note about crypto
currency

592
00:32:54,279 --> 00:32:57,590
arm in January 2011 the Queen was born

593
00:32:57,590 --> 00:33:03,220
and last year's it's gone from up to as
high as 31 dollars to his lowest in

594
00:33:03,220 --> 00:33:04,809
almost less than a penny

595
00:33:04,809 --> 00:33:09,289
arm and but for the last six months for
whatever reasons for remained stable

596
00:33:09,289 --> 00:33:13,210
force up between four to seven dollars
arm

597
00:33:13,210 --> 00:33:15,700
and addition to pick winners other
crypto currencies that have emerged

598
00:33:15,700 --> 00:33:16,610
compete with that

599
00:33:16,610 --> 00:33:19,740
things like solid point our midst that
solid points

600
00:33:19,740 --> 00:33:23,210
definitely not worth as much tighter
probably worth a few cents a coin but

601
00:33:23,210 --> 00:33:27,679
it's the same principles same a same out
with them same distributed

602
00:33:27,679 --> 00:33:30,929
peer to peer networks ideal and

603
00:33:30,929 --> 00:33:34,169
its it's all the prices are based on
supply and demand

604
00:33:34,169 --> 00:33:37,230
and um when when biklin came out

605
00:33:37,230 --> 00:33:40,429
get all the only had a few docked at
sites where do things like sell drugs

606
00:33:40,429 --> 00:33:43,220
Ursel of Kelowna other illegal
transactions are

607
00:33:43,220 --> 00:33:46,480
very possible with decline because it's
so because it's

608
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:50,409
just like cashiers there's no central
authority people can send

609
00:33:50,409 --> 00:33:54,120
other a physical encrypt the file from
one person to another and

610
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:57,799
the the value of the file is just agreed
upon by the

611
00:33:57,799 --> 00:34:00,860
by the buyers in the marketplace in
general just like me a worthless Federal

612
00:34:00,860 --> 00:34:04,860
Reserve fiat currency or whatever it's
just me its trusted by the users and the

613
00:34:04,860 --> 00:34:05,890
spider-man sets

614
00:34:05,890 --> 00:34:09,220
market arm that's a out

615
00:34:09,220 --> 00:34:13,700
and the you just humor from %uh the
Senate made a big deal about it when it

616
00:34:13,700 --> 00:34:15,379
got some news about you know the

617
00:34:15,379 --> 00:34:18,949
the Silk Road drug market place you
today takes decline but

618
00:34:18,949 --> 00:34:22,279
that its that's really kind of an
anomaly

619
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:26,159
for the most part biklin hasn't really
made the

620
00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:29,520
no been a big player within the
underground economy

621
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:33,070
you'll see it every now and then a few
people will will accept a personal she

622
00:34:33,070 --> 00:34:36,369
just did has a kinda curious in the
concept of crypto currency

623
00:34:36,369 --> 00:34:39,659
but it's it's not arm really an accepted
form

624
00:34:39,659 --> 00:34:42,919
and I'm I believe that to be because the
market fluctuations

625
00:34:42,918 --> 00:34:46,460
on their the motions actors are still
making use of Liberty Reserve

626
00:34:46,460 --> 00:34:49,990
or Yandex money which is another fairly
new one arm

627
00:34:49,990 --> 00:34:54,000
which is matched the which is matched no
wonder want to the US dollar whatever

628
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,109
currency it is in the the country
they're using

629
00:34:56,109 --> 00:35:00,009
a country that there and arm the the
market fluctuations a pic 1

630
00:35:00,010 --> 00:35:05,040
a make it pretty a unattractive for for
long term cyber crime operations

631
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:09,329
because day because the you know they're
they're crazy fluctuation your thirty

632
00:35:09,329 --> 00:35:10,760
one dollars to less than a

633
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:13,859
than less than a penny arm people who
are

634
00:35:13,859 --> 00:35:18,740
engaged in and the the its me or digital
crime for that for a living

635
00:35:18,740 --> 00:35:22,099
arm they can't they don't they don't
want a place that gamble on it yet so

636
00:35:22,099 --> 00:35:25,270
it's a again while there's a few a

637
00:35:25,270 --> 00:35:28,560
most actors add do take that point and
there's even been

638
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:32,349
a botnets based off that point where
Army for per

639
00:35:32,349 --> 00:35:35,720
if you get affected your machine just
starts mining pick one

640
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:39,420
and then we'll send the the coin that
mines to a destination wallet

641
00:35:39,420 --> 00:35:43,430
and those the there are several kids
like that that are circulating and arm

642
00:35:43,430 --> 00:35:47,540
I'm I have no every reversed any them
but these days seem to be fair fairly

643
00:35:47,540 --> 00:35:48,320
interesting

644
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:51,740
arm but aside from those few little
curious anomalies

645
00:35:51,740 --> 00:35:56,329
it hasn't really a gain a foothold as a
currency of choice within the

646
00:35:56,329 --> 00:35:59,510
underground and that's probably a good
thing has begun to be used to do

647
00:35:59,510 --> 00:36:03,210
a whole you a whole bunch a legitimate
cool things seem to buy hosting with a

648
00:36:03,210 --> 00:36:06,579
by your bike re-invite beef jerky with
its its

649
00:36:06,579 --> 00:36:10,310
really cool armies and as long as a

650
00:36:10,310 --> 00:36:14,710
you know this as long as the major media
and government isn't focusing on the

651
00:36:14,710 --> 00:36:18,750
the things that can be done bad %uh the
bad things can be done with it

652
00:36:18,750 --> 00:36:22,079
on there's potential for a lot of good
to be done with it but my

653
00:36:22,079 --> 00:36:25,240
my passion is that decline is seen as a
as a as actual threat

654
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:29,900
to arm to that to the current fascism
that's in place because it's

655
00:36:29,900 --> 00:36:33,119
up decentralized peer-to-peer digital
currency

656
00:36:33,119 --> 00:36:38,660
that is actually worth more than US
dollar right now

657
00:36:38,660 --> 00:36:42,819
so what's to come in the future much
nowhere what's next

658
00:36:42,820 --> 00:36:47,359
a most likely we're gonna II particular
I see an increase in mobile device power

659
00:36:47,359 --> 00:36:50,700
as more and more people start using
their phone so to to do bank

660
00:36:50,700 --> 00:36:53,640
transactions email in just kinda
centralizing

661
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:56,529
all their loggins them to their phone
specials multi-factor authentication

662
00:36:56,530 --> 00:36:58,390
makes use our cell phones

663
00:36:58,390 --> 00:37:02,009
arm mobile device hours going to be a
natural part

664
00:37:02,010 --> 00:37:05,030
of cybercrime talk it's because you're
going to be needed to

665
00:37:05,030 --> 00:37:08,530
you need to infect phones in order to
extract a multi-factor authentication

666
00:37:08,530 --> 00:37:11,829
pressure that you could be needed for a
lot of web applications and thats

667
00:37:11,829 --> 00:37:15,000
that's already starting to to come out
arm

668
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:19,190
as and as html5 becomes more popular
gonna be more client-side attack

669
00:37:19,190 --> 00:37:19,950
specter's

670
00:37:19,950 --> 00:37:22,930
arm is going to be more browser
vulnerabilities that are going to be

671
00:37:22,930 --> 00:37:25,560
leveraged on client site SQL injections

672
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:29,328
going to become more and more common on
both mobile devices and

673
00:37:29,329 --> 00:37:33,740
desktop PCs cuz HR 5 allows the creation
of client-side SQL injection

674
00:37:33,740 --> 00:37:36,970
client-side SQL databases and it's going
to be

675
00:37:36,970 --> 00:37:40,420
new XSS attacks variants that are going
to be there going to be

676
00:37:40,420 --> 00:37:44,160
available arm because html5 is using

677
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:48,078
that because the channel 5 arm a allows
for

678
00:37:48,079 --> 00:37:51,410
new types of commands and functions and

679
00:37:51,410 --> 00:37:56,170
a as far as de dos attacks go arm as
more and more these talk it's are being

680
00:37:56,170 --> 00:37:56,740
released

681
00:37:56,740 --> 00:38:00,329
as it becomes easier and easier to
launch significant attacks

682
00:38:00,329 --> 00:38:04,070
using using large mass bandwidth arm

683
00:38:04,070 --> 00:38:07,540
it's going to that's going to be
continues to grow and

684
00:38:07,540 --> 00:38:11,029
some then become a become an issue

685
00:38:11,030 --> 00:38:14,890
and and again sure some

686
00:38:14,890 --> 00:38:19,779
some resources for forearm anyone who
would like more information I in the

687
00:38:19,780 --> 00:38:21,540
stuff that was discussed today

688
00:38:21,540 --> 00:38:25,960
arm the all the the de dos tools that
were discussed

689
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:29,660
are available from the threat advisory
section that relaxing dot com

690
00:38:29,660 --> 00:38:33,649
up it's free for the public just up and
go and and download it

691
00:38:33,650 --> 00:38:37,990
arm a the collective intelligence
framework is a really really need

692
00:38:37,990 --> 00:38:41,390
a project that's there recently been
developed where it'll take

693
00:38:41,390 --> 00:38:45,009
a the feeds from all the different in
our tracking I'll

694
00:38:45,010 --> 00:38:48,040
on our checking sites like as use
tracker

695
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:52,390
clean air max spy eye tracker if you can
name it it's already on the list

696
00:38:52,390 --> 00:38:55,700
and then it centralizes at all so that
you're not having the

697
00:38:55,700 --> 00:38:58,820
you basically bass are all these
different resources to it so

698
00:38:58,820 --> 00:39:03,119
poll on credit research centers it's
just collective intelligence framework

699
00:39:03,119 --> 00:39:04,430
with a centralized at all

700
00:39:04,430 --> 00:39:07,669
and Paul's sources the statistics and
data through it

701
00:39:07,670 --> 00:39:12,060
arm also a regarding where the political
advisors in the dirt jumper their

702
00:39:12,060 --> 00:39:12,980
advisory

703
00:39:12,980 --> 00:39:16,520
we have a tool that we were any Scott
dirt dozer dot

704
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:20,210
P why and you can't read a list of
command and control servers

705
00:39:20,210 --> 00:39:23,820
to to the Python script it will
fingerprint them if they're

706
00:39:23,820 --> 00:39:27,890
if the dirt jumper tell you the type of
attack and the target of the attack

707
00:39:27,890 --> 00:39:30,950
so if you have a list of products or
services you can identify who's being

708
00:39:30,950 --> 00:39:31,670
hit

709
00:39:31,670 --> 00:39:34,710
I'll with doctor trefor and house

710
00:39:34,710 --> 00:39:37,960
Adam some good open source intelligence
resources just to

711
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:42,390
get for good feeling as what's what's
going on in the underground open SC .ws

712
00:39:42,390 --> 00:39:46,400
is a is a malware forum our mix up and
down all the time

713
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:49,829
because it's up it's in our form and

714
00:39:49,829 --> 00:39:53,710
they've but they a lot a good leaks and
up gotta lotta good leaks end up showing

715
00:39:53,710 --> 00:39:56,500
up there before a show up anywhere else

716
00:39:56,500 --> 00:40:01,420
Krebs on security dot com as a Brian
Krebs investigative journalist Davies

717

eyes putting our real that information
about on

718

two-faced web sites arm is all these
different facing cruiser just

724
00:40:24,650 --> 00:40:28,730
a time that though hit like a book list
of domains to face him although I'll try

to get your rep points by posting up on
his own age .org

everything else just search for the

other crime markets down stairs for
anyone Australia vulnerabilities

732
00:40:53,130 --> 00:40:57,630
and arm everette that's at the pac-man
meet able to see a pic percent 27 on the

733
00:40:57,630 --> 00:40:59,130
table in the mezzanine level

734
00:40:59,130 --> 00:41:06,130
and if there's any questions I'll take
questions

735
00:41:12,359 --> 00:41:14,060
are thanks very much

736
00:41:14,060 --> 00:41:21,060
always crash in the back

737
00:41:38,769 --> 00:41:45,769
for II den here for question was the
overall situation where

738
00:41:50,510 --> 00:41:52,160
%uh through using delivering

739
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:59,160
on our through peer to peer networks

740
00:42:16,120 --> 00:42:17,440
yet

741
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:20,200
are yeah I I was able to to dove

742
00:42:20,200 --> 00:42:24,460
only about here everything is it serves
pretty darn I D but on their their

743
00:42:24,460 --> 00:42:27,839
all sorts of our vectors exploitation
which are being leverage for these

744
00:42:27,839 --> 00:42:31,930
these types of talk it's arm pretty much
if if you can envision it

745
00:42:31,930 --> 00:42:38,930
its it's being done

746
00:42:40,890 --> 00:42:47,890
yep

747
00:42:48,349 --> 00:42:55,349
rate

748
00:43:05,540 --> 00:43:09,120
well the bootloaders are usually amid
their

749
00:43:09,120 --> 00:43:12,290
the Justice a single executable
application that

750
00:43:12,290 --> 00:43:16,200
yeah exactly there's like this in some
the real fancy ones that like a

751
00:43:16,200 --> 00:43:19,470
php/mysql thing in the cell service is
so that people can

752
00:43:19,470 --> 00:43:22,590
pay a fee to log into the boot loader
and then run their own lists

753
00:43:22,590 --> 00:43:27,610
but for arm for the most part the the
attackers needs tardy have the list

754
00:43:27,610 --> 00:43:32,080
yeah I just yeah I just need to know the
URL where the boilers at me you can send

755
00:43:32,080 --> 00:43:32,330
it

756
00:43:32,300 --> 00:43:39,300
a target time limits start hitting it

757
00:43:48,210 --> 00:43:51,190
arm with they're they're still on at a

758
00:43:51,190 --> 00:43:55,420
expose being delivered through through
advertisements like flash one abilities

759
00:43:55,420 --> 00:43:58,549
arm is just not as prevalent in the
market Adobe's done a pretty good job

760
00:43:58,549 --> 00:43:59,680
over the last two years I've

761
00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:02,899
fixing that but there are still 0 days
get discovered in

762
00:44:02,900 --> 00:44:08,299
and trash in that a are infections
throughout the dirty advertising still

763
00:44:08,299 --> 00:44:09,329
very common thing

764
00:44:09,329 --> 00:44:12,569
and on and of us regarding if you're
talking about

765
00:44:12,569 --> 00:44:16,740
adware like the advertisers that
infected machine and XI giving the pop

766
00:44:16,740 --> 00:44:17,430
ups and stuff

767
00:44:17,430 --> 00:44:21,618
on those those are usually our existing
and the use that to push out

768
00:44:21,619 --> 00:44:28,619
the executable

769
00:44:38,290 --> 00:44:41,120
arm

770
00:44:41,120 --> 00:44:43,290
will all n/an/a

771
00:44:43,290 --> 00:44:46,870
in a target or there's will basically
expert his work is that no fingerprint

772
00:44:46,870 --> 00:44:47,970
the attack though the hit

773
00:44:47,970 --> 00:44:51,590
everything and I just see what's on
herbal and Java is usually the last

774
00:44:51,590 --> 00:44:52,830
resort because

775
00:44:52,830 --> 00:44:56,590
most people run Java so little try to do
a browser exploit that doesn't work I'll

776
00:44:56,590 --> 00:44:58,390
try to a flashlight that doesn't like
that

777
00:44:58,390 --> 00:45:01,710
they know that they're all trying to
load up to a job applicant and I'll

778
00:45:01,710 --> 00:45:05,700
man honest example the target attack is
up while the Brian Krebs blog

779
00:45:05,700 --> 00:45:08,840
argued here a me he would go on to
certain

780
00:45:08,840 --> 00:45:12,370
underground forms and once they
discovered that it was investigative

781
00:45:12,370 --> 00:45:13,009
journalist

782
00:45:13,010 --> 00:45:16,450
they decided to buy ad space on his
website that was

783
00:45:16,450 --> 00:45:21,220
a maliciously coated and a he had to
approve it so we caught it but it had

784
00:45:21,220 --> 00:45:22,650
gone all the way through he woulda

785
00:45:22,650 --> 00:45:29,650
regular starter checking people yeah it
gets very possible to

786
00:45:33,230 --> 00:45:37,130
to embed the eye frames and dirty
JavaScript into its advertisers are

787
00:45:37,130 --> 00:45:40,600
purchased and that's still very common
infection method for drive-by downloads

788
00:45:40,600 --> 00:45:44,180
a

789
00:45:44,180 --> 00:45:51,180
you

790
00:46:15,330 --> 00:46:19,869
get that that does exist on there has
been on JavaScript versions are

791
00:46:19,869 --> 00:46:22,940
above the low orbit ion cannon other
sanity to stores where

792
00:46:22,940 --> 00:46:27,240
of people can just start stick and
iframes on on infected site sir

793
00:46:27,240 --> 00:46:30,369
and basically just by hitting their
website the JavaScript to start making

794
00:46:30,369 --> 00:46:33,450
the visitors started it gary queso
basically able to distribute all those

795
00:46:33,450 --> 00:46:35,380
attacks against legitimate YouTube a
so-so

796
00:46:35,380 --> 00:46:38,590
as long as the web sites open attacks
are being run so that that's

797
00:46:38,590 --> 00:46:42,520
but definite system that's another arm
that's another step excellent where

798
00:46:42,520 --> 00:46:44,470
things are paid only going more into the
future

799
00:46:44,470 --> 00:46:49,450
maybe Diaz without infection air
questions

800
00:46:49,450 --> 00:46:56,450
up

801
00:47:07,940 --> 00:47:11,190
are I i'm believe a it is in the
Guinness Mike

802
00:47:11,190 --> 00:47:14,410
hypothesis I i don't have any prove this
but I believe

803
00:47:14,410 --> 00:47:19,520
a lot of the the mobile applications and
animations as the existing primerica's

804
00:47:19,520 --> 00:47:20,200
acknowledges

805
00:47:20,200 --> 00:47:24,590
I believe it is probably developed by
third parties or obtaining this

806
00:47:24,590 --> 00:47:27,750
the leaked code and is making changes to
it but I'm

807
00:47:27,750 --> 00:47:31,590
tree shared the the you know somebody
region of others might still be involved

808
00:47:31,590 --> 00:47:34,580
that but there's also been your rumor
and chatter within the underground at

809
00:47:34,580 --> 00:47:35,279
the authors have

810
00:47:35,280 --> 00:47:39,910
retired and that type of stuff so the
really who knows is all but two handles

811
00:47:39,910 --> 00:47:41,649
and all and this could be the same
person

812
00:47:41,650 --> 00:47:45,680
how a any more questions

813
00:47:45,680 --> 00:47:48,740
