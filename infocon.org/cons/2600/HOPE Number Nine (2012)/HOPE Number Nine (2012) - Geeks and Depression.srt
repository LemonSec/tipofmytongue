1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:02,750
and would be happy to talk more about
that kinda privately with people if

2
00:00:02,750 --> 00:00:03,889
you're interested in cell

3
00:00:03,889 --> 00:00:07,839
an darman would you like to give us a
little

4
00:00:07,839 --> 00:00:11,820
that or would you like to master the
first %uh

5
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:16,630
antecedents but

6
00:00:16,630 --> 00:00:20,689
on so I got into the hacker community

7
00:00:20,689 --> 00:00:24,359
when I was a ballot 1718

8
00:00:24,359 --> 00:00:28,580
and I had to come from a very abusive
childhood

9
00:00:28,580 --> 00:00:34,980
and I was also very isolated as well as
up from school kid

10
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:39,440
and I had never been to public school on
a huge going to college is a way to you

11
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:43,670
risky from the situation I was yeah I
was actually

12
00:00:43,670 --> 00:00:47,160
also create a woefully underprepared for

13
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:50,350
like just belief in people in general

14
00:00:50,350 --> 00:00:54,879
by it anything is better than what I
have been exchanging previously

15
00:00:54,879 --> 00:00:58,640
and I in college I met some people who
were

16
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:03,160
heard 2600 and they got introduced to
other people on 2600 mister

17
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:07,000
nine meetings they start learning things
from these people

18
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,220
and through my interaction with actor
Sheen

19
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:15,100
2200 I gained skills

20
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:19,540
and the ability to support myself and
keep going into

21
00:01:19,540 --> 00:01:24,979
stay out a lot like rockman places that
they otherwise could have been

22
00:01:24,979 --> 00:01:30,189
prevented myself from going back ever
having a reason to go back

23
00:01:30,189 --> 00:01:35,729
on at the same time a lot of the people
that I encountered

24
00:01:35,729 --> 00:01:39,689
within the hacker sheen within 20 to 200
were also whole

25
00:01:39,689 --> 00:01:42,960
similarly arm

26
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:46,770
traumatized or disordered or had some
kinda

27
00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:50,610
arm like emotional problems on the
people that I met

28
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:54,979
we are very helpful in love the people I
met were also very abusive to me

29
00:01:54,979 --> 00:01:58,640
and the there's no

30
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:03,329
talking about their there's no outlet
for their child knowledge man

31
00:02:03,329 --> 00:02:09,819
I'll the damage there we can do to each
other within the hacker community once

32
00:02:09,819 --> 00:02:12,209
we get involved as friends or

33
00:02:12,209 --> 00:02:15,950
wakin injured a very close interpersonal
om

34
00:02:15,950 --> 00:02:21,810
interaction and it was due to weird
balance firm in arms we balance for me

35
00:02:21,810 --> 00:02:22,560
it was like a

36
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:27,720
on one hand like I was given a lot of
opportunities to better myself and to

37
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:28,300
keep

38
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:31,680
myself going at the same time they
resided

39
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:34,840
she things still happening me on

40
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:39,319
and I did eventually yet more and more
isolated Khazei

41
00:02:39,319 --> 00:02:43,890
couldn't deal with the ER like the
continued he Xing

42
00:02:43,890 --> 00:02:48,099
tends to go on within these communities
within these communities among certain

43
00:02:48,099 --> 00:02:48,829
people

44
00:02:48,830 --> 00:02:52,560
and eventually I came to with you
completely

45
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:56,489
and a saloon here in New York and
eventually moved on

46
00:02:56,489 --> 00:02:59,950
to Chicago where and I was like

47
00:02:59,950 --> 00:03:03,780
three years ago is right 25 and there I
decided

48
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:09,130
that it was time to either as a as I put
it in my head

49
00:03:09,130 --> 00:03:12,299
either man up in kill myself or mana and

50
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:17,170
actually try and fix holes going wrong
internally because

51
00:03:17,170 --> 00:03:22,690
like no amount of moving could work on
things that were going

52
00:03:22,690 --> 00:03:27,780
on inside my head like a was in a lot of
pain I believe that it was my home in a

53
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:30,989
deserve it or had brought it on myself
or something like that

54
00:03:30,989 --> 00:03:35,989
and the only choice that I kept ending
up seen much just two

55
00:03:35,989 --> 00:03:41,150
remove myself from world but that easy

56
00:03:41,150 --> 00:03:45,810
very permanent solution to what might be
a temporary problem and I thought about

57
00:03:45,810 --> 00:03:46,670
it from

58
00:03:46,670 --> 00:03:50,310
the perspective like okay deal I

59
00:03:50,310 --> 00:03:53,670
AM I ready for this the answer was
actually know there's a lot of caution

60
00:03:53,670 --> 00:03:55,700
the world's let me try this other thing

61
00:03:55,700 --> 00:04:01,000
an icon suicide hotline I got myself
into their pianos in a city where ahead

62
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,079
no friends now is an abusive
relationship

63
00:04:04,079 --> 00:04:10,600
and I A left chicago won a move to San
Francisco and

64
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:14,549
I kept working on things and working on
my cell

65
00:04:14,549 --> 00:04:19,140
and you didn't go very well first to be
honest like I still felt shitty lot of

66
00:04:19,140 --> 00:04:20,269
the time is still

67
00:04:20,269 --> 00:04:24,610
didn't like myself most of the time and

68
00:04:24,610 --> 00:04:27,870
it took a long time ago

69
00:04:27,870 --> 00:04:32,610
repeated thrown myself against the wall
trying different things trying

70
00:04:32,610 --> 00:04:38,720
om various medications i'm i'm on
adderall I've never been on SSRI's I did

71
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:39,680
that on purpose

72
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:44,960
arm to try im work more on my emotional
state

73
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:49,919
them my com then just like peace silver
with chemicals

74
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:54,250
om and I kept trying I

75
00:04:54,250 --> 00:05:00,050
stopped interacting with people who were
damaging me I A

76
00:05:00,050 --> 00:05:04,050
started reevaluating like the choices
that I was making most importantly why I

77
00:05:04,050 --> 00:05:07,150
was making a lot of them came from a
place lol

78
00:05:07,150 --> 00:05:10,780
I didn't feel that I deserved any better
or I felt bad

79
00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:14,030
these fact that people that I was
interacting with were the only ones who

80
00:05:14,030 --> 00:05:15,550
can understand me

81
00:05:15,550 --> 00:05:19,840
om and so I just kinda Blake

82
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:24,070
looked at those eight years in kind of
let them go inserted trying to

83
00:05:24,070 --> 00:05:27,169
deliberately make choices even though
they didn't feel

84
00:05:27,169 --> 00:05:30,799
rate at the time where they didn't feel

85
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:34,039
natural I just started making different
choices nick gets better

86
00:05:34,039 --> 00:05:39,479
on if you try and sometimes it doesn't
get better right away

87
00:05:39,479 --> 00:05:42,919
and it didn't get better right away from
you man it's getting better slowly

88
00:05:42,919 --> 00:05:48,210
and sometimes I still think like okay
maybe

89
00:05:48,210 --> 00:05:52,190
not killing myself wasn't the right
choice say I still feel like I don't

90
00:05:52,190 --> 00:05:53,180
have enough data

91
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:56,210
to draw a conclusion either way some
unique keep trying

92
00:05:56,210 --> 00:06:02,570
and in the meantime I've Blake I found a
lot of good friends on a value in hacker

93
00:06:02,570 --> 00:06:04,090
seen and I've taken particle

94

so entire

106
00:06:56,420 --> 00:06:59,710
been dealing with depression since I was
a teenager um

107
00:06:59,710 --> 00:07:03,270
headin to reserve kinda like unfortunate
events

108
00:07:03,270 --> 00:07:07,289
arm happen and a very very nasty divorce
at my parents kinda

109
00:07:07,290 --> 00:07:12,260
set me off I went from like being a you
know happy kid making straight A's to

110
00:07:12,260 --> 00:07:12,560
you

111
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:16,630
purposely making the lowest possible
grades that I could install past just to

112
00:07:16,630 --> 00:07:17,620
piss everyone off

113
00:07:17,620 --> 00:07:20,730
um a

114
00:07:20,730 --> 00:07:24,540
really pissed everyone are cell I N

115
00:07:24,540 --> 00:07:28,140
and this is the really really angry
teenager

116
00:07:28,140 --> 00:07:31,530
and then virtually had some medical
problems on top of that my lung

117
00:07:31,530 --> 00:07:34,620
collapsed and it's been a couple months
the hospital between a few things had

118
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:35,620
some surgery

119
00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:39,850
and I as I got burned heads musical
therapy from and Justin

120
00:07:39,850 --> 00:07:45,120
mention other things and so on around
until I was 16 and I was extremely

121
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:48,090
extremely unhappy in thailand is one
morning I woke up

122
00:07:48,090 --> 00:07:51,420
and it on my speed and add-on

123
00:07:51,420 --> 00:07:55,190
a describe it to number about the people
have had similar experiences were you

124
00:07:55,190 --> 00:07:57,370
get completely apathetic dislike

125
00:07:57,370 --> 00:08:01,280
no emotions whatsoever and everything is
almost like pure logic

126
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:04,500
and they came to the logical conclusion
that I should just kill myself because

127
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:05,560
that was a

128
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:08,640
the correct answer cuz other ways

129
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:11,900
when I was out there that I was going to
be experiencing pain again I couldn't in

130
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:12,660
that pain

131
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:17,180
arm and they got to the point of having
the gun in my mouth being ready to pull

132
00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:18,850
the trigger and then her mom come home

133
00:08:18,850 --> 00:08:23,390
and it has had this profound realization
at that moment and how much that would

134
00:08:23,390 --> 00:08:24,820
affect not just

135
00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:27,849
mean being a permanent solution

136
00:08:27,850 --> 00:08:31,870
on impotency one-time

137
00:08:31,870 --> 00:08:36,270
thing so be done with that and so the
mime mother came home and i realize our

138
00:08:36,270 --> 00:08:39,960
my mom being an issue try to resuscitate
me and if I hadn't done this correctly

139
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:43,610
and I died then she probably does pick
up a gun and kill herself the my sister

140
00:08:43,610 --> 00:08:45,150
would come home then she fine

141
00:08:45,150 --> 00:08:50,120
both his dad min and it's got her for
life man only in my step dad and thus

142
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:53,030
all the stuff Lake City cascading the
circuit thinking about friends and

143
00:08:53,030 --> 00:08:54,010
family noticed

144
00:08:54,010 --> 00:08:58,410
this moment sitting on the floor
realizing just how much I effected

145
00:08:58,410 --> 00:09:00,430
everybody and how much that was gonna
change everything

146
00:09:00,430 --> 00:09:04,780
answer from that point on I've actually
never gotten back to the suicidal point

147
00:09:04,780 --> 00:09:07,089
on whenever I get to that logical

148
00:09:07,090 --> 00:09:12,840
emotionless stay on my a solution as
always go to a crisis center or call

149
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:13,700
somebody

150
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:18,130
instead of continuing on a been there a
couple of other times it only seems to

151
00:09:18,130 --> 00:09:21,830
build up over time and eventually get
there arm

152
00:09:21,830 --> 00:09:25,810
p.m. I'm very open with talking to
people about this

153
00:09:25,810 --> 00:09:29,970
arm it had unfortunately couple friends
and even on close family members

154
00:09:29,970 --> 00:09:34,830
both attend and successfully call
themselves as well

155
00:09:34,830 --> 00:09:38,250
and it's a really um

156
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:41,570
Miami knits its it's difficult

157
00:09:41,570 --> 00:09:46,330
to deal with so I am seriously willing
to talk to anybody at any time

158
00:09:46,330 --> 00:09:50,060
mom about the senses types of things on

159
00:09:50,060 --> 00:09:54,950
so they respond to my life I've been on
and off medications

160
00:09:54,950 --> 00:09:58,710
I highly recommend going on medications
and seeing a good therapist when you get

161
00:09:58,710 --> 00:10:02,910
to the states the medications are going
to fix everything but they do help you

162
00:10:02,910 --> 00:10:06,130
deal with some of the problems that
takes the edge off

163
00:10:06,130 --> 00:10:10,180
sometimes arm because they get these
crazy anxieties over just

164
00:10:10,180 --> 00:10:13,910
silly stuff you know it's like you a
gets a depressingly make a killing by

165
00:10:13,910 --> 00:10:17,219
their league opening my email to sleep
evenly looking at the email or

166
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:20,890
you know is like doing laundry its is
some leak arbitrary things they need to

167
00:10:20,890 --> 00:10:22,189
do this one thing

168
00:10:22,190 --> 00:10:25,830
where the dishes are piled up or I need
to go in like buy bread

169
00:10:25,830 --> 00:10:30,050
for years is likely these tiny things
but they're so huge do you think these

170
00:10:30,050 --> 00:10:31,220
huge walls in

171
00:10:31,220 --> 00:10:35,070
this very difficult to get past and
sometimes medication can help therapy

172
00:10:35,070 --> 00:10:36,090
appts Louis helps

173
00:10:36,090 --> 00:10:39,980
I'm having people to talk to you helps I
found for myself living with other

174
00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:41,310
people is pretty important

175
00:10:41,310 --> 00:10:45,460
and i cant live by myself it's just that
that doesn't work out and up kinda by a

176
00:10:45,460 --> 00:10:49,060
living in pig sty and its not good
because I have OCD

177
00:10:49,060 --> 00:10:52,760
about things being clean and so they
have this huge anxiety about things not

178
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:53,569
being clean

179
00:10:53,570 --> 00:10:57,610
and then I just can't do anything I can
deal with it and done

180
00:10:57,610 --> 00:11:02,210
and wanna go outside and I don't wanna
be in the apartment and so

181
00:11:02,210 --> 00:11:06,710
yeah it's just it's it's a terrible
state to be in and the experience the

182
00:11:06,710 --> 00:11:07,970
sexually arm

183
00:11:07,970 --> 00:11:13,570
a pretty much acaban our on and it
happened a little bit before congress

184
00:11:13,570 --> 00:11:17,580
and for around eight months I just
pretty much dropped off the internet

185
00:11:17,580 --> 00:11:20,900
stopped posting to Twitter in which is a
pretty good indicator that I am

186
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:24,430
not longer talking anyway I'm not on
Twitter

187

and arm so does congress may I usually
get a crash after

191
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:43,689

a pretty norm for a lot of people it's

192
00:11:43,690 --> 00:11:46,920
really intense love bunch of amazing
moments and then

226

well

228
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:54,710
down mom I love the first half my life
in

229
00:13:54,710 --> 00:13:57,970
total depression I'm

230
00:13:57,970 --> 00:14:01,660
my parents did what they were supposed
to do which was

231
00:14:01,660 --> 00:14:05,079
get married have kids they didn't even
like kids

232
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:08,790
arm they weren't you home you're
actually turn out to be really cool

233
00:14:08,790 --> 00:14:11,240
people which will be later on we compute

234
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:16,620
become friends as adults but as a kid
that doesn't do me any good

235
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:19,920
does merely the brutally

236
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:23,200
bullied hmm daily I was

237
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:27,390
physically abused by these bullies
almost-daily

238
00:14:27,390 --> 00:14:32,400
teachers in school that I went to to
stood by and watched

239
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:36,270
as the police believe me im often even
as they beat me

240
00:14:36,270 --> 00:14:42,650
especially the gym teacher even if you
had to choose

241
00:14:42,650 --> 00:14:47,130
cell from my parents didn't know what to
do i mean they're totally depressed and

242
00:14:47,130 --> 00:14:47,839
the fight

243
00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:51,380
when I told them about what's going on
in order to how to deal with leaders

244
00:14:51,380 --> 00:14:53,020
want the pain to go away

245
00:14:53,020 --> 00:14:57,860
and it wasn't going away so they told me
the logical thing to do which is it's

246
00:14:57,860 --> 00:14:59,320
not their problem just

247
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:03,530
are not your problem with their problems
and secure something with them

248
00:15:03,530 --> 00:15:07,100
what does that mean you will fire a
6-year-old

249
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:11,260
so I did the best I could to more than
farming instructions as though is

250
00:15:11,260 --> 00:15:13,490
trained to do by my parents

251
00:15:13,490 --> 00:15:16,610
and I would just sit there and they
would beat me and I would try to ignore

252
00:15:16,610 --> 00:15:17,860
them

253
00:15:17,860 --> 00:15:21,850
be more retarded I retreated into you

254
00:15:21,850 --> 00:15:26,190
television my first hard-core addiction
when I got home which made everything

255
00:15:26,190 --> 00:15:28,270
better

256
00:15:28,270 --> 00:15:34,010
until the end of the half hour but then
there was another show

257
00:15:34,010 --> 00:15:36,880
I don't like that show either but I kept
watching it cuz I didn't know what else

258
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:38,660
to do and I'm

259
00:15:38,660 --> 00:15:40,050
am and now

260
00:15:40,050 --> 00:15:46,010
I didn't learn any social skills I yeah
became more unhealthy more overweight

261
00:15:46,010 --> 00:15:51,010
arm and I didn't get any better at
sports which I hate it anyways

262
00:15:51,010 --> 00:15:55,300
it made me more retarded when he went
back to school only to retreat back into

263
00:15:55,300 --> 00:15:57,329
television against Ole Miss is

264
00:15:57,329 --> 00:16:00,700
no addiction works and I'm I became
really good addiction

265
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:04,690
which didn't help me your profession hmm

266
00:16:04,690 --> 00:16:08,440
and hmm the other one on for

267
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:12,000
mmm on first half my life

268
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:16,459
really and it wasn't until I was

269
00:16:16,459 --> 00:16:19,630
mambo 25 per so arm

270
00:16:19,630 --> 00:16:23,149
when I was watching Gilligan's Island

271
00:16:23,149 --> 00:16:26,329
I he did Julian's island

272
00:16:26,329 --> 00:16:30,079
I watched gilligan's island everyday

273
00:16:30,079 --> 00:16:35,140
I hated every day but it always had at
least one line that kept me coming back

274
00:16:35,140 --> 00:16:36,089
for more

275
00:16:36,089 --> 00:16:40,660
and I am but I realize that one day in
with about 25

276
00:16:40,660 --> 00:16:44,730
that I've been doing this for 25 years
and I've been hitting it for two years

277
00:16:44,730 --> 00:16:46,510
and didn't have to keep doing it

278
00:16:46,510 --> 00:16:50,700
and I got rhythm I all 50 of my
televisions

279
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:54,709
I'ma geek I would collect them fix them

280
00:16:54,709 --> 00:16:58,720
given away on but I kept a bunch and I'm

281
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:02,470
among the street and it was the first
time in my entire life and I'm a

282
00:17:02,470 --> 00:17:06,169
decision from me you rather than the big
decision based on what I've believed

283
00:17:06,169 --> 00:17:08,079
other people wanted of me

284
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:12,530
after all I hated myself I was telling
the press seems to work well as a whole

285
00:17:12,530 --> 00:17:13,000
is

286
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:17,199
in worthless piece of shit why would I
make decisions based on what I want

287
00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:21,140
what I want doesn't even matter to other
people want but I was the first time in

288
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:22,329
a decision from

289
00:17:22,329 --> 00:17:25,339
me and I'm

290
00:17:25,339 --> 00:17:28,389
it felt great min

291
00:17:28,390 --> 00:17:31,919
instantly I realized I had

292
00:17:31,919 --> 00:17:35,870
me more time than I knew what to do with
hmm

293
00:17:35,870 --> 00:17:39,070
it was terrible

294
00:17:39,070 --> 00:17:43,490
I everything I've been pushing way for
all those years came screaming back and

295
00:17:43,490 --> 00:17:44,929
it would not shut up

296
00:17:44,929 --> 00:17:48,330
and they didn't have anything to blotted
out with like television

297
00:17:48,330 --> 00:17:51,550
million want to do that again

298
00:17:51,550 --> 00:17:55,030
exploring other means im addiction

299
00:17:55,030 --> 00:17:58,080
hand on plot was my first time

300
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:01,879
it was great I could be my high school
just to be cool I do smoke pot and

301
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:03,130
people would talk to you

302
00:18:03,130 --> 00:18:06,480
you could be silly you could do fun
things you could be on the way the

303
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:09,240
smoking and being silly instead of going
to math class

304
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:14,650
and of course intelligently take it easy
ways so there's no consequence is right

305
00:18:14,650 --> 00:18:18,179
so arm %um

306
00:18:18,179 --> 00:18:22,490
and because it helped me so much dealing
with other people

307
00:18:22,490 --> 00:18:25,510
wanted me to be run to be silly with
rather than PBR

308
00:18:25,510 --> 00:18:31,860
I wanted more and boy did i do more you
got in the way and I get paranoid when I

309
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:34,059
get down on myself and I'm

310
00:18:34,059 --> 00:18:37,250
started meditating meditations way to
fix myself and I

311
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:40,800
who didn't realize back then that I
can't fix myself I could only make

312
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:42,379
myself crazy

313
00:18:42,380 --> 00:18:46,850
and I'm so I can focus on other things
that are wrong with me and

314
00:18:46,850 --> 00:18:50,300
change my old behavior surrounding it
and I became

315
00:18:50,300 --> 00:18:54,139
perfect person for the with according to
my days

316
00:18:54,140 --> 00:18:58,530
you know 16-year-old brain I love what
other people wanted me to be

317
00:18:58,530 --> 00:19:03,440
and that became really interesting new
song from one group while his likeness

318
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:07,540
and someone from the other group was
like that and the same room

319
00:19:07,540 --> 00:19:10,770
Who Am I D I'll

320
00:19:10,770 --> 00:19:14,240
high on pot unable to think in leading
people to get down on myself

321
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:18,780
yeah so of a bunch of an experience like
that are a few years now realize maybe I

322
00:19:18,780 --> 00:19:19,940
should just be me

323
00:19:19,940 --> 00:19:23,750
Armenia more choices screen pops
suddenly I

324
00:19:23,750 --> 00:19:27,400
everything I was pulling apart from
screaming back and I found other drugs

325
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:29,520
so anyways going for a few those

326
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:32,650
I'm but still a long way meditating

327
00:19:32,650 --> 00:19:36,240
actually see more who I am becoming more
unified whole

328
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:41,100
making choices dealing with the
consequences choices for me

329
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:45,150
rather than when I believe other people
wanted love me I

330
00:19:45,150 --> 00:19:48,679
and years and years and years of doing
bad little bit

331
00:19:48,679 --> 00:19:52,510
%uh success a lot of failure

332
00:19:52,510 --> 00:19:56,120
at learning from the consequences my
choices %uh

333
00:19:56,120 --> 00:20:01,190
doing things in my life that I actually
didn't heed are choosing to make time to

334
00:20:01,190 --> 00:20:02,770
do things that I might like

335
00:20:02,770 --> 00:20:07,870
making time I do mean less things I like
so I can export I love

336
00:20:07,870 --> 00:20:12,230
are making more movies choices and
learning from the consequences

337
00:20:12,230 --> 00:20:15,870
which I had no control over in learning
and make new choices years and years

338
00:20:15,870 --> 00:20:18,950
it's takes time for this shit and the
hardest thing

339
00:20:18,950 --> 00:20:22,390
is to be patient and boy him

340
00:20:22,390 --> 00:20:26,070
without hard for me to learn but
eventually I was

341
00:20:26,070 --> 00:20:29,879
some next be traveling to Alaska I drove
there

342
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:33,880
and I he saw

343
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:36,990
a metaphor for life and traveling

344
00:20:36,990 --> 00:20:40,540
there was really only one road with very
few choices

345
00:20:40,540 --> 00:20:45,480
but every one time there was an
intersection I could turn left

346
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:49,050
I could turn right could stay there I
could go back

347
00:20:49,050 --> 00:20:52,700
I could move to Alaska um my gonna doom

348
00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:57,970
I just decided I would do whatever felt
best in that moment

349
00:20:57,970 --> 00:21:01,880
and I'm that's what I did and it let me
do incredible

350
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:06,140
self experiences over several months
traveling around Alaska

351
00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:10,440
until I V got a job my first consulting
job

352
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:13,630
ripping we got other fish in fishkin

353
00:21:13,630 --> 00:21:17,380
it was the stupidest thing I've ever
done job wise number and some stupid

354
00:21:17,380 --> 00:21:18,669
things job wise

355
00:21:18,669 --> 00:21:23,010
arm yeah covered knee-deep in fish heads
and slime and I'll

356
00:21:23,010 --> 00:21:26,200
and I kept on my cell phone gets bad
enough I'll just quit

357
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:30,200
and that became a mantra and eventually
realize it and saying that mantra as it

358
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:32,570
got WAY worse than possible

359
00:21:32,570 --> 00:21:36,620
and I A realize my really can quit and I
quit on the spot

360
00:21:36,620 --> 00:21:40,070
and with nynex me said we love you quit

361
00:21:40,070 --> 00:21:45,050
in Galway who's gonna keep us all happy

362
00:21:45,050 --> 00:21:48,590
need most depressed person on the planet
keep you happy

363
00:21:48,590 --> 00:21:52,470
what are you talking about but I realize
rivers highlight actually had been happy

364
00:21:52,470 --> 00:21:54,659
for an extended period

365
00:21:54,659 --> 00:21:58,100
it was miraculous and um

366
00:21:58,100 --> 00:22:03,200
now bizarre %uh the first I realize that
it was really possible

367
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:07,919
and was all because a making a conscious
process happened making choices learning

368
00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:08,770
from

369
00:22:08,770 --> 00:22:13,100
having no control a consequence the
billowing from making new choices

370
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:17,120
based on what i think is the coolest
often I'm wrong

371
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:21,530
I but you know we live and learn and

372
00:22:21,530 --> 00:22:24,990
all these years later im 55 now

373
00:22:24,990 --> 00:22:28,370
time does keeping and from

374
00:22:28,370 --> 00:22:33,919
I E have not been identified as a
depressed person in so long

375
00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:37,899
um I still get depressed its to he still

376
00:22:37,899 --> 00:22:43,330

377
00:22:43,330 --> 00:22:47,550

00:22:47,550 --> 00:22:51,470
and I do live a life I love you with
things that happen holy fucking sock

379
00:22:51,470 --> 00:22:54,159

380
00:22:54,159 --> 00:22:57,559
arm %uh but im I'm really really

381
00:22:57,559 --> 00:23:01,168
happy and grateful to be experiencing
everything I experience

382
00:23:01,169 --> 00:23:04,290
which is so different than what I
experience

383
00:23:04,290 --> 00:23:08,940
all live my life my the exclusion of all
else when I was a kid

384
00:23:08,940 --> 00:23:13,110
so we had really many as possible to go
through this and I love helping other

385
00:23:13,110 --> 00:23:15,000
people anyway that I can come

386

now that I'm old enough to keep track of
my boundaries take care myself in the

387
00:23:18,419 --> 00:23:19,800
process

388
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:23,340
arm which is why do everything that I DM

and do things that I love mmm

393
00:23:38,300 --> 00:23:45,300

394
00:23:50,650 --> 00:23:52,060
some early telling

395
00:23:52,060 --> 00:23:55,510
a my story but rather lens story

396
00:23:55,510 --> 00:23:58,770
which is an in large part a story about
the

397
00:23:58,770 --> 00:24:01,790
the stigma that's attached to

398
00:24:01,790 --> 00:24:06,060
chronic depression and you noted to an
extent mental illness and not at mental

399
00:24:06,060 --> 00:24:07,190

profound

elves and sufficiently incompetent as to
be evil professionals

417

00:25:36,580 --> 00:25:40,270
a into a certain amount of an

425

460
00:27:46,190 --> 00:27:49,850
that was basically the point where
everything started tumbling down hell

461
00:27:49,850 --> 00:27:54,650
om although it did to it although it did
later turn out that the presence and was

462
00:27:54,650 --> 00:27:56,370
implicated somehow in

463
00:27:56,370 --> 00:28:00,550
the you're in the onset of the seizures
at the did continue

464
00:28:00,550 --> 00:28:04,250
I am and over the course as the next

465
00:28:04,250 --> 00:28:07,700
several years and he started
experiencing

466
00:28:07,700 --> 00:28:11,740
more and more neurological problems with
it

467
00:28:11,740 --> 00:28:14,980
that we were just never able to to track
down

468
00:28:14,980 --> 00:28:19,710
the to there was never able to track
down the cause a

469
00:28:19,710 --> 00:28:22,850
on you know the those of you who met

470
00:28:22,850 --> 00:28:26,060
land you know at any point in a in the
last

471
00:28:26,060 --> 00:28:29,178
I guess for five years probably remember
he walked with a cane

472
00:28:29,179 --> 00:28:32,420
am that was because and his sad

473
00:28:32,420 --> 00:28:35,929
his back was slowly degenerating on him
arm

474
00:28:35,929 --> 00:28:40,400
and he was he was terrified just
absolutely terrified

475
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:44,920
I love out of losing his mobility I love
not being able to finish his PhD

476
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:50,230
have and a disappointing everybody that
he respected and

477
00:28:50,230 --> 00:28:54,840
he cared about him and he had spiked
fact it

478
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:58,390
we always told him you know look you
know we we love you we know you're

479
00:28:58,390 --> 00:28:59,310
brilliant

480
00:28:59,310 --> 00:29:03,510
you don't have to prove anything to us
an hour he still felt like you to prove

481
00:29:03,510 --> 00:29:04,879
it himself

482
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:10,160
and so yeah on

483
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:14,370
last summer I had to you on had to get
Houston

484
00:29:14,370 --> 00:29:18,440
add abruptly down because other now

485
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:22,690
now it seems kinda silly but my milder
the cat who left my parents

486
00:29:22,690 --> 00:29:28,640
night boot Belgium

487
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:31,810
the cat died

488
00:29:31,810 --> 00:29:35,780
freeh's my family for a little bit
tornadoes can have to stick around for

489
00:29:35,780 --> 00:29:39,080
a bit longer for work on so

490
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:43,928
arranged for a friend mind to mother a
printer print both cars really turn

491
00:29:43,929 --> 00:29:48,060
fly out to the Belgian just you take
care of them

492
00:29:48,060 --> 00:29:51,149
here to take care of any other the stuff
that you help with around the house

493
00:29:51,150 --> 00:29:53,830
because an ability problems he was
having

494
00:29:53,830 --> 00:29:58,620
and so home

495
00:29:58,620 --> 00:30:02,200
yet to get to get a Belgian 100 morning
July 3rd

496
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:05,470
goes to the apartment am

497
00:30:05,470 --> 00:30:08,530
you but no answer the doorbell so he
went to the

498
00:30:08,530 --> 00:30:12,730
an go to church Street borrowed latter

499
00:30:12,730 --> 00:30:16,800
climbed in the window and found land
hanging from Ward

500
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:22,230
cell

501
00:30:22,230 --> 00:30:26,870
and I think the hardest part about that
really was the

502
00:30:26,870 --> 00:30:30,250
they were very very few people who had

503
00:30:30,250 --> 00:30:34,580
any idea on just how far things have
gone

504
00:30:34,580 --> 00:30:37,590
mean even even I'm really didn't now

505
00:30:37,590 --> 00:30:40,950
but you know the the one refrain

506
00:30:40,950 --> 00:30:45,860
that I just heard over and over again in
the days following

507
00:30:45,860 --> 00:30:50,010
was you know we we never knew he always
seemed like he was doing fine

508
00:30:50,010 --> 00:30:53,700
but that's the point you know when he
would come to conferences

509
00:30:53,700 --> 00:30:59,280
that was it we had we had friends of
course you know who would come over and

510
00:30:59,280 --> 00:30:59,870
hang out

511
00:30:59,870 --> 00:31:04,260
in Belgium by you know he didn't leave
BP wasn't

512
00:31:04,260 --> 00:31:07,960
physically able to get out a lot I am
and he be loved

513
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:11,660
do in conferences and seeing people on
the you know that was that was also a

514
00:31:11,660 --> 00:31:15,830
lot of stress on him because he just
felt like he had to keep up this facade

515
00:31:15,830 --> 00:31:19,669
I love being the the same hyper company
guy

516
00:31:19,670 --> 00:31:22,679
that everybody had gotten to know when
he moved to the Bay Area back in

517
00:31:22,679 --> 00:31:24,260
nineteen on

518
00:31:24,260 --> 00:31:28,379
on and I think the reason for

519
00:31:28,380 --> 00:31:32,200
you have for that is like I said there's
there there's this stigma

520
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:36,160
thats attached to you to depression
people think we'll know what do you have

521
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:39,320
to be sad about your life is fine and
it's not about

522
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:43,570
being sad you know I've experienced
episodic depression I've had other

523
00:31:43,570 --> 00:31:44,350
friends of mine

524
00:31:44,350 --> 00:31:47,370
kill themselves to on

525
00:31:47,370 --> 00:31:50,580
but that's not the same as having

526
00:31:50,580 --> 00:31:54,949
E you know it your brain chemistry
constantly sabotaging you

527
00:31:54,950 --> 00:31:59,820
on a daily basis on and that is nobody's
fucking fault

528
00:31:59,820 --> 00:32:02,889
that is no peaceful pitched at fucking
luck

529
00:32:02,890 --> 00:32:06,940
and so you know if there's one thing I
want to accomplish and this

530
00:32:06,940 --> 00:32:09,950
its to get rid of it its its to get rid
of her fucking statement

531
00:32:09,950 --> 00:32:16,950
is that's what kills people

532
00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:22,340
to

533
00:32:22,340 --> 00:32:29,340
its

534
00:32:34,310 --> 00:32:38,470
sauna say thank you to all these folks
for being willing to share

535
00:32:38,470 --> 00:32:43,440
stories an because hopefully people are
feeling connected to the stories

536
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:47,660
hmmm and it's the emotional content that
we were social beings and silly resonate

537
00:32:47,660 --> 00:32:51,040
with that emotional content and

538
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:54,810
livingstone into Q&A for our panelists
what

539
00:32:54,810 --> 00:33:00,350
what are some other things that you find
to be

540
00:33:00,350 --> 00:33:03,450
difficult about being part of hacker
culture

541
00:33:03,450 --> 00:33:06,560
and what are some other things that you
find to be hopeful

542
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:10,210
about being part of hacker culture
compared to mainstream when it comes to

543
00:33:10,210 --> 00:33:16,530
talking about mental health stuff home

544
00:33:16,530 --> 00:33:21,500
see mom maturity matters

545
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:27,520
agriculture in moms parents the same
here is the signal around depression and

546
00:33:27,520 --> 00:33:29,070
suicidal thoughts

547
00:33:29,070 --> 00:33:33,470
Honourable Society and I think that goes

548
00:33:33,470 --> 00:33:36,740
across all cultures universally

549
00:33:36,740 --> 00:33:39,990
planet hmm

550
00:33:39,990 --> 00:33:43,420
in our culture it's really bad
especially is males

551
00:33:43,420 --> 00:33:47,310
to be considered weak hmm

552
00:33:47,310 --> 00:33:50,790
and arm depression makes you look weak

553
00:33:50,790 --> 00:33:54,139
you have no control over your and when
when

554
00:33:54,140 --> 00:33:58,380
numbers have control over motions or
feelings we have emotions or feelings

555
00:33:58,380 --> 00:33:59,000
with

556
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:02,200
we can't control them but depression is
who

557
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:06,870
Big Ten it so bad it's one of the things
which is not supposed to talk about

558
00:34:06,870 --> 00:34:10,110
and yet so many of us are to let

559
00:34:10,110 --> 00:34:14,770
I me maybe if there's one thing
different in half the culture maybe more

560
00:34:14,770 --> 00:34:15,830
people in

561
00:34:15,830 --> 00:34:20,020
the geek scenes I'll experience
depression

562
00:34:20,020 --> 00:34:24,380
because so many of us grew up
introverted and introverted Keeks

563
00:34:24,380 --> 00:34:27,450
and maybe it's old hopefully better now
when

564
00:34:27,449 --> 00:34:32,060
being cute little kid is almost cool cuz
everyone knows geeks make all the cool

565
00:34:32,060 --> 00:34:32,840
to go is

566
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:35,990
tell y'all play with liza

567
00:34:35,990 --> 00:34:40,060
kidder's I related a little be geek was

568
00:34:40,060 --> 00:34:45,710
incredibly dangerous when the worst
things you can call the worst thing was

569
00:34:45,710 --> 00:34:47,130
fag anime both

570
00:34:47,130 --> 00:34:50,970
so from I'm

571
00:34:50,970 --> 00:34:56,210
yeah still going up to 100 economies lot
of this deal with a lot of stuff that

572
00:34:56,210 --> 00:34:59,880
is really something would be better that
no one ever dealt with being

573
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:04,070
bullied for being who you are hmm

574
00:35:04,070 --> 00:35:07,360
we internalize that having no outlet
because there's no one to talk to you

575
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:08,910
about it for many years

576
00:35:08,910 --> 00:35:12,600
unfortunately so we just learn it's
better to hide it

577
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:16,520
hmm so many people including myself

578
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:20,210
from you become really good actors at
hiding

579
00:35:20,210 --> 00:35:23,670
what's inside of us knowing that other
people don't want to deal with that or

580
00:35:23,670 --> 00:35:24,480
believing it

581
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:28,190
and quite often stream so

582
00:35:28,190 --> 00:35:32,090
it's really difficult for people to know
what we're going through an

583
00:35:32,090 --> 00:35:37,250
so we don't have any positive
experiences arming people supporting us

584
00:35:37,250 --> 00:35:40,560
and we see that when we act like
everything's okay

585
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:44,730
every person's okay selectors as
positive reinforcement that we should

586
00:35:44,730 --> 00:35:46,260
keep doing that even more

587
00:35:46,260 --> 00:35:50,820
hmm but know if we do that then

588
00:35:50,820 --> 00:35:55,860
home if we need help were no one's gonna
give it to us because no one who's

589
00:35:55,860 --> 00:36:00,700
things get more monahan this happened to

590
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:04,130
my friend Julia quite work with who

591
00:36:04,130 --> 00:36:07,950
words so seriously depressed and noms

592
00:36:07,950 --> 00:36:11,970
do any number of people including myself
would have done anything

593
00:36:11,970 --> 00:36:17,130
we could have to help but no one knew so

594
00:36:17,130 --> 00:36:22,090
mmm you know when I'm fine now if I E
need help I can ask for it

595
00:36:22,090 --> 00:36:26,160
and I would love it if in our scheme
especially

596
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:30,310
you could be open and honest about all
of who we are even the parts were not

597
00:36:30,310 --> 00:36:32,040
comfortable with themselves

598
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:35,990
because we can see the other people
share many of those aspects

599
00:36:35,990 --> 00:36:40,300
and we won't feel so along with it and
we can ask for help maybe live another

600
00:36:40,300 --> 00:36:41,140
day

601
00:36:41,140 --> 00:36:45,540
when we really need help and even when
it's not so bad we can ask for help in

602
00:36:45,540 --> 00:36:46,180
beam

603
00:36:46,180 --> 00:36:50,980
live our lives much better no harm
friendly supportive

604
00:36:50,980 --> 00:36:54,490
community I'm mom

605
00:36:54,490 --> 00:36:58,070
months you know again my olives were
here

606
00:36:58,070 --> 00:37:01,160
sharing our stories hopefully

607
00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:04,170
as robin said G resonate with some 10

608
00:37:04,170 --> 00:37:09,010
can carry that on your lives and maybe
help other people when they reach anger

609
00:37:09,010 --> 00:37:14,250
hopefully you can reach out when you
want some help to has so um

610
00:37:14,250 --> 00:37:17,290
and generally found the hackers hinted
to speedy

611
00:37:17,290 --> 00:37:22,520
trio the barely open minded in general
much more than the standard population

612
00:37:22,520 --> 00:37:23,080
so

613
00:37:23,080 --> 00:37:27,020
um I'm yet to experience any kinda

614
00:37:27,020 --> 00:37:30,050
the the same negative stigma that I've

615
00:37:30,050 --> 00:37:33,690
I experienced another cultures when I
say that you know I'm suffering from

616
00:37:33,690 --> 00:37:36,150
depression and things like that cuz I
mean like

617
00:37:36,150 --> 00:37:40,110
significant chunk a Packers team is
varying degrees a autism and other

618
00:37:40,110 --> 00:37:42,010
problems you know insist

619
00:37:42,010 --> 00:37:45,420
that their um doesn't necessarily mean
that everybody is open

620
00:37:45,420 --> 00:37:48,809
and i'd that there is in a statement
just haven't felt that as harshly

621
00:37:48,809 --> 00:37:52,680
on something the mission I talked about
on the phone that I really wanna get up

622
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:55,950
and running and hopefully other people
are willing to do this as well

623
00:37:55,950 --> 00:37:59,339
is getting the worst emails that people
can email

624
00:37:59,339 --> 00:38:03,630
and hopefully like listing things said
willing to talk about you know so I'm

625
00:38:03,630 --> 00:38:07,330
and you know I can deal with depression
and

626
00:38:07,330 --> 00:38:11,029
and on being obsessive compulsive I'm a
rape survivor

627
00:38:11,030 --> 00:38:14,680
and I have dealt with a lot of physical
therapy in problems

628
00:38:14,680 --> 00:38:17,970
and there's a problem so it's like being
able and willing to talk

629
00:38:17,970 --> 00:38:22,380
to others and have a way of doing that
and having these email addresses 9

630
00:38:22,380 --> 00:38:23,310
archived

631
00:38:23,310 --> 00:38:27,100
inability to email anonymously if you
wish

632
00:38:27,100 --> 00:38:31,400
arm to keep yourself quiet but I'm
certainly gonna put up an email address

633
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:33,270
it'll do stand-up ultimately be like him

634
00:38:33,270 --> 00:38:36,720
their depression and ginger rogers & am

635
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:39,880
even when I am in my most reclusive
state

636
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:43,560
that is the kind of thing that I can a
check cuz it seem

637
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:48,460
is kinda strange that arm even when I'm
make mired in my own depression and not

638
00:38:48,460 --> 00:38:50,280
willing to talk to anybody about
anything

639
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:54,140
for some reason helping other people and
talking to them about their own

640
00:38:54,140 --> 00:38:55,270
depression helps me

641
00:38:55,270 --> 00:38:59,500
and on there was something that was
incredibly helpful

642
00:38:59,500 --> 00:39:03,020
in this most recent on bout on 1 May
roommates

643
00:39:03,020 --> 00:39:08,390
in Berlin me realise after a while there
Tom when we were in our rooms buyers

644
00:39:08,390 --> 00:39:09,270
salty reduced

645
00:39:09,270 --> 00:39:14,000
kinda hanging out just like watchin
movies or playing video games

646
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,960
by ourselves and Herman eventually we
started hanging out im playing video

647
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:17,830
games and

648
00:39:17,830 --> 00:39:21,460
watching movies together in being
depressed together in the kitchen

649
00:39:21,460 --> 00:39:25,950
but it was nice because arm then that
took away a lot of the edge for

650
00:39:25,950 --> 00:39:29,630
I don't feel like getting up to Lake
boil the water to make the TVA's just

651
00:39:29,630 --> 00:39:30,900
think so much trouble

652
00:39:30,900 --> 00:39:35,420
on but you know what the other person
there it's it's hopeful um so

653
00:39:35,420 --> 00:39:38,930
having that email resources be very nice
and her dad loved her

654
00:39:38,930 --> 00:39:42,810
see other people and arm themselves i'm
ok we'll get together something a wiki

655
00:39:42,810 --> 00:39:44,820
page urge the method have adding

656
00:39:44,820 --> 00:39:48,540
people to that on I guess as we talk
about it later

657
00:39:48,540 --> 00:39:54,000
some definitely think in this community
it's a lot easier to talk about

658
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:59,370
be the etiology have depression and
other mental illnesses

659
00:39:59,370 --> 00:40:02,839
I mean hell like if I covered my aunt
and uncle's place I dumping I can even

660
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:05,200
use the word ideology wouldn't know it
meant

661
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:08,530
arm you know and and

662
00:40:08,530 --> 00:40:12,590
you know that's that's actually they can
be helpful from a practical standpoint

663
00:40:12,590 --> 00:40:16,050
although you know it it certainly is not
a comfortable feeling to feel like a bug

664
00:40:16,050 --> 00:40:17,440
microscope slide either

665
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:21,350
om by you know that said and

666
00:40:21,350 --> 00:40:25,170
you know when I certainly struggled

667
00:40:25,170 --> 00:40:28,880
with you know the with the the medical
community

668
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:33,160
and you know when we were when we were
dealing with his seizure disorder

669
00:40:33,160 --> 00:40:37,350
I am we had to fight tooth and nail
against

670
00:40:37,350 --> 00:40:41,230
neurologist who swore up and down that
the premise and could not possibly have

671
00:40:41,230 --> 00:40:42,410
been implicated in

672
00:40:42,410 --> 00:40:45,640
in in in the seizures he was having and
then

673
00:40:45,640 --> 00:40:50,390
like while he was in a while he was in
the hospital he accidentally got dosed

674
00:40:50,390 --> 00:40:50,770
with

675
00:40:50,770 --> 00:40:55,000
selling adderall which is premise and
bigger nasty brother and instead at the

676
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:58,010
headquarters and that he was supposed to
be getting in and you know within 12

677
00:40:58,010 --> 00:40:59,330
hours seizure so bad

678
00:40:59,330 --> 00:41:03,430
date four milligrams out and didn't do
anything to it AL

679
00:41:03,430 --> 00:41:07,359
endeared then the neurology showed up
and apologized great babe you know

680
00:41:07,360 --> 00:41:08,000
there's a

681
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:12,250
I think there's sort of a lack of ego in
in this community you

682
00:41:12,250 --> 00:41:19,250
when dealing with on you know areas that
we don't understand very well so I think

683
00:41:19,370 --> 00:41:20,400
I think people are

684
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:23,810
relatively good about I am

685
00:41:23,810 --> 00:41:27,799
just sort of trying to understand you
know what what is the

686
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:32,340
the physical root of this problem so I
guess there's that

687
00:41:32,340 --> 00:41:35,470
my and my experience

688
00:41:35,470 --> 00:41:42,020
in the hacker community on was that I
was not really able to you

689
00:41:42,020 --> 00:41:45,310
talk about feeling bad war

690
00:41:45,310 --> 00:41:49,400
being depressed because the overall
attitude was partly just

691
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:52,580
com well everybody feels bad and I'll

692
00:41:52,580 --> 00:41:56,060
why are you complaining arm and also

693
00:41:56,060 --> 00:42:02,049
has a woman arm when I entered the
hacker seen in most women hackers teams

694
00:42:02,050 --> 00:42:07,090
were still like having their credibility
is actual keats called into question on

695
00:42:07,090 --> 00:42:11,020
a basically constant basis and I
definitely had that experience as well

696
00:42:11,020 --> 00:42:14,910
and the general response to me was

697
00:42:14,910 --> 00:42:18,000
well you're a girl so everybody

698
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:22,540
is giving you attention you can possibly
have problems and if you have problems

699
00:42:22,540 --> 00:42:23,290
while you're just

700
00:42:23,290 --> 00:42:26,830
being an attention whore urge seeking a
hom

701
00:42:26,830 --> 00:42:29,960
approval your attention from other
people

702
00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:33,070
and I eventually learned to you

703
00:42:33,070 --> 00:42:36,210
pretty much just shut up and play me
Lake

704
00:42:36,210 --> 00:42:40,450
the mutual abuse came socially and

705
00:42:40,450 --> 00:42:43,970
they got harder and harder and more
unpleasant om

706
00:42:43,970 --> 00:42:48,410
and it pretty much led me to withdrew in
it to withdraw completely and I didn't

707
00:42:48,410 --> 00:42:49,759
have

708
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:53,590
and experience acceptance /url any of my
mental

709
00:42:53,590 --> 00:42:57,420
Lake experiences are conditions until I
went to the west coast

710
00:42:57,420 --> 00:43:01,740
and went through a period of just
talking openly about

711
00:43:01,740 --> 00:43:05,940
mine feelings and experiences in a
deliberate effort to get people to

712
00:43:05,940 --> 00:43:07,030
reject me

713
00:43:07,030 --> 00:43:11,810
and to get to the point where I would be
socially ostracized for being fucked up

714
00:43:11,810 --> 00:43:15,200
and that didn't happen thankfully

715
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:20,470
and it was it was a new experience for
me because I was used to a very

716
00:43:20,470 --> 00:43:25,750
harsh and hard-edged om tabor social
interaction we really good

717
00:43:25,750 --> 00:43:29,550
like a herd were be heard if you

718
00:43:29,550 --> 00:43:34,370
word not hurting somebody your target

719
00:43:34,370 --> 00:43:37,740
on man and also took me awhile to

720
00:43:37,740 --> 00:43:41,720
work myself added the mindset love
people are just automatically target me

721
00:43:41,720 --> 00:43:42,990
if I'm not

722
00:43:42,990 --> 00:43:46,050
really really really careful and

723
00:43:46,050 --> 00:43:50,890
I A relaxed a lot over the past couple
of years and gone able to like even

724
00:43:50,890 --> 00:43:54,850
even talk about my experiences but back
then I was never

725
00:43:54,850 --> 00:43:59,160
evil teal and that external Nana
knowledge min Lin also tuning

726
00:43:59,160 --> 00:44:02,730
internal non-ecc knowledge meant that I
E

727
00:44:02,730 --> 00:44:06,750
my colleague reinforced the internal
monologue get ahead

728
00:44:06,750 --> 00:44:10,590
all my problems for my fault to begin
with and

729
00:44:10,590 --> 00:44:14,170
anything that on

730
00:44:14,170 --> 00:44:17,460
that I was needful to fix on my known
was just

731
00:44:17,460 --> 00:44:22,650
because I suck that much or that I was
that much for failure

732
00:44:22,650 --> 00:44:27,850
com say I guess my experience was

733
00:44:27,850 --> 00:44:32,360
lead in the hacker scene like you can do
a lot of damage to each other by playing

734
00:44:32,360 --> 00:44:33,770
that game

735
00:44:33,770 --> 00:44:40,770
and the game went along perlman went on
for a long long time

736
00:44:47,320 --> 00:44:49,740
home so tell me and tell me a little bit
more

737
00:44:49,740 --> 00:44:55,490
about an addiction and self-harm another
self sabotaging

738
00:44:55,490 --> 00:44:58,720
certain behaviors what does that look
like

739
00:44:58,720 --> 00:45:05,720
how do you get outer that cycle speak
more about that and so

740
00:45:06,099 --> 00:45:09,650
Ola go ahead cuz a

741
00:45:09,650 --> 00:45:14,470
pretty much recently and banned myself
from like video games and watching

742
00:45:14,470 --> 00:45:16,760
anything by myself and

743
00:45:16,760 --> 00:45:22,770
and a number of other things I'm just
let you know it is

744
00:45:22,770 --> 00:45:26,180
practice and getting absolutely nothing
done

745
00:45:26,180 --> 00:45:31,190
and so on on fortunately or
unfortunately depending on who I talk to

746
00:45:31,190 --> 00:45:33,700
you I'm actually allergic to pot and a
few other

747
00:45:33,700 --> 00:45:36,750
substances so I never dug was never an
option

748
00:45:36,750 --> 00:45:42,260
Press Cape for me um and I don't really
like to be drunk

749
00:45:42,260 --> 00:45:45,500
I like drinking good beer in good wine
but I don't actually like the side

750
00:45:45,500 --> 00:45:46,790
effects most the time

751
00:45:46,790 --> 00:45:51,640
um and so major good choices been
escapism

752
00:45:51,640 --> 00:45:55,348
to slow down comets either um

753
00:45:55,349 --> 00:45:59,599
the watching entire television series

754
00:45:59,599 --> 00:46:03,839
all the way through Lake next-generation
a totally did that and Lake

755
00:46:03,839 --> 00:46:07,980
um City while god oh that's the

756
00:46:07,980 --> 00:46:10,980
ideas like 900 hours and companies
creating

757
00:46:10,980 --> 00:46:14,349
I'm so an

758
00:46:14,349 --> 00:46:17,470
yes I 18 like pretty much all love the
Star Trek

759
00:46:17,470 --> 00:46:21,339
ever and I um it legal head

760
00:46:21,339 --> 00:46:25,359
pick up with a new TV show and they
would watch all the seasons

761
00:46:25,359 --> 00:46:29,119
you notice all at once they call fire
six-year whenever seasons

762
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:34,020
on we're getting to like a crazy video
game when miners door fortress which

763
00:46:34,020 --> 00:46:38,369
I don't know how many people know what
that is but it is the New Years

764
00:46:38,369 --> 00:46:43,400
completely obsessive-compulsive game
ever there aren't any text graphics

765
00:46:43,400 --> 00:46:48,530
um and you can go down as far as you
want in a rabbit hole and I went down

766
00:46:48,530 --> 00:46:49,339
pretty far

767
00:46:49,339 --> 00:46:53,119
cell it's just constantly the

768
00:46:53,119 --> 00:46:56,369
going somewhere else that I am NOT

769
00:46:56,369 --> 00:46:59,410
and reading books

770
00:46:59,410 --> 00:47:03,460
um week you not need is reading them but
league-leading

771
00:47:03,460 --> 00:47:07,440
a lot of books is constantly a seem to
like pick a median and stick with it for

772
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:08,220
a little while

773
00:47:08,220 --> 00:47:11,550
I'm introduces that's totally fine in
like that the

774
00:47:11,550 --> 00:47:14,580
way for me to relax or whatever but I
had in the past few years

775
00:47:14,580 --> 00:47:18,200
allow that to continue to creep into my
daily life so much I I work for myself

776
00:47:18,200 --> 00:47:20,010
so it's kinda dangerous to

777
00:47:20,010 --> 00:47:23,089
allow those activities I'm just fine
leaders ban them

778
00:47:23,089 --> 00:47:26,230
a few months ago and I had dramatic

779
00:47:26,230 --> 00:47:30,330
improvements with some all the crap that
he needed to do because then you're

780
00:47:30,330 --> 00:47:30,880
stuck

781
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:33,910
as midge pointed out you can let their
lake well crap

782
00:47:33,910 --> 00:47:39,049
now get a deal with my shit and so I
started dealing with it

783
00:47:39,050 --> 00:47:44,099
and slippers you know is there just
kinda dealing with one HQ small things

784
00:47:44,099 --> 00:47:48,080
per day I am if they didn't really do
anything a dare disco make something

785
00:47:48,080 --> 00:47:51,799
on word is God's side um

786
00:47:51,800 --> 00:47:54,920
Minnesota working hard um a lot

787
00:47:54,920 --> 00:48:00,830
and that's helped and mentally on cuz
they have pretty sedentary after my Anna

788
00:48:00,830 --> 00:48:06,210
my stint in to scan a hanging around the
apartment in berlin not doing anything

789
00:48:06,210 --> 00:48:09,810
also moving to Berlin in the winner is
not a good idea

790
00:48:09,810 --> 00:48:13,190
and just in general

791
00:48:13,190 --> 00:48:16,710
I am and yet I'm moving there again for
the winner

792
00:48:16,710 --> 00:48:20,390
awesome um is

793
00:48:20,390 --> 00:48:26,990
still did your you can have harmful
behaviors not necessarily have to be

794
00:48:26,990 --> 00:48:30,780
um when a lot of people we consider harm

795
00:48:30,780 --> 00:48:34,180
harmful combine it can be a mean a lot
of people have

796
00:48:34,180 --> 00:48:37,169
what the work at addictions and all
kinds of other stuff I mean it could be

797
00:48:37,170 --> 00:48:39,530
pornography addiction it could be all
kinds of stuff

798
00:48:39,530 --> 00:48:43,180
on and like I said for me it's just

799
00:48:43,180 --> 00:48:48,118
me not being where I am or Who I am at
that moment and

800
00:48:48,119 --> 00:48:51,540
com because it it can be difficult to be
you

801
00:48:51,540 --> 00:48:54,540
me usually is by is

802
00:48:54,540 --> 00:48:58,359
hearted for most people at some points
um

803
00:48:58,359 --> 00:49:03,549
pain %um I don't think this is limited
to depression

804
00:49:03,550 --> 00:49:07,800
mean cuz like to see a nasty and one
other things they

805
00:49:07,800 --> 00:49:11,440
I A struggle with every freaking days
function process

806
00:49:11,440 --> 00:49:15,869
i mean you know the the the metaphorical
story about like the Doki between the

807
00:49:15,869 --> 00:49:17,000
two piles a pain

808
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:20,380
they're the same size and so he can
decide which one to eat first totaling

809
00:49:20,380 --> 00:49:25,330
lighten I i've got that they've got to
do list as long as this table

810
00:49:25,330 --> 00:49:29,460
and you know I oftentimes I just can't
pick

811
00:49:29,460 --> 00:49:32,560
the the most important thing to do

812
00:49:32,560 --> 00:49:36,040
and you know and the only thing and the
only thing productive did end up getting

813
00:49:36,040 --> 00:49:38,190
done that day is the cat gets fed

814
00:49:38,190 --> 00:49:42,750
piano and there's a whole lot I read it
and am at a valid

815
00:49:42,750 --> 00:49:46,680
am and yeah I know it's it's it's
challenging it really does negatively

816
00:49:46,680 --> 00:49:48,279
affect your mood even if

817
00:49:48,280 --> 00:49:51,859
chronic depression is not a problem you
have because

818
00:49:51,859 --> 00:49:55,720
here you realize man you know I'm I'm is

819
00:49:55,720 --> 00:49:58,859
especially if you're if you're if you're
if you're one of those people like I am

820
00:49:58,859 --> 00:49:59,600
who's always

821
00:49:59,600 --> 00:50:02,910
lady sorta valuing their self-worth on
the basis that the last thing they

822
00:50:02,910 --> 00:50:05,339
finished in how recently they finished
it

823
00:50:05,339 --> 00:50:09,089
am which again like totally not limited
to

824
00:50:09,089 --> 00:50:12,660
to people with depression I think that's
a pretty common character trait

825
00:50:12,660 --> 00:50:16,810
a just in the gay community in general

826
00:50:16,810 --> 00:50:19,900
but yeah I mean function process can
definitely lead to

827
00:50:19,900 --> 00:50:24,510
conduct can definitely lead to that
downward spiral

828
00:50:24,510 --> 00:50:27,830
%um now column

829
00:50:27,830 --> 00:50:32,790
addiction can take many forms and such a
jerk destructive behavior can take many

830
00:50:32,790 --> 00:50:34,440
forms

831
00:50:34,440 --> 00:50:37,740
arm you might think I'll

832
00:50:37,740 --> 00:50:42,920
mmm maybe her most people may be for
everyone or maybe just speaking for

833
00:50:42,920 --> 00:50:43,520
myself

834
00:50:43,520 --> 00:50:46,720
farm its low way to avoid

835
00:50:46,720 --> 00:50:51,180
myself 19 Cajun that you can be
conscious or otherwise

836
00:50:51,180 --> 00:50:54,740
when I was a little kid it was almost
always unconscious

837
00:50:54,740 --> 00:50:59,010
I hated myself that became part of my
identity

838
00:50:59,010 --> 00:51:03,380
known it still affects me to this day
I'm someone who hates myself

839
00:51:03,380 --> 00:51:07,410
that's part of my identity I don't it's
not as important

840
00:51:07,410 --> 00:51:11,899
a part of my identity as it used to be
all-consuming

841
00:51:11,900 --> 00:51:16,250
but that's a hard thing to confront on a
moment by moment day-to-day

842
00:51:16,250 --> 00:51:21,030
basis and there are many many many many
things

843
00:51:21,030 --> 00:51:24,410
that are socially sanctioned as well as
illegal

844
00:51:24,410 --> 00:51:29,680
arm ways to avoid dealing with those
things are very very difficult inside

845
00:51:29,680 --> 00:51:31,270
myself

846
00:51:31,270 --> 00:51:35,589
watching TV I mentioned pot other drugs

847
00:51:35,589 --> 00:51:40,100
because all sportsmen behaviors my
father was a total workaholic

848
00:51:40,100 --> 00:51:45,369
that was a great way for american dad to
do things prolly for many of us here

849
00:51:45,369 --> 00:51:49,250
arm known for her many of us here in the
community we

850
00:51:49,250 --> 00:51:53,859
really love a lot of the things we do
anything that gives us

851
00:51:53,859 --> 00:51:59,380
%uh enjoyment is a little bit gives us
enjoyment what bottle hot

852
00:51:59,380 --> 00:52:02,460
so arm anything is anything

853
00:52:02,460 --> 00:52:05,650
can be used to avoid oneself anything

854
00:52:05,650 --> 00:52:10,890
even things that are required a to live
a healthy happy existence

855
00:52:10,890 --> 00:52:14,420
sex food chocolate arm

856
00:52:14,420 --> 00:52:17,440
all these things can be used to work
ourselves

857
00:52:17,440 --> 00:52:21,089
and its up to you and you will loom

858
00:52:21,089 --> 00:52:24,880
whether those things are helping you are
hurting you were in different

859
00:52:24,880 --> 00:52:28,600
whether you're doing more of it would be
a good thing or a bad thing

860
00:52:28,600 --> 00:52:33,200
or may be doing last-minute might give
you more time to do something more

861
00:52:33,200 --> 00:52:35,920
fulfilling its totally up to you

862
00:52:35,920 --> 00:52:39,770
weathers destructive for it's up to you
as well

863
00:52:39,770 --> 00:52:43,089
and I'll no game this shit

864
00:52:43,089 --> 00:52:46,319
takes time to learn arm

865
00:52:46,319 --> 00:52:49,410
and mark took me years and years to use

866
00:52:49,410 --> 00:52:53,540
stop to learn to stop doing things are
getting where you living life I want to

867
00:52:53,540 --> 00:52:54,660
live

868
00:52:54,660 --> 00:52:57,710
tonight I don't think there are any
shortcuts mmm

869
00:52:57,710 --> 00:53:01,980
mean we have as long as we have on the
planet to work through this

870
00:53:01,980 --> 00:53:05,930
as much as we can if you want to we
don't have to

871
00:53:05,930 --> 00:53:09,240
hmm again that's totally up to you

872
00:53:09,240 --> 00:53:12,560
hmm you can also be kinda hard to

873
00:53:12,560 --> 00:53:17,420
distinguish like be a its it's not
necessarily clear-cut

874
00:53:17,420 --> 00:53:22,390
whether particular behavior is helpful
or harmful sometimes it's both

875
00:53:22,390 --> 00:53:25,750
you know my aid my a primary

876
00:53:25,750 --> 00:53:30,140
escape route is reading and and while
I'm certainly learning a lot

877
00:53:30,140 --> 00:53:34,950
when I you know pile up a stack of PDF's
and you know read papers all day

878
00:53:34,950 --> 00:53:38,660
I am that's still you know I it

879
00:53:38,660 --> 00:53:42,060
it it is still frequently the case that
you know that's that's

880
00:53:42,060 --> 00:53:45,400
that I'm doing that because time
avoiding

881
00:53:45,400 --> 00:53:50,040
something else I am you know okay sure
on one hand I'm learning lots of math

882
00:53:50,040 --> 00:53:50,810
and that's great

883
00:53:50,810 --> 00:53:54,440
and and may even prove useful later but
it's not a particularly healthy behavior

884
00:53:54,440 --> 00:53:57,609
to the extent that I often carry it

885
00:53:57,609 --> 00:54:01,069
when I was a kid I had to you hmm p.m.

886
00:54:01,069 --> 00:54:04,350
I spend a lot of time pretty isolated

887
00:54:04,350 --> 00:54:10,049
and I also mom was not allowed to you
watch TV

888
00:54:10,050 --> 00:54:13,600
i wasnt really allowed to listen to
music

889
00:54:13,600 --> 00:54:16,740
most of the time on

890
00:54:16,740 --> 00:54:20,260
after a while I didn't really have

891
00:54:20,260 --> 00:54:24,350
friends because my and my mom was I
don't know what she was she never saw

892
00:54:24,350 --> 00:54:28,819
therapist but she got more and more
knots as time went on and more and more

893
00:54:28,819 --> 00:54:32,240
isolated and I got more and more
isolated with her as well

894
00:54:32,240 --> 00:54:35,520
and I would kill for periods have months
to like

895
00:54:35,520 --> 00:54:40,800
a year to time without seen other people
besides her

896
00:54:40,800 --> 00:54:47,190
mom and because if the treatment I was
receiving from her and

897
00:54:47,190 --> 00:54:52,220
the general like honestly just lack of
things to do two things to like

898
00:54:52,220 --> 00:54:55,790
distract myself with her engaging
escapism with

899
00:54:55,790 --> 00:55:00,400
arm I became disassociated

900
00:55:00,400 --> 00:55:05,600
and I got to play like if I had to spend
a lifetime just sitting in one place for

901
00:55:05,600 --> 00:55:06,339
a while

902
00:55:06,339 --> 00:55:11,470
or like not really have anything to do
you like ages came to blink blink myself

903
00:55:11,470 --> 00:55:15,020
out in going to like this

904
00:55:15,020 --> 00:55:18,730
inner like world

905
00:55:18,730 --> 00:55:21,970
that I didn't exist in and

906
00:55:21,970 --> 00:55:25,160
that was just k know how I cope with the
new kid

907
00:55:25,160 --> 00:55:29,399
on man as an adult it became a problem I
K I have

908
00:55:29,400 --> 00:55:33,500
a lot of the functional black brown
system errors was talking about

909
00:55:33,500 --> 00:55:37,480
and I have to write lists and I have to
read different lists in different types

910
00:55:37,480 --> 00:55:39,589
of lists and I have to you

911
00:55:39,589 --> 00:55:44,720
trick myself into completing tasks are
said to tasks

912
00:55:44,720 --> 00:55:48,310
on because if I rail listening to keep
writing the same style

913
00:55:48,310 --> 00:55:52,859
list I'll be able to write things on the
list and put it away and forget about it

914
00:55:52,859 --> 00:55:54,980
and I haven't done anything

915
00:55:54,980 --> 00:55:59,640
arm so I have to change the types of
lists a half the change how I

916
00:55:59,640 --> 00:56:04,310
implement reminders to do things or how
I pattern

917
00:56:04,310 --> 00:56:08,359
on routines cuz I'll do routine
completely

918
00:56:08,359 --> 00:56:11,720
for like several weeks and then I will
just be unable to do it

919
00:56:11,720 --> 00:56:14,990
I'll have to switch to a different
routine hom

920
00:56:14,990 --> 00:56:19,470
and I got into mom drugs means escapism

921
00:56:19,470 --> 00:56:22,700
how one point and a detailed

922
00:56:22,700 --> 00:56:26,460
law Avandia me for quite a while

923
00:56:26,460 --> 00:56:31,339
and no burns receptors doing it but
eventually I stopped on my own because

924
00:56:31,339 --> 00:56:33,670
it is pretty much stopped working

925
00:56:33,670 --> 00:56:37,200
but in the process I had been able to
you

926
00:56:37,200 --> 00:56:40,640
crack open some things inside my head
just few

927
00:56:40,640 --> 00:56:44,259
harm just really if Excel what it does

928
00:56:44,260 --> 00:56:49,780
and the talking that I was able to do
even though was not to a therapist or

929
00:56:49,780 --> 00:56:54,200
anyone really helpful oh she's able to
start unpacking things looking at them

930
00:56:54,200 --> 00:56:57,569
and even though the overall a factor

931
00:56:57,569 --> 00:57:02,220
on on my physical body was actually
really detrimental

932
00:57:02,220 --> 00:57:06,420
the hooks into my psyche that it gave me
your actually

933
00:57:06,420 --> 00:57:10,720
very very helpful in possibly crucial to
me getting into any kind of recovery

934
00:57:10,720 --> 00:57:12,260
state

935
00:57:12,260 --> 00:57:18,510
on seven and that's not not a path that
I recommend that people to stick

936
00:57:18,510 --> 00:57:22,799
hmm I don't recommend you didn't happen

937
00:57:22,799 --> 00:57:26,259
I was kind of lucky any being able to
you

938
00:57:26,260 --> 00:57:29,549
recover from it to the extent that I
have

939
00:57:29,549 --> 00:57:32,690
moms who drugs can be helpful dead skin
heard

940
00:57:32,690 --> 00:57:35,710
a lot as well and

941
00:57:35,710 --> 00:57:39,740
it's kind of a personal exercises to you
what you keep love and what you feel

942
00:57:39,740 --> 00:57:42,700
that you can undertake and if you say no
this is not me then

943
00:57:42,700 --> 00:57:47,960
absolutely Lake that's your prerogative
don't do something that

944
00:57:47,960 --> 00:57:51,600
you find damaging per usual just doesn't
work for somebody else

945
00:57:51,600 --> 00:57:55,830
his everybody's different and everybody
needs different things

946
00:57:55,830 --> 00:58:00,660
I've heard therapists actually using
MDMA as energies into therapy

947
00:58:00,660 --> 00:58:05,009
I hate that's not something they can
really be done openly in this country

948
00:58:05,010 --> 00:58:08,170
you know I actually just went to a
seminar

949
00:58:08,170 --> 00:58:13,140
mom that talked about a study a re
pretty rigorous formal study that was

950
00:58:13,140 --> 00:58:13,720
done

951
00:58:13,720 --> 00:58:19,369
on MD me therapy for people with PTSD
both veterans and like

952
00:58:19,369 --> 00:58:24,200
our childhood abuse victims and the
recovery rate may be found

953
00:58:24,200 --> 00:58:29,200
was absolutely profound Lake knock you
over pretty much almost everybody

954
00:58:29,200 --> 00:58:30,380
recovered

955
00:58:30,380 --> 00:58:33,690
to an amazing degree in and the drug was
maybe

956
00:58:33,690 --> 00:58:37,850
10 percent of the interaction and it was
a full day therapy session

957
00:58:37,850 --> 00:58:41,670
with two therapists wire on the MDMA
daily

958
00:58:41,670 --> 00:58:46,630
mom check-ins for a week after with the
therapists and then like weekly therapy

959
00:58:46,630 --> 00:58:48,930
for a few months after that the

960
00:58:48,930 --> 00:58:52,150
there was a home a lot to like

961
00:58:52,150 --> 00:58:56,080
very intensive therapeutic assistance
integrating experience

962
00:58:56,080 --> 00:59:01,109
by everybody who took part in the study
found it to be profoundly helpful

963
00:59:01,109 --> 00:59:04,880
even the people who had the experience
once and said

964
00:59:04,880 --> 00:59:09,460
this was Green I'm never doing it again
they still came out a bit

965
00:59:09,460 --> 00:59:13,869
profoundly better for

966
00:59:13,869 --> 00:59:18,190
that was who put on the study 90
meanwhile the drugs I'm done

967
00:59:18,190 --> 00:59:22,170
I did them because their therapeutic
effect on the positive

968
00:59:22,170 --> 00:59:25,420
therapy defect affect on me but not

969
00:59:25,420 --> 00:59:29,910
therapeutic setting only just wanna
repeat with the person in the audience

970
00:59:29,910 --> 00:59:32,020
said maps data word

971
00:59:32,020 --> 00:59:35,150
is the our organization that is

972
00:59:35,150 --> 00:59:38,880
om helping do the studies for India me

973
00:59:38,880 --> 00:59:42,510
and other drugs in a therapeutic
settings sale

974
00:59:42,510 --> 00:59:46,750
if you wanna check that out and support
them please do and also for migraines

975
00:59:46,750 --> 00:59:51,780
yeah and so again you know not
therapeutic setting and being you know

976
00:59:51,780 --> 00:59:55,069
young teenager or even twenties or
whatever and he just doesn't really

977
00:59:55,069 --> 00:59:56,020
matter

978
00:59:56,020 --> 01:00:00,450
beam and words not are conducive for

979
01:00:00,450 --> 01:00:05,280
necessarily healing I I can use it in
healing Wayne learned a lot from it and

980
01:00:05,280 --> 01:00:08,520
I wouldn't read any of their way for
anything but I wouldn't recommend

981
01:00:08,520 --> 01:00:11,920
mystery that route for aid anybody arm

982
01:00:11,920 --> 01:00:14,970
and again if a little bit

983
01:00:14,970 --> 01:00:19,270
helped what would a lot to when I wanted
a lot and I want it now

984
01:00:19,270 --> 01:00:22,290
and I was not being patient myself so

985
01:00:22,290 --> 01:00:26,869
and I'm not feels awesome at the time it
really does but it's it's not been a

986
01:00:26,869 --> 01:00:30,750
help you in a therapeutic long-term
sense at all

987
01:00:30,750 --> 01:00:35,640
so into in the Vino talking about too
much worse is not enough talk to me

988
01:00:35,640 --> 01:00:37,540
about

989
01:00:37,540 --> 01:00:41,529
text me about who you are verses what
you deal

990
01:00:41,530 --> 01:00:47,260
and Howell how we support each other in

991
01:00:47,260 --> 01:00:52,190
feeling good about who we are because of
who we are not because of what we

992
01:00:52,190 --> 01:00:53,140
achieved

993
01:00:53,140 --> 01:00:56,900
talk to me about to I can address

994
01:00:56,900 --> 01:00:59,970
had home

995
01:00:59,970 --> 01:01:03,140
you know we all have different world
views the and

996
01:01:03,140 --> 01:01:06,319
necessarily may have to put the world
together

997
01:01:06,319 --> 01:01:10,350
each in our own way arm to my
experiences

998
01:01:10,350 --> 01:01:14,509
big are the way I put the world together
for me

999
01:01:14,510 --> 01:01:18,450
is I have absolutely no control
whatsoever

1000
01:01:18,450 --> 01:01:21,609
in the world out there I perceive out
there

1001
01:01:21,609 --> 01:01:26,890
I A have very little control over the
world inside of me

1002
01:01:26,890 --> 01:01:30,480
I know control absolutely no control
whatsoever

1003
01:01:30,480 --> 01:01:33,790
over what I feel if you know what I feel

1004
01:01:33,790 --> 01:01:36,980
I have very little control over what I
think

1005
01:01:36,980 --> 01:01:40,430
hmm I have some control over from

1006
01:01:40,430 --> 01:01:46,280
but I think to the extent that I have a
lot of control over what I choose to do

1007
01:01:46,280 --> 01:01:50,069
home and there's love external
circumstances that impinge on that but

1008
01:01:50,069 --> 01:01:52,950
ultimately it's up to me when I choose
to do

1009
01:01:52,950 --> 01:01:56,509
and have a lot of control over that but
I have no control over the consequences

1010
01:01:56,509 --> 01:01:57,029
of that

1011
01:01:57,029 --> 01:02:00,710
mine but due to the choice they will
have

1012
01:02:00,710 --> 01:02:04,410
feelings there will be consequences the
external world that are perceived not

1013
01:02:04,410 --> 01:02:07,100
have feelings about it not thoughts
about it

1014
01:02:07,100 --> 01:02:11,350
and if I choose to I can learn from all
about

1015
01:02:11,350 --> 01:02:14,420
make new choices

1016
01:02:14,420 --> 01:02:20,420
basically what to do what I do is not
who I am but what I do definitely as

1017
01:02:20,420 --> 01:02:24,089
consequences and as a result I have
feelings and I have thoughts

1018
01:02:24,089 --> 01:02:30,259
and I'm all about ends up changing me a
great deal

1019
01:02:30,259 --> 01:02:33,970
and so what I choose to do you mean
directly

1020
01:02:33,970 --> 01:02:37,160
does affect great way who I am

1021
01:02:37,160 --> 01:02:42,140
but I can choose who I am I can only
choose what to do and see what happens

1022
01:02:42,140 --> 01:02:45,620
and learn from it if I choose to and
then make new choices

1023
01:02:45,620 --> 01:02:50,220
and this is the process love my life in
one we looking at it

1024
01:02:50,220 --> 01:02:55,589
and that process for me is what gives my
life meaning

1025
01:02:55,589 --> 01:02:59,009
it's not about goals not about
accomplishments

1026
01:02:59,009 --> 01:03:02,390
arm throughout all that I do make

1027
01:03:02,390 --> 01:03:06,129
goals which gives me a direction to go
in

1028
01:03:06,130 --> 01:03:10,279
I do have accomplishments are you are
failures something spectacular

1029
01:03:10,279 --> 01:03:13,580
sometimes successes that are really
incredibly cool

1030
01:03:13,580 --> 01:03:17,190
arm but I have no control over a new
that I have control over what I choose

1031
01:03:17,190 --> 01:03:20,210
to do as a result of having those
experiences

1032
01:03:20,210 --> 01:03:23,210
which can lead to really cool things and
hopefully as I get %uh

1033
01:03:23,210 --> 01:03:27,190
more experience annoying myself and the
world around me

1034
01:03:27,190 --> 01:03:30,740
are more and more that can come I would
have no control over that

1035
01:03:30,740 --> 01:03:34,170
so from you these are the differences

1036
01:03:34,170 --> 01:03:37,900
as I see it between you know but I do my
accomplishments and

1037
01:03:37,900 --> 01:03:41,089
who I am arm and

1038
01:03:41,089 --> 01:03:47,170
all because the the choices that I me

1039
01:03:47,170 --> 01:03:50,430
and so I A actually a spent a good bit
have

1040
01:03:50,430 --> 01:03:54,810
my time II k disassociated from my body

1041
01:03:54,810 --> 01:03:58,400
and it's kind it's rainy day only met a
few other people they didn't have had

1042
01:03:58,400 --> 01:03:59,520
the same experience

1043
01:03:59,520 --> 01:04:03,130
a.m. usually pay leading some kinda me
robot

1044
01:04:03,130 --> 01:04:06,190
and I'm actually kinda behind myself
piloting

1045
01:04:06,190 --> 01:04:10,100
this mere about and on

1046
01:04:10,100 --> 01:04:13,620
it's the meter about the gives toxic
conferences

1047
01:04:13,620 --> 01:04:17,779
and so I don't have to feel those
motions that's over there that that's

1048
01:04:17,779 --> 01:04:18,430
the robot

1049
01:04:18,430 --> 01:04:21,589
killing those emotions um

1050
01:04:21,589 --> 01:04:26,569
so oftentimes the person that a present
in public is not necessarily who I am

1051
01:04:26,569 --> 01:04:30,040
in private common actually kinda been
interpreted

1052
01:04:30,040 --> 01:04:34,040
paper person um it's kind of interesting
because

1053
01:04:34,040 --> 01:04:38,740
this depression panel is hitting so
close to home and pulling so many things

1054
01:04:38,740 --> 01:04:39,850
that I'm actually

1055
01:04:39,850 --> 01:04:43,740
here pelleting directly inside the body

1056
01:04:43,740 --> 01:04:48,830
smaller separation but it's still there
arm

1057
01:04:48,830 --> 01:04:52,830
baited yeah I did one of the things that
is

1058
01:04:52,830 --> 01:04:58,620
arm vaguely positive about having
depression is that you do get a lot of

1059
01:04:58,620 --> 01:05:00,029
time to think

1060
01:05:00,029 --> 01:05:04,220
when you allow yourself to you because
when I get too far down into a disk and

1061
01:05:04,220 --> 01:05:05,029
only in bed

1062
01:05:05,029 --> 01:05:08,750
and I don't even bother with turning on
my computer to you

1063
01:05:08,750 --> 01:05:11,970
13 kinda video gamer mom

1064
01:05:11,970 --> 01:05:15,480
TV show or anything like that a disk and
weekly there and think and every time

1065
01:05:15,480 --> 01:05:16,650
I'm there

1066
01:05:16,650 --> 01:05:19,890
I learned significant in profound things
about myself

1067
01:05:19,890 --> 01:05:23,339
and common constantly in a steep
learning

1068
01:05:23,339 --> 01:05:27,080
what makes me depressed nyaa get there
and why

1069
01:05:27,080 --> 01:05:31,130
feel the separations love arm myself

1070
01:05:31,130 --> 01:05:35,120
from everything external and arm

1071
01:05:35,120 --> 01:05:39,830
you know as much said like you know he's
you can really change in you the stuff

1072
01:05:39,830 --> 01:05:40,770
that's out there in

1073
01:05:40,770 --> 01:05:45,160
unless you can only make some the set
the cambodians slick

1074
01:05:45,160 --> 01:05:49,250
you never know like how arm how well one
thing is gonna do your Howell and other

1075
01:05:49,250 --> 01:05:50,190
things continue

1076
01:05:50,190 --> 01:05:53,580
arm and yet so

1077
01:05:53,580 --> 01:05:58,220
a guess the timing a constant state of
learning on and every time I go into a

1078
01:05:58,220 --> 01:06:00,609
significant depression and come back out

1079
01:06:00,609 --> 01:06:04,420
understanding why let me into it now
they don't let it happen again

1080
01:06:04,420 --> 01:06:08,529
so arm or at least a train out to you
I'm oftentimes it's

1081
01:06:08,529 --> 01:06:12,540
no external things you can't do anything
about that arm

1082
01:06:12,540 --> 01:06:15,750
%um

1083
01:06:15,750 --> 01:06:20,180
snow when I was percent during the
hacker seen

1084
01:06:20,180 --> 01:06:25,140
mom I A was unfamiliar with him handles

1085
01:06:25,140 --> 01:06:29,500
up until that point and I just picked a
name

1086
01:06:29,500 --> 01:06:33,529
in became somebody else in her bed

1087
01:06:33,529 --> 01:06:36,759
and that was the first time that day

1088
01:06:36,759 --> 01:06:40,020
was able to you split

1089
01:06:40,020 --> 01:06:44,890
myself into two separate identities and
one of those identities

1090
01:06:44,890 --> 01:06:48,230
words going in doing things

1091
01:06:48,230 --> 01:06:51,850
and interacting with people and gaining

1092
01:06:51,850 --> 01:06:55,210
value home and the other one

1093
01:06:55,210 --> 01:07:00,609
was person aid also been up to that
point it was just very depressed

1094
01:07:00,609 --> 01:07:04,930
and he didn't selves and had no

1095
01:07:04,930 --> 01:07:09,259
internal sensor values overall while I
became this other person this hacker

1096
01:07:09,259 --> 01:07:09,980
handle

1097
01:07:09,980 --> 01:07:14,299
persona and it wasn't

1098
01:07:14,299 --> 01:07:17,460
he you will little dissociated

1099
01:07:17,460 --> 01:07:21,250
but I was just able to step into being
this other person for a while

1100
01:07:21,250 --> 01:07:25,500
and to build value as that person and

1101
01:07:25,500 --> 01:07:28,850
after a while I realize that there is
another split

1102
01:07:28,850 --> 01:07:32,109
that had occurred bed internally there
is a third

1103
01:07:32,109 --> 01:07:35,420
person quote-unquote that I was being

1104
01:07:35,420 --> 01:07:39,480
that was holding all the pain that I was
feeling that I couldn't really deal with

1105
01:07:39,480 --> 01:07:41,040
at the time

1106
01:07:41,040 --> 01:07:44,330
and I

1107
01:07:44,330 --> 01:07:47,290
realized this after a few years to being
in hacker seen that there's actually

1108
01:07:47,290 --> 01:07:48,980
three different people

1109
01:07:48,980 --> 01:07:53,540
and for some reason I said to myself oh
god that's not good I don't want to be

1110
01:07:53,540 --> 01:07:57,150
the three different people Nico that
multiple personalities whatever

1111
01:07:57,150 --> 01:08:01,470
this is bad and I tried to you
reintegrate

1112
01:08:01,470 --> 01:08:08,359
all these separate identities into one
and that was it terrible terrible idea

1113
01:08:08,359 --> 01:08:12,710
arm because you reintroduced the pain

1114
01:08:12,710 --> 01:08:16,439
that I was feeling a lack a value in
myself that I perceived

1115
01:08:16,440 --> 01:08:20,200
to an identity that had been building
value: with which was

1116
01:08:20,200 --> 01:08:24,839
and had great energy that I was using
and you pretty much took me down

1117
01:08:24,839 --> 01:08:29,630
and I stopped being social Nick and
became a hermit for a very long time in

1118
01:08:29,630 --> 01:08:33,670
then went into my downward spiral which
might mean leaving

1119
01:08:33,670 --> 01:08:38,389
New York an almost deciding to kill
myself

1120
01:08:38,389 --> 01:08:41,400
and after I've started coming out all
that

1121
01:08:41,400 --> 01:08:44,490
I hate you thought about on

1122
01:08:44,490 --> 01:08:49,019
this this separation identity in like
the Moors thing was starting to go on as

1123
01:08:49,020 --> 01:08:50,389
well

1124
01:08:50,389 --> 01:08:54,560
and Blake your real name versus you are
on the Internet

1125
01:08:54,560 --> 01:08:58,700
and I started thinking about this in the
context I'll on home

1126
01:08:58,700 --> 01:09:02,799
like self-image and PTSD in who you are
in fact that

1127
01:09:02,799 --> 01:09:06,019
home if your internal

1128
01:09:06,020 --> 01:09:09,620
cell images still still broken

1129
01:09:09,620 --> 01:09:14,950
then having another identity that you
can be even step into

1130
01:09:14,950 --> 01:09:19,420
and had value to you draw on and
eventually become

1131
01:09:19,420 --> 01:09:24,609
in some more constructive way could
actually be a really good thing

1132
01:09:24,609 --> 01:09:29,049
and in culture in our culture specially
old cultures and tribal cultures

1133
01:09:29,049 --> 01:09:32,660
arm you weren't just yourself but you
were aspects

1134
01:09:32,660 --> 01:09:36,950
I'll other things that were lakini to
your culture like

1135
01:09:36,950 --> 01:09:41,740
on DD manifestations or your ancestors
and things like that new with the three

1136
01:09:41,740 --> 01:09:43,630
things that you could put on

1137
01:09:43,630 --> 01:09:47,880
when you need it draw on me the positive
attributes have whatever it was and I

1138
01:09:47,880 --> 01:09:48,350
thought

1139
01:09:48,350 --> 01:09:54,310
why can't we do this with identities
that we create intake on shelves

1140
01:09:54,310 --> 01:10:00,130
that if we r person home with a neat
little we ballin hacker community we're

1141
01:10:00,130 --> 01:10:04,560
doing good things but over here
someplace else we feel bad

1142
01:10:04,560 --> 01:10:10,270
that okay it okay to be two different
people for as long as useful for you

1143
01:10:10,270 --> 01:10:16,900
and home for a while was for use with
still useful for me you can take on

1144
01:10:16,900 --> 01:10:21,260
a lot more as a person if you have
different identities to be at different

1145
01:10:21,260 --> 01:10:22,370
times

1146
01:10:22,370 --> 01:10:26,570
that don't run over each other trip over
each other causes complex damage was

1147
01:10:26,570 --> 01:10:27,960
talking about

1148
01:10:27,960 --> 01:10:32,179
and you can still be yourself as well
cuz I think there's a there's a little

1149
01:10:32,179 --> 01:10:35,690
bit of a stigma with like being
different people right now

1150
01:10:35,690 --> 01:10:38,900
anything that's also more negative than
in

1151
01:10:38,900 --> 01:10:44,490
then it really has to be mom

1152
01:10:44,490 --> 01:10:48,630
sherry L I could be being somebody else
for a while

1153
01:10:48,630 --> 01:10:51,820
is helping me become more the person

1154
01:10:51,820 --> 01:10:56,150
eventually want to be no matter how many
manifestations

1155
01:10:56,150 --> 01:11:01,809
get into bean I am one physical person
with one

1156
01:11:01,810 --> 01:11:04,810
set have chemical reactions that's going
on

1157
01:11:04,810 --> 01:11:10,290
but I can shape those to manifest
differently at different times

1158
01:11:10,290 --> 01:11:15,100
on yeah

1159
01:11:15,100 --> 01:11:19,290
I was talking earlier about that you
know that accomplishment driven

1160
01:11:19,290 --> 01:11:22,800
sense itself and I think the point

1161
01:11:22,800 --> 01:11:26,550
where that becomes paralyzing is

1162
01:11:26,550 --> 01:11:29,790
when it becomes a fear failure

1163
01:11:29,790 --> 01:11:33,389
and you're in an academic environment
especially you know where you're under a

1164
01:11:33,389 --> 01:11:36,070
lot of pressure to produce results

1165
01:11:36,070 --> 01:11:40,580
arm you know you can you can just get
overwhelming

1166
01:11:40,580 --> 01:11:43,750
you know because when you're when you're
under all this pressure

1167
01:11:43,750 --> 01:11:48,540
to site engine actually want one big
problem I have with academia thats

1168
01:11:48,540 --> 01:11:49,200
actually I think

1169
01:11:49,200 --> 01:11:52,769
massive problem hacker seen is that
we're a lot cooler with negative results

1170
01:11:52,770 --> 01:11:54,380
like it if it turns out that

1171
01:11:54,380 --> 01:11:58,160
X doesn't work that's actually
interesting I

1172
01:11:58,160 --> 01:12:01,730
and so you know it was I can I came out
of an academic background and didn't

1173
01:12:01,730 --> 01:12:06,200
really get involved in the hacker
community until about 2005 2006

1174
01:12:06,200 --> 01:12:09,670
arm and it was I guess around that time

1175
01:12:09,670 --> 01:12:13,830
they I i consciously made the decision

1176
01:12:13,830 --> 01:12:17,860
date I just wasn't gonna be afraid to be
wrong in public anymore

1177
01:12:17,860 --> 01:12:22,059
I am you know it Kors if I failed at ten
different things this week

1178
01:12:22,060 --> 01:12:26,530
I mean I tried ten different things this
week I you know if it turns out the

1179
01:12:26,530 --> 01:12:29,870
to end it if it turns out that like to
love them or actually straight-up

1180
01:12:29,870 --> 01:12:30,880
impossible

1181
01:12:30,880 --> 01:12:33,990
that's good to know that's not

1182
01:12:33,990 --> 01:12:39,450
arm so you know it's again I think just
love it has to it has to do with

1183
01:12:39,450 --> 01:12:42,540
with the environments you know that that
you're in

1184
01:12:42,540 --> 01:12:46,480
you know if you're if you're constantly
being pressured to produce

1185
01:12:46,480 --> 01:12:50,550
and that and that's hurting you you need
to get the hell out that

1186
01:12:50,550 --> 01:12:53,700
farm nom and find someplace

1187
01:12:53,700 --> 01:12:57,360
dates more supportive love as

1188
01:12:57,360 --> 01:13:00,429
trying and failing I am

1189
01:13:00,429 --> 01:13:03,690
and I can be hard to do I mean cuz if
you're you know if

1190
01:13:03,690 --> 01:13:07,760
if if you're stuck in a job the urine
and can't find another one

1191
01:13:07,760 --> 01:13:12,650
you know its dats that's not something
to feel guilty about

1192
01:13:12,650 --> 01:13:18,490
by the nice thing about having other
communities to be partnered is that you

1193
01:13:18,490 --> 01:13:19,559
can find one

1194
01:13:19,560 --> 01:13:23,780
that's the others more tolerant arm

1195
01:13:23,780 --> 01:13:30,030
%uh not not necessarily producing near
the positive result

1196
01:13:30,030 --> 01:13:34,849
so it's about not quite 20 after four
and I'm wondering if you would

1197
01:13:34,850 --> 01:13:37,639
I know that we have we could keep
talking about this for a long time I

1198
01:13:37,639 --> 01:13:38,690
wonder if you

1199
01:13:38,690 --> 01:13:42,550
are ready for about 10 minutes %uh
audience questions

1200
01:13:42,550 --> 01:13:49,550
and then we can come back up to the
panel for a last word

1201
01:13:51,560 --> 01:13:54,469
okay thank you about five minutes and I
ask questions if the house lights could

1202
01:13:54,469 --> 01:14:01,469
come up please

1203
01:14:03,530 --> 01:14:07,679
just wanted ads at a couple thoughts one
statement I feel like I've dealt with a

1204
01:14:07,680 --> 01:14:09,600
lot of people i've seen. dealing with
this

1205
01:14:09,600 --> 01:14:13,080
that was the idea that therapy was
somehow because it was doctor because

1206
01:14:13,080 --> 01:14:14,269
your brain was sick

1207
01:14:14,270 --> 01:14:18,480
and that in went there in here how
therapy talks about itself like in

1208
01:14:18,480 --> 01:14:19,170
academia

1209
01:14:19,170 --> 01:14:22,510
that's not really what goes on it's more
about the discussion and it's more like

1210
01:14:22,510 --> 01:14:25,530
having a friend took me awhile to get to
that point on

1211
01:14:25,530 --> 01:14:29,280
and as they also serve rethink what
their abuse going to be about like I

1212
01:14:29,280 --> 01:14:31,950
went in front on in like it up but my
parents and everything

1213
01:14:31,950 --> 01:14:36,590
was crappy that way and then a couple
years ago I started talking about my job

1214
01:14:36,590 --> 01:14:39,690
and suddenly there's this entire other
world

1215
01:14:39,690 --> 01:14:43,160
things to think about some maybe can all
put aside this idea that like

1216
01:14:43,160 --> 01:14:46,960
the shrink is for your broken head it's
not fair broken head is just wait up his

1217
01:14:46,960 --> 01:14:47,320
things

1218
01:14:47,320 --> 01:14:50,639
another thing a woman can we as a
culture is geeks

1219
01:14:50,640 --> 01:14:55,570
can we think about I I was lucky when I
was 12 to find a group of friends who

1220
01:14:55,570 --> 01:15:01,030
arm were a regular now sort of the thing
that held us together and do his work

1221
01:15:01,030 --> 01:15:02,460
and have that be what we're about

1222
01:15:02,460 --> 01:15:06,140
is accepting regularly accepting flaws
in strangeness

1223
01:15:06,140 --> 01:15:09,700
because on I

1224
01:15:09,700 --> 01:15:14,620
yeah on agreement because if we if we
make it about who is the most you the

1225
01:15:14,620 --> 01:15:18,040
hacker if we make it about who is not
hardcore busting up and working really

1226
01:15:18,040 --> 01:15:18,540
hard

1227
01:15:18,540 --> 01:15:22,150
we begin to parcels in dry so and I feel
like if we attackers

1228
01:15:22,150 --> 01:15:25,640
we say was fined a strange things and we
have more routes for creativity

1229
01:15:25,640 --> 01:15:29,570
seles think that I'd like to speak to
that actually and Kors

1230
01:15:29,570 --> 01:15:34,389
I I was actually not diagnosed as being
on the spectrum until Aug just before I

1231
01:15:34,390 --> 01:15:35,690
left for graduate school

1232
01:15:35,690 --> 01:15:40,230
I and I didn't really start a.m. seeing
a therapist

1233
01:15:40,230 --> 01:15:43,270
add to help me deal with lecture the
social problems that that

1234
01:15:43,270 --> 01:15:47,140
that brought on for me until I was
actually like well into my

1235
01:15:47,140 --> 01:15:50,150
into the PhD I ended up dropping out and

1236
01:15:50,150 --> 01:15:54,730
really you know the I think the most
useful thing that I got out alive

1237
01:15:54,730 --> 01:15:58,460
aromatherapy was on you know

1238
01:15:58,460 --> 01:16:01,550
might my therapist helped me

1239
01:16:01,550 --> 01:16:05,140
come up with ways to you communicated to

1240
01:16:05,140 --> 01:16:08,860
other people you know the

1241
01:16:08,860 --> 01:16:13,280
look this is this is just how I am there
is not something wrong about the fact

1242
01:16:13,280 --> 01:16:17,230
that i'm looking you in the nostrils and
not the eye when I'm talking to you

1243
01:16:17,230 --> 01:16:20,430
the oh there's not something wrong about
the fact day

1244
01:16:20,430 --> 01:16:23,780
I have a flat affect all the time
there's not something wrong about me all

1245
01:16:23,780 --> 01:16:24,400
these other

1246
01:16:24,400 --> 01:16:28,060
like you know quirky past behaviors I
have arm

1247
01:16:28,060 --> 01:16:30,990
you know there's not something wrong
about the fact that I really am just

1248
01:16:30,990 --> 01:16:32,510
going to take you literally

1249
01:16:32,510 --> 01:16:37,260
and and you know it was it was it was it
was hard at first

1250
01:16:37,260 --> 01:16:40,490
to you know feel comfortable you know

1251
01:16:40,490 --> 01:16:43,670
presenting that to people

1252
01:16:43,670 --> 01:16:48,820
by you know really just you know with
with time a disregard easier to live in

1253
01:16:48,820 --> 01:16:50,049
my own skin

1254
01:16:50,050 --> 01:16:53,300
and and that was really the the
beneficial thing I got

1255
01:16:53,300 --> 01:16:56,740
outta you know a lot about that
experience with my therapist in Isla

1256
01:16:56,740 --> 01:17:00,679
sale with about two and a half minutes
later five minutes after sorry

1257
01:17:00,680 --> 01:17:05,070
okay adding to the target server

1258
01:17:05,070 --> 01:17:08,380
through the great so I have put on
medication

1259
01:17:08,380 --> 01:17:13,030
and I wonder when when you decide to go
on or off medication what are some the

1260
01:17:13,030 --> 01:17:13,860
alternatives

1261
01:17:13,860 --> 01:17:17,540
in specifically any experience with the
medication I'm

1262
01:17:17,540 --> 01:17:20,730
traditionally creativity in productivity
any

1263
01:17:20,730 --> 01:17:26,870
pros cons stop and so I i've been on in
of medications for a long time and

1264
01:17:26,870 --> 01:17:27,620
currently

1265
01:17:27,620 --> 01:17:32,420
not on medication and and I would have
been on medication if I would have been

1266
01:17:32,420 --> 01:17:34,950
in a single area or a

1267
01:17:34,950 --> 01:17:39,790
long enough to do that I'm currently
nomadic so it's been kinda difficult

1268
01:17:39,790 --> 01:17:45,850
arm it depends on the kinda medication
you're on the they are kinda picky

1269
01:17:45,850 --> 01:17:47,310
differently and it had

1270
01:17:47,310 --> 01:17:50,980
very negative reactions to some and
pretty positive reactions to others

1271
01:17:50,980 --> 01:17:55,580
on but I basically gone medication when
I feel that they needed and usually when

1272
01:17:55,580 --> 01:17:56,740
I need it is when a

1273
01:17:56,740 --> 01:18:01,080
able to deal with the stuff myself and
I'm not dealing with the stuff myself

1274
01:18:01,080 --> 01:18:05,809
am it up when they need help in general
I'm so that's one is 13

1275
01:18:05,810 --> 01:18:08,890
therapists and a get on medication and
it takes the edge off

1276
01:18:08,890 --> 01:18:12,130
um in creativity ways

1277
01:18:12,130 --> 01:18:15,470
a and I i founded in effect um

1278
01:18:15,470 --> 01:18:19,980
a little bit but it sorta Blake all the
edges get rounded off

1279
01:18:19,980 --> 01:18:24,370
instead a t-shirt appointees can have
linked dole ones to go a little bit less

1280
01:18:24,370 --> 01:18:25,809
higher last slow

1281
01:18:25,810 --> 01:18:31,510
mom by caveat on the going on and off
meds thing that can work with depression

1282
01:18:31,510 --> 01:18:33,610
it absolutely does not work with
schizophrenia

1283
01:18:33,610 --> 01:18:37,559
yeah %um

1284
01:18:37,560 --> 01:18:41,280
so my question was very much similar to
that

1285
01:18:41,280 --> 01:18:44,429
I'm so all the other common I had about
that

1286
01:18:44,430 --> 01:18:47,750
observations the trends -ism so

1287
01:18:47,750 --> 01:18:52,480
actually didn't realize a spittle people
getting prescribed medication but non

1288
01:18:52,480 --> 01:18:55,690
seeking treatment doing talk p

1289
01:18:55,690 --> 01:18:59,620
which I terrible idea yeah yeah

1290
01:18:59,620 --> 01:19:03,059
which to come pretty shocking because 1
the

1291
01:19:03,060 --> 01:19:06,560
I mean where the first things I was
diagnosed with depression

1292
01:19:06,560 --> 01:19:09,970
when I was like 17 years thing home and

1293
01:19:09,970 --> 01:19:13,490
but I was seeing someone but also
medication that was on often

1294
01:19:13,490 --> 01:19:16,860
that's been working but I I would never
think to do that

1295
01:19:16,860 --> 01:19:20,589
without seeing someone's this is its
yeah shocking to me

1296
01:19:20,590 --> 01:19:24,580
and keep in mind arm if your part
prescribed medication

1297
01:19:24,580 --> 01:19:27,350
in you wanted to talk therapy you're
probably going to have to have a

1298
01:19:27,350 --> 01:19:29,440
different therapist for the talk therapy

1299
01:19:29,440 --> 01:19:32,880
the psychiatrist is there to prescribe
the medication make sure that it's

1300
01:19:32,880 --> 01:19:34,350
working appropriately

1301
01:19:34,350 --> 01:19:39,290
by he's usually that that person is not
going to be

1302
01:19:39,290 --> 01:19:43,470
really somebody that you can go and talk
to every week you should have another

1303
01:19:43,470 --> 01:19:48,230
specific talk therapist for that as well
I have a talk therapist and psychiatrist

1304
01:19:48,230 --> 01:19:49,150
right now

1305
01:19:49,150 --> 01:19:53,080
in and make sure both for them and other
people in your life who are smoothly

1306
01:19:53,080 --> 01:19:55,220
there to help you or people you relate

1307
01:19:55,220 --> 01:19:58,810
to and you know in here good they are on
your side

1308
01:19:58,810 --> 01:20:02,700
and if they're not yet don't be afraid
to shop around caters to the luxury

1309
01:20:02,700 --> 01:20:09,260
liner Ireland as love you dearly fire
doctors if they don't work

1310
01:20:09,260 --> 01:20:12,610
yeah that's on

1311
01:20:12,610 --> 01:20:16,190
AI a brought this up really early the
medication by itself will do you

1312
01:20:16,190 --> 01:20:17,410
absolutely

1313
01:20:17,410 --> 01:20:20,800
nothing arm unless you

1314
01:20:20,800 --> 01:20:24,850
have some way of working through it so
here in the put your mind in a chemical

1315
01:20:24,850 --> 01:20:25,850
state where it

1316
01:20:25,850 --> 01:20:29,470
easier for you to get to the state that
you want to be in but it's not gonna do

1317
01:20:29,470 --> 01:20:30,260
by yourself

1318
01:20:30,260 --> 01:20:34,230
you still have to you also be doing the
work doing the talking

1319
01:20:34,230 --> 01:20:37,580
doing thinking yup it is kinda Blake

1320
01:20:37,580 --> 01:20:41,750
keeps that anxiety point for being so
sharp so I can actually get up

1321
01:20:41,750 --> 01:20:45,170
and take the garbage out work lost my
key or

1322
01:20:45,170 --> 01:20:49,120
answers in emails it's not an arm I
think that this is going to magically

1323
01:20:49,120 --> 01:20:50,490
fix everything because

1324
01:20:50,490 --> 01:20:53,969
you know that that's you don't fix

1325
01:20:53,970 --> 01:20:57,480
these things you're not broken it is
something you need to Lake

1326
01:20:57,480 --> 01:21:01,910
learn about and be at that their piss

1327
01:21:01,910 --> 01:21:07,370
I thats it's just find a therapist that
you are comfortable talking to you and

1328
01:21:07,370 --> 01:21:09,140
you feel better about

1329
01:21:09,140 --> 01:21:12,670
when you see them that's I mean that's a
significant point isley

1330
01:21:12,670 --> 01:21:16,400
if you feel like shit every single time
you go to your therapist find a new

1331
01:21:16,400 --> 01:21:17,880
fucking their best

1332
01:21:17,880 --> 01:21:21,030
arm so its

1333
01:21:21,030 --> 01:21:24,290
okay to feel like shit occasionally when
you've talked about some

1334
01:21:24,290 --> 01:21:28,600
huge thing you're gonna feel crappy for
probably weeks afterwards but then

1335
01:21:28,600 --> 01:21:32,230
eventually feel this huge relief like
wow I can't believe I was like holding

1336
01:21:32,230 --> 01:21:33,600
on to that leak

1337
01:21:33,600 --> 01:21:37,750
some we've been given the two-minute
warning a.m. so you can just offer quick

1338
01:21:37,750 --> 01:21:38,520
metaphor

1339
01:21:38,520 --> 01:21:41,890
and medication can be a great soldering
iron be you have to be the rewiring

1340
01:21:41,890 --> 01:21:44,160
yourself

1341
01:21:44,160 --> 01:21:48,680
so can we do one more question and come
back to the last word on the panel

1342
01:21:48,680 --> 01:21:53,650
thank you I'll try future humpers I want
to apply the panel for the courage to

1343
01:21:53,650 --> 01:21:54,560
put it together

1344
01:21:54,560 --> 01:21:57,840
and at the ritz

1345
01:21:57,840 --> 01:22:01,410
the boys we talked about how often it
takes a lot of cards to stay alive and

1346
01:22:01,410 --> 01:22:03,260
not everybody realizes that's a choice

1347
01:22:03,260 --> 01:22:06,690
i really wanna invite everyone in the
audience if they're not familiar

1348
01:22:06,690 --> 01:22:10,380
with the new wave %uh radical man on how
there's a lot of groups out there like

1349
01:22:10,380 --> 01:22:11,710
the acres project

1350
01:22:11,710 --> 01:22:15,800
who are all about china change the
language used to describe mental illness

1351
01:22:15,800 --> 01:22:18,240
and talk about it more in terms of
dangerous gives angry

1352
01:22:18,240 --> 01:22:22,120
saber spaces like bees to share to share
subject narratives

1353
01:22:22,120 --> 01:22:26,030
arm Adelia time to really engage in some
other questions around languages and

1354
01:22:26,030 --> 01:22:27,160
compassion I think

1355
01:22:27,160 --> 01:22:30,550
most reviews book from the eye which is
incredible and start with stories but

1356
01:22:30,550 --> 01:22:34,780
we are operating in this context where
I'm the psychiatric establishment and

1357
01:22:34,780 --> 01:22:37,460
the pharmaceutical complex can be
critiqued outsider

1358
01:22:37,460 --> 01:22:41,610
informed consent and so people should
really understand I think that I am

1359
01:22:41,610 --> 01:22:44,650
others been a movie on the dogmatic

1360
01:22:44,650 --> 01:22:48,350
and I psychiatry which is black or white
magic nomads and towards a much more

1361
01:22:48,350 --> 01:22:49,680
nuance critique

1362
01:22:49,680 --> 01:22:53,640
I'll psychiatry in pharma and to that
point it was time I was curious if

1363
01:22:53,640 --> 01:22:55,120
people on the PowerBar

1364
01:22:55,120 --> 01:22:58,769
the anything ought to be stigmatized so

swallow

1368
01:23:06,900 --> 01:23:10,290
the notion that you're sick there is no
cure need to be on drugs the rest your

1369
01:23:10,290 --> 01:23:11,390
life so
