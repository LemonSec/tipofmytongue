1
00:00:00,089 --> 00:00:03,939
thank you for waking up early after a
night about re here and help

2
00:00:03,939 --> 00:00:07,230
I am like to think the previous speaker
for me i dnt up

3
00:00:07,230 --> 00:00:12,050
Havas very enlightening I want to give
you a heads up ahead of time

4
00:00:12,050 --> 00:00:15,230
if you're a super advance elite hacker
as all of us are

5
00:00:15,230 --> 00:00:18,430
you're prolly gonna hide a lot of the
stock to be extremely basic

6
00:00:18,430 --> 00:00:21,480
so hopefully I'll stick around to the
jokes but

7
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:25,990
feel just excuse my lack of sleep
medicine this

8
00:00:25,990 --> 00:00:29,510
I so %um the background on me

9
00:00:29,510 --> 00:00:32,640
I'm been can be I unwired been on
Twitter

10
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:36,700
my current job is working on JavaScript
frameworks for the company formerly

11
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:37,710
known as Paul

12
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:42,110
currently known as some sorcery RHP
nothing I'm talking about today is

13
00:00:42,110 --> 00:00:43,300
speaking on behalf

14
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:46,910
or in favor of my employer cell just
ignore all that

15
00:00:46,910 --> 00:00:51,190
I I do like my employer that by the way

16
00:00:51,190 --> 00:00:54,218
just yet not speaking for them I am

17
00:00:54,219 --> 00:00:57,969
in my past life I was your browser
developer at Mozilla

18
00:00:57,969 --> 00:01:02,340
and I worked on mobile devices and
compilers and developer tools so

19
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:06,520
a spokesman lot of time thinking about
how people develop applications

20
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:09,520
and in this case holder developing for
the web

21
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:12,960
and what that means for all the web
users out there and how you can find out

22
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:13,970
what you're actually doing

23
00:01:13,970 --> 00:01:18,729
so I thought what I do is I take you
through for different examples

24
00:01:18,729 --> 00:01:21,740
looking up take a web sites or
applications and then looking at

25
00:01:21,740 --> 00:01:25,759
what tools you can use to figure out
what they're really doing so

26
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:29,560
Center in New York my first example is
going to be the New York Times

27
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:33,850
New York Times no very popular website

28
00:01:33,850 --> 00:01:37,979
millions in million to hit today let's
see what's really going on you load a

29
00:01:37,979 --> 00:01:38,548
page

30
00:01:38,549 --> 00:01:43,490
so I'm gonna do it I'm going to have
over to my Google Chrome here

31
00:01:43,490 --> 00:01:47,360
showing just a New York Times web page
over this morning

32
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:51,600
I now Google Chrome

33
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:55,549
for the last five or six releases which
probably I think means about three weeks

34
00:01:55,549 --> 00:01:56,009
now

35
00:01:56,009 --> 00:02:00,750
I has been shipping developer tools
built into it that are really quite nice

36
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:04,170
the usual way you activated you go to
the menu bar

37
00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:07,530
and sure in the Mac you go to view
developer

38
00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:12,400
developer tools this either brings up a
separate window

39
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:16,080
or if you go down here to the very
bottom and uses special

40
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:20,629
doing technique moon click their

41
00:02:20,629 --> 00:02:24,239
and then come back out its top to the
bottom of the page

42
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:28,170
so yet kinda easy convenient way to get
there

43
00:02:28,170 --> 00:02:33,500
but for purses undocking beautiful thing
to the developer tools let you do things

44
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:33,870
like

45
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:37,780
look at the actual HTML text and it
kinda shows it in this

46
00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:41,720
clapped for me you can't dig into it but
not see everything at once

47
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:44,739
and let you look at all the resources is
basically

48
00:02:44,739 --> 00:02:48,500
all up the pieces the page so in this
case we have one frame

49
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:53,900
and we have maybe some database
associated with it or index TV tables

50
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:57,819
cookies but keeping your look at yours
network

51
00:02:57,819 --> 00:03:01,180
so what does this network captive well

52
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:04,230
whenever rigby whenever you load a
webpage

53
00:03:04,230 --> 00:03:09,149
you don't just load a single HTML file
that HTML file links to lots where the

54
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:10,060
resources

55
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:14,230
whether they be images scripts flash
movies

56
00:03:14,230 --> 00:03:18,420
I sound files all sorts the stocks so

57
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:22,090
Dish Network tab is going to show you
every single

58
00:03:22,090 --> 00:03:25,739
each EP transaction that webpage make
says you're loading an even at its

59
00:03:25,739 --> 00:03:28,819
running in your browser to goes on so

60
00:03:28,819 --> 00:03:32,220
we brought this up after we already
loaded the new york times page or

61
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:33,700
noticing a few things here

62
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:39,760
we're noticing this reference to pay
certain HEB parlance initially be

63
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:42,980
get is just a simple request to the
server to send back a resource

64
00:03:42,980 --> 00:03:46,769
I a GV also does post we're sending
information to the server

65
00:03:46,769 --> 00:03:50,799
and then it supports methods like puttin
delete that are mainly used by web geek

66
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:52,629
said like to write applications in a

67
00:03:52,629 --> 00:03:55,980
restful way um so

68
00:03:55,980 --> 00:03:59,340
just sitting here on the page it
actually continually going and picking

69
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:02,530
something called static char P dot com

70
00:04:02,530 --> 00:04:05,700
10 that statute pinging at its pinging

71
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:10,409
a really help you you're all here so
looking at this URL

72
00:04:10,409 --> 00:04:13,510
first things we can notice is that
there's a lot of information in this

73
00:04:13,510 --> 00:04:17,889
even though it's requesting just a
single pic image it actually sending

74
00:04:17,889 --> 00:04:21,359
a huge man fell about what's going on in
that webpage what's going on your

75
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:22,008
browser

76
00:04:22,009 --> 00:04:26,180
I'll yasser services here which is

77
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:31,130
looks like that's going to to mobile dot
com not quite sure who that is

78
00:04:31,130 --> 00:04:33,990
was going to reload the New York Times
web page and see all the things that

79
00:04:33,990 --> 00:04:34,860
look

80
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:39,800
so actually we can to command are from
this or can also do it from developer

81
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:42,320
tools

82
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:48,130
so it's gonna go and some really showing
us justice huge number resources loaded

83
00:04:48,130 --> 00:04:51,280
I at a time goes on

84
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:56,169
you're the very bottom of the screen
seamen on that

85
00:04:56,169 --> 00:05:00,008
we see there's a hundred 81 separate
request being made

86
00:05:00,009 --> 00:05:03,900
also the different services just a
little New York Times web page

87
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:07,220
all in all it's about 164 came with the
data

88
00:05:07,220 --> 00:05:10,610
I up to this point takin 18 seconds to
load all

89
00:05:10,610 --> 00:05:14,639
this and this on low numbers basically
how much time it takes to get to the

90
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:17,500
point where the web browser thinks a
page is actually loaded

91
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:20,740
and its top showing that circle moving
animation

92
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:23,910
and you you can't get the exit

93
00:05:23,910 --> 00:05:28,310
so what kinda stuff is loaded urinal New
York Times site

94
00:05:28,310 --> 00:05:32,180
to go to the very top we have a course
in New York Times web page

95
00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:35,900
if we click on that your developer tools
it actually shows us

96
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:39,240
HTTP header is that have been sent by
the browser

97
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:42,970
and all the responses to come back so

98
00:05:42,970 --> 00:05:46,120
those Harris paying for the most part a
really boring stuff

99
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:50,880
and saying hey I'm a web browser I can
accept some HTML text I can accept some

100
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:55,740
XML text or you all these other things
hey I happen to like English a lot

101
00:05:55,740 --> 00:05:59,590
and things like that kinda most useful
for understanding

102
00:05:59,590 --> 00:06:03,910
though this interaction between the web
browser on the website archives

103
00:06:03,910 --> 00:06:07,600
so role familiar with the idea that
cookies are data gets sent from web

104
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,860
servers and get stored in your browser

105
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:13,280
for some period of time and whenever a
cookie is a socially with a particular

106
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:14,289
domain

107
00:06:14,289 --> 00:06:18,270
any request today domain is going to
send a cookie along with it

108
00:06:18,270 --> 00:06:21,409
now fortunately chrome gives is kinda be

109
00:06:21,410 --> 00:06:24,690
view that decode to speak cookie
blocking shows all the details

110
00:06:24,690 --> 00:06:28,240
it so a lot of the cookies are

111
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:32,520
really more I mean the most common use
cookies is what's called session cookies

112
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:36,229
the idea is that when you go and login
or start a website

113
00:06:36,229 --> 00:06:39,780
transaction the server sends down some

114
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:43,860
unique random string that identifies
your particular session up talking to

115
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:45,000
that server

116
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,600
and so you can do things like safe state
on your behalf

117
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:51,680
all that but then there are cookies
which are tracking cookies

118
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:55,550
I wants to look for all these are these
one starting with UT

119
00:06:55,550 --> 00:07:00,150
underscore UT so to explain what those
are I'm gonna switch over to a different

120
00:07:00,150 --> 00:07:01,500
web browser

121
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:07,599
and this is a page on Google site about
product called Google Analytics

122
00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:11,530
I would say well over half the web right
now is using some form a Google

123
00:07:11,530 --> 00:07:15,370
Analytics which basically puts a very
small script on your page

124
00:07:15,370 --> 00:07:20,220
whenever that page loads up its gonna go
and request a few files from Google

125
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:24,039
and that let schools track your movement
across the web

126
00:07:24,039 --> 00:07:28,568
I fortunately Google you know does try
to be a little more transparent a lot of

127
00:07:28,569 --> 00:07:31,349
people so they have this whole website
set up telling you

128
00:07:31,349 --> 00:07:35,530
what these cookies are what they do even
with the cooking

129
00:07:35,530 --> 00:07:38,789
so if you want to find out more about
what these are you can go there

130
00:07:38,789 --> 00:07:42,229
I if your browser is set to block
third-party cookies

131
00:07:42,229 --> 00:07:46,680
summit this data gets blocked but not
all of it if we go back over to

132
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:50,949
chrome will notice that this cookie is
set on the New York Times web page

133
00:07:50,949 --> 00:07:55,250
not on Google site that means that that
could he wouldn't be blocked by turning

134
00:07:55,250 --> 00:07:56,750
off third party cookies

135
00:07:56,750 --> 00:08:01,039
it probably would be blocked by turning
off JavaScript but

136
00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:05,240
now that's something which is common
practice to do on the web today

137
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:08,560
okay so back to the headers I

138
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:12,280
another useful header that gets set with
every your questions or for

139
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:17,160
annexed telling their website what site
you are looking at when you went to that

140
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:21,610
I usually if you type your URL into the
address part doesn't set refer

141
00:08:21,610 --> 00:08:25,770
but if you click on a link or hit
refresh Daniel tell that site where you

142
00:08:25,770 --> 00:08:29,539
came from unless you have some extension
to turn offers

143
00:08:29,539 --> 00:08:34,000
and then we also have user-agent: so
pretty much every browser filled out

144
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,099
there has a unique user agent string

145
00:08:36,099 --> 00:08:41,979
and this string is kind of a giant pile
of debris to lead over time

146
00:08:41,979 --> 00:08:45,149
you notice we're using Chrome but the
very first thing it says is hey we're

147
00:08:45,149 --> 00:08:47,779
using Mozilla version 5

148
00:08:47,779 --> 00:08:52,370
this is basically because a lot of web
sites to a lot of stupid things about

149
00:08:52,370 --> 00:08:56,410
holding a tactical versions and

150
00:08:56,410 --> 00:08:59,480
a break if you send things they don't
expect

151
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:02,940
as just a talk yesterday a javascript
conference where a guy from

152
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:07,930
copper was talking about here they put
in their user agent string hey I'm opera

153
00:09:07,930 --> 00:09:11,440
and current leader seeking their version
is 9.8 even though

154
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:15,899
with the released version 12 the promise
that there are millions of web sites out

155
00:09:15,899 --> 00:09:16,149
there

156
00:09:16,110 --> 00:09:19,890
only look at the very first character
the version number so when they tried

157
00:09:19,890 --> 00:09:21,720
going from nine to 10

158
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:24,440
all the sites and we thought they were
offered version one and then started

159
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:26,580
putting me on blinking banners and X

160
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:30,050
and naps so okay

161
00:09:30,050 --> 00:09:33,070
so this is just an example what goes to
reach EP let's look at what

162
00:09:33,070 --> 00:09:37,089
all these other things are and we're not
gonna go through in one by one I just

163
00:09:37,089 --> 00:09:39,350
want to point out some big categories
here

164
00:09:39,350 --> 00:09:42,860
so

165
00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:46,959
there are things like CSS files CSS
files are just Style Sheets

166
00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:51,810
they describe Hall elements on the page
get laid out our whole thing out

167
00:09:51,810 --> 00:09:55,589
that this text has a blue color this
area has a certain amount of padding

168
00:09:55,589 --> 00:09:58,820
nothing too bad there this is a
javascript file

169
00:09:58,820 --> 00:10:02,470
this is the from a script tag on the
page

170
00:10:02,470 --> 00:10:05,829
some javascript files are served
directly by the New York Times

171
00:10:05,829 --> 00:10:09,279
but you notice is from che esta NY t dot
com

172
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:13,269
instead of New York Times dot com a lot
of website

173
00:10:13,269 --> 00:10:16,600
actually use a separate domain name to
serve static content

174
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:20,970
cop and it's not dynamic the reason for
this has to do with

175
00:10:20,970 --> 00:10:24,060
I this limitation that browsers

176
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:27,290
voluntarily agreed two years ago where
he wouldn't try to retrieve

177
00:10:27,290 --> 00:10:30,779
too many items from a single domain at
one time in order to

178
00:10:30,779 --> 00:10:34,160
keep those servers from being
overwhelmed what that means is now

179
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:37,860
effectively if you're trying to serve a
page with lots and lots elements

180
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:41,649
you have to set up a lot of different
domain name server all the different

181
00:10:41,649 --> 00:10:45,610
pieces from them in order to get the
most bang with from the server back to

182
00:10:45,610 --> 00:10:50,920
your web browser so I'm not too worried
about the New York Times dot com stuff

183
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:54,040
I'm sure yet graphics 8 NY Times

184
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:58,760
now this actually a reason why some
content gets her from Nyte incentives

185
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:02,200
are from New York Times and I have to do
with cookies

186
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:07,570
if we go back to you now the cookies
here

187
00:11:07,570 --> 00:11:11,279
you'll see that there's this setting
which is kinda not expanded very well

188
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:14,019
call to me

189
00:11:14,019 --> 00:11:18,440
and when you send a cookie back down you
can actually set the main so

190
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:22,019
you can say that this applies just two
my site done

191
00:11:22,019 --> 00:11:25,130
and New York Times dot com order placed
anything

192
00:11:25,130 --> 00:11:28,209
at New York Times stock and so

193
00:11:28,209 --> 00:11:32,329
if you want a cookie to be transparently
pass between servers

194
00:11:32,329 --> 00:11:35,670
then you need for them to share some
root domain but if you don't care about

195
00:11:35,670 --> 00:11:40,930
the cookies being passed back and forth
and you can use a different domain

196
00:11:40,930 --> 00:11:45,570
okay like a hit the new york times for
too long but there are some

197
00:11:45,570 --> 00:11:49,940
very curious things I saw when I was
poking at this last night

198
00:11:49,940 --> 00:11:55,200
meter if you remember I guess is a
couple years ago did your time started

199
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:56,579
charging for

200
00:11:56,579 --> 00:11:59,959
doing more than like 10 or 15 articles
on the web site

201
00:11:59,959 --> 00:12:04,269
a month meet at JSS a javascript file
the dust that

202
00:12:04,269 --> 00:12:07,950
and effectively it does it by ICP a
cookie on your local browser and every

203
00:12:07,950 --> 00:12:09,620
time you get a new article

204
00:12:09,620 --> 00:12:13,079
increments that number in the cookie
when you get to a certain number

205
00:12:13,079 --> 00:12:16,740
that's gonna go and suddenly start doing
popups on top are you saying

206
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:20,779
me login we get a subscription

207
00:12:20,779 --> 00:12:24,450
and if you look here in the developer
tools will see this preview actually

208
00:12:24,450 --> 00:12:27,300
shows what's in this javascript file

209
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:30,870
okay so this is where we come to neutral
because

210
00:12:30,870 --> 00:12:34,010
this is one well actually this isn't a
bad lie

211
00:12:34,010 --> 00:12:37,209
there's definitely some lines there were
some ass but we

212
00:12:37,209 --> 00:12:40,459
me know this is kinda hard for human to
read so let's use

213
00:12:40,459 --> 00:12:44,620
a website called she s cute a fired-up
ordered

214
00:12:44,620 --> 00:12:49,160
and grabbing that all shopping at
switching back to Mozilla

215
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:53,660
so chance peter fire not already exists
to UNMIN if I JavaScript

216
00:12:53,660 --> 00:12:56,790
a lot of times if you're watching what
goes over the network and looking at

217
00:12:56,790 --> 00:12:58,420
these javascript files

218
00:12:58,420 --> 00:13:01,490
you're gonna see that they're very
compact they had all the white space

219
00:13:01,490 --> 00:13:03,550
remove they just yell

220
00:13:03,550 --> 00:13:07,050
this is actually not done necessarily
keep you from looking at 'em

221
00:13:07,050 --> 00:13:10,339
it's done to reduce the size that they
are when sent over the network said the

222
00:13:10,339 --> 00:13:12,170
web page is a quicker

223
00:13:12,170 --> 00:13:16,959
so gonna take this code pasted in here

224
00:13:16,959 --> 00:13:23,790
and that was not actually is go back

225
00:13:23,790 --> 00:13:30,790
our control A's stripes pops

226
00:13:33,670 --> 00:13:37,489
ok

227
00:13:37,489 --> 00:13:42,740
ok copy that tab over

228
00:13:42,740 --> 00:13:46,520
okay much smaller amount there but not
everything

229
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:50,689
okay I'll do this for nothing but what
does GS purifier does is it goes and

230
00:13:50,690 --> 00:13:51,210
takes

231
00:13:51,210 --> 00:13:55,550
this javascript okay

232
00:13:55,550 --> 00:13:59,100
awesome well no cuz I so need the

233
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:02,160
getting the data structure front I'll
grab another bigger script here in a

234
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:02,689
moment

235
00:14:02,690 --> 00:14:06,170
will work better I so

236
00:14:06,170 --> 00:14:10,460
what's interesting about this is
actually is a real JavaScript code

237
00:14:10,460 --> 00:14:14,970
this is something called Jason P Jason P

238
00:14:14,970 --> 00:14:19,380
well go in the background web pages can
request content

239
00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:22,670
I as part of their code running and the
use a technique called

240
00:14:22,670 --> 00:14:27,600
Ajax I HX originally stood for a
synchronous JavaScript and XML

241
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:30,610
the XML partisan used as much anymore
now X

242
00:14:30,610 --> 00:14:35,600
yes Jason format JavaScript object
notation the promise set by default

243
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:39,280
the you can only send ajax request back
to the server that originally served a

244
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:40,120
web page

245
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:44,740
well that doesn't work so well for
trying to talk to all these third party

246
00:14:44,740 --> 00:14:45,360
sites

247
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:49,190
to someone cleverly came up with the
idea that well you can grab a script

248
00:14:49,190 --> 00:14:50,000
from anywhere

249
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,950
so why don't we set it up so you at a
script tag into your document

250
00:14:53,950 --> 00:14:57,410
that will within load JavaScript from
external server

251
00:14:57,410 --> 00:15:00,550
and all that JavaScript gonna do is call
a function that you've already defined

252
00:15:00,550 --> 00:15:01,540
with all this data

253
00:15:01,540 --> 00:15:06,630
that's what Jason Pearson it's a way
that you can get around this cross site

254
00:15:06,630 --> 00:15:09,720
am request problem okay

255
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:12,810
let's find something really insidious
here

256
00:15:12,810 --> 00:15:17,230
this looks fun sons from KRT X dotnet

257
00:15:17,230 --> 00:15:20,960
oh here we go this is why I like this is
good JavaScript here

258
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:24,020
this is what I was talking about when I
said minify

259
00:15:24,020 --> 00:15:27,630
this I don't think anyone can reliably
read that

260
00:15:27,630 --> 00:15:31,390
but I can using JSP to fire we

261
00:15:31,390 --> 00:15:38,390
all the way to the end

262
00:15:40,170 --> 00:15:40,980
yeah okay

263
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:44,670
so this is why when you go to the New
York Times site after cash has been

264
00:15:44,670 --> 00:15:47,730
cleared and actually loads up almost a
megabyte with the data

265
00:15:47,730 --> 00:15:51,910
a lot of it is shy and JavaScript files
like

266
00:15:51,910 --> 00:15:55,640
let's maybe start down there

267
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:59,860
Trulia control shift a

268
00:15:59,860 --> 00:16:03,300
did not work very well because okay

269
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:09,170
hearing okay that just took a long time

270
00:16:09,170 --> 00:16:13,080
even peace Tana beautify sir gonna get
up to the top up their

271
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:17,420
I know white space beautiful run it

272
00:16:17,420 --> 00:16:20,940
okay that looks like more like code you
can actually

273
00:16:20,940 --> 00:16:24,440
and looking through this I mean

274
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:29,250
figuring out what is does is gonna take
a while because a lot of it just

275
00:16:29,250 --> 00:16:30,810
boilerplate code because

276
00:16:30,810 --> 00:16:34,530
JavaScript programs like these lotta
frameworks with lots of extra code to do

277
00:16:34,530 --> 00:16:35,150
what they do

278
00:16:35,150 --> 00:16:38,470
I but you can often look for things like

279
00:16:38,470 --> 00:16:42,750
references to ads references to tracking
I M

280
00:16:42,750 --> 00:16:45,980
references to EX delete sounds like a

281
00:16:45,980 --> 00:16:50,820
black I'm not sure so yeah that's just
an example of

282
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:54,120
all kinda stuff that goes on there are a
few interesting

283
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:58,720
what seabright Co Brightcove is a
provider a video services

284
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:01,800
so and this is actually a 1 pixel white

285
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:06,360
yes this initially Brightcove is using
this to track the user that using video

286
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:07,110
on your side

287
00:17:07,110 --> 00:17:10,370
I am will go down

288
00:17:10,370 --> 00:17:14,330
pain there's lotsa stuff I was looking
through the I found

289
00:17:14,329 --> 00:17:17,540
more references to Google for analytics
SRS

290
00:17:17,540 --> 00:17:20,760
DoubleClick which is google-owned ad
agency

291
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:24,790
which is used to serve all those ads and
even if just the two or three other ad

292
00:17:24,790 --> 00:17:27,119
networks are being used in various parts
of the page

293
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:30,600
I what I can tell this is basically the
New York Times is primarily concerned

294
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:33,580
with tracking their readers and selling
after them

295
00:17:33,580 --> 00:17:38,520
which camp that's how they make their
money before a jump while

296
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:43,310
at a show another troll service with GSP
to fire which is great for JavaScript

297
00:17:43,310 --> 00:17:43,879
code

298
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:48,560
another tools she some left and this is
what I use if you just have to chase and

299
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:49,500
data structure

300
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:53,710
actually uses in programming a lot
because not only does it expand a min if

301
00:17:53,710 --> 00:17:54,970
I G some structure

302
00:17:54,970 --> 00:17:58,970
but it also tells you he made a mistake
and so you're writing code that sends

303
00:17:58,970 --> 00:18:01,550
data back and forth and you happen to
leave out a comma

304
00:18:01,550 --> 00:18:06,290
forget to quote something this will give
you the arafat okay

305
00:18:06,290 --> 00:18:11,420
so the chrome another troll which

306
00:18:11,420 --> 00:18:15,410
is very useful now switch back to New
York Times to show you how this works

307
00:18:15,410 --> 00:18:19,830
there is an extension is available for
the Firefox and Chrome called Adblock

308
00:18:19,830 --> 00:18:20,439
Plus

309
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:23,920
I this is a perot effort a really
amazing thing

310
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:27,680
and I have it and the people here so
that

311
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:31,340
going to the toolbar and right now it's
crazy out saying Adblock Plus is not

312
00:18:31,340 --> 00:18:31,870
active

313
00:18:31,870 --> 00:18:36,160
let's turn it back on to the site and
let's reload the page and see how much

314
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:37,510
less stuff gets loaded

315
00:18:37,510 --> 00:18:43,549
so switching back to develop tools what
we've seen here

316
00:18:43,549 --> 00:18:49,350
193 your quest about $225k summer those
are paying since reloaded the page but

317
00:18:49,350 --> 00:18:55,630
not worry okay back over here to reload

318
00:18:55,630 --> 00:19:01,100
week for this to come up okay let's
finish loading

319
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:07,340
switch back to death tolls 3 has many
request we had a little less data

320
00:19:07,340 --> 00:19:08,270
transferred

321
00:19:08,270 --> 00:19:11,860
I what you'll see with Adblock Plus

322
00:19:11,860 --> 00:19:16,620
is that we're now missing these whole
area secure the top the pager showing

323
00:19:16,620 --> 00:19:17,179
and

324
00:19:17,179 --> 00:19:22,040
were missing this flash ad that was over
here the pages that a lot easier to use

325
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:25,559
and in a lot of situations it means that
up

326
00:19:25,559 --> 00:19:28,629
yes side effect leading developer tools
by the way

327
00:19:28,630 --> 00:19:31,630
is you'll find a lot of bad programming
out there

328
00:19:31,630 --> 00:19:36,270
%uh JavaScript code in general is very
resilient areas because it's a venture

329
00:19:36,270 --> 00:19:37,090
event in a few

330
00:19:37,090 --> 00:19:40,340
had a love that and threw an exception
well that's not a problem because

331
00:19:40,340 --> 00:19:40,820
another

332
00:19:40,820 --> 00:19:44,320
come along in a minute but I get the
death toll standoff

333
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:47,960
fan you might wanna go down here to this
area and

334
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:52,350
sheesh to man's you can see this am

335
00:19:52,350 --> 00:19:56,470
mall really off the edge in the
projector there there's a law firm stop

336
00:19:56,470 --> 00:19:56,919
sign

337
00:19:56,919 --> 00:20:00,669
and if you click on it then it will tell
if not the possum exceptions and then

338
00:20:00,669 --> 00:20:01,380
you'll be able to

339
00:20:01,380 --> 00:20:05,940
keep running all that wonderful
JavaScript code without having it

340
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:09,160
stop in the debugger every time okay

341
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:14,350
so that is my first example New York
Times sound before jumping another

342
00:20:14,350 --> 00:20:16,340
example though I wanted to point out

343
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:20,760
a few other web pages that were familiar
with so let's go over to next one

344
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:23,910
wonderful hope number nine website I

345
00:20:23,910 --> 00:20:27,179
just to do bring the developer tools for
that one

346
00:20:27,179 --> 00:20:32,230
hope the website here is much much
better than your time to store the stuff

347
00:20:32,230 --> 00:20:36,010
request so going to the Network tab in
doing a reload

348
00:20:36,010 --> 00:20:40,100
all really seeing as it's loading some
Fox have a Google

349
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:41,510
and

350
00:20:41,510 --> 00:20:45,350
and there's also some code here

351
00:20:45,350 --> 00:20:49,250
to show tweets from Twitter which means
that Twitter does have you believe that

352
00:20:49,250 --> 00:20:52,110
necessarily track you go to the site
when you're logged in

353
00:20:52,110 --> 00:20:55,270
but that's about the only one oh wait no
actually this

354
00:20:55,270 --> 00:20:58,800
underscore you TM using Google Analytics
to cell you

355
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:01,910
they know who visits and so does Google
I am

356
00:21:01,910 --> 00:21:07,610
on a nicer front let's go to our friends
at 2600

357
00:21:07,610 --> 00:21:12,420
and bring up the dev tools

358
00:21:12,420 --> 00:21:19,230
that's not what it do between the two
web page

359
00:21:19,230 --> 00:21:22,860
is all done wonderful and it actually

360
00:21:22,860 --> 00:21:26,830
doesn't look very much at all I only
thing I saw

361
00:21:26,830 --> 00:21:30,879
looking at it there was a loading was
the Google search box inside it

362
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:34,820
am so everything else was too slow to
find some servers

363
00:21:34,820 --> 00:21:39,840
good job 2600 okay so

364
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:44,510
back too much allowed just to recap the
tools we talk about their the crime

365
00:21:44,510 --> 00:21:45,440
developer tools

366
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:48,800
built in the chrome everyone has chrome
on their

367
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:52,390
desktop/laptop Chromebook has access to
this

368
00:21:52,390 --> 00:21:56,680
if using Chrome I and Rory the developer
tools are quite there but

369
00:21:56,680 --> 00:22:01,440
google has basically said the death
tolls to allow remote debugging

370
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:05,120
you can actually run from your desktop
running on Android device

371
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:09,180
and then connect to the Android device
and do all the same kind inspecting

372
00:22:09,180 --> 00:22:13,370
you're actually looking at what's
happening on the device i GS beautify

373
00:22:13,370 --> 00:22:17,100
Jason went in and Adblock Plus that's
number one

374
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:21,190
let's look at number two Facebook the

375
00:22:21,190 --> 00:22:24,740
china collection have irrelevant
information that we all media

376
00:22:24,740 --> 00:22:30,300
us enjoy all the time I'm guilty I do
Facebook I am

377
00:22:30,300 --> 00:22:34,950
so going over to are nice face pic i'm
looking at here im

378
00:22:34,950 --> 00:22:40,140
Mozilla I in Firefox show up with
Firefox go to tools to do so

379
00:22:40,140 --> 00:22:43,160
asset like a few generations ago

380
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:46,260
Firefox developer tools basically was a
JavaScript console

381
00:22:46,260 --> 00:22:51,210
I am they've done a lotta work and what
do you visualize a web page in so I'm

382
00:22:51,210 --> 00:22:52,510
gonna give you a tip line

383
00:22:52,510 --> 00:22:55,710
what will make you look like leaders
packard all your friends

384
00:22:55,710 --> 00:22:59,180
okay so I'm going on here in the middle
the page

385
00:22:59,180 --> 00:23:03,220
I right click on it and I do inspect
element so

386
00:23:03,220 --> 00:23:06,330
this by itself it just kinda me because
I'm highlighted something

387
00:23:06,330 --> 00:23:11,620
agassi 0 this isn't HTML span it has a
CSS class message body on it

388
00:23:11,620 --> 00:23:14,730
but if you go down to the very bottom of
the page

389
00:23:14,730 --> 00:23:18,100
which you know I have to be out for
scream just works

390
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:22,820
but ok

391
00:23:22,820 --> 00:23:29,659
so inspect to see this top or the bottom
this shows you kinda let you pop up

392
00:23:29,660 --> 00:23:31,920
things like doing the HTML the page

393
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:35,950
few CSS stuff that supplied and then
they have the same cop

394
00:23:35,950 --> 00:23:39,350
3d view this is totally out of jurassic
park

395
00:23:39,350 --> 00:23:43,700
I know you next I click on it and then
all of a sudden

396
00:23:43,700 --> 00:23:47,350
an even better

397
00:23:47,350 --> 00:23:52,710
I

398
00:23:52,710 --> 00:23:57,560
the so

399
00:23:57,560 --> 00:24:01,419
there actually is a practical reason
from

400
00:24:01,420 --> 00:24:06,060
doing this it lets you really easily
visualize how all these HTML elements

401
00:24:06,060 --> 00:24:10,159
are stacked on top of each other ideas
inside a div sedatives

402
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:14,560
and you can see things like if you
messed up in your HTML text and didn't

403
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:18,639
yo indeed something early and so it
didn't continue down the page you can

404
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:19,340
tell that

405
00:24:19,340 --> 00:24:23,899
but it's also just in who was looking at
the web from the site I

406
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:27,580
I

407
00:24:27,580 --> 00:24:30,600
so I want to make sure you all know
about that

408
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:34,360
it's awesome I now from the

409
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:37,399
the donut holes here one of the great
things you can do with this issue can

410
00:24:37,399 --> 00:24:39,490
play around with the actual content

411
00:24:39,490 --> 00:24:44,220
I am like okay my friend a six-year
wants to know how to remove trending

412
00:24:44,220 --> 00:24:44,929
articles

413
00:24:44,929 --> 00:24:49,919
you know that's kinda annoying I don't
like to use the word trending

414
00:24:49,919 --> 00:24:54,770
so I can go and HTML if you hear and

415
00:24:54,770 --> 00:25:00,200
and well I can actually change the text
if this

416
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:04,270
I can go to something like this image
ahead event that's fine

417
00:25:04,270 --> 00:25:10,070
inspect his lawyer your office and I can
go and I can change the attributes I

418
00:25:10,070 --> 00:25:12,250
could change this and just get rid of
source

419
00:25:12,250 --> 00:25:15,680
now he doesn't have an appearance
anymore

420
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:19,150
you can imagine the fun you can have
going to someone's facebook page

421
00:25:19,150 --> 00:25:22,610
now this doesn't change anything on the
server body like go there change some

422
00:25:22,610 --> 00:25:25,040
pictures in the middle love the feed and
then bring some over

423
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:29,120
hey look at what this person did with
his other person awesome I

424
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:32,390
the practical side of this though some

425
00:25:32,390 --> 00:25:35,760
if you actually doing web development
you can do it all lost about the styles

426
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:36,250
and you can

427
00:25:36,250 --> 00:25:40,340
go ahead it styles and see how they
affect things in it super useful

428
00:25:40,340 --> 00:25:44,270
actually building web pages I looking at
Facebook here

429
00:25:44,270 --> 00:25:49,510
we want to look if you want to get the
secret information Firefox you can crow

430
00:25:49,510 --> 00:25:51,200
about all the stuff that gets loaded

431
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:56,690
that's not yet available on the built in
dept buttresses extension called Firebug

432
00:25:56,690 --> 00:26:00,700
which how shop over here to the page on
it Firebug

433
00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:04,810
is kinda be original super awesome web
developer tool

434
00:26:04,810 --> 00:26:08,940
and it is what it has inspired all the
development or work in the browser meant

435
00:26:08,940 --> 00:26:09,860
vendors himself

436
00:26:09,860 --> 00:26:14,120
so I have Firebug install and if I go up
to

437
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:19,110
trolls view Firebug

438
00:26:19,110 --> 00:26:24,290
then I kinda have a very similar thing
here is like the job consul showing me

439
00:26:24,290 --> 00:26:25,800
all the stuff that's been fetched

440
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:29,650
I go to the net tab that shows you all
the things

441
00:26:29,650 --> 00:26:33,610
was noticing when I was looking at
Facebook last night is that Facebook is

442
00:26:33,610 --> 00:26:34,790
very monolithic

443
00:26:34,790 --> 00:26:38,740
what I mean by that is that face because
basically going

444
00:26:38,740 --> 00:26:42,170
and fetching everything from its own
servers it doesn't go out to google

445
00:26:42,170 --> 00:26:43,290
voice doesn't go out to ya

446
00:26:43,290 --> 00:26:47,350
to Microsoft anyone face pic together
its

447
00:26:47,350 --> 00:26:50,750
its it doesn't all itself so it's
tracking all this information but

448
00:26:50,750 --> 00:26:54,700
basically only on Facebook same domains
on

449
00:26:54,700 --> 00:26:59,140
so was in a lot super interesting here
on nice things about this so

450
00:26:59,140 --> 00:27:03,910
the network panel like show you just
HTML files to get loaded just CSS

451
00:27:03,910 --> 00:27:07,730
X hrs ist request made from the page
itself after

452
00:27:07,730 --> 00:27:10,850
pages unloaded I if you like to

453
00:27:10,850 --> 00:27:14,540
do things like seeps with files you can
go here in CT your else about the flash

454
00:27:14,540 --> 00:27:15,050
files

455
00:27:15,050 --> 00:27:18,110
age are all the images here

456
00:27:18,110 --> 00:27:22,680
and help you get my slot reviews as you
go down someone to the doctor horrible

457
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:23,160
picture

458
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:26,330
awesome I Firebug

459
00:27:26,330 --> 00:27:29,490
3 extension he can go to add on stuff
Firefox sir

460
00:27:29,490 --> 00:27:33,290
advancements in with a common download
it or just get fire but dot com

461
00:27:33,290 --> 00:27:37,680
okay so switching back to mass

462
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:42,030
lives again so met you can do with
Firefox

463
00:27:42,030 --> 00:27:46,120
I mean I find both have been very useful
chromosomal is a bit quicker to get into

464
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:47,090
things but

465
00:27:47,090 --> 00:27:50,680
I found the back and keep a lid he's in
Firefox and just see though he's a

466
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:52,570
changeup styles to be super useful

467
00:27:52,570 --> 00:27:55,780
okay same number three TweetDeck

468
00:27:55,780 --> 00:28:00,520
TweetDeck is not you can use it over the
web between Dec is an actual

469
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:04,190
application it uses a web protocols to
talk to Twitter to do all these various

470
00:28:04,190 --> 00:28:05,900
searches and things for you

471
00:28:05,900 --> 00:28:10,330
but it's not raining in the process so
how do we figure out what it's doing

472
00:28:10,330 --> 00:28:13,419
well shoes we get to use a few tools

473
00:28:13,420 --> 00:28:17,820
first one is one which lot are you for
me were called Wireshark

474
00:28:17,820 --> 00:28:23,429
Wireshark Isis cross-platform short runs
on Linux and Windows and Mac

475
00:28:23,430 --> 00:28:27,400
it basically sits and reads all the
network traffic going

476
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:31,120
from your computer to another other
computers on the network so if we talked

477
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:31,830
to start

478
00:28:31,830 --> 00:28:35,740
and going even interface there was going
to start

479
00:28:35,740 --> 00:28:42,740
up TweetDeck to tweet external load up
is gonna show my Twitter timelines and

480
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:45,160
things from Facebook so on

481
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:50,700
let's put that away sure in Wireshark
we've actually gone we see

482
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:55,000
all this traffic going out so looking at
it we sort

483
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:58,290
well let's stop the capture if we sort
by protocol

484
00:28:58,290 --> 00:29:02,409
that and a cheapy stuff is a stuff
that's been sent in the clear back and

485
00:29:02,410 --> 00:29:03,610
forth from the application

486
00:29:03,610 --> 00:29:06,870
or some other things running on this PC
I

487
00:29:06,870 --> 00:29:10,800
week also in the having a lot up traffic
like this which is

488
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:15,900
a GPS unfortunately TweetDeck uses a
secure visionary cheapy to talk between

489
00:29:15,900 --> 00:29:16,970
it and Twitter

490
00:29:16,970 --> 00:29:20,130
and Wireshark can

491
00:29:20,130 --> 00:29:23,680
snoop on unencrypted traffic when it
comes to being crafted staff

492
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:26,850
you can be easily tell you who you're
talking to but can't tell you what's in

493
00:29:26,850 --> 00:29:28,540
that conversation

494
00:29:28,540 --> 00:29:33,010
to you like go and look at a each EP
transaction

495
00:29:33,010 --> 00:29:36,340
finished telling you hey here's how it
starts a poet said she picked file

496
00:29:36,340 --> 00:29:38,400
that's being sent over the network

497
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:42,360
but we go to something each p s than

498
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:45,580
you can basically tell us a little bit
about what's going on but captain

499
00:29:45,580 --> 00:29:49,600
do need to Christian same Wireshark is
great for sticking out

500
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:53,970
what your service programs are talking
to but we need something else to be one

501
00:29:53,970 --> 00:29:55,320
actually discover what

502
00:29:55,320 --> 00:29:58,520
the conversation is between TweetDeck
and Twitter

503
00:29:58,520 --> 00:30:02,200
so let's with Wireshark

504
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:06,330
and not a program this one ish actually
shareware rather than

505
00:30:06,330 --> 00:30:09,560
open software called charles proxy but

506
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:12,600
its wanna bet he's a share accused

507
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:17,810
to watch what charles proxy does it it's
except a SSL proxy on your local machine

508
00:30:17,810 --> 00:30:21,830
and it also goes and install the tomb
certificate you can toggle on/off into

509
00:30:21,830 --> 00:30:23,409
your web browsers

510
00:30:23,410 --> 00:30:28,370
and for the Mac it actually accepted
into the system certificates

511
00:30:28,370 --> 00:30:32,660
that means that if your web app tries to
any GPS transaction

512
00:30:32,660 --> 00:30:36,110
it's actually gonna end up talking to
charles proxy which sits in the middle

513
00:30:36,110 --> 00:30:38,210
of everything

514
00:30:38,210 --> 00:30:43,750
so now let's go back to TweetDeck and
quit and restarted

515
00:30:43,750 --> 00:30:48,270
making sure that I'm recording now you
have two more configuration you have to

516
00:30:48,270 --> 00:30:51,190
tell it the one except traffic Malta
maynes

517
00:30:51,190 --> 00:30:55,050
you have to make sure that you have a
certificate installed correctly or else

518
00:30:55,050 --> 00:30:59,350
TweetDeck will complain about this but
now we gonna charles proxy we see all

519
00:30:59,350 --> 00:31:00,590
these requests notice

520
00:31:00,590 --> 00:31:03,850
HTTPS requests so if we look at this

521
00:31:03,850 --> 00:31:08,050
we can actually going see okay it's
actually doing this request

522
00:31:08,050 --> 00:31:11,540
here's why the timing here's what it
sent to grab the

523
00:31:11,540 --> 00:31:15,120
corrupted file here's a response to came
back

524
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:18,440
and so you can use is to do a lot of
discovery like

525
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:22,030
not just finding out what public API
something like TweetDeck refusing

526
00:31:22,030 --> 00:31:25,090
but also private API's bad for things
like a

527
00:31:25,090 --> 00:31:28,950
session keys special a lotta web URL

528
00:31:28,950 --> 00:31:34,490
are weather API issues special client
keys identify what particular client

529
00:31:34,490 --> 00:31:37,520
and the USS so that if some client you

530
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:40,810
does bad things in the future they can
turn it off the server or they can also

531
00:31:40,810 --> 00:31:44,050
limit how much their client access

532
00:31:44,050 --> 00:31:48,330
so you notice is also playing a lot of
other information ok this is just

533
00:31:48,330 --> 00:31:49,129
noticing

534
00:31:49,130 --> 00:31:52,160
the fact based on the new york times
open in the background so

535
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:55,370
nothing to worry about their a pH
Widdecombe is kinda the most interesting

536
00:31:55,370 --> 00:31:56,660
one

537
00:31:56,660 --> 00:32:00,920
okay if you're if I credentials so
something to check on that

538
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:04,360
I am the solar quest to get lists the

539
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:08,210
Contax I here's a case we can use a
wonderful Jason plant

540
00:32:08,210 --> 00:32:11,360
copy all that back to Firefox

541
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:15,890
back to chase on land here

542
00:32:15,890 --> 00:32:20,920
paste and validate

543
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:25,570
after just a moment okay now we have all
this data they get sent in that

544
00:32:25,570 --> 00:32:30,600
secure stream just shown any nice easily
doable format

545
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:33,960
and I will be invalidating all my
sessions immediately after the stock

546
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:39,270
I so that charles proxy the very useful
tool %ah

547
00:32:39,270 --> 00:32:43,410
worthwhile to register you can do 30
days free but it pops up kinda annoying

548
00:32:43,410 --> 00:32:44,230
things during

549
00:32:44,230 --> 00:32:49,480
what's right and it also is nice at
charles proxy well

550
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:55,170
go and it under fix itself when you shut
it down so

551
00:32:55,170 --> 00:32:59,160
huge only going to intercept
transactions what actually running

552
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:02,590
okay one more example here

553
00:33:02,590 --> 00:33:06,190
just here's a tools we use get up

554
00:33:06,190 --> 00:33:11,660
I I miss our developer my day job is
managing a big open source project

555
00:33:11,660 --> 00:33:15,060
so a lot of what I do during the day
issues get help to

556
00:33:15,060 --> 00:33:17,669
not just a few of my own code I've
written but also review code other

557
00:33:17,670 --> 00:33:19,200
people have written

558
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:23,560
so let's go back to Firefox here

559
00:33:23,560 --> 00:33:30,560
and bring up might get her

560
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:34,059
okay so yep

561
00:33:34,059 --> 00:33:39,299
use my his friend get help page arm one
of the open source projects

562
00:33:39,299 --> 00:33:43,350
I'm heavily involved with this thing
called and your javascript framework so

563
00:33:43,350 --> 00:33:46,850
when we switch over to doing things as
enya 0

564
00:33:46,850 --> 00:33:51,590
and we have this widget library called
onyx

565
00:33:51,590 --> 00:33:55,669
which I clicked one and

566
00:33:55,669 --> 00:33:59,850
if you've done anything get hub one way
to people collaborate despite taking

567
00:33:59,850 --> 00:34:01,429
Europe Austria code

568
00:34:01,429 --> 00:34:04,529
working on it and then send your poor
quest for change

569
00:34:04,529 --> 00:34:08,500
so I have an open palm request for my
friend Kevin

570
00:34:08,500 --> 00:34:14,820
he wants me to your view this code
updated so I do a lot of this code

571
00:34:14,820 --> 00:34:15,280
review

572
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:21,190
and because interface is fine for me to
actually go on a Mac lead to a lot of

573
00:34:21,190 --> 00:34:21,700
things

574
00:34:21,700 --> 00:34:24,869
and there's just merge pull request down
here

575
00:34:24,869 --> 00:34:29,510
actually before you do that let me
disabled grease monkey

576
00:34:29,510 --> 00:34:32,339
can talk about greasemonkey if you
haven't used grease monkey is really

577
00:34:32,339 --> 00:34:32,730
great

578
00:34:32,730 --> 00:34:37,480
ok Sep reloaded the page that grease
monkey thank you merge pull request its

579
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:38,379
gonna show me

580
00:34:38,379 --> 00:34:43,899
ok here's kinda the description of it
and the way our project is running

581
00:34:43,899 --> 00:34:47,159
every time I do something I have to add
a line that says

582
00:34:47,159 --> 00:34:50,659
reviewed by blah blah my name and email
address

583
00:34:50,659 --> 00:34:56,909
think it's tedious so what I decided to
do with use grease monkey which is sis

584
00:34:56,909 --> 00:35:01,520
plugin add-on for Firefox that lets you
do things called user scripts

585
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:05,380
the idea behind greasemonkey is that you
can set up a bunch a javascript file

586
00:35:05,380 --> 00:35:09,589
soviet loaded conditionally depending on
what pages and

587
00:35:09,589 --> 00:35:13,390
the user script is code you've written
your code report from someone else

588
00:35:13,390 --> 00:35:17,359
and that can go in modify what's on the
page add new features

589
00:35:17,359 --> 00:35:21,770
high-paying show things just change the
whole experience

590
00:35:21,770 --> 00:35:26,530
this is what I think I really love about
the web because if I wanted to add a

591
00:35:26,530 --> 00:35:27,560
feature to get high

592
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:31,330
I can send email to their developers me
to get a response a few days we're

593
00:35:31,330 --> 00:35:31,740
seeing

594
00:35:31,740 --> 00:35:34,869
hey that sounds great we'll put on a
list to handle some time in the future

595
00:35:34,869 --> 00:35:39,200
or maybe they would normie but sex is
all based on the web platform and we

596
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:41,040
have access to know what's going on

597
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:44,930
we can actually right around code that
extends these web sites force

598
00:35:44,930 --> 00:35:48,589
so I'm gonna turn increase my key back
on

599
00:35:48,589 --> 00:35:54,109
and reload this page so what it is I
take me to use

600
00:35:54,109 --> 00:35:57,290
use a script here which as reviewed by

601
00:35:57,290 --> 00:36:01,849
and so if I tap that here's my review by
message stock immediately into the tax

602
00:36:01,849 --> 00:36:06,220
so let's see how I did that greasemonkey

603
00:36:06,220 --> 00:36:10,020
lets you create new user scripts I have
to load it here

604
00:36:10,020 --> 00:36:14,009
this is a the one that I wrote this is
mister script which is about a six

605
00:36:14,010 --> 00:36:17,290
thousand lines have JavaScript that
modify the kingdom of loathing online

606
00:36:17,290 --> 00:36:18,910
game to be a lead you to work with

607
00:36:18,910 --> 00:36:25,868
I the let's look at this one so bring it
up here in a text editor let me make

608
00:36:25,869 --> 00:36:26,920
that a larger

609
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:31,580
so what I'm just doing here is amusing
over the jQuery

610
00:36:31,580 --> 00:36:35,420
I've gone and I'm looking for that
merger quest button

611
00:36:35,420 --> 00:36:39,140
and I added a special behavior to it so
when it gets clicked on

612
00:36:39,140 --> 00:36:42,890
is good then run this code inside here
this code

613
00:36:42,890 --> 00:36:47,710
I does a set time out because I want
this to run a little bit in the future

614
00:36:47,710 --> 00:36:50,660
if we actually are clicking on the
button that has been created all those

615
00:36:50,660 --> 00:36:51,680
other pieces yet

616
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:55,720
but if I wait 10 milliseconds then the
new buttons I want the county will be

617
00:36:55,720 --> 00:36:56,180
there

618
00:36:56,180 --> 00:36:59,460
so I wait 10 milliseconds and then

619
00:36:59,460 --> 00:37:03,510
I'm gonna create my new little reviewed
by Patton I'm gonna put a click and run

620
00:37:03,510 --> 00:37:04,320
it that at

621
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:07,660
my special lying to it and then

622
00:37:07,660 --> 00:37:12,480
I'm going to stick after that but this
does have a little but I notice last

623
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:14,240
night they haven't actually fixed yet

624
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:17,390
if I cancel and then hit Mitch more

625
00:37:17,390 --> 00:37:20,680
merge pull request again have to review
by Patons

626
00:37:20,680 --> 00:37:24,098
and I can keep doing that because I
didn't actually check to see that

627
00:37:24,099 --> 00:37:27,580
I didn't have you know that already I
can live with that

628
00:37:27,580 --> 00:37:32,319
I might fix it one day that's right

629
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:35,570
attract I arm so I mean

630
00:37:35,570 --> 00:37:38,770
if your program are you can easily
create your own user scripts

631
00:37:38,770 --> 00:37:41,700
and the way I figured out whole you
where I want to put it was actually

632
00:37:41,700 --> 00:37:44,040
using those Firefox dev tools to look in

633
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:47,250
see what the classes for what all the
Don actually it's worth a dime to the

634
00:37:47,250 --> 00:37:47,839
page

635
00:37:47,839 --> 00:37:51,290
the good news is that you don't have to
do this just

636
00:37:51,290 --> 00:37:55,859
take advantage of them this is great
website user scripts .org that has

637
00:37:55,859 --> 00:38:01,200
thousands have scripts that other people
have contributed of we look here

638
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:05,480
I the most popular scripts tend to be
one to let you download videos from

639
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:08,390
YouTube for some reason people really
like doing that

640
00:38:08,390 --> 00:38:12,650
I but there seems like a Netflix queues
order to let you view the movies in room

641
00:38:12,650 --> 00:38:16,869
order luster for gaming sites for

642
00:38:16,869 --> 00:38:19,910
you cheesy reasons or

643
00:38:19,910 --> 00:38:23,649
in neighborly reasons so people would
kinda

644
00:38:23,650 --> 00:38:26,940
already gone and done a lot of work for
you out there and

645
00:38:26,940 --> 00:38:29,589
finding all these annoyances and pages
are displayed as well you want to

646
00:38:29,589 --> 00:38:32,190
customize at the website owners didn't
think I have

647
00:38:32,190 --> 00:38:35,250
and writing scripts Fort I am

648
00:38:35,250 --> 00:38:37,970
there are certain things you just can't
do they're not very effective in

649
00:38:37,970 --> 00:38:39,920
modifying Flash content

650
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:43,140
but the good news is that the web is
generally moving away from flash

651
00:38:43,140 --> 00:38:46,970
and more towards HTML JavaScript code

652
00:38:46,970 --> 00:38:51,880
and there's a lot of security work
that's been done around greasemonkey

653
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:55,550
one up there early promise he found us
that the original version

654
00:38:55,550 --> 00:38:59,540
would let scripts running on the web
page detect that the user data scripts

655
00:38:59,540 --> 00:39:00,800
to the page

656
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:03,880
and this certainly lead to this kind of
war between Peter she didn't want to be

657
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:06,540
modified in the users that want to
modify them

658
00:39:06,540 --> 00:39:10,859
where script we sitting around and
likely notice oh wait this was added by

659
00:39:10,859 --> 00:39:15,140
grease monkey I'm gonna go stop on that
or change my ID so we can modify things

660
00:39:15,140 --> 00:39:16,170
anymore

661
00:39:16,170 --> 00:39:19,619
I am grease monkey is actually running
all use a script code in a special

662
00:39:19,619 --> 00:39:20,830
sandbox

663
00:39:20,830 --> 00:39:25,299
where it only as access across a barrier
to what's on the web page

664
00:39:25,300 --> 00:39:29,640
and the webpage cat reach back into the
grease monkey stuff at all

665
00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:34,279
now this isn't just limited to Firefox
chrome supports user scripts as well

666
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:36,950
it actually has a built directly into
the router you don't have to get an

667
00:39:36,950 --> 00:39:37,910
add-on

668
00:39:37,910 --> 00:39:43,430
you just fine when are these files on
let's look at this one

669
00:39:43,430 --> 00:39:47,819
so if we downloaded this one are clicked
install

670
00:39:47,819 --> 00:39:52,589
then it would load a file you can really
see if it's called

671
00:39:52,589 --> 00:39:56,259
35 23 dot user .gs and

672
00:39:56,260 --> 00:39:59,849
chrome a smart enough to know that
things mean user .gs at the end user

673
00:39:59,849 --> 00:40:00,640
scripts

674
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:04,569
and so if you click on that from chrome
it rock you hate you once told a script

675
00:40:04,569 --> 00:40:05,259
inhabit

676
00:40:05,260 --> 00:40:08,890
and they have a whole management
interface either add-ons method

677
00:40:08,890 --> 00:40:14,400
so user scripts awesome toll definitely
worth checking out

678
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:17,640
so

679
00:40:17,640 --> 00:40:21,400
the good news is that bad the examples
I'm actually giving you the gift of

680
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:24,410
extra time for lunch extra time to go
see other panels

681
00:40:24,410 --> 00:40:31,410
but before I Inc can offer the request
was the audience about this kinda thing

682
00:40:31,869 --> 00:40:35,540
yes up in the front

683
00:40:35,540 --> 00:40:37,540
ok that sounds I

684
00:40:37,540 --> 00:40:42,070
that's built into Firefox saving 13
later

685
00:40:42,070 --> 00:40:45,830
so if you're in Firefox just right click
on an item

686
00:40:45,830 --> 00:40:50,500
do inspected element and then you can
turn off the

687
00:40:50,500 --> 00:40:53,950
the views on the side face buttons on
the bottom but then the button here's

688
00:40:53,950 --> 00:40:59,900
3d view saw 3d view and the Internet is
rotating

689
00:40:59,900 --> 00:41:05,130
yet

690
00:41:05,130 --> 00:41:08,230
anything else thank you all very much
out
