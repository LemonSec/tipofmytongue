1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:07,040
her I can also wait

2
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:07,750
our people

3
00:00:07,750 --> 00:00:14,750
still waiting to get here right okay

4
00:00:15,610 --> 00:00:19,259
all wait a couple minutes to

5
00:00:19,259 --> 00:00:22,539
let people get off the elevator hi

6
00:00:22,539 --> 00:00:26,329
my name is sigh I that is actually my
full name

7
00:00:26,329 --> 00:00:29,419
in case you're wondering I so

8
00:00:29,419 --> 00:00:32,820
I've started a few different things
other wanna be talking

9
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:35,940
with you today about is called

10
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:39,180
make your laws arm now just

11
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:44,990
as a brief promise I the style my
presentation here is not going to be the

12
00:00:44,990 --> 00:00:49,690
like false age I'm gonna give you a
lecture with the slides in the fanciness

13
00:00:49,690 --> 00:00:53,140
are I didn't think it was really
appropriate to this kind of

14
00:00:53,140 --> 00:00:56,540
audience are so it's going to be a
little bit more discusses

15
00:00:56,540 --> 00:01:00,160
I una Dover a number of things that

16
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:04,159
just come up very frequently or that are
helpful for understanding the concepts

17
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:07,450
but I'm gonna leave a lot more time for
Q&A than is usual

18
00:01:07,450 --> 00:01:10,760
are so if you have short

19
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:14,190
questions like for me to clarify
something or whatever

20
00:01:14,190 --> 00:01:17,190
take less than a minute for me to answer
to shout it out

21
00:01:17,190 --> 00:01:20,340
I preferably after I finish a sentence

22
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:25,350
arm if it's a longer question are you
want to make a pointer whatever

23
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:28,909
hold until after I finish and will talk
about

24
00:01:28,909 --> 00:01:33,409
arm and if you're gonna be twittering
this or whatever

25
00:01:33,409 --> 00:01:38,049
hash tag amyl make your loss direct arm

26
00:01:38,049 --> 00:01:43,790
so major losses as a project for liquid
democracy

27
00:01:43,790 --> 00:01:46,930
I all defined on a sec and its

28
00:01:46,930 --> 00:01:51,369
trying to basically takeover
legislatures

29
00:01:51,369 --> 00:01:55,299
I in a gradual process through kam
entirely legal means

30
00:01:55,299 --> 00:02:00,100
I N you might be wondering well why is
my first major talk about this at a

31
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:01,180
hacker conference

32
00:02:01,180 --> 00:02:04,619
are and the answer is I am

33
00:02:04,619 --> 00:02:08,549
we want to get people to make

34
00:02:08,549 --> 00:02:12,750
are the platform are I'm

35
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:16,560
the lead developer I am A in experienced
developer

36
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:19,910
by I can't do it myself as I

37
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:23,849
also certainly there's there's a lot of
very interesting subcomponents

38
00:02:23,849 --> 00:02:27,179
and there's arm

39
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:30,870
there's a lot of problems that need to
be solved not before

40
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:35,310
it can be done at all but as part of
doing and I think it's actually

41
00:02:35,310 --> 00:02:38,910
first important to appeal to serve the
maker side

42
00:02:38,910 --> 00:02:42,680
I love I activism as it were rather than

43
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:46,569
necessarily to people who want to get
very specific policy

44
00:02:46,569 --> 00:02:50,349
past more than work on the pop charts of

45
00:02:50,349 --> 00:02:54,970
arm so the current government's that we
have

46
00:02:54,970 --> 00:02:58,020
are fairly flawed and

47
00:02:58,020 --> 00:03:01,080
I think we all know the reasons I'm not
gonna name

48
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:04,200
particular policy parties are policies
but

49
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:09,640
arm third defacto controlled by entities
that don't really have the interests

50
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:12,730
are the general public %ah primary

51
00:03:12,730 --> 00:03:15,739
I even when their us

52
00:03:15,739 --> 00:03:18,800
I I'm relatively idealistic

53
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:22,020
their own our political objectives

54
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:26,180
often get in the way of serving the
public so for example

55
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:29,860
I one policy that you're never going to
see

56
00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:34,530
Republicans or Democrats support is real
empowerment to third parties

57
00:03:34,530 --> 00:03:37,860
arm even if they believe that

58
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:42,260
you know this particle air policy agenda
is a good one it would harm both for

59
00:03:42,260 --> 00:03:43,579
their parties and so

60
00:03:43,580 --> 00:03:46,769
since a between the two of them at least
they have a

61
00:03:46,769 --> 00:03:50,970
super super majority it's not gonna
happen if you rely on them

62
00:03:50,970 --> 00:03:54,530
arm so though what

63
00:03:54,530 --> 00:03:57,989
our approach is to do is to sort of hack

64
00:03:57,989 --> 00:04:01,680
the existing structure to do things are
that

65
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:06,250
are entirely legal within the letter and
the spirit of the law

66
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:11,099
but aren't necessarily what we're
anticipating so for example using a

67
00:04:11,099 --> 00:04:12,310
super PAC

68
00:04:12,310 --> 00:04:16,500
to fight super PACs and to promote
transparency

69
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:19,910
arm so first let me go back and

70
00:04:19,910 --> 00:04:22,970
explains a the basic concepts involved
so

71
00:04:22,970 --> 00:04:29,690
what kind of government is the United
States anyone

72
00:04:29,690 --> 00:04:33,969
ok good good so it we are a
representative democracy so people often

73
00:04:33,970 --> 00:04:35,560
loosely call this

74
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:39,600
a democracy just likely loosely called
are

75
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:43,120
UK which is a monarchy a democracy

76
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:46,820
arm so I think the essential component
the people refer to when they call

77
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:48,800
something a democracy is

78
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:53,370
a government that at least tries to be
up for the people and by the people on

79
00:04:53,370 --> 00:04:55,860
the believes that power resides and

80
00:04:55,860 --> 00:05:01,090
originates from the general electorate
rather than from the Queen

81
00:05:01,090 --> 00:05:05,470
arm the UK ends perhaps transitioning in
this regard

82
00:05:05,470 --> 00:05:08,759
arm eighty direct democracy

83
00:05:08,759 --> 00:05:12,220
is a very old concept arm

84
00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:16,030
and it's the idea that every single

85
00:05:16,030 --> 00:05:19,410
citizen can and maybe

86
00:05:19,410 --> 00:05:23,660
has 20 I love 0 on every single issue
that's presented

87
00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:26,889
are now in the Greek Senate for example
that

88
00:05:26,889 --> 00:05:29,900
is a significant bar arsonists in

89
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:33,850
art for the Roman Empire for the greeks

90
00:05:33,850 --> 00:05:36,870
these are very limited social classes

91
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:40,560
a quasi aristocratic are

92
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:43,669
most people we're not necessarily
citizens

93
00:05:43,669 --> 00:05:47,930
most people can't bear the duties of
this are and they're also just practical

94
00:05:47,930 --> 00:05:49,979
limitations so for example

95
00:05:49,979 --> 00:05:53,659
you can't get a million people in one
room

96
00:05:53,660 --> 00:05:57,400
let alone have them all have a
reasonable discussion about what

97
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:59,280
policies to have

98
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:02,340
let alone if you're using sorta

99
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:08,310
are the discussion moderation practices
that are really appropriate for direct

100
00:06:08,310 --> 00:06:10,460
democracies are small communities like

101
00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:15,570
a consensus-based approach where strict
consensus and anyone can block

102
00:06:15,570 --> 00:06:20,389
that breaks when you get above on the
order of 30 people

103
00:06:20,389 --> 00:06:23,509
are because somebody starts process
wrong

104
00:06:23,509 --> 00:06:27,410
arm there are also just limitations

105
00:06:27,410 --> 00:06:30,470
I'll letter server pragmatic on the

106
00:06:30,470 --> 00:06:34,949
on the individual cuz not everybody is
the time the interest

107
00:06:34,949 --> 00:06:38,050
or the expertise to participate in every
single ship

108
00:06:38,050 --> 00:06:41,850
arm and you have problems a turnout

109
00:06:41,850 --> 00:06:44,940
arm people are not even like

110
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:48,320
a great turnout in the United States arm

111
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:51,500
for one election a year

112
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:54,780
is what percentage of the population

113
00:06:54,780 --> 00:06:58,840
right 30

114
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:01,949
if you're lucky and that's for one

115
00:07:01,949 --> 00:07:08,270
one-vote are let alone if you're talking
actually writing the Legislature on it

116
00:07:08,270 --> 00:07:11,659
where you have votes every single day
your votes on

117
00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:14,660
specialized things your vote on general
things

118
00:07:14,660 --> 00:07:18,220
it that's never gonna arm

119
00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:22,060
and another issue is sorted related to
that which is participation

120
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:27,340
is a privilege of class are the people
who can afford to go to a PTA meeting

121
00:07:27,340 --> 00:07:31,940
who can afford to take time out of their
lives to go to a city council meeting

122
00:07:31,940 --> 00:07:35,960
and sit through a couple hours a boring
ass

123
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:39,479
procedural stuff before they can give
their thing about what they want to get

124
00:07:39,479 --> 00:07:40,520
done

125
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:45,430
are highly privileged people or people
who are taking a very significant

126
00:07:45,430 --> 00:07:48,490
our personal cost in order to parse p

127
00:07:48,490 --> 00:07:51,789
and I think it's a it's arm serve

128
00:07:51,789 --> 00:07:56,818
it's a congratulatory thing to them that
they're willing to take such high

129
00:07:56,819 --> 00:08:01,289
cost to participate but I don't think
that's reasonable to expect and I don't

130
00:08:01,289 --> 00:08:03,020
think that's how it should work

131
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:07,750
so a compromise that has existed in our
government in many other governments as

132
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:09,870
the representative democracy

133
00:08:09,870 --> 00:08:14,310
are so incentive everybody going to the
senate

134
00:08:14,310 --> 00:08:17,330
you like someone who's gonna go

135
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:20,699
and ride on horseback to the city

136
00:08:20,699 --> 00:08:24,349
i holler to the state's Council

137
00:08:24,349 --> 00:08:28,840
are I got those backwards and I arm and
represent your views for you and you

138
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:29,970
trust them

139
00:08:29,970 --> 00:08:33,560
to to be your advocate and you say okay
you're gonna represent

140
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:37,479
all of us and then you can have 50
people in a room or a

141
00:08:37,479 --> 00:08:42,529
maybe 200 people in a room by not like
all cities people

142
00:08:42,529 --> 00:08:45,989
arm of course this has some problems arm

143
00:08:45,989 --> 00:08:49,779
one is that know when people think about
it

144
00:08:49,779 --> 00:08:53,209
they suffer from the myth %uh like the
sage

145
00:08:53,209 --> 00:08:56,769
representative are where

146
00:08:56,769 --> 00:09:00,910
you know they they think this person is
going to think deeply about the issues

147
00:09:00,910 --> 00:09:03,699
is gonna study every bill and detailing

148
00:09:03,699 --> 00:09:07,149
consider how it's gonna best workout for
the constituents

149
00:09:07,149 --> 00:09:10,319
and that is pure bullshit are

150
00:09:10,319 --> 00:09:13,410
that's not how it works are in modern

151
00:09:13,410 --> 00:09:17,360
US our republic the representatives

152
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:20,470
typically vote in party blocs

153
00:09:20,470 --> 00:09:24,589
are maybe they read all

154
00:09:24,589 --> 00:09:28,529
a couple percent up the bills that
actually come up

155
00:09:28,529 --> 00:09:32,639
and for the rest they distrust her rip
their party to tell them how to vote

156
00:09:32,639 --> 00:09:36,540
or they vote on serb broad ideological
grounds namely

157
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:39,809
the other side propose that therefore
must be back

158
00:09:39,809 --> 00:09:43,129
arm and I don't think this is plausible

159
00:09:43,129 --> 00:09:47,749
and even if you have a representative
who's going above and beyond who's

160
00:09:47,749 --> 00:09:50,929
really committed to being a great
represent

161
00:09:50,929 --> 00:09:53,949
they just hands follow everything

162
00:09:53,949 --> 00:09:58,329
it's not physically possible they cannot
be an expert on every single issue

163
00:09:58,329 --> 00:10:01,619
even people whose full-time job it is to
be

164
00:10:01,619 --> 00:10:05,720
policy wonks they have one domain

165
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:10,129
maybe two if they're crazy but not every

166
00:10:10,129 --> 00:10:13,829
arianna representatives haz would being
along on everything it's just not

167
00:10:13,829 --> 00:10:15,170
sustainable

168
00:10:15,170 --> 00:10:18,809
arm and I think

169
00:10:18,809 --> 00:10:22,249
sometimes even find that some of them
are outright hostile I'll

170
00:10:22,249 --> 00:10:25,709
to the idea being informed like I don't
know how many have you saw the sober

171
00:10:25,709 --> 00:10:26,749
people a

172
00:10:26,749 --> 00:10:30,369
I hearings I where one of the

173
00:10:30,369 --> 00:10:34,839
were one other people deciding on the
future of the Internet

174
00:10:34,839 --> 00:10:38,809
is basically openly mocking the idea

175
00:10:38,809 --> 00:10:42,319
I love knowing a lot about computers

176
00:10:42,319 --> 00:10:46,519
are and this is the person whose task it
is to decide

177
00:10:46,519 --> 00:10:52,129
what the policy should be and what the
policy should be for like DNS

178
00:10:52,129 --> 00:10:56,980
service and doesn't know how do you know
service works and doesn't realize how

179
00:10:56,980 --> 00:10:58,899
doing this is gonna break DNS

180
00:10:58,899 --> 00:11:03,119
sakin is gonna break all these other
things it's a problem

181
00:11:03,119 --> 00:11:06,899
arm another aspect to the problem is
that

182
00:11:06,899 --> 00:11:11,629
arm what is intended to be a a way for
them to be

183
00:11:11,629 --> 00:11:14,679
isolated from you know the whims

184
00:11:14,679 --> 00:11:19,369
I love the general population where
supposedly they're going to be

185
00:11:19,369 --> 00:11:22,439
arsov in office and

186
00:11:22,439 --> 00:11:27,139
they get a couple years so that they are
not gonna be swayed to all the

187
00:11:27,139 --> 00:11:31,360
politics day to random fads

188
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:34,929
is faults are at least now

189
00:11:34,929 --> 00:11:39,779
I if anything politicians have a maximum
future outlook

190
00:11:39,779 --> 00:11:43,480
all four years to their next election

191
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:47,739
right maybe six if you're in senate arm

192
00:11:47,739 --> 00:11:51,299
and you don't get generally politicians
thinking

193
00:11:51,299 --> 00:11:55,329
what is the impact on this policy gonna
be in fifty years

194
00:11:55,329 --> 00:11:58,480
even if it's a sacrifice in the law in
the next couple years

195
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:01,829
why because they're going to be running
for reelection

196
00:12:01,829 --> 00:12:05,160
are in a couple years and thats

197
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:08,290
their clits they've got impressed by
that point and if something is a longer

198
00:12:08,290 --> 00:12:09,368
term policy

199
00:12:09,369 --> 00:12:13,499
they lose and so you get shorter term
decision make

200
00:12:13,499 --> 00:12:16,999
arm you also get a problem with the

201
00:12:16,999 --> 00:12:21,259
a subversion and who they represent so
right now the best

202
00:12:21,259 --> 00:12:25,829
best-case scenario is you have a
politician who represents

203
00:12:25,829 --> 00:12:30,480
roughly 52 to 60 percent

204
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:34,249
on the voters in their district are the
ones who voted for them

205
00:12:34,249 --> 00:12:37,290
the reso them tough shit right

206
00:12:37,290 --> 00:12:40,920
arm your vote is being used your your

207
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:44,248
no representation is being used to
support the things you'd

208
00:12:44,249 --> 00:12:48,069
directly oppose and you can't do
anything about

209
00:12:48,069 --> 00:12:52,368
arm now make your loss tries to

210
00:12:52,369 --> 00:12:56,889
arm tries to change is the our goals are
really pretty simple in its

211
00:12:56,889 --> 00:13:01,139
in the name we want to help you make
your loss

212
00:13:01,139 --> 00:13:04,369
arm now they're a few ways we can do
this um

213
00:13:04,369 --> 00:13:07,499
one is an answer to the democratic

214
00:13:07,499 --> 00:13:10,779
and Republic forms a government which is
called a liquid democracy

215
00:13:10,779 --> 00:13:14,799
it's also called a direct democracy with
transferable proxy it's also calling

216
00:13:14,799 --> 00:13:16,739
delegate to have democracy

217
00:13:16,739 --> 00:13:20,290
we prefer the term liquid democracy arm

218
00:13:20,290 --> 00:13:24,769
a little democracy is are a system where
every single voter

219
00:13:24,769 --> 00:13:28,100
can vote on every single issue if they
want they have all the powers that they

220
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:30,040
would have an indirect marks

221
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:33,959
however they also have the power to
proxy the road to someone else

222
00:13:33,959 --> 00:13:37,629
and that person has approx at the power
to proxy it further

223
00:13:37,629 --> 00:13:41,019
and so on and so on arm the first person

224
00:13:41,019 --> 00:13:44,949
in this proxy chain to actually votes
gets to use your vote

225
00:13:44,949 --> 00:13:49,389
arm you can also split your votes among
multiple people at the same tier

226
00:13:49,389 --> 00:13:53,839
so for example if you trust to people
equally the both get half a vote

227
00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:57,899
I for one of them does vote a golden the
one gets a full vote

228
00:13:57,899 --> 00:14:01,079
are if you're representing now five
hundred votes than

229
00:14:01,079 --> 00:14:04,189
250 250 are you can also

230
00:14:04,189 --> 00:14:07,259
limit them by category so for example
maybe

231
00:14:07,259 --> 00:14:11,109
you trust your friend bob to be really
knowledgeable about

232
00:14:11,109 --> 00:14:15,139
gun issues and to protect your right to
have a concealed firearm

233
00:14:15,139 --> 00:14:18,819
but you don't wanna voting for you about
abortion rights arm

234
00:14:18,819 --> 00:14:22,230
its entirely plausible scenario we will
let you do that

235
00:14:22,230 --> 00:14:26,009
are wanted one scenario for how this
chain would work is suppose that you

236
00:14:26,009 --> 00:14:28,299
don't really follow politics that much

237
00:14:28,299 --> 00:14:31,379
your values that you one representative
but you

238
00:14:31,379 --> 00:14:34,749
don't have the time so you could park
see your vote

239
00:14:34,749 --> 00:14:38,549
entirely too I you're close friend house

240
00:14:38,549 --> 00:14:43,049
who does follow politics arm now alice
is not a policy walk for say she just

241
00:14:43,049 --> 00:14:43,858
knows

242
00:14:43,859 --> 00:14:46,879
so she follows the news she knows who
the players in the field are

243
00:14:46,879 --> 00:14:50,049
so she in turn proxies your vote and
hers

244
00:14:50,049 --> 00:14:53,230
to the ACLU for civil rights to

245
00:14:53,230 --> 00:14:56,549
the American Medical Association for
medical issues

246
00:14:56,549 --> 00:14:59,679
to the NRA for gun issues and so forth

247
00:14:59,679 --> 00:15:03,689
are maybe to some popular bloggers who
are like for women's rights issue

248
00:15:03,689 --> 00:15:04,589
specifically

249
00:15:04,589 --> 00:15:07,850
at center arm they in turn so

250
00:15:07,850 --> 00:15:12,869
the ACLU for example has lawyers are and
legislative analysts

251
00:15:12,869 --> 00:15:16,179
and the ACLU is a body proxies their
votes

252
00:15:16,179 --> 00:15:19,929
to some specific expert on some very
narrow topic

253
00:15:19,929 --> 00:15:24,179
arm and then that expert gets aggregate
all these votes in

254
00:15:24,179 --> 00:15:27,389
and use them on a given issue arm

255
00:15:27,389 --> 00:15:30,809
so these proxies are essentially trust
relationships

256
00:15:30,809 --> 00:15:34,299
arm now there are some security
properties that need to be present

257
00:15:34,299 --> 00:15:38,169
in them are at least for the purposes of
voting per side there's

258
00:15:38,169 --> 00:15:42,160
an exceptional get to in a bit %ah which
is that these proxies are one-way

259
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:43,238
private

260
00:15:43,239 --> 00:15:48,019
so you know how your proxy voted

261
00:15:48,019 --> 00:15:52,329
but your proxy does not know who you are
are they know

262
00:15:52,329 --> 00:15:56,319
in aggregate how many people they
represent with some fathers to prevent

263
00:15:56,319 --> 00:15:57,059
like timing

264
00:15:57,059 --> 00:16:00,799
attacks arm but they don't know like

265
00:16:00,799 --> 00:16:03,989
any given person for proxy to them

266
00:16:03,989 --> 00:16:07,989
and %ah proxies are generally gonna be
public proxies so

267
00:16:07,989 --> 00:16:13,319
I to get the power to be like publicly
listed as a proxy

268
00:16:13,319 --> 00:16:16,959
to more visibility things like that they
give up the price privacy of their

269
00:16:16,959 --> 00:16:17,549
booked

270
00:16:17,549 --> 00:16:21,169
at least on the issues that they proxy
they can also have a separate

271
00:16:21,169 --> 00:16:25,049
a place where they product they can you
know do their other stuff they don't

272
00:16:25,049 --> 00:16:25,429
want

273
00:16:25,429 --> 00:16:29,119
don't want to be public about that's fun
arm and in turn anyone

274
00:16:29,119 --> 00:16:32,959
that a public proxy proxies to has to
also be public

275
00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:37,100
right once its public ask arm

276
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:41,910
the use up your vote is also always
something that you can review and

277
00:16:41,910 --> 00:16:43,160
override

278
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:46,238
so if someone uses your approach

279
00:16:46,239 --> 00:16:50,709
you get a notification %ah that cannot
happen

280
00:16:50,709 --> 00:16:54,709
more than are less than a week before
final deadline

281
00:16:54,709 --> 00:16:59,359
so if your proxy decides to you know use
your vote on some given issue

282
00:16:59,359 --> 00:17:02,829
we send you an email and say this is how
your proxy voted

283
00:17:02,829 --> 00:17:06,360
are you authorize to vote that that way
by default

284
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:10,299
I and if you want to you can override if
you think you know this isn't

285
00:17:10,299 --> 00:17:14,730
what I signed up for or you know i i
agree with them generally gone this one

286
00:17:14,730 --> 00:17:16,509
what the hell were they thinking

287
00:17:16,509 --> 00:17:19,779
of or if you just want to review it you
cut I

288
00:17:19,779 --> 00:17:23,980
So Eun you never give up power resin
representative system

289
00:17:23,980 --> 00:17:27,549
you give it up you vote for senator bob

290
00:17:27,549 --> 00:17:31,779
Bob gets to make your decisions for the
next couple years

291
00:17:31,779 --> 00:17:36,039
whether you like it or not you can you
don't get to do anything with it

292
00:17:36,039 --> 00:17:39,740
arm there's also difference enough vote

293
00:17:39,740 --> 00:17:45,220
origination so for example eyes as I
said only voters get a vote per set so

294
00:17:45,220 --> 00:17:50,750
are in order to get a one unit a vote
you have to prove to us that you are

295
00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:54,659
a human being %ah who is a unique human

296
00:17:54,659 --> 00:17:59,250
was legal I identity that is permitted
to vote

297
00:17:59,250 --> 00:18:03,580
arm however I worked fine with you
having pseudonyms

298
00:18:03,580 --> 00:18:07,460
are you have synonymous accounts however
the hell man you want

299
00:18:07,460 --> 00:18:11,350
arm they don't have to be tied to your
legal name they can be if you want in

300
00:18:11,350 --> 00:18:14,070
which case are not synonymous there to
screen names

301
00:18:14,070 --> 00:18:18,299
arm but your synonymous accounts

302
00:18:18,299 --> 00:18:22,950
do not get a vote have their own they
can proxy for others however

303
00:18:22,950 --> 00:18:26,309
so are if you want to have a pseudonym

304
00:18:26,309 --> 00:18:30,730
that's going to be serving active
political activist on something that

305
00:18:30,730 --> 00:18:32,730
maybe you don't want it I to your

306
00:18:32,730 --> 00:18:37,100
legal identity for Social Research use
like your closet Republican for example

307
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:40,269
on your speaking out on gay rights

308
00:18:40,269 --> 00:18:43,730
arm that's a great example where you
wanna pseudonym

309
00:18:43,730 --> 00:18:47,309
I it's just find that you're talking
about it

310
00:18:47,309 --> 00:18:51,059
arm it's just that if you want to be
able to vote on something you have to

311
00:18:51,059 --> 00:18:52,230
convince other people did

312
00:18:52,230 --> 00:18:56,019
give them give you your vote and this
also prevents sock puppets because

313
00:18:56,019 --> 00:18:59,029
it's one vote per person that means it's
one

314
00:18:59,029 --> 00:19:02,769
maximum I love one participating

315
00:19:02,769 --> 00:19:06,190
account her discussion per human

316
00:19:06,190 --> 00:19:10,529
who's involved so if you wanna crate n
sock puppets accounts

317
00:19:10,529 --> 00:19:15,299
most of them are going to have 0 votes
so hookers no get filtered by default

318
00:19:15,299 --> 00:19:18,549
arm now

319
00:19:18,549 --> 00:19:23,139
there's I am one split insert how

320
00:19:23,139 --> 00:19:26,250
proxies I would

321
00:19:26,250 --> 00:19:31,789
specialized so there's arm there's a
couple different roles at approxi- plays

322
00:19:31,789 --> 00:19:34,799
one roll is to be a policy walk

323
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:40,429
to participate in in-depth discussions
about what should be the policies

324
00:19:40,429 --> 00:19:43,610
I wanted the factual background of
things

325
00:19:43,610 --> 00:19:47,019
et cetera and not necessarily now being
a great public

326
00:19:47,019 --> 00:19:50,519
communicator %ah if they're both that's
great but

327
00:19:50,519 --> 00:19:54,090
you know really knowing their shit on
some particular policy so people can

328
00:19:54,090 --> 00:19:54,980
trust their

329
00:19:54,980 --> 00:19:59,409
opinions on that edge another role
however is a public advocate

330
00:19:59,409 --> 00:20:03,580
is as someone who is a generalist who
finds

331
00:20:03,580 --> 00:20:06,820
those specialists and knows why they can
be trusted

332
00:20:06,820 --> 00:20:11,009
and can help explain their ID's the
general world who can help convince

333
00:20:11,009 --> 00:20:14,830
other advocates to change their
positions on issues

334
00:20:14,830 --> 00:20:18,110
ought to be sort of an advocate for
their constituency and

335
00:20:18,110 --> 00:20:22,230
to their constituency because remember
that in this system

336
00:20:22,230 --> 00:20:25,480
arm you'll immediately lose your power

337
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:30,429
if are anyway if people lose faith in
you there's no no confidence vote

338
00:20:30,429 --> 00:20:33,960
your always under a no confidence vote

339
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:37,019
so if you want to retain your power you
have to make sure your constituents back

340
00:20:37,019 --> 00:20:37,830
you

341
00:20:37,830 --> 00:20:41,620
if you wanna change her mind on
something that's great I if you change

342
00:20:41,620 --> 00:20:44,679
your mind on an issue I think that's
something that actually is a very

343
00:20:44,679 --> 00:20:47,610
interesting case we should consider that
flip-flopping

344
00:20:47,610 --> 00:20:51,600
are if someone has you know changer my
like one

345
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:55,779
prominent advocate above against gay
marriage for are non-religious reasons

346
00:20:55,779 --> 00:20:57,049
for several reasons

347
00:20:57,049 --> 00:21:00,679
he recently came out in favor of gay
marriage I and I think this is an

348
00:21:00,679 --> 00:21:02,179
example of

349
00:21:02,179 --> 00:21:06,429
are someone who can really speak better

350
00:21:06,429 --> 00:21:09,580
then people who have always been for gay
marriage

351
00:21:09,580 --> 00:21:13,549
to the people who are against it RN vice
versa happens

352
00:21:13,549 --> 00:21:16,730
arm so these people reserve in the edges

353
00:21:16,730 --> 00:21:20,279
are more effective communicators and
that's part of the job a really good

354
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:21,620
proxy

355
00:21:21,620 --> 00:21:25,350
arm so

356
00:21:25,350 --> 00:21:29,539
yet so there's a strategy that we have

357
00:21:29,539 --> 00:21:32,940
about going about so as as I said if we
relied on

358
00:21:32,940 --> 00:21:36,320
politicians to let us do this it would
never happen

359
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:39,789
I N you may have seen other talks are
other I

360
00:21:39,789 --> 00:21:44,000
years where the premises well first
we're going to get this constitutional

361
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,610
amendment passed

362
00:21:45,610 --> 00:21:48,919
are and then things will be great I or

363
00:21:48,919 --> 00:21:52,269
first we're gonna vote everybody out of
office

364
00:21:52,269 --> 00:21:55,919
and that's not going to happen arm

365
00:21:55,919 --> 00:22:00,909
so our strategy is we're gonna start
small perhaps

366
00:22:00,909 --> 00:22:04,039
for gonna start so that we always have

367
00:22:04,039 --> 00:22:08,279
teeth up so you're probably familiar
with the

368
00:22:08,279 --> 00:22:13,240
like survey sites and petition cites are
the white house runs one

369
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:16,879
where you can log on and you can say
what

370
00:22:16,879 --> 00:22:20,509
you should do axe of a new sign your
name to it

371
00:22:20,509 --> 00:22:24,539
and the most you can expect out of it

372
00:22:24,539 --> 00:22:27,740
for 99 percent of cases at least is

373
00:22:27,740 --> 00:22:31,480
they say thank you very much fuck off

374
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:34,610
I accepting say that in much more polite
terms

375
00:22:34,610 --> 00:22:39,049
that is spun nicely to appeal to people
or at least not seem as if they're

376
00:22:39,049 --> 00:22:40,168
telling it to fuck off

377
00:22:40,169 --> 00:22:42,870
but basically that's the ideal es of
course they were going to do it anyway

378
00:22:42,870 --> 00:22:43,710
which they could

379
00:22:43,710 --> 00:22:48,370
in which case they say look at our
responsiveness to our electorate

380
00:22:48,370 --> 00:22:52,340
arm so take a look at for example a very
popular petition

381
00:22:52,340 --> 00:22:56,379
on white houses are petition site was a
policy about

382
00:22:56,379 --> 00:22:59,759
marijuana and of course the White House

383
00:22:59,759 --> 00:23:04,169
did not respond positively to that
despite a very large support

384
00:23:04,169 --> 00:23:08,039
arm so I think that kinda balls

385
00:23:08,039 --> 00:23:11,658
are and I think its a waste a people's
time

386
00:23:11,659 --> 00:23:15,389
it burns people out when they've already
burnt out

387
00:23:15,389 --> 00:23:19,289
a lot have trust in the political
process and you need

388
00:23:19,289 --> 00:23:23,279
real teeth to accomplish what you want
so we have a few

389
00:23:23,279 --> 00:23:27,570
highly tooth fall weighs about so

390
00:23:27,570 --> 00:23:31,220
one which is what I'm working on right
now an answer that the first thing just

391
00:23:31,220 --> 00:23:32,299
because I've timing

392
00:23:32,299 --> 00:23:35,809
are you might no what month this is I

393
00:23:35,809 --> 00:23:39,580
is campaign finance I so

394
00:23:39,580 --> 00:23:45,289
right now a lot of interest I are paid
for by wealthy corporations are wealthy

395
00:23:45,289 --> 00:23:47,259
individuals who finance

396
00:23:47,259 --> 00:23:50,919
our political campaigns or who finance
voter initiatives

397
00:23:50,919 --> 00:23:54,620
arm that's great for promoting their
interests but I don't think it's great

398
00:23:54,620 --> 00:23:56,580
for promoting yours

399
00:23:56,580 --> 00:23:59,960
are and there's a collective action
problem which is

400
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:05,080
you might have you know 50 bucks to lay
down on some ish

401
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:08,350
and 50 bucks alone isn't gonna cut arm

402
00:24:08,350 --> 00:24:12,210
however if you and a thousand have your
friends

403
00:24:12,210 --> 00:24:15,809
are in your network lay down fifty bucks
on an issue

404
00:24:15,809 --> 00:24:18,870
that we're starting to talk about
serious

405
00:24:18,870 --> 00:24:22,470
money are I don't know if you look
through

406
00:24:22,470 --> 00:24:26,929
amount of money that packs contribute to
various things are if you gotta I think

407
00:24:26,929 --> 00:24:30,870
opensecrets.org is is the 1 I'm thinking
of its right to him

408
00:24:30,870 --> 00:24:34,940
ever really good breakdown of how
various entities spend money

409
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:38,169
it's not as high as you might think arm

410
00:24:38,169 --> 00:24:41,340
except for independent expenditures but
I'll get to that

411
00:24:41,340 --> 00:24:45,730
arm so that's one aspect arm and there's
a lot of things that we can do to

412
00:24:45,730 --> 00:24:49,590
to added pressure to it so for example

413
00:24:49,590 --> 00:24:54,120
are we could do what's called an your
mark are so generally if you give us

414
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:54,749
money is

415
00:24:54,749 --> 00:24:58,330
I I say us I we r a job

416
00:24:58,330 --> 00:25:01,949
a triad of non-profit corporations a 501
c3

417
00:25:01,950 --> 00:25:05,269
which is what you probably normally
think of as a general nonprofit

418
00:25:05,269 --> 00:25:08,659
tax-deductible contributions and all
that

419
00:25:08,659 --> 00:25:14,100
a 501 c4 are also called advocacy
organization sometimes very loosely

420
00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:15,340
called the super PAC

421
00:25:15,340 --> 00:25:18,730
it is not a super PAC up by formal
definition

422
00:25:18,730 --> 00:25:22,350
are those organizations are the ones you
typically see sponsoring ballot

423
00:25:22,350 --> 00:25:23,249
initiatives

424
00:25:23,249 --> 00:25:27,149
I and things like that they're also the
ones that you see

425
00:25:27,149 --> 00:25:30,460
are being the anonymous shell
corporation that forwards

426
00:25:30,460 --> 00:25:33,690
are Carl rose wealthy contributors money

427
00:25:33,690 --> 00:25:37,399
to his super PAC outcomes are not
required to report donations and I'll

428
00:25:37,399 --> 00:25:38,700
get to that number

429
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:41,720
and finally we have a 527 hybrid super
PAC

430
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:46,809
are which is the you know the fall
formal thing has a report

431
00:25:46,809 --> 00:25:52,049
all ivory this so arm

432
00:25:52,049 --> 00:25:55,240
so you can you can donate to any of
these various things if you want to

433
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:57,289
donate to a politician for example

434
00:25:57,289 --> 00:26:02,460
and you tell our pack I want to donate
50 bucks to bob for congress

435
00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:06,190
we are required to hand it over to bob
for Congress Committee

436
00:26:06,190 --> 00:26:10,720
in 10 days legally are RO 11 CFR 1 10 6

437
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:13,990
wanna look it up arm yes I've been

438
00:26:13,990 --> 00:26:17,269
reading regulation six that's re-supply

439
00:26:17,269 --> 00:26:22,049
I so one thing we could add to this and
this is actually part iv:

440
00:26:22,049 --> 00:26:26,158
a a opinion um going to be asking I love
the FEC

441
00:26:26,159 --> 00:26:29,230
because it's not entirely clear
currently is

442
00:26:29,230 --> 00:26:34,379
I we could say so you remember sober
people how that all went down

443
00:26:34,379 --> 00:26:38,350
so we could say suppose that sober is on
the table

444
00:26:38,350 --> 00:26:42,249
are and you want to donate fifty dollars
to oppose soap

445
00:26:42,249 --> 00:26:45,809
but you don't know how you're your
representatives gonna vote

446
00:26:45,809 --> 00:26:49,379
so you could tell us only give fifty
dollars to

447
00:26:49,379 --> 00:26:52,379
my representative if they vote again CO

448
00:26:52,379 --> 00:26:56,169
sober and I wanna donated to their
opponent

449
00:26:56,169 --> 00:26:59,840
if they vote in favor this is a your
mark

450
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:03,590
it's a contingent your mark which the
FEC has previously ruled is

451
00:27:03,590 --> 00:27:07,159
acceptable in certain circumstances at
least arm

452
00:27:07,159 --> 00:27:10,970
and then we could publicly say okay we
have this much money on the table

453
00:27:10,970 --> 00:27:14,360
I for this outcome these are who will
get what

454
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:18,629
if that that happens and this is who
will get what if the other thing happens

455
00:27:18,629 --> 00:27:21,799
i think is a a bit of a lever

456
00:27:21,799 --> 00:27:26,029
I shall we say for getting people to
vote the way you want

457
00:27:26,029 --> 00:27:29,919
arm another wave that we can influence
things

458
00:27:29,919 --> 00:27:33,070
is through voter initiative to right now
I don't know if

459
00:27:33,070 --> 00:27:36,509
you experience this but voter
initiatives are signed by literally

460
00:27:36,509 --> 00:27:38,499
people on the street

461
00:27:38,499 --> 00:27:43,179
collecting signatures on a clipboard
they get a dollar to four dollars ahead

462
00:27:43,179 --> 00:27:47,470
are and is a really expensive process we
can do this online

463
00:27:47,470 --> 00:27:51,019
are there are some legal obstacles are
because of how the whale

464
00:27:51,019 --> 00:27:54,360
the laws are written but there are ways
around them were hackers we can think of

465
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:55,860
creative solutions to

466
00:27:55,860 --> 00:28:00,139
poorly written code arm

467
00:28:00,139 --> 00:28:03,869
so for example personally affects in
California

468
00:28:03,869 --> 00:28:06,980
turns out to be a problematic think arm

469
00:28:06,980 --> 00:28:11,929
weekend do things that serve work
together with politicians to provide a

470
00:28:11,929 --> 00:28:14,369
carrot and a stick so the carrot of
course

471
00:28:14,369 --> 00:28:18,249
is are money for your political campaign

472
00:28:18,249 --> 00:28:21,759
are information about your constituents
who will be

473
00:28:21,759 --> 00:28:26,059
pleased to vote for you I M will
dedicate

474
00:28:26,059 --> 00:28:29,379
are themselves to getting people to vote
for you

475
00:28:29,379 --> 00:28:32,679
if you obey their wishes shocking idea I
know

476
00:28:32,679 --> 00:28:36,700
but arm might happen arm

477
00:28:36,700 --> 00:28:40,110
and so these are sir to pass

478
00:28:40,110 --> 00:28:43,759
eventually what it will lead to is our
having dedicated

479
00:28:43,759 --> 00:28:47,610
representatives who just say I'm going
to

480
00:28:47,610 --> 00:28:52,429
you know try to advocate to you but
ultimately I will obey whatever you guys

481
00:28:52,429 --> 00:28:53,299
but

482
00:28:53,299 --> 00:28:56,629
are and now this may seem far-fetched

483
00:28:56,629 --> 00:29:00,330
but actually there are currently two
politicians running for office

484
00:29:00,330 --> 00:29:03,490
are on this platform I one

485
00:29:03,490 --> 00:29:06,899
is Jeremy Hanson are in vermont

486
00:29:06,899 --> 00:29:11,340
who's running for state Senate are the
other is filled ought in florida who's

487
00:29:11,340 --> 00:29:12,929
running for US Senate

488
00:29:12,929 --> 00:29:17,070
I heard i think is the Germany might be
running for state representative

489
00:29:17,070 --> 00:29:20,289
I'm forgetting that sorry arm

490
00:29:20,289 --> 00:29:25,389
so it's not unheard it's possible and we
are working with these guys to build a

491
00:29:25,389 --> 00:29:26,830
system for them

492
00:29:26,830 --> 00:29:30,960
arm so our principles are a little bit
different than the principles of our

493
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:32,970
users necessarily because we want to
reach

494
00:29:32,970 --> 00:29:36,029
everybody so we unlike our users

495
00:29:36,029 --> 00:29:40,059
are very strictly non parts so if you
wanna pass

496
00:29:40,059 --> 00:29:43,320
a bill that says I like gay couples

497
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:47,689
I should have to pay taxes and may not
get married and may not have health care

498
00:29:47,690 --> 00:29:49,990
and may not have visitation rights

499
00:29:49,990 --> 00:29:53,129
okay are will help you pass

500
00:29:53,129 --> 00:29:56,369
I if you wanna pass are the opposite

501
00:29:56,369 --> 00:30:01,720
and say you know I insurance for gay
people is mandatory

502
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:06,129
and they must be allowed to marry and so
forth great we'll help you pass out to

503
00:30:06,129 --> 00:30:09,669
how effective he'll be a passing it will
reflect not

504
00:30:09,669 --> 00:30:15,629
our beliefs but how effective you are at
convincing people to support your policy

505
00:30:15,629 --> 00:30:18,940
and so this way we can we can remain
neutral to things that aren't

506
00:30:18,940 --> 00:30:22,350
directly part about our own goals

507
00:30:22,350 --> 00:30:26,950
however we do have got so for instance
you're entitled to your opinion

508
00:30:26,950 --> 00:30:29,850
and you're entitled to try to make
losses for your opinion you're not

509
00:30:29,850 --> 00:30:31,769
entitled to your own facts

510
00:30:31,769 --> 00:30:35,200
so if you make a factual empirical
statement on our website we reserve the

511
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:36,740
rights to redline it

512
00:30:36,740 --> 00:30:40,889
for FactCheck if you make opposition
statement that's just follow

513
00:30:40,889 --> 00:30:46,379
factual errors not we disagree strongly
with your police but factual errors

514
00:30:46,379 --> 00:30:50,639
will put a fact-check meter next that
will not be under your control that will

515
00:30:50,639 --> 00:30:52,929
be under independent review

516
00:30:52,929 --> 00:30:58,110
arm we need to care about security and
privacy so for example were identifying

517
00:30:58,110 --> 00:30:59,749
people's legal identities

518
00:30:59,749 --> 00:31:03,869
others ways to do this in relatively
secure fashions

519
00:31:03,869 --> 00:31:08,350
we still need stored securely others
could togher fee involved in being able

520
00:31:08,350 --> 00:31:09,139
to publish

521
00:31:09,139 --> 00:31:12,299
a publicly verifiable

522
00:31:12,299 --> 00:31:16,408
proof of how people voted in the
aggregate that doesn't let you

523
00:31:16,409 --> 00:31:20,830
determine how people voted in a given
our particular situation

524
00:31:20,830 --> 00:31:23,908
arm and I we're committed to being
transparent so

525
00:31:23,909 --> 00:31:29,059
entirely open-source I accept world were
like prohibited by contractor law are

526
00:31:29,059 --> 00:31:29,668
some balls

527
00:31:29,669 --> 00:31:33,909
like that arm and nonprofit as well

528
00:31:33,909 --> 00:31:37,149
so we might have salaries for instance

529
00:31:37,149 --> 00:31:41,580
if you're working full time but we're
not we don't have shareholders were not

530
00:31:41,580 --> 00:31:43,090
trying to make money

531
00:31:43,090 --> 00:31:46,610
for people were just running get shit
done

532
00:31:46,610 --> 00:31:51,659
arm so there are some very interesting
problems to solve

533
00:31:51,659 --> 00:31:54,679
in doing this arm so

534
00:31:54,679 --> 00:31:58,679
one thing I should preface this with is
are

535
00:31:58,679 --> 00:32:03,940
I guess managing your expectations a bit
this is not gonna be a perfect system

536
00:32:03,940 --> 00:32:08,499
arm my aim humble as it is

537
00:32:08,499 --> 00:32:13,799
is to be better in every way than the
current system

538
00:32:13,799 --> 00:32:17,639
I think that's enough arm but some
people

539
00:32:17,639 --> 00:32:22,379
think you know well it has this flaw my
response is always going to be

540
00:32:22,379 --> 00:32:26,100
does it have a flaw that is worse than
the current system

541
00:32:26,100 --> 00:32:29,570
if yes I consider that a very serious
concern

542
00:32:29,570 --> 00:32:33,739
if no I think it's something to optimize
but not a killer

543
00:32:33,739 --> 00:32:37,409
I obviously if you think of any flaws we
can optimize I mean

544
00:32:37,409 --> 00:32:41,889
arm

545
00:32:41,889 --> 00:32:48,889
louder

546
00:32:51,570 --> 00:32:56,030
arm all I think all address a couple of
them

547
00:32:56,030 --> 00:33:03,030
I N if I don't please let me know

548
00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:12,370
right arm so that there aren't so

549
00:33:12,370 --> 00:33:15,950
how do you categorize laws so that
people can do category limitations

550
00:33:15,950 --> 00:33:19,650
there's actually a couple proposal were
considering about that one is we can

551
00:33:19,650 --> 00:33:20,520
just do that

552
00:33:20,520 --> 00:33:24,190
ourselves are because we're committed to
being nonpartisan

553
00:33:24,190 --> 00:33:28,660
at after work sort of a neutral party
another thing we could do is

554
00:33:28,660 --> 00:33:33,040
allow third parties to categorize things
a certain categorization services

555
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:36,678
and then you can subscribe to their
categorization service and

556
00:33:36,679 --> 00:33:39,720
you can trust whoever you want to
categorize things hard

557
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:43,059
I but we be the default rust arm

558
00:33:43,059 --> 00:33:46,639
let's a matter I'm I'm happy to talk
about but it's a bit

559
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:49,650
it's a bit detailed arm so

560
00:33:49,650 --> 00:33:53,530
one issue in for example is are the

561
00:33:53,530 --> 00:33:56,590
is online voting so somethings

562
00:33:56,590 --> 00:34:01,559
are private so for example like I said
your vote itself should be Ford prop

563
00:34:01,559 --> 00:34:05,440
some things are not private and we will
not pretend that their pride

564
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:09,940
so for example if you donate money to a
campaign we are mandated by law

565
00:34:09,940 --> 00:34:13,590
to disclose that I think we're also
managed by ethics

566
00:34:13,590 --> 00:34:17,440
to disclose at even if it's below the
the standard that the Glock currently

567
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:18,750
requires us to do

568
00:34:18,750 --> 00:34:23,500
we would do anyway unless you
specifically ask us not to and to rid to

569
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:24,480
make you a nice

570
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:28,050
I we would respect that to the extent
that were able to

571
00:34:28,050 --> 00:34:31,389
but by default we need to be open about

572
00:34:31,389 --> 00:34:35,570
things like money transfer of and things
like how proxies

573
00:34:35,570 --> 00:34:38,840
Bay I we need to have I

574
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:42,649
verified identity now this is a complex
problem %uh I should point that

575
00:34:42,649 --> 00:34:46,330
all these ballpoint I'm mentioning here
these are foale projects

576
00:34:46,330 --> 00:34:49,710
unto themselves so identity verification

577
00:34:49,710 --> 00:34:53,960
are one method I've been talking
recently with experience I what they

578
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:54,830
have is a

579
00:34:54,830 --> 00:34:58,660
giant fucking database up everything you
have ever done

580
00:34:58,660 --> 00:35:01,868
pretty much are and what they can do is

581
00:35:01,869 --> 00:35:05,740
sell to us I had about a buck 50 a pop
are

582
00:35:05,740 --> 00:35:10,369
a list of key questions I'll there are
multiple choice for you to answer

583
00:35:10,369 --> 00:35:13,740
we show those questions to you you
answer them

584
00:35:13,740 --> 00:35:17,170
we give them back the answers back to
experience along with the name and

585
00:35:17,170 --> 00:35:18,200
address you told us

586
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:22,369
and they tell us are you the person you
claim to be

587
00:35:22,369 --> 00:35:26,710
are who else are might be a plausible

588
00:35:26,710 --> 00:35:30,270
close match like if the name didn't
quite match then they'll tell us

589
00:35:30,270 --> 00:35:33,040
other people they're similar your
address or something so we can manually

590
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:35,410
do that are but in a kiss

591
00:35:35,410 --> 00:35:38,970
it helps prove to a reasonable degree
that you are who you say you r

592
00:35:38,970 --> 00:35:42,260
I'll we can takes can have your are

593
00:35:42,260 --> 00:35:47,070
formal identity like a driver's license
or passport and couple that with like a

594
00:35:47,070 --> 00:35:49,130
webcam love you saying hi my name is

595
00:35:49,130 --> 00:35:52,720
x&i Ind my name my username is why

596
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:56,680
and I intended to do this and you you
can cross correlate their picture on

597
00:35:56,680 --> 00:35:58,839
camera with the picture on the driver's
license

598
00:35:58,840 --> 00:36:02,040
I and there are security issues that I'm
sure your thinking of

599
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:05,050
that's why it's a complicated project
arm

600
00:36:05,050 --> 00:36:08,690
there is the security for cryptographic
proof that I mention so

601
00:36:08,690 --> 00:36:12,100
there's a couple projects that are
working on this one as he leo's

602
00:36:12,100 --> 00:36:15,670
are another in Georgia Khartoum another
is I go to see the honor

603
00:36:15,670 --> 00:36:19,940
arm the problem is you want it
privacy-preserving so you don't know who

604
00:36:19,940 --> 00:36:21,140
voted for what

605
00:36:21,140 --> 00:36:25,379
muster a proxy are eek should be audible
in aggregate

606
00:36:25,380 --> 00:36:29,040
you want people knowing the voter lists
which is not private

607
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:32,259
who participate is up and knowing the
outcome

608
00:36:32,260 --> 00:36:35,740
to be able to prove cryptographically
that you're not lying about

609
00:36:35,740 --> 00:36:41,140
what the totals are and voter verifiable
so the individual should be able to

610
00:36:41,140 --> 00:36:44,520
prove to themselves now if not this
early too other people

611
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:48,150
that their vote was counted the way they
thought shipp

612
00:36:48,150 --> 00:36:51,740
are another thing is proxy honest said
something

613
00:36:51,740 --> 00:36:55,050
people bring up frequently is art

614
00:36:55,050 --> 00:36:58,450
vote trading or selling out arm

615
00:36:58,450 --> 00:37:02,470
now really it's kind of hard to sell out

616
00:37:02,470 --> 00:37:05,800
when people are always inspecting your
votes

617
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:09,140
and always have the power before your
use

618
00:37:09,140 --> 00:37:13,790
up their vote XA fact to nullify it and
overriding just deprive you of your

619
00:37:13,790 --> 00:37:14,540
power

620
00:37:14,540 --> 00:37:18,190
so someone tries to fuck you over their
power just evaporates

621
00:37:18,190 --> 00:37:21,510
useless so kinda changes the incentive
structure

622
00:37:21,510 --> 00:37:24,790
however this can be assisted so for
example we can detect

623
00:37:24,790 --> 00:37:29,390
well the way you voted is anomalous
either with respect to your own behavior

624
00:37:29,390 --> 00:37:32,799
or with respect to other things that
this user supports so we're not going to

625
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:34,200
override it ourselves

626
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:38,010
but we will send the user a big warning
message

627
00:37:38,010 --> 00:37:44,150
saying this looks weird you should pay
special attention and review it

628
00:37:44,150 --> 00:37:47,820
arm so another issue

629
00:37:47,820 --> 00:37:52,230
is policy authorship so the other major
thing people bring up a lot is tyranny

630
00:37:52,230 --> 00:37:53,680
of the majority

631
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:57,029
of so first of I would say

632
00:37:57,030 --> 00:38:00,100
like my standard was before this problem

633
00:38:00,100 --> 00:38:03,299
exists in the current system and it is
very bad

634
00:38:03,300 --> 00:38:06,700
and the way that has historically been
worked out

635
00:38:06,700 --> 00:38:11,359
is not through the legislature I don't
think it can be intrinsically salter

636
00:38:11,359 --> 00:38:15,080
any kind legislature the reason is you
need to commit

637
00:38:15,080 --> 00:38:19,950
to principles and Rights that you put
outside of your control

638
00:38:19,950 --> 00:38:24,150
the way you do this is a constitution
with provision for writes that shall not

639
00:38:24,150 --> 00:38:25,490
be abridged

640
00:38:25,490 --> 00:38:29,140
are and a separate judiciary that
enforces that

641
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:32,910
so if you want to then pass a law that
says

642
00:38:32,910 --> 00:38:36,569
black people and white people are not
allowed to marry you can pass that law

643
00:38:36,570 --> 00:38:41,390
it'll be struck down unless you first
strike down the party the Constitution

644
00:38:41,390 --> 00:38:44,410
that preserves this right you could do
that

645
00:38:44,410 --> 00:38:48,149
but you're not going to and it's a lot
harder to I and it's a lot more

646
00:38:48,150 --> 00:38:49,660
transparent that you're being a

647
00:38:49,660 --> 00:38:52,660
ass I so it's it

648
00:38:52,660 --> 00:38:57,129
this is sort of a way to keep yourself
honest arm

649
00:38:57,130 --> 00:39:01,270
and you should also have I think higher
bars and currently exist for modifying

650
00:39:01,270 --> 00:39:02,650
state constitution so

651
00:39:02,650 --> 00:39:05,890
I don't know how many have you have look
to California's Constitution

652
00:39:05,890 --> 00:39:09,100
are you might want to sometime you any
point a my friend mine

653
00:39:09,100 --> 00:39:12,700
the Muni I pointed this out to me I one
point which is

654
00:39:12,700 --> 00:39:16,200
the this the covering Constitution is
crazy

655
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:20,710
I it's got all sorts random crop in
there that really should be just regular

656
00:39:20,710 --> 00:39:26,780
law arm constitutions really should be
like the US Constitution words about two

657
00:39:26,780 --> 00:39:27,609
things:

658
00:39:27,609 --> 00:39:32,080
metal aw and principles or rights

659
00:39:32,080 --> 00:39:36,589
that are that can be broadly applied or
are things that you want to commit to so

660
00:39:36,589 --> 00:39:37,259
you don't

661
00:39:37,260 --> 00:39:41,170
make a law about other stuff should be
regular law

662
00:39:41,170 --> 00:39:44,450
arm so that's a disclaimer I'm not

663
00:39:44,450 --> 00:39:48,000
a complete found on the California
process another is

664
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:51,220
are you're not gonna have a single like
internet wide

665
00:39:51,220 --> 00:39:54,280
law internet is not a jurisdiction

666
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:57,089
are laws exist within a given
jurisdiction and they should be

667
00:39:57,089 --> 00:39:58,089
supported

668
00:39:58,089 --> 00:40:02,720
by the people in that jurisdiction those
are the people you need to vote for it

669
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:06,380
and laws are going to be different state
to say your you don't like this but it's

670
00:40:06,380 --> 00:40:10,150
a fact some states are more liberal than
others some cities are more liberal than

671
00:40:10,150 --> 00:40:11,250
others

672
00:40:11,250 --> 00:40:16,100
%ah one place might wanna say are every
citizen is required

673
00:40:16,100 --> 00:40:19,580
to own a gun and have training others
are like

674
00:40:19,580 --> 00:40:22,740
guns you wanna guns and

675
00:40:22,740 --> 00:40:26,550
this varies just by Basil what people
want

676
00:40:26,550 --> 00:40:29,980
the discussion coming global but these
decisions are local

677
00:40:29,980 --> 00:40:33,770
arm their issues a public for we need
moderation

678
00:40:33,770 --> 00:40:39,359
we need to are have it be so that trolls
don't get very far

679
00:40:39,359 --> 00:40:43,770
in part we can do this by proxy power so
more proxy power you have the more

680
00:40:43,770 --> 00:40:46,210
people you represent presumably they

681
00:40:46,210 --> 00:40:49,800
believe what you say if they didn't you
wouldn't be

682
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:53,060
empowered to speak on their behalf so
this is one way to have

683
00:40:53,060 --> 00:40:57,320
serve and easy way to call the fire hose

684
00:40:57,320 --> 00:41:01,300
I and you can also have things like cars
stack overflow has great graduated

685
00:41:01,300 --> 00:41:02,470
privileges

686
00:41:02,470 --> 00:41:07,330
are so if you behave nicely we reward
you with more privileges ons

687
00:41:07,330 --> 00:41:11,940
arm we need to do neutral fact checking
out this is not as easy as it might seem

688
00:41:11,940 --> 00:41:13,359
for one

689
00:41:13,359 --> 00:41:16,850
determine what facts are is not entirely
always clear

690
00:41:16,850 --> 00:41:20,339
making sure it is neutral that people
trusted even when it's about

691
00:41:20,339 --> 00:41:22,089
controversial issues like say

692
00:41:22,089 --> 00:41:25,460
evolution are is also very difficult
because

693
00:41:25,460 --> 00:41:30,180
you need to be trusted for people to
give a shit about what you'd say the fax

694
00:41:30,180 --> 00:41:33,319
arm and the authoring process

695
00:41:33,320 --> 00:41:37,869
insert a gradual thing you can just jump
right into

696
00:41:37,869 --> 00:41:41,500
like drafting a foal Eagle bill

697
00:41:41,500 --> 00:41:45,900
arm then people get so attached that
particular thing it gets hard to talk

698
00:41:45,900 --> 00:41:48,270
about the actual details involved

699
00:41:48,270 --> 00:41:51,759
there's serve a gradual policy authoring
process

700
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:55,140
don't have time to get into it right now
but I'd be happy to talk about it

701
00:41:55,140 --> 00:41:56,900
afterwards

702
00:41:56,900 --> 00:42:00,410
arm so there have been similar systems
done

703
00:42:00,410 --> 00:42:04,560
ourself I mentioned a couple people in
the US were trying

704
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:09,420
Americans Elect did try art house or to
publicly nominated

705
00:42:09,420 --> 00:42:13,109
R presidential candidate arm

706
00:42:13,109 --> 00:42:16,210
and they failed are the reason they
failed as they

707
00:42:16,210 --> 00:42:19,540
required by an up front are

708
00:42:19,540 --> 00:42:22,770
and they required a large amount by and
that

709
00:42:22,770 --> 00:42:26,300
just doesn't work like I said you need
to you need to build gradually

710
00:42:26,300 --> 00:42:30,210
are I think it was like twenty thousand

711
00:42:30,210 --> 00:42:33,310
votes people needed to support a given
candidate

712
00:42:33,310 --> 00:42:36,480
distributed well across all the states

713
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:39,970
I i'm I'm not remembering the the
details exactly but it's on that order a

714
00:42:39,970 --> 00:42:41,280
magnet

715
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:45,560
arm and they just in they didn't meet
arm

716
00:42:45,560 --> 00:42:49,569
so some legal context I

717
00:42:49,569 --> 00:42:53,020
there are some questions about
electronic signatures so as I mentioned

718
00:42:53,020 --> 00:42:55,210
in california there's a recent case

719
00:42:55,210 --> 00:42:59,210
me versus slocum art years ago I founded
a company called

720
00:42:59,210 --> 00:43:03,290
there are firma which makes our
signatures offer for the iPhone

721
00:43:03,290 --> 00:43:06,980
where you can sign on your iPhone and
that would be committed to

722
00:43:06,980 --> 00:43:10,980
electronic version of the document
basically the appeals court supreme

723
00:43:10,980 --> 00:43:14,980
court hasn't mentioned anything about it
but the appeals court said no asobi

724
00:43:14,980 --> 00:43:18,089
Inc on paper too bad I even though

725
00:43:18,089 --> 00:43:22,040
%uh its well-established everything else
except for the Electoral Code

726
00:43:22,040 --> 00:43:26,319
electronic signatures are fine %uh by
contrast in Utah

727
00:43:26,319 --> 00:43:30,450
are digital signatures for ballot
initiatives have been approved

728
00:43:30,450 --> 00:43:33,940
of and its matter how exactly are they
gonna be regular

729
00:43:33,940 --> 00:43:37,440
arm something you might be curious about

730
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:41,530
for super PACs is there's a distinction

731
00:43:41,530 --> 00:43:45,650
between arm direct contributions so you
give money

732
00:43:45,650 --> 00:43:50,240
directly to some political committee are
independent

733
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:53,819
are advertisements are a spending about

734
00:43:53,819 --> 00:43:58,420
that politician and I non contribution
spending

735
00:43:58,420 --> 00:44:02,430
are non are non federal spending her
issue only spending these are separate

736
00:44:02,430 --> 00:44:03,569
things

737
00:44:03,569 --> 00:44:07,029
and there's this big disclosure loophole
like I said arm

738
00:44:07,030 --> 00:44:10,940
so what are we doing about that %uh well

739
00:44:10,940 --> 00:44:14,940
I were a pack are at least we will be
shortly we just

740
00:44:14,940 --> 00:44:18,339
filed for incorporation up the path we
filed for a corporation the others a

741
00:44:18,339 --> 00:44:21,839
couple months ago the pack only got part
for incorporation few weeks ago

742
00:44:21,839 --> 00:44:26,440
very shortly we're gonna be filing as
officially registered federal

743
00:44:26,440 --> 00:44:30,660
hybrid super PAC with the FEC that what
that means is we have standing

744
00:44:30,660 --> 00:44:33,910
asked the FEC for binding advisory
opinions

745
00:44:33,910 --> 00:44:37,890
are one of those opinions is how are we
to report our donors

746
00:44:37,890 --> 00:44:41,049
we want to do reporter donors like all
these other people

747
00:44:41,050 --> 00:44:44,859
tell us how arm there are other things
like

748
00:44:44,859 --> 00:44:48,020
how should we accept anonymous
contributions

749
00:44:48,020 --> 00:44:51,080
%uh goods like %uh surgeon cryptographic

750
00:44:51,080 --> 00:44:54,950
currencies you might be thinking arm

751
00:44:54,950 --> 00:44:58,880
another is what are the limits on
foreign national donations

752
00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:03,460
there are certain negative limits in
place right now but it's not very clear

753
00:45:03,460 --> 00:45:06,830
there's a bunch of things if you're
interested I can tell you a lot about

754
00:45:06,830 --> 00:45:10,270
FEC policy I but

755
00:45:10,270 --> 00:45:14,460
yeah ask me afterwards arm so where
we're at now

756
00:45:14,460 --> 00:45:18,880
arm like I said raskin the FEC for
opinion simultaneously were making a

757
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:20,040
donation site

758
00:45:20,040 --> 00:45:24,290
the idea is basically you'll be able to
give money to any political entity

759
00:45:24,290 --> 00:45:27,960
that is legal for you to give money to
arm

760
00:45:27,960 --> 00:45:31,210
and make sort of Kickstarter for
initiatives

761
00:45:31,210 --> 00:45:34,560
as it were are and away for

762
00:45:34,560 --> 00:45:37,569
to democratize the financing

763
00:45:37,569 --> 00:45:41,050
up these our politicians and the
initiatives later on

764
00:45:41,050 --> 00:45:45,680
will do petition signing entirely online
this is going to require test cases in

765
00:45:45,680 --> 00:45:47,540
the courts unfortunately

766
00:45:47,540 --> 00:45:52,050
are integration with political issues
you can track what politicians are doing

767
00:45:52,050 --> 00:45:56,890
better or worse for you issues and get
the money contingent on their behavior

768
00:45:56,890 --> 00:46:00,359
arm possibly running our own ads
dictated by

769
00:46:00,359 --> 00:46:03,650
you paid for by you run by us so that

770
00:46:03,650 --> 00:46:07,020
we take care of all the fine accounting
things in

771
00:46:07,020 --> 00:46:10,800
regulatory issues so you don't have to
give a shit arm

772
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:14,609
and possibly acting as an umbrella for
for new packs assertive

773
00:46:14,609 --> 00:46:17,980
grow up arm so we need

774
00:46:17,980 --> 00:46:21,319
a lot of help arm I do a lot of things
myself

775
00:46:21,319 --> 00:46:24,490
are but I can't do everything so

776
00:46:24,490 --> 00:46:29,069
pretty much no matter what you do if
you're a coder designer lawyer artist

777
00:46:29,069 --> 00:46:32,750
are on activist crypt auger for

778
00:46:32,750 --> 00:46:35,950
are an academic researcher sir for
social

779
00:46:35,950 --> 00:46:39,620
issues especially moderators community
managers

780
00:46:39,620 --> 00:46:43,319
our people are good for government
liaisons media

781
00:46:43,319 --> 00:46:46,940
grants arm anything like that please
talk to me

782
00:46:46,940 --> 00:46:50,480
I'm sure I can find something that you
would enjoy working on

783
00:46:50,480 --> 00:46:54,770
I if you wanna see our code is on github
dot com slash make your laws

784
00:46:54,770 --> 00:46:58,600
I we've already started contributing to
other projects like that New York Times

785
00:46:58,600 --> 00:47:03,230
jam called batch which I tracks FEC
filings

786
00:47:03,230 --> 00:47:06,510
arm so I guess my my final point is
simply

787
00:47:06,510 --> 00:47:10,819
so people chant on the streets this is
what democracy looks like

788
00:47:10,819 --> 00:47:15,220
well I would say this is what democracy
looks we want to empower you

789
00:47:15,220 --> 00:47:19,960
to make your laws for real and not just
begs some politician

790
00:47:19,960 --> 00:47:26,960
to please let you do it just do it

791
00:48:22,200 --> 00:48:22,700
yes

792
00:48:22,700 --> 00:48:27,050
so I'm that actually one other one of
the several projects I didn't mention is

793
00:48:27,050 --> 00:48:28,260
get for laws

794
00:48:28,260 --> 00:48:32,109
are that by itself I you might not the

795
00:48:32,109 --> 00:48:35,430
realize it but if you think through
that's a major project

796
00:48:35,430 --> 00:48:39,848
just unto itself so you're talking about
a simple markup language

797
00:48:39,849 --> 00:48:43,430
for laws the committee usually read and
that will

798
00:48:43,430 --> 00:48:47,460
hoc although in necessary things so that
it can be processed

799
00:48:47,460 --> 00:48:51,900
are if you you might not know the right
now there is no US Code in one place

800
00:48:51,900 --> 00:48:55,230
are because bills are in also it's a
crazy places

801
00:48:55,230 --> 00:48:59,200
they need to be integrated in piled
manually -ism major pain in the ass

802
00:48:59,200 --> 00:49:03,810
arm so this needs to be made in its
important things that need to be able to

803
00:49:03,810 --> 00:49:04,140
show

804
00:49:04,140 --> 00:49:07,578
diffs easily cuz bills are basically
commits

805
00:49:07,579 --> 00:49:10,660
a bill is a commit to the law arm

806
00:49:10,660 --> 00:49:14,680
and its integrates I idea how to
represent it but it needs to be made

807
00:49:14,680 --> 00:49:17,810
are and it's hard commenting system I

808
00:49:17,810 --> 00:49:20,960
right now word we're talking with the
guy named Travis crooklyn

809
00:49:20,960 --> 00:49:24,540
of communism called reflect slash
consider it

810
00:49:24,540 --> 00:49:28,270
are consider capital I T arm

811
00:49:28,270 --> 00:49:31,550
which is sorta a way for people to
discuss some things and

812
00:49:31,550 --> 00:49:35,089
and so that they understand what other
people in the conversation said and

813
00:49:35,089 --> 00:49:37,400
summarize insert propagates up nicely

814
00:49:37,400 --> 00:49:41,250
of in needs work are but I think it's a
really good start

815
00:49:41,250 --> 00:49:44,550
I and there are other aspects of the
discussions are some that we really

816
00:49:44,550 --> 00:49:44,930
wanna

817
00:49:44,930 --> 00:49:48,618
nails its it's part of why we're not
ruling out immediately cuz

818
00:49:48,619 --> 00:49:52,640
that part we want to get right it can't
be like you generic

819
00:49:52,640 --> 00:49:57,529
I A news forum %ah its gonna have to
rise a little bit higher

820
00:49:57,530 --> 00:50:04,220
yup arm

821
00:50:04,220 --> 00:50:08,710
their different their bribe in that for
one they're not going to the politician

822
00:50:08,710 --> 00:50:12,890
are for two I it's really no different
then

823
00:50:12,890 --> 00:50:16,440
core highly protected political speech
namely

824
00:50:16,440 --> 00:50:20,089
you are very very strongly protected

825
00:50:20,089 --> 00:50:23,380
if you say I support slash

826
00:50:23,380 --> 00:50:27,109
oppose senator bob because he voted

827
00:50:27,109 --> 00:50:31,720
on this issue now you are highly
protected if you say

828
00:50:31,720 --> 00:50:36,530
therefore I am going to donate 20 boxes
reelection campaign in

829
00:50:36,530 --> 00:50:40,160
all y'all should do the same thing the
only thing we're doing

830
00:50:40,160 --> 00:50:43,210
is making that transparent and making it

831
00:50:43,210 --> 00:50:46,900
more agregar ball so it's more visible

832
00:50:46,900 --> 00:50:53,900
are than it is now well kinda pissing
match

833
00:51:02,640 --> 00:51:05,129
of well for one we wouldn't necessarily

834
00:51:05,130 --> 00:51:09,730
permit everybody to donate unlimited
amounts so we would have our own ethical

835
00:51:09,730 --> 00:51:10,510
policies

836
00:51:10,510 --> 00:51:15,240
arm but if you're pissing match is like
how much can I raise

837
00:51:15,240 --> 00:51:18,970
we would show like what is what is your

838
00:51:18,970 --> 00:51:22,600
your jaw amount base right

839
00:51:22,600 --> 00:51:26,020
so if if one person shows I raise a
million bucks

840
00:51:26,020 --> 00:51:30,340
from to people and the other person
shows I raised a million bucks

841
00:51:30,340 --> 00:51:35,780
from 5,000 people how is that going to
play out politically

842
00:51:35,780 --> 00:51:42,780
okay so the question is what are the
constitutional affects

843
00:51:51,130 --> 00:51:56,110
I love people voting for you in a proxy
system of the short answer is

844
00:51:56,110 --> 00:51:59,140
arm within an organization

845
00:51:59,140 --> 00:52:03,350
its obviously completely legal lotsa
corporations already use proxy

846
00:52:03,350 --> 00:52:07,259
yet so for for the meantime

847
00:52:07,260 --> 00:52:11,460
were the liquor democracy would be
entirely within maker laws itself

848
00:52:11,460 --> 00:52:15,510
and the way it would have power is
through our foothold on the outside

849
00:52:15,510 --> 00:52:18,640
once we have enough power outside now we
can sort

850
00:52:18,640 --> 00:52:22,700
which dropped into the official says per
sec there are laws against

851
00:52:22,700 --> 00:52:27,560
something like donating in the name of
another person not very definitely

852
00:52:27,560 --> 00:52:28,740
illegal and we will

853
00:52:28,740 --> 00:52:35,740
Aug you yes I have

854
00:52:38,960 --> 00:52:40,819
arm I

855
00:52:40,819 --> 00:52:44,359
have I heard the sea said he moving
movement see standing

856
00:52:44,359 --> 00:52:47,499
movement and would it be compatible with
them arm

857
00:52:47,499 --> 00:52:51,329
I don't want to comment on the see
steady movement per se

858
00:52:51,329 --> 00:52:55,769
%uh be a simply because I I have nothing
to do with an I don't feel comfortable

859
00:52:55,769 --> 00:52:56,829
speaking for them

860
00:52:56,829 --> 00:53:00,950
I do think that arm while they would not
affect

861
00:53:00,950 --> 00:53:04,229
our laws their ideas are up to get
outsider a loss right

862
00:53:04,229 --> 00:53:08,880
arm it what I think it would be
compatible with for any organization or

863
00:53:08,880 --> 00:53:10,769
any group that wants to run itself

864
00:53:10,769 --> 00:53:17,769
in a in a good way and I think that
includes

865
00:53:28,589 --> 00:53:31,720
so actually less occurs is one of the
people we've been talking to as well

866
00:53:31,720 --> 00:53:35,470
arm so what blessings major ideas as
people's

867
00:53:35,470 --> 00:53:38,140
is democratizing the

868
00:53:38,140 --> 00:53:39,170
the

869
00:53:39,170 --> 00:53:42,740
the country contribution to his right
having a wider contribution base

870
00:53:42,740 --> 00:53:47,080
it's not incompatible with the specific
things that he presents a specifically

871
00:53:47,080 --> 00:53:48,509
he proposes for example

872
00:53:48,510 --> 00:53:53,490
everyone gets a fifty dollar voucher are
as a democracy downturn can spend

873
00:53:53,490 --> 00:53:55,990
however you want as long as it spent on
political purposes

874
00:53:55,990 --> 00:53:59,790
are so that you don't feel like you know
it's your money and you know owners are

875
00:53:59,790 --> 00:54:00,340
not good on

876
00:54:00,340 --> 00:54:03,370
and furthermore the if you do donate
your money

877
00:54:03,370 --> 00:54:06,940
there we a state-backed doubling or
tripling of it

878
00:54:06,940 --> 00:54:10,630
I and that there would be strip more
stringent limits above the max

879
00:54:10,630 --> 00:54:14,730
how much someone can don't I think these
are all completely compatible

880
00:54:14,730 --> 00:54:18,380
and if anything would benefit from and
two

881
00:54:18,380 --> 00:54:21,550
what we're trying to do they're not
however mandatory

882
00:54:21,550 --> 00:54:25,490
and are I think a critical flaw with
less explain is

883
00:54:25,490 --> 00:54:29,400
he wants to first have this past and
then fix this

884
00:54:29,400 --> 00:54:33,300
and I don't think you can do that I it

885
00:54:33,300 --> 00:54:36,410
you need to gradually have the power
yeah

886
00:54:36,410 --> 00:54:39,700
but we can bootstrap to that with

887
00:54:39,700 --> 00:54:43,260
if we gradually gain power and then past
that

888
00:54:43,260 --> 00:54:50,260
awesome we have more power

889
00:54:54,650 --> 00:55:01,650
yeah

890
00:55:03,089 --> 00:55:04,470
church %uh so how

891
00:55:04,470 --> 00:55:08,789
how you granular Isaac so there's two
answers are wonders

892
00:55:08,789 --> 00:55:12,490
I bills per se you don't have any say

893
00:55:12,490 --> 00:55:16,180
in what gets proposed in congress simple
fact

894
00:55:16,180 --> 00:55:19,260
are you can say if you do this

895
00:55:19,260 --> 00:55:24,289
I will do that I am that's basically all
you can do are so

896
00:55:24,289 --> 00:55:29,579
for stuff in actual are congress' your
granularity is whatever they give you

897
00:55:29,579 --> 00:55:32,670
arm for our own internal policy making

898
00:55:32,670 --> 00:55:35,940
so the process that would lead up to

899
00:55:35,940 --> 00:55:39,099
us putting something on the ballot
ourselves

900
00:55:39,099 --> 00:55:43,140
are I rode I don't have time to go into
the full details please

901
00:55:43,140 --> 00:55:48,220
talk to me afterwards the basic idea is
you use a lazy branching discussion

902
00:55:48,220 --> 00:55:48,829
system

903
00:55:48,829 --> 00:55:52,910
where you have you basically say what
you want the state will ought to be

904
00:55:52,910 --> 00:55:56,819
not like how you want to change a law
because thats jurisdiction dependent on

905
00:55:56,819 --> 00:55:58,720
you can have a global conversation about
that

906
00:55:58,720 --> 00:56:02,660
but what do you want the lot actually be
and then when you have

907
00:56:02,660 --> 00:56:05,750
real disagreements the new branch

908
00:56:05,750 --> 00:56:10,230
you say okay so for this this part of it
okay here the possible options here

909
00:56:10,230 --> 00:56:14,049
you know why you might choose one of
them and then within that there's more

910
00:56:14,049 --> 00:56:15,140
and more and more detail

911
00:56:15,140 --> 00:56:18,480
arm so I think for example one thing
that people

912
00:56:18,480 --> 00:56:21,869
often see is irresolvable differences so
abortion for example

913
00:56:21,869 --> 00:56:25,440
people often see you know people who
support

914
00:56:25,440 --> 00:56:29,619
the right to abortion under any
circumstances and people who say like

915
00:56:29,619 --> 00:56:33,720
the right to abortion only on if it
threatens the life of the mother

916
00:56:33,720 --> 00:56:37,069
these are irresolvable positions and
that's just not true

917
00:56:37,069 --> 00:56:41,038
are they both support abortion in some
circumstances therefore they can

918
00:56:41,039 --> 00:56:42,420
collaborate on things like

919
00:56:42,420 --> 00:56:46,380
out what are the medical standards for
performing an abortion safely

920
00:56:46,380 --> 00:56:49,839
how can we make this easily available so
that people don't have to

921
00:56:49,839 --> 00:56:53,519
do in by why is it after how can it be
supported by insurance since you agree

922
00:56:53,519 --> 00:56:55,240
that some amounts at least

923
00:56:55,240 --> 00:56:58,660
I should be supported obviously all
disagree on what

924
00:56:58,660 --> 00:57:02,700
and that will be a a branch of the
policy and one side or the other will

925
00:57:02,700 --> 00:57:03,170
win

926
00:57:03,170 --> 00:57:06,750
in a given jours decks but we can at
least make it so that

927
00:57:06,750 --> 00:57:09,960
on as much as possible the line items

928
00:57:09,960 --> 00:57:14,289
you can collect when I can get everyone
to single by altogether

929
00:57:14,289 --> 00:57:18,400
but leeson's up i think thats all I have
time for

930
00:57:18,400 --> 00:57:22,509
however I I know marv you want to ask me
I'll

931
00:57:22,509 --> 00:57:25,299
bunch more questions and I'm happy to
discuss them right
