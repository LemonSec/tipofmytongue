1
00:00:01,260 --> 00:00:05,540
this to print

2
00:00:05,540 --> 00:00:10,620
maybe them Jim

3
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:14,579
trees I arm

4
00:00:14,579 --> 00:00:18,490
so thank you very much for coming today
on this is elected bodies

5
00:00:18,490 --> 00:00:22,509
and possible worlds using virtual
reality augmented reality

6
00:00:22,509 --> 00:00:26,000
in altered reality gaming to explore

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,410
self-expression empowerment and
community-building

8
00:00:29,410 --> 00:00:32,759
ends this is arm

9
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:37,239
and presentation that have slowly been
building materials for for a while now

10
00:00:37,239 --> 00:00:40,539
some really happy about having the
opportunity to present this to you folks

11
00:00:40,539 --> 00:00:44,199
love people know they represented are
last hope

12
00:00:44,199 --> 00:00:48,579
are talking specifically about
virtual-reality globe in summer does do

13
00:00:48,579 --> 00:00:52,629
the cervix bans on that so because they
want to do

14
00:00:52,629 --> 00:00:59,190
is arm the give you this quote this was
passed on to me by my friend horrible

15
00:00:59,190 --> 00:01:04,480
who used to see our son Ryan the Blues
and Jazz Festival in Ann Arbor

16
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:08,350
and the code is you think you're human
what if you need in jewel

17
00:01:08,350 --> 00:01:11,409
instead and will it take that to mean is

18
00:01:11,409 --> 00:01:14,720
we have blue boxes that we live in

19
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:17,820
we have are forms

20
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:21,759
that we adhere to in society that we
hear to personally

21
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:25,780
because fear because if not knowing how
to express ourselves

22
00:01:25,780 --> 00:01:29,729
and because I'm not really knowing
sometimes how to connect with people

23
00:01:29,729 --> 00:01:33,259
in our community and we have an
opportunity now

24
00:01:33,259 --> 00:01:36,890
with increased technology to explore

25
00:01:36,890 --> 00:01:41,280
the things in ourselves are the maybe we
haven't had an opportunity to do before

26
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:42,350
and we also have

27
00:01:42,350 --> 00:01:46,750
a chance to takes all those things we
haven't been able to put into words

28
00:01:46,750 --> 00:01:49,930
or image or sound arm

29
00:01:49,930 --> 00:01:53,560
things we've tried to communicate with
people before been happened with new

30
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:55,799
technologies we now have the ability to

31
00:01:55,799 --> 00:01:59,390
create environments creepy things were
really express ourselves

32
00:01:59,390 --> 00:02:03,140
to other people so reduce turnout

33
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:06,409
with are myself talking about

34
00:02:06,409 --> 00:02:10,790
overview virtual and augmented reality
and really what that means

35
00:02:10,789 --> 00:02:13,940
member to talk about DIY

36
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:17,780
technology so that you can create these
things yourself

37
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:21,280
I see many many discussions on line and

38
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:25,970
panels and movies know these things
about augmented virtual reality in their

39
00:02:25,970 --> 00:02:26,790
own very

40
00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:31,230
sir distant and they're all sort of for
either large companies

41
00:02:31,230 --> 00:02:35,299
or four people who were incredibly
technically knowledgeable on certain

42
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:35,940
things

43
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:39,210
people that are certified member geeks
in this is actually something that

44
00:02:39,210 --> 00:02:39,960
people who

45
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:45,070
even you people who haven't handed our
programming experience before anything

46
00:02:45,070 --> 00:02:46,060
like that can do

47
00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:49,070
income created for themselves then Micah

48
00:02:49,070 --> 00:02:52,750
I was gonna talk about arguments and
some for other related projects

49
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:56,620
and hidden you can talk about radical in
the Victoria G

50
00:02:56,620 --> 00:03:00,830
I'll the Pretoria education an alternate
reality games

51
00:03:00,830 --> 00:03:04,210
so essentially moving from the history

52
00:03:04,210 --> 00:03:08,330
VR in Augmented Reality to some of the
technical aspects other

53
00:03:08,330 --> 00:03:11,360
then moving into actual real-life
examples

54
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:17,290
%uh how we are able to express ourselves
in community with ourselves in changer

55
00:03:17,290 --> 00:03:18,150
cells

56
00:03:18,150 --> 00:03:21,580
through these things so let's start out
with my

57
00:03:21,580 --> 00:03:25,500
arm little overview hereof augmented and
virtual reality

58
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:28,600
little bit from with explanation

59
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:31,940
I run a company called sons research in
my spare time

60
00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:36,210
from my day job working education on my
company does work in augmented reality

61
00:03:36,210 --> 00:03:37,370
virtual reality

62
00:03:37,370 --> 00:03:41,270
and reading different types have
applications in creating systems

63
00:03:41,270 --> 00:03:44,830
are for people to be able to communicate
with each other and express

64
00:03:44,830 --> 00:03:48,470
things to each other so what is virtual
reality

65
00:03:48,470 --> 00:03:51,490
arm how many people have actually been

66
00:03:51,490 --> 00:03:56,530
used a virtual reality devices some kind
before some sort of system

67
00:03:56,530 --> 00:04:00,520
missus children's we get a fair amount
actually that's a that's a good number

68
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:01,120
right there

69
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:05,120
aren't so virtual reality is an
immersive 3d generated

70
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:08,120
environment hands arm

71
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:11,590
it could be generated in waterways it's
become computer-generated

72
00:04:11,590 --> 00:04:15,580
for the most part and the environment to
be created with animation

73
00:04:15,580 --> 00:04:19,799
and or photography and sound and had how
feedback

74
00:04:19,798 --> 00:04:24,510
different types of haptic feedback in in
a virtual environment

75
00:04:24,510 --> 00:04:28,240
there are avatars the representations
own

76
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:32,640
people here in the real world and those
avatars can navigate

77
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:36,530
through the environment %uh and can
grasp

78
00:04:36,530 --> 00:04:39,690
objects and do things are through

79
00:04:39,690 --> 00:04:44,040
are devices here in real-world that are
used

80
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:48,420
and basically is input to the virtual
environment

81
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:51,450
and these input devices can be Globes

82
00:04:51,450 --> 00:04:55,050
no joysticks are and recently

83
00:04:55,050 --> 00:04:58,150
are sensors have become very popular in
their very

84
00:04:58,150 --> 00:05:01,260
inexpensive in easily accessible

85
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:05,599
are two people will be talking about
that as well motion sensors

86
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:08,890
switches augmented reality wideman
release a little bit different in

87
00:05:08,890 --> 00:05:09,729
virtual reality

88
00:05:09,730 --> 00:05:14,670
in the sense that augmented reality is
you're taking things from the real world

89
00:05:14,670 --> 00:05:18,420
in your ball over earlier in medical
information

90
00:05:18,420 --> 00:05:21,660
on their are so in other words

91
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:25,280
your looking at something it's generally
visual right now but I'm you make the

92
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:27,360
argument that augmented reality

93
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:31,320
can be audio and sound as well as well
as just touch

94
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:34,490
we won a limited to just visual although
it has been

95
00:05:34,490 --> 00:05:38,320
arm in so you're overlay room your Larry

96
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:42,230
over the real-world information with med
information

97
00:05:42,230 --> 00:05:46,170
information about what it is that you're
experiencing

98
00:05:46,170 --> 00:05:50,080
and it's becoming very popular with
mobile devices there's a lot of Dr B's

99
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:53,430
amps on mobile devices were you can
pointing

100
00:05:53,430 --> 00:05:57,310
your full moon added and objectors seem

101
00:05:57,310 --> 00:06:02,080
and 100 recognized I'm and you'll see
information overlaid over that image

102
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:03,590
about what it is the year

103
00:06:03,590 --> 00:06:07,370
seem were here im thats augmented
reality

104
00:06:07,370 --> 00:06:11,440
know what are the uses this right so you
can simulate

105
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:16,310
the real world in a virtual environment
in other words you can create a mock-up

106
00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:19,740
are the real world in a virtual
environment arm

107
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:23,270
and in Augmented Reality you can
identify and provide information about

108
00:06:23,270 --> 00:06:24,539
something

109
00:06:24,540 --> 00:06:28,130
in the real world in the uses for this
arm

110
00:06:28,130 --> 00:06:31,490
are physical and psychological research

111
00:06:31,490 --> 00:06:34,660
I in rehabilitation so physical
rehabilitation

112
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:39,030
people moving are psychological
rehabilitation people getting over fears

113
00:06:39,030 --> 00:06:40,400
and different things

114
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:44,260
arm and also education and training
learning how to do tasks

115
00:06:44,260 --> 00:06:49,400
doctors learning how to do surgery are
by practicing in a virtual environment

116
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:54,080
we're doing actual surgery with
augmented reality reducing information

117
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,409
about what they're working on

118
00:06:55,410 --> 00:06:58,480
actually layered over the live image

119
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:01,510
up the patient and also for
communication

120
00:07:01,510 --> 00:07:04,599
virtual reality is used you can be given
in the in the

121
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:08,510
smallest sense I love things like that
avatar image

122
00:07:08,510 --> 00:07:11,630
the you have the former are

123
00:07:11,630 --> 00:07:15,700
different online games for social
networking you have your little image

124
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:17,260
that represents you

125
00:07:17,260 --> 00:07:21,900
arm now expand that to think I love on
an actual character

126
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:26,190
that's representing you in an
environment so we could be communication

127
00:07:26,190 --> 00:07:31,090
and when I'm gonna focus on here today's
and i think is the most important one

128
00:07:31,090 --> 00:07:35,040
is personal exploration and expression

129
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:40,510
and building community and finding new
ways of expressing what's inside you

130
00:07:40,510 --> 00:07:41,880
mention I feel very

131
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:45,460
a privilege in way to come after the
panel that was just on

132
00:07:45,460 --> 00:07:49,480
because I think that this is actually
something they can hope people

133
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:52,730
aren't too be who they want to be are

134
00:07:52,730 --> 00:07:55,770
to express themselves to others and to
to lose

135
00:07:55,770 --> 00:07:58,930
fear are in in being who they are

136
00:07:58,930 --> 00:08:02,810
and expressing themselves and explore if
you're comfortable unexplored

137
00:08:02,810 --> 00:08:05,750
know something about virtual worlds as
virtual worlds you can create something

138
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:07,699
that's never been created before

139
00:08:07,699 --> 00:08:11,190
it comes out your mind you can create
something out there that other people

140
00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:15,540
can see so the history of immersion what
is the history

141
00:08:15,540 --> 00:08:19,100
amer-asian 100 get here will the first

142
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:22,180
briefers things we know love Arkiv
paintings

143
00:08:22,180 --> 00:08:25,830
now these these cave paintings date back
41

144
00:08:25,830 --> 00:08:31,139
thousand years forty-one thousand years
is a long time ago

145
00:08:31,139 --> 00:08:34,909
but it was the first way for

146
00:08:34,909 --> 00:08:38,669
people to basically remove themselves
out of time and space

147
00:08:38,669 --> 00:08:42,750
in go someplace else were feel that they
are going someplace else

148
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:46,190
so there were two dimensional
representations but they're taking you

149
00:08:46,190 --> 00:08:48,320
out if your current time and space

150
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:52,250
in the earliest cave paintings are in
Spain is referred to as a paper that was

151
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:54,760
just released about four weeks ago about
these

152
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:58,230
keep innings in Spain two interesting
things came on at this

153
00:08:58,230 --> 00:09:02,670
this paper from this research team the
first thing is that

154
00:09:02,670 --> 00:09:06,089
the arm the cave paintings

155
00:09:06,089 --> 00:09:09,260
are abstract they're not just like

156
00:09:09,260 --> 00:09:12,800
a scene if some grass and some animals
running around ur

157
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:17,589
anything like that their abstract
they're representations have ideas

158
00:09:17,589 --> 00:09:21,800
not necessarily scenes on the other
interesting thing is that these may have

159
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:24,089
actually been created by me and riffles

160
00:09:24,089 --> 00:09:28,380
pre humans that's fascinating as well

161
00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:32,060
know if you fast forward a little bit
are there he is

162
00:09:32,060 --> 00:09:36,000
the Florentine painter GI DDO who
created the first paintings to have

163
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,270
perspective the first paintings that
were just two-dimensional the actually

164
00:09:40,270 --> 00:09:45,370
sure who did that something is coming
out at you that it's in three dimensions

165
00:09:45,370 --> 00:09:48,589
and arm you can actually find out more
about this

166
00:09:48,589 --> 00:09:53,130
trend have 2d to 3d in how it meshed
with science

167
00:09:53,130 --> 00:09:56,790
others a book by guy named Leonard
Schley man called Burton physics

168
00:09:56,790 --> 00:10:00,849
that actually follows through history
how this happened how science

169
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:04,230
%uh in our knowledge the world around us
and art

170
00:10:04,230 --> 00:10:07,270
continued to go are upward in

171
00:10:07,270 --> 00:10:12,399
and we continue to learn more in 1788
the Scottish artist Robert Barker

172
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:16,350
painted a 360-degree depiction the city
remember

173
00:10:16,350 --> 00:10:19,910
in he actually it was actually displayed
in a circular room

174
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:24,640
so that you could turn in in experience
this this was the first

175
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:28,600
with the copy and ramen painting

176
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:33,080
and in 1838 the British scientist Sir
Charles Wheatstone

177
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:36,870
ok invented the stereoscope now little
bit about this

178
00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:40,960
when you look at something you've got
two eyes they're slightly separated

179
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:44,730
see you're seeing things from slightly
different angles from each I

180
00:10:44,730 --> 00:10:49,180
that is one of the components that
creates depth perception that creates

181
00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:52,620
three dimensions know something only
thing scientists have found out that

182
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:54,760
actually if someone loses 1 I'm

183
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:59,180
they can still see a little bit up three
dimensions so there's something else

184
00:10:59,180 --> 00:11:01,529
going on in the brains map going on

185
00:11:01,529 --> 00:11:05,060
but primarily it's with 2 I's so Charles
Wheatstone figure this out

186
00:11:05,060 --> 00:11:08,260
any use to mir's basically stood

187
00:11:08,260 --> 00:11:11,490
into images and in mir's that you could
look at this

188
00:11:11,490 --> 00:11:16,460
and see in three dimensions and in 1948
a scottish scientist David Brewster

189
00:11:16,460 --> 00:11:17,830
improved on this

190
00:11:17,830 --> 00:11:21,080
by utilizing presumes you submit a much
smaller

191
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:24,560
see you could actually carry this in
your hands

192
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:27,850
nachos brewster also invented the
Kaleidoscope you folks have probably

193
00:11:27,850 --> 00:11:28,740
seen

194
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:32,160
the two were you turn it in rotating
colors and stuff

195
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:36,709
who came up with that in 1817 just
anecdote that i think is really cool

196
00:11:36,710 --> 00:11:41,760
so these are called stereoscope devices
that have two images

197
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:46,160
in you can actually look through little
glasses

198
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:50,430
and CDs now I just so happen to have

199
00:11:50,430 --> 00:11:55,250
the stereoscope this is an antique and
as you can see there's a card here with

200
00:11:55,250 --> 00:11:56,820
two images

201
00:11:56,820 --> 00:12:00,839
and it's placed in the sort of thing
here

202
00:12:00,839 --> 00:12:05,500
and then you go like this you get to
write were you wanna

203
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:11,240
move this slide forward and it looks
like the images in three dimensions

204
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:16,410
just like this and I the

205
00:12:16,410 --> 00:12:19,540
brought this on the plane on my lap %uh

206
00:12:19,540 --> 00:12:23,370
because I wanted to bring it to you and
i actually I'm gonna pass the surround

207
00:12:23,370 --> 00:12:24,730
keep in mind this is me and he gets

208
00:12:24,730 --> 00:12:28,070
almost a hundred years old buttress that
you guys can take your

209
00:12:28,070 --> 00:12:31,130
them don't pull this all the way of

210
00:12:31,130 --> 00:12:35,520
which is pulled slightly forward into it
focuses and you actually see the image

211
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:42,209
in 3d so start hearing him

212
00:12:42,209 --> 00:12:46,520
the first devices three-dimensional view

213
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:51,069
and a in each room 98 United States
inventor Thomas Edison

214
00:12:51,070 --> 00:12:54,089
invented the Canada scope and I'm sure

215
00:12:54,089 --> 00:12:57,670
with him in school because it was the
precursor to

216
00:12:57,670 --> 00:13:02,690
I'll basically film as we know what the
other inventors doing similar things

217
00:13:02,690 --> 00:13:06,390
at the same time but I'm citizen gets
the credit

218
00:13:06,390 --> 00:13:10,199
and in film and television of course
this expanded in the late nineteen

219
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:11,180
nineties

220
00:13:11,180 --> 00:13:15,620
the filmmaker William freeze agreement a
patented the first 3d movie technique

221
00:13:15,620 --> 00:13:19,420
using actually a stereoscope type
display

222
00:13:19,420 --> 00:13:22,600
in flickering images in 1915

223
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:27,200
wilma supporter is and will be 10
demonstrated 3d movie techniques using

224
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:28,630
an eclipse

225
00:13:28,630 --> 00:13:32,410
know any good pics of course are

226
00:13:32,410 --> 00:13:35,500
girls right with the two colours

227
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:40,000
the ideas you do one image in one color
another image in the other color

228
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:44,470
and then when you look it looks like
it's three dimensions

229
00:13:44,470 --> 00:13:47,370
im serve throughout the nineteen fifties
and sixties there was a lot of

230
00:13:47,370 --> 00:13:50,050
experimentation in film with three
dimensions

231
00:13:50,050 --> 00:13:53,089
aren't using the analytic technique can
also

232
00:13:53,089 --> 00:13:56,450
using something called CinemaScope which
was

233
00:13:56,450 --> 00:14:02,290
a camera system that took a very wide
shot very wide field of view

234
00:14:02,290 --> 00:14:07,160
and when it was projected it felt like
it was a merciful around him

235
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:11,640
missus 3d decline are starting in the
nineteen seventies

236
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:15,250
in on the recent years few spare who is
Friday the 13th in 3d

237
00:14:15,250 --> 00:14:19,260
brown and really low blow recently it
came back in popularity because

238
00:14:19,260 --> 00:14:22,870
avatar and now we're seeing lots of
movies the past couple years that are

239
00:14:22,870 --> 00:14:25,050
you lies in 3d

240
00:14:25,050 --> 00:14:28,529
end zone let's go back to the history
little bit so

241
00:14:28,529 --> 00:14:32,880
government in military research in
actually this is good time to

242
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:36,040
a panel that's going to happen tomorrow
that I hope folks check out

243
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:39,140
about are military funding

244
00:14:39,140 --> 00:14:42,380
I love technology in creating technology

245
00:14:42,380 --> 00:14:46,050
and %uh this brings up some interesting
questions

246
00:14:46,050 --> 00:14:50,730
sort of the fill the need for better
cockpit simulations radar systems and

247
00:14:50,730 --> 00:14:51,649
information

248
00:14:51,649 --> 00:14:55,640
sharing systems the government and the
military started looking into

249
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:59,350
virtual-reality and immersive
environments

250
00:14:59,350 --> 00:15:02,680
began in the nineteen forties was
inspired by the ratings above

251
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:06,120
then if your bush are rooted in article
in the Atlantic

252
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:10,140
about a hypothetical device called the
Mex which basically we're

253
00:15:10,140 --> 00:15:13,620
is the precursor to the modern computer

254
00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:17,120
and the research rigid with people like
double single bird

255
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:20,950
Larry Robertson Ivan Sutherland want
people who you know as the founding

256
00:15:20,950 --> 00:15:22,130
fathers have computing

257
00:15:22,130 --> 00:15:25,649
doubles and murder of course the our
Creator the mouse

258
00:15:25,649 --> 00:15:30,380
and inventor video conferencing and
texted him in all these guys were funded

259
00:15:30,380 --> 00:15:32,060
and encouraged by a guy named

260
00:15:32,060 --> 00:15:36,519
JCR little lighter and if you've never
heard of look lighter you should go to

261
00:15:36,519 --> 00:15:38,160
investigate this guy

262
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:41,779
he was at Harper in he took a lot of
money from the government and the

263
00:15:41,779 --> 00:15:42,740
military in

264
00:15:42,740 --> 00:15:46,950
put it towards these advanced research
projects to create a lot of the things

265
00:15:46,950 --> 00:15:50,450
that we have now in terms of technology

266
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:53,649
and one things that came out and this
was the

267
00:15:53,649 --> 00:15:57,000
in 1966 at MIT's Lincoln Laboratory

268
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,410
was the first head-mounted display by
Ivan Sutherland was called

269
00:16:00,410 --> 00:16:03,410
thus word of Damocles and use a.m.

270
00:16:03,410 --> 00:16:07,019
you when you look at the picture you can
see why he could take off your head

271
00:16:07,019 --> 00:16:07,899
really

272
00:16:07,899 --> 00:16:12,610
I was you you my small cathode ray tubes
on the side Mon 18 years

273
00:16:12,610 --> 00:16:18,420
in some years to basically see what was
going on around you

274
00:16:18,420 --> 00:16:22,420
and thanks who died out in terms of
immersive environments for

275
00:16:22,420 --> 00:16:27,160
about ten years until nasa a decided to
get involved in the

276
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:31,949
arm immersion settlement for 10 mins ago
involve looking for a way to train

277
00:16:31,950 --> 00:16:32,990
pilots

278
00:16:32,990 --> 00:16:37,430
in for navigating robots to be able to
collect samples and you various things

279
00:16:37,430 --> 00:16:41,839
and nasa's funding in various projects
ignited a virtual reality craze

280
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:46,510
in the eighties and early nineties that
affected both government in the private

281
00:16:46,510 --> 00:16:47,360
sector

282
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:51,209
on several important projects were
created leap in view are the two most

283
00:16:51,209 --> 00:16:52,550
important ones

284
00:16:52,550 --> 00:16:55,930
that had to do with viewing and grasping
things

285
00:16:55,930 --> 00:16:59,269
are and nasa research which was
published because it was

286
00:16:59,269 --> 00:17:04,029
government-funded argued with the data
had to be made public in research had to

287
00:17:04,029 --> 00:17:04,799
be made public

288
00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:08,489
that actually inspired ppl research in a
lot of other companies

289
00:17:08,489 --> 00:17:12,619
are to be created no VPL research was
started by going injured when you're

290
00:17:12,618 --> 00:17:13,089
whose

291
00:17:13,089 --> 00:17:17,259
were my heroes I love technology and
some

292
00:17:17,259 --> 00:17:20,929
his work and the work going Thomas
Zimmerman created the first

293
00:17:20,929 --> 00:17:25,359
glove the first data glove in 1985

294
00:17:25,358 --> 00:17:29,949
and to provide the ability to navigate
in X yinz

295
00:17:29,950 --> 00:17:33,460
so are you can think of it as a X

296
00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:37,669
and wine lindsey is depth rainer like
this

297
00:17:37,669 --> 00:17:41,259
and apply the ability to grasp objects
in the environment utilized

298
00:17:41,259 --> 00:17:45,149
flex information from Ben sensors and
sometimes light sensors depending on the

299
00:17:45,149 --> 00:17:47,679
different versions that they had

300
00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:52,450
and we'll talk a little bit about the
history of the encompassing environments

301
00:17:52,450 --> 00:17:56,190
right things that are im the whole
environment around you not just the

302
00:17:56,190 --> 00:17:57,489
technology

303
00:17:57,489 --> 00:18:00,820
so 1960 the United States inventor
morton highlighted

304
00:18:00,820 --> 00:18:05,090
created something called the sensor RAM
a the sensor ima was a box

305
00:18:05,090 --> 00:18:08,129
that you would sit in it was like an
hour to feed them and

306
00:18:08,129 --> 00:18:12,460
it was touch vibration and smell

307
00:18:12,460 --> 00:18:15,529
and powers film in sound

308
00:18:15,529 --> 00:18:19,629
on things like a motorcycle ride and
whatnot and actually have some pictures

309
00:18:19,629 --> 00:18:20,399
here

310
00:18:20,399 --> 00:18:24,330
up from some advertise who perceive
always got the attractive young woman

311
00:18:24,330 --> 00:18:27,730
%uh to help with your advertising and
this was

312
00:18:27,730 --> 00:18:30,980
really interesting system it didn't take
our it made a few

313
00:18:30,980 --> 00:18:34,820
appearances a carnivals and whatnot and
some love conferences

314
00:18:34,820 --> 00:18:39,158
really didn't get a lot of attention are
men in the late nineteen seventies a

315
00:18:39,159 --> 00:18:41,029
group with MIT folks

316
00:18:41,029 --> 00:18:45,129
are created the aspin movie map and this
is really important and affects us a lot

317
00:18:45,129 --> 00:18:46,179
today

318
00:18:46,179 --> 00:18:51,109
this was a system video disks with
images and video from Aspen Colorado

319
00:18:51,109 --> 00:18:55,658
in you could select on a map a
particular place

320
00:18:55,659 --> 00:18:58,909
and it would actually bring up the video
in the images

321
00:18:58,909 --> 00:19:02,789
and play them back for you so was like
you were the

322
00:19:02,789 --> 00:19:07,369
going through this drive the two could
drive in film to driving through Aspen

323
00:19:07,369 --> 00:19:11,019
and this would actually be displayed
back to you in the system

324
00:19:11,019 --> 00:19:15,109
and this is the precursor to augmented
reality and its also the precursor to

325
00:19:15,109 --> 00:19:16,340
Google Maps

326
00:19:16,340 --> 00:19:19,799
in Google Street View and things that
just now

327
00:19:19,799 --> 00:19:24,899
are really starting to come into popular
usage on in the nineteen seventies

328
00:19:24,899 --> 00:19:28,340
an artist name myron krueger are created
a place

329
00:19:28,340 --> 00:19:31,988
called video please this was the
combination several different projects

330
00:19:31,989 --> 00:19:34,989
on what he called artificial reality

331
00:19:34,989 --> 00:19:39,049
and so this was housed in a research lab
in connecticut and

332
00:19:39,049 --> 00:19:42,179
are it was utilize multiple video
cameras

333
00:19:42,179 --> 00:19:45,940
and projections so that you could move
your body

334
00:19:45,940 --> 00:19:50,669
and as you move your body you played
around with these abstract shapes and

335
00:19:50,669 --> 00:19:51,470
colors

336
00:19:51,470 --> 00:19:55,889
you could draw with your hands you know
this is the seventies this is before any

337
00:19:55,889 --> 00:19:56,799
type of like

338
00:19:56,799 --> 00:20:00,980
are major computer usage or anything
like that

339
00:20:00,980 --> 00:20:05,879
enter then later on as you get into the
eighties you can into the key for TV did

340
00:20:05,879 --> 00:20:07,279
virtual environment

341
00:20:07,279 --> 00:20:10,720
this is richly developed at the electron
tricia was Asian land at universal donor

342
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:12,139
in Chicago

343
00:20:12,139 --> 00:20:15,210
and it was multiple cameras our screens

344
00:20:15,210 --> 00:20:19,320
a combined with motion tracking software
to create an immersive environment

345
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:22,649
and are was actually wanted universal
Michigan

346
00:20:22,649 --> 00:20:26,029
up until recently where I do stuff are

347
00:20:26,029 --> 00:20:30,049
and the risk peabody dozen different
keep installations throughout the United

348
00:20:30,049 --> 00:20:30,820
States

349
00:20:30,820 --> 00:20:35,149
throughout the eighties and nineties and
do something about keep his then

350
00:20:35,149 --> 00:20:38,659
are the development he eventually led to
some

351
00:20:38,659 --> 00:20:42,429
open source virtual reality and
augmented reality libraries

352
00:20:42,429 --> 00:20:46,899
and frameworks that are still being
maintained by people today

353
00:20:46,899 --> 00:20:50,479
forward are developing these types and
environments and you can actually

354
00:20:50,479 --> 00:20:53,470
joined the group in help with the
environment the development these

355
00:20:53,470 --> 00:20:54,220
environment

356
00:20:54,220 --> 00:20:57,519
libraries and frameworks still

357
00:20:57,519 --> 00:21:01,710
mid-course fans for even more in get
Second Life the second wife of course is

358
00:21:01,710 --> 00:21:01,979
a

359
00:21:01,979 --> 00:21:06,100
commercial virtual environment created
by Linden Labs in San Francisco

360
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:10,139
our users can build anything from
primitives you did your avatar

361
00:21:10,139 --> 00:21:14,440
takes a primitive you can stack all
these permits to create complex objects

362
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:17,440
and to you are

363
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:21,799
interacts with other things objects
could be scripted secure touch an object

364
00:21:21,799 --> 00:21:25,119
things can happen or if you bump objects
together are

365
00:21:25,119 --> 00:21:28,609
you can make things happen there's also
a Web Services API

366
00:21:28,609 --> 00:21:32,210
in this was really unique in terms of
virtual environments because there was

367
00:21:32,210 --> 00:21:35,369
no other environments at the time and
Stewart really

368
00:21:35,369 --> 00:21:39,109
are that allow you to interact directly
with the real world

369
00:21:39,109 --> 00:21:44,239
so it's very easy to create tools to
interact with the real world

370
00:21:44,239 --> 00:21:49,220
answer Nora dissect augmented in virtual
reality really quick

371
00:21:49,220 --> 00:21:52,989
arm those couple things that you should
always have considered rules

372
00:21:52,989 --> 00:21:57,159
that define the interaction if necessary
provide in rule clues as to how

373
00:21:57,159 --> 00:21:59,179
interaction should happen

374
00:21:59,179 --> 00:22:02,929
are you should be constrained to limited
interaction for particular purpose

375
00:22:02,929 --> 00:22:06,200
should be multiple sensory moods to
increase immersion

376
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:10,350
so the more things that you have visual
things in auditory things

377
00:22:10,350 --> 00:22:14,919
in touch you're more likely to have
someone feeling immersed

378
00:22:14,919 --> 00:22:18,789
and this is the basic event loop year
you want to

379
00:22:18,789 --> 00:22:21,889
sample inputs from your devices

380
00:22:21,889 --> 00:22:25,299
you wanna for input devices you want a
process that data

381
00:22:25,299 --> 00:22:28,889
you wanna update the environment and
then we'd another cycle

382
00:22:28,889 --> 00:22:32,379
before you read now for sampling yeah

383
00:22:32,379 --> 00:22:36,269
essentially you take a reading from each
input are to get its current value

384
00:22:36,269 --> 00:22:39,470
sampling rate should be appropriate for
the input the environment in the user's

385
00:22:39,470 --> 00:22:43,409
you once the one simple too fast or too
slow to be lag

386
00:22:43,409 --> 00:22:48,169
arm each sample should be timestamps I
and many stored in a buffer

387
00:22:48,169 --> 00:22:52,600
do whatever you want to do with it you
can read it back to disk for recording

388
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:56,559
process the dated to use it to do
whatever you want to do with the

389
00:22:56,559 --> 00:22:57,720
environment

390
00:22:57,720 --> 00:23:01,729
on and perform operations then update
your environment

391
00:23:01,729 --> 00:23:06,159
individual updates you update audio keep
in mind that when you update audio you

392
00:23:06,159 --> 00:23:07,340
change all your things

393
00:23:07,340 --> 00:23:10,499
so the same things changing something
visually it's harder for someone did

394
00:23:10,499 --> 00:23:15,299
on to really make sense is changing
audio very quickly

395
00:23:15,299 --> 00:23:18,600
and provide tactile feedback you know
visual feedback

396
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:22,340
highlight something Flickr bounce in
sound click buzz

397
00:23:22,340 --> 00:23:26,509
Voice attacked I'm like vibration or you
can modify the resistance

398
00:23:26,509 --> 00:23:30,279
something and I put smell here with the
question mark

399
00:23:30,279 --> 00:23:33,609
even since Morton high legs work arm

400
00:23:33,609 --> 00:23:36,999
with smell there's not been anything
else would smell

401
00:23:36,999 --> 00:23:41,609
and I encourage folks out here to get
involved with smell and see what you can

402
00:23:41,609 --> 00:23:43,149
do to try to

403
00:23:43,149 --> 00:23:47,460
are create ways of creating a sense of
smell in people's experiences

404
00:23:47,460 --> 00:23:51,019
so we talk a little bit about DIY
virtual not mince reality systems really

405
00:23:51,019 --> 00:23:52,320
quick

406
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:56,210
so you can use really available hardware
such as laptops and mobile devices

407
00:23:56,210 --> 00:24:00,399
you can use low-cost off-the-shelf
sensors new allies standards that are

408
00:24:00,399 --> 00:24:02,759
out there for data formats in
communication

409
00:24:02,759 --> 00:24:07,879
you can design an environment based on
personal creativity

410
00:24:07,879 --> 00:24:11,249
for creating the environment for
something called x3 view this is the pre

411
00:24:11,249 --> 00:24:15,820
uttered actually it's the modern version
but was VRML in the nineties

412
00:24:15,820 --> 00:24:19,549
on this is a modeling this is a

413
00:24:19,549 --> 00:24:23,529
model in which just like serve HTML
sorts tagged

414
00:24:23,529 --> 00:24:28,759
are or just like a kimono aren't so this
is basically just you never text

415
00:24:28,759 --> 00:24:29,549
document

416
00:24:29,549 --> 00:24:33,929
and have tags and put in information to
those tags and create a virtual

417
00:24:33,929 --> 00:24:34,830
environment

418
00:24:34,830 --> 00:24:39,509
maintained by the web 3d consortium arts
a large community of

419
00:24:39,509 --> 00:24:43,679
standards development and support and
it's used in

420
00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:46,999
pretty much everything a training
modeling whatever

421
00:24:46,999 --> 00:24:50,179
you can design things and second life as
we talked about it has all those

422
00:24:50,179 --> 00:24:53,919
things are such as the Web Services API
I'm

423
00:24:53,919 --> 00:24:57,529
answer land can be purchased or it can

424
00:24:57,529 --> 00:25:00,489
are you can be free if you don't have
real and you can just navigate through

425
00:25:00,489 --> 00:25:01,509
their

426
00:25:01,509 --> 00:25:05,919
and I work with panoramic photography
large panoramic photography is when you

427
00:25:05,919 --> 00:25:07,499
take pictures

428
00:25:07,499 --> 00:25:11,899
are and either take up to one large
picture that covers a lot of

429
00:25:11,899 --> 00:25:16,149
large field of view we can take smaller
pictures and stack them together

430
00:25:16,149 --> 00:25:19,669
no ski pass the slides on how to do them
but you'll be able to get all these

431
00:25:19,669 --> 00:25:22,369
information are all the different slides
that I have

432
00:25:22,369 --> 00:25:25,929
as well some software and whatnot will
be available up on

433
00:25:25,929 --> 00:25:29,919
the website that'll provide for you in
this life should be up on the web page

434
00:25:29,919 --> 00:25:31,789
is well

435
00:25:31,789 --> 00:25:36,720
student loans accelerometers for sense
resistors

436
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:41,599
are no those few things the XR 100 for
sense resistors you can she get this

437
00:25:41,599 --> 00:25:43,168
right leader fruit and stuff

438
00:25:43,169 --> 00:25:47,909
for ten dollars thirteen dollars in all
these things are very useful

439
00:25:47,909 --> 00:25:51,139
for on it now creating your own virtual
environment

440
00:25:51,139 --> 00:25:55,200
because cameras are really cheap now are
in build one phones

441
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:59,179
microphones very cheap bill one phones
you can also buy

442
00:25:59,179 --> 00:26:02,809
external microphones Chris GPS

443
00:26:02,809 --> 00:26:07,059
in all the phones you buy cheap external
GPS and across the drina one people

444
00:26:07,059 --> 00:26:08,309
you're familiar with the Arduino

445
00:26:08,309 --> 00:26:11,379
there'd be no can be utilized are two

446
00:26:11,379 --> 00:26:15,320
I'll capture sensor information and then
send it to

447
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:19,570
an application and across the ubiquitous
laptop

448
00:26:19,570 --> 00:26:24,049
everyone has a laptop in the laptop so
today have more power in them

449
00:26:24,049 --> 00:26:28,029
the virtual reality systems are the
nineties and the canteen the cameras and

450
00:26:28,029 --> 00:26:29,559
microphones and everything

451
00:26:29,559 --> 00:26:34,129
built right in so me close up by talking
news but some projects that I've done

452
00:26:34,129 --> 00:26:35,869
with these things

453
00:26:35,869 --> 00:26:40,210
so I used in a man event consequential
progression 2004

454
00:26:40,210 --> 00:26:47,210
are utilized to p5 virtual reality gore
which is this right here in Orem

455
00:26:48,639 --> 00:26:53,190
rounds really well that was designed by
a company

456
00:26:53,190 --> 00:26:56,690
in the late 90s call the century I'll do
you do when a business

457
00:26:56,690 --> 00:27:00,049
9 data buying the remaining stock up
gloves are

458
00:27:00,049 --> 00:27:03,820
in so I'm work with his clothes X was
killed in world

459
00:27:03,820 --> 00:27:07,119
fits over your hands does XYZ also
banned

460
00:27:07,119 --> 00:27:10,289
and has triggers so I used it was %uh
biking

461
00:27:10,289 --> 00:27:13,349
used to control me soon and also

462
00:27:13,349 --> 00:27:17,700
connected with the open sound control
protocol which is an open protocol

463
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:21,129
for sending sound information over the
Internet and friends of mine in

464
00:27:21,129 --> 00:27:24,739
Australia were utilizing the glove to
control information

465
00:27:24,739 --> 00:27:29,299
actually in our performance space so
they're in Australia moving their hands

466
00:27:29,299 --> 00:27:33,070
affecting things happening in our
performance space I did something called

467
00:27:33,070 --> 00:27:36,700
the virtual spaces project ans was
designed for a conference

468
00:27:36,700 --> 00:27:39,909
universal mission called single-sex
newswise

469
00:27:39,909 --> 00:27:43,879
utilize the p5 virtual-reality glow with
QuickTime virtual-reality

470
00:27:43,879 --> 00:27:48,359
panoramic photography in sound to create
an immersive environment

471
00:27:48,359 --> 00:27:52,259
very inexpensive cost me under 100
dollars to put together

472
00:27:52,259 --> 00:27:55,399
but it really work you can see people
here in these pictures are

473
00:27:55,399 --> 00:28:00,450
immersed you're interested and most
importantly is this last picture here

474
00:28:00,450 --> 00:28:03,879
my becomes wonder and joy because
everyone is laughing

475
00:28:03,879 --> 00:28:08,330
and the young cute on the right was just
means to spend about fifteen minutes

476
00:28:08,330 --> 00:28:11,559
just navigating through this and was
completely just

477
00:28:11,559 --> 00:28:15,099
innocence upon wonder is beautiful and I
did some work

478
00:28:15,099 --> 00:28:18,299
with a second life in music class for
students in

479
00:28:18,299 --> 00:28:22,009
a great school were able to play music
under instruments

480
00:28:22,009 --> 00:28:26,469
that was streamed in the Second Life in
users in Second Life could interact with

481
00:28:26,469 --> 00:28:27,450
each other

482
00:28:27,450 --> 00:28:32,639
in also here the students performing and
select different streams from different

483
00:28:32,639 --> 00:28:34,109
students

484
00:28:34,109 --> 00:28:38,619
and gonna do show last year are with my
band products explore

485
00:28:38,619 --> 00:28:41,729
are Bentall would have circled on the
horizon

486
00:28:41,729 --> 00:28:45,919
which was a it was an event that utilize
the p5+1 trailed a glove to control

487
00:28:45,919 --> 00:28:46,899
QuickTime VR

488
00:28:46,899 --> 00:28:50,809
lights and sound so as I moved my hand

489
00:28:50,809 --> 00:28:54,229
I was manipulating things in the
environment you know

490
00:28:54,229 --> 00:28:57,340
sure you the quick video this means

491
00:28:57,340 --> 00:29:04,340
scroll through

492
00:29:15,540 --> 00:29:19,908
in

493
00:29:19,909 --> 00:29:25,450
you can actually use the world modified
Shahi

494
00:29:25,450 --> 00:29:32,279
and also be advocating virtual reality
panorama in all shapeshift even like in

495
00:29:32,279 --> 00:29:32,639
this

496
00:29:32,639 --> 00:29:36,389
environment music and being behind me he
also added dancers

497
00:29:36,389 --> 00:29:43,389
I am open the System Preferences she did
as the movie produced written

498
00:29:43,850 --> 00:29:49,739
and a seasonally he seemed newsroom
panoramic virtual-reality

499
00:29:49,739 --> 00:29:55,019
movie she noted how do you choose delete

500
00:29:55,019 --> 00:30:00,239
nice the b2b and I also have an amp

501
00:30:00,239 --> 00:30:04,679
then I wrote specifically for the sons
were short on time and wanna make sure

502
00:30:04,679 --> 00:30:08,859
that everyone gets their full amount of
time to speak only demonstrate this

503
00:30:08,859 --> 00:30:11,999
for you very briefly may actually wrote
in an app

504
00:30:11,999 --> 00:30:15,249
for this presentation its

505
00:30:15,249 --> 00:30:19,239
augmented reality you you're so do

506
00:30:19,239 --> 00:30:24,090
so we're is missus and Arduino

507
00:30:24,090 --> 00:30:29,549
brightness is a small electronics
project kit you can actually get these

508
00:30:29,549 --> 00:30:33,399
arm the down on the mezzanine there's
several

509
00:30:33,399 --> 00:30:37,690
groups that are some weird renews its I
think 30 bucks or something like that if

510
00:30:37,690 --> 00:30:38,249
you even

511
00:30:38,249 --> 00:30:41,590
our hands the nerve also got a

512
00:30:41,590 --> 00:30:44,999
force resistance sensor right here

513
00:30:44,999 --> 00:30:49,289
basically as you push this in actually

514
00:30:49,289 --> 00:30:53,580
creates a pressure on the sensor which
then

515
00:30:53,580 --> 00:30:57,249
can be read by a dr dre you know mm good
sense

516
00:30:57,249 --> 00:31:00,539
to a computer imus

517
00:31:00,539 --> 00:31:04,799
I also have this right here

518
00:31:04,799 --> 00:31:07,830
which is an accelerometer and

519
00:31:07,830 --> 00:31:13,399
the accelerometer is XYZ catches motion
XYZ this little thing

520
00:31:13,399 --> 00:31:17,019
so you could put it on your hand put on
your arm put on other parts your body

521
00:31:17,019 --> 00:31:21,590
where Dahmer and move and actually send
that information to control the things

522
00:31:21,590 --> 00:31:22,359
this is

523
00:31:22,359 --> 00:31:28,389
I think thirteen dollars a different
some

524
00:31:28,389 --> 00:31:32,019
that information gets sent to a lab
tumbled go over the technical details

525
00:31:32,019 --> 00:31:35,399
real quick if its earnings all-rounder
cling to their dream

526
00:31:35,399 --> 00:31:39,359
your to reno's connected to laptop via
USB to provide serial communication

527
00:31:39,359 --> 00:31:45,190
I do the same Mac OS are and so there's
an AB can search session which is a

528
00:31:45,190 --> 00:31:48,570
and object to that reads information
from your camera

529
00:31:48,570 --> 00:31:53,408
are and then there's also layer that
displays that in the application

530
00:31:53,409 --> 00:31:56,549
ans arm them

531
00:31:56,549 --> 00:32:00,259
there's a serial controller closely open
that opens a serial connection

532
00:32:00,259 --> 00:32:04,340
this rain here rehear which is connected
to the Arduino

533
00:32:04,340 --> 00:32:08,559
in allows the computer to read
information from there to be no

534
00:32:08,559 --> 00:32:13,129
and then overlay that over a visual
image so what's if I can do this really

535
00:32:13,129 --> 00:32:16,109
quick I don't want to cut into the time
with the other folks

536
00:32:16,109 --> 00:32:19,159
much more we got a late start
regrettably

537
00:32:19,159 --> 00:32:26,159
but would see if I can do this real
quick here

538
00:32:42,649 --> 00:32:46,210
mmm freeze on me

539
00:32:46,210 --> 00:32:53,210
Maria

540
00:33:04,190 --> 00:33:11,190
some

541
00:33:13,820 --> 00:33:20,230
sorry this is taking little bit I'm you
know came

542
00:33:20,230 --> 00:33:24,049
so here you actually woohoo okay there
you go

543
00:33:24,049 --> 00:33:27,650
so actually women this is the force
resistance sensor

544
00:33:27,650 --> 00:33:30,960
into that numbered scrolling 80 as a

545
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:35,700
apply pressure you see the number
increases as it scrolls by

546
00:33:35,700 --> 00:33:40,260
missus me right here room so you could
have

547
00:33:40,260 --> 00:33:43,679
this camera in this art reno

548
00:33:43,679 --> 00:33:47,409
is taking information from sensors and
then

549
00:33:47,409 --> 00:33:51,970
overlaying your over the image this is
DIY augmented reality you can't get this

550
00:33:51,970 --> 00:33:55,110
and put this together included for under
100 bucks

551
00:33:55,110 --> 00:33:58,580
in your only limited by your imagination

552
00:33:58,580 --> 00:34:02,480
by what you can do with this are very
inexpensive

553
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:05,730
technology now this code is going to be
up

554
00:34:05,730 --> 00:34:09,210
on the website as well as well as
documentation on

555
00:34:09,210 --> 00:34:13,210
how I did everything are in the project
everything will be there

556
00:34:13,210 --> 00:34:16,540
for you to be able to learn from this
are

557
00:34:16,540 --> 00:34:21,969
in creating yourself and explore I'm in
a few closing statements before we get

558
00:34:21,970 --> 00:34:22,669
to him

559
00:34:22,668 --> 00:34:25,770
our next speaker's bounce back in here

560
00:34:25,770 --> 00:34:29,139
so a few more comments on this arm

561
00:34:29,139 --> 00:34:32,970
new technologies make all projects
better oh that you moved on before you

562
00:34:32,970 --> 00:34:34,820
can create new inspired projects

563
00:34:34,820 --> 00:34:38,710
and the growth maker culture means that
the there's a new development cycle to

564
00:34:38,710 --> 00:34:42,690
the development cycle these technologies
will speed up more more people getting

565
00:34:42,690 --> 00:34:45,190
involved in creating electronics home
electronics

566
00:34:45,190 --> 00:34:48,720
in so on in virtual reality you're gonna
expand quite a bit

567
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:53,429
handle there are several presentations
here at home

568
00:34:53,429 --> 00:34:56,990
that talk about arm people

569
00:34:56,990 --> 00:35:00,970
exploring individual electronics
creation

570
00:35:00,970 --> 00:35:05,480
and of course the connect owner came out
a lot of people using that for

571
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:09,070
virtual and augmented reality our
concern only jaron Lanier

572
00:35:09,070 --> 00:35:12,580
is actually we the people involved are
he's actually on contract

573
00:35:12,580 --> 00:35:16,348
to Microsoft to do the connect to the
approached him and said hey

574
00:35:16,349 --> 00:35:20,170
if really gave you the resources could
you come up with something and he did

575
00:35:20,170 --> 00:35:24,880
arm him so there's something that just
happened recently

576
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:29,450
in the past couple weeks John Carmack
came up with something called

577
00:35:29,450 --> 00:35:33,848
oculus ripped he's trying to make an
under 500 dollars

578
00:35:33,849 --> 00:35:36,980
virtual display Virtual Reality Display

579
00:35:36,980 --> 00:35:40,820
I anyone's to make the first kits
available to makers

580
00:35:40,820 --> 00:35:45,300
in hackers people like you so many have
a link to it or you can google oculus

581
00:35:45,300 --> 00:35:45,980
rift

582
00:35:45,980 --> 00:35:49,400
this is really cool he wants people
creating

583
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:52,580
their own each Indies and manipulating
their own

584
00:35:52,580 --> 00:35:56,240
head-mounted displays and of course the
XP radio switch

585
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:59,500
you'll see a demonstration own are
actually

586
00:35:59,500 --> 00:36:03,040
reviews that would allow you did avoid
having this cable

587
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:06,529
in actually just have a nerd renew and
sensors on a body

588
00:36:06,530 --> 00:36:10,119
and beat people to be able to
communicate and have augmented and

589
00:36:10,119 --> 00:36:11,160
virtual reality

590
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:15,020
in communication that way and again the
materials will be up

591
00:36:15,020 --> 00:36:18,750
on the website and that's going to be
its sensory research dotnet

592
00:36:18,750 --> 00:36:23,390
slash hope number nine and now we're
going to move over to mom

593
00:36:23,390 --> 00:36:26,750
our next on talk here

594
00:36:26,750 --> 00:36:31,339
be bringing up in

595
00:36:31,339 --> 00:36:38,339
remove things are a little bit just so
that

596
00:36:43,140 --> 00:36:47,368
whom test

597
00:36:47,369 --> 00:36:50,730
ok should prisons

598
00:36:50,730 --> 00:36:57,730
is scholarship now

599
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:04,000
sorry just need space for all these
fucking devices enhance

600
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:09,170
and K how many devices to the take to do
with ok

601
00:37:09,170 --> 00:37:16,170
okay

602
00:37:25,020 --> 00:37:26,910
again

603
00:37:26,910 --> 00:37:28,299
hi

604
00:37:28,300 --> 00:37:30,960
my name's Michigan s and I'm

605
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:34,220
I'm really honored to be here thanks for
inviting me back

606
00:37:34,220 --> 00:37:38,030
after after last year's shenanigans and
too excited to be back

607
00:37:38,030 --> 00:37:43,369
anyway I love hope I'm hacking was
actually pretty much the way I got into

608
00:37:43,369 --> 00:37:46,630
politics & hmm

609
00:37:46,630 --> 00:37:50,000
anyway long old loves me so I'm

610
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:53,849
by talking about this project I'm doing
call local autonomy networks

611
00:37:53,849 --> 00:37:57,619
fashion hacking for social
reorganization and

612
00:37:57,619 --> 00:38:01,359
celebrated here I can see in your view
except for you and then later

613
00:38:01,359 --> 00:38:07,020
okay and and so it's a project about
making at lineup mesh networks clothing

614
00:38:07,020 --> 00:38:09,009
and trying to you can create networks

615
00:38:09,010 --> 00:38:12,240
up safety for women and LGBT people and
people color

616
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:16,320
but I want Starbucks mezzo my
inspirations for the credit to how I got

617
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:16,859
there

618
00:38:16,859 --> 00:38:21,390
to working on it and then talk about
some other experiments that have been

619
00:38:21,390 --> 00:38:24,000
doing in the project over the past year
and

620
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:31,000
future plans

621
00:38:33,110 --> 00:38:36,690
really real okay

622
00:38:36,690 --> 00:38:40,410
a not that one this one

623
00:38:40,410 --> 00:38:43,490
so as my mommy

624
00:38:43,490 --> 00:38:46,670
on one my inspirations absolutely

625
00:38:46,670 --> 00:38:50,350
I'm so moms getting older now she's in
her seventies in ashes to use a

626
00:38:50,350 --> 00:38:51,710
wheelchair to get around

627
00:38:51,710 --> 00:38:56,030
and I was really thrilled to see the
panel before s and so excited to see

628
00:38:56,030 --> 00:38:56,980
people talking about

629
00:38:56,980 --> 00:39:00,770
illness and disability in relation to
hacking and in relation to what we can

630
00:39:00,770 --> 00:39:01,580
do about it

631
00:39:01,580 --> 00:39:05,420
and really criticizing the concept of
illness and who gets to be

632
00:39:05,420 --> 00:39:10,730
who gets the deemed ill are not and
because I was also a schizophrenic

633
00:39:10,730 --> 00:39:14,150
and she's a breast cancer survivor and
she may have in common they were both

634
00:39:14,150 --> 00:39:15,680
diagnosed with mental illness

635
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:18,700
because being transgender is still
considered an illness in the United

636
00:39:18,700 --> 00:39:19,530
States

637
00:39:19,530 --> 00:39:22,990
and so that's when I was diagnosed with
even though I would say it's a gift

638
00:39:22,990 --> 00:39:26,210
and not an illness I'm cermak

639
00:39:26,210 --> 00:39:30,730
I'm ok that's nice

640
00:39:30,730 --> 00:39:34,190
a.m. so my question for us tonight is

641
00:39:34,190 --> 00:39:37,540
are today is as we're creating the
future of technology thinking about

642
00:39:37,540 --> 00:39:41,430
things like transhumanism are augmented
bodies are poz unionism or whenever we

643
00:39:41,430 --> 00:39:42,069
want to call it

644
00:39:42,070 --> 00:39:46,470
why isn't there we are so often
presented with the image of things like

645
00:39:46,470 --> 00:39:49,100
contact lenses with embedded the
computer displays in them

646
00:39:49,100 --> 00:39:54,390
and not with images like wheelchairs
prescription drugs prescription hormones

647
00:39:54,390 --> 00:39:57,500
and lipstick why don't we think about
those things I think about I meant and

648
00:39:57,500 --> 00:39:58,250
bodies right

649
00:39:58,250 --> 00:40:03,040
why is it that one above those set
images is a midget marginalization

650
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:07,210
and the other one is the said images of
the future me and

651
00:40:07,210 --> 00:40:10,890
you related to that question sorry if
something some enlightening talk

652
00:40:10,890 --> 00:40:15,240
is all mine into a few people okay there
will be some repetition

653
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:18,720
I'm sorry you can plan your phone in
that time um

654
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:22,270
so n really question is the

655
00:40:22,270 --> 00:40:26,350
why is it to me a better technology to
share pictures about we have for lunch

656
00:40:26,350 --> 00:40:30,190
or down our favorite TV shows then we do
to keep each other sane why is that

657
00:40:30,190 --> 00:40:34,190
what with the priorities there that
result in those things because

658
00:40:34,190 --> 00:40:37,290
I am sexual assault is a real problem

659
00:40:37,290 --> 00:40:40,100
something talk about sexual thought
missed target that's triggering to you

660
00:40:40,100 --> 00:40:41,089
you should maybe

661
00:40:41,090 --> 00:40:44,680
that now that was a warning

662
00:40:44,680 --> 00:40:51,009
I'm gonna talk about it here comes the
sexual assault is a real

663
00:40:51,010 --> 00:40:54,220
a current existing met massive problem

664
00:40:54,220 --> 00:40:57,710
writing solicited sex or something like
one in six women

665
00:40:57,710 --> 00:41:01,960
has been sexually assaulted but combined
with the statistic that only

666
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:06,180
about fifty percent of assaults are ever
reported that means we can say

667
00:41:06,180 --> 00:41:10,540
a lot more than one in six women rain
and something like one in 33 min

668
00:41:10,540 --> 00:41:14,029
so on it's something I'm really

669
00:41:14,030 --> 00:41:17,380
thinking about because I'm am a survivor
sexual violence

670
00:41:17,380 --> 00:41:21,260
and also because I feel like people in
my community

671
00:41:21,260 --> 00:41:24,490
like trans women are very often the
subject further

672
00:41:24,490 --> 00:41:28,020
target love hate crimes and particular
women of color like me

673
00:41:28,020 --> 00:41:31,270
transgender women of color like the
number one victim love hate crimes

674
00:41:31,270 --> 00:41:34,440
so this happens all the time and its

675
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:38,240
I'm tired religious of on

676
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:41,690
and you know the more I read about
technology news and I read every month

677
00:41:41,690 --> 00:41:43,460
at another black trans woman was killed

678
00:41:43,460 --> 00:41:47,560
really disturbs me so many martel was
killed in Oakland this year in 2012

679
00:41:47,560 --> 00:41:51,870
and also relevant to this discussion was

680
00:41:51,870 --> 00:41:55,080
me a month after Brandon Marshall was
killed in Oakland

681
00:41:55,080 --> 00:41:58,180
season Donald was another black trans
woman

682
00:41:58,180 --> 00:42:01,310
who was attacked but she fight back

683
00:42:01,310 --> 00:42:04,910
successfully and sage online and as a
result she's in prison

684
00:42:04,910 --> 00:42:09,330
a so this project I'm working on local
autonomy networks

685
00:42:09,330 --> 00:42:14,120
thinks about how we can collectively
respond to violence and prevent violence

686
00:42:14,120 --> 00:42:19,230
I am so excuse me for the slanting

687
00:42:19,230 --> 00:42:23,730
our order buttons get back okay so there
was a

688
00:42:23,730 --> 00:42:26,920
finish some inspirations there that it
too long and I'm gonna go a little

689
00:42:26,920 --> 00:42:27,430
faster

690
00:42:27,430 --> 00:42:31,190
so another main way that I got to
working on this project was

691
00:42:31,190 --> 00:42:34,240
I worked previously on this project
called the transborder immigrant tool

692
00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:37,630
and we're done with electronic to
service leader in the ban Lam

693
00:42:37,630 --> 00:42:41,290
and this was a project that we were done
to take

694
00:42:41,290 --> 00:42:45,110
cheap cell phones up at the bay and try
to turn them into life-saving devices

695
00:42:45,110 --> 00:42:47,330
for people crossing the us-mexico border

696
00:42:47,330 --> 00:42:51,270
by writing software that would allow
people to access a GPS on phones

697
00:42:51,270 --> 00:42:55,440
to find water cashes in the desert
without having cell phone service

698
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:59,380
so go on their project was to

699
00:42:59,380 --> 00:43:02,320
make the suns and distributed them to
people about to cross the us-mexico

700
00:43:02,320 --> 00:43:03,080
border

701
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:08,720
I'm after three different investigations
and Ricardo almost losing ten year

702
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:11,930
and the FBI showing up at our door we've
not yet

703
00:43:11,930 --> 00:43:16,980
distributed phones I'm because you told
that this jury in them is the real crime

704
00:43:16,980 --> 00:43:20,960
nobody's ever use them but us but we
have plans a disturbing them this month

705
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:24,630
am and for this summer so anyway keep an
eye out for that

706
00:43:24,630 --> 00:43:28,680
but working on the translating into a
was a big inspiration for me because

707
00:43:28,680 --> 00:43:33,600
the electronic disturbance near has
proposed this idea they call science and

708
00:43:33,600 --> 00:43:35,120
the oppressed

709
00:43:35,120 --> 00:43:38,230
actually term coined mine by many
critique

710
00:43:38,230 --> 00:43:42,680
and and is related to a lot of other
ideas like for QoS idea subjugated

711
00:43:42,680 --> 00:43:43,509
knowledge

712
00:43:43,510 --> 00:43:47,730
or and so do with the idea of
consistency and the Elemis de ser

713
00:43:47,730 --> 00:43:51,510
I'm or I wanna I'm a fan of his fam
science

714
00:43:51,510 --> 00:43:55,880
and these ideas are like thinking about
how science could be different for how

715
00:43:55,880 --> 00:43:58,540
knowledge production could be different
if it wasn't shaped

716
00:43:58,540 --> 00:44:02,410
by their desires and interests
corporations and corporate funders and

717
00:44:02,410 --> 00:44:03,879
profit motivations

718
00:44:03,880 --> 00:44:07,840
but instead was a way of responding to
and preventing oppression

719
00:44:07,840 --> 00:44:11,800
so taking experiences a violent and
marginalization or homophobia

720
00:44:11,800 --> 00:44:15,160
which experience every day and turning
that into

721
00:44:15,160 --> 00:44:18,740
a kind of knowledge right ok I know is
that not everybody has

722
00:44:18,740 --> 00:44:21,810
that allows me and other oppressed
people to

723
00:44:21,810 --> 00:44:28,590
I'm think different problem

724
00:44:28,590 --> 00:44:32,840
okay so saying to the president from
science okay another in this

725
00:44:32,840 --> 00:44:36,140
so one other thing they let me this
project was on

726
00:44:36,140 --> 00:44:40,129
sitting in his idea love them science I
want to put it together with some skills

727
00:44:40,130 --> 00:44:41,130
that I had

728
00:44:41,130 --> 00:44:44,190
like working on wearable electronics so

729
00:44:44,190 --> 00:44:47,980
I'm if you saw are rowdy panel last year

730
00:44:47,980 --> 00:44:51,190
and then you saw some of my work that
was

731
00:44:51,190 --> 00:44:55,300
performance art work using wearable
electronics and biometric sensors in

732
00:44:55,300 --> 00:44:56,530
motion capture

733
00:44:56,530 --> 00:45:00,660
I am to kinda interface our bodies to
Second Life

734
00:45:00,660 --> 00:45:04,330
while we were doing erotic acts me and
my partner at the moment

735
00:45:04,330 --> 00:45:07,650
and in so

736
00:45:07,650 --> 00:45:11,060
we made love devices like a thrust
sensing glove

737
00:45:11,060 --> 00:45:14,790
that would change the speed of dildos
based on the amount of trust

738
00:45:14,790 --> 00:45:20,470
I'm or proximity sensing bra which is
the one that's in this picture

739
00:45:20,470 --> 00:45:23,910
and they can detect the difference
between the two of us and change the

740
00:45:23,910 --> 00:45:25,620
call you sound audiences hearing

741
00:45:25,620 --> 00:45:30,450
or move I am ties and second-ranked
based on that distance

742
00:45:30,450 --> 00:45:33,920
so I read much about that and for the
source code for that in my book the

743
00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:38,740
trans real so if you're interested now
feel free to follow that up

744
00:45:38,740 --> 00:45:41,770
okay so one last inspiration that led me
to this project

745
00:45:41,770 --> 00:45:46,020
look what I mean it works was going to
Columbia to my followers from Columbia

746
00:45:46,020 --> 00:45:48,170
and I went there for this performance
art thing

747
00:45:48,170 --> 00:45:51,620
and I was really really moved by

748
00:45:51,620 --> 00:45:56,450
and this performance by but the 70
something concerning

749
00:45:56,450 --> 00:46:00,440
I'm or by meeting people who had friends
who were disappeared

750
00:46:00,440 --> 00:46:03,690
because it all over Latin America it's a
major problem that

751
00:46:03,690 --> 00:46:07,260
am governments kidnap people and largely
because the drug war

752
00:46:07,260 --> 00:46:10,300
largely because the government in
Columbia gets more money based on the

753
00:46:10,300 --> 00:46:11,890
number of guerrillas they present

754
00:46:11,890 --> 00:46:15,350
miss only kidnap college kids and kill
them adjust them up as guerrillas and

755
00:46:15,350 --> 00:46:16,910
then they get more money

756
00:46:16,910 --> 00:46:20,359
and so this was an issue that I really
want to work on

757
00:46:20,360 --> 00:46:24,440
is like people being disappeared or you
know the women what is

758
00:46:24,440 --> 00:46:27,580
people talk about that like as if it was
only have the family size only happen in

759
00:46:27,580 --> 00:46:31,940
the nineties but they're still happening
just as much as they work

760
00:46:31,940 --> 00:46:35,190
so I saw his performance about these
issues all these women had

761
00:46:35,190 --> 00:46:40,470
had their husbands disappeared by the by
who knows him

762
00:46:40,470 --> 00:46:45,110
so subpoenas spence together I started
thinking how can I okay that's

763
00:46:45,110 --> 00:46:48,730
10 minutes so I probably have maybe 10
to 15 more min

764
00:46:48,730 --> 00:46:52,420
um so with those expenses re-thinking
okay

765
00:46:52,420 --> 00:46:56,000
so happy I'm a starting safety devices
for myself my community so that when I

766
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:57,930
walk home at night I could feel a little
safer

767
00:46:57,930 --> 00:47:01,169
and not feel like I'm being hunted and
something horrible had happened to me

768
00:47:01,170 --> 00:47:04,260
which often is how I feel walking home
at nine

769
00:47:04,260 --> 00:47:09,250
and I so I thought okay I could make
some wearable electronic safety devices

770
00:47:09,250 --> 00:47:13,570
and first my plan was to use GPS module

771
00:47:13,570 --> 00:47:16,980
and done things like pressure sensor
some really interested in making devices

772
00:47:16,980 --> 00:47:17,940
that are like

773
00:47:17,940 --> 00:47:21,880
easily triggered on pardon the pun

774
00:47:21,880 --> 00:47:25,390
but they were easily activated I because

775
00:47:25,390 --> 00:47:28,879
you know there's this already Maps for
iPhone that are like I never walk alone

776
00:47:28,880 --> 00:47:29,430
or whatever

777
00:47:29,430 --> 00:47:33,259
writers absent you can set up your list
of contacts and if you're if you

778
00:47:33,260 --> 00:47:36,100
act press the big red button and it
tells all your friends that you need

779
00:47:36,100 --> 00:47:36,930
help

780
00:47:36,930 --> 00:47:41,049
but I'm you know if you really are in a
moment need then

781
00:47:41,050 --> 00:47:45,120
sliding slider and type in your passcode
is probably not something that you can

782
00:47:45,120 --> 00:47:45,500
do

783
00:47:45,500 --> 00:47:49,620
right to dial 911 or open that happens
we just a minute open

784
00:47:49,620 --> 00:47:52,580
so I wanted something that was really
easy to activate and that would have say

785
00:47:52,580 --> 00:47:53,470
a GPS

786
00:47:53,470 --> 00:47:57,940
and I mean ideally in line sci-fi future
vision something that kid like detect

787
00:47:57,940 --> 00:48:01,870
their proper levels of dopamine and
adrenaline to know when you're in a

788
00:48:01,870 --> 00:48:04,940
fear state and Miller your friends I'm
but thats

789
00:48:04,940 --> 00:48:09,280
far I guess a.m. but I have worked with
XP transmitters before in those

790
00:48:09,280 --> 00:48:10,360
performances

791
00:48:10,360 --> 00:48:15,490
and some the XP transmitters are like a
major part of this project so

792
00:48:15,490 --> 00:48:18,790
I wanna make these wearable electronic
devices and I'll show you some in them

793
00:48:18,790 --> 00:48:23,060
that are mesh networks so XP's have a
range if you get the right ones about to

794
00:48:23,060 --> 00:48:27,200
my own or I think there's new ones I
have a two and a half mile range

795
00:48:27,200 --> 00:48:30,820
and they also have a built-in mesh
networking capability so that means that

796
00:48:30,820 --> 00:48:31,550
each garment

797
00:48:31,550 --> 00:48:36,010
in that are making like their dresses or
bracelets or garter belt or whatever

798
00:48:36,010 --> 00:48:39,350
could transmit signal a two-mile buttons
intermission at work then

799
00:48:39,350 --> 00:48:43,190
any government that receiving a signal
good retransmit for another mile

800
00:48:43,190 --> 00:48:48,530
so from to the mat working with specific
I am working with specific group

801
00:48:48,530 --> 00:48:51,490
in group I was interested in from the
beginning are groups that are often

802
00:48:51,490 --> 00:48:53,290
subject to sexual violence like

803
00:48:53,290 --> 00:48:56,450
sex workers and women of color and so

804
00:48:56,450 --> 00:49:01,490
a.m. n dis group of artists activists in
bogota that I met in Columbia

805
00:49:01,490 --> 00:49:04,600
and so um

806
00:49:04,600 --> 00:49:07,320
when I started you know I made some
prototypes and then I started talking

807
00:49:07,320 --> 00:49:09,760
about it and showing and it designs

808
00:49:09,760 --> 00:49:13,200
and first both the sex or group and the
curb in Columbia

809
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:19,890
were like a.m. we don't really want to
send her GPS coordinates anywhere

810
00:49:19,890 --> 00:49:23,339
we who really want the government to
believe that any idea where we are so

811
00:49:23,340 --> 00:49:26,860
GPS is really freaking for them a.m.

812
00:49:26,860 --> 00:49:30,050
other okay so

813
00:49:30,050 --> 00:49:33,500
so that means I'm on my plan is to make
multiple types of these devices because

814
00:49:33,500 --> 00:49:35,330
some people are gonna wanna GPS

815
00:49:35,330 --> 00:49:38,930
right in some cases it would be better
for the cops to show up then for them

816
00:49:38,930 --> 00:49:39,700
not to show up

817
00:49:39,700 --> 00:49:42,790
even now cups are still prone to

818
00:49:42,790 --> 00:49:46,470
commit sexual violence after the show up
regardless we figured with the transfer

819
00:49:46,470 --> 00:49:48,830
immigrant or similarly that if someone
is dying

820
00:49:48,830 --> 00:49:52,470
have dehydration to probably still
better for the border patrol to show up

821
00:49:52,470 --> 00:49:54,210
in a

822
00:49:54,210 --> 00:49:58,630
in some cases in in all other cases no I
don't know but anyway so after talking

823
00:49:58,630 --> 00:50:00,480
to these two groups

824
00:50:00,480 --> 00:50:04,810
I decided to work on a harder problem
which and since there's a lot of big

825
00:50:04,810 --> 00:50:08,590
brainy hackers in the room maybe people
want to join me in collaborating on this

826
00:50:08,590 --> 00:50:09,420
project

827
00:50:09,420 --> 00:50:13,280
is to think about how we could make
locative

828
00:50:13,280 --> 00:50:16,830
mesh network garments that Oni have XP

829
00:50:16,830 --> 00:50:21,340
by me DX been a compass but not GPS

830
00:50:21,340 --> 00:50:25,530
am so it's something I've been train
figure out maybe could likes

831
00:50:25,530 --> 00:50:29,110
been in a circle like Wonder Woman and I
would determine which direction is one

832
00:50:29,110 --> 00:50:33,120
but probably not I don't know so that it
seems to me still like a heart problem

833
00:50:33,120 --> 00:50:36,560
and because XP's don't have directional
information they only have

834
00:50:36,560 --> 00:50:40,009
RSSI are billeted signal strength index

835
00:50:40,010 --> 00:50:44,060
which just tells you like very rough
approximation and how far

836
00:50:44,060 --> 00:50:48,700
other X these are

837
00:50:48,700 --> 00:50:53,830
so I'm so like I said I made some
prototypes for these things

838
00:50:53,830 --> 00:50:58,779
and what I've been doing so far is using
these prototypes for performances that

839
00:50:58,780 --> 00:50:59,400
would

840
00:50:59,400 --> 00:51:02,460
have bring to life all these different
issues that I'm thinking about this

841
00:51:02,460 --> 00:51:03,190
project

842
00:51:03,190 --> 00:51:08,430
local autonomy networks so and because I
imagine a lot a possible uses for these

843
00:51:08,430 --> 00:51:09,000
guns

844
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:12,460
right so I ever talked about me being a
butt sex workers once a collectively

845
00:51:12,460 --> 00:51:14,890
organized to protect each other from
violence

846
00:51:14,890 --> 00:51:19,470
or them you know good women transgender
insist gender agree to let each other

847
00:51:19,470 --> 00:51:22,280
know when they're walking home when they
arrive home safely

848
00:51:22,280 --> 00:51:26,430
um but maybe a group love bicyclists
wanna flock together for a group ride

849
00:51:26,430 --> 00:51:29,740
if you had a locative device that just
with the press of a button and Hannah

850
00:51:29,740 --> 00:51:33,160
LED indicator direction and that seems
use right

851
00:51:33,160 --> 00:51:37,100
on or maybe even protesters say
occupying banks right

852
00:51:37,100 --> 00:51:41,130
and because governments have shown from
Egypt to San Francisco that their

853
00:51:41,130 --> 00:51:44,560
perfectly willing to shut down cell
phone networks to prevent protests

854
00:51:44,560 --> 00:51:49,090
so as far as I'm concerned we can't rely
on corporations anymore to provide us

855
00:51:49,090 --> 00:51:52,560
our communications infrastructure and
I'm sure most people in the room

856
00:51:52,560 --> 00:51:55,670
agree with that probably like Nonna

857
00:51:55,670 --> 00:51:58,950
non non-white by Donna

858
00:51:58,950 --> 00:52:02,440
in Ewing non sequitur am

859
00:52:02,440 --> 00:52:05,810
but I mean I know I said to me
inspirations but that was another

860
00:52:05,810 --> 00:52:08,840
really early inspiration for this
project was

861
00:52:08,840 --> 00:52:14,230
and win the paraíba had their deep kind
of got cut off for the DNS level across

862
00:52:14,230 --> 00:52:15,540
the UK

863
00:52:15,540 --> 00:52:18,800
amore WikiLeaks getting shot for the
next level I mean I know there's like

864
00:52:18,800 --> 00:52:20,160
ways are at around it

865
00:52:20,160 --> 00:52:23,720
and but that those things to say to me
that as long as we're relying on the

866
00:52:23,720 --> 00:52:24,800
internet and their

867
00:52:24,800 --> 00:52:28,270
the conditions that are based in
corporations

868
00:52:28,270 --> 00:52:31,380
then were subject to the whims of
corporations so what I'm really

869
00:52:31,380 --> 00:52:34,520
interested in is lots of different mesh
networking technologies that are

870
00:52:34,520 --> 00:52:35,110
bottom-up

871
00:52:35,110 --> 00:52:39,430
and set it up down and don't lie and
telephone company infrastructure at all

872
00:52:39,430 --> 00:52:42,750
um and is another exciting related
project

873
00:52:42,750 --> 00:52:47,330
which is called that bat phone which
lets you mesh network

874
00:52:47,330 --> 00:52:51,170
with smartphones scenic mission at work
cell phone calls

875
00:52:51,170 --> 00:52:55,030
and then you can use the not just the
wifi but you can use the actual cell

876
00:52:55,030 --> 00:52:56,490
transmitter in your phone

877
00:52:56,490 --> 00:53:00,210
to make mention it worked cell phone
calls with the bat phone

878
00:53:00,210 --> 00:53:04,170
am but again ladies get some written
with cannot afford iPhones

879
00:53:04,170 --> 00:53:07,400
and even the group in but I was like
okay so

880
00:53:07,400 --> 00:53:10,600
your where electronic safety devices are

881
00:53:10,600 --> 00:53:13,650
60 bucks that's totally out of our price
range

882
00:53:13,650 --> 00:53:17,920
a.m. so I'm like working on raising
grants

883
00:53:17,920 --> 00:53:21,480
and doing fundraising to support the
project and to get these devices to

884
00:53:21,480 --> 00:53:23,100
people who need them

885
00:53:23,100 --> 00:53:26,220
a.m. so

886
00:53:26,220 --> 00:53:30,510
I he said I was working on performances
that are kinda raising these issues

887
00:53:30,510 --> 00:53:37,210
so I'm I do and just show a little
smidgen of this performance

888
00:53:37,210 --> 00:53:44,210
gym

889
00:54:01,109 --> 00:54:04,209
all things that however capital can't
are very

890
00:54:04,209 --> 00:54:11,209
rating heavy fire them

891
00:54:13,040 --> 00:54:17,009
how movies on each other hello

892
00:54:17,010 --> 00:54:22,400
to me on each other Los

893
00:54:22,400 --> 00:54:25,640
like homeless this message since

894
00:54:25,640 --> 00:54:29,910
and we'll see less show

895
00:54:29,910 --> 00:54:33,020
the house GA and more

896
00:54:33,020 --> 00:54:37,670
by sea creatures time shitting

897
00:54:37,670 --> 00:54:42,089
seeds mean the same and misleading and
my name

898
00:54:42,089 --> 00:54:45,859
Solis the land lease licence

899
00:54:45,859 --> 00:54:49,910
clueless mass

900
00:54:49,910 --> 00:54:53,098
holidays we have a long time
transparency

901
00:54:53,099 --> 00:54:56,579
as lol issued worried we belong here

902
00:54:56,579 --> 00:55:01,030
seems less mandolin disastrous

903
00:55:01,030 --> 00:55:04,460
so however missus as like this and

904
00:55:04,460 --> 00:55:11,460
it's easy

905
00:55:22,280 --> 00:55:24,360
how many things home

906
00:55:24,360 --> 00:55:27,750
in with violence hasn't seen the souls

907
00:55:27,750 --> 00:55:32,810
silence ups yes what happens in our

908
00:55:32,810 --> 00:55:36,390
this bases human race are there

909
00:55:36,390 --> 00:55:40,830
I'll various communication networks
response

910
00:55:40,830 --> 00:55:46,060
and not us KK minus can be seen largess

911
00:55:46,060 --> 00:55:52,940
worrisome the linkages how these are the
ones that was silence reaction with us

912
00:55:52,940 --> 00:55:57,090
present smiles love and the last night

913

00:56:32,460 --> 00:56:33,870
so

921
00:56:33,870 --> 00:56:38,270
so performances use poetry movement to
can invoke the issues in

922
00:56:38,270 --> 00:56:42,200
and in this project adding pressure is
an important technology that I'm trying

923
00:56:42,200 --> 00:56:47,990
to work on

924
00:56:47,990 --> 00:56:51,519
and what else okay so and in those

925
00:56:51,519 --> 00:56:56,440
'em in a performance they started with
these projects are based on your wire

926
00:56:56,440 --> 00:57:00,250
electroluminescent wire as you can see
but

927
00:57:00,250 --> 00:57:03,869
Anna the hours not really good for
wearables

928
00:57:03,869 --> 00:57:09,349
and so that is a.m. vers and ends around
to protect I'm not going back to you

929
00:57:09,349 --> 00:57:14,880
and because most wearable electronics
use this thread that it has

930
00:57:14,880 --> 00:57:18,309
conductive materials woven into it like
silver trent

931
00:57:18,309 --> 00:57:21,680
but he a liar relies on circuit boards

932
00:57:21,680 --> 00:57:25,039
and DC-ten easy conversion with big

933
00:57:25,039 --> 00:57:28,289
battery packs and wires that break so

934
00:57:28,289 --> 00:57:32,859
am that I don't you didn't work exactly
as I hoped in their performance

935
00:57:32,859 --> 00:57:37,730
cuz wanting to make something that's
like on a table and moves around its

936
00:57:37,730 --> 00:57:40,569
nothing to rehearse with dancers for
three days and have them

937
00:57:40,569 --> 00:57:44,319
be jumping up and down like is it okay
if we like falling

938
00:57:44,319 --> 00:57:47,619
Graham each other in gym and then anyway
whenever

939
00:57:47,619 --> 00:57:52,119
not only in so much less ministering you
can do when good

940
00:57:52,119 --> 00:57:56,579
so no worry a wire so future versions or
later versions would use him

941
00:57:56,579 --> 00:58:01,109
are just using LED's am because
religious for directional indicator we

942
00:58:01,109 --> 00:58:02,348
don't need to be aware

943
00:58:02,349 --> 00:58:05,710
although I mean a as I've been doing
I've been thinking about a lot of

944
00:58:05,710 --> 00:58:07,730
different possibilities for this project
because

945
00:58:07,730 --> 00:58:11,200
I mean the ideas now it's like
communicate with your friends and that

946
00:58:11,200 --> 00:58:12,480
you might be in like a

947
00:58:12,480 --> 00:58:16,339
close situation right like a group sex
workers working within a few blocks are

948
00:58:16,339 --> 00:58:20,328
are close enough to come help each other
or like a group of people going out to a

949
00:58:20,329 --> 00:58:20,769
club

950
00:58:20,769 --> 00:58:25,089
or people who live close to each other
you know could use these devices a.m.

951
00:58:25,089 --> 00:58:30,210
but I'm printer

952
00:58:30,210 --> 00:58:33,420
and that I'm ok

953
00:58:33,420 --> 00:58:36,859
yeah Terry jet lag

954
00:58:36,859 --> 00:58:39,980
yeah okay moving on so

955
00:58:39,980 --> 00:58:43,970
here some not very exciting code that's
from those protect

956
00:58:43,970 --> 00:58:47,539
am so use this tutorial from builder dot
com

957
00:58:47,539 --> 00:58:51,829
to do that you know where code and

958
00:58:51,829 --> 00:58:55,559
the important thing about this protects
was getting the RSSI information and

959
00:58:55,559 --> 00:58:56,650
have the expertise

960
00:58:56,650 --> 00:58:59,930
and I'm using using these

961
00:58:59,930 --> 00:59:03,500
DL sequencer boards from spark fun which
sock

962
00:59:03,500 --> 00:59:06,589
and broke over and over and over again I
would like five

963
00:59:06,589 --> 00:59:09,769
and then like to with them worked and
I'm not that bad at soldering

964
00:59:09,769 --> 00:59:12,890
faxing hope am so

965
00:59:12,890 --> 00:59:16,109
the %ah sequencer Department oh yeah but
so I use this

966
00:59:16,109 --> 00:59:20,119
are as a side to get ours as they are
you have to use polls in in PWM

967
00:59:20,119 --> 00:59:23,720
but and neck surgeons other protecting
remaking

968
00:59:23,720 --> 00:59:28,410
will use the XB API because the FBI has
built in Mission it working functions

969
00:59:28,410 --> 00:59:31,609
seeing create a packet and send it to
address 0

970
00:59:31,609 --> 00:59:35,450
and it will broadcast to all the
comments and also does all the network

971
00:59:35,450 --> 00:59:36,660
negotiation between

972
00:59:36,660 --> 00:59:42,220
and the router nodes and importance from

973
00:59:42,220 --> 00:59:46,900
anderson's red hope and you prolly wanna
see code here's the other good to it has

974
00:59:46,900 --> 00:59:48,890
been a code that has the ear wire
feeding

975
00:59:48,890 --> 00:59:52,348
also not very exciting but EL doesn't
fade

976
00:59:52,349 --> 00:59:56,140
so the only way you can do it is to
simulate feeding buying making like

977
00:59:56,140 --> 01:00:02,160
very brief pulses that get longer and
shorter am

978
01:00:02,160 --> 01:00:05,368
but to make his government's I mean
something is really difficult about

979
01:00:05,369 --> 01:00:06,400
wearable electronics

980
01:00:06,400 --> 01:00:09,869
is that's connective thread is not
shielded

981
01:00:09,869 --> 01:00:14,190
light wire is right away as a rat and
rabbit but conductive thread is not so

982
01:00:14,190 --> 01:00:18,289
and you have to so these garments in
such a way that the threads never touch

983
01:00:18,289 --> 01:00:22,619
or never cross right I'm so usually when
I'm making wanted them

984
01:00:22,619 --> 01:00:26,430
a really don't add rock but I do really
bad

985
01:00:26,430 --> 01:00:30,240
fashion sketches like this one and try
to figure out where to put the wires

986
01:00:30,240 --> 01:00:33,460
am and is a pretty consuming hand

987
01:00:33,460 --> 01:00:37,119
hand process of selling cuz he cant
since both ends have to be wrapped

988
01:00:37,119 --> 01:00:39,220
around the circuit boards then

989
01:00:39,220 --> 01:00:42,500
you can't really use a sewing machine as
you know I know how to use one

990
01:00:42,500 --> 01:00:45,690
year

991
01:00:45,690 --> 01:00:48,839
I

992
01:00:48,839 --> 01:00:52,750
you yeah is the little better doing I'm

993
01:00:52,750 --> 01:00:56,660
a.m. but also after making a sketch and
making the city with her

994
01:00:56,660 --> 01:00:59,670
the lily pad on the on the sleeve but
decided that was stupid and

995
01:00:59,670 --> 01:01:04,319
put it in a better place because it's so
hard to get 20 connections sewn in this

996
01:01:04,319 --> 01:01:05,799
tiny little sleeve fabric

997
01:01:05,799 --> 01:01:09,549
and you have to think that a lot making
web electron acceptor like plan where

998
01:01:09,549 --> 01:01:10,599
the Suns gonna go

999
01:01:10,599 --> 01:01:14,119
um and also since I'm doing is like
feeding pulsing

1000
01:01:14,119 --> 01:01:18,950
governments then I'm you don't use the
PWM pins which I have why have them

1001
01:01:18,950 --> 01:01:20,309
labels and M

1002
01:01:20,309 --> 01:01:23,410
so there's only six pins available to do
PWM

1003
01:01:23,410 --> 01:01:27,190
which is poss with modulation which you
can ask about if you're in

1004
01:01:27,190 --> 01:01:31,519
am okay so only couple minutes wrapping
up

1005
01:01:31,519 --> 01:01:35,910
me arm the one we doing out so last week
two weeks ago

1006
01:01:35,910 --> 01:01:39,348
I did this opening night performance at
the ally media conference I'm gonna love

1007
01:01:39,349 --> 01:01:41,049
them you comfort you have to go

1008
01:01:41,049 --> 01:01:46,329
to me with it I am and it worked with
three dancers who were from Philly

1009
01:01:46,329 --> 01:01:49,239
who for those garments and I read that
poem so we did a similar version and

1010
01:01:49,239 --> 01:01:50,920
their performances are

1011
01:01:50,920 --> 01:01:54,579
am but was really fantastic about allied
many conferences that they're not just

1012
01:01:54,579 --> 01:01:58,099
like talking and thinking about politics
and technology but like working on the

1013
01:01:58,099 --> 01:01:59,680
ground with people who need it

1014
01:01:59,680 --> 01:02:03,690
so after ending their performance 3
queer youth have color group came up to

1015
01:02:03,690 --> 01:02:04,230
me

1016
01:02:04,230 --> 01:02:07,670
there is a listener and I'm your
projects and

1017
01:02:07,670 --> 01:02:10,880
strong beautiful which is a young
women's group when they came up in there

1018
01:02:10,880 --> 01:02:11,190
like

1019
01:02:11,190 --> 01:02:14,359
we wanna get your devices to our kids to
our youth

1020
01:02:14,359 --> 01:02:18,058
to our people we work with so

1021
01:02:18,059 --> 01:02:21,369
that's what I'm doing next is working
with these youth group in Detroit

1022
01:02:21,369 --> 01:02:24,759
to actually make these devices and get
them working well enough to actually

1023
01:02:24,759 --> 01:02:27,150
help somebody and then get them in their
hands

1024
01:02:27,150 --> 01:02:30,489
but also along the way and it seems to
me like

1025
01:02:30,489 --> 01:02:34,720
even if it is only worked perfectly it
doesn't its it's not as important as the

1026
01:02:34,720 --> 01:02:37,650
Humane agreement as to what to do when
someone presses the button

1027
01:02:37,650 --> 01:02:40,210
because I'm really interested in prison
abolitionist strategies in

1028
01:02:40,210 --> 01:02:42,480
community-based response to violence

1029
01:02:42,480 --> 01:02:47,319
and because as a trans woman a color I
know that comes in on it was my friend

1030
01:02:47,319 --> 01:02:49,839
Alana manana cases the Cubs are gonna do

1031
01:02:49,839 --> 01:02:53,808
bad worse things to me when they show up
so am also not interested in putting

1032
01:02:53,809 --> 01:02:55,769
people in cages

1033
01:02:55,769 --> 01:02:59,369
but I know that we're talking about
sexual violence nobody agrees

1034
01:02:59,369 --> 01:03:02,829
and it's like a lot there's a lot to
think about and discuss their so

1035
01:03:02,829 --> 01:03:07,049
and planning you know all these these
projects to be really long term

1036
01:03:07,049 --> 01:03:08,989
relationships where we do

1037
01:03:08,989 --> 01:03:12,299
model days and workshops and discussions
have agreements about

1038
01:03:12,299 --> 01:03:15,769
what to do when somebody presses the
button and that means like trust

1039
01:03:15,769 --> 01:03:20,450
building relationship building and all
those things

1040
01:03:20,450 --> 01:03:23,480
I'm one other thing I'm working on is
this

1041
01:03:23,480 --> 01:03:28,539
design fiction sci-fi movie using these
garments and kinda speculating about how

1042
01:03:28,539 --> 01:03:32,400
fantastically maybe in the future I'm
which will hopefully be in the mix

1043
01:03:32,400 --> 01:03:35,559
Film Festival in New York which you can
see them

1044
01:03:35,559 --> 01:03:40,690
and and like I said continuing to do
these workshops

1045
01:03:40,690 --> 01:03:44,299
and I'm so no I'm done a few with them
in am

1046
01:03:44,299 --> 01:03:47,559
their side and Detroit resides like

1047
01:03:47,559 --> 01:03:51,109
at near Los Angeles I'm and so

1048
01:03:51,109 --> 01:03:54,920
from if you want to help in club rate
we're working with Lance a very specific

1049
01:03:54,920 --> 01:03:56,369
people so there's a

1050
01:03:56,369 --> 01:03:59,869
queer youth color visibility project in
Riverside

1051
01:03:59,869 --> 01:04:03,730
and there's a sex worker rights group
called maggie's in Toronto that were

1052
01:04:03,730 --> 01:04:08,599
working with I'm who it was amazing to
talk to Maggies in Toronto cuz they were

1053
01:04:08,599 --> 01:04:09,489
like

1054
01:04:09,489 --> 01:04:13,650
you know even the most basic Skillshare
for sex worker we don't do them

1055
01:04:13,650 --> 01:04:17,230
like most sex workers should have a safe
call like somebody to call

1056
01:04:17,230 --> 01:04:21,380
if you need help and like we never do
you skill shares about having a safe

1057
01:04:21,380 --> 01:04:21,960
call

1058
01:04:21,960 --> 01:04:26,470
or much less about like what to do when
you go with the prisons what to do when

1059
01:04:26,470 --> 01:04:27,700
you comin

1060
01:04:27,700 --> 01:04:30,829
and so they're really excited about
kinda using the technology in the

1061
01:04:30,829 --> 01:04:33,609
project just even as a way to start
conversations

1062
01:04:33,609 --> 01:04:36,640
and has been my experience that working
on this project for year is there

1063
01:04:36,640 --> 01:04:39,980
it's hard to talk about sexual violence
engendered and racialized violence and

1064
01:04:39,980 --> 01:04:41,650
let people don't want to talk about it

1065
01:04:41,650 --> 01:04:45,660
and so actually about six months into it
I was pretty much gave a

1066
01:04:45,660 --> 01:04:49,180
I was like I was gonna but these are two
windows in a box

1067
01:04:49,180 --> 01:04:52,349
and call that documentation be done

1068
01:04:52,349 --> 01:04:56,200
because I'm tired of being the one that
has to like raise the difficult issue

1069
01:04:56,200 --> 01:04:59,210
but going to Alameda conference change
that

1070
01:04:59,210 --> 01:05:02,489
actually like meeting people who are
like we we need these

1071
01:05:02,489 --> 01:05:05,769
now was really fantastic I'm

1072
01:05:05,769 --> 01:05:09,220
or talking to you this sex worker rights
group who was like you know

1073
01:05:09,220 --> 01:05:13,289
exactly what exactly when a sex worker
needs is like record like a way to pull

1074
01:05:13,289 --> 01:05:13,700
them

1075
01:05:13,700 --> 01:05:16,559
waited the way to tell their friends
that they need help that doesn't look

1076
01:05:16,559 --> 01:05:18,039
like a cell phone

1077
01:05:18,039 --> 01:05:21,239
that not gonna like out Ms calling
summoning

1078
01:05:21,239 --> 01:05:24,450
am so just to wrap up

1079
01:05:24,450 --> 01:05:27,489
which have pictures worship feedback

1080
01:05:27,489 --> 01:05:31,140
I'm one thing I was really into me using
an interesting was in Riverside

1081
01:05:31,140 --> 01:05:34,029
part in the discussion was like what
kinds of violence that we face and have

1082
01:05:34,029 --> 01:05:35,880
the res technology to respond

1083
01:05:35,880 --> 01:05:39,339
and it did surprise me what these you

1084
01:05:39,339 --> 01:05:42,450
kids people were saying like psychic
violence

1085
01:05:42,450 --> 01:05:46,890
or just images on TV being violent I'm
or gender policing all these different

1086
01:05:46,890 --> 01:05:48,410
forms of violence and I was like

1087
01:05:48,410 --> 01:05:51,640
well there's a lot of work to do

1088
01:05:51,640 --> 01:05:54,950
but wrapping up this brings me back to
my mom

1089
01:05:54,950 --> 01:05:58,890
and because like I said in the beginning
with this project for me comes out it is

1090
01:05:58,890 --> 01:06:02,400
this strategy that have been using my
artwork is to take experiences

1091
01:06:02,400 --> 01:06:05,239
oppression and violence and have turned
into

1092
01:06:05,239 --> 01:06:08,349
motivation and turn them into

1093
01:06:08,349 --> 01:06:11,670
knowledge Billy and use them as a basis
for

1094
01:06:11,670 --> 01:06:15,319
ways of thinking and

1095
01:06:15,319 --> 01:06:19,819
so I think that as our bodies continue
to be transformed by technology

1096
01:06:19,819 --> 01:06:24,038
my work urges us to consider the social
marginalization at people based on the

1097
01:06:24,039 --> 01:06:26,230
categorization and their bodies

1098
01:06:26,230 --> 01:06:29,890
in order not to replicate these patterns
but to mention new possibilities for

1099
01:06:29,890 --> 01:06:31,980
human freedom and autonomy

1100
01:06:31,980 --> 01:06:35,520
based on technology be somebody
extension technologies

1101
01:06:35,520 --> 01:06:38,680
and religious to say that if we wanna
learn about augmenting our bodies and

1102
01:06:38,680 --> 01:06:41,270
going beyond our bodies we should learn
from

1103
01:06:41,270 --> 01:06:44,730
transgender people like me who were
their bodies permanently biologically

1104
01:06:44,730 --> 01:06:46,200
modified already

1105
01:06:46,200 --> 01:06:50,759
or differently abled people who live
with technological extensions every

1106
01:06:50,759 --> 01:06:53,569
single day in the life and have an
intimate relationship with them

1107
01:06:53,569 --> 01:06:57,279
or people who are mentally-ill so-called
who have a totally different cognitive

1108
01:06:57,279 --> 01:06:58,509
experience in the world

1109
01:06:58,509 --> 01:07:02,099
right like people in schizophrenia
autism so that was we're making new

1110
01:07:02,099 --> 01:07:03,779
technologies we don't extend

1111
01:07:03,779 --> 01:07:07,969
and worsen social inequality but instead
work towards a world where people who

1112
01:07:07,969 --> 01:07:09,270
are marginalized today

1113
01:07:09,270 --> 01:07:12,520
could instead be valued NBC

1114
01:07:12,520 --> 01:07:19,520
thank you %ah

1115
01:07:28,480 --> 01:07:33,239
so I'm hi I it's weird not to be able to
see you guys which is

1116
01:07:33,239 --> 01:07:36,969
on something I'm not used to and my name
is Kayden

1117
01:07:36,969 --> 01:07:40,039
I am I have slides

1118
01:07:40,039 --> 01:07:43,839
ir good there somewhere

1119
01:07:43,839 --> 01:07:47,339
on excellent a so be

1120
01:07:47,339 --> 01:07:50,750
thing that I wanna talk about is
actually funny that I had to make a ring

1121
01:07:50,750 --> 01:07:51,369
that this issue

1122
01:07:51,369 --> 01:07:55,259
like hangs technology right that on

1123
01:07:55,259 --> 01:08:00,640
thumbs up on having this technology that
a

1124
01:08:00,640 --> 01:08:04,029
eventually what would it really does for
people is start conversations

1125
01:08:04,029 --> 01:08:07,900
on and I started I'm a graduate program
at Buffalo thinking like I'm gonna build

1126
01:08:07,900 --> 01:08:08,520
is awesome

1127
01:08:08,520 --> 01:08:11,599
alternate reality games use this week
technology do all the stuff

1128
01:08:11,599 --> 01:08:15,700
the vendor discovered is that thing that
AM Best at and be that we need the most

1129
01:08:15,700 --> 01:08:18,770
it actually just have conversations arm

1130
01:08:18,770 --> 01:08:21,870
because we're not having a lot I really
important conversations and

1131
01:08:21,870 --> 01:08:25,599
I'm gonna quickly run through a couple
other games that I think are doing it

1132
01:08:25,599 --> 01:08:26,710
wrong

1133
01:08:26,710 --> 01:08:31,029
arm and then show you a game that is is
on the road to doing it right

1134
01:08:31,029 --> 01:08:34,989
on and I have to express privilege have
I'm working on

1135
01:08:34,989 --> 01:08:39,020
the next project is where the series a
project that started with this first

1136
01:08:39,020 --> 01:08:41,150
game that that cannot 2007

1137
01:08:41,149 --> 01:08:44,330
on as an education researcher on

1138
01:08:44,330 --> 01:08:47,729
some pretty psyched about that the
slides I have some links in them and

1139
01:08:47,730 --> 01:08:48,359
they will be up

1140
01:08:48,359 --> 01:08:52,489
on my website body without that word

1141
01:08:52,489 --> 01:08:56,630
are so water alternate reality games
I'll be really gains

1142
01:08:56,630 --> 01:08:59,830
take the substance everyday life and
even into narratives that

1143
01:08:59,830 --> 01:09:03,158
layer additional meaning that
interaction upon the real world

1144
01:09:03,158 --> 01:09:06,198
arm when I put my first alternate
reality game I

1145
01:09:06,199 --> 01:09:10,480
with my mind was blown on at the commute
was formed around this league

1146
01:09:10,480 --> 01:09:14,080
set like really strangely cryptographic
like mysteries

1147
01:09:14,080 --> 01:09:17,778
in like on middle-of-the-night cell
phone calls and just like general

1148
01:09:17,779 --> 01:09:19,250
ridiculous shit

1149
01:09:19,250 --> 01:09:22,979
on and I immediately saw our connection

1150
01:09:22,980 --> 01:09:28,500
right between this sort is II really
diverse you serve like many

1151
01:09:28,500 --> 01:09:31,710
certain moods and technology and on

1152
01:09:31,710 --> 01:09:34,799
things those interested in in as a
social justice educator

1153
01:09:34,799 --> 01:09:38,130
on be first

1154
01:09:38,130 --> 01:09:42,199
ordinarily games were largely Lake big
studio productions that we like really

1155
01:09:42,199 --> 01:09:43,290
high budget

1156
01:09:43,290 --> 01:09:46,929
on their produced for on my as ad
campaigns

1157
01:09:46,929 --> 01:09:50,000
for the hollywood movies stuff like that
livings also

1158
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:54,330
interests me about you really games is
since that time to the 2001 oh so the

1159
01:09:54,330 --> 01:09:55,800
first like

1160
01:09:55,800 --> 01:09:59,330
well-known alternate reality game on

1161
01:09:59,330 --> 01:10:03,940
more artists independent producers who
are doing it just because they love to

1162
01:10:03,940 --> 01:10:04,650
do it

1163
01:10:04,650 --> 01:10:08,429
on educators have been using this medium
to do different stuff

1164
01:10:08,429 --> 01:10:12,800
arm so as opposed to like something bean
produced by community and then

1165
01:10:12,800 --> 01:10:16,030
Reaper pre-debate capital something the
capital came up with in the community

1166
01:10:16,030 --> 01:10:16,540
was like

1167
01:10:16,540 --> 01:10:19,639
you know what but this this is ours on I
think that's really a big

1168
01:10:19,639 --> 01:10:23,010
awesome I am so

1169
01:10:23,010 --> 01:10:26,989
be at I'm interested in in thinking
about alternate reality games outside

1170
01:10:26,989 --> 01:10:30,389
a this big studio framework on and

1171
01:10:30,389 --> 01:10:33,610
I don't know alive you prolly are
familiar Jim condos book

1172
01:10:33,610 --> 01:10:37,219
I reality is broken: on which
unfortunately I can't tell you about all

1173
01:10:37,219 --> 01:10:39,060
the things I find problematic about it

1174
01:10:39,060 --> 01:10:43,090
on but I think one other know the things
she does

1175
01:10:43,090 --> 01:10:46,880
that is useful for us on as people were
interested

1176
01:10:46,880 --> 01:10:52,489
in a looking at these technologies in
creating alternate realities that are

1177
01:10:52,489 --> 01:10:55,960
on the teach people things that are
valuable in terms of

1178
01:10:55,960 --> 01:10:59,960
liberating themselves is she opens up
the definition of the alternate reality

1179
01:10:59,960 --> 01:11:00,400
game

1180
01:11:00,400 --> 01:11:04,000
right so so one other examples in the
book is this game chore worse

1181
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:08,530
by Kevin Davis on and chores is actually
it's really who areas because it's

1182
01:11:08,530 --> 01:11:09,070
eighty

1183
01:11:09,070 --> 01:11:12,219
are massively multiplayer online
role-playing game about cleaning your

1184
01:11:12,219 --> 01:11:13,489
house

1185
01:11:13,489 --> 01:11:16,989
iron riskier is really funny I'll and

1186
01:11:16,989 --> 01:11:20,650
for some people especially a I don't
know the folks at you have kids who like

1187
01:11:20,650 --> 01:11:24,480
market doing chores highly recommended
I'll

1188
01:11:24,480 --> 01:11:28,340
me the issue you are experiencing gold
for doing chores around the house

1189
01:11:28,340 --> 01:11:32,670
and they're all sort of like a re framed
as these like epic adventures

1190
01:11:32,670 --> 01:11:36,659
I am and its own unit or chores is kinda
hilarious

1191
01:11:36,659 --> 01:11:39,920
it away is no he really give it creates
this additional layer

1192
01:11:39,920 --> 01:11:44,800
me meaning on top of the regular world
on it's also kinda simplistic right like

1193
01:11:44,800 --> 01:11:47,840
a measuring our experience points in our

1194
01:11:47,840 --> 01:11:51,250
are gold collected is is well and good
but on

1195
01:11:51,250 --> 01:11:54,679
I'm actually interested in things that
get away from this like certain

1196
01:11:54,679 --> 01:11:58,070
brute kwan vacationers a bar are like

1197
01:11:58,070 --> 01:12:01,540
daily lives interactions good I think
that's dangerous right I think that

1198
01:12:01,540 --> 01:12:04,920
you know and that's one of the things
that on

1199
01:12:04,920 --> 01:12:08,770
the kinda radical education paradigm
that I'm interested in is trying to rail

1200
01:12:08,770 --> 01:12:09,630
against

1201
01:12:09,630 --> 01:12:13,900
on because in our school systems we see
a lot

1202
01:12:13,900 --> 01:12:17,630
this motion toward on make extreme

1203
01:12:17,630 --> 01:12:21,219
quantification only quantification
things on

1204
01:12:21,219 --> 01:12:24,380
in the form high-stakes testing on and
things like that

1205
01:12:24,380 --> 01:12:29,090
on literally dark to me dislike tendency
toward quantification is a

1206
01:12:29,090 --> 01:12:33,000
as opposed to qualitative analysis I am

1207
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:36,849
the other issue is I think that you know
tour was kind of awesome good makes this

1208
01:12:36,849 --> 01:12:41,620
everything that we can't really escape
on hilarious and fun and makes is on

1209
01:12:41,620 --> 01:12:41,889
point

1210
01:12:41,889 --> 01:12:45,580
the seller unpleasant tasks like much
more enjoyable on

1211
01:12:45,580 --> 01:12:49,110
but that they're the reason it makes it
more enjoyable is because

1212
01:12:49,110 --> 01:12:52,799
incentive making your chores these
things you have to do by yourself

1213
01:12:52,800 --> 01:12:56,060
they make it like this collaborative
adventure other people live with you

1214
01:12:56,060 --> 01:12:59,820
arms it's really about the attraction
it's not about our died game

1215
01:12:59,820 --> 01:13:03,380
right it's about making it a mutual
collaborative thing as opposed to mom

1216
01:13:03,380 --> 01:13:05,679
coming down hard for not making a bet

1217
01:13:05,679 --> 01:13:10,270
I am I'm also interested in I guess

1218
01:13:10,270 --> 01:13:13,260
what if the difficult and unpleasant
tasks are a little bit more complicated

1219
01:13:13,260 --> 01:13:14,900
the cleanup batter

1220
01:13:14,900 --> 01:13:18,270
what if they are about wrecking races

1221
01:13:18,270 --> 01:13:21,679
thats really like complicated and

1222
01:13:21,679 --> 01:13:24,800
many people unpleasant task and we don't
know like

1223
01:13:24,800 --> 01:13:28,130
in my classroom at the University at
Buffalo where we talk about race in

1224
01:13:28,130 --> 01:13:29,239
video games

1225
01:13:29,239 --> 01:13:32,340
she gets real awkward real fast people
don't want to talk

1226
01:13:32,340 --> 01:13:35,639
on and students who were like really
forthcoming at first

1227
01:13:35,639 --> 01:13:38,670
become very reticent I M

1228
01:13:38,670 --> 01:13:42,920
think that's because it's got five
minutes ago arm

1229
01:13:42,920 --> 01:13:46,440
so really badly I wanna look at this
game on some me know it it's called

1230
01:13:46,440 --> 01:13:47,670
third world farmer

1231
01:13:47,670 --> 01:13:51,320
on and it's like super problematic okay
I am

1232
01:13:51,320 --> 01:13:54,389
what are the issues with the game the
biggest issue with the game

1233
01:13:54,389 --> 01:13:57,790
is that it's so the strategy resource
management single player game

1234
01:13:57,790 --> 01:14:01,309
where on you play a

1235
01:14:01,309 --> 01:14:04,590
a family of farmers in over there

1236
01:14:04,590 --> 01:14:08,030
in Africa they don't say where right on
actually

1237
01:14:08,030 --> 01:14:12,259
what the game does it randomize is the
sort of like terrible things an awesome

1238
01:14:12,260 --> 01:14:13,570
things that can happen to you

1239
01:14:13,570 --> 01:14:16,940
it completely removes any kind of
structural critique about why there is

1240
01:14:16,940 --> 01:14:17,730
poverty

1241
01:14:17,730 --> 01:14:20,969
in the world from the experience of
playing the game

1242
01:14:20,969 --> 01:14:24,739
in addition it is really like really
unbalanced frustrating

1243
01:14:24,739 --> 01:14:28,469
terrible your face arm when

1244
01:14:28,469 --> 01:14:31,910
but but a new structural critique issue
is important to me

1245
01:14:31,910 --> 01:14:36,510
because I think that were things that I
resort management games can do

1246
01:14:36,510 --> 01:14:40,320
is bring a structural critique into the
game arm and actually avoids doing that

1247
01:14:40,320 --> 01:14:40,840
missed

1248
01:14:40,840 --> 01:14:43,960
I mean this is an early attempt on by
student

1249
01:14:43,960 --> 01:14:47,550
to to create a game those about raising
awareness about poverty in the

1250
01:14:47,550 --> 01:14:48,340
developing world

1251
01:14:48,340 --> 01:14:51,500
okay so you know this is this is a step
in a direction

1252
01:14:51,500 --> 01:14:55,340
about educating people about social
justice

1253
01:14:55,340 --> 01:14:59,679
um but one other for me one other
fundamental issues

1254
01:14:59,679 --> 01:15:03,559
I here is that these are really complex

1255
01:15:03,559 --> 01:15:06,559
at the Greek scale social issues right

1256
01:15:06,559 --> 01:15:10,580
arm and it's hard to say what

1257
01:15:10,580 --> 01:15:13,820
exactly I guess a

1258
01:15:13,820 --> 01:15:17,910
I me I don't think the lobby who develop
these games no action want people to do

1259
01:15:17,910 --> 01:15:21,800
seriously because there a farmer points
you to a whole bunch of nonprofits and

1260
01:15:21,800 --> 01:15:23,660
NGOs only give money

1261
01:15:23,660 --> 01:15:26,670
it's like well what does money do right
monies is part iv:

1262
01:15:26,670 --> 01:15:30,449
this system like colonialism in
capitalism they created the conditions a

1263
01:15:30,449 --> 01:15:31,550
pop in the first place

1264
01:15:31,550 --> 01:15:35,660
really complicated arm so this
researcher at the gambit game lab

1265
01:15:35,660 --> 01:15:39,800
MIT cousin mitnick goods says and that
serious games

1266
01:15:39,800 --> 01:15:43,370
games for change whatever are they claim
to raise awareness about

1267
01:15:43,370 --> 01:15:46,559
social political issues like in equity
and justice

1268
01:15:46,559 --> 01:15:50,239
and what-have-you but they don't even
know the terms on which the measuring

1269
01:15:50,239 --> 01:15:51,559
the effectiveness

1270
01:15:51,559 --> 01:15:54,809
so there's no way we can tell how
effective they are in doing the thing

1271
01:15:54,809 --> 01:15:56,120
that they're trying to do

1272
01:15:56,120 --> 01:15:59,610
which is really perplexing right like
arm if I'm

1273
01:15:59,610 --> 01:16:03,500
spending all this time and energy making
this game about like trying to educate

1274
01:16:03,500 --> 01:16:04,440
people about

1275
01:16:04,440 --> 01:16:08,949
I don't know like the genocide in Darfur
something I would like to know

1276
01:16:08,949 --> 01:16:12,059
at least for me how the game would be
affected

1277
01:16:12,059 --> 01:16:16,190
I am the good news is in terms of these
big complex problems

1278
01:16:16,190 --> 01:16:19,469
that a are hard to simulate hard to
serve unpack

1279
01:16:19,469 --> 01:16:24,360
on medical educators been thinking about
this for like over a century

1280
01:16:24,360 --> 01:16:27,530
so what they're frameworks that are I
think a really useful

1281
01:16:27,530 --> 01:16:31,290
I in terms of looking forward from the
sort a paradigm

1282
01:16:31,290 --> 01:16:35,280
like let's make a game delayed raise
awareness on I think awareness is really

1283
01:16:35,280 --> 01:16:36,019
vague in

1284
01:16:36,020 --> 01:16:42,489
on I'm not comfortable with that
vagueness

1285
01:16:42,489 --> 01:16:46,320
so critical pedagogy on is is being
weird but now I'm proposing

1286
01:16:46,320 --> 01:16:49,799
as we just think about how we build
alternate realities

1287
01:16:49,800 --> 01:16:53,150
on as anything about these games

1288
01:16:53,150 --> 01:16:57,480
not as training and not as content
delivery brothers facilitators

1289
01:16:57,480 --> 01:17:01,080
he's kinda difficult conversations we
need to have on

1290
01:17:01,080 --> 01:17:04,730
so crippling pedagogy and according to
henry who ru

1291
01:17:04,730 --> 01:17:09,219
is great I'll is education movement
guided by passion in principle to help

1292
01:17:09,219 --> 01:17:11,300
students develop consciousness and
freedom

1293
01:17:11,300 --> 01:17:15,349
I recognize that North Korean tendencies
and connect knowledge to power and the

1294
01:17:15,349 --> 01:17:17,469
ability to take constructive action

1295
01:17:17,469 --> 01:17:21,239
right says about being empowering people
to serve critique their own situation

1296
01:17:21,239 --> 01:17:22,900
and then do something about it

1297
01:17:22,900 --> 01:17:26,290
on in my opinion giving money to NGO is
well and good

1298
01:17:26,290 --> 01:17:29,900
was not necessary doing something about
the fundamental issue right

1299
01:17:29,900 --> 01:17:35,830
arm so and my sort of personal
background in critical pedagogy

1300
01:17:35,830 --> 01:17:39,150
companies program at University Michigan
read an undergraduate degree

1301
01:17:39,150 --> 01:17:42,219
arm called the program I intergroup
dialogue

1302
01:17:42,219 --> 01:17:46,790
on and dialogue is designed to Sir
create the speech situations is

1303
01:17:46,790 --> 01:17:51,130
situations for conversation and allow
people to communicate across differences

1304
01:17:51,130 --> 01:17:54,260
to reshape prevailing power relations

1305
01:17:54,260 --> 01:17:58,260
so by through the active communicating
with each other through the active

1306
01:17:58,260 --> 01:18:00,110
actually sitting down at a table

1307
01:18:00,110 --> 01:18:03,179
and having like face to face discussions
about things

1308
01:18:03,179 --> 01:18:07,320
how can we change the way that powered
keep us apart

1309
01:18:07,320 --> 01:18:10,780
on which sounds really touchy feely

1310
01:18:10,780 --> 01:18:15,090
right but is actually incredibly
effective I am

1311
01:18:15,090 --> 01:18:18,790
so the games I want to point to as a
sort of an example %uh

1312
01:18:18,790 --> 01:18:22,059
the right direction in which to move on
is

1313
01:18:22,059 --> 01:18:26,380
a actually not to be again all I if the
game is played on what does play online

1314
01:18:26,380 --> 01:18:27,530
called world without oil

1315
01:18:27,530 --> 01:18:32,099
on his game but people crisis players
were asked to

1316
01:18:32,099 --> 01:18:36,469
role play themselves on in this
periodical future were suddenly oil

1317
01:18:36,469 --> 01:18:39,480
prices spiked in availability declined

1318
01:18:39,480 --> 01:18:42,580
home and was really interesting about
the game

1319
01:18:42,580 --> 01:18:47,059
is it put players II in touch with
people both in the regional networks

1320
01:18:47,059 --> 01:18:50,469
who then communicate together about what
might happen

1321
01:18:50,469 --> 01:18:53,730
in their geographical region at the time
I was living in Michigan is this is like

1322
01:18:53,730 --> 01:18:57,770
so than upper midwest Upper East Midwest
sorry region

1323
01:18:57,770 --> 01:19:00,840
arm everything we talked about was
reflected

1324
01:19:00,840 --> 01:19:04,520
when the soccer game conditions updated
what you see at the top there there like

1325
01:19:04,520 --> 01:19:08,910
arm the prices for gasoline and diesel
and jet fuel

1326
01:19:08,910 --> 01:19:13,290
average regional area there's also a
measure others like social unrest

1327
01:19:13,290 --> 01:19:16,760
the kinds of like economic a effects if
this

1328
01:19:16,760 --> 01:19:19,989
an peak oil crisis that kinda thing

1329
01:19:19,989 --> 01:19:23,360
so the whole game system was actually
directly responsive to the players

1330
01:19:23,360 --> 01:19:28,699
as opposed to you stopping okay

1331
01:19:28,699 --> 01:19:32,870
I am anyway very quickly in conclusion

1332
01:19:32,870 --> 01:19:36,099
this is other for me the lists

1333
01:19:36,099 --> 01:19:39,190
doing a system that is a game that takes

1334
01:19:39,190 --> 01:19:42,179
disorder would mature conditions a
reality ask people think critically

1335
01:19:42,179 --> 01:19:43,370
about it together

1336
01:19:43,370 --> 01:19:48,860
arm is and I guess

1337
01:19:48,860 --> 01:19:51,860
the I mean this is an opportunity for me
first make a really

1338
01:19:51,860 --> 01:19:54,219
something to change was actually
interesting is isn't in the in the

1339
01:19:54,219 --> 01:19:55,469
research afterwards

1340
01:19:55,469 --> 01:19:58,670
arm the people who may work but will
that will point

1341
01:19:58,670 --> 01:20:01,809
out but it's not just about raising
awareness actually encourage people to

1342
01:20:01,809 --> 01:20:02,410
make some just

1343
01:20:02,410 --> 01:20:06,269
substantive changes in the way that they
lived in the way they communicated with

1344
01:20:06,270 --> 01:20:09,290
on their communities about

1345
01:20:09,290 --> 01:20:13,120
things like fossil fuel consumption on
the many different people's everyday

1346
01:20:13,120 --> 01:20:15,699
lives as well as the way that thought
about

1347
01:20:15,699 --> 01:20:18,849
assertive conditions and instructions a
power

1348
01:20:18,849 --> 01:20:22,040
on that mean those things the case on

1349
01:20:22,040 --> 01:20:25,760
just very quickly a on

1350
01:20:25,760 --> 01:20:28,690
there's a sort of like my research
question going forward from this is our

1351
01:20:28,690 --> 01:20:29,739
house our understanding is

1352
01:20:29,739 --> 01:20:33,630
game-based learning change we think the
game not as a means to deliver content

1353
01:20:33,630 --> 01:20:37,210
rather way to facilitate dialogue on as
I mentioned I'm be working on his new

1354
01:20:37,210 --> 01:20:37,849
game

1355
01:20:37,849 --> 01:20:41,370
from some the same people who brought
the world world without oil on called

1356
01:20:41,370 --> 01:20:43,239
future cuz that's about climate change

1357
01:20:43,239 --> 01:20:46,389
on and this sorted thinking

1358
01:20:46,389 --> 01:20:51,080
through a different educational paradigm
on is something that

1359
01:20:51,080 --> 01:20:54,360
I'm excited to bring this project on and

1360
01:20:54,360 --> 01:20:57,420
again the slides will be up on my
website but without that word

1361
01:20:57,420 --> 01:21:00,730
om but business and the people

1362
01:21:00,730 --> 01:21:04,210
and things to which I refer generally
and would have

1363
01:21:04,210 --> 01:21:07,540
in the longer version the stock arm so

1364
01:21:07,540 --> 01:21:10,949
please hit me up on the Internet I do
wanna talk to more people about this sir

1365
01:21:10,949 --> 01:21:16,849
thank you 100 memory loss for Barker
called minutes we present you know

1366
01:21:16,849 --> 01:21:20,080
overrun the previous car accident
Gourgeon to go to

1367
01:21:20,080 --> 01:21:23,469
sensory research dotnet slash hope

1368
01:21:23,469 --> 01:21:27,449
number nine and all have links to all
the other things there

1369
01:21:27,449 --> 01:21:30,820
so that you can %uh follow through
