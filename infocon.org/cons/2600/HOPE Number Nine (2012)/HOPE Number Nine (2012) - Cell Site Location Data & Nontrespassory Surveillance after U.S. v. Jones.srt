1
00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:04,140
again and I can leave you guys let me
come talk to you twice

2
00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:07,569
here's occurs Friday

3
00:00:07,569 --> 00:00:12,730
I'll that's not going to work they say
the camera adds a

4
00:00:12,730 --> 00:00:16,619
15 pounds cell must be like 30 cameras
on alright

5
00:00:16,619 --> 00:00:19,830
hopefully we can get the slides going in
up their ego

6
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:23,460
every much better RI yeah this is much
better

7
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:27,529
okay so I'm here today to talk to you
folks about cell site location date and

8
00:00:27,529 --> 00:00:31,710
entrees passeri surveillance ap United
States persons Jones in handy for quick

9
00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:35,090
and a staff attorney with the Electronic
Frontier Foundation and I want to say

10
00:00:35,090 --> 00:00:36,960
thank you for civil for all of your

11
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:41,829
generosity to our organization you are
the people we strive to serve so

12
00:00:41,829 --> 00:00:46,160
thank you thank you thank you very much
now what

13
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:49,800
am I talking about today cell site
location data in on trespass re

14
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:51,440
surveillance it sounds like a punching

15
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:55,620
gobbledygook when I'm really here to
talk to you too folks today about

16
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:58,660
is location privacy after

17
00:00:58,660 --> 00:01:01,949
the US Supreme Court's decision in
United States persons Jones

18
00:01:01,949 --> 00:01:06,750
we're going to talk about Jones in a lot
more detail but just for anyone who

19
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:10,340
doesn't know what Jones is it's
basically a supreme court case from

20
00:01:10,340 --> 00:01:11,880
January of this year

21
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:16,960
where the Supreme Court held that the
physical installation a GPS device

22
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:20,540
constituted a search under the fourth
amendment

23
00:01:20,540 --> 00:01:23,610
and we're gonna go through more detail

24
00:01:23,610 --> 00:01:27,549
then you maybe wanna know about that
case but it's important detail because

25
00:01:27,549 --> 00:01:28,420
it really

26
00:01:28,420 --> 00:01:32,009
shows not only what the case 24

27
00:01:32,009 --> 00:01:36,320
and its limitations but importantly the
future fights were gonna have

28
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:41,560
in terms of dealing with location
privacy in the years and decades to come

29
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:42,250
okay

30
00:01:42,250 --> 00:01:45,310
cell what is

31
00:01:45,310 --> 00:01:49,990
cell site location data you all in this
room are probably far more

32
00:01:49,990 --> 00:01:54,520
technologically sophisticated than I am
in could probably

33
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:59,189
answer this question better than I could
but just so we have you know a uniform

34
00:01:59,189 --> 00:02:01,070
understanding of what I'm going to talk
about

35
00:02:01,070 --> 00:02:05,549
very briefly all i'm talking about today
in terms of cell site location data

36
00:02:05,549 --> 00:02:10,459
is the information stored in cell phone
towers by cell phone providers

37
00:02:10,459 --> 00:02:14,680
as you are trying to you know make a
phone call or just walking down the

38
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:16,959
street so if you walk down on seventh
Avenue

39
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:20,099
you've got your cell phone in your
pocket you pull it out because you wanna

40
00:02:20,099 --> 00:02:24,470
make a phone call or send a text message
ur whatever it you know you pull out

41
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:29,190
your prize in customer you have four
bars on AT&T customer yet half a bar

42
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:33,720
on it that service strain that signal
strength

43
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:37,420
is is really what we're talking about
because every time

44
00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:40,280
the phone is you know you're walking
down the street that phone is

45
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:42,470
establishing a connection with a
cellphone tower

46
00:02:42,470 --> 00:02:46,950
and the providers are keeping a record
which cell phone tower your particular

47
00:02:46,950 --> 00:02:48,050
phone number in Iraq's

48
00:02:48,050 --> 00:02:51,980
now through technological advances

49
00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:56,410
the government has been able to
basically go to providers and get this

50
00:02:56,410 --> 00:02:57,329
information

51
00:02:57,330 --> 00:03:01,129
and again we're going to talk about how
they do that a little bit later on

52
00:03:01,129 --> 00:03:05,060
but I wanted to start by just laying out
the foundation the ground workers

53
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:08,409
what exactly the technology is that
we're dealing with today

54
00:03:08,409 --> 00:03:13,840
sup let's talk briefly about sources on
legal protection you have

55
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:17,629
with respect to cell site location data

56
00:03:17,629 --> 00:03:21,579
well first you have your protection
under the fourth amendment okay

57
00:03:21,580 --> 00:03:26,069
the fourth amendment generally prohibits
unreasonable searches and seizures and

58
00:03:26,069 --> 00:03:29,739
what that really means is that in order
for the police to any law enforcement

59
00:03:29,739 --> 00:03:30,450
agency

60
00:03:30,450 --> 00:03:34,450
to search your electronic device where
to seize

61
00:03:34,450 --> 00:03:37,510
your electronic device they have to get
a search warrant

62
00:03:37,510 --> 00:03:42,679
in a search warrant all there really is
is a law enforcement officer goes to a

63
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:43,260
judge

64
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:48,048
ants wears out an affidavit and says
they have probable cause to believe

65
00:03:48,049 --> 00:03:51,890
that there's evidence to be found in the
thing they want to search for that thing

66
00:03:51,890 --> 00:03:52,780
they want to take

67
00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:58,120
okay so that's the first or some legal
protection we have for this type of data

68
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:59,290
before them in

69
00:03:59,290 --> 00:04:02,629
the second type up legal protection we
have is

70
00:04:02,629 --> 00:04:06,269
from the Electronic Communications
Privacy Act or as we

71
00:04:06,269 --> 00:04:11,159
affectionately call it ECB now exper is
complicated there are lot a different

72
00:04:11,159 --> 00:04:12,569
parts and exper

73
00:04:12,569 --> 00:04:16,400
I'm not going to bore you all with that
but I think there's

74
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:19,500
there really two important part to the
fact that we should be focusing on so

75
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:21,269
the first part that we need to focus on

76
00:04:21,269 --> 00:04:24,610
is this provisional data that says that
you have to

77
00:04:24,610 --> 00:04:27,970
that the government has to get a search
warrant install a quote unquote tracking

78
00:04:27,970 --> 00:04:29,229
device

79
00:04:29,229 --> 00:04:33,580
now what isn't is not be tracking device

80
00:04:33,580 --> 00:04:36,609
is complicated and this is the
definition

81
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:40,669
up tracking device under federal law
it's an electronic or mechanical device

82
00:04:40,669 --> 00:04:42,000
which permits the tracking

83
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,220
the movement other person object now

84
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:49,139
again I don't wanna bore you with the
time %uh dance legal argument but

85
00:04:49,139 --> 00:04:52,400
suffice it to say that a cell phone

86
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:56,210
for purposes %uh ek per is not a
tracking device

87
00:04:56,210 --> 00:04:59,229
and that is why there are some

88
00:04:59,229 --> 00:05:03,060
constitutional in statutory questions
surrounding

89
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:06,690
what type the legal showing the
government has to make in order to get

90
00:05:06,690 --> 00:05:11,330
access to cell site location data and in
fact the legislative history

91
00:05:11,330 --> 00:05:15,090
from act but which was enacted in 1986

92
00:05:15,090 --> 00:05:19,169
shows that when they define this term a
tracking device with a

93
00:05:19,169 --> 00:05:23,320
really were trying to capture is
basically beeper technology

94
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:26,789
this is like a little cloning device
that they would place on something

95
00:05:26,789 --> 00:05:30,050
and then follow the little red bebe as
it was driving down the street so this

96
00:05:30,050 --> 00:05:35,389
was far removed from the actual state of
technology that we have today

97
00:05:35,389 --> 00:05:38,830
so keep that in mind now

98
00:05:38,830 --> 00:05:42,159
for those if you want to go to law
school I guess what you're in luck

99
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:42,759
you're gonna get

100
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:46,289
a five-minute crash course on the fourth
amendment I just saved you all a hundred

101
00:05:46,289 --> 00:05:47,940
fifty thousand dollars

102
00:05:47,940 --> 00:05:51,120
you can I think me with a donation to
the it up later okay

103
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:55,669
now again this is important because it's
gonna frame our discussion and Jones in

104
00:05:55,669 --> 00:05:56,870
our discussion up

105
00:05:56,870 --> 00:06:01,360
cell site location data later on in this
presentation and just as a quick after I

106
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:05,020
am gonna leave time at the end for
question so if you have questions

107
00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:10,130
I'm gonna take them but we're just gonna
say them to the very end okay

108
00:06:10,130 --> 00:06:14,229
so the real question under the fourth
amendment is what is in is not

109
00:06:14,229 --> 00:06:19,818
a search and are two cases that lay the
groundwork for what a surgeon search

110
00:06:19,819 --> 00:06:21,449
isn't the first case is a case called

111
00:06:21,449 --> 00:06:24,810
almost dead from the nineteen twenties
and in this case it was a wiretapping

112
00:06:24,810 --> 00:06:25,930
case

113
00:06:25,930 --> 00:06:30,880
the Supreme Court beauty excuse me held
that a search required a physical

114
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:35,150
invasion a property in other words
required a trespass

115
00:06:35,150 --> 00:06:39,800
in the homestead case because there was
no actual physical invasion a property

116
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:44,560
there was no search and that was the law
for almost forty years

117
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:48,810
then in 1967 the Supreme Court seemingly

118
00:06:48,810 --> 00:06:52,410
but as we later find out not really but
seemingly reversed

119
00:06:52,410 --> 00:06:56,569
olmstead when it held that a search did
not require

120
00:06:56,569 --> 00:06:59,910
a physical invasion a property or
trespass

121
00:06:59,910 --> 00:07:03,370
cats was also a wiretap case it was
about

122
00:07:03,370 --> 00:07:06,490
a a microphone that police at installing

123
00:07:06,490 --> 00:07:10,620
outside a public phone booths on they
were investigating evidence

124
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:14,080
I'll a illegal gambling and what

125
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:17,900
cats decided was it created a new
definition

126
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:21,729
what a search is and it said that
something could be a search

127
00:07:21,729 --> 00:07:25,590
any absence other physical invasion if
two things were met

128
00:07:25,590 --> 00:07:30,940
first there had to be a violation be
subjected expectation of privacy

129
00:07:30,940 --> 00:07:35,389
that means that whatever that thing that
is to be searched the person

130
00:07:35,389 --> 00:07:40,020
must have taken some sort of steps or
believe that that thing was going to

131
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:41,889
remain private

132
00:07:41,889 --> 00:07:46,639
second society would have to find that
expectation of privacy

133
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:51,810
reasonable we shorten this too the
reasonable expectation of privacy test

134
00:07:51,810 --> 00:07:55,160
and that is still to this day the test
to what constitutes

135
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:58,520
a search under the Fourth Amendment so
if some sort of police

136
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:01,930
action meets this definition and search

137
00:08:01,930 --> 00:08:05,919
so both the subjective expectation of
privacy and society will find that

138
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:07,948
expectation of privacy reasonable

139
00:08:07,949 --> 00:08:12,190
then whatever the government is doing is
a search and therefore requires a search

140
00:08:12,190 --> 00:08:12,830
warrant

141
00:08:12,830 --> 00:08:16,289
and less it falls under sum up the
exceptions to the search warrant

142
00:08:16,289 --> 00:08:19,479
rule which I'm not going to talk about
today

143
00:08:19,479 --> 00:08:22,818
so that's the crash course on what
searches

144
00:08:22,819 --> 00:08:26,139
under the fourth amendment the second
thing we have to talk about

145
00:08:26,139 --> 00:08:30,069
is the right to privacy in public
movements and there's a pair Supreme

146
00:08:30,069 --> 00:08:32,130
Court cases from the nineteen eighties

147
00:08:32,130 --> 00:08:36,659
that elaborated on this not in Carroll
and these were both cases that involved

148
00:08:36,659 --> 00:08:40,409
this beeper technology that the red
homing device that the cops are

149
00:08:40,409 --> 00:08:42,218
following from a distance

150
00:08:42,219 --> 00:08:45,540
in both those cases a transmitter was
attached to

151
00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:49,709
arm a suspect's car in one instance in
another instance

152
00:08:49,709 --> 00:08:54,279
a a Canada ether that the a defendant
was transporting

153
00:08:54,279 --> 00:08:58,180
inanimate a radio signal and ultimately
that signal was sent to receiver

154
00:08:58,180 --> 00:09:01,130
and the police and the receiver and
could followed the suspect from a

155
00:09:01,130 --> 00:09:03,470
distance without revealing their
location

156
00:09:03,470 --> 00:09:07,019
and the Supreme Court held that these
beepers did not violate

157
00:09:07,019 --> 00:09:11,110
a you know what they said that they are
there was no reasonable expectation of

158
00:09:11,110 --> 00:09:12,310
privacy

159
00:09:12,310 --> 00:09:15,769
in a person's movements on public
streets now

160
00:09:15,769 --> 00:09:19,760
it distinguished between using this type
of technology

161
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:22,920
in the home but it said in terms love

162
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:26,160
walking down the street or driving down
the street you have no reasonable

163
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:28,329
expectation of privacy

164
00:09:28,330 --> 00:09:32,890
because you're voluntarily conveying to
anyone who wanted to look

165
00:09:32,890 --> 00:09:36,080
where you were going okay so

166
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:39,140
that's the second important concept
under the fourth amendment that we have

167
00:09:39,140 --> 00:09:40,120
to understand

168
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:44,399
and the third important concept is
what's called the third party doctrine

169
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:49,300
now this is born at a pair of cases from
the nineteen seventies that involved

170
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:52,580
whether a person could challenge a
search

171
00:09:52,580 --> 00:09:57,930
a I'd or a seizure rather by the
government Surin records held by someone

172
00:09:57,930 --> 00:09:58,600
else

173
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:02,500
and what the supreme court held was that
you had no right to privacy

174
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:07,110
information that's knowingly turned over
to third parties

175
00:10:07,110 --> 00:10:10,670
Miller involved bank records Smith
involved

176
00:10:10,670 --> 00:10:14,899
the phone numbers you die all in order
to make a phone call

177
00:10:14,899 --> 00:10:19,350
now what's important about these two
cases is that in a dissenting opinion

178
00:10:19,350 --> 00:10:22,839
justice marshall this is specifically in
the Smith opinion

179
00:10:22,839 --> 00:10:26,890
you really questioned this idea other
third-party doctor anyway he

180
00:10:26,890 --> 00:10:30,870
really was upset about was he did not
believe

181
00:10:30,870 --> 00:10:34,329
there was any real choice when you use

182
00:10:34,329 --> 00:10:39,540
certain kinds of technology because the
only alternative to turning over this

183
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:43,399
your information which in smith again it
was the phone numbers you dont make a

184
00:10:43,399 --> 00:10:44,200
phone call

185
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:47,410
the only alternative is to not use that
type of technology at all

186
00:10:47,410 --> 00:10:50,500
so he questioned whether there really
was any choice

187
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:54,100
in the matter the other important point

188
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:58,190
he made is he did not believe that
privacy

189
00:10:58,190 --> 00:11:01,540
was a all or nothing proposition and

190
00:11:01,540 --> 00:11:04,849
very kind of a mess and really nice
quote he has is

191
00:11:04,850 --> 00:11:08,300
that secrecy is not a prerequisite

192
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:11,550
to price this is i think is very

193
00:11:11,550 --> 00:11:17,240
very important mindset that we all need
to have in terms of how to combat

194
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:20,779
intrusions our Privacy going forward in
the future and as we'll see when we

195
00:11:20,779 --> 00:11:22,019
discuss Jones

196
00:11:22,019 --> 00:11:25,120
at least one Supreme Court Justice as
started to

197
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:29,980
pay attention to what Justice Marshall
said in Smith

198
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:33,540
now houdini's

199
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:37,910
ek her and cell site location data how
they interact so we talked about the

200
00:11:37,910 --> 00:11:38,769
fourth amendment

201
00:11:38,769 --> 00:11:42,690
let's talk about actor for a sec the
government has argued

202
00:11:42,690 --> 00:11:46,750
it can obtain cell site location data
without a search warrant

203
00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:50,920
because it's a record other information
pertaining to a subscriber

204
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:54,130
here's how their argument works under

205
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:57,360
title 18 USC 2703

206
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:01,850
you are permitted to obtain a record or
other information pertaining to

207
00:12:01,850 --> 00:12:02,980
Subscriber

208
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:08,250
under a another section up 27 a 3d
specifically

209
00:12:08,250 --> 00:12:11,260
under subsection twice in a 3-2
specifically

210
00:12:11,260 --> 00:12:16,600
27 a 3d and 2703 d says that records or
other information pertaining to a

211
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:17,639
subscriber

212
00:12:17,639 --> 00:12:21,310
can be obtained through specific and
articulable facts showing that there are

213
00:12:21,310 --> 00:12:24,279
reasonable grounds to believe that the
contents of a wire electronic

214
00:12:24,279 --> 00:12:25,399
communication

215
00:12:25,399 --> 00:12:28,570
or the records and other information
sought irrelevant material to an ongoing

216
00:12:28,570 --> 00:12:33,519
criminal investigation after thinking
what the hell does that mean

217
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:38,010
the important parts are in red the
government can get this data at least

218
00:12:38,010 --> 00:12:39,439
that's what they've argued

219
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:43,470
under is showing specific an articulable
facts

220
00:12:43,470 --> 00:12:46,829
the show there's reasonable grounds to
believe the contents

221
00:12:46,829 --> 00:12:50,560
are relevant in material to a criminal
investigation the most important thing

222
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:51,790
to take from this

223
00:12:51,790 --> 00:12:55,180
is that this is not the search warrant
probable cause

224
00:12:55,180 --> 00:12:58,230
standard to the probable cause standard
means

225
00:12:58,230 --> 00:13:01,889
that the government has to have probable
cause to believe that

226
00:13:01,889 --> 00:13:04,889
evidence other crime will be obtained

227
00:13:04,889 --> 00:13:08,510
from the place that they want to search
this is not

228
00:13:08,510 --> 00:13:14,230
that standard it is a lesser standard

229
00:13:14,230 --> 00:13:18,930
now before the jones case

230
00:13:18,930 --> 00:13:23,490
the issue of whether or what type of
standard was required in order to get

231
00:13:23,490 --> 00:13:25,490
cell site location data

232
00:13:25,490 --> 00:13:28,800
resulted in a split opinion and really

233
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:33,940
what the issue hinged on was kinda a
combination I can flash in

234
00:13:33,940 --> 00:13:38,630
%uh ek per and the fourth amendment okay

235
00:13:38,630 --> 00:13:43,250
on so some courts have held that cell
site location data can be disclosed

236
00:13:43,250 --> 00:13:44,620
without a search warrant

237
00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:49,160
under the third party doctrine the idea
that you have no privacy rights

238
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:52,380
in records that are held by third
parties okay and they've

239
00:13:52,380 --> 00:13:56,019
in these two cases are just an example
but they basically follow through the

240
00:13:56,019 --> 00:13:59,610
Supreme Court cases in Smith & Miller
and say look

241
00:13:59,610 --> 00:14:03,680
as a cell phone customer to briseno AT&T
or whatever

242
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:08,230
you are knowingly turning over your
location effectively because you're

243
00:14:08,230 --> 00:14:10,220
demanding service from the provider

244
00:14:10,220 --> 00:14:13,850
and in order to do that they have to
create a record they create that record

245
00:14:13,850 --> 00:14:14,670
as a means a

246
00:14:14,670 --> 00:14:18,100
furthering their business and it's
created

247
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:21,500
at you know for business purposes not
for law enforcement purposes and

248
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:22,550
therefore

249
00:14:22,550 --> 00:14:26,370
the third party doctrine controls it
does not require surgery

250
00:14:26,370 --> 00:14:31,149
okay other courts have required a
warrant

251
00:14:31,149 --> 00:14:36,800
and their rationale is that cell site
location data reveal sensitive data

252
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:41,540
in contention intrude in the home
importantly these courts have

253
00:14:41,540 --> 00:14:45,889
look at justice marshall's dissenting
opinion an idea that these records are

254
00:14:45,889 --> 00:14:49,000
actually not voluntarily given over and
there's

255
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:52,779
a number of different reasons for that
some courts have looked and said look

256
00:14:52,779 --> 00:14:56,170
you may sign a contract agreement
effectively

257
00:14:56,170 --> 00:15:00,860
like you look and you nobody reads these
things everyone its 50 100 pages it's

258
00:15:00,860 --> 00:15:03,699
raining lightly with lawyers can even
understand to read

259
00:15:03,699 --> 00:15:07,690
people just sign in whatever so they're
not knowingly turning that over

260
00:15:07,690 --> 00:15:11,220
okay and importantly this idea that this

261
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:14,389
information reveal sensitive data

262
00:15:14,389 --> 00:15:18,320
and could potentially if precise enough
intrude into the home

263
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:23,070
takes it outside the realm love knots in
Caro the cases that talked about public

264
00:15:23,070 --> 00:15:24,040
movements

265
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:27,380
on public streets because if once we
going to the home

266
00:15:27,380 --> 00:15:31,620
the Fourth Amendment protections are
much much stronger okay

267
00:15:31,620 --> 00:15:36,339
so this is kinda the state of the law
before the jones case

268
00:15:36,339 --> 00:15:39,940
so now let's shift gears and talk about
Jones

269
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:45,009
and we'll talk how it kinda Impax cell
site location data so

270
00:15:45,009 --> 00:15:48,230
the fax Jones basically the police

271
00:15:48,230 --> 00:15:51,480
were investigating Jones for drug crimes

272
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:56,120
and they applied in obtained a search
warrant that allow them to install a GPS

273
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:57,199
device

274
00:15:57,199 --> 00:16:00,459
in the district of columbia within 10
days

275
00:16:00,459 --> 00:16:03,709
so the federal government being the
federal government decided to wait 11

276
00:16:03,709 --> 00:16:04,290
days

277
00:16:04,290 --> 00:16:08,079
and waited until Jones was in Maryland
and then decided to install the GPS

278
00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:09,060
device

279
00:16:09,060 --> 00:16:13,500
because it was installed outside the
parameters are the limits of the search

280
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:14,089
warrant

281
00:16:14,089 --> 00:16:17,820
it effectively was a warrantless search

282
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:21,759
okay now on appeal

283
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:25,370
the DC Circuit found that this violated
the Fourth Amendment right

284
00:16:25,370 --> 00:16:28,579
to be free from unreasonable searches
and seizures and

285
00:16:28,579 --> 00:16:31,730
they base their decision on what's been
called this a

286
00:16:31,730 --> 00:16:34,889
the mosaic theory what the mosaic

287
00:16:34,889 --> 00:16:38,029
peery and what the DC Circuit said

288
00:16:38,029 --> 00:16:42,139
was that even though Jones exposed
individual trips

289
00:16:42,139 --> 00:16:46,870
to the public meaning he may have driven
five blocks down the street in anybody

290
00:16:46,870 --> 00:16:48,300
could see that

291
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:53,620
he didn't actually or constructively
expose the entirety of his movements

292
00:16:53,620 --> 00:16:54,870
over the period of time

293
00:16:54,870 --> 00:16:59,029
in which he was tracked which I forgot
to mention in in this case was 28 days

294
00:16:59,029 --> 00:17:00,649
so the police followed him

295
00:17:00,649 --> 00:17:05,780
to GPS for 28 days they said even though
he may have disclosed discrete trips

296
00:17:05,780 --> 00:17:10,000
he didn't knowingly or constructively or
actually

297
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:14,699
expose his movements for almost a month
because nobody in their right mind

298
00:17:14,699 --> 00:17:18,959
would believe that anybody would follow
them around for a month now after going

299
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:19,510
to

300
00:17:19,510 --> 00:17:23,179
the talk yesterday about drones that
that may not be true anymore

301
00:17:23,179 --> 00:17:26,500
but at least at the time that this case
was decided that was what

302
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:30,750
this that DC Circuit hell and what in a
very important holding the cum

303
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:34,570
added this is the idea that there's an
acknowledgement a greater privacy

304
00:17:34,570 --> 00:17:37,668
interest in the pattern or aggregation a

305
00:17:37,669 --> 00:17:41,539
individual movements then in each
individual discrete movement in and of

306
00:17:41,539 --> 00:17:42,379
itself

307
00:17:42,380 --> 00:17:47,470
okay so the government was the one who
asked the Supreme Court to review the

308
00:17:47,470 --> 00:17:50,820
supreme court agreed and the issue
before the Supreme Court was whether

309
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:54,360
detachment at the GPS tracking device to
an individual's vehicle

310
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:57,970
in subsequent use the device to monitor
the vehicle's movements on public

311
00:17:57,970 --> 00:18:00,120
streets is a search or seizure within
the meaning

312
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:04,460
the fourth men okay now

313
00:18:04,460 --> 00:18:07,910
on the jones case was argued in November
and

314
00:18:07,910 --> 00:18:12,160
a tunnel organizations filed an amicus
briefs including the AFF

315
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:16,309
we got the guy who invented GPS to sign
onto our brief which was pretty awesome

316
00:18:16,309 --> 00:18:20,830
on and the court issued its decision in
January this year

317
00:18:20,830 --> 00:18:24,820
and it's actually a pretty for Supreme
Court opinion is actually a

318
00:18:24,820 --> 00:18:29,220
pretty easy read I think someone without
a legal background could definitely read

319
00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:33,090
I'd encourage olive you to read it you
know it's not like the health care case

320
00:18:33,090 --> 00:18:34,689
which I tried looking at night

321
00:18:34,690 --> 00:18:39,390
can figure it out so I put it away on
but basically the jones case

322
00:18:39,390 --> 00:18:42,760
resulted in three opinions and each
other's opinions are very important

323
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:46,230
so the first opinion is the majority
opinion written by Justice Scalia

324
00:18:46,230 --> 00:18:50,390
and what he held was that the government
occupation a private property for the

325
00:18:50,390 --> 00:18:53,789
purpose of obtaining information is a
search

326
00:18:53,789 --> 00:18:57,100
so he goes back to the homestead test

327
00:18:57,100 --> 00:19:00,410
the physical trespass and what he says

328
00:19:00,410 --> 00:19:04,919
is that the cats reasonable expectation
of privacy test

329
00:19:04,919 --> 00:19:08,169
did not substitute for

330
00:19:08,169 --> 00:19:12,940
the trespass test instead it was added
to so that means there's now actually

331
00:19:12,940 --> 00:19:13,650
two ways

332
00:19:13,650 --> 00:19:16,720
the fourth amendment can be violated
either through this trespass

333
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:20,320
or through a violation a reasonable
expectation price

334
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:23,450
okay so that actually pretty
groundbreaking is that's the first time

335
00:19:23,450 --> 00:19:25,070
the supreme court's ever held that

336
00:19:25,070 --> 00:19:28,899
actually both test are correct

337
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:33,510
so this is a good holding for the
physical attachment

338
00:19:33,510 --> 00:19:37,020
a GPS devices but it doesn't really help
us

339
00:19:37,020 --> 00:19:41,139
in cell site location data cuz ur is no
physical installation and

340
00:19:41,140 --> 00:19:44,720
justice scalia very specifically says
yeah

341
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:48,250
that's that's true we don't have to
decide the case

342
00:19:48,250 --> 00:19:51,169
through the reasonable expectation of
privacy test so we're just gonna leave

343
00:19:51,169 --> 00:19:51,510
it

344
00:19:51,510 --> 00:19:56,070
that for another day alright the second
opinion is a concurring opinion by

345
00:19:56,070 --> 00:19:57,860
Justice Alito and he

346
00:19:57,860 --> 00:20:01,450
does not agree that this trespass test

347
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:04,549
decides the issue instead he says

348
00:20:04,549 --> 00:20:08,559
the reasonable expectation of privacy
test controls and his rule would be the

349
00:20:08,559 --> 00:20:10,970
use of longer-term GPS monitoring

350
00:20:10,970 --> 00:20:15,690
investigations up most offenses impinges
on expectations uprights

351
00:20:15,690 --> 00:20:20,429
now unfortunately he doesn't bother to
explain what the words longer-term

352
00:20:20,429 --> 00:20:23,880
or most offenses means he says

353
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:27,110
28 days is definitely there and that's
the end of that so

354
00:20:27,110 --> 00:20:32,419
under his theory there's room to figure
out what you know is one day enough is

355
00:20:32,419 --> 00:20:33,419
five days enough

356
00:20:33,419 --> 00:20:37,020
I don't know the answer to that under
justice leaders theory is a murder case

357
00:20:37,020 --> 00:20:38,250
okay for

358
00:20:38,250 --> 00:20:41,830
GPS the tracking how bout a drug case

359
00:20:41,830 --> 00:20:45,100
we don't really know its is left to
kinda day

360
00:20:45,100 --> 00:20:49,190
but when he does say and what's very
important going forward is he notes that

361
00:20:49,190 --> 00:20:53,299
in the past our greatest privacy
protections work

362
00:20:53,299 --> 00:20:58,830
technological in a sense that it's just
impractical for the police to follow

363
00:20:58,830 --> 00:21:00,918
somebody for 28 days with

364
00:21:00,919 --> 00:21:04,240
I cops in an unmarked car in a box it
down it's

365
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:07,650
and big jug coffee about following your
every movement

366
00:21:07,650 --> 00:21:10,650
it's just not likely its impossible

367
00:21:10,650 --> 00:21:14,860
11 even argue up but because the rapid
advances

368
00:21:14,860 --> 00:21:19,230
in technology what's happening is these
things that once seemed

369
00:21:19,230 --> 00:21:24,559
impossible or extremely difficult and
now we only be used very very sparingly

370
00:21:24,559 --> 00:21:27,918
are now able to be used easily

371
00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:31,010
in cheaply and for things that are not
all that

372
00:21:31,010 --> 00:21:35,679
that we would consider you know
traditionally very serious

373
00:21:35,679 --> 00:21:39,440
he also notes that legislatures have to
be the ones to step in and that he notes

374
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:39,840
that

375
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:43,959
traditionally it has been the
legislature to dictate what people's

376
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:47,929
expectations our privacy our leader in a
better position to gauge what

377
00:21:47,929 --> 00:21:50,620
expectations a privacy people had in
society

378
00:21:50,620 --> 00:21:53,929
rather than the courts any notes that as
technology advances

379
00:21:53,929 --> 00:21:58,240
many people may be willing to sacrifice
their privacy

380
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:01,270
for the convenience is a technology
meaning like it

381
00:22:01,270 --> 00:22:04,389
people like to check in on Foursquare
Facebook or whatever

382
00:22:04,390 --> 00:22:08,350
and if that means giving away your
location then so be it

383
00:22:08,350 --> 00:22:12,360
at now I'm fairly confident that most
people in this room wouldn't agree with

384
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:12,980
that but

385
00:22:12,980 --> 00:22:16,970
and I think unfortunately the reality is
to a lot of people outside this room

386
00:22:16,970 --> 00:22:20,490
down on seventh Avenue may be visiting
New York City for the first time

387
00:22:20,490 --> 00:22:24,659
they may be very comfortable disclosing
that where they are at any particular

388
00:22:24,659 --> 00:22:27,950
okay that's something to think about and
finally

389
00:22:27,950 --> 00:22:31,809
we had the concurring opinion Justice or
my or not she basically agrees with both

390
00:22:31,809 --> 00:22:33,780
Scalia and Alito said she thinks

391
00:22:33,780 --> 00:22:37,049
the trespass theory is correct

392
00:22:37,049 --> 00:22:40,360
she also thinks that there needs to be
an analysis under the reasonable

393
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:41,950
expectation of privacy test

394
00:22:41,950 --> 00:22:45,360
she thinks that this surveillance
violated a reasonable expectation of

395
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:46,140
privacy

396
00:22:46,140 --> 00:22:49,929
she also agrees with Justice Alito about
on

397
00:22:49,929 --> 00:22:53,320
the fact that technology advances could
potentially

398
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:57,710
a road our expectations of privacy and
that we have to be vigilant

399
00:22:57,710 --> 00:23:01,480
in and protecting them but most
importantly in what I'm gonna probably

400
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:03,710
focus the rest the my comments on

401
00:23:03,710 --> 00:23:06,980
is she is the one to skydive set

402
00:23:06,980 --> 00:23:11,120
the signal of that it's time to
reexamine the third party doctrine

403
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:15,480
and what she says is that this approach
is ill-suited for the digital age that

404
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:16,630
we live in where

405
00:23:16,630 --> 00:23:20,700
so much information is being turned over
and placed online whether it's through

406
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:22,700
cloud storage for people

407
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:26,000
walking around with smart phones in
their pocket and having their email in

408
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,289
their financial data and all sorts of
stuff

409
00:23:28,289 --> 00:23:32,370
contain on electronic devices okay now

410
00:23:32,370 --> 00:23:35,960
this is all this is a great

411
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:39,370
first step in the right direction that
were even having

412
00:23:39,370 --> 00:23:43,059
judges on the Supreme Court in United
States actually thinking about this

413
00:23:43,059 --> 00:23:47,110
because up until the jones case there
really hasn't been

414
00:23:47,110 --> 00:23:52,909
any location privacy cases since the
1980s when not sin Cara were decide

415
00:23:52,909 --> 00:23:55,960
so this is in this in my opinion this is
a great

416
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:59,510
starting point but there's a lot more
work to be done

417
00:23:59,510 --> 00:24:04,549
so what is this state the law regarding
cell site location data after John's

418
00:24:04,549 --> 00:24:05,059
well

419
00:24:05,059 --> 00:24:08,520
unfortunately the courts remains let so

420
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:12,840
after the jones case your example the
two cases that went out the opposite way

421
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:16,010
in pit which is a massachusetts state
court case

422
00:24:16,010 --> 00:24:20,770
it relies on the concurring opinions and
Jones to find itself a location data

423
00:24:20,770 --> 00:24:23,799
obtaining it without a search warrant
would violate a reasonable expectation

424
00:24:23,799 --> 00:24:25,168
of privacy

425
00:24:25,169 --> 00:24:28,779
and it not only touches upon the
concurring opinions and Jones but it

426
00:24:28,779 --> 00:24:30,090
also touches upon

427
00:24:30,090 --> 00:24:33,309
the prior opinions that it found
disciple

428
00:24:33,309 --> 00:24:38,049
a searching to be I'll unconstitutional
without a search warrant

429
00:24:38,049 --> 00:24:41,918
noting that users don't really
voluntarily turn this information over

430
00:24:41,919 --> 00:24:45,870
that it has the potential to reveal far
greater sensitive information

431
00:24:45,870 --> 00:24:49,429
and you know also noting that the third
party doctrine should and control this

432
00:24:49,429 --> 00:24:54,029
outcome Graham which is a a federal
court case at a Maryland went the

433
00:24:54,029 --> 00:24:55,960
opposite way and basically said look

434
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:59,440
you know Justice Alito and and Sarah
Myers opinions are really nice they're

435
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:00,750
they're very well written in there

436
00:25:00,750 --> 00:25:03,870
but they're concurring opinions that
majority didn't hold that the third

437
00:25:03,870 --> 00:25:07,880
party doctrine still survives

438
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:11,760
unfortunately what we're seeing now is
we're seeing different standards amongst

439
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:13,408
different law enforcement agencies

440
00:25:13,409 --> 00:25:17,070
and we're seeing lots and lots and lots
request so

441
00:25:17,070 --> 00:25:21,379
in March the ACLU released the the
results before your request that show

442
00:25:21,380 --> 00:25:22,029
that

443
00:25:22,029 --> 00:25:25,740
throughout the country different law
enforcement agencies were using

444
00:25:25,740 --> 00:25:26,470
different types

445
00:25:26,470 --> 00:25:29,450
judicial process to get access to the
state and I encourage everyone to go

446
00:25:29,450 --> 00:25:30,510
check out

447
00:25:30,510 --> 00:25:34,230
there on their website they had the
resulting you can do a search by your

448
00:25:34,230 --> 00:25:37,130
state or county or whatever to figure
out what your local law enforcement

449
00:25:37,130 --> 00:25:38,650
agencies doing

450
00:25:38,650 --> 00:25:42,059
but for example in the state of Hawaii
the police were using search warrants to

451
00:25:42,059 --> 00:25:43,340
get this data

452
00:25:43,340 --> 00:25:48,250
meanwhile other state court a of it law
enforcement officials were getting it

453
00:25:48,250 --> 00:25:51,840
27 3d order some were trying to use
subpoenas

454
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:57,279
I gone to like a a talk with the US
attorney in the Bay Area in Oakland who

455
00:25:57,279 --> 00:25:58,260
said that she

456
00:25:58,260 --> 00:26:01,799
when he basically use a twenty-seven 3d
order to get this information

457
00:26:01,799 --> 00:26:05,918
so we're seeing the disparity in it and
discrepancies and how the state is being

458
00:26:05,919 --> 00:26:06,950
obtained

459
00:26:06,950 --> 00:26:11,230
and we're also seeing a rapid increase
in the number request that

460
00:26:11,230 --> 00:26:14,380
last week you know the New York Times
reported

461
00:26:14,380 --> 00:26:18,510
the results other request made by
representative markey of massachusetts

462
00:26:18,510 --> 00:26:22,480
asking cell phone providers to disclose
how many requests they'd received in the

463
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:23,770
year 2011

464
00:26:23,770 --> 00:26:28,590
and the number was I think 1.3 million
individual requests made

465
00:26:28,590 --> 00:26:31,630
to cell phone providers for information
now

466
00:26:31,630 --> 00:26:35,520
it wasn't just cell site location data
included you know requests for text

467
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:37,250
messages emails et cetera but

468
00:26:37,250 --> 00:26:40,799
certainly included in that was cell site
location did

469
00:26:40,799 --> 00:26:43,918
and even more problematic were these

470
00:26:43,919 --> 00:26:49,429
tower dumps where a law enforcement to
go to a provider and say hey

471
00:26:49,429 --> 00:26:53,679
we want all the data you have on this
particular cell phone tower

472
00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:57,120
on 7th and 34th and they just turn it
all over

473
00:26:57,120 --> 00:27:01,240
and it doesn't matter if it's one
person's info on there are 1000 people

474
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:02,470
have connected to that our

475
00:27:02,470 --> 00:27:06,900
the cops get all it and we don't know
how long to keeping it what they're

476
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:09,799
doing with it or what databases are
stowing with where

477
00:27:09,799 --> 00:27:12,679
you know a lot a lot in the civil
liberties community we're trying to

478
00:27:12,679 --> 00:27:14,460
figure that information out but

479
00:27:14,460 --> 00:27:17,710
we still are in the dark to certain
extent about some

480
00:27:17,710 --> 00:27:21,049
stuff and finally we've got

481
00:27:21,049 --> 00:27:24,220
deal J resisting a work requirement

482
00:27:24,220 --> 00:27:31,049
and on on May 3rd 2012 Jacob weinstein
who is an assistant attorney general

483
00:27:31,049 --> 00:27:33,120
told the panel in DC that

484
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:36,799
and requiring a search warrant would
quote cripple

485
00:27:36,799 --> 00:27:40,000
end quote law enforcement efforts

486
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:44,990
a because the police oftentimes you cell
site location data to develop probable

487
00:27:44,990 --> 00:27:46,730
cause

488
00:27:46,730 --> 00:27:49,809
in order it while investigating other
crimes so we're seeing

489
00:27:49,809 --> 00:27:53,210
a very strong push by law enforcement

490
00:27:53,210 --> 00:27:56,340
to you know challenge the notion that

491
00:27:56,340 --> 00:28:01,720
search warrants are required to access
the state

492
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:04,990
I think the most interesting things to
come out on

493
00:28:04,990 --> 00:28:08,760
the jones case in terms of how it in
Iraq's was so same location data

494
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:12,260
is really the third party doctrine I'll

495
00:28:12,260 --> 00:28:16,049
and I think we

496
00:28:16,049 --> 00:28:19,059
I don't wanna say we're seeing the
beginning at the end because I don't

497
00:28:19,059 --> 00:28:20,240
think we are

498
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:23,340
but we're starting to see be beginning
I'll

499
00:28:23,340 --> 00:28:27,130
the reexamination I'll the third party
doctrine

500
00:28:27,130 --> 00:28:30,470
and because cell site location data
records are

501
00:28:30,470 --> 00:28:33,850
records held by third parties

502
00:28:33,850 --> 00:28:37,039
AT&T Verizon T Mobile whatever on

503
00:28:37,039 --> 00:28:40,879
it's really gonna be the resolution up
the third party doctrine that

504
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:45,409
impacts how this area the law's going to
develop and the types of privacy

505
00:28:45,409 --> 00:28:48,840
protection that we're going to have in
the future

506
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:52,419
with that I'm gonna say little plugin
that is that third parties have to be

507
00:28:52,419 --> 00:28:53,529
transparent

508
00:28:53,529 --> 00:28:57,120
in limited and assertive when they do
get

509
00:28:57,120 --> 00:29:01,419
requests from law enforcement on how to
handle cell site location data because

510
00:29:01,419 --> 00:29:01,830
thats

511
00:29:01,830 --> 00:29:05,918
you know in a sense its its my rights
are in their hands

512
00:29:05,919 --> 00:29:09,190
and I hope that they're being
transparent limited and assertive and

513
00:29:09,190 --> 00:29:10,950
there's a case here in New York

514
00:29:10,950 --> 00:29:14,390
that I want to talk about in some detail
that I think kinda bring somebody's

515
00:29:14,390 --> 00:29:17,559
issues to head and I'm sure a lot of
people heard about this case but this is

516
00:29:17,559 --> 00:29:19,129
the case if people the Harris

517
00:29:19,130 --> 00:29:23,490
for those of you who haven't heard about
this case I'll give a brief recap

518
00:29:23,490 --> 00:29:29,740
Harris was wanna the people arrested on
the Brooklyn Bridge during an Occupy

519
00:29:29,740 --> 00:29:32,700
Wall Street protests in October of 2011

520
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:35,929
and he was charged with disorderly
conduct which is

521
00:29:35,929 --> 00:29:40,279
under New York law arm infraction which
is a step below

522
00:29:40,279 --> 00:29:43,159
a misdemeanor so it's a pretty minor
crime it's got a two hundred fifty

523
00:29:43,159 --> 00:29:44,820
dollar maximum fine

524
00:29:44,820 --> 00:29:48,950
or up to 15 days in jail not not the
most serious crime in the world

525
00:29:48,950 --> 00:29:52,210
and as part of their investigation the
New York City District Attorney's Office

526
00:29:52,210 --> 00:29:55,020
Rick sent a subpoena to Twitter

527
00:29:55,020 --> 00:29:59,330
asking for any and all information it
had about Harris

528
00:29:59,330 --> 00:30:04,889
arm over a three-month period of time
now he was arrested on October 1st 2011

529
00:30:04,890 --> 00:30:08,779
yet despite that very specific pinpoint
date

530
00:30:08,779 --> 00:30:12,000
and that is the only that is the only
day I'll

531
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:16,419
that the charges are based on not that
he was doing other things before that

532
00:30:16,419 --> 00:30:17,820
just solely on October I'll

533
00:30:17,820 --> 00:30:21,480
1st 2011 the government nonetheless
requested

534
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:25,039
all the information Twitter had on
Harris from September

535
00:30:25,039 --> 00:30:29,440
up 2011 all the way through December
2011 or in other words

536
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:32,830
after the crime had occur and

537
00:30:32,830 --> 00:30:35,830
that included tweets it included

538
00:30:35,830 --> 00:30:40,918
contact list included what's considered
basic subscriber information and this is

539
00:30:40,919 --> 00:30:42,059
where

540
00:30:42,059 --> 00:30:47,129
location date is important because party
the information on Twitter keeps

541
00:30:47,130 --> 00:30:50,870
is IP addresses now the majority of
people

542
00:30:50,870 --> 00:30:54,679
use Twitter on their cell so what that
means is if you

543
00:30:54,679 --> 00:30:57,880
post 82 if you login to Twitter on your
cell phone and you

544
00:30:57,880 --> 00:31:02,510
tweet and you twitter has a record in
the IP address your

545
00:31:02,510 --> 00:31:05,519
connecting from they technically
speaking

546
00:31:05,519 --> 00:31:10,039
had a record up this cell phone tower
you potentially connected to

547
00:31:10,039 --> 00:31:13,240
and particularly because Harris was

548
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:16,679
arrested on the Brooklyn Bridge I'm
going to assume he doesn't actually live

549
00:31:16,679 --> 00:31:17,919
on the Brooklyn Bridge

550
00:31:17,919 --> 00:31:21,890
it's safe to say that they were at least
you know we suspected

551
00:31:21,890 --> 00:31:24,940
that they were trying to get some
information about

552
00:31:24,940 --> 00:31:28,330
harris's location and they did this
through a subpoena

553
00:31:28,330 --> 00:31:32,399
not to search warrant now Harris with
the help of the good people love the

554
00:31:32,399 --> 00:31:33,299
energy

555
00:31:33,299 --> 00:31:37,110
on shout out to them ahead

556
00:31:37,110 --> 00:31:40,640
challenge this subpoena and what the
court held

557
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:43,789
was Harris had no

558
00:31:43,789 --> 00:31:46,890
legal standing to challenge the subpoena

559
00:31:46,890 --> 00:31:50,750
legal standing is the concept that you
are the one who has

560
00:31:50,750 --> 00:31:54,500
suffered some sort and injury in can
therefore bring in legal claim

561
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:57,929
and the court found that Harris had no
standing because he didn't own

562
00:31:57,929 --> 00:32:02,600
his own tweets rather that information
was owned by Twitter

563
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:06,779
and because Twitter was the one who
owned it Harris couldn't challenge

564
00:32:06,779 --> 00:32:10,789
sup Twitter thankfully awesome mad props
to them

565
00:32:10,789 --> 00:32:14,220
stood up and defended Harris effectively
and filed

566
00:32:14,220 --> 00:32:19,110
a motion challenging you know that
disclosure this information and we

567
00:32:19,110 --> 00:32:23,470
if that together with the ACLU public
knowledge filed an amicus brief

568
00:32:23,470 --> 00:32:26,610
in supportive Twitter and d'amato love
on our website

569
00:32:26,610 --> 00:32:30,049
and told them this is awesome this is
the exact thing we want to see a third

570
00:32:30,049 --> 00:32:30,730
party being

571
00:32:30,730 --> 00:32:33,799
transparent and attempting to be limited

572
00:32:33,799 --> 00:32:37,230
and most importantly being assertive on
behalf of one of its users

573
00:32:37,230 --> 00:32:40,640
so they filed this a challenge to the
subpoena

574
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:44,299
and just unfortunately however about I
think two weeks ago the judge issued

575
00:32:44,299 --> 00:32:47,700
another opinion basically same yeah what
I said in that first opinion why said

576
00:32:47,700 --> 00:32:48,890
you can challenge it

577
00:32:48,890 --> 00:32:52,659
it holds true here and what the court
said was you have no

578
00:32:52,659 --> 00:32:55,799
privacy rights information turned over
to third parties

579
00:32:55,799 --> 00:32:59,100
exactly this that third-party doc

580
00:32:59,100 --> 00:33:03,210
I am I'm confident that this case is
gonna go up to the court system in

581
00:33:03,210 --> 00:33:06,789
and hopefully will work its way up to
the

582
00:33:06,789 --> 00:33:09,940
New York order appellate court level in
in the court of appeals

583
00:33:09,940 --> 00:33:13,330
and I think we're gonna see other
examples this

584
00:33:13,330 --> 00:33:17,820
but we have to ask ourselves are other
third parties that we're storing data

585
00:33:17,820 --> 00:33:20,908
with particularly those who potentially
have

586
00:33:20,909 --> 00:33:25,049
records where we access our data in for
doing so over cellphone

587
00:33:25,049 --> 00:33:28,679
connection and technically our location
or potentially our location

588
00:33:28,679 --> 00:33:32,740
am are they gonna be assertive in the
same way that Twitter is

589
00:33:32,740 --> 00:33:37,289
that that that remains to be seen so

590
00:33:37,289 --> 00:33:40,629
would almost at the end here and then
we're going to take some questions but

591
00:33:40,630 --> 00:33:44,710
you're probably a hopefully well

592
00:33:44,710 --> 00:33:48,610
I'm sure you know I've said a lot of
doom and gloom but their is

593
00:33:48,610 --> 00:33:52,580
some stuff that you all can do to help
in this way

594
00:33:52,580 --> 00:33:55,850
so what can I do well one you can
continue FS

595
00:33:55,850 --> 00:33:59,409
fight on a cell site location data so
this is a case is

596
00:33:59,409 --> 00:34:02,909
this case it was that appear is the case
where the EFSF

597
00:34:02,909 --> 00:34:06,779
ACLU in the National Association of
Criminal Defense Lawyers in the Center

598
00:34:06,779 --> 00:34:08,489
for Democracy and technology

599
00:34:08,490 --> 00:34:11,960
have filed a brief in the 5th Circuit
Court of Appeals

600
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:16,099
I'm defending a judge who told the
government you can get cell site

601
00:34:16,099 --> 00:34:18,060
location data that a search warrant

602
00:34:18,060 --> 00:34:21,409
and we are looking for other cases where
these types of situations come up so

603
00:34:21,409 --> 00:34:22,310
know that at least

604
00:34:22,310 --> 00:34:26,199
directly speaking we r litigating this
issue and are looking for

605
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:29,200
you know other ways to do so so that's
that's you know

606
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:32,970
you get by supporting effector helping
in that fight on

607
00:34:32,970 --> 00:34:37,379
there are two you know at least as far
as I know legislative proposals

608
00:34:37,379 --> 00:34:41,168
that are pending that would require
search warrants for the police to get

609
00:34:41,168 --> 00:34:43,158
location data the first is the GPS

610
00:34:43,159 --> 00:34:46,909
act this is a bill introduced in
congress

611
00:34:46,909 --> 00:34:50,780
our last year but its it's taken a
little bit i'm for it

612
00:34:50,780 --> 00:34:54,260
I'm work its way through its a
bipartisan bill

613
00:34:54,260 --> 00:34:57,650
and so it in the house version was
introduced by

614
00:34:57,650 --> 00:35:00,910
republican check chafetz from Utah

615
00:35:00,910 --> 00:35:04,348
the Senate version was introduced by
Senator Wyden from organ

616
00:35:04,349 --> 00:35:06,849
so this bill would require law
enforcement to get a search warrant

617
00:35:06,849 --> 00:35:08,290
before using

618
00:35:08,290 --> 00:35:12,300
before obtaining basically any location
type data in California

619
00:35:12,300 --> 00:35:16,300
there's a location privacy act that the
effect in the cell you have sponsored

620
00:35:16,300 --> 00:35:17,170
together

621
00:35:17,170 --> 00:35:21,099
that would also require law enforcement
get a search warrant before accessing

622
00:35:21,099 --> 00:35:25,579
location data including both GPS and
cell site location data

623
00:35:25,579 --> 00:35:29,329
a understandably they've met with a lot
of law enforcement

624
00:35:29,329 --> 00:35:32,500
resistance not to mention even some
resistance from

625
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:36,000
wireless providers at least in
California example

626
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:39,630
in the california bill there was
initially I'm some stringent reporting

627
00:35:39,630 --> 00:35:43,260
requirements that would hopefully create
more transparency

628
00:35:43,260 --> 00:35:46,260
so we don't have to have congressman
writing letters to

629
00:35:46,260 --> 00:35:49,240
cell phone providers to figure out what
they were doing and how much

630
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:52,230
recordkeeping and turning over to the
government they were doing

631
00:35:52,230 --> 00:35:55,300
I'm but they were able you know able to
login get that

632
00:35:55,300 --> 00:35:59,430
taken out at the bill you know so there
is some you know resistance to these

633
00:35:59,430 --> 00:36:00,828
types of ideas but

634
00:36:00,829 --> 00:36:04,329
you know you all can get involved by
reading your representative for

635
00:36:04,329 --> 00:36:06,359
expressing your support for these two

636
00:36:06,359 --> 00:36:11,220
types of legislative proposals

637
00:36:11,220 --> 00:36:14,460
you can also protect yourself and I'm
gonna point you too

638
00:36:14,460 --> 00:36:17,520
my colleague marcia hot man who
yesterday gave a presentation on

639
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:19,079
protecting your data from the cops

640
00:36:19,079 --> 00:36:22,430
you should do everything she tells you
to do she's very smart and she's got

641
00:36:22,430 --> 00:36:24,060
your best interest that mind

642
00:36:24,060 --> 00:36:28,490
and i also up there's a blog post by
whenever activists Eva galperin who

643
00:36:28,490 --> 00:36:28,980
wrote

644
00:36:28,980 --> 00:36:33,640
guide about a cell phone died for Occupy
Wall Street protesters and also

645
00:36:33,640 --> 00:36:34,980
everybody else

646
00:36:34,980 --> 00:36:38,089
about how you can protect yourself and
protect your data

647
00:36:38,089 --> 00:36:41,960
but there's one other thing I wanna talk
about in a min and on this and then take

648
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:42,760
questions

649
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:46,480
and that's about technological measures

650
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:50,040
and I think this goes under reported

651
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:53,710
are I think there's not enough emphasis
placed on this

652
00:36:53,710 --> 00:36:57,380
at least by you know people like myself
who I i talked about this

653
00:36:57,380 --> 00:37:01,410
issue before and I've never really
talked about it in terms are looking at

654
00:37:01,410 --> 00:37:02,348
the technology

655
00:37:02,349 --> 00:37:05,970
like I said before you know we have to
be

656
00:37:05,970 --> 00:37:10,630
encouraging up technologies that only
store limited amounts of data and only

657
00:37:10,630 --> 00:37:13,780
keep that data for as long as necessary

658
00:37:13,780 --> 00:37:18,310
and I put up here to you know examples
have different ways

659
00:37:18,310 --> 00:37:21,560
by which companies and you know
technology

660
00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:24,640
actors so to speak can take steps to
limit

661
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:28,500
what they do am NOT here to endorse
either proposal just pointing them out

662
00:37:28,500 --> 00:37:30,750
there to say you know these are examples

663
00:37:30,750 --> 00:37:34,040
a things that the tech community needs
to talk about

664
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:37,609
but a start by noting that in March of
2012

665
00:37:37,609 --> 00:37:41,828
an FTC report said that company should
incorporate substantive privacy

666
00:37:41,829 --> 00:37:43,930
protections into their practices

667
00:37:43,930 --> 00:37:47,200
such as data security reasonable
collection limits sound retention

668
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:50,810
practices and data accuracy now
unfortunately the FTC didn't bother to

669
00:37:50,810 --> 00:37:51,660
define

670
00:37:51,660 --> 00:37:54,980
when any of those things mean in and
maybe for better or for worse that's

671
00:37:54,980 --> 00:37:58,109
that's not necessarily a bad thing that
they didn't define it I mean

672
00:37:58,109 --> 00:38:01,790
we can have the debate over whether we
want the FTC explaining what

673
00:38:01,790 --> 00:38:04,310
should and shouldn't be done on the
Internet and we can have that

674
00:38:04,310 --> 00:38:06,040
conversation later but

675
00:38:06,040 --> 00:38:10,599
you know both privacy by design privacy
engineering our ideas and say look

676
00:38:10,599 --> 00:38:14,359
when technologies are being built from
the ground up there needs to be

677
00:38:14,359 --> 00:38:17,859
privacy protections embedded in them
from the very beginning whether that's

678
00:38:17,859 --> 00:38:19,299
done through

679
00:38:19,300 --> 00:38:24,140
a.m. you know just thinking about them
and you know incorporating than in

680
00:38:24,140 --> 00:38:27,200
you know the way you know a a particular

681
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:31,270
ap E you would have the permission a
napkin

682
00:38:31,270 --> 00:38:34,540
is is given or whether it's done by
engineering and

683
00:38:34,540 --> 00:38:38,210
in making limit saying our company is
gonna agree running gonna keep data for

684
00:38:38,210 --> 00:38:41,810
10 days 30 days whatever it may be these
are some sound

685
00:38:41,810 --> 00:38:45,328
you know ideas the technologist need to
think about in order to protect

686
00:38:45,329 --> 00:38:49,410
my privacy because in some sense for
those of you out there who work for

687
00:38:49,410 --> 00:38:51,149
companies to store data

688
00:38:51,150 --> 00:38:54,980
my again my privacy rights are in your
hands

689
00:38:54,980 --> 00:39:00,339
so we need your help in insuring that as
technology is being developed privacy

690
00:39:00,339 --> 00:39:02,799
protections are embedded in them from
the very

691
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:07,270
very beginning okay so now this is the
time for questions if you have questions

692
00:39:07,270 --> 00:39:09,920
feel free to come on up there's a
microphone right there I'm gonna try to

693
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:10,410
get

694
00:39:10,410 --> 00:39:13,520
to as many questions I have time for
we've got about

695
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:16,810
think little under 20 minutes 0 you know
hopefully

696
00:39:16,810 --> 00:39:23,810
some questions will come up and while
people line up to make it more

697
00:39:36,130 --> 00:39:37,820
is so I'm curious

698
00:39:37,820 --> 00:39:41,410
given serve parameters for the limited
parameters

699
00:39:41,410 --> 00:39:44,890
law enforcement that you're talking
about I'm curious where

700
00:39:44,890 --> 00:39:46,830
or water protections are

701
00:39:46,830 --> 00:39:50,310
her legally where the NSA is concerned
in like

702
00:39:50,310 --> 00:39:53,490
that level is executive oversight were

703
00:39:53,490 --> 00:39:58,510
insight so bath that's kinda at
different issue

704
00:39:58,510 --> 00:40:02,310
arm and a

705
00:40:02,310 --> 00:40:05,860
by Sir is a whole completely different

706
00:40:05,860 --> 00:40:09,330
animal that I'm not gon talk about any
detail today but

707
00:40:09,330 --> 00:40:14,259
I'm what I will say is that allotted the
privacy protections i'm talking about.

708
00:40:14,260 --> 00:40:14,800
are

709
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:18,310
unfortunately reduced when we start to
bring in

710
00:40:18,310 --> 00:40:21,970
national security or safety word okay
and

711
00:40:21,970 --> 00:40:25,360
on there have been attempts to Ameen
Faisal

712
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:30,910
to bring it back more in line with
traditional Fourth Amendment protections

713
00:40:30,910 --> 00:40:32,629
unfortunately they haven't really

714
00:40:32,630 --> 00:40:37,450
gone anywhere on because there's a lot
of political pressure to be

715
00:40:37,450 --> 00:40:40,810
tough on national security threats but
um

716
00:40:40,810 --> 00:40:44,340
there's not as much is definitely not as
much transparency and there's definitely

717
00:40:44,340 --> 00:40:45,280
not as much

718
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:49,960
privacy protection that we have in those
situations and again their allotted

719
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:53,450
kinda nitty-gritty particulars we could
get into it at another point but all I

720
00:40:53,450 --> 00:40:54,450
would say is

721
00:40:54,450 --> 00:40:59,470
they're not as strong as they are when
we're talking about kinda like domestic

722
00:40:59,470 --> 00:41:05,530
Fourth Amendment issues and related
concerns super presentation a tank's

723
00:41:05,530 --> 00:41:08,530
I'm cell phone spyware I

724
00:41:08,530 --> 00:41:12,130
allows a third party to track your
movements

725
00:41:12,130 --> 00:41:15,900
astonishing precision I can turn on the
microphones

726
00:41:15,900 --> 00:41:19,150
your cell phone and listen to room
conversations I hope everybody

727
00:41:19,150 --> 00:41:22,560
if you're not familiar with I'm dangers
of cell phone spyware

728
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:26,279
released Google it when you're finished
with this presentation as well as

729
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:30,650
I listen to all your telephone
conversations and we all your text now

730
00:41:30,650 --> 00:41:36,180
text messages in email aren't these
technologies even more insidious and

731
00:41:36,180 --> 00:41:37,100
dangerous

732
00:41:37,100 --> 00:41:41,240
because they don't require going to
Twitter or third-party

733
00:41:41,240 --> 00:41:44,750
and how do we protect ourselves against
the dangers

734
00:41:44,750 --> 00:41:48,750
up cell phone spyware being used by the
government understand the FBI

735
00:41:48,750 --> 00:41:51,890
has used in the past I with the number
crew

736
00:41:51,890 --> 00:41:55,779
criminal investigations so thank you for
the question

737
00:41:55,780 --> 00:41:59,270
hell yeah that stuff is really crazy and

738
00:41:59,270 --> 00:42:02,840
you know I think there's like the
practical

739
00:42:02,840 --> 00:42:05,960
things you can do you know like you know

740
00:42:05,960 --> 00:42:10,030
be careful who you know again this is a
very technical audience I i think a lot

741
00:42:10,030 --> 00:42:11,890
of these things are gonna sound really
obvious

742
00:42:11,890 --> 00:42:15,589
arm you know you be careful who you down
aP's from you be careful

743
00:42:15,590 --> 00:42:19,310
you get to be careful with what website
you visit on yourself I think those

744
00:42:19,310 --> 00:42:20,779
things are pretty common sense

745
00:42:20,780 --> 00:42:24,150
but in terms of like the government's
use this technology

746
00:42:24,150 --> 00:42:27,760
we are starting to see this more often
like for example like stingray which is

747
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:28,080
like a

748
00:42:28,080 --> 00:42:31,509
fake cellphone tower and that raises a
whole host the

749
00:42:31,510 --> 00:42:35,380
a different issues they're less about
and these when the government's using

750
00:42:35,380 --> 00:42:39,720
technologies like the Stingray for
example they don't bring up this early

751
00:42:39,720 --> 00:42:40,640
that third-party

752
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:44,009
doctrine issue which in in a way is
actually

753
00:42:44,010 --> 00:42:50,200
better because you know the third party
doctrine is an obstacle we're trying to

754
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:50,910
overcome

755
00:42:50,910 --> 00:42:54,040
so if the government is the one doing it
directly in some sense you've got a

756
00:42:54,040 --> 00:42:57,340
stronger Fourth Amendment claim that
that doesn't mean I i want them to

757
00:42:57,340 --> 00:43:01,190
do it more often so I can have better
for them argument but again

758
00:43:01,190 --> 00:43:05,170
I think it's something that as
technology advances and as we turn

759
00:43:05,170 --> 00:43:07,770
before these examples become here doubt
we need to

760
00:43:07,770 --> 00:43:11,600
as a community you know stand up
together whether that's through the

761
00:43:11,600 --> 00:43:12,390
legal process

762
00:43:12,390 --> 00:43:15,859
in bringing legal challenges and having
people willing to you know

763
00:43:15,860 --> 00:43:19,030
fight for this type of privacy whether
it's through the company's standing up

764
00:43:19,030 --> 00:43:20,610
for the users the way that winter day

765
00:43:20,610 --> 00:43:24,980
and whether it's through technologists
who are able to develop technologies

766
00:43:24,980 --> 00:43:25,600
that are both

767
00:43:25,600 --> 00:43:29,160
you know privacy protected but also that
are

768
00:43:29,160 --> 00:43:33,240
you know able to combat somebody's
privacy site

769
00:43:33,240 --> 00:43:36,200
feel it in the legal side I know just
enough to feel really stupid about

770
00:43:36,200 --> 00:43:37,570
things like and it's only 10

771
00:43:37,570 --> 00:43:40,960
arm but from a technical side I have to
ask this

772
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:43,990
these subpoenas have to at some point B
file

773
00:43:43,990 --> 00:43:47,780
right with the court something in the
range in it was going to pacer it would

774
00:43:47,780 --> 00:43:48,500
go into

775
00:43:48,500 --> 00:43:51,520
a system somewhere that would be
publicly accessible because the public

776
00:43:51,520 --> 00:43:52,370
court records

777
00:43:52,370 --> 00:43:55,529
would it be possible for the FF to radis

778
00:43:55,530 --> 00:43:59,810
grip a website at all that looks for
these that rolls for these and

779
00:43:59,810 --> 00:44:00,520
automatically

780
00:44:00,520 --> 00:44:04,650
files the challenge already don't have
standing to do that I am

781
00:44:04,650 --> 00:44:07,950
in good question understanding is that
we gonna be an issue

782
00:44:07,950 --> 00:44:13,320
because we can just file blank lawsuits
and say we are challenging every

783
00:44:13,320 --> 00:44:16,700
particular subpoena that we don't agree
with we have to have a client

784
00:44:16,700 --> 00:44:20,050
and an individual who is harmed by it ok

785
00:44:20,050 --> 00:44:23,100
more generally speaking though I think
it's important to distinguish between a

786
00:44:23,100 --> 00:44:27,010
subpoena search warrant the subpoenas
are not necessarily placed on pacer

787
00:44:27,010 --> 00:44:30,130
on the public docket and oftentimes they
come in

788
00:44:30,130 --> 00:44:34,430
under seal search warrants our little
bit different and they eventually will

789
00:44:34,430 --> 00:44:35,500
make it onto

790
00:44:35,500 --> 00:44:40,070
pacer if a criminal cases filed
oftentimes will remain

791
00:44:40,070 --> 00:44:43,730
seal instill the problem is it

792
00:44:43,730 --> 00:44:47,960
almost easier to get access to the
search warrants that it

793
00:44:47,960 --> 00:44:51,110
is to get access the subpoenas
oftentimes

794
00:44:51,110 --> 00:44:55,130
I'm particularly because a lot of the
stuff like but he can't even see them as

795
00:44:55,130 --> 00:44:56,110
an example

796
00:44:56,110 --> 00:44:59,270
you nor any large ISP your cell phone
company

797
00:44:59,270 --> 00:45:02,540
the they're going to have a hold the
apartment whose job it is

798
00:45:02,540 --> 00:45:06,470
is to process the subpoenas and unless
there's somebody like

799
00:45:06,470 --> 00:45:09,940
you know Google issue the transparency
report that tells us

800
00:45:09,940 --> 00:45:14,490
we got X number subpoenas on in this
particular year we just

801
00:45:14,490 --> 00:45:18,370
don't know how many requests are getting
what they're request r4

802
00:45:18,370 --> 00:45:21,940
we just have to kind of take their word
that they're complying law

803
00:45:21,940 --> 00:45:25,420
so it there are obstacles in our
difficulties but

804
00:45:25,420 --> 00:45:28,740
mean I would definitely welcome anyone
who wants to

805
00:45:28,740 --> 00:45:32,660
find a way to you know bring you know
bring

806
00:45:32,660 --> 00:45:35,920
subpoenas search warrants that seem
questionable to us and we can examine

807
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:36,700
them in

808
00:45:36,700 --> 00:45:40,060
you know use that as a way to develop
legal strategy here

809
00:45:40,060 --> 00:45:43,270
technical strategies to combat these
problems

810
00:45:43,270 --> 00:45:47,020
just 11 quick from follow-up to the this
question

811
00:45:47,020 --> 00:45:50,480
think we need to make a distinction
between a subpoena

812
00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:53,790
which is not controlled by anybody
except for that agency

813
00:45:53,790 --> 00:45:57,980
and a warrant which is judicial control
over the agency the service to

814
00:45:57,980 --> 00:46:01,210
absolutely absolutely in just a quick
before and I'll let you get your

815
00:46:01,210 --> 00:46:02,240
question you know

816
00:46:02,240 --> 00:46:05,760
subpoenaed is in this the subpoena
stamped by the clerk at the court

817
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:10,870
site it's not stand by judge there's no
judicial oversight in a subpoena at all

818
00:46:10,870 --> 00:46:15,049
search warrant with in this is why we
want search warrants

819
00:46:15,050 --> 00:46:18,820
the judge has to approve it the judge
can set limits you know like in Jones

820
00:46:18,820 --> 00:46:19,520
for example the

821
00:46:19,520 --> 00:46:23,509
the Jets a 10-day that's what you get an
and after the search warrant

822
00:46:23,510 --> 00:46:28,110
is executed they have to in a law
enforcement has to return to the judge

823
00:46:28,110 --> 00:46:31,830
with an inventory this is what we took
and

824
00:46:31,830 --> 00:46:35,009
it's an open legal question how much
limit drawing

825
00:46:35,010 --> 00:46:39,180
a the judges can do but there's at least
some procedural protections there that

826
00:46:39,180 --> 00:46:39,430
are

827
00:46:39,430 --> 00:46:42,750
that otherwise absent recipients any
disaster I

828
00:46:42,750 --> 00:46:47,540
in the battle love on no trying to
secure rights for third party

829
00:46:47,540 --> 00:46:50,860
%uh on rights or were

830
00:46:50,860 --> 00:46:54,620
an individual can happen retain his
rights through a third party

831
00:46:54,620 --> 00:46:57,859
I'll have has legal profession look to

832
00:46:57,860 --> 00:47:01,840
analogous situations one comes right
after mine to me if I have a safety

833
00:47:01,840 --> 00:47:03,680
deposit box in a bank

834
00:47:03,680 --> 00:47:07,419
I have that right to keep that thing
private in there

835
00:47:07,420 --> 00:47:10,860
but safe tomorrow there's a technology
that can X-ray

836
00:47:10,860 --> 00:47:14,140
and they can look into the contents of
that box

837
00:47:14,140 --> 00:47:18,770
and the Olson not only that but they can
look in the computer and match up whose

838
00:47:18,770 --> 00:47:20,020
box that is

839
00:47:20,020 --> 00:47:23,210
and they know what person has

840
00:47:23,210 --> 00:47:27,210
what and anise assert marzo I think a
safety behind it

841
00:47:27,210 --> 00:47:31,200
box has been traditionally viewed as a a
private item in that

842
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:34,230
government can't go in there are less if
they actually have the search

843
00:47:34,230 --> 00:47:38,080
warrant they can subpoena whatcha is in
my box o

844
00:47:38,080 --> 00:47:42,819
have you guys looked to an analogous
situations to present

845
00:47:42,820 --> 00:47:46,350
good a arguments there this

846
00:47:46,350 --> 00:47:50,810
there is one case that is very similar
to the situation it's called

847
00:47:50,810 --> 00:47:54,000
United States versus were shack this was
a case that

848
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:57,610
look at what privacy protection under
the fourth amendment

849
00:47:57,610 --> 00:48:01,240
under the fourth amendment have for
email and

850
00:48:01,240 --> 00:48:05,110
email has a long tortured history

851
00:48:05,110 --> 00:48:08,310
under exper in up in a

852
00:48:08,310 --> 00:48:11,860
in a nutshell just so it's clear expert
says

853
00:48:11,860 --> 00:48:15,520
email that is stored in your inbox for

854
00:48:15,520 --> 00:48:19,050
less than 180 days requires a search
warrant

855
00:48:19,050 --> 00:48:22,770
and email that stored for more than 180
days does not

856
00:48:22,770 --> 00:48:25,920
okay weekend again I could have a whole

857
00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:29,540
two-hour lecture about do you agree with
that not a lot not

858
00:48:29,540 --> 00:48:35,480
right race never a anything I i did i
win or for the effort

859
00:48:35,480 --> 00:48:39,550
at be thrown out at anyway in in wash
Act the court looked at that and said

860
00:48:39,550 --> 00:48:40,210
hey

861
00:48:40,210 --> 00:48:44,060
well the court found look despite

862
00:48:44,060 --> 00:48:47,279
what expert says people do you maintain

863
00:48:47,280 --> 00:48:50,810
reasonable expectation of privacy in
there email because

864
00:48:50,810 --> 00:48:54,890
you even though let's see if the Gmail
or Yahoo Mail whatever

865
00:48:54,890 --> 00:48:59,020
even though technically speaking you
know Google is holding your

866
00:48:59,020 --> 00:49:03,330
email you don't expect them to just open
it in read through your email hopefully

867
00:49:03,330 --> 00:49:06,370
and it's the same in and therefore

868
00:49:06,370 --> 00:49:09,690
you know the court found the Fourth
Amendment protects that

869
00:49:09,690 --> 00:49:14,570
so you know reviews that case in trying
argue the cell site location data

870
00:49:14,570 --> 00:49:18,730
argument in courts the courts that are

871
00:49:18,730 --> 00:49:22,310
you know that had held that's all set
location data is protected under the

872
00:49:22,310 --> 00:49:23,920
Fourth Amendment requires a search
warrant

873
00:49:23,920 --> 00:49:27,730
have certainly look in turn to worship
and a quarter said

874
00:49:27,730 --> 00:49:31,470
no you know we don't think so said
location data requires a search warrant

875
00:49:31,470 --> 00:49:34,930
they distinguished were checked by
saying there's a big difference between

876
00:49:34,930 --> 00:49:38,609
email which anyone would generally
recognized is

877
00:49:38,610 --> 00:49:41,820
is private and belongs to you even
though it's held by

878
00:49:41,820 --> 00:49:46,030
Google or Yahoo or whatever and cell
site location data which when you really

879
00:49:46,030 --> 00:49:48,170
think about it this is what the courts
have said

880
00:49:48,170 --> 00:49:51,180
me think about it is the companies
record

881
00:49:51,180 --> 00:49:55,609
the company is the one who owns and
maintains in creates in keep that record

882
00:49:55,610 --> 00:49:59,930
I don't agree with that but that is what
the courts help

883
00:49:59,930 --> 00:50:04,440
one quibble think it's funny how free
speech all son becomes the record the

884
00:50:04,440 --> 00:50:06,270
company's

885
00:50:06,270 --> 00:50:10,360
that again that's a that's a whole whole
other can of worms there

886
00:50:10,360 --> 00:50:13,370
I had a question about the third party
data I'm

887
00:50:13,370 --> 00:50:16,690
in told that it doesn't make much
difference with your data is in another

888
00:50:16,690 --> 00:50:17,720
country or

889
00:50:17,720 --> 00:50:22,880
particularly canada or europe on the US
law enforcement as a wave

890
00:50:22,880 --> 00:50:27,050
going in accessing in cooperating with
law enforcement in other countries

891
00:50:27,050 --> 00:50:30,980
rose if you could comment on that
particular you know I slid his pass laws

892
00:50:30,980 --> 00:50:34,940
that are more protective if there's any
legal or practical experiences you've

893
00:50:34,940 --> 00:50:36,050
had with

894
00:50:36,050 --> 00:50:40,400
US law enforcement going after data
third-party data that it's either stored

895
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:43,700
it in a server or in a company based in
another country

896
00:50:43,700 --> 00:50:47,010
so I have to confess that I'm not all
that well versed

897
00:50:47,010 --> 00:50:51,110
on the contours a international access
to it

898
00:50:51,110 --> 00:50:55,920
what I will say is that depending on the
country oftentimes

899
00:50:55,920 --> 00:51:00,100
the procedure many international
countries but they basically said is

900
00:51:00,100 --> 00:51:00,480
look

901
00:51:00,480 --> 00:51:05,600
if the process is is valid under
American law and you meet Sir n

902
00:51:05,600 --> 00:51:09,920
additional requirements required by you
know under English marketing or whatever

903
00:51:09,920 --> 00:51:13,830
generally it's going to be turned over
but anything more specific than that I

904
00:51:13,830 --> 00:51:17,590
just honestly I don't know what I
wouldn't feel like a plan sir Antony

905
00:51:17,590 --> 00:51:20,690
30 last question a rape

906
00:51:20,690 --> 00:51:23,790
I read the case and now

907
00:51:23,790 --> 00:51:28,700
is which one that jones' case and just
to get a rape

908
00:51:28,700 --> 00:51:32,810
the guys investigators rate they did the
right thing to get there were in

909
00:51:32,810 --> 00:51:36,720
down but the he was for one state and
they actually did it in a different

910
00:51:36,720 --> 00:51:37,250
state

911
00:51:37,250 --> 00:51:40,310
bang yeah and also it was for 10 days
admitted

912
00:51:40,310 --> 00:51:43,360
after 10 days yes so this is

913
00:51:43,360 --> 00:51:46,680
bad procedure absolutely and

914
00:51:46,680 --> 00:51:50,040
just because that we're asking all these
questions and also I agree with you that

915
00:51:50,040 --> 00:51:51,630
Sotomayor's opinions

916
00:51:51,630 --> 00:51:55,310
about what at how different it is now
with the allege

917
00:51:55,310 --> 00:51:58,560
I'm it's a right way to actually look at
it

918
00:51:58,560 --> 00:52:02,049
its yeah I think I think the point is
and a lot of his ass

919
00:52:02,050 --> 00:52:05,150
have all the cases for the government to
take up to the supreme court this was

920
00:52:05,150 --> 00:52:05,580
the

921
00:52:05,580 --> 00:52:09,350
absolute worst one but thankfully we got
a pretty good opinion at it so we should

922
00:52:09,350 --> 00:52:11,150
thank them for that too so anyway

923
00:52:11,150 --> 00:52:12,750
that's all the time I have court thinks
consumers
