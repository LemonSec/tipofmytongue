and what a horrible horrible

19
00:01:03,649 --> 00:01:06,939
fantastic ideas arm so

20
00:01:06,939 --> 00:01:11,130
whom I am I'm far I'm from Philly arm I
currently work in New York

21
00:01:11,130 --> 00:01:14,298
I've been in the hackerspace scene for
about four years

22
00:01:14,299 --> 00:01:19,210
a hope four years ago was when I really
gotta have spacing on really got into

23
00:01:19,210 --> 00:01:22,759
nom you noticed to around a building
stuff arm

24
00:01:22,759 --> 00:01:26,830
I cofounder a couple hackerspace as I
was involved in getting both the hive in

25
00:01:26,830 --> 00:01:28,289
the hacker certain Philadelphia

26
00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:31,909
on my children have given talks a
various schools and universities and

27
00:01:31,909 --> 00:01:32,869
nonprofits about

28
00:01:32,869 --> 00:01:36,479
how to start a hackerspace what the
hacker scene is why

29
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:40,700
it kinda has to be great how you can
really say 00 related people clothing

30
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:44,189
technology they want and then say oh no
only these technologies are allowed and

31
00:01:44,189 --> 00:01:45,549
that you can go on say

32
00:01:45,549 --> 00:01:48,939
all we want people to invent new cool
stuff but has to make money next year

33
00:01:48,939 --> 00:01:53,329
in only really trying to get them to
understand that research education

34
00:01:53,329 --> 00:01:56,899
breaking things turned his part doesn't
always happen to me return like some

35
00:01:56,899 --> 00:01:58,799
time to take some time to mess around
with

36
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:02,329
I'm anything that ties in with with how
3d printing in

37
00:02:02,329 --> 00:02:05,780
in you manufacturing in d like ratios

38
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:09,750
from and involved in a couple other
nonprofit stuff like that

39
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:14,030
so you know that's all what I do for fun
for my day job I'm actually

40
00:02:14,030 --> 00:02:17,470
dinner her and make her mine industries
and that means I sit around and watch

41
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:19,709
really awesome developers wrongly billed
cool stuff

42
00:02:19,709 --> 00:02:22,770
and I try to keep everybody on our way a
tricky you know

43
00:02:22,770 --> 00:02:25,849
management from getting in their way I
treaty other companies from getting in

44
00:02:25,849 --> 00:02:26,810
their way I try to keep

45
00:02:26,810 --> 00:02:30,450
unknowing details down to a minimum so
they can sit there and build the cost of

46
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:31,010
possible

47
00:02:31,010 --> 00:02:34,120
are in this talk also is entirely just
me

48
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:38,080
its my rants my crazy ideas make about
is not responsible office

49
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:42,480
if I insult your drive you crazy the
come find me at a conference center for

50
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:42,988
me.

51
00:02:42,989 --> 00:02:46,519
on but you know this is all my personal
point of view

52
00:02:46,519 --> 00:02:49,200
I'm awesome things a friend that only
have a bias you know I want to make

53
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:49,560
about

54
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:53,590
I really like what they do I love the
three free be in general but I can be

55
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:56,650
opinion it so I may say things that are
annoying are wrong

56
00:02:56,650 --> 00:02:59,980
any come up a Tony you i'm wrong. crack
me so

57
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:03,190
Palm Beach that's all for that so

58
00:03:03,190 --> 00:03:05,599
I'm rethinking as in a time warp rate
one of the things i think is so

59
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:07,110
difficult talking a technology

60
00:03:07,110 --> 00:03:10,349
is how much we assume in how quickly we
assume

61
00:03:10,349 --> 00:03:13,550
arm so I think part was inching about

62
00:03:13,550 --> 00:03:17,069
the Delta between four years ago on this
year is a lot of what happened

63
00:03:17,069 --> 00:03:20,769
so I actually like you guys to take a
second clear head you're in this room

64
00:03:20,769 --> 00:03:23,840
you may have been your committee were in
this room for years ago raise your hand

65
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:28,330
call I mean he learns from two years ago
awesome fantastic

66
00:03:28,330 --> 00:03:31,810
so I'll let's go back in time rate it's
not

67
00:03:31,810 --> 00:03:35,930
2012 anymore is 2008 rates the last hope
like this this is

68
00:03:35,930 --> 00:03:40,099
you know let's actually do even anymore
gonna its 2008 Obama's even present yet

69
00:03:40,099 --> 00:03:40,470
rate

70
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:45,140
Bush as president the economic the
economic class hasn't happened yet Lake

71
00:03:45,140 --> 00:03:48,269
all the banks are fine everything all
housing market it's just gonna keep

72
00:03:48,269 --> 00:03:49,819
going up and up and up forever

73
00:03:49,819 --> 00:03:52,819
arm yeah what else is going on

74
00:03:52,819 --> 00:03:56,019
a I'll large Korean climber was just
test-fired right

75
00:03:56,019 --> 00:03:59,390
almost visitor trends like guys this
thing there and find stuff with it

76
00:03:59,390 --> 00:04:02,590
and they have now but in the past it was
a really cool

77
00:04:02,590 --> 00:04:06,659
arm and it was the year the pair Seagate
Momentus stuff 2008 all the pair

78
00:04:06,659 --> 00:04:07,310
hijackings

79
00:04:07,310 --> 00:04:11,629
anybody Yes No anything Lake all over
the Middle East fire hijacking every

80
00:04:11,629 --> 00:04:12,030

81
00:04:12,030 --> 00:04:15,970
Air Force was parents for Halloween

82
00:04:15,970 --> 00:04:19,100
yes I anything else anybody in the
audience what else happened in 2008

83
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:22,310
anybody dealer

84
00:04:22,310 --> 00:04:25,500
the okay whatever alright so

85
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:29,060
arm so let's get a hope in 2008 rate
hoping he doesn't it was actually pretty

86
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:30,100
different affair

87
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:33,630
are it was the last hope they're gonna
cancel this thing we were done they

88
00:04:33,630 --> 00:04:34,979
return on this hotel

89
00:04:34,979 --> 00:04:39,469
during like you know all common cry when
they tore down in like simply comments

90
00:04:39,470 --> 00:04:41,500
last place before told a conference in
New York

91
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:44,860
arm are flaky badges were in

92
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:48,889
Lake like their out this year but they
were totally it was like are

93
00:04:48,889 --> 00:04:52,110
lil tombstone badges are off by the
weekend like track you and stuff

94
00:04:52,110 --> 00:04:57,020
in things so if those cool on Acuna
bodies were like the fresh new thing

95
00:04:57,020 --> 00:05:01,909
is like what I was 10 by or something
are mad and sad to give the keynote

96
00:05:01,910 --> 00:05:05,620
rate so Adam Savage's like all these
laws will stop and here's the dodo bird

97
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:06,600
adult stuff like that

98
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:09,990
like use a different place hackerspace
is we're just getting started I was the

99
00:05:09,990 --> 00:05:11,470
for sure they had like the hackerspace

100
00:05:11,470 --> 00:05:14,889
panel we had people come up in Nick
forgave his famously

101
00:05:14,889 --> 00:05:18,139
your excuses are invalid talk on which
is still true

102
00:05:18,139 --> 00:05:22,120
but its historic moment so you know

103
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:25,000
that's that's the world we were in and
it's really hard at something sometimes

104
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,160
I think back because

105
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:29,660
we because technology is so fast were
forced to move with it

106
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:32,729
and sometimes put yourself back metal
head space is hard

107
00:05:32,729 --> 00:05:37,320
arm so 2008 one of the big news items a
2008 the ties into both

108
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:40,990
the general world and the hacker
community was the rap rap you know

109
00:05:40,990 --> 00:05:45,610
the machine that copies itself um and
this came out a few months before hope

110
00:05:45,610 --> 00:05:46,190
and I was

111
00:05:46,190 --> 00:05:49,240
you know it in attackers base in Philly
were talking early hey this is really

112
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:50,139
cool

113
00:05:50,139 --> 00:05:54,850
and we happen to get arm off at home via
Cornell and Evan Malone

114
00:05:54,850 --> 00:05:57,949
and you know we have one set up at the
hatchery in philadelphia and we're

115
00:05:57,949 --> 00:06:00,550
playing with it was a call you you
really need to talk about this you

116
00:06:00,550 --> 00:06:02,440
really need to bring suit conference
really need a

117
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:05,469
to bring what's going on arm and

118
00:06:05,470 --> 00:06:08,750
you know so that's how I ended up
getting ripped into this arm

119
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:12,509
but I'll this article's condition it's
like but doctor aging power doesn't look

120
00:06:12,509 --> 00:06:13,819
like an evil mastermind

121
00:06:13,819 --> 00:06:18,800
that they don't they never do arm Poggi
twinkly I 55-year-old senior

122
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:22,750
and I certainly get that actually
doesn't look evil mastermind arm

123
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:25,780
and you know it was demoted the shot
them Science Festival

124
00:06:25,780 --> 00:06:29,750
an early 2008 so arm

125
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:33,199
so I ended up because %uh that because
it was big news because we happen to

126
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:33,580
have a

127
00:06:33,580 --> 00:06:37,289
I am donated arm I got a volunteered

129
00:06:41,550 --> 00:06:44,800
the DIY seen and

130
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:47,930
what was going on with you know
hackerspace is

131
00:06:47,930 --> 00:06:51,560
Fab Lab School gym stuff like that on
you sign it together with

132
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:54,660
the whole manufacturing is going on and
i cant you know

133
00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:58,660
Rep rap was just announced laser cutters
will be coming call on places like

134
00:06:58,660 --> 00:07:02,009
pulling money by laser cutters like the
founding object for budget

135
00:07:02,009 --> 00:07:06,340
actors bases was we're gonna for money
for this you know fabrication

136
00:07:06,340 --> 00:07:10,449
arm and I gave a talk to basis
tight-knit like can wear things were

137

and talk much sir leak the journal
school things all others like no

139
00:07:17,949 --> 00:07:20,770
I'm wanna say what the actual library
development where labor is turned out

140
00:07:20,770 --> 00:07:23,500
with different models from subscription
attack service

141
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:27,520
and image look into models there's that
fight out to see which model works best

142
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:28,500
for their community

143
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:31,550
I'm to keep his verses logs at the time
you know some people

144
00:07:31,550 --> 00:07:35,900
were and still are trying to open tool
jim's which is very different than your

148
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:47,849
passionate they're just trying to get
the access technology

149
00:07:47,849 --> 00:07:51,870
arm harbor will be as easy as software
was a big thing that was a big

150
00:07:51,870 --> 00:07:55,280
like there's a big discussion point in
2008 was lowering the bar hardware

151
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:58,569
honecker's are criminals all singing
popular party was asleep our guys to get

152
00:07:58,569 --> 00:07:59,479
this

153
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:03,349
don't worry about eighty argue anymore
it just click a button works

154
00:08:03,349 --> 00:08:07,180
on and I was you for some answers 3
brings new unseen

155
00:08:07,180 --> 00:08:10,090
you know there's currently a while it
rains all stuff we're still doing now

156
00:08:10,090 --> 00:08:11,280
but then it was a lot of pressure

157
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:14,750
i think thats again it's one of those
things where it's hard to hurdle back in

158
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:19,000
you have the context for so are so I'm
FS for 2012

159
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,349
hey you're here great given the future
arm

160
00:08:22,349 --> 00:08:25,440
t0 gray hot it's great um

161
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:28,750
cm three players are common rate you get
these things anywhere

162
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:32,049
hackerspace is a common if you how many
people have a hackerspace in driving

163
00:08:32,049 --> 00:08:33,809
distance

164
00:08:33,810 --> 00:08:37,370
how many people are member the
hackerspace I mean people founded a

165
00:08:37,370 --> 00:08:38,969
hackerspace

166
00:08:38,969 --> 00:08:42,370
look at this this is awesome this is
great so yet so I mean

167
00:08:42,370 --> 00:08:46,080
it's not only is this to come but we
made it that way this is all ours

168
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:49,890
like me built this stuff we design a
stuff we built this community

169
00:08:49,890 --> 00:08:54,140
we put ours and the hardware and we're
reaping the the reports from a

170
00:08:54,140 --> 00:08:58,939
arm yeah and the did ano the revolution
will be televised its asking me on

171
00:08:58,940 --> 00:08:59,490
twitter

172
00:08:59,490 --> 00:09:04,100
you can follow it at the revolution it's
really kind of my name but it's fun

173
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:07,589
you know like this are the steps getting
attention which is largely

174
00:09:07,589 --> 00:09:11,200
home see a you know this only happens
bases arm

175
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:15,220
you know Maker Faire the street in 2008
there were like to Maker Faires

176
00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:18,269
and now I think there's like five
official ones there's about

177
00:09:18,269 --> 00:09:22,850
15 unofficial nom your community ones

178
00:09:22,850 --> 00:09:27,100
arm the the Make Magazine and the DIY
seen as exploded you know Instructables

179
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:28,149
is no longer the

180
00:09:28,149 --> 00:09:31,440
the waistline people holding shares that
once was it now has a lot really awesome

181
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:32,100
in circles

182
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:36,910
high-quality arm I'll ask coming 123

183
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:39,790
3-pointer companies I could be wrong it
could be like double counting them

184
00:09:39,790 --> 00:09:41,130
because people keep buying each other

185
00:09:41,130 --> 00:09:43,950
and weird stuff but on and a lot of
those are star what others are based on

186
00:09:43,950 --> 00:09:44,589
Rep rap

187
00:09:44,589 --> 00:09:48,390
orders are based on various open source
designs arm

188
00:09:48,390 --> 00:09:52,199
there's Kickstarter Zanu companies
starting all the time

189
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:56,910
IndieGoGo Kickstarter some nasa has like
mean breaking his lot faster so

190
00:09:56,910 --> 00:10:00,100
we live in a much friendlier world for a
lot of these ideas arm

191
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:04,170
than we did a few years ago so us on the
books for saying on

192
00:10:04,170 --> 00:10:08,279
on the workspace what shifted since then
so 2008 tax bases just started

193
00:10:08,279 --> 00:10:11,860
tax bases panel there's five to eight
spaces I would say

194
00:10:11,860 --> 00:10:15,410
I you know is kinda hard to go through
and findings account arm I didn't check

195
00:10:15,410 --> 00:10:16,449
on her space that or

196
00:10:16,450 --> 00:10:19,579
there's over 200 hackerspace is now
looking at the map in the US

197
00:10:19,579 --> 00:10:23,490
like overlying hackerspace against
population almost everybody is within an

198
00:10:23,490 --> 00:10:24,769
hour's drive space

199
00:10:24,769 --> 00:10:27,870
like if you really want to make
something you can drive an hour find a

200
00:10:27,870 --> 00:10:28,860
bunch of friends

201
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:32,690
and say hey how I make this or go on
sale here making this too and help me

202
00:10:32,690 --> 00:10:36,149
arm fab labs have expanded slowly
nominate

203
00:10:36,149 --> 00:10:40,740
you know in 2008 I I could find
information about six to 10 fab labs and

204
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:42,230
i cant find fresh relic

205
00:10:42,230 --> 00:10:45,829
20 to 30 of them now publish them are
like tech shop where there is a course

206
00:10:45,829 --> 00:10:47,040
that live in their starting up

207
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:50,800
different versions alt where third world
is like this third word you know is

208
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:54,060
is moving in philadelphia onto that
spring slowly

209
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:57,310
upstart to Jim's on Sat letter
university owns

210
00:10:57,310 --> 00:11:01,019
I I had actually found problems finding
numbers on the number universal shops

211
00:11:01,019 --> 00:11:01,740
like that

212
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:06,050
so arm Community Knowledge talk about
this community love it

213
00:11:06,050 --> 00:11:10,660
yet so the ability to access the
militant go out and find information

214
00:11:10,660 --> 00:11:13,709
on even in the last four years radically
improved I

215
00:11:13,709 --> 00:11:16,800
was sort of the road trying to look up
some different scary things to see like

216
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:20,220
I wanted to build a small when I get
stuck on I spent some time

217
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:24,930
and you know four years ago saying hey I
want to fix this thing how a 3d printer

218
00:11:24,930 --> 00:11:25,709
model

219
00:11:25,709 --> 00:11:28,790
you would find like to schedule for
impose the same download

220
00:11:28,790 --> 00:11:32,399
this open Icecat software use it and now
they're just volumes at that

221
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:36,350
so the knowledge in the accessibility of
the stuff is is increasing every year

222
00:11:36,350 --> 00:11:39,690
and we're a much better position and
where few years ago arm

223
00:11:39,690 --> 00:11:43,040
3-pointers this is something you know
good about um

224
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:46,800
so 3-pointers and basically it come into
existence in the last four years

225
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:50,120
in four years ago rap rap had just hit

226
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:54,850
the news I was just you there are a
handful models every one to build one

227
00:11:54,850 --> 00:11:58,360
and now there's a plethora of 3-pointers

228
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:01,579
so I wanna go through a couple of
different service families a very visual

229
00:12:01,579 --> 00:12:04,200
pictures to give some folks who might
now an idea

230
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:08,079
I'll apologists gether arm

231
00:12:08,079 --> 00:12:11,149
soviet 2008 web rebels about the only
option

232
00:12:11,149 --> 00:12:14,339
on the instructions run a Wikia to going
into source everything in downloader all

233
00:12:14,339 --> 00:12:15,610
that yourself

234
00:12:15,610 --> 00:12:18,630
are and the model at that point was the
repre- Darwin

235
00:12:18,630 --> 00:12:22,399
and was you know had to cross streets is
actually end up in the bill on the

236
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:23,990
pieces were bit specialized

237
00:12:23,990 --> 00:12:26,480
and getting the mean rate was pretty
tough getting your samples was pretty

238
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:27,180
tough

239
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:32,019
arm 2000 the 2009 make about had the
cupcake CNC released

240
00:12:32,019 --> 00:12:36,220
and repre- mental also came out on in
both cases they were

241
00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:39,380
they were improving assembly in a
permanent functionality

242
00:12:39,380 --> 00:12:43,139
a lot on Easter had started to change
and become a lot more reliable

243
00:12:43,139 --> 00:12:46,220
a lot and so little tiny week knobs
budget

244
00:12:46,220 --> 00:12:50,040
p it's totally we don't do that anymore
or so much cooler

245
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:53,050
arm so 2010 think medicare male

246
00:12:53,050 --> 00:12:56,339
in same thing 2010 Hopley came out arm

247
00:12:56,339 --> 00:12:59,899
you know again both both lower the bar
built-in personal things are

248
00:12:59,899 --> 00:13:03,839
Huxley is you'll become a pretty popular
platform

249
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:07,450
arm 2012 me about replicators released
and

250
00:13:07,450 --> 00:13:10,200
also the printer but was released this
year and this is actually inching his

251
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:11,450
you see the

252
00:13:11,450 --> 00:13:15,019
you see did the industry going into two
fractions in the field of models

253
00:13:15,019 --> 00:13:18,649
diversifying because he's to be cookie
C&C

254
00:13:18,649 --> 00:13:21,850
repre- all these things had recently
someone build sizes of them has recently

255
00:13:21,850 --> 00:13:23,000
some more features

256
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,800
and they're kinda like spreading out a
little bit from that core design an

257
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:26,630
appalling

258
00:13:26,630 --> 00:13:30,399
and now that trio of evolution has has
grown a lot

259
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:33,889
near Prabhat over here really tiny you
ever get over here whose goals

260
00:13:33,889 --> 00:13:37,050
the high reliability and has all sorts
of awesome

261
00:13:37,050 --> 00:13:41,449
things everyone between and you know
also

262
00:13:41,449 --> 00:13:44,790
some movie companies are starting to you
push into this market on this year saw

263
00:13:44,790 --> 00:13:46,329
the release of the motel

264
00:13:46,329 --> 00:13:49,430
and a cube don't talk a lot about this
later but these are coming out in a

265
00:13:49,430 --> 00:13:50,980
traditional three-point accompanies

266
00:13:50,980 --> 00:13:54,420
that have the original pans from the
70's and 80's and you sat on them like a

267
00:13:54,420 --> 00:13:55,320
giant

268
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:59,760
a good money giant money eg in the
israeli cams 27 28

269
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:03,709
and you know now that they're smaller
3-pointer spring out around them

270
00:14:03,709 --> 00:14:06,670
they're looking back in trying to trying
to get another into the market that they

271
00:14:06,670 --> 00:14:10,070
see

272
00:14:10,070 --> 00:14:14,449
no I'm so lost call and there's new one
a new warrior has entered the ring

273
00:14:14,449 --> 00:14:17,490
art deal P projectors this year armed
this

274
00:14:17,490 --> 00:14:21,300
you know a few years ago since actually
like 2009 eighteen people in all you can

275
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:24,529
use a projector in resonance really
corners commercial things to do it

276
00:14:24,529 --> 00:14:27,769
and this year it's become a thing there
several key starters for it

277
00:14:27,769 --> 00:14:31,300
down and it looks like this may be one
the new technologies that in four years

278
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:33,100
in like a geyser on the LPGA

279
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:36,410
just day during about it home and you
know

280
00:14:36,410 --> 00:14:40,019
the same way to be nine credible think
EXR now in you

281
00:14:40,019 --> 00:14:43,730
this is basically a projector where you
have a loss of resin

282
00:14:43,730 --> 00:14:47,029
and your shining light into in the resin
hardened and Elaine and see

283
00:14:47,029 --> 00:14:50,910
in the lab director object that way arm
so this is a technology that's

284
00:14:50,910 --> 00:14:54,930
that's just coming in on laser cutters
in the four years since laser cutters

285
00:14:54,930 --> 00:14:57,160
they actually haven't changed a whole
lot

286
00:14:57,160 --> 00:15:00,569
arm there's a couple open source laser
cutters the instructions are so hard to

287
00:15:00,570 --> 00:15:02,839
find his officers on show yourself

288
00:15:02,839 --> 00:15:06,769
arm dizzying still cost a thousand
dollars it cost a thousand dollars

289
00:15:06,769 --> 00:15:09,070
doesn't cost a thousand dollars today

290
00:15:09,070 --> 00:15:13,240
so I don't know if that's owner loss but
the sauna things we talked about there's

291
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:16,269
talking to does need that we're gonna
imprison people should open source laser

292
00:15:16,269 --> 00:15:17,240
cutter companies

293
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:20,380
and that has not that hasn't worked out
that so many things that we're hoping

294
00:15:20,380 --> 00:15:21,519
for that

295
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:25,199
just happy differently on another one is
Lee

296
00:15:25,199 --> 00:15:29,329
Electronics has changed him doing are
some research on what has changed on

297
00:15:29,329 --> 00:15:31,290
trance was interesting because

298
00:15:31,290 --> 00:15:34,300
there hasn't been a revolution electron
it's it's not like

299
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:37,320
oh hey we had you know

300
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:40,730
at now and then some leaders this and I
can snap your fingers make things

301
00:15:40,730 --> 00:15:44,050
arm it has been a revolution there has
been an evolution there's

302
00:15:44,050 --> 00:15:47,079
bigger processors you can get there's
the you know the Raspberry Pi

303
00:15:47,079 --> 00:15:50,339
the Beagle bones on the Arduino so
instead of being like

304
00:15:50,339 --> 00:15:54,060
he can leak in AVR there's actually a
family have different things you can get

305
00:15:54,060 --> 00:15:57,240
on the Billy like plug it in and get it
running within a few minutes and serve a

306
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:58,310
few hours

307
00:15:58,310 --> 00:16:01,740
has really improved but now this is Ben
brand new technology that

308
00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:04,990
nothing is similar to issue spend every
year eclipse forward

309
00:16:04,990 --> 00:16:08,550
on and this is one of the big discussion
the 2008 that also didn't

310
00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:12,519
didn't pan out there's a lot of talk in
into an issue is not about

311
00:16:12,519 --> 00:16:15,930
building something in heart was gonna be
as easy software immediately

312
00:16:15,930 --> 00:16:18,680
you know you're here Eagle yield is
trying to drop the thing you'll hear

313
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:19,040
auto

314
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:23,410
row in a lot around you auto asked me
Nadal give you national graph above the

315
00:16:23,410 --> 00:16:27,230
electrically forms and they're really
this super-soft the desert but hasn't

316
00:16:27,230 --> 00:16:30,769
it has become something that just you
know nerds in general hackers and

317
00:16:30,769 --> 00:16:32,959
general have access to

318
00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:36,110
home si ESO and overviews basically you
know

319
00:16:36,110 --> 00:16:40,050
there's what more people there's more
hackerspace is there's a lot more Maker

320
00:16:40,050 --> 00:16:40,930
Faires

321
00:16:40,930 --> 00:16:45,029
every shiny 3d printer company this is
which is kinda awesome

322
00:16:45,029 --> 00:16:48,740
arm Sony in you know me it's kind of
awesome four years ago

323
00:16:48,740 --> 00:16:52,149
I gave a talk here hope and I was like
way my hands and saying

324
00:16:52,149 --> 00:16:56,290
garzarelli do all this cool stuff and
now suite of an easy if he really

325
00:16:56,290 --> 00:16:59,490
guys we did all this cool stuff on bleak

326
00:16:59,490 --> 00:17:02,810
there's actually serving or there's the
ability to go out and make a plastic

327
00:17:02,810 --> 00:17:03,399
object

328
00:17:03,399 --> 00:17:08,010
be reliably like you know the you can
matters you want to be purging design

329
00:17:08,010 --> 00:17:10,250
something and have in your hand hours
later

330
00:17:10,250 --> 00:17:13,990
and really 2008 that was a day dream
that was like this is the future and if

331
00:17:13,990 --> 00:17:14,780
we can do this

332
00:17:14,780 --> 00:17:18,668
in the next 10 years will be awesome
Armin we did and for

333
00:17:18,669 --> 00:17:21,829
arm I so what's next the next section
I'm just gonna talk about

334
00:17:21,829 --> 00:17:25,500
some mind crazy ideas about what might
be next on the plate

335
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:28,710
and where things still could be improved
and

336
00:17:28,710 --> 00:17:33,860
think it worked on someone as I think a
lot of the community evocation stuff

337
00:17:33,860 --> 00:17:37,610
from from fabrication itself to the
community aspect

338
00:17:37,610 --> 00:17:41,590
love DIY stuff like that arm is is
somewhere

339
00:17:41,590 --> 00:17:45,090
on this first peak chunk %uh this

340
00:17:45,090 --> 00:17:48,649
love this awesome time liners getting on
this is really great

341
00:17:48,650 --> 00:17:51,830
this is man chairman Tom getting

342
00:17:51,830 --> 00:17:55,960
granites I think it's granites char
somebody

343
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:59,860
gardeners thank you on this is Gartner's
hype cycle

344
00:17:59,860 --> 00:18:02,910
any sort out the technology trigger rate
ni

345
00:18:02,910 --> 00:18:06,380
pitifully that's when your res rating
newspaper articles about how cold is

346
00:18:06,380 --> 00:18:07,690
blog posts

347
00:18:07,690 --> 00:18:11,260
I'll tough decision that's made its a
Twitter everything really

348
00:18:11,260 --> 00:18:14,309
I hate this it doesn't actually arm

349
00:18:14,309 --> 00:18:17,399
enlightenment I don't know if that's
really invest more slope of Lake

350
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:21,200
giving up on your expectations something
and then is actually useful

351
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:23,710
and I really think we're still on all
the stuff we're still somewhere in this

352
00:18:23,710 --> 00:18:24,860
first bomb

353
00:18:24,860 --> 00:18:28,830
I I don't think we reach the trough on
on any these technologies

354
00:18:28,830 --> 00:18:32,949
or any videos yet um

355
00:18:32,950 --> 00:18:36,140
and I think part in a trough is going to
be when we search realize what's going

356
00:18:36,140 --> 00:18:36,770
to fail

357
00:18:36,770 --> 00:18:39,480
like right now when you talk to people
through me it's all about what the cool

358
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:40,309
stuff is

359
00:18:40,309 --> 00:18:44,549
know we talked about here's what's gonna
go wrong here's what's gonna fail here's

360
00:18:44,549 --> 00:18:46,720
how people really get angry here's the
lawsuits

361
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:50,870
on Michael Weinberg has an awesome talk
tomorrow I believe which is

362
00:18:50,870 --> 00:18:53,970
arm gonna be it'll be awesome if they
don't screw it up

363
00:18:53,970 --> 00:18:57,440
and the I think means Washington but
kinda meet us to

364
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:01,590
but at times I can arm how you how many
people read

365
00:19:01,590 --> 00:19:04,909
as a chance book the future and how to
stop it

366
00:19:04,910 --> 00:19:09,240
its it's it's a good book it's about how
did they see a push to close down

367
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:12,530
the Internet and a lot of its peer to
peer NIS

368
00:19:12,530 --> 00:19:17,120
you know people want in close it am trip
like they traditionally closed

369
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:20,150
shirt farming land and and privatize it

370
00:19:20,150 --> 00:19:24,270
arm and he did a good job responding
early on Lake what's gonna happen after

371
00:19:24,270 --> 00:19:25,620
the truck what those values are

372
00:19:25,620 --> 00:19:28,710
and I do you think that like you don't
see a lot of dollars on three

373
00:19:28,710 --> 00:19:32,059
burning talking about like 00 is a
equally accessible to you

374
00:19:32,059 --> 00:19:35,080
people who are well off people are poor
you don't see a lot of girls and Malik

375
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:38,549
okay how's it going to get abused onsite
I think that were non

376
00:19:38,549 --> 00:19:43,429
we're on that to solution yet

377
00:19:43,429 --> 00:19:47,220
arm yes oh later today Michael Weinberg
today the later this week and make one

378
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:48,289
for will be giving a talk

379
00:19:48,289 --> 00:19:52,070
that these the recaps this this is a
awesome fantastic

380
00:19:52,070 --> 00:19:55,500
presentation is an awesome PDF you can
just go to public knowledge and download

381
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:56,220
it

382
00:19:56,220 --> 00:19:59,630
arm the very long story major is that

383
00:19:59,630 --> 00:20:03,520
yeah it'll be awesome if they don't
screw it up on sharing music is for

384
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:05,870
Nikon the original sin to the internet
there's all this stuff like

385
00:20:05,870 --> 00:20:09,250
all yeah but we want to block
file-sharers Nadal and he became a

386
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:09,870
bohemian

387
00:20:09,870 --> 00:20:13,929
any him into a way to say we want to
limit this because I love

388
00:20:13,929 --> 00:20:18,409
vouchers arm and what are the legal
imperfections like

389
00:20:18,409 --> 00:20:21,409
they're going to do this with reprinting
when companies start to see that you can

390
00:20:21,409 --> 00:20:21,990
buy

391
00:20:21,990 --> 00:20:25,100
you can purchase a little animee
character keychain reading going in

392
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:26,890
paying eight bucks for the comic shop

393
00:20:26,890 --> 00:20:30,260
they really hot enough an official how
that can be like tells people to take

394
00:20:30,260 --> 00:20:32,809
those designs down and delete them and
stuff

395
00:20:32,809 --> 00:20:35,990
and they're gonna try to do it and his
point is that we should

396
00:20:35,990 --> 00:20:39,799
be thoughtful about this and perhaps I'm
so if you have if you don't have a talk

397
00:20:39,799 --> 00:20:40,700
you really wanna look

398
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:43,750
in a slot I would like open it up and
circle it Michael Weinberg

399
00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:47,390
on its an awesome presentations unveiled
today as when you're a couple years ago

400
00:20:47,390 --> 00:20:50,580
are as basically what we need to do to
defends

401
00:20:50,580 --> 00:20:53,960
these new superpowers we have on because
they're super powers

402
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:57,190
and people want to take them away and
they won all those for powers

403
00:20:57,190 --> 00:21:01,350
you themselves on an artist is also the
search

404
00:21:01,350 --> 00:21:05,610
sharp edge open source hardware arm you
know it's a little bit rusty you can cut

405
00:21:05,610 --> 00:21:08,270
yourself on it but it's open source and
you can build your own designs

406
00:21:08,270 --> 00:21:11,879
Armani things that we didn't C four
years ago that I think will happen in

407
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:12,820
the next four years

408
00:21:12,820 --> 00:21:16,039
as you're gonna see a lot more stuff
being bill as open source hardware

409
00:21:16,039 --> 00:21:19,740
I think one is that's gonna cause that
is there so much technology to build on

410
00:21:19,740 --> 00:21:20,220
top

411
00:21:20,220 --> 00:21:23,620
lotteries in Linux has gone into so many
devices is because

412
00:21:23,620 --> 00:21:27,380
as a developer is an engineer you
looking like oh man I can see two years

413
00:21:27,380 --> 00:21:31,309
by using this platform but if I do see
those two years those two years will

414
00:21:31,309 --> 00:21:32,460
cost me

415
00:21:32,460 --> 00:21:35,559
sharing this information future arms and
there's this can ever

416
00:21:35,559 --> 00:21:38,570
a double bargains that the

417
00:21:38,570 --> 00:21:44,200
arm faustian bargain were like you're
giving up your future

418
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:47,240
entitlement to to privacy in your you

419
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:50,400
turn a little property in exchange for
leveraging all this together

420
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:55,700
so I think one thing that happens happen
is Journal of by 3-pointers that

421
00:21:55,700 --> 00:21:58,440
opens our servers become Mormon or
there's more more tools out there this

422
00:21:58,440 --> 00:21:59,990
morning words out there

423
00:21:59,990 --> 00:22:02,980
and as people bill on top of that
they're gonna be forced open source

424
00:22:02,980 --> 00:22:03,710
their hardware

425
00:22:03,710 --> 00:22:06,780
and likely this has been a snowball and
Oakley point where

426
00:22:06,780 --> 00:22:10,100
there's a slight breeze ovens are smart
and it's so tempting to just use that

427
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:13,120
get a jump start the people choose to
use that and then

428
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:16,200
kinda you'll ever since joining the
community on

429
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:20,370
even if their short term economic
interests isn't there

430
00:22:20,370 --> 00:22:23,630
the long-term overall Lake better
believe lation

431
00:22:23,630 --> 00:22:27,140
the big economic picture will support it
so I think that

432
00:22:27,140 --> 00:22:32,890
open hardwares is going beyond the
things a ship's in the next two years

433
00:22:32,890 --> 00:22:35,429
nursing and i think is is really
interesting about this that's going to

434
00:22:35,429 --> 00:22:36,000
change in

435
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:39,400
arm is the marginal cost love

436
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:43,720
other a functionality its condition when
you're many many fishing hardware

437
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:47,690
most things if you're making a million
iPods the real causes the marginal cost

438
00:22:47,690 --> 00:22:48,400
us

439
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:52,570
up the iPod it's the and plus one iPod
what that cost per city and iPod

440
00:22:52,570 --> 00:22:55,770
in all the engineering all design
becomes

441
00:22:55,770 --> 00:22:59,600
I'll it's a marginal there it's like it
the spears in the decimal point when you

442
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:00,309
make a million

443
00:23:00,309 --> 00:23:05,480
the weird thing is on the total opposite
sites of course the exact opposite

444
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:09,950
software that's the marginal cost and
features because when you copy to CD we

445
00:23:09,950 --> 00:23:10,580
knew

446
00:23:10,580 --> 00:23:14,020
emails a PDF to someone when you zip-up
that

447
00:23:14,020 --> 00:23:17,559
you know when using that copy of Ubuntu
in and put on a

448
00:23:17,559 --> 00:23:21,080
flash drive through a different across
the room that back copy is

449
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:25,830
basically free and the real cost is all
the set a possible design possible to

450
00:23:25,830 --> 00:23:26,510
build cost

451
00:23:26,510 --> 00:23:29,900
on so i think is actually get there
media really interesting arm

452
00:23:29,900 --> 00:23:34,380
cost curve that comes out Nov the the
DIY manufacturing

453
00:23:34,380 --> 00:23:37,770
where it's not gonna be totally free
because the designs are free but it's

454
00:23:37,770 --> 00:23:38,908
gonna be cheap because

455
00:23:38,909 --> 00:23:41,990
your leveraging all that designed you
can use also been content

456
00:23:41,990 --> 00:23:45,260
but same time it's over to Casa material
so I think all those curves are very

457
00:23:45,260 --> 00:23:46,059
simple

458
00:23:46,059 --> 00:23:50,149
hockey hockey ship terms and I think a
lot of 3d printing a lot of the airline

459
00:23:50,150 --> 00:23:52,090
manufacturing curves are gonna be a more

460
00:23:52,090 --> 00:23:56,260
more complex you know more complex
equation to figure out is this worth it

461
00:23:56,260 --> 00:23:57,260
is it not

462
00:23:57,260 --> 00:24:00,929
arm are gonna make money on hardware are
going to make millions of RVs not gonna

463
00:24:00,929 --> 00:24:01,830
make any money all

464
00:24:01,830 --> 00:24:05,470
I think those are gonna be smidgen
questions arm and right now neither one

465
00:24:05,470 --> 00:24:06,909
is offers a sweet spot

466
00:24:06,909 --> 00:24:12,120
arm a lot of the software for all love
this DIY fabrication stuff a lot of

467
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:13,809
software for managing groups

468
00:24:13,809 --> 00:24:17,299
a lot and software for like having a
community space for managing inventory

469
00:24:17,299 --> 00:24:18,830
managing do stuff like that

470
00:24:18,830 --> 00:24:22,320
all this is horrible arm so I think and
other things like basically

471
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:26,649
the its it's really in six offers
supposedly really easy me

472
00:24:26,650 --> 00:24:30,419
nobly that on and there's all these
problems are beastly

473
00:24:30,419 --> 00:24:33,990
really good software problems are
managing communiquer

474
00:24:33,990 --> 00:24:37,400
managing inventory managing search
supplies nothing really does this file

475
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:40,960
I've loved it commercials of rival to
open source offer there's a lot of

476
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:42,059
solutions

477
00:24:42,059 --> 00:24:45,270
all of them are really changing and
hockey on and then to go to a

478
00:24:45,270 --> 00:24:47,960
fabrication site sitting on the
fabrication site if you open up your

479
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:48,799
average

480
00:24:48,799 --> 00:24:53,120
CNC milling program and you like 10
understand what's actually doing or what

481
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:54,039
its Miley here

482
00:24:54,039 --> 00:24:57,320
make a guess as its will be it's
actually pretty tough flick

483
00:24:57,320 --> 00:25:00,389
you have to read to the Jeep elijah is
to really know the machine and sign up

484
00:25:00,390 --> 00:25:01,140
to trusted

485
00:25:01,140 --> 00:25:05,169
on three players are a little bit better
but there nearly as bad

486
00:25:05,169 --> 00:25:08,230
three ping software out there is you
know

487
00:25:08,230 --> 00:25:11,650
and I worked on it I I feel no shame in
saying this it's a bit hokey

488
00:25:11,650 --> 00:25:14,809
it's a bit live together arm and there's
a lot of work to improve that

489
00:25:14,809 --> 00:25:17,990
and I think that as we talk about
fabrication and

490
00:25:17,990 --> 00:25:21,279
and accessibility that accessibility

491
00:25:21,279 --> 00:25:24,409
the user interface that accessibility of
I do this and I can

492
00:25:24,409 --> 00:25:27,890
assume with a machine gun and organising
how it works I think there's gonna be

493
00:25:27,890 --> 00:25:29,110
huge wins there

494
00:25:29,110 --> 00:25:33,289
and I think that's that's when things a
lot of people early working on right now

495
00:25:33,289 --> 00:25:37,640
I'm furiously to try to to improve it

496
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:40,529
so I guess that's a little over here
right things things kinda are and where

497
00:25:40,529 --> 00:25:41,650
they're going in the next year's

498
00:25:41,650 --> 00:25:44,700
arm and this next section is just

499
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:48,650
crazy ideas and rants & and vs

500
00:25:48,650 --> 00:25:52,770
so are more than to see versus feel I
think

501
00:25:52,770 --> 00:25:56,650
a lotta stuff gets very inching because
its getting back to that empowering

502
00:25:56,650 --> 00:25:57,520
community

503
00:25:57,520 --> 00:26:02,020
here again how many people are a diamond
age and how many people read

504
00:26:02,020 --> 00:26:06,970
unusual straight primaries are and how
many people know that the same book

505
00:26:06,970 --> 00:26:11,049
vision and me people are sleep raise
your hand

506
00:26:11,049 --> 00:26:15,820
their country on so wanna be talks that
I want this is the sea purses the field

507
00:26:15,820 --> 00:26:17,520
but the new nine teams have the feed

508
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:21,990
the trip they pull molecules in a
control how that's converted into you

509
00:26:21,990 --> 00:26:26,679
the basic elements and then you buy that
you by the the compilers and compilers

510
00:26:26,679 --> 00:26:30,100
and that was a control technology where
it's centrally hell

511
00:26:30,100 --> 00:26:34,570
and the sea technology is okay here's
seen it it builds watching it on site

512
00:26:34,570 --> 00:26:38,730
on I think there's there's mentioning
talk about where these things intersect

513
00:26:38,730 --> 00:26:39,120
a1

514
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:42,750
people I think saw the Internet as a
giant see technology as a pure

515
00:26:42,750 --> 00:26:43,409
technology

516
00:26:43,409 --> 00:26:46,610
I think you certainly sent it hasn't
lived up to those expectations

517
00:26:46,610 --> 00:26:50,520
I think the Internet has really become
another massive feeding technology where

518
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:54,010
a few websites get the most visits you
really aren't appear you really are a

519
00:26:54,010 --> 00:26:56,039
client nine usually people here

520
00:26:56,039 --> 00:26:58,779
if you look at how we use the
information you need to use the internet

521
00:26:58,779 --> 00:27:01,130
you're not serving so if you're
consuming stuff

522
00:27:01,130 --> 00:27:05,390
in your not appear with anything you're
years as the old I

523
00:27:05,390 --> 00:27:10,490
trained European CNN or trainee circuit
a web server that will never be as good

524
00:27:10,490 --> 00:27:14,600
as a bigger so I I think that and i
think is mention things talk about in

525
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:14,909
this

526
00:27:14,909 --> 00:27:19,549
on having this from unit manufacturing
getting laser cutters three players and

527
00:27:19,549 --> 00:27:20,799
things into people's houses

528
00:27:20,799 --> 00:27:25,350
I think will push towards that's the
technology will push towards

529
00:27:25,350 --> 00:27:30,390
handle this myself and I think we may
have gotten lucky as a civilization

530
00:27:30,390 --> 00:27:34,049
that the people in the vendors were open
source nuts rather than people who want

531
00:27:34,049 --> 00:27:35,490
to control stuff I think that if

532
00:27:35,490 --> 00:27:39,039
four years ago the rep rep project was
instead was like

533
00:27:39,039 --> 00:27:43,399
you know upstate a non colleges

534
00:27:43,399 --> 00:27:47,409
commercial 3 start-up I think would be
much different ecosystem today

535
00:27:47,409 --> 00:27:51,299
and I think we're really lucky that a
lot about people who initially into you

536
00:27:51,299 --> 00:27:54,960
Rep rather initially in in the 3d
printing stuff arm

537
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:58,860
where we're having an open source

538
00:27:58,860 --> 00:28:02,539
on other things she is invention lost
the rain we talk about the chin

539
00:28:02,539 --> 00:28:05,990
the rate of change increases every year
and every year there's more tools

540
00:28:05,990 --> 00:28:08,539
there's more source code there's more
example boards

541
00:28:08,539 --> 00:28:11,960
there's more brains to pick in all these
topics arm

542
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:15,140
Sony things is like we are increasingly
a loss like

543
00:28:15,140 --> 00:28:19,399
you know three pretty company is almost
always are building their test models on

544
00:28:19,399 --> 00:28:22,539
3-pointers Kenny call you build the
thing the bills next thing

545
00:28:22,539 --> 00:28:26,620
arm you know software design companies
are using the faster CPU design even

546
00:28:26,620 --> 00:28:28,960
faster CPU Z delivered as a self

547
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:32,570
already inching things about this is
that then

548
00:28:32,570 --> 00:28:35,668
because it up and become a bigger and
bigger delay if you're talking about

549
00:28:35,669 --> 00:28:37,000
like the McCormick Reaper

550
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:40,690
any patent and design you get a for
twenty years that

551
00:28:40,690 --> 00:28:44,270
that's not driving the next level of
design but if you pan

552
00:28:44,270 --> 00:28:48,309
a nifty new 3d printing technique any
you have that for twenty years

553
00:28:48,309 --> 00:28:52,059
they're really slows down your body do
the next design an excellent other

554
00:28:52,059 --> 00:28:55,250
click here accumulating your delays arm

555
00:28:55,250 --> 00:28:59,130
by by on by having a delay at the first
level

556
00:28:59,130 --> 00:29:02,159
your your and plus one input signals all
on it

557
00:29:02,159 --> 00:29:05,340
slowed I noticed anything is

558
00:29:05,340 --> 00:29:08,610
I think that a lot of the 3d printing
community

559
00:29:08,610 --> 00:29:12,159
and a lot of 3d printing ecosystem is
actually really robust I think the sign

560
00:29:12,159 --> 00:29:13,230
that is

561
00:29:13,230 --> 00:29:17,620
all of the variation in all of the mom
the big competition in should

562
00:29:17,620 --> 00:29:21,039
and all the small innovations happening
on its kinda tough sometimes to talk

563
00:29:21,039 --> 00:29:22,149
about

564
00:29:22,149 --> 00:29:26,480
on movement as a whole being a part of
it because if I put on my like

565
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:29,730
I'm into open source a military green
hat and I look at

566
00:29:29,730 --> 00:29:32,799
eight million competitors may look at
you know 23

567
00:29:32,799 --> 00:29:36,149
startups doing three printing like
that's really awesome

568
00:29:36,149 --> 00:29:39,529
that's competition that's variation that
selection

569
00:29:39,529 --> 00:29:42,649
like that's you know that's evolution in
action

570
00:29:42,649 --> 00:29:45,669
on on a business kill million at the
time I like you know

571
00:29:45,669 --> 00:29:49,200
software had hail up to three different
company to build stuff actually kinda

572
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:50,510
scary because certainly

573
00:29:50,510 --> 00:29:54,190
its less guaranteed and there's a
synching balance between

574
00:29:54,190 --> 00:29:57,260
you know markets like competition

575
00:29:57,260 --> 00:30:00,640
a player in the market heats it they
don't want that some I think

576
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:03,919
as a as a market as a whole big thing I
think that there's actually a really

577
00:30:03,919 --> 00:30:05,059
good sign that

578
00:30:05,059 --> 00:30:08,240
mom cue and no Joe

579
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:11,240
and in all these different variations
that are based on like the repre-

580
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:14,580
designs are out there because things can
drive innovation for

581
00:30:14,580 --> 00:30:17,908
on if you don't know the which shot
here's

582
00:30:17,909 --> 00:30:21,830
that he is but Mills but they originally
purchased by three systems

583
00:30:21,830 --> 00:30:25,360
threesomes buying everything they can
it's kind of amusing every excision like

584
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:27,690
a three sons bought nifty surtax

585
00:30:27,690 --> 00:30:31,600
and you know thats are we doing on the
modules were the commercial

586
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:34,779
that's how 3-pointers aren't they came
out earlier this year

587
00:30:34,779 --> 00:30:38,419
on they're trying to get into the
desktop great market arm and it's really

588
00:30:38,419 --> 00:30:40,529
kind of more for pressures line agency

589
00:30:40,529 --> 00:30:43,529
nom in your car is the Cuba Cuba is
another

590
00:30:43,529 --> 00:30:46,649
mister that's another arm

591
00:30:46,649 --> 00:30:49,870
a three per company the computer
cartridge

592
00:30:49,870 --> 00:30:54,049
arm and then the bill the Tron is based
on a whole class i think is an awful

593
00:30:54,049 --> 00:30:54,639
knives

594
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:58,850
armenians bottles fishing as the top to
really come on a river community

595
00:30:58,850 --> 00:31:02,779
the deceased and a plastic you can just
you know do whatever you want anything

596
00:31:02,779 --> 00:31:04,460
apart designs are online

597
00:31:04,460 --> 00:31:07,580
in the bottom two real economic
commercial world and you can tell just

598
00:31:07,580 --> 00:31:10,668
from their designs like these guys have
leaks your cartridges

599
00:31:10,669 --> 00:31:14,059
they have like magic flute issues
washington's of Lake everything is

600
00:31:14,059 --> 00:31:17,639
proprietary everything is like the ink
cartridge base system where

601
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:21,019
you really nothing countries and you're
not know for the laces change it

602
00:31:21,019 --> 00:31:24,610
seen by another 100 or ink cartridge and
you know

603
00:31:24,610 --> 00:31:28,250
legislation you see the assumptions and
the designs that people generally are

604
00:31:28,250 --> 00:31:28,710
all

605
00:31:28,710 --> 00:31:31,820
very much based in you know

606
00:31:31,820 --> 00:31:34,980
their ideology from home

607
00:31:34,980 --> 00:31:38,010
and I think she project in this line is
the global build construction site on

608
00:31:38,010 --> 00:31:40,000
this is really cool project they're
trying to build

609
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:43,100
everything you need to be sleep build up
a civilization

610
00:31:43,100 --> 00:31:46,750
and they're trying to have forklifts &
trucks

611
00:31:46,750 --> 00:31:50,220
and brick makers and bread on things
like that on and

612
00:31:50,220 --> 00:31:53,419
there's several really cool things about
this and what is its an attempt to take

613
00:31:53,419 --> 00:31:54,019
this model

614
00:31:54,019 --> 00:31:57,809
and to give answers mollen put it out on
all searches

615
00:31:57,809 --> 00:32:02,080
takes a product types of projects arm I
think any cheap things is what projects

616
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:03,649
they've picked in what they haven't

617
00:32:03,649 --> 00:32:06,860
I think they've done a really good job
picking some other big equipment but if

618
00:32:06,860 --> 00:32:07,610
you really look at

619
00:32:07,610 --> 00:32:10,899
the things that have saved him in time
arm water

620
00:32:10,899 --> 00:32:14,250
liking access the water's been what are
the biggest and savers for Humanity

621
00:32:14,250 --> 00:32:18,519
on and washing clothes and doing some
meals and maintenance ass roundhouse

622
00:32:18,519 --> 00:32:19,450
have been a really big

623
00:32:19,450 --> 00:32:22,950
time saver so if you're looking at all
those projections at

624
00:32:22,950 --> 00:32:26,110
arm you know they're looking like o'hare
stable the building

625
00:32:26,110 --> 00:32:29,450
and there's not much like oh here's how
you wash clothes you say keep water

626
00:32:29,450 --> 00:32:32,760
so it's just interesting to see what
focus happens

627
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:35,870
in these different groups are and I
think that

628
00:32:35,870 --> 00:32:39,149
I don't think that this is going to
grown adopt the same with that unit

629
00:32:39,149 --> 00:32:39,940
technologist

630
00:32:39,940 --> 00:32:43,940
I think that there's another commercial
companies enough competition of people

631
00:32:43,940 --> 00:32:45,850
being pretty efficient building these
things

632
00:32:45,850 --> 00:32:48,750
you need to make more profit at it that
it's gonna be hard to break in and say

633
00:32:48,750 --> 00:32:50,539
oh we're gonna do not search version
like

634
00:32:50,539 --> 00:32:54,760
nobody is pushing for an open-source
refrigerator which I really want because

635
00:32:54,760 --> 00:32:58,760
I can get my refrigerator click to get
from July wantonly

636
00:32:58,760 --> 00:33:02,269
where the firmware right I want to make
this 10 degrees and I can't I can only

637
00:33:02,269 --> 00:33:03,260
go to Six

638
00:33:03,260 --> 00:33:08,370
arm but it's inching that only only new
technologies I think are really going to

639
00:33:08,370 --> 00:33:09,600
benefit from this

640
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:12,760
shift towards open source and I think
it's gonna be hard to go back

641
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:17,080
and do it global those attractions is
doing is they're trying to push this

642
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:18,070
back in using

643
00:33:18,070 --> 00:33:21,090
industries is this new products and I
think that's I think it's harder than

644
00:33:21,090 --> 00:33:24,630
anybody initially thought it would be

645
00:33:24,630 --> 00:33:28,039
living St is inching talk about this is
like why did this happen

646
00:33:28,039 --> 00:33:32,360
for arm trading the stalking going
through the stuff

647
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:35,940
I was looking on a certain frankly a lot
of what we have

648
00:33:35,940 --> 00:33:39,250
al mana la technologie year it isn't
rocket science a lot in the open source

649
00:33:39,250 --> 00:33:39,870
projects

650
00:33:39,870 --> 00:33:43,230
are not are not something that you need
six years

651
00:33:43,230 --> 00:33:48,080
education dealing a two-year degree can
really teach enough to do most the stuff

652
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:51,240
and you know is just mention that it
that it took this long

653
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:54,600
allotted village idiot is is driving
open source right now

654
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:58,909
on you know the laser cutters so it's
really pretty stuff

655
00:33:58,909 --> 00:34:02,419
are a lot of the circuit design politics
is fully awake it's been around for

656
00:34:02,419 --> 00:34:03,140
years

657
00:34:03,140 --> 00:34:06,399
and it's really itching to me like why
this never happened before

658
00:34:06,399 --> 00:34:10,179
and I I don't think it was just happens
I think there's something about

659
00:34:10,179 --> 00:34:15,099
the access to knowledge in the Andean
information that you can draw mine

660
00:34:15,099 --> 00:34:18,200
and he really say I need to learn this I
don't need to go on hunted down

661
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:22,770
I consider my computer and you and mess
around and dig it up a little by little

662
00:34:22,770 --> 00:34:25,750
piece by piece like there's something
about the grass ability that I don't

663
00:34:25,750 --> 00:34:27,770
think it has anything to do with the
legal climate

664
00:34:27,770 --> 00:34:31,389
I don't think is anything to do with the
actual difficulty that technology has a

665
00:34:31,389 --> 00:34:32,109
lot to do with

666
00:34:32,109 --> 00:34:36,520
how we share information only access it
arm and I'm curious to me is it here at

667
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:37,040
like to hear

668
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:43,009
like why this took so long to take part
in it hasn't happened

669
00:34:43,010 --> 00:34:46,419
CSR computer ish evocation 2016 so arm

670
00:34:46,418 --> 00:34:49,810
based on sort of crazy ideas aspect of
it

671
00:34:49,810 --> 00:34:53,290
arm this is kinda what I'm guessing
where things are gonna go

672
00:34:53,290 --> 00:34:57,900
and I'm you know just guessing arm I
don't think I don't think you know it's

673
00:34:57,900 --> 00:34:58,970
bizarre Andrea Saul

674
00:34:58,970 --> 00:35:02,079
I think a lot of people right now are
really in a hackerspace in early in the

675
00:35:02,079 --> 00:35:02,880
US bases

676
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:07,420
I think they bring a tonya community arm
but I sees efforts like

677
00:35:07,420 --> 00:35:11,369
all you know local village library is
gonna set up their hackerspace

678
00:35:11,369 --> 00:35:14,630
I think that's awesome I think they
should do it by also think that a lot of

679
00:35:14,630 --> 00:35:15,369
them have

680
00:35:15,369 --> 00:35:20,160
I love them have overzealous ambitions
for what I can become

681
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:23,759
so I think a lot of spaces are gonna
level of their own regional activity

682
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:24,589
that will become

683
00:35:24,589 --> 00:35:27,820
their little activity a lot of them are
so like they get really busy in a

684
00:35:27,820 --> 00:35:30,290
slowdown in the a busy and I think
that's going to be calm

685
00:35:30,290 --> 00:35:33,690
just another you know just another
project in their community here people

686
00:35:33,690 --> 00:35:34,359
involved in

687
00:35:34,359 --> 00:35:38,270
arm I think some other funny version are
going to be funded I think some people

688
00:35:38,270 --> 00:35:42,000
went out to nonprofits a big 12 years
they have these big visions of

689
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:45,490
everyone in town will learn how to
solder and I think

690
00:35:45,490 --> 00:35:48,480
in it in the next four years people
realize that's not monitoring these are

691
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:49,329
not southern Italy

692
00:35:49,329 --> 00:35:52,880
possible outsider arm so I think it's
going to you

693
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:57,210
I think still alive on also this message
because I think it's becoming a meager

694
00:35:57,210 --> 00:35:58,660
culture and agriculture

695
00:35:58,660 --> 00:36:02,029
I think a lotta a lot other

696
00:36:02,030 --> 00:36:05,829
a lot of the spacing was driven by
hackers basis I think Packer was a party

697
00:36:05,829 --> 00:36:07,150
the terminology hackers party

698
00:36:07,150 --> 00:36:10,970
goal and its finishing over the last
four years to wash the hacker get dialed

699
00:36:10,970 --> 00:36:12,970
down and the maker get dialed up

700
00:36:12,970 --> 00:36:16,369
arm and I think there's good and bad in
that and I can

701
00:36:16,369 --> 00:36:19,820
you know gone for a long time but I do
think that thats and I think

702
00:36:19,820 --> 00:36:23,450
every year I see that the hacker
community lecture download in the maker

703
00:36:23,450 --> 00:36:27,578
component that chernobyl arm three
pretty I think

704
00:36:27,579 --> 00:36:31,190
I actually think three friends gonna get
inching in their careers especially for

705
00:36:31,190 --> 00:36:32,650
people that make money from

706
00:36:32,650 --> 00:36:37,130
like lawyers and stuff because I really
think that

707
00:36:37,130 --> 00:36:40,599
so you know there's the old saying you
what for saying are you then they laugh

708
00:36:40,599 --> 00:36:42,700
at you then they fight you then you win

709
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:45,760
I think there somewhere between knowing
and laughing at arm

710
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:49,550
and I think the fight is gonna be
couched largely in

711
00:36:49,550 --> 00:36:53,060
legal terminology I'm I think a lot of
places are gonna go ding japan porn

712
00:36:53,060 --> 00:36:54,440
trying to push this out

713
00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:58,270
I need to slow down innovation on I
worry a little bit a lot lot of the new

714
00:36:58,270 --> 00:36:59,220
3-pointer companies

715
00:36:59,220 --> 00:37:02,290
are gonna see the legal gay man wanna
play it or have to play

716
00:37:02,290 --> 00:37:05,349
before she the position where if they
don't get it up and if they don't deal

717
00:37:05,349 --> 00:37:06,109
with that

718
00:37:06,109 --> 00:37:09,470
arm during the two and I think that's an
unfortunate

719
00:37:09,470 --> 00:37:12,540
I think that a lot of the innovation
happens when you can

720
00:37:12,540 --> 00:37:15,420
Louisville is possible you don't stop
the engineers that check with the

721
00:37:15,420 --> 00:37:16,380
lawyers are in town and

722
00:37:16,380 --> 00:37:19,990
but I I just think it's a necessity site
I think three people do that

723
00:37:19,990 --> 00:37:23,810
arm yeah I think there's going to be a
feature fishing

724
00:37:23,810 --> 00:37:27,940
I think people regard set out patents
that are gonna say okay we want me

725
00:37:27,940 --> 00:37:31,260
we're going to the speech in the next
couple years and we need to protect it

726
00:37:31,260 --> 00:37:34,250
and i think is happening on and
ministries I just think that's gonna be

727
00:37:34,250 --> 00:37:36,160
a side effect of 3 p.m. growing

728
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:39,839
is that it's gonna happen companies
gonna have to do that

729
00:37:39,839 --> 00:37:42,940
to keep thriving arm and that's about it

730
00:37:42,940 --> 00:37:45,950
are I do think it for your system is
something we look for the killer app

731
00:37:45,950 --> 00:37:48,859
like there's a big discussion like we
need to get that thing that proves this

732
00:37:48,859 --> 00:37:51,710
is something in your garage we need to
have something that says

733
00:37:51,710 --> 00:37:55,010
this is why you're gonna brag about this

734
00:37:55,010 --> 00:37:59,680
at the barbecue in your neighbor Ted is
gonna be like no duty any orders

735
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:03,839
dubbed anderson's have might happen to I
don't think we figure that out and I

736
00:38:03,839 --> 00:38:08,000
I think I don't think we'll have to
figure out in four years

737
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:13,050
I do think that on the open source and
open hardware mindset from

738
00:38:13,050 --> 00:38:16,530
hackerspace and things I think that's
continuing to spread and

739
00:38:16,530 --> 00:38:20,500
you know better I think it's gonna be
like Louis I think there's going to be

740
00:38:20,500 --> 00:38:24,510
a lot of community support i think is
going to be a few successful companies

741
00:38:24,510 --> 00:38:27,869
that are doing this and I think you know
it's gonna be

742
00:38:27,869 --> 00:38:31,109
this really interesting mix of cultures
that is a broad culture with a lot of

743
00:38:31,109 --> 00:38:31,859
variance

744
00:38:31,859 --> 00:38:35,828
and then a couple high points I'll you
know of

745
00:38:35,829 --> 00:38:39,119
sorted key year sorting your mean

746
00:38:39,119 --> 00:38:42,790
notable happens I think the rich
cultures also unique changeable my think

747
00:38:42,790 --> 00:38:44,509
the general DIY hands-on just

748
00:38:44,510 --> 00:38:48,700
its not exploding like it did two or
three years ago but anything's gonna

749
00:38:48,700 --> 00:38:49,730
keep going

750
00:38:49,730 --> 00:38:53,420
arm again all likelihood that he's gonna
be a very community German culture

751
00:38:53,420 --> 00:38:57,240
arm I think that the numbers conventions
number of events like

752
00:38:57,240 --> 00:39:00,270
hope Maker Faire armed or camp

753
00:39:00,270 --> 00:39:04,119
you know all you torque ample only a lot
of the things they came into existence

754
00:39:04,119 --> 00:39:05,240
in last year's

755
00:39:05,240 --> 00:39:08,260
anyone to see more those more the
showing up

756
00:39:08,260 --> 00:39:11,700
are many things just gonna be a slow
growth more the more accessibility for

757
00:39:11,700 --> 00:39:13,000
how to do things

758
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:17,060
on running of trains will still be hard
I think that we haven't found that magic

759
00:39:17,060 --> 00:39:20,560
are out but that just makes it easy to
make a 555 timer work

760
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:23,578
without memorizing things are looking up

761
00:39:23,579 --> 00:39:27,329
people's I are doing on on tonight I
think it will still be heard

762
00:39:27,329 --> 00:39:31,570
I think that as I think that people
working on a very hard but I think that

763
00:39:31,570 --> 00:39:35,980
there's a lot to on me to make that he's
eating in addition

764
00:39:35,980 --> 00:39:39,320
and so that's my guess at worry maybe
inanity hopes

765
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:43,000
if the hotel Pennsylvania sustaining if
they tear it down and I'll be on

766
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,349
sidewalk in four years

767
00:39:44,349 --> 00:39:47,640
you can come out level change bucket

768
00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:52,220
I miss Lisenby postcards it'll be great

769
00:39:52,220 --> 00:39:56,720
okay so that's all for me um day I had a
large amount of initial thoughts lately

770
00:39:56,720 --> 00:39:59,109
has plenty of time for question answers

771
00:39:59,109 --> 00:40:03,069
on for Rance for better ideas and for
just

772
00:40:03,069 --> 00:40:10,069
general feedback

773
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:15,390
talked a lot about the 3d printing and

774
00:40:15,390 --> 00:40:18,490
the open-source parts that people are
going to be able to you know

775
00:40:18,490 --> 00:40:23,600
download and then make are but what
about the reverse engineering aspects

776
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:26,810
and how do you feel like things like
laser scanners and

777
00:40:26,810 --> 00:40:30,100
other things that capture the

778
00:40:30,100 --> 00:40:34,690
you know fit into this whole thing I
think that's a great point I think a

779
00:40:34,690 --> 00:40:38,530
um at English casually also means a lot
of work being done on them

780
00:40:38,530 --> 00:40:43,190
this year anything flashy red flashers
are the starting to ramp up ever mean

781
00:40:43,190 --> 00:40:44,260
like okay can find me

782
00:40:44,260 --> 00:40:47,350
and reliably now I want to be able to
import reliably

783
00:40:47,350 --> 00:40:51,870
and I that's being worked on really
really seriously our mojo

784
00:40:51,870 --> 00:40:55,580
i think thats and I think it's a GI do

785
00:40:55,580 --> 00:40:59,660
I don't think Liz scanners are practice
to have the same very open source

786
00:40:59,660 --> 00:41:01,250
trajectory the 3d printing is done

787
00:41:01,250 --> 00:41:04,590
but I do think there their part to have
like an officer's component any

788
00:41:04,590 --> 00:41:08,180
if you look at their it now thinking
about Blake seven or eight laser

789
00:41:08,180 --> 00:41:08,980
scanning

790
00:41:08,980 --> 00:41:12,900
projects and only like $3 RR open source
driven

791
00:41:12,900 --> 00:41:16,950
wash the SR Commercial Drive and some
driven by ominously licensed something

792
00:41:16,950 --> 00:41:18,590
while ago here's a nine it's an app

793
00:41:18,590 --> 00:41:22,500
and you know a lot of the merger my hard
work there like kinda built in the

794
00:41:22,500 --> 00:41:24,160
nineties over the complex hardware

795
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:27,529
and they've been selling it for for
fifteen thousand dollars in the nineties

796
00:41:27,530 --> 00:41:29,650
and they're going to keep trying to sell
fifty thousand dollars

797
00:41:29,650 --> 00:41:33,040
tokoza on I also think that scanning is

798
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:37,040
is X and I know this because I think
skin is going to be hard for him for

799
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:39,060
years I think so we'll figure it out but
I think for now

800
00:41:39,060 --> 00:41:43,150
scanning is cool but I think to get a
really reliable model still take some

801
00:41:43,150 --> 00:41:44,120
manual

802
00:41:44,120 --> 00:41:48,100
management I next get attention a lot
people of so I think the idea like a

803
00:41:48,100 --> 00:41:50,860
replicator where a home user connects
can something and make

804
00:41:50,860 --> 00:41:54,680
a backup copy it like I'll do that I
broke my other I'm gonna play here miss

805
00:41:54,680 --> 00:41:57,490
Canada and then I'll just one piece
together a print

806
00:41:57,490 --> 00:42:01,150
I i think thats gonna be more than four
years away if i'm wrong.

807
00:42:01,150 --> 00:42:08,150
you be awesome to your honor arm three
times you mentioned in concert twice

808
00:42:08,600 --> 00:42:09,920
mentioned concerns with

809
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:14,780
are patent copyright or trademark
disputes impeding people trying to make

810
00:42:14,780 --> 00:42:15,140
sure

811
00:42:15,140 --> 00:42:18,779
has actually happened or is this a sign
with a concern

812
00:42:18,780 --> 00:42:22,370
arm have heard many cases all

813
00:42:22,370 --> 00:42:26,100
people in the open source 3d printing
community getting letters to place a

814
00:42:26,100 --> 00:42:30,660
you do realize that these five pens
belong to us in these five things you

815
00:42:30,660 --> 00:42:31,649
should be aware of

816
00:42:31,650 --> 00:42:35,970
arm and I I am not aware of any lawsuits
but I'm aware of several like

817
00:42:35,970 --> 00:42:39,090
lawyer to lawyer letters that you know
that's a

818
00:42:39,090 --> 00:42:42,240
hey just be careful here are 10 does
don't step on them well

819
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:45,310
there's a difference between news here's
our toes

820
00:42:45,310 --> 00:42:49,900
and cease and desist exactly yep yet
anything with the things you know

821
00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:54,360
locally our patent system is gone as
crazy as media copyright system

822
00:42:54,360 --> 00:42:58,090
or because you there a lot of hands are
today

823
00:42:58,090 --> 00:43:01,100
a lot of pens are protecting things now
early out on pens'

824
00:43:01,100 --> 00:43:04,840
the core technology is now accessible
the core technology is now open from

825
00:43:04,840 --> 00:43:05,600
people build

826
00:43:05,600 --> 00:43:08,600
not solving it allowed repre- to thrive

827
00:43:08,600 --> 00:43:12,360
arm so I think I think a lot of that is

828
00:43:12,360 --> 00:43:15,570
getting a lot of that is not going to
totally stop innovation

829
00:43:15,570 --> 00:43:18,330
I think because the core technologies
available I do think it'll slow things

830
00:43:18,330 --> 00:43:19,620
down because as a developer

831
00:43:19,620 --> 00:43:23,319
man I can't tell you the number two
hundred at had a design have drawn on

832
00:43:23,320 --> 00:43:25,730
the way but I'm like dude I'm building
this and it's going to do this

833
00:43:25,730 --> 00:43:29,040
and then you press this button and then
the legal guys

834
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:32,080
hair stand up strong during like tuesday
only going bowling season

835
00:43:32,080 --> 00:43:35,620
are you know me a couple email me a copy
and the next day is like no dude will

836
00:43:35,620 --> 00:43:37,140
you can press the button once

837
00:43:37,140 --> 00:43:41,410
you can't respond twice maybe you can
lick slide to unlock but you can press

838
00:43:41,410 --> 00:43:42,319
the button to submit

839
00:43:42,320 --> 00:43:46,010
hang on XYZ happens in the present one
and like

840
00:43:46,010 --> 00:43:51,330
it's insane a just so then what happens
inside a building it's really clean

841
00:43:51,330 --> 00:43:55,240
cool cool idea i sat down I spent hours
like Arial it would if I tacked on

842
00:43:55,240 --> 00:43:56,860
Loughner that would be kinda silly

843
00:43:56,860 --> 00:44:00,930
but I like don't want to feel like makin
in cash and you have to leave Washington

844
00:44:00,930 --> 00:44:03,509
Inc after 30 seconds and then tack is
that legal

845
00:44:03,510 --> 00:44:06,690
on any just it totally

846
00:44:06,690 --> 00:44:10,520
it just sucks developers time in
innovators time to

847
00:44:10,520 --> 00:44:14,860
you know to play stronger that way like
I've lawsuit I'll

848
00:44:14,860 --> 00:44:18,550
well here comes on and avoid all those
feature details the people of people

849
00:44:18,550 --> 00:44:18,820
have

850
00:44:18,820 --> 00:44:24,410
sir saying that alley but short happy
ran I am mostly agree with them

851
00:44:24,410 --> 00:44:27,549
with what you're saying about am where
you think than the future

852
00:44:27,550 --> 00:44:31,110
makers bases businesses going but I hope
that you missed one thing

853
00:44:31,110 --> 00:44:34,270
I hope that at the hackerspace model

854
00:44:34,270 --> 00:44:37,759
can influence education an answer to
bring in

855
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:42,520
family project based learning into the
formal education system yeah I

856
00:44:42,520 --> 00:44:46,330
I kind of worry that our education
system is so there's

857
00:44:46,330 --> 00:44:49,860
dishing out on its own in on friends
here today their education system is

858
00:44:49,860 --> 00:44:50,600
literally

859
00:44:50,600 --> 00:44:54,480
that the federal government debt like if
you have a meeting with

860
00:44:54,480 --> 00:44:58,070
the head of France's according to him
give mean head of France's

861
00:44:58,070 --> 00:45:01,360
like Minister for Education that will
set policy for everything was cool the

862
00:45:01,360 --> 00:45:02,260
country

863
00:45:02,260 --> 00:45:05,280
so I think the US has the advantage in
that we're still

864
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:08,420
we do have a lot of federal involvement
and big picture like

865
00:45:08,420 --> 00:45:11,480
they kinda don't get the local situation
but I think we have enough

866
00:45:11,480 --> 00:45:14,790
local school districts I think we have
enough local control

867
00:45:14,790 --> 00:45:18,500
that we can be more flexible so

868
00:45:18,500 --> 00:45:21,600
I don't I don't think it's super happy
picture but I think we have a chance to

869
00:45:21,600 --> 00:45:23,630
do that because we still maintain a lot
I'll

870
00:45:23,630 --> 00:45:27,430
control on and I think there's a lot of
people just looking outside the

871
00:45:27,430 --> 00:45:29,940
education system there's a lot of people
here at now about

872
00:45:29,940 --> 00:45:33,500
there's a degree there sir the degree
Bowl was like are going to get for your

873
00:45:33,500 --> 00:45:34,860
degree do anything at all

874
00:45:34,860 --> 00:45:38,630
you know owns the fries are going to get
the try management degree

875
00:45:38,630 --> 00:45:41,700
on and I think I think I I hope in the
next three is that it comes pretty

876
00:45:41,700 --> 00:45:43,320
obvious that late we'll do that

877
00:45:43,320 --> 00:45:47,080
on to put on my like make about half a
second Megabus

878
00:45:47,080 --> 00:45:50,870
it done something it is really gorgeous
traded make sure we can bring people in

879
00:45:50,870 --> 00:45:52,259
the don't have that degree and then

880
00:45:52,260 --> 00:45:55,920
teach them on the job arm we have one
guy who's an awesome he is a

881
00:45:55,920 --> 00:45:59,820
gotta ice porn is like I don't know what
I want to do her sitcom or press for two

882
00:45:59,820 --> 00:46:00,220
years

883
00:46:00,220 --> 00:46:03,330
like will help you hope you got people
work more press for two years and then

884
00:46:03,330 --> 00:46:06,150
when you worked in engineering for a
while then go back to college because

885
00:46:06,150 --> 00:46:07,080
then you'll really know

886
00:46:07,080 --> 00:46:10,500
tubular arm and I think that
apprenticeship model

887
00:46:10,500 --> 00:46:14,060
is coming back into style and I think
that that's going to get a lot of people

888
00:46:14,060 --> 00:46:15,790
who by the time they get alittle no

889
00:46:15,790 --> 00:46:20,230
along rather than just like flailing
around trying something

890
00:46:20,230 --> 00:46:24,300
so are you talked about hackerspace is
becoming more maker spaces and said what

891
00:46:24,300 --> 00:46:24,830
kind

892
00:46:24,830 --> 00:46:28,130
negative tone I what up to here why you
think that is

893
00:46:28,130 --> 00:46:32,100
case I don't think it's in a town are I
think this is a hacker conference

894
00:46:32,100 --> 00:46:35,360
and I think to talk about arm

895
00:46:35,360 --> 00:46:38,180
to talk about building project I don't
care what it is as long as you're not

896
00:46:38,180 --> 00:46:39,370
hurting someone is

897
00:46:39,370 --> 00:46:42,730
serve and had a mentality to be late
this is gray hat this gets a little

898
00:46:42,730 --> 00:46:45,970
sketchy but I'm gonna do it anyway
because instigating a sacrament Ellie

899
00:46:45,970 --> 00:46:49,140
I think they may commit ellen is more
like ok im any accessibility like we

900
00:46:49,140 --> 00:46:50,790
need understandability for this

901
00:46:50,790 --> 00:46:54,830
and the make and model is more like okay
you know you need to build your closet

902
00:46:54,830 --> 00:46:58,500
thing but then you need to also document
it well and posted online and

903
00:46:58,500 --> 00:47:01,800
care about not that you found those
eight other people in the US that

904
00:47:01,800 --> 00:47:03,690
understand is projecting in Fiji back

905
00:47:03,690 --> 00:47:07,800
but care about like how many hits that I
get from getting this person to make see

906
00:47:07,800 --> 00:47:11,520
on I think it's cool I i frankly think
both models are inching arm

907
00:47:11,520 --> 00:47:17,520
I just think its a shift from one South
a difference I'll

908
00:47:17,520 --> 00:47:21,190
so in this whole 3d printing world

909
00:47:21,190 --> 00:47:25,790
the biggest name that's like kinda have
paid attention to it is on a desk

910
00:47:25,790 --> 00:47:30,100
and their like trying to make tools that
are really accessible and really easy

911
00:47:30,100 --> 00:47:30,970
you

912
00:47:30,970 --> 00:47:34,990
use after for consumer market how do you
feel that like this

913
00:47:34,990 --> 00:47:39,130
arm large company kinda encroaching on
the

914
00:47:39,130 --> 00:47:42,150
packer maker 3d printing world

915
00:47:42,150 --> 00:47:45,160
is going to affect the open-source

916
00:47:45,160 --> 00:47:48,200
forwarding armed so I'm

917
00:47:48,200 --> 00:47:51,300
actually think it's absolutely right I
think we're recruiting into their world

918
00:47:51,300 --> 00:47:54,370
a yeah yet anyway they're coming back
yeah exactly

919
00:47:54,370 --> 00:47:57,960
and his image courtesy how how they
defend what they thought was their

920
00:47:57,960 --> 00:47:59,010
territory

921
00:47:59,010 --> 00:48:02,210
arm and a I don't

922
00:48:02,210 --> 00:48:05,780
arm I you know I'm 90% less

923
00:48:05,780 --> 00:48:09,220
I'm not going to say that open-source
programs are person fantastic and I can

924
00:48:09,220 --> 00:48:10,640
see that's the right thing to do

925
00:48:10,640 --> 00:48:14,660
arm I do think that especially in
software

926
00:48:14,660 --> 00:48:18,210
you can accumulate the eventual its
source and in a way that

927
00:48:18,210 --> 00:48:21,480
you don't have to pay as many salaries
you have as much for answers

928
00:48:21,480 --> 00:48:24,910
open source can slowly creep into an
area and it doesn't have to win it

929
00:48:24,910 --> 00:48:28,370
it just has 10 competition to you drive
innovation

930
00:48:28,370 --> 00:48:31,609
you know drive new ideas something on
the way

931
00:48:31,610 --> 00:48:35,320
I'm not and open source because like
open source wins OMG's

932
00:48:35,320 --> 00:48:38,700
whatever I mean officers because I see
what things like Mozilla has done

933
00:48:38,700 --> 00:48:41,680
getting the browser wars kickback of
getting your browser features

934
00:48:41,680 --> 00:48:45,390
I mean like most was ok oversee condo
where took a market that was a super

935
00:48:45,390 --> 00:48:46,279
monopoly

936
00:48:46,280 --> 00:48:49,730
and like just by being there in doing
something in trying

937
00:48:49,730 --> 00:48:52,610
brought brought the barrier of
accessibility brought the various

938
00:48:52,610 --> 00:48:54,340
features like mean everything better

939
00:48:54,340 --> 00:48:57,710
just by saying like hell yah huge
competition they're crazy

940
00:48:57,710 --> 00:49:01,250
there and keep working on this when they
were not so I think that

941
00:49:01,250 --> 00:49:04,490
arm I don't think Autodesk those
concerning away

942
00:49:04,490 --> 00:49:07,910
I think it'll become more accessible and
I think now that they're gonna have some

943
00:49:07,910 --> 00:49:12,890
some morning competition it'll force
them to be more fit in a lot of ways

944
00:49:12,890 --> 00:49:16,900
mice are seen as a giant dinosaur
ecosystem yet like Autodesk will it be

945
00:49:16,900 --> 00:49:20,340
you know big thing and handling his
little loss rafter open source

946
00:49:20,340 --> 00:49:23,700
like three pretty companies you have an
open s get over here and it's like a

947
00:49:23,700 --> 00:49:27,030
little triceratops it's got this big
thrill and what's chemical that

948
00:49:27,030 --> 00:49:30,180
its you know its will see just a big
Giles unfurl

949
00:49:30,180 --> 00:49:33,790
cuz open a skating in a chain cultural
I'm sorry I so

950
00:49:33,790 --> 00:49:37,440
you know it's an ecosystem and by having
a different players you end up making

951
00:49:37,440 --> 00:49:41,290
everything went better

952
00:49:41,290 --> 00:49:45,460
hi syrup related to the previous
question and you mention that it's up or

953
00:49:45,460 --> 00:49:46,220
s/n:

954
00:49:46,220 --> 00:49:50,490
milling supplementing suffer but where
do you think we are in terms of the

955
00:49:50,490 --> 00:49:53,540
cat and wrap things up for like

956
00:49:53,540 --> 00:49:57,140
what what's like that the most hopeful
predicting that

957
00:49:57,140 --> 00:50:00,759
in that respect for me to possible
project is open Icecat

958
00:50:00,760 --> 00:50:04,360
and trying to get people to like build
plugins an extent that

959
00:50:04,360 --> 00:50:08,740
home you know blunders awesome and
Boehner is a fantastic job but they're

960
00:50:08,740 --> 00:50:11,960
really more focused on the visual and

961
00:50:11,960 --> 00:50:15,020
you know making models from movies and
stuff I think there's a good shot that I

962
00:50:15,020 --> 00:50:16,079
think open Icecat

963
00:50:16,079 --> 00:50:19,900
has really good actually design a nap
are you wanna print in getting accurate

964
00:50:19,900 --> 00:50:21,599
enough that it's that is reusable

965
00:50:21,599 --> 00:50:25,380
arm and what you're missing I think that
there's also

966
00:50:25,380 --> 00:50:29,040
commercial software is gonna start
making that interface ladies here are

967
00:50:29,040 --> 00:50:32,240
but yeah sitting on the desk and and
Blender

968
00:50:32,240 --> 00:50:35,660
are the 2i think they're gonna be
software suffered

969
00:50:35,660 --> 00:50:42,660
utilities that in will make that more
accessible on in his views

970
00:50:45,960 --> 00:50:49,380
to get a rant that hopefully I'll coli
to a questionnaire I'm

971
00:50:49,380 --> 00:50:52,940
I wrote my first for TRENDnet in a
seventeen

972
00:50:52,940 --> 00:50:58,060
1971 or whatever Benson code: ever since
what the big disappointment to me has

973
00:50:58,060 --> 00:50:58,520
been

974
00:50:58,520 --> 00:51:02,380
have few tool how few tools we built for
sales

975
00:51:02,380 --> 00:51:06,770
MGM thirty or forty years ago suffered
but we have compilers now

976
00:51:06,770 --> 00:51:10,200
like yours while we're gone all the way
to work lifts and better

977
00:51:10,200 --> 00:51:14,570
debug versions over but it stalled there
what we end up building are

978
00:51:14,570 --> 00:51:17,750
software for other people in the margin
people on cell phones and as millions

979
00:51:17,750 --> 00:51:19,050
and millions about occasions

980
00:51:19,050 --> 00:51:22,510
but developers don't build things for
other developers am

981
00:51:22,510 --> 00:51:25,900
part of that is because nobody ever made
any money in this offer will

982
00:51:25,900 --> 00:51:29,410
building tool kits or lost on what I
think the

983
00:51:29,410 --> 00:51:33,009
and I think that's why this is taking so
long to answer your question

984
00:51:33,010 --> 00:51:36,590
but I also think that it's a reason it's
exploding because

985
00:51:36,590 --> 00:51:39,900
hackerspace is really printer channel
these are tools

986
00:51:39,900 --> 00:51:43,240
the people can use to go buildings and
there's a need for people

987
00:51:43,240 --> 00:51:46,390
innate desire to go build things bill

988
00:51:46,390 --> 00:51:49,960
keep building tools call it not the
color printer

989
00:51:49,960 --> 00:51:53,620
yeah i i different here than it

990
00:51:53,620 --> 00:51:57,170
how where we come from this room was
empty when it started

991
00:51:57,170 --> 00:52:02,910
up yeah I think that I am yeah I think
that that is a great point

992
00:52:02,910 --> 00:52:07,250
and I think that that's that's one other
is where be able to ramp up cool

993
00:52:07,250 --> 00:52:11,690
anybody else wanna go to mike in Tommy
anything

994
00:52:11,690 --> 00:52:15,480
questions answers cool

995
00:52:15,480 --> 00:52:19,480
II me get outta here on thanks for
putting up with me saying he ranting

996
00:52:19,480 --> 00:52:24,520
I have cookies everyone to cook economic
get one if your blood sugar back up

997
00:52:24,520 --> 00:52:29,700
there
