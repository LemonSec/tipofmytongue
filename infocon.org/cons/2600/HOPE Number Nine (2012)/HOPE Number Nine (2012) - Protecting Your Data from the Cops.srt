1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:03,409
and thanks for coming and I'm really
excited to be here today

2
00:00:03,409 --> 00:00:07,259
and Marcia Hofmann I'm with the
Electronic Frontier Foundation

3
00:00:07,259 --> 00:00:11,690
and the the inspiration for this talk

4
00:00:11,690 --> 00:00:14,889
actually was a for me the last hope

5
00:00:14,889 --> 00:00:18,100
which was one I it was not an

6
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:21,380
I was not here for but how many if you
were here for that

7
00:00:21,380 --> 00:00:24,609
the last one okay so I'm sure as

8
00:00:24,609 --> 00:00:28,250
allotted you know a joyous times was
supposed to give

9
00:00:28,250 --> 00:00:31,400
a keynote at that conference and he

10
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:35,110
wasn't able to come and so Jake upon

11
00:00:35,110 --> 00:00:38,210
gave a talk in his place and for

12
00:00:38,210 --> 00:00:41,489
quite some time after that it J

13
00:00:41,489 --> 00:00:45,820
got a lot of hassle and and you know i i

14
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:49,480
I think that partly based on on the fact
that their

15
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:53,610
is an ongoing criminal investigation
into WikiLeaks and partly based on the

16
00:00:53,610 --> 00:00:54,379
fact that

17
00:00:54,379 --> 00:00:57,949
there's a lot of investigative activity
in in prosecution activity

18
00:00:57,949 --> 00:01:01,180
around anonymous related things I

19
00:01:01,180 --> 00:01:04,199
have gotten a sense over a period of
time that there are a lot of people in

20
00:01:04,199 --> 00:01:05,059
this community

21
00:01:05,059 --> 00:01:08,110
they're nervous and they're not nervous

22
00:01:08,110 --> 00:01:11,830
because they done anything wrong but
they're nervous because they feel like

23
00:01:11,830 --> 00:01:15,270
they might be of interest to the police
because their part in this community

24
00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:19,039
and so I wanted to talk about

25
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:22,200
what happens when the police wanna talk
to you

26
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:26,500
are what happens when they want to sees
your computer's

27
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:29,619
or they want to seek information about
you from service provider

28
00:01:29,619 --> 00:01:33,180
and so what we're gonna start off
talking about today

29
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:37,780
his first ball your legal rights when
your computer or

30
00:01:37,780 --> 00:01:40,909
other device but is seized

31
00:01:40,909 --> 00:01:44,520
a and/or searched by police what that
means for you

32
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:48,140
then I'm gonna talk about your legal
rights when the police seek data that

33
00:01:48,140 --> 00:01:50,250
you from third-party service providers
like

34
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:53,460
Twitter or Google or Dropbox

35
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:58,030
a or any other company out there that
has stated that you store with an

36
00:01:58,030 --> 00:02:02,420
the real we're going to talk a little
bit about interactions with the police

37
00:02:02,420 --> 00:02:05,659
and you know when they want to speak
with you

38
00:02:05,659 --> 00:02:09,099
what does that mean and do you have to
answer their questions

39
00:02:09,098 --> 00:02:12,170
do not have to answer their questions
how you behave with them

40
00:02:12,170 --> 00:02:16,819
and then related to that I'm gonna speak
briefly but not a whole lot

41
00:02:16,819 --> 00:02:20,670
about the the Fifth Amendment privilege
against self-incrimination

42
00:02:20,670 --> 00:02:25,550
particularly if the government tries to
to force you to disclose passwords

43
00:02:25,550 --> 00:02:28,780
or encryption passphrase is or decrease
did

44
00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:33,420
versions and data so I need to start off
by getting a

45
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:37,160
standard display I'm sorry I'm aware you
know how it is

46
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:40,340
this is now legal advice this is legal
information

47
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:43,690
if you have particular questions about
your particular situation you should

48
00:02:43,690 --> 00:02:46,989
speak with a lawyer about that and as
that

49
00:02:46,989 --> 00:02:51,769
my colleague candy factory did you spend
a penny this is my colleague Haney

50
00:02:51,769 --> 00:02:56,930
and

51
00:02:56,930 --> 00:03:01,220
he's been with us for a little bit over
a year and before he came to if that he

52
00:03:01,220 --> 00:03:04,790
on what he'd be practice criminal
defense he was a

53
00:03:04,790 --> 00:03:08,620
a federal defender and so and I am here
Haney's here

54
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:12,740
and feel free to come talk to us and we
are happy to chat with you

55
00:03:12,740 --> 00:03:16,520
and you should also feel free to contact
the FF in the future and we're happy to

56
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:17,150
chat with you

57
00:03:17,150 --> 00:03:21,910
and if we at figure out this on our
conversation that we can help you out or

58
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:23,579
not the best people to help you out
because

59
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:26,860
somebody else as their expertise in an
issue we will try to find you someone to

60
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:27,310
talk to

61
00:03:27,310 --> 00:03:30,760
cell ok at first all searches and
seizures

62
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:33,959
have computers and the data on so

63
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:37,750
for purposes of this party talk let's
think a scenario

64
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:41,080
where a a policeman shows up at your
door

65
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:44,140
and says I have a warrant

66
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:48,770
to do a search here so what is the
constitutional right

67
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:51,770
that comes into play it's the fourth
amendment

68
00:03:51,770 --> 00:03:55,860
the Fourth Amendment protects us against
unreasonable searches and seizures

69
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:59,000
by the government so

70
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,350
what it says very specifically is that

71
00:04:02,350 --> 00:04:05,299
it protects the right of the people to
be secure in their persons houses papers

72
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:06,280
and effects

73
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:10,020
against unreasonable searches and
seizures and Caesars by the government

74
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:14,120
and something that's a little bit
difficult in this day in age is

75
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:17,739
is the fact that course this this
constitutional amendment was written a

76
00:04:17,739 --> 00:04:18,940
really long time ago

77
00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:23,090
and you know they were really thinking
about things like d.a

78
00:04:23,090 --> 00:04:26,460
and and so courts have really struggled

79
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:29,539
in this day in age to figure out how
this constitutional amendment

80
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:32,860
and appliance considering that you know

81
00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:36,350
when originally conceived and it was
supposed to

82
00:04:36,350 --> 00:04:40,330
you know protect your rights to be
secure in your

83
00:04:40,330 --> 00:04:43,849
physical person that the first base for
you lived

84
00:04:43,850 --> 00:04:47,220
and the things that you had which of
course did not include such

85
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:50,670
such issue no such things as data so

86
00:04:50,670 --> 00:04:54,590
and this is actually very interesting
constitutional a minute to talk about

87
00:04:54,590 --> 00:04:55,380
right now because

88
00:04:55,380 --> 00:04:58,710
on the general basic test has

89
00:04:58,710 --> 00:05:02,820
a changed a little bit just within the
past few months the Supreme Court

90
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:06,240
decided a case called the United States
versus Jones which is this this kinda

91
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:06,800
big

92
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:10,950
landmark case it's something you saw the
ACLU stop

93
00:05:10,950 --> 00:05:14,860
last night you I'm hurt a little bit
about that case I I suspect anne's

94
00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:18,880
talk tomorrow he will be talking about
and quite a bit I was a case

95
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:22,000
and looking at the question of whether
the police

96
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,610
ahead have to get a warrant before
attaching it

97
00:05:25,610 --> 00:05:29,640
GPS device to a car and then tracking a
person

98
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:34,000
over a period have at 28 days and the
government said that

99
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,479
as it as a general matter that counts as
a fourth amendment search

100
00:05:37,479 --> 00:05:40,490
but left open the question have whether

101
00:05:40,490 --> 00:05:44,130
you know above what kinda search would
be unreasonable and I kinda situation

102
00:05:44,130 --> 00:05:44,840
remember that

103
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:48,729
the 4th min: only protects against
unreasonable searches and seizures

104
00:05:48,729 --> 00:05:52,219
okay so but here's the basic test as

105
00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:55,680
as explained by the Supreme Court
recently United and United States versus

106
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:56,229
Jones

107
00:05:56,229 --> 00:06:00,940
the first thing we ask is number one is
the government physically intruding on a

108
00:06:00,940 --> 00:06:03,010
person's property to gather information

109
00:06:03,010 --> 00:06:08,740
the second question is does the person
having a reasonable expectation of

110
00:06:08,740 --> 00:06:09,710
privacy

111
00:06:09,710 --> 00:06:13,169
in the place to be searched where the
things to be seized

112
00:06:13,169 --> 00:06:18,630
now this this concept at the reasonable
expectation up right of privacy is

113
00:06:18,630 --> 00:06:20,300
something we're going to talk about
quite a bit

114
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:24,660
and when I use that term I mean

115
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:28,320
to specific things the first is did the
person

116
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:32,780
actually subjectively believed that he
or she had a reasonable expectation

117
00:06:32,780 --> 00:06:33,780
prices

118
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:38,350
privacy and the more objectively is that
an expectation that society would

119
00:06:38,350 --> 00:06:42,080
generally recognizes reasonable so keep
both those things in mind

120
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:45,190
now if the answer to either

121
00:06:45,190 --> 00:06:49,490
these questions is yes then

122
00:06:49,490 --> 00:06:52,570
generally the police have to get a
warrant

123
00:06:52,570 --> 00:06:56,640
based on probable cause and

124
00:06:56,640 --> 00:07:02,190
a judge has to approve it what does
probable cause mean

125
00:07:02,190 --> 00:07:07,810
so as it as a general matter I would
describe that term is meaning

126
00:07:07,810 --> 00:07:11,290
if on a reasonable person

127
00:07:11,290 --> 00:07:15,260
looked at the fax and it

128
00:07:15,260 --> 00:07:18,590
then that person would believe that it
is more likely than not

129
00:07:18,590 --> 00:07:21,960
that evidence of a crime is going to be
found there

130
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:26,370
okay and so what the police do is they
explain the fact that they know to a

131
00:07:26,370 --> 00:07:27,200
judge

132
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:29,890
and they say based on what we see here
we think we're gonna find evidence of a

133
00:07:29,890 --> 00:07:30,800
crime

134
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:35,010
and if the judge agrees then the warrant
issues

135
00:07:35,010 --> 00:07:39,810
and then they have authority to go
conduct that search

136
00:07:39,810 --> 00:07:44,550
and now the warrant asked to describe
with reasonable particularity

137
00:07:44,550 --> 00:07:49,099
the places to be searched and the things
to be seized and if there's a warrant

138
00:07:49,099 --> 00:07:53,610
you and it affects effects your space
your things you have the right to see it

139
00:07:53,610 --> 00:07:57,060
and so you will be able to know what
they

140
00:07:57,060 --> 00:08:00,070
are authorized to search and

141
00:08:00,070 --> 00:08:03,289
you know if you're in a situation where
you are

142
00:08:03,289 --> 00:08:06,770
having a search conducted up your things
you know you should take note and make

143
00:08:06,770 --> 00:08:07,630
sure that

144
00:08:07,630 --> 00:08:11,349
and you know the things that they are
searching in the places they are going

145
00:08:11,349 --> 00:08:14,710
and don't glad the bounds and that
warrant

146
00:08:14,710 --> 00:08:18,740
now if they do you got it down to the
warrant but you should not interfere

147
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:19,710
with that

148
00:08:19,710 --> 00:08:23,680
by any means you should I interfere with
the search but you should just take note

149
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:27,469
and make sure that you have the
identifying information the officers

150
00:08:27,469 --> 00:08:31,860
and and then you would want to talk to a
lawyer about that alright

151
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:35,650
and if they at searchers stuff

152
00:08:35,650 --> 00:08:38,789
and they take something that you might
also want to talk to a lawyer leader

153
00:08:38,789 --> 00:08:41,990
about the possibility of filing a motion
for return a property

154
00:08:41,990 --> 00:08:46,190
that's the way you get your stuff back
now

155
00:08:46,190 --> 00:08:51,240
sometimes there are circumstances where
the police don't have to get a warrant

156
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:55,250
to perform a search and

157
00:08:55,250 --> 00:08:58,330
and this is not by any means an
exclusive

158
00:08:58,330 --> 00:09:01,330
RIII completely and complete list

159
00:09:01,330 --> 00:09:04,700
have all those exceptions but the ones I
think

160
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:07,830
a are important for purposes in this
conversation include

161
00:09:07,830 --> 00:09:10,880
consent if they ask you they can we do
this

162
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:13,990
and you say oh yeah that's fine in a can
you need a warrant

163
00:09:13,990 --> 00:09:18,320
there there'll outsell and you know keep
that in mind if you're ever in a

164
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:20,920
circumstance where you're dealing with
the police

165
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:24,650
you if the if they ask you to and

166
00:09:24,650 --> 00:09:29,650
consent to a search of something and you
do not have to do that

167
00:09:29,650 --> 00:09:32,670
Plainview if they are in a place

168
00:09:32,670 --> 00:09:35,819
where you know their authorized to be
and

169
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:38,820
an easy something rate for their noses
thats

170
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:41,900
evidence of a crime something different
then

171
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:45,610
they don't have to look the other way in
a can vacancies that to you

172
00:09:45,610 --> 00:09:48,710
so for example if they come to a house

173
00:09:48,710 --> 00:09:51,880
and there there searching for evidence

174
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:56,550
a a burglary and then when they walk
into the house

175
00:09:56,550 --> 00:09:59,690
they see cocaine on the table in front
of them then

176
00:09:59,690 --> 00:10:02,880
you know that's thats that's okay don't
need a warrant

177
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:06,660
to to seize that there is an automobile

178
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:09,839
exception so if you are driving
somewhere

179
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:13,230
and they pull you over and they have
probable cause to think there's evidence

180
00:10:13,230 --> 00:10:14,720
of a crime in your car

181
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:18,620
they don't have to go get a warrant then
to come back and search it

182
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:22,340
and that the general reason for that is
because you know cars can

183
00:10:22,340 --> 00:10:26,110
can drive only very quickly and then you
know the evidence that a crime has gone

184
00:10:26,110 --> 00:10:29,190
basically so and they have evidence to
search the

185
00:10:29,190 --> 00:10:32,190
at the interior the car and containers
within it

186
00:10:32,190 --> 00:10:35,340
and and don't have to you don't want to
do that

187
00:10:35,340 --> 00:10:39,110
and then there's exigent circumstances
if they have reason to think

188
00:10:39,110 --> 00:10:42,920
that if they take the time to get a
warrant the evidence at the crime is

189
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:44,400
just going to evaporate

190
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:48,800
because somebody's going to destroy it
or the person's going to run away

191
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:53,779
or whatever then they don't have to get
a warrant

192
00:10:53,779 --> 00:10:57,710
now there's and a concept also known as
a Terry stop

193
00:10:57,710 --> 00:11:00,930
which I'm gonna talk about again a
little bit later I want you to know

194
00:11:00,930 --> 00:11:02,700
about it a bit now

195
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:07,560
and if they have a reasonable suspicion

196
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:12,210
that there's some criminal thing going
on but it doesn't rise to the level of

197
00:11:12,210 --> 00:11:13,700
probable cause

198
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:17,750
they can briefly detained somebody and
if they think that person might have a

199
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:19,630
weapon or something they can pat down

200
00:11:19,630 --> 00:11:23,640
that person's clothing and you know to
make sure they're not in any danger

201
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:27,870
or or anything and then they can you
know take that opportunity that brief

202
00:11:27,870 --> 00:11:31,520
detention to to try to get a better
handle on the situation

203
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:35,520
which sometimes me we need to use a
higher standard of probable cause

204
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:39,010
and or sometimes it means that they
learn that their initial suspicions were

205
00:11:39,010 --> 00:11:39,450
wrong

206
00:11:39,450 --> 00:11:43,570
and then the whole thing's over and and
the other thing too

207
00:11:43,570 --> 00:11:48,310
be aware of the search incident to
arrest if they arrest you for something

208
00:11:48,310 --> 00:11:51,320
and they are allowed to search and a

209
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:55,250
your your your percent and you know the
things that you

210
00:11:55,250 --> 00:11:59,620
have with you as a general matter and

211
00:11:59,620 --> 00:12:03,010
a special note about cell phones

212
00:12:03,010 --> 00:12:07,460
now several actually a bunch reports now

213
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:10,870
have look at the question I have you
know if you're arrested you have a cell

214
00:12:10,870 --> 00:12:11,760
phone in your pocket

215
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:14,770
or cell phone in your purse and

216
00:12:14,770 --> 00:12:18,780
can they search the cell phone without a
warrant or do they have to

217
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:23,089
then delaying and get a warrant to
connect answers the phone

218
00:12:23,090 --> 00:12:26,780
and and with the courts have said is
that

219
00:12:26,780 --> 00:12:30,689
at you have somewhere to said well they
can search that so incident to arrest

220
00:12:30,690 --> 00:12:34,450
because you know our cases generally say
that they can patch it down and they can

221
00:12:34,450 --> 00:12:35,680
search your pockets and

222
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:39,350
whatever you have on your on your person
so your cell phone is

223
00:12:39,350 --> 00:12:42,420
you know want those items the name they
can search it

224
00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:46,000
and other person said well that's all
phones are are are very special

225
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,500
because they contain a tremendous amount
of information and and

226
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:55,190
you know there maybe nothing vaguely
even relevant to the crime on that phone

227
00:12:55,190 --> 00:12:58,350
and in fact that's and you know it's
likely that there's going to be a lot

228
00:12:58,350 --> 00:13:02,650
it's not relevant and it's going to be
highly invasive so they have to warn

229
00:13:02,650 --> 00:13:07,490
on there was a case in california the
Supreme Court California and in

230
00:13:07,490 --> 00:13:09,150
california versus D is

231
00:13:09,150 --> 00:13:13,010
ruled that but no warrant is necessary
to search your phone

232
00:13:13,010 --> 00:13:17,430
incident to arrest and that opinion
suggested very strongly that that

233
00:13:17,430 --> 00:13:20,710
wouldn't be limited to phones that would
apply also to say laptops

234
00:13:20,710 --> 00:13:23,860
a or other digital devices that that you
might have

235
00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:27,430
and the Supreme Court have Ohio looking
at the same question

236
00:13:27,430 --> 00:13:30,650
went the other way so this is something
that's very much

237
00:13:30,650 --> 00:13:33,850
influx but you know the rule a

238
00:13:33,850 --> 00:13:37,450
for you is going to depend heavily upon
where you live

239
00:13:37,450 --> 00:13:40,540
and where you are and so if it's
something you're

240
00:13:40,540 --> 00:13:43,949
you're concerned about you know it's
worth knowing about an and you know

241
00:13:43,950 --> 00:13:48,340
looking into okay so

242
00:13:48,340 --> 00:13:52,110
but in terms of a this particular
situation you're having a cell phone

243
00:13:52,110 --> 00:13:53,010
with you

244
00:13:53,010 --> 00:13:56,100
and you know the possibility that

245
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:59,690
that in my PE as searched if you get
arrested

246
00:13:59,690 --> 00:14:03,440
what can you do about that if you have a
situation

247
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:06,780
if you have reason to think that you are
going to be in a situation where you

248
00:14:06,780 --> 00:14:08,030
might get arrested

249
00:14:08,030 --> 00:14:11,980
for example you're protesting and you
think it might get potentially

250
00:14:11,980 --> 00:14:15,230
you know contentious or whatever and
consider

251
00:14:15,230 --> 00:14:19,480
not having your own with you or any
mobile device consider leaving at Homer

252
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:23,770
leaving it with a friend and also backup
your data

253
00:14:23,770 --> 00:14:28,290
and I think you probably wanna make sure
that you're not in a situation where

254
00:14:28,290 --> 00:14:31,439
at your phone get seized you lose all
the stuff on it

255
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:34,650
and password protect your data

256
00:14:34,650 --> 00:14:38,980
if you use a password lock and that is a
pretty good indication that you have a

257
00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:41,400
reasonable expectation of privacy

258
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:45,710
in your phone and that is a fact that
may make a difference

259
00:14:45,710 --> 00:14:50,550
if you were an if your situation gets
before Judge

260
00:14:50,550 --> 00:14:54,960
and if if it's possible and encrypt the
data on your device is

261
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:59,510
full disk encryption is preferable and
how many are you use and read

262
00:14:59,510 --> 00:15:03,270
based devices of course

263
00:15:03,270 --> 00:15:07,420
tablets okay alright well and how many
of you are familiar with

264
00:15:07,420 --> 00:15:11,060
Moxie Marlin spike in whisper systems

265
00:15:11,060 --> 00:15:16,030
fewer but a lot okay well and

266
00:15:16,030 --> 00:15:19,370
how many people have seen the source
code okay that's fair

267
00:15:19,370 --> 00:15:22,770
that's fair but you know I am not aware

268
00:15:22,770 --> 00:15:27,260
many options out there for you know for
full disk encryption on phones but

269
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:31,250
at was persistent whisper systems has
actually produced one

270
00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:35,210
so that's something it is not available
right now unfortunately

271
00:15:35,210 --> 00:15:39,680
and because and whisper systems as been
purchased by

272
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:42,760
Twitter and you know sir the

273
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:46,360
the status that and company's products
are

274
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:50,690
your kind in flux at the moment and but
actually was Persistent Systems has

275
00:15:50,690 --> 00:15:52,090
produced a whole suite

276
00:15:52,090 --> 00:15:56,060
a encryption and programs for

277
00:15:56,060 --> 00:15:59,180
for Android phones so it's worth looking
at

278
00:15:59,180 --> 00:16:03,250
if you're interested in keeping an eye
on I'm on when senators things come back

279
00:16:03,250 --> 00:16:06,460
and in into and into use

280
00:16:06,460 --> 00:16:11,310
text secure is one of them and that that
actually is available right now for

281
00:16:11,310 --> 00:16:14,590
for anybody who wants to download it and
use it in and you know thats

282
00:16:14,590 --> 00:16:18,600
thats certainly worth knowing about okay
so

283
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:21,700
Fourth Amendment special case the border

284
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:25,340
and the fourth amendment technically
applies

285
00:16:25,340 --> 00:16:29,440
at the border but olive be a search is
that are done they're

286
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:33,420
at are pretty much just considered
reasonable

287
00:16:33,420 --> 00:16:37,570
because the at the fact that there at
the border and the reason that that is

288
00:16:37,570 --> 00:16:40,050
the case is because the person said well

289
00:16:40,050 --> 00:16:43,320
you know the government has a very
special interest in making sure that and

290
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:44,880
you know that stuff doesn't come

291
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:48,480
into the country and so they can search

292
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:51,820
they can search step in a pretty much
willy nilly at the border

293
00:16:51,820 --> 00:16:55,920
and for the most part no suspicion of
wrongdoing whatsoever

294
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:59,140
is needed for searches and

295
00:16:59,140 --> 00:17:02,140
pretty much anything at the border
except for

296
00:17:02,140 --> 00:17:06,669
and you know basically a search have you
know the interior other persons

297
00:17:06,669 --> 00:17:10,049
you nobody you know these suspect that
you have

298
00:17:10,049 --> 00:17:13,939
you get your that your smuggling drugs
or something and in that case they need

299
00:17:13,939 --> 00:17:16,959
reasonable suspicion which still isn't
even probable cause

300
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:20,970
but at this point the courts
unfortunately are are pretty uniform in

301
00:17:20,970 --> 00:17:22,100
saying that

302
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:26,839
and searching an electronic device at
the border is just routine thing

303
00:17:26,839 --> 00:17:30,270
and no suspicion of wrongdoing is needed
if the government wanted to they can

304
00:17:30,270 --> 00:17:30,730
search

305
00:17:30,730 --> 00:17:33,890
every electronic device that comes
across the border but they just kinda

306
00:17:33,890 --> 00:17:36,909
don't have the resources to do that

307
00:17:36,909 --> 00:17:41,010
if you're interested in this topic and
yet that has a white people on it

308
00:17:41,010 --> 00:17:45,100
a defending Grey to see at the US border
you can download it here

309
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:48,549
and you know that the back to the matter
is the legal protections are very strong

310
00:17:48,549 --> 00:17:49,400
and so

311
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:53,840
and if you are planning to carry a
computer or a phone or any other device

312
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:55,059
across the border

313
00:17:55,059 --> 00:17:58,299
because you need it for work or whatever
there are you know certain technical

314
00:17:58,299 --> 00:17:59,020
measures

315
00:17:59,020 --> 00:18:02,850
and I think common sense measures that
you can take to protect your data

316
00:18:02,850 --> 00:18:06,199
considering that the legal protections
are very good so you know check that out

317
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:08,850
if you're interested in this topic

318
00:18:08,850 --> 00:18:12,110
and you know in short what can you do
with the border

319
00:18:12,110 --> 00:18:15,570
and try to carry is little data as
possible

320
00:18:15,570 --> 00:18:18,960
and don't take the stuff you don't need
to take with you

321
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:22,289
and to make that happen sometimes

322
00:18:22,289 --> 00:18:25,840
its it's good to think about having a
special laptop or a special

323
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:29,850
hard drive that you specifically for
travel you know her drive it you can

324
00:18:29,850 --> 00:18:31,140
just kinda swapping

325
00:18:31,140 --> 00:18:34,610
quickly if you if you have to take a
computer that lets you do that easily

326
00:18:34,610 --> 00:18:37,760
and that just really have minimal date
on it just you know that the pair

327
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:42,059
minimum and you remember to you backup
your data

328
00:18:42,059 --> 00:18:46,690
and he's your your devices seized and
and also consider just storing your data

329
00:18:46,690 --> 00:18:48,030
in the cloud somewhere

330
00:18:48,030 --> 00:18:51,139
taking a blank device with you in just
downloading it when you get to your

331
00:18:51,140 --> 00:18:52,960
destination

332
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:56,500
and passwords and encryption and

333
00:18:56,500 --> 00:19:00,640
of course and these things are helpful
encryption is

334
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:04,419
full disk encryption is the best option
password protection

335
00:19:04,419 --> 00:19:08,130
is not a fantastic a precaution but

336
00:19:08,130 --> 00:19:11,559
it's better than nothing you know using
these things in conjunction can be

337
00:19:11,559 --> 00:19:12,740
helpful

338
00:19:12,740 --> 00:19:15,890
and if you want more detail about the
border stuff I I refer you into the

339
00:19:15,890 --> 00:19:18,260
paper we got a lot of good stuff in
there

340
00:19:18,260 --> 00:19:21,520
okay September 2 police efforts to get
your data from

341
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:25,289
third-party service providers I know the
fact of the matter is there's not a

342
00:19:25,289 --> 00:19:25,919
whole lot that

343
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:29,330
you can do about that if they decide to
try to do it but I wanted to

344
00:19:29,330 --> 00:19:32,428
to talk about it because there's been
some high profile cases along these

345
00:19:32,429 --> 00:19:33,690
lines

346
00:19:33,690 --> 00:19:37,490
so the way that the law applies to the
situation is actually

347
00:19:37,490 --> 00:19:40,820
really complex and confusing in the
courts RR

348
00:19:40,820 --> 00:19:44,200
are in the midst of just trying to sort
it all out

349
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:47,539
the first question is how the fourth and
then applies right do you have a fourth

350
00:19:47,539 --> 00:19:48,610
and an interest

351
00:19:48,610 --> 00:19:52,520
in your data stored with third-party
providers

352
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:57,120
now there is a very troubling doctrine
out there

353
00:19:57,120 --> 00:20:01,509
that comes from a couple other all
Supreme Court cases

354
00:20:01,509 --> 00:20:04,940
a that and you know we're not decided

355
00:20:04,940 --> 00:20:09,720
at a time when the use of computers was
so widespread

356
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:13,240
but basically this doctrine and says
that

357
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:16,879
people don't have any reasonable
expectation of privacy

358
00:20:16,879 --> 00:20:20,279
in information they voluntarily disclose

359
00:20:20,279 --> 00:20:23,970
to someone else you know the idea being
that it really was prayed that you would

360
00:20:23,970 --> 00:20:24,850
know

361
00:20:24,850 --> 00:20:29,419
needed available to anybody else and and
if you have no reasonable expectation of

362
00:20:29,419 --> 00:20:31,080
privacy then

363
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:34,210
and you know that its it's basically not
a fourth man a problem

364
00:20:34,210 --> 00:20:39,289
and and the please don't have to get a
warrant if that is true

365
00:20:39,289 --> 00:20:42,340
in the information age think about what
that means

366
00:20:42,340 --> 00:20:45,539
for your Gmail account for

367
00:20:45,539 --> 00:20:48,789
the things that you store in Dropbox

368
00:20:48,789 --> 00:20:53,230
I in the Dropbox Service or any other
third party service Nena

369
00:20:53,230 --> 00:20:56,529
everybody almost everybody is moving in
that direction I mean

370
00:20:56,529 --> 00:20:59,720
that is a rule that is going to cause a
lot of problems

371
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:04,429
if it if it stays now some other ports
recognizing this

372
00:21:04,429 --> 00:21:08,549
and a couple years ago there was a case
called United States forces were Shack

373
00:21:08,549 --> 00:21:13,389
and if that was involved in this case we
filed an amicus brief

374
00:21:13,389 --> 00:21:17,820
and it is rich reach the Sixth Circuit
Court of Appeals which is a pretty high

375
00:21:17,820 --> 00:21:18,450
level

376
00:21:18,450 --> 00:21:22,279
court and you know their district court
appeals court and the Supreme Court

377
00:21:22,279 --> 00:21:22,820
Services

378
00:21:22,820 --> 00:21:25,928
you know appeals court and that court
found that

379
00:21:25,929 --> 00:21:29,720
people do you have a reasonable
expectation of privacy email stored with

380
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:34,159
at third-party providers so that is and
a very good result

381
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:37,830
and we hope to see that expanded
certainly that doesn't align

382
00:21:37,830 --> 00:21:42,570
with a third party doctrine and we hope
that's kinda the first strike against it

383
00:21:42,570 --> 00:21:46,049
another encouraging thing is that in
United States verses Jones which I

384
00:21:46,049 --> 00:21:47,690
mentioned earlier

385
00:21:47,690 --> 00:21:51,240
at one of the justices a filed a
separate

386
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:55,279
opinion and in which each you talked
about a number of things that one of

387
00:21:55,279 --> 00:21:55,840
them was

388
00:21:55,840 --> 00:22:00,259
you know she expressed a lot of concern
about this idea that he store data with

389
00:22:00,259 --> 00:22:03,639
with some somebody else you don't have
to any reasonable expectation of privacy

390
00:22:03,639 --> 00:22:04,240
in it so

391
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:07,870
and this is really an exciting idea

392
00:22:07,870 --> 00:22:12,210
that suggest perhaps that and you know
at least one supreme court and perhaps

393
00:22:12,210 --> 00:22:17,809
a others have been remembers me and you
recognize the situation here and be

394
00:22:17,809 --> 00:22:19,158
willing overtime

395
00:22:19,159 --> 00:22:22,480
to ahead change that the way the law is
going

396
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:26,440
in that direction and but as promising
as that is

397
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:29,789
it's going to take a long time for that
to happen and legal process is a really

398
00:22:29,789 --> 00:22:34,350
slow unfortunately so aside from the
fourth amendment there are other things

399
00:22:34,350 --> 00:22:36,559
that complicate this question

400
00:22:36,559 --> 00:22:39,940
there is a federal law called the stored
Communications Act

401
00:22:39,940 --> 00:22:43,970
that and in general basically governs
the way that

402
00:22:43,970 --> 00:22:48,179
and third-party providers can disclose
information under

403
00:22:48,179 --> 00:22:51,249
certain circumstances and and it

404
00:22:51,249 --> 00:22:55,629
among other things regulates when law
enforcement can get

405
00:22:55,629 --> 00:22:59,440
and stored records from from third-party
providers

406
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:04,200
and the rules there are very detailed
and complicated but

407
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:07,529
you know I think that we can kinda boil
it down it to you

408
00:23:07,529 --> 00:23:11,440
21 you know three basic and ideas

409
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:16,009
the first one is that and if the record
involve content

410
00:23:16,009 --> 00:23:20,600
then it's protected more strongly then a
record that doesn't have content

411
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:24,409
and what i'm talking about content I
mean like you an email message

412
00:23:24,409 --> 00:23:27,710
you know something that really conveys
something and meaning

413
00:23:27,710 --> 00:23:31,649
and and and you know a person's thoughts

414
00:23:31,649 --> 00:23:35,320
and something substantive and non
content

415
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:39,918
might be and you know just basic
subscriber information

416
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:43,169
and an IP address at times

417
00:23:43,169 --> 00:23:48,809
you just information that would route
something from A to B

418
00:23:48,809 --> 00:23:52,009
a credit card number

419
00:23:52,009 --> 00:23:57,710
Rd near the century what kinda database

420
00:23:57,710 --> 00:24:04,710
well

421
00:24:07,429 --> 00:24:09,779
that's a good question and I'm not sure
what the answer is

422
00:24:09,779 --> 00:24:13,279
an let me let me mull that over a little
bit

423
00:24:13,279 --> 00:24:17,059
and huh that's interesting

424
00:24:17,059 --> 00:24:21,289
welcome back to that and what content
versus and you know I also think it's a

425
00:24:21,289 --> 00:24:22,629
little bit complicated because

426
00:24:22,629 --> 00:24:26,899
you know they're there are statutes out
there that that protect financial data

427
00:24:26,899 --> 00:24:30,739
in certain ways and I'm not sure how
they interact exactly what this

428
00:24:30,739 --> 00:24:35,470
so pardon PC and I'm sorry

429
00:24:35,470 --> 00:24:38,049
we're getting kinda sidetracked and
happy to talk with you about the stuff

430
00:24:38,049 --> 00:24:38,570
later

431
00:24:38,570 --> 00:24:43,559
on but I kinda person on content one
other things that we were in a quite a

432
00:24:43,559 --> 00:24:43,979
bit is

433
00:24:43,979 --> 00:24:47,139
what about things like location data
I'll

434
00:24:47,139 --> 00:24:50,940
to an IP address we think under certain
circumstances might be just

435
00:24:50,940 --> 00:24:54,669
routing information it maybe it's just
like an address but under other

436
00:24:54,669 --> 00:24:56,929
circumstances if you combine it with
other data

437
00:24:56,929 --> 00:25:01,590
where you have IP address is showing a a
person's connections to a service over

438
00:25:01,590 --> 00:25:02,269
time

439
00:25:02,269 --> 00:25:06,119
it might reveal a lot more about that
person's activities

440
00:25:06,119 --> 00:25:10,429
and at that point is that rise to a
level content we think it should

441
00:25:10,429 --> 00:25:14,210
another question is within the concept

442
00:25:14,210 --> 00:25:18,799
content how old is it as a general
matter if it's

443
00:25:18,799 --> 00:25:22,070
a 180 days old

444
00:25:22,070 --> 00:25:25,960
or or older than that then it is
protected

445
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:29,570
and and it that's protected less
strongly than if it's

446
00:25:29,570 --> 00:25:34,168
more recent than that and and the slow
actually only

447
00:25:34,169 --> 00:25:37,799
up applies to providers electronic
communication services or remote

448
00:25:37,799 --> 00:25:38,879
computing services

449
00:25:38,879 --> 00:25:42,099
and it is something that that is really
frustrating is that the stored

450
00:25:42,099 --> 00:25:44,168
Communications Act was written and
ninety-six

451
00:25:44,169 --> 00:25:47,369
and it's never really been substantially
updated

452
00:25:47,369 --> 00:25:52,109
and so you know I think that and
Congress was considering certain

453
00:25:52,109 --> 00:25:56,168
types of services at the time electronic
communication services okay

454
00:25:56,169 --> 00:25:59,190
these herbs services that to let people
communicate with each other

455
00:25:59,190 --> 00:26:00,159
electronically

456
00:26:00,159 --> 00:26:04,830
remote computing services and United
this tends to involve storage

457
00:26:04,830 --> 00:26:08,869
services that store data for people but
we have providers now that

458
00:26:08,869 --> 00:26:12,109
that do both of those things and you
know how do we

459
00:26:12,109 --> 00:26:15,989
how do we treat them in this statutory
scheme and so

460
00:26:15,989 --> 00:26:18,989
and the starts to get really complicated

461
00:26:18,989 --> 00:26:22,369
and it's funny you know when you
secretly and on this often

462
00:26:22,369 --> 00:26:25,509
the judges start out just my thing okay
this is really complicated

463
00:26:25,509 --> 00:26:28,809
you take my best stab at it but this is
hard and so

464
00:26:28,809 --> 00:26:31,710
you know number one the law needs to be
updated but in a number to it just

465
00:26:31,710 --> 00:26:34,399
doesn't apply very well to the situation
at the moment

466
00:26:34,399 --> 00:26:38,019
and then they're also state laws that
that play into this as well

467
00:26:38,019 --> 00:26:43,009
so very very difficult complicated
situation this stuff has come up in a

468
00:26:43,009 --> 00:26:45,019
couple recent cases that you may have
heard about

469
00:26:45,019 --> 00:26:48,869
one involved a a government order order
to Twitter

470
00:26:48,869 --> 00:26:51,929
seeking information about some
individuals

471
00:26:51,929 --> 00:26:56,369
in the WikiLeaks investigation and and
BFF represents

472
00:26:56,369 --> 00:26:59,570
a a person along with the ACLU in that

473
00:26:59,570 --> 00:27:04,149
case and 3 abusers our plan for getting
on starter

474
00:27:04,149 --> 00:27:09,700
and a couple on and rock country week we
challenged the order for

475
00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:12,879
non content data site by

476
00:27:12,879 --> 00:27:16,440
site by the government from Twitter in
the WikiLeaks investigation

477
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:21,149
and unfortunately it didn't go that well
and we need for them in arguments

478
00:27:21,149 --> 00:27:24,779
we need stored Communications Act
arguments we need first in arguments

479
00:27:24,779 --> 00:27:25,460
based on

480
00:27:25,460 --> 00:27:29,080
great Association and the court
basically said well

481
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:32,570
you know looking at all this we just
don't think that

482
00:27:32,570 --> 00:27:36,779
you have rights and this really so
that's just kinda how that goes

483
00:27:36,779 --> 00:27:39,909
you know another one was a New York
purses Harris

484
00:27:39,909 --> 00:27:43,529
a recent case here the involving an
Occupy Wall Street para protester

485
00:27:43,529 --> 00:27:47,210
who was and charged by the

486
00:27:47,210 --> 00:27:51,710
the police here with disorderly conduct
based on his participation

487
00:27:51,710 --> 00:27:54,950
and in a protest and

488
00:27:54,950 --> 00:27:58,210
the police sent a subpoena to Twitter

489
00:27:58,210 --> 00:28:01,629
trying to get information about and
mister harris's

490
00:28:01,629 --> 00:28:04,970
and activities on Twitter retreated 3

491
00:28:04,970 --> 00:28:08,450
three months and that included and
actual content

492
00:28:08,450 --> 00:28:13,169
tweets and it appears to have extended
also to direct messages so even private

493
00:28:13,169 --> 00:28:13,929
content

494
00:28:13,929 --> 00:28:17,379
and not not just content that's just out
there for for

495
00:28:17,379 --> 00:28:22,529
everybody to see and and mister harris
push back against those Twitter

496
00:28:22,529 --> 00:28:26,369
filed an a motion pushing back against
this and

497
00:28:26,369 --> 00:28:29,419
the ACLU and BFF in public citizen

498
00:28:29,419 --> 00:28:32,710
we join together to file an amicus to
support them

499
00:28:32,710 --> 00:28:35,820
but unfortunately in the court it

500
00:28:35,820 --> 00:28:38,359
didn't write he didn't recognize the
privacy interests in the way that we

501
00:28:38,359 --> 00:28:39,299
helped

502
00:28:39,299 --> 00:28:42,499
and so in a teaser these are fights that
we're a

503
00:28:42,499 --> 00:28:45,919
working on now in continuing to work on
and I think that that these are issues

504
00:28:45,919 --> 00:28:46,679
that

505
00:28:46,679 --> 00:28:49,690
organizations like ours already working
on for a long time

506
00:28:49,690 --> 00:28:53,200
this is one of our big battles in the
coming years is trying to show the

507
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:54,320
courts that

508
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:57,619
there are privacy interests and a to
start a third parties

509
00:28:57,619 --> 00:29:00,919
and that's important and

510
00:29:00,919 --> 00:29:04,320
we launched a cut campaign a couple
years ago called a

511
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:08,829
when the government comes knocking who
has your back and the idea was to

512
00:29:08,829 --> 00:29:12,809
a recognize certain companies who
actually have a good practices

513
00:29:12,809 --> 00:29:17,499
along these lines and I know you
probably can't see the categories very

514
00:29:17,499 --> 00:29:18,549
well

515
00:29:18,549 --> 00:29:23,470
but we I gave a various companies stars4

516
00:29:23,470 --> 00:29:26,749
telling users about the demands from the
government so

517
00:29:26,749 --> 00:29:30,289
you know when the government sends a

518
00:29:30,289 --> 00:29:33,639
dated a man to Twitter for example and
we

519
00:29:33,639 --> 00:29:36,899
room you know we gave him a star because
they have a policy of leading

520
00:29:36,899 --> 00:29:40,989
the customer know that so that the
that's right actually like push back

521
00:29:40,989 --> 00:29:41,999
against that

522
00:29:41,999 --> 00:29:46,099
and that bad can always be the case
unfortunately because sometimes they

523
00:29:46,099 --> 00:29:49,789
demand comes with a provision that says
you know this is sensitive and you can't

524
00:29:49,789 --> 00:29:53,649
tell anybody but you know to the extent
that and

525
00:29:53,649 --> 00:29:57,379
services are able to tell their
subscribers and

526
00:29:57,379 --> 00:30:01,320
there are as several that do you and we
also

527
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:04,599
give stars for on companies that are
transparent

528
00:30:04,599 --> 00:30:07,609
about government request their son their
increasing number companies that publish

529
00:30:07,609 --> 00:30:11,200
reports about this on an annual basis
that say how many requests they get what

530
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:13,159
kind request they get

531
00:30:13,159 --> 00:30:16,869
and me it stars are fighting for user
privacy in the courts

532
00:30:16,869 --> 00:30:20,460
and after fighting freezer privacy in
congress because as i mentioned some of

533
00:30:20,460 --> 00:30:23,229
these laws are really outdated and they
need to be improved

534
00:30:23,229 --> 00:30:27,570
I get an advance in technology so and
this is not a complete list

535
00:30:27,570 --> 00:30:31,210
a all of the companies that we on have
given stars to you

536
00:30:31,210 --> 00:30:34,169
but I encourage you to take a look at
that reports even get a sense of what

537
00:30:34,169 --> 00:30:34,919
the

538
00:30:34,919 --> 00:30:38,039
with the the practices at the various
companies are

539
00:30:38,039 --> 00:30:41,079
and I will tell you that some in the
best practices out there

540
00:30:41,079 --> 00:30:45,440
on are Twitter's and also a little ISP

541
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:48,749
in northern california called sonic
dotnet how many people are sonic

542
00:30:48,749 --> 00:30:49,579
customers

543
00:30:49,579 --> 00:30:53,428
here just a few at its on

544
00:30:53,429 --> 00:30:57,149
I give those guys a lot of credit so

545
00:30:57,149 --> 00:31:00,229
a lot of this is out of your hands
because you know we're talking about

546
00:31:00,229 --> 00:31:04,369
your data stored with other people but
what can you do

547
00:31:04,369 --> 00:31:08,289
so understand what data you're actually
disclosing the service providers and

548
00:31:08,289 --> 00:31:11,109
that they actually have and maintain

549
00:31:11,109 --> 00:31:14,309
and be selective about the services you
use because some of those companies have

550
00:31:14,309 --> 00:31:14,960
better

551
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:19,440
practices than others on if it's
possible if you're using a service where

552
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:21,769
you can encrypt data before you upload
it

553
00:31:21,769 --> 00:31:27,070
and and then you should do that it's
best to use a service that

554
00:31:27,070 --> 00:31:30,079
you know lets you encrypt the data
yourself and then upload it

555
00:31:30,079 --> 00:31:33,200
and rather than organizing their

556
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:36,309
designing their services in such a way
where they actually might be able to

557
00:31:36,309 --> 00:31:37,139
give the government

558
00:31:37,139 --> 00:31:41,369
information that would allow description
of that data

559
00:31:41,369 --> 00:31:45,879
and and as I mentioned before I feel
like the legal issues here are on

560
00:31:45,879 --> 00:31:49,289
are a are top

561
00:31:49,289 --> 00:31:52,408
and right now the law is not on our side
and so

562
00:31:52,409 --> 00:31:55,539
I think this is another area where
technical solutions

563
00:31:55,539 --> 00:31:58,570
on are a good idea

564
00:31:58,570 --> 00:32:02,899
and so keep an eye out for technical
solutions and build technical solutions

565
00:32:02,899 --> 00:32:05,960
and you know where we're going to do
what we can with the law but

566
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:10,169
a you had there was a few are actually
in a position to design

567
00:32:10,169 --> 00:32:14,999
good privacy enhancing protections for
data stored by third-party services

568
00:32:14,999 --> 00:32:19,669
that's all good stuff okay so briefly

569
00:32:19,669 --> 00:32:24,239
questioning a by law enforcement and
other interactions you may have with

570
00:32:24,239 --> 00:32:26,320
them

571
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:29,979
so

572
00:32:29,979 --> 00:32:33,739
let's take her arson area before with
the cop coming to the

573
00:32:33,739 --> 00:32:37,569
to your house with the warrant and

574
00:32:37,569 --> 00:32:41,099
you know as the the police are searching
your home

575
00:32:41,099 --> 00:32:44,529
a and/or you know seizing you are things

576
00:32:44,529 --> 00:32:48,099
they're asking you questions who here
thinks you have to answer those

577
00:32:48,099 --> 00:32:51,668
questions

578
00:32:51,669 --> 00:32:53,770
yeah okay

579
00:32:53,770 --> 00:32:57,120
you know that answers questions and in
fact and

580
00:32:57,120 --> 00:33:01,730
its best I think in your best interest
to try to speak to a lawyer before you

581
00:33:01,730 --> 00:33:03,530
answer any questions that they ask you

582
00:33:03,530 --> 00:33:06,830
okay let's say you're and protest

583
00:33:06,830 --> 00:33:09,870
and things are getting a little bit

584
00:33:09,870 --> 00:33:13,950
kind if he did in Weirton a a policeman
comes up to insert ask you questions

585
00:33:13,950 --> 00:33:18,760
proving to get answers questions okay

586
00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:22,670
awesome that's good and as a general
matter you don't have to answer the

587
00:33:22,670 --> 00:33:23,260
questions

588
00:33:23,260 --> 00:33:26,950
and their is a one little carry out
there

589
00:33:26,950 --> 00:33:31,100
which I'm going to talk about and out

590
00:33:31,100 --> 00:33:35,330
actually going to talk about that right
now on I gave an early version

591
00:33:35,330 --> 00:33:38,630
let's talk a few months ago I know is
bridge and people who is bridge

592
00:33:38,630 --> 00:33:42,350
are very smart nap great questions and
one person asked me

593
00:33:42,350 --> 00:33:46,920
well okay so you don't have to answer
questions but what if they ask you who

594
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:48,470
you are asking for ID

595
00:33:48,470 --> 00:33:51,940
yet to answer that question and here's
the deal

596
00:33:51,940 --> 00:33:55,240
there are some states about half the
seats out there

597
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:58,620
have statutes that's a that

598
00:33:58,620 --> 00:34:02,470
that if the police had some suspicion
that you're doing something wrong maybe

599
00:34:02,470 --> 00:34:05,380
it's not probable cause but it's
reasonable suspicion

600
00:34:05,380 --> 00:34:08,950
and they can ask you who you are and you
have to answer

601
00:34:08,949 --> 00:34:13,500
and if you don't that's against the law
now there was a Supreme Court case a few

602
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:14,409
years ago

603
00:34:14,409 --> 00:34:17,899
called a highball a purses

604
00:34:17,900 --> 00:34:21,080
a data and that

605
00:34:21,080 --> 00:34:24,150
a case said that and

606
00:34:24,150 --> 00:34:29,040
if you are in it he re stop situation
that is the police already have reason

607
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:29,710
to believe

608
00:34:29,710 --> 00:34:33,179
that you may have done something but you
know they're not sure

609
00:34:33,179 --> 00:34:37,089
but they think maybe and they can ask
you for

610
00:34:37,090 --> 00:34:40,310
they can ask you to identify yourself
and

611
00:34:40,310 --> 00:34:43,610
that that doesn't violate your fourth in
the rights and

612
00:34:43,610 --> 00:34:48,570
so a their two questions there a are you
in a state that has that law

613
00:34:48,570 --> 00:34:52,200
and be are unitary stop situation

614
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:55,580
and remember that means that you're
being temporarily detained

615
00:34:55,580 --> 00:34:59,819
meaning you're not free to walk away so
how do you know

616
00:34:59,820 --> 00:35:02,660
when you're in that situation anyway if
you're having a little bit at the moment

617
00:35:02,660 --> 00:35:04,470
with the police officer there

618
00:35:04,470 --> 00:35:07,550
and he asks you who you are any how do
you how do you know

619
00:35:07,550 --> 00:35:11,100
and what i was just as you ask in my
free to go

620
00:35:11,100 --> 00:35:14,770
and if he says no you have a Terry stop
situation

621
00:35:14,770 --> 00:35:18,190
and he says yes and you don't have to
answer the question you can walk away

622
00:35:18,190 --> 00:35:21,640
a kind another thing

623
00:35:21,640 --> 00:35:25,359
if they a are asking you for help

624
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:30,010
for example searching your computer or
finding things in your home

625
00:35:30,010 --> 00:35:33,430
you don't have to help them and remember
that consent

626
00:35:33,430 --> 00:35:36,700
is one of those exceptions to the fourth
amendment and so

627
00:35:36,700 --> 00:35:40,360
it may very well be in your best
interest not to help even if you feel

628
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:41,580
like you're being impolite

629
00:35:41,580 --> 00:35:44,610
are difficult and your concerned about
causing a difficult

630
00:35:44,610 --> 00:35:48,710
awkward interactions right because and
you wouldn't want your

631
00:35:48,710 --> 00:35:52,180
good-natured help to be a considered
something

632
00:35:52,180 --> 00:35:56,089
that it's not a remember that

633
00:35:56,090 --> 00:36:00,580
you can always ask to speak to a lawyer
maybe they won't always say yes

634
00:36:00,580 --> 00:36:05,020
and and but you know if you're having an
interaction with the police that you're

635
00:36:05,020 --> 00:36:05,980
uncomfortable with

636
00:36:05,980 --> 00:36:09,410
I it's never a bad idea and

637
00:36:09,410 --> 00:36:13,310
as a general matter if they want
information from you and it is

638
00:36:13,310 --> 00:36:17,140
it is a good idea I think to speak to a
lawyer first because as we all know

639
00:36:17,140 --> 00:36:20,920
anything you say can be used against you
and

640
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:24,060
if you don't give them information then
they can't

641
00:36:24,060 --> 00:36:27,799
so maybe this is

642
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:30,830
I'm a little bit and I'm very big on
etiquette

643
00:36:30,830 --> 00:36:34,900
and and my mother was as well and so I
always feel a little bit silly when I

644
00:36:34,900 --> 00:36:39,010
when I talk about this because I'm just
kinda I have a thing about play nice but

645
00:36:39,010 --> 00:36:42,490
and really seriously in situations like
this

646
00:36:42,490 --> 00:36:45,570
I think it never is in it's never a bad
thing to be playing

647
00:36:45,570 --> 00:36:50,030
I think the situations can often had
become very awkward

648
00:36:50,030 --> 00:36:54,670
and you feel strange being uncooperative
because it feels confrontational unlike

649
00:36:54,670 --> 00:36:57,220
you only can escalate things and make
everything worse

650
00:36:57,220 --> 00:37:01,370
but remember it's it it's not in your
best interest to be helpful and it's not

651
00:37:01,370 --> 00:37:03,330
in your best interest of our information

652
00:37:03,330 --> 00:37:06,870
and I think that often police officers
can try to use

653
00:37:06,870 --> 00:37:10,799
use use that against you you know trade
and you make you feel like you're being

654
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:14,110
of you know rude and uncooperative so
that you feel like you need to change

655
00:37:14,110 --> 00:37:15,110
the way your acting

656
00:37:15,110 --> 00:37:19,260
so and I think that to help kinda keep
things

657
00:37:19,260 --> 00:37:22,870
you know kind of collin copacetic you
know just be polite

658
00:37:22,870 --> 00:37:26,299
any you know you're not gonna help on
but you don't have to be

659
00:37:26,300 --> 00:37:31,260
antagonistic you know there are some
things that are some very bad idea that

660
00:37:31,260 --> 00:37:31,880
he did on

661
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:35,600
and you know I'm not giving legal advice
here but I'm just saying

662
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:38,850
there are some things that are bad ideas
one is lying

663
00:37:38,850 --> 00:37:43,630
to the police it is a very bad idea to
lie that is a separate and a string and

664
00:37:43,630 --> 00:37:44,970
distinct crime

665
00:37:44,970 --> 00:37:49,960
and if you lie it make give them grounds
to pursue something against you that

666
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:51,010
they didn't have

667
00:37:51,010 --> 00:37:54,210
before and and so it

668
00:37:54,210 --> 00:37:58,040
never lie either affirmatively or by
omission

669
00:37:58,040 --> 00:38:01,420
I think that is important

670
00:38:01,420 --> 00:38:04,700
it's a bad idea to interfere with the
search

671
00:38:04,700 --> 00:38:08,010
if they come into your home and they are
searching your things

672
00:38:08,010 --> 00:38:11,410
if they're searching im if you look at
that warrant and it doesn't have

673
00:38:11,410 --> 00:38:12,259
computers

674
00:38:12,260 --> 00:38:15,420
in it and they're searching your
computer that taking your computer

675
00:38:15,420 --> 00:38:18,420
don't try to wrestle it away from them
or

676
00:38:18,420 --> 00:38:23,390
you know just let him do it and then
talk to your lawyer about it

677
00:38:23,390 --> 00:38:26,580
it is very important not to destroy

678
00:38:26,580 --> 00:38:30,620
delete or alter anything that might
frustrate an investigation and he gave a

679
00:38:30,620 --> 00:38:32,330
hold on this yesterday

680
00:38:32,330 --> 00:38:35,450
and he is and he's done a lot of
research on this and if you have

681
00:38:35,450 --> 00:38:38,830
questions about this he's a great person
to talk to you

682
00:38:38,830 --> 00:38:42,290
okay so compelled disclosure passwords

683
00:38:42,290 --> 00:38:45,870
encryption passphrase is and incorrect
information

684
00:38:45,870 --> 00:38:49,560
I'm actually getting a whole talk on
this an at Def Con

685
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:53,520
in a couple of weeks and so I'm not
going to get into it a a whole lot

686
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:58,700
but and I think that it is a it is a a
good thing to discuss

687
00:38:58,700 --> 00:39:02,120
so the fifth amendment gives you the
right to not

688
00:39:02,120 --> 00:39:06,660
incriminate yourself no person shall be
compelled in any criminal case

689
00:39:06,660 --> 00:39:12,580
to be a witness against himself and so
the privilege against self-incrimination

690
00:39:12,580 --> 00:39:16,330
at protect against government attempts
to you

691
00:39:16,330 --> 00:39:20,380
in force you to give testimonial
evidence that would tend to incriminate

692
00:39:20,380 --> 00:39:21,760
you

693
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:26,560
now I think its easy day to grasp the
concept of what is

694
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:29,660
compelled its when they force you its
Whitney

695
00:39:29,660 --> 00:39:33,960
its it's when you don't have a choice
right and if they walk into your house

696
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:38,210
and you know they're they're they wanna
like lot on your computer and saying oh

697
00:39:38,210 --> 00:39:39,190
hey would you can hear

698
00:39:39,190 --> 00:39:42,710
encryption passphrase is is that do you
have to give it to them

699
00:39:42,710 --> 00:39:47,150
who think you have to give it time
actually

700
00:39:47,150 --> 00:39:50,190
and the only time you can be forced

701
00:39:50,190 --> 00:39:53,460
to give information in a situation like
this is by a judge

702
00:39:53,460 --> 00:39:58,350
okay and only if you don't have a valid
privilege against self-incrimination

703
00:39:58,350 --> 00:40:04,440
cell keep that in mind we talk about
compulsion

704
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:07,810
excuse me

705
00:40:07,810 --> 00:40:13,529
I'm getting on and getting to that okay
so the next part is testimonial evidence

706
00:40:13,530 --> 00:40:17,710
what is testimonial verses non
testimonial okay testimonial evidence is

707
00:40:17,710 --> 00:40:18,640
when you reveal

708
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:23,290
the contents of your mind okay as
opposed to like some physical tangible

709
00:40:23,290 --> 00:40:26,330
thing so a good way to think about this

710
00:40:26,330 --> 00:40:30,770
is a combination lock verse is a key

711
00:40:30,770 --> 00:40:34,180
and this is actually comparison that the
and

712
00:40:34,180 --> 00:40:37,529
that's that the Supreme Court has put
out there

713
00:40:37,530 --> 00:40:40,980
so if the police wanted to unlock

714
00:40:40,980 --> 00:40:44,920
a safe and the safe at a combination
lock

715
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:49,110
and the only way they can get the
combination is by making you say it

716
00:40:49,110 --> 00:40:52,960
then that implicates the privilege
against self-incrimination

717
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:55,210
because you would have to be telling
them something that revealed the

718
00:40:55,210 --> 00:40:56,670
contents of your mind

719
00:40:56,670 --> 00:40:59,950
alright now if there is a key to that
safe

720
00:40:59,950 --> 00:41:03,690
and they say give us the key to that
safe if you have the key

721
00:41:03,690 --> 00:41:06,780
that the fifth amendment doesn't protect
you from having to turn it over because

722
00:41:06,780 --> 00:41:08,240
it is a physical thing

723
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:11,550
it doesn't reveal anything about your
mind that would

724
00:41:11,550 --> 00:41:15,130
give them and evidence against you

725
00:41:15,130 --> 00:41:18,620
okay does that make sense

726
00:41:18,620 --> 00:41:24,029
yeah well and and were we're gonna talk
a little bit about that too

727
00:41:24,030 --> 00:41:28,140
okay one thing that's important to
realize and and this is something that

728
00:41:28,140 --> 00:41:29,210
gets a little bit

729
00:41:29,210 --> 00:41:34,180
difficult to figure out and the
privilege of self-incrimination

730
00:41:34,180 --> 00:41:38,399
can apply to an act up production

731
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:41,640
giving something over if it has
testimonial

732
00:41:41,640 --> 00:41:45,230
aspects meaning if you give it to them

733
00:41:45,230 --> 00:41:48,480
it would tend to confirm the existence a

734
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:52,330
something or that you possess it or that
you control it

735
00:41:52,330 --> 00:41:55,680
or that it's authentic alright and

736
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:58,839
I think that's where this becomes
important when we talk about

737
00:41:58,840 --> 00:42:01,850
a attempts to 42 turnover passwords and

738
00:42:01,850 --> 00:42:05,069
encrypt the data because if you are
first if you you know the this a step

739
00:42:05,070 --> 00:42:08,580
that already exists right but if you are
forced to turn over

740
00:42:08,580 --> 00:42:13,090
and and a password or passphrase or
you're forced to cryptid

741
00:42:13,090 --> 00:42:16,910
what you're basically showing is that
you

742
00:42:16,910 --> 00:42:20,170
have control over it right and that can
be very important

743
00:42:20,170 --> 00:42:23,800
an incriminating any case

744
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:26,850
and something that

745
00:42:26,850 --> 00:42:30,750
I think a lot of people and

746
00:42:30,750 --> 00:42:34,560
don't know but it's important to realize
is that

747
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:36,830
the fifth minute right against
self-incrimination is something that's

748
00:42:36,830 --> 00:42:38,360
very personal to you

749
00:42:38,360 --> 00:42:41,850
and your situation and

750
00:42:41,850 --> 00:42:45,529
it can only be invoked a by

751
00:42:45,530 --> 00:42:49,030
that the person who actually has the has
the right

752
00:42:49,030 --> 00:42:52,950
so if you know something about a friend
that might be incriminating

753
00:42:52,950 --> 00:42:56,600
and you can invoke the Fifth Amendment
right against self-incrimination to

754
00:42:56,600 --> 00:42:57,660
protect your friend

755
00:42:57,660 --> 00:43:01,370
okay it's only and only lies with you

756
00:43:01,370 --> 00:43:04,710
now I realize I actually made a mistake

757
00:43:04,710 --> 00:43:08,230
and in the next flight I believe oh no I
didn't

758
00:43:08,230 --> 00:43:13,350
okay one thing that and I I did not put
on my side but is important also is

759
00:43:13,350 --> 00:43:19,850
that with the concept of incrimination
is now

760
00:43:19,850 --> 00:43:22,970
now if you are something incriminating

761
00:43:22,970 --> 00:43:27,170
what that means is that and it might
give the government

762
00:43:27,170 --> 00:43:31,530
the information that it would need to
try to prosecute you for something it

763
00:43:31,530 --> 00:43:32,640
doesn't mean that you're actually

764
00:43:32,640 --> 00:43:35,740
guilty okay and the fifth amendment

765
00:43:35,740 --> 00:43:37,620
is something the serbs the Fifth
Amendment privilege against

766
00:43:37,620 --> 00:43:40,120
self-incrimination something to protect
the innocent

767
00:43:40,120 --> 00:43:43,440
as well as the guilty and that's
something the Supreme Court has said

768
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:47,010
what the fifth amendment protects is and

769
00:43:47,010 --> 00:43:50,490
it protects you against a diverse police
action

770
00:43:50,490 --> 00:43:55,660
based on being ensnared in ambiguous
circumstances

771
00:43:55,660 --> 00:43:58,529
that is actually the Supreme Court's
raise in sneered an ambiguous

772
00:43:58,530 --> 00:43:59,820
circumstances so

773
00:43:59,820 --> 00:44:03,540
you might be a totally innocent person
in a situation that looks bad

774
00:44:03,540 --> 00:44:07,290
and you haven't had them in a radiant
self incrimination and

775
00:44:07,290 --> 00:44:10,330
and you know that the the privileges
basically intended to protect you from

776
00:44:10,330 --> 00:44:11,290
being in this

777
00:44:11,290 --> 00:44:14,650
odd awkward position where you know your

778
00:44:14,650 --> 00:44:18,790
your only options are are basically two
you know give up information that might

779
00:44:18,790 --> 00:44:20,300
be against your interest

780
00:44:20,300 --> 00:44:22,900
that might be used to bring charges
against you either rightfully or

781
00:44:22,900 --> 00:44:24,120
wrongfully

782
00:44:24,120 --> 00:44:27,819
a or lie to the police or say it you
know

783
00:44:27,820 --> 00:44:30,820
I I can give you that information being
thrown in jail that's why we have the

784
00:44:30,820 --> 00:44:32,510
privilege against self-incrimination

785
00:44:32,510 --> 00:44:37,790
is because we don't want people to be in
that situation we think it's unfair

786
00:44:37,790 --> 00:44:41,170
there are a couple other important
exceptions a the first is

787
00:44:41,170 --> 00:44:44,890
foregone conclusion if the if the cuts
are you have a pretty good idea

788
00:44:44,890 --> 00:44:48,089
that there is evidence in your
possession and what it is and where

789
00:44:48,090 --> 00:44:49,400
they're gonna find it

790
00:44:49,400 --> 00:44:53,460
but the privilege might not apply
because the important factor is the

791
00:44:53,460 --> 00:44:55,140
difference between what you know

792
00:44:55,140 --> 00:44:58,830
and what they know and it basically you
wouldn't be telling them anything they

793
00:44:58,830 --> 00:45:00,120
don't already know

794
00:45:00,120 --> 00:45:03,440
then there's no privilege to protect
basically and you may still have to turn

795
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:05,270
stuff over

796
00:45:05,270 --> 00:45:08,540
the other thing is immunity the
government can overcome

797
00:45:08,540 --> 00:45:11,950
a privilege that you have by giving you
community

798
00:45:11,950 --> 00:45:15,150
a from prosecution based on

799
00:45:15,150 --> 00:45:19,110
that that production information or
anything they would learn

800
00:45:19,110 --> 00:45:23,320
as a result a having that information or
anything they would discover

801
00:45:23,320 --> 00:45:26,880
as a result having that information and
the reason why that is because

802
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:29,680
if there's no longer a possibility that
you could incriminate yourself because

803
00:45:29,680 --> 00:45:31,560
they're not gonna bring charges against
you

804
00:45:31,560 --> 00:45:35,430
then the privilege doesn't apply okay
but the important thing is that

805
00:45:35,430 --> 00:45:39,149
whatever immunity they offer has to be
just as broad as the privilege

806
00:45:39,150 --> 00:45:42,820
or else it's just not good enough you
still have a privilege

807
00:45:42,820 --> 00:45:46,450
there've been a some important cases
along these lines and it really just

808
00:45:46,450 --> 00:45:48,320
come up in the past few years

809
00:45:48,320 --> 00:45:52,040
I'm not gonna talk about them in detail
and I'm going to go through them in

810
00:45:52,040 --> 00:45:54,520
excruciating detail at Def Con

811
00:45:54,520 --> 00:45:59,340
if you wanna come to that and talk and
but basically that the rule that kinda

812
00:45:59,340 --> 00:46:03,850
and emerges a from these cases I would
say is that

813
00:46:03,850 --> 00:46:06,880
the courts seem to believe that you have
the knowledge that the name a privilege

814
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:08,800
against self-incrimination

815
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:13,260
that you know protect you against having
to disclose your password

816
00:46:13,260 --> 00:46:16,460
and if it would tend to incriminate you
and

817
00:46:16,460 --> 00:46:21,300
it can be a tougher call a if it is a
situation where they just want you to

818
00:46:21,300 --> 00:46:21,890
you

819
00:46:21,890 --> 00:46:25,529
produce a decree did version have been
corrupted data

820
00:46:25,530 --> 00:46:29,370
and but you know basically if they are
ready

821
00:46:29,370 --> 00:46:33,109
have a good sense that there's something
incriminating on your computer and

822
00:46:33,110 --> 00:46:36,220
turning it over wouldn't tell them
anything they don't already know

823
00:46:36,220 --> 00:46:39,450
then foregone conclusion in the
privilege doesn't apply

824
00:46:39,450 --> 00:46:43,300
but if they're trying to force you to
decrypt data and it would tell them

825
00:46:43,300 --> 00:46:46,430
something they don't already know it
would reveal the existence of

826
00:46:46,430 --> 00:46:50,220
love evidence that they don't know about
it would reveal that you have a certain

827
00:46:50,220 --> 00:46:51,910
our control over something

828
00:46:51,910 --> 00:46:55,450
that they didn't know you had control
over then you may very well have

829
00:46:55,450 --> 00:46:58,550
it has been a privilege against
self-incrimination alright

830
00:46:58,550 --> 00:47:01,800
so okay what can you do choose

831
00:47:01,800 --> 00:47:04,990
strong passphrase is that you can
remember

832
00:47:04,990 --> 00:47:09,700
so there in your brain and I use a
password manager

833
00:47:09,700 --> 00:47:15,660
and how many people here use password
managers okay

834
00:47:15,660 --> 00:47:19,560
I think that this is a good option
because you can have strong passwords

835
00:47:19,560 --> 00:47:22,810
and while it is true they are reported
you have to have the password to access

836
00:47:22,810 --> 00:47:23,820
them

837
00:47:23,820 --> 00:47:27,580
and if you remember that password a I
think that that is

838
00:47:27,580 --> 00:47:32,520
a good situation if you are asked to
turn over a password consider exercising

839
00:47:32,520 --> 00:47:33,920
your right to remain silent

840
00:47:33,920 --> 00:47:37,980
consult a lawyer about that and and you
remember only a judge can foresee to

841
00:47:37,980 --> 00:47:41,410
turn it over so it might be best to err
on the side of refusing to disclose

842
00:47:41,410 --> 00:47:44,319
information let your lawyer deal with it

843
00:47:44,320 --> 00:47:47,930
choosing a strong passphrase a I don't
know you can see this

844
00:47:47,930 --> 00:47:51,660
xkcd a good advice on choosing a strong
password

845
00:47:51,660 --> 00:47:54,759
few if you want to come back and look at
this you wanna password with

846
00:47:54,760 --> 00:47:58,540
and high entropy but something that easy
for you to remember and difficult for

847
00:47:58,540 --> 00:47:59,830
other people to guess

848
00:47:59,830 --> 00:48:03,520
and you know he basically suggest
choosing for

849
00:48:03,520 --> 00:48:07,070
random common words and having an
demonic device so that it means

850
00:48:07,070 --> 00:48:09,120
something to you but it doesn't mean

851
00:48:09,120 --> 00:48:12,680
anything to anybody else but it further
reading we have a

852
00:48:12,680 --> 00:48:17,129
white paper know your rights and we have
tips for talking to the police which you

853
00:48:17,130 --> 00:48:18,040
can get at the eff that

854
00:48:18,040 --> 00:48:21,690
at the effect on your booth and that's
it

855
00:48:21,690 --> 00:48:28,690
and I got questions done

856
00:48:31,110 --> 00:48:35,230
and one thing before we start and
remember if you have a personal

857
00:48:35,230 --> 00:48:38,000
situation you'd like to talk about don't
bring it up here come talk to us

858
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:38,780
privately

859
00:48:38,780 --> 00:48:41,930
and I know that probably and we're not
gonna have time to make everybody's

860
00:48:41,930 --> 00:48:44,100
questions so come talk to me and or
Henny

861
00:48:44,100 --> 00:48:47,420
later okay hello thank you and we'll
talk

862
00:48:47,420 --> 00:48:52,660
I was warning about these little USB
drives and some hypothetical situations

863
00:48:52,660 --> 00:48:56,980
a what's a better position to be in the
USB drivers new computer desk

864
00:48:56,980 --> 00:49:01,320
and your house gets searched you have it
on your person you get searched

865
00:49:01,320 --> 00:49:04,970
for your running away from cops then it
gets lost in the woods

866
00:49:04,970 --> 00:49:11,970
oh my gosh

867
00:49:13,840 --> 00:49:15,000
I guess and way

868
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:18,760
if the question is what puts you in the
best position legally

869
00:49:18,760 --> 00:49:23,080
yes I would say that if you have it in
your desk drawer

870
00:49:23,080 --> 00:49:27,460
they're probably going to need a warrant
to get it if you have it on your person

871
00:49:27,460 --> 00:49:31,000
and you're in a situation where you get
arrested or something I think

872
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:35,380
it it depends on jurisdiction you know
they may say well we seized incident to

873
00:49:35,380 --> 00:49:38,160
arrest we don't need or in some other
court might say that the

874
00:49:38,160 --> 00:49:42,819
do you want if you throw it away a my
concern is that if they find it

875
00:49:42,820 --> 00:49:46,220
it looks like maybe you try to get rid
of the evidence and that probably isn't

876
00:49:46,220 --> 00:49:47,110
very good for you

877
00:49:47,110 --> 00:49:51,540
that's my take on it and I was warming
up about third-party

878
00:49:51,540 --> 00:49:55,000
I information disclosures has been any
case law about

879
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:59,010
EPS provides because they're like
virtual imaginary computer systems

880
00:49:59,010 --> 00:50:03,720
but you're in complete control although
the hardware belongs to someone else

881
00:50:03,720 --> 00:50:06,950
I'm not aware of any cases on that yet
all right thank you

882
00:50:06,950 --> 00:50:13,130
the law is slow like I said before it
takes a long time to catch up okay

883
00:50:13,130 --> 00:50:16,610
on I've been asked to remind you that we
have a table downstairs and you can

884
00:50:16,610 --> 00:50:20,080
you know me with us down there happy to
talk with you and you have time for a

885
00:50:20,080 --> 00:50:20,910
couple more questions

886
00:50:20,910 --> 00:50:23,940
okay people yea man you mentioned

887
00:50:23,940 --> 00:50:27,600
musicals suspicion at airports for the
next the searcher

888
00:50:27,600 --> 00:50:32,420
body so I so it's not like he outside of
your personally think that

889
00:50:32,420 --> 00:50:36,620
yeah so how do the full scan full body
scanners

890
00:50:36,620 --> 00:50:39,940
play into that at all if they do yet
that is

891
00:50:39,940 --> 00:50:43,200
that is kinda a difficult question you
know I think then

892
00:50:43,200 --> 00:50:47,120
the reason that the courts have said and
spring court

893
00:50:47,120 --> 00:50:50,339
has said that you know if they suspect
you're smuggling drugs or something

894
00:50:50,340 --> 00:50:53,730
any reasonable suspicion to you know
search the interior of your body

895
00:50:53,730 --> 00:50:56,830
is because that is such an invasive
thing RA

896
00:50:56,830 --> 00:51:00,779
like physically invasive and I don't
think anybody disputes that you have a

897
00:51:00,780 --> 00:51:02,750
reasonable expectation of privacy

898
00:51:02,750 --> 00:51:05,850
in you know your alimentary canal

899
00:51:05,850 --> 00:51:10,720
alright and I think that the idea is
that and you know the full body scanners

900
00:51:10,720 --> 00:51:14,270
don't involve any physical intrusion and
i'm aware.

901
00:51:14,270 --> 00:51:17,920
one horton hears you consider the fourth
and indications are that under the

902
00:51:17,920 --> 00:51:18,570
fourth minute

903
00:51:18,570 --> 00:51:22,390
kosher and I I suspect that

904
00:51:22,390 --> 00:51:25,850
it was a more physically invasive
procedure

905
00:51:25,850 --> 00:51:28,970
that case may not have gone that way
that's my take on that

906
00:51:28,970 --> 00:51:32,130
hi

907
00:51:32,130 --> 00:51:36,220
wanna go back to %uh surgeons injured
incident to arrest him

908
00:51:36,220 --> 00:51:39,950
amo will read on the issue but I know
that I am I read the 7th Circuit opinion

909
00:51:39,950 --> 00:51:43,980
risley judge poser upheld the search my
cell phone near

910
00:51:43,980 --> 00:51:48,000
it's interesting and his rationales were
not convincing to me at all

911
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:52,110
little biased but I'm curious arm play
devil's advocate

912
00:51:52,110 --> 00:51:56,100
what are the best arguments you heard
and support that search because

913
00:51:56,100 --> 00:51:59,720
the earlier %uh they there was the base
officers save them for the preservation

914
00:51:59,720 --> 00:52:00,400
of evidence

915
00:52:00,400 --> 00:52:04,380
the best the best arguments in favor of
the idea that the police

916
00:52:04,380 --> 00:52:08,030
ought to be able to search incident to
correct your I think the best arguments

917
00:52:08,030 --> 00:52:08,510
that I've

918
00:52:08,510 --> 00:52:12,020
I've heard the government offer up is
the idea that you might remotely wipe

919
00:52:12,020 --> 00:52:12,610
your phone

920
00:52:12,610 --> 00:52:16,380
and it may take the time to get a
warrant the evidence might disappear

921
00:52:16,380 --> 00:52:19,840
and and you know our response to that
has been that

922
00:52:19,840 --> 00:52:23,630
you know a sound forensic practice would
be too

923
00:52:23,630 --> 00:52:27,100
you know put that only end up here in a
bag

924
00:52:27,100 --> 00:52:31,050
have some sort and you know basically
get a warrant and then search it

925
00:52:31,050 --> 00:52:34,390
and because if you don't do that I mean
you may end up teaching your evidence

926
00:52:34,390 --> 00:52:35,420
anyway so

927
00:52:35,420 --> 00:52:38,900
anything if you have a situation where
policeman's rifling through phone

928
00:52:38,900 --> 00:52:43,230
that's probably not a good at situation
from the forensics perspective

929
00:52:43,230 --> 00:52:47,500
so and yeah I would say that's probably
the best argument

930
00:52:47,500 --> 00:52:53,870
okay thank you could you go over a few
the main differences between

931
00:52:53,870 --> 00:52:58,490
a criminal %uh investigation boers like
the civil lawsuit like discovery

932
00:52:58,490 --> 00:53:01,700
a law that would discovery delic so

933
00:53:01,700 --> 00:53:05,270
me is that when you know their search
your house right when you're in

934
00:53:05,270 --> 00:53:06,590
discovery process and

935
00:53:06,590 --> 00:53:10,190
your you're being asked questions and
and you know

936
00:53:10,190 --> 00:53:14,790
you having to give up information
voluntarily and I'm

937
00:53:14,790 --> 00:53:18,130
I think that that could be a very long
and involved answer when we talk about

938
00:53:18,130 --> 00:53:19,100
that a little later

939
00:53:19,100 --> 00:53:22,780
that's okay on great saw thinking along
the seine

940
00:53:22,780 --> 00:53:28,050
financial info is always privilege soul
if I upload a copy of my QuickBooks to

941
00:53:28,050 --> 00:53:28,550
my job

942
00:53:28,550 --> 00:53:31,760
ons will not prevent them from living in
the mountains so

943
00:53:31,760 --> 00:53:35,580
I'm sorry I I did not mean to suggest
suggest the financial aid is all

944
00:53:35,580 --> 00:53:39,110
is always privileged and what I meant to
say it anyone

945
00:53:39,110 --> 00:53:43,300
my point was that there are different
laws that protect privacy a financial

946
00:53:43,300 --> 00:53:45,780
data in certain circumstances like when
it's held by

947
00:53:45,780 --> 00:53:50,110
financial institutions and I wasn't sure
how those laws

948
00:53:50,110 --> 00:53:53,330
interact with act but with the
communications privacy laws

949
00:53:53,330 --> 00:53:57,870
and I i don't think it is sir
universally true that financial data

950
00:53:57,870 --> 00:53:58,460
gets

951
00:53:58,460 --> 00:54:01,960
you know like a special like financial
privilege or something like that

952
00:54:01,960 --> 00:54:05,760
and but when I would say is that

953
00:54:05,760 --> 00:54:09,210
and you know if you have data

954
00:54:09,210 --> 00:54:13,110
that you encrypt that is uploaded to a
service like

955
00:54:13,110 --> 00:54:17,320
well to a to a third party Store service
and you are the only one who's in a

956
00:54:17,320 --> 00:54:18,370
position to

957
00:54:18,370 --> 00:54:23,009
decrypts that information I think that
you're in a pretty good position legally

958
00:54:23,010 --> 00:54:26,350
and because you know they're going to
have a hard time getting

959
00:54:26,350 --> 00:54:30,319
access to that data with a like
low-level process

960
00:54:30,320 --> 00:54:33,650
because you know you would have to been
a bust in a position to have to correct

961
00:54:33,650 --> 00:54:33,930
it

962
00:54:33,930 --> 00:54:37,460
right so we'll be talking up with an
answer to that point

963
00:54:37,460 --> 00:54:39,290
at that okay sorry I'm done thank you
guys
