00:00:01,470 --> 00:00:08,470
you

2
00:00:18,700 --> 00:00:20,330
home

3
00:00:20,330 --> 00:00:22,960
you get the

4
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:26,119
suit new good intervals within

5
00:00:26,119 --> 00:00:31,009
in was involved

6
00:00:31,010 --> 00:00:32,800
it down

7
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:39,800
we members

8
00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:59,590
yuan dream

9
00:01:06,490 --> 00:01:13,490
on

10
00:01:54,700 --> 00:02:01,700
news

11
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:10,318
him

12
00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:17,319
there's years

13
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:27,080
new

14
00:02:36,070 --> 00:02:40,180
at work a thing of I

15
00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:43,150
not good

16
00:02:43,150 --> 00:02:43,819
sometime

17
00:02:43,819 --> 00:02:50,819
him

18
00:02:52,450 --> 00:02:56,299
they are my life and this is my friend
Press the gun

19
00:02:56,299 --> 00:02:59,890
alright mom so on

20
00:02:59,890 --> 00:03:04,700
the aristocrats I came up with the name
in this presentation cuz it's like a a

21
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:08,670
it's like a joke an anti joke that
median selling each other

22
00:03:08,670 --> 00:03:12,329
and my friend Chris discover these
vulnerabilities in a

23
00:03:12,329 --> 00:03:15,670
like in a doc says cable modem slash
router

24
00:03:15,670 --> 00:03:19,120
and he thinks he knows just lazy
engineering

25
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:22,310
I think were being trolled by the
hackers who when

26
00:03:22,310 --> 00:03:25,329
the a worst possible security n just so

27
00:03:25,329 --> 00:03:29,950
this moment could happen where somebody
would come talk about our

28
00:03:29,950 --> 00:03:34,110
alright so um on

29
00:03:34,110 --> 00:03:38,480
that the cable companies the carriers
they don't have a sense of humor

30
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:45,020
so I try this tab now been doing here
that you will not have %um from them

31
00:03:45,020 --> 00:03:49,390
and then don't fuck with them please we
own our own gear

32
00:03:49,390 --> 00:03:54,010
yes alright so this the box we're
talking about today

33
00:03:54,010 --> 00:03:58,630
I am and this is the box Chris moved to
Brooklyn and got this

34
00:03:58,630 --> 00:04:02,030
with his cable service a yep alright so
it

35
00:04:02,030 --> 00:04:05,300
is a cable modem like you expect but
it's also a wireless router like you

36
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:06,040
dare

37
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:09,200
normally see from alexis boxer Netgear
box

38
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:12,290
and it's just sell the next box that's
running the

39
00:04:12,290 --> 00:04:17,120
2.6 current select early said

40
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:20,140
kinda all started when I moved to
Brooklyn on

41
00:04:20,140 --> 00:04:23,539
I got my internet hooked up in I got
this

42
00:04:23,540 --> 00:04:29,230
China device in I am they left me a
little note saying here's your

43
00:04:29,230 --> 00:04:32,960
WPA key in who's really long really
knowing

44
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:36,020
I just want to change the password to
something easy like my dog's name

45
00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:40,090
I turns out there was a

46
00:04:40,090 --> 00:04:44,610
really so simple a configured out there
was a manual that came with the device

47
00:04:44,610 --> 00:04:49,410
so homage sat there and stared at it for
a long time

48
00:04:49,410 --> 00:04:56,410
was really mad by the way can you guys
see the WPA key

49
00:04:56,630 --> 00:05:02,770
they're like anything sketchy about that
I'm thank you

50
00:05:02,770 --> 00:05:06,580
yeah that's the monomer

51
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:09,580
on it and that should

52
00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:14,180
triggers them now we did not and

53
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:17,280
session vaguely triggers some memories

54
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:20,370
hood it's it's never happened before

55
00:05:20,370 --> 00:05:25,660
ever doesn't

56
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:28,770
dinner then on

57
00:05:28,770 --> 00:05:32,539
yet so the last six digits

58
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:36,460
you know you to deliberate force that
right but book

59
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:40,190
Mike what's the deal with the number 12
that

60
00:05:40,190 --> 00:05:45,140
a its in the SSID internet password so
must be significant

61
00:05:45,140 --> 00:05:52,140
it could be naked arrest

62
00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:58,220
the ok

63
00:05:58,220 --> 00:06:03,570
okay so on the other thing about this is
beyond where you can see

64
00:06:03,570 --> 00:06:07,320
from your living room there's lotsa
services that have gone and

65
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:12,260
on gathered SSID eased and BSS ID's the
mac Address is

66
00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:15,880
Google Yahoo go for one knows all about
this

67
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:20,350
then there's another one like all that
has and you can search for this

68
00:06:20,350 --> 00:06:24,820
for this particular device and find
bottom hands if you wanna start your

69
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:26,340
were driving a particularly

70
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:29,440
fruitful place the internet will tell
you how to

71
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:32,450
I was way too lazy to or drive

72
00:06:32,450 --> 00:06:37,110
did but thirty-third we're going to
think you'll find is that

73
00:06:37,110 --> 00:06:40,660
on did allow a similar %uh societies

74
00:06:40,660 --> 00:06:43,880
beef you to search for the manufactures

75
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:47,230
a.m. units

76
00:06:47,230 --> 00:06:50,450
it's not necessarily same ol number but
you start seeing the same pattern

77
00:06:50,450 --> 00:06:53,719
out and that's a good point risk is
there's a

78
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:56,800
a number here they're very similar to
the the box we're talking about today

79
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,320
that we haven't looked at

80
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:02,120
because we done on them bet you one
wanted these you should take a look

81
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:06,320
so that was the DD nine fifty in the WTM
in the TG

82
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:12,480
862 here said yet so we have a really
tiny hacking at every turn

83
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:17,250
that's right better way yes over my fix
it so

84
00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:21,810
how do you think we should fix is like
where you guys think we should do you to

85
00:07:21,810 --> 00:07:22,490
wear

86
00:07:22,490 --> 00:07:27,500
might generate a PS ke at PSK that can
be printed on a sticker and that their

87
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:31,200
the router from the firmware can
generate on B-two

88
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:34,720
so from information it has so

89
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:38,530
like the mac address is e my kids are
the venture beakers you know there's the

90
00:07:38,530 --> 00:07:42,670
24 bits there man factor ID and 24
minutes they should be

91
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:45,900
more less needy advice but bike they're
not

92
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:50,390
bill with ran the numbers are going to
be sequential numbers and likely be fine

93
00:07:50,390 --> 00:07:51,180
wanna

94
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:55,770
your house in Goa few a few thousand

95
00:07:55,770 --> 00:07:59,200
numbers each direction you're going to
find your neighbors have similar mac

96
00:07:59,200 --> 00:07:59,890
Address is

97
00:07:59,890 --> 00:08:04,940
says they may have any ideas on their
where you into you

98
00:08:04,940 --> 00:08:08,390
if you you need to print PSK than
stickers and you also need a

99
00:08:08,390 --> 00:08:15,390
the router to be doubt been generated
PSK that matches their

100
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:28,720
just Hashim no way

101
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:33,789
hacer answer you end up with the same
group force possibility that he just

102
00:08:33,789 --> 00:08:34,400
acid

103
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:38,098
bed yeah I'm not a good idea Zen bed w

104
00:08:38,099 --> 00:08:42,919
the WPS pin is another idea WPS itself
has been broken but there's that

105
00:08:42,919 --> 00:08:46,529
aided in numbers seven which share Spurs
meanie

106
00:08:46,529 --> 00:08:49,610
there may be others are the men should
be you can tap into you

107
00:08:49,610 --> 00:08:53,020
to the ROM making a.m.

108
00:08:53,020 --> 00:09:00,010
if we had prizes user when

109
00:09:00,010 --> 00:09:05,439
so meanwhile and son stop staring so I I
called up my provider

110
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:09,660
and I said hey i really wanna get the
passer in so I can log in to this thing

111
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:15,360
and change money WPA password because I
i'm happy with the on

112
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:19,300
so they typically don't allow customers
do that a

113
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:23,600
unless the customer is under attack
could get an A

114
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:28,010
on so I guess what if I want to change
it

115
00:09:28,010 --> 00:09:31,939
a.m. every now and then for security
reasons so

116
00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:36,540
unfortunate we'll provide access to the
router okay fine so goes on and on

117
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:39,740
on ask more questions

118
00:09:39,740 --> 00:09:42,750
and then she came down to it we can
purchase your own router

119
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:47,170
and watches but this rather in bridge
mode in new computers behind it them

120
00:09:47,170 --> 00:09:54,170
aka I think I might be that soon
actually so how do we log in

121
00:09:56,230 --> 00:09:59,370
to this shiny new router which

122
00:09:59,370 --> 00:10:03,070
has a nice web interface but we know the
password to

123
00:10:03,070 --> 00:10:08,670
look googling discovered that mothers
guy out there and South American who

124
00:10:08,670 --> 00:10:13,020
had a a different mile from the same a
factor in he found out that there's like

125
00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:14,800
this thing called the password to the
day

126
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:19,760
it's really community if your technician
so I was like okay there's no way that

127
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:21,670
works for mind what turns out it does

128
00:10:21,670 --> 00:10:26,969
and that's been out there since August
29th 2010

129
00:10:26,970 --> 00:10:30,510
so I'm work back ban a different model

130
00:10:30,510 --> 00:10:34,050
to differ miles works in our model on

131
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:40,290
hoping to work for many other miles so
when

132
00:10:40,290 --> 00:10:43,860
1password the rolling maul you know the
day you know the algorithm

133
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:47,300
you know the password today already on

134
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:51,880
you could probably start thinking about
some attacks at this point on

135
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:55,060
but we wanted to just confirm this with
our model so

136
00:10:55,060 --> 00:10:58,520
aside from the couple ones that that we
purchased them

137
00:10:58,520 --> 00:11:01,709
we want to just go out there and ask
some people and turns out that other

138
00:11:01,709 --> 00:11:03,050
folks that have a small

139
00:11:03,050 --> 00:11:06,050
were able to get in with that password
the day

140
00:11:06,050 --> 00:11:09,860
that's great and i could change mine

141
00:11:09,860 --> 00:11:14,560
WPA key so

142
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:18,100
big glass a min you know attacks

143
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:21,480
I could blow dryer and New York City in

144
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:25,579
find these models and log into the
router and reconfigure min

145
00:11:25,579 --> 00:11:30,100
on the world that's really annoying on

146
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:34,520
we could possibly do some quick jacking
across a request for a reason

147
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:38,140
decent spear fishing or something like
that we really need to know more about

148
00:11:38,140 --> 00:11:39,360
the device before

149
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:42,490
before we do any that on

150
00:11:42,490 --> 00:11:46,900
so let's actually log in

151
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:53,900
because we sell logged in at this point

152
00:11:54,019 --> 00:11:57,980
the top left is the login page on

153
00:11:57,980 --> 00:12:01,290
liquid be resource home

154
00:12:01,290 --> 00:12:07,430
by writers the JavaScript turns out
better

155
00:12:07,430 --> 00:12:10,550
you know it does

156
00:12:10,550 --> 00:12:14,680
kinda post some authentication
credentials to the wise to the ways does

157
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:15,440
respond

158
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:18,480
but then the JavaScript make sure that
it's actually a valid

159
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:21,690
ok and it turns out that

160
00:12:21,690 --> 00:12:25,850
if you actually remove everything else
on

161
00:12:25,850 --> 00:12:31,560
out in the cookie that is being sent and
just put valid Eagles Jim

162
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:38,560
you can login ok see on your password
access

163
00:12:39,690 --> 00:12:43,259
web interface just that cookie on

164
00:12:43,259 --> 00:12:47,620
says the measure interface doesn't
require password

165
00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:51,040
how was it handling configuration
changes on a bus

166
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:58,040
I but I now okay so this point we log
into the box

167
00:12:59,029 --> 00:13:02,420
and where you seen

168
00:13:02,420 --> 00:13:06,970
like intercepting party like Berber that
and we're looking at lapd we make

169
00:13:06,970 --> 00:13:09,860
configuration changes and we see these
calls to

170
00:13:09,860 --> 00:13:13,930
as in peace at and S&P get functions and
JavaScript

171
00:13:13,930 --> 00:13:19,630
on size and be as a service is commonly
deployed to manage network

172
00:13:19,630 --> 00:13:24,699
here and this tells us some more about
how the year

173
00:13:24,699 --> 00:13:28,509
essentially they have sort of like a a

174
00:13:28,509 --> 00:13:31,689
ACP de Santi SNMP

175
00:13:31,689 --> 00:13:36,139
proxy running through the web interface
so an

176
00:13:36,139 --> 00:13:39,170
you we see these examples here there

177
00:13:39,170 --> 00:13:42,480
S&P said S&P get the walk

178
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:46,259
which is S&P walk and which just steps
through

179
00:13:46,259 --> 00:13:49,500
sequentially to a once again next

180
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:53,120
statements and and we haven't done any
hacking it because we're just looking at

181
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:53,899
.javascript

182
00:13:53,899 --> 00:13:57,410
yes on

183
00:13:57,410 --> 00:14:02,170
so there's enterprise enterprise
identify RFO rarest

184
00:14:02,170 --> 00:14:05,930
we take a look at that and if you Jess

185
00:14:05,930 --> 00:14:09,800
is really hard to read but essentially
it says the IP address the router

186
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:13,480
slash walk question mark Boyd and and

187
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:17,540
that enterprise IT ended essentially
just dumps all configure a router

188
00:14:17,540 --> 00:14:19,319
including the passwords

189
00:14:19,319 --> 00:14:23,490
which are admin password in technician
technician in my case

190
00:14:23,490 --> 00:14:26,760
his his password on your device for a
slightly different but they can still be

191
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:27,430
grabbed

192
00:14:27,430 --> 00:14:31,000
through this call without any other
occasions 0

193
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:34,430
that whole thing we had about bypassing
authentication you may need that you

194
00:14:34,430 --> 00:14:35,290
just need to

195
00:14:35,290 --> 00:14:38,420
open a web browser and navigate this URL
you get

196
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:41,860
yes setting a cookie is way too high
tech yeah

197
00:14:41,860 --> 00:14:45,420
hope

198
00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:49,470
okay so what you can do through this
SNMP

199
00:14:49,470 --> 00:14:53,399
interface some examples are you can get
the admin password in case

200
00:14:53,399 --> 00:14:56,899
them you wanted to see it you can reboot
the router which would be great for

201
00:14:56,899 --> 00:14:57,620
trolling

202
00:14:57,620 --> 00:15:02,529
you can disable the firewall and you can
change their DNS servers

203
00:15:02,529 --> 00:15:09,240
or you can change their pastor and all
these again

204
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:13,930
don't require any other occasional 19
the curtain seeking really

205
00:15:13,930 --> 00:15:19,529
pick any allied Ian change it so it's
kinda the worst case scenario here

206
00:15:19,529 --> 00:15:22,970
let's say it will expose on the web or

207
00:15:22,970 --> 00:15:26,250
but saying that its them

208
00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:30,470
possible like

209
00:15:30,470 --> 00:15:35,470
assuming that it was exposed on the

210
00:15:35,470 --> 00:15:39,899
lamp or on you could have courses
broadcast

211
00:15:39,899 --> 00:15:44,329
some unease get requests all over the
web in start aggregating devices

212
00:15:44,329 --> 00:15:49,050
on you know you could change somebody's
DNS

213
00:15:49,050 --> 00:15:52,579
to your DNS and and now you could I am

214
00:15:52,579 --> 00:15:55,689
start Manning you doing a man in the
middle on all the traffic

215
00:15:55,689 --> 00:15:58,959
him

216
00:15:58,959 --> 00:16:03,309
yep review bike go on a run and just get

217
00:16:03,309 --> 00:16:10,309
all other subnets your 'em

218
00:16:13,809 --> 00:16:16,809
yeah I do so at

219
00:16:16,809 --> 00:16:23,809
we gonna like clarify that that we did
this on equipment we on

220
00:16:23,860 --> 00:16:27,440
I am and that we did not try this
against anybody else in my apartment

221
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:29,500
building you're in New York City or
anywhere else in the world for that

222
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:30,320
matter

223
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:36,390
but should this be experts on the land
it would be a significant problem

224
00:16:36,390 --> 00:16:41,069
it would be really really ridiculously
easy to take control these devices

225
00:16:41,070 --> 00:16:44,890
on I hope somebody hasn't already done

226
00:16:44,890 --> 00:16:49,550
hip hop

227
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:54,329
it if they weren't exposed on the lawn

228
00:16:54,329 --> 00:16:57,380
it would be just as bad it would be a
little harder

229
00:16:57,380 --> 00:17:01,500
I'm you actually have to check some
money into opening up some HTML her

230
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:04,849
going to link or something like that are
sending the men aged Emily email

231
00:17:04,849 --> 00:17:08,438
be little tougher you have to actually
targets on these people

232
00:17:08,439 --> 00:17:11,929
and but of course

233
00:17:11,929 --> 00:17:14,939
that's not necessarily that difficult
and

234
00:17:14,939 --> 00:17:21,939
we tried really hard to figure out a way
to tell you as they have to fix this

235
00:17:23,589 --> 00:17:26,599
on because

236
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:30,960
I would be able to use my internet
connection without worrying about it

237
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:32,110
being hijacked a

238
00:17:32,110 --> 00:17:36,809
and sir the easiest fix would be of
course for

239
00:17:36,809 --> 00:17:40,399
her 'em some sort of her side of an
occasional be

240
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:43,809
implemented I mean even basic of would
be better

241
00:17:43,809 --> 00:17:46,928
know what's going on right now and

242
00:17:46,929 --> 00:17:50,040
you know using real session cookies not

243
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:54,720
executed on session cookies that have
the credentials built-in

244
00:17:54,720 --> 00:18:01,490
which is also happening I'm removing
this whole backdoor pass for today would

245
00:18:01,490 --> 00:18:02,620
be a good start as well

246
00:18:02,620 --> 00:18:06,030
and of course I

247
00:18:06,030 --> 00:18:09,780
remaining as technician accounts not
sure whether they're

248
00:18:09,780 --> 00:18:14,780
and of course

249
00:18:14,780 --> 00:18:18,520
if they're when port was exposed to be
good if you were in a

250
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:24,389
experts so full disclosure

251
00:18:24,390 --> 00:18:28,700
I'll we we have actively pursued
conversations with carriers

252
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:33,230
manufactures about this for months I'm

253
00:18:33,230 --> 00:18:36,559
thanks the forums on Friday somebody
finally call us

254
00:18:36,559 --> 00:18:40,928
so

255
00:18:40,929 --> 00:18:44,390
we want to give a little groove concept
demo on

256
00:18:44,390 --> 00:18:48,070
there really isn't anything magic about
this you want to be like some crazy Lee

257
00:18:48,070 --> 00:18:49,370
hacker to do what we did

258
00:18:49,370 --> 00:18:54,059
I there's no cool like shellcode it's
just

259
00:18:54,059 --> 00:18:58,040
at a fundamental ako a basic security
basic authentication

260
00:18:58,040 --> 00:19:01,850
and the fact that it's 2012 and we're
still doing this

261
00:19:01,850 --> 00:19:05,350
I was a little bit scary I'm its

262
00:19:05,350 --> 00:19:09,030
it's happened many times before with
other manufactures

263
00:19:09,030 --> 00:19:13,570
and it continues to happen so I'm

264
00:19:13,570 --> 00:19:16,668
we need to start thinking about a better
way did

265
00:19:16,669 --> 00:19:20,390
deploying cable modems us

266
00:19:20,390 --> 00:19:23,580
you have your fun and %um

267
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:27,010
close your eyes

268
00:19:27,010 --> 00:19:31,680
Tampakan you

269
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:36,890
sorry I'm

270
00:19:36,890 --> 00:19:40,440
dad house your your

271
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:47,440
no in aka so it's you just done that 30

272
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:15,520
mine

273
00:20:20,070 --> 00:20:27,070
I'm its windows doesn't automatically

274
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:35,269
sure

275
00:20:35,269 --> 00:20:39,139
I didn't say comcast and the big

276
00:20:39,139 --> 00:20:42,429
I had so II we have a

277
00:20:42,429 --> 00:20:47,460
week I had gotten this moment I'm

278
00:20:47,460 --> 00:20:50,690
but

279
00:20:50,690 --> 00:20:54,860
sim no comment I'm

280
00:20:54,860 --> 00:20:58,279
said week i got really the ice for my
prior when

281
00:20:58,279 --> 00:21:02,409
where and I got my cable service and
then as I went to end the inning we

282
00:21:02,409 --> 00:21:05,899
you know I'd stare the WEP WPA key
really long time in

283
00:21:05,899 --> 00:21:09,720
and when I realize their I can get in in
that on

284
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:13,789
I'm I really was kinda scared about
security office denies that we decide on

285
00:21:13,789 --> 00:21:15,760
your own and test this out so

286
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:19,960
a what showing you his learn devices in
around test Marmont

287
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:24,830
I third right now you're staying at a
party the

288
00:21:24,830 --> 00:21:28,139
up admin login Inc

289
00:21:28,139 --> 00:21:32,190
a router configure it were we have just
like the

290
00:21:32,190 --> 00:21:36,000
the record in Assange's 'em

291
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:41,090
set on the router so what we're gonna do
special exploit which

292
00:21:41,090 --> 00:21:45,709
on %um by going to our website changes
all the configs on the router

293
00:21:45,710 --> 00:21:52,470
in one second cuz

294
00:21:52,470 --> 00:21:55,559
I'm sure the session has timed and I'm
gonna need to find the password again

295
00:21:55,559 --> 00:22:02,559
anybody on

296
00:22:02,929 --> 00:22:05,990
that it's one thing we didn't have time
to test whether or not the

297
00:22:05,990 --> 00:22:10,010
devices still enables the web interface
when bridges enabled

298
00:22:10,010 --> 00:22:17,010
it be

299
00:22:21,239 --> 00:22:25,779
things mine yeah I think sir yeah from

300
00:22:25,779 --> 00:22:31,989
from the test set up to we can confirm
yes too big sample size

301
00:22:31,989 --> 00:22:38,989
sorry

302
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:47,000
on I don't know

303
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:51,210
I think that's something else I here

304
00:22:51,210 --> 00:22:54,559
the resolution the law so I'm not nobles
scroller

305
00:22:54,559 --> 00:23:01,559
I am

306
00:23:04,410 --> 00:23:08,480
it's off the screen ocean

307
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:13,250
there's the Anderson the router I think
that's the DHCP range

308
00:23:13,250 --> 00:23:20,250
yen

309
00:23:22,399 --> 00:23:25,449
good point

310
00:23:25,449 --> 00:23:29,160
up

311
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:31,470
point

312
00:23:31,470 --> 00:23:36,380
so it rental script for a quick away
shop

313
00:23:36,380 --> 00:23:43,380
you know refresh is the Brahmin live
demos

314
00:23:44,390 --> 00:23:48,830
I think the Refresh so let's go be let's
give a kid really is

315
00:23:48,830 --> 00:23:55,830
hanukah I can remember the password

316
00:23:57,230 --> 00:24:04,230
in

317
00:24:06,950 --> 00:24:13,950
you she

318
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:19,559
but this doesn't work well to set a
cookie ok

319
00:24:19,559 --> 00:24:22,870
I know who's perceptions

320
00:24:22,870 --> 00:24:26,140
him

321
00:24:26,140 --> 00:24:30,289
Kasim the same

322
00:24:30,289 --> 00:24:34,779
years X the greasy will look it up

323
00:24:34,779 --> 00:24:39,070
as we have some time ago with your

324
00:24:39,070 --> 00:24:46,070
talk amongst yourselves please

325
00:24:46,750 --> 00:24:53,750
I believe around 80 to 100 bucks from
there here

326
00:24:54,210 --> 00:25:01,210
even

327
00:25:01,490 --> 00:25:08,490
i dinna

328
00:25:09,470 --> 00:25:11,280
corrected

329
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:14,928
to

330
00:25:14,929 --> 00:25:16,750
we recall demo going that

331
00:25:16,750 --> 00:25:20,390
not working right now but basically it
was taking a screenshot on the device

332
00:25:20,390 --> 00:25:21,130
after it

333
00:25:21,130 --> 00:25:24,370
it was being fished and something that's
been shipped back to us

334
00:25:24,370 --> 00:25:28,659
to bed as a grim good

335
00:25:28,659 --> 00:25:32,850
it seems

336
00:25:32,850 --> 00:25:35,960
well tourism as the division's

337
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:42,960
for them

338
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:51,880
on

339
00:25:58,210 --> 00:26:05,210
on

340
00:26:07,060 --> 00:26:08,020
serb

341
00:26:08,020 --> 00:26:12,139
you'll see the top DNS servers changed I
am

342
00:26:12,140 --> 00:26:19,140
William we had on the AT&T one before
likely that's Open DNS now my DNS server

343
00:26:20,770 --> 00:26:27,770
but sir

344
00:26:32,999 --> 00:26:36,389
yeah hurt on

345
00:26:36,389 --> 00:26:39,479
the has bigger problems on

346
00:26:39,479 --> 00:26:46,309
I we haven't tried

347
00:26:46,309 --> 00:26:52,010
home

348
00:26:52,010 --> 00:26:59,010
weekend slacked off on this cuz it was
just so easy up

349
00:27:07,770 --> 00:27:11,790
so said that no one thinks there's only
kinda alluded to it here is that

350
00:27:11,790 --> 00:27:15,700
if this kinda disables itself when you
put the device in bridge mode

351
00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:19,410
it would probably be the easiest fix and
you just put your own

352
00:27:19,410 --> 00:27:22,880
you know router firewall behind it
something nice and secure an open-source

353
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:27,950
on but as a break now

354
00:27:27,950 --> 00:27:34,230
I the only way to really pull a test
that would be tested on my actual

355
00:27:34,230 --> 00:27:37,780
on provider issue allies in

356
00:27:37,780 --> 00:27:42,389
I'm not willing to do that sir him

357
00:27:42,390 --> 00:27:47,670
your I'm

358
00:27:47,670 --> 00:27:50,540
yeah I believe they have some sort like
a Mac

359
00:27:50,540 --> 00:27:54,870
a yeah there and

360
00:27:54,870 --> 00:28:01,870
yep them

361
00:28:02,590 --> 00:28:05,830
aside yep

362
00:28:05,830 --> 00:28:10,340
was

363
00:28:10,340 --> 00:28:15,500
supposedly you can only put your device
behind their device

364
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:20,670
at least that's what I was told up

365
00:28:20,670 --> 00:28:27,670
right well

366
00:28:32,780 --> 00:28:37,430
we turn out the lights as concrete be
talkin the all yeah I can talk in like

367
00:28:37,430 --> 00:28:44,430
good

368
00:28:46,230 --> 00:28:49,710
I'm so the people I contact me where
really manufacture

369
00:28:49,710 --> 00:28:53,750
as well as on one or the other providers
that me

370
00:28:53,750 --> 00:28:57,310
have been affected by this on

371
00:28:57,310 --> 00:29:00,649
one on

372
00:29:00,650 --> 00:29:04,010
that the one other interesting fact is
is we win al

373
00:29:04,010 --> 00:29:07,230
on shown in if you are not familiar with
its

374
00:29:07,230 --> 00:29:10,950
it's great repository for seeing what's
out there on the web

375
00:29:10,950 --> 00:29:14,820
it's likely concept and maps can I guess
that's a good way to

376
00:29:14,820 --> 00:29:19,030
explain it it's like one big Peter
database and

377
00:29:19,030 --> 00:29:22,120
so you search for just this particular
manufacturer you can

378
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:25,810
I think we felt like a hundred sixty
thousand devices on

379
00:29:25,810 --> 00:29:30,000
the interesting thing about pat was that
the only way that shit and was able to

380
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,460
find the devices

381
00:29:31,460 --> 00:29:35,890
was by actually querying and native S&P

382
00:29:35,890 --> 00:29:39,820
'em during a visit to be Trapster

383
00:29:39,820 --> 00:29:45,740
ours but when the way it is our ship
date in have S&P enabled but it seems as

384
00:29:45,740 --> 00:29:49,490
though there's a hundred some thousand
places that just have made it as an MP

385
00:29:49,490 --> 00:29:54,060
enabled 'em I had hoped that

386
00:29:54,060 --> 00:29:57,060
you know maybe they're not all

387
00:29:57,060 --> 00:30:00,830
wide open to being exploited resident p

388
00:30:00,830 --> 00:30:05,679
the way that this web services butter it
certainly could be a problem

389
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:09,290
so I'm wondering

390
00:30:09,290 --> 00:30:12,430
is it turns out did mom

391
00:30:12,430 --> 00:30:16,710
the worst case scenario the bridge mode
dozen turn

392
00:30:16,710 --> 00:30:20,680
make the device more secure unit is
expose on the way and poured

393
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:24,240
arm if you can on

394
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:27,840
secured the device at the cable company
has given you

395
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:31,650
arm would you will these be able to

396
00:30:31,650 --> 00:30:37,710
the tax that someone is messing with
your router from the women behind in

397
00:30:37,710 --> 00:30:41,350
that certain hard question to answer
because you could

398
00:30:41,350 --> 00:30:45,430
one of the things you do think it's
Senate l2tp tunnel tierOne

399
00:30:45,430 --> 00:30:49,660
I'm services Marin just call the traffic
on to lace up

400
00:30:49,660 --> 00:30:52,870
if it's in bridge mode probably on

401
00:30:52,870 --> 00:30:56,950
doubt that would work but on I

402
00:30:56,950 --> 00:31:00,330
if you just please utilize behind it
without in bridge mode I'm

403
00:31:00,330 --> 00:31:03,090
I'm not sure you would know unless
you're checking your device every day to

404
00:31:03,090 --> 00:31:03,740
make sure

405
00:31:03,740 --> 00:31:06,940
settings had been altered especially
being assigned

406
00:31:06,940 --> 00:31:09,960
on a that might

407
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:12,960
that X we might not work so well if
you're

408
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:16,380
hard during your DNS on on your end
point devices but

409
00:31:16,380 --> 00:31:20,070
a certainly with the tunneling

410
00:31:20,070 --> 00:31:23,800
it would be to just pass on all your
traffic on certain the malicious

411
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:29,850
server and I guess is a sign up to that
is there any way that

412
00:31:29,850 --> 00:31:35,070
I'm someone is compromise device could
actually enlists the

413
00:31:35,070 --> 00:31:40,139
I'm basically root the device is opposes
changing the settings

414
00:31:40,140 --> 00:31:45,880
but we haven't found a way to you

415
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:49,470
pretty firm on the way said we have
tried to

416
00:31:49,470 --> 00:31:53,190
it my guess directly

417
00:31:53,190 --> 00:31:58,540
maybe been yet

418
00:31:58,540 --> 00:32:03,350
so what are the local cable companies

419
00:32:03,350 --> 00:32:07,340
gives us gives the non wifi version to
the customer

420
00:32:07,340 --> 00:32:10,790
the pay for the high-speed service and

421
00:32:10,790 --> 00:32:14,649
I was playing with mine this morning
didn't know the pass for the day but was

422
00:32:14,650 --> 00:32:17,290
looking at other settings in a corset
has its DNS server

423
00:32:17,290 --> 00:32:20,320
and it's just a number and

424
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:24,939
I have no idea as a customer with the
correct DNS server number is because

425
00:32:24,940 --> 00:32:25,940
it's just a number

426
00:32:25,940 --> 00:32:29,850
so how would people ever really figure
out give them

427
00:32:29,850 --> 00:32:33,770
had this changed on them for men in the
attack whiz

428
00:32:33,770 --> 00:32:37,580
the cable companies don't even tell you
what the senator supposed to be

429
00:32:37,580 --> 00:32:43,240
so how do you know the legit one I think
the average customer is a very hard time

430
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:46,360
even grasping back on sir

431
00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:50,020
happen if you grab the concert be used
upon I did everything I don't you know I

432
00:32:50,020 --> 00:32:50,290
don't

433
00:32:50,290 --> 00:32:54,190
I think that's a a common problem you
know internet wine

434
00:32:54,190 --> 00:32:58,950
but certainly 'em be on the the average

435
00:32:58,950 --> 00:33:02,550
consumer would not be aware that this
was going on on

436
00:33:02,550 --> 00:33:07,980
yet so for like for my pick up a ride or
they can

437
00:33:07,980 --> 00:33:11,010
they couldn't even Morgan because
there's no

438
00:33:11,010 --> 00:33:14,560
credentials given so I am

439
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:17,620
yeah even with the very first

440
00:33:17,620 --> 00:33:21,030
a exploit that we started with marilyn
explode but

441
00:33:21,030 --> 00:33:24,450
with the weakness in the WPA password

442
00:33:24,450 --> 00:33:27,720
you know the average customer couldn't
even change that a

443
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:31,640
my provider actually I I don't remember
whether this was the case with the

444
00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:34,850
reader for my camera but I just
basically said I have a problem

445
00:33:34,850 --> 00:33:39,090
and I need I need the password and and
they gave me the password

446
00:33:39,090 --> 00:33:44,220
but now that I have that a storm's

447
00:33:44,220 --> 00:33:47,540
that on

448
00:33:47,540 --> 00:33:51,710
so at home I I have my router in bridge
mode from Comcast because

449
00:33:51,710 --> 00:33:55,990
eyes one use my own rather anyways what
do all their crap arm

450
00:33:55,990 --> 00:33:59,360
it seems like in this situation if you
go in bridge mode they're gonna have to

451
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:00,360
have to

452
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:03,980
the web interface on its hard to get
back out Ridge Road there's no interface

453
00:34:03,980 --> 00:34:05,190
to manage that

454
00:34:05,190 --> 00:34:09,080
units that brings a good point when I
talk to my provider that they said the

455
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:09,620
bay

456
00:34:09,620 --> 00:34:12,929
would they would enable the bridge mode
forming so

457
00:34:12,929 --> 00:34:16,379
I was in that they must have some way to
disable it again

458
00:34:16,380 --> 00:34:21,040
miserly web UI also it if they try and
bridge mode for you by having his moms

459
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:21,500
out

460
00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:26,190
fried rice at my home network so a
different subnet and whatever their

461
00:34:26,190 --> 00:34:27,850
default addresses some

462
00:34:27,850 --> 00:34:31,520
not machines can talk to aids don't ever
do that

463
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:38,520
SRF to me or whatever yeah anyone acting
adjutant dislikes at the ID one of them

464
00:34:39,409 --> 00:34:43,299
thanks days said that they would

465
00:34:43,300 --> 00:34:47,770
the do certain things for you if you are
under attack

466
00:34:47,770 --> 00:34:53,179
is really really comment there

467
00:34:53,179 --> 00:34:57,330
he also said that all my birds were open
by the fall

468
00:34:57,330 --> 00:35:01,540
did did you ever tried telling them you
were under attack in seeing what

469
00:35:01,540 --> 00:35:02,240
happened

470
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:07,390
but no I did not I'll I was under attack
as far as I knew

471
00:35:07,390 --> 00:35:11,620
in but the on Miller

472
00:35:11,620 --> 00:35:18,620
and the researcher not the attacker I

473
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:23,730
my my experiences some work under yours
in there

474
00:35:23,730 --> 00:35:28,470
'em many of these providers allow you to
install your own DOCSIS compatible

475
00:35:28,470 --> 00:35:32,820
device where to buy a device which is
identical to the one that they ship you

476
00:35:32,820 --> 00:35:36,210
and then they tell you exactly how to
configure it in terms of

477
00:35:36,210 --> 00:35:40,060
you know where their DNS servers are
correct

478
00:35:40,060 --> 00:35:43,700
night and into the tarmac address
sometimes they

479
00:35:43,700 --> 00:35:46,800
you know reflash it for you over the
wire so that they can

480
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:50,110
put in capacity limiting code have their
own

481
00:35:50,110 --> 00:35:53,160
yup so %um overuse their purse partly

482
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:56,710
line but done

483
00:35:56,710 --> 00:36:01,010
and in response to the person who didn't
know what the IP address meant

484
00:36:01,010 --> 00:36:04,260
there is who is there is you know trace
route

485
00:36:04,260 --> 00:36:09,270
in you can figure out your that machine
is in there cloud infrastructure in

486
00:36:09,270 --> 00:36:12,360
you can generally look at their website

487
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:19,360
and figure out how to configure your
device you being

488
00:36:20,780 --> 00:36:24,720
yeah I mean if if wanna their
infrastructure machines

489
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:29,000
is running room DNS that you might find
it hard to distinguish between that and

490
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:29,860
what's in your

491
00:36:29,860 --> 00:36:32,920
and you can always pointed a dater Open
DNS

492
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:37,230
could you wanna trustworthy deion it did
you can log into the vice

493
00:36:37,230 --> 00:36:44,230
the big in

494
00:36:46,220 --> 00:36:48,520
like

495
00:36:48,520 --> 00:36:51,000
me

496
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:56,140
them

497
00:36:56,140 --> 00:36:58,259
good

498
00:36:58,259 --> 00:37:02,670
argued that

499
00:37:02,670 --> 00:37:09,670
could

500
00:37:09,930 --> 00:37:15,830
you know

501
00:37:15,830 --> 00:37:19,609
good

502
00:37:19,609 --> 00:37:22,058
work

503
00:37:22,059 --> 00:37:25,809
up

504
00:37:25,809 --> 00:37:27,430
and a really good week answers

505
00:37:27,430 --> 00:37:30,470
model I'm

506
00:37:30,470 --> 00:37:37,470
should

507
00:37:38,290 --> 00:37:42,440
on I the question is can the cable
company detected

508
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:45,609
whether or not you made changes to the
device I am

509
00:37:45,609 --> 00:37:49,069
IIT possibly a if the

510
00:37:49,070 --> 00:37:53,130
if they have any sort remote management
facilities had to change your settings

511
00:37:53,130 --> 00:37:57,349
so where do we know it we go again to

512
00:37:57,349 --> 00:38:01,650
test environment Island are doing this
elaborate on equipment

513
00:38:01,650 --> 00:38:06,230
deep

514
00:38:06,230 --> 00:38:13,230
cracked yeah

515
00:38:21,170 --> 00:38:25,240
and mac address as friend I'm in the
worst as the DNS

516
00:38:25,240 --> 00:38:28,370
the read it was the most fun

517
00:38:28,370 --> 00:38:32,230
admin password says months youth changes
technician password yes

518
00:38:32,230 --> 00:38:35,580
you're a cutie and I was there was nice
seeing this query the passer in clear

519
00:38:35,580 --> 00:38:36,420
text and

520
00:38:36,420 --> 00:38:41,100
and Ceasar I'm directly if you news your
provider and you had some additional

521
00:38:41,100 --> 00:38:43,299
counts in there for technicians are 19

522
00:38:43,300 --> 00:38:46,920
I am you could you could create these

523
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:49,760
accounts get the passwords and hopefully
those passwords are different on

524
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:50,710
different places

525
00:38:50,710 --> 00:38:57,710
I'm we did we have a discrepancy matt
said

526
00:38:57,760 --> 00:39:01,310
charlie's 'em shipped with telnet
enabled

527
00:39:01,310 --> 00:39:05,170
'em mine shipped with only the web
interface

528
00:39:05,170 --> 00:39:12,170
I

529
00:39:13,770 --> 00:39:19,480
no comment it appears we learn expects
to

530
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:22,840
said see didn't make it clear in the
talk you said that you know the worst

531
00:39:22,840 --> 00:39:24,760
case there in the second worst case
scenario but

532
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:29,130
in your experience with these devices
was this interface actually available on

533
00:39:29,130 --> 00:39:31,530
the public IP or was it only bill on the
lawn

534
00:39:31,530 --> 00:39:35,330
obviously you know they're both problems
but one is a much bigger problem I

535
00:39:35,330 --> 00:39:37,390
because it requires no interaction grub

536
00:39:37,390 --> 00:39:41,779
I'm gonna refrain from answering the
question

537
00:39:41,780 --> 00:39:46,700
because we weren't workers yesterday a

538
00:39:46,700 --> 00:39:50,690
I on things

539
00:39:50,690 --> 00:39:57,690
yeah did at sixty corrected

540
00:39:59,250 --> 00:40:06,250
you can ask our suburban him

541
00:40:14,849 --> 00:40:15,780
on

542
00:40:15,780 --> 00:40:20,390
Chur I'm hoping says that yesterday to
be greater

543
00:40:20,390 --> 00:40:27,390
I'd really like to turn my internet
connection icon

544
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:37,180
by I was important to anything I

545
00:40:37,180 --> 00:40:40,700
actually on a square by the folks we
spoke with word

546
00:40:40,700 --> 00:40:45,400
extremely on friendly and cooperative
and we're truly concerned about the

547
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:46,079
problem

548
00:40:46,079 --> 00:40:49,569
I but the

549
00:40:49,569 --> 00:40:54,480
and in not all the providers have been
in contact with those who

550
00:40:54,480 --> 00:41:01,480
that may be affected by this up

551
00:41:06,119 --> 00:41:10,690
so which had a really long time to you

552
00:41:10,690 --> 00:41:14,790
to get in contact with people it proved
to be really difficult

553
00:41:14,790 --> 00:41:19,270
on to come with the number one lesson
learned from this for

554
00:41:19,270 --> 00:41:23,420
but many factors and providers is that
it would be really helpful if there was

555
00:41:23,420 --> 00:41:26,270
a place on your website for security
researchers

556
00:41:26,270 --> 00:41:30,330
to you submit own abilities to work with
you directly

557
00:41:30,330 --> 00:41:34,490
on to be able to facilitate community
that made

558
00:41:34,490 --> 00:41:37,660
more secure computing for just the
general public

559
00:41:37,660 --> 00:41:42,098
I'm making it impossible to get to
somebody I just

560
00:41:42,099 --> 00:41:46,490
not not agrees practice and maybe which
is not skilled enough getting through to

561
00:41:46,490 --> 00:41:47,750
the people that meet certain

562
00:41:47,750 --> 00:41:51,830
listen to us but his be certainly wasn't
easy we tried

563
00:41:51,830 --> 00:41:56,150
the scouring the web for you know
internal email addresses we call the

564
00:41:56,150 --> 00:41:57,470
sport lines we

565
00:41:57,470 --> 00:42:01,490
sent mail to standard abuse at in
security at

566
00:42:01,490 --> 00:42:06,380
'em it he you know if you take them I
love alive

567
00:42:06,380 --> 00:42:10,260
I web companies you know whether it be

568
00:42:10,260 --> 00:42:14,750
a.m. hacking competition in a rather be
in the

569
00:42:14,750 --> 00:42:18,050
I think people have something like a
bounty program

570
00:42:18,050 --> 00:42:21,060
weird you can test in their send

571
00:42:21,060 --> 00:42:24,570
sandbox environment and report model is
very easily

572
00:42:24,570 --> 00:42:28,180
I've had that same mentality existed a

573
00:42:28,180 --> 00:42:35,180
it would be I think beneficial to
everybody

574
00:42:41,650 --> 00:42:45,000
millions been maybe we won't go

575
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:49,030
so I guess the question is did for call
you or did you call for

576
00:42:49,030 --> 00:42:53,540
Nicolas how did they find out about them

577
00:42:53,540 --> 00:43:00,540
the talk hope been

578
00:43:01,390 --> 00:43:05,470
is boards in the room in

579
00:43:05,470 --> 00:43:12,470
a

580
00:43:14,140 --> 00:43:20,549
agreed and no more questions occurring
please don't cut
