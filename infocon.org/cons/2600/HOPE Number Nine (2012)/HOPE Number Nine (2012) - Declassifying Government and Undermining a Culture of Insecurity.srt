1
00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:03,040
came today on declassifying government

2
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:06,048
undermining culture in security

3
00:00:06,049 --> 00:00:10,300
as opposed to cultural secured I'll

4
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:14,719
a minute talk a lot about the freedom
Information Act which are used to write

5
00:00:14,719 --> 00:00:15,670
two books

6
00:00:15,670 --> 00:00:19,369
this came out last month surveillance in
america

7
00:00:19,369 --> 00:00:22,410
a critical analysis of the FBI

8
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:27,070
1922 the president's I've been

9
00:00:27,070 --> 00:00:30,939
working pretty busy with this one came
out in 2010

10
00:00:30,939 --> 00:00:36,620
the dangers of dissent the FBI and civil
liberties since 1965

11
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:40,589
so these two books

12
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:45,239
on the first floor talk about eight
years

13
00:00:45,239 --> 00:00:48,610
research in writing though I didn't work
on it

14
00:00:48,610 --> 00:00:52,789
24 hours a day and the second book talk
about two years

15
00:00:52,789 --> 00:00:56,989
I done a lot of other requesting the
files already

16
00:00:56,989 --> 00:01:00,100
much better process

17
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:05,840
I'll why

18
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:11,049
are for your files especially FBI files
very important to obtain

19
00:01:11,049 --> 00:01:14,369
for the public why should the public to
obtain well

20
00:01:14,369 --> 00:01:18,630
to write their history of the FBI you
need these files

21
00:01:18,630 --> 00:01:21,830
and to write a history of civil
liberties and surveillance you need

22
00:01:21,830 --> 00:01:22,700
these files

23
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:26,100
it's estimated there a anywhere from

24
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:31,220
to $2.4 billion pages FBI files
currently being held

25
00:01:31,220 --> 00:01:35,090
by the government the estimate varies

26
00:01:35,090 --> 00:01:38,560
depending on when you ask them what they
say I

27
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:41,829
but they've told congress at one point
2.5

28
00:01:41,829 --> 00:01:46,200
than 4.4 million I'll and how many
affinity

29
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:49,590
classified under the Freedom of
Information Act

30
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:52,759
about six million for 7

31
00:01:52,759 --> 00:01:57,670
627 and transfer to the National
Archives

32
00:01:57,670 --> 00:02:03,250
though they're not always available
Republic use about 35 so you talking

33
00:02:03,250 --> 00:02:04,689
about forty million

34
00:02:04,689 --> 00:02:07,710
pages declassified other

35
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:14,710
to 4224 billion pages of now not all
those files are investigatory files that

36
00:02:15,959 --> 00:02:18,420
not all the more related to national
security

37
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:22,459
or in security which is what I pretty
much are focusing on

38
00:02:22,459 --> 00:02:26,860
but I think general porn is a tremendous
amount of government information out

39
00:02:26,860 --> 00:02:27,370
there

40
00:02:27,370 --> 00:02:31,120
that requires the efforts of citizen
journalists

41
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:35,989
North writers and public interest
organizations to request the files to

42
00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:37,019
get the information

43
00:02:37,019 --> 00:02:41,709
once you get the information what do you
do with well you can try to write new

44
00:02:41,709 --> 00:02:42,780
narratives

45
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:45,840
I love American history based on these
files

46
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:49,430
narratives FBI history and

47
00:02:49,430 --> 00:02:54,629
create new public debates about what is
the role

48
00:02:54,629 --> 00:02:58,260
security in society in the role of the
FBI in society

49
00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:03,879
how civil liberties are impacted
compassion boys based on new debate you

50
00:03:03,879 --> 00:03:07,040
meters social movements based on new
debates

51
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:11,609
one of the things that I favor is a
social movement

52
00:03:11,610 --> 00:03:15,120
forming around anti spy

53
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:20,379
in our society a lot of people for what
we live in today s surveillance aside

54
00:03:20,379 --> 00:03:24,700
civil liberties community uses out that
word

55
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:27,769
the progressive and political organizing

56
00:03:27,769 --> 00:03:31,569
communities think we live in a civilized
society and not many people

57
00:03:31,569 --> 00:03:36,250
organizing specifically against that now
so

58
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:39,909
a if you ask me what to point to the
store one of the points

59
00:03:39,909 --> 00:03:43,940
is to encourage people to starter social
movement

60
00:03:43,940 --> 00:03:47,870
against government spy acting in lawful
and peaceful ways

61
00:03:47,870 --> 00:03:54,870
ok a back to the free love information I
made my first request in December 1999

62
00:03:56,989 --> 00:04:01,269
and since then I've made 104 requests to
the FBI

63
00:04:01,269 --> 00:04:04,610
104 I've gotten 65 miles

64
00:04:04,610 --> 00:04:08,349
and that constitute about

65
00:04:08,349 --> 00:04:11,909
forty-five thousand pages that doctor

66
00:04:11,909 --> 00:04:15,519
and these are all documents related to
domestic security

67
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:19,880
or works for 100 classifications number

68
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:24,030
for for Social Security I'm

69
00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:28,669
in the dangers of the said I used 36 FBI
files

70
00:04:28,669 --> 00:04:32,219
18 I got myself here

71
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:35,479
surveillance in america I used 59

72
00:04:35,479 --> 00:04:39,180
FBI files which 25 I got myself

73
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:44,060
now what about the other files are you

74
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:48,820
where they come from well there are
several web sites that

75
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:53,650
host government files one is the ACLU
the American Civil Liberties Union

76
00:04:53,650 --> 00:04:58,090
they had extensive where

77
00:04:58,090 --> 00:05:01,919
material on spying in surveillance and
they often pose

78
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:05,599
FBI files along with their articles
press release

79
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:10,880
another is government attic dot or which
pose files on mass

80
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:15,740
and another is the FBI website itself
there before reading room

81
00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:19,610
and since I think 1999 posting

82
00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:23,620
a bunch of files on their own site

83
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:27,520
now one note about the FBI website
before your

84
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:31,060
what they post often the complete record

85
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:35,050
a recent example is a couple weeks ago
was breaking news

86
00:05:35,050 --> 00:05:40,620
that they posted you more felts FBI file

87
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:44,220
whose fell to use P Road watergate frame

88
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:47,990
as everyone should probably buy now no
deep throat

89
00:05:47,990 --> 00:05:53,020
wasn't top FBI official mark felt leaked
information to bob woodward

90
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:57,549
coburns pose while the FBI police file
online

91
00:05:57,550 --> 00:06:02,250
and they said it was the profile they
put about eighteen hundred pages

92
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:05,639
and I had asked for that file several
years ago after more

93
00:06:05,639 --> 00:06:08,880
felt side and I think I was the first
one to get it

94
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:12,090
and they sent me over 3500

95
00:06:12,090 --> 00:06:15,419
so what they post on their

96
00:06:15,419 --> 00:06:18,990
what they decide to post is not always
full record

97
00:06:18,990 --> 00:06:22,300
now of course with the release to me may
not always be there for work

98
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:26,110
but at least in terms of no I got more
than 35

99
00:06:26,110 --> 00:06:29,850
100 page down on everything I got was
useful

100
00:06:29,850 --> 00:06:32,889
just so I I'm they had

101
00:06:32,889 --> 00:06:36,949
medical reports what he I'll

102
00:06:36,949 --> 00:06:41,039
he was a number two guy the bureau
worked his way up to number two

103
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:45,159
and that if he keeps pkg reports you
know the

104
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:50,180
is medically k to you so I was trying to
get a doctor to look at that

105
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:53,250
she said he had some paper for condition

106
00:06:53,250 --> 00:06:56,410
which wasn't issue why its server

107
00:06:56,410 --> 00:07:00,009
carry a weapon kg report there

108
00:07:00,009 --> 00:07:03,120
for the FBI didn't put that on but
they've released

109
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:07,810
to be that in they didn't send to that

110
00:07:07,810 --> 00:07:12,860
a

111
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:17,130
one was for your first pass in 1966

112
00:07:17,130 --> 00:07:21,030
but not until 1974 did federal law
enforcement

113
00:07:21,030 --> 00:07:26,949
records become subject to its
application so in 66 LBJ signed to war

114
00:07:26,949 --> 00:07:32,650
on July 4 and in 1974 congress

115
00:07:32,650 --> 00:07:36,650
at an entrance to it that apply it to
the FBI records

116
00:07:36,650 --> 00:07:40,919
why then because watergate because a lot
of scandal in government

117
00:07:40,919 --> 00:07:45,250
because a hoover J edgar hoover had died

118
00:07:45,250 --> 00:07:50,050
night some to and his various crimes on
the COINTELPRO were being

119
00:07:50,050 --> 00:07:53,789
released any information was getting to
the public so

120
00:07:53,789 --> 00:07:59,930
congress decided that opened up federal
law enforcement records for public view

121
00:07:59,930 --> 00:08:03,949
for

122
00:08:03,949 --> 00:08:08,490
was president veto the act which had the
amendments

123
00:08:08,490 --> 00:08:12,639
and congress overrode why did Ford veto
it

124
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:16,530
his main objection with confidentiality
he said

125
00:08:16,530 --> 00:08:19,789
the FBI works with a lot of people

126
00:08:19,789 --> 00:08:23,520
informers

127
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:26,849
sources third parties and therefore your

128
00:08:26,849 --> 00:08:30,419
is applied to the FBI we won't be able
to assure their

129
00:08:30,419 --> 00:08:34,218
the secrecy of those contacts and of
course

130
00:08:34,219 --> 00:08:39,419
that's a phony argument pick up when the
war was passed with the amendments

131
00:08:39,419 --> 00:08:42,490
they gave more enforcement various ways
to

132
00:08:42,490 --> 00:08:47,020
sensor worried actor blackout jury other
three goodnight exemptions

133
00:08:47,020 --> 00:08:51,130
in the war and one is for
confidentiality

134
00:08:51,130 --> 00:08:54,339
to anyone who looks at FBI files you'll
see there's lots of

135
00:08:54,339 --> 00:08:58,149
blackouts up cheerio which you can try D

136
00:08:58,149 --> 00:09:02,350
piece together on your own to find out
what it is but it's difficult

137
00:09:02,350 --> 00:09:05,490
I'll if you

138
00:09:05,490 --> 00:09:09,060
make a request to the FBI and

139
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:13,120
say you gotta 200 pages

140
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:17,610
you can appeal through the Department of
Justice

141
00:09:17,610 --> 00:09:22,900
to she if the files more anger than 200
know that free

142
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:26,569
but its prime through write a letter or
repeal and

143
00:09:26,570 --> 00:09:29,949
for the Office of Information I

144
00:09:29,949 --> 00:09:33,640
at the OJ work with the FBI to see if
they'll release more information

145
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:38,150
a a lotta researchers think about maybe
thirty percent of all

146
00:09:38,150 --> 00:09:42,029
responses initial responses 24 request

147
00:09:42,029 --> 00:09:45,439
upon appeal get more material so

148
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:50,350
this question of whether initially there
being honest when they say about 200

149
00:09:50,350 --> 00:09:51,029
pages

150
00:09:51,029 --> 00:09:56,279
or 500 pages or whatever another way
they've tried it for all the processes

151
00:09:56,279 --> 00:09:57,870
by destroying files

152
00:09:57,870 --> 00:10:00,940
anyone who studies FBI history knows

153
00:10:00,940 --> 00:10:05,170
that there's a routine process where
they save material and where they

154
00:10:05,170 --> 00:10:07,300
destroyed was sent to the shredder

155
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:14,300
there's a categoria material sent safer
historical preservation I'm although I'm

156
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:16,060
not aware the criteria

157
00:10:16,060 --> 00:10:19,589
what's considered historical and what is
it

158
00:10:19,589 --> 00:10:23,680
I found a memo in the natural archives
FBI file

159
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:27,170
that show between 1975 and 1981

160
00:10:27,170 --> 00:10:31,740
the FBI destroy 243,000 files related

161
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:34,980
domestic security so as soon as the
four-year

162
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:38,820
amendments became effective 1974

163
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:43,029
the FBI began the story a lot of files
they wouldn't have to release

164
00:10:43,029 --> 00:10:46,209
so that's 243,000

165
00:10:46,209 --> 00:10:50,070
100-plus cation files over over 75

166
00:10:50,070 --> 00:10:54,140
I found another member

167
00:10:54,140 --> 00:11:01,140
1986 to 1995 the FBI destroyed a quarter
of a billion pages

168
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:08,160
$250 million pages not files page

169
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:11,680
they listed in cubic feet and then you
translated pages

170
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:15,010
in the 100 classifications so again they

171
00:11:15,010 --> 00:11:18,339
they destroyed a lot of material another
example would be

172
00:11:18,339 --> 00:11:24,500
300,000 pages up the sex deviants
program in 1977

173
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:27,880
with the decision made to destroy that

174
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:31,079
files that program and that program was

175
00:11:31,079 --> 00:11:34,270
the FBI's investigation gays government

176
00:11:34,270 --> 00:11:39,069
federal government for many years since
I think it's a late thirties

177
00:11:39,069 --> 00:11:44,000
if you were gay for these were
homosexual but most to the attachment on

178
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,740
man there were that many women report
that they investigated that I'm aware of

179
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:54,020
a if you work if you're homosexual work
to government you could be fine they do

180
00:11:54,020 --> 00:11:55,689
more oil to investigations

181
00:11:55,689 --> 00:11:59,939
and all the records on that

182
00:11:59,939 --> 00:12:05,890
or at least 300,000 pages which another
example destroyed records you terminal

183
00:12:05,890 --> 00:12:07,640
japanese-americans

184
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:10,650
during world war 2

185
00:12:10,650 --> 00:12:14,660
and the custodial detention program
records

186
00:12:14,660 --> 00:12:20,310
the government had a system since 1939
where the event of a national emergency

187
00:12:20,310 --> 00:12:23,390
they would round up people and
indefinitely detain

188
00:12:23,390 --> 00:12:26,699
during the war during about during a
national emergency

189
00:12:26,699 --> 00:12:31,540
probably they were thinking some type of
hot war with soviet

190
00:12:31,540 --> 00:12:34,949
now at its height to about 26,000
Americans

191
00:12:34,949 --> 00:12:38,810
on the detention with and its successor
the security index

192
00:12:38,810 --> 00:12:42,150
a decade mostly communist

193
00:12:42,150 --> 00:12:46,939
socialist black power a Jimi Hendrix
made the list

194
00:12:46,939 --> 00:12:50,010
before was abolished in the early
seventies cassis its

195
00:12:50,010 --> 00:12:53,880
fundraisers I think it was for black
power black panthers

196
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:57,689
I'll college professors political
activist

197
00:12:57,689 --> 00:13:00,779
but again that was never put into affect

198
00:13:00,779 --> 00:13:04,510
never actually and just as a footnote

199
00:13:04,510 --> 00:13:08,329
Congress passed last month

200
00:13:08,329 --> 00:13:14,110
attention bill establishing pretty much
a similar system

201
00:13:14,110 --> 00:13:18,730
I'll under Obama which Obama signed with
the signing state

202
00:13:18,730 --> 00:13:23,120
I forgot the name of it attention has to
work tension in the

203
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:28,120
I'll and this would be related not to
the cold war but the war on terror

204
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:31,910
that anyone related to terrorism
potentially could be arrested and

205
00:13:31,910 --> 00:13:32,790
detained

206
00:13:32,790 --> 00:13:38,839
indefinite but there was a precedent for

207
00:13:38,839 --> 00:13:41,850
no little bit more about four

208
00:13:41,850 --> 00:13:45,199
often you'll get if you make your
request

209
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:49,180
a response as a No record our search

210
00:13:49,180 --> 00:13:53,490
has found no records well as I mean

211
00:13:53,490 --> 00:13:56,970
that means they say they have no records
now on appeal

212
00:13:56,970 --> 00:14:02,290
it's found that or first before I say
that 1998

213
00:14:02,290 --> 00:14:05,980
36 percent overall FBI responses

214
00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:09,800
24 request they said no wreck 36 percent

215
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:13,089
in 2001 up to 48 percent

216
00:14:13,089 --> 00:14:16,110
in 2004 they said 55 percent

217
00:14:16,110 --> 00:14:20,540
for request there were no records 2007

218
00:14:20,540 --> 00:14:23,750
they said 71 percent there were no

219
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:27,029
records

220
00:14:27,029 --> 00:14:31,360
when we make that in some cases really
are directors

221
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:34,890
I mean you can follow request on
yourself and

222
00:14:34,890 --> 00:14:38,900
there may be nothing a good chance to be
nothing in Leicester a leader or

223
00:14:38,900 --> 00:14:43,970
breaking from member group whose giving
speeches or held placards or

224
00:14:43,970 --> 00:14:47,220
got arrested in civil disobedience

225
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:50,459
or for some other reason but they're
really maybe you're right

226
00:14:50,459 --> 00:14:54,180
but Fort almost double over a decade

227
00:14:54,180 --> 00:14:58,170
a lot of people think they're being
disingenuous and how they respond to

228
00:14:58,170 --> 00:14:59,689
requests

229
00:14:59,689 --> 00:15:03,290
and the only way to challenge side to
appease like we said

230
00:15:03,290 --> 00:15:07,260
if you get a new record response to
appeal to the OJ

231
00:15:07,260 --> 00:15:11,089
and maybe thirty percent of the cases
records and then if that

232
00:15:11,089 --> 00:15:14,600
if you don't get anything under appeal
you consume under the Freedom of

233
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:16,390
Information Act

234
00:15:16,390 --> 00:15:20,050
file a civil lawsuit but that's
expensive time

235
00:15:20,050 --> 00:15:23,860
assuming I did it which will talk about
a little bit

236
00:15:23,860 --> 00:15:27,650
which was successful

237
00:15:27,650 --> 00:15:31,270
sometimes their partial responses are
filed a Freedom of Information Act

238
00:15:31,270 --> 00:15:32,300
request

239
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:35,770
in 2000 about 2000 project

240
00:15:35,770 --> 00:15:39,430
for project met back it go Megi

241
00:15:39,430 --> 00:15:43,790
BDO thank in the Bible

242
00:15:43,790 --> 00:15:47,120
reference Bible and that was a weather
sets with

243
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:50,730
for the millennium before the millennium
the FBI

244
00:15:50,730 --> 00:15:55,070
threat assessment is there going to be
violence when year 2000

245
00:15:55,070 --> 00:15:58,570
apart from computer crashes should

246
00:15:58,570 --> 00:16:03,360
y2k hi I'll work political groups

247
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:06,880
calls gonna turn to buy

248
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:11,670
and a analyzed a lot of existing
material around the country

249
00:16:11,670 --> 00:16:16,300
new surveillance right-wing groups and
other groups to see if they're gonna

250
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:20,560
for any violence I want to the records
on that book that I was writing

251
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:24,310
when I asked for it they sent me 10
pages

252
00:16:24,310 --> 00:16:29,630
press release just a fan page

253
00:16:29,630 --> 00:16:33,579
I another example is there was a radical

254
00:16:33,579 --> 00:16:37,110
Black Power Group for the republican new
Africa

255
00:16:37,110 --> 00:16:42,269
for R&A they were investigated under
COINTELPRO

256
00:16:42,269 --> 00:16:46,660
day after their file they got 8300 page

257
00:16:46,660 --> 00:16:51,110
the data filed a lawsuit saying that
can't be

258
00:16:51,110 --> 00:16:55,519
they got another 32,000 after they filed
a lawsuit

259
00:16:55,519 --> 00:16:59,240
and ultimately 13,000 were completely
with hell

260
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:03,410
under various exactions so they got 8

261
00:17:03,410 --> 00:17:06,418
8300 and shooting got 32

262
00:17:06,419 --> 00:17:10,209
now imagine if you if you try to write a
history or fear political activist

263
00:17:10,209 --> 00:17:14,429
wanna know what's been going on you get
8300

264
00:17:14,429 --> 00:17:18,929
that a lot that's what they've been
doing when in fact if I was over 50,000

265
00:17:18,929 --> 00:17:20,000
pages

266
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,609
once I got challenged they had a more

267
00:17:23,610 --> 00:17:29,570
tend to release

268
00:17:29,570 --> 00:17:34,049
okay I in 1999 when I made my first
request

269
00:17:34,049 --> 00:17:38,139
it was December 22nd made a note of

270
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:42,179
other 1999

271
00:17:42,179 --> 00:17:46,140
week before the millennium now I don't
know where

272
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:50,130
most people were doing that we I lived
in Manhattan

273
00:17:50,130 --> 00:17:55,909
near Columbia I was teaching

274
00:17:55,909 --> 00:17:58,970
eat

275
00:17:58,970 --> 00:18:04,059
a Empire State College future electrical
workers at your

276
00:18:04,059 --> 00:18:08,840
high school I all over them players
State College

277
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:14,189
education program and in New York City
and in Manhattan things were pretty

278
00:18:14,190 --> 00:18:18,030
a love attention a lot of anxiety

279
00:18:18,030 --> 00:18:21,760
and I am i really about civil liberties

280
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:24,890
surveillance for a while online I

281
00:18:24,890 --> 00:18:30,490
recently one online I think before I
first signed up for a while

282
00:18:30,490 --> 00:18:33,630
and I said okay let me follow request
she went out

283
00:18:33,630 --> 00:18:36,770
I file a request

284
00:18:36,770 --> 00:18:41,490
on John Jay College of Criminal Justice
which is part of the city university

285
00:18:41,490 --> 00:18:46,370
your its own West 59th Street and I had
toward in the history department there

286
00:18:46,370 --> 00:18:49,100
between 1992 and 1995

287
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:56,020
and while I was there it was common
knowledge that the FBI

288
00:18:56,020 --> 00:18:59,080
ray and the northeast regional training
facility

289
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:03,668
so the net FBI had a training facility
for all the agents from the northeast at

290
00:19:03,669 --> 00:19:04,350
the school

291
00:19:04,350 --> 00:19:10,320
located on prime missus and the agents
attended classes

292
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:15,559
and had specialized workshops and there
was a large law enforcement presence at

293
00:19:15,559 --> 00:19:16,149
the school

294
00:19:16,150 --> 00:19:19,150
and that wasn't really concealed school

295
00:19:19,150 --> 00:19:23,140
criminal justice in the criminal justice
major is largest made with the school

296
00:19:23,140 --> 00:19:28,059
I taught a class for violence social
change in the US

297
00:19:28,059 --> 00:19:31,918
a tour to Sec two different classes

298
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:35,700
and most my students with more force

299
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:38,730
so in any way in any event I wonder

300
00:19:38,730 --> 00:19:41,750
in 1999 I left the school in 1995

301
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:45,080
what they had on the school how
extensive the they weren't

302
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:50,570
new yorkers so four months later I got a
fire consisting of 16 pages

303
00:19:50,570 --> 00:19:53,840
now

304
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:57,840
obviously that's wonderful response 16
pages

305
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:02,168
some stuff about we some some organized
crime investigation

306
00:20:02,169 --> 00:20:05,740
week that was it so

307
00:20:05,740 --> 00:20:10,500
at that point it's I was an early user
before and I didn't appear but I would

308
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:11,539
imagine if they did

309
00:20:11,539 --> 00:20:14,570
on this release would be two or three
thousand-page

310
00:20:14,570 --> 00:20:18,250
depends on how they define what's
relevant

311
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:23,559
reports that in the year 2008 maybe
fifty requests

312
00:20:23,559 --> 00:20:27,980
I decided I was going to write a book
the danger that the scent

313
00:20:27,980 --> 00:20:31,549
although at first it was called troubled
times I'll

314
00:20:31,549 --> 00:20:36,899
I made about 50 request I started
reading the historical literature on the

315
00:20:36,899 --> 00:20:37,580
FBI

316
00:20:37,580 --> 00:20:41,360
to apply a thin the or harass one of the
leading

317
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:44,669
writers can authorize the war church
/url

318
00:20:44,669 --> 00:20:49,270
and I said where's the gas what we know
about the FBI what don't we know

319
00:20:49,270 --> 00:20:52,559
based on what's already in the
literature and a lot of what we don't

320
00:20:52,559 --> 00:20:55,168
know what's the modern period after
hoover died

321
00:20:55,169 --> 00:20:58,380
there's a lot of historical research on
Hoover

322
00:20:58,380 --> 00:21:03,169
J edgar hoover was head of the FBI for
1924

323
00:21:03,169 --> 00:21:07,559
when he died 7 to at 48 years

324
00:21:07,559 --> 00:21:11,020
his head what happened after

325
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:17,200
the FBI change after he died after Co
Intel pro the notorious fine program and

326
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:21,330
after the congress investigated the FBI
the church committee hearings in the

327
00:21:21,330 --> 00:21:22,039
seventies

328
00:21:22,039 --> 00:21:25,190
what happened after that not a lot of
people

329
00:21:25,190 --> 00:21:28,309
written on that so I started making
request

330
00:21:28,309 --> 00:21:31,370
on politically active groups in the late
seventies and eighties

331
00:21:31,370 --> 00:21:35,000
would accrue for Witness for Peace

332
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:38,350
is a small group something which I knew

333
00:21:38,350 --> 00:21:42,200
because I was on the margins awesome
protest the eighties

334
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:45,240
Central America nunnery like this but on
the margins

335
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:49,220
Witness for Peace they had a 57 pagefile

336
00:21:49,220 --> 00:21:54,510
the pledge of resistance that was a
group organized that if we invaded

337
00:21:54,510 --> 00:21:55,580
nicaragua

338
00:21:55,580 --> 00:22:01,168
people were gonna pledge to commit civil
disobedience 17 pages

339
00:22:01,169 --> 00:22:04,669
klaus shares eight pages

340
00:22:04,669 --> 00:22:08,590
that's clearly a partial release the
Ploughshares was

341
00:22:08,590 --> 00:22:11,959
a anti-war group back

342
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:15,490
gauged illegal civil disobedience
military sites

343
00:22:15,490 --> 00:22:21,419
they were their religious Americans were
involved they would go to a military

344
00:22:21,419 --> 00:22:22,419
side

345
00:22:22,419 --> 00:22:25,840
break it stay there for their blood

346
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:30,168
on missile has and solder the idea was
to become

347
00:22:30,169 --> 00:22:33,880
to get arrested from prisoners political
prisoners in their view

348
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:37,610
and to pour their water two missiles

349
00:22:37,610 --> 00:22:42,510
peaceful so I get eight pages on them
when

350
00:22:42,510 --> 00:22:45,510
there were about a hundred actions like
that

351
00:22:45,510 --> 00:22:49,889
100 different civil disobedience by sure
that after they sent me

352
00:22:49,889 --> 00:22:54,639
eight pages on a group outings in the
midwest

353
00:22:54,639 --> 00:22:58,290
Peter 18 pages

354
00:22:58,290 --> 00:23:01,700
now I made that request in the year two
thousand but

355
00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:05,139
even then that seemed like a partial
response

356
00:23:05,139 --> 00:23:09,020
it would be several hundred these in the
year two thousand have a repressive

357
00:23:09,020 --> 00:23:13,360
the file since other people have
Greenpeace

358
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:16,809
eighty pages 89 pages

359
00:23:16,809 --> 00:23:22,299
and I made that request in the year two
thousand they talked about BP's USA

360
00:23:22,299 --> 00:23:25,330
I the Socialist Workers Party

361
00:23:25,330 --> 00:23:29,120
which is a small trotsky I party

362
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:32,909
their anti-soviet about pro Trotsky a
socialist

363
00:23:32,909 --> 00:23:36,590
they've been investigated since the
forties

364
00:23:36,590 --> 00:23:40,139
the estimate that they have their files
eight million pagers

365
00:23:40,139 --> 00:23:44,649
well after 1975 they sent me about seven
hundred page

366
00:23:44,649 --> 00:23:47,840
so they were still investigated by to

367
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:52,020
but at a smaller level got small

368
00:23:52,020 --> 00:23:56,000
know anyone who knows Gus Hall he was a
leader of the Communist Party

369
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:59,090
at the United States for many years

370
00:23:59,090 --> 00:24:03,889
and he died in nineteen ninety so I was
able to ask for his file

371
00:24:03,889 --> 00:24:07,450
when you write a letter on on a person
other than yourself you need to have an

372
00:24:07,450 --> 00:24:08,250
obituary

373
00:24:08,250 --> 00:24:12,919
approve death after he died I got is a
bitch where r

374
00:24:12,919 --> 00:24:17,350
after his file only since 1976

375
00:24:17,350 --> 00:24:22,080
and he was still investigating 819
pagers

376
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:28,260
the one thing about the glass full of
I'll file

377
00:24:28,260 --> 00:24:32,110
they didn't they suspended their
investigations when he ran for president

378
00:24:32,110 --> 00:24:36,500
each year he ran for president on the
Communist Party ticket

379
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:39,590
five or ten thousand votes more but

380
00:24:39,590 --> 00:24:42,629
over a three-month period right before
the general election

381
00:24:42,630 --> 00:24:47,370
they would suspend the investigation
because presidential

382
00:24:47,370 --> 00:24:50,669
so there was about a three month time
period before each election

383
00:24:50,669 --> 00:24:55,970
and then there were any loss they
resumed again

384
00:24:55,970 --> 00:24:59,970
so if you think you under investigation
you want them spender

385
00:24:59,970 --> 00:25:03,049
run for president

386
00:25:03,049 --> 00:25:07,190
I'll same the committee for saying
nuclear policy

387
00:25:07,190 --> 00:25:11,929
they said no records the gay men's
health crisis

388
00:25:11,929 --> 00:25:16,260
in New York City there was a press
report AP Reno report that there was an

389
00:25:16,260 --> 00:25:17,710
FBI investigation

390
00:25:17,710 --> 00:25:22,570
them they told me know records the
Audubon Society

391
00:25:22,570 --> 00:25:26,649
ronald reagan had said they were led by
communist that the comment

392
00:25:26,649 --> 00:25:30,770
what about the side nuclear freeze the
air croc log

393
00:25:30,770 --> 00:25:35,500
no records the world's so when the
danger that the fat I said Reagan said

394
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:37,929
that dominated by communists but the FBI

395
00:25:37,929 --> 00:25:42,340
no proof that where did you get that
charger

396
00:25:42,340 --> 00:25:47,220
me the pre on the lawsuit

397
00:25:47,220 --> 00:25:51,820
or any questions one week F if anyone
wants to ask any questions at this point

398
00:25:51,820 --> 00:25:53,350
think we're about

399
00:25:53,350 --> 00:26:00,350
halfway

400
00:26:05,670 --> 00:26:12,670
I wonder if they headed in the article
yes

401
00:26:21,660 --> 00:26:25,730
well once they process want a process a
request

402
00:26:25,730 --> 00:26:30,340
its if someone else after the file they
have it already process so yes

403
00:26:30,340 --> 00:26:33,820
but in that case it didn't process it
for me separate press release

404
00:26:33,820 --> 00:26:37,879
but if you ask for a file on someone's
already asked for them to speed up the

405
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:40,980
process because they don't usually go
through the whole process again it's

406
00:26:40,980 --> 00:26:41,920
been preprocessed

407
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:47,890
any other but your want

408
00:26:47,890 --> 00:26:51,930
two-page letter saying I appeal was
under the Freedom of Information Act I

409
00:26:51,930 --> 00:26:53,990
have reason to believe that records or

410
00:26:53,990 --> 00:26:57,310
that you did do a full search and that
you try to give your reasons why you

411
00:26:57,310 --> 00:27:01,000
think that it's not a a proper search

412
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:04,910
well why wreckage really do exist say I
read in the newspaper that

413
00:27:04,910 --> 00:27:09,740
there was an investigation that would be
a reason or I think the records

414
00:27:09,740 --> 00:27:16,740
spoarer files just because this any
other yeah

415
00:27:44,460 --> 00:27:46,520
hearing today

416
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:51,860
I

417
00:27:51,860 --> 00:27:55,050
there was an article in the paper last
week that

418
00:27:55,050 --> 00:27:58,830
the FBI made 1.3 million request

419
00:27:58,830 --> 00:28:02,350
to was an Internet Service Provider
phone companies

420
00:28:02,350 --> 00:28:06,000
anyone's which one phone companies

421
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:09,710
1.3 million requests for phone records
other

422
00:28:09,710 --> 00:28:13,070
not the actual conversations probably
about records to an

423
00:28:13,070 --> 00:28:17,370
information you call and for Jude

424
00:28:17,370 --> 00:28:24,280
conversation so 1.3 million now that's
not just political that's also organize

425
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:26,649
cry

426
00:28:26,650 --> 00:28:29,800
by thats that's a mass surveillance

427
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:34,140
1.3 million requests I

428
00:28:34,140 --> 00:28:37,780
was Occupy Wall Street under
surveillance that's a question that a

429
00:28:37,780 --> 00:28:39,530
lot researchers are trying to

430
00:28:39,530 --> 00:28:44,410
figure out right now is a online there's
a group a site truth out

431
00:28:44,410 --> 00:28:48,790
they've had a couple of articles this
some documents released that show that

432
00:28:48,790 --> 00:28:52,750
there are references to the Occupy Wall
Street in New York in different cities

433
00:28:52,750 --> 00:28:57,620
the FBI showing up in doing so rather
keeping records but neither that's

434
00:28:57,620 --> 00:28:59,110
really been released yet

435
00:28:59,110 --> 00:29:02,190
that's a good foreigners research for
the future

436
00:29:02,190 --> 00:29:09,190
are many other yeah

437
00:29:14,310 --> 00:29:18,460
they used to be on pay in then in about
2006

438
00:29:18,460 --> 00:29:22,050
they started releasing them on CD-rom
electron

439
00:29:22,050 --> 00:29:26,580
I'll and that was a big cherry

440
00:29:26,580 --> 00:29:30,050
and that's actually a good way to lead
into my loss

441
00:29:30,050 --> 00:29:37,050
to let me let me do that that a fully
awfully yeah

442
00:29:57,049 --> 00:30:00,549
well they did why did they do

443
00:30:00,549 --> 00:30:05,179
why did that delay is a strategy it's an
institutional strategy because a lot of

444
00:30:05,179 --> 00:30:08,210
journalists use a Freedom of Information
Act for this story

445
00:30:08,210 --> 00:30:11,750
and if you have a deadline you working
on a story a month

446
00:30:11,750 --> 00:30:15,360
and then you when it all the obstacles
will give you the

447
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:19,309
the store the information in three
months or former miss it for your

448
00:30:19,309 --> 00:30:21,340
deadline so

449
00:30:21,340 --> 00:30:25,509
a lot of it is too liberal their
officially complying with the more they

450
00:30:25,509 --> 00:30:26,129
say

451
00:30:26,129 --> 00:30:29,220
I but they're making him make you jump
through hoops

452
00:30:29,220 --> 00:30:32,909
true make a disincentive to UCI

453
00:30:32,909 --> 00:30:36,169
up only by suing appeal

454
00:30:36,169 --> 00:30:43,169
sorry

455
00:30:43,910 --> 00:30:47,860
stop in da not that I know you mean like
a class action or something like that

456
00:30:47,860 --> 00:30:48,650
challenging the whole

457
00:30:48,650 --> 00:30:52,150
that would I guess have to be a supreme
court probably a model

458
00:30:52,150 --> 00:30:56,460
attorney a lawyer but I think someone
would have to bring a legal case and

459
00:30:56,460 --> 00:30:57,700
decide the courts without

460
00:30:57,700 --> 00:31:04,700
side public interest you can publish it

461
00:31:06,230 --> 00:31:11,310
you don't have to get like I put produce
mature my books you'd only copyright

462
00:31:11,310 --> 00:31:16,080
comments or public you can share it and
that goes back to the paper issue versus

463
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:19,610
electronic when you get your electronic
Aug

464
00:31:19,610 --> 00:31:22,810
posted on the internet and de France

465
00:31:22,810 --> 00:31:26,740
so it's it's very important that release
done elektronik

466
00:31:26,740 --> 00:31:32,950
I one more question I

467
00:31:32,950 --> 00:31:36,020
freedom one by one

468
00:31:36,020 --> 00:31:39,889
offer if their electronic you know you
press the fun

469
00:31:39,890 --> 00:31:45,940
there's no way to a program that I know
that no program to sort through

470
00:31:45,940 --> 00:31:50,720
now on the FBI website they say they
have I think I

471
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:54,770
someone may know that you can't on the
fall the way to search through the

472
00:31:54,770 --> 00:31:55,629
records by

473
00:31:55,630 --> 00:31:59,590
for you certain things but when you've
got a really easily guide

474
00:31:59,590 --> 00:32:03,090
do it so you just are really pretty
still

475
00:32:03,090 --> 00:32:06,380
pretty soon you get a sense what's
relevant to what your interest

476
00:32:06,380 --> 00:32:09,470
and watch this

477
00:32:09,470 --> 00:32:13,080
there's lot lately let me move

478
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:17,139
I filed a lawsuit in 2008 greenberg the
FBI

479
00:32:17,140 --> 00:32:21,920
to get the files onto FBI directors who
have died

480
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:25,360
reach L patrick gray the for

481
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:30,210
Clarence M Kelly they were both L
patrick gray

482
00:32:30,210 --> 00:32:33,300
players and tell they had served in the
seventies

483
00:32:33,300 --> 00:32:36,400
after hoover died they were the
successors

484
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:40,020
one serve racer for eleven months

485
00:32:40,020 --> 00:32:43,230
and Kelly took over in 73 answer

486
00:32:43,230 --> 00:32:46,350
278 than webster K or

487
00:32:46,350 --> 00:32:50,360
what's but the storwize the world
Saturday

488
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:55,380
now I knew J edgar Hoover's FBI files
about 17,000 pages

489
00:32:55,380 --> 00:32:59,480
so I so they they keep files on their
files related to the director

490
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:02,890
so after his file both their file

491
00:33:02,890 --> 00:33:09,140
for the books right they didn't respond
to my request

492
00:33:09,140 --> 00:33:13,560
two separate request they had a what's
called a new respond they

493
00:33:13,560 --> 00:33:17,300
morning I said it a second set of water

494
00:33:17,300 --> 00:33:20,350
and they're required by law to respond
within 20 days

495
00:33:20,350 --> 00:33:24,490
school 25th a second settlers

496
00:33:24,490 --> 00:33:28,190
the muted ago you response

497
00:33:28,190 --> 00:33:31,820
the in order what do you do that

498
00:33:31,820 --> 00:33:35,790
could sue that's grounds to sue I didn't

499
00:33:35,790 --> 00:33:38,909
sue then I just waited outside

500
00:33:38,910 --> 00:33:42,360
said okay wait this out several months
later

501
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:47,440
they acknowledge my request they sent me
a letter saying that the Kelly file was

502
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:49,290
fifty eight thousand pages

503
00:33:49,290 --> 00:33:53,370
and the great fire would be smaller but
they didn't know yet

504
00:33:53,370 --> 00:33:58,630
the side 58,000 something J edgar hoover
17,000

505
00:33:58,630 --> 00:34:02,420
sir 48 years Kelly 58,000

506
00:34:02,420 --> 00:34:07,040
surfrider sounds pretty good gotta be
allowed in there

507
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:10,168
I had asked in my letter first

508
00:34:10,168 --> 00:34:13,620
for to be released on CD rom not paper

509
00:34:13,620 --> 00:34:17,259
the prior year they started to really
think rar

510
00:34:17,260 --> 00:34:21,970
though sometimes it was on paper
sometime Romney was a standard process

511
00:34:21,970 --> 00:34:26,740
how they would release if it's on paper
they tried

512
00:34:26,740 --> 00:34:31,750
attention to pay labor how much

513
00:34:31,750 --> 00:34:36,418
six thousand dollars if they to CD-rom
its 15

514
00:34:36,418 --> 00:34:39,870
dollars per CD and there could be five

515
00:34:39,870 --> 00:34:42,918
minimal for about five hundred pages per
CD

516
00:34:42,918 --> 00:34:46,520
is how they would process be a lot
cheaper

517
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:51,389
several hundred dollars versus six
thousand so I call them on the fall

518
00:34:51,389 --> 00:34:55,379
you're allowed to do and I said why
don't

519
00:34:55,380 --> 00:35:00,060
I had asked for electronic why why did
you let you say papered

520
00:35:00,060 --> 00:35:03,360
six thousand dollars and we had a
discussion

521
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:07,660
let me get back to you and they got back
to me they said okay we'll put it on CD

522
00:35:07,660 --> 00:35:07,960
rom

523
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:11,840
because we want to put it in our library
anyway

524
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:15,360
FBI headquarters is a very important
files directors

525
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:18,750
they're going to be in the reading room
it at FBI headquarters

526
00:35:18,750 --> 00:35:23,810
so we want to be electronic then they
call me back

527
00:35:23,810 --> 00:35:28,759
a little bit later about a week or two
later they change their mind that its

528
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:35,170
the back to paper asked why they
wouldn't I miss it to put it in a letter

529
00:35:35,170 --> 00:35:38,590
so they wrote it down to put it
memorialized

530
00:35:38,590 --> 00:35:41,640
that point

531
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:45,029
I thought okay I do love the basis for a
loss

532
00:35:45,030 --> 00:35:48,550
so I sport about it I asked a few people

533
00:35:48,550 --> 00:35:52,540
about it the I got the name of marx et

534
00:35:52,540 --> 00:35:56,190
was a very prominent for attorney and
national security attorney

535
00:35:56,190 --> 00:36:01,190
PC and his his cooperating attorney
Bradley morse

536
00:36:01,190 --> 00:36:05,210
I contacted them I explained my
situation said can I sue

537
00:36:05,210 --> 00:36:09,730
on the question paper versus wrong

538
00:36:09,730 --> 00:36:13,560
and they said yes that's an interesting
cutting edge type case because they've

539
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:15,759
begun to do records are paper

540
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:20,480
and we need to get everything done on
CD-rom

541
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:23,870
it would really help people so they took
on the case

542
00:36:23,870 --> 00:36:29,170
it soon under the Freedom of Information
Act civil lawsuits filed a motion to

543
00:36:29,170 --> 00:36:32,750
and the main issue is paper versus
electronic though there were some side

544
00:36:32,750 --> 00:36:33,180
issues

545
00:36:33,180 --> 00:36:36,799
make sure that with those search and so
on

546
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:40,020
after that they tell us that the Kelly
file

547
00:36:40,020 --> 00:36:45,050
isn't fifty a thousand pages 9000

548
00:36:45,050 --> 00:36:48,210
and the great file a 6500

549
00:36:48,210 --> 00:36:52,170
so what was 58 all of a sudden became
not

550
00:36:52,170 --> 00:36:56,180
is no way to challenge that first you
can in the washer say

551
00:36:56,180 --> 00:36:59,310
make sure you do with those search a

552
00:36:59,310 --> 00:37:03,330
and the irony is I might not a suit was
only nine thousand pages a slight

553
00:37:03,330 --> 00:37:05,970
hundred dollars

554
00:37:05,970 --> 00:37:12,150
so I might have accepted on paper hats
scan it for me or something like that

555
00:37:12,150 --> 00:37:15,290
but I didn't know was nine thousand the
a

556
00:37:15,290 --> 00:37:18,550
but I'm glad I sued because if you see
when you win

557
00:37:18,550 --> 00:37:22,480
they pay attorneys fees everyone

558
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:25,500
so about swatch

559
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:30,330
I we did win the lawsuit there resort we
signed a joint status agreement with

560
00:37:30,330 --> 00:37:31,840
Department of Justice

561
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:36,370
they agreed to release electronically
minimum a hundred pages per month

562
00:37:36,370 --> 00:37:43,230
to all the files will release I still
have to pay fifteen dollars produce

563
00:37:43,230 --> 00:37:47,160
and there are about 500 pages produce

564
00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:50,220
and that took year and a half

565
00:37:50,220 --> 00:37:54,650
and then it was close there was no
opinion by Judge this

566
00:37:54,650 --> 00:37:59,220
they really gave it as soon as we should
they say okay

567
00:37:59,220 --> 00:38:02,250
but this was an important case I think
to

568
00:38:02,250 --> 00:38:07,380
how move forward towards electronic
records within the next year or so

569
00:38:07,380 --> 00:38:10,520
settled in 2000 hi it is

570
00:38:10,520 --> 00:38:13,800
everything was on electronic now if you
make a request

571
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:17,220
occasionally ascend paper justice

572
00:38:17,220 --> 00:38:20,860
lazy or for some weird reason put it on
fire

573
00:38:20,860 --> 00:38:24,630
on electronic if you ask for you have to
ask

574
00:38:24,630 --> 00:38:28,530
your letter for to be release electronic

575
00:38:28,530 --> 00:38:33,170
so that was a lawsuit I'll to related
issues in that

576
00:38:33,170 --> 00:38:39,130
Russian one is why did they limit
purchased five hundred-page

577
00:38:39,130 --> 00:38:42,710
I've gotten some files 2008 this

578
00:38:42,710 --> 00:38:46,630
certainly more than 500 this

579
00:38:46,630 --> 00:38:50,040
why limit it that way is that a delay
strategies

580
00:38:50,040 --> 00:38:54,570
to make it cost more and their current
policy

581
00:38:54,570 --> 00:38:58,840
I don't know if anyone here knows to
maybe even changes but his

582
00:38:58,840 --> 00:39:02,810
approximately 500 pages for fifteen
dollars per day

583
00:39:02,810 --> 00:39:06,330
but like I said I requested the new left
file

584
00:39:06,330 --> 00:39:11,319
on the new from the nineteen sixties and
I gotta 2000 pages of

585
00:39:11,320 --> 00:39:14,940
with technically possible

586
00:39:14,940 --> 00:39:21,940
a yeah

587
00:40:19,210 --> 00:40:23,920
but there are preprocessed files already
more than 500 anyway

588
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:28,569
this general michael Magnitsky is
central to government addict dot com the

589
00:40:28,569 --> 00:40:31,460
website with a post lots of FBI files
and

590
00:40:31,460 --> 00:40:36,809
other government files and he's been
asking for files

591
00:40:36,809 --> 00:40:40,910
two decades another development I'm
learning

592
00:40:40,910 --> 00:40:45,170
arm hearing about is that sometimes
they're releasing files now on PDF by

593
00:40:45,170 --> 00:40:45,940
email

594
00:40:45,940 --> 00:40:50,839
so that really does expedite the process
but not FBI

595
00:40:50,839 --> 00:40:54,880
FBI hasn't done that yet some of the
other agencies government if you make a

596
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:55,609
request

597
00:40:55,609 --> 00:40:59,160
me to make a request for any agency of
the federal government not the congress

598
00:40:59,160 --> 00:41:03,078
for else

599
00:41:03,079 --> 00:41:07,599
weather except most executive branch
their of it I our asses big

600
00:41:07,599 --> 00:41:11,010
Veterans Affairs those are the two
biggest agency

601
00:41:11,010 --> 00:41:16,230
to get requests will send it to you by
email sometimes which makes

602
00:41:16,230 --> 00:41:19,440
electronically a PDF I

603
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:22,740
since the Act was passed or

604
00:41:22,740 --> 00:41:27,170
in 75 how many they've been about three
hundred thousand requests to the FBI

605
00:41:27,170 --> 00:41:32,329
300,000 now

606
00:41:32,329 --> 00:41:35,490
veterans an IRS get over a million

607
00:41:35,490 --> 00:41:38,539
several so FBI is

608
00:41:38,539 --> 00:41:42,750
doesn't get that as many as repressors
others and if you look at some other

609
00:41:42,750 --> 00:41:44,150
trends in that

610
00:41:44,150 --> 00:41:48,960
the peak was in the year two thousand

611
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:52,130
they got almost 24,000 request

612
00:41:52,130 --> 00:41:55,930
FBI record compared to

613
00:41:55,930 --> 00:41:59,339
15,000 in 1998

614
00:41:59,339 --> 00:42:02,670
so it vastly increased by the year two
thousand

615
00:42:02,670 --> 00:42:05,869
that's about when I'd why at that point

616
00:42:05,869 --> 00:42:12,029
I speculation but say lot a shake-up

617
00:42:12,029 --> 00:42:15,180
the line even the y2k everyone

618
00:42:15,180 --> 00:42:19,049
nervous in society and looking for ways
to hold government accountable

619
00:42:19,049 --> 00:42:22,099
I view for use as bottom-up power

620
00:42:22,099 --> 00:42:26,460
people power holding government account
getting government files is a political

621
00:42:26,460 --> 00:42:28,009
act when its FBI

622
00:42:28,009 --> 00:42:31,079
and because you can distribute
Information Store

623
00:42:31,079 --> 00:42:34,170
debates and that was a type people power

624
00:42:34,170 --> 00:42:37,559
a that peaked in the year two thousand

625
00:42:37,559 --> 00:42:40,960
2001 21,000 requests

626
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:47,960
then came bush and 9/11 what happened
upper down down dramatically

627
00:42:48,950 --> 00:42:52,180
2003 only eleven thousand requests

628
00:42:52,180 --> 00:42:56,410
more than fifty percent drop 2004

629
00:42:56,410 --> 00:43:01,180
ten-point 10 a 11,000 again 2000

630
00:43:01,180 --> 00:43:04,710
and five about 11,000 why would a p

631
00:43:04,710 --> 00:43:09,059
2000 people challenging government
challenging authority from below

632
00:43:09,059 --> 00:43:12,259
and then decline under Bush for Terra

633
00:43:12,259 --> 00:43:16,440
crackdown on dissent conformity in
society

634
00:43:16,440 --> 00:43:22,430
people ready to challenge authority then
Obama selected

635
00:43:22,430 --> 00:43:25,720
1 2008 election year

636
00:43:25,720 --> 00:43:29,250
John's 272 17,000 requests

637
00:43:29,250 --> 00:43:32,740
so Obama had promised in the campaign
open this

638
00:43:32,740 --> 00:43:36,980
and he was going to be the openness in
government present put out a famous

639
00:43:36,980 --> 00:43:39,319
press release a new era of openness

640
00:43:39,319 --> 00:43:42,329
in government and people in the 40

641
00:43:42,329 --> 00:43:47,569
community we're very pleased something
different and

642
00:43:47,569 --> 00:43:50,779
haven't really been on request

643
00:43:50,779 --> 00:43:57,779
jobs the next year 2009 15,000 2010
15,000 2011

644
00:43:59,039 --> 00:44:06,039
eleventh-hour that's the latest 11004
request FBI why did it go down

645
00:44:07,799 --> 00:44:11,589
some well

646
00:44:11,589 --> 00:44:15,430
maybe people or losing confidence is

647
00:44:15,430 --> 00:44:20,129
or maybe the conformity of the bush-era
starting to return more people or

648
00:44:20,130 --> 00:44:25,990
less confident challenging power or that
successful in getting results

649
00:44:25,990 --> 00:44:29,940
any well speculate on why you think it's
going down

650
00:44:29,940 --> 00:44:33,710
Obama first goes up hope people

651
00:44:33,710 --> 00:44:38,410
alive and hopes the card last couple
years

652
00:44:38,410 --> 00:44:45,410
a yes

653
00:44:58,610 --> 00:45:02,540
when you make a request you can get a
response anywhere from three months to

654
00:45:02,540 --> 00:45:09,540
two years that doctor

655
00:45:11,060 --> 00:45:15,310
most most requests are within a year you
can get you to make a request to get a

656
00:45:15,310 --> 00:45:18,509
two months later you can make a request
to get it two years later

657
00:45:18,510 --> 00:45:23,160
most to them or within a year yes I'm
talking about the FBI's

658
00:45:23,160 --> 00:45:26,890
and if it's been already process that
speeds it up

659
00:45:26,890 --> 00:45:30,720
will say this is already process
defender but sometimes

660
00:45:30,720 --> 00:45:33,730
to look nor likewise ignore you require

661
00:45:33,730 --> 00:45:37,130
say no records when they really are
board

662
00:45:37,130 --> 00:45:42,650
a let me go but let me should have some
questions I had in my description

663
00:45:42,650 --> 00:45:46,760
is why we should undermine the culture
in security

664
00:45:46,760 --> 00:45:50,240
first I would make the statement that
information is power

665
00:45:50,240 --> 00:45:56,580
a star my statement that's thats the
commonly known statement and information

666
00:45:56,580 --> 00:45:58,619
new information leads to new debates

667
00:45:58,619 --> 00:46:01,710
new social movements colorized moore's
can be written

668
00:46:01,710 --> 00:46:05,780
what security

669
00:46:05,780 --> 00:46:12,310
and whose security is really at stake
white its government tried to spread a

670
00:46:12,310 --> 00:46:13,859
cultural in security

671
00:46:13,859 --> 00:46:17,819
no I would suggest two ways of looking
at it is

672
00:46:17,820 --> 00:46:23,440
is in security is to control population
to create

673
00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:27,050
your anxiety in the society to limit the
set

674
00:46:27,050 --> 00:46:30,250
to limit what's considered acceptable
discourse

675
00:46:30,250 --> 00:46:35,820
overexpression in a few protest now
outside at Occupy Wall Street are you

676
00:46:35,820 --> 00:46:37,109
choose to being a terrorist

677
00:46:37,109 --> 00:46:41,650
if you protest at the Democratic or
Republican convention are you a

678
00:46:41,650 --> 00:46:42,410
terrorist

679
00:46:42,410 --> 00:46:47,649
if you're an anti-globalization
protesters are you a terrorist if you're

680
00:46:47,650 --> 00:46:48,720
an environmental

681
00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:53,600
if your week leaker he was accused of
being a terrace

682
00:46:53,600 --> 00:46:56,680
by I think Joe Biden said terrace

683
00:46:56,680 --> 00:47:00,500
so that your partner

684
00:47:00,500 --> 00:47:05,220
in security right spreading your ideas
that people terrorists so much fear and

685
00:47:05,220 --> 00:47:05,980
anxiety

686
00:47:05,980 --> 00:47:10,060
threat to society now to some degree
it's for protection

687
00:47:10,060 --> 00:47:13,670
that's the official rights for
protection and security

688
00:47:13,670 --> 00:47:18,450
was not in securities really security
protect the public against terrorist

689
00:47:18,450 --> 00:47:18,930
attack

690
00:47:18,930 --> 00:47:25,930
how many terrorist attacks ever been
since I love about four that have been

691
00:47:25,950 --> 00:47:26,720
documented

692
00:47:26,720 --> 00:47:31,130
all small scale that have succeeded only
anyone yet probably match

693
00:47:31,130 --> 00:47:34,270
successful very small lone wolf

694
00:47:34,270 --> 00:47:37,550
and then box for oiled attacks

695
00:47:37,550 --> 00:47:41,380
some legitimate but many of the 4 I'll
the tax

696
00:47:41,380 --> 00:47:46,100
were wonderful aging product or attacks
with the FBI hatched plans

697
00:47:46,100 --> 00:47:49,760
and enticed people to make plans to
break the law

698
00:47:49,760 --> 00:47:54,200
more than 40 people have been arrested
in these provocative or attacks since

699
00:47:54,200 --> 00:47:55,180
9/11

700
00:47:55,180 --> 00:48:00,460
I am david shipler was written a book on
civil liberties

701
00:48:00,460 --> 00:48:03,780
at our article in the New York Times
very recently

702
00:48:03,780 --> 00:48:07,609
April 28th 2012

703
00:48:07,609 --> 00:48:11,180
fall terrorist plots hatched by the FBI

704
00:48:11,180 --> 00:48:17,460
so know it yet I tend to take a somewhat
critical position on this but some

705
00:48:17,460 --> 00:48:18,300
people think

706
00:48:18,300 --> 00:48:21,740
to root out the terrorist you have to
entice him and see who's

707
00:48:21,740 --> 00:48:27,980
who's likely to commit an act and there
is evidence in the allotted

708
00:48:27,980 --> 00:48:31,109
cases are people making plans

709
00:48:31,109 --> 00:48:35,430
but usually they are arrested way before
the occurrence before they materials

710
00:48:35,430 --> 00:48:39,819
and defense lawyers say it's a trap in
there are a lot of convictions

711
00:48:39,820 --> 00:48:44,369
DAX

712
00:48:44,369 --> 00:48:49,290
point on this if you start calling
everyone a terrorist doesn't lose its

713
00:48:49,290 --> 00:48:52,590
me speak or

714
00:48:52,590 --> 00:48:55,660
vegetarian without

715
00:48:55,660 --> 00:48:58,660
up in in Syria today

716
00:48:58,660 --> 00:49:02,259
they call the opposition terrace in

717
00:49:02,260 --> 00:49:05,590
Egypt before the revolution there said
everyone was a terrorist

718
00:49:05,590 --> 00:49:09,190
in cuba castro abortion rights workers
terrace

719
00:49:09,190 --> 00:49:14,270
in China they call the Dalai Lama a
terrorist and Tibetan monks have set

720
00:49:14,270 --> 00:49:16,080
themselves on fire in protest

721
00:49:16,080 --> 00:49:19,710
terrace so the US has sorted the base
that

722
00:49:19,710 --> 00:49:23,510
term in my view and its occurring all
around the world by

723
00:49:23,510 --> 00:49:28,710
authoritarian regimes calling protesters
terror now there are some legitimate

724
00:49:28,710 --> 00:49:30,530
iris arcade some more

725
00:49:30,530 --> 00:49:33,640
but again the word has been so debased

726
00:49:33,640 --> 00:49:38,359
and you so frequently for protesting
that I would say

727
00:49:38,359 --> 00:49:41,900
for this culture been secured I

728
00:49:41,900 --> 00:49:45,240
can we control the deployment of
surveillance systems

729
00:49:45,240 --> 00:49:49,560
the people I would say yes

730
00:49:49,560 --> 00:49:53,509
someone example a close circuit
television

731
00:49:53,510 --> 00:49:56,970
in Manhattan they established the ring
of steel

732
00:49:56,970 --> 00:50:00,990
in the last two years lower Manhattan 3

733
00:50:00,990 --> 00:50:04,250
thousand cameras and I think someone
talked on this

734
00:50:04,250 --> 00:50:08,560
on Friday 3,000 CCTV cameras in lower
Manhattan

735
00:50:08,560 --> 00:50:14,869
subways they already have it in London

736
00:50:14,869 --> 00:50:19,910
its it's a ring of steel against while
against terrorist attack

737
00:50:19,910 --> 00:50:24,899
I would say wants to live in the ring
steel

738
00:50:24,900 --> 00:50:29,420
well-earned in the city and I don't
currently

739
00:50:29,420 --> 00:50:33,210
I did for me a

740
00:50:33,210 --> 00:50:37,050
was there any public debate about
establishing the Rings

741
00:50:37,050 --> 00:50:42,680
was in May or poster supported what
about the City Council

742
00:50:42,680 --> 00:50:48,180
everyone supported I mean maybe a few
City Council members raise questions but

743
00:50:48,180 --> 00:50:50,250
everyone there was a big advocate is

744
00:50:50,250 --> 00:50:53,740
is Chief of Police a big advocate so
it's possible

745
00:50:53,740 --> 00:50:56,950
to oppose it if the political leaders
oppose

746
00:50:56,950 --> 00:51:00,220
not that surveillance is impose

747
00:51:00,220 --> 00:51:04,150
without any debate or resistance or can
be

748
00:51:04,150 --> 00:51:07,290
if the leaders in power are willing to
do it

749
00:51:07,290 --> 00:51:11,490
now how do you get leaders in power to
impose valances

750
00:51:11,490 --> 00:51:16,280
if people protests that if there's a
social movement to build against

751
00:51:16,280 --> 00:51:22,119
and I would know when the USA PATRIOT
Act was passed through after 9/11

752
00:51:22,119 --> 00:51:25,650
which enhanced surveillance very few
those very there was no congressional

753
00:51:25,650 --> 00:51:27,520
debate

754
00:51:27,520 --> 00:51:32,240
and there have been protests against
more than 400 cities and counties have

755
00:51:32,240 --> 00:51:35,670
passed resolutions against the pager

756
00:51:35,670 --> 00:51:40,060
the Bill of Rights Defense Committee
document

757
00:51:40,060 --> 00:51:43,440
thought possible but it was signed by
Obama

758
00:51:43,440 --> 00:51:47,810
and so the prospects for surveillance

759
00:51:47,810 --> 00:51:50,970
I'll maybe write another book about

760
00:51:50,970 --> 00:51:54,730
what's gonna happen in the future
occurring every few for your requests

761
00:51:54,730 --> 00:51:56,320
outstanding

762
00:51:56,320 --> 00:52:01,430
I just got one on the book review file
this five thousand pages FBI reviewing

763
00:52:01,430 --> 00:52:02,180
books

764
00:52:02,180 --> 00:52:06,050
that they consider relevant to the FBI
International Security

765
00:52:06,050 --> 00:52:10,270
will have a reviewer reviewing a book
and putting it in their files

766
00:52:10,270 --> 00:52:16,770
and they note although derogatory
references to the FBI

767
00:52:16,770 --> 00:52:22,050
there are in any way any last questions
I think we're almost at a time

768
00:52:22,050 --> 00:52:29,050
I five minutes

769
00:52:30,540 --> 00:52:32,820
the time

770
00:52:32,820 --> 00:52:36,660
well the problem is if it's an ongoing
investigation they may not release

771
00:52:36,660 --> 00:52:41,109
they may excluded from the search say
they know records a

772
00:52:41,110 --> 00:52:45,450
or they may I responses to requests
anywhere from

773
00:52:45,450 --> 00:52:48,600
to from two months two years lasater

774
00:52:48,600 --> 00:52:51,960
really there's standard yeah

775
00:52:51,960 --> 00:52:58,960
the back

776
00:53:07,170 --> 00:53:10,440
in the law you mean laying sore

777
00:53:10,440 --> 00:53:16,729
strong language use well

778
00:53:16,729 --> 00:53:19,910
congress those and amendments 24 make

779
00:53:19,910 --> 00:53:23,288
stronger or weaker so yes it could be
straight then

780
00:53:23,289 --> 00:53:30,289
should be straight any other questions
yeah

781
00:53:32,350 --> 00:53:36,009
no record and I post i've a web site

782
00:53:36,010 --> 00:53:39,030
a I think remember

783
00:53:39,030 --> 00:53:43,550
block blocks by whatever whatever and
I've postal letter

784
00:53:43,550 --> 00:53:46,590
have no records now that could be

785
00:53:46,590 --> 00:53:49,890
sheer that could be the tax issue acted
because is ongoing

786
00:53:49,890 --> 00:53:52,950
maybe there really are no records you
know you know

787
00:53:52,950 --> 00:53:57,980
Fisher any other questions yeah I can't
see

788
00:53:57,980 --> 00:54:04,980
yes

789
00:54:17,490 --> 00:54:21,640
well I won't it will be repealed but
when reagan was in power he limited it

790
00:54:21,640 --> 00:54:28,640
be limited

791
00:54:30,830 --> 00:54:35,610
well

792
00:54:35,610 --> 00:54:38,880
ok Obama said he was an advocate of four

793
00:54:38,880 --> 00:54:43,600
and open it wrongly it hasn't entered
the debate jet that I'm aware of

794
00:54:43,600 --> 00:54:48,380
I haven't seen any comments him how he
views information flows

795
00:54:48,380 --> 00:54:51,950
and the field of Information Act I don't
think that would be an effort to repeal

796
00:54:51,950 --> 00:54:52,360
it

797
00:54:52,360 --> 00:54:56,700
but their efforts to restrict it and to
frame to give the president

798
00:54:56,700 --> 00:55:00,430
give waters before you officers to
interpret the more

799
00:55:00,430 --> 00:55:03,920
for earlier loosely and that affects
other

800
00:55:03,920 --> 00:55:09,140
respond any other questions via

801
00:55:09,140 --> 00:55:16,140
yes there

802
00:55:16,320 --> 00:55:23,320
okay yeah

803
00:55:25,510 --> 00:55:28,890
to their release yes

804
00:55:28,890 --> 00:55:35,890
generally there if it included they
would redact some their personnel review

805
00:55:37,670 --> 00:55:38,880
every page

806
00:55:38,880 --> 00:55:42,200
they block it out with the pan and put
it to a photo machine

807
00:55:42,200 --> 00:55:45,200
that then it shows without that's where
these

808
00:55:45,200 --> 00:55:50,309
do it yes they casually redact records
but they often make mistakes

809
00:55:50,309 --> 00:55:55,599
things through so on and so forth all
right thank you for

810
00:55:55,599 --> 00:55:57,270
for coming and if there are any
questions
