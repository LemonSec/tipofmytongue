1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:05,210
which and of community manager and an
attack he has a little bit about cent

2
00:00:05,210 --> 00:00:06,120
rise in the lab

3
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:09,760
I'm we'll look at some other earlier
examples

4
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:13,129
have as centralized and decentralized
and

5
00:00:13,130 --> 00:00:16,900
decentralized communications and see am

6
00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:23,900
what that sort of in first for wearing
my go forward and say this is not a very

7
00:00:24,050 --> 00:00:24,920
first

8
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:28,420
machine at 10 email %uh the big thing in
the back now the typewriter

9
00:00:28,420 --> 00:00:33,579
am although that may have been part of
it and this with us and my retirement in

10
00:00:33,579 --> 00:00:35,260
1971 ARPANET

11
00:00:35,260 --> 00:00:38,849
and I am he's responsible for their
ubiquitous apt symbol

12
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:42,690
and so a there was originally no need
for

13
00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:45,989
add the centralization because
everything was centralized in fact

14
00:00:45,989 --> 00:00:49,180
almost everybody that you wanted to talk
to is probably in the same building

15
00:00:49,180 --> 00:00:52,730
and it was only when they had more than
one machine at building that

16
00:00:52,730 --> 00:00:56,620
they had the person at some computer
format and so I am

17
00:00:56,620 --> 00:01:01,030
that's very being implemented on about
forty machines in 1972

18
00:01:01,030 --> 00:01:04,869
so the plan that is that and email
started its

19
00:01:04,869 --> 00:01:08,990
a all in one place so everyone use the
same format and

20
00:01:08,990 --> 00:01:12,789
by 1982 SMTP I according to Wikipedia

21
00:01:12,790 --> 00:01:17,090
became widely used and I think payment
pretty much everybody who had a computer

22
00:01:17,090 --> 00:01:18,080
was using it

23
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:22,119
so for that magical widely used am

24
00:01:22,119 --> 00:01:26,640
everything else has got to work on top
of it and so even know SMTP may not be a

25
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:27,509
perfect standard

26
00:01:27,509 --> 00:01:30,619
it is ubiquitous and it does work as a
distant rise thing

27
00:01:30,619 --> 00:01:35,250
like you can now hear gmail you can have
your and your main email you can have

28
00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:38,540
anything you want and it will still talk
to other email cell

29
00:01:38,540 --> 00:01:42,710
thats that sort of like the the Good
News said decentralized

30
00:01:42,710 --> 00:01:46,119
communications can happen so we can take
that as a good

31
00:01:46,119 --> 00:01:50,490
am thing they were in the right
direction a chat is another one so in

32
00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:51,420
1982

33
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:54,950
with the Commodore 64's did anyone have
those at their house

34
00:01:54,950 --> 00:01:58,479
American yeah to think they understand
that okay

35
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:01,740
am we got we got two games free with our
cell

36
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:06,700
that was kinda cool an but when people
got that day and

37
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:11,300
they also got had the opportunity to
sign up for quantum link which is you

38
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:13,170
can send a message for a fee

39
00:02:13,170 --> 00:02:16,440
Anna most people are just becoming
acquainted with the whole idea

40
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:19,849
home computers today you know they
weren't really asking like why

41
00:02:19,849 --> 00:02:24,030
York and I have a different format or is
is the only service you have it was like

42
00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:27,840
we can send messages for an extra fee
ass so

43
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:31,060
found that company later became lol and
I am

44
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:34,120
and then %uh took that us or give

45
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:35,319
and

46
00:02:35,319 --> 00:02:39,450
not sadness into the ER you can pay by
the minute for

47
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:42,450
connection to the Internet Sam am

48
00:02:42,450 --> 00:02:47,890
still anyway and people use to I am but
only on the mission you know only the

49
00:02:47,890 --> 00:02:50,130
people had the same service that they
did

50
00:02:50,130 --> 00:02:54,510
until a Jabber came to the rescue is add
XMPP

51
00:02:54,510 --> 00:02:59,630
protocol sale that means that all the
different I am clans can finally talk to

52
00:02:59,630 --> 00:03:00,230
each other

53
00:03:00,230 --> 00:03:05,349
am that Turk tell 2000 said took a while

54
00:03:05,349 --> 00:03:09,060
to get to have all the different chat
clients feel to talk to each other

55
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:13,510
and have everybody agree that that was a
good thing and finally give up the ghost

56
00:03:13,510 --> 00:03:17,670
of a dream that people organ all migrate
over to their one service and give up on

57
00:03:17,670 --> 00:03:18,769
all the other one so

58
00:03:18,769 --> 00:03:23,200
and 30s 48 folks to and believe that

59
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:27,700
a having a standard format verses like
waiting for everyone to finally give up

60
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:29,220
and come to your service

61
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:33,830
is what's gonna happen but with chat we
finally to do that Sam

62
00:03:33,830 --> 00:03:38,319
to good thing cell

63
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:41,840
monopolies serious business am

64
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:46,880
Pierre the telecom industry Soria

65
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:51,430
a it its remix machiavelli look like
he's just playing with toys

66
00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:55,000
when you take a look at what they've
done city this is

67
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:59,530
a Telecom is private companies that were
tasked with providing a public good

68
00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:02,820
and result is a lotta misplace cost

69
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:06,640
and rampant corruption cell I'll

70
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:10,579
one mob Ellis you know we had just one
phone company in this country

71
00:04:10,579 --> 00:04:13,850
I'll we had really expensive
long-distance

72
00:04:13,850 --> 00:04:17,260
and exhortation a giant government
handouts and then

73
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:20,510
we paper that the our taxes so we're
paying

74
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:23,770
tip for the privilege of having a really
expensive long distance

75
00:04:23,770 --> 00:04:27,099
and this is still kinda had telecom
operates their

76
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:31,360
definitely in at like if her business
model works for you then don't fix it

77
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:36,090
and so I'm horizon for examples reports
a loss on their state filings

78
00:04:36,090 --> 00:04:39,190
but they have outsource like a lotta
their expenses

79
00:04:39,190 --> 00:04:43,800
to use subsidiary affiliates that also
Verizon and the names it's not like

80
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:45,570
they're really trying to be super
secretive

81
00:04:45,570 --> 00:04:48,580
am but then those affiliates

82
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:53,789
low-ball what they bill on for their
services and then report a loss sets

83
00:04:53,789 --> 00:04:54,390
like this

84
00:04:54,390 --> 00:04:57,550
complicated thing where they charge
themselves

85
00:04:57,550 --> 00:05:01,590
like too little to make money and then
report a loss

86
00:05:01,590 --> 00:05:04,789
because in charge themselves enough
money am

87
00:05:04,789 --> 00:05:09,710
still it its there said there's no video
I can send you a link for their few 10

88
00:05:09,710 --> 00:05:13,180
you know be disgusted with telecom up
more so

89
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:16,190
that is I have it to the user's a

90
00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:20,360
they use those lost numbers to lobby for
higher customer return and more tax

91
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:21,159
relief

92
00:05:21,159 --> 00:05:24,560
and its also how they operate with
broadband so you give

93
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:28,130
Lake a few large private companies money
to provide broadband

94
00:05:28,130 --> 00:05:32,099
and then polisher to live out how
difficult it is a comeback in the ass

95
00:05:32,099 --> 00:05:33,020
for more money

96
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:36,830
and then we give it to them cuz we
really want everyone to have brought the

97
00:05:36,830 --> 00:05:37,240
and

98
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:42,370
and be connected to the internet so
doesn't wanna promises in the 1996

99
00:05:42,370 --> 00:05:45,890
Telecommunications Act that we're gonna
like have internet for everyone

100
00:05:45,890 --> 00:05:51,430
and so on around like two thousand the
US ranked fifth in the world among the

101
00:05:51,430 --> 00:05:52,169
world's

102
00:05:52,169 --> 00:05:55,799
nations for broadband penetration and
then we dropped a lake

103
00:05:55,800 --> 00:06:01,630
22 on we sort of abandoned our
commitment to any kind of competition

104
00:06:01,630 --> 00:06:05,340
for broadband services and decided like
will just let these people were doing a

105
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:06,820
terrible job of writing

106
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:09,840
broadband with a lot of money will give
them

107
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:13,130
more money to continue to do a terrible
job %uh

108
00:06:13,130 --> 00:06:18,289
on that is to say that am a giant
subsidize monopoly

109
00:06:18,289 --> 00:06:21,960
to provide a public good ad doesn't
really work

110
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:25,229
cell in case you are unclear on that am

111
00:06:25,229 --> 00:06:30,240
and in case you're not exactly how much
money herds pally 340 billion dollars

112
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:33,370
that has been given out to connect

113
00:06:33,370 --> 00:06:37,840
everyone to the Internet I feel like
four a fraction and that I could go out

114
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:42,530
to Wyoming with like a truck full of cat
5 into the lake at least a little bit of

115
00:06:42,530 --> 00:06:43,510
a better job

116
00:06:43,510 --> 00:06:46,510
and prolly maybe I take a couple people
from this room

117
00:06:46,510 --> 00:06:53,510
Sam my knee a couple tracks and the
other thing that happens when you have

118
00:06:53,550 --> 00:06:56,810
a communication system that's been given
a government

119
00:06:56,810 --> 00:07:00,899
a government-sanctioned monopoly is
added a tent air

120
00:07:00,899 --> 00:07:05,149
take on the idea that they should
control what kind of communication you

121
00:07:05,149 --> 00:07:06,120
have

122
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:09,580
Selanne this is a

123
00:07:09,580 --> 00:07:12,950
this you love the New York vice
department and so

124
00:07:12,950 --> 00:07:18,719
and 1873 a the US government decided
that the kinds of things you should mail

125
00:07:18,719 --> 00:07:21,890
should be controlled we gave the US
Postal Service

126
00:07:21,890 --> 00:07:25,599
am you know %uh a sanction monopoly to
do

127
00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:29,550
third letter delivery and and mail
delivery to each person's home

128
00:07:29,550 --> 00:07:33,120
but we didn't want them to be delivering
anything that was seen

129
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:37,520
R&D send and missus like treaty
prohibition so it meant

130
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:41,959
nothing that promoted alcohol
consumption we also couldn't talk about

131
00:07:41,959 --> 00:07:45,020
abortion or contraception not sex Lake

132
00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:48,630
that was like already assumed to be like
way off the table

133
00:07:48,630 --> 00:07:52,050
but Lake contraception or you know
abortion

134
00:07:52,050 --> 00:07:56,339
like even a discussion a bit and so now
won anything that happens when you can

135
00:07:56,339 --> 00:07:58,789
the discussion is that it seems that

136
00:07:58,789 --> 00:08:02,300
the a the other side has sort of her

137
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:07,360
moral majority then they do and you see
this a lot with my stuff like so

138
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:12,940
on with a like the National Organization
for the Reformation a marijuana laws

139
00:08:12,940 --> 00:08:13,560
like

140
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:17,370
you look at how many people are willing
to say like to smoke pot

141
00:08:17,370 --> 00:08:20,680
and then you're like I don't really want
people to know that but I think that it

142
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:22,399
should be OK and then

143
00:08:22,399 --> 00:08:25,729
as soon as someone stands up and says
like I think we should legalize it

144
00:08:25,729 --> 00:08:27,969
everyone's like that guy smokes pot

145
00:08:27,969 --> 00:08:31,729
and so that kinda thing that happens
when you make it

146
00:08:31,729 --> 00:08:35,309
illegal to talk about her sorry shame
that discussion

147
00:08:35,310 --> 00:08:39,120
is that you know you'd say like I think
he'd be okay a bike

148
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:43,289
you know everyone should be lighter me
around like weird hardcore pornography

149
00:08:43,289 --> 00:08:46,860
maybe with the animals and the neurons
like your fuckin ago

150
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:52,420
so its it so you can even just feel like
now now now I just support

151
00:08:52,420 --> 00:08:55,439
pair right take pictures side state

152
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:58,970
them have the distinction is totally
lost so it really

153
00:08:58,970 --> 00:09:02,089
it changes the discussion and finally

154
00:09:02,089 --> 00:09:05,380
until the concept loving 1873

155
00:09:05,380 --> 00:09:08,950
it s a hundred years before anything

156
00:09:08,950 --> 00:09:12,029
changed this now then

157
00:09:12,029 --> 00:09:15,490
a course like what people are actually
doing was sending things in brown paper

158
00:09:15,490 --> 00:09:17,149
wrappers and there is a

159
00:09:17,149 --> 00:09:21,250
implicit agreement that you didn't peep
under other people's brown paper

160
00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:22,100
wrappers her

161
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:26,779
whatever am which is great until you get
the address wrong and then someone who

162
00:09:26,779 --> 00:09:29,519
really wasn't expecting to get porn

163
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:32,750
and get support in the mail and that's
what happened with Miller versus

164
00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:34,190
california sale

165
00:09:34,190 --> 00:09:37,560
and the and ended up a

166
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:40,310
deciding that it was okay

167
00:09:40,310 --> 00:09:43,440
for people to male porn as long as it

168
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:47,649
button met some kinda human community
standards

169
00:09:47,649 --> 00:09:52,740
and didn't depicts sexual conduct in a
patently offensive way which is

170
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:56,730
I guess defense is in the eye of the
beholder there and then that the work as

171
00:09:56,730 --> 00:09:57,529
a whole

172
00:09:57,529 --> 00:10:02,680
%uh lacks serious literary see artistic
political or scientific value so has

173
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:04,279
some value besides the

174
00:10:04,279 --> 00:10:07,899
you know to obvious value I'm

175
00:10:07,899 --> 00:10:12,950
tell I'm bell in 1973 finally in 1983

176
00:10:12,950 --> 00:10:17,459
as someone who had sent an advertisement
for

177
00:10:17,459 --> 00:10:21,620
as some condoms in the mail and someone
got it was like not the kinda magazine

178
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:23,380
easily get am

179
00:10:23,380 --> 00:10:27,459
come clean and then and the court
finally says the government cannot

180
00:10:27,459 --> 00:10:31,399
reduce the adult population to reading
what is only fit for children

181
00:10:31,399 --> 00:10:35,990
am finally they've helped pave the way
for a lot a penis enlargements fan as

182
00:10:35,990 --> 00:10:36,769
well but

183
00:10:36,769 --> 00:10:41,390
free speech comes with some speech that
you might not want sell and that's

184
00:10:41,390 --> 00:10:42,670
that's sorta what happens

185
00:10:42,670 --> 00:10:46,719
still no

186
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:50,360
looking at more modern communications
platforms other than

187
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:53,860
magazines and and mailing telephones an

188
00:10:53,860 --> 00:10:56,930
this this is what came

189
00:10:56,930 --> 00:11:01,760
outta the 1996 Telecommunications Act so
far as a television and

190
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:05,279
numbers are almost the same for radio
this is a couple years

191
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:10,040
after I think it's actually like 2007 so
they had them

192
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:13,930
like about ten years for the
telecommunications like no holds barred

193
00:11:13,930 --> 00:11:16,579
go ahead and consolidate all the various
media outlets

194
00:11:16,579 --> 00:11:21,010
sorry thing and what happens is that cut
consolidation is bad

195
00:11:21,010 --> 00:11:24,240
it leads to lower representation of
women and minorities

196
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:28,199
and because the competition is too stiff
still active

197
00:11:28,199 --> 00:11:32,079
the station former station owners had
been

198
00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:35,620
folks who had just one station and they
just couldn't compete with the massive

199
00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:36,329
conglomerate

200
00:11:36,329 --> 00:11:40,970
there was on has have have in life
thirty or forty or fifty stations

201
00:11:40,970 --> 00:11:44,930
so bad they couldn't get the advertising
revenue know they couldn't get the

202
00:11:44,930 --> 00:11:48,750
syndicated programs all these kinda
things and so they got squeezed out

203
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:53,970
so contamination media means that the
richest and most powerful and a

204
00:11:53,970 --> 00:11:55,610
controlling what's left over

205
00:11:55,610 --> 00:11:59,420
so it's bad an this

206
00:11:59,420 --> 00:12:03,689
her these were put together by
organization called free press and their

207
00:12:03,690 --> 00:12:08,699
te central tenet is it a line form
citizenry produces a healthier democracy

208
00:12:08,699 --> 00:12:09,190
and I

209
00:12:09,190 --> 00:12:13,180
I have a new agree and I think that it's
not only true for television and radio I

210
00:12:13,180 --> 00:12:14,490
think it's also true for

211
00:12:14,490 --> 00:12:18,740
for Internet and people get aladdin is
on the Internet

212
00:12:18,740 --> 00:12:23,000
so am there's numbers on that too from
pure if people wanna look it up

213
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:28,899
anyway so I think I think that this is
this is pretty telling this isn't

214
00:12:28,899 --> 00:12:29,980
reflected the

215
00:12:29,980 --> 00:12:35,370
population very well sow am you that you
end up with some problems about like

216
00:12:35,370 --> 00:12:37,079
what kinda stories get covered

217
00:12:37,079 --> 00:12:40,360
and that sort of thing as well which
there's been a little bit more about

218
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:41,430
recently to you

219
00:12:41,430 --> 00:12:45,660
and sell what if we sell

220
00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:49,000
problem where we have internet access
I'll

221
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:52,779
most I have problems only $9.99 will
start some

222
00:12:52,779 --> 00:12:55,910
am wanna a big one is privacy

223
00:12:55,910 --> 00:13:00,250
only have problems with privacy with a
where consolidated media so

224
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:03,940
the one-size-fits-all kinda thing when
and most people just don't care about

225
00:13:03,940 --> 00:13:05,699
privacy like Facebook

226
00:13:05,699 --> 00:13:10,899
or a.m. you know there was a exercise
keeping after the defile was that it is

227
00:13:10,899 --> 00:13:13,270
published all your exercise stash the
weapon

228
00:13:13,270 --> 00:13:17,180
people didn't know that their exercise
stats for getting published to the web

229
00:13:17,180 --> 00:13:17,709
in

230
00:13:17,709 --> 00:13:21,810
and they were publishing intercourse as
her exercise

231
00:13:21,810 --> 00:13:26,110
which if you the person he said like two
hours a vigorous like

232
00:13:26,110 --> 00:13:30,279
okay but a person is at 10 minutes of
moderate they might not a wanted ad on

233
00:13:30,279 --> 00:13:30,939
the internet

234
00:13:30,940 --> 00:13:34,110
I don't know so I a hill

235
00:13:34,110 --> 00:13:38,569
had a feeling it it's like the path of
least resistance is the best choice the

236
00:13:38,569 --> 00:13:41,069
only choice the only one that everybody
else is on

237
00:13:41,069 --> 00:13:46,209
is a pretty bad seen an you note so
having one entity to serve specific

238
00:13:46,209 --> 00:13:49,730
function means that you have one kinda
privacy and it's the lowest common

239
00:13:49,730 --> 00:13:50,949
denominator type

240
00:13:50,949 --> 00:13:54,610
is it a week and ask for your password
again like five times in a week because

241
00:13:54,610 --> 00:13:55,520
you're just that

242
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:59,529
bad at passwords and another funny easy
win

243
00:13:59,529 --> 00:14:02,770
a central AZ Senate overt censorship

244
00:14:02,770 --> 00:14:06,520
an who's seen something censored on
social media you put it up for someone

245
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:07,970
clean it up and then it was gone

246
00:14:07,970 --> 00:14:11,380
would you say yancy you have

247
00:14:11,380 --> 00:14:16,170
I he said the chicken-and-egg question

248
00:14:16,170 --> 00:14:19,640
drag I'm

249
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:25,579
still ay ay ay no Lake anti-corporate
messages like I've definitely

250
00:14:25,579 --> 00:14:28,559
I didn't see the original message me
things from occupier they said like

251
00:14:28,559 --> 00:14:30,279
messages are taken down

252
00:14:30,279 --> 00:14:33,459
or on you know periodically someone well

253
00:14:33,459 --> 00:14:37,309
the lake this people look gay lake
that's dirty and you should take that

254
00:14:37,309 --> 00:14:38,410
picture down and

255
00:14:38,410 --> 00:14:41,939
which is you now that is the

256
00:14:41,939 --> 00:14:45,540
pretty ridiculous you could just not
work I am

257
00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:49,829
so you see over censorship but then ya
sis yes or two more saddle censorship

258
00:14:49,829 --> 00:14:50,290
which

259
00:14:50,290 --> 00:14:53,760
am means that you have add

260
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:58,170
you know just certain kinds of things
rising to the top Cilic increasingly on

261
00:14:58,170 --> 00:15:01,779
Google searches you have paid stuff
rising to the top

262
00:15:01,779 --> 00:15:05,270
and others had the social norms gets
have perpetuated on other services

263
00:15:05,270 --> 00:15:06,140
Soleil

264
00:15:06,140 --> 00:15:10,829
on you too I E C like a pretty toxic
comment cultures to the point where

265
00:15:10,829 --> 00:15:14,500
if you put up a video your children like
you should just turn comment of like you

266
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:15,779
can't have

267
00:15:15,779 --> 00:15:20,520
normal comments lay because it's like oh
yes and that's so nice that Lee

268
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:23,550
you know los al is playing the piano and
then there's like

269
00:15:23,550 --> 00:15:27,890
we're Lake E an uncanny in RP that but
like

270
00:15:27,890 --> 00:15:31,819
terrible weird you know turn off the
comments if you cannot post video

271
00:15:31,819 --> 00:15:35,010
with your children and they're gonna
wanna look at the comments on that you

272
00:15:35,010 --> 00:15:36,360
just can't do it

273
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:41,309
an and so that's the social norm right
now is that like if you post videos then

274
00:15:41,309 --> 00:15:42,130
you have to

275
00:15:42,130 --> 00:15:47,390
you know deal with the most anonymously
dirty minded Lake gross person on the

276
00:15:47,390 --> 00:15:48,110
Internet

277
00:15:48,110 --> 00:15:52,339
with like the first comment on us so on

278
00:15:52,339 --> 00:15:56,760
we ended we don't have to all host our
video on one play 60

279
00:15:56,760 --> 00:16:00,220
and we could allow people to have a

280
00:16:00,220 --> 00:16:03,870
you know facility the comments or arm
have it be

281
00:16:03,870 --> 00:16:07,420
wait until it's like you've looked at it
and stuff like that am

282
00:16:07,420 --> 00:16:11,689
or set up dirt like a group that is okay
for comments and then

283
00:16:11,689 --> 00:16:14,920
you know strangers can't comment and
still

284
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:19,529
the other thing a really great is
customized online identities seen on to

285
00:16:19,529 --> 00:16:23,709
be like the public person everywhere
like maybe you could be public hearings

286
00:16:23,709 --> 00:16:28,750
not public there in and negotiate your
specific relationship with each

287
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:32,540
online services each had two sharing
that you do or not sharing

288
00:16:32,540 --> 00:16:35,750
as the case may be and big and

289
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:39,350
centralized services also means that
stuff less responsive so there's like a

290
00:16:39,350 --> 00:16:40,079
lady you

291
00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:43,160
on her Twitter account was

292
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:44,040
and

293
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:47,600
it turned out that some company like
seven years into her tweeting

294
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:51,170
under that account handle on chose their

295
00:16:51,170 --> 00:16:54,930
company name to be her Twitter handle
and so they were like well

296
00:16:54,930 --> 00:16:59,660
what is called children silly he can you
guys add up this person is squatting on

297
00:16:59,660 --> 00:17:00,790
our business name in

298
00:17:00,790 --> 00:17:05,660
for couple days they did but it was only
because she is a huge pile of

299
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:08,770
hours that they had to give her handle
back an

300
00:17:08,770 --> 00:17:12,790
a silly enough for the really
unresponsive think there's an

301
00:17:12,790 --> 00:17:16,188
I I met someone who's cousins last name
is def

302
00:17:16,189 --> 00:17:21,589
Snuggie eighty H and so she can't use
her own name on facebook because they

303
00:17:21,589 --> 00:17:23,230
assume that she's putting someone

304
00:17:23,230 --> 00:17:28,970
fake got name on their and sushi instead
has a fake name for Facebook because

305
00:17:28,970 --> 00:17:30,950
they want later use your real name

306
00:17:30,950 --> 00:17:34,770
she has no idea who to call about that
are right about that so

307
00:17:34,770 --> 00:17:39,560
she's given up late alright an you know
I'll just have a fake name and then

308
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:42,520
she's kinda not very happy with their
experience on Facebook

309
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:47,120
and it also means that you know new
features come really slowly and

310
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:50,540
not because if user demand that because
I advertiser demand

311
00:17:50,540 --> 00:17:56,800
I can see facepack I'm here some
existing projects

312
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:59,820
a dizzy when you're using Danika her
status not

313
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:02,950
okay couple people awsome

314
00:18:02,950 --> 00:18:06,710
hurt at me Thomas not rolled out yet

315
00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:10,520
I would already know if you're on their
kids I work there but am hammered ass

316
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:11,970
resin and Astra

317
00:18:11,970 --> 00:18:16,780
yeah awesome have you tried to your
friends to come on board used a Taser

318
00:18:16,780 --> 00:18:20,040
had our comps great okay an

319
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:23,950
still you know so there's some stuff
there some but there are some things out

320
00:18:23,950 --> 00:18:24,990
there so far

321
00:18:24,990 --> 00:18:29,230
on buddy cloud is a federated social
network that uses

322
00:18:29,230 --> 00:18:33,830
XMPP but again it's kinda that Tyler
thing same as Lake

323
00:18:33,830 --> 00:18:37,570
Jaber is where it's like goes out to one
central things so

324
00:18:37,570 --> 00:18:42,080
you have like a and I want you like a
thing with little satellites instead of

325
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:43,649
a many to many relationship

326
00:18:43,650 --> 00:18:47,280
an and so you know thats

327
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:51,379
that could use some work it could end up
being apart overall service that would

328
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:54,440
be great so these are some other things
that have been built so far like a

329
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:55,380
school project

330
00:18:55,380 --> 00:18:59,020
arm which seems like yeah okay but the

331
00:18:59,020 --> 00:19:03,470
the part that's actually the good news
is a

332
00:19:03,470 --> 00:19:06,750
the tools that have already been dealt
so there would be

333
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:09,910
if we wanted to have like a
decentralized version have everything in

334
00:19:09,910 --> 00:19:14,600
and decentralized services other things
that we haven't even thought of yet I

335
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:18,900
you might think like wow that sounds
like a lot of work are the great news is

336
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:19,840
that mister

337
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:23,970
bit is Lake already written with a free
safire language

338
00:19:23,970 --> 00:19:28,640
we suffer tools our web development
libraries that are all free and

339
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:31,800
available for your use and so I'm

340
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:35,389
the reason that they haven't been
completely turned into Lake free

341
00:19:35,390 --> 00:19:38,870
services for everybody to use is that a
lot of them have a little bit like a

342
00:19:38,870 --> 00:19:39,960
secret sauce

343
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:43,460
kinda bit that's licensed proprietary
Lisa

344
00:19:43,460 --> 00:19:47,390
c-in2 can to build a couple little bits
and pieces and I'm gonna go over what's

345
00:19:47,390 --> 00:19:48,040
been built

346
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:52,100
and what I need to building an

347
00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:55,429
so serving across instances we had a
pretty well covered

348
00:19:55,429 --> 00:19:59,560
there's like a the underlying bit where
there's databases we even million

349
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:01,560
databases and then we have a million
things

350
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:05,840
and so some other stuff is older like
XMPP like that

351
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:08,928
push style thing where an your

352
00:20:08,929 --> 00:20:12,740
always are pushing out but am I'm sorry

353
00:20:12,740 --> 00:20:16,929
a yet that is a push and then RSS which
is a pool

354
00:20:16,929 --> 00:20:20,560
and then a pubs have herb which is

355
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:23,919
apush an which means instead a

356
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:26,990
having to do with a lotta traffic coming
in like you have anything new you have

357
00:20:26,990 --> 00:20:28,530
anything new you have anything new

358
00:20:28,530 --> 00:20:32,540
which could be sorta owner s with a
small server

359
00:20:32,540 --> 00:20:36,080
like if you're running your own small
federated instant instead you have a

360
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:36,949
push really

361
00:20:36,950 --> 00:20:39,950
okay to sign up and then when I have
something I'll send it out to you

362
00:20:39,950 --> 00:20:43,610
which but changes the way this army
across instances

363
00:20:43,610 --> 00:20:48,550
has been done before Anna and there's
pretty robust like international

364
00:20:48,550 --> 00:20:50,389
community around have some have

365
00:20:50,390 --> 00:20:53,510
so that one's good as CNN is

366
00:20:53,510 --> 00:20:57,980
and that's what the seminar for as for
private conversations across instances

367
00:20:57,980 --> 00:20:59,500
so like if you have a leak

368
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:02,720
you like on facebook you have like the
private message as opposed to just

369
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:04,400
reading a loss a salmon

370
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:08,270
texture that on to centralize stuff am

371
00:21:08,270 --> 00:21:12,650
let's see cell yea

372
00:21:12,650 --> 00:21:17,140
serving in past instances an

373
00:21:17,140 --> 00:21:20,280
Kennedy management little a ton of tools
for this

374
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:23,379
and need is probably already know about
some maybe some

375
00:21:23,380 --> 00:21:26,760
that I have listed maybe some that I do
but am

376
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:30,750
Open ID which is a single sign-on see
you can sign onto a bunch of different

377
00:21:30,750 --> 00:21:35,460
a connected instances that are T-bill
browser ideas are T-bill

378
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:41,070
web finger on is it lets you point at a
site get information see you can see if

379
00:21:41,070 --> 00:21:42,580
you wanna talk to it

380
00:21:42,580 --> 00:21:45,918
a a lot is and a little bit more of a

381
00:21:45,919 --> 00:21:49,390
a more hack reversion have Open ID and
others

382
00:21:49,390 --> 00:21:52,980
a question VG that's not the most
user-friendly how do people actually is

383
00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:54,380
GPG

384
00:21:54,380 --> 00:21:58,830
and now do have you tried to get friends
to use GPG

385
00:21:58,830 --> 00:22:02,350
yeah yeah hadaka did they lose their
password

386
00:22:02,350 --> 00:22:05,820
in the first air the first week right
okay

387
00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:10,370
anyway so at the DRS Minister Stephen
magic signatures that has in Christian

388
00:22:10,370 --> 00:22:11,340
built and

389
00:22:11,340 --> 00:22:15,500
and then and some folks have been using
SSL as part of a on

390
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:19,270
a webservice a thing so that's the same
thing years for

391
00:22:19,270 --> 00:22:22,780
and secure browsing IRC Sam

392
00:22:22,780 --> 00:22:26,149
so those are the things that are built
another huge that's a lotta stuff

393
00:22:26,150 --> 00:22:30,250
a similar things it needs some work this
is where I can hope that you guys we

394
00:22:30,250 --> 00:22:30,630
like

395
00:22:30,630 --> 00:22:34,169
I always wanted to work on that I didn't
know anyone wanted me to.

396
00:22:34,169 --> 00:22:38,770
so on this is exciting

397
00:22:38,770 --> 00:22:42,679
alright cell decentralized search
there's a real each new york version it

398
00:22:42,679 --> 00:22:46,030
is to try a search but there isn't
anything that kinda localizer really

399
00:22:46,030 --> 00:22:47,030
good for

400
00:22:47,030 --> 00:22:50,800
on decentralize services yet still wanna
things that

401
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:54,700
when you have everything on one server
in one place

402
00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:58,220
you to search that one place and then
you can find lay well

403
00:22:58,220 --> 00:23:01,710
is my old boss on here cuz I wanna
blockers she drives me nuts

404
00:23:01,710 --> 00:23:04,890
you know or whatever Lake or you want in
LA

405
00:23:04,890 --> 00:23:08,860
where can I get more pictures approvals
and you can just search and get them

406
00:23:08,860 --> 00:23:13,070
and its it's all Greek it all in one
place in a way that the search works

407
00:23:13,070 --> 00:23:13,750
works the same

408
00:23:13,750 --> 00:23:17,470
each and every single instance cell that
doesn't

409
00:23:17,470 --> 00:23:21,130
work so well yet onto centralized
services so that need some

410
00:23:21,130 --> 00:23:25,110
that need some help that's a thing and
groups in tax people have a lot of

411
00:23:25,110 --> 00:23:27,990
groups and tags currently on centralized
services

412
00:23:27,990 --> 00:23:31,850
an thats almost moreover you I think but

413
00:23:31,850 --> 00:23:35,490
its it will you as important and

414
00:23:35,490 --> 00:23:38,919
people people need those kinda things to
the order

415
00:23:38,919 --> 00:23:42,290
you know first to get them over the hump
like come over to the weird stuff even

416
00:23:42,290 --> 00:23:43,310
heard of yet

417
00:23:43,310 --> 00:23:46,668
so are out so that's important and

418
00:23:46,669 --> 00:23:50,200
kinda going with that the categorization
and their relationships

419
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:54,710
the big one is this panhandling now and
so if you hate spam

420
00:23:54,710 --> 00:23:59,540
around his family yes okay great if you
hate spam and you think you might have

421
00:23:59,540 --> 00:24:01,159
this go to work on that

422
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:05,150
that's a huge problem a decentralized
services so wanted a great things

423
00:24:05,150 --> 00:24:08,580
about a centralized services that you
can do traffic analysis and figure out

424
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:10,659
like what looks like spam and what
doesn't

425
00:24:10,660 --> 00:24:14,450
these you a massive pileup data and then
you just to play

426
00:24:14,450 --> 00:24:17,580
like one Lake this stuff as spam

427
00:24:17,580 --> 00:24:21,820
to one place and that proliferate out
all your servers and you're good

428
00:24:21,820 --> 00:24:26,710
we have to centralized servers everyone
is doing essentially their own spam

429
00:24:26,710 --> 00:24:29,790
gatekeeping which is NOT AT ALL his n

430
00:24:29,790 --> 00:24:33,300
still exceeded over the hump in your
life okay I will host my own instance

431
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:36,560
cuz I'm told that I'm supposed to do and
that's the good thing to do and

432
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:39,980
you know we wanna Lake bust monopolies
and it's really great

433
00:24:39,980 --> 00:24:43,940
and then Lake you open your website up
for the internet

434
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:48,590
common friend to you or whatever it is
and then like you just get a lot of spam

435
00:24:48,590 --> 00:24:52,590
sour not a great experience am also
kinda makes you wonder why you went

436
00:24:52,590 --> 00:24:56,399
through all that bother Chile Costa lot
of spammy comments on

437
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:59,560
you know like three pictures approvals
that you thought were great

438
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:03,330
so span handling in lower foreign see
massive adoption

439
00:25:03,330 --> 00:25:06,760
decentralized social media stuff Sam

440
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:10,000
to think about that if you especially if
you hate spam

441
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:14,140
am we can use your help

442
00:25:14,140 --> 00:25:18,220
still a I mention user interface briefly

443
00:25:18,220 --> 00:25:24,380
and this is this is always kind of a
issue it's free software projects

444
00:25:24,380 --> 00:25:29,710
am latah Creek beings really cheerful
user interface

445
00:25:29,710 --> 00:25:33,899
and then they're like play it's so
important net signal in Indy

446
00:25:33,899 --> 00:25:37,690
ended there's a lotta you know you see
this highlighted the

447
00:25:37,690 --> 00:25:41,440
you know here and SIV stuff on the
desktop then

448
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:45,080
people Sam like well if you just jimmy
Eat This Way

449
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:48,280
and then you close it and open it back
up again usually will received your

450
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:51,010
thing the correct way and it's really
fine

451
00:25:51,010 --> 00:25:55,870
most people don t that I'm the O this
might be room for people in early

452
00:25:55,870 --> 00:26:00,250
happy to do that in the leg well you
know game froze again

453
00:26:00,250 --> 00:26:03,399
others close it and open it again and
it's fine

454
00:26:03,399 --> 00:26:07,780
and I am one of those people is the game
for the flights here in

455
00:26:07,780 --> 00:26:11,899
you know and I don't mind but to D mass
adoption or and had to do a really good

456
00:26:11,899 --> 00:26:13,460
job on user interface

457
00:26:13,460 --> 00:26:16,580
and so if your UI person then

458
00:26:16,580 --> 00:26:20,830
this is your chance to shine and come to
their rescue of the Free Software

459
00:26:20,830 --> 00:26:24,928
to centralized web movement Sao am

460
00:26:24,929 --> 00:26:29,120
the other thing is I think also has to
be lot easier

461
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:33,790
cell easy acidified another one and at
another conference and

462
00:26:33,790 --> 00:26:38,580
am and I was told that actually the pool
is really easy

463
00:26:38,580 --> 00:26:41,850
for balloon animals and I didn't know
that am

464
00:26:41,850 --> 00:26:46,040
but I think you can illustrate the point
is that like what is easy to one person

465
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:46,940
is maybe not

466
00:26:46,940 --> 00:26:51,550
easy to another person and im usually
pretty good in my hands banana

467
00:26:51,550 --> 00:26:55,240
I don't know how to make up for a
lateral balloon am

468
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:58,720
and and I think the thinking is Lake you
know

469
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:02,120
there's prolly latter folks in this room
that are like our I'd be totally happy

470
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:03,280
to set up a server

471
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:06,710
early you know jill gene plugin whatever
and

472
00:27:06,710 --> 00:27:10,880
you know run my own and stance and at
the station and machine and check it

473
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:14,230
over the next couple days make sure is
doing okay not getting around this

474
00:27:14,230 --> 00:27:16,179
family never ever

475
00:27:16,179 --> 00:27:19,580
I think for there to be a lot of
adoption

476
00:27:19,580 --> 00:27:23,360
decentralize web services it has to be
jesse's easy as it is to install

477
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:24,909
WordPress on your site

478
00:27:24,909 --> 00:27:29,340
so for it the press at media island
that's our goal is to have a delay

479
00:27:29,340 --> 00:27:32,409
well DUI network pests like yes

480
00:27:32,409 --> 00:27:36,220
Fritz magically on your website and you
want

481
00:27:36,220 --> 00:27:39,659
media that line like yes and no leg

482
00:27:39,659 --> 00:27:43,149
now what happened so thats that's where

483
00:27:43,149 --> 00:27:46,210
after I think the decentralized services
have to go

484
00:27:46,210 --> 00:27:50,890
am so documentation also on super
helpful

485
00:27:50,890 --> 00:27:54,360
there's a couple a different a

486
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:57,950
things like tools that are in the works
that could help sort abstract that

487
00:27:57,950 --> 00:28:00,780
process that might make it a lot easier
in the future

488
00:28:00,780 --> 00:28:05,870
selling me open shifter maybe jude you I
would help assessor abstract

489
00:28:05,870 --> 00:28:09,710
the process have hosting your own web
instance am

490
00:28:09,710 --> 00:28:12,230
I don't know that those are there yet
and I don't know if that's where they

491
00:28:12,230 --> 00:28:15,899
wanna go specifically but there's
there's a there's again there some tools

492
00:28:15,899 --> 00:28:17,390
out there that could be bill

493
00:28:17,390 --> 00:28:21,750
that could make it happen cell I am

494
00:28:21,750 --> 00:28:25,710
so that's that's kinda the that's kinda
where we're at with what turned on

495
00:28:25,710 --> 00:28:26,929
lights not been done

496
00:28:26,929 --> 00:28:30,510
am so

497
00:28:30,510 --> 00:28:34,470
eyeliner on to join the Legion help with
existing practice if your designer

498
00:28:34,470 --> 00:28:35,880
cooder chance later

499
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:41,210
documentaire an especially if the idea
and decentralized spam blocking

500
00:28:41,210 --> 00:28:45,100
appeals to you then that's super
exciting an

501
00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:49,230
if you're interested in building cut in
Sanya and user interface tougher helping

502
00:28:49,230 --> 00:28:51,550
abstract acclaim and then you can come
work with us

503
00:28:51,550 --> 00:28:56,530
media goblin an or start new projects
there's all kinds of other stuff that

504
00:28:56,530 --> 00:28:58,300
could be decentralized a

505
00:28:58,300 --> 00:29:01,590
when things happen I think would be
really cool a city like healthcare

506
00:29:01,590 --> 00:29:02,450
records

507
00:29:02,450 --> 00:29:06,720
be you now plug in place so that when
you move there now Lake

508
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:11,050
let in you can just kinda teacher health
records with you everywhere in

509
00:29:11,050 --> 00:29:14,250
maybe like actually the patient would
control them incentive

510
00:29:14,250 --> 00:29:18,370
hoping that someone sent them on at
traffic might be in a really good one

511
00:29:18,370 --> 00:29:19,320
nationally

512
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:23,370
you know like a here in New York
everything's on a great I live in Boston

513
00:29:23,370 --> 00:29:25,140
and and we like to say it was all

514
00:29:25,140 --> 00:29:30,270
built by Cal paths and silly traffic in
boston is really different and traffic

515
00:29:30,270 --> 00:29:31,040
in New York

516
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:34,879
well you might sometime find yourself
driving from New York to Boston are back

517
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:35,630
again

518
00:29:35,630 --> 00:29:39,909
and then you would wanna be able to hook
up to like seamlessly do another kinda

519
00:29:39,909 --> 00:29:40,500
traffic

520
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:44,060
application that I gave you like
meaningful

521
00:29:44,060 --> 00:29:48,370
Lake good alternate routes to get around
the Fenway Park or whatever

522
00:29:48,370 --> 00:29:51,480
so and silly other kinds are proud as I

523
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:55,250
acid think Lee may be dating profiles I
don't know there's kind at Lake

524
00:29:55,250 --> 00:29:57,919
there's gotta be money in that one at
least like I don't know if the other

525
00:29:57,919 --> 00:29:58,880
stuff like

526
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:02,850
maybe by Lake if you could take your
dating profile with you

527
00:30:02,850 --> 00:30:06,909
you know once it was like I'll no one
really likes nerve dot com anymore they

528
00:30:06,909 --> 00:30:08,820
own over OK Cupid in

529
00:30:08,820 --> 00:30:12,530
now fill in on this stuff and find other
picture I look good

530
00:30:12,530 --> 00:30:15,550
you now and bathing suit or whatever it
is and

531
00:30:15,550 --> 00:30:20,210
you know if you take it with you and
just plug it in like now I'm cooler here

532
00:30:20,210 --> 00:30:24,700
so there might be an online am ironic
that once the most socially useful but I

533
00:30:24,700 --> 00:30:26,919
S polymers liquored up to

534
00:30:26,919 --> 00:30:31,350
an and speak your money if you wanna do
any other things and you just wanna

535
00:30:31,350 --> 00:30:37,730
funded decentralize project let me know
and a hug you up

536
00:30:37,730 --> 00:30:41,159
so I'm gonna take questions I spoke
really fast

537
00:30:41,159 --> 00:30:44,320
am sell it I stuff my mess and there's

538
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:51,320
how things people announce our yeah

539
00:30:59,770 --> 00:31:02,809
right to harass has media that unlike in
specific

540
00:31:02,809 --> 00:31:07,710
so we're at the point where we're doing
a great job hosting video and images and

541
00:31:07,710 --> 00:31:10,140
not agree to have a survey across
instances

542
00:31:10,140 --> 00:31:13,710
where the passes in implementing a lot
at the identical staff and so

543
00:31:13,710 --> 00:31:17,230
to basically everyone has their own
database we had a

544
00:31:17,230 --> 00:31:20,659
we had a deal is when we had picked out
a database at first we had picked up

545
00:31:20,659 --> 00:31:23,890
Mongo because it skills up like a measly
well

546
00:31:23,890 --> 00:31:27,230
and then I realized like our totally
thinking and wrong

547
00:31:27,230 --> 00:31:31,809
because we want a lot of small databases
and manga doesn't scaled-down really

548
00:31:31,809 --> 00:31:32,549
gracefully

549
00:31:32,549 --> 00:31:36,620
to switch back to my skill sets like a
lotta everyone has their own like mass

550
00:31:36,620 --> 00:31:37,850
killer sq a light

551
00:31:37,850 --> 00:31:41,510
database and net talks to the other ones
using like post

552
00:31:41,510 --> 00:31:45,440
so its a said it is that kind of player

553
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:52,440
yeah

554
00:32:05,129 --> 00:32:09,159
allright like is the replication said
that if once I get shut down that stuff

555
00:32:09,159 --> 00:32:10,169
yes still

556
00:32:10,169 --> 00:32:13,179
that is something are sorting like what
do we wanna have

557
00:32:13,179 --> 00:32:16,239
nearing like if people wanna share other
people's photos

558
00:32:16,239 --> 00:32:20,230
so I think it would be like an apt in
and not like a default so not like Skype

559
00:32:20,230 --> 00:32:22,759
or you have other people's traffic
running through your machine

560
00:32:22,759 --> 00:32:27,700
but more like an apt and so that you
could decide like okay I'm alright with

561
00:32:27,700 --> 00:32:29,399
hosting other people's traffic in

562
00:32:29,399 --> 00:32:32,989
am creating a match so that there's
redundancy to

563
00:32:32,989 --> 00:32:39,989
am other here in here

564
00:32:49,010 --> 00:32:54,350
yeah I am so the question is it sound
like it's focused and servers and things

565
00:32:54,350 --> 00:32:55,300
like that am

566
00:32:55,300 --> 00:32:58,320
I A yeah I'll there are Lake

567
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:03,399
a example instances a identical and have
me goblin setup

568
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:06,810
that people can look at but I'll we are
at a lake

569
00:33:06,810 --> 00:33:10,710
in the passes are pulling people and
they take a look at the processor

570
00:33:10,710 --> 00:33:14,760
trend like if he did said appear an
instance like where did you get stuck so

571
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:16,129
that we can make that part better

572
00:33:16,130 --> 00:33:20,610
so I we do one and users like if you
love to complain about your experience

573
00:33:20,610 --> 00:33:21,750
on the internet or

574
00:33:21,750 --> 00:33:25,120
and your experience down downloading or
installing something then

575
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:29,110
cut let me know cell am I have that
answer your question

576
00:33:29,110 --> 00:33:33,270
nyse: Ackley can use can you say it
louder than

577
00:33:33,270 --> 00:33:40,270
an app yeah

578
00:33:43,990 --> 00:33:48,030
okay so can you run a that's the goal is
that a yes

579
00:33:48,030 --> 00:33:53,090
it's just but it it's a little it's
still a little more difficult than we'd

580
00:33:53,090 --> 00:33:54,560
like it to be for the average user

581
00:33:54,560 --> 00:34:01,560
yeah okay and in a white shirt and then
a lynn

582
00:34:16,829 --> 00:34:23,829
right

583
00:34:25,409 --> 00:34:25,730
it

584
00:34:25,730 --> 00:34:29,649
runway you wanted to run an is I'm sorry
say the last part on your fam

585
00:34:29,649 --> 00:34:33,489
yeah and I agree I think you would want
to run on your phone

586
00:34:33,490 --> 00:34:37,240
and that Pardo I think doing good UI is
that lay people aren't

587
00:34:37,240 --> 00:34:43,049
Lake I mean its I'll

588
00:34:43,049 --> 00:34:50,049
I see what your saying so that the phone
is actually a server yeah

589
00:34:50,819 --> 00:34:57,819
yeah

590
00:35:00,530 --> 00:35:07,530
mmm

591
00:35:16,510 --> 00:35:20,030
yeah anything that's awesome I'd like to
see people in the audience our fans a

592
00:35:20,030 --> 00:35:20,809
server's I

593
00:35:20,809 --> 00:35:25,079
weir's still stuck on where I think it's
hard for people to set up a server just

594
00:35:25,079 --> 00:35:25,829
on their

595
00:35:25,829 --> 00:35:29,270
her machine but that I yeah exactly

596
00:35:29,270 --> 00:35:36,270
sour he took your comment okay

597
00:35:42,519 --> 00:35:49,519
hmm mmm-hmm mmm

598
00:35:50,740 --> 00:35:57,740
yeah

599
00:36:21,060 --> 00:36:23,000
till

600
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:26,830
yeah said that diana for recording I
would have but that

601
00:36:26,830 --> 00:36:31,620
the the point is that a TIV we need like
another thing that is

602
00:36:31,620 --> 00:36:36,569
as ubiquitous as a DNS that is more
friendly and Federation

603
00:36:36,570 --> 00:36:40,000
and could be run of em okay I think
that'd be awesome

604
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:47,000
am here and many here yeah

605
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:57,490
sale USA people urging her research into

606
00:36:57,490 --> 00:37:04,490
protocols and I is

607
00:37:12,619 --> 00:37:15,359
%uh oh yeah well I do you think it still
am

608
00:37:15,359 --> 00:37:20,119
again cuz building a 3-2 loss there's so
many other just centralized services are

609
00:37:20,119 --> 00:37:20,680
also

610
00:37:20,680 --> 00:37:24,319
using I think that a it Lake

611
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:27,470
if there was a her call like a nerdy and
asked if this thing

612
00:37:27,470 --> 00:37:30,790
that L but to have a work with all the
existing

613
00:37:30,790 --> 00:37:34,300
a lot of toolset would be really good so
hanging on for

614
00:37:34,300 --> 00:37:37,720
the link for that a lot of stuff if you
want afterwards an

615
00:37:37,720 --> 00:37:42,780
yeah I do think that having just
centralizers is use a common

616
00:37:42,780 --> 00:37:47,190
protocol and common tools so that they
cannot talk to each other

617
00:37:47,190 --> 00:37:51,250
would be the way to go and there are
tools that are being bill is on the same

618
00:37:51,250 --> 00:37:52,089
stuff silly

619
00:37:52,089 --> 00:37:56,480
salmon is being used in a lot a
different an application so far

620
00:37:56,480 --> 00:38:00,369
and then up up somehow love is another
one is being used in a lot different

621
00:38:00,369 --> 00:38:02,000
application so far said they

622
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:06,270
they are being built to kinda plug and
play with each other is that

623
00:38:06,270 --> 00:38:10,369
that's kinda what okay call and then a
or by the pool

624
00:38:10,369 --> 00:38:17,369
yeah

625
00:38:17,530 --> 00:38:22,569
yeah

626
00:38:22,569 --> 00:38:26,390
yeah that's why it did that once like
kinda

627
00:38:26,390 --> 00:38:30,420
there is something but it's not like
people aren't super psyched to integrate

628
00:38:30,420 --> 00:38:31,319
it yet so

629
00:38:31,319 --> 00:38:34,680
an of it needs to like optimize the
existing

630
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:38,740
to centralize search or it might be too
much work to do that

631
00:38:38,740 --> 00:38:45,740
well

632
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:56,920
okay

633
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:15,320
up

634
00:39:16,660 --> 00:39:23,500
the maker formats yet sometime this year
and sometimes it's

635
00:39:23,500 --> 00:39:30,500
it depends on thirsty the current
service I write that down but

636
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:47,829
right well and I think about this man is

637
00:39:47,829 --> 00:39:51,319
a eat something that works today and

638
00:39:51,319 --> 00:39:55,109
me at work and a month because there
with it

639
00:39:55,109 --> 00:39:58,308
we get span is always changing its like
a constant

640
00:39:58,309 --> 00:40:03,019
you now back in for sale as soon as we
figure out then

641
00:40:03,019 --> 00:40:07,900
you know anything like this in a tad
subject to spammers this word is spam

642
00:40:07,900 --> 00:40:11,880
are coming from ninety reas fan or
whatever then

643
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:15,569
Lei gets routed from somewhere else are
they put something on Sina subject so it

644
00:40:15,569 --> 00:40:19,049
it's like that has to be here ongoing

645
00:40:19,049 --> 00:40:23,930
system a pushing out like standard so
might be a subscription model and

646
00:40:23,930 --> 00:40:27,220
and you're right then it would depend on
who do you trust to

647
00:40:27,220 --> 00:40:34,220
subscribe to for spam

648
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:44,390
yeah

649
00:40:44,390 --> 00:40:48,420
fair have had is that I talk to vote
would be looking for free suffer

650
00:40:48,420 --> 00:40:52,310
solution and I don't mean necessarily
freezing cost-benefit sprite proprietary

651
00:40:52,310 --> 00:40:53,310
I don't think they be

652
00:40:53,310 --> 00:40:58,859
interested in integrating it it is free
software okay I wasn't

653
00:40:58,859 --> 00:41:05,859
okay

654
00:41:10,040 --> 00:41:14,050
asserts yet get a premium thing yeah

655
00:41:14,050 --> 00:41:18,730
cell yeah it's interesting so they're
running a business on that would

656
00:41:18,730 --> 00:41:23,070
prolly one chat with them rather than
just grab it and forget

657
00:41:23,070 --> 00:41:26,680
I am but yeah now look now in a an

658
00:41:26,680 --> 00:41:30,118
there a unit there a

659
00:41:30,119 --> 00:41:34,430
HIV interest to finally hours under the
hood and what it will work with

660
00:41:34,430 --> 00:41:39,399
I know there Tom you know low depending
on the project there's always

661
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:44,690
like what languages in NN some people
are very anti PHP and another project

662
00:41:44,690 --> 00:41:45,109
sir

663
00:41:45,109 --> 00:41:48,580
hey Pro PHP and so it had to work
correctly

664
00:41:48,580 --> 00:41:55,580
the standards

665
00:42:03,080 --> 00:42:04,440
okay yeah

666
00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:09,200
item now things and I'm glad I love like
hearing on another project I didn't know

667
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:09,610
about

668
00:42:09,610 --> 00:42:14,770
sec that marketing is not err especially
over here in trees offer usually

669
00:42:14,770 --> 00:42:18,160
to I'm always happy to hear about other
stuff and there's

670
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:25,160
and a question and back here her

671
00:42:48,530 --> 00:42:51,829
yet there would be permissions you
undoubtedly

672
00:42:51,829 --> 00:42:55,500
you're just subscribe to stuff if you
want more stuff like

673
00:42:55,500 --> 00:42:59,070
to good nervy set up where it just
pushes things to your machine

674
00:42:59,070 --> 00:43:04,579
an is that eg you want to clarify you
can clarify your question

675
00:43:04,579 --> 00:43:11,579
yeah

676
00:43:12,619 --> 00:43:17,930
now rate

677
00:43:17,930 --> 00:43:21,259
still arm yeah and

678
00:43:21,260 --> 00:43:25,310
any similar media collages on a must
shower and

679
00:43:25,310 --> 00:43:29,990
they be serving videos and images and
maybe ASCII art if they want to

680
00:43:29,990 --> 00:43:35,599
and and then they would be able to set
exactly how they want to share it they

681
00:43:35,599 --> 00:43:36,410
could share it

682
00:43:36,410 --> 00:43:40,089
only by invite they can share it with
the entire internet they could share

683
00:43:40,089 --> 00:43:43,230
on a handful of people or with a group

684
00:43:43,230 --> 00:43:46,550
I think one of the things it's really
interesting and there would be

685
00:43:46,550 --> 00:43:49,599
to be on a customized shared a tad bit
like a group

686
00:43:49,599 --> 00:43:54,069
still a calm one easy bill that we think
about one where

687
00:43:54,069 --> 00:43:57,960
working on me and alan is there Lake you
know kids like to take pictures

688
00:43:57,960 --> 00:44:01,700
at elementary school like the planter
the journal or whatever and

689
00:44:01,700 --> 00:44:05,700
no decrease if they could automatically
share with other elementary schools but

690
00:44:05,700 --> 00:44:09,819
not the entire internet so you know you
don't want someone going like well he

691
00:44:09,819 --> 00:44:13,490
has Larry doing nice some Rando from the
street where larry is the

692
00:44:13,490 --> 00:44:18,290
durable am and so it so anyway there's a
lotta and

693
00:44:18,290 --> 00:44:21,970
like I think that being able to
customize the way you share is actually

694
00:44:21,970 --> 00:44:22,650
like the

695
00:44:22,650 --> 00:44:26,359
most exciting part having to centralized
system

696
00:44:26,359 --> 00:44:29,910
this that it's not like you're everyone
are no one it could be

697
00:44:29,910 --> 00:44:33,020
much more family controlled so

698
00:44:33,020 --> 00:44:37,079
Anna and we're still working on a
technical pieces oh how did you all

699
00:44:37,079 --> 00:44:37,609
others

700
00:44:37,609 --> 00:44:42,799
that's so an you know if you're super
interested in you wanna

701
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:45,970
health out let me now am

702
00:44:45,970 --> 00:44:50,020
I think I one here and and then I see
how I am time

703
00:44:50,020 --> 00:44:53,509
I will attack okay yeah

704
00:44:53,510 --> 00:45:00,510
retro share huh

705
00:45:07,199 --> 00:45:13,230
mmm

706
00:45:13,230 --> 00:45:17,010
yeah it still arm 21st and looking at
idea

707
00:45:17,010 --> 00:45:20,770
ahead centralized social media stuff

708
00:45:20,770 --> 00:45:25,930
an we were really thinking and we had
all these like that you know Alice and

709
00:45:25,930 --> 00:45:26,990
Bob and

710
00:45:26,990 --> 00:45:30,559
she you know Charles and everybody on
the whiteboard trying to figure out how

711
00:45:30,559 --> 00:45:31,220
they would share

712
00:45:31,220 --> 00:45:36,319
Anna and we realize that a lot of folks
at had the idea of like building social

713
00:45:36,319 --> 00:45:37,509
media and Topher

714
00:45:37,510 --> 00:45:40,520
I G PG year PDP Anna

715
00:45:40,520 --> 00:45:44,770
it was it was kinda interesting and and
all of them have like sign that seem

716
00:45:44,770 --> 00:45:47,109
like it's not really a reserve friendly

717
00:45:47,109 --> 00:45:51,328
and allow this totally understand the
algorithms and it's awesome

718
00:45:51,329 --> 00:45:55,680
and still yeah I now look at their mid
you know I'm sure it's

719
00:45:55,680 --> 00:45:59,038
than tally free suffer too on yeah at
some

720
00:45:59,039 --> 00:46:06,039
right

721
00:46:15,450 --> 00:46:18,950
it says that your matching kind thing
that PDP is

722
00:46:18,950 --> 00:46:23,510
an you now sort of encapsulated okay

723
00:46:23,510 --> 00:46:27,880
CAW surrender share microformats and
snort

724
00:46:27,880 --> 00:46:33,280
setting our sights on a new project and
if people any other questions or

725
00:46:33,280 --> 00:46:37,390
the about formats our projects are
things okay

726
00:46:37,390 --> 00:46:40,589
a comment sweater alright 0

727
00:46:40,589 --> 00:46:44,819
only in the back behind their projector
yeah that's okay

728
00:46:44,819 --> 00:46:51,819
yeah

729
00:46:58,890 --> 00:47:05,890
yeah

730
00:47:12,020 --> 00:47:16,420
yeah

731
00:47:16,420 --> 00:47:20,340
yeah well there's two pieces there's the

732
00:47:20,340 --> 00:47:23,970
life feels like when a get over here did
the decentralized

733
00:47:23,970 --> 00:47:29,020
area and I suspect for most people it
feels like going from like

734
00:47:29,020 --> 00:47:35,630
a lonely you know velveteen so for to
Lake a crummy sorta broken

735
00:47:35,630 --> 00:47:39,880
folding chair and nasa thats that's less
than ideal

736
00:47:39,880 --> 00:47:45,410
the other thing is that I am their
friends are still on the other services

737
00:47:45,410 --> 00:47:49,560
cell am yet so it needs to happen and
big

738
00:47:49,560 --> 00:47:54,380
piles and anonymity awesome when people
get here I think this year kinda

739
00:47:54,380 --> 00:47:57,410
in early did say that when they get to

740
00:47:57,410 --> 00:48:00,520
like the new thing it might be that has
a different functionality

741
00:48:00,520 --> 00:48:04,030
we've done a good job of communicating
like how much more

742
00:48:04,030 --> 00:48:08,290
awesome it is to control how you share
or how much more awesome it is to

743
00:48:08,290 --> 00:48:10,529
customize the your page Luxor

744
00:48:10,530 --> 00:48:14,740
something like that and that all really
works in all works really great

745
00:48:14,740 --> 00:48:19,280
so then they go to their friend in LA
yeah member has a person 80 D that

746
00:48:19,280 --> 00:48:21,690
Friendster was dominant where are moving
on

747
00:48:21,690 --> 00:48:25,170
like I'm telling you again we're all
going over today Astra

748
00:48:25,170 --> 00:48:30,140
sellick has to be like that I think an a
here in an hour here

749
00:48:30,140 --> 00:48:36,830
he

750
00:48:36,830 --> 00:48:43,830
hmm

751
00:48:46,060 --> 00:48:53,060
mmm

752
00:48:57,720 --> 00:49:01,340
mmm

753
00:49:01,340 --> 00:49:08,340
yeah

754
00:49:16,490 --> 00:49:18,830
yeah

755
00:49:18,830 --> 00:49:22,049
now I think being a lot like for people
to be able to take their network with

756
00:49:22,050 --> 00:49:24,200
Emory is a different thing on top would

757
00:49:24,200 --> 00:49:28,450
there's a little work in that area that
might be really good way to transition

758
00:49:28,450 --> 00:49:29,260
people

759
00:49:29,260 --> 00:49:36,260
out here oh and okay

760
00:49:45,039 --> 00:49:52,039
CAW am I think we had one area and then
another and then we might be done

761
00:49:58,390 --> 00:50:05,390
only did yet well briefly

762
