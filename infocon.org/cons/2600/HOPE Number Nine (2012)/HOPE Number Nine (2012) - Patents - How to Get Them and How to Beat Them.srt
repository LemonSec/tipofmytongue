1
00:00:00,049 --> 00:00:06,680
patent attorney I

2
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:07,100
this

3
00:00:07,100 --> 00:00:11,410
talk is intended to be a sort of
practical

4
00:00:11,410 --> 00:00:15,260
guide I suppose

5
00:00:15,260 --> 00:00:18,920
I am it's not really intended to get

6
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:22,040
into philosophical justifications

7
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:26,419
for patents but i wanna start of just to
gauge my audience

8
00:00:26,420 --> 00:00:29,770
um I wanna know first of all are there

9
00:00:29,770 --> 00:00:34,000
how many among you think that the patent
system is generally a good idea and

10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,079
works pretty well

11
00:00:35,079 --> 00:00:38,879
well

12
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:42,928
that the second question is refinement
because the second question is whether

13
00:00:42,929 --> 00:00:46,760
how many among you think that the patent
system is a good idea

14
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:50,050
but doesn't work particularly well and
could use improvement

15
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:54,559
okay and how many if you think that the
patent system is a fundamentally

16
00:00:54,559 --> 00:00:57,739
bad idea okay

17
00:00:57,739 --> 00:01:03,569
I mean better a better place and I kinda
expected to be alright

18
00:01:03,569 --> 00:01:08,040
um the way the stock is going to go as I
have a few

19
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:11,650
goals I I want to teach you how to read
a patent

20
00:01:11,650 --> 00:01:15,890
how to be basically when you have that
legal document in your hand

21
00:01:15,890 --> 00:01:19,290
how to extract from it the important
information

22
00:01:19,290 --> 00:01:23,290
I want to teach you how to to use these
patents

23
00:01:23,290 --> 00:01:27,230
effectively for your own purposes and
that can mean

24
00:01:27,230 --> 00:01:30,660
if you are %um an entrepreneur or
start-up

25
00:01:30,660 --> 00:01:33,700
how to go about seeking patent
protection

26
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:37,060
and it can also mean how to defend
yourself against

27
00:01:37,060 --> 00:01:41,160
a.m. others shorts you know trying to
keep you down

28
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:45,350
and finally I the that last four point I
want to raise the level of discourse on

29
00:01:45,350 --> 00:01:46,100
Slashdot

30
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:52,010
because God damn every time I read a
patent article on Slashdot makes me cry

31
00:01:52,010 --> 00:01:55,670
%uh

32
00:01:55,670 --> 00:01:58,800
okay so the basic idea why we have
patents is

33
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:02,040
their valuable I am the way our system
is set up

34
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:05,880
is you can extract money from a patent

35
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:09,379
I am usually by using it against people

36
00:02:09,378 --> 00:02:13,290
um in the in the basically in the form

37
00:02:13,290 --> 00:02:17,700
love licensing in a in a more benign
sense and in the form of litigation

38
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:22,350
anymore ha style sense the idea is that
once you have this document once you

39
00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:23,859
have this patent protection

40
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:28,390
you on the monopoly on that patent and
you're the only one who's allowed to use

41
00:02:28,390 --> 00:02:31,060
it other people can pay you for the
right to use it

42
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:35,410
or you can then go and find people who
are infringing

43
00:02:35,410 --> 00:02:40,510
and make them stop using it to get into
a little bit more

44
00:02:40,510 --> 00:02:43,720
how you use patents for defense though
on

45
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:47,000
there's kinda and unfortunate have a
witch hunt

46
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:51,160
sure you're all very familiar with among
patent holders

47
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:54,890
which is basically shake down their
competitors on

48
00:02:54,890 --> 00:03:00,060
it is of indicate there there are a few
companies who just have obscene

49
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:03,230
numbers at Pats and I say that as a
patent attorney who

50
00:03:03,230 --> 00:03:06,519
makes I A makes my money of the past
they just have

51
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:09,800
a rediculous number and so what they can
do

52
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:14,160
just by virtue up the sheer mass up
their patent holdings they can go up to

53
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:14,970
competitor

54
00:03:14,970 --> 00:03:18,609
with that out any patents are with your
pants and say hey

55
00:03:18,610 --> 00:03:23,380
really care if you actually infringe any
of these guys we had 10,000

56
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:27,810
this year on so how about we crossed let
you know

57
00:03:27,810 --> 00:03:30,849
you license this from us for one who
actually in dollars

58
00:03:30,849 --> 00:03:35,569
thank you very much so the way you use
patents defensively

59
00:03:35,569 --> 00:03:40,099
is as a deterrent and if you have a
stockpile of patents have your say up

60
00:03:40,099 --> 00:03:40,730
your own

61
00:03:40,730 --> 00:03:44,819
you essentially create a mutually a
surge had destruction scenario

62
00:03:44,819 --> 00:03:49,190
and you can file a countersuit or cross
tyson's or whatever

63
00:03:49,190 --> 00:03:53,340
cell but once you have that

64
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:57,830
but patent document in hand I its its
kinda complicated

65
00:03:57,830 --> 00:04:02,980
thing and if you don't have actual like
if you're not a lawyer it can often be

66
00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:04,459
hard to squeeze out a bit

67
00:04:04,459 --> 00:04:07,640
exactly what is going on but the the
idea that

68
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:11,890
underline the whole patent system is
that you're making a trade

69
00:04:11,890 --> 00:04:16,340
you're giving your you're putting into
this document everything somebody having

70
00:04:16,340 --> 00:04:19,449
ordinary skill in the art whatever that
may be

71
00:04:19,449 --> 00:04:22,810
you're giving that person the ability to

72
00:04:22,810 --> 00:04:26,650
use your idea and to implement that
bench

73
00:04:26,650 --> 00:04:29,929
so I've got here an example of a patent
it's got a whole bunch of stuff

74
00:04:29,930 --> 00:04:33,990
and we're going to get into that on

75
00:04:33,990 --> 00:04:37,990
on the left hand side you have sorted
basic I

76
00:04:37,990 --> 00:04:43,169
formal legal stuff this includes the
filing dated the patent the priority

77
00:04:43,169 --> 00:04:44,549
date at the patent knees kinda

78
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:50,040
determine on how that patents lifetime
is going to go

79
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:53,540
if you look at the upper right hand
corner there you have the date

80
00:04:53,540 --> 00:04:58,800
%uh issue of the patent which is the day
it becomes legally enforceable

81
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:02,330
and then you have some more general
information about that pat

82
00:05:02,330 --> 00:05:06,190
the references were considered in
judging whether it was valid

83
00:05:06,190 --> 00:05:10,100
and just a quick abstract what's going
on inside

84
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:15,419
a patent lifetime on is not a and
immediately clear cut thing

85
00:05:15,419 --> 00:05:19,919
just because they keep changing it on in
1995

86
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:23,539
anything file before then you have a
lifetime of seventeen years from the

87
00:05:23,540 --> 00:05:24,010
date

88
00:05:24,010 --> 00:05:29,580
issue so from the date on the top right
hand corner

89
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:34,900
after 1995 its a twenty year period from
the date of filing

90
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:37,919
and there's a very good reason for why
the change that on

91
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:41,340
for a while there were what were called
submarine patents

92
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:45,729
where somebody would file a patent and
just keep in prosecution

93
00:05:45,729 --> 00:05:49,260
keep in in the on Patent Office

94
00:05:49,260 --> 00:05:54,010
four decades and just keep going and
going and going until somebody

95
00:05:54,010 --> 00:05:58,750
finally started to use that technology
and then they would pop up on sale yet

96
00:05:58,750 --> 00:06:03,220
willa we'll take that up at now and go
see that guy

97
00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:07,830
I'm so they fixed that problem in the do
keep trying to fix the problems in the

98
00:06:07,830 --> 00:06:10,320
system it's not a complete vacuum

99
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:14,590
I am and in fact just just last year
they fire

100
00:06:14,590 --> 00:06:18,880
day day Congress passed and they got
signed into law

101
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:22,120
a new set up at reforms which arguably

102
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:29,120
address some of the issues

103
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:32,979
so the way as a patent is broken down as
you have

104
00:06:32,979 --> 00:06:36,520
these three basic components: you have
the written specification

105
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:40,280
the drawings and at the end the set of
claims and I'm gonna go into a little

106
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:42,030
bit of depth for what each of these

107
00:06:42,030 --> 00:06:45,040
is and how you can go about breaking
them down

108
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:48,610
on the specification in the drawings
have the purposive actually

109
00:06:48,610 --> 00:06:50,780
communicating the information

110
00:06:50,780 --> 00:06:54,610
%uh how to implement this invention

111
00:06:54,610 --> 00:06:58,729
so that's the part that that satisfies
the indentures and if the bargain

112
00:06:58,729 --> 00:07:02,270
they make they put together this
specification and drawings hopefully

113
00:07:02,270 --> 00:07:06,479
in a clear and understandable way said
that some it so that you guys can sit

114
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:07,340
down

115
00:07:07,340 --> 00:07:12,979
and twenty years after the filing
actually use it

116
00:07:12,979 --> 00:07:16,340
so I have a rear for the last time I
gave a talk like this had a golf ball

117
00:07:16,340 --> 00:07:16,699
but I

118
00:07:16,699 --> 00:07:19,770
shows a more appropriate example this is
one of the first

119
00:07:19,770 --> 00:07:23,180
I'm mouse is from Apple add

120
00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:26,639
that's the a patent drawing that they
use to describe it

121
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:29,810
and then below and I have a bit of the
texts

122
00:07:29,810 --> 00:07:34,139
on and the way this works is everything
in the patents is described invert

123
00:07:34,139 --> 00:07:38,470
with reference to the drawings you know
there may be some sort of narrative

124
00:07:38,470 --> 00:07:40,220
descriptive text

125
00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:43,490
but the meat I love it is really going
to come down to the strong and what

126
00:07:43,490 --> 00:07:43,820
those

127
00:07:43,820 --> 00:07:47,560
individual reference numbers indicate

128
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:53,370
on the important thing to remember when
you're reading the specification

129
00:07:53,370 --> 00:07:56,490
is that it does not and I

130
00:07:56,490 --> 00:08:00,169
upgraded underline that does not

131
00:08:00,169 --> 00:08:04,030
define what this patent covers and this
gets back to

132
00:08:04,030 --> 00:08:07,940
why I wanted raise the level of
discourse about this stuff because

133
00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:11,490
a what happens a lot of the time when I
breed discussions about patents

134
00:08:11,490 --> 00:08:14,770
is somebody picks up patent that is you
know a

135
00:08:14,770 --> 00:08:20,759
a minor improvements on some particular
coolly in some system

136
00:08:20,759 --> 00:08:24,669
but in order to explain that first they
explain what a gooey is

137
00:08:24,669 --> 00:08:28,599
and they explain what a window is and
you know how a mouse works

138
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:31,819
and city you know some somebody who
picks this up

139
00:08:31,819 --> 00:08:36,240
says patenting gooey scores jerks we've
been doing do is for

140
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:40,709
millions in two years I'll just because
it's in the specification

141
00:08:40,709 --> 00:08:44,500
doesn't mean you're actually bounds by
it

142
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:51,500
the legal scope of the patent comes from
the claims

143
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:57,399
the question is is there a risk I've if
you are in in venture

144
00:08:57,399 --> 00:09:00,420
%uh meeting your patent when you write
your specification

145
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:04,250
the answer is yes if you state in your
specification

146
00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:07,520
we can't do X and then somebody comes
out and does X

147
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:12,709
or we do not use this particular
material in our structure

148
00:09:12,709 --> 00:09:15,800
and somebody does you've basically
disclaims that

149
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:20,610
the idea of this document is snot only
so that you can

150
00:09:20,610 --> 00:09:23,779
implemented but also city you know the

151
00:09:23,779 --> 00:09:27,700
explicit scope so

152
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:30,770
when reading this document you take it
as a whole

153
00:09:30,770 --> 00:09:35,290
to sort of finds the boundaries but in
order to find what it covers

154
00:09:35,290 --> 00:09:39,079
you look at the claims and if you look
on the right hand side there

155
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:42,980
that is part up the claim up that maps

156
00:09:42,980 --> 00:09:47,589
it goes on quite a bit more on just to
give you an idea

157
00:09:47,589 --> 00:09:50,800
that not all patents are these
ridiculously broad

158
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:54,640
on we did a thing with the thing kind
approaches

159
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:57,910
um I and I get to get the impression
that a lot of people kinda think pat's

160
00:09:57,910 --> 00:09:58,810
that way or at least

161
00:09:58,810 --> 00:10:02,510
in their most to generate form that's
what they are on

162
00:10:02,510 --> 00:10:05,860
in order to infringe this claim you need
to make sure

163
00:10:05,860 --> 00:10:09,019
you need to have something that covers
every single point

164
00:10:09,019 --> 00:10:12,990
there not jest the explicit

165
00:10:12,990 --> 00:10:16,330
his knee on not just the

166
00:10:16,330 --> 00:10:20,390
explicit statement up we have a wheel it
has a ball

167
00:10:20,390 --> 00:10:24,380
ball moves on the wheel it turned thing
but also the interrelations between

168
00:10:24,380 --> 00:10:26,330
those parts of you have

169
00:10:26,330 --> 00:10:29,589
if this were to explicitly say we have a
ball in an enclosure

170
00:10:29,589 --> 00:10:32,930
and your ball is on the outside of the
enclosure

171
00:10:32,930 --> 00:10:37,730
that doesn't infringe the patent this
breaks it down a little bit more

172
00:10:37,730 --> 00:10:41,450
the band is broken down into the
preamble which generally doesn't have

173
00:10:41,450 --> 00:10:42,959
too much

174
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:47,870
I am wat it's just saying what kind of
thing we're talking about in this case

175
00:10:47,870 --> 00:10:51,310
a device for providing signals

176
00:10:51,310 --> 00:10:55,860
dot dot dot on and then you get into
various claims structure

177
00:10:55,860 --> 00:11:00,029
in this case the housing a unitary frame

178
00:11:00,029 --> 00:11:04,279
and so on and then find going even
further in

179
00:11:04,279 --> 00:11:08,529
limiting language that establishes what
these things do how they relate to each

180
00:11:08,529 --> 00:11:09,959
other and how the whole thing

181
00:11:09,959 --> 00:11:13,420
works on

182
00:11:13,420 --> 00:11:17,819
you have in addition dependent claims so
you can imagine claim number one

183
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:21,149
is an independent claim it stands on its
own

184
00:11:21,149 --> 00:11:25,450
the deep end in claims you can think of
his backups every deep any claim is a

185
00:11:25,450 --> 00:11:27,310
further elaboration

186
00:11:27,310 --> 00:11:31,589
on what came before it so claim to
depends of claim 1

187
00:11:31,589 --> 00:11:35,000
claim three of claim to claim for of
claim 3

188
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,680
and E so this going to come into play
later

189
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:41,880
when we talk about how to invalidate a
patent

190
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:45,709
because every time you knock out iPad
like a

191
00:11:45,709 --> 00:11:50,269
acclaim you haven't necessarily taking
care deep any claims

192
00:11:50,269 --> 00:11:54,079
on you have like I said you have to make
sure every one of those elements is hit

193
00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:56,070
so if you find peace prior art just

194
00:11:56,070 --> 00:12:00,640
foreshadow a little bit that covers all
of claim 1 but doesn't cover claim to

195
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:07,640
claim to is still alive

196
00:12:09,290 --> 00:12:12,719
yes on each each feature each word

197
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:15,800
in this claim on limits the

198
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:18,980
minutes that legal scope of that claim
so the look im

199
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:23,570
just answer to a quick glance the longer
a claim the more specific the invention

200
00:12:23,570 --> 00:12:24,050
is

201
00:12:24,050 --> 00:12:31,050
and every deep any claim tax more
language onto that

202
00:12:46,850 --> 00:12:51,450
the question is at what point do the
claims need to be specific enough that

203
00:12:51,450 --> 00:12:54,610
they're actually patentable with the
example love being claim 1

204
00:12:54,610 --> 00:12:58,010
and object claim to an object that
doesn't thing

205
00:12:58,010 --> 00:13:01,620
claim 3 the object where in this thing

206
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:06,269
is but indicating with signals the
position the cursor

207
00:13:06,269 --> 00:13:09,290
and you know the answer is if it gets to
a patent

208
00:13:09,290 --> 00:13:12,949
every single one of those claims needs
to be

209
00:13:12,950 --> 00:13:16,120
patentable on during prosecution and I'm

210
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:19,870
again this is foreshadowing a bit during
prosecution when you are

211
00:13:19,870 --> 00:13:24,079
getting a patent on it's a dialogue with
the patent office

212
00:13:24,079 --> 00:13:26,930
and they're going to reject your claims
and you're going to try and convince

213
00:13:26,930 --> 00:13:29,040
them why they're wrong

214
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:32,899
so on this process is called patent
prosecution

215
00:13:32,899 --> 00:13:36,100
I'll hey I just said that prosecution
convinced

216
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:40,200
I consists of convincing federal
employees that they are incorrect which

217
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:45,320
on I will say is often difficult and
that's why they pay me

218
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:50,570
on and if they're not wrong you then
change the claims to make some rock

219
00:13:50,570 --> 00:13:54,630
on and so that's what I do that's my
profession I argue

220
00:13:54,630 --> 00:13:59,589
with patent examiners and hope to
eventually get something useful for the

221
00:13:59,589 --> 00:14:01,089
client out of that

222
00:14:01,089 --> 00:14:04,190
on in addition to the personal
satisfaction

223
00:14:04,190 --> 00:14:09,190
that I Drive from so this process has
couple steps

224
00:14:09,190 --> 00:14:14,070
on you start off by creating the patent
application and you continue with that

225
00:14:14,070 --> 00:14:17,139
process love prosecution um

226
00:14:17,139 --> 00:14:21,600
when you're creating an application and
generally this is also part of my job

227
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:24,820
we take a disclosure from the inventor

228
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:28,260
which hopefully is well developed and if
not

229
00:14:28,260 --> 00:14:32,189
I'm often called on to flash out and
make it more a

230
00:14:32,190 --> 00:14:36,740
understandable thing on put it into the
form that you guys saw with the drawings

231
00:14:36,740 --> 00:14:38,550
the specification the claims

232
00:14:38,550 --> 00:14:42,680
and wash it off to you but alexandria
virginia

233
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:45,810
on once that happens a period of time
passes

234
00:14:45,810 --> 00:14:49,990
I and I kids usually a rejection

235
00:14:49,990 --> 00:14:53,829
because the patent office I'm and this
is probably contrary to your

236
00:14:53,829 --> 00:14:57,160
expectations the patent office is
actually pretty much biased

237
00:14:57,160 --> 00:15:00,819
toward rejection on it's very rare

238
00:15:00,820 --> 00:15:03,990
in the first case you get allowed claims
back

239
00:15:03,990 --> 00:15:07,120
because and I don't know

240
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:10,709
what the fundamental reason is I assume
it's because they're lazy

241
00:15:10,709 --> 00:15:14,980
on we have rejections that comes to me

242
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:18,440
I argue or I make an amendment changed
claims

243
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:23,010
I send it back this goes back and forth
until we either reach a resolution

244
00:15:23,010 --> 00:15:27,829
or we headed a roadblock and at that
point I have the option of

245
00:15:27,829 --> 00:15:31,980
appealing and going to an internal board

246
00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:35,260
above examiners who will review it on

247
00:15:35,260 --> 00:15:39,120
taking out of the pan exams and and then
if I disagree with them

248
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:44,209
I can take it up to the federal courts

249
00:15:44,209 --> 00:15:47,930
are

250
00:15:47,930 --> 00:15:51,430
on the question is what is the value
found a provisional patent it something

251
00:15:51,430 --> 00:15:53,250
I kind of skimmed over

252
00:15:53,250 --> 00:15:56,870
provisional patents on actually can you
say that to the end

253
00:15:56,870 --> 00:16:00,170
it's kinda admitted to move on and so

254
00:16:00,170 --> 00:16:03,779
this process is not a quick one and it's
certainly not a cheap one

255
00:16:03,779 --> 00:16:07,510
on you can expect it to last at least
two years

256
00:16:07,510 --> 00:16:12,170
if it's in a crowded technology are so
if you're dealing with something like

257
00:16:12,170 --> 00:16:15,839
image video compression or something
like that it could go for quite a bit

258
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:18,100
longer because they have a very large

259
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:21,959
backlog in applications

260
00:16:21,959 --> 00:16:26,300
so the way this goes eighty equals 0 you
file your application

261
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:30,199
roughly eighteen months later that
application becomes publish in this is

262
00:16:30,199 --> 00:16:31,899
something that's worth keeping in mind

263
00:16:31,899 --> 00:16:35,510
this entire process after the eighteen
months mark

264
00:16:35,510 --> 00:16:39,480
is public and so if you are following a
patent application

265
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:43,079
you have particular interest in you can
not only see

266
00:16:43,079 --> 00:16:46,430
the published application but you can
actually follow

267
00:16:46,430 --> 00:16:50,649
on the arguments made by both examiner
and the patent attorney

268
00:16:50,649 --> 00:16:55,779
you can download those in do whatever
you want with them I guess

269
00:16:55,779 --> 00:16:58,889
but but the point is that at the end of
the day

270
00:16:58,889 --> 00:17:02,760
you can sit down and figure out exactly
what transpired

271
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:06,079
and if somebody made a mistake

272
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:10,049
that becomes very relevant in litigation
scenario or if you're trying to

273
00:17:10,049 --> 00:17:11,929
invalidate that and for

274
00:17:11,929 --> 00:17:15,079
whatever righteous purposes you may have

275
00:17:15,079 --> 00:17:18,678
yep yes

276
00:17:18,679 --> 00:17:22,749
%uh at at the moment you file that
patent you get to Sac

277
00:17:22,749 --> 00:17:25,939
patent-pending on your invention or just

278
00:17:25,939 --> 00:17:32,100
declared to the world and that ends the
moment you abandon your application

279
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:36,619
I'll right to beach but as I described
before

280
00:17:36,619 --> 00:17:43,619
and get just a quick one please

281
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:50,310
well the question is how many patents
are published per day and how

282
00:17:50,310 --> 00:17:57,310
what's the volume in terms of pages oo
IC with the with the

283
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:02,150
the purposive love asking how hard is it
to keep track

284
00:18:02,150 --> 00:18:05,640
in a particular area up what is
happening out there

285
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:09,170
on the answer is probably very hard I

286
00:18:09,170 --> 00:18:12,990
well there are a lot of patents that
penned applications like it filed still

287
00:18:12,990 --> 00:18:14,070
extraordinary number

288
00:18:14,070 --> 00:18:17,270
on we just passed the eight millionth
patent

289
00:18:17,270 --> 00:18:20,889
issued patent on pretty recently

290
00:18:20,890 --> 00:18:24,150
I A couldn't tell you I mean it

291
00:18:24,150 --> 00:18:28,050
and it as it applies to your particular
yet as well

292
00:18:28,050 --> 00:18:31,919
as a whole list definitely mass message
price your particular technology

293
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:36,830
interest in like a much more limited I
don't know and I'm going to forge ahead

294
00:18:36,830 --> 00:18:37,560
here just

295
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:41,020
to get this site out of the way on the
median

296
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:45,490
and I look this up because patently
obvious blog has awesome statistics

297
00:18:45,490 --> 00:18:49,550
the median patent application pendency
is 34 years

298
00:18:49,550 --> 00:18:53,190
so that is about you can expect most

299
00:18:53,190 --> 00:18:56,470
them apparently are done by nine years
I'll

300
00:18:56,470 --> 00:19:00,620
I mean there are still some submarine
patents that are pending

301
00:19:00,620 --> 00:19:04,710
from back before 1995 and those could go
on for ever he has

302
00:19:04,710 --> 00:19:10,580
they got it in before the bar so going
to the question how broad a patent

303
00:19:10,580 --> 00:19:11,129
should be

304
00:19:11,130 --> 00:19:14,490
I am as as a patent lawyer people

305
00:19:14,490 --> 00:19:17,500
basically assume that my job is to get
the patent

306
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:21,900
on the thing that does its thing and
that's really not a valuable patent

307
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:25,450
because on the face in it it's invalid
right anybody can look at that

308
00:19:25,450 --> 00:19:29,400
even if I were to manage to trick the
patent examiner into allowing this

309
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:30,020
patent

310
00:19:30,020 --> 00:19:33,910
the only thing I would get out that is a
certain amount of pride

311
00:19:33,910 --> 00:19:37,800
I that would not be a useful pat it
would not be a valuable patent

312
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:41,780
because anybody could come in and knock
it out with trivially

313
00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:46,190
on and so having extremely broad patents
reason the call

314
00:19:46,190 --> 00:19:49,960
on any reasonable patent attorney whose
actually interested in protecting the

315
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:51,140
interest of his clients

316
00:19:51,140 --> 00:19:54,260
is going to say as luck

317
00:19:54,260 --> 00:19:58,490
this is too broad it's going to get
knocked out later I don't have apiece

318
00:19:58,490 --> 00:20:02,570
art that's going to show it but trust me
on this you wanna make it a reasonable

319
00:20:02,570 --> 00:20:03,200
SCO

320
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:06,710
and so the vast majority of pads fall
into that category

321
00:20:06,710 --> 00:20:09,990
their reasonable they cover what the by

322
00:20:09,990 --> 00:20:13,020
inventor actually was talking about on

323
00:20:13,020 --> 00:20:17,230
and stay you know this isn't a this is
it a system that fails

324
00:20:17,230 --> 00:20:21,620
sometimes but is not endemic it's not
endemic

325
00:20:21,620 --> 00:20:26,210
issue from my point of view um

326
00:20:26,210 --> 00:20:32,150
okay so this gonna continue on in that
the topic of how to get it and what you

327
00:20:32,150 --> 00:20:33,040
can expect

328
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:36,040
if you are filing a patent each
rejection each

329
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:39,500
office action they're called is going to
consist most likely other said

330
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:40,430
rejections

331
00:20:40,430 --> 00:20:44,550
and they're going to say claims 134 are
rejected on the grounds

332
00:20:44,550 --> 00:20:48,930
a obviousness claims 5 through 10

333
00:20:48,930 --> 00:20:52,570
are rejected because you can't spell
anything and they're going to break down

334
00:20:52,570 --> 00:20:55,389
like that so these are these are formal
rejections

335
00:20:55,390 --> 00:20:58,520
on and I'm just going to try these
numbers I don't really expect you to

336
00:20:58,520 --> 00:20:59,050
mean any

337
00:20:59,050 --> 00:21:03,169
that get them to mean anything to you
they're just there for the sake of

338
00:21:03,170 --> 00:21:07,920
disambiguation on section 112 is
directed to the clarity and

339
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:11,320
on usefulness at the specification their

340
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:15,379
certain formal requirements that go into
how you put together specification

341
00:21:15,380 --> 00:21:18,880
how you write your claims and you get a
rejection along that line

342
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:22,370
it might mean that the patents attorney

343
00:21:22,370 --> 00:21:27,080
that you hired isn't idiots it might
mean that the patent examiner is an

344
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:27,570
idiot

345
00:21:27,570 --> 00:21:31,230
on and didn't understand what you're
saying on

346
00:21:31,230 --> 00:21:35,970
or both pay there's more than enough
blame to go around

347
00:21:35,970 --> 00:21:39,440
on under 101 actually 101 is really the

348
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:43,060
part that I expect most if you'd be
interested in this is whether the

349
00:21:43,060 --> 00:21:44,320
subject matter

350
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:47,590
up the invention is provided for I am

351
00:21:47,590 --> 00:21:52,240
in it by statute and so the general said
if things is

352
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:55,540
I naked or an apparatus

353
00:21:55,540 --> 00:21:59,740
or a chemical composition there are
other a types of patents that

354
00:21:59,740 --> 00:22:02,820
extend into you know ornamental designs
in

355
00:22:02,820 --> 00:22:07,179
plants and things um but what really is
going to come down to

356
00:22:07,180 --> 00:22:10,480
the contention here is software patents
I imagine

357
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:14,470
on which come down to be Bilski decision

358
00:22:14,470 --> 00:22:19,430
I unfortunately at the the bad news I
have to give you is that the Bilski

359
00:22:19,430 --> 00:22:21,500
decision did not make patents

360
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:24,560
suffer patents invalid on

361
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:28,399
it basically just set up a

362
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:31,640
formalistic requirement a.m. a

363
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:35,940
how to deal with with software patents
on

364
00:22:35,940 --> 00:22:40,440
that those decisions came down and said
I

365
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:43,850
we like this whole must include a
transformation more

366
00:22:43,850 --> 00:22:47,970
a piece of hardware idea that the
Federal Circuit came up with

367
00:22:47,970 --> 00:22:51,550
but it really doesn't fit with anything
we've done before and that's really how

368
00:22:51,550 --> 00:22:55,190
the dialogue between the Federal Circuit
and the supreme court usually goes

369
00:22:55,190 --> 00:22:58,280
is the Federal Circuit tries to come up
with a clever solution

370
00:22:58,280 --> 00:23:01,670
and the supreme court tells them no in
very strong language

371
00:23:01,670 --> 00:23:04,880
I'm this was actually the decision was
actually much more pleasant than they

372
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:05,780
usually are

373
00:23:05,780 --> 00:23:08,840
I'll but what they came down and said is

374
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:11,990
our jurisprudence says that

375
00:23:11,990 --> 00:23:16,070
abstract ideas are not patentable
searched kinda stick to that

376
00:23:16,070 --> 00:23:19,740
they didn't provide any real on

377
00:23:19,740 --> 00:23:24,060
explanation for an abstract idea is and
is not

378
00:23:24,060 --> 00:23:28,020
and so the way this is still getting
interpreted at the patent office

379
00:23:28,020 --> 00:23:31,860
is that you need to tie in some piece of
hardware or you need to have a really

380
00:23:31,860 --> 00:23:32,140
good

381
00:23:32,140 --> 00:23:35,160
argument which I've never seen for

382
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:40,610
4y a peace appear software is not an
abstract idea

383
00:23:40,610 --> 00:23:44,870
but what we do is we say we find the
most important step

384
00:23:44,870 --> 00:23:49,370
and we say oh yeah how was done by a
processor and the patent examiner accept

385
00:23:49,370 --> 00:23:50,710
that ands

386
00:23:50,710 --> 00:23:53,850
we getting a lap at

387
00:23:53,850 --> 00:23:59,990
yes

388
00:23:59,990 --> 00:24:04,020
the question is how how specific how
specific is that processor and it is

389
00:24:04,020 --> 00:24:04,879
literally just

390
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:08,850
a processor had some patent examiners
come back and say

391
00:24:08,850 --> 00:24:13,340
will that could be a word processor
which I responded with no it couldn't

392
00:24:13,340 --> 00:24:19,889
and that was the end of that yeah

393
00:24:19,890 --> 00:24:25,540
I'm not sure what you mean

394
00:24:25,540 --> 00:24:28,870
it's still going to be running on a
processor presumably

395
00:24:28,870 --> 00:24:33,180
caress I mean unless you have a virtual
machine in your head I think

396
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:35,820
ultimately every virtual machine is
going to come down to a piece of

397
00:24:35,820 --> 00:24:39,189
hardware

398
00:24:39,190 --> 00:24:43,340
its is you know it's just that at some
point this step is being performed by a

399
00:24:43,340 --> 00:24:44,110
processor

400
00:24:44,110 --> 00:24:47,960
even if the processor is a pretend
processor in the imagination of another

401
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:49,020
processor

402
00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:52,710
at some point there's a processor that's
doing the process

403
00:24:52,710 --> 00:24:58,980
yes

404
00:24:58,980 --> 00:25:02,040
you're getting it yet the question is
whether all software is

405
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:06,129
actually running on a processor and the
answer is yes and that's why Bilski

406
00:25:06,130 --> 00:25:09,860
doesn't actually as long as we are
allowed to do this

407
00:25:09,860 --> 00:25:14,760
Bilski doesn't actually prevent us from
claiming software patents

408
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:17,990
on she think

409
00:25:17,990 --> 00:25:21,510
Bilski was last year

410
00:25:21,510 --> 00:25:24,660
on their got a couple more decisions
sense then I

411
00:25:24,660 --> 00:25:27,700
including on for me

412
00:25:27,700 --> 00:25:31,330
pS Thank You which is a a more
biological patent but does get to the

413
00:25:31,330 --> 00:25:32,409
topic

414
00:25:32,410 --> 00:25:35,970
%uh of on abstract ideas in

415
00:25:35,970 --> 00:25:39,670
they sat on it better up but all that's
really done it has made the Federal

416
00:25:39,670 --> 00:25:41,020
Circuit scratches head

417
00:25:41,020 --> 00:25:45,350
really hard II came prepared actually
have a quote from the most recent

418
00:25:45,350 --> 00:25:46,870
decision on this topic

419
00:25:46,870 --> 00:25:51,680
a from the 9th July in CLS purses hours
Corp

420
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:55,260
this Court holds that when after taking
all of the claim

421
00:25:55,260 --> 00:26:00,370
recitations into consideration it is not
manifest week evident

422
00:26:00,370 --> 00:26:04,580
they claim is directed to a patent
ineligible abstract idea

423
00:26:04,580 --> 00:26:08,480
that patent must not be deemed for that
reason to be inadequate on

424
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:12,410
101 unless the single most reasonable
understanding

425
00:26:12,410 --> 00:26:15,640
is that a claim is directed to nothing
more than a fundamental truth

426
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:19,540
or disembodied concept with no
limitations in the claim attaching the

427
00:26:19,540 --> 00:26:21,780
idea to specific application

428
00:26:21,780 --> 00:26:24,840
it is inappropriate to hold that the
claim is directed to a patent

429
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:28,400
ineligible abstract idea on so the pan

430
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:32,200
and there's there's conflicting case
wall right now up from the Federal

431
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:33,400
Circuit that had

432
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:36,890
that that decision had a very strong
dissent and so the

433
00:26:36,890 --> 00:26:40,980
on end result is we're just gonna keep
doing that

434
00:26:40,980 --> 00:26:47,980
until somebody figures out about iraq
hand in the back at

435
00:26:51,780 --> 00:26:55,460
the question is whether there is a
limitations that were can you attach

436
00:26:55,460 --> 00:26:59,760
on computers to any sentence the answer
is that you can't actually say

437
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:03,570
this is done on a computer and have it
work you have to say something like

438
00:27:03,570 --> 00:27:08,450
this is done by a processor

439
00:27:08,450 --> 00:27:14,060
yes

440
00:27:14,060 --> 00:27:17,899
the question is what about business
methods the answer is

441
00:27:17,900 --> 00:27:23,260
a as long as they are not an abstract
idea

442
00:27:23,260 --> 00:27:28,090
they are okay on and I just read the
stat that the current standard as a july

443
00:27:28,090 --> 00:27:29,090
9th

444
00:27:29,090 --> 00:27:33,210
um for how the Federal Circuit is
determining what an abstract idea is

445
00:27:33,210 --> 00:27:38,590
which is that unless it's pretty clearly
stated this is an abstract idea

446
00:27:38,590 --> 00:27:43,470
we're going to let it go um with any
other questions about that

447
00:27:43,470 --> 00:27:46,720
great and I have

448
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:49,950
lost focus here we go

449
00:27:49,950 --> 00:27:54,460
ok as this gets back to what I was
saying earlier about

450
00:27:54,460 --> 00:28:01,460
on

451
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:04,970
a dirty talk hey wow I did go back lace

452
00:28:04,970 --> 00:28:08,400
okay thank you on

453
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:11,710
so in addition to those followers
actions ninety consider Bilski to be a

454
00:28:11,710 --> 00:28:12,680
formal written back

455
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:15,680
bills he issues to be a formal issue
because the only

456
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:19,370
realz solution to it is changing the
language to include

457
00:28:19,370 --> 00:28:23,540
a processor on there are substantive
rejections

458
00:28:23,540 --> 00:28:26,840
and these really get into the

459
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:31,030
the stuff that you think about a lot in
terms of this has been done before

460
00:28:31,030 --> 00:28:34,889
or hasn't been done before it would have
been obvious to do it before

461
00:28:34,890 --> 00:28:37,980
those are sections 102 and 103
respectively

462
00:28:37,980 --> 00:28:42,990
um what the the way this works is the
pan examiner comes in with specific

463
00:28:42,990 --> 00:28:44,050
references

464
00:28:44,050 --> 00:28:47,460
they've gone out and they've done a
search they've generally speaking

465
00:28:47,460 --> 00:28:51,530
only looked at actual patents and patent
applications to determine what has been

466
00:28:51,530 --> 00:28:52,690
done before

467
00:28:52,690 --> 00:28:58,050
on sometimes if it's a particularly
ambitious examiners they'll use Google

468
00:28:58,050 --> 00:29:01,510
I and they just kinda

469
00:29:01,510 --> 00:29:05,980
the the they find a way to applies
something like this to all your claims

470
00:29:05,980 --> 00:29:10,010
and give you that first rejection and
then again it's the penetration job

471
00:29:10,010 --> 00:29:13,010
to either overcome that by argument by
saying look

472
00:29:13,010 --> 00:29:16,800
this really doesn't teach what you think
it teaches or

473
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:20,010
you didn't understand what I said or

474
00:29:20,010 --> 00:29:24,090
changing everything said that the
examiner has to go back and start over

475
00:29:24,090 --> 00:29:29,680
yes an actual gonna get into obvious is
it a bit more detail so hopefully

476
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:31,700
that'll answer your

477
00:29:31,700 --> 00:29:37,230
questions on when I talk about how to
beat a patent

478
00:29:37,230 --> 00:29:40,310
on so all this process costs money

479
00:29:40,310 --> 00:29:44,240
it's not cheap to get a patent on

480
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:48,180
you can read up there filing application
costs 1250

481
00:29:48,180 --> 00:29:51,500
a getting that patents on

482
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:54,630
I'll issued after its been allowed that
that is to say after you've convinced

483
00:29:54,630 --> 00:29:57,380
the examiner cost you another 2,000

484
00:29:57,380 --> 00:30:00,880
on there are there is a 50 percent
discount if you are small

485
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:04,580
entity however so if you're a start-up
if you basically if you

486
00:30:04,580 --> 00:30:07,909
belong to an entity that is less than
500 people

487
00:30:07,910 --> 00:30:11,010
you get that 50 percent discount and
someday

488
00:30:11,010 --> 00:30:14,160
they're going to institute what's called
a micro entity discount which is a

489
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:15,880
seventy-five percent discount

490
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:19,790
they just haven't done it yet and then
you can get the full fee schedule there

491
00:30:19,790 --> 00:30:23,930
there are a lot of fees on

492
00:30:23,930 --> 00:30:27,310
never going to get into now now that
you've got this patent and now that many

493
00:30:27,310 --> 00:30:29,800
other people have their pants how can
you knock those patents

494
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:34,370
out of the water so that they're not a
threat to you and those you love

495
00:30:34,370 --> 00:30:38,460
on as a nm as we all know

496
00:30:38,460 --> 00:30:41,560
but patents are big deal when they're
used against you

497
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:45,520
on if you´re in a startup or some kinda
small endeavor

498
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:49,420
a patent lawsuit can sync you the even
if you win

499
00:30:49,420 --> 00:30:53,510
the attorneys fees I for actually wanna
jump right back

500
00:30:53,510 --> 00:30:57,670
here attorney's fees are also is very
relevant consideration and are several

501
00:30:57,670 --> 00:30:59,780
times to bear filing fees

502
00:30:59,780 --> 00:31:03,290
at best if you get a fancy manhattan
firm

503
00:31:03,290 --> 00:31:08,760
you're looking at over ten thousand
dollars just to prepare that application

504
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:12,340
on attorney's fees for a patent
litigation

505
00:31:12,340 --> 00:31:16,380
the standard quote is a million dollars
I N

506
00:31:16,380 --> 00:31:20,090
if if it goes all the way to try out
that is how much will be out of pocket

507
00:31:20,090 --> 00:31:25,420
I YES on either side because either side
is going to have to do

508
00:31:25,420 --> 00:31:29,030
discovery it's going have to get their
own respective experts and is going to

509
00:31:29,030 --> 00:31:29,950
have to pay their

510
00:31:29,950 --> 00:31:34,670
attorneys hazard hazard pay to go to
trial

511
00:31:34,670 --> 00:31:38,890
I yeah it's basically comes down to you
get a premium for going to trial

512
00:31:38,890 --> 00:31:42,070
on so

513
00:31:42,070 --> 00:31:45,110
let's say you're stuck in this situation
obviously the best way

514
00:31:45,110 --> 00:31:48,160
not to get stuck in this situation is
not to infringe

515
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:51,900
but as we all know that's not always an
option or not always something that you

516
00:31:51,900 --> 00:31:53,890
realize is about to happen

517
00:31:53,890 --> 00:31:57,520
so you are now in litigation scenario or

518
00:31:57,520 --> 00:32:00,879
are you believe you may be about to be
in litigation scenario and you have to

519
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:01,790
figure out how to get

520
00:32:01,790 --> 00:32:07,110
out if this on the best tactic is to
show both that you don't infringe

521
00:32:07,110 --> 00:32:11,030
and that the other guy never should have
had that patent in the first place

522
00:32:11,030 --> 00:32:14,230
on beating the pants is basically the
reverse

523
00:32:14,230 --> 00:32:17,530
getting a patent instead of sitting in
the position of the inventor now you're

524
00:32:17,530 --> 00:32:18,480
sitting in the position

525
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:22,110
up the examiner and you're going to take
that document

526
00:32:22,110 --> 00:32:26,410
and try and find a way using one of
those rejections I stated earlier

527
00:32:26,410 --> 00:32:29,900
why these patent should be invalid on

528
00:32:29,900 --> 00:32:32,980
unfortunately for the person in that

529
00:32:32,980 --> 00:32:37,170
position and I'm not a litigation
litigators I don't particularly care

530
00:32:37,170 --> 00:32:40,760
I unfortunately the standard

531
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:44,070
evidence for proving that is clear and
convincing

532
00:32:44,070 --> 00:32:47,570
which in we'll speak means really hard I
am

533
00:32:47,570 --> 00:32:50,840
you have to show well beyond

534
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:54,890
like a 50 percent chance that examiner
was wrong

535
00:32:54,890 --> 00:32:59,190
that means you have to find all-new art
that was not considered generally

536
00:32:59,190 --> 00:33:02,290
you have to have really airtight
arguments and it's just

537
00:33:02,290 --> 00:33:06,379
generally unpleasant experience which in
part makes

538
00:33:06,380 --> 00:33:11,390
patent litigation once you have pants a
very attractive

539
00:33:11,390 --> 00:33:15,000
proposal and it's what makes shaking
people down very possible

540
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:19,490
cuz it's hard to invalidate patents as a
even if you have

541
00:33:19,490 --> 00:33:26,490
kinda weak argument if you have a
patents you're in a good position

542
00:33:27,260 --> 00:33:31,370
so how this works is this this all
happens in federal court

543
00:33:31,370 --> 00:33:34,840
they can see you in federal district
court for infringement

544
00:33:34,840 --> 00:33:38,070
I just talked about the presumption of
validity

545
00:33:38,070 --> 00:33:41,669
ands but I covered this entire site
already

546
00:33:41,670 --> 00:33:45,490
the you can use basically any trick in
your bag to try and knock out

547
00:33:45,490 --> 00:33:51,720
as long as you are really really good at
it yes

548
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:54,730
other stuff

549
00:33:54,730 --> 00:33:59,120
I city event as your question frankly I
don't know because it never comes up

550
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:02,800
on there are things there are things in
their relating to

551
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:06,320
you know jurisdictional issues how this
sue

552
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:09,659
on stuff like that these are the
sections that come up on a day-to-day

553
00:34:09,659 --> 00:34:10,889
basis in terms of

554
00:34:10,889 --> 00:34:15,259
the validity of the patent on said
getting into the nitty gritty of how to

555
00:34:15,260 --> 00:34:16,690
knock a patent out

556
00:34:16,690 --> 00:34:20,260
we'll start with 102 which is a.m.

557
00:34:20,260 --> 00:34:23,980
basically somebody did this before
everyman every element

558
00:34:23,980 --> 00:34:27,050
in your claim has been shown in the
prior art

559
00:34:27,050 --> 00:34:31,810
and that were prior art is a very
particular word

560
00:34:31,810 --> 00:34:35,239
on not everything that happened before
you was prior

561
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:39,730
are not everything that other people
have done that was similar is prior art

562
00:34:39,730 --> 00:34:44,190
on but what comes to what it generally
defines prior art reference

563
00:34:44,190 --> 00:34:47,880
is some document I or or an invention

564
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:52,730
or something that was done or published
by somebody

565
00:34:52,730 --> 00:34:57,700
in specific places I'm so it can be the
invention was no use by others

566
00:34:57,700 --> 00:35:01,750
in the US or published anywhere so
somebody

567
00:35:01,750 --> 00:35:06,080
major invention and Swaziland and didn't
publish it

568
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:09,420
that's okay for US Pat um

569
00:35:09,420 --> 00:35:12,910
but it was published anywhere then
you're in trouble and publication I'm

570
00:35:12,910 --> 00:35:13,859
actually getting

571
00:35:13,859 --> 00:35:17,620
define a bit better publication

572
00:35:17,620 --> 00:35:20,819
is a very broad term a a thing is
publishing

573
00:35:20,820 --> 00:35:24,410
considered published if it's just like
somebody's thesis that was

574
00:35:24,410 --> 00:35:28,000
up printed out and put into their
University's library

575
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:32,480
somewhere at some point on which raises
the question of how anybody ever finds

576
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:32,970
it

577
00:35:32,970 --> 00:35:37,210
but it's still consider it if that
happens it's considered to be prior art

578
00:35:37,210 --> 00:35:41,750
on and then you also have this
possibility of what's called secret par

579
00:35:41,750 --> 00:35:46,230
prior art because there's a lag time
between patent application and patent

580
00:35:46,230 --> 00:35:48,560
publication 18 months

581
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:52,049
things that were filed before you file

582
00:35:52,050 --> 00:35:58,200
but published after he filed are still
held against you

583
00:35:58,200 --> 00:36:02,950
sorry talked about what he publication
is on if you yourself

584
00:36:02,950 --> 00:36:06,870
publish something you have that you have
a one-year grace period

585
00:36:06,870 --> 00:36:10,029
in which your own publications aren't
held against you

586
00:36:10,030 --> 00:36:13,830
on after which it doesn't matter whether
you wrote it whether

587
00:36:13,830 --> 00:36:17,490
you know your mother wrote it its its

588
00:36:17,490 --> 00:36:21,530
but considered to be prior art and the
neck gets into what's your prior to

589
00:36:21,530 --> 00:36:22,210
submit their

590
00:36:22,210 --> 00:36:26,500
on anticipation is a very I easy thing
to deal with

591
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:29,810
its site could serve a one to one
correspondence everything in your claim

592
00:36:29,810 --> 00:36:31,230
is in this document

593
00:36:31,230 --> 00:36:34,700
and a story obviousness is a much
trickier issue

594
00:36:34,700 --> 00:36:40,100
on it's not the way you think of the
word obvious

595
00:36:40,100 --> 00:36:43,359
obvious for us means

596
00:36:43,359 --> 00:36:47,140
every element was ins some reference

597
00:36:47,140 --> 00:36:50,310
and we can find some connection between
those references

598
00:36:50,310 --> 00:36:53,330
generally speaking that means that the
references were part love

599
00:36:53,330 --> 00:36:56,730
a similar field art so if they were both
you know

600
00:36:56,730 --> 00:36:59,840
a encryption papers that were published

601
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:04,170
an SL you did half this these guys cover
most if your idea except for this one

602
00:37:04,170 --> 00:37:07,910
it a little bit that this guy did over
here and so it's been obvious

603
00:37:07,910 --> 00:37:10,970
to use that Italy day with this guy's

604
00:37:10,970 --> 00:37:15,390
encryption to make your thing obvious on

605
00:37:15,390 --> 00:37:19,020
its day what counts as an alga art

606
00:37:19,020 --> 00:37:23,320
and what counts as reasonably pertinent
such that somebody would have considered

607
00:37:23,320 --> 00:37:24,340
it obvious is

608
00:37:24,340 --> 00:37:28,010
delia tough I think define

609
00:37:28,010 --> 00:37:32,250
and goes back to me arguing with the
examiner on

610
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:35,530
generally speaking the goal

611
00:37:35,530 --> 00:37:39,810
here in terms of knocking down the
patent is to say

612
00:37:39,810 --> 00:37:43,100
clearly these were analogous whereas my
job is to say

613
00:37:43,100 --> 00:37:46,560
clearly the smart analogous on

614
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:50,130
says results that you know people have a

615
00:37:50,130 --> 00:37:54,380
kinda vague idea up what it means for an
invention to be obvious

616
00:37:54,380 --> 00:37:59,040
on and this is really where that clear
and convincing standard

617
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:03,259
gets thorny if you have one reference
that really shows everything

618
00:38:03,260 --> 00:38:06,290
your job is done if you have to prove it
it was

619
00:38:06,290 --> 00:38:09,350
obvious it becomes much more difficult

620
00:38:09,350 --> 00:38:12,910
on that's all I really have to say about
that it's

621
00:38:12,910 --> 00:38:17,450
its unpleasant that thing to deal with
for everybody involved

622
00:38:17,450 --> 00:38:20,620
now all of this is about to change I am

623
00:38:20,620 --> 00:38:24,230
where like I said last september
congress

624
00:38:24,230 --> 00:38:28,410
issued a Reform Act which greatly
simplifies what goes into being prior

625
00:38:28,410 --> 00:38:28,890
art

626
00:38:28,890 --> 00:38:32,730
hot and that's that's the quote that is
what prior art is the claimed invention

627
00:38:32,730 --> 00:38:33,859
was patented

628
00:38:33,859 --> 00:38:37,290
described in a print publication or in
public use on sale or otherwise

629
00:38:37,290 --> 00:38:39,320
available to the public

630
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:43,170
before the effective filing date of the
claimed invention on

631
00:38:43,170 --> 00:38:46,300
and there is still a there's still a
grace period

632
00:38:46,300 --> 00:38:50,450
where your own in and your own
publications

633
00:38:50,450 --> 00:38:54,350
don't count it against you in anything
after your initial disclosure

634
00:38:54,350 --> 00:38:57,930
don't count against you for one year

635
00:38:57,930 --> 00:39:02,299
on I have very little intuitive idea for
how that's going to play out yet just

636
00:39:02,300 --> 00:39:02,960
because

637
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:06,810
asked I which

638
00:39:06,810 --> 00:39:09,859
idoney oh yeah and there are certain
extradition on

639
00:39:09,859 --> 00:39:13,580
that extra-judicial ways a challenging
patent

640
00:39:13,580 --> 00:39:17,700
on this happen outside of the federal
court system

641
00:39:17,700 --> 00:39:21,580
on basically it means going to deep and
office

642
00:39:21,580 --> 00:39:24,880
instead at the federal courts and making
the same kind arguments

643
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:27,910
the advantages that the standard love

644
00:39:27,910 --> 00:39:31,290
proof is a lower so it's easier to deal
with

645
00:39:31,290 --> 00:39:35,520
on but generally speaking there

646
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:40,290
Extreme Rules involved for example in
the in the court system you could make a

647
00:39:40,290 --> 00:39:43,029
112 argument you can see these claims
are clear

648
00:39:43,030 --> 00:39:47,240
nobody knows what this guy is talking
about therefore the patent is invalid

649
00:39:47,240 --> 00:39:51,560
you can't do that and a reexamination
three examination is only done by

650
00:39:51,560 --> 00:39:57,779
prior art references on and of course
all this is changing as well

651
00:39:57,780 --> 00:40:00,900
on beginning on in September

652
00:40:00,900 --> 00:40:03,980
there's going to be called something
called inter partes review

653
00:40:03,980 --> 00:40:06,980
which is where it's basically a little
litigation

654
00:40:06,980 --> 00:40:11,040
except it's happening at the patent
office to it stands right now is

655
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:15,930
on reexamination I has an ex parte a
option

656
00:40:15,930 --> 00:40:19,060
I which is sort of fire and forget to
put together a bundle you send it to the

657
00:40:19,060 --> 00:40:19,770
patent office

658
00:40:19,770 --> 00:40:23,000
in a deal with it there is an inter
partes option that's getting

659
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:26,310
tweaked in September but the general

660
00:40:26,310 --> 00:40:29,920
idea is that you now get you argue
directly

661
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:33,900
for why this should be invalid

662
00:40:33,900 --> 00:40:37,350
and then finally we have post-grant
review I

663
00:40:37,350 --> 00:40:40,560
which is entirely new but

664
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:44,420
the idea being on you have a period of
nine months

665
00:40:44,420 --> 00:40:47,470
after the application is actually issued

666
00:40:47,470 --> 00:40:51,750
I which really when most people are
acting going to notice

667
00:40:51,750 --> 00:40:56,080
you know on after win this when this
happens you have nine months to start to

668
00:40:56,080 --> 00:40:58,240
put post-grant review process

669
00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:01,930
on you can use any grounds rejection you
know one

670
00:41:01,930 --> 00:41:04,960
112 101 whatever on

671
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:08,440
and the thing about these extra-judicial

672
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:11,680
reviews is that they're extremely
expensive

673
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:15,790
and when I say that I mean tens of
thousands of dollars just to file

674
00:41:15,790 --> 00:41:19,810
the petition for review

675
00:41:19,810 --> 00:41:23,150
has how you kill a patent and that's how
you get a patent and that's how you read

676
00:41:23,150 --> 00:41:23,910
a patent

677
00:41:23,910 --> 00:41:27,060
are there any questions

678
00:41:27,060 --> 00:41:34,060
yes you in the orange

679
00:42:09,210 --> 00:42:10,739
so the question is

680
00:42:10,739 --> 00:42:14,140
from somebody who is asked to review a
patent his

681
00:42:14,140 --> 00:42:17,319
employer was thinking a infringing

682
00:42:17,319 --> 00:42:22,089
um and how he had found several

683
00:42:22,089 --> 00:42:26,549
by references that he believes I knocked
it out in his

684
00:42:26,549 --> 00:42:31,210
non legal opinion that all of these
elements were covered in a previous

685
00:42:31,210 --> 00:42:34,319
in one or more previous references on

686
00:42:34,319 --> 00:42:37,819
and his employer chose not to pursue its
despite that

687
00:42:37,819 --> 00:42:41,259
and the question then is whether they
would have been okay

688
00:42:41,259 --> 00:42:45,779
I guess okay

689
00:42:45,779 --> 00:42:52,779
I will give me a hypothetical I can
answer

690
00:42:53,180 --> 00:42:57,669
it okay

691
00:42:57,670 --> 00:43:02,319
on the answer is it to the surprise
question of whether you would have been

692
00:43:02,319 --> 00:43:02,989
okay

693
00:43:02,989 --> 00:43:07,599
is I don't know I generally speaking
when you're in that position

694
00:43:07,599 --> 00:43:11,230
you don't ask an engineer to figure it
out you asked the lawyer to figure it

695
00:43:11,230 --> 00:43:11,539
out

696
00:43:11,539 --> 00:43:14,640
because then hand is not active shut up

697
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:18,970
because the lawyer is going to put their
you know is trained in S&A

698
00:43:18,970 --> 00:43:23,960
they deal with this a lot and day
basically put their credibility and

699
00:43:23,960 --> 00:43:25,630
reliability on the line

700
00:43:25,630 --> 00:43:29,180
if you get burnt I which is why you do
that

701
00:43:29,180 --> 00:43:35,799
at that said even if you know it's it's
not necessarily a crazy thing

702
00:43:35,799 --> 00:43:39,559
that they chose not to infringe it
assuming it worked

703
00:43:39,559 --> 00:43:44,049
um that they chose not to infringe it
because the potential costs

704
00:43:44,049 --> 00:43:47,970
up having that argument with the other
side can be enormous

705
00:43:47,970 --> 00:43:52,230
on yes can he said again

706
00:43:52,230 --> 00:43:59,230
ran oh you mean in a in a

707
00:44:03,170 --> 00:44:07,220
sort of forced some licensing situation
or I can

708
00:44:07,220 --> 00:44:14,220
indication sometimes people I am NOT I'm
not personally too familiar with that I

709
00:44:20,859 --> 00:44:22,078
guess I'm not a litigator

710
00:44:22,079 --> 00:44:26,180
on what often happens is people are
forced

711
00:44:26,180 --> 00:44:29,460
to a lot and this actually happens a lot
in terms of

712
00:44:29,460 --> 00:44:33,180
non-practicing entities which some may
know better as trolls

713
00:44:33,180 --> 00:44:36,779
on in those situations

714
00:44:36,779 --> 00:44:40,609
a an entity can be forced to accept it
royalty

715
00:44:40,609 --> 00:44:44,420
on because if's you aren't practicing it
yourself

716
00:44:44,420 --> 00:44:48,099
and you are trying to prevent other
people from practicing at

717
00:44:48,099 --> 00:44:51,950
that's kinda agence I don't know public
policy

718
00:44:51,950 --> 00:44:56,069
I've really never heard that acronym
before friend

719
00:44:56,069 --> 00:44:59,989
I i understand I understand I just never
heard it

720
00:44:59,989 --> 00:45:05,339
okay

721
00:45:05,339 --> 00:45:08,690
I have heard about a thing yet okay

722
00:45:08,690 --> 00:45:12,839
I

723
00:45:12,839 --> 00:45:19,839
right was this the post your case

724
00:45:35,269 --> 00:45:41,069
that the poster wrote happened very
recently posers crazy

725
00:45:41,069 --> 00:45:45,480
on yeah I'm sorry I don't have a good
answer for you

726
00:45:45,480 --> 00:45:52,309
on yes old on this ride some BS

727
00:45:52,309 --> 00:45:56,279
this channel nast a what the purpose
have a provisional patent is

728
00:45:56,279 --> 00:46:00,279
it's basically a placeholder you get
about um you get a year

729
00:46:00,279 --> 00:46:03,950
from the filing of your provisional
patent I am

730
00:46:03,950 --> 00:46:08,460
until you have to file your full
application and you get the benefit

731
00:46:08,460 --> 00:46:13,289
%uh that Provisionals filing date: in
terms of what counts as prior art

732
00:46:13,289 --> 00:46:17,539
and your cap your your clock for the
lifetime and Pat starts when you file

733
00:46:17,539 --> 00:46:18,730
the full application

734
00:46:18,730 --> 00:46:22,079
she's me the problem with the
provisional is they're not particularly

735
00:46:22,079 --> 00:46:23,460
useful

736
00:46:23,460 --> 00:46:26,480
and they don't really see if you any
money on

737
00:46:26,480 --> 00:46:29,710
people kind of want to do provisional so
that they can just get something in the

738
00:46:29,710 --> 00:46:30,489
door

739
00:46:30,489 --> 00:46:34,819
and then go get funding for it but in
terms of the amount of work that's

740
00:46:34,819 --> 00:46:35,499
required

741
00:46:35,499 --> 00:46:39,430
generate a good provisional that'll hold
you in good stead down the line

742
00:46:39,430 --> 00:46:43,249
on you're going to be paying roughly the
same

743
00:46:43,249 --> 00:46:47,779
to to a patent attorney to do that so I
I generally don't personally

744
00:46:47,779 --> 00:46:52,900
recommend that people do Provisionals

745
00:46:52,900 --> 00:46:56,400
it's the sort of situation where I if
you're worried that people are going to

746
00:46:56,400 --> 00:46:57,950
you

747
00:46:57,950 --> 00:47:00,960
do something with this right away and
you need to get you know

748
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:04,650
block of any possible prior art that you
know in that sort of situation

749
00:47:04,650 --> 00:47:08,150
staff together what you've got filed a
provisional and you hope

750
00:47:08,150 --> 00:47:15,150
on guess

751
00:47:21,820 --> 00:47:24,060
its difficult I am

752
00:47:24,060 --> 00:47:27,880
I feel like I could go do it for myself
I

753
00:47:27,880 --> 00:47:31,300
yeah it's not an easy process

754
00:47:31,300 --> 00:47:35,280
there is you know they're there's a
little bit you can do as an individual

755
00:47:35,280 --> 00:47:38,349
to figure out the system a little bit
better and to

756
00:47:38,349 --> 00:47:41,730
negotiate the prosecution process a
little bit better

757
00:47:41,730 --> 00:47:44,619
I'm one of the tools you can use as you
can actually pick up the phone and talk

758
00:47:44,619 --> 00:47:46,910
to the patent examiner who issued your
rejection

759
00:47:46,910 --> 00:47:51,170
and if you don't understand something
you can ask them to explain it on

760
00:47:51,170 --> 00:47:54,270
sometimes they're difficult to
understand I mean

761
00:47:54,270 --> 00:47:58,070
examiners themselves on and sometimes
they don't really know

762
00:47:58,070 --> 00:48:03,349
what's going on so you know it does help
if you have somebody

763
00:48:03,349 --> 00:48:06,680
knows what's going on in can fill them
in on

764
00:48:06,680 --> 00:48:11,259
but generally it's going to be hard but
not impossible I

765
00:48:11,260 --> 00:48:18,260
sky

766
00:48:23,370 --> 00:48:26,190
I mean they could just said if you're
picking up the phone and talking to a

767
00:48:26,190 --> 00:48:27,210
patent examiner

768
00:48:27,210 --> 00:48:30,300
they will try and help you know they
will explain it to you as long as you're

769
00:48:30,300 --> 00:48:30,760
polite

770
00:48:30,760 --> 00:48:33,310
you know if you're not a jerk to them
they're not gonna be a jerk to you

771
00:48:33,310 --> 00:48:33,980
they're just

772
00:48:33,980 --> 00:48:39,320
federal employees doing their job on if
you have questions about procedure and

773
00:48:39,320 --> 00:48:39,700
how

774
00:48:39,700 --> 00:48:43,330
you know the nuts and bolts a filing a
thing work on yeah you can talk to

775
00:48:43,330 --> 00:48:46,190
anyone in the technology centers and
I'll explain everything to you and

776
00:48:46,190 --> 00:48:49,840
II I don't personally know the numbers
to call for that

777
00:48:49,840 --> 00:48:54,670
but it's presumably somewhere on their
website I

778
00:48:54,670 --> 00:48:58,020
okay I'm gonna keep working back
somebody back there

779
00:48:58,020 --> 00:49:04,120
arrest and mister in the red submarine
patents yes

780
00:49:04,120 --> 00:49:09,220
is their list of submarine pans out
there

781
00:49:09,220 --> 00:49:16,220
on I don't know I mean

782
00:49:22,470 --> 00:49:25,430
try and pay somebody into using their
summary hand against you

783
00:49:25,430 --> 00:49:31,348
on maybe I the question is whether
there's a list of submarine patents

784
00:49:31,349 --> 00:49:36,890
out there that we could then use to
scare the submarine patent holders

785
00:49:36,890 --> 00:49:40,180
out of hiding um I don't know

786
00:49:40,180 --> 00:49:43,430
part presumably if their public you can
go find them

787
00:49:43,430 --> 00:49:47,348
they would be the ones that have been
pending since before 1995

788
00:49:47,349 --> 00:49:54,349
on by the column yes

789
00:50:10,980 --> 00:50:13,930
okay the question is in

790
00:50:13,930 --> 00:50:17,470
is secret prior art available to the
patent examiner

791
00:50:17,470 --> 00:50:20,549
be for its publish

792
00:50:20,549 --> 00:50:24,930
the answer is in practical terms it
would never really come up

793
00:50:24,930 --> 00:50:29,750
because lag time between filing and
receiving your first Office Action

794
00:50:29,750 --> 00:50:33,789
can be a you know is generally on the
order of two years so that exceeds the

795
00:50:33,789 --> 00:50:36,809
publication day which means by the time
an exam for actually sits down to do the

796
00:50:36,809 --> 00:50:37,329
search

797
00:50:37,329 --> 00:50:44,329
although that secret prior art has
already been fleshed out exactly

798
00:50:48,069 --> 00:50:51,710
its it's an issue up if you are if
you're trying to do the right thing

799
00:50:51,710 --> 00:50:54,769
and find all of that all the potentially

800
00:50:54,769 --> 00:50:58,690
trouble some stuff out there you might
not find all of it because it's

801
00:50:58,690 --> 00:51:05,690
secret on yes in the back

802
00:51:39,030 --> 00:51:43,410
the option and again this is coming from
a relatively biased perspective the

803
00:51:43,410 --> 00:51:44,399
option the

804
00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:47,740
the best course of action if you have
the money to do it is usually not don't

805
00:51:47,740 --> 00:51:48,690
get patents

806
00:51:48,690 --> 00:51:52,340
that's that's not going to be a good
course of action in terms of your

807
00:51:52,340 --> 00:51:53,420
strategic position

808
00:51:53,420 --> 00:51:57,520
um usually I mean my point of view is
that

809
00:51:57,520 --> 00:52:01,230
a patent is an asset for your startup
and

810
00:52:01,230 --> 00:52:04,630
even if you don't have a particular need
to use these patents

811
00:52:04,630 --> 00:52:07,900
today if you're looking to sell the
company mater

812
00:52:07,900 --> 00:52:12,530
that's what you're selling you're
selling your assets

813
00:52:12,530 --> 00:52:15,780
and maybe that is you human resources
you know maybe that's the people you

814
00:52:15,780 --> 00:52:16,380
have

815
00:52:16,380 --> 00:52:20,130
working for you were then gonna go work
for the new guy the frequently

816
00:52:20,130 --> 00:52:23,210
that means the technologies you've
developed and can

817
00:52:23,210 --> 00:52:27,740
hands to them when they hand you a check
I'm so in my picking up from my point of

818
00:52:27,740 --> 00:52:28,270
view

819
00:52:28,270 --> 00:52:31,300
pants are huge for start-up

820
00:52:31,300 --> 00:52:35,010
on and they should be pursued I don't
remember what what your chin

821
00:52:35,010 --> 00:52:38,630
on

822
00:52:38,630 --> 00:52:42,710
depends publication is and option

823
00:52:42,710 --> 00:52:46,060
on at the very least I don't make it so
that your own stuff won't get used

824
00:52:46,060 --> 00:52:46,770
against you

825
00:52:46,770 --> 00:52:50,770
on or at least help to make that sell

826
00:52:50,770 --> 00:52:54,420
I am but doesn't really give you much

827
00:52:54,420 --> 00:52:58,220
in terms love building value for your
own company

828
00:52:58,220 --> 00:53:02,990
I'm gonna start in the back here and
work my way forward in bringing the back

829
00:53:02,990 --> 00:53:03,800
on my left ear

830
00:53:03,800 --> 00:53:10,800
yes

831
00:53:17,180 --> 00:53:24,180
can you define what you mean by the
triple indemnity thing

832
00:53:34,309 --> 00:53:34,669
0

833
00:53:34,669 --> 00:53:41,669
yes

834
00:53:42,229 --> 00:53:46,469
the the question goes to you on why
didn't I tell people about

835
00:53:46,469 --> 00:53:49,669
the potential for triple damages um

836
00:53:49,669 --> 00:53:53,469
the answer is because I only have an
hour

837
00:53:53,469 --> 00:53:56,659
on head okay

838
00:53:56,659 --> 00:54:00,130
ate yet it is worth mentioning that on
if you

839
00:54:00,130 --> 00:54:04,199
are willfully infringing a patent so you
know this pattern exists

840
00:54:04,199 --> 00:54:07,369
and you decide to infringe it anyway

841
00:54:07,369 --> 00:54:11,069
and you get sued you know you get burnt
on that and some tissues you

842
00:54:11,069 --> 00:54:14,419
you will and you get Fang you are found

843
00:54:14,419 --> 00:54:18,658
to have infringed and the patent is
valid and everything goes against you

844
00:54:18,659 --> 00:54:22,989
you can pay triple damages and damage is
generally speaking in the patent world

845
00:54:22,989 --> 00:54:23,709
go to

846
00:54:23,709 --> 00:54:27,529
either reasonable royalty or
Lostprophets

847
00:54:27,529 --> 00:54:34,529
or you know things like that that

848
00:54:45,679 --> 00:54:48,919
on a a good point has been I raised

849
00:54:48,919 --> 00:54:53,669
file pursuant to that which is that
there's really no advantage

850
00:54:53,669 --> 00:54:57,529
to going out and finding I prior

851
00:54:57,529 --> 00:55:01,339
arts if you're worried I get your fight
okay

852
00:55:01,339 --> 00:55:04,369
as a general I never to a patent search

853
00:55:04,369 --> 00:55:07,179
and I don't advise people to do patent
searches before they file their

854
00:55:07,179 --> 00:55:07,969
inventions

855
00:55:07,969 --> 00:55:11,209
unless it's something that's huge cap
yes

856
00:55:11,209 --> 00:55:14,249
on if it seems obvious thing yet you
going to Google

857
00:55:14,249 --> 00:55:17,939
he spent 10 minutes you save yourself
ten thousand dollars okay

858
00:55:17,939 --> 00:55:21,779
on however if you're in

859
00:55:21,779 --> 00:55:25,169
you know at did that you know an
advanced field

860
00:55:25,169 --> 00:55:28,339
and you know what other people are doing
generally speaking

861
00:55:28,339 --> 00:55:31,479
you don't want to go out and start
reading the prior art

862
00:55:31,479 --> 00:55:35,289
all it can at the end at the end of the
day can only be used against you

863
00:55:35,289 --> 00:55:38,589
you will have a duty to disclose it to
the patent office

864
00:55:38,589 --> 00:55:42,119
and if you find something that you doing
French you are now a willful

865
00:55:42,119 --> 00:55:42,729
infringement

866
00:55:42,729 --> 00:55:49,729
yes

867
00:55:55,730 --> 00:55:58,130
are you citing a patent on patent
trolling

868
00:55:58,130 --> 00:56:01,230
I

869
00:56:01,230 --> 00:56:08,000
panned acquisition assertion by non
inventor first party against the second

870
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:08,740
is pretty cool

871
00:56:08,740 --> 00:56:12,539
they get a patent owner that's just
application essay Pat Neshek

872
00:56:12,539 --> 00:56:15,859
at 2008 yeah

873
00:56:15,859 --> 00:56:19,240
I don't know I I

874
00:56:19,240 --> 00:56:25,869
Chris I don't profess to be logged in to
a spotless profession yes

875
00:56:25,869 --> 00:56:32,869
yes

876
00:56:34,200 --> 00:56:38,890
the question is whether you can still
have an in person interview with an

877
00:56:38,890 --> 00:56:40,618
examiner and the answer is yes

878
00:56:40,619 --> 00:56:44,049
if you are in Alexandria actually
they're just now opening

879
00:56:44,049 --> 00:56:47,049
up other pants offices across the
country which is

880
00:56:47,049 --> 00:56:50,529
interesting I'm so I guess now if you
are

881
00:56:50,529 --> 00:56:53,819
I think in Denver Colorado and maybe
Chicago

882
00:56:53,819 --> 00:56:58,750
and San Jose you can go in person and
talk to Appendix amor

883
00:56:58,750 --> 00:57:05,750
if they're the ones anyway yes well I
use Microsoft Word

884
00:57:06,829 --> 00:57:10,339
yes

885
00:57:10,339 --> 00:57:15,369
yes that's a processor so I have I'm
going to file an application on creating

886
00:57:15,369 --> 00:57:16,549
a pact with the processor

887
00:57:16,549 --> 00:57:19,849
on Vizio I mean honestly it's

888
00:57:19,849 --> 00:57:23,819
whatever you use X fake would do just
fine I am

889
00:57:23,819 --> 00:57:30,819
scanning for more questions scanning yes

890
00:57:37,460 --> 00:57:40,770
I mean that the question is if you are
filing patents defensively

891
00:57:40,770 --> 00:57:47,770
if you're publishing defense we should
you create claims

892
00:57:50,240 --> 00:57:57,240
I'm not sure I understand your question

893
00:57:58,240 --> 00:58:01,800
I C the question is how much like a
patent if your pet publishing

894
00:58:01,800 --> 00:58:03,369
defensively how much like a patent

895
00:58:03,369 --> 00:58:06,400
should your patent auctioneer

896
00:58:06,400 --> 00:58:09,920
publication book and the answer is it
doesn't really matter as long as it's

897
00:58:09,920 --> 00:58:11,290
clear and understandable

898
00:58:11,290 --> 00:58:14,259
so the anybody who's reading it would
understand oh yeah I see what's going on

899
00:58:14,260 --> 00:58:16,570
clearly this other guy he's trying to do
the same thing

900
00:58:16,570 --> 00:58:21,330
that's all you're looking for your
publishing defensively and we're done

901
00:58:21,330 --> 00:58:28,330
and I guess if you want to ask me more
things all hang out over there

902
00:58:29,970 --> 00:58:31,070
idea
