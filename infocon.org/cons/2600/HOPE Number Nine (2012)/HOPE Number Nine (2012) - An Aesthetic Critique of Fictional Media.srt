1
00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:04,510
naturals

2
00:00:04,510 --> 00:00:11,510
yet this yeah it is plugged in

3
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:16,910
this is instead a critique a fictional
media and

4
00:00:16,910 --> 00:00:20,240
I'm a graphic designer this is silly is
a developer and

5
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:23,380
our project today is going to talking
about how

6
00:00:23,380 --> 00:00:26,630
fictional media has a relationship with
real design

7
00:00:26,630 --> 00:00:29,790
and how I'm Howard they go back and
forth

8
00:00:29,790 --> 00:00:33,600
and also I'm sure give you a a visual
tour how visual

9
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:36,860
media has involved in film and how
that's

10
00:00:36,860 --> 00:00:40,329
kinda keeping pace with technology arm

11
00:00:40,329 --> 00:00:44,079
and sort of beginning with the origins
where

12
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:47,469
maybe most to the audience had no idea
about

13
00:00:47,469 --> 00:00:51,749
the weight media worked tool today word
everyone most everyone who watched all

14
00:00:51,749 --> 00:00:53,469
hazards or basic literacy

15
00:00:53,469 --> 00:01:00,469
so arm how many people here have seen
the movie hackers

16
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:05,970
fire everyone now everyone I've seen it
probably has a pretty strong opinion

17
00:01:05,970 --> 00:01:06,510
they either

18
00:01:06,510 --> 00:01:09,810
either hate it or they love it and its
part for the same reason

19
00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:14,240
and not it's because it's so very much a
moment I'm

20
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:17,520
it either so cheesy that it's like fun

21
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:20,530
or it's so the you know

22
00:01:20,530 --> 00:01:23,619
other particular mindset that it fits
them perfectly

23
00:01:23,619 --> 00:01:27,210
and it a I think the the thing to
remember is

24
00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:30,850
that as a critical audience it's useful
to remember that

25
00:01:30,850 --> 00:01:34,200
when something's being demonstrated a
film and has

26
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:39,030
a decorative elements it has a
functional element and it also has and

27
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:39,750
their development

28
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:43,920
so when we talk about something in a
film on

29
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:47,259
this scene here was sorta the like

30
00:01:47,259 --> 00:01:50,289
cyber arcade which is like a very like

31
00:01:50,289 --> 00:01:55,310
nineties fantasy and this really only
served narrative purpose

32
00:01:55,310 --> 00:01:58,880
so we can cut disentangle that from
other ailments like the very first scene

33
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:04,079
where the character is a you know trying
to hack into a system to

34
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:07,320
accomplish something and in this scene
it's very practical he's using

35
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:11,250
just a terminal with like and political
monochromatic screen and he's trying to

36
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:11,630
do

37
00:02:11,630 --> 00:02:15,840
a very specific task and so that's the
four sort of

38
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:18,880
on point I want to make which is to say
that

39
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:22,659
these other elements which are very your
decorative don't really

40
00:02:22,659 --> 00:02:26,170
%uh decry ordered the diminished the

41
00:02:26,170 --> 00:02:29,310
the ideas put forth in the more serious
ailments so

42
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:32,840
I guess that's something to remember
when we look at all these films because

43
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:37,330
as a person loves technology pricey
science fiction films and people

44
00:02:37,330 --> 00:02:40,950
the first thing I will say is all that
was so fake look how fake

45
00:02:40,950 --> 00:02:44,159
that interfaces no one would use a
computer like that that's not

46
00:02:44,159 --> 00:02:45,290
necessarily

47
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:48,819
the only thing you can get at it there's
it's not just

48
00:02:48,819 --> 00:02:52,519
the most sensational part thereof also
other elements so

49
00:02:52,519 --> 00:02:57,209
yeah I was on the bring up to go on
chance point this particular screen

50
00:02:57,209 --> 00:02:57,970
right here

51
00:02:57,970 --> 00:03:01,280
where Penn Jillette is the sysadmins and

52
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:04,530
he sees that somebody with password got
log sir

53
00:03:04,530 --> 00:03:08,519
this is probably one of the most
impractical looking command centers a

54
00:03:08,519 --> 00:03:08,810
good

55
00:03:08,810 --> 00:03:12,220
behalf but nobody could discern like to

56
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:15,930
know you'll be able to digest that have
information on all these like Walt

57
00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:20,629
screens or anything like that but in the
movie the purpose of it is to show

58
00:03:20,629 --> 00:03:24,579
look at how cool this place is like this
is really high tech because

59
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:29,420
at the time and the in like 95 came out
what's have screens that are big

60
00:03:29,420 --> 00:03:30,459
infusion like

61
00:03:30,459 --> 00:03:33,769
computers that seem big that is like

62
00:03:33,769 --> 00:03:37,459
that means that it's cool because that's
what the thinking was at the time

63
00:03:37,459 --> 00:03:40,680
but in real life when he's take a step
back like

64
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:45,069
that doesn't really work like that would
be distracting

65
00:03:45,069 --> 00:03:50,280
and also I wouldn't just see the
password God and that would just be how

66
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:50,909
I know

67
00:03:50,909 --> 00:03:54,609
whose who's online like we know it from
people who are tech

68
00:03:54,610 --> 00:03:57,819
tech-savvy but thats that's impractical
but

69
00:03:57,819 --> 00:04:02,860
a at the time this movie came out not
everybody was as tech savvy as a as

70
00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:06,120
most audiences are today so that's why
this is there

71
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:09,180
justice for like but narrative
decorative point of view

72
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:12,989
Aflac look at our schools angela's be in
a sysadmin

73
00:04:12,989 --> 00:04:17,399
thats so in that vein we have

74
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:21,940
the antagonise so the film using some
sort of personal virtual reality system

75
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:25,180
which maybe you would play at Dave and
Busters at that point but it wasn't

76
00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:25,580
really a

77
00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:31,150
a practical technology people are using
um and also it's kind of like a

78
00:04:31,150 --> 00:04:34,508
when you see this screen this is like a
login screen upon at the hackers and

79
00:04:34,509 --> 00:04:35,120
movie

80
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:38,259
I want to make the point that there's
something very special about the graphic

81
00:04:38,259 --> 00:04:39,520
design a of

82
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:43,430
media because it can be whatever you
want so someone's to look at the screen

83
00:04:43,430 --> 00:04:44,150
say

84
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:47,940
oh that's a very realistic it's it's
really a matter of taste to the personal

85
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:52,380
user so if they want to put something
that has stalls and bombs on it

86
00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:56,190
you can put that in your interface you
can use screencaps from something for

87
00:04:56,190 --> 00:04:58,759
the nineties and it would still work
functionally

88
00:04:58,759 --> 00:05:02,370
a so that it's very much a matter of
taste and it makes things

89
00:05:02,370 --> 00:05:06,870
um happen very quickly this is another
telling Almonte from this time

90
00:05:06,870 --> 00:05:10,360
they basically just sorta glued together
circuit boards

91
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:13,580
and this was to demonstrate like going
into cyberspace

92
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:18,090
and so are one thing that is very common
in science fiction movies

93
00:05:18,090 --> 00:05:22,490
is this tendency to really celebrate the
is dedicated circuit boards

94
00:05:22,490 --> 00:05:26,639
and monochromatic tech screens and
you'll see these things happen over and

95
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:27,800
over again there's like

96
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:31,960
maybe syriza 10 kinda tropes that every
film uses to different degrees and make

97
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:33,289
small tweaks

98
00:05:33,289 --> 00:05:38,139
I'll this image to I at the sort of
assuming into cyberspace

99
00:05:38,139 --> 00:05:41,440
as something that may be its first kinda
and consciousness from

100
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:46,190
2001 a Space Odyssey and in fact the got
the designer who put that together also

101
00:05:46,190 --> 00:05:47,219
made other film

102
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:51,039
the film called brainstorm and it sort
of a a scene that you'll see in almost

103
00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:53,810
any science fiction film when you're
entering into the media environment it's

104
00:05:53,810 --> 00:05:54,810
like a late

105
00:05:54,810 --> 00:05:59,449
work speed like in Star Wars and so once
again here's just

106
00:05:59,449 --> 00:06:03,960
I an element where it's showing this is
visualization of a computer might look

107
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:05,710
like what cyberspace might look like

108
00:06:05,710 --> 00:06:09,219
for an audience who really doesn't know
white technical

109
00:06:09,220 --> 00:06:13,130
aspect specification something has an
this is interesting to you see a figure

110
00:06:13,130 --> 00:06:14,130
in the screen

111
00:06:14,130 --> 00:06:17,759
it's sort of like this is supposed to be
the inside a computer and this is a

112
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:21,150
user inside a vote and networking it's
like identical that

113
00:06:21,150 --> 00:06:24,520
there's a sort of misunderstanding at
the way computers work a

114
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:27,630
you wouldn't really want to get
information of these cylinders of

115
00:06:27,630 --> 00:06:31,449
text I'll the same sort of variations

116
00:06:31,449 --> 00:06:35,020
arm and once again this is just like
something narrative to sort of

117
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:38,099
for an audience who had nose nothing and
wants to look at something interesting

118
00:06:38,099 --> 00:06:39,680
this something for the look at

119
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:43,030
I'll this final image from hackers in
1985 as

120
00:06:43,030 --> 00:06:46,430
so interesting because he's using the
sort of goggle interface

121
00:06:46,430 --> 00:06:50,030
and place for computer screen and that
is something that we

122
00:06:50,030 --> 00:06:53,810
are very interested in our days like
that Google Chrome is trying to develop

123
00:06:53,810 --> 00:06:54,639
that

124
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:58,860
and so there's as you can see there's
there's elements which are just sort of

125
00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:02,000
decorative fancy and very much
fashionable the time and the elements

126
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:02,590
that

127
00:07:02,590 --> 00:07:06,410
you could see as school if someone did
have that how they use a

128
00:07:06,410 --> 00:07:13,410
and that there's a good idea being
suggested

129
00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:17,979
so that's what leads to the matrix

130
00:07:17,979 --> 00:07:21,219
and I will talk about the matrix and
China Monica the same time

131
00:07:21,220 --> 00:07:24,669
because it kind of shows a very
important kinda transition and

132
00:07:24,669 --> 00:07:29,370
audience so evidence pretty familiar
with matrix it's sort of like

133
00:07:29,370 --> 00:07:32,870
up really a bellwether film and I'll

134
00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:35,910
you see this transition love I'll

135
00:07:35,910 --> 00:07:39,020
these the circuit board imagery to
monochromatic screens

136
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:42,139
and then it's interesting to to

137
00:07:42,139 --> 00:07:45,190
counterpoint that with join demonic
which is a very similar film

138
00:07:45,190 --> 00:07:48,590
and terms apply. and even had the same
protagonist you had

139
00:07:48,590 --> 00:07:52,139
gallery is playing this sorta special
hacker

140
00:07:52,139 --> 00:07:55,259
that sorted invaded cyberspace and
manipulated

141
00:07:55,259 --> 00:07:58,870
but the point I want to make is that
these images from China monic

142
00:07:58,870 --> 00:08:02,099
show a arm

143
00:08:02,099 --> 00:08:05,310
unsophisticated concept love on

144
00:08:05,310 --> 00:08:08,560
computers where people believe back then
that

145
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:13,060
our virtual spaces would have to be some
sort of ill computerize modified world

146
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:13,970
where they would be made

147
00:08:13,970 --> 00:08:18,870
polygons and you see that his interfaces
he has goggles & glasses that he flies

148
00:08:18,870 --> 00:08:22,340
to this weird cyberspace that looks like
glittering lights

149
00:08:22,340 --> 00:08:26,259
and then with transitions to more savvy
audiences

150
00:08:26,259 --> 00:08:29,979
you enter cyberspace through this jack
in your head and then it is

151
00:08:29,979 --> 00:08:34,270
as real as reality

152
00:08:34,270 --> 00:08:37,978
it was a the the first things I like

153
00:08:37,979 --> 00:08:41,669
I'll check to make sure arm

154
00:08:41,669 --> 00:08:44,699
we in 1995 to 2009 on

155
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:47,910
99 sorry arm

156
00:08:47,910 --> 00:08:51,380
so what's interesting about it to me is
that um

157
00:08:51,380 --> 00:08:55,910
as people who've lived through this time
you pry remember that

158
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:59,579
arm resolutions weren't as good and
other better

159
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:04,440
and now we have HD TVs and it's sort of
interesting to think that

160
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:07,620
we can sort extrapolate that what's that
was there is all

161
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:10,640
you start trying to make something as
real as you possibly can whatever the

162
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:12,710
specifications a graphical software

163
00:09:12,710 --> 00:09:16,310
and eventually you want to have
something that's just israel's reality

164
00:09:16,310 --> 00:09:19,970
so the the transition is this

165
00:09:19,970 --> 00:09:23,420
monochromatic technical screen

166
00:09:23,420 --> 00:09:28,790
and I'll but the the sort of punchline
to that serve idea would be maybe the

167
00:09:28,790 --> 00:09:29,329
movie

168
00:09:29,330 --> 00:09:33,320
conception where there is no technical
stuff going on you just have to take it

169
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:34,720
for granted that their

170
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:37,930
an architect creating a media
environment and then it's just as real

171
00:09:37,930 --> 00:09:39,780
as real life

172
00:09:39,780 --> 00:09:43,329
now another film that is supportive very
useful because it talks about lots of

173
00:09:43,330 --> 00:09:44,480
ideas at once

174
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:47,710
was Iron Man and on

175
00:09:47,710 --> 00:09:51,060
Iron Man sorta the quintessential

176
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:55,330
model for modern design because in 1950

177
00:09:55,330 --> 00:09:59,130
there was a signers named George Nelson
and he came up with this idea for the

178
00:09:59,130 --> 00:09:59,780
Woodman

179
00:09:59,780 --> 00:10:03,449
that all designed is a technically

180
00:10:03,450 --> 00:10:07,270
a driven by the need to be competitive
in war and so

181
00:10:07,270 --> 00:10:10,760
he had this famous speech where he had a
robot to mountain speech for a minute

182
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:11,960
talked about how

183
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:15,640
some the first draft sign was showing an
image of the man with like a rose and

184
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:17,439
I'm showing weak points

185
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:22,130
and that that evolved to you know when
you make swords how do you make a sort

186
00:10:22,130 --> 00:10:25,070
perfectly to kill a person how do you
make a bow and arrow

187
00:10:25,070 --> 00:10:29,310
extra fish in hitting someone from far
away and even talk about the movie

188
00:10:29,310 --> 00:10:32,560
arm so Tony Stark is the

189
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:36,900
wouldn't man and in his bedroom you see
this technology have

190
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:41,320
his glass window is showing a computer
screen where it's like superimpose you

191
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:42,800
can see the time he can

192
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:46,280
use the internet in his space and you'll
see that most will fill issue Total

193
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:47,600
Recall you see it in

194
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:50,880
I'm a different selves and I'll here's
another

195
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:55,230
classic troopers science fiction media's
though multiple screen a race

196
00:10:55,230 --> 00:10:59,610
and Om as you can see this is like his
laboratory has like different screens

197
00:10:59,610 --> 00:11:01,230
showing different imagery of

198
00:11:01,230 --> 00:11:05,390
up what he's working on and and then you
have the screen at him

199
00:11:05,390 --> 00:11:08,680
like what he's seeing in his suit I'll

200
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:12,130
and so the ASEAN all these different
examples

201
00:11:12,130 --> 00:11:15,790
that this is just this was to be one
person's

202
00:11:15,790 --> 00:11:19,930
um experience and he has multiple
different media environments which is

203
00:11:19,930 --> 00:11:20,740
sort of what we've

204
00:11:20,740 --> 00:11:25,160
from a cut bro cousin to him so he as
his computer screen which he sees

205
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:28,219
you know it's maybe this is the closest
to our computer screens although it's

206
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:29,540
like a big screen in

207
00:11:29,540 --> 00:11:33,050
its semi transparent annie is this like
holographic

208
00:11:33,050 --> 00:11:37,220
on display and this is another like
sorta

209
00:11:37,220 --> 00:11:41,750
hallmark love um science fiction films
is where they show these

210
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:45,800
um really gaudy I'll

211
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:49,020
holographic displays and this is an
example of something that's actually

212
00:11:49,020 --> 00:11:50,230
fairly

213
00:11:50,230 --> 00:11:53,600
productive like we could look at this
and say this isn't just

214
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:56,890
to look pretty this is something that is
useful because

215
00:11:56,890 --> 00:12:00,040
if you're in engineering wanna see more
all different parts above

216
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:03,230
schematic and see how the overlap it can
be very useful

217
00:12:03,230 --> 00:12:07,400
in fact there's a a graduate student
that was working on

218
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:10,530
a battery a new battery and he said that
he used what are the

219
00:12:10,530 --> 00:12:14,240
I'll inspirations he had was that he
built his

220
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:18,220
in with his %uh prototype in Photoshop
layers so we can look at how the overlap

221
00:12:18,220 --> 00:12:19,450
simultaneously

222
00:12:19,450 --> 00:12:23,210
and so and we looked at his whole
graphics system he was trying to

223
00:12:23,210 --> 00:12:29,650
any like that idea in his normal working
practice

224
00:12:29,650 --> 00:12:32,949
and this is sort of like a really funny
moment

225
00:12:32,950 --> 00:12:36,360
%uh and contemporary shell where you see
these in

226
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:40,010
this is from the Avengers but you'll see
the screens which are transparent

227
00:12:40,010 --> 00:12:43,890
now anyone uses monitors were probably
the first thing i think is

228
00:12:43,890 --> 00:12:46,650
all why would I want to be distracted
with something background I'm trying to

229
00:12:46,650 --> 00:12:47,620
look at the monitor

230
00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:50,870
while what extra benefit by half from
the Cedar Street

231
00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:54,360
and that's like once again where it
comes in to be more about

232
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:57,500
the narrative in that particular case so
in this scene

233
00:12:57,500 --> 00:13:00,490
you want to be able to see the actor and
know that they're looking at computer

234
00:13:00,490 --> 00:13:01,430
screens

235
00:13:01,430 --> 00:13:05,350
so this one way for the camera to look
through the screen is disabled

236
00:13:05,350 --> 00:13:09,390
screens transparent although and
practical use

237
00:13:09,390 --> 00:13:16,390
UN really have any reason to have your
skinny transparent

238
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:20,560
so this is a a few examples from real
life where

239
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:24,450
arm it just reminds us that these things
aren't just science fiction

240
00:13:24,450 --> 00:13:28,420
so for someone who maybe has a very
perfunctory knowledge of technology

241
00:13:28,420 --> 00:13:32,240
the lights go C felony think I'll that's
just science fiction

242
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:35,610
it's not real life it might be in the
future but a lot of these

243
00:13:35,610 --> 00:13:39,640
a ideas with our current technology are
being implemented and

244
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:43,460
some people are using them already so
leap motion

245
00:13:43,460 --> 00:13:46,630
came up with this on screen this

246
00:13:46,630 --> 00:13:49,830
environment where they're able to
navigate using a

247
00:13:49,830 --> 00:13:53,970
videos capturing hand lotion and this is
something that's already practical

248
00:13:53,970 --> 00:13:57,570
on although it's %uh evenly distributed
similarly

249
00:13:57,570 --> 00:14:00,650
people are working on virtual design
systems

250
00:14:00,650 --> 00:14:04,110
where virtual-reality design systems
where you can contract with something in

251
00:14:04,110 --> 00:14:05,320
a 3d space

252
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:09,520
a match before Google glass I'll these
are technologies where

253
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:12,980
people sometimes hackers will see
something film and

254
00:14:12,980 --> 00:14:17,050
builders build it and we have the
available components it's sort of

255
00:14:17,050 --> 00:14:20,430
where it comes to being like present-day
it sort of

256
00:14:20,430 --> 00:14:24,330
when we can finally make it mass
production mass produced in

257
00:14:24,330 --> 00:14:28,480
and very affordable that's when everyone
will have it but it's not a matter of

258
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:35,480
can this happen it's matter when will
this happen

259
00:14:37,050 --> 00:14:40,320
so um that leasing 20x point there's a

260
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:44,320
juridical mathematician is very
influential and

261
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:47,590
current programming then filled wobbler
keys at I'll

262
00:14:47,590 --> 00:14:50,790
to receive and borough and he has this

263
00:14:50,790 --> 00:14:54,099
this theory says a programming language
will

264
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:57,270
will be adopted if and only if the
permits users to do something that

265
00:14:57,270 --> 00:15:00,689
can't be on in any other way so this is
sort of

266
00:15:00,690 --> 00:15:04,440
a as a good way to think about new
technique new media environments for

267
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:05,190
technology

268
00:15:05,190 --> 00:15:08,890
where you know ives I'm not a slut
people

269
00:15:08,890 --> 00:15:12,500
at the Starbucks is used iPad's to take
picture of the screen

270
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:16,690
and a iPad sort of proliferated so
quickly because

271
00:15:16,690 --> 00:15:20,140
it was able to do something they
couldn't do before those like this

272
00:15:20,140 --> 00:15:23,430
tablet that they can interact with they
don't need a separate screen that's very

273
00:15:23,430 --> 00:15:24,090
small

274
00:15:24,090 --> 00:15:27,350
they can use as a camera they need these
other things and so

275
00:15:27,350 --> 00:15:30,750
om and the film 2001:

276
00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:34,530
you'll see that they had these things
which people point to and say like 2001

277
00:15:34,530 --> 00:15:35,560
predicted the iPad

278
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:38,950
so a it's not believe the idea that so

279
00:15:38,950 --> 00:15:42,350
important that these things it's sort of
like when you can make it do something

280
00:15:42,350 --> 00:15:43,920
that people want to do

281
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:47,260
that's what we get adopted it'll get
adopted very quickly

282
00:15:47,260 --> 00:15:51,660
and so just lower on this page this is
like another multiple screen array

283
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:55,219
from 2001 and that's for the

284
00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:58,800
what the most recording images and a

285
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:02,360
science fiction as these different
examples above

286
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:06,320
multiple screen a race and looks very
cinematic you see

287
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:10,330
this is from Watchmen you see all these
TV screens this is from the movie

288
00:16:10,330 --> 00:16:14,250
twelve Monkeys you'll see these
different and this is from the net

289
00:16:14,250 --> 00:16:18,870
arm multiple screens are important in
the sense that

290
00:16:18,870 --> 00:16:22,470
you can have a screen for whatever type
a single you want so

291
00:16:22,470 --> 00:16:27,070
this is the most practical example and
Watchmen which was set in the eighties

292
00:16:27,070 --> 00:16:31,110
the the character wanted to have every
news channel a different TV so you just

293
00:16:31,110 --> 00:16:33,650
have a different TV it's very practical
uses have a different screen for

294
00:16:33,650 --> 00:16:34,480
different signal

295
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:38,710
but the interesting thing is that they
also should have looked

296
00:16:38,710 --> 00:16:41,740
really nice they look really theatrical

297
00:16:41,740 --> 00:16:44,980
so people get distracted by that i dnt
think like

298
00:16:44,980 --> 00:16:49,210
will have a wall of TV's that's very
that'll be a very useful way to look at

299
00:16:49,210 --> 00:16:49,710
things

300
00:16:49,710 --> 00:16:53,560
but really it's a matter of a screen
space and since information

301
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:57,070
her a resolution sunscreens are so
powerful if you

302
00:16:57,070 --> 00:17:00,810
have just up one screen but you can put
multiple windows you're accomplishing

303
00:17:00,810 --> 00:17:02,190
the same goals

304
00:17:02,190 --> 00:17:05,439
so in some cases that's an example where

305
00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:08,540
its its very theatrical in other cases
it's

306
00:17:08,540 --> 00:17:12,459
a very practical depending on its
particular usage

307
00:17:12,459 --> 00:17:15,860
on this is a screen from

308
00:17:15,860 --> 00:17:20,079
a clockwork orange hands it's a kind of
pivotal scene

309
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:23,569
and the movie where they devised this
little ego affect where they had

310
00:17:23,569 --> 00:17:28,409
initial arm forced to watch a film
environment and

311
00:17:28,410 --> 00:17:31,750
it's sort of interesting because a
there's

312
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:35,750
there's no practical reason why the
sorts of things can happen in fact they

313
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:37,630
have happened and it's actually a

314
00:17:37,630 --> 00:17:41,320
sorta tongue in cheek up jab that

315
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:44,919
CIA techniques are my control ideas

316
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:48,220
where you have this individual whose
forced to watch

317
00:17:48,220 --> 00:17:51,880
a series of flashing imager the imagery
and it was sorta

318
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:55,910
potentially brainwash a that the user

319
00:17:55,910 --> 00:17:59,520
and so this

320
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:03,550
combined with images like this

321
00:18:03,550 --> 00:18:06,830
where I and the movie Blade Runner you
see this a

322
00:18:06,830 --> 00:18:11,419
a serve index database: screens

323
00:18:11,420 --> 00:18:15,250
art assertive snapshots of things that

324
00:18:15,250 --> 00:18:18,330
do exist in real life and it's just a
matter of

325
00:18:18,330 --> 00:18:22,100
whose implementing them as far as like
whether or not their future futuristic

326
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:22,630
heard

327
00:18:22,630 --> 00:18:27,520
or not and on so

328
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:31,129
on that point have lot of screens

329
00:18:31,130 --> 00:18:34,300
I'll this is like a screencap of

330
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:38,760
surveillance and so surveillance is one
of those times where in real life people

331
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:39,740
are using these

332
00:18:39,740 --> 00:18:43,690
really expensive really big imagery
walls to

333
00:18:43,690 --> 00:18:47,640
look at multiples I'll scenes and see
like is someone

334
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:52,810
doing something shady I'll so you can
see that art imitates life pretty

335
00:18:52,810 --> 00:18:59,810
directly in this case

336
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:06,769
so this is a movie brainstorm that came
out in 1983 and this was

337
00:19:06,769 --> 00:19:10,369
sort of another to go back to that idea
when we had the movie

338
00:19:10,369 --> 00:19:13,470
I'll we were talking about that had a

339
00:19:13,470 --> 00:19:17,009
flashing imagery it was the same graphic
designers 2001

340
00:19:17,009 --> 00:19:20,779
and what's interesting about this was it
was right before

341
00:19:20,779 --> 00:19:25,229
arm are common usage of digital wireless
technology so

342
00:19:25,229 --> 00:19:29,249
you see these individuals using these
helmets and I'll

343
00:19:29,249 --> 00:19:33,849
they're all connected to the central
wire and so it's interesting that

344
00:19:33,849 --> 00:19:39,259
in the past it was very in and this
scene is he like the physical tape cell

345
00:19:39,259 --> 00:19:42,489
I'll we had up sort of I'll

346
00:19:42,489 --> 00:19:45,889
display a the current technology

347
00:19:45,889 --> 00:19:49,489
the day being white supposedly the
future would look like

348
00:19:49,489 --> 00:19:52,849
and that sort of an interesting thing
that occurs overtime where

349
00:19:52,849 --> 00:19:56,080
all we can do is sheesh

350
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:59,428
explain things in the term at the
language in the day so

351
00:19:59,429 --> 00:20:03,389
on if you show and imagery of someone
wearing goggles that's not a close

352
00:20:03,389 --> 00:20:06,090
attached to a wire 1980

353
00:20:06,090 --> 00:20:09,199
people know what it is I just think I
what is that just classes

354
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:12,580
they will understand the the implication
so

355
00:20:12,580 --> 00:20:15,840
so the portents

356
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:19,599
a film is such that when you introduce
an audience to an idea

357
00:20:19,599 --> 00:20:23,320
like in the much-maligned Minority
Report where everyone knows the scenes

358
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:24,489
where he's using a

359
00:20:24,489 --> 00:20:28,570
interface review move switches his hands
around he's not using a mouse

360
00:20:28,570 --> 00:20:32,599
arm everyone even if they're not very
tech savvy at all they can say

361
00:20:32,599 --> 00:20:35,739
alike in minority report and it's in
their consciousness

362
00:20:35,739 --> 00:20:39,169
enters the possibility a planter places
they can sell

363
00:20:39,169 --> 00:20:42,419
as we all know on companies will

364
00:20:42,419 --> 00:20:46,700
sell whatever they want to sell dollars
so the best thing the only sell white

365
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:47,349
people or

366
00:20:47,349 --> 00:20:50,939
by so if people are the most comfortable
with now sis

367
00:20:50,940 --> 00:20:55,119
they're gonna keep on making beautiful
houses if people really really want to

368
00:20:55,119 --> 00:20:55,570
buy

369
00:20:55,570 --> 00:20:59,029
an environment where they can use just
their finger like an iPad

370
00:20:59,029 --> 00:21:02,639
they'll make iPod iPad's so that sort of
an interesting

371
00:21:02,639 --> 00:21:06,309
and role for film where you come up with
an idea

372
00:21:06,309 --> 00:21:10,099
and it's so interesting people want to
experience it

373
00:21:10,099 --> 00:21:14,320
and then it moves the actual market this
is %uh

374
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:19,999
the film a by Terry Gilliam the same
person who to talk about is called

375
00:21:19,999 --> 00:21:20,639
Brazil

376
00:21:20,639 --> 00:21:24,570
and he's very interested and filming
film filming

377
00:21:24,570 --> 00:21:27,749
multiple screen a raise in real life and
on

378
00:21:27,749 --> 00:21:31,979
this is an interesting have critique of
culture because

379
00:21:31,979 --> 00:21:36,349
as you can see um these people are using
these miniature screens

380
00:21:36,349 --> 00:21:39,789
and its its sorta commentary on the

381
00:21:39,789 --> 00:21:43,908
economy like they're saying wall in this
future world people are so

382
00:21:43,909 --> 00:21:47,739
may be poor or that the system is so
beleaguered all they can afford to these

383
00:21:47,739 --> 00:21:50,659
monochromatic small screens but people
solely to see them

384
00:21:50,659 --> 00:21:55,149
so an office environment they make these
I'll magnifying glasses

385
00:21:55,149 --> 00:21:59,679
so they can see their small screens well
this is not too far from reality

386
00:21:59,679 --> 00:22:04,330
because a everyone's used to their the
iPhones and they're so portable is so

387
00:22:04,330 --> 00:22:05,059
useful

388
00:22:05,059 --> 00:22:07,979
and then if you go online and look at
the third party accessories they have

389
00:22:07,979 --> 00:22:09,479
all sorts of things that are seen

390
00:22:09,479 --> 00:22:13,820
impractical like you know you can put
your iPhone in a docking all the senate

391
00:22:13,820 --> 00:22:14,918
to stare you can put

392
00:22:14,919 --> 00:22:17,999
um Handycam folder on your a

393
00:22:17,999 --> 00:22:22,039
cell phone to make it like that a a
camera that you could

394
00:22:22,039 --> 00:22:25,349
a used to film a TV show and we all know
it's like

395
00:22:25,349 --> 00:22:29,809
you should use the most a the best

396
00:22:29,809 --> 00:22:33,249
technology you can for your specific
role but it's just there's a certain

397
00:22:33,249 --> 00:22:34,089
level love

398
00:22:34,089 --> 00:22:39,349
I'll practicality to everyone has
iPhones everyone knows how to use them

399
00:22:39,349 --> 00:22:42,668
events making ass for them we'll just
stick with that small thing

400
00:22:42,669 --> 00:22:45,729
and then at peripherals to it to make it
useful again

401
00:22:45,729 --> 00:22:49,749
but it's sort of like an interesting
sorta like the Star Wars like

402
00:22:49,749 --> 00:22:54,179
gritty future where even though it's but
it could be better cuz it's the future

403
00:22:54,179 --> 00:22:56,080
we take these kind of weird lateral

404
00:22:56,080 --> 00:23:00,399
backward steps because I've whatever is
popular and there's like this fashion

405
00:23:00,399 --> 00:23:01,200
element let

406
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:05,109
thats its throughout arm both these
films

407
00:23:05,109 --> 00:23:09,029
and reality so this is from the movie
gamer

408
00:23:09,029 --> 00:23:12,389
and this is like a contemporary future
and I think it says

409
00:23:12,389 --> 00:23:16,249
interesting transition now like I said
hi everyone's become more Saudi

410
00:23:16,249 --> 00:23:19,690
and then used to seeing screens to sing
screens in everyday life you see digital

411
00:23:19,690 --> 00:23:20,480
billboards

412
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:24,159
that we finally been able to give up on
the sort of

413
00:23:24,159 --> 00:23:28,079
down talking like are gonna make it
looks like the screens look 10 years ago

414
00:23:28,079 --> 00:23:29,089
so I know everyone

415
00:23:29,089 --> 00:23:32,908
knows what I'm talking about now we can
finally say will make the screen look as

416
00:23:32,909 --> 00:23:34,419
interesting as possible

417
00:23:34,419 --> 00:23:37,749
because everyone gets the idea that it's
a screen so

418
00:23:37,749 --> 00:23:40,940
yell you see these um multiple images

419
00:23:40,940 --> 00:23:44,089
screens within screens which is sort of
the way that we navigate the internet

420
00:23:44,089 --> 00:23:44,849
now

421
00:23:44,849 --> 00:23:48,619
this is the way we use a computer you
know we have what 11

422
00:23:48,619 --> 00:23:52,730
applications running at once and so this
is inception which says it is sort of

423
00:23:52,730 --> 00:23:53,139
like

424
00:23:53,139 --> 00:23:56,859
an interesting conclusion to the

425
00:23:56,859 --> 00:23:59,918
the the linear progression where at
first we

426
00:23:59,919 --> 00:24:04,070
we wanted to tell you I was in fear by
showing you actual computer chip see its

427
00:24:04,070 --> 00:24:05,820
computers computer chips

428
00:24:05,820 --> 00:24:09,918
and then we had joined a monic where was
sort of like a cyber world where we have

429
00:24:09,919 --> 00:24:12,249
polygon so that you can tell to appear

430
00:24:12,249 --> 00:24:16,529
and that arm it's telling that this
character very honest

431
00:24:16,529 --> 00:24:20,179
architect but you never see her building
you never see her

432
00:24:20,179 --> 00:24:23,929
interacting with her interface it sort
of on

433
00:24:23,929 --> 00:24:28,389
now so accepted that like this is
supposed to be with in someone's mind

434
00:24:28,389 --> 00:24:32,730
in a world that she might be generating
but it's a sort of bypassing

435
00:24:32,730 --> 00:24:36,499
interfaces altogether but even still

436
00:24:36,499 --> 00:24:40,559
in this scene and which the main
character has entered

437
00:24:40,559 --> 00:24:44,928
his own mind and is seeing some things
protect himself you see that

438
00:24:44,929 --> 00:24:48,519
in this bedroom there's this this line
work this bread

439
00:24:48,519 --> 00:24:51,829
which is reminiscent of a loss maybe
Tron

440
00:24:51,829 --> 00:24:55,168
where on at a loss of self car a
subconscious level we're still telling

441
00:24:55,169 --> 00:24:55,879
people see

442
00:24:55,879 --> 00:24:59,089
like with this is a generated media
environment

443
00:24:59,089 --> 00:25:02,519
because we're giving you the spread work
that proves that it's not

444
00:25:02,519 --> 00:25:07,019
about that its computer or that it's in
someone's mind that it's not

445
00:25:07,019 --> 00:25:10,079
it's not real life

446
00:25:10,079 --> 00:25:13,859
so this is Minority Report which I said
it's sort of like the Seminole

447
00:25:13,859 --> 00:25:16,989
example love the handsfree

448
00:25:16,989 --> 00:25:20,889
media environment that this or that the
direction people are going

449
00:25:20,889 --> 00:25:24,960
um interestingly to you see at the body
on the screen

450
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:28,320
is as part of a plot that the everything
they could use

451
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:31,749
a computer interface to predict the
future that was sort of how

452
00:25:31,749 --> 00:25:35,429
the the plot of the movie came together
that what the people

453
00:25:35,429 --> 00:25:38,739
was making a minority report a different
example

454
00:25:38,739 --> 00:25:43,179
what they thought the future would be
but arm at went out to that

455
00:25:43,179 --> 00:25:46,889
we talk about inception the matrix try
on these other things

456
00:25:46,889 --> 00:25:50,289
it's very evident that we think that the
ultimate goal is that

457
00:25:50,289 --> 00:25:54,249
will be no separation from human beings
and their interface that it's sort of

458
00:25:54,249 --> 00:25:54,710
like

459
00:25:54,710 --> 00:25:58,409
we're going to enter Computerworld going
to using our minds to interact

460
00:25:58,409 --> 00:26:01,909
but right now there's a sort of
competitive ehlmann like

461
00:26:01,909 --> 00:26:05,799
how would you actually ensure that world
so I can this film there's a sort of

462
00:26:05,799 --> 00:26:06,119
like

463
00:26:06,119 --> 00:26:09,259
weird water bath in the matrix they have
that sort of

464
00:26:09,259 --> 00:26:14,679
mine Jack arm and inception they have a
sort of injection

465
00:26:14,679 --> 00:26:17,779
a that parts up for grabs now

466
00:26:17,779 --> 00:26:21,019
I i mentioned tidy up the multi-screen

467
00:26:21,019 --> 00:26:24,720
and this is a fine example love where
the movies

468
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:28,379
get it wrong because they're just trying
to be decorative

469
00:26:28,379 --> 00:26:32,089
on when you see a the

470
00:26:32,089 --> 00:26:36,690
manipulated the film director working on
his simulated person

471
00:26:36,690 --> 00:26:40,519
he's using three screens talk at the
same image

472
00:26:40,519 --> 00:26:43,669
as examples where it might look good on
film

473
00:26:43,669 --> 00:26:47,489
like we're showing this really high tech
looking thing

474
00:26:47,489 --> 00:26:51,019
but as actual user he's not getting any
benefit from

475
00:26:51,019 --> 00:26:54,589
has multiple screens so it sorted

476
00:26:54,589 --> 00:26:57,710
and how you use it had this is a very
good example love

477
00:26:57,710 --> 00:27:02,059
where it seems really high tech but it's
not a very good application up the

478
00:27:02,059 --> 00:27:07,450
of the the tool because what he's
getting is a picture a face that is

479
00:27:07,450 --> 00:27:10,739
as big as maybe ten feet tall

480
00:27:10,739 --> 00:27:14,519
but he's missing information in between
the different parts so like it's

481
00:27:14,519 --> 00:27:18,579
we can obviously building just off their
head that the face but that why it would

482
00:27:18,579 --> 00:27:21,589
you wanna not see that spaces in between
the face

483
00:27:21,589 --> 00:27:28,589
it sort of just decorative

484
00:27:31,750 --> 00:27:35,160
so arm this movie called The 13th Floor

485
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:38,790
and a it sort it was like in that same
area as the matrix

486
00:27:38,790 --> 00:27:43,860
and I was about this designer was able
to build like a virtual reality

487
00:27:43,860 --> 00:27:47,500
sorta very similar to like the matrix
but with his like their own stylistic

488
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:48,210
twists

489
00:27:48,210 --> 00:27:52,440
arm and I think that this is an
interesting point that if you see this

490
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:53,960
composed great it's sort of like

491
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:57,280
that Shabbat of Inception arm how do you

492
00:27:57,280 --> 00:28:01,190
and for people that they're looking at a
mediated environment if it looks as good

493
00:28:01,190 --> 00:28:02,020
as reality

494
00:28:02,020 --> 00:28:05,629
and they do it here by showing this red
superimposed on it

495
00:28:05,630 --> 00:28:09,280
now if anyone watches football or
basketball maybe

496
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:13,720
when they show instant replay that we
have the technology to show it in real

497
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:14,160
time

498
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:17,580
we can make it look as real as if it was
a live broadcast but the law

499
00:28:17,580 --> 00:28:21,010
very suddenly slow it down so that

500
00:28:21,010 --> 00:28:24,210
on some perceptual level you can make a
difference between

501
00:28:24,210 --> 00:28:27,540
oh that was reality I was watching and
this is this is fake

502
00:28:27,540 --> 00:28:31,070
for this is like a mediated experience
so

503
00:28:31,070 --> 00:28:34,260
right now the way we handle that is
maybe as a

504
00:28:34,260 --> 00:28:38,970
leave leave over from our history of
knowing that resolution wasn't that good

505
00:28:38,970 --> 00:28:42,360
that we show like somethings resolving

506
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:45,410
from a bread to the actual shapes

507
00:28:45,410 --> 00:28:49,080
that's like our current understanding a
bit so

508
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:56,000
imagine we see a cat in real life say
that an army environment we see a person

509
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:56,600
walking

510
00:28:56,600 --> 00:29:01,830
to show that it was mediated environment
maybe you show at like sometimes shaking

511
00:29:01,830 --> 00:29:02,330
out of

512
00:29:02,330 --> 00:29:05,550
existence sometimes you see it as a
great and then popping into full

513
00:29:05,550 --> 00:29:06,270
resolution

514
00:29:06,270 --> 00:29:09,530
that's our current concept of the way
things work

515
00:29:09,530 --> 00:29:13,060
arm so

516
00:29:13,060 --> 00:29:17,379
to to to come back to my original point
out how these things feedback on each

517
00:29:17,380 --> 00:29:17,840
other

518
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:22,620
that same guy there is this as a
engineering student who watched the

519
00:29:22,620 --> 00:29:23,570
movie Iron Man

520
00:29:23,570 --> 00:29:26,929
and then he got ideas from it what are
the ideas was that

521
00:29:26,930 --> 00:29:30,130
he was thinking while there's a real
problem

522
00:29:30,130 --> 00:29:34,560
about energy and that the protagonist
comes up with this battery device this

523
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:35,560
arc reactor

524
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:39,570
so he didn't create a arc reactor but
she said reexamined

525
00:29:39,570 --> 00:29:42,909
the notion that how to make a really
powerful small

526
00:29:42,910 --> 00:29:46,460
battery that maybe that could write a
power a car

527
00:29:46,460 --> 00:29:49,940
and so accuse the sample based on the

528
00:29:49,940 --> 00:29:53,540
question pro post by a movie to make a
real life

529
00:29:53,540 --> 00:29:56,770
prototype so this is a demonstration of

530
00:29:56,770 --> 00:30:00,550
how the questions and the heidi is

531
00:30:00,550 --> 00:30:04,649
brought to light and film are very very
important for

532
00:30:04,650 --> 00:30:08,200
how we as a society make hard choices
what's important

533
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:13,360
what's a problem on in this is an
example above

534
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:16,400
us a schoolroom from a colleague of mine
in

535
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:20,040
England at Durham University they've a
synergy lab where these kids are

536
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:20,990
actually using

537
00:30:20,990 --> 00:30:24,510
these tables these these computer tables

538
00:30:24,510 --> 00:30:28,570
for their everyday activities so they're
actually interacting with this

539
00:30:28,570 --> 00:30:32,120
environment which seems very high tech
err in the future

540
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:35,700
but this is the way that they're getting
their daily exercises so

541
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:39,010
once again this is an example how the
future's not completely

542
00:30:39,010 --> 00:30:43,770
evenly distributed so it's not a matter
of chronological time

543
00:30:43,770 --> 00:30:48,260
where 0 in 2008 I was supposed to get my
hover board where's my hoverboard

544
00:30:48,260 --> 00:30:52,020
it's more a matter of when Jimmy

545
00:30:52,020 --> 00:30:55,480
get the phenomenon to happen based on a
request

546
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:59,230
you know a when we come up with an idea
enough people have to

547
00:30:59,230 --> 00:31:02,230
work on it and clamor for it for to be
executed

548
00:31:02,230 --> 00:31:06,270
so there are people like this professor
who says oh well

549
00:31:06,270 --> 00:31:09,639
we see that people are going to use
these light tables

550
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:13,820
and in the future because it's useful
for some reason now let's start testing

551
00:31:13,820 --> 00:31:15,120
at let's see how it works

552
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:19,390
arm and so as a sort of conclusion i'd
assertive

553
00:31:19,390 --> 00:31:22,550
give this a thing to remember that

554
00:31:22,550 --> 00:31:26,710
when you're making argument %uh the
floss for Hagel had this concept you

555
00:31:26,710 --> 00:31:26,960
know

556
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:30,440
give a thesis an idea and then

557
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:33,720
you come up with the antithesis for you
come up with all the things that

558
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:37,770
maybe disagree with that ur the opposite
and he put it together

559
00:31:37,770 --> 00:31:41,660
and you get though the most correct
answer the synthesis on both parts of

560
00:31:41,660 --> 00:31:42,240
ideas

561
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:45,370
so that's a good way to think about that
critical elements

562
00:31:45,370 --> 00:31:49,110
and fell where we have a reality

563
00:31:49,110 --> 00:31:52,630
the contemporary possibilities of
Science where

564
00:31:52,630 --> 00:31:56,170
we can do things like make table screens
weekend

565
00:31:56,170 --> 00:31:59,690
make Google Glasses but we also know
things like

566
00:31:59,690 --> 00:32:04,160
from the movie Brazil we we know what is
a possible failing

567
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:09,120
we know what's the dangers so all those
things are being reflected in shell

568
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:14,410
we we like the director Ingmar Bergman
he said films reflect reality

569
00:32:14,410 --> 00:32:17,640
that's really what they do whether it's
a movie set in the future the past to

570
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:18,480
the present

571
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:22,290
the really addressing our everyday
interests and needs

572
00:32:22,290 --> 00:32:26,320
so when you see a film it's really
making it

573
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:30,179
a statement about this is the way we
live our lives this way we should live

574
00:32:30,180 --> 00:32:30,870
our lives

575
00:32:30,870 --> 00:32:35,140
so people take the reality they reflect
on and film

576
00:32:35,140 --> 00:32:39,250
and that comes up with a synthetic
phenomenology which is to say

577
00:32:39,250 --> 00:32:42,540
we all seen people build a computer that
looks like

578
00:32:42,540 --> 00:32:45,760
r2 d2 we've all seen people that arm

579
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:49,460
make the iPhone look like um a
character's

580
00:32:49,460 --> 00:32:53,990
phone in a movie that we are actively

581
00:32:53,990 --> 00:32:57,000
and self-consciously myth mimicking

582
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:01,050
the things you can sell and that it's
important member

583
00:33:01,050 --> 00:33:04,490
that even when it seems like a film is

584
00:33:04,490 --> 00:33:07,590
I'll cheesy like the movie hackers for
that the

585
00:33:07,590 --> 00:33:11,380
technology is really dated that we can
still remember

586
00:33:11,380 --> 00:33:15,330
to stripped out the parts that are
decorative a narrative basin member

587
00:33:15,330 --> 00:33:20,040
what parts the summer actually making it
a suggestion are making it interesting

588
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:24,700
commentary on the way we use technology
so maybe we'd all aware

589
00:33:24,700 --> 00:33:28,490
arm cut off leather jackets and
skateboard

590
00:33:28,490 --> 00:33:31,960
but we do want to have these losses

591
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:37,380
so we don't have to carry around a
screen

592
00:33:37,380 --> 00:33:42,470
thank you

593
00:33:42,470 --> 00:33:46,780
at all an honest something to sign up
for an answer it's very witty style

594
00:33:46,780 --> 00:33:49,990
so anyway if you want to continue will
will be on there like a

595
00:33:49,990 --> 00:33:53,290
adding to the conversation at it we have
more examples that we

596
00:33:53,290 --> 00:33:56,889
to talk about talk so I yeah its

597
00:33:56,890 --> 00:33:57,870
across X
