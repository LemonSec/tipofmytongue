1
00:00:01,569 --> 00:00:07,220
ya recovered from last night drink water
drink coffee

2
00:00:07,220 --> 00:00:11,059
maybe some rubble call alright so I'm a

3
00:00:11,059 --> 00:00:15,460
hi mister X everyone and my talk is
called a wine names matter

4
00:00:15,460 --> 00:00:21,140
and Dom there's another talk I just
wanna reference very quickly before I

5
00:00:21,140 --> 00:00:22,439
get into the nature this

6
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:27,000
it was at 28°c 3 call the what's in a
name it was about the history of names

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,240
and while I find that extremely
fascinating I won't be covering it is

8
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:33,380
just wanna do kinda shout out because
the history of names is equally a

9
00:00:33,380 --> 00:00:36,809
encompassing for the stuff on much

10
00:00:36,809 --> 00:00:41,199
this talk is much more about names and
how it relates to identity with the

11
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:42,410
nature of identity is

12
00:00:42,410 --> 00:00:46,149
and in theory some possible solutions
and proposals for how to reaffirm it

13
00:00:46,149 --> 00:00:47,190
this with them

14
00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:50,320
existing technology architecture are so

15
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:54,629
this is going to be difficult given the
stalk twice before the first time I give

16
00:00:54,629 --> 00:00:55,269
it

17
00:00:55,270 --> 00:00:59,199
lasted an hour and a half before I got
cut off and the second time a cut out

18
00:00:59,199 --> 00:00:59,980
half the duck

19
00:00:59,980 --> 00:01:04,129
and it still lasted like an hour so I've
got like an hour philosophy in an hour

20
00:01:04,129 --> 00:01:07,189
talking and trying to a boil it down
into

21
00:01:07,189 --> 00:01:11,659
like 45 minutes or something like that
so if I gloss over anything

22
00:01:11,659 --> 00:01:14,799
and you want to know more and I ran
outta time for Q&A just come find me

23
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:17,909
afterwards cuz other stuff is really a
important and

24
00:01:17,909 --> 00:01:21,710
I'm interested in talking to learn and
more from people a

25
00:01:21,710 --> 00:01:24,920
I basically have two points with this
talk because I don't have any solutions

26
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:25,650
yet

27
00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:28,750
it's all kind of an exploration of my
own so

28
00:01:28,750 --> 00:01:32,530
if something seems kinda experimental or
incomplete that's because it is

29
00:01:32,530 --> 00:01:35,159
and it's because I'm reaching out and
trying to get other people to discuss

30
00:01:35,159 --> 00:01:36,520
this 12 points the talk

31
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:39,950
is to get people to discuss it and the
other point is get people to ask

32
00:01:39,950 --> 00:01:41,590
questions that I haven't asked yet

33
00:01:41,590 --> 00:01:45,040
I think that's very important so

34
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:48,369
want to start off with a couple quick
questions it's hard to see with the

35
00:01:48,369 --> 00:01:49,060
letter but

36
00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:54,369
how many people in here have a name
hands okay

37
00:01:54,369 --> 00:02:00,049
anyone here to doesn't have a name does
anybody here have a name they've given

38
00:02:00,049 --> 00:02:00,899
themselves

39
00:02:00,899 --> 00:02:05,420
okay few people so

40
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:09,619
before I get into it does anybody
recognize this picture this paint em

41
00:02:09,619 --> 00:02:14,760
this is my own modification of the the
mask American Gothic

42
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:19,620
American Gothic that very interesting
context for this painter has painted

43
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:24,340
its from 1930 by a guy named grant would
and it was kind of thrown together the

44
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:27,190
people there they weren't actually
farmers there's a lot of context in

45
00:02:27,190 --> 00:02:31,290
history to it and it was exhibited and a
couple other art galleries and things

46
00:02:31,290 --> 00:02:32,290
like that a really

47
00:02:32,290 --> 00:02:36,929
didn't get much attention until a couple
people in iowa decided it didn't

48
00:02:36,930 --> 00:02:38,310
actually represent that

49
00:02:38,310 --> 00:02:42,150
the binding you know that the Hampshire
tourism

50
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:45,550
didn't represent them at all and I
started criticizing it and San this

51
00:02:45,550 --> 00:02:49,400
image does not represent who we are and
at that point all kinds a controversy

52
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:50,410
began to happen

53
00:02:50,410 --> 00:02:53,410
and that's when it became famous and
that was when it became known to the

54
00:02:53,410 --> 00:02:54,040
public eye

55
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:58,500
so it's very interesting that the image
that this projected when people that's

56
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:02,379
disagreed with how that image cast upon
their identity

57
00:03:02,379 --> 00:03:06,190
that that's what made them care about so

58
00:03:06,190 --> 00:03:09,510
that's kinda what this talk it's about
its lookin both internally and

59
00:03:09,510 --> 00:03:10,959
externally into how identity

60
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:16,489
works so gonna start off with a
something really quickly going back to

61
00:03:16,489 --> 00:03:19,010
anybody here familiar with the Google+
Nemours

62
00:03:19,010 --> 00:03:23,909
yeah I could make you must talk but I
she's very a brilliant and I'm sure it

63
00:03:23,909 --> 00:03:24,650
was awesome

64
00:03:24,650 --> 00:03:29,110
I was personally involved in the coup
followers and for that

65
00:03:29,110 --> 00:03:32,120
I was really really excited about
Google+ when I came out to start with

66
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:33,040
the story at all

67
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:36,730
I I was hoping to all kinds of people
out to a family reunion I was trying to

68
00:03:36,730 --> 00:03:38,500
get my family into it are

69
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:41,459
there's a bunch of really great things
that it was solvent as bunch of like

70
00:03:41,459 --> 00:03:43,540
privacy issues that I had with Facebook

71
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:47,659
Google was actually really responding to
things the gender privacy controls the

72
00:03:47,659 --> 00:03:48,989
something I really liked where

73
00:03:48,989 --> 00:03:52,750
it would actually allow you to have
granular privacy settings for how you

74
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:54,060
display your gender to people

75
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:57,629
and they did that because users
complained about it and they listened

76
00:03:57,629 --> 00:04:00,900
and they provided feedback which is one
of the reasons I saw that only

77
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:04,700
awesome because respondent actually
doing things about what people think

78
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:09,159
and maybe they would listen to other
things unfortunately it wasn't the case

79
00:04:09,159 --> 00:04:12,650
but it was really pretty and answered a
lot of questions

80
00:04:12,650 --> 00:04:17,070
if fill the gap that I needed and it was
awesome and then this happened and like

81
00:04:17,070 --> 00:04:20,839
what the fuck my account got suspended
and

82
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:24,820
this is a little strange and one thing I
want to point out

83
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:27,820
if you see like right there it says
community standards on the sides after

84
00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:29,040
reviewing your profile

85
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:32,780
term name a provided by a large
community standards that was actually a

86
00:04:32,780 --> 00:04:34,440
dead like a 404

87
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:38,600
are on their initial policy but this
coming to ask the question

88
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:42,340
what is identity because I was trying to
figure out what they had this real names

89
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:43,190
policy

90
00:04:43,190 --> 00:04:46,690
well what does that actually mean so I
googled it right

91
00:04:46,690 --> 00:04:51,120
and I look to Google here's kinda the
definitions a Google had for me

92
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:56,470
are the first one is the fact or the be
and who or what a person or thing as

93
00:04:56,470 --> 00:04:59,860
that doesn't mean that much to me okay
the second one

94
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:03,820
the characteristics determining this
that's also an Armenian saying

95
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:09,280
I let's see tickets let see serving to
establish through the holder owner a.k.a

96
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:10,340
whatever

97
00:05:10,340 --> 00:05:14,759
for a close similarity or 30 so these
are all doing relations comparing

98
00:05:14,759 --> 00:05:16,259
objects to each other

99
00:05:16,259 --> 00:05:20,130
a.m. ok the last few RRR mathematical
thanks to my okay well

100
00:05:20,130 --> 00:05:23,680
Google doesn't seem to know well let's
see if I can ask people who are smarter

101
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:24,479
than me

102
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:29,389
so I i wept and there's a good quote
from Oscar Wilde that's a absolutely

103
00:05:29,389 --> 00:05:31,590
beautiful most people are other people

104
00:05:31,590 --> 00:05:34,699
their thoughts or someone else's
opinions their lives a mimicry their

105
00:05:34,699 --> 00:05:36,300
passions a quotation

106
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:40,180
interesting Chuck conduct the guy who
wrote Fight Club an invisible monsters

107
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:43,820
nothing at me is original and the
combined effort every 1 I've ever known

108
00:05:43,820 --> 00:05:47,380
may get some stuff from shakespeare we
know we are but not maybe

109
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:50,190
others Gandhi the best way to find
yourself is to lose yourself in the

110
00:05:50,190 --> 00:05:51,520
service of others

111
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:54,780
so all these things to me one thing

112
00:05:54,780 --> 00:06:00,289
these super smart people don't have a
clue what identity is either

113
00:06:00,289 --> 00:06:03,949
the beautiful quotes but they don't
really speak to me so I decided to start

114
00:06:03,949 --> 00:06:05,960
trying to figure it out for myself

115
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:09,159
so two things are that mean a lot to me
the first

116
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:13,220
is a Genesis thats pain to Nevada name
in the animals because

117
00:06:13,220 --> 00:06:16,819
course if you name something you hold a
degree of power over whatever the power

118
00:06:16,819 --> 00:06:18,490
relationship might be

119
00:06:18,490 --> 00:06:22,270
on the second of course is a the idea of
the royal seal

120
00:06:22,270 --> 00:06:26,000
and that serves multiple purposes one
you know comes from the king the other

121
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:31,440
it validates things are you has been
tampered with you know is this your

122
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:34,449
this document which contains my title
which the King has granted me and I can

123
00:06:34,449 --> 00:06:36,190
produce this that's your which

124
00:06:36,190 --> 00:06:40,259
once you break it different ways

125
00:06:40,259 --> 00:06:44,520
establish identity and the thing that I
want to point out one other one of the

126
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:45,210
core elements

127
00:06:45,210 --> 00:06:48,860
identity is not the same thing as a name
identity is a much bigger much more

128
00:06:48,860 --> 00:06:50,580
nebulous concept

129
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:54,810
name I am to finance my own personal
definition if anyone has an addendum

130
00:06:54,810 --> 00:06:59,289
or change in the definition I i'm open
do listen and discussion that

131
00:06:59,289 --> 00:07:03,360
a label that is used to identify a
person thing or concept within a given

132
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:04,590
context

133
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:08,169
so water contracts

134
00:07:08,169 --> 00:07:12,090
here a few examples of contacts and this
is a

135
00:07:12,090 --> 00:07:16,449
its kinda novelists 01 ideas within a
certain group so everyone I hope is

136
00:07:16,449 --> 00:07:16,910
within

137
00:07:16,910 --> 00:07:20,289
kinda the set people who are hopeful
that some people leave early it's

138
00:07:20,289 --> 00:07:23,539
very schedules and whatever if you work
at a company

139
00:07:23,539 --> 00:07:26,889
then all your coworkers there is a
context and identity you have most of

140
00:07:26,889 --> 00:07:28,590
them insured relationships

141
00:07:28,590 --> 00:07:31,949
if year you know the staff have
something if you're in a location of

142
00:07:31,949 --> 00:07:33,620
your specific time

143
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:36,780
one other things is really interesting
as you get more and more granular it

144
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:37,400
gets tricky

145
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:40,949
you're so for example I say your
specific time and i say more time but I

146
00:07:40,949 --> 00:07:42,009
don't say when

147
00:07:42,009 --> 00:07:46,590
so the morning it could be between 6
a.m. and 9 a.m. or something like that

148
00:07:46,590 --> 00:07:50,270
9 p.m. I don't say what time zone and
last week that could mean any day last

149
00:07:50,270 --> 00:07:53,068
week the communion tired yet last week

150
00:07:53,069 --> 00:07:56,729
an interest a jewel-like space bar

151
00:07:56,729 --> 00:07:59,250
that means that is very different from
the Joe who likes hockey and then

152
00:07:59,250 --> 00:08:02,310
suddenly we're getting things like
interest tax and things their use

153
00:08:02,310 --> 00:08:06,110
both to join people together as well as
things it continues to differentiate so

154
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:10,340
you have to choose one who likes
baseball one who likes hockey

155
00:08:10,340 --> 00:08:13,410
and that means that can be multiple
people who are culture which means that

156
00:08:13,410 --> 00:08:17,139
all these different types of context
establish much greater sense of what

157
00:08:17,139 --> 00:08:19,610
identity is

158
00:08:19,610 --> 00:08:22,660
so this begins to get a bit more
philosophical on the question of course

159
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:23,680
is is identity

160
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:27,810
internal and external are one of the
most important questions I have here

161
00:08:27,810 --> 00:08:30,940
a anyone here familiar freud

162
00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:34,208
a few people morning occur so

163
00:08:34,209 --> 00:08:38,570
traders the idea the ego and superego
that is the kernel the peace matru

164
00:08:38,570 --> 00:08:42,240
man as well as the intellect that the
Prime all and then

165
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:45,700
the superego which is the the community
the relationships that you share with

166
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:46,630
each other

167
00:08:46,630 --> 00:08:51,019
and its it's it's really interesting cuz
you ask yourself what drives us

168
00:08:51,019 --> 00:08:54,750
is is it the nature like what what
establishes human nature is at the end

169
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:58,390
triumphing over the beast within us is a
two piece coming out allowing us to

170
00:08:58,390 --> 00:09:00,430
conquer things that would otherwise fall
this pack

171
00:09:00,430 --> 00:09:04,940
or is that the people around us who
encourage us and collaborate with us

172
00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:08,649
and missed them gets into the idea
reputation which them gets into the idea

173
00:09:08,649 --> 00:09:12,100
trust are so has anyone here seen
Citizen Kane

174
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:16,769
from thirties ok good good okay by Orson
Welles II love this movie and I love

175
00:09:16,769 --> 00:09:18,269
this example because

176
00:09:18,269 --> 00:09:21,940
citizen can the concept to the movie the
main character dies and again in the

177
00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:22,470
movie

178
00:09:22,470 --> 00:09:26,330
so the entire the movie is actually
interviewing all these different people

179
00:09:26,330 --> 00:09:30,089
who knew him trying to construct from
their perceptions from their viewpoints

180
00:09:30,089 --> 00:09:31,399
and opinions of him

181
00:09:31,399 --> 00:09:34,930
who he actually was as you perform
effectively getting the integral

182
00:09:34,930 --> 00:09:39,100
his persona and trying to establish who
he was some people might really like him

183
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:42,300
some people hate him people different
relationships to Hannah

184
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:45,850
begins at least to me to establish the
mean at the internal versus external

185
00:09:45,850 --> 00:09:47,690
relations

186
00:09:47,690 --> 00:09:52,459
and then on top of that I just a Oscar
Wilde is great the only thing worse than

187
00:09:52,459 --> 00:09:54,750
being talked about is not being talked
about

188
00:09:54,750 --> 00:10:00,010
wannamaker books so the conclusions that
are drawn from some in this preliminary

189
00:10:00,010 --> 00:10:01,240
research

190
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:04,660
is that the meaning and identity is so
complex that neither Shakespeare in

191
00:10:04,660 --> 00:10:08,089
oregon you can define and those guys
early smart

192
00:10:08,089 --> 00:10:11,149
and identity by its very nature is
multifaceted

193
00:10:11,149 --> 00:10:15,500
sons identity is context-dependent no
person has one single identity

194
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:18,490
and that's one of the key points in one
of the few season this whole talking all

195
00:10:18,490 --> 00:10:20,200
getting the summer that stuff later

196
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:24,209
but I i think that's one of the points
where a lot at the technical

197
00:10:24,209 --> 00:10:26,690
implementations I understand their
security

198
00:10:26,690 --> 00:10:29,910
measures that they're keeping in mind
but

199
00:10:29,910 --> 00:10:33,180
if you really want to start to capture
identity and capture relationships you

200
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:35,360
have to think it through more

201
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:38,560
so let's take a look at what different
kinds of names there are

202
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:41,950
and this is just like a quick list that
I came up with so if your birth

203
00:10:41,950 --> 00:10:43,940
certificate or the given them

204
00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:47,589
you have a legal name or Scott who is
involved in or is called

205
00:10:47,589 --> 00:10:50,990
the wall and the one that you keep money
you know whatever your drivers licence

206
00:10:50,990 --> 00:10:56,029
documents the government issued ID so
you license or passport or social

207
00:10:56,029 --> 00:10:59,310
it all these two nineties and everything
else

208
00:10:59,310 --> 00:11:02,620
one of the things I want to point out
about all these is that

209
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:06,120
they can all be real like I'll be
completely after describing who you are

210
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:07,209
and legitimate

211
00:11:07,209 --> 00:11:11,610
and they can all be completely different
at the same time so is the example here

212
00:11:11,610 --> 00:11:12,480
imagined

213
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:16,180
you have a driver's license and passport
many get married changer net

214
00:11:16,180 --> 00:11:19,180
suddenly your driver's license has a
different last name on it yet both your

215
00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:20,560
driver's license or passport

216
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:25,070
are still no perfectly legal documents
or if you're a doctor so your employee

217
00:11:25,070 --> 00:11:27,720
ID says you know doctor on or something
like that

218
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:31,000
and that gets into questions tech
implementation trying to do stringer

219
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,920
mission and that that causes problems
that say the airline principal boarding

220
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:37,860
pass for you but they screw up so
there's not a space between your first

221
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:39,070
your last name

222
00:11:39,070 --> 00:11:43,560
I ran into the supporter patrol once

223
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:47,870
different types of names that this is
where there's a lot of confusion sure

224
00:11:47,870 --> 00:11:51,190
I'm actually gonna get to a point where
I i've actually concludes now that I

225
00:11:51,190 --> 00:11:53,800
reject the notion of a student I'll get
to that

226
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:57,029
but for now it's II define a pseudonym

227
00:11:57,029 --> 00:12:00,220
more as a number too much is to me a
much more elegant and beautiful would

228
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:01,130
describe it

229
00:12:01,130 --> 00:12:04,579
a name that is not found any those
previously mentioned documents

230
00:12:04,579 --> 00:12:07,769
and it might even not even be linkable
to a document

231
00:12:07,769 --> 00:12:11,839
appalling him as a name a multiple words
so say Charles Foster Kane

232
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:16,339
from citizen cam a monomers in a min
just one word so maybe just Charles

233
00:12:16,339 --> 00:12:21,440
an AOM is a name which represent him
anonymity

234
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:25,029
it's actually kinda debatable whether
anonymity exists at all

235
00:12:25,029 --> 00:12:28,700
it that is II wanna try very important
distinction here though there's a very

236
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:31,019
big difference between an Indian
pseudonym any

237
00:12:31,019 --> 00:12:34,850
and I think a lot of people don't
understand a pseudonym

238
00:12:34,850 --> 00:12:38,410
is actually something which is
identifying to you and anonymity is

239
00:12:38,410 --> 00:12:42,819
attempting to go without any and we'll
get into that morning but

240
00:12:42,820 --> 00:12:46,750
so anyone recognize any the figures on
the smaller

241
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:51,769
Jess okay cool so that some for Norton
on the right over to him in a second

242
00:12:51,769 --> 00:12:52,649
she's awesome

243
00:12:52,649 --> 00:12:57,170
I at the top with Google yes who is the
author the Federalist Papers

244
00:12:57,170 --> 00:13:00,720
basically it was actually John J
Alexander Hamilton and a

245
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:04,610
one other Hosford what thomas jefferson
thank you

246
00:13:04,610 --> 00:13:07,200
read the federalist papers they were
trying to get the constitution

247
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:10,529
effectively ratified have the whole
federalist movement and whatnot

248
00:13:10,529 --> 00:13:14,430
an in order to convince everyone they
began publishing the series of papers

249
00:13:14,430 --> 00:13:15,490
and articles

250
00:13:15,490 --> 00:13:19,010
I in newspapers under the name true
bliss over there there were three of

251
00:13:19,010 --> 00:13:21,819
them right and people didn't know who it
actually was the head than in previous

252
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:23,110
attached to it

253
00:13:23,110 --> 00:13:27,240
therefore any context relationships that
they may have had any biases against

254
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:28,790
them based on the name

255
00:13:28,790 --> 00:13:33,260
was gone and you know there was also the
Anti Federalist Papers which was you

256
00:13:33,260 --> 00:13:35,639
know against the constitution and other
things

257
00:13:35,639 --> 00:13:39,230
but I was just very interesting that the
idea that the name could influence thing

258
00:13:39,230 --> 00:13:41,170
so much they tried to it

259
00:13:41,170 --> 00:13:45,160
effectively published under the
pseudonym one of my favorites as Emperor

260
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:46,740
Norton the first

261
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:50,730
if anyone's rights and man sweet

262
00:13:50,730 --> 00:13:55,260
yet his famous in San Francisco or he
was in San Francisco and I think the

263
00:13:55,260 --> 00:13:59,060
mid to late eighteen hundreds she was a

264
00:13:59,060 --> 00:14:03,370
he was doing something in the trade and
the economy takes her he lost a lotta

265
00:14:03,370 --> 00:14:05,529
money and you want broken kinda once an

266
00:14:05,529 --> 00:14:08,649
declared himself the upper the United
States and protector Mexico

267
00:14:08,649 --> 00:14:12,220
sent a letter the San Francisco
Chronicle and cuz its Bay Area

268
00:14:12,220 --> 00:14:16,430
everyone went along with it so there he
is in his ear

269
00:14:16,430 --> 00:14:19,560
formal you know that his Majesty's here
and the

270
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:22,600
the best for us you actually issued his
own currency in stores took it

271
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:25,810
so yeah he is also I wanted the

272
00:14:25,810 --> 00:14:30,990
PSN service discordance so Nicolas
Bourbaki wear them

273
00:14:30,990 --> 00:14:34,949
up korea of course you have your
mathematician

274
00:14:34,949 --> 00:14:38,410
was in the nineteen thirties it was a
group love I think French mathematicians

275
00:14:38,410 --> 00:14:40,920
who tried to rewrite mathematics from
the ground up

276
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:44,670
and all other work that published under
the name Nicolas Bourbaki

277
00:14:44,670 --> 00:14:47,760
which is really really mean that there's
a number of reasons it was kind of a

278
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:51,899
secret society type thing and the there
was a bunch of stuff going on there but

279
00:14:51,899 --> 00:14:55,970
very fast now the holder peoples of
publishing under single name like that

280
00:14:55,970 --> 00:14:59,690
other instances were pseudonyms are
numbed up limbs as I call them are

281
00:14:59,690 --> 00:15:00,730
incredibly useful

282
00:15:00,730 --> 00:15:03,889
Richard Bachman aka a stephen king he
tried to publish under different names

283
00:15:03,889 --> 00:15:04,889
he helped

284
00:15:04,889 --> 00:15:08,320
level terror who publish kind you'd
under pseudonym partly because the King

285
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:11,410
of France wanted to kill whoever wrote
that book

286
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:15,389
yeah the bronte sisters who actually
published there a workshop was a trial

287
00:15:15,389 --> 00:15:17,190
in memory I think they publish their
work

288
00:15:17,190 --> 00:15:20,320
under a mail them because they couldn't
get published because they were women

289
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:23,790
many many other examples of why synonyms
are important

290
00:15:23,790 --> 00:15:28,790
NY people have used in the past those
are just a few a.m.

291
00:15:28,790 --> 00:15:32,500
so here's here's a quick example the I
don't know if anyone remembers this that

292
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:33,480
this is all a bit too

293
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:36,860
because this was from last year up some
plus he stopped the but

294
00:15:36,860 --> 00:15:40,680
this was a pendulum at the time had at
one point seven million Twitter

295
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:41,690
followers

296
00:15:41,690 --> 00:15:45,009
and he had this beautiful quote he
posted on Twitter from MLK

297
00:15:45,009 --> 00:15:49,040
I mourn the loss a thousands of precious
lives but I will read not rejoice in the

298
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:51,259
death of one that not even an enemy

299
00:15:51,259 --> 00:15:56,829
really really right only one problem it
wasn't by an OK

300
00:15:56,829 --> 00:16:01,089
and he issues this apology no I checked
along quote from márquez track to love

301
00:16:01,089 --> 00:16:01,480
them

302
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:05,810
that spoke to sum up my feelings like
%uh piston alter talking apologize

303
00:16:05,810 --> 00:16:08,509
one other interesting I wanna thing I
want to point out during the first

304
00:16:08,509 --> 00:16:11,490
encounter that we have with how this
works with m.tech

305
00:16:11,490 --> 00:16:14,910
notice at the bottom into how you well
you can see I see how it says re tweeted

306
00:16:14,910 --> 00:16:15,310
to

307
00:16:15,310 --> 00:16:19,449
by somebody and 50 others so this the
apology I'll go back to slide

308
00:16:19,449 --> 00:16:23,300
this one says re tweeted by one hundred
plus others

309
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:26,459
so it's really interesting that somebody
creeks themselves

310
00:16:26,459 --> 00:16:30,230
and sheeple didn't reach with the
correction as much

311
00:16:30,230 --> 00:16:33,589
so there's other number questions is why
did it maybe it should have been news

312
00:16:33,589 --> 00:16:35,790
articles on it and feel the need to re
tweeted

313
00:16:35,790 --> 00:16:38,699
maybe they felt personally guilty
because they were dumb enough to reach

314
00:16:38,699 --> 00:16:39,980
with something that was

315
00:16:39,980 --> 00:16:45,199
like inaccurate to begin with but we'll
get into that

316
00:16:45,199 --> 00:16:49,980
so wanted to just quickly dive into some
solid examples hereof

317
00:16:49,980 --> 00:16:54,600
where names really the question is do
names matter or did they not matter in

318
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:56,470
terms of establishing identity

319
00:16:56,470 --> 00:17:00,050
is there anyone here has not heard with
you X one love

320
00:17:00,050 --> 00:17:03,579
okay you don't belong here

321
00:17:03,579 --> 00:17:08,370
one other things kid a pic everyone has
their own opinion on the %uh the topic

322
00:17:08,370 --> 00:17:09,929
in the tobacco and whatnot but

323
00:17:09,929 --> 00:17:14,730
one thing the asana said that I i found
a really really interesting he said

324
00:17:14,730 --> 00:17:19,179
that the source material does not matter
does the content that matters in the

325
00:17:19,179 --> 00:17:22,189
ideas that are out there and let which
is one of the reasons they try to

326
00:17:22,189 --> 00:17:24,429
separate the source from the material

327
00:17:24,429 --> 00:17:28,470
the idea being that the source combines
them the source candy legitimize things

328
00:17:28,470 --> 00:17:31,200
or religion a nice things and he wanted
the content

329
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:36,750
to effectively little live up in be
validated on its own accord

330
00:17:36,750 --> 00:17:40,820
and that brings the question a do we

331
00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:44,389
lend credibility to things to invalidate
things based on who said it

332
00:17:44,390 --> 00:17:48,240
or based on the thing itself based on we
read a book because

333
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:51,100
it's a good book or do we read it
because we wanna think it's good because

334
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:54,780
we read another book by that author
because we heard author was great

335
00:17:54,780 --> 00:17:58,070
didn't hear about porn WikiLeaks so

336
00:17:58,070 --> 00:18:01,950
porn wiki leaks this happened last year
the adult film industry has this thing

337
00:18:01,950 --> 00:18:03,980
called the adult information

338
00:18:03,980 --> 00:18:08,890
was the AI a dole information medical
data viz were all the adult film actors

339
00:18:08,890 --> 00:18:12,450
and actresses submit blood test scores
Lena HIV test results and things like

340
00:18:12,450 --> 00:18:14,780
this it was kept in a centralized
database

341
00:18:14,780 --> 00:18:19,760
and it was compromised and a site went
up last year it was taken down by the

342
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:22,220
FBI when the few takedowns and actually
okay with

343
00:18:22,220 --> 00:18:27,059
which had the entire database that was
map in stage names upon people

344
00:18:27,059 --> 00:18:30,760
to their legal names I call them and in
some cases

345
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:34,470
had driver's licenses and things like
that and had a lot of other information

346
00:18:34,470 --> 00:18:35,809
and anyone who has ever

347
00:18:35,809 --> 00:18:39,470
even dastan that ranking told why that
would be really really damn in dangerous

348
00:18:39,470 --> 00:18:40,160
you know Kors

349
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:44,030
imagine your driver's license has your
old home monitor your parents leave that

350
00:18:44,030 --> 00:18:46,460
in one day and it catches up on their
doorstep

351
00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:50,610
that kinda stuff does happen so that
something to keep in mind that's that's

352
00:18:50,610 --> 00:18:51,890
one of the reasons that

353
00:18:51,890 --> 00:18:54,710
multiple identities can be very useful
because you have all these different

354
00:18:54,710 --> 00:18:55,600
contexts in

355
00:18:55,600 --> 00:19:00,450
people in one context might not
appreciate people in another context

356
00:19:00,450 --> 00:19:04,530
another example slightly less trigger an
alarm in was a

357
00:19:04,530 --> 00:19:08,160
a lil and Netflix databases things like
that that anyone keep up with this is a

358
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:09,340
few years ago so

359
00:19:09,340 --> 00:19:12,870
the air while database that they are
released a record

360
00:19:12,870 --> 00:19:15,980
II couple hundred thousand I think
search logs

361
00:19:15,980 --> 00:19:19,520
and based on the searchers those people
were actually able to reconstruct

362
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:22,980
by virtue of just the searches in the
order in which is the did them

363
00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:26,580
what the other sure the identity of the
people that did the searches were

364
00:19:26,580 --> 00:19:30,189
on Netflix ran into something like this:
based on the ratings at movies & movies

365
00:19:30,190 --> 00:19:30,840
or watch

366
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:33,959
and they were able to reconstruct to
wasn't construct the social grab some

367
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:35,240
things like that

368
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:39,960
on there is also urges anybody remember
the Wikipedia stir controversy

369
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:44,250
backing this was and I think 2006 there
was a

370
00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:48,919
there was a a guy who was on the wiki
pedia he was actually fairly high level

371
00:19:48,919 --> 00:19:51,390
editor he was making a number a person

372
00:19:51,390 --> 00:19:54,870
he claimed that he had to I think two
degrees one in divinity and maybe one

373
00:19:54,870 --> 00:19:55,679
and shit

374
00:19:55,679 --> 00:19:59,080
jurors prudence or something like that
and the

375
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:02,760
he was involved in all the stupid people
took him seriously and it turned out

376
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:05,669
that it was actually I think a
22-year-old college dropout living in

377
00:20:05,669 --> 00:20:09,620
Louisville Kentucky

378
00:20:09,620 --> 00:20:13,929
and it's it's just people took it
seriously and its late well maybe she

379
00:20:13,929 --> 00:20:15,130
really was that smart

380
00:20:15,130 --> 00:20:18,169
if you don't it would actually as you
take a piss on the content they produce

381
00:20:18,169 --> 00:20:18,830
and the

382
00:20:18,830 --> 00:20:22,070
discussions that they have and you
compare that somebody else

383
00:20:22,070 --> 00:20:24,809
who actually does have those credentials
makes you start to ask but the point

384
00:20:24,809 --> 00:20:26,620
occurred angelos

385
00:20:26,620 --> 00:20:30,230
so I wanna step back option

386
00:20:30,230 --> 00:20:33,350
I want to step back for a moment and I
just explore just different types of

387
00:20:33,350 --> 00:20:36,419
social networks because we're looking at
interests in common

388
00:20:36,419 --> 00:20:39,640
links before an I think that all these
conserve is a

389
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:44,190
social networks and summit is a fairly
obvious your book group of corporations

390
00:20:44,190 --> 00:20:46,840
so everyone who works at a company
together

391
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:50,820
you have the facts and offensive course
are limited by time and some events

392
00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:54,250
might last week and within that week
it's kinda temperate on a zone in which

393
00:20:54,250 --> 00:20:57,990
you know the The Social Network has
created an expires in a maybe

394
00:20:57,990 --> 00:21:00,100
relationships will happen later on

395
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:03,120
on courtrooms at this is this is
interesting because

396
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:06,950
the other thing that happens a social
networks not only to relationships

397
00:21:06,950 --> 00:21:10,830
develop for people also assume roles
within those relationships

398
00:21:10,830 --> 00:21:14,789
so courtrooms an easy example some you
have a what were the rules you have the

399
00:21:14,789 --> 00:21:16,090
judge you have the jury

400
00:21:16,090 --> 00:21:19,539
you're the prosecutor yet the defendant
you all the deferrals

401
00:21:19,539 --> 00:21:23,280
well the regular people when they leave
the courthouse right

402
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:26,760
you have lunch with them and talk about
it on google or something like that

403
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:29,830
it's one that has stepped into that
social network in the context of the

404
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:30,620
courtroom

405
00:21:30,620 --> 00:21:36,250
that they assume the skills the the
roles that are ascribed to those titles

406
00:21:36,250 --> 00:21:39,309
when you call somebody something it can
often change how they act to you

407
00:21:39,309 --> 00:21:43,059
so I'm a and other things that you have
a cost people get together because

408
00:21:43,059 --> 00:21:47,030
they want to help support something like
gonna stop in breast cancer things like

409
00:21:47,030 --> 00:21:49,490
that

410
00:21:49,490 --> 00:21:52,260
so this this is just something to think
about a happy to go into more detail

411
00:21:52,260 --> 00:21:53,830
than it is later

412
00:21:53,830 --> 00:21:57,158
so I'm trying to define here at least
two social network is a force that

413
00:21:57,159 --> 00:21:58,770
brings people together our people

414
00:21:58,770 --> 00:22:02,200
or their personas that's very fast track
is that means that

415
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:05,830
you don't actually have to be in flesh
meeting with them and their personas

416
00:22:05,830 --> 00:22:07,600
together on a regular basis

417
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:11,010
a friend is a person that you would
shoes

418
00:22:11,010 --> 00:22:14,850
to be in contact with and that gets
really interesting because you may feel

419
00:22:14,850 --> 00:22:18,100
like you have a relation to somebody
because you follow them on Twitter maybe

420
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:20,860
you've never met the maybe you've never
had a back-and-forth

421
00:22:20,860 --> 00:22:24,880
communication with them but you still
consider them to be part of your network

422
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:29,510
but they wouldn't be a friend and I
meant to find friends here is something

423
00:22:29,510 --> 00:22:33,330
it's all really nebulous so social
networks

424
00:22:33,330 --> 00:22:37,289
I II escribe them has been this context
systems basically try to help solve

425
00:22:37,289 --> 00:22:38,510
namespace collisions

426
00:22:38,510 --> 00:22:42,179
her it all good and examples

427
00:22:42,179 --> 00:22:47,130
so a couple uva more technical things I
want to cover legal kind words

428
00:22:47,130 --> 00:22:50,690
are interpersonal versus interpersonal
communication

429
00:22:50,690 --> 00:22:54,110
in shop personal is the internal
dialogue you have with yourself

430
00:22:54,110 --> 00:22:57,179
your conscious and you're thinking
through things and whatnot

431
00:22:57,179 --> 00:23:00,840
your interpersonal his conversations and
relations you have with each other with

432
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:01,860
other people so

433
00:23:01,860 --> 00:23:07,860
internal versus external in that sense
are anyone here know that numbers number

434
00:23:07,860 --> 00:23:11,880
of Los a doctor robin number did a study
and 1992

435
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:16,390
looked over among other sting studied
the sizeof primates third their brains

436
00:23:16,390 --> 00:23:19,950
Anna looked and found a direct
correlation between the size the brand's

437
00:23:19,950 --> 00:23:23,630
and the size that the social group that
they meant and and actually did some

438
00:23:23,630 --> 00:23:24,880
mathematics and found that the

439
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:29,929
us Homo sapiens sapiens tend to have a
an average social group size about

440
00:23:29,929 --> 00:23:33,640
it's usually run it around a hundred and
fifty that the number changes and

441
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:37,330
there's a number the third debate as to
but what the number might actually be

442
00:23:37,330 --> 00:23:40,240
and I think it may change based on who
it is

443
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:43,860
so doctor cammermeyer loaded a follow-up
study with Facebook in 2009

444
00:23:43,860 --> 00:23:47,409
and actually found that the number a
friend somebody has on Facebook

445
00:23:47,409 --> 00:23:50,809
by which I mean the number people they
actively communicate with and seem to

446
00:23:50,809 --> 00:23:51,760
know

447
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:55,200
usually range from 0 to 120 to 150 and

448
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:59,539
also those people tend to have us a
smaller close circle of friends usually

449
00:23:59,539 --> 00:24:03,960
between five and 7i think the numbers
are

450
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:07,289
so this is one of the key points at the
whole talking this is I could actually

451
00:24:07,289 --> 00:24:08,990
get an entire talk just on this

452
00:24:08,990 --> 00:24:12,840
hands through your nose at the Joseph
Campbell is was ships

453
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:17,860
okay and this is how I'm going to start
to explore the hacker handles question

454
00:24:17,860 --> 00:24:18,690
why they matter

455
00:24:18,690 --> 00:24:21,980
so Joseph Campbell have a

456
00:24:21,980 --> 00:24:26,299
he is a famous mythologies he passed
away in the late eighties but

457
00:24:26,299 --> 00:24:31,059
he had this concept that he this is a
series of lectures as well as a boxer's

458
00:24:31,059 --> 00:24:31,639
was called me

459
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:35,289
those he also has a a interviews that he
did with bill moyers

460
00:24:35,289 --> 00:24:38,960
fascinating man he did some other the
most groundbreaking work I've ever seen

461
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:40,230
a mythology studies

462
00:24:40,230 --> 00:24:43,580
here's this idea that he he conveys
called the right hand path and left hand

463
00:24:43,580 --> 00:24:45,750
path a path that you go through life

464
00:24:45,750 --> 00:24:49,250
so the right-hand house just to give a
quick summary is

465
00:24:49,250 --> 00:24:53,220
the community from which you cops the
structure society in the norms in the

466
00:24:53,220 --> 00:24:55,230
cultural ideas that come with them

467
00:24:55,230 --> 00:24:58,970
the left hand path is more the Hero's
Journey type thing the person who splits

468
00:24:58,970 --> 00:25:01,740
often goes off and discovers things for
themselves

469
00:25:01,740 --> 00:25:06,150
and jurors journey has a number
different elements to it you have

470
00:25:06,150 --> 00:25:12,360
easy examples at this if it has anyone
here seen Star Wars

471
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:15,740
know okay only saw like two hands

472
00:25:15,740 --> 00:25:20,730
yeah um George Lucas credits a lot of
the thing can and to develop in Star

473
00:25:20,730 --> 00:25:23,710
Wars 2 Joseph Campbell and hero's
journey an altar

474
00:25:23,710 --> 00:25:27,640
if you've ever seen the matrix A follows
the same idea where A is there there's a

475
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:28,909
call to adventure the

476
00:25:28,909 --> 00:25:32,159
you can kinda see you there there's a
call to adventure the call to action or

477
00:25:32,159 --> 00:25:34,929
something quests yuppers neo gets into
the follow the right

478
00:25:34,929 --> 00:25:38,159
White Rabbit message and then along the
way you get all these challenges and if

479
00:25:38,159 --> 00:25:40,880
you respond to them and follow through
on carry through with them

480
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:45,270
its flexibility character in till at
some point you hit revelations and

481
00:25:45,270 --> 00:25:49,770
the whole idea this is basically going
through experiences and building after

482
00:25:49,770 --> 00:25:52,440
church in discovering who it is that you
actually are

483
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:55,650
and of course as we go through life it's
casa process and

484
00:25:55,650 --> 00:25:59,880
near the end your transformation where
you effectively take those ideas and

485
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:01,539
reintegrate them into yourself and then

486
00:26:01,539 --> 00:26:04,908
atonement where you come back you become
at one with yourself

487
00:26:04,909 --> 00:26:08,390
an the near-term doctor simplicity or
but you know you're the same person

488
00:26:08,390 --> 00:26:10,400
right

489
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:13,760
are you very different so

490
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:16,990
the right hand pass just reiterate right
hand path as structure

491
00:26:16,990 --> 00:26:20,190
the structure which is instilled in you
by society the left hand path is much

492
00:26:20,190 --> 00:26:21,390
more

493
00:26:21,390 --> 00:26:24,470
some people would describe it as the
chaos it's it's you wandering through it

494
00:26:24,470 --> 00:26:27,279
when you make mistakes and you learn
from them you build them back and

495
00:26:27,279 --> 00:26:32,179
on another interesting the point the top
part in that circle the known

496
00:26:32,179 --> 00:26:36,659
verses that the bottom hers the on so
this is part partly from Crawley on the

497
00:26:36,659 --> 00:26:37,710
idea of a

498
00:26:37,710 --> 00:26:42,090
the symbols and meanings within symbols
but you can also relate that the known

499
00:26:42,090 --> 00:26:42,940
as the word

500
00:26:42,940 --> 00:26:45,690
and the unknown is the meaning ascribed
to the word because you can't ever knew

501
00:26:45,690 --> 00:26:46,840
it fully somebody a

502
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:53,200
thanks a word means so a culture can
guess why hacker handles come into this

503
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:58,690
anyone what do you think

504
00:26:58,690 --> 00:27:02,720
they provide freedom yes so if you
consider hacker handle it's it's a name

505
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:04,929
that you don your soft pretzel given
them

506
00:27:04,929 --> 00:27:08,929
and maybe it's something that you do and
falling maybe hop on IRC for a minute

507
00:27:08,929 --> 00:27:09,630
news

508
00:27:09,630 --> 00:27:13,210
hang around in the nearly ever you
become a former hackers some people call

509
00:27:13,210 --> 00:27:14,570
it

510
00:27:14,570 --> 00:27:18,330
or you put your foot you put your toe in
the water in the field

511
00:27:18,330 --> 00:27:21,470
and then you put your whole foot in the
water and you feel it a bit more to come

512
00:27:21,470 --> 00:27:22,340
more customer that

513
00:27:22,340 --> 00:27:26,490
context and culture maybe you you know
Mitt maybe have

514
00:27:26,490 --> 00:27:30,210
a whole leg another and what you're
really doing in my opinion is a stepping

515
00:27:30,210 --> 00:27:32,730
into the paradigm in the context

516
00:27:32,730 --> 00:27:35,850
that tactic dynamic community house for
you so

517
00:27:35,850 --> 00:27:39,340
rather than as some people say the right
hand path the structure you're stepping

518
00:27:39,340 --> 00:27:42,779
outside up her Diamond stepping into a
new one which is of discovery im

519
00:27:42,779 --> 00:27:46,120
as you leave that culture discover that
other people from other cultures have

520
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:47,210
left

521
00:27:47,210 --> 00:27:50,100
but they haven't really left have that
they're still there there's part so that

522
00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:52,490
culture that are with them as they carry
on through

523
00:27:52,490 --> 00:27:55,490
and people who are laundry along
becoming themselves in part another

524
00:27:55,490 --> 00:27:56,710
culture

525
00:27:56,710 --> 00:28:00,279
so after Hamels of course

526
00:28:00,279 --> 00:28:04,140
if you don a name for folly well made me
we'll start a girl maybe you can use

527
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:05,419
that name too

528
00:28:05,419 --> 00:28:08,720
explorer who you are exploring new angle
it yourself

529
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:13,570
we'll get in this summer was and crisp
cool stuff in a moment but

530
00:28:13,570 --> 00:28:17,789
just to dwell on that for a moment
here's a quick example that I can use

531
00:28:17,789 --> 00:28:21,470
how many people have ever worn a tie to
work

532
00:28:21,470 --> 00:28:26,700
right you get treated a lot differently
than when you wear a t-shirt

533
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:30,000
and that's something the use in some
people feel you know they were more

534
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,140
expensive clothes in the act a different
way

535
00:28:32,140 --> 00:28:35,140
you convey different message it changes
the way the People Act you so

536
00:28:35,140 --> 00:28:38,789
the example that I've used in this is I
can introduce myself

537
00:28:38,789 --> 00:28:42,539
by my legal name and people treat me in
one way

538
00:28:42,539 --> 00:28:46,110
on shoes myself by a handle I get
written a very different way

539
00:28:46,110 --> 00:28:50,039
and allows me to step outside the
context I was in step into a new one

540
00:28:50,039 --> 00:28:53,840
and the fasten in a part about that some
things and still exploring right now

541
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:58,100
is that actually allows me to experience
life as somebody with fewer privileges

542
00:28:58,100 --> 00:29:01,960
and that becomes really interesting

543
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:05,409
so stepping back in attack from Aunt
bring an eternity online

544
00:29:05,409 --> 00:29:08,669
a.m. first example here is a

545
00:29:08,669 --> 00:29:12,299
Nissan dot com does anybody know that
this one sony Sony

546
00:29:12,299 --> 00:29:15,690
okay Nissan you think the car company
something like that right

547
00:29:15,690 --> 00:29:19,110
well turns out there's actually guys
family name is Nissan I had me some duck

548
00:29:19,110 --> 00:29:20,820
on a registered like 94

549
00:29:20,820 --> 00:29:25,168
and the yeah nissan has been fighting to
get the gist thats

550
00:29:25,169 --> 00:29:28,559
dude who owns a kid like computer repair
company effect and there's been

551
00:29:28,559 --> 00:29:31,830
ongoing lawsuits in the website actually
turn in a document in all the lawsuits

552
00:29:31,830 --> 00:29:34,260
from a Nissan trying to take the name
from

553
00:29:34,260 --> 00:29:37,820
up this is my favorite example here
White House dot com anyone remember this

554
00:29:37,820 --> 00:29:39,470
from the 90's

555
00:29:39,470 --> 00:29:42,580
yeah actually had to go to Internet
Archive to get that image

556
00:29:42,580 --> 00:29:46,529
mostly cuz I just wanted to show porn on
my talk

557
00:29:46,529 --> 00:29:50,529
door there's no go to hear just but
think about that for a second

558
00:29:50,529 --> 00:29:54,049
namespace issues because people expect
something wanna go somewhere so imagine

559
00:29:54,049 --> 00:29:54,658
the a

560
00:29:54,659 --> 00:29:58,309
around the elementary school teacher is
teaching the kids about computers and 95

561
00:29:58,309 --> 00:29:58,820
in a good

562
00:29:58,820 --> 00:30:02,470
let's go see what the president's oh my
god

563
00:30:02,470 --> 00:30:06,260
and cybersquatting just find a quick
definition is when I ate say I register

564
00:30:06,260 --> 00:30:09,720
Tom Cruise dot com in church Tom Cruise
a million dollars for it

565
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:14,419
and the kids in the legal stuff too a to
act technical again for a bit

566
00:30:14,419 --> 00:30:18,890
just provide context like what online
identity actually is

567
00:30:18,890 --> 00:30:22,179
HTTP headers and all these different
things looking at access times which

568
00:30:22,179 --> 00:30:24,299
URL's you access things like that

569
00:30:24,299 --> 00:30:28,120
without knowing any name or anything
like that just like with bennies cannot

570
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:29,140
where he said the name is

571
00:30:29,140 --> 00:30:33,120
least reliable way to identify someone
look at their access times look at the

572
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:34,870
world access things like that

573
00:30:34,870 --> 00:30:37,950
what if they try to access something to
make it tonight and they try to access a

574
00:30:37,950 --> 00:30:39,210
minute later again and asks

575
00:30:39,210 --> 00:30:42,620
except maybe they had to log in: maybe
it was them

576
00:30:42,620 --> 00:30:46,100
first time they just got my cuz I
haven't logged in yet access times you

577
00:30:46,100 --> 00:30:49,159
can take a look at you know a lot of
people do things from a 925

578
00:30:49,159 --> 00:30:52,190
but where is that night if I what time
zone it is and you can actually look at

579
00:30:52,190 --> 00:30:55,159
race is the final times on Mauer's
coming from

580
00:30:55,159 --> 00:30:59,630
on some other so I think you were prolly
covered some other stuff and her talk

581
00:30:59,630 --> 00:31:04,559
IP addresses that's you have an IP
address but if you're part of a

582
00:31:04,559 --> 00:31:07,799
corporation the corporation has one
external IP address that everyone can

583
00:31:07,799 --> 00:31:08,399
see

584
00:31:08,399 --> 00:31:11,799
well it's kinda hard to determine which
person that 10,000 person corporation

585
00:31:11,799 --> 00:31:15,289
is so then there's other additional
questions like how can a website

586
00:31:15,289 --> 00:31:18,529
confirming you are you and this is a
really hard questions like do we do

587
00:31:18,529 --> 00:31:20,799
passwords if so what kinda passwords or
other

588
00:31:20,799 --> 00:31:23,889
do we have captures our what if captured
its broken

589
00:31:23,890 --> 00:31:28,330
what if we get spammed things like that
what does it matter

590
00:31:28,330 --> 00:31:31,418
so I'm a all up in this one with the
quick question

591
00:31:31,419 --> 00:31:35,950
occurs that this gets and transparency
in privacy and everything else

592
00:31:35,950 --> 00:31:40,630
how many people here hands up have a a
Facebook account

593
00:31:40,630 --> 00:31:44,269
okay people keep your hands up answer

594
00:31:44,269 --> 00:31:47,440
how many of you have your jobs posted on
Facebook

595
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:51,070
okay how many of you have your salary
posted

596
00:31:51,070 --> 00:31:55,269
right so what is transparency actually
mean what elements over solves

597
00:31:55,269 --> 00:31:59,090
are we put in outer most people I know
don't wanna share their salary although

598
00:31:59,090 --> 00:32:02,419
if you're working for a nonprofit or the
government's public

599
00:32:02,419 --> 00:32:05,510
and that gets into some other things but
that then we have the question is there

600
00:32:05,510 --> 00:32:09,260
such thing as a full transparency do you
wanna sex tape yourself to be put online

601
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:13,309
who was it that you wanna grab that
access to an most importantly

602
00:32:13,309 --> 00:32:16,549
who decides how transparent we get to be
and

603
00:32:16,549 --> 00:32:19,740
this goes back into the Google+ stuff a
little bit goes back into the Facebook

604
00:32:19,740 --> 00:32:22,679
stuff goes back into the government
stuff

605
00:32:22,679 --> 00:32:27,070
who decides to you decided as a
government decide for you so I'm on

606
00:32:27,070 --> 00:32:31,269
final point here active versus passive
communication of that information

607
00:32:31,269 --> 00:32:34,980
so the example I can use here you
broadcast media were here

608
00:32:34,980 --> 00:32:38,039
put put in something out a newsletter
and all these people receive it

609
00:32:38,039 --> 00:32:41,379
you know they get emails or whatever
else it gets on CNN passive

610
00:32:41,380 --> 00:32:44,029
communication is when that information
is available

611
00:32:44,029 --> 00:32:47,779
but you kinda have to ask for it is just
a sample this is a for a request

612
00:32:47,779 --> 00:32:50,960
he sent a request for the cover for that
information is technically public it's

613
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:53,450
technically transparent automatically
you're free to get it

614
00:32:53,450 --> 00:32:57,220
and they're certainly got not gonna put
that out there

615
00:32:57,220 --> 00:33:01,830
so here just a some privacy promote
intact that works on all issues in TOR

616
00:33:01,830 --> 00:33:05,490
The Onion Router allows you to use the
web anonymously

617
00:33:05,490 --> 00:33:08,649
using selective logging you can turn off
login within your servers

618
00:33:08,649 --> 00:33:12,870
a privacy insuring on web sites things
like that which

619
00:33:12,870 --> 00:33:16,809
you know do I want my gender Shana
people re mailers that that is basically

620
00:33:16,809 --> 00:33:18,230
if I send an email

621
00:33:18,230 --> 00:33:21,399
to a somebody but it goes to three
Millers it just kinda them and the

622
00:33:21,399 --> 00:33:23,909
Middle strips all the headers from it
and forwards effectively

623
00:33:23,909 --> 00:33:27,080
the car to the message without sure was
that center and

624
00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:30,600
I have hilarious here because it's at
this Korean saying but it's also because

625
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:32,149
once ass man was the maintainer

626
00:33:32,149 --> 00:33:35,899
Mixmaster which was another email urs
and he unfortunately passed away last

627
00:33:35,899 --> 00:33:39,390
year so I wanted to make sure I had
something I remember him there

628
00:33:39,390 --> 00:33:42,600
so as weirdest looking at all the same
here under

629
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:47,210
well here so the problems we go with
online identity a sock puppets are when

630
00:33:47,210 --> 00:33:50,580
people create accounts as happens in
Wikipedia like you create an account to

631
00:33:50,580 --> 00:33:53,019
do with the little one of a kind to do
something

632
00:33:53,019 --> 00:33:56,610
but then you can create another one of
account a lot of mail where does the

633
00:33:56,610 --> 00:33:59,059
sofa tries to

634
00:33:59,059 --> 00:34:03,840
China thing coveted up so read it as a
place where this happened some recruits

635
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:05,919
attempt count does something to try to
you know up

636
00:34:05,919 --> 00:34:09,800
things are things like that anonymous
coward this comes from Slashdot back in

637
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:12,010
the 90's where somebody didn't want to
post under

638
00:34:12,010 --> 00:34:16,280
either their real name or there you know
Hannah whatever their reason must

639
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:18,440
because they didn't want i back to them

640
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:21,679
an sometimes who will post very
different things if they have the

641
00:34:21,679 --> 00:34:24,060
anonymity of knowing it won't come back
to them

642
00:34:24,060 --> 00:34:28,540
I don't think it's always malicious
cyberstalking it's very tricky

643
00:34:28,540 --> 00:34:31,719
other are definite reasons why people
need to use

644
00:34:31,720 --> 00:34:34,909
a Hamels are pseudonyms are numb clues
sons or whatever

645
00:34:34,909 --> 00:34:38,119
mention if you have a stalker imagine
someone is trying to kill you what is a

646
00:34:38,119 --> 00:34:40,500
witness protection program exist

647
00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:44,379
other new things like to DoS attacks in
that gets back in IP addresses and it's

648
00:34:44,379 --> 00:34:46,168
more technical but it's like well

649
00:34:46,168 --> 00:34:49,839
how do you keep out somebody who is
causing problems which is the basal what

650
00:34:49,839 --> 00:34:51,918
that is

651
00:34:51,918 --> 00:34:55,779
so here's a couple questions re: I'm so
here's a couple quotes this one is from

652
00:34:55,780 --> 00:34:56,579
Eric Schmidt

653
00:34:56,579 --> 00:35:01,400
executive chairman former CEO of Google
this question from tack on a mi August

654
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:02,410
2010

655
00:35:02,410 --> 00:35:06,170
the only way to manage this by watching
as the transparency issue is true

656
00:35:06,170 --> 00:35:08,470
transparency and no anonymity

657
00:35:08,470 --> 00:35:11,820
in a world a synchronous threats it is
too dangerous for there not to be

658
00:35:11,820 --> 00:35:13,589
somewhat which way to fight

659
00:35:13,589 --> 00:35:18,480
we need a verified name service for
people governments will demand

660
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:21,500
who agrees with that

661
00:35:21,500 --> 00:35:24,060
I also want to point out your there
actually is a government initiative

662
00:35:24,060 --> 00:35:25,970
that's been worked on is called mister

663
00:35:25,970 --> 00:35:29,599
nationalists national security

664
00:35:29,599 --> 00:35:32,820
national strategy for trusted identities
in cyberspace

665
00:35:32,820 --> 00:35:36,579
I'm still torn about my opinion if it is
but there are several government

666
00:35:36,579 --> 00:35:39,290
attempts to it figure out a way to do it
and the online

667
00:35:39,290 --> 00:35:42,450
here's another quote from him in this
one it's hard

668
00:35:42,450 --> 00:35:45,950
if you have something that you don't
want anyone to know maybe you shouldn't

669
00:35:45,950 --> 00:35:49,480
be doing it in the first place this is
coming from the executive chairman of

670
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:50,160
Google

671
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:56,549
what you guys think about that 21 search
meant to tell you we should do

672
00:35:56,550 --> 00:36:00,369
I don't wanna know if he does good
that's a sex tape I don't think should

673
00:36:00,369 --> 00:36:04,320
be released

674
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:08,070
so here's our from Mark Zuckerberg CEO
of Facebook

675
00:36:08,070 --> 00:36:12,400
3 for 2 p.m. the days have you have been
a different image for your work friends

676
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:16,109
or coworkers and for the other people
you know are probably coming to an end

677
00:36:16,109 --> 00:36:17,210
pretty quickly

678
00:36:17,210 --> 00:36:20,560
having two identities for yourself and
is it an example

679
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:25,180
love lack love integrity and this is
from 2011

680
00:36:25,180 --> 00:36:32,180
really sucker for telling us what I
integrity means ha

681
00:36:37,849 --> 00:36:41,190
I missed this is this is interesting
because Beckham the agency questioned

682
00:36:41,190 --> 00:36:42,250
its like

683
00:36:42,250 --> 00:36:45,320
does he decide this that they mean
obviously doesn't know how to handle

684
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:47,230
privacy settings re well

685
00:36:47,230 --> 00:36:51,099
but it's really interesting that this
seem to view this

686
00:36:51,099 --> 00:36:54,810
one noticed this this happened one
online identity as a side of integrity

687
00:36:54,810 --> 00:36:57,799
of conforming perhaps with that right
hand path that system

688
00:36:57,800 --> 00:37:01,880
so here's another my favorite quotes I'm
sure your friends with this guy

689
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:05,000
Chris Paul founder 4chan on

690
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:08,480
I love this quote the porch identity
online is often painted in black and

691
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:09,050
white

692
00:37:09,050 --> 00:37:13,150
to your online issue you're offline
humidity doesn't work like that online

693
00:37:13,150 --> 00:37:15,400
or offline it's not who you share with

694
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:19,320
it to you sure ass and of course
matisse's my talk now

695
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:23,119
identity is prismatic so to borrow some

696
00:37:23,119 --> 00:37:26,280
physics you have a prism shine the white
light through a new broadcast the Rambo

697
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:28,070
and I think the Ramblers much more
indicative

698
00:37:28,070 --> 00:37:31,829
somebody is and if you think about all
the different ways and all the different

699
00:37:31,829 --> 00:37:35,690
means you have by describing somebody
that is kinda the prism person

700
00:37:35,690 --> 00:37:40,690
i think is lamar beautiful too getting
back technical for a moment

701
00:37:40,690 --> 00:37:43,849
just the different types of relations
that you can have facebook

702
00:37:43,849 --> 00:37:47,510
a singer a synchronous means that you
send a request to them and they have to

703
00:37:47,510 --> 00:37:48,210
approve it

704
00:37:48,210 --> 00:37:51,810
as opposed to Twitter we can just follow
somebody on the course they have a

705
00:37:51,810 --> 00:37:56,299
protected account there's a number ways
to try to implement these types of

706
00:37:56,300 --> 00:37:59,880
social networks online you have a blog
platforms in a blog spot and things like

707
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:00,670
that

708
00:38:00,670 --> 00:38:04,520
and you can come to RSS feeds if you
have a whole bunch you want to follow

709
00:38:04,520 --> 00:38:08,619
you can link them together these plugins
for WordPress you can use but

710
00:38:08,619 --> 00:38:12,510
anyone remember what brings kinda
reminds me either

711
00:38:12,510 --> 00:38:15,790
Google+ is working on the a synchronous
circles I thought that was a pretty cool

712
00:38:15,790 --> 00:38:16,460
thing

713
00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:19,930
my favorite courses to ask for a does
anybody here know

714
00:38:19,930 --> 00:38:23,618
diaspora Okereke his some people do

715
00:38:23,619 --> 00:38:27,490
jasper is it not only is it a
synchronous but it's also decentralize

716
00:38:27,490 --> 00:38:31,099
address it is Facebook Twitter and other
to centralize by which I mean there's a

717
00:38:31,099 --> 00:38:34,200
walled garden observers that you don't
have access two hours to ask for

718
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:38,770
its open-source you can actually
download and install it for yourself

719
00:38:38,770 --> 00:38:42,130
here's another thing just talking about
online privacy in such that I wanted to

720
00:38:42,130 --> 00:38:43,560
touch on on the effect this

721
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:46,549
the state is actually from last year
they have new data came out but I can't

722
00:38:46,550 --> 00:38:47,020
get it to a

723
00:38:47,020 --> 00:38:50,980
form on the site as well day we went
through a whole bunch court cases and

724
00:38:50,980 --> 00:38:52,210
the drop this

725
00:38:52,210 --> 00:38:55,690
kinda rating guide on how has your back
in because I'm about to bad-mouth Google

726
00:38:55,690 --> 00:38:56,599
pretty hard

727
00:38:56,599 --> 00:38:59,820
I do want to say that they're doing some
pretty good things you know the guy

728
00:38:59,820 --> 00:39:02,760
called stars and fighting for user
privacy and things like that

729
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:05,829
I think I'm a at this point Twitter
might be my favorite though

730
00:39:05,829 --> 00:39:09,510
given the lawsuits it into our but you
know this is a course you can check it

731
00:39:09,510 --> 00:39:10,530
out who has a better idea

732
00:39:10,530 --> 00:39:14,300
such a dork but I do want to say that
Google has some really cool stuff

733
00:39:14,300 --> 00:39:16,410
they're working on

734
00:39:16,410 --> 00:39:19,960
so wanna get to the next thing here
which is

735
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:23,040
the whole real names policy we
encountered that before one

736
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:26,099
you know the initial suspension happen
well the question is will doesn't

737
00:39:26,099 --> 00:39:28,210
everyone have real names policy it turns
out well

738
00:39:28,210 --> 00:39:32,000
yeah Facebook has one curator's I am

739
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:35,020
interesting if you read through it
though real names is not to finance

740
00:39:35,020 --> 00:39:37,589
kinda case by case thing you don't
really hear that people getting

741
00:39:37,589 --> 00:39:39,349
suspended from Facebook that much for a

742
00:39:39,349 --> 00:39:42,780
names things to do there are legitimate
reasons you know if the person child

743
00:39:42,780 --> 00:39:45,060
porn stuff like that but

744
00:39:45,060 --> 00:39:48,390
that they don't seem to enforce in quite
the same way

745
00:39:48,390 --> 00:39:52,420
so sure is Google's original names real
names policy as at the time which I got

746
00:39:52,420 --> 00:39:53,760
suspended which was back in

747
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:59,170
I think July up 2011 to help fight spam
and prevent fake profiles use the name

748
00:39:59,170 --> 00:40:01,430
your friends family coworkers call you

749
00:40:01,430 --> 00:40:04,470
ok if that works for me a cool great

750
00:40:04,470 --> 00:40:07,560
whatever it's gone but there early and

751
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:11,390
force it that well this is a famous
quote from Andrew Jackson sure there is

752
00:40:11,390 --> 00:40:13,000
a surprise court ruling and he said

753
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:16,020
okay well you're the chief justice but
let's see what you do

754
00:40:16,020 --> 00:40:19,339
you go ahead and 46 I'm not going to and
the fight between

755
00:40:19,339 --> 00:40:23,839
the balance of powers in government so
both Facebook and Google+ have a real

756
00:40:23,839 --> 00:40:24,130
%uh

757
00:40:24,130 --> 00:40:27,560
names policy let's see how Google
enforces there's

758
00:40:27,560 --> 00:40:30,630
so these are the emails a day what
should I got suspended I fill up the

759
00:40:30,630 --> 00:40:31,560
appeal form

760
00:40:31,560 --> 00:40:35,279
to get there is electric appeals form so
July 23rd

761
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:38,640
I fill it out July 25th I got that far
from a guy named Danielle

762
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:42,089
for the a support team calls me to
finish or he contacts me to initiate the

763
00:40:42,089 --> 00:40:42,819
process

764
00:40:42,819 --> 00:40:47,890
I replied ok or scrape July 26 details
mister X is not a common name

765
00:40:47,890 --> 00:40:50,960
asked me to confirm is my comment and
like okay Ashur here

766
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:54,940
a sentiment email I say I concur man as
wonders a good enough

767
00:40:54,940 --> 00:40:59,150
I get ninety back San they need a
government issued ID to confirm my name

768
00:40:59,150 --> 00:41:00,200
is the steps

769
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:03,690
and I'm like I don't know if I can plan
your lebanon but really

770
00:41:03,690 --> 00:41:07,240
so I reply to this to confirm that they
deny a car that

771
00:41:07,240 --> 00:41:10,770
that they define a common name
exclusively as the name on a government

772
00:41:10,770 --> 00:41:12,009
issued ID

773
00:41:12,010 --> 00:41:16,060
also asks what their policy for handling
government ID says because

774
00:41:16,060 --> 00:41:18,750
what am I going to scan and a driver's
license and send it as an email

775
00:41:18,750 --> 00:41:19,869
attachment to them

776
00:41:19,869 --> 00:41:23,160
like what the what the fuck that has yet
do they have a policy are they going to

777
00:41:23,160 --> 00:41:23,940
delete the image

778
00:41:23,940 --> 00:41:27,290
what services are held I wanna know this
stuff I consider I don't you guys I

779
00:41:27,290 --> 00:41:29,770
considered a driver's license or any
kind a state issued ID

780
00:41:29,770 --> 00:41:32,800
sensitive information

781
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:38,210
so

782
00:41:38,210 --> 00:41:42,460
last night was way too much fun july
twenty-eighth

783
00:41:42,460 --> 00:41:46,700
this this your common name does not have
to be the name on your ID

784
00:41:46,700 --> 00:41:50,060
doctored up I need to get the name of
your idea to confirm that your name as a

785
00:41:50,060 --> 00:41:51,279
static San

786
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:55,220
again legacy

787
00:41:55,220 --> 00:41:58,390
my reply so if the name is the only
thing that you need

788
00:41:58,390 --> 00:42:01,690
can you use the information I provided
my appeal to make the same judgment

789
00:42:01,690 --> 00:42:04,490
I'm confused as to why it must be a
government issued ID i think is very

790
00:42:04,490 --> 00:42:06,710
reasonable a ballot question

791
00:42:06,710 --> 00:42:09,880
here's their spots thank you for
contacting us with regard to the name

792
00:42:09,880 --> 00:42:11,540

795
00:42:19,010 --> 00:42:19,599
name

796
00:42:19,599 --> 00:42:23,170
I will just russet has your real name
most years is just try to explain that

797
00:42:23,170 --> 00:42:25,970
is the pseudonym they have always used

798
00:42:25,970 --> 00:42:30,640
agate suspended again two weeks later

799
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:34,700
yeah an actual that's the congress a
fuckin I left are

800
00:42:34,700 --> 00:42:37,569
although the interesting thing there
that they actually did listen and they

801
00:42:37,569 --> 00:42:38,589
adjusted their

802
00:42:38,589 --> 00:42:41,410
real names policy a bit but it's still
there and that's the problem I have with

803
00:42:41,410 --> 00:42:42,060
it

804
00:42:42,060 --> 00:42:44,910
this is one of the fundamental problems
I have with all the stuff going on I no

805
00:42:44,910 --> 00:42:46,220
longer use Google+

806
00:42:46,220 --> 00:42:50,170
I will not until they come out publicly
like retract everything that they've

807
00:42:50,170 --> 00:42:50,800
done

808
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:54,839
that is my personal view anybody else
can do whatever they want

809
00:42:54,839 --> 00:42:58,220
so here's some other people they ran
into the soccer futsal as well this is a

810
00:42:58,220 --> 00:43:01,970
doc popular on the right that's his blog
on love to you does occur

811
00:43:01,970 --> 00:43:05,300
what a cool that he makes games and
plays music is a really good guy

812
00:43:05,300 --> 00:43:08,500
are Paris isin: arena other your

813
00:43:08,500 --> 00:43:12,240
this I yes see that's his driver's
licence sensitive authority acted

814
00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:15,319
he said it was okay to have the same
here notice so

815
00:43:15,319 --> 00:43:18,990
just the three letters that's the slam a
yeah

816
00:43:18,990 --> 00:43:22,770
that is your full legal name yup
restraints montana

817
00:43:22,770 --> 00:43:25,819
this is also another doc hot got
suspended a

818
00:43:25,819 --> 00:43:29,040
he said fuck you to really decide to
change this if you can see the tag line

819
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:30,250
down there

820
00:43:30,250 --> 00:43:36,040
yet made up a fake name because Google
wouldn't let me use my real one

821
00:43:36,040 --> 00:43:39,500
yes and injured and posted this is
really funny

822
00:43:39,500 --> 00:43:43,030
so here's some lessons I learned from
the Google+ fiasco Google doesn't know

823
00:43:43,030 --> 00:43:44,490
what a common name is your

824
00:43:44,490 --> 00:43:47,680
I couldn't get a straight answer them
common adverse Israel amor no

825
00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:50,848
whatever else Google's demand and
sensitive information

826
00:43:50,849 --> 00:43:54,660
without any security procedures and
policies in place if you know someone a

827
00:43:54,660 --> 00:43:55,890
Google you'll be fine

828
00:43:55,890 --> 00:43:58,629
when I was going through the summit
deliver efforts not to contact anyone

829
00:43:58,630 --> 00:43:59,900
everything I do is decide

830
00:43:59,900 --> 00:44:04,030
via Twitter I guess people are following
me and said something internally maybe I

831
00:44:04,030 --> 00:44:04,640
don't know

832
00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:08,069
I have not I also haven't asked about it
also Google

833
00:44:08,069 --> 00:44:11,609
just like everyone else doesn't have a
clue and identity means

834
00:44:11,609 --> 00:44:16,000
that's really important so some closing
remarks on all the cement

835
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:19,609
like I said it's not conclusive its to
try to get some discussion going

836
00:44:19,609 --> 00:44:23,049
churches some projects that I see that
are going in the right direction on

837
00:44:23,050 --> 00:44:26,770
is anyone here see you know heard other
use with the trust

838
00:44:26,770 --> 00:44:31,160
wanna fight primary problems over wiki
pedia is that how you know that the

839
00:44:31,160 --> 00:44:32,598
information on there is legit

840
00:44:32,599 --> 00:44:36,119
some to come in just like puttin at with
you trust is actually a series of

841
00:44:36,119 --> 00:44:38,349
algorithms great white papers and such

842
00:44:38,349 --> 00:44:42,450
that explores based on text that is
entered after how many number that its

843
00:44:42,450 --> 00:44:46,170
worth whether its move to remove things
like that and it's a I think it's a

844
00:44:46,170 --> 00:44:48,670
firefox plugin condone the time to wiki
page

845
00:44:48,670 --> 00:44:52,670
that will actually change the color of
text based on how reliable based on

846
00:44:52,670 --> 00:44:54,099
their algorithms text is

847
00:44:54,099 --> 00:44:57,770
which is pretty useful I think I am
hypothesis some friends of mine are

848
00:44:57,770 --> 00:44:58,599
working on this

849
00:44:58,599 --> 00:45:02,609
I A it's basically third they're
approaching reputation and identity in a

850
00:45:02,609 --> 00:45:04,250
really interesting way

851
00:45:04,250 --> 00:45:08,089
so let's say that you use reddit we
recommend other pages and things like

852
00:45:08,089 --> 00:45:10,890
that based on other pages you look at
rights if you go through a whole bunch

853
00:45:10,890 --> 00:45:11,609
of pages

854
00:45:11,609 --> 00:45:15,630
our rush limbaugh related you're prolly
gonna get recommend rush limbaugh stuff

855
00:45:15,630 --> 00:45:19,550
but hypothesis seems to be doing I A is
still in beta but they're really good

856
00:45:19,550 --> 00:45:21,460
guys

857
00:45:21,460 --> 00:45:25,550
it's an annotation system so let's say
that I have a legal document some case

858
00:45:25,550 --> 00:45:26,690
law and I highly

859
00:45:26,690 --> 00:45:29,619
a you know says some jargon I wanna
right now international my

860
00:45:29,619 --> 00:45:31,040
interpretation is that as

861
00:45:31,040 --> 00:45:34,710
I can start a context threaten have
discussions with people and you can up

862
00:45:34,710 --> 00:45:36,540
voter down but somebody's comment

863
00:45:36,540 --> 00:45:39,770
but then they recommend other links and
things like that

864
00:45:39,770 --> 00:45:43,280
not based on what you've looked at but
based on what you up

865
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:46,490
and they do a con bit based on your
comments which i think is much more

866
00:45:46,490 --> 00:45:48,060
reasonable and realistic

867
00:45:48,060 --> 00:45:51,710
on the other interesting thing that I
like about them is you can't

868
00:45:51,710 --> 00:45:56,619
up though or down on a comment on the
issue replied to it already

869
00:45:56,619 --> 00:45:59,869
and here's to ask for a and I'm really
happy that match that the geeks and

870
00:45:59,869 --> 00:46:01,109
oppression panel because

871
00:46:01,109 --> 00:46:05,029
ily as he also passed away last year he
was involved in diaspora

872
00:46:05,030 --> 00:46:08,470
up both were suicide so hopefully we
won't have anymore others as long as the

873
00:46:08,470 --> 00:46:10,380
depression stuff is going on

874
00:46:10,380 --> 00:46:14,569
on to ask for I think those guys are
really really doing something good

875
00:46:14,569 --> 00:46:17,910
Picasa the working with as I think where
the future things need to be

876
00:46:17,910 --> 00:46:21,509
it's a decentralized a social network
and system by which I mean

877
00:46:21,510 --> 00:46:25,180
let's say that I wanna see it so
Facebook a centralized you create an

878
00:46:25,180 --> 00:46:26,560
account on their server

879
00:46:26,560 --> 00:46:30,509
whereas diaspora i can download it
install it on my system and my friends

880
00:46:30,510 --> 00:46:31,369
who is in

881
00:46:31,369 --> 00:46:35,280
the San Francisco can install on their
system independent systems I own

882
00:46:35,280 --> 00:46:38,280
everything on I control the privacy
settings and everything

883
00:46:38,280 --> 00:46:41,730
and yet they can still talk to each
other means and how it works as an

884
00:46:41,730 --> 00:46:45,609
so that's the fun at the core of what
they're trying to do I think it's great

885
00:46:45,609 --> 00:46:49,259
I happy to talk more about any other
stuff with anyone after

886
00:46:49,260 --> 00:46:53,030
I I i think they're actually a that they
had some rocky things but they're

887
00:46:53,030 --> 00:46:53,940
they're going through

888
00:46:53,940 --> 00:46:57,260
round on her ass so hopefully either
they will create something that's really

889
00:46:57,260 --> 00:46:57,810
awesome

890
00:46:57,810 --> 00:47:02,720
or though inspire others to see so a
fuck you final closing remarks on all

891
00:47:02,720 --> 00:47:03,369
this

892
00:47:03,369 --> 00:47:07,569
explored the socialist systems like die
ask for things like that

893
00:47:07,569 --> 00:47:11,069
all current solutions fail in some way
everything

894
00:47:11,069 --> 00:47:14,859
all India passwords for captures fail
everything else

895
00:47:14,859 --> 00:47:18,470
any form to try to identify some alien
force in a real names thing with that

896
00:47:18,470 --> 00:47:21,369
doesn't work as there's no such thing as
a real and I don't think a

897
00:47:21,369 --> 00:47:24,540
it because if you call something a real
name implies that name has legitimacy

898
00:47:24,540 --> 00:47:25,910
and any other name doesn't

899
00:47:25,910 --> 00:47:28,808
as you call it a legal name something
which is issued by the government that

900
00:47:28,809 --> 00:47:30,210
something a much more except

901
00:47:30,210 --> 00:47:33,490
because I can call driver's license a
legal I'm sure real name

902
00:47:33,490 --> 00:47:36,700
is there any such thing as a real im
right

903
00:47:36,700 --> 00:47:41,069
context-dependent and I would say join
or support efforts like to ask for

904
00:47:41,069 --> 00:47:44,730
hypothesis wiki trusted cetera

905
00:47:44,730 --> 00:47:51,730
that's what I got free right now any
questions to have time for questions

906
00:47:57,030 --> 00:48:00,720
actually a I think it looks like five
minutes on a time for the next week or

907
00:48:00,720 --> 00:48:01,349
so

908
00:48:01,349 --> 00:48:04,640
ok if I'm answer questions as their
microphone that those P people can ask

909
00:48:04,640 --> 00:48:05,779
questions and

910
00:48:05,780 --> 00:48:12,780
letter okay what's your question

911
00:48:17,740 --> 00:48:21,480
right a DM yet the answer is a guy named

912
00:48:21,480 --> 00:48:25,860
indicia I've talked to many people
inside cool about this and the answer to

913
00:48:25,860 --> 00:48:26,210
me

914
00:48:26,210 --> 00:48:29,740
my impression CSP hubris it seems to me
they just don't give a shit there was

915
00:48:29,740 --> 00:48:30,420
actually a

916
00:48:30,420 --> 00:48:33,500
a document the came out I think on kik
feminism dot com

917
00:48:33,500 --> 00:48:36,590
listing all the reasons why I pseudonyms
are important

918
00:48:36,590 --> 00:48:39,720
and apparently they're just fucking
ignored by they I mean back so

919
00:48:39,720 --> 00:48:44,160
I I didn't get into this and the talk is
it too much and for not have time at the

920
00:48:44,160 --> 00:48:46,160
conductor is the Google executive in
charge

921
00:48:46,160 --> 00:48:49,899
Google+ he is the single person holding
back the real names policy so when it

922
00:48:49,900 --> 00:48:51,960
came out the web 2.0 conference last
year

923
00:48:51,960 --> 00:48:56,060
and he said that were adjusted to allow
pseudonyms he didn't really get into

924
00:48:56,060 --> 00:48:59,620
detail about what that was and then we
see the real names policy they have now

925
00:48:59,620 --> 00:49:01,290
which i think is going over in our talk

926
00:49:01,290 --> 00:49:04,779
which yeah I guess if you're famous you
can use it in like Lady Gaga but

927
00:49:04,780 --> 00:49:07,890
I guess Google the terms of your famous
just like they determine if a real man

928
00:49:07,890 --> 00:49:11,420
so I can answer this more after the talk
is over

929
00:49:11,420 --> 00:49:16,700
really complicated answer to that
there's no legal reason as far as I know

930
00:49:16,700 --> 00:49:17,290
in fact

931
00:49:17,290 --> 00:49:20,750
I ate don't know if too many examples of
people you can be an ass for a

932
00:49:20,750 --> 00:49:21,700
government issued ID

933
00:49:21,700 --> 00:49:25,090
I I would not do it unless they have
like some public

934
00:49:25,090 --> 00:49:28,270
if they have policies in place or if
they need to collect for like a

935
00:49:28,270 --> 00:49:29,290
government reason

936
00:49:29,290 --> 00:49:33,870
I can deal with that you know I'd cuz as
reliable as the government may earn it

937
00:49:33,870 --> 00:49:36,529
may not be at least they have policies
and procedures in place to deal with

938
00:49:36,530 --> 00:49:36,810
that

939
00:49:36,810 --> 00:49:40,870
I ask you will need didn't seem to have
any procedures yes question

940
00:49:40,870 --> 00:49:44,790
aka

941
00:49:44,790 --> 00:49:51,660
oh I'm not but the

942
00:49:51,660 --> 00:49:55,230
the question was the guy went through
the a val is a slam

943
00:49:55,230 --> 00:49:58,590
yet went through the same bullshit as I
didn't he said if you get we got this

944
00:49:58,590 --> 00:49:59,880
easily wanna just get worse

945
00:49:59,880 --> 00:50:03,120
oh yeah I'm not giving up at all

946
00:50:03,120 --> 00:50:05,680
that's why I'm gonna miss talkin try to
get people think about us we can come at

947
00:50:05,680 --> 00:50:06,629
a better solution

948
00:50:06,630 --> 00:50:09,990
the solution that we had initially was
just to say about

949
00:50:09,990 --> 00:50:13,160
Google+ in a few actually look at
interviews were

950
00:50:13,160 --> 00:50:17,140
attacking others gassed well how many
people are at Google+ how many users are

951
00:50:17,140 --> 00:50:17,549
there

952
00:50:17,550 --> 00:50:21,620
noticeably always answer you have to
look at Google+ for the entirety of

953
00:50:21,620 --> 00:50:22,259
Londoners

954
00:50:22,260 --> 00:50:26,470
by which like guess that means that they
forced everyone who has a Google user

955
00:50:26,470 --> 00:50:28,520
and a Google+ to complete their numbers

956
00:50:28,520 --> 00:50:32,340
I one quick example the second give as
when they did the Search Plus your world

957
00:50:32,340 --> 00:50:36,170
actually checked I was opted into
without my consent I hadn't logged in to

958
00:50:36,170 --> 00:50:37,570
Google Plus like six months

959
00:50:37,570 --> 00:50:41,620
and sure enough I was part other system
so they were doing mine in on me so

960
00:50:41,620 --> 00:50:45,350
what is a Google+ user it seems to be
nebulous what one way to attack it has

961
00:50:45,350 --> 00:50:47,230
to stop using it try to create your own

962
00:50:47,230 --> 00:50:54,230
are n yes I hope there are more efforts
like that question

963
00:50:57,089 --> 00:51:00,180
the SPR what is it its

964
00:51:00,180 --> 00:51:07,180
spooky is cuz you know I'm not
distributed public key infrastructure

965
00:51:09,380 --> 00:51:10,230
that had no

966
00:51:10,230 --> 00:51:14,500
work no certificate or is aka

967
00:51:14,500 --> 00:51:17,960
names

968
00:51:17,960 --> 00:51:24,960
okay yeah right okay so names were not
tied to paths and that they use context

969
00:51:29,160 --> 00:51:29,859
I guess run

970
00:51:29,859 --> 00:51:33,589
the names itself names are actually like
like many sons cannot names are really

971
00:51:33,589 --> 00:51:34,369
bad way to

972
00:51:34,369 --> 00:51:41,220
try to identify somebody right

973
00:51:41,220 --> 00:51:46,530
which works in turkey gets compromised
orange alert expires or something like

974
00:51:46,530 --> 00:51:48,339
that but you know I know I totally down

975
00:51:48,339 --> 00:51:52,599
that on way I saw was awesome too and
all these %uh there are security ways to

976
00:51:52,599 --> 00:51:54,410
do this but they all have their failure
points

977
00:51:54,410 --> 00:51:57,848
when trying to replicate what it seems
that online social what's

978
00:51:57,849 --> 00:52:00,910
real social networks by which I mean
like meet space

979
00:52:00,910 --> 00:52:05,060
are all about yeah there were actually
couple examples like Google or somebody

980
00:52:05,060 --> 00:52:05,599
took

981
00:52:05,599 --> 00:52:09,109
an ID and like changed it around and we
added some pictures in there

982
00:52:09,109 --> 00:52:12,859
sent to Google nationally like to
reinstate a discount so a

983
00:52:12,859 --> 00:52:15,940
am I getting kicked off kilter gonna
take another question

984
00:52:15,940 --> 00:52:19,310
54 okay one more question up

985
00:52:19,310 --> 00:52:26,310
over a kiss on the show right in the
back II

986
00:52:29,750 --> 00:52:36,750
could was what was the question I a
sinus turn 'em

987
00:52:38,380 --> 00:52:42,300
oh yeah sure yeah it well

988
00:52:42,300 --> 00:52:45,490
notice I said it's a label it and say
that it was a letter word I mean a

989
00:52:45,490 --> 00:52:46,369
letter is just

990
00:52:46,369 --> 00:52:51,450
a simple as well I'm we have a set a set
by we I mean Americans and like to the

991
00:52:51,450 --> 00:52:54,520
Western culture we listen to samples
that he is but you know the russians

992
00:52:54,520 --> 00:52:55,420
have sarokin

993
00:52:55,420 --> 00:52:58,630
they can read that just fine if you look
at the history and language in all the

994
00:52:58,630 --> 00:52:59,040
different

995
00:52:59,040 --> 00:53:02,819
at that that's why the Rosetta Stone was
so important I mean it's the way in

996
00:53:02,819 --> 00:53:06,210
which we communicate and anything can be
a symbol in my opinion it's just a

997
00:53:06,210 --> 00:53:08,400
matter of who understands that meaning
is ascribed to it

998
00:53:08,400 --> 00:53:12,140
so yes absolutely I think it's felt the
question is does it work with existing

999
00:53:12,140 --> 00:53:14,839
systems or do we have to create new
systems work better with it

1000
00:53:14,839 --> 00:53:20,250
does that answer your question aka okay
so I guess that was the last question

1001
00:53:20,250 --> 00:53:24,140
are I'll take one more don't seem to be
trying to pick me up so I see you over

1002
00:53:24,140 --> 00:53:24,460
there

1003
00:53:24,460 --> 00:53:27,710
%uh

1004
00:53:27,710 --> 00:53:33,500
right multiple personality disorder

1005
00:53:33,500 --> 00:53:40,500
I am rare

1006
00:53:41,660 --> 00:53:45,578
arm my answer to that is really
complicated also I'm not a medical

1007
00:53:45,579 --> 00:53:47,760
professional so i cant get liquored

1008
00:53:47,760 --> 00:53:51,099
DS some little answer to that but no
that's a great question happy to talk

1009
00:53:51,099 --> 00:53:52,390
with the more after about the

1010
00:53:52,390 --> 00:53:59,390
a okay so thank you very much I think
that's what I'm I think at this point

1011
00:54:00,640 --> 00:54:02,290
what is the only network news anymore
