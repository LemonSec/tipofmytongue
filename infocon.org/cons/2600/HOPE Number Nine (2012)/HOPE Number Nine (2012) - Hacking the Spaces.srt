1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:04,500
I die in mind so up next we have a large
impersonal and I think might actually

2
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:06,750
morph into a somewhat larger pan yeah

3
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:11,240
let's call it the fishbowl okay and I'm
this is something that they're probably

4
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:13,019
our most people the room

5
00:00:13,019 --> 00:00:16,869
are aware I love and our if you're not
that's really want to get on the

6
00:00:16,869 --> 00:00:20,090
internet right knee injury and somewhere
has been you can read it so you want to

7
00:00:20,090 --> 00:00:20,560
get on

8
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:24,419
the internet and I'm and read it form
your own opinion and

9
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:28,010
and I don't think it's too late to have
some controversy I'm this

10
00:00:28,010 --> 00:00:31,220
sad day by day possibly the controversy
it's it's it's never too late for

11
00:00:31,220 --> 00:00:33,420
controversy design is ongoing

12
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:37,809
as well armed drama I mean that's what
we need so I your highness and I'm

13
00:00:37,809 --> 00:00:39,300
signing talk about hacking

14
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:43,030
the spaces oh yeah thanks a lot okay
your day

15
00:00:43,030 --> 00:00:46,500
or sorry 0 I did that be nice to me

16
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:49,350
coming actually to mention the light up
became it highlights on that would

17
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:49,910
actually be

18
00:00:49,910 --> 00:00:53,250
nice because what we don't want with
this

19
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:56,920
panel here is to have that the preaching
situation so

20
00:00:56,920 --> 00:01:01,890
meet could be turned on the yeah yep its
perfect record living leave it that way

21
00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:05,570
okay because I really like to send I
hope you would like to see

22
00:01:05,570 --> 00:01:10,030
the audience okay which should not be
the audience actually

23
00:01:10,030 --> 00:01:14,580
yes x3 is just a a quick question anyone
down there

24
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:17,650
Reds the pamphlet that I call wrote

25
00:01:17,650 --> 00:01:20,979
three years ago we got so on we got okay

26
00:01:20,979 --> 00:01:24,439
that too it's okay to head to I K
doesn't matter

27
00:01:24,439 --> 00:01:27,810
at back story he said he's gonna read it
for your net her

28
00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:31,380
I have been on mine iPhone

29
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:35,149
I okay so at the back story is that

30
00:01:35,150 --> 00:01:38,430
three years ago 2009 I might my fellow

31
00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:42,259
a compactor and at monochrome the item

32
00:01:42,259 --> 00:01:47,350
technology collective a part of a found
out from Schneider who is a German and

33
00:01:47,350 --> 00:01:48,030
myself

34
00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:51,189
an Austrian me and had biz

35
00:01:51,189 --> 00:01:54,850
urge to write a critical pamphlet like
rants

36
00:01:54,850 --> 00:01:58,939
about what was going on but back then in
hackerspace sedan

37
00:01:58,939 --> 00:02:03,270
hacks basis and i think is still going
on we call the packing two spaces

38
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:03,860
because

39
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:08,038
we thought that we still think that
what's going on. hackerspace is very

40
00:02:08,039 --> 00:02:08,840
percent if

41
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:13,020
for what's going on in culture in
general that hack spaces think they are

42
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:13,430
very

43
00:02:13,430 --> 00:02:18,599
open inclusion is to a on living space
but at the same time

44
00:02:18,599 --> 00:02:22,649
they're actually the like a white boys
club sir

45
00:02:22,650 --> 00:02:26,530
who try to get out everything that is
not like them and

46
00:02:26,530 --> 00:02:30,200
that's pretty much like the basic care
teach

47
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:36,069
reformulated and and we went back to the
1960s and 1970s because we think

48
00:02:36,069 --> 00:02:39,580
and many people %uh a actually

49
00:02:39,580 --> 00:02:43,319
started a debate about that later on we
think that hackers basis

50
00:02:43,319 --> 00:02:46,720
have a clear countercultural history

51
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:50,930
going back to the sixties and seventies
%uh I wrote with Frank

52
00:02:50,930 --> 00:02:53,950
a dads at 12 hippies

53
00:02:53,950 --> 00:02:57,610
can like realize that they failed in
their dream to change

54
00:02:57,610 --> 00:03:01,680
our society as a whole %ah something
really interesting the seventies and

55
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:02,830
early eighties started

56
00:03:02,830 --> 00:03:05,920
that %uh especially with the the punk
movement

57
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:09,690
a new wave squatting at alternative

58
00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:13,800
be care centers like our any kind of non
authoritarian

59
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:16,920
structures that were built in the
seventies and early eighties

60
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:20,739
where a direct result to the field dream

61
00:03:20,739 --> 00:03:24,379
after he piece that we can change the
world as a whole and that never happens

62
00:03:24,379 --> 00:03:28,399
%ah so they said why not trying to to
create small

63
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:31,480
temporary autonomous zone so whatever
you call it

64
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:36,330
within this was Ron darkness work
actually live in a way did we

65
00:03:36,330 --> 00:03:40,489
want to live in like early like your ID
culture had a couple of love

66
00:03:40,489 --> 00:03:43,730
like interesting species in the times
when it was

67
00:03:43,730 --> 00:03:47,519
because the it's still kinda dangerous
nowadays

68
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:50,620
but you know like love you know what I'm
referring to so that

69
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:55,220
why not creating spaces within the
system where we can live in a way

70
00:03:55,220 --> 00:03:58,290
the we want to live of course that's

71
00:03:58,290 --> 00:04:01,810
to a certain extent on kinda like a

72
00:04:01,810 --> 00:04:05,209
trying to pop out of the system are
trying to get out the system doesn't

73
00:04:05,209 --> 00:04:05,730
really

74
00:04:05,730 --> 00:04:09,500
put you out of the system but at least
you can try to make

75
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:13,209
a difference and a hackerspace is on

76
00:04:13,209 --> 00:04:17,649
the first hyperspace isn't the first DIY
collective sandifer's people who

77
00:04:17,649 --> 00:04:22,078
started Palike owning or or renting or
squatting

78
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:25,580
'em you know where houses and stuff like
that in

79
00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:29,530
in San Francisco but also in in Berlin
the war in the Netherlands

80
00:04:29,530 --> 00:04:33,150
they said he %uh if we squat buildings

81
00:04:33,150 --> 00:04:36,830
we need the infrastructure to keep that
building intact

82
00:04:36,830 --> 00:04:40,120
so if we squat somewhere we need tools

83
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:44,040
to actually fix the water supplies all
that a

84
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:47,570
so from a really dynamic perspective of
we want to live

85
00:04:47,570 --> 00:04:51,460
in a building that nobody takes care of
we need to the care of bed so that was

86
00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:52,099
one

87
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:55,680
aspect of early hackerspace is we want
to live somewhere

88
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:58,830
we need to repair to place and we need
to keep it running and other

89
00:04:58,830 --> 00:05:02,479
way a silicon Walid West Coast a

90
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:06,500
a first interesting things happened as a
result to the

91
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:09,900
the feeling hippie movement a in Silicon
Valley when

92
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:13,490
when small workshops were created to a
well

93
00:05:13,490 --> 00:05:16,680
up we want to make a political
diferencia 10

94
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:20,030
try wanna play was tough 1i wanna play
with technology

95
00:05:20,030 --> 00:05:23,770
how can we do that we can really afford
to rent for

96
00:05:23,770 --> 00:05:28,740
a real warehouse but we can do something
in our own flat so flatmates

97
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:32,100
the mostly of course white back then a

98
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:37,090
start its be acquiring all the
infrastructure using that et cetera et

99
00:05:37,090 --> 00:05:37,820
cetera

100
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:41,080
the whole thing goes on of course until
on

101
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:44,370
the mid the 2000's because the first

102
00:05:44,370 --> 00:05:47,970
really do but I would call the Cambrian
explosion up at the spaces

103
00:05:47,970 --> 00:05:51,139
was in 2006 and 2007 the work

104
00:05:51,139 --> 00:05:54,550
at least three or four generations have
had two spaces

105
00:05:54,550 --> 00:05:58,500
before this giant explosion in 2007 that
kinda

106
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:01,630
happened after a the CCC camp

107
00:06:01,630 --> 00:06:05,669
in few Fort when many people there and
especially ends all the

108
00:06:05,669 --> 00:06:10,799
who always deserves a lot of applause
Road the hackerspace its design patterns

109
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:15,400
and when that happens and people like
Jacob Appelbaum a Mitch Altman soul

110
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:16,590
hackers basis

111
00:06:16,590 --> 00:06:20,539
in Vienna in Berlin exported this
certain very

112
00:06:20,539 --> 00:06:25,530
the color European almost I wouldn't
call it socialist but wary

113
00:06:25,530 --> 00:06:30,750
very let's work together have a solitary
in so solid eight and movement are for

114
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:34,340
having third spaces in a sociological
term a third spaces

115
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:37,810
space that's not working space another
living spaces something

116
00:06:37,810 --> 00:06:40,990
in between working space and a living
space so

117
00:06:40,990 --> 00:06:44,110
the space is served the in various

118
00:06:44,110 --> 00:06:48,310
European countries work growing Hurley
had more membership

119
00:06:48,310 --> 00:06:51,539
%ah and got a lot of attention at the

120
00:06:51,539 --> 00:06:54,710
CCC camp in 2007 and then

121
00:06:54,710 --> 00:06:57,990
our a very occur this

122
00:06:57,990 --> 00:07:01,430
kinda European model of the heck this
piece got

123
00:07:01,430 --> 00:07:04,440
exported to strange places

124
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:07,880
like the United States of America or
Canada or

125
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:12,699
in Tunisia and stuff like that I don't
say that hackerspace is did not exist

126
00:07:12,699 --> 00:07:17,440
a them in the loft is a good example but
the last if you take the loft

127
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:21,990
nynex and it compare to loft to
Noisebridge in san franciscan ID

128
00:07:21,990 --> 00:07:23,080
switches

129
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:26,699
colleague derived from what happened in
Berlin and Vienna

130
00:07:26,699 --> 00:07:31,000
a then the loft is a different form a
packet space then these

131
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,190
community spaces and billing in working
spaces

132
00:07:34,190 --> 00:07:37,949
that we have nowadays thanks for taking
pictures discount creepy

133
00:07:37,949 --> 00:07:42,349
your just thank you yeah and I'm

134
00:07:42,349 --> 00:07:46,969
so %uh the problem that we addressed in
hacking the space is wise

135
00:07:46,970 --> 00:07:50,569
that many people nowadays forget

136
00:07:50,569 --> 00:07:54,759
about the past the Packers spaces that
would not be this camera explosion had a

137
00:07:54,759 --> 00:07:57,520
space that wouldn't be that many expect
is nine days

138
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:02,330
without a long tradition are things
happening in the last 30 40 50

139
00:08:02,330 --> 00:08:06,050
maybe even Longoria is a comp the
cultural tradition

140
00:08:06,050 --> 00:08:09,740
we have to refer to and people nowadays
forget about that the sea

141
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:14,560
well I just wanna make something with a
note we know and I wanna do that in

142
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:17,550
Brunswick taxes so let's make a
hackerspace

143
00:08:17,550 --> 00:08:21,530
and of course there's a clear the yeah
why not do that

144
00:08:21,530 --> 00:08:24,660
of course you're but don't forget that
you

145
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:27,710
like forgetting the history of the
movement

146
00:08:27,710 --> 00:08:34,710
is for getting yourself into potential
that you have and that you could have

147
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:39,310
I don't want to dictate what people
should do with their hackerspace is but

148
00:08:39,310 --> 00:08:39,719
I

149
00:08:39,719 --> 00:08:43,349
I ate urge people to reconsider what has
been done

150
00:08:43,349 --> 00:08:47,910
and widest up has been done and my we
should probably at least

151
00:08:47,910 --> 00:08:51,670
a try to keep going on a many people

152
00:08:51,670 --> 00:08:55,399
a nowadays work %uh

153
00:08:55,399 --> 00:08:59,339
Bendigo to hackerspace is work bear go
home

154
00:08:59,339 --> 00:09:03,320
%uh and most of them are white males
that's that's how it is

155
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:07,130
but even in Germany when the there's a
long tradition of hackers bases in for

156
00:09:07,130 --> 00:09:08,360
example in the US

157
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:11,750
even in Germany it's hard to find
Turkish members in Turkey

158
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:14,920
einon in German hackers basis because of
course

159
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:18,740
people like people were like themselves

160
00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:22,190
in the places they hang out and that's
why usually hackerspace is a

161
00:09:22,190 --> 00:09:23,510
predominantly white

162
00:09:23,510 --> 00:09:27,920
meal headroom the I can even see had a
sexist your

163
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:31,310
but her Anna and

164
00:09:31,310 --> 00:09:34,589
it the whole debate of on trying

165
00:09:34,589 --> 00:09:38,830
getting women into had two spaces I mean
it's going on in going on in there are

166
00:09:38,830 --> 00:09:40,890
many many different views to see that

167
00:09:40,890 --> 00:09:44,990
many people see we really have to do
that will be even have to force

168
00:09:44,990 --> 00:09:49,230
her women into hackerspace the same Anna

169
00:09:49,230 --> 00:09:53,860
and yeah it's an eagle in some yeah it
is it is the ideal candidate in Nnanna

170
00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:55,000
Iran I think

171
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,190
Anna now but at

172
00:09:58,190 --> 00:10:01,680
I mean I like certain affirmative action
programs your but still

173
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:05,140
there has to be a clear balance because
you want to work

174
00:10:05,140 --> 00:10:08,260
with people you wanna have fun with
people who want to explore

175
00:10:08,260 --> 00:10:12,779
each other and technology in hackers
basis and you never can force something

176
00:10:12,779 --> 00:10:16,769
but the very moment people think about
what they're doing and why you like six

177
00:10:16,769 --> 00:10:17,529
dudes

178
00:10:17,529 --> 00:10:21,779
sitting in a dark corner and no one else
going there and they still think they're

179
00:10:21,779 --> 00:10:22,670
like they're

180
00:10:22,670 --> 00:10:25,670
it sits there it's there that the nerd
utopia the have

181
00:10:25,670 --> 00:10:28,709
thats that's not no it's not because

182
00:10:28,709 --> 00:10:32,790
the main problem we have as a nerd
culture and hacking culture is a nerd

183
00:10:32,790 --> 00:10:33,640
culture

184
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:37,370
he is first the ball we getting
mainstream you know

185
00:10:37,370 --> 00:10:40,620
it's a good thing at the one side on the
other hand we shouldn't go

186
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:43,670
like a stop considering that we all

187
00:10:43,670 --> 00:10:48,430
a generation of of South exploiters and
we should come like think

188
00:10:48,430 --> 00:10:52,019
what we doing and where we invest money
and who's exploiting us and how we

189
00:10:52,019 --> 00:10:53,240
exploit other people

190
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:57,079
so that's very important and her its
also

191
00:10:57,079 --> 00:11:01,459
important to remember that a only
because

192
00:11:01,459 --> 00:11:04,560
you surround yourself with things that
you like

193
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:08,779
and Knoll that doesn't mean thats that
that's

194
00:11:08,779 --> 00:11:11,920
how it should be on I think

195
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:15,099
I just like stop talking now because I
think that's a bit much basic

196
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:20,329
in true I wanted to give anyhow and now
I'd like to introduce

197
00:11:20,329 --> 00:11:23,510
Sean Bonner who is sitting next to me
shana

198
00:11:23,510 --> 00:11:27,589
is he on stage because I invited him
because for a long long time

199
00:11:27,589 --> 00:11:31,149
he has been working in many many
different subcultures

200
00:11:31,149 --> 00:11:35,990
the main problem of subcultures these
the deeper down you go into subcultures

201
00:11:35,990 --> 00:11:40,579
the less for example female members they
are if you go to the deeper level up

202
00:11:40,579 --> 00:11:42,630
underground culture you'll miss heat

203
00:11:42,630 --> 00:11:46,450
the ground elitism because it's mostly
laker

204
00:11:46,450 --> 00:11:50,260
meal groups like the liking each other
and

205
00:11:50,260 --> 00:11:54,600
the higher the level of the in the DOM
in subculture comes

206
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:58,750
the more a women are coming into the
it's the play because they are not

207
00:11:58,750 --> 00:12:03,370
as Sir segregated and you're not as
certain turned off by what's going on

208
00:12:03,370 --> 00:12:06,880
we can talk about that later on when I
talked to sharbat

209
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:10,490
is he ran a gallery space

210
00:12:10,490 --> 00:12:14,269
soul he knows about art scene he had a
record label

211
00:12:14,269 --> 00:12:18,820
so he worked in many many different
areas of subculture an independent

212
00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:19,649
culture

213
00:12:19,649 --> 00:12:24,630
and I would like to ask you if you and
now you are one of the

214
00:12:24,630 --> 00:12:29,300
founders and you running crash space her
hackerspace in LA

215
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:32,910
and I wanted to ask is very generous to
say that I run it began yeah

216
00:12:32,910 --> 00:12:37,170
yeah everybody else there does an idea I
never everyone runs a hackerspace I hope

217
00:12:37,170 --> 00:12:40,729
except that you're never letting me know
better yeah I mean I don't even show up

218
00:12:40,730 --> 00:12:44,510
traveling now yeah I close my my
question would be

219
00:12:44,510 --> 00:12:47,709
do you think that there is a and wait to
see

220
00:12:47,709 --> 00:12:51,839
and I I still think there's a crisis a
paper space is going on right now and

221
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:52,779
there's a certain

222
00:12:52,779 --> 00:12:55,839
yes still growing but where are they
growing so

223
00:12:55,839 --> 00:12:59,450
is the is the growth the cancer is the
growth something good here a

224
00:12:59,450 --> 00:13:02,570
my question would be if you if you take
all the

225
00:13:02,570 --> 00:13:06,540
subcultures in the cultures yet been
involved in two and compared the

226
00:13:06,540 --> 00:13:08,300
problems and struggles dare

227
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:12,940
with the struggles and hackers basis is
to something to learn from that

228
00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:16,899
yeah I mean that the same problems show
up again and again and again in all

229
00:13:16,899 --> 00:13:18,920
these not only some cultures

230
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:22,279
that I'd seen personally I'd apart as
bomb

231
00:13:22,279 --> 00:13:24,930
and the same people complain about them
the same people think that they're the

232
00:13:24,930 --> 00:13:25,970
only ones complaining

233
00:13:25,970 --> 00:13:29,079
about the many things that they're not
that these problems are unique to them

234
00:13:29,079 --> 00:13:32,100
but and in fact be you know these
problems exist everywhere

235
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:36,490
an I think that that the mean

236
00:13:36,490 --> 00:13:39,680
solution that I'd seen in in all the
stuff

237
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:43,070
is that the more people sit around
complaining about it

238
00:13:43,070 --> 00:13:47,060
but the worse it gets whereas when
people stop complaining about it and

239
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:48,740
just do something to make it better

240
00:13:48,740 --> 00:13:53,389
so we may go worse now yes this panel
makes it worse here

241
00:13:53,389 --> 00:13:57,720
an not soggy I give an example that so
so with you talk to crash peso crashed

242
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:58,740
base as a

243
00:13:58,740 --> 00:14:04,139
like last month I think an so we've been
around for I think three years now

244
00:14:04,139 --> 00:14:08,120
Anna as a last month our membership is
is officially fifty 50

245
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:11,320
male and female which we're pretty
excited about all

246
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:15,829
where and we had we had a couple

247
00:14:15,829 --> 00:14:19,920
arm a couple girls as founding

248
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:23,510
pieces on it I'm carlin Mar who's been
here before as one of the

249
00:14:23,510 --> 00:14:27,180
the very original founders on it but
that was always the case in fact the

250
00:14:27,180 --> 00:14:28,790
first like six months are

251
00:14:28,790 --> 00:14:32,060
eight months amid it was like 99 percent
dudes on

252
00:14:32,060 --> 00:14:35,019
nm you know there was a lot of
conversations amongst those dudes about

253
00:14:35,019 --> 00:14:35,600
how come there

254
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:38,649
there are girls coming out and you know
people really upset their sponsor

255
00:14:38,649 --> 00:14:40,300
hand-wringing about it in

256
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:44,019
pointing fingers 0 how are you know
there needs to be more girls and

257
00:14:44,019 --> 00:14:47,360
and and finally since there is someone
on the mailing list the

258
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:50,820
who chimed in am and said that

259
00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:53,610
something I thought actually made a
lotta center Nene Henry lies at the

260
00:14:53,610 --> 00:14:55,019
exact same thing happened in

261
00:14:55,019 --> 00:14:58,370
in sort of punk rock in it and
everything else before was that a buncha

262
00:14:58,370 --> 00:15:01,040
dude sitting around complain that
there's no girls

263
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:04,519
does not attract girls no

264
00:15:04,519 --> 00:15:07,800
or like Mike really like that but
there's nothing nothing appealing about

265
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:08,680
that at all

266
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:14,070
and so said bike just shutting up about
that in like inviting your friends

267
00:15:14,070 --> 00:15:17,120
to come hang out makes all the
difference in the world i like it if

268
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:17,779
we're just

269
00:15:17,779 --> 00:15:20,860
complaining that there's no girls here
and how come there's not more girls here

270
00:15:20,860 --> 00:15:23,880
that doesn't help but like you know if
I'm going but my my friends who are

271
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:25,260
girls to come hang out

272
00:15:25,260 --> 00:15:28,500
Marinho groom makes a difference right
and so thatin

273
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:32,139
so at you know like around around our
year anniversary that was sort of like

274
00:15:32,139 --> 00:15:34,910
that the decision that we all came to is
just like stop

275
00:15:34,910 --> 00:15:38,120
stop fucking complaining and may do
something

276
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:41,660
and and that that made all the
difference and I think that that that's

277
00:15:41,660 --> 00:15:43,589
a big key piece of this is that when

278
00:15:43,589 --> 00:15:47,339
people actually like think the solution
and moved for a

279
00:15:47,339 --> 00:15:50,600
that's what changes things but Mike just
complaining

280
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:53,790
you know not much the main problem i
think is that

281
00:15:53,790 --> 00:15:58,139
there people there's a difference
between trying to analyze the situation

282
00:15:58,139 --> 00:16:01,820
and trying to find out what's going on
and complaining radiative

283
00:16:01,820 --> 00:16:05,389
difference of one minute under mean
seeing that there's a problem

284
00:16:05,389 --> 00:16:11,670
is one thing am and I'm that makes a big
difference you know like

285
00:16:11,670 --> 00:16:15,870
there's not a lot of people that are
exclusionary by choice

286
00:16:15,870 --> 00:16:19,120
you knowing those people are douchebags
neon hang out in any way but the people

287
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:20,060
who are

288
00:16:20,060 --> 00:16:23,649
exclusionary by accident once they
realize that they're being stationary

289
00:16:23,649 --> 00:16:24,300
often

290
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:27,459
you know the one to try to figure out
how to not be and thats that's a good

291
00:16:27,459 --> 00:16:28,040
piece

292
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:31,320
but isn't picky element of hacker
culture

293
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:34,339
our being an elitist

294
00:16:34,339 --> 00:16:38,670
sharp I

295
00:16:38,670 --> 00:16:42,480
yet course but how can you be an elitist
at the same we

296
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:45,990
trying to be open to new on

297
00:16:45,990 --> 00:16:49,899
I maybe the Germans had the answer

298
00:16:49,899 --> 00:16:54,500
I already talked to a couple of members
of German hackerspace a former

299
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:57,509
members a German hackers bases is
sitting right there

300
00:16:57,509 --> 00:17:01,320
and I don't know whoever wants I'd like
to have to have you on stage

301
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:04,610
please do it

302
00:17:04,610 --> 00:17:08,209
the applause for germans I

303
00:17:08,209 --> 00:17:11,280
what causes the birds come by. got

304
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:18,280
wise but she coming okay Brianna

305
00:17:19,890 --> 00:17:23,579
okay and the even three microphones a
perfect

306
00:17:23,579 --> 00:17:28,220
okay not the reason is why I had them on
stage for a steady and I would like to

307
00:17:28,220 --> 00:17:32,280
like you want to be on stage later on we
want to hear their statements and then I

308
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:32,990
wanna get

309
00:17:32,990 --> 00:17:35,679
more people on stage so you can already
think about your statement if you have

310
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:37,120
one and you can come up here

311
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:40,700
okay so on do you

312
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:43,960
in in general agree with my opening
statement up like

313
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:47,700
the at hackerspace is having it long
tradition in the in the in the

314
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:51,210
in Europe ordered the format of the
hackerspace that was predominantly

315
00:17:51,210 --> 00:17:51,980
European

316
00:17:51,980 --> 00:17:56,020
got exported to the US or Canada in a
certain way do you think

317
00:17:56,020 --> 00:17:59,929
all I'm Mike from interesting am

318
00:17:59,929 --> 00:18:04,390
I don't know really because I never been
two US hikers be spaced seen before

319
00:18:04,390 --> 00:18:07,500
I reread the book Packers St the way

320
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:11,169
recently and clearly that can't beat in
her story

321
00:18:11,169 --> 00:18:14,970
and bed certainly there has been a big
push

322
00:18:14,970 --> 00:18:18,160
after the camp and am

323
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:21,570
yeah I don't know I've stop being active
expresses

324
00:18:21,570 --> 00:18:25,289
bed around the same time because I moved
in stuff soon

325
00:18:25,289 --> 00:18:28,620
and pressing and not from the right
person to ask

326
00:18:28,620 --> 00:18:32,640
training in from the US yes I think
every hackerspace I know in US is

327
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:35,710
definitely been influenced by that I
mean like we open crash base because

328
00:18:35,710 --> 00:18:39,350
you know with everyone in LA had been

329
00:18:39,350 --> 00:18:43,530
to Europe or other hackers bases that
were open because it back

330
00:18:43,530 --> 00:18:47,090
Mike we gotta have this in Los Angeles I
mean I think that and and the fact that

331
00:18:47,090 --> 00:18:49,899
they've only been around for him to have
years in the US

332
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:53,549
any been around for much much longer
means clearly influenced that there's

333
00:18:53,549 --> 00:18:54,900
definitely a relationship

334
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:58,400
why did happen in 2007 and 2008 years

335
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:02,190
and pretty sure about that the reason
statistics that many people who take me

336
00:19:02,190 --> 00:19:02,660
God

337
00:19:02,660 --> 00:19:05,660
a got fired because of the crisis

338
00:19:05,660 --> 00:19:10,160
of 2008 and their creative potential had
to go somewhere so they didn't have john

339
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:10,870
in what he wears

340
00:19:10,870 --> 00:19:14,820
like %uh like wanna do stuff so on as a
hackerspace let's go there

341
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:18,289
and worked there so there was a certain
interesting creative

342
00:19:18,289 --> 00:19:22,289
a output are of the crisis

343
00:19:22,289 --> 00:19:25,700
and I i kinda like that that is
something good coming out of this

344
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:29,049
this disaster that happened never waste
a crisis

345
00:19:29,049 --> 00:19:32,809
never waste a crisis here talk to tell
that Mark SIA

346
00:19:32,809 --> 00:19:38,080
are so a so you say that you're not a
good person to talk to hack spaces at

347
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:38,610
the hockey

348
00:19:38,610 --> 00:19:43,400
no elected a great US story but really
what in the policemen energy on

349
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:46,789
and have been involved with that CCC

350
00:19:46,789 --> 00:19:51,440
and not to tell the whole the devices
like 10 years and i've seen some packets

351
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:52,380
basis

352
00:19:52,380 --> 00:19:55,679
role and depart I'm okie to endure

353
00:19:55,679 --> 00:19:59,809
you don't say that you you not in both
the hackerspace is anymore because the

354
00:19:59,809 --> 00:20:05,418
work I like frustrated by that or is it
just like that

355
00:20:05,419 --> 00:20:09,299
I think when I realize when you open the
earlier is that

356
00:20:09,299 --> 00:20:12,429
hackers basis they're not s

357
00:20:12,429 --> 00:20:15,610
technical s we want them to be or we
think them to be

358
00:20:15,610 --> 00:20:18,650
but they're more like a social meeting
place

359
00:20:18,650 --> 00:20:23,470
where friendships formed and so when
there's not the basis for French is when

360
00:20:23,470 --> 00:20:26,980
you don't befriend a lot of people are
you not coming there for the people then

361
00:20:26,980 --> 00:20:31,230
that's not much to come for at some
point especially if you move a lot and

362
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:32,530
it's a lot of effort to

363
00:20:32,530 --> 00:20:35,908
you a sustained effort to support your
space and

364
00:20:35,909 --> 00:20:40,280
ASEAN Summit spaces which were found in
very geeky city thank katherine in

365
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:43,039
Germany where this new on the technical
universities

366
00:20:43,039 --> 00:20:47,129
which were terrible social places like
there was one girl something like that

367
00:20:47,130 --> 00:20:47,559
and

368
00:20:47,559 --> 00:20:51,059
she was finding obviously at the founder

369
00:20:51,059 --> 00:20:54,539
but there was I don't know never
something

370
00:20:54,539 --> 00:20:58,210
Nike at I think the moment where real
estate something has to be really really

371
00:20:58,210 --> 00:21:00,049
really done about that

372
00:21:00,049 --> 00:21:03,960
is when I read about nice bridge and
their modem be excellent to each other

373
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:08,179
and I think while that is kinda very
obvious and very onset

374
00:21:08,179 --> 00:21:12,360
so maybe we should actually make that
something worked very active on

375
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:15,490
Noisebridge is one of the if you had a
species on the planet

376
00:21:15,490 --> 00:21:18,630
where C and I mean you're fifty 50 the

377
00:21:18,630 --> 00:21:21,630
gender balance wonderful but Noisebridge

378
00:21:21,630 --> 00:21:25,030
is really excellent space I mean they
have lots of drama

379
00:21:25,030 --> 00:21:28,928
as part of the space and there's a lot
of bullshit going on possible I truman

380
00:21:28,929 --> 00:21:32,799
any other hacks yeahh thats exactly good
for the hackerspace

381
00:21:32,799 --> 00:21:36,340
because there's an ongoing discussion
about how we do stuff and how

382
00:21:36,340 --> 00:21:41,090
Boulevard like talking to people is
never bad enough

383
00:21:41,090 --> 00:21:44,090
even if its about bullshit your okay

384
00:21:44,090 --> 00:21:48,389
what's your name and Steffi are awesome

385
00:21:48,390 --> 00:21:52,700
arm I rent a new because school

386
00:21:52,700 --> 00:21:55,890
and arm yeah I am

387
00:21:55,890 --> 00:21:59,030
I'm and Semoran expenses and

388
00:21:59,030 --> 00:22:03,110
tend to take us with and every city %um
brand new

389
00:22:03,110 --> 00:22:08,130
rag doll %uh and the yeah my experience
is that sometimes I come to expand

390
00:22:08,130 --> 00:22:12,390
no one to talk to me commitments and
fine kind of things

391
00:22:12,390 --> 00:22:17,049
freezer from so you expect been harassed

392
00:22:17,049 --> 00:22:22,770
or don't blame know I'd sometimes it's
really like people sitting in chair and

393
00:22:22,770 --> 00:22:25,730
they don't even say law experience then
in a

394
00:22:25,730 --> 00:22:28,730
sit there like for half an hour and then
your I mean

395
00:22:28,730 --> 00:22:32,200
that that's what I'm a meant with with
heck hacking

396
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:35,590
like the hacker culture is being an
elitist culture because II

397
00:22:35,590 --> 00:22:39,240
seen so many cases I've had a sitting
somewhere with the

398
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:42,409
one of the weird our weird hecker
T-shirts your

399
00:22:42,409 --> 00:22:46,760
and if you don't laugh a t-shirt they
don't talk to you

400
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:50,140
because YouTube Hulu goals for them to
talk to her

401
00:22:50,140 --> 00:22:53,460
in a is and thats part of the whole

402
00:22:53,460 --> 00:22:57,429
of the whole thing it's like I know
something that you don't know

403
00:22:57,429 --> 00:23:01,179
yeah I like there's like here's my big
hanging out from my chest

404
00:23:01,179 --> 00:23:04,450
yeah it's an ironic BH

405
00:23:04,450 --> 00:23:08,919
but it's still a big shot

406
00:23:08,919 --> 00:23:12,460
yes you have to it you have to know yes
that's right you have to know my DH

407
00:23:12,460 --> 00:23:17,110
that's how my big look like zia and and
is there a limit the problem with that

408
00:23:17,110 --> 00:23:20,630
the expect used to accept them

409
00:23:20,630 --> 00:23:23,659
and and nor them and like them in all
their jokes

410
00:23:23,659 --> 00:23:26,950
but don't put an effort into the whole
thing but trying to learn

411
00:23:26,950 --> 00:23:32,320
to know who you are me that could be way
to put it

412
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:35,668
home my

413
00:23:35,669 --> 00:23:39,120
okay so %uh how many hacks bases have
you

414
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:42,330
visited so far when you think oh and
here I N

415
00:23:42,330 --> 00:23:46,668
a.m. yeah I I went to several thank you
know when F

416
00:23:46,669 --> 00:23:50,159
in in Germany I've been to move
independent

417
00:23:50,159 --> 00:23:53,279
going on wit and the biggest think and

418
00:23:53,279 --> 00:23:56,809
year I went to 'em NYC resistor and

419
00:23:56,809 --> 00:24:00,580
mean to me like I think def and a

420
00:24:00,580 --> 00:24:05,119
also the pool 11 12 I don't know
everything a go to in trying to find

421
00:24:05,119 --> 00:24:06,070
their company

422
00:24:06,070 --> 00:24:10,418
yeah it's been interesting to see the
tax basis in different citizen different

423
00:24:10,419 --> 00:24:10,700
the

424
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:14,879
cultures are indifferent parts of town
for example in Austria the protectors

425
00:24:14,879 --> 00:24:15,309
base

426
00:24:15,309 --> 00:24:18,350
a.m. medal at got funded by the hikes

427
00:24:18,350 --> 00:24:22,769
consular in the beginning for the first
to you something so they couldn't afford

428
00:24:22,769 --> 00:24:23,470
a pretty

429
00:24:23,470 --> 00:24:26,529
huge space which is round the corner of
the city hall

430
00:24:26,529 --> 00:24:30,139
right in the middle of town the fool ebb
in Montreal for example that's kinda

431
00:24:30,139 --> 00:24:30,499
like

432
00:24:30,499 --> 00:24:33,590
like you just like don't wanna go the
hell I

433
00:24:33,590 --> 00:24:37,820
the first occasion it was so far away
and it was in fact is getting married

434
00:24:37,820 --> 00:24:38,210
men

435
00:24:38,210 --> 00:24:41,309
it was super and you couldn't even find
it had the Dubai

436
00:24:41,309 --> 00:24:44,730
you go in it was not a whole lot a
slasher movie like a

437
00:24:44,730 --> 00:24:47,769
with it like it's like hostile with
hackers are

438
00:24:47,769 --> 00:24:53,059
yeahh but I mean if that's cool thing
I'm not I'm not complaining about that I

439
00:24:53,059 --> 00:24:53,399
mean

440
00:24:53,399 --> 00:24:56,950
where at whatever funds you have
whatever possibilities the are you have

441
00:24:56,950 --> 00:24:57,970
to use that

442
00:24:57,970 --> 00:25:01,879
to to create a community intends to do
something are so it doesn't really

443
00:25:01,879 --> 00:25:03,090
matter where it is

444
00:25:03,090 --> 00:25:06,730
sometimes I find it very interesting is
that you have for

445
00:25:06,730 --> 00:25:09,830
hackers basis in very rundown
neighborhoods

446
00:25:09,830 --> 00:25:13,059
%uh predominantly a and that's like them

447
00:25:13,059 --> 00:25:16,269
you know like that class structures of

448
00:25:16,269 --> 00:25:19,779
Western society you have a hackerspace
in an area

449
00:25:19,779 --> 00:25:24,299
where predominantly black people live
%ah and the hackerspace doesn't have a

450
00:25:24,299 --> 00:25:25,679
single black member

451
00:25:25,679 --> 00:25:29,019
yet that that that's the kind of like
you know like

452
00:25:29,019 --> 00:25:33,619
forced economics a hackerspace have to
deal with like to go somewhere

453
00:25:33,619 --> 00:25:37,489
we're we're like the that the change a
finer it's going to a space

454
00:25:37,489 --> 00:25:40,609
that so we're not trying to talk to the
people who live next to us

455
00:25:40,609 --> 00:25:44,539
and its kinda bears the same problem in
Germany with Turkish neighborhoods

456
00:25:44,539 --> 00:25:48,340
and not a single Turkish member also
other expenses they don't talk to each

457
00:25:48,340 --> 00:25:51,049
other I come from a city view to fade
when the eff

458
00:25:51,049 --> 00:25:55,509
four different meant want enhancements
and they don't

459
00:25:55,509 --> 00:25:58,809
hard times and never got there isn't
much that made my night

460
00:25:58,809 --> 00:26:03,279
status that is an excellent example I
think we should talk about

461
00:26:03,279 --> 00:26:07,820
well and because it was one of the
turning points from me

462
00:26:07,820 --> 00:26:11,889
also because am there was traditionally
a CCC

463
00:26:11,889 --> 00:26:15,359
in be the felt the city that doesn't
exist in germany and is one of the

464
00:26:15,359 --> 00:26:16,658
oldest cities

465
00:26:16,659 --> 00:26:20,309
with CCC so a.m. at some point

466
00:26:20,309 --> 00:26:23,379
their split there was art involved

467
00:26:23,379 --> 00:26:28,149
there was sumn nodes involved it split
know their stuff robot which

468
00:26:28,149 --> 00:26:31,970
probably a lot of people know measure is
the kind of an activist

469
00:26:31,970 --> 00:26:35,609
apps group yeah it's a very very
socially engaged yeah

470
00:26:35,609 --> 00:26:39,559
and they're they're not actually hackers
to more like yes a civil rights the

471
00:26:39,559 --> 00:26:40,629
other localities

472
00:26:40,629 --> 00:26:44,320
yeah exactly comparable to energy affair
for something and they have a I actually

473
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:45,230
neck as I mean

474
00:26:45,230 --> 00:26:49,700
bag then the and more news lady in the
civil war dead

475
00:26:49,700 --> 00:26:53,690
did set up the Maybach system called yes
I me in that tournament much

476
00:26:53,690 --> 00:26:57,029
true yet which how up to you to
communicate

477
00:26:57,029 --> 00:27:02,169
in that one during them warm for the the
families in serbia and in creation could

478
00:27:02,169 --> 00:27:02,830
communicate

479
00:27:02,830 --> 00:27:06,149
and me that I think that there's an
excellent people yeah

480
00:27:06,149 --> 00:27:10,129
yet and the definitely technique on
hackery people understanding they

481
00:27:10,129 --> 00:27:14,549
that actually recognize that to make a
change to have to become political

482
00:27:14,549 --> 00:27:17,619
and to stay political and dare political

483
00:27:17,619 --> 00:27:22,139
your and that's something another
English story so anyways and the author

484
00:27:22,139 --> 00:27:25,970
hackerspace happen when some new people
start to fund its easy again cuz you're

485
00:27:25,970 --> 00:27:26,460
on a date

486
00:27:26,460 --> 00:27:30,849
and out net right to merge said with
nigga on on the center

487
00:27:30,849 --> 00:27:34,869
and are you familiar with the consulate
in outnumbers center

488
00:27:34,869 --> 00:27:38,509
it's pretty much like in while

489
00:27:38,509 --> 00:27:42,580
a leftists the the name center I would
call it may

490
00:27:42,580 --> 00:27:46,210
like on to normality file Thomas
anti-fascist as it's very

491
00:27:46,210 --> 00:27:49,279
very it's a very central european left
wing

492
00:27:49,279 --> 00:27:53,259
thing where the strict rules about what
you cannot do you cannot be sexist and

493
00:27:53,259 --> 00:27:54,330
stuff like that there's

494
00:27:54,330 --> 00:27:58,139
absolutely no way to SBY sustain

495
00:27:58,139 --> 00:28:02,200
same way sex issue will be excluded so
it's a safe place

496
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:05,279
and a.m. there's

497
00:28:05,279 --> 00:28:09,059
rules these rules never really
communicate with the nerds insist

498
00:28:09,059 --> 00:28:13,158
things start to get acne and some point
there this all broken

499
00:28:13,159 --> 00:28:16,490
and now there's a forest generation
which tries to mend

500
00:28:16,490 --> 00:28:20,559
this which is I was not associated with
any of the others and services paint on

501
00:28:20,559 --> 00:28:21,918
his forehead kiss bassist

502
00:28:21,919 --> 00:28:25,070
and for me is the perfect example of

503
00:28:25,070 --> 00:28:28,799
how'd communication can go over on and
why a

504
00:28:28,799 --> 00:28:32,129
thinking about politics and in

505
00:28:32,129 --> 00:28:37,349
rules in a group are very very much
important to make something sustainable

506
00:28:37,349 --> 00:28:40,629
and inclusion ist yeah we haven't her

507
00:28:40,629 --> 00:28:43,659
said hello to number three what's your
name

508
00:28:43,659 --> 00:28:48,649
I am honest so have been involved in
billion and the CCC since impacted tooth

509
00:28:48,649 --> 00:28:49,929
how much thank

510
00:28:49,929 --> 00:28:54,419
and than in 2010 I am moved over to you
Cup making

511
00:28:54,419 --> 00:28:57,440
and now I'm standing there and also %um

512
00:28:57,440 --> 00:29:00,649
bit involved but not too much but yeah

513
00:29:00,649 --> 00:29:05,889
says up involved in the billion CCC and
in the congress

514
00:29:05,889 --> 00:29:10,669
preparations and so on but I actually
left the CCC but for five years ago

515
00:29:10,669 --> 00:29:13,799
because it was pissed off mister
structure

516
00:29:13,799 --> 00:29:19,789
some other stuff but I fair nice contact
sample America space is actually work

517
00:29:19,789 --> 00:29:23,490
really really great and that's and Don
Redman croatia

518
00:29:23,490 --> 00:29:27,210
so I mean you kiss labia has a lot of
ethnic groups

519
00:29:27,210 --> 00:29:30,389
and nearly all of them are

520
00:29:30,389 --> 00:29:33,759
pretty nationalistic or d'amato
nationalists

521
00:29:33,759 --> 00:29:37,839
in there was ethnic groups send da group
they actually had the problem they

522
00:29:37,839 --> 00:29:39,059
wanted to fun

523
00:29:39,059 --> 00:29:42,519
to fund a hackerspace anti to do
something and do

524
00:29:42,519 --> 00:29:46,289
interesting stuff but they didn't want
to deal with all those

525
00:29:46,289 --> 00:29:49,919
nationalist I mean that didn't wan't T T

526
00:29:49,919 --> 00:29:53,339
really to integrate them I made

527
00:29:53,339 --> 00:29:57,320
just wanted to be de salsa and they
wanted to be opened to the

528
00:29:57,320 --> 00:30:00,539
to the other countries to the other
ethnic groups sued

529
00:30:00,539 --> 00:30:05,129
some hands-on so but they actually did
her so this club mama much

530
00:30:05,129 --> 00:30:08,589
exists since 15 years I believe

531
00:30:08,589 --> 00:30:12,970
and its they even found a place in the
city centre which is

532
00:30:12,970 --> 00:30:17,070
next to me gay lesbian center and next
two years

533
00:30:17,070 --> 00:30:20,739
serbian countries sent so it's in the
same

534
00:30:20,739 --> 00:30:24,049
make your this is so in congress centre
and

535
00:30:24,049 --> 00:30:27,089
its directly in da crib in creation

536
00:30:27,089 --> 00:30:31,509
so Alden or nearly all the nationalist
don't really want to come there because

537
00:30:31,509 --> 00:30:31,960
it's

538
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:36,200
next serbian culture sent and also all
the the

539
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:39,359
heteronormative people don't want to
come there because

540
00:30:39,359 --> 00:30:43,009
they share the same rooms with the gay
and lesbian them

541
00:30:43,009 --> 00:30:46,080
Kathy and met

542
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:49,918
such a nice I have all the fun

543
00:30:49,919 --> 00:30:54,830
and he really in an amazing new bed
really love them in their

544
00:30:54,830 --> 00:31:00,080
really really nice people and what they
all said the same day he also had been

545
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:01,779
the parliament and the City

546
00:31:01,779 --> 00:31:06,200
so they get some funding and ordered to
organize conferences

547
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:11,779
around the country and the do that by
integration of other ethnic groups

548
00:31:11,779 --> 00:31:15,849
Sunday we have a conference on they have
actually a conference which was done for

549
00:31:15,849 --> 00:31:17,359
a five times a year

550
00:31:17,359 --> 00:31:21,429
and different city soon also in Siberian

551
00:31:21,429 --> 00:31:25,809
macedonia and and croatia and Sun

552
00:31:25,809 --> 00:31:30,249
and don't over stimulate americans with
country names

553
00:31:30,249 --> 00:31:32,309
from heart

554
00:31:32,309 --> 00:31:36,010
then them back in the days and was all
you guys labia

555
00:31:36,010 --> 00:31:39,220
that doesn't exist anymore and it's now
a.m.

556
00:31:39,220 --> 00:31:42,570
lots of different packs and

557
00:31:42,570 --> 00:31:46,020
them so that conference is called
nothing will happen

558
00:31:46,020 --> 00:31:49,610
and the name is you to the bank because
the first time the

559
00:31:49,610 --> 00:31:54,200
went to sarajevo bitches and seven yes
and creations went to serbia

560
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:57,770
just after the war and they only wanted
to

561
00:31:57,770 --> 00:32:02,120
hank I mean they didn't want to do
something and they were but very many

562
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:03,650
people will show up the guns

563
00:32:03,650 --> 00:32:06,820
sent so serbians want to kill members
said

564
00:32:06,820 --> 00:32:10,870
so they decided only more less college
nothing will happen

565
00:32:10,870 --> 00:32:14,070
and hopefully and nothing will happen

566
00:32:14,070 --> 00:32:17,168
him might my question for you would be

567
00:32:17,169 --> 00:32:20,929
Tom una their is

568
00:32:20,929 --> 00:32:25,450
I had a late like as a like the fallout
are of publishing hacking hacking the

569
00:32:25,450 --> 00:32:28,789
spaces was that many many people
complain about it and you can see that

570
00:32:28,789 --> 00:32:30,580
the Bob applies all bullshit

571
00:32:30,580 --> 00:32:33,840
and it was it was blocked on Boing Boing

572
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:38,380
and a couple of people say patter
disaster for the PRI pakistanis is that

573
00:32:38,380 --> 00:32:40,149
this paper it is perhaps lead was

574
00:32:40,149 --> 00:32:44,520
published and Nepal or not they all
think we all assholes in bottle

575
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:49,870
and I and my question would be because I
always have this discussion

576
00:32:49,870 --> 00:32:52,990
with with with especially people
affected spaces in the US

577
00:32:52,990 --> 00:32:57,970
that I tell them a hackerspace at the
history and the present at the

578
00:32:57,970 --> 00:32:58,640
hackerspace

579
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:02,100
is it's a political statement to a
certain extent your are

580
00:33:02,100 --> 00:33:06,070
many members American exp to say no it's
not a political

581
00:33:06,070 --> 00:33:10,379
room it's just like we just wanna play
with Arduino soon have fun and it's not

582
00:33:10,380 --> 00:33:11,360
political at all

583
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:15,620
mine and i was tellin come on there is
everything is political come on

584
00:33:15,620 --> 00:33:22,059
YouTube Duplo to the by you

585
00:33:22,059 --> 00:33:26,610
the very moment you go to supermarket
and buy a coke

586
00:33:26,610 --> 00:33:29,620
that's a political act how can like

587
00:33:29,620 --> 00:33:33,539
being a hackerspace and using out we
know in talking about the I'm I'm not

588
00:33:33,539 --> 00:33:37,090
being political I mean it's completely
absurd or his economy minister

589
00:33:37,090 --> 00:33:40,940
a we think there is a difference in that
respect between

590
00:33:40,940 --> 00:33:44,370
Europeans and Americans US Americans

591
00:33:44,370 --> 00:33:47,690
a for actually for you and for you for
both the view

592
00:33:47,690 --> 00:33:51,260
missed you start from Ian yeah yeah and
and how to sell ok

593
00:33:51,260 --> 00:33:54,220
well as you can see I think I think that
that ties into what you're talking about

594
00:33:54,220 --> 00:33:56,780
earlier about popularity and things
right because they're

595
00:33:56,780 --> 00:34:00,260
there's always lies on right taxonomy
things lying around writers attacker

596
00:34:00,260 --> 00:34:02,460
spaces and maker spaces in tech lab

597
00:34:02,460 --> 00:34:05,220
in all these things which the word get
used interchangeably but they're

598
00:34:05,220 --> 00:34:06,100
different things

599
00:34:06,100 --> 00:34:10,210
straight and and because somethings
popular species a piece and it

600
00:34:10,210 --> 00:34:14,310
and then wants to be apart that piece in
it like you if you look at it like

601
00:34:14,310 --> 00:34:17,918
must jump at it and look at music right
now and there's not a lot just not kids

602
00:34:17,918 --> 00:34:20,580
like getting into punk rock right now
worried that they're gonna get beat up

603
00:34:20,580 --> 00:34:21,980
its core rate because it's like

604
00:34:21,980 --> 00:34:25,330
all over the place in its like accepted
in and its cool

605
00:34:25,330 --> 00:34:29,020
in this early know that way twenty years
ago

606
00:34:29,020 --> 00:34:31,530
you know are showing up at school with
the Mohawk they're going to their ass

607
00:34:31,530 --> 00:34:34,359
kicked like five times during the day
rate it didn't even matter

608
00:34:34,359 --> 00:34:36,848
and so the same thing with with
hackerspace is right that people who

609
00:34:36,849 --> 00:34:38,179
should who go to

610
00:34:38,179 --> 00:34:42,530
someplace now that that be call a
hackerspace but maybe it to make a space

611
00:34:42,530 --> 00:34:44,179
for me to take laver something else

612
00:34:44,179 --> 00:34:47,159
because they just want access to a laser
printer a laser cutter right they don't

613
00:34:47,159 --> 00:34:49,230
know anything about the community don't
care about

614
00:34:49,230 --> 00:34:53,020
about thank dr. and they don't care
about anything like that the Disney

615
00:34:53,020 --> 00:34:56,089
me access to a laser cutter and so like

616
00:34:56,089 --> 00:34:59,830
it hackerspace is I you know maybe is
being elitist but I fight

617
00:34:59,830 --> 00:35:03,330
I hope like something that's called the
hackerspace to a much higher regard than

618
00:35:03,330 --> 00:35:06,040
anything else because I think the
community is the most important piece

619
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:06,420
min

620
00:35:06,420 --> 00:35:10,200
think the community in the hackerspace
exists and the tools

621
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:13,770
like show our work like rotate around it
is sorta like supporting

622
00:35:13,770 --> 00:35:16,880
whereas something like maker space or
something that is

623
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:21,780
is more per predominately about the
tools that people need access to and and

624
00:35:21,780 --> 00:35:23,410
and their hands are being people that

625
00:35:23,410 --> 00:35:27,098
the shop around so if you value
hackerspace is very high on your

626
00:35:27,099 --> 00:35:32,510
on your your scale yes %uh then you can
actually fall pretty deep I think so is

627
00:35:32,510 --> 00:35:35,020
there an example but do you think of
ways he like that

628
00:35:35,020 --> 00:35:39,270
really just like that really failed as
as a concept

629
00:35:39,270 --> 00:35:42,280
a specific expertise for something i
mean I'm not gonna

630
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:45,730
KK on your not marcus Thornton on

631
00:35:45,730 --> 00:35:47,599
now I don't know I mean there there's
definitely there's definitely

632
00:35:47,599 --> 00:35:48,760
hackerspace is winning

633
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:51,869
like you're saying there's a hackerspace
re can go to where nobody's gonna gonna

634
00:35:51,869 --> 00:35:52,530
talk yet been

635
00:35:52,530 --> 00:35:55,780
I've been to those myself you know
traveling I try to find hackers bases in

636
00:35:55,780 --> 00:36:00,390
in going out them in you know you can be
like sitting at a hackerspace

637
00:36:00,390 --> 00:36:03,680
all day like working on stuff in the BX
an endless love people coming in an

638
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:06,000
outcall never say how do you like the
entire time right

639
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:09,640
and and those people aren't there
because a community obviously therefore

640
00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:13,230
for something else and so like in Los
Angeles with cash based we had

641
00:36:13,230 --> 00:36:16,690
we had people who you would contact us
and say like you know

642
00:36:16,690 --> 00:36:20,730
is there a way to be. it makes for a
partial member just think a min uses

643
00:36:20,730 --> 00:36:23,970
tools and then like I don't come to
meetings necessarily

644
00:36:23,970 --> 00:36:27,210
and we would just say like a fuck urself
because I think that's not what

645
00:36:27,210 --> 00:36:30,440
that's not what we were about to quit
you know we wanted to create community

646
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:34,109
and he just needed to rant like a drill
press there's like some other place that

647
00:36:34,109 --> 00:36:35,150
you can go do that

648
00:36:35,150 --> 00:36:39,080
we wanted we wanted the people there to
be there regardless of whatever else was

649
00:36:39,080 --> 00:36:40,359
around

650
00:36:40,359 --> 00:36:44,270
okay and media that statement from
Hannah's and then we should exchange at

651
00:36:44,270 --> 00:36:45,900
least one time because it's already

652
00:36:45,900 --> 00:36:50,700
Jesus Christ times and said I'm actually
not to have a

653
00:36:50,700 --> 00:36:53,890
not too sure about the american had a
spacious other day

654
00:36:53,890 --> 00:36:56,960
North American Express is because they
only have been

655
00:36:56,960 --> 00:37:00,490
them San Franciscan to noise prints and

656
00:37:00,490 --> 00:37:04,000
then I was there last year and this year
amid in Pittsburgh and tapping that to

657
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,550
help Pittsburgh

658
00:37:05,550 --> 00:37:09,410
am but also in Europe I've been around
him cotton Hayden and in Germany at

659
00:37:09,410 --> 00:37:10,879
several spaces

660
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:14,380
and somehow in Germany at least that

661
00:37:14,380 --> 00:37:17,630
turns out that all those take us pizza
so pretty

662
00:37:17,630 --> 00:37:21,060
political but on the other side also in

663
00:37:21,060 --> 00:37:24,849
darlene there are split loss of haikus
basis in order to YouTube

664
00:37:24,849 --> 00:37:28,010
find some found some make us basis
awesome

665
00:37:28,010 --> 00:37:32,349
some troops some tools which I'm not
interested in politics and more

666
00:37:32,349 --> 00:37:35,619
which don't want to deal with that and
don't want

667
00:37:35,619 --> 00:37:39,290
I mean stiller's small concerts
community which a friend

668
00:37:39,290 --> 00:37:42,900
France of each other but they don't
really want to do the whole political

669
00:37:42,900 --> 00:37:43,690
stuff but

670
00:37:43,690 --> 00:37:47,819
only ship to wield or mainly share tools

671
00:37:47,819 --> 00:37:51,720
okay and of the feeling that um hecka
spaces

672
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:54,910
should be political and they must be
political I mean it's a political

673
00:37:54,910 --> 00:37:56,879
statement it's like hitchhiking

674
00:37:56,880 --> 00:38:01,520
I'm I go there I share my experience and
my name I E

676
00:38:04,819 --> 00:38:09,770
take it for free I don't want to deal
with money and take a space

um my next record in animal librarian
from Ontario

695
00:39:15,010 --> 00:39:17,960
on for the last three or four years I've
been traveling around the hackerspace is

696
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:19,869
no te reo North America a visit every

697
00:39:19,869 --> 00:39:23,569
Packers basement area and I'm trying
actually bring hyperspace it would apply

698
00:39:23,569 --> 00:39:25,040
brings

699
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:28,460
so I speak at like the Commons is about
Pakistan's yeah

700
00:39:28,460 --> 00:39:31,940
I'm good by

701
00:39:31,940 --> 00:39:35,970
and I E you sure are hiking space is
quite a bit I'm extremely critical

702
00:39:35,970 --> 00:39:37,050
actually

703
00:39:37,050 --> 00:39:40,470
in the exact same way you are to fight a
hackerspace enough to become completely

704
00:39:40,470 --> 00:39:42,730
apolitical in a move to the US

705
00:39:42,730 --> 00:39:47,569
and I'm not sure if it's about the like
the US in general but I think there's a

706
00:39:47,569 --> 00:39:48,410
certain

707
00:39:48,410 --> 00:39:52,770
a that it is a certain like a
conservative regress going on at that

708
00:39:52,770 --> 00:39:53,700
yes the

709
00:39:53,700 --> 00:39:56,950
that is you can feel it in hackers basis
to a month sure

710
00:39:56,950 --> 00:40:00,480
it's like all the hackerspace fault yep
politics in general is

711
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:03,599
I've got interested now talking to
history hocker spaces got an interesting

712
00:40:03,599 --> 00:40:05,210
historical example

713
00:40:05,210 --> 00:40:08,339
when we go to the thing that might be
interested in and a question i'd like to

714
00:40:08,339 --> 00:40:09,230
ask about that

715
00:40:09,230 --> 00:40:13,369
okay cool lookin so a pirate

716
00:40:13,369 --> 00:40:16,540
are yeah I'd like to say they have
unread on that

717
00:40:16,540 --> 00:40:20,600
packing space is yet but I intend to arm
for

718
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:23,779
I'm I'm Ben the pirate and are

719
00:40:23,780 --> 00:40:26,830
you my credit is that on the vice
president had DC

720
00:40:26,830 --> 00:40:30,380
cell and I I based on your description
so far I think

721
00:40:30,380 --> 00:40:34,080
you know I disagree with some love your
some your statements

722
00:40:34,080 --> 00:40:37,940
the made at least with regards to hack
DC I hope so have been

723
00:40:37,940 --> 00:40:41,569
though I I think our I think that their

724
00:40:41,569 --> 00:40:44,759
for example the ratio love other are

725
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:48,060
ethnic groups the ratio women i think is
reflective

726
00:40:48,060 --> 00:40:51,970
are the ratio love people in those
industries

727
00:40:51,970 --> 00:40:55,240
in our you know in our area there aren't
many women with her grandmother

728
00:40:55,240 --> 00:40:56,109
industries

729
00:40:56,109 --> 00:40:59,540
on I industries in technology

730
00:40:59,540 --> 00:41:04,130
in you know working in in tech jobs like
there aren't as many women working

731
00:41:04,130 --> 00:41:07,410
in technology working in fields that are
you know

732
00:41:07,410 --> 00:41:10,490
that our related to things that we do
have to see

733
00:41:10,490 --> 00:41:13,839
you know as in proportion a man in but
that he defines what

734
00:41:13,839 --> 00:41:17,940
is technology will I'm not saying
devising argument thing in terms of

735
00:41:17,940 --> 00:41:19,210
things that get done

736
00:41:19,210 --> 00:41:22,339
acting kinda projects that we work on
arm

737
00:41:22,339 --> 00:41:26,750
in those hines industries it's
reflective so used is think that hacked

738
00:41:26,750 --> 00:41:28,150
DC's more defined

739
00:41:28,150 --> 00:41:31,910
over the projects that are going on a
and some of them are not ass

740
00:41:31,910 --> 00:41:35,859
appealing for women that's what would
you say your

741
00:41:35,859 --> 00:41:39,359
are I don't think it's defined in terms
the

742
00:41:39,359 --> 00:41:42,509
the project lawyers and yen weighed as
defined by the projects that

743
00:41:42,510 --> 00:41:47,650
that are going on it's you know we exist
to you facility learning to facilitate

744
00:41:47,650 --> 00:41:51,410
II your club racin and to you you know

745
00:41:51,410 --> 00:41:55,500
to do wat you know to work on some
things to foster projects that you know

746
00:41:55,500 --> 00:41:59,310
that I can see really taking off like in
any other kind venue

747
00:41:59,310 --> 00:42:03,060
and years some you we do have work we do
have a number of

748
00:42:03,060 --> 00:42:06,180
female members arm we've had

749
00:42:06,180 --> 00:42:11,560
you know but its in you know we have a
lot of hardware hackers we have a lot of

750
00:42:11,560 --> 00:42:13,150
people are in electronics

751
00:42:13,150 --> 00:42:16,319
we have a lot of people that are in the
software we have a lot of people better

752
00:42:16,319 --> 00:42:17,450
into fields that

753
00:42:17,450 --> 00:42:22,180
in the DC area at least there aren't a
lot of women working in those fields

754
00:42:22,180 --> 00:42:25,350
on mirell to their couple of women in
the DC area

755
00:42:25,350 --> 00:42:29,150
yeah there are no I'm saying there are
and we have we have many women

756
00:42:29,150 --> 00:42:32,850
at you %uh the space who are programs
are women in space who are her hackers

757
00:42:32,850 --> 00:42:33,940
woman in space

758
00:42:33,940 --> 00:42:37,119
who are into amateur radio where women
at the space who are

759
00:42:37,119 --> 00:42:40,150
a graphics designers minutes base were
architects

760
00:42:40,150 --> 00:42:44,609
so its we do have women at the states
and we do have other

761
00:42:44,609 --> 00:42:47,509
ethnic groups at the space you like
prolly time a little darker than the

762
00:42:47,510 --> 00:42:51,560
rest you

763
00:42:51,560 --> 00:42:55,330
granted yeah

764
00:42:55,330 --> 00:42:59,029
okie I'm not going to name names at all
I'll just see that

765
00:42:59,030 --> 00:43:02,160
I have been heavily involved in acts
this community for years

766
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:05,390
are my circles bases arm I love to space

767
00:43:05,390 --> 00:43:09,650
over frustration about these types of
issues I really I felt like I was trying

768
00:43:09,650 --> 00:43:11,130
to drag people in the caring

769
00:43:11,130 --> 00:43:14,200
and I was doing trying to drag people
knowing where and eventually left

770
00:43:14,200 --> 00:43:17,650
I felt it in this case for King the
group was going to be better than trying

771
00:43:17,650 --> 00:43:19,270
to you

772
00:43:19,270 --> 00:43:22,790
bring awareness to and people who really
just wanted to build your dream stuff

773
00:43:22,790 --> 00:43:26,740
on so for me this is their own personal
topic and like I said I don't wanna

774
00:43:26,740 --> 00:43:30,660
implicate people I think people involved
in describe our okay humans

775
00:43:30,660 --> 00:43:35,020
I just don't think that V get the aspect
love

776
00:43:35,020 --> 00:43:38,850
we have a lot of power we have why I
think it's a very American thing to see

777
00:43:38,850 --> 00:43:41,880
are the humans we have to tolerate it
sometimes you can just see your ass

778
00:43:41,880 --> 00:43:43,610
holes

779
00:43:43,610 --> 00:43:46,630
I think that there could be let me be
act like assholes sometimes

780
00:43:46,630 --> 00:43:50,380
that that's ok tolerance and vice versa
probably an asshole sometimes you are

781
00:43:50,380 --> 00:43:51,250
totally by a

782
00:43:51,250 --> 00:43:54,460
yes so that's all okay well

783
00:43:54,460 --> 00:43:57,830
my name's Georgia and the director and
the hatchery in philadelphia

784
00:43:57,830 --> 00:44:02,590
ok cool on we actually have the majority
of our volunteers are women

785
00:44:02,590 --> 00:44:05,660
excellent and will %ah

786
00:44:05,660 --> 00:44:08,850
Anna

787
00:44:08,850 --> 00:44:11,860
compiler we what would be heard from our
a

788
00:44:11,860 --> 00:44:16,270
friend who doesn't fit into the scheme
of skin color here on

789
00:44:16,270 --> 00:44:20,490
stage notes I am breaking your pattern
iron

790
00:44:20,490 --> 00:44:25,010
I you Turkish no that the German choc

791
00:44:25,010 --> 00:44:28,590
so what what you heard

792
00:44:28,590 --> 00:44:32,820
what what he was saying at like to think
that there's a big difference between

793
00:44:32,820 --> 00:44:34,720
what's going on for Delphine what's
going on

794
00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:38,200
in Washington DC made from his
perspective nor did

795
00:44:38,200 --> 00:44:41,690
it sounds like tag you're doing a better
job than some other

796
00:44:41,690 --> 00:44:45,510
hackerspace is that the diversity thing
but I know for the factory

797
00:44:45,510 --> 00:44:49,570
as a lot about arm the invitation we
give to people

798
00:44:49,570 --> 00:44:53,250
and that's made it more welcoming space
and also

799
00:44:53,250 --> 00:44:56,830
I think the projects that we were going
to have something to do with it are

800
00:44:56,830 --> 00:44:59,830
projects a lot more focus on our in the
community and

801
00:44:59,830 --> 00:45:03,779
within a tunnel outreach we've done
stuff with library were gonna

802
00:45:03,780 --> 00:45:08,210
be doing some classes in a new space in
the home Free Library of Philadelphia

803
00:45:08,210 --> 00:45:12,590
we've also been doing some a lot I've
kids classes actually you

804
00:45:12,590 --> 00:45:16,630
at a local arts cloning had a huge
demand from homeschool parents to help

805
00:45:16,630 --> 00:45:17,510
them out with

806
00:45:17,510 --> 00:45:22,670
I'd teaching their kids so i think thats
a like the subject matter has drawn a

807
00:45:22,670 --> 00:45:24,620
lot more women to your interests and

808
00:45:24,620 --> 00:45:28,640
no I would agree that but in DC in
particular thing there are other groups

809
00:45:28,640 --> 00:45:32,569
dad fill those roles are for example
weak La Brea lot with a group called

810
00:45:32,570 --> 00:45:33,770
Casey DC

811
00:45:33,770 --> 00:45:37,890
a knowledge Commons DC and they are
predominantly female

812
00:45:37,890 --> 00:45:41,920
but they don't have a physical space and
a lot of times %uh the house classes

813
00:45:41,920 --> 00:45:46,270
in our space a lot of times are we teach
those classes la times you know nor

814
00:45:46,270 --> 00:45:49,540
United us that we're interested in and
so we do work in a group that

815
00:45:49,540 --> 00:45:52,800
need here more to do things that women
in the area interested in

816
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:56,540
by you know there are times when the
when women far outnumber the men in

817
00:45:56,540 --> 00:45:57,060
space

818
00:45:57,060 --> 00:46:00,710
arm and sometimes it's because I case
easy classes that are going on

819
00:46:00,710 --> 00:46:04,560
on board some our group that's you know
happens to be upholding a ban

820
00:46:04,560 --> 00:46:08,529
the space at least be the first thing I
do think

821
00:46:08,530 --> 00:46:12,260
I believe in forking I really believe
that you there is that comfort level

822
00:46:12,260 --> 00:46:13,660
with people are familiar with you

823
00:46:13,660 --> 00:46:16,720
I think it actually it makes some sense
when you talk about us

824
00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:19,780
like the city example earlier give me a
group where

825
00:46:19,780 --> 00:46:23,720
both people wanna do similar things but
their car for on each other

826
00:46:23,720 --> 00:46:26,960
even as one or two members that was
really upside each other silly splinter

827
00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:27,660
different groups

828
00:46:27,660 --> 00:46:31,899
and actually can I think that's good I
think that and I think that there's a

829
00:46:31,900 --> 00:46:34,110
diversity in having three groups in town

830
00:46:34,110 --> 00:46:37,840
trying to use on a similar stuff and
being on friendly terms with each other

831
00:46:37,840 --> 00:46:40,720
and under sail again I don't work with
them on all these projects because I

832
00:46:40,720 --> 00:46:42,140
don't agree with some other views

833
00:46:42,140 --> 00:46:46,839
because you do there you know to Central
Church from a political standpoint

834
00:46:46,840 --> 00:46:50,720
I would see that's the worst thing that
can happen because it's again fractal

835
00:46:50,720 --> 00:46:52,230
Ising the marginalized

836
00:46:52,230 --> 00:46:56,580
and then they're like to small group and
not like little bigger group that did

837
00:46:56,580 --> 00:46:59,440
that has some kinda impacts are
Republicans and Democrats purses a

838
00:46:59,440 --> 00:47:02,300
multi-party system I don't get me with
Republicans and Democrats

839
00:47:02,300 --> 00:47:05,540
menotti third-party you assholes million

840
00:47:05,540 --> 00:47:09,870
good political issue the political
issues that I think I think another

841
00:47:09,870 --> 00:47:11,600
thing that I want to address because

842
00:47:11,600 --> 00:47:14,870
hack DC is registered 501 c3 non-profit

843
00:47:14,870 --> 00:47:18,569
and that makes certain types I love
political activity

844
00:47:18,570 --> 00:47:22,120
difficult for us to maintain our
non-profit status

845
00:47:22,120 --> 00:47:26,380
so we have to have to be careful about
what kind of unlikely doing it and we do

846
00:47:26,380 --> 00:47:27,600
engage in played like Danny

847
00:47:27,600 --> 00:47:31,260
if i'm talking about political I that I
think I have to remind

848
00:47:31,260 --> 00:47:35,840
that political little doesn't mean party
politics it means

849
00:47:35,840 --> 00:47:39,790
I mean no I do not need to get my
commercial for call book in your

850
00:47:39,790 --> 00:47:43,300
in your in your library but you don't
get money anymore huh

851
00:47:43,300 --> 00:47:47,250
are you lose your ILU used use it well
90 minutes its

852
00:47:47,250 --> 00:47:50,490
when we were trying to get our 501 c3
status

853
00:47:50,490 --> 00:47:53,660
I wanna the you know one of the concerns
that was raised wise

854
00:47:53,660 --> 00:47:57,990
are you know fostering certain types
apply to me that we had on our website

855
00:47:57,990 --> 00:48:01,330
be for example if you would have her
like a

856
00:48:01,330 --> 00:48:04,580
I took an X remix and extreme example
now

857
00:48:04,580 --> 00:48:08,000
if you would have like a and let's read
Marx

858
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:11,650
thing and you're and Rackspace which
actually happens in expenses

859
00:48:11,650 --> 00:48:15,380
like that that was going on with that
now that would be totally acceptable

860
00:48:15,380 --> 00:48:16,610
things like that when I

861
00:48:16,610 --> 00:48:20,630
about politics I mean by general and
eyes and I the last and analyze member

862
00:48:20,630 --> 00:48:21,360
meeting we

863
00:48:21,360 --> 00:48:25,710
voted overwhelmingly to you sign the
internet declaration freedom as

864
00:48:25,710 --> 00:48:32,710
as an official group as an organization
so what like

865
00:48:34,320 --> 00:48:37,890
right but also we can't support our
particular

866
00:48:37,890 --> 00:48:42,120
candidate we can't arm we can't host
like events that Mike

867
00:48:42,120 --> 00:48:45,880
that might be in supporting a particular
candidate and it's good because marks is

868
00:48:45,880 --> 00:48:46,410
dead

869
00:48:46,410 --> 00:48:49,859
anyways rain right we can support

870
00:48:49,860 --> 00:48:53,000
began support policies weakens for
positions as long as

871
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:56,050
it doesn't and went to get into that
what he'd even get into like spending

872
00:48:56,050 --> 00:48:56,690
money

873
00:48:56,690 --> 00:49:00,770
on support on support a certain policies
if it's this wasn't a partisan issue

874
00:49:00,770 --> 00:49:04,280
which these days everything is a
partisan issue yet to be really careful

875
00:49:04,280 --> 00:49:08,070
yet so you know watch the amount of
money yet you a lotta logging about

876
00:49:08,070 --> 00:49:11,470
so that if you know if some the IRS
wants to check up on that you have all

877
00:49:11,470 --> 00:49:12,780
the documentation show

878
00:49:12,780 --> 00:49:15,980
are this is not a major part of what
we're doing season

879
00:49:15,980 --> 00:49:19,470
now's okay I was asking he said stuff
that you had

880
00:49:19,470 --> 00:49:22,500
when so you can do any more like which
brings know how was that we can do any

881
00:49:22,500 --> 00:49:23,480
more interviews

882
00:49:23,480 --> 00:49:26,810
in raise a concern over whether we were
you know primarily

883
00:49:26,810 --> 00:49:30,520
are and your political advocacy
organization because we had

884
00:49:30,520 --> 00:49:33,960
are we had hosted hackers from other
areas

885
00:49:33,960 --> 00:49:38,500
who wanted to come forward media are the
rally for sanity

886
00:49:38,500 --> 00:49:42,440
on pro to bias event Daily Show that

887
00:49:42,440 --> 00:49:46,510
on and that was actually something that
I we had

888
00:49:46,510 --> 00:49:50,110
%uh promoted that on hack a day and they
actually had to close the comments

889
00:49:50,110 --> 00:49:50,900
thread because

890
00:49:50,900 --> 00:49:54,100
we got a lot of heat in the threads for

891
00:49:54,100 --> 00:49:57,210
for taking a political side and
supporting

892
00:49:57,210 --> 00:50:03,830
on no deletions you know rally for
sanity so

893
00:50:03,830 --> 00:50:06,490
clearly sanity is overrated apparently

894
00:50:06,490 --> 00:50:11,320
your okay %uh I'm I I have to apologize
that I am NOT

895

this ran bad guy and I don't get three
hours to have

896
00:50:15,290 --> 00:50:21,380
discussion here %ah he's always say the
same thing for three hours

897
00:50:21,380 --> 00:50:25,000
it's never ending its never-ending
ramming a yeah

898
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:30,170
so I'm so sorry we only have like two
minutes left to something

899
00:50:30,170 --> 00:50:33,500
up but we have at least to questions

900
00:50:33,500 --> 00:50:36,850
up one here you would a first mister

00:52:22,700 --> 00:52:26,279
years has an image on it had to make a
heritage like amateur 18

929
00:52:26,279 --> 00:52:30,970
black clubs known for forty years fifty
years an eight maintained by Ben

930
00:52:30,970 --> 00:52:35,769
arm and those clubs and even have like
hackerspace it seem like to be brother

931
00:52:35,769 --> 00:52:39,220
asset heavy you actually released space
you have the technology to have you

932
00:52:39,220 --> 00:52:39,799
there

933
00:52:39,799 --> 00:52:43,880
alarm radio clubs work with the don't
have power in space and they actually do

934
00:52:43,880 --> 00:52:45,960
a lot of education and presentation

935
00:52:45,960 --> 00:52:49,509
and grew three mention %uh working under
the lobby maturity clubs in closed

936
00:52:49,509 --> 00:52:51,190
communities what happens over time is

937
00:52:51,190 --> 00:52:54,450
amateur has gotten so big as far as
interest in sure way

938
00:52:54,450 --> 00:52:57,450
and scanners and making things breaking
things where have you

939
00:52:57,450 --> 00:53:01,660
day if your club get so big you get
special interest group simply spent of

940
00:53:01,660 --> 00:53:03,190
important it's a good thing so

941
00:53:03,190 --> 00:53:06,859
the key overlooking a lotta way to learn
from from passes trees mistakes

942
00:53:06,859 --> 00:53:10,660
nothing they've been successful bad but
something's been around for 34 years in

943
00:53:10,660 --> 00:53:11,509
club form

944
00:53:11,509 --> 00:53:15,380
I can gazetteer 9 I'm talking globe
leaves for the radio clubs

945
00:53:15,380 --> 00:53:19,099
thank you X okay and a

946
00:53:19,099 --> 00:53:22,549
that sell I'm on as much as

947
00:53:22,549 --> 00:53:28,269
hard the squatter entered a punk
movement in last 10 years there have

948
00:53:28,269 --> 00:53:29,579
been a pack and move men

949
00:53:29,579 --> 00:53:32,480
really would have been doing is like
trying to bridge that you know in both

950
00:53:32,480 --> 00:53:33,880
attackers bases and in

951
00:53:33,880 --> 00:53:37,309
and in collective houses in squads and I
think that

952
00:53:37,309 --> 00:53:41,539
we've actually com further along as
collective house movement

953
00:53:41,539 --> 00:53:45,529
then we have hackerspace movement as far
as

954
00:53:45,529 --> 00:53:48,769
hun as by genders concern at least

955
00:53:48,769 --> 00:53:52,140
on and what we one of the things that
was really

956
00:53:52,140 --> 00:53:57,519
heady was was splintering and becoming
model has you can happen in any city

957
00:53:57,519 --> 00:54:01,180
in the united states right now and they
can be three 250

958
00:54:01,180 --> 00:54:05,470
collected houses that are sort of like
roughly punk rock bass squatters

959
00:54:05,470 --> 00:54:09,180
hackers even you know and so if we
wanted more answers we might look

960
00:54:09,180 --> 00:54:09,880
towards

961
00:54:09,880 --> 00:54:14,259
you know what we've already done here in
the United States maybe you're in has
