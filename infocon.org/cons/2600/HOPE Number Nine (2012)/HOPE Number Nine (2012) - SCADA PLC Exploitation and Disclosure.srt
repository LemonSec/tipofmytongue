1
00:00:01,439 --> 00:00:05,609
you are you're about to see Scott and
healthy exploitation and

2
00:00:05,609 --> 00:00:09,210
disclosure I present to you Tiffany rad

3
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:16,210
take Newman and Mike Mary thank you very
much it's great to be back here at hope

4
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:24,019
this is my fourth hope am attending and
I think the third which I'm presenting

5
00:00:24,019 --> 00:00:24,490
and

6
00:00:24,490 --> 00:00:27,260
today we're doing a presentation
different than the others I've done i

7
00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:30,760
jus security research and also attorney
what you're gonna see today is just a

8
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:31,529
technical

9
00:00:31,529 --> 00:00:35,510
paper presentation were doing I have
from a group with independent security

10
00:00:35,510 --> 00:00:37,320
researchers have done stuff a SCADA

11
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:40,620
and Mike worries her talk about what
he's done with skaters well with his

12
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:41,930
company man security

13
00:00:41,930 --> 00:00:46,230
and I you'll be seeing the three of us
here and never gonna have Terry McCorkle

14
00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:47,539
inbuilt Billy Rios

15
00:00:47,539 --> 00:00:51,180
are talking with you via Skype am so
they don't they'll be up online they can

16
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:52,710
hear everything that we're saying we'll
be able

17
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:56,199
if you ask us questions at the end or
keep them they'll be able to hear those

18
00:00:56,199 --> 00:00:59,760
the purpose of this panel to talk about
the research that we did last year we're

19
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:00,339
gonna give us

20
00:01:00,340 --> 00:01:03,920
show two videos makes you do
international what he does

21
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:07,850
with mad we're gonna show a video that
was done by sixty minutes bob

22
00:01:07,850 --> 00:01:11,298
featuring mining team's research never
gonna show a video that actually from

23
00:01:11,299 --> 00:01:12,030
Derby Conn

24
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:15,780
and it's going to be a Terry McCorkle
Emily Rios and it's only a very short

25
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:18,689
introduction to this is the table work
that we've done with SCADA

26
00:01:18,689 --> 00:01:25,689
so home let's start there

27
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:55,060
sixty minutes overtime

28
00:01:55,060 --> 00:01:59,310
this is part of the actual Stuxnet

29
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:02,720
go that's correct this week on 60
minutes

30
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:06,289
steve Kroft reports on a mysterious
computer virus

31
00:02:06,290 --> 00:02:10,390
known as Stuxnet which was used to
attack a nuclear facility

32
00:02:10,390 --> 00:02:14,710
in Iran in fact it turned out to be the
most sophisticated cyber weapon ever

33
00:02:14,710 --> 00:02:15,500
invented

34
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:20,030
no one knows for sure who did it but we
do know where you can find the code

35
00:02:20,030 --> 00:02:23,400
on the Internet producer Graham masik

36
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:28,780
right now the Stuxnet code exist on some
hacking sites I was able

37
00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:33,000
to actually get a copy it wasn't super
easy but it took me about a week

38
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:37,450
unlike most computer viruses and worms
Stuxnet doesn't attack other computers

39
00:02:37,450 --> 00:02:38,260
in attacks

40
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:42,049
things there in the physical world
things like pipes and valves

41
00:02:42,050 --> 00:02:46,150
electrical systems that key is in attack
something called a PLC

42
00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:49,400
programmable logic controller there in
all sorts have

43
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:53,610
industrial devices they run conveyor
belts there on elevators there and

44
00:02:53,610 --> 00:02:54,600
traffic lights

45
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:58,510
and if you can get control over one of
these you can do all sorts of mischief

46
00:02:58,510 --> 00:03:03,200
there are many hackers now who are
trying to emulate per copy

47
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:06,420
Stuxnet basic attack so our

48
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:10,480
what if someone wrote a warmer a virus
and the perfect correctional facilities

49
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:12,739
that was our main question and

50
00:03:12,740 --> 00:03:16,660
one hacker Tiffany rad just showed how
she could hack im

51
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:19,710
to the computer systems that control

52
00:03:19,710 --> 00:03:23,550
prison doors and open all the doors
simultaneously close all the doors

53
00:03:23,550 --> 00:03:27,090
simultaneously trick

54
00:03:27,090 --> 00:03:30,440
the operators in the thinking the doors
were all out the closed when they were

55
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:31,500
really open

56
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:34,910
your own creativity is the only limit on
what you can do

57
00:03:34,910 --> 00:03:37,960
as you can see our PLC that we we
purchase on eBay and everything is up

58
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:38,780
here on the table

59
00:03:38,780 --> 00:03:42,500
if they're not hackers and kids in in
the in the basement and I'm their

60
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:43,900
pajamas just doing

61
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:47,280
miss malicious things as professionals
who work for companies

62
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:50,880
and look for vulnerabilities
specifically to

63
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:55,329
mitigate them to fix them miss chanute
mention Stuxnet earlier that Sean McGurk

64
00:03:55,330 --> 00:03:59,250
was a really interesting guy he was
until recently

65
00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:03,240
at the Department of Homeland Security
he was in charge protecting

66
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:06,880
the nation's critical infrastructure
from cyberattacks we know there's a guy

67
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:08,960
in Austin Dillon Beresford

68
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:13,170
Yeah Yeahs yes yes we've communicated
with on many occasions he shared a lot

69
00:04:13,170 --> 00:04:14,360
of his research with us

70
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:17,109
I don't know where stocks I came from
and no I didn't have anything to do with

71
00:04:17,108 --> 00:04:17,940
that site but

72
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:22,100
I just want to say one thing don't
underestimate the power the dark side

73
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:25,670
and there are a lot of people who are
out there were looking for ways to

74
00:04:25,670 --> 00:04:29,480
attack us and we here looking for ways
to attack

75
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:33,070
our adversaries it's important how this
information out there

76
00:04:33,070 --> 00:04:36,810
so that we can make thing safer for
everyone he's a

77
00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:41,580
very I energetic an enthusiastic
individual that found

78
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:45,669
that if you with with actually no
industrial control experience initially

79
00:04:45,670 --> 00:04:48,900
that if he started looking and probing
at these devices he could identify

80
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:50,120
vulnerabilities

81
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:54,650
he's just interested in this yes it was
an academic research project on his part

82
00:04:54,650 --> 00:04:57,970
and he had the time in the capability to
actually

83
00:04:57,970 --> 00:05:01,270
look at the devices in procurement
programme continuously

84
00:05:01,270 --> 00:05:04,320
I'm not here to freak anybody out but I
will tell you one thing

85
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:07,650
and what he said as if he were able to
take over certain PLC's

86
00:05:07,650 --> 00:05:11,140
for 24 hours he could cause explosions
my cuz pressure to build up inside a

87
00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:14,289
pipe and cause an explosion it goes back
and blows up an entire plant

88
00:05:14,290 --> 00:05:18,800
this act was was done by a 29 year old
kid with a tattoo on his neck

89
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:23,280
working from his living we want to take
it a step further we can get other PLC's

90
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:27,090
villains hack have these PLC's was so
extensive

91
00:05:27,090 --> 00:05:31,060
that the Department Homeland Security
and Siemens the maker the PLC's asked

92
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:31,440
him

93
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:34,770
to hold back on his talk that he was
about to give about this and he

94
00:05:34,770 --> 00:05:35,669
voluntarily

95
00:05:35,669 --> 00:05:39,789
agreed to do so to get Siemens more of a
chance to patch these

96
00:05:39,790 --> 00:05:44,729
these holes was there a moment that
really made you step back and think

97
00:05:44,729 --> 00:05:48,750
I'll this could be bad in this story the
thing that scared me the most

98
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:53,270
was the fact that this can be cheaply
done relatively cheaply down

99
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:56,549
a small country a failed state terrorist
group

100
00:05:56,550 --> 00:06:01,820
if it had a couple million dollars could
go out and hire people to recapped

101
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:05,130
and let me tell you what was incorrect
about this video

102
00:06:05,130 --> 00:06:09,440
it's not gonna take a couple million
dollars or nation-state it took a

103
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:13,630
literally a a bunch of us in the
basement for twenty five hundred dollars

104
00:06:13,630 --> 00:06:15,050
on our project doing it

105
00:06:15,050 --> 00:06:18,410
I'm doing this had the security research
we did another correction

106
00:06:18,410 --> 00:06:21,530
it was not just me on the team it was
unfortunate that so it was betrayed

107
00:06:21,530 --> 00:06:26,240
Teague Newman I was also on this project
my father John Strokes whose physical

108
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:29,890
security i engineer designer he was also
working on this with us

109
00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:33,740
as well as Dora SK to explore he was our
exploit writer who our

110
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:37,880
didn't want his name released so he's
Dora a so that's those are the

111
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:41,169
differences that we had from this video
but we want to give you an induction

112
00:06:41,169 --> 00:06:42,409
what even I did

113
00:06:42,410 --> 00:06:46,080
and now let me add turn this over to
Mike Michael talk to you about the work

114
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:46,669
that he did

115
00:06:46,669 --> 00:06:49,729
yes I've got a very different experience
and wanted this

116
00:06:49,729 --> 00:06:53,900
on Tiffany antique in the other guys are
all independent researchers and I demos

117
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:54,850
my research

118
00:06:54,850 --> 00:06:58,360
on with under the guise other companies
and

119
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:02,110
and for corporations so I think from a
disclosure perspective in a lot of those

120
00:07:02,110 --> 00:07:03,289
conversations I have

121
00:07:03,289 --> 00:07:06,960
a very different perspective than
everybody else in the POW and

122
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:10,610
you'll hear that perspective as we go
through this that's a a bit about me

123
00:07:10,610 --> 00:07:14,250
I'm I've been doing on research since
the 90's and have

124
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:18,130
made with skate & PLC's and not getting
might not be all season

125
00:07:18,130 --> 00:07:21,320
and everything in between cell hopefully
I bring in a different perspective to

126
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:21,630
that

127
00:07:21,630 --> 00:07:24,650
okay so

128
00:07:24,650 --> 00:07:28,810
right now what we have is we have a
video for billion Terry

129
00:07:28,810 --> 00:07:32,270
appear this is i just give you can intro
what they did

130
00:07:32,270 --> 00:07:36,190
their goal was to find 100 bucks in 100
days

131
00:07:36,190 --> 00:07:39,539
and so will play a few minutes at their
presentation they did

132
00:07:39,539 --> 00:07:42,669
Derby Conn last year see get to just do
that

133
00:07:42,669 --> 00:07:46,020
and we also have an article that I just
dropped for a second

134
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:50,680
on the guys actually had The Washington
Post public

135
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:53,130
publish an article about when the
particular vulnerabilities that they

136
00:07:53,130 --> 00:07:53,900
found

137
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:57,169
and I'll let them tell you about that
moment but for now

138
00:07:57,169 --> 00:08:04,169
play their video

139
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:09,680
Solis we set out to find some bugs and
we ask ourselves how we gonna do this

140
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:13,270
right make will we be able to just find

141
00:08:13,270 --> 00:08:20,270
bugs in

142
00:08:39,990 --> 00:08:40,680
were fresher

143
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:45,660
they found a lot a bug's basically

144
00:08:45,660 --> 00:08:49,510
all summarize it out what they did is
billion Terry when out

145
00:08:49,510 --> 00:08:53,880
and they they took a look at
specifically pretty well HM I software

146
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:57,740
and everything they got was demo
versions are open source

147
00:08:57,740 --> 00:09:01,630
and their goal was to find a hundred
bucks in a hundred days and so they

148
00:09:01,630 --> 00:09:03,090
start looking at all this through

149
00:09:03,090 --> 00:09:06,230
a couple various buzzing techniques and
I'm

150
00:09:06,230 --> 00:09:11,000
your you'll hear from them that the
actually found quite a bit more then

151
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,370
100 bucks all actually flip it over to
them right now

152
00:09:14,370 --> 00:09:21,370
and us if you can hear them via Skype

153
00:09:33,439 --> 00:09:40,439
at Terry's the the bug can you guys it's
not coming through

154
00:09:55,609 --> 00:09:57,729
okay well they're doing that let me tell
you a little bit about one of the things

155
00:09:57,729 --> 00:10:00,969
we wanted to discuss here today as when
you do this type the security research

156
00:10:00,969 --> 00:10:03,589
where there's some implications really
critical infrastructure

157
00:10:03,589 --> 00:10:07,189
how you handle this information how you
do this disclosure

158
00:10:07,189 --> 00:10:10,579
in particular when it's a government
assets like we were talking about things

159
00:10:10,579 --> 00:10:12,429
relating to nuclear power plants

160
00:10:12,429 --> 00:10:15,769
data centers and correctional facilities

161
00:10:15,769 --> 00:10:19,219
the reason that we chose correctional
facilities was that and

162
00:10:19,219 --> 00:10:23,399
my father was one of the the writers for
sneakers and he does a lot of

163
00:10:23,399 --> 00:10:26,619
and at assessments of ethical our
federal buildings

164
00:10:26,619 --> 00:10:30,099
and he knew that PLC's were used for
different kinds of things everything

165
00:10:30,099 --> 00:10:32,179
from climate control and data centers to
you

166
00:10:32,179 --> 00:10:36,899
to jails how the doors open with the
PLC's so we've kinda put this together I

167
00:10:36,899 --> 00:10:38,659
was doing some research on now

168
00:10:38,659 --> 00:10:42,389
on Stuxnet at my university and I'm
professor Ashton professor the

169
00:10:42,389 --> 00:10:45,729
University of Southern Maine computer
science department and we were talking

170
00:10:45,729 --> 00:10:46,419
about

171
00:10:46,419 --> 00:10:49,989
well this the Stuxnet exists will that
affect

172
00:10:49,989 --> 00:10:52,989
correctional facilities will it affect
nuclear power plants in this was very

173
00:10:52,989 --> 00:10:53,709
early

174
00:10:53,709 --> 00:10:57,459
about April of last year then I found
out the do wonders for was doing similar

175
00:10:57,459 --> 00:10:59,919
research we found out by reading an
article

176
00:10:59,919 --> 00:11:03,848
and in the newspaper that DHS had asked
Dylan please don't present about your

177
00:11:03,849 --> 00:11:04,509
research

178
00:11:04,509 --> 00:11:08,869
I he was gonna present takedown con and
they asked him to hold off on that

179
00:11:08,869 --> 00:11:09,779
presentation

180
00:11:09,779 --> 00:11:13,499
until they were ready for him to release
information publicly

181
00:11:13,499 --> 00:11:17,139
so that's one of the ways that Dylan had
a handle the disclosure I mean how do

182
00:11:17,139 --> 00:11:19,009
you tell the public about your research

183
00:11:19,009 --> 00:11:24,109
I'm I think we're OK nothing for ready
that's at but area and Billy talk about

184
00:11:24,109 --> 00:11:27,059
their work and then we'll get back to
the a discussion about how to disclose

185
00:11:27,059 --> 00:11:28,209
the step information

186
00:11:28,209 --> 00:11:33,739
remember up her

187
00:11:33,739 --> 00:11:38,019
in great so

188
00:11:38,019 --> 00:11:41,419
is a term for all basically with you

189
00:11:41,419 --> 00:11:45,098
like like the ghost and we set out fine
some bugs are

190
00:11:45,099 --> 00:11:49,009
essentially we had a goal by 100 and

191
00:11:49,009 --> 00:11:52,909
I think that day ordered over a thousand
58s

192
00:11:52,909 --> 00:11:55,968
her ice yes sir and

193
00:11:55,969 --> 00:11:59,609
the main reason we went to rise yes sir
or disclosure process would be

194
00:11:59,609 --> 00:12:02,709
the you vendors is pretty or and the

195
00:12:02,709 --> 00:12:06,759
you know you never know we're gonna
response you its so went through

196
00:12:06,759 --> 00:12:10,369
ICS third but and or the disparate

197
00:12:10,369 --> 00:12:15,249
benders unit at between running back and
to help validate

198
00:12:15,249 --> 00:12:19,129
impacted or anything like that that they
were row

199
00:12:19,129 --> 00:12:23,829
I'm and I will at Billys it worked there
about the Washington Post article that

200
00:12:23,829 --> 00:12:24,619
got this order

201
00:12:24,619 --> 00:12:28,699
everyone can you hear me this is very

202
00:12:28,699 --> 00:12:33,879
perfect I'm yeah but the Washington Post
article word

203
00:12:33,879 --> 00:12:38,229
it details a early that we found in the
tritium Niagara for more

204
00:12:38,229 --> 00:12:41,369
and I'm it's it's pretty that barbara
Lee and I want to get into technical

205
00:12:41,369 --> 00:12:42,559
details consider

206
00:12:42,559 --> 00:12:46,988
this quarter panel but you know we're
kinda shocking that we reached out at

207
00:12:46,989 --> 00:12:47,970
DHS

208
00:12:47,970 --> 00:12:51,579
and I we reached out to the vendor they
basically didn't want to accept

209
00:12:51,579 --> 00:12:53,509
responsibility for fixing the bug

210
00:12:53,509 --> 00:12:56,589
right so I'm we try to present a case
just

211
00:12:56,589 --> 00:13:00,499
let them know what the risks were and
how prevail in bisbee systems were on

212
00:13:00,499 --> 00:13:03,619
basing and facing the Internet and I'm

213
00:13:03,619 --> 00:13:07,649
and even after that you know seems like
a really didn't care concern in this

214
00:13:07,649 --> 00:13:09,499
wasn't the first time we are encountered
such

215
00:13:09,499 --> 00:13:12,919
such attitudes you know it's like they
have this culture within the industrial

216
00:13:12,919 --> 00:13:14,728
control systems world were

217
00:13:14,729 --> 00:13:17,939
are times I just say you know what
that's not my problem that the customer

218
00:13:17,939 --> 00:13:18,669
problem

219
00:13:18,669 --> 00:13:23,149
arm been configured properly or we
provide guidance that prevents

220
00:13:23,149 --> 00:13:27,049
you know explications a business type 2
bugs and it kinda puts the

221
00:13:27,049 --> 00:13:28,749
responsibility on to the customer

222
00:13:28,749 --> 00:13:33,179
to secure a good is poor design so you
know after many many months

223
00:13:33,179 --> 00:13:37,279
you know we decided enough is enough so
we decide to you know go public with

224
00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:38,999
summers information and and and

225
00:13:38,999 --> 00:13:42,669
that's where we see the Washington Post
article article drop so that kinda bar

226
00:13:42,669 --> 00:13:43,679
perspective one

227
00:13:43,679 --> 00:13:46,709
the whole disclosure process and
industrial control system

228
00:13:46,709 --> 00:13:51,999
one interesting thing that I'd like to
point out

229
00:13:51,999 --> 00:13:55,379
is it when you look across the board
here all

230
00:13:55,379 --> 00:13:59,669
us you know dawn who couldn't be here
when it comes down to is

231
00:13:59,669 --> 00:14:03,909
worthy original things that the vendors
were sane is it would take a

232
00:14:03,909 --> 00:14:05,218
nation-state to do this

233
00:14:05,219 --> 00:14:08,219
and I think that you know realistically

234
00:14:08,219 --> 00:14:11,850
Iran of who is Dylan or denies group

235
00:14:11,850 --> 00:14:16,109
but we probably spent the most money and
we're talking a few thousand dollars

236
00:14:16,109 --> 00:14:20,289
so like a Terry and Billy you

237
00:14:20,289 --> 00:14:23,869
Adam

238
00:14:23,869 --> 00:14:28,309
yeah okay asset they had to spend
anything at all

239
00:14:28,309 --> 00:14:31,829
now we actually did he disbanded the a

240
00:14:31,829 --> 00:14:35,059
or the research it I think the biggest
thing was

241
00:14:35,059 --> 00:14:38,069
are and everywhere to you

242
00:14:38,069 --> 00:14:42,089
but you married I'd airplanes in a jobs

243
00:14:42,089 --> 00:14:47,109
and we just found are nights you can't
you

244
00:14:47,109 --> 00:14:50,579
yeah i i just want to echo workers are
arm and back

245
00:14:50,579 --> 00:14:53,749
we made it a point not to take any
sponsorship

246
00:14:53,749 --> 00:14:57,119
are not to take any work time to do this
research

247
00:14:57,119 --> 00:15:00,679
at the end of the day we want people to
know that but anyone can do this

248
00:15:00,679 --> 00:15:01,249
rhetoric

249
00:15:01,249 --> 00:15:04,889
anyone can be this right are they don't
have any kind sponsorship whatsoever

250
00:15:04,889 --> 00:15:07,019
dont have a kinda morning

251
00:15:07,019 --> 00:15:09,529
I'm all they have to have as a
willingness and some time to look into

252
00:15:09,529 --> 00:15:10,449
the star

253
00:15:10,449 --> 00:15:14,299
and no prescrip line what we found the
scary thing though is if you actually

254
00:15:14,299 --> 00:15:15,519
did put some money too

255
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:18,959
you know i mean weird tho we see the
resultant

256
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:22,329
stuff like this and I've worked on
projects that actually did have funding

257
00:15:22,329 --> 00:15:26,220
and you know that with that were and in
some cases vendor sponsored in some

258
00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:28,949
cases other people's months ago when you
actually put some money in some real

259
00:15:28,949 --> 00:15:29,869
time in some

260
00:15:29,869 --> 00:15:33,669
you know we're not just skirt around is
in our basement in the of hours

261
00:15:33,669 --> 00:15:37,259
on it's it's scary it gets very real
fast

262
00:15:37,259 --> 00:15:40,899
yeah I can imagine and the work that we
did

263
00:15:40,899 --> 00:15:44,169
add me antique it was on we did this
after hours

264
00:15:44,169 --> 00:15:47,799
a and I have to say to that we have with
some of us work for large companies

265
00:15:47,799 --> 00:15:50,809
I'm including my Terry and believe this
is not at all other

266
00:15:50,809 --> 00:15:54,549
the reflection of our work 'em employers
we did this on our own

267
00:15:54,549 --> 00:15:57,699
so it something that didn't take up a
lot of time to do

268
00:15:57,699 --> 00:16:01,099
and I what has this question actually
two billion Terry in Mt no answer how we

269
00:16:01,099 --> 00:16:03,349
did to you maybe make you can talk about
it but

270
00:16:03,349 --> 00:16:08,889
how was your experience Terry Billy with
them dealing with on the ICS group

271
00:16:08,889 --> 00:16:12,459
which it stands for industrial control
systems

272
00:16:12,459 --> 00:16:16,869
yeah I can speak to that and so I'm
really pushed all about bugs 30

273
00:16:16,869 --> 00:16:18,569
industrial control system sir team

274
00:16:18,569 --> 00:16:22,639
which is odd which is an art the DHS
writer art department alright security

275
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:26,989
and the reason we get back it's because
the control systems were over still very

276
00:16:26,989 --> 00:16:27,759
old school

277
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:31,299
you know and the last thing we want to
do your wires as independent security

278
00:16:31,299 --> 00:16:33,309
researchers we don't want to stand

279
00:16:33,309 --> 00:16:36,978
and email to these vendors from our
gmail account

280
00:16:36,979 --> 00:16:40,619
arm and get a response that basically
says hey thanks a lot better lawyer up

281
00:16:40,619 --> 00:16:42,919
right like that's the last thing we
wanted

282
00:16:42,919 --> 00:16:47,079
so are we did or decide to do just route
everything through dhis

283
00:16:47,079 --> 00:16:50,379
now where we have this kinda like a
neutral third party that can do the

284
00:16:50,379 --> 00:16:51,999
interfacing for vendors for us

285
00:16:51,999 --> 00:16:55,529
error in fact when we first started we
said hey you know what

286
00:16:55,529 --> 00:16:58,829
we're not talking directly to any
vendors if you want to talk to us

287
00:16:58,829 --> 00:17:01,889
you need to talk to DHS first and your
chest wall

288
00:17:01,889 --> 00:17:05,608
get the communications to us cerro now
and that gives us a little bit of a

289
00:17:05,608 --> 00:17:06,569
proper

290
00:17:06,569 --> 00:17:09,490
so we can figure out you know which
companies are security researcher

291
00:17:09,490 --> 00:17:10,368
primary

292
00:17:10,368 --> 00:17:14,608
and which ones are not right so and the
second piece to that airs

293
00:17:14,608 --> 00:17:17,529
are following up on this stuff when you
have a thousand different blogs that

294
00:17:17,529 --> 00:17:19,990
spread across hundreds of different
vendors

295
00:17:19,990 --> 00:17:23,618
following up in keeping track at the
stop it's actually a large after

296
00:17:23,618 --> 00:17:26,888
and we don't want to do that right last
thing we want to respect our weekends

297
00:17:26,889 --> 00:17:27,709
and nights

298
00:17:27,709 --> 00:17:31,039
managing spreadsheet about when you to
follow up with and whether or not

299
00:17:31,039 --> 00:17:33,740
someone responder weather gonna issue a
patch

300
00:17:33,740 --> 00:17:36,820
and so we kinda through all that work at
DHS insider who

301
00:17:36,820 --> 00:17:39,629
you keep track of this stuff we're not
gonna keep track of this stuff right

302
00:17:39,629 --> 00:17:41,740
American trucker or that we find

303
00:17:41,740 --> 00:17:46,179
interesting weather across a thousand
barger 100 her vendors

304
00:17:46,179 --> 00:17:49,179
it's just really difficult right we
don't we don't want to get into that

305
00:17:49,179 --> 00:17:53,200
error i think is for that role girls
they did a really good job

306
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:56,240
you know arm I I do think they had her
hands tied

307
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:59,929
in in a couple instances nowhere like
the vendors not respond to every day no

308
00:17:59,929 --> 00:18:02,220
one accepts responsibility for the buck

309
00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:05,590
you know what you do then right and I'm
and I don't know or if we

310
00:18:05,590 --> 00:18:09,428
entirely figured that out yet but are
you know that the initial

311
00:18:09,429 --> 00:18:13,039
I think use for DHS nice yessir I think
I was mad

312
00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:16,269
wonderfully you know they manage all the
tracking

313
00:18:16,269 --> 00:18:19,559
they did all that but ping you know
every couple weeks whatever

314
00:18:19,559 --> 00:18:23,590
they gave a status I'm and and I was
pretty good I really enjoy that

315
00:18:23,590 --> 00:18:26,730
ida I'd like to point out one thing also
with the

316
00:18:26,730 --> 00:18:31,619
regards to Terry in billy's work so you
may have heard that term

317
00:18:31,619 --> 00:18:34,990
that's been freshly cleaned because this

318
00:18:34,990 --> 00:18:38,000
for everday bugs

319
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,879
a billy Terry what are you guys when you
guys pick that you just described

320
00:18:41,879 --> 00:18:45,639
that loss in area right there with
regards to those

321
00:18:45,639 --> 00:18:48,710
Search Server Brevard a buddy actually

322
00:18:48,710 --> 00:18:53,000
was originally Korean ever first time
we've heard it we're actually help

323
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,159
smokers cigars on about me

324
00:18:55,159 --> 00:18:58,710
at the SP or conference in Miami and

325
00:18:58,710 --> 00:19:02,799
there is is actually re wat min that
said

326
00:19:02,799 --> 00:19:07,369
he said is preferably bugs are eaten so
when I had the opportunity talking to

327
00:19:07,369 --> 00:19:08,619
somebody

328
00:19:08,619 --> 00:19:12,668
I'm they're basically like I started
using that term because

329
00:19:12,669 --> 00:19:17,570
really it tennis sums up what happens a
lot of vendors are never gonna fix these

330
00:19:17,570 --> 00:19:18,689
issues

331
00:19:18,690 --> 00:19:22,419
and those in our Customer Advisory their
literally like a year

332
00:19:22,419 --> 00:19:27,799
wish your application program and you're
never going to have a patch where

333
00:19:27,799 --> 00:19:31,039
in a I don't know I mean its

334
00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:34,289
it's frustrating for for researcher
that's turned

335
00:19:34,289 --> 00:19:38,369
you know get things fixed have them come
back to back in response and

336
00:19:38,369 --> 00:19:42,329
basically put it on a customer saying
you know you're always going to have

337
00:19:42,329 --> 00:19:44,109
this issue

338
00:19:44,109 --> 00:19:47,289
we taken I handle this a little bit of a
different way we didn't go directly

339
00:19:47,289 --> 00:19:47,889
through

340
00:19:47,889 --> 00:19:52,490
ICS sir that reason being is up what
we're looking at work correctional

341
00:19:52,490 --> 00:19:56,309
facilities so we reached out to therapy
or prisons didn't get much RAM

342
00:19:56,309 --> 00:20:00,579
a response back at that time so we talk
to some contacts to you know both are in

343
00:20:00,579 --> 00:20:02,158
the Washington DC area

344
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:05,639
and we wanted to tell the US government
about this this is one of these things

345
00:20:05,639 --> 00:20:06,250
where

346
00:20:06,250 --> 00:20:10,510
if we didn't a and we we felt like if it
came out in the press in like the wrong

347
00:20:10,510 --> 00:20:11,129
light

348
00:20:11,129 --> 00:20:14,549
and the government didn't know about it
we have some some problems

349
00:20:14,549 --> 00:20:18,750
so a meeting was set up in Washington DC
and an agency and we said hey this is

350
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:19,710
what we've done

351
00:20:19,710 --> 00:20:23,309
we're gonna go public with it is that
okay

352
00:20:23,309 --> 00:20:25,859
it was really wanted these things were
all of us walked into the meeting

353
00:20:25,859 --> 00:20:27,609
thinking okay if they're going in

354
00:20:27,609 --> 00:20:30,889
if they're gonna tell us we're not ready
we knew that happen did Ellen

355
00:20:30,889 --> 00:20:34,049
a about two months earlier we're going
away

356
00:20:34,049 --> 00:20:37,839
but they actually said you know what go
ahead and talk about it

357
00:20:37,839 --> 00:20:41,379
a which which give us a lot of like
relief that we could go to

358
00:20:41,379 --> 00:20:45,619
Def Con and out not feel like we're
gonna get a cease and desist order

359
00:20:45,619 --> 00:20:48,379
it was like a little bit the back of our
minds are alike are a date think that'll

360
00:20:48,379 --> 00:20:49,419
be fine

361
00:20:49,419 --> 00:20:52,480
on and wonder if they are you can talk
about Mike how the government can handle

362
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:54,379
some other work that you do actually
before

363
00:20:54,379 --> 00:20:57,480
before that I taxes that same gel a
small the gas

364
00:20:57,480 --> 00:21:02,450
because on the first time I reported one
is both the vendors 2004

365
00:21:02,450 --> 00:21:05,700
and so I'm and can in some ways the old
guy the group but

366
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:08,950
on things like I see a certain stuff
like that them

367
00:21:08,950 --> 00:21:12,369
we didn't have any in that so I i do
these vendors and and somebody I

368
00:21:12,369 --> 00:21:15,779
it was in a military earlier mentioned
something about the attitude you get

369
00:21:15,779 --> 00:21:17,109
from a lot of these vendors

370
00:21:17,109 --> 00:21:20,740
and I know a bunch have quote-unquote
for everyday bugs that have existed

371
00:21:20,740 --> 00:21:23,119
since 2004 2005

372
00:21:23,119 --> 00:21:26,760
bed I think me in the vendor the only
ones that know about the net

373
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:30,419
right and and they have no intention
ever fixing it never well

374
00:21:30,419 --> 00:21:34,389
and to the point that was made earlier
I'm bound by the NDA's irv

375
00:21:34,389 --> 00:21:38,240
my company's at the time I can talk
about them

376
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:42,379
and the vendor never well so nobody's
gonna know that until somebody down

377
00:21:42,379 --> 00:21:46,279
and and their attitudes back then I mean
people at least opening up into the sea

378
00:21:46,279 --> 00:21:50,389
busy bee a the 60 minutes report this
their wall street journal her

379
00:21:50,389 --> 00:21:52,940
Wall Street Journal coverage the
Washington Post governor is covering it

380
00:21:52,940 --> 00:21:54,129
now

381
00:21:54,129 --> 00:21:57,419
hmmm back then these guys their attitude
was just

382
00:21:57,419 --> 00:22:01,809
hey you know with if you are putting
this thing on the internet unity it

383
00:22:01,809 --> 00:22:04,849
and you while I might agree with that

384
00:22:04,849 --> 00:22:08,950
doesn't stop customers from doing

385
00:22:08,950 --> 00:22:12,750
wanted the interesting things that he
can I found after we did our research

386
00:22:12,750 --> 00:22:17,559
is at conferences are usually shy say
after conferences were on our way out

387
00:22:17,559 --> 00:22:21,470
someone to stop us and say hey I can't
tell you who I am on my work for

388
00:22:21,470 --> 00:22:24,710
but I just wanna tell you I'm really
glad some independent security

389
00:22:24,710 --> 00:22:27,730
researcher such as your group would you
don't have NDA's

390
00:22:27,730 --> 00:22:31,320
you can go out and tell people about
this morning I'm can

391
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:35,510
customers consumers because he said I've
known about this for so many years just

392
00:22:35,510 --> 00:22:37,730
like Mike saying I couldn't tell anyone

393
00:22:37,730 --> 00:22:40,940
now we get into this interesting debate
about know is security through obscurity

394
00:22:40,940 --> 00:22:43,599
working I believe that I love us

395
00:22:43,599 --> 00:22:46,689
talking here on this this panel would
say it's not working

396
00:22:46,690 --> 00:22:50,339
for ICS and in fact when you have
something such as very important

397
00:22:50,339 --> 00:22:51,849
critical infrastructure up

398
00:22:51,849 --> 00:22:55,589
and its I it's more important we believe
to get the word out these are

399
00:22:55,589 --> 00:22:56,730
vulnerabilities

400
00:22:56,730 --> 00:23:00,460
because from what we found a lease in a
correctional institute said we talk to

401
00:23:00,460 --> 00:23:00,829
you

402
00:23:00,829 --> 00:23:04,339
and to some government agencies here and
these and manage these

403
00:23:04,339 --> 00:23:08,059
a lot of them sort of had an idea with
SCADA was didn't know was in their

404
00:23:08,059 --> 00:23:11,299
facilities and in particular the people
that were working in a correctional

405
00:23:11,299 --> 00:23:13,879
facilities when we get it got it or have
one of them

406
00:23:13,879 --> 00:23:17,710
in the United States they were checking
email and Twitter from the control

407
00:23:17,710 --> 00:23:19,779
computer for the PLC's

408
00:23:19,779 --> 00:23:22,909
that's not a big no no yet those types
of things are

409
00:23:22,909 --> 00:23:26,519
easy to fix in the sense that you tell
people back computer

410
00:23:26,519 --> 00:23:29,820
there's a reason that this acceptable
use policy exists

411
00:23:29,820 --> 00:23:33,589
follow it or you can have all the
prisoners xscape in and got a real big

412
00:23:33,589 --> 00:23:34,279
problem

413
00:23:34,279 --> 00:23:38,409
they they got that so telling them you
have these vulnerabilities

414
00:23:38,409 --> 00:23:41,849
really was was rewarding for us as a
group for the research we did

415
00:23:41,849 --> 00:23:45,178
that it looks like some changes are
being made you know it violates

416
00:23:45,179 --> 00:23:48,609
can change the culture mean I at war
story for a second on

417
00:23:48,609 --> 00:23:51,839
to give you guys an idea of how
ridiculous some other stuff is and

418
00:23:51,839 --> 00:23:53,918
especially in the control systems are
opening

419
00:23:53,919 --> 00:23:57,049
you guys kinda been a funny noise when
they talked about to

420
00:23:57,049 --> 00:24:00,859
check email but at let me give you a
story from 2005

421
00:24:00,859 --> 00:24:04,609
I was they had a vulnerability research
for scanning vendor and we did a lot of

422
00:24:04,609 --> 00:24:05,389
stuff we would

423
00:24:05,389 --> 00:24:08,909
drop the scanning tools into
environments in just

424
00:24:08,909 --> 00:24:12,659
certified you know set it and forget it
and and start knocking stuff over

425
00:24:12,659 --> 00:24:17,629
and I went to any major vendor and who
was dealing with

426
00:24:17,629 --> 00:24:21,119
who had a control system in a major
hospital to control the budget

427
00:24:21,119 --> 00:24:24,960
medical devices we were just destroying
these things like you know you turn on

428
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:25,750
the scanning tool

429
00:24:25,750 --> 00:24:30,149
and all these medical devices with a
shot of with no idea what was going on

430
00:24:30,149 --> 00:24:33,669
and sitting with the had architect this

431
00:24:33,669 --> 00:24:38,019
and he said you don't connect to port
10000 do you

432
00:24:38,019 --> 00:24:41,470
and I said yeah any he said

433
00:24:41,470 --> 00:24:45,879
while you can't do that I and I say why
not

434
00:24:45,879 --> 00:24:50,909
and he said that's the shutdown poor

435
00:24:50,909 --> 00:24:55,339
I kid you not I i couldn't make this up
if you if you open a TCP connection to

436
00:24:55,339 --> 00:24:58,879
port 10000 the entire system shutdown

437
00:24:58,879 --> 00:25:02,039
that's the kinda stuff that these guys
were doing is like why would you ever do

438
00:25:02,039 --> 00:25:03,099
that

439
00:25:03,099 --> 00:25:07,168
and and so that bid that this kind
research comes out actually change the

440
00:25:07,169 --> 00:25:09,769
culture a whole lot they can't be that
stupid anymore

441
00:25:09,769 --> 00:25:12,879
that's not really stopping them but
that's not the point

442
00:25:12,879 --> 00:25:16,039
they can try though big exactly

443
00:25:16,039 --> 00:25:20,039
you know it's interesting to is morrow
to be United's research

444
00:25:20,039 --> 00:25:23,750
you know after Stuxnet everyone pretty
well herded you know SCADA

445
00:25:23,750 --> 00:25:26,879
ICS power plants water treatment

446
00:25:26,879 --> 00:25:30,829
et cetera et cetera and wanna bar things
was want to see where else

447
00:25:30,829 --> 00:25:34,918
was that people probably wouldn't expect
in wind up taking a look at prisons

448
00:25:34,919 --> 00:25:38,329
on a note in the videos show uterine
billy's

449
00:25:38,329 --> 00:25:42,178
Terry talks about a lot of things like
alright Budweiser plant

450
00:25:42,179 --> 00:25:45,559
uses it cell I mean this stuff is
literally

451
00:25:45,559 --> 00:25:49,329
everywhere it's in manufacturing
stranded here sharing City

452
00:25:49,329 --> 00:25:54,210
yeah it's its its everywhere amusement
parks I mean

453
00:25:54,210 --> 00:25:57,220
there was a lot of places you know that

454
00:25:57,220 --> 00:26:00,899
I'll think people would have guessed
that it was initially

455
00:26:00,899 --> 00:26:05,099
cell those common interesting thing to
see over the course the past year all

456
00:26:05,099 --> 00:26:06,689
the different places they

457
00:26:06,690 --> 00:26:09,700
the stars become public where actually
is located two

458
00:26:09,700 --> 00:26:12,799
so think I think also arm

459
00:26:12,799 --> 00:26:16,960
I wanna things that I'll a lot up normal
companies don't

460
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:20,500
consider themselves babbit system very
and

461
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:24,019
they were other things that I went out
as data center

462
00:26:24,019 --> 00:26:27,609
you have HB act and yet building
management

463
00:26:27,609 --> 00:26:33,970
in the water the and it and these storms
EMA systems made by the same manufacture

464
00:26:33,970 --> 00:26:39,549
run though it that goes down think about
the ramifications without having your

465
00:26:39,549 --> 00:26:40,879
datacenter

466
00:26:40,879 --> 00:26:44,799
you know a while are hip if you have
porn

467
00:26:44,799 --> 00:26:49,569
you can run your machine though exits
were things that I was trying to hit on

468
00:26:49,569 --> 00:26:50,549
me is

469
00:26:50,549 --> 00:26:53,869
that way people understand that this
isn't just

470
00:26:53,869 --> 00:26:57,629
in a conveyor belt systems are some
automated system error its

471
00:26:57,629 --> 00:27:00,649
new systems are running like building
management

472
00:27:00,649 --> 00:27:04,029
and its it's pretty per

473
00:27:04,029 --> 00:27:08,379
yeah absolutely in where the things if
you take a look at aryan please

474
00:27:08,379 --> 00:27:10,869
presentation

475
00:27:10,869 --> 00:27:14,489
Terry talks about that in there that was
a Terry the average

476
00:27:14,489 --> 00:27:19,159
time to shut down once a date is a loser
schooling is like

477
00:27:19,159 --> 00:27:23,489
three minutes 29 seconds does that sound
right yeah there's a report that I read

478
00:27:23,489 --> 00:27:24,710
they had that in there

479
00:27:24,710 --> 00:27:28,519
and their I i've actually been in a data
center where their

480
00:27:28,519 --> 00:27:32,669
wrench set there are and you see people
running around frantically trying to

481
00:27:32,669 --> 00:27:35,299
turn off machines before the overtly

482
00:27:35,299 --> 00:27:38,679
its it's an interesting in Norwalk or

483
00:27:38,679 --> 00:27:41,690
are and that was a related to my
researcher or where

484
00:27:41,690 --> 00:27:45,849
are they getting shut it down but you
know her

485
00:27:45,849 --> 00:27:50,039
a so yeah just is something did to keep
in mind it

486
00:27:50,039 --> 00:27:53,580
Burgos for the people that are like I
don't have been

487
00:27:53,580 --> 00:27:56,989
I I think most companies have real in
their in their environment

488
00:27:56,989 --> 00:28:00,539
may just don't really like that last
summer

489
00:28:00,539 --> 00:28:03,669
with all busted this type independent
security research

490
00:28:03,669 --> 00:28:06,899
a.m. about ten to twelve months ago when
a lot of it became public for the first

491
00:28:06,899 --> 00:28:07,929
time

492
00:28:07,929 --> 00:28:11,249
I wanted to ask and I'll talk about how
our research may have changed some

493
00:28:11,249 --> 00:28:11,960
things bed

494
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:15,179
Terry and Billy did you find that some
changes have been made

495
00:28:15,179 --> 00:28:18,570
I'm as a result of your research like
you do with the vendors are the

496
00:28:18,570 --> 00:28:19,139
government

497
00:28:19,139 --> 00:28:23,450
I mean do you have any comments about
that

498
00:28:23,450 --> 00:28:26,450
yeah I could take that there are some
changes actually

499
00:28:26,450 --> 00:28:30,849
I'm there some policy changes from
various government agencies some other

500
00:28:30,849 --> 00:28:34,279
summer which will actually made public I
think you're in the next couple weeks

501
00:28:34,279 --> 00:28:35,559
which is awesome

502
00:28:35,559 --> 00:28:39,619
I'm some other vendors I respect the
read operation some changes in attitude

503
00:28:39,619 --> 00:28:43,119
I'm especially after you know they they
have their dirty laundry aired

504
00:28:43,119 --> 00:28:46,440
in a public you know in the mean you're
somewhere or something like that

505
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:49,519
but I'm I think what are the things that
we're most proud are theirs

506
00:28:49,519 --> 00:28:52,379
when you take a look at that number
researchers that are working at

507
00:28:52,379 --> 00:28:54,269
industrial control systems

508
00:28:54,269 --> 00:28:58,679
HM I am a stalker that's associated with
that it just dramatically increased over

509
00:28:58,679 --> 00:28:59,679
last year

510
00:28:59,679 --> 00:29:02,679
you know our I know what I was looking
at the ice yessir

511
00:29:02,679 --> 00:29:06,529
your marquee monitor and a they have
recognition for various researchers

512
00:29:06,529 --> 00:29:09,809
you know at the time it was like by
people now

513
00:29:09,809 --> 00:29:13,399
I'm and now if you look at it it's like
burying people or forty people were some

514
00:29:13,399 --> 00:29:14,869
nice pretty people

515
00:29:14,869 --> 00:29:18,149
and so on and i'm happy to see that you
know I hope more people continue to

516
00:29:18,149 --> 00:29:18,970
shine a light

517
00:29:18,970 --> 00:29:22,139
underscore industry you know and get
them to where they need to be

518
00:29:22,139 --> 00:29:26,210
are light years behind modern ha
particular your light years behind

519
00:29:26,210 --> 00:29:26,940
modern

520
00:29:26,940 --> 00:29:29,950
your security practices what you see in
other places

521
00:29:29,950 --> 00:29:33,779
cerro are we still got a long ways to go
you know but I think we're making some

522
00:29:33,779 --> 00:29:35,119
progress I just hope it's

523
00:29:35,119 --> 00:29:39,639
it's fast enough one nurse P for a
second half

524
00:29:39,639 --> 00:29:43,029
Dylan who unfortunately couldn't make it
on

525
00:29:43,029 --> 00:29:46,229
I know I was speaking on the phone with
him on

526
00:29:46,229 --> 00:29:49,389
my about two weeks ago now we're just
discussing some

527
00:29:49,389 --> 00:29:54,200
exploit in general and I know that he'd
said a lot of the stuff he found last

528
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:55,889
year still hasn't been patched

529
00:29:55,889 --> 00:30:00,710
and actually if you check his Twitter
feed I believe like two days ago he jus

530
00:30:00,710 --> 00:30:04,690
are released the whole buncha Metasploit
modules for some other stuff that he did

531
00:30:04,690 --> 00:30:05,759
last year

532
00:30:05,759 --> 00:30:09,960
I think may be potentially to urge the
patches along

533
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:13,719
did yes gonna say some very good pen
testing tools to come out so if you're

534
00:30:13,719 --> 00:30:16,249
in that industry during penetration
testing and doing

535
00:30:16,249 --> 00:30:19,830
large facility tests are you a lot more
tools now to do it

536
00:30:19,830 --> 00:30:25,070
so where from bird perspective that this
have some models and Metis when what not

537
00:30:25,070 --> 00:30:27,279
to help us do our job to make things
safer

538
00:30:27,279 --> 00:30:31,239
so when people do somebody's releases on
we enter able to turn that

539
00:30:31,239 --> 00:30:35,450
their tools and make things up make
things better and we we found after our

540
00:30:35,450 --> 00:30:36,109
research

541
00:30:36,109 --> 00:30:39,269
is that a the correctional facilities
have actually

542
00:30:39,269 --> 00:30:42,299
up some of their and some other funding
that they have

543
00:30:42,299 --> 00:30:45,349
for information technology when the
things that he looked at as

544
00:30:45,349 --> 00:30:48,509
with the networks is how things are
connected within the prison like you

545
00:30:48,509 --> 00:30:51,349
should not be able to get from the
commissary like I'm computers they're

546
00:30:51,349 --> 00:30:52,529
like for ordering food

547
00:30:52,529 --> 00:30:56,029
into the PLC computers we we did see
that I'm so you

548
00:30:56,029 --> 00:30:59,429
that shouldn't be connected %uh so
they're looking right now at how things

549
00:30:59,429 --> 00:31:00,599
are set up with eighty

550
00:31:00,599 --> 00:31:03,689
and they're doing more for convergence
to with physical security also with

551
00:31:03,690 --> 00:31:05,570
electronic and computer security

552
00:31:05,570 --> 00:31:08,820
that these you can't just say the
physical security is something else and

553
00:31:08,820 --> 00:31:10,320
compare securities here

554
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:13,820
there together especially when you have
you know a close circuit TV that's on

555
00:31:13,820 --> 00:31:15,330
the same type of system

556
00:31:15,330 --> 00:31:18,989
so they're really looking at more
Bahamas to give you how these facilities

557
00:31:18,989 --> 00:31:20,499
are set up so we're glad that

558
00:31:20,499 --> 00:31:24,029
have a lot of states and clean when we
did our tour were able to get some more

559
00:31:24,029 --> 00:31:24,789
funding

560
00:31:24,789 --> 00:31:28,190
and we're not we're never suggesting rip
out the PLC is because we we know that

561
00:31:28,190 --> 00:31:28,999
right now

562
00:31:28,999 --> 00:31:32,960
the vendors I don't really have a lot of
fixes for them I came from what we've

563
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:35,299
heard they're working on it but we're
not quite there hit

564
00:31:35,299 --> 00:31:38,469
but until then physical security might
be

565
00:31:38,469 --> 00:31:41,509
and training might be the way to kinda
patch in some way

566
00:31:41,509 --> 00:31:45,039
above the vulnerabilities we have now
let your people know the guards were

567
00:31:45,039 --> 00:31:46,349
working in the control booth

568
00:31:46,349 --> 00:31:50,299
what you know don't check your email on
their computer ever don't bring in USB

569
00:31:50,299 --> 00:31:54,249
you know just just don't do it and then
also the physical security

570
00:31:54,249 --> 00:31:58,039
we personally in some way it actually
should have been in that control center

571
00:31:58,039 --> 00:32:00,690
either we were just security researchers
on it or

572
00:32:00,690 --> 00:32:04,899
so I'm walking down where you have like
switches for trains and trams in like

573
00:32:04,899 --> 00:32:05,729
new york city

574
00:32:05,729 --> 00:32:08,789
knowing where these are and making sure
you're better physical security are

575
00:32:08,789 --> 00:32:10,210
kinda patch summer that where

576
00:32:10,210 --> 00:32:13,729
not Patchett bed kinda make the gaps
kinda come closer together

577
00:32:13,729 --> 00:32:17,639
DNA testing thing just generically with
what we size

578
00:32:17,639 --> 00:32:22,299
10 things we did see was some extremely
poor never segmentation and

579
00:32:22,299 --> 00:32:25,759
you know obviously you can always throw
money at a problem to fix it the

580
00:32:25,759 --> 00:32:29,229
sometimes you can start to do other
things that don't cost a lot like

581
00:32:29,229 --> 00:32:33,599
you are restricting physical access to
use a particular machine the controls

582
00:32:33,599 --> 00:32:35,178
your jail cell doors

583
00:32:35,179 --> 00:32:39,200
is probably a lot cheaper then hiring
someone in

584
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:43,129
to you know to redesign the entire
network and segmented properly implied

585
00:32:43,129 --> 00:32:44,570
by new routing gear

586
00:32:44,570 --> 00:32:48,158
who knows you know but there's there are
his

587
00:32:48,159 --> 00:32:51,809
the typical air defenses the answer and
you just implement

588
00:32:51,809 --> 00:32:55,269
as much as you can when you have the
opportunity yet sometimes it's actually

589
00:32:55,269 --> 00:32:55,700
it's

590
00:32:55,700 --> 00:32:58,799
is the easy stuff it's the physical
security stuff that that's actually the

591
00:32:58,799 --> 00:33:00,710
simplest I mean there's a story

592
00:33:00,710 --> 00:33:04,869
two years ago now about a kid and I
don't remember the exact details on it

593
00:33:04,869 --> 00:33:06,379
that you have to google it but

594
00:33:06,379 --> 00:33:10,269
some kid i think is in Denmark who
crashed a light rail train

595
00:33:10,269 --> 00:33:13,330
you get his turn crash the light rail
train in his

596
00:33:13,330 --> 00:33:17,820
in his City on by reprogramming his VCR
remote

597
00:33:17,820 --> 00:33:21,859
out and outside his house the light rail
train had and inner and infrared

598
00:33:21,859 --> 00:33:22,629
interface

599
00:33:22,629 --> 00:33:26,690
for signaling and I mean literally this
kids like oh look I completed my VCR

600
00:33:26,690 --> 00:33:29,779
remote I can do stuff and eventually
figured out how to change the switch

601
00:33:29,779 --> 00:33:31,899
with his VCR his TV remote

602
00:33:31,899 --> 00:33:35,179
and crash the train it was bizarre but

603
00:33:35,179 --> 00:33:38,489
to that point I mean I I was on a TRB
panel

604
00:33:38,489 --> 00:33:41,950
about six months ago into to the point
about the research finally getting out

605
00:33:41,950 --> 00:33:42,509
there

606
00:33:42,509 --> 00:33:45,749
people are starting actually understand
that this is a problem you know when

607
00:33:45,749 --> 00:33:48,029
kids are crashing trains with television
around like

608
00:33:48,029 --> 00:33:51,519
0 or we can open all the doors in the
prisoner or what whatever like

609
00:33:51,519 --> 00:33:55,450
ol may be really should check my email
and and I'm starting to get some

610
00:33:55,450 --> 00:33:58,549
some play and we can actually start to
get some leverage in

611
00:33:58,549 --> 00:34:03,379
and hopefully make some changes yeah
absolutely

612
00:34:03,379 --> 00:34:06,599
and give me the commentary and daily
about that animal I will open it up to

613
00:34:06,599 --> 00:34:08,440
questions

614
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:12,080
yeah I do have one last thing on it's
probably the one thing them

615
00:34:12,080 --> 00:34:15,500
probably the most disappointing about
when it comes to like the border daily

616
00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:16,290
disclosures

617
00:34:16,290 --> 00:34:20,580
stuff that we did and you know we we did
push everything to DHS and the vendors

618
00:34:20,580 --> 00:34:21,690
are notified but

619
00:34:21,690 --> 00:34:26,389
does it always seem like the people that
really need to fix this kinda stuff

620
00:34:26,389 --> 00:34:30,500
AK the implementer building that had to
stop in their buildings

621
00:34:30,500 --> 00:34:34,219
in order to PLT the guys who actually
implement our have a PLT running

622
00:34:34,219 --> 00:34:35,219
somewhere

623
00:34:35,219 --> 00:34:39,200
they were like the last to know right so
on the government new

624
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:43,169
you know the vendors definitely near and
then it became this argument ass like

625
00:34:43,168 --> 00:34:46,830
when and how you know that your like
tell the public

626
00:34:46,830 --> 00:34:49,879
and it's like well honestly those guys
are probably the first to know

627
00:34:49,879 --> 00:34:52,719
right because they're the ones that are
running the standard or interact

628
00:34:52,719 --> 00:34:54,149
accepting all this pressure

629
00:34:54,149 --> 00:34:57,180
I'm but it always seems like it's there
the last 10

630
00:34:57,180 --> 00:35:01,430
you know and I hope like in the near
future we can solve that problem where

631
00:35:01,430 --> 00:35:04,618
the people that actually really need to
know this stuff for personnel tractor

632
00:35:04,619 --> 00:35:06,230
they can take the right steps to

633
00:35:06,230 --> 00:35:09,380
protect themselves or protect whatever
is that they're they're running

634
00:35:09,380 --> 00:35:12,650
you know

635
00:35:12,650 --> 00:35:16,200
and the cable I will take some questions
and if you can hear terry Billy Wilder

636
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:17,259
keep them for you

637
00:35:17,259 --> 00:35:20,910
actually will repeat them make sure
everyone does hear them some years ago I

638
00:35:20,910 --> 00:35:24,390
didn't says MANOVA badge access control
system

639
00:35:24,390 --> 00:35:28,618
and I discovered that it was listening
on 22 ports

640
00:35:28,619 --> 00:35:34,230
its its root password was over 00 T
documented in the manual

641
00:35:34,230 --> 00:35:37,690
the firm advised that the dialup modem

642
00:35:37,690 --> 00:35:42,259
that was attached to the computer always
be on for better maintainability of the

643
00:35:42,259 --> 00:35:43,219
system

644
00:35:43,219 --> 00:35:46,549
in this was in use in use at all the
British airports

645
00:35:46,549 --> 00:35:50,420
at prisons are consulates at the library
of congress

646
00:35:50,420 --> 00:35:54,170
at the US House of Representatives
Senate I'm

647
00:35:54,170 --> 00:35:58,569
and I started calling inspector
general's inspectors general various

648
00:35:58,569 --> 00:35:59,450
agencies in

649
00:35:59,450 --> 00:36:03,098
got them to recognize the problem but
the vendor of course was in

650
00:36:03,099 --> 00:36:06,719
great denial was used that prison's and
of course you could open all the prison

651
00:36:06,719 --> 00:36:07,259
doors

652
00:36:07,259 --> 00:36:10,540
using this thing elevate your badge you
could

653
00:36:10,540 --> 00:36:15,259
create events that we're not locked
because the misplaced right 0

654
00:36:15,259 --> 00:36:18,900
the system was open source not not for
any

655
00:36:18,900 --> 00:36:22,480
political technical reason but just
because they wanted to if def

656
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:26,380
in features since the system so there
was you know if death

657
00:36:26,380 --> 00:36:30,890
embassy if death Heathrow if Jeff names
our customers and their code

658
00:36:30,890 --> 00:36:34,598
so we can actually find bugs in a in the
system

659
00:36:34,599 --> 00:36:38,609
including misplaced right curly brackets
which prevented certain events from

660
00:36:38,609 --> 00:36:39,869
being logged

661
00:36:39,869 --> 00:36:43,920
I'm you can create still badges it was
really just terrible

662
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:48,060
ended up in the New York Times but the
vendor was in complete denial

663
00:36:48,060 --> 00:36:52,810
I that was a great story but I don't
think use our surprise any the faces

664
00:36:52,810 --> 00:36:53,270
appear

665
00:36:53,270 --> 00:36:56,529
yeah I said I realize that museum

666
00:36:56,529 --> 00:37:00,380
it is amusing and that is a a tough
thing is when your security researcher

667
00:37:00,380 --> 00:37:01,830
for any view other her doing his work

668
00:37:01,830 --> 00:37:07,598
how do you do who you tell under some
security researchers that use ICS sir

669
00:37:07,599 --> 00:37:11,239
then there's some security researchers
in this that independent security

670
00:37:11,239 --> 00:37:13,359
researchers we've met him said they've
said well

671
00:37:13,359 --> 00:37:17,119
wanna were kinda made them annoyed
summer with ICS certain is that there

672
00:37:17,119 --> 00:37:18,170
was something that was

673
00:37:18,170 --> 00:37:21,430
a bug but they called it a future and it
was

674
00:37:21,430 --> 00:37:24,419
something that they're like they're not
gonna release that is a warning no I

675
00:37:24,420 --> 00:37:27,890
forgot to mention the back door that was
in every implementation

676
00:37:27,890 --> 00:37:30,960
if you typed the right magic function at
the date

677
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:34,089
into the any other attach terminals it
would

678
00:37:34,089 --> 00:37:38,710
Openreach shell for you and this was
undocumented but we found in the source

679
00:37:38,710 --> 00:37:39,960
code

680
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:43,980
who is amazing I S

681
00:37:43,980 --> 00:37:47,609
out great great show as lovely I am

682
00:37:47,609 --> 00:37:51,630
were all akers we appreciate all the
stuff you give us for information but

683
00:37:51,630 --> 00:37:53,150
when you present to

684
00:37:53,150 --> 00:37:56,480
organizations and groups do they ever
try to kinda

685
00:37:56,480 --> 00:38:01,940
who says a pure terror sort their
TribLocal issue like that

686
00:38:01,940 --> 00:38:05,020
and has happened tease security
researchers yes

687
00:38:05,020 --> 00:38:08,270
and especially when you're when that
when the assets are

688
00:38:08,270 --> 00:38:11,630
over the I wanna was a target because
that would make a see my tears but

689
00:38:11,630 --> 00:38:15,560
when the asset is a you know transit in
New Yorker DC

690
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:19,380
or when we were talking about some of
the country's greatest liabilities which

691
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:19,810
are

692
00:38:19,810 --> 00:38:23,279
in a maximum-security prisons it's kinda
hard I'm

693
00:38:23,279 --> 00:38:27,369
it was challenging the day took it took
some a a lot of preparation

694
00:38:27,369 --> 00:38:30,580
and we wanted to tell them because
they're really the only ones who can

695
00:38:30,580 --> 00:38:31,210
somewhat

696
00:38:31,210 --> 00:38:34,390
fix there you know get aware that this
problem

697
00:38:34,390 --> 00:38:37,430
and government try to fix this and get
the vendors to patch

698
00:38:37,430 --> 00:38:40,819
I think that we were lucky in our
experience

699
00:38:40,819 --> 00:38:44,259
you know his we we approach them
directly you know we said we want to

700
00:38:44,259 --> 00:38:45,299
talk about this boldly

701
00:38:45,299 --> 00:38:48,630
by you guys make the call and they were
pretty

702
00:38:48,630 --> 00:38:52,839
you know pretty good with does nobody
tried to pass out bagay knows my thank

703
00:38:52,839 --> 00:38:54,339
you for telling us we're glad

704
00:38:54,339 --> 00:38:58,210
I would appreciate if you didn't release
it publicly I fine

705
00:38:58,210 --> 00:39:01,500
but day we had a pleasant experience

706
00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:05,310
I yeah I think that's actually that's
part of that is just the timing on what

707
00:39:05,310 --> 00:39:06,339
you guys have done

708
00:39:06,339 --> 00:39:11,640
you know like I said in 2004 2005 2006
people weren't nearly as

709
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:14,879
aware up the kinda problems you guys
have been bringing up and and

710
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:17,589
they haven't heard have you know don't
researching your research and things

711
00:39:17,589 --> 00:39:18,400
like that

712
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:21,940
you guys are have the benefit have
everybody's kinda coming out the same

713
00:39:21,940 --> 00:39:23,000
time

714
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:26,859
you know several years ago absolutely it
was like wire why are you doing this

715
00:39:26,859 --> 00:39:30,020
while looking at this what's your
problem would you trying to

716
00:39:30,020 --> 00:39:30,719
trouble-maker

717
00:39:30,719 --> 00:39:34,060
yeah no know your stuff broken

718
00:39:34,060 --> 00:39:37,099
make fix it but but yeah I think I think
that that

719
00:39:37,099 --> 00:39:40,520
there are industry groups like I see a
certain stuff like that makes it easier

720
00:39:40,520 --> 00:39:43,180
to have those conversations in the same
way

721
00:39:43,180 --> 00:39:47,368
do you think you've got a friend Adrian
you as a irrational and organizations

722
00:39:47,369 --> 00:39:48,640
that really does

723
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:53,920
a.m. don't go pink your rights yessir
agree we had organizations though

724
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:58,369
you gotta realize this of course made
around the world graders not just

725
00:39:58,369 --> 00:40:01,580
american companies unit I means im
interview

726
00:40:01,580 --> 00:40:05,460
company international but they're big
enough that they can have a process

727
00:40:05,460 --> 00:40:07,099
began over

728
00:40:07,099 --> 00:40:10,239
we actually had some firms over in my
Israel

729
00:40:10,239 --> 00:40:13,469
they were nice yessir want to talk to
them

730
00:40:13,469 --> 00:40:17,029
new date they basically gave them who
are you

731
00:40:17,029 --> 00:40:21,069
and we're gonna do all background check
to make sure your legit

732
00:40:21,069 --> 00:40:24,119
or even talk who alright because

733
00:40:24,119 --> 00:40:28,170
their alter paranoid about no these
hackers bringing

734
00:40:28,170 --> 00:40:32,020
about their bright Anna those are the
sort of things that we didn't want to

735
00:40:32,020 --> 00:40:33,069
have to deal with

736
00:40:33,069 --> 00:40:36,270
but you have to realize that this
software is

737
00:40:36,270 --> 00:40:39,900
it crosses a lot of borders air there
when you talk about being

738
00:40:39,900 --> 00:40:45,180
but and summer stopper any backers out
there like will get them with partners

739
00:40:45,180 --> 00:40:48,859
like that

740
00:40:48,859 --> 00:40:52,810
okay thank you thank you thanks

741
00:40:52,810 --> 00:40:56,680
hey there it and so with what are the
things that

742
00:40:56,680 --> 00:41:00,078
I was thinking why you giving the speech
is just the general age

743
00:41:00,079 --> 00:41:04,440
love this equipment is is not really
taking into consideration in the

744
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:05,859
information that year

745
00:41:05,859 --> 00:41:09,279
betraying and simply because you know

746
00:41:09,279 --> 00:41:12,910
a lot of these factory PLC's were
designed

747
00:41:12,910 --> 00:41:17,078
before you know Ethernet interfaces were
even on the equipment

748
00:41:17,079 --> 00:41:21,799
so you've not got a you know
second-generation engineers

749
00:41:21,799 --> 00:41:26,410
attaching a Ethan and interfaces to
analog interface is right

750
00:41:26,410 --> 00:41:29,540
so Unisa two things to consider

751
00:41:29,540 --> 00:41:32,849
you know while we're busy you're
slamming Siemens in these guys for not

752
00:41:32,849 --> 00:41:34,029
considering the stuff

753
00:41:34,029 --> 00:41:37,469
is that yet they they've been designed
the the device

754
00:41:37,469 --> 00:41:40,799
initially to be on internet on anything
face

755
00:41:40,799 --> 00:41:45,020
it's not just being connected to one via
some third party in some cases

756
00:41:45,020 --> 00:41:48,839
and you know and secondly you know a lot
of the times these devices

757
00:41:48,839 --> 00:41:52,839
in a we you wouldn't find any other
manufacturer the marks of or Apple

758
00:41:52,839 --> 00:41:54,299
support devices that are

759
00:41:54,299 --> 00:41:57,619
gardeners on the years old you know yeah
I know that

760
00:41:57,619 --> 00:42:00,670
that absolutely is is true in certain
cases

761
00:42:00,670 --> 00:42:03,819
I am and that was one of the things that
we found out

762
00:42:03,819 --> 00:42:07,279
as well so some home like cocaine

763
00:42:07,279 --> 00:42:10,739
in ICS we found that very often

764
00:42:10,739 --> 00:42:14,250
availability was a greatest priority and
so sometimes when

765
00:42:14,250 --> 00:42:17,279
the patches cycle could be a place six
years so

766
00:42:17,279 --> 00:42:21,359
you are looking you know I handled by
snatt is correct

767
00:42:21,359 --> 00:42:25,359
but it doesn't make it any less of a
problem is this so widely deployed in so

768
00:42:25,359 --> 00:42:27,520
that there's gotta be stuff

769
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:30,890
in between you know the implementation
I'll

770
00:42:30,890 --> 00:42:34,009
the next gen and what we have now to
make it

771
00:42:34,009 --> 00:42:37,790
better and safer as yeah I think to your
point

772
00:42:37,790 --> 00:42:41,799
yarn about the the physical segmentation
those networks is probably far more

773
00:42:41,799 --> 00:42:42,810
important than

774
00:42:42,810 --> 00:42:46,310
most is a topics now that was one of the
things did

775
00:42:46,310 --> 00:42:50,219
we really like the whole way long we're
going through like okay this is the

776
00:42:50,219 --> 00:42:53,739
immune idea by there's no way it's gonna
work out

777
00:42:53,739 --> 00:42:57,520
we like it's going to be a rig after its
gonna be this game that we got in there

778
00:42:57,520 --> 00:42:58,160
in

779
00:42:58,160 --> 00:43:01,319
rightly sign some Ailsa thought

780
00:43:01,319 --> 00:43:04,630
when he useful in a while

781
00:43:04,630 --> 00:43:08,160
betraying your statistics was the

782
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:11,399
I guess that the character other
statistics because

783
00:43:11,400 --> 00:43:14,400
you could take any level of code and

784
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:18,579
you know well thousands of potential
security problems

785
00:43:18,579 --> 00:43:21,890
but you know I you know when you're
reporting statistics like you know

786
00:43:21,890 --> 00:43:25,160
100000 bugs are you talking about on

787
00:43:25,160 --> 00:43:29,469
a like external vendor firmware buns or
you talking about

788
00:43:29,469 --> 00:43:32,779
bugs that are exposed due to the
implementation of

789
00:43:32,779 --> 00:43:35,810
love the way that the device is being
used

790
00:43:35,810 --> 00:43:39,380
is that those as programming languages
are you know that its

791
00:43:39,380 --> 00:43:43,349
it's up to every engineer and and and
the engineering this factory

792
00:43:43,349 --> 00:43:47,029
is far more concerned about whether the
cause gonna fall off the conveyor belt

793
00:43:47,029 --> 00:43:47,549
then

794
00:43:47,549 --> 00:43:53,380
with some connection getting to the bus

795
00:43:53,380 --> 00:43:56,930
yeah I heard the question I actually
want to talk about the first point that

796
00:43:56,930 --> 00:43:57,950
you brought up

797
00:43:57,950 --> 00:44:01,630
where you say you know some other stuff
was designed in it in an age before

798
00:44:01,630 --> 00:44:04,850
they realize they were spying to be
connected to the Internet basing the

799
00:44:04,850 --> 00:44:06,359
entire world right like a

800
00:44:06,359 --> 00:44:09,989
we understand that no but at the same
time

801
00:44:09,989 --> 00:44:13,870
you can't let the vendors of the right
so if you give them the opportunity to

802
00:44:13,870 --> 00:44:15,138
say hey you know what

803
00:44:15,139 --> 00:44:18,409
I'm we never designed to do that I'm
sorry like they'll

804
00:44:18,409 --> 00:44:22,069
builders take that standing just report
right armor and

805
00:44:22,069 --> 00:44:25,170
you can't let them do that right the
world has changed world to change around

806
00:44:25,170 --> 00:44:26,389
their software

807
00:44:26,389 --> 00:44:29,690
and your hardware and you they have to
adapt right

808
00:44:29,690 --> 00:44:33,589
and if you don't force them to add up a
wall or just keep doing the same things

809
00:44:33,589 --> 00:44:34,549
that they're doing

810
00:44:34,549 --> 00:44:37,730
and we've seen that right like something
your software that surlis

811
00:44:37,730 --> 00:44:41,830
by a lot other better i'm talking like
within the last couple years

812
00:44:41,830 --> 00:44:45,489
it shares the same design principle the
same code laws

813
00:44:45,489 --> 00:44:49,330
the same error that they have near the
same block that they've had like twenty

814
00:44:49,330 --> 00:44:49,759
years ago

815
00:44:49,759 --> 00:44:53,449
right and that's not acceptable you know
they have to adapt to the world

816
00:44:53,449 --> 00:44:56,859
I'm they can just pretend like they're
sheltered and like no one ever gonna

817
00:44:56,859 --> 00:44:59,909
figure this stuff out as a its you know
obscure

818
00:44:59,909 --> 00:45:04,589
right so I'm it separate you a street i
think im retarded understand that

819
00:45:04,589 --> 00:45:07,940
some other stuff probably isn't as
robust at Purcell person

820
00:45:07,940 --> 00:45:11,509
makes it out to be right and at the same
time the vendors

821
00:45:11,509 --> 00:45:15,230
need to get with the real world right
her room when they look outside and see

822
00:45:15,230 --> 00:45:17,290
everything is connected to the Internet
and

823
00:45:17,290 --> 00:45:20,679
people were connected directly to the
internet and such and understand that

824
00:45:20,679 --> 00:45:21,889
their environment

825
00:45:21,889 --> 00:45:24,810
and they need to change their path
accordingly you know and I hope that

826
00:45:24,810 --> 00:45:26,049
that's being done

827
00:45:26,049 --> 00:45:29,389
so but as for the bug that went down

828
00:45:29,389 --> 00:45:32,770
farmers about that we reported they're
not configuration issues

829
00:45:32,770 --> 00:45:36,190
right like we don't want to bring the
customer years there merge the back that

830
00:45:36,190 --> 00:45:38,609
we reported their strengths of her body

831
00:45:38,609 --> 00:45:42,179
right there bud where their vendor needs
to go back

832
00:45:42,179 --> 00:45:45,940
and Murray change a couple and the code
to fix the issue

833
00:45:45,940 --> 00:45:51,310
and and thats I would say probably like
95 99 percent about that were reported

834
00:45:51,310 --> 00:45:54,319
sir so much yeah and I think to your
other point

835
00:45:54,319 --> 00:45:58,130
the all the software we looked at was
the software

836
00:45:58,130 --> 00:46:01,239
you most here with no base on

837
00:46:01,239 --> 00:46:05,330
we weren't looking at physical hardware
no physical hardware as

838
00:46:05,330 --> 00:46:09,029
the same to order issued bill and
research shows that what they're like

839
00:46:09,029 --> 00:46:10,540
other guys they're doing

840
00:46:10,540 --> 00:46:13,900
great research in that area are related

841
00:46:13,900 --> 00:46:18,130
a.m. the issues across the board

842
00:46:18,130 --> 00:46:21,370
so software and hardware or

843
00:46:21,370 --> 00:46:26,330
firmware know it's a so the I was under
the impression that the the level but

844
00:46:26,330 --> 00:46:27,609
you're talking about were

845
00:46:27,609 --> 00:46:33,230
all exposed via the PLC hardware itself

846
00:46:33,230 --> 00:46:36,540
no is are all a Hemi

847
00:46:36,540 --> 00:46:39,799
or other pieces software

848
00:46:39,799 --> 00:46:43,690
are support system I'll yes Oteri in
Billy

849
00:46:43,690 --> 00:46:48,799
the primarily to teach my systems I'll
we looked at the PLC in the PLC software

850
00:46:48,799 --> 00:46:50,949
directly

851
00:46:50,949 --> 00:46:55,480
there the large for them this from the
gym by I think my everything about be

852
00:46:55,480 --> 00:46:57,389
systems is that they are so complex

853
00:46:57,389 --> 00:47:00,569
and and I think one of the things we
need to keep you know just as an aside

854
00:47:00,569 --> 00:47:04,139
keep the pressure on the vendors for is
that wouldn't be cool factor

855
00:47:04,139 --> 00:47:08,359
you know you design this thing in 1978
to do one function and then somebody

856
00:47:08,359 --> 00:47:09,290
comes along

857
00:47:09,290 --> 00:47:12,549
this year thanks only because we put it
on the internet we did

858
00:47:12,549 --> 00:47:15,779
connected to the Internet I acted to
hear that spectrum and was

859
00:47:15,779 --> 00:47:20,069
he was manager from his iPad right yeah
but was denied that happen is that

860
00:47:20,069 --> 00:47:24,589
yeah NF if we can keep the pressure on
the vendors to not fall prey to that I

861
00:47:24,589 --> 00:47:26,259
think that would be a good thing for all
of us

862
00:47:26,259 --> 00:47:30,609
I i just think we should published the
statistics in a more

863
00:47:30,609 --> 00:47:35,089
accurate yes I'll be addressed the right
areas love the problem

864
00:47:35,089 --> 00:47:38,639
but thank you as Stephanie with paying
attention to it although

865
00:47:38,639 --> 00:47:42,589
at I think we got two minutes left so
one more question

866
00:47:42,589 --> 00:47:45,920
against ties in a bid to his arm how
much

867
00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:49,170
successive you had in getting the
vendors to think security first

868
00:47:49,170 --> 00:47:53,600
I did a master's thesis in SCADA back in
2004

869
00:47:53,600 --> 00:47:56,969
and there is just basically a very brief
overview of the

870
00:47:56,969 --> 00:48:01,420
security picture in the environment and
I we hearing about things like

871
00:48:01,420 --> 00:48:06,359
the controlling to no remote power
plants I would be over an unencrypted

872
00:48:06,359 --> 00:48:10,889
radio link not not even like open wifi
just long distance radio with known

873
00:48:10,889 --> 00:48:12,339
Chris Shino

874
00:48:12,339 --> 00:48:15,719
authentication know anything at all show
you don't even need to find

875
00:48:15,719 --> 00:48:19,270
just needed turn on the radio skin

876
00:48:19,270 --> 00:48:22,480
yeah that's still the case in other
places yeah

877
00:48:22,480 --> 00:48:26,839
just fine glaring designs nobody's even
thought about security and

878
00:48:26,839 --> 00:48:30,159
yeah that's why we would we did as wave
with our group we brought awareness to

879
00:48:30,159 --> 00:48:32,940
directly to the government agencies that
we thought would be the ones

880
00:48:32,940 --> 00:48:36,029
would be most interested in trying to
make some changes so

881
00:48:36,029 --> 00:48:39,420
we political more question real quick if
you if you have them freely

882
00:48:39,420 --> 00:48:42,440
you know I'd actually like to add
something to that like how do you bring

883
00:48:42,440 --> 00:48:45,580
you know someone is awareness I think
you know maybe it will

884
00:48:45,580 --> 00:48:49,770
above the first after to let these
vendors know that security is not magic

885
00:48:49,770 --> 00:48:53,850
right like there's definitely some
science behind it and fixing bugs is

886
00:48:53,850 --> 00:48:54,790
literally a matter

887
00:48:54,790 --> 00:48:58,179
adding a couple and the Karrimor cases
right it

888
00:48:58,179 --> 00:49:01,850
sometimes it's not very complicated to
pick certain issues arm design issues

889
00:49:01,850 --> 00:49:02,520
you have course

890
00:49:02,520 --> 00:49:05,929
it requires a lot more but promoters
that that we encounter

891
00:49:05,929 --> 00:49:08,989
it doesn't take very much for them to
pick you

892
00:49:08,989 --> 00:49:12,420
breedlove we're gonna more question or a
a term be quick

893
00:49:12,420 --> 00:49:16,250
am I work in a similar industry none
exactly the same

894
00:49:16,250 --> 00:49:21,219
but a it seems like you're very
antagonistic towards the people you've

895
00:49:21,219 --> 00:49:22,400
been dealing with

896
00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:25,880
not everybody but you mean sometimes
those two those relationships may

897
00:49:25,880 --> 00:49:26,699
develop that way

898
00:49:26,699 --> 00:49:30,400
and a.m.

899
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:34,049
it's a like fixing two lines code is
really easy

900
00:49:34,049 --> 00:49:37,310
but that's not the expensive part its
testing

901
00:49:37,310 --> 00:49:40,650
and delivering an you know they don't
work for you they work for their

902
00:49:40,650 --> 00:49:41,359
customers

903
00:49:41,359 --> 00:49:44,830
so I mean you mentioned in your talk it
seems like the the

904
00:49:44,830 --> 00:49:48,409
culture at the people who are
implementing the systems using them

905
00:49:48,409 --> 00:49:53,420
might be a very important kinda vector
to get in

906
00:49:53,420 --> 00:49:58,239
because you know the they're not gonna
spend money just because someone calls

907
00:49:58,239 --> 00:50:00,049
months is your problem

908
00:50:00,049 --> 00:50:03,540
so I just wanted to kinda bring that
aspect and

909
00:50:03,540 --> 00:50:07,380
in there yeah I think you're absolutely
right

910
00:50:07,380 --> 00:50:11,500
in the thats were things that it is all
your help we're very

911
00:50:11,500 --> 00:50:14,889
return cuz customers don't know where
you know

912
00:50:14,889 --> 00:50:18,370
at their disposal they don't know task

913
00:50:18,370 --> 00:50:21,388
they are we born herbal right

914
00:50:21,389 --> 00:50:25,480
and so I think the culture aspect does
need to change but I think

915
00:50:25,480 --> 00:50:30,310
that's where the awareness helped very
it's difficult to change it

916
00:50:30,310 --> 00:50:34,469
people don't even no because the
company's not gonna tell them

917
00:50:34,469 --> 00:50:38,150
okay thank you thank you very much her
brother time baghdad

918
00:50:38,150 --> 00:50:38,690
thanks very much how
