Scott and producers

23
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:18,800
from selling by

24
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:22,920
as jason said we're going to be talking
about this project ivars called 0 they

25
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:24,160
aren't we started

26
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:26,939
just about a year ago

27
00:01:26,939 --> 00:01:30,780
and this this is the talk and that we're
doing for you guys here and herb called

28
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:33,009
dead in a pool of blood in millions of
dollars

29
00:01:33,009 --> 00:01:36,159
manner and so let's

30
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:40,280
let's just talk for Easter about a
little about who we are

31
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:44,200
am interns have this project so

32
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:48,469
by at its heart what we are is

33
00:01:48,469 --> 00:01:53,319
pirate software group for for Internet
art and for digital art so we've got bad

34
00:01:53,319 --> 00:01:54,390
you know there are

35
00:01:54,390 --> 00:01:59,399
there are groups that pirate everything
from movies to TV shows to music to

36
00:01:59,399 --> 00:02:00,500
software

37
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:05,439
from internet art is just another typeof
software another type of media that's

38
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:06,250
distributed

39
00:02:06,250 --> 00:02:10,038
over over the web and over

40
00:02:10,039 --> 00:02:13,310
over the network's so from why isn't
anyone

41
00:02:13,310 --> 00:02:17,170
taking this in making sure that it's
spread and

42
00:02:17,170 --> 00:02:20,280
is intuitive subject to

43
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:23,480
and abuse these false

44
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:26,910
am structures have scarcity that

45
00:02:26,910 --> 00:02:30,780
are sometimes imposed on digital works
and digital media

46
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:34,620
by outside forces in most cases were
talking about

47
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:38,160
for instance the MPAA in in the a.m

48
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:41,630
when we're talking about movie piracy or
from

49
00:02:41,630 --> 00:02:44,959
or software companies themselves
enforcing their copyright

50
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:48,019
one software aspire to in this case and

51
00:02:48,019 --> 00:02:52,760
it sometimes am galleries that are
trying to you

52
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:56,160
some to take works offline for

53
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:59,540
are collectors after they're sold or ads

54
00:02:59,540 --> 00:03:03,340
arts organizations that are trying and
two your approach

55
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:06,560
I'm the monetization met-art and a
certain way

56
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:11,670
and so we thought this was an an
interesting project to explore this idea

57
00:03:11,670 --> 00:03:15,530
yeah so mom again I will talk more about

58
00:03:15,530 --> 00:03:19,110
Anna your chin this term in a moment but
we're known is your day are

59
00:03:19,110 --> 00:03:24,400
and I'm our motto is pretty simple and
it's that we put in our back on the net

60
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:28,420
and on again deterred look at this term
0 yards

61
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:32,280
and think about am where this comes from
have to look at I'm kind in history at

62
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:32,920
the scene

63
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:36,510
and also on getting to know exactly what
his neck are

64
00:03:36,510 --> 00:03:39,989
so I'm site we can really just simply
talk about where's

65
00:03:39,990 --> 00:03:43,860
and wear something and maybe everyone
hears from her with and on

66
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:47,160
it you know refers as a germ I said to
works there are

67
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:50,180
copyrighted and distributed without fees
or royalties

68
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:55,260
and out where's group arm that exist
kinda globally referred to as the where

69
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:56,739
seen were as

70
00:03:56,740 --> 00:04:01,960
on you know just largely the scene and
i'd this term can be use a number ways

71
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:05,480
are one way you can use from where's is
to say something like I downloaded 10

72
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:07,270
gigabytes have where's yesterday

73
00:04:07,270 --> 00:04:10,630
this is a very common type thinking
about it has that

74
00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:14,100
and use that as AI noun but arm

75
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:17,680
less of them because be used as you know
the new windows was where's

76
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:21,870
a month before Microsoft officially
released it this is a term that I V

77
00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:23,640
don't use now you know how to use it

78
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:27,620
and I you can go forth and I do so and I
had a long

79
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:31,520
and adaware scene has a long long
history and I'm he grew up in the 80's

80
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:33,909
news bulletin boards and then moved onto
the internet

81
00:04:33,910 --> 00:04:37,120
and I chances are you've probably been
familiar where's for

82
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:41,210
a long time and I we can trace the
origins at the scene

83
00:04:41,210 --> 00:04:44,530
armory leave on your back to that time

84
00:04:44,530 --> 00:04:50,490
yeah and so and sue what would group
started doing is when the

85
00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:53,520
cracked a PC software and they
distributed

86
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:56,539
they would start I'm tagging the
software with these

87
00:04:56,540 --> 00:05:01,430
interest screens am and so here you see
an example

88
00:05:01,430 --> 00:05:05,200
via an Activision product that weighs
pirated

89
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:09,320
and this is that the group that it
started giving their greets and is

90
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:10,790
letting you know that your

91
00:05:10,790 --> 00:05:14,380
you're able to to you I'm run the
software beakers

92
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:17,590
and they're the ones that were able to
crack it am

93
00:05:17,590 --> 00:05:22,060
and now when we talk about where is the
terms your day and your day are

94
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:26,310
and is is sort of a reference to the
time

95
00:05:26,310 --> 00:05:31,270
and in which it takes I'm from the
release date you they're releasing the

96
00:05:31,270 --> 00:05:32,650
pirated version so

97
00:05:32,650 --> 00:05:36,790
if you're able to you I'm to get your
hands on a copy

98
00:05:36,790 --> 00:05:40,470
love piece of software or in our case
we're talking about

99
00:05:40,470 --> 00:05:45,050
works have avnet ardor digital art and
release it within the same

100
00:05:45,050 --> 00:05:49,220
within the same day or before the actual
official release date as bad

101
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:53,460
about work then I your you're talking
about as you're owed a release

102
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:58,320
from so yeah I guess you wanna pick up
from there in

103
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:02,310
and continue on with their yeah I am I
think gets and that that's pretty much

104
00:06:02,310 --> 00:06:03,080
where all

105
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:06,200
we could say about their day so for this
term if you're unfamiliar that when we

106
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:07,340
come up with their de Arte

107
00:06:07,340 --> 00:06:11,310
arm you know this was actually go that
we I'm have achieved i think im

108
00:06:11,310 --> 00:06:12,680
israeli's are tried

109
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:15,690
really hard including our first one
which is will talk about more

110
00:06:15,690 --> 00:06:18,770
is that yes 01 something releases we
feverishly

111
00:06:18,770 --> 00:06:21,919
hap to you on get together to really sit
within 24 hours

112
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:25,400
and on you know I'm primarily I mean

113
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:28,840
not historically I distribution center
so where's look something like this:

114
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:32,140
and down and here you can see that at

115
00:06:32,140 --> 00:06:35,770
there's tons the CDs and duplication us
software

116
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:39,880
I mean hardware do I get stuff out there
and I am

117
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:44,450
along with our along with a zero-day

118
00:06:44,450 --> 00:06:48,330
releases on what we saw here earlier
this activation screen that I am

119
00:06:48,330 --> 00:06:51,729
jamas talking about here there's some
things that this this kind of evolved

120
00:06:51,729 --> 00:06:53,919
trade for CC things are going to the
hallmark of

121
00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:57,460
later cracked roseanne intros easy
things like thanks so they're thanking

122
00:06:57,460 --> 00:06:58,030
people

123
00:06:58,030 --> 00:07:01,340
rate you also see arm people's names
mentioned

124
00:07:01,340 --> 00:07:05,290
arm which would come to be known as
greets and US had this idea that this

125
00:07:05,290 --> 00:07:06,150
that it's not just

126
00:07:06,150 --> 00:07:09,470
Activision bringing this to you it
actually Activision and the racketeers

127
00:07:09,470 --> 00:07:12,810
so it actually people that are coming
and creditors

128
00:07:12,810 --> 00:07:15,880
it's not just the people that are
bringing you there are creating

129
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:19,380
the media or the arc for the game but
it's our city but are cracking and there

130
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:21,180
have a part in bringing this to you

131
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:24,700
so a crack show arm you know is an intro

132
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:28,200
I'm introduction to a game like you'd
see their but on

133
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:32,659
at the same time a accompanies a crack
and this just shows who was responsible

134
00:07:32,659 --> 00:07:33,400
for it

135
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:36,979
and on who brought this to you may greet
your friends you might

136
00:07:36,979 --> 00:07:41,960
on fuck off to your enemies and it was
really made to impress people and let

137
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:43,830
people know who is responsible so good
to go

138
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:48,390
look at arm some crack shows one cracked
row here that would have existed

139
00:07:48,390 --> 00:07:51,760
on back and I think this is like the 80s
she's

140
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:56,090
these

141
00:07:56,090 --> 00:08:03,090
a

142
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:13,440
the

143
00:08:16,139 --> 00:08:19,590
the

144
00:08:19,590 --> 00:08:23,159
all right that is a comer 64 on and how
many have you

145
00:08:23,159 --> 00:08:27,129
mom recognize that from the opening
notes but um

146
00:08:27,129 --> 00:08:31,150
the so that the cracker still exist
today so it may be downloaded on pirated

147
00:08:31,150 --> 00:08:32,940
software 1.0 and seen

148
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:36,360
and execute well that you're probably
afraid to click on and died I was

149
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:37,459
accompanied with the

150
00:08:37,459 --> 00:08:40,550
aware that you downloaded and then we
open up your eyes snap are the software

151
00:08:40,549 --> 00:08:42,019
but here's the song

152
00:08:42,019 --> 00:08:45,079
it might be actually accompanying the
key generator they came with your

153
00:08:45,079 --> 00:08:45,750
software

154
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:49,200
and all this has a history I'm going
back to crack chose to happen you know

155
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,660
in a comment on a meager days

156
00:08:50,660 --> 00:08:54,709
and the scene really can spread out from
there and I'm again this is from the

157
00:08:54,709 --> 00:08:56,100
computer article on the scene

158
00:08:56,100 --> 00:09:00,060
so it started out really gotta as you
know the where seen but then people

159
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:03,890
diversified ready had people that made
music for keygens and for cracked rose

160
00:09:03,890 --> 00:09:07,630
you also had people that would make the
visual art and eventually

161
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:12,450
on you know people got more interested
in that side of things and you had this

162
00:09:12,450 --> 00:09:13,519
kind of splintering

163
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:17,959
on there from the where scene into
despair groups like their demo seen

164
00:09:17,959 --> 00:09:22,000
where people make these little intros in
them or more complex

165
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:26,180
arm works of art that stand alone so
it's no longer just a piece

166
00:09:26,180 --> 00:09:30,160
a cracked that is before Pisapia
download but something you download to

167
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:30,829
watch

168
00:09:30,829 --> 00:09:33,850
and to listen and it's a real time
demonstration love

169
00:09:33,850 --> 00:09:38,430
graphics and in music and really again

170
00:09:38,430 --> 00:09:41,680
a.m. to highlight the palace in the
coding ability I love the people

171
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:42,579
involved

172
00:09:42,579 --> 00:09:47,380
so on there has been this evolution we
show quick demo in this is from mom

173
00:09:47,380 --> 00:09:48,269
years later

174
00:09:48,269 --> 00:09:52,690
and it's much different than than the
common or that we just looked after

175
00:09:52,690 --> 00:09:59,690
well the

176
00:10:09,019 --> 00:10:11,290
the

177
00:10:11,290 --> 00:10:13,150
the

178
00:10:13,150 --> 00:10:19,560
the

179
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:25,320
the

180
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:32,320
well

181
00:10:33,810 --> 00:10:40,810
well the

182
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:51,040
the alright so

183
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:54,209
here you can see something that again is
much more

184
00:10:54,209 --> 00:10:58,209
evolved and then something is on the
Commodore 64 in this is because again

185
00:10:58,209 --> 00:10:59,420
people are just

186
00:10:59,420 --> 00:11:03,420
on who making a quick crack shower intro
to accompany

187
00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:06,459
the multiple releases and where's group
but this is something that is maybe

188
00:11:06,459 --> 00:11:10,170
the demos are months or even years at
work that people put together teams are

189
00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:10,680
people

190
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:13,769
and in order to release the Sabre love

191
00:11:13,769 --> 00:11:17,189
minute normally non-interactive but real
time

192
00:11:17,189 --> 00:11:20,629
demonstrations love on cutting ability
and artistic skill

193
00:11:20,629 --> 00:11:24,649
and I'm you know when you eat we think
about what we're doing most up

194
00:11:24,649 --> 00:11:28,629
the net or that we look at camp has its
roots are some people pay homage to this

195
00:11:28,629 --> 00:11:32,420
and I am this is kinda my background
when we talk about zero day

196
00:11:32,420 --> 00:11:35,680
and never gonna move on and talk really
about where the art side of things comes

197
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:36,209
in

198
00:11:36,209 --> 00:11:39,920
yeah and just an intern and a little bit
am

199
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:44,519
this is something that's and been
interesting to die and I'm because ive

200
00:11:44,519 --> 00:11:48,149
and the background entries and spoke a
little bit about the fact that

201
00:11:48,149 --> 00:11:51,660
from I'm in on the electronic musician
working with

202
00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:55,529
typically old video game hardware early
home computing systems

203
00:11:55,529 --> 00:11:59,920
and on is a visual artist doing the same
thing and

204
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:05,540
song want are what r artistic practice
is really about is almost it's a it's

205
00:12:05,540 --> 00:12:08,949
almost a deconstruction irv I'm real
time demo is because

206
00:12:08,949 --> 00:12:12,629
I'm greeting and greeting sir to the
soundtrack and when

207
00:12:12,629 --> 00:12:15,660
Don and I perform together he's is
creating

208
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:19,000
live visuals better from better being
played

209
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,889
and real-time usually from software that
is written himself for a min

210
00:12:22,889 --> 00:12:26,769
Nintendo Entertainment System more Sega
Genesis or

211
00:12:26,769 --> 00:12:31,399
other consoles and so this is something
that was interesting to us because its

212
00:12:31,399 --> 00:12:31,860
order

213
00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:36,059
wake I am packets or even continuing

214
00:12:36,059 --> 00:12:40,129
evolution in this this lineage this
thread that's run through

215
00:12:40,129 --> 00:12:44,279
their computer art scene and soon now
talking about men aren't which is

216
00:12:44,279 --> 00:12:45,750
something that sort of non

217
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:50,500
and its its related in some ways to you
and two demo seen culture but it is it

218
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:54,129
at definitely as: a separate thread its
own am

219
00:12:54,129 --> 00:12:57,740
this term is really and was was first
coined

220
00:12:57,740 --> 00:13:02,220
in there early to mid nineties for a
group of artists

221
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:07,059
they're working at the time but I N and
more generally and can refer to you

222
00:13:07,059 --> 00:13:10,809
from and basically anyone working with
the

223
00:13:10,809 --> 00:13:14,209
an the Internet as a medium for their
art

224
00:13:14,209 --> 00:13:17,410
so part that is am inherently tied

225
00:13:17,410 --> 00:13:21,139
and into the media more aware of the
medium and

226
00:13:21,139 --> 00:13:25,540
the advantages that the system dish
distribution gives you were at the sort

227
00:13:25,540 --> 00:13:27,579
of context and it provides for the works

228
00:13:27,579 --> 00:13:30,959
some and so we're going to just talk
about are

229
00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:35,290
a few examples of artists and better and
better working with the internet as a

230
00:13:35,290 --> 00:13:35,949
medium

231
00:13:35,949 --> 00:13:39,730
I'm starting from some a barrel earlier
generation and then moving into more

232
00:13:39,730 --> 00:13:40,819
contemporary ones

233
00:13:40,819 --> 00:13:45,589
right I'm so under how many if you've
seen this business and

234
00:13:45,589 --> 00:13:48,610
work from 1998 and I'm it's called
traitor

235
00:13:48,610 --> 00:13:52,459
and its arms to online today in
something by done by Martyn a beer

236
00:13:52,459 --> 00:13:56,120
and shredder and then you can go check
it out a potato land at work

237
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:59,550
shredder the idea here is that um you
know

238
00:13:59,550 --> 00:14:04,069
in it in the nineteen nineties of course
arm many of us probably I started me

239
00:14:04,069 --> 00:14:07,769
experimenting with web technologies and
it was especially important

240
00:14:07,769 --> 00:14:11,429
you know to understand that it's it the
web was open in a way that it

241
00:14:11,429 --> 00:14:14,860
is different and some software that you
have access to and that their source

242
00:14:14,860 --> 00:14:16,970
code behind everything that you see

243
00:14:16,970 --> 00:14:22,279
and shredder is um a kind anti browser
of sorts where you

244
00:14:22,279 --> 00:14:26,269
watch this window you put in a location
there is also number bookmarks and if

245
00:14:26,269 --> 00:14:29,360
you check out some the bookmarks listed
at my speech to the time that this was

246
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:29,990
released

247
00:14:29,990 --> 00:14:33,459
but I'm for instance I'm the screenshots
maynes it still works

248
00:14:33,459 --> 00:14:36,800
arm and you opening ya who and i'd the
world the out

249
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:39,889
the output is something like this so

250
00:14:39,889 --> 00:14:43,939
in it condemned literally just shreds
and you can see combinations are the

251
00:14:43,939 --> 00:14:47,490
images arm overlaid as well as some I
love the

252
00:14:47,490 --> 00:14:50,699
HTML the CSS and on the

253
00:14:50,699 --> 00:14:55,120
hyperlinks as well on this web page and
you can scroll and you kind of get the

254
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:55,889
feeling that

255
00:14:55,889 --> 00:14:59,540
your you know your you're not really
seen bit I'll

256
00:14:59,540 --> 00:15:03,559
the web page as intended but it's kinda
makes up the source code

257
00:15:03,559 --> 00:15:08,240
and the on the images and everything
that actually makes up the web sites

258
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:10,459
again this is released on back in 1998

259
00:15:10,459 --> 00:15:14,089
and B sample public am I talking about
as you know kind of more

260
00:15:14,089 --> 00:15:17,419
on classical or net art and there's a
nother

261
00:15:17,419 --> 00:15:20,689
duo named jodie

262
00:15:20,689 --> 00:15:24,880
and down this is an insulation love
there's and I'm this is

263
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:29,250
job untitled game which was one of 12
variations up the quake

264
00:15:29,250 --> 00:15:32,579
engine that they did I'm so if you
familiar um

265
00:15:32,579 --> 00:15:36,120
with the game Quake the modified it in
numerous ways and on this was

266
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:39,689
summer these recently shown on the New
York at the museum and moving image

267
00:15:39,689 --> 00:15:42,689
and I'm its kinda interesting on to see
these

268
00:15:42,689 --> 00:15:46,769
um you know this is one way could be
shown was also installed as this year's

269
00:15:46,769 --> 00:15:47,660
projections

270
00:15:47,660 --> 00:15:51,559
and I'm some the games have all the
graphics removes lawyers like the

271
00:15:51,559 --> 00:15:54,809
screaming monsters as you navigate to
the space blindly

272
00:15:54,809 --> 00:15:57,819
which you can see how you can guess how
well that would work great

273
00:15:57,819 --> 00:16:01,049
other ones have the debug information
streaming over top

274
00:16:01,049 --> 00:16:04,220
I love arm over top of all I love the
graphics

275
00:16:04,220 --> 00:16:07,269
so there's a pretty constructions I love
on that the game that day

276
00:16:07,269 --> 00:16:11,339
most people now but you experience in
different ways I'm another one of theirs

277
00:16:11,339 --> 00:16:14,689
which may or may not recognize here is
our Wolfenstein 3d

278
00:16:14,689 --> 00:16:18,540
dad I'm is is with all the graphics
completely removed

279
00:16:18,540 --> 00:16:22,610
so arm you know they're really kind of
%uh play with this idea

280
00:16:22,610 --> 00:16:26,399
love arm you know games and and but also
looking at you know

281
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:30,009
I'm kinda bring to light what is our
behind on what you're actually looking

282
00:16:30,009 --> 00:16:32,419
at

283
00:16:32,419 --> 00:16:36,769
and then and moving on to some other
more contemporary and earn an artist's

284
00:16:36,769 --> 00:16:41,240
and this is a an animated gif by the
artist Nicholas s Union

285
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:46,439
use air Canadian artist am and most of
his works are

286
00:16:46,439 --> 00:16:50,459
often presented in animated GIF format
and obviously this is

287
00:16:50,459 --> 00:16:53,839
and this is assertive from a choice

288
00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:58,970
presentation that is very tired today
onto the internet impaired to GIF format

289
00:16:58,970 --> 00:17:02,309
being such a popular way of displaying
moving images

290
00:17:02,309 --> 00:17:06,760
from back I even from that sorta early
internet is when

291
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:10,619
netscape first started adopting its
usage

292
00:17:10,620 --> 00:17:14,329
um and so many of his works are
concerned with

293
00:17:14,329 --> 00:17:17,530
landscape answer nerve architecture

294
00:17:17,530 --> 00:17:20,709
architectural forms so he's his

295
00:17:20,709 --> 00:17:24,809
this is from a series that is done call
Lance studies which is an arm

296
00:17:24,809 --> 00:17:27,879
be sorted mountainous

297
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:31,440
am pieces have to rein better
intersected

298
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:34,820
by these blocks of color and he's done

299
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:38,669
many of these some that that where the
blocks of color sorter

300
00:17:38,670 --> 00:17:42,450
mentor evoke a very minimalist am
structure and

301
00:17:42,450 --> 00:17:46,030
have housing units or I'm some type of
serve

302
00:17:46,030 --> 00:17:49,730
am cyberpunk sort of condominiums

303
00:17:49,730 --> 00:17:53,820
am and that and then moving on to you

304
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:59,020
from friends while gamma this is an eye
this is an artist who's based in

305
00:17:59,020 --> 00:18:02,360
am in Spain Anna and his

306
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:07,040
are again a lot of his work is done in
animated GIF format and he's

307
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:10,040
and he's very concerned with and the
body

308
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:14,790
um and the body not just as a sort of
physical

309
00:18:14,790 --> 00:18:18,159
am the physical bodies that we inhabit
but bodies

310
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:21,630
as at the avatars that we inhabit and

311
00:18:21,630 --> 00:18:25,230
in virtual space and how those to you
arm

312
00:18:25,230 --> 00:18:28,760
are at odds with one another and how
they collide with one another

313
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:31,790
come how their malleable and from

314
00:18:31,790 --> 00:18:37,020
and what this hors d'oeuvres with this

315
00:18:37,020 --> 00:18:41,060
makes us question about our our physical
bodies as we move move move into

316
00:18:41,060 --> 00:18:42,360
spending more and more time

317
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:45,390
in in virtual spaces am

318
00:18:45,390 --> 00:18:47,340
the next artist is

319
00:18:47,340 --> 00:18:50,399
Michael Manning he's also from again

320
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:55,210
working very often with animated GIF
format I'm answer your YouTube can

321
00:18:55,210 --> 00:18:56,120
probably

322
00:18:56,120 --> 00:19:00,790
pick up on the trend here in as far as
contemporary internet artist Sam

323
00:19:00,790 --> 00:19:04,530
begin freezes and then incredibly
popular format and

324
00:19:04,530 --> 00:19:08,850
Michael from is is based here in the
United States

325
00:19:08,850 --> 00:19:12,970
and he he's very interested in

326
00:19:12,970 --> 00:19:16,330
am certain elements of popular culture
fashion

327
00:19:16,330 --> 00:19:19,879
from corporate brands and things like
this so

328
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:23,710
we have another work we're gonna pop out
to show I'm called my

329
00:19:23,710 --> 00:19:26,920
my spirit is lost from Michael and this
is their

330
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:30,030
aware where browser-based work

331
00:19:30,030 --> 00:19:35,070
had to forgive me

332
00:19:35,070 --> 00:19:38,780
at the forgiveness here navigations
little bit hard in the second screens

333
00:19:38,780 --> 00:19:42,379
and first for stabbing a your area

334
00:19:42,380 --> 00:19:45,590
sue in this one you'll see and this is

335
00:19:45,590 --> 00:19:51,199
SC reserved from have certain stock
photo images that you found and created

336
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:53,820
an assertive

337
00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:57,730
and was like a stream of consciousness
in color based gradient

338
00:19:57,730 --> 00:20:02,420
and bad P just sort of search through
the stock photo sides

339
00:20:02,420 --> 00:20:06,080
and found things that tied into one
another and then you created this

340
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:07,730
incredibly long image

341
00:20:07,730 --> 00:20:11,840
embed you're sort of able to traverse
just by

342
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:15,149
looking at your browser and I am and
serve

343
00:20:15,150 --> 00:20:18,520
the browser becoming the frame for the
work rather than it being

344
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:22,250
framed and hung on a wall you're you're
sitting at your computer and your

345
00:20:22,250 --> 00:20:23,700
experience in this work

346
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:27,250
and Justin whatever space your ad am

347
00:20:27,250 --> 00:20:31,840
so now we're gonna we're gonna move on &
Dunn's gonna talk a little bit about

348
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:35,178
and assertive beginnings 02 Aaron I am

349
00:20:35,179 --> 00:20:38,200
and and where where we are

350
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:42,929
taking it so far alright yeah so back to
my commanding in fact actually

351
00:20:42,929 --> 00:20:47,679
om he had a.m. show that was it carried
it last year

352
00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:50,989
at highbeam that's a in New York City
and Chelsea if you're

353
00:20:50,989 --> 00:20:55,299
from the area and dished shows called
Street show the things between us

354
00:20:55,299 --> 00:20:59,929
in yet so

355
00:20:59,929 --> 00:21:02,940
and the end in the concept for a strip
show is

356
00:21:02,940 --> 00:21:07,869
some bad and I i our earning your view
from earlier with the US being dead

357
00:21:07,869 --> 00:21:08,600
drops

358
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:12,100
anyone out there as if we know system
and soon

359
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:17,609
so dead drops arm are USB sticks that
have been embedded in

360
00:21:17,609 --> 00:21:20,749
and buildings or other physical
sculpture Anna

361
00:21:20,749 --> 00:21:25,419
physical structures in public spaces and
the idea is that you can

362
00:21:25,419 --> 00:21:28,690
go up to these dead robson merit several
places where

363
00:21:28,690 --> 00:21:32,999
their aggregated unmapped and you can
see an example here this is the one at

364
00:21:32,999 --> 00:21:34,330
IBM I believe so your

365
00:21:34,330 --> 00:21:37,908
and and so you can take your laptop up
to them

366
00:21:37,909 --> 00:21:41,779
whole you know hold your laptop against
the wall you can see what files are on

367
00:21:41,779 --> 00:21:42,629
these things

368
00:21:42,629 --> 00:21:45,919
pull them all sometimes people we've
interesting things there you can we have

369
00:21:45,919 --> 00:21:47,840
interesting things there for other
people

370
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:50,999
you can leave malicious things there for
other people

371
00:21:50,999 --> 00:21:54,989
um so the idea behind the street show
that Michael had ways

372
00:21:54,989 --> 00:21:58,940
there is this conversation going on at
the time

373
00:21:58,940 --> 00:22:04,409
a ballot am taking works offline sue
collectors could have been locally

374
00:22:04,409 --> 00:22:08,350
when referring to Internet are 10 and
there is a lot of controversy around

375
00:22:08,350 --> 00:22:09,509
this idea

376
00:22:09,509 --> 00:22:12,929
because when you take care and and

377
00:22:12,929 --> 00:22:16,850
a worker bee Internet are of the
Internet did

378
00:22:16,850 --> 00:22:20,480
it is its use to you have the same power
than it did before

379
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:24,039
and still with the idea that he came up
with

380
00:22:24,039 --> 00:22:29,029
as assertive critique on this and and a
way to continue the conversation wise

381
00:22:29,029 --> 00:22:33,389
to curate this show am invite a bunch of
net artists to create

382
00:22:33,389 --> 00:22:36,509
Anna original work specifically for the
show

383
00:22:36,509 --> 00:22:41,389
and to give him the only copies of those
works and then he went and installed the

384
00:22:41,389 --> 00:22:45,359
this show on a dead drop and that was
the only place that these works existed

385
00:22:45,359 --> 00:22:50,379
from so and this is this is something
that weighs

386
00:22:50,379 --> 00:22:54,019
ways a little bit am frightening and
kids in

387
00:22:54,019 --> 00:22:57,149
the as among the hardest purchases
participating

388
00:22:57,149 --> 00:23:01,220
because this is something and you put
your time into creating a new work and

389
00:23:01,220 --> 00:23:01,679
then

390
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:05,159
you're giving the only copy away and
then there there are many possibilities

391
00:23:05,159 --> 00:23:06,999
of what could happen at that point

392
00:23:06,999 --> 00:23:11,940
someone could come and basically plug in
their computer and just trash on the

393
00:23:11,940 --> 00:23:12,720
works just

394
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:16,899
do with them someone could take all the
works often have the only copies in

395
00:23:16,899 --> 00:23:20,859
an accord them for themselves someone
could go into the source code and some

396
00:23:20,859 --> 00:23:22,739
other works for example web-based

397
00:23:22,739 --> 00:23:28,009
works am and and modify them and then
release them as if those were the

398
00:23:28,009 --> 00:23:30,590
original works but they're actually
modified versions

399
00:23:30,590 --> 00:23:35,830
and so at the time done whereas I'm was
actually a resident and IBM

400
00:23:35,830 --> 00:23:39,349
and down he's gonna pick up from where
we went with this

401
00:23:39,349 --> 00:23:42,840
yet so it was interesting oMG is that
the day it was installed I was working

402
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:43,320
there

403
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:47,549
and ives when a wide watching the
Twitter feed owners like people talking

404
00:23:47,549 --> 00:23:49,960
about the show one interesting thing
that I don't think

405
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:53,369
on he German mention that is it was
actually true that these

406
00:23:53,369 --> 00:23:56,529
will you couldn't get this stuff on the
Internet right which was pretty

407
00:23:56,529 --> 00:23:59,700
interesting is that its net art and
their net art is that a lot of people

408
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:02,919
no lot of people follow everybody's
tweeting about the show

409
00:24:02,919 --> 00:24:05,960
but the only people that have access to
these works a bit better physically

410
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:08,590
going to go to IBM so it's very similar
to

411
00:24:08,590 --> 00:24:11,939
you know where you think the traditional
gallery show you have to show up at the

412
00:24:11,940 --> 00:24:13,730
at the strange thing is that it was not
our

413
00:24:13,730 --> 00:24:17,259
so yet anything could happen here could
have been corrupted on

414
00:24:17,259 --> 00:24:21,279
people could have skewed simply taken
off the works to be nothing left behind

415
00:24:21,279 --> 00:24:23,039
what actually happened is that

416
00:24:23,039 --> 00:24:26,789
um we've hired at the mall and a that
was the start

417
00:24:26,789 --> 00:24:30,359
the 0 de Arte so throughout the day we
are texting back and forth and talking

418
00:24:30,359 --> 00:24:30,789
about

419
00:24:30,789 --> 00:24:35,279
what's going on here and I'm at lunch
and one out and omg my computer up

420
00:24:35,279 --> 00:24:36,509
copied all the works

421
00:24:36,509 --> 00:24:40,590
got home and arm we launch this website

422
00:24:40,590 --> 00:24:45,059
so arm we do this we had this idea and
we we

423
00:24:45,059 --> 00:24:48,359
talk to all day but what we gonna do and
then we realize that you know the best

424
00:24:48,359 --> 00:24:49,699
thing to do would be to

425
00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:53,099
tired all the stuff from a coworker we
know what are we gonna call this well

426
00:24:53,099 --> 00:24:54,168
you know its net art

427
00:24:54,169 --> 00:24:58,349
and comet 0 day because the gallery show
just launched that day

428
00:24:58,349 --> 00:25:02,428
so armagh we had twenty-four hours arm
and in this time we gave ourselves a

429
00:25:02,429 --> 00:25:03,730
limit up till midnight

430
00:25:03,730 --> 00:25:07,720
to figure out a way to do everything so
I think it was like 10:30 at night we

431
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:09,999
got started for some Galleria area is

432
00:25:09,999 --> 00:25:14,139
you recently reviewed 30 Blake we sort
of joke about it at the beginning today

433
00:25:14,139 --> 00:25:16,690
and I am at which it I should also
mention

434
00:25:16,690 --> 00:25:20,919
I had asserted personal an interest in
this because I was one of the artists

435
00:25:20,919 --> 00:25:22,309
included in the show

436
00:25:22,309 --> 00:25:25,549
so I really didn't want my work to just
disappear after having

437
00:25:25,549 --> 00:25:28,730
put the time in on and um

438
00:25:28,730 --> 00:25:32,509
but we we really did feel like this
where is from

439
00:25:32,509 --> 00:25:34,059
assertive

440
00:25:34,059 --> 00:25:36,809
we were taking a stance on work on on
our

441
00:25:36,809 --> 00:25:40,200
on on the conversation that was going on
and we wanted to say like

442
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:43,299
yes this is this is you know

443
00:25:43,299 --> 00:25:47,090
an interesting way to continue the
conversation by having mystery Joanne

444
00:25:47,090 --> 00:25:50,489
this is what we think should happen we
think that these works should be put

445
00:25:50,489 --> 00:25:52,409
back on line and they should be

446
00:25:52,409 --> 00:25:55,419
reviewable by the widest audience
impossible

447
00:25:55,419 --> 00:25:59,619
and they shouldn't be and their they're
sort of power shouldn't be neutered by

448
00:25:59,619 --> 00:26:00,559
the fact that

449
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:04,899
they're being taken offline so I'm we
joked about in the morning

450
00:26:04,899 --> 00:26:09,369
and same yeah I think done throughout
the term like 0 they aren't and

451
00:26:09,369 --> 00:26:13,489
and saying like yeah we should just like
pirate pirate this net art

452
00:26:13,489 --> 00:26:17,119
and we laughed about it and then like we
were like well actually we should do

453
00:26:17,119 --> 00:26:17,570
that

454
00:26:17,570 --> 00:26:20,689
and I am but we both had a lot of stuff
going on that day

455
00:26:20,690 --> 00:26:24,239
and we can get together and chill the
evening and then

456
00:26:24,239 --> 00:26:27,239
we just yeah I mean either Andrew
together this

457
00:26:27,239 --> 00:26:30,299
this sorta ask your template we we
polled there

458
00:26:30,299 --> 00:26:33,479
as some definitions is your day in and
I'm

459
00:26:33,479 --> 00:26:36,639
and assertive as Lucifer definition and
I'm

460
00:26:36,639 --> 00:26:39,789
art as we could come up with their and
then

461
00:26:39,789 --> 00:26:42,999
some and then reduced and put up there

462
00:26:42,999 --> 00:26:46,999
we we went from to the torrent file

463
00:26:46,999 --> 00:26:50,759
on The Pirate Bay and you can yeah we
can go back to their

464
00:26:50,759 --> 00:26:55,589
Aquino sure and yes oh and yes for an
hour and a half we got the domain name

465
00:26:55,589 --> 00:26:58,039
got the hosting that website up in a
Twitter account

466
00:26:58,039 --> 00:27:02,799
and we had a torn up on the Pirate Bay
so is a really busy evening

467
00:27:02,799 --> 00:27:05,899
but arm you know by midnight I am we

468
00:27:05,899 --> 00:27:08,960
really didn't know what was going to
happen but we had everything in place we

469
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:10,700
started tweeting about it and the people
had

470
00:27:10,700 --> 00:27:13,779
been following the show all day and
talking about it in curious about the

471
00:27:13,779 --> 00:27:14,769
works now had

472
00:27:14,769 --> 00:27:18,049
a place that they could go and get
everything so

473
00:27:18,049 --> 00:27:22,759
you know our there is no way of knowing
when Michael started this show what was

474
00:27:22,759 --> 00:27:23,710
going to happen

475
00:27:23,710 --> 00:27:27,039
but on that you know we took in a way
that was unexpected

476
00:27:27,039 --> 00:27:30,719
and down this was really beginnings
absurd AR so

477
00:27:30,719 --> 00:27:34,059
arm when issuing interesting thing about
0d art is that

478
00:27:34,059 --> 00:27:38,049
like um a lot of wares is there any
where's ends up on places like The

479
00:27:38,049 --> 00:27:39,249
Pirate Bay eventually

480
00:27:39,249 --> 00:27:42,559
and on we've actually had to you

481
00:27:42,559 --> 00:27:46,369
arm not consciously but on come up with

482
00:27:46,369 --> 00:27:50,549
are very similar om roles arm in have
people to help us

483
00:27:50,549 --> 00:27:54,129
just like you might find in the later
seen so we actually have

484
00:27:54,129 --> 00:27:58,339
people that arm for various releases and
again on you can see our website at the

485
00:27:58,339 --> 00:27:59,299
ready are dotnet

486
00:27:59,299 --> 00:28:03,089
we've had suppliers on and this is a
term that of course

487
00:28:03,089 --> 00:28:07,399
I if you're familiar with nowhere see
that you see maybe an info files before

488
00:28:07,399 --> 00:28:11,580
and again i'm for files again files that
accompany pirated software they give you

489
00:28:11,580 --> 00:28:14,889
information about me how to install what
the serial number is

490
00:28:14,889 --> 00:28:18,049
and a general information about the pot
the software

491
00:28:18,049 --> 00:28:21,440
we have people that supply and again
suppliers people that would actually

492
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:22,309
give us the

493
00:28:22,309 --> 00:28:27,168
I give us the software in this case the
art we have rivers as well because this

494
00:28:27,169 --> 00:28:30,320
arm again this the stuff

495
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:33,428
exists online so it isn't always the
easiest and

496
00:28:33,429 --> 00:28:36,960
come to get all the files of the
Internet on anywhere from movies to

497
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:38,210
pictures to texts

498
00:28:38,210 --> 00:28:42,179
and we've dealt with various works nom
and in various formats

499
00:28:42,179 --> 00:28:46,830
we also need people to help seed do and
down cedars again in if you're

500
00:28:46,830 --> 00:28:50,349
unfamiliar with bit torrent web it when
it works is that you are

501
00:28:50,349 --> 00:28:54,869
have a file somewhere up like on The
Pirate Bay Nova torrent file which is

502
00:28:54,869 --> 00:28:55,570
simply

503
00:28:55,570 --> 00:29:00,499
you know now man index it is not the
file is not the information itself but

504
00:29:00,499 --> 00:29:01,639
it's really an index of all

505
00:29:01,639 --> 00:29:06,229
files and a link to connect you to other
people that are seeders and leechers

506
00:29:06,229 --> 00:29:09,329
over peer to peer network over a peer to
peer network in the Cedars people have

507
00:29:09,329 --> 00:29:10,839
complete copies of the software

508
00:29:10,839 --> 00:29:15,629
and on the in the season appears our
people there are also

509
00:29:15,629 --> 00:29:21,460
you know are downloading rape and om and
we've had people actually help us see

510
00:29:21,460 --> 00:29:21,940
this

511
00:29:21,940 --> 00:29:25,359
and Dom which is very basic work on that
first night love our friends from across

512
00:29:25,359 --> 00:29:26,418
the street was over

513
00:29:26,419 --> 00:29:29,729
use in different apartment at different
internet connections there were used as

514
00:29:29,729 --> 00:29:33,579
and utilize the sneaker net serum get
the data over to him

515
00:29:33,579 --> 00:29:38,309
and the sneaker net if you're not
familiar is taking the date and walking

516
00:29:38,309 --> 00:29:39,539
over to someone else

517
00:29:39,539 --> 00:29:43,679
am so we we put this first release the
bars on a USB key

518
00:29:43,679 --> 00:29:46,759
and we brought it over to him so that he
could spell by seed

519
00:29:46,759 --> 00:29:49,879
from and get this and these files in the

520
00:29:49,879 --> 00:29:53,149
this show distributed more quickly which
bring this to you

521
00:29:53,149 --> 00:29:56,489
I'm how you guys can help um downstairs
in the

522
00:29:56,489 --> 00:29:59,929
art space on the mezzanine level we have
kiosks n/a

523
00:29:59,929 --> 00:30:03,940
am you might have noticed if used nephew
taking a walk to remember

524
00:30:03,940 --> 00:30:07,690
incidences order old CRT monitor
displaying

525
00:30:07,690 --> 00:30:12,759
NFL files and from and with 2400 2400
baud rate

526
00:30:12,759 --> 00:30:17,059
from and the easier than a profiles for
the releases we put out so far in

527
00:30:17,059 --> 00:30:21,359
connected to the monitor are two USB and
sticks then have all of the releases

528
00:30:21,359 --> 00:30:22,749
we've put out so far

529
00:30:22,749 --> 00:30:26,909
me along yeah I'm well they did when we
first put them

530
00:30:26,909 --> 00:30:31,499
but the installation there from and
along with the income per

531
00:30:31,499 --> 00:30:34,619
accompanying torrent files so

532
00:30:34,619 --> 00:30:38,460
if you were so inclined you could go go
down there

533
00:30:38,460 --> 00:30:41,940
grab all these releases grab a torrent
files and

534
00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:45,970
load them into your BitTorrent clients
and help us see the releases

535
00:30:45,970 --> 00:30:49,989
from we're gonna talk and done going to
talk a little bit about

536
00:30:49,989 --> 00:30:52,999
10 var releases the most recent 1i think

537
00:30:52,999 --> 00:30:58,159
actually I by an artist named Sarah wise
and this one was actually

538
00:30:58,159 --> 00:31:01,559
little bit of a different scenario for
why we ended up taking

539
00:31:01,559 --> 00:31:05,119
tignan on and releasing in 30 yard

540
00:31:05,119 --> 00:31:09,809
me and this is an example when the info
files that we have and again

541
00:31:09,809 --> 00:31:14,279
here we see that on just like %uh Norman
for filing the size the format the OS

542
00:31:14,279 --> 00:31:17,460
the curator the show now it's a little
bit different in a traditional where's

543
00:31:17,460 --> 00:31:18,799
info file

544
00:31:18,799 --> 00:31:22,179
as well as the location release name the
date

545
00:31:22,179 --> 00:31:25,749
you-know-who package it who supplied it
and then the URL to the show so we try

546
00:31:25,749 --> 00:31:26,599
to give all the in from

547
00:31:26,599 --> 00:31:29,970
information on when we release this and

548
00:31:29,970 --> 00:31:33,169
this again is Sarah's project called
internet is

549
00:31:33,169 --> 00:31:36,629
and I am this is and image on

550
00:31:36,629 --> 00:31:40,259
that is related to the show in this is
really the reason we ended up taking

551
00:31:40,259 --> 00:31:41,190
this on

552
00:31:41,190 --> 00:31:44,950
so arm I guess it's best to show the
show

553
00:31:44,950 --> 00:31:49,039
everything first and then we can on talk
about some love the reasons why

554
00:31:49,039 --> 00:31:53,179
we decided to release this

555
00:31:53,179 --> 00:31:56,429
gonna show here is actually home

556
00:31:56,429 --> 00:31:59,589
when I release voters I'm so what
happens like if u

557
00:31:59,589 --> 00:32:03,779
if you check out arm whenever releases
what you'll see so

558
00:32:03,779 --> 00:32:07,429
again trying to view from over here but
if you go into

559
00:32:07,429 --> 00:32:12,049
yes we have our mall love our folders on
me over files in here

560
00:32:12,049 --> 00:32:15,979
and some of them are on the info file

561
00:32:15,979 --> 00:32:19,710
we have I'm Sanjay pegs that where a
company company the show but then in the

562
00:32:19,710 --> 00:32:22,559
actual folder itself

563
00:32:22,559 --> 00:32:26,700
we have a do a directly Rep her website
where the show was hosted

564
00:32:26,700 --> 00:32:30,629
and we try to be faithful to the on my
work that we we have

565
00:32:30,629 --> 00:32:34,049
that we wrap and that's why we have this
index HTML but we also have one with

566
00:32:34,049 --> 00:32:35,210
relative links

567
00:32:35,210 --> 00:32:38,799
so the index HTML isn't actually gonna
work because of where every all

568
00:32:38,799 --> 00:32:41,819
love the hyperlinks point to the
different files

569
00:32:41,819 --> 00:32:45,609
so when we release it we in in addition
to doing straight rip up the side

570
00:32:45,609 --> 00:32:48,889
and I the art that accompanies it we
also

571
00:32:48,889 --> 00:32:52,639
on at the gym out that way can be
beautiful offline when you download it

572
00:32:52,639 --> 00:32:56,789
and any additional information that
you'll need is included in the info file

573
00:32:56,789 --> 00:33:00,169
so we had to be pretty on them pretty
comprehensive about everything so you

574
00:33:00,169 --> 00:33:00,879
can actually

575
00:33:00,879 --> 00:33:04,479
in on enjoy the do a two piece but also
if you want to see

576
00:33:04,479 --> 00:33:08,269
on everything arm you know the way it
was we don't wanna gonna spoil it

577
00:33:08,269 --> 00:33:12,229
and I believe that in in the case ive
and this work someone actually

578
00:33:12,229 --> 00:33:15,690
am downloaded this and after

579
00:33:15,690 --> 00:33:19,829
she took the site down someone actually
downloaded and is your day rallies and

580
00:33:19,829 --> 00:33:21,049
put the site back up

581
00:33:21,049 --> 00:33:26,259
using me index relative relative index
HTML file

582
00:33:26,259 --> 00:33:29,609
so is it was put back online again

583
00:33:29,609 --> 00:33:34,190
yet so am this shit and we'll just talk
a little bit about what is actual

584
00:33:34,190 --> 00:33:38,129
work was and why it ended up being taken
down by the artist

585
00:33:38,129 --> 00:33:42,889
from with Sarah Sarah participated in a
show

586
00:33:42,889 --> 00:33:47,099
and that was good curated at in
pennsylvania called what is

587
00:33:47,099 --> 00:33:50,220
internet and the artists were

588
00:33:50,220 --> 00:33:53,669
tasked with creating a original works
responding to this and would whichever

589
00:33:53,669 --> 00:33:54,249
way they

590
00:33:54,249 --> 00:33:57,720
and they chose sushi boosted the AM

591
00:33:57,720 --> 00:34:01,889
a job listing on the air aside for

592
00:34:01,889 --> 00:34:06,460
voice actors and she asked she said that
she wanted as many people

593
00:34:06,460 --> 00:34:09,889
and to respond to this posting is as

594
00:34:09,889 --> 00:34:14,379
they liked but with the understanding
that only one of them would be selected

595
00:34:14,379 --> 00:34:17,868
am for it actual payment for the job

596
00:34:17,869 --> 00:34:21,230
and did the voice actors were supposed
to

597
00:34:21,230 --> 00:34:25,299
tell tell her in their own words what
the internet meant to them

598
00:34:25,299 --> 00:34:28,779
from so what she ended up doing was she

599
00:34:28,779 --> 00:34:32,418
put put together a website where she

600
00:34:32,418 --> 00:34:36,868
linked all abuse auditions from the
voice actors

601
00:34:36,869 --> 00:34:40,279
with streaming streaming examples above
the audio that they

602
00:34:40,279 --> 00:34:43,319
and performed am and then

603
00:34:43,319 --> 00:34:47,460
she weighs going to allow the public to
vote on which was there

604
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:50,290
which one was the best and that was the
one that was going to be paid for the

605
00:34:50,290 --> 00:34:51,489
job

606
00:34:51,489 --> 00:34:55,059

weighs am

608
00:34:58,549 --> 00:35:01,619
representing all of these voice artists
and took

609
00:35:01,619 --> 00:35:05,380
issue with with the project and said
that it was a violation and their terms

610
00:35:05,380 --> 00:35:06,349
of service

611
00:35:06,349 --> 00:35:10,920
answer before she was able to even have
a public voting period

612
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:14,799
and the center a cease and desist letter
and Astor

613
00:35:14,799 --> 00:35:18,160
and to take down beside from she

614
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:23,239
contemplated sorted keeping an open and
fighting it am legally because she felt

615
00:35:23,239 --> 00:35:24,809
that the way that she worded

616
00:35:24,809 --> 00:35:28,700
and the job posting was within their
terms of service

617
00:35:28,700 --> 00:35:32,329
from but eventually she decided bad and

618
00:35:32,329 --> 00:35:35,520
she really didn't didn't have that the
time

619
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:39,119
or on the front via the legal backing to
get into your

620
00:35:39,119 --> 00:35:42,779
something like this and so we approached
her and said that we would be happy to

621
00:35:42,779 --> 00:35:43,710
help

622

make make sure that the work and then
she created lived on

623
00:35:47,509 --> 00:35:51,600
and and weighs Anna and would be
continued

626
00:35:57,700 --> 00:36:00,140

interesting project yet there's a

627
00:36:00,140 --> 00:36:01,879

653
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:41,359
your so now I we're gonna

654
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:44,870
we're gonna sort of go back in time a
little bit and talk about another

655
00:37:44,870 --> 00:37:48,009
project that weighs called aren't micro
patronage

656
00:37:48,010 --> 00:37:52,030
which ended up being a target does your
day are

657
00:37:52,030 --> 00:37:56,140
and them and then it played out in a
sort of an interesting way

658
00:37:56,140 --> 00:37:59,609
over over the course of six months so
art micro patronage

659
00:37:59,610 --> 00:38:03,080
is the side and that trying to create a
mano

660
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:07,029
Korea is is trying to create a model for
micropayments to

661
00:38:07,030 --> 00:38:11,830
artists have internet art some so what
they're doing is they're

662
00:38:11,830 --> 00:38:16,430
approaching curator's asking them to to
select a group of artists and then

663
00:38:16,430 --> 00:38:17,629
they're presenting them

664
00:38:17,630 --> 00:38:20,680
as they're presenting the Shari's on
their side

665
00:38:20,680 --> 00:38:26,109
art mag her patronage downward um you
can click through the shows and as you

666
00:38:26,110 --> 00:38:26,880
click through

667
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:30,060
and you the individual works your you're
given

668
00:38:30,060 --> 00:38:33,990
assertive am navigation bar on the
bottom

669
00:38:33,990 --> 00:38:37,670
that the window that allows you to
donate some small amounts of money to

670
00:38:37,670 --> 00:38:38,820
their to the artist

671
00:38:38,820 --> 00:38:42,110
from in doing so

672
00:38:42,110 --> 00:38:47,700
you I you ensure that you have continued
access to these works even after the end

673
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:48,250
of the show

674
00:38:48,250 --> 00:38:52,000
or so at as at their their model is
basically

675
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:57,090
like Iraq becoming a patron of the arts
you have continued access to these works

676
00:38:57,090 --> 00:39:00,870
if you don't donate them after the run
have one month

677
00:39:00,870 --> 00:39:04,560
bed show goes offline and it's not

678
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:08,650
it's no longer view more to you inserted
hitting up tell me that the people that

679
00:39:08,650 --> 00:39:09,440
have dominated

680
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:13,030
so the first show that they and

681
00:39:13,030 --> 00:39:17,880
that they put down boys won by Sarah
Klein it was called material motion

682
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:21,390
and we saw this as an opportunity

683
00:39:21,390 --> 00:39:24,910
in 402 yards assertive step in and

684
00:39:24,910 --> 00:39:28,480
archive these works and distribute them
again through

685
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:32,620
and through bitter networks in the
Pirate Bay and make sure that they

686
00:39:32,620 --> 00:39:36,339
continued had to be accessible to
everyone you wanna

687
00:39:36,340 --> 00:39:39,380
talk a little bit about the process im
sorry ive from

688
00:39:39,380 --> 00:39:43,370
something that like made the different
media formats and how we were able to do

689
00:39:43,370 --> 00:39:44,720
that yes this was

690
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:48,800
arm one where we needed some help
basically because it was alone with

691
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:49,050
their

692
00:39:49,050 --> 00:39:52,570
interesting thing again about is your
day project is that once this release is

693
00:39:52,570 --> 00:39:55,680
we'd understand if we hear about a show
what's going to look like what's gonna

694
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:56,240
have

695
00:39:56,240 --> 00:39:59,520
on as a party that what'd media until
the day it comes out

696
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:03,170
and down we can always afford to take
off work everyday shows going to be

697
00:40:03,170 --> 00:40:05,280
released some as the time it has eyes

698
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:09,350
as shows release in it germ-line I talk
there things during the day and at night

699
00:40:09,350 --> 00:40:10,610
we're working hard to get

700
00:40:10,610 --> 00:40:14,350
take everything and get it together so
the show was particularly interesting

701
00:40:14,350 --> 00:40:15,069
because again

702
00:40:15,070 --> 00:40:19,230
on has a rather complex arm on that
rather come back but it's a little more

703
00:40:19,230 --> 00:40:20,640
complicated because over the

704
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:25,370
the frames and the payments and there
where streaming movies as well as

705
00:40:25,370 --> 00:40:26,470
animated gifts

706
00:40:26,470 --> 00:40:30,060
and entire web sites that word that were
shown

707
00:40:30,060 --> 00:40:33,400
so you know the collection works it was
just one so

708
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:37,160
we've chatted you know safe able to am

709
00:40:37,160 --> 00:40:40,009
you know archiving everything but as
well as working around somebody's

710
00:40:40,010 --> 00:40:41,110
challenges

711
00:40:41,110 --> 00:40:44,540
so we actually had om we had i

712
00:40:44,540 --> 00:40:48,790
XR x two rivers here's where the for
shows where we had I'm jugar help us out

713
00:40:48,790 --> 00:40:52,980
with getting on some love these files
that we needed of

714
00:40:52,980 --> 00:40:56,110
love mom though as some in some the
streaming formats

715
00:40:56,110 --> 00:40:59,500
and I and now we have we had a

716
00:40:59,500 --> 00:41:02,870
reaction right away from art maker
patronage and A&M

717
00:41:02,870 --> 00:41:06,319
basically and the the reacted and two

718
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:09,970
to the release of the show because I
think we had

719
00:41:09,970 --> 00:41:13,140
we aren't we did something out from our
Twitter account there was a screenshot

720
00:41:13,140 --> 00:41:15,190
of the Google search results for

721
00:41:15,190 --> 00:41:19,190
I am for art micro patronage and the
first results were

722
00:41:19,190 --> 00:41:22,680
on the Pirate Bay links to our door and
I'll

723
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:26,440
and my fingers like the first five or
six rebounds and then after that was

724
00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:28,130
their website with the show on a

725
00:41:28,130 --> 00:41:33,580
am so we said like don't like curator's
artists like don't say we never you

726
00:41:33,580 --> 00:41:37,230
never did anything for you like that
we're increasing your visit visibility

727
00:41:37,230 --> 00:41:40,650
and and so in

728
00:41:40,650 --> 00:41:43,840
so as time went on am basically

729
00:41:43,840 --> 00:41:47,910
the this was the first show and they did
a six-month season and by the last

730
00:41:47,910 --> 00:41:52,330

740
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:26,770

00:43:42,130 --> 00:43:45,320
into the net art scene in seeing and how

760
00:43:45,320 --> 00:43:49,020
how be used to use order similar by

761
00:43:49,020 --> 00:43:52,569
but separate when you use can inform one
another

762
00:43:52,569 --> 00:43:56,420
so

763
00:43:56,420 --> 00:43:59,420
from through I had to read this

764
00:43:59,420 --> 00:44:03,859
purchase participation in the cream show
at art micro patronage we actually ended

765
00:44:03,859 --> 00:44:04,848
up becoming

766
00:44:04,849 --> 00:44:08,849
the most funded project in the entire
season

767
00:44:08,849 --> 00:44:11,880
over some I'm shows that they did

768
00:44:11,880 --> 00:44:17,210
and Sue now what we ended up doing with
the money that was donated was we split

769
00:44:17,210 --> 00:44:20,099
it between the Creative Commons the FF
in the Pirate Bay

770
00:44:20,099 --> 00:44:23,829
and we just took Graham because we felt
like we were

771
00:44:23,829 --> 00:44:27,260
we didn't really want to take this money
for ourselves for our first of all it

772
00:44:27,260 --> 00:44:27,710
wasn't

773
00:44:27,710 --> 00:44:30,810
it was in the a huge amount of money but
it also was

774
00:44:30,810 --> 00:44:36,220
from a way that we wanted to show served
their organizations that we support

775
00:44:36,220 --> 00:44:39,609
from and who we felt were related to
what we were doing

776
00:44:39,609 --> 00:44:43,328
and we will are since our release ways
they were was actually

777
00:44:43,329 --> 00:44:46,900
assertive compilation and the work have
many artists we felt that this was a

778
00:44:46,900 --> 00:44:48,089
more reasonable

779
00:44:48,089 --> 00:44:52,099
something to do them

780
00:44:52,099 --> 00:44:56,880
%um yeah I think we're just gonna I
think we only have about five minutes

781
00:44:56,880 --> 00:44:58,240
left so we're just gonna

782
00:44:58,240 --> 00:45:02,310
from rather than and talking anymore
we're basically at the end of everything

783
00:45:02,310 --> 00:45:05,700
we wanted to say we want to open it up
to questions and also just

784
00:45:05,700 --> 00:45:09,599
from any suggestions people have were
we're really interested in getting more

785
00:45:09,599 --> 00:45:11,210
people involved with the group

786
00:45:11,210 --> 00:45:15,130
if this is something that sounds
interesting to you we'd love to get some

787
00:45:15,130 --> 00:45:17,240
more people that are really
knowledgeable

788
00:45:17,240 --> 00:45:20,440
in in terms of computer security and

789
00:45:20,440 --> 00:45:25,200
from and think about other ways that we
conservative grow this project so any

790
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:27,390
questions feedback suggestions

791
00:45:27,390 --> 00:45:30,560
if you could turn out the light a little
bit so we can see on

792
00:45:30,560 --> 00:45:34,450
who is asking questions and who's trying
to leave her

793
00:45:34,450 --> 00:45:37,780
yeah thanks and can I it's quick
question

794
00:45:37,780 --> 00:45:42,680
your so I think a lot of this a yes we
allow this to me you know

795
00:45:42,680 --> 00:45:46,020
at this is certainly an important part
in this is political obviously

796
00:45:46,020 --> 00:45:50,339
and economic sense for americans a man
we live by the dollar

797
00:45:50,339 --> 00:45:54,190
so when this all happened Michael
Manning at Eyebeam

798
00:45:54,190 --> 00:45:57,760
I'm I know that there's a bit of a lot
of back and forth on that and someone

799
00:45:57,760 --> 00:45:59,440
was public and someone probably wasn't

800
00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:02,670
but do you guys how important was the
sole aspect love

801
00:46:02,670 --> 00:46:05,800
artists being able to make a living and

802
00:46:05,800 --> 00:46:09,200
what was what your work was how it was
affecting mad

803
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:12,430
I'm your obviously it's a very loaded
question but dis no I mean

804
00:46:12,430 --> 00:46:17,819
obviously both the bus being artists in
addition to participants in this

805
00:46:17,819 --> 00:46:22,200
in this group I'm you know I would love
to be able to live off my art when I

806
00:46:22,200 --> 00:46:23,770
don't think is reasonable

807
00:46:23,770 --> 00:46:27,849
is to you expect to be able to live off
my art

808
00:46:27,849 --> 00:46:31,760
based on a system where you're imposing

809
00:46:31,760 --> 00:46:35,780
an artificial scarcity on digital works
and trying to treat them like physical

810
00:46:35,780 --> 00:46:36,520
objects

811
00:46:36,520 --> 00:46:39,609
and that can be sold in the same way so
it's

812
00:46:39,609 --> 00:46:43,470
I think to to you to try and approach on
the Salam

813
00:46:43,470 --> 00:46:46,839
have internet aren't or digital art in
that way your

814
00:46:46,839 --> 00:46:49,869
basically creating an unsustainable
situation which is

815
00:46:49,869 --> 00:46:55,349
obvious based on what we've seen with
them and the movie industries and their

816
00:46:55,349 --> 00:46:59,140
this hors d'oeuvres from and the music
industry's and so

817
00:46:59,140 --> 00:47:02,980
their different dear part of what we
really wanted to do with this is say

818
00:47:02,980 --> 00:47:04,020
like you can't

819
00:47:04,020 --> 00:47:07,430
like take works offline that's not a
valid

820
00:47:07,430 --> 00:47:10,970
approach to to solving this problem you
have to do it you

821
00:47:10,970 --> 00:47:14,760
you have to think about other ways
monetizing these works

822
00:47:14,760 --> 00:47:18,230
that are going to be sustainable and are
actually going to work and are actually

823
00:47:18,230 --> 00:47:19,030
going

824
00:47:19,030 --> 00:47:23,270
to allow the works to continue to
circulate through networks

825
00:47:23,270 --> 00:47:29,200
this is

826
00:47:29,200 --> 00:47:32,670
media overly artificial question but to
what degree do

827
00:47:32,670 --> 00:47:36,140
CC with a are net

828
00:47:36,140 --> 00:47:39,970
itself an art project more than a
political project

829
00:47:39,970 --> 00:47:45,940
aka

830
00:47:45,940 --> 00:47:49,230
I M obviously many there is there

831
00:47:49,230 --> 00:47:52,430
it is it's a very open question and it's
something that we've talked a lot about

832
00:47:52,430 --> 00:47:53,098
but

833
00:47:53,099 --> 00:47:56,160
um I do you see it as

834
00:47:56,160 --> 00:48:00,190
assertive art project in itself I think
that its assertive

835
00:48:00,190 --> 00:48:04,869
am its to exist heard about the
intersection and wake

836
00:48:04,869 --> 00:48:08,270
on hacktivism like open culture from

837
00:48:08,270 --> 00:48:11,579
from conceptual art from

838
00:48:11,579 --> 00:48:14,660
and and and and it is something where

839
00:48:14,660 --> 00:48:19,190
we're trying to you from okay we have
two minutes we're trying a

840
00:48:19,190 --> 00:48:23,750
basically am create conversation around
this but we're also

841
00:48:23,750 --> 00:48:27,660
I in some ways we're curator's because
we're deciding which

842
00:48:27,660 --> 00:48:31,160
shoes that we work we won our represent
thriller

843
00:48:31,160 --> 00:48:35,670
through the side obviously we're not
going to release everything that follows

844
00:48:35,670 --> 00:48:40,270
under their on relevant earn an ardent
susceptible to being taken offline

845
00:48:40,270 --> 00:48:45,520
so its yeah it's something that is sort
of an ongoing evolution a

846
00:48:45,520 --> 00:48:49,730
for us and we're not we're not exactly
sure where the project is going to grab

847
00:48:49,730 --> 00:48:50,640
a wrap into that

848
00:48:50,640 --> 00:48:53,470
yeah oh definitely open we won and he
said with one of the reasons being here

849
00:48:53,470 --> 00:48:56,359
hope is really to make connections to
more people and talk to other people

850
00:48:56,359 --> 00:48:58,799
they may have interestingly really do
want to hear from you

851
00:48:58,799 --> 00:49:01,960
but we're definitely looking to kind of
go beyond I'd the

852
00:49:01,960 --> 00:49:06,849
model just releasing works arm out that
other shows and looking how you know we

853
00:49:06,849 --> 00:49:07,990
can actually help support

854
00:49:07,990 --> 00:49:11,049
artists and I am through all I love the
kinda Press

855
00:49:11,049 --> 00:49:14,369
and attention we've gotten through this
project so yeah we have kinda varied

856
00:49:14,369 --> 00:49:15,260
future plans

857
00:49:15,260 --> 00:49:18,710
and om and I and everyone hear from you

858
00:49:18,710 --> 00:49:22,760
yeah so I think we I don't think we have
any more time for questions please if

859
00:49:22,760 --> 00:49:26,530
you have any suggestions or questions
