1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,520
innovation not sure how many beer for
this organization I it's %ah

2
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:07,270
used to be called no says agency the NSA

3
00:00:07,270 --> 00:00:12,040
iron and on this post the picture up on
the screen now

4
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:16,539
I how they reassess that SIA

5
00:00:16,539 --> 00:00:19,720
that's as close as we could get to the
NSA are

6
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:23,580
that's a that's a a photo by AR

7
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:29,609
president the photographer Kyle are we
have the 2013 hacker calendar ready

8
00:00:29,609 --> 00:00:33,160
just came out yesterday and we have that
the 2600 store

9
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:36,550
and the theme this year or next year is
surveillance

10
00:00:36,550 --> 00:00:40,559
and we went down to Fort Meade Maryland
to take that picture to make con

11
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:43,800
one of the when the pictures for the
calendar on

12
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:46,950
and of course we got in trouble for this
her pretty quickly

13
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:51,100
are we are surrounded by for NSA police
cars I didn't know that was in SA Police

14
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:52,010
but there is

15
00:00:52,010 --> 00:00:55,769
and they kept us for about a half hour I
asking us questions oddly enough they

16
00:00:55,770 --> 00:00:58,039
didn't know we were taking pictures they
just want to know why you're there

17
00:00:58,039 --> 00:00:58,770
period

18
00:00:58,770 --> 00:01:02,480
are and do we have other pictures that
we didn't

19
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:06,369
yeah this is OK read the sign there so
many things you can't do

20
00:01:06,369 --> 00:01:09,409
I including read a sign that you're
driving by

21
00:01:09,409 --> 00:01:13,330
are but just to make it quick a another
of a talker P

22
00:01:13,330 --> 00:01:18,000
note-taking are making making of
drawings do not make any drawings are

23
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:18,890
you down there

24
00:01:18,890 --> 00:01:23,000
our maps are other graphic
representations all prohibited

25
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,920
it just goes on and on and on and on are
taking a picture of the sign is probably

26
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:29,090
for a bit into

27
00:01:29,090 --> 00:01:32,570
no I don't know any other way would know
what you couldn't do are

28
00:01:32,570 --> 00:01:36,340
no photographic image equipment media
recording sounding I'm sure it's illegal

29
00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:38,210
for all of us to be looking at this
right now

30
00:01:38,210 --> 00:01:43,470
what that is that is what we are faced
with when we go down to Fort Meade and

31
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:46,890
try to visit the National Security
Agency I its I

32
00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:50,950
its kinda scary it used to be a right up
to the buildings but now you can't get

33
00:01:50,950 --> 00:01:53,750
anywhere near them and I if you got
class you'll get questioned

34
00:01:53,750 --> 00:01:58,310
and just just for fun there's one other
picture we have here

35
00:01:58,310 --> 00:02:01,380
this is actually on a bunch of sheep in
England

36
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:04,539
by in the distance is on

37
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:07,619
are basically the antenna for old men
with Hill

38
00:02:07,619 --> 00:02:11,430
I which is a band massive receiving
station

39
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:15,020
I and our those radars they basically
covering

40
00:02:15,020 --> 00:02:18,340
a satellite dish is the reason there
round as you can tell where they pointed

41
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:19,930
it you don't know what you're listening
to

42
00:02:19,930 --> 00:02:24,370
art but it's an incredible listening
past they they basically are

43
00:02:24,370 --> 00:02:28,360
are getting just about everything going
over the satellites in that part of the

44
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:28,959
world

45
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:32,090
are but you know we were we pretend
we're taking pictures a sheep

46
00:02:32,090 --> 00:02:35,660
are for a couple of hours and cast some
pretty am

47
00:02:35,660 --> 00:02:39,970
a pretty nifty photography there I
anyway that a hacker calendar as well

48
00:02:39,970 --> 00:02:42,220
for 2013 all about surveillance

49
00:02:42,220 --> 00:02:45,280
on but now we have

50
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:49,709
II keynote speaker that I'm really
honored I had to be introducing here

51
00:02:49,709 --> 00:02:53,700
we've had many heroes speak on this
stage over the years

52
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:56,800
are basically people to stand up to
authority

53
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:00,980
people who question the rules are people
who are

54
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:06,060
who face a lot of crap for basically
saying what they think is right or or

55
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:09,519
or taking an action and I think that's a
model that

56
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:13,459
the whole hacker community should be
looking at as

57
00:03:13,459 --> 00:03:17,819
done as as something that scares us in
future years or in our present day life

58
00:03:17,819 --> 00:03:21,159
I it's all about whether you're in high
school where the your

59
00:03:21,159 --> 00:03:24,819
you're working for a government
someplace where corporation if you see

60
00:03:24,819 --> 00:03:26,129
something that's wrong

61
00:03:26,129 --> 00:03:29,670
you say something about it or you tell
people about it if you see a security

62
00:03:29,670 --> 00:03:30,269
hole

63
00:03:30,269 --> 00:03:33,610
you do something about it you let the
world now for you at least let the

64
00:03:33,610 --> 00:03:35,060
people that can fix it now

65
00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:39,180
many times you'll be blamed many times
the messenger is confused with the

66
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:39,840
message

67
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:43,540
and that's why we gather together to
share the stories of our

68
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:46,929
what we've been through are we in be any
work for the NSA

69
00:03:46,930 --> 00:03:50,700
for over 30 years as an analyst and the

70
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:54,560
believe me he's learned an awful lot in
that period of time

71
00:03:54,560 --> 00:04:00,370
I probably was we can with your that and
the people went there but I E

72
00:04:00,370 --> 00:04:04,140
must certainly was in the NSA buildings
that we saw just a moment ago

73
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:07,610
arm well after 911

74
00:04:07,610 --> 00:04:11,640
I he noticed a change in what the NSA
was doing he saw that

75
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:15,250
the technology was being used against
Americans

76
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:19,690
in our own country and that was too much
for him to

77
00:04:19,690 --> 00:04:23,120
to deal with and he became instead of an
NSA analyst

78
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:27,290
he became an essay whistleblower and I
think there's some

79
00:04:27,290 --> 00:04:30,440
there's nothing more courageous they're
standing up to such a powerful entity

80
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:32,210
and letting the rest of us now

81
00:04:32,210 --> 00:04:35,479
what's really going on and without it's
my honor to introduce as our keynote

82
00:04:35,479 --> 00:04:42,479
this Friday when Danny

83
00:04:47,449 --> 00:04:50,970
thank you very much to thank you to the

84
00:04:50,970 --> 00:04:55,210
coordinators have hope for inviting me
here I'm to give me the opportunity to

85
00:04:55,210 --> 00:04:59,419
express my story your summer it was hard
to believe I'm sure

86
00:04:59,419 --> 00:05:02,549
you'll find some a difficult bling I
find summer

87
00:05:02,550 --> 00:05:06,389
difficult myself to be even believe that
actually things like this happen

88
00:05:06,389 --> 00:05:09,910
in our government did these kinds of
things but I

89
00:05:09,910 --> 00:05:12,940
so I'd like to know what I'd like to do
is go through my entire

90
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:17,479
background with an essay in Howell how a
handled the vinson

91
00:05:17,479 --> 00:05:21,409
911 after that and and all the things
that

92
00:05:21,410 --> 00:05:24,449
happened with the department of justice
and ass after that

93
00:05:24,449 --> 00:05:28,880
plus a then I like to go into some other
technology that

94
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:33,300
is involved in large data and date is
database analysis

95
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:38,360
with you and then you my impression of
what the the white house's new

96
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:41,270
initiative and big data analysis is
really all about

97
00:05:41,270 --> 00:05:46,070
even though they can't say it correctly
this is really what they're asking

98
00:05:46,070 --> 00:05:50,449
hmm and I'll try to define it for you
and hopefully that'll give you some idea

99
00:05:50,449 --> 00:05:54,110
it'll certainly give you a better idea I
believe that I how

100
00:05:54,110 --> 00:05:57,280
these events occurring how dangerous
meta-data

101
00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:01,650
is a to monitoring the entire population

102
00:06:01,650 --> 00:06:06,580
as I'd said be 4n different forms then
KGB the stasi

103
00:06:06,580 --> 00:06:10,849
in the gestapo could never have dreamt
that having anything is

104
00:06:10,849 --> 00:06:16,130
great Orascom comprehensive as this
capacity to monitor the population

105
00:06:16,130 --> 00:06:20,580
their primary focus they tried to get
information about the population so they

106
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:23,590
could control it and that's
fundamentally what dictatorships and

107
00:06:23,590 --> 00:06:25,990
totalitarian systems to around the world

108
00:06:25,990 --> 00:06:29,360
and that unfortunately is the way our
government's going

109
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:34,539
into so I'll try to define what that's
all about the technology behind that

110
00:06:34,539 --> 00:06:39,190
and what they're asking now min in the
future spending hundreds of millions do

111
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:40,419
that yet the year

112
00:06:40,419 --> 00:06:43,419
the money you so my background a.m.

113
00:06:43,419 --> 00:06:49,690
I first the I was a hillbilly from
central western Pennsylvania Nike mao's

114
00:06:49,690 --> 00:06:51,919
small-town guy so I had small town

115
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:57,870
ethics and and across a hundred so I was
a marksman so

116
00:06:57,870 --> 00:07:01,260
this was in nineteen 65

117
00:07:01,260 --> 00:07:06,159
I E join the army as opposed to any
drafted in going in a rifle company ing

118
00:07:06,159 --> 00:07:09,919
being shipped to vietnam having to kill
somebody I didn't want to do that okay

119
00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:10,570
so I

120
00:07:10,570 --> 00:07:13,719
volunteered for the army to go to Europe
and so the

121
00:07:13,719 --> 00:07:17,729
semi through Ubuntu a battery of tests
in a city you're really in a good

122
00:07:17,729 --> 00:07:19,130
aptitude for this sir

123
00:07:19,130 --> 00:07:24,070
analysis I said because I was at a
mathematics degree in recent

124
00:07:24,070 --> 00:07:29,729
at my background mathematics so up so I
fit right into their to they sent me of

125
00:07:29,729 --> 00:07:30,750
doing

126
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:34,740
the traffic analysis school which ended
up to

127
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:39,090
the I thought it was going to be County
cars going by on the street or something

128
00:07:39,090 --> 00:07:42,250
sputter it turned out that the

129
00:07:42,250 --> 00:07:46,610
analysis serve updated data systems and
and

130
00:07:46,610 --> 00:07:50,240
codes in savers and things like that
basically what I

131
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:53,400
ended up doing in the military in and
eventually

132
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:57,950
and NSA got a hold on me after that and
so that started my career Sun

133
00:07:57,950 --> 00:08:01,039
I spent about four years the military
and I went in and say

134
00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:06,380
directly so so I ended up with about 37
years of service

135
00:08:06,380 --> 00:08:10,440
combined so my ear needs

136
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:14,150
that was mostly it was a lot of fun I
tell you was really a lot of fun

137
00:08:14,150 --> 00:08:17,870
breaking these puzzles and solving
problems and things like that so

138
00:08:17,870 --> 00:08:21,190
and that's really what I did I'm
fundamentalist are you working with data

139
00:08:21,190 --> 00:08:24,240
looking at data and data systems and how
you do that in

140
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:28,460
course I'd the background to a a nuclide
the by the way I keep mentioning this

141
00:08:28,460 --> 00:08:31,599
Euclid had a really nice little theorem
back in

142
00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:36,919
circa 300 BC where he said you know this
is the final rent

143
00:08:36,919 --> 00:08:40,328
no fundamental theorem of arithmetic the
number greater than

144
00:08:40,329 --> 00:08:44,540
monus dividend can be divided down into
primes are products that primes

145
00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:49,410
which meant that indeed indeed
assistance when you look at some if

146
00:08:49,410 --> 00:08:52,160
somebody's created a data system you
trying to figure out what the data

147
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:53,260
systems all about

148
00:08:53,260 --> 00:08:58,430
I'm mmm that kinda that that the room is
very helpful because you simply figure

149
00:08:58,430 --> 00:09:01,290
out how many possible combinations can
be generated

150
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:05,620
and is a look at a number then you
factored into its prime to look at the

151
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:07,640
prime combination say okay those are the

152
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:10,790
optional organizational properties okay

153
00:09:10,790 --> 00:09:14,910
if it's a matrix kinda thing with row
column combinations and things like that

154
00:09:14,910 --> 00:09:16,459
so you can you look at that

155
00:09:16,459 --> 00:09:21,060
as a way of doing diagnostics at the
highest level in sometimes it gives you

156
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:24,720
can you give me the idea how you can
simply go straight forward to a solution

157
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:30,199
by organizing properly in P allow you to
see what they're really doing so

158
00:09:30,199 --> 00:09:34,040
home in many cases it might be their
alphabet and tore

159
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:37,780
prop our city and you know things like
that in organizing the pages and

160
00:09:37,780 --> 00:09:40,240
structures like that some

161
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:44,140
but that was my my background is in and
and throughout throughout the whole

162
00:09:44,140 --> 00:09:46,910
problem

163
00:09:46,910 --> 00:09:50,300
I was there doing the tennis offensive
mmm I'm

164
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:54,640
and I watched all that happened

165
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:58,610
unfortunately that was so well known
that that was coming

166
00:09:58,610 --> 00:10:02,569
but that wasn't being believed by the
military

167
00:10:02,569 --> 00:10:08,240
man senior military people so a lot of
people lost their lives there

168
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:12,230
we lost over two thousand men i thinkin
offensive

169
00:10:12,230 --> 00:10:15,370
that kinda made it clear to me that it
was important to

170
00:10:15,370 --> 00:10:18,829
in in in in intelligence production

171
00:10:18,829 --> 00:10:22,360
to make sure you could get to the
solutions get them quickly and get the

172
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:27,520
results are then documented in some sort
reportable form that's understandable by

173
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:31,569
leadership I'm so that became that was

174
00:10:31,569 --> 00:10:35,099
drilled into me initially is the
fundamental driver

175
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:39,760
what was important to do in this
business

176
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:43,900
and so I I go around and unfortunately
the time in SA was

177
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:48,100
catch got so big that it started
stretching the managers have to

178
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:51,120
manage something so

179
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:54,790
but they started to do was break away
operations from technical support

180
00:10:54,790 --> 00:10:56,150
meeting

181
00:10:56,150 --> 00:10:59,250
no the engineers and computer

182
00:10:59,250 --> 00:11:02,459
pokes people would build things make
things a

183
00:11:02,459 --> 00:11:06,810
and execute things were take operational
requirements and translate them into

184
00:11:06,810 --> 00:11:07,670
meaningful

185
00:11:07,670 --> 00:11:10,770
systems that would handle the the
problem

186
00:11:10,770 --> 00:11:15,510
from and when they did that they broke
away what that did was it separated in

187
00:11:15,510 --> 00:11:19,959
in a say in the two real two camps with
two separate priorities

188
00:11:19,959 --> 00:11:24,089
on the one on the one hand operations to
her that priority to figure out

189
00:11:24,089 --> 00:11:26,100
intentions and capabilities at the

190
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:29,800
potential enemies and report them

191
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:35,170
and in the other hand their their
emphasis be key

192
00:11:35,170 --> 00:11:39,640
a structure that needed money to
function to building seed money

193
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:44,030
to maintain things the money meant
contracts need to support contractors

194
00:11:44,030 --> 00:11:45,780
once they got that going

195
00:11:45,780 --> 00:11:49,510
their emphasis then turned to money as
opposed to

196
00:11:49,510 --> 00:11:53,800
production and intelligence that that
that separation

197
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:57,280
was probably one other worse things I
could have done dirt

198
00:11:57,280 --> 00:12:01,290
and they're still separated by the way
but so that meant when I had an

199
00:12:01,290 --> 00:12:04,800
operational problem I had to try to
figure out who could help me solve it so

200
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:07,339
I try to go to people in that other
operational

201
00:12:07,339 --> 00:12:10,990
organizations and and trying to say you
know I have a problem you can you help

202
00:12:10,990 --> 00:12:13,020
me and things like that

203
00:12:13,020 --> 00:12:16,520
and they're all really reluctant to come
over and operations

204
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:20,209
some number one if you're if you're a
technical person like that you tend to

205
00:12:20,209 --> 00:12:21,040
be

206
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:25,140
over here in operations you know this is
where people get killed

207
00:12:25,140 --> 00:12:28,350
okay this is this is the real world in
over here not in

208
00:12:28,350 --> 00:12:29,580
in

209
00:12:29,580 --> 00:12:32,950
in in the engineering world and things
like that they can

210
00:12:32,950 --> 00:12:37,460
they can have time to to research to do
things like that too

211
00:12:37,460 --> 00:12:40,800
to do tried to do development

212
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:46,490
I'm and and basically what they trying
to do was large-scale development which

213
00:12:46,490 --> 00:12:48,700
was fundamentally the wrong way to do it
now

214
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:52,810
I mean if you try to do everything all
at once sometimes that just doesn't work

215
00:12:52,810 --> 00:12:53,640
in a few

216
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:57,189
consumptions anywhere along the line the
wrong then the whole thing feels this

217
00:12:57,190 --> 00:13:01,710
as I'll point out in some later programs
so

218
00:13:01,710 --> 00:13:05,360
I'm they were all reluctant to come over
and help me so I ended up having to do a

219
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:09,590
lot about myself so I tried to go around
anywhere I could in his aide just to get

220
00:13:09,590 --> 00:13:10,730
something done I would

221
00:13:10,730 --> 00:13:15,200
I we're trying to do then but but then
finally

222
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:19,430
eventually I found doctor john T we're
not supposed to mention their last names

223
00:13:19,430 --> 00:13:20,310
okay some

224
00:13:20,310 --> 00:13:24,520
I won't mention last names but he was a
guy is still a good friend of mine is

225
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:26,069
retired now too but

226
00:13:26,070 --> 00:13:29,970
in he was in research and he was trying
to do some

227
00:13:29,970 --> 00:13:34,950
automation Research will it fit right
into me because I was developing this

228
00:13:34,950 --> 00:13:38,360
concept the analysis was not an art form

229
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:41,790
it was a it was a disappointing maybe
not in science but

230
00:13:41,790 --> 00:13:46,219
a discipline that was definable than
rules and standards

231
00:13:46,220 --> 00:13:50,010
structure to it in order so that you can
you could lay it out

232
00:13:50,010 --> 00:13:53,840
in such a way that it could be coded and
executed electronically me you could

233
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:55,220
automate analysis

234
00:13:55,220 --> 00:13:59,440
okay so there was little does my whole
theme there and say there's

235
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:02,580
eventually that's really ended up to I
was the only one there doing that by the

236
00:14:02,580 --> 00:14:02,930
way

237
00:14:02,930 --> 00:14:06,220
a.m. so

238
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:09,230
I kept trying to find others tried a to
help me

239
00:14:09,230 --> 00:14:12,590
down through the years and every time I
went somewhere they're always so

240
00:14:12,590 --> 00:14:16,800
I'm the they didn't wanna join me but
they would take my requirements a hammer

241
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:18,920
writing it up so I can get more money

242
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:23,410
okay this this then requirement would be
taken down to congress me more money

243
00:14:23,410 --> 00:14:26,939
because sky is this requirement I need
to build something foreign to solve this

244
00:14:26,940 --> 00:14:29,200
requirement ninety lotta money to do
that so

245
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:32,290
so that's where the use me for a number
of years and I

246
00:14:32,290 --> 00:14:36,030
finally go why so much for you know I I
just cited a.m.

247
00:14:36,030 --> 00:14:40,480
I can write in your requirements you for
that I'm going to try to go do it myself

248
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:42,480
because you're not really trying to help
me

249
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:47,970
I in fact p during their period time I
ended up to

250
00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:51,260
my you know I tried to think of things
like vision statements to help

251
00:14:51,260 --> 00:14:55,840
motivate people to do things like in in
the secular nation research which we

252
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:57,210
eventually formed wire

253
00:14:57,210 --> 00:15:01,870
I addition statements like everything
all the time okay

254
00:15:01,870 --> 00:15:05,530
aim high and do better and my invision

255
00:15:05,530 --> 00:15:10,630
the out there up there their vision
statement seemed to me to be at least at

256
00:15:10,630 --> 00:15:11,790
that point I'm

257
00:15:11,790 --> 00:15:15,060
aim low and miss in

258
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:19,110
because they consistently failed I mean

259
00:15:19,110 --> 00:15:23,500
this this I mean and we are in
operations I mean you're online all the

260
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:24,310
time emmy

261
00:15:24,310 --> 00:15:28,750
you you weren't failure was not an
acceptable outcome

262
00:15:28,750 --> 00:15:33,330
her so I'm to try to combat that

263
00:15:33,330 --> 00:15:36,920
to to work a way around that

264
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:40,600
I is I took a I

265
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:44,350
a C or course now that's a contract
officer representative course

266
00:15:44,350 --> 00:15:48,100
which meant that I could now run
contracts

267
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:52,890
so I didn't need all that so the people
okay I would hire my own contractors run

268
00:15:52,890 --> 00:15:54,500
the contract locally

269
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:57,680
and tell them to do ski

270
00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:01,110
exactly what I want it done then I get
it i'd get an operational

271
00:16:01,110 --> 00:16:04,930
arm result because I wasn't getting it
otherwise

272
00:16:04,930 --> 00:16:09,250
so I'm I started the

273
00:16:09,250 --> 00:16:12,820
I started out I was running about that
several programs wanna which to

274
00:16:12,820 --> 00:16:16,280
I be conveniently am

275
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:19,990
I tried to lose lock in SA into this

276
00:16:19,990 --> 00:16:23,380
program so I I put together a

277
00:16:23,380 --> 00:16:28,120
an international coalition about five
countries and got an agreement signed

278
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:30,310
with them that we would all cooperate in
this

279
00:16:30,310 --> 00:16:35,250
program circle have locked in a say in
one say that agreement signed

280
00:16:35,250 --> 00:16:38,480
they didn't realize what was happened by
the time his son

281
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:42,230
it was too late what's up and

282
00:16:42,230 --> 00:16:45,340
but but the whole idea was to share
everything

283
00:16:45,340 --> 00:16:49,660
because we're all in a joint effort
there was a joint

284
00:16:49,660 --> 00:16:54,800
effort against the the Soviet Union and
and any other international threats that

285
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:55,390
threatened

286
00:16:55,390 --> 00:16:59,689
not just this country but every you know
our allies and friendly countries some

287
00:16:59,690 --> 00:17:05,400
around the world so be so I got that
program running and

288
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:09,730
and set up even a I set up a multi-year
source

289
00:17:09,730 --> 00:17:13,089
remote the country network web

290
00:17:13,089 --> 00:17:16,448
if you will so we all get on the web and
we would update our

291
00:17:16,449 --> 00:17:19,230
latest technical developments right
there and everybody to happen at once

292
00:17:19,230 --> 00:17:20,130
you know was so

293
00:17:20,130 --> 00:17:23,480
complete sharing process even in turn
when Anna say they can look at them if

294
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:25,000
they wanted to

295
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:29,230
so when and earn

296
00:17:29,230 --> 00:17:32,990
so we're that was going on pretty well
then we decide to we need to do this on

297
00:17:32,990 --> 00:17:36,410
a much larger scale because the problems
were so much

298
00:17:36,410 --> 00:17:41,990
so much larger then just this these
simple Ares I was attacking

299
00:17:41,990 --> 00:17:46,790
so and john taggert sorry don't traps at
me

300
00:17:46,790 --> 00:17:51,930
John an idea

301
00:17:51,930 --> 00:17:56,270
it's not as bad as CIA you know the CIA
in a totally different name

302
00:17:56,270 --> 00:18:00,090
here they just kind of your last name
zohar

303
00:18:00,090 --> 00:18:04,070
do better so we started the in

304
00:18:04,070 --> 00:18:07,120
we started this thing in automation
Research Center

305
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:11,430
and by pulling dealer multi-disciplined
so we got everybody in the same room

306
00:18:11,430 --> 00:18:12,640
basically

307
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:16,750
so where we're all working the other
computer people engineers and so on

308
00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:19,850
so we have a we have a promise eight
years the engineering parliament

309
00:18:19,850 --> 00:18:22,750
and this is the problem that you're
really focusing on so they knew what

310
00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:23,400
they were really

311
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:26,840
contributing to consider being in
isolation over on the side working in a

312
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:29,209
little box

313
00:18:29,210 --> 00:18:32,190
because when you create those little
boxes people in you know their boxes you

314
00:18:32,190 --> 00:18:34,080
know they stayed in their box lead in
really

315
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:37,939
in eg understand the enterprise approach

316
00:18:37,940 --> 00:18:43,090
so by pulling the disciplines together
we got that perspective the in a promise

317
00:18:43,090 --> 00:18:47,270
and that was the focus p so we wanted to

318
00:18:47,270 --> 00:18:50,530
you wanted to do that on a much larger
scale in an essay in the end the focus

319
00:18:50,530 --> 00:18:53,470
there was on automating analysis cuz I
was the driver

320
00:18:53,470 --> 00:18:57,060
everything because the analytic parts
about when you make a breakthrough in it

321
00:18:57,060 --> 00:19:01,860
leniently part 1 part of the enterprise
you can leverage that across the entire

322
00:19:01,860 --> 00:19:03,510
enterprise and make her

323
00:19:03,510 --> 00:19:06,750
and help success is another other
environments

324
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:12,820
whose his knee

325
00:19:12,820 --> 00:19:16,129
so so no

326
00:19:16,130 --> 00:19:19,450
when we got that's our going we year
started

327
00:19:19,450 --> 00:19:22,850
doing some wild n crazy things to say
the least

328
00:19:22,850 --> 00:19:25,920
which I thought would fit in your
perfectly their

329
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:29,100
outta there out of the box kind of
thinking and

330
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:34,050
also we took no legacy inputs and all
anything there was a existing was to us

331
00:19:34,050 --> 00:19:34,879
legacy

332
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:37,960
and we therefore said that there were
over gonna

333
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:41,350
start from scratch and figure out the
best way to do it

334
00:19:41,350 --> 00:19:46,190
and not adopt because the existing
system wanted you to adopt their legacy

335
00:19:46,190 --> 00:19:49,270
approach because when if you if

336
00:19:49,270 --> 00:19:52,560
if used had a good idea that everybody
wanted to support that mean you got

337
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:53,120
money

338
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:56,320
okay so these people here want the money

339
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:59,840
so they say okay well liked what we need
to do is you need to be dependent on our

340
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:01,810
legacy system so we make you

341
00:20:01,810 --> 00:20:05,260
in a structurally dependent to that
legacy system that way you have to feed

342
00:20:05,260 --> 00:20:07,110
us to keep going

343
00:20:07,110 --> 00:20:10,340
so they take some with your money that
way so that was their entire so I wised

344
00:20:10,340 --> 00:20:12,620
up to that one pretty quickly you know

345
00:20:12,620 --> 00:20:16,030
I was a and it was pretty clear to me
what they were doing

346
00:20:16,030 --> 00:20:19,290
and congress also picked up on that that
was the point then this

347
00:20:19,290 --> 00:20:22,370
really got us in trouble you know
becomes

348
00:20:22,370 --> 00:20:25,650
when congress found out but the time
things were doing they started to

349
00:20:25,650 --> 00:20:26,600
support us with

350
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:31,010
budget plus ups directed directly to us

351
00:20:31,010 --> 00:20:35,040
now on in a few other you it the budget
process is probably pretty

352
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:41,070
pretty year ambiguous ur obscurity
everybody in the country but

353
00:20:41,070 --> 00:20:44,620
there's a whole market process that goes
to every year and

354
00:20:44,620 --> 00:20:50,490
fiscal year 1 October on and so you ever
new markets are usually done in the

355
00:20:50,490 --> 00:20:53,679
but by early summer they're done in
there

356
00:20:53,679 --> 00:20:57,410
under review up to that point in the
they start executing the budget in

357
00:20:57,410 --> 00:20:58,740
October

358
00:20:58,740 --> 00:21:01,750
I'm so him

359
00:21:01,750 --> 00:21:05,040
those a budget plus ups were I am

360
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:08,720
in addition to the requested money from
by the administration

361
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:12,679
so this was above and beyond what
they're asking for

362
00:21:12,679 --> 00:21:17,620
and they were directed at us sperm so we
became very noticed there

363
00:21:17,620 --> 00:21:21,250
is getting money from congress be in
fact I N

364
00:21:21,250 --> 00:21:25,380
and one point ahead a couple million
directed to me personally by name and I

365
00:21:25,380 --> 00:21:27,679
didn't even dance for it so

366
00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:30,530
they the but they were what they were
doing was trying to stimulate is to do

367
00:21:30,530 --> 00:21:33,850
more crazy and wild things you know to

368
00:21:33,850 --> 00:21:37,310
so I i did some %uh those but weak bed
the

369
00:21:37,310 --> 00:21:40,480
one of the things was home I wanted to
work in

370
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:43,710
and and I'll show you the technology we
try to work it in

371
00:21:43,710 --> 00:21:47,770
was a latent semantic indexing where you
would take text and

372
00:21:47,770 --> 00:21:52,080
look at text in trying to assess it
relative other text

373
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:56,730
and see how it to if it related in with
the idea was to cluster

374
00:21:56,730 --> 00:22:01,060
relate related text so you can begin to
analyze common

375
00:22:01,060 --> 00:22:05,710
uncommon were related texting who was
sending them what they were saying

376
00:22:05,710 --> 00:22:09,450
so I tried to do that with about
mudslide

377
00:22:09,450 --> 00:22:13,940
talked about for nearly six thousand and
tried in one case and said that I'm

378
00:22:13,940 --> 00:22:16,960
okay I'm let's just try it here and

379
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:20,950
I'm when I got it set up another on a
computer there for me I said okay as

380
00:22:20,950 --> 00:22:22,250
10,000 items

381
00:22:22,250 --> 00:22:25,260
you know this is a small number okay

382
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:29,700
this is just a little chunk the CEO who
don't deal with the little chunk

383
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:33,620
well I came back into clusters were all
the screen there was absolutely no

384
00:22:33,620 --> 00:22:36,150
distinction in the clusters of

385
00:22:36,150 --> 00:22:40,179
because hmmm that told me they were
several problems with the

386
00:22:40,179 --> 00:22:44,169
latent semantic indexing one one I
discovered simply by looking at it and

387
00:22:44,169 --> 00:22:45,780
because when they start

388
00:22:45,780 --> 00:22:49,600
putting together matrices upwards and
comparing the major cities and things

389
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:50,480
like that

390
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:53,650
there's one dimension the for God

391
00:22:53,650 --> 00:22:59,659
that's the dimension update a the means
the multiple meanings of the words

392
00:22:59,659 --> 00:23:02,929
if they match a word it doesn't mean it
doesn't say it necessarily as the same

393
00:23:02,929 --> 00:23:05,429
meaning in context okay

394
00:23:05,429 --> 00:23:09,780
so it he might be the first second or
third meeting in the dictionary the word

395
00:23:09,780 --> 00:23:12,800
in one case it's Anna might be too lina
from one another case

396
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:16,480
so I'm be so it missed that dimension

397
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:19,730
word combinations

398
00:23:19,730 --> 00:23:24,070
but also the other real problem and
because we're looking at billions and

399
00:23:24,070 --> 00:23:25,710
things

400
00:23:25,710 --> 00:23:30,320
is Brandon probabilities combination
across multiple items

401
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:33,530
firm and on a large scale

402
00:23:33,530 --> 00:23:36,870
hundreds and thousands millions billions
of items

403
00:23:36,870 --> 00:23:40,530
it's just that no matter where you look
any word will

404
00:23:40,530 --> 00:23:43,639
or any any any common text will have a

405
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:47,409
a relationship to some other text at
those billions

406
00:23:47,409 --> 00:23:50,540
and conversely the ones that matches
will have other relationships and so on

407
00:23:50,540 --> 00:23:51,310
so that the

408
00:23:51,310 --> 00:23:55,030
fall back on themselves in the
probability is that you'll find no

409
00:23:55,030 --> 00:23:59,139
distinction whatsoever on a large scale

410
00:23:59,140 --> 00:24:02,880
so that meant they had to do something
to reduce the problem to a manageable

411
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:04,280
level where the meaning

412
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:07,580
where the latent semantic active
indexing would have some meaty

413
00:24:07,580 --> 00:24:11,080
and I'll show you how we did that here
mom

414
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:15,570
an hour how in my view it needs to be
done for the future

415
00:24:15,570 --> 00:24:18,908
so but continually went with our Sarka
we started to

416
00:24:18,909 --> 00:24:22,419
look at it this was into the nineties
and

417
00:24:22,419 --> 00:24:26,020
we said well gee with the intern was the
world World Wide Web and Internet coming

418
00:24:26,020 --> 00:24:28,590
along we have a real problem here with
this and I'm

419
00:24:28,590 --> 00:24:31,750
me talking about about sixteen people
total

420
00:24:31,750 --> 00:24:34,980
and we were running like four separate
find that someone

421
00:24:34,980 --> 00:24:39,110
one-time another programs to it with
those sixteen people you know somewhere

422
00:24:39,110 --> 00:24:40,830
he working on mobile programs

423
00:24:40,830 --> 00:24:44,220
so with its a very small so the people
we weren't

424
00:24:44,220 --> 00:24:48,850
we didn't take any crap you know we can
give many we didn't ask for any but we

425
00:24:48,850 --> 00:24:49,370
ask

426
00:24:49,370 --> 00:24:53,980
all we did was we needed 12 honest
straightforward talk

427
00:24:53,980 --> 00:24:58,260
in exchanging knowledge have different
disciplines

428
00:24:58,260 --> 00:25:02,540
and we we weren't hiding rebuilding
anything all we our entire objective was

429
00:25:02,540 --> 00:25:05,020
to solve the problem

430
00:25:05,020 --> 00:25:08,668
so when it came to the internet that's
exactly what we did in

431
00:25:08,669 --> 00:25:12,130
and I'll show you how big data analysis
will

432
00:25:12,130 --> 00:25:16,290
will be learned show tree how that works
and I can do that how you can look at

433
00:25:16,290 --> 00:25:17,370
them

434
00:25:17,370 --> 00:25:20,980
terabytes of data passing by you

435
00:25:20,980 --> 00:25:25,550
on a continuing basis I'm in it and see
what's in it without actually looking at

436
00:25:25,550 --> 00:25:28,060
what's in it

437
00:25:28,060 --> 00:25:32,490
and it has to do with melody in using
militate a relationship some

438
00:25:32,490 --> 00:25:36,580
butter in so the when we'd solve that
problem

439
00:25:36,580 --> 00:25:40,649
the the interior which is the what's in
Tennessee transition office at the time

440
00:25:40,650 --> 00:25:42,070
was the

441
00:25:42,070 --> 00:25:46,379
they were running all these
multi-billion-dollar transition programs

442
00:25:46,380 --> 00:25:49,480
so they they knew we were doing in fact
the guy wasn't the chief there was

443
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:50,540
friend a mine

444
00:25:50,540 --> 00:25:55,120
I'm and EE soon as deputy Dan said

445
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:58,409
the what could you guys do with the

446
00:25:58,409 --> 00:26:01,860
1.2 billion dollars

447
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:06,790
amor said now you know we overlook
immunity this is you know this is

448
00:26:06,790 --> 00:26:10,520
I'm you were we supposed to do with 1.2
billion okay well

449
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:13,620
let us give us a few days will look and
see what we could and

450
00:26:13,620 --> 00:26:17,550
we took a few days and we said the GE we
could

451
00:26:17,550 --> 00:26:20,678
a.m. we can upgrade the entire world
every

452
00:26:20,679 --> 00:26:24,580
reap every place we havin you know even
everything back here in the states

453
00:26:24,580 --> 00:26:25,699
meaning

454
00:26:25,700 --> 00:26:31,659
but we we can only spend about $300
million at that

455
00:26:31,659 --> 00:26:35,490
well I mean they went back in the city
this is really great you know need it

456
00:26:35,490 --> 00:26:37,700
started going downtown briefing in
single

457
00:26:37,700 --> 00:26:41,120
thus really what we should be doing own

458
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:45,030
at the same time there was a separate
issue with program called Trailblazer

459
00:26:45,030 --> 00:26:47,300
the monitor startup programs

460
00:26:47,300 --> 00:26:51,900
there with nothing existed there at the
time so but it was a play and programmed

461
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:56,220
for development so we were coming into
conflict with that

462
00:26:56,220 --> 00:26:59,350
I'm and I'm so

463
00:26:59,350 --> 00:27:02,740
also what we were coming into conflict
with was the

464
00:27:02,740 --> 00:27:07,730
what I refer to as the feasting by the
corporations that were leeches on the

465
00:27:07,730 --> 00:27:08,860
side and then it's a

466
00:27:08,860 --> 00:27:12,169
another NTC the government

467
00:27:12,169 --> 00:27:16,060
I'm I refer to that process so

468
00:27:16,060 --> 00:27:20,940
government feeding all these
corporations is the military-industrial

469
00:27:20,940 --> 00:27:23,990
come happiness management complex

470
00:27:23,990 --> 00:27:27,630
you know they're keeping each other
happy they would retire from government

471
00:27:27,630 --> 00:27:30,929
go do that work for those corporations
the Corporation said people in the

472
00:27:30,929 --> 00:27:32,130
manage that

473
00:27:32,130 --> 00:27:36,060
programs and they get the contracts back
to feed some more it was all a feasting

474
00:27:36,060 --> 00:27:37,940
program in its still going on

475
00:27:37,940 --> 00:27:43,810
I mean that's why we have for that's why
we have such a large debt

476
00:27:43,810 --> 00:27:49,240
and be any rate term shortly after they
were briefing at Downtown

477
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:52,669
the dnt 0 office that they were planning
on doing this with us

478
00:27:52,669 --> 00:27:57,250
a.m. the chief at the anti over was
fired

479
00:27:57,250 --> 00:28:02,280
because heat in Cork conform to the
corporate position

480
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:05,750
which was to feed feed the corporation's

481
00:28:05,750 --> 00:28:10,419
that existed on the side of an essay in
I mean sister

482
00:28:10,419 --> 00:28:14,770
so what they did worse a.m. in order to
correct the problem

483
00:28:14,770 --> 00:28:17,990
and it's a management brought in

484
00:28:17,990 --> 00:28:21,429
and have hired him on directly to take
over the interior which is a

485
00:28:21,429 --> 00:28:26,210
a senior executive position they hired a
vice president at this AICD commune in

486
00:28:26,210 --> 00:28:28,530
manage that

487
00:28:28,530 --> 00:28:32,879
no you consequence let you know it's
what might happen with the course the

488
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:37,510
that that meant in sanc got some large
chunks a contracts

489
00:28:37,510 --> 00:28:41,150
which they did be 'em

490
00:28:41,150 --> 00:28:44,659
in a course at the same time in the same
even transferred

491
00:28:44,659 --> 00:28:48,669
the Sark to the same organization the
seamen

492
00:28:48,669 --> 00:28:52,720
so he was managing all that and the
first thing he did he calls me up

493
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:56,900
to his office and them

494
00:28:56,900 --> 00:29:00,520
he he he said first thing he said to me
in the office there was I know when you

495
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:01,250
briefing

496
00:29:01,250 --> 00:29:04,720
thin thread which is our program to do
the World Wide Web

497
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:09,929
to anyone anymore that's because it was
showing success and he didn't want

498
00:29:09,929 --> 00:29:12,230
success being showed because

499
00:29:12,230 --> 00:29:15,860
that means you solve the problem that
means in the prom dance for the money

500
00:29:15,860 --> 00:29:19,340
to get them feeding for all the
corporations you know it's a circle just

501
00:29:19,340 --> 00:29:22,500
keeps going round the room

502
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:26,190
but that's the process it still going on
right now

503
00:29:26,190 --> 00:29:31,340
I'm and unfortunately there was it so
that basically told me

504
00:29:31,340 --> 00:29:34,760
you know I'm the way I put it here is
the

505
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:37,980
the forces the people are too numerous
here

506
00:29:37,980 --> 00:29:41,830
so i'd I said I was going to resign it
wasn't anything I could do internally in

507
00:29:41,830 --> 00:29:42,540
an essay

508
00:29:42,540 --> 00:29:46,428
the entire leadership in and say it was
focused this way and they weren't

509
00:29:46,429 --> 00:29:52,470
they want no no creativity no innovation
no problem solved

510
00:29:52,470 --> 00:29:56,220
the two men to as I came up with the
later

511
00:29:56,220 --> 00:30:00,639
version of their vision statement the
they want them

512
00:30:00,639 --> 00:30:04,530
keep the problem going so the money
keeps flowing

513
00:30:04,530 --> 00:30:07,668
that was their nuclear there was a
vision statement all along I just didn't

514
00:30:07,669 --> 00:30:08,340
realize it

515
00:30:08,340 --> 00:30:12,710
you know I was this naive hillbilly from
the hills in pennsylvania

516
00:30:12,710 --> 00:30:17,090
thinking operations was important
instead it was the money in the flowing

517
00:30:17,090 --> 00:30:20,710
in the feeding in the feasting

518
00:30:20,710 --> 00:30:26,470
so im so I basically at that point
announced my retirement I was leaving

519
00:30:26,470 --> 00:30:29,669
and I was the but you alive

520
00:30:29,669 --> 00:30:34,110
2001 I'm

521
00:30:34,110 --> 00:30:38,350
and then and so I was at that point from
there on I wasn't sure anything

522
00:30:38,350 --> 00:30:41,190
internally within a say I was

523
00:30:41,190 --> 00:30:45,369
cleaning up all my papers I had to you
know it'll what kinds of things I had to

524
00:30:45,369 --> 00:30:48,830
pass up to the archives and different
people internally in as a slinky keep

525
00:30:48,830 --> 00:30:49,330
them from

526
00:30:49,330 --> 00:30:53,590
for the records for know here's how the
solution work you know it was actually

527
00:30:53,590 --> 00:30:57,290
10 sold out it wasn't done in the
computer gnome

528
00:30:57,290 --> 00:31:01,090
the point is that miracles don't happen
in the computer they happen in your mind

529
00:31:01,090 --> 00:31:03,280
and you relate them on paper

530
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:07,250
you could see them on paper and then
then you build the programs to manage

531
00:31:07,250 --> 00:31:09,159
them

532
00:31:09,159 --> 00:31:12,790
hmm so I mean computers can do serve a
certain amount but

533
00:31:12,790 --> 00:31:16,389
to fundamentally the trick is to get the

534
00:31:16,389 --> 00:31:20,190
get your mind wrapped around the problem
to where you can understand it to the

535
00:31:20,190 --> 00:31:22,250
point where you can see into it

536
00:31:22,250 --> 00:31:26,960
and begin to breaking apart and solvent

537
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:31,070
so in any rate 9/11 happened and

538
00:31:31,070 --> 00:31:34,090
so I started thinking ninety you know
I'm

539
00:31:34,090 --> 00:31:39,040
maybe I should reconsider retiring
because at 1. I always wanted them

540
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:42,700
do something positive likes stop the bad
guys even even though there's all this

541
00:31:42,700 --> 00:31:43,850
corruption around me

542
00:31:43,850 --> 00:31:47,510
you know

543
00:31:47,510 --> 00:31:50,560
but to it must have been

544
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:54,940
right after the few days no more than a
week after a 911

545
00:31:54,940 --> 00:31:58,190
at the decided to begin actively

546
00:31:58,190 --> 00:32:01,550
spying on everyone in this country

547
00:32:01,550 --> 00:32:06,040
nom and they were doing it by taking
billing data from telecoms

548
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:09,980
by when I didn't know at the time was
the charm

549
00:32:09,980 --> 00:32:14,830
in February 2001 they had already
started requesting that data from

550
00:32:14,830 --> 00:32:17,060
different telecoms

551
00:32:17,060 --> 00:32:20,470
this is when the CEO of quest

552
00:32:20,470 --> 00:32:23,690
refused and many went into court and
testify to that

553
00:32:23,690 --> 00:32:27,270
him that he was approached by some
three-star general administered a

554
00:32:27,270 --> 00:32:31,619
to provide a customer data

555
00:32:31,619 --> 00:32:35,330
but that wasn't February have 2001

556
00:32:35,330 --> 00:32:39,510
well the point was that we had put our
system together

557
00:32:39,510 --> 00:32:43,330
off from and Internet functioning in
November of 2000

558
00:32:43,330 --> 00:32:47,050
so there's three months after that which
meant that

559
00:32:47,050 --> 00:32:50,710
they wouldn't that back part of our
program

560
00:32:50,710 --> 00:32:54,080
to run all is spying right so

561
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:57,080
that's that's exactly what they did

562
00:32:57,080 --> 00:33:00,710
so many started taking a telecom data an
expanded after that

563
00:33:00,710 --> 00:33:06,750
so I mean the 1i knew was AT&T in that
one provided 320 million records every

564
00:33:06,750 --> 00:33:08,409
day

565
00:33:08,409 --> 00:33:11,409
I was just phone calls and then when
they got the taps in like the ones in

566
00:33:11,409 --> 00:33:12,889
San Francisco

567
00:33:12,889 --> 00:33:19,889
they started the nearest devices to take
care take the date of the Internet

568
00:33:20,330 --> 00:33:25,350
so what i did. after there was a I was
naive enough to think that the

569
00:33:25,350 --> 00:33:28,710
government but really if it

570
00:33:28,710 --> 00:33:32,389
people in certain positions the
government knew this was going on

571
00:33:32,389 --> 00:33:35,590
that they would take some action to
correct it or at least bring it back

572
00:33:35,590 --> 00:33:37,619
into some constitutional formal

573
00:33:37,619 --> 00:33:43,190
a or some process that was
constitutionally acceptable

574
00:33:43,190 --> 00:33:46,550
you know so I I kept by

575
00:33:46,550 --> 00:33:49,629
I went to first I went to the house
Senate the

576
00:33:49,629 --> 00:33:53,950
his house Intelligence Committee the
Etsy and the staff member that I

577
00:33:53,950 --> 00:33:54,940
personally knew their

578
00:33:54,940 --> 00:33:58,720
and on and she then went to

579
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:03,030
them Porter Goss who was the chairman of
the committee and also

580
00:34:03,030 --> 00:34:06,530
ninety-plus he was the deputy where the
I'm

581
00:34:06,530 --> 00:34:09,779
minority RAM

582
00:34:09,780 --> 00:34:13,000
they were all briefed into the program
at the time by the way

583
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:16,030
and all the other programs are going on
including all these

584
00:34:16,030 --> 00:34:19,510
CIA programs I'm

585
00:34:19,510 --> 00:34:23,810
and dairy porter goss referred her to

586
00:34:23,810 --> 00:34:28,070
a general Hayden out at an assay well I
mean you know

587
00:34:28,070 --> 00:34:31,350
it's going back to the room origin of
this program so

588
00:34:31,350 --> 00:34:35,210
anyone out there and of course he talked
she talked to him in the

589
00:34:35,210 --> 00:34:36,590
he said the course the

590
00:34:36,590 --> 00:34:39,639
we don't have to worry about that now
talk been proved by the way %uh since

591
00:34:39,639 --> 00:34:40,510
legal system

592
00:34:40,510 --> 00:34:44,040
to spying and everybody then was legal
internally

593
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:47,879
it was all written up in members by you
when I guess others

594
00:34:47,879 --> 00:34:51,239
held in in fact I know the

595
00:34:51,240 --> 00:34:55,330
the NSA lawyer went down to adding to
his office in

596
00:34:55,330 --> 00:34:59,009
in cheney's who is ready to change the
office he

597
00:34:59,010 --> 00:35:02,780
addington which is a legal wrap their

598
00:35:02,780 --> 00:35:06,600
any asked for the memos that the

599
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:09,779
said that the spying was legal so we'd
happy

600
00:35:09,780 --> 00:35:14,810
written record documentation so that his
ass was not on the line you know

601
00:35:14,810 --> 00:35:21,350
and he never got a course because if he
got anything like then I don't think

602
00:35:21,350 --> 00:35:24,100
anything like that was written because
there would be direct evidence for

603
00:35:24,100 --> 00:35:24,880
impeachment

604
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:29,160
so that they didn't do that some

605
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:32,460
and then get the record so they kept
going in

606
00:35:32,460 --> 00:35:36,040
and that program was reauthorized every
45 days by the

607
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:39,160
but I called the yes committee which was
Hayden

608
00:35:39,160 --> 00:35:45,649
tenant in that the OJ so

609
00:35:45,650 --> 00:35:49,700
for Charlie after that I mean I went
from there i went to we

610
00:35:49,700 --> 00:35:52,670
occurred because they're I wasn't alone
in this by the way they're like there

611
00:35:52,670 --> 00:35:54,230
were four others have been it's a

612
00:35:54,230 --> 00:35:58,109
and one staff from the atty one-member
the stair

613
00:35:58,109 --> 00:36:01,930
we're all trying to work internally in
the government over these years trying

614
00:36:01,930 --> 00:36:03,009
to get them to

615
00:36:03,010 --> 00:36:07,160
come around being constitutionally
acceptable and take it into the courts

616
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:09,140
near the courts oversight a bit too

617
00:36:09,140 --> 00:36:14,420
I'm so we we naively kept thinking that
they could do

618
00:36:14,420 --> 00:36:18,140
that could happen in it never did

619
00:36:18,140 --> 00:36:22,118
in fact even now they're trying keep all
these issues are the court that's why I

620
00:36:22,119 --> 00:36:24,290
signed the affidavit 3 EF after

621
00:36:24,290 --> 00:36:31,290
to help to testified I wanted to testify
in court about all the snow yeah because

622
00:36:31,950 --> 00:36:36,930
in my mind these people are still I'm
hiding behind a school

623
00:36:36,930 --> 00:36:42,069
national security curtain in all I wanna
do is

624
00:36:42,070 --> 00:36:45,930
move there in Sin City seed don't pay me
to don't pay pay attention that man

625
00:36:45,930 --> 00:36:47,930
behind the curtain because he's
affecting you

626
00:36:47,930 --> 00:36:52,950
he's thinking everyone ovens I mean

627
00:36:52,950 --> 00:36:56,000
in my mind was slightly

628
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:59,040
that they said we're going down a
slippery slope towards to tell it

629
00:36:59,040 --> 00:36:59,950
Arianism

630
00:36:59,950 --> 00:37:03,850
that's why I told him them for that I
thought we were about that far from a

631
00:37:03,850 --> 00:37:05,290
totalitarian state

632
00:37:05,290 --> 00:37:08,290
at least everything is set to make dad

633
00:37:08,290 --> 00:37:11,759
turn et qui in at that happen

634
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:16,490
not because the government's now
intimidating people in different ways in

635
00:37:16,490 --> 00:37:20,080
you know that this near this

636
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:24,509
thing about being able to pick you apart
the street and tried you with things and

637
00:37:24,510 --> 00:37:25,350
keep you

638
00:37:25,350 --> 00:37:29,150
isolated from no you get no due process
and things like that

639
00:37:29,150 --> 00:37:33,380
that was that's just been found course
German Constitutional which it is

640
00:37:33,380 --> 00:37:36,609
and everything they're doing his own
constitution that's where they're trying

641
00:37:36,609 --> 00:37:37,660
to keep the affair

642
00:37:37,660 --> 00:37:41,040
lawsuit of out at the supreme court
because at that point B

643
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:44,160
they're afraid it'll be you ruled
unconstitutional

644
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:49,339
and they're more house of cards will
fall that's really what's driving

645
00:37:49,340 --> 00:37:52,830
but any rate after that and

646
00:37:52,830 --> 00:37:56,380
all the stuff we were doing a they
decided to

647
00:37:56,380 --> 00:38:01,070
Raiders to keep this quiet threaten
issue no so we're rated them

648
00:38:01,070 --> 00:38:04,070
simultaneously for this the we went by
the way

649
00:38:04,070 --> 00:38:09,859
I did forget to mention we did sign the
the complaint to the Dudi Jesus about

650
00:38:09,859 --> 00:38:12,710
all the corruption and in a saleable
though all this feeding

651
00:38:12,710 --> 00:38:16,430
I mean they provide a hotline that said

652
00:38:16,430 --> 00:38:20,600
you know if you see waste fraud and
abuse you're supposed to report it here

653
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:24,160
this is government policy so the animals
do i'd

654
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:29,170
so so we did in the course they sent the
FBI to

655
00:38:29,170 --> 00:38:35,290
visit us in my case they came in with
guns drawn and why they did that but

656
00:38:35,290 --> 00:38:36,259
they did some

657
00:38:36,260 --> 00:38:41,060
I made in re I mean like I said before
I've been shot at

658
00:38:41,060 --> 00:38:45,730
mostly I am totally by most lead most
the time now is shot at it was by

659
00:38:45,730 --> 00:38:49,350
deer hunters when I was out hunting in
pennsylvania words

660
00:38:49,350 --> 00:38:52,490
and the guys coming down were from New
York

661
00:38:52,490 --> 00:38:56,670
I mean they which you did anything
happen

662
00:38:56,670 --> 00:38:59,820
how a year lease bullets coming by my
head you know I

663
00:38:59,820 --> 00:39:04,050
a mi canal United I and shoot back
because certain

664
00:39:04,050 --> 00:39:10,160
I would miss you know I to

665
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:14,390
so irate after he got raided by

666
00:39:14,390 --> 00:39:19,040
the came in and took our computers and
everything in

667
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:22,810
in in an over that over time they'd
wanted to keep us

668
00:39:22,810 --> 00:39:26,420
continually quiet this raid by the way
happened the day after the

669
00:39:26,420 --> 00:39:30,130
that the second morning after am

670
00:39:30,130 --> 00:39:33,960
Attorney General Gonzalez is testimony
to the Senate Intelligence you

671
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:39,470
Judiciary Committee where is testifying
to these

672
00:39:39,470 --> 00:39:43,800
surveillance programs and the when he
referred to as the TSP

673
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:47,580
through surveillance program which was a
buncha programs

674
00:39:47,580 --> 00:39:51,340
some and the one that we're talking
about spying on Americans everybody in

675
00:39:51,340 --> 00:39:53,590
this country was called star windy never

676
00:39:53,590 --> 00:39:57,670
you never address that when all so they
were afraid that we would go to the

677
00:39:57,670 --> 00:39:58,900
committee in

678
00:39:58,900 --> 00:40:03,940
telling what he never told them so they
wanted to keep this quiet in that way to

679
00:40:03,940 --> 00:40:09,160
nom that's why the the religious right
after his testimony because the realized

680
00:40:09,160 --> 00:40:10,120
that

681
00:40:10,120 --> 00:40:13,680
we had had a history a visit in
committees you known

682
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:17,120
well since we knew what the program is
all about we were probably

683
00:40:17,120 --> 00:40:20,700
would take a shot at the Judiciary
Committee since now the other committees

684
00:40:20,700 --> 00:40:22,870
were paying any attention

685
00:40:22,870 --> 00:40:26,750
so anyhow

686
00:40:26,750 --> 00:40:31,109
that was a there was the

687
00:40:31,109 --> 00:40:34,509
and experience but to it didn't

688
00:40:34,510 --> 00:40:39,150
I mean had I didn't didn't scare me what
it did was make me mad

689
00:40:39,150 --> 00:40:43,690
and I'm I was getting mad well they were
still there

690
00:40:43,690 --> 00:40:47,720
in fact I got so mad I accused and being
sent there by somebody else in it

691
00:40:47,720 --> 00:40:51,270
you know none now said reason you're
really hears you want to keep quiet

692
00:40:51,270 --> 00:40:55,070
about stellar wind and his with this
program does spying on Americans taking

693
00:40:55,070 --> 00:40:56,400
all the data in

694
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:59,960
and explain this to me in on my back
porch

695
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:03,350
and doing a deal the head agent there

696
00:41:03,350 --> 00:41:08,380
special agent Paul Marek who signed the
affidavit with the punch lines to get

697
00:41:08,380 --> 00:41:08,780
the

698
00:41:08,780 --> 00:41:13,020
judge to sign in below that the judge
who remain

699
00:41:13,020 --> 00:41:17,000
when we're still p we dealing with them

700
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:21,780
am being quiet is not one thing I'm
going to do by the way

701
00:41:21,780 --> 00:41:28,780
I will not have not said here in active

702
00:41:36,290 --> 00:41:38,730
well night and I'm not alone so I

703
00:41:38,730 --> 00:41:41,440
you need to know that there are other
people who were with me like five with

704
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:41,890
us

705
00:41:41,890 --> 00:41:46,580
who came in and then we ran into people
who were downtown Washington gap anh

706
00:41:46,580 --> 00:41:48,440
deff an ACLU

707
00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:51,440
when we're dealing with and move on
operating with all them trying to help

708
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:51,990
them to

709
00:41:51,990 --> 00:41:55,230
so so we're alone there's a large

710
00:41:55,230 --> 00:41:59,200
me out there which we didn't know at the
time cuz we and now is a backpack

711
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:02,580
room guy from NASA bro code you know I
came out indeed

712
00:42:02,580 --> 00:42:05,590
what's the world really about out here
you know so

713
00:42:05,590 --> 00:42:08,640
this is all new to me to be wealthy this
out but

714
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:12,580
but I wasn't gonna sit by and let the
FBI

715
00:42:12,580 --> 00:42:17,400
do what they were doing so so I your
keys in the many things at my house when

716
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:20,750
the been before they left they had ever
meeting outside my house because none of

717
00:42:20,750 --> 00:42:21,460
the other

718
00:42:21,460 --> 00:42:26,580
CI cause them a problem when I when
exposed is highly classified program

719
00:42:26,580 --> 00:42:30,440
to all these agents who weren't cleared
day

720
00:42:30,440 --> 00:42:33,680
so they have a problem now

721
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:37,620
and the head to head agent was the only
one who was cleared

722
00:42:37,620 --> 00:42:40,799
now he you know he took an oath to
defend the Constitution to

723
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:44,280
but he wasn't living up to his old unite

724
00:42:44,280 --> 00:42:48,810
as I said before neither are any people
in congress were anybody in the

725
00:42:48,810 --> 00:42:49,860
administration

726
00:42:49,860 --> 00:42:56,860
they're all violating our constitutional
on so that's why I am

727
00:42:58,900 --> 00:43:02,680
that's why I am standing up and saying
these things because I

728
00:43:02,680 --> 00:43:06,470
you know I just can't let up as I mean
these people are basically cowards I

729
00:43:06,470 --> 00:43:09,380
mean this guy when I was explaining this
to all these other agent the only thing

730
00:43:09,380 --> 00:43:11,040
he could do was look at the floor

731
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:15,130
I mean I was watching how much the body
language really you know that

732
00:43:15,130 --> 00:43:18,850
I read more and buy a link is anything
also mmm

733
00:43:18,850 --> 00:43:22,290
so it was pretty clear to me that he was
shaved what he was doing but he was

734
00:43:22,290 --> 00:43:23,110
still doing it

735
00:43:23,110 --> 00:43:27,280
night on the Nurnberg you know defense
doesn't work

736
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:30,690
following orders is not a you know

737
00:43:30,690 --> 00:43:37,690
not acceptable so

738
00:43:39,330 --> 00:43:42,860
so then after that I decided well lemme

739
00:43:42,860 --> 00:43:45,940
I mean we lawyered-up right after that
rate so that

740
00:43:45,940 --> 00:43:49,600
in our lawyers are singing yet to be
quiet don't say anything you know

741
00:43:49,600 --> 00:43:51,460
they'll use it again used up like that

742
00:43:51,460 --> 00:43:56,220
you know you so he was really a strong
advocate for you as an ex-prosecutor so

743
00:43:56,220 --> 00:43:56,750
he was

744
00:43:56,750 --> 00:44:01,780
he was a year users a strong advocate as
saying nothing

745
00:44:01,780 --> 00:44:05,240
so that no didn't you didn't give

746
00:44:05,240 --> 00:44:09,380
in ammunition to the prosecution well
within any ammunition a given

747
00:44:09,380 --> 00:44:13,680
except the stuff I we talk about would
be things they have to drag me into

748
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:14,100
court

749
00:44:14,100 --> 00:44:18,910
the for and charge me with with the
exposing the crimes they were committing

750
00:44:18,910 --> 00:44:23,520
night so I thought there would be a good
idea let them do that

751
00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:27,860
Sony Radeon now is a

752
00:44:27,860 --> 00:44:33,900
up until 2010 than in 2010 they decided
that that well it renders with the

753
00:44:33,900 --> 00:44:37,880
they give made one last threat for
prosecution against us

754
00:44:37,880 --> 00:44:41,290
had to do with our turf Valley Club
meeting and

755
00:44:41,290 --> 00:44:46,110
in the 200 at the turf Valley Club Way
I'm we had all all the people who would

756
00:44:46,110 --> 00:44:46,630
they were

757
00:44:46,630 --> 00:44:52,100
interested in met when we were trying to
do was to address how to

758
00:44:52,100 --> 00:44:55,530
how do Sol and the in how to approach
the solution up

759
00:44:55,530 --> 00:44:58,970
Medicare Medicaid fraud arm

760
00:44:58,970 --> 00:45:02,410
and the FBI after their raid the rate is
surely a

761
00:45:02,410 --> 00:45:05,930
then and that was a and they had

762
00:45:05,930 --> 00:45:09,290
that what they gave them was all them I
mean course not they are we didn't have

763
00:45:09,290 --> 00:45:11,960
all the emails and everything was
sitting back and forth but

764
00:45:11,960 --> 00:45:15,420
he may we listen to the agenda we're
going to discuss

765
00:45:15,420 --> 00:45:19,650
and and operation paper and all that
which we took off the web by the way

766
00:45:19,650 --> 00:45:23,600
they call it a conspiracy paper was
taken directly up the website guess the

767
00:45:23,600 --> 00:45:25,120
web is a conspiracies

768
00:45:25,120 --> 00:45:29,920
the send her something at any rate turn

769
00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:33,320
im the

770
00:45:33,320 --> 00:45:38,150
they were planning on doing that and so
I

771
00:45:38,150 --> 00:45:40,870
in our lawyer told that they were
planning and guidance on that turf

772
00:45:40,870 --> 00:45:42,170
Valley Club meeting

773
00:45:42,170 --> 00:45:44,930
you know I think they had all the
evidence why are they doing it in

774
00:45:44,930 --> 00:45:47,930
Somerset malicious prosecution is the
charge

775
00:45:47,930 --> 00:45:51,069
okay so I figured this is when

776
00:45:51,070 --> 00:45:54,370
this is when I displaying its on
Democracy Now a

777
00:45:54,370 --> 00:45:57,770
yeah I said well note

778
00:45:57,770 --> 00:46:00,960
I know time Drake's phone is tapped okay

779
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:04,920
because he's been indicted already so

780
00:46:04,920 --> 00:46:07,970
I'm gonna call comment on all the
evidence that we have

781
00:46:07,970 --> 00:46:13,500
about the the malicious prosecution that
they're trying didn't get against us on

782
00:46:13,500 --> 00:46:17,230
this turf Valley Club being so I called
up to mama list all this stuff you know

783
00:46:17,230 --> 00:46:21,390
and I figured the FBI couldn't find the
data so I said well

784
00:46:21,390 --> 00:46:24,670
when you going to the file you know you
click on the file

785
00:46:24,670 --> 00:46:27,830
banana property 1809

786
00:46:27,830 --> 00:46:31,660
Anya so I and explain it over the phone
a Tom Tom Binns in the I think he

787
00:46:31,660 --> 00:46:34,180
understood what I was doing better

788
00:46:34,180 --> 00:46:39,410
so after that happened though we never
heard about that their family club again

789
00:46:39,410 --> 00:46:43,589
so then the doja decides they're going
of arrest letters have been unity

790
00:46:43,590 --> 00:46:46,710
that was occur we be in so

791
00:46:46,710 --> 00:46:51,450
the lower offers letters and immunity
under the condition that

792
00:46:51,450 --> 00:46:55,660
that we would be honest in telling
everything that we discussed it launches

793
00:46:55,660 --> 00:46:56,500
with

794
00:46:56,500 --> 00:47:00,260
with Tom Drake because we'll lunches
with Tom after he got traded to cuz we

795
00:47:00,260 --> 00:47:01,480
were friends you

796
00:47:01,480 --> 00:47:05,230
just because somebody gets raided by the
FBI only doesn't make them

797
00:47:05,230 --> 00:47:08,820
non-free and yumm so we were gonna
throng wages

798
00:47:08,820 --> 00:47:12,900
the country so

799
00:47:12,900 --> 00:47:17,710
so and our lawyer kept I mean I will
tell you what I told our lawyer

800
00:47:17,710 --> 00:47:22,390
he said they wanna talk to you in solo
give me letters above munity

801
00:47:22,390 --> 00:47:28,000
and I said you tell is best used to go
piss up a rope

802
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:31,970
and he said no here's a way to heat this
is you know he finally committee said

803
00:47:31,970 --> 00:47:35,420
well you know if you do this era of the
booking is all done with the name never

804
00:47:35,420 --> 00:47:36,890
come back and

805
00:47:36,890 --> 00:47:40,900
so I said okay so I couldn't pass up the
opportunity

806
00:47:40,900 --> 00:47:44,550
you know because when I went to meet
these guys

807
00:47:44,550 --> 00:47:49,190
one was the prosecutor well she was seen
prosecutor in the Stevenson M stevens

808
00:47:49,190 --> 00:47:51,040
case

809
00:47:51,040 --> 00:47:54,290
he's also the prosecutor in Times case
he was also

810
00:47:54,290 --> 00:47:58,270
he came in to take took over from
another prosecutor in

811
00:47:58,270 --> 00:48:02,900
am who was sending to indict is limited
her family's think so

812
00:48:02,900 --> 00:48:06,630
they were he was there in and FBI person
was there

813
00:48:06,630 --> 00:48:09,720
grumman enemy and who have

814
00:48:09,720 --> 00:48:13,910
he know he kinda he tried tried to stay
was with the FBI but I knew is from Q

815
00:48:13,910 --> 00:48:14,520
through

816
00:48:14,520 --> 00:48:17,690
keep 22 from NASA you know some

817
00:48:17,690 --> 00:48:22,080
an so the three of them were there in
and I started out saying

818
00:48:22,080 --> 00:48:26,600
you know because the I I wanted to make
it clear how I felt about them

819
00:48:26,600 --> 00:48:31,320
I said you people do not know how pissed
off at you I really AM

820
00:48:31,320 --> 00:48:35,020
you know in in you know and then we got
into asking questions I would answer

821
00:48:35,020 --> 00:48:37,550
their questions and I said and I got
into saying

822
00:48:37,550 --> 00:48:42,190
random things like you know I was really
irritated at all the laws in tennessee

823
00:48:42,190 --> 00:48:43,750
was breaking

824
00:48:43,750 --> 00:48:47,010
you know and and miss idiot

825
00:48:47,010 --> 00:48:50,290
on the in from q2 said what laws are
those

826
00:48:50,290 --> 00:48:53,940
well you know that was my opening you
know I

827
00:48:53,940 --> 00:48:57,950
II just I just had to lay the mall and

828
00:48:57,950 --> 00:49:01,630
I'm including the Constitution in all he
could do with the into that was look at

829
00:49:01,630 --> 00:49:05,010
the prosecutor and know that none of
them could say a word

830
00:49:05,010 --> 00:49:10,290
that's why say they're all cowards
sunlight is the solution to these things

831
00:49:10,290 --> 00:49:17,290
so that's why I'm trying to do that

832
00:49:23,059 --> 00:49:27,269
and to do that I ran into people like
jane mere at the new york Irvine

833
00:49:27,269 --> 00:49:30,650
Laura Poitras here in Tim Tam for din

834
00:49:30,650 --> 00:49:36,019
others who are trying to trying to help
her expose what's been going on here

835
00:49:36,019 --> 00:49:39,049
so like I say

836
00:49:39,049 --> 00:49:43,859
a.m. I think that turn president

837
00:49:43,859 --> 00:49:47,190
reagan had it right we r country with
the government

838
00:49:47,190 --> 00:49:51,319
not the reverse in I'd like to see it
stay that way

839
00:49:51,319 --> 00:49:58,319
thanks

840
00:50:02,839 --> 00:50:05,788
now now I'd like to take you into a bill
technology

841
00:50:05,789 --> 00:50:10,729
is the fun part be better you may be
interested in this I know you did

842
00:50:10,729 --> 00:50:14,239
and Emanuel slash eric has the copies

843
00:50:14,239 --> 00:50:17,479
if you want copies your welcome to the
modem

844
00:50:17,479 --> 00:50:22,749
so these were the today's approaches you
know

845
00:50:22,749 --> 00:50:27,159
and they would everybody we create their
own file so everybody have all kinda

846
00:50:27,159 --> 00:50:30,849
different files you know it time and
some would be real time someone wouldn't

847
00:50:30,849 --> 00:50:35,089
some you know and a

848
00:50:35,089 --> 00:50:40,328
in in many cases they would say well we
can ingest all this day okay so throw

849
00:50:40,329 --> 00:50:41,989
all that away will take in this

850
00:50:41,989 --> 00:50:45,400
they won't even look at just throw it
away so

851
00:50:45,400 --> 00:50:48,669
so NR our TD Ameritrade

852
00:50:48,669 --> 00:50:52,549
relational databases schemes problem
with relational databases schemes when

853
00:50:52,549 --> 00:50:52,929
you

854
00:50:52,929 --> 00:50:57,650
dealing at the terabyte per minute rates
where fiber-optic rates

855
00:50:57,650 --> 00:51:01,359
is it hard to index and keep up with the
rate

856
00:51:01,359 --> 00:51:05,380
comedian that's been it starts to back
up and fall apart

857
00:51:05,380 --> 00:51:10,630
so we went with absolute plantfiles: the
whole way this way we sought to do was

858
00:51:10,630 --> 00:51:13,890
be plus tree indexing flat file quick
index quick look up

859
00:51:13,890 --> 00:51:17,529
you know fast decision-making right away
so

860
00:51:17,529 --> 00:51:21,249
there was

861
00:51:21,249 --> 00:51:27,339
they get into that yeah

862
00:51:27,339 --> 00:51:30,569
their their content queries can be at

863
00:51:30,569 --> 00:51:35,150
the the point is we didn't you can look
at it like a Google Perry to do google

864
00:51:35,150 --> 00:51:36,199
para you'll get

865
00:51:36,199 --> 00:51:41,369
you know you can get millions returns
and there may be something in there that

866
00:51:41,369 --> 00:51:44,579
you want but you can't really tell so
that's not really a good query in that

867
00:51:44,579 --> 00:51:47,729
was really focusing on basically a
series of words or

868
00:51:47,729 --> 00:51:53,749
content skinny I'm or indexing their
form whereas we wanted to do

869
00:51:53,749 --> 00:51:56,890
we wanted to be looking at the data
without actually looking at the content

870
00:51:56,890 --> 00:51:58,368
we wanted to say that tillie

871
00:51:58,369 --> 00:52:02,079
and I will look at content at the very
end of our

872
00:52:02,079 --> 00:52:06,140
selection process so an exciting

873
00:52:06,140 --> 00:52:09,328
so we looked at the

874
00:52:09,329 --> 00:52:12,900
is the kind the requirements although
the release date them this way you know

875
00:52:12,900 --> 00:52:17,979
that's because it really the there if
they have a very difficult time

876
00:52:17,979 --> 00:52:22,739
expressing what the real requirements
are because you have to know what the

877
00:52:22,739 --> 00:52:24,169
problem is to do that

878
00:52:24,169 --> 00:52:30,969
me that's unfortunate WP you can read
through these and see that no

879
00:52:30,969 --> 00:52:35,359
you know so these are pretty
straightforward obviously Jim

880
00:52:35,359 --> 00:52:39,779
it's not not very complicated okay next
line

881
00:52:39,779 --> 00:52:44,630
so this gets into

882
00:52:44,630 --> 00:52:48,449
them automating analysis is really the
underlying theme here

883
00:52:48,449 --> 00:52:52,869
get making a system that smart enough to
be able to figure things out

884
00:52:52,869 --> 00:52:56,559
you know

885
00:52:56,559 --> 00:53:00,519
at the slides by the way about
twelve-years-old

886
00:53:00,519 --> 00:53:04,239
know it and i know im sorry not whether
it eight-years-old

887
00:53:04,239 --> 00:53:07,719
so you know this is not an

888
00:53:07,719 --> 00:53:12,140
occur well I haven't been at an essay
for ten years now have an ETA cleared

889
00:53:12,140 --> 00:53:15,900
since 2007 so we have been working
anywhere near any this stuff since then

890
00:53:15,900 --> 00:53:16,329
some

891
00:53:16,329 --> 00:53:21,109
but the problems have been changed as if
you read the latest

892
00:53:21,109 --> 00:53:26,909
to I'm White House Big Data initiative
they're asking for the same things right

893
00:53:26,909 --> 00:53:27,199
you

894
00:53:27,199 --> 00:53:30,619
but they don't see it that way ok in

895
00:53:30,619 --> 00:53:34,719
next slide this is a

896
00:53:34,719 --> 00:53:38,890
we use this all along this is right of
the web this was a picture on the web

897
00:53:38,890 --> 00:53:41,989
that someone made this up and who did it
but

898
00:53:41,989 --> 00:53:46,569
I'm this is basically a physical
connection not the

899
00:53:46,569 --> 00:53:50,709
what we call the logical connection
which is which is whose communicating

900
00:53:50,709 --> 00:53:51,969
across an hour these are the

901
00:53:51,969 --> 00:53:55,189
the physical fiber-optic lines
satellites

902
00:53:55,189 --> 00:53:59,989
wires things like that then all that
telecommunication transit sign

903
00:53:59,989 --> 00:54:04,109
but you can see them people died maybe
in

904
00:54:04,109 --> 00:54:09,219
10,000 computers or something you know
and how many but

905
00:54:09,219 --> 00:54:13,759
it's just a way of visualizing the
network but you can see choke points and

906
00:54:13,759 --> 00:54:14,959
things like that closer

907
00:54:14,959 --> 00:54:18,839
where you wanna go for ela grasping a
ball the data

908
00:54:18,839 --> 00:54:23,319
so next slide yes

909
00:54:23,319 --> 00:54:26,499
this is my favorite one they sent the
cap saying you know

910
00:54:26,499 --> 00:54:30,469
viable as the in Brian's what the use in
congress to get all the money

911
00:54:30,469 --> 00:54:33,669
is the real problem we can Hill is a
moron I said hey this is

912
00:54:33,669 --> 00:54:38,400
every year is positive you know Bonnie
get more vegetarian

913
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:42,739
blassie get a chance to try to get more
responsiveness of harlem

914
00:54:42,739 --> 00:54:45,999
why are we saying is the problem be well

915
00:54:45,999 --> 00:54:49,529
it was to get money you know and do the
feeding in

916
00:54:49,529 --> 00:54:54,469
continue the process in a circular I'm I
are retired come over your way you mean

917
00:54:54,469 --> 00:54:57,229
higher on the year something

918
00:54:57,229 --> 00:55:00,489
excellent so this is kinda the

919
00:55:00,489 --> 00:55:05,059
idea how are you put together in just
have data

920
00:55:05,059 --> 00:55:08,209
but the process really need to validate
that data in the beginning

921
00:55:08,209 --> 00:55:11,939
and the reason you need to do there's
like for Customs and Border Protection

922
00:55:11,939 --> 00:55:15,529
you have tens of thousand people writing
out all these forms worldwide in

923
00:55:15,529 --> 00:55:16,489
different you know they're

924
00:55:16,489 --> 00:55:20,400
they speak the primary language is
different language not English so

925
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:24,329
insular Philly on all these forms on
data in in in putting all the attributes

926
00:55:24,329 --> 00:55:25,829
the company's in

927
00:55:25,829 --> 00:55:30,130
and the things they wanna buy or sell
and then they send these forms in

928
00:55:30,130 --> 00:55:34,749
well they don't always spell that name
to the company's right or

929
00:55:34,749 --> 00:55:37,939
don't then you know might make
individual here on the phone number or

930
00:55:37,939 --> 00:55:40,219
the aggressor something

931
00:55:40,219 --> 00:55:44,260
I'm and so you have to go through a
process validating that data

932
00:55:44,260 --> 00:55:47,520
and and and correcting it so

933
00:55:47,520 --> 00:55:50,790
that you can then they saw follow-on
processing

934
00:55:50,790 --> 00:55:53,790
on solid data if you don't do it

935
00:55:53,790 --> 00:55:57,370
if you build on if you take in crappy
going to him garbage in there and it's

936
00:55:57,370 --> 00:55:59,799
your building on scene from that point
so

937
00:55:59,800 --> 00:56:05,120
so then we did event recognition things
we want to really in lies with the data

938
00:56:05,120 --> 00:56:08,799
in and Privacy Protection you wanna

939
00:56:08,800 --> 00:56:12,000
keepin on you uniquely encrypt things
that

940
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:16,320
any attribute data but the US citizen
for examples and no one could do

941
00:56:16,320 --> 00:56:20,980
doing good follow it from that point on
remember this is the initial acquisition

942
00:56:20,980 --> 00:56:23,780
of data points so from that point on
nobody

943
00:56:23,780 --> 00:56:27,260
can look at anything but an encrypted
version attribute to the US citizen

944
00:56:27,260 --> 00:56:32,510
can use a distributed story new index
the content against that because and

945
00:56:32,510 --> 00:56:33,540
you'll see it later

946
00:56:33,540 --> 00:56:37,250
when it comes up on the time lining ski
I'm

947
00:56:37,250 --> 00:56:41,370
all this is predicated on the enterprise
approach with says in the end you wanna

948
00:56:41,370 --> 00:56:44,779
produce intelligence from timelines and
grab some things like that

949
00:56:44,780 --> 00:56:48,600
so you have what you doing here has to
support that all the way through the

950
00:56:48,600 --> 00:56:49,400
enterprise

951
00:56:49,400 --> 00:56:53,660
and that's where that's where you get
them when you bring multi-discipline

952
00:56:53,660 --> 00:56:56,589
together that's where you get that
understanding you how one can help the

953
00:56:56,590 --> 00:56:57,130
other

954
00:56:57,130 --> 00:57:01,700
now what one breakthrough at one point
along the line can support the entire

955
00:57:01,700 --> 00:57:02,610
enterprise

956
00:57:02,610 --> 00:57:06,190
and then you get into

957
00:57:06,190 --> 00:57:09,880
building the graphs and this is where
you take

958
00:57:09,880 --> 00:57:13,610
relationships the ones you want track
and you do a p.m

959
00:57:13,610 --> 00:57:16,910
again this worries the people's tree am

960
00:57:16,910 --> 00:57:20,910
kind of approach you index aided me but
you also have the annex B Day

961
00:57:20,910 --> 00:57:25,549
to you double index basically because if
you're pulling on be you wanna get

962
00:57:25,550 --> 00:57:28,790
a few people in a unit be so I'm

963
00:57:28,790 --> 00:57:33,270
so then and then you keep frequent
economic times is seen at Link

964
00:57:33,270 --> 00:57:37,310
and in which direction and so on so
they're kinda thing tells you

965
00:57:37,310 --> 00:57:40,670
that's the building relationships crash

966
00:57:40,670 --> 00:57:44,320
and actually builds rather quickly if
you take a few billion put you get

967
00:57:44,320 --> 00:57:44,780
really

968
00:57:44,780 --> 00:57:49,670
big spike at the Grand adding lange's
after point start leveling off because

969
00:57:49,670 --> 00:57:50,090
you're

970
00:57:50,090 --> 00:57:53,510
collecting the same links over and over
again so

971
00:57:53,510 --> 00:57:57,320
as you build over time you you
reconstructed most if your social

972
00:57:57,320 --> 00:57:58,320
network sewing

973
00:57:58,320 --> 00:58:01,350
you know you know real until you and
somebody you social network

974
00:58:01,350 --> 00:58:05,720
the graph does not increase in size no
and then you go and look in

975
00:58:05,720 --> 00:58:10,480
other domains and other grants the New
Cross correlate those billions into a

976
00:58:10,480 --> 00:58:14,790
consolidated graph where now you have
and then you have to

977
00:58:14,790 --> 00:58:18,120
tables meant to be it's been two days so
that you know I'm

978
00:58:18,120 --> 00:58:22,710
and you don't use a person's name that's
the left first thing you do not use

979
00:58:22,710 --> 00:58:26,630
like they like they used to render some
people

980
00:58:26,630 --> 00:58:31,260
and you know is hard to believe that
they would do that they would use in a

981
00:58:31,260 --> 00:58:35,060
min smart that's the most unreliable and
tribute to the person

982
00:58:35,060 --> 00:58:40,860
is the knee I mean I would do a Google
on my name and I get about five or six

983
00:58:40,860 --> 00:58:41,650
William

984
00:58:41,650 --> 00:58:45,510
Edward bennies in the United States
alone now if you start

985
00:58:45,510 --> 00:58:48,600
Mohammed somebody how many those even
again

986
00:58:48,600 --> 00:58:51,850
well that's the most rely on reliable
inspect

987
00:58:51,850 --> 00:58:55,170
but they've done and done and

988
00:58:55,170 --> 00:59:00,100
it was just into the distance any so I
mean the reliable attributes earn

989
00:59:00,100 --> 00:59:04,070
phone numbers addresses passport number

990
00:59:04,070 --> 00:59:07,220
driver's license numbers things like
then

991
00:59:07,220 --> 00:59:10,480
those are the things you key in theory
liable attributes

992
00:59:10,480 --> 00:59:14,270
and then you start building the grass
with those next line

993
00:59:14,270 --> 00:59:21,270
yeah and so this is then

994
00:59:21,450 --> 00:59:25,170
and then you try to consolidate we had a
vision for government here

995
00:59:25,170 --> 00:59:28,650
so that this is this how you would
consolidate all the grants rule a

996
00:59:28,650 --> 00:59:29,820
government agencies

997
00:59:29,820 --> 00:59:33,520
and this was one we were going to use
with social security

998
00:59:33,520 --> 00:59:37,350
like who's dead who's alive night
medicare medicaid

999
00:59:37,350 --> 00:59:41,120
doctors hospitals

1000
00:59:41,120 --> 00:59:45,569
you know in labs and things like that an
end to a consolidated graphics approach

1001
00:59:45,570 --> 00:59:46,900
to try to discover

1002
00:59:46,900 --> 00:59:50,970
as they request payment the fraud

1003
00:59:50,970 --> 00:59:56,760
I'm and this is what the FBI in their
infinite wisdom stopped

1004
00:59:56,760 --> 00:59:59,800
so we still have it going

1005
00:59:59,800 --> 01:00:06,800
any rate next line

1006
01:00:07,090 --> 01:00:11,600
so in on a meeting in Alice's this was
our automate analysis process

1007
01:00:11,600 --> 01:00:15,410
we take care high integrity day that is

1008
01:00:15,410 --> 01:00:18,560
data that's either stored in bases
source

1009
01:00:18,560 --> 01:00:21,930
or a live streaming in and validated

1010
01:00:21,930 --> 01:00:25,660
so you have to do you have to validate a
high integrity otherwise you're building

1011
01:00:25,660 --> 01:00:26,370
on saint

1012
01:00:26,370 --> 01:00:31,279
so then the next the next thing is to
dudes

1013
01:00:31,280 --> 01:00:36,070
some kinda the event recognition within
that data that may be meaningful in a

1014
01:00:36,070 --> 01:00:37,270
given environment

1015
01:00:37,270 --> 01:00:40,550
okay so at that point you may be able to
say you alert to work

1016
01:00:40,550 --> 01:00:43,850
why don't you go look here you can get
other resources looking at the same

1017
01:00:43,850 --> 01:00:44,950
problem saying that

1018
01:00:44,950 --> 01:00:48,070
something like this might be happening
from this months ago look there and see

1019
01:00:48,070 --> 01:00:49,940
if you can define something that was
supported

1020
01:00:49,940 --> 01:00:54,100
and then after that you go up to and
through events

1021
01:00:54,100 --> 01:00:57,650
you you get into activity which is this
is where you build the graph

1022
01:00:57,650 --> 01:01:01,010
any bill the communities are the
relationships

1023
01:01:01,010 --> 01:01:05,350
up the entities in the events and then
you look at the community in see other

1024
01:01:05,350 --> 01:01:06,839
community is acting

1025
01:01:06,840 --> 01:01:10,890
and that gives you an activity and then
at that point you look and think well

1026
01:01:10,890 --> 01:01:14,180
at this point we get things like status
and disposition up with that

1027
01:01:14,180 --> 01:01:19,930
that communities doing okay and then at
that point then you go up to intentions

1028
01:01:19,930 --> 01:01:23,520
and capabilities it's next lobotomies
this probably the most difficult

1029
01:01:23,520 --> 01:01:26,830
level but the point is you can take past
history

1030
01:01:26,830 --> 01:01:30,230
and look at what they've done in the
past and say here's the criteria well

1031
01:01:30,230 --> 01:01:32,430
here's what they did specifically prior
to any

1032
01:01:32,430 --> 01:01:35,960
acted action that they took and you can
use their criteria

1033
01:01:35,960 --> 01:01:40,870
in activity recognition recognizes
certain activity process to do

1034
01:01:40,870 --> 01:01:41,700
inferencing

1035
01:01:41,700 --> 01:01:45,150
either they really could postulate
conditions you don't have to be

1036
01:01:45,150 --> 01:01:48,850
you know and Alana this information is
already in the data

1037
01:01:48,850 --> 01:01:52,140
you don't have to have knowledge about
it to begin with

1038
01:01:52,140 --> 01:01:55,870
you when you start working with the data
and you'll see this knowledge

1039
01:01:55,870 --> 01:02:01,460
inside that day the properties are
already there and nationalism that next

1040
01:02:01,460 --> 01:02:01,720
the

1041
01:02:01,720 --> 01:02:04,790
next slide please here's how some ovett

1042
01:02:04,790 --> 01:02:08,529
going this is like envision this is the
graph in this so

1043
01:02:08,530 --> 01:02:11,850
if if you think the blue is everything
else in the red as what you really

1044
01:02:11,850 --> 01:02:12,839
interested in

1045
01:02:12,840 --> 01:02:17,240
and as yellow is the zone proximity that
you might there's a high probability

1046
01:02:17,240 --> 01:02:18,220
among

1047
01:02:18,220 --> 01:02:22,120
or there's a high possibility they might
be associated with this is something you

1048
01:02:22,120 --> 01:02:24,440
really interested in so you want to look
at them closely

1049
01:02:24,440 --> 01:02:28,940
world in this then gives you the zone

1050
01:02:28,940 --> 01:02:32,540
to really focus in this is worried when
I use latent semantic indexing because

1051
01:02:32,540 --> 01:02:35,890
you reduce the problem to such a state
that now you're only comparing

1052
01:02:35,890 --> 01:02:41,049
data up things that are related or close
in close proximity to New

1053
01:02:41,050 --> 01:02:44,800
entity with the data out that entity see
now

1054
01:02:44,800 --> 01:02:49,510
online semantic indexing would work
because you reduced at the level so

1055
01:02:49,510 --> 01:02:53,680
probabilities accommodations go away and
the fact that they're so close

1056
01:02:53,680 --> 01:02:57,660
there's a high probability that words in
common will actually have the same

1057
01:02:57,660 --> 01:02:58,149
meeting

1058
01:02:58,150 --> 01:03:03,320
K and the rest love it you could take
over as the graph

1059
01:03:03,320 --> 01:03:07,520
that would cover me if you did the world
you would cover

1060
01:03:07,520 --> 01:03:10,890
you can see we cover in New York City
departed lower state New York you know

1061
01:03:10,890 --> 01:03:15,390
at that scale but but the ideas then

1062
01:03:15,390 --> 01:03:20,069
and here's where this nude Big Data
initiatives starts come in

1063
01:03:20,070 --> 01:03:23,250
they want to have what they really need
is some

1064
01:03:23,250 --> 01:03:27,640
this is my impression amid they might
have a program go through and

1065
01:03:27,640 --> 01:03:28,740
automatically figure on

1066
01:03:28,740 --> 01:03:32,800
new entities that they should consider
entities have interest

1067
01:03:32,800 --> 01:03:36,430
okay they wanna you wanna do

1068
01:03:36,430 --> 01:03:41,580
they want you to do automatic target
Development at that level right there

1069
01:03:41,580 --> 01:03:45,270
but also they want to go into the blue
mass out there

1070
01:03:45,270 --> 01:03:49,460
I'm in New York State New York City and
say

1071
01:03:49,460 --> 01:03:53,440
one out there should I also be looking
at nazar way to figure that out to new

1072
01:03:53,440 --> 01:03:56,100
ways of doing that but I never told them
about that

1073
01:03:56,100 --> 01:04:02,640
anyhow and Al to those who wait looking
at communities out there too

1074
01:04:02,640 --> 01:04:06,270
and that's what they're asking in this
big deal initially I mean

1075
01:04:06,270 --> 01:04:10,310
pentagon's gonna spend $250 million
million dollars a year on

1076
01:04:10,310 --> 01:04:13,950
and it's only the pentagon mean they've
got

1077
01:04:13,950 --> 01:04:17,350
other agencies listed here they're
spending money on it too but it's all

1078
01:04:17,350 --> 01:04:18,700
basically the same thing

1079
01:04:18,700 --> 01:04:22,500
now assesses basically analysis data is
data

1080
01:04:22,500 --> 01:04:26,030
me you know it's not not that different
from one easy to another

1081
01:04:26,030 --> 01:04:29,980
that's why we could take this entire
concept in and apply it to Medicare

1082
01:04:29,980 --> 01:04:33,050
Medicaid fraud

1083
01:04:33,050 --> 01:04:37,150
so am next line

1084
01:04:37,150 --> 01:04:41,710
also with the Big Data here's a here's
an example time lining

1085
01:04:41,710 --> 01:04:45,420
he doesn't have to be this is just the
way a picture in your time you could be

1086
01:04:45,420 --> 01:04:49,390
you can look at it any way you want you
can re reconfigure but these are the

1087
01:04:49,390 --> 01:04:51,339
attributes down the sign

1088
01:04:51,340 --> 01:04:55,630
activities graph to rate I'm dimension
which you can vary

1089
01:04:55,630 --> 01:04:58,650
and add and then what they want do is

1090
01:04:58,650 --> 01:05:03,140
okay I want you going down this time
line looking in activities in this

1091
01:05:03,140 --> 01:05:04,279
community

1092
01:05:04,280 --> 01:05:09,070
or any other community in saying heroes
here's a set of activities that looks

1093
01:05:09,070 --> 01:05:10,140
like

1094
01:05:10,140 --> 01:05:14,210
were set up for them combinations
relationships that are going on that

1095
01:05:14,210 --> 01:05:17,320
look like there's some activity

1096
01:05:17,320 --> 01:05:21,810
and and then actively might be terrorism
or something like that or anything else

1097
01:05:21,810 --> 01:05:24,009
and you need to figure that out I need a
non-american

1098
01:05:24,010 --> 01:05:28,050
must help me figure now and I need a
process also dynamic

1099
01:05:28,050 --> 01:05:31,390
automatically assess whether nitsa we
call it a profile

1100
01:05:31,390 --> 01:05:35,609
okay that's a profile about have a
community

1101
01:05:35,610 --> 01:05:39,830
and is it then a profile of the interest
that is there isn't now you getting into

1102
01:05:39,830 --> 01:05:41,920
intentions and capabilities

1103
01:05:41,920 --> 01:05:45,360
like for example if you're going to
smuggle drugs that the guy

1104
01:05:45,360 --> 01:05:49,260
I'm wanting to buy the drug test by the
call the guy to sell it you know they

1105
01:05:49,260 --> 01:05:50,250
gonna relate some

1106
01:05:50,250 --> 01:05:54,170
only after them set up the money
transaction at the setup transport all

1107
01:05:54,170 --> 01:05:55,520
those things have to happen

1108
01:05:55,520 --> 01:05:59,250
and they show up in relationships in the
community

1109
01:05:59,250 --> 01:06:02,900
and so you wanna be able to recognize
that kind combination and say okay

1110
01:06:02,900 --> 01:06:04,560
they're going to

1111
01:06:04,560 --> 01:06:08,340
smuggle drugs from this country to that
country were hooligans

1112
01:06:08,340 --> 01:06:13,050
smuggle guns from this one to them when
the same principle

1113
01:06:13,050 --> 01:06:16,740
so this really what they want that
they're not asking those questions a

1114
01:06:16,740 --> 01:06:19,780
but that's really what they need to do

1115
01:06:19,780 --> 01:06:23,400
that's really what they're after

1116
01:06:23,400 --> 01:06:28,160
so and in my mind this is the real
danger because now

1117
01:06:28,160 --> 01:06:33,110
unless the rules are correct there's a
lot of mistakes can be made here by them

1118
01:06:33,110 --> 01:06:37,440
nom in this and especially when they
pull it together bullies kinds of

1119
01:06:37,440 --> 01:06:38,870
activities were

1120
01:06:38,870 --> 01:06:42,140
this knowledge by the way is
automatically

1121
01:06:42,140 --> 01:06:46,020
generated it's sitting there so

1122
01:06:46,020 --> 01:06:49,200
it only pops up if they ask for it

1123
01:06:49,200 --> 01:06:53,760
okay so if you ask for this time-line
you get it

1124
01:06:53,760 --> 01:07:00,190
you can get it on anyone because the
data already exists there

1125
01:07:00,190 --> 01:07:03,620
and this is the problem that I see that

1126
01:07:03,620 --> 01:07:08,950
is the threat this is what this is what
the stars see the KTB

1127
01:07:08,950 --> 01:07:13,140
and gestapo were after this was there
and knowledge in

1128
01:07:13,140 --> 01:07:16,190
the population

1129
01:07:16,190 --> 01:07:20,960
and this is the real danger
unfortunately it's also the real hey to

1130
01:07:20,960 --> 01:07:21,680
Sol

1131
01:07:21,680 --> 01:07:26,230
nasty problems and and get bad guys and
fortunately

1132
01:07:26,230 --> 01:07:30,090
is the same in both cases and there's a
threat

1133
01:07:30,090 --> 01:07:33,290
and it and unfortunately our government
is

1134
01:07:33,290 --> 01:07:40,290
as dick cheney which the moving to the
dark side

1135
01:07:40,290 --> 01:07:44,850
an eerie this is the technology I
thought I'd try to

1136
01:07:44,850 --> 01:07:47,910
pass on to you and see if you

1137
01:07:47,910 --> 01:07:54,910
enjoyed it anyway

1138
01:08:01,020 --> 01:08:02,490
you

1139
01:08:02,490 --> 01:08:05,820
missed I guess we could take questions
now p.m. if you have any questions i

1140
01:08:05,820 --> 01:08:07,060
mean

1141
01:08:07,060 --> 01:08:12,259
there's a microphone here in

1142
01:08:12,260 --> 01:08:16,870
trees 15 min to questions

1143
01:08:16,870 --> 01:08:23,479
okay alright K to my gun

1144
01:08:23,480 --> 01:08:28,630
no okay hearing

1145
01:08:28,630 --> 01:08:32,259
pool so

1146
01:08:32,259 --> 01:08:35,779
no I would a system like this respond to

1147
01:08:35,779 --> 01:08:40,890
more and more decentralized standard
interconnection

1148
01:08:40,890 --> 01:08:44,009
everybody the I wanted

1149
01:08:44,009 --> 01:08:48,238
your decentralized you mean i missin you
know mesh networks

1150
01:08:48,239 --> 01:08:52,239
well this is already setup yeah I think
that this is already setup to

1151
01:08:52,239 --> 01:08:54,900
reconstruct mother a network is there so
it's not a

1152
01:08:54,900 --> 01:08:58,900
the question of a structure I'll get
into

1153
01:08:58,900 --> 01:09:02,339
the planet direct connections that
altered

1154
01:09:02,339 --> 01:09:05,738
happens were ans

1155
01:09:05,739 --> 01:09:10,130
number I'm not quite sure I can answer
that for you

1156
01:09:10,130 --> 01:09:13,759
maybe couldn't to the tell me learn more
about our plan only be able in a

1157
01:09:13,759 --> 01:09:17,238
answer that for you but like like for
example

1158
01:09:17,239 --> 01:09:20,200
right now I try to explain the Tor
network but they were the read the way

1159
01:09:20,200 --> 01:09:21,809
they were attacked the tour network is

1160
01:09:21,810 --> 01:09:25,859
to monitor large segment of the network
in and look at the

1161
01:09:25,859 --> 01:09:29,029
streams a bits dreams passing from

1162
01:09:29,029 --> 01:09:32,620
ground loop and do a time a time

1163
01:09:32,620 --> 01:09:36,988
on collapse a common bit streams so then
you could see

1164
01:09:36,989 --> 01:09:41,339
potentially bit strained moving from one
segment to another in time sequence

1165
01:09:41,339 --> 01:09:45,880
and even predict the link you're missing
and things like that so that's

1166
01:09:45,880 --> 01:09:49,719
that's way I would envision attacking
them so

1167
01:09:49,719 --> 01:09:53,370
him and then there's a lot of other
things to do after that

1168
01:09:53,370 --> 01:09:58,890
day many many thanks for excellent

1169
01:09:58,890 --> 01:10:04,050
credible presentation everything you've
done thank you are in February 2011

1170
01:10:04,050 --> 01:10:07,420
eight-member activists associated with
anonymous

1171
01:10:07,420 --> 01:10:10,650
cracked into intelligence contractor HD

1172
01:10:10,650 --> 01:10:15,910
Gary servers and among the things they
found PowerPoint presentations

1173
01:10:15,910 --> 01:10:19,480
describing how HD eerie I

1174
01:10:19,480 --> 01:10:23,010
along with other intelligence
contractors are Palin tear

1175
01:10:23,010 --> 01:10:27,590
proposed to silence progressive voices
like Glenn Greenwald's

1176
01:10:27,590 --> 01:10:31,530
not Hong Kong in critics bankamerica

1177
01:10:31,530 --> 01:10:34,840
critics and the Chamber of Commerce to
requesting

1178
01:10:34,840 --> 01:10:38,590
first how does American defendants
purcell

1179
01:10:38,590 --> 01:10:43,210
against remove national security
contractors

1180
01:10:43,210 --> 01:10:47,100
and second as a 'em finance on the bank
possible are

1181
01:10:47,100 --> 01:10:51,090
him my telephone and e-mail are being
the little be disrupted

1182
01:10:51,090 --> 01:10:54,280
disrupted and hacked however since I
talked

1183
01:10:54,280 --> 01:10:59,110
Securities Exchange Commission so local
police won't help you

1184
01:10:59,110 --> 01:11:03,059
the FBI will help you where'd you go
your company

1185
01:11:03,060 --> 01:11:08,760
st you know I'm by putting a copy serve
everything I do

1186
01:11:08,760 --> 01:11:12,219
right so but they're not they're not
disrupting my

1187
01:11:12,219 --> 01:11:15,280
ability to communicate that still has a
little bit different on

1188
01:11:15,280 --> 01:11:19,070
I monitoring rice she run

1189
01:11:19,070 --> 01:11:23,710
that a little like they disrupted my
life when they send people with guns at

1190
01:11:23,710 --> 01:11:24,810
the neck Acer

1191
01:11:24,810 --> 01:11:29,300
but but they are disrupting my

1192
01:11:29,300 --> 01:11:33,120
ability I guess they wanna watch what I
say inside I keep trying to tell them

1193
01:11:33,120 --> 01:11:35,200
exactly what I think that them

1194
01:11:35,200 --> 01:11:39,929
time South but I'm not sure I don't know

1195
01:11:39,930 --> 01:11:43,600
hand don't know what to tell you to do
their wouldn't

1196
01:11:43,600 --> 01:11:46,730
American and purcell and these contacts

1197
01:11:46,730 --> 01:11:50,180
no see the the as I and

1198
01:11:50,180 --> 01:11:54,020
I said I said there's a delay the other
would not last month and

1199
01:11:54,020 --> 01:11:57,080
the only thing I could think that we
could start doing is

1200
01:11:57,080 --> 01:12:00,500
replacing everybody comes in getting
launched past the reeling

1201
01:12:00,500 --> 01:12:04,440
I mean I'm I'm an advocate for term
limits

1202
01:12:04,440 --> 01:12:07,870
I term limits the only way I mean

1203
01:12:07,870 --> 01:12:10,870
otherwise I would if the police aren't
helping you

1204
01:12:10,870 --> 01:12:14,269
'em which is supposed to do course it's
somebody you know

1205
01:12:14,270 --> 01:12:17,790
I'm I would go by sums

1206
01:12:17,790 --> 01:12:21,450
it simple things like by by throw away
phones

1207
01:12:21,450 --> 01:12:24,550
and and keep buying doesn't help people

1208
01:12:24,550 --> 01:12:28,280
I I think in touch with you I great very
high

1209
01:12:28,280 --> 01:12:31,889
I miss him but you have to have some way
to tell 'em right right

1210
01:12:31,890 --> 01:12:36,460
I said the most secure ways to buy two
phones get one your friend you take one

1211
01:12:36,460 --> 01:12:39,950
and then you'll use it you show up as a
graph is a link

1212
01:12:39,950 --> 01:12:43,380
I saw a link in no 10 will not be
connected anywhere so

1213
01:12:43,380 --> 01:12:47,790
yes but if you can people to get in
touch with you no i i understand the

1214
01:12:47,790 --> 01:12:49,610
problem I but I just don't know what to
tell you

1215
01:12:49,610 --> 01:12:52,900
on

1216
01:12:52,900 --> 01:12:55,910
our this is actually a bit 10 gentle but
on

1217
01:12:55,910 --> 01:12:59,239
when you're talking about some the ways
you have to look at

1218
01:12:59,239 --> 01:13:02,540
the day in San problems you had you're
talking about how

1219
01:13:02,540 --> 01:13:06,890
Google's take search terms when work
because I've been accuracies because

1220
01:13:06,890 --> 01:13:09,969
ways things it's spelled differently
could use

1221
01:13:09,969 --> 01:13:12,980
me to develops to create a more humane
searching

1222
01:13:12,980 --> 01:13:18,880
just the open yes effect reproach Google
for doing them

1223
01:13:18,880 --> 01:13:22,540
but they said no we do really well
ourselves

1224
01:13:22,540 --> 01:13:25,590
okay thank you

1225
01:13:25,590 --> 01:13:32,590
were actually we put we approached
Google in 2003

1226
01:13:33,350 --> 01:13:37,460
are there was a year the New Yorker
article few months ago about this

1227
01:13:37,460 --> 01:13:40,530
nom are i won up the sides

1228
01:13:40,530 --> 01:13:44,639
from if you're talking day all what is
there in the public

1229
01:13:44,640 --> 01:13:49,320
Artspace we could use to follow up
practically on

1230
01:13:49,320 --> 01:13:52,690
you know are lives parallel system all
sorts of

1231
01:13:52,690 --> 01:13:56,800
data all am

1232
01:13:56,800 --> 01:14:00,770
see a lotta Alana companies when I get
this they keep that they keep these

1233
01:14:00,770 --> 01:14:01,860
things is a

1234
01:14:01,860 --> 01:14:06,239
intellectual capital and and going to
share it

1235
01:14:06,239 --> 01:14:10,430
and that's true also the government so
lot of times they won't tell you these

1236
01:14:10,430 --> 01:14:12,330
kinds of things like I never

1237
01:14:12,330 --> 01:14:16,050
I never documented how to do anything I
need because I didn't want the

1238
01:14:16,050 --> 01:14:17,540
government to know it

1239
01:14:17,540 --> 01:14:21,920
stuff I would put out what to do this is
what to do here you know so

1240
01:14:21,920 --> 01:14:25,520
they could easily but but it's very I
guess said

1241
01:14:25,520 --> 01:14:29,140
the company's feel that they lose or in
I'm

1242
01:14:29,140 --> 01:14:32,460
I guess university is the only
free-flowing

1243
01:14:32,460 --> 01:14:36,120
the place to get knowledge like that I
mean there they they they re

1244
01:14:36,120 --> 01:14:40,469
they tend to say you have to share know
where his government and companies don't

1245
01:14:40,469 --> 01:14:41,590
so

1246
01:14:41,590 --> 01:14:45,600
I'm not quite sure where it but to tell
you where to look there so

1247
01:14:45,600 --> 01:14:48,860
I mean I go around the web looking all
the time just with technical term just

1248
01:14:48,860 --> 01:14:52,580
seein and look at most of its
advertising you known

1249
01:14:52,580 --> 01:14:56,730
nothing really technical so they're
trying to keep their

1250
01:14:56,730 --> 01:15:00,320
the RAM secrets whatever they're doing

1251
01:15:00,320 --> 01:15:04,170
to themselves the specific seven anyway
II your Google

1252
01:15:04,170 --> 01:15:09,000
thin thread paper them on my who have
nothing to do with

1253
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:12,380
right that's right that's the other
francis Taylor prom ride

1254
01:15:12,380 --> 01:15:16,620
with the the word doesn't necessarily
you have to do combination things like

1255
01:15:16,620 --> 01:15:17,230
that

1256
01:15:17,230 --> 01:15:21,730
NSA thin thread you know 'em

1257
01:15:21,730 --> 01:15:25,410
actually you still won't find much there
to him stop

1258
01:15:25,410 --> 01:15:29,210
you will find that redacted DOD I G
report

1259
01:15:29,210 --> 01:15:32,680
which is like 90 ninety-seven percent
read acted

1260
01:15:32,680 --> 01:15:36,080
the only thing they left in was the DOD
I G sir

1261
01:15:36,080 --> 01:15:39,680
assessment a thin trade as it doesn't
really have enough documentation for the

1262
01:15:39,680 --> 01:15:41,820
operators

1263
01:15:41,820 --> 01:15:47,040
well see the home that the I thought
that was pretty funny myself

1264
01:15:47,040 --> 01:15:51,530
is eerily didn't quite understand what
they were looking at because

1265
01:15:51,530 --> 01:15:55,580
there was a fully automated remotely
controlled system

1266
01:15:55,580 --> 01:15:58,890
it had zero operates on the front and

1267
01:15:58,890 --> 01:16:03,020
the only thing we provided was a
hardware diagrams up hardware broker

1268
01:16:03,020 --> 01:16:05,650
were out they could replace it

1269
01:16:05,650 --> 01:16:09,370
so miss I but there was funny but they
left all that kind stuff in there

1270
01:16:09,370 --> 01:16:16,370
in that report if you look at it yes

1271
01:16:19,130 --> 01:16:22,720
you thank you for a great saw

1272
01:16:22,720 --> 01:16:27,410
on thinking during no how you classify
your security status

1273
01:16:27,410 --> 01:16:30,610
better moment for one thing well my
security I

1274
01:16:30,610 --> 01:16:37,610
I don't I don't really care okay I guess
my next question is what prevents this

1275
01:16:38,730 --> 01:16:39,620
from

1276
01:16:39,620 --> 01:16:43,050
breaking into the public sphere more
like obviously have been entirely

1277
01:16:43,050 --> 01:16:45,970
sensible you're speaking %uh see you in
democracy right now

1278
01:16:45,970 --> 01:16:50,500
right what stops them from being a press
conference with you and other people

1279
01:16:50,500 --> 01:16:54,790
you mentions nothing it and in fact I'm
I volunteer for all of them

1280
01:16:54,790 --> 01:17:00,290
right so but I mean I mean technically
woodstock socially would have happened

1281
01:17:00,290 --> 01:17:01,010
socially

1282
01:17:01,010 --> 01:17:04,550
my I can be my impressionable a socially
I think

1283
01:17:04,550 --> 01:17:08,250
I think there's a lot of press that is
afraid at this issue

1284
01:17:08,250 --> 01:17:13,300
national security is kinda a taboo issue
for them

1285
01:17:13,300 --> 01:17:17,250
they can't discuss it when in fact that
to my mind

1286
01:17:17,250 --> 01:17:20,890
that's the most important thing we need
to discuss right now were one of them

1287
01:17:20,890 --> 01:17:21,510
anyway

1288
01:17:21,510 --> 01:17:28,510
in have

1289
01:17:31,150 --> 01:17:35,790
to to questions one is related with the
woman said about you know securing your

1290
01:17:35,790 --> 01:17:36,710
own communications

1291
01:17:36,710 --> 01:17:40,830
yellow get some disposable phones but it
but in the day a mass information what's

1292
01:17:40,830 --> 01:17:42,769
to stop staples themselves that

1293
01:17:42,770 --> 01:17:47,530
tracfone which is called from watchin
you as you go I'll

1294
01:17:47,530 --> 01:17:51,830
yeah see if you pay with cash yeah your
receipt you know taking a picture your

1295
01:17:51,830 --> 01:17:52,610
photo ID

1296
01:17:52,610 --> 01:17:56,230
how's it to how would any of that really
secure that was a question came up just

1297
01:17:56,230 --> 01:17:58,670
when she asked but well I mean

1298
01:17:58,670 --> 01:18:03,239
the point is you don't have to give your
name when you buy the phone right what

1299
01:18:03,239 --> 01:18:06,460
i'm saying is it with with with
information you know that I'm I've heard

1300
01:18:06,460 --> 01:18:09,440
like face recognition stuff going on
with Facebook now everything

1301
01:18:09,440 --> 01:18:12,610
okay but see at the hide within the
crowd

1302
01:18:12,610 --> 01:18:16,070
writer what's the random probability the
mansion

1303
01:18:16,070 --> 01:18:19,969
where actually am in I mean they could
have a picture view but

1304
01:18:19,970 --> 01:18:24,300
so what unless they can match it to name
the place in who you are and what you

1305
01:18:24,300 --> 01:18:24,850
doing

1306
01:18:24,850 --> 01:18:28,760
right I mean that still that still
private them

1307
01:18:28,760 --> 01:18:34,050
well two more questions ones for sure to
what degree do you think I didn't hear

1308
01:18:34,050 --> 01:18:35,489
it wasn't sure if you answered before

1309
01:18:35,489 --> 01:18:38,890
the Tor browser is secure just bar

1310
01:18:38,890 --> 01:18:42,920
all I did was give my my approach
attacking how I will attack it as

1311
01:18:42,920 --> 01:18:46,460
actually I think it could be created
creates work

1312
01:18:46,460 --> 01:18:50,870
I mean it's a minute to put in the work
to figure it out some to actually

1313
01:18:50,870 --> 01:18:54,930
that's not a bit its nest on the bed
point the point is if

1314
01:18:54,930 --> 01:18:59,530
to disrupt this kind of activity is you
making work for them especially by the

1315
01:18:59,530 --> 01:19:00,250
people

1316
01:19:00,250 --> 01:19:03,880
is is her cousin leigh a lot of problems

1317
01:19:03,880 --> 01:19:09,430
okay so in other words if you

1318
01:19:09,430 --> 01:19:13,570
it does say a cousin lot prouder people
have to work that out

1319
01:19:13,570 --> 01:19:16,969
I mean if the machine can work it out
with you if you have a cipher in the

1320
01:19:16,969 --> 01:19:18,390
machine can break the code

1321
01:19:18,390 --> 01:19:22,900
me that's not a lot of work for them but
if you people few isolated a couple

1322
01:19:22,900 --> 01:19:23,300
people

1323
01:19:23,300 --> 01:19:26,840
he is they're using foods right there

1324
01:19:26,840 --> 01:19:30,350
you substitute nouns for nouns verbs for
words and so on

1325
01:19:30,350 --> 01:19:33,900
to you the constructor the words that
you would put together

1326
01:19:33,900 --> 01:19:37,820
with wood the with them read like
anything else

1327
01:19:37,820 --> 01:19:41,160
and and be logical Ryan position wise

1328
01:19:41,160 --> 01:19:45,200
but it wouldn't turn it wouldn't have it
wouldn't have the meaning

1329
01:19:45,200 --> 01:19:49,000
that they were reading okay they be
reading this so what does that mean

1330
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:49,920
somebody

1331
01:19:49,920 --> 01:19:54,120
a person has to look at it and now
they're going to take time out in

1332
01:19:54,120 --> 01:19:57,630
so fly people started doing that and you
know that would

1333
01:19:57,630 --> 01:20:01,520
that would surely you make a lot of work
for them so what are the other things

1334
01:20:01,520 --> 01:20:02,320
certain

1335
01:20:02,320 --> 01:20:05,330
I think I was making it came up with the

1336
01:20:05,330 --> 01:20:08,400
Jacob Appelbaum a two-run to our project

1337
01:20:08,400 --> 01:20:13,010
one of the questions was where all these
other sites in the network

1338
01:20:13,010 --> 01:20:16,250
and and a I'm I was

1339
01:20:16,250 --> 01:20:20,460
I I suggest I did not play sell it then
take it or not but

1340
01:20:20,460 --> 01:20:24,080
I would suggest someone think you could
do is if you're distributed around the

1341
01:20:24,080 --> 01:20:24,690
country

1342
01:20:24,690 --> 01:20:29,210
is just do trace trace route so knowing
things that you're sending to one

1343
01:20:29,210 --> 01:20:29,690
another

1344
01:20:29,690 --> 01:20:33,340
and lay the links ladling sound

1345
01:20:33,340 --> 01:20:37,469
that didn't go across the trace and
overlap them is like a multi-dimensional

1346
01:20:37,469 --> 01:20:39,340
scaling approach on

1347
01:20:39,340 --> 01:20:44,600
although linking then that should
reconstruct the inside the United States

1348
01:20:44,600 --> 01:20:45,340
the network

1349
01:20:45,340 --> 01:20:48,570
and then you could look at that as a

1350
01:20:48,570 --> 01:20:52,509
scaling the issue and try to lay it on a
map at the United States

1351
01:20:52,510 --> 01:20:56,590
see mine and I will give you the

1352
01:20:56,590 --> 01:21:00,560
lines inside the united states and look
at the intersecting pointed to hear that

1353
01:21:00,560 --> 01:21:03,570
converging point a lot lines and so
therefore that a

1354
01:21:03,570 --> 01:21:07,150
high probability site the tap

1355
01:21:07,150 --> 01:21:12,469
day so that the and by the way I did the
I did for IFFI did

1356
01:21:12,469 --> 01:21:15,610
did some numbering scheme I didn't tell
miss but I didn't sign in my affidavit

1357
01:21:15,610 --> 01:21:17,049
but so it's not

1358
01:21:17,050 --> 01:21:21,150
there but I did have some further
calculations on the

1359
01:21:21,150 --> 01:21:25,830
storage site in new type of deal if you
look at a hundred thousand square feet

1360
01:21:25,830 --> 01:21:26,960
there

1361
01:21:26,960 --> 01:21:30,930
storage space that's other million
square feet at 600,000 square points can

1362
01:21:30,930 --> 01:21:32,500
be storage

1363
01:21:32,500 --> 01:21:37,290
if you look at it and said lo que with
today's technology like getting

1364
01:21:37,290 --> 01:21:41,790
climber safe dot com has it I think the
cell

1365
01:21:41,790 --> 01:21:47,440
the 10 exabyte storage capacity that
will occupy 21 racks in like two hundred

1366
01:21:47,440 --> 01:21:49,850
square feet

1367
01:21:49,850 --> 01:21:54,030
so a 10 exabytes RBI 200 square feet
100000 speak issue

1368
01:21:54,030 --> 01:21:58,500
5,000 exabytes are 50 bytes okay

1369
01:21:58,500 --> 01:22:02,180
now I did some calculations at ten
cubits the second of the

1370
01:22:02,180 --> 01:22:05,400
marriage to bite production what would
it take

1371
01:22:05,400 --> 01:22:10,230
I mean there's devices would it take to
maintain 100% at the last 100 years at

1372
01:22:10,230 --> 01:22:13,830
data online or the latest one hundred
have been lookin

1373
01:22:13,830 --> 01:22:18,239
how many nurse devices will it take to
sustain that storage

1374
01:22:18,239 --> 01:22:23,770
and turns out for processing would take
about 1,250 nearest devices

1375
01:22:23,770 --> 01:22:27,900
running for processing all the time to
sustain a hundred years ago

1376
01:22:27,900 --> 01:22:31,840
data on that system

1377
01:22:31,840 --> 01:22:35,739
so but then nearest doesn't another
networks work that way so it's probably

1378
01:22:35,739 --> 01:22:37,260
somewhere between

1379
01:22:37,260 --> 01:22:42,460
to OMA up to twice that number that they
would need to do them

1380
01:22:42,460 --> 01:22:47,380
so but that's with the even with today's
9 storage capacity

1381
01:22:47,380 --> 01:22:53,180
I mean so down the road it's only going
to get much higher some

1382
01:22:53,180 --> 01:22:56,210
okay last question is to what degree do
you think there are people

1383
01:22:56,210 --> 01:23:00,660
involved in higher levels in Venice CA
the CIA whatever that are sympathetic

1384
01:23:00,660 --> 01:23:04,180
to to to the average person's cause im

1385
01:23:04,180 --> 01:23:07,400
privacy and to what degree do you think
we have we are moving towards the dark

1386
01:23:07,400 --> 01:23:10,239
side where these people are kinda
consume themselves or

1387
01:23:10,239 --> 01:23:13,440
you know legend in their own minds is
whether it's written

1388
01:23:13,440 --> 01:23:17,170
the other arrogance is a the higher you
go the higher the americans love all

1389
01:23:17,170 --> 01:23:20,540
Americans

1390
01:23:20,540 --> 01:23:23,850
and I'll stupid and

1391
01:23:23,850 --> 01:23:26,960
yeah 9

1392
01:23:26,960 --> 01:23:31,270
great yeah makes

1393
01:23:31,270 --> 01:23:34,380
thank you very much for only I'm home

1394
01:23:34,380 --> 01:23:37,760
I it's funny I that since and
surveillance in my life and I often

1395
01:23:37,760 --> 01:23:38,810
think I don't mind

1396
01:23:38,810 --> 01:23:42,340
then hearing me if they thought they
would listen to me

1397
01:23:42,340 --> 01:23:45,850
methods

1398
01:23:45,850 --> 01:23:50,370
receptions different issue here
comprehensive yeah

1399
01:23:50,370 --> 01:23:53,860
meet you tonight about like the solution
to this problem the NWO

1400
01:23:53,860 --> 01:23:57,489
the bastards am which you know where the
inode

1401
01:23:57,489 --> 01:24:00,550
the most gerrymandered represented now
to see in the world

1402
01:24:00,550 --> 01:24:04,400
obviously I think there's just no two
ways about the fact that that's not

1403
01:24:04,400 --> 01:24:05,270
going to work

1404
01:24:05,270 --> 01:24:09,070
okay and something happen your
unfortunately you

1405
01:24:09,070 --> 01:24:12,690
cell I'm into being on on a Burgess haha

1406
01:24:12,690 --> 01:24:16,560
areas in summer stock between an
impossible I for a situation and what

1407
01:24:16,560 --> 01:24:18,790
because the Virgin totalitarianism

1408
01:24:18,790 --> 01:24:24,030
when your mind is flips over that Virgin
wouldn't look like what is life

1409
01:24:24,030 --> 01:24:27,050
Mike after all this is the searchers put
it to the point

1410
01:24:27,050 --> 01:24:31,820
control are I don't know about you but
the

1411
01:24:31,820 --> 01:24:36,400
it looks like to me east germany where
the Weimar Republic

1412
01:24:36,400 --> 01:24:39,940
just before I mean I think that we're in
that state now where

1413
01:24:39,940 --> 01:24:43,070
no is some people don't start because
they didn't speak up in the Weimar

1414
01:24:43,070 --> 01:24:45,290
Republic look what they got

1415
01:24:45,290 --> 01:24:49,820
so mean was then glowing I'll probably
be four your time that I was

1416
01:24:49,820 --> 01:24:53,630
that was when Hitler came to rise in the
east in Germany stern

1417
01:24:53,630 --> 01:24:56,850
because nobody spoke up you know

1418
01:24:56,850 --> 01:25:01,300
nobody posted that happened know we're
in an environment where the one of the

1419
01:25:01,300 --> 01:25:04,820
great lessons media lessons and that
Bush administration's that if everyone

1420
01:25:04,820 --> 01:25:05,920
speaks out

1421
01:25:05,920 --> 01:25:09,030
and you just ignore them nothing happens

1422
01:25:09,030 --> 01:25:12,120
and as I'm I you know me I am person and
in the media

1423
01:25:12,120 --> 01:25:16,040
I'm I might I would like it if telling
stories change things but I yeah

1424
01:25:16,040 --> 01:25:19,390
right now than it does actually a the

1425
01:25:19,390 --> 01:25:23,260
the includes does occur when the when
large numbers of people to call in two

1426
01:25:23,260 --> 01:25:25,440
representatives House and Senate

1427
01:25:25,440 --> 01:25:29,310
and you can put pressure on that Wayne
the White House can maybe

1428
01:25:29,310 --> 01:25:34,030
ignore you but the house and senate
there and they're like closer in the

1429
01:25:34,030 --> 01:25:37,500
the ever a higher fear factor

1430
01:25:37,500 --> 01:25:41,290
European voted out I'm hype I believe
they'd

1431
01:25:41,290 --> 01:25:44,410
I believe in limits I mean that way they
don't become

1432
01:25:44,410 --> 01:25:48,960
sedimentary kinda people there that
their perpetually there

1433
01:25:48,960 --> 01:25:52,969
and they tend to begin to think that
their vision of what should happen is

1434
01:25:52,969 --> 01:25:57,900
is obviously the right one they than
other words they grow up their own minds

1435
01:25:57,900 --> 01:26:01,570
after a while so essentially you're
saying that the best according to

1436
01:26:01,570 --> 01:26:04,099
monetary easing is probably with you its
blackout

1437
01:26:04,100 --> 01:26:07,530
I don't think I don't think it would be
a blackout I think girl exposing

1438
01:26:07,530 --> 01:26:11,059
anything in any way you can expose it is
the best way

1439
01:26:11,060 --> 01:26:15,670
right

1440
01:26:15,670 --> 01:26:18,690
you started by pointing out that the

1441
01:26:18,690 --> 01:26:22,100
National Intelligence Agency's work
providing operational intelligence to

1442
01:26:22,100 --> 01:26:23,640
the operators or anything

1443
01:26:23,640 --> 01:26:27,100
and then expanded to

1444
01:26:27,100 --> 01:26:31,330
the programs expanded beyond any the
constitutional controls

1445
01:26:31,330 --> 01:26:34,980
and any reasonable limits on what to do
others related in some way with

1446
01:26:34,980 --> 01:26:36,700
devolving power from

1447
01:26:36,700 --> 01:26:39,969
national agencies down to the services
forces smaller

1448
01:26:39,969 --> 01:26:43,600
entities be able to I think I think the
theme there is sharing

1449
01:26:43,600 --> 01:26:46,870
and sharing is the issue they have they
have a problem sharing

1450
01:26:46,870 --> 01:26:51,760
knowledge and also sharing information
and making things known to the public or

1451
01:26:51,760 --> 01:26:53,410
anybody

1452
01:26:53,410 --> 01:26:57,309
sharing is the I think the common
problem crossing that

1453
01:26:57,310 --> 01:27:01,860
both internally and yes yeah

1454
01:27:01,860 --> 01:27:05,120
okay alright okay

1455
01:27:05,120 --> 01:27:12,120
thank you

1456
01:27:25,210 --> 01:27:31,000
to get there

1457
01:27:31,000 --> 01:27:31,369
check check
