1
00:00:00,020 --> 00:00:04,630
idly up variously I work on SSL
networking stuff on Google Chrome

2
00:00:04,630 --> 00:00:08,550
I'm mostly the engineer behind vehicles
HEVs serving

3
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:11,960
and if I had the slides today

4
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:15,009
profoundly I don't I will have to
describe what you would see

5
00:00:15,009 --> 00:00:19,090
had were you able to see them um this
will be called living with a GPS I think

6
00:00:19,090 --> 00:00:20,119
equities state to make

7
00:00:20,119 --> 00:00:27,119
yes program but for the other name 0

8
00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:31,650
value this could you could you turn on
the game is like a bit

9
00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:35,149
feel very close a goatee 12

10
00:00:35,149 --> 00:00:38,559
yeah outta here thank you will

11
00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:42,410
let's not waste the case um so

12
00:00:42,410 --> 00:00:46,140
most AutoNation PS are mostly I around

13
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:50,530
about state CA zones this is not that's
ok if you want that talk you go find

14
00:00:50,530 --> 00:00:52,409
Moxie multi is a great talk about that

15
00:00:52,409 --> 00:00:55,519
I am I'm not saying that now

16
00:00:55,519 --> 00:01:00,390
um but this talking about the fact that
most your website's

17
00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:04,049
local most your website probably don't
even get up to that level

18
00:01:04,049 --> 00:01:07,530
so you have to be doing really pretty
well it even start worrying about that

19
00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:12,409
on I'm a transport security person

20
00:01:12,409 --> 00:01:16,119
so throughout this talk the the model is
that we have to

21
00:01:16,119 --> 00:01:20,140
perfectly functional longer up to
computers talking over evil netbook

22
00:01:20,140 --> 00:01:23,390
so at no point to my concern myself with
the fact that

23
00:01:23,390 --> 00:01:27,150
people's machines that compromise that's
how security chrome disgrace on that as

24
00:01:27,150 --> 00:01:27,460
well

25
00:01:27,460 --> 00:01:31,640
but that's not me um and we assume that
work is going to be fabricating package

26
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:32,540
shopping packets

27
00:01:32,540 --> 00:01:36,899
I coaching packets and just up as a
basic lemma

28
00:01:36,899 --> 00:01:40,859
when we did with a CVS the also means
that the network can direct the user

29
00:01:40,859 --> 00:01:45,049
to any webpage because the network and
always in certain iframe in any

30
00:01:45,049 --> 00:01:48,159
random make people question me so we
just assume that

31
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:51,689
the attacker can always cordial grass
navigator any webpage

32
00:01:51,689 --> 00:01:54,920
is a somewhat non-obvious up

33
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:58,249
cholerae to the fact that the network
manager its so

34
00:01:58,249 --> 00:02:02,399
thats assume that sa are poor victim
user

35
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:05,409
goes their web browser and types in
mail.google.com

36
00:02:05,409 --> 00:02:09,369
et Santa sees this Locsin and the DUP

37
00:02:09,369 --> 00:02:12,410
as it came over they just lost if the in
Iran or Syria

38
00:02:12,410 --> 00:02:16,310
it might really be game over
unfortunately some of my users

39
00:02:16,310 --> 00:02:20,170
entrust their lives the products I have
to secure a and the southern come to

40
00:02:20,170 --> 00:02:21,020
position to be in

41
00:02:21,020 --> 00:02:25,420
but they do it and we do our best um
so-so hands up

42
00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:28,480
who in this room is looking at that
going oh that's obvious I would never

43
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:28,829
fall

44
00:02:28,830 --> 00:02:31,849
I would never have just been owned by my
government

45
00:02:31,849 --> 00:02:35,310
1 i me aur possibly write this is the
audience where

46
00:02:35,310 --> 00:02:38,650
where people will pick up on this but
the fact is that 99 percent

47
00:02:38,650 --> 00:02:42,260
people are not going to Nexus the it's
not a GPS site

48
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:46,049
I know even if you copy the text there's
no greenup this new green padlock

49
00:02:46,050 --> 00:02:51,020
the problem mister when you type male W
dot com the default protocol is in

50
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:53,280
secure default port cialis HTP

51
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:58,110
um so your browser will go for making
HTTP request with the networking quite

52
00:02:58,110 --> 00:02:59,040
happily answer

53
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:02,540
and give your login pages looks exactly
like we'll get a login page

54
00:03:02,540 --> 00:03:05,700
and people log in and they'll be
absolutely none the wiser

55
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:10,100
this code SSL stripping it is a
devastatingly effective attack

56
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:13,550
which will work against almost all
secure web sites out there

57
00:03:13,550 --> 00:03:19,200
even ones where a well I guess we expect
users to notice that is not secured by

58
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:21,180
the tiny black and green up other

59
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:25,650
um but there are other web sites where
it's an HTTP site but they say login

60
00:03:25,650 --> 00:03:27,100
using our secure server

61
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:30,950
the form is meant to submit over a CPS
at this point the user just hasn't

62
00:03:30,950 --> 00:03:34,230
there was no indication whether secured
on

63
00:03:34,230 --> 00:03:37,250
so before you start worrying about CA's
and all that stuff

64
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:40,970
this is what is going to to get these
now

65
00:03:40,970 --> 00:03:44,090
we don't have any reports in the wild
countries like

66
00:03:44,090 --> 00:03:48,890
Iran and Syria doing this but partially
we have really bad

67
00:03:48,890 --> 00:03:52,370
introspection these countries the set of
people in this country as it turns out

68
00:03:52,370 --> 00:03:53,140
you are

69
00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:56,590
technically knowledgeable bilingual
liberally minded

70
00:03:56,590 --> 00:04:00,270
is very small we do not find out when
terrible things happen in these

71
00:04:00,270 --> 00:04:01,330
countries very quickly

72
00:04:01,330 --> 00:04:05,570
so if there's ever thought happening
given how subtle it is

73
00:04:05,570 --> 00:04:09,420
we may never know the solution to this
is really quite straightforward

74
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:14,220
it's this this is a test yes HTTP strict
Transport Security

75
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:17,978
is a standard that allows web site to
tell browses they are always to be

76
00:04:17,978 --> 00:04:19,560
accessed every GPS

77
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:23,639
um this is the head a that you can set
on a nation UPS site

78
00:04:23,639 --> 00:04:27,770
and it says remember for a hundred days
I guess 86,000

79
00:04:27,770 --> 00:04:32,180
um four hundred times on just member
next 100 days the I'm

80
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:35,620
always be accessed over HTTPS and by the
way that means or supplements

81
00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:38,949
amo come back to why include subsidizes
import

82
00:04:38,949 --> 00:04:42,699
so this means that when you typed note
if you look on

83
00:04:42,699 --> 00:04:46,360
they will go over HTTPS initially um

84
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:50,180
and it means the this is impossible in
fact this is already impossible

85
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:53,950
because there are sites built into
Chrome which chrome knows

86
00:04:53,950 --> 00:04:57,729
H STS mailed it will calm the council
will call

87
00:04:57,730 --> 00:05:01,550
these are built in I had to alter this
page in game

88
00:05:01,550 --> 00:05:05,170
in order for it to get rid of the green
because it is not possible to access the

89
00:05:05,170 --> 00:05:07,400
site in Chrome and securely

90
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:10,420
Firefox and Chrome will remember these

91
00:05:10,420 --> 00:05:14,410
headers obviously there was a a
first-time problem if the user flashes

92
00:05:14,410 --> 00:05:15,570
that cash

93
00:05:15,570 --> 00:05:19,200
if the user insult your browser they
have a new profile then we don't

94
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:22,530
know this information so that getting it
built into the browser solves that

95
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:23,660
problem

96
00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:27,760
but this is that a scale now the way you
get it built in the crowd was very easy

97
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:31,230
you email me you email me and I say okay

98
00:05:31,230 --> 00:05:34,600
by your side this reason while check-ins
prime but wait

99
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:37,980
you want its claim surely emailing you
item is a ridiculous non scaleable

100
00:05:37,980 --> 00:05:40,260
methods including all these things into

101
00:05:40,260 --> 00:05:44,630
yeah and absolutely it is this
capability is not a problem that we have

102
00:05:44,630 --> 00:05:48,180
we have %uh in the built-in chrome lists
we have whole bunch

103
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:51,780
cool properties um we have paper house
also

104
00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:55,760
we have Twitter kinda sorta real soon
now the process

105
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:58,980
I and in terms of size you heard of that
is about it

106
00:05:58,980 --> 00:06:02,500
we have no banks but we have bombed
banks also iNDOT Mt

107
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:05,740
not sure what to anti is but the
financial institutions a more playful

108
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:06,790
than I was

109
00:06:06,790 --> 00:06:11,470
up because we have no back to contact me
saying everyone Stevens listless

110
00:06:11,470 --> 00:06:15,120
law maybe that's rational that point
maybe with a user's again owned by

111
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:17,590
malware so fast transport security is
not even

112
00:06:17,590 --> 00:06:20,960
a concern as um butts

113
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:24,080
but yes skating is is no problem we have
but nonetheless

114
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:27,300
a chest yes because I put it first
stalkers it's by far the most important

115
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:29,580
thing if you and nothing else please
remember this

116
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:32,990
%uh a test yes is wonderful and I we
coming back to white is wonderful in

117
00:06:32,990 --> 00:06:35,020
many different aspects about this talk

118
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:39,159
the next way in which is wonderful is it
turns this

119
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:42,650
right this is something that people
sadly see quite a loss but it turns this

120
00:06:42,650 --> 00:06:43,860
into this

121
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:48,060
and the important aspect is not that the
with the tax changes in the weather

122
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:52,419
the important aspect is here we have to
bosons this proceed anyway Busan

123
00:06:52,419 --> 00:06:55,359
god I hate that see anyway because they
would click Set we know the

124
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:58,100
statistically nearly 80 percent to prime
users click on that

125
00:06:58,100 --> 00:07:01,540
awesome when they see this page and this
is really red

126
00:07:01,540 --> 00:07:06,730
we can make this any more scary

127
00:07:06,730 --> 00:07:10,630
but this is really red and I Syria a
year ago

128
00:07:10,630 --> 00:07:14,260
did this to Facebook they didn't even
try right name an animal attacks

129
00:07:14,260 --> 00:07:14,909
Facebook

130
00:07:14,910 --> 00:07:17,980
they should've just SSL ship does that
work um

131
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:21,070
but they didn't they they were place
facebook.com with the bats if you go and

132
00:07:21,070 --> 00:07:21,930
you got this

133
00:07:21,930 --> 00:07:26,210
era and people click through as a
helluva right and I don't know what the

134
00:07:26,210 --> 00:07:30,080
human damage resulting from that was but
in Syria

135
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:33,139
not good a chest yes turns this

136
00:07:33,139 --> 00:07:37,490
into this an important thing here is
there is no proceed Dawson

137
00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:40,600
or certificate I was of fatal on a chest
yes its

138
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:44,370
it is completely ridiculous that we ask
our users to evaluate the security

139
00:07:44,370 --> 00:07:47,680
x5 announced efficace we should never
have done that

140
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:51,729
we are not into is a legacy item a test
yes is the way that we can crawl outta

141
00:07:51,729 --> 00:07:52,740
this

142
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:56,820
so with chrome if you go to mount a good
a common you are man the middle tax it

143
00:07:56,820 --> 00:07:58,440
does not work because the sick

144
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:02,250
the certificate ever only has a back
awesome

145
00:08:02,250 --> 00:08:05,810
um next up a chest yes will protect you
from

146
00:08:05,810 --> 00:08:09,760
from making mistakes even if you think
you are a great web sites

147
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:13,969
for example that's a %uh and its common
security practice we try to

148
00:08:13,970 --> 00:08:17,710
teach values as you need to type in a
CPS or you need you to bookmark

149
00:08:17,710 --> 00:08:21,270
using a bookmark is actually pretty good
idea so that's a you set up

150
00:08:21,270 --> 00:08:25,229
your mother's computer with a bookmark
for banking site ish clicks on it

151
00:08:25,229 --> 00:08:29,639
so um I'm not picking on Citibank by the
way they would get you the second site I

152
00:08:29,639 --> 00:08:30,979
tried

153
00:08:30,979 --> 00:08:34,208
and they have this problem I was
surprised the first sighted

154
00:08:34,209 --> 00:08:38,849
but this is a widespread problem which
citibank is merely inconvenient example

155
00:08:38,849 --> 00:08:42,229
so that say that you set up a bookmark
for this now you've gotten

156
00:08:42,229 --> 00:08:45,630
past the initial problem ACP's default
because you said

157
00:08:45,630 --> 00:08:50,990
but not with https plan for you on if
you do this what you get

158
00:08:50,990 --> 00:08:56,269
okay with this is the side the point I'm
psyche stepped Citibank what the hell

159
00:08:56,269 --> 00:09:01,060
um so this is a the strikes again DUP
DUP DUP the city back to come

160
00:09:01,060 --> 00:09:04,860
um you click on this but not what you
get

161
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:09,620
you get redirected back to http on a
course from there you get redirected to

162
00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:10,820
https again

163
00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:13,899
I'm but that's beside the point because
as soon as you've gotten to this point

164
00:09:13,899 --> 00:09:15,920
the attackers got there aid

165
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:19,029
again game over lotsa sites do this
because

166
00:09:19,029 --> 00:09:23,100
from citibank's want to do everything
works is completely sign is competing on

167
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:23,510
obvious

168
00:09:23,510 --> 00:09:26,660
something horribly wrong everything
works and

169
00:09:26,660 --> 00:09:29,689
choose him as a size do this they reject
range about spat between

170
00:09:29,690 --> 00:09:33,450
sleepiness UPS um

171
00:09:33,450 --> 00:09:36,980
I'm going to to sort a step away from
accessed yes for a second

172
00:09:36,980 --> 00:09:40,710
assuming you get that done the next
thing which is going to completely

173
00:09:40,710 --> 00:09:41,260
destroy

174
00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:46,510
all security on your site other 34 spent
over the mic scripting apocalypse

175
00:09:46,510 --> 00:09:50,670
right if you have any of these three

176
00:09:50,670 --> 00:09:54,709
on your website San Diego it is really
easy to do it you have no security is

177
00:09:54,710 --> 00:09:55,800
over

178
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:59,410
what these are doing is these are
directing an HTTPS web page

179
00:09:59,410 --> 00:10:03,120
to Lowes content from a sheepy active
contact

180
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:06,700
you can load images and that's not great
attack mice the image phone

181
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:11,640
um it's not fantastic but it happens if
you do this than the attacker gets to

182
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:12,370
run

183
00:10:12,370 --> 00:10:17,450
Germany arbitrary JavaScript in your
origin I wish for musical that game over

184
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:20,510
this is incredibly easy to do because

185
00:10:20,510 --> 00:10:24,960
if you have a site that's so they were
both HTTP and HTTPS the attack it gets

186
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:26,500
to pick the page

187
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:31,130
so these pages which you do not which no
use in a normal flow

188
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:36,670
would ever get to over HTTPS if this
survey for a GPS and they have this

189
00:10:36,670 --> 00:10:41,029
in which will never cause a problem
because that meant to be served if HTP

190
00:10:41,029 --> 00:10:44,810
that's enough the attack against a pic
the pages has this problem

191
00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:48,810
the way to try and saw his eyes to get a
good habits good habits in this case

192
00:10:48,810 --> 00:10:50,959
involves schematic view or else

193
00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:55,310
which I relatively obscura but
completely browser compatible

194
00:10:55,310 --> 00:10:58,410
stunningly these work everywhere no
problem we use among do with a calm

195
00:10:58,410 --> 00:11:02,110
all the time we are quite large website

196
00:11:02,110 --> 00:11:06,010
you use this and it will adopt the
scheme from the front page

197
00:11:06,010 --> 00:11:10,350
so this nation P pages nation be lowered
yes page they CPS lows

198
00:11:10,350 --> 00:11:14,260
um the only downside is if you look at
your web sites when is on desk

199
00:11:14,260 --> 00:11:18,569
then it will be file and you'll have it
the final protocol and then it

200
00:11:18,570 --> 00:11:22,279
but nonetheless this is a good habit to
get into because there will be browsers

201
00:11:22,279 --> 00:11:26,880
for decades to come which will load Nick
scripting users are using that

202
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:30,800
you in trouble but realistically

203
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:34,180
persuading every webmaster in the world
to understand this problem into

204
00:11:34,180 --> 00:11:37,520
and to not screw up when it's incredibly
easy to do so

205
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:40,939
%uh is not a going concern so instead
was going to have to happen is the

206
00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:42,399
browser's gonna have to block

207
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:45,940
make scripts so to their credit I E nine

208
00:11:45,940 --> 00:11:49,690
does this I E 92 or chrome you're quite
embarrassed

209
00:11:49,690 --> 00:11:52,870
we scramble to do it as fast as we could
but its is really tough to deploy

210
00:11:52,870 --> 00:11:54,220
because so many people

211
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:58,200
messes up but now glad to say in croatia
you do

212
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:02,940
a I'm expecting lows you get this it
does not work but I felt

213
00:12:02,940 --> 00:12:06,470
um this obviously is a CSS load has been
boxers

214
00:12:06,470 --> 00:12:09,709
New York Times's is looking like 1995

215
00:12:09,709 --> 00:12:12,740
on that on these damn buttons again

216
00:12:12,740 --> 00:12:16,970
but he will go away this is we're going
to have this for 12-18 months

217
00:12:16,970 --> 00:12:21,350
and then the don't know possible go away
it's already gone away for some sites

218
00:12:21,350 --> 00:12:25,959
I and then we'll just block me scripting
but not all the users you can rely on

219
00:12:25,959 --> 00:12:30,529
to be using ie9 crow so you still have
to pay attention expecting problems

220
00:12:30,529 --> 00:12:34,510
they can still school uses on

221
00:12:34,510 --> 00:12:37,649
the next unfortunate problem we r laden
with

222
00:12:37,649 --> 00:12:43,390
from HTTPS is HTP in a CBS cookie jars
all the same thing

223
00:12:43,390 --> 00:12:48,279
so we remember we we assume are
attacking course the user's browser to

224
00:12:48,279 --> 00:12:48,600
load

225
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:52,610
any page thing just injects iframes any
in secure those

226
00:12:52,610 --> 00:12:57,209
so if you set a cookie on East vs sites
and they cause the browser to load some

227
00:12:57,209 --> 00:12:59,380
sub domains that cookies will be sent
along

228
00:12:59,380 --> 00:13:03,480
this is fannie standard and and
hopefully those of you who have lost in

229
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:06,760
the audience know that you can set the
security tag on a cookie

230
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:12,649
which says only send over HTTPS don't
send this cookie over HTTP requests

231
00:13:12,649 --> 00:13:16,640
um this is a complete my asthma

232
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:21,399
features again if you forget to set this
tack everything works just perfectly

233
00:13:21,399 --> 00:13:25,279
we can automatically figure anything in
the browser because sites quite

234
00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:26,399
legitimately set

235
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:29,870
cookies which are both secure and
insecure and so

236
00:13:29,870 --> 00:13:34,130
sites miss this type of time you know if
they get it right now with the next

237
00:13:34,130 --> 00:13:34,980
revision

238
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:38,230
they forget it and nothing breaks

239
00:13:38,230 --> 00:13:43,360
um bus a chest yes will solve this
problem for you

240
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:46,640
if you said HST essence a include all
subdomains

241
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:49,899
that means the files etc so if the
attacker cannot make your browser to an

242
00:13:49,899 --> 00:13:51,589
ACP load

243
00:13:51,589 --> 00:13:55,080
because order to https you've already
said that

244
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:59,390
there was a second part to this fax
which most people miss

245
00:13:59,390 --> 00:14:03,529
which is the not only will HTTPS cookies
be sent

246
00:14:03,529 --> 00:14:06,550
on the EP bequests HTP

247
00:14:06,550 --> 00:14:10,560
HTTP requests can set ATVs cookies

248
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:15,310
if I is an attacker force you to do an
HTTP knows I can do a set cookie

249
00:14:15,310 --> 00:14:17,370
which'll over right cookies

250
00:14:17,370 --> 00:14:20,450
that was set on HTTPS so as an attacker

251
00:14:20,450 --> 00:14:25,040
when you are saying log into Gmail I can
make you do a load I can lock you in its

252
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:26,120
me

253
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:30,360
and just as you click Send Mail that
mail gets sent into my outbox and I

254
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:33,890
cannot be back in as you and you never
know it happens

255
00:14:33,890 --> 00:14:38,010
%uh HS yes protect you from this as well
for the sack in the same reason

256
00:14:38,010 --> 00:14:41,130
if we prevent HTP lows and there's no
way the attacking

257
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:45,620
get the cookie to set it um sorry I mean
the second get cocky but they can't get

258
00:14:45,620 --> 00:14:46,040
the

259
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:49,680
HTTP request to set the cookie up

260
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:53,360
and actually for example mailed it will
calm at least you know in Firefox and

261
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:53,790
Chrome

262
00:14:53,790 --> 00:14:57,819
it won't work because if a chest yes

263
00:14:57,820 --> 00:15:01,959
um at this point if you fix the see
problems you are in the top

264
00:15:01,959 --> 00:15:05,149
not .1 percent of secure web sites

265
00:15:05,149 --> 00:15:10,040
I possibly even more because I basically
never see sights

266
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:13,439
which are not run by people who work
with me the get this

267
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:17,450
all this right these three things HS yes
make scripting

268
00:15:17,450 --> 00:15:21,190
cookie secure up so

269
00:15:21,190 --> 00:15:24,410
if you know if you need to run away you
can do so now you've got a most the

270
00:15:24,410 --> 00:15:27,189
value this talk

271
00:15:27,190 --> 00:15:31,120
um next if you have a bonus points put
your website into

272
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:34,130
SSL laps as a lobster is a

273
00:15:34,130 --> 00:15:37,990
let me to the site which runs in tests
and you give you a great and

274
00:15:37,990 --> 00:15:40,810
I don't know how the greatest determined
but it would sell they will tell you a

275
00:15:40,810 --> 00:15:41,860
bunch of things

276
00:15:41,860 --> 00:15:45,290
a bunch of hard to diagnose stuff the
people commonly get wrong it was a you

277
00:15:45,290 --> 00:15:45,990
got it wrong

278
00:15:45,990 --> 00:15:49,579
which is very good to know the only cat
yes I have I don't

279
00:15:49,579 --> 00:15:53,029
on this website is it more screen about
something called the peace attack

280
00:15:53,029 --> 00:15:56,730
and you shouldn't worry about that
because the presence of excess enough

281
00:15:56,730 --> 00:15:59,769
at quite frankly staggering display

282
00:15:59,769 --> 00:16:04,339
cooperation all the browsers together or
decided that they're willing to break

283
00:16:04,339 --> 00:16:07,180
some old web sites in order to fix this
problem

284
00:16:07,180 --> 00:16:11,519
um hands Firefox was a little bit behind
and they took some shoving but they got

285
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:12,490
there eventually

286
00:16:12,490 --> 00:16:16,920
as an hour or two browsers Apache use 1
and -1 back what's missing

287
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:20,170
and so service don't need to worry about
the peace attacked by an easing of the

288
00:16:20,170 --> 00:16:22,290
four SSL lapsed

289
00:16:22,290 --> 00:16:25,420
other than that this is a fantastic site
if you run

290
00:16:25,420 --> 00:16:30,750
an HTTPS server you should put yourself
in that case it takes only 30 seconds

291
00:16:30,750 --> 00:16:34,399
um next up none of this is worth
anything

292
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:38,589
if you have a real specific it star eso
giving away free

293
00:16:38,589 --> 00:16:42,370
that Israeli company my one dude I think
he has some stuff that is mostly

294
00:16:42,370 --> 00:16:43,410
wondered

295
00:16:43,410 --> 00:16:46,459
up so I

296
00:16:46,459 --> 00:16:50,050
this we have them now it's not just that
he okay I'm but nonetheless

297
00:16:50,050 --> 00:16:53,450
start as a setter we'll see every day or
two states they have

298
00:16:53,450 --> 00:16:56,940
decent penetration I don't think they
win xp but nonetheless if you're

299
00:16:56,940 --> 00:16:59,730
currently running a self-signed
certificate and you for sure users to

300
00:16:59,730 --> 00:17:01,000
click to every single time

301
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:06,740
please stop training them to click to
that damn vet screen

302
00:17:06,740 --> 00:17:12,138
other in the lakes XP okay so so if you
use using XP sp3 I guess

303
00:17:12,139 --> 00:17:15,230
someone might be um then even worse that

304
00:17:15,230 --> 00:17:18,639
but like a set they have the most god
awful website in the world is complete

305
00:17:18,639 --> 00:17:21,399
nightmare use but they get away we'll
see if it goes for free

306
00:17:21,399 --> 00:17:25,589
so if you are using a self-signed so so
you would not doing HTTPS because if

307
00:17:25,589 --> 00:17:26,888
this problem

308
00:17:26,889 --> 00:17:30,279
this is this is your answer.

309
00:17:30,279 --> 00:17:35,049
um next up was a oh yes consider Fort
secrecy again this is just for bonus

310
00:17:35,049 --> 00:17:36,000
points

311
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,280
if you've gotten ace STS make scripting

312
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:42,730
and your cookies correct you can go home
and sleep you're doing great

313
00:17:42,730 --> 00:17:46,990
if you are looking for bonus points
think about forty see

314
00:17:46,990 --> 00:17:51,450
um if you've been to the the talks at
the AFF gave

315
00:17:51,450 --> 00:17:55,390
two days ago and yesterday then and
hopefully they've explain to you the

316
00:17:55,390 --> 00:17:55,850
value

317
00:17:55,850 --> 00:17:59,030
maybe not looking maybe having retention
policy

318
00:17:59,030 --> 00:18:02,889
um I and I'm suing the folks like you

319
00:18:02,890 --> 00:18:05,960
run website used by people in countries
which

320
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:09,049
which'll that's really useful um

321
00:18:09,049 --> 00:18:12,970
but if you are not using for secrecy
then it might be that someone else is

322
00:18:12,970 --> 00:18:15,280
doing the lobbying for you

323
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:18,990
I now I'm hoping that nobody here is a
beginner

324
00:18:18,990 --> 00:18:23,390
so I'm assuming that you know when I
talk about SSL you gonna know the basics

325
00:18:23,390 --> 00:18:27,270
but most the time I if you have a lot of
opening use Chrome and you click the

326
00:18:27,270 --> 00:18:28,049
green padlock

327
00:18:28,049 --> 00:18:31,650
will tell you the key exchange method
used for that connection a typically it

328
00:18:31,650 --> 00:18:32,360
will be our essay

329
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:35,370
I a novice a key exchange in TLS

330
00:18:35,370 --> 00:18:39,460
means that the client pics session key a
random session key

331
00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:42,730
encrypts it to the service public key
and send it to the serb

332
00:18:42,730 --> 00:18:45,900
and we know the service who they say
they are present in the mail server

333
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:46,419
could decrease

334
00:18:46,419 --> 00:18:49,919
that session key complete magic this is
perfectly fine

335
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:53,210
but it means the any point in the future

336
00:18:53,210 --> 00:18:57,070
that Rs a private key is sufficient to
detect that session

337
00:18:57,070 --> 00:19:01,370
again so if anybody has recorded the
handshake

338
00:19:01,370 --> 00:19:04,770
and they get your private key any point
in the future they can t cryptic

339
00:19:04,770 --> 00:19:05,860
retrospectively

340
00:19:05,860 --> 00:19:10,700
um I have not yet heard any law
enforcement agency or autocratic

341
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:13,730
government include far enough to cause
traffic

342
00:19:13,730 --> 00:19:17,480
and then exploit the private key out but

343
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:22,140
they keep on getting better right the
autocratic governments that they were

344
00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:25,000
pretty clear for the star and they were
using off-the-shelf stuff in

345
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:28,040
though they've moved on from
off-the-shelf stuff I

346
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:31,950
hands this is something like a set for
bonus points that will probably be more

347
00:19:31,950 --> 00:19:33,669
important about five years time

348
00:19:33,669 --> 00:19:38,040
that harm in getting to it now so what
forward secrecy means are often using

349
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:39,700
our essay for key exchange

350
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:43,710
we use one of the two methods key
agreements the test supports

351
00:19:43,710 --> 00:19:47,890
the calls as a service to make up a
public key for that one connection

352
00:19:47,890 --> 00:19:51,400
sign the public key and then use that to
be the key

353
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:55,090
now after the connections finish the
public key is destroyed

354
00:19:55,090 --> 00:19:58,149
so the information required to keep it
that connection

355
00:19:58,150 --> 00:20:01,880
does not leave beyond the lifetime in
that connection there is no possibility

356
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:03,440
retrospective decryption

357
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:07,309
even in 10 years time when you are so he
can be factored we still combat

358
00:20:07,309 --> 00:20:07,910
respectively

359
00:20:07,910 --> 00:20:11,679
d crips these connections um

360
00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:14,740
the way you enable this in your config
is that you promotes

361
00:20:14,740 --> 00:20:19,960
d'Huez th e cycle sweets on the most you
if you run so it was a pretty where this

362
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:20,990
incredibly

363
00:20:20,990 --> 00:20:25,179
alt line that's popping your Apache
config says SSL cipher suites

364
00:20:25,179 --> 00:20:28,710
which includes a snippet from a text
fourth-quarter fumble open SSL

365
00:20:28,710 --> 00:20:33,620
and has lots of exclamation mark some
words like all in high and medium

366
00:20:33,620 --> 00:20:37,090
an amnio plus ATS all this stuff

367
00:20:37,090 --> 00:20:40,520
um you can take that string and you can
plug it into

368
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:44,299
open SSL ciphers and I'll tell you a
lisp and into this a site visit it means

369
00:20:44,299 --> 00:20:49,639
what you want is that you want the HeNe
CDH is life is to be at the top

370
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:53,350
I'm realistically I'm not going to be
able to explain all the ins and outs

371
00:20:53,350 --> 00:20:56,669
forward secrecy and their interactions
recession tickets right now

372
00:20:56,669 --> 00:21:00,840
we get two questions somebody here once
ross me I'll go on about it

373
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:04,280
this is more a pointer to those who want
to know the

374
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:07,129
0 aggression looking for safe to say
maybe I should do a Google search on

375
00:21:07,130 --> 00:21:08,030
that and see our

376
00:21:08,030 --> 00:21:11,770
think my web server um

377
00:21:11,770 --> 00:21:15,990
again for bonus points unless so you
should keep this offer up-to-date

378
00:21:15,990 --> 00:21:19,789
and I don't mean just means security
provisions I take that for granted

379
00:21:19,789 --> 00:21:23,730
I I have patches and I think hofer the
Opus

380
00:21:23,730 --> 00:21:27,429
security advisories in the past yield to
up

381
00:21:27,429 --> 00:21:31,130
they keep on coming up quite a great you
have to keep up to date with you

382
00:21:31,130 --> 00:21:34,580
security advisories enough to sell your
web seven so

383
00:21:34,580 --> 00:21:39,110
but beyond blessed open SSL actually
gets better over time it's a very mature

384
00:21:39,110 --> 00:21:40,010
live free

385
00:21:40,010 --> 00:21:43,110
but we are working on it and he is one
example

386
00:21:43,110 --> 00:21:46,380
sofa I'm in the bottom maybe cut off by
heads for some %uh view

387
00:21:46,380 --> 00:21:50,530
about the three bars are basically the
last three major revisions open SSL

388
00:21:50,530 --> 00:21:53,850
not 9/8 10 101 on

389
00:21:53,850 --> 00:21:58,850
and the the height above the more Rs a
2048 bit prime operations you can do per

390
00:21:58,850 --> 00:21:59,840
second

391
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:02,860
now this is just straight maths its a

392
00:22:02,860 --> 00:22:06,010
rights and exponentiation um over

393
00:22:06,010 --> 00:22:09,080
a group and you think the CPU

394
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:12,740
pretty much max out it turns out that if
you get Intel to

395
00:22:12,740 --> 00:22:16,120
put researchers onto the problem they
can come up with a nice code in which we

396
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:17,570
got in 101 C

397
00:22:17,570 --> 00:22:20,649
answers a straight 30 percent
improvement on what should be completely

398
00:22:20,650 --> 00:22:24,679
CPU balance just by taking us of what
that's quite sweet

399
00:22:24,679 --> 00:22:28,980
um again if you enable forward secrecy
and you use easy th e

400
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:32,370
'em like for example be with us by the
way

401
00:22:32,370 --> 00:22:36,330
um then the the CPU looking up slightly

402
00:22:36,330 --> 00:22:40,370
but as long as you're running the latest
version FSL doesn't go up that much

403
00:22:40,370 --> 00:22:44,720
so his the the cd8 she PT fussy
operations per second

404
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:49,240
which you even know is that the
additional CPU cost to doing food

405
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:50,860
security

406
00:22:50,860 --> 00:22:55,880
are in or sign a sweet have 1500 here
and then we actually dropped in 100

407
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:59,780
which is unfortunate but we made the
code constant I'm

408
00:22:59,780 --> 00:23:04,480
so previously I NEC dhea you have to
raise

409
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:07,669
a value to the a wow it's a that is a

410
00:23:07,669 --> 00:23:11,419
politically you multiply a value by your
private key

411
00:23:11,419 --> 00:23:14,950
and in not 9 a.m. at a time that takes
depends on your private key

412
00:23:14,950 --> 00:23:19,039
which is kinda unfortunate up to cite
China assists if the sack a measure how

413
00:23:19,039 --> 00:23:21,580
long you're taking to do it they can
start to guess things about your private

414
00:23:21,580 --> 00:23:21,918
key

415
00:23:21,919 --> 00:23:27,070
so we got we have all that in 100 I made
a constant I'm so at least use 100

416
00:23:27,070 --> 00:23:30,289
and then for 101 C um

417
00:23:30,289 --> 00:23:33,379
I decided to deploy this for Google and

418
00:23:33,380 --> 00:23:37,299
and this speed was not going to suffice
so I V voted with

419
00:23:37,299 --> 00:23:41,070
a couple my colleague spoke to any media
and

420
00:23:41,070 --> 00:23:44,520
right and so if you're doing this you
really want beer 101 C she wants me this

421
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:46,129
bar not this book

422
00:23:46,130 --> 00:23:49,650
um and the actually the problem here is
the

423
00:23:49,650 --> 00:23:53,289
I previously with Cinco for damn
bernstein's

424
00:23:53,289 --> 00:23:56,640
sketchy 5519 which is a beautiful curve
whereas

425
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:59,820
P 256 is kind of apollo to I

426
00:23:59,820 --> 00:24:04,178
the nest I understand what they're
trying to do but it was short-sighted

427
00:24:04,179 --> 00:24:07,410
and the Prime is a huge pain in the neck
and I did things I shouldn't have done

428
00:24:07,410 --> 00:24:08,720
and I can get this ball

429
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:11,860
for the next release um

430
00:24:11,860 --> 00:24:15,400
but I guess so you should pay attention
to over seven aces

431
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:19,020
I'm waiting for time because this is I
miss as well right

432
00:24:19,020 --> 00:24:22,500
this was the the first half my talk
which is the the public service

433
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:25,630
announcement for SSL

434
00:24:25,630 --> 00:24:28,669
um the next part my talk

435
00:24:28,669 --> 00:24:31,820
I'm I'm going to go on about something
we call public keeping

436
00:24:31,820 --> 00:24:36,010
now that this is this is double secret
secure bonus points

437
00:24:36,010 --> 00:24:39,840
I am from this point onwards I i'm I'm
basically going on

438
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:43,250
less about practical stuff that you
really should do

439
00:24:43,250 --> 00:24:47,360
I'm more about future stuff may be more
interesting maybe less interesting

440
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:51,760
but here is a a very stylized
representation what certificate looks

441
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:52,100
like

442
00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:55,320
we we have a who is it about

443
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:58,689
says who what's the public key

444
00:24:58,690 --> 00:25:03,080
and where can I fetch a certificate says
who

445
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:07,110
um and that's really what it says all
this is saying it's Bar CA

446
00:25:07,110 --> 00:25:10,330
is saying that the holder of this
private key

447
00:25:10,330 --> 00:25:14,539
is food I'll call right and then we take
these

448
00:25:14,539 --> 00:25:18,330
and we put them into what we call a
chain so

449
00:25:18,330 --> 00:25:24,189
so the top here we have RCA says things
about food or calm

450
00:25:24,190 --> 00:25:27,860
and this could be bossy a Amboseli a is
signed by

451
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:30,970
Paris that's a now

452
00:25:30,970 --> 00:25:34,320
if you read the specs they say that TS
servers

453
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:38,389
um they must send this difficult it's in
the correct order

454
00:25:38,390 --> 00:25:42,350
they must send exactly the right
certificates and they must not include

455
00:25:42,350 --> 00:25:43,530
the route because

456
00:25:43,530 --> 00:25:46,700
that silly the Klein either already has
entrusted or it doesn't and it's not

457
00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:48,520
going to work

458
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:52,440
the reality is thats up this is always
first

459
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:56,120
that's true that's not first nothing
works but some

460
00:25:56,120 --> 00:26:00,950
as a browser vendor the reality is that
sites include only the certificates

461
00:26:00,950 --> 00:26:04,110
they include this and the ins media and
the roots

462
00:26:04,110 --> 00:26:07,020
they include this the intermediate some
other intermediate they heard about

463
00:26:07,020 --> 00:26:07,780
choose

464
00:26:07,780 --> 00:26:11,168
they include this another leaves
difficult for the other web server

465
00:26:11,169 --> 00:26:13,169
mostly intermediates most polls roots

466
00:26:13,169 --> 00:26:16,720
and the base to go for a drive by
shooting approach where they do about 12

467
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:17,380
certificates

468
00:26:17,380 --> 00:26:20,190
in the hopes that the process will be
able to pick out the correct ones and

469
00:26:20,190 --> 00:26:21,360
just figure it out

470
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:24,710
and it actually works because the
president really nice about that

471
00:26:24,710 --> 00:26:27,580
we completely ignore the standards or
browse is complete you know the

472
00:26:27,580 --> 00:26:28,520
standards

473
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:31,820
and actually they simply take the first
one a call that the leaf

474
00:26:31,820 --> 00:26:35,059
and then just tried desperately to build
some chain from there

475
00:26:35,059 --> 00:26:38,399
to a true they know about using any
intermediate they can get their grubby

476
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:40,090
hands off

477
00:26:40,090 --> 00:26:45,270
now they will take into media stable
cash them from prior connections

478
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:49,210
they will download them over HTTP if
they have to

479
00:26:49,210 --> 00:26:52,710
um they will just take all the other
stuff because the service and put them

480
00:26:52,710 --> 00:26:55,780
into a big porn just try to weave some
threat truest

481
00:26:55,780 --> 00:27:00,220
and what this means is that most the
time it works

482
00:27:00,220 --> 00:27:05,940
however what it also means is the as a
website operator you have no idea what

483
00:27:05,940 --> 00:27:09,710
the hell kinda chain some browsers gonna
make for your website

484
00:27:09,710 --> 00:27:13,070
it's almost certainly not going to be
the one you presented to even if you get

485
00:27:13,070 --> 00:27:14,360
it right

486
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:18,179
um and then just a to make things even
more wonderful

487
00:27:18,179 --> 00:27:22,059
this is an X 509 distinguished name

488
00:27:22,059 --> 00:27:26,710
which was designed by the salsa people
who like to put things into boxes

489
00:27:26,710 --> 00:27:31,080
I and it was is on it is designed to
some massive high Rocco global namespace

490
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:35,730
where everything in the world to be
named by this distinguished name

491
00:27:35,730 --> 00:27:39,049
I everything that's names would be
unique now

492
00:27:39,049 --> 00:27:42,158
obviously that didn't really work out
but in addition to that

493
00:27:42,159 --> 00:27:45,760
CA's will frequently the issue
certificates with exactly the same name

494
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:46,559
for the defense

495
00:27:46,559 --> 00:27:49,740
tickets they would do so in order to I

496
00:27:49,740 --> 00:27:53,169
to update the expiry time it's if it's
going to expire

497
00:27:53,169 --> 00:27:58,039
there or do so because they want to
reissue the new hash function

498
00:27:58,039 --> 00:28:01,350
they'll do so because I just wanna put
stuff in there and sometimes they will

499
00:28:01,350 --> 00:28:04,440
do so and there was no difference
between the two is difficult to accept

500
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:06,220
the serial number

501
00:28:06,220 --> 00:28:09,510
what white I now um some CA's

502
00:28:09,510 --> 00:28:13,460
issue certificates that a test the fact
that the Civic is invalid for the use of

503
00:28:13,460 --> 00:28:14,440
a CA

504
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:18,250
and then they reissue because obviously
budget lines grew up in sight

505
00:28:18,250 --> 00:28:21,720
what the hell asuncion issue key usage
is this a

506
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:25,330
this see a stiff you can be used to keep
dreamin of signing certificates and show

507
00:28:25,330 --> 00:28:25,629
they

508
00:28:25,630 --> 00:28:30,720
issue those two I and so even if the
browser's didn't desperately tried to

509
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:31,610
throw rights

510
00:28:31,610 --> 00:28:38,090
somehow through everything fines CA's
issue most pollution roots intermediates

511
00:28:38,090 --> 00:28:41,850
so there is there was no way that you
can possibly know what chain

512
00:28:41,850 --> 00:28:45,450
routes going to build your website now

513
00:28:45,450 --> 00:28:49,450
what we want to do about two years ago
was that folk Google

514
00:28:49,450 --> 00:28:54,240
and chrome I as above Android and we
have a process was followed along with

515
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:54,990
us

516
00:28:54,990 --> 00:28:58,529
we wanted to say that we know the
specific it's for good luck on the issue

517
00:28:58,529 --> 00:28:59,610
by our CA's

518
00:28:59,610 --> 00:29:03,000
we don't want the browsers to accept
just old any old

519
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:06,659
CA arm and

520
00:29:06,659 --> 00:29:10,039
and so we said well we should build a
national certificates

521
00:29:10,039 --> 00:29:13,990
Amanda me well wait how that doesn't
work because we can hash if this if this

522
00:29:13,990 --> 00:29:17,350
was we have no idea what they're going
to be

523
00:29:17,350 --> 00:29:21,659
the only thing we can roughly do is this
subject public info

524
00:29:21,659 --> 00:29:25,289
which is the X 59 name for public-key we
can say that

525
00:29:25,289 --> 00:29:28,629
whatever ends up here its public key

526
00:29:28,630 --> 00:29:32,779
must be bad is a validation the
signature on this certificate

527
00:29:32,779 --> 00:29:36,450
so maybe that works and your whatever
ends up here it must assign the

528
00:29:36,450 --> 00:29:37,190
intermediate

529
00:29:37,190 --> 00:29:41,429
now now maybe the actually this was a
chamber in 10 days

530
00:29:41,429 --> 00:29:44,640
maybe another intermediate came over
here next year redirected the change a

531
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:46,650
completely different groups

532
00:29:46,650 --> 00:29:50,059
that's a possibility but we just had to
say well script because we can't do

533
00:29:50,059 --> 00:29:52,039
anything about that

534
00:29:52,039 --> 00:29:55,309
so what we have done is something that
we call public keeping

535
00:29:55,309 --> 00:29:58,668
which says that when we validate our
site we require

536
00:29:58,669 --> 00:30:01,679
in the chain somewhere is one or more

537
00:30:01,679 --> 00:30:05,159
a number of known public keys so

538
00:30:05,159 --> 00:30:08,770
the most secure thing you can do is you
can say the pup my public either

539
00:30:08,770 --> 00:30:10,360
publicly I hold no one else

540
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:14,890
hats must be in the chain arm

541
00:30:14,890 --> 00:30:18,240
and that obviously is the most secure
because nobody else you have no

542
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:21,350
that the private key corresponding to it

543
00:30:21,350 --> 00:30:24,470
the issue being that we ve issue of
certificates on

544
00:30:24,470 --> 00:30:28,179
you almost a weekly basis we were tight
us to pick its and so %uh public key

545
00:30:28,179 --> 00:30:30,059
change every time we do that

546
00:30:30,059 --> 00:30:33,510
I just a matter of hygiene you want to
to get with the Okies

547
00:30:33,510 --> 00:30:37,408
last possible and turn them over um and
also

548
00:30:37,409 --> 00:30:39,890
you if you do that you could be a little
bit worried that you're going to lose

549
00:30:39,890 --> 00:30:40,929
your private key

550
00:30:40,929 --> 00:30:44,200
right is kinda have a trade-off you can
tell the whole world

551
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:48,559
my civil always be signed by this public
even if you lose the private power

552
00:30:48,559 --> 00:30:53,230
then then your whole web sites right
down with with no very good plan on

553
00:30:53,230 --> 00:30:55,230
getting ever backup

554
00:30:55,230 --> 00:30:58,760
so growth in doing that when public
keeping we want just

555
00:30:58,760 --> 00:31:02,260
week generally safe to do at least um

556
00:31:02,260 --> 00:31:05,850
will take will take this intermediate
which we have to control

557
00:31:05,850 --> 00:31:09,950
because we fusion we can do that um but
was it is in the media and this route

558
00:31:09,950 --> 00:31:14,440
a mill say the for Google com you go to
be you will either be signed by the SRU

559
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:18,190
all this into media a member we can show
this in our case

560
00:31:18,190 --> 00:31:21,980
so we can go to a different CA and say
he's crossed synar into media

561
00:31:21,980 --> 00:31:25,070
we can change the A's so we are not
finding ourselves

562
00:31:25,070 --> 00:31:29,658
into one CA for the first time because
that bad because an awesome money

563
00:31:29,659 --> 00:31:33,419
um ands you know there is a possibility
that

564
00:31:33,419 --> 00:31:37,450
should 3 very specifically size measure
right strike it

565
00:31:37,450 --> 00:31:41,020
three locations on earth week Patch
loses intermediate

566
00:31:41,020 --> 00:31:44,770
but then we can go to RCA our current
one and safeties give us a new staffing

567
00:31:44,770 --> 00:31:48,429
and that's okay because we believe that
public you as well

568
00:31:48,429 --> 00:31:54,010
and so although no not not perfectly
trusting RCA trusting someone

569
00:31:54,010 --> 00:31:57,010
to is not us they have a key to sign for
us

570
00:31:57,010 --> 00:32:01,549
it's still a heck of a lot better than
trusting the hundreds RCA's out there

571
00:32:01,549 --> 00:32:06,110
I I'm we did this and we deploy this I
am

572
00:32:06,110 --> 00:32:10,590
kinda turns out a very very fortuitous
time we didn't know this

573
00:32:10,590 --> 00:32:14,429
but it turns out we deployed it probably
in between the Iranian government

574
00:32:14,429 --> 00:32:15,190
testing

575
00:32:15,190 --> 00:32:18,830
them and the middle attack and the
running government deploying it

576
00:32:18,830 --> 00:32:25,830
so when they tested it it works and when
to deploy did it didn't

577
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:33,799
and so that was that they became known
to did you know talk ace I

578
00:32:33,799 --> 00:32:37,899
where I got an email wanna come in which
day of the week it was morning

579
00:32:37,899 --> 00:32:42,990
I think it was a Monday morning who had
a week with a screenshot from one of the

580
00:32:42,990 --> 00:32:47,590
the very few technique omadam bilingual
liberty minded people in Iran

581
00:32:47,590 --> 00:32:50,870
saying ice on the con- use Google I get

582
00:32:50,870 --> 00:32:55,029
you know I get this great big red screen
and because it's a chest yes there is no

583
00:32:55,029 --> 00:32:56,919
proceed button

584
00:32:56,919 --> 00:33:01,140
I get this great big red screen and I
used open SSL Mike Dunn's difficult

585
00:33:01,140 --> 00:33:01,890
change

586
00:33:01,890 --> 00:33:06,220
thank you thank you for s thank you for
knowing to do that

587
00:33:06,220 --> 00:33:10,230
and not email me a screenshot um

588
00:33:10,230 --> 00:33:14,690
I I tied up to this and my colleagues
are you up to this Welsh

589
00:33:14,690 --> 00:33:17,929
it and then so that was it did you know
it's all week

590
00:33:17,929 --> 00:33:22,080
I am for those who don't know DigiNotar
is now an X company

591
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:28,870
thou's it that debt them all

592
00:33:28,870 --> 00:33:32,279
I and so public key pending if you are

593
00:33:32,279 --> 00:33:36,159
this order web sites which which gets
the social things done

594
00:33:36,159 --> 00:33:41,000
which which includes us which includes
at the moment toward and Twitter

595
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:46,130
arm then email me and say hey I was
targeted by this government allies in

596
00:33:46,130 --> 00:33:49,380
this note assets or something along
those lines say I'm important stuff

597
00:33:49,380 --> 00:33:53,370
I will work with you the public keep in
your website in Chrome

598
00:33:53,370 --> 00:33:56,630
I think Firefox sniffing at taking our
list

599
00:33:56,630 --> 00:34:00,950
building in 25 Oct two um if you are not

600
00:34:00,950 --> 00:34:05,549
one of those web sites um I am afraid I
can't promise to do this for everyone

601
00:34:05,549 --> 00:34:06,418
was it takes

602
00:34:06,419 --> 00:34:10,079
a whole buncha time on hand holding set
this up

603
00:34:10,079 --> 00:34:15,569
I have a chest yes I do for any we have
splendid bacon dot com NHS guest list

604
00:34:15,569 --> 00:34:19,069
but the public key pending it takes me a
buncha times already do for the the

605
00:34:19,069 --> 00:34:21,399
salsa sites which i think are worth are
doing it for

606
00:34:21,399 --> 00:34:25,429
um if you are not one other sites there
will also be methods in the future to

607
00:34:25,429 --> 00:34:25,730
say

608
00:34:25,730 --> 00:34:28,990
HCPs headers just like this trick
transport security at a

609
00:34:28,990 --> 00:34:33,760
to set your public key pence and this is
an enormous foot gone

610
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:37,859
right you can take your site offline for
Chrome Firefox users

611
00:34:37,859 --> 00:34:42,478
forever if you get this wrong um as a as
a little bit terrifying

612
00:34:42,479 --> 00:34:45,399
but we hope we will be supporting the
head i think is already in the the

613
00:34:45,399 --> 00:34:48,768
current promotions we may be supporting
Moxie's tax proposal

614
00:34:48,769 --> 00:34:51,950
which is another way doing the same
thing but for super secure a bonus

615
00:34:51,949 --> 00:34:52,759
points

616
00:34:52,759 --> 00:34:59,759
'em you can do this but do a chest yes
first

617
00:35:00,910 --> 00:35:05,509
next up Dane um I come in what they
stand for

618
00:35:05,509 --> 00:35:09,259
but Dane is the the IETF effort I'm
forgoing

619
00:35:09,259 --> 00:35:13,180
holy crap DNS I got a ploy which do
something with it

620
00:35:13,180 --> 00:35:17,489
I'm for those who don't know DNS records
been going for about 15 years now

621
00:35:17,489 --> 00:35:21,940
in terms of various designs um and then
recently in the past couple years

622
00:35:21,940 --> 00:35:25,049
mostly I think thanks to Dan Kaminsky on

623
00:35:25,049 --> 00:35:30,089
group and a buncha GT Audi is deployed
in a sec which is a way of signing DNS

624
00:35:30,089 --> 00:35:31,538
entries

625
00:35:31,539 --> 00:35:35,269
and Dane is a way of saying well we
should put stuff in DNS which you know

626
00:35:35,269 --> 00:35:35,579
like

627
00:35:35,579 --> 00:35:39,640
certificate fingerprints public giving a
prince so that we can use this

628
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:44,359
trust mechanism %uh Dean a sec is
actually kinda

629
00:35:44,359 --> 00:35:48,058
is very complicated on these computers X
509

630
00:35:48,059 --> 00:35:51,079
is also federated so you know it's

631
00:35:51,079 --> 00:35:54,650
if you get a few key set up for example
to calm it doesn't matter that you have

632
00:35:54,650 --> 00:35:56,319
10,000 host names in court

633
00:35:56,319 --> 00:36:00,249
example.com you have to go to CA in
trying it while carts as a search for

634
00:36:00,249 --> 00:36:00,829
these

635
00:36:00,829 --> 00:36:04,859
it works like DNS does me quite like
that it's also

636
00:36:04,859 --> 00:36:07,979
but time base revocation short if
signatures

637
00:36:07,979 --> 00:36:11,150
maybe I'll get to that later but
short-lived signatures with an awful lot

638
00:36:11,150 --> 00:36:11,859
better than

639
00:36:11,859 --> 00:36:15,489
are x5 and I medication mechanisms so we
quite like the NSX

640
00:36:15,489 --> 00:36:19,369
BK I um and Dane is saying

641
00:36:19,369 --> 00:36:24,339
well we can put hash the certificates in
DNS you can check it with you in a sec

642
00:36:24,339 --> 00:36:29,130
could you trust them which is
interesting because most CA certificates

643
00:36:29,130 --> 00:36:29,749
are what we call

644
00:36:29,749 --> 00:36:32,910
DVD DV two main but I think it's
difficult it's

645
00:36:32,910 --> 00:36:37,259
the CA is saying I I sent an email
system

646
00:36:37,259 --> 00:36:40,549
although I've up I've got to follow his
web server

647
00:36:40,549 --> 00:36:43,950
and he was not much right if that relies
entirely on the NS

648
00:36:43,950 --> 00:36:47,229
if someone can subvert the NS they can
get CA certificates

649
00:36:47,229 --> 00:36:50,930
is not as if by trusting DNS we going
you know we're trusting anymore not

650
00:36:50,930 --> 00:36:52,058
increasing our taxes

651
00:36:52,059 --> 00:36:55,999
service um to this intriguing

652
00:36:55,999 --> 00:37:00,170
the problems being the the instead is
horribly horribly broken we counted in a

653
00:37:00,170 --> 00:37:01,700
secular purpose

654
00:37:01,700 --> 00:37:06,279
I I did a test where we try to do DNS
txt lookups

655
00:37:06,279 --> 00:37:09,749
we get them to sites that we were
connecting to so we've just done a valid

656
00:37:09,749 --> 00:37:10,849
a look up for them

657
00:37:10,849 --> 00:37:14,989
we just connected to them so that
clearly up um and we try to do a txt

658
00:37:14,989 --> 00:37:16,479
look up for that same day

659
00:37:16,479 --> 00:37:19,670
that what we expected a response the or
possibly

660
00:37:19,670 --> 00:37:23,539
appeal response data but mostly response
says no such record

661
00:37:23,539 --> 00:37:27,509
I what we actually get about 3.5 since
the times absolutely nothing

662
00:37:27,509 --> 00:37:31,239
because fire was block anything that's
not a record or maybe a quarterly record

663
00:37:31,239 --> 00:37:32,599
if you're lucky

664
00:37:32,599 --> 00:37:37,299
and 3.5 percent of I don't know what a
current usage numbers of a chrome

665
00:37:37,299 --> 00:37:39,769
hundreds millions 3.5 percent to people

666
00:37:39,769 --> 00:37:43,999
is she knows we love New York states in
terms of number of people that we would

667
00:37:43,999 --> 00:37:45,299
be breaking

668
00:37:45,299 --> 00:37:49,999
if we try to do this sort of thing
because we can't allow its failure is a

669
00:37:49,999 --> 00:37:51,910
security mechanism

670
00:37:51,910 --> 00:37:55,430
has to have failed otherwise the
attacker can simply block it

671
00:37:55,430 --> 00:37:58,999
um and say oh no nothing here on this
completely useless

672
00:37:58,999 --> 00:38:02,739
so so given that is completely
impossible to deploy this

673
00:38:02,739 --> 00:38:06,299
on the modern Internet I'll try to go
for the next best thing

674
00:38:06,299 --> 00:38:09,410
which is in Chrome has been for a while

675
00:38:09,410 --> 00:38:12,569
rather than half the browser to the DNS
lookup

676
00:38:12,569 --> 00:38:15,650
you can take these DNS records which
signed by the in a sec

677
00:38:15,650 --> 00:38:19,489
and you can stick him in a self-signed
certificate there is no visa months

678
00:38:19,489 --> 00:38:21,749
things signs that you have to get them
over poor force

679
00:38:21,749 --> 00:38:25,789
other 453 as long as assigned we can
just check the signatures and we can get

680
00:38:25,789 --> 00:38:29,049
these records any which way as long as
you can get them to us

681
00:38:29,049 --> 00:38:32,430
we can check them validate them trust
them so

682
00:38:32,430 --> 00:38:36,368
I'm at the moment the the record you
need to use some boss attacks up

683
00:38:36,369 --> 00:38:40,559
CA recall which I made up because the
Dane Darcy is currently in the RC

684
00:38:40,559 --> 00:38:42,630
editors cue and has been published yet

685
00:38:42,630 --> 00:38:46,019
once a day now I see is published you
will be able to

686
00:38:46,019 --> 00:38:50,459
with your DNS execute zone %uh saturday
near record

687
00:38:50,459 --> 00:38:54,759
crap the DNS records in their signatures
stick missiles on stiffing give it to

688
00:38:54,759 --> 00:38:56,219
cry when it will be about it

689
00:38:56,219 --> 00:38:59,390
it will be funded by anybody else I'm
not know I can do about that

690
00:38:59,390 --> 00:39:03,430
so this is only really interesting to
either enterprises deployed chrome

691
00:39:03,430 --> 00:39:06,589
largely internally and want to sign

692
00:39:06,589 --> 00:39:09,910
there a hundred thousand desktops in
that court namespace

693
00:39:09,910 --> 00:39:13,009
which now see a scar reach and so forth
they want

694
00:39:13,009 --> 00:39:17,630
give while cars out all these hosts or
if you currently on a site with the

695
00:39:17,630 --> 00:39:20,769
self-signed certificate because fuck the
CA's man for man

696
00:39:20,769 --> 00:39:23,940
we don't pay no one I

697
00:39:23,940 --> 00:39:27,119
which has no filler sites out there then
you can get

698
00:39:27,119 --> 00:39:30,180
against a figure and it will work at
least in chrome and it won't be any

699
00:39:30,180 --> 00:39:30,808
worse

700
00:39:30,809 --> 00:39:33,950
and all the other browsers and what you
have now

701
00:39:33,950 --> 00:39:39,749
on so that was passes for like if the
slides and I have more than enough to is

702
00:39:39,749 --> 00:39:41,690
a problem for the rest of the hour

703
00:39:41,690 --> 00:39:44,779
but is there anyone here who wants me to
talk about something in particular for

704
00:39:44,779 --> 00:39:48,130
example I can talk about sex
transparency I talk about revocation

705
00:39:48,130 --> 00:39:55,130
those are the two big topics are going
to go on about

706
00:39:56,009 --> 00:40:00,339
oh yes okay said to TS 12 um

707
00:40:00,339 --> 00:40:03,589
a long time ago and miss a history there
was a cell b2 when it was crap

708
00:40:03,589 --> 00:40:07,609
and then there's a cell b3 which came
out I don't own a show when

709
00:40:07,609 --> 00:40:11,650
and then the IETF took the protocol and
decided not only to rename it also to

710
00:40:11,650 --> 00:40:12,950
the number it

711
00:40:12,950 --> 00:40:17,160
so then was born 10 s1 so TNS born is in
fact

712
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:20,170
a greater number than three

713
00:40:20,170 --> 00:40:23,979
arm and this a back only had the UI
options

714
00:40:23,979 --> 00:40:27,729
we had to you I options enable SSL 3
enable TLS 1

715
00:40:27,729 --> 00:40:31,269
and when he wanted to be secure a said I
why they want the chamois lenny's

716
00:40:31,269 --> 00:40:32,039
version 3

717
00:40:32,039 --> 00:40:37,920
and they turned off the last one um by
TNS one was published

718
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:41,999
I don't know 2001 eleven years ago also

719
00:40:41,999 --> 00:40:48,069
um hands and since then they've been to
revisions we have 1.1 1.2

720
00:40:48,069 --> 00:40:50,869
which you seem very very different
option because nobody cares too much

721
00:40:50,869 --> 00:40:51,959
about them

722
00:40:51,959 --> 00:40:56,098
I'll be fine he said have a guy with the
firewall problems SLV three verses to

723
00:40:56,099 --> 00:40:57,130
you that's one

724
00:40:57,130 --> 00:41:00,390
butts I thanks to somebody sponsoring

725
00:41:00,390 --> 00:41:04,900
the Opus cell foundation to implement
TLS 1.2 in the least

726
00:41:04,900 --> 00:41:07,979
in the most recent version of SL we are
starting

727
00:41:07,979 --> 00:41:12,630
to see it deploys um we are also is on
the scene deployed

728
00:41:12,630 --> 00:41:16,569
and this may have been the motivation
for whoever paid opens out to do it

729
00:41:16,569 --> 00:41:20,099
because the NSA love something they call
suite B

730
00:41:20,099 --> 00:41:23,650
I sweet a don't get sweet A's what they
reedy ones

731
00:41:23,650 --> 00:41:27,880
but it's classified so sweet be is what
the proletarian guess

732
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:31,529
I and the NSA been pushing for

733
00:41:31,529 --> 00:41:35,029
for over a decade now everyone in the
world to use sweepy

734
00:41:35,029 --> 00:41:39,829
and sweet be although it has a options
for things like our essay that very

735
00:41:39,829 --> 00:41:41,859
clear that they don't like it very much

736
00:41:41,859 --> 00:41:48,209
really what you should be doing is I EC
Dhee CD SAS 120 80 cm

737
00:41:48,209 --> 00:41:53,259
we should have also letters but what it
means is you need here that's 1.2

738
00:41:53,259 --> 00:41:56,390
um so good or service port yes 1.2

739
00:41:56,390 --> 00:41:59,959
an iPhone supported us 1.2 and that was
exciting

740
00:41:59,959 --> 00:42:04,019
because then suddenly all the iPhones in
the world all the iPhone app for talking

741
00:42:04,019 --> 00:42:05,799
to us 1.22 Google

742
00:42:05,799 --> 00:42:10,420
and all the fire was should be built by
muppets over the past decade

743
00:42:10,420 --> 00:42:14,369
which pass a match on the version number
all broke

744
00:42:14,369 --> 00:42:17,459
um ands we

745
00:42:17,459 --> 00:42:22,410
I just about managed to avoid rolling
back one point to support Google

746
00:42:22,410 --> 00:42:26,319
we got a lot of complaints when he goes
out because when the only version 1 it

747
00:42:26,319 --> 00:42:30,650
was fine because all the iPhones nobody
talk want to %uh sweet I'm also go okay

748
00:42:30,650 --> 00:42:32,140
I recognize this

749
00:42:32,140 --> 00:42:34,910
when we vote at one point to study or
the iPhone could talk to us and more

750
00:42:34,910 --> 00:42:37,249
secure man on the five most retail

751
00:42:37,249 --> 00:42:42,150
um and we got a lot of wrong well quite
a lot of pressure to roll it back

752
00:42:42,150 --> 00:42:45,660
but I said well if we hold back then
what is the path for Eva going forward

753
00:42:45,660 --> 00:42:48,269
ever again how is not the end of the
road

754
00:42:48,269 --> 00:42:51,759
um and says it would have been in the
Rose since

755
00:42:51,759 --> 00:42:55,160
if we get rolled it back they would
never be any pressure and no one else in

756
00:42:55,160 --> 00:42:55,729
the world

757
00:42:55,729 --> 00:42:59,719
I was appointed as 1.2 because if we can
pull it off

758
00:42:59,719 --> 00:43:04,569
um so we still to point B still support
1.2 I understand this is cause no

759
00:43:04,569 --> 00:43:08,109
further problems with over 250 vendors
who had to patch the body crap

760
00:43:08,109 --> 00:43:13,509
I'm sorry um

761
00:43:13,509 --> 00:43:17,839
so that happens chrome TLS 1.1

762
00:43:17,839 --> 00:43:21,369
I we have test but one supporting chrome
now

763
00:43:21,369 --> 00:43:24,999
um and we all browsers when they get

764
00:43:24,999 --> 00:43:28,589
any kinda I am handshake ever or
sometimes even the connection reset

765
00:43:28,589 --> 00:43:29,308
would downgrade

766
00:43:29,309 --> 00:43:34,670
SSL v3 because there are its about 1
percent of all servers

767
00:43:34,670 --> 00:43:38,089
cannot duty last version negotiation
they just

768
00:43:38,089 --> 00:43:41,660
they just won't accept even the
negotiation they will simply drop any

769
00:43:41,660 --> 00:43:43,890
connection that is not compatible with
them

770
00:43:43,890 --> 00:43:47,319
SLV 30 absolute baseline we can possibly
do we turn off

771
00:43:47,319 --> 00:43:50,459
widow of a compression widow of rest and
I we don't do any of these things that

772
00:43:50,459 --> 00:43:55,190
combust be free to serve I'm so we've
always had this fall back dresses lv3

773
00:43:55,190 --> 00:44:00,569
on the hope was that at least maybe the
fallback wouldn't get any worse btls 1.1

774
00:44:00,569 --> 00:44:04,519
that does not appear to be the case I'm
afraid not only are we haven't

775
00:44:04,519 --> 00:44:08,650
botched record had a version number only
have a say one

776
00:44:08,650 --> 00:44:11,699
um we are having to add yet another four
back

777
00:44:11,699 --> 00:44:16,229
chrome is never fall back on connection
reset for TLS 1.1 we know it for African

778
00:44:16,229 --> 00:44:18,579
actually sets to get to these files

779
00:44:18,579 --> 00:44:21,769
are so the answer is yes a huge problem

780
00:44:21,769 --> 00:44:27,039
I and while we have these four backs we
can never depend on

781
00:44:27,039 --> 00:44:30,299
we can never depend on any security
feature any future russian TLS

782
00:44:30,299 --> 00:44:34,269
as if the attacker can simply send a
reset I can get us to downgrade the

783
00:44:34,269 --> 00:44:35,130
version

784
00:44:35,130 --> 00:44:40,119
then that's not secure a I is something
has to do something about because

785
00:44:40,119 --> 00:44:43,209
politico 42 curious he doesn't work with
SSL v3

786
00:44:43,209 --> 00:44:47,558
so when you 'cause chrome to downgrade
SLV three or any other browser

787
00:44:47,559 --> 00:44:50,910
for security on Google Website suddenly
switch is off

788
00:44:50,910 --> 00:44:54,430
arm and for entirely personal reasons

789
00:44:54,430 --> 00:44:58,399
I do not want to be IMEI don'ts

790
00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:02,089
go anywhere Toby dodge in the world but
some other employees have had

791
00:45:02,089 --> 00:45:05,609
unfortunate situations where the local
authorities have said we would like to

792
00:45:05,609 --> 00:45:06,920
word do something

793
00:45:06,920 --> 00:45:11,089
and given the I have the private keys a
lot of things a lot of nasty people

794
00:45:11,089 --> 00:45:12,140
would want ido

795
00:45:12,140 --> 00:45:16,390
wants people not to be using 46 I want
to be able to say

796
00:45:16,390 --> 00:45:22,308
at Newport torching me I can't give you
the keys arm

797
00:45:22,309 --> 00:45:25,849
you can't do it to get from left him
talk

798
00:45:25,849 --> 00:45:29,109
now we don't we could switch it on but
some

799
00:45:29,109 --> 00:45:32,910
if the problem is that the we have to
worry about the deed of service

800
00:45:32,910 --> 00:45:36,940
so if we offer to do that it will
produce a $1 K

801
00:45:36,940 --> 00:45:40,150
haven't hellman then if someone de doces
us we have to

802
00:45:40,150 --> 00:45:43,279
now be able to do that um I didn't

803
00:45:43,279 --> 00:45:47,059
I have not got that the operations folks
i think is easier to

804
00:45:47,059 --> 00:45:51,190
to fix our clients to to somehow get
around this version rollback

805
00:45:51,190 --> 00:45:56,549
vans offer that's higher brother yeah
it's possible you're right

806
00:45:56,549 --> 00:46:00,579
along exponentiation is fairly expensive
I'd have to for them something

807
00:46:00,579 --> 00:46:04,509
I have to do enough work to make all the
rest this fast enough such the

808
00:46:04,509 --> 00:46:09,709
the overall speed decrease was not
significant I've got to move cool water

809
00:46:09,709 --> 00:46:13,848
2048 bikinis and that's gonna cost me a
lot of my

810
00:46:13,849 --> 00:46:17,569
goodwill budget when I suddenly drop out
on them

811
00:46:17,569 --> 00:46:20,619
I some might like it will budgets is I

812
00:46:20,619 --> 00:46:25,699
is committed already

813
00:46:25,699 --> 00:46:31,089
yes some very um we I mean I ate believe
the jumps 2048 was to pick

814
00:46:31,089 --> 00:46:34,819
um I worship in smaller but nests have
said

815
00:46:34,819 --> 00:46:38,670
that by the end of 2013 but lightshow be
2048

816
00:46:38,670 --> 00:46:42,849
and given that we have large numbers of
I love this also people who go through

817
00:46:42,849 --> 00:46:45,829
in this guidelines as a do you meet
these

818
00:46:45,829 --> 00:46:49,739
right I'm then we then which up to 2048

819
00:46:49,739 --> 00:46:52,900
I'm okay so

820
00:46:52,900 --> 00:46:55,949
first time I actually prattle on about
educational CT

821
00:46:55,949 --> 00:47:00,539
I've just I just bitch so in the park
last few minutes I shall go on about CT

822
00:47:00,539 --> 00:47:03,979
this is more optimistic um

823
00:47:03,979 --> 00:47:09,219
so keep in mind as I say this II said
all these things about how you shouldn't

824
00:47:09,219 --> 00:47:12,890
worry about CA's because your website
sucks so badly because SSL stripping a

825
00:47:12,890 --> 00:47:14,598
mic scripting and cookies

826
00:47:14,599 --> 00:47:18,239
that you don't even get up to this level
so that's that's something you need to

827
00:47:18,239 --> 00:47:19,680
remember

828
00:47:19,680 --> 00:47:23,799
um but if you do get up to this level
then then you concern yourself with the

829
00:47:23,799 --> 00:47:25,140
fact that there are hundreds

830
00:47:25,140 --> 00:47:28,269
%uh organizations with see a sign in
power

831
00:47:28,269 --> 00:47:31,949
and we don't even know how many there
are because companies occasionally give

832
00:47:31,949 --> 00:47:32,579
it out and

833
00:47:32,579 --> 00:47:35,819
you know therefore thats you very often
give it out don't tell anyone

834
00:47:35,819 --> 00:47:39,190
um the ideas to fix transparency which
is

835
00:47:39,190 --> 00:47:42,589
a proposal put forward by Pan Noi myself
is

836
00:47:42,589 --> 00:47:46,839
a is to be as nice to see as possible
all we want from them as you want to

837
00:47:46,839 --> 00:47:47,339
know

838
00:47:47,339 --> 00:47:50,739
what the hell they're signing we want to
say if you are making it public

839
00:47:50,739 --> 00:47:51,979
assertion

840
00:47:51,979 --> 00:47:55,479
about some website that public
assertions a big public

841
00:47:55,479 --> 00:47:58,709
because new given that's a I

842
00:47:58,709 --> 00:48:02,118
sort of manager deeply involved in
Google serving

843
00:48:02,119 --> 00:48:05,150
I'm not confident I know all see figures
out the issue

844
00:48:05,150 --> 00:48:09,779
cool calm in organization as large as us
we do occasionally have panic so someone

845
00:48:09,779 --> 00:48:12,209
says what the hell is this certificate

846
00:48:12,209 --> 00:48:15,680
and if all goes cheeses Christ where
they come from any official said no it's

847
00:48:15,680 --> 00:48:17,719
this obscure thing don't worry

848
00:48:17,719 --> 00:48:20,949
there is no way even we can't keep track

849
00:48:20,949 --> 00:48:24,380
have all the sex issue for us there is
no way if you are

850
00:48:24,380 --> 00:48:28,999
some smaller sites on and some small CA
issues a certificate for you you never

851
00:48:28,999 --> 00:48:30,369
find out

852
00:48:30,369 --> 00:48:34,599
so we would like to say her or Steph
ickes if a public website should be

853
00:48:34,599 --> 00:48:35,469
public

854
00:48:35,469 --> 00:48:38,689
and therefore if I'm food I'll call my
can say what are all this difficult

855
00:48:38,689 --> 00:48:39,359
issue for food

856
00:48:39,359 --> 00:48:42,420
call and if suddenly something pops up
signed by

857
00:48:42,420 --> 00:48:45,739
did you know to you go whole

858
00:48:45,739 --> 00:48:49,769
weights that interesting I it's only
retroactive and unless it be really nice

859
00:48:49,769 --> 00:48:51,819
to know

860
00:48:51,819 --> 00:48:56,180
so we can implement this using something
called independent data structure

861
00:48:56,180 --> 00:48:59,538
which is a cryptographic thing that we
can we can build recently

862
00:48:59,539 --> 00:49:02,739
if you're a CA we trust you may have to
trust you could be trusted to give

863
00:49:02,739 --> 00:49:03,920
advice if it gets

864
00:49:03,920 --> 00:49:07,670
but depend on a data structure we don't
have to trust you we have the client's

865
00:49:07,670 --> 00:49:11,019
validate the things they seem to have or
minor across checks

866
00:49:11,019 --> 00:49:15,579
auditors to make sure that everything
that you published a is published

867
00:49:15,579 --> 00:49:18,640
I mean make sure the clients don't trust
you think it's not publish this is a

868
00:49:18,640 --> 00:49:20,118
solvable problem

869
00:49:20,119 --> 00:49:24,539
um the major problem is that we need
some way to gets

870
00:49:24,539 --> 00:49:28,289
some proof for publication in a
certificate to the client so that we can

871
00:49:28,289 --> 00:49:29,709
check it

872
00:49:29,709 --> 00:49:33,249
um and we need to do this without
breaking

873
00:49:33,249 --> 00:49:36,640
either most to the client almost the
service in the world because I do those

874
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:37,189
things

875
00:49:37,189 --> 00:49:41,779
makes on deployable the only thing that
we hit a wedge into all the service in

876
00:49:41,779 --> 00:49:43,019
the world says certificate

877
00:49:43,019 --> 00:49:46,349
is the only have configuration all for
the weekend twiddle we can make things

878
00:49:46,349 --> 00:49:48,289
as easy as possible for happens

879
00:49:48,289 --> 00:49:52,099
but if we say you have to upgrade your
server then that's not gonna happen

880
00:49:52,099 --> 00:49:55,239
I get bug reports from people running
service from thirteen years ago

881
00:49:55,239 --> 00:49:58,979
haven't been touched Preet literally for
the last 9 a.m.

882
00:49:58,979 --> 00:50:03,130
um 23 gonna force everyone in the world
to do this we have to do without

883
00:50:03,130 --> 00:50:07,579
them upgrading the server so we set well
can we which something in a certificate

884
00:50:07,579 --> 00:50:09,079
somewhere

885
00:50:09,079 --> 00:50:12,549
and there are two places where you can
have to do this you can look to send

886
00:50:12,549 --> 00:50:13,880
additional certificates

887
00:50:13,880 --> 00:50:18,009
you know bullshit me the certificates
that's up because browsers

888
00:50:18,009 --> 00:50:22,400
you know as I said try to we this path
through this difficult miasma

889
00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:25,589
will ignore and we said oh this

890
00:50:25,589 --> 00:50:29,209
also this one place in certificates the
second track with promises which is a

891
00:50:29,209 --> 00:50:29,880
news

892
00:50:29,880 --> 00:50:33,189
outside the signed area so we can
stuffing you want in that

893
00:50:33,189 --> 00:50:37,078
and I run a couple attests I'm he said
how compatible with clients are these

894
00:50:37,079 --> 00:50:38,390
two things

895
00:50:38,390 --> 00:50:42,439
it turns out my the memory compatible
they break enough clients doing either

896
00:50:42,439 --> 00:50:43,578
these things

897
00:50:43,579 --> 00:50:47,719
that it's kind of a no go so now

898
00:50:47,719 --> 00:50:51,049
ben is talking to CA's and ben is of the
opinion that

899
00:50:51,049 --> 00:50:55,609
week gets %eh to cooperate in this and
put a proof for publication the signed a

900
00:50:55,609 --> 00:50:56,999
revisit effects

901
00:50:56,999 --> 00:51:00,410
and then we can set up these certificate
locks

902
00:51:00,410 --> 00:51:04,160
where you can go when you can say you
know I am boss to figures

903
00:51:04,160 --> 00:51:07,848
exist for food com or you go to some
services has peas and that may have been

904
00:51:07,849 --> 00:51:09,939
used if it appears a few to calm

905
00:51:09,939 --> 00:51:13,189
this would be a significant step up from
where we are now

906
00:51:13,189 --> 00:51:18,420
um ben is still very positive about this
simply to Seattle cooperates

907
00:51:18,420 --> 00:51:22,339
I am perhaps less so um but we're still
going to try

908
00:51:22,339 --> 00:51:25,430
and its we still going to try n

909
00:51:25,430 --> 00:51:28,769
no scare up some publicity and possibly
some support

910
00:51:28,769 --> 00:51:32,319
and possibly some public shaming the
CIA's and I think they'll be at Cooper

911
00:51:32,319 --> 00:51:34,199
security blog post coming

912
00:51:34,199 --> 00:51:38,769
um I think would have happened by now
would not say ones on vacation right now

913
00:51:38,769 --> 00:51:42,579
I'm so that CA and sigh CT and in the
last seven minutes

914
00:51:42,579 --> 00:51:49,579
I'll go for for any more questions

915
00:51:56,910 --> 00:52:00,038
said the question is what about
convergence a convergence is one at

916
00:52:00,039 --> 00:52:00,950
Moxie's projects

917
00:52:00,950 --> 00:52:04,960
um not even though I'm cancelling bash I
say that you know

918
00:52:04,960 --> 00:52:08,930
might not say the power and Moxie does
more work than almost anyone in trying

919
00:52:08,930 --> 00:52:11,450
to do this thing actually writes code I
respect moxie

920
00:52:11,450 --> 00:52:16,829
massively a convergence convergence
involves the browser when verifying

921
00:52:16,829 --> 00:52:19,549
certificate going off in checking with a
buncha people

922
00:52:19,549 --> 00:52:22,869
is is to forget about it do you agree
with this and where

923
00:52:22,869 --> 00:52:26,440
agree is not precise defines in order to
allow some flexibility but it could mean

924
00:52:26,440 --> 00:52:26,799
like

925
00:52:26,799 --> 00:52:31,299
if you make a connection to see the same
one um the problem with this

926
00:52:31,299 --> 00:52:34,920
is a brown says cannot make requests
synchronously when verify it's difficult

927
00:52:34,920 --> 00:52:35,769
to place the world

928
00:52:35,769 --> 00:52:39,680
if you are behind some hotel no captive
portal login

929
00:52:39,680 --> 00:52:42,970
then you have to be able to validate
this difficult without talking to

930
00:52:42,970 --> 00:52:46,049
anybody else the vote that you talk to
anybody else on the comp break every

931
00:52:46,049 --> 00:52:47,400
hotel network in the world

932
00:52:47,400 --> 00:52:50,950
I seconds problem is that these

933
00:52:50,950 --> 00:52:54,989
I he was no trees right these notary
service

934
00:52:54,989 --> 00:52:59,239
let's imagine that we're going to deploy
synchro so we have to pick some notaries

935
00:52:59,239 --> 00:53:02,890
which are going to be contacted every
single time chrome user anywhere far

936
00:53:02,890 --> 00:53:03,848
this is difficult

937
00:53:03,849 --> 00:53:08,619
well that's the ideal slut they'll take
it was anything I given the if they go

938
00:53:08,619 --> 00:53:10,960
down every chrome every US stops working

939
00:53:10,960 --> 00:53:14,019
that we have quite a strong sense to be
wearing them ourselves in fact is the

940
00:53:14,019 --> 00:53:15,380
only option we have 21

941
00:53:15,380 --> 00:53:18,410
ourselves and so convergence turns into
a

942
00:53:18,410 --> 00:53:22,700
chrome phones home too cool to buy the
Everest difficult and it breaks

943
00:53:22,700 --> 00:53:26,089
capture portals us if OKC point of view

944
00:53:26,089 --> 00:53:30,049
the idea chrome front owned by the it
was difficult doesn't fly I

945
00:53:30,049 --> 00:53:34,119
most or everything I built so far my
crew

946
00:53:34,119 --> 00:53:38,460
Google has managed to avoid me carrying
a pager this is very important

947
00:53:38,460 --> 00:53:42,019
anything which involves we have to carry
a pager is kind of a no go

948
00:53:42,019 --> 00:53:46,809
everything so far I can a complete
completely I can wait for days

949
00:53:46,809 --> 00:53:50,160
for days without touching and nothing
will go horribly wrong which means I can

950
00:53:50,160 --> 00:53:51,868
have a long weekend in coming on Monday

951
00:53:51,869 --> 00:53:55,249
arm and so that is also a severe
negative for me

952
00:53:55,249 --> 00:54:02,249
so send a convergence is not something
we've been doing right now

953
00:54:09,540 --> 00:54:13,330
%ah question is how can you how can you
really trust CIA's the answer is a

954
00:54:13,330 --> 00:54:18,790
the you kind of have to because we gonna
be the option rights ESET as I pass

955
00:54:18,790 --> 00:54:19,300
attempt

956
00:54:19,300 --> 00:54:23,360
I'm what we're trying to really tough I
yeah

957
00:54:23,360 --> 00:54:30,360
I sir

958
00:54:37,170 --> 00:54:39,890
asked the question is with publickey
pinning if you say in the head at what

959
00:54:39,890 --> 00:54:41,140
about the the first

960
00:54:41,140 --> 00:54:45,640
know the first one problem by the client
didn't happen the major on trees built

961
00:54:45,640 --> 00:54:46,310
into the browser

962
00:54:46,310 --> 00:54:49,490
otherwise know there was an on so that's
the weakness

963
00:54:49,490 --> 00:54:56,490
all of not building into the router
that's why we go to them show

964
00:54:59,060 --> 00:55:01,049
a client certificates going anywhere

965
00:55:01,050 --> 00:55:08,050
no

966
00:55:18,490 --> 00:55:25,490
yep

967
00:55:30,120 --> 00:55:34,130
so is the problem I would initially PSI
I need to include java script which is

968
00:55:34,130 --> 00:55:35,430
87 racially p

969
00:55:35,430 --> 00:55:38,670
or is it I'm including jobs get from
this at network

970
00:55:38,670 --> 00:55:42,400
and therefore I have to trust them was
both

971
00:55:42,400 --> 00:55:46,860
I consider it so if you want this to be
a sight and you need to include some

972
00:55:46,860 --> 00:55:49,180
javascript save an app that works as an
acceptor

973
00:55:49,180 --> 00:55:52,620
race DP that's a real pain in the
backside I'm sorry I

974
00:55:52,620 --> 00:55:55,700
will given the I

975
00:55:55,700 --> 00:55:58,700
work for an advertising company which
may have been guilty of this at times in

976
00:55:58,700 --> 00:56:01,810
the past I can tell you that there was a
significant contingent the people within

977
00:56:01,810 --> 00:56:02,520
the company

978
00:56:02,520 --> 00:56:06,450
screaming that this is a problem and
things are sold at moving by have

979
00:56:06,450 --> 00:56:07,250
nothing to announce

980
00:56:07,250 --> 00:56:12,290
the second one is the if your niche vs
website and use of JavaScript from this

981
00:56:12,290 --> 00:56:19,290
ad network you are valuable to them yep
yep

982
00:56:20,800 --> 00:56:23,970
I'll

983
00:56:23,970 --> 00:56:30,970
site

984
00:56:34,900 --> 00:56:37,710
are so insecure same way to serve it
doesn't respond to HTP

985
00:56:37,710 --> 00:56:41,820
doesn't actually buy you much because
the attack oh well its acronym that work

986
00:56:41,820 --> 00:56:43,520
on this one thanks to be too short so it
doesn't

987
00:56:43,520 --> 00:56:47,580
what you should do is use your server
301 redirect 301 can be cashed

988
00:56:47,580 --> 00:56:51,190
I so even if you don't have a chest yes
which you should have

989
00:56:51,190 --> 00:56:54,250
if the 301 is casually sure you have a
fighting chance

990
00:56:54,250 --> 00:56:58,270
I began not serving HTP doesn't buy you
anything as far as I know

991
00:56:58,270 --> 00:57:02,250
because the attack fabricated I think
this change was waiting for a while

992
00:57:02,250 --> 00:57:08,670
now he's done um

993
00:57:08,670 --> 00:57:11,690
simply because we update our certain key
so often

994
00:57:11,690 --> 00:57:17,910
I and the simply keeping the old key
around to be one extra place to keep it

995
00:57:17,910 --> 00:57:19,740
in this certificate issuance process

996
00:57:19,740 --> 00:57:23,380
so we don't do it so yes %ah search
rotate very very frequently

997
00:57:23,380 --> 00:57:27,609
and almost in the biweekly basis like
emails from Pigeon users

998
00:57:27,609 --> 00:57:32,098
apparently pigeon fines to the CIMA
members its as as a style

999
00:57:32,099 --> 00:57:35,180
which is kinda resemble it had too much
with the body with Google when we rotate

1000
00:57:35,180 --> 00:57:35,859
every two weeks

1001
00:57:35,859 --> 00:57:39,359
%uh and some on

1002
00:57:39,359 --> 00:57:46,359
okay go

1003
00:57:51,810 --> 00:57:56,960
right the question is why is HTTP why is
badass UPS more scary than a sh t p

1004
00:57:56,960 --> 00:58:00,990
um the ONS a sort of summer is

1005
00:58:00,990 --> 00:58:04,450
is legacy we we can change that much

1006
00:58:04,450 --> 00:58:09,350
um I think the more important answer is
that if you said HTTPS

1007
00:58:09,350 --> 00:58:13,120
the user in some sense or somebody
almost for secure connection with

1008
00:58:13,120 --> 00:58:14,600
failing to provide it to you

1009
00:58:14,600 --> 00:58:19,390
which is more interesting than if you
didn't ask for a secure connection you

1010
00:58:19,390 --> 00:58:20,200
didn't get it

1011
00:58:20,200 --> 00:58:24,560
um yeah I guess that

1012
00:58:24,560 --> 00:58:27,680
that my own safety simply just didn't
decorate

1013
00:58:27,680 --> 00:58:30,940
HTTPS sites then when attacked the kurds

1014
00:58:30,940 --> 00:58:33,960
know the fact that occurred is more
interesting

1015
00:58:33,960 --> 00:58:37,950
um than the benefits have just allow
people 21 self signed cert

1016
00:58:37,950 --> 00:58:41,690
if you need a search good start as a
cell or in a sec

1017
00:58:41,690 --> 00:58:45,350
I think I would much rather making easy
to get certs

1018
00:58:45,350 --> 00:58:49,009
the making easy to use self signed cert
some possibly hurt other things at the

1019
00:58:49,010 --> 00:58:49,540
same time

1020
00:58:49,540 --> 00:58:56,540
shop yeah

1021
00:59:04,430 --> 00:59:08,480
okay on so the question is oh and by the
way I just realized I'm the last person

1022
00:59:08,480 --> 00:59:11,230
in this room so I can keep going for
hours

1023
00:59:11,230 --> 00:59:14,549
so if you want to if you want to run
away

1024
00:59:14,549 --> 00:59:19,038
I I hereby believe any social pressure
that you may feel

1025
00:59:19,039 --> 00:59:22,460
and guilt about standing up and walking
out on

1026
00:59:22,460 --> 00:59:25,789
so the question here was CD ends if I
managed to BS sites

1027
00:59:25,789 --> 00:59:30,559
I and I'm sorting stuff from CD ends the
CDN is not see more not give me a GPS

1028
00:59:30,559 --> 00:59:31,210
service

1029
00:59:31,210 --> 00:59:34,420
I some CD and absolutely will II

1030
00:59:34,420 --> 00:59:37,720
I mean we run our own I'm afraid so i
cant

1031
00:59:37,720 --> 00:59:41,730
right but some say yes absolutely do
when I see them doing ACA my will for

1032
00:59:41,730 --> 00:59:44,440
example how this judge was gonna tell me
I can't go on hours

1033
00:59:44,440 --> 00:59:47,910
yeah so on that is one mention of

1034
00:59:47,910 --> 00:59:50,879
there was a schedule change though some
you heard about it we're going lost film

1035
00:59:50,880 --> 00:59:51,420
fest

1036
00:59:51,420 --> 00:59:55,589
in the second room over there Asman room
are starting now going to closing

1037
00:59:55,589 --> 00:59:56,630
ceremony 7

1038
00:59:56,630 --> 00:59:59,930
closing ceremonies at seven and you're
wrapping up because we have to

1039
00:59:59,930 --> 01:00:03,970
to close up close up the AV but thanks
so much for our own

1040
01:00:03,970 --> 01:00:07,700
to here gay athletes know what you think
other matter to you

1041
01:00:07,700 --> 01:00:11,230
but the eighty guys early standing by
because we're scheduled to practice room

1042
01:00:11,230 --> 01:00:14,690
yeah and a bright I'm K

1043
01:00:14,690 --> 01:00:16,320
the

1044
01:00:16,320 --> 01:00:19,920
I no no I used to be a navy guy resist I
was ever ready for some years

1045
01:00:19,920 --> 01:00:23,130

such a vicious question which we last
won so yes some CD ends will do a steep

1047
01:00:27,380 --> 01:00:29,740
yes you can simply go around but they
might charge you more

1048
01:00:29,740 --> 01:00:34,280
I don't have a good answer for that I
have floated a proposal where we say

1049
01:00:34,280 --> 01:00:37,700
the in the HTTP you can load a resource

1050
01:00:37,700 --> 01:00:41,070
so in in the HTML you can go to be
social grace TP if you provide

1051
01:00:41,070 --> 01:00:44,360
passionate if we can verify it we don't
need to get over SSL

1052
01:00:44,360 --> 01:00:49,320
arm that the problem with that is only
going to be chrome is gonna trigger

1053
01:00:49,320 --> 01:00:53,000
mix catching air as the other browsers
I'm not sure how good idea idea it is

1054
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:57,720
and someone else at work decided to
attack this ID onto a much bigger more

1055
01:00:57,720 --> 01:01:01,970
ambitious I D which will probably sink
and track that down with it um

1056
01:01:01,970 --> 01:01:05,730
so I don't know how it's gonna happen um
yes

1057
01:01:05,730 --> 01:01:08,540
I'm sorry yes CD and you may have to pay
some more but they were absolutely

1058
01:01:08,540 --> 01:01:09,330
separate

1059
01:01:09,330 --> 01:01:11,610
PPS for you right thanks very much lays
in judgment
