1
00:00:03,409 --> 00:00:04,770
my name's Mary Roberson

2
00:00:04,770 --> 00:00:09,269
I'm an anthropologist and

3
00:00:09,269 --> 00:00:14,259
I'm coming out for the very first time
in public I am on the autism spectrum

4
00:00:14,259 --> 00:00:19,000
my friends and family have been telling
me this for years but I fought tooth and

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:19,580
nail

6
00:00:19,580 --> 00:00:23,100
but I really have to admit arm

7
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:27,939
I have many a home be qualifying

8
00:00:27,939 --> 00:00:31,070
characteristics solve which I

9
00:00:31,070 --> 00:00:34,690
referred to in know the write-up about
this

10
00:00:34,690 --> 00:00:38,930
on talk in the program book so you can
take a look at that if you haven't

11
00:00:38,930 --> 00:00:39,719
already

12
00:00:39,719 --> 00:00:43,420
and I would like you to take a look at
it

13
00:00:43,420 --> 00:00:47,940
end make some realistic assessments on
yourself

14
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:54,379
because it is mine a hypothesis that as
many as 95 percent of the people it hope

15
00:00:54,379 --> 00:01:01,379
are on the autism spectrum by and so if
you think you're one of us well

16
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:07,049
congratulations we're the majority year

17
00:01:07,049 --> 00:01:10,119
we're the ones

18
00:01:10,119 --> 00:01:13,740
that the world thinks may be dangerous

19
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:18,990
certainly suspect it's nice to be normal

20
00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:22,149
amongst our own peers

21
00:01:22,150 --> 00:01:25,460
soul

22
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:29,009
there's a difference between formal
diagnosis and

23
00:01:29,009 --> 00:01:32,970
in formal diagnosis and so you know your
own assessment of yourself

24
00:01:32,970 --> 00:01:36,539
is obviously in formal diagnosis the
diagnosed

25
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:40,619
the diagnostic criteria are currently
influx

26
00:01:40,619 --> 00:01:43,630
with on the DSM 5

27
00:01:43,630 --> 00:01:48,000
about to come out people at Hope

28
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,229
are probably more likely to have been
described as having

29
00:01:51,229 --> 00:01:54,630
Aspergers Syndrome well in the dsm-5

30
00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:57,759
there really isn't a separate category

31
00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:01,369
I love Aspergers Syndrome anymore were
all

32
00:02:01,369 --> 00:02:07,680
autism spectrum it's a difference the
kind of makes no difference because

33
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:11,739
the latest on studies which were
actually out as a

34
00:02:11,739 --> 00:02:15,060
yesterday suggest that the dsm-5

35
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:18,930
is gonna diagnose more people than the
DSM for did

36
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:25,720
and that's a good thing okay so some of
the things that you might have

37
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:30,200
and in I'll tell you which ones I have I
am face blind

38
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:33,580
that is you know I've got friends in the
front row

39
00:02:33,580 --> 00:02:36,910
and they have to tell me who they are
when they come up to me

40
00:02:36,910 --> 00:02:41,060
every single time because I recognize
them

41
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:44,160
pack the kid on the end is my son

42
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:51,160
and I can't tell you what he looks like
there are degrees a face blindness and

43
00:02:52,370 --> 00:02:55,379
I'm not too bad because when I actually
see him

44
00:02:55,379 --> 00:02:59,040
I recognize him I just can't tell you
who what he looks like

45
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:05,239
when I'm not looking at him people on
the spectrum have issues with social

46
00:03:05,239 --> 00:03:06,340
cues

47
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:10,260
moved here body language

48
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:13,890
you have problems reading other people's
body language

49
00:03:13,890 --> 00:03:17,950
I don't think anyone here has their

50
00:03:17,950 --> 00:03:24,310
no no no no or facial expressions all my
god what a facial expressions mean

51
00:03:24,310 --> 00:03:27,430
sensory differences

52
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:31,459
I have fairly acute hearing which is why

53
00:03:31,459 --> 00:03:34,640
being in Broom's like this kinda drives
me nuts

54
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:38,500
because the echoes are driving me wild
on

55
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:42,330
I have perfect pitch I can't stand going
to concerts

56
00:03:42,330 --> 00:03:49,330
because no one sings on key I use to
hear burglar alarms and motion detectors

57
00:03:49,879 --> 00:03:51,629
I don't anymore

58
00:03:51,629 --> 00:03:55,209
one of the advantages are getting older
as the to lose some of their high

59
00:03:55,209 --> 00:03:56,319
frequencies

60
00:03:56,319 --> 00:04:02,920
and all gone I'm glad it's gone I
couldn't go into my stop and shop

61
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:05,189
because I could hear their motion
detectors

62
00:04:05,189 --> 00:04:12,189
and it felt like my eyeballs were gonna
pop outta my head monotone voice

63
00:04:12,810 --> 00:04:17,019
well I don't think I do that quite as
much as some people

64
00:04:17,019 --> 00:04:21,298
but many people on the spectrum have a
monotone voice

65
00:04:21,298 --> 00:04:25,280
or don't really express

66
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:28,850
you know use fake facial expressions
appropriately I mean

67
00:04:28,850 --> 00:04:33,699
when something bad happens to you get a
big ass grin

68
00:04:33,699 --> 00:04:38,220
I know I do sometimes arm

69
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:42,690
I contact d either never look people in
the eye

70
00:04:42,690 --> 00:04:48,979
or look at them in the eye so much that
they get scared

71
00:04:48,979 --> 00:04:53,449
so if you feel like these things

72
00:04:53,449 --> 00:04:58,139
describe you well welcome

73
00:04:58,139 --> 00:05:01,810
there's a whole on

74
00:05:01,810 --> 00:05:04,860
debate about whether being on the
spectrum

75
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:08,660
is a disability or just a difference

76
00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:11,669
and I tend to lean towards it's a
difference

77
00:05:11,669 --> 00:05:15,479
and it's a difference that is often an
advantage

78
00:05:15,479 --> 00:05:19,050
i sat down and worked for you know three
weeks

79
00:05:19,050 --> 00:05:23,120
with very little sleep in order to
finish a project and been really happy

80
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:25,669
that I was doing at the entire time

81
00:05:25,669 --> 00:05:28,830
that's an advantage and get I'm get crap
done

82
00:05:28,830 --> 00:05:35,830
really fast

83
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:39,940
people on the spectrum appear to have a
very significant difference in the

84
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:41,840
wiring of their brains

85
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:44,370
I'm gonna let other people talk about
that because I feel like I've been

86
00:05:44,370 --> 00:05:45,400
talking

87
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:48,949
not arm getting close to talk talking
enough at this point

88
00:05:48,949 --> 00:05:52,060
arm but i wanna I'm just wanna throw
some things out there so the other

89
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:54,669
things that go along with being on the
spectrum there were things like

90
00:05:54,669 --> 00:05:55,880
depression

91
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:59,430
because if you've been a weirdo your
entire life

92
00:05:59,430 --> 00:06:04,110
damn it you should be depressed at times

93
00:06:04,110 --> 00:06:09,160
on so on kinda setting up for you what
it means

94
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:13,699
to be on the spectrum my personal
experience

95
00:06:13,699 --> 00:06:19,490
i has been very unwilling to let my son
talk about why

96
00:06:19,490 --> 00:06:23,380
the ATF came raided my house

97
00:06:23,380 --> 00:06:26,530
because %uh here's autistic

98
00:06:26,530 --> 00:06:31,970
interests

99
00:06:31,970 --> 00:06:36,319
but Alex is gonna talk first

100
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:39,600
okay on hi I'm Alex

101
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:42,930
om I'm just I'd like to get a raise our
hands

102
00:06:42,930 --> 00:06:46,840
from are from anyone in this room with
people who are

103
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:51,449
sorta have have a specific obsessive
interest about maybe something technical

104
00:06:51,449 --> 00:06:55,800
are maybe have had issues CL
communicating with people

105
00:06:55,800 --> 00:07:00,090
might seem okay that seems like a really
low number come on guys

106
00:07:00,090 --> 00:07:04,500
selesai at their house some people are
like this hasn't needed

107
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:09,199
raising my hand I'm hopefully soon
people feel more comfortable doing that

108
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:09,940
because it's

109
00:07:09,940 --> 00:07:13,139
because what Mary said is right it's not
a

110
00:07:13,139 --> 00:07:16,530
a bad thing it's there's no that I don't
think there should be a value judgment

111
00:07:16,530 --> 00:07:17,220
when you when he's

112
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:20,449
when you hear about it because it does
just described a very specific subset of

113
00:07:20,449 --> 00:07:21,259
people

114
00:07:21,259 --> 00:07:24,650
and I am one of those people and i
actually

115
00:07:24,650 --> 00:07:28,440
learned about this when I was nine and I
was one of those kids who would

116
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:31,710
obsessively like a look through every
single file that my parents had

117
00:07:31,710 --> 00:07:34,910
you know in their drawers in like just
read stuff in and

118
00:07:34,910 --> 00:07:39,319
getting too much information and iraq
was reading one day and said oh he has

119
00:07:39,319 --> 00:07:44,779
Aspergers Syndrome and I went up to my
moms like with aspirations she's like a

120
00:07:44,779 --> 00:07:49,110
and she's like well you have it that
label at the house I when you tell me

121
00:07:49,110 --> 00:07:52,139
I as is ridiculous com

122
00:07:52,139 --> 00:07:55,369
and I was like in the housing and I
don't have it that's that's stupid

123
00:07:55,369 --> 00:07:58,409
I don't have anything wrong with me and
I didn't have anything wrong even at the

124
00:07:58,409 --> 00:07:58,779
time

125
00:07:58,779 --> 00:08:02,389
hearing like a the word disorder you
assume that there's and when I was

126
00:08:02,389 --> 00:08:05,589
a teenager arm there is no I didn't know
anyone

127
00:08:05,589 --> 00:08:09,059
with artist my didn't know anyone else
who has now it seems like everyone I

128
00:08:09,059 --> 00:08:10,599
meet have happen have it

129
00:08:10,599 --> 00:08:13,529
you know I just noticed that I guess
maybe a better picking it up and I used

130
00:08:13,529 --> 00:08:14,139
to be but

131
00:08:14,139 --> 00:08:17,519
what I did is I went online to try to
find France

132
00:08:17,519 --> 00:08:20,860
and did oddly enough you would think
that

133
00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:25,909
the Internet would be filled with you
know sites for Aspergers and autism in

134
00:08:25,909 --> 00:08:28,989
because mostly people who are spending
everything on waking am

135
00:08:28,989 --> 00:08:32,860
their life on the Internet generally
aren't going out socially in

136
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:36,419
one-on-one situations talking to people
in face in

137
00:08:36,419 --> 00:08:40,188
face in person I guess that that makes
kinda

138
00:08:40,188 --> 00:08:43,929
a lot of sense anyway so what I did as I
decided at to start a website for people

139
00:08:43,930 --> 00:08:44,680
with autism

140
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:47,759
to start a place where people like any
other people like myself

141
00:08:47,759 --> 00:08:52,230
us and I did I I had a friend that I had
met on

142
00:08:52,230 --> 00:08:55,720
a smaller little website for autism and
we decided that we would make it

143
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:56,680
together in to lead

144
00:08:56,680 --> 00:09:00,809
we developed in we we launched in within
a few days

145
00:09:00,809 --> 00:09:04,600
there's you know a few hundred people so
clearly there is and by the way the wes

146
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:06,000
is called wrong planet dotnet

147
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:10,160
few if you wanna check it out arm but
when we started there is

148
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:14,139
few hundred people to join in the first
day in apparently there is a

149
00:09:14,139 --> 00:09:17,399
buzz at Carnegie Mellon Asset my friend
said he went there is a %uh there's a

150
00:09:17,399 --> 00:09:20,180
lot of buzz about your website at
Carnegie Mellon Arena signing a

151
00:09:20,180 --> 00:09:24,839
now and that makes kinda makes sense I
guess I'm but anyway

152
00:09:24,839 --> 00:09:28,930
what happened is a now we have more than
70,000 members and we get

153
00:09:28,930 --> 00:09:33,990
millions that its cell million hits per
day is when

154
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:37,059
my web hosting company president said
he's right there actually

155
00:09:37,059 --> 00:09:40,550
now should anyway on

156
00:09:40,550 --> 00:09:43,879
what what what what can you do on their
basically

157
00:09:43,879 --> 00:09:48,819
a lotta times people like us we have
issues with social skills

158
00:09:48,819 --> 00:09:53,800
and a lot of people delotta geeks have
had trouble fitting and we can't find

159
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:57,079
friends a lot of times are the only
friends we do have are the ones who

160
00:09:57,079 --> 00:09:58,500
share our special interests

161
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:01,790
well this is a great way to illegal
connect with people who are have similar

162
00:10:01,790 --> 00:10:02,509
interests

163
00:10:02,509 --> 00:10:06,329
when I was younger I I had weird
obsessive interests I would

164
00:10:06,329 --> 00:10:09,679
break parole in right coalition

165
00:10:09,679 --> 00:10:13,089
edit Wikipedia I added more than 10,000
Wikipedia articles and yet I still

166
00:10:13,089 --> 00:10:14,939
didn't do any homework in school

167
00:10:14,939 --> 00:10:20,250
sigh I don't know all is going on there
I'll but that's that's kinda just what

168
00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:21,970
happens you end up doing

169
00:10:21,970 --> 00:10:25,910
something that you're obsessively
interested in you everything else gets

170
00:10:25,910 --> 00:10:28,420
taken away and the thing about that is
that a good thing

171
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:32,589
in a way I mean how many you guys have
has spent days and days working on a

172
00:10:32,589 --> 00:10:34,769
project and people want me to come and
you don't

173
00:10:34,769 --> 00:10:38,040
ya go out young young do anything you
just working on your

174
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:42,240
on you think someone raised their hands
write their ego that a lot of people

175
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:46,290
arm and that is where makes a geek to
geek I think you know that having that

176
00:10:46,290 --> 00:10:49,110
that interest that drive that separates
you from other people who just sort of

177
00:10:49,110 --> 00:10:49,779
goal

178
00:10:49,779 --> 00:10:53,790
go about their way in in just her float
float by in life they don't really

179
00:10:53,790 --> 00:10:57,399
focus on one thing and there's something
to be said about both types

180
00:10:57,399 --> 00:10:58,420
personalities

181
00:10:58,420 --> 00:11:01,529
they're both necessary but I personally
prefer the 1i have

182
00:11:01,529 --> 00:11:06,490
and I'm sure you guys seated and I just
wanted to also add that there are a lot

183
00:11:06,490 --> 00:11:08,490
of geeks that are on the spectrum in

184
00:11:08,490 --> 00:11:13,250
serve spoken about it com and my friend
Graeme Colin he created the time he is

185
00:11:13,250 --> 00:11:16,480
actually what's funny is that we I
interviewed him

186
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:19,879
the first time I interviewed him on IRC
or something and and I close it

187
00:11:19,879 --> 00:11:24,290
it got post the slasher I my interview
with him and thousands and thousands of

188
00:11:24,290 --> 00:11:25,990
people signed up for the site after that

189
00:11:25,990 --> 00:11:30,170
and that just goes to show that there's
big overlap in the community

190
00:11:30,170 --> 00:11:35,878
geeks om and people inspect what's funny
is that we are also mentioned in your

191
00:11:35,879 --> 00:11:39,019
time zone of and a front page article
our site and

192
00:11:39,019 --> 00:11:43,519
less people signed up from that because
the general public reason your time

193
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:45,279
zendik streets last at so that's

194
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:48,050
and I bet you more people read the
article in the New York Times so a

195
00:11:48,050 --> 00:11:48,809
discussion

196
00:11:48,809 --> 00:11:52,219
%um an donna is that they might

197
00:11:52,220 --> 00:11:55,300
is my time at communal on a message i
text

198
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:59,529
too long lol so Craig from Craigslist
has on autism spectrum as well

199
00:11:59,529 --> 00:12:02,699
as some other people and I'm not gonna
name because they haven't

200
00:12:02,699 --> 00:12:06,510
the LSU analyst whole let's last year
okay so

201
00:12:06,510 --> 00:12:11,010
are my name is cursed in and I've been
can take notice things I wanna feel em

202
00:12:11,010 --> 00:12:14,459
suffer size wanna say a list of famous
people you've probably heard oh who

203
00:12:14,459 --> 00:12:18,260
are on the autism spectrum or were on
Nikola Tesla who is obsessed with

204
00:12:18,260 --> 00:12:19,199
pigeons

205
00:12:19,199 --> 00:12:22,779
I am sign Craig from Craigslist as Alex
said Mark Zuckerberg

206
00:12:22,779 --> 00:12:26,399
though we might may or may not like him
and czar Bill Gates

207
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:30,829
who is seen on YouTube videos rocking
back and forth the cafes

208
00:12:30,829 --> 00:12:35,139
arms so I some other signs above

209
00:12:35,139 --> 00:12:38,709
signs and traits and autism that Mary
discussed that I wanted to kinda

210
00:12:38,709 --> 00:12:42,230
further our talk about are Meiji

211
00:12:42,230 --> 00:12:46,230
Ashley's she its that are anyway

212
00:12:46,230 --> 00:12:49,370
that out because a lot of these DSM
traits are things that

213
00:12:49,370 --> 00:12:53,740
I I wasn't diagnosed until I was 19
because I sought out my own diagnosis

214
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:56,679
because I finally decided like okay it
must be this

215
00:12:56,679 --> 00:12:59,720
can't be something else I'm not broken
there's a reason for all these things I

216
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:00,459
do

217
00:13:00,459 --> 00:13:04,490
because the DSM lists things that you
might not realize you have

218
00:13:04,490 --> 00:13:08,130
because your own experiences eurozone is
your only experience

219
00:13:08,130 --> 00:13:12,089
and so for example sensory differences
like mary was talking about sound

220
00:13:12,089 --> 00:13:13,079
sensitivity

221
00:13:13,079 --> 00:13:16,189
the you might not realize you have
sensory differences the

222
00:13:16,189 --> 00:13:19,480
arm Stephen Shore on relatively
well-known autism

223
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:24,240
speaker talks about the classic autism
sign is wearing a hat wherever you go

224
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:28,500
to protect against overhead lights and
our

225
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:31,549
and that I didn't notice I had sensory
differences

226
00:13:31,549 --> 00:13:34,750
all I knew is that when my friends put
on music and turn up the stereo

227
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:37,380
right away it scared the crap outta me
and they made fun to me because they

228
00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:39,439
didn't realize why I was so scared

229
00:13:39,439 --> 00:13:42,980
and that I have to wear sunglasses to
drive at night because the lights are so

230
00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:43,370
bright

231
00:13:43,370 --> 00:13:46,750
right here I have halos this big around
all these lights so I can see most

232
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:50,389
the audience but our also stemming

233
00:13:50,389 --> 00:13:53,809
which is short for self stimulation to
something everybody doesn't hurt to

234
00:13:53,809 --> 00:13:55,069
pickles do it if you were gonna

235
00:13:55,069 --> 00:14:00,230
messy there he has is normal he got like
this art world your hair whenever

236
00:14:00,230 --> 00:14:04,490
but that specifically hand flapping and
rocking back and forth and

237
00:14:04,490 --> 00:14:08,079
when I was in elementary school I did
this all the time and and was made fun

238
00:14:08,079 --> 00:14:11,350
of it didn't realize why and why did in
the mirror once and decided to stop

239
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:12,600
doing it in public

240
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:15,970
by

241
00:14:15,970 --> 00:14:19,579
that a lot of these things we don't
notice that ourselves I didn't realize I

242
00:14:19,579 --> 00:14:21,519
had a relatively monotone voice

243
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:25,509
in till an ex boyfriend of mine pointed
out like why don't you use inflection

244
00:14:25,509 --> 00:14:28,529
you should use inflections he taught me
to talk like this

245
00:14:28,529 --> 00:14:31,860
and I should smile will I talk to the
people know that I liked them so I don't

246
00:14:31,860 --> 00:14:33,360
look really angry all the time

247
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:37,319
and I and also a lotta lotta a common
thing with autism is not being able to

248
00:14:37,319 --> 00:14:38,429
pay attention your face

249
00:14:38,429 --> 00:14:41,899
how often if you click on like this in
public and not realize you're sticking

250
00:14:41,899 --> 00:14:42,639
this debate

251
00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:46,689
ever and you relax your face hurts and
ok got how long I've been doing that

252
00:14:46,689 --> 00:14:50,559
and that measly little things you don't
realize as you can see yourself

253
00:14:50,559 --> 00:14:55,929
by I and that I says another thing I did
never realize I didn't make eye contact

254
00:14:55,929 --> 00:14:56,529
because

255
00:14:56,529 --> 00:14:59,579
I didn't make eye contact so I didn't
notice other people were trying to make

256
00:14:59,579 --> 00:15:01,110
eye contact with me

257
00:15:01,110 --> 00:15:04,910
and so I i've I've now that I know this
I've been able to differentiate its

258
00:15:04,910 --> 00:15:07,919
really interesting reading books by your
typical authors

259
00:15:07,919 --> 00:15:11,179
I'm come across authors who say they are

260
00:15:11,179 --> 00:15:14,539
dark-haired it doesn't look in the eye
so frustrating when people don't look

261
00:15:14,539 --> 00:15:16,990
you in the eye cuz you can't tell what
they're thinking

262
00:15:16,990 --> 00:15:20,759
and oh I wish she would look me in the
eye so I knew what she was thinking and

263
00:15:20,759 --> 00:15:24,579
and you have your ever read all I I saw
that expression I've lost in his eyes

264
00:15:24,579 --> 00:15:27,039
and things like that what does that even
mean

265
00:15:27,039 --> 00:15:30,289
how do you know what someone is thinking
by looking at their eyes how you read

266
00:15:30,289 --> 00:15:32,100
minds nerd pickles are mind readers

267
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:36,610
seems but and all these little things
that a lot of us don't even notice

268
00:15:36,610 --> 00:15:40,919
until someone else tells us like for
example my favorite is there

269
00:15:40,919 --> 00:15:44,419
when someone says hi how are you you
don't say good they're not ask you a

270
00:15:44,419 --> 00:15:45,009
question

271
00:15:45,009 --> 00:15:48,759
use a good how are you if you don't ask
them how they are back it's brewed

272
00:15:48,759 --> 00:15:52,370
apparently by 7 also if you're not

273
00:15:52,370 --> 00:15:56,179
sure about the DSM criteria I recommend
wrong planet not only for the social

274
00:15:56,179 --> 00:15:57,399
skills aspect because

275
00:15:57,399 --> 00:16:00,660
but because a lot of the forms are
filled with people saying I do this

276
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:04,620
is this autistic is this normal and
people talk about all the different

277
00:16:04,620 --> 00:16:06,059
rates that they share

278
00:16:06,059 --> 00:16:09,899
and cuz you might be totally sound
sensitive or you might not even notice

279
00:16:09,899 --> 00:16:12,130
sounds people have to call your name
three times

280
00:16:12,130 --> 00:16:15,339
and people tend to be on different sides
extremes

281
00:16:15,339 --> 00:16:18,819
you might love spinning around and chill
your sex or you might get sick

282
00:16:18,819 --> 00:16:20,949
immediately as soon as you sit on a
swing

283
00:16:20,949 --> 00:16:24,220
and then everybody's different even on
26 when all

284
00:16:24,220 --> 00:16:27,339
among with the group and and how long
have been to

285
00:16:27,339 --> 00:16:30,850
doing a so

286
00:16:30,850 --> 00:16:35,369
i'm Jack and as mother said

287
00:16:35,369 --> 00:16:38,989
back sup arm

288
00:16:38,989 --> 00:16:42,079
I had a obsessive interest that got me
in trouble

289
00:16:42,079 --> 00:16:46,239
and this is something that probably
doesn't my interest doesn't quite apply

290
00:16:46,239 --> 00:16:46,999
to you guys

291
00:16:46,999 --> 00:16:50,069
quite so much but you know there are
plenty explain examples

292
00:16:50,069 --> 00:16:52,949
I love you know people who are
interested in networking or programming

293
00:16:52,949 --> 00:16:55,300
or whatever and they wind up getting in
legal trouble

294
00:16:55,300 --> 00:16:59,800
not really intentionally and in my case
I was really interested in chemistry and

295
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:00,639
I would spend

296
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:05,089
you know every hour every day when I
wasn't in school

297
00:17:05,089 --> 00:17:08,809
and sometimes I was in school reading on
forums teaching myself about the

298
00:17:08,809 --> 00:17:12,099
chemistry a specifically explosives

299
00:17:12,100 --> 00:17:16,679
Hans and I i tom is a haul ass

300
00:17:16,679 --> 00:17:21,429
you know armed is of these forums and

301
00:17:21,429 --> 00:17:26,369
his/her bit me in the ass hun but I
didn't really think that it with that it

302
00:17:26,368 --> 00:17:26,928
was

303
00:17:26,929 --> 00:17:30,040
confusing why I was doing it there you
know I was doing all this because I was

304
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:31,570
interested in it was cool

305
00:17:31,570 --> 00:17:35,879
you know that there is there was never
any the the social implications what I

306
00:17:35,879 --> 00:17:37,700
was doing didn't really occur to me

307
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:40,760
and so you know when I when I got in

308
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:43,940
when the ATF came to talk to me I'm

309
00:17:43,940 --> 00:17:46,669
I thought that they of course they know
what I'm doing you know I'm just

310
00:17:46,669 --> 00:17:47,559
experimenting

311
00:17:47,559 --> 00:17:51,619
wire--the bothering me I'm and the you
know they thought that I was liking

312
00:17:51,619 --> 00:17:53,158
Obama school or something

313
00:17:53,159 --> 00:17:56,260
so you know I had to defuse them but

314
00:17:56,260 --> 00:18:00,520
thats or a bomb nabbed

315
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:03,790
yeah but that not

316
00:18:03,790 --> 00:18:07,389
yelling the social implications on your
actions

317
00:18:07,389 --> 00:18:10,700
is something that happens a lot of
people on spectrum

318
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:14,869
and on any note maybe not specifically
interest in chemistry but

319
00:18:14,869 --> 00:18:18,959
you know this pattern are spending hours
and hours and hours to studying whatever

320
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:21,710
it is that you're interested in
practicing governors

321
00:18:21,710 --> 00:18:24,730
on and getting really good at it is
something that

322
00:18:24,730 --> 00:18:28,659
applies to you also urged upon spectrum
on so

323
00:18:28,659 --> 00:18:31,290
you know and not all and not all the
people who have these obsessive

324
00:18:31,290 --> 00:18:32,850
interests are like nerds per se

325
00:18:32,850 --> 00:18:36,010
you know some interests are technical
like I had chemistry in

326
00:18:36,010 --> 00:18:39,169
on people here our electronics or
software something like that

327
00:18:39,169 --> 00:18:42,470
but you know there there's other people
that are but really into history

328
00:18:42,470 --> 00:18:45,740
really industry in Italy everything
about world war two tanks

329
00:18:45,740 --> 00:18:49,629
or something like that or trains are you
know your My Little Pony or something

330
00:18:49,629 --> 00:18:52,850
yeah that not all the interests are
virtually

331
00:18:52,850 --> 00:18:56,460
is commercially capital as the classical
nerds

332
00:18:56,460 --> 00:19:01,510
by arm yeah it's it's just a a common
theme

333
00:19:01,510 --> 00:19:05,220
cell well I want I want to point out

334
00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:10,299
bit reactions chemical reactions can be
beautiful

335
00:19:10,299 --> 00:19:14,299
and I think that was you know what you
want what you were heading headed for

336
00:19:14,299 --> 00:19:17,990
I actually then wanted to pick up on
something that cursed and said

337
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:21,879
about not looking people in the eye
because I don't do it either

338
00:19:21,879 --> 00:19:25,010
and he is money hypothesis that you

339
00:19:25,010 --> 00:19:32,010
shouldn't look people in the eye because
they can steal your soul

340
00:19:32,549 --> 00:19:35,889
hi I I used to AC never look anyone in
the eye

341
00:19:35,889 --> 00:19:39,609
and oh what happened is I guess I just
realized that

342
00:19:39,609 --> 00:19:42,790
in some situations good look people in
the eye out for instance

343
00:19:42,790 --> 00:19:46,210
I wanted to get a job you know in it.

344
00:19:46,210 --> 00:19:50,500
com so I look that recruiter and their
cruiser isn't technical at all she

345
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:54,440
you know some person that doesn't really
know much about computers or whatever

346
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:58,409
cell you really need actually wear over
with your personality as well if you

347
00:19:58,409 --> 00:19:59,820
want the job

348
00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:03,980
cell I would I had to learn these things
and a lot of people can learn these

349
00:20:03,980 --> 00:20:06,510
things you think that'll I'm just this
way

350
00:20:06,510 --> 00:20:10,070
you change so saying that'll I used to
be this way

351
00:20:10,070 --> 00:20:13,178
is also an indication an inspection even
if you think now you any

352
00:20:13,179 --> 00:20:16,639
be considered you really still are has
your competency

353
00:20:16,639 --> 00:20:21,260
seller yeah I I'd like to add to that
that a lot of women especially get

354
00:20:21,260 --> 00:20:24,100
late-life diagnoses are never get
diagnosed because

355
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:27,609
are Tony Abbott has a lot of large about
his mother hen friends the way

356
00:20:27,609 --> 00:20:31,480
girls are socialized early in life women
learn to compensate no way that man

357
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:35,139
are not forced to and so by the time
women learn what autism is they don't

358
00:20:35,139 --> 00:20:36,750
always fit the criteria because

359
00:20:36,750 --> 00:20:39,919
I can read by like which I can repay
some special I can make my voice sound

360
00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:42,049
like an all persons waz I want to

361
00:20:42,049 --> 00:20:46,290
and but this is all stuff I've learned
that think the difference is autism is

362
00:20:46,290 --> 00:20:48,109
this stuff doesn't come naturally

363
00:20:48,109 --> 00:20:51,699
and so I spent a long time memorizing
body language dictionaries when someone

364
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:54,600
is interested in someone in the group
they point their feet towards them

365
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:58,190
let someone is not interested what
they're saying in or what you're saying

366
00:20:58,190 --> 00:21:00,970
they reply with one word answers and
look away and that search you to stop

367
00:21:00,970 --> 00:21:02,799
monologue about my little pony:

368
00:21:02,799 --> 00:21:08,929
and that so a lot of these things that
autistic people don't necessarily

369
00:21:08,929 --> 00:21:13,309
have these social skills innately but it
doesn't mean that word like disabled for

370
00:21:13,309 --> 00:21:15,500
life for crippled or anything that we
can learn them

371
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:19,619
if we put our minds to an interview and
now are like me and take body language

372
00:21:19,619 --> 00:21:21,000
to a special interest even

373
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:25,119
get together go to shell out from what
I've seen a lot other reason that

374
00:21:25,119 --> 00:21:28,379
I think that you see a lot of people in
this community being that its social

375
00:21:28,379 --> 00:21:31,190
engineering is because those are people
whose have studied this tape

376
00:21:31,190 --> 00:21:33,790
they've looked at the actions that
people do when they have an

377
00:21:33,790 --> 00:21:36,510
understanding a cognitive understanding
of

378
00:21:36,510 --> 00:21:40,070
how social stuff works where's people
who have an easy day

379
00:21:40,070 --> 00:21:43,879
it's just natural for them they just
feel things to me they see things in

380
00:21:43,879 --> 00:21:47,149
certain things make them feel a certain
way so they can't

381
00:21:47,149 --> 00:21:49,530
they might not be as good at social
engineering I'm not sure that is the

382
00:21:49,530 --> 00:21:51,340
hypothesis has no scientific bat

383
00:21:51,340 --> 00:21:55,270
basis own yeah I have found that what's
really interesting is that

384
00:21:55,270 --> 00:21:58,990
autistic people who put their minds to
learning social skills can often be

385
00:21:58,990 --> 00:22:01,799
better at say cold reading social
engineering

386
00:22:01,799 --> 00:22:04,960
then articles because if it comes
naturally you you don't think twice

387
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:05,919
about why

388
00:22:05,919 --> 00:22:09,570
something is what it is and so for
example you asking her to pick a person

389
00:22:09,570 --> 00:22:13,500
was that girl into me like yeah yeah she
she really liked you

390
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:17,679
my why how do you know I don't know she
she just did not azerbaijan

391
00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:20,780
but not that five and that if you learn
oh well

392
00:22:20,780 --> 00:22:24,178
she was leaning forward she put her body
out on the table towards you she was

393
00:22:24,179 --> 00:22:26,809
looking you in the eye she was playing
with her hair and preening

394
00:22:26,809 --> 00:22:30,059
and like et cetera et cetera you can
learn what learning looks like

395
00:22:30,059 --> 00:22:34,440
literally and that it can help the help
I can get better at this than your

396
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:35,030
typical

397
00:22:35,030 --> 00:22:38,100
and backed I have done a syria that
their

398
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:41,600
UCLA has a center called that their help
group in her the

399
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:44,990
appears program they actually study
social engineering and error not social

400
00:22:44,990 --> 00:22:47,260
engineer social skills and body language
anne

401
00:22:47,260 --> 00:22:51,429
they teach kids up with autism like at a
learning and I did a little video

402
00:22:51,429 --> 00:22:55,399
love me flirting with a girl at the
doctors office in the ass candidates oh

403
00:22:55,399 --> 00:22:58,990
and there's little tutorial on there as
well

404
00:22:58,990 --> 00:23:03,240
and I wanna point out to you that if
you've met one person on the autism

405
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:04,180
spectrum

406
00:23:04,180 --> 00:23:07,230
you've met one person on the autism
spectrum

407
00:23:07,230 --> 00:23:11,020
everybody manifests differently

408
00:23:11,020 --> 00:23:16,060
that is true and autism is not something
you have it something you are

409
00:23:16,060 --> 00:23:20,210
it's an adjective to describe the type
of person is not saying you get from

410
00:23:20,210 --> 00:23:20,750
eating

411
00:23:20,750 --> 00:23:25,220
eating a at McDonalds or something for
Casio camera shot

412
00:23:25,220 --> 00:23:30,090
am as much as some people would like to
thank you but

413
00:23:30,090 --> 00:23:33,209
the idea for this talk came from arm
that

414
00:23:33,210 --> 00:23:37,350
early came here a couple years ago and
just occurred to me that

415
00:23:37,350 --> 00:23:40,780
actual science fiction mentions UN
General looks like there's a specific

416
00:23:40,780 --> 00:23:43,940
kinda persons in the dimensions Asher

417
00:23:43,940 --> 00:23:48,900
because like it's kinda hard to describe
but there's a specific kind offers an

418
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:50,360
example of this was when

419
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:53,780
ever showed up last night here and
kitman guy's name but

420
00:23:53,780 --> 00:23:57,730
has gone what happened we're talking and
he was talking about the horrible noises

421
00:23:57,730 --> 00:23:58,500
on the subway

422
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:03,060
and the lighting on the subway and I'm
don't think that he knew

423
00:24:03,060 --> 00:24:06,110
what he was describing inadvertently but

424
00:24:06,110 --> 00:24:10,220
I thought it was like great you know
that like how it go inside the stock

425
00:24:10,220 --> 00:24:13,570
one other ways of thinking at this is

426
00:24:13,570 --> 00:24:16,840
okay so I'm an academic and I go to

427
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:22,220
you know academic conferences all the
time the difference between

428
00:24:22,220 --> 00:24:25,840
say someone who goes to the English
language

429
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:31,379
association meetings those people are
very very different

430
00:24:31,380 --> 00:24:34,960
from people who say go to science
fiction conventions

431
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:38,600
although many people with science
fiction conventions are in fact

432
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:42,460
interested in literature and would fit
in well and

433
00:24:42,460 --> 00:24:46,720
at the associate Association for
American languages meetings for example

434
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:50,330
however there's a bunch of people at
science fiction conventions

435
00:24:50,330 --> 00:24:56,530
who would fit in better here the
difference between them an ass

436
00:24:56,530 --> 00:25:00,120
is that the people who got a science
fiction conventions like to read

437
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:04,660
about making stuff the people who come
here like to make stuff

438
00:25:04,660 --> 00:25:07,790
metal I see the differences

439
00:25:07,790 --> 00:25:11,320
cell questions

440
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:15,300
so yeah here is a microphone up here in
the center

441
00:25:15,300 --> 00:25:20,060
on if you'd like to ask questions you
know where we're now here on the firing

442
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:21,340
line for you know probably

443
00:25:21,340 --> 00:25:25,010
will probably keep thinking about things
to say yet to have any cash daily

444
00:25:25,010 --> 00:25:28,550
gonna my ass then answer it in like as
in

445
00:25:28,550 --> 00:25:31,550
as if you had acid there's a possibility

446
00:25:31,550 --> 00:25:35,149
that exists well

447
00:25:35,150 --> 00:25:39,240
um the reason I'm here is a I help my
brother get diagnosed with Aspergers

448
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:44,370
couple years ago arm I have la to kill
actually with actors atrium like crap

449
00:25:44,370 --> 00:25:47,910
as I just I was lazy is a life arm but

450
00:25:47,910 --> 00:25:51,390
after I read up on and I discovered more
about it

451
00:25:51,390 --> 00:25:55,140
cycle at is my brother um one other
things that

452
00:25:55,140 --> 00:25:59,230
I have trouble relating with my brother
and so the reason I'm here's to learn

453
00:25:59,230 --> 00:26:01,180
more about it but also to understand

454
00:26:01,180 --> 00:26:04,360
from your perspective I

455
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:08,280
a try to help them inspired him but not
exactly sure how much is being

456
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:11,490
you're an asshole versus how much is
really hoping on

457
00:26:11,490 --> 00:26:15,780
so I was wondering people who try to
help you were norrell

458
00:26:15,780 --> 00:26:18,870
nerd near a typical ce um

459
00:26:18,870 --> 00:26:22,770
well like from your experience is what
would help us now that first I want to

460
00:26:22,770 --> 00:26:26,050
say that nerd typical as the technical
scientific term for people not on the

461
00:26:26,050 --> 00:26:26,930
autism spectrum

462
00:26:26,930 --> 00:26:29,820
but I hate the term because it implies
that if you're not on the autism

463
00:26:29,820 --> 00:26:31,500
spectrum you're like normal

464
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:34,920
and I think that everybody hope doesn't
have autism but the people who don't

465
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:36,610
have autism partner a typical

466
00:26:36,610 --> 00:26:39,330
what does that even mean who's your
typical I've never met an artifical

467
00:26:39,330 --> 00:26:40,260
person in my life

468
00:26:40,260 --> 00:26:47,260
anywhere nah met I couldn't hear the
American languages Association that %ah

469
00:26:47,530 --> 00:26:50,879
but I have to say that I had an ex
boyfriend who was probably

470
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:54,010
the only nerd typical person I can think
of meeting that he is the epitome of

471
00:26:54,010 --> 00:26:54,920
here to the colony

472
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:58,170
and this is before I was diagnosed
neither of us really knew about autism

473
00:26:58,170 --> 00:26:59,650
we didn't know I had autism earn

474
00:26:59,650 --> 00:27:03,550
dye was autistic whatever terminology
one use and he just knew that there were

475
00:27:03,550 --> 00:27:06,909
some things that I didn't do for
whatever reason and I did wrong I did

476
00:27:06,910 --> 00:27:09,330
weirdly and so we set out to try to fix
me

477
00:27:09,330 --> 00:27:13,470
and that worked out badly and the I
think the biggest difference between

478
00:27:13,470 --> 00:27:16,840
being an asshole and being helpful as
you don't wanna try to fix somebody

479
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:17,390
you're not a

480
00:27:17,390 --> 00:27:21,120
fixed and that's just how they are but
you can teach somebody sell for example

481
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:24,580
I learned a lot from him I learned to
say good how are you and said good

482
00:27:24,580 --> 00:27:28,379
and that sort of thing I learned how to
I like to listen to my place when I talk

483
00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:31,350
so I can vary within two nations that
are just talking like this all the time

484
00:27:31,350 --> 00:27:32,390
our talk to people talk

485
00:27:32,390 --> 00:27:35,770
way to fasten American how insane that
sort of thing that I i learned

486
00:27:35,770 --> 00:27:38,210
self-awareness and pay attention to
myself

487
00:27:38,210 --> 00:27:43,870
but trying to guilt someone into forcing
something they can't do that like

488
00:27:43,870 --> 00:27:47,290
we would he try to have the emotional
relationship conversations in our that

489
00:27:47,290 --> 00:27:48,399
here's how I feel

490
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:52,140
here's why I feel that way your turn and
I tried to say that there was nothing in

491
00:27:52,140 --> 00:27:52,410
there

492
00:27:52,410 --> 00:27:55,310
I don't know I don't know what I feel I
don't know how I feel it it's like a

493
00:27:55,310 --> 00:27:56,429
blue screen of death

494
00:27:56,430 --> 00:27:59,480
and she thought I was overthinking it he
said just open your mouth

495
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:04,200
and talk whatever comes out and I said
that's not how it works yeah I like

496
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:08,100
I don't think in words I think in
pictures and so i cant do that I can't

497
00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:10,050
explain my emotions without

498
00:28:10,050 --> 00:28:13,060
hours and hours of deliberation trying
to sort through them

499
00:28:13,060 --> 00:28:16,110
though through this I learned how to
kinda figure out my emotions

500
00:28:16,110 --> 00:28:20,490
but the if if someone you know is on the
autism spectrum you trying to help them

501
00:28:20,490 --> 00:28:24,230
if there's something that they tell you
they can't do don't force it

502
00:28:24,230 --> 00:28:27,500
maybe try to give them advice to how to
work around whatever is giving them

503
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:31,370
problems but if they can't do something
the public a a and you're just gonna

504
00:28:31,370 --> 00:28:34,530
make them feel worse about themselves by
telling them that oh yes you can do it

505
00:28:34,530 --> 00:28:36,129
you're just not trying hard enough

506
00:28:36,130 --> 00:28:40,190
some sometimes sometimes though it is
there is a certain level up well I'm not

507
00:28:40,190 --> 00:28:42,100
comfortable at this and I'm not gonna
try

508
00:28:42,100 --> 00:28:46,490
and and if you do and if you do come off
maybe a little there's an asshole

509
00:28:46,490 --> 00:28:49,640
on I've had people come off that way but
now

510
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:52,280
later on looking back it's legal
actually how to learn something from

511
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:54,920
that situation so its own away

512
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:58,320
I would say that you definitely do you
wanna help

513
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:01,300
because you want to get you wanna but
you have to help in the right way you

514
00:29:01,300 --> 00:29:02,120
have to

515
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:05,140
be very logical about it be very

516
00:29:05,140 --> 00:29:08,170
direct you can sail will you know I
don't just

517
00:29:08,170 --> 00:29:12,560
happen well you know you'll you'll just
learn SEO just pick it up

518
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:15,639
that I get people get that kinda base
all the time cuz that's how I have it

519
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:16,490
for them

520
00:29:16,490 --> 00:29:19,620
there's a there's often an elemental
what's

521
00:29:19,620 --> 00:29:23,140
in it for him to learn to do something

522
00:29:23,140 --> 00:29:26,570
and if you can explain why it's
important

523
00:29:26,570 --> 00:29:30,730
to act normal

524
00:29:30,730 --> 00:29:35,160
that often helps that that they eat arm
there has to be some self

525
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:39,180
interest for the person on the spectrum
to change

526
00:29:39,180 --> 00:29:43,360
what is normal for them like I've seen
his kids kids I'll be like why don't

527
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:46,050
need to take a shower while a 10-year
take a shower and I don't care I don't

528
00:29:46,050 --> 00:29:47,379
care that I smell bad

529
00:29:47,380 --> 00:29:50,410
and then but then also ask asking why
they don't have a girlfriend

530
00:29:50,410 --> 00:29:54,250
but if I'm able to like connect those
two together a lotta times

531
00:29:54,250 --> 00:29:57,950
that then it does still get the picture
yet surprisingly

532
00:29:57,950 --> 00:30:02,670
sometimes still now now I can use that
example I did not shower regularly until

533
00:30:02,670 --> 00:30:03,580
this

534
00:30:03,580 --> 00:30:07,449
your typical axe told me you know people
can tell that you don't shower

535
00:30:07,450 --> 00:30:11,180
and I really I thought people couldn't
tell and he said you know people not

536
00:30:11,180 --> 00:30:13,340
only can tell you say all I don't care
what people think

537
00:30:13,340 --> 00:30:16,390
well what people think the fact your
day-to-day life things will be easier

538
00:30:16,390 --> 00:30:18,240
for you with people like you

539
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:21,630
and social have learning social skills
people like you with you learn social

540
00:30:21,630 --> 00:30:22,640
skills

541
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:26,410
just saying his all that was thinking
that just saying like you know

542
00:30:26,410 --> 00:30:29,860
because it's rude because it's wrong but
like not a good reason by

543
00:30:29,860 --> 00:30:33,460
he say like because you're more likely
to get a job that you want

544
00:30:33,460 --> 00:30:37,890
you know Mike its it has yet they have
to have the value to them

545
00:30:37,890 --> 00:30:44,260
and if you can make that clear the mail
want to do it actively

546
00:30:44,260 --> 00:30:49,170
as a psychological test for Aspergers
comprise about 50 questions and curious

547
00:30:49,170 --> 00:30:52,480
if any of you have taken that test and
yeah if you were drawn

548
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:56,600
it actually made me that I it's I'm not
sure who put it out there that are dumb

549
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:59,840
question as an invite all over the
internet if you do the self-test incurs

550
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:00,700
also

551
00:31:00,700 --> 00:31:04,010
you think it's accurate to 35 comment a
fifty

552
00:31:04,010 --> 00:31:07,690
yeah I've taken like all these tests and
so far I found that the longer ones tend

553
00:31:07,690 --> 00:31:10,070
to be better I think I know you're
talking about the city crash when I

554
00:31:10,070 --> 00:31:12,070
think that must be the HQ

555
00:31:12,070 --> 00:31:16,210
and that one's pretty good its too short
to really be comprehensive really

556
00:31:16,210 --> 00:31:19,560
I recommend it hasn't silly name that
the ASCII quiz

557
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:22,820
he will be asking ways it has several
hundred questions

558
00:31:22,820 --> 00:31:26,070
and it's constantly updating based on
the people can fill in whether they have

559
00:31:26,070 --> 00:31:29,139
a diagnosis or not they compare the
answers from people who are on the

560
00:31:29,140 --> 00:31:29,880
spectrum

561
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:32,970
and some other questions have nothing to
do with autism service controls

562
00:31:32,970 --> 00:31:37,200
and it gives you a spider diagram is not
just a yes or no it gives you which

563
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:40,800
areas you're stronger week in a row
where how you present

564
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:44,600
that sort of thing and so is the much
better to wall and so you can tell

565
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:47,870
whether your artistic or maybe just a
little spectrum even whenever

566
00:31:47,870 --> 00:31:51,030
and I like that and sometimes when you
take these tests

567
00:31:51,030 --> 00:31:54,490
on you'll get all I'm not on the
spectrum but then if someone else to the

568
00:31:54,490 --> 00:31:57,260
test and pretended that they were you an
answer as if the lady

569
00:31:57,260 --> 00:32:01,460
from their perception a view menu it
passed with flying colors Indiana

570
00:32:01,460 --> 00:32:05,580
yes like sometimes we don't have we all
of course I'm but its social skills yeah

571
00:32:05,580 --> 00:32:10,120
Shanghai parties all the time can you
answer the question is what you hear

572
00:32:10,120 --> 00:32:14,640
a depending on the day yes so you know
your numbers can

573
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:18,510
can vary depending on how you're feeling
but

574
00:32:18,510 --> 00:32:22,370
I took a couple of them when I was still
in denial and they if they all made me

575
00:32:22,370 --> 00:32:26,210
cry

576
00:32:26,210 --> 00:32:29,910
hi my name's Tatiana and I think it's
very interesting that the subjective

577
00:32:29,910 --> 00:32:33,470
job-seeking keeps coming up so I'm
actually a Technical Recruiter

578
00:32:33,470 --> 00:32:37,710
and I a week ago a week ago I was
training a junior recruiter on had a new

579
00:32:37,710 --> 00:32:38,790
phone screens

580
00:32:38,790 --> 00:32:43,190
and we talked to this one guy who seem
to be very technically proficient and we

581
00:32:43,190 --> 00:32:46,080
got off the phone she was like wow was
that just like the most

582
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:50,110
awful interview ever and I said you know
I actually think he's probably on the

583
00:32:50,110 --> 00:32:51,230
autism spectrum

584
00:32:51,230 --> 00:32:54,530
because he was speaking in monotone and
it was kinda difficult to pull

585
00:32:54,530 --> 00:32:56,470
additional information to him as I said

586
00:32:56,470 --> 00:32:59,870
you know I think we need to be sensitive
about that we need to pass these notes

587
00:32:59,870 --> 00:33:02,800
on the hiring manager because he seems
really technically good

588
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:06,410
but I wasn't really able to elaborate
past that so I would really love

589
00:33:06,410 --> 00:33:10,100
your guy's advice on how we can be more
sensitive to that

590
00:33:10,100 --> 00:33:13,520
ask them to show you what they've done
Miami

591
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:17,240
like a lot and they will have some sort
of projects they will die in themselves

592
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:18,950
yeah I didn't work only of sorts

593
00:33:18,950 --> 00:33:22,780
and that's a really good way on but
that's like

594
00:33:22,780 --> 00:33:26,100
a big a big new thing in in recruiting
is

595
00:33:26,100 --> 00:33:29,410
you know tapping the untapped talent

596
00:33:29,410 --> 00:33:33,640
in you know all these like people who
spend all day programming

597
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:37,020
yes a few if you're looking for a
holiday like that I mean

598
00:33:37,020 --> 00:33:40,990
its it's like feeding rabbits you just
need to occasionally possible

599
00:33:40,990 --> 00:33:44,590
you know more more club Monte and and

600
00:33:44,590 --> 00:33:49,430
in chocolate and and they'll just sit
there a program and 20 hours a day haha

601
00:33:49,430 --> 00:33:53,690
does University that I go to has their
business program starting to adopt what

602
00:33:53,690 --> 00:33:56,480
you're talking about that one might wear
my friends just graduated she had a

603
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:59,040
class where they didn't exercise like
this chin

604
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:02,340
for Autism Awareness that they gave all
the students %ah

605
00:34:02,340 --> 00:34:06,270
questions basically you have this
hypothetical guy outperforms everyone in

606
00:34:06,270 --> 00:34:10,320
your company out produces everyone in
your company is your best worker by far

607
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:14,669
of but I hee hee there have been
complaints from other workers that they

608
00:34:14,668 --> 00:34:16,929
make that he makes them feel
uncomfortable

609
00:34:16,929 --> 00:34:20,569
he doesn't talk appropriately he's very
monotone he's socially awkward

610
00:34:20,570 --> 00:34:24,150
he he doesn't machines behaved
inappropriately but he

611
00:34:24,150 --> 00:34:27,418
are that like no harassment thing like
that is just weird

612
00:34:27,418 --> 00:34:30,879
and but he's the best person the company
would you promote him

613
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:34,040
and everybody's that no this guy's all I
want to fire him

614
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:37,239
and so the professor turned around and
read them what they said said you

615
00:34:37,240 --> 00:34:40,210
do you realize what you're saying you
want to fire your best employees because

616
00:34:40,210 --> 00:34:42,770
he doesn't know how to make small talk
at the coffee machine

617
00:34:42,770 --> 00:34:45,989
had pet and so they they were doing
Autism Awareness a

618
00:34:45,990 --> 00:34:49,780
kinda as you're saying the higher ups
especially getting programs to

619
00:34:49,780 --> 00:34:53,200
bird I explaining what autism is that it
is not

620
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:56,480
like the weird guy in the office who
you're worrying about whether he's gonna

621
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:58,460
go postal Sunday that it's just for

622
00:34:58,460 --> 00:35:02,630
to offer a guy who's really good at his
job in that being able to look past the

623
00:35:02,630 --> 00:35:04,740
interview indicate whether they can
shake hands and

624
00:35:04,740 --> 00:35:08,250
that sorta stuff and looking at the
resume at what they can do

625
00:35:08,250 --> 00:35:11,410
and so that's really educate the
recruiters educating the boss is the

626
00:35:11,410 --> 00:35:13,080
people in the office that sorta thing

627
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:17,100
and so it's really a systemic issue it's
hard to address in just one

628
00:35:17,100 --> 00:35:21,339
way but on the bright side it seems that
more companies are

629
00:35:21,340 --> 00:35:25,080
becoming aware they're they're like
entire companies that are devoted to

630
00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:29,200
staffing people with autism yeah
different Google's go into this now too

631
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:32,640
yet all even as an option yeah are we

632
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:36,299
leave talk to them about that they have
an entire like autism special project

633
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:36,840
that their

634
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:40,280
that there were trying to recruit people
without degrees without experience but

635
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:44,670
do good work and like because a lot of
times people on the spectrum you know I

636
00:35:44,670 --> 00:35:48,890
for instance I I was in school and
college I would work to Tom I

637
00:35:48,890 --> 00:35:50,020
special-interest

638
00:35:50,020 --> 00:35:53,680
sometimes I was able to lick mill then
somehow make it into something they gave

639
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:56,520
me a great deal and that didn't happen I
would just work on my special interests

640
00:35:56,520 --> 00:35:59,830
and I feel other work that I was a bust
themselves Jack bailed out of high

641
00:35:59,830 --> 00:36:00,960
school but has

642
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:05,140
the are all FBI crime lab directors
sworn testimony that he has a doctorate

643
00:36:05,140 --> 00:36:07,170
degree knowledge explosive chemistry

644
00:36:07,170 --> 00:36:14,170
this way

645
00:36:15,420 --> 00:36:19,080
re: this gonna be fine I'm one of those
people

646
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:23,350
back and chill like very recently maybe
like

647
00:36:23,350 --> 00:36:28,160
she state months ago pretty much was

648
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:31,980
kinda Lake in denial didn't want to be
been there didn't wanna

649
00:36:31,980 --> 00:36:35,380
different like I wanted to be normal

650
00:36:35,380 --> 00:36:39,700
yes not but i wasnt and it was not going
to work people the RTS

651
00:36:39,700 --> 00:36:43,790
poor social skills arm

652
00:36:43,790 --> 00:36:50,220
Ste lack attacked and recently actually
got myself in trouble because the back

653
00:36:50,220 --> 00:36:56,280
I have been tired the people that did
not like me and i got up went from like

654
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:59,700
calm I actually don't have Aspergers

655
00:36:59,700 --> 00:37:03,440
I have the one catch-all IAEA no's'

656
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:06,850
yes that's exactly what I have

657
00:37:06,850 --> 00:37:11,380
so I don't have like the sensory things
I don't have all that

658
00:37:11,380 --> 00:37:15,110
I can't make eye contact for shared my
social skills

659
00:37:15,110 --> 00:37:18,440
are RA arm

660
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:22,760
I don't think you really have excessive
interests by

661
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:27,000
he probably did 30 years site

662
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:32,700
okay yeah I think obsessive makes it
sound as if it because hope is also

663
00:37:32,700 --> 00:37:36,030
yeah okay his calm

664
00:37:36,030 --> 00:37:39,370
by yeah I was just kind of like

665
00:37:39,370 --> 00:37:42,480
do any other people really here late

666
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:46,840
how many people here have PDT not
otherwise specified

667
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:50,180
what is pervasive developmental disorder
its

668
00:37:50,180 --> 00:37:54,129
not others tonight can I say something
on that in fact that is a term that

669
00:37:54,130 --> 00:37:57,940
that really does not def differentiate
much from wanna

670
00:37:57,940 --> 00:38:01,310
Aspergers autism is in fact there and
believe it's it's no longer are you

671
00:38:01,310 --> 00:38:02,000
going to be

672
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:05,950
it's not in there manual because it its
it's not a choice

673
00:38:05,950 --> 00:38:09,100
it's mainly used when they wanna tell
parents that someone has autism they

674
00:38:09,100 --> 00:38:10,210
don't them the pass again

675
00:38:10,210 --> 00:38:13,880
feel you get off rate and stuff so they
just make up some name that sounds last

676
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:14,320
Sat

677
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:18,090
that's not entirely true it's that you
don't sound if you don't me to not have

678
00:38:18,090 --> 00:38:19,390
the criteria Ted

679
00:38:19,390 --> 00:38:23,129
get the like points you know to be
officially diagnosed with the diagnosis

680
00:38:23,130 --> 00:38:27,220
requirements are one aimed at children
to not very apprehensive now for good

681
00:38:27,220 --> 00:38:27,850
anyway

682
00:38:27,850 --> 00:38:31,839
LCD and West basically means your
artistic but you don't really meet

683
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:33,410
autism criteria

684
00:38:33,410 --> 00:38:36,940
but we don't really know what to do
legally Aspergers yeah exactly that for

685
00:38:36,940 --> 00:38:37,220
you

686
00:38:37,220 --> 00:38:41,620
but you do that i mean the people I CDs
people they say oh i piedi no's' unlike

687
00:38:41,620 --> 00:38:45,270
the IU yeah you have autism okay yes
clear

688
00:38:45,270 --> 00:38:49,410
I don't see how how assets glee is on
tonight

689
00:38:49,410 --> 00:38:54,690
autism I think classical autism yeah
here you gotta get past that

690
00:38:54,690 --> 00:38:59,860
I'm actually having an easier time arm
on her ring to it as a st. autism

691
00:38:59,860 --> 00:39:01,040
spectrum disorder

692
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:05,950
an Aspergers I'm really didn't like
anglers the house parkinson's great

693
00:39:05,950 --> 00:39:10,150
like okay I'm on the spectrum I can
probably learn a lot from that

694
00:39:10,150 --> 00:39:14,220
yup and also probably meet more awkward
people

695
00:39:14,220 --> 00:39:17,430
yeah a good way to make friends

696
00:39:17,430 --> 00:39:21,020
so I ever someone tells you that your
artistic can you say I am

697
00:39:21,020 --> 00:39:25,460
5 figurative and I mean and it it also
helps to you

698
00:39:25,460 --> 00:39:28,810
explain lay what like

699
00:39:28,810 --> 00:39:31,990
not just the five but it's plainly but

700
00:39:31,990 --> 00:39:35,910
people but like of talk to people all
say things like

701
00:39:35,910 --> 00:39:39,500
trying to clean up a mass like at
practice someone of

702
00:39:39,500 --> 00:39:44,640
and a train to do that I will see that
I'm scene of fire there yeah I killed it

703
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:45,259
be just the

704
00:39:45,260 --> 00:39:48,530
Whaley boys where the social cues are so

705
00:39:48,530 --> 00:39:51,800
glaringly obvious

706
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:56,060
yeah this song but there's someone the
9s

707
00:39:56,060 --> 00:39:59,710
yeah I I feel yah I

708
00:39:59,710 --> 00:40:03,170
yeah absolutely pisses me off makes you
feel like shit

709
00:40:03,170 --> 00:40:07,270
when it happened this is the thing is
that Lake once you realize that

710
00:40:07,270 --> 00:40:10,440
that it's not your fault that when
you're you you're doing these things

711
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:12,300
because you're you're trying to do it

712
00:40:12,300 --> 00:40:15,690
in the right lane if you can explain it
to them and they can understand and most

713
00:40:15,690 --> 00:40:17,360
people have you explain the right way

714
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:20,150
you if you can't figure out a way that
you can get through to them to make them

715
00:40:20,150 --> 00:40:21,800
understand why you're doing these things
they'll

716
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:25,320
understand giving more more patients
apparently

717
00:40:25,320 --> 00:40:29,780
yeah but to help you specifically it
sounds like you need to read the book

718
00:40:29,780 --> 00:40:33,530
the cursed in print oh you mean it was
not about Google body language

719
00:40:33,530 --> 00:40:34,270
dictionary

720
00:40:34,270 --> 00:40:38,220
yeah I think wanna so many other
appetite arm

721
00:40:38,220 --> 00:40:41,450
like I'm actually around it people right
now

722
00:40:41,450 --> 00:40:47,620
that if I'm not 100 percent politically
correct

723
00:40:47,620 --> 00:40:52,040
don't jump on me I would hang out with
me so let me ask my

724
00:40:52,040 --> 00:40:56,759
kak that's politically incur make being
politically correct

725
00:40:56,760 --> 00:41:00,380
nearly impossible on the side
politically correct this facilitates

726
00:41:00,380 --> 00:41:01,520
awesome jokes

727
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:05,290
shuttling thank you that is true

728
00:41:05,290 --> 00:41:09,100
kinda Hannah over can offer this um
there's more than a maybe minor

729
00:41:09,100 --> 00:41:13,110
demeanor non-typical cuz you you just
hear about artist question disorder

730
00:41:13,110 --> 00:41:16,470
yeah I have attention deficit
hyperactivity disorder and

731
00:41:16,470 --> 00:41:20,380
about half my stuff it's with autism
spectrum disorder but the other half

732
00:41:20,380 --> 00:41:21,680
just completely doesn't

733
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:24,870
and I have a really good therapist right
now the more I learn the more

734
00:41:24,870 --> 00:41:28,359
because I was like this in second grade
which is like ladies early nineties no

735
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:29,400
more I learn the more

736
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:33,330
because a in a new research that more
than the stuff that I michael maybe have

737
00:41:33,330 --> 00:41:36,860
some Aspergers I actually talked to make
their first mother's he's like no active

738
00:41:36,860 --> 00:41:41,940
we now know that people with ADD also do
this so like the poor social skills

739
00:41:41,940 --> 00:41:45,730
the the knot theory faces I went from
not being able to read faces to being

740
00:41:45,730 --> 00:41:47,530
way too hyper sensitive in like

741
00:41:47,530 --> 00:41:51,150
my retired as angry always

742
00:41:51,150 --> 00:41:55,410
I retired I think this might have to go
are you having great healer just hired

743
00:41:55,410 --> 00:41:56,180
so

744
00:41:56,180 --> 00:41:59,620
if you feel like you don't this is kinda
feeling that it's not really didn't meet

745
00:41:59,620 --> 00:42:00,540
you have wanted the

746
00:42:00,540 --> 00:42:04,009
other way to being your own on typical
look into that yeah

747
00:42:04,010 --> 00:42:07,350
helping the lender divers the movement
there's more than just autism

748
00:42:07,350 --> 00:42:11,089
energy began their then diagrams we all
overlap we're all different

749
00:42:11,090 --> 00:42:14,930
and the whole year if a disability years
it has been different I think media can

750
00:42:14,930 --> 00:42:17,589
be one for one person and one for
another and I think it's more a

751
00:42:17,590 --> 00:42:20,960
do you feel this is holding you back in
your life does it help

752
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:24,320
you at this point to light to done by
this has a disability

753
00:42:24,320 --> 00:42:28,530
and if it does then go ahead and do that
you know cuz I mean identifying

754
00:42:28,530 --> 00:42:31,840
both is just being different and is a
disability because sometimes it really

755
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:33,120
does go with my life so

756
00:42:33,120 --> 00:42:36,960
yep use what works for you

757
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:40,690
playing could you talk a little bit
about the process every patterning your

758
00:42:40,690 --> 00:42:41,630
vocal style

759
00:42:41,630 --> 00:42:45,140
well what type of exercises you to do
with your turn useful

760
00:42:45,140 --> 00:42:48,730
recording yourself is helpful like the
good camera for something

761
00:42:48,730 --> 00:42:52,280
not not just cuz I mean it takes at the
base it makes you sound weird but

762
00:42:52,280 --> 00:42:57,380
if I your monotone it and if you're
talking too fast I top 20 fasteners for

763
00:42:57,380 --> 00:42:57,890
me

764
00:42:57,890 --> 00:43:03,200
that listening to yourself and then from
Bath trying to listen to your voice wall

765
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:04,130
you're talking

766
00:43:04,130 --> 00:43:07,690
and being able to learn to kinda
autocorrect while you're talking

767
00:43:07,690 --> 00:43:11,190
in so long time to relax back and the
two pass monotone convoys like this

768
00:43:11,190 --> 00:43:14,820
but I can slow down and notice I'm doing
it and revert back to

769
00:43:14,820 --> 00:43:18,720
going up and down in the appropriate
places going up for questions and things

770
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:19,490
like that

771
00:43:19,490 --> 00:43:22,580
and should and that I know it takes a
lot of practice and it takes a lot of

772
00:43:22,580 --> 00:43:23,710
self-awareness that

773
00:43:23,710 --> 00:43:27,030
if you forget if you're tired or if
you're strasser does not pay attention

774
00:43:27,030 --> 00:43:28,609
you can relapse

775
00:43:28,609 --> 00:43:32,160
whenever relapse is not the right term
but %ah that

776
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:36,470
it takes a lot of focus because I think
while to see people tire out in social

777
00:43:36,470 --> 00:43:38,090
situations as we have to focus

778
00:43:38,090 --> 00:43:41,480
ten times more than anyone else but if
you do it for a long enough period of

779
00:43:41,480 --> 00:43:42,370
time in your cock

780
00:43:42,370 --> 00:43:45,950
you'll be thinking about this for way
too long you'll be in a social situation

781
00:43:45,950 --> 00:43:47,570
on will drain you

782
00:43:47,570 --> 00:43:50,980
eventually or you'll pick up some %uh
that it'll become natural your

783
00:43:50,980 --> 00:43:55,370
adding a very slow rate not to have her
the 10,000 hour rule at

784
00:43:55,370 --> 00:43:58,710
the best thing is slow down and

785
00:43:58,710 --> 00:44:02,900
putting up YouTube videos people who you
admire their voices are vocal pattern

786
00:44:02,900 --> 00:44:06,190
and trying to copy them I got my voice
II gotta

787
00:44:06,190 --> 00:44:10,290
I cut my I got advice from of
transgender woman who said that has she

788
00:44:10,290 --> 00:44:12,920
learned how to talk to a girl that she
copied I hear her name

789
00:44:12,920 --> 00:44:16,090
a woman from the office was a really
girly voice so I looked her up to and

790
00:44:16,090 --> 00:44:16,880
copy her voice

791
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:20,010
my lady think like Brad Pitt naturally
salad sexy

792
00:44:20,010 --> 00:44:23,600
yeah I'd like to learn how to talk like
that it's not it's not like

793
00:44:23,600 --> 00:44:27,109
it's natural for everyone Andy any any
pairs as

794
00:44:27,109 --> 00:44:30,799
you that and I and he called us closer
analysis

795
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:34,910
but have a question for you which is arm
because is a spectrum

796
00:44:34,910 --> 00:44:39,089
as you mention and there are you know
you can be artistic and lonely

797
00:44:39,090 --> 00:44:43,670
and maybe not another and there's um we
also as adults he said fine was a

798
00:44:43,670 --> 00:44:48,040
compensating and since all the
diagnostic materials geared for children

799
00:44:48,040 --> 00:44:52,040
what can you talk about how it's
benefited you especially you marry as an

800
00:44:52,040 --> 00:44:53,009
adult

801
00:44:53,010 --> 00:44:58,130
to come to terms with it um and and use
the the label as you have

802
00:44:58,130 --> 00:45:02,450
today and what why we don't just throw
up our hands go well I pumped enough in

803
00:45:02,450 --> 00:45:07,140
I it doesn't really matter you know what
why does it why does it matter to us to

804
00:45:07,140 --> 00:45:13,240
to identify one one of I find that I
don't piss people off quite so much

805
00:45:13,240 --> 00:45:17,930
when I tell them up front that I don't
recognize people's

806
00:45:17,930 --> 00:45:23,279
because you know I can't tell you big
because I literally can't tell you

807
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:27,400
how many times I've walked past people
on the street that I know

808
00:45:27,400 --> 00:45:32,950
but I don't recognize some I now have as
my default expression this kind of

809
00:45:32,950 --> 00:45:36,140
you know half smile in if someone looks

810
00:45:36,140 --> 00:45:39,839
vaguely like they're looking at me I
smile lecture

811
00:45:39,840 --> 00:45:44,950
do I have no freakin clue who they are

812
00:45:44,950 --> 00:45:49,760
so you know I I think I've it is I'm I'm
kinda mindlessly

813
00:45:49,760 --> 00:45:52,870
um amiable all the time

814
00:45:52,870 --> 00:45:56,020
on the street and and that's my default

815
00:45:56,020 --> 00:45:59,609
as a teenager might default wasn't
absolutely

816
00:45:59,609 --> 00:46:03,240
expressionless face that people assumed
meant

817
00:46:03,240 --> 00:46:07,470
I hated bomb and what to remove their
livers

818
00:46:07,470 --> 00:46:11,410
should the ice police to hate me

819
00:46:11,410 --> 00:46:15,660
lake in class and then like my one my
friends his band few classes

820
00:46:15,660 --> 00:46:19,160
at my mom house in college he would say
that any time

821
00:46:19,160 --> 00:46:21,910
I would not sometimes i would tell
people that I was on a spectrum into

822
00:46:21,910 --> 00:46:22,210
like

823
00:46:22,210 --> 00:46:25,170
halfway through the class and they would
hate me and treat me like really like

824
00:46:25,170 --> 00:46:26,690
shitty they would just

825
00:46:26,690 --> 00:46:31,000
be mean to me minute like I said that I
was on the ice inspecting explain what

826
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:31,680
that was

827
00:46:31,680 --> 00:46:34,490
they would you complete everyone in the
entire class would completely change the

828
00:46:34,490 --> 00:46:36,130
Chilean like be really family in

829
00:46:36,130 --> 00:46:39,980
be nice to me not because they felt bad
but in part because at that but also

830
00:46:39,980 --> 00:46:41,560
because they realize that they were
being like

831
00:46:41,560 --> 00:46:45,790
a jerk because I wasn't trying to do
that I know is also oMG

832
00:46:45,790 --> 00:46:49,840
I interview de gas I want is a woman
does ask maxene she has autism

833
00:46:49,840 --> 00:46:53,109
that she said as an adult her biggest
thing is full disclosure

834
00:46:53,109 --> 00:46:56,250
and you don't necessarily have to use
the word autism because that draws to

835
00:46:56,250 --> 00:46:59,080
mind a totally disabled young child for
most people

836
00:46:59,080 --> 00:47:02,590
and so I have a friend who has autism is
how late and I'll

837
00:47:02,590 --> 00:47:05,970
but what she refers to her biggest
disability is that I and I share this

838
00:47:05,970 --> 00:47:07,850
she has audio processing disorder

839
00:47:07,850 --> 00:47:10,900
that if there's a whole lotta background
noise it's hard to separate

840
00:47:10,900 --> 00:47:14,370
only noise is and so if for example in a
conference I can't tell if someone

841
00:47:14,370 --> 00:47:16,859
saying to me unless they're facing me
with their mouth

842
00:47:16,859 --> 00:47:20,910
and very close to my hand wash their
lips moved and so she instead of saying

843
00:47:20,910 --> 00:47:23,460
she has autism machine she even say that
English is now

844
00:47:23,460 --> 00:47:26,820
but for me instead of saying I have
autism I'll tell somebody ok could you

845
00:47:26,820 --> 00:47:27,550
repeat that

846
00:47:27,550 --> 00:47:31,810
and they say what why LP it Mike twice
then think I'm joking and stop

847
00:47:31,810 --> 00:47:34,759
and I have to say no I have audio
processing disorder and that doesn't

848
00:47:34,760 --> 00:47:37,260
carry the social connotations

849
00:47:37,260 --> 00:47:40,670
and so if you can find terms for if you
have a particular

850
00:47:40,670 --> 00:47:44,900
area where you are slightly disabled or
really disabled when ever find a term

851
00:47:44,900 --> 00:47:47,120
for that separate from autism that
people can

852
00:47:47,120 --> 00:47:50,460
understand without having like the
lecture just I'll I've audio processing

853
00:47:50,460 --> 00:47:51,590
problems

854
00:47:51,590 --> 00:47:55,170
or I am bad at directions are on bad
whenever you're bad it just explain what

855
00:47:55,170 --> 00:47:56,920
it is and people they are okay

856
00:47:56,920 --> 00:48:02,000
understand because not everyone no one's
perfect some people are

857
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:05,690
I am the up so this is a

858
00:48:05,690 --> 00:48:10,100
a scientific question I'm unfortunately
it seems like the field of psychiatry

859
00:48:10,100 --> 00:48:11,240
and mental health

860
00:48:11,240 --> 00:48:14,740
is very imprecise on

861
00:48:14,740 --> 00:48:18,730
in such a way that you know you can
imagine having diseases that are either

862
00:48:18,730 --> 00:48:20,370
on or off

863
00:48:20,370 --> 00:48:23,779
I'm and this is a cluster analysis might
be able to show that

864
00:48:23,780 --> 00:48:27,000
right to it see the normal people would
close from one end of the

865
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:30,370
have spectrum but the other people
together and but there's also more

866
00:48:30,370 --> 00:48:31,400
continuous

867
00:48:31,400 --> 00:48:35,570
disorders which autism spectrum disorder
seems to be

868
00:48:35,570 --> 00:48:39,130
um but I'm wondering um if there has
been

869
00:48:39,130 --> 00:48:42,290
on efforts to a

870
00:48:42,290 --> 00:48:47,170
collect these studies and summarize the
findings and in such a way that

871
00:48:47,170 --> 00:48:50,300
you know maybe there's a little bit of
clustering in some in some

872
00:48:50,300 --> 00:48:53,730
part to the spectrum or other parts of
the spectrum and it would just be really

873
00:48:53,730 --> 00:48:54,460
interesting to

874
00:48:54,460 --> 00:48:59,210
to be able to see that but thats jack
and Kirstyn have been involved in arm

875
00:48:59,210 --> 00:48:59,520
with

876
00:48:59,520 --> 00:49:02,800
some studies at on the harvard Medical

877
00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:07,300
and those people argue that there years
a distinct difference in brain

878
00:49:07,300 --> 00:49:08,460
architecture

879
00:49:08,460 --> 00:49:14,180
of people on the spectrum verses nor a
typical stand and I don't know where

880
00:49:14,180 --> 00:49:17,950
other are you know where other folks
fall

881
00:49:17,950 --> 00:49:21,180
but they cannot talk about that bad
people with autism

882
00:49:21,180 --> 00:49:24,960
on like groundwork have higher neural
plasticity

883
00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:28,420
then articles and now can be used

884
00:49:28,420 --> 00:49:31,770
minutes for that in the future is
probably gonna be used in like

885
00:49:31,770 --> 00:49:32,720
diagnostics like

886
00:49:32,720 --> 00:49:35,950
that and alternatively like even just
using like fMRI

887
00:49:35,950 --> 00:49:40,390
there there's a bunch of magnetic
resonance imaging

888
00:49:40,390 --> 00:49:43,960
the budget and curable tests not
opinions that are

889
00:49:43,960 --> 00:49:47,150
very close to being you know completed
an approved

890
00:49:47,150 --> 00:49:50,170
yeah but what they found is that
wherever you lie on the spectrum

891
00:49:50,170 --> 00:49:53,800
nonlinear spectrum but like from the
high-functioning Aspergers too low

892
00:49:53,800 --> 00:49:55,170
functioning autism

893
00:49:55,170 --> 00:50:00,030
they have this shared your apostasy rate
and the doc something that is noticeably

894
00:50:00,030 --> 00:50:01,990
different no matter how home

895
00:50:01,990 --> 00:50:05,220
if affected you are whatever how
artistic you are there there are other

896
00:50:05,220 --> 00:50:06,310
theories to me.

897
00:50:06,310 --> 00:50:09,680
now this is something that is like
putting up artist developed in the early

898
00:50:09,680 --> 00:50:13,109
minutes left million misled Celeste
let's get the next

899
00:50:13,109 --> 00:50:17,590
question I found it to be a very
socially acceptable and parties to

900
00:50:17,590 --> 00:50:20,760
you know tell people I I'm horrible with
faces I'm gonna forget your name in five

901
00:50:20,760 --> 00:50:23,430
seconds please remind me three more
times

902
00:50:23,430 --> 00:50:26,700
in the next two minutes what remained
its yeah and then maybe I'll remember

903
00:50:26,700 --> 00:50:28,230
feel free to shame me after

904
00:50:28,230 --> 00:50:32,780
i'd like a comment about the talking you
know rapid monotone I wish the

905
00:50:32,780 --> 00:50:33,900
supermarket

906
00:50:33,900 --> 00:50:36,930
automated check codes would do that cuz
the slow

907
00:50:36,930 --> 00:50:40,490
paste infected tone wastes my time

908
00:50:40,490 --> 00:50:43,720
I like your official speech I

909
00:50:43,720 --> 00:50:48,370
we with regard to I contact and so forth
and no longer asked to do interviews at

910
00:50:48,370 --> 00:50:49,290
work because I'm

911
00:50:49,290 --> 00:50:53,460
either looking at my computer taking
notes as everything the candidate says

912
00:50:53,460 --> 00:50:57,220
or and touch typing and staring a hole
through the candidates for having me

913
00:50:57,220 --> 00:51:00,859
I if you can borrow techniques from

914
00:51:00,859 --> 00:51:04,490
police interrogation methods you can get
just the right now

915
00:51:04,490 --> 00:51:07,880
the right balance paying enough
attention to

916
00:51:07,880 --> 00:51:11,630
you know exert control over situation
but not so much that

917
00:51:11,630 --> 00:51:14,640
your your interlocutor chipset on you

918
00:51:14,640 --> 00:51:18,740
that mostly unsuccessful so you can you
can start

919
00:51:18,740 --> 00:51:22,450
like techniques from all over the place
as an academic I'm

920
00:51:22,450 --> 00:51:28,270
I'm penny used to now just looking at
the heads is just blobs

921
00:51:28,270 --> 00:51:32,200
its and now the so we have two more
questions

922
00:51:32,200 --> 00:51:35,310
and and that they'll have to be fast yet
so

923
00:51:35,310 --> 00:51:39,230
I have a I have a nine-year-old artistic
sign

924
00:51:39,230 --> 00:51:43,690
and he slick kind in the Middle East not
play low functioning not quite high

925
00:51:43,690 --> 00:51:44,410
functioning

926
00:51:44,410 --> 00:51:47,490
I was wondering arm from your experience
being

927
00:51:47,490 --> 00:51:50,640
with within the spectrum on what advice

928
00:51:50,640 --> 00:51:54,040
could you give for like adapting to a
world that's not really did

929
00:51:54,040 --> 00:51:57,450
bill for autism spectrum

930
00:51:57,450 --> 00:52:01,280
you know combat I think that's that
question's going to take long

931
00:52:01,280 --> 00:52:04,580
I 01 the one thing that you might be
your hardest problem

932
00:52:04,580 --> 00:52:07,950
20 closure all teachers make sure they
know what autism is and he's not just

933
00:52:07,950 --> 00:52:09,690
doing bad things on purpose

934
00:52:09,690 --> 00:52:12,820
goes because the school for that but
okay so in but

935
00:52:12,820 --> 00:52:16,160
I keep in mind that he's not always
gonna be a the way he is right now

936
00:52:16,160 --> 00:52:19,930
be parents get this idea lol he's at
this point this level is it just

937
00:52:19,930 --> 00:52:23,300
it's not a a static think I've seen the
main jobs but yeah

938
00:52:23,300 --> 00:52:27,859
my concern people's on change just
because even if you yeah yeah

939
00:52:27,859 --> 00:52:31,850
in the last question %uh hyatt's

940
00:52:31,850 --> 00:52:35,029
well on so it's not really a questions
more and

941
00:52:35,030 --> 00:52:38,220
some anecdotal something seconds
secondly

942
00:52:38,220 --> 00:52:42,380
I guess on the Nile I but okay so I he
spoke about

943
00:52:42,380 --> 00:52:45,390
other female a support network I didn't
have that

944
00:52:45,390 --> 00:52:49,589
on I didn't grow up with any real
network network outside here because

945
00:52:49,590 --> 00:52:53,000
on IM's Asian in a predominantly italian

946
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:56,100
like private Catholic school growing up
in the Jewish town next door

947
00:52:56,100 --> 00:52:59,150
and my parents were missionaries for
cult so I didn't on

948
00:52:59,150 --> 00:53:02,230
share I couldn't talk to anybody so I
said

949
00:53:02,230 --> 00:53:06,120
a lot of time reading books and I loved
books especially a lot of like

950
00:53:06,120 --> 00:53:09,569
these release reporting Salah the
science fiction and what not

951
00:53:09,570 --> 00:53:12,910
because fantasy books did not make sense
to me for the longest time because they

952
00:53:12,910 --> 00:53:14,600
try to connect with the emotional E

953
00:53:14,600 --> 00:53:17,440
and science fiction books there's a lot
of logic and reasoning a lot of

954
00:53:17,440 --> 00:53:18,140
potential

955
00:53:18,140 --> 00:53:21,480
sup that they like to explore any
explain this to use a lot of these

956
00:53:21,480 --> 00:53:23,310
things just make more sense

957
00:53:23,310 --> 00:53:26,720
intellectually as opposed to emotionally
um but I S

958
00:53:26,720 --> 00:53:31,050
but I guess fear on you connect talking
to a lot of weird people

959
00:53:31,050 --> 00:53:35,040
on that in order to track didn't even
have to learn these emotional

960
00:53:35,040 --> 00:53:39,300
roles so okay I'm throwing us their
tires on also before we go I just wanna

961
00:53:39,300 --> 00:53:42,870
say check out wrong planet that night
and please do not try to attack as far

962
00:53:42,870 --> 00:53:44,690
as you can only receive their

963
00:53:44,690 --> 00:53:48,500
yeah i turn my neck crop there's the
Women's Forum on wrong planet

964
00:53:48,500 --> 00:53:51,760
heard in for women's issues too

965
00:53:51,760 --> 00:53:57,829
grants

966
00:53:57,829 --> 00:54:00,380
well
