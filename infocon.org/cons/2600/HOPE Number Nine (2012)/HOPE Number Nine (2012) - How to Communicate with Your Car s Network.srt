1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:03,699
talk a little bit about how you can
connect to your car

2
00:00:03,699 --> 00:00:07,060
release that's the goal mom so what

3
00:00:07,060 --> 00:00:10,160
what I really do little bit introduction
by myself is a

4
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:14,519
I read bytes from the can-bus and your
vehicle how many people have cameras in

5
00:00:14,519 --> 00:00:16,730
their vehicle anybody know if they don't
want it

6
00:00:16,730 --> 00:00:21,130
alright so I'm excited to be very it's
gonna be ready tactical talk

7
00:00:21,130 --> 00:00:24,310
arm but it does have any questions
always you know

8
00:00:24,310 --> 00:00:28,359
feel free go to my website on campus had
to calm

9
00:00:28,359 --> 00:00:32,250
other go love my website really asserted
a couple years ago with the goal was to

10
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:35,980
just order introduce people to how to
get to their car how to get

11
00:00:35,980 --> 00:00:38,989
data from their car or interact with a
car

12
00:00:38,989 --> 00:00:42,149
is just a blog it's God's just has just
tax

13
00:00:42,149 --> 00:00:45,469
you know just redid sids it's kinda
funny sometimes

14
00:00:45,469 --> 00:00:49,219
so Iron Man and my twitter is I don't
weeks cuz I don't

15
00:00:49,219 --> 00:00:54,760
and you can gather post in this
presentation yet but I will

16
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:58,890
I'll probably buy it tonight this will
be you the the URL for its campus

17
00:00:58,890 --> 00:00:59,670
acecomm

18
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:03,940
hope worker I and I'm a talk a little
bit about

19
00:01:03,940 --> 00:01:07,119
some a program that I so little bit
about my background

20
00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:11,479
I've been work I work for the company
for about five years

21
00:01:11,479 --> 00:01:14,780
that was called in traffic control
systems

22
00:01:14,780 --> 00:01:19,150
they make tools to connect a vehicle at
work so that's where I got my sister

23
00:01:19,150 --> 00:01:22,890
and I'm a talk a bit about their their
software I don't work for them anymore

24
00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:26,250
work myself but I still really believe
in their software

25
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:31,990
they get excellent I am they have free
demo versions you can use to get started

26
00:01:31,990 --> 00:01:35,899
thus it's really a high cost of entry to
get into a lot of stuff I'll be honest

27
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:36,380
with you

28
00:01:36,380 --> 00:01:40,250
but I think there's ways to get around
that there's ways to find

29
00:01:40,250 --> 00:01:43,930
the you can find a way to get in into it
on

30
00:01:43,930 --> 00:01:49,240
just a starred hacking on your own car
so little introduction is a little

31
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:52,079
overview on talk about how to how to
connect to the vehicle

32
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:58,259
what's in the car will 2moro beatrice by
itself I am and looking at vs at the

33
00:01:58,259 --> 00:01:59,320
communications more

34
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:02,579
more not this offer but the
communication what they look like some

35
00:02:02,579 --> 00:02:04,280
other physical layers of the vehicle

36
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:08,160
arms is JT fifties are going back to
little bears what some people still have

37
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:09,609
the 250 in their car

38
00:02:09,610 --> 00:02:14,190
Lynn on my my talked about land but that
we talk about can-bus

39
00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:17,930
the different players again bus and the
devices that use to connect to it

40
00:02:17,930 --> 00:02:21,220
but the physical air on the frame

41
00:02:21,220 --> 00:02:25,760
I had a good guy had a demo but I'd I
didn't bring with me so I apologize

42
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:30,290
understand the data on the diagnostics
purses normal messages which is really

43
00:02:30,290 --> 00:02:31,650
important once we get into it

44
00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:35,260
um a little demo hope we can reverse
engineering we have time

45
00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:38,160
I know I'm at a run through these things
pretty fast cuz I have a whole bunch of

46
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:38,500
them

47
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:41,980
I diagnostic protocols if I can touch on
it

48
00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:46,760
obd2 a lot of people no love vehicle
network says obd2

49
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:50,280
but there's so much more that's really
just scratching the surface I'm a little

50
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:53,260
bit about Tom Summer Bird other
diagnostic protocols

51
00:02:53,260 --> 00:02:57,700
arms some called I saw ninety I so 14
tooth 229 I supported

52
00:02:57,700 --> 00:03:00,989
30 will be by Jim Landers GM and
diagnostics

53
00:03:00,989 --> 00:03:05,940
on diagnostic messages commanders at
such-and-such an ASM Q&A at the end

54
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:09,329
so that sometime so I little bit history

55
00:03:09,330 --> 00:03:12,930
how I started on RBN I sent out by
taking my

56
00:03:12,930 --> 00:03:16,690
Compaq PC and then putting it into my
civic

57
00:03:16,690 --> 00:03:20,750
courses wasn't it side on this wish

58
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:24,909
I heard and I you know I this is really
USA so this is my high school year in

59
00:03:24,909 --> 00:03:25,980
high school a lot of us

60
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:29,549
out here been working on it but these
things are well so I put computer

61
00:03:29,549 --> 00:03:34,200
in a car but the computer didn't talk
the car and that was really all tonight

62
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:38,560
my goal so I got into a website and a
brace from a with this website excellent

63
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:43,690
on website for you know trying to figure
out how to what tools to get mp3 car to

64
00:03:43,690 --> 00:03:46,370
comment start a long time ago on their
goals to merge

65
00:03:46,370 --> 00:03:50,180
computers and cars stuff like that and
that's how you can really get into

66
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:53,430
if you haven't been to their website
their forms they have a

67
00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:57,260
section just I'm diagnostics and two
controllers and different rosanna

68
00:03:57,260 --> 00:03:59,159
connectors excellent resources well

69
00:03:59,159 --> 00:04:04,239
com little bit about this is really
where it all starts and love you seen

70
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:04,489
this

71
00:04:04,459 --> 00:04:07,840
everybody wears 1996 or newer vehicle
has is in her car

72
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:13,040
this is the DLC obd2 connector able to:
slotted names that goes by

73
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:17,930
but every car in the meet me they're
sold in the United States and a lot of

74
00:04:17,930 --> 00:04:19,650
European cars as well

75
00:04:19,649 --> 00:04:22,810
have this connector are you can find it
underneath the dash just

76
00:04:22,810 --> 00:04:26,020
the old darkened that you had an eighth
where your steering wheel is

77
00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:29,979
and look for this car sometimes there's
a port where and this is

78
00:04:29,979 --> 00:04:33,090
the only two connector and it's designed

79
00:04:33,090 --> 00:04:36,710
primarily to be an interface for
scandals so when you're

80
00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:40,120
take your car to get serviced through
every that the diagnostic

81
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:43,690
dar were you in a performance
diagnostics nowadays all these controls

82
00:04:43,690 --> 00:04:45,410
on their those plugs thing in an hour

83
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:49,720
but it's so much more now they use this
also the engineers who are developing

84
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:50,560
the car

85
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:54,250
uses connectors well so a lot of the

86
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:57,460
diagnostic data is there but almost
never really there's a lot more

87
00:04:57,460 --> 00:04:59,659
information besides diagnostic

88
00:04:59,660 --> 00:05:04,910
so go to this go to this connector find
it and that's where you gonna start

89
00:05:04,910 --> 00:05:09,150
on what you will notice is that not all
the Pens are populated so 16 pins on the

90
00:05:09,150 --> 00:05:10,180
connector

91
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:13,770
just an effective but not all populated
so this actually gives you a lot of

92
00:05:13,770 --> 00:05:15,630
information about what networks

93
00:05:15,630 --> 00:05:18,680
are under car so if you see that pins

94
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:22,610
into was populated and you know that you
have

95
00:05:22,610 --> 00:05:26,220
if you look at europe into is the G 1850
in

96
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:29,789
are you know you have to 1850 on there
so you know you need a tool which 1850

97
00:05:29,789 --> 00:05:30,419
if you peace

98
00:05:30,419 --> 00:05:33,690
see pins a 16 14 yr there

99
00:05:33,690 --> 00:05:37,199
you know you have high speed can-bus see
you know you can get a campus tour

100
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:40,690
plug it in and size be care now there
are other pins with her

101
00:05:40,690 --> 00:05:45,229
call discretionary pins like pin wind up
in 311 or something like that

102
00:05:45,229 --> 00:05:48,849
is all discretionary pencil the audience
get whatever they wanna he spins

103
00:05:48,850 --> 00:05:53,240
their GM which had been one they put
their single where can

104
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:57,780
101 so they can do whatever they want
with these discretionary pins they can

105
00:05:57,780 --> 00:05:58,259
put

106
00:05:58,259 --> 00:06:01,610
you know obtain another power output
they can put

107
00:06:01,610 --> 00:06:04,759
no vehicle speed sensor like a pollster
something like that they can do whatever

108
00:06:04,759 --> 00:06:05,560
they want

109
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:09,370
I'm you can also get the spin-out from
pinouts are you very good resource for

110
00:06:09,370 --> 00:06:09,930
denounced

111
00:06:09,930 --> 00:06:13,690
ever been around I so this is a really

112
00:06:13,690 --> 00:06:17,539
this is the most important part arm but

113
00:06:17,539 --> 00:06:21,050
given that you have you may have more

114
00:06:21,050 --> 00:06:25,280
networks on your card then what's an
this connector this connectors for

115
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:26,430
diagnostics

116
00:06:26,430 --> 00:06:30,289
and some manufactures decide that you
are certain networks don't need to be

117
00:06:30,289 --> 00:06:31,349
put out here

118
00:06:31,350 --> 00:06:35,220
and the reason is there's a couple
reasons one is they don't want

119
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:38,660
deal people like us to connect to the
network they wanna make a difficult

120
00:06:38,660 --> 00:06:39,759
little more difficult

121
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:43,199
but mainly the reason is they

122
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:47,039
don't there's no tool that needs a
cactus or wire on route the wire

123
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:50,560
all the way to hear you know there's no
reason for so they just

124
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:54,009
they don't waste the time spent time
there move on so

125
00:06:54,009 --> 00:06:57,370
you may have to go to other web sites to
try to find

126
00:06:57,370 --> 00:07:01,120
you know body control module swear your
body control module was located in your

127
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:03,069
car and find the body networks cuz

128
00:07:03,069 --> 00:07:06,690
typically there are two networks in your
car and

129
00:07:06,690 --> 00:07:11,009
if you have a newer car and the body meh
the body controller has

130
00:07:11,009 --> 00:07:14,360
almost all of them on there so try to
find a product or so little bit about

131
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:15,050
what's

132
00:07:15,050 --> 00:07:18,259
what is in the car like on little bit
about

133
00:07:18,259 --> 00:07:22,000
how the CAN bus and why the campus
really exists

134
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:26,650
so you may find that the air conditioner
module Missy position module on the

135
00:07:26,650 --> 00:07:29,620
transmission and a controller all
connected via can-bus

136
00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:33,990
see have all the systems connected and
they're all controllers so they have a

137
00:07:33,990 --> 00:07:34,860
lot of bio

138
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:38,620
connected and actually actuating the
engine you know the timing on the engine

139
00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:40,500
to transmission and when it ships

140
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:43,789
all these controller sitting here and
they're all connected to a single

141
00:07:43,789 --> 00:07:45,409
network is typically the campus

142
00:07:45,410 --> 00:07:48,410
in the reason why the use the canvas is
because it's a very well

143
00:07:48,410 --> 00:07:51,479
but not very fast but relatively fast
compared to other technologies that are

144
00:07:51,479 --> 00:07:52,080
out there

145
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:55,599
today they are moving away a little bit
French control systems

146
00:07:55,599 --> 00:07:59,550
from can bust because they're coming up
with the faster newer systems

147
00:07:59,550 --> 00:08:03,349
but campuses very much prevalent and in
cars today

148
00:08:03,349 --> 00:08:06,210
and I do I think it's gonna be there for
a long time just because its nature now

149
00:08:06,210 --> 00:08:07,470
talk love or about

150
00:08:07,470 --> 00:08:10,750
why that is a little bit later

151
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:13,800
so I miss you a little bit so I'm I love

152
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:17,699
what can bust might look like so I'll
bring up vehicles by

153
00:08:17,699 --> 00:08:20,789
here so this is the

154
00:08:20,789 --> 00:08:24,568
vehicle spices offer that I use pretty
much done a daily basis

155
00:08:24,569 --> 00:08:28,470
and just to give you an idea this its
you know a lot of first use proper use

156
00:08:28,470 --> 00:08:28,849
like

157
00:08:28,849 --> 00:08:32,200
Wireshark and the system similar concept

158
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:35,510
it shows the actual drawing information
on the

159
00:08:35,510 --> 00:08:38,539
on the bus arm and I'll show you exited
in a

160
00:08:38,539 --> 00:08:41,949
mrow a hex so

161
00:08:41,950 --> 00:08:45,390
if we look at this we can see like this
is actually a reflash event that

162
00:08:45,390 --> 00:08:48,069
occurred on my vehicle i reflash the

163
00:08:48,070 --> 00:08:52,589
transmission controller in on this is
the fuel control module so we can see

164
00:08:52,589 --> 00:08:56,649
even even when we're looking at this
data we can see that

165
00:08:56,649 --> 00:09:01,269
that you know we have of rain this is
what a frame missus editor

166
00:09:01,269 --> 00:09:04,519
identify your and then a bike today to
thats can-bus

167
00:09:04,519 --> 00:09:07,580
data fire at a bite to data could be
less could be more

168
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:11,959
but that's it really short succinct
messages they go out so it's rather

169
00:09:11,959 --> 00:09:15,899
I mean if we compare this to like
Ethernet ther anything like that these

170
00:09:15,899 --> 00:09:18,779
messages are very simple very concise

171
00:09:18,779 --> 00:09:23,779
and the idea is we're trying diff hair
have like very short messages that live

172
00:09:23,779 --> 00:09:24,810
very quickly

173
00:09:24,810 --> 00:09:29,110
but there's a lot of data an updated
contained inside a tease

174
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:32,830
on tell these messages so that it can

175
00:09:32,830 --> 00:09:36,870
your do whatever it is you like okay the
temperature the engine is this

176
00:09:36,870 --> 00:09:40,610
book done just to buy today to one by
today that's all you need

177
00:09:40,610 --> 00:09:43,560
there now you now everybody on the
network has an information we can move

178
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:44,800
on to the next

179
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:48,450
next thing on this is a gallery flash
events are going to see a lot more data

180
00:09:48,450 --> 00:09:49,120
here

181
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:52,300
but you see id very simple

182
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:56,310
very simple to use very easy to
understand not super complicated

183
00:09:56,310 --> 00:09:59,420
but there's a lot of different formats
these messages as well

184
00:09:59,420 --> 00:10:02,420
on if you look at the date it actually
can go by pretty cool

185
00:10:02,420 --> 00:10:07,439
course year you know it's gonna happen a
hacer

186
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:11,390
I was gonna say yeah going by a little
bit making a run past but of course it's

187
00:10:11,390 --> 00:10:12,029
gonna fail

188
00:10:12,029 --> 00:10:15,170
on so let's see

189
00:10:15,170 --> 00:10:19,269
its again can-bus communications
originally originally designed

190
00:10:19,269 --> 00:10:22,700
you know more to decrease the wearing
size imagine that you wanted to share

191
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:25,540
the engine speed with other controllers
you know

192
00:10:25,540 --> 00:10:28,610
you have this this a radio

193
00:10:28,610 --> 00:10:32,160
and you know I like people have this
feature on their car you driving on the

194
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:33,120
road the radio source

195
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:36,769
divall you increases as you're driving
is bad maybe your vehicle speed or

196
00:10:36,769 --> 00:10:37,880
something like that

197
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:41,760
and these are the types of features that
they stay at it in before the head

198
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:45,189
I your vehicle networks is really
cumbersome because they run a vehicle

199
00:10:45,190 --> 00:10:46,019
speed-sensitive

200
00:10:46,019 --> 00:10:50,450
every every can't every controller
radioed the

201
00:10:50,450 --> 00:10:52,970
the engine that all these different
things had to know what the vehicle

202
00:10:52,970 --> 00:10:53,839
speed was

203
00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:58,010
well they took that concept obviously
put on a canvas and said hey we're gonna

204
00:10:58,010 --> 00:11:02,670
distribute this data now across that now
we can use that information

205
00:11:02,670 --> 00:11:06,790
and we can record bigsby now weather for
whatever reason we want people to be we

206
00:11:06,790 --> 00:11:07,849
can have it now

207
00:11:07,850 --> 00:11:11,829
but of course there's two ways to get
the day not talked a bit about that

208
00:11:11,829 --> 00:11:15,610
those later so subtle about the physical
layers themselves there's the old

209
00:11:15,610 --> 00:11:21,279
the old in the new solicitor 1850 I us
more

210
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:24,709
talk a little bit about canvas canvas
hack but JT fifties really where it all

211
00:11:24,709 --> 00:11:26,720
began please the US

212
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:32,860
on there's two different versions as
variables with the balls with modulation

213
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:36,970
there's Lynn we have this is a newer
network I saw 9141

214
00:11:36,970 --> 00:11:40,029
there's can talk about different flavors
newer

215
00:11:40,029 --> 00:11:43,899
I am a newer type of fun serial data
network is them

216
00:11:43,899 --> 00:11:47,480
most certainly oriented serial transfers
really use for

217
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:50,540
media as you can imagine Canada's ironic
name for bird

218
00:11:50,540 --> 00:11:54,380
use for me complex rate which is a new

219
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:58,389
very much faster and I see faster it's
really only up till like

220
00:11:58,389 --> 00:12:01,899
5 make per second but her just a lot

221
00:12:01,899 --> 00:12:06,880
a lot faster for vehicle data there's
argues that in some more European

222
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:07,910
vehicles already

223
00:12:07,910 --> 00:12:11,410
B&W on and then there's been which is

224
00:12:11,410 --> 00:12:15,089
Toyota still uses their all archaic
network

225
00:12:15,089 --> 00:12:19,810
I did 50 has to wear differential
signaling

226
00:12:19,810 --> 00:12:23,209
I'm its on pins to Anna to in 10 if
you're

227
00:12:23,209 --> 00:12:26,620
take a look at your body to connect urge
take a look at it say oh I have been so

228
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:27,320
intense

229
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:30,880
you're on a Ford vehicle of course
because the port is only one that uses

230
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:31,439
the

231
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:34,540
PWM to 250 it's also known as

232
00:12:34,540 --> 00:12:37,699
SEP I M

233
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:41,720
it's really old and no longer in use you
won't find

234
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:45,670
you'll find 1850 PWM on any vehicles
then

235
00:12:45,670 --> 00:12:49,079
I there's bbw which uses just as in
words

236
00:12:49,079 --> 00:12:52,200
GM is the really the the main user

237
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:55,880
a crisis you use it as well it's just
something to so if you take a look at

238
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:57,070
you just have been to

239
00:12:57,070 --> 00:13:01,920
there no in ten your honor GM or
Chrysler vehicle has a 250 so take a

240
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:02,260
look

241
00:13:02,260 --> 00:13:05,620
can you confided arm

242
00:13:05,620 --> 00:13:09,519
now we talked a bit about canvas I
defined by Bausch

243
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:14,260
so very large privately held company did
hadn't had the new original need

244
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:17,889
they made it they make educate roles
typically so because they make these

245
00:13:17,889 --> 00:13:18,660
high-speed

246
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:21,660
they need this high-speed data that's
very reliable

247
00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:24,910
so they decided that they were going to
come up with their own

248
00:13:24,910 --> 00:13:28,600
system and fortunately did because it's
actually very very good

249
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:32,480
there are two types there's a two
versions such as a

250
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:37,100
2.08 we'll be and there are two types
the monikers are usually

251
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:41,360
2.0 days of of to refer to the lavender
and then there's 29 did

252
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:44,579
and this is really refers to the
arbitration ID on which is the

253
00:13:44,579 --> 00:13:46,279
identifiers every frame

254
00:13:46,279 --> 00:13:50,970
God back here this is the identify
rehear the center column

255
00:13:50,970 --> 00:13:55,290
this'll be there 11 but I D so free book
but how many bits there were

256
00:13:55,290 --> 00:13:58,839
rigid there's a lot bits am some the

257
00:13:58,839 --> 00:14:02,709
some vehicles very rarely have 29 did
ID's larger ID's

258
00:14:02,709 --> 00:14:06,740
you can do a little more ID's are as far
as like segmenting and

259
00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:09,860
the messages that you send our

260
00:14:09,860 --> 00:14:13,070
I am it's really good for real time
systems

261
00:14:13,070 --> 00:14:17,459
some very low latency I you just you
send the message out

262
00:14:17,459 --> 00:14:21,170
if you're talking about most vehicles
are we are running about five hundred

263
00:14:21,170 --> 00:14:22,230
kilobits per second

264
00:14:22,230 --> 00:14:26,190
really super fast leasing you know 500
kilobits per second

265
00:14:26,190 --> 00:14:30,350
and but you know these messages if you
think about on a bike frame

266
00:14:30,350 --> 00:14:33,980
goes out if I would kill bits per second
it only takes about 280

267
00:14:33,980 --> 00:14:37,260
microseconds for to be on the bus and
then it's gonna next one

268
00:14:37,260 --> 00:14:40,920
has time so if you think about all the
information you back into two hundred

269
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:43,089
makes its really fast really quick

270
00:14:43,089 --> 00:14:46,040
and then you have this you know all
these other controllers concert was

271
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:47,750
really close to real time

272
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:50,959
very useful there are there are three
different physical layers in this is

273
00:14:50,959 --> 00:14:54,459
really I think probably the most
important thing for somebody who's new

274
00:14:54,459 --> 00:14:58,220
trying to understand aggressor grasp the
concept canvas

275
00:14:58,220 --> 00:15:02,079
is there's three different types are
single where can faltan can and do work

276
00:15:02,079 --> 00:15:02,930
and

277
00:15:02,930 --> 00:15:06,360
do work and is really the one everybody
knows when they're

278
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:09,269
when if you raise your hand earlier as
if you were cameras as you know about

279
00:15:09,269 --> 00:15:11,310
your can probably is rooted

280
00:15:11,310 --> 00:15:14,860
but there's actually two other flavors I
think they're just as much fun

281
00:15:14,860 --> 00:15:18,730
I'm excess you get an air card to try to
hack anyone I like

282
00:15:18,730 --> 00:15:22,329
figured out but the problem is there's
just no good hardware out there for the

283
00:15:22,329 --> 00:15:23,120
other two

284
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:28,010
the do work and 80-90 percent involved
can tools that you use can bust

285
00:15:28,010 --> 00:15:31,350
can device that you can buy offline on
minor whatever

286
00:15:31,350 --> 00:15:36,190
am any the Arduino shields that you may
find they're all using this to work and

287
00:15:36,190 --> 00:15:36,990
which is

288
00:15:36,990 --> 00:15:40,490
I'll talk about all over later a little
remorse specifics

289
00:15:40,490 --> 00:15:43,529
but I'm they're seeing where 10

290
00:15:43,529 --> 00:15:47,329
really only a couple tools I can't think
Ive not use that

291
00:15:47,329 --> 00:15:51,180
actually interface with their and arm

292
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:54,709
lost people Tarkan as well which is this

293
00:15:54,709 --> 00:15:58,070
more European I you see Chrysler

294
00:15:58,070 --> 00:16:01,209
VW Mercedes and some in the new york
years

295
00:16:01,209 --> 00:16:05,240
are using this this network but this is
these two are really designed for body

296
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:06,750
networks are much lower

297
00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:10,529
but they're very they're just as much
fun if not more salt october bouncing

298
00:16:10,529 --> 00:16:11,509
work against

299
00:16:11,509 --> 00:16:15,399
because everybody's religious center so
a develop a GM

300
00:16:15,399 --> 00:16:18,649
on it's found you know really I N

301
00:16:18,649 --> 00:16:23,240
your even some older hunters as well
sorry GM has in some the older honda's

302
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:27,370
have seen work and GM you if you have a
gf General Motors car take a look at

303
00:16:27,370 --> 00:16:29,209
your already to connector

304
00:16:29,209 --> 00:16:33,889
if you have something in pin 1 on a
connector you have seen where can

305
00:16:33,889 --> 00:16:38,329
ice time to go find a tool that texting
work and as you so much

306
00:16:38,329 --> 00:16:41,810
so much stuff Johnson work energy a
Honda has it as well

307
00:16:41,810 --> 00:16:45,779
on I replaced JT 50

308
00:16:45,779 --> 00:16:49,029
its limit faster it's arm its

309
00:16:49,029 --> 00:16:54,439
really known as the body bus really you
only have body control functions on it

310
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:59,550
very low cost center but much lower rate
as you can see is 33 killed it

311
00:16:59,550 --> 00:17:03,560
33.3 33 actually kilobits per second

312
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:07,449
on JT 50 I'm serious

313
00:17:07,449 --> 00:17:11,140
as a respect GE 2411

314
00:17:11,140 --> 00:17:14,220
has up to 60 meters in length typically
is your Bible

315
00:17:14,220 --> 00:17:17,770
a signaling level so if you are using
like a logic analyzer

316
00:17:17,770 --> 00:17:21,910
to look at the data arm you can use a
standard logic analyzer

317
00:17:21,910 --> 00:17:25,890
was your but was too much to handle the
revival some problem

318
00:17:25,890 --> 00:17:29,539
I'm does have a high voltage mode pretty
quick

319
00:17:29,539 --> 00:17:33,320
so it any logic analyzer wouldn't win
her

320
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:38,090
on and very much the most fun networks
that you can act really because there's

321
00:17:38,090 --> 00:17:38,918
just so much

322
00:17:38,919 --> 00:17:42,400
information on there is so much control
or your car on

323
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:46,299
fault-tolerant I still suspect 11e 1190

324
00:17:46,299 --> 00:17:50,900
dash 3 body at work again on is a
two-word network

325
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:54,100
laos for the loss one a least one other
number

326
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:57,419
one of the wires that's why they call it
a fault on a network so you can come on

327
00:17:57,419 --> 00:17:59,160
where it still works

328
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:02,390
this is really good if you're trying to
like you know figure out how to hack are

329
00:18:02,390 --> 00:18:04,539
you just need to find one wire insulator
to

330
00:18:04,539 --> 00:18:08,080
you wanna packet from the outside I am

331
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:11,649
to moderates there they are am and its

332
00:18:11,650 --> 00:18:15,559
practically never almost nearly never
found on the obd2 port so this is one of

333
00:18:15,559 --> 00:18:18,200
those networks that if you really wanted
to connect to it

334
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:21,669
really gotta find it you gonna head
start again through wiring diagrams et

335
00:18:21,669 --> 00:18:22,450
cetera

336
00:18:22,450 --> 00:18:25,789
and you can look for an average you
won't find an image works ever on the

337
00:18:25,789 --> 00:18:27,940
Fiat 500 which I found it there

338
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:31,600
very strange whisper on

339
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:36,679
do where can on my soul 11.08.09 a dish
to you also known as G true to me

340
00:18:36,679 --> 00:18:41,309
for so if you want to look up the specs
because it was really expects are most

341
00:18:41,309 --> 00:18:44,490
prevalent version like this message
before them can-bus

342
00:18:44,490 --> 00:18:48,010
on this decade it technically will
support up to when the whole megabyte

343
00:18:48,010 --> 00:18:49,360
per second

344
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:54,919
I'm I know 'em but you'll really find it
around 500 kilobits per seconds

345
00:18:54,919 --> 00:18:58,890
and the reason for that is you know they
just don't need to set it a lot actually

346
00:18:58,890 --> 00:19:00,530
just add another

347
00:19:00,530 --> 00:19:04,860
can that work if they need more
bandwidth on the figures easier and

348
00:19:04,860 --> 00:19:09,059
1 megabit the really have tested a
little bit on some vehicles and

349
00:19:09,059 --> 00:19:13,330
an extra capacity in san n course
anytime you talking about speed you have

350
00:19:13,330 --> 00:19:13,760
that

351
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:16,789
distance trade off so they want to make
the the can-bus

352
00:19:16,789 --> 00:19:20,879
longer well they can make it as long the
faster they make it so we have a little

353
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:21,470
bit

354
00:19:21,470 --> 00:19:24,309
it is a differential I'm so if you're
looking up like an oscilloscope

355
00:19:24,309 --> 00:19:27,600
something like that you can switch it to
different shimon

356
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:31,100
on it does shield against him I just
like your

357
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:35,250
fun internet on fun in 1614

358
00:19:35,250 --> 00:19:39,200
so that's where you look when you're
ready to connect a reminder for 1614 s

359
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:40,890
gonna be where high-speed canopies

360
00:19:40,890 --> 00:19:45,110
there may also be another one on 311 so
look there as well

361
00:19:45,110 --> 00:19:49,070
Tom Ford asserted use that it's been 11
so you can work

362
00:19:49,070 --> 00:19:52,200
you can take in its the same physical
layer as

363
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:56,450
as you'll find in 614 so the same tool
that you use to collect it

364
00:19:56,450 --> 00:20:00,750
you know 614 you can order 311 the work
they may be different bader its lead

365
00:20:00,750 --> 00:20:02,720
player on a little better

366
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:06,280
it will that work arm really just
typically a powertrain

367
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:10,129
applications typically so that's where
you where you're going to find their

368
00:20:10,130 --> 00:20:14,620
20 arms a little bit about that so
summer devices you could use

369
00:20:14,620 --> 00:20:18,299
arm I have an old one but here it is my
old

370
00:20:18,299 --> 00:20:21,320
a Arduino shield from escape paying

371
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:24,658
than the new ones a spark on 1x every
picture a little bit later

372
00:20:24,659 --> 00:20:29,770
use legislator I M so she looks like but
they do have a Arduino shield for its

373
00:20:29,770 --> 00:20:30,679
150 bucks

374
00:20:30,679 --> 00:20:34,590
just supports again to work and so if
you're working with that you can work on

375
00:20:34,590 --> 00:20:35,649
some of the cool ones

376
00:20:35,650 --> 00:20:41,070
a.m. that and the nearby rebel you can
this is the the companies to work for in

377
00:20:41,070 --> 00:20:42,360
her control systems

378
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:46,490
this is very expensive as you can see by
1200 two thousand dollars

379
00:20:46,490 --> 00:20:50,530
extremely high you know for it for this
guy but the valley cans a little bit

380
00:20:50,530 --> 00:20:52,470
more reasonable there are can USB

381
00:20:52,470 --> 00:20:56,000
ease and stuff like that out there a
cheaper but you don't get the advantage

382
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,150
of the software

383
00:20:57,150 --> 00:21:00,390
which you can get like a demo version as
well heard

384
00:21:00,390 --> 00:21:04,150
even a free version detective retrievers
as well is really helpful

385
00:21:04,150 --> 00:21:08,309
mom and your engineering tool really
that's really where they sell

386
00:21:08,309 --> 00:21:11,539
their their their tools for the engineer
so

387
00:21:11,539 --> 00:21:15,850
you gets the same two lawyers engineers
the guys I G and the guys aggressors

388
00:21:15,850 --> 00:21:16,409
archer

389
00:21:16,409 --> 00:21:19,929
the more costly and then of course
there's a company called down

390
00:21:19,929 --> 00:21:23,580
that makes the makes a tools for scan
tools

391
00:21:23,580 --> 00:21:27,220
whose here's the home known chipset them

392
00:21:27,220 --> 00:21:30,539
sports all the obd2 protocols yes
disorder

393
00:21:30,539 --> 00:21:33,860
you know make your own as the chip
itself here too you know cobble together

394
00:21:33,860 --> 00:21:34,679
your own

395
00:21:34,679 --> 00:21:38,140
devices buds AT commands I am

396
00:21:38,140 --> 00:21:42,059
it will cost lead for high you know
high-volume implementations

397
00:21:42,059 --> 00:21:46,330
but they're the good news is respond a
little clones out there as well to that

398
00:21:46,330 --> 00:21:49,740
so it's a very defective standard for
creating

399
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:53,809
and talking to you know you can bust so
there's lots of her out there that's

400
00:21:53,809 --> 00:21:55,940
based off the on protocol as well

401
00:21:55,940 --> 00:22:00,070
so you can you know get this free
applications that can talk to your own

402
00:22:00,070 --> 00:22:03,139
around based devices well back to have
one with me know

403
00:22:03,140 --> 00:22:06,390
show it to anybody want to see
afterwards on

404
00:22:06,390 --> 00:22:10,130
so little bit about the physical layer
itself cuz girl but she keeps

405
00:22:10,130 --> 00:22:14,570
so we love we were physical layer on its
twisted pair some reason

406
00:22:14,570 --> 00:22:18,250
am it does and this is probably if you
are making if your gonna go home you

407
00:22:18,250 --> 00:22:19,970
wanna make your own campus network
assess

408
00:22:19,970 --> 00:22:23,440
from sure everybody's gonna do after
this is gonna make the engine was a word

409
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:26,730
you will have to make sure that the most
important thing you can do is

410
00:22:26,730 --> 00:22:30,250
put 120 ohm resistor between can I am no

411
00:22:30,250 --> 00:22:34,059
I and by the end of your campus so to
make a long string

412
00:22:34,059 --> 00:22:37,760
this is the the number one thing I hear
about from everybody talks talks measly

413
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:40,289
I get a cut in all up it's perfect

414
00:22:40,289 --> 00:22:44,190
I've had my own campus on my desk and of
course

415
00:22:44,190 --> 00:22:48,039
input resistors therein and nothing
worked because

416
00:22:48,039 --> 00:22:51,220
you know the you made it two antennas

417
00:22:51,220 --> 00:22:54,559
now they're just they're just too big
antennas know but there is a stunner so

418
00:22:54,559 --> 00:22:56,720
you gotta put in there now you have a
bus

419
00:22:56,720 --> 00:23:01,429
differential signal and can have up to
two 2 30 notes

420
00:23:01,429 --> 00:23:05,679
just wires is to copper wires is run
yacht with them if you want to don't was

421
00:23:05,679 --> 00:23:07,380
with you don't want to its up to you

422
00:23:07,380 --> 00:23:10,630
iron remember but the %uh the length is
really

423
00:23:10,630 --> 00:23:14,169
up the baud rate versus like the problem
so yet as everyone's radar

424
00:23:14,169 --> 00:23:17,840
so don't make it too long but you know
if it's ten meters is going to be a

425
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:18,379
problem

426
00:23:18,380 --> 00:23:21,380
for even the best scam a city can sell
it to you

427
00:23:21,380 --> 00:23:25,230
so you know it's pretty simple I a
little bit about the data frame itself

428
00:23:25,230 --> 00:23:28,330
actually gave a better

429
00:23:28,330 --> 00:23:32,610
used here so that the middle one is
obviously an oscilloscope you

430
00:23:32,610 --> 00:23:35,780
above can frame you notices

431
00:23:35,780 --> 00:23:39,370
its it's not like just bite bite bite
know here's one by

432
00:23:39,370 --> 00:23:42,960
is not a break because nobody saw
stacked next to each other it's actually

433
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:48,070
really well engineered to support all
the requirements for campus as we fast

434
00:23:48,070 --> 00:23:49,010
reliable

435
00:23:49,010 --> 00:23:52,379
and all those must you'll be able to
read

436
00:23:52,380 --> 00:23:56,799
the data as well so you look here in I
think we have a starter frame and banner

437
00:23:56,799 --> 00:24:00,730
arbitration field gotta control fielder
tells us the

438
00:24:00,730 --> 00:24:04,000
did a link that such her on Buford

439
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:07,820
data bytes girls in their test CRC is
pretty good

440
00:24:07,820 --> 00:24:11,360
robust here see 15 bids you know
considering the size of the day the

441
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:13,580
mondale you can put in it 15 bids as

442
00:24:13,580 --> 00:24:17,949
significant an act field any under frame

443
00:24:17,950 --> 00:24:21,500
%uh so it's its really simple

444
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:24,970
easy to understand that a lot now very
convoluted you know just have a few

445
00:24:24,970 --> 00:24:26,940
things you learn once you learn them

446
00:24:26,940 --> 00:24:30,070
you know you're in good shape stars

447
00:24:30,070 --> 00:24:34,250
trying to figure out that so again I
told Germany's talk a little about their

448
00:24:34,250 --> 00:24:37,809
to reno shield being guess parkrun on

449
00:24:37,809 --> 00:24:41,450
again don't forget those resistors if
you can make your own

450
00:24:41,450 --> 00:24:44,529
network the good news is if you connect
to a vehicle

451
00:24:44,529 --> 00:24:47,580
there are there already there the right
way but it's a fully functional

452
00:24:47,580 --> 00:24:51,549
on campus so that's better

453
00:24:51,549 --> 00:24:56,158
IRS the nearby to show you a bit earlier
does have an obd2 cable is connected to

454
00:24:56,159 --> 00:24:58,450
the obd2 port

455
00:24:58,450 --> 00:25:01,830
arm diagnostics personal messages so

456
00:25:01,830 --> 00:25:05,250
win when I talk to a lot of my

457
00:25:05,250 --> 00:25:08,390
Mike my customers and I work with what

458
00:25:08,390 --> 00:25:11,960
on a daily basis the the really it this
is the most

459
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:15,120
this is the thing that educate more
people on anything

460
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:18,240
is the difference between diagnostic
information

461
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:21,380
been get from the vehicle verses what's
called normal messages which is the

462
00:25:21,380 --> 00:25:23,600
information it just flows from
controller to control

463
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:27,679
controller you have to do anything it's
just as good stream data

464
00:25:27,679 --> 00:25:31,010
now with Diagnostics is a strict
protocol on

465
00:25:31,010 --> 00:25:34,539
being in what's what's interesting about
it is its strict to

466
00:25:34,539 --> 00:25:39,559
the particular OEM typically so GM will
have their diagnostic protocol price

467
00:25:39,559 --> 00:25:40,720
/url bears

468
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:44,150
they're all really based upon the scene
thing that's like it's like a

469
00:25:44,150 --> 00:25:47,720
thing about %uh Latin based you know
there's a scene this is one unifying

470
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:48,590
document that

471
00:25:48,590 --> 00:25:52,240
that was created first then everybody to
spy on their own

472
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:55,370
I am diagnostic protocol base after that

473
00:25:55,370 --> 00:25:58,740
they're all really somewhere once you
learn one to learn the other is very

474
00:25:58,740 --> 00:25:59,900
very simple

475
00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:04,860
but it's very strict I am L you know the
arbitration Eddie means this

476
00:26:04,860 --> 00:26:08,270
the date first day to buy it means this
the second intimate means this

477
00:26:08,270 --> 00:26:11,539
so that's very strict protocol and its
you know if you go to work

478
00:26:11,539 --> 00:26:15,539
Geo 2000 chrysler to a 2012 Chrysler

479
00:26:15,539 --> 00:26:19,679
that protocol so same hasn't changed and
you know you can

480
00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:23,799
bingo you may be a couple years before
that hasn't changed it's always the same

481
00:26:23,799 --> 00:26:28,039
on it's used by the schedules rate so
they have this

482
00:26:28,039 --> 00:26:31,740
their Williams make their own each a Wii
and has our own scant

483
00:26:31,740 --> 00:26:35,659
that's for that REM answer all your
specific skin to all the other ships

484
00:26:35,659 --> 00:26:36,809
have one

485
00:26:36,809 --> 00:26:40,549
I'm anybody wants to work on a car that
you know has the money

486
00:26:40,549 --> 00:26:44,539
as well as the as well so because in
that they don't wanna change the

487
00:26:44,539 --> 00:26:47,250
software that often so they keep very
strict protocols

488
00:26:47,250 --> 00:26:50,770
very tight and they don't change things
much less they need to change like

489
00:26:50,770 --> 00:26:54,690
obviously there's gotta be something
different on a hybrid vehicle that you

490
00:26:54,690 --> 00:26:56,429
don't need to get on a regular

491
00:26:56,429 --> 00:27:00,700
in on hybrid so you know they might add
things for that but

492
00:27:00,700 --> 00:27:04,480
other than that everything is really
backwards compatible as best as they can

493
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:07,630
so once you learn one thing and one
vehicle probably the same like

494
00:27:07,630 --> 00:27:12,070
on the other vehicles no much difference
so as a command in response

495
00:27:12,070 --> 00:27:16,039
as well so that means is the scan tool
sends out a message

496
00:27:16,039 --> 00:27:19,179
to the car and then the car response
back that simple

497
00:27:19,179 --> 00:27:23,630
and every message that as diagnostics it
always works in that same flow

498
00:27:23,630 --> 00:27:27,539
the skin to request information the car
response get to request a response

499
00:27:27,539 --> 00:27:31,610
request/response so I am you don't we

500
00:27:31,610 --> 00:27:35,549
we have we can ask for you know what's
this data value was a very what's a

501
00:27:35,549 --> 00:27:36,340
stated value

502
00:27:36,340 --> 00:27:39,870
what is it and then it responds and if
you know the scaling is there's a lot of

503
00:27:39,870 --> 00:27:41,250
when as a returns back issues

504
00:27:41,250 --> 00:27:44,760
access most of the talking engines beers
in like that you have to rescale it

505
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:47,919
if you are scaling a bet you can do
yourself from your own trials

506
00:27:47,919 --> 00:27:51,149
you know I can mimic the scan tool
exactly what it's doing

507
00:27:51,149 --> 00:27:55,520
on whereas we take that in contrast with
normal messages are

508
00:27:55,520 --> 00:28:00,139
are no messages really are just these
messages that are just being sent

509
00:28:00,140 --> 00:28:04,429
no engine speed is gonna be sent the
throttle position the temperature

510
00:28:04,429 --> 00:28:07,770
maybe twerk requests things like that

511
00:28:07,770 --> 00:28:11,240
for one controller its broadcast it out
to the other controllers but

512
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:14,250
the only reason why ever have to
broadcast it out because somebody else's

513
00:28:14,250 --> 00:28:14,779
listing

514
00:28:14,779 --> 00:28:18,000
so if you think about it like why would
the

515
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:22,190
engine arenas started not everything
about this way but while the engine need

516
00:28:22,190 --> 00:28:25,149
to share information about its mass air
flow

517
00:28:25,149 --> 00:28:28,870
right so because it does need to share
that information second senator

518
00:28:28,870 --> 00:28:32,419
so the only way to get it through
diagrams the requests using a scan tool

519
00:28:32,419 --> 00:28:34,120
or something like that

520
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:38,179
so even if so there's something that you
wanted like mass air flow or some sort

521
00:28:38,179 --> 00:28:39,580
of parameter that really

522
00:28:39,580 --> 00:28:43,699
only needs to be stuck inside and one
controller handles itself internally

523
00:28:43,700 --> 00:28:44,730
nobody needs to be

524
00:28:44,730 --> 00:28:48,100
have that information it's going to be
only accessible through diagnostic

525
00:28:48,100 --> 00:28:48,620
message

526
00:28:48,620 --> 00:28:53,429
messages if you're lucky most the time
it is but it's only gonna be there so

527
00:28:53,429 --> 00:28:56,899
when you plug a tool in like this new
buyer this

528
00:28:56,899 --> 00:29:01,039
this year either one of these devices
you put them in I'm your biggest remove

529
00:29:01,039 --> 00:29:04,270
data that's gonna come across these are
normal messages

530
00:29:04,270 --> 00:29:07,529
you're gonna get that information but
the only thing that's in there is going

531
00:29:07,529 --> 00:29:08,360
to be

532
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:12,059
information that needs to be shared
monks controllers

533
00:29:12,059 --> 00:29:17,070
with that also means is as the vehicles
change in as information that needs to

534
00:29:17,070 --> 00:29:18,370
be shared changes

535
00:29:18,370 --> 00:29:21,659
that information changes so it's not
going to be consistent throughout the

536
00:29:21,659 --> 00:29:22,360
years

537
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:25,429
effect probably every two to three years
are going to find its can be completely

538
00:29:25,429 --> 00:29:26,350
different

539
00:29:26,350 --> 00:29:29,590
so normal messages also have things like

540
00:29:29,590 --> 00:29:33,039
are but this is really where the fun is
a normal messages cuz that's really

541
00:29:33,039 --> 00:29:34,620
where the controls are

542
00:29:34,620 --> 00:29:38,919
so that's like your lawn lock in your
lock ours if you have a key fob persons

543
00:29:38,919 --> 00:29:41,760
like their locker I'm like that's really
where you can find that

544
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:45,250
to get information is to know messages
you may be able to find it a diagnostic

545
00:29:45,250 --> 00:29:47,000
information but is really rare

546
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:50,380
that some fun things like that
lock/unlock may be there

547
00:29:50,380 --> 00:29:54,520
so you know understanding the
differences between diagnostics in

548
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:57,950
normal communications is really cheat if
you're gonna get out there and have

549
00:29:57,950 --> 00:30:02,320
you know from here so reverse
engineering normal messages

550
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:05,879
again we just gotta look for a pattern
you know anybody who's worked with

551
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:07,460
reverse engineering knows it

552
00:30:07,460 --> 00:30:10,630
1c establish a pattern like you had the
key fob

553
00:30:10,630 --> 00:30:14,870
every time I do it a this message shows
up chances are that's a key but that

554
00:30:14,870 --> 00:30:16,429
sherlach message read

555
00:30:16,429 --> 00:30:20,169
are you open the door on the car he
every time I do that this bit flips

556
00:30:20,169 --> 00:30:24,279
goes from 0 to 10 21 a it's a pattern so
to salvage a pattern

557
00:30:24,279 --> 00:30:27,760
I'm attempt to change the vehicles
import and then use filtering

558
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:31,279
a lot of data there you know it's not
yours look at it

559
00:30:31,279 --> 00:30:33,919
is always did a changing your not
opening the door looking for the door

560
00:30:33,919 --> 00:30:36,570
message got ok for the door you don't
they open the door

561
00:30:36,570 --> 00:30:40,730
it's not there try to filter it out use
whatever methods you can to filter out

562
00:30:40,730 --> 00:30:43,929
all that extra data

563
00:30:43,929 --> 00:30:47,070
a little bit about the diagnostic
protocols already to

564
00:30:47,070 --> 00:30:51,908
are on board diagnostics a little too
I'm is really probably the most common

565
00:30:51,909 --> 00:30:53,830
thing you go to Wikipedia you can look
up

566
00:30:53,830 --> 00:30:56,990
the entire spell a pretty much the
entire spec

567
00:30:56,990 --> 00:31:00,330
I'm especially the messages themselves
so I recommend their

568
00:31:00,330 --> 00:31:03,460
on are many here

569
00:31:03,460 --> 00:31:06,769
millions have their own labor
diagnostics

570
00:31:06,769 --> 00:31:11,529
Islanders Ice a 42-30 also known as you
yes for universal diagnostic system

571
00:31:11,529 --> 00:31:15,130
that's used in for your Ford started
really a doubt that's more european

572
00:31:15,130 --> 00:31:17,409
effort to try to unify diagnostics

573
00:31:17,409 --> 00:31:21,820
arm used used to be I saw a 14 to 29

574
00:31:21,820 --> 00:31:25,090
that's where the old one you know i mix
those two up

575
00:31:25,090 --> 00:31:28,240
UBS access to $42.9 cutest as

576
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:32,000
4230 doesn't make any sense her the
numbers are

577
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:35,399
river Tiber as a forty-two 29 is
exceeded

578
00:31:35,399 --> 00:31:38,840
one that everybody's moving to from 4230

579
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:42,500
and then there's GM lawn on gym when is
made by

580
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:45,980
Jim order our general motors and

581
00:31:45,980 --> 00:31:49,620
its specification you can download for
free an app for free but for like 50

582
00:31:49,620 --> 00:31:51,380
bucks from my HS global

583
00:31:51,380 --> 00:31:56,600
comets GNW 3110 so it's a really really
useful spec

584
00:31:56,600 --> 00:32:01,330
if you want to learn about your give a
GM vehicle on

585
00:32:01,330 --> 00:32:05,710
all these are all it is by 16 a property
too often referred to enhance

586
00:32:05,710 --> 00:32:09,230
as enhanced diagnostics so when you're

587
00:32:09,230 --> 00:32:12,230
you know where you're looking for like I
want enhanced

588
00:32:12,230 --> 00:32:15,320
kids or something like that it's easier
in the enhanced level

589
00:32:15,320 --> 00:32:18,820
it's really everything that outside
everybody to and just to give you idea

590
00:32:18,820 --> 00:32:22,080
why this exists is really only two is
really only their

591
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:26,879
war I am you to understand how the
emissions

592
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:30,169
work on the vehicle its to do emissions
test matter

593
00:32:30,169 --> 00:32:33,289
you know every state has our own at
every single other states have their own

594
00:32:33,289 --> 00:32:34,039
emissions

595
00:32:34,039 --> 00:32:39,110
requirements and if you go on a girl
like a local emissions

596
00:32:39,110 --> 00:32:43,260
you know irony and we'll have a Michigan
so I don't worry about it

597
00:32:43,260 --> 00:32:46,200
if you wanna go to get your missions
check to whatever they'll plug in their

598
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:47,529
own style scan tool

599
00:32:47,529 --> 00:32:52,149
and that's ready to use for and that's
it so if it's if it's outside the realm

600
00:32:52,149 --> 00:32:53,120
other missions

601
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:57,130
it's all on its own hands so it's not
required by nado yams

602
00:32:57,130 --> 00:33:00,309
to enhance so some room wall you know
have

603
00:33:00,309 --> 00:33:04,010
you know this summer their own
parameters there are some have

604
00:33:04,010 --> 00:33:07,950
you know from Wrexham library why annex
it's up to them

605
00:33:07,950 --> 00:33:11,110
what they're gonna support with enhanced
diagnostics we can't really be

606
00:33:11,110 --> 00:33:15,130
I'll became really understand the
differences between the two so

607
00:33:15,130 --> 00:33:20,039
enhanced diagnostics I'm you have to
really get to scan tool that offers

608
00:33:20,039 --> 00:33:23,039
enhanced a massacre in fact one the ones
I use is called

609
00:33:23,039 --> 00:33:26,970
auto ingenuity they make a very good I'm
relatively low-cost

610
00:33:26,970 --> 00:33:30,460
scan tool that offers you a lot of good
enhanced

611
00:33:30,460 --> 00:33:34,970
ability as well on on in

612
00:33:34,970 --> 00:33:38,510
if you're going to learn anything about
diagnostic protocol

613
00:33:38,510 --> 00:33:41,779
I recommend starting with I saw 15 765

614
00:33:41,779 --> 00:33:45,840
I'm specifically I cities as excited as
to you or just going over to campus

615
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:51,450
acecomm and then are reading my blog
entry and I cities and 65 this is really

616
00:33:51,450 --> 00:33:55,110
the décor all diagnostic protocol so
you gonna start

617
00:33:55,110 --> 00:33:58,260
they are interpreting diagnostic
information yourself that's really where

618
00:33:58,260 --> 00:33:59,129
should start

619
00:33:59,130 --> 00:34:02,730
a little bit about 14 to 29 TDs word and

620
00:34:02,730 --> 00:34:06,409
230 there are many overlapping functions
on

621
00:34:06,409 --> 00:34:10,389
the combine to make a buck eighty
percent followed I'm asking you

622
00:34:10,389 --> 00:34:14,050
so if you learn just wander to these
really very similar

623
00:34:14,050 --> 00:34:17,810
documents if you learn just one or two
them

624
00:34:17,810 --> 00:34:22,310
you really be ready to interpret any
scan tool data that get senator now by a

625
00:34:22,310 --> 00:34:23,099
scan tool

626
00:34:23,099 --> 00:34:27,230
on it allows for all your specific
functions and

627
00:34:27,230 --> 00:34:34,230
crane responses and they're also use for
real reading TT seizing control albert's

628
00:34:34,349 --> 00:34:38,320
every last drop some if you could you
make your car

629
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:41,639
goal over slower because

630
00:34:41,639 --> 00:34:44,720
you wanted to send a command out as a a
turn off

631
00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:47,820
you know by joining our own turn off a

632
00:34:47,820 --> 00:34:51,520
you know so under 12 it's pretty fun

633
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:54,250
you know have done it

634
00:34:54,250 --> 00:34:58,170
the so you can do it you know just
that's that's there was a fun things

635
00:34:58,170 --> 00:35:00,240
have you wondered if you drive your
friend

636
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:03,430
your computer next to you and you wanted
to lock the doors

637
00:35:03,430 --> 00:35:07,240
honk the horn our driving you do it
through diagnostics

638
00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:10,300
I'm it's fun honk the horn is

639
00:35:10,300 --> 00:35:13,160
7 a good idea a

640
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:16,370
now occasion be in the back seat

641
00:35:16,370 --> 00:35:21,509
hi Tim GM General Motors diagnostic
protocol Jim W 3110

642
00:35:21,510 --> 00:35:25,460
a started over there the old sabes

643
00:35:25,460 --> 00:35:30,590
9-3 start with him Lancer so really from
2005 and newer GM

644
00:35:30,590 --> 00:35:33,840
move to GM ran it's that it's really it

645
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:37,650
it's really ubiquitous term if you look
at a few research on is what people

646
00:35:37,650 --> 00:35:41,570
don't really have a grasp on what GM
land really is just the specification

647
00:35:41,570 --> 00:35:43,130
for TMW 110

648
00:35:43,130 --> 00:35:47,660
so any car that follows a specification
is a GM land vehicle

649
00:35:47,660 --> 00:35:52,210
I am love people refer to GM land as the
saying Where Can

650
00:35:52,210 --> 00:35:56,780
on the done the vehicle that Sajan when
it's love more encompassing the man

651
00:35:56,780 --> 00:36:01,080
I'm a large you for reading and writing
data just like connie other diagnostics

652
00:36:01,080 --> 00:36:05,640
backs and soul and GM obviously but is
really similar to all the other darkness

653
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:09,220
protocols is a lot of overlap there's
ruined them change too much

654
00:36:09,220 --> 00:36:12,780
I'm nobody to on

655
00:36:12,780 --> 00:36:17,540
died in 1986 a new are also known as as
a DJ 1979

656
00:36:17,540 --> 00:36:20,750
so if you're looking up specifications
CNN's to the nine

657
00:36:20,750 --> 00:36:24,280
they've replacing it 79 with 15 765

658
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:28,380
but you'll see that this saudi and
Syrian is a good spec to realtor

659
00:36:28,380 --> 00:36:32,650
attended promotes on redefined

660
00:36:32,650 --> 00:36:36,330
a again my missions related own me

661
00:36:36,330 --> 00:36:40,529
so of its not emissions related it's
really not going to be there

662
00:36:40,530 --> 00:36:43,810
this is the reason for on mod-01

663
00:36:43,810 --> 00:36:47,180
they often refer to their services or
functions as modes

664
00:36:47,180 --> 00:36:50,210
I am some old one is how you can read

665
00:36:50,210 --> 00:36:53,950
data by parameter ID your hid and this
is probably the

666
00:36:53,950 --> 00:36:57,940
the term that a lot of people working
for these periods primarily use a system

667
00:36:57,940 --> 00:37:01,130
single ID that defines you know engines
the

668
00:37:01,130 --> 00:37:06,180
vehicles the arm bildt and maybe engine
coolant temperature sensor

669
00:37:06,180 --> 00:37:09,899
again you can go to Wikipedia and you
can look up that every single one other

670
00:37:09,900 --> 00:37:14,100
kids what they'd what they do and bla
bla how they are interpreted as there's

671
00:37:14,100 --> 00:37:17,259
the response comes back on

672
00:37:17,260 --> 00:37:20,810
and really represents really a very
small fraction of all the diagnostics

673
00:37:20,810 --> 00:37:22,620
that exist on the vehicle network so

674
00:37:22,620 --> 00:37:25,250
what's a good place to start there
really is this once you get your you

675
00:37:25,250 --> 00:37:28,290
just get your feet wet with nobody to
because there's so many tools

676
00:37:28,290 --> 00:37:32,110
you know for like two hundred dollars
you can go even cheaper you can collect

677
00:37:32,110 --> 00:37:36,770
Autozone or something i buy a scan tool
you know and really simple spaghetti and

678
00:37:36,770 --> 00:37:39,900
it'll send diagnostic information are
you going to put you in your car you can

679
00:37:39,900 --> 00:37:40,980
plug it into your

680
00:37:40,980 --> 00:37:44,350
you know your drina and see what it's
doing

681
00:37:44,350 --> 00:37:48,970
on it'll send out a message in it so you
know how to respond to that message

682
00:37:48,970 --> 00:37:52,440
which pier my with my blog et cetera you
ken

683
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:56,320
you could start to learn how to had a
formulate those responses

684
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:59,490
arm then you don't even need a car
anymore

685
00:37:59,490 --> 00:38:03,400
you know a few you live in New York City
probably don't have a car so

686
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:06,570
you need a car can just you don't just
do on a bench

687
00:38:06,570 --> 00:38:10,030
and Jonathan ok

688
00:38:10,030 --> 00:38:13,490
dynastic comedians I am

689
00:38:13,490 --> 00:38:17,170
canvas so was a turn a sister I'm

690
00:38:17,170 --> 00:38:21,550
with her diagnostics you know we are at
the mercy the control software

691
00:38:21,550 --> 00:38:24,960
this is one thing I people understand is
a while I just wanna know you know

692
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:28,710
as wanna make the trunk open and close
to

693
00:38:28,710 --> 00:38:32,180
you know you don't have it do not have
no clothes strong but you wanted me to

694
00:38:32,180 --> 00:38:33,589
close by sending data

695
00:38:33,590 --> 00:38:38,250
you are at the mercy the software so if
your software can do it if it says no I

696
00:38:38,250 --> 00:38:39,040
can't do it

697
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:42,090
well then you have to change software me

698
00:38:42,090 --> 00:38:45,400
easy you know just modifier that's a
whole different class

699
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:49,230
a but but you know just if you wanted to

700
00:38:49,230 --> 00:38:53,690
if you wanna send data to the car you
absolutely can't you can send it all say

701
00:38:53,690 --> 00:38:57,500
thank you for the data no will not do
them

702
00:38:57,500 --> 00:39:00,750
it will it does it all the time I try
and try and try

703
00:39:00,750 --> 00:39:04,400
but that's kinda funny no check having
it say no and then making it say yes

704
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:05,100
eventually

705
00:39:05,100 --> 00:39:08,440
a you know just trickling in I'm

706
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:11,780
and once you start learning any
combining those normal messages with the

707
00:39:11,780 --> 00:39:14,830
diagnostic information if you can
combine those two

708
00:39:14,830 --> 00:39:18,840
by could I i give you a great example
have a problem where I'm trying to you

709
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:22,100
make the fuel control Marshall turn on
us what's this

710
00:39:22,100 --> 00:39:26,490
three if you look too much on trimming
the few good role model turned on and it

711
00:39:26,490 --> 00:39:27,550
has no after

712
00:39:27,550 --> 00:39:30,570
thirty-seconds no I won't turn a well

713
00:39:30,570 --> 00:39:34,440
I figured out a way using a combination
or messages

714
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:37,980
and diagnostic messages to maybe see yes
it actually I don't have to change the

715
00:39:37,980 --> 00:39:38,650
software

716
00:39:38,650 --> 00:39:42,000
was looking into it I needed to do but
them

717
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:46,350
know there's a weighted to bypass some
others summers off for restrictions

718
00:39:46,350 --> 00:39:49,700
another good example access to problems
two times where

719
00:39:49,700 --> 00:39:53,950
20 amps trying to turn the children
Michael on another one

720
00:39:53,950 --> 00:39:58,320
it said okay no I won't turn off your
charm I join I said well then reset

721
00:39:58,320 --> 00:39:59,030
software

722
00:39:59,030 --> 00:40:04,030
okay now gonna okay no problem so you're
using diagnostic messages to tell it to

723
00:40:04,030 --> 00:40:05,700
reset maybe have to take a different

724
00:40:05,700 --> 00:40:09,560
way around it city also has a lot of
different services

725
00:40:09,560 --> 00:40:12,960
and maybe you're not using them for
their intended for that's the other

726
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:14,240
thing is really important

727
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:17,430
don't use necessarily have to use them
for their intended for

728
00:40:17,430 --> 00:40:20,779
I you know but for your own will which
is kinda

729
00:40:20,780 --> 00:40:24,040
numbers were arm

730
00:40:24,040 --> 00:40:27,920
so I the commands that we use the so you
can do things like

731
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:32,340
you know locking or unlocking the doors
engine idle speed is really common mine

732
00:40:32,340 --> 00:40:36,040
rumored only diagnostics so so

733
00:40:36,040 --> 00:40:39,470
really I think about okay what with it
with the

734
00:40:39,470 --> 00:40:43,970
the diagnostic technician need to do to
solve a problem on this vehicle

735
00:40:43,970 --> 00:40:48,940
well then we could probably do it
ourselves so we can send their arguments

736
00:40:48,940 --> 00:40:54,050
um is always a sequence in order to them
again to be in response sometimes as a

737
00:40:54,050 --> 00:40:55,130
sequence of them

738
00:40:55,130 --> 00:40:58,290
you know you have to set it up say okay
I want to start agnostics now

739
00:40:58,290 --> 00:41:02,170
now I'll now that I've started a mass
text I wanna do this area

740
00:41:02,170 --> 00:41:06,210
on and that's better

741
00:41:06,210 --> 00:41:10,650
okay and the normal messages the third
again we're going back to

742
00:41:10,650 --> 00:41:15,100
this is the kum these are the messages
between them between two controllers

743
00:41:15,100 --> 00:41:19,670
on so is typically a little bit harder
to find his commands

744
00:41:19,670 --> 00:41:24,390
as you can imagine there's no format you
can just tell us can to let a

745
00:41:24,390 --> 00:41:27,980
send this command get a look for you
have to actually be a press the key fob

746
00:41:27,980 --> 00:41:30,070
open the door open to trying ca

747
00:41:30,070 --> 00:41:33,220
you know drive the car down the road if
you need to find

748
00:41:33,220 --> 00:41:36,890
the XP or something like that these
things it is day to this is normally

749
00:41:36,890 --> 00:41:38,040
going out there

750
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:41,540
and and with the prom with can-bus is

751
00:41:41,540 --> 00:41:44,990
you know if your have a controller that
sending that message but you wanna send

752
00:41:44,990 --> 00:41:45,960
it instead

753
00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:48,870
well i controllers not going to stop
sending that message has cuz you want

754
00:41:48,870 --> 00:41:49,540
senator

755
00:41:49,540 --> 00:41:53,890
so you have to find a way I really
creative intuitive ways later

756
00:41:53,890 --> 00:41:58,009
to make that message disappears best as
possible or to send

757
00:41:58,010 --> 00:42:01,860
your message immediately after it so
that you can send your own version it so

758
00:42:01,860 --> 00:42:02,850
these are things but

759
00:42:02,850 --> 00:42:05,359
then of course there's always
consequences to you send in your own

760
00:42:05,359 --> 00:42:06,460
version of it

761
00:42:06,460 --> 00:42:10,790
obviously so you have to be aware that
if you're driving down the road

762
00:42:10,790 --> 00:42:14,430
and you turn off you know later

763
00:42:14,430 --> 00:42:17,490
traction control or something like that

764
00:42:17,490 --> 00:42:20,550
you know that's gone it's gone for a
while in you have to have yet to learn

765
00:42:20,550 --> 00:42:22,510
how to dance and I guess the commands

766
00:42:22,510 --> 00:42:26,380
to cleared any information that you may
have cost like I still have that airbag

767
00:42:26,380 --> 00:42:28,650
light on my car I gotta get better there

768
00:42:28,650 --> 00:42:33,520
so you not have health I don't know
where day's work will find a

769
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:36,740
up so kid you know

770
00:42:36,740 --> 00:42:40,490
so you have to be you know be aware that
with you know when you're working with

771
00:42:40,490 --> 00:42:43,540
with these messages you still have all
these physical layer constraints they

772
00:42:43,540 --> 00:42:44,720
have to deal with

773
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:48,160
you know the canvas messages going out
from the other controllers if you need

774
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:49,620
to send your virginity

775
00:42:49,620 --> 00:42:53,170
it to find a way to shut up now you
could physically poll

776
00:42:53,170 --> 00:42:56,780
module obviously that's not a good idea
in like cases specially integral

777
00:42:56,780 --> 00:43:00,310
just won't drive but you could pull like
fuses or

778
00:43:00,310 --> 00:43:03,529
there are other diagnostic commands to
make it work but you know it's you

779
00:43:03,530 --> 00:43:05,130
really have to get in there and you know

780
00:43:05,130 --> 00:43:09,230
put because these little bit figure out
how to other disable some real a normal

781
00:43:09,230 --> 00:43:10,120
communications

782
00:43:10,120 --> 00:43:13,529
buttons in cases some communications
then we have been one-time

783
00:43:13,530 --> 00:43:18,609
their events you know their mock
commands or something like that

784
00:43:18,609 --> 00:43:22,390
you can send your version unlocked
emitted the current box

785
00:43:22,390 --> 00:43:25,810
greater works and lock in a car lock so
it's pretty fun

786
00:43:25,810 --> 00:43:28,970
on uttered

787
00:43:28,970 --> 00:43:32,750
tomb see security systems

788
00:43:32,750 --> 00:43:35,760
so a lot of people were if they're gonna
get into the car they're gonna

789
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:39,650
wanna know a little bit more about the
security in them so

790
00:43:39,650 --> 00:43:44,310
so the OEM's worse Martin is said hey
listen what if somebody else wanted to

791
00:43:44,310 --> 00:43:45,830
like change the firmware

792
00:43:45,830 --> 00:43:49,140
on this would that be a bad thing or
good things that's a bad thing so let's

793
00:43:49,140 --> 00:43:49,509
sit

794
00:43:49,510 --> 00:43:53,480
that secure or somebody else wanted
changes primers here that parameter

795
00:43:53,480 --> 00:43:54,600
there

796
00:43:54,600 --> 00:43:58,990
put a new key you know like a I got the
ski but I and then learn a new key to my

797
00:43:58,990 --> 00:43:59,790
car

798
00:43:59,790 --> 00:44:02,910
so I answered like we should probably
protect that

799
00:44:02,910 --> 00:44:05,420
information a little better make a
little bit harder for them so they don't

800
00:44:05,420 --> 00:44:07,170
work almost every actually

801
00:44:07,170 --> 00:44:11,570
every every Windows this the they
secured using something on the 27 yr

802
00:44:11,570 --> 00:44:13,359
service 27

803
00:44:13,359 --> 00:44:16,799
on and how it works is your request a
seed

804
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:21,290
from the cars eighty gimme a seed
problem happen here

805
00:44:21,290 --> 00:44:25,259
could be matures soon like

806
00:44:25,260 --> 00:44:30,520
it is so bill hey gimme a seed 02 2701

807
00:44:30,520 --> 00:44:34,000
that's it commute see dennis is OK user
seed

808
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:39,740
6701 1983 that's that 1983 sweet angels
1983

809
00:44:39,740 --> 00:44:43,200
we apply it to some algorithm and I know
you know it's a standard

810
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:46,380
hash algorithm of some sort and then

811
00:44:46,380 --> 00:44:50,010
later down actually thats

812
00:44:50,010 --> 00:44:55,780
one your tweezer ok

813
00:44:55,780 --> 00:44:59,780
times okay there's a response so says
okay here's your

814
00:44:59,780 --> 00:45:03,130
here's a key so i SAT 85cm forever

815
00:45:03,130 --> 00:45:06,160
so your standard you know hey there's a

816
00:45:06,160 --> 00:45:10,220
here's their haz response let's see on

817
00:45:10,220 --> 00:45:14,520
now it is OK I agree we both carotid the
same value so

818
00:45:14,520 --> 00:45:18,240
is now unlocked good news is its
unlocked now I A

819
00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:21,640
don't have to know the algorithm some
other two on the algorithm

820
00:45:21,640 --> 00:45:25,089
now it open I can do whatever one now
right

821
00:45:25,090 --> 00:45:29,650
it open I can changes grammer's added
let me change before I can

822
00:45:29,650 --> 00:45:33,130
reflash much pack that's what I'm doing
right now reynosa whole reflux and

823
00:45:33,130 --> 00:45:35,220
letting another tool to do it but it

824
00:45:35,220 --> 00:45:39,010
took it and actually unlock the
controller for me what's really

825
00:45:39,010 --> 00:45:40,920
interesting is GM

826
00:45:40,920 --> 00:45:44,680
they don't have a very dynamic a cdkey
so

827
00:45:44,680 --> 00:45:48,129
they'd only ever sends the single seat
so I know now

828
00:45:48,130 --> 00:45:53,350
on a marquis comer 85 85cm I'm not gonna
tell you which cars my number but

829
00:45:53,350 --> 00:45:57,310
it's there and you can now unlock this
controller and

830
00:45:57,310 --> 00:46:00,960
now looking I really do I mean I can
reflash

831
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:04,500
I can to lead the firmware for sure
release you know

832
00:46:04,500 --> 00:46:08,550
it will you know you can it doesn't
break commercial issues you do voters

833
00:46:08,550 --> 00:46:10,610
are really good you can still
communicate with their

834
00:46:10,610 --> 00:46:14,490
but on you know it's really starting to
wake up in your engine controller

835
00:46:14,490 --> 00:46:15,720
doesn't have sovereign

836
00:46:15,720 --> 00:46:19,640
so it's possible it's possible you know
you never know

837
00:46:19,640 --> 00:46:23,759
so you can unlock these controllers
either another controller can do that or

838
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:27,830
you can so I you know you can crack you
know if you crack it

839
00:46:27,830 --> 00:46:31,350
he could be profitable I've heard of
people paying good money for that

840
00:46:31,350 --> 00:46:35,330
so you know the security systems are
pretty basic you know you're my kid

841
00:46:35,330 --> 00:46:38,549
and sometimes is a dual security system
I've definitely seen that before you

842
00:46:38,550 --> 00:46:40,840
know you are a year on odometer to the
car

843
00:46:40,840 --> 00:46:44,420
don't know why anyone do that to
increase your miles nigga you didn't get

844
00:46:44,420 --> 00:46:45,210
my agenda

845
00:46:45,210 --> 00:46:51,170
so I am so let's say you want to change
or dahmer a lot of them will have this

846
00:46:51,170 --> 00:46:52,180
standard

847
00:46:52,180 --> 00:46:55,629
security really simple and I have a
second layer security that

848
00:46:55,630 --> 00:46:58,730
in order to rewrite the road honor
because that's a very valid

849
00:46:58,730 --> 00:47:02,260
application rewriting the odometer
because if you're odometers replaced

850
00:47:02,260 --> 00:47:06,140
you know you need to write the new value
to it so

851
00:47:06,140 --> 00:47:09,990
they could be you know could be very
useful %um

852
00:47:09,990 --> 00:47:14,540
so a and that exceed agree to secure a
so I

853
00:47:14,540 --> 00:47:17,360
we have about 10 minutes so I have time
for Kenny there's they said there's

854
00:47:17,360 --> 00:47:20,140
Mikes up there so if anyone has any
questions

855
00:47:20,140 --> 00:47:24,460
internal ate up a little bit think peace
time to do it and we have space is going

856
00:47:24,460 --> 00:47:25,640
ok

857
00:47:25,640 --> 00:47:32,640
think when there's a company called ross
tack in a minute a

858
00:47:35,270 --> 00:47:38,710
vag-com is the sovereignty USB down one
dollar

859
00:47:38,710 --> 00:47:42,090
and I was like about a hundred dollars
getting internet

860
00:47:42,090 --> 00:47:45,450
minute are they like an anomaly or do
other people have that kind of

861
00:47:45,450 --> 00:47:48,000
fanaticism support for different makes
models

862
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:52,030
um I've actually never use the vag-com
thing but I

863
00:47:52,030 --> 00:47:55,590
I think like I said I do ingenuity has a
tool but that is cheap

864
00:47:55,590 --> 00:47:58,760
I am I don't know who has other

865
00:47:58,760 --> 00:48:02,050
there's like ALM tools you can buy
things like that

866
00:48:02,050 --> 00:48:05,060
a I don't really know yes I think there
is a

867
00:48:05,060 --> 00:48:08,620
add her to bed but I I don't know but
that's just for this I tell you now

868
00:48:08,620 --> 00:48:13,620
yeah every odd vector

869
00:48:13,620 --> 00:48:18,450
bags through would ask you what does the
arbitration on the bus how does how does

870
00:48:18,450 --> 00:48:18,700
he

871
00:48:18,690 --> 00:48:22,450
all know arbitrary and I'm ready to talk
give yeah

872
00:48:22,450 --> 00:48:25,530
okay so let's use my hands

873
00:48:25,530 --> 00:48:29,990
okay we have to wear two controllers say
this is a typical everybody who works

874
00:48:29,990 --> 00:48:31,260
were sealed their networks

875
00:48:31,260 --> 00:48:34,980
understands what about this but the two
controllers the ball the bus is free any

876
00:48:34,980 --> 00:48:36,910
both controllers could talk at the same
time

877
00:48:36,910 --> 00:48:40,589
the posts are talking clearly occlusions
gonna happen

878
00:48:40,590 --> 00:48:44,000
in the case the Internet it detects the
collision starts resets rate everybody

879
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:44,570
know that but

880
00:48:44,570 --> 00:48:48,410
with even with can-bus only wearable

881
00:48:48,410 --> 00:48:53,359
or normal stop so we'll both both nodes
will start sending

882
00:48:53,360 --> 00:48:56,370
a starter frame ago

883
00:48:56,370 --> 00:48:59,690
and then a server their application ID
Iranian to deter

884
00:48:59,690 --> 00:49:03,220
and then but one of them will say it
will go higher with an arbitration

885
00:49:03,220 --> 00:49:04,520
eighty and one below

886
00:49:04,520 --> 00:49:08,030
well Loewen straight because it sets a
lower number

887
00:49:08,030 --> 00:49:12,900
essentially that's how it works solo
wins and

888
00:49:12,900 --> 00:49:16,360
as your strength vinyasa listed at the
same time

889
00:49:16,360 --> 00:49:19,840
see you realize he the bus went low but
I didn't want to go

890
00:49:19,840 --> 00:49:24,100
that angered that means I'm being
arbitrated out there is somebody else is

891
00:49:24,100 --> 00:49:24,850
sending

892
00:49:24,850 --> 00:49:28,890
a an arbitration frame at the same time
I was the whole time we've been

893
00:49:28,890 --> 00:49:33,299
in sync with each other and how to sync
I'm listening now I go to receive your

894
00:49:33,300 --> 00:49:36,590
ice I back off and then that the
transmitter

895
00:49:36,590 --> 00:49:40,260
whose children have no idea that I was
everyone talking on the bus because as

896
00:49:40,260 --> 00:49:41,560
far as he's concerned that wave

897
00:49:41,560 --> 00:49:44,690
you look at the wave and the bus you
would never know so that

898
00:49:44,690 --> 00:49:47,800
that it says are gamma I'm arbitrated
our

899
00:49:47,800 --> 00:49:51,310
move on to the next one in the idea is
the ideal modular

900
00:49:51,310 --> 00:49:54,799
the idea is really just a concept rate
the ID really means

901
00:49:54,800 --> 00:49:57,830
alright this is the data thats is stored
here

902
00:49:57,830 --> 00:50:00,940
in Amin this is ID 111 means

903
00:50:00,940 --> 00:50:04,030
every time when 11 comes out I have this
data

904
00:50:04,030 --> 00:50:07,600
in this frame in this former its rulers
for it doesn't really

905
00:50:07,600 --> 00:50:12,490
necessarily mean something in a case
diagnostics $70,000 et cetera

906
00:50:12,490 --> 00:50:15,800
but doesn't really mean anything in the
case enormous messages

907
00:50:15,800 --> 00:50:19,790
themselves thanks better under

908
00:50:19,790 --> 00:50:23,360
a mess around with the sleep words after
the forwarder

909
00:50:23,360 --> 00:50:26,450
ideas IDSs home given archive can't

910
00:50:26,450 --> 00:50:30,750
really as a duet Chinese one gated it
cheaper to build a monster had to get up

911
00:50:30,750 --> 00:50:31,740
and fix a few things

912
00:50:31,740 --> 00:50:35,330
I you know you pay for that's fine and
yes exactly

913
00:50:35,330 --> 00:50:39,029
um no 0 the softer though that comes
with it seems to be

914
00:50:39,030 --> 00:50:42,450
it's a it so bad I don't mind

915
00:50:42,450 --> 00:50:45,450
it was any Israeli thing else to go on
with the

916
00:50:45,450 --> 00:50:48,870
hasn't been I like but I'd only one I
don't represent the company in our by

917
00:50:48,870 --> 00:50:49,790
Rep Ritter

918
00:50:49,790 --> 00:50:53,140
recommend the auto engineering towards
really different and stuff like just

919
00:50:53,140 --> 00:50:55,319
enhance bids just hence can't control

920
00:50:55,320 --> 00:50:58,350
live very good we want to do something
that's not it like

921
00:50:58,350 --> 00:51:02,740
only four technicians should be able you
the idea is to really only gone fortune

922
00:51:02,740 --> 00:51:06,590
from happens like the next layer neither
I haven't been willing to put in my card

923
00:51:06,590 --> 00:51:09,940
scares me just think it crashes does
once a month things i was looking at

924
00:51:09,940 --> 00:51:11,190
this is it will be fine

925
00:51:11,190 --> 00:51:14,230
he'll be fine Miller plug it in a lower
longer needed

926
00:51:14,230 --> 00:51:19,770
chances are hurting a little nah that's
why I got the republican member

927
00:51:19,770 --> 00:51:23,130
electronic warranty in the you know I'm
here talking about this on top dog

928
00:51:23,130 --> 00:51:27,800
yeah I don't know a Hallowe'en I don't
like in their it wasn't an Akai Hana

929
00:51:27,800 --> 00:51:32,070
that technicians a my house all major

930
00:51:32,070 --> 00:51:34,890
no but like the others a lot lead
systems this thing was like you know

931
00:51:34,890 --> 00:51:36,670
collision avoidance lot supposed okay

932
00:51:36,670 --> 00:51:41,050
begin you're weird like is the stuff
documented anywhere look at those

933
00:51:41,050 --> 00:51:44,410
midgets super close but which protocol
the using in can I communicate

934
00:51:44,410 --> 00:51:47,740
closer to the IDS if you wanna

935
00:51:47,740 --> 00:51:51,330
like simulate a car you need to learn 14
to 29

936
00:51:51,330 --> 00:51:55,240
women or 14 to 30 band which car you
have company borden transition away from

937
00:51:55,240 --> 00:51:56,240
fourteen to do

938
00:51:56,240 --> 00:52:00,260
230 arm but if I if I look at the the
idea software

939
00:52:00,260 --> 00:52:03,550
they will be speaking this internally
cracked in an intern on

940
00:52:03,550 --> 00:52:06,980
it'll talk to it to the controller today

941
00:52:06,980 --> 00:52:11,080
I don't know how much is handle on the
hardware itself versus the software

942
00:52:11,080 --> 00:52:14,120
got two guys I don't know that the
interaction is is no what's output from

943
00:52:14,120 --> 00:52:14,430
the

944
00:52:14,430 --> 00:52:17,850
from controller in its thats him ok
assistance was

945
00:52:17,850 --> 00:52:21,250
Switzerland on things wasn't yeah it's
like three points got a point but no one

946
00:52:21,250 --> 00:52:22,020
knows yet

947
00:52:22,020 --> 00:52:25,660
may I dunno yeah because I don't know
business a minute if no one knows I'll

948
00:52:25,660 --> 00:52:31,690
take a look and yes it could look like
yeah that better

949
00:52:31,690 --> 00:52:35,090
have have you messed around with
motorcycles at all II I used to work

950
00:52:35,090 --> 00:52:38,300
with our little bits but they just were
starting in a CAN bus

951
00:52:38,300 --> 00:52:41,710
at the time so I am both to Kody

952
00:52:41,710 --> 00:52:45,430
and BMW use you some more stuff and get
actually

953
00:52:45,430 --> 00:52:49,180
some guy did a thesis on his pieces for
school

954
00:52:49,180 --> 00:52:52,870
on a reverse engineering the whole to
cart he thinks her you buy so I'm to

955
00:52:52,870 --> 00:52:53,819
cutting board

956
00:52:53,820 --> 00:52:57,090
yeah they're talking about that I never
really read above it all to cutting diet

957
00:52:57,090 --> 00:52:59,730
diet it's really interesting if you can
do

958
00:52:59,730 --> 00:53:03,660
all kinds of stuff like do that we do
the fuel maps n yes for sale that's a

959
00:53:03,660 --> 00:53:05,190
huge business

960
00:53:05,190 --> 00:53:08,730
you know redo a few metzger debut the
tuner knows about re doing but it's

961
00:53:08,730 --> 00:53:09,820
really not

962
00:53:09,820 --> 00:53:14,140
that's that's really high-level
application ovett I had two minutes ago

963
00:53:14,140 --> 00:53:17,490
I'll thanks never to carry

964
00:53:17,490 --> 00:53:21,420
yet again Jim know with the

965
00:53:21,420 --> 00:53:25,890
transition towards a I'll EPS sir
electric power steering is that the only

966
00:53:25,890 --> 00:53:26,960
put on

967
00:53:26,960 --> 00:53:30,040
these buses the room no no no no no no

968
00:53:30,040 --> 00:53:34,130
so you won't be a lunar but you'll be
able to happen unless obviously but done

969
00:53:34,130 --> 00:53:37,260
though they were put on the buses but
the controllers are there so this offer

970
00:53:37,260 --> 00:53:38,200
is there

971
00:53:38,200 --> 00:53:41,870
right um what there are two private
canvases

972
00:53:41,870 --> 00:53:46,040
as well between two controllers like a
lot of good ABS controllers and two

973
00:53:46,040 --> 00:53:46,710
controllers

974
00:53:46,710 --> 00:53:49,840
by their own private can network had to
tap into those

975
00:53:49,840 --> 00:53:52,900
so they have some physical security
after augment

976
00:53:52,900 --> 00:53:56,550
which is good actually that thats reply
gap is good however

977
00:53:56,550 --> 00:54:00,220
the controllers they're still
controllers that are on the CAN bus so

978
00:54:00,220 --> 00:54:04,010
if we find a way to modify software
clearly we can reflash it

979
00:54:04,010 --> 00:54:07,220
over can-bus me we have a potential

980
00:54:07,220 --> 00:54:10,970
arm for you notes during into knows
schoolchildren

981
00:54:10,970 --> 00:54:14,460
Jeter I mean it's bad don't do that kids

982
00:54:14,460 --> 00:54:17,880
so so don't know that didn't but
fortunately there's

983
00:54:17,880 --> 00:54:20,970
little bit smart and they think will
will set it aside

984
00:54:20,970 --> 00:54:24,210
and they won't do it and that's good on
but the software although they're

985
00:54:24,210 --> 00:54:25,760
getting better risking software

986
00:54:25,760 --> 00:54:30,570
God that's good ThinkCentre

987
00:54:30,570 --> 00:54:33,830
you recommend any particular can stock

988
00:54:33,830 --> 00:54:40,520
on how like as far as the can stacks for
diagnostics or can stacks for just

989
00:54:40,520 --> 00:54:41,870
general like

990
00:54:41,870 --> 00:54:45,290
I'd like I'm gonna make my own
controller wanna throw canseco grandma

991
00:54:45,290 --> 00:54:46,870
to try and let your mind cancel

992
00:54:46,870 --> 00:54:50,460
yeah it did some more many years ago
when Pan Bus

993
00:54:50,460 --> 00:54:54,670
can stack Medina why I mean it had used
a handful love them

994
00:54:54,670 --> 00:54:57,750
only you by proxy release you some
electric the guys

995
00:54:57,750 --> 00:55:01,090
and so I can really recommend anybody
good they're just really expensive

996
00:55:01,090 --> 00:55:02,290
that's all I know

997
00:55:02,290 --> 00:55:05,400
they are yeah 102 here

998
00:55:05,400 --> 00:55:08,700
than to everyone you can stick I don't
know how much time I have a make good

999
00:55:08,700 --> 00:55:11,860
I don't I can see the signs so 70 K

1000
00:55:11,860 --> 00:55:17,620
leveling I think that when I can

1001
00:55:17,620 --> 00:55:19,640
and came back well
