1
00:00:04,009 --> 00:00:06,930
no this time it's just

2
00:00:06,930 --> 00:00:12,290
introducing which is so nice

3
00:00:12,290 --> 00:00:15,990
actually for the first time pretty much
presenting career

4
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:19,529
step boom

5
00:00:19,529 --> 00:00:26,529
walk away 18 cases where the crap

6
00:01:24,710 --> 00:01:27,500
just by show of hands while we're
waiting to sit down everything how many

7
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:32,740
people have been to the lockpicking area
the there's a you are some you are lying

8
00:01:32,740 --> 00:01:33,600
is not that much

9
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:37,620
how many people just always talk

10
00:01:37,620 --> 00:01:44,620
any bill that was awesome days a hard
act to follow

11
00:01:46,070 --> 00:01:50,190
but will try alright

12
00:01:50,190 --> 00:01:53,550
a quick intro logic so you have I do
have one

13
00:01:53,550 --> 00:01:56,980
interesting and somewhat relevant Nelson
a large covers are related to

14
00:01:56,980 --> 00:02:00,570
tool or any the phone trying lockpick
village but there's something called the

15
00:02:00,570 --> 00:02:01,880
College of lockpicking

16
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:06,740
this is not a joke button articles
lockpicking is fundraising

17
00:02:06,740 --> 00:02:10,780
for hackers basis for every 10 piece
custom lock pick set you buy for 30

18
00:02:10,780 --> 00:02:11,460
bucks

19
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:14,830
block pit called like that he will
donate 10%

20
00:02:14,830 --> 00:02:18,980
to the hackerspace love your choice see
can visit the college

21
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:22,940
lockpicking there on the second floor
and mezzanine area

22
00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:26,060
up the event space so on

23
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:30,420
thanks for hangin with us we're havin a
think I think a very successful day and

24
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:31,760
we're gonna have a very successful

25
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:36,299
evening and into the morning and just I
don't plan on sleeping a lot

26
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:39,900
next three days up next is darn

27
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:43,720
all about mastering we can talk about
mastering

28
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:46,980
the master key system by the master of

29
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:53,980
the master keys deviant so thank you

30
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:06,120
thank you very much this talk was
originally going to be bother can I

31
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:09,950
bolick is still as far as I know waiting
for a flight that's about to take off

32
00:03:09,950 --> 00:03:11,130
from Las Vegas

33
00:03:11,130 --> 00:03:15,390
where he is at the lower show so just
because we had ourselves in love you

34
00:03:15,390 --> 00:03:16,060
guys

35
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:20,860
he is at a lower I was here coming off a
shock on his flying back from Vegas to

36
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:22,230
be here for two nights

37
00:03:22,230 --> 00:03:26,040
then we both got a lock on the
international congresses lockpicking

38
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:29,530
held this year in Kentucky then he
kissed a girl right back to Vegas where

39
00:03:29,530 --> 00:03:30,170
he was

40
00:03:30,170 --> 00:03:34,530
as you can never get enough %uh 114
degrees feet on the ground training

41
00:03:34,530 --> 00:03:37,810
black cat run things a deaf Khan and
then come home and then cuz I hate

42
00:03:37,810 --> 00:03:41,680
myself I'm going to torque and and
everything else that I can think up

43
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:42,239
until then

44
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:46,140
how many people get to other conferences
around the world around the country

45
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:49,549
excellent support other con- support
your hackerspace is

46
00:03:49,549 --> 00:03:54,370
support your maker spaces support anyone
who wants to learn fun stuff

47
00:03:54,370 --> 00:03:58,329
and we love it love it love it when
people come by lockpicking area

48
00:03:58,329 --> 00:04:01,530
we love that in the lockpick village
most people get it that

49
00:04:01,530 --> 00:04:06,350
locks are not these magical black boxes
that you're not supposed to look inside

50
00:04:06,350 --> 00:04:10,150
we we think that you should look in and
play with all them and see how they work

51
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:13,959
understand what your locks are doing
understand what they're capable of

52
00:04:13,959 --> 00:04:17,649
understand what you're capable of and
we're gonna talk a lot about that right

53
00:04:17,649 --> 00:04:18,010
now

54
00:04:18,010 --> 00:04:22,060
so yes I'm up here because I'm dressed
in a black t-shirt

55
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:25,770
you know that I'm with tool if you see
me in nicer clothes I'm usually with my

56
00:04:25,770 --> 00:04:26,580
company

57
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:29,690
but all in the same the conscious we do
the same thing we

58
00:04:29,690 --> 00:04:33,350
we break into stuff one because we think
it's fine if I'm a tool

59
00:04:33,350 --> 00:04:36,639
and even with my coworker company I'm
getting paid to break into stuff

60
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:39,950
so if you've never considered a career
physical pen testing a

61
00:04:39,950 --> 00:04:44,080
I could tell you it's a hoot running
down stairwells were like securities

62
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:46,919
come in after you got a backpack full
financial records is

63
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:51,340
and you're totally never going to jail
for its is pretty choice

64
00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:55,389
I'll let you know so tall

65
00:04:55,389 --> 00:04:59,340
where we don't get paid is actually we
honestly have even more fun to lose the

66
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:01,210
open organization a block pickers

67
00:05:01,210 --> 00:05:05,370
and all we do is go around teaching
people about this because we think locks

68
00:05:05,370 --> 00:05:08,060
are beautiful little puzzles that should
be dissected

69
00:05:08,060 --> 00:05:12,460
understood tool was found in Holland
tool is now here in the US

70
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:16,180
and as long as you follow the two golden
rules a lockpicking or lock

71
00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:19,480
opening will say you usually find
legally

72
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:23,250
we're not lawyers I ask Alex or pay him
Alex months to somebody else and

73
00:05:23,250 --> 00:05:26,960
they'll tell you the law but ultimately
if you do not pick locks that you don't

74
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:27,659
own

75
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:31,130
and if you do not try to open locks on
which you rely regularly

76
00:05:31,130 --> 00:05:36,280
you should always avoid hassle and we
can get into more about what we mean

77
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:38,070
there and we always top of every

78
00:05:38,070 --> 00:05:41,680
lesson in a lockpick village with these
rules but ultimately not have this

79
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:43,130
knowledge is illegal

80
00:05:43,130 --> 00:05:46,310
unless you do illegal things with it

81
00:05:46,310 --> 00:05:49,800
so really quickly just in case you
haven't been downstairs where we show

82
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:52,050
you that all these different mechanisms

83
00:05:52,050 --> 00:05:55,160
are really one in the same I want to
give a quick hit

84
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:59,140
on how locks function just to make sure
all start on the same page

85
00:05:59,140 --> 00:06:03,169
then we'll go through the real me which
is master key systems

86
00:06:03,170 --> 00:06:07,680
most have you do know I think that locks
involved Hinz somewhere in the most

87
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:09,560
locks involved hands right

88
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:13,620
so internally this is a pin tumbler lock

89
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:17,910
from the outside you can only see a
little piece of 1 pin here this is this

90
00:06:17,910 --> 00:06:20,440
reddish pan we would call that the
keepin'

91
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:24,850
inside you see it's the keepin' and the
driver pin here

92
00:06:24,850 --> 00:06:28,080
topped off by a spring making this pin
stack

93
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:32,159
now at rest this lock cannot be turned
you have no key in it

94
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:35,580
because that driver pin is binding is in
the way

95
00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:39,289
every time you use a lock every time you
operated with the key

96
00:06:39,290 --> 00:06:42,950
he goes in that lifts the pin stack just
enough

97
00:06:42,950 --> 00:06:47,409
so that the shear line between those two
pens is at the edges the plug

98
00:06:47,410 --> 00:06:51,510
everything is free to turn because
there's nothing obstructing make sense

99
00:06:51,510 --> 00:06:56,610
very good this is from the side same
song different versus just a number of

100
00:06:56,610 --> 00:06:57,750
pins tacks

101
00:06:57,750 --> 00:07:01,080
reaching back into the lock and they're
all the same construction it's just

102
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:03,530
different heights on those red keep ends

103
00:07:03,530 --> 00:07:06,580
every time you use your key the cuts on
your key

104
00:07:06,580 --> 00:07:10,520
it's called the beating up the key has
to have the exact right combination of

105
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:14,320
up down up down matching all the heights
and there you walk

106
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:17,980
make sense again everybody not nice and
clear diagrams

107
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:21,190
yes using lock picks

108
00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:24,200
if you come down to the village you will
learn that it's possible to get those

109
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:26,980
pins into the right position to get all
the pins

110
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:30,310
right at the edge of the plug without a
key

111
00:07:30,310 --> 00:07:33,940
we're happy to show you how to do that
involves basically just stressing the

112
00:07:33,940 --> 00:07:35,380
system slightly as with

113
00:07:35,380 --> 00:07:38,630
a lot of packing your a twisting bang on
and see what falls out

114
00:07:38,630 --> 00:07:41,980
you know you stress the system in just
the right way you cause some forces some

115
00:07:41,980 --> 00:07:43,510
tension and some binding

116
00:07:43,510 --> 00:07:47,890
and you reach around you can manipulate
pins with Sir the hunting seeking

117
00:07:47,890 --> 00:07:51,070
action please come on down if you've
never tried it

118
00:07:51,070 --> 00:07:55,550
once again let's see those hands used on
some lockpicking is it easy

119
00:07:55,550 --> 00:07:59,020
yes who is never open the lock with pics
before

120
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:02,539
beautiful I'll all those people
downstairs I want you downstairs after

121
00:08:02,540 --> 00:08:05,230
Raiders is handcuffed demo we're gonna
stick around

122
00:08:05,230 --> 00:08:08,990
or around all weekend we love for you to
come by really appreciate whenever you

123
00:08:08,990 --> 00:08:10,010
come by learn

124
00:08:10,010 --> 00:08:14,640
and it's just as easy as pop pop pop pop
pop now let's say you don't have pics

125
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:18,830
or let's say you're in a situation where
you're attacking a more complicated lock

126
00:08:18,830 --> 00:08:21,419
something not quite so simple

127
00:08:21,420 --> 00:08:24,690
let's say you're in a large institution
type building

128
00:08:24,690 --> 00:08:30,540
big offices often will not want to have
a billion different keys for every door

129
00:08:30,540 --> 00:08:35,229
big institutions education colleges lot
a college campuses in dorms

130
00:08:35,229 --> 00:08:38,649
all these are master key systems many
view

131
00:08:38,649 --> 00:08:41,390
are probably familiar with this term yes
where there's different levels a

132
00:08:41,390 --> 00:08:42,309
permission

133
00:08:42,310 --> 00:08:46,470
some keys will only open one door other
keys will open a whole series of doors

134
00:08:46,470 --> 00:08:47,560
et cetera

135
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:50,510
which is you know I realize it's not a
very applicable talk you don't have like

136
00:08:50,510 --> 00:08:52,420
a lot a big buildings in the city

137
00:08:52,420 --> 00:08:58,250
but there are probably a couple I'm
gonna guess that our master key

138
00:08:58,250 --> 00:09:01,990
how does it work in a nutshell this is
it

139
00:09:01,990 --> 00:09:05,740
Solis additional pins in some

140
00:09:05,740 --> 00:09:09,180
or all usually just some up the pen
stacks

141
00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:13,890
so we have our red keep ends that we saw
before blue pens are all just drivers we

142
00:09:13,890 --> 00:09:14,769
saw them

143
00:09:14,769 --> 00:09:18,350
but a couple these pins tacks you'll see
they have small pins in the middle there

144
00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:20,149
was little teal colored ones

145
00:09:20,149 --> 00:09:23,920
those would just be called master pins
occasionally

146
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:26,750
locksmiths who were in the trade for
many years you hear them call those

147
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:27,829
master wafers

148
00:09:27,829 --> 00:09:31,750
because they're so thin their West
Houston but

149
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:35,339
I've got how how many cons can you go to
where people getting all Python

150
00:09:35,339 --> 00:09:36,230
reference really

151
00:09:36,230 --> 00:09:41,060
come on that's awesome I just like
saying master wafers

152
00:09:41,060 --> 00:09:44,120
basically because if anybody has done
lot a lot picking you know there's a

153
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:46,600
whole other kind a block away for a walk

154
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:49,950
also found in Bing office buildings on
file cabinets and like

155
00:09:49,950 --> 00:09:54,310
but instead of modeling those terms you
always hear me say keepin' driver can

156
00:09:54,310 --> 00:09:59,259
master plan and the introduction master
pins in somebody's chambers

157
00:09:59,259 --> 00:10:03,939
causes the potential for multiple sure
lines just a different heights

158
00:10:03,939 --> 00:10:07,410
see here you see it's possible to line
everything up a share line yes

159
00:10:07,410 --> 00:10:11,040
but if you have an eight cut on what
have your keys because all those bidding

160
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:12,009
cuts

161
00:10:12,009 --> 00:10:15,269
there specifically new numbered every
manufacturer

162
00:10:15,269 --> 00:10:19,810
has your starting at like 0 would be a
blankie they have a one two three four

163
00:10:19,810 --> 00:10:23,860
they have depts and you can lookup depth
charts and keying charts

164
00:10:23,860 --> 00:10:27,100
most manufacturers do not ever exceed 9

165
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:30,249
a lot of them don't even know that far
quickset the most common locked around

166
00:10:30,249 --> 00:10:31,220
anywheres

167
00:10:31,220 --> 00:10:34,999
most goes to six actually was 27 master
key environments but

168
00:10:34,999 --> 00:10:38,660
that's not come but if you have an eight
cut on what are your keys are in my

169
00:10:38,660 --> 00:10:40,089
second cousin a cut

170
00:10:40,089 --> 00:10:44,529
we don't really know if that eight cut
is operating a single pin stack rupiah

171
00:10:44,529 --> 00:10:45,920
six plus the two

172
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:50,878
which might also operated a 60 viewed on
up so unless you take the lock apart

173
00:10:50,879 --> 00:10:55,120
how do you know what's going on well it
turns out if you have a key

174
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:59,310
that works in any door to a master key
system

175
00:10:59,310 --> 00:11:02,829
you can with very little effort very
little cost

176
00:11:02,829 --> 00:11:06,290
and virtually no suspicious activity

177
00:11:06,290 --> 00:11:09,389
completely extrapolate out the top
master key

178
00:11:09,389 --> 00:11:13,660
it's really really simple wyler now
works

179
00:11:13,660 --> 00:11:17,360
alright imagine a hypothetical office

180
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:21,430
in this office we have Alice and we have
bob

181
00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:24,980
and they work on different floors they
work in completely different departments

182
00:11:24,980 --> 00:11:29,730
they have keys to their offices their
keys only work their doors

183
00:11:29,730 --> 00:11:32,889
and around on our example with a few
more people will talk about

184
00:11:32,889 --> 00:11:36,319
here's Andy Andy works in the same floor
as Alice

185
00:11:36,319 --> 00:11:39,748
but again his key only works his door
doesn't work anywhere else

186
00:11:39,749 --> 00:11:42,910
there's also a janitor Charlie

187
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:47,260
and Charlie he's in charge Allison and
he's wearing the building so his key

188
00:11:47,260 --> 00:11:48,990
will work in their office course

189
00:11:48,990 --> 00:11:54,820
his key does not work in Bobst or bob is
more secure environment and

190
00:11:54,820 --> 00:11:57,870
you don't have to start scribbling down
a whole lot of mass and things but I'm

191
00:11:57,870 --> 00:12:01,290
going to give you this is a real master
key system we're about to build

192
00:12:01,290 --> 00:12:04,870
and various times in the stock up I'll
talk about these numbers is bidding

193
00:12:04,870 --> 00:12:05,620
values

194
00:12:05,620 --> 00:12:09,640
as we go around on their keys whenever
you read off a building value: the same

195
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:11,170
need to keep you have a key code cut

196
00:12:11,170 --> 00:12:14,510
their machines that will cut by code
we'll talk about that

197
00:12:14,510 --> 00:12:17,870
you start from the shoulder of the key
and work your way out

198
00:12:17,870 --> 00:12:22,320
so with alice is key remember low
numbers like a zero it would be no cut

199
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:22,690
one

200
00:12:22,690 --> 00:12:25,760
low numbers mean smaller cut so here we
have a three

201
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:29,350
6 to 3 5 does that make sense

202
00:12:29,350 --> 00:12:33,140
alright let's talk about the locks in
their building

203
00:12:33,140 --> 00:12:36,699
well here's same way just other people
here's alice is door

204
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:39,910
below that is Bob store here's and eased
or

205
00:12:39,910 --> 00:12:43,130
Charlie he just sits in the boiler room
he doesn't really matter but you know

206
00:12:43,130 --> 00:12:48,140
he can operate a lot of doors because of
these different values have master pins

207
00:12:48,140 --> 00:12:49,699
mixed in with the key pence

208
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:53,130
so it Alice were to walk around the
whole building

209
00:12:53,130 --> 00:12:56,980
this is alice is key being attempted in
many doors

210
00:12:56,980 --> 00:13:01,100
alice is keen actually opened her door
all the pins are right at the edge in a

211
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:01,550
plug

212
00:13:01,550 --> 00:13:06,120
alice is key looks like it almost work
in any store but it's not perfect

213
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:07,820
there's a few positions that don't work

214
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:12,220
alice is key is not working Bob store
that is alice is key

215
00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:16,190
have an anti well Andy

216
00:13:16,190 --> 00:13:19,399
his keen on working houses door but
assures you that works in his

217
00:13:19,399 --> 00:13:23,250
and of course Bob can't get anywhere
that Sandusky

218
00:13:23,250 --> 00:13:28,020
Bob well he can't do anything on floor
and a

219
00:13:28,020 --> 00:13:32,430
but of course he can operate his own
door this is Bob ski

220
00:13:32,430 --> 00:13:37,089
now something I just wanted to show you
with Charlie the janitor this is what we

221
00:13:37,089 --> 00:13:39,420
would call an intermediate master key

222
00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:43,089
if the system is built in such a way
Charlie

223
00:13:43,089 --> 00:13:46,300
can open alice is door he can open

224
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:49,970
and eased or he cannot open Bobst or
even though it looks

225
00:13:49,970 --> 00:13:53,199
kinda close he can't quite make it some
you in the front can see that

226
00:13:53,199 --> 00:13:56,730
and as possible depending on how
technically you know you really want to

227
00:13:56,730 --> 00:13:59,800
delve into you can build all different
layers have intermediate mastering

228
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:03,860
I owe a huge debt of gratitude

229
00:14:03,860 --> 00:14:07,459
as do most of us I'd say really all of
us an actor community

230
00:14:07,459 --> 00:14:11,709
to Matt blaze a professor down at UPenn
right near where I live in Philly

231
00:14:11,709 --> 00:14:14,990
Matt blaze if you are not familiar with
them I don't know what

232
00:14:14,990 --> 00:14:19,240
rocky been living under not receiving
radio signals but he has put together

233
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:21,860
some of the best research into crypto

234
00:14:21,860 --> 00:14:26,100
awesome code-breaking he's you know he's
a professor is this academic tight

235
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:29,560
but he has this wonderful hacker spirit
that he's carried with him through his

236
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:33,949
original days at phone company labs and
engineering and he's done work on p25

237
00:14:33,949 --> 00:14:35,850
radio encryption he's done work

238
00:14:35,850 --> 00:14:39,190
in so many great fields google his name
it pops up

239
00:14:39,190 --> 00:14:43,970
everywhere he has done great work even
if physical security which is not his

240
00:14:43,970 --> 00:14:48,300
you know field but he approaches it in
this very beautiful computer scientist

241
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:50,260
way the script I'll analyst way

242
00:14:50,260 --> 00:14:53,959
where he's talked about safe cracking
and he's also talked about this master

243
00:14:53,959 --> 00:14:55,100
key vulnerability

244
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:58,899
this is a published attack which when I
first started BSing with some people

245
00:14:58,899 --> 00:14:59,949
about it I said you know

246
00:14:59,949 --> 00:15:02,810
this would be neat if we talked about
this to somebody who hasn't really heard

247
00:15:02,810 --> 00:15:05,110
about before because this is this has
been out there

248
00:15:05,110 --> 00:15:08,310
I wonder if you know where as I said do
you should you should pitch that

249
00:15:08,310 --> 00:15:11,850
might not like that would make a lot of
sense everyone's heard this

250
00:15:11,850 --> 00:15:16,490
event said yeah but like we don't really
do it like no one's ever really actually

251
00:15:16,490 --> 00:15:19,890
done this as an activity maybe maybe
there's interests and I

252
00:15:19,890 --> 00:15:23,959
asked around and that's kinda the
reaction I got one simple yeah like on

253
00:15:23,959 --> 00:15:24,709
Windows Mac

254
00:15:24,709 --> 00:15:29,120
but I've never really like sting that
done sold in our friggin here

255
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:33,050
so thank you to Matt for all the work
that he's put together thanked him for

256
00:15:33,050 --> 00:15:34,000
all the flak

257
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:38,459
he took from locksmiths like I'm pretty
sure there was like a week long period

258
00:15:38,459 --> 00:15:40,380
when Penn might have an opening his mail

259
00:15:40,380 --> 00:15:44,010
is he was getting really angry letters
from people saying why do you talk about

260
00:15:44,010 --> 00:15:44,660
this

261
00:15:44,660 --> 00:15:47,730
but of course you guys in this room you
now talking about

262
00:15:47,730 --> 00:15:51,940
a problem or talking about anything
doesn't make it bad in fact in the end

263
00:15:51,940 --> 00:15:55,649
it usually makes people a lot better in
a lot safer so I thank you guys for

264
00:15:55,649 --> 00:15:57,630
getting that I thank you for being here

265
00:15:57,630 --> 00:16:02,540
in the stop I want to paint a little
picture for you

266
00:16:02,540 --> 00:16:09,540
involves Ouse let's say alice is grown
tired of her time at this company

267
00:16:09,750 --> 00:16:13,470
she wants to leave but maybe a nefarious
you know

268
00:16:13,470 --> 00:16:16,520
other firm says hey you not get an Alice
Lee

269
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:20,610
right so if you're leavin which co

270
00:16:20,610 --> 00:16:26,459
we what somebody's papers that are in
Bob's office you know bob wright

271
00:16:26,459 --> 00:16:31,220
can you get into Bob's office and houses
like I wouldn't do that's what no I

272
00:16:31,220 --> 00:16:33,280
can't I don't have a key that does that

273
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:37,339
and like will totally pay you fifty
thousand dollars and she's lying all

274
00:16:37,339 --> 00:16:40,839
find a way into Bob's office

275
00:16:40,839 --> 00:16:44,290
well ours doesn't have to break down any
doors she doesn't have to bribe guards

276
00:16:44,290 --> 00:16:46,290
she can keep her whole 50

277
00:16:46,290 --> 00:16:49,410
K you know being unscrupulous cos you
wouldn't do this

278
00:16:49,410 --> 00:16:54,569
only bad people this for-profit Alice
doesn't even have to do anything

279
00:16:54,569 --> 00:16:57,770
around bob's office that's where

280
00:16:57,770 --> 00:17:02,689
if you really are far this is like this
is holy shit kinda moment you'll see

281
00:17:02,689 --> 00:17:06,089
allah says a key right she's been
working this company for years it opens

282
00:17:06,089 --> 00:17:09,339
her door Alice has

283
00:17:09,339 --> 00:17:13,359
bidding depp's on her key it is called a
change key by the way because that's the

284
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:13,850
lowest

285
00:17:13,849 --> 00:17:17,089
Ron on the totem pole mastering

286
00:17:17,089 --> 00:17:21,379
using only her change key and only heard
or

287
00:17:21,380 --> 00:17:24,720
Alice can with the aid of some blanks in
a hand file

288
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:27,810
extrapolate out the top master key

289
00:17:27,810 --> 00:17:31,399
let's talk about how that works while
her key

290
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:35,040
which works in her lock you know she can
infer

291
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:39,250
a few things but not a lot she's as well
all the pins right now I mean they're

292
00:17:39,250 --> 00:17:39,620
all

293
00:17:39,620 --> 00:17:43,700
at the edge somewhere clearly it's not
binding if I can turn the key right

294
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:47,380
but beyond that you know she doesn't
know if it's all solid pins it's

295
00:17:47,380 --> 00:17:48,179
probably not

296
00:17:48,179 --> 00:17:50,820
she's in a big building she's like I'm
pretty sure there's mastering in this

297
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:51,270
building

298
00:17:51,270 --> 00:17:55,150
I've seen Charlie janitor he doesn't
have seventy six keys in this is like a

299
00:17:55,150 --> 00:17:57,130
10 floor building

300
00:17:57,130 --> 00:18:00,320
but she doesn't know what specific
details going on

301
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:04,320
and short of taking lock apart she know
that how you know these details a

302
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:07,649
completely hidden inside the cylinder

303
00:18:07,650 --> 00:18:11,320
so whatcha gonna do well alice is going
to prepare

304
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:14,908
exploratory keys and work them as
follows:

305
00:18:14,909 --> 00:18:18,590
this is exploratory key number one

306
00:18:18,590 --> 00:18:22,590
this first position she's leaving a zero
cut

307
00:18:22,590 --> 00:18:26,678
and chill populate out the rest of the
key with billing dept that she already

308
00:18:26,679 --> 00:18:27,950
knows are valid

309
00:18:27,950 --> 00:18:31,280
valid on her change key so we've got 0

310
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:35,770
and then 6235 with me so far

311
00:18:35,770 --> 00:18:39,550
now alice is going to simply sweep

312
00:18:39,550 --> 00:18:44,129
this whole range and see what falls out

313
00:18:44,130 --> 00:18:47,770
sore right now you should be aware
unless you're a locksmith you really

314
00:18:47,770 --> 00:18:50,820
don't have to get deep into what was
called max

315
00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:53,820
maximum adjacent cut specification

316
00:18:53,820 --> 00:18:57,350
but be aware locks can behave strangely

317
00:18:57,350 --> 00:19:00,870
let's say if you violate max too badly
they either will

318
00:19:00,870 --> 00:19:04,409
not open with validating doubts are
sometimes keys will get stuck

319
00:19:04,409 --> 00:19:07,820
for the most part we're not going to get
heavily into that but I'll touch on it

320
00:19:07,820 --> 00:19:08,460
just when it

321
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:12,800
arises in this case this is not a valid
key

322
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:16,050
Alice might even just file down to a one
position in this first

323
00:19:16,050 --> 00:19:19,720
as well nothing is ever 0 like there's
never a blank position

324
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:23,919
can be iight maalox that way and contest
is on a bastard

325
00:19:23,919 --> 00:19:28,330
but no that there could be but let's say
she starts at one

326
00:19:28,330 --> 00:19:31,809
she can do this hand filing pretty
easily with the use of what's called a

327
00:19:31,809 --> 00:19:34,450
key gauge a rekey decoding card

328
00:19:34,450 --> 00:19:38,790
you just take a key slide it into the
not until it stops you know what value

329
00:19:38,790 --> 00:19:43,340
that dept this very convene easier than
calpers let's say

330
00:19:43,340 --> 00:19:46,870
so Alice has this cute she's made
technically this is

331
00:19:46,870 --> 00:19:49,740
still a max violation but again we're
not gonna concern ourselves too much

332
00:19:49,740 --> 00:19:51,030
with that

333
00:19:51,030 --> 00:19:54,840
Alice walks up to her door which she
does every day everyone's hey how you

334
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:56,520
doing has a baby

335
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:59,960
tries a key doesn't work lol

336
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:03,360
she quickly has palm her other key so
she's us is funny

337
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:06,380
switches it out are other Sheila goes in

338
00:20:06,380 --> 00:20:10,120
sup she knows that's not a valid cut
depth is well that doesn't do anything

339
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:11,150
for me

340
00:20:11,150 --> 00:20:14,659
and maybe in the privacy of her officer
in a bathroom stall or depending how

341
00:20:14,659 --> 00:20:16,659
covert you are in a pen test you can

342
00:20:16,659 --> 00:20:19,659
Higdon janitor's closet and other things
I've done filing

343
00:20:19,659 --> 00:20:22,740
in weird places in office buildings be
filed down

344
00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:26,690
to the next billing dept so now she's
got a 26 to 35

345
00:20:26,690 --> 00:20:29,340
how are you guys we're seeing those
billing values can we see them on the

346
00:20:29,340 --> 00:20:30,439
street okay

347
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:34,050
alright maybe the front rows get all
screwed

348
00:20:34,050 --> 00:20:37,860
now notice this looks different because
of course she's hand filing but

349
00:20:37,860 --> 00:20:41,750
the at two opposite this was machine cut
but it's the same value if they're both

350
00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:44,220
the to death

351
00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:47,800
this is no longer a max violation and I
know this because this big head on the

352
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:51,340
key this is a quick set style hat I can
tell it's a quick set system

353
00:20:51,340 --> 00:20:54,699
quickset has a max before chalet is like
a nicer

354
00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:59,580
you notes back shouli pointy fins max if
I think six or seven

355
00:20:59,580 --> 00:21:03,060
but she tries the key again 26 to 35

356
00:21:03,060 --> 00:21:06,360
nope doesn't alright take the key out

357
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:09,980
file it down again tries this in the
lock

358
00:21:09,980 --> 00:21:13,800
hey it opened but that was probably
expected

359
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:17,880
does anyone remember why I was her
original key remember

360
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:21,889
her change he had that same value so
she's just duplicated that

361
00:21:21,889 --> 00:21:25,730
but this does tell her good information
she has learned that

362
00:21:25,730 --> 00:21:29,620
even though she hasn't check these pins
out at all yet she knows this keep in a

363
00:21:29,620 --> 00:21:30,270
solid

364
00:21:30,270 --> 00:21:34,780
she knows there are no intermediate
values from 0 to 3

365
00:21:34,780 --> 00:21:39,300
there could still be something going on
up here though so Alice continues

366
00:21:39,300 --> 00:21:42,710
file down again stick it in the lock

367
00:21:42,710 --> 00:21:46,760
open no try again file down again

368
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:51,710
we got a5 stick in the lock an OPP

369
00:21:51,710 --> 00:21:55,820
filed out again she's got 66 235

370
00:21:55,820 --> 00:22:00,668
how about this hey now that's a little
bit a news

371
00:22:00,669 --> 00:22:05,429
what is ours figured out now well
clearly all drivers have to be out pimp

372
00:22:05,429 --> 00:22:08,040
now apply out the shoreline seven is
raised

373
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:13,280
this is the current picture so now again
we have a touch these other chambers

374
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:16,730
but allah says alright I know this I
know this

375
00:22:16,730 --> 00:22:20,280
maybe there's more share lines but
personally if

376
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:23,570
Iran else's shoes I would just call a
good I would stop

377
00:22:23,570 --> 00:22:27,100
and starts start checking other things
out the system there's you can always go

378
00:22:27,100 --> 00:22:31,260
back you can always take notes you can
always be scribbling its economy revisit

379
00:22:31,260 --> 00:22:32,000
this

380
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:36,510
I'm gonna give you the most efficient
way to bang through this process

381
00:22:36,510 --> 00:22:40,580
and as you try later maybe somebody's
gonna lock opening contest involving

382
00:22:40,580 --> 00:22:41,750
this technology

383
00:22:41,750 --> 00:22:45,740
maybe you're gonna want to be as
efficient and fast as you can

384
00:22:45,740 --> 00:22:50,370
so again you could keep on going if you
want to try seven

385
00:22:50,370 --> 00:22:54,540
an OK didn't do anything you keep on
going to the bottom but remember click

386
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:56,590
Set still can't go past seven so

387
00:22:56,590 --> 00:22:59,810
if there is more to bidding range you
could hit I wouldn't even be doing that

388
00:22:59,810 --> 00:23:01,870
at this point

389
00:23:01,870 --> 00:23:06,190
but now alice is alright I'm gonna
prepare another exploratory key

390
00:23:06,190 --> 00:23:09,669
and houses really breaking the bank
considering the blankies are won a

391
00:23:09,669 --> 00:23:12,610
dollar fifty at Home Depot

392
00:23:12,610 --> 00:23:16,429
so alice is discovered a master value in
this first chamber

393
00:23:16,429 --> 00:23:19,760
design remember what it was sex

394
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:23,820
she's gonna leave a blank value in this
position here 0 Kat

395
00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:27,820
anyone remember the last three
ever-changing

396
00:23:27,820 --> 00:23:31,760
yes 235 the value she already knows

397
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:35,830
stick this in the lock now of course the
zero depth is never used

398
00:23:35,830 --> 00:23:40,389
so you could save time you could start
with the one DEP

399
00:23:40,389 --> 00:23:43,720
Mac supports being violated don't worry
about it too much

400
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:48,030
be worry about maxine accusing come back
out I'll be annoyed at you if you forgot

401
00:23:48,030 --> 00:23:49,440
my contest locks

402
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:52,980
you'll be much more know yourself if
it's like 2am in Europe and test job and

403
00:23:52,980 --> 00:23:57,460
you can get keys on a lock in your life
own shit this sucks

404
00:23:57,460 --> 00:24:00,810
I've totally done that so alright

405
00:24:00,810 --> 00:24:04,370
we've got a 6-1 235 try the key

406
00:24:04,370 --> 00:24:07,490
doesn't open alright take it out

407
00:24:07,490 --> 00:24:11,260
file down 6-2 235 max is OK

408
00:24:11,260 --> 00:24:15,030
how we doing here try the key doesn't
open

409
00:24:15,030 --> 00:24:18,629
file down again 63 235

410
00:24:18,629 --> 00:24:22,010
try to key nope

411
00:24:22,010 --> 00:24:25,810
filed out again keep on going easy did
you notice you don't need a new key

412
00:24:25,810 --> 00:24:26,550
every time

413
00:24:26,550 --> 00:24:31,310
you can just keep working the same
blankie paid a whole dollar 54

414
00:24:31,310 --> 00:24:34,950
hey look at 6'4 235 lot just opened

415
00:24:34,950 --> 00:24:38,649
now Alice knows a serious been a
business here

416
00:24:38,649 --> 00:24:42,450
clearly the drivers have to be at the
plugs edge she already knew the first

417
00:24:42,450 --> 00:24:44,200
chamber that she explored

418
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:49,120
but look you know we have we have a a
new line she knows there's another one

419
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:50,929
up here already from her key

420
00:24:50,929 --> 00:24:54,970
this is a lot of good information we
don't know anything about these further

421
00:24:54,970 --> 00:24:56,010
depth but now

422
00:24:56,010 --> 00:24:59,690
this chamber is kinda done why is that

423
00:24:59,690 --> 00:25:04,129
was not just because it's rare to find
more than once your line

424
00:25:04,129 --> 00:25:07,379
it's not possible but in most
environmentally joining the huge

425
00:25:07,379 --> 00:25:11,450
fireman its kinda rare there's also the
consideration

426
00:25:11,450 --> 00:25:15,580
I'll master pins that are too small

427
00:25:15,580 --> 00:25:19,149
what I mean by that well we know
obviously that this is a sheer lines

428
00:25:19,149 --> 00:25:19,899
that has got to be a

429
00:25:19,899 --> 00:25:23,270
a double-height master pin here we're
basically done

430
00:25:23,270 --> 00:25:27,840
why because master pins that are really
small and I mean like

431
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:31,750
one depp's in height are a bad thing

432
00:25:31,750 --> 00:25:36,639
they fuck shit up sometimes they flip
this they get messed up if the lot they

433
00:25:36,639 --> 00:25:37,530
they cause

434
00:25:37,530 --> 00:25:41,040
headaches and most locksmiths will try
to avoid

435
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:45,560
using them it's not to say I'll never
see 'em I've built master systems II

436
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:47,480
studies one once in a while

437
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:51,490
the matter systems big enough but it's
not common

438
00:25:51,490 --> 00:25:54,970
specially not comin to stack to them
together so

439
00:25:54,970 --> 00:26:00,010
also say well alright luck it's unlikely
that a five dept is going to exist

440
00:26:00,010 --> 00:26:02,940
you could take the key you know you
could just try the six to make sure you

441
00:26:02,940 --> 00:26:04,260
still file incorrectly

442
00:26:04,260 --> 00:26:08,020
some people I really am i really doing
this right how's my filing yet opens s

443
00:26:08,020 --> 00:26:12,080
her right and now what is what's deeper
than that well in the system

444
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:16,899
you know 7 is the only deep depth that
it exists beyond this

445
00:26:16,899 --> 00:26:20,540
law that involved I would also involve a
single dept master which is probably a

446
00:26:20,540 --> 00:26:21,658
bad idea

447
00:26:21,659 --> 00:26:24,850
so again if I we're doing this I would
just toss it move on

448
00:26:24,850 --> 00:26:28,200
I would say I think I've discovered my
other share line

449
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:32,899
move on a per fare another and other key
to explore the next chamber

450
00:26:32,899 --> 00:26:37,030
so we're prepared third exploratory key
what values gonna go over and above the

451
00:26:37,030 --> 00:26:39,970
shoulder

452
00:26:39,970 --> 00:26:46,040
say it yes 6 what value we discover the
next position

453
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:50,250
it will be a floor without the floor is
this a valid King

454
00:26:50,250 --> 00:26:53,980
no because max is violated but again
don't worry about that

455
00:26:53,980 --> 00:26:57,440
so here is what 4 yes

456
00:26:57,440 --> 00:27:00,780
how about the next position right on

457
00:27:00,780 --> 00:27:04,700
0 goes in the blank as you're about to
sweep that range and the rest

458
00:27:04,700 --> 00:27:08,500
is what exactly geyser paying attention

459
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:12,830
sweet I like when people listen don't
fall asleep 35

460
00:27:12,830 --> 00:27:16,230
so now it's time to sweep this range
right time to explore

461
00:27:16,230 --> 00:27:22,020
or is it let's talk about being a little
bit more efficient in here

462
00:27:22,020 --> 00:27:26,480
does anyone remember her known depth it
was a chip

463
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:30,050
so what's right above to one what's
right below to

464
00:27:30,050 --> 00:27:33,850
3 you don't really need to explore the
one in the three because that would

465
00:27:33,850 --> 00:27:34,409
involve

466
00:27:34,409 --> 00:27:38,090
a single depth master which would be bad
you don't really need the frigate to

467
00:27:38,090 --> 00:27:41,320
either cuz if you're confident you've
been filing a few times now you kinda

468
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:43,158
know your filings doing

469
00:27:43,159 --> 00:27:48,290
so you can honestly start this one of
four why waste your event I'm

470
00:27:48,290 --> 00:27:51,870
try this much more fish in range to
explore

471
00:27:51,870 --> 00:27:55,010
artist he's prepared Alice goes in

472
00:27:55,010 --> 00:27:58,399
tries in the lock doesn't earn by the
way

473
00:27:58,399 --> 00:28:02,629
as Alice what to any other office yet in
this process

474
00:28:02,629 --> 00:28:06,919
now take ski-out file this position down
a little bit

475
00:28:06,919 --> 00:28:10,250
got a 5% cut try this in the lock

476
00:28:10,250 --> 00:28:14,780
well 1 well oh open that's always nice
to hear xanh XE

477
00:28:14,780 --> 00:28:19,480
open when you get a lock open so now
what we got

478
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:22,800
allah says the pens have to be at the
edge it's probably like this

479
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:25,830
she knew her own Dept she found a depth
below it

480
00:28:25,830 --> 00:28:30,070
I would call that good let's explore
these guys were gonna find things out

481
00:28:30,070 --> 00:28:31,629
about them

482
00:28:31,629 --> 00:28:36,080
this is pretty dialed in here again why
waste your time you can always go back

483
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:39,889
later he was always go back with another
key if you really think you screwed

484
00:28:39,889 --> 00:28:41,919
something up

485
00:28:41,919 --> 00:28:45,950
so alright would we need to explore the
six steps on this

486
00:28:45,950 --> 00:28:49,549
I would now I mean this there's a chance
but again

487
00:28:49,549 --> 00:28:54,400
bad idea have a7 I wouldn't move the
hell on

488
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:57,929
prepare the fourth key you guys already
know what's going on what you found so

489
00:28:57,929 --> 00:28:58,760
far

490
00:28:58,760 --> 00:29:03,250
give it a zero round that was watching
out sweep this range

491
00:29:03,250 --> 00:29:06,570
this of course violates max as long as
it's not get stuck in the door we're not

492
00:29:06,570 --> 00:29:08,090
gonna tell anyone

493
00:29:08,090 --> 00:29:11,580
cell their is a third up here

494
00:29:11,580 --> 00:29:15,610
if you know that you could always skip
the two in the four see just a one five

495
00:29:15,610 --> 00:29:16,900
six seven

496
00:29:16,900 --> 00:29:20,039
why not play again stay away from single
away

497
00:29:20,039 --> 00:29:24,720
values so start up with the one throw in
the lock doesn't work

498
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:27,770
no start of next if you really wanted

499
00:29:27,770 --> 00:29:31,200
you could go to the value you know again
just test your filing

500
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:34,150
doesn't hurt to make sure your file
incorrectly yeah it opened I was

501
00:29:34,150 --> 00:29:36,159
expecting that

502
00:29:36,159 --> 00:29:39,309
alright city on it I would file down
again I'd skip

503
00:29:39,309 --> 00:29:42,799
and around five tried the lock

504
00:29:42,799 --> 00:29:46,750
nope say all right filed under: sex

505
00:29:46,750 --> 00:29:49,860
tried on the lock

506
00:29:49,860 --> 00:29:53,110
27 I mean I know that deviants said they
sometimes you seven

507
00:29:53,110 --> 00:29:58,450
in master systems with quick sellers
church has seven back

508
00:29:58,450 --> 00:30:03,270
so now you got a problem may like David
bringing guy told me to be all fish into

509
00:30:03,270 --> 00:30:05,400
I'm skippin values like a maniac in

510
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:08,809
damn WTF mate

511
00:30:08,809 --> 00:30:12,120
well maybe that's the fax

512
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:15,309
sometimes you have you know chambers
just on mastered

513
00:30:15,309 --> 00:30:19,399
you my question whether the file
correctly but I'll just question lock

514
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:23,279
maybe position for snow mastered give it
a little re-designed I give you a

515
00:30:23,279 --> 00:30:24,919
question mark on your paperwork

516
00:30:24,919 --> 00:30:27,990
coming back to it later you have a
problem

517
00:30:27,990 --> 00:30:31,850
so this is what we think we got so far
maybe three the same value that was on

518
00:30:31,850 --> 00:30:32,820
her change key

519
00:30:32,820 --> 00:30:36,760
might just be the master value may just
be the only value

520
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:40,669
so we gotta prepare 50 right what we
know

521
00:30:40,669 --> 00:30:44,460
what we want sweep the range sweep the
leg Johnny

522
00:30:44,460 --> 00:30:47,600
alright prepare

523
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:52,070
using I'm gonna skip to zero what this
probably never a zero value

524
00:30:52,070 --> 00:30:55,178
of course if you want you know it
doesn't hurt take a second to try it

525
00:30:55,179 --> 00:30:58,630
it's always easy to file its that
attract glue shavings back on a key you

526
00:30:58,630 --> 00:31:00,360
can't put a key back together right

527
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:03,549
so maybe try maybe you don't but started
to one if you want

528
00:31:03,549 --> 00:31:08,408
stake in the lock what happens well who
opened that was a quick hit on that

529
00:31:08,409 --> 00:31:08,970
lottery

530
00:31:08,970 --> 00:31:12,090
that is a heaping bowl of win

531
00:31:12,090 --> 00:31:15,539
because you've probably got this whole
system now

532
00:31:15,539 --> 00:31:19,230
you've probably decoded it all you know
there's another value out here for you

533
00:31:19,230 --> 00:31:20,789
don't give a shit about it

534
00:31:20,789 --> 00:31:24,260
you could sweep the resting its a maybe
there's intermediate mastering I don't

535
00:31:24,260 --> 00:31:26,150
know what's going on here let's keep
filing

536
00:31:26,150 --> 00:31:30,169
hell with that I would just are throwing
this key lock the door since to see what

537
00:31:30,169 --> 00:31:32,120
the hell it to us

538
00:31:32,120 --> 00:31:35,659
maybe make a nice fresh cut copy of it
if you have access to a code cutting

539
00:31:35,659 --> 00:31:36,470
machine

540
00:31:36,470 --> 00:31:39,549
if you don't you'll be walking around
key looks like this

541
00:31:39,549 --> 00:31:42,668
all suspicious if someone's walking
right up to you but again

542
00:31:42,669 --> 00:31:45,770
a less to looking at closely this is the
first

543
00:31:45,770 --> 00:31:50,850
time you'll never be walking around to
adore that's not yours if you tryin this

544
00:31:50,850 --> 00:31:54,720
so now house can walk around lamb lamb
lamb lamb lamb every door in the

545
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:55,480
building

546
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:58,659
open to her now with picking not with
crouching

547
00:31:58,659 --> 00:32:02,539
not with looking over shot just walk up
to the door act like you belong

548
00:32:02,539 --> 00:32:05,789
you guys know social engineering you're
on the phone what

549
00:32:05,789 --> 00:32:10,610
they can't put me on the 905 have you
told them about my frequent flyer miles

550
00:32:10,610 --> 00:32:14,340
alright how the %uh go to the meeting
you know just breeze right and if you

551
00:32:14,340 --> 00:32:17,970
got Aquino was gonna question that shit

552
00:32:17,970 --> 00:32:22,580
absolutely easy to do man the only thing
you're gonna release yourself on with

553
00:32:22,580 --> 00:32:25,250
hand filing is not being noticed by
security

554
00:32:25,250 --> 00:32:28,940
unless you like filing at your desk at
don't do that

555
00:32:28,940 --> 00:32:33,100
you now one time we did in a meeting
room like we we just got tired running

556
00:32:33,100 --> 00:32:35,679
back down to the lobby bathroom in this
one building a penetrating

557
00:32:35,679 --> 00:32:39,919
we just sat in a meeting room sometimes
its us a great story

558
00:32:39,919 --> 00:32:43,380
I wish I actually get a credit for this
like looking like you belong there

559
00:32:43,380 --> 00:32:46,870
I know a person who breezed in with a
briefcase and was followed like family

560
00:32:46,870 --> 00:32:47,520
photos

561
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:52,710
coffee mod and they just sat at a
cubicle and put all their stuff out

562
00:32:52,710 --> 00:32:56,250
and like nobody questioning went back
each day for a week

563
00:32:56,250 --> 00:33:00,700
they had like card from the Y Asian now
we just took the meeting room

564
00:33:00,700 --> 00:33:04,130
and I was in there like filing filing
bobbitt's like on his machine polling

565
00:33:04,130 --> 00:33:04,940
and network

566
00:33:04,940 --> 00:33:08,779
and some guy comes in like 20 I thought
this rooms free my leg now we're in here

567
00:33:08,779 --> 00:33:11,130
we had it blocked off on the calendar on
that

568
00:33:11,130 --> 00:33:16,270
internal website that I hope this
company has that I'm referencing

569
00:33:16,270 --> 00:33:19,330
so yeah the only you not gonna get
noticed unless you're crazy the only

570
00:33:19,330 --> 00:33:22,720
problem with filing you may actually
have is what I call canyoning

571
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:27,020
canyoning is gonna get your keys stuck
EC understand why

572
00:33:27,020 --> 00:33:31,379
if the key the pins are riding up the
front blade niceties if they drop in

573
00:33:31,380 --> 00:33:35,070
getting the key back out that's getting
harder

574
00:33:35,070 --> 00:33:38,379
so you get this is the internals
analysis lock

575
00:33:38,380 --> 00:33:41,950
these little marks if you can see the
white lines they represent the mastering

576
00:33:41,950 --> 00:33:43,730
Depp's Alice has discovered

577
00:33:43,730 --> 00:33:47,429
you can have an alternate lock in the
system I think this is Bob lock if I

578
00:33:47,429 --> 00:33:48,399
recall

579
00:33:48,399 --> 00:33:51,950
and again the key you just discovered a
work in there it should work in every

580
00:33:51,950 --> 00:33:53,820
door if it's the top master key

581
00:33:53,820 --> 00:33:57,918
decoded so super when R is you man like

582
00:33:57,919 --> 00:34:02,640
this is easy stuff to pull off and most
locks are vulnerable

583
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:07,149
can you mitigate against this some sort
of there's the idea restricted key ways

584
00:34:07,149 --> 00:34:08,560
or restricted blanks

585
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:12,179
all that means is that the keyway
profile the actual shape

586
00:34:12,179 --> 00:34:15,750
has been patented or copyrighted it's
under protection

587
00:34:15,750 --> 00:34:20,529
in in basically in the art so
manufactures a blank keys who

588
00:34:20,529 --> 00:34:24,270
art the company who make the lock those
blanks can't get on the market

589
00:34:24,270 --> 00:34:27,659
as easily you can still mill blank keys
with a machine called

590
00:34:27,659 --> 00:34:30,679
easy entry machine ages reads the side
profile

591
00:34:30,679 --> 00:34:35,190
keys and start smelling them a lovely
story I don't think I have a photo of it

592
00:34:35,190 --> 00:34:37,940
the easy entry company got you know they
can get in some trouble with their

593
00:34:37,940 --> 00:34:38,810
clients or

594
00:34:38,810 --> 00:34:41,980
locksmiths they they say hey we're gonna
start telling his locksmiths that

595
00:34:41,980 --> 00:34:44,510
they're violating you know restricted
blank rules

596
00:34:44,510 --> 00:34:48,339
if they start copying people's up let
you know making key that's our profile

597
00:34:48,339 --> 00:34:51,440
so easy entry wonderful German company

598
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:55,710
there there bill itself metal to go in
the cold relax the billet metal had two

599
00:34:55,710 --> 00:34:57,029
holes here in a hole in it

600
00:34:57,029 --> 00:35:00,580
and would milled on the side so if you
have the strikers were gonna do if you

601
00:35:00,580 --> 00:35:02,839
have a profile on its restricted

602
00:35:02,839 --> 00:35:06,240
so the lock might have awarded medal
here and awarded medal

603
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:09,830
here so if you wanna Mila ke make a
black

604
00:35:09,830 --> 00:35:12,910
that would be a cut here and cut here

605
00:35:12,910 --> 00:35:15,730
and they said no no no thats restricted
you can't do that so easy entry said all

606
00:35:15,730 --> 00:35:17,140
right

607
00:35:17,140 --> 00:35:20,970
turn on you know like special copy beer
fuck you mod

608
00:35:20,970 --> 00:35:24,400
adolescent ago cut here

609
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:29,290
come here for no reason a cut he recover
more here

610
00:35:29,290 --> 00:35:33,540
and it's a new shape and the Rolex that
they start shipping the blanks

611
00:35:33,540 --> 00:35:37,870
they have a whole here whole year and a
nice smiley face right on the key

612
00:35:37,870 --> 00:35:42,980
so the Lego yeah I got their distinctive
laugh

613
00:35:42,980 --> 00:35:46,350
but and in truth you know you don't
mitigate this just by restricting the

614
00:35:46,350 --> 00:35:46,839
metal

615
00:35:46,839 --> 00:35:50,140
it's out there people getting blanks can
happen you should have secondary

616
00:35:50,140 --> 00:35:53,770
monitoring systems use them door open
sensors if you have a big proper

617
00:35:53,770 --> 00:35:54,580
building should be

618
00:35:54,580 --> 00:35:59,170
auditing when people can come and go you
get a completely separate zones in your

619
00:35:59,170 --> 00:35:59,859
building

620
00:35:59,859 --> 00:36:04,640
where just the mastering and one really
top tier floor that has nothing to do

621
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:08,080
with the bidding cuts are the master in
Penza anywhere else in the building

622
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:11,740
separate ring keys entirely but
essentially if you really wanna be

623
00:36:11,740 --> 00:36:13,700
highly awesome you can move away

624
00:36:13,700 --> 00:36:17,279
to other badass lot design just move
away from plane pens

625
00:36:17,279 --> 00:36:21,760
sidebar base locks examples or be the
OSA twin this lake

626
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:25,690
up the slick Primus these are all
systems that interact with

627
00:36:25,690 --> 00:36:29,730
extra elements on the key but yes it's
possible to attack some of these

628
00:36:29,730 --> 00:36:33,529
but it's harder it's certainly harder
than just you know sitting there with a

629
00:36:33,529 --> 00:36:35,100
hand file you not gonna make

630
00:36:35,100 --> 00:36:38,109
sidebar cuts now others

631
00:36:38,109 --> 00:36:42,130
finish here in the fact that if you have
a sidebar based system like this

632
00:36:42,130 --> 00:36:45,170
in one door for building and the doors
mastered

633
00:36:45,170 --> 00:36:48,170
is probably likely that the same sidebar

634
00:36:48,170 --> 00:36:52,170
is in every other door in that building
there are some companies have made ways

635
00:36:52,170 --> 00:36:52,420
a

636
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:56,020
around this but for the most part if you
have access if you are the

637
00:36:56,020 --> 00:36:59,720
authorized user on the door you have a
key it may leak a lot of information out

638
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:01,040
actually you can use

639
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:04,480
some locks have only a sidebar

640
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:08,790
see have this awesome way for bass lock
from the Austrian company Avon we love

641
00:37:08,790 --> 00:37:12,730
this is their three Ks their three
curves system uses the sliders

642
00:37:12,730 --> 00:37:16,600
rotating disc locks are axle in this
regard

643
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:20,020
rotating disc locks have a little we'll
pack that essentially is like a

644
00:37:20,020 --> 00:37:21,200
miniature safe

645
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:25,250
a buncha wheels all have to be turned
exactly right so that gates are not just

646
00:37:25,250 --> 00:37:26,819
line up a bar drops in

647
00:37:26,819 --> 00:37:31,089
two beautiful design you can master
rotating disk systems

648
00:37:31,089 --> 00:37:34,830
you can actually build extra wafers
blind wafers when you put the stack

649
00:37:34,830 --> 00:37:35,569
together

650
00:37:35,569 --> 00:37:38,609
we don't have to get into the whole
functioning how these how these locks

651
00:37:38,609 --> 00:37:39,380
work

652
00:37:39,380 --> 00:37:42,460
but when you build the pack up you can't
put

653
00:37:42,460 --> 00:37:45,560
you can you can put blank wafers in some
lower-level ox

654
00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:49,870
you can actually make that the system
masterful now not every locksmith out

655
00:37:49,870 --> 00:37:51,920
there knows how to do this

656
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:55,250
there's one locksmith you know here at
Hope who actually can

657
00:37:55,250 --> 00:37:58,920
if anybody is downstairs and talk to the
guys at the security snobs

658
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:02,200
anybody know mitchell EC mitch is
security stops both him and Sam are down

659
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:02,839
there

660
00:38:02,839 --> 00:38:06,069
talk to that mitch is an apple a dealer
he's a up full disclosure is a friend

661
00:38:06,069 --> 00:38:06,660
Mark's

662
00:38:06,660 --> 00:38:09,430
the world we'll a month running
businesses were the only people who can

663
00:38:09,430 --> 00:38:11,500
build at least systems like this

664
00:38:11,500 --> 00:38:14,930
but he can build you a secure you know
master tablet system

665
00:38:14,930 --> 00:38:18,529
one in which even if someone you know
steals the low-level lock

666
00:38:18,529 --> 00:38:21,930
like I have a lot of things like travel
someone to take the locking just cut it

667
00:38:21,930 --> 00:38:22,600
open

668
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:26,670
and it's not going to leak out the full
top master level codes

669
00:38:26,670 --> 00:38:30,900
jean houston that too right like if
Alice were not so finesse

670
00:38:30,900 --> 00:38:34,850
minded she just ripped the door knob of
and double a bit she could measure the

671
00:38:34,850 --> 00:38:38,730
Pens just get all the building codes
right there

672
00:38:38,730 --> 00:38:41,710
but again you not gonna do that with a
rotating disk system you're not also

673
00:38:41,710 --> 00:38:44,060
going to have an easy time who in
magnetic base lock

674
00:38:44,060 --> 00:38:48,440
the me la company in Japan uses these
amazing magnetic sliders on the you know

675
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:50,020
that work with the key

676
00:38:50,020 --> 00:38:54,509
the again fr company in Austria Boyd
best magnet base lock I've ever seen you

677
00:38:54,510 --> 00:38:58,330
may have heard us talk about the MCS the
magnetic code system

678
00:38:58,330 --> 00:39:01,730
got this amazing he right and the
seasonality this law's

679
00:39:01,730 --> 00:39:05,279
way be track on the side in these big
magnetic paddles

680
00:39:05,279 --> 00:39:08,850
so they must be like maybe there's some
north's in South San there

681
00:39:08,850 --> 00:39:12,750
there is just not the way you think
there are possibly this key has these

682
00:39:12,750 --> 00:39:16,589
you know being round dots on both sides
and a lot of people see it they say cool

683
00:39:16,589 --> 00:39:21,040
Magnani lock right i mean which house
how often do they switch north and south

684
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:24,350
I do a lot is each one of those desks

685
00:39:24,350 --> 00:39:28,650
is a discrete zone of north-south that
is rotated in two different axial

686
00:39:28,650 --> 00:39:29,760
positions

687
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:34,299
and flipped opposite on the other side
the internal workings the lock have many

688
00:39:34,299 --> 00:39:35,660
rotors that spin

689
00:39:35,660 --> 00:39:39,890
to allow fingers a sidebar to drop in do
you think

690
00:39:39,890 --> 00:39:43,150
that the plug wall by the way in the
keyway has to be

691
00:39:43,150 --> 00:39:46,279
open in any way for that to work now

692
00:39:46,279 --> 00:39:50,190
to seal system the magnetism just
radiates out through the housing

693
00:39:50,190 --> 00:39:54,160
it's a beautiful lock resistant against
dirt fouling corrosion resistance

694
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:55,690
against all kind of attacks

695
00:39:55,690 --> 00:39:59,380
try to make you know keys that are
restricted I gonna make this key

696
00:39:59,380 --> 00:40:02,400
our German friends made a a fake he
wants

697
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:06,540
by using tiny chunks needed me a minute
key the kinda setup included into place

698
00:40:06,540 --> 00:40:07,660
in the gotta open

699
00:40:07,660 --> 00:40:11,480
one time after reading the real key I
think love the magnets when it popped

700
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:14,279
off in the locker don't know how well
that worked

701
00:40:14,279 --> 00:40:17,510
but I mean it like no scissors and the
guys in SS death

702
00:40:17,510 --> 00:40:21,210
they're just like boom these are my
balls were awesome

703
00:40:21,210 --> 00:40:25,060
it was amazing to see it happen but
still it's not a practical attack in a

704
00:40:25,060 --> 00:40:28,779
real sense and that's a damn secure
system

705
00:40:28,779 --> 00:40:31,810
so again beautiful stuff is out there
but

706
00:40:31,810 --> 00:40:35,740
most locks are like this most locked in
his plane pins

707
00:40:35,740 --> 00:40:39,700
and if you wanna try to attack them well
like don't want you to do this in a

708
00:40:39,700 --> 00:40:42,010
building where you're not supposed to be
doing this

709
00:40:42,010 --> 00:40:47,049
so why don't you do here at Hope we have
a new contest for your help

710
00:40:47,049 --> 00:40:50,779
we have some interesting things for your
you're going to start to see

711
00:40:50,779 --> 00:40:54,279
starting tomorrow these pillars appear
around

712
00:40:54,279 --> 00:40:57,870
different spots in the cons base is
gonna be four of them

713
00:40:57,870 --> 00:41:02,620
and these towers have locks in them
please just believe me when I tell you

714
00:41:02,620 --> 00:41:05,880
is not me throwing it down misdirection
and false info

715
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:10,330
each lock is the same lock in every
tower why did I do it three site three

716
00:41:10,330 --> 00:41:11,120
times each tower

717
00:41:11,120 --> 00:41:15,779
cuz some non not is gonna file to Kieron
get stuck to break something I don't

718
00:41:15,779 --> 00:41:18,600
want the contest to come crashing down
when that happened

719
00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:22,770
so I built the locks three times that
said please don't fuck up my locks

720
00:41:22,770 --> 00:41:23,960
during this contest

721
00:41:23,960 --> 00:41:27,670
people get mad at you I will get mad at
you

722
00:41:27,670 --> 00:41:32,089
but these locks represent harlem as
Turkey's system there's gonna be tower

723
00:41:32,089 --> 00:41:34,089
abc&d

724
00:41:34,089 --> 00:41:38,080
by the way these towers which are all
wood could really use some weight

725
00:41:38,080 --> 00:41:41,290
on the back at them to hold them up if
you are buying might have to be like the

726
00:41:41,290 --> 00:41:42,589
cum outta here

727
00:41:42,589 --> 00:41:45,609
groom up to you yet the empties

728
00:41:45,609 --> 00:41:48,900
those bring them back down to the guys
and that the mezzanine level given

729
00:41:48,900 --> 00:41:51,700
to them they're gonna put em in cases
for us we're gonna use that to weigh

730
00:41:51,700 --> 00:41:52,560
down

731
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:56,930
the the pieces what if you could be so
kind

732
00:41:56,930 --> 00:42:00,990
we'll see these towers around the
grounds there's going to be a box

733
00:42:00,990 --> 00:42:04,940
up keys that we have their is a small
buy in

734
00:42:04,940 --> 00:42:08,190
to this contest there there's a lot of
different ways that you can kick in

735
00:42:08,190 --> 00:42:10,540
money to help support tool but I'll
explain in a minute

736
00:42:10,540 --> 00:42:13,770
but for a very small buy in price by the
five bucks

737
00:42:13,770 --> 00:42:17,580
you can reach into this been and pull
out a key

738
00:42:17,580 --> 00:42:21,120
and the reason we are charging is to
dissuade people from China brutally

739
00:42:21,120 --> 00:42:23,630
attacked by just try to keep getting all
the keys

740
00:42:23,630 --> 00:42:27,600
poll all the keys on his if you compare
bunch different keys

741
00:42:27,600 --> 00:42:31,029
you can start already get information
about a master key system you can start

742
00:42:31,029 --> 00:42:32,990
hey this looks a little close to that
one

743
00:42:32,990 --> 00:42:36,279
so we're trying to dissuade people from
doing that now you wanna be like Big Joe

744
00:42:36,279 --> 00:42:38,980
moneybags whatever you can just keep
throwing five zealous

745
00:42:38,980 --> 00:42:41,710
we're not gonna let you see we're
grabbing see you might just pull up

746

747
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:46,370
shacks that might happen but you know

748
00:42:46,370 --> 00:42:50,290

752
00:43:03,660 --> 00:43:05,399
under my name I have to go ask

753
00:43:05,400 --> 00:43:09,270
there will be key gauge is a people want
to buy them to work on them that's fine

754
00:43:09,270 --> 00:43:12,350
you can buy a mall there will be a
couple reserved in the village for

755
00:43:12,350 --> 00:43:14,000
people to do this for free

00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:17,950
you can decode your keys start building
yourself a chart

757
00:43:17,950 --> 00:43:21,790
there are hand files free to file down

758
00:43:21,790 --> 00:43:24,850
exploratory keys start sweeping with the
keys

759
00:43:24,850 --> 00:43:28,130
if you don't trust your filing skills or
if you want to you know get a little

760
00:43:28,130 --> 00:43:33,220
extra help there was one other thing I
threw in my luggage on the way here

761
00:43:33,220 --> 00:43:37,710
yes we did bring an ill culture code
machine with us to hope

762
00:43:37,710 --> 00:43:42,370
it might be really noisy so not applied
yet until the Statler guys like thrown a

763
00:43:42,370 --> 00:43:45,100
lot of stuff at us from making too much
noise in the radio booth

764
00:43:45,100 --> 00:43:50,299
but we will code cut you a key again you
wanna brute force this entire contest

765
00:43:50,299 --> 00:43:54,069
you can fun tool like throw money at all
will cut you a buncha keys

766
00:43:54,069 --> 00:43:57,980
whatever tools nonprofit and we could

767
00:43:57,980 --> 00:44:01,460
but you go around you see I got my key

768
00:44:01,460 --> 00:44:05,000
tried again run back down why was it
running back down well because the key

769
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:06,810
machines gonna live in the village

770
00:44:06,810 --> 00:44:10,000
and we're going to impose a rule that if
the staff here work with us

771
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:13,029
and if you can you know pointed out
something else no

772
00:44:13,029 --> 00:44:17,120
filing have keys outside the village
cell

773
00:44:17,120 --> 00:44:20,740
much like in an office we don't wanna
look suspicious if other teams

774
00:44:20,740 --> 00:44:25,029
see you like trying to key file and he
trying to keep if they snap a photo love

775
00:44:25,029 --> 00:44:26,509
you filing a key

776
00:44:26,509 --> 00:44:31,600
outside the village you Rd cute you are
disqualified you are not covert

777
00:44:31,600 --> 00:44:35,910
cell running back down the village file
a key measure key run back up where the

778
00:44:35,910 --> 00:44:36,670
thing is try to keep

779
00:44:36,670 --> 00:44:42,200
run back to this can be a lotta hackers
losing some weight this weekend

780
00:44:42,200 --> 00:44:46,299
if you think you figured out the top
master key

781
00:44:46,299 --> 00:44:50,040
you could double check yourself and run
around to the other locks that you said

782
00:44:50,040 --> 00:44:51,810
hey is working here are some

783
00:44:51,810 --> 00:44:55,009
but this big lock bored with these three
which again I promise you they're all

784
00:44:55,009 --> 00:44:55,560
the same

785
00:44:55,560 --> 00:44:59,130
is gonna be in the lockpick village in
our front table

786
00:44:59,130 --> 00:45:02,690
if you walk up the first three teams to
give us keys

787
00:45:02,690 --> 00:45:06,440
woman on the start to turn these locks
if the key is in it turns by the way we

788
00:45:06,440 --> 00:45:09,370
ask you to keep it in there so no one
else is sneaking a peek

789
00:45:09,370 --> 00:45:12,410
you get price what prizes we haven't
figured out yet

790
00:45:12,410 --> 00:45:16,060
I'm gonna go by this you know top my
head and say free admission to hope next

791
00:45:16,060 --> 00:45:17,589
year that all PayPal or

792
00:45:17,589 --> 00:45:20,569
about two hundred dollar credit the
village fifty dollar credit the village

793
00:45:20,569 --> 00:45:24,580
sound good what I think

794
00:45:24,580 --> 00:45:30,170
alright thank you bob for missing your
flight I just made that rule about my

795
00:45:30,170 --> 00:45:31,910
ass

796
00:45:31,910 --> 00:45:35,490
directors vote by proxy is that one

797
00:45:35,490 --> 00:45:39,790
so yeah are you gonna win are you gonna
try I don't know I think you can

798
00:45:39,790 --> 00:45:43,299
I think you could totally pull this off
if you do

799
00:45:43,299 --> 00:45:46,400
that will be awesome we would really
love that we wanna see people trying

800
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:49,009
this out how many people have never
actually done

801
00:45:49,009 --> 00:45:53,310
an escalation attack like this not too
many hands and you probably did in

802
00:45:53,310 --> 00:45:56,270
college or something when you try to get
another dorm rooms and stuff like that

803
00:45:56,270 --> 00:45:57,069
yeah

804
00:45:57,069 --> 00:46:00,890
so we we wanted this contest because we
think it is kinda material that

805
00:46:00,890 --> 00:46:04,328
even though people have talked about not
a lot of people have done

806
00:46:04,329 --> 00:46:08,390
so that's why I came up with this little
game you know tool is all about games in

807
00:46:08,390 --> 00:46:09,150
public fun

808
00:46:09,150 --> 00:46:13,490
to Liz you know all about just teaching
the community we love all these locks

809
00:46:13,490 --> 00:46:15,430
for troops that are showing up we love

810
00:46:15,430 --> 00:46:18,819
all the friends that were making if
you've seen any other group here that

811
00:46:18,819 --> 00:46:20,130
aren't even tall

812
00:46:20,130 --> 00:46:23,810
go by say hi see what they do see where
they'll be maybe they're visiting

813
00:46:23,810 --> 00:46:28,380
another con near you we do say that you
know tool is the only nonprofit

814
00:46:28,380 --> 00:46:32,250
in the scene as far as we know tool we
make our own equipment we just we put

815
00:46:32,250 --> 00:46:34,380
all anything we get just just back into
the

816
00:46:34,380 --> 00:46:38,089
no into the organization because we want
people to try this we want people have

817
00:46:38,089 --> 00:46:39,349
fun with this

818
00:46:39,349 --> 00:46:42,950
so if how many people think they might
write this alright

819
00:46:42,950 --> 00:46:46,200
I'm gonna have to cut some more starter
keys

820
00:46:46,200 --> 00:46:50,500
is only about five per lock but you know
I'll start working at alter code tonight

821
00:46:50,500 --> 00:46:53,810
we're setting this all up tomorrow we
don't want any locks out at night

822
00:46:53,810 --> 00:46:56,549
because even though ya look pretty
trustworthy

823
00:46:56,550 --> 00:46:59,670
I don't want anyone back in the locks
apart reading the pens and and she never

824
00:46:59,670 --> 00:47:00,140
went out

825
00:47:00,140 --> 00:47:04,450
I want this first time that we ever you
know have our game vesco interaction

826
00:47:04,450 --> 00:47:07,680
to be really really good and a work well

827
00:47:07,680 --> 00:47:10,879
alright old Nintendo players get the
title reference

828
00:47:10,880 --> 00:47:15,319
yeah so I I hope this will be fun maybe
it'll be a giant train wreck but I think

829
00:47:15,319 --> 00:47:18,589
everyone hears polite enough to try to
not just brute force in

830
00:47:18,589 --> 00:47:22,349
I mean dodges damage force anything
please be respectful to everyone else

831
00:47:22,349 --> 00:47:23,920
who wants to play the game

832
00:47:23,920 --> 00:47:27,599
and we'll see how this goes other than
that will be downstairs in the village

833
00:47:27,599 --> 00:47:29,400
all day tomorrow all day on Sunday

834
00:47:29,400 --> 00:47:33,109
Rays gonna be down there after his cuff
talk he's gonna give lessons and I

835
00:47:33,109 --> 00:47:34,319
appreciate you listened

836
00:47:34,319 --> 00:47:40,670
thank you so much

837
00:47:40,670 --> 00:47:45,540
question is what times starting will
call at noon

838
00:47:45,540 --> 00:47:48,869
no bumping is the question that is
correct please no bumping although I

839
00:47:48,869 --> 00:47:50,160
like bumping

840
00:47:50,160 --> 00:47:53,480
I get would damage looks good enough to
learn anything

841
00:47:53,480 --> 00:47:57,260
you know all I got bumped it awesome
what are the values they're not all nine

842
00:47:57,260 --> 00:48:00,819
of a tie right now

843
00:48:00,819 --> 00:48:05,200
any other yes

844
00:48:05,200 --> 00:48:07,740
I think they want to hear I'll repeat
but if you wanna come up though they

845
00:48:07,740 --> 00:48:09,950
like it when you use the mic

846
00:48:09,950 --> 00:48:14,400
that also helps them graduate engage in
a who's waiting for for questions

847
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:17,630
it's not gonna wait not gone

848
00:48:17,630 --> 00:48:23,170
little more maybe either you are the
right plan to start to stir

849
00:48:23,170 --> 00:48:26,210
keep talking into it will save the mic
level comes up in and I can hear you

850
00:48:26,210 --> 00:48:26,890
know

851
00:48:26,890 --> 00:48:32,609
I can hear you just get up

852
00:48:32,609 --> 00:48:35,869
yes so the question is about Max MECs

853
00:48:35,869 --> 00:48:40,180
or what is that exactly going on there
again as I say it's not usually a

854
00:48:40,180 --> 00:48:41,089
concern to people

855
00:48:41,089 --> 00:48:44,520
outside the exact field locksmithing but
Max

856
00:48:44,520 --> 00:48:50,000
or maximum adjacent cut specification is
the maximum possible differential

857
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:53,150
between two values a bidding on a key or

858
00:48:53,150 --> 00:48:56,490
in a lock in chambers right next one
another

859
00:48:56,490 --> 00:48:59,890
max values have to be not completely
different

860
00:48:59,890 --> 00:49:03,509
because i've a couple reasons primarily
imagine

861
00:49:03,510 --> 00:49:07,760
if you know a really tall cut really you
know topping appear really deep cut here

862
00:49:07,760 --> 00:49:10,839
were right next to one another the key

863
00:49:10,839 --> 00:49:14,849
well either be produced one of two ways:
a key being produced by a fixed wheel

864
00:49:14,849 --> 00:49:16,619
you know notched cutting blade bill

865
00:49:16,619 --> 00:49:20,369
lamp lamb lamb for the nice broad here
big V

866
00:49:20,369 --> 00:49:24,910
well this deep cut is gonna start
colliding into the space over here that

867
00:49:24,910 --> 00:49:25,848
would possibly

868
00:49:25,849 --> 00:49:29,310
not even make this cut possible in the
cut is gone or

869
00:49:29,310 --> 00:49:34,540
if you narrowed up that be so that you
could have like a to next to an 8

870
00:49:34,540 --> 00:49:38,069
well now you've got such a deep canyon
wall that you run into that problem

871
00:49:38,069 --> 00:49:42,099
trapping or canyoning now that's
avoidable to some degree

872
00:49:42,099 --> 00:49:45,790
by having pins that are that are made
plans that have a nice sharp tip that'll

873
00:49:45,790 --> 00:49:47,290
help to ride in an out

874
00:49:47,290 --> 00:49:51,050
that's why Schley clocks for example the
second most common lock in the US

875
00:49:51,050 --> 00:49:54,250
shoelace have a higher max differential
is permissible

876
00:49:54,250 --> 00:49:57,660
then click Set quick sets and many other
clones

877
00:49:57,660 --> 00:50:00,990
are made with pins that are just a
little more rounded its easier on the

878
00:50:00,990 --> 00:50:03,940
operator it's less likely to have
fouling errors and things

879
00:50:03,940 --> 00:50:07,690
but it does reduce your your Mac's
potential doesn't mean that you can't

880
00:50:07,690 --> 00:50:09,430
get a key in and out

881
00:50:09,430 --> 00:50:13,578
it doesn't mean that if your hand filing
you might not have a really narrow ledge

882
00:50:13,579 --> 00:50:16,859
for where your PIN supposed to say it
but it still kinda there but its

883
00:50:16,859 --> 00:50:20,859
in the real world in its not a good idea
to build a system that violates max does

884
00:50:20,859 --> 00:50:22,430
that make it a little clearer

885
00:50:22,430 --> 00:50:25,529
excellent anyone else

886
00:50:25,530 --> 00:50:29,880
yes sir and then you

887
00:50:29,880 --> 00:50:33,550
the question is are we going to sell
blanks yet likes her book

888
00:50:33,550 --> 00:50:37,460
we pass the savings on to you because
cheaper than Home Depot we got in from a

889
00:50:37,460 --> 00:50:41,240
again hopefully those have been
delivered by pro locker somebody wearing

890
00:50:41,240 --> 00:50:43,750
I'm gonna go run down to that desk
before they

891
00:50:43,750 --> 00:50:47,460
the how how long the line is is this
just you know is the line 22 those

892
00:50:47,460 --> 00:50:50,480
people actually stay here is that it or
something in New York like

893
00:50:50,480 --> 00:50:54,540
come see the line at Hotel pens lobbying

931
00:52:56,450 --> 00:52:59,700
acid I the only thing that sucks about
it

932
00:52:59,700 --> 00:53:04,090
is it has shipped punctuation so like
those slashes

933
00:53:04,090 --> 00:53:07,420
are not acid I had like format them in a
different font and this is a weird

934
00:53:07,420 --> 00:53:08,690
spacings other like

935
00:53:08,690 --> 00:53:12,090

fun little John T

939
00:53:21,240 --> 00:53:24,500
thing and then acid is the thing we use
all of our presentations

940
00:53:24,500 --> 00:53:27,780
very cold you know you don't often get a
typography question like that that's

more question no there wasn't

946
00:53:44,330 --> 00:53:49,850
as making a break only people saw this
man once again began to rate

947
00:53:49,850 --> 00:53:56,850
I'll repeat

948
00:53:58,390 --> 00:54:04,350

949
00:54:04,350 --> 00:54:08,970

950
00:54:08,970 --> 00:54:13,140
yes all really

951
00:54:13,140 --> 00:54:17,850
that all-race pointing out

952
00:54:17,850 --> 00:54:21,750
Solis raised during his workshop at the
top of the hour 8 minutes

953
00:54:21,750 --> 00:54:25,750
race from space for the district technic

954
00:54:25,750 --> 00:54:26,860
I just murdered that one

955
00:54:26,860 --> 00:54:31,140
but yes ray from SS dev they made that
setup key that that

956
00:54:31,140 --> 00:54:35,100
key for the MCs and they said it
actually really fun to try to decode

957
00:54:35,100 --> 00:54:38,270
master key to know systems cuz you can
just rotate the magnets

958
00:54:38,270 --> 00:54:42,580
on the key that's pretty badass if that
would be a little above their pay grade

959
00:54:42,580 --> 00:54:45,130
for a contest that maybe we'll do that
to the next luck on

960
00:54:45,130 --> 00:54:49,880
I think I think we're getting the light
