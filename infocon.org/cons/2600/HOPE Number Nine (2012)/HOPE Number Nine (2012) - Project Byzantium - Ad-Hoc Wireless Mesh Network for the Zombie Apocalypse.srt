1
00:00:01,319 --> 00:00:03,230
Bay is everyone having the conference

2
00:00:03,230 --> 00:00:08,800
then her and her back happens here again
did you guys have had a conference

3
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:11,920
could core alright

4
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:16,190
Wellemeyer yet these guys have the
required just read through their

5
00:00:16,190 --> 00:00:17,750
products and him

6
00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:19,620
description in the program now

7
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:23,510
the seem logical people around so we're
class tonight the introduction

8
00:00:23,510 --> 00:00:30,510
and juror when career

9
00:00:32,439 --> 00:00:37,160
movement and that's a good question good
evening everyone

10
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:40,890
I am welcome to hope welcome to project
present him

11
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:46,500
mesh networking for zombie apocalypse
still like them

12
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:49,730
yeah home there the house which

13
00:00:49,730 --> 00:00:53,250
while plugged I

14
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:58,489
wanna on in different ways back it on
its own

15
00:00:58,489 --> 00:01:02,450
100 just you stop your work

16
00:01:02,450 --> 00:01:07,509
we discussed right about here is not a
big deal okay

17
00:01:07,509 --> 00:01:10,979
was just burst into flames Arabia that
I'm

18
00:01:10,979 --> 00:01:15,009
there first lady first nice to have a
short disclaimer

19
00:01:15,009 --> 00:01:18,640
president commercial disclaimer

20
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:22,990
are we not done not be present when the
best speak for employers Kaster

21
00:01:22,990 --> 00:01:23,530
President

22
00:01:23,530 --> 00:01:26,880
I wanna we also are not speaking for
happy see either

23
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:30,729
our members have had been seeing arm up

24
00:01:30,729 --> 00:01:33,880
you know how it goes with organizations
and buy one C threes and things like

25
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:34,220
that

26
00:01:34,220 --> 00:01:38,220
on we'd also like to talk to you state
that project by the ATM

27
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:41,890
is entirely separate from our day
evening in other jobs we're doing this I

28
00:01:41,890 --> 00:01:42,729
spare time

29
00:01:42,729 --> 00:01:46,520
get same standard disclaimer yeah so who
we are

30
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:50,098
I'm obviously and the pirate I'll see
myself on

31
00:01:50,099 --> 00:01:53,250
triangle I Lexus admin developer

32
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:56,800
experience with networks in bed
distributions arm

33
00:01:56,800 --> 00:02:00,459
and yeah I'm really concerned about I
never hit reality

34
00:02:00,459 --> 00:02:04,020
disaster relief I things like Egypt
Haiti

35
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:07,920
I that you know what happens when

36
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:12,830
people can't communicate I'm hatchbacks

37
00:02:12,830 --> 00:02:17,690
I am Linux sysadmin program do wanna
stop do

38
00:02:17,690 --> 00:02:21,079
outdoorsy stuff I'm a great thanks and

39
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:26,530
to learn how to fix them unfortunately
here and I'm call the doctor

40
00:02:26,530 --> 00:02:30,629
on Twitter I am very adept I am AB RH bi
trade

41
00:02:30,629 --> 00:02:35,000
I am also a system architect a security
consultant in a social activist

42
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,610
on my experience with alternative
communications technologies

43
00:02:38,610 --> 00:02:42,129
and I'm concerned about censorship
emergency communications

44
00:02:42,129 --> 00:02:46,328
and freedom of speech it's a missing
sanctions

45
00:02:46,329 --> 00:02:50,049
they're making an eight-year basically
that you have a net plus

46
00:02:50,049 --> 00:02:53,730
Oracle and understanding and networking
if you're at the office I'm at all

47
00:02:53,730 --> 00:02:56,909
in 1811 you know how crowding works

48
00:02:56,909 --> 00:03:01,719
its pretty standard stop by think for
most people at this kinda conference

49
00:03:01,719 --> 00:03:06,579
so our fundamental assumption is this

50
00:03:06,579 --> 00:03:11,159
the Internet is broken if there was a
lot of different levels but let's start

51
00:03:11,159 --> 00:03:12,670
at the bottom

52
00:03:12,670 --> 00:03:15,870
great so the first use cases

53
00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:19,739
you know the Katrina problem which is a
massive failure infrastructure

54
00:03:19,739 --> 00:03:23,659
some kind of natural disaster or zombie
apocalypse comes in

55
00:03:23,659 --> 00:03:27,659
and the phone lines are all down the
ISP's aren't functioning

56
00:03:27,659 --> 00:03:33,200
there might be no no power limited power
so this is where like there's no lines

57
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:36,409
connecting you physically to anybody
else

58
00:03:36,409 --> 00:03:43,349
and that can be a problem a second use
case we call the injured problem

59
00:03:43,349 --> 00:03:46,549
its whenever they deliver compromise are
the network infrastructure

60
00:03:46,549 --> 00:03:49,829
for example when I S p's are taken
offline um

61
00:03:49,829 --> 00:03:52,730
in this situation you need to
communicate with other people in a

62
00:03:52,730 --> 00:03:53,719
secure manner

63
00:03:53,719 --> 00:03:57,489
I need to contact the outside world to
send and receive information

64
00:03:57,489 --> 00:04:00,879
and often there is an active member say
working against you in fact by

65
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:01,909
definition there is

66
00:04:01,909 --> 00:04:06,689
so our approach to solving these
problems

67
00:04:06,689 --> 00:04:10,388
is a construction other more about ad
hoc wireless network

68
00:04:10,389 --> 00:04:14,060
blog Muniz

69
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:18,389
centralized network doesn't interpret
censorship is damaging wrapped around it

70
00:04:18,389 --> 00:04:21,920
not so much death

71
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:25,500
so the problem is that the eye you know
the IP addressing

72
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:29,350
ipv4 and ipv6 are inherently a
hierarchical

73
00:04:29,350 --> 00:04:33,650
ended determines your address determines
where you exist

74
00:04:33,650 --> 00:04:38,370
logically hierarchically within that
network so it's a location inside the

75
00:04:38,370 --> 00:04:38,919
network

76
00:04:38,919 --> 00:04:42,310
and packets get routed are based on this
hierarchy

77
00:04:42,310 --> 00:04:46,940
n there's really no a lot on our son
have redundant links there's only like

78
00:04:46,940 --> 00:04:50,440
one potential route to take to get a
typical jet does nation

79
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:54,900
if that route happens to go down then
does nations completely unreachable

80
00:04:54,900 --> 00:05:01,099
so to solve this problem what we need is
a true mesh network

81
00:05:01,099 --> 00:05:06,610
with what we gonna routes between
endpoints so it's got us all together

82
00:05:06,610 --> 00:05:10,710
and not let us was measuring it well
people's but our ad hoc wireless mesh

83
00:05:10,710 --> 00:05:11,270
network

84
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:14,719
and you can already do this such as been
around for a long time

85
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:17,910
yet the technology mesh network has
existed for well over 20 years

86
00:05:17,910 --> 00:05:21,539
the thing is nobody has made it easy to
deploy though he has made it

87
00:05:21,539 --> 00:05:24,870
easy to verify its working now he has
made it reliable

88
00:05:24,870 --> 00:05:31,199
and we're trying to fix that sewer
design was going into this was that has

89
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:32,050
to be cheap

90
00:05:32,050 --> 00:05:35,530
and use readily available equipment
because when shit hits the fan

91
00:05:35,530 --> 00:05:39,259
you can go out to Newegg you can got to
like Mauser you're gonna have to make do

92
00:05:39,259 --> 00:05:40,430
with what you have

93
00:05:40,430 --> 00:05:44,400
you know knew I can deliver if you can
get online to order it

94
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:47,490
our mission it's gotta be rapidly
deployable because

95
00:05:47,490 --> 00:05:51,210
this is an emergency situation it's
gotta be you know extensible to the

96
00:05:51,210 --> 00:05:53,229
problem solve the problem you're having

97
00:05:53,229 --> 00:05:57,370
it needs to be reliable because people's
lives can depend on it

98
00:05:57,370 --> 00:06:00,789
and needs to be secure for the same
reason any three little mean it's cuz

99
00:06:00,789 --> 00:06:03,068
kinda people that have the skills to set
this up

100
00:06:03,069 --> 00:06:06,560
have other valuable skills and they're
gonna be needed elsewhere to you

101
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:10,220
you know continue solving problems K

102
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:13,780
cell cycle but a better design
constraints I would sign the song

103
00:06:13,780 --> 00:06:15,009
between a public purse

104
00:06:15,009 --> 00:06:18,680
immediate problem second because the
added problem is actually

105
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:22,530
a specialization between a problem arm
to solve this

106
00:06:22,530 --> 00:06:27,240
we need we need a solution which a small
group are minimally skilled individuals

107
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:31,409
can deploy to solve this problem ideally
wanna make it is easy to use

108
00:06:31,409 --> 00:06:35,780
as say setting up a home wireless router
right out of the box

109
00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:40,169
arm the print is the solution also needs
to support a large community abusers

110
00:06:40,169 --> 00:06:43,770
it's not just for geeks it's not just
for hackers it has to be four

111
00:06:43,770 --> 00:06:47,049
whoever has a wireless a quick device

112
00:06:47,050 --> 00:06:51,020
and has a need to communicate we present
a communique

113
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:54,180
arms officials have to be available in
the solution to accomplish arbitrate

114
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:55,009
asks

115
00:06:55,009 --> 00:06:58,129
because let's face it no plans rise
first contact with the enemy

116
00:06:58,129 --> 00:07:01,250
and whenever shaver for me wanna put
that in

117
00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:04,819
also minimal collusion is be required in
an emergency situation where

118
00:07:04,819 --> 00:07:06,349
communication is critical

119
00:07:06,349 --> 00:07:09,400
you don't have time to run around
finding her

120
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:12,729
finding people figuring out who knows
what they're doing who doesn't have the

121
00:07:12,729 --> 00:07:14,199
skill set

122
00:07:14,199 --> 00:07:17,759
yet you need to be able to startup get
it running and then

123
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:21,189
hit the ground running and then take off
to do other things this is a tool to

124
00:07:21,189 --> 00:07:22,819
restore communications so

125
00:07:22,819 --> 00:07:25,430
we're making the assumption that you
can't already communicate with the

126
00:07:25,430 --> 00:07:27,039
people that you want to

127
00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:31,960
otherwise you don't need this another
design constraint is not on the clock

128
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:36,120
not all the devices in the field have to
be running the measuring software

129
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:41,590
arm this press opposes that you're not
good have access to the iTunes Store

130
00:07:41,590 --> 00:07:44,860
America have access to Android play on
you might jet

131
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:49,060
you might have a netbook sitting on a
shelf you might happen or PC with a

132
00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:50,180
wireless card sitting

133
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:56,800
in your basement or you might just have
a smart phone or mp3 player on

134
00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:00,490
great so really hasn't happened

135
00:08:00,490 --> 00:08:04,020
ad hoc networking so we're using it
until 11 a player one

136
00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:07,948
on Ren and where to you were using ad
hoc networking which is part of the

137
00:08:07,949 --> 00:08:09,310
united on spec

138
00:08:09,310 --> 00:08:14,199
arm most 802 died 11 devices most white
WiFi enabled by supporting

139
00:08:14,199 --> 00:08:17,449
are not many people know about it or use
it for some reason

140
00:08:17,449 --> 00:08:20,610
I'm sure a lot of you did by average
people don't

141
00:08:20,610 --> 00:08:25,039
and arm there are some devices that have
trouble with it

142
00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:29,400
on it requires minimal configuration
there's no central EP needed

143
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:33,169
what happens arm if you look on at the
image on the

144
00:08:33,169 --> 00:08:37,500
left what happens in a standard access
point network is that the clients talked

145
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:38,419
to the AP

146
00:08:38,419 --> 00:08:42,789
only even if they're right next to each
other unit that radios are like

147
00:08:42,789 --> 00:08:46,300
literally six inches apart and messages
go up to the AP

148
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:49,630
and then back down to the other client
and

149
00:08:49,630 --> 00:08:52,900
they can't they can talk directly to
each other in an ad hoc network

150
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:56,290
there is no AP they all just part and
whoever can hear them

151
00:08:56,290 --> 00:08:59,939
hears them are the problem is that it
doesn't implement multi-hop so if the

152
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:01,480
note is a little bit further away

153
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:05,040
unit their nodes in the middle they
won't route that traffic automatically

154
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:06,060
earlier to

155
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:09,540
are so that a mesh routing comes in to
solve that

156
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:13,219
mesh running happens at Lear 3 and it
solves the

157
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:16,910
multi-hop problem an ad hoc networking

158
00:09:16,910 --> 00:09:20,360
came arm as I said earlier mesh routing
has been a

159
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:23,610
had but it has existed as a technology
for well over 20 years

160
00:09:23,610 --> 00:09:27,730
and number cause I just implement
measuring in binary meaner

161
00:09:27,730 --> 00:09:31,460
over 70 of them back in nineteen
nineties measure networking was actually

162
00:09:31,460 --> 00:09:35,130
something a hot topic research where
somebody would publish a paper

163
00:09:35,130 --> 00:09:38,760
maybe there'll be a simple code and then
that was in a bit

164
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:43,170
Ste armed is also the problem that not
almost ready for calls

165
00:09:43,170 --> 00:09:47,360
have the same features they also don't
have all the same problems

166
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:51,250
singularly generalize a solution from
them in fact some

167
00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:54,580
back not over measuring protocols are
we've been equally efficient were

168
00:09:54,580 --> 00:09:55,960
compared to another

169
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:58,990
and some have some very serious flaws
which make the moneys worth one reason

170
00:09:58,990 --> 00:10:00,590
or another

171
00:10:00,590 --> 00:10:04,070
great see a value-added narrower than
the first one was open a telling us

172
00:10:04,070 --> 00:10:04,920
which

173
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:08,229
it's the standard so you think well
that's the obvious choice

174
00:10:08,230 --> 00:10:11,290
accepted isn't

175
00:10:11,290 --> 00:10:14,870
so the software yeah this is is a
standard

176
00:10:14,870 --> 00:10:18,270
that its point in taking only recently
become standard arm

177
00:10:18,270 --> 00:10:22,210
it's supposed to be implemented into the
farm where in a 211

178
00:10:22,210 --> 00:10:26,820
devices drivers arm it is build your
support is built on lies in the st. but

179
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:27,870
only where the hardware

180
00:10:27,870 --> 00:10:32,150
supports it on it requires you know some

181
00:10:32,150 --> 00:10:36,230
are I mean it requires like some deep
knowledge to use

182
00:10:36,230 --> 00:10:39,700
its kinda exotic still not well
implemented there's

183
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:43,090
your compatibility problems between
different versions of it

184
00:10:43,090 --> 00:10:46,760
and you know its release not why these

185
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:49,660
the second protocol we looked at is
called the well as our which stands for

186
00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:51,180
optimized link-state routing

187
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:54,320
as name suggests its a link-state
routing protocol which is largely

188
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,320
agnostic

189
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:58,780
it actually creates 802 11 so it can be
run

190
00:10:58,780 --> 00:11:02,439
on pretty much any network any kind they
were thrown out

191
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:05,690
I'm unfortunately OLSR doesn't deal in
quality awareness

192
00:11:05,690 --> 00:11:09,390
there are a few implementations the
protocol that have it but

193
00:11:09,390 --> 00:11:12,880
at best is its experimental so in

194
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:17,380
weird Wales directly environments
transmission transients are a

195
00:11:17,380 --> 00:11:20,439
can lead to links being a little bit
dodgy analysts are as an able to

196
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:22,240
compensate for that

197
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:26,200
also they've just started implementing
proactively protection

198
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:29,670
its experimental and how well it works

199
00:11:29,670 --> 00:11:32,920
and how many situations that works in
remains to be seen

200
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:36,829
well as our is also very chatty I'd
leads the entire network with the policy

201
00:11:36,830 --> 00:11:37,980
information

202
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:41,370
so we have a certain so at a certain
network density

203
00:11:41,370 --> 00:11:44,450
and or certain number of nodes are you
may wind up seeing

204
00:11:44,450 --> 00:11:50,030
more reading traffic being exchanged
numbers than other forms of traffic

205
00:11:50,030 --> 00:11:54,079
the second like that was Batman vans
which is being used by the free from

206
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:54,630
network

207
00:11:54,630 --> 00:11:58,920
and its under a very active element is
an active community around it

208
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:02,370
I it seems a better approach to mobile
ad hoc networking

209
00:12:02,370 --> 00:12:05,520
on it does happen call the awareness it
does have

210
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:10,210
leap away tents arm it's been in the
UN's karnal officially sense 2.6 points

211
00:12:10,210 --> 00:12:11,140
38

212
00:12:11,140 --> 00:12:15,380
are before that it was in testings again
earlier kinda you might still have it

213
00:12:15,380 --> 00:12:18,880
the problem is that in its I

214
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:22,880
it requires that each kill utility which
most distributions do not include do not

215
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:23,680
package

216
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:27,250
you have to get it from a third party
dollar doll the sourcing compile it

217
00:12:27,250 --> 00:12:30,870
often if it is in your I in your
judgment repository

218
00:12:30,870 --> 00:12:34,190
version utilities out-of-date with the
persian your kernel

219
00:12:34,190 --> 00:12:39,160
harm its and it doesn't in our testing
in mind it's all too rapid deployment

220
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:42,959
it weighs really difficult to you are
managing test

221
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:47,170
partially because it operates a layer 3
but provides

222
00:12:47,170 --> 00:12:51,740
virtual layer 2 interface so you can't
use irregular layer 3 tools to diagnose

223
00:12:51,740 --> 00:12:53,000
the operation

224
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,040
and troubleshoot you have to use special
tools written for

225
00:12:56,040 --> 00:13:00,040
the Batman software to you you know poke
around and see if it's working

226
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:04,740
see what's going on even TCP to biz trip
to bet against

227
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:08,770
with a bit of a surprise so after a
couple cycles of testing in a

228
00:13:08,770 --> 00:13:12,069
in our development spend we settled on a
No

229
00:13:12,070 --> 00:13:16,150
on a mission critical about it it is a
distance vector routing protocol

230
00:13:16,150 --> 00:13:19,650
which uses among other things limp body
to help determine the optimal

231
00:13:19,650 --> 00:13:24,480
an optimal route to the mash it is
traffic density aware so if a mission

232
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:25,100
owed

233
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:28,540
has several interfaces and went through
the interfaces are very heavily

234
00:13:28,540 --> 00:13:29,500
trafficked

235
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:33,880
but 30 interface is not then it'll make
the decision to read more traffic over

236
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:35,510
the least use interface

237
00:13:35,510 --> 00:13:38,900
which may give it a longer with making a
longer path through the network

238
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:42,610
but will in the end wind up being more
efficient

239
00:13:42,610 --> 00:13:46,550
battle also unusually converges rapidly
by rapidly it'll

240
00:13:46,550 --> 00:13:50,320
a mess can converge in about four
seconds yet as proactive

241
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:55,460
loop avoidance that formally proven this
was start as an academic projects so

242
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:59,160
its that this is actually mathematically
proven as a proof on Office website

243
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:02,410
you can read about it if you're
interested and you know and I'll be

244
00:14:02,410 --> 00:14:05,050
twins properties which are actually can
call

245
00:14:05,050 --> 00:14:08,690
and your search on mesh networking now
or you'll find the page

246
00:14:08,690 --> 00:14:12,700
I'm gonna butcher the gentleman's name
horribly and iPod residence

247
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:15,870
Juliska branch I believe yeah again

248
00:14:15,870 --> 00:14:19,240
Julius if you're watching this i
apologize. I'm

249
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:23,010
battle also runs in userspace so

250
00:14:23,010 --> 00:14:26,790
it lends itself to portability in the
playability it doesn't run as occur much

251
00:14:26,790 --> 00:14:28,400
orders resumes driver

252
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:32,430
are you start up on the command line and
it takes off on its own

253
00:14:32,430 --> 00:14:36,530
it also manages the reading table the
operating systems kernel rather than

254
00:14:36,530 --> 00:14:40,600
setting up its own writing table
structure or looking into what exists

255
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:43,820
basically it automates the process and
doing

256
00:14:43,820 --> 00:14:47,540
route Adro del yada yada yada and a

257
00:14:47,540 --> 00:14:51,410
very scheme in fashion so it's really
easy to check on it by just you know

258
00:14:51,410 --> 00:14:55,290
using regular tools reunion tools to see
on how it's working

259
00:14:55,290 --> 00:15:00,579
and up ground in their punitive Thompson
breezy configure and most it's like four

260
00:15:00,580 --> 00:15:01,260
lines in the

261
00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:04,510
a configuration file this was really
really

262
00:15:04,510 --> 00:15:08,069
easy yeah and the nice thing is the
following configuration file

263
00:15:08,070 --> 00:15:11,880
yeah has been portable across every
situation with your network com

264
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:17,600
it leads it generalizes very easily to
lots of different problems

265
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:20,850
so question we get asked a lot is what
about war

266
00:15:20,850 --> 00:15:23,870
what about cjd in as it. /p all these
other solutions

267
00:15:23,870 --> 00:15:28,480
aren't they mesh networks can't we just
use that CD especially keeps coming up

268
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:35,330
arm and South not quite they are
low-level enough

269
00:15:35,330 --> 00:15:38,770
at yes the catheter now with him

270
00:15:38,770 --> 00:15:42,710
I'm so they all operate at less I wear
for

271
00:15:42,710 --> 00:15:46,720
and above so if you don't have routing
worked out at the network layer

272
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:50,670
their three then you're still dead in
the water CJ DNS even isn't that's not a

273
00:15:50,670 --> 00:15:51,710
replacement for this

274
00:15:51,710 --> 00:15:55,020
does what it says you know about you
know throwing out the US I model

275
00:15:55,020 --> 00:15:58,050
it doesn't its or its allies on the
three below

276
00:15:58,050 --> 00:16:01,840
to operate if you can send packets you
know over the IP network

277
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:05,380
then it's not going to do anything you
know how it takes is one man

278
00:16:05,380 --> 00:16:08,780
is when DPI Harbor manufactured after a
couple rolls and

279
00:16:08,780 --> 00:16:12,310
which has a turnaround time sometimes
have seconds

280
00:16:12,310 --> 00:16:15,390
and your solution is dead in the water

281
00:16:15,390 --> 00:16:19,120
so aren't so the solution to kill if you
know your eyes he's using

282
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:22,540
DPI filtering for sports or stop
sprouting and so

283
00:16:22,540 --> 00:16:26,079
reiteration of the instruction tirely
which has been happening more and more

284
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:26,700
often

285
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:30,650
Syria great so ad hoc networks provide
you with a solid you know

286
00:16:30,650 --> 00:16:33,930
layer 3 that you can use these tools on
top of him we do recommend them

287
00:16:33,930 --> 00:16:37,620
on they solve different problems than
Dwight match routing sauce

288
00:16:37,620 --> 00:16:42,320
and they are valuable and with that
relate to announce the release

289
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:46,350
presented 1x version 2.0 alpha

290
00:16:46,350 --> 00:16:53,350
where he was pronounced

291
00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:58,100
misspelled word

292
00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:01,890
no 0.2 this is an alpha release yes
against the

293
00:17:01,890 --> 00:17:05,660
data I got a question 0.2 help

294
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:08,929
sorry yeah working on it heavily

295
00:17:08,929 --> 00:17:12,260
yet we're doing our best and we will get
there yes within sight

296
00:17:12,260 --> 00:17:17,020
on is as well live CD I live usb
distribution it's based on

297
00:17:17,020 --> 00:17:21,910
protests 1x arm it has utilities for
live replication feel which

298
00:17:21,910 --> 00:17:25,490
was really why we went with this its
super easy to make copies

299
00:17:25,490 --> 00:17:29,080
even from just a running up you have
plug in USB run a script

300
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:33,649
and you have another one I it has all
the mesh routing software are you

301
00:17:33,649 --> 00:17:34,779
install on it

302
00:17:34,779 --> 00:17:38,850
and has you know tools for development
debugging see can play around with it

303
00:17:38,850 --> 00:17:42,620
weep through a LAMP stack on their see
can host applications locally in the

304
00:17:42,620 --> 00:17:44,700
case and there is no internet access

305
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:47,809
I there's a web control panel for
administering it

306
00:17:47,809 --> 00:17:52,450
similar to you administering out you
know wireless router in your own

307
00:17:52,450 --> 00:17:55,629
and we have also included a couple more
proof of concept visa services

308
00:17:55,629 --> 00:17:58,809
which you can run on a mesh node will be
available to miss users

309
00:17:58,809 --> 00:18:02,379
among them we have included and iris the
server with a web client

310
00:18:02,379 --> 00:18:06,169
we ship we're trying to optimize for
mobile devices and the collaborative

311
00:18:06,169 --> 00:18:07,299
text editor

312
00:18:07,299 --> 00:18:12,149
gays are bad so we need to talk a little
bit about some other problems we ran

313
00:18:12,149 --> 00:18:13,370
into and how we solve them

314
00:18:13,370 --> 00:18:17,620
the first was network configuration I
emergency situation in a particular with

315
00:18:17,620 --> 00:18:20,159
mesh networks you have something a
chicken-and-egg problem

316
00:18:20,159 --> 00:18:25,110
on you're putting up a node and but you
can be sure you're the only node

317
00:18:25,110 --> 00:18:28,610
are you might be but you have no way of
knowing have time if you are

318
00:18:28,610 --> 00:18:32,340
on the other hand you might be putting
up a note and you don't know if there's

319
00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:33,870
already a mesh network to connect to

320
00:18:33,870 --> 00:18:37,000
so the question is how you can be
yourself without either

321
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,710
without stepping on your neighbors but
also how you make it possible to

322
00:18:39,710 --> 00:18:41,200
bootstrap mash

323
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:46,179
in the head and what we came up with is
a probe and test algorithm

324
00:18:46,179 --> 00:18:50,919
which unfortunately in accidentally
really implements

325
00:18:50,919 --> 00:18:54,149
about he's are gone what we did was

326
00:18:54,149 --> 00:18:58,299
our control panel uses are playing to
detect whether or not

327
00:18:58,299 --> 00:19:03,029
and scenery and IP addresses in the RFC
1918 dress pace

328
00:19:03,029 --> 00:19:06,110
192 168 struck 16 exist

329
00:19:06,110 --> 00:19:10,600
and if Id if another server has claimed
that then it'll send back in our packet

330
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:15,240
if it doesn't work limit for itself i'd
then assigns addressed to its primary

331
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:16,210
wireless interface

332
00:19:16,210 --> 00:19:20,870
as a slash 32 so every link the techie
everybody know that connects to

333
00:19:20,870 --> 00:19:24,889
is basically up point to point rout we
do the same thing for clients

334
00:19:24,889 --> 00:19:29,419
only in the temple me in the eye tens
for 24 address space

335
00:19:29,419 --> 00:19:33,149
we implement DNS and DHCP for the
clients with DNS mask

336
00:19:33,149 --> 00:19:36,379
add significant figure by the control
panel just after it

337
00:19:36,379 --> 00:19:41,509
giving as well as a defense and we also
found a workaround for the problem only

338
00:19:41,509 --> 00:19:43,730
having one wireless interface

339
00:19:43,730 --> 00:19:49,559
arm what we do is after the primary well
as interfaces configured on a node

340
00:19:49,559 --> 00:19:52,980
it then tries to detect if there is a
second miles interface

341
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:56,889
if there isn't it sets up a wire it sets
up an IP alias on the wireless interface

342
00:19:56,889 --> 00:20:00,700
so that binds the UN 0 it creates a
feeling is your cold one

343
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:05,039
and the billions your call one is the
virtual interface that the clients

344
00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:10,149
communicate with and because they're
basically the same physical place

345
00:20:10,149 --> 00:20:14,429
traffic goes and comes out and you don't
have to do anything crazy it just does

346
00:20:14,429 --> 00:20:15,649
the right thing

347
00:20:15,649 --> 00:20:19,759
happens that happen he says yeah yes
when we went actually implemented by E

348
00:20:19,759 --> 00:20:23,639
reno said that no configuration part are
actually we have 10 of

349
00:20:23,639 --> 00:20:27,509
and that was like group so inexplicable
probably just use your comp for that

350
00:20:27,509 --> 00:20:28,249
part

351
00:20:28,249 --> 00:20:33,149
your so I'm great so like what he said
about the client's

352
00:20:33,149 --> 00:20:36,210
arm in I in a mesh network

353
00:20:36,210 --> 00:20:39,730
you have nodes but we're also it has
been in the clients are

354
00:20:39,730 --> 00:20:43,360
running the National of where so how we
deal with those

355
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:48,159
are the pomegranate their is our logo
for Byzantium so that represents

356
00:20:48,159 --> 00:20:53,379
you know Byzantine node arm and has the
WN 0n WN 0 column 1

357
00:20:53,379 --> 00:20:58,259
interface the UN's your interface is has
that slashed 32 address

358
00:20:58,259 --> 00:21:01,499
and talking to the other nodes in the
mesh network

359
00:21:01,499 --> 00:21:04,590
and the corn one has that Tendai
slotched

360
00:21:04,590 --> 00:21:08,809
24 dress and it's talking to you non
matched by sits on a non nationalize

361
00:21:08,809 --> 00:21:13,249
comes on the ad hoc network its gonna
use DHCP to ask for an IP address

362
00:21:13,249 --> 00:21:16,490
you know just like you go to Starbucks
in connect the Internet and

363
00:21:16,490 --> 00:21:20,220
what's gonna happen is the closest no to
you is you know usually is gonna

364
00:21:20,220 --> 00:21:24,149
reply first with and IP address and then
it's can become your gateway

365
00:21:24,149 --> 00:21:28,499
to the rest the National work so to
regular user their connecting

366
00:21:28,499 --> 00:21:32,879
to you and 2i hot spot just like in
Starbucks and just look at Starbucks

367
00:21:32,879 --> 00:21:37,149
you need a captive portal page you know
telling you hey you're on a mesh network

368
00:21:37,149 --> 00:21:40,200
these are the kind the services are
available available watch out

369
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:44,019
it might not be secure arm and so we can
allow

370
00:21:44,019 --> 00:21:47,850
devices like phones I you know bottom
running software

371
00:21:47,850 --> 00:21:50,919
up computers anything else that's out
there that's why fine abled

372
00:21:50,919 --> 00:21:56,820
to still access the network to the
Internet everything

373
00:21:56,820 --> 00:22:00,918
and other public grandeur is inherent in
802 11n that's the rains have an

374
00:22:00,919 --> 00:22:02,440
augmented by fire

375
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:05,590
arm the reason why do this is

376
00:22:05,590 --> 00:22:08,889
you might get under best circumstances
arrange

377
00:22:08,889 --> 00:22:12,679
out maybe a city block with the wireless
interface which is fine

378
00:22:12,679 --> 00:22:17,090
that city block but when there are
people a city block and change away

379
00:22:17,090 --> 00:22:20,360
can get them on the mash another problem

380
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:24,159
another problem which is that is the
problem this is how do you cook together

381
00:22:24,159 --> 00:22:28,559
multiple meshes in a city which are
separated by distances

382
00:22:28,559 --> 00:22:32,970
farther than the maximum range and wifi
and

383
00:22:32,970 --> 00:22:35,600
it was that you can't assume that there
will be consistent coverage information

384
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:36,690
a city

385
00:22:36,690 --> 00:22:40,490
his adventure and we development spread

386
00:22:40,490 --> 00:22:44,799
where we really packed on this problem
and try to find some creative solutions

387
00:22:44,799 --> 00:22:49,429
if we were to swing by solutions as well
to see what motivated group could do in

388
00:22:49,429 --> 00:22:50,460
an emergency with

389
00:22:50,460 --> 00:22:54,399
the junk they have in their basement
which wrestlers the junk that we had

390
00:22:54,399 --> 00:22:55,320
around ac dc

391
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:59,120
so we tried things like we try building

392
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:02,269
a sound to laser transducer

393
00:23:02,269 --> 00:23:06,389
and we tried a couple different arm will
optical to

394
00:23:06,389 --> 00:23:10,820
Electrical Trades her up with little
receivers we tried some modem

395
00:23:10,820 --> 00:23:14,860
over FRS GMRS radio is which which is
illegal by the way

396
00:23:14,860 --> 00:23:19,120
don't do whatever it takes to he told us
that we took precautions to make sure

397
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:22,690
that we were causing the minimum
interference possible

398
00:23:22,690 --> 00:23:25,929
and long story short don't bother it

399
00:23:25,929 --> 00:23:30,110
even do even doing two radios at a time
forward better communication its

400
00:23:30,110 --> 00:23:34,720
pants it rate we had it we had I packet
loss about 50 percent

401
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:39,210
in the latency over a second please keep
in mind that the two radios were mere

402
00:23:39,210 --> 00:23:41,559
part

403
00:23:41,559 --> 00:23:44,749
but again so

404
00:23:44,749 --> 00:23:47,840
hair yes so some solutions we came up
with

405
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:51,908
are we actually found but doing research
on how other people have solved it

406
00:23:51,909 --> 00:23:56,850
and for example om improvise parabolic
antennas are we've got antennas

407
00:23:56,850 --> 00:24:00,009
on wells in the bases work really well
in fact

408
00:24:00,009 --> 00:24:03,659
there is a there is a project at the
club walk by

409
00:24:03,659 --> 00:24:07,840
where you take a walk straighter and you
poke a hole in the bottom

410
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:11,230
any puts the put a USB wireless
interface

411
00:24:11,230 --> 00:24:14,509
through the whole indicator with
extension cable and

412
00:24:14,509 --> 00:24:18,619
the River and the walk makes a makes
inexplicable

413
00:24:18,619 --> 00:24:22,889
reflector and without when you're able
fire you can hit ten kilometers

414
00:24:22,889 --> 00:24:27,669
in fact this is done routinely in New
Zealand in Afghanistan for white lie

415
00:24:27,669 --> 00:24:31,779
yeah it's really really hard to be wifi
equipment for

416
00:24:31,779 --> 00:24:35,330
availability for cost and for
performance

417
00:24:35,330 --> 00:24:39,080
it's you know this you imply solutions
are gonna come close

418
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:42,090
so in arm we also are doing some
research

419
00:24:42,090 --> 00:24:46,509
in situations where the network
infrastructure is compromise but still

420
00:24:46,509 --> 00:24:47,879
functional for example

421
00:24:47,879 --> 00:24:52,269
here as is being done in Syria at the
packet inspection hardware is popping up

422
00:24:52,269 --> 00:24:54,159
like mushrooms after a rainstorm

423
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:57,710
so it is theoretically possible to
connect aim

424
00:24:57,710 --> 00:25:01,970
mesh network to the Internet to another
mash over a

425
00:25:01,970 --> 00:25:06,190
different connection medium for example
by telling through other network

426
00:25:06,190 --> 00:25:10,210
I by using dial-up which worked really
well during their spring

427
00:25:10,210 --> 00:25:14,019
om part can't buy clothes lines

428
00:25:14,019 --> 00:25:17,519
does really well llame you could do it
over VPN

429
00:25:17,519 --> 00:25:20,539
you get directly to whatever packet
radio bigger been with its gonna be

430
00:25:20,539 --> 00:25:23,590
horrible because it tends to talk about
it and a 6-under

431
00:25:23,590 --> 00:25:27,789
I yeah we have an injury contact DC and
yeah I thought this was pretty

432
00:25:27,789 --> 00:25:28,759
interesting were

433
00:25:28,759 --> 00:25:32,100
gonna try this at some point soon yes
arm

434
00:25:32,100 --> 00:25:35,519
there's also the possibility us the
internet or IP rating carrier

435
00:25:35,519 --> 00:25:39,320
up point which work really well thinking
about how big micro SD cards are getting

436
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:41,610
at allotted and with

437
00:25:41,610 --> 00:25:46,950
yeah 32 gigs on a card the size your
pinky nail

438
00:25:46,950 --> 00:25:50,690
the size I was here again with anywheres
you can be picky

439
00:25:50,690 --> 00:25:53,840
yeah I mean at one point ahead

440
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:57,190
in a at one point during your spring

441
00:25:57,190 --> 00:26:00,700
it's been said that people were bundling
messages and USB keys and shooting them

442
00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:02,190
over the border with slingshots

443
00:26:02,190 --> 00:26:06,259
ok to you work

444
00:26:06,259 --> 00:26:09,710
I'm or even some combination either or
any or all of the above

445
00:26:09,710 --> 00:26:12,200
one of the things that we're shooting
for by the present him as improvise

446
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:12,899
ability

447
00:26:12,899 --> 00:26:16,039
if this is what you got what else do you
have even applied to solve the problem

448
00:26:16,039 --> 00:26:19,860
every emergency situation is different
and sure enough to tell your solution to

449
00:26:19,860 --> 00:26:20,220
you

450
00:26:20,220 --> 00:26:24,970
what's going on sell the wrong number in
cell use cases that have come up in the

451
00:26:24,970 --> 00:26:26,710
development at this very issue no

452
00:26:26,710 --> 00:26:30,110
talks we've given or you know spence
we've had people come in said well you

453
00:26:30,110 --> 00:26:31,269
can use this really you know

454
00:26:31,269 --> 00:26:35,200
all these different things classrooms
conventions on extending the range a

455
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:36,210
home network

456
00:26:36,210 --> 00:26:40,419
community minutes for life I arm in
these are great things that you know I

457
00:26:40,419 --> 00:26:43,820
encourage people to experiment with mesh
networks for these purposes

458
00:26:43,820 --> 00:26:47,100
by it that's not our focus our focus is
really on

459
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:50,149
arm solving the emergency national
problem

460
00:26:50,149 --> 00:26:53,450
where you're creating temporary
infrastructure for emergency

461
00:26:53,450 --> 00:26:54,570
communication

462
00:26:54,570 --> 00:26:58,129
arm not you know a permanent mesh
network

463
00:26:58,129 --> 00:27:01,580
there are lots and other groups that are
working on a problem

464
00:27:01,580 --> 00:27:04,908
and we support them we are working with
them on into you know

465
00:27:04,909 --> 00:27:09,059
the very fact that work in Germany the
Athens while its metropolitan network

466
00:27:09,059 --> 00:27:12,809
commotion Wireless I which is our
community mesh network

467
00:27:12,809 --> 00:27:16,149
from where freedom box are reason live

468
00:27:16,149 --> 00:27:21,029
and Montreal Jazz based on Fri front and
last three in particular we are and

469
00:27:21,029 --> 00:27:24,490
I communication with their developers
and working on and operability

470
00:27:24,490 --> 00:27:28,639
so that I'm you can transition
seamlessly from Byzantium national work

471
00:27:28,639 --> 00:27:29,809
to one up there

472
00:27:29,809 --> 00:27:34,168
I one of their networks

473
00:27:34,169 --> 00:27:38,100
K and we've also have been doing some
threat modeling ignorance experiments

474
00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:38,759
and

475
00:27:38,759 --> 00:27:42,460
we've been working closely with did with
the distance and

476
00:27:42,460 --> 00:27:46,350
Egypt Tunisia in Syria on some the
electronic threats that are seeing over

477
00:27:46,350 --> 00:27:47,029
there

478
00:27:47,029 --> 00:27:50,480
and we've come up with a potential
threats um

479
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:53,450
the nice thing about an ad hoc wireless
mesh is that there's no central

480
00:27:53,450 --> 00:27:56,989
authority that says that you can set up
a mesh know it or have dictates how good

481
00:27:56,989 --> 00:27:58,489
for you mention it

482
00:27:58,489 --> 00:28:03,580
that's also the downside an attacker can
set up a present him nationally as well

483
00:28:03,580 --> 00:28:09,269
com and this is unfortunately no
different from an attacker wasn't when I

484
00:28:09,269 --> 00:28:10,309
ski and saying

485
00:28:10,309 --> 00:28:14,379
you're going to install this box in Iraq
know when Tony with traffic goes

486
00:28:14,379 --> 00:28:18,499
she has ever heard a group with a dejar

487
00:28:18,499 --> 00:28:23,700
but with a few days home also a lot to
distribute services don't incorporate

488
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:28,860
don't incorporate traffic and by that we
mean are let's say you have a massively

489
00:28:28,860 --> 00:28:30,269
distributed

490
00:28:30,269 --> 00:28:34,070
Twitter work alike and no its fine each
other and they synchronize one another

491
00:28:34,070 --> 00:28:38,950
I you cannot you can count on that
server using SSL or TLS

492
00:28:38,950 --> 00:28:43,090
to get the traffic workers on a mash now
we think that we can mitigate that to a

493
00:28:43,090 --> 00:28:45,389
great extent by using a priest at the
SAC

494
00:28:45,389 --> 00:28:50,330
and we're not there yet it's on our road
map for the next release

495
00:28:50,330 --> 00:28:53,769
I mean that said even if it is using TLS
you don't necessarily

496
00:28:53,769 --> 00:28:57,889
no who the other person is that's you
know setting up that's a retiring what

497
00:28:57,889 --> 00:28:58,460
say you

498
00:28:58,460 --> 00:29:01,610
soon office trustworthy so and

499
00:29:01,610 --> 00:29:05,279
this one reasons why in the captive
portal page that a user sees with the

500
00:29:05,279 --> 00:29:06,489
Press Association the mash

501
00:29:06,489 --> 00:29:10,299
their warned about this higher on a mash
we can trust

502
00:29:10,299 --> 00:29:13,759
you can you cannot necessarily trust
who's running the notes you can

503
00:29:13,759 --> 00:29:16,840
you don't know who's watching you may be
in a surveillance

504
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:20,739
don't deal with sensitive information
don't do anything dumb clicker

505
00:29:20,739 --> 00:29:26,200
to yeah and Fort and forcing his
medication is the best we have for this

506
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:30,889
rate I'm also in this study protocols
tend to suffer from Ron Jackson attacks

507
00:29:30,889 --> 00:29:35,549
because mesh nodes don't have make any
assumptions about

508
00:29:35,549 --> 00:29:39,480
who the nodes are around them there is
no that does periodically receive

509
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:42,970
to policy updates saying hi I'm here I
have a route for high

510
00:29:42,970 --> 00:29:46,480
this right is still good or oh this
bright is going away

511
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:49,659
arm that could be the mesh node two
buildings down

512
00:29:49,659 --> 00:29:53,710
that your best friends at our or to be
somebody injecting routes

513
00:29:53,710 --> 00:29:56,759
now the devil protocol is it is
implementing cryptographic

514
00:29:56,759 --> 00:29:57,409
authentication

515
00:29:57,409 --> 00:30:01,210
routes to prevent someone from injecting
routes manually

516
00:30:01,210 --> 00:30:04,169
yeah this is an answer by the Kraken
developers and I was actually the first

517
00:30:04,169 --> 00:30:05,119
protocol

518
00:30:05,119 --> 00:30:09,200
to start supporting this and is also the
fact that

519
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:13,230
singles going to sing a politician's and
traffic levels are also factor into

520
00:30:13,230 --> 00:30:15,690
account when determining what route to
relieve traffic through

521
00:30:15,690 --> 00:30:19,659
so non-event he describes may not be
used if someone tries to inject

522
00:30:19,659 --> 00:30:23,210
the last problem that we've been working
on as well as damning

523
00:30:23,210 --> 00:30:26,649
and virtually every while its
implementation is viable to jamming

524
00:30:26,649 --> 00:30:29,799
arm present him is no different arm

525
00:30:29,799 --> 00:30:33,408
the best you can really do is have the
nodes jump channel or

526
00:30:33,409 --> 00:30:37,249
try to fly under the radar are whoever
happens he's dead

527
00:30:37,249 --> 00:30:40,499
happens to be were driving looking for
your mesh network are they may be

528
00:30:40,499 --> 00:30:44,440
looking for access points in management
but not ad hoc mode

529
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:48,029
getting here's the thing if you ever see
an ad hoc network called

530
00:30:48,029 --> 00:30:53,669
free public wifi better you know know
know the suspect that if anything

531
00:30:53,669 --> 00:30:56,570
and we know that actually that doesn't
actually go to the internet radio I'll

532
00:30:56,570 --> 00:30:57,668
try that

533
00:30:57,669 --> 00:31:02,679
for it and if your neighbor decides to
act like a jerk in Gentry mesh network

534
00:31:02,679 --> 00:31:06,690
were or carry out some other kind of
DDoS attack then you have the option to

535
00:31:06,690 --> 00:31:07,840
be BRS

536
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:13,519
baseball that restoration service cock

537
00:31:13,519 --> 00:31:16,789
in home we've also been

538
00:31:16,789 --> 00:31:19,649
analyzing and coming up with
countermeasures for threats being seen

539
00:31:19,649 --> 00:31:21,049
right now in the middle east

540
00:31:21,049 --> 00:31:24,899
arm the as happened in Egypt last year

541
00:31:24,899 --> 00:31:28,029
on the routing tables means no traffic
is going anywhere

542
00:31:28,029 --> 00:31:31,759
on the other hand if you don't use net
present your eyes keys infrastructure

543
00:31:31,759 --> 00:31:35,200
you don't really have a problem arm in
Syria

544
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:38,559
a better team the cutting power to ISP
is not a connectivity before sending

545
00:31:38,559 --> 00:31:40,049
tanks into cities

546
00:31:40,049 --> 00:31:45,139
arm a Byzantine misuses independent
equipment if a local ISP goes down

547
00:31:45,139 --> 00:31:48,809
then i said im they're not going to
powering laptop not going to power on

548
00:31:48,809 --> 00:31:50,019
your desktop PC

549
00:31:50,019 --> 00:31:53,179
they're not complaining initiate for UPS

550
00:31:53,179 --> 00:31:57,440
um independent but it means you have a
greater degree of safety

551
00:31:57,440 --> 00:32:00,600
in from attack like that great and
structurally harder

552
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:04,509
because is not one single and you can go
to to shut down the entire network

553
00:32:04,509 --> 00:32:07,669
you have to go yet to go find every
single person running an ode and shut it

554
00:32:07,669 --> 00:32:08,639
down

555
00:32:08,639 --> 00:32:11,999
and they can shut it down and five
minutes later after depose the way they

556
00:32:11,999 --> 00:32:13,230
can with a backup

557
00:32:13,230 --> 00:32:17,989
maybe it's on a different channel maybe
they don't bother getting back to you

558
00:32:17,989 --> 00:32:21,960
um also in Carm I we've got word that
military

559
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:25,289
was were driving from open access points
for a while i in particular the City

560
00:32:25,289 --> 00:32:26,519
homes

561
00:32:26,519 --> 00:32:30,549
on ad hoc nodes from some the
information we got dissidents over there

562
00:32:30,549 --> 00:32:34,259
seem to be slipping under the radar
they're looking forward

563
00:32:34,259 --> 00:32:37,600
looking for a piece to manage motor and
there either

564
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:41,559
ignoring ad hoc nodes entirely because
our software can cope with it

565
00:32:41,559 --> 00:32:44,590
or their dismissing it as free public
wifi

566
00:32:44,590 --> 00:32:49,549
arm they might catch on to this in the
future

567
00:32:49,549 --> 00:32:53,359
we don't know if we don't know when arm
all we can do is keep your eyes open

568
00:32:53,359 --> 00:32:56,909
keepers o'bannon hope for the best now
I'm not one thing to keep in mind is

569
00:32:56,909 --> 00:33:00,889
that ad hoc networks are dependent on
the BS aside enough that your society

570
00:33:00,889 --> 00:33:05,019
so in theory basin him know it's all
over the city can all have

571
00:33:05,019 --> 00:33:08,220
can be announcing different network
names but as long as I'm using the same

572
00:33:08,220 --> 00:33:09,559
BS society

573
00:33:09,559 --> 00:33:13,139
they'll still in trouble with one
another as expected great and that makes

574
00:33:13,139 --> 00:33:15,639
it so that not ever you know you're not
busy anymore

575
00:33:15,639 --> 00:33:20,059
place could now be conspicuous in yeah
but lexus is OK

576
00:33:20,059 --> 00:33:24,609
Mike and free public wifi ok

577
00:33:24,609 --> 00:33:27,820
day they also social engineering attacks
if they can be carried out to gather

578
00:33:27,820 --> 00:33:28,720
intelligence

579
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:32,340
arm as we said earlier we want people to
get with sensitive information

580
00:33:32,340 --> 00:33:34,409
especially the people that

581
00:33:34,409 --> 00:33:37,830
are calling themselves 0-1 years in jail

582
00:33:37,830 --> 00:33:42,419
arm you really have to use discretion
and if it seems shady you can always do

583
00:33:42,419 --> 00:33:43,210
its last quit

584
00:33:43,210 --> 00:33:47,609
come back five minutes later the
different neck mom yeah we we all know

585
00:33:47,609 --> 00:33:48,600
here that

586
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:51,940
that the user education part is the
hardest part

587
00:33:51,940 --> 00:33:56,059
this defects arm that always gonna be a
problem that's the 1i believe that can't

588
00:33:56,059 --> 00:33:57,989
be solved

589
00:33:57,989 --> 00:34:01,320
yeah all you can do is keep warning
people when hope they listen

590
00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:06,399
arm also lbs experience with operational
security training online

591
00:34:06,399 --> 00:34:10,570
for communicating with dissidents for
drinking with journalists and things

592
00:34:10,570 --> 00:34:11,520
like that

593
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:15,149
om same training applies an amazing
Himesh

594
00:34:15,149 --> 00:34:19,199
and also there is the issue open source
intelligence surveillance a public sites

595
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:21,080
like Facebook Twitter

596
00:34:21,080 --> 00:34:25,399
arm other social networks we know this
is happening in Syria quite heavily

597
00:34:25,399 --> 00:34:26,449
these days

598
00:34:26,449 --> 00:34:30,060
on what's happening in the countries as
well & Byzantine resources

599
00:34:30,060 --> 00:34:33,989
don't touch the public net especially if
you're but if you resources don't touch

600
00:34:33,990 --> 00:34:35,290
a public net so

601
00:34:35,290 --> 00:34:38,730
a distant its way to work like or the
IRC network

602
00:34:38,730 --> 00:34:42,668
will not pay to rate with servers on the
public Internet so

603
00:34:42,668 --> 00:34:45,839
if you're not actually national public
Internet then it is

604
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:49,050
so they say for then going on

605
00:34:49,050 --> 00:34:53,590
down at or anything like that yeah might
fly under the radar a little bit longer

606
00:34:53,590 --> 00:34:57,080
it's also inherently localized so
someone is looking for something in

607
00:34:57,080 --> 00:35:01,020
this country they're not going putting
up with a pick up and started talking

608
00:35:01,020 --> 00:35:03,660
about this country

609
00:35:03,660 --> 00:35:06,910
there was a potential threats in other
countries on social engineering attacks

610
00:35:06,910 --> 00:35:09,310
enable traders work all around the world

611
00:35:09,310 --> 00:35:12,799
arm again operational security warnings
in training

612
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:17,310
that's best we've especially have
passive surveillance is a problem

613
00:35:17,310 --> 00:35:20,930
I am that's somewhat mitigated by
exception of traffic between nodes

614
00:35:20,930 --> 00:35:24,560
it's also mitigated by encryption up
traffic from the client and server back

615
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:25,259
again

616
00:35:25,260 --> 00:35:28,570
so if someone is just when TCP don't
they're just going to see a as a selling

617
00:35:28,570 --> 00:35:29,990
the Leicester

618
00:35:29,990 --> 00:35:33,480
active surveillance attacks are
mitigated with OPSEC

619
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:37,090
once again let's keep being on that nail
art what's wife

620
00:35:37,090 --> 00:35:40,540
are also that Louis have the network
architecture makes

621
00:35:40,540 --> 00:35:44,240
helps to deter active surveillance
somewhat arm there's nothing that says

622
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:45,610
that I sent him node

623
00:35:45,610 --> 00:35:49,560
can't be running in your backpack or can
be under your shirt

624
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:53,990
stage bronzed age yeah

625
00:35:53,990 --> 00:35:59,190
good job years into yeah

626
00:35:59,190 --> 00:36:03,160
um it also avoids the packet inspection
equipment

627
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:06,730
so again not using entrusted are not
using

628
00:36:06,730 --> 00:36:10,860
and I skis infrastructure any attacks or
go into the Huskies infrastructure won't

629
00:36:10,860 --> 00:36:12,100
touch you

630
00:36:12,100 --> 00:36:15,270
om seizure loads is something a problem

631
00:36:15,270 --> 00:36:18,950
arm buys a few bucks but about is not
use persistent storage

632
00:36:18,950 --> 00:36:23,250
everything is running rampant it's a
live distro and when you kill the power

633
00:36:23,250 --> 00:36:26,640
in about 30 seconds a conference
agreement on

634
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:29,790
from there is support out the box
however foreign could do business

635
00:36:29,790 --> 00:36:30,840
storage

636
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:35,550
so if you want to install Byzantine 1x
on an external one terabyte hard drive

637
00:36:35,550 --> 00:36:39,400
you can set up a datastore which is
incredible looks

638
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:42,790
which will which is automatically
mounted would get a property for a

639
00:36:42,790 --> 00:36:43,560
passphrase

640
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:47,420
you and your passphrase you do enter
strong pass races right

641
00:36:47,420 --> 00:36:50,800
yeah s

642
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:54,670
rather you have never guessed sex

643
00:36:54,670 --> 00:36:59,530
um also notes can be billion RQS case in
point netbook

644
00:36:59,530 --> 00:37:03,990
which has been sitting there that I'll I

645
00:37:03,990 --> 00:37:08,000
gathered if we had known as maybe he
won't

646
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:11,480
yeah home

647
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:15,440
and somebody sitting on a subway with
tip typing on the netbook

648
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:18,850
looks pretty similar to somebody else
sitting on their on some weight had been

649
00:37:18,850 --> 00:37:19,610
a netbook

650
00:37:19,610 --> 00:37:22,970
differences one person has microsoft
office open

651
00:37:22,970 --> 00:37:27,750
and the other person has web browser but
that web browser is connected to the

652
00:37:27,750 --> 00:37:32,050
IRC server that they're running on a
present you note in their lap

653
00:37:32,050 --> 00:37:35,460
unless you grab someone for them on the
ground and go through the laptop you're

654
00:37:35,460 --> 00:37:37,960
not really gonna know what's going on

655
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:41,260
and of course there's the ever-present
danger I love your service provider

656
00:37:41,260 --> 00:37:41,850
being

657
00:37:41,850 --> 00:37:46,310
it being sent subpoenas and/or um gag
orders

658
00:37:46,310 --> 00:37:49,680
if you don't use the ISP's
infrastructure you're into that great

659
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:54,020
and you know in case the National work
there is no 1i is PT contact

660
00:37:54,020 --> 00:37:58,290
so kept so what you need

661
00:37:58,290 --> 00:38:01,770
we need more developers right now it's
basically just the three of us

662
00:38:01,770 --> 00:38:04,500
I'll be available we have a couple
weekend warriors who come in for

663
00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:06,390
developments friends but

664
00:38:06,390 --> 00:38:10,839
yet we need we need developers are the
control panels written in Python so if

665
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:12,070
you know smite on

666
00:38:12,070 --> 00:38:16,050
armpit user help especially
knowledgeable 18 and Andy buss

667
00:38:16,050 --> 00:38:19,130
so that we can make this
internationalized because not everyone

668
00:38:19,130 --> 00:38:19,940
speaks English

669
00:38:19,940 --> 00:38:24,270
surprisingly enough we need our people
with experience

670
00:38:24,270 --> 00:38:27,450
an 1/8 administration Angele skirting
cuz thats you know

671
00:38:27,450 --> 00:38:30,910
the rest is offering has been in dash on

672
00:38:30,910 --> 00:38:34,790
user interface design if you know when
you guys you get a copy all see

673
00:38:34,790 --> 00:38:38,890
our skills a CSS arm yeah I

674
00:38:38,890 --> 00:38:42,390
are many people testing and filing by
reports

675
00:38:42,390 --> 00:38:46,750
be used by our bug reports if you can
fix it Sanders patches and get help

676
00:38:46,750 --> 00:38:50,550
arm but you know even just saying that
hate is a problem here or with this

677
00:38:50,550 --> 00:38:52,890
hardware configuration or I tried this
and it didn't work

678
00:38:52,890 --> 00:38:56,089
or what this feature arm that hopes to
you

679
00:38:56,090 --> 00:38:59,130
arm by reports let us know that you know

680
00:38:59,130 --> 00:39:02,710
that their things to fix otherwise its
talking to get done

681
00:39:02,710 --> 00:39:06,610
arm if and we need people that don't
have tech skills if you just

682
00:39:06,610 --> 00:39:09,710
if you can translate if you can lay
documentation arm

683
00:39:09,710 --> 00:39:13,010
if you can you know promote proper
permits people who can you know

684
00:39:13,010 --> 00:39:16,720
arm that would be very very helpful are
and his back and his right now

685
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:20,770
is is not pretty yeah I'm

686
00:39:20,770 --> 00:39:24,509
and also mean people running present in
1x on as many different laptops

687
00:39:24,510 --> 00:39:26,990
computers as possible because we're
trying to build a hardware compatibility

688
00:39:26,990 --> 00:39:28,170
list

689
00:39:28,170 --> 00:39:31,810
and weariness with such as when we were

690
00:39:31,810 --> 00:39:35,930
are pressing the right now CD is that
we'd like to hand out afterward

691
00:39:35,930 --> 00:39:40,210
and we just need will be more people
running it means know what works means

692
00:39:40,210 --> 00:39:41,260
know what doesn't work

693
00:39:41,260 --> 00:39:44,640
well from where do we have to include do
we have to install kernel patch do we

694
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:46,740
have to enable driver recompile

695
00:39:46,740 --> 00:39:50,320
we need to know these things and we have
only to only a limited amount of Harvard

696
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:55,120
do it on great so are crowd-sourcing
that testing to you guys

697
00:39:55,120 --> 00:39:58,430
click summer crowdsourcing raid and

698
00:39:58,430 --> 00:40:02,230
I CNN is any other suggestions or a
Ponzi have

699
00:40:02,230 --> 00:40:06,510
let us know please and this is where you
can let us know

700
00:40:06,510 --> 00:40:11,600
this is how you contact us arm we are
happy have a channel on freenode we have

701
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:12,910
you know it's for hash tag

702
00:40:12,910 --> 00:40:16,970
are the project hosted on: get hard and
and of course you can subscribe to our

703
00:40:16,970 --> 00:40:17,700
mailing list

704
00:40:17,700 --> 00:40:20,860
and there's often a lot of interesting
discussion on our mailing list Larry

705
00:40:20,860 --> 00:40:22,100
recommended

706
00:40:22,100 --> 00:40:26,569
good songs

707
00:40:26,570 --> 00:40:30,540
great %um

708
00:40:30,540 --> 00:40:34,680
store general your said

709
00:40:34,680 --> 00:40:38,390
yeah gonna Syrian home yeah

710
00:40:38,390 --> 00:40:41,470
but out be sorry microphones arm

711
00:40:41,470 --> 00:40:44,800
so on the mailing list it's not it's not
just the

712
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:49,080
Byzantium specific star we have water
tangential stuff like

713
00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:52,170
were looking for services that we can
use

714
00:40:52,170 --> 00:40:55,180
to put on your mags for there's no
internet connection

715
00:40:55,180 --> 00:40:58,870
stuff like that is one that kinda stuff
that comes across those losses

716
00:40:58,870 --> 00:40:59,750
interesting

717
00:40:59,750 --> 00:41:05,430
through articles mock pressler not drug
related to plant in baja related to that

718
00:41:05,430 --> 00:41:08,440
that who yeah discussions I just working
general

719
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:12,160
even are subject to national learning
it's a good place to and it's not a

720
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:13,310
supermodel traffic

721
00:41:13,310 --> 00:41:17,160
so it's you know it's like a plan your
inbox right thing we put that developer

722
00:41:17,160 --> 00:41:17,680
stuff

723
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:21,529
in ongoing you know digest on the list
separate yeah

724
00:41:21,530 --> 00:41:24,680
so immediately after this talk we will
be

725
00:41:24,680 --> 00:41:30,450
downstairs in the hackerspace the area
we have 500 copies on CD to give away

726
00:41:30,450 --> 00:41:33,920
and we're gonna try and help would be
yes then can master

727
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:39,820
an hour to get here at went in just 26
our go

728
00:41:39,820 --> 00:41:43,690
good Wes

729
00:41:43,690 --> 00:41:46,920
that does include time for %ah

730
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:51,590
you know making it work and midnight
making the machine or

731
00:41:51,590 --> 00:41:56,090
yes the duplicators bit dodgy rates so
I'm

732
00:41:56,090 --> 00:41:59,650
comments questions suggestions that we
have about 10 minutes for questions of

733
00:41:59,650 --> 00:42:02,180
people having please line up behind me
and I'll get out the way

734
00:42:02,180 --> 00:42:06,220
axle have two men are like you okay or
yeah

735
00:42:06,220 --> 00:42:11,320
to stay with his own room 9 I was under
the impression is just this one wrong

736
00:42:11,320 --> 00:42:14,540
okay do you have any

737
00:42:14,540 --> 00:42:17,700
plans turn integrated into the router
firmware

738
00:42:17,700 --> 00:42:20,990
arms in our yes I will always so

739
00:42:20,990 --> 00:42:24,560
the the Nash routing software it's all
on

740
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:28,090
is already compiled from various are you
know our farmers

741
00:42:28,090 --> 00:42:31,790
daily OpenWrt but he said that sperm in
infrastructure and that's something that

742
00:42:31,790 --> 00:42:32,730
we're focusing on

743
00:42:32,730 --> 00:42:35,870
we're focusing I'm you know commodity
hardware the PRT out

744
00:42:35,870 --> 00:42:38,980
in an emergency with washing your router
is

745
00:42:38,980 --> 00:42:42,160
a lot harder than sticking and ASEAN
maybe your your machine

746
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:46,000
but the other network aren't met the
other national budget you mention

747
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:50,560
a while and focus on just me on just
that are more permanent infrastructure

748
00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:51,490
mesh networks

749
00:42:51,490 --> 00:42:55,490
the real value added that we brynn is
that we have our

750
00:42:55,490 --> 00:42:59,370
the stack up services on top of that
software

751
00:42:59,370 --> 00:43:03,819
it's just that software all you have to
do is disturbing configuration files

752
00:43:03,820 --> 00:43:06,880
honor otherwise you

753
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:10,120
kind of our a network that doesn't have
anything going on at

754
00:43:10,120 --> 00:43:13,640
so we we are done services about it was

755
00:43:13,640 --> 00:43:17,490
easy to use I know motivate people to
actually use it

756
00:43:17,490 --> 00:43:21,970
instead you know having to try and get
up to the Internet to do things you can

757
00:43:21,970 --> 00:43:22,850
do things lovely

758
00:43:22,850 --> 00:43:26,580
with our on a side um

759
00:43:26,580 --> 00:43:30,110
too pretty for questions one is I know
commotion is done some

760
00:43:30,110 --> 00:43:33,830
work on trying to deal with

761
00:43:33,830 --> 00:43:38,060
temporary connections to the real
Internet address to the Internet

762
00:43:38,060 --> 00:43:42,130
whether any support within his and him
for multiple bad connections the net

763
00:43:42,130 --> 00:43:46,550
in a bid to have his house all is the
512 megabytes of RAM a farm you haven't

764
00:43:46,550 --> 00:43:47,130
get up

765
00:43:47,130 --> 00:43:51,140
which since I love Raspberry Pi is seems
to help a lot to me

766
00:43:51,140 --> 00:43:55,620
really okay so if you're running it on
x86

767
00:43:55,620 --> 00:43:58,720
at it actually the bite was based on
running

768
00:43:58,720 --> 00:44:02,150
the KT E are Alex the arm

769
00:44:02,150 --> 00:44:05,540
your desktop environments if you're not
running as a summons obviously you need

770
00:44:05,540 --> 00:44:06,330
a lot less RAM

771
00:44:06,330 --> 00:44:09,650
arm by you know we that's how we've been
testing is by

772
00:44:09,650 --> 00:44:13,720
putting up a whole you know yeah but
this bish out by the Dozen moment

773
00:44:13,720 --> 00:44:17,370
in the ice snow and ice is only about
former megabytes is actually lesson for

774
00:44:17,370 --> 00:44:18,259
makers also

775
00:44:18,260 --> 00:44:21,830
box yes so on

776
00:44:21,830 --> 00:44:25,279
but your first question was about I we
support having multiple gateways and

777
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:25,840
actually we

778
00:44:25,840 --> 00:44:29,290
seamlessly are we in the next release
will seamlessly interoperate with

779
00:44:29,290 --> 00:44:30,390
Commission networks

780
00:44:30,390 --> 00:44:33,460
we use the same the SSID is they do so
that

781
00:44:33,460 --> 00:44:36,540
omg you're already on the same you know
ad hoc network

782
00:44:36,540 --> 00:44:40,080
it's just a matter of getting the
routing software to talk to each other

783
00:44:40,080 --> 00:44:44,230
and thats like that close to being done
hmm

784
00:44:44,230 --> 00:44:48,140
I um I was wondering if you

785
00:44:48,140 --> 00:44:51,740
I had two questions but you had a third
into min ago

786
00:44:51,740 --> 00:44:55,060
I was wondering if you considered 86 is
that a

787
00:44:55,060 --> 00:45:00,630
the the rock on baby things we are so
and you know he actually uses both ipv4

788
00:45:00,630 --> 00:45:01,730
and ipv6

789
00:45:01,730 --> 00:45:04,870
OKC good the configuration going on yes
wires

790
00:45:04,870 --> 00:45:08,359
ipv6 site sorry there our own and

791
00:45:08,360 --> 00:45:12,560
the second question was about I am rub

792
00:45:12,560 --> 00:45:17,210
he said you were indicating routes there
was money I get the app and

793
00:45:17,210 --> 00:45:20,210
on are men on how you wouldn't do that

794
00:45:20,210 --> 00:45:23,740
honey works yeah we're not running that
dollar battle yet I would mean

795
00:45:23,740 --> 00:45:28,430
when he went into code please 4.2 amber
I think was nine hours later

796
00:45:28,430 --> 00:45:32,089
the next release the BB man came out
which had preliminary support for

797
00:45:32,090 --> 00:45:36,260
but how the how did work go like whereas
lake house doesn't make their central

798
00:45:36,260 --> 00:45:37,580
authority rather you

799
00:45:37,580 --> 00:45:41,069
resolve the problem I haven't read the
code yet because we were too busy trying

800
00:45:41,070 --> 00:45:41,580
to get

801
00:45:41,580 --> 00:45:45,580
this release ready yeah we didn't coach
shocked but if you read the specs for

802
00:45:45,580 --> 00:45:46,040
battle

803
00:45:46,040 --> 00:45:49,210
there is a there are actually two
different places within

804
00:45:49,210 --> 00:45:52,850
the packets that uses that allow for

805
00:45:52,850 --> 00:45:55,920
back to a live feed us to relax and a
cryptographic information

806
00:45:55,920 --> 00:46:00,140
so that the packet can be are checked
again co.'s injured

807
00:46:00,140 --> 00:46:03,730
that hasn't been arm you know are fairly
modified

808
00:46:03,730 --> 00:46:07,990
by you know in middle and agence call
Byzantine because we're trying to build

809
00:46:07,990 --> 00:46:11,170
Byzantine fault-tolerant system so thats

810
00:46:11,170 --> 00:46:14,340
on it's there there will be more details
on that shortly

811
00:46:14,340 --> 00:46:17,800
you noticed it still in development arm
active development so

812
00:46:17,800 --> 00:46:21,870
it's not quite finalized yet and we have
earned them we haven't done any

813
00:46:21,870 --> 00:46:25,880
internal to the match we haven't
implemented any DNS because we don't

814
00:46:25,880 --> 00:46:27,130
want a central authority

815
00:46:27,130 --> 00:46:30,820
doing anything yeah at that actually
went to the really hard problems as

816
00:46:30,820 --> 00:46:31,950
decentralizing

817
00:46:31,950 --> 00:46:36,030
name services because you know handling
name arbitration

818
00:46:36,030 --> 00:46:40,580
without a central authority is is a
challenge I thank you

819
00:46:40,580 --> 00:46:44,630
yeah

820
00:46:44,630 --> 00:46:49,890
you mentioned you dresses earlier im
talking about sparsity of nodes

821
00:46:49,890 --> 00:46:53,920
in an emergency environment obviously
most people in us

822
00:46:53,920 --> 00:46:57,300
in the city are knocking be running
Byzantium so there's going to be

823
00:46:57,300 --> 00:47:00,630
arm mesh networks and disconnected

824
00:47:00,630 --> 00:47:03,650
on what have you done tuned address this

825
00:47:03,650 --> 00:47:07,280
because it be known as the point to
point you're not using a document based

826
00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:12,060
running are you focusing on ordered
prison border

827
00:47:12,060 --> 00:47:16,259
protocols that use EPA to transfer
messages are you dressing that at all or

828
00:47:16,260 --> 00:47:20,480
is interesting that you mentioned mom
were we don't present in the next on top

829
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:24,300
distribution called party is lax which
has another fork

830
00:47:24,300 --> 00:47:28,030
called fighters lacks which is a full
implementation of the fighter net

831
00:47:28,030 --> 00:47:29,610
protocol

832
00:47:29,610 --> 00:47:33,310
and we have their packages at work look
we're looking at it to see how it works

833
00:47:33,310 --> 00:47:36,750
and as we add services to the mash

834
00:47:36,750 --> 00:47:39,950
are also looking at doing high latency

835
00:47:39,950 --> 00:47:43,740
up her bundle based synchronization
between measures

836
00:47:43,740 --> 00:47:47,100
so hopefully at some point you'll be
able to plug USB key n

837
00:47:47,100 --> 00:47:51,660
you know tell you to un rotator move it
you remove it

838
00:47:51,660 --> 00:47:54,899
get on your bike go to the box where the
next node plug it in

839
00:47:54,900 --> 00:47:58,090
will synchronize and basically you're
playing round-robin

840
00:47:58,090 --> 00:48:01,690
I we also talked a little bit about that
in these and other international Inc's

841
00:48:01,690 --> 00:48:02,860
thing where

842
00:48:02,860 --> 00:48:06,340
what we do ideally like to see is what
you know it's one which has a client

843
00:48:06,340 --> 00:48:06,760
inter

844
00:48:06,760 --> 00:48:09,860
has a measured pace with a client
interface and the other is a parabolic

845
00:48:09,860 --> 00:48:10,420
dish

846
00:48:10,420 --> 00:48:14,620
which goes across town to the next mash
great um

847
00:48:14,620 --> 00:48:17,660
the theory is sound we know it works
it's being done

848
00:48:17,660 --> 00:48:22,330
is being done its work by arm we have
yet to build that functionality

849
00:48:22,330 --> 00:48:26,790
into our control panel that's that is on
the road map for the next release

850
00:48:26,790 --> 00:48:29,980
yet we all have full-time jobs so you
were doing this

851
00:48:29,980 --> 00:48:33,270
you on your names on the weekends we're
giving as much time as you can but

852
00:48:33,270 --> 00:48:34,950
there's a lot to do

853
00:48:34,950 --> 00:48:39,490
and there's just three months

854
00:48:39,490 --> 00:48:43,080
and he experimented with any Voice over
IP protocols

855
00:48:43,080 --> 00:48:46,470
over Babel measures we had %uh

856
00:48:46,470 --> 00:48:50,100
in with the early releases I we actually
had mambo set up

857
00:48:50,100 --> 00:48:53,520
um we had a mobile server which was I
make the configured we also had a couple

858
00:48:53,520 --> 00:48:54,759
member clients

859
00:48:54,760 --> 00:48:58,710
and a problem was actually the mumble
package he's breaking on syntax

860
00:48:58,710 --> 00:49:03,670
yet and we ate but with it for a while
and realize that it was more important

861
00:49:03,670 --> 00:49:08,220
to get the control panel stabilizing get
another release as we gather feedback

862
00:49:08,220 --> 00:49:11,900
then it was too bite with more and
figure out how to unbrick part but not

863
00:49:11,900 --> 00:49:13,060
dissimilar from the

864
00:49:13,060 --> 00:49:16,529
from voice over IP one of the first
things we usually do we get our network

865
00:49:16,530 --> 00:49:17,160
up and running

866
00:49:17,160 --> 00:49:21,470
is streaming audio and YouTube videos

867
00:49:21,470 --> 00:49:24,910
arm you mentioned there's a web server
include ish

868
00:49:24,910 --> 00:49:29,299
yes but there's no DNA central DNS right
how does one connector that

869
00:49:29,300 --> 00:49:33,250
web server we cheated him

870
00:49:33,250 --> 00:49:37,180
when you when you get past their first
couple page there's a

871
00:49:37,180 --> 00:49:42,149
page was pondering some services so
those are going directly to the IP is an

872
00:49:42,150 --> 00:49:42,980
updated

873
00:49:42,980 --> 00:49:47,240
yet updated through borrowing great so
it was nice for a pardon me

874
00:49:47,240 --> 00:49:50,350
messages with certain attributes sir

875
00:49:50,350 --> 00:49:54,910
dancers also the IRC server and whatever
else you wanna have database server

876
00:49:54,910 --> 00:49:58,129
rate so instead of having a Domain Name
Service

877
00:49:58,130 --> 00:50:02,010
we're gonna I have I know it's announce
what sources they have

878
00:50:02,010 --> 00:50:05,350
so that it can be you know you can we go
on a website and see what's urs Israel

879
00:50:05,350 --> 00:50:06,620
on MASH

880
00:50:06,620 --> 00:50:10,109
yeah anywhere access to my click on a
link which references IP addresses and I

881
00:50:10,110 --> 00:50:13,670
whose names

882
00:50:13,670 --> 00:50:17,470
so in your hardware testing or in the
case I'll someone having

883
00:50:17,470 --> 00:50:22,420
one laptop desktop whatever have you
done any VM testing to see if the pastor

884
00:50:22,420 --> 00:50:26,240
that workings a problem that is a
primary development

885
00:50:26,240 --> 00:50:29,340
configuration so yeah we

886
00:50:29,340 --> 00:50:33,260
I don't get paid I know the pass through
says we use the other and you can solder

887
00:50:33,260 --> 00:50:36,380
again yeah yahoo.com are

888
00:50:36,380 --> 00:50:41,120
a November converter box about and
second question have you considered

889
00:50:41,120 --> 00:50:45,870
a tarpon fast-track Graham to her sister
would develop

890
00:50:45,870 --> 00:50:49,870
thingy military may have an interest in
helping yeah just see him had he been

891
00:50:49,870 --> 00:50:53,009
other ppl so-and-so grants or so
something that we've been

892
00:50:53,010 --> 00:50:56,530
discussing internally not just whether
or not we should buy you know

893
00:50:56,530 --> 00:50:59,670
what you do with that money this is not
something you know we're not in robotics

894
00:50:59,670 --> 00:51:01,360
is now on expensive equipment involved

895
00:51:01,360 --> 00:51:05,100
and it's not really an option for anyone
of us right now to you

896
00:51:05,100 --> 00:51:08,230
abt eight time off from work and do this
full-time

897
00:51:08,230 --> 00:51:11,470
so you well you that money other than
you know

898
00:51:11,470 --> 00:51:15,120
jerry is promoting and stuff and hey
yourselves because they actually

899
00:51:15,120 --> 00:51:19,870
have polluted CFT ray and you rather put
the money towards Lake you know

900
00:51:19,870 --> 00:51:23,000
need you try to find something you know
that would get that

901
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:26,610
arm yet hell I am i wasnt

902
00:51:26,610 --> 00:51:31,580
okay I'm wondering if open garden is
potential

903
00:51:31,580 --> 00:51:35,110
group that you require a trip on inner
interoperability

904
00:51:35,110 --> 00:51:38,380
I'll we love you there's late their
dozens

905
00:51:38,380 --> 00:51:42,260
are different mister gingrich other RB
