1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,259
being ipv6 now this is my first attempt
on surprise everybody

2
00:00:04,259 --> 00:00:07,940
downtown drinking having little time I
am

3
00:00:07,940 --> 00:00:14,940
as leaders ass I i'm joe klein et not
been involved and the ipv6 task force

4
00:00:15,549 --> 00:00:17,320
for ten eleven years

5
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:21,020
the part of the ipv6 forum the new
start-up

6
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:24,439
the cybersecurity task force the

7
00:00:24,439 --> 00:00:27,310
also banned contributor to

8
00:00:27,310 --> 00:00:30,789
bunch government documents two more
interesting ones are the

9
00:00:30,789 --> 00:00:35,120
sp 19 which is the ipv6 from nest

10
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:39,870
and next week the following week the US
CIO will be announcing

11
00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:43,839
be are planning guide roadmap towards
the ipv6 adoption

12
00:00:43,839 --> 00:00:47,620
there's a very large security section
there

13
00:00:47,620 --> 00:00:52,989
on recommendations on implementing ipv6
for government and the commercial space

14
00:00:52,989 --> 00:00:56,190
timelines project plans

15
00:00:56,190 --> 00:01:01,339
again security the slammer

16
00:01:01,340 --> 00:01:03,190
the

17
00:01:03,190 --> 00:01:07,290
not my employer's now my last employers
the one before that

18
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:10,460
burning by at work for or in the future

19
00:01:10,460 --> 00:01:14,570
or the ipv6 task force or any those
people um

20
00:01:14,570 --> 00:01:18,020
honestly I'm here because I P six is now
lost

21
00:01:18,020 --> 00:01:21,399
it's not a sure it is not a like it's
something that we must do

22
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:24,940
I am don't mean to scare you wanna talk
about some

23
00:01:24,940 --> 00:01:31,630
security things I am please be aware
that there is in UN doing this to

24
00:01:31,630 --> 00:01:33,350
discuss

25
00:01:33,350 --> 00:01:36,780
where vulnerabilities exists on the
things I've done research

26
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:41,149
few write this down those may be useful
for additional research

27
00:01:41,149 --> 00:01:44,409
and also vendor-neutral

28
00:01:44,409 --> 00:01:48,609
I am presentation be aware that I will
praise or

29
00:01:48,609 --> 00:01:52,619
now tear down anybody with bad products
so you're

30
00:01:52,619 --> 00:01:56,060
whereof it until they actually fix it
it's starting to work

31
00:01:56,060 --> 00:01:59,600
over the last few years a.m. which is
kinda fun

32
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:03,469
and also Gym bound the former Jim
Ballard who

33
00:02:03,469 --> 00:02:08,679
really was the the ipv6 plumbers when he
was for two hours

34
00:02:08,679 --> 00:02:12,209
he came in at one point he said you know

35
00:02:12,209 --> 00:02:16,260
I need somebody thinks evil because we
love network people and securities none

36
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:20,319
for twelve years ago so I want something
evil to actually think about these

37
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:22,810
protocols come up with some solutions

38
00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:26,400
work with the community quietly try to
get a bunch of things

39
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:30,569
working so you know really have been
quiet for many years

40
00:02:30,569 --> 00:02:34,700
unless eight-years-old started
discussing things

41
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:38,160
openly so at this presentations about

42
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:44,170
okay starting right now we approximate
5.5 devices

43
00:02:44,170 --> 00:02:49,290
the right piece 6 that are a on the ipv4

44
00:02:49,290 --> 00:02:53,739
internet I am were really vying for four
billion

45
00:02:53,739 --> 00:02:57,970
address because that we have a lot of
overhead we have things like Matt

46
00:02:57,970 --> 00:03:01,650
I'm in the process of writing a paper on
be

47
00:03:01,650 --> 00:03:06,090
10 issues that make ipv6 important one
others issues

48
00:03:06,090 --> 00:03:10,549
is the power distribution specifically
or the power utilization for

49
00:03:10,549 --> 00:03:15,340
keep-alive for all their devices I
devices like iPhones

50
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:19,019
com several studies have shown that we
can increase our phone

51
00:03:19,019 --> 00:03:22,870
like expect senior from 13 percent fifty
percent

52
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:25,940
just because a keepalive connections om

53
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:29,579
they also account for Lockheed in our
routers because all the additional

54
00:03:29,579 --> 00:03:33,819
on refreshes a take place for every
single application running on

55
00:03:33,819 --> 00:03:37,720
every single device we're dealing with
so this will actually help us

56
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:41,639
fix on those things will so only have
2.2 billion

57
00:03:41,639 --> 00:03:46,790
people on the earth right now not only
covers 32 percent of those people

58
00:03:46,790 --> 00:03:50,000
have internet access today I am

59
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,180
we're still seeing growth in the
community also

60
00:03:53,180 --> 00:03:56,320
the amount of devices that most of us
have I mean I

61
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:59,570
no Travis right here in the front um

62
00:03:59,570 --> 00:04:02,720
he probably has tens devices just like I
do

63
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:07,199
dislike a lot of you do on where we're
gonna

64
00:04:07,199 --> 00:04:10,500
really require a Cisco is gonna study
and said proxmire

65
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:14,090
$50 billion unique addresses are really
needed

66
00:04:14,090 --> 00:04:17,449
up by 2020 even with alive in

67
00:04:17,449 --> 00:04:21,049
advance NAT capabilities and are a lot
of other

68
00:04:21,048 --> 00:04:25,849
really great ideas um we're not be able
to get there quick enough to really can

69
00:04:25,850 --> 00:04:27,539
be forced to go to ipv6

70
00:04:27,539 --> 00:04:31,139
and summer the I'll

71
00:04:31,139 --> 00:04:34,630
the ipv4 NAT com hands

72
00:04:34,630 --> 00:04:37,850
RFC 1980 18

73
00:04:37,850 --> 00:04:42,770
a lot of these technologies rationally
implement specifically to give us enough

74
00:04:42,770 --> 00:04:43,889
time to get

75
00:04:43,889 --> 00:04:48,530
ipv6 ready to go and because that

76
00:04:48,530 --> 00:04:52,580
we have farm some security ample

77
00:04:52,580 --> 00:04:55,780
a we have some security implications

78
00:04:55,780 --> 00:05:00,300
I am with ipv4 out even worse

79
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:04,600
I do see the top of your heads

80
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:11,000
it's pretty neat on so sensually what we
had is we use as technologies stop-gap

81
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:11,810
right now

82
00:05:11,810 --> 00:05:15,680
as we move forward to ipv6 on IP four
were released to

83
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:21,630
one interface address an ipv6 we start
with three and we could end up with

84
00:05:21,630 --> 00:05:25,520
30 600 a thousand

85
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:29,909
depending on how your systems are set up
that actually provides real challenge

86
00:05:29,910 --> 00:05:33,370
cue track that arm one the other
security

87
00:05:33,370 --> 00:05:37,630
problems right now we have specifically
with that Moss with ipv6

88
00:05:37,630 --> 00:05:42,509
is blacklisting we have so many people
through so many different Nats all we

89
00:05:42,509 --> 00:05:45,509
can say is whatever that frown and Nat
is

90
00:05:45,509 --> 00:05:50,139
that's where we stopped the traffic week
nor everything behind NAT in some cases

91
00:05:50,139 --> 00:05:53,969
we've heard of seven levels deep nap for
email

92
00:05:53,969 --> 00:05:57,460
and for other services which is is
pretty crazy

93
00:05:57,460 --> 00:06:00,508
am

94
00:06:00,509 --> 00:06:06,430
and see

95
00:06:06,430 --> 00:06:12,479
as a today I anna has already delivered
as a February 3rd

96
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:16,419
all love the blocks think I've them as
the main warehouse

97
00:06:16,419 --> 00:06:19,930
are the main production I four ipv4

98
00:06:19,930 --> 00:06:23,779
they've provider all those out to the
regional registries

99
00:06:23,779 --> 00:06:28,949
the challenge now is that for growth
we're depending on the region year old

100
00:06:28,949 --> 00:06:30,319
registries

101
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:34,349
to manage enough ipv4 address space long
enough

102
00:06:34,349 --> 00:06:37,360
so that we can have ipv6 been trapped

103
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:44,360
into operation

104
00:06:44,650 --> 00:06:47,749
by 11 yeah

105
00:06:47,749 --> 00:06:50,900
yes this is another one are ours

106
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:54,909
and already have problems as an example
if you are an

107
00:06:54,909 --> 00:06:58,498
asia-pacific you have to depend on your
carrier

108
00:06:58,499 --> 00:07:01,770
to have an ipv4 address

109
00:07:01,770 --> 00:07:06,150
in most cases they do not they now
deliver only ipv6 addresses and they

110
00:07:06,150 --> 00:07:07,249
provide some

111
00:07:07,249 --> 00:07:10,419
typeof translation a

112
00:07:10,419 --> 00:07:13,830
10 eighteen different translation types
or

113
00:07:13,830 --> 00:07:19,270
Tongling types to get through and get
you to the ipv4 infrastructure

114
00:07:19,270 --> 00:07:22,930
we also see Europe is proximity 16 days
away

115
00:07:22,930 --> 00:07:26,189
so if you do business or I don't know

116
00:07:26,189 --> 00:07:29,809
whatever you do and kinda important
North America

117
00:07:29,809 --> 00:07:34,849
we're talking 73 days are a hell you
orbit must the client's week

118
00:07:34,849 --> 00:07:39,438
I deal with it takes more than seventy
three days just to get justification to

119
00:07:39,439 --> 00:07:44,279
you know change things arm this is a
very short term issue and we'll talk

120
00:07:44,279 --> 00:07:45,999
about the implications

121
00:07:45,999 --> 00:07:49,999
both from securing an operational
standpoint and

122
00:07:49,999 --> 00:07:53,150
Latin America and Africa there following
up very quickly

123
00:07:53,150 --> 00:07:56,150
some the ample a.m. the implications

124
00:07:56,150 --> 00:08:00,360
is dat a lot of these carriers have made
decisions

125
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:03,639
that will slow down communications

126
00:08:03,639 --> 00:08:06,779
manipulate communications on

127
00:08:06,779 --> 00:08:10,900
interfere with trust POW's a

128
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:14,969
I'll the communications which you know
if your intercepting traffic great

129
00:08:14,969 --> 00:08:19,879
but if you want reliable I traffic back
and forth

130
00:08:19,879 --> 00:08:23,749
you really have to think about it and
again seventy five days to Europe

131
00:08:23,749 --> 00:08:27,369
thats the very very short time

132
00:08:27,369 --> 00:08:31,779
on by the way what the carries in a
Pacific are doing is they're using

133
00:08:31,779 --> 00:08:33,710
several different technologies

134
00:08:33,710 --> 00:08:37,330
one technology is ipv6 tunnel over

135
00:08:37,330 --> 00:08:41,599
ipv4 very similar to a protocol called
624

136
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:44,830
um we now refer to that protocol as

137
00:08:44,830 --> 00:08:49,250
6rd what that requires piece a software

138
00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:52,600
on the router dick

139
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:57,680
customer edge device to be able to do
this translation

140
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:01,670
and then be able to connect in either
ipv4 ipv6

141
00:09:01,670 --> 00:09:05,670
on the other sites is manipulation up
that endpoint

142
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:08,729
we also have to stacked late a

143
00:09:08,730 --> 00:09:14,400
which has its own challenges and we also
have nappy TV which

144
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:17,790
is a translator the problem with
translators this point

145
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:22,209
is a it tries to look for an offender
the packet

146
00:09:22,210 --> 00:09:25,850
to deal with the TCP dataset

147
00:09:25,850 --> 00:09:29,399
but if your application is dependent on
IP address

148
00:09:29,399 --> 00:09:36,399
this can cause a lot of problems both
security and corruption data

149
00:09:39,149 --> 00:09:42,250
might see an awesome any businesses

150
00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:45,360
you and up specifically a US IP

151
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:48,610
ISP's on

152
00:09:48,610 --> 00:09:52,580
are trying to figure out how to make
this transition and how to do it cheaply

153
00:09:52,580 --> 00:09:57,700
I a lot of her putting this a.m. process
of by using why these eighteen

154
00:09:57,700 --> 00:09:59,480
transition protocols

155
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:03,649
each these transition protocols have
their own security problems

156
00:10:03,649 --> 00:10:07,850
their own management problems their own
ability or non ability for

157
00:10:07,850 --> 00:10:12,580
intrusion detection and prevention to be
able to parse the packets

158
00:10:12,580 --> 00:10:16,070
and this is this is a very difficult
problem

159
00:10:16,070 --> 00:10:20,830
on we're starting to see vendor starting
to address this

160
00:10:20,830 --> 00:10:26,040
by based on some testing we're really
not seen complete testing

161
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:29,680
I love these transitions also have the
ability to

162
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:33,950
per provide very easy to now service

163
00:10:33,950 --> 00:10:38,220
I to these particular systems which is a
real hassle

164
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:41,660
I some the impacts right now for the
ISP's

165
00:10:41,660 --> 00:10:48,199
is that if you are using wanted these
ISP's in you rely on their mail server

166
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:53,820
and they do not have a ball stack mail
server and DNS

167
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:58,110
I you could literally lose traffic from
certain places in the world

168
00:10:58,110 --> 00:11:01,580
I right now we're seeing Sweden Norway

169
00:11:01,580 --> 00:11:06,730
and countries like that moving natively
to ipv6 only with no ipv4

170
00:11:06,730 --> 00:11:09,930
so if you're doing business or
communicating or

171
00:11:09,930 --> 00:11:14,770
testing their networks on that really
takes a rethink on dealing with that

172
00:11:14,770 --> 00:11:18,930
I am and also connecting connections are
real slow

173
00:11:18,930 --> 00:11:24,290
we'll have an inability to connect user
experience is horrible in many cases

174
00:11:24,290 --> 00:11:29,740
and also a lot of carriers are now
implementing what they call cary great

175
00:11:29,740 --> 00:11:30,680
NAT

176
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:35,410
which means that one ipv4 address

177
00:11:35,410 --> 00:11:39,199
is mapped anywhere from a hundred to a
thousand

178
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:43,770
customers behind it that's nice

179
00:11:43,770 --> 00:11:48,319
cool

180
00:11:48,319 --> 00:11:49,410
back

181
00:11:49,410 --> 00:11:53,759
year ago i anywhere from a hundred to a
thousand customers behind it

182
00:11:53,759 --> 00:11:58,680
some other problems is if you are using
lots of connections

183
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:03,259
you may exhaust the connection pool for
that particular net PT but

184
00:12:03,259 --> 00:12:06,259
that carry great Matt which

185
00:12:06,259 --> 00:12:09,329
they're working on trying to avoid as it
I'll service

186
00:12:09,329 --> 00:12:14,230
I'm also a lot of applications stop it's
great for carriers that want to create

187
00:12:14,230 --> 00:12:20,120
a walled garden to control where you go
and how you can get there

188
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:23,959
but for a lot of people there not going
to be very happy about it

189
00:12:23,959 --> 00:12:27,740
I'm also for businesses

190
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:31,029
and anybody that really want to
communicate you have your own server if

191
00:12:31,029 --> 00:12:34,689
you're not doing ipv6 you're really
creating a self-imposed and I'll service

192
00:12:34,690 --> 00:12:41,690
as a you cool area

193
00:12:42,850 --> 00:12:46,459
you really crazy self a.m. post I'll
service so

194
00:12:46,459 --> 00:12:50,779
it's really your fault at this point are
some security implications

195
00:12:50,779 --> 00:12:55,139
a.m. we're seeing a lot of organizations
trying to slap the SUP

196
00:12:55,139 --> 00:13:00,540
and opening up all kinda security holes
simple things like not copy

197
00:13:00,540 --> 00:13:04,649
opening ipv6 up on the firewall that not
copying the

198
00:13:04,649 --> 00:13:07,910
layer 4 and above

199
00:13:07,910 --> 00:13:13,079
specific protocol configurations and
firewalls an IDS is making sure they

200
00:13:13,079 --> 00:13:14,870
also work on ipv6

201
00:13:14,870 --> 00:13:18,589
just you know doubling the rules
essentially I

202
00:13:18,589 --> 00:13:23,190
rosacea like lotta lacked the training I
get calls regularly from

203
00:13:23,190 --> 00:13:26,870
customer saying this is how I need to
implement

204
00:13:26,870 --> 00:13:31,620
ipv6 but really thinking from an ipv4
standpoint they're not aware some the

205
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:32,589
intricacies

206
00:13:32,589 --> 00:13:35,889
by PB sexual talk about this is we more
Ford

207
00:13:35,889 --> 00:13:39,130
on also many many mistakes

208
00:13:39,130 --> 00:13:43,000
on everything from subnetting addresses
to

209
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,769
am just just bad configurations

210
00:13:46,769 --> 00:13:53,769
and i wanna show you

211
00:13:55,750 --> 00:13:58,500
what we have from the this inside right
now

212
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:03,660
now

213
00:14:03,660 --> 00:14:10,660
by the signal

214
00:14:12,190 --> 00:14:15,250
stole a signal

215
00:14:15,250 --> 00:14:22,250
plugin yeah

216
00:14:35,620 --> 00:14:36,839
this

217
00:14:36,839 --> 00:14:42,850
a loss to display here own area K

218
00:14:42,850 --> 00:14:49,850
you share

219
00:14:51,070 --> 00:14:58,070
thank you

220
00:14:58,270 --> 00:15:02,220
go

221
00:15:02,220 --> 00:15:06,730
so very nice website that gives you a
list up that nest keeps

222
00:15:06,730 --> 00:15:13,320
on the ability for companies and
government agencies to support ipv6

223
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:16,510
and in a sec and as you notice

224
00:15:16,510 --> 00:15:20,090
long attach company names to it

225
00:15:20,090 --> 00:15:27,090
too much this is primarily the US
corporate

226
00:15:27,130 --> 00:15:32,660
world well we're

227
00:15:32,660 --> 00:15:39,510
through be now

228
00:15:39,510 --> 00:15:42,630
so if you're interested go up to this
site

229
00:15:42,630 --> 00:15:46,760
which is on missed you can just do a
search on nest ipv6 DNS ac

230
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:50,030
and you'll get to the site the

231
00:15:50,030 --> 00:15:56,370
the more interesting more interesting
thing about it is those that are

232
00:15:56,370 --> 00:15:58,590
implementing ipv6 for Nana

233
00:15:58,590 --> 00:16:03,310
implementing DNS sac in the corporate
world therefore they're not be able to

234
00:16:03,310 --> 00:16:04,220
take advantage of some

235
00:16:04,220 --> 00:16:11,220
very powerful new tools from a security
perspective

236
00:16:19,209 --> 00:16:25,550
last night

237
00:16:25,550 --> 00:16:32,550
no not again

238
00:16:33,310 --> 00:16:35,519
ago

239
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:42,519
cares

240
00:16:42,620 --> 00:16:47,980
money

241
00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:49,050
ago

242
00:16:49,050 --> 00:16:53,940
and some other the federal government
they actually have a time line right now

243
00:16:53,940 --> 00:17:00,460
as a december 10th procurement policy
came out which if he ran any other

244
00:17:00,460 --> 00:17:02,590
organization you may want to be aware
this

245
00:17:02,590 --> 00:17:06,930
which pretty much states that you have
to be signed off

246
00:17:06,930 --> 00:17:10,770
to be able support ipv6 on your products
as you ship them

247
00:17:10,770 --> 00:17:16,190
I am you can get exceptions but then
that is actually managed and documented

248
00:17:16,190 --> 00:17:17,780
in several different places

249
00:17:17,780 --> 00:17:21,270
so here selling products to the federal
government

250
00:17:21,270 --> 00:17:24,900
or you're in the federal government I
you're supposed to support it

251
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:29,120
won the funny stories I've heard and
this is really it's a procurement

252
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:30,010
challenge

253
00:17:30,010 --> 00:17:33,379
is said I was within one customer

254
00:17:33,380 --> 00:17:37,640
Creda procurement policy make sense they
just kinda forgot to tell the people

255
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:40,540
that do boilers and alarm systems and

256
00:17:40,540 --> 00:17:45,610
systems like that to support ipv6
therefore when they started making the

257
00:17:45,610 --> 00:17:47,260
move toward all sack environment

258
00:17:47,260 --> 00:17:51,110
that a lot products they had to
repurchase so

259
00:17:51,110 --> 00:17:55,250
be aware this is a this can be very
expensive we also see

260
00:17:55,250 --> 00:17:58,300
as I love September 30 the

261
00:17:58,300 --> 00:18:01,530
is a challenge within federal government
to

262
00:18:01,530 --> 00:18:06,940
have all the internet facing services
support ipv6 that means

263
00:18:06,940 --> 00:18:11,020
if a consumer knees website access it's
non cryptid

264
00:18:11,020 --> 00:18:16,270
needs to receiver send mail from the
federal government and also do queries

265
00:18:16,270 --> 00:18:17,670
bit based on DNS

266
00:18:17,670 --> 00:18:21,560
that's real important by 2014 they want
the ability of

267
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:25,820
internal systems be able to reach al
through secure connections

268
00:18:25,820 --> 00:18:29,159
so they can connect to ipv6

269
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:32,230
a native ipv6 and all stacked web
servers

270
00:18:32,230 --> 00:18:35,620
as some the impacts

271
00:18:35,620 --> 00:18:39,540
the US she is really

272
00:18:39,540 --> 00:18:44,290
pushing the ISP's to support ipv6 are
making some real

273
00:18:44,290 --> 00:18:47,830
interesting demands on the carriers

274
00:18:47,830 --> 00:18:52,050
which will help the cat corporate world
won the challenges though is

275
00:18:52,050 --> 00:18:55,530
early more buildings urs lotta research
on making sure that

276
00:18:55,530 --> 00:18:59,200
they're protected and there are some
links

277
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:03,320
on the slides that will point you
policies more scorecard

278
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:10,320
and you guys interested in seeing the
government scorecard

279
00:19:18,309 --> 00:19:24,210
lamar grain to go to the top

280
00:19:24,210 --> 00:19:25,520
growth

281
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:29,100
at this point servicing d an ass

282
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:33,010
and there's says a

283
00:19:33,010 --> 00:19:37,820
a mind about how my demands have been
moved over

284
00:19:37,820 --> 00:19:42,750
you can see Walmart rain here

285
00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:49,750
aroma other organizations are completely
green with hurdle stack environments

286
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:56,649
K

287
00:19:56,649 --> 00:20:01,149
a.m.

288
00:20:01,149 --> 00:20:05,409
trade to their bottom okay flooded the
ad-

289
00:20:05,409 --> 00:20:08,539
components supporting a right now

290
00:20:08,539 --> 00:20:15,539
back to this

291
00:20:20,850 --> 00:20:25,309
so the vast majority of I T and security
staff at this point

292
00:20:25,309 --> 00:20:28,629
are still really unaware arm

293
00:20:28,630 --> 00:20:32,960
even interviewing people and the IT
security domain

294
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:36,159
I routing switching

295
00:20:36,159 --> 00:20:40,370
I admins there to the glad to do was
turn ipv6 of

296
00:20:40,370 --> 00:20:44,509
unfortunately if you've done that on
things like a Microsoft machina

297
00:20:44,509 --> 00:20:48,600
Microsoft 2008 r2 what happens is

298
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:51,779
in many cases it will require reinstall

299
00:20:51,779 --> 00:20:56,679
I'll the operating system all the
applications so

300
00:20:56,679 --> 00:21:00,000
be aware turning it off may cause a lot
of pain for you

301
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:04,149
so which is a real pain in many
different ways

302
00:21:04,149 --> 00:21:07,879
on there also unaware there risks and
they

303
00:21:07,879 --> 00:21:11,120
again they don't set up the host-based
firewalls correctly if they're using

304
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:12,460
some kind have

305
00:21:12,460 --> 00:21:17,350
anti-malware software or say they have a
blacklist lot of Mercy mean that their

306
00:21:17,350 --> 00:21:20,120
current black list blacklist ipv6

307
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:25,620
well there's only one that does it and
it only for email and it's really not

308
00:21:25,620 --> 00:21:26,750
associated with

309
00:21:26,750 --> 00:21:29,830
too much they day only

310
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:35,110
do email and only a very small
population so you really can't C span

311
00:21:35,110 --> 00:21:35,750
coming in

312
00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:41,399
to us interesting another group that I'm
find some real interesting things with

313
00:21:41,399 --> 00:21:43,740
is the auditor's assessment penetration

314
00:21:43,740 --> 00:21:47,480
testing folks a lot amor not aware that
or

315
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:51,210
don't know the right tools to use for a
talk at the end about some the right

316
00:21:51,210 --> 00:21:51,850
tools

317
00:21:51,850 --> 00:21:55,279
and also security performance

318
00:21:55,279 --> 00:21:59,870
monitoring systems are on parity with
ipv4

319
00:21:59,870 --> 00:22:04,779
and so you really unable to see a full
picture what's going on. lot of times

320
00:22:04,779 --> 00:22:05,759
you'll be able see

321
00:22:05,759 --> 00:22:09,990
if you're using NetFlow you'll be able
see that you have ipv6 packets

322
00:22:09,990 --> 00:22:13,740
by unless you have it configured for
tunnels and somebody doesn't do

323
00:22:13,740 --> 00:22:15,370
something crazy like a

324
00:22:15,370 --> 00:22:19,350
a ipv6 packet with three or four
extension headers

325
00:22:19,350 --> 00:22:24,289
you can't parse down with your tools and
you're not be able see inside this

326
00:22:24,289 --> 00:22:25,899
package that's a real problem

327
00:22:25,899 --> 00:22:29,409
um summer recommend recommended sources

328
00:22:29,409 --> 00:22:34,879
is the DNS the dis is staying juniper
has a rubber document a Cisco and

329
00:22:34,879 --> 00:22:35,610
Microsoft

330
00:22:35,610 --> 00:22:40,659
okay

331
00:22:40,659 --> 00:22:46,690
arm a stick into this a little bit
deeper one of the big issues for

332
00:22:46,690 --> 00:22:50,879
address ng was the ability to craft a
hierarchical addressing strategy

333
00:22:50,879 --> 00:22:54,629
and this is a good example of it where
we have I and our

334
00:22:54,629 --> 00:22:58,179
delivering are manufacturing the
addresses shipping into

335
00:22:58,179 --> 00:23:03,490
the regionals I us sending it to the
regionals are nationals

336
00:23:03,490 --> 00:23:07,049
I am locals an ISP's and then

337
00:23:07,049 --> 00:23:12,240
down to the actual end-user I want to
mention that

338
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:15,610
the address space is mapped exactly the
same way

339
00:23:15,610 --> 00:23:19,080
this is pretty neat

340
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:24,080
this is very usefull if you're plying
access control lists

341
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:28,260
this is very usefull if you're doing
some limitations this is something

342
00:23:28,260 --> 00:23:29,669
that's not really

343
00:23:29,669 --> 00:23:33,010
discussed a lot of places as for Zn

344
00:23:33,010 --> 00:23:37,639
application about the way only
one-eighth the

345
00:23:37,639 --> 00:23:42,029
address space has been allocated for
ipv6 at this point

346
00:23:42,029 --> 00:23:45,409
and we've only use just a

347
00:23:45,409 --> 00:23:49,659
less than one-tenth of one percent of
the dresses even allocated which is

348
00:23:49,659 --> 00:23:50,580
kinda interesting

349
00:23:50,580 --> 00:23:53,830
if you notice from the

350
00:23:53,830 --> 00:23:57,908
I Anna they can hand it to regionals and
then

351
00:23:57,909 --> 00:24:02,510
we have four different categories based
on where in the world mostly these are

352
00:24:02,510 --> 00:24:07,379
political constructs that have been
craving countries

353
00:24:07,379 --> 00:24:11,440
and with and organizations nice piece o
be really aware that

354
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:15,090
are you can look some the center mation
of on the WHOIS database

355
00:24:15,090 --> 00:24:19,678
now won the challenges

356
00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:23,570
is although go back one

357
00:24:23,570 --> 00:24:28,379
although we used to have RC 3177 which
set are minimal

358
00:24:28,379 --> 00:24:32,559
address for a provider was a slash 48

359
00:24:32,559 --> 00:24:38,059
48 was for large organizations 54 was
for small businesses and 64 was for an

360
00:24:38,059 --> 00:24:40,379
user

361
00:24:40,380 --> 00:24:44,540
when we try to implement this sin
operational sampling across the Internet

362
00:24:44,540 --> 00:24:46,309
over the last

363
00:24:46,309 --> 00:24:49,279
34 years especially as it's starting to
become popular

364
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:52,389
we found that too things don't work

365
00:24:52,389 --> 00:24:55,399
as an example their cloud providers
handing out

366
00:24:55,399 --> 00:24:58,649
slash 128 ce therefore

367
00:24:58,649 --> 00:25:04,929
reinstated you getting enough addresses
to address multiple cloud environments

368
00:25:04,929 --> 00:25:08,330
day you should be able to deal with the
their only

369
00:25:08,330 --> 00:25:11,678
address and slash 28 also they
identified

370
00:25:11,679 --> 00:25:15,099
it hey if we address if we

371
00:25:15,099 --> 00:25:19,869
allocate all these dresses very quickly
to have a big problem where run out

372
00:25:19,869 --> 00:25:23,669
addresses again they disapprove Jack
Shands okay it's probably

373
00:25:23,669 --> 00:25:28,369
past do you know when we've all retired
in this room but they're still trying to

374
00:25:28,369 --> 00:25:30,729
be a little bit more frugal than they
have before

375
00:25:30,729 --> 00:25:34,679
I am so they've taken the ballot re om

376
00:25:34,679 --> 00:25:37,859
offer the address you now have to
justify

377
00:25:37,859 --> 00:25:41,879
with the I am your upstream provider

378
00:25:41,879 --> 00:25:45,940
how much space that you need for your
particular organization also they doing

379
00:25:45,940 --> 00:25:46,409
this it's

380
00:25:46,409 --> 00:25:50,320
easier to get an address space sometimes
it's very difficult to get a large

381
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:51,779
address space if you're a

382
00:25:51,779 --> 00:25:54,809
cloud provider carrier or

383
00:25:54,809 --> 00:25:59,389
you doing something interesting or
unique a

384
00:25:59,389 --> 00:26:03,019
one the other issues is that they
recognize sites aren't the same

385
00:26:03,019 --> 00:26:07,009
and they have different shapes and sizes
and age we should be able to allocate

386
00:26:07,009 --> 00:26:08,769
address is appropriately to that

387
00:26:08,769 --> 00:26:14,149
I'm also they open up the possibility
even at 6-6 god help us

388
00:26:14,149 --> 00:26:18,609
on the justification this point

389
00:26:18,609 --> 00:26:21,960
I was from to the router vendors

390
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:25,419
was specifically to deal with the

391
00:26:25,419 --> 00:26:30,960
multiple ISP's connections there are
other solutions around the space

392
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:34,330
a.m. too many to discuss on this
particular a

393
00:26:34,330 --> 00:26:38,178
form by it that's one solution

394
00:26:38,179 --> 00:26:41,429
and it's been proposed and some other
sir

395
00:26:41,429 --> 00:26:45,009
are not very happy about it but whatever
arm

396
00:26:45,009 --> 00:26:48,690
also based on the additional projection

397
00:26:48,690 --> 00:26:53,499
the growth rate should be a lot easier
now so if we look at the bottom

398
00:26:53,499 --> 00:26:58,609
up the screen a slash six a slash forty
eight is still the provider the minimal

399
00:26:58,609 --> 00:27:02,470
side for provider independent that may
need the natter use

400
00:27:02,470 --> 00:27:07,989
multiple carriers but now you can make a
request with anything from a slash 32

401
00:27:07,989 --> 00:27:12,570
to a slash 64 anything in between you
can even do it on able boundaries if you

402
00:27:12,570 --> 00:27:13,678
decide so

403
00:27:13,679 --> 00:27:17,369
that's a decision you make based on your
address plan

404
00:27:17,369 --> 00:27:24,279
programmers

405
00:27:24,279 --> 00:27:31,210
yes do you know how many programmers are
unaware that their

406
00:27:31,210 --> 00:27:34,589
layer 7 application has I know

407
00:27:34,589 --> 00:27:38,009
layer 3 code have

408
00:27:38,009 --> 00:27:41,369
miss configurations um

409
00:27:41,369 --> 00:27:45,089
we talk about those in detail based on
some

410
00:27:45,089 --> 00:27:48,720
research on doing at this point as the
research

411
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:53,179
is based on reviewing all the current
born abilities that are in the

412
00:27:53,179 --> 00:27:56,179
the national vulnerability database

413
00:27:56,179 --> 00:27:59,749
and what the actual cost to those who
are and also

414
00:27:59,749 --> 00:28:04,190
I've been doing some testing and
validation of other products so this has

415
00:28:04,190 --> 00:28:05,379
been really interesting

416
00:28:05,379 --> 00:28:09,139
my going to give me a piece which is
actually part of the whole day class bit

417
00:28:09,139 --> 00:28:13,509
from a security standpoint thought that
this was something you guys need to hear

418
00:28:13,509 --> 00:28:18,440
on so it's really interesting how the
programmers

419
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:23,659
will do things like trait cookies that
have addresses

420
00:28:23,659 --> 00:28:27,139
in the cookies pretty neat

421
00:28:27,139 --> 00:28:33,109
plate the receiving code is only defined
for 32 bits

422
00:28:33,109 --> 00:28:36,389
so how do you process

423
00:28:36,389 --> 00:28:40,349
the rest bets kinda interesting

424
00:28:40,349 --> 00:28:44,908
um lot of places where there's buffer
overflows is a versatile been fussing

425
00:28:44,909 --> 00:28:46,739
for a while try to get things fixed

426
00:28:46,739 --> 00:28:50,799
I am lotta places for buffer overflows

427
00:28:50,799 --> 00:28:54,690
source coen dude little bit of a deep
dive arm

428
00:28:54,690 --> 00:28:58,950
I'm using this: the XP screen just giddy
just as a visual

429
00:28:58,950 --> 00:29:03,679
to say well XP by the latest sport I can
be six first

430
00:29:03,679 --> 00:29:07,979
but the second piece is just to give me
some ideas up some other problems as an

431
00:29:07,979 --> 00:29:09,359
example

432
00:29:09,359 --> 00:29:12,489
how's your system allocate are

433
00:29:12,489 --> 00:29:16,749
receive an address is it static link
local

434
00:29:16,749 --> 00:29:21,499
or DHCP are using neighbor discovery
some applications

435
00:29:21,499 --> 00:29:25,349
at layer 7 try to attempt to go around
the API's and

436
00:29:25,349 --> 00:29:30,460
duty around query instead it going
through the standard API for

437
00:29:30,460 --> 00:29:35,179
addresses we also have the the number of
addresses allocate

438
00:29:35,179 --> 00:29:38,789
with a precedence an ipv6 where

439
00:29:38,789 --> 00:29:42,940
if the address is a link local we
communicate via link local fits

440
00:29:42,940 --> 00:29:46,759
the unique local address which is use
within an enterprise

441
00:29:46,759 --> 00:29:50,549
we select that if it's a global address
will reply with that

442
00:29:50,549 --> 00:29:54,109
I am a lot of applications don't know
how to use it and don't know how to

443
00:29:54,109 --> 00:29:55,799
reply correctly

444
00:29:55,799 --> 00:29:59,950
therefore you can see you can run an
application suddenly find that it can't

445
00:29:59,950 --> 00:30:01,239
connect because it

446
00:30:01,239 --> 00:30:04,769
suddenly receive the wrong address or
didn't see it

447
00:30:04,769 --> 00:30:08,349
um cover problem again most

448
00:30:08,349 --> 00:30:12,129
ipv6 systems have 3 Rx's me

449
00:30:12,129 --> 00:30:15,950
to you nick ass addresses and three
multicast addresses

450
00:30:15,950 --> 00:30:20,149
another problem is the done quads

451
00:30:20,149 --> 00:30:23,579
how are you gonna parse this

452
00:30:23,579 --> 00:30:26,908
we have well-known Parsis know that you
know we have

453
00:30:26,909 --> 00:30:32,129
12 to our fifty-five a free to those
addresses how deep are say user

454
00:30:32,129 --> 00:30:33,220
interface

455
00:30:33,220 --> 00:30:36,379
can somebody put additional tax
characters and thus

456
00:30:36,379 --> 00:30:39,889
I am kinda interesting and

457
00:30:39,889 --> 00:30:44,629
and also the length of it the actual
parsing the length of it again

458
00:30:44,629 --> 00:30:48,409
applications that have problems with us

459
00:30:48,409 --> 00:30:52,029
also the subnet I'll

460
00:30:52,029 --> 00:30:55,869
how do you actually address the subnet
issue how do you store

461
00:30:55,869 --> 00:31:00,789
the address itself there are multiple
ways of storing dress we can use it

462
00:31:00,789 --> 00:31:05,809
uncompressed with all 128 thats we go
compressed

463
00:31:05,809 --> 00:31:09,739
well does your application uncompress it

464
00:31:09,739 --> 00:31:14,309
before it actually does it compare order
is it required compression

465
00:31:14,309 --> 00:31:17,470
what happens if you have two sets zeros

466
00:31:17,470 --> 00:31:21,839
are separated by a a an A or additional
character

467
00:31:21,839 --> 00:31:26,389
how do you compress that decompress the
said his ears to the left or the right

468
00:31:26,389 --> 00:31:29,589
again you're out rhythms can be wrong
and it can cause

469
00:31:29,589 --> 00:31:33,129
some real headaches

470
00:31:33,129 --> 00:31:37,729
also network representation I love the
default gateway by default

471
00:31:37,729 --> 00:31:41,559
and we can get this through neighbor
discovery

472
00:31:41,559 --> 00:31:44,879
using air effort 02 con call +1

473
00:31:44,879 --> 00:31:48,619
add but depending on the application

474
00:31:48,619 --> 00:31:52,190
it may not be able find the default
route

475
00:31:52,190 --> 00:31:55,529
if you just move the application ever
directly

476
00:31:55,529 --> 00:32:01,029
another thing is how are you getting DNS
is the application doing the DNS

477
00:32:01,029 --> 00:32:04,049
or is the a.m.

478
00:32:04,049 --> 00:32:08,789
do you have your own a DNS query as an
example the browser's

479
00:32:08,789 --> 00:32:11,809
currently have their own DNS services

480
00:32:11,809 --> 00:32:15,289
that a and caches

481
00:32:15,289 --> 00:32:19,470
if you don't had if you're not
understanding how they work

482
00:32:19,470 --> 00:32:25,649
you could have applications bring in the
wrong data which is pretty neat

483
00:32:25,649 --> 00:32:29,729
will seven-member structures and storage

484
00:32:29,729 --> 00:32:32,839
I what how do you how do you process had
a mullet

485
00:32:32,839 --> 00:32:36,109
manipulate these things in memory how do
you store them

486
00:32:36,109 --> 00:32:39,669
do you store them in a database again
compressed uncompressed

487
00:32:39,669 --> 00:32:43,059
their is 17 ways you can compress it

488
00:32:43,059 --> 00:32:46,178
and you have to had as a standard I'm

489
00:32:46,179 --> 00:32:50,329
also in core memory heavy storm is a
file when you

490
00:32:50,329 --> 00:32:54,269
as a configuration file I found the
several applications just by putting

491
00:32:54,269 --> 00:32:57,859
ipv4 and ipv6 address in it malformed

492
00:32:57,859 --> 00:33:02,579
the crashes and how deep are set date
and also how you

493
00:33:02,579 --> 00:33:09,309
again validated

494
00:33:09,309 --> 00:33:13,569
hi yes the a-six

495
00:33:13,569 --> 00:33:17,049
clever devices have

496
00:33:17,049 --> 00:33:20,349
layer 3 and layer for optimization

497
00:33:20,349 --> 00:33:24,059
on our network arts this is a real
problem

498
00:33:24,059 --> 00:33:27,658
is it well

499
00:33:27,659 --> 00:33:30,859
depending on the provider and the a

500
00:33:30,859 --> 00:33:36,869
agent advice your device may not have
the ability to process in in a sec it

501
00:33:36,869 --> 00:33:39,399
has to then go to the operating system
to

502
00:33:39,399 --> 00:33:42,609
do whatever processing processing takes
place

503
00:33:42,609 --> 00:33:47,169
and real problem the a can cause a real
slow down

504
00:33:47,169 --> 00:33:50,200
expecially paper processing

505
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:53,329
lot addresses addresses it doesn't
understand

506
00:33:53,329 --> 00:33:57,168
addresses with lot serve extension
headers on it

507
00:33:57,169 --> 00:34:00,999
I am there are routers and switches and
other devices

508
00:34:00,999 --> 00:34:05,399
a.m. a speed up cards that essentially
will

509
00:34:05,399 --> 00:34:09,690
crash diet lockup I based on the ASIC

510
00:34:09,690 --> 00:34:12,599
the 10 there some the other things
you've got to be careful from the ASIC

511
00:34:12,599 --> 00:34:13,849
standpoint

512
00:34:13,849 --> 00:34:17,040
is how much memory is allocated

513
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:22,529
some these a6 have not enough memory to
be able to deal with her allocate

514
00:34:22,529 --> 00:34:26,750
128 bits two or three times plus

515
00:34:26,750 --> 00:34:31,460
your quiz on ipv4 address range if
you're running dual stack

516
00:34:31,460 --> 00:34:35,529
so be aware these are decisions you're
after make and not just your allergy

517
00:34:35,529 --> 00:34:38,929
that make this in your switches to

518
00:34:38,929 --> 00:34:44,239
on I have a reference down here too a
sand conference I spoke at

519
00:34:44,239 --> 00:34:48,259
a week and a half ago two weeks ago a
his slider up on the net

520
00:34:48,259 --> 00:34:51,639
talking about even more details on the
ASIC

521
00:34:51,639 --> 00:34:56,359
or you can contact me

522
00:34:56,359 --> 00:34:59,598
so ipv6 launch day quit

523
00:34:59,599 --> 00:35:04,630
you I waited all my life for this well a
long time it feels like

524
00:35:04,630 --> 00:35:08,250
was so young then I'm we have

525
00:35:08,250 --> 00:35:13,059
a lot of organizations participated and
the launch day this was supported by

526
00:35:13,059 --> 00:35:16,920
the Internet Society and particular

527
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:21,410
carriers on here made a specific
commitments so if you have

528
00:35:21,410 --> 00:35:24,910
any these carriers you might find this
interesting

529
00:35:24,910 --> 00:35:27,920
what they committed to is if you are a
new customer

530
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:32,489
or a customer that requesting ipv6

531
00:35:32,489 --> 00:35:36,230
you're supposed to get native ipv6
access

532
00:35:36,230 --> 00:35:40,390
at your home at your business at
wherever

533
00:35:40,390 --> 00:35:45,000
you need access to be aware that was one
other requirements to be able to get

534
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:45,589
through

535
00:35:45,589 --> 00:35:49,980
%uh ipv6 world a something more
interesting things as on IP six world a

536
00:35:49,980 --> 00:35:51,109
1.1

537
00:35:51,109 --> 00:35:54,359
I'll a web sites where enabled

538
00:35:54,359 --> 00:35:58,250
at the million and the a.m.

539
00:35:58,250 --> 00:36:02,819
the database it was interesting that
from Germany standpoint we had

540
00:36:02,819 --> 00:36:06,000
a bigger percentage even though they
have less

541
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:09,640
web sites up on the Internet supporting
ipv6

542
00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:12,759
we look at their US we had very little
participation

543
00:36:12,759 --> 00:36:17,650
although we account for about 45 percent
of all the website out there

544
00:36:17,650 --> 00:36:23,619
kind of Sat I something more interesting
things is %ah come I saw a increase in

545
00:36:23,619 --> 00:36:26,849
traffic it went up to 74%

546
00:36:26,849 --> 00:36:32,480
hits per second which is pretty cool we
saw a page views about 20 7.2 percent

547
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:34,099
page views for

548
00:36:34,099 --> 00:36:40,040
the people it's turn on ipv6 were using
the client's rocky b6 enabled

549
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:44,290
we saw Amsterdam increase by 50 percent
we saw all

550
00:36:44,290 --> 00:36:49,690
a the overall Internet traffic yes it
went from point 024

551
00:36:49,690 --> 00:36:53,109
2.0 41

552
00:36:53,109 --> 00:36:56,619
the last time I spoke it was point 00

553
00:36:56,619 --> 00:37:03,440
4 so we increased

554
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:07,819
here's what the increase look like over
couple years

555
00:37:07,819 --> 00:37:11,930
note the colors the lines

556
00:37:11,930 --> 00:37:18,489
this is really important if we take a
look at it will notice that

557
00:37:18,489 --> 00:37:23,119
the green is native ipv6 there is no
tunneling involved

558
00:37:23,119 --> 00:37:27,470
the other color colors are Thomas
specifically if he notes the red

559
00:37:27,470 --> 00:37:31,279
after helming Microsoft for all this
time

560
00:37:31,279 --> 00:37:35,799
I territo to reno if you call it that

561
00:37:35,799 --> 00:37:38,970
on has lost interest I

562
00:37:38,970 --> 00:37:43,720
or use out on the Internet also knows a
conversion up 624

563
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:49,050
an ipv6 I if you remember I mention the
carry great now at in the

564
00:37:49,050 --> 00:37:52,349
6rd that's basically a a spinoff

565
00:37:52,349 --> 00:37:56,430
love 624 addressing so summer those are
intermixed so

566
00:37:56,430 --> 00:38:00,578
Google sees right now approximately
points 67 traffic

567
00:38:00,579 --> 00:38:07,579
I on the Internet on a regular basis
let's take a look at the evolving

568
00:38:07,690 --> 00:38:08,859
defense tools

569
00:38:08,859 --> 00:38:14,779
first we have the address is

570
00:38:14,780 --> 00:38:21,630
if your gonna brute force that is
starting at 000

571
00:38:21,630 --> 00:38:24,930
000 000 000

572
00:38:24,930 --> 00:38:30,259
blah blah blah and we want to go to the
and a specific network address space

573
00:38:30,260 --> 00:38:33,559
is gonna take a long time on my been

574
00:38:33,559 --> 00:38:37,980
talking about this possum publicly for
years mostly because it's really fun to

575
00:38:37,980 --> 00:38:39,440
get a call from a client saying

576
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:43,099
somebody scanning line at and and

577
00:38:43,099 --> 00:38:47,730
and a red a at should I be concerned

578
00:38:47,730 --> 00:38:51,109
well your dresses are you know

579
00:38:51,109 --> 00:38:55,130
that's the last octet I your dresses are

580
00:38:55,130 --> 00:38:59,790
FF F at Colin and sexy 72

581
00:38:59,790 --> 00:39:03,808
yeah I calculate stuff forty-year should
be retired by then don't worry about it

582
00:39:03,809 --> 00:39:07,630
okay so I get this I a pretty regular
basis

583
00:39:07,630 --> 00:39:10,859
on fortunately we've now started seeing
people

584
00:39:10,859 --> 00:39:14,779
and talk about some the techniques said
II

585
00:39:14,780 --> 00:39:18,200
actually taught in class a few years ago
I

586
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:21,430
which is really smart address are
searching

587
00:39:21,430 --> 00:39:26,669
bullet wanna projects said I've been
working ist identify which

588
00:39:26,670 --> 00:39:29,839
addresses those are so we can avoid
those addresses

589
00:39:29,839 --> 00:39:35,599
but within a large local space if you
have the ability to avoid addresses are

590
00:39:35,599 --> 00:39:39,119
easily discovered are based on either a
single

591
00:39:39,119 --> 00:39:43,690
caning the paying a address query

592
00:39:43,690 --> 00:39:48,180
or actually trying and numerate d an ass
are trying enumerated dresses some cells

593
00:39:48,180 --> 00:39:51,328
based on somebody calling whether
devices dead beef

594
00:39:51,329 --> 00:39:54,770
as an example I am their ways a stopping
that

595
00:39:54,770 --> 00:39:57,930
the therefore the nice thing about this

596
00:39:57,930 --> 00:40:02,598
is from a separability standpoint some a
square in your network on dresses

597
00:40:02,599 --> 00:40:05,880
on your local network on addresses that

598
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:08,910
don't exist this is a good indication of

599
00:40:08,910 --> 00:40:12,490
you have a warm you have an adversary

600
00:40:12,490 --> 00:40:18,170
or you have an application go unmet okay
so this is a a good way of actually

601
00:40:18,170 --> 00:40:19,030
getting

602
00:40:19,030 --> 00:40:22,099
some up front tying into I

603
00:40:22,099 --> 00:40:27,569
respond to something like this we also
have large networks and if they're

604
00:40:27,569 --> 00:40:28,549
scarcely

605
00:40:28,549 --> 00:40:31,730
assigned their large enough where it

606
00:40:31,730 --> 00:40:35,849
is also hard to identify I especially
addresses

607
00:40:35,849 --> 00:40:40,260
that where the public addresses are not
exposed to Alan your DNS

608
00:40:40,260 --> 00:40:43,869
or not published someplace input
spreadsheet out on

609
00:40:43,869 --> 00:40:47,099
Facebook to say here's all my cool no
ipv6

610
00:40:47,099 --> 00:40:50,940
services we also have local address so
you will ace

611
00:40:50,940 --> 00:40:54,400
I am which is like it's a private
address space

612
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:58,869
I am unique local addresses they have a
real advantage

613
00:40:58,869 --> 00:41:03,309
and that is a provide you an additional
address space that is

614
00:41:03,309 --> 00:41:08,440
not Global Travel but has the ability to
be globally unique within your

615
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:09,400
infrastructure

616
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:13,329
so if you have to tie into somebody else
very quickly say

617
00:41:13,329 --> 00:41:16,589
have to throw up a VPN disconnected VPN
whatever it is

618
00:41:16,589 --> 00:41:20,259
gives the ability have very quick round
building be able to apply security

619
00:41:20,260 --> 00:41:21,339
controls

620
00:41:21,339 --> 00:41:25,740
on really well we've also seen research
on identity-based

621
00:41:25,740 --> 00:41:29,250
Internet Protocol networking where the
address itself

622
00:41:29,250 --> 00:41:33,280
contains a information about all

623
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:36,380
the device for the user on the device
for the host

624
00:41:36,380 --> 00:41:39,910
we've also seen a fast maneuvering
technique where

625
00:41:39,910 --> 00:41:43,160
if your networks being scanned

626
00:41:43,160 --> 00:41:46,990
and the adversary its predictable where
the

627
00:41:46,990 --> 00:41:52,430
stance coming to the ability for a
device to change addresses

628
00:41:52,430 --> 00:41:56,868
so that it can't be stands can from the
address space standpoint

629
00:41:56,869 --> 00:42:00,460
so this is something the more
interesting things that are taking place

630
00:42:00,460 --> 00:42:03,700
in about a cloud environment

631
00:42:03,700 --> 00:42:08,880
might be useful many cases we also have
like he sack I p sac

632
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:13,750
and the IP four domain has has 2 gateway
gateway gateway and host to host

633
00:42:13,750 --> 00:42:18,089
what we can do with ipv6 is we can
actually create a construct

634
00:42:18,089 --> 00:42:22,839
that if you've ever been through the
sure both been to a football game you

635
00:42:22,839 --> 00:42:24,470
have the first set a people

636
00:42:24,470 --> 00:42:28,900
the check you out and say air okay and
then you have to go through the

637
00:42:28,900 --> 00:42:33,619
next keeper at the tickets and then
maybe you have to go through another

638
00:42:33,619 --> 00:42:36,940
you know reviewer TSA um

639
00:42:36,940 --> 00:42:40,109
I could be six provides the ability of
having I

640
00:42:40,109 --> 00:42:43,980
chained extension headers I key sack

641
00:42:43,980 --> 00:42:48,549
so sensual you can create these enclaves
where things can become more and more

642
00:42:48,549 --> 00:42:49,440
secure

643
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:52,540
as you go into the center enclaves

644
00:42:52,540 --> 00:42:56,440
that particular technique is called a
server

645
00:42:56,440 --> 00:43:01,619
enclave Jermaine isolation I it's
available on microsoft today

646
00:43:01,619 --> 00:43:05,510
its part iv: for their products Pacers
some work being done

647
00:43:05,510 --> 00:43:10,030
ought to do that lanix also one the
other cool things specifically on IP

648
00:43:10,030 --> 00:43:12,030
second extension headers

649
00:43:12,030 --> 00:43:15,260
is I clip so clip so gives us a
capability

650
00:43:15,260 --> 00:43:19,109
we have on the stress environments to
create an extension header that

651
00:43:19,109 --> 00:43:22,109
identifies the sensitivity and the class
cation

652
00:43:22,109 --> 00:43:26,089
love a packet to the router that has the
ability to

653
00:43:26,089 --> 00:43:29,160
drop information if needed

654
00:43:29,160 --> 00:43:32,629
again another really good defensive
thing I identity management

655
00:43:32,630 --> 00:43:37,190
another extension header there is a
proposal for SCADA header

656
00:43:37,190 --> 00:43:42,720
that specifically to try to protect and
authenticate for SCADA

657
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:46,839
Rd ACP's been redone from our four
handshake to a2

658
00:43:46,839 --> 00:43:50,349
there some signing available we also
have multi cast the

659
00:43:50,349 --> 00:43:54,160
NTP now the day with a key signing

660
00:43:54,160 --> 00:43:57,670
ep also the ability to push on

661
00:43:57,670 --> 00:44:00,900
from multicast Sam point and Mallard

662
00:44:00,900 --> 00:44:04,750
a signatures so essentially all your
devices

663
00:44:04,750 --> 00:44:08,150
connect to a rendezvous point and you
can point

664
00:44:08,150 --> 00:44:13,079
are you can with one push pusher met
anti malware signatures out or maybe

665
00:44:13,079 --> 00:44:14,730
ride ES signatures

666
00:44:14,730 --> 00:44:19,000
sourcing work in that space its it's
very neat

667
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:22,150
on also the ability to leverage the

668
00:44:22,150 --> 00:44:26,190
the ability put keys in your day in a
sexy calf trusted paths

669
00:44:26,190 --> 00:44:31,230
that's another thing as many many more
things the disadvantages

670
00:44:31,230 --> 00:44:34,250
most to these our best in an ipv6

671
00:44:34,250 --> 00:44:37,500
only environment not enable stack
environment

672
00:44:37,500 --> 00:44:41,700
hunger problem

673
00:44:41,700 --> 00:44:48,700
okay tools the an- map renamed its
product to and map six actually 6.1

674
00:44:49,630 --> 00:44:53,020
I now it has the ability to do ipv6

675
00:44:53,020 --> 00:44:56,589
West scanning detection they did a great
job on that I am

676
00:44:56,589 --> 00:45:00,799
also they do room a the smart host
detection now

677
00:45:00,799 --> 00:45:04,259
so they can tell you from the outside or
the inside

678
00:45:04,260 --> 00:45:09,579
is the address wrong I am you know lots
of other things which is pretty nice

679
00:45:09,579 --> 00:45:13,119
they allow you to roll packets and now
you can script up

680
00:45:13,119 --> 00:45:16,230
an extension header five extension
headers to see what

681
00:45:16,230 --> 00:45:20,770
is happening with your product %uh the
THC toolkit

682
00:45:20,770 --> 00:45:25,200
great orchid I just been updated lots
additional tools

683
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:30,339
the Metasploit the it's pretty much ipv6
clean

684
00:45:30,339 --> 00:45:34,349
there's been a lot of contributions I've
worked with movie x2

685
00:45:34,349 --> 00:45:37,400
come up with some ideas and he's coated
the bomb

686
00:45:37,400 --> 00:45:42,390
the tools not to support to ipv6 which
is pretty cool

687
00:45:42,390 --> 00:45:46,279
and fran has also crater really nice
talk it that

688
00:45:46,279 --> 00:45:51,079
allows you to validate your flow control
and fragmentation and all these other

689
00:45:51,079 --> 00:45:51,970
things

690
00:45:51,970 --> 00:45:55,380
sick actually fuzzies to see if your
router switches

691
00:45:55,380 --> 00:45:59,270
you know hosts operating systems and

692
00:45:59,270 --> 00:46:06,270
will a will flip over and die or
continue working

693
00:46:08,099 --> 00:46:12,119
okay places to look if you decide you
want to look for

694
00:46:12,119 --> 00:46:18,150
ipv6 homebuilders

695
00:46:18,150 --> 00:46:19,319
good

696
00:46:19,319 --> 00:46:23,550
I am individual specifications I going
take a look

697
00:46:23,550 --> 00:46:29,170
at the RF sees that are out there the
final lot times there's discussion on

698
00:46:29,170 --> 00:46:30,569
potential for Billys

699
00:46:30,569 --> 00:46:34,970
I also IEEE specs are you may or may not
be aware of it

700
00:46:34,970 --> 00:46:38,880
a ipv6 is now being defined as the

701
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:43,630
I default internet protocol for

702
00:46:43,630 --> 00:46:47,160
cars for home devices

703
00:46:47,160 --> 00:46:50,839
for health care for a lotta

704
00:46:50,839 --> 00:46:54,200
other technologies to do and and up

705
00:46:54,200 --> 00:46:58,500
using these got several gateways for it
so be aware that this is a

706
00:46:58,500 --> 00:47:01,619
real interesting also interactions
between RCA's

707
00:47:01,619 --> 00:47:06,930
and discovered specific all one RC will
say something and other RC will say

708
00:47:06,930 --> 00:47:08,348
something and by

709
00:47:08,349 --> 00:47:12,099
thinking through that you can find
conflicting

710
00:47:12,099 --> 00:47:16,440
issues that can cause opportunities also
the implementation

711
00:47:16,440 --> 00:47:19,809
a lot of vendors don't fully implement
the

712
00:47:19,809 --> 00:47:23,540
ipv6 backs they may fully implement

713
00:47:23,540 --> 00:47:27,259
its back or they could do

714
00:47:27,260 --> 00:47:30,440
only the most social ads or

715
00:47:30,440 --> 00:47:35,829
should pluses are must pluses they may
also decide to change is an example if I

716
00:47:35,829 --> 00:47:36,619
manage a

717
00:47:36,619 --> 00:47:41,089
for Microsoft they justify changing the
ability of

718
00:47:41,089 --> 00:47:44,960
a Microsoft all box to respond to a pain

719
00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:48,319
I am FF 02

720
00:47:48,319 --> 00:47:53,558
concall want to be able to come back
with addressed to say that it exists

721
00:47:53,559 --> 00:47:56,849
they've modified their stackin justified
that

722
00:47:56,849 --> 00:48:01,510
said that if anybody was to do this is
puts our system's interest to be

723
00:48:01,510 --> 00:48:05,829
detected so they've actually change it
fortunately

724
00:48:05,829 --> 00:48:09,420
the it was discovered

725
00:48:09,420 --> 00:48:13,710
not by myself that the ability for one
single extension header

726
00:48:13,710 --> 00:48:18,170
in that paying allowed you to get around
that issue so

727
00:48:18,170 --> 00:48:22,190
now you can play a specific extension
header extension header 35

728
00:48:22,190 --> 00:48:26,569
and then still do the paying and
magically all your Microsoft boxes will

729
00:48:26,569 --> 00:48:27,329
still respond

730
00:48:27,329 --> 00:48:32,859
on configuration implementation again
people will

731
00:48:32,859 --> 00:48:36,279
miss configurable implementation I

732
00:48:36,280 --> 00:48:40,280
NetWitness great product wonderful
products

733
00:48:40,280 --> 00:48:44,059
just the formation at the IP addresses

734
00:48:44,059 --> 00:48:47,290
were flipped around and several
different versions over the years now

735
00:48:47,290 --> 00:48:48,380
you can get real

736
00:48:48,380 --> 00:48:51,420
the address is work after you know
poking at them

737
00:48:51,420 --> 00:48:55,559
I operational experience like people
don't have operational experience like

738
00:48:55,559 --> 00:48:56,400
PB sex

739
00:48:56,400 --> 00:49:00,940
arm talk to the people that have the
most experience they can teach you a lot

740
00:49:00,940 --> 00:49:01,890
a lessons

741
00:49:01,890 --> 00:49:06,069
those that don't I they don't
implemented correctly I just had to deal

742
00:49:06,069 --> 00:49:06,849
with the

743
00:49:06,849 --> 00:49:10,349
an issue of the appropriate address on
the Gateway

744
00:49:10,349 --> 00:49:14,619
for devices well if you inappropriately

745
00:49:14,619 --> 00:49:18,750
address it it provides a

746
00:49:18,750 --> 00:49:22,730
ok opportunity to take the CPU on your

747
00:49:22,730 --> 00:49:26,460
upstream router and bring to a higher
percent great if you're well game

748
00:49:26,460 --> 00:49:30,700
I am one of the problems is that

749
00:49:30,700 --> 00:49:34,069
it also will fill up the neighbor cache

750
00:49:34,069 --> 00:49:37,410
the table and cause assist in a crash

751
00:49:37,410 --> 00:49:40,629
so is actually two attacks within that
space right now

752
00:49:40,630 --> 00:49:43,920
I am also training material

753
00:49:43,920 --> 00:49:47,450
have won the more interesting things
ever on a crossed well let me ask a

754
00:49:47,450 --> 00:49:52,740
question the the group is it okay if the
rest the world knows what your

755
00:49:52,740 --> 00:49:56,940
the lawn construction s so OK

756
00:49:56,940 --> 00:50:01,410
is that and no yes all there's a
well-known vendor in their training

757
00:50:01,410 --> 00:50:03,098
material that states that

758
00:50:03,099 --> 00:50:07,900
you should really encode the deal an
address

759
00:50:07,900 --> 00:50:13,309
in your addresses Troy routing
infrastructure could this be good

760
00:50:13,309 --> 00:50:17,299
that's up to your policy an ass up to

761
00:50:17,299 --> 00:50:20,650
you know your paranoia but tell be aware

762
00:50:20,650 --> 00:50:24,640
we're seeing this on a regular basis I
read a lot of other people's training

763
00:50:24,640 --> 00:50:25,618
material in its

764
00:50:25,619 --> 00:50:31,569
it's pretty fun to do on also
integration with other systems

765
00:50:31,569 --> 00:50:35,200
although a lot of devices are tested for

766
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:38,470
the ability to followed the spec

767
00:50:38,470 --> 00:50:42,890
and BT and are operated a lot of don't
have the ability or haven't been tested

768
00:50:42,890 --> 00:50:43,270
for

769
00:50:43,270 --> 00:50:48,500
performance I I know won the PIAA that I
did some testing on a while back

770
00:50:48,500 --> 00:50:52,530
that it worked wonderfully at

771
00:50:52,530 --> 00:50:55,849
100 megabit life is good

772
00:50:55,849 --> 00:51:02,410
less a fragmented packets and I could
only get about $6 K through the device

773
00:51:02,410 --> 00:51:05,529
okay there was a reworked it had to be
done but

774
00:51:05,530 --> 00:51:10,240
be aware that we're seeing that kinda
thing and we're also saying things where

775
00:51:10,240 --> 00:51:11,390
they're not aware

776
00:51:11,390 --> 00:51:14,390
love how they've configure their
products

777
00:51:14,390 --> 00:51:18,779
so again they can cause problems and
also your policies procedures practices

778
00:51:18,780 --> 00:51:20,589
testing

779
00:51:20,589 --> 00:51:23,619
I am again a big problem

780
00:51:23,619 --> 00:51:28,660
I am while back the policy for

781
00:51:28,660 --> 00:51:34,109
the credit card processing systems
required at all your networks had Matt

782
00:51:34,109 --> 00:51:39,609
was hard to the specification therefore
kinda precluded the use of ipv6

783
00:51:39,609 --> 00:51:43,348
that changed a little bit over a year
ago

784
00:51:43,349 --> 00:51:48,069
when I am but we're also seeing a lot of
other procedures and practices that have

785
00:51:48,069 --> 00:51:50,720
to change in your environment

786
00:51:50,720 --> 00:51:55,799
I am some the issues that are also all
still on the table was resilient to

787
00:51:55,799 --> 00:51:56,650
attack

788
00:51:56,650 --> 00:52:01,650
and we haven't seen I've been tracking
ipv6 attacks

789
00:52:01,650 --> 00:52:05,510
for fourteen years now

790
00:52:05,510 --> 00:52:08,589
and we haven't seen a lot of amend the
the

791
00:52:08,589 --> 00:52:11,859
news mostly because people don't have
sensors

792
00:52:11,859 --> 00:52:16,020
or not aware that they're running a IQ
600 infrastructure

793
00:52:16,020 --> 00:52:19,339
it's not uncommon for somebody you
something like

794
00:52:19,339 --> 00:52:23,180
gogo net I which is one of the tunnel
providers

795
00:52:23,180 --> 00:52:26,900
at a individual the company

796
00:52:26,900 --> 00:52:31,190
loader on your system but Miss configure
it is so it turns into the default

797
00:52:31,190 --> 00:52:32,520
router

798
00:52:32,520 --> 00:52:36,520
and do it at home and then bring it into
the data center to troubleshoot the

799
00:52:36,520 --> 00:52:39,509
network and suddenly all they see is

800
00:52:39,510 --> 00:52:44,109
I don't know you need he whatever packet
RTCP in all their

801
00:52:44,109 --> 00:52:47,520
outbound connections are only

802
00:52:47,520 --> 00:52:51,609
tunnel connections they see no HTTP they
see nothing else

803
00:52:51,609 --> 00:52:54,869
arm this is a common problem and

804
00:52:54,869 --> 00:52:58,910
that I see right now a we also see

805
00:52:58,910 --> 00:53:04,319
the attack tools really on are on parity
with what we have an ipv4 divan

806
00:53:04,319 --> 00:53:08,270
there a lot tools within as example back
strap that have been updated need to be

807
00:53:08,270 --> 00:53:09,480
cross coded

808
00:53:09,480 --> 00:53:10,000
an

809
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:13,160
and some others actually a former
abilities in and that you have to be

810
00:53:13,160 --> 00:53:15,490
careful love this they're running with
ipv6

811
00:53:15,490 --> 00:53:18,530
and again there's bag loads a

812
00:53:18,530 --> 00:53:21,850
vulnerabilities and bugs to be disclosed
to me it's it's wonderful

813
00:53:21,850 --> 00:53:26,890
%uh some the devices firewalls IDS is
IPS is penetration testing tools for

814
00:53:26,890 --> 00:53:29,120
Billy susman scanning audits

815
00:53:29,120 --> 00:53:32,630
Sams we found one well-known Sam

816
00:53:32,630 --> 00:53:36,220
that wasn't providing a for like 86
address

817
00:53:36,220 --> 00:53:40,420
with its trying to use the brand names

818
00:53:40,420 --> 00:53:45,060
a connector

819
00:53:45,060 --> 00:53:50,720
I guess that it was only providing
32bits the 128 bits

820
00:53:50,720 --> 00:53:54,270
upstream therefore it always look like
it was a wrong address

821
00:53:54,270 --> 00:53:59,650
I am as I love last week it still
occurring and we've asked the vendors

822
00:53:59,650 --> 00:54:00,230
fix it

823
00:54:00,230 --> 00:54:06,500
and a lot a wireless access points don't
support ipv6 a have to be upgraded lot

824
00:54:06,500 --> 00:54:06,760
of

825
00:54:06,760 --> 00:54:10,250
protection things like that the have to
be upgraded

826
00:54:10,250 --> 00:54:13,950
I know one I D S IPS solution

827
00:54:13,950 --> 00:54:17,270
in only provided the ability I love

828
00:54:17,270 --> 00:54:21,060
stopping seven types of attacks

829
00:54:21,060 --> 00:54:24,340
you couldn't put a 8 signature on the
device

830
00:54:24,340 --> 00:54:27,370
okay so again

831
00:54:27,370 --> 00:54:30,759
be aware that these are real issues I am

832
00:54:30,760 --> 00:54:35,270
also you have to secure Tweaker security
policies now if you're

833
00:54:35,270 --> 00:54:38,880
putting firewall policy on you're gonna
put it on twice

834
00:54:38,880 --> 00:54:43,180
make sure it's configured correct or
maybe three times if you're using

835
00:54:43,180 --> 00:54:47,090
unique local and also global addresses I

836
00:54:47,090 --> 00:54:50,390
it's an issue an app to deal with the

837
00:54:50,390 --> 00:54:54,160
also compliant standards make sure that
your compliance autres know what the

838
00:54:54,160 --> 00:54:56,839
heck's going on you know how to actually
tweak those

839
00:54:56,840 --> 00:55:02,760
at education the girly administrators in
the world like to

840
00:55:02,760 --> 00:55:05,770
point-and-click and

841
00:55:05,770 --> 00:55:09,070
based on which vendor using

842
00:55:09,070 --> 00:55:14,260
ipv6 fully is ingly compatible this
point law the interfaces are broke

843
00:55:14,260 --> 00:55:17,560
on his example Microsoft 2003 if you're

844
00:55:17,560 --> 00:55:21,340
running at all the plumbing is there

845
00:55:21,340 --> 00:55:24,900
but there's nowhere really communicating
in managing it easily

846
00:55:24,900 --> 00:55:30,480
and you'll find that it is a real pain
are some things you really can't do so

847
00:55:30,480 --> 00:55:35,220
forces you to upgrade so those are the
kinda lessons I've learned over the

848
00:55:35,220 --> 00:55:40,580
over the years I education get those
people train on ipv6

849
00:55:40,580 --> 00:55:45,110
because they'll make many mistakes by
trainer engineers technicians and debt

850
00:55:45,110 --> 00:55:46,720
definitely security personnel

851
00:55:46,720 --> 00:55:52,470
get them out there and trained I again
the ipv4 mindset shouldn't lead into the

852
00:55:52,470 --> 00:55:54,020
ipv6 environment

853
00:55:54,020 --> 00:55:57,230
it's a it's a different mindset on how
things are working

854
00:55:57,230 --> 00:56:00,840
I and your developers get your
developers

855
00:56:00,840 --> 00:56:05,180
upgraded make sure your libraries are
supporting ipv6 fully

856
00:56:05,180 --> 00:56:08,550
and it's very important

857
00:56:08,550 --> 00:56:13,730
questions yes I wanted to end with a
bang

858
00:56:13,730 --> 00:56:20,730
sir

859
00:56:58,940 --> 00:57:01,910
can I suggest that you take a look at
the upcoming II

860
00:57:01,910 --> 00:57:07,490
ipv6 the CIO document om includes a
whole section on just cloud and some the

861
00:57:07,490 --> 00:57:08,540
issues with cloud

862
00:57:08,540 --> 00:57:12,900
calm and also cloud security and how the
federal government ceilings clouded

863
00:57:12,900 --> 00:57:16,930
point you the fed ramps of butter talk
specifically on

864
00:57:16,930 --> 00:57:20,810
ipv6 issues or in get hold of me at

865
00:57:20,810 --> 00:57:24,690
my blog

866
00:57:24,690 --> 00:57:31,690
any other questions sir

867
00:57:35,980 --> 00:57:37,010
the gateways

868
00:57:37,010 --> 00:57:40,930
arm a lot of people say that mostly it's
a decision

869
00:57:40,930 --> 00:57:45,370
from a financial standpoint arm one
other lessons that the federal

870
00:57:45,370 --> 00:57:46,290
government's learned

871
00:57:46,290 --> 00:57:50,130
is screening the procurement policy and
then

872
00:57:50,130 --> 00:57:53,350
over time making sure everything from
that day forward is definitely

873
00:57:53,350 --> 00:57:55,480
supporting ipv6 therefore your

874
00:57:55,480 --> 00:57:58,820
network is ready overtime to be able to
enable go

875
00:57:58,820 --> 00:58:03,300
for some organizations it may be 2020
before you completely native

876
00:58:03,300 --> 00:58:07,120
v6 intern or 2025 based on your

877
00:58:07,120 --> 00:58:12,299
refresh cycle by it you have to do it
and have to really get down to

878
00:58:12,300 --> 00:58:16,360
for procurement policy and trainers
people deal with it otherwise you'll end

879
00:58:16,360 --> 00:58:17,260
up with

880
00:58:17,260 --> 00:58:20,740
medical equipment that doesn't support
ipv6

881
00:58:20,740 --> 00:58:24,510
that you want to use all the new
features on ipv6 from a security or

882
00:58:24,510 --> 00:58:25,130
whatever

883
00:58:25,130 --> 00:58:28,650
and then have to have individual
translators

884
00:58:28,650 --> 00:58:32,750
on every single Ethernet work-rate the
Lancers toll completely

885
00:58:32,750 --> 00:58:36,650
isolated from everything else arm a lot
more management headache

886
00:58:36,650 --> 00:58:39,860
the other questions

887
00:58:39,860 --> 00:58:43,900
as my blog these will be posted tomorrow
morning

888
00:58:43,900 --> 00:58:48,280
om I have a lot of videos ok sorry you
were in the light

889
00:58:48,280 --> 00:58:55,280
home go ahead

890
00:59:02,410 --> 00:59:07,939
GE's NetFlow okay

891
00:59:07,939 --> 00:59:11,189
one other wonderful things about having
and and connections

892
00:59:11,189 --> 00:59:14,649
expecially if their devices that are

893
00:59:14,650 --> 00:59:18,599
depending on how their configured keep
track at that

894
00:59:18,599 --> 00:59:22,949
because what you can do is it the last
64 bits is the

895
00:59:22,949 --> 00:59:27,019
by: you can use that to determine what
brand it is

896
00:59:27,019 --> 00:59:31,910
and use the a second part of it for the
proximate Asia

897
00:59:31,910 --> 00:59:35,308
how long it's been there which is really
nice on

898
00:59:35,309 --> 00:59:39,239
if it's not it's probably a Microsoft
device with some Cana random-urs has

899
00:59:39,239 --> 00:59:40,739
privacy addresses on

900
00:59:40,739 --> 00:59:44,539
I'm also that at least gives you what
your upstream

901
00:59:44,539 --> 00:59:49,839
devices she can find that you can trace
route to it and find out what that

902
00:59:49,839 --> 00:59:53,739
upstream devices effort a router there's
a good chance it's a well-known

903
00:59:53,739 --> 00:59:59,739
on endpoint makes really nice for
intrusion detection and identifying and

904
00:59:59,739 --> 01:00:01,019
points very quickly

905
01:00:01,019 --> 01:00:05,630
om through environment kind of allows
you to find the hidden

906
01:00:05,630 --> 01:00:09,829
IT infrastructures that exists in every
organization very quickly

907
01:00:09,829 --> 01:00:14,400
so net flows a good solution or if you
have the ability to do the upstream

908
01:00:14,400 --> 01:00:18,829
on SNMP the v3 just

909
01:00:18,829 --> 01:00:21,989
look for the mac Address is look for the
other information

910
01:00:21,989 --> 01:00:25,339
make sure the switch supports ipv6

911
01:00:25,339 --> 01:00:32,339
the other questions

912
01:00:55,050 --> 01:00:57,030
the a good reference

913
01:00:57,030 --> 01:01:01,480
is if you go to 80% done at hurricane
electric

914
01:01:01,480 --> 01:01:08,140
they have a really base course on ipv6
it's really about setting up your home

915
01:01:08,140 --> 01:01:09,020
computer

916
01:01:09,020 --> 01:01:12,320
and your home servers to be able to row

917
01:01:12,320 --> 01:01:16,990
ipv6 to be able to deal with the
addressing issue to configure DNS

918
01:01:16,990 --> 01:01:20,270
configure your external facing devices

919
01:01:20,270 --> 01:01:23,520
it's a good kick start I also

920
01:01:23,520 --> 01:01:28,000
law stuff on you too I my blog
everything I can find on throwing up on

921
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:30,480
that and referencing other training
material

922
01:01:30,480 --> 01:01:33,900
the EU has some training material out
there there's

923
01:01:33,900 --> 01:01:38,880
the lotsa people talking about it at
this point especially

924
01:01:38,880 --> 01:01:43,930
and the a the at Nick world

925
01:01:43,930 --> 01:01:46,940
and in Europe there's a lot of
communications Kyle

926
01:01:46,940 --> 01:01:50,070
ipv6 a light training natural it's free

927
01:01:50,070 --> 01:01:54,570
so and then you have santini have Cisco
and Juniper and

928
01:01:54,570 --> 01:01:58,599
they'll have kick-start talk it's in
such

929
01:01:58,599 --> 01:02:05,599
any other questions another one in the
light

930
01:02:23,880 --> 01:02:27,800
yes when you're running dual stack when
