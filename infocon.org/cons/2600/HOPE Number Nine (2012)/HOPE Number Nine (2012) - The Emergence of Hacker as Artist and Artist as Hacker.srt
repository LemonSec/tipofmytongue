1
00:00:01,750 --> 00:00:03,370
this is not conscious and sacking

2
00:00:03,370 --> 00:00:10,370
so hi everyone thanks for coming

3
00:00:10,599 --> 00:00:15,940
arm my name's cantors on and this is a
panel discussion about

4
00:00:15,940 --> 00:00:20,680
how hackers are becoming artists and how
hackers

5
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:25,000
artists are becoming hackers and vice
versa

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,689
so i'd like entries my panel this is a

7
00:00:28,689 --> 00:00:34,630
Catherine Bennett Chris Thompson

8
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:37,719
and William chrome are and I'm gonna

9
00:00:37,719 --> 00:00:40,960
I am have them introduce themselves and
a

10
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:45,800
if you could just briefly tell us or not
so briefly tell us about

11
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:49,280
what you make in your are

12
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:52,510
what you hack in your art and

13
00:00:52,510 --> 00:00:56,390
who you are where you're from prospect

14
00:00:56,390 --> 00:01:03,390
hi my name is Catherine

15
00:01:03,469 --> 00:01:08,350
I come from a and actual artist
background I started out

16
00:01:08,350 --> 00:01:13,610
and sculpture and I came to technology
because I was working with lights and I

17
00:01:13,610 --> 00:01:15,670
wanted to do more things with lights

18
00:01:15,670 --> 00:01:20,130
so it's a really gradual call even
though my father and my brothers are all

19
00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:21,369
engineers and

20
00:01:21,369 --> 00:01:25,619
their Hall had computers going all the
time in around the Thanksgiving table we

21
00:01:25,619 --> 00:01:26,759
always talked about like

22
00:01:26,759 --> 00:01:31,090
internet all kinds of technological
things my mother and I

23
00:01:31,090 --> 00:01:37,150
really he did that but as time wore on
in my practice and I start I wanted to

24
00:01:37,150 --> 00:01:41,960
do things more with lights I got into
timing and sensors and then went into

25
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:45,750
control them on my own instead of having
to work with engineers so I really

26
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:48,780
wanted independence with that so

27
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:52,070
I kinda hacked into it that way if you
could say

28
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:55,820
rather than like coming from like a
straight technological like background

29
00:01:55,820 --> 00:02:00,040
but now I do all kinds of things like
I'm working with Astrix hands

30
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:03,509
you know working with Mike website
saying PHP and

31
00:02:03,509 --> 00:02:08,770
all kinds of fun things alone

32
00:02:08,770 --> 00:02:12,870
Chris Thompson on II got a a degree

33
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:17,060
and designers from Lehigh University and
their I took a class called

34
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:20,280
image in process as our which kinda got
me into

35
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:23,540
the are making a do today

36
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:28,010
I'm I ruined digital images with
pixelation corruption and

37
00:02:28,010 --> 00:02:32,019
and a to stir now background in
Photoshop

38
00:02:32,019 --> 00:02:35,150
and and more recently I've been doing

39
00:02:35,150 --> 00:02:38,890
3d printing and trying to 3d print some

40
00:02:38,890 --> 00:02:41,950
interesting things no success on that
yet

41
00:02:41,950 --> 00:02:47,120
test

42
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:49,770
out I'm I Philadelphia

43
00:02:49,770 --> 00:02:53,720
and I'm board member at high 76

44
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:57,099
hackerspace their am and for

45
00:02:57,099 --> 00:03:01,390
money I designed a clock that has map on
the dial

46
00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:04,680
can I sell that summit is actually

47
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:07,700
successfully so that's why my bread and
butter

48
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:11,540
is how long enough very short parking
lot

49
00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:14,730
okay ago in

50
00:03:14,730 --> 00:03:18,500
Anderson don't be short has no idea what
he's in for now

51
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:23,870
arm assigned 0 chrome RI I'm gonna
represent two things here today one is

52
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:30,250
arm I am are running a new media program
in New new media program at Penn State

53
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:31,840
Abington which is a small

54
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:35,730
on non-university park-based to a

55
00:03:35,730 --> 00:03:38,880
part and stay so we're not really
involve much with

56
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:43,549
the scandal um but I'm also part of
what's called

57
00:03:43,549 --> 00:03:48,260
group called tension and tension is
really a little bit like

58
00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:52,880
a band God sculptor we've got me I do a
lot of video work

59
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:56,480
are but I also have a sculpture
background I don't know what it's about

60
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:57,690
sculptors

61
00:03:57,690 --> 00:04:01,230
becoming the sort of technology people
but it seems to be in the air

62
00:04:01,230 --> 00:04:05,140
arm but we have a photographer musician
and

63
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:09,140
you know nobody steps on each other's
toes everybody kind of a

64
00:04:09,140 --> 00:04:12,310
does what the to but we do it

65
00:04:12,310 --> 00:04:15,850
kind even as a as a non-hierarchical
team

66
00:04:15,850 --> 00:04:18,918
'em chunk of my work are

67
00:04:18,918 --> 00:04:23,289
was in the art space that was down
stairs up by the escalators and

68
00:04:23,289 --> 00:04:26,599
Andrews got something in there too and I
don't know you guys have anything in

69
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:26,870
there

70
00:04:26,870 --> 00:04:30,470
none market you should was awesome

71
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:34,340
arm but to that's kind of

72
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:39,360
what I do if that's enough better be

73
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:44,220
I am interests on I'm marrying this
panel

74
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:49,350
and I I would say I'm an artist
multi-media artist

75
00:04:49,350 --> 00:04:53,820
and last year I organize a juried
exhibition for

76
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:57,110
hacker spaces and Philadelphia has
called happily

77
00:04:57,110 --> 00:05:01,590
and that's kinda have this panel came to
be this is the second iteration of the

78
00:05:01,590 --> 00:05:02,110
panel

79
00:05:02,110 --> 00:05:05,800
I with new panelists and they're much
more fancy

80
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:09,820
I would say not that there's anything
wrong with the other pair

81
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:13,570
but I am you missed the cut

82
00:05:13,570 --> 00:05:19,349
so I wanna talk a little bit about

83
00:05:19,349 --> 00:05:23,870
com who who are some other influences

84
00:05:23,870 --> 00:05:28,510
an arm art and technology and how did
you

85
00:05:28,510 --> 00:05:34,460
arm kinda get to this point arm

86
00:05:34,460 --> 00:05:39,159
there whether the conventional or
unconventional influences

87
00:05:39,159 --> 00:05:43,620
om Catherine

88
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:49,690
just I I think it had something

89
00:05:49,690 --> 00:05:53,820
um influences com

90
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:57,000
and doing stuff that I have been seen
before

91
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,020
have seen some glitch are in the past
and I'm

92
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:04,030
some contemporaries but my and that the
stuff they really got me

93
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:08,039
interested in that sort of glitchy a
static is mistakes

94
00:06:08,039 --> 00:06:11,870
so my influences when the cable goes out
for a second

95
00:06:11,870 --> 00:06:15,520
and the compression gets lost her key
frames are missing um

96
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:19,890
trying to think of um I

97
00:06:19,890 --> 00:06:23,460
older pieces that I on I'm

98
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:27,330
I'm blanking a comeback to that hear
anything cancer

99
00:06:27,330 --> 00:06:31,680
I mean it so are the only things I mean
cuz I started out

100
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:35,880
from this really in sculpture and I
really had no idea what you kid

101
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:41,229
do a technology at that point missus I
mean I'm talking you know like 10-15

102
00:06:41,229 --> 00:06:44,409
years ago so like looking at work like
really a Parker

103
00:06:44,409 --> 00:06:48,070
you know and she is exploding shedding
interests you seen

104
00:06:48,070 --> 00:06:52,870
using technology with an american a very
simple sense

105
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:57,050
to me that that really started to
suggest like more ideas from myself

106
00:06:57,050 --> 00:06:57,860
personally

107
00:06:57,860 --> 00:07:04,860
suppose as far as influences might be
concerned

108
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:10,090
I think Kurt engine takes a lot of our
are a lot of pages at the PlayBook if

109
00:07:10,090 --> 00:07:10,490
Tony

110
00:07:10,490 --> 00:07:14,639
were slurred if you're familiar with his
work what he kind of does is he'll

111
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:18,080
develop some sort of sculptural object
and project

112
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:21,430
onto that so it's not just a kind of
flat

113
00:07:21,430 --> 00:07:24,669
on the wall environment he'll use mask

114
00:07:24,669 --> 00:07:28,099
22 kind of defeat the rectangular

115
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:31,380
box the projection Hill Hill la

116
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:35,830
use our multiple projectors coming from
various sources hill at

117
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:39,758
sound sir to really multimedia kinda
experience

118
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:44,160
are I think we certainly I'll
acknowledged tony's

119
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:47,599
work arm coming for hours

120
00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:50,930
I think the difference with us is that
we're really interested in this idea of

121
00:07:50,930 --> 00:07:52,370
taking stuff

122
00:07:52,370 --> 00:07:56,990
are that's kind of out love public

123
00:07:56,990 --> 00:08:00,139
environment of places like YouTube
Irvine mio

124
00:08:00,139 --> 00:08:04,330
are Andriod app ting interchanging it
you know can have matching it up and

125
00:08:04,330 --> 00:08:07,949
transforming it so I think we're kinda
transformative

126
00:08:07,949 --> 00:08:13,710
artists in that sense it's not something
that only does

127
00:08:13,710 --> 00:08:17,780
okay thank you arm so I want to talk
about

128
00:08:17,780 --> 00:08:20,990
I am today and at what what

129
00:08:20,990 --> 00:08:25,930
are you what are you are using I am
currently today what interests you

130
00:08:25,930 --> 00:08:29,160
II today and technology an art

131
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:32,589
IOM E

132
00:08:32,589 --> 00:08:35,360
what do you see is is the cutting edge
dead

133
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:38,870
the trends are what are you currently
using

134
00:08:38,870 --> 00:08:42,320
com bad is new

135
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:49,320
Catherine in brief us on these questions
on any answers for you

136
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:53,870
never we're really going office here

137
00:08:53,870 --> 00:08:57,260
I'm plan anything for me because I work
with

138
00:08:57,260 --> 00:09:00,959
for the most part I work with physical
computing and lights in electronics and

139
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:04,810
I i love working with circuits and I
love getting down in there working with

140
00:09:04,810 --> 00:09:06,730
my hands on this is a sculptor

141
00:09:06,730 --> 00:09:10,570
but some other stuff some any ideas that
I how

142
00:09:10,570 --> 00:09:14,209
of when I'm fast nearby its members with
technology

143
00:09:14,209 --> 00:09:17,410
as how they can be ratified so quickly

144
00:09:17,410 --> 00:09:22,300
I with like computer vision so something
that's something they really fascinates

145
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:22,910
me

146
00:09:22,910 --> 00:09:27,430
a the connection she and chips

147
00:09:27,430 --> 00:09:31,200
some other work that they've done with
computer vision how they can kind of

148
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:34,649
just cast light on

149
00:09:34,649 --> 00:09:38,480
and object like a plant leaves and be
able to cancel everything else out

150
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:43,620
just cause little projections on that is
so fast enough for me because if I was

151
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:46,430
to do that with actually hardware
electronics

152
00:09:46,430 --> 00:09:50,700
though took a really long time in if any
have you ever worked with hardware you

153
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:50,980
know

154
00:09:50,980 --> 00:09:54,220
the more things you got into it the more
complex it gets

155
00:09:54,220 --> 00:09:57,440
you know Eivissa like as your network
rose but when you're working with a

156
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:58,579
computer program

157
00:09:58,579 --> 00:10:02,610
not that it is a complex not that you
don't have to things that happen but

158
00:10:02,610 --> 00:10:06,180
somehow the ability to control and and
change thing is is

159
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:09,200
radically different than if you're
working out with hardware

160
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:12,480
so when I see what's coming along with
the can act

161
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:16,040
and how that's here just how to connect
was released

162
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:19,860
you know how that was made quite like
last summer

163
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:24,339
how quickly that happen you know and
open source community how much it's

164
00:10:24,339 --> 00:10:25,720
combine this year

165
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:30,120
you know how Carnegie Mellon how there
are encoded I was all about computer

166
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:30,670
vision

167
00:10:30,670 --> 00:10:37,670
is extremely exciting really excited
about Tom

168
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:41,480
open source 3d printing i'm i'm looking
for.

169
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:44,600
ways to make interesting pieces

170
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:47,940
on be set to become a sculptor and

171
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:51,800
to to do some good 3d objects yeah

172
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:56,670
um I've been using a open scattered to
make stuff but it's boring practical

173
00:10:56,670 --> 00:10:57,329
stuff in

174
00:10:57,329 --> 00:11:00,779
and a I'm stepping into learning I wanna

175
00:11:00,779 --> 00:11:05,380
gonna make something that looks
interesting in entirely impractical

176
00:11:05,380 --> 00:11:09,040
and they're probably need to learn
blender to on

177
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:14,689
looks interesting

178
00:11:14,690 --> 00:11:20,029
I mean just tactile I'm

179
00:11:20,029 --> 00:11:23,270
I'm just asking him in a kiss for me I'm
always interested in

180
00:11:23,270 --> 00:11:27,720
and the physical and some people are
very virtual and so when you say it it

181
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:28,199
looks

182
00:11:28,199 --> 00:11:31,930
interesting is that it said something
that needs to be tactile

183
00:11:31,930 --> 00:11:35,850
its at work interest you or is it
actually as it is a token of

184
00:11:35,850 --> 00:11:40,520
I

185
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:45,110
the stuff I make is is a

186
00:11:45,110 --> 00:11:49,160
the three studs it's not it's not a
useful

187
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:52,410
I wanna want to make something that's
not useful

188
00:11:52,410 --> 00:11:56,959
on so you can pick up these objects you
can

189
00:11:56,959 --> 00:12:01,300
you can mess up and they're they're
interesting when they break as well

190
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:08,300
on the phone and you hung percent so it
sounds like you're asking between

191
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:15,779
the the purpose in the object right
because sometimes you know you can make

192
00:12:15,779 --> 00:12:16,660
something

193
00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:20,910
and its it's something that you can see
versus something that you can actually

194
00:12:20,910 --> 00:12:23,620
touching interact with perhaps around
the body

195
00:12:23,620 --> 00:12:26,640
like I'm I'm very interested like like

196
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:31,110
a installation sequence around your body
and actually surround your body with

197
00:12:31,110 --> 00:12:34,050
objects you can like actually turn
around look behind you and there's

198
00:12:34,050 --> 00:12:38,250
something behind you can exactly do that
with a projection into it it's

199
00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:41,890
gets mismatch and stuff like that or

200
00:12:41,890 --> 00:12:44,949
is it with trading and object

201
00:12:44,949 --> 00:12:49,240
yes a few create like a fork fork is
something that has a dedicated purpose

202
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:50,650
and something that you can use

203
00:12:50,650 --> 00:12:53,990
like this is that sort of like tactility
your after

204
00:12:53,990 --> 00:12:59,480
or said I think it's more on the
tactility say cuz I can

205
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:02,500
I can only print stuff this big so um

206
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:05,779
needs to be an interesting object that
in a

207
00:13:05,779 --> 00:13:09,040
you can pick up until around have ideas
for

208
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:12,099
larger immersive pieces but I'm

209
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:16,470
I don't know where but that's gonna go I
have a have one idea for a

210
00:13:16,470 --> 00:13:19,850
arm a wall clocks that

211
00:13:19,850 --> 00:13:24,089
take in a psycho every second so the one
from the techs

212
00:13:24,089 --> 00:13:27,760
and the next one and then all these two
trannies have this

213
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:31,660
cacophony of sound but that's an earlier

214
00:13:31,660 --> 00:13:36,089
pretty printed a interesting

215
00:13:36,089 --> 00:13:39,199
like you can't have everything your I

216
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:43,370
%uh today for well one of the things
that we started playing with

217
00:13:43,370 --> 00:13:47,250
a couple years ago was in a ser scanning

218
00:13:47,250 --> 00:13:50,449
arm technologies things like

219
00:13:50,449 --> 00:13:53,970
not skinning as in you know 3d

220
00:13:53,970 --> 00:13:58,680
miss scanning for 3d printing but to
things like your

221
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:02,329
are you know

222
00:14:02,329 --> 00:14:05,480
now I'm having one at this middle age
moments the

223
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:11,240
the those now now the little I'll the
little square things

224
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:14,610
you know and I'm talking about now no no

225
00:14:14,610 --> 00:14:17,699
QR code thank you rather sad

226
00:14:17,699 --> 00:14:21,410
yes so we started playing around with QR
codes a couple years ago

227
00:14:21,410 --> 00:14:25,000
arm and in the last thing the tangent
did weast

228
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,380
we were you saying arm book

229
00:14:28,380 --> 00:14:32,309
ups a skinnable are image that had all

230
00:14:32,309 --> 00:14:36,809
has a watermark embedded in it and what
we're doing is we're at linking pieces

231
00:14:36,809 --> 00:14:40,020
love the narrative love art installation

232
00:14:40,020 --> 00:14:43,290
are to web sites and

233
00:14:43,290 --> 00:14:47,990
are and videos art that could actually
start to

234
00:14:47,990 --> 00:14:51,689
be things that people could take away
they could start they could continue to

235
00:14:51,689 --> 00:14:53,390
live with the installation

236
00:14:53,390 --> 00:14:56,569
even after they left the dedicated
Artspace

237
00:14:56,569 --> 00:15:01,390
arm this is kind of a continuation of
what engines always done which is to

238
00:15:01,390 --> 00:15:02,439
kind

239
00:15:02,439 --> 00:15:05,900
provide some kind of take away or some
kind of give away

240
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:09,050
arm every you we've done everything from

241
00:15:09,050 --> 00:15:12,540
you know Phil condoms with seed corn to

242
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:16,150
you know making fake maps of
Philadelphia

243
00:15:16,150 --> 00:15:19,400
transcript people up um but

244
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:24,640
the cell these a QR codes in the sand
and most interestingly I think these

245
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:28,290
is watermarked images up to come away

246
00:15:28,290 --> 00:15:32,149
for people to take something away not
physical but virtual

247
00:15:32,149 --> 00:15:35,329
so we get both

248
00:15:35,329 --> 00:15:39,380
thank you

249
00:15:39,380 --> 00:15:43,420
see I'm gonna make this question up okay
so

250
00:15:43,420 --> 00:15:47,520
tell me I am of three view actually I'm

251
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:52,480
which and happy you

252
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:57,559
how do you label yourself how do you do
you label yourself as an artist

253
00:15:57,559 --> 00:16:00,939
as a hacker I as a human

254
00:16:00,939 --> 00:16:05,290
doesn't matter I have you come into any
problems

255
00:16:05,290 --> 00:16:09,630
and when you're in a situation you say
I'm a hacker are you say

256
00:16:09,630 --> 00:16:15,010
I'm at an artist are you saying I'm in
our city uses technology and then artist

257
00:16:15,010 --> 00:16:16,260
will say oh well

258
00:16:16,260 --> 00:16:19,500
then you're an artist or something like
this: I am

259
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:23,640
where where the hi you go against the
grain

260
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:30,640
your field said so to speak

261
00:16:31,649 --> 00:16:35,130
and customize first here away I'm

262
00:16:35,130 --> 00:16:38,760
I always have a lot of problem with this
in a Vegas I started out

263
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:43,510
and in sculpture and so on I was using
yeah I'd say I'm a sculptor that uses

264
00:16:43,510 --> 00:16:46,250
technology and this is before I really

265
00:16:46,250 --> 00:16:50,220
I was abroad for a while and relatively
under a rock

266
00:16:50,220 --> 00:16:53,550
I guess you could say you know I had no
idea what people are doing with

267
00:16:53,550 --> 00:16:57,350
activity so I talked about like
interaction

268
00:16:57,350 --> 00:17:01,660
and design in you know i'd try to talk
to other people

269
00:17:01,660 --> 00:17:06,428
it really becomes a challenge but it to
me really depends on the audience

270
00:17:06,429 --> 00:17:11,620
you know if i'm talking to a hacker in
SA someone here it's very different

271
00:17:11,620 --> 00:17:15,480
then from at another technology
conference it's very different

272
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:19,679
if I am at an art opening you know it's
very different from talking to a

273
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:20,520
grandmother

274
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:24,780
you know it it really depends how I how
I classify myself because it's

275
00:17:24,780 --> 00:17:28,889
to me it's more about communicating with
that individual on

276
00:17:28,889 --> 00:17:32,960
so it's I don't feel like I have like a
a steady label

277
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:37,050
unfortunately and maybe that's a great
thing in having it be

278
00:17:37,050 --> 00:17:41,428
something that's relatively fashion
something that's relatively evolving

279
00:17:41,429 --> 00:17:45,270
I don't think I would ever really
consider myself a hacker but the more I

280
00:17:45,270 --> 00:17:46,290
think about it

281
00:17:46,290 --> 00:17:49,740
you know over the last few months in the
more I think about like my approach to

282
00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:51,399
technology then

283
00:17:51,399 --> 00:17:54,810
some other individuals approach to
technology and being here

284
00:17:54,810 --> 00:17:59,350
it is quite different you know because I
look at technology is it as a means to

285
00:17:59,350 --> 00:18:00,270
an end

286
00:18:00,270 --> 00:18:03,408
yeah I think it's a beautiful thing when
you can achieve certain things and

287
00:18:03,409 --> 00:18:04,770
technology

288
00:18:04,770 --> 00:18:08,590
and sometimes in any kind of go along in
your on these past seven

289
00:18:08,590 --> 00:18:12,250
you know you have a call and then you
know along the way you realize his other

290
00:18:12,250 --> 00:18:13,940
things that can happen

291
00:18:13,940 --> 00:18:17,659
you realize the other possibilities are
that medium are up that language that

292
00:18:17,659 --> 00:18:18,740
you're within

293
00:18:18,740 --> 00:18:23,320
that doesn't necessarily mean that all
be married to that language for forever

294
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:27,970
probably married to that that particular
medium for forever you know because some

295
00:18:27,970 --> 00:18:31,950
I'm after a different I have a different
thing that drives me

296
00:18:31,950 --> 00:18:35,700
and some other people may so my

297
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:39,290
as a result of that I think how I label
myself tends to

298
00:18:39,290 --> 00:18:43,899
of all the bed as a result of who I'm
talking to an artist us 59

299
00:18:43,899 --> 00:18:47,190
I'm not sure scale

300
00:18:47,190 --> 00:18:52,600
I excuse myself as a product designer
usually cuz glycol what do you do

301
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:56,600
the guy I make money doing this by down

302
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:59,950
are usually a my card it says it is your
artist

303
00:18:59,950 --> 00:19:03,260
which is like a little qualifier com

304
00:19:03,260 --> 00:19:07,000
and and when I say I work at a
hackerspace

305
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:12,210
and and I use the word hacker a lot of
people outside this room like what

306
00:19:12,210 --> 00:19:15,659
see you breaking the phone lines or
something and

307
00:19:15,659 --> 00:19:18,820
and a half the get people to realize
that back

308
00:19:18,820 --> 00:19:22,240
the word hack is old and I'm doing
something

309
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:25,340
with technology that wasn't intended
psalm

310
00:19:25,340 --> 00:19:31,000
hacking is gone can and

311
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:35,840
so I mud is artist product design hacker

312
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:40,980
this is a good question um I'm kind of
thinking about it

313
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:44,090
unthinking well a text that we use

314
00:19:44,090 --> 00:19:47,300
arm in in new media to kinda

315
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:51,168
cure though people up for what they're
about to enter

316
00:19:51,169 --> 00:19:55,260
arm is Paul Graham's

317
00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:59,050
hackers and painters this wasn't article
that he wrote about her

318
00:19:59,050 --> 00:20:03,690
like an essay that era 10 about ten
years ago it's a pretty familiar with it

319
00:20:03,690 --> 00:20:07,790
arm you can find it pretty easy on
program's website

320
00:20:07,790 --> 00:20:12,418
arm and what he does is kinda
interesting and every kind of talks

321
00:20:12,419 --> 00:20:13,480
about

322
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:16,970
in even slightly more than metaphorical
ways how hackers

323
00:20:16,970 --> 00:20:21,190
are like painters and helping owners are
like akers has a pretty good sense

324
00:20:21,190 --> 00:20:24,960
he comes at it from a kind computing
perspective

325
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:29,179
he's a pretty good sense of what makes a
painter painter and how they relate

326
00:20:29,179 --> 00:20:32,690
and one of the things that he does in
there and I think this is maybe

327
00:20:32,690 --> 00:20:36,470
a 2003 so it may be made to the first
time that these

328
00:20:36,470 --> 00:20:40,820
that this kind of rhetoric is coming out
he calls them all

329
00:20:40,820 --> 00:20:44,810
makers and so now when I was talking to

330
00:20:44,810 --> 00:20:48,200
are but was talking to Andrew earlier
about plans that were making for

331
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:49,540
hackerspace

332
00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:53,690
a at Penn State Abington because we just
bought a new

333
00:20:53,690 --> 00:20:57,810
a new 10 all actually for us but a new

334
00:20:57,810 --> 00:21:03,530
and atop all arm gas not a gas station
at a car dealership so it's got this

335
00:21:03,530 --> 00:21:07,280
gigantic garage in it's perfect for
making a hackerspace

336
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:11,330
and a chancellors walking around in
there with us and we're looking at what

337
00:21:11,330 --> 00:21:15,428
a great place for hackerspace and she
looked at me like I had three heads

338
00:21:15,429 --> 00:21:19,419
a home so yeah that's that's this is
loaded language that's

339
00:21:19,419 --> 00:21:23,129
this activity that's largely
misunderstood right so I said well I

340
00:21:23,129 --> 00:21:24,600
meant to say a maker space

341
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:27,740
knowing but but Paul Graham calls
himself

342
00:21:27,740 --> 00:21:31,050
a maker in that sentence because
painters makers

343
00:21:31,050 --> 00:21:34,340
sung in a calm myself from maker

344
00:21:34,340 --> 00:21:37,840
great thank you com

345
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:42,149
so what about collaboration arm

346
00:21:42,149 --> 00:21:46,000
who've you collaborated with do you
enjoy collaborating

347
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:49,889
who you hate collaborating

348
00:21:49,889 --> 00:21:53,879
do you like working on your own IOM

349
00:21:53,879 --> 00:21:57,889
what come down to cooperation within the
context

350
00:21:57,889 --> 00:22:04,889
of art and technology

351
00:22:04,889 --> 00:22:08,040
onto first a

352
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:11,240
all I don't collaborate on my heart to
someone else a stupid

353
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:14,780
and i cant do our a look with someone
else

354
00:22:14,780 --> 00:22:17,860
I'm trying to think Ive good projects

355
00:22:17,860 --> 00:22:21,870
outside my dizzle are tatters included
someone else

356
00:22:21,870 --> 00:22:26,800
on there's a lot of clever project to
happen at high 76

357
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:31,340
com turn and the related to are within a
nice thing a passenger

358
00:22:31,340 --> 00:22:36,240
I wasn't included in and

359
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:39,850
now now it's fine II excluding myself um

360
00:22:39,850 --> 00:22:42,960
the a lot %uh the boring work

361
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:46,399
at highs is collaborative and then
people do

362
00:22:46,399 --> 00:22:50,770
individual projects like all ball make a
3d printer and then something on Google

363
00:22:50,770 --> 00:22:51,860
print something

364
00:22:51,860 --> 00:22:56,810
on the USB typewriter was it's like one
guy's project but I rouse were helped

365
00:22:56,810 --> 00:22:57,610
out

366
00:22:57,610 --> 00:23:01,909
on I wonder what a collaborative

367
00:23:01,909 --> 00:23:05,639
our project and have a look like that
would be any good

368
00:23:05,639 --> 00:23:09,860
kazi are usually the the auditorium
working by myself

369
00:23:09,860 --> 00:23:13,429
and I have not made any collaborative
art ever

370
00:23:13,429 --> 00:23:17,270
so I with Ana to do list

371
00:23:17,270 --> 00:23:20,750
her am

372
00:23:20,750 --> 00:23:24,770
I regis you know I'll be honest I've
I've never really works on a

373
00:23:24,770 --> 00:23:28,980
collaborative project with in my
practice and I think that's a resolve

374
00:23:28,980 --> 00:23:33,500
how I work and how I envision things I
mean usually I have a vision

375
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:37,490
how things should work and then I try to
find a friend

376
00:23:37,490 --> 00:23:41,540
technology a different means they're to
ratify that idea

377
00:23:41,540 --> 00:23:44,928
as close to how I see that coming to be

378
00:23:44,929 --> 00:23:49,260
and I think that's different I mean to
me like a perfect marriage in

379
00:23:49,260 --> 00:23:53,550
a collaboration it is really about the
chemistry between individuals

380
00:23:53,550 --> 00:23:58,190
and I what you share for ideals in the
message that you're gonna carry

381
00:23:58,190 --> 00:24:02,330
and that's not married to a practice
that's not married to a language that

382
00:24:02,330 --> 00:24:04,809
that's married to something higher and
and that's

383
00:24:04,809 --> 00:24:08,110
that's the message of love what you're
trying to sue

384
00:24:08,110 --> 00:24:12,280
relate to an audience in what you're
trying to achieve its not a product

385
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:16,840
love the medium and I think one every
year you're married to a particular I'm

386
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:21,889
medium you're limited to some sense I
mean that's why and some

387
00:24:21,889 --> 00:24:25,760
you know some schools have programming
in there agnostic and

388
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:30,190
and I think that's a good way to be so I
think once you find people that share

389
00:24:30,190 --> 00:24:33,100
your higher ideals it it's easy to
format like a

390
00:24:33,100 --> 00:24:36,309
o'clock creation especially if you have
similar work

391
00:24:36,309 --> 00:24:39,730
chemistry sir chemistry is a that can
balance you out in

392
00:24:39,730 --> 00:24:43,760
and I'll be honest you know I'm still
looking for that but one thing that

393
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:44,600
excites me

394
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:48,500
Clive rationing especially as being an
artist and being someone that

395
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:52,790
you know works in technology there's so
much happening within it and so much

396
00:24:52,790 --> 00:24:54,408
that happens so quickly

397
00:24:54,409 --> 00:24:59,450
like I don't know about you fellows bit
it's impossible for me to stay on top of

398
00:24:59,450 --> 00:25:00,409
it and so

399
00:25:00,409 --> 00:25:04,059
bean in a part of the group you know
antena para

400
00:25:04,059 --> 00:25:07,440
like a hackerspace that's something that
excites me you notice

401
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:10,639
if I can at least work alongside
somebody else it's

402
00:25:10,639 --> 00:25:14,940
doing some other project I have no idea
what it is if I can just hang out talk

403
00:25:14,940 --> 00:25:16,700
about watercooler talk:

404
00:25:16,700 --> 00:25:19,980
you know if I can be online doing what
they're doing in their practice

405
00:25:19,980 --> 00:25:23,950
you know that's food for thought for me
to like my on in the background

406
00:25:23,950 --> 00:25:27,280
it's Mia I find that productive and and
maybe that's the

407
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:30,280
the seeds to cooperation in the future

408
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:34,340
but I mean technology is so dense it's
evolving so quickly

409
00:25:34,340 --> 00:25:37,839
that its its impossible to be

410
00:25:37,839 --> 00:25:42,010
singular and not in that sense so I me I
think that's when the real powers in

411
00:25:42,010 --> 00:25:44,109
like the hackerspace like hive

412
00:25:44,109 --> 00:25:50,570
and hatchery and in philadelphia which
is where I teach

413
00:25:50,570 --> 00:25:53,740
sorry I remembered I think can interrupt

414
00:25:53,740 --> 00:25:57,030
i'd the last clever project I did I do
with my girlfriend

415
00:25:57,030 --> 00:26:00,990
I want to learn book design and so I did
the book designed for

416
00:26:00,990 --> 00:26:05,369
harm Edgar Allan Poe book that the
narrator Arthur Gordon Pym

417
00:26:05,369 --> 00:26:08,940
and she did she's a book artist so she
did like the

418
00:26:08,940 --> 00:26:12,990
om the construction in the cover and it
never got finished

419
00:26:12,990 --> 00:26:18,310
and we fought about it and and a row I
do anything like that anymore

420
00:26:18,310 --> 00:26:21,639
but there's another bro project I want
to make

421
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:24,930
an exploding Book of Secrets so you can
take

422
00:26:24,930 --> 00:26:28,160
cotton and soak it in some acid ever get

423
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:31,420
and it turns into gun cotton which is
explosive

424
00:26:31,420 --> 00:26:34,690
so wanna make a book at like nice con
paper

425
00:26:34,690 --> 00:26:38,480
and Evans gonna write their secret in
pencil and they're gonna turn into an

426
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:39,220
explosive

427
00:26:39,220 --> 00:26:42,770
and set of a book Secrets yeah

428
00:26:42,770 --> 00:26:46,889
so I need I need a performance I need
any the chemists

429
00:26:46,890 --> 00:26:51,070
Anita about an app that acid if anyone
wants to collaborate on exploding Book

430
00:26:51,070 --> 00:26:51,889
of Secrets

431
00:26:51,890 --> 00:26:55,140
how I moving on

432
00:26:55,140 --> 00:26:59,850
I'll go there with its arm well I'm here
representing

433
00:26:59,850 --> 00:27:03,190
tangent our collaborative so arm

434
00:27:03,190 --> 00:27:08,440
a lot love what I do I'd say probably
the sixty percent of what I do now is an

435
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:09,110
artist

436
00:27:09,110 --> 00:27:13,880
this collaboration the last thing I
thought I'd ever do is an artist but

437
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:19,430
here's the weird part arm we have three
people who were primarily part is that

438
00:27:19,430 --> 00:27:21,260
and we bring a lot of other people in

439
00:27:21,260 --> 00:27:26,690
performance people musicians whatever we
happen to kind of need to there's kind

440
00:27:26,690 --> 00:27:27,840
of a core group

441
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:31,830
a kind of non hierarchic group arm

442
00:27:31,830 --> 00:27:34,850
that that composes tangent

443
00:27:34,850 --> 00:27:39,050
here's the stairs the strange part about
engine is that we're all visual artist

444
00:27:39,050 --> 00:27:40,889
but we've all been in a band before

445
00:27:40,890 --> 00:27:45,160
so we can have jokingly say will
tangents like you know tangents the band

446
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:48,780
what we call it the band sometimes and
it seems to me like

447
00:27:48,780 --> 00:27:53,780
musicians and and people anybody's been
in a band kinda knows what I'm talking

448
00:27:53,780 --> 00:27:54,649
about

449
00:27:54,650 --> 00:27:59,560
really kind of intuitively get a grasp
of what you do when you collaborate one

450
00:27:59,560 --> 00:28:00,690
thing you do is you don't

451
00:28:00,690 --> 00:28:04,990
you know what the drummer doesn't tell
the Qatar player how to play the guitar

452
00:28:04,990 --> 00:28:08,320
you know you just have an affinity for
had your sound and how it how it

453
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:09,200
conceals

454
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:13,880
and I think that's something that makes
for good collaboration is kinda

455
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:14,840
understanding

456
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:17,930
where people's skill sets are sort

457
00:28:17,930 --> 00:28:21,090
everybody's a sculpture that's probably
a bad recipe

458
00:28:21,090 --> 00:28:24,750
but if everybody's got a little skill
set that they can contribute to a whole

459
00:28:24,750 --> 00:28:28,840
that's probably a better it's probably
better mix I could keep going but I'm

460
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:29,310
gonna

461
00:28:29,310 --> 00:28:35,600
I'm gonna stop there okay thank you arm

462
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:38,680
biggest see what you yuan

463
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:45,330
taken says Chris Thompson again from 576
in philadelphia

464
00:28:45,330 --> 00:28:48,949
wages for I was gonna say now I
remembered

465
00:28:48,950 --> 00:28:52,280
the last successful clever project I did

466
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:56,440
was in college and it was a sessile cuz
I found

467
00:28:56,440 --> 00:29:01,040
we like came out this guy om his name
for God of course

468
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:04,409
um we had this Giro love my lawyer

469
00:29:04,410 --> 00:29:08,640
and we're all that down the main I'll
walkway outside school wanted to dance

470
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:10,270
really walking on a

471
00:29:10,270 --> 00:29:14,350
a flexible mir and then later we made a
giant maze at it

472
00:29:14,350 --> 00:29:17,540
and that just work because I guess I was
like a

473
00:29:17,540 --> 00:29:21,370
the perfect you know duo we like %ah
let's do the sparse

474
00:29:21,370 --> 00:29:25,270
stock carrier get some polls from the
scrap yard make a maze

475
00:29:25,270 --> 00:29:29,460
arm and nap that was really fun I

476
00:29:29,460 --> 00:29:32,460
I should probably replicate something
awesome like that Danny

477
00:29:32,460 --> 00:29:35,640
Danny went like that's a guy

478
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:40,910
I done okay thank you Chris

479
00:29:40,910 --> 00:29:46,750
so one last question before we open up
to

480
00:29:46,750 --> 00:29:50,220
audience questions I am so

481
00:29:50,220 --> 00:29:54,780
what is it what does the future look
like for her

482
00:29:54,780 --> 00:29:58,330
packer

483
00:29:58,330 --> 00:30:02,490
artists artis hackers hackers an
artist's I

484
00:30:02,490 --> 00:30:05,950
makers and

485
00:30:05,950 --> 00:30:10,470
not necessarily for self but I mean

486
00:30:10,470 --> 00:30:13,700
you know possibly for herself but here

487
00:30:13,700 --> 00:30:20,700
in gap to make sense

488
00:30:23,450 --> 00:30:27,100
tell you thinking a

489
00:30:27,100 --> 00:30:31,540
a teacher teaching University Arts & one
thing that I really believe is

490
00:30:31,540 --> 00:30:33,020
empowering individuals

491
00:30:33,020 --> 00:30:37,360
when I always tell my students is that
you know I'm not just gonna tell you

492
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:39,300
what it takes to get something going

493
00:30:39,300 --> 00:30:42,660
I wanted you one level at least if not
more

494
00:30:42,660 --> 00:30:47,000
below the user so that when something
mocks offer something goes wrong you can

495
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:47,640
actually

496
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:52,170
going to fix that and one thing that I'd
hope it Inc operations

497
00:30:52,170 --> 00:30:57,010
especially with technology one thing
that I find relatively insulting

498
00:30:57,010 --> 00:31:00,870
so when people hear that I work in
technology and I like hockey fix

499
00:31:00,870 --> 00:31:03,070
laptop yeah

500
00:31:03,070 --> 00:31:07,810
yeah art can I just like don't assign
your you know my wifi isn't working at

501
00:31:07,810 --> 00:31:09,350
Cafe Catherine we eat

502
00:31:09,350 --> 00:31:13,060
you know and it it's really in salty
Nana I would hope to spread that

503
00:31:13,060 --> 00:31:15,960
knowledge in that intelligence broader

504
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:19,850
and that that doesn't necessarily mean
you know you're in our sourcing

505
00:31:19,850 --> 00:31:21,660
technology you're the only one Ac

506
00:31:21,660 --> 00:31:25,080
know about this you know I really
believe that programming

507
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:28,820
is the next frontier and that if you
can't

508
00:31:28,820 --> 00:31:33,689
program you know it it's kind of like
not knowing Spanish nowadays like

509
00:31:33,690 --> 00:31:38,180
you need to know that language in order
to be an able to do something

510
00:31:38,180 --> 00:31:42,400
and programming is so powerful I Thomas
tunes

511
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:45,760
you know if I said you know hey go get
me a latte

512
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:49,710
you know I still don't have a latte if I
did that and a programming language I

513
00:31:49,710 --> 00:31:51,270
have a black teen from me

514
00:31:51,270 --> 00:31:55,600
you know it it's very different your
program is the only language that when

515
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:56,030
you

516
00:31:56,030 --> 00:31:59,310
articulated actually executes and

517
00:31:59,310 --> 00:32:03,820
tax that is so powerful that I don't
think people realize that I think if

518
00:32:03,820 --> 00:32:05,850
more people know how to program

519
00:32:05,850 --> 00:32:09,910
that is the next frontier especially of
things are going whether you

520
00:32:09,910 --> 00:32:13,870
work with things physically reaction
work with language is where the U-two

521
00:32:13,870 --> 00:32:18,400
website I mean that is the way things
are going with how much we use mobile

522
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:19,200
out of

523
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:23,840
mobile phones mobile devices I mean
everything is being fitted twice that

524
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:25,340
and if Utah

525
00:32:25,340 --> 00:32:29,460
if you don't have that ten-year arson
all its

526
00:32:29,460 --> 00:32:33,760
it's really going to be challenging and
we're gonna just have this defies for

527
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:37,250
are can you fix my phone and I don't
know it so after up here

528
00:32:37,250 --> 00:32:41,000
and that that's faster and I believe in
enabling users

529
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:47,540
he said a really well I feel like I'm

530
00:32:47,540 --> 00:32:50,690
at a loss cuz I don't know how to
program while on

531
00:32:50,690 --> 00:32:53,800
turn on JavaScript musing this program
called

532
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:57,410
open scared which is kinda like
programming objects and I'm starting to

533
00:32:57,410 --> 00:32:58,470
realize the

534
00:32:58,470 --> 00:33:02,440
the power of that and at some point on
me

535
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:06,110
you know grandpa I can you make a script
for me I mean turn

536
00:33:06,110 --> 00:33:09,230
my emails RAM from

537
00:33:09,230 --> 00:33:12,980
and the in the past

538
00:33:12,980 --> 00:33:16,120
you know liked skills were locked up in
academies

539
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:20,950
and you had to go learn something to
learn a skill but

540
00:33:20,950 --> 00:33:24,470
no one really I think anyone teaches
inspiration

541
00:33:24,470 --> 00:33:28,350
now we have everyone is has some sort
inspirational manana pain

542
00:33:28,350 --> 00:33:31,670
arm I can just go learn how to paint or
sculpt

543
00:33:31,670 --> 00:33:37,300
or do lost wax casting with some printed
plastic and and make some awesome bronze

544
00:33:37,300 --> 00:33:37,990
sculpture

545
00:33:37,990 --> 00:33:41,560
or on so the skill the skill part is
becoming

546
00:33:41,560 --> 00:33:44,710
om like very open

547
00:33:44,710 --> 00:33:47,900
and there's gonna be a lot more art

548
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:52,340
for everyone to critique in and you know
divvy up and a good in bed and personal

549
00:33:52,340 --> 00:33:52,780
into

550
00:33:52,780 --> 00:33:56,430
by Tom there's gonna be more bit which
is good so there's going to be

551
00:33:56,430 --> 00:34:00,330
lot so those must have cool stuff to
look at

552
00:34:00,330 --> 00:34:06,080
for when every do with our I don't know
if I can answer the question but I can't

553
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:07,970
give you a couple of anecdotes

554
00:34:07,970 --> 00:34:11,010
sorry yeah okay

555
00:34:11,010 --> 00:34:14,100
is yet not give it up arm

556
00:34:14,100 --> 00:34:18,509
one is arm at the school where my

557
00:34:18,510 --> 00:34:22,140
little girls Co arm the star

558
00:34:22,139 --> 00:34:25,330
these guys off with scratch- so the kind
of learn

559
00:34:25,330 --> 00:34:29,130
a little code in a kind of visual
metaphor way

560
00:34:29,130 --> 00:34:32,290
i'm talking about kindergarten and
first-grade

561
00:34:32,290 --> 00:34:36,270
so they're hitting it rate of two bad 30
mystifying it

562
00:34:36,270 --> 00:34:40,139
and I think that that's if a lot of
people

563
00:34:40,139 --> 00:34:43,210
are doing that that's a good thing I
don't think a lot of people are doing

564
00:34:43,210 --> 00:34:45,639
that but I commend MIT for making at

565
00:34:45,639 --> 00:34:49,299
fancy thing that I wish I would have had
arm

566
00:34:49,300 --> 00:34:53,420
growing up arm the other thing is

567
00:34:53,420 --> 00:34:56,639
I think in a lot of ways I'll

568
00:34:56,639 --> 00:35:01,950
tho ideas behind 3d printing laser
cutting all of these kinds of

569
00:35:01,950 --> 00:35:07,589
are enabling arm technologies that are
kind of coming out of these

570
00:35:07,590 --> 00:35:11,640
really expensive you know high and
things down to

571
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:15,730
you know maybe they're a little less
higher resolution but they're still

572
00:35:15,730 --> 00:35:18,970
and enabling people to get involved with

573
00:35:18,970 --> 00:35:22,450
making tangible things at it digital
stuff

574
00:35:22,450 --> 00:35:28,480
and I think that's gonna be a real
transformation

575
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:31,660
actually answered your question

576
00:35:31,660 --> 00:35:34,790
I just wanna say one other thing you
know when I was starting out in like

577
00:35:34,790 --> 00:35:35,520
working

578
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:40,390
with microcontrollers and we had to have
these devices in like program on there

579
00:35:40,390 --> 00:35:42,960
like two or three hundred dollars in the
Arduino

580
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:47,390
came out you know that's like 30 bucks
and there's like it have and everybody's

581
00:35:47,390 --> 00:35:49,720
thinking things open source and the
thing that's

582
00:35:49,720 --> 00:35:53,860
that's so inspiring to me at least in
like the past eight years is how

583
00:35:53,860 --> 00:35:57,470
fastest office meeting and accessible to
anyone

584
00:35:57,470 --> 00:36:01,760
like it's not closed off it's not as
closed off as it used to be when I was

585
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:03,070
out there

586
00:36:03,070 --> 00:36:06,870
yeah having to work with engineers and
to me that's the thing that's most

587
00:36:06,870 --> 00:36:08,910
exciting if people can make things more

588
00:36:08,910 --> 00:36:13,430
open-sourced and to actually share
things get things and get home

589
00:36:13,430 --> 00:36:16,690
you know talk to other people have
things out there and just introduce

590
00:36:16,690 --> 00:36:18,320
people to things

591
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:25,320
a lot can happen

592
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:32,690
thank you all com thing really open up
to some audience questions

593
00:36:32,690 --> 00:36:39,690
there is an audience here Shanghai

594
00:36:44,730 --> 00:36:51,730
I will act as a mic stand you all talked
a lot about

595
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:55,759
DM the again

596
00:36:55,760 --> 00:37:00,710
the inspiration CNN the technology great
out and that that gave you fuel

597
00:37:00,710 --> 00:37:04,260
to to to do your art have anything going
the other way

598
00:37:04,260 --> 00:37:08,800
%um you see the technology the art
inspiring technology may be for

599
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:12,080
at you know project you're working on
you have to figure out

600
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:16,210
a certain process how to how to make
that happen but once the technology is

601
00:37:16,210 --> 00:37:17,090
there you can

602
00:37:17,090 --> 00:37:24,090
find other applications for

603
00:37:29,790 --> 00:37:32,640
when you mention technology inspiring
your art

604
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:35,960
but nine SA the other way around I was
wondering if if you

605
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:42,960
she the art inspiring technology I guess
for me personally no way

606
00:37:47,900 --> 00:37:53,050
the way that our work and like I may see
like a lot of things happen but that

607
00:37:53,050 --> 00:37:53,560
doesn't

608
00:37:53,560 --> 00:37:56,980
necessarily inspire me it it's actually
really frustrating

609
00:37:56,980 --> 00:38:00,870
in Eq some people I really feel like
they can sit there and they can

610
00:38:00,870 --> 00:38:05,200
make something and then conspired to
like take something for their in

611
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:09,350
I don't I don't know what you fellows
but I I really don't work that way I get

612
00:38:09,350 --> 00:38:13,069
an idea in my mind and then I have to go
about finding the means to like

613
00:38:13,070 --> 00:38:13,990
gratified that

614
00:38:13,990 --> 00:38:18,030
and I one project on I'm working on
right now

615
00:38:18,030 --> 00:38:21,490
you know its claim between like working
with Astrix actually working with Inc

616
00:38:21,490 --> 00:38:24,700
radios and link you know transmitters
something

617
00:38:24,700 --> 00:38:29,970
quite different means that could stall
achieve like relatively the same purpose

618
00:38:29,970 --> 00:38:34,140
so at certain points you know I look for
what's going to make a

619
00:38:34,140 --> 00:38:37,560
what technology is going to make it
easier but then won some

620
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:40,930
in there with the technology for me that
inspires

621
00:38:40,930 --> 00:38:45,419
other ideas because I see the
possibilities within that I don't think

622
00:38:45,420 --> 00:38:46,180
that quite

623
00:38:46,180 --> 00:38:50,319
answers your idea could it seems to be
like what ideas actually gonna push the

624
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:51,080
technology

625
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:58,080
and hacking

626
00:38:59,030 --> 00:38:59,980
a vision have

627
00:38:59,980 --> 00:39:03,460
a certain project and how it suppose to
look and you have to figure out

628
00:39:03,460 --> 00:39:07,340
the process to make that a reality
winter to ratified as you said

629
00:39:07,340 --> 00:39:12,150
and once you solve that problem then
you've got this leftover technology

630
00:39:12,150 --> 00:39:19,150
you can use for for other means I keep
finding myself

631
00:39:20,530 --> 00:39:23,850
arm on to has like are think ok cool

632
00:39:23,850 --> 00:39:27,120
inspirational ideas like the the clock
thing

633
00:39:27,120 --> 00:39:30,609
and then on the other hand I keep
collecting tools

634
00:39:30,610 --> 00:39:35,500
arm like I have an MSP 4:30 and I know
how to program it now what

635
00:39:35,500 --> 00:39:39,950
but it's like I have these piles up
towards a car keys Sugrue

636
00:39:39,950 --> 00:39:43,660
and shape block and then I can mold some
moving like to do is a thing one among

637
00:39:43,660 --> 00:39:44,020
and

638
00:39:44,020 --> 00:39:47,020
on a woman do so I keep II keep

639
00:39:47,020 --> 00:39:50,030
generating a giant tool chest in my head

640
00:39:50,030 --> 00:39:53,500
arm so hopefully when I do come up with
a great idea

641
00:39:53,500 --> 00:39:56,700
ecologists on his bank couple things
together in

642
00:39:56,700 --> 00:40:00,200
and I have a call thanks arm so

643
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:04,380
working on it a.m.

644
00:40:04,380 --> 00:40:07,650
I'm thinking the answer is

645
00:40:07,650 --> 00:40:12,230
a kind of historical answer and I think
are the history of art is

646
00:40:12,230 --> 00:40:16,030
replete with examples love technologies
that

647
00:40:16,030 --> 00:40:19,720
been kinda repurposed you know like
anything from clay

648
00:40:19,720 --> 00:40:23,200
for pottery to clay for figure modeling

649
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:28,350
up printmaking which was just the way it
kinda getting information out there

650
00:40:28,350 --> 00:40:29,390
maybe that was like

651
00:40:29,390 --> 00:40:33,299
you know the first to the first
iteration of information

652
00:40:33,300 --> 00:40:37,810
technology rate suddenly becomes away a
generating images so

653
00:40:37,810 --> 00:40:41,970
are welding really kind of an industrial
construction process that suddenly

654
00:40:41,970 --> 00:40:44,210
become so it's copters work with metal

655
00:40:44,210 --> 00:40:47,980
arm so I think are you know artist just
kind of

656
00:40:47,980 --> 00:40:54,650
are for hard-wired to repurposed
technologies that exist for other things

657
00:40:54,650 --> 00:40:56,280
and make their images that way

658
00:40:56,280 --> 00:41:00,010
so I'm not saying that what you're
suggesting

659
00:41:00,010 --> 00:41:04,710
isn't impossible our scenario

660
00:41:04,710 --> 00:41:08,210
but it does seem like the equation is
not symmetrical

661
00:41:08,210 --> 00:41:11,620
no yeah is it well

662
00:41:11,620 --> 00:41:18,620
so I don't know I'm an idiot fact me to
talk

663
00:41:19,810 --> 00:41:24,500
me well I'm not I guess what it would be
kinda means is that maybe

664
00:41:24,500 --> 00:41:28,600
maybe hackers and artists are beginning
to converge

665
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:32,130
right so at some point we won't have
those

666
00:41:32,130 --> 00:41:38,930
we won't have those terms what are some
of your

667
00:41:38,930 --> 00:41:42,740
early inspirations that guy you into
hacking and being an artist

668
00:41:42,740 --> 00:41:49,740
very early on rain

669
00:41:50,250 --> 00:41:53,440
um why got into art

670
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:56,590
very slow where start of the engineering
and

671
00:41:56,590 --> 00:42:00,670
won my first project was designing a
chair and I think air any engineering

672
00:42:00,670 --> 00:42:02,330
firm what are called like this

673
00:42:02,330 --> 00:42:06,009
and it's going to be newspaper in a pox
the awesome arm

674
00:42:06,010 --> 00:42:10,600
and so then I started designing stuff
and then I skipped into

675
00:42:10,600 --> 00:42:14,590
the design our school and then I had to
takes to your classes in its target in

676
00:42:14,590 --> 00:42:15,100
art

677
00:42:15,100 --> 00:42:22,100
arm and assortment retard all the other
half the question out

678
00:42:25,470 --> 00:42:28,830
um now

679
00:42:28,830 --> 00:42:33,430
and on the question carry-on
inspirations

680
00:42:33,430 --> 00:42:38,620
are artists early inspiration

681
00:42:38,620 --> 00:42:43,390
Lego Lego am just putting stuff together

682
00:42:43,390 --> 00:42:47,009
I mean I wasn't really a and I'm not
very good drawer

683
00:42:47,010 --> 00:42:51,340
to it was amazing

684
00:42:51,340 --> 00:42:56,730
and for me I'm bridge

685
00:42:56,730 --> 00:43:01,150
and Penry Island Bridge the apology line
like a few years

686
00:43:01,150 --> 00:43:04,760
like back in the eighties something that
like really influences me now

687
00:43:04,760 --> 00:43:08,870
and Ben Rubin

688
00:43:08,870 --> 00:43:12,230
and another fellow who's name is
completely

689
00:43:12,230 --> 00:43:16,970
meeting me on did a listening post I
don't know if anybody got to see that

690
00:43:16,970 --> 00:43:20,380
on it was and mesmerizing

691
00:43:20,380 --> 00:43:24,150
is as anybody from Iran to listening
post

692
00:43:24,150 --> 00:43:27,970
oh my god you guys on need to YouTube
this okay

693
00:43:27,970 --> 00:43:31,600
The Listening Post okay I am

694
00:43:31,600 --> 00:43:36,550
it's a really amazing thing they have
all these little screens and

695
00:43:36,550 --> 00:43:39,670
I am scans you know

696
00:43:39,670 --> 00:43:44,520
like blogs and 19 holes in like the
first couple lines

697
00:43:44,520 --> 00:43:48,190
you know here he did I feel

698
00:43:48,190 --> 00:43:52,690
can see is face in my hand I have a
visual memory been on train names

699
00:43:52,690 --> 00:43:56,500
I feel fine

700
00:43:56,500 --> 00:44:01,760
we feel it who is his name

701
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:04,880
I could totally see my head this is such
a crime

702
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:08,160
anyway I'm fascinated by social
relationships and how social

703
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:10,670
relationships are brokered by technology

704
00:44:10,670 --> 00:44:15,720
if we look at how all blogs facilitate
communication and how that gets out you

705
00:44:15,720 --> 00:44:17,260
know how Twitter

706
00:44:17,260 --> 00:44:20,350
uses communication you know that the
fella

707
00:44:20,350 --> 00:44:23,790
that to the talk earlier today about
life social bonds that's what really

708
00:44:23,790 --> 00:44:24,160
like

709
00:44:24,160 --> 00:44:27,640
influences me how technology brokers
this

710
00:44:27,640 --> 00:44:31,910
and then I i look at that and i like it
that is information that I can then

711
00:44:31,910 --> 00:44:35,440
take to make meaning and and other
relationships

712
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:38,510
so I don't necessarily technology kinda

713
00:44:38,510 --> 00:44:42,120
works two ways its it's a medium to work
with then

714
00:44:42,120 --> 00:44:45,839
and that it's another research practice
but they don't necessarily have to be

715
00:44:45,840 --> 00:44:46,840
the same thing

716
00:44:46,840 --> 00:44:49,910
like that when I'm working on it doesn't
have to be

717
00:44:49,910 --> 00:44:54,029
that in itself I'm always trying to
attach like a higher mean

718
00:44:54,030 --> 00:44:57,640
hypothesis a theology so it's not just
like

719
00:44:57,640 --> 00:45:03,069
it works now whose I think as an artist
it has to be something else because

720
00:45:03,070 --> 00:45:06,380
technology is is happening so quickly
around us

721
00:45:06,380 --> 00:45:09,950
and there's so many more brilliant
engineers

722
00:45:09,950 --> 00:45:14,500
then I am you know I classify myself
more as an artist and engineering in

723
00:45:14,500 --> 00:45:18,120
they can make it work probably a lot
quicker and a lot better than I can

724
00:45:18,120 --> 00:45:21,470
but can they attach that that meaning
command cash that

725
00:45:21,470 --> 00:45:25,220
idea outside au white is

726
00:45:25,220 --> 00:45:32,220
to make something else that that to me
is time like getting going

727
00:45:32,520 --> 00:45:35,980
alright um I think for me

728
00:45:35,980 --> 00:45:39,670
an early influence might have been
Laurie Anderson right you know she

729
00:45:39,670 --> 00:45:43,330
what's this person who is able to tell
really

730
00:45:43,330 --> 00:45:46,500
interesting story arm

731
00:45:46,500 --> 00:45:51,370
not only with her party but also with
these disarming Lee low-tech high-tech

732
00:45:51,370 --> 00:45:53,609
hybrids like taking something like it

733
00:45:53,610 --> 00:45:58,240
a piece of tape are with her voice and
sticking in on a file in

734
00:45:58,240 --> 00:46:02,790
arm and having that mean something arm

735
00:46:02,790 --> 00:46:07,190
II I can think about others but I'll
just stop to leave it there

736
00:46:07,190 --> 00:46:14,190
Laurie Anderson yeah

737
00:46:20,829 --> 00:46:23,990
II whether respond to your question um

738
00:46:23,990 --> 00:46:29,859
at I did the MD project there are by the
project the last two conferences

739
00:46:29,859 --> 00:46:33,460
on and I'm an artist and

740
00:46:33,460 --> 00:46:37,869
it came from a problem that I want us
all and the problem was

741
00:46:37,869 --> 00:46:42,339
that when you come to ho it's hard to
find people

742
00:46:42,339 --> 00:46:45,619
who have similar interests that you can
discuss those interest with

743
00:46:45,619 --> 00:46:49,990
you can come and listen to one person
talk but then there's no follow-up

744
00:46:49,990 --> 00:46:53,759
so the problem that existed was how you
connect those people

745
00:46:53,759 --> 00:46:57,569
and we start brainstorming with things
like well what if we did

746
00:46:57,569 --> 00:47:01,160
a session and there were different
colors of yarn on different tables and

747
00:47:01,160 --> 00:47:04,930
now and Dom then somebody mentioned RFID

748
00:47:04,930 --> 00:47:09,299
and we're talking about doing RFID
gateways because we

749
00:47:09,299 --> 00:47:12,349
we couldn't find anything that was
actually an active RFID in

750
00:47:12,349 --> 00:47:16,589
and so the whole thing came up creating
this

751
00:47:16,589 --> 00:47:19,859
technology that expanded on what the CCC
and on

752
00:47:19,859 --> 00:47:23,788
from just needing to solve a problem

753
00:47:23,789 --> 00:47:27,380
and the problem was how do you help
people find each other I hope

754
00:47:27,380 --> 00:47:31,700
who don't know each other and don't know
that they should and Dom

755
00:47:31,700 --> 00:47:36,539
so it came from that and the CCC it
created something

756
00:47:36,539 --> 00:47:40,670
that was an RFID tag where you could
follow people around on a map

757
00:47:40,670 --> 00:47:43,869
and we create something that was a
social

758
00:47:43,869 --> 00:47:47,489
platformer you log into the website and
in turn your interests and make

759
00:47:47,489 --> 00:47:50,960
we connected those two things and to me
as an artist

760
00:47:50,960 --> 00:47:55,200
anything that's interesting anything
that you could actually call

761
00:47:55,200 --> 00:47:58,349
a relevant piece of art is something
that

762
00:47:58,349 --> 00:48:02,339
makes a turn that and it's the same
thing in

763
00:48:02,339 --> 00:48:05,359
engineering its anything

764
00:48:05,359 --> 00:48:08,759
that is a hack is %uh it's a right turn

765
00:48:08,759 --> 00:48:12,509
its it goes back to mom the first
Thacker

766
00:48:12,509 --> 00:48:15,980
if you want to think about mythology is
permitted yes because you get fired the

767
00:48:15,980 --> 00:48:18,759
humans and suddenly there's a right turn
in the universe

768
00:48:18,759 --> 00:48:23,269
and if you wanna go to 2001 a Space
Odyssey

769
00:48:23,269 --> 00:48:27,089
the first wall is the monkey that says

770
00:48:27,089 --> 00:48:30,160
I with a bone

771
00:48:30,160 --> 00:48:34,578
and figures out know I can hit something
with something else and it's a tool

772
00:48:34,579 --> 00:48:37,730
and that's a right turn and or left
Turner

773
00:48:37,730 --> 00:48:41,130
whatever hard turn you wanna make thats

774
00:48:41,130 --> 00:48:44,150
when you're creating to work and

775
00:48:44,150 --> 00:48:47,539
and that's where something becomes
interesting to me is art and

776
00:48:47,539 --> 00:48:51,359
and as hack so I think I've

777
00:48:51,359 --> 00:48:54,690
art relevant art and hacks as being

778
00:48:54,690 --> 00:48:57,940
interchangeable things thank you

779
00:48:57,940 --> 00:49:03,349
thank you now

780
00:49:03,349 --> 00:49:08,119
I think they're actually any hazardous
are now because night even the of buffer

781
00:49:08,119 --> 00:49:09,210
overflow is ahead

782
00:49:09,210 --> 00:49:14,039
me this is really beautiful emmys letter
new exploration something that was never

783
00:49:14,039 --> 00:49:14,640
done

784
00:49:14,640 --> 00:49:18,359
even social engineering I mean I have a
friend who is making

785
00:49:18,359 --> 00:49:21,509
prank call him and he's actually doing
anything illegal but

786
00:49:21,509 --> 00:49:24,910
what he called a a lady he pretend to be
a

787
00:49:24,910 --> 00:49:28,519
telecom you know an hour technician

788
00:49:28,519 --> 00:49:33,799
she said to this lady to raise her hand
because she should take pictures she had

789
00:49:33,799 --> 00:49:35,390
like a bad recession her phone

790
00:49:35,390 --> 00:49:39,180
is your victory following the orders I
mean I think the are two areas like

791
00:49:39,180 --> 00:49:39,839
crazy

792
00:49:39,839 --> 00:49:43,690
have is better for us re:

793
00:49:43,690 --> 00:49:49,359
and then you know he is she/he order her
to flush the toilet and Osun they'll say

794
00:49:49,359 --> 00:49:52,430
or house to relate to the pharmacy lost
actually doing it

795
00:49:52,430 --> 00:49:59,430
I and

796
00:50:08,490 --> 00:50:12,119
right

797
00:50:12,119 --> 00:50:14,540
but I have a question now on

798
00:50:14,540 --> 00:50:17,960
actually on your problem with exploding

799
00:50:17,960 --> 00:50:21,599
known book actually that are reminding
me

800
00:50:21,599 --> 00:50:25,240
I'll an idea that I had a I love art

801
00:50:25,240 --> 00:50:28,490
going beyond the medium for example

802
00:50:28,490 --> 00:50:33,000
are my idea was to write a book called
David memoirs memoirs

803
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:36,680
of them easier and was a a text book

804
00:50:36,680 --> 00:50:40,259
I mean a book %uh novel there was
written with it

805
00:50:40,260 --> 00:50:43,750
invisible Inc so basically like

806
00:50:43,750 --> 00:50:48,640
was he was exposed daughter have on the
oxide you start to fade out

807
00:50:48,640 --> 00:50:52,140
all all the texts so it will be without
mixing

808
00:50:52,140 --> 00:50:57,009
that metaphor night in the book but the
frustrating thing was that

809
00:50:57,010 --> 00:51:00,640
after a week of having the datya I
realized at

810
00:51:00,640 --> 00:51:03,710
someone Argentina was polishing books

811
00:51:03,710 --> 00:51:07,770
woulda no disappearing Inc a slight

812
00:51:07,770 --> 00:51:14,770
man I I had the idea first for you know
the thing is that

813
00:51:17,770 --> 00:51:22,130
is being happening a lot you know it I
had earlier the year then I really

814
00:51:22,130 --> 00:51:23,270
someone else did it

815
00:51:23,270 --> 00:51:27,890
only if you guys also well I having that
kind of experiences I like

816
00:51:27,890 --> 00:51:31,879
the ground Bell who did minute if on
someone else who comes in

817
00:51:31,880 --> 00:51:38,080
yeah I would just say who cares

818
00:51:38,080 --> 00:51:41,509
like who cares if they had that idea

819
00:51:41,510 --> 00:51:44,310
you know I like you know what you're
trying to say maybe they try to say

820
00:51:44,310 --> 00:51:45,560
something different but the

821
00:51:45,560 --> 00:51:50,480
the process if up trying to have that
idea actually kinda evolution

822
00:51:50,480 --> 00:51:54,070
with how you see in your mind i mean
sometimes it can be me. for me

823
00:51:54,070 --> 00:51:56,460
personally sort of like foggy it's like

824
00:51:56,460 --> 00:52:01,269
in an hour from lansing this and and
then I started doing it and then it

825
00:52:01,269 --> 00:52:05,250
it starts to become real you know when
you actually start to

826
00:52:05,250 --> 00:52:08,589
speak an idea that sort of foggy in your
mind

827
00:52:08,589 --> 00:52:13,019
how that language starts to chisel out
your ID anything now I didn't mean now

828
00:52:13,019 --> 00:52:13,609
where to

829
00:52:13,609 --> 00:52:17,640
actually in on this one sounds more
right and that

830
00:52:17,640 --> 00:52:20,900
got not only that that process so

831
00:52:20,900 --> 00:52:25,720
your own idea to take shape and even if
your modeling

832
00:52:25,720 --> 00:52:29,960
your process ups of love somebody also
it's done something quite similar

833
00:52:29,960 --> 00:52:33,019
inevitably you're going to a quite
different and

834
00:52:33,019 --> 00:52:36,200
that's part of what evolution is all
about

835
00:52:36,200 --> 00:52:39,230
you know we all do something that
everybody else is done

836
00:52:39,230 --> 00:52:43,099
but as a product to have love doing it
as well

837
00:52:43,099 --> 00:52:46,430
it in Everett comes out slightly
different and

838
00:52:46,430 --> 00:52:49,430
through the iteration up trying to own
it

839
00:52:49,430 --> 00:52:53,299
to closer to what you feel in your heart
and your soul is right

840
00:52:53,299 --> 00:52:58,220
inevitably it a maybe something quick
wildly different than what you initially

841
00:52:58,220 --> 00:52:58,769
vision

842
00:52:58,769 --> 00:53:02,980
and what what process it you hide it

843
00:53:02,980 --> 00:53:07,200
neared as well so I think it's a it's a
beautiful thing

844
00:53:07,200 --> 00:53:11,059
in addition to developing your own your
own skill set

845
00:53:11,059 --> 00:53:14,700
with and so I I never think an idea is

846
00:53:14,700 --> 00:53:18,470
you know it's it's something you should
you should do you should just throw it

847
00:53:18,470 --> 00:53:19,940
away just because somebody else's day

848
00:53:19,940 --> 00:53:24,980
you need to think about excuse where you
at something

849
00:53:24,980 --> 00:53:29,650
so um I I think that ideas are

850
00:53:29,650 --> 00:53:33,589
worthless compared to execution so I saw
that thing with the

851
00:53:33,589 --> 00:53:36,970
om disappearing books and I'm sure if
you do it wouldn't be

852
00:53:36,970 --> 00:53:40,500
exactly the same so said you have to I'm

853
00:53:40,500 --> 00:53:43,789
your own thing on it I'm that's why I'm
not worried about

854
00:53:43,789 --> 00:53:47,869
you know giving guys the idea the
exploding book because if you do it

855
00:53:47,869 --> 00:53:51,059
be awesome I may not have to cuz I be so
awesome

856
00:53:51,059 --> 00:53:55,069
arm I have a have another a I can I can

857
00:53:55,069 --> 00:53:58,470
open source for this this onto arm I
wanna make

858
00:53:58,470 --> 00:54:02,910
a a giant cool covered in floating

859
00:54:02,910 --> 00:54:06,690
money play Scrooge McDuck so mold that
these

860
00:54:06,690 --> 00:54:10,740
thousands of um hollow metallic gold
coins

861
00:54:10,740 --> 00:54:13,950
and the can down pour money so if you
beat me to it

862
00:54:13,950 --> 00:54:18,009
you got invited to the party so did go
do stuff

863
00:54:18,009 --> 00:54:22,140
and and then mean someone to the
painting and then the next first car was

864
00:54:22,140 --> 00:54:24,960
a call somebody already put some oil on
some boorda can

865
00:54:24,960 --> 00:54:29,569
you know you have to at some point la
this new media stuff it's like well

866
00:54:29,569 --> 00:54:32,808
I was the first one to put a spray can
on a robot

867
00:54:32,809 --> 00:54:36,190
to get what they need in town on how you
did now I can put a spring had to figure

868
00:54:36,190 --> 00:54:37,279
it out from scratch

869
00:54:37,279 --> 00:54:41,279
to you you do the project and then you
open source and then next person does

870
00:54:41,279 --> 00:54:42,559
the project even better in

871
00:54:42,559 --> 00:54:46,990
some competition yet been at that

872
00:54:46,990 --> 00:54:50,920
that that kinda makes me think about our
home

873
00:54:50,920 --> 00:54:54,319
serve originality you know you're
talking about

874
00:54:54,319 --> 00:54:59,009
to the Shibboleth originality right can
happen anymore that was

875
00:54:59,009 --> 00:55:02,089
I think that's like an echo that comes
out of modernism

876
00:55:02,089 --> 00:55:06,328
you know if you know anything about art
history those guys

877
00:55:06,329 --> 00:55:11,029
were really kind of obsessed with
getting to an idea first

878
00:55:11,029 --> 00:55:15,140
even if it meant that the product wasn't
necessarily so beautiful

879
00:55:15,140 --> 00:55:18,589
right %uh not to say there's not
beautiful modern art but I think you

880
00:55:18,589 --> 00:55:19,750
know what I'm talking about

881
00:55:19,750 --> 00:55:22,819
arm

882
00:55:22,819 --> 00:55:26,730
you know these days I think we're free
apps that I think that's maybe the gift

883
00:55:26,730 --> 00:55:28,420
to postmodernism gave us is that

884
00:55:28,420 --> 00:55:31,690
in a really in a beautiful things can
come out love

885
00:55:31,690 --> 00:55:35,700
putting two things that already exist
together in a way that

886
00:55:35,700 --> 00:55:39,069
you know changes the way that they exist

887
00:55:39,069 --> 00:55:46,069
so thank heavens we one more question

888
00:55:51,640 --> 00:55:54,870
so um I think we happen I mean

889
00:55:54,870 --> 00:55:58,080
may question has a the with your process

890
00:55:58,080 --> 00:56:01,130
and you have been really spoken much

891
00:56:01,130 --> 00:56:04,210
about your specific big specific

892
00:56:04,210 --> 00:56:07,890
works that you've done and also because

893
00:56:07,890 --> 00:56:11,960
I think I mean over over this conference
having curing

894
00:56:11,960 --> 00:56:15,740
again again this very specific
definition of what a hack

895
00:56:15,740 --> 00:56:18,760
is somewhat how Greece which is
something to think using technology you

896
00:56:18,760 --> 00:56:19,710
know where wesson

897
00:56:19,710 --> 00:56:23,260
originally intended to and I think to

898
00:56:23,260 --> 00:56:27,110
at em a simple definition of art is very
ambitious

899
00:56:27,110 --> 00:56:31,320
I said it go leg with my god like I
think the are fit project that was just

900
00:56:31,320 --> 00:56:32,690
mention having is awesome

901
00:56:32,690 --> 00:56:37,030
absolutely but i i wouldn't comment art
just because and i think is like a

902
00:56:37,030 --> 00:56:38,480
community in the same president

903
00:56:38,480 --> 00:56:43,730
and the the way you're talkin oo what
you do it sort of makes me question if

904
00:56:43,730 --> 00:56:44,170
it's

905
00:56:44,170 --> 00:56:47,320
are hiking as art

906
00:56:47,320 --> 00:56:50,460
in the sense that Princess Catherine
describes process is an hour

907
00:56:50,460 --> 00:56:54,520
they you really have and pension
appointee wanna do and then you make the

908
00:56:54,520 --> 00:56:56,380
technology is serving nine thanks for
your

909
00:56:56,380 --> 00:57:00,520
you're not like starting anything with
your use of technology or maybe you're

910
00:57:00,520 --> 00:57:01,900
an eye with I would like to

911
00:57:01,900 --> 00:57:05,510
that's where something with a specific
or let you describe it

912
00:57:05,510 --> 00:57:10,830
use you go after the glitch humint neck
latest editing images but you're not

913
00:57:10,830 --> 00:57:11,840
using glitches

914
00:57:11,840 --> 00:57:15,810
like your yourself a king so to speak
which is in Photoshop

915
00:57:15,810 --> 00:57:19,880
so I would like you to describe to have
maybe if you could describe

916
00:57:19,880 --> 00:57:23,090
in is specific to pray you have you done

917
00:57:23,090 --> 00:57:27,360
and if you could come up with light
what's your own take

918
00:57:27,360 --> 00:57:31,330
I like what the definition of art of
what art piece for you and then sort of

919
00:57:31,330 --> 00:57:32,450
like to clarify

920
00:57:32,450 --> 00:57:36,430
if you are a hiker our dues are in our
dues for users like

921
00:57:36,430 --> 00:57:40,270
tools after hacking community right of
course

922
00:57:40,270 --> 00:57:44,640
I mean everything goes that this is not
out by the judgment just for

923
00:57:44,640 --> 00:57:47,920
current terms thank thank you

924
00:57:47,920 --> 00:57:51,390
I'm I have one piece

925
00:57:51,390 --> 00:57:55,250
%uh that uses mores which are kinda arm

926
00:57:55,250 --> 00:57:58,270
the usually I unintended no

927
00:57:58,270 --> 00:58:01,620
to to screens overlap arm

928
00:58:01,620 --> 00:58:05,100
amusing something that is

929
00:58:05,100 --> 00:58:10,360
as a byproduct something that unintended
arm if you see a more a on TV like on

930
00:58:10,360 --> 00:58:11,450
like that so much

931
00:58:11,450 --> 00:58:15,210
arm and it's it's not this one doesn't
have so many

932
00:58:15,210 --> 00:58:18,670
glitches in it but I took a photo I love

933
00:58:18,670 --> 00:58:23,670
an LCD screen with my camera and the
overlap with the sensor pixels with two

934
00:58:23,670 --> 00:58:27,920
the screen pixels me this really awesome
or a its visually interesting

935
00:58:27,920 --> 00:58:32,000
mess with in Photoshop in and make
something that is

936
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:35,130
that I printed out and hung on a wall
and

937
00:58:35,130 --> 00:58:39,290
for some for most definitions that are
I'm but it in rowing

938
00:58:39,290 --> 00:58:43,570
concern me that I iced wasn't trying to
make art when I was doing ours is trying

939
00:58:43,570 --> 00:58:44,110
to make

940
00:58:44,110 --> 00:58:47,330
something that was visually appealing

941
00:58:47,330 --> 00:58:51,850
that I had fun doing home so

942
00:58:51,850 --> 00:58:55,569
and

943
00:58:55,570 --> 00:58:59,120
more thoughts Africa I am

944
00:58:59,120 --> 00:59:02,660
at I don't remember everything in your
question

945
00:59:02,660 --> 00:59:06,020
yes I'll be honest so I am shimmy it

946
00:59:06,020 --> 00:59:09,630
it revolves around like a lot every
search

947
00:59:09,630 --> 00:59:13,410
like own lot every search because I'm
not

948
00:59:13,410 --> 00:59:17,290
even almonds often technology a lot

949
00:59:17,290 --> 00:59:20,720
it's a lot when I think about it a lot
182 I'd

950
00:59:20,720 --> 00:59:25,420
still don't feel like I know a lot about
technology and constantly learning a lot

951
00:59:25,420 --> 00:59:28,470
about those around me and so when I get
an idea

952
00:59:28,470 --> 00:59:33,830
my my ideas come on over have different
things they don't come out Nov

953
00:59:33,830 --> 00:59:37,299
looking at the materials that I work
with the Ca Mau Nov

954
00:59:37,300 --> 00:59:40,860
how I live my life they come out of how
I interact with my friends

955
00:59:40,860 --> 00:59:44,070
they come out my memory is they they
come out of

956
00:59:44,070 --> 00:59:47,770
things that ur home not things that you
can

957
00:59:47,770 --> 00:59:52,400
necessarily see in the physical world on
I look at technology to ratify them

958
00:59:52,400 --> 00:59:56,510
answer from you into it when I look at
my materials it's all about looking up

959
00:59:56,510 --> 01:00:00,650
out how I can ratify that and I N I
don't strictly look at

960
01:00:00,650 --> 01:00:04,610
you know it's not like I'm a baseball
player I'm just gonna go play baseball

961
01:00:04,610 --> 01:00:08,430
you know it it's this whole arsenal saw
a look at a lot of different

962
01:00:08,430 --> 01:00:13,570
things that made XIV demeans I look at
how they cheat the means a look at

963
01:00:13,570 --> 01:00:17,000
how are they poetically can achieve this
mean to those

964
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:22,130
close to 1 I'm trying to do so for me
it's not a done deal

965
01:00:22,130 --> 01:00:25,360
you know on the Philadelphia Museum of
Art

966
01:00:25,360 --> 01:00:29,300
had this beautiful exhibition a Marcel
Duchamp's

967
01:00:29,300 --> 01:00:34,420
work and they they showed in all the
integrations that he dead and its

968
01:00:34,420 --> 01:00:38,340
took a look at Tech 804 like to finally
get it

969
01:00:38,340 --> 01:00:42,470
this sculpture that he could only a few
through like a slit

970
01:00:42,470 --> 01:00:46,610
heard you know like a peephole and all
the work he did just to

971
01:00:46,610 --> 01:00:51,210
just to get to that point is is really
how I look at my own practice

972
01:00:51,210 --> 01:00:55,430
so it's not just it's it's not just this
cost of my lisette

973
01:00:55,430 --> 01:00:59,870
ideas and I'm still working on its
constant generation its

974
01:00:59,870 --> 01:01:04,170
until I feel satisfied it's very rare

975
01:01:04,170 --> 01:01:07,230
on in it the Niner an exhibition night
that I feel

976
01:01:07,230 --> 01:01:10,240
aren't satisfied went with what's there
it's like

977
01:01:10,240 --> 01:01:13,420
you know that could be tweaked their you
know now I see is here

978
01:01:13,420 --> 01:01:16,970
psych totally rock gotta to campus slick

979
01:01:16,970 --> 01:01:21,310
in a I mean so it's got it its that that
tries mean

980
01:01:21,310 --> 01:01:24,320
as an artist party that like and
satisfaction

981
01:01:24,320 --> 01:01:31,320
and desire to keep learning and trying
to find

982
01:01:31,720 --> 01:01:35,450
see you said some you know like the arm
definition dove

983
01:01:35,450 --> 01:01:38,590
hacking is to conserve repurpose a
technology your

984
01:01:38,590 --> 01:01:43,360
for for re contextualize the technology
right

985
01:01:43,360 --> 01:01:48,790
arm I'll give you kind of a concrete
example outta my own practice with

986
01:01:48,790 --> 01:01:53,860
with projection for example you know
everybody can see how these things are

987
01:01:53,860 --> 01:01:55,330
intended to be done

988
01:01:55,330 --> 01:01:58,860
right you you project them flat on the
wall

989
01:01:58,860 --> 01:02:01,920
so what happens when you project them on
the floor

990
01:02:01,920 --> 01:02:05,910
or what happens when you project them
onto a topological

991
01:02:05,910 --> 01:02:09,370
surface that has some complexity or what
happens when you

992
01:02:09,370 --> 01:02:14,160
project two things into the same space
I'm not in use Lee or what happens when

993
01:02:14,160 --> 01:02:15,240
you

994
01:02:15,240 --> 01:02:19,320
are look into the projector rather than
look at the projection

995
01:02:19,320 --> 01:02:22,850
all these are the all these are serious
questions that don't have answers into

996
01:02:22,850 --> 01:02:23,339
you

997
01:02:23,340 --> 01:02:27,760
until you try them and that begins to
inform

998
01:02:27,760 --> 01:02:31,970
I how stories told it begins to inform
meaning metaphor

999
01:02:31,970 --> 01:02:35,420
things like that arm in unexpected ways

1000
01:02:35,420 --> 01:02:39,330
and you know I don't really

1001
01:02:39,330 --> 01:02:45,490
think too much about that because if you
think too hard about the outcome

1002
01:02:45,490 --> 01:02:47,480
you know that's usually when it failed
