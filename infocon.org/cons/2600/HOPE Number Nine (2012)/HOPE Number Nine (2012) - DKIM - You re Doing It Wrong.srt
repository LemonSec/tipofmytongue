1
00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:03,230
which is a you now signing protocol

2
00:00:03,230 --> 00:00:08,019
I it's frequently used Wii

3
00:00:08,019 --> 00:00:11,250
week he's so I'm gonna show you

4
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:16,350
break those and a I'm trying to get my
presentation software

5
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:23,350
running

6
00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:36,490
I swear this was working fine 15 minutes
ago

7
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:19,760
okay

8
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:22,910
so de Cannes is an email saying protocol

9
00:01:22,910 --> 00:01:28,570
it's different from a signature
protocols may be familiar with

10
00:01:28,570 --> 00:01:31,880
like GP GP TP you or estline

11
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:35,940
GPG is a user-based signing

12
00:01:35,940 --> 00:01:39,429
protocol it's based on the weather trust
model

13
00:01:39,430 --> 00:01:44,200
so user a asserts user be is who they
say they are

14
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:47,619
and you get for whole bunch more people
doing at

15
00:01:47,619 --> 00:01:50,800
and that's a valid the signatures

16
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:55,380
and tough I'm sorry

17
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:59,259
I s mine is

18
00:01:59,259 --> 00:02:02,470
a lot more like SSL you have certificate
authorities

19
00:02:02,470 --> 00:02:06,649
issuing certificates to users

20
00:02:06,649 --> 00:02:13,649
and

21
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:23,170
really sorry you can't hear

22
00:02:23,170 --> 00:02:30,170
I don't have my sights on that

23
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:39,300
okay but Deacon is different its

24
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:43,390
domain level signing see your mail
server is doing all of the signing

25
00:02:43,390 --> 00:02:47,580
for you its

26
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:51,820
the goals are very different most in the
users using it for deliverability

27
00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:55,410
that means they

28
00:02:55,410 --> 00:02:58,570
want to make sure they're you know
doesn't cut get caught by spam filters

29
00:02:58,570 --> 00:03:02,920
so consequently if it works ship it

30
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:08,500
is exactly what happens with it whereas

31
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:12,210
stuff like cheap uggs mine usually

32
00:03:12,210 --> 00:03:16,560
its hurt to get it insecure

33
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:23,180
the defaults are all saying

34
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:30,180
and

35
00:03:31,239 --> 00:03:38,239
okay these are not my way this is site
is a good friend of mine

36
00:03:42,020 --> 00:03:45,910
device like the plan to stop okay

37
00:03:45,910 --> 00:03:50,349
you can internet stalk on my own and not
necessarily those

38
00:03:50,349 --> 00:03:53,930
voices in my head or anybody else don't
be a jerk

39
00:03:53,930 --> 00:03:57,489
and Michael here tonight

40
00:03:57,489 --> 00:04:04,489
is to raise awareness and get some
problems fixed

41
00:04:06,740 --> 00:04:07,210
I

42
00:04:07,210 --> 00:04:10,300
as everybody knows email is really easy
to forage

43
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:13,340
its on the level love writing

44
00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:17,380
ally in return address on a postcard

45
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:23,080
I its

46
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:28,539
organization all so you don't have
individual users claiming responsibility

47
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:30,780
for messages you have the organization

48
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:34,750
asserting that they did send it ants

49
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:38,240
its use with white Mustang techniques so

50
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:42,210
you have reputation tight sealing secure
IP address

51
00:04:42,210 --> 00:04:46,010
your domain name in a way that is not
really forged

52
00:04:46,010 --> 00:04:49,159
I okay curies terrible acronyms

53
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:53,790
slide I I'll let you read that

54
00:04:53,790 --> 00:04:58,000
real quick and move on interesting
things I

55
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,300
I sputtered you missed it this part
already

56
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:05,910
but everything I didn't mention is

57
00:05:05,910 --> 00:05:09,630
there's SMTP s which is

58
00:05:09,630 --> 00:05:13,200
SMTP with SSL and SMTP we start TLS

59
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:16,780
which is that's where

60
00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:21,090
your communications airplane tax and
then you upgrade the session SSL

61
00:05:21,090 --> 00:05:25,360
those things are used for encryption
over the wire

62
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:29,310
only it does not protect the message
contact from anything other than

63
00:05:29,310 --> 00:05:30,030
eavesdropping

64
00:05:30,030 --> 00:05:34,270
I 30

65
00:05:34,270 --> 00:05:37,690
but this third parties are often trusted

66
00:05:37,690 --> 00:05:40,820
with Deakin keys for domain names I'll

67
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:46,580
usually busy email marketing companies
the other interesting

68
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:50,260
thing is your email provider maybe

69
00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:56,330
signing your e-mail for you I'll think

70
00:05:56,330 --> 00:06:00,159
I know Google does its I

71
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:04,100
actually know some people they had a

72
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:08,600
ni harassing and the email and it got to
the point where they called the cops

73
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:12,140
on court got involved and

74
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:16,080
the guy was claiming oh i din can't
prove I sent those emails

75
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:19,169
will Google signs of your outgoing email
with the cam

76
00:06:19,169 --> 00:06:22,630
from it's right there

77
00:06:22,630 --> 00:06:27,000
that's something to be aware of at

78
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:31,220
right

79
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:34,800
so if you want to set up the cam the
first thing you need

80
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:39,690
is an RCT pair then you choose what's
known as a selector

81
00:06:39,690 --> 00:06:43,120
this is just an arbitrary string it's a
label for years

82
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:47,120
then you set up your DNS records

83
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:51,860
I'm gonna show you how that works in a
few minutes you configure the

84
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:55,620
and mail server with that's like trying
private key: civic

85
00:06:55,620 --> 00:07:00,510
it can properly market messages up I'm
not gonna cover that

86
00:07:00,510 --> 00:07:05,140
because it's different for every mail
server and it's not really interesting

87
00:07:05,140 --> 00:07:08,820
and if you're doing

88
00:07:08,820 --> 00:07:11,820
large-scale outsourcing with

89
00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:15,630
a email parking company they will take
your

90
00:07:15,630 --> 00:07:19,419
email server setup for you because it's
their mail server and others give you a

91
00:07:19,419 --> 00:07:21,180
key thing in putting your DNS

92
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:25,810
receivers verification is pretty trivial

93
00:07:25,810 --> 00:07:31,120
there's a header in the message that you
look for parse it verify the signature

94
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:36,479
nothing super fancy their the

95
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:39,590
header is composed of a series tags:

96
00:07:39,590 --> 00:07:42,640
their key value pairs you have if
version

97
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:47,440
which is just gonna be one have a
signature algorithm it's either Rs a

98
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:49,659
shot water ice 1856

99
00:07:49,659 --> 00:07:53,400
guy I there's

100
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:57,979
a hash the message body in there which
is

101
00:07:57,979 --> 00:08:01,280
a 64 incurred and along with the raw
signature data

102
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:06,080
there's your domain name here: selector

103
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:09,830
and you get high a list header fields
you require

104
00:08:09,830 --> 00:08:13,400
so but the standard talks

105
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:16,909
about the selection at the

106
00:08:16,909 --> 00:08:20,190
hair fields that you include being

107
00:08:20,190 --> 00:08:24,940
non-obvious the only one that's actually
required is the from address that the

108
00:08:24,940 --> 00:08:25,659
only one you

109
00:08:25,659 --> 00:08:29,990
include is the from address and you're
signing your e-mail like that and

110
00:08:29,990 --> 00:08:32,370
somebody can just take that signature
header

111
00:08:32,370 --> 00:08:36,409
and as long as the from address is the
same signature remains valid

112
00:08:36,409 --> 00:08:39,450
obviously you don't want that so

113
00:08:39,450 --> 00:08:43,729
generally running through your message
body your day your subjects

114
00:08:43,729 --> 00:08:47,750
your to lying miscellaneous other
headers

115
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:51,440
the other thing you can do is list and

116
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:55,190
your head or less headers that are not
present that asserts

117
00:08:55,190 --> 00:08:58,450
absence that header you could do that to
you

118
00:08:58,450 --> 00:09:02,360
stay insure that somebody doesn't add a

119
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:05,990
auto reply suppression hair

120
00:09:05,990 --> 00:09:10,550
or something like that to your message
in re send it

121
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:14,850
you can also last the same header more
than once

122
00:09:14,850 --> 00:09:18,790
in there which can prevent additional
headers from being appended

123
00:09:18,790 --> 00:09:22,990
if you only included once you can add
more haters at the safety

124
00:09:22,990 --> 00:09:26,430
same pipe only the first one will be
considered but if you have and plus

125
00:09:26,430 --> 00:09:29,529
one you

126
00:09:29,529 --> 00:09:32,890
your hash will include a value that

127
00:09:32,890 --> 00:09:37,040
says you know I try to hash this twice
the second time was

128
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:42,490
absent and there will be no

129
00:09:42,490 --> 00:09:46,880
this is an example signature better

130
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:50,149
the swine covers headers from to

131
00:09:50,149 --> 00:09:54,270
subject dates the mine headers

132
00:09:54,270 --> 00:09:57,540
that stuff I think super interesting
there but that's fine

133
00:09:57,540 --> 00:10:01,750
what looks like

134
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:04,890
the text records just like

135
00:10:04,890 --> 00:10:07,959
email headers are tag-based you have
again

136
00:10:07,959 --> 00:10:13,380
key/value pairs most of them are
optional and rarely present

137
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:17,120
the really interesting wines are the

138
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:20,260
likes the old on there are some other
values the day

139
00:10:20,260 --> 00:10:23,279
I'm not mentioning in there but

140
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:26,890
never use them but the test like is
interesting

141
00:10:26,890 --> 00:10:29,980
the test flight specifies the you're
just testing he can

142
00:10:29,980 --> 00:10:33,430
and anybody processing your mail

143
00:10:33,430 --> 00:10:40,430
must not treat those messages
differently from unsigned male

144
00:10:40,630 --> 00:10:44,670
that'll be interesting here in a minute
got a public key data

145
00:10:44,670 --> 00:10:47,839
obviously and

146
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:54,440
mean you can read my site there's
nothing else terribly interesting here

147
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:59,930
here is one wakes you create a key pair
offices using open SSL

148
00:10:59,930 --> 00:11:03,510
which is my preferred tool for

149
00:11:03,510 --> 00:11:07,270
doing such things there are other tools
having

150
00:11:07,270 --> 00:11:10,839
looked into that into too much detail

151
00:11:10,839 --> 00:11:13,880
what's out there what the defaults for
them are

152
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:18,529
but that there's an example

153
00:11:18,529 --> 00:11:22,450
DNS record up there that one has the
version

154
00:11:22,450 --> 00:11:26,430
the key type and the public key data

155
00:11:26,430 --> 00:11:30,230
once you've done that here in your
configuring your mail server

156
00:11:30,230 --> 00:11:34,920
that information

157
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:38,410
there is another protocol called of a
game and signing

158
00:11:38,410 --> 00:11:42,020
practices which never really got off the
ground

159
00:11:42,020 --> 00:11:46,110
the idea ways a domain name could
specify a

160
00:11:46,110 --> 00:11:50,130
what they're signing practices are for
email using teakamp

161
00:11:50,130 --> 00:11:54,560
you can say I don't know if my mail is
going to be signed

162
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:57,970
you can say I sign all of my mail

163
00:11:57,970 --> 00:12:01,769
and you can say I sign all of my mail
and not only that

164
00:12:01,769 --> 00:12:05,420
if you see anything I didn't sign fees
threw it on the floor

165
00:12:05,420 --> 00:12:08,439
that knowledge

166
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:12,600
the author the standard now advocates
instead of this standard

167
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:15,709
you should passed around privately s

168
00:12:15,709 --> 00:12:19,070
the email

169
00:12:19,070 --> 00:12:23,769
have domain names that actually know
what they're doing

170
00:12:23,769 --> 00:12:27,339
on for example I found

171
00:12:27,339 --> 00:12:31,480
that the of you has an 80 S P discard
record set

172
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:35,200
which means you should throw away all
their emailed its on-site

173
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:38,980
they also use test he's in production

174
00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:42,700
so all of their male is set out to the
key that said you

175
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:46,080
says you should not treat this
differently from unsigned male

176
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:51,440
and their signing practices policy says
that they want everybody to throw that

177
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:52,030
email

178
00:12:52,030 --> 00:12:55,740
on the floor so if your mail server
accepts mail from them and

179
00:12:55,740 --> 00:13:02,740
isn't many standard

180
00:13:05,679 --> 00:13:09,069
yes ya who was one of the authors and
that he can't stand it this one other

181
00:13:09,069 --> 00:13:10,110
engineers is

182
00:13:10,110 --> 00:13:13,199
listed in the standards and they still
got it wrong

183
00:13:13,199 --> 00:13:19,809
%uh that will be a theme tonight the so

184
00:13:19,809 --> 00:13:24,860
there's nothing inherently broken

185
00:13:24,860 --> 00:13:27,929
that he can it's just that getting it
right is part

186
00:13:27,929 --> 00:13:32,269
and its getting it right is the
exception

187
00:13:32,269 --> 00:13:35,350
basically the only organization the day
seen

188
00:13:35,350 --> 00:13:39,790
that I would consider to not be doing
anything silly is Facebook

189
00:13:39,790 --> 00:13:44,349
I'm not really a fan on Facebook but
somebody call them out on their blog

190
00:13:44,350 --> 00:13:48,739
that screwing it up and they stop
screwing up gay Facebook

191
00:13:48,739 --> 00:13:53,239
for something I key rotation

192
00:13:53,239 --> 00:13:56,279
is something that specified in the
standard

193
00:13:56,279 --> 00:14:00,369
because smaller keyser often use

194
00:14:00,369 --> 00:14:03,759
so they say oh well it's okay if you use

195
00:14:03,759 --> 00:14:07,799
smaller keys because they don't need a
long lifetime

196
00:14:07,799 --> 00:14:11,079
you can you can exchange key every
couple of months

197
00:14:11,079 --> 00:14:14,290
a

198
00:14:14,290 --> 00:14:17,929
yeah expecting people to do things

199
00:14:17,929 --> 00:14:21,809
after they've got something set up and
working

200
00:14:21,809 --> 00:14:25,618
you're gonna lose that every single time

201
00:14:25,619 --> 00:14:28,980
third-party mailer mailing services

202
00:14:28,980 --> 00:14:33,149
mentioned earlier of and provide keys to
customers customers

203
00:14:33,149 --> 00:14:37,110
don't audit those keys they don't check
to see whether that mailing service has

204
00:14:37,110 --> 00:14:38,980
used that he adds

205
00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:42,860
fifty other customers for example

206
00:14:42,860 --> 00:14:48,549
and the protocol

207
00:14:48,549 --> 00:14:51,959
is described as not particularly the
security sensitive

208
00:14:51,959 --> 00:14:56,899
but because it's used for whitelisting
and reputation techniques

209
00:14:56,899 --> 00:15:00,740
a lot a trusted domain names

210
00:15:00,740 --> 00:15:05,379
30 came signs the spam filters will let
anything through

211
00:15:05,379 --> 00:15:08,919
as long as he's got a valid Deacon
signature that's a lot of fun

212
00:15:08,919 --> 00:15:13,850
I even if I and if anybody's familiar
with

213
00:15:13,850 --> 00:15:16,899
spf its it allows you to you

214
00:15:16,899 --> 00:15:20,059
the text record and your domain name
that says what IP addresses are going to

215
00:15:20,059 --> 00:15:20,969
use to send mail

216
00:15:20,970 --> 00:15:25,689
so you can say so I only use this IP
address to send mail

217
00:15:25,689 --> 00:15:29,529
and if you see anything from a different
IP address its a forgery and you should

218
00:15:29,529 --> 00:15:30,610
drop it on the floor

219
00:15:30,610 --> 00:15:33,749
but I have

220
00:15:33,749 --> 00:15:37,490
seen a couple services which will take

221
00:15:37,490 --> 00:15:40,799
Deakin signature as over right for that
and

222
00:15:40,799 --> 00:15:47,799
for them a long anyway site

223
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:57,680
right the even if the even if the SPF
policy is heart fail

224
00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:00,760
the D Kim will work anyway so how we
curry

225
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:07,100
kids 384 big he is which anybody who
uses they should be punched in the face

226
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:11,820
really his hi

227
00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:17,550
think the first time somebody broke a
384 bit he was one of the RS a challenge

228
00:16:17,550 --> 00:16:17,950
numbers

229
00:16:17,950 --> 00:16:21,080
RCA the company you

230
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:25,810
was started by the guys who invented
this algorithm they released a major

231
00:16:25,810 --> 00:16:29,310
challenge numbers to test the security
of our Sadies to be prize money

232
00:16:29,310 --> 00:16:34,840
catch to it back in nineteen ninety 92
or 94

233
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:38,220
somebody broke 384 be

234
00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:41,980
in a couple months with if you can
Gators I

235
00:16:41,980 --> 00:16:45,920
that was a big deal at the time but it's
almost

236
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:50,700
two decades later why is anybody still
using

237
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:53,730
512 vicki's and

238
00:16:53,730 --> 00:16:56,940
thousand-dollar PC

239
00:16:56,940 --> 00:17:00,430
I am high and core i7

240
00:17:00,430 --> 00:17:03,690
will will cut through these and 3-4
weeks

241
00:17:03,690 --> 00:17:07,860
an interesting thing and that the
algorithms necessary

242
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:12,850
to you break RCA is that that the
algorithm depends only on the site at

243
00:17:12,849 --> 00:17:13,419
the key

244
00:17:13,420 --> 00:17:17,160
so there's no getting lucky and getting
it fast or getting i'm looking getting

245
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:17,890
it slow

246
00:17:17,890 --> 00:17:21,939
pretty much every key at the same size
will take very close to the same amount

247
00:17:21,939 --> 00:17:22,949
of time to break

248
00:17:22,949 --> 00:17:26,680
512 ickies I

249
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:31,560
based on my own back at the and look
calculations online

250
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:35,840
how much it took to you breaky on ec2

251
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:39,179
I'm guessing you could spend one to two
million dollars

252
00:17:39,180 --> 00:17:42,690
to break EN 8768 bikini

253
00:17:42,690 --> 00:17:46,300
NEC to bit is not a lot of people using
is pretty cam

254
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:49,840
but 1024 bikinis

255
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:53,740
one of the guys who invented arce

256
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:57,010
that paper talking about the cost a
cracking those

257
00:17:57,010 --> 00:18:00,070
in 2003 he was estimating

258
00:18:00,070 --> 00:18:03,320
with custom hardware you could do it for
about

259
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:06,939
ten million dollars in hardware costs

260
00:18:06,940 --> 00:18:12,030
plus twenty million dollars and design
costs but this is almost a decade ago

261
00:18:12,030 --> 00:18:16,440
a lot has changed an manufacturing since
that

262
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:20,960
on the for numbers here

263
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:25,510
the RecA 768 challenge number which was
cracked I think about him

264
00:18:25,510 --> 00:18:30,470
years ago they spent 15,000 core years

265
00:18:30,470 --> 00:18:33,820
on it but

266
00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:37,300
a large botnet can be 30,000

267
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:42,610
hosts 2768

268
00:18:42,610 --> 00:18:48,759
vicki's either yes

269
00:18:48,759 --> 00:18:51,219
yet honest says the you should not be
using

270
00:18:51,219 --> 00:18:57,499
she's smaller than 2048 bit for anything
now

271
00:18:57,499 --> 00:19:00,589
I am I'm getting sick that

272
00:19:00,589 --> 00:19:06,029
on the slide so

273
00:19:06,029 --> 00:19:09,450
why would people use the shitty keys

274
00:19:09,450 --> 00:19:12,589
DNS

275
00:19:12,589 --> 00:19:15,678
has been around since the dawn of the
Internet pretty much

276
00:19:15,679 --> 00:19:20,070
it's a 30-year-old protocol dial-up was
the norm when it was invented

277
00:19:20,070 --> 00:19:24,889
and dial-up had a maximum transmission
unit

278
00:19:24,889 --> 00:19:29,249
576 bytes see you had your IP header

279
00:19:29,249 --> 00:19:34,269
your YouTube he had her and then your
DNS response metal had to finish .500

280
00:19:34,269 --> 00:19:37,979
76 bytes to work well so

281
00:19:37,979 --> 00:19:41,559
there and it down to five minutes of
bytes thats E maximum size

282
00:19:41,559 --> 00:19:45,619
the DNS packet ever you P I

283
00:19:45,619 --> 00:19:49,488
a 2048 picky because the

284
00:19:49,489 --> 00:19:52,879
the base64 encoding overhead

285
00:19:52,879 --> 00:19:56,019
the S&OP one including overhead

286
00:19:56,019 --> 00:20:00,979
all of that stuff and not only do you
have to include

287
00:20:00,979 --> 00:20:04,539
the raw module is there's also a public
exponent you have to include

288
00:20:04,539 --> 00:20:08,979
you get really close to that limit with
even a 2048 picky

289
00:20:08,979 --> 00:20:13,059
and a 4096 pick you up to so

290
00:20:13,059 --> 00:20:17,678
people when they were reading at the
standard they worried about that

291
00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:21,639
that's one of the reasons smaller he's a
comment in fact the standard is not

292
00:20:21,639 --> 00:20:26,299
even require verifiers to support keys
larger than 2048

293
00:20:26,299 --> 00:20:30,869
I CA's I think in the last couple years

294
00:20:30,869 --> 00:20:34,178
view given this year's a lot of shit but

295
00:20:34,179 --> 00:20:38,059
at least 80 keep most people from doing

296
00:20:38,059 --> 00:20:45,059
painfully stupid things they have some
news

297
00:20:47,730 --> 00:20:51,200
and week he's a faster if you are
sending

298
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:54,940
outs an email to you

299
00:20:54,940 --> 00:20:58,360
every single one of your customers kinda
knowing

300
00:20:58,360 --> 00:21:02,759
bit you also want that to go fast
smokey's

301
00:21:02,759 --> 00:21:08,190
cute faster people like

302
00:21:08,190 --> 00:21:14,429
fast email delivery and the other
standard was designed with modest

303
00:21:14,429 --> 00:21:18,029
security because nobody really cares
about this and as long as my email is

304
00:21:18,029 --> 00:21:21,179
going through all of my customers I
don't care yeah

305
00:21:21,179 --> 00:21:28,179
so what have we gotten the wild ebookers
they mentioned about Facebook

306
00:21:30,940 --> 00:21:34,070
the link is up there if you want to read
it I

307
00:21:34,070 --> 00:21:38,529
this guy span seventy days trying to
crack their fight for Vicky

308
00:21:38,529 --> 00:21:41,669
gave up posted on his blog about it

309
00:21:41,669 --> 00:21:48,009
they fixed it there was a follow-up blog
article for somebody's Cisco

310
00:21:48,009 --> 00:21:52,340
Osisko by IronPort systems a few years
back

311
00:21:52,340 --> 00:21:55,418
which is a spam filter planes companies
so they've got

312
00:21:55,419 --> 00:21:58,899
alleged test data that's

313
00:21:58,899 --> 00:22:03,980
tests that some in the wild data from
the systems they have

314
00:22:03,980 --> 00:22:08,289
but it's two years old I unfortunately
not have access to you

315
00:22:08,289 --> 00:22:12,549
mail servers that process email for
thousands of people are tens of

316
00:22:12,549 --> 00:22:13,889
thousands of people so

317
00:22:13,889 --> 00:22:17,870
made it is not as good but I read it to
a party can scrape

318
00:22:17,870 --> 00:22:20,940
which will connect when I am that
mailbox and pull all the

319
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:24,659
BT cam headers out its I'm I did this

320
00:22:24,659 --> 00:22:27,789
against my gmail account and

321
00:22:27,789 --> 00:22:31,970
gmail account a couple friends and I
found some interesting things

322
00:22:31,970 --> 00:22:35,480
anybody heard of a company called

323
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:39,139
epsilon interactive I

324
00:22:39,139 --> 00:22:43,009
early last year they were the ones who
had a massive

325
00:22:43,009 --> 00:22:47,419
email preach they had email lists for

326
00:22:47,419 --> 00:22:51,000
many customers stolen and

327
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:55,350
those have been actively used for spam I
A

328
00:22:55,350 --> 00:22:59,909
there were a lot of notifications that
went out to affected customers some

329
00:22:59,909 --> 00:23:02,029
companies didn't notify their customers

330
00:23:02,029 --> 00:23:05,360
cases you don't have to

331
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:08,580
but now

332
00:23:08,580 --> 00:23:11,759
I would wager most in the people in this
room

333
00:23:11,759 --> 00:23:17,549
our customer at a company that was
affected by this speech I

334
00:23:17,549 --> 00:23:21,940
currently they have moved out their
customers to 1024 picky

335
00:23:21,940 --> 00:23:26,519
and I the its unique per customer i cant
recall at the moment

336
00:23:26,519 --> 00:23:29,940
but the old 384 bikini

337
00:23:29,940 --> 00:23:33,730
is still there they were notified about
this nine months ago

338
00:23:33,730 --> 00:23:37,450
didn't fix it cell I'm calling them out
on that

339
00:23:37,450 --> 00:23:41,590
I yeah

340
00:23:41,590 --> 00:23:45,869
their customers include several very
large

341
00:23:45,869 --> 00:23:50,919
banks several brokerages luxury hotel
chains

342
00:23:50,919 --> 00:23:55,940
those are some enticing targets for
somebody who wants to run a phishing

343
00:23:55,940 --> 00:23:56,700
campaign

344
00:23:56,700 --> 00:24:03,139
is also a large dial up by asking the
united states that uses the same

345
00:24:03,139 --> 00:24:07,029
384 bit key for every ISP's domain name

346
00:24:07,029 --> 00:24:10,320
that they've ever bought which is well
over a hundred

347
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:13,799
I am NOT mistake which one

348
00:24:13,799 --> 00:24:16,869
but I think there's few

349
00:24:16,869 --> 00:24:20,950
possibilities left I

350
00:24:20,950 --> 00:24:24,210
you can help out where some %uh the ones
that were pushing

351
00:24:24,210 --> 00:24:27,830
this standard because by if you get on
the internet a while

352
00:24:27,830 --> 00:24:31,500
you're a member at that there was lots
of fishing for

353
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:35,230
you gain hey pal because pic mail
accounts

354
00:24:35,230 --> 00:24:38,879
well they had money they're attached
bank accounts the train them and I need

355
00:24:38,879 --> 00:24:39,460
a

356
00:24:39,460 --> 00:24:43,779
you could cell something that you don't
actually have

357
00:24:43,779 --> 00:24:48,529
get paid ran off with the money and but
I'm anybody it's wise to wait you're

358
00:24:48,529 --> 00:24:49,230
long gone

359
00:24:49,230 --> 00:24:53,750
so both of them have accounts that are
very valuable I

360
00:24:53,750 --> 00:24:57,049
I A through my

361
00:24:57,049 --> 00:25:01,418
deacons great program kinda 512 dickey's

362
00:25:01,419 --> 00:25:04,510
thats there no longer using

363
00:25:04,510 --> 00:25:08,440
but they have not removed it for DNS I
and II emailed them two months ago

364
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:12,539
to point this out to them didn't remove
it I cracked it

365
00:25:12,539 --> 00:25:16,359
X fun so

366
00:25:16,359 --> 00:25:19,710
that key the other interesting thing
about it is

367
00:25:19,710 --> 00:25:24,260
that was a test key I remember what I
said earlier that s keys

368
00:25:24,260 --> 00:25:29,340
there to be treated at any email signed
with a test key is to be treated as if

369
00:25:29,340 --> 00:25:33,119
it was unsigned Eve and paper how r

370
00:25:33,119 --> 00:25:36,269
about the only companies that are
Whiteley

371
00:25:36,269 --> 00:25:40,139
actually

372
00:25:40,139 --> 00:25:45,100
where the actual practices to you drop
an email from them that is unsigned

373
00:25:45,100 --> 00:25:51,240
so this happened

374
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:55,359
I got that 32 my a gmail account

375
00:25:55,359 --> 00:25:58,639
there's a nice little is a in Google
Labs there's an option

376
00:25:58,639 --> 00:26:02,480
you can go that will nice little key
icon

377
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:06,460
next to you budget in an email that he
signed with the cam

378
00:26:06,460 --> 00:26:09,769
this only works for you can take power
right now so its

379
00:26:09,769 --> 00:26:13,820
it's really fun that I got it and

380
00:26:13,820 --> 00:26:19,879
that that doesn't really that looks like
you is actually from the date nako

381
00:26:19,879 --> 00:26:24,899
totally Vijay okay but here's a little
more

382
00:26:24,899 --> 00:26:28,779
gmail see you I if you if you click the
little

383
00:26:28,779 --> 00:26:32,609
Info button it all say signed by datacom

384
00:26:32,609 --> 00:26:36,908
on this went straight into my inbox and
was Mark's as important

385
00:26:36,909 --> 00:26:41,549
very important very important
opportunity to

386
00:26:41,549 --> 00:26:44,700
for natural male enhancement okay

387
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:48,379
so thats

388
00:26:48,379 --> 00:26:52,529
thats a showing off how do we crack keys

389
00:26:52,529 --> 00:26:55,889
so for stuff going to take a few minutes
to you talk about

390
00:26:55,889 --> 00:26:59,529
arce works this is really basic

391
00:26:59,529 --> 00:27:03,250
the Wikipedia article has a lot more
detail if you're interested in how it

392
00:27:03,250 --> 00:27:03,750
works

393
00:27:03,750 --> 00:27:07,250
but the relevant stuff for this talk

394
00:27:07,250 --> 00:27:11,080
first of it's an asymmetric algorithm
which means there's a public and private

395
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:11,830
key

396
00:27:11,830 --> 00:27:15,710
give everybody the public key that's
cool long as you keep your private key

397
00:27:15,710 --> 00:27:16,580
private

398
00:27:16,580 --> 00:27:20,019
the public he is made up a two numbers
and which is called

399
00:27:20,019 --> 00:27:24,549
the Model S and E which is the public
exponent

400
00:27:24,549 --> 00:27:28,190
the private key has three additional
numbers P&Q

401
00:27:28,190 --> 00:27:31,549
which are two large primes

402
00:27:31,549 --> 00:27:36,190
that are approximately the the square
root but the modulars

403
00:27:36,190 --> 00:27:39,940
the model is generated by multiplying
the Aztecs numbers together

404
00:27:39,940 --> 00:27:43,039
and d on

405
00:27:43,039 --> 00:27:46,389
is equation up there d

406
00:27:46,389 --> 00:27:49,559
can be a ripe derived from E

407
00:27:49,559 --> 00:27:53,539
P&Q if you have those three numbers

408
00:27:53,539 --> 00:27:57,779
there is an algorithm that will
efficiently determine d

409
00:27:57,779 --> 00:28:01,659
if you have the restive the numbers I am
NOT going to get into it

410
00:28:01,659 --> 00:28:04,669
peco's open SSL

411
00:28:04,669 --> 00:28:09,359
has that built in if you want to make
you a custom parameters

412
00:28:09,359 --> 00:28:14,689
so that leaves us with P&Q as the two
important numbers that we would need to

413
00:28:14,690 --> 00:28:15,940
find

414
00:28:15,940 --> 00:28:20,350
and we can do this by factoring in much
less

415
00:28:20,350 --> 00:28:25,279
now 512 the keys that a hundred and
fifty five digit number

416
00:28:25,279 --> 00:28:29,049
that is a lot of work to factor as I
mentioned earlier it said

417
00:28:29,049 --> 00:28:32,580
my PC 22 days to find it

418
00:28:32,580 --> 00:28:36,178
so how do we do this there's an
everythin called the general number

419
00:28:36,179 --> 00:28:38,590
field sieve

420
00:28:38,590 --> 00:28:43,580
I A have to admit here iight don't
really understand how it works

421
00:28:43,580 --> 00:28:48,199
I one of my friends told me that I was a
map script kiddie and he's right

422
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:54,659
bytes that's okay I think everybody with
a script kiddie something one day

423
00:28:54,659 --> 00:28:58,869
and I'm trying to learn more there's a
venture open source tools

424
00:28:58,869 --> 00:29:02,070
that do bits and pieces at this out for
them various

425
00:29:02,070 --> 00:29:06,139
a bunch of stages to it it's really
complicated

426
00:29:06,139 --> 00:29:09,769
some people there was a perl script that
was written while ago

427
00:29:09,769 --> 00:29:13,779
with mostly works somebody way better
python script

428
00:29:13,779 --> 00:29:19,149
it automates running all the tools
necessary to you perform the Outrigger

429
00:29:19,149 --> 00:29:23,190
key conversion is still tedious going
from an RS a public key

430
00:29:23,190 --> 00:29:29,480
getting my Julius out a bit takes a bit
of work

431
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:34,399
the open SSL tools that you can use to
pull the module is that a public key

432
00:29:34,399 --> 00:29:40,839
you hacks you have to feed it to these
tools and ethanol

433
00:29:40,839 --> 00:29:44,279
and then even more tedious is to turn
the factors

434
00:29:44,279 --> 00:29:47,500
into a private key I could not actually
find a program to do this

435
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:51,270
I a for a very small perl script but

436
00:29:51,270 --> 00:29:54,450
I am I'll see that in a bit

437
00:29:54,450 --> 00:29:58,770
if you 12 try fact himself

438
00:29:58,770 --> 00:30:02,200
there is a great tutorial on using the
Python script

439
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:05,480
there's a bench dependencies to set up

440
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:08,820
but if you can follow a how-to

441
00:30:08,820 --> 00:30:12,529
and you have a Linux box it's pretty
easy I think the Indian people

442
00:30:12,529 --> 00:30:15,690
Windows binaries if you wanna do that

443
00:30:15,690 --> 00:30:19,570
and that is how you would convert eighty
can text record

444
00:30:19,570 --> 00:30:23,710
to a much less except for the step where
you turn it into de small

445
00:30:23,710 --> 00:30:27,700
I N they look funny oh now

446
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:31,980
I don't think so so

447
00:30:31,980 --> 00:30:35,429
I am when I ways testing this out

448
00:30:35,429 --> 00:30:39,450
Iran's commands like that I ate pops
nigel is in the pipeline

449
00:30:39,450 --> 00:30:44,029
and hacks which happens to do a great
job of converting our checks a decimal

450
00:30:44,029 --> 00:30:47,320
numbers into regular decimal numbers

451
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:52,269
if Icahn you save it to you file called
she got and

452
00:30:52,269 --> 00:30:55,349
and year and out as a type on my side

453
00:30:55,349 --> 00:31:00,158
okay you're in. seconds I

454
00:31:00,159 --> 00:31:03,619
with the the word file name is a

455
00:31:03,619 --> 00:31:10,519
parameter and of it goes and then you
wait a while

456
00:31:10,519 --> 00:31:14,190
I played around with doing this on ec2
BK's

457
00:31:14,190 --> 00:31:17,899
I A had a nother key that I wanted to
crack

458
00:31:17,899 --> 00:31:23,490
this presentation and it wasn't going to
finish in time

459
00:31:23,490 --> 00:31:27,049
the the set up for that is fairly simple

460
00:31:27,049 --> 00:31:30,889
you can run the polynomial selection
phase of the algorithm

461
00:31:30,889 --> 00:31:36,279
thats it's the first phase polynomial
selection

462
00:31:36,279 --> 00:31:40,460
the CFA's news

463
00:31:40,460 --> 00:31:43,710
some post-processing where you build up
a huge matrix

464
00:31:43,710 --> 00:31:46,710
relations found in the city Phase and

465
00:31:46,710 --> 00:31:51,809
you news when I saw her on that

466
00:31:51,809 --> 00:31:56,269
and so read that on my PC

467
00:31:56,269 --> 00:32:00,649
uploaded the polynomial that came out of
that phase

468
00:32:00,649 --> 00:32:03,760
to you an ec2 instance

469
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:06,970
heights are never mentioned cluster
compute spot instances

470
00:32:06,970 --> 00:32:10,559
I and a half million people are with

471
00:32:10,559 --> 00:32:15,639
ec2 they have a system where you can bid
on spare capacity in the system

472
00:32:15,639 --> 00:32:19,470
which will let you get a resource that
normally costs

473
00:32:19,470 --> 00:32:23,179
250 an hour for 25 cents an hour as long
is

474
00:32:23,179 --> 00:32:26,919
you don't mind having its shut down on
announced if somebody wants to pay more

475
00:32:26,919 --> 00:32:28,750
than you

476
00:32:28,750 --> 00:32:32,720
for this that's fine so

477
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:35,919
you get one note that all the master
were

478
00:32:35,919 --> 00:32:40,230
the computation an image slave nodes I
did this for 16 instances

479
00:32:40,230 --> 00:32:43,570
the city phase took about six hours I N

480
00:32:43,570 --> 00:32:47,309
cost me about a hundred dollars

481
00:32:47,309 --> 00:32:50,309
hundred dollars is totally worth it if
you're going to be doing a phishing

482
00:32:50,309 --> 00:32:53,658
campaign

483
00:32:53,659 --> 00:32:57,789
I you do have to kind of the 88 I A
didn't see a way to get it so I'm

484
00:32:57,789 --> 00:32:59,799
actually stop my extra instances

485
00:32:59,799 --> 00:33:04,839
thanks sensors are costing me several
dollars an hour I A

486
00:33:04,839 --> 00:33:07,940
we did around in shutting off and then

487
00:33:07,940 --> 00:33:11,700
you got your post processing

488
00:33:11,700 --> 00:33:15,149
that takes a while by

489
00:33:15,149 --> 00:33:18,210
at least at that point the
post-processing only runs on one

490
00:33:18,210 --> 00:33:19,129
computer

491
00:33:19,129 --> 00:33:23,099
I couldn't find a way to make it run on
multiple computers faster

492
00:33:23,099 --> 00:33:28,470
i think thats limitation at the tools

493
00:33:28,470 --> 00:33:32,769
so read a few programs to

494
00:33:32,769 --> 00:33:37,629
to do stuff the person I wrote was

495
00:33:37,629 --> 00:33:42,039
a program that will take a factorization
and convert it to a private key

496
00:33:42,039 --> 00:33:46,269
given the public key I you can also

497
00:33:46,269 --> 00:33:50,389
easily extract the public key from a
certificate if you're

498
00:33:50,389 --> 00:33:55,799
say I down there was the TI calculator
signing keys that were

499
00:33:55,799 --> 00:33:59,440
cracked a while ago that was a
certificate now to rob public key

500
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:02,970
public easy enough to extract

501
00:34:02,970 --> 00:34:06,359
so you get this to all either the log
file

502
00:34:06,359 --> 00:34:09,389
Tron fact himself or

503
00:34:09,389 --> 00:34:12,879
the raw factor you just one of the
factors is fine

504
00:34:12,879 --> 00:34:17,418
is used by the models by factory get one
it generates about private key file that

505
00:34:17,418 --> 00:34:19,190
you can use

506
00:34:19,190 --> 00:34:23,230
i reprogram called D can scan which

507
00:34:23,230 --> 00:34:28,029
is almost to the level is being in
denial of service tool

508
00:34:28,029 --> 00:34:31,319
packed I A

509
00:34:31,319 --> 00:34:36,040
took the list the selectors I saw from
scraping

510
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:42,619
a few male schools and compiled a word
list with major rules

511
00:34:42,619 --> 00:34:46,319
I've gets an example rules up there

512
00:34:46,319 --> 00:34:49,540
essentially what it does is it can take

513
00:34:49,540 --> 00:34:52,949
forward at a plain weird last and

514
00:34:52,949 --> 00:34:58,118
scandal at those entries but there's
also a couple expansions the you can do

515
00:34:58,119 --> 00:35:01,349
they say numeric range expansion which
can be used

516
00:35:01,349 --> 00:35:04,779
either with or without leading zeros

517
00:35:04,779 --> 00:35:07,960
there and because I read in for all

518
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:14,960
the numeric range expansion operator
also works on letters

519
00:35:16,220 --> 00:35:20,000
really okay I'll

520
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:25,760
a typo nice here

521
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:29,349
anyway the other funding

522
00:35:29,349 --> 00:35:32,680
is there's an expansion rule that will
take the domain name that you're

523
00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:33,740
currently looking at

524
00:35:33,740 --> 00:35:37,869
and slice and dice the parts at that I
saw

525
00:35:37,869 --> 00:35:41,329
a fair number domains that use the
domain name again

526
00:35:41,329 --> 00:35:45,000
as the selector that a fine at get

527
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:48,069
d came down which given a domain name

528
00:35:48,069 --> 00:35:52,650
and a selector will give you get it up
the public eats up there

529
00:35:52,650 --> 00:35:55,780
I this is a test that I set up

530
00:35:55,780 --> 00:35:59,190
this is a 256-bit key

531
00:35:59,190 --> 00:36:02,819
I have not seen any keys that small
actually used in the wilds

532
00:36:02,819 --> 00:36:09,819
but that would be terrible this is like
the test uses a slightly older version

533
00:36:11,380 --> 00:36:12,180
it might well then

534
00:36:12,180 --> 00:36:15,759
the current one will actually list out
whether it's like this tester

535
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:19,650
it's ready for production that's what
the public he looks like

536
00:36:19,650 --> 00:36:23,690
and also got a fingerprint shield their

537
00:36:23,690 --> 00:36:27,680
which is shot one of the public key you
can use that

538
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:32,348
to tell which domain names

539
00:36:32,349 --> 00:36:36,359
are using same public keys if for
example they're using the same marketing

540
00:36:36,359 --> 00:36:37,569
company or

541
00:36:37,569 --> 00:36:40,710
their bench domain names and by the same
company and

542
00:36:40,710 --> 00:36:44,839
they don't care I'm we have D can crack

543
00:36:44,839 --> 00:36:48,980
which is not fun once you get

544
00:36:48,980 --> 00:36:52,280
fact insist that up all you have to do
is

545
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:56,170
gifty can crack the domain name and the
selector and it does everything

546
00:36:56,170 --> 00:36:59,660
it will pull the public yet at the Andaz

547
00:36:59,660 --> 00:37:02,859
extract the module s save it to
configure file

548
00:37:02,859 --> 00:37:07,640
perfect and SIV run fact MC give you a
big estimate how long it's going to

549
00:37:07,640 --> 00:37:08,078
take.

550
00:37:08,079 --> 00:37:12,010
and automatically construct the private
key I A

551
00:37:12,010 --> 00:37:15,020
have a demo that tonight in fact

552
00:37:15,020 --> 00:37:19,420
and then there's D can spoof which will
take that private key

553
00:37:19,420 --> 00:37:22,799
and a well format it email message

554
00:37:22,799 --> 00:37:27,150
animal at Deakin header to that email
message

555
00:37:27,150 --> 00:37:31,569
so that you can use it without setting
up your mail server to you

556
00:37:31,569 --> 00:37:38,569
said okay let's see if my laptop still
hates me

557
00:37:46,460 --> 00:37:53,460
area

558
00:39:00,770 --> 00:39:07,770
I kits to pick

559
00:39:15,350 --> 00:39:22,350
I can everybody read that

560
00:39:25,660 --> 00:39:32,660
I so here's that testimony showed you

561
00:39:47,590 --> 00:39:48,480
out

562
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:53,820
route

563
00:39:53,820 --> 00:40:00,820
I can fix that

564
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:30,550
that's what I get for

565
00:40:30,550 --> 00:40:37,550
not testing this part of the demo

566
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:51,280
well

567
00:41:30,750 --> 00:41:35,040
on benefited ec2 is that their packaging
areas are very very fast

568
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:41,060
Palace

569
00:41:41,060 --> 00:41:44,440
see if I got any other paints

570
00:41:44,440 --> 00:41:51,440
hit

571
00:41:58,100 --> 00:42:00,509
thank you

572
00:42:00,509 --> 00:42:07,509
sorry I'm absolutely terrible typist

573
00:42:08,849 --> 00:42:15,849
okay I will do a different demo than

574
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:26,369
get up on stage in any every single type
a possible

575
00:42:26,369 --> 00:42:30,930
and my computer spends first 10 minutes
not working

576
00:42:30,930 --> 00:42:37,930
okay

577
00:42:40,550 --> 00:42:47,550
that one

578
00:43:07,480 --> 00:43:13,670
affiliates let's see if it works

579
00:43:13,670 --> 00:43:18,000
try this one more time and I will to
another company that actually works

580
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:23,060
okay great so what this would do

581
00:43:23,060 --> 00:43:26,370
if I hadn't been too stupid to set up
all

582
00:43:26,370 --> 00:43:30,549
dependencies ahead of time because I had
been testing is on a different system

583
00:43:30,550 --> 00:43:34,040
I is it will rand

584
00:43:34,040 --> 00:43:38,410
run in Civ this key is Canada rigged lol
because

585
00:43:38,410 --> 00:43:43,240
256-bit key takes about three minutes to
crack

586
00:43:43,240 --> 00:43:46,530
but it'll out the private key

587
00:43:46,530 --> 00:43:49,950
I so I did already to you

588
00:43:49,950 --> 00:43:54,130
a key I anybody familiar with the

589
00:43:54,130 --> 00:43:57,210
black hat security conference it's in
Vegas in about a week

590
00:43:57,210 --> 00:44:00,300
on they

591
00:44:00,300 --> 00:44:03,530
they use an outsource provider to you
hands all

592
00:44:03,530 --> 00:44:07,040
sending out their marketing messages and
these five in each of the key

593
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:14,040
and this was the key that I cracked on
ec21 about eight days

594
00:44:28,100 --> 00:44:31,510
up there we go if you've already cracked
it

595
00:44:31,510 --> 00:44:34,770
it will just poll the factors out at the
log file

596
00:44:34,770 --> 00:44:38,640
and give you the private key directly so
there we have a private key

597
00:44:38,640 --> 00:44:44,379
and let's see if

598
00:44:44,380 --> 00:44:51,380
I am liked my gmail

599
00:44:51,710 --> 00:44:58,710
excellent

600
00:45:13,190 --> 00:45:16,610
okay this is sending it without the
signature

601
00:45:16,610 --> 00:45:20,140
I should get mice

602
00:45:20,140 --> 00:45:25,680
am order ever go

603
00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:29,980
so this went to my spam folder cuz a
shaker in a second

604
00:45:29,980 --> 00:45:33,490
ion spf failed

605
00:45:33,490 --> 00:45:36,670
I in fact at heart failed because

606
00:45:36,670 --> 00:45:40,250
they specify if they don't quite was the
white

607
00:45:40,250 --> 00:45:43,880
IP address its peak I

608
00:45:43,880 --> 00:45:50,880
so

609
00:46:09,910 --> 00:46:16,910
per pair

610
00:46:24,410 --> 00:46:29,200
and that limits my inbox and

611
00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:36,200
I ago

612
00:46:41,589 --> 00:46:45,390
I %uh the second time

613
00:46:45,390 --> 00:46:48,538
I ate use D can spew with that Breivik

614
00:46:48,539 --> 00:46:54,040
what

615
00:46:54,040 --> 00:47:01,040
oh I'm sorry I didn't show original on
ass you're right

616
00:47:07,390 --> 00:47:10,560
so it's got a valid became signature
here on

617
00:47:10,560 --> 00:47:14,670
somewhere in there which I can't see
right now because reasons

618
00:47:14,670 --> 00:47:18,090
it says that he can it should say in
there somewhere that the Deacon

619
00:47:18,090 --> 00:47:18,950
signature is

620
00:47:18,950 --> 00:47:23,700
valid I'll okay

621
00:47:23,700 --> 00:47:26,960
thank you I still can't see it I don't
know why I'm

622
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:31,160
I'm sorry that I had some technical
difficulties with my talk I have a few

623
00:47:31,160 --> 00:47:32,180
minutes for questions

624
00:47:32,180 --> 00:47:38,859
because deaconess a

625
00:47:38,860 --> 00:47:45,860
and trusted huge trusted yet

626
00:47:46,570 --> 00:47:50,330
people screw up SPF all the freaking
time so

627
00:47:50,330 --> 00:47:54,730
I quickly a few other things that I'd
like to do

628
00:47:54,730 --> 00:47:57,800
I been working on some tools to track

629
00:47:57,800 --> 00:48:01,240
key usage over time by monitoring male
schools

630
00:48:01,240 --> 00:48:04,610
see when people read take their keys
when they changed he cited stuff like

631
00:48:04,610 --> 00:48:05,090
that

632
00:48:05,090 --> 00:48:08,090
I at some database supports my tools

633
00:48:08,090 --> 00:48:12,370
integrate DNS service with email servers

634
00:48:12,370 --> 00:48:16,970
so that yet idiot first irritation and

635
00:48:16,970 --> 00:48:20,240
as to how not to screw this up at

636
00:48:20,240 --> 00:48:23,500
use 2048 he's possible

637
00:48:23,500 --> 00:48:28,620
if you can't because they want this 1536

638
00:48:28,620 --> 00:48:33,810
wreck a quarterly should be safe I if
you get screwed doing that it's not my

639
00:48:33,810 --> 00:48:34,430
fault though

640
00:48:34,430 --> 00:48:38,859
but make sure you delete the old keys
make sure you check to see

641
00:48:38,860 --> 00:48:42,560
when your third party mailer is doing
and

642
00:48:42,560 --> 00:48:45,670
if you've got a third-party mailer you
can

643
00:48:45,670 --> 00:48:48,900
CNAME the D can record so that

644
00:48:48,900 --> 00:48:53,130
if the need to retain it for whatever
reason targets of the compromise they

645
00:48:53,130 --> 00:48:53,790
can just delete it

646
00:48:53,790 --> 00:49:00,270
