1
00:00:01,689 --> 00:00:08,620
well think you can hear me

2
00:00:08,620 --> 00:00:11,469
yes her

3
00:00:11,469 --> 00:00:15,518
okay and so we're gonna talk on a Mac
give you a history lesson same honest

4
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:16,420
and open source

5
00:00:16,420 --> 00:00:19,590
hardware and the first are and %uh
snapper

6
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:23,130
and memoranda and ninety hackerspace and
here's a ser

7
00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:26,380
with Katharina and we're both cultures
and Oppenheimer summer

8
00:00:26,380 --> 00:00:31,340
for this year in September anti season
in mechanical engineering NYU Poly

9
00:00:31,340 --> 00:00:35,629
and I'm also a teacher and my ears
interactive telecommunications program

10
00:00:35,629 --> 00:00:39,019
and heading in the thirties these didn't
and I'm

11
00:00:39,020 --> 00:00:43,980
meanwhile talk to you live now open
source her anger me think this is going

12
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:47,040
day okay so the

13
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:50,600
basically I go here today is to talk a
little bit I'll flight what's the state

14
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:54,700
of open source hardware now to get the
big picture but we also found while

15
00:00:54,700 --> 00:00:55,780
preparing the stock

16
00:00:55,780 --> 00:00:59,910
fared um the night when the Stan what's
happening right now ha all these forces

17
00:00:59,910 --> 00:01:02,270
are converging to create this panorama
did

18
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:06,119
need to take a big deal to take a look
at the history how we got here so we

19
00:01:06,119 --> 00:01:06,829
gonna go back

20
00:01:06,829 --> 00:01:11,240
about ten years and tell you a lot like
the majors have the most important

21
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:11,990
projects

22
00:01:11,990 --> 00:01:15,850
in energy and we would like to to

23
00:01:15,850 --> 00:01:20,009
talk about where we go from now and we
believe that we have a few options

24
00:01:20,009 --> 00:01:23,869
and at that point will be left to turn
this into a discussion actually we would

25
00:01:23,869 --> 00:01:24,700
like to keep it

26
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:27,969
is dynamic informal as possible so any
moment

27
00:01:27,969 --> 00:01:31,270
wheels feel free to walk up to this
microphone and you know

28
00:01:31,270 --> 00:01:36,679
in tractors and give us your comments or
questions okay so um

29
00:01:36,679 --> 00:01:39,630
I mean much to imagine most people he
will be familiar with open source

30
00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:42,509
hardware fell 21 swine so basically

31
00:01:42,509 --> 00:01:45,659
up it after obviously on

32
00:01:45,659 --> 00:01:50,889
is a an adoption of the open source of
their principles and acted to hardware

33
00:01:50,889 --> 00:01:54,229
so basically it's a process and
development process in reach

34
00:01:54,229 --> 00:01:57,469
all the plans necessary to reproduce a
piece of hardware

35
00:01:57,469 --> 00:02:00,999
I made available are for anyone to study

36
00:02:00,999 --> 00:02:04,319
copy re really stupid and just basically

37
00:02:04,319 --> 00:02:07,499
resale into whatever they want with
those plans and hardware

38
00:02:07,499 --> 00:02:10,530
what this means is that I

39
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:13,810
excessively to the harbor plans
basically lowers the barrier to entry

40
00:02:13,810 --> 00:02:15,540
significantly so

41
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:19,100
we are seeing a lot more non

42
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:22,780
engineers and just basically and the
chest from all walks of life

43
00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:27,440
starting to actually create new hardware
or at least improve existing hardware

44
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:31,520
and so we gonna like a guy getting we
gonna talk a little bit of how this all

45
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:33,390
started like backing them

46
00:02:33,390 --> 00:02:36,910
late 1990s and China star person sir

47
00:02:36,910 --> 00:02:40,880
am so yeah and early nineteen nineties

48
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:44,280
and Mexicans are suffering daryl is
becoming really huge

49
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:49,120
and the next up was a program is gonna
turn to hardware because they

50
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:53,110
they figured if they had more control
over their computers and chips

51
00:02:53,110 --> 00:02:56,730
and a hundred they work with the great
better software and other open source

52
00:02:56,730 --> 00:02:57,899
software for that

53
00:02:57,900 --> 00:03:01,320
and because they come accustomed to kind
of sharing occurred

54
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:04,829
sharing d design files and the harbour

55
00:03:04,830 --> 00:03:07,850
files became kind of natural and it was
a

56
00:03:07,850 --> 00:03:11,230
a natural next step so it wasn't that

57
00:03:11,230 --> 00:03:15,110
open hardware started with his big fan
fair and ethnic festival it just kinda

58
00:03:15,110 --> 00:03:18,450
something that happened naturally and
this is what people did

59
00:03:18,450 --> 00:03:22,920
and wanna be earliest projects

60
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:26,640
and that we've been able to finance open
course which was

61
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:31,000
an a club in an effort to develop open
source IP cores

62
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,470
and it's one of the oldest and largest
open source communities that we know I'm

63
00:03:34,470 --> 00:03:38,740
another million to sing tragic and also
won a furious

64
00:03:38,740 --> 00:03:41,970
is spike fund which mean those among
certain

65
00:03:41,970 --> 00:03:45,540
most you who are here today that weapon
harville socially now

66
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:48,959
and so basically spike fun started

67
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:53,300
E Nathan Seattle's fans will my college
band from back in 2003

68
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:56,610
and it started the way most hecker stock
anything which is

69
00:03:56,610 --> 00:03:59,750
he couldn't find parts for his hind
where and

70
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:03,680
a he realized that he ordered him in
larger quantities than he could keep the

71
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:06,060
ones you need it and sell the rest to
his friends

72
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:09,910
so he started what he thought was gonna
be. not like a local business are some

73
00:04:09,910 --> 00:04:11,060
fights his friends

74
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:15,100
I it took off really quickly in really
well and for

75
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:19,690
recently spike fun and announced that
they had

76
00:04:19,690 --> 00:04:24,949
a to over $2 million in revenue for 2011
so it's a company that really really

77
00:04:24,949 --> 00:04:25,500
groom

78
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:29,029
are throughout the years is probably one
of to commercially speaking one of the

79
00:04:29,029 --> 00:04:29,639
biggest

80
00:04:29,639 --> 00:04:34,819
open source hardware companies another
one that is also

81
00:04:34,819 --> 00:04:38,620
really early and so far talked a little
bit about this

82
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:41,860
and so basically we're going like even
further back than he did

83
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:46,449
was repre- and so it Rep rappers
originally created by

84
00:04:46,449 --> 00:04:51,669
Adrian boyer who was a professor at
University of Bath in the UK

85
00:04:51,669 --> 00:04:56,299
and he actually launched a probe project
back in 2004

86
00:04:56,300 --> 00:05:01,009
which is arm a lot earlier than you know
we tend to think about

87
00:05:01,009 --> 00:05:04,539
insoles he wanted to create and machine

88
00:05:04,539 --> 00:05:08,120
dat I would allow people especially
people in regions

89
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:11,520
with not that many resources to create
anything they needed

90
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:15,299
in also to create other machine to make
my things basically

91
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:19,080
he wanted to give manufacturing power to
communities that were

92
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:24,330
otherwise on empowerment so EU also
realized two things action shemales with

93
00:05:24,330 --> 00:05:27,859
him a few years ago and he has agreed to
success if you might

94
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:31,520
so I asked him why open source this and
he said like first of all because it's a

95
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:33,299
very powerful technology

96
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:36,539
in it should be in the hands of just a
few but also because

97
00:05:36,539 --> 00:05:40,748
if I am Ino making a machine that are
self-replicating then it will be insane

98
00:05:40,749 --> 00:05:42,580
to make it closed source I'll be

99
00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:45,818
for the rest of my life and

100
00:05:45,819 --> 00:05:49,289
still basically he put out a call saying
like I wanna do this

101
00:05:49,289 --> 00:05:52,998
knows a few people in my lab doing this
who wants to join us and

102
00:05:52,999 --> 00:05:57,539
handful after developers around the
world some of them software developers

103
00:05:57,539 --> 00:06:04,539
began building the first personal 3d
printers in their garages

104
00:06:04,949 --> 00:06:08,389
and read about the same time are just
after that is wearing

105
00:06:08,389 --> 00:06:12,189
and make magazine started in 2005 this
is their first issue

106
00:06:12,189 --> 00:06:16,550
back cover and kinda modern day version
and pokémon mechanics electronics

107
00:06:16,550 --> 00:06:19,669
I'm sure months to hear

108
00:06:19,669 --> 00:06:23,839
have heard of it and in addition to
giving people the knowledge and

109
00:06:23,839 --> 00:06:27,529
encouragement to kinda trying new things
than half what they had in Crete

110
00:06:27,529 --> 00:06:31,400
and personal projects it created a real
thank the community for probably the

111
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:33,330
first time in these people are makers

112
00:06:33,330 --> 00:06:38,620
they weren't just and disparate a group
and people tinkering apartment in garage

113
00:06:38,620 --> 00:06:42,499
you are a maker of a sudden and actually
force is really powerful

114
00:06:42,499 --> 00:06:47,210
and indeed it is mostly through has been
doing Maker Faire

115
00:06:47,210 --> 00:06:51,210
it is mostly through Maker Faire
Panthers started now in 2006 with the

116
00:06:51,210 --> 00:06:52,039
first plan

117
00:06:52,039 --> 00:06:55,430
with 20,000 attendees and it now we get

118
00:06:55,430 --> 00:06:58,990
six-figure attendances at death in his
car maker barriers

119
00:06:58,990 --> 00:07:05,990
about foreign you all and and 100 Mini
Maker Faires all across the world now

120
00:07:07,619 --> 00:07:11,279
and it's not too bad energy now in 2005

121
00:07:11,279 --> 00:07:15,919
and eighty researchers and educators in
in a lame

122
00:07:15,919 --> 00:07:20,188
were sitting around at a pub called
Arduino and decided that they needed a

123
00:07:20,189 --> 00:07:22,860
better way to teach their art and design
students

124
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:26,499
electronics and it is really weren't
happy with any the options out there for

125
00:07:26,499 --> 00:07:28,249
microcontrollers and such

126
00:07:28,249 --> 00:07:31,779
so they put their own design together
and the open source the plan

127
00:07:31,779 --> 00:07:34,939
their university was not to fail at that
time slimline these

128
00:07:34,939 --> 00:07:38,279
plan to live on no matter what happens
and

129
00:07:38,279 --> 00:07:42,789
they creator Lena and has since then
it's become

130
00:07:42,789 --> 00:07:47,409
a building block for time that other
open hardware projects and because it's

131
00:07:47,409 --> 00:07:51,539
low-cost is the views open thirst
software and hardware

132
00:07:51,539 --> 00:07:55,469
accessibility it created a larger
community a larger following than any

133
00:07:55,469 --> 00:07:57,129
other project before

134
00:07:57,129 --> 00:08:02,729
at the basic stance and the other
mexicans or options

135
00:08:02,729 --> 00:08:05,849
peace now arm real-life it make a buck

136
00:08:05,849 --> 00:08:09,248
which was one of the project said
Tuesday and we know has a building block

137
00:08:09,249 --> 00:08:09,809
so

138
00:08:09,809 --> 00:08:14,289
arm for a while there on instill now
make a better man behind me knows

139
00:08:14,289 --> 00:08:19,369
ansel are far talked a lot about project
can we not gonna go deep into it I just

140
00:08:19,369 --> 00:08:21,610
really liked the way it began

141
00:08:21,610 --> 00:08:25,210
and so what happened was by the end of
the decade by D end of

142
00:08:25,210 --> 00:08:28,919
the 2000's the rep rep at it was very
much alive you know the numbers

143
00:08:28,919 --> 00:08:31,748
developers was growing it was all around
the world

144
00:08:31,749 --> 00:08:35,649
but you still very slow progress and
very few people Rex fully aware that

145
00:08:35,649 --> 00:08:39,409
there was an open source personal 3d
printer out there

146
00:08:39,409 --> 00:08:43,909
and the main reason for this I find and
other people found was that

147
00:08:43,909 --> 00:08:47,550
it was extremely hard to source the
right parts depending on where you wind

148
00:08:47,550 --> 00:08:50,030
the Welsh like you told achieve
eckenrode

149
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:54,130
but like where you gonna find the right
one you know good quality one

150
00:08:54,130 --> 00:08:57,850
and ISM a big major hurdle in one of the
biggest complains and

151
00:08:57,850 --> 00:09:01,520
issues people don't but was like how to
find the right parts and how to put em

152
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:02,110
together

153
00:09:02,110 --> 00:09:05,290
or even how to replace one point for
something that was like six you know

154
00:09:05,290 --> 00:09:09,949
available locally so that's when three
members of NYC resistor

155
00:09:09,950 --> 00:09:15,500
arm realized it was you know it was time
to come up with a simpler 3d printer

156
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:17,880
something people could assemble

157
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:21,040
on we don't actually spending months on
it

158
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:26,160
and they created their first the first
make a buck was the cupcake CNC and then

159
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:29,660
you know shortly after death realize
that if we turn that into a

160
00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:32,890
or the same time mister turnin into a
company then

161
00:09:32,890 --> 00:09:36,710
me know they could do what they love all
the time but also making kits available

162
00:09:36,710 --> 00:09:40,520
would help spread the technology faster
and better

163
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:44,530
I and of course I know imagine what it
will not he sees maker but right now

164
00:09:44,530 --> 00:09:48,140
they've sold thousands of printers &
Yandel two million dollar company right

165
00:09:48,140 --> 00:09:50,189
now

166
00:09:50,190 --> 00:09:53,720
still Ende in the

167
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:58,080
after massive like Orinda process with
the excitement around 3d printing

168
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:58,770
growing

169
00:09:58,770 --> 00:10:01,970
and you know make and what was one of
the company's those like crap that was

170
00:10:01,970 --> 00:10:05,720
also growing at the same time into a
feeding off each other

171
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:10,590
a we started seeing other projects like
unseemly areas appear so now we have a

172
00:10:10,590 --> 00:10:14,730
stain ok if I mention like a lot of 3d
printers amongst a Michael T may come

173
00:10:14,730 --> 00:10:15,380
soon xoxo

174
00:10:15,380 --> 00:10:18,760
also open source but also and

175
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:23,240
more open source digital fabrication
tools for example laser song which is an

176
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:24,150
open-source

177
00:10:24,150 --> 00:10:29,020
laser cutter and DIY a lil CNC which is
an open-source

178
00:10:29,020 --> 00:10:32,560
a CNC milling so a mean basically

179
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:35,900
re we saw a this landscape like

180
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:41,930
Grohl really fast and expand in several
directions

181
00:10:41,930 --> 00:10:46,130
to the nineteen noticed our time line
you kinda get this exponential curve

182
00:10:46,130 --> 00:10:50,040
apt word via reasons are towards now

183
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:53,170
and there's tons and companies that we
could talk forever about your fruit

184
00:10:53,170 --> 00:10:55,839
Local Motors that made through an open
source car plans

185
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:59,160
and DIY drones that makes basically
robotic

186
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:03,130
autonomous planes and helicopters
BeagleBoard bag labs

187
00:11:03,130 --> 00:11:06,520
dangerous prototypes evil mad scientist
lab scissors and

188
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:10,530
there and how to change as open source
between from software to hardware

189
00:11:10,530 --> 00:11:13,980
and good we receive studio to China

190
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:17,410
this is not just the US is a global
thing and there's more and more these

191
00:11:17,410 --> 00:11:19,329
companies popping up every day

192
00:11:19,330 --> 00:11:23,360
and some people are trying to keep track
of these companies for a while I have

193
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:27,320
almost stopped that because there's just
so many that are coming out every month

194
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:29,040
it's really exciting

195
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:34,040
and another exciting thing that leaves
the happened very recently

196
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:38,730
is the open source hardware is not Jess
starting to love it not just three

197
00:11:38,730 --> 00:11:39,880
printers anymore

198
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:45,570
is already knows it's and open source
heart rate sensors on that last there's

199
00:11:45,570 --> 00:11:47,430
a picture of a possum sir

200
00:11:47,430 --> 00:11:52,340
and that was kick-started by a buncha by
a few and are you ITT grads

201
00:11:52,340 --> 00:11:55,340
and in the middle is a bro cockroach

202
00:11:55,340 --> 00:11:58,350
there's a thigh neuroscience specialist

203
00:11:58,350 --> 00:12:02,080
runs back yard brains out hands great
grading attack our

204
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:05,670
and a basically can put this an open
hardware

205
00:12:05,670 --> 00:12:10,140
on a Roach and stearate by and tapping
at and health

206
00:12:10,140 --> 00:12:14,960
right or left and you can listen to you
the brain lands and things like that and

207
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:16,230
it is all open hardware

208
00:12:16,230 --> 00:12:20,010
a fatal attacks an on the rate we have
all kinds the

209
00:12:20,010 --> 00:12:23,689
new developments in the fashion
technology industries where we have a

210
00:12:23,690 --> 00:12:25,430
project called how to get what you want

211
00:12:25,430 --> 00:12:29,050
Abacoa cont you can see from the center
is here

212
00:12:29,050 --> 00:12:32,500
their square sensors pressure sensors
accelerometers

213
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:36,720
ass tits two potentiometers and tilt
sensors me

214
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:39,840
just from conductive fabric and thread
so there's that

215
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:43,120
many different directions as he can

216
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:46,400
and so now

217
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:49,920
we get to hackerspace actually have to
you know go back a little bird

218
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:53,760
and how you know hackerspace inspired
come into all this

219
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:57,730
so I mean the story of the hackerspace
is most others know here in the US

220
00:12:57,730 --> 00:13:00,670
actually start in 2006 with Nick fire

221
00:13:00,670 --> 00:13:04,950
arm he actually went tools see in sea
bass in Berlin that year

222
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:09,970
in was amazed by what he saw their so he
filed touring package faces today US

223
00:13:09,970 --> 00:13:13,640
in the next year he organized hecker
trip

224
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:16,699
call hackers on a plane which is you
know a bunch of people from here that

225
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:19,630
flew over two million to check out
hackerspace since

226
00:13:19,630 --> 00:13:23,710
and so within just a few weeks of
returning from that trip

227
00:13:23,710 --> 00:13:27,290
I the people the people on those style
under on it

228
00:13:27,290 --> 00:13:32,069
created NYC resistor don't remember us
nice beach in San Francisco hectoring

229
00:13:32,070 --> 00:13:35,930
Philadelphia in Haiti seen Washington DC

230
00:13:35,930 --> 00:13:42,030
and then something soon like really an
expected in magical happened which is

231
00:13:42,030 --> 00:13:45,069
I hadn't heard you say it inspire its by

232
00:13:45,070 --> 00:13:48,260
most is new American hackerspace is and

233
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:52,410
German hackers bases with some of which
were like a decade or two old

234
00:13:52,410 --> 00:13:56,540
the movement sided spreading like
wildfire both in the US and Europe

235
00:13:56,540 --> 00:13:59,740
so within just a few years if that and

236
00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:03,970
the number grew so much that by D end of
last year there were over 500

237
00:14:03,970 --> 00:14:08,220
a hackerspace is like throughout the
world so this is something that we found

238
00:14:08,220 --> 00:14:10,150
like it's unprecedented

239
00:14:10,150 --> 00:14:14,600
we try to look at like the locations but
it's like Tokyo Shanghai Hong Kong

240
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:20,510
Beijing angle or say gone Moscow Sydney
when a site is Lagos New Delhi Nepal

241
00:14:20,510 --> 00:14:25,030
Singapore and just like really really
huge number of locations so

242
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:29,240
missus fossil along with the growth and
expansion of open source hardware this

243
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:29,690
is like

244
00:14:29,690 --> 00:14:35,870
the human side event that is extremely
exciting to us

245
00:14:35,870 --> 00:14:41,990
next time an and then there and early
2010 there is kind of a lot of momentum

246
00:14:41,990 --> 00:14:42,240
in

247
00:14:42,230 --> 00:14:45,860
open hardware community and they're
starting to be some

248
00:14:45,860 --> 00:14:49,190
some cries for kinda formalizing a
little bit an

249
00:14:49,190 --> 00:14:49,649
and

250
00:14:49,649 --> 00:14:52,949
in and trying to join together and see
what is open hardware like

251
00:14:52,949 --> 00:14:56,930
can be defined it can we make are the
rules should we have a stamping Ashley

252
00:14:56,930 --> 00:14:57,889
have it locally

253
00:14:57,889 --> 00:15:01,089
are kinda stuff like that what makes
open hardware open

254
00:15:01,089 --> 00:15:06,600
and and at the time I have the deer was
a fellow at IBM

255
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:09,699
and also becoming a Creative Commons
fell

256
00:15:09,699 --> 00:15:13,779
and she had been talking to John Eubanks
a Creative Commons quite a bit about how

257
00:15:13,779 --> 00:15:15,720
to get one of her project had little
bits

258
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:19,429
which was then a project and now I most
recently a company

259
00:15:19,429 --> 00:15:23,209
and off the ground and what kinda
protection she needed were how to

260
00:15:23,209 --> 00:15:24,600
protect the openness

261
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:28,579
at this hardware because there wasn't
really a lot of President none of these

262
00:15:28,579 --> 00:15:32,619
open Harbor companies that ever been to
to court had to defend it so it's very

263
00:15:32,619 --> 00:15:33,819
very new space

264
00:15:33,819 --> 00:15:37,110
so as she orchestrated a meeting at
about

265
00:15:37,110 --> 00:15:41,929
anarchy police here miss picture 20 and
25 people are so at IBM

266
00:15:41,929 --> 00:15:46,379
there was a opening hardware workshop
where and John Wilbanks

267
00:15:46,379 --> 00:15:50,529
and ass a thing going in have legal
counsel active Commons

268
00:15:50,529 --> 00:15:54,179
kinda talk to everybody Inc even run
down and why I P is

269
00:15:54,179 --> 00:15:59,899
what the protections are and advise
attorneys to determine the Paxos norms

270
00:15:59,899 --> 00:16:00,480
and data

271
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:03,579
opting for a long and painful kinda
legal

272
00:16:03,579 --> 00:16:06,769
as recourse so that day

273
00:16:06,769 --> 00:16:10,290
there is workshops and a lot of talk
about what to do

274
00:16:10,290 --> 00:16:13,649
to legal staff what to do to define open
hardware

275
00:16:13,649 --> 00:16:17,660
and we argued and urs community building
and I

276
00:16:17,660 --> 00:16:21,209
and one thing the commander early

277
00:16:21,209 --> 00:16:24,480
early on was that open-heart
redefinition

278
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:28,139
and at that point I was that your 0.1
definition

279
00:16:28,139 --> 00:16:31,879
it was basically working on a that day
and then a lot of emails back and forth

280
00:16:31,879 --> 00:16:33,949
between the participants and that day

281
00:16:33,949 --> 00:16:37,009
am so you can find the current
definition which is then

282
00:16:37,009 --> 00:16:40,470
version 1.0 actually him to find .org

283
00:16:40,470 --> 00:16:44,970
and that's sad that was started by

284
00:16:44,970 --> 00:16:49,309
I Hans am that people at this

285
00:16:49,309 --> 00:16:55,368
opening hardware works happen so around
the same time also in early 2010 only

286
00:16:55,369 --> 00:16:56,850
she keep who was dan

287
00:16:56,850 --> 00:17:01,160
and director of R&D editor michael has
an open source hardware company

288
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:05,619
started thinking that it was time for
together the community for in a more

289
00:17:05,620 --> 00:17:07,279
in-depth discussion because

290
00:17:07,279 --> 00:17:10,388
you again up until then I was like all
these companies and projects like

291
00:17:10,389 --> 00:17:11,559
growing people would

292
00:17:11,559 --> 00:17:14,500
you know sometimes needed conferences
but there wasn't anything organized

293
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:16,289
about it so

294
00:17:16,289 --> 00:17:20,429
she began organizing the first open
hardware summit which happen in

295
00:17:20,429 --> 00:17:22,179
September 2010

296
00:17:22,179 --> 00:17:25,319
can't rule almost four hundred people

297
00:17:25,319 --> 00:17:29,330
so to sum it became an annual event we
are checking it dis year

298
00:17:29,330 --> 00:17:32,490
and it's going you know it's trying an
increasing number of people

299
00:17:32,490 --> 00:17:35,630
and also interestingly enough the

300
00:17:35,630 --> 00:17:40,130
notion of hardware is expanding so we
started with mostly electronics then

301
00:17:40,130 --> 00:17:43,139
from there we moved to 3d printing and
product design

302
00:17:43,139 --> 00:17:46,309
in nineteen includes neuroscience and
all kindsa

303
00:17:46,309 --> 00:17:51,960
really weirds stuff so that then this
year's is gonna be in September as well

304
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:55,309
so then

305
00:17:55,309 --> 00:17:58,570
and the next archive after creating this

306
00:17:58,570 --> 00:18:01,990
overheard were some at an only Shahid

307
00:18:01,990 --> 00:18:05,350
take the home and is now the president
in the open source hardware association

308
00:18:05,350 --> 00:18:07,168
in this is a corporatist

309
00:18:07,169 --> 00:18:11,520
weeks ago really as I think we're
creating the process of becoming a

310
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:12,450
non-profit

311
00:18:12,450 --> 00:18:16,860
and for education and the community to
kind of spread the open hardware

312
00:18:16,860 --> 00:18:20,450
IQ tests and try to see try to
disseminate

313
00:18:20,450 --> 00:18:24,429
best practices and things like that and
when the reasons is because

314
00:18:24,429 --> 00:18:28,230
you know there's a lot of companies in
over 100 cities now I have a lot of

315
00:18:28,230 --> 00:18:28,940
projects

316
00:18:28,940 --> 00:18:33,460
there is it it wasn't a good idea to
have the movement led by as someone at a

317
00:18:33,460 --> 00:18:37,049
commercial interest in it so bringing
those people are together under kinda

318
00:18:37,049 --> 00:18:37,649
umbrella

319
00:18:37,649 --> 00:18:41,059
have a non-profit is that is the way
that

320
00:18:41,059 --> 00:18:44,750
lisa ann add people on the board had
decided to move forward with kinda

321
00:18:44,750 --> 00:18:46,049
keeping a keen to gather

322
00:18:46,049 --> 00:18:50,580
and Madison eating all that I work and
then I Karina put together an

323
00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:51,529
open-source

324
00:18:51,529 --> 00:18:54,580
hardware it has made Thursday and

325
00:18:54,580 --> 00:18:58,270
and went to the gas from ethanol lapses
in the process serve going to this day

326
00:18:58,270 --> 00:18:58,780
today

327
00:18:58,780 --> 00:19:01,820
in one reasoning problem was that she
expected

328
00:19:01,820 --> 00:19:06,230
a couple hundred responders to the
survey can anyone here take them however

329
00:19:06,230 --> 00:19:06,850
survey

330
00:19:06,850 --> 00:19:11,190
great and got over two thousand
responses

331
00:19:11,190 --> 00:19:15,350
to the survey from seventy countries and
she's got a lot of data to go through a

332
00:19:15,350 --> 00:19:15,950
thorough

333
00:19:15,950 --> 00:19:18,450
and this is one of the air

334
00:19:18,450 --> 00:19:22,250
the grass on that the big orange
marcia's the original have used opens at

335
00:19:22,250 --> 00:19:23,270
Harbor and the graph

336
00:19:23,270 --> 00:19:26,710
and we have data everything from
demographics to

337
00:19:26,710 --> 00:19:30,910
I whether these heat or I work at
companies are doing it on your own time

338
00:19:30,910 --> 00:19:33,970
and I will be getting handouts her

339
00:19:33,970 --> 00:19:36,970
through Asia an 10 yeah

340
00:19:36,970 --> 00:19:41,170
and so then really

341
00:19:41,170 --> 00:19:44,500
reading in 2005 is going to become the
year

342
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:48,770
and make a culture open source and open
source hardware and all the things kinda

343
00:19:48,770 --> 00:19:49,420
overlapping

344
00:19:49,420 --> 00:19:52,900
you probably understand open source
hardware hackers faces in digital

345
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:53,800
fabricators

346
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:57,100
and it's going to be really exciting to
see how are those kind of plays out

347
00:19:57,100 --> 00:20:01,100
and we now only have

348
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:04,630
about to open source hardware companies
and projects but now we're certainly

349
00:20:04,630 --> 00:20:05,310
have all

350
00:20:05,310 --> 00:20:09,129
that open source hardware tools we need
to make things between these are soaring

351
00:20:09,130 --> 00:20:13,840
3-pointers in DIY CNC is and hackers
bases provide

352
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:17,780
under the human capital and the physical
space for a lot of people that want to

353
00:20:17,780 --> 00:20:19,440
practice these things to come together

354
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:22,620
inquiry and projects and companies and
kick off is kinda

355
00:20:22,620 --> 00:20:27,500
and work of it's a BCP

356
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:31,360
so basically what we have right now is
dislike really amazing combination of

357
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:32,670
human capital

358
00:20:32,670 --> 00:20:35,890
physical infrastructure a

359
00:20:35,890 --> 00:20:39,450
social relationships and tools so

360
00:20:39,450 --> 00:20:43,480
the scene and I you know we we talk a
lot about the things I wish I could

361
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:45,240
think about them and

362
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:48,260
we also tried to step back and look at
the big picture because

363
00:20:48,260 --> 00:20:51,629
you know people in our community
including ourselves sometimes we find

364
00:20:51,630 --> 00:20:55,510
ourselves like so driven to make things
to create things to know

365
00:20:55,510 --> 00:20:59,300
create businesses & Grill businesses to
create hardware and make it better

366
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:03,230
dead we don't always teach opportunity
to take a step back and really think

367
00:21:03,230 --> 00:21:05,020
about what this all means when

368
00:21:05,020 --> 00:21:09,690
you know as a whole so then one of the
things things recycle case we have this

369
00:21:09,690 --> 00:21:11,420
really amazing situation

370
00:21:11,420 --> 00:21:15,090
it feels unprecedented to us in our
lifetime and

371
00:21:15,090 --> 00:21:18,929
it feels like something completely new
and revolutionary but has it happened

372
00:21:18,930 --> 00:21:19,650
before

373
00:21:19,650 --> 00:21:24,590
so you know we hardware hacker so we
look into the hard way he swung

374
00:21:24,590 --> 00:21:28,209
and we did find it very interesting
parallel like a mean other people have

375
00:21:28,210 --> 00:21:29,710
pointed out this as well

376
00:21:29,710 --> 00:21:33,490
is that they're really striking
resemblances between what's happening

377
00:21:33,490 --> 00:21:34,250
right now

378
00:21:34,250 --> 00:21:37,110
and the development of the for the
personal computer in the mid of the

379
00:21:37,110 --> 00:21:38,400
1970s

380
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:42,380
and soul I'm gonna visit really the best
way very quickly because we think

381
00:21:42,380 --> 00:21:44,130
there's a lesson to be drawn from

382
00:21:44,130 --> 00:21:48,900
you know looking at history and how
things turned out so in your early 1970s

383
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:53,210
computers were still huge mainframes at
only universities and companies could

384
00:21:53,210 --> 00:21:53,870
afford

385
00:21:53,870 --> 00:21:58,550
in even leading DCC tutions like only a
very small group of people could

386
00:21:58,550 --> 00:22:00,379
actually access to computers

387
00:22:00,380 --> 00:22:03,520
you called the priesthood I so of course

388
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:07,480
te Chris wanted to get their hands on
computers such as how it goes

389
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:11,190
and for the mall some of them could but
a lot of them couldn't

390
00:22:11,190 --> 00:22:14,350
still do a lot of people at a time

391
00:22:14,350 --> 00:22:18,260
are thinking how they could make this
possible and the first half a newly

392
00:22:18,260 --> 00:22:19,190
found for them

393
00:22:19,190 --> 00:22:23,930
time-sharing system switches by creating
terminals for single mainframe in

394
00:22:23,930 --> 00:22:26,240
placing them in public places they would
give

395
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:31,610
you note the man of the street exe still
she incredibly expensive computer in

396
00:22:31,610 --> 00:22:35,860
and then of course if you only a handful
very few dreamed of

397
00:22:35,860 --> 00:22:39,580
even leverage even like dreamed of
having this sorry thinking about

398
00:22:39,580 --> 00:22:41,490
personal computers decided you know

399
00:22:41,490 --> 00:22:45,230
putting together some electronics in
their garages in dreaming up a day when

400
00:22:45,230 --> 00:22:46,970
they actually do have their own

401
00:22:46,970 --> 00:22:53,010
so windy all-star came out in 1976 if
I'm not mistaken

402
00:22:53,010 --> 00:22:57,270
nope this community was just incredibly
excited and couldn't believe dat

403
00:22:57,270 --> 00:23:01,770
what they were dreaming about this
finally there and created us a handful

404
00:23:01,770 --> 00:23:02,889
have demeaned

405
00:23:02,890 --> 00:23:06,140
West Coast created the Homeric the
famous Humber Computer Club

406
00:23:06,140 --> 00:23:10,680
so the Homebrew Computer Club just like
hackerspace is became dislike

407
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:14,040
incubator for the personal computer
industry

408
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:17,940
you know %uh Steve Wozniak was dearly
pheasant thousand style I call these

409
00:23:17,940 --> 00:23:19,800
really creative amazing people

410
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:23,850
and exchanging information about helped
make computer still bringing their board

411
00:23:23,850 --> 00:23:24,850
still giving out

412
00:23:24,850 --> 00:23:28,090
you know they're exchanging parts that
were hard to find

413
00:23:28,090 --> 00:23:33,679
basically the richest working together
too good to get computers in your own

414
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:35,820
home so they could have each have their
own

415
00:23:35,820 --> 00:23:39,189
but of course they will also like there
was also a very important business

416
00:23:39,190 --> 00:23:40,470
opportunity in dis

417
00:23:40,470 --> 00:23:43,710
and many of them study creating
companies around these in a

418
00:23:43,710 --> 00:23:46,790
hot on this high but that they were
developing

419
00:23:46,790 --> 00:23:51,879
still things happen really really fast
in leading two years

420
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:54,910
are the personal computer industry began

421
00:23:54,910 --> 00:23:59,570
went from non-existent to a a
billion-dollar industry

422
00:23:59,570 --> 00:24:06,210
many of these people were went from
being hackers to becoming CEO's

423
00:24:06,210 --> 00:24:10,330
and arm a lot of the information sharing
stopped

424
00:24:10,330 --> 00:24:13,960
so we are looking here also at

425
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:19,350
a a time when and plans were shared
freely there was collaboration there

426
00:24:19,350 --> 00:24:22,450
were something somewhat equivalent to a
hackerspace

427
00:24:22,450 --> 00:24:26,460
there was a new technology that was
gonna change people's lives are so sweet

428
00:24:26,460 --> 00:24:28,100
you know 3d printing my

429
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:32,390
half sweetie like really really striking
resemblances here

430
00:24:32,390 --> 00:24:36,000
would we also look back and see how

431
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:39,000
this really promising collaboration and

432
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:42,170
you know creative environment also ended
up

433
00:24:42,170 --> 00:24:46,270
within two years only turn into an
industry leaders like first the

434
00:24:46,270 --> 00:24:47,480
competitive

435
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:51,700
highly patented everything is a trade
secret

436
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:54,880
well mean you guys know where ha the
computer industry works

437
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:59,310
so do in a hut

438
00:24:59,310 --> 00:25:02,610
am do you never read choose your own
adventure books

439
00:25:02,610 --> 00:25:06,820
when you're a little okay so here's
where we think there's a really really

440
00:25:06,820 --> 00:25:07,939
good opportunity for us

441
00:25:07,940 --> 00:25:11,130
here this user an adventure because

442
00:25:11,130 --> 00:25:14,560
on on the flip side of that cautionary
tale is

443
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:18,590
know this is the early picture and then
my fear is a hackerspace

444
00:25:18,590 --> 00:25:22,480
is opens up officers harbors author me
to let all hold hands and make make

445
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:24,640
things open in sharing and all others
work

446
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:28,820
and over 200 does have a real
opportunity to star

447
00:25:28,820 --> 00:25:33,830
real-world problems from be on the print
yours hurts to making your own

448
00:25:33,830 --> 00:25:37,460
announced during your own cockroaches in
at things like that that we can

449
00:25:37,460 --> 00:25:43,300
week the more we understand about
technology can educate non engineers and

450
00:25:43,300 --> 00:25:46,880
anyone money what a place that wants to
make their own stuff the more

451
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:50,020
that technology literacy we have as a
community and as a world in

452
00:25:50,020 --> 00:25:53,040
that we can make things better with tho

453
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:56,870
and on that way back to you ask you are
tagged

454
00:25:56,870 --> 00:26:00,660
kinda choose your own adventure with us
and discuss or ask questions about

455
00:26:00,660 --> 00:26:07,660
which we think this is gonna end up

456
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:13,520
key to can you look into the mic fire

457
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:19,158
%uh thinking

458
00:26:19,159 --> 00:26:22,679
just so everyone can hear you I there

459
00:26:22,679 --> 00:26:25,990
right on I'm pretty new to

460
00:26:25,990 --> 00:26:30,840
the idea of open source hardware and
I've gotten a whole bunches

461
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:34,210
great pointy ears designs that

462
00:26:34,210 --> 00:26:38,000
fairly well and bright lights but the
man to the

463
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:42,750
the community-wide to get their
importance it to make these incessant

464
00:26:42,750 --> 00:26:47,679
be even better designs where do I begin
arm

465
00:26:47,679 --> 00:26:52,909
the Internet yeah yes so i mean

466
00:26:52,909 --> 00:26:57,570
the the bed like the first thing you
wanna do is Priya plans online soon

467
00:26:57,570 --> 00:26:59,529
actually legitimately open source

468
00:26:59,529 --> 00:27:03,389
and even if the incomplete you can just
see their incomplete in then

469
00:27:03,389 --> 00:27:06,429
um its easy to find the hops where

470
00:27:06,429 --> 00:27:09,809
open source hardware developers gather
like looks at like again the open

471
00:27:09,809 --> 00:27:13,100
hardware some is the one physical
instance where people like actually see

472
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:14,480
each other face to face

473
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:17,600
but they and their all like this other
places or

474
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:20,669
you know even just for the moment
putting them up on your blog

475
00:27:20,669 --> 00:27:24,460
treating them in using a hash tag open
source hardware will go a long way

476
00:27:24,460 --> 00:27:28,899
a blog is probably a good place yes to
exactly there isn't like you know

477
00:27:28,899 --> 00:27:32,019
we are grassroots community life you
know I

478
00:27:32,019 --> 00:27:38,879
okay pregnant think you'd like be

479
00:27:38,879 --> 00:27:43,190
howdy so I didn't think anything covers

480
00:27:43,190 --> 00:27:46,190
them uploading an open-source visible
finish

481
00:27:46,190 --> 00:27:51,009
thinker a design that's pretty complete
but I found that a lot of

482
00:27:51,009 --> 00:27:55,590
developing the designs is about figuring
out design techniques

483
00:27:55,590 --> 00:28:00,049
no this laser fastening works really
well this where this is how you live

484
00:28:00,049 --> 00:28:03,149
I would have a nice end to it is there a
place

485
00:28:03,149 --> 00:28:08,070
or hash tag or something to start
finding we're compiling

486
00:28:08,070 --> 00:28:11,779
uploading it by a myself solutions
design problems

487
00:28:11,779 --> 00:28:16,490
that's a really good question and as a
and mechanical engineer by training

488
00:28:16,490 --> 00:28:18,429
we've had never been looking for that

489
00:28:18,429 --> 00:28:21,460
after class talk years now and

490
00:28:21,460 --> 00:28:24,759
I am forgiven new Friday called Alka
mattered outward

491
00:28:24,759 --> 00:28:28,960
you know we're in super early out that
bad wanna things we're trying to do is

492
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:30,590
capture this kind and tribal

493
00:28:30,590 --> 00:28:33,669
procedural knowledge at how to make
things

494
00:28:33,669 --> 00:28:36,980
and not just how to make one part like
is there but putting stuff together and

495
00:28:36,980 --> 00:28:37,470
that's

496
00:28:37,470 --> 00:28:40,690
and big learning curve unheard of for a
lot and

497
00:28:40,690 --> 00:28:44,799
beginners so I'm vers I know have a
great a reference for you rather than

498
00:28:44,799 --> 00:28:45,799
going after

499
00:28:45,799 --> 00:28:49,340
other projects may be similar if you're
using now dead

500
00:28:49,340 --> 00:28:53,279
teeth shaped things to make a box with
their the team that will be in a major

501
00:28:53,279 --> 00:28:54,870
about that their laser cut piece

502
00:28:54,870 --> 00:28:57,830
pieces together you can look at their
plans and Macau other projects to do

503
00:28:57,830 --> 00:28:58,299
that

504
00:28:58,299 --> 00:29:02,210
and you can have to beg borrow and steal
from different cancer cystic kinda

505
00:29:02,210 --> 00:29:03,450
learners techniques

506
00:29:03,450 --> 00:29:06,860
that hopefully give any ideas for a
better solution for us now

507
00:29:06,860 --> 00:29:13,860
and I haven't stopped the later okay do
you have any advice for someone who has

508
00:29:16,559 --> 00:29:20,720
come up with something that seems
original or maybe in a technical way

509
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:24,010
abias and then receives letters

510
00:29:24,010 --> 00:29:27,110
from lawyers representing a patent troll

511
00:29:27,110 --> 00:29:31,350
and yeah

512
00:29:31,350 --> 00:29:36,750
a lil I mean that is something that we
need to deal with in this community it's

513
00:29:36,750 --> 00:29:38,760
it's it's really really complex

514
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:42,840
as so far the community's a stance has
been

515
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:44,400
to try and

516
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:49,710
and just stay out of quartz and you know
any kind of on

517
00:29:49,710 --> 00:29:53,130
legal battles as far as possible

518
00:29:53,130 --> 00:29:57,240
so I would say but in your case if you
actually receive those letters

519
00:29:57,240 --> 00:30:00,770
ideally you should compact and and

520
00:30:00,770 --> 00:30:04,290
attorneys are specializing that like for
for example I when after

521
00:30:04,290 --> 00:30:07,389
examples I'll to Jess's and Software
Freedom

522
00:30:07,390 --> 00:30:12,760
not Couric and they do so open source
Connor

523
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:15,879
the offer open source a legal advice and
actually

524
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:19,280
her dear also on I'm so you

525
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:23,680
the also a harsh recycled the open
source hardware associations attorneys

526
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:29,350
we are trying to creator legal FAQ for
the sites we can better support

527
00:30:29,350 --> 00:30:32,390
people who were in that situation so
hopefully we'll

528
00:30:32,390 --> 00:30:36,240
try and come up with as solutions but
one thing is really important to us if

529
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:37,400
you could get worse is like

530
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:41,190
send us your legal questions because
that's the one thing

531
00:30:41,190 --> 00:30:44,550
we can't do anything about like if we
know exactly what questions you have we

532
00:30:44,550 --> 00:30:46,020
can run them selector news

533
00:30:46,020 --> 00:30:49,129
and try and create like more or less
standardized answers

534
00:30:49,130 --> 00:30:52,280
by at least be able to point you in the
right direction

535
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:56,460
kinda the the concert %uh the big

536
00:30:56,460 --> 00:30:59,550
RMS purses Lansing NC show up in
hardware

537
00:30:59,550 --> 00:31:03,180
is the non-commercial clauses in leases
is

538
00:31:03,180 --> 00:31:06,460
there's a unlike software hardware is a
fundamentally different

539
00:31:06,460 --> 00:31:10,690
monster when you start talking about the
fact that want someone in China

540
00:31:10,690 --> 00:31:14,650
secure source files and can manufacture
them for 20 percent

541
00:31:14,650 --> 00:31:18,870
your cost on you do kinda get cut out a
bit and so

542
00:31:18,870 --> 00:31:22,650
the fact that a lot of the open hardware
guys are doing the same

543
00:31:22,650 --> 00:31:27,340
religious a everything must be open and
free where a lot of us really do you

544
00:31:27,340 --> 00:31:28,540
kinda wanna say

545
00:31:28,540 --> 00:31:33,149
this is open you can see my plans but if
you want to manufacture million of them

546
00:31:33,150 --> 00:31:35,630
I kinda do want singer licensing on that

547
00:31:35,630 --> 00:31:39,300
that's something I kinda wanna here
people talking about more honest

548
00:31:39,300 --> 00:31:44,050
kinda citing kinda white what we call it
went open hardware but

549
00:31:44,050 --> 00:31:48,720
their isn't this completes total
religious freedom to it

550
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:52,890
I'm right now and that

551
00:31:52,890 --> 00:31:56,040
open source hardware definition there is
an end to see

552
00:31:56,040 --> 00:32:00,300
you can't and and he's not part of it
you can't cut people out and

553
00:32:00,300 --> 00:32:01,510
commercializing your

554
00:32:01,510 --> 00:32:05,990
officers her great thing however also in
the closet says just because you

555
00:32:05,990 --> 00:32:10,030
want to come people and commercializing
thing does not mean that you shouldn't

556
00:32:10,030 --> 00:32:10,490
do it

557
00:32:10,490 --> 00:32:13,980
he just aren't supposed to stamp it with
a little the year some all you know any

558
00:32:13,980 --> 00:32:15,010
kind of sharing

559
00:32:15,010 --> 00:32:18,320
at any level is a is a great thing if
you wanna share it

560
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:22,210
but not leave a profit from it not in
thats that here and choice for sure

561
00:32:22,210 --> 00:32:25,760
it's definitely been a unplanned a lotta

562
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:29,490
arguments or at least discussion in in
the community

563
00:32:29,490 --> 00:32:33,200
cell we don't have all this worked out
yet there may be

564
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:37,490
maybe there's two different you know
gear stamps one for and nancy has in

565
00:32:37,490 --> 00:32:39,920
mind for not or maybe there's different
ways to

566
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:44,250
to work through that bad it's not really
a sauce problem other than what's

567
00:32:44,250 --> 00:32:48,310
other than that no hundreds of people
have agreed on this definition right now

568
00:32:48,310 --> 00:32:53,929
so I also like a I think there'd so far
so from so far we are going on got

569
00:32:53,930 --> 00:32:57,180
instinct and expensive people who'd been
doing this for a few years as a

570
00:32:57,180 --> 00:32:58,350
commercial venture

571
00:32:58,350 --> 00:33:02,150
and what they found was like its first
lead to the dude use non commercial

572
00:33:02,150 --> 00:33:04,510
licenses and and they realize it does
matter

573
00:33:04,510 --> 00:33:08,480
because ike everything is potentially
clonal

574
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:12,920
like Soul your copyright or your happen
so whatever it is the Apply

575
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:16,850
in your country but there's no saying
what happens in other countries have no

576
00:33:16,850 --> 00:33:17,980
control over that

577
00:33:17,980 --> 00:33:22,680
so you know everything can be ripped off
in any moment so they have a patent on

578
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:25,480
not so that's what are the lessons we
all learned very quickly

579
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:30,840
and younger one is that the

580
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:34,750
most people even if you if you had he
can afford to file a patent see you can

581
00:33:34,750 --> 00:33:36,370
which is extremely expensive

582
00:33:36,370 --> 00:33:40,740
you have to ask yourself can you for to
defend it right

583
00:33:40,740 --> 00:33:44,880
and so at one point what happens like
most businesses who started off as like

584
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:46,700
okay here my plans you can do

585
00:33:46,700 --> 00:33:51,110
make your own but you can sell it
immediately quickly switch to commercial

586
00:33:51,110 --> 00:33:54,410
licenses because I realized there was
really no point in preventing people

587
00:33:54,410 --> 00:33:55,080
from

588
00:33:55,080 --> 00:34:02,080
copying it for commercial purposes he
can barely see her whole yeahh the

589
00:34:02,630 --> 00:34:03,270
scariest

590
00:34:03,270 --> 00:34:07,850
at for any comments rounding down things
like art we know that claim to be I

591
00:34:07,850 --> 00:34:11,580
open source hardware but that
microcontroller itself is closed

592
00:34:11,580 --> 00:34:15,460
sites and open platform with a close
brain

593
00:34:15,460 --> 00:34:19,500
thanks and that's a really interesting
problem that

594
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:24,190
was brought on last year at summit it
there is someone needed and

595
00:34:24,190 --> 00:34:29,110
presentation last year the Panthers
harbors tire on and open source I see is

596
00:34:29,110 --> 00:34:32,649
and that's kinda the next frontier is
it's so complicated and expensive to

597
00:34:32,649 --> 00:34:33,889
create

598
00:34:33,889 --> 00:34:36,960
I feel like that block that are open

599
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:41,040
and affordable forward to make an open
hardware controller like tired we now

600
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:45,418
that no one has really done it yet and
that lasted a few black trying

601
00:34:45,418 --> 00:34:50,080
so if you had expertise or and methods
are things like that to bring up then

602
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:54,580
that's great you're not only one that
want that pressure

603
00:34:54,580 --> 00:34:58,029
their I just 10 kinda fell upon argue

604
00:34:58,030 --> 00:35:01,170
concept because the other way is going
to people or

605
00:35:01,170 --> 00:35:04,570
able to make in building use those
particular close chips

606
00:35:04,570 --> 00:35:09,020
and so we're saying the sea are going to
drive towards like lots of them

607
00:35:09,020 --> 00:35:12,610
and so this is an interesting example
people aren't necessary copying those

608
00:35:12,610 --> 00:35:13,950
boards and then selling

609
00:35:13,950 --> 00:35:17,930
because that has happened to people not
have a way of developing the board and

610
00:35:17,930 --> 00:35:18,460
say

611
00:35:18,460 --> 00:35:24,340
is an Arduino derived port but now you
have argued right words are like pic32

612
00:35:24,340 --> 00:35:28,490
or on the ARM Cortex so we actually is
about the sea

613
00:35:28,490 --> 00:35:31,750
many different kinds and boards that are
Arduino compatible

614
00:35:31,750 --> 00:35:34,990
least in terms of the API so

615
00:35:34,990 --> 00:35:38,760
we have a thing now where it's not just
be like a cloner

616
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:42,550
something we have to repair nations and
multiples I think it's like a living

617
00:35:42,550 --> 00:35:43,910
example %uh

618
00:35:43,910 --> 00:35:48,259
you know this diversity suddenly showing
up and how people respond and I think

619
00:35:48,260 --> 00:35:51,350
I guess Arduino decided to go a
trademark route

620
00:35:51,350 --> 00:35:55,839
yeah so you I'm even wondered about
others at an option for other people

621
00:35:55,840 --> 00:36:00,190
parallels or much her yes you owe me of
course you're absolutely right we

622
00:36:00,190 --> 00:36:01,940
actually fail to mention what's

623
00:36:01,940 --> 00:36:05,500
the one of the biggest advantages will
open source hardware is that

624
00:36:05,500 --> 00:36:09,300
most people would not clone your work
they will make a derivative

625
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:13,290
or do will make a combat hardware is
compatible with it and that's the case

626
00:36:13,290 --> 00:36:15,980
with idly nights a poster child for this

627
00:36:15,980 --> 00:36:19,310
and assess their Dr believe hundreds of

628
00:36:19,310 --> 00:36:22,620
I've been no derivatives meaning boards
that are not

629
00:36:22,620 --> 00:36:26,589
an exec and venal but they just have a
different functional on one has like

630
00:36:26,590 --> 00:36:29,720
Ethernet on more than the other one is
just meet what are your plans for

631
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:30,780
something

632
00:36:30,780 --> 00:36:35,280
and there are also hundreds over shields
flatly no meaning

633
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:39,580
the boards and extend the I'd be no a
capabilities

634
00:36:39,580 --> 00:36:43,830
so that's in that input I that increases
the value of the and we know itself

635
00:36:43,830 --> 00:36:46,750
because the more hardcore you can
interface said we had

636
00:36:46,750 --> 00:36:50,750
the more valuable the board itself this
isn't a major major events have open

637
00:36:50,750 --> 00:36:52,410
source hardware

638
00:36:52,410 --> 00:36:55,899
so in two games are and

639
00:36:55,900 --> 00:37:02,220
your question about trademarks so
trademarks

640
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:05,640
mean at the open source community is a
little averse to

641
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:09,900
any kind of intellectual property and
having to deal with lawyers and you know

642
00:37:09,900 --> 00:37:14,110
cease and desist and that kind of things
but I actually believe the trademarks

643
00:37:14,110 --> 00:37:17,080
are important and you know people can
have different opinions

644
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:20,160
in because I tried to think of it this
way see

645
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:24,480
someone use my name or my photo in
something that I really really don't

646
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:26,430
agree with something that I found

647
00:37:26,430 --> 00:37:31,299
outrageous or really really harmful I
would not want that so I think companies

648
00:37:31,300 --> 00:37:34,500
thinking it in the same terms for
example like you don't want

649
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:38,420
like I can completely understand that
the their clone side of taiwan

650
00:37:38,420 --> 00:37:42,220
I've been a closet don't work this
simply don't work you buy the more than

651
00:37:42,220 --> 00:37:43,720
it does nothing

652
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:47,840
and if they actually heading out to be
no name on it they'll be really harmful

653
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:51,780
for the company up so it's a way to
protect your customers

654
00:37:51,780 --> 00:37:55,300
because then they know that they are
buying like something that you made in

655
00:37:55,300 --> 00:37:57,630
that they can go to you for any problems

656
00:37:57,630 --> 00:38:01,380
if they buy a clone that has your stamp
on it and there's no saying you know

657
00:38:01,380 --> 00:38:04,650
how that's gonna hand or if you even
protect that have customer service I

658
00:38:04,650 --> 00:38:05,460
anything

659
00:38:05,460 --> 00:38:08,460
said to really protect everyone just
trying to think if it intended like

660
00:38:08,460 --> 00:38:12,100
would you want someone to use your name
on something that she didn't in

661
00:38:12,100 --> 00:38:15,440
when the making of last year to open 100
per minute when are you know gave the

662
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:16,360
keynote was that

663
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:20,400
they don't miss earlier and like it when
people name their project is something

664
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:21,520
we know

665
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:24,630
that's not originally third and so just
because the

666
00:38:24,630 --> 00:38:27,990
used not the first two letters are
hardly know

667
00:38:27,990 --> 00:38:31,100
doesn't mean that you didn't kind
popular name

668
00:38:31,100 --> 00:38:35,779
so I when these they encouraged anyhow
I'm hungry derivatives and shield on

669
00:38:35,780 --> 00:38:39,200
that to say something like hardly a
compatible but don't call it

670
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:44,300
the new do we know her something like
that

671
00:38:44,300 --> 00:38:49,820
a the questions I have this hot the
promised the signing PCB layouts

672
00:38:49,820 --> 00:38:54,020
open source hardware what resources
exists for discussing

673
00:38:54,020 --> 00:39:00,050
open source or otherwise non-commercial
software for hobbyists developers

674
00:39:00,050 --> 00:39:04,130
I obviously there's a plethora of
commercial packages for their car

675
00:39:04,130 --> 00:39:06,220
substantial amount of money

676
00:39:06,220 --> 00:39:10,350
and for somebody on a hobbyist much
might not be feasible

677
00:39:10,350 --> 00:39:13,759
and South the open source packages range

678
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:18,810
different qualities and it's kinda hard
to get a total overview without really

679
00:39:18,810 --> 00:39:23,720
funding is your former wiki that just
lists all the packages

680
00:39:23,720 --> 00:39:29,460
their different experiences with people

681
00:39:29,460 --> 00:39:33,510
do you mean am software packages think
design tools

682
00:39:33,510 --> 00:39:36,890
yes okay and well London today see all
the time

683
00:39:36,890 --> 00:39:40,589
a mechanical engineer by training so I
don't use it after his your

684
00:39:40,590 --> 00:39:45,640
cuz Eagles version and it's free is you
can design worth attending four inches

685
00:39:45,640 --> 00:39:46,710
by 3 inches

686
00:39:46,710 --> 00:39:51,109
as single air and time that people have
you that's our company's if it started

687
00:39:51,109 --> 00:39:53,450
that way smartphones are that where'd
you know

688
00:39:53,450 --> 00:39:57,180
I use that and then and this story is
that so

689
00:39:57,180 --> 00:40:01,109
again seen early protests in a different
words before they

690
00:40:01,109 --> 00:40:05,350
but the pro version heavy guard
stringing together with ribbon cable

691
00:40:05,350 --> 00:40:09,230
boards that are for i three in 4 1-3 in
for a 3-2 they get theirs

692
00:40:09,230 --> 00:40:13,890
big designers for free and so the next
steps out there is not a different you

693
00:40:13,890 --> 00:40:16,470
know that legal pro there's our team
designer there's lots of different

694
00:40:16,470 --> 00:40:18,330
really expensive

695
00:40:18,330 --> 00:40:22,880
add a whole range 'em suffer too was
that an airstrike at as an airline which

696
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:24,620
is a totally open source

697
00:40:24,620 --> 00:40:27,980
and T previously effort saying there's

698
00:40:27,980 --> 00:40:31,980
as another one fitting that art has
their own have breadboard

699
00:40:31,980 --> 00:40:35,480
visual router that loss at his command
accident board layouts to

700
00:40:35,480 --> 00:40:39,590
so there's new players in this space and
you can definitely make things like that

701
00:40:39,590 --> 00:40:40,540
painter money for her

702
00:40:40,540 --> 00:40:43,940
for safire

703
00:40:43,940 --> 00:40:47,290
the it be nice if there was a farmer
something available

704
00:40:47,290 --> 00:40:52,630
that all the pros and cons can be
discussed about the different packages

705
00:40:52,630 --> 00:40:55,890
this way it's not just by word about
their are

706
00:40:55,890 --> 00:40:59,560
various sources there's just one place
for everybody

707
00:40:59,560 --> 00:41:03,700
to discuss thats a software

708
00:41:03,700 --> 00:41:06,910
soviet mean this in the first of all
thank you for the suggestion because so

709
00:41:06,910 --> 00:41:09,799
this is like something that we now know
we need to think of

710
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:14,070
for example for Ashlea which is to try
and make that information available cuz

711
00:41:14,070 --> 00:41:17,310
we thought everyone would know but of
course it's not true

712
00:41:17,310 --> 00:41:20,790
your thing I find interesting here's ned
I'm

713
00:41:20,790 --> 00:41:23,750
this is one of the fundamental
differences between do you open source

714
00:41:23,750 --> 00:41:24,550
software

715
00:41:24,550 --> 00:41:28,750
in hard-hit communities is at open
source software is collaborative

716
00:41:28,750 --> 00:41:33,380
by nature to have you know hundred
thousand people working towards the same

717
00:41:33,380 --> 00:41:35,390
project at the same time

718
00:41:35,390 --> 00:41:38,569
and in open source hardware because its
native Adams

719
00:41:38,570 --> 00:41:42,600
that doesn't happen so open source
hardware speech but if its derivative

720
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:45,600
like you make your board someone else
pills and insulin all spills on it but

721
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:48,240
not everyone is working towards one
release

722
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:51,670
so that's probably why would not as good
at Latino creating packages

723
00:41:51,670 --> 00:41:55,580
the and thinking in those terms but I
guess we should take a cue from the open

724
00:41:55,580 --> 00:41:56,390
source earn

725
00:41:56,390 --> 00:42:02,790
softer community and shut thinking mind
Windows terms

726
00:42:02,790 --> 00:42:05,930
actually playing a bit of %uh we just
heard about on the hardware

727
00:42:05,930 --> 00:42:09,419
being more on derivative a

728
00:42:09,420 --> 00:42:12,740
I was involved with the as using a
couple

729
00:42:12,740 --> 00:42:16,710
projects is working with caltrans mine
were things actually came up

730
00:42:16,710 --> 00:42:20,720
the Cup times was I'm just the supply
line

731
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:23,980
are more things that your engine they
give love

732
00:42:23,980 --> 00:42:28,130
I'm near see this is a spahn home and
all the whole Rep wraps up

733
00:42:28,130 --> 00:42:31,700
the and I was green I have a lot of
people working on it and a lot of the

734
00:42:31,700 --> 00:42:32,910
items particularly

735
00:42:32,910 --> 00:42:36,790
use similar parts are taking what you
said earlier Acme threaded rod sir

736
00:42:36,790 --> 00:42:40,050
a very commenting for draw lines

737
00:42:40,050 --> 00:42:44,060
I'll more things I was thinking has any
thought given to

738
00:42:44,060 --> 00:42:47,810
on exclusivity advertising write
anything on those on example

739
00:42:47,810 --> 00:42:51,680
massacres a big so we buy a lot of
things from in New Jersey area

740
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:54,950
arm perhaps a.m. if a new

741
00:42:54,950 --> 00:42:58,030
if the repre- community were too at
least

742
00:42:58,030 --> 00:43:02,150
advertised taking a midterm sonic a deal
with the company whereby they can lower

743
00:43:02,150 --> 00:43:04,710
the threat lower the price supports

744
00:43:04,710 --> 00:43:06,390
by are

745
00:43:06,390 --> 00:43:10,370
offering exclusivity advertising on
certain web sites or other things along

746
00:43:10,370 --> 00:43:11,000
those lines

747
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:15,810
or in another kind away trying to bring
you down by offering on

748
00:43:15,810 --> 00:43:20,220
book purchases like 10 people building
wraps across the country

749
00:43:20,220 --> 00:43:24,010
come together and puts together in order
for

750
00:43:24,010 --> 00:43:27,680
all other parts and at the same time
thereby trying to hit the thrush remarks

751
00:43:27,680 --> 00:43:30,890
for all put quantity which brings on
cost

752
00:43:30,890 --> 00:43:34,420
mister like with his ex second on the
team harbor is

753
00:43:34,420 --> 00:43:38,090
Adams and a lot of the boundary the
minimum value their

754
00:43:38,090 --> 00:43:41,920
is unfortunately money its how much can
you afford to do some striking

755
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:45,710
start eating about from the finances
their ways up doing is kinda

756
00:43:45,710 --> 00:43:49,760
methods to try to bring down the floor
on the cost

757
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:53,500
thing hello

758
00:43:53,500 --> 00:43:58,270
yeah one thing and is that the customer
them bring people together to eating

759
00:43:58,270 --> 00:44:01,560
do something like that is almost zero
now I mean you can start to meet up from

760
00:44:01,560 --> 00:44:02,810
anywhere and meet attack on

761
00:44:02,810 --> 00:44:05,840
anywhere in the world even if you don't
have a local hackers paster

762
00:44:05,840 --> 00:44:09,000
kinda get people together to do

763
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:13,210
a joint purchase like that but also and
you know how companies are also a great

764
00:44:13,210 --> 00:44:14,230
place to find

765
00:44:14,230 --> 00:44:18,470
you know like minded people or friends
ans friends a friend and then that are

766
00:44:18,470 --> 00:44:20,830
like-minded people to do a vocoder like
that

767
00:44:20,830 --> 00:44:24,210
but I think that as far as like talking
to the master and stuff like that

768
00:44:24,210 --> 00:44:27,570
to get and discounts the iraqis is not
big enough

769
00:44:27,570 --> 00:44:31,370
to make it worthwhile for them to offer
a discount on 400

770
00:44:31,370 --> 00:44:35,529
still rides or something like that
whereas you do get book

771
00:44:35,530 --> 00:44:39,400
discount anyway when you buy 400 verses
wine usually

772
00:44:39,400 --> 00:44:42,930
and add master on the a price break at
10 or you know 100 or something like

773
00:44:42,930 --> 00:44:43,779
that sour

774
00:44:43,780 --> 00:44:47,640
it may be a tad ass at this point cell
testimony people to get those price

775
00:44:47,640 --> 00:44:48,480
breaks but

776
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:53,350
I love it if there is there you know
hackerspace checkbox and master

777
00:44:53,350 --> 00:44:57,620
check out farm be good assemble a
pension group together and do it and

778
00:44:57,620 --> 00:45:00,819
in the electronics fabrication and
already doing that there's an

779
00:45:00,820 --> 00:45:03,840
but is it backs police badge PCB that

780
00:45:03,840 --> 00:45:08,950
and great respect for me from and there
is that there's a PC user as they grow

781
00:45:08,950 --> 00:45:10,840
to the Pittsburgh dark black community

782
00:45:10,840 --> 00:45:15,230
add where he based his doing the same
thing my car key million designs Int'l

783
00:45:15,230 --> 00:45:16,720
he's got enough for a piano

784
00:45:16,720 --> 00:45:20,450
and then send it off that once they may
have the way to three weeks for your

785
00:45:20,450 --> 00:45:24,370
I designed to get back to you but only
way she buried in his where you're from

786
00:45:24,370 --> 00:45:28,109
then circuits or something so I haven't
seen someone of her service like that

787
00:45:28,110 --> 00:45:28,690
for

788
00:45:28,690 --> 00:45:32,600
Harbor Park CA may be able to start that
and say that but I gotta order

789
00:45:32,600 --> 00:45:36,820
and that people interested in a hundred
amnesty or other ever i buy them

790
00:45:36,820 --> 00:45:40,290
and I'll send them to you but now I
haven't seen that yet

791
00:45:40,290 --> 00:45:44,370
I

792
00:45:44,370 --> 00:45:48,130
I was just coming up a in Ross the
question to russians go

793
00:45:48,130 --> 00:45:51,410
I'm actually giving a talk here tomorrow
night at nine

794
00:45:51,410 --> 00:45:55,220
designing free hardware and its in
particularly about using

795
00:45:55,220 --> 00:45:58,720
free and open source tools to bill from
start to finish

796
00:45:58,720 --> 00:46:03,000
your hardware and it produced and
everything doesn't that so and actually

797
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:06,600
compare similar the different tools
they're available and you miss G to

798
00:46:06,600 --> 00:46:10,340
G is the best what's your for instance

799
00:46:10,340 --> 00:46:13,580
GPL electronic design automation its a

800
00:46:13,580 --> 00:46:16,990
the by far I think the best

801
00:46:16,990 --> 00:46:21,330
free software tool for designing PCB's
that %uh them to me

802
00:46:21,330 --> 00:46:25,450
me ask you will first ask everyone to go
to have talkin thinking and if you have

803
00:46:25,450 --> 00:46:28,800
if you can publisher site anywhere or
anything to you

804
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:34,320
seventy awesome matters now from well

805
00:46:34,320 --> 00:46:38,470
one more question %uh which is another
you know you work at work

806
00:46:38,470 --> 00:46:42,910
robots and all that so on basically
think there's a lot of open source

807
00:46:42,910 --> 00:46:43,700
learning

808
00:46:43,700 --> 00:46:47,150
robotic platforms all coming out the
smallest them but San

809
00:46:47,150 --> 00:46:50,200
all that so is that you think that's an
area that

810
00:46:50,200 --> 00:46:53,240
in terms of answers that there's still
more opportunity or zone area that

811
00:46:53,240 --> 00:46:55,560
there's a lot of competition enters
getting locked into

812
00:46:55,560 --> 00:46:59,180
I'm just wondering in terms of lycopene
sorcery can

813
00:46:59,180 --> 00:47:03,629
do something but trying to compete for
everybody's attention for your open

814
00:47:03,630 --> 00:47:04,200
source bi

815
00:47:04,200 --> 00:47:09,800
is a tricky and yeah I guess it's gonna
catch 22 think kinda want more players

816
00:47:09,800 --> 00:47:11,870
in the market for you get this kind of
natural

817
00:47:11,870 --> 00:47:15,230
abolition that far as talking out were
and

818
00:47:15,230 --> 00:47:19,190
to larger ecosystem the different
players the better back and

819
00:47:19,190 --> 00:47:22,470
I also since I am in schools until

820
00:47:22,470 --> 00:47:27,290
I A see a lot of their the teaching
tools are still very closed

821
00:47:27,290 --> 00:47:30,440
tell cost thousands of dollars to get
like a MATLAB in

822
00:47:30,440 --> 00:47:35,250
and robotic arm set out from on some
company that specializes in Mad Ants

823
00:47:35,250 --> 00:47:38,710
very close it is not something and his
team ever be able to replicate on their

824
00:47:38,710 --> 00:47:39,190
own

825
00:47:39,190 --> 00:47:43,490
without me know thousands and thousands
of dollars so lower-cost educational

826
00:47:43,490 --> 00:47:47,160
kits not just for college labs that may
have money for expenses to

827
00:47:47,160 --> 00:47:50,279
class at high school and and middle
school

828
00:47:50,280 --> 00:47:53,300
pre-engineering level summer camp stuff
like that I think there's definitely a

829
00:47:53,300 --> 00:47:54,750
big opportunity there

830
00:47:54,750 --> 00:47:58,680
for am robotics tape skips and

831
00:47:58,680 --> 00:48:02,529
teaching classes our guests and third
we're not building a robotic arm in and

832
00:48:02,530 --> 00:48:05,950
had to make my own kit for it cuz the
only ones that were available for

833
00:48:05,950 --> 00:48:09,800
the handlers and I can change that for
you noticing lasso

834
00:48:09,800 --> 00:48:13,200
it'll be interesting to see am in that
turned me on

835
00:48:13,200 --> 00:48:17,130
derivative know kept their word we're
trying to work out so

836
00:48:17,130 --> 00:48:20,820
and you have ideas about how to work
that in the community and he talked

837
00:48:20,820 --> 00:48:26,480
about eleven to hear them to you

838
00:48:26,480 --> 00:48:30,490
questions okay well thank you so much
for

839
00:48:30,490 --> 00:48:34,550
you know listening and for your
contributions and questions

840
00:48:34,550 --> 00:48:39,230
will be around wanna continue the
discussion was the other than that

841
00:48:39,230 --> 00:48:39,480
%ah
