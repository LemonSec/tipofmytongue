1
00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:03,350
I could see them as well as he can so

2
00:00:03,350 --> 00:00:07,120
ladies and gentlemen I would like to

3
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:10,120
I would like to present mister Stephen
Brown Band

4
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:14,900
helping

5
00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:17,910
or

6
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:22,029
can you hear those okay great I

7
00:00:22,029 --> 00:00:25,460
my name is Steve from Obama's I was just
reminded

8
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:30,660
I had the great pleasure of speaking at
every single hope since the very first

9
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:31,420
one

10
00:00:31,420 --> 00:00:36,920
which means the I have been speaking at
home conferences since

11
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:40,390
before some other people in this room
before there's

12
00:00:40,390 --> 00:00:45,600
frightening I thought as the others and
I will try not to

13
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:48,680
come offers a crotchety

14
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:52,910
whole some her I'll

15
00:00:52,910 --> 00:00:55,940
I've also been giving the stalk since

16
00:00:55,940 --> 00:00:59,718
97 the

17
00:00:59,719 --> 00:01:03,670
97 a manual came to me and said we
really

18
00:01:03,670 --> 00:01:06,689
would like a different point of view

19
00:01:06,689 --> 00:01:10,280
with like the investigator's point of
view and I gave her

20
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:14,180
a lot of 4 and

21
00:01:14,180 --> 00:01:18,540
survey my colleagues also lemme

22
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:21,720
essentially said don't do don't go

23
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:25,830
these people are criminals there
miscreants

24
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:30,820
the I think our people %ah

25
00:01:30,820 --> 00:01:35,250
The Hague haha they are on the other
side up

26
00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:39,990
the up the aisle so to speak and having

27
00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:43,350
had been to the hope in ninety four i'm
new

28
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:47,149
quite well that wasn't true some may be
for the guy in the skies in the front

29
00:01:47,149 --> 00:01:48,009
row there's a guy

30
00:01:48,009 --> 00:01:51,909
you can see this but there's a guy
sitting here weren't stand-up

31
00:01:51,909 --> 00:01:55,680
said %ah don't be shocked these were the
Groucho Marx the horse

32
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:59,170
glasses sitting in the front row sucks
up for him

33
00:01:59,170 --> 00:02:04,610
other yeah that's right it may not be at
the scars

34
00:02:04,610 --> 00:02:09,119
so I spoke in ninety-seven

35
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:13,000
and it was wonderful and

36
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,730
as I'm since discovered there

37
00:02:16,730 --> 00:02:20,709
here's a real similarity

38
00:02:20,709 --> 00:02:23,849
between myself and my colleagues

39
00:02:23,849 --> 00:02:28,609
and the people who come to the ok
comforts you are

40
00:02:28,610 --> 00:02:32,970
essentially very very aggressive
investigators

41
00:02:32,970 --> 00:02:36,920
are you wont to

42
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:42,849
get down to the root level in cyberspace
and I want to get down

43
00:02:42,849 --> 00:02:48,488
I wanna get route the meat spence and
there's not a whole lot of difference

44
00:02:48,489 --> 00:02:49,180
there

45
00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:53,800
you're fine things up you want to know
what's what so do investigators

46
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:58,530
and I have to tell you what I come to
these conferences the next day

47
00:02:58,530 --> 00:03:04,879
I have an IQ about 20 points higher than
what I came to the conference it's it's

48
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:06,149
just wonderful coming year

49
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:10,080
so now after 18 years it's

50
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:14,629
its like being with fam and

51
00:03:14,629 --> 00:03:19,950
and i'm glad to be here we are going to

52
00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:24,819
thanks bro we are going to

53
00:03:24,819 --> 00:03:28,580
cover today a less

54
00:03:28,580 --> 00:03:33,409
over toward the horizon than I normally
do for those of you who are here in

55
00:03:33,409 --> 00:03:37,980
2008 2010 2006

56
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:41,390
and a half at the Stevens conference
because

57
00:03:41,390 --> 00:03:44,409
a summer you know my talk in 2006 was

58
00:03:44,409 --> 00:03:47,579
was interrupted let's I

59
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:51,420
arm anybody's attended

60
00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:55,689
my talk at the last few hopes knows the
I typically have

61
00:03:55,689 --> 00:03:59,569
a privacy victim and a specific

62
00:03:59,569 --> 00:04:02,959
investigation that I put up on the
screen and I show you

63
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:07,650
how it's done and how the fact that
privacy is that is used by

64
00:04:07,650 --> 00:04:12,099
investigators um we're not gonna do that
this year but I do want to

65
00:04:12,099 --> 00:04:15,680
for for Africa I wanna thank Casey

66
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:20,989
any trouble early Nick daily he joined
James Jorge loco

67
00:04:20,989 --> 00:04:24,250
probably not a real name and WebDAV

68
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:28,330
definitely not a real name for
volunteering this Privacy victims

69
00:04:28,330 --> 00:04:30,270
unfortunately they volunteered

70
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:33,330
within the past few days and I just
didn't have

71
00:04:33,330 --> 00:04:36,330
sufficient time to do a worthwhile

72
00:04:36,330 --> 00:04:39,349
part ology exam on them so a

73
00:04:39,350 --> 00:04:44,639
there will be no privacy that there will
however be

74
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:51,639
some actual case starts for those %uh
view that overturned at the store

75
00:04:53,229 --> 00:04:58,090
the first five minutes ago in to be
repetitive for those of you that haven't

76
00:04:58,090 --> 00:05:02,490
let me tell you what this is about
because of the changes

77
00:05:02,490 --> 00:05:07,419
in surveillance technologies because of
the changes in computing power

78
00:05:07,419 --> 00:05:10,539
because of the changes in database

79
00:05:10,539 --> 00:05:16,280
aggregation most the ball because of
9/11

80
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:19,570
it is now possible starting with

81
00:05:19,570 --> 00:05:24,800
any piece of information anything a
telephone number license plate and email

82
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:25,720
address

83
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:30,449
a photograph of any single piece of
information

84
00:05:30,449 --> 00:05:33,990
it is possible to grab a stranger poll
and pull

85
00:05:33,990 --> 00:05:37,190
and Paul and end up with

86
00:05:37,190 --> 00:05:40,840
a person's entire life down to the level

87
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:44,030
love what they think what they believe

88
00:05:44,030 --> 00:05:47,949
what they do who their families who
their friends or

89
00:05:47,949 --> 00:05:51,860
where they war yesterday where they were
the day before

90
00:05:51,860 --> 00:05:55,690
where they are right now who they hang
out with

91
00:05:55,690 --> 00:06:00,199
everything with out leaving your desk

92
00:06:00,199 --> 00:06:05,130
are it's almost surveillance teams are
almost superfluous now they're not

93
00:06:05,130 --> 00:06:08,180
yet thank God or I would be eating

94
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:11,370
cat food but I'll and

95
00:06:11,370 --> 00:06:15,729
please no cadmium jokes now

96
00:06:15,729 --> 00:06:19,370
here it is possible from any piece of
information

97
00:06:19,370 --> 00:06:23,650
to get a name address or phone number
data for the social security number

98
00:06:23,650 --> 00:06:27,729
all love the obvious things and some not
obvious things

99
00:06:27,729 --> 00:06:30,849
photo sexual orientation race religion

100
00:06:30,850 --> 00:06:34,380
politics Hobbins habits medical history

101
00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:39,530
not a problem there are massive
aggregated medical databases now

102
00:06:39,530 --> 00:06:42,690
where you work what you sell Rios

103
00:06:42,690 --> 00:06:46,880
your criminal history all the lawsuits
you've been involved in as a plaintiff

104
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:47,789
is the founder

105
00:06:47,789 --> 00:06:51,250
or witness real property everything
you've

106
00:06:51,250 --> 00:06:55,250
ever purchased and everywhere you ever
go on

107
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:59,289
everything you've ever dog that is in a
marketing database

108
00:06:59,289 --> 00:07:02,409
as we're gonna discuss this is not
because people want to invade your

109
00:07:02,410 --> 00:07:03,389
privacy

110
00:07:03,389 --> 00:07:06,770
has because people wanna sell you things

111
00:07:06,770 --> 00:07:11,979
your information is worth money your
privacy is not being invaded today by

112
00:07:11,979 --> 00:07:13,130
Big Brother

113
00:07:13,130 --> 00:07:18,250
it's being invaded by big marker and
we're gonna talk about that

114
00:07:18,250 --> 00:07:23,780
one of the biggest changes is the
ability to track your physical location

115
00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:27,160
I'm sorry I came in at the tail end of
the previous

116
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:30,690
a talk I heard them talking about

117
00:07:30,690 --> 00:07:34,780
surveying cell phones where the drone

118
00:07:34,780 --> 00:07:37,840
in a wide area this is something that is
done

119
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:43,090
routinely now I can tell you that
everybody that attended an Occupy Wall

120
00:07:43,090 --> 00:07:45,220
Street protest

121
00:07:45,220 --> 00:07:49,240
and didn't earn their cell phone of or
put it and

122
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:54,210
sometimes even if they did the identity
of that cell phone

123
00:07:54,210 --> 00:07:58,550
has been logged and everybody who was at
that demonstration

124
00:07:58,550 --> 00:08:02,599
whether they were arrested not arrested
where their photos were ID

125
00:08:02,599 --> 00:08:06,789
weather and former pointed them out it's
known they were there any way

126
00:08:06,789 --> 00:08:11,810
this is routine I can tell you that if
you go into any police station right now

127
00:08:11,810 --> 00:08:15,270
in the city of new york. the first thing
they do is tell you ons are you not

128
00:08:15,270 --> 00:08:16,780
allowed to bring a cell phone in their

129
00:08:16,780 --> 00:08:20,379
will hold it for you not a joke

130
00:08:20,379 --> 00:08:23,509
and by the way it's a it's a legitimate
investigatory

131
00:08:23,509 --> 00:08:27,300
technique but cell phones are now

132
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:31,120
the Little Snitch in your pocket cell
phones tell me

133
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:34,810
where you are what you do who you talk
to

134
00:08:34,810 --> 00:08:38,140
everybody you associate with

135
00:08:38,140 --> 00:08:42,218
so phone tells me intimate details of
your life and character

136
00:08:42,219 --> 00:08:46,110
including were you at a demonstration

137
00:08:46,110 --> 00:08:49,899
did you attend a mosque did you
demonstrate in front of an abortion

138
00:08:49,899 --> 00:08:50,959
clinic

139
00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:54,500
did you get an abortion

140
00:08:54,500 --> 00:09:01,500
no haggling please

141
00:09:01,589 --> 00:09:02,660
well

142
00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:07,189
so we're gonna have to pull this off
today

143
00:09:07,190 --> 00:09:11,240
we are not going to talk about
government databases

144
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:15,620
we're not going to talk about big
brother frankly Big Brother

145
00:09:15,620 --> 00:09:20,220
is an amateur I can tell you just on the
top 100 rolls

146
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:24,730
these people are talking about 4,000
drone hours I can tell you a year

147
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:29,910
are being flown by by CBP by Customs and
Border Patrol

148
00:09:29,910 --> 00:09:33,870
and by the way the left out a whole
bunch of agencies every federal agencies

149
00:09:33,870 --> 00:09:34,940
using drones self

150
00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:40,450
even environmental protection agencies
use of drones private industry

151
00:09:40,450 --> 00:09:44,810
is flying 20 drone hours for every
governmental drone I'll

152
00:09:44,810 --> 00:09:49,370
everything that the government is doing

153
00:09:49,370 --> 00:09:53,490
private industry is doing better and
more extensively

154
00:09:53,490 --> 00:09:56,700
we are going to cover today

155
00:09:56,700 --> 00:10:00,590
only open source only privately held
stuff

156
00:10:00,590 --> 00:10:05,690
no governmental database what were
specially going to cover

157
00:10:05,690 --> 00:10:10,260
is the information that you contribute
you know

158
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:14,130
it's too late for a wake-up call for
most the people in this room

159
00:10:14,130 --> 00:10:17,340
because everything there is to know
about everyone in this room

160
00:10:17,340 --> 00:10:21,670
has already been gathered and indexed
and distributed

161
00:10:21,670 --> 00:10:28,079
an amalgamated and cross-referenced but
you'll need to know what's going on

162
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:31,770
if you are going to give up your
information you should at least be doing

163
00:10:31,770 --> 00:10:32,020
it

164
00:10:32,020 --> 00:10:35,150
openly knowingly now

165
00:10:35,150 --> 00:10:39,069
when I come in I give these talks about
to non

166
00:10:39,070 --> 00:10:42,820
law-enforcement groups I typically do a
water two day

167
00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:45,990
full session on this topic flawed force

168
00:10:45,990 --> 00:10:50,120
I teach them how to use open source
information

169
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:54,540
hand use marketing databases how to use
proprietary information to do their job

170
00:10:54,540 --> 00:10:54,980
better

171
00:10:54,980 --> 00:10:58,690
I am an investigator I think that there
are legitimate reasons

172
00:10:58,690 --> 00:11:03,200
for law enforcement investigators have
access to the stuff legitimate reasons

173
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:07,750
good reasons reasons to the better for
of everyone in this room

174
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:10,930
but

175
00:11:10,930 --> 00:11:15,100
I'm a little schizophrenic on this issue

176
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:19,770
on one hand everyone in this room gives
up their name their address the social

177
00:11:19,770 --> 00:11:21,600
security number the date of birth

178
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:25,700
where they go what they do where they
hang out their photos

179
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:29,580
they check in every word they tweet from
everywhere they do

180
00:11:29,580 --> 00:11:34,330
Facebook updates from everywhere and I
can do my investigation of new

181
00:11:34,330 --> 00:11:37,589
without leaving my office and and by the
way

182
00:11:37,589 --> 00:11:40,620
thank you very much I I appreciate it

183
00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:45,710
but on the other hand I'm in america and
it creeps me out as an american that

184
00:11:45,710 --> 00:11:46,870
there's this much

185
00:11:46,870 --> 00:11:52,230
information available so I'm really hi
I'm really on a knife's edge here a

186
00:11:52,230 --> 00:11:53,820
little schizophrenic about this

187
00:11:53,820 --> 00:12:00,080
are I decided that the the most
honorable thing to do

188
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:03,660
and the most appropriate thing to do is
the not have an opinion when I give the

189
00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:04,240
stock

190
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:08,610
I am NOT going and I say this every time
I talk at hope every whirls

191
00:12:08,610 --> 00:12:13,400
I am NOT going to tell you what to think
I am hopefully going to tell you what to

192
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:14,110
think about

193
00:12:14,110 --> 00:12:17,300
and I'm gonna give you all the
information so you can make up your own

194
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:17,710
mind

195
00:12:17,710 --> 00:12:21,339
today

196
00:12:21,339 --> 00:12:26,660
we are not going to do the full monty we
are going to concentrate on these areas

197
00:12:26,660 --> 00:12:27,150
here

198
00:12:27,150 --> 00:12:30,890
Google Facebook and the colonization of
the other

199
00:12:30,890 --> 00:12:34,520
cell phones GPS and tracking profiling

200
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:38,850
cameras and drones in the things related
to that and D anonymous says:

201
00:12:38,850 --> 00:12:45,850
min lop

202
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:53,959
hello

ok these are the o'rourke

205
00:13:03,009 --> 00:13:06,660
is there a navy Emergency Squad

206
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:08,699
it up

207
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:11,220
you

208
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:12,790
get away from this microphone

209
00:13:12,790 --> 00:13:17,899
supper

210
00:13:17,899 --> 00:13:21,610
Google technical support

211
00:13:21,610 --> 00:13:26,940
always there when you need knock okay

212
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:31,490
arm these are the key areas

213
00:13:31,490 --> 00:13:35,649
rather than try to cover everything
which for those %uh view here

214
00:13:35,649 --> 00:13:40,149
last year no course me to run into a
fourth hour and

215
00:13:40,149 --> 00:13:45,589
a guy with the big book pull me off the
stage today what we're going to do is

216
00:13:45,589 --> 00:13:49,240
we are actually going to do this within
the allotted time

217
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:52,339
I'm gonna leave enough time to take a
few questions

218
00:13:52,339 --> 00:13:56,020
by the way this year no t-shirts I'm
giving away

219
00:13:56,020 --> 00:13:59,170
covert surveillance devices to the
people to

220
00:13:59,170 --> 00:14:03,529
ask the questions it just seems a little
more fitting and believe it or not

221
00:14:03,529 --> 00:14:06,880
as an example of where technology is
these are actually cheaper than two

222
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:07,410
shirts

223
00:14:07,410 --> 00:14:10,540
no no fooling

224
00:14:10,540 --> 00:14:15,160
no fooling these were I think there's a
pretty good once a record for two hours

225
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:15,630
little

226
00:14:15,630 --> 00:14:19,160
many chip for video and audio and

227
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:24,459
they cost about $13 dollars on e-bay
which is cheaper than a good

228
00:14:24,459 --> 00:14:29,680
printed haynes teacher fright so we're
gonna cover these things 100

229
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:36,680
up tap

230
00:14:37,029 --> 00:14:40,550
okay how about a wire

231
00:14:40,550 --> 00:14:46,900
for is this

232
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:50,050
damn

233
00:14:50,050 --> 00:14:53,440
are who's screwing with my

234
00:14:53,440 --> 00:15:00,440
the

235
00:15:03,670 --> 00:15:06,960
I the moose is making me very suspicious

236
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:10,920
yeah

237
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:14,010
well your

238
00:15:14,010 --> 00:15:18,210
welcome to track to give you my god save
save yourself the trouble just call me

239
00:15:18,210 --> 00:15:19,070
up they were

240
00:15:19,070 --> 00:15:22,089
I'm we go if we can carpool

241
00:15:22,089 --> 00:15:26,320
I actually

242
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:31,760
I actually I just want you to know this
is actually true two days before the FBI

243
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:35,790
came in here and interrupted my talk in
2006 which

244
00:15:35,790 --> 00:15:39,550
is probably the best thing that ever
happened if I could

245
00:15:39,550 --> 00:15:43,589
get arrested by the FBI every five or
six years I'd be a billionaire

246
00:15:43,589 --> 00:15:47,850
I'm the published today I got from the
the trouble they got into it was

247
00:15:47,850 --> 00:15:52,570
was amazing arm but two days before

248
00:15:52,570 --> 00:15:56,339
they were just painfully erupted
following me

249
00:15:56,339 --> 00:16:00,310
and I actually did walk over to this guy
was following you know to look

250
00:16:00,310 --> 00:16:05,310
we had brought together guy rolled up
the window and drove no

251
00:16:05,310 --> 00:16:10,330
and and by the way you know I'm not I'm
not saying I'm

252
00:16:10,330 --> 00:16:13,500
I actually felt like a jerk after I mean
these guys are my

253
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:16,780
are my colleagues for better or worse so
I kinda

254
00:16:16,780 --> 00:16:21,220
I kinda felt better arm and I regularly
work with

255
00:16:21,220 --> 00:16:24,530
with federal agencies but it was just I
guess

256
00:16:24,530 --> 00:16:27,900
so insulting to them that two days later
they

257
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:31,760
came in here there was a hole in the
home schedule

258
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:35,670
arm so

259
00:16:35,670 --> 00:16:39,540
okay back to the serious stuff

260
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:43,339
I'm gonna go through this like a speed
freak for about two and a half hours

261
00:16:43,339 --> 00:16:46,940
we are going to cover these primary
topics

262
00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:50,530
we're gonna leave some time for Q&A I
have

263
00:16:50,530 --> 00:16:54,400
here with me today Bruce Ackman who is
the director the Society of Professional

264
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:55,790
investigators

265
00:16:55,790 --> 00:16:59,529
here's a remarkable expert his own right

266
00:16:59,529 --> 00:17:04,199
on or things that active related and
he's gonna help me with the Q&A in the

267
00:17:04,199 --> 00:17:05,850
Bruce and I are going to go

268
00:17:05,849 --> 00:17:10,448
a not sure where somebody should
probably tell me down to the 64

269
00:17:10,449 --> 00:17:12,130
somewhere where they've given us a room

270
00:17:12,130 --> 00:17:16,780
we've got an hour to do anything that
anybody wants talk to you privately

271
00:17:16,780 --> 00:17:20,310
answer questions you can come and play
with my databases

272
00:17:20,310 --> 00:17:23,369
whatever your so onward upward

273
00:17:23,370 --> 00:17:26,589
here is how it used to be

274
00:17:26,589 --> 00:17:29,790
back in the stone age if you have a
phone

275
00:17:29,790 --> 00:17:33,230
and then you add your name and address
and then a date of birth and social

276
00:17:33,230 --> 00:17:34,380
security number

277
00:17:34,380 --> 00:17:40,400
and the addresses family PO e business
corporations and so on and so on and so

278
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:41,580
on and so on

279
00:17:41,580 --> 00:17:44,659
each would be a separate step

280
00:17:44,660 --> 00:17:48,620
until finally you had and by the way
this

281
00:17:48,620 --> 00:17:52,150
was considered one time a pretty

282
00:17:52,150 --> 00:17:56,920
darn good BR background investigation
this is now

283
00:17:56,920 --> 00:18:00,500
a starting point you don't need to do
this today

284
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:04,970
you immediately take a phone number and
you get a comprehensive report

285
00:18:04,970 --> 00:18:08,370
although this is cross-referenced all of
this is linked

286
00:18:08,370 --> 00:18:13,230
every private investigator every bill
recovery agent every security expert

287
00:18:13,230 --> 00:18:14,910
every law enforcement officer

288
00:18:14,910 --> 00:18:19,030
can plug in any one piece of data and
immediately it sucks it

289
00:18:19,030 --> 00:18:23,139
all the cross reference data the problem
is sometimes it's not accurate but

290
00:18:23,140 --> 00:18:25,990
that's another story so

291
00:18:25,990 --> 00:18:29,290
here's what's changed in the past 15
years for civil

292
00:18:29,290 --> 00:18:32,760
computing power and speed I can now

293
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:36,010
raw nerve my office and do run out of my
office

294
00:18:36,010 --> 00:18:39,740
a network that is faster

295
00:18:39,740 --> 00:18:43,330
more powerful bigger database does more

296
00:18:43,330 --> 00:18:46,520
than what the FBI had twenty years ago
and that's literally true

297
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:52,400
storage costs dropping 20 you can go to
office max Unger 3 terabyte drive

298
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:56,840
a three terabyte drive for 169 box

299
00:18:56,840 --> 00:19:00,510
when I started out as an investigator
private investigator

300
00:19:00,510 --> 00:19:04,150
hiding 128 K floppy drive in a Mac

301
00:19:04,150 --> 00:19:08,200
3 terabyte drive a hundred and sixty
nine dollars

302
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:11,880
beyond anybody's wildest imaginings
Asian a

303
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:15,490
a merger nation very important
everything

304
00:19:15,490 --> 00:19:18,650
two sons actually work yeah no

305
00:19:18,650 --> 00:19:23,220
arm everything is now digital from
pointer origin

306
00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:26,570
you don't have to keep things in you
don't have to skin things in

307
00:19:26,570 --> 00:19:30,770
everything is digital from the get-go
you george something on

308
00:19:30,770 --> 00:19:34,510
a credit card it's immediately in a
database you make a toll

309
00:19:34,510 --> 00:19:39,100
you

310
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:42,760
prob kidder

311
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:49,760
next cell phone show your future ex

312
00:19:50,270 --> 00:19:52,200
everything is cross-reference

313
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:55,200
everything is digital from the ghetto
also your

314
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:59,500
even all documents they can take a sheep
feeling scare

315
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:02,860
over my office called something called
the Fujitsu ScanSnap

316
00:20:02,860 --> 00:20:06,700
I take a hundred pieces double sided
paper put it in their press a button

317
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:10,130
walk away its key incident at OC Arsenal

318
00:20:10,130 --> 00:20:13,880
machine-readable index is a I come back

319
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:17,870
I put it the shredder it's as if it was
originally typed into the computer

320
00:20:17,870 --> 00:20:21,710
everything gets sucked in routine
cross-reference

321
00:20:21,710 --> 00:20:25,140
mister conspiracy

322
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:28,770
here all

323
00:20:28,770 --> 00:20:32,940
okay there preparing for the drones

324
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:36,230
I mean this is a perfect example

325
00:20:36,230 --> 00:20:40,970
this is an area that I found this is the
hardest you've been waiting for

326
00:20:40,970 --> 00:20:44,260
10 Meg for thirty four hundred dollars

327
00:20:44,260 --> 00:20:47,650
this used to be the routine now

328
00:20:47,650 --> 00:20:51,610
big data everything is in a database

329
00:20:51,610 --> 00:20:55,500
so the big issuers how do you manage it
by the way this is an enormous problem

330
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:58,800
for the government every time there's a
terrorist attack or every time there's

331
00:20:58,800 --> 00:20:59,490
an incident

332
00:20:59,490 --> 00:21:04,630
the US government goes and they see that
they had advance knowledge

333
00:21:04,630 --> 00:21:08,000
they had communications discussing it

334
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:13,140
they had the players in the conspiracy
recorded or surveilled

335
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:17,940
or or in a database somewhere the
problem was there's so much stuff

336
00:21:17,940 --> 00:21:21,330
they can get to it if if

337
00:21:21,330 --> 00:21:25,760
if the government tried to index
everything and analyze everything they

338
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:26,260
would need

339
00:21:26,260 --> 00:21:29,520
tens of thousands literally morals

340
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:34,520
that's a big problem so now you see
enormous advances in processing big data

341
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:38,420
where whereas

342
00:21:38,420 --> 00:21:42,490
a hundred datasets went into something
ten years ago

343
00:21:42,490 --> 00:21:46,810
now you have a million datasets going I
could tell you that the

344
00:21:46,810 --> 00:21:50,010
that that these the

345
00:21:50,010 --> 00:21:53,760
Department of Homeland Security to
informed

346
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:57,170
congress that they say every year

347
00:21:57,170 --> 00:22:00,730
2.4 trillion

348
00:22:00,730 --> 00:22:05,370
trillion offense 2.4 trillion trillion
offense

349
00:22:05,370 --> 00:22:10,570
that's just Department of Homeland
Security you have things now

350
00:22:10,570 --> 00:22:15,260
like poor man supercomputers running of
a Hadoop running of everything else

351
00:22:15,260 --> 00:22:19,740
where the processing power is amazing
now

352
00:22:19,740 --> 00:22:23,660
cell phones were gonna talk a lot about
cell phones with cell phones all the big

353
00:22:23,660 --> 00:22:24,580
game changer

354
00:22:24,580 --> 00:22:29,090
cell phones are more important than
anything else cell phones allow me

355
00:22:29,090 --> 00:22:33,010
to look into your life into your
activities second by second

356
00:22:33,010 --> 00:22:36,120
there are creating the the

357
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:40,610
private industry for strictly commercial
purposes all the issues were government

358
00:22:40,610 --> 00:22:44,200
are creating new searching and indexing
techniques

359
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:47,470
photo analysis facial recognition

360
00:22:47,470 --> 00:22:51,150
license plate readers which we're gonna
talk about video to text

361
00:22:51,150 --> 00:22:55,950
I can take a video for union and it will
send me a text saying

362
00:22:55,950 --> 00:23:00,360
car drove down the street made a left
here's the license plate without me

363
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:03,540
ever watching that video it'll tell me

364
00:23:03,540 --> 00:23:08,540
there's a meeting there's a fight
there's a romantic encounter

365
00:23:08,540 --> 00:23:12,250
all have these are things that computers
can now recognize

366
00:23:12,250 --> 00:23:16,390
Cameras Cameras re: big big big deal

367
00:23:16,390 --> 00:23:19,680
I can tell you that it is possible for
me now

368
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:23,610
to take a picture hope reminds me
although I should be filming

369
00:23:23,610 --> 00:23:28,100
I should be showing you all you're
filming me so

370
00:23:28,100 --> 00:23:31,690
no I'm sure menu okay

371
00:23:31,690 --> 00:23:34,950
I'm by the way I'm occur

372
00:23:34,950 --> 00:23:38,800
if you if you donated $75 books to the

373
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:43,370
hope WBAI fundraiser you got what are
these this is the one that's left over

374
00:23:43,370 --> 00:23:48,320
so I figured I'd play with arm I can
take a picture right now

375
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:52,090
ball take a picture this room darkness
doesn't matter

376
00:23:52,090 --> 00:23:56,220
focus doesn't matter distance doesn't
matter

377
00:23:56,220 --> 00:23:59,530
there are cameras that have sufficient
pixels

378
00:23:59,530 --> 00:24:03,240
sufficient sensitivity and sufficient

379
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:06,750
ways of taking photos wearing take a
photo

380
00:24:06,750 --> 00:24:10,860
that's across the entire focusing
spectrum across the entire exposure

381
00:24:10,860 --> 00:24:11,480
specter

382
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:14,510
that I can't after the fact a year from
now

383
00:24:14,510 --> 00:24:18,480
refocus the photo reshoot the photo
essentially

384
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:22,420
and pick Eric I in the back running
through facial recognition program and

385
00:24:22,420 --> 00:24:24,410
have his name

386
00:24:24,410 --> 00:24:29,060
you'll see that actually being done

387
00:24:29,060 --> 00:24:32,929
precision target marketing most love
this comes down to

388
00:24:32,930 --> 00:24:36,400
people wanna sell you stuff they wanna
take

389
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:39,690
the right item and Chauvet

390
00:24:39,690 --> 00:24:43,030
at the right people who are really
interested in so they want to know

391
00:24:43,030 --> 00:24:44,560
everything about you

392
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:48,230
and some other stuff that they are able
to extrapolate out

393
00:24:48,230 --> 00:24:51,560
is just amazing

394
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:55,899
the thing you need to keep in mind
during the stalking in general

395
00:24:55,900 --> 00:25:00,810
that data being gathered about you is
not be good for most love you

396
00:25:00,810 --> 00:25:05,110
is not because somebody thinks you're a
terrorist or miscreant or a bad guy

397
00:25:05,110 --> 00:25:08,710
it's not because up a security issue
it's not

398
00:25:08,710 --> 00:25:12,580
and I hate this phrase because it's
always bullshit

399
00:25:12,580 --> 00:25:15,760
when they say it's for your convenience

400
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:19,640
these three things are never true it's
because people want to make money

401
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:26,640
of your eyeballs and your credit card in
your email it's all it's all

402
00:25:27,460 --> 00:25:30,490
finally nothing is

403
00:25:30,490 --> 00:25:34,430
ever thrown away now when I went to
college

404
00:25:34,430 --> 00:25:38,120
I was I was a chemistry student I wanted
to be a doctor I was actually

405
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:42,720
god help me in a pre med program and and

406
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:46,330
every chemistry course I took they would
say this is

407
00:25:46,330 --> 00:25:49,980
so-and-so has logged this is this an
outlaw so and so does

408
00:25:49,980 --> 00:25:53,880
theorem I've decided I am going to name
some laws so

409
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:57,660
today you're going to hear about robots
for slow rum bum second law

410
00:25:57,660 --> 00:26:01,450
but here we have hoover's law nothing is

411
00:26:01,450 --> 00:26:05,020
ever thrown away there is no forgetting

412
00:26:05,020 --> 00:26:09,210
nothing ever disappears every photo
every

413
00:26:09,210 --> 00:26:13,900
drunken post every horrible Facebook
post that you make

414
00:26:13,900 --> 00:26:17,210
by the way I don't know if you heard
about this but last week

415
00:26:17,210 --> 00:26:21,160
new change in how Facebook does business
you can

416
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:24,480
there's good news and bad news as there
always is with Facebook

417
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:28,520
and the the balance is always you're
getting screwed by soccer

418
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:31,580
but no you should

419
00:26:31,580 --> 00:26:35,340
the good news is you can go in and edit
comments now

420
00:26:35,340 --> 00:26:42,280
after the time is up if you say did you
see that girl with Bob she was so fat

421
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:45,310
you could go and say did you see that
girl with Bob

422
00:26:45,310 --> 00:26:49,560
what a sweetheart more fertile or

423
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:53,260
but any body can click on

424
00:26:53,260 --> 00:26:56,650
all your changes now not only

425
00:26:56,650 --> 00:26:59,680
can you change in but the new comment

426
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:03,280
and the change is in there now a lot of
people

427
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:07,100
I mean it's a notorious former trolling
you put up some

428
00:27:07,100 --> 00:27:10,600
somebody puts on some really crazy
comment you change your

429
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:13,860
original post than they look like a
knucklehead

430
00:27:13,860 --> 00:27:18,560
arm now that can happen your original
post will be there

431
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:21,679
but but soccer Berg is so determined to
keep

432
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:25,570
everything you do you're not just your
time line but the time or if your

433
00:27:25,570 --> 00:27:26,919
comments

434
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:31,000
that all the previous iterations of the
commoner in there

435
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:36,310
but saw you heard wrong again

436
00:27:36,310 --> 00:27:39,750
and somebody takes a strange picture
never goes away

437
00:27:39,750 --> 00:27:46,750
this is my favorite what I wanna tell
you these are real

438
00:27:46,870 --> 00:27:50,290
pictures the one thing that I've been
dying to do

439
00:27:50,290 --> 00:27:55,430
and everybody asks me to do is run
facial recognition on this guy

440
00:27:55,430 --> 00:27:59,400
I don't have the heart I don't have the
whole

441
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:03,400
it is so easy to archive

442
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:07,520
every damn thing that even private
industry doesn't you're familiar with

443
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:10,300
archive .org they take every web page

444
00:28:10,300 --> 00:28:14,000
every week Graham every web page put it
in there

445
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:17,120
by the way investigators best friend
investigators basra

446
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:22,700
the biggest change the biggest biggest
biggest biggest change

447
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:26,130
his personal attitudes towards privacy

448
00:28:26,130 --> 00:28:30,150
I can tell you I wanna sell like and
hold

449
00:28:30,150 --> 00:28:36,380
guy I don't wanna say you know when I
was your age I had to walk

450
00:28:36,380 --> 00:28:41,810
10 miles through the snow without with
an acoustic coupler to

451
00:28:41,810 --> 00:28:47,490
untapped elf so you know payphone to do
my hacking you know

452
00:28:47,490 --> 00:28:53,170
arm I'm not at all the guy but I have to
tell you that when I grew up

453
00:28:53,170 --> 00:28:56,400
there was an expression damn I wouldn't
older

454
00:28:56,400 --> 00:29:01,300
that expression has disappeared there is
nothing that people don't tell

455
00:29:01,300 --> 00:29:05,410
not not and the questions why

456
00:29:05,410 --> 00:29:09,520
now a buddy of mine told me that he
heard a speech by

457
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:14,990
Corey doctor all from bada bing bada
boring whatever's

458
00:29:14,990 --> 00:29:18,580
the website is called the Boing Boing

459
00:29:18,580 --> 00:29:23,250
in Brooklyn its bada bing bada boom
point going right point blank title

460
00:29:23,250 --> 00:29:27,010
and Cory Doctorow said something very
very smart you don't realize the

461
00:29:27,010 --> 00:29:28,180
beginning and yet

462
00:29:28,180 --> 00:29:31,610
it's like smoking nobody would smoke if

463
00:29:31,610 --> 00:29:35,880
after their first cigarette they got
throw kids nope in smoke

464
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:39,380
the the the negative consequences so for

465
00:29:39,380 --> 00:29:43,250
in the future it just doesn't register
your consciousness

466
00:29:43,250 --> 00:29:48,000

557
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:32,700

network movie was about

558
00:35:32,700 --> 00:35:35,950

561
00:35:43,550 --> 00:35:47,310
that's probably should be soms is a time
tribal

562
00:35:47,310 --> 00:35:52,359
as France's huh how do you manage that
back than 4,000 people's info was like

people to submit I don't know why they
trust me Tom Fox

565
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:08,240
yes one in seven minutes sent spent on
line and one in three minutes spent on

566
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:12,830
social networking sites for Facebook
facebook subscribers

567
00:36:12,830 --> 00:36:16,970
must and they do putting the real
addresses

568
00:36:16,970 --> 00:36:20,730
ages email addresses names hobbyist case

569
00:36:20,730 --> 00:36:23,780
interests and a link to the real friends
and I gotta tell you

570
00:36:23,780 --> 00:36:27,630
knowing about your friends is important
if I know who your friends are and what

571
00:36:27,630 --> 00:36:28,360
they like

572
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:32,360
I can extrapolate to who you are and
what you do and what you like

573
00:36:32,360 --> 00:36:39,110
again but a bing bada boom Facebook

574
00:36:39,110 --> 00:36:43,010
is very very clever they have Waldorf
their section to the Internet

575
00:36:43,010 --> 00:36:46,510
if you wanna read a Microsoft document
your use

576
00:36:46,510 --> 00:36:50,250
their plugin you want to look at a
picture you can export a picture to

577
00:36:50,250 --> 00:36:50,860
somebody

578
00:36:50,860 --> 00:36:54,310
somebody has to walk about to your
Facebook page to look at that picture

579
00:36:54,310 --> 00:36:57,980
or you have to share it with them you
can go

580
00:36:57,980 --> 00:37:01,630
into Facebook they put white buttons and
open graphite

581
00:37:01,630 --> 00:37:06,100
every day a webpage other so they can
suck down your likes and dislikes

582
00:37:06,100 --> 00:37:10,150
but they don't share how work they
colonize the world

583
00:37:10,150 --> 00:37:14,660
no soccer burgers open about it all
these guys are up front about it that's

584
00:37:14,660 --> 00:37:15,859
the one thing I gotta give

585
00:37:15,860 --> 00:37:20,010
we think it's important an important
next step to talk the story of your life

586
00:37:20,010 --> 00:37:24,150
hey they have the entire story of your
life

587
00:37:24,150 --> 00:37:27,380
minute by minute by minute by minute
it's go time on

588
00:37:27,380 --> 00:37:30,470
Open Graph sucks things in from

589
00:37:30,470 --> 00:37:35,200
all the web pages out there I don't
understand the concept of like

590

maybe not for you but for me that's more
than one lifetime I would have to be

638
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:34,780
a Buddhist and be reincarnated to use 55
gallons r-ky

639
00:40:34,780 --> 00:40:38,260
and not how you thinking by the way

640
00:40:38,260 --> 00:40:41,470
this guy thought it was funny so we hit
the like button

641
00:40:41,470 --> 00:40:45,340
and he said the for Valentine's Day and

Facebook's Terms of Service

644
00:40:52,080 --> 00:40:56,080
so he didn't realize that he is now ed

645
00:40:56,080 --> 00:40:59,840
they took his picture they put it next
to the social lubricant

646
00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:05,820
I'm they said this guy likes this

647
00:41:05,820 --> 00:41:10,690
technically true

648
00:41:10,690 --> 00:41:14,560
couple weeks ago Facebook settled a
lawsuit they gave the year for half

649
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:19,110
ten million dollars and by the way a
congratulations AFF

650
00:41:19,110 --> 00:41:22,740
and be I know you can hire a good
investigator with that ten million

651
00:41:22,740 --> 00:41:23,910
dollars

652
00:41:23,910 --> 00:41:29,839
power

653
00:41:29,840 --> 00:41:34,110
they settle this lawsuit to give the
affair for bunch of money which the FF

654
00:41:34,110 --> 00:41:38,930
very much deserves arm but it's a
meeting with settlement

655
00:41:38,930 --> 00:41:42,609
they change the way the like button is
used they just moved it over

656
00:41:42,610 --> 00:41:45,890
good and it's just like by the way
they're just like the US government

657
00:41:45,890 --> 00:41:49,980
in that respect how the US government
can use bumper beepers for GPS

658
00:41:49,980 --> 00:41:53,720
so they just used the GPS on your cell
phone which by the way is

659
00:41:53,720 --> 00:41:57,190
fifty times but per bumper be brought a
car or you know

660
00:41:57,190 --> 00:42:01,320
is where the cars followed a cell phone
you know where he is

661
00:42:01,320 --> 00:42:05,900
which is the idea in the first place so

662
00:42:05,900 --> 00:42:10,870

Facebook you can see your info

now by the mall okay well we're gonna
flip through this but

710
00:45:10,290 --> 00:45:13,320
I but I usually point out to the
investigators

711
00:45:13,320 --> 00:45:16,620
you better check this information is on
your clients to

712
00:45:16,620 --> 00:45:20,580
arm of this cracks me up

713
00:45:20,580 --> 00:45:24,660
about three months ago employer started

714
00:45:24,660 --> 00:45:27,680
a practice or became known that
employees were asking for people's

715
00:45:27,680 --> 00:45:31,950
facebook password so they could look at
the Facebook profile on the side of

716
00:45:31,950 --> 00:45:33,620
their employment material

717
00:45:33,620 --> 00:45:38,170
so Facebook because they're so concerned
about your privacy

718
00:45:38,170 --> 00:45:43,500
said has a user you shouldn't be forced
to share your private information

719
00:45:43,500 --> 00:45:47,440
and communications as the friendly user

720
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:50,740
you shouldn't have to worry that your
information or communications will be

721
00:45:50,740 --> 00:45:52,920
revealed

722
00:45:52,920 --> 00:45:57,410
yeah you know how about that

723
00:45:57,410 --> 00:46:02,520
and again why why people doing this and
I tell you it's a really insidious thing

724
00:46:02,520 --> 00:46:05,880
in addition to not realizing the
cumulative effect

725
00:46:05,880 --> 00:46:09,190
it's because your friends are there when
you post something and you're likely

726
00:46:09,190 --> 00:46:11,030
masturbating monkey

727
00:46:11,030 --> 00:46:15,870
you keep throwing things up there until
you get the response you're looking for

728
00:46:15,870 --> 00:46:20,690
oval and you keep posting and then
finally somebody says

729
00:46:20,690 --> 00:46:27,690
yeah good post like had your day is for
Phil

730
00:46:31,460 --> 00:46:33,340
get a life

731
00:46:33,340 --> 00:46:37,020
please God get a life why

732
00:46:37,020 --> 00:46:40,670
I mean if you think about this in the
abstract if I came to you and I

733
00:46:40,670 --> 00:46:44,000
if I keep you ten years ago and I said a
day will come

734
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:47,590
when you will spend 125 hours

735
00:46:47,590 --> 00:46:51,920
in front of a computer talking to your
friends

736
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:55,830
a face to face but sending them stuff
online

737
00:46:55,830 --> 00:46:59,170
about what you had for pizza and

738
00:46:59,170 --> 00:47:02,990
and what book you readin whatever
without ever leaving your bedroom

739
00:47:02,990 --> 00:47:06,400
hoping for a response you too what are
you same

740
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:10,340
well think about it objectively

741
00:47:10,340 --> 00:47:14,870
now as an investigator

742
00:47:14,870 --> 00:47:18,770
I've got to tell you that who your
friends are what your friends do and

743
00:47:18,770 --> 00:47:20,140
where your friends go

744
00:47:20,140 --> 00:47:25,330
and the people around you tells me an
enormous enormous about

745
00:47:25,330 --> 00:47:29,500
that is the value your friends an
association and Twitter followers and

746
00:47:29,500 --> 00:47:30,150

772
00:49:05,290 --> 00:49:07,500
gay or not gay or black or white or

773
00:49:07,500 --> 00:49:11,020

probably a hundred people in this room

775
00:49:14,370 --> 00:49:15,560

50 that are my friends so you know

777
00:49:19,220 --> 00:49:22,440

don't care

778
00:49:22,440 --> 00:49:25,810
about gay people are gay marriage I mean
I think

779
00:49:25,810 --> 00:49:29,180
the right to be as miserable straight
people with their own

780
00:49:29,180 --> 00:49:32,600
arm I don't care I don't care

781
00:49:32,600 --> 00:49:37,510
but other people care and that's why I
mention I mention that when you put out

782
00:49:37,510 --> 00:49:38,180
there

783
00:49:38,180 --> 00:49:42,149
if you're gay or straight or black or
white or jewish urgent our democrat or

784
00:49:42,150 --> 00:49:42,940

Ameren local it out there if there
wasn't an endless amount not alert

787
00:49:49,570 --> 00:49:53,050
ideal job so I'm telling you

788
00:49:53,050 --> 00:49:56,600
that people care and you need to decide
do you want to share their personal

789
00:49:56,600 --> 00:49:57,280
information

790
00:49:57,280 --> 00:50:01,670

827
00:52:24,170 --> 00:52:30,190
captain good folks I've got your next
baby sitter for you

828
00:52:30,190 --> 00:52:33,940
I mean come on now this is true story I
spoke aka

829
00:52:33,940 --> 00:52:37,530
I spoke at cal poly tech II gave a full
day to the

830
00:52:37,530 --> 00:52:40,840
to the IT security people there
completely different spot

831
00:52:40,840 --> 00:52:43,940
not giving here believe me and

832
00:52:43,940 --> 00:52:48,280
I was told by the the head keep their
listen don't speak apps track we find

833
00:52:48,280 --> 00:52:49,260
some stuff

834
00:52:49,260 --> 00:52:54,500
related to to local people so I found
that there's a

835
00:52:54,500 --> 00:52:58,840
club with people like smoking pot go to
Cal Poly Pomona

836
00:52:58,840 --> 00:53:02,400
and get together and I put this up on
the screen

837
00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:06,180
as an example well campus police were in
the back

838
00:53:06,180 --> 00:53:09,350
taking notes all these people

839
00:53:09,350 --> 00:53:13,950
no longer serves sorry I didn't know
they were in the back but

840
00:53:13,950 --> 00:53:17,860
their moral so on me

841
00:53:17,860 --> 00:53:22,140
some of its not fun here's a woman who
lost her baby because her

842
00:53:22,140 --> 00:53:27,109
dad Peter up so badly she miscarried she
put this up on your webpage

843
00:53:27,110 --> 00:53:31,620
hear somebody I just wanna read this to
you she was so beautiful I hated it she

844
00:53:31,620 --> 00:53:34,160
walked outside at night the smoker
follower

845
00:53:34,160 --> 00:53:37,700
I wanted to get her alone after about
five minutes to being alone with her I

846
00:53:37,700 --> 00:53:40,370
walked up behind her and knocked her in
the head with a rock

847
00:53:40,370 --> 00:53:44,390
after she was honored writer buyer here
into the ditch instructor clothes off

848
00:53:44,390 --> 00:53:48,529
I don't know if this is fantasy or real
but

849
00:53:48,530 --> 00:53:52,670
again people don't have a real good
sense of humor about the sort of thing

850
00:53:52,670 --> 00:53:53,470
and

851
00:53:53,470 --> 00:53:57,950
appropriately so hear somebody talking
about k when I was 13 I was raped by a

852
00:53:57,950 --> 00:53:59,290
16-year-old

853
00:53:59,290 --> 00:54:02,450
hear somebody or sexually abused raped
as a young girl

854
00:54:02,450 --> 00:54:06,290
sexually abused by most in my life trust
me all these people can be traced back

855
00:54:06,290 --> 00:54:08,120
to their original people

856
00:54:08,120 --> 00:54:11,940
and victimized and victimize knots more

857
00:54:11,940 --> 00:54:15,960
why I don't know to much information

858
00:54:15,960 --> 00:54:19,020
flipping anonymously blippy who cares

859
00:54:19,020 --> 00:54:22,530
what you bought and how much you paid
for it whether you like it or not

860
00:54:22,530 --> 00:54:26,570
know by the way because God strikes
idiots

861
00:54:26,570 --> 00:54:30,290
this thing about God protects fools and
children abortion

862
00:54:30,290 --> 00:54:34,130
car doesn't protect foale's you get what
you deserve and these people get what

863
00:54:34,130 --> 00:54:34,940
they deserve

864
00:54:34,940 --> 00:54:38,180
would be put up there for credit card
numbers which I've

865
00:54:38,180 --> 00:54:42,330

868
00:54:50,350 --> 00:54:54,540

you have no idea how big Googlers last
year one point they had more cash on

928
00:58:55,850 --> 00:58:58,049
hand in the US government

929
00:58:58,050 --> 00:59:01,230
that's actually true they have

930
00:59:01,230 --> 00:59:04,510
on step 600 PHD's

931
00:59:04,510 --> 00:59:07,609
they have a half a million servers and
that's growing by the way

932
00:59:07,609 --> 00:59:10,620
they have developed a server aggregation
method

933
00:59:10,620 --> 00:59:14,180
where they have what's called a server
in a box it's a giant shipping crate

934
00:59:14,180 --> 00:59:17,930
with the server in there they just roll
it up on the back of a semi

935
00:59:17,930 --> 00:59:20,980
jack in the cables and they got a new
server online they

936
00:59:20,980 --> 00:59:24,510
need so many servers constantly growing
that they actually could

937
00:59:24,510 --> 00:59:28,380
truckin a server cluster like every

938
00:59:28,380 --> 00:59:32,160
nanosecond are even know they are Skynet

939

Goggles

1007
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:03,020
it's an incredible thing I can hold up
my android phone

1008
01:04:03,020 --> 01:04:06,960
or my iPhone for that matter Chris their
colonizing everywhere

1009
01:04:06,960 --> 01:04:10,700
take a shot of a building and it will
tell me

1010
01:04:10,700 --> 01:04:13,770
what famous people lived in the building
they will tell me that

1011
01:04:13,770 --> 01:04:16,970
i'm looking at the Mona Lisa I'm looking
at the Eiffel Tower

you know it will tell me what i'm
looking at

1013
01:04:20,069 --> 01:04:24,550
it will do visual recognition and tell
me it's an amazing thing Google Goggles

1014
01:04:24,550 --> 01:04:27,850
but it also tells Google a little bit
more

1015
01:04:27,850 --> 01:04:33,170
about me a little bit more my soul is
sent to the Google clout

1016
01:04:33,170 --> 01:04:37,400
and it's just and by the way I can't
even hide who I am when I'm asking you

1017
01:04:37,400 --> 01:04:41,790
Chris its myself all myself

1018
01:04:41,790 --> 01:04:44,920
and the important thing to remember
about a cell phone is

1019
01:04:44,920 --> 01:04:49,410
you don't have a shared cell phone like
you have a shared computer

1020
01:04:49,410 --> 01:04:52,560
you don't have to poor on your cell
phone

1021
01:04:52,560 --> 01:04:56,390
you don't have the law library where you
can go and borrow

1022
01:04:56,390 --> 01:05:00,370
the cell phone not if you wanna really
good smartphone

1023
01:05:00,370 --> 01:05:04,950
at a really good price you don't so
every time you use that himself on the

1024
01:05:04,950 --> 01:05:08,089
notes you

1025
01:05:08,089 --> 01:05:11,350
okay whatever you said hey I didn't hear
had

1026
01:05:11,350 --> 01:05:15,200
be shown up to the Q&A session

1027
01:05:15,200 --> 01:05:19,530
Google Goggles Google Goggles everything
that youre looking

1028
01:05:19,530 --> 01:05:23,130
now Google tracks you

1029
01:05:23,130 --> 01:05:28,440
through the normal methods through GPS
a-gps a on your cell phone

1030
01:05:28,440 --> 01:05:31,760
iTraxx you through cell tower
triangulation that

1031
01:05:31,760 --> 01:05:35,410
not enough for google couple weeks ago

1032
01:05:35,410 --> 01:05:40,790
Google patented p2p tracking up cell
phones

1033
01:05:40,790 --> 01:05:44,109
if there's a problem with tracking ball

1034
01:05:44,109 --> 01:05:47,799
but they know that Joe and Mary and Fred

1035
01:05:47,800 --> 01:05:52,190
or 40 meters 30 meters and 20 meters

1036
01:05:52,190 --> 01:05:56,230
from the cell phone they can track

1037
01:05:56,230 --> 01:05:59,400
and they know where those three so three
cell phones or

1038
01:05:59,400 --> 01:06:03,060
they know where you are Google is doing

1039
01:06:03,060 --> 01:06:07,740
and again the amazing thing about Google
is the do the hump you sure

1040
01:06:07,740 --> 01:06:11,970
it's ok I did anybody else do this
before skyhook was brilliant

1041
01:06:11,970 --> 01:06:15,980
skyhook does things relation in relation
to routers and

1042
01:06:15,980 --> 01:06:20,130
had WiFi signals and things like that
and cell towers in whatever

1043
01:06:20,130 --> 01:06:23,800
and it can pretty well identify where
you are even in an urban area

1044
01:06:23,800 --> 01:06:27,109
with a couple hundred feet even with a
GPS this is

1045
01:06:27,109 --> 01:06:30,529
reckon brilliant now

1046
01:06:30,530 --> 01:06:33,839
I'm gonna talk about this in a minute
I've talked about this at the last 30

1047
01:06:33,839 --> 01:06:34,759
percent leased

1048
01:06:34,760 --> 01:06:39,550
how there are programs like like rabbi
and other programs

1049
01:06:39,550 --> 01:06:44,500
that that background you by saying this
guy sat at this table

1050
01:06:44,500 --> 01:06:48,930
with this guy for three hours this guy
went to the movie with this girl

1051
01:06:48,930 --> 01:06:52,900
for four hours by your cell phone and
what cell phone is next to your cell

1052
01:06:52,900 --> 01:06:53,480
phone

1053
01:06:53,480 --> 01:06:57,730
and that sort of thing is that good know
by the way he can tell you want to this

1054
01:06:57,730 --> 01:07:02,910
demonstration this abortion clinic this
hospital this church this mosque

1055
01:07:02,910 --> 01:07:08,200
but this has never been done work other
cell phones are ratting out your cell

1056
01:07:08,200 --> 01:07:09,020
phone

1057
01:07:09,020 --> 01:07:13,960
not only are you reading your sofa now
but every other cell phone around you

1058
01:07:13,960 --> 01:07:17,800
is p2p reporting on where you are by the
way

1059
01:07:17,800 --> 01:07:20,839
that cluster if I am

1060
01:07:20,839 --> 01:07:24,529
an organization working with the
authorities which grew

1061
01:07:24,530 --> 01:07:28,760
show years Google is this generation's
Halliburton

1062
01:07:28,760 --> 01:07:32,250
who provides so many services to the
federal government

1063
01:07:32,250 --> 01:07:35,390
at a private law enforcement that

1064
01:07:35,390 --> 01:07:38,400
it would take me 5abi seminars to tell
you about

1065
01:07:38,400 --> 01:07:43,230
I mean you can research it yourself and
your be horrified

1066
01:07:43,230 --> 01:07:48,050
have an investigator and I'm not happy
with

1067
01:07:48,050 --> 01:07:52,470
if I wanna know who attended an Occupy
Wall Street demonstration

1068
01:07:52,470 --> 01:07:55,650
the cell phones we'll tell me about the
other cell phones

1069
01:07:55,650 --> 01:08:00,530
and I will have been one big log a
reporter who was at Occupy Wall Street

1070
01:08:00,530 --> 01:08:04,980
so that I eliminate out the reporters
phones eliminate out the law enforcement

1071
01:08:04,980 --> 01:08:05,500
phones

1072
01:08:05,500 --> 01:08:09,870
I eliminate out phones that only show up
for a brief period of time in other

1073
01:08:09,870 --> 01:08:11,540
words somebody walking down a street

1074
01:08:11,540 --> 01:08:15,359
and I every single prick and
demonstrator without

1075
01:08:15,359 --> 01:08:19,759
sending the a single intelligence agent

1076

1078
01:08:30,509 --> 01:08:35,450
every time you use a Google product you
say go ahead screw me

1079
01:08:35,450 --> 01:08:39,049
speech recognition when Google developed

1080
01:08:39,049 --> 01:08:43,469
when Google developed speech recognition

1081
01:08:43,469 --> 01:08:46,569
why did they do that because they love
you

1082
01:08:46,569 --> 01:08:50,920
when Google rolled out G or G 411

1083
01:08:50,920 --> 01:08:55,259
why did they do that because they were
upset that your pay a dollar 95 to

1084
01:08:55,259 --> 01:08:56,089
Verizon

1085

01:09:05,190 --> 01:09:08,640
they wanted millions and millions are
morons

1088
01:09:08,640 --> 01:09:12,719
to be constantly giving them feedback on
pronunciation

1089
01:09:12,719 --> 01:09:16,700
and accents and everything else so they
could get speech recognition

1090
01:09:16,700 --> 01:09:20,889
down to all level where they could turn
around and sell

1091
01:09:20,890 --> 01:09:24,120
if I have a telephone conversation

1092
01:09:24,120 --> 01:09:27,420
here's the big prop I am

1093
01:09:27,420 --> 01:09:31,819
Kevin investigate but I am a

1094
01:09:31,819 --> 01:09:37,400

1099
01:09:53,089 --> 01:09:57,030
there's tons of good Intel what do I do
about this

1100
01:09:57,030 --> 01:10:01,599
that the kernel speech recognition
protect the speech recognition

1101
01:10:01,600 --> 01:10:05,510
hype boil down to text and then I just
do

1102
01:10:05,510 --> 01:10:09,130
a simple text search they're trained
monkey can do search for

1103
01:10:09,130 --> 01:10:13,350
bomb that's the purpose of it

1104
01:10:13,350 --> 01:10:16,420
it's something that's monetize with your
help

1105
01:10:16,420 --> 01:10:20,350
you know the $10 million monkeys they
type on a typewriter and sooner or later

1106
01:10:20,350 --> 01:10:21,340
shakespeare

1107
01:10:21,340 --> 01:10:25,080
pops out well ten million monkeys horse

1108
01:10:25,080 --> 01:10:28,969
talking to Geo g4 11 and boom

1109
01:10:28,969 --> 01:10:32,800
coming out the end is the best speech
recognition program

1110
01:10:32,800 --> 01:10:37,679
that has ever existed on the plane just
so you know

1111
01:10:37,679 --> 01:10:43,030
App Inventor Google is brilliant you
can't take that away from them

1112
01:10:43,030 --> 01:10:46,420
they give you 3 app development tools

1113
01:10:46,420 --> 01:10:49,600
that is so simple to use I mean it's
like

1114
01:10:49,600 --> 01:10:55,320
hyper card for those viewers old is a
very hyper card on steroids

1115
01:10:55,320 --> 01:10:58,809
and you can make a program here's a guy

1116
01:10:58,810 --> 01:11:01,920
who would come home and

1117
01:11:01,920 --> 01:11:05,360
he couldn't fall asleep because he had
to

1118
01:11:05,360 --> 01:11:10,040
text his wife the station before his so
she could get in the core

1119
01:11:10,040 --> 01:11:13,880
and come and pick among so he wrote a
program

1120
01:11:13,880 --> 01:11:17,940
that said Android phone

1121
01:11:17,940 --> 01:11:22,700
use my location from the GPS when I hit
that station

1122
01:11:22,700 --> 01:11:26,820
send an SMS to my wife saying arriving
in 15 minutes

1123
01:11:26,820 --> 01:11:29,840
and ring my phone you get on the train

1124
01:11:29,840 --> 01:11:33,880

something useful and helpful

1128
01:11:45,460 --> 01:11:49,410
and and gives his poor show more chance
to sleep

1129
01:11:49,410 --> 01:11:52,670

01:12:33,640 --> 01:12:37,140
but it is a nightmare a real real
nightmare to be

1141
01:12:37,140 --> 01:12:41,350
able to put and app that you wrote on
your own

1142
01:12:41,350 --> 01:12:45,980
eiffel even for testing you have to get
after the opportunity have to pay the

1143
01:12:45,980 --> 01:12:46,520
$99

1144
01:12:46,520 --> 01:12:51,250
box you have to do all kinds of BS and
actually distributed publicly holy moly

1145
01:12:51,250 --> 01:12:56,020
your the probable or the Android store

so geo-location API's

1147
01:12:59,480 --> 01:13:03,980
anybody who wants to build in Google

want to keep things secret

1229
01:18:15,420 --> 01:18:19,570
an because they're aware of things like
form

1230
01:18:19,570 --> 01:18:24,269
that shot down your activities on a
server level because they're aware that

1231
01:18:24,270 --> 01:18:28,310
three weeks ago sysco decided that
they're gonna watch everything that goes

1232
01:18:28,310 --> 01:18:28,860

because they love you

1236
01:18:37,480 --> 01:18:40,889
because they want to be the only guys
that have your search information

1237
01:18:40,889 --> 01:18:44,469

1262
01:20:15,650 --> 01:20:18,970
on Google in like 2002 ten years ago

1263
01:20:18,970 --> 01:20:22,970
I said someday I'm going to see
somebody's computer

1272
01:20:54,210 --> 01:20:55,130
think is a victim

1273
01:20:55,130 --> 01:20:59,640
a really really smart local detective

1274
01:20:59,640 --> 01:21:03,500

1275
01:21:03,500 --> 01:21:07,830

because something doesn't feel right to

1276
01:21:07,830 --> 01:21:11,300

prior

1277
01:21:11,300 --> 01:21:14,750
that the Google trauma cases gunshot

he wanted to know where he could shoot
himself

1279
01:21:17,870 --> 01:21:23,070
to fake a shooting and survive he's now
on death row in Florida

1280
01:21:23,070 --> 01:21:26,950
one for a good guess here is

1281
01:21:26,950 --> 01:21:30,559
a more recent case and this is a damn
circus

1282
01:21:30,560 --> 01:21:36,260
julia Ann image the people that killed
her these two wonderful people

1283
01:21:36,260 --> 01:21:39,820
Google old a crap

1284
01:21:39,820 --> 01:21:43,230
chemicals to pass out a person making
people faint

1285
01:21:43,230 --> 01:21:47,760
way to kill people in their sleep
interesting Google term

1286
01:21:47,760 --> 01:21:51,480
how to suffocate someone in her poise
and someone the morning before

1287
01:21:51,480 --> 01:21:54,850
they are all I don't know what their
current status is but

1288
01:21:54,850 --> 01:21:59,720
I mean they're not doing well

1289
01:21:59,720 --> 01:22:06,540
thank God if you really

1290
01:22:06,540 --> 01:22:11,630
want to George a company do it the same
way you judge a person

1291
01:22:11,630 --> 01:22:16,970
by their actions now there's some BFF
guys in here I'm sure

1292
01:22:16,970 --> 01:22:20,590
they can do this better than I can
because they were involved in a lot of

1293
01:22:20,590 --> 01:22:20,910
those

1294
01:22:20,910 --> 01:22:25,400
but let's talk about summer the
obnoxious things that Google loved on

1295
01:22:25,400 --> 01:22:29,300
in which they've very assertively said

1296
01:22:29,300 --> 01:22:34,200
screw you we don't care what your Street
View books kids you too

1297
01:22:34,200 --> 01:22:37,200
misuse of trademarks busting Safari
protections

1298
01:22:37,200 --> 01:22:41,100
promoting their own products if I owned
pepsi

1299
01:22:41,100 --> 01:22:44,630
and I want to take the Edward coke

1300
01:22:44,630 --> 01:22:48,250
coca-cola I could do that and have

1301
01:22:48,250 --> 01:22:51,570
everybody right at the top with a Google
search when they search for

1302
01:22:51,570 --> 01:22:55,620
coca-cola be sent to the pepsi-cola side
so noxious

1303
01:22:55,620 --> 01:23:00,530
and its nasty in its wrong they drive up
and down the streets

1304
01:23:00,530 --> 01:23:04,509
i mean there are web sites devoted to
horrible stuff they've caught

1305
01:23:04,510 --> 01:23:07,990
people urinating on their lawn and
passed out in fighting

1306
01:23:07,990 --> 01:23:12,120
and whatever everybody's house everybody
space

1307
01:23:12,120 --> 01:23:15,840
I'm sorry its raw even private streets

1308
01:23:15,840 --> 01:23:20,390
every book copyright or not now

1309
01:23:20,390 --> 01:23:24,800
there's a funny story here for Floyd
Kevin Bankston

1310
01:23:24,800 --> 01:23:27,950
are you for or two from he may even be
at this conference are no

1311
01:23:27,950 --> 01:23:31,660
he hears about street views across the
street pupils opus

1312
01:23:31,660 --> 01:23:35,710
is a his address there is water from his
house

1313
01:23:35,710 --> 01:23:38,770
this is holy crap he contacts

1314
01:23:38,770 --> 01:23:42,350
Google releases no you can't use my
phone I said

1315
01:23:42,350 --> 01:23:46,780
yeah weekend it's the street no
expectation of privacy

1316
01:23:46,780 --> 01:23:50,759
by the way there right no expectation of
privacy take advantage is that all the

1317
01:23:50,760 --> 01:23:52,500
time taking pictures of people in public

1318
01:23:52,500 --> 01:23:55,570
here's the problem for Google

1319
01:23:55,570 --> 01:23:58,590
he's a lawyer with the FF he says

1320
01:23:58,590 --> 01:24:03,450
no probs be prepared to spend about $20
million dollars in legal fees over the

1321
01:24:03,450 --> 01:24:04,679
next two years

1322
01:24:04,680 --> 01:24:09,210
if you don't do something about this so

1323
01:24:09,210 --> 01:24:12,670
google said you know what we will blow
or everybody's face

1324
01:24:12,670 --> 01:24:15,700
but only where we figure you're gonna be
in Manhattan

1325
01:24:15,700 --> 01:24:19,610
which they didn't know people's faces
are blurred in Manhattan

1326
01:24:19,610 --> 01:24:23,690
and they still screw everybody
everywhere else including

1327
01:24:23,690 --> 01:24:27,020
possibly here no this is in the

1328
01:24:27,020 --> 01:24:32,340
safe zone who finds no privacy or
private rose

1329
01:24:32,340 --> 01:24:38,030
do not trust purse google says now to
talk about other people they go into

1330
01:24:38,030 --> 01:24:42,840
this is a big roomy guy walks into like

1331
01:24:42,840 --> 01:24:45,880
salami Bologna use convenience store

1332
01:24:45,880 --> 01:24:49,960
certs of a that was not a derogatory
comment

1333
01:24:49,960 --> 01:24:53,230
I just couldn't think the guys name harm

1334
01:24:53,230 --> 01:24:56,840
sets up a camera it starts taking
pictures

1335
01:24:56,840 --> 01:25:02,540
so no in about a year Google is going to
have millions and millions of interiors

1336
01:25:02,540 --> 01:25:06,730
why I couldn't I could tell you but
Google wants

1337
01:25:06,730 --> 01:25:10,790
everything custer Skynet google's
mission is to get

1338
01:25:10,790 --> 01:25:14,780
everything about everything in their
servers

1339
01:25:14,780 --> 01:25:18,840
who were scaring every single book
copyright no copyright

1340
01:25:18,840 --> 01:25:22,040
they don't care they don't care

1341
01:25:22,040 --> 01:25:25,040
I'm finishing up a book no

1342
01:25:25,040 --> 01:25:28,370
I've been sweating over this book and I
had to stop it for a while

1343
01:25:28,370 --> 01:25:31,390
brother sweating over this book for
six-and-a-half years

1344
01:25:31,390 --> 01:25:35,710
not a big books can be about 400 pages
it's called stealing your own adultery

1345
01:25:35,710 --> 01:25:38,800
could be on this topic but in much
greater

1346
01:25:38,800 --> 01:25:42,050
obnoxious tin foil hat detail

1347
01:25:42,050 --> 01:25:47,050
arm including a back story really great
back story involving this guy Rick taken

1348
01:25:47,050 --> 01:25:50,520
actually a lot about hope the 2008
conference

1349
01:25:50,520 --> 01:25:54,030
and 2006

1350
01:25:54,030 --> 01:25:58,030
after I being reviewed what

1351
01:25:58,030 --> 01:26:01,679
were you pointing over or

1352
01:26:01,680 --> 01:26:08,530
nod well not yet not your not yet that's
actually really interesting so I'm

1353
01:26:08,530 --> 01:26:12,980
I i want to tell you that we we we we're
gonna be trying some new technical

1354
01:26:12,980 --> 01:26:14,660
things that I

1355
01:26:14,660 --> 01:26:17,809
arm which

1356
01:26:17,810 --> 01:26:22,860
may involve things flying around the
room

1357
01:26:22,860 --> 01:26:27,059
we were going to have attacked drones

1358
01:26:27,060 --> 01:26:31,280
I do not like machine guns or predators

1359
01:26:31,280 --> 01:26:34,530
they should these nor missiles

1360
01:26:34,530 --> 01:26:38,040
but is so friggin cool like Pierre and I
have

1361
01:26:38,040 --> 01:26:42,440
dive all Kyrie on my computer that and
they're good doctor

1362
01:26:42,440 --> 01:26:45,500
I'd always going to be so obnoxious

1363
01:26:45,500 --> 01:26:50,970
the lawyers said you on your mind

1364
01:26:50,970 --> 01:26:55,980

third

1365
01:26:55,980 --> 01:26:59,110
you know what anybody who's going are

1366
01:26:59,110 --> 01:27:02,120
comeback stage or shoot in the ass with

1367
01:27:02,120 --> 01:27:07,740
love feel fine but but I need you to
like sign a release a talk to my lawyer

1368
01:27:07,740 --> 01:27:10,610
on the phone

1369
01:27:10,610 --> 01:27:13,639
we're gonna have surveillance but no

1370
01:27:13,640 --> 01:27:17,080
attendees will be heard in the use of
these drones or

1371
01:27:17,080 --> 01:27:21,070
10 not even groucho here

1372
01:27:21,070 --> 01:27:24,820
arm we should ask could see the disc

1373
01:27:24,820 --> 01:27:28,309
okay the drone will broadcast you arm

1374
01:27:28,310 --> 01:27:31,460
so anyway they just suck in every book

1375
01:27:31,460 --> 01:27:35,530
regardless of how much the guy Bourdin

1423
01:30:27,870 --> 01:30:31,590
so she pulls out and this is way way

where what's good for the goose is not

world No

1431
01:31:00,770 --> 01:31:04,750
they want to know everything about
everyone about it or not is Google

1432
01:31:04,750 --> 01:31:09,540
but Yahoo and Microsoft and and apple
and everybody else Apple has its own

1433
01:31:09,540 --> 01:31:13,580
you know advertising entry that that
sucks Taito of

1434
01:31:13,580 --> 01:31:18,580

forefront

1435
01:31:18,580 --> 01:31:23,210
up sucking down your data despite what
all the paranoid not allege that talk at

1436
01:31:23,210 --> 01:31:24,310
this type a conference

1437
01:31:24,310 --> 01:31:27,730
tell you it is not the Anna say it is
not the CIA

1438
01:31:27,730 --> 01:31:32,090
is not the FBI trust me I know how the
FBI works if they're after you have

1439
01:31:32,090 --> 01:31:33,160
nothing to fear

1440
01:31:33,160 --> 01:31:36,639
arm it years people who have

1441
01:31:36,640 --> 01:31:40,610
a profit modo and that is the

1442
01:31:40,610 --> 01:31:43,719
most ferocious frightening

1443
01:31:43,720 --> 01:31:47,170
affective motivated there is you're
worth money

1444
01:31:47,170 --> 01:31:53,270
that's why the grip your crap web
history

1445
01:31:53,270 --> 01:31:57,240
and by the way there's now a thing
called Google addiction among

1446
01:31:57,240 --> 01:32:01,460
privacy people if you go to work for a
governmental agency

1447
01:32:01,460 --> 01:32:05,100
the term for what they have to deal with
to keep your communication service

1448
01:32:05,100 --> 01:32:08,800
called Google addiction if the we knew
away from all this stuff

1449
01:32:08,800 --> 01:32:12,600
you have to set up a whole new persona
for secure communications

1450
01:32:12,600 --> 01:32:16,680
now here's what Eric Schmidt actually
said

1451
01:32:16,680 --> 01:32:21,550
we can suggest what you should do next
what you care about

1452
01:32:21,550 --> 01:32:24,730
a match in we know where you are we know
what you like

1453
01:32:24,730 --> 01:32:28,240
not only you never lonely you're never
bored

1454
01:32:28,240 --> 01:32:31,849
we suggest what you should be watching
because we know what you care about

1455
01:32:31,850 --> 01:32:35,090
a near-term future in which you don't
forget

1456
01:32:35,090 --> 01:32:39,200
anything because the computer remembers
you're never lost

1457
01:32:39,200 --> 01:32:42,720
if I look at another your messaging your
location

1458
01:32:42,720 --> 01:32:47,200
and use artificial intelligence we can
predict where you're going to be

1459
01:32:47,200 --> 01:32:50,680
which brother is absolutely true people
are so freaking boring to go

1460
01:32:50,680 --> 01:32:55,010
back and forth back same places you can
program it in there somebody go

1461
01:32:55,010 --> 01:32:56,180
somewhere new

1462
01:32:56,180 --> 01:33:01,210
it's an anomaly anomaly and it pops up
on the screen show was 14 photos are
