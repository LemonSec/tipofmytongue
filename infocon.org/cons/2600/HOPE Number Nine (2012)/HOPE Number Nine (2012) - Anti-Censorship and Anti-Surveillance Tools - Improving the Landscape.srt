1
00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:03,320
job that is trying to put a whole bunch
as our commission tools in one box to

2
00:00:03,320 --> 00:00:04,770
make it easy for people to use

3
00:00:04,770 --> 00:00:08,179
and to get the distributed as many
people as possible

4
00:00:08,179 --> 00:00:11,469
I also work with the open Internet tools
project which

5
00:00:11,469 --> 00:00:15,099
easy and relatively new initiative that
is designed to support

6
00:00:15,099 --> 00:00:18,320
all the people who are making tools in
this area because there are tons of

7
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:19,340
people who have

8
00:00:19,340 --> 00:00:22,550
started making tools in this area was
under projects that are

9
00:00:22,550 --> 00:00:25,560
getting underway and gathering steam and
we're trying to make

10
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:29,470
life easier for them as well as for the
users who are

11
00:00:29,470 --> 00:00:33,309
I'm just not run together they need
tools of this nature

12
00:00:33,309 --> 00:00:37,169
that's the kind of work do i working on
soccer freedom I work in tech freedom

13
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:41,059
working privacy and my organizational
affiliations

14
00:00:41,059 --> 00:00:45,890
ok wanna try to do with this talk

15
00:00:45,890 --> 00:00:49,430
is describe a little bit and very
briefly in the thread that word that

16
00:00:49,430 --> 00:00:50,219
we're facing

17
00:00:50,219 --> 00:00:53,550
album this is a rather sophisticated
audience are not going to get into too

18
00:00:53,550 --> 00:00:56,100
much detail here but I want to highlight
the complexity

19
00:00:56,100 --> 00:01:00,590
album the thread that we are addressing
the circumvention tools

20
00:01:00,590 --> 00:01:05,260
then they talk about how the tools we
have failed to address that threader

21
00:01:05,260 --> 00:01:08,360
right now we have tons a really good
options

22
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:12,890
I'm but no excellent options no options
that are getting widespread adoption

23
00:01:12,890 --> 00:01:17,280
I'm and change in the world for as many
people as we would like them to be

24
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:20,720
so I want to talk about the reasons why
that that that exists

25
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:23,830
and talk about solutions to these
problems and then I'm going to talk a

26
00:01:23,830 --> 00:01:24,950
little bit about what

27
00:01:24,950 --> 00:01:28,880
but my GP and Redbox and me and
hopefully my love you

28
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:32,210
are going to do to tried to chip away

29
00:01:32,210 --> 00:01:35,479
at these problems and to build solutions
piece by piece

30
00:01:35,479 --> 00:01:39,509
so the president mentioned tools is
something I think

31
00:01:39,509 --> 00:01:43,920
everybody in this audience accepts and
everybody who would attend

32
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:47,610
Commons like this is a persecuted about
censorship in about surveillance

33
00:01:47,610 --> 00:01:52,360
the sense that you understand one the
threat looks like and we understand why

34
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:57,759
people might want privacy and security
an anti-venom

35
00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:01,399
but it's worth it to go into a little to
deter

36
00:02:01,399 --> 00:02:04,579
the first thing i 10 talk about is who

37
00:02:04,579 --> 00:02:08,379
is it that you're trying to get privacy
from and security from

38
00:02:08,378 --> 00:02:12,319
we talk about circumvention tools we
talk about censorship and surveillance

39
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:16,270
the anybody's radar sensor and
surrounding us really it's not a

40
00:02:16,270 --> 00:02:18,400
government right that is me the big

41
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:21,739
the big thing that that most people
think oh the big threat that a lot of

42
00:02:21,739 --> 00:02:22,780
people are worried about

43
00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:26,610
government has the the biggest hand the
biggest best because the militants who

44
00:02:26,610 --> 00:02:27,520
harm us

45
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:32,160
and the biggest resources to discover
communication and monitor our

46
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:33,220
communication

47
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:36,709
and to take action 18 when they see what
we have our

48
00:02:36,709 --> 00:02:40,610
government censorship is probably one of
the biggest

49
00:02:40,610 --> 00:02:44,190
informational problems in water
societies not just in america

50
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:47,190
where government censorship is
relatively light my main

51
00:02:47,190 --> 00:02:50,569
but especially internationally in a lot
of countries where access information

52
00:02:50,569 --> 00:02:52,330
basic access information

53
00:02:52,330 --> 00:02:57,090
is threatened we stepped down from the
government a level

54
00:02:57,090 --> 00:03:01,319
we get to the corporate level and as a
room for a rather do you know

55
00:03:01,319 --> 00:03:06,060
privileged Americans and Europeans when
I look around this room we would be have

56
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:09,890
a lot more censorship but the corporate
level the one with the government to

57
00:03:09,890 --> 00:03:11,580
level in terms of our daily lives

58
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:15,409
means a lot of communication tools that
require us

59
00:03:15,409 --> 00:03:18,560
to you but we communicate in ways that
are acceptable

60
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:22,530
to the corporations whose tools were
using as platforms we are using

61
00:03:22,530 --> 00:03:26,150
and those big corporations entities
whose

62
00:03:26,150 --> 00:03:29,440
primary goal in life is not to foster
community

63
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:32,720
is not to foster communication but
instead to foster

64
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:36,170
profits and advertising and business
have very different needs

65
00:03:36,170 --> 00:03:39,890
then our communication does and so that
leads to censorship but things like

66
00:03:39,890 --> 00:03:43,900
pictures of women breastfeeding to
things like people trying to talk about

67
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:47,810
I'm revolution in countries where these
companies need operator

68
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:51,830
so corporate censorship is a thing that
happens very comfortable level

69
00:03:51,830 --> 00:03:56,120
two people on a daily basis in ways that
is not as having him that his government

70
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:59,220
but affects their ability to actually
communicate with their audience

71
00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:03,349
in their communities and we have our

72
00:04:03,349 --> 00:04:07,959
amor personal from censorship more
personal than a surveillance which is

73
00:04:07,959 --> 00:04:08,730
parents

74
00:04:08,730 --> 00:04:11,730
maybe if you were naked your word

75
00:04:11,730 --> 00:04:16,549
adversary in the world the privacy is
not Facebook get on facebook anything

76
00:04:16,548 --> 00:04:19,578
it's not government has nothing you do
is over any

77
00:04:19,579 --> 00:04:24,120
interest to government but everything
you do is really understand your parents

78
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:28,300
and your privacy model isn't I G and you
don't need to

79
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:32,130
protect myself from government intrusion
privacy model is and we don't want my

80
00:04:32,130 --> 00:04:33,460
mom to know what I'm doing

81
00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:37,000
that's that's good privacy looks like at
various levels Raiders

82
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:41,150
don't threaten the adversary that
worried about changes from month to

83
00:04:41,150 --> 00:04:45,120
month a different context context
especially from person to person

84
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:49,060
the consequences a privacy intrusion

85
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:54,470
I mean very as well right do within the
broader sense it's been grounded

86
00:04:54,470 --> 00:04:58,280
if you do something at work then you
should Boston no

87
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:02,570
if you say something at work the usual
Boston no you might get fired

88
00:05:02,570 --> 00:05:05,680
but if you go out the adversary chain to
someone as powerful as a

89
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:10,509
a government of

90
00:05:10,509 --> 00:05:14,389
was without my being these the concerns

91
00:05:14,389 --> 00:05:17,560
now this is a picture my Predator drone

92
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:21,460
and that's what I mean by that is the US
government we're talking about but we

93
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:23,570
all know that there are lots of
governments

94
00:05:23,570 --> 00:05:27,349
that are threatening to people and there
are lots of ways in which government

95
00:05:27,350 --> 00:05:28,740
intrusion on

96
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:33,259
your specific communication could
subject you to all kinds a brisker

97
00:05:33,259 --> 00:05:36,340
there's there so many ways in which

98
00:05:36,340 --> 00:05:41,340
the adversary model differs from person
to person from situation to situation

99
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:45,470
that kinda complexity makes it almost
impossible Preston

100
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:48,699
what tools going right for what job and
i wanna talk a little later more about

101
00:05:48,699 --> 00:05:49,900
that later

102
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:53,130
beds censorship I heard

103
00:05:53,130 --> 00:05:56,580
are really on also bear in writing and
in some instances

104
00:05:56,580 --> 00:06:00,830
its the general effect know the feeling
that you can't do what you want to do

105
00:06:00,830 --> 00:06:04,000
or in some senses

106
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,860
it is not when government takes direct
action or when corporations take direct

107
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:10,620
action that you're actually prevented
from communicating with each other

108
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:14,960
a lot of instances myself sensor we
decide not to engage in behavior

109
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:17,969
we decide not to engage in communication
because we're worried

110
00:06:17,970 --> 00:06:21,660
about what the object to that might be
and the reason worried about that

111
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:25,199
is because we never feel like we're
unmonitored everything you do

112
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:29,060
is something that we know somebody is
going to be watching

113
00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:32,419
michelin is rather innocuous rate
usually that is that has run a minor

114
00:06:32,419 --> 00:06:33,479
effects

115
00:06:33,479 --> 00:06:37,270
but how millions in some senses the moon

116
00:06:37,270 --> 00:06:42,310
the intrusion can pass em between
intrusive word may be abusive

117
00:06:42,310 --> 00:06:45,360
as well as was the case with martin
luther king who was a man who was

118
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:50,229
extremely I was rebelled and subverted
by active forces

119
00:06:50,229 --> 00:06:53,860
sodium wanna talk about our what is
happening

120
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:58,110
and while the surveillance in the world
of censorship we're talking about

121
00:06:58,110 --> 00:07:01,389
writing different on can be more worried
about her

122
00:07:01,389 --> 00:07:04,889
writer different vulnerable target
populations his partner

123
00:07:04,889 --> 00:07:09,250
stop populations for I was people who
have the wrong end

124
00:07:09,250 --> 00:07:13,349
about power dynamic people who are
powerful

125
00:07:13,349 --> 00:07:17,620
tend to have privacy people who are
knowledgeable turned have privacy

126
00:07:17,620 --> 00:07:21,880
were memorable tends not to every time
you step down

127
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:26,539
the power spectrum find a person who is
more censored less free to speak

128
00:07:26,539 --> 00:07:30,068
was free to actor

129
00:07:30,069 --> 00:07:34,120
must really be minority populations

130
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:38,139
workers right people who Mar in office
when you're not the boss

131
00:07:38,139 --> 00:07:40,919
those are the people who have to worry
about what they say at work mom know

132
00:07:40,919 --> 00:07:43,880
that my boss is going to say whatever
they want whenever they won

133
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:47,789
I don't people trapped financial
resources

134
00:07:47,789 --> 00:07:51,259
these are the kinds of people who worry
about things and again

135
00:07:51,259 --> 00:07:56,389
activists kids kids are now have the the
sort a prototypical case a people who

136
00:07:56,389 --> 00:07:58,069
have zero privacy

137
00:07:58,069 --> 00:08:01,550
and getting things done at every turn

138
00:08:01,550 --> 00:08:05,080
so income somebody's people ride you
have

139
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:07,859
not a different situations awesome
actors not surrender will target

140
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:10,590
populations lots of different kinds
above

141
00:08:10,590 --> 00:08:14,430
I've consequences that would flow from
your sense you're being

142
00:08:14,430 --> 00:08:18,449
privacy being violated and against that
backdrop

143
00:08:18,449 --> 00:08:21,639
immense complexity we have a bunch of
different projects that have sprung up

144
00:08:21,639 --> 00:08:22,699
to try to address

145
00:08:22,699 --> 00:08:27,949
specific businesses I love privacy
problems specific use cases specific

146
00:08:27,949 --> 00:08:29,360
threats

147
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:33,330
and these are just a few examples right
now but the led to a project that tries

148
00:08:33,330 --> 00:08:36,820
to make your networking as anonymous as
possible

149
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:40,200
the box which is trying to collect a
bunch of different projects and make

150
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:42,200
them easier for users access

151
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:46,459
you could've had which does directing
her to text messaging

152
00:08:46,459 --> 00:08:51,160
with the track not plugins those was
just trying to hide you

153
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:54,630
from I love the corporates remembers
that you get through cookies as you use

154
00:08:54,630 --> 00:08:55,839
the Internet

155
00:08:55,839 --> 00:08:59,120
telecom X which is actively engaged in
trying to prevent

156
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:02,170
governments a special government in the
middle east from

157
00:09:02,170 --> 00:09:06,069
doing abusive things to their own
populations and we have no

158
00:09:06,070 --> 00:09:09,440
base contraption which would which would
happen again in privacy guard

159
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:13,470
me range of responses to the privacy
thread

160
00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:17,320
is huge is extremely wide there are

161
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:21,560
more projects the injured list in in and
talk about in one session

162
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:24,630
the reason why there are so many
projects a dizzying array of products

163
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:25,519
out there

164
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:29,190
is dead the privacy threat but I
described earlier

165
00:09:29,190 --> 00:09:33,529
is as complex as I described is more
complex than I describe him

166
00:09:33,529 --> 00:09:37,589
so trying to figure our had a major
roads and I think it over many different

167
00:09:37,589 --> 00:09:39,709
projects addressing many different needs

168
00:09:39,709 --> 00:09:43,070
is one of the main problems that when
you don't have to figure out as me try

169
00:09:43,070 --> 00:09:46,320
to move this area powered

170
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:49,519
ultimately going to Lisbon every

171
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:53,399
possible need every time we try to
figure our

172
00:09:53,399 --> 00:09:57,240
how we're going to address the situation
we're going to begin with

173
00:09:57,240 --> 00:10:00,930
and situation is complex enough that is
enough different adversaries enough

174
00:10:00,930 --> 00:10:02,149
different threads

175
00:10:02,149 --> 00:10:05,110
that we're going to need a lot of
different ways to approach it is

176
00:10:05,110 --> 00:10:07,120
ultimately going to translate into

177
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:11,610
solutions that require a multitude of
tools for every user

178
00:10:11,610 --> 00:10:14,920
it would be really great if you could
just tell everybody hey installed to

179
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:16,269
work and you're done

180
00:10:16,269 --> 00:10:20,690
cuz you know towards blossom graydon
tori is being called standard in terms

181
00:10:20,690 --> 00:10:22,269
of how a project and run

182
00:10:22,269 --> 00:10:25,990
in terms of what it does in terms of how
good it is but before you ever did was

183
00:10:25,990 --> 00:10:27,970
install toward you wouldn't actually

184
00:10:27,970 --> 00:10:31,500
have privacy or security your

185
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:35,089
and I we just hang on what this talk is
really about

186
00:10:35,089 --> 00:10:39,510
by the tools don't work more about these
tools

187
00:10:39,510 --> 00:10:42,860
got so many different responses to so
many different threats

188
00:10:42,860 --> 00:10:46,100
so many ways of addressing the problems
that we face

189
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:49,290
project said a bad word on for years by

190
00:10:49,290 --> 00:10:52,880
extremely smart extremely committed
people

191
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:56,029
activists coaters trainers

192
00:10:56,029 --> 00:11:00,079
people who have dedicated their lives to
solving this problem

193
00:11:00,079 --> 00:11:03,140
and we haven't even remotely salter word
word

194
00:11:03,140 --> 00:11:07,550
we're not even close to providing
comprehensive effective security

195
00:11:07,550 --> 00:11:11,279
former even average people let alone
people under

196
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:15,810
threaten but people under you note from
specific interest by a hostile

197
00:11:15,810 --> 00:11:16,740
government

198
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:20,329
this is a really hard problem and have
not done sounded

199
00:11:20,329 --> 00:11:23,589
certainly not something on a widespread
basis

200
00:11:23,589 --> 00:11:27,459
and so I'm not a little bit about our
where are the gaps are

201
00:11:27,459 --> 00:11:31,089
between these awesome people who have
done such a good worker

202
00:11:31,089 --> 00:11:35,149
and the practical results love getting
the tools into the hands abusers in a

203
00:11:35,149 --> 00:11:36,829
way that actually doesn't security

204
00:11:36,829 --> 00:11:40,120
on items have failed us

205
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:43,930
in montana bridleways made first
mother's

206
00:11:43,930 --> 00:11:47,279
there's a sense among certain
subpopulations lead

207
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:51,439
surveillance is on president and
undefeatable

208
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:54,420
that's a hard thing to to overcome
because those are people who probably

209
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:57,110
could use tools and should use tools bud

210
00:11:57,110 --> 00:12:01,579
don't seek them out aren't willing to
take steps to protect their own privacy

211
00:12:01,579 --> 00:12:05,440
and security even if they care very much
about privacy and security

212
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:09,660
they don't actually feeling that is a
problem they can overcome our

213
00:12:09,660 --> 00:12:13,949
on those people even people who decide
they wanna take steps

214
00:12:13,950 --> 00:12:17,500
it's practically impossible to pick a
tool that will apply to your situation

215
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:20,329
without expert knowledge

216
00:12:20,329 --> 00:12:24,560
we have a lot of x-men origins: rumba
try to imagine for a moment if I'm no

217
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:29,040
is that you want privacy not quite sure
who need privacy problem

218
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:32,579
not quite sure web the network effects
are work

219
00:12:32,579 --> 00:12:36,350
the actual encryption model if anything
is you have no idea what privacy

220
00:12:36,350 --> 00:12:38,550
guarantees were getting when you get a
tool

221
00:12:38,550 --> 00:12:42,339
be because it was don't tell you and B
because if they did you probably

222
00:12:42,339 --> 00:12:44,040
wouldn't understand them

223
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:48,769
so we have never a knowledge gap but
never dependable tools that could be

224
00:12:48,769 --> 00:12:53,010
used worldwide by people miss them

225
00:12:53,010 --> 00:12:56,720
but there are you gonna find them and 11
a.m.

226
00:12:56,720 --> 00:13:00,690
as the number two rules their encounter
not a bad tools are not operated

227
00:13:00,690 --> 00:13:04,040
about that later

228
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:07,449
the fact is even people who manage to
get their hands on Tools

229
00:13:07,450 --> 00:13:11,209
find difficult to use when difficult
setup difficult to install

230
00:13:11,209 --> 00:13:15,420
difficult actually manage and using a
secure manner

231
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:18,940
we talk to users when we talk to you

232
00:13:18,940 --> 00:13:22,190
people who train users we discovered
that

233
00:13:22,190 --> 00:13:25,269
that users motivated users

234
00:13:25,269 --> 00:13:28,910
in bad circumstances who really need our
tools

235
00:13:28,910 --> 00:13:32,810
find it very difficult to engage in
effective communication

236
00:13:32,810 --> 00:13:36,829
and businesses for a lot of reasons
trade for for one problem

237
00:13:36,829 --> 00:13:43,139
tools are generally single-channel but
you take grade because the software like

238
00:13:43,139 --> 00:13:46,610
+91 names could occur software

239
00:13:46,610 --> 00:13:51,100
and it is Justin I am solution but most
of us who communicate with other people

240
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:55,240
don't communicate with them over instant
messaging

241
00:13:55,240 --> 00:14:00,070
we talk to them across multiple channels
do you mean by don't write an active we

242
00:14:00,070 --> 00:14:02,110
have conversations with other people

243
00:14:02,110 --> 00:14:05,480
we need to talk to people over multiple
channels right now that was to fit a

244
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:07,709
pattern of human communication

245
00:14:07,709 --> 00:14:12,269
and the the result on this attempt to
talk to multiple people

246
00:14:12,269 --> 00:14:16,370
means that anybody who installs anyone
channel tool

247
00:14:16,370 --> 00:14:19,410
which is to say almost all the tools out
there

248
00:14:19,410 --> 00:14:22,199
is going to have a tool that would
actually cover all their needs which

249
00:14:22,199 --> 00:14:24,040
means there's going to be home

250
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:28,069
need from multiple tools and once you
have multiple tools you have gaps

251
00:14:28,070 --> 00:14:29,860
between the tools

252
00:14:29,860 --> 00:14:32,990
and that's something that most users are
not capable of managing it something

253
00:14:32,990 --> 00:14:35,040
that most users not capable

254
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:38,800
assessing I don't understand why those
gaps are and how to use tools

255
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:40,529
effectively in security

256
00:14:40,529 --> 00:14:44,399
so tools are difficult to use the
confusing

257
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:50,339
there also a painter I don't have never
tried to use to order

258
00:14:50,339 --> 00:14:53,360
ads 10 but slow and

259
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:56,850
if you use it on your bank will stop
talking to you

260
00:14:56,850 --> 00:14:59,779
paper how will shut down your account
because you're gonna look like a person

261
00:14:59,779 --> 00:15:01,480
who was trying to subvert them

262
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:04,740
you're going to look like a bad actor
it's a even when you're trying to use

263
00:15:04,740 --> 00:15:06,920
tools and responsible way

264
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:10,800
mom there's a higher barrier

265
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:14,110
and that's a big problem for users who
just want to talk to their friends

266
00:15:14,110 --> 00:15:17,139
just a journalist who just wants to talk
to a source

267
00:15:17,139 --> 00:15:20,699
a person in a bad place he just wants to
reach out to their family

268
00:15:20,699 --> 00:15:25,360
if you have bad tools I'm sorry if you
have good tools that are hard to use

269
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:28,560
people are going to slip rubber they're
going to use them

270
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:32,550
almost all of the time and in perfect
unison the world the perfect

271
00:15:32,550 --> 00:15:33,279
surveillance

272
00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:36,880
is not much better than no dreams at all

273
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:41,019
there are several instances of people
who have used secure tools for

274
00:15:41,019 --> 00:15:47,380
almost all their communication but when
I love their communication was

275
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:52,329
recorded when Parliament on occasion was
surveilled one time the demand was

276
00:15:52,329 --> 00:15:55,560
the time that the IP address was given
up the time that the identity was given

277
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:56,320
our

278
00:15:56,320 --> 00:16:00,290
and that's a common thing that happens
more often and would like to think about

279
00:16:00,290 --> 00:16:03,300
butter if you are clumped most of the
time

280
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:07,639
and then sometimes not there's not
really a vote on a point in using it if

281
00:16:07,639 --> 00:16:08,699
you're basing

282
00:16:08,699 --> 00:16:12,000
anything that looks like a determined
adversary tell me anything that looks

283
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:12,259
like

284
00:16:12,259 --> 00:16:16,279
aim computerized adversarial

285
00:16:16,279 --> 00:16:20,360
and the final really big problem tools
is that some tools are just shoddy

286
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:24,680
of we are tools that don't work very
well

287
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:27,720
new tools that make security guarantees
that they can back up

288
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:32,480
we have tools that pretend to keep you
safe but then do things like send your

289
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:33,670
message is

290
00:16:33,670 --> 00:16:38,350
in cleartext we have tools that login
passwords

291
00:16:38,350 --> 00:16:42,290
in clear text on your systems that
anyone who looks at your computer

292
00:16:42,290 --> 00:16:45,560
is gone and is going to get access to
secure information bed

293
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:50,310
that's a big problem so we had we have
users who are facing this landscape

294
00:16:50,310 --> 00:16:53,420
this landscape but what they don't
understand and

295
00:16:53,420 --> 00:16:57,350
its it's a major headache writer soaker

296
00:16:57,350 --> 00:17:01,709
was let's dance routines one by one talk
about the very briefly

297
00:17:01,709 --> 00:17:07,089
'em and then getting to know him but we
really care about which is

298
00:17:07,089 --> 00:17:10,319
steps we can take to solve these
problems sewed

299
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:13,319
dome expect security

300
00:17:13,319 --> 00:17:17,599
people don't expect privacy they expect
their tools to support and they don't

301
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:20,270
trust me it's what they have in front of
them they don't

302
00:17:20,270 --> 00:17:23,349
expect that when they use their
computers or their phones

303
00:17:23,349 --> 00:17:26,639
that information will get shared or if
they do expect

304
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:30,679
that'd that but they're gonna get
privacy they're sorta fatalistic about

305
00:17:30,679 --> 00:17:34,049
the fact that those expectations will be
men

306
00:17:34,049 --> 00:17:37,650
a response in the security community has
very often been

307
00:17:37,650 --> 00:17:41,330
to you attend education but whenever I
look at that education

308
00:17:41,330 --> 00:17:44,730
did it looks like scaremongering to me
and

309
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:47,990
it's much it's a little bit short on
solutions right so on

310
00:17:47,990 --> 00:17:52,080
where we meetin have is a situation
where users were scared to use their

311
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:53,039
tools

312
00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:57,549
and they get lots of scary information
about how those tools are scary to use

313
00:17:57,549 --> 00:18:00,750
but the solutions are not reachable by
them

314
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:04,750
and so on the are paralyzed right they
have a situation where they can't

315
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:06,890
actually act to protect their
communication

316
00:18:06,890 --> 00:18:10,130
all they can do is choose to communicate
in securely

317
00:18:10,130 --> 00:18:14,799
or not at all and in a situation where
we are faced with not talking

318
00:18:14,799 --> 00:18:19,039
but talking in securing almost every one
of us is going to talk and securely

319
00:18:19,039 --> 00:18:21,690
because we care enough about our

320
00:18:21,690 --> 00:18:24,929
communicating with other people we
cannot let me check out other people

321
00:18:24,929 --> 00:18:28,390
lead the impulse to connect with

322
00:18:28,390 --> 00:18:32,030
our communities is too strong on

323
00:18:32,030 --> 00:18:35,460
people don't have a place where they can
go to for solutions

324
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:38,990
people don't have knowledge of what the
array love

325
00:18:38,990 --> 00:18:42,240
products out there that could help the
more the products exist

326
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:46,580
are many and they have no idea what the
use cases they have no idea member

327
00:18:46,580 --> 00:18:49,678
dude you actually bind the tools that
they need

328
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:53,480
to protect themselves if you tried to
think up in this case

329
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:57,460
imagine if you are a journalist and
senior

330
00:18:57,460 --> 00:19:01,580
what would you do to protect yourself go
to Google try to figure out what tools

331
00:19:01,580 --> 00:19:04,030
would use from a naive users point of
view

332
00:19:04,030 --> 00:19:08,289
it's incredibly difficult an example you
find options that you think are viable

333
00:19:08,289 --> 00:19:09,840
choose between the beaten

334
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:13,809
absolutely impossible with our
information that you don't have access

335
00:19:13,809 --> 00:19:14,360
to

336
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:17,390
of

337
00:19:17,390 --> 00:19:21,480
as a community we have been well too bad
about user interface design

338
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:25,230
about user experience design and I don't
I don't necessarily think that's our

339
00:19:25,230 --> 00:19:26,580
fault

340
00:19:26,580 --> 00:19:30,000
we don't have that skill in our
community and how

341
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:34,160
not have a lot of success in recruiting
that skill and everywhere I see user

342
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:35,240
experts

343
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:39,809
user experience experts talking to you
projects that are doing circumvention

344
00:19:39,809 --> 00:19:43,639
don't agree with most people into the
design process has been a major hassle

345
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:47,390
two-word we're trying to do it but we
felt that it

346
00:19:47,390 --> 00:19:51,140
and in a specific summed up getting a
good user experience design

347
00:19:51,140 --> 00:19:54,640
most projects don't have the resources
to do it they don't have the project and

348
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:57,950
they have not had a lot of success in
recruiting in

349
00:19:57,950 --> 00:20:01,250
and thats every project including my own
projects non

350
00:20:01,250 --> 00:20:04,909
I'm not saying that I am better at this
than anybody else

351
00:20:04,909 --> 00:20:08,539
really bad in stone tools a few minutes
box in stone 221

352
00:20:08,539 --> 00:20:11,590
very easy if you are not be

353
00:20:11,590 --> 00:20:16,149
i'm looking in your head dominant
majority users runs Windows

354
00:20:16,150 --> 00:20:19,950
in styling in the privacy tool

355
00:20:19,950 --> 00:20:24,809
is very hard finding the just finding
the right thing to download

356
00:20:24,809 --> 00:20:28,510
that isn't we did with malware is a
problem

357
00:20:28,510 --> 00:20:32,080
right by midnight isn't a threat to use
a problem if you need to go user

358
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:36,439
girls were stopping download it from two
cows or whatever without any sort order

359
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:41,510
authentication mechanism behind did you
have no idea what you're downloading

360
00:20:41,510 --> 00:20:44,490
and even when you download it
installment is a major hassle because

361
00:20:44,490 --> 00:20:45,510
it's usually

362
00:20:45,510 --> 00:20:48,640
you know three different libraries and
sing when and by the time you know that

363
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:50,240
you don't know how to proceed

364
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:53,400
more asking bad

365
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:56,870
that comes under construction is just as
notion no that I mentioned earlier about

366
00:20:56,870 --> 00:20:58,720
covering the gaps between tools

367
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:03,100
tools armor so difficult to use in their
wants and 700 news

368
00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:05,950
to try to cobble together by different
rules to cover all the different ways

369
00:21:05,950 --> 00:21:07,520
you communicated

370
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:11,100
is a problem that is beyond the reach of
the vast majority of tools and there's a

371
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:13,320
few projects that are trying to do this

372
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:17,320
the most measures are not successful ad
find those projects muslims are not

373
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:19,879
successful at assembling multiple tools

374
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:23,480
to cupboard their own bases to cover all
the ways they need to communicate and

375
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:24,350
connect with

376
00:21:24,350 --> 00:21:28,409
the community trying to reach in a
secure manner on

377
00:21:28,409 --> 00:21:32,980
the company's again today are tools
prevent communication

378
00:21:32,980 --> 00:21:37,710
not enabling communication what we're
doing is we're providing alternatives

379
00:21:37,710 --> 00:21:42,419
to be easy to use tools that hammer one
additional feature

380
00:21:42,419 --> 00:21:46,730
that country's security but our tools
have major costs

381
00:21:46,730 --> 00:21:51,490
and Haas company love visibility blacker
documentation

382
00:21:51,490 --> 00:21:56,700
no user suburban rounded the people you
can ask for help

383
00:21:56,700 --> 00:22:02,059
are tools are just not compelling to
most users giving users who are you dire

384
00:22:02,059 --> 00:22:03,570
circumstances where

385
00:22:03,570 --> 00:22:08,309
vector security should be compelling the
fact is that if people cannot use them

386
00:22:08,309 --> 00:22:13,408
not going to be able to deliver tools
effectively of

387
00:22:13,409 --> 00:22:16,470
I was the one about shoddy tools which
is bad

388
00:22:16,470 --> 00:22:19,620
from the user's respected it's not just
a term

389
00:22:19,620 --> 00:22:24,179
jewels from bad tools its term it was
real bad tools from sober to tools

390
00:22:24,179 --> 00:22:27,900
their products right now that are
downloading security tools from

391
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:32,809
shareware web sites and because we would
you open source model anyone down our

392
00:22:32,809 --> 00:22:35,240
code instead whatever they want in it

393
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:40,980
and you don't mind popular tools copies
a popular tools we backed was in them

394
00:22:40,980 --> 00:22:44,000
everywhere and that's a major threat

395
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:47,049
to average users and users currently
have no good way

396
00:22:47,049 --> 00:22:53,330
to distinguish between the good the bad
and the suborder

397
00:22:53,330 --> 00:22:57,330
that's the landscape that's what we're
facing were facing

398
00:22:57,330 --> 00:23:01,139
users who are difficult to reach
relatively unsophisticated

399
00:23:01,140 --> 00:23:04,659
could be better in the bases mister how
our

400
00:23:04,659 --> 00:23:08,360
the mobile tools that we can guarantee
you in some way the described in some

401
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:09,669
home

402
00:23:09,669 --> 00:23:12,950
somewhere telling them exactly what it
is when you should use it when they

403
00:23:12,950 --> 00:23:14,250
should not

404
00:23:14,250 --> 00:23:18,260
and not doing them

405
00:23:18,260 --> 00:23:22,580
but i wanna do is change the way we
construct tools

406
00:23:22,580 --> 00:23:26,899
I wanna change the way we talk about
tools and change the way home

407
00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:32,710
figure out how to deliver tools to
end-users of

408
00:23:32,710 --> 00:23:35,950
as a community on we have to have
standards

409
00:23:35,950 --> 00:23:41,179
no Conley have the way to communicate
standards we don't currently have a

410
00:23:41,179 --> 00:23:44,580
region with the same way everyone to
agree on what the minimum things were

411
00:23:44,580 --> 00:23:46,720
going to do before we push code out the
door is

412
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:51,279
with a lot of people with opinions about
this we have absolutely no way to you

413
00:23:51,279 --> 00:23:54,970
get together and of course those
opinions in the peer pressure sort of

414
00:23:54,970 --> 00:23:58,159
way the community standards normally get
enforced

415
00:23:58,159 --> 00:24:01,990
this is the thing that we've been trying
to do but there is a branch manager been

416
00:24:01,990 --> 00:24:03,529
trying to do for a long time

417
00:24:03,529 --> 00:24:06,690
we haven't were done a very good job it
because if you look around

418
00:24:06,690 --> 00:24:10,390
missing all kinds of tools released by
does yes to people

419
00:24:10,390 --> 00:24:13,490
even people who are honest I'm trying to
help

420
00:24:13,490 --> 00:24:17,390
don't need anything like a minimum
acceptable standard for quality

421
00:24:17,390 --> 00:24:20,659
and security PC Tools nod

422
00:24:20,659 --> 00:24:25,100
do not let your children just base a
good practices

423
00:24:25,100 --> 00:24:28,490
is in projects with our I would bug
trackers using projects that remains

424
00:24:28,490 --> 00:24:31,110
code that depend on proprietary back
ends

425
00:24:31,110 --> 00:24:35,600
is the project's lead don't actually
providing traditional going to provide

426
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:39,360
on we need an ethical

427
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:42,640
standard the way for people to be
convinced

428
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:46,890
dead if they are not meeting some
minimum quality guarantees in Summit

429
00:24:46,890 --> 00:24:50,330
steps but they are not actually
providing a tool that should be released

430
00:24:50,330 --> 00:24:53,699
to the public were recommended for use
by actual people

431
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:57,140
in difficult circumstances that's that's
good

432
00:24:57,140 --> 00:25:00,240
the first mister want to do to come to
you

433
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:05,360
any place where we can release tools
that we have confidence in

434
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:09,890
and the way we test the confidence is by
doing things like peer review

435
00:25:09,890 --> 00:25:13,179
peer-reviewed unions the big thing that
most tools

436
00:25:13,179 --> 00:25:18,380
are not doing it is the one thing we
could do to improve quality

437
00:25:18,380 --> 00:25:21,460
as a community that we are by and large

438
00:25:21,460 --> 00:25:24,760
not doing I talked to a bunch for
projects

439
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:28,890
a couple months ago about 20 different
projects

440
00:25:28,890 --> 00:25:32,059
and ask them why im I asked if they
would want your view

441
00:25:32,059 --> 00:25:36,230
and the answer was was in and the
silence is no I'm

442
00:25:36,230 --> 00:25:40,220
and as the money weren't of

443
00:25:40,220 --> 00:25:44,270
I got several responses the first was
dead

444
00:25:44,270 --> 00:25:48,809
the code is open source and so anyone
can look at it

445
00:25:48,809 --> 00:25:52,309
and so we don't need to subject to
define a peer review the people to look

446
00:25:52,309 --> 00:25:53,250
at it

447
00:25:53,250 --> 00:25:56,900
maidens get people to look at it because
the code is open

448
00:25:56,900 --> 00:26:01,080
and and look at any time anyone who has
a need to depend on it

449
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:05,720
can verify whatever security guarantees
with we care to make

450
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:09,390
the problem with with that attitude has
always been that the end of the day no

451
00:26:09,390 --> 00:26:11,580
one actually does look at it

452
00:26:11,580 --> 00:26:15,100
again today in people get caught up on
the website

453
00:26:15,100 --> 00:26:19,470
and say it is open you can look at it if
they're not guarantee you that somebody

454
00:26:19,470 --> 00:26:20,559
qualified

455
00:26:20,559 --> 00:26:24,010
to review it does look at it that hasn't
been reviewed

456
00:26:24,010 --> 00:26:28,590
reviewable you are not the same thing so
that that's one problem is that

457
00:26:28,590 --> 00:26:33,330
the BM that because the work we do is
open source

458
00:26:33,330 --> 00:26:36,658
that would somehow magically
automatically gets reviewed by a

459
00:26:36,659 --> 00:26:37,880
committee people

460
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:42,590
who need to rely on it so that doesn't
happen

461
00:26:42,590 --> 00:26:47,419
the second big obstacle was really hmmm

462
00:26:47,419 --> 00:26:52,799
resources but just projects are strapped
for attention strapped for cash strapped

463
00:26:52,799 --> 00:26:55,679
for labor shut for hours to write code

464
00:26:55,679 --> 00:26:58,740
most people who work on Fri soccer
projects

465
00:26:58,740 --> 00:27:03,150
me want to work on this project to make
them better and building our

466
00:27:03,150 --> 00:27:08,169
more capable but they don't spend a lot
of time doing the hard things

467
00:27:08,169 --> 00:27:11,700
born things like writing documentation

468
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:15,120
and modern code and sober mean

469
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:18,940
promising projects that don't handle
extra cycles

470
00:27:18,940 --> 00:27:22,470
don't have people who are dedicated to
doing this sort of thing that are people

471
00:27:22,470 --> 00:27:26,120
who are dedicated to doing the peer
review in the morning

472
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:29,690
need them to relax extra cycles numbers
extra cycles

473
00:27:29,690 --> 00:27:34,399
reside in people who have the requisite
skill to peer review and auditing

474
00:27:34,399 --> 00:27:38,789
so that's a that's when a major
obstacles to getting it done is dead

475
00:27:38,789 --> 00:27:41,510
even as a project and it's really
important didn't know how to go about

476
00:27:41,510 --> 00:27:42,520
getting it done

477
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:46,600
they have no money to hire someone to do
it and they have no people on staff

478
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:48,130
working toward doing in

479
00:27:48,130 --> 00:27:51,669
so they're doing the best they can to
read the best comeback and

480
00:27:51,669 --> 00:27:55,919
to be the best design make and subjected
to whatever internal review

481
00:27:55,919 --> 00:27:59,909
they can be better but they're not going
to give you

482
00:27:59,909 --> 00:28:04,370
for the simple reason but they don't
quite have the ability

483
00:28:04,370 --> 00:28:08,370
but I would like to do in transparent
view

484
00:28:08,370 --> 00:28:13,890
is to provide community-based structures
to keep you remember each other

485
00:28:13,890 --> 00:28:16,909
there are two hundred people who have
the ability to do

486
00:28:16,909 --> 00:28:20,010
this one to work within our community

487
00:28:20,010 --> 00:28:23,129
we haven't organize those people to but

488
00:28:23,130 --> 00:28:26,700
into projects on a senior basis on a
long-term basis to actually do peer

489
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:27,190
review

490
00:28:27,190 --> 00:28:30,600
we haven't tried to get those people to
do with in a manner that will

491
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:35,110
get projects turn keep your review the
project's basic education

492
00:28:35,110 --> 00:28:39,640
and simple things like threat modeling
that will teach projects had

493
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:44,549
takeover put in a repository and saying
exactly what is the expected

494
00:28:44,549 --> 00:28:47,639
need to do and ended his own and say

495
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:51,380
guarantee that it does actually do those
things

496
00:28:51,380 --> 00:28:54,770
to test it season that does those things

497
00:28:54,770 --> 00:28:58,408
we can assemble that talent we have
credibility we have people in our

498
00:28:58,409 --> 00:28:59,649
community you care

499
00:28:59,649 --> 00:29:04,510
you have the time and we want to do it
it is going to take some organization

500
00:29:04,510 --> 00:29:09,240
and I am right now looking for people
were willing to take that time with me

501
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:12,309
we're going to put some energy into
organizing

502
00:29:12,309 --> 00:29:15,340
a project to do peer review and make it
available

503
00:29:15,340 --> 00:29:19,470
to as many projects as we can from
Venezuela missed back

504
00:29:19,470 --> 00:29:22,600
by as onassis age honor to

505
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:28,220
things that people relying on a daily
basis

506
00:29:28,220 --> 00:29:32,480
the next thing that we're trying to do
within our community

507
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:36,690
is create a central place for people to
find bizarre cry said earlier that we

508
00:29:36,690 --> 00:29:39,029
don't have a reputable distributors or
software

509
00:29:39,029 --> 00:29:42,100
certainly not centralize ones but the
truth is

510
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:45,970
we can make it better make an app store
for security tools

511
00:29:45,970 --> 00:29:49,200
for circumvention tools we can be
one-stop shopping that

512
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:53,399
installs with 1-click sweet some tools
but this is not a thing that mean are

513
00:29:53,399 --> 00:29:55,270
unable to do as a community

514
00:29:55,270 --> 00:29:59,639
the reason we have never done it is that
had projects are working in silos and

515
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:02,419
projects don't have the spare cycles to
get it done

516
00:30:02,419 --> 00:30:06,720
but if we start assembling people who
are specifically tasked to do just that

517
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:10,220
do it there are several volunteers were
started pulling together

518
00:30:10,220 --> 00:30:13,809
a centralized repository up these tools
a place where

519
00:30:13,809 --> 00:30:17,610
distribute tools that we know are in
filled with malware

520
00:30:17,610 --> 00:30:21,909
that project needs volunteers that
project needs people who are going to

521
00:30:21,909 --> 00:30:22,880
help

522
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:26,240
design code and promote right

523
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:31,309
and the and App Store is a thing that
would connect up to the peer review

524
00:30:31,309 --> 00:30:35,389
because if you are running an app store
that once too connects users

525
00:30:35,390 --> 00:30:39,450
with solid tools that have a good
reputation

526
00:30:39,450 --> 00:30:43,860
users information about which problems
are those projects have gone through

527
00:30:43,860 --> 00:30:45,929
formal review

528
00:30:45,929 --> 00:30:49,559
and have been tested to reply to
specific use cases

529
00:30:49,559 --> 00:30:52,789
and you would allow users to specify
their abuse case

530
00:30:52,789 --> 00:30:56,610
and have the the App Store recommend
tools that applied to

531
00:30:56,610 --> 00:31:00,370
them possibly even in new locale

532
00:31:00,370 --> 00:31:04,309
this is rather sophisticated stuff burn
it's not actually not difficult

533
00:31:04,309 --> 00:31:08,539
right it's just some fun and we're
concerned database worker

534
00:31:08,539 --> 00:31:12,500
some users desperately needed as the
missing extender

535
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:16,899
between making good tools users actually
getting those good tools

536
00:31:16,899 --> 00:31:21,230
is providing an interface for finding
those tools

537
00:31:21,230 --> 00:31:25,570
this is the project to do that an App
Store do it

538
00:31:25,570 --> 00:31:29,250
you couple that with effective user
support in real time

539
00:31:29,250 --> 00:31:33,360
the chatter you couple that with his
retraining

540
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:37,309
you start to have a solution that can
actually get tools into people's hands

541
00:31:37,309 --> 00:31:42,049
in the years away start have a solution
that will result in both bones you solve

542
00:31:42,049 --> 00:31:43,500
their own problems

543
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:47,210
using the information that we provide

544
00:31:47,210 --> 00:31:52,450
brass aluminum zinc is really important
is required in person collaboration

545
00:31:52,450 --> 00:31:55,970
this this event hope brilliant writer

546
00:31:55,970 --> 00:32:00,360
there are other events where we get
people together to do

547
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:04,110
designer to do planning to work on the
heart problems and

548
00:32:04,110 --> 00:32:09,640
in this area I was talking to some other
people in the community about starting a

549
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:14,289
the meantime for people who want to work
on these issues in New Yorker

550
00:32:14,289 --> 00:32:17,850
if you are interested in getting
together

551
00:32:17,850 --> 00:32:21,570
to figure out how we can build an app
store to figure out how we can

552
00:32:21,570 --> 00:32:26,559
probably review establish ethical
standards and community standards

553
00:32:26,559 --> 00:32:29,918
this is how you can reach me matter

554
00:32:29,919 --> 00:32:33,679
but on the way it is in which we can't
move the ball forward right there are so

555
00:32:33,679 --> 00:32:35,070
many different ways

556
00:32:35,070 --> 00:32:38,990
which we are lacking we have so many
different opportunities

557
00:32:38,990 --> 00:32:42,519
to improve the landscape for
circumvention tools

558
00:32:42,519 --> 00:32:46,140
if you are interested in proving that
landscape there are a million things

559
00:32:46,140 --> 00:32:47,890
that we could be doing

560
00:32:47,890 --> 00:32:51,470
we're gonna start trying to get people
together in his hand on to talk about

561
00:32:51,470 --> 00:32:56,210
the specific issues on a regular basis
to the popular projects

562
00:32:56,210 --> 00:32:59,950
to establishing standards and Recreation

563
00:32:59,950 --> 00:33:04,980
effective ways to connect users with the
awesome tools we already have

564
00:33:04,980 --> 00:33:08,200
and effective ways for developers to
improve the tools

565
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:11,769
that already exist did create new tools

566
00:33:11,769 --> 00:33:15,539
so this point I'd like to talk to you
guardians find out

567
00:33:15,539 --> 00:33:19,059
where do you stand what are your
thoughts on

568
00:33:19,059 --> 00:33:23,039
what is lacking in the area affected to
making and message

569
00:33:23,039 --> 00:33:25,490
what is it that you have done that has
worked and what is it that you have done

570
00:33:25,490 --> 00:33:26,890
that hasn't worked

571
00:33:26,890 --> 00:33:33,890
thank you well

572
00:33:39,990 --> 00:33:43,960
okay don't have answers to those last
questions but I want answers

573
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:46,970
them drum

574
00:33:46,970 --> 00:33:50,429
you need them screws done

575
00:33:50,429 --> 00:33:53,529
no up but you do check number thoughts
lose

576
00:33:53,529 --> 00:33:58,179
up one of the things that has helped
with the open source in being able to

577
00:33:58,179 --> 00:34:02,019
believe that something is open source is
the existence of an organization like

578
00:34:02,019 --> 00:34:04,880
the open-source institute that certifies
open source

579
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:08,320
licenses and has a mark so

580
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:12,129
you might consider having some kind of
an organization

581
00:34:12,129 --> 00:34:17,270
that has a marker so that people can
trust that mark

582
00:34:17,270 --> 00:34:21,889
I'll another is when you're talking
about peer review book purity was a big

583
00:34:21,889 --> 00:34:23,379
thing in academic circles

584
00:34:23,379 --> 00:34:27,969
only you don't get peer review won't
necessarily for

585
00:34:27,970 --> 00:34:31,440
reviewing the kind of software that
you're talking about creating a losses

586
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:32,020
within

587
00:34:32,020 --> 00:34:36,909
near academic niche you might be able to
work through professional societies like

588
00:34:36,909 --> 00:34:38,970
IEEE urac damn

589
00:34:38,970 --> 00:34:42,230
to try to begin to change some love
those

590
00:34:42,230 --> 00:34:46,679
standards love professional service to
the community because that is

591
00:34:46,679 --> 00:34:50,230
often acted an important component I've

592
00:34:50,230 --> 00:34:54,469
our where universities are looking for
safer 10-year

593
00:34:54,470 --> 00:34:59,010
and you want to be able to say I have
participated in peer review that is

594
00:34:59,010 --> 00:35:01,550
meaningful within my professional
community

595
00:35:01,550 --> 00:35:06,000
mom so there may be another there may be
another avenue

596
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:10,349
we need more people also you may even be
able to move on

597
00:35:10,349 --> 00:35:14,500
tour got some good program where
students a sufficient ability

598
00:35:14,500 --> 00:35:18,890
can get some kind predator recognition
providing code

599
00:35:18,890 --> 00:35:22,190
in that's a great way by the way to
teach students the comment their own

600
00:35:22,190 --> 00:35:22,910
code

601
00:35:22,910 --> 00:35:26,390
yeah okay I'm and

602
00:35:26,390 --> 00:35:29,750
last comment here years what do the

603
00:35:29,750 --> 00:35:33,589
when most important things that occurred
to make a Linux

604
00:35:33,589 --> 00:35:37,450
I'll and free and open source software

605
00:35:37,450 --> 00:35:42,069
usable an example to wider audience was
establishment distributions

606
00:35:42,070 --> 00:35:46,200
distros basically you get all the pieces
together and you make them play nice and

607
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:48,800
give them to give a unified user
experience

608
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:51,970
may want to think about encouraging were
doing

609
00:35:51,970 --> 00:35:55,230
the creation what are essentially
security tools

610
00:35:55,230 --> 00:35:58,420
distros we might have would

611
00:35:58,420 --> 00:36:01,540
no whatever the name might be theirs

612
00:36:01,540 --> 00:36:05,180
there's this disturb others that is true
those that disturbed and

613
00:36:05,180 --> 00:36:09,419
instead of having to pick and choose
from an app store in its recommendations

614
00:36:09,420 --> 00:36:12,940
you might have one that's like you know
the Middle East the

615
00:36:12,940 --> 00:36:18,089
you know the Middle East you distro for
people working in

616
00:36:18,089 --> 00:36:22,540
published exterior with the highly
technical government coming down on you

617
00:36:22,540 --> 00:36:26,599
pick that element there you go we've got
all the tools nicely integrated

618
00:36:26,599 --> 00:36:29,670
try and I think those are all really
good ideas

619
00:36:29,670 --> 00:36:32,940
I'm the the App Store as it has been

620
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:36,589
currently proposed I'm by harlem's

621
00:36:36,589 --> 00:36:39,980
from the garden project includes this
notion

622
00:36:39,980 --> 00:36:43,940
love installments with some tools which
i think might amount to

623
00:36:43,940 --> 00:36:48,740
something like a distro and perhaps even
images from USB keys that you can reboot

624
00:36:48,740 --> 00:36:49,250
to

625
00:36:49,250 --> 00:36:53,800
to use but your computer in a state bed
would provide secure communication

626
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:57,290
I think I don't think that's a really
good idea and I hope that we will

627
00:36:57,290 --> 00:36:59,029
eventually get to the point where that

628
00:36:59,030 --> 00:37:03,690
becomes as easy as I think it should be
thank him

629
00:37:03,690 --> 00:37:07,490
I and so for some on the road course
work I recently had a group project with

630
00:37:07,490 --> 00:37:08,470
a Chinese

631
00:37:08,470 --> 00:37:12,260
LSAT student and I thought to be great
idea

632
00:37:12,260 --> 00:37:16,320
to teach you how do you store because I
knew you'd be going back to China soon

633
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:21,079
and I other really difficult to explain
to him why he needed

634
00:37:21,079 --> 00:37:24,240
used or Jade I would be actually pretty
easy

635
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:27,280
considering Chinese reputation with
censorship

636
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:31,720
and the only way that I could convince
him to use tor would be to say that it

637
00:37:31,720 --> 00:37:33,040
would get into Facebook

638
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:36,279
so valuable interesting and frustrating
what it takes to you

639
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:40,780
convince someone who is even as
technical as in a Mercedes doing why the

640
00:37:40,780 --> 00:37:42,820
need to care about privacy

641
00:37:42,820 --> 00:37:46,359
and uses to also my suggestion is that
you

642
00:37:46,359 --> 00:37:50,759
for project like this would have to
really focus on convincing people

643
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:54,250
either end users or even technical users
to care about the privacy and put it in

644
00:37:54,250 --> 00:37:57,369
the proper context of what it will do
even if it's as simple as

645
00:37:57,369 --> 00:38:01,300
it this will be the Facebook sure you
had to be interesting thing about

646
00:38:01,300 --> 00:38:04,890
be the use case China's after the vast
majority

647
00:38:04,890 --> 00:38:08,368
users the penalty for murder

648
00:38:08,369 --> 00:38:13,290
trying to get to CNN dot com is that
sometimes you can get there

649
00:38:13,290 --> 00:38:19,740
I'm most users in China when I talk to
Chinese activists most users who are

650
00:38:19,740 --> 00:38:23,960
saturday today just trying to get
information about the world users

651
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:28,690
we just want access and don't actually
care about privacy

652
00:38:28,690 --> 00:38:32,190
they don't feel like there are any home

653
00:38:32,190 --> 00:38:35,430
penalties to try and access that
information to you than having

654
00:38:35,430 --> 00:38:38,390
government know you're trying to access
that information

655
00:38:38,390 --> 00:38:42,328
and when I talk to people who are trying
to be made people in China

656
00:38:42,329 --> 00:38:46,940
I'm as as a broad class most the time
what they asked for

657
00:38:46,940 --> 00:38:51,140
our tools and access not tools of
anonymity were tools a privacy

658
00:38:51,140 --> 00:38:54,690
there is of course a strong subsection
no

659
00:38:54,690 --> 00:38:58,820
true activists as me think of them as
daily activists who do need anonymity

660
00:38:58,820 --> 00:38:59,940
and privacy

661
00:38:59,940 --> 00:39:02,960
but those people by and large are

662
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:07,670
are focused on a a different set of
tools that their neighbors

663
00:39:07,670 --> 00:39:12,190
and so did this goes back to demand the
real important consideration upbringing

664
00:39:12,190 --> 00:39:15,400
what is the threat model that your users
are facing

665
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:18,589
where you actually trying to get get
them I'm

666
00:39:18,589 --> 00:39:22,109
accomplish trade visited I'm worried
about my mother is a damn I went about

667
00:39:22,109 --> 00:39:24,869
my neighbors and I worried about my
government and once you know who you're

668
00:39:24,869 --> 00:39:25,790
worried about

669
00:39:25,790 --> 00:39:28,910
then you have to know what are you
worried about the doing

670
00:39:28,910 --> 00:39:32,549
when he worried about in preventing in
the case and Chinese users

671
00:39:32,550 --> 00:39:36,480
you have a few different use cases but
the vast majority of people

672
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:39,630
really just want uncensored unblocked
access

673
00:39:39,630 --> 00:39:44,240
and we can provide the tools that are
less heavyweight them to order

674
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:47,950
and a lot of people are going to be just
fine and said but the interesting about

675
00:39:47,950 --> 00:39:49,190
20 G

676
00:39:49,190 --> 00:39:52,390
a Chinese grad student how do you get to
Facebook

677
00:39:52,390 --> 00:39:55,740
is that too was actually be good tool

678
00:39:55,740 --> 00:39:58,950
but maybe not the best tool there might
be better to out there for him that

679
00:39:58,950 --> 00:40:03,040
would get him what he needs without the
penalties that come along with two yr

680
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:06,290
yeah definitely a an interesting
situation and %um

681
00:40:06,290 --> 00:40:10,569
and %um I'm going to talk and so I'm
encoder

682
00:40:10,569 --> 00:40:14,290
and but my academic background is really
you buy and Tom

683
00:40:14,290 --> 00:40:18,920
design in art really sell endured I'm
constantly frustrated by basically

684
00:40:18,920 --> 00:40:22,700
all these things that you have been
talking on I love to help but

685
00:40:22,700 --> 00:40:26,339
I'm wondering specifically like what
does bill cabbie Larry differences

686
00:40:26,339 --> 00:40:28,180
issues are around like

687
00:40:28,180 --> 00:40:32,290
as easy like or anyone else who does
consider themselves like a hacker more

688
00:40:32,290 --> 00:40:32,920
on

689
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:37,119
an artist's might wonder you know what
it is bears how do we

690
00:40:37,119 --> 00:40:40,980
start breaking down those demands so
that there's a few

691
00:40:40,980 --> 00:40:44,869
there's a few places where the breakdown
happens I'm

692
00:40:44,869 --> 00:40:50,599
one has intruded by just getting people
who have designed and US

693
00:40:50,599 --> 00:40:54,470
traps into projects the recruiting looks
a little bit different the value

694
00:40:54,470 --> 00:40:56,180
proposition with little bit different

695
00:40:56,180 --> 00:41:00,359
you try to put people in who are not
from our subculture

696
00:41:00,359 --> 00:41:04,109
I'm you're approaching people who

697
00:41:04,109 --> 00:41:07,290
are oversubscribed in terms of work
opportunities

698
00:41:07,290 --> 00:41:11,430
and turn down requests for all kinds O
previous that help is that

699
00:41:11,430 --> 00:41:16,759
every day and so you were already
present people who are trying to say no

700
00:41:16,760 --> 00:41:20,069
you sort of the first step in recruiting
is is helping

701
00:41:20,069 --> 00:41:23,099
a person understand why a this area

702
00:41:23,099 --> 00:41:27,130
is a place to buy time and energy in and
and once you can sort it could mean

703
00:41:27,130 --> 00:41:27,790
somebody that

704
00:41:27,790 --> 00:41:31,670
that this is a charitable thing to do a
lot of guys pulling the men and showing

705
00:41:31,670 --> 00:41:34,150
them how fun our world is becomes the
second step

706
00:41:34,150 --> 00:41:37,470
and typically as as hackers we we
approach people

707
00:41:37,470 --> 00:41:39,910
the other way around will be bring
people in socially and it's interesting

708
00:41:39,910 --> 00:41:41,140
because

709
00:41:41,140 --> 00:41:44,910
I'm I've seen both things work but with
a lot of

710
00:41:44,910 --> 00:41:48,790
UX people the conversation started with
how important this work is and how

711
00:41:48,790 --> 00:41:50,069
urgent is workers

712
00:41:50,069 --> 00:41:56,529
and has been rather effective Jersey
integrated makes people into projects

713
00:41:56,530 --> 00:42:00,119
that that is a hard thing to do it on
October 10 that I know how to do it

714
00:42:00,119 --> 00:42:00,810
because I have

715
00:42:00,810 --> 00:42:04,390
tried and failed several times I'm but
what has

716
00:42:04,390 --> 00:42:08,670
and i've seen. work in other projects is
finding people who

717
00:42:08,670 --> 00:42:13,390
have both works design experience but
also have some technical ability and are

718
00:42:13,390 --> 00:42:15,690
willing to engage with the technology a
little bit

719
00:42:15,690 --> 00:42:19,690
to learn it layering UN's people on top

720
00:42:19,690 --> 00:42:23,260
seems to fail more often wearing US
people on top

721
00:42:23,260 --> 00:42:27,069
I am and Reid described this as a user
product

722
00:42:27,069 --> 00:42:30,579
that needs to be engage from that
perspective

723
00:42:30,579 --> 00:42:33,800
often fails the that there is a crucial
step

724
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:39,170
in teaching the user experience person
how the product works at a technical

725
00:42:39,170 --> 00:42:39,810
level

726
00:42:39,810 --> 00:42:42,819
that enables them to translate

727
00:42:42,819 --> 00:42:46,420
that into a language that users can
understand and so there are a few tools

728
00:42:46,420 --> 00:42:47,400
that have

729
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:50,910
pretty good user interface and user
experience design

730
00:42:50,910 --> 00:42:54,899
and when I run down and try to talk to
the people who are actually doing that

731
00:42:54,900 --> 00:42:55,790
work

732
00:42:55,790 --> 00:42:59,750
people always seem to have a higher
degree of sophisticated knowledge about

733
00:42:59,750 --> 00:43:00,609
the tool

734
00:43:00,609 --> 00:43:04,950
then I've seen on other projects so that
but that seems to be kidding me but

735
00:43:04,950 --> 00:43:06,760
again I'm not going to say that I have

736
00:43:06,760 --> 00:43:13,760
answers makes all the sense thanks
thanks of

737
00:43:14,369 --> 00:43:19,040
hi so I'm in activist I spend most my
time around people who

738
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:22,880
really have no clue what they're doing
with technology and to my experience in

739
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:23,590
him serve

740
00:43:23,590 --> 00:43:27,700
the tools that activists need is like
first and foremost

741
00:43:27,700 --> 00:43:31,770
need to actually understand the
technology they're using before they can

742
00:43:31,770 --> 00:43:32,920
even get to the point

743
00:43:32,920 --> 00:43:36,340
have being able to use it securely

744
00:43:36,340 --> 00:43:39,660
and ending did very very frequently with
the latter

745
00:43:39,660 --> 00:43:44,470
tools even if we tell them how to use it
there's no chance they're going to be

746
00:43:44,470 --> 00:43:48,910
able to because they just don't get it I
mean I think a good example is you

747
00:43:48,910 --> 00:43:53,069
mentioned that I'd is lying on these
tools in winners can be cumbersome in a

748
00:43:53,070 --> 00:43:53,920
long process

749
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:57,780
but even more than that it's freaking
going to be the first time that many of

750
00:43:57,780 --> 00:44:00,050
these people have tried to do anything
like it

751
00:44:00,050 --> 00:44:03,270
so they have no idea if it worked really

752
00:44:03,270 --> 00:44:08,020
and if it didn't work they have no clue
where it failed because it is completely

753
00:44:08,020 --> 00:44:09,720
outside of their experience

754
00:44:09,720 --> 00:44:13,210
so I guess and is there any kind

755
00:44:13,210 --> 00:44:19,150
effort to do education supporting the
straws that's really much much more

756
00:44:19,150 --> 00:44:23,070
basic education to get people up to that
point so

757
00:44:23,070 --> 00:44:27,800
some projects I really good at providing
them

758
00:44:27,800 --> 00:44:32,010
user support you been in real time is
your support

759
00:44:32,010 --> 00:44:37,170
unfortunately a lot and that takes the
form of chat through IRC which is not a

760
00:44:37,170 --> 00:44:37,859
thing that

761
00:44:37,859 --> 00:44:41,130
most windows can get to so

762
00:44:41,130 --> 00:44:45,030
you know when those users dad never use
IRC by and large that's a that's a

763
00:44:45,030 --> 00:44:46,550
problem maybe we have a gap

764
00:44:46,550 --> 00:44:49,660
user support I I don't

765
00:44:49,660 --> 00:44:53,618
know how to close that gap except to say
that we need to

766
00:44:53,619 --> 00:44:57,740
recruit people whose job it is to just
close that gap

767
00:44:57,740 --> 00:45:01,130
but does not get this going to be closed
by developers that's a gap that is going

768
00:45:01,130 --> 00:45:04,000
to be closed by other people associated
with projects

769
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:07,990
that decide that it's their mission to
close that gap and

770
00:45:07,990 --> 00:45:11,750
using projects that someone have good
documentation

771
00:45:11,750 --> 00:45:15,040
but they're not doing what you're
describing but they're not describing

772
00:45:15,040 --> 00:45:17,990
all the different ways it could fail in
all their responses to those failures

773
00:45:17,990 --> 00:45:21,390
and ways to gain more information about
it and then overcome those failures

774
00:45:21,390 --> 00:45:26,759
because that's the thing that we don't
tender document on almost any projects

775
00:45:26,760 --> 00:45:27,150
less

776
00:45:27,150 --> 00:45:31,420
that those are does our problems again I
do not have solutions to those problems

777
00:45:31,420 --> 00:45:35,260
in there are people who 12 truman

778
00:45:35,260 --> 00:45:39,570
a real time chat support mechanism

779
00:45:39,570 --> 00:45:43,060
you know might be based on IRC but
doesn't require anybody to download an

780
00:45:43,060 --> 00:45:44,230
IRC client

781
00:45:44,230 --> 00:45:47,880
then we got the start of something but
until then

782
00:45:47,880 --> 00:45:51,480
we're gonna have lotsa people fell out
at the insulation level but again that's

783
00:45:51,480 --> 00:45:52,020
gonna be

784
00:45:52,020 --> 00:45:56,520
be a shame 21 response to this problem
has been

785
00:45:56,520 --> 00:46:01,820
live CDs USB keys that you can reboot
and everything's all installed for you

786
00:46:01,820 --> 00:46:05,070
and if you can convince people that it
is

787
00:46:05,070 --> 00:46:08,510
was removing their computers you have
secure communication

788
00:46:08,510 --> 00:46:12,130
you can skip over all the installation
steps now there are massive problems

789
00:46:12,130 --> 00:46:15,070
with usability associated with taking
users enter their own environment

790
00:46:15,070 --> 00:46:16,910
sticking them into a new one

791
00:46:16,910 --> 00:46:20,368
and leave behind all their data and
other known applications

792
00:46:20,369 --> 00:46:24,670
but you can solve that problem so the
the approach really

793
00:46:24,670 --> 00:46:28,010
is is to do this other thing which I
don't actually think

794
00:46:28,010 --> 00:46:34,010
is always the best approach thank you of

795
00:46:34,010 --> 00:46:37,020
in so you are part of the the freedom
box

796
00:46:37,020 --> 00:46:40,930
under your involved as well %um I mean
what what are the

797
00:46:40,930 --> 00:46:45,180
possibilities having a privacy box right
to me or something that specifically

798
00:46:45,180 --> 00:46:49,029
a I mean my I can see my grandmother
right like she's not gonna

799
00:46:49,030 --> 00:46:52,400
take a CD she's not gonna install
something much a plug something in

800
00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:55,700
so what you know what possibilities
revolve around

801
00:46:55,700 --> 00:46:59,930
that having you know you can even have
particular devices for particular types

802
00:46:59,930 --> 00:47:02,140
a threat levels are particular areas

803
00:47:02,140 --> 00:47:05,339
cetera et cetera yeah %uh the problem
with that is that it's

804
00:47:05,339 --> 00:47:09,759
really really hard to do that in a
effective and comprehensive

805
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:14,500
way privacy means so many different
things to so many people:

806
00:47:14,500 --> 00:47:17,740
lead differed from me to magically into
it

807
00:47:17,740 --> 00:47:21,510
what privacy means in terms over your
family member

808
00:47:21,510 --> 00:47:24,810
who you can magically see I'm

809
00:47:24,810 --> 00:47:30,500
I don't know how we do that great so the
best we can do is read have described

810
00:47:30,500 --> 00:47:34,330
ways in which people might want privacy
and then provide mechanisms they can get

811
00:47:34,330 --> 00:47:34,880
it

812
00:47:34,880 --> 00:47:39,000
and the number permutations you can get
out of that to stick them in one place

813
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:40,250
and have somebody

814
00:47:40,250 --> 00:47:44,230
say I just plug this in I have privacy
that I don't think we're ever going to

815
00:47:44,230 --> 00:47:46,160
get there I think we're always going to
have

816
00:47:46,160 --> 00:47:49,890
some branching that's going to need to
get done in order to provide people with

817
00:47:49,890 --> 00:47:52,279
stuff that we could be considered by
Dennis by

818
00:47:52,280 --> 00:47:55,350
a universal subset and try to provide
that but

819
00:47:55,350 --> 00:47:59,330
I don't think they're quite gets us
there well in terms of let's let's let's

820
00:47:59,330 --> 00:48:01,440
bring down one audience then let's say
that

821
00:48:01,440 --> 00:48:05,220
the completely non-technical person who
will never do anything

822
00:48:05,220 --> 00:48:08,390
to their computer right the person is
never gonna install anything and

823
00:48:08,390 --> 00:48:11,200
everything else what do you do for that
subset which

824
00:48:11,200 --> 00:48:14,570
is does all the people who were gonna
get taken off you know

825
00:48:14,570 --> 00:48:18,290
but the DNS Changer think those are the
people were gonna have zombie

826
00:48:18,290 --> 00:48:21,700
PCs are the people who in all they do is
turn on/off

827
00:48:21,700 --> 00:48:25,060
like thats that's a big subset of people
who are at the

828
00:48:25,060 --> 00:48:29,270
the back into the bell curve technology
adoption so can we do something to solve

829
00:48:29,270 --> 00:48:30,310
thats

830
00:48:30,310 --> 00:48:34,400
problem yeah I mean that i think thats

831
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:37,880
those are the people that freedom box is
aimed at to some degree

832
00:48:37,880 --> 00:48:42,140
album the closer we look at it every
time we go back a layer

833
00:48:42,140 --> 00:48:45,600
we we discovered five more branches and
more complexity

834
00:48:45,600 --> 00:48:50,609
it's it's a very hard problem we r
trying to

835
00:48:50,609 --> 00:48:55,420
chip on pieces of functionality one by
one input privacy and security

836
00:48:55,420 --> 00:48:58,869
pieces in place right so weekend %uh

837
00:48:58,869 --> 00:49:04,320
provide a transparent HTTP and HTTPS
proxy that will do things like remove

838
00:49:04,320 --> 00:49:05,720
tracking cookies we can

839
00:49:05,720 --> 00:49:09,859
we could do that we can try to a greater
connection SSL wherever possible

840
00:49:09,859 --> 00:49:13,000
so we can ship of these individual
pieces but

841
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:16,100
what's wanna be interesting things is
that the

842
00:49:16,100 --> 00:49:19,700
without access to our computers there's
only so much that

843
00:49:19,700 --> 00:49:23,200
intermediary servers can do so for
example

844
00:49:23,200 --> 00:49:27,970
it would be really great if a privacy
box or freedom box could

845
00:49:27,970 --> 00:49:32,570
munger browser fingerprint Brady was not
have to click where

846
00:49:32,570 --> 00:49:36,060
we can you not be identified your
computer by its characteristics by once

847
00:49:36,060 --> 00:49:37,420
installed on it the parts

848
00:49:37,420 --> 00:49:41,280
and that the plugins and that stuff

849
00:49:41,280 --> 00:49:44,400
you know you gotta yet that and look at
him not to click

850
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:48,200
you discover that your browser is
relatively unique down to one or two

851
00:49:48,200 --> 00:49:50,180
other browsers in the world probably

852
00:49:50,180 --> 00:49:54,799
ok I am i sat down I try to figure out
how little

853
00:49:54,800 --> 00:49:58,550
the freedom boxwood change your browser
fingerprint

854
00:49:58,550 --> 00:50:02,080
try to make you look like other boxes on
the Internet and it turns out that all

855
00:50:02,080 --> 00:50:05,450
that stuff happens in the browser does
not serve the passes through the HTTP

856
00:50:05,450 --> 00:50:07,430
streaming right is it's your flash

857
00:50:07,430 --> 00:50:10,770
as giving you up and if somebody

858
00:50:10,770 --> 00:50:15,069
had something over SSL intermediary
servers never have a chance to get in

859
00:50:15,069 --> 00:50:19,000
there and say no don't do this ugly
flash them

860
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:21,810
so there's only so much we can do it
we're gonna provide protection for

861
00:50:21,810 --> 00:50:23,710
engineer users wherever we can but

862
00:50:23,710 --> 00:50:27,160
its it's going to be really tough if
people have

863
00:50:27,160 --> 00:50:30,480
good ideas as to what that subset is it
has its limitations that will do it we

864
00:50:30,480 --> 00:50:32,410
will we will stand on a box and

865
00:50:32,410 --> 00:50:35,750
distribute everyone we can but yeah
that's that's definitely the approach

866
00:50:35,750 --> 00:50:39,010
having a simple plugin thing that
anybody can use that is

867
00:50:39,010 --> 00:50:42,970
the thing that we would like more than
anything else in the world

868
00:50:42,970 --> 00:50:46,830
thank you so I'm I'm at a time

869
00:50:46,830 --> 00:50:51,089
and I want to thank everybody for
listening and for the great comments

870
00:50:51,089 --> 00:50:54,490
and I hope that someone will contact me
afterwards at their ways we can work

871
00:50:54,490 --> 00:50:55,089
together

872
00:50:55,089 --> 00:50:55,339
thank you
