1
00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:03,820
I'm glad I'll I love you decided to

2
00:00:03,820 --> 00:00:06,870
to come here on a Friday night

3
00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:10,650
to you listen to me talk about what I'm
calling

4
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:13,769
I printable electronics and the future
%uh

5
00:00:13,769 --> 00:00:16,970
so they're open hardware I and you know
that the

6
00:00:16,970 --> 00:00:20,849
than the subtitle the talk is how to
prints

7
00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:23,890
I southerner between because that's the
question

8
00:00:23,890 --> 00:00:27,400
everyone always asks and thats really
what everybody wants to now

9
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:30,939
so first persist a few

10
00:00:30,939 --> 00:00:34,559
things about me I have what I will call
eight distinct

11
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:38,780
speaking style which is code for I A
have a stutter

12
00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:42,629
so I may take a little while longer to
say some things I'm a stump on some

13
00:00:42,629 --> 00:00:43,180
words

14
00:00:43,180 --> 00:00:47,530
but I we can all get we can all get

15
00:00:47,530 --> 00:00:50,660
3s I'm a fifty-year

16
00:00:50,660 --> 00:00:54,289
EP HTC been up at up at columbia a

17
00:00:54,289 --> 00:00:58,140
University I my labs kinda president
hardware hacker

18
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:01,809
which is why I'm still a fifth year PhD
student haven't graduated yet

19
00:01:01,809 --> 00:01:04,949
Amanda fine fact about myself

20
00:01:04,949 --> 00:01:08,039
I hung jars um

21
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:11,700
yes just a little bit about I am I

22
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:15,100
so by my lab it is called clue it is the

23
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:18,590
Columbia laboratory for unconventional
electronics

24
00:01:18,590 --> 00:01:22,640
arm so the team overlap is novel or

25
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:26,439
integration I love I love all these

26
00:01:26,439 --> 00:01:30,689
I'm kinda different I technologies to
build new

27
00:01:30,689 --> 00:01:34,460
and call I'm systems we have a very

28
00:01:34,460 --> 00:01:38,460
entrepreneurial emphasis in the lab we
have 3e

29
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:41,470
startups coming out lab arm which is
something we can

30
00:01:41,470 --> 00:01:45,500
weekend you talk about later at
something else I want to mention is that

31
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:47,170
we're always looking for new students

32
00:01:47,170 --> 00:01:48,900
and new

33
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:51,619
and new collaborators

34
00:01:51,619 --> 00:01:55,100
we have a buncha we have mucho really
cool

35
00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:58,860
arm really cool tools that we have a
blob that

36
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:03,539
that we would be: you know happy to
share um

37
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:07,159
you know so us all so I just got there
some the slight really

38
00:02:07,159 --> 00:02:10,500
quick to give you kinda an overview of
some the project that we do

39
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:14,170
um this is my main project right now the
these are

40
00:02:14,170 --> 00:02:17,340
these are energy harvesting active

41
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:20,880
network tags: these are like smart

42
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:24,079
RFID tags that are able to harvest I

43
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:30,660
arm harvests energy I from their
environment and they form a

44
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:35,510
for May a you wireless mesh network so
they can be

45
00:02:35,510 --> 00:02:38,600
and the backbone the Internet of Things
and

46
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:42,209
really all about this is all this is
possible because we are

47
00:02:42,209 --> 00:02:47,319
bring together all these I kinda
disparate technologies into a single

48
00:02:47,319 --> 00:02:47,980
package

49
00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:51,060
I this is want the startups

50
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:54,930
that that we're working on this is where
I am going to be

51
00:02:54,930 --> 00:02:58,079
working starting in the fall arm this

52
00:02:58,079 --> 00:03:02,000
is the this is the technology that is
going to

53
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,030
some that is going to make

54
00:03:05,030 --> 00:03:08,870
wearable heads-up displays brights

55
00:03:08,870 --> 00:03:12,350
hombre any fish in so I

56
00:03:12,350 --> 00:03:16,190
so I hope is an hoping maybe the next
two or three years you'll see this

57
00:03:16,190 --> 00:03:20,079
I you will see this kind of technology
something Google glass

58
00:03:20,079 --> 00:03:23,370
file devices arm

59
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:27,000
how actually got started into certain
this whole

60
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,220
open hardware printable electronics area
is

61
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:34,950
on so we teach a course at course at
Club be called modern display science

62
00:03:34,950 --> 00:03:38,329
and technology and it's all about I the

63
00:03:38,329 --> 00:03:42,299
p.m. glowing rectangles we all spend so
much every day

64
00:03:42,299 --> 00:03:45,400
staring at arm we

65
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:49,680
I we have a series the I'm series lab
exercises there

66
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:53,209
and we are now in the process out to
bring those

67
00:03:53,209 --> 00:03:56,930
into cats their a debt that will let
anyone build their own

68
00:03:56,930 --> 00:04:00,350
kinda its place at home and

69
00:04:00,350 --> 00:04:03,790
on ands some taking this

70
00:04:03,790 --> 00:04:07,480
to the next level up some the project
I've been working on

71
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:10,919
I when I was an internets I

72
00:04:10,919 --> 00:04:14,250
ads Microsoft's in research

73
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:18,298
was I was booking in ways that you can

74
00:04:18,298 --> 00:04:21,690
combined the 3d printing

75
00:04:21,690 --> 00:04:25,590
rapid prototyping I technology

76
00:04:25,590 --> 00:04:30,110
with these new printable electronics

77
00:04:30,110 --> 00:04:33,270
arm so you can I'm so you

78
00:04:33,270 --> 00:04:36,919
I say to make a new classify objects in
your 3d printer

79
00:04:36,919 --> 00:04:40,109
by I but

80
00:04:40,110 --> 00:04:44,139
but I think what I learned from that
experience is is there still one key

81
00:04:44,139 --> 00:04:44,900
component

82
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:48,460
um that's missing from all that I am

83
00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:52,049
and you know so I wanna talk about these

84
00:04:52,050 --> 00:04:55,970
three things here too to show

85
00:04:55,970 --> 00:04:59,430
how you really need on need to have

86
00:04:59,430 --> 00:05:03,370
3d printing arm under venture
electronics

87
00:05:03,370 --> 00:05:07,290
I and and kind missing piece I'll

88
00:05:07,290 --> 00:05:10,389
on gets I'll open source hardware

89
00:05:10,389 --> 00:05:13,790
that is going to make this all possible
just

90
00:05:13,790 --> 00:05:17,860
overview arm I how many have you

91
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:22,750
were were here for the talks this
morning about

92
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:26,539
about unison up its hardware I

93
00:05:26,539 --> 00:05:30,560
have you you know what open source open
source hardware is

94
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:34,110
so it's a pretty pretty

95
00:05:34,110 --> 00:05:37,810
self-explanatory thing it is the open
source software principles

96
00:05:37,810 --> 00:05:41,639
I and it is just applied to

97
00:05:41,639 --> 00:05:45,620
but the hardware if on if you want to
learn more about it

98
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:49,689
Sep September 27th here in New York City
is the oppenheimer summit

99
00:05:49,689 --> 00:05:53,580
she definitely come check it out there
are

100
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:57,330
a by the people doing some doing some
really interesting

101
00:05:57,330 --> 00:06:01,270
I'm stuff an open-source hardware I just
have to three

102
00:06:01,270 --> 00:06:05,680
I New York city-based companies here
just in case there's anyone

103
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:09,789
from the audience companies and

104
00:06:09,789 --> 00:06:13,259
I yes I just wanna 10

105
00:06:13,259 --> 00:06:17,439
say a say why I think open source

106
00:06:17,439 --> 00:06:22,129
hardware I is important is

107
00:06:22,129 --> 00:06:26,330
arm so it's essentially if you can't if
you can

108
00:06:26,330 --> 00:06:29,680
actual printer hardware you down you
don't really

109
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:32,900
you don't really own year %uh on your
hardware

110
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:36,469
and I think that's a very important
cultural point to make

111
00:06:36,469 --> 00:06:39,919
alright 3d printing

112
00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:44,020
who knows what who knows why 3d printing
is

113
00:06:44,020 --> 00:06:49,650
pretty much everyone I am if you don't
know what it is you can go down stairs

114
00:06:49,650 --> 00:06:50,889
to the second floor

115
00:06:50,889 --> 00:06:54,810
you know up stop bus stop by to make
about table and they can

116
00:06:54,810 --> 00:06:58,060
I show you how it works but arm

117
00:06:58,060 --> 00:07:02,289
so they have the maker but works is
shown on the left where you have

118
00:07:02,289 --> 00:07:05,469
a where you have a plastic filament

119
00:07:05,469 --> 00:07:09,550
and it just moves along I'm spinning out
the plastic and it doesn't things layer

120
00:07:09,550 --> 00:07:10,300
by layer

121
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:14,469
on and there's a new I knew very
exciting

122
00:07:14,469 --> 00:07:19,020
I am technology coming to the DIY 3d
printing seen

123
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:22,758
which is this I stereo photography base
and I

124
00:07:22,759 --> 00:07:27,909
UV terrible present I

125
00:07:27,909 --> 00:07:31,169
say you have a bad up the rest and then
you have a light source

126
00:07:31,169 --> 00:07:34,430
and you're able able I

127
00:07:34,430 --> 00:07:38,819
to expose lights I to expose a residence
light source to get the

128
00:07:38,819 --> 00:07:43,880
which I some examples of us and the
really cool things you can do with 3d

129
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:44,690
printing you can do

130
00:07:44,690 --> 00:07:48,089
large-scale things like I like the body
of the car you can do

131
00:07:48,089 --> 00:07:50,850
small-scale things like the

132
00:07:50,850 --> 00:07:54,120
nanoscale church you can do food you can

133
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:57,600
a unity the do they can blood vessels
you can

134
00:07:57,600 --> 00:08:01,360
you can you close you can do you can do

135
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:05,230
high ProjeX you can do a whole bunch for
the cost

136
00:08:05,230 --> 00:08:08,870
and this has a lot of people

137
00:08:08,870 --> 00:08:12,410
really in really excited they are saying

138
00:08:12,410 --> 00:08:15,550
3d printing it is going to change the
world

139
00:08:15,550 --> 00:08:20,420
and yes certainly it does have the
potential to

140
00:08:20,420 --> 00:08:23,870
to change the world by I by

141
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:28,100
there there there are still some Chi
kind of elements

142
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:31,660
missing from the current 3d printing
landscape

143
00:08:31,660 --> 00:08:35,440
I am sense if you look at most the stuff
you can print

144
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:38,880
arm I am so it's what I would call

145
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:43,030
structural objects you know now the two
functional

146
00:08:43,030 --> 00:08:47,230
hot checks you know so you can us so you
can have

147
00:08:47,230 --> 00:08:51,520
class again in shape you know that you
want but it but if you want something

148
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:52,199
else

149
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:55,700
I that may or may not be

150
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:59,330
possible so arm

151
00:08:59,330 --> 00:09:02,460
so I am I am proposing that

152
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:06,350
proposing that the II solution to this
problem

153
00:09:06,350 --> 00:09:09,440
are unconventional trucks arm

154
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:13,290
what I'm calling unconventional the
Tronix our chests

155
00:09:13,290 --> 00:09:17,060
are are just any type type

156
00:09:17,060 --> 00:09:21,630
electronics that are not silicon-based
arm so if you look at the

157
00:09:21,630 --> 00:09:25,189
kind of standard silken so tall arm

158
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:29,310
all about about making things smaller a
smaller

159
00:09:29,310 --> 00:09:32,570
hands smaller and pastors

160
00:09:32,570 --> 00:09:37,050
secure following Moore's law so you can
cram more transistors

161
00:09:37,050 --> 00:09:40,350
on a really small space by you can

162
00:09:40,350 --> 00:09:43,550
its certainly imagine some applications
where

163
00:09:43,550 --> 00:09:47,420
where you may 1 large area electronics
you may 14

164
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:50,490
electronic structure electronics you may
want to

165
00:09:50,490 --> 00:09:53,910
have something that you could print out
on

166
00:09:53,910 --> 00:09:57,719
on sheet paper and that's just not going
to be possible using

167
00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:03,190
the conventional soaking electronics I
am so

168
00:10:03,190 --> 00:10:07,650
so some sample uva a I you know which
can even do now

169
00:10:07,650 --> 00:10:11,209
with these interventions China X you can
you can

170
00:10:11,210 --> 00:10:14,830
I have a sore so on the right you can
have a display

171
00:10:14,830 --> 00:10:18,690
you can have a battery you can even do

172
00:10:18,690 --> 00:10:21,760
a whole bunch exotic kinda materials I

173
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:25,260
and then the top left's that is actually

174
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:29,790
a completes microprocessor

175
00:10:29,790 --> 00:10:34,530
which is made using organic transistors

176
00:10:34,530 --> 00:10:38,620
so it's a such a really promising
technology

177
00:10:38,620 --> 00:10:42,480
and see can certainly see how

178
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:46,440
hell if you have printable electronics

179
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:49,830
day you able to you are able to

180
00:10:49,830 --> 00:10:54,030
printout on your own that it is really
going to change the way

181
00:10:54,030 --> 00:10:59,500
that that we design consumer electronics
when you have a hardware update that is

182
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:00,260
the same

183
00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:04,180
as a firmware update so

184
00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:07,300
on you know so I think that this is
where

185
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:11,320
I where on the bus some all the fuss
really

186
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:15,280
hope that all this stuff goes to the
Star Trek style

187
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:18,939
you can have you can have anything that
you want anytime that you want

188
00:11:18,940 --> 00:11:22,710
okay that is great

189
00:11:22,710 --> 00:11:25,940
I've been I've been and talk about the
future

190
00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:29,380
it's going to be wonderful I by I

191
00:11:29,380 --> 00:11:32,480
you know but seriously how do we
actually

192
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:35,680
start with just bring something I'm such
a nerd me now

193
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:40,560
okay um good as wanna do we know it's

194
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:44,450
great so innocent mostly everybody

195
00:11:44,450 --> 00:11:48,150
arm in San if you don't it is a on

196
00:11:48,150 --> 00:11:51,650
it is a I really simple really easy to
use

197
00:11:51,650 --> 00:11:55,260
electronics prototyping platform if I

198
00:11:55,260 --> 00:11:58,640
if you actually the

199
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:01,910
look kinda under the hood all it is
really it's just

200
00:12:01,910 --> 00:12:05,589
a I user-friendly kinda dead cat

201
00:12:05,590 --> 00:12:09,370
I'm for the for an at now
microcontroller

202
00:12:09,370 --> 00:12:13,170
and if we take a look at

203
00:12:13,170 --> 00:12:17,180
look at this some I am

204
00:12:17,180 --> 00:12:20,820
at this piece a open source hardware you
can see that it's not

205
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:23,880
really Foley so the doping you

206
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:27,230
you have open source software you have
open source layout

207
00:12:27,230 --> 00:12:30,230
up the board but if you actually want to
get inside

208
00:12:30,230 --> 00:12:34,070
the Mike retorts out such a black box

209
00:12:34,070 --> 00:12:37,860
it's a literal black box in NY

210
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:41,060
is um gives twice the prop

211
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:44,650
arm for Supply said on

212
00:12:44,650 --> 00:12:47,720
its literal black box

213
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:51,589
and it's also something that you can't
billowed on bill

214
00:12:51,589 --> 00:12:55,200
arm on your own time calling that the
the

215
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:58,670
I A pencil problem arm

216
00:12:58,670 --> 00:13:01,950
you know which is based of the Saar that

217
00:13:01,950 --> 00:13:05,040
I say that says it is not

218
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:08,380
on it is not possible for a single

219
00:13:08,380 --> 00:13:11,510
for a single person to build

220
00:13:11,510 --> 00:13:15,610
on to build something as simple I'm
simple

221
00:13:15,610 --> 00:13:19,520
something if it's a pencil arm years in
the white a chance to you

222
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:23,120
stand to action make my credential arm

223
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:27,110
from a more up from a more practical
perspective

224
00:13:27,110 --> 00:13:31,210
if you need to I you say um use a
certain

225
00:13:31,210 --> 00:13:34,800
you know my controller for your project
the

226
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:38,160
life but save the say that they

227
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:41,329
standard kinder to me know has I

228
00:13:41,330 --> 00:13:44,350
has twenty pence you can use

229
00:13:44,350 --> 00:13:47,730
arm if you want to use 21 pins

230
00:13:47,730 --> 00:13:51,920
you have to move up onto the whole on

231
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:54,950
to the whole next level of the chip that
it may be has a

232
00:13:54,950 --> 00:13:58,890
40 pence something and on insane just
gonna wasting

233
00:13:58,890 --> 00:14:02,470
the in which the Pens their arm

234
00:14:02,470 --> 00:14:05,580
into the other practical problem is I

235
00:14:05,580 --> 00:14:09,040
sense sense these are all from the same

236
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:13,260
supplier if there's any I'm kinda you
know disruption

237
00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:17,490
a you know the supply chain you aren't
going to be able to get

238
00:14:17,490 --> 00:14:21,160
the get the parts that you need for open
source hardware

239
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:25,280
arm which of course leads %uh leads to a

240
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:29,410
second problem a the

241
00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:32,520
up the up the possibility of having this

242
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:37,990
this picard where arm I spark fun had
this problem when they were trying to

243
00:14:37,990 --> 00:14:41,130
I'm source some my controllers from but
say some

244
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:44,890
shady year I kinda places and they got

245
00:14:44,890 --> 00:14:48,480
I guy I got one of these

246
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:52,420
chips want to miss fake one of them is
real on if you can

247
00:14:52,420 --> 00:14:56,709
if you can tell the difference between
to you probably

248
00:14:56,709 --> 00:15:01,630
have already read getting rather article
but they look

249
00:15:01,630 --> 00:15:05,600
looks like the same no way to tell so

250
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:09,440
use and what I am so then get what I
want to suggest

251
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:12,940
is that day if we do actually want to
print

252
00:15:12,940 --> 00:15:16,920
honored we know we need to have and open
source

253
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:20,300
Mike controller so let's

254
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:24,100
start the beginning what is a
microcontroller

255
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:28,570
exactly it is just a small scale
computer see need to have

256
00:15:28,570 --> 00:15:32,740
AI say you need to have a processor core
with a CPU

257
00:15:32,740 --> 00:15:37,100
and 9a are you in it you need some
memory and then you need some

258
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:40,500
inputs and outputs so you can talk to
the real world

259
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:44,000
I how I how my control or actually works

260
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,830
on so it just has a series on

261
00:15:47,830 --> 00:15:51,530
up instructions that it is able to Ron
and

262
00:15:51,530 --> 00:15:56,390
that is seem to find you know but
command set

263
00:15:56,390 --> 00:16:00,470
but on innocent by to the what action
makes it go

264
00:16:00,470 --> 00:16:04,100
are millions and millions I love

265
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:11,100
transistors yes

266
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:16,110
oo umm arm

267
00:16:16,110 --> 00:16:19,820
Gibson this was some this was

268
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:25,530
just looking at data sheet as able to
find that'd you know that it had a nice

269
00:16:25,530 --> 00:16:32,530
nice graphic a bit

270
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:47,250
yes yes

271
00:16:48,290 --> 00:16:52,209
so then I so arm

272
00:16:52,209 --> 00:16:55,639
she wants to know what part are

273
00:16:55,639 --> 00:17:00,029
what part the the aching in my control
or I am hoping

274
00:17:00,029 --> 00:17:03,449
I've that I hope to you know to

275
00:17:03,449 --> 00:17:06,659
open source here arm

276
00:17:06,659 --> 00:17:10,899
I I actually want to have the ability

277
00:17:10,899 --> 00:17:15,189
I to actually build my own from the
ground up

278
00:17:15,189 --> 00:17:19,039
ants

279
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:22,309
I and if you look at

280
00:17:22,309 --> 00:17:26,819
what is on the inside up my controller
is just millions upon millions

281
00:17:26,819 --> 00:17:30,570
a transistors all arranged in a certain
way

282
00:17:30,570 --> 00:17:33,720
I so the sex part

283
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:37,020
I'm just gonna skip through I kinda fast
because

284
00:17:37,020 --> 00:17:40,668
nobody wants to have a physics lecture
on a Friday night

285
00:17:40,669 --> 00:17:47,669
its hey okay happy I stand corrected

286
00:17:48,730 --> 00:17:52,190
but okay arm all you need to know

287
00:17:52,190 --> 00:17:55,429
I um for this

288
00:17:55,429 --> 00:17:59,370
for this little introduction to
transistors

289
00:17:59,370 --> 00:18:04,230
you can think of it as a3 terminal kinda
device so you have a source

290
00:18:04,230 --> 00:18:07,289
a drain and the gate arm

291
00:18:07,289 --> 00:18:11,400
the the current between the source in
the drain

292
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:14,799
is I'm is

293
00:18:14,799 --> 00:18:19,490
controlled 5 voltage you apply to the
gate and

294
00:18:19,490 --> 00:18:23,140
and for standard CMOS technology now

295
00:18:23,140 --> 00:18:26,500
you you you have I

296
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:29,940
to type 2 transistors which are

297
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:33,260
which are complementary transistors so
you have

298
00:18:33,260 --> 00:18:36,490
see happen n-type and you

299
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:39,760
have a p-type say you have one of them
which is

300
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:42,789
which is turned on when you have a high
voltage on the gate and one of them is

301
00:18:42,789 --> 00:18:43,370
turned on

302
00:18:43,370 --> 00:18:47,559
have a low voltage on the gate arm

303
00:18:47,559 --> 00:18:50,740
how do you actually make these the make
these transistors

304
00:18:50,740 --> 00:18:53,880
I'm not gonna go through all this on if
on

305
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:57,470
if you want to know more this this
Sunday there is

306
00:18:57,470 --> 00:19:01,370
at at twelve o'clock right back here
there is going to be a

307
00:19:01,370 --> 00:19:04,890
pretty call talk going through going
through the whole process

308
00:19:04,890 --> 00:19:08,340
arm I want to say here it's a very I

309
00:19:08,340 --> 00:19:11,470
long complex process

310
00:19:11,470 --> 00:19:16,200
additive and its attractive down at that
involve some

311
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:20,340
really I'll really expensive equal men
and also some

312
00:19:20,340 --> 00:19:25,580
really hazardous chemicals along the way
so as I said

313
00:19:25,580 --> 00:19:29,279
on I how do you how did the

314
00:19:29,279 --> 00:19:33,490
transistors actually work on see here
for the

315
00:19:33,490 --> 00:19:38,000
with anti transistor I I am

316
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,399
when you add when you I

317
00:19:41,399 --> 00:19:45,299
when I when you have the gate voltage
lessen the pressure

318
00:19:45,299 --> 00:19:50,010
voltage you or not I have a channel that
is between the source and drain

319
00:19:50,010 --> 00:19:54,000
I once the gate voltage and

320
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,820
x's a it X each threshold voltage you
will

321
00:19:57,820 --> 00:20:01,070
turn on the transistor and you allow it
to

322
00:20:01,070 --> 00:20:04,889
conduct so if we have

323
00:20:04,890 --> 00:20:09,190
these if we have these transistors we
are then able to

324
00:20:09,190 --> 00:20:12,659
start a star combine the switches and
dis into something

325
00:20:12,659 --> 00:20:17,980
I'm something useful so if you combine
these two transistors like so you can

326
00:20:17,980 --> 00:20:21,289
I'm you can make make converter

327
00:20:21,289 --> 00:20:26,360
sell for example when you have a is on
AA is low it is gonna turn on the

328
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:30,360
the top 10 to Syria see height the
output 1a as high as a turn on the pine

329
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:30,799
trees

330
00:20:30,799 --> 00:20:34,908
and you'll see in to see the low at the
output on

331
00:20:34,909 --> 00:20:38,340
you can then start to you I and

332
00:20:38,340 --> 00:20:42,260
start to build up more complex logic
gates in the same

333
00:20:42,260 --> 00:20:46,390
in the same way ands arm

334
00:20:46,390 --> 00:20:50,039
and then you can actually start to build
these kinds of logic gates

335
00:20:50,039 --> 00:20:53,770
on using the actual transistors

336
00:20:53,770 --> 00:20:57,408
on

337
00:20:57,409 --> 00:21:00,990
so than just the note on note on

338
00:21:00,990 --> 00:21:04,880
arm I hey we design something like a

339
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:07,880
something like my controller that is on
that I

340
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:12,500
that is made up of all these logic gates
you can numb

341
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:15,909
you can either use a hardware
description language like Verilog

342
00:21:15,909 --> 00:21:18,970
or or VHDL

343
00:21:18,970 --> 00:21:22,960
where on where just i'm saying how the
gates

344
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:26,169
should and should be hooked up arm

345
00:21:26,169 --> 00:21:29,270
I am or you can actually do the

346
00:21:29,270 --> 00:21:32,929
layout yourself arms on silicon I'm so
this is all

347
00:21:32,929 --> 00:21:36,460
showing I am showing the

348
00:21:36,460 --> 00:21:40,179
Bhd 0 for 4 matter and its I'm showing

349
00:21:40,179 --> 00:21:43,230
the showing the cell can lay out for

350
00:21:43,230 --> 00:21:46,570
for full adders in three different so
can technologies

351
00:21:46,570 --> 00:21:50,168
on if by if

352
00:21:50,169 --> 00:21:54,429
if you want to get started in this a
circuit design I area cadences the

353
00:21:54,429 --> 00:21:58,750
to a choice but expensive there are some
great free tools

354
00:21:58,750 --> 00:22:01,990
that are that are part by for door you

355
00:22:01,990 --> 00:22:06,230
the door electronics lab so if you wanna
sir playing with that that's a great

356
00:22:06,230 --> 00:22:08,149
starting point

357
00:22:08,149 --> 00:22:11,870
okay legal issues I'm not a lawyer so

358
00:22:11,870 --> 00:22:16,080
all this this a may or may not be

359
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:19,379
I so all this is a non is an

360
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:22,860
you legal advice um all I wanna say here

361
00:22:22,860 --> 00:22:26,470
is that arm is that there are

362
00:22:26,470 --> 00:22:30,039
multiple layers other legal legal

363
00:22:30,039 --> 00:22:33,870
print legal protection for for most the

364
00:22:33,870 --> 00:22:37,340
is kinda integrated circuits on you know
so there's even

365
00:22:37,340 --> 00:22:40,928
a.m. even a the special attempt to mask

366
00:22:40,929 --> 00:22:44,549
work arm which I which

367
00:22:44,549 --> 00:22:48,158
for Texas ok and layout arm there've
been

368
00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:51,220
their in patton dispute over features

369
00:22:51,220 --> 00:22:54,220
that a random that are in I

370
00:22:54,220 --> 00:22:57,309
you know the ICE's and Celeste never
talk about

371
00:22:57,309 --> 00:23:01,570
is arm for a lot of these kind

372
00:23:01,570 --> 00:23:05,480
technologies if you even want to get
started

373
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:08,789
trying trying to design any these i sees

374
00:23:08,789 --> 00:23:12,340
you need to you need to signing sign an
NDA

375
00:23:12,340 --> 00:23:16,520
if you want want access to the tools

376
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:20,679
so I'm here's an interesting example
this is the

377
00:23:20,679 --> 00:23:25,379
firsts commercially available
microprocessor this is the

378
00:23:25,379 --> 00:23:30,010
Intel 4004 the the schematics and layout

379
00:23:30,010 --> 00:23:33,700
day they are available online

380
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:37,080
by by I'm not sure if it is

381
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:41,350
even legal for someone if they wanted to
start their own fab just

382
00:23:41,350 --> 00:23:44,530
to to use this as a design

383
00:23:44,530 --> 00:23:48,158
they could sell fortunately there are

384
00:23:48,159 --> 00:23:51,590
on there are projects who are

385
00:23:51,590 --> 00:23:57,299
I who are working on these open source
kinda my controllers on this is

386
00:23:57,299 --> 00:24:00,750
from the open course project where they
actually do have a fall

387
00:24:00,750 --> 00:24:05,110
on full processor based on the open risk

388
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:08,909
architecture they have shown it working
on an FPGA

389
00:24:08,909 --> 00:24:12,530
and arm there now trying to raise money

390
00:24:12,530 --> 00:24:15,990
om to I to

391
00:24:15,990 --> 00:24:20,679
to so they actually make these on a
silicon chip

392
00:24:20,679 --> 00:24:24,149
in San this is hard because if you want
to actually

393
00:24:24,149 --> 00:24:27,960
compile silicon source code you need to
have

394
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:31,870
your own fat and fat these days are

395
00:24:31,870 --> 00:24:35,159
cost cost the whole lotta money so

396
00:24:35,159 --> 00:24:38,460
the I knew s1 opened up by

397
00:24:38,460 --> 00:24:43,320
by a GlobalFoundries not too long ago
cost 4.6

398
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:46,928
your billion dollars cost a lot just to
get

399
00:24:46,929 --> 00:24:50,789
I just to get into the game on
fortunately

400
00:24:50,789 --> 00:24:54,840
there are some projects where there have
been some people

401
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:58,658
working at home to see if they can
fabricate their own

402
00:24:58,659 --> 00:25:02,169
transistors I am Jeri Ellsworth was i'd

403
00:25:02,169 --> 00:25:05,470
was by some in our gym first I

404
00:25:05,470 --> 00:25:08,870
the the first two to

405
00:25:08,870 --> 00:25:12,299
demonstrate working silicon transistor
made it home and then

406
00:25:12,299 --> 00:25:16,330
other projects such as the which the
home CMOS project which are kinda

407
00:25:16,330 --> 00:25:17,730
following in

408
00:25:17,730 --> 00:25:22,010
and and her in her footsteps to bring

409
00:25:22,010 --> 00:25:27,639
I DIY sold him to the masses

410
00:25:27,639 --> 00:25:31,789
cell I I would say

411
00:25:31,789 --> 00:25:36,450
that everyone a truly open source the
amino we are going to be able to do that

412
00:25:36,450 --> 00:25:40,580
and do that and so can any time soon so
we really need

413
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:43,620
to to reimagine what we want

414
00:25:43,620 --> 00:25:47,059
out of the air to me now arm

415
00:25:47,059 --> 00:25:52,610
yep yes

416
00:25:52,610 --> 00:25:56,120
on guess the question is

417
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:59,830
I am unison what I mean by printing

418
00:25:59,830 --> 00:26:04,408
I am so then and we know arm guess know
what I mean by that

419
00:26:04,409 --> 00:26:07,429
I am is is you

420
00:26:07,429 --> 00:26:11,809
is you have a machine of some sorts hit
a button

421
00:26:11,809 --> 00:26:15,500
ended up and did spits out southerner

422
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:22,500
spits out you know there'd be enough for
you

423
00:26:23,450 --> 00:26:27,859
so I am unison that is kinda long term
goal

424
00:26:27,859 --> 00:26:34,859
here

425
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:43,309
yes yes um on certainly

426
00:26:43,309 --> 00:26:46,870
you can use arm something like an FPGA

427
00:26:46,870 --> 00:26:50,769
by by by

428
00:26:50,769 --> 00:26:55,039
if you don't have your own kind a
machine that simply can't spit on FPGA

429
00:26:55,039 --> 00:26:55,789
for you

430
00:26:55,789 --> 00:26:59,169
then you can really colony

431
00:26:59,169 --> 00:27:02,260
Foley way a fully

432
00:27:02,260 --> 00:27:06,309
printable you know version up there to
me and that's akin ok kinda

433
00:27:06,309 --> 00:27:11,110
kinda far off kinda confused Ristic but
I think it's a goal

434
00:27:11,110 --> 00:27:14,519
goal that is worth striving for goal
that is

435
00:27:14,519 --> 00:27:17,909
worth I worth thinking about thing about

436
00:27:17,909 --> 00:27:21,419
I how would we actually make that I'll

437
00:27:21,419 --> 00:27:25,399
let's have a dream and like you know
more something that actually do

438
00:27:25,399 --> 00:27:29,250
cell I'm so

439
00:27:29,250 --> 00:27:32,940
arm hopefully I have convinced you

440
00:27:32,940 --> 00:27:36,720
I yes get soaking his heart by

441
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:41,760
arm by if it but there are other summit
conducting

442
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:44,899
kinda materials that are out there arm

443
00:27:44,899 --> 00:27:48,570
you know that you can use to make
transistors I'm so

444
00:27:48,570 --> 00:27:51,908
on this is a figure from from

445
00:27:51,909 --> 00:27:56,139
I me to my facebook if II yet you want
to know more

446
00:27:56,139 --> 00:27:59,700
more about it that is a certainly a
great place to start by

447
00:27:59,700 --> 00:28:03,580
arms and what I want to show here is
this can be

448
00:28:03,580 --> 00:28:06,769
a completely additive process

449
00:28:06,769 --> 00:28:11,700
which which would be nice because having
just a and

450
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:15,590
just saying just saying additive process
pairs

451
00:28:15,590 --> 00:28:18,799
well with something like 3d printing
which is itself

452
00:28:18,799 --> 00:28:22,679
an additive process still

453
00:28:22,679 --> 00:28:27,019
arm unison I don't wanna give you that
the wrong idea

454
00:28:27,019 --> 00:28:30,960
that um you know that we're gonna turn
around and

455
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:34,080
start to so to print out this kind of
stuff

456
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:37,279
tomorrow this is still a very active
area

457
00:28:37,279 --> 00:28:40,360
arm South Africa research and

458
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:44,059
I on and so need some help to get

459
00:28:44,059 --> 00:28:49,269
out in lab stage and get more to the
masses and

460
00:28:49,269 --> 00:28:53,250
on you to secure the problems I want to
highlight here

461
00:28:53,250 --> 00:28:58,730
so it's the use out the material staff
to use you have some really weird

462
00:28:58,730 --> 00:29:03,120
really I'll really kinda exotic things
we're using

463
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:06,750
and you note that really doesn't fit
with

464
00:29:06,750 --> 00:29:11,929
the open-source I open source you know
kinda mentality that that

465
00:29:11,929 --> 00:29:16,470
pretty much any kinda material that you
get should be safe should be

466
00:29:16,470 --> 00:29:19,779
easy to use should be NBC source

467
00:29:19,779 --> 00:29:23,090
I'm if you look at this active Inc

468
00:29:23,090 --> 00:29:26,730
and and 3e thousand

469
00:29:26,730 --> 00:29:31,909
if you want to buy it you have to you
actually have to

470
00:29:31,909 --> 00:29:34,990
sign an NDA and

471
00:29:34,990 --> 00:29:38,110
I you are not allowed to

472
00:29:38,110 --> 00:29:41,409
publish any the results that you get
with some like this

473
00:29:41,409 --> 00:29:44,730
if you don't have their their explicit
okay

474
00:29:44,730 --> 00:29:48,549
so

475
00:29:48,549 --> 00:29:51,860
I I'm so that when I was saying you can

476
00:29:51,860 --> 00:29:55,549
pair this kinda fabrication I love

477
00:29:55,549 --> 00:29:59,120
are organic electronics

478
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:02,690
with the with the 3d printing

479
00:30:02,690 --> 00:30:07,010
technology on if you think about a 3d
printer

480
00:30:07,010 --> 00:30:10,889
all it is is AI is a three-axis

481
00:30:10,889 --> 00:30:14,320
CE and CN CNC machine

482
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:18,010
with a with plastic eg

483
00:30:18,010 --> 00:30:21,960
classic X X shooter had so you can
definitely

484
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:25,720
see well hey I'm you know what if

485
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:30,169
what if instead of having a head that
exceeds plastic I have had that extra

486
00:30:30,169 --> 00:30:33,649
wire arm that extruders

487
00:30:33,649 --> 00:30:37,210
a low melting point metal on

488
00:30:37,210 --> 00:30:41,029
or if I I'll or if I have a pen loaded
up

489
00:30:41,029 --> 00:30:45,870
with some inks that I want to print then
you can start to use your 3d printer to

490
00:30:45,870 --> 00:30:46,450
print

491
00:30:46,450 --> 00:30:50,460
electronics and I

492
00:30:50,460 --> 00:30:53,940
some then something else that we need to
think about

493
00:30:53,940 --> 00:30:57,409
I'm trying to design %uh

494
00:30:57,409 --> 00:31:01,500
design an entire open source from source

495
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:05,720
my controller that is going to be hard
but

496
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:08,820
by for a lot of projects

497
00:31:08,820 --> 00:31:12,029
having my controller is really

498
00:31:12,029 --> 00:31:16,190
not even some that you need on you know
so you can think about doing

499
00:31:16,190 --> 00:31:20,159
things and software we can go back to
the old days

500
00:31:20,159 --> 00:31:26,200
where you were doing more the stuff and
hardware

501
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:30,250
on I use their final

502
00:31:30,250 --> 00:31:34,580
final kinda point to make is arm

503
00:31:34,580 --> 00:31:37,879
you know so we have a good good good way
to share

504
00:31:37,879 --> 00:31:41,740
objects we have a good way to share
hardware schematics

505
00:31:41,740 --> 00:31:45,429
we have a good way to to to

506
00:31:45,429 --> 00:31:49,330
share software source code how do we
share something

507
00:31:49,330 --> 00:31:52,480
that is gonna have all of those arm

508
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:56,409
in a single file that you can send to
some

509
00:31:56,409 --> 00:32:00,119
kinda printer that it's going to be able
to voted off into one

510
00:32:00,119 --> 00:32:03,669
and spit out the object that you won

511
00:32:03,669 --> 00:32:06,779
so on I have rambled on and off

512
00:32:06,779 --> 00:32:11,049
on I hopefully I have gotten

513
00:32:11,049 --> 00:32:15,649
you excited about this about the

514
00:32:15,649 --> 00:32:18,820
combination of these 3 the three

515
00:32:18,820 --> 00:32:21,908
technologies and the I and

516
00:32:21,909 --> 00:32:25,389
and all the possibilities they can open
up so

517
00:32:25,389 --> 00:32:28,389
now I'd like to open up to any questions

518
00:32:28,389 --> 00:32:35,389
thanks very much

519
00:32:44,340 --> 00:32:44,840
yes

520
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:51,840
yes

521
00:32:53,700 --> 00:32:56,929
okay yes arm arm

522
00:32:56,929 --> 00:33:00,100
units that have so the question was
about the

523
00:33:00,100 --> 00:33:04,160
kinda densities up the printed
transistors

524
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:07,340
we are able to get arm currently

525
00:33:07,340 --> 00:33:10,600
I am if you look at Sorkin

526
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:15,070
transistors they have a Gateway Inc are
the tickets $20

527
00:33:15,070 --> 00:33:18,480
to so many meters now arm

528
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:21,809
we on we I

529
00:33:21,809 --> 00:33:25,559
have to get links I love about 12

530
00:33:25,559 --> 00:33:28,928
10 microns so we are

531
00:33:28,929 --> 00:33:33,410
we are large so large area transistors
large area

532
00:33:33,410 --> 00:33:40,410
electronics from here

533
00:33:55,720 --> 00:33:56,499
arm

534
00:33:56,499 --> 00:34:00,740
so the question is what are some of the

535
00:34:00,740 --> 00:34:04,399
manufacturing I techniques that we use

536
00:34:04,399 --> 00:34:07,960
um to build these assertive electronics
arm

537
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:11,010
summer on some other materials

538
00:34:11,010 --> 00:34:15,450
we are we are working with can be
screened

539
00:34:15,449 --> 00:34:19,250
%uh screen printed on some of them can
be printed

540
00:34:19,250 --> 00:34:24,069
using inkjet I kinda bring some

541
00:34:24,069 --> 00:34:27,779
them half to be I have to be

542
00:34:27,779 --> 00:34:31,239
the the have to beat the

543
00:34:31,240 --> 00:34:34,599
posit using I on

544
00:34:34,599 --> 00:34:37,740
s spin coating or arm

545
00:34:37,740 --> 00:34:41,859
I'm or on or some other more

546
00:34:41,859 --> 00:34:45,149
I traditional

547
00:34:45,149 --> 00:34:48,779
on I kind of equipment

548
00:34:48,779 --> 00:34:53,379
by units are always looking I for some
ways

549
00:34:53,379 --> 00:34:57,819
ways to kinda transitional the steps to
be

550
00:34:57,819 --> 00:35:01,549
I P just be just something

551
00:35:01,549 --> 00:35:08,549
liking check brings is kinda life

552
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:16,390
yeah up yes so if you look at

553
00:35:16,390 --> 00:35:19,600
a look at a look at

554
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:23,240
follow-on here this is essentially

555
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:26,530
AR this is he sensually a

556
00:35:26,530 --> 00:35:29,600
3d-printed and robot

557
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:32,930
a robot chassis with the

558
00:35:32,930 --> 00:35:36,299
with with all of the

559
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:40,010
traces kinda printed into it can
definitely get

560
00:35:40,010 --> 00:35:45,220
something like that arm yunus you know
I'm set to begin in 10 limitations ovett

561
00:35:45,220 --> 00:35:46,340
now

562
00:35:46,340 --> 00:35:50,630
arm all up the traces are on the same

563
00:35:50,630 --> 00:35:55,660
I same to deplane so it is actually a
possible to have it going

564
00:35:55,660 --> 00:35:59,910
get I definitely think that some

565
00:35:59,910 --> 00:36:06,910
it's going to be coming

566
00:36:15,230 --> 00:36:15,710
okay

567
00:36:15,710 --> 00:36:19,330
arm arm this

568
00:36:19,330 --> 00:36:22,480
so the voltages for the down

569
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:25,730
for the transistors that we normally

570
00:36:25,730 --> 00:36:29,500
work with I am for lab

571
00:36:29,500 --> 00:36:34,450
arm need about I need about forty faults

572
00:36:34,450 --> 00:36:38,370
on so it is %uh so it is certainly

573
00:36:38,370 --> 00:36:42,250
possible to to lower that on

574
00:36:42,250 --> 00:36:48,190
lower that voltage substantially by
using

575
00:36:48,190 --> 00:36:52,150
newer newer in a certain material

576
00:36:52,150 --> 00:36:55,680
on as your second question the most

577
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:59,529
I am the most I am kinda addressing
thing

578
00:36:59,530 --> 00:37:03,560
I have done the lab on so is actually
this

579
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:07,600
I that I its so the photo there

580
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:10,640
on the on the far right which is

581
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:14,170
I which is using a I yeah

582
00:37:14,170 --> 00:37:17,930
which is on which is using the hi

583
00:37:17,930 --> 00:37:21,169
unicorn Penn fighter I

584
00:37:21,170 --> 00:37:25,330
maker by I am kind of attachment to a

585
00:37:25,330 --> 00:37:29,150
to I to print some the layers

586
00:37:29,150 --> 00:37:32,390
for a printable transistor yes thank you

587
00:37:32,390 --> 00:37:35,960
a constructive use a laser pointer from
from the audience

588
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:42,960
I appreciate it keep em coming

589
00:37:47,130 --> 00:37:54,130
yes

590
00:37:57,190 --> 00:38:04,190
yes

591
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:08,589
right arm

592
00:38:08,589 --> 00:38:12,640
so I think you are probably going to

593
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:16,098
have to take a arm a

594
00:38:16,099 --> 00:38:19,910
similar kind of approach to the 3de

595
00:38:19,910 --> 00:38:24,270
printing kind of community if you look
at

596
00:38:24,270 --> 00:38:27,589
I'll look at all of the basic patents

597
00:38:27,589 --> 00:38:32,299
for 3d printing those words those were
from

598
00:38:32,300 --> 00:38:35,490
those were from the 70's those are now

599
00:38:35,490 --> 00:38:38,670
those are now day

600
00:38:38,670 --> 00:38:41,720
your attic you have expired

601
00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:46,540
gives unlike you what we can do weekend
go back to the nineteen seventies era

602
00:38:46,540 --> 00:38:50,359
and if I can be the greatest technology
but it's going to be an open

603
00:38:50,359 --> 00:38:57,359
source my control

604
00:39:06,950 --> 00:39:13,950
yes

605
00:39:14,530 --> 00:39:18,849
yes arm I it's so the so the

606
00:39:18,849 --> 00:39:22,260
question was on if it is if it is
possible to print

607
00:39:22,260 --> 00:39:25,460
I'm some sorta memory and on

608
00:39:25,460 --> 00:39:28,640
units the answer to that is is yes

609
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:32,440
is there are plenty other Punia group
working on

610
00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:35,840
I I printable

611
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:39,450
kinda memory cells based on the same on
kinda

612
00:39:39,450 --> 00:39:42,609
I'm kinda organic electronics

613
00:39:42,609 --> 00:39:46,200
I am and I

614
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:49,510
I am you know so they do

615
00:39:49,510 --> 00:39:52,619
have some that are able to kinda operate

616
00:39:52,619 --> 00:39:57,710
at the on on at the standard 3.35 all

617
00:39:57,710 --> 00:40:01,150
I on 5 all levels if you wanted to

618
00:40:01,150 --> 00:40:08,150
kinda interfaces sup with standard
electronics arm

619
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:13,869
we r arm I O

620
00:40:13,869 --> 00:40:18,020
we r we are making transistors that are
probably in

621
00:40:18,020 --> 00:40:22,500
the probably in the I tens to hundreds

622
00:40:22,500 --> 00:40:26,410
a kilohertz range arm

623
00:40:26,410 --> 00:40:30,129
unison as I i I said

624
00:40:30,130 --> 00:40:33,359
I these um these kinda

625
00:40:33,359 --> 00:40:37,020
unconventional electronics they will %ah
they will

626
00:40:37,020 --> 00:40:40,349
compliments sorting electronics they
certainly are going

627
00:40:40,349 --> 00:40:45,300
you know to replace ok in the tropics
sorry

628
00:40:45,300 --> 00:40:52,300
can't said

629
00:40:58,750 --> 00:41:05,750
yes

630
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:14,800
yes I I I

631
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:17,980
so i know i buy know I love by

632
00:41:17,980 --> 00:41:21,070
some I some groups who are

633
00:41:21,070 --> 00:41:25,330
who are work and using zinc oxide you
down

634
00:41:25,330 --> 00:41:28,369
I down so fucking a princeton

635
00:41:28,369 --> 00:41:31,540
but it's not but it's not something on

636
00:41:31,540 --> 00:41:35,070
I'm actively involved in cycling it
really can't really comment on it

637
00:41:35,070 --> 00:41:35,830
intelligently

638
00:41:35,830 --> 00:41:42,830
yes

639
00:41:53,500 --> 00:41:58,380
arm Island you know so that as I had
done

640
00:41:58,380 --> 00:42:03,470
I am had a few slides back

641
00:42:03,470 --> 00:42:08,430
there on there have been some the
research group

642
00:42:08,430 --> 00:42:11,830
%uh who have shown these are cool

643
00:42:11,830 --> 00:42:15,980
I who for they have shown these

644
00:42:15,980 --> 00:42:20,990
on 8-bit kinda my controllers that are
made out at the same

645
00:42:20,990 --> 00:42:25,250
I these on these organic

646
00:42:25,250 --> 00:42:29,420
sorta material on day I

647
00:42:29,420 --> 00:42:33,400
they they had been used any printing

648
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:37,470
techniques are make it but it's but it
is on

649
00:42:37,470 --> 00:42:44,470
but it is certainly I showing that's
possible

650
00:43:08,130 --> 00:43:14,180
yes

651
00:43:14,180 --> 00:43:18,379
yes on arm arm

652
00:43:18,380 --> 00:43:21,580
you're so I'm so the question is

653
00:43:21,580 --> 00:43:24,650
on how do you print the outside layer

654
00:43:24,650 --> 00:43:27,760
for the gate where you need to have a

655
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:30,790
need to have a very specific

656
00:43:30,790 --> 00:43:34,660
thickness for the gate arm for

657
00:43:34,660 --> 00:43:38,470
on for something like that

658
00:43:38,470 --> 00:43:41,690
we I'll we have been using

659
00:43:41,690 --> 00:43:45,680
screen printing I'm you know kind of
techniques

660
00:43:45,680 --> 00:43:49,069
because because that is that

661
00:43:49,070 --> 00:43:53,130
is useful for larger areas on I

662
00:43:53,130 --> 00:43:56,950
it ensures uniform uniform coverage

663
00:43:56,950 --> 00:44:00,120
%uh and it's a good way to

664
00:44:00,120 --> 00:44:07,120
to to can try the thickness of the layer

665
00:44:19,190 --> 00:44:22,540
yes

666
00:44:22,540 --> 00:44:29,540
yep

667
00:44:41,170 --> 00:44:47,120
yes

668
00:44:47,120 --> 00:44:51,589
red um so the so the

669
00:44:51,590 --> 00:44:55,810
question is on the use up you know the
materials

670
00:44:55,810 --> 00:44:59,250
and their toxicity and their Reese

671
00:44:59,250 --> 00:45:02,610
psych ability arm I

672
00:45:02,610 --> 00:45:06,290
how on how how

673
00:45:06,290 --> 00:45:09,930
or organic electronics some get their
name

674
00:45:09,930 --> 00:45:13,480
is on said these are all

675
00:45:13,480 --> 00:45:16,900
on these are all mostly carbon-based

676
00:45:16,900 --> 00:45:21,010
on carbon-based Minnesota compounds ands

677
00:45:21,010 --> 00:45:24,480
arm you know something we are working
with

678
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:27,900
actively in our lab is to

679
00:45:27,900 --> 00:45:31,250
on hi is to use graphene

680
00:45:31,250 --> 00:45:34,270
and graphene and

681
00:45:34,270 --> 00:45:36,780
carbon nanotubes I'm for these

682
00:45:36,780 --> 00:45:40,079
on for some the layers a these

683
00:45:40,079 --> 00:45:45,210
devices we are making arm you know so it
on

684
00:45:45,210 --> 00:45:50,760
so certainly even Adam even at some
point in the

685
00:45:50,760 --> 00:45:55,190
in the future you can even see having

686
00:45:55,190 --> 00:45:59,160
home all all carbon-based

687
00:45:59,160 --> 00:46:03,049
electronics see don't have any of these
um I'm

688
00:46:03,050 --> 00:46:06,940
anybody's on crazy chemicals that you
have and

689
00:46:06,940 --> 00:46:10,119
on have been all the electronics now

690
00:46:10,119 --> 00:46:17,119
have I played with the LightScribe
etching stuff no I have not

691
00:46:18,849 --> 00:46:25,849
incident what is special

692
00:46:30,530 --> 00:46:33,869
oh yes yes arm

693
00:46:33,869 --> 00:46:37,240
I guess then yeah

694
00:46:37,240 --> 00:46:42,569
I I now

695
00:46:42,569 --> 00:46:45,640
on your side with the question is about
there

696
00:46:45,640 --> 00:46:48,720
is it was on I there is

697
00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:52,319
their has been some work I'm showing

698
00:46:52,319 --> 00:46:55,400
you can use the arm use the

699
00:46:55,400 --> 00:46:59,339
you know laser source from the light
scribe

700
00:46:59,339 --> 00:47:02,339
arm DVD Drive

701
00:47:02,339 --> 00:47:06,940
on to build to build obvious
supercapacitors

702
00:47:06,940 --> 00:47:10,839
so then something certainly you could
start look at using that to build other

703
00:47:10,839 --> 00:47:11,400
types

704
00:47:11,400 --> 00:47:17,210
prices as well redone

705
00:47:17,210 --> 00:47:24,210
are sec yeah

706
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,700
I am our yield

707
00:47:30,700 --> 00:47:33,859
is %uh if

708
00:47:33,859 --> 00:47:37,529
if I get 10 percent yield

709
00:47:37,530 --> 00:47:40,800
I am happy I miss that yeah yeah

710
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:44,230
yes so yeah arm are

711
00:47:44,230 --> 00:47:47,349
i've certainly census sense this

712
00:47:47,349 --> 00:47:50,690
is you know just like in a research lab
on

713
00:47:50,690 --> 00:47:53,790
so on so that research scale

714
00:47:53,790 --> 00:47:57,640
if I am I if I have a substrate

715
00:47:57,640 --> 00:48:00,750
where I'm making making seventy for TV's

716
00:48:00,750 --> 00:48:05,069
if I can find I if I can unify the kid
was in the works

717
00:48:05,069 --> 00:48:08,319
i'm happy I'm done have done what I
wanted to do and show

718
00:48:08,319 --> 00:48:14,950
any other questions

719
00:48:14,950 --> 00:48:19,210
comments alright
