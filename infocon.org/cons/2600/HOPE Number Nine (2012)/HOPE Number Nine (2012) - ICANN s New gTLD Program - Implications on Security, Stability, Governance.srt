1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:04,200
top-level domain program thank you very
much

2
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:08,320
it's good to be here and just as an
aside

if anybody is looking to party paying
really interesting and there is

4
00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:18,680
there is a basically Grand Canyon side
pothole

5
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:22,020
on 34th in 10 to decide to ride my bike
into which is

6
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:25,519
well as well be limping around shifting
a lot up here

7
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:29,769
windsor knot upon pleasant another fun
way to spend my Friday evening

8
00:00:29,769 --> 00:00:34,180
around so any event my name's Alex
Avila's we can talk about i cant new

9
00:00:34,180 --> 00:00:35,540
gTLD program

10
00:00:35,540 --> 00:00:40,309
I am I am a technology lawyer with
Steptoe & Johnson

11
00:00:40,309 --> 00:00:43,360
I'll I've been involved the 2200 and
does

12
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:47,010
probably about 15 years old so going on
now

13
00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:50,260
going on nineteen years now I'll you
stood

14
00:00:50,260 --> 00:00:54,219
contrary pretty regularly with the
manual on off the hook and

15
00:00:54,219 --> 00:00:57,399
I work with a team of lawyers in my
office we've

16
00:00:57,399 --> 00:01:01,399
were basically responsible for a little
bit over ten percent of all the new gTLD

17
00:01:01,399 --> 00:01:02,350
applications

18
00:01:02,350 --> 00:01:05,519
summit I can this year I'm and

19
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:08,710
generally handle on management in a
government policy

20
00:01:08,710 --> 00:01:12,260
I'll prior to private practice my
background was some

21
00:01:12,260 --> 00:01:16,640
yet a little bit I worked a bit and
partner defense

22
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:20,560
was a graduate fellow any also general
counsel at CIA

23
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:24,299
dude from federally funded cyber
security intelligence or is in research

24
00:01:24,299 --> 00:01:25,689
and piloted

25
00:01:25,689 --> 00:01:30,640
it. at a software company participate in
things like the internet Association

26
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:34,750
privacy professionals privacy research
group at NYU the Internet Society

27
00:01:34,750 --> 00:01:38,009
and of course 2600 so

28
00:01:38,009 --> 00:01:41,329
Ben 10 right as a quick overview
presentation

29
00:01:41,329 --> 00:01:45,520
I i think we're gonna step through
what's going on with the new gTLD

30
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:47,329
program the status of it

31
00:01:47,329 --> 00:01:51,479
some the security issues that arose in
April 2012

32
00:01:51,479 --> 00:01:55,220
and then talk about the expansion at the
root zone

33
00:01:55,220 --> 00:01:59,408
and how this expansion the internet how
new gTLD is may affect our

34
00:01:59,409 --> 00:02:03,500
current form other Internet Governance
as well as so I love the

35
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:07,229
I'm tension and playing out right now
between

36
00:02:07,229 --> 00:02:10,818
nations in private industry with respect
to who controls the Internet

37
00:02:10,819 --> 00:02:16,099
so I noticed welcome hopefully just
reintroduce because I'm sure many

38
00:02:16,099 --> 00:02:20,790
love you arm very familiar with what I
Canada's but believe you are

39
00:02:20,790 --> 00:02:24,310
just breeze through the cell is densely
Internet Corporation for Assigned Names

40
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:26,520
and Numbers was formed in 1998

41
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:30,489
and basically the mission is to keep the
internet stable and secure

42
00:02:30,489 --> 00:02:34,739
and as well as to promote competition I
think that that but functional come up a

43
00:02:34,739 --> 00:02:36,019
little bit later as well

44
00:02:36,019 --> 00:02:40,670
so bob is what it is they said global
administrator policy is

45
00:02:40,670 --> 00:02:44,650
and there are responsible for universal
resolve ability of all domain names

46
00:02:44,650 --> 00:02:48,769
and they do this by maintaining
contracts with their internet registries

47
00:02:48,769 --> 00:02:52,390
run accreditation system for registrars
um

48
00:02:52,390 --> 00:02:55,900
and have a compliance department that
seems woefully inadequate for what's

49
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:56,629
ahead

50
00:02:56,629 --> 00:03:00,649
about then you're basically just

51
00:03:00,650 --> 00:03:04,879
to get our time straight to register in
is basically the database M

52
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:10,149
domains that belong to a particular
top-level domain registrars that which

53
00:03:10,150 --> 00:03:12,190
sells it remains on the registry on is
that

54
00:03:12,190 --> 00:03:15,379
person who's buying a domain I think we

55
00:03:15,379 --> 00:03:18,920
Thomas breeze through this so to give
you a quick look 'em

56
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:22,050
what we're really talking about here the
first a top level is the spot to the

57
00:03:22,050 --> 00:03:22,470
right

58
00:03:22,470 --> 00:03:26,930
on the dot here with this address the
dot board to the second level

59
00:03:26,930 --> 00:03:31,640
second-level domain would be me I can
and a third level is the meetings aspect

60
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:32,180
Elena

61
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:35,620
what's historic about ICANN's new gTLD
program is that

62
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:39,010
this is the first time ever that the
space to the right on the dot can be

63
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:40,079
customizable

64
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:44,069
that individual perpetual individual
entities

65
00:03:44,069 --> 00:03:47,680
persons one allowed to apply you had
applied to some kinda

66
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:51,849
business organization or entity %uh so
you could own to the right on the dot

67
00:03:51,849 --> 00:03:54,180
now you could have your brand you could
have

68
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:57,750
I your company name you could have a
generic name and then you could

69
00:03:57,750 --> 00:04:00,879
basically regulate the left to the
Dodger second-level domains

70
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:04,980
but the second level domain space is
still very very highly regulated by I

71
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:08,090
can what kind of the Wild West right now
is the third level

72
00:04:08,090 --> 00:04:11,180
the meetings dot space and I think that

73
00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:14,409
we're gonna see that we're gonna see I
can trying to rein that

74
00:04:14,409 --> 00:04:17,430
I under control over the next couple
years as well

75
00:04:17,430 --> 00:04:21,340
is that may prove to be a very fertile
source for cyber squatting in

76
00:04:21,340 --> 00:04:27,070
counterfeiting and as it has been
reading solely to the you know we really

77
00:04:27,070 --> 00:04:30,210
really stepped through what the deal
these are little currently 22 an

78
00:04:30,210 --> 00:04:31,020
operation

79
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:35,139
out without counting the country code
top-level domains like dot

80
00:04:35,139 --> 00:04:40,240
JP for Japan and I D E for Germany then
this application process is already

81
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:41,400
underway

82
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:45,940
for people to I'm purchase their own
top-level domains the right

83
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:49,780
and one or the other interesting aspects
on cecile you'll start to see once these

84
00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:51,530
are delegated in entered into the router

85
00:04:51,530 --> 00:04:55,320
you gonna start seeing ITN's were
internationalized domain name sadat

86
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:56,270
whatever can be in

87
00:04:56,270 --> 00:05:00,349
in arabic to convince a Realtor can be
in Russian %uh this is very possible at

88
00:05:00,350 --> 00:05:01,710
the top at the second level

89
00:05:01,710 --> 00:05:05,370
and some some top-level domains be nice
to see a lot

90
00:05:05,370 --> 00:05:09,490
%uh in the third level so

91
00:05:09,490 --> 00:05:14,530
just to give you a quick recap on us
applying for and buying a top level

92
00:05:14,530 --> 00:05:15,889
domain is not like

93
00:05:15,889 --> 00:05:19,080
going to go down in trying to register
second-level domain every single

94
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:22,969
application cost 185 thousand dollars to
submit

95
00:05:22,970 --> 00:05:26,410
%uh all that money went to I can I am

96
00:05:26,410 --> 00:05:30,600
the period was only open for about three
months it was years in the making the

97
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:33,370
application window opened on January
12th

98
00:05:33,370 --> 00:05:37,340
I'll you had to submit answers through
this has system

99
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:42,240
I was good the new gTLD application
system which ran through Citrix

100
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:45,520
I'm it was kinda silly system and and
we'll get through security which were

101
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:46,948
then in a second

102
00:05:46,949 --> 00:05:50,720
but basically you had to submit answers
to 50 questions

103
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:54,550
%uh and they used don't with your
technical capability to run registry

104
00:05:54,550 --> 00:05:57,500
your financial wherewithal to run the
registry

105
00:05:57,500 --> 00:06:01,100
information about the applicant entity
and generally

106
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:04,030
information about what kinda rights
protection mechanisms are going to have

107
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:05,250
in place

108
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:07,930
how you're going to participate and in
things like the trademark Clearinghouse

109
00:06:07,930 --> 00:06:09,860
are you going to

110
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:13,410
insure register on privacy and and
mitigate abuse

111
00:06:13,410 --> 00:06:16,680
within the top level domain so this will

112
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:19,710
supposed to be able for a period of
three months it was supposed to close

113
00:06:19,710 --> 00:06:21,080
April 13

114
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:25,900
but then there was a glitch with the
application system on April 12

115
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:29,470
are it was it was pretty bad actually no
people that are

116
00:06:29,470 --> 00:06:32,919
lot of difficulty getting into the
system and pretty much shut down until

117
00:06:32,919 --> 00:06:34,419
May 30th

118
00:06:34,419 --> 00:06:39,830
but at the end on May 30th it turns out
that 1,930 applications for top-level

119
00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:41,030
domains were

120
00:06:41,030 --> 00:06:45,430
submitted this is a lot more than one
out I can had anticipated

121
00:06:45,430 --> 00:06:48,550
and because of that they plan to use
this a

122
00:06:48,550 --> 00:06:51,979
a batching system to review the
applications and then have them

123
00:06:51,979 --> 00:06:54,599
delegated into the room before they go
live

124
00:06:54,599 --> 00:06:57,599
so course everybody want to have their
applications go first

125
00:06:57,599 --> 00:07:01,740
they came up with this digital archery
system which was net came to

126
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:05,919
essentially carnival game well unless
you have anybody and folders but it was

127
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:09,060
really into a very bizarre proposal
where

128
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:13,199
let's say I have an application and and
I want to be in the first batch

129
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:16,199
so I select the time select

130
00:07:16,199 --> 00:07:19,440
1201 and one second on

131
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:23,370
July 16 to basically hit a bottom

132
00:07:23,370 --> 00:07:26,680
and you would log into the system and
the closer you word

133
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:30,440
actually hitting the button at that
exact time know that that actually

134
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:31,560
determine what batch

135
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:35,270
and applications are going to be in so I
take carnival game

136
00:07:35,270 --> 00:07:38,680
it really was like a carnival game with
a hundred eighty-five thousand dollar

137
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:41,009
initial investment into it I mean it's

138
00:07:41,009 --> 00:07:45,400
we will sell it will also and I can just
recently over the last couple weeks

139
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:46,740
concluded its

140
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:50,009
meeting in prague and I know meeting
they dispensed with

141
00:07:50,009 --> 00:07:53,160
digital archery entirely and nobody has
any idea what they're going to replace

142
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:53,979
it with

143
00:07:53,979 --> 00:07:57,508
so batching is still a big consideration
and how they're going to handle this

144
00:07:57,509 --> 00:07:58,960
number about locations

145
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:02,970
so the probe the program is subject to
change it a bit in flux right now

146
00:08:02,970 --> 00:08:06,650
as I say here I'm so initial evaluation

147
00:08:06,650 --> 00:08:10,080
love these applications actually said to
occur

148
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:14,150
three days ago and I think it did occur
on time and on june thirteenth there was

149
00:08:14,150 --> 00:08:15,960
a very important day because

150
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:18,840
that was when all the non-confidential
portions of the applications were

151
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:22,599
revealed that when you could see the
1130am perturbations

152
00:08:22,599 --> 00:08:26,180
applied for Strings but also kicked off
this

153
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:29,300
a public comment period and the GAC
early-warning millet

154
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:33,649
the gap is I'm the government would rise
with me we're gonna get into them

155
00:08:33,649 --> 00:08:37,799
in just a little bit so the public
comment period is running right now no

156
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:42,200
closes on I think it's and midnight UTC

157
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:45,899
August 12th so basically anyone alaskans
would lead

158
00:08:45,899 --> 00:08:50,000
any comments on any new gTLD
applications right now

159
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,620
%uh there's no standing requirement and
what was going to say you know that the

160
00:08:53,620 --> 00:08:54,690
usual incidents

161
00:08:54,690 --> 00:08:57,690
you know a little bit lunacy in some
other public comments are being similar

162
00:08:57,690 --> 00:08:59,330
but I think we're gonna see is

163
00:08:59,330 --> 00:09:01,930
there's gonna be a lot I've been
fighting between applicants and I think

164
00:09:01,930 --> 00:09:03,140
public comments

165
00:09:03,140 --> 00:09:06,380
which can spur somebody called the
independent objective you can raise a

166
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:07,950
poll judge later

167
00:09:07,950 --> 00:09:11,390
those are could be instrumental and
returning your competitors as

168
00:09:11,390 --> 00:09:13,640
applications from going forward so

169
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:16,899
I think we're going to see a lot of big
corporations and while people

170
00:09:16,899 --> 00:09:20,080
interested in in deterring other strains
from being delegated

171
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:23,839
to use the public comment process is but
there's really no incentive to do until

172
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:28,500
literally the last day because why give
your opponent the opportunity to respond

173
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:32,260
so I think come august 10th and 11th
we're gonna start to see

174
00:09:32,260 --> 00:09:35,459
public comment period really kept our

175
00:09:35,459 --> 00:09:40,830
I'm deliver the breakdown like we said
1,930 applications

176
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:44,040
up 1409 applied for strings through

177
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:49,699
1155 entities and break this down
further about 53 percent these were dot

178
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:50,360
generic

179
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:53,940
terms like die Musik dog barked at Bab
that Abbas

180
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:58,089
is actually the most highly contested
and 34 percent in these are Gardot

181
00:09:58,089 --> 00:09:58,920
branson

182
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:02,479
armand Yahoo Google da McDonalds

183
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:05,790
I'm and those you're not going to be
able to register

184
00:10:05,790 --> 00:10:08,959
in the second level those are going to
be what's what's known as a close the

185
00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:10,070
registry

186
00:10:10,070 --> 00:10:12,970
but for the Dodge in Eric's their
business model is essentially going to

187
00:10:12,970 --> 00:10:13,950
be selling

188
00:10:13,950 --> 00:10:17,870
top-level domains the head community
applications which

189
00:10:17,870 --> 00:10:21,610
but say you have likely registered on
insurance and several different

190
00:10:21,610 --> 00:10:24,079
applicants applying for done insurance
right now

191
00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:28,010
and if you're if you represent the
insurance community

192
00:10:28,010 --> 00:10:31,839
you can opt out the other applicants so
their investment can be just basically

193
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:33,690
flushed down the toilet if you can

194
00:10:33,690 --> 00:10:37,630
meet these community priority criteria
and I'll

195
00:10:37,630 --> 00:10:41,689
done entrances is woman loan application
is undergoing a right now

196
00:10:41,690 --> 00:10:45,920
and then three percent were Geographic
Names now things like done in my C-dot

197
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:47,819
to but i dont London

198
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:51,769
I'm you didn't really see too much
participation from developing nations

199
00:10:51,769 --> 00:10:53,029
despite the fact that

200
00:10:53,029 --> 00:10:56,680
I can is really pushing it in and
offered some financial systems

201
00:10:56,680 --> 00:11:00,920
not you saw almost nothing coming from
Africa and with the exception of South

202
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:06,180
South Africa up mostly applications came
from North America and Europe

203
00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:12,360
on and you can multiply nineteen thirty
times 285,000 you figure out

204
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:15,800
and I can now has 257 million dollars
sitting

205
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:21,570
in his bank account I am and really only
to a little more than half for that

206
00:11:21,570 --> 00:11:24,779
is is accounted for in terms of expenses
so is

207
00:11:24,779 --> 00:11:30,019
supposed to be in excess a 160 million
dollars coming from this program

208
00:11:30,019 --> 00:11:33,360
lotta money for a not-for-profit
corporation through to take in

209
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:37,620
in just a few days I'm

210
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:41,180
that we also see their you know that
there wasn't the run any applications

211
00:11:41,180 --> 00:11:41,959
for

212
00:11:41,959 --> 00:11:46,290
things like dot hack don't freak with
NCAA 600

213
00:11:46,290 --> 00:11:51,110
I'm so the more interesting strings I
think we're like God WTF and out sucks

214
00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:53,990
which actually had three applications

215
00:11:53,990 --> 00:11:56,889
up so they're going under strain
contention we're gonna and I think there

216
00:11:56,889 --> 00:11:58,480
could be very interesting

217
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:03,070
but we're what terminating maybe we can
change this over the next couple years

218
00:12:03,070 --> 00:12:05,959
and it's a big gigantic investment and
nobody knew how this was going to pan

219
00:12:05,959 --> 00:12:07,700
out but I think we should

220
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:11,130
maybe get together some hacker space is
get together some resources maybe we

221
00:12:11,130 --> 00:12:12,200
should put in

222
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:16,339
an application for Don hacker don't
freak because that would ensure that

223
00:12:16,339 --> 00:12:19,540
as a talk a little on our voices
continue to be heard in

224
00:12:19,540 --> 00:12:24,060
I can't major stakeholder groups one of
which are the largest and arguably most

225
00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:27,779
powerful will probably come to be the
registry stakeholders group

226
00:12:27,779 --> 00:12:31,600
and anybody can run it in the registry I
think it would be people like us

227
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:34,790
so let's think about that in the future

228
00:12:34,790 --> 00:12:38,839
on shortage that absolute

229
00:12:38,839 --> 00:12:42,810
like

230
00:12:42,810 --> 00:12:45,770
what what did they spend it on a million
dollars on that

231
00:12:45,770 --> 00:12:50,069
like goes into expenses were well the
the actual review process

232
00:12:50,070 --> 00:12:53,860
takes a long time reviewing his ambition
to applications

233
00:12:53,860 --> 00:12:58,850
anywhere from you know sixty years
seventy pages to know 250 pages in

234
00:12:58,850 --> 00:13:02,380
a very tense and you know about a
hundred those generally technical data

235
00:13:02,380 --> 00:13:06,430
the related to back-end registry
services so valuing the applications

236
00:13:06,430 --> 00:13:08,220
researching the applicant's

237
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:12,400
I'm dealing with the dispute resolution
service providers handling strong

238
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:13,300
contention

239
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:17,530
although that's gonna be um up all that
is really counter for plus

240
00:13:17,530 --> 00:13:21,430
yeah I think I can did budget a bit for
legal fees there's there's no question

241
00:13:21,430 --> 00:13:22,740
that they're going to be facing

242
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:26,010
I think some some suits I'm

243
00:13:26,010 --> 00:13:29,730
but I think a lot of the budget and that
has come out in the a.m the I can

244
00:13:29,730 --> 00:13:30,600
broaden

245
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:35,350
I was going to be over budget in for up
quite a bit better so I think

246
00:13:35,350 --> 00:13:38,940
under $69 dollars in excess is probably
conservative figure

247
00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:43,400
there may be a lot more in excess so to
go into the gap here

248
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:46,450
the gag is the governmental Advisory
Committee their big

249
00:13:46,450 --> 00:13:49,920
constituent a bike and they're very very
powerful so

250
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:53,200
the hell is really wanting to know the
GAC has any problem

251
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:57,110
with your application big-tent submit
something called

252
00:13:57,110 --> 00:14:01,190
early-warning an hour and that's a major
impediment for your application don't

253
00:14:01,190 --> 00:14:02,580
vote in any member

254
00:14:02,580 --> 00:14:06,850
any gag representative up which I
believe 116 right now

255
00:14:06,850 --> 00:14:11,750
consummate early-warning most Indians
are going to lead to highly regulated

256
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:14,350
industries like insurance to Rome

257
00:14:14,350 --> 00:14:18,500
a were banking financial services that
kinda thing

258
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:21,930
and that's why I think we'll see a lot
alike the GAC

259
00:14:21,930 --> 00:14:26,070
interactions coming in anon

260
00:14:26,070 --> 00:14:29,620
now we're going to also see applicants
using the GAC

261
00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:34,670
offensively using their relationships
with the gag basically to bring up

262
00:14:34,670 --> 00:14:38,170
information or or concerns about other
applications

263
00:14:38,170 --> 00:14:41,400
but they wouldn't otherwise have review
themselves so

264
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:45,760
getting the gag on your side is gonna be
awesome basically and

265
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:49,339
a feather in your hat when it comes to
getting your application moving forward

266
00:14:49,339 --> 00:14:54,420
so let advice can take three forms
concerns as long consensus and

267
00:14:54,420 --> 00:14:55,310
remediation

268
00:14:55,310 --> 00:14:59,460
concerns as advice that's the worst kind
you can have your application probably

269
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:00,670
is not going to be improved

270
00:15:00,670 --> 00:15:04,450
not a consensus on racism a

271
00:15:04,450 --> 00:15:09,880
you know it's basically per it's gonna
be problematic for you because you can't

272
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:11,300
change your application

273
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:14,730
and remediation advised to be very
difficult to for the same reason you

274
00:15:14,730 --> 00:15:16,550
can't modify your application

275
00:15:16,550 --> 00:15:20,580
afterwards but consensus advice is
almost a little bit misleading because

276
00:15:20,580 --> 00:15:22,870
get consensus is reached by

277
00:15:22,870 --> 00:15:25,980
somebody making a proposal for something

278
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:29,870
and nobody else piping up about it so
it's basically

279
00:15:29,870 --> 00:15:32,959
consensus by a failure for anybody to
object

280
00:15:32,959 --> 00:15:36,700
so concerned his advisers is rich much
more easily than the name

281
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:40,310
implies and then you also have this is
we're

282
00:15:40,310 --> 00:15:44,410
lawyers get involved you have things
like Paul objections your legal rights

283
00:15:44,410 --> 00:15:45,730
objects and so let's say

284
00:15:45,730 --> 00:15:49,060
I'm I and I have a

285
00:15:49,060 --> 00:15:53,250
ride to a trademark until he buys from a
trademark I compose a legal rights

286
00:15:53,250 --> 00:15:56,050
objection even know I'm not a new gTLD
applicant

287
00:15:56,050 --> 00:16:00,490
and if that other person doesn't have
any legal rights to that particular

288
00:16:00,490 --> 00:16:01,339
strain

289
00:16:01,339 --> 00:16:04,420
then applications can be knocked down
but the interesting

290
00:16:04,420 --> 00:16:07,990
the interesting thing though is it if
the GTR the applicant does have a legal

291
00:16:07,990 --> 00:16:09,130
right to the strain

292
00:16:09,130 --> 00:16:13,010
then I can do about that go forward the
unit and it doesn't matter really how

293
00:16:13,010 --> 00:16:14,030
tenuous the

294
00:16:14,030 --> 00:16:18,030
am legal rights are so long as you you
have some form right to it

295
00:16:18,030 --> 00:16:21,949
I'm an assistant attorney because
probably were really encourages use

296
00:16:21,950 --> 00:16:24,010
nothing I can is really building on that

297
00:16:24,010 --> 00:16:27,610
and then strain confusion if you think
that there is some

298
00:16:27,610 --> 00:16:30,650
threatened to that another application
has because

299
00:16:30,650 --> 00:16:34,550
I do these things are so nearly
identical or very similar to each other

300
00:16:34,550 --> 00:16:39,010
now you can go into string confusion no
with them and ultimately

301
00:16:39,010 --> 00:16:42,720
now that could result in an auction and
even more money for I can

302
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:46,200
animal in a public interest objection
this isn't really gonna be used I think

303
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:49,709
at all which is if the TLD is I'm

304
00:16:49,709 --> 00:16:53,430
contrary to general principles of
international law morality and public

305
00:16:53,430 --> 00:16:54,420
order some

306
00:16:54,420 --> 00:16:58,250
at our toll burn and the community
objection we may see

307
00:16:58,250 --> 00:17:02,560
some communities piping up through the
community objection know for certain

308
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:03,420
applications

309
00:17:03,420 --> 00:17:06,929
but that remains missing and then

310
00:17:06,929 --> 00:17:11,040
as we just mentioned a strong contention
process it there are more the lab can

311
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:12,928
let sleeping dogs or da tab

312
00:17:12,929 --> 00:17:16,110
and they all passed through initial
evaluation and all qualified to run a

313
00:17:16,110 --> 00:17:16,929
register in

314
00:17:16,929 --> 00:17:21,720
what happens a century is I can let that
go to an auction

315
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:25,730
and the TLD goes to the highest bidder
and all the money goes to like him

316
00:17:25,730 --> 00:17:29,070
I not surprising that's running be
missed but

317
00:17:29,070 --> 00:17:34,320
I'm it that when all said delay your
application if you get stuck in a strong

318
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:36,290
contention said which there are many

319
00:17:36,290 --> 00:17:40,178
um you're looking at two and a half to
six months I think more likely six

320
00:17:40,179 --> 00:17:41,210
months before

321
00:17:41,210 --> 00:17:46,250
application could be delegated sale you
know a low blow to break down again

322
00:17:46,250 --> 00:17:50,020
I am 116 internationalized domain names

323
00:17:50,020 --> 00:17:54,120
am and the badging proposals really
still up in the air nobody knows how I

324
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:56,250
can is going to handle this many
applicants

325
00:17:56,250 --> 00:18:02,050
I'm there is a potential to get some
money back

326
00:18:02,050 --> 00:18:06,690
if you withdraw your application after
the GAC issues an early warning you can

327
00:18:06,690 --> 00:18:07,810
get eighty percent back

328
00:18:07,810 --> 00:18:10,850
so not not too bad I'm

329
00:18:10,850 --> 00:18:14,500
and basically the farther down to go in
the process less money you're going to

330
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:15,790
get back but

331
00:18:15,790 --> 00:18:19,280
a hundred eighty-five thousand dollars
for the application itself seems like a

332
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:20,379
lot of money but I think

333
00:18:20,380 --> 00:18:24,120
the real a the low-cost comes in

334
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:27,310
in putting together these applications
and contract so you have to sign so

335
00:18:27,310 --> 00:18:27,780
there's

336
00:18:27,780 --> 00:18:32,160
there's a lot %uh 'em outside
possibility to those

337
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:35,590
large fees are on the move course

338
00:18:35,590 --> 00:18:38,790
um and then a security glitch that
happened in April

339
00:18:38,790 --> 00:18:43,730
this was really bizarre because I on
April 12 the system was really grinding

340
00:18:43,730 --> 00:18:44,540
to a halt

341
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:48,590
nobody could really get an inmate know
any material change their application

342
00:18:48,590 --> 00:18:52,110
then it around 10 p.m. the whole thing
just went down

343
00:18:52,110 --> 00:18:55,460
everybody went home woke up the next
morning and found out

344
00:18:55,460 --> 00:18:59,970
that the system was gonna be taken off
for about eight days

345
00:18:59,970 --> 00:19:03,730
in and this was really disheartening for
me because I've been working be about 15

346
00:19:03,730 --> 00:19:05,090
hours a day for you

347
00:19:05,090 --> 00:19:08,270
the three weeks on this and it was like
watching

348
00:19:08,270 --> 00:19:11,330
you know finish line up a marathon just
beam

349
00:19:11,330 --> 00:19:16,010
picked up and moved eight miles away
from you know by some supernatural

350
00:19:16,010 --> 00:19:19,830
non-government organisation had it was
really disheartening we just wanted his

351
00:19:19,830 --> 00:19:21,840
habitation period to be over but

352
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:27,040
so there's a day period actually the big
lead turned into 40 days and 40 nights

353
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:30,800
no downtime there was nobody really knew
what happened

354
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:34,210
and I can was investing will happen
eventually whenever the security glitch

355
00:19:34,210 --> 00:19:34,880
in

356
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:38,160
were what it really wasn't it wasn't
really a big deal

357
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:42,800
but am if Ed interpreted for deletion
process was interrupted

358
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:46,480
through the Citrix Taz connection am

359
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:51,050
certain applicants were able to see the
file names but associated with other

360
00:19:51,050 --> 00:19:52,379
applications

361
00:19:52,380 --> 00:19:56,840
and they could have been revealing
worldwatch training and other applicant

362
00:19:56,840 --> 00:19:58,350
was applying for you know like

363
00:19:58,350 --> 00:20:01,360
for for order something for instance you
know could have been blowed

364
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:05,870
gTLD application attachment 31 dash 33
or something

365
00:20:05,870 --> 00:20:10,620
so lower some concerns about people the
confidentiality obligations being

366
00:20:10,620 --> 00:20:11,900
breached their

367
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:15,679
I'm but I can did confirm those numbers
were the result in the tag there is no

368
00:20:15,679 --> 00:20:17,590
data loss was no corruption

369
00:20:17,590 --> 00:20:21,949
be contacted all the applicants whose
file names were were compromised on

370
00:20:21,950 --> 00:20:25,540
they pored over the log files I think
very girly I'm

371
00:20:25,540 --> 00:20:29,810
but more importantly this kinda made I
can look really silly

372
00:20:29,810 --> 00:20:34,950
um the corporation and its in charge the
security and stability of the Internet

373
00:20:34,950 --> 00:20:38,630
couldn't even maintain its own
application system so there will be a

374
00:20:38,630 --> 00:20:40,250
lotta doubting I think they came

375
00:20:40,250 --> 00:20:43,740
a long look at but things have gotten
back on track

376
00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:47,910
I'm and I also love the issues that
we're facing here are

377
00:20:47,910 --> 00:20:51,410
you know is this expansion going to be

378
00:20:51,410 --> 00:20:55,120
Edo problematic to the root zone over
the Internet

379
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:59,120
am you know are there more security
issues coming down the pipe your

380
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:04,060
sober I can has said basically that you
know when I can add more than 1,000 new

381
00:21:04,060 --> 00:21:05,350
gTLD used to the room

382
00:21:05,350 --> 00:21:09,020
we're not going to allow one thousand
gTLD use to go live

383
00:21:09,020 --> 00:21:13,879
%uh in in the year I'm but this will
undoubtedly change the landscape of the

384
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:15,500
internet's going to change the way

385
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:18,560
the internet looks irrevocably I am

386
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:21,908
and for years now they've been debating
I'll whether or not

387
00:21:21,909 --> 00:21:25,909
this expansion at the root zone could
actually cause some kind of security and

388
00:21:25,909 --> 00:21:27,350
stability concern

389
00:21:27,350 --> 00:21:30,669
first back up quick sec I'm sure a lot
of you know what the DNS root

390
00:21:30,669 --> 00:21:34,720
is but may be sold was down more step to
a pretty quickly said basically is the

391
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:36,310
top level being a zone in

392
00:21:36,310 --> 00:21:41,200
in the namespace it did DNS root zone is
really that it's the key component in

393
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:42,100
the system

394
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:45,669
that every application that uses the
Internet that uses an

395
00:21:45,669 --> 00:21:48,899
essentially what is a big list above
board game servers that make the

396
00:21:48,899 --> 00:21:50,149
internet run

397
00:21:50,149 --> 00:21:53,770
am and everybody uses a so

398
00:21:53,770 --> 00:21:57,760
who runs this this gigantic list who
manages this there's

399
00:21:57,760 --> 00:22:00,870
there's really four major players I am

400
00:22:00,870 --> 00:22:04,360
you have the NTIA you'll see that
there's a lot of the US government

401
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:05,300
involvement and then

402
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:08,820
that will become relevant later in terms
of Internet government

403
00:22:08,820 --> 00:22:11,189
we have the MTA the National
Telecommunications and Information

404
00:22:11,190 --> 00:22:12,990
Administration

405
00:22:12,990 --> 00:22:17,300
they operate as an agency under the
Department of Commerce and he really

406
00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:18,460
have the ultimate authority

407
00:22:18,460 --> 00:22:23,800
over the route and always have I am now
the internet assigned numbers authority

408
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:26,870
I manages the zone file and

409
00:22:26,870 --> 00:22:31,899
interacts with the NTIA on basically
changes that are proposed to be made to

410
00:22:31,899 --> 00:22:32,690
the root

411
00:22:32,690 --> 00:22:36,840
and diana has historically always been
associated with I can as well in just a

412
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:38,290
few weeks ago

413
00:22:38,290 --> 00:22:44,070
I'm there was a rather the part of
Commerce remanded mobile the

414
00:22:44,070 --> 00:22:48,129
contract for the eye and a function to
like him and then Verisign

415
00:22:48,130 --> 00:22:51,190
which operates as a woman's own
maintainer

416
00:22:51,190 --> 00:22:54,740
and then just dispersed throughout the
world you have twelve different name

417
00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:56,290
server: operators

418
00:22:56,290 --> 00:23:00,460
and you normally again you see a lot of
US involvement in Seabury sign

419
00:23:00,460 --> 00:23:03,909
nasa the US Army Department of Defense

420
00:23:03,909 --> 00:23:08,490
and I believe what I can of course and
the University Melbourne

421
00:23:08,490 --> 00:23:12,630
wizard questionable up but

422
00:23:12,630 --> 00:23:16,450
certain and this is the dispersion

423
00:23:16,450 --> 00:23:20,110
root servers from room service downward
and you'll see you know they're they're

424
00:23:20,110 --> 00:23:21,090
really cluster

425
00:23:21,090 --> 00:23:24,959
mainly round Europe I'll and North
America quite a few

426
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:28,120
in South America I'm

427
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:31,220
siberia just doesn't really know they
just don't register on the map over

428
00:23:31,220 --> 00:23:33,090
there in time the root servers by Jim

429
00:23:33,090 --> 00:23:36,280
maybe maybe in a few years down the road
I'm also

430
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:41,450
Austria has there's a lot about elwin
servers around by I can downer

431
00:23:41,450 --> 00:23:44,710
and Australia has actually become no

432
00:23:44,710 --> 00:23:48,399
through several private organizations I
think what a major player in the I can

433
00:23:48,399 --> 00:23:49,360
world

434
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:52,530
so benefits of diversity of having his
router is all over the world are

435
00:23:52,530 --> 00:23:53,240
essentially

436
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:57,510
well they're not gonna be. to be easy to
take down an Adidas attack

437
00:23:57,510 --> 00:24:00,540
and they run all different types of
software on all different types a

438
00:24:00,540 --> 00:24:01,840
platform so

439
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:05,300
one security bug is not going to run
takedown

440
00:24:05,300 --> 00:24:09,470
the root servers that were
geographically dispersed

441
00:24:09,470 --> 00:24:13,929
I'll we've seen some prior expansion to
the root zone but nothing this dramatic

442
00:24:13,929 --> 00:24:18,800
every time a new top level domain is
dead the root zone changes little bit in

443
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:23,790
test internationalized domain names were
read in 2007 and 2010

444
00:24:23,790 --> 00:24:27,399
you saw on I am ideas for it gypsum

445
00:24:27,399 --> 00:24:31,340
with Saudi Arabia and United Arab
Emirates going going live

446
00:24:31,340 --> 00:24:35,629
I'm also with ipv6 deployment we're
seeing more more data being put into the

447
00:24:35,630 --> 00:24:36,530
end zone

448
00:24:36,530 --> 00:24:40,030
and DNS act which is used to sign the
root zone file

449
00:24:40,030 --> 00:24:43,530
%uh and so far you know this is just as
a text nothing

450
00:24:43,530 --> 00:24:47,010
nothing has caused a major impact on the
road

451
00:24:47,010 --> 00:24:50,830
nonetheless am wanna buy cans committee
is the

452
00:24:50,830 --> 00:24:54,750
Rosa study team I guess the roots
scaling study team

453
00:24:54,750 --> 00:24:59,000
stated a few years ago well you know it
could absorb the road should work could

454
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,409
absorb a small number

455
00:25:00,409 --> 00:25:03,940
annualized RT oldies together with

456
00:25:03,940 --> 00:25:07,040
introducing the NSA into the room um

457
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:10,320
well on the stand around concerns from
ITN's but

458
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:14,830
it's difficult to square this this
hesitation about adding things to the

459
00:25:14,830 --> 00:25:15,480
route was

460
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:20,800
with I cans full steam ahead mentality
batting 1000 to

461
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:25,830
sewer I M back to the main issue really
I mean

462
00:25:25,830 --> 00:25:29,020
does altering the size the router have a

463
00:25:29,020 --> 00:25:32,280
an effect and adverse affect on security
and stability

464
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:36,000
a.m. it's that aggregate effect really

465
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:40,190
that is is what the dramatic change the
route will be betting on the ipv6 DNS

466
00:25:40,190 --> 00:25:40,720
sec

467
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:44,390
ID and plus arguably a thousand feel
these a year.

468
00:25:44,390 --> 00:25:47,540
into the router I'm

469
00:25:47,540 --> 00:25:50,830
this could impact the root server loan

470
00:25:50,830 --> 00:25:54,360
this compact Reserve is really and in
two different ways and

471
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:58,020
I can has identified two issues in root
server operations

472
00:25:58,020 --> 00:26:02,340
and an impact on provisioning so true so
server operation to really your ability

473
00:26:02,340 --> 00:26:04,179
to respond to queries

474
00:26:04,179 --> 00:26:07,240
and provisioning pertains to the ability
to receive

475
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:10,560
and distribute new root zone files I'm

476
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:13,850
and I can to have no not really worried
we haven't seen any problems with us

477
00:26:13,850 --> 00:26:14,850
whatsoever

478
00:26:14,850 --> 00:26:18,040
I am they actually tell a recent study
which is

479
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:21,480
I think very definitive burned June 2012
just

480
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:25,280
just last month but the restaurant
servers really good

481
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:28,639
are they going to lose their ability to
respond requirements and if the room

482
00:26:28,639 --> 00:26:31,200
service can't respond to DNS queries

483
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:34,250
will that's good 'cause resolution to
ultimately fell

484
00:26:34,250 --> 00:26:38,490
and it would be a slow process because a
lot of people havel's information cash

485
00:26:38,490 --> 00:26:41,860
but that that s really only last for
about 48 hours

486
00:26:41,860 --> 00:26:45,090
so i cant analysis was well

487
00:26:45,090 --> 00:26:50,070
your performance on the root servers has
nothing to do with how many records RN

488
00:26:50,070 --> 00:26:53,780
top alums are are in the red zone itself
it's predicated

489
00:26:53,780 --> 00:26:57,649
on the number required a on

490
00:26:57,649 --> 00:27:00,800
root zone server has to respond to and

491
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:05,260
the total number of internet users is
what determines the number of cores

492
00:27:05,260 --> 00:27:08,530
so an increase in number to: these does
not necessarily

493
00:27:08,530 --> 00:27:12,389
equate to an increase and the number of
internet users

494
00:27:12,389 --> 00:27:17,230
furthermore the rate change into the
room would be very slow because we're

495
00:27:17,230 --> 00:27:19,530
not going to just tell you everything
ride alongs

496
00:27:19,530 --> 00:27:22,740
I'm we're gonna do one thousand a year

497
00:27:22,740 --> 00:27:26,500
plus we have all the system diversity
and operator coordination

498
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:29,990
so everything should be fine we can
handle motels new TLD that would

499
00:27:29,990 --> 00:27:33,350
my cancer but you know i i think that
there are

500
00:27:33,350 --> 00:27:37,550
some major issues that have not yet been
resolved because

501
00:27:37,550 --> 00:27:41,300
I answer first we'll start the crime
rates what about

502
00:27:41,300 --> 00:27:44,820
you'd internet users were about an
internet exchange points mean this has

503
00:27:44,820 --> 00:27:46,320
been a major

504
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:50,060
project for the Internet Society end and
I can as well in terms of global

505
00:27:50,060 --> 00:27:51,399
connectivity

506
00:27:51,399 --> 00:27:55,100
so repaired more collectively to
developing nations and we'd add more

507
00:27:55,100 --> 00:27:58,820
local content at 12 major problems with
developing nations even if they have

508
00:27:58,820 --> 00:27:59,820
collectively

509
00:27:59,820 --> 00:28:03,139
they're not necessarily gonna have local
content but you know these

510
00:28:03,139 --> 00:28:06,250
internationalized domain names could
perhaps maybe fix that were given

511
00:28:06,250 --> 00:28:09,159
incentives for people to develop local
content for

512
00:28:09,159 --> 00:28:13,880
areas like Botswana so we're gonna
possibly CT all these

513
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:17,050
having an effect on queries and

514
00:28:17,050 --> 00:28:20,090
if internet exchange point spread
throughout the world then we're def

515
00:28:20,090 --> 00:28:21,370
gonna see an increase in in

516
00:28:21,370 --> 00:28:25,120
and connectivity and whether or not the
root servers can respond to that

517
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:26,210
increase

518
00:28:26,210 --> 00:28:30,090
I haven't seen de Donner also we talk
about

519
00:28:30,090 --> 00:28:33,810
the carnival game with digital archery
and

520
00:28:33,810 --> 00:28:36,950
some the bashing proposals reich amber

521
00:28:36,950 --> 00:28:40,580
we don't really know and I can hasn't
come out and said yet how many

522
00:28:40,580 --> 00:28:43,908
they're going to implement at a time
they would like it to be a kind of

523
00:28:43,909 --> 00:28:46,330
steady and slow process

524
00:28:46,330 --> 00:28:50,370
but we just don't know what I mean here
you have the situation where

525
00:28:50,370 --> 00:28:54,510
I can't policy I recommendations could
really have

526
00:28:54,510 --> 00:28:57,580
and technical impact on

527
00:28:57,580 --> 00:29:00,678
the way in which this is implemented in
room servers am

528
00:29:00,679 --> 00:29:04,919
and then also think about if you have if
you do have a whole bunch of new root

529
00:29:04,919 --> 00:29:06,840
servers at the sales are new deal these

530
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:11,010
into the router the same time none of
that information is going to be cached

531
00:29:11,010 --> 00:29:15,060
so if you have one thousand new TLDs
just going live than the root servers

532
00:29:15,060 --> 00:29:18,310
the day on which they go live we're
gonna have to respond to help a lot more

533
00:29:18,310 --> 00:29:20,010
queries and they're used to

534
00:29:20,010 --> 00:29:23,929
and can we come late this week we
haven't seen police I haven't seen

535
00:29:23,929 --> 00:29:27,889
anything on there and be system
diversity factor

536
00:29:27,889 --> 00:29:32,520
when I really only relates to combating
something like that the DoS attack n

537
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:36,040
on security which is better in hand to
software

538
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:40,020
but what if misinformation was
propagated in the root zone file that's

539
00:29:40,020 --> 00:29:41,179
going to affect

540
00:29:41,179 --> 00:29:46,080
the internet generally I'm and solar
system diversity factor I think

541
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:49,439
doesn't even come into play their point
I'm

542
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:53,790
and then the provisioning aspect the
accepting verifying and implementing

543
00:29:53,790 --> 00:29:55,210
changes to the root

544
00:29:55,210 --> 00:29:59,129
artist is also pertains to distributing
the updated zone piles

545
00:29:59,129 --> 00:30:03,149
I am so basically the religious workers
at

546
00:30:03,149 --> 00:30:07,270
you have and the and you have I can

547
00:30:07,270 --> 00:30:10,750
through the eye and a function getting
some kind of change request

548
00:30:10,750 --> 00:30:15,149
I and I would then go over to the NTIA
and the NTIA would say

549
00:30:15,149 --> 00:30:19,129
yes okay you can make that change
request they then communicate with

550
00:30:19,129 --> 00:30:21,550
Verisign is the root zone maintainer

551
00:30:21,550 --> 00:30:24,580
they make the change to the actual root
zone file

552
00:30:24,580 --> 00:30:29,100
sign up with the NSX and then send it
out to all the %ah researched all the

553
00:30:29,100 --> 00:30:30,500
root server operators

554
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:35,210
and then they have to distribute their
disseminated internally to make sure all

555
00:30:35,210 --> 00:30:37,720
their servers are up to date have the
most

556
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:41,600
readily available route server
information for for DNS lookups

557
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:46,010
um and so the issue really is is hearing
a thousand it heal these

558
00:30:46,010 --> 00:30:49,649
going to change this process is going to
cause some kinda breakdown

559
00:30:49,649 --> 00:30:53,619
and i cant came back and said no no no
no there's there's no threat to

560
00:30:53,619 --> 00:30:55,129
stability here

561
00:30:55,129 --> 00:30:59,530
am we can handle this because you know
we have the ability to scale down

562
00:30:59,530 --> 00:31:01,010
operations

563
00:31:01,010 --> 00:31:04,790
and is bizarrely they also said that

564
00:31:04,790 --> 00:31:08,928
the evaluation in new gTLD application
was really largest task

565
00:31:08,929 --> 00:31:13,080
and that's already under way but has a
absolutely nothing to do with root

566
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:14,490
server operations

567
00:31:14,490 --> 00:31:18,240
in my opinion I mean and less maybe what
they're considering was

568
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:22,470
well we'll prevent inadequate registries
from:

569
00:31:22,470 --> 00:31:25,950
I'm having access to the room whatsoever
flood

570
00:31:25,950 --> 00:31:29,570
but the new gTLD application operations
really just doesn't seem

571
00:31:29,570 --> 00:31:32,780
seem relevant to me and the propagation
zone files

572
00:31:32,780 --> 00:31:38,090
occurs right now twice a day and I can
leave their numbers not going to change

573
00:31:38,090 --> 00:31:41,950
and so really in terms of them
distribution list to do this really

574
00:31:41,950 --> 00:31:42,570
shouldn't be

575
00:31:42,570 --> 00:31:45,810
too much of a problem so also that

576
00:31:45,810 --> 00:31:49,230
the separation from his roots and from
the root zone maintain our VeriSign

577
00:31:49,230 --> 00:31:52,330
to the operators all throughout the
world is a as a pretty well established

578
00:31:52,330 --> 00:31:53,939
process

579
00:31:53,940 --> 00:31:58,179
I'm but there's other issues that
haven't been addressed

580
00:31:58,179 --> 00:32:02,330
for instance the INS to when they get
the first request

581
00:32:02,330 --> 00:32:05,359
to delegate a new TLD um

582
00:32:05,359 --> 00:32:09,460
they're gonna be required to submit a
report to the NTIA

583
00:32:09,460 --> 00:32:13,250
I'll be four any new deal the US
delegate it now

584
00:32:13,250 --> 00:32:17,129
how are they gonna handle a thousand
reports me know that Outlook even goes

585
00:32:17,129 --> 00:32:18,290
into these reports

586
00:32:18,290 --> 00:32:21,550
do they have to step into this is going
to cause a backlog

587
00:32:21,550 --> 00:32:27,280
um and more importantly I think in terms
of governance issues

588
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:31,080
and by the making policy decisions but
doubt

589
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:36,129
what can what can't go into a deal did
I'll into the router to present a name

590
00:32:36,129 --> 00:32:40,230
WTF informational purposes the people
that I and I don't necessarily agree

591
00:32:40,230 --> 00:32:41,859
with their adult sucks

592
00:32:41,859 --> 00:32:45,389
they don't think that the internet would
benefit from that were

593
00:32:45,389 --> 00:32:48,700
and a dot hacker dub freak they would
considered

594
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:53,940
need to be and Apple are too i cant
principles are really I and a function

595
00:32:53,940 --> 00:32:57,040
do they have the right to need to stop
that apps don't be im

596
00:32:57,040 --> 00:33:01,040
really big problem I am and then change
request

597
00:33:01,040 --> 00:33:04,658
also in I can is also assuming

598
00:33:04,659 --> 00:33:08,429
that change requests are gonna come and
changes to the root zone from

599
00:33:08,429 --> 00:33:12,399
our registries and heal the operators
usually only on average

600
00:33:12,399 --> 00:33:16,330
1 per year you know that so that's not
too burdensome

601
00:33:16,330 --> 00:33:20,879
but I think you know I can isn't used to
working with major corporate clients and

602
00:33:20,879 --> 00:33:24,520
34 percent above the applicants were da
brand

603
00:33:24,520 --> 00:33:30,270
on applications I think they do they may
see a major change in the type other

604
00:33:30,270 --> 00:33:32,720
accountability that is expected of them

605
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:36,139
having dealt with what a lot of
corporate clients there

606
00:33:36,139 --> 00:33:40,330
they can be very demanding people they
expected only expect a quick turnaround

607
00:33:40,330 --> 00:33:44,419
and because I can have the capacity to
basically

608
00:33:44,419 --> 00:33:48,460
sir now the world's corporations in
terms of root zone request

609
00:33:48,460 --> 00:33:51,669
and does this change the amount of times
that the root zone file has to be

610
00:33:51,669 --> 00:33:53,470
propagated

611
00:33:53,470 --> 00:33:57,980
and I think even more importantly am

612
00:33:57,980 --> 00:34:01,510
ICANN's security assessments related

613
00:34:01,510 --> 00:34:06,590
primarily to stability the stability and
the provisioning system in the stability

614
00:34:06,590 --> 00:34:08,429
of the root server operations

615
00:34:08,429 --> 00:34:12,168
but not necessarily about security in
the way in which people like you I would

616
00:34:12,168 --> 00:34:13,549
think about this

617
00:34:13,550 --> 00:34:17,379
album you know we have to think about
the system as a whole

618
00:34:17,379 --> 00:34:21,699
and the real fundamental question here
is Kennedy in a system be compromised by

619
00:34:21,700 --> 00:34:22,669
ames securities

620
00:34:22,668 --> 00:34:25,960
in the provisioning system so let me
mention before

621
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:29,330
this involves I am a communicating to
the US Department of Commerce

622
00:34:29,330 --> 00:34:33,520
via the NTIA the Department of Commerce
meeting the VeriSign Verisign then

623
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:35,599
communicating with the router operators

624
00:34:35,599 --> 00:34:39,020
and interjected into the mix of this are

625
00:34:39,020 --> 00:34:42,590
per year one thousand new top-level
domain operators

626
00:34:42,590 --> 00:34:46,929
now can you please communications
between any parties be compromise cannot

627
00:34:46,929 --> 00:34:48,570
be altered can they be spooked

628
00:34:48,570 --> 00:34:53,070
up many more details I think about this
process to really

629
00:34:53,070 --> 00:34:56,460
up make a a serious assessment of
whether

630
00:34:56,460 --> 00:34:59,770
this amount of change the root zone
could have a negative impact on the

631
00:34:59,770 --> 00:35:02,640
functioning of the domain name system

632
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:06,410
so we also saw another somewhat
troubling

633
00:35:06,410 --> 00:35:11,290
innovation in 2011 so I can has been
using an automated system for

634
00:35:11,290 --> 00:35:14,490
changes to the root zone for re a
routine changes

635
00:35:14,490 --> 00:35:18,230
stingers me I am a change request to its
Web aged

636
00:35:18,230 --> 00:35:21,770
teal the operators get a username and
password to log into this thing they

637
00:35:21,770 --> 00:35:23,369
make a change request

638
00:35:23,369 --> 00:35:28,930
I'm and then diana brings it NTIA in go
down a process again

639
00:35:28,930 --> 00:35:32,109
am but what i don't understand it also
is

640
00:35:32,109 --> 00:35:36,060
did our old he'll be operators now gonna
have access to the ski I am a change

641
00:35:36,060 --> 00:35:36,950
request

642
00:35:36,950 --> 00:35:39,819
and that's going to be a big problem in
a few if you're giving out a thousand

643
00:35:39,820 --> 00:35:42,890
user names and passwords to this thing
per year

644
00:35:42,890 --> 00:35:47,500
it's gonna be compromised you know
corporate america has been

645
00:35:47,500 --> 00:35:51,190
hadn't greatest track record when it
comes to securing user names and

646
00:35:51,190 --> 00:35:51,849
passwords

647
00:35:51,849 --> 00:35:56,109
I'm but not know that launched his real
but

648
00:35:56,109 --> 00:35:59,130
I'm so the other issue 2 is

649
00:35:59,130 --> 00:36:03,420
if this yeah I am a system becomes
unavailable then they're gonna go back

650
00:36:03,420 --> 00:36:04,150
to

651
00:36:04,150 --> 00:36:08,859
this kind of normal process the you know
somebody getting on the phone and via

652
00:36:08,859 --> 00:36:12,380
phone and fax and e-mail making a change
request a min

653
00:36:12,380 --> 00:36:16,130
is a gigantic potential for social
engineering an hour

654
00:36:16,130 --> 00:36:19,930
group on changes we really saw that I
mean maybe that's

655
00:36:19,930 --> 00:36:23,399
maybe that's what we'll do in two years
with the manual huh

656
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:28,150
monarch I'm not advocating madruga

657
00:36:28,150 --> 00:36:33,400
Butler I am so was given to conclusions
never for a second I think that

658
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:38,260
them in terms of operations and
provisioning I can was probably right

659
00:36:38,260 --> 00:36:42,000
%uh I don't think there's going to be a
major adverse effect to the domain name

660
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,040
system

661
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:48,170
%uh in that sense there probably is the
capacity to handle these changes

662
00:36:48,170 --> 00:36:51,390
um but what we don't know is you know

663
00:36:51,390 --> 00:36:55,180
held greater a greater extent have
internet connectivity in internet

664
00:36:55,180 --> 00:36:57,310
exchange points being added throughout
the world

665
00:36:57,310 --> 00:37:00,680
how the service could respond to
additional queries you know we're not

666
00:37:00,680 --> 00:37:01,740
sure about that

667
00:37:01,740 --> 00:37:04,940
we need more information about how the
steel these are gonna be delegated

668
00:37:04,940 --> 00:37:08,800
I'll medium more information about the
used change requests and how they're

669
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:10,960
going to handle changes will corporate
clients

670
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:14,680
and about how the communicative process
between these three day or four

671
00:37:14,680 --> 00:37:16,560
different agencies and

672
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:21,160
and players in the root zone are are
actually going to be secured

673
00:37:21,160 --> 00:37:25,420
so this is probably more a function
above i cant committee structure than

674
00:37:25,420 --> 00:37:26,780
anything else because

675
00:37:26,780 --> 00:37:30,910
am in other committees are basically
everything I can only have a very very

676
00:37:30,910 --> 00:37:32,359
now focus

677
00:37:32,359 --> 00:37:36,410
at this point it seems like the real
focus was to bility and I think that

678
00:37:36,410 --> 00:37:40,200
a.m. you know it will be up to people
like us maybe even through the public

679
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:41,070
comment process

680
00:37:41,070 --> 00:37:44,960
to make sure that I can really has a
handle on the security within the

681
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:47,590
process as well

682
00:37:47,590 --> 00:37:51,310
on and this is gonna have a a major
effect

683
00:37:51,310 --> 00:37:55,299
on how the internet is governed I'm

684
00:37:55,300 --> 00:37:59,640
net in the meantime into governs we're
really talking about when the coronation

685
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:03,009
are the technical infrastructure in a
policy that defines

686
00:38:03,010 --> 00:38:06,030
the way in which an infrastructure works
in amtrak's

687
00:38:06,030 --> 00:38:10,690
and so with 1,930 different applications

688
00:38:10,690 --> 00:38:14,290
you know the entrance dipping in a look
a lot different book you also have a lot

689
00:38:14,290 --> 00:38:15,040
more money

690
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:19,710
at stake in a lot more players in what
we have right now through I can is this

691
00:38:19,710 --> 00:38:21,630
multi-stakeholder process in

692
00:38:21,630 --> 00:38:25,780
mean by definition a more stakeholders
UN to a multi-stakeholder process the

693
00:38:25,780 --> 00:38:26,320
more

694
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:29,349
change is going to be affected so

695
00:38:29,349 --> 00:38:32,619
women who are the stakeholders right now

696
00:38:32,619 --> 00:38:36,640
I'll know I can as Fulham love acronyms
Deanna so

697
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:40,040
taxi CLSM they're all over the place the

698
00:38:40,040 --> 00:38:44,440
you know s back I'm would actually order

699
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:48,740
they're they're all over the world
himself but the people have historically

700
00:38:48,740 --> 00:38:51,430
been most active and i cant are people
who

701
00:38:51,430 --> 00:38:55,310
who near the bottom line affects so you
have the registry is your the

702
00:38:55,310 --> 00:38:57,099
registrar's you have the brand's

703
00:38:57,099 --> 00:39:00,820
and internet-based businesses search
engines you know those are the guys that

704
00:39:00,820 --> 00:39:01,170
are

705
00:39:01,170 --> 00:39:04,550
that have been and are the major players
and I can send

706
00:39:04,550 --> 00:39:08,369
these are the players admit they have
the means to send people to the ICANN

707
00:39:08,369 --> 00:39:11,280
meeting to curtail the world they have
the means to Bala

708
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:15,800
the somewhat slow moving policy
development process that I can has

709
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:20,160
concocted they have the means to submit
comments and and we participate in the

710
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:21,240
process

711
00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:25,540
so the interest is always accounted for
minor ships in Internet policy

712
00:39:25,540 --> 00:39:29,300
I'm and was very significant in terms of
the perspective on the wrestling world

713
00:39:29,300 --> 00:39:31,080
is that well this is really absurd

714
00:39:31,080 --> 00:39:35,098
Lee interest that are accounted for our
interests are the private sector

715
00:39:35,099 --> 00:39:39,160
and unit name is good reason for this
perhaps you know internet innovation and

716
00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:42,399
economic growth related thereto is
really gone hand in hand

717
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:45,790
and as we noted earlier well i cant core
objectives

718
00:39:45,790 --> 00:39:49,369
is to promote competition so I am

719
00:39:49,369 --> 00:39:52,960
this does no should come it's really no
surprise that the rest the world has

720
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:53,590
seen

721
00:39:53,590 --> 00:39:58,410
I can is really a a tool for business
and and the US government

722
00:39:58,410 --> 00:40:01,220
so pleased changing staple is really
going to be there gonna be national

723
00:40:01,220 --> 00:40:03,599
registries are going to be a bit
basically

724
00:40:03,599 --> 00:40:08,290
I am but thousands of new registry
operators who are a little bit so the

725
00:40:08,290 --> 00:40:09,490
Internet

726
00:40:09,490 --> 00:40:13,780
I'm knees are good da brands they're
gonna be you know industries are going

727
00:40:13,780 --> 00:40:15,420
to be communities and

728
00:40:15,420 --> 00:40:18,880
we also saw applications from I very
large pro

729
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:22,050
a large number just got generic terms of
people trying to

730
00:40:22,050 --> 00:40:25,359
to snatch up interest rate senator this

731
00:40:25,359 --> 00:40:29,400
corporation called Doughnuts Inc which
kinda came outta nowhere

732
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:35,380
they filed 307 gTLD applications it's a
pity 6.8 million dollar investment

733
00:40:35,380 --> 00:40:39,720
next on the lines Google who filed 100
monde applications

734
00:40:39,720 --> 00:40:44,560
I'm looks 80.7 million and top-level
domain holdings 1292

735
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:48,920
when you have other smaller investors
you know people who applied for 10-15

736
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:52,630
16 below that and a lot of these are
generic terms

737
00:40:52,630 --> 00:40:56,830
are there could be very very valuable
Internet real estate so

738
00:40:56,830 --> 00:41:00,299
who stands to really become very
powerful is this registry stakeholders

739
00:41:00,300 --> 00:41:03,250
group within I can itself known as
Reisig

740
00:41:03,250 --> 00:41:06,560
I'm LAN are set to become arguably the
most influential

741
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:10,060
stakeholder in the process so this

742
00:41:10,060 --> 00:41:13,869
is a little bit troubling because you I
think I can has been getting better at

743
00:41:13,869 --> 00:41:15,180
accounting for

744
00:41:15,180 --> 00:41:19,470
other people's voices am you see more
interaction with academia government

745
00:41:19,470 --> 00:41:22,440
private industry so they're really
trying to reach out to developing

746
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:24,890
nations during the new gTLD process

747
00:41:24,890 --> 00:41:29,040
standards affecting bodies like the idea
know that there'll never

748
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:32,740
this over belleza registries could
really affect

749
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:36,930
I'll blame which policy is made a minute
century could drown our

750
00:41:36,930 --> 00:41:40,129
the voices other stakeholders in the
process

751
00:41:40,130 --> 00:41:43,680
I'm and it could shift summer-like and
initiatives into more kinda

752
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:44,810
self-interested

753
00:41:44,810 --> 00:41:48,900
typeof endeavors I'm then you have to
really think about it i mean most of the

754
00:41:48,900 --> 00:41:49,770
applications

755
00:41:49,770 --> 00:41:55,180
came from the US and the EU I'm and in
terms of connectivity and and and the

756
00:41:55,180 --> 00:41:56,560
global reach of the Internet in

757
00:41:56,560 --> 00:42:00,880
the developing nations are just not
really represented in this process right

758
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:02,430
now

759
00:42:02,430 --> 00:42:05,810
Sodor some further concerns will let you
know

760
00:42:05,810 --> 00:42:09,950
Internet policy and free expression well
these are always been inextricably

761
00:42:09,950 --> 00:42:11,310
linked

762
00:42:11,310 --> 00:42:15,060
over this multi-stakeholder process to
indoor for to be meaningful and

763
00:42:15,060 --> 00:42:16,339
systematic 10

764
00:42:16,339 --> 00:42:20,250
and and 42 to still have some teeth we
really have to give a lot more

765
00:42:20,250 --> 00:42:21,800
consideration to how

766
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:26,339
developing nations in hell really the
the most important constituents internet

767
00:42:26,339 --> 00:42:27,420
users

768
00:42:27,420 --> 00:42:30,810
are going to be accounted for in this
process am

769
00:42:30,810 --> 00:42:33,930
and I think we really do need to
continue to think through

770
00:42:33,930 --> 00:42:37,450
all the implications are Internet policy
in government on things like free

771
00:42:37,450 --> 00:42:38,500
expression

772
00:42:38,500 --> 00:42:41,710
and and and innovation I am

773
00:42:41,710 --> 00:42:45,470
and really people let us I think have

774
00:42:45,470 --> 00:42:49,980
a almost no obligation to to become more
involved like and has constituents maybe

775
00:42:49,980 --> 00:42:53,359
even as a constituent organization

776
00:42:53,359 --> 00:42:57,190
so on we've talked about private
industry

777
00:42:57,190 --> 00:43:01,099
and their drama like an hour we see also
is another battle

778
00:43:01,099 --> 00:43:05,220
on the Internet Governance front all
stakeholders is private

779
00:43:05,220 --> 00:43:09,849
private industry essentially verses
nations I'm not sure if anybody has been

780
00:43:09,849 --> 00:43:11,520
following all this debate but

781
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:16,460
the International Telecommunications
Union which is really a branch of the UN

782
00:43:16,460 --> 00:43:19,490
is better and doing a lot of posturing

783
00:43:19,490 --> 00:43:22,890
%uh in terms of trying to take over some
Internet governance functions and we've

784
00:43:22,890 --> 00:43:24,129
already started to see

785
00:43:24,130 --> 00:43:27,849
some pushback from private industry
about us

786
00:43:27,849 --> 00:43:32,060
presence on May 24th been sir who was
one of the

787
00:43:32,060 --> 00:43:36,040
you know the the grandfathers on the
Internet in terms of developing the TCP

788
00:43:36,040 --> 00:43:39,859
IP protocol use Google's chief internet
evangelist renowned

789
00:43:39,859 --> 00:43:43,529
I manage the fantastic a fantastically
bright

790
00:43:43,530 --> 00:43:46,660
an articulate man I wrote an op-ed

791
00:43:46,660 --> 00:43:50,879
in the New York Times May 24th called
you know about keeping the internet open

792
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:54,730
um you know and it makes very clear the
private industry

793
00:43:54,730 --> 00:43:58,130
sees the multi-stakeholder model as
valuable to them because

794
00:43:58,130 --> 00:44:02,740
their voices heard their in did affects
their bottom line

795
00:44:02,740 --> 00:44:07,339
um and traditional regulatory functions
over the internet would really

796
00:44:07,339 --> 00:44:10,900
unit could beast stultifying or stifle

797
00:44:10,900 --> 00:44:14,060
slightly in terms of what they can do
what they can roll out

798
00:44:14,060 --> 00:44:18,440
so the multi-stakeholder model which
their gigantic part right now

799
00:44:18,440 --> 00:44:22,930
now they want to keep it that way I am
and there are a lot

800
00:44:22,930 --> 00:44:26,960
up on in a free speech in and innovation

801
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:30,990
and collaboration no implications and
listen

802
00:44:30,990 --> 00:44:34,619
and that's what private industry is
really all the arguments that there

803
00:44:34,619 --> 00:44:35,180
there

804
00:44:35,180 --> 00:44:38,109
they're bringing out to the forefront
and they definitely make sense and their

805
00:44:38,109 --> 00:44:38,759
coach in

806
00:44:38,760 --> 00:44:41,810
but we also have to remember that there
there's other interests

807
00:44:41,810 --> 00:44:46,529
and private industry at stake I mean you
saw this again in the the sober people

808
00:44:46,530 --> 00:44:50,180
to be and I'm know you have these
powerful Internet companies basically

809
00:44:50,180 --> 00:44:53,669
stuff standing up against the old guard
and here

810
00:44:53,670 --> 00:44:56,700
we have already know these powerful
Internet company sees powerful

811
00:44:56,700 --> 00:45:00,080
Giants have industry a.m.

812
00:45:00,080 --> 00:45:04,980
basically facing off against any kind
regulatory interjection in the Internet

813
00:45:04,980 --> 00:45:06,540
governance process

814
00:45:06,540 --> 00:45:09,750
and Absalom you know it's very telling
and I think it's something that we're

815
00:45:09,750 --> 00:45:12,359
going to continue to see so long as
anti-government

816
00:45:12,359 --> 00:45:16,009
is an area that's not really very very
well the final

817
00:45:16,010 --> 00:45:20,680
continues to be gray area so a little
back earlier I T U

818
00:45:20,680 --> 00:45:24,089
budget somewhat interesting is actually
establish a way back to the 19th century

819
00:45:24,089 --> 00:45:25,849
in 1865

820
00:45:25,849 --> 00:45:29,570
to facilitate amendments to something
called the International Telegraph

821
00:45:29,570 --> 00:45:30,359
convention

822
00:45:30,359 --> 00:45:33,799
in 1947 it became specialize in see the
UN

823
00:45:33,800 --> 00:45:37,310
and since 2003 they've been posturing to
get their hands

824
00:45:37,310 --> 00:45:40,680
involved and Internet governance through
something called the World Summit

825
00:45:40,680 --> 00:45:44,020
on the information society you first
meetings in geneva

826
00:45:44,020 --> 00:45:47,250
2003 in tunis and 2005

827
00:45:47,250 --> 00:45:51,710
um the interesting thing though is that
you know all these negotiations with the

828
00:45:51,710 --> 00:45:52,570
I do you

829
00:45:52,570 --> 00:45:57,480
the only people allowed I'm into the
process I nation-states

830
00:45:57,480 --> 00:46:00,540
there's no other stakeholders there is
some form

831
00:46:00,540 --> 00:46:04,609
a private I'm membership in the
organization but it is incredibly

832
00:46:04,609 --> 00:46:05,650
expensive I don't

833
00:46:05,650 --> 00:46:08,940
in between ten and fifteen thousand
dollars for membership in

834
00:46:08,940 --> 00:46:12,170
not every company and not every person
can

835
00:46:12,170 --> 00:46:15,220
can afford that kinda but kinda fishy so
there's

836
00:46:15,220 --> 00:46:19,180
193 States and everybody get a bill and
it's a majority

837
00:46:19,180 --> 00:46:22,270
that carries ago so what's scary about
that as you have

838
00:46:22,270 --> 00:46:27,650
nations like Syria and China and evoke
else just as much as the United States

839
00:46:27,650 --> 00:46:28,859
is the UK

840
00:46:28,859 --> 00:46:33,480
I'm right now I think there are fourteen
countries that are actively censoring

841
00:46:33,480 --> 00:46:34,440
the internet

842
00:46:34,440 --> 00:46:37,800
and that's growing all the time so a

843
00:46:37,800 --> 00:46:41,250
nation we're having nations

844
00:46:41,250 --> 00:46:45,220
and have some it while our nation have
some input into

845
00:46:45,220 --> 00:46:48,520
the Internet governance function is
carried to love people

846
00:46:48,520 --> 00:46:53,119
I'm MS is a private industry is really
bringing our so what's happening

847
00:46:53,119 --> 00:46:56,480
right now is that everyone is gearing up
for a meeting

848
00:46:56,480 --> 00:47:01,569
in Dubai in December and this is the
World Conference on international

849
00:47:01,569 --> 00:47:03,519
telecommunications regulations

850
00:47:03,519 --> 00:47:06,930
and what's going to happen eros they're
gonna amend these international

851
00:47:06,930 --> 00:47:10,609
telecommunications regulations they have
been amended since 1988

852
00:47:10,609 --> 00:47:14,069
annually with the pertain to our economy
interoperability

853
00:47:14,069 --> 00:47:18,509
love international telecommunications
equipment radio frequencies

854
00:47:18,510 --> 00:47:22,010
and facilities that kind of thing what

855
00:47:22,010 --> 00:47:25,049
you know that in a way which the i'd you
could become much more involved in

856
00:47:25,049 --> 00:47:26,519
internal government is it

857
00:47:26,519 --> 00:47:29,680
these are expanded into the scope
appearing arrangements

858
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:34,308
up the regulation of new technologies
data security and privacy requirements

859
00:47:34,309 --> 00:47:38,160
international standards for such things
and the protection of children

860
00:47:38,160 --> 00:47:41,868
which as we all know historically has
been a kinder

861
00:47:41,869 --> 00:47:45,990
under-represented in over censored
constituent over the Internet

862
00:47:45,990 --> 00:47:49,799
I'm until its potential for a lot of
censorship and there's a potential for

863
00:47:49,799 --> 00:47:52,029
dramatic changes in terms of policy in

864
00:47:52,029 --> 00:47:55,930
and I think they can really be
underestimated out because all of these

865
00:47:55,930 --> 00:47:57,839
have been proposals by member states

866
00:47:57,839 --> 00:48:01,049
so industry sees this well you know they
don't want to have

867
00:48:01,049 --> 00:48:04,740
these nation-states I'm interject

868
00:48:04,740 --> 00:48:09,220
essentially politics and diplomacy in
compromise into the Internet governance

869
00:48:09,220 --> 00:48:10,200
process

870
00:48:10,200 --> 00:48:13,799
they like the multi-stakeholder model
I'm I think which had best

871
00:48:13,799 --> 00:48:17,869
and entered a journal I'm sorry if the
protocol Journal article

872
00:48:17,869 --> 00:48:21,819
for a few years ago for was only a
lieutenant

873
00:48:21,819 --> 00:48:25,558
classifying there is criticism and all
that the Eid to you said

874
00:48:25,559 --> 00:48:29,329
it was accused of you know imposing
anachronistic in appropriate regulatory

875
00:48:29,329 --> 00:48:30,130
measures

876
00:48:30,130 --> 00:48:34,279
that stole to buy any formal innovation
and progress in telecommunications and

877
00:48:34,279 --> 00:48:38,950
quite will put but may be a bit
heavy-handed I'm

878
00:48:38,950 --> 00:48:42,470
and nations other nations around the
world they see I can with what I

879
00:48:42,470 --> 00:48:45,349
skepticism so they want to have their
voice heard me think they're always

880
00:48:45,349 --> 00:48:47,859
going to be better do something like the
idea you

881
00:48:47,859 --> 00:48:51,538
because I can it said California
not-for-profit corporation with direct

882
00:48:51,539 --> 00:48:52,250
ties

883
00:48:52,250 --> 00:48:55,990
the US Department of Commerce and US
industry and they see this

884
00:48:55,990 --> 00:49:00,440
that I can has been basically position
to maintain the US's

885
00:49:00,440 --> 00:49:05,769
advantageous am position with regard to
economic growth

886
00:49:05,769 --> 00:49:09,619
I'm and that they have for a while
Charlotte the involvement of other

887
00:49:09,619 --> 00:49:13,010
nations were turned a blind eye to
developing nations not been a bit of a

888
00:49:13,010 --> 00:49:14,470
problem

889
00:49:14,470 --> 00:49:17,470
so I think it really depends on your
perspective you see

890
00:49:17,470 --> 00:49:20,779
the Internet something like a public
utility

891
00:49:20,779 --> 00:49:24,279
there may be something that the public
has come to rely on

892
00:49:24,279 --> 00:49:27,480
than it actually kinda makes sense that
the Eid to you

893
00:49:27,480 --> 00:49:31,099
should be able to have some kind
regulatory function but the ironic

894
00:49:31,099 --> 00:49:35,170
I'm pointer that is really on a
consequence of that is that

895
00:49:35,170 --> 00:49:39,619
also pretend that their represents the
greatest potential for censorship

896
00:49:39,619 --> 00:49:44,000
I'm and if you see this is the the
Internet as a kind of decentralized

897
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:48,579
force with economic power then the
multi-stakeholder marlin and I cans

898
00:49:48,579 --> 00:49:53,099
am inclusion a private industry as the
the major stakeholders actually begins

899
00:49:53,099 --> 00:49:54,819
to make sense as well

900
00:49:54,819 --> 00:49:58,180
ok so I think we're we can take away
from this is that

901
00:49:58,180 --> 00:50:01,549
there's gonna be a great deal %uh riding

902
00:50:01,549 --> 00:50:05,210
on matters of internal governance that
we're gonna see no matter what

903
00:50:05,210 --> 00:50:08,260
some major changes to this
multi-stakeholder model of governance

904
00:50:08,260 --> 00:50:09,089
where

905
00:50:09,089 --> 00:50:13,450
new TLD registries are going to have a
very very powerful voice in the registry

906
00:50:13,450 --> 00:50:14,450
stakeholders group

907
00:50:14,450 --> 00:50:17,779
and become more more active throughout I
cam um

908
00:50:17,779 --> 00:50:22,599
and me have to ensure that normal
internet users is right it's in

909
00:50:22,599 --> 00:50:25,920
and I just got pushed to the wayside

910
00:50:25,920 --> 00:50:30,130
and you're also means he will maybe
after December we'll see what happens

911
00:50:30,130 --> 00:50:33,789
the Eid to you may have it end an
internal government soldiers we just

912
00:50:33,789 --> 00:50:36,369
don't know why didn't we do those
industries like to let this happen

913
00:50:36,369 --> 00:50:37,599
without a fight

914
00:50:37,599 --> 00:50:42,460
I M and I think it was almost a policy
very closely

915
00:50:42,460 --> 00:50:45,869
I M multi-stakeholder model however

916
00:50:45,869 --> 00:50:49,650
in my opinion it's actually served us
pretty well so far

917
00:50:49,650 --> 00:50:53,670
but I think you know her what really
matters is a.m.

918
00:50:53,670 --> 00:50:57,220
you know when any I do you gain some
government power not

919
00:50:57,220 --> 00:51:01,400
real stakeholders here and I think we
need to make our voice known

920
00:51:01,400 --> 00:51:05,099
we need to continue to have I think a
major impact on the way in which the

921
00:51:05,099 --> 00:51:07,319
Internet is governed and its ground in

922
00:51:07,319 --> 00:51:10,740
and we should all have a part in the
process

923
00:51:10,740 --> 00:51:13,980
and I think make should could give a lot
of thought to

924
00:51:13,980 --> 00:51:18,210
starting no a hacker based internet
registry

925
00:51:18,210 --> 00:51:21,890
and that's it for me go okay question

926
00:51:21,890 --> 00:51:26,129
when thank you very much

927
00:51:26,130 --> 00:51:29,289
mentioned I'm an attorney here in New
York but stepped ellen Johnson

928
00:51:29,289 --> 00:51:32,990
anybody with any follow-up questions on
mention today and how can I am

929
00:51:32,990 --> 00:51:36,640
feel free to reach out to me directly I
am

930
00:51:36,640 --> 00:51:39,980
I live in the West Village and I work in
Midtown somos around are you taking

931
00:51:39,980 --> 00:51:40,450
questions

932
00:51:40,450 --> 00:51:43,599
absolutely gay

933
00:51:43,599 --> 00:51:47,059
but i wanna be underrepresented groups
tonight United can seems to be the

934
00:51:47,059 --> 00:51:49,519
registrant's themselves

935
00:51:49,519 --> 00:51:53,750
a who when we think perhaps they should
benefit from this great expansion in the

936
00:51:53,750 --> 00:51:55,680
T on the space

937
00:51:55,680 --> 00:51:59,029
and another interesting group is the CCT
on these which are out of the process

938
00:51:59,029 --> 00:52:00,119
completely

939
00:52:00,119 --> 00:52:04,519
so you know any sort of risk to the
domain name system as a whole

940
00:52:04,519 --> 00:52:09,160
is often on the gTLD is the dot-com
zindagi mills in dotnet switcher

941
00:52:09,160 --> 00:52:12,490
arm regulated by I can but in that dot

942
00:52:12,490 --> 00:52:15,880
CNN dot I E N those

943
00:52:15,880 --> 00:52:18,950
Yes No I would appreciate your comments
on that

944
00:52:18,950 --> 00:52:22,799
another question is whether what the eye
to use really seeking

945
00:52:22,799 --> 00:52:26,839
is replacing the NTIA to sign the route

946
00:52:26,839 --> 00:52:31,009
because the NTIA has been political in
its choice I love

947
00:52:31,010 --> 00:52:35,269
delaying to sign certain route updates
like North Korean pulse I'm

948
00:52:35,269 --> 00:52:38,829
as my understanding absolute together
for a question I

949
00:52:38,829 --> 00:52:43,150
think I just agree with the registrant
do need to have a greater voice

950
00:52:43,150 --> 00:52:47,420
absolutely I'm with regard to the CCPO
the uppers the country code top-level

951
00:52:47,420 --> 00:52:48,660
domain operators

952
00:52:48,660 --> 00:52:53,038
it's interesting they're not really part
of the process but they do have the

953
00:52:53,039 --> 00:52:54,230
right to object to

954
00:52:54,230 --> 00:52:57,259
other domain names being delegated

955
00:52:57,259 --> 00:53:00,569
if they believe you know a gTLD
application is

956
00:53:00,569 --> 00:53:03,579
is confusingly similar to their own
extension

957
00:53:03,579 --> 00:53:07,150
they have the right to object to that in
a century knock out the application from

958
00:53:07,150 --> 00:53:08,119
the process

959
00:53:08,119 --> 00:53:12,230
so the extent to which they are going to
become major players in the

960
00:53:12,230 --> 00:53:16,150
an urgent appeal the application process
has yet to be seen

961
00:53:16,150 --> 00:53:19,349
we'll probably see them stepping up to
the plate in January in the end of the

962
00:53:19,349 --> 00:53:19,599
year

963
00:53:19,569 --> 00:53:22,799
objection period am and with regard to

964
00:53:22,799 --> 00:53:26,170
I am the ITU you replacing the NTIA

965
00:53:26,170 --> 00:53:30,200
you're probably absolutely right about
them num

966
00:53:30,200 --> 00:53:35,809
expression yes are so are my former
employer had about 17,000 must be parked

967
00:53:35,809 --> 00:53:38,210
domains to protect their trademark
petrolia

968
00:53:38,210 --> 00:53:43,369
mmm are and the expansion of the gTLD is
feels to me from that perspective

969
00:53:43,369 --> 00:53:46,589
to be a nice organized shakedown on
similar

970
00:53:46,589 --> 00:53:50,390
a a trademark holders to get them to
register

971
00:53:50,390 --> 00:53:54,430
yet more of these domains in the hundred
or thousand additional namespaces

972
00:53:54,430 --> 00:53:57,519
mmm I and the fact that I can is largely

973
00:53:57,519 --> 00:54:00,529
as it feels like a pile of registries
are

974
00:54:00,529 --> 00:54:04,190
our registrar registrars I'm sorry on it
and makes this

975
00:54:04,190 --> 00:54:07,279
some but they could fairly cynical view
of the whole process yes

976
00:54:07,279 --> 00:54:11,059
what's your take on to I can is there
some shakedown operator

977
00:54:11,059 --> 00:54:15,180
it it's been a major criticism other
programs that always depends the

978
00:54:15,180 --> 00:54:16,799
registrations are going to be afternoon

979
00:54:16,799 --> 00:54:22,019
my essentially be multiplied times the
number dodge in our to.the 09 existence

980
00:54:22,019 --> 00:54:26,019
and that's gonna cause %uh you know the
the major brands from

981
00:54:26,019 --> 00:54:29,279
to spend a whole lot more money than
they would otherwise have but they

982
00:54:29,279 --> 00:54:32,650
needed to combat that perception and
develop certain rights protection

983
00:54:32,650 --> 00:54:33,309
mechanisms

984
00:54:33,309 --> 00:54:36,509
that are inherent to the process now I
can is in the process

985
00:54:36,509 --> 00:54:39,789
as developing something called the
trademark Clearinghouse by which

986
00:54:39,789 --> 00:54:44,130
I am the individual anybody any
trademark owner can submit

987
00:54:44,130 --> 00:54:47,019
their mark to the trademark
Clearinghouse and if you're going to

988
00:54:47,019 --> 00:54:49,299
register domain within the TLD

989
00:54:49,299 --> 00:54:52,240
you gonna get a notice if there's a
direct hit but to match with that

990
00:54:52,240 --> 00:54:53,480
particular strain

991
00:54:53,480 --> 00:54:56,859
so then the I'm if you go forward with
it

992
00:54:56,859 --> 00:55:00,150
the on the train I could then get
another simpson

993
00:55:00,150 --> 00:55:04,130
so answer registered this domain and
then they could go forward with some

994
00:55:04,130 --> 00:55:04,740
kinda

995
00:55:04,740 --> 00:55:08,549
UDRP arrest process by which they either
disable the domain

996
00:55:08,549 --> 00:55:12,440
were transferred back to them if they
believe that their they have to

997
00:55:12,440 --> 00:55:16,170
but it doesn't negate the fact that they
do you still have to register these

998
00:55:16,170 --> 00:55:17,740
depends a registration

999
00:55:17,740 --> 00:55:22,049
and that's really more functional a the
history a trademark law

1000
00:55:22,049 --> 00:55:25,829
and the obligations for trademark
holders to enforce their rights

1001
00:55:25,829 --> 00:55:29,460
and but I rushing that shipped as well
so I think when there's a shift in

1002
00:55:29,460 --> 00:55:32,960
in the long run shit that cranes his
obligation

1003
00:55:32,960 --> 00:55:36,349
the defense for registrations will
probably decrease as well

1004
00:55:36,349 --> 00:55:40,109
no I think that I think a run-out I'm so
sorry but I'm I'm happy to questions

1005
00:55:40,109 --> 00:55:41,098
afterwards

1006
00:55:41,099 --> 00:55:46,000
thanks everyone for listening well
