1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:03,720
what a fun and I'm sorry we can still do
music crystal

2
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:09,750
so a continuous if you could bring the
music back up again

3
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:13,469
from people today there

4
00:00:13,469 --> 00:00:16,948
beginning to suspect so anyway we've got
Griffin boys here talk about hackers in

5
00:00:16,949 --> 00:00:17,980
the Arab Spring world

6
00:00:17,980 --> 00:00:24,680
running short but go already had been
healing hi

7
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:28,140
I'm so unfortunately because this is

8
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:32,239
you know a hacker conference and because
ignore on

9
00:00:32,238 --> 00:00:35,269
will go wrong I actually had my original
flight eaten

10
00:00:35,270 --> 00:00:39,250
and had to recreate these party last
night and partly today after like two or

11
00:00:39,250 --> 00:00:40,309
three hours asleep so

12
00:00:40,309 --> 00:00:45,968
adjusted on there will be slightly

13
00:00:45,969 --> 00:00:49,570
there these are slightly different than
I originally intended but you can still

14
00:00:49,570 --> 00:00:51,230
see the all the sources for this

15
00:00:51,230 --> 00:00:54,520
after the conference at a blog got
cryptic dot be

16
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:59,329
I'm you can also contact me by phone the
cake is a lie I don't actually answer it

17
00:00:59,329 --> 00:01:02,780
but I will call you back and you can see
me on Twitter at

18
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:07,310
that name and immortal words in my
computer on

19
00:01:07,310 --> 00:01:10,799
on suppress the morning if you live in
the background

20
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:13,950
on sorter you know not

21
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:18,030
that broad but what is censorship where
the idea is this reform censorship what

22
00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:20,020
makes people think that's a great idea

23
00:01:20,020 --> 00:01:23,740
on and we're sorry the differences in
society that makes it possible

24
00:01:23,740 --> 00:01:27,100
on depicting I want to point out is that
there's not

25
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:30,280
a massive difference between on

26
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:33,549
societies in the Middle East and say
societies in

27
00:01:33,549 --> 00:01:37,200
what's commonly called the West there's
not that much difference between America

28
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:38,090
and Egypt

29
00:01:38,090 --> 00:01:42,100
on people still the average person is is
roughly the same

30
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:46,060
they might be different religion maybe
or maybe not depending on who you are

31
00:01:46,060 --> 00:01:49,780
and they might do different things but
for the most part they have sort of a

32
00:01:49,780 --> 00:01:51,020
similar outlook but

33
00:01:51,020 --> 00:01:55,360
Michael ago intermission to go was a
social theorist

34
00:01:55,360 --> 00:02:00,119
1984 on you work in prison reform
critique major social structures like

35
00:02:00,119 --> 00:02:01,070
medicine

36
00:02:01,070 --> 00:02:04,159
is gay so is also passing by systems
control

37
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:07,350
system the ways that we are oppressed or
press ourselves

38
00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:13,780
on and so how is on punishment design
you know the apt to say hi to society's

39
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:16,270
according to for car which is the
disciplinary society in a society

40
00:02:16,270 --> 00:02:17,170
control

41
00:02:17,170 --> 00:02:20,959
in a disciplinary society you're
surrounded by the stop signs

42
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:24,550
and basically saying okay if you go past
this point that's bad

43
00:02:24,550 --> 00:02:28,020
and you can be severely punished and
it's very clear what the punishment is

44
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:29,660
and what the infraction is

45
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:35,180
on them very very well-defined rules
there also was called in close social

46
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:37,950
spaces so your social circle was mostly
a family

47
00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:41,730
extremely close friends I'm in very
small social circle

48
00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:46,420
and some sort outside body like state
organization dominates you as an

49
00:02:46,420 --> 00:02:47,040
individual

50
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:51,459
on that would be sorted think I've pre
nineteen fifties america

51
00:02:51,459 --> 00:02:54,970
where everything's very socially
hard-wired and

52
00:02:54,970 --> 00:02:57,970
if you step outside the boundaries you
could be horribly ostracized for ever

53
00:02:57,970 --> 00:03:02,400
and now it's not so much the case even
if you you know strip naked and

54
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:06,230
masturbating in the streets like I kinda
guy I think you're going to get over it

55
00:03:06,230 --> 00:03:12,738
on a society in control is what we live
in now

56
00:03:12,739 --> 00:03:15,940
where were self regulating the stop
signs are in our head

57
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:19,920
actually Johannes Grand Sport now who
has been

58
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:23,159
around and throughout the con has put us
in a really great way which is that

59
00:03:23,159 --> 00:03:28,090
I am you know sixty years ago if you
ever talked about masturbation

60
00:03:28,090 --> 00:03:31,459
people would say you know or don't do
that you're going to hell for that

61
00:03:31,459 --> 00:03:34,500
don't ever now this is something like

62
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:37,950
be responsible about your use a
masturbation

63
00:03:37,950 --> 00:03:41,549
at they rely on you to serve
self-regulate

64
00:03:41,549 --> 00:03:44,860
and serve insinuate that something bad
will happen

65
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:48,700
in a really nonspecific fashion on

66
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:53,290
so there's been a lot of talk about
censorship getting past it

67
00:03:53,290 --> 00:03:56,920
on you moving through the certain
barriers to communication

68
00:03:56,920 --> 00:04:02,360
offer at this conference and on you know
the telecom town was absolutely amazing

69
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:06,629
and you know what I just my focus on is
stuff that was sorta organically

70
00:04:06,629 --> 00:04:10,640
created by Egyptians by Libyans by
Syrians

71
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:14,950
and other people in the Middle East on
but also to talk about the barriers to

72
00:04:14,950 --> 00:04:15,810
collaboration

73
00:04:15,810 --> 00:04:19,358
arm I think the biggest barrier to sorta

74
00:04:19,358 --> 00:04:23,549
by European or American collaboration
with people in Middle East is exoticism

75
00:04:23,550 --> 00:04:28,070
and you know to a large extent sorry
xenophobia racism bigotry

76
00:04:28,070 --> 00:04:31,820
and all these other factors that sort of
come into this and

77
00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:34,849
people to really emphasize this idea
that's

78
00:04:34,850 --> 00:04:38,900
you know they are so much different than
us

79
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:42,770
the day is really nebulous the ice is
really well defined as being me

80
00:04:42,770 --> 00:04:46,169
they're very different from me
specifically well

81
00:04:46,169 --> 00:04:49,099
my friends who live in America very
different from me and that's not a huge

82
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:50,060
barrier

83
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:54,710
on you know these are all adults many of
whom are extraordinarily well educated

84
00:04:54,710 --> 00:04:56,219
better educated than me

85
00:04:56,220 --> 00:04:59,690
on language barrier is less the better
than it used to be so I think that

86
00:04:59,690 --> 00:05:00,860
there's not a whole lot

87
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:05,430
reason to sort of have this I absurd us
versus them

88
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:09,770
arm we would never break through this
this cultural barrier

89
00:05:09,770 --> 00:05:12,770
I don't think that that's actually up a
couple as it might have been insane

90
00:05:12,770 --> 00:05:16,590
the forties or fifties especially with
the internets with mass media

91
00:05:16,590 --> 00:05:19,699
with broad-scale print regular print

92
00:05:19,699 --> 00:05:24,620
writings now on on the other into the
going is also suspicion because we have

93
00:05:24,620 --> 00:05:27,310
a really terrible foreign policy
typically

94
00:05:27,310 --> 00:05:31,610
on the EU's foreign policy and regards
to the Middle East is for improving

95
00:05:31,610 --> 00:05:35,570
the US maybe not so much but

96
00:05:35,570 --> 00:05:38,979
so ever we get better with a little bit
suspicion you know it's kind of amazing

97
00:05:38,979 --> 00:05:39,750
because

98
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:43,120
you know if you meet me in the US and
you know you're sort of like there's no

99
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,120
way

100
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:48,509
this guy ever worked for the CIA

101
00:05:48,509 --> 00:05:52,009
but you know if you don't know that much
about

102
00:05:52,009 --> 00:05:55,430
what people to see a look like her have
the interact with others or

103
00:05:55,430 --> 00:05:59,449
their position in society on you might
actually think that

104
00:05:59,449 --> 00:06:04,050
arm if you've never seen someone who
actually work for the CIA before

105
00:06:04,050 --> 00:06:07,020
you might actually think that this
random westerner who wants to be all up

106
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:07,810
in your business

107
00:06:07,810 --> 00:06:10,970
is really working for the CIA or

108
00:06:10,970 --> 00:06:15,080
you know is the release Israeli spy or
anything in my five

109
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:21,060
ominous also sanctions it's really
really really difficult to go to Libya

110
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:25,009
if you're American were from the UK
because their sanctions in place you can

111
00:06:25,009 --> 00:06:26,970
actually get into serious trouble for
that kid he

112
00:06:26,970 --> 00:06:30,949
huge huge fines if you actually
suspected doing anything you know

113
00:06:30,949 --> 00:06:34,680
nebulous Lee bad it could actually be
quite bad when we get back to the US

114
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:38,000
so I think that's really a huge barrier

115
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,300
but more so it's sorta this idea that
people are two different from each other

116
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:44,130
which i think is bullshit

117
00:06:44,130 --> 00:06:47,719
arm so I just want to get in and talk to
talk about internet were

118
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:53,630
internet-related items and then going to
what happens when the internet goes away

119
00:06:53,630 --> 00:06:57,270
on the first one is toward and I love
towards like

120
00:06:57,270 --> 00:07:00,830
if I were to his boyfriend would be
sitting by the fire you can find do

121
00:07:00,830 --> 00:07:05,469
but it's not perfect it's not did not
attend a share

122
00:07:05,470 --> 00:07:09,400
its in some places really easily blocked
just by

123
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:12,810
you know making huge list a entry nodes

124
00:07:12,810 --> 00:07:16,150
trying to hunt down all the bridges on
UB's private bridges

125
00:07:16,150 --> 00:07:21,590
answered get past that a bit it works in
some countries doesn't work and others

126
00:07:21,590 --> 00:07:25,229
some countries actually instituted deep
packet inspection like Siri is done that

127
00:07:25,229 --> 00:07:28,550
in an effort to blocked or on a lot of
them just finance

128
00:07:28,550 --> 00:07:31,770
easier just to turn off the internet by

129
00:07:31,770 --> 00:07:36,210
on any huge society like china it's very
easy to block to or because they've got

130
00:07:36,210 --> 00:07:39,380
sixty thousand people working on it day
and night

131
00:07:39,380 --> 00:07:44,750
and it's really difficult to be you know
one of the twenty thirty people at tour

132
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:49,080
trying to sort of break past that and

133
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:52,039
somehow they managed to do it and I
think that it's really a huge credit to

134
00:07:52,039 --> 00:07:52,750
them

135
00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:55,199
the huge credit to their ability to
think around this problem in their

136
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:58,139
constantly constantly fighting this
order

137
00:07:58,139 --> 00:08:01,520
weird internet arms race

138
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:05,370
its relatively easy to use I'm several
years ago I was trying to teach people

139
00:08:05,370 --> 00:08:06,830
how to use it and is

140
00:08:06,830 --> 00:08:09,949
extremely difficult for the average
person sorta wrap their head around

141
00:08:09,949 --> 00:08:13,360
and very technical and had have what
noted pronounce I'm now they have a

142
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:14,169
browser bundle

143
00:08:14,169 --> 00:08:17,719
its two clicks and your using the Tor
network on

144
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:21,139
and if you are blocked you can use it
bridge even create private bridge

145
00:08:21,139 --> 00:08:23,889
and you can get around some others
blocks but not all if you're in a place

146
00:08:23,889 --> 00:08:26,930
like Pakistan where they're attempting
to block calls

147
00:08:26,930 --> 00:08:31,160
secure HTTPS traffic you might have a
really difficult time

148
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:35,269
actually breaking through that now
there's some ways to get around that

149
00:08:35,269 --> 00:08:35,820
like

150
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:39,060
using dialup internet using satellite
internet

151
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:43,289
but it's not perfect and you can really
rely on

152
00:08:43,289 --> 00:08:47,880
we're getting services are amazing on
their nearly impossible to censor which

153
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:50,630
is really difficult

154
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:53,980
a

155
00:08:53,980 --> 00:08:56,990
centering something is really easy if
you have controlled media

156
00:08:56,990 --> 00:09:00,399
so making something that's difficult or
impossible to censor

157
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:03,620
is a fetus or 212 itself and I think
that it's

158
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:06,709
really the most critical part love tore

159
00:09:06,709 --> 00:09:10,519
on not easily visible on the open web if
you

160
00:09:10,519 --> 00:09:14,560
type in the 16 digit string and put dot
onion after it

161
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:18,430
are you still have even if you remember
all that you still have to be

162
00:09:18,430 --> 00:09:21,470
on the Tor network even senior stuff on

163
00:09:21,470 --> 00:09:24,920
and some restrictions apply like if you
make a site and has like JavaScript

164
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:27,959
I'm you might find the people with the
browser but you can see anything

165
00:09:27,959 --> 00:09:31,519
just because it has JavaScript disabled
by default on

166
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:34,860
so it is revolutionary it is amazing
everyone should use it should learn how

167
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:36,380
to use it because it takes

168
00:09:36,380 --> 00:09:41,189
10 minutes to learn probably five
minutes for this proud and

169
00:09:41,190 --> 00:09:43,860
if you really need to get a message out
there want to be totally in on a mission

170
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:44,430
that

171
00:09:44,430 --> 00:09:48,220
you can do it and for basically no money

172
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:51,630
ATP its to resign your routing

173
00:09:51,630 --> 00:09:55,180
ATP is garlic routing extremely similar

174
00:09:55,180 --> 00:09:59,100
but it's something here in practice arm
it's not as well-known

175
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:02,420
so getting enough people to use it
together to make it

176
00:10:02,420 --> 00:10:07,329
difficult to block is sir difficult than
ever itself it's almost a non-starter

177
00:10:07,329 --> 00:10:11,670
on so really promoted but some people
use it and some people find it easier to

178
00:10:11,670 --> 00:10:13,569
use some people don't

179
00:10:13,570 --> 00:10:17,420
onto the you quit education and
awareness event are lacking

180
00:10:17,420 --> 00:10:21,170
but the documentation is starting to
come together

181
00:10:21,170 --> 00:10:24,880
it's not as high-tech was used to be but
it still you still have a very good

182
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:28,279
grass for the Internet in order to use
it

183
00:10:28,279 --> 00:10:33,160
on what do people live stream protests
you see that with Occupy Oakland Occupy

184
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:34,980
Wall Street due to an extent

185
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:38,279
Occupy Philly does it Billy I am

186
00:10:38,279 --> 00:10:43,570
but but its really easy to pinpoint the
location

187
00:10:43,570 --> 00:10:47,100
if you're in downtown Oakland you can
just watch the stream and be like any

188
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:49,500
idea where that's at I get my bagels
every day

189
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:52,570
you know and that's the same at it
completely applies even if you're in

190
00:10:52,570 --> 00:10:53,779
harm's Syria

191
00:10:53,779 --> 00:10:57,980
doing okay that's where to buy bagels
everyday home

192
00:10:57,980 --> 00:11:00,990
and so if your government agent be like
okay well they're like 10 feet from

193
00:11:00,990 --> 00:11:01,450
there

194
00:11:01,450 --> 00:11:04,730
every day why don't we just bomb this
place

195
00:11:04,730 --> 00:11:07,420
and while that sounds sort of like
outrage in the people do it people

196
00:11:07,420 --> 00:11:08,920
actually die in this way

197
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:12,329
on syrian activists romney also yet died
after

198
00:11:12,329 --> 00:11:15,890
live streaming on these bombings in
Syria eventually bombing came to his

199
00:11:15,890 --> 00:11:16,339
house

200
00:11:16,339 --> 00:11:20,560
and he was killed on so you really have
to weigh the risks and words if that

201
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:21,829
especially if you're

202
00:11:21,829 --> 00:11:25,620
in the Middle East and undergoing
surgery revolutionary process it's not

203
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:29,230
a safe environment and you can get
seriously injured killed

204
00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:32,760
et cetera so that's what they're
actually looking at

205
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:36,350
but you know the sort a bonus I bit like

206
00:11:36,350 --> 00:11:40,269
to use any of this to use you know
distributed systems like the ass for our

207
00:11:40,269 --> 00:11:41,680
Twitter or Facebook

208
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:45,279
or are trying to collaborate using
anything trying to clever using you know

209
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:48,820
yahoo games which people do because
they're not block in one place is

210
00:11:48,820 --> 00:11:52,360
arm to do all that you need the Internet

211
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:55,839
and if you don't have the Internet in
the first place whether using a

212
00:11:55,839 --> 00:11:59,860
a proxy or IT Peart or is not a
discussion you need to have because they

213
00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:00,339
can

214
00:12:00,339 --> 00:12:03,709
once they turn it up you're done so

215
00:12:03,709 --> 00:12:07,360
if you're relying on his services to get
the word out and connect and work in

216
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:09,779
these areas where this revolutionary
process going on

217
00:12:09,779 --> 00:12:12,810
your super fucked you're totally just
totally fucked

218
00:12:12,810 --> 00:12:16,720
on so what happens when they go away
well

219
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:20,310
your phone service people call each
other on a lot of these countries they

220
00:12:20,310 --> 00:12:21,040
didn't have

221
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:25,300
that large a surveillance process like
we have in the US right now

222
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:28,800
arm so it's not as easy for them to
serve ale a large portion of population

223
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:30,690
like it is in the US

224
00:12:30,690 --> 00:12:34,480
on nearly 100 percent Libyans had cell
phone her heads

225
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:37,570
phone service I'm 6.1 million users

226
00:12:37,570 --> 00:12:42,130
in the country eighty percent them had
cell phones that's a really huge number

227
00:12:42,130 --> 00:12:45,570
on and its me absolutely massive
percentage people whenever you think

228
00:12:45,570 --> 00:12:46,839
about it

229
00:12:46,839 --> 00:12:50,790
so it's difficult to surveilling
everyone its easier just to shut down

230
00:12:50,790 --> 00:12:51,839
the telephone service

231
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:55,279
if you realize that you know a hundred
thousand people are using it

232
00:12:55,279 --> 00:13:01,920
to connect and to maybe throw overthrow
the government

233
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:06,870
so dial-up internet

234
00:13:06,870 --> 00:13:10,339
assuming that you have phone service arm

235
00:13:10,339 --> 00:13:13,339
you can actually connect things you can
get online

236
00:13:13,339 --> 00:13:17,529
you can payout rages international
calling rates

237
00:13:17,529 --> 00:13:21,300
for them for the joy a 56k modem at best

238
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:26,029
and people do until the comics ran
incredibly successful campaign

239
00:13:26,029 --> 00:13:29,800
during the Egyptian revolution to get
people online to get them

240
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:33,430
access to this information because if
you're constantly surrounded by

241
00:13:33,430 --> 00:13:34,829
disinformation

242
00:13:34,829 --> 00:13:38,070
you just literally don't know and it
sounds completely simplistic and

243
00:13:38,070 --> 00:13:39,190
everything like that

244
00:13:39,190 --> 00:13:42,110
but if you really don't know you just
don't know and you don't have anything

245
00:13:42,110 --> 00:13:43,339
to compare it to STATS

246
00:13:43,339 --> 00:13:47,519
incredibly powerful one person can get
online and share this information with

247
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:49,500
all their friends or their families

248
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:52,949
and it can get out on they can share
with their friends or they can broadcast

249
00:13:52,949 --> 00:13:54,250
on pirate radio

250
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:58,279
they can print out flyers they can fax
people locally and so it's really sort

251
00:13:58,279 --> 00:13:59,649
of an amazing tool

252
00:13:59,649 --> 00:14:04,190
and its really difficult to you bring
people together in this way without the

253
00:14:04,190 --> 00:14:05,550
power of the Internet

254
00:14:05,550 --> 00:14:10,170
arm public ways got a popular

255
00:14:10,170 --> 00:14:13,110
I'm so it's okay okay well what happens
when the government gets wise initials

256
00:14:13,110 --> 00:14:14,130
of monster

257
00:14:14,130 --> 00:14:17,699
okay well plaintiff wailing arm

258
00:14:17,699 --> 00:14:21,070
followed by p followed by pirate radio
would seem

259
00:14:21,070 --> 00:14:25,220
I'm huge projects involving pirate radio
have undergone

260
00:14:25,220 --> 00:14:29,250
Egypt this one was actually partly
east-west collaboration

261
00:14:29,250 --> 00:14:32,269
and i cant about the name the people
that were involved

262
00:14:32,269 --> 00:14:35,750
on but it was absolutely widespread they
had to you

263
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:39,110
on make the parts make them other words
themselves

264
00:14:39,110 --> 00:14:42,420
peace all this together and then
pretending he's a lease

265
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:45,360
you know broadcast will package and then
until a very thing else you have to

266
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:46,360
build the Towers

267
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:50,149
and put everything together and you
locate tools

268
00:14:50,149 --> 00:14:53,230
locally and make it work whenever you
don't have the tools and

269
00:14:53,230 --> 00:14:56,750
so it's just amazing it is technically
illegal

270
00:14:56,750 --> 00:14:59,860
but the upside is that no one cares
because its revolution

271
00:14:59,860 --> 00:15:04,399
so its impossible to regulate
post-revolution

272
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:07,709
now that they're you not know that they
have a new president and

273
00:15:07,709 --> 00:15:10,829
you know they're looking at various
governments

274
00:15:10,829 --> 00:15:14,000
changes and things like that they still
don't really care

275
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,699
and the penalties are really minor you
might get a little fine

276
00:15:17,699 --> 00:15:21,660
you know atm absolute maximum maybe I
get like a few days in jail and it's not

277
00:15:21,660 --> 00:15:23,079
that big a deal to them

278
00:15:23,079 --> 00:15:27,010
cuz it's so much more important to have
this free and open area for their

279
00:15:27,010 --> 00:15:28,439
opinion to be a

280
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:32,019
released on to any verb

281
00:15:32,019 --> 00:15:35,639
even bigger extent I really was a big
deal in Libya

282
00:15:35,639 --> 00:15:39,089
on and actually was credited with
helping overthrow the government because

283
00:15:39,089 --> 00:15:40,019
once they had

284
00:15:40,019 --> 00:15:44,480
restricted the media entirely on the
pirate radio was the only way that you

285
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:47,050
can get out an anti-gaddafi message

286
00:15:47,050 --> 00:15:50,970
and so in early 2001 are 2 2011

287
00:15:50,970 --> 00:15:55,620
Radio Free Liberty began Libya began
broadcasting solidarity messages news

288
00:15:55,620 --> 00:16:00,100
revolutionary updates updates on just
random stuff and they would time it

289
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:03,370
really specifically so that they would
hopefully not get shut down

290
00:16:03,370 --> 00:16:07,860
on there's lots of speculation that the
big guys he transmitter came from radio

291
00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:10,490
North Sea which is sort of this
legendary

292
00:16:10,490 --> 00:16:15,070
pirate radio station operated up you
know above europe for like five years

293
00:16:15,070 --> 00:16:16,149
they made a movie about it

294
00:16:16,149 --> 00:16:19,329
it was terrible and down

295
00:16:19,329 --> 00:16:23,269
you know they'd ever say yes or no but
Dhabi but it was sold to Libya

296
00:16:23,269 --> 00:16:27,570
back in like nineteen seventy-seven so
maybe

297
00:16:27,570 --> 00:16:31,199
com and discovered most in northern
Libya which actually faces the sea

298
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:34,910
so the part that's more inland they
didn't quite didn't quite make it

299
00:16:34,910 --> 00:16:40,500
but after a while actually added a bunch
of different

300
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:43,670
radio stations but the bench guys he and
further south in the

301
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:47,050
country and even you know some

302
00:16:47,050 --> 00:16:50,149
some that had use programming him online
and

303
00:16:50,149 --> 00:16:52,860
these are all still pirate radio
stations just because they were from the

304
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:54,750
government doesn't mean that they're
going to go down and

305
00:16:54,750 --> 00:16:58,750
you know pay money and fill out
paperwork and get this all set up and

306
00:16:58,750 --> 00:17:03,290
yes they're just going to just keep
doing it forever basically

307
00:17:03,290 --> 00:17:06,569
so them so

308
00:17:06,569 --> 00:17:09,639
be there were if you really want to get
interested in pirate radio or regular

309
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:10,400
radio

310
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:13,669
or community radio where it's totally
legal and you can broadcast within the

311
00:17:13,669 --> 00:17:16,150
law and not have to pay a lot of money
to do so

312
00:17:16,150 --> 00:17:19,319
you can actually go online and check up
free radio .org

313
00:17:19,319 --> 00:17:22,438
or permit his radio dot word which is
actually based in Philadelphia and

314
00:17:22,439 --> 00:17:23,459
they're really cool people

315
00:17:23,459 --> 00:17:26,500
so arm

316
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:30,270
Bluetooth local networks their weapons a
mass distribution

317
00:17:30,270 --> 00:17:34,820
I have you know several hundred Syrian
videos that were taken with mobile

318
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:35,889
phones

319
00:17:35,890 --> 00:17:39,600
on my hard drive it home and the way
that they got out

320
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:43,990
wise Syrian mobile phones creating a
local network

321
00:17:43,990 --> 00:17:47,020
on sending them to find 12.2 phone

322
00:17:47,020 --> 00:17:50,350
and they didn't have access to sell your
network

323
00:17:50,350 --> 00:17:54,129
so what's the point in doing that well
if there's hundreds have you

324
00:17:54,130 --> 00:17:58,059
and hundreds if you have a copy of it
eventually wanna be will get cell

325
00:17:58,059 --> 00:17:58,520
service

326
00:17:58,520 --> 00:18:02,330
somewhere are eventually awfully and hit
cell tower somewhere

327
00:18:02,330 --> 00:18:05,699
eventually you know the saucers which
has come on briefly and you can up with

328
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:06,590
these things

329
00:18:06,590 --> 00:18:10,010
and it's incredibly powerful tool arm
and

330
00:18:10,010 --> 00:18:15,510
incredibly underused I think but

331
00:18:15,510 --> 00:18:18,039
but just large for ways that you can
make this happen and I think that it's

332
00:18:18,039 --> 00:18:21,780
kinda important for people to know that
it's not

333
00:18:21,780 --> 00:18:25,879
just holy bleeding totally you know lost
a few is the internet so

334
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:30,330
the Bluetooth mobile network om there's
sort of a new concept it's

335
00:18:30,330 --> 00:18:34,879
a synchronous mesh which is that
basically sort of like a local BBS

336
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:38,400
you actually connect to the network

337
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:42,280
you uploader you download news and then
you go on your merry way

338
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:46,620
and the network itself only connects to
the internet for like five minutes a day

339
00:18:46,620 --> 00:18:50,380
and will distribute stop at that time
and will retrieve news at that time

340
00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:53,380
so more difficult to pinpoint in terms

341
00:18:53,380 --> 00:18:58,100
location if you have you know dialup
internet or something like that

342
00:18:58,100 --> 00:19:02,340
or you're just doing it totally locally
on in this could actually work because

343
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:03,510
its mesh network

344
00:19:03,510 --> 00:19:07,419
and you don't need to be connected to it
by numbers in the time

345
00:19:07,419 --> 00:19:11,309
and then there's also BBS is I heard
legends and tales

346
00:19:11,309 --> 00:19:16,399
PBS's in cairo they were super bright
backed it back to life after everything

347
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:17,590
sort of went down except

348
00:19:17,590 --> 00:19:21,289
phone service and I think this is a
really cool idea and it's a lot more

349
00:19:21,289 --> 00:19:25,360
applicable band you know that a secret
as match which is a new buzzword it

350
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:26,380
sounds cool

351
00:19:26,380 --> 00:19:30,880
its it's not there yet but we can make a
BBS like tonight

352
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:34,850
so it's really easy to do and on

353
00:19:34,850 --> 00:19:38,020
so yeah

354
00:19:38,020 --> 00:19:41,840
and that most vivid honestly you know
we've got print media

355
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:45,639
we've got people distributing flyers a
lot of it is word of mouth

356
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:49,130
on a lot of it is simply door to door to
door to door and

357
00:19:49,130 --> 00:19:54,610
arm you know I think that people need to
realize its not necessarily something

358
00:19:54,610 --> 00:19:56,539
that requires the Internet

359
00:19:56,539 --> 00:19:59,910
it's like %um organizing in the Middle
East is not super different than

360
00:19:59,910 --> 00:20:01,200
organizing in the US

361
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:04,500
might go to someone's house it somehow
missed drink some wine

362
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:07,710
come up with a plan and then tomorrow
going to protest

363
00:20:07,710 --> 00:20:11,760
so I think that with that I'm actually
just gonna open it up to the Florida

364
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:13,809
super super super short but

365
00:20:13,809 --> 00:20:16,990
we did have to remake beasley this
morning so

366
00:20:16,990 --> 00:20:19,679
i think im just gonna open up for
questions and if there's something I

367
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:21,100
didn't cover it in governor

368
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:25,919
let me know and we can just talk about
it

369
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:29,830
I thanks and good job on last-minute
slightly making

370
00:20:29,830 --> 00:20:32,990
thank you it's kind of a specialty at at
this point frankly

371
00:20:32,990 --> 00:20:37,429
it's not something you wanna go to no
have a question about what the actual

372
00:20:37,429 --> 00:20:40,919
user needs are so you kept talking about
you know information and disinformation

373
00:20:40,919 --> 00:20:43,090
and things getting out

374
00:20:43,090 --> 00:20:46,689
white information did people

375
00:20:46,690 --> 00:20:50,270
inside these countries actually want
from the outside world

376
00:20:50,270 --> 00:20:54,289
from their peers what's that what's the
information

377
00:20:54,289 --> 00:20:57,650
autonomous regional on people in region
A

378
00:20:57,650 --> 00:21:02,000
are people in city a are getting news
from CB CB could be getting shelled

379
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,090
every day

380
00:21:03,090 --> 00:21:06,360
& CTA will never hear about it because
it's never on the local media on

381
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:09,020
and they can't connect to the internet
and they're literally waiting for

382
00:21:09,020 --> 00:21:09,860
someone to

383
00:21:09,860 --> 00:21:12,909
you effectively drive their car from the
town to be like yeah we just got blown

384
00:21:12,909 --> 00:21:14,809
to smithereens like two days ago

385
00:21:14,809 --> 00:21:19,120
and arm its really we want to know

386
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:23,250
how our families how r arm how are
people that we know

387
00:21:23,250 --> 00:21:27,770
you know what can we do to help has got
is this going our way are we the only

388
00:21:27,770 --> 00:21:29,860
town left is still having a revolution

389
00:21:29,860 --> 00:21:34,010
is this is the tide turning on salami is
really hyper local

390
00:21:34,010 --> 00:21:37,210
on a broader scale people are sorted you
know the the

391
00:21:37,210 --> 00:21:40,830
not necessarily need to know is like how
are things going in the UK

392
00:21:40,830 --> 00:21:43,889
on what's the weather gonna be like you
know stuff like that is

393
00:21:43,890 --> 00:21:47,370
is really critical they need some cyber
tethering to their families and their

394
00:21:47,370 --> 00:21:48,090
friends

395
00:21:48,090 --> 00:21:51,530
and then also to some extent you know
outside their countries outside the

396
00:21:51,530 --> 00:21:52,250
region's

397
00:21:52,250 --> 00:21:57,490
on because I think that we we serve have
these you know

398
00:21:57,490 --> 00:22:00,480
being attached to a friends or family is
extremely important but you know West

399
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:02,120
Indies creature comforts like

400
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:06,440
being able to talk to people that maybe
we know overseas reach out where

401
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:09,789
you playing games maybe in all this
little sup that arm

402
00:22:09,789 --> 00:22:12,780
muster was really take for granted but
once you haven't had it for like a month

403
00:22:12,780 --> 00:22:13,399
or two

404
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:20,400
it's really hard so I'm she say that

405
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:23,590
what about more conventional new sources
like

406
00:22:23,590 --> 00:22:26,709
all TV would be the big one because I'm

407
00:22:26,710 --> 00:22:30,580
there are channels that I used and I
think that

408
00:22:30,580 --> 00:22:35,110
probably been you somewhere just because
the the number things going on

409
00:22:35,110 --> 00:22:38,870
yen also you with any if these come

410
00:22:38,870 --> 00:22:42,010
but less convenience and I was told I
wanna

411
00:22:42,010 --> 00:22:46,150
greatest things out pretty good to
convene easy to use

412
00:22:46,150 --> 00:22:49,669
and how much

413
00:22:49,669 --> 00:22:54,240
how much worse is this then

414
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:58,679
you would be if government so happy you
have free speech

415
00:22:58,679 --> 00:23:02,010
well I think the real problem with on
with television is it

416
00:23:02,010 --> 00:23:05,900
in most countries it actually they have
sort of a structure similar to the BBC

417
00:23:05,900 --> 00:23:07,860
but with a dictatorship

418
00:23:07,860 --> 00:23:11,059
where ultimately one organization
controls

419
00:23:11,059 --> 00:23:14,418
who gets on television and who gets what
voice and you know

420
00:23:14,419 --> 00:23:18,580
structured in a way that we only want
these talking points and we absolutely

421
00:23:18,580 --> 00:23:20,830
cannot stand these talking points

422
00:23:20,830 --> 00:23:23,730
namely that we don't want anyone on to
come under state television that says

423
00:23:23,730 --> 00:23:25,690
whatever the state

424
00:23:25,690 --> 00:23:28,880
because we're the ones operate a
television station arm

425
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:32,250
you know in some cases they've actually
taken over the television station by

426
00:23:32,250 --> 00:23:35,690
you know I think that's really rare and
I don't think that you can actually

427
00:23:35,690 --> 00:23:37,240
really make that happen

428
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:42,809
again and again and again and i think
thats replicable in that way

429
00:23:42,809 --> 00:23:46,820
for stuff are there really real bagels
in the Middle East

430
00:23:46,820 --> 00:23:50,178
oh yeah that sucks I and then

431
00:23:50,179 --> 00:23:53,279
on I heard

432
00:23:53,279 --> 00:23:56,820
that a lotta resend why organism

433
00:23:56,820 --> 00:24:00,720
by organizing successful in the Middle
East because people men in masks

434
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:06,580
daily and that they actually congregate
in large groups and got to talk to each

435
00:24:06,580 --> 00:24:07,158
other

436
00:24:07,159 --> 00:24:11,140
and I think that its here with that
allowed a technology

437
00:24:11,140 --> 00:24:15,539
no would happen if they turned it all
off and most of us don't have places

438
00:24:15,539 --> 00:24:22,539
that we go to Tim me our entire
community must do anything or neighbors

439
00:24:23,070 --> 00:24:27,340
would say yes and no because its arm we
don't have anything where we're sort of

440
00:24:27,340 --> 00:24:28,270
socially

441
00:24:28,270 --> 00:24:31,440
obligated to go like which would be like
a church or mosque

442
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:35,120
on a missed you go to church I don't but
you know so you guys do definitely

443
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:38,659
and what you'll notice if you go to
church is that not everyone who simply

444
00:24:38,659 --> 00:24:40,010
complete you

445
00:24:40,010 --> 00:24:43,220
so while it's true that some people
organized in mosques a lot of people

446
00:24:43,220 --> 00:24:44,570
organized in houses

447
00:24:44,570 --> 00:24:48,149
I'll you organize with a friend
organizing copy shops on

448
00:24:48,150 --> 00:24:51,799
you consider think about how if you
involve an occupying all

449
00:24:51,799 --> 00:24:55,730
or in another protest movement you know
how do you meet

450
00:24:55,730 --> 00:24:59,120
and that's actually how everyone needs
for the most part

451
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:03,450
arm it's not necessarily something where
everyone is going to meet at a Moscow

452
00:25:03,450 --> 00:25:04,779
everyone's going to church

453
00:25:04,779 --> 00:25:07,909
for on everyone's gonna meet at a coffee
shop

454
00:25:07,909 --> 00:25:11,159
everyone's gonna be sir different and
it's actually really good because it's

455
00:25:11,159 --> 00:25:12,309
hard to say okay we'll

456
00:25:12,309 --> 00:25:15,379
were closing this down because its
beloved radicals you know

457
00:25:15,380 --> 00:25:19,360
its its you know what more difficult if
you like what's its Gary's house

458
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:23,340
and they were gonna go to discover shop
dance coming over here and hang on the

459
00:25:23,340 --> 00:25:24,850
part for a while

460
00:25:24,850 --> 00:25:28,289
so yeah I mean it's yes but people do
organism must

461
00:25:28,289 --> 00:25:33,650
but guess organism world

462
00:25:33,650 --> 00:25:39,440
hi I was wondering arm how is that it
was the campaigns in the faxes

463
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:44,220
on to the Middle East I mean every word
that was let go

464
00:25:44,220 --> 00:25:47,510
campaign call paper storms and Elena

465
00:25:47,510 --> 00:25:50,669
by anonymous in there were listening
faxes to know

466
00:25:50,669 --> 00:25:54,340
to the comings and that up no account
stuff like that

467
00:25:54,340 --> 00:25:57,409
an offer me if you have information
about how effective was that because

468
00:25:57,409 --> 00:25:58,850
they were like bombing faxes

469
00:25:58,850 --> 00:26:03,190
no from the US and are why can't speak
to

470
00:26:03,190 --> 00:26:07,610
the anonymous version but on ski

471
00:26:07,610 --> 00:26:11,320
but it all comes which was highly
effective and it was just that

472
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:14,830
it wasn't necessarily that they were
exclusively using it to sorta

473
00:26:14,830 --> 00:26:18,580
on you know evangelize an advocate for
specific you know positions on the

474
00:26:18,580 --> 00:26:21,080
revolution it was that they were also
saying stuff like

475
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:24,279
hey if you want to get on it this is how
on hey

476
00:26:24,279 --> 00:26:27,179
if you're if you have to guess this is
how you treat that and if your papers

477
00:26:27,179 --> 00:26:28,320
for this is how you treat that

478
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:31,649
so it meant that the piece is a paper
that would come through

479
00:26:31,650 --> 00:26:34,750
are the key to the information they
would be printed on pieces of paper and

480
00:26:34,750 --> 00:26:35,419
that you would

481
00:26:35,419 --> 00:26:38,120
may be carried around with you more
because it tells you how to do first

482
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:39,470
date and things like that

483
00:26:39,470 --> 00:26:42,980
and so maybe that helps the information
get distributed more but also they

484
00:26:42,980 --> 00:26:45,010
didn't really make a pass to themselves
they didn't

485
00:26:45,010 --> 00:26:48,350
they weren't you know black faxing
people just endlessly they sent you know

486
00:26:48,350 --> 00:26:48,950
wine

487
00:26:48,950 --> 00:26:51,980
and then hopefully that information got
out so I would actually say that was

488
00:26:51,980 --> 00:26:53,270
highly effective

489
00:26:53,270 --> 00:26:57,590
and I think our comics is completely
amazing

490
00:26:57,590 --> 00:27:01,179
a second question cool arm

491
00:27:01,179 --> 00:27:05,620
I was wondering if Lake do could be some
like curry intelligence

492
00:27:05,620 --> 00:27:08,940
no campaigns to make are

493
00:27:08,940 --> 00:27:13,049
the the day these Air Force to be

494
00:27:13,049 --> 00:27:16,360
on somehow know if I dunno

495
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:20,390
like making it making the the population

496
00:27:20,390 --> 00:27:24,309
are insecure or on

497
00:27:24,309 --> 00:27:28,700
its see how to put this on

498
00:27:28,700 --> 00:27:33,169
to make them not trust not the the help
that they're getting a bite no

499
00:27:33,169 --> 00:27:37,809
getting frustrated or even making us
were for them you know covertly

500
00:27:37,809 --> 00:27:41,490
no on making us on

501
00:27:41,490 --> 00:27:45,450
think that we actually helping but no
making us help them

502
00:27:45,450 --> 00:27:48,880
is dead I i kno and I figured getting
wanting to get

503
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:52,730
well I mean it been you know syria if
you're just gonna be a question back is

504
00:27:52,730 --> 00:27:53,120
it

505
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:56,149
from you know the facts and a certain

506
00:27:56,149 --> 00:27:59,570
making certain making people distrust
the others around them and making it

507
00:27:59,570 --> 00:28:01,350
more difficult to organize

508
00:28:01,350 --> 00:28:06,500
yes and also making us believe that
we're helping the good guys want to wear

509
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:07,720
helping the

510
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:12,880
the bad guys I think it's its it's
difficult to sort of say that

511
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:16,230
I don't think it as possible for people
that are totally outside

512
00:28:16,230 --> 00:28:19,580
this area to be helping the bad guys

513
00:28:19,580 --> 00:28:23,668
on your mileage may vary depending on
your opinion is who's going who's bad

514
00:28:23,669 --> 00:28:28,190
on things like that by I think that if
you have act if you have free access to

515
00:28:28,190 --> 00:28:31,539
information you're much more capable of
making a decision as to you

516
00:28:31,539 --> 00:28:34,860
which cited this issue are you on which
side is issuing do

517
00:28:34,860 --> 00:28:38,710
do I want to support on but I think it's
very possible

518
00:28:38,710 --> 00:28:42,200
for governments for an organization to
actually

519
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:45,830
on you generate a lot distrust start
false rumors

520
00:28:45,830 --> 00:28:49,668
right are insert people who are just
totally not who are clearly not

521
00:28:49,669 --> 00:28:53,700
with it in an attempt to turn read this
distrustful environment make it more

522
00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:54,860
difficult to organize

523
00:28:54,860 --> 00:28:58,179
and I think that's actually extremely
effective arm

524
00:28:58,179 --> 00:29:01,600
bytes i think thats that just the

525
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:04,690
the sheer number of people who are for
the revolution

526
00:29:04,690 --> 00:29:09,330
and against various governments on is
the reason why Tunisia Egypt and Libya

527
00:29:09,330 --> 00:29:12,730
and probably Syria home

528
00:29:12,730 --> 00:29:16,010
are having anti-government basically

529
00:29:16,010 --> 00:29:19,750
thank you

530
00:29:19,750 --> 00:29:23,320
children to see a loan for the
presentation thank you very much

531
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:26,870
thanks the ok to the fellow

532
00:29:26,870 --> 00:29:31,390
a before me touched upon what was gonna
I'm

533
00:29:31,390 --> 00:29:35,909
bring got the that looking from the
other on election protests on

534
00:29:35,909 --> 00:29:39,669
into the turned other media

535
00:29:39,669 --> 00:29:43,580
and Egyptian situation such one of the
challenges been

536
00:29:43,580 --> 00:29:47,980
when you set up for example proxy how to
get the word out

537
00:29:47,980 --> 00:29:51,399
but not so widely that the government
counters it

538
00:29:51,399 --> 00:29:56,549
and takes it down so a something PBS
would be a good example

539
00:29:56,549 --> 00:30:00,460
you get the number out to widely guess
what happens to that number

540
00:30:00,460 --> 00:30:03,500
and getting shut down you know that on
yes yes

541
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:08,840
a so there's it's almost a ecological
you know with a predator and prey at

542
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:11,409
that how you survive in that environment

543
00:30:11,409 --> 00:30:14,669
and a it very personally because people
manage

544
00:30:14,669 --> 00:30:18,169
through these adversities do you have
any insights on

545
00:30:18,169 --> 00:30:23,190
to yeah know this you know i think thats
a really insightful comparison is it is

546
00:30:23,190 --> 00:30:24,220
constantly this

547
00:30:24,220 --> 00:30:27,710
this predator and prey situation where
you're you know you're having to stay

548
00:30:27,710 --> 00:30:28,830
one step ahead of them

549
00:30:28,830 --> 00:30:31,850
you know you're always gonna have to
have more proxies on hand and they can

550
00:30:31,850 --> 00:30:32,320
block

551
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:35,840
and sometimes a block him on you have to
just get more really fast on

552
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:40,120
and getting the word out like fast with
BBS yes absolutely true is that you know

553
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:40,620
if you have

554
00:30:40,620 --> 00:30:44,429
if you allocate enough 10 phone numbers
to running is PBS

555
00:30:44,429 --> 00:30:49,100
and synchronizing the mall on you know
that the telephone service going to shut

556
00:30:49,100 --> 00:30:50,330
you up in like 15 minutes

557
00:30:50,330 --> 00:30:54,428
on so that's one situation there that's
that's one reason why

558
00:30:54,429 --> 00:30:58,289
mesh networks have so much promise is
because they can still locate you

559
00:30:58,289 --> 00:31:01,690
but it is technologically a little bit
more difficult and it takes a little bit

560
00:31:01,690 --> 00:31:02,309
longer

561
00:31:02,309 --> 00:31:05,820
and you can move around a lot more
because your wireless on also print more

562
00:31:05,820 --> 00:31:07,220
prone to failure and slice

563
00:31:07,220 --> 00:31:10,450
reliable than BBS so you can't you are
you really got away

564
00:31:10,450 --> 00:31:14,590
you really gonna wear but I am yeah I
mean I think that I think that it's a

565
00:31:14,590 --> 00:31:15,370
it's

566
00:31:15,370 --> 00:31:18,470
its that's always going to be the case
and it's the case with censorship

567
00:31:18,470 --> 00:31:20,250
circumventing technologies liked or

568
00:31:20,250 --> 00:31:25,309
is that they're constantly having to on
like right now tours totally blocked in

569
00:31:25,309 --> 00:31:25,870
China

570
00:31:25,870 --> 00:31:28,879
it's almost impossible for anyone to get
through in a constant me

571
00:31:28,879 --> 00:31:31,960
you know working at the same working its
working in this and

572
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:36,009
on you know there was a big guns and
then but it does take a lot of time and

573
00:31:36,009 --> 00:31:36,919
it's not guaranteed

574
00:31:36,919 --> 00:31:42,090
I am actually with our cocks and I just
wanna

575
00:31:42,090 --> 00:31:46,389
name hi yet to thank you for your kind
words and also your perspective which is

576
00:31:46,389 --> 00:31:46,980
kinda really

577
00:31:46,980 --> 00:31:50,240
next thanks get a and so I'd say she
waited

578
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:53,559
about the modem so those worked really
well in Egypt because sixty percent of

579
00:31:53,559 --> 00:31:55,070
the country was already on dial-up

580
00:31:55,070 --> 00:31:59,250
before the revolution very nice yeah in
Libya we're in the same lines and they

581
00:31:59,250 --> 00:32:01,450
got blocked by the state oK I'll in four
days

582
00:32:01,450 --> 00:32:05,830
in Syria the series will use them all
because all the phone lines are tapped

583
00:32:05,830 --> 00:32:06,090
yeah

584
00:32:06,090 --> 00:32:10,190
and so I just wonder if you could come
in and can do the diversity

585
00:32:10,190 --> 00:32:13,000
you know like that the each country is
different in kind of like the need for

586
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,159
diversity of tactics

587
00:32:14,159 --> 00:32:18,129
when you pitch that hit the nail on the
head is that every country is different

588
00:32:18,129 --> 00:32:20,080
every country all these countries are

589
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:23,789
various sizes I'm very population levels
and

590
00:32:23,789 --> 00:32:27,619
arm the binky i think is is diversity up
surveillance

591
00:32:27,619 --> 00:32:32,779
before the revolution on you know in
Egypt yeah people got tapped

592
00:32:32,779 --> 00:32:35,909
people would get you know around have
been beaten you know and and they never

593
00:32:35,909 --> 00:32:36,269
is

594
00:32:36,269 --> 00:32:39,710
you know harsh restrictions little
speech which is all be huge reason why

595
00:32:39,710 --> 00:32:44,369
there is revolution first place arm but
I think it was a lot more difficult

596
00:32:44,369 --> 00:32:46,759
because it wasn't quite as pervasive

597
00:32:46,759 --> 00:32:51,679
as Syrian I don't think that they quite
had the same technological chops as

598
00:32:51,679 --> 00:32:52,669
Syria did

599
00:32:52,669 --> 00:32:56,480
and I suspecting that serious or saw
this coming and they do seem like they

600
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:58,769
were a bit more authoritarian beforehand

601
00:32:58,769 --> 00:33:02,259
and were really wanting a tight tight
tight control

602
00:33:02,259 --> 00:33:06,340
on political speech and on I'm

603
00:33:06,340 --> 00:33:09,019
I mean really that's that's all I can
simply say but it is it all these

604
00:33:09,019 --> 00:33:09,480
countries

605
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:12,299
you know it is easy you know living in
America to see the Middle East as this

606
00:33:12,299 --> 00:33:12,990
one just

607
00:33:12,990 --> 00:33:16,159
nebulous blob somewhere arm but

608
00:33:16,159 --> 00:33:19,570
it's super divers it's just incredibly
diverse it's like

609
00:33:19,570 --> 00:33:23,590
in in lebanon as a huge percentage of
people who are Christian

610
00:33:23,590 --> 00:33:26,190
they're jews that live there they're
muslims live there they refuse to live

611
00:33:26,190 --> 00:33:28,799
there on the people of other religions
that live there

612
00:33:28,799 --> 00:33:33,710
but in america it's already have this
idea that they all look this way

613
00:33:33,710 --> 00:33:36,869
their religion is this way they all have
this one perspective and that just isn't

614
00:33:36,869 --> 00:33:40,159
doesn't mesh well they're totally
different political systems in

615
00:33:40,159 --> 00:33:44,539
even within themselves their massive
diversity is that impact every aspect of

616
00:33:44,539 --> 00:33:44,970
this

617
00:33:44,970 --> 00:33:50,080
I'm so I hate to paint this as being in
the Middle East but above all happened

618
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:51,559
so I try to point out that it's

619
00:33:51,559 --> 00:33:55,830
this country versus other countries and
how they sorted how it works how it

620
00:33:55,830 --> 00:33:56,369
doesn't work

621
00:33:56,369 --> 00:33:59,490
and to the best i can. so thanks

622
00:33:59,490 --> 00:34:03,200
anymore questions grease grease tomatoes

623
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:06,700
actually can you

624
00:34:06,700 --> 00:34:11,159
together can hear you sorry you know the
effectiveness

625
00:34:11,159 --> 00:34:15,030
of of proxy the uprising of Port trying
to you

626
00:34:15,030 --> 00:34:20,369
make in fifty traffic look nothing
affected from what I have heard which is

627
00:34:20,369 --> 00:34:21,319
admittedly like

628
00:34:21,319 --> 00:34:25,609
third hand at this point arm it actually
seems to work really well but it doesn't

629
00:34:25,609 --> 00:34:27,578
seem to work well in China on

630
00:34:27,579 --> 00:34:30,810
I think that there's something else
going on with China butts they're just

631
00:34:30,810 --> 00:34:33,489
this very difficult but I think it
depends on whether you're just trying to

632
00:34:33,490 --> 00:34:34,060
block

633
00:34:34,060 --> 00:34:37,349
encrypted traffic you know writ large

634
00:34:37,349 --> 00:34:40,790
which China does not or whether you're
specifically looking for stuff that

635
00:34:40,790 --> 00:34:41,799
looks like tore

636
00:34:41,799 --> 00:34:44,339
and I think that I think that eventually
they're going to want it you know

637
00:34:44,339 --> 00:34:45,949
catching up with china and being like

638
00:34:45,949 --> 00:34:50,040
yet take that sent home but damn I think
that right now it works really well in

639
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:51,139
Iran from right here

640
00:34:51,139 --> 00:34:58,139
and everyone seems very very happy about
it which I take as a really good sign

641
00:34:59,230 --> 00:35:03,900
your questions

642
00:35:03,900 --> 00:35:06,059
okay so much coming up to the mic so I'm
not gonna like you know

643
00:35:06,059 --> 00:35:10,180
dive dive dive

644
00:35:10,180 --> 00:35:14,649
and on any thoughts on how you get out
information about how information is

645
00:35:14,650 --> 00:35:15,470
getting out

646
00:35:15,470 --> 00:35:19,300
this is to be a chicken egg problem with
most about us it's a really

647
00:35:19,300 --> 00:35:22,350
tricky problem Iran a project's

648
00:35:22,350 --> 00:35:25,850
for two-and-a-half years almost two and
a half years

649
00:35:25,850 --> 00:35:30,150
and dealing with trans people in the
military and a lot of it weighs

650
00:35:30,150 --> 00:35:33,160
I am you know if your trendy in the
military well

651
00:35:33,160 --> 00:35:37,190
your military and thats on a prison in
the issue so

652
00:35:37,190 --> 00:35:41,210
the thing is the you know they were you
a Supercenter they can google about

653
00:35:41,210 --> 00:35:42,030
stuff because

654
00:35:42,030 --> 00:35:46,090
and then they can't Google about how the
Google without you know

655
00:35:46,090 --> 00:35:50,410
people recover their googling so it's
inserted as weird circuitous issue

656
00:35:50,410 --> 00:35:53,560
and I just don't know there's a real

657
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:57,090
you know other than direct direct word
now workshops

658
00:35:57,090 --> 00:36:01,030
I'm talking to people spreading step
into 4 ohms

659
00:36:01,030 --> 00:36:04,510
I'm thinking or receptive now expanding
people anything arm

660
00:36:04,510 --> 00:36:08,490
just making this trip information as
ubiquitous as possible to people that

661
00:36:08,490 --> 00:36:09,500
you think might need it

662
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:12,650
i think thats really the only way that
you can get that's about

663
00:36:12,650 --> 00:36:16,020
no on-air I wondered if I

664
00:36:16,020 --> 00:36:19,600
you can go that more into how things
like telecom mixer seen

665
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:23,360
by the locals that the that they're
helping like is is there that show

666
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:27,130
the exhorted yeah here come the
foreigners to help us or

667
00:36:27,130 --> 00:36:29,570
oh my god what are these foreigners
doing here why do they think they're

668
00:36:29,570 --> 00:36:31,230
they can help us why can't we do it

669
00:36:31,230 --> 00:36:35,370
everything everything is second-hand for
me but it seems like it's actually serve

670
00:36:35,370 --> 00:36:36,620
both arm

671
00:36:36,620 --> 00:36:39,660
new because some people are just sort of
content indeed a producer continuing to

672
00:36:39,660 --> 00:36:40,830
lead their lives in like

673
00:36:40,830 --> 00:36:43,890
yeah this is Thomas are bucking abortion
in which that the

674
00:36:43,890 --> 00:36:46,540
you know revolution things were that bad
before you know which is a revelation

675
00:36:46,540 --> 00:36:47,850
and you know I can

676
00:36:47,850 --> 00:36:50,920
get my customers back in you know like
to go back to normal and some people

677
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:52,610
really like that comfort

678
00:36:52,610 --> 00:36:57,240
they're really want comfort more than an
overall huge change

679
00:36:57,240 --> 00:37:01,110
that will make their lives better
possibly but

680
00:37:01,110 --> 00:37:04,810
I you honestly think it's both I think
that there are people who are just like

681
00:37:04,810 --> 00:37:05,370
you know

682
00:37:05,370 --> 00:37:09,359
who are these people and where they
injecting themselves into our business

683
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:10,610
went all of us

684
00:37:10,610 --> 00:37:13,800
and we're the ones that should be
dealing with egyptian in Egypt where the

685
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:15,150
money should be dealing with you know

686
00:37:15,150 --> 00:37:21,410
Egyptian politics am I i think that it's
also can be person by person a person

687
00:37:21,410 --> 00:37:23,270
who likes who dislikes

688
00:37:23,270 --> 00:37:27,170
so thats I can really pontificate on
that specific point

689
00:37:27,170 --> 00:37:34,170
I'm not Middle Eastern and not from
there

690
00:37:34,850 --> 00:37:39,420
