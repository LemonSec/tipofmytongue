1
00:00:01,439 --> 00:00:03,870
there is 0 there's just a small

2
00:00:03,870 --> 00:00:08,300
amount love plugging and unplugging that
needs to happen for a brief moment

3
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:12,410
are so Patrick is gonna whistle the girl
from even in a while we wait

4
00:00:12,410 --> 00:00:15,530
to your cell

5
00:00:15,530 --> 00:00:22,530
just yourself nope

6
00:00:36,579 --> 00:00:43,579
yeah up

7
00:00:58,730 --> 00:01:05,730
can you hear me OK

8
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:13,560
is okay okay

9
00:01:16,220 --> 00:01:20,800
I'm ready

10
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:24,530
ladies and gentlemen hello and welcome
to you

11
00:01:24,530 --> 00:01:28,230
mean factory or maybe we should say
hello where mean factory and thank you

12
00:01:28,230 --> 00:01:29,420
for welcoming us to help

13
00:01:29,420 --> 00:01:33,250
really excited here this is a bit of a
change for us normally when we give

14
00:01:33,250 --> 00:01:35,210
presentations they look like this

15
00:01:35,210 --> 00:01:39,400
three of us with three computers on
three screens speaking really quickly in

16
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:41,870
showing more stuff than you could
possibly absorb in an attempt to mimic

17
00:01:41,870 --> 00:01:44,420
the real-life experience we all have a
being immersed

18
00:01:44,420 --> 00:01:47,450
in the Internet at this point we've done
something like ten or twelve shows about

19
00:01:47,450 --> 00:01:49,120
the Internet and we've even

20
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:52,950
out started writing a book about
internet me which God willing will be

21
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:54,760
out by Christmas we hope you buy a copy

22
00:01:54,760 --> 00:02:01,030
Dean in we're extremely lucky to have
made something have a living from being

23
00:02:01,030 --> 00:02:02,270
experts in this kind of thing

24
00:02:02,270 --> 00:02:05,210
and it is understandable as a man you
might raise an eyebrow at the idea of

25
00:02:05,210 --> 00:02:06,380
being an expert

26
00:02:06,380 --> 00:02:11,180
in say this hipster puppy being an
expert in this little dog a really humor

27
00:02:11,180 --> 00:02:14,430
like this picture of this little dog
means yes we know that this is funny or

28
00:02:14,430 --> 00:02:15,160
maybe

29
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:18,799
funny but that also we know why it's
funny

30
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:22,880
and beyond why it's funny how it managed
to get to the point of being funny

31
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:26,859
so we explain jokes basically are but we
know all your thinking doesn't

32
00:02:26,860 --> 00:02:30,970
explaining jokes ruin them why would you
why would you ruin jokes well as common

33
00:02:30,970 --> 00:02:33,620
as the jokes are to the Internet
communities that make them

34
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:37,110
so many the Internet means an inside
joke simple areas media that exist out

35
00:02:37,110 --> 00:02:39,750
there are still largely ignored by the
general public

36
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:44,510
field imagine are what we feel like
every time we try and explain what we do

37
00:02:44,510 --> 00:02:45,250
to like

38
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:49,690
a regular even without getting into the
confusion over the word

39
00:02:49,690 --> 00:02:53,790
me him it's a poster when Ian theory of
culture from the nineteen seventies

40
00:02:53,790 --> 00:02:58,570
those pictures of cats with text on them
it's a mind virus that can infect us all

41
00:02:58,570 --> 00:03:02,480
it's the hottest new marketing technique
it goes viral to video blogs

42
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:08,690
said the French word that means same
right even without getting into the

43
00:03:08,690 --> 00:03:12,070
confusion caused by the word mean but we
still sometimes have trouble getting

44
00:03:12,070 --> 00:03:14,359
people to understand what we even mean
by

45
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:18,980
internet oh you guys are about Facebook
oh yes talk about the World Wide Web

46
00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:22,459
are you guys you guys do new media right

47
00:03:22,459 --> 00:03:27,269
you talk about routers are you guys how
the App Store I love Steve Jobs alright

48
00:03:27,269 --> 00:03:28,390
the series of tubes

49
00:03:28,390 --> 00:03:32,150
got I guess we shouldn't really blame
them I mean the fact is that the

50
00:03:32,150 --> 00:03:33,140
Internet

51
00:03:33,140 --> 00:03:36,450
that were doesn't really mean any one
thing it's kinda like when you talk

52
00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:39,650
about if you love is the comparison the
Christian Church

53
00:03:39,650 --> 00:03:42,940
what do you mean when you say the church

54
00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:46,810
one particular physical building the sum
of all people in all congregations

55
00:03:46,810 --> 00:03:47,730
around the world

56
00:03:47,730 --> 00:03:50,760
the organization bishops and deacons a
pope sort whatever that make up the

57
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:51,500
church leadership

58
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:55,859
some mystical sense have church miss
that flows from

59
00:03:55,859 --> 00:03:59,780
I don't know have been okay religious
metaphor over

60
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:02,810
so much for the time being let's work
with the definition in the world

61
00:04:02,810 --> 00:04:03,650
internet that is

62
00:04:03,650 --> 00:04:06,780
eighty the word internet that is a large
technical catch-all

63
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:09,940
meaning that the Internet is the
hardware/software protocols connections

64
00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:12,250
data packets that are currently using or
complied with

65
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:15,920
Internet Protocol if that's the case
then we can ask what this giant thing

66
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:16,739
looks like

67
00:04:16,739 --> 00:04:20,900
boom there there's are crazy if the up D
project online this

68
00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:24,530
is vena internet or really

69
00:04:24,530 --> 00:04:28,130
I'm map above the internets or really

70
00:04:28,130 --> 00:04:31,219
just one map love the Internet

71
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:33,960
you see it turns out that mapping the
internet trying to come up with a visual

72
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:37,820
representation for the whole enchilada
is also kinda mean itself

73
00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:40,990
here's another one or part of it anyway
that's more up to date

74
00:04:40,990 --> 00:04:45,410
and also a a little more yellow and here
are a couple more by a guy named Chris

75
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:47,560
Harrison an overlay onto a map of the
world

76
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:50,639
and Chris Harrison Chris Harrison is the
only one to have done that this one is

77
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:52,830
from Telia geography dot com

78
00:04:52,830 --> 00:04:56,800
but you also want that overly website
another web things into imaginary subway

79
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:59,210
systems like this one but we're all yet
quell

80
00:04:59,210 --> 00:05:02,219
are this one by all over right since
nine from information

81
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:05,870
architects I this one is from the Web
2.0 Summit mythic cute it's a bit like

82
00:05:05,870 --> 00:05:07,560
imaginary in this tiny islands

83
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:11,590
are but it's really just a with what
looked like business logos I and here's

84
00:05:11,590 --> 00:05:12,389
another one we found

85
00:05:12,389 --> 00:05:15,990
on enforce that and that's not even a
mention the whole slew of maps drawn in

86
00:05:15,990 --> 00:05:20,050
the recent internet mapping project
applauded by Kevin Kelly a few years ago

87
00:05:20,050 --> 00:05:23,850
apparently mapping internet is not only
me but a pretty popular one

88
00:05:23,850 --> 00:05:27,760
the NSA made this one ten years ago Sri
wrote this whole presentation in the

89
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:31,469
last two and a half hour that's true
plus a few hours know all these very

90
00:05:31,470 --> 00:05:34,330
intense tiles are the most well-known
maps is another one that was made by

91
00:05:34,330 --> 00:05:35,680
xkcd

92
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:38,840
which isn't just a map of the internet
more specifically a map online

93
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:40,180
communities

94
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:43,889
Facebook and Twitter and Skype aim for
change and all this stuff pictured here

95
00:05:43,889 --> 00:05:46,889
is a software running on hardware the
communique to the less of a running

96
00:05:46,889 --> 00:05:47,889
other hardware

97
00:05:47,889 --> 00:05:51,560
we use these abstractions these maps to
help us make sense what the internet is

98
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:54,520
pretty easy to lose sight of the fact
that the internet

99
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:59,750
its people so let's for the next time
being forget our technical catch on

100
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:01,430
trial more humanist one

101
00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:04,539
one assumes that the Internet is the sum
of all human actions taken on

102
00:06:04,539 --> 00:06:08,940
and with it sure there are lot a box and
servers and demons out their digital

103
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:12,210
entities that have intentionally
personify names which take actions and

104
00:06:12,210 --> 00:06:13,770
make connections and produce media

105
00:06:13,770 --> 00:06:17,120
you who aren't human at all but the
software and the hardware that's all

106
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:19,460
something that people are doing

107
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:22,758
people build these things to facilitate
min hands all the different things that

108
00:06:22,759 --> 00:06:23,659
we want

109
00:06:23,659 --> 00:06:26,509
to do and where these behaviors and
desires happen to be limited by

110
00:06:26,509 --> 00:06:28,159
technology or by the government

111
00:06:28,159 --> 00:06:31,259
are within those people need to step in
and do it themselves

112
00:06:31,259 --> 00:06:34,470
most notably might be the Chinese
practice a running human flesh search

113
00:06:34,470 --> 00:06:35,319
engines

114
00:06:35,319 --> 00:06:38,389
China has long been pretty the infamous
for its practices have internet

115
00:06:38,389 --> 00:06:39,090
censorship

116
00:06:39,090 --> 00:06:42,379
the most infamous example which has been
the relationship to search engine i'm ok

117
00:06:42,379 --> 00:06:44,870
this year probably take web searches
relatively for granted

118
00:06:44,870 --> 00:06:48,509
that the only way to findings online but
algorithmic crawler enabled search still

119
00:06:48,509 --> 00:06:50,539
accounts for a ton of what track

120
00:06:50,539 --> 00:06:53,930
in the absence of reliable algorithmic
search is groups are Chinese Internet

121
00:06:53,930 --> 00:06:57,020
users began to gather together to
perform searches to a more

122
00:06:57,020 --> 00:07:00,729
collaborative and brute force measure
essentially creating defacto

123
00:07:00,729 --> 00:07:04,030
research group sometimes hundreds of
thousands of people

124
00:07:04,030 --> 00:07:07,169
hundreds sometimes thousands people
willing to help

125
00:07:07,169 --> 00:07:10,229
look for something a lot of times the
thing that was looked for

126
00:07:10,229 --> 00:07:13,990
end up being the identity of another
real person in China this as a sort of

127
00:07:13,990 --> 00:07:16,199
second meaning to the human flesh

128
00:07:16,199 --> 00:07:19,590
in human flesh search engine and will
certainly not always successful it's

129
00:07:19,590 --> 00:07:21,979
been often use practice in China over
the last 10 years

130
00:07:21,979 --> 00:07:24,770
in factory description of human flesh
search engines they're not very

131
00:07:24,770 --> 00:07:27,900
different from Survivor spoiler
communities the Henry Jenkins right

132
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:29,009
about convergence

133
00:07:29,009 --> 00:07:32,250
loose group of individuals who would
volunteer their time to common into a

134
00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:35,930
common information based cars posting
and collaborating on digital spaces like

135
00:07:35,930 --> 00:07:39,360
forums or message board a practice that
like the human flesh search engines

136
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:41,229
often require a lot of fun work

137
00:07:41,229 --> 00:07:45,020
and you know a large group of through
anonymous individuals bring offline

138
00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:47,628
experience a research together
contribute to an online project that

139
00:07:47,629 --> 00:07:50,020
sounds an awful lot like Wikipedia

140
00:07:50,020 --> 00:07:54,150
or if you're willing at a little and we
mean a very little money to the equation

141
00:07:54,150 --> 00:07:57,509
this is the business model or
organizational model of Mechanical Turk

142
00:07:57,509 --> 00:08:00,680
I'm any computer scientist Luzon armpit
the best in his description a project

143
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:00,979
like

144
00:08:00,979 --> 00:08:04,878
capture systems that combine humans and
computers to solve large-scale problems

145
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:06,419
that neither can solve alone.

146
00:08:06,419 --> 00:08:09,830
I call this human computation by others
sometimes call it crowdsourcing

147
00:08:09,830 --> 00:08:13,310
a fantastic recent example a
computer-aided human creativity is the

148
00:08:13,310 --> 00:08:14,389
often irreverent

149
00:08:14,389 --> 00:08:17,620
exquisite corpse style draw ception

150
00:08:17,620 --> 00:08:20,129
which these random group of people
trying their best to interpret the

151
00:08:20,129 --> 00:08:21,729
drawings and text up there

152
00:08:21,729 --> 00:08:24,949
fellow players she was gonna

153
00:08:24,949 --> 00:08:28,009
there's someone writes Batman doing
laundry

154
00:08:28,009 --> 00:08:31,610
and then someone draws Batman doing
laundry and someone sees that and I

155
00:08:31,610 --> 00:08:32,110
think

156
00:08:32,110 --> 00:08:35,570
that is changing his pants so then
someone drive that means eating

157
00:08:35,570 --> 00:08:38,930
paint the undisguised at that may decide
to become

158
00:08:38,930 --> 00:08:45,930
more fabulous bears fabulous Batman

159
00:08:50,189 --> 00:08:52,620
drop by all aidid once

160
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:59,420
I really like this one

161
00:08:59,420 --> 00:09:03,420
but

162
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:09,360
been pays off stick with it

163
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:16,360
okay see the bomb did you see the bottom

164
00:09:19,590 --> 00:09:22,450
it's done poorly on him

165
00:09:22,450 --> 00:09:25,840
okay and the result why not as
largescale

166
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:28,890
as a survivor spoilers Wikipedia or
Mechanical Turk

167
00:09:28,890 --> 00:09:32,740
there are at least very funny okay but
before we move on we think its part to

168
00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:35,180
point out one of the big common thread
in all these products

169
00:09:35,180 --> 00:09:39,260
collaboration we think the collaboration
is an obvious central component to what

170
00:09:39,260 --> 00:09:40,689
makes so much on the Internet

171
00:09:40,690 --> 00:09:43,810
so awesome and to be part of what making
it means what they are

172
00:09:43,810 --> 00:09:46,920
and even though lightning speed
persistent international digital

173
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:49,760
collaboration may feel completely new
and different sometimes

174
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:52,310
it's important to remember the group
people have been getting together to do

175
00:09:52,310 --> 00:09:54,580
more than some other parts for as long
as they've existed

176
00:09:54,580 --> 00:09:58,450
we may be having a metaphor too hard but
the theorist Emile Durkheim who kind of

177
00:09:58,450 --> 00:09:59,880
invented sociology

178
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:03,150
he believed it was the power of social
collaboration

179
00:10:03,150 --> 00:10:06,860
and people attempt to explain that power
before they can really understand it

180
00:10:06,860 --> 00:10:09,870
which is the actual origin or religion
like

181
00:10:09,870 --> 00:10:13,370
sure in the last 10 years we've become
really comfortable with the concept that

182
00:10:13,370 --> 00:10:15,420
group of people collaborating can
produce

183
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:18,459
some incredible results but if you were
an early human with little to no

184
00:10:18,460 --> 00:10:21,040
language in a Facebook account you may
be so mystified

185
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:24,480
mystified by the effectiveness a group
that you attributed that power to Monday

186
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:25,250
Dr another

187
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:28,490
but let's go back to modern-day you got
red it's random axe a pizza a place

188
00:10:28,490 --> 00:10:30,050
where those who are down on their luck

189
00:10:30,050 --> 00:10:33,160
can request that someone's bring for
their pizza dinner and that those who

190
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:34,900
are able and willing to assist

191
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:39,020
do exactly that random acts a pizza
stands as an example of how a new kind

192
00:10:39,020 --> 00:10:41,470
of civil collaboration where and serve
unleashing their

193
00:10:41,470 --> 00:10:45,460
did people turn into kind caring giving
citizens we also see the effects have

194
00:10:45,460 --> 00:10:48,200
distributed collaborative work in the
online gene sequencing game

195
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:52,510
filo file is a competitive online game
which assists research in determining

196
00:10:52,510 --> 00:10:54,550
genetic patterns which can cause
diseases

197
00:10:54,550 --> 00:10:57,660
and the thing is it actually works it's
funny when you think about it no matter

198
00:10:57,660 --> 00:11:00,760
how sophisticated is online
collaborative work is collaborating to

199
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:04,250
get dinner and stay healthy is probably
exactly what early humans were working

200
00:11:04,250 --> 00:11:04,890
on two

201
00:11:04,890 --> 00:11:08,610
but the human experience is an all about
biological necessities as people we also

202
00:11:08,610 --> 00:11:12,080
have social or societal need I the
social needs are most focused on how we

203
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:13,200
treat one another

204
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:16,490
the behaviors that we adopt negotiate
life around other people

205
00:11:16,490 --> 00:11:19,840
well as behaviors is resistance advocacy

206
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:23,360
activist groups have been using means an
American tend to spread their message

207
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:25,190
and a simple to rally behind for

208
00:11:25,190 --> 00:11:29,300
a very long time I mean the Crusades a
weird kind activist movement to spread

209
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:31,130
Christianity is II religions well

210
00:11:31,130 --> 00:11:33,600
they rally behind the crop which you
know we don't often think it was a mean

211
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:35,860
but while there have been a lot of
mutations on that one

212
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:39,400
out more recently we've had these
symbols for peace

213
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:42,260
means create a spread a message and
quickly and easily express solidarity

214
00:11:42,260 --> 00:11:46,020
with that message so now today we have
the Internet a complicated electronic

215
00:11:46,020 --> 00:11:47,480
machine for spreading

216
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:50,620
means it spreads means which is
something that people have done for ever

217
00:11:50,620 --> 00:11:51,890
just spreads them better

218
00:11:51,890 --> 00:11:55,610
archives am so I'm not having a
conversation or sing the song to the

219
00:11:55,610 --> 00:11:59,120
person you don't have to be there every
time the conversations had or the song

220
00:11:59,120 --> 00:11:59,839
in song

221
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:03,670
it broadcasts to everyone with access
immediately in simultaneously so that

222
00:12:03,670 --> 00:12:04,979
the ordinary limit to them

223
00:12:04,980 --> 00:12:08,440
number of people or physical location
other people you're trying to share your

224
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:09,710
message with has just gone

225
00:12:09,710 --> 00:12:13,040
and the third thing is access with
television messages could be pre-taped

226
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:16,079
in with the invention VCR's in Dr's the
message could be played back

227
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:20,310
whenever you like and with first
antennas then cable and satellite the

228
00:12:20,310 --> 00:12:23,290
physical location of your audience
mattered less and less

229
00:12:23,290 --> 00:12:26,610
but only the people with access to very
expensive cameras broadcasting equipment

230
00:12:26,610 --> 00:12:30,020
and broadcasting licenses would create
the messages that were to be distributed

231
00:12:30,020 --> 00:12:33,610
with the Internet it's almost like
everyone with a television has their own

232
00:12:33,610 --> 00:12:34,410
channel

233
00:12:34,410 --> 00:12:37,839
the big breakthrough up the Internet is
access well and much much better

234
00:12:37,839 --> 00:12:39,330
archival or triple system but

235
00:12:39,330 --> 00:12:42,660
the internet isn't just for the small
guys it's not just for the stuff UN your

236
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:45,839
peers are creating cherry I mean we all
have access to the people who've more

237
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:49,390
less monopolize the cultural means a
production and distribution up until now

238
00:12:49,390 --> 00:12:52,920
they also have access regardless of how
much the three of us care about

239
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:56,270
communication they comin dot com stands
for commercial

240
00:12:56,270 --> 00:12:59,420
so there was a point at which we can say
the internet was largely a platform

241
00:12:59,420 --> 00:13:02,780
in whatever form it was for
communication as distinct from

242
00:13:02,780 --> 00:13:07,439
commerce that point in the nineties came
to an end and in gold rush like fervor

243
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:11,140
there was not an invasion but rather
something quite resembling one let's go

244
00:13:11,140 --> 00:13:12,310
ahead call invasion

245
00:13:12,310 --> 00:13:15,120
are some corporations arrives and
realize they're all these people looking

246
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:17,330
all this content alongside the content
was not

247
00:13:17,330 --> 00:13:21,370
one advertisement and furthermore all
those people looking all that content

248
00:13:21,370 --> 00:13:22,040
they figured out

249
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:25,680
in addition to looking the internet
could probably help them do

250
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:30,290
somethings they could use the Internet
as a kind of coffee shop moth restore

251
00:13:30,290 --> 00:13:31,730
back alley swap meet

252
00:13:31,730 --> 00:13:34,420
which routes convenience didn't
encourage the growth and departed the

253
00:13:34,420 --> 00:13:37,339
web dedicated to the creation and
dissemination of culture

254
00:13:37,339 --> 00:13:41,050
I was called that part free but to the
park concerned with profits analytical

255
00:13:41,050 --> 00:13:42,940
at Park commercial

256
00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:46,240
which is totally fine we were the first
people in the room to say that we find

257
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:48,740
the existence of money interests on the
Internet

258
00:13:48,740 --> 00:13:52,650
fine and correct and convenient and fair
and all that other good stuff

259
00:13:52,650 --> 00:13:56,709
equal access is the name of the game as
the internet grows both in size and

260
00:13:56,709 --> 00:14:00,339
purpose from mostly discussion with yes
some advertising in some commerce to

261
00:14:00,339 --> 00:14:03,240
this crazy huge multi-purpose thing
where if you don't wanna be a member for

262
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:04,050
community

263
00:14:04,050 --> 00:14:07,430
you don't have to and if you don't wanna
buy shoes are books have been on comic

264
00:14:07,430 --> 00:14:08,370
books you're up to

265
00:14:08,370 --> 00:14:12,060
were told about that mostly sorta like
in theory

266
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:15,600
what we're fine with is when everyone
can coexist and that there's peace

267
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:18,839
are in the same way that we saw a gold
lush Gold Rush like

268
00:14:18,839 --> 00:14:22,290
fervor sending everyone to technical
adoption on the internet we now see that

269
00:14:22,290 --> 00:14:25,310
same Gold Rush like fervor leading large
organizations towards

270
00:14:25,310 --> 00:14:28,930
cultural adoption which is to say

271
00:14:28,930 --> 00:14:33,260
the internet milkshake it has brought
all the marketing departments to the

272
00:14:33,260 --> 00:14:35,430
yard

273
00:14:35,430 --> 00:14:38,800
compare it but who

274
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:41,839
in this makes coexistence a little
harder to swallow

275
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:45,250
if not for technical reasons than for
what might not exactly be but sorta

276
00:14:45,250 --> 00:14:45,910
approach

277
00:14:45,910 --> 00:14:49,740
territorial recently no territorial like
when you the first kid like abandoned in

278
00:14:49,740 --> 00:14:52,500
like two years later all the cool kids
like that Daniel a really

279
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:57,420
make imagine the wind irises and damp
upper lips present when it first it was

280
00:14:57,420 --> 00:14:59,930
realized that if people were excited the
passing around videos of cats

281
00:14:59,930 --> 00:15:04,020
jumping-off have tables

282
00:15:04,020 --> 00:15:08,800
I'll orchids falling intervenes

283
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:13,810
made for almost literally zero dollars
they would certainly excited the passer

284
00:15:13,810 --> 00:15:16,040
une multi-million-dollar promotional
material

285
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:21,160
for their favorite cover your ears if
you're sensitive to foul language

286
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:26,079
brains mostly it hasn't worked because
the logical the free culture and the

287
00:15:26,079 --> 00:15:29,000
logical the commercial culture are
almost exclusively opposed

288
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:32,760
like what is common on one is rejecting
the other what excites one is terrifying

289
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:35,450
to the other and what a successful in
one will take on the other

290
00:15:35,450 --> 00:15:40,070
except for talk point now it would seem
which is about a surprising to us as

291
00:15:40,070 --> 00:15:44,190
proof the world is round was to the
Portuguese in 1521

292
00:15:44,190 --> 00:15:51,190
also fuck this cotton

293
00:15:52,190 --> 00:15:55,730
in a culture exhibits a certain
characteristic irreverence

294
00:15:55,730 --> 00:15:59,380
and supports what amounts to a nearly
dissolve sense of continuity ham

295
00:15:59,380 --> 00:16:04,709
sandwich tiny kitten explosions be drawn
animated gif remain eating popcorn

296
00:16:04,709 --> 00:16:08,209
which would be easy in a way to parent
if not for the fact that in a culture

297
00:16:08,209 --> 00:16:12,500
also places a premium on authenticity
which by and large if you were a

298
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:17,980
here comes again Iran and you probably
can't or don't or won't have

299
00:16:17,980 --> 00:16:23,040
not sure what we mean let's talk about
smart water

300
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:29,610
there's a audio for this

301
00:16:29,610 --> 00:16:32,160
do

302
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:37,589
am sorry I we're professionals

303
00:16:37,590 --> 00:16:44,590
them we have done this before

304
00:16:55,980 --> 00:16:56,260
hi

305
00:16:56,260 --> 00:16:59,750

tasting water that's out there

312
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:26,569
I have to make a video apparently that
I'm turns into a virus

313
00:17:26,569 --> 00:17:29,960
viral so we need to video

this is why have these three lovely
internet boys here to help me

317
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:40,180
so apparently well animals are huge
online

318
00:17:40,180 --> 00:17:44,240
three handles only

319
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:49,800
K nerves my lord

320
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:53,540
I love might like hydro

321
00:17:53,540 --> 00:17:59,170
here it's a joke about a friend okay
bust

322
00:17:59,170 --> 00:18:03,100
and then the talk about Old Spice

323
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:06,670
now back to me

324
00:18:06,670 --> 00:18:11,690
now back at your man now back to me
sadly he is a but we stop using ladies

325
00:18:11,690 --> 00:18:12,610
and body wash

326
00:18:12,610 --> 00:18:15,910
switch to Old Spice he could smell like
it's me looked out back

327
00:18:15,910 --> 00:18:19,490
where r you're on a boat with the man
your man could smell

328
00:18:19,490 --> 00:18:22,960
what's your head back I have its invoice
to

329
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:27,230
two tickets to that thing you know look
again the tickets are now diamonds

330
00:18:27,230 --> 00:18:30,360
Hannah

331
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:33,940
so I these are two very different ways
of thinking about the Internet and the

332
00:18:33,940 --> 00:18:36,660
first way is the way where the Internet
can do something for you

333
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:40,680
and you very much what the United that
thing for you until you try so hard to

334
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:42,890
make the thing that the internet likes

335
00:18:42,890 --> 00:18:45,720
I mean kudos in a certain sense the
Smart Water for wearing their

336
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:47,060
desperation on their sleeve

337
00:18:47,060 --> 00:18:49,919
other brewing

338
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:53,120
owns ones we can not to mention if for
no other reason than why give away any

339
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:55,430
more free advertising than we already
have

340
00:18:55,430 --> 00:18:58,330
allspice more water if you want your
emails dollar bills to the main factory

341
00:18:58,330 --> 00:18:59,360
headquarters in brooklyn

342
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:03,490
other brands have more than one set of
me nearly impossible task attending some

343
00:19:03,490 --> 00:19:05,300
kinda Julie with respect to

344
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:08,760
seizing the internet moment which is to
say

345
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:12,260
making some marketing material which
co-ops what's

346
00:19:12,260 --> 00:19:15,920
hip on the Internet books

347
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:20,110
which is distinct as we tend to think
that from the way Old Spice went about

348
00:19:20,110 --> 00:19:21,850
their man your man could smell like
campaign

349
00:19:21,850 --> 00:19:25,310
seeing not to exploit existing Internet
culture these guys said about making

350
00:19:25,310 --> 00:19:27,080
something which seems internet

351
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:31,620
while not really been crib from the
internet other similar spirit animals

352
00:19:31,620 --> 00:19:34,910
can be found in say the two men Eric
show Arrested Development girl talk to

353
00:19:34,910 --> 00:19:35,690
Scott Pilgrim

354
00:19:35,690 --> 00:19:39,480
piece is a medium which sure have a
stated our core goal last narrative just

355
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:43,010
a position feels sales or all of the
above are willing to sacrifice the

356
00:19:43,010 --> 00:19:45,980
purity that goal to reward challenge
entertain their fans

357
00:19:45,980 --> 00:19:50,110
or I guess in the case allspice right
like their consumers which is maybe the

358
00:19:50,110 --> 00:19:52,210
finer point we're trying to put on this
whole thing

359
00:19:52,210 --> 00:19:57,470
the Internet is allowing Brewer a tends
to turn their customers in the fans

360
00:19:57,470 --> 00:20:01,030
these two relationships are very
different and were much in a media

361
00:20:01,030 --> 00:20:03,879
already has a huge fan base how nice
would it be

362
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:07,480
if the corpse could just be all sOooo
and grab and done

363
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:10,670
as so if the brain to make their
customers as loyal as fans are

364
00:20:10,670 --> 00:20:14,340
that might be just the the best way for
them to win the battle for attention

365
00:20:14,340 --> 00:20:18,100
the case in point maybe you know nonstop
he is a dancer

366
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:21,190
also somalia here

367
00:20:21,190 --> 00:20:28,190
better on

368
00:20:28,690 --> 00:20:35,690
you

369
00:21:05,430 --> 00:21:09,600
in

370
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:12,330
so as far as French Middle Eastern
poppin lockers who are really into dub

371
00:21:12,330 --> 00:21:13,580
step go this guy

372
00:21:13,580 --> 00:21:17,889
is basically royalty and this creature
appears actually a couple months old

373
00:21:17,890 --> 00:21:21,410
arm and in the intervening time this
video has received another 12

374
00:21:21,410 --> 00:21:25,050
ready million views so

375
00:21:25,050 --> 00:21:28,810
maybe this is putting up putting things
lightly but the people they seem to like

376
00:21:28,810 --> 00:21:29,929
mister nonstop

377
00:21:29,930 --> 00:21:34,000
quite a bit actually he has what you
might call a following a fan base which

378
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,950
is an attractive thing to the people who
instead of following

379
00:21:36,950 --> 00:21:41,270
the following the fan base have instead
another thing dollars

380
00:21:41,270 --> 00:21:43,990
the union between the person with the
following in the person with the

381
00:21:43,990 --> 00:21:46,700
dollar's especially in an internet
situation can go

382
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:49,990
really either way just happened though
that in the way that we're talking about

383
00:21:49,990 --> 00:21:50,670
to show you

384
00:21:50,670 --> 00:21:56,700
articles actually rather well the

385
00:21:56,700 --> 00:21:59,330
the

386
00:21:59,330 --> 00:22:06,330
the

387
00:22:16,739 --> 00:22:18,659
so nonstop did a spot for

388
00:22:18,659 --> 00:22:22,749
who Joe and it's pretty good I mean it's
actually it's free it's pretty not bad

389
00:22:22,749 --> 00:22:23,519
it's pretty

390
00:22:23,519 --> 00:22:27,159
I'm not I mean I get so when we started
this whole conversation was about

391
00:22:27,159 --> 00:22:30,989
coexistence it was about the free in the
commercial living together in authentic

392
00:22:30,989 --> 00:22:31,789
non-cooperative

393
00:22:31,789 --> 00:22:34,919
equally beneficial technologically
determined coexistence and

394
00:22:34,919 --> 00:22:39,129
here we are we made it when we talk
about coexistence it seems weird to make

395
00:22:39,129 --> 00:22:41,599
a piece for advertising our example
parks along

396
00:22:41,599 --> 00:22:45,829
but in a way it really is non-stop gets
a dances fans get to see him dance

397
00:22:45,829 --> 00:22:49,440
the music is totally in his wheelhouse
it even new music and release before the

398
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:52,190
spots are making the rounds and it's
pretty good music to

399
00:22:52,190 --> 00:22:57,169
they're just happens to be a car in the
background i'm for the first

400
00:22:57,169 --> 00:23:00,529
units are perfume into the video it's
even a little unclear is an

401
00:23:00,529 --> 00:23:01,739
advertisement all

402
00:23:01,739 --> 00:23:05,049
I'm which is pretty nice %uh because is
penny arcade has recently reminded

403
00:23:05,049 --> 00:23:06,889
everyone with their Kickstarter campaign

404
00:23:06,889 --> 00:23:11,499
people hate advertising which means
people can feel less guilty about liking

405
00:23:11,499 --> 00:23:11,859
it

406
00:23:11,859 --> 00:23:15,309
and a little less guilty about sharing
it and we feel a little less guilty

407
00:23:15,309 --> 00:23:16,658
about having shown it to you %uh

408
00:23:16,659 --> 00:23:20,739
so also full disclosure not over zones
up usual or really knows the correct

409
00:23:20,739 --> 00:23:22,019
pronunciation

410
00:23:22,019 --> 00:23:25,019
love wish Peugeot per

411
00:23:25,019 --> 00:23:28,489
ways you merge someone someone is out
about the Corinthian

412
00:23:28,489 --> 00:23:33,119
who was you lose your my girlfriend is
English and she tried to teach me how to

413
00:23:33,119 --> 00:23:33,819
stand it

414
00:23:33,819 --> 00:23:37,839
after five minutes like this is not a
happy Miyuki abuse puget

415
00:23:37,839 --> 00:23:41,619
puget who June of Puget it's just like
the same just like yeah

416
00:23:41,619 --> 00:23:45,479
just like that place that we had sounds
like in so with a pre-show

417
00:23:45,479 --> 00:23:48,679
I mean did here was to exhibit what we
might call

418
00:23:48,679 --> 00:23:52,719
media awareness they paid attention what
is good and not like mainstream zoomed

419
00:23:52,719 --> 00:23:55,940
out aerial view general concepts and
practices good but rather like they

420
00:23:55,940 --> 00:23:58,589
found a guy who's doing a good thing in
the probably

421
00:23:58,589 --> 00:24:01,389
handed him a big bag of money and they
told him to do the good thing he does

422
00:24:01,389 --> 00:24:04,119
well in for a one other products and a
everyone that's a wrap

423
00:24:04,119 --> 00:24:08,940
wants Thai food here you know the stock
good it's really complicated I mean says

424
00:24:08,940 --> 00:24:09,429
who

425
00:24:09,429 --> 00:24:13,069
we will clearly $56 million views says
sell but remember how we were talking

426
00:24:13,069 --> 00:24:14,479
about the old guard

427
00:24:14,479 --> 00:24:17,759
not being so good with new media and the
new media not really being into the way

428
00:24:17,759 --> 00:24:19,209
the old guard does business

429
00:24:19,209 --> 00:24:22,399
how free in commercial they're not
exactly bosom buddies

430
00:24:22,399 --> 00:24:26,469
anyway the point is they took a mask and
they did a good job in that night and we

431
00:24:26,469 --> 00:24:29,989
everyone that we can actually learn some
lessons from this me neither free nor

432
00:24:29,989 --> 00:24:31,559
commercial are going anywhere

433
00:24:31,559 --> 00:24:34,190
and regardless if however the
relationship develops if it did not at

434
00:24:34,190 --> 00:24:34,589
all

435
00:24:34,589 --> 00:24:37,969
they will both continue to grow and
growth in this case means many things

436
00:24:37,969 --> 00:24:41,009
growth means population yes and in
technological capability

437
00:24:41,009 --> 00:24:44,159
and maybe most importantly cultural
influence

438
00:24:44,159 --> 00:24:48,099
and as both of them grow now this is a
little bit this is the confusing part

439
00:24:48,099 --> 00:24:51,450
they will converge nonstop spew shows
spot

440
00:24:51,450 --> 00:24:54,809
that's a bit of a convergence but a
small one and a familiar one someone

441
00:24:54,809 --> 00:24:56,769
with the towers paid to perform a talent

442
00:24:56,769 --> 00:25:00,459
the wild card here is that his talent
was found on the internet a larger more

443
00:25:00,459 --> 00:25:03,459
complex free slash commercial
convergence is exemplified

444
00:25:03,459 --> 00:25:06,489
maybe even perfected by the cheeseburger

445
00:25:06,489 --> 00:25:10,399
network now perfected in the free labor
watermarking extremely probable media

446
00:25:10,399 --> 00:25:11,859
aggregator sense remain

447
00:25:11,859 --> 00:25:16,299
okay I never really cheeseburger has its
flaws but as a major player in what we

448
00:25:16,299 --> 00:25:19,658
were right here casually referred to as
the mainstream occasional the Internet

449
00:25:19,659 --> 00:25:22,839
there are actually a fair number of
things that they really really get right

450
00:25:22,839 --> 00:25:25,658
things like how internet culture is
really entertaining and really

451
00:25:25,659 --> 00:25:27,999
empowering but the place is it really
happens

452
00:25:27,999 --> 00:25:32,649
ground zero so to speak aren't really
for everyone %ah

453
00:25:32,649 --> 00:25:35,819
they are crowded more than a little
confusing and sometimes they have really

454
00:25:35,819 --> 00:25:38,349
high barriers to entry sort of like the
real

455
00:25:38,349 --> 00:25:41,979
Ground Zero actually but that doesn't
mean that my mom or your sister or this

456
00:25:41,979 --> 00:25:45,059
guy's dad or this lady's cousin Jim
shouldn't be able to experience the

457
00:25:45,059 --> 00:25:46,769
wonder and all that is

458
00:25:46,769 --> 00:25:53,769
Hannah Montana reckon repellent how

459
00:25:54,019 --> 00:25:57,559
how out home

460
00:25:57,559 --> 00:26:01,299
well home

461
00:26:01,299 --> 00:26:04,408
help Mom home well

462
00:26:04,409 --> 00:26:11,409
sages gonna spray down and sell

463
00:26:12,930 --> 00:26:15,890
and what and what would appear to be his
pet raccoon the

464
00:26:15,890 --> 00:26:19,690
is no longer interested invite him but
the

465
00:26:19,690 --> 00:26:26,690
edges that gets me every time

466
00:26:28,470 --> 00:26:32,440
him but what situation

467
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:37,059
does this happen and I have so many
questions I have so many questions

468
00:26:37,059 --> 00:26:40,940
like it's clearly not actually Hannah
Montana reckon repellent what is it

469
00:26:40,940 --> 00:26:45,259
what his him up at all any with in which
is to say that the Cheezburger network

470
00:26:45,259 --> 00:26:48,419
and their sites like no you're mean I
Can Has Cheezburger mean base

471
00:26:48,419 --> 00:26:52,149
they bring these things to the front of
the line or the top at the threat to the

472
00:26:52,149 --> 00:26:53,990
to the mountain or whatever metaphor you
like best

473
00:26:53,990 --> 00:26:57,399
in it make sure that they are seen by
people who might not otherwise

474
00:26:57,399 --> 00:27:01,919
and yes there our ads and sometimes they
are the best attribution

475
00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:04,970
and sometimes their attitude about the
whole aggregation things a little

476
00:27:04,970 --> 00:27:09,369
unsophisticated but hey you know what it
works and the convergence here between

477
00:27:09,369 --> 00:27:10,539
free and commercial

478
00:27:10,539 --> 00:27:14,590
works it doesn't necessarily work
because I the editorial train teams

479
00:27:14,590 --> 00:27:17,980
treat the content or the people who made
the content though clearly try their

480
00:27:17,980 --> 00:27:19,860
damndest to be good people there
certainly

481
00:27:19,860 --> 00:27:23,299
not even but rather because the
editorial teams there aggregating

482
00:27:23,299 --> 00:27:24,799
editing and whatever ring

483
00:27:24,799 --> 00:27:28,360
all those pictures attached they get
what internet culture is

484
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:32,110
it is for all intents and purposes Gary
here for the broadest broad sweeping the

485
00:27:32,110 --> 00:27:33,379
broad sweeping generalization

486
00:27:33,379 --> 00:27:37,519
the culture of people all are not in
like the soviet way by

487
00:27:37,519 --> 00:27:41,549
in the internet way in a culture is our
folk art our folk culture

488
00:27:41,549 --> 00:27:44,779
we don't think a book culture synonymous
with our own because he used to be the

489
00:27:44,779 --> 00:27:47,440
focal turn technology cultured never
interacted

490
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:52,080
there was no then diagram but that is no
longer true the ability to make

491
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:55,799
complex rich media and to distribute it
and to find and consume it is now all

492
00:27:55,799 --> 00:27:56,470
available

493
00:27:56,470 --> 00:27:59,909
not just to the mayor rights holders I
it's able to every person to all the

494
00:27:59,909 --> 00:28:00,740
folks

495
00:28:00,740 --> 00:28:06,340
are we are now at the point where this
out

496
00:28:06,340 --> 00:28:10,470
and S no no notes the analyst Steve

497
00:28:10,470 --> 00:28:14,240
steve is busy showing lesley Anne I
don't know we can't go forward until it

498
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:18,820
comes together again I'm sorry there's
no they did you guys get this point

499
00:28:18,820 --> 00:28:21,059
although we didn't say this light again
we r

500
00:28:21,059 --> 00:28:24,629
to a rough and this in oh yeah

501
00:28:24,629 --> 00:28:28,110
by I thought it went to foreign

502
00:28:28,110 --> 00:28:34,019
now too far back I'm so they combine
this is the one

503
00:28:34,019 --> 00:28:38,659
a belt diagram is OK

504
00:28:38,659 --> 00:28:41,679
wat does everything this one

505
00:28:41,679 --> 00:28:46,179
and their okay and this

506
00:28:46,179 --> 00:28:49,960
are our folk art like this is our whole
culture now

507
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:53,539
folklorist Vladimir Propp said that
folklore that it circulates

508
00:28:53,539 --> 00:28:56,908
changing all the time in this
circulation and change ability are among

509
00:28:56,909 --> 00:29:02,059
its specific characteristics so in this
way this makes it so folklore and folk

510
00:29:02,059 --> 00:29:03,070
art have no

511
00:29:03,070 --> 00:29:07,678
real offers this idea maps on internet
culture into very real way is first and

512
00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:11,299
foremost maybe we don't know who this
guy is and maybe we don't know who took

513
00:29:11,299 --> 00:29:14,700
the photo and in a way because it is
this work belongs to everyone

514
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:18,240
but then what we do with the
International Talk Show and look what we

515
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:20,330
learn his name even the name of the
photographer

516
00:29:20,330 --> 00:29:25,269
in the face of authorship does the hours
mister this piece a media breakdown

517
00:29:25,269 --> 00:29:29,190
I mean the old model would say yes
Constantin films owns downfall

518
00:29:29,190 --> 00:29:32,820
and when you try to make it your own by
subtitling in a funny way

519
00:29:32,820 --> 00:29:36,450
you make it less there's then they are
comfortable with and then you have to

520
00:29:36,450 --> 00:29:37,309
deal

521
00:29:37,309 --> 00:29:41,769
with the repre- cautions lawsuits but
the new model the new folk culture says

522
00:29:41,769 --> 00:29:42,340
no

523
00:29:42,340 --> 00:29:45,609
in the face of authorship the peace
media remains just as much

524
00:29:45,609 --> 00:29:48,980
hours as it is the author's and we all
enter into that understanding

525
00:29:48,980 --> 00:29:53,149
internet cultural contract it is the
only ship that you feel over downfall

526
00:29:53,149 --> 00:29:55,559
when subtitling it or the ownership that
you feel

527
00:29:55,559 --> 00:29:59,220
over my little pony: while captioning at
practically articulated

528
00:29:59,220 --> 00:30:02,809
and cheese burger get personal time a
cheeseburger is willing and consistently

529
00:30:02,809 --> 00:30:05,210
able most likely because %uh the cash
they've amassed as a cop

530
00:30:05,210 --> 00:30:08,700
commercial in her eyes commercial
enterprise aggregating free content

531
00:30:08,700 --> 00:30:12,570
to go to bat for this cultural contract
and this new wave treating and using in

532
00:30:12,570 --> 00:30:14,939
thinking about and consuming culture in
a real way

533
00:30:14,940 --> 00:30:18,210
you know like when this happens and
they're not alone of course to learn

534
00:30:18,210 --> 00:30:21,259
editor right there with them though they
are maybe vaguely less commercial and

535
00:30:21,259 --> 00:30:24,419
Facebook is up there too in the
decidedly commercial is less concerted

536
00:30:24,419 --> 00:30:28,119
a in awake on is in a less concerted way
concerned with

537
00:30:28,119 --> 00:30:31,999
internet culture so much they're
concerned with internet infrastructure

538
00:30:31,999 --> 00:30:35,249
the point is that there are different
kinds of commercial entities summit get

539
00:30:35,249 --> 00:30:36,519
it and some that do not

540
00:30:36,519 --> 00:30:41,039
and a third group to get that in a way
we don't like unfortunately the Internet

541
00:30:41,039 --> 00:30:41,999
is under constant

542
00:30:41,999 --> 00:30:46,309
and ridiculously misinformed legal
threats and also unfortunately most of

543
00:30:46,309 --> 00:30:49,700
us here are not lawyers and do not have
the money to hire them

544
00:30:49,700 --> 00:30:52,740
also unfortunately people like this
kinda late Senator Ted Stevens who

545
00:30:52,740 --> 00:30:53,580
coined the phrase

546
00:30:53,580 --> 00:30:57,470
series of tubes are the ones offering
pieces are important legislation like

547
00:30:57,470 --> 00:31:01,210
the communications consumers choice in
broadband deployment Act 2000 set that

548
00:31:01,210 --> 00:31:01,539
is

549
00:31:01,539 --> 00:31:05,529
that's not a joke we would was but as
that is truth

550
00:31:05,529 --> 00:31:08,950
so it would be great if some others
commercial group that get it want to go

551
00:31:08,950 --> 00:31:09,919
to bat for us

552
00:31:09,919 --> 00:31:12,899
it's almost like the marketing team at
Smart Water having perhaps her to the

553
00:31:12,899 --> 00:31:14,700
internet but maybe never been there

554
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:18,230
have suddenly been put in charge of
legislating while the people

555
00:31:18,230 --> 00:31:21,279
%uh like the people who may be nonstop
usual spot

556
00:31:21,279 --> 00:31:24,559
who seem engaged interested in
knowledgeable about the Internet are you

557
00:31:24,559 --> 00:31:27,918
really even allowed in the chamber with
other folks because you know

558
00:31:27,919 --> 00:31:32,139
that's where the grown-ups are talking a
lot of the people in power who get to

559
00:31:32,139 --> 00:31:35,070
make the decisions that affect the
Internet think we're just a bunch of

560
00:31:35,070 --> 00:31:35,840
credence

561
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:39,889
Pirates perverts and perks and why we we
know that we are not

562
00:31:39,889 --> 00:31:43,429
all the changed or traditions in the
world can't speak louder than them fatty

563
00:31:43,429 --> 00:31:47,330
fat fat cat breezes sweet love with the
health nurse

564
00:31:47,330 --> 00:31:50,418
lobby dollar sign that was the lobby
dollars

565
00:31:50,419 --> 00:31:53,809
so there's a battle that's happening on
the internet a battle for attention you

566
00:31:53,809 --> 00:31:54,658
get the old guard

567
00:31:54,659 --> 00:31:57,909
money media interests battling for you
over your attention with people who are

568
00:31:57,909 --> 00:32:00,909
working all the time for free because
they love the

569
00:32:00,909 --> 00:32:04,740
making things and that's a hard fight to
win so if this battle for your attention

570
00:32:04,740 --> 00:32:05,470
as the battle

571
00:32:05,470 --> 00:32:08,909
on the Internet we've also got the
battle over the Internet

572
00:32:08,909 --> 00:32:12,009
one of the reasons this battle is taking
place is because the kind of

573
00:32:12,009 --> 00:32:15,099
like Madea battle right the big media
interest don't

574
00:32:15,099 --> 00:32:18,960
needed to fight for your attention if
they get to decide who gets to talk on

575
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:19,649
the internet

576
00:32:19,649 --> 00:32:23,299
they just say we get to talk and people
who threaten our profits don't

577
00:32:23,299 --> 00:32:28,019
they don't even need to win the fight on
the Internet if they win the fight

578
00:32:28,019 --> 00:32:32,549
over the Internet the most recent series
contentions for seriously screwing up

579
00:32:32,549 --> 00:32:35,499
the internet via the government were
stringing really really shitty pieces of

580
00:32:35,499 --> 00:32:37,269
legislation so far

581
00:32:37,269 --> 00:32:42,429
people and actor these proposed pieces
of legislation and the responses to them

582
00:32:42,429 --> 00:32:46,109
are very good illustration of the type
of conflict is being worked out

583
00:32:46,109 --> 00:32:48,820
certain monied interests are very happy
paying money money money money money

584
00:32:48,820 --> 00:32:51,480
money money money money money money
money money to lobbyists in order to

585
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:53,220
influence the creation of you know

586
00:32:53,220 --> 00:32:57,009
law while other interested parties don't
necessarily have access to that same

587
00:32:57,009 --> 00:32:57,539
tactic

588
00:32:57,539 --> 00:33:00,960
and they have to take others when sober
and people were building steam to get

589
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:03,450
voted through the internet through
itself a blackout

590
00:33:03,450 --> 00:33:05,940
different site in different companies
did in different ways to the central

591
00:33:05,940 --> 00:33:09,099
idea with the same as a digital strike
of civil disobedience

592
00:33:09,099 --> 00:33:12,259
the sofa blackouts were meant to
illustrate a non-monetary source of

593
00:33:12,259 --> 00:33:13,320
power and influence

594
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:16,899
when you think about it was a kind of
mean it was an idea that some people had

595
00:33:16,899 --> 00:33:20,590
the car on it spread to other people and
they buried it and then pass it on

596
00:33:20,590 --> 00:33:23,669
it's just that instead of making us
laugh it helps keep the internet the way

597
00:33:23,669 --> 00:33:24,259
it is

598
00:33:24,259 --> 00:33:26,960
it's nice to think about the fighter the
internet the little guys first the big

599
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:27,679
guys right

600
00:33:27,679 --> 00:33:31,169
the pier in the writers internet citizen
majority against the evil corporate

601
00:33:31,169 --> 00:33:35,299
overlord minority but the blackout was a
reminder that today's fight over the

602
00:33:35,299 --> 00:33:37,340
Internet in the united states anyway

603
00:33:37,340 --> 00:33:41,529
isn't David versus Goliath its goliath
versus Goliath you have entrenched media

604
00:33:41,529 --> 00:33:44,340
conglomerates verses emerging the
powerful Internet companies

605
00:33:44,340 --> 00:33:48,249
to some extent the final Washington over
the Internet is about what we end users

606
00:33:48,249 --> 00:33:49,179
want

607
00:33:49,179 --> 00:33:53,139
only insofar as our interests align with
corporate interests on one side or the

608
00:33:53,139 --> 00:33:53,619
other

609
00:33:53,619 --> 00:33:56,820
but there are lots of other examples
with the conflict is more direct where

610
00:33:56,820 --> 00:34:00,939
one party is directly against the
government or some other party

611
00:34:00,940 --> 00:34:04,399
take for instance the anti Scientology
protest staged by anonymous

612
00:34:04,399 --> 00:34:07,139
this isn't the king of the hill
contestation over some third separate

613
00:34:07,139 --> 00:34:10,169
goal these two groups never vied for
control the same

614
00:34:10,168 --> 00:34:14,888
up some other thing the conflict was
direct and head to head

615
00:34:14,889 --> 00:34:18,770
and his pattern holds pretty true for
most anonymous is more political actions

616
00:34:18,770 --> 00:34:21,790
for instance one anonymous users came to
the defense WikiLeaks

617
00:34:21,790 --> 00:34:24,909
or went on the offense against web
security firm HB Gary

618
00:34:24,909 --> 00:34:28,700
or any of the various actions performed
by or attributed to low sec

619
00:34:28,700 --> 00:34:32,690
even their involvement in Tunisia had a
distinctly us versus them feel

620
00:34:32,690 --> 00:34:35,569
one notable thing though about all these
actions as how they're organized because

621
00:34:35,569 --> 00:34:36,500
for the most part

622
00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:39,809
without a stricter central form a non
projects look like this

623
00:34:39,809 --> 00:34:42,669
said instructions uploaded to the web in
the hope that others may be dozens maybe

624
00:34:42,668 --> 00:34:44,149
hundreds maybe thousands

625
00:34:44,149 --> 00:34:47,319
might take up these instructions and
contribute to the effort and sometimes

626
00:34:47,319 --> 00:34:48,339
they do

627
00:34:48,339 --> 00:34:51,489
and sometimes they don't which is almost
exactly the same working model the

628
00:34:51,490 --> 00:34:52,919
chinese human flesh search

629
00:34:52,918 --> 00:34:55,399
and we should be careful though
anonymous is a tricky thing to talk

630
00:34:55,399 --> 00:34:57,040
about and it's a topic thats been

631
00:34:57,040 --> 00:35:00,369
perhaps overly fetish I just in the last
few years

632
00:35:00,369 --> 00:35:03,460
people rarely take the time to think
wish between grid the calls itself

633
00:35:03,460 --> 00:35:05,450
anonymous and takes actions as such

634
00:35:05,450 --> 00:35:09,020
various actions taken by connected or
not individuals which are attributed to

635
00:35:09,020 --> 00:35:09,690
anonymous by

636
00:35:09,690 --> 00:35:13,400
others actions that are made anonymously
and we could go on but there are other

637
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:15,810
people who are more qualified to discuss
such matters

638
00:35:15,810 --> 00:35:20,328
be a common the other common in it's no
surprise that and i misses political

639
00:35:20,329 --> 00:35:23,390
actions might be dripping with means a
medic behavior no I mean given you no

640
00:35:23,390 --> 00:35:23,700
reason

641
00:35:23,700 --> 00:35:27,290
web history but there are a lot of local
example that we can talk about the same

642
00:35:27,290 --> 00:35:27,839
way

643
00:35:27,839 --> 00:35:31,140
consider the Tea Party and yet I'm both
the group movement

644
00:35:31,140 --> 00:35:34,180
ideas there each against the government
in their own way

645
00:35:34,180 --> 00:35:37,660
one of the Tea Party's main talking
point is less government an Occupy Wall

646
00:35:37,660 --> 00:35:41,029
Street my not want smaller government
but they are against the business as

647
00:35:41,029 --> 00:35:42,589
usual state in the country

648
00:35:42,589 --> 00:35:46,119
and if we wanna be cute about it with an
Occupy Wall Street is also a mean

649
00:35:46,119 --> 00:35:50,240
it's a central San ideas that can be
transmitted altered and copied

650
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:53,520
in addition though the events
surrounding 0 WS spark more than a few

651
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:57,810
more traditional internet means the most
notable which is this guy

652
00:35:57,810 --> 00:36:00,828
pepper spray cop wasn't actually in New
York City at all

653
00:36:00,829 --> 00:36:03,829
he was on the campus of the University
California Davis and the Internet has

654
00:36:03,829 --> 00:36:05,200
learned oh my

655
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:08,240
the Internet has learned what to do with
images

656
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:15,240
like this

657
00:36:17,849 --> 00:36:20,369
Mister Rogers mister rogers et al

658
00:36:20,369 --> 00:36:27,369
home in Seattle so this kinda thing is
no surprise these days I mean

659
00:36:30,209 --> 00:36:34,519
Everage macros right we love these
things but this is a new twist on a very

660
00:36:34,519 --> 00:36:36,529
old tactic non-violent resistance

661
00:36:36,529 --> 00:36:39,170
I mean during the civil rights movement
martin luther king junior advocated for

662
00:36:39,170 --> 00:36:39,949
nonviolence in

663
00:36:39,949 --> 00:36:43,150
all protests and activities when
something like this is photographed man

664
00:36:43,150 --> 00:36:46,579
walking down the street being viciously
attacked by dogs on leashes held by men

665
00:36:46,579 --> 00:36:47,579
with guns

666
00:36:47,579 --> 00:36:51,839
the image deal would you demise is the
opposition this image works for the

667
00:36:51,839 --> 00:36:53,130
protesters it says

668
00:36:53,130 --> 00:36:56,140
all we're doing is walking and look what
they're doing us

669
00:36:56,140 --> 00:36:59,489
pepper spray cop has been remix over and
over again documenting violence and

670
00:36:59,489 --> 00:37:02,019
abuse to gain support for your causes
old is gonna be really

671
00:37:02,019 --> 00:37:05,599
the guy Martin Luther King learned
non-violence from but the other thing

672
00:37:05,599 --> 00:37:08,190
that we should point out is that in
addition to being a mean

673
00:37:08,190 --> 00:37:12,400
in addition to inspiring means the
Occupy movement also contains

674
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:16,369
several means the user the People's Mic
the use in general assemblies the chance

675
00:37:16,369 --> 00:37:18,989
and slogans and the concept and the 99
percent

676
00:37:18,989 --> 00:37:22,049
all these have become integral part of
what the Occupy movement

677
00:37:22,049 --> 00:37:25,579
is I know these things were created
exclusively by 0 WS all these things

678
00:37:25,579 --> 00:37:26,479
have been tried out by

679
00:37:26,479 --> 00:37:29,569
other protest movements develop and
change then passed on overtime

680
00:37:29,569 --> 00:37:32,859
it does beg the question though how many
occupies how much

681
00:37:32,859 --> 00:37:36,989
occupy spread was made possible because
I've the Internet which is of course the

682
00:37:36,989 --> 00:37:40,099
same kind impossible question the people
have asked about the various events at

683
00:37:40,099 --> 00:37:40,519
the air

684
00:37:40,519 --> 00:37:43,930
spring did Facebook start a revolution
did Twitter overthrow a government

685
00:37:43,930 --> 00:37:46,660
it's not hard to believe the internet
savvy Americans might have a slightly

686
00:37:46,660 --> 00:37:48,989
skewed view on the role the Internet in
the world

687
00:37:48,989 --> 00:37:52,259
what do we mean well as it turns out the
internet is not what

688
00:37:52,259 --> 00:37:56,690
I even a little well okay so maybe a
little but not much more than

689
00:37:56,690 --> 00:38:00,579
the to the matter is that the Internet
is still growing in almost every way

690
00:38:00,579 --> 00:38:03,130
I one thing that we struggle within
struggle to remember is that although we

691
00:38:03,130 --> 00:38:04,849
think the Internet is a global Internet

692
00:38:04,849 --> 00:38:07,880
it really is in a certain sense the
american european internet

693
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:10,769
the cross-cultural warm fuzzies we feel
about being able to visit foreign

694
00:38:10,769 --> 00:38:13,170
website look at foreign media support
foreign causes

695
00:38:13,170 --> 00:38:16,640
really only a poetic importance we are
far from

696
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:20,308
any kind internet saturation point in
vast parts of the globe

697
00:38:20,309 --> 00:38:25,579
notice most in africa is not even
represented on this map and China though

698
00:38:25,579 --> 00:38:27,829
a large segment is only 20 to 40 percent

699
00:38:27,829 --> 00:38:31,519
internet saturation by population and
you're very attractive this idea

700
00:38:31,519 --> 00:38:34,609
user-generated culture as a way to talk
about the state of the world

701
00:38:34,609 --> 00:38:37,749
about the matter that many countries
don't have near as much you generated

702
00:38:37,749 --> 00:38:38,680
content as we do.

703
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:41,669
in many countries that do have the
Internet Harish airing the UGC of

704
00:38:41,670 --> 00:38:43,279
countries with higher saturation

705
00:38:43,279 --> 00:38:47,759
there are American and European means
everywhere so we put on our party has to

706
00:38:47,759 --> 00:38:51,039
celebrate all the great things a global
network accomplished but then we also

707
00:38:51,039 --> 00:38:51,709
put on a

708
00:38:51,709 --> 00:38:55,269
other had knowing full well that the
network is not really global knowing

709
00:38:55,269 --> 00:38:58,529
that this is something we have to work
at a goal we need to be aware of his

710
00:38:58,529 --> 00:39:02,249
programmers researchers anthropologists
artists and even user we're not saying

711
00:39:02,249 --> 00:39:02,729
that

712
00:39:02,729 --> 00:39:05,900
the US internet usage is more important
than any other countries he said

713
00:39:05,900 --> 00:39:09,109
were saying that it can sometimes be
very hard for us to understand

714
00:39:09,109 --> 00:39:12,680
what internet culture is like in other
part places around the globe

715
00:39:12,680 --> 00:39:15,808
me take this example from Brazil for
instance the campaign to save the gal

716
00:39:15,809 --> 00:39:16,799
pal birds

717
00:39:16,799 --> 00:39:19,979
it turns out a few smart million
brazilians noticed that Americans on

718
00:39:19,979 --> 00:39:20,559
Twitter

719
00:39:20,559 --> 00:39:24,079
loved to join what they thought of as
humanitarian causes

720
00:39:24,079 --> 00:39:27,699
countless Twitter users made their
avatar pic green or set their location

721
00:39:27,699 --> 00:39:29,749
to Toronto's for the Iranians

722
00:39:29,749 --> 00:39:32,430
and two years later a lot of people
turned adding the stop so banners to the

723
00:39:32,430 --> 00:39:33,269
bottom of the same

724
00:39:33,269 --> 00:39:36,160
us to lose billions they figured out
that if the Americans are so keen on

725
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:38,288
tweeting in retrieving for various
causes

726
00:39:38,289 --> 00:39:41,670
and so save the gal pal bird campaign
began

727
00:39:41,670 --> 00:39:45,859
asking people to tweet and retweet
Kalibo Galvao in order to save these

728
00:39:45,859 --> 00:39:46,930
endangered birds

729
00:39:46,930 --> 00:39:52,269
except there are no birds and caliber to
go well actually translates to shut up

730
00:39:52,269 --> 00:39:53,099
Calwell

731
00:39:53,099 --> 00:39:57,229
and allows the name I'll be particularly
unpopular Brazilian sportscaster

732
00:39:57,229 --> 00:40:01,160
who look to see

733
00:40:01,160 --> 00:40:04,709
though to be fair as a political example
this one is pretty low stakes

734
00:40:04,709 --> 00:40:08,348
but remember when we mention China
earlier we recently got a chance to see

735
00:40:08,349 --> 00:40:09,329
digital artist

736
00:40:09,329 --> 00:40:12,420
I'm time in murder this and shall mean a

737
00:40:12,420 --> 00:40:15,619
talk about any number of Chinese
Internet means which is good for us

738
00:40:15,619 --> 00:40:18,949
because our tenth research Chinese
Internet means look a lot like this

739
00:40:18,949 --> 00:40:25,390
the poster child for political means in
china is the grass mud horse long story

740
00:40:25,390 --> 00:40:27,650
short the grass mud horse is a mythical
creature that was

741
00:40:27,650 --> 00:40:31,900
invented in order to circumvent China's
tight-fisted digital censorship

742
00:40:31,900 --> 00:40:34,959
the chinese-language apparently is rife
with similar phonemes

743
00:40:34,959 --> 00:40:38,319
so was it hard to pick 3 grass mud horse
or

744
00:40:38,319 --> 00:40:44,929
Cal need Mar which sounds almost exactly
like the characters for fuck your mother

745
00:40:44,929 --> 00:40:47,219
since then there have been even more
plans with the animals that have been

746
00:40:47,219 --> 00:40:50,239
invented but the grass mud horse and
secondly these river crabs

747
00:40:50,239 --> 00:40:53,449
have become the two most popular symbols
of this clever resistance I'll

748
00:40:53,449 --> 00:40:57,349
and the the river crabs

749
00:40:57,349 --> 00:41:01,539
yeah now guys one horse has a pretty
easy time crossing borders but there are

750
00:41:01,539 --> 00:41:03,529
other related practices that we found
out about

751
00:41:03,529 --> 00:41:07,549
all of which are in themselves to
political resistance

752
00:41:07,549 --> 00:41:10,410
if the US Internet is dominated by
businesses who are in control it makes

753
00:41:10,410 --> 00:41:13,479
sense that so much to the user-generated
culture uses commercial or

754
00:41:13,479 --> 00:41:16,979
anti commercial imagery and the Chinese
internet is down by the government that

755
00:41:16,979 --> 00:41:20,009
makes sense that so much of it is
generally culture uses governmental or

756
00:41:20,009 --> 00:41:23,410
anti-government a limit re summer which
to the government censorship of the

757
00:41:23,410 --> 00:41:27,859
Internet has been taken offline into the
streets

758
00:41:27,859 --> 00:41:32,469
seriously though not really are you you
really should lot of great presentations

759
00:41:32,469 --> 00:41:35,819
and now its circle back almost full
circle I we've seen on political means

760
00:41:35,819 --> 00:41:38,549
and political ones I've seen way the
people uncensored communication with

761
00:41:38,549 --> 00:41:40,690
ways the people have circumvented that
censorship

762
00:41:40,690 --> 00:41:43,440
the issues a complicated one when we
don't pretend to know everything about

763
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:46,739
but it important and the relationship
between web culture and political power

764
00:41:46,739 --> 00:41:47,410
or not

765
00:41:47,410 --> 00:41:50,799
only likely to become stronger and more
important I'm sure love you in the

766
00:41:50,799 --> 00:41:52,170
audience familiar with this quote

767
00:41:52,170 --> 00:41:55,539
and if you haven't heard before I'm sure
you can get the gist

768
00:41:55,539 --> 00:41:59,289
this along with slogans like information
must be free and there is porn in net

769
00:41:59,289 --> 00:42:02,739
are big pillars of internet culture
history it's like our I regret I have

770
00:42:02,739 --> 00:42:04,069
but one life to get

771
00:42:04,069 --> 00:42:07,229
or the British are coming but if we
think about the squirrel

772
00:42:07,229 --> 00:42:10,789
we could if we wanted play devil's
advocate and explore

773
00:42:10,789 --> 00:42:14,900
a contradictory view I we started today
by talking about massive the Internet

774
00:42:14,900 --> 00:42:17,410
and in a way this is the first-ever map
on the Internet

775
00:42:17,410 --> 00:42:20,190
this diagram was part of the original
publication that the rest have a

776
00:42:20,190 --> 00:42:22,880
distributed internet work could be
created

777
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:25,660
this was at the time in the world is
very different than it is now the

778
00:42:25,660 --> 00:42:29,029
nuclear arms race in the cold war cause
the US government to consider what would

779
00:42:29,029 --> 00:42:31,219
happen if we were ever bombs

780
00:42:31,219 --> 00:42:34,440
and to the birth of the internet we know
today was a national communications

781
00:42:34,440 --> 00:42:35,769
system to ensure

782
00:42:35,769 --> 00:42:39,179
against nuclear attack this election is
a modified realized how to create

783
00:42:39,179 --> 00:42:42,179
national interstate system right if the
US is ever invaded in wartime

784
00:42:42,179 --> 00:42:45,190
we need several redundant and efficient
systems moving troops from place to

785
00:42:45,190 --> 00:42:45,809
place

786
00:42:45,809 --> 00:42:48,599
accepted by the nineteen sixties we
weren't afraid of germans landing on the

787
00:42:48,599 --> 00:42:49,289
beach

788
00:42:49,289 --> 00:42:52,739
we were freedom this the point being
that

789
00:42:52,739 --> 00:42:56,380
this never happens meaning that you
could argue

790
00:42:56,380 --> 00:42:59,019
if you wanted but the only type of
threat that the Internet is

791
00:42:59,019 --> 00:43:01,319
technologically built to withstand

792
00:43:01,319 --> 00:43:05,390
is this kind the problem censorship
isn't one the Internet as a technology

793
00:43:05,390 --> 00:43:07,788
is programmed to deal with so OK

794
00:43:07,789 --> 00:43:10,949
if reading from censorship isn't hard
coded into the technology the internet

795
00:43:10,949 --> 00:43:12,579
then where does it come from

796
00:43:12,579 --> 00:43:15,279
given everything that we've talked about
so far are answer probably won't

797
00:43:15,279 --> 00:43:16,329
surprise you

798
00:43:16,329 --> 00:43:19,369
it comes from the people we've already
talked about how all

799
00:43:19,369 --> 00:43:22,630
the all-inclusive mister the Internet is
maybe not all that its cracked up to be

800
00:43:22,630 --> 00:43:25,559
but during the first 20 years of its
history basically when the internet had

801
00:43:25,559 --> 00:43:26,630
no world wide web

802
00:43:26,630 --> 00:43:30,369
it was even more non includes meaning
that in general you had a pretty limited

803
00:43:30,369 --> 00:43:33,239
set of characteristics that describes
most that the people making the big

804
00:43:33,239 --> 00:43:34,410
decisions on line white

805
00:43:34,410 --> 00:43:38,379
american middle-class college-educated
male liberal technologist

806
00:43:38,380 --> 00:43:41,449
which just to put it into perspective
we're not claiming that was only the

807
00:43:41,449 --> 00:43:42,099
type to be

808
00:43:42,099 --> 00:43:45,160
that those are the only two other people
who shaped the early Internet but it may

809
00:43:45,160 --> 00:43:47,428
have to think back to our founding
fathers reference

810
00:43:47,429 --> 00:43:50,499
given at a whole lot of decisions about
how the United States

811
00:43:50,499 --> 00:43:53,549
shaped was determined by white American
upper-class

812
00:43:53,549 --> 00:43:57,299
enlightenment influence christian male
good writers

813
00:43:57,299 --> 00:44:00,599
now obviously there are a lot of bad
things that come from the result of this

814
00:44:00,599 --> 00:44:01,440
narrow s

815
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:04,609
and there are a lot of people out there
who say awesome or intelligent things

816
00:44:04,609 --> 00:44:05,069
about

817
00:44:05,069 --> 00:44:08,670
racial issues and is this racist yo is
this racist I was the hell is this

818
00:44:08,670 --> 00:44:09,599
racist

819
00:44:09,599 --> 00:44:13,579
deal with often hilariously with issues
a brace on and offline

820
00:44:13,579 --> 00:44:16,769
feminist frequency deals with
representations and gender and Global

821
00:44:16,769 --> 00:44:19,729
Voices which is organized by even
sacrament is doing its best to get past

822
00:44:19,729 --> 00:44:21,539
the American label as well

823
00:44:21,539 --> 00:44:25,400
but there was also we think one very
good thing to come out at the Mancini

824
00:44:25,400 --> 00:44:28,489
have those early computer science which
is that their belief in a liberal ideal

825
00:44:28,489 --> 00:44:30,739
free speech and free access and free
information

826
00:44:30,739 --> 00:44:33,609
those people and believes are
responsible for structuring many of the

827
00:44:33,609 --> 00:44:34,150
freedoms

828
00:44:34,150 --> 00:44:37,569
that make internet culture what it is
today and this is just as much a

829
00:44:37,569 --> 00:44:40,390
cultural innovation as it is a technical
one

830
00:44:40,390 --> 00:44:42,739
and we should clarify that we don't mean
liberal here in the way that it gets

831
00:44:42,739 --> 00:44:45,829
used on most contemporary news media
liberal is not a shorthand for

832
00:44:45,829 --> 00:44:48,739
democratic to note something more
similar to the founding fathers

833
00:44:48,739 --> 00:44:50,759
Enlightenment ideals than anything else

834
00:44:50,759 --> 00:44:53,829
since probably not too much of an
exaggeration to say that for a while

835
00:44:53,829 --> 00:44:54,349
there

836
00:44:54,349 --> 00:44:58,079
the men diagram circle have sys admins
was pretty much entirely in the much

837
00:44:58,079 --> 00:44:59,289
larger free speech

838
00:44:59,289 --> 00:45:03,229
active a circle but maybe that's no
longer the case

839
00:45:03,229 --> 00:45:07,179
just like the interstate and long been
disassociated from anything militaristic

840
00:45:07,179 --> 00:45:10,859
and taken up by public intent on work
and/or relaxation the Internet has been

841
00:45:10,859 --> 00:45:14,038
distance from its military origins and
flooded with people looking for but

842
00:45:14,039 --> 00:45:15,609
looking to both work and play

843
00:45:15,609 --> 00:45:18,929
and with other energy has come the
commercial interests we describe and

844
00:45:18,929 --> 00:45:22,529
balls commercial interests come a flood
people who maybe aren't the most

845
00:45:22,529 --> 00:45:26,619
liberal or altruistic people when the
goal your job is to increase shareholder

846
00:45:26,619 --> 00:45:28,479
profits to the detriment of

847
00:45:28,479 --> 00:45:32,469
any other goal or value you are less
than likely to stick up for free

848
00:45:32,469 --> 00:45:33,089
expression

849
00:45:33,089 --> 00:45:36,109
and whenever technology proves the news
opportunity to make you a shitload of

850
00:45:36,109 --> 00:45:39,038
money you can bet you're going to get
involved which is to say we can no

851
00:45:39,039 --> 00:45:41,960
longer assume that the Internet as a
whole

852
00:45:41,960 --> 00:45:45,839
is just the home of the good guys or
even one of the good guys itself saying

853
00:45:45,839 --> 00:45:46,229
that

854
00:45:46,229 --> 00:45:50,210
think this would be like saying only
democrats use phones or even phones can

855
00:45:50,210 --> 00:45:52,130
only be used for good but we can't

856
00:45:52,130 --> 00:45:55,880
lose the war on attention we can't I
mean for as long as there have been

857
00:45:55,880 --> 00:45:57,650
people there has been communication

858
00:45:57,650 --> 00:46:01,329
be in its very design affords and
facilitate sharing we

859
00:46:01,329 --> 00:46:05,109
people make the culture like apple trees
make apples it's what we do

860
00:46:05,109 --> 00:46:07,400
to worry about winning the world
attention on the Internet I mean we

861
00:46:07,400 --> 00:46:08,679
can't really lose

862
00:46:08,679 --> 00:46:12,569
but if we lose the war over government
it won't matter we won't have a choice

863
00:46:12,569 --> 00:46:16,339
on the internet anymore user-generated
culture threatens the revenue model the

864
00:46:16,339 --> 00:46:18,229
media conglomerate by its very existence

865
00:46:18,229 --> 00:46:21,999
and as far as the comments are concerned
eyeballs on competing media are a threat

866
00:46:21,999 --> 00:46:23,319
to their bottom line

867
00:46:23,319 --> 00:46:26,659
and the market researchers are working
out how to get you back onto their

868
00:46:26,659 --> 00:46:30,109
contact and lawyers and lobbyists
figuring out how to take away the option

869
00:46:30,109 --> 00:46:31,380
to see or hear anything out

870
00:46:31,380 --> 00:46:34,769
some is never enough in the capitalist
game it is winner take

871
00:46:34,769 --> 00:46:39,039
all countries like China and Iran give
us a window into a world where we've

872
00:46:39,039 --> 00:46:42,049
lost the battle over government and
powerful forces control

873
00:46:42,049 --> 00:46:45,599
who can talk and what they can say on
the Internet censorship in human rights

874
00:46:45,599 --> 00:46:46,849
abuses the take place

875
00:46:46,849 --> 00:46:50,719
in countries like those inspire us to
advocate for change in those countries

876
00:46:50,719 --> 00:46:53,829
and provide a real motivation to win the
battle over government here we don't

877
00:46:53,829 --> 00:46:57,210
want that world for ourselves and we
don't want to pass a Chinese or Iranian

878
00:46:57,210 --> 00:46:59,269
style internet on to our children

879
00:46:59,269 --> 00:47:03,509
but what if we lose whatever Chinese are
Iranian style Internet becomes the model

880
00:47:03,509 --> 00:47:05,049
for the internet world-wide

881
00:47:05,049 --> 00:47:08,119
protecting your corporate or government
interests at the expensive

882
00:47:08,119 --> 00:47:11,599
everyone who isn't a member of the elite
if we lose the battle over government

883
00:47:11,599 --> 00:47:13,449
the next struggle will be a battle

884
00:47:13,449 --> 00:47:17,449
against the Internet a world were forced
to build alternative networks

885
00:47:17,449 --> 00:47:20,650
or take our message is a resistance
exclusively offline were not

886
00:47:20,650 --> 00:47:24,440
scared of this future the very real
possibility that this could happen makes

887
00:47:24,440 --> 00:47:25,390
us angry

888
00:47:25,390 --> 00:47:28,788
the greatest tools ever constructed do
the very thing that separates humankind

889
00:47:28,789 --> 00:47:31,380
from all the other animals in the world
could be turned against

890
00:47:31,380 --> 00:47:35,940
for the financial and political benefit
a people who already have so much money

891
00:47:35,940 --> 00:47:39,929
in power that they spend all their free
time figuring out how to get more

892
00:47:39,929 --> 00:47:43,019
there are a lot of things that we can do
to prevent the future and a lot of

893
00:47:43,019 --> 00:47:46,049
organizations and people here at the
conference you can collaborate with to

894
00:47:46,049 --> 00:47:48,710
make today's Internet better and more
resistance to this kind

895
00:47:48,710 --> 00:47:51,969
more resistant to this kind of top-down
control but still there may come a time

896
00:47:51,969 --> 00:47:53,929
when for the good of all of us

897
00:47:53,929 --> 00:47:58,299
we might actually have to kill the
Internet

898
00:47:58,299 --> 00:48:05,299
thank you thanks

899
00:48:07,770 --> 00:48:14,770
back

900
00:48:16,069 --> 00:48:19,769
are so we have court we have time for
literally one third of a question

901
00:48:19,769 --> 00:48:26,769
actually we only have 60 seconds so
we're gonna go to the back and a few

902
00:48:27,019 --> 00:48:28,129
questions you don't like their

903
00:48:28,129 --> 00:48:30,828
yet we're going back related questions
you can talk to us we'll be hanging out

904
00:48:30,829 --> 00:48:31,459
back there

905
00:48:31,459 --> 00:48:34,839
just follow the sound of the vendor
diagram slowly mmm

906
00:48:34,839 --> 00:48:39,929
mobile thank you mine

907
00:48:39,929 --> 00:48:43,209
