1
00:00:00,049 --> 00:00:04,190
that we're gonna rock and metal styles
are lame on

2
00:00:04,190 --> 00:00:09,490
so I if you're I could same

3
00:00:09,490 --> 00:00:13,660
and maybe at should I think but the
Eagles were by John Ashcroft

4
00:00:13,660 --> 00:00:17,170
no yeah okay anyhow

5
00:00:17,170 --> 00:00:21,560
%uh so I had promised a detailed in
technical look

6
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:25,609
in the abstract and as i put this talk
together and realize how little time I

7
00:00:25,609 --> 00:00:26,140
have

8
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:29,439
arm I can't get too far into the
technologies so

9
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:34,800
I if you want more than a surface level
this is probably not the right talk

10
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:38,420
are you should catch me after the talk
and we can go into more detail

11
00:00:38,420 --> 00:00:42,899
but this is twenty revolution meets
surveillance state now what

12
00:00:42,899 --> 00:00:49,270
um so I'm T profit I have been reading
for 2600 magazine for the last twenty

13
00:00:49,270 --> 00:00:50,620
years now believe it or not

14
00:00:50,620 --> 00:00:53,980
um I read the quarterly telecom informer
column

15
00:00:53,980 --> 00:00:58,660
I and I'm happy to be here in New York
from

16
00:00:58,660 --> 00:01:02,500
on my home in Beijing I the talk today

17
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:06,479
arm is actually about surveillance

18
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:12,000
and the incredibly r pervasive
surveillance that we're now seeing

19
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,250
on telephone and Internet networks
around the world

20
00:01:15,250 --> 00:01:20,290
are so one other things that happened
and the previous talk got into this

21
00:01:20,290 --> 00:01:25,360
in some detail is sab there's been a lot
of political upheaval around the world

22
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:28,759
we've had an Arab Spring and

23
00:01:28,759 --> 00:01:34,130
this gives us a pretty unique
opportunity to actually see

24
00:01:34,130 --> 00:01:38,720
some love the up backed up a revolution
on telecommunications and Internet

25
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:39,960
infrastructure

26
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:44,070
are so before and during the Arab Spring
you know these are these were not free

27
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:44,810
countries

28
00:01:44,810 --> 00:01:47,950
%uh so Internet services were

29
00:01:47,950 --> 00:01:51,970
and continue to be in many cases heavily
monitored on

30
00:01:51,970 --> 00:01:56,298
this is used to gather information an
arrest dissidents

31
00:01:56,299 --> 00:02:00,649
the Tunisian regime was particularly
creative they would actually you read n

32
00:02:00,649 --> 00:02:01,939
changer email

33
00:02:01,939 --> 00:02:06,119
are so you know particular people that
were targeted they would add

34
00:02:06,119 --> 00:02:10,360
do interesting things with male a to
create subterfuge

35
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:14,480
arm and there were a lot of us there
were no I want a sophisticated tools

36
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:15,429
being used

37
00:02:15,430 --> 00:02:19,050
I internet and Burnside began to be shut
off

38
00:02:19,050 --> 00:02:22,830
as revolutions progress because he
eventually the rescue letting people

39
00:02:22,830 --> 00:02:23,650
communicate

40
00:02:23,650 --> 00:02:27,020
actually exceeded the benefit up the
spine

41
00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:31,269
and finally arm in the heated the
battles

42
00:02:31,269 --> 00:02:36,660
other threatening SMS messages were sent
to citizens by the government cell

43
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:40,060
the Egyptian military would send
messages urging people to stay in their

44
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:40,870
homes

45
00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:45,709
I and please just don't go out to the
protests on the Libyan girl government

46
00:02:45,709 --> 00:02:48,430
encouraged people to just give up and go
back to work

47
00:02:48,430 --> 00:02:53,180
and arm we sires similar messages in
Tunisia

48
00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:57,300
I so what's the aftermath of the Arab
Spring a

49
00:02:57,300 --> 00:03:01,950
you know transpire pretty similarly I in
Egypt Tunisia and Libya

50
00:03:01,950 --> 00:03:05,750
with the overthrow love oppressive
governments on all these places but

51
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:07,330
libya is really special

52
00:03:07,330 --> 00:03:10,440
because they're the government entirely
collapsed

53
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:15,300
I like giving head a giving us a rare
look inside domestic and foreign

54
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:16,730
intelligence services

55
00:03:16,730 --> 00:03:20,800
arm despite the spotty history that
Libya has

56
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:26,390
a as see player in the international
community western intelligence services

57
00:03:26,390 --> 00:03:30,590
are working closely with will be at the
time because

58
00:03:30,590 --> 00:03:34,930
there's a principal the enemy of my
enemy is my friend and actually

59
00:03:34,930 --> 00:03:38,010
Gadhafi opposed al Qaeda arm

60
00:03:38,010 --> 00:03:42,489
but lesson learned surveillance is
really more pervasive

61
00:03:42,489 --> 00:03:45,780
than most people can even imagine I'm

62
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:49,790
soap let's talk about what the
landscaper you know crying communication

63
00:03:49,790 --> 00:03:50,519
looks like

64
00:03:50,519 --> 00:03:54,450
there's more ways to communicate than
we've ever had we have twitter we have

65
00:03:54,450 --> 00:03:57,150
base but we have mobile phones we have a
some ass

66
00:03:57,150 --> 00:04:00,659
there's also more surveillance than ever

67
00:04:00,659 --> 00:04:04,609
arm there's a an incredibly creepy
company most people have never heard of

68
00:04:04,610 --> 00:04:05,970
called Pageland here

69
00:04:05,970 --> 00:04:11,510
there's career which is subject to the
communications assistance for Law

70
00:04:11,510 --> 00:04:13,379
Enforcement Act and that enables

71
00:04:13,379 --> 00:04:16,709
an incredible amount of certain
surveillance or telephone switches

72
00:04:16,709 --> 00:04:20,079
there's GPS monitoring up

73
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:23,290
that happens at a very large scale and I

74
00:04:23,290 --> 00:04:27,810
as anybody who saw I'll million penny
stock yesterday and now knows

75
00:04:27,810 --> 00:04:30,900
on the National Security Agency is
building an enormous

76
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:34,900
data center in new tire with an
incredible amount of storage

77
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:38,770
arm so you know this is actually

78
00:04:38,770 --> 00:04:41,889
I'll kind of an interesting point bed I
have

79
00:04:41,889 --> 00:04:46,580
the crib to observe yesterday's cities
held physically band designed to limit

80
00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:47,690
access

81
00:04:47,690 --> 00:04:52,680
and the reason that this is diana's to
conduct pervasive surveillance

82
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:55,850
I if you look at the financial that
works for a long time there bencher

83
00:04:55,850 --> 00:04:58,280
points and financial networks as well

84
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:02,020
and you know the reason for this is to
control the flow of money

85
00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:05,979
well the Internet actually has choke
points as well

86
00:05:05,979 --> 00:05:09,770
and for a long time it was really hard
to monitor these just because of the

87
00:05:09,770 --> 00:05:11,210
sheer amount of traffic

88
00:05:11,210 --> 00:05:15,349
arm but the technology is caught up to
the plane that the internet now can be

89
00:05:15,350 --> 00:05:18,090
considered fully monitored and
controlled just like

90
00:05:18,090 --> 00:05:21,669
telecom just like telephone calls

91
00:05:21,669 --> 00:05:25,849
Internet and telecommunications traffic
is the simply routed through relatively

92
00:05:25,850 --> 00:05:28,250
small number places around the world

93
00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:31,479
are seventy percent roughly have
internet traffic

94
00:05:31,479 --> 00:05:35,430
stop routes through the United States
and storage technology has

95
00:05:35,430 --> 00:05:38,979
has grown incredibly um it's evolved to
the point where

96
00:05:38,979 --> 00:05:43,180
year literally everything wasted a video
I can be logged for a really long

97
00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:45,740
periods of time in NY slater

98
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:49,690
and so you all have a permanent record

99
00:05:49,690 --> 00:05:52,860
arm and it's sitting in a data center

100
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:58,569
you know and bright now probably in for
meat but soon and I you time

101
00:05:58,569 --> 00:06:01,819
there are so many people to spy on for
so many reasons

102
00:06:01,819 --> 00:06:05,509
everyone has a potential threat to
someone else or some government

103
00:06:05,509 --> 00:06:09,110
everyone may have potentially useful
information there's

104
00:06:09,110 --> 00:06:13,400
you know espionage that may be useful to
conducting by one government against

105
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:14,389
another

106
00:06:14,389 --> 00:06:19,180
I if your company you may wanna conduct
are some sort of investigation against

107
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:20,500
your competitors

108
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:24,479
if your government tell you may wonder
know what your political dissidents are

109
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:25,169
doing

110
00:06:25,169 --> 00:06:29,469
arm and we're in this world where
there's all this technology but the

111
00:06:29,470 --> 00:06:31,550
legal constraints are really limited

112
00:06:31,550 --> 00:06:35,050
and they were limited before and they're
even less limited now

113
00:06:35,050 --> 00:06:39,780
a warrantless surveillance has become
the norm in america

114
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:44,400
on it's really easy to justify I'm
there's always some terrorists to catch

115
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:46,440
there's always some emergency

116
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:50,509
there's always some reason to spy and

117
00:06:50,509 --> 00:06:53,639
when it does happen illegally

118
00:06:53,639 --> 00:06:57,569
there's been no penalty for overreach
when it finally comes out that the

119
00:06:57,569 --> 00:06:59,050
government to

120
00:06:59,050 --> 00:07:02,669
is doing something that is
unconstitutional

121
00:07:02,669 --> 00:07:06,190
congress just passes a retroactive lot

122
00:07:06,190 --> 00:07:10,120
and cleans up after it and this has
happened multiple times

123
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:13,830
in the last ten years so

124
00:07:13,830 --> 00:07:17,150
let's take a step back and look where
did all this start because it's actually

125
00:07:17,150 --> 00:07:19,380
a fairly radical concept that

126
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:23,139
%uh literally every communication is
lodged forever

127
00:07:23,139 --> 00:07:28,490
arm because he used to actually take
real work to tap your phone

128
00:07:28,490 --> 00:07:31,610
locally and in the early 1990s

129
00:07:31,610 --> 00:07:35,930
are built monitoring and surveillance
into the telecommunications at work

130
00:07:35,930 --> 00:07:40,410
are so instead it no longer took real
work

131
00:07:40,410 --> 00:07:44,879
the FBI no longer more local police
would no longer have to travel to a

132
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:47,069
telecommunications which

133
00:07:47,069 --> 00:07:50,210
hook up to your phone line and and start
a reporter

134
00:07:50,210 --> 00:07:54,949
they could do all this remotely there
are updates that are currently me being

135
00:07:54,949 --> 00:07:56,750
proposed for Kaliyah laws

136
00:07:56,750 --> 00:08:00,030
arm and this will legitimate

137
00:08:00,030 --> 00:08:03,889
a lot of internet spying that's already
happening up for example

138
00:08:03,889 --> 00:08:07,690
kaliya doesn't have a voice over
Internet services like Skype

139
00:08:07,690 --> 00:08:11,190
on but the FBI would like it to I and

140
00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:14,819
it's very likely that we'll see in the
next year or two I Korea

141
00:08:14,819 --> 00:08:17,990
extended to you literally any way to
communicate

142
00:08:17,990 --> 00:08:21,919
I'll buy waz and also by SMS but there's
more

143
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:26,549
on there's already significant evidence
the technology originally put in place

144
00:08:26,550 --> 00:08:29,060
by kaliya is now routinely used for

145
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:33,620
intercepts that our board authorized end
probably the biggest example of this

146
00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:37,769
is i doing towered amps to determine the
GPS location

147
00:08:37,769 --> 00:08:41,149
a particular cell phone numbers arm and

148
00:08:41,149 --> 00:08:44,649
I love this doesn't even include
national security activities which are

149
00:08:44,649 --> 00:08:46,649
completely under the purview world

150
00:08:46,649 --> 00:08:50,720
I any quarter review at all are based on
the Patriot Act

151
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:53,740
I'm for the most part so if you guys are
interested in

152
00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:57,769
you know what's up what's possible today
what is the FBI telling

153
00:08:57,769 --> 00:09:00,910
telecommunications carriers they need to
be able to do

154
00:09:00,910 --> 00:09:05,410
to enable surveillance on their networks
and just to get an idea of the scope of

155
00:09:05,410 --> 00:09:08,149
this there's actually a website the FBI
runs called

156
00:09:08,149 --> 00:09:12,269
ask Ali I dot com arm you can go sign up

157
00:09:12,269 --> 00:09:17,550
I'll and you know getting to the forum
Nancy other technical documentation on

158
00:09:17,550 --> 00:09:21,260
exactly how this stuff works and and
what carriers need to do

159
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:25,810
arm you know one of the best ways that I
found a social engineer things

160
00:09:25,810 --> 00:09:30,029
is to be a cop reportedly interested in
buying something

161
00:09:30,029 --> 00:09:33,930
and you would be really amazed how much
information you can get if you wanna buy

162
00:09:33,930 --> 00:09:34,890
a switch

163
00:09:34,890 --> 00:09:38,990
war you know if you want to you know
properly implement cally a

164
00:09:38,990 --> 00:09:42,519
in your you know plate environment for
example

165
00:09:42,519 --> 00:09:47,080
arm but Bernard the courts you might ask
because you know it seems like there's

166
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:48,959
an awful lot a surveillance going on

167
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:52,519
and you would think that there'd be some
judicial review

168
00:09:52,519 --> 00:09:56,740
where the reality is quite so mostly
absent are the majority of surveillance

169
00:09:56,740 --> 00:09:58,089
today

170
00:09:58,089 --> 00:10:01,220
is being done without any warrants a
court order seoul

171
00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:05,630
this just came out last week up 1.2
million intercepts were processed by

172
00:10:05,630 --> 00:10:06,329
mobile

173
00:10:06,329 --> 00:10:11,079
carriers last year and that figure
excludes National Security Letter so

174
00:10:11,079 --> 00:10:14,470
we were actually talking about his stuff
that's that's not national

175
00:10:14,470 --> 00:10:17,500
security-related we're talking about 1.2
million there's

176
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:22,560
intercepts happening arm you know every
possible local police departments at the

177
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:25,390
request of the FBI and so forth

178
00:10:25,390 --> 00:10:29,430
and are that means that the true figure

179
00:10:29,430 --> 00:10:32,870
when you factor in national security is
much higher

180
00:10:32,870 --> 00:10:37,750
I N you know this is this could this
kinda blew my mind the number I've

181
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:39,010
intercepts process

182
00:10:39,010 --> 00:10:42,430
just by spreading my own exceeded the
number border

183
00:10:42,430 --> 00:10:45,440
orders issued nationwide so

184
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:49,170
you know one carrier and the intercepts
that they dead arm

185
00:10:49,170 --> 00:10:52,490
you know that's that's a larger number
than a all of the

186
00:10:52,490 --> 00:10:56,279
court orders issued nationwide so you
can see that

187
00:10:56,279 --> 00:11:00,459
reading the police are just going around
the courts and others

188
00:11:00,459 --> 00:11:05,440
really know I am there there doesn't
seem to be any stopping at

189
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:08,910
so it's not just credit bureaus %uh

190
00:11:08,910 --> 00:11:12,040
in the corporate world spying on you
because there's this incredible world

191
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:15,310
not just government surveillance by
corporate surveillance since corporate

192
00:11:15,310 --> 00:11:16,959
surveillance a special

193
00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:20,300
because this is actually treated
differently you don't actually need

194
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:21,890
warrants to look at

195
00:11:21,890 --> 00:11:25,050
most data that companies have a you arm

196
00:11:25,050 --> 00:11:28,470
if the government wants to point out by
that they do need a warrant for that

197
00:11:28,470 --> 00:11:31,660
but they don't need a warrant for your
axiom file and

198
00:11:31,660 --> 00:11:36,310
you know that can actually have every
piece of activity from shopping carts I

199
00:11:36,310 --> 00:11:39,300
you know if you go to Safeway and you
buy something with your Safeway Club

200
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:40,220
Card

201
00:11:40,220 --> 00:11:43,769
at chances are it will wind up in a
database sitting in little rock

202
00:11:43,769 --> 00:11:48,950
on that has a giant buy online you and
your purchasing habits African player

203
00:11:48,950 --> 00:11:51,779
activity banking activity

204
00:11:51,779 --> 00:11:55,510
I'll whether you're at or whether you
are on on whether you might be

205
00:11:55,510 --> 00:11:59,279
interested no mortgage all the stuff is
used for marketing but as he can also be

206
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:00,939
used to track you

207
00:12:00,940 --> 00:12:05,769
arm you have a permanent record and it
sits on a server in arkansas

208
00:12:05,769 --> 00:12:08,959
I'll Internet Service Providers sir
time-warner

209
00:12:08,959 --> 00:12:13,290
as it just came out logs the port number
is a wireless devices use behind

210
00:12:13,290 --> 00:12:15,500
wireless key ways and they do this

211
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:20,279
to help the police identify users that
are required to the just choose you

212
00:12:20,279 --> 00:12:23,399
this is information companies have on
you and

213
00:12:23,399 --> 00:12:26,690
they can just give up without a court
order data mining

214
00:12:26,690 --> 00:12:29,870
I'm said you know power and hear the
company I mentioned before there are

215
00:12:29,870 --> 00:12:32,029
they do a lot of data visualization

216
00:12:32,029 --> 00:12:36,700
artwork on so what are the things that
they can do is

217
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:40,120
try to figure out if your criminal or
terrorist based on the data trail the

218
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:42,639
levy in various databases like

219
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:46,060
you know axiom cell arm maybe a few

220
00:12:46,060 --> 00:12:49,190
by you know fertilizer from one now

221
00:12:49,190 --> 00:12:52,959
one store and you buy some diesel fuel
and you know from shell

222
00:12:52,959 --> 00:12:56,459
they can put the two together and decide
the your terrorist when we meet you know

223
00:12:56,459 --> 00:12:57,389
your farmer

224
00:12:57,389 --> 00:13:00,389
I'm and and you needed for your tractor

225
00:13:00,389 --> 00:13:04,050
arm and you know again this is stop

226
00:13:04,050 --> 00:13:08,820
bed I you don't actually need a court
order to look at you need a warrant to

227
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:09,430
look at

228
00:13:09,430 --> 00:13:12,630
and a many police agencies are using

229
00:13:12,630 --> 00:13:17,160
towards like these I and finally even
Facebook at Wild

230
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:21,060
I kind of expect Facebook to be evil but
they're monitoring chats for suspicious

231
00:13:21,060 --> 00:13:24,720
behavior and you know what they're
really looking for is child predators

232
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:28,100
on I get bad on I have two nieces that

233
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:31,730
I want to keep away from child predators
but arm

234
00:13:31,730 --> 00:13:35,240
you know if you happen to chapters with
younger people arm

235
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:39,490
you know I'm a DJ and a lot of my fans
are younger so if their key words that

236
00:13:39,490 --> 00:13:40,350
pop up

237
00:13:40,350 --> 00:13:45,420
arm you know maybe I might be assumed to
be something I'm not

238
00:13:45,420 --> 00:13:51,290
are so binary arm let's take a look at a
serb a lot steeper post-mortem and you

239
00:13:51,290 --> 00:13:55,260
know some technical details on what was
found in lobby and the reason

240
00:13:55,260 --> 00:13:58,779
that I want to do this is so that you
can kinda been for

241
00:13:58,779 --> 00:14:03,660
are what it may be possible that more
advance governments have

242
00:14:03,660 --> 00:14:08,319
so there's a French company company says
and that's a great ball division

243
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:12,750
good ball was a giant French IT company
and they provided the majority the

244
00:14:12,750 --> 00:14:15,000
infrastructure that was used in Libya

245
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:18,990
arm BSc in the Eagle are monitoring
systems

246
00:14:18,990 --> 00:14:22,220
that they had not sure about a short
demo of are

247
00:14:22,220 --> 00:14:26,670
the legal system on were sold in Morocco
and also to Qatar

248
00:14:26,670 --> 00:14:31,490
on and it's also rumored to be used in
France itself under code name called the

249
00:14:31,490 --> 00:14:36,760
you Hedo PE 1101 so far the French
government's refused to knowledge

250
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:40,269
whether the success story if it does but
its use for

251
00:14:40,269 --> 00:14:43,519
on there was such yes I'm spying

252
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:48,510
a mostly for geo locating are provided
by CT New Year giant Chinese

253
00:14:48,510 --> 00:14:54,069
telecommunications carrier arm they're
also the prime contractors behind the

254
00:14:54,070 --> 00:14:57,190
surveillance system that Iran is
building

255
00:14:57,190 --> 00:15:01,029
and incidentally there currently under
investigation for violating

256
00:15:01,029 --> 00:15:05,689
I US export controls because some other
software that was used in Iran

257
00:15:05,690 --> 00:15:09,839
came from here I'll there's a company
called now rests I

258
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:13,199
owned by a Boeing arm and these

259
00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:17,110
they make the boxes that are believed to
be used by the National Security Agency

260
00:15:17,110 --> 00:15:18,630
here in the US

261
00:15:18,630 --> 00:15:22,670
arm they were solicited to provide
content surveillance and portraying so

262
00:15:22,670 --> 00:15:23,610
they could olds

263
00:15:23,610 --> 00:15:27,170
you know something akin to a Great
Firewall I am Libya

264
00:15:27,170 --> 00:15:31,060
but to their credit arm the revolution
had already gone far enough that they

265
00:15:31,060 --> 00:15:35,100
thought it would be bad for PR so they
refused to proceed any further

266
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:38,230
whether they have now who knows arm

267
00:15:38,230 --> 00:15:42,110
there's a company at a South Africa call
Bob Azteca SA

268
00:15:42,110 --> 00:15:46,680
are they provided us some traditional
landline phone tapping here %uh called

269
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:47,790
zebra

270
00:15:47,790 --> 00:15:51,240
I and finally on

271
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:56,290
so libya had with this collection of
tools the capability to monitor

272
00:15:56,290 --> 00:15:59,360
pretty much all one democrat the traffic
I

273
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:03,259
email instant messaging separate wat web

274
00:16:03,259 --> 00:16:06,279
they did deep packet inspection there
was you know for

275
00:16:06,279 --> 00:16:10,589
packet capture capability they could use
cellular triangulation and monitoring

276
00:16:10,589 --> 00:16:12,670
and this is a country that was a prior

277
00:16:12,670 --> 00:16:17,120
you notice that this is libya this is
not a this is not a nice regime

278
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:21,449
arm you know they had bombed a plane
over an american plane over scotland

279
00:16:21,449 --> 00:16:21,959
this is

280
00:16:21,959 --> 00:16:25,380
you know these are not the best friends
some Western countries

281
00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:28,500
and this is the stuff they got their
hands on

282
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:32,149
I so you can only imagine out what

283
00:16:32,149 --> 00:16:35,459
other countries might have so when we
bounce on a power play

284
00:16:35,459 --> 00:16:40,389
really quickly and hopefully this'll
work iron

285
00:16:40,389 --> 00:16:44,829
be our manual for the Eagle Glen system

286
00:16:44,829 --> 00:16:50,170
I actually leaked arm and that you know
has been put up on Scribd d

287
00:16:50,170 --> 00:16:53,829
I and you know here's an example this is
one thing that I just wanted to show her

288
00:16:53,829 --> 00:16:54,709
arm

289
00:16:54,709 --> 00:16:57,750
so you can actually have our

290
00:16:57,750 --> 00:17:01,070
you feed this system people that you
want to target and it starts gathering

291
00:17:01,070 --> 00:17:02,339
information about them

292
00:17:02,339 --> 00:17:07,669
I it gathers up information from their
cell phones from their ass a mass

293
00:17:07,669 --> 00:17:11,910
are from social networks from email from
their Internet connectivity and starts

294
00:17:11,910 --> 00:17:14,329
walking all the stuff in databases and

295
00:17:14,329 --> 00:17:18,869
arm so at that point you can start
building visualizations around who who

296
00:17:18,870 --> 00:17:21,030
are these people talking to do so

297
00:17:21,030 --> 00:17:24,399
you know if you're a regime when you
wanna smash on

298
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:28,030
a protest you really wanna figure out
you know with the protest leaders are

299
00:17:28,030 --> 00:17:29,789
and then who they're talking to you

300
00:17:29,789 --> 00:17:33,480
because the kinda tell you I who's
involved and then you can

301
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:38,160
you know make all those people disappear
right arm so here it is in a handy dandy

302
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:42,130
little grapple disinformation a computer
just figures out for you

303
00:17:42,130 --> 00:17:45,590
arm you consider the chart on particular

304
00:17:45,590 --> 00:17:50,039
ID's and suspects you can I if you've
done an investigation in New

305
00:17:50,039 --> 00:17:52,640
determined that you know the pizza
delivery guy for this guy's an

306
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:53,630
interesting

307
00:17:53,630 --> 00:17:58,830
I you can remove them on and you know it
just goes on and on in tremseh

308
00:17:58,830 --> 00:18:02,629
up what kind of information you can
target

309
00:18:02,630 --> 00:18:06,690
and track and how you can visualize it
so

310
00:18:06,690 --> 00:18:11,730
up back in the power plant on better

311
00:18:11,730 --> 00:18:14,830
should have to you'll

312
00:18:14,830 --> 00:18:19,110
I there we go on

313
00:18:19,110 --> 00:18:22,520
okay arm so

314
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:27,190
it will be a handle this what does the
US have unfortunately there are not a

315
00:18:27,190 --> 00:18:29,200
lot of backs there's only conjecture

316
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:33,510
I you know we paper all the stuff but
even a congress it's a secret to most

317
00:18:33,510 --> 00:18:34,840
people in congress

318
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:38,740
arm what we were looking at we do know

319
00:18:38,740 --> 00:18:43,310
at least three you know pretty good
conjecture that the NSA had most to the

320
00:18:43,310 --> 00:18:45,950
stock twenty years ago with the actual
one program

321
00:18:45,950 --> 00:18:51,380
arm we know that kaliya has remote
interception capability

322
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:55,520
arm we know that there are secret NSA
intercepts

323
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:58,950
at internet meanie points and so it's
safe to assume that

324
00:18:58,950 --> 00:19:02,550
all Internet traffic nationwide and
passing through the US

325
00:19:02,550 --> 00:19:06,899
is logged and analyzed arm and it's also
safe to assume

326
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:10,090
I'll that as a solid pp answer
compromised

327
00:19:10,090 --> 00:19:13,919
arm assess all our

328
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:17,230
monitoring carey is rich release all the
trade shows

329
00:19:17,230 --> 00:19:20,910
I and on my own experience arm

330
00:19:20,910 --> 00:19:25,560
traveling in countries the that happily
filter and do deep packet inspection and

331
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:28,770
have some by a walk and some
capabilities are bears this out

332
00:19:28,770 --> 00:19:32,160
on the you tie data center I

333
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:36,500
and its tremendous storage capability
wouldn't be being put in place

334
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:41,180
I if they're wasn't big plan we know
that there are

335
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:45,200
carrier logs available even to local
police departments and so

336
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:48,960
out when I say carry a large sweater
does well that's that's so

337
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:53,100
logs that anybody you might die I'll I
anybody who might call you

338
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:56,740
arm any sort of details about your ass a
mask

339
00:19:56,740 --> 00:20:00,240
our conversations all this stuff is
available even a local police

340
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:01,660
departments pretty easily

341
00:20:01,660 --> 00:20:06,460
arm and this is one thing that just came
out be no again last week it runs out

342
00:20:06,460 --> 00:20:08,160
there for seventy five dollars

343
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:13,390
arm if if you're a law enforcement
agency new ask for an AT&T will give you

344
00:20:13,390 --> 00:20:14,060
a dub

345
00:20:14,060 --> 00:20:17,919
love everybody who was at a particular
cell tower in a particular time

346
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:21,490
on and what their GPS location was so

347
00:20:21,490 --> 00:20:24,510
there's plenty of evidence abuse

348
00:20:24,510 --> 00:20:28,140
warrants are now the exception they're
not the norm

349
00:20:28,140 --> 00:20:32,360
there's massive you so wireless email
agency intercepts

350
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:35,660
growing at fifteen percent a year so I
guess we just really have a lot in

351
00:20:35,660 --> 00:20:38,870
emergencies in the US to grow at such a
tremendous raid

352
00:20:38,870 --> 00:20:44,550
as crime is dropping arm there are
secret legal interpretations which is

353
00:20:44,550 --> 00:20:45,860
kinda been interesting

354
00:20:45,860 --> 00:20:50,540
are being so the plain language of the
one may say one thing

355
00:20:50,540 --> 00:20:54,580
I but then the executive branch you know
whether it's democrat or republican

356
00:20:54,580 --> 00:20:55,889
doesn't matter

357
00:20:55,890 --> 00:20:59,890
I decides internally they mean something
completely different and so they have

358
00:20:59,890 --> 00:21:03,310
their own legal interpretation which
they write down in use internally

359
00:21:03,310 --> 00:21:07,570
and that's a secret that's actually you
know not even congress

360
00:21:07,570 --> 00:21:11,330
necessarily knows what the with the
interpretation is

361
00:21:11,330 --> 00:21:15,050
and so we're also up how you implement
that why are based on what the

362
00:21:15,050 --> 00:21:17,330
interpretation is which is sometimes

363
00:21:17,330 --> 00:21:21,970
you know arm 180 degrees from what you
would expect

364
00:21:21,970 --> 00:21:25,280
based on the plain language had a lot
arm

365
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:28,490
Ron Wyden a sitting congressman from
Wake n

366
00:21:28,490 --> 00:21:33,150
has been unable to get clear answers
about the NSA surveillance activities

367
00:21:33,150 --> 00:21:37,570
arm incredibly they've said if they were
to give congress

368
00:21:37,570 --> 00:21:42,350
are more details you would actually be a
violation I love

369
00:21:42,350 --> 00:21:45,800
the privacy of the people that they
might illegally spying on cell

370
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:49,200
I'm a it seems incredible by a TA

371
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:54,470
it's true arm National Security Letters
these are issued by the FBI

372
00:21:54,470 --> 00:21:58,620
yes there be it they care about their

373
00:21:58,620 --> 00:22:02,060
victims arm somebody in the audience
says

374
00:22:02,060 --> 00:22:06,190
up National Security Letters so these
are these were

375
00:22:06,190 --> 00:22:09,680
put in place by the Patriot Act and
basically the if the FBI

376
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:13,590
thanks Ted they want some information
that might have to do with terrorism

377
00:22:13,590 --> 00:22:17,300
they can send a national security writer
you know essentially

378
00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:21,510
could be bi circumventing the courts and
I and demanding information that

379
00:22:21,510 --> 00:22:25,100
previously would have required a warrant
armed and the best part is

380
00:22:25,100 --> 00:22:28,150
you know nobody can tell anybody that
this has happened are

381
00:22:28,150 --> 00:22:32,860
their growing at a very very very fast
trade are all the FBI I'll say

382
00:22:32,860 --> 00:22:36,180
to congress is just the number these
they've issued arm

383
00:22:36,180 --> 00:22:41,160
and act grows every year and out this is
something that's kinda interesting so

384
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:44,220
you might think that it requires a ride
to read your email

385
00:22:44,220 --> 00:22:47,250
are but actually a dozen arm

386
00:22:47,250 --> 00:22:52,180
with just a subpoena the government can
read your Gmail or any online

387
00:22:52,180 --> 00:22:55,550
mail that you may have that's been
stored for more than six months and this

388
00:22:55,550 --> 00:22:58,389
is because the Electronic Communications
Privacy Act

389
00:22:58,390 --> 00:23:04,510
actually requires a wired for the first
six months after that it's fair game

390
00:23:04,510 --> 00:23:09,040
so on let's talk about the american
situation and i really wanna bring you

391
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:10,210
back to

392
00:23:10,210 --> 00:23:15,300
I'll you know the slide love white
things look like in Egypt Tunisia and

393
00:23:15,300 --> 00:23:17,440
Libya had before

394
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:20,940
arm the Arab Spring happen because I

395
00:23:20,940 --> 00:23:24,330
as you as a demonstrated their wares

396
00:23:24,330 --> 00:23:28,500
a lotto surveillance arm that was made
possible in a lot of disruption that was

397
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:30,710
made possible in those regimes

398
00:23:30,710 --> 00:23:36,210
well are July 6 2012 a new executive
order came out called the assignment

399
00:23:36,210 --> 00:23:40,330
national security and emergency
preparedness communications functions

400
00:23:40,330 --> 00:23:43,480
arm so

401
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:46,530
but this actually will enable the
government to deal

402
00:23:46,530 --> 00:23:51,260
arm based on a preliminary
interpretations

403
00:23:51,260 --> 00:23:54,730
by people who would know I is

404
00:23:54,730 --> 00:23:59,310
on the government now can send you SMS
is saying stay in your homes

405
00:23:59,310 --> 00:24:03,050
%uh why don't you stop this protesting
and go back to work

406
00:24:03,050 --> 00:24:08,300
are this no legitimate an Internet kill
switch

407
00:24:08,300 --> 00:24:12,630
a similar to what happened in Egypt
Tunisia and Libya

408
00:24:12,630 --> 00:24:17,610
arm and we're already seeing you know
even without this authorization we saw

409
00:24:17,610 --> 00:24:20,600
cellular service is interrupted during
Occupy were

410
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:26,300
wall street protests are and Oakland
with that but the bar police doing that

411
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:29,570
on landline phones you know the
technology is already there too easily

412
00:24:29,570 --> 00:24:30,889
shut them off

413
00:24:30,890 --> 00:24:35,670
arm n you know this is all really
routine stop in authoritarian countries

414
00:24:35,670 --> 00:24:36,740
I mean

415
00:24:36,740 --> 00:24:40,450
you know in many parts of the world I'll

416
00:24:40,450 --> 00:24:44,400
you know russia and so forth we wouldn't
even think twice whether the government

417
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:46,360
you know should have the ability to do
this

418
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:50,860
arm in the United States baby the
government spent a little bit behind

419
00:24:50,860 --> 00:24:54,410
are but with this executive order
they've now caught up to you

420
00:24:54,410 --> 00:24:58,540
you know great regimes like Syria and
Sudan and I and Russia

421
00:24:58,540 --> 00:25:03,590
with the capabilities that the
government now has in the United States

422
00:25:03,590 --> 00:25:07,060
on whether that's a good thing

423
00:25:07,060 --> 00:25:11,750
I really is up to citizens so could a
Twitter revolution happen here and you

424
00:25:11,750 --> 00:25:14,650
know this is this is a really
interesting question because we all saw

425
00:25:14,650 --> 00:25:15,710
what happened with

426
00:25:15,710 --> 00:25:19,720
Occupy Wall Street last summer are

427
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:24,090
I have on you know I've been sitting
outside the country for a couple years

428
00:25:24,090 --> 00:25:26,459
and so AM I have kinda but

429
00:25:26,460 --> 00:25:30,740
a you know a skewed vision no what's
actually happening but from

430
00:25:30,740 --> 00:25:35,320
you know americans who who visited be in
China I've been told that was pretty big

431
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:38,870
and I've also been told the media kinda
minimized to harm

432
00:25:38,870 --> 00:25:42,570
what the what this actually was arm

433
00:25:42,570 --> 00:25:46,590
well I don't think that we should have a
twitter a pollution necessary not the

434
00:25:46,590 --> 00:25:48,490
same way as

435
00:25:48,490 --> 00:25:52,340
you know Libya or Egypt or Tunisia

436
00:25:52,340 --> 00:25:56,860
because unlike those countries here in
the United States we can in theory

437
00:25:56,860 --> 00:25:58,950
change our government non-violently

438
00:25:58,950 --> 00:26:03,220
through peaceful protest in your actions
you know the real question is would this

439
00:26:03,220 --> 00:26:04,770
be allowed to happen

440
00:26:04,770 --> 00:26:08,590
I think we should keep faith in
democracy and try

441
00:26:08,590 --> 00:26:13,400
however the US has a history of smashing
the international workers at the world

442
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:17,160
I also known as the water please the
Socialists with the

443
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:20,450
presidential campaign of Eugene dads and
you know

444
00:26:20,450 --> 00:26:23,920
better ride I'm not left us by any means
but the

445
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:28,060
on leftist groups so that have I have
borne the brunt

446
00:26:28,060 --> 00:26:32,950
love arm a government very interested in
maintaining the established order

447
00:26:32,950 --> 00:26:38,140
are we have some recent evidence bed I
if things get you far away from

448
00:26:38,140 --> 00:26:42,460
you know the people who are in charge in
the policies that are currently in place

449
00:26:42,460 --> 00:26:46,380
I'll they're likely to be smashed
democracy be damned

450
00:26:46,380 --> 00:26:51,830
and I'm we saw Occupy Wall Street
protests smashed in DHS coordinated

451
00:26:51,830 --> 00:26:52,850
actions by an

452
00:26:52,850 --> 00:26:55,980
a pretty militarized police force arm

453
00:26:55,980 --> 00:27:00,310
we've seen strategic arrests a protest
leaders said suspiciously strategic

454
00:27:00,310 --> 00:27:01,190
times

455
00:27:01,190 --> 00:27:04,820
and what this does is it really points
to a lot of data mining and surveillance

456
00:27:04,820 --> 00:27:08,020
arm which probably is legal arm

457
00:27:08,020 --> 00:27:11,500
and it were even seen Twitter feeds
being subpoenaed and Twitter direct

458
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:12,310
messages

459
00:27:12,310 --> 00:27:16,510
arm you know to find out whether
somebody organize protesters to walk

460
00:27:16,510 --> 00:27:18,100
across the Brooklyn Bridge

461
00:27:18,100 --> 00:27:21,610
on my god up how

462
00:27:21,610 --> 00:27:24,620
terrorist so I'll

463
00:27:24,620 --> 00:27:29,350
I think that if you see political change
in the United States are really anywhere

464
00:27:29,350 --> 00:27:30,550
tactics matter

465
00:27:30,550 --> 00:27:34,720
are so groups seeking political change
need to assume that the end

466
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:38,030
traded they need to assume that they're
being monitored by the same tools and

467
00:27:38,030 --> 00:27:42,070
government organizations that are used
against serious hardcore terrorists

468
00:27:42,070 --> 00:27:46,909
are all this stuff is there arm and it's
just too easy

469
00:27:46,910 --> 00:27:51,830
RT you said arm so will see anti-war
movements

470
00:27:51,830 --> 00:27:55,280
infiltrated and smashed um

471
00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:58,510
I think that we're likely to see if we
ever saw some serious independent

472
00:27:58,510 --> 00:28:02,170
political campaigns away from the
Democrats and Republicans that run

473
00:28:02,170 --> 00:28:03,280
things now

474
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:07,210
I think that we would be see similar
activity

475
00:28:07,210 --> 00:28:11,710
on and so I'd like to ask the questions
well if you combine the mccarthy era

476
00:28:11,710 --> 00:28:15,960
with today's surveillance tools and laws
but with the result urban

477
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:20,160
I if you combine the government smashing
about the water please

478
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:23,900
with the current landscape are what
would have been the result

479
00:28:23,900 --> 00:28:26,970
and you know what's happened

480
00:28:26,970 --> 00:28:32,940
is violence against peaceful protesters
is really now the norm in america

481
00:28:32,940 --> 00:28:37,740
so I liked you call people to action

482
00:28:37,740 --> 00:28:40,960
I and the call to action in the hacker
community

483
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:45,310
are typically is banned we need strong
easy to use encryption everywhere

484
00:28:45,310 --> 00:28:49,730
well I don't think so just kidding the
government's going to break it

485
00:28:49,730 --> 00:28:53,310
arm the fact that we don't care a whole
lot have complained over

486
00:28:53,310 --> 00:28:58,250
consumer encryption anymore says to me
that breaking it is pretty trivial

487
00:28:58,250 --> 00:29:02,310
and Owen small governments

488
00:29:02,310 --> 00:29:08,080
I in parts of the world that are not
particularly primary can buy

489
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:11,330
here to break SSL I this is

490
00:29:11,330 --> 00:29:15,389
not something that's probably going to
work I if you want to maintain your

491
00:29:15,390 --> 00:29:19,200
privacy and if you actually want to be
able to communicate

492
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:22,280
controversy of things but controversy or
people

493
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:26,139
arm word you know the United Kingdom if
you happen to forget your past brace

494
00:29:26,140 --> 00:29:27,410
then it's a poor year

495
00:29:27,410 --> 00:29:30,720
you know president healthy anyway for
contempt of court you know contempt is

496
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:31,720
assumed

497
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:35,870
the same thing can and probably will
happen here

498
00:29:35,870 --> 00:29:40,620
any bad idea that England has seems to
become one the United States

499
00:29:40,620 --> 00:29:44,260
arm I think we need updated lives there

500
00:29:44,260 --> 00:29:48,100
really more appropriately balance the
legitimate needs a1/4 spend and

501
00:29:48,100 --> 00:29:51,620
you know I have a lot of respect for

502
00:29:51,620 --> 00:29:54,660
for people who were doing a really tough
job in law enforcement you know there

503
00:29:54,660 --> 00:29:57,910
really are bad people out there and they
really are doing bad stuff

504
00:29:57,910 --> 00:30:01,300
and so I don't want to minimize that on
there

505
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:05,000
there really are child predators there
really are people running guns that

506
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:05,880
shouldn't be

507
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:09,810
arm we need to be able to stop bad as a
society but

508
00:30:09,810 --> 00:30:14,428
there does a balance and that balances
the legitimate privacy rights of

509
00:30:14,429 --> 00:30:15,480
citizens

510
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:20,050
arm so I think that in particular the
Electronic Communications Privacy Act

511
00:30:20,050 --> 00:30:21,580
ECPA

512
00:30:21,580 --> 00:30:24,649
really needs to be updated to reflect
the world of social networking and

513
00:30:24,650 --> 00:30:26,510
long-term email storage

514
00:30:26,510 --> 00:30:31,090
your Facebook feed shouldn't necessarily
be public domain if you don't want it to

515
00:30:31,090 --> 00:30:31,510
be

516
00:30:31,510 --> 00:30:35,960
on your email shouldn't necessarily be
very easy to GAD just because it's more

517
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:36,960
than six months or

518
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:40,810
the technologies side changed but the
wise happen

519
00:30:40,810 --> 00:30:44,399
arm it's really really too easy for the
government to conduct

520
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:48,960
warrantless surveillance arm so I think
that actually yeah if you're seeking

521
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:50,490
political change

522
00:30:50,490 --> 00:30:53,960
this is really important because the
fact that it's so easy

523
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:57,020
means that it probably will be done and
it also means

524
00:30:57,020 --> 00:31:00,910
more like Queen the your adversary is
real easy

525
00:31:00,910 --> 00:31:05,230
so if you happen to run an independent
political campaign

526
00:31:05,230 --> 00:31:09,540
arm use guerrilla tactics employees
misdirection

527
00:31:09,540 --> 00:31:13,310
on and I think actually need yet another
idea bob is really going to happen in

528
00:31:13,310 --> 00:31:14,780
the at the crime

529
00:31:14,780 --> 00:31:18,510
fundamentally corrupt political regime
that we have now

530
00:31:18,510 --> 00:31:21,540
are so fighting for change

531
00:31:21,540 --> 00:31:25,668
can really only happen by becoming the
change and

532
00:31:25,669 --> 00:31:31,280
with bad from I'd actually be playable s
up for Q&A

533
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:35,428
our want to encourage you guys I run for
public office myself

534
00:31:35,429 --> 00:31:38,530
and and it takes around ten years

535
00:31:38,530 --> 00:31:42,399
I'll working your way up from a local
office to the point where you can

536
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:44,190
actually credibly run

537
00:31:44,190 --> 00:31:48,460
are for a serious federal office

538
00:31:48,460 --> 00:31:52,620
and politics is really dirty by

539
00:31:52,620 --> 00:31:55,840
entertain it takes a really long time to
be able to

540
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:59,500
I'll work your way up throughout the
system but the reality is that the kind

541
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:02,960
to people that are going into politics
are not the kinds of people

542
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:06,480
that probably as hackers we want their
so

543
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:10,940
complaining about shit out but the
government guys is a strategy becoming

544
00:32:10,940 --> 00:32:14,620
the government is a strategy and again
the United States

545
00:32:14,620 --> 00:32:17,800
unlike many places are banned and I like

546
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:21,770
where I currently wear we have the
ability to change our government through

547
00:32:21,770 --> 00:32:22,760
elections

548
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:27,160
so arm given that that's all right that
we have

549
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:31,960
we review part 2 not only vote for
people that we want to be

550
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:35,800
the it in congress and making these laws
but

551
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:39,169
seriously consider getting involved
yourself and even if you don't want to

552
00:32:39,169 --> 00:32:40,710
run for office yourself

553
00:32:40,710 --> 00:32:44,990
if you're on a congressional staff you
will have influence access

554
00:32:44,990 --> 00:32:49,980
bed ordinarily hackers don't get so
please get involved and with batch

555
00:32:49,980 --> 00:32:53,850
I'll open up russians

556
00:32:53,850 --> 00:32:57,580
way

557
00:32:57,580 --> 00:33:01,420
westerns don't have to be about this
subject by the way if you guys are

558
00:33:01,420 --> 00:33:04,400
interested in anything ever written
about in previous columns

559
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:08,140
arm if you're interested in just
anything in telecommunications in

560
00:33:08,140 --> 00:33:08,750
general

561
00:33:08,750 --> 00:33:12,080
feel free to ask I

562
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:18,170
I am you said that I am it's safe to
assume that

563
00:33:18,170 --> 00:33:21,920
SSL VPN have been compromised arm

564
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:25,930
at a very interesting in bold statement
to make would you care to elaborate on

565
00:33:25,930 --> 00:33:26,760
that please

566
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:32,090
sure so there are markets where you can
buy it Aguirre intended

567
00:33:32,090 --> 00:33:36,540
what's called love letters action arm
that's all psyched about a few other

568
00:33:36,540 --> 00:33:38,760
things that have happened just in the
last year

569
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:43,410
I'll we've seen so first of all let's
talk about SS I'll just

570
00:33:43,410 --> 00:33:46,760
just in general I think actually you
know when you when you look at the

571
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:48,540
vendors involved in PP ans

572
00:33:48,540 --> 00:33:53,180
arm its it's very similar so what is SSL
fundamentally

573
00:33:53,180 --> 00:33:57,010
arm how do you trust that while when
your browser skewing

574
00:33:57,010 --> 00:34:01,580
is it's looking at a website and seeing
does that website have a certificate

575
00:34:01,580 --> 00:34:04,750
I and is it issued by a trusted
certificate authority

576
00:34:04,750 --> 00:34:09,380
well then you have to look at your who
was a trusted certificate authority and

577
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:13,110
actually like it said sure enough trust
REIT so you can have

578
00:34:13,110 --> 00:34:16,120
at trusted root CA and then

579
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:19,440
you know a couple of degrees of
separation under that you have

580
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:23,650
you know a certificate the chains up to
that and your browser will actually be

581
00:34:23,650 --> 00:34:25,340
just fine as long as

582
00:34:25,340 --> 00:34:29,100
everything appears kosher battle their
armor

583
00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:32,440
their governments I there are people and
our

584
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:35,820
you know this is a simplified
explanation right so you know trust me

585
00:34:35,820 --> 00:34:36,430
ahead

586
00:34:36,429 --> 00:34:40,460
I'm I'm and I'm an IT guy and my real
life I know it's a lot more complicated

587
00:34:40,460 --> 00:34:42,120
we've got limited time

588
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:47,179
but the reality is do you think

589
00:34:47,179 --> 00:34:50,949
that every certificate authority that
chains our

590
00:34:50,949 --> 00:34:54,949
to a ritzy aim Remi really

591
00:34:54,949 --> 00:34:58,009
can be influenced by government
somewhere

592
00:34:58,010 --> 00:35:01,620
and that's actually what you're up
against rate so if you happen to be in

593
00:35:01,620 --> 00:35:01,970
some

594
00:35:01,970 --> 00:35:05,230
whether the world that's that's a pretty
dangerous corner and

595
00:35:05,230 --> 00:35:08,770
are you dealing with the internet this
using very sophisticated deep packet

596
00:35:08,770 --> 00:35:10,210
inspection software

597
00:35:10,210 --> 00:35:14,230
arm do you think things can
strategically be replaced

598
00:35:14,230 --> 00:35:19,070
I can tell you're arm based on my
experience they can

599
00:35:19,070 --> 00:35:23,950
and if you look at pp ans must be cancer
commercial you can sway

600
00:35:23,950 --> 00:35:28,120
pp commercial be plans have lawful
interception capabilities built into

601
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:29,460
them in many cases

602
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:33,390
so with open bpm baby you can trust that

603
00:35:33,390 --> 00:35:36,830
but can you trust what's in between and
that's you had

604
00:35:36,830 --> 00:35:40,860
there's %uh there are a whole host a man
in the middle attacks that can and do

605
00:35:40,860 --> 00:35:41,470
work

606
00:35:41,470 --> 00:35:45,730
that's watchin okay on two things one

607
00:35:45,730 --> 00:35:49,550
I'm just address the SSL issue very
quickly I'm

608
00:35:49,550 --> 00:35:53,190
buddy just TSN certificate pending I'm
mitigate was the rest you've indicated

609
00:35:53,190 --> 00:35:54,320
in SSL

610
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:58,790
and as far as commercial bank and gaza
member goes attack me which bucket is

611
00:35:58,790 --> 00:35:59,920
issued by the corporate

612
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:04,150
but authority who's doing that so we
don't have a problem validating

613
00:36:04,150 --> 00:36:07,550
and protecting the corporate VPN his
career he began his change the route

614
00:36:07,550 --> 00:36:08,460
which the corporate rig

615
00:36:08,460 --> 00:36:12,860
so but thats action on my question and I
just got a question yes I should like

616
00:36:12,860 --> 00:36:14,500
don't think you have a full
understanding

617
00:36:14,500 --> 00:36:18,010
analysis of functions in reality I'm

618
00:36:18,010 --> 00:36:21,150
there are other broken implementations
as a solemn that's one thing to keep in

619
00:36:21,150 --> 00:36:24,710
mind I know so we're not talking about
protecting the people in this room

620
00:36:24,710 --> 00:36:28,570
well over what you need to be smart
enough to do that you but do you think

621
00:36:28,570 --> 00:36:32,690
do you think every implementation a
vessel everywhere totally works and

622
00:36:32,690 --> 00:36:35,430
never is compromised and you know you
can say that

623
00:36:35,430 --> 00:36:38,779
then I don't know he's got ability to
technology has a problem

624
00:36:38,780 --> 00:36:42,600
okay I was about to pressure the other
such as consensus

625
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:46,020
isolated ninja reasonable people can
disagree right I have a pessimistic view

626
00:36:46,020 --> 00:36:48,980
unless I actually think that we should
always assume the worst

627
00:36:48,980 --> 00:36:52,880
my arm you know obviously hackers like
to solve problems and yet you if you can

628
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:55,920
figure out a way to solve this problem
where you you're on a hostile at work

629
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:56,550
always

630
00:36:56,550 --> 00:37:00,490
and rub against adversaries with I'm
limited time an unlimited resources

631
00:37:00,490 --> 00:37:04,520
and the ability to store traffic Weber
and bang on it with

632
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:07,850
incredible incredible computation
resources then

633
00:37:07,850 --> 00:37:11,210
you know I would very much invite
everyone to solve that problem in a

634
00:37:11,210 --> 00:37:12,520
really easy to use way

635
00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:15,990
and get some momentum okay I'll my
question is is

636
00:37:15,990 --> 00:37:20,950
I'm as far as I'm goes I'm do you
actually find evidence that

637
00:37:20,950 --> 00:37:23,970
there was not room a requirement for a
warrant

638
00:37:23,970 --> 00:37:28,760
I had to get information about
individuals cuz your comment regarding

639
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:32,600
know how you could get our users call
record I'm

640
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:36,460
dust that's provided by subpoena but as
far as my understanding aka goes

641
00:37:36,460 --> 00:37:40,020
you must have a warrant in order to get
contents ok if you could just have a

642
00:37:40,020 --> 00:37:41,230
great osha

643
00:37:41,230 --> 00:37:45,580
so you can get the meat so that's
absolutely true I you can get the mean

644
00:37:45,580 --> 00:37:49,190
who sending mail and who's receiving and
the subject line and the date

645
00:37:49,190 --> 00:37:53,190
and the time with the with the subpoena
if you want the actual content that does

646
00:37:53,190 --> 00:37:55,180
require wired even after six months

647
00:37:55,180 --> 00:37:58,770
the thing is who your talking to you is
is most at the data the law enforcement

648
00:37:58,770 --> 00:37:59,240
once

649
00:37:59,240 --> 00:38:03,140
the content matters a lot last

650
00:38:03,140 --> 00:38:06,870
alright and I Eva galperin attract
Frontier Foundation

651
00:38:06,870 --> 00:38:11,410
track you make a very interesting claim
in the middle if your talk

652
00:38:11,410 --> 00:38:16,009
I hate you use or to tell gonna go
slides coulda Twitter revolution happen

653
00:38:16,010 --> 00:38:16,920
here

654
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:21,310
and I think before you can really
grapple with that question

655
00:38:21,310 --> 00:38:26,580
%um a can you demonstrate that a Twitter
revolution has happened anywhere ever

656
00:38:26,580 --> 00:38:29,730
well so that's a very good point

657
00:38:29,730 --> 00:38:33,750
I'll the revolutions in you know it when
you look at

658
00:38:33,750 --> 00:38:37,220
popular media the revolutions in Egypt

659
00:38:37,220 --> 00:38:41,780
in Tunisia and in in Libya were called
largely called for the revolutions and

660
00:38:41,780 --> 00:38:43,580
so it's kinda become a catch phrase

661
00:38:43,580 --> 00:38:47,890
is it really it was a revolution now I
ross et a bad

662
00:38:47,890 --> 00:38:52,180
especially in Egypt Twitter and Facebook
were organizing tools that work

663
00:38:52,180 --> 00:38:54,169
effectively used by protesters

664
00:38:54,170 --> 00:38:58,280
arm at least in the early stages
obviously you later on when the internet

665
00:38:58,280 --> 00:39:00,110
was shut off they were less useful

666
00:39:00,110 --> 00:39:03,140
but at that point arm you know being
silly

667
00:39:03,140 --> 00:39:06,480
had kind of gotten to the point where
you been shut off the internet and even

668
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:08,960
shutting off cell phone store then stop
in

669
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:15,960
Sona I

670
00:39:16,310 --> 00:39:20,900
I yeah I I i can download

671
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:25,360
address your YouTube a I'm applaud you
for the %uh the call to action

672
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:29,120
at the at the end of the speech and

673
00:39:29,120 --> 00:39:34,759
but I had %um in occupy politics land
when people talk about revolution and

674
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:35,480
themes

675
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:39,360
its kind of those kinda this dichotomy
between a you know the reformers who

676
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:41,900
like let's get into politics and change
the system

677
00:39:41,900 --> 00:39:45,260
and the you know people were more
interested in resistance words Lake

678
00:39:45,260 --> 00:39:48,640
take the streets you know tear down
tonight very clear

679
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:51,740
I'm not involved in Occupy at all I
don't even live in the united states

680
00:39:51,740 --> 00:39:52,560
suffered a

681
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:55,630
that that's cool but there there's also
a go to a third way

682
00:39:55,630 --> 00:39:58,730
and Mike and especially when I think
about what people who have

683
00:39:58,730 --> 00:40:03,520
the are we're very confident in my
computer and software and server

684
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:06,500
you know administration things like that
there's a third way that's really

685
00:40:06,500 --> 00:40:10,150
important and gained getting a lot of
momentum in Occupy which is the mutual

686
00:40:10,150 --> 00:40:10,940
aid

687
00:40:10,940 --> 00:40:15,130
portion like technology which is like
you know there's open source offer for

688
00:40:15,130 --> 00:40:17,530
education there's open source software

689
00:40:17,530 --> 00:40:20,600
you know there's open source offer that
can help schools they can help hospitals

690
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:21,250
they can

691
00:40:21,250 --> 00:40:24,820
to all these amazing things most people
in these bureaucracies

692
00:40:24,820 --> 00:40:28,340
that are dealing with you know the
everyday work

693
00:40:28,340 --> 00:40:32,120
love like been maintaining the school's
technology infrastructure

694
00:40:32,120 --> 00:40:35,319
I don't are using the open source
options and the

695
00:40:35,320 --> 00:40:39,500
aren't they don't have people might like
making themselves available to help them

696
00:40:39,500 --> 00:40:41,410
see like an alternative way

697
00:40:41,410 --> 00:40:46,000
to label run time do you know to do like
the the basic services that people need

698
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:49,590
so I'm curious if and

699
00:40:49,590 --> 00:40:53,100
if you see in if you think that the the
hacker community

700
00:40:53,100 --> 00:40:57,290
the headlight will lead what one would
need

701
00:40:57,290 --> 00:41:00,340
to motivate the hacker community to
kinda make themselves

702
00:41:00,340 --> 00:41:04,260
available to are more available to

703
00:41:04,260 --> 00:41:08,410
you know local institutions that are
providing education and health services

704
00:41:08,410 --> 00:41:12,779
or like worked with you know Mike street
medics and people like that

705
00:41:12,780 --> 00:41:16,990
to the to provide them like software
solutions that they can use to do you

706
00:41:16,990 --> 00:41:19,200
like to do revolutionary activity

707
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:22,100
to work more with non-profit
organizations and maintain more web

708
00:41:22,100 --> 00:41:22,860
sites like

709
00:41:22,860 --> 00:41:27,520
how how do we infuse a social activism

710
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:30,880
into hacker culture without it being
about encryption being at more about

711
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:32,980
providing services to people

712
00:41:32,980 --> 00:41:36,070
I think that it's a good point bed as
hackers

713
00:41:36,070 --> 00:41:39,230
if we're involved in our communities and
people get to know us

714
00:41:39,230 --> 00:41:44,400
I that always gives us more visibility
the focus of my talk

715
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:50,100
is actually governments largely doing
things with technology and not thinking

716
00:41:50,100 --> 00:41:51,990
through the implications rain

717
00:41:51,990 --> 00:41:55,770
we have a pretty massive surveillance
infrastructure that Sen place

718
00:41:55,770 --> 00:42:00,400
on it's getting more massive and all
this has happened

719
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:05,150
are really without a huge amount of
thought to

720
00:42:05,150 --> 00:42:08,250
what the long-term impact could be right

721
00:42:08,250 --> 00:42:11,770
are what is the real impact of having a
permanent record

722
00:42:11,770 --> 00:42:15,910
where you can never make a mistake I'll
work everything that you do like every

723
00:42:15,910 --> 00:42:18,720
piece upon that you download when you're
18 years old

724
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:22,680
you know become something that the is
prominently in a file someplace

725
00:42:22,680 --> 00:42:26,089
that the government can look at any time
that they want to and

726
00:42:26,090 --> 00:42:31,570
you know this isn't conjecture right
like to some degree it is but

727
00:42:31,570 --> 00:42:34,900
when you look at the twins that are
available today and you look at how

728
00:42:34,900 --> 00:42:36,870
powerful these tools are

729
00:42:36,870 --> 00:42:42,920
to you regimes that really are nice ones
and don't get the best walls

730
00:42:42,920 --> 00:42:48,190
I'll you can property wall bed that
actually is the reality that we bought

731
00:42:48,190 --> 00:42:52,130
should we have done that as a society
and how are we going to deal with that

732
00:42:52,130 --> 00:42:53,140
in the future

733
00:42:53,140 --> 00:42:56,950
I and this is actually something that I
think that as hackers

734
00:42:56,950 --> 00:43:00,930
we really need to get involved in a big
way in politics because we understand

735
00:43:00,930 --> 00:43:03,940
the stuff we actually understand the
power

736
00:43:03,940 --> 00:43:08,500
are the technology and we understand
ways more importantly

737
00:43:08,500 --> 00:43:11,750
to use the technology

738
00:43:11,750 --> 00:43:15,950
against Rio threats and it builds
technology

739
00:43:15,950 --> 00:43:20,660
techno technical controls such that it
can't be used against whites that aren't

740
00:43:20,660 --> 00:43:21,270
real

741
00:43:21,270 --> 00:43:24,300
and that's really what I'd like to see

742
00:43:24,300 --> 00:43:28,130
thanks

743
00:43:28,130 --> 00:43:32,240
I think so much for me for your time I
missed criminal and civil litigator from

744
00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:33,310
San Francisco

745
00:43:33,310 --> 00:43:37,009
he made a really interesting point
sometime during years discussion

746
00:43:37,010 --> 00:43:41,340
pointing out a number of circumstances
and am concluding that

747
00:43:41,340 --> 00:43:44,760
her violence and ICM physical violence
is

748
00:43:44,760 --> 00:43:48,600
becoming the norm dealing with
non-violent protests

749
00:43:48,600 --> 00:43:52,210
sure if you look at the Occupy Wall
Street protests out you know is a matter

750
00:43:52,210 --> 00:43:53,040
for example

751
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:57,860
I I consider spraying a student in the
basic close range with you know

752
00:43:57,860 --> 00:44:01,850
hope serious high-pressure pepper spray
to be pretty violent

753
00:44:01,850 --> 00:44:05,920
arm its good

754
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:10,070
he had technically in admo go up into
the gene in Geneva Conventions somebody

755
00:44:10,070 --> 00:44:11,470
in the audience points out

756
00:44:11,470 --> 00:44:16,840
arm I think that anytime you see an old
but there's a large-scale protests

757
00:44:16,840 --> 00:44:18,530
recently in the United States

758
00:44:18,530 --> 00:44:23,390
arm thats its it's a it's a normal
expectation that the police will be

759
00:44:23,390 --> 00:44:24,640
violent

760
00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:29,420
okay cell and and so you're mentioning
the Occupy protests as an example and i

761
00:44:29,420 --> 00:44:31,940
was just the most recent sat in the US
right

762
00:44:31,940 --> 00:44:35,150
but if you eat if you look at those
around the world you know I don't have

763
00:44:35,150 --> 00:44:37,720
strictly have the US focus rain

764
00:44:37,720 --> 00:44:41,270
other countries also respond to protest
by Lainie

765
00:44:41,270 --> 00:44:47,009
so my question is: a check i was just
wondering out due up any other examples

766
00:44:47,010 --> 00:44:51,740
come to mind on like most recent most
significant examples are back

767
00:44:51,740 --> 00:44:54,930
come to mind that occurred in this
country

768
00:44:54,930 --> 00:44:59,450
to any come to mind to you well that's
why I'm asking you

769
00:44:59,450 --> 00:45:02,570
yeah I think in the last year we see men

770
00:45:02,570 --> 00:45:07,010
we've seen the revolutions in Tunisia
Egypt and Libya and we've seen the

771
00:45:07,010 --> 00:45:08,500
Occupy Wall Street movement

772
00:45:08,500 --> 00:45:11,580
as the majors at Sal

773
00:45:11,580 --> 00:45:16,029
political change right I as the as major
change a chance

774
00:45:16,030 --> 00:45:19,520
arm I think we've seen a lot of violence
and all of those

775
00:45:19,520 --> 00:45:24,100
I in a share we've also seen some some
localized political blow-ups

776
00:45:24,100 --> 00:45:27,190
are particularly in China arm

777
00:45:27,190 --> 00:45:31,950
you know I don't get into too many
details in China given that I live there

778
00:45:31,950 --> 00:45:36,740
so up but i wanna say they did it
generally is the norm that give

779
00:45:36,740 --> 00:45:42,440
the population is is restive the
government doesn't respond peacefully

780
00:45:42,440 --> 00:45:46,680
arm I would like to see I I would like
to believe that it's true but I think

781
00:45:46,680 --> 00:45:50,629
we'd actually just had a real paradigm
shift in the way the police respond to

782
00:45:50,630 --> 00:45:51,570
protest

783
00:45:51,570 --> 00:45:54,730
arm and it's actually maybe it's

784
00:45:54,730 --> 00:45:58,260
maybe it hasn't been one I in the
nineteen fifties during the civil rights

785
00:45:58,260 --> 00:46:02,440
movement there was a lot of violence too
so maybe we'll just have to see that

786
00:46:02,440 --> 00:46:07,100
I'm not seen protesters being violent
I'm seeing the police being byline

787
00:46:07,100 --> 00:46:10,740
okay yes I was more concerned with our
country

788
00:46:10,740 --> 00:46:13,840
and the responsible government in our
country to you

789
00:46:13,840 --> 00:46:16,960
peaceful protests and I know you
mentioned Occupy Wall Street

790
00:46:16,960 --> 00:46:20,300
and I'm just curious in your opinion it
any others

791
00:46:20,300 --> 00:46:24,120
just in this country kinda jump out to
you most recently beside

792
00:46:24,120 --> 00:46:27,490
I haven't been living here so what comes
out to me is work cuz

793
00:46:27,490 --> 00:46:33,730
gets covered in the media yes yes
Seattle 89 wtoo I love their them

794
00:46:33,730 --> 00:46:36,840
that's a good example errors like

795
00:46:36,840 --> 00:46:42,720
generally all bed

796
00:46:42,720 --> 00:46:47,620
it and so somebody in the audience
pointed out the political conventions

797
00:46:47,620 --> 00:46:51,529
are other places where there's often a
lot of protest and and some violence

798
00:46:51,530 --> 00:46:56,730
arm I think the focus on my targets and
Remi

799
00:46:56,730 --> 00:47:00,760
specific examples of where the police
get violent I think that we

800
00:47:00,760 --> 00:47:04,440
have plenty of examples already that
protests can turn violent

801
00:47:04,440 --> 00:47:09,230
and my concern really is is that that is
happening

802
00:47:09,230 --> 00:47:13,380
thank you Chur am

803
00:47:13,380 --> 00:47:18,130
it was mentioned that government can
turn off the internet and government can

804
00:47:18,130 --> 00:47:20,670
turn off telephone service

805
00:47:20,670 --> 00:47:24,110
assuming that the government did turn
off the internet

806
00:47:24,110 --> 00:47:27,930
and before the turn of telephone what is
a feasibility able

807
00:47:27,930 --> 00:47:32,049
fashion BBS is used to convey
information

808
00:47:32,050 --> 00:47:36,210
completely feasible

809
00:47:36,210 --> 00:47:40,220
its also completely feasible they could
be monitored keep in mind that it's not

810
00:47:40,220 --> 00:47:41,240
technically

811
00:47:41,240 --> 00:47:46,300
challenging to do that yes however the
the BBS services will not be

812
00:47:46,300 --> 00:47:50,400
a disconnected until phone service was
disconnected yes sure so

813
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:52,990
so one thing that's really important to
point out you know when we talk about

814
00:47:52,990 --> 00:47:55,520
PBS as I used to run a BBS

815
00:47:55,520 --> 00:47:59,860
back in the early 90's arm PBS's on
anonymous

816
00:47:59,860 --> 00:48:03,580
you know there's there's a poll on the
physically go someplace

817
00:48:03,580 --> 00:48:07,279
that's running a PBS right so arm

818
00:48:07,280 --> 00:48:11,510
if you're trying to use a BBS to
organize protests and you also want to

819
00:48:11,510 --> 00:48:15,760
protect the personal safety and whoever
owns that proline that's a pretty tough

820
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:19,160
thing to do I it's also incredibly easy
to monitor

821
00:48:19,160 --> 00:48:22,700
you know dial-up PBS's modems are not
complicated to login

822
00:48:22,700 --> 00:48:28,060
and monitor in real time I disagree with
your assessment a veces el Indiana's

823
00:48:28,060 --> 00:48:28,630
week

824
00:48:28,630 --> 00:48:32,070
there at least as strong as providers
are in equipment vendors so I wonder

825
00:48:32,070 --> 00:48:33,270
what do you think the

826
00:48:33,270 --> 00:48:36,360
them best practices are for equipment
vendors

827
00:48:36,360 --> 00:48:38,850
service operators everything else
they're operating in various legal

828
00:48:38,850 --> 00:48:39,620
regimes

829
00:48:39,620 --> 00:48:43,640
to do this today fully comply with large
they be actively trying to change laws

830
00:48:43,640 --> 00:48:44,430
but what

831
00:48:44,430 --> 00:48:49,419
exactly Julia there's always a conflict
between the term lawful interception

832
00:48:49,420 --> 00:48:54,520
and actual real security I think that if
you look across the landscape

833
00:48:54,520 --> 00:48:58,170
I love you know large multinational
corporations

834
00:48:58,170 --> 00:49:03,030
on they will always side with whitewater
sapped and the reason for that is that

835
00:49:03,030 --> 00:49:05,080
if you don't side with level intercept

836
00:49:05,080 --> 00:49:08,500
are no matter where you're selling a
product then

837
00:49:08,500 --> 00:49:12,580
you're not able to sell a product a
naturist action so

838
00:49:12,580 --> 00:49:15,759
arm and when you look at lawful
intercept is

839
00:49:15,760 --> 00:49:19,400
arm you know particularly if you look at
a country like Russia

840
00:49:19,400 --> 00:49:23,040
heard they have a very broad definition
of a waffle intercept right

841
00:49:23,040 --> 00:49:29,050
so this is why I think it's never safe
to assume that whatever shiny crypto the

842
00:49:29,050 --> 00:49:29,680
you have

843
00:49:29,680 --> 00:49:33,440
is actually safe to use maybe it is arm
but if you assume that

844
00:49:33,440 --> 00:49:37,560
and it could get you killed or arrested
that's probably not a smart assumption

845
00:49:37,560 --> 00:49:40,750
to people should take into account the
vendors they're buying from 1a by

846
00:49:40,750 --> 00:49:42,530
security related infrastructure

847
00:49:42,530 --> 00:49:45,960
sure well people should take into
account if they're using open source

848
00:49:45,960 --> 00:49:48,680
what bugs might be there

849
00:49:48,680 --> 00:49:52,029
as your criticism in SSL apply to ssh

850
00:49:52,030 --> 00:49:56,330
and GPG awesome men in the middle
attacks can apply to any critter

851
00:49:56,330 --> 00:50:00,569
cryptographic solution that's a public
key okay thank you

852
00:50:00,570 --> 00:50:04,580
one time had it is the only reliable
crypto

853
00:50:04,580 --> 00:50:09,960
I'm just glad close with them are no
question

854
00:50:09,960 --> 00:50:13,770
giving up journey to share maybe some
use maybe we can all agree with but

855
00:50:13,770 --> 00:50:18,750
and I reno Palin jitters compete good
option II already know the parent years

856
00:50:18,750 --> 00:50:22,010
is a creepy having been in their office
but dunno I think the green yeah right

857
00:50:22,010 --> 00:50:22,690
you know they

858
00:50:22,690 --> 00:50:25,690
the people who work there and let him
john was a kid you don't share if you

859
00:50:25,690 --> 00:50:28,220
share some stories some vignettes

860
00:50:28,220 --> 00:50:32,360
with as for to well okay so when we look
ahead

861
00:50:32,360 --> 00:50:36,380
but current year dies it's actually you
know just one step up from what axioms

862
00:50:36,380 --> 00:50:37,850
doing right and so

863
00:50:37,850 --> 00:50:42,310
the technology itself army isn't so
creepy it's actually what you can do

864
00:50:42,310 --> 00:50:44,299
with the technology in who's doing it

865
00:50:44,300 --> 00:50:49,510
so are generally speaking the idea of
data visualization is gathering data

866
00:50:49,510 --> 00:50:50,280
from our

867
00:50:50,280 --> 00:50:53,760
you know a number to spare data sources
on a particular target

868
00:50:53,760 --> 00:50:57,220
I and trying to figure out what
relationships they have on

869
00:50:57,220 --> 00:51:01,590
to you know some investigative and right
so maybe what you want to do

870
00:51:01,590 --> 00:51:04,680
if you are accion is you want to figure
out how to stop

871
00:51:04,680 --> 00:51:09,140
all things are maybe if by your customer
power and he ran

872
00:51:09,140 --> 00:51:13,040
in the intelligence community arm you
want to find out whether somebody's a

873
00:51:13,040 --> 00:51:13,779
spy

874
00:51:13,780 --> 00:51:17,290
arm or maybe I if you have access to
this

875
00:51:17,290 --> 00:51:21,529
incredibly powerful technology and you
are an oppressive regime

876
00:51:21,530 --> 00:51:25,220
and you know some tibet ten-part
dictatorship someplace

877
00:51:25,220 --> 00:51:28,630
I you want to figure out who your
political opponents are and actually

878
00:51:28,630 --> 00:51:30,830
kill them in this is real stuff right

879
00:51:30,830 --> 00:51:33,960
you know I live in a corner of the world
like

880
00:51:33,960 --> 00:51:38,040
you know near Southeast Asia were a lot
a really bad stuff happens in a water

881
00:51:38,040 --> 00:51:41,520
freely unfriendly regimes like you know
I'm not far from north korea I've been

882
00:51:41,520 --> 00:51:42,150
there

883
00:51:42,150 --> 00:51:46,650
I'm not far from Myanmar like these are
now places were political opposition is

884
00:51:46,650 --> 00:51:47,890
tolerated rate

885
00:51:47,890 --> 00:51:50,890
so when the when we make these tools

886
00:51:50,890 --> 00:51:54,270
in the technology community and they
fall into the hands of governments like

887
00:51:54,270 --> 00:51:55,180
these

888
00:51:55,180 --> 00:51:59,030
real people can get killed and this is
this actually really worries

889
00:51:59,030 --> 00:52:02,260
right I am but also worries me is

890
00:52:02,260 --> 00:52:06,730
what here our government is you know at
some point becomes less benevolent than

891
00:52:06,730 --> 00:52:07,610
it is now

892
00:52:07,610 --> 00:52:11,290
out what if at some point you know
Western governments

893
00:52:11,290 --> 00:52:14,850
are start to look more like something
like north korea we could guess that it

894
00:52:14,850 --> 00:52:15,990
would never happen

895
00:52:15,990 --> 00:52:21,000
but also people are the primary public
but then it could never happen

896
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:26,850
thank you very much for your time specs
are way
