1
00:00:00,810 --> 00:00:03,060
on this is the Nemours

2
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:10,060
I'm a present to you Eva galperin either

3
00:00:12,519 --> 00:00:15,519
my name is Eva galperin I am the

4
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:19,590
international freedom of expression
coordinator at the Electronic Frontier

5
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:21,000
Foundation

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,199
how many have you here know what your
happens

7
00:00:24,199 --> 00:00:27,470
100 even

8
00:00:27,470 --> 00:00:30,679
so I don't have to exclaim a

9
00:00:30,679 --> 00:00:35,390
I i spent a lot of my time trying to
keep good journalists and activists and

10
00:00:35,390 --> 00:00:36,170
dissidents

11
00:00:36,170 --> 00:00:39,190
a all over the world from getting killed

12
00:00:39,190 --> 00:00:42,910
because ur things that they say online
and

13
00:00:42,910 --> 00:00:46,200
one of the most important tools that we
have in our toolbox

14
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:49,559
is a anonymity and pseudonym buddies

15
00:00:49,559 --> 00:00:53,890
so I'm I'm here to give talk today about
to give the

16
00:00:53,890 --> 00:00:57,829
development love the pseudonym at:
online

17
00:00:57,829 --> 00:01:02,410
over the last couple years a what has
happened to anywhere I think it is going

18
00:01:02,410 --> 00:01:07,900
you you can follow me on twitter if you
have a sudden urge to do so

19
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:12,040
I'm either side so

20
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:15,900
we're gonna start with the super super
easy stuff gonna get that out of the way

21
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:20,250
my plans are not showing this is a sad
story

22
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:23,619
ok

23
00:01:23,619 --> 00:01:29,140
this is a very sad story and even

24
00:01:29,140 --> 00:01:34,079
happened member knowing

25
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:38,920
I'm assuming it's either the FBI or the
CIA

26
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:45,920
or any 10 a.m.

27
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:53,140
I guess please

28
00:01:54,890 --> 00:01:57,980
again a problem but there was a there
was a guy here

29
00:01:57,980 --> 00:02:01,210
job at worst massacre

30
00:02:01,210 --> 00:02:06,010
aren't furger gonna talk really quickly
about

31
00:02:06,010 --> 00:02:08,929
that I got lead wasn't very helpful was
it

32
00:02:08,929 --> 00:02:13,230
the sack keep talking I'm

33
00:02:13,230 --> 00:02:16,880
thurgood but not really quickly about a

34
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:20,120
about sanity am and exciting ways in
which

35
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:23,840
it differs from from anonymity and

36
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:27,250
pseudonym is weird

37
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:33,940
not too bad a theme is a fictitious name
used one another to conceal his or her

38
00:02:33,940 --> 00:02:35,840
identity or pen name

39
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:40,030
it different from anonymity which is the
state of being

40
00:02:40,030 --> 00:02:43,130
unnamed or unidentified wanna

41
00:02:43,130 --> 00:02:47,430
the the most important differences
between sit in a million anonymity is

42
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:48,890
that you create sort of this

43
00:02:48,890 --> 00:02:52,920
you create a personality online you
create somebody with a track record with

44
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:54,450
a certain level accountability

45
00:02:54,450 --> 00:02:57,470
even if it doesn't necessarily have your
name attached to it

46
00:02:57,470 --> 00:03:00,930
and that is feature a pseudonym it is
not present to them

47
00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:07,050
soon nobody is really important in the
history of the United States

48
00:03:07,050 --> 00:03:10,090
Alexander Hamilton John j&

49
00:03:10,090 --> 00:03:14,280
James Madison got together two forms
that have a super group that to the

50
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:17,670
federalist papers and they all did it
under pseudonyms

51
00:03:17,670 --> 00:03:21,660
this guy

52
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:25,090
this chick

53
00:03:25,090 --> 00:03:29,160
mandatory Lady Gaga content

54
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:33,670
so a once upon a time

55
00:03:33,670 --> 00:03:36,790
when when you got out onto the a great
big internet

56
00:03:36,790 --> 00:03:40,109
I you would find yourself in

57
00:03:40,110 --> 00:03:43,280
a chat room or and online forum

58
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:46,700
or a newsgroup and you would have to
make some sort of decision about what

59
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:48,440
you were going to call yourself

60
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:52,670
now most people did not use their full
names are given their first names

61
00:03:52,670 --> 00:03:56,060
largely to prevent name collisions I

62
00:03:56,060 --> 00:03:59,780
which led to this a.m. culture a
pseudonym at:

63
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:02,840
some notable pseudonyms her a

64
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:05,880
scud mare mare not be here netcom

65
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:09,410
I know is here Muthu founded the 4chan

66
00:04:09,410 --> 00:04:13,120
for some some guy named Emmanuel
Goldstein

67
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:16,380
Barnaby Jack generally people were
interested in

68
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:19,488
and in computer security tend to be

69
00:04:19,489 --> 00:04:23,300
very interested in exploring the
internet using pseudonyms because they

70
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:24,130
are

71
00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:28,250
concerned about not necessarily having
their their name

72
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:31,610
attached to their work which may in some
ways be controversial

73
00:04:31,610 --> 00:04:35,380
now not all pseudonyms

74
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:38,540
word a were appropriate for every forum

75
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:41,800
the surname that you use on you know
under local

76
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:47,090
MMO is not necessarily the same name
that you're going to be using for

77
00:04:47,090 --> 00:04:51,280
gala I don't know love forearm

78
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:55,570
about exchanging recipes it would just
be kinda weird and everybody understood

79
00:04:55,570 --> 00:04:56,150
this

80
00:04:56,150 --> 00:05:01,430
on until its other

81
00:05:01,430 --> 00:05:04,410
the Internet ima to play with your
identity there's a very famous cartoon

82
00:05:04,410 --> 00:05:05,190
on the Internet

83
00:05:05,190 --> 00:05:10,580
nobody knows you're a dog the problem

84
00:05:10,580 --> 00:05:14,599
with on the internet no one knowing that
your dog is that sometimes this whole

85
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:15,430
play with the

86
00:05:15,430 --> 00:05:19,830
with your identity can go wrong about a
year ago today

87
00:05:19,830 --> 00:05:23,590
%uh there there was a scandal involving
I mean RR

88
00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:27,350
who on blog for six years

89
00:05:27,350 --> 00:05:31,660
and a she maintained a blog called a gay
girl in Damascus

90
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:37,430
on so as buyers pseudonyms go this was a
a pseudonym with a great deal a

91
00:05:37,430 --> 00:05:38,400
credibility

92
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:42,150
she was writing about an assertive

93
00:05:42,150 --> 00:05:45,470
gay culture in in Syria which was

94
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:48,770
controversial and and she wrote in a
really

95
00:05:48,770 --> 00:05:53,669
stirring and interesting way furthermore
not only did she write in her own blog

96
00:05:53,669 --> 00:05:54,549
but she

97
00:05:54,550 --> 00:05:58,000
a would comment on other people's blogs
and she created sort of this

98
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,720
on she was part in this whole community
love

99
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:05,680
queer bloggers online especially crib
loggers in

100
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:09,190
in the Middle East %uh what is
particularly interesting

101
00:06:09,190 --> 00:06:13,020
about Mina is the in all the six years
thats

102
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:17,560
that she blogs very a very passionately

103
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:20,630
about her life in Damascus no one

104
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:24,879
actually ever met her and this

105
00:06:24,879 --> 00:06:27,939
didn't really set of any a

106
00:06:27,939 --> 00:06:31,000
on any concern a ring any bells

107
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:35,520
I until a gay girl in Damascus was
apparently

108
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:41,020
kidnapped as a result of this we
discovered this

109
00:06:41,020 --> 00:06:45,400
to Damascus his name is Tom MacMaster

110
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:52,400
says parties he is not gay he is not a
girl who's not Syrian

111
00:06:52,610 --> 00:06:56,009
interestingly enough I when many

112
00:06:56,009 --> 00:07:00,610
when other members love a Muniz
community came out and talked about

113
00:07:00,610 --> 00:07:04,110
how hurt and betrayed they felt

114
00:07:04,110 --> 00:07:07,669
third this woman who was telling this
important story

115
00:07:07,669 --> 00:07:10,688
who had been quoted in newspapers

116
00:07:10,689 --> 00:07:14,719
who a there were reporters who claimed
that they had actually had physical

117
00:07:14,719 --> 00:07:17,620
meetings with her and it turned out that
the meetings that did not actually taken

118
00:07:17,620 --> 00:07:18,620
place

119
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:23,509
on when these people expressed their
sorta outrage

120
00:07:23,509 --> 00:07:27,219
that's a that Tom MacMaster had decided
to

121
00:07:27,219 --> 00:07:30,669
masquerade as a a gay twenty-something

122
00:07:30,669 --> 00:07:35,560
living and Syria this is what he had
said

123
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:39,539
well the narrative voice may have been
fictional the facts on this blog

124
00:07:39,539 --> 00:07:43,009
are true and not misleading as to the
situation on the ground

125
00:07:43,009 --> 00:07:47,060
I do not believe I have harmed anyone I
feel I have created an important voice

126
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:50,159
for issues that I feel strongly about

127
00:07:50,159 --> 00:07:53,900
missus apology

128
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:57,979
now obviously either there are some
problems with this and I i think any

129
00:07:57,979 --> 00:07:58,979
carbon

130
00:07:58,979 --> 00:08:02,039
give one of the most as alien criticisms

131
00:08:02,039 --> 00:08:06,509
which was the when a when voices like
Amenas

132
00:08:06,509 --> 00:08:10,759
are so publicly discredited it creates a
cry wolf affect

133
00:08:10,759 --> 00:08:15,689
and it makes it very difficult to take a
other voices at face value

134
00:08:15,689 --> 00:08:19,110
especially the voices ok we're
bloggers.com God Damascus

135
00:08:19,110 --> 00:08:23,879
on and so in that way you could argue
that he did in fact

136
00:08:23,879 --> 00:08:27,110
do some harm and this is one of the
things that people are really concerned

137
00:08:27,110 --> 00:08:29,219
about when it comes

138
00:08:29,219 --> 00:08:32,890
when it comes to Sudanese I one hand
people can play with their identities

139
00:08:32,890 --> 00:08:37,699
but on the other hand day you can
pretend to be people that they're not

140
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:41,750
so somehow having a real name maury what
Google

141
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:44,820
later first lady name shaped name

142
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:48,840
on creates greater trust

143
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:53,260
and that when people exchange real
looking names

144
00:08:53,260 --> 00:08:58,000
other the the will take each other more
seriously and are more likely to be

145
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,510
authentic

146
00:09:01,510 --> 00:09:04,689
now I'm this argument really interesting
because

147
00:09:04,690 --> 00:09:09,270
well comic master did not use his real
name he was using a pseudonym

148
00:09:09,270 --> 00:09:12,569
it was a name she play in this would
have passed any

149
00:09:12,570 --> 00:09:16,640
a any standard for for Facebook or
Google+ or any

150
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:20,910
any social network that has a real names
policy

151
00:09:20,910 --> 00:09:23,959
on the other thing that does social
networks

152
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:27,990
are are very very worried about on

153
00:09:27,990 --> 00:09:31,500
social networks such as Friendster
Facebook LinkedIn

154
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:35,680
up blizzard basically very briefly
considered requiring people to use their

155
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:36,670
real names

156
00:09:36,670 --> 00:09:40,270
on are on their support for months so
the

157
00:09:40,270 --> 00:09:44,660
I anybody who ever Google's you will
know about be ok some kind of problem

158
00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:48,290
that you had with your lake level 70
troll midge

159
00:09:48,290 --> 00:09:51,959
on and the comment sections have some
newspapers also

160
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:55,890
adopted as a dove a requirement that you
use Facebook logins are a requirement

161
00:09:55,890 --> 00:09:58,060
that you use your real name

162
00:09:58,060 --> 00:10:01,270
on and the reason that they did this

163
00:10:01,270 --> 00:10:06,170
what strolls

164
00:10:06,170 --> 00:10:09,640
people run social networks are very
worried about roles

165
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:13,360
mort wrongs these kinda trolls

166
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:18,650
and the reason why is a.m. was referred
to as

167
00:10:18,650 --> 00:10:24,370
the greater internet fuckwad theory this
theory posits that a normal person

168
00:10:24,370 --> 00:10:28,940
armed with anonymity and an audience
online

169
00:10:28,940 --> 00:10:32,950
will be hit up like a total douchebag

170
00:10:32,950 --> 00:10:36,130
and border I would say

171
00:10:36,130 --> 00:10:40,170
the last couple of years this is a has a
theory that has gained

172
00:10:40,170 --> 00:10:43,400
many adherents including Facebook

173
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:47,450
Facebook did until recently have an
extremely strict

174
00:10:47,450 --> 00:10:50,630
real names policy that required you to
use your real name

175
00:10:50,630 --> 00:10:55,750
or your account will be suspended

176
00:10:55,750 --> 00:11:01,380
why do they really do this well I bet
you can guess

177
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:05,040
big fat piles of cash it turns out that

178
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:08,280
if other if the social networker company
can take

179
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:13,270
all the information that they have about
you your a juror web browsing habits

180
00:11:13,270 --> 00:11:17,220
a the brands that you like the people
that you talked to the place where

181
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:18,030
you're located

182
00:11:18,030 --> 00:11:21,589
places where you go and they can combine
that with your real name and say

183
00:11:21,590 --> 00:11:26,770
your credit report that your identity is
worth an enormous amount of money to

184
00:11:26,770 --> 00:11:28,069
advertisers

185
00:11:28,070 --> 00:11:32,200
and the more authentic your profile
looks to advertisers

186
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:39,200
the more money the company can sell it
for

187
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:43,300
now we run into some problems

188
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:46,360
this is well gonna I he was

189
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:49,790
a Facebook user a couple years ago who
ran

190
00:11:49,790 --> 00:11:53,930
a on around a very important Facebook

191
00:11:53,930 --> 00:11:58,140
group called we are all highly say

192
00:11:58,140 --> 00:12:02,060
and he did it under a pseudonym he was

193
00:12:02,060 --> 00:12:06,630
working at Google at the time he was
engaged in activism he felt but

194
00:12:06,630 --> 00:12:09,910
having his name attached this activism
would be a

195
00:12:09,910 --> 00:12:13,110
possibly until the Terriers to his
health

196
00:12:13,110 --> 00:12:16,190
and therefore did not use his real name

197
00:12:16,190 --> 00:12:20,910
%uh obviously once the a whole inside
site started to

198
00:12:20,910 --> 00:12:24,060
started to become very popular and
gained some enemies

199
00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:27,560
im say I don't know he chipped on his

200
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:32,710
account was reported as being in
violation of the real names policy

201
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:36,120
because the Calgary love was in
violation of the real names policy it

202
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:37,190
was suspended

203
00:12:37,190 --> 00:12:41,500
and there was no more administrator
forward that we are all hide said

204
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:44,860
group now

205
00:12:44,860 --> 00:12:48,960
the way that this problem was resolved
was essentially in a backdoor deal where

206
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:51,480
somebody talk to somebody at Facebook
and they said

207
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:55,030
well gee if you can find somebody to
vouch for this guy will go ahead we'll

208
00:12:55,030 --> 00:12:57,300
let him run this very important group

209
00:12:57,300 --> 00:13:00,860
but if you're not some important guy a
Google

210
00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:04,550
if you're just some you know
fifteen-year-old blogging in your

211
00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:05,670
parents basement

212
00:13:05,670 --> 00:13:08,770
which is I understand what where most
bloggers

213
00:13:08,770 --> 00:13:11,860
blog from I'm

214
00:13:11,860 --> 00:13:15,470
if you don't have contact Facebook
contact sync Google

215
00:13:15,470 --> 00:13:18,520
to Balch for you then

216
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:21,569
when somebody reports your pseudonym

217
00:13:21,570 --> 00:13:25,540
as in violation of the real names policy
there's absolutely nobody there to help

218
00:13:25,540 --> 00:13:26,219
you

219
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:29,880
not by these policies are very serious
problem

220
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:34,370
so everybody is very upset about
Facebook's real names policy

221
00:13:34,370 --> 00:13:37,420
and a

222
00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:41,150
Google+ decided that they were going to
enter the social networking space

223
00:13:41,150 --> 00:13:44,260
people were very excited because they
need an alternative to Facebook they

224
00:13:44,260 --> 00:13:47,500
were thinking perhaps it will have
better privacy protections Facebook was

225
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:48,140
in the habit

226
00:13:48,140 --> 00:13:52,569
love a launching upgrades and updates
that would suddenly take

227
00:13:52,570 --> 00:13:57,560
information that had previously been
private and making it public by default

228
00:13:57,560 --> 00:14:00,810
that's the sort of thing that you know
people don't necessarily want

229
00:14:00,810 --> 00:14:04,430
I in their social network a the thought
that perhaps

230
00:14:04,430 --> 00:14:07,740
circles might make it easier for them to
manage the

231
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:11,210
their relationships with other people so
that they could post

232
00:14:11,210 --> 00:14:16,200
a their wild bruising snapshots only to
their friends

233
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:20,100
and not say to their grandmother on

234
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:23,380
and furthermore Google had a

235
00:14:23,380 --> 00:14:26,890
you know sterling reputation for not
being evil

236
00:14:26,890 --> 00:14:30,600
please try not to smoke

237
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:35,350
what we have here is a Facebook post
were very enthusiastic a doctor

238
00:14:35,350 --> 00:14:40,110
%uh Google+ he announced that with the
advent of Google Plus I will soon be

239
00:14:40,110 --> 00:14:42,570
deleting my facebook account in protest

240
00:14:42,570 --> 00:14:46,680
the ever worsening privacy policy is and
many other reprehensible terms and

241
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:47,660
conditions changes

242
00:14:47,660 --> 00:14:51,730
I encourage you all to join me we were
all gonna go over to this other social

243
00:14:51,730 --> 00:14:55,700
networks like 10 minutes

244
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:59,240
unfortunately Google+ decided that they
too would have a real names policy and

245
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:02,390
not only were they going to have a real
names policy but it was going to be

246
00:15:02,390 --> 00:15:06,020
even more restrictive than weird than
Facebook's

247
00:15:06,020 --> 00:15:09,770
a based Google+ is real names policy on

248
00:15:09,770 --> 00:15:13,199
was automated it would be they actually
had

249
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:16,940
a a spider that crawled account names

250
00:15:16,940 --> 00:15:20,160
and flag suspicious things and simply

251
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:24,339
suspend suspend them without any kind

252
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:27,810
warning or due process and they

253
00:15:27,810 --> 00:15:31,280
wound up a suspending accounts a

254
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:36,350
that had handles a modern MZ size in the
audience

255
00:15:36,350 --> 00:15:39,400
are our personal representatives from on
Em's

256
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:44,850
people with stage names people whose
names contained non-standard characters

257
00:15:44,850 --> 00:15:48,210
a non-western names it's actually really
common for

258
00:15:48,210 --> 00:15:51,540
for people in hong kong to adopters
sorta

259
00:15:51,540 --> 00:15:54,670
secondary Western sounding name that has
not made entirely

260
00:15:54,670 --> 00:15:58,110
Chinese characters because it's just
easier to type on a

261
00:15:58,110 --> 00:16:01,540
US keyboard on and

262
00:16:01,540 --> 00:16:08,170
amusingly enough they also a they also
suspended a bunch of Google employees

263
00:16:08,170 --> 00:16:12,340
it's not like they didn't know who they
were

264
00:16:12,340 --> 00:16:16,160
so activists were outraged a blog like
crazy 0

265
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:19,250
of adds we had we had a hash tag

266
00:16:19,250 --> 00:16:23,000
other memoirs and plus Kate I we
launched a

267
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:26,510
a site called my name is mean which iPad
a bunch

268
00:16:26,510 --> 00:16:30,230
love sorta personal testimonials from
people talking about how important their

269
00:16:30,230 --> 00:16:31,880
pseudonyms were to them

270
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:35,650
on this included violet blue

271
00:16:35,650 --> 00:16:39,340
and Cory Doctorow does not actually rate
Anderson

272
00:16:39,340 --> 00:16:42,850
but still talked about how important was
on there was a

273
00:16:42,850 --> 00:16:47,080
fantastic wiki written up by the I geek
feminism

274
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:50,220
folks called who is hurt by real name
policies

275
00:16:50,220 --> 00:16:53,280
they pointed out that you know a women

276
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:57,510
minorities people with unpopular
opinions people who

277
00:16:57,510 --> 00:17:00,819
a are im guy in jobs

278
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:04,350
that's need to so to keep their private
lives private

279
00:17:04,349 --> 00:17:07,609
like teachers doctors on

280
00:17:07,610 --> 00:17:11,150
all benefit from from the use of
pseudonyms online

281
00:17:11,150 --> 00:17:15,089
a we had a indices love the blog posts
and the coverage that it was actually

282
00:17:15,089 --> 00:17:17,139
very easy for journalists to find

283
00:17:17,140 --> 00:17:21,620
and to create more coverage I we'd tried
to encourage people to do some research

284
00:17:21,620 --> 00:17:25,339
because it turns out that the greater in
that internet the quad gary has not

285
00:17:25,339 --> 00:17:29,020
actually been tested by academics in any
way

286
00:17:29,020 --> 00:17:33,260
and Dana Boyd is busy ok

287
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:36,299
and we had meetings with Google
executives in which we basically through

288
00:17:36,299 --> 00:17:41,030
our hands up and said seriously what you
doing

289
00:17:41,030 --> 00:17:45,580
and lower it was good

290
00:17:45,580 --> 00:17:50,370
on many months later Google+ a change
there

291
00:17:50,370 --> 00:17:54,140
real names policy and a decided they
would

292
00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:57,200
allowed people to have pseudonyms on

293
00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:02,180
as long as they could point to someplace
where they had been using that pseudonym

294
00:18:02,180 --> 00:18:02,940
for

295
00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:06,530
aid sufficiently the time or it had

296
00:18:06,530 --> 00:18:09,810
a a sufficient following this amounts to

297
00:18:09,810 --> 00:18:16,810
pseudonyms for famous people kinda
winner

298
00:18:17,140 --> 00:18:21,870
where is your payments and

299
00:18:21,870 --> 00:18:26,050
here's what the the chief architect
Google+ had to say about this earth and

300
00:18:26,050 --> 00:18:26,860
change apart

301
00:18:26,860 --> 00:18:30,660
said we've got people would behave very
differently when they were and when they

302
00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:32,300
weren't going by their real names

303
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:35,350
after watching the system for a while we
realized that this was not in fact the

304
00:18:35,350 --> 00:18:35,850
case

305
00:18:35,850 --> 00:18:40,750
and in particular bastards are still
bastards under their own names

306
00:18:40,750 --> 00:18:44,690
a quote that I would like stitched on a
sampler somewhere

307
00:18:44,690 --> 00:18:49,730
now again %uh there's still some
problems with the Google+ Williams

308
00:18:49,730 --> 00:18:50,330
policy

309
00:18:50,330 --> 00:18:53,929
a Thursday they have a preference for
name shapes names

310
00:18:53,930 --> 00:18:58,010
%uh so for example side is still out of
luck with his Monem

311
00:18:58,010 --> 00:19:02,230
on and is still under review

312
00:19:02,230 --> 00:19:05,510
there's no indication what the press
Holden's

313
00:19:05,510 --> 00:19:09,510
a for an existing handle with a
sufficient following up but as far as I

314
00:19:09,510 --> 00:19:11,080
can tell it's basically

315
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:14,280
if you're famous will let it slide on

316
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:18,080
and users his previous attempts at using
names

317
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:22,040
a have been River a have been rejected
don't know that they have the

318
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:24,220
opportunity to try again

319
00:19:24,220 --> 00:19:27,780
so people simply wandered off from
Google+ because it wasn't terribly

320
00:19:27,780 --> 00:19:28,320
helpful

321
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:31,590
now I can't see you

322
00:19:31,590 --> 00:19:35,340
but that's good external noise

323
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:39,070
make some noise if you actually still
use Google+

324
00:19:39,070 --> 00:19:45,889
I'm going to guess that this is not the
entire room

325
00:19:45,890 --> 00:19:50,350
Google+ is changeable

326
00:19:50,350 --> 00:19:53,950
searching apart is a is really just the
beginning

327
00:19:53,950 --> 00:19:57,690
I love love those sorta backlash against
real names policies

328
00:19:57,690 --> 00:20:00,940
I and and four and in defensive
pseudonyms

329
00:20:00,940 --> 00:20:04,390
I in February love 2012 a

330
00:20:04,390 --> 00:20:08,030
Facebook launched a very similar policy
whereas they have had this very strict

331
00:20:08,030 --> 00:20:09,550
real names policy in the past

332
00:20:09,550 --> 00:20:12,919
I they now have a real names policy that
amounts to

333
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:16,040
if you're famous will let it slide on

334
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:19,830
this is wonderful for famous people I if
your say

335
00:20:19,830 --> 00:20:24,350
salman rushdie and your account has been
suspended on Facebook which is something

336
00:20:24,350 --> 00:20:25,440
that has happened

337
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:28,960
I is you are Michael anti and you

338
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:32,820
are you know a Chinese blogger who has
published under the pseudonym for many

339
00:20:32,820 --> 00:20:33,340
years

340
00:20:33,340 --> 00:20:36,439
including in the new york times and
you've had your caps suspended

341
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:40,360
this is very usefull but again if you
are a 15-year-old blogging in the

342
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:40,950
basement

343
00:20:40,950 --> 00:20:45,380
almost blocking happens I'm you are
still at a block

344
00:20:45,380 --> 00:20:49,050
on especially and and this is especially
important if your say

345
00:20:49,050 --> 00:20:53,129
in a Syrian basement at this time or
basement in any authoritarian regime

346
00:20:53,130 --> 00:20:56,720
so this is not the end because there are

347
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:59,830
other a there are other companies the

348
00:20:59,830 --> 00:21:03,689
have found this I'll have found

349
00:21:03,690 --> 00:21:06,900
unleashed they understand that the

350
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:10,720
internet needs to nobody and they need
to create tools that allow people to

351
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:11,850
express themselves

352
00:21:11,850 --> 00:21:15,790
online in a way that lets them play with
their identities

353
00:21:15,790 --> 00:21:19,149
and then you get companies like tumbler
and

354
00:21:19,150 --> 00:21:23,000
Pinterest and discuss which actually did
some research

355
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:26,750
on on on anonymous and synonymous
comments

356
00:21:26,750 --> 00:21:30,700
and and found that they were very useful
the actual

357
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:34,800
a methodology is kinda questionable so
really the jury's still out

358
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:40,030
on tumbler is particularly interesting
in that they have been

359
00:21:40,030 --> 00:21:43,450
vehement in their defense are a

360
00:21:43,450 --> 00:21:47,110
a free speech and and to the right to
call yourself whatever you want

361
00:21:47,110 --> 00:21:51,730
on tumbler which I have really enjoyed
tumbler does have some

362
00:21:51,730 --> 00:21:55,990
content policy issues a but really when
it comes down to

363
00:21:55,990 --> 00:21:59,720
keeping yourself anonymous or
pseudonymous they have been very strong

364
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:02,210
proponents at this particular type a
free speech

365
00:22:02,210 --> 00:22:05,480
finally

366
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:12,290
I A I would like to say that's a you
should support the effort pressure

367
00:22:12,290 --> 00:22:13,220
wonderful

368
00:22:13,220 --> 00:22:17,680
I need money for Cape good

369
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:24,680
and I would like to open a flood
questions

370
00:22:27,779 --> 00:22:32,200
on

371
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:35,180
months

372
00:22:35,180 --> 00:22:38,900
I exxon add

373
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:42,570
do you know any examples ad networks
that are doing it

374
00:22:42,570 --> 00:22:46,340
well because I've known folks who are
like am staying at the social network in

375
00:22:46,340 --> 00:22:47,169
the ass me it's like

376
00:22:47,170 --> 00:22:50,340
hey how can I do this in a way that
isn't shitty

377
00:22:50,340 --> 00:22:55,350
might I wish I had an example to show
you you can read like a pointed them

378
00:22:55,350 --> 00:22:55,870
today

379
00:22:55,870 --> 00:23:00,160
there is the Google engineer who did the
like long posts about

380
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:04,320
what they were when they change things
and what they were all

381
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:08,689
trying to do not the only example I had
I think that the

382
00:23:08,690 --> 00:23:12,470
the promise behind social networking
sites

383
00:23:12,470 --> 00:23:16,100
is in some ways problematic the

384
00:23:16,100 --> 00:23:19,230
exchange that you're making as a user is
the

385
00:23:19,230 --> 00:23:22,440
you are going to exchange all this
information about yourself

386
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:25,580
in exchange for this three and fifty
service

387
00:23:25,580 --> 00:23:28,929
and your real name on

388
00:23:28,930 --> 00:23:33,540
on attached to that information makes it
more valuable as long as companies are

389
00:23:33,540 --> 00:23:35,620
using this as their business model

390
00:23:35,620 --> 00:23:40,190
they have absolutely no incentive to
allow you to express yourself

391
00:23:40,190 --> 00:23:44,410
anonymously or under a pseudonym and
every incentive

392
00:23:44,410 --> 00:23:47,900
to track you and find out as much
information about you as they possibly

393
00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:48,660
can

394
00:23:48,660 --> 00:23:53,130
so this this business model is highly
problematic for

395
00:23:53,130 --> 00:23:56,890
for activists and and people who are
concerned

396
00:23:56,890 --> 00:24:00,050
about their privacy on that said

397
00:24:00,050 --> 00:24:03,940
there are their companies are not social
networks that are doing

398
00:24:03,940 --> 00:24:07,080
a particularly good job with this %uh
Twitter will let you call yourself

399
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:07,960
whatever you want

400
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:11,920
on discuss will let you call yourself
whatever you want

401
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:15,040
even Google's a blogger

402
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:18,780
platform will allow you to use a
pseudonym I

403
00:24:18,780 --> 00:24:21,850
same goes for I think Posterous

404
00:24:21,850 --> 00:24:25,030
interest in Tumbler so this whole new
generation

405
00:24:25,030 --> 00:24:28,530
a sharing platforms is

406
00:24:28,530 --> 00:24:33,000
a is largely supportive a obscenity
which i think is a very good sign

407
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:38,040
%uh sir this is not much just question

408
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:41,970
but a common and loved here your
comments on it as well on

409
00:24:41,970 --> 00:24:45,120
I was born with an excruciatingly common
name

410
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:48,130
and so pseudonyms for a person like
myself

411
00:24:48,130 --> 00:24:51,490
is a way to actually be noticed and
nonce II

412
00:24:51,490 --> 00:24:55,330
not hide some the content that I want to
have found the zone

413
00:24:55,330 --> 00:24:58,820
and I just want to hear your comments on
that in the context and

414
00:24:58,820 --> 00:25:02,360
everything been speaking now well again
I think the

415
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:06,600
ok one of the things that but pseudonyms
empower us to do

416
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:10,640
rather than being sorta forever wedded
to our real names is that we become

417
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:14,180
empowered to decide how much ourselves
we want to share with the world and

418
00:25:14,180 --> 00:25:17,460
that the flexibility we simply don't
have in a world in which our real names

419
00:25:17,460 --> 00:25:19,300
are attached everything that we do
online

420
00:25:19,300 --> 00:25:23,650
way to turn away about the F word
announce a facebook

421
00:25:23,650 --> 00:25:26,960
arm I'm seeing what Microsoft

422
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:30,640
as it kinda rose to become a monopoly
here people

423
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:33,680
assume certain things that like many in
them soft words on the Microsoft

424
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:34,260
platform

425
00:25:34,260 --> 00:25:38,110
when you in a document in Word format
have seen the same kind of thing with

426
00:25:38,110 --> 00:25:39,510
Facebook loggins

427
00:25:39,510 --> 00:25:43,910
I connectivity he you know touched get
touch me on Facebook

428
00:25:43,910 --> 00:25:47,110
how one I meaner I don't think there's

429
00:25:47,110 --> 00:25:50,200
there's gonna be a critical mass point
we really can avoid that's how we treat

430
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:50,450
it

431
00:25:50,420 --> 00:25:53,530
how do we can and maybe make an end-run

432
00:25:53,530 --> 00:25:58,790
or I don't know and %uh that's actually
one of the problems that we were

433
00:25:58,790 --> 00:26:02,580
that we were hoping a service like
Google+ word address

434
00:26:02,580 --> 00:26:06,340
and one of the reasons why Google+ is
real names policy was such a profound

435
00:26:06,340 --> 00:26:07,570
disappointment

436
00:26:07,570 --> 00:26:11,200
to many of the people who a

437
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:14,450
engage in heavy use of social networks
and

438
00:26:14,450 --> 00:26:19,230
who make social network successful now
would go so far as to posit that the

439
00:26:19,230 --> 00:26:22,650
black adoption by those people's one of
the reasons why Google+

440
00:26:22,650 --> 00:26:26,310
didn't really take off in in a
facebook-like

441
00:26:26,310 --> 00:26:29,540
way Google still claims that's that

442
00:26:29,540 --> 00:26:32,680
Google+ is incredibly successful because
it has a lot to users

443
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:36,320
but the way that they a that they count
their users

444
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:40,679
is on very different from the way the
Facebook doesn't

445
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:44,760
I and as a general rule Google+ users

446
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:48,770
do not spend nearly as much time on
Google+ as they do on Facebook

447
00:26:48,770 --> 00:26:52,020
on I think the any discussion incident
only online

448
00:26:52,020 --> 00:26:55,520
absolutely has to wrestle with the
problem that Facebook

449
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:59,190
is the nine hundred-pound gorilla in the
room and

450
00:26:59,190 --> 00:27:03,690
the they don't allow a lotta a lot of
room personally online

451
00:27:03,690 --> 00:27:09,160
on there are projects like to the
Diaspora projects that are

452
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:13,010
you know working on this soda a.m. open
source

453
00:27:13,010 --> 00:27:16,700
decentralize version a

454
00:27:16,700 --> 00:27:21,080
over social network that would allow
people to on

455
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:24,520
so decide how much of their private
lives they wanna make they wanna make

456
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:25,420
public

457
00:27:25,420 --> 00:27:29,200
but I think it's a it's a long way

458
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:33,440
from from becoming a reality at this
time I would certainly encourage

459
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:37,960
people to think about sorta alternatives
that they could pursue

460
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:41,350
it sir I'm in a room full of software
developers

461
00:27:41,350 --> 00:27:46,140
surely someone here can work on

462
00:27:46,140 --> 00:27:49,570
I wonder if we have misunderstood the

463
00:27:49,570 --> 00:27:53,200
reasons why large social networks chose
not to

464
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:57,179
lasted names I mean you said okay
advertisers et cetera but

465
00:27:57,179 --> 00:28:00,330
I bet you can make an argument that the
advertisers don't care what your name is

466
00:28:00,330 --> 00:28:03,310
as long as they know you're a ginger
friends and all these sorts of things

467
00:28:03,310 --> 00:28:04,899
for targeting

468
00:28:04,900 --> 00:28:06,260
what about

469
00:28:06,260 --> 00:28:10,390
the law enforcement argument do we know
anything about

470
00:28:10,390 --> 00:28:14,910
that what about the I am the the other
part in that thread from

471
00:28:14,910 --> 00:28:19,320
gonna turn zongol mentioned that they
saw that conversion rates for that is

472
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:19,980
someone who

473
00:28:19,980 --> 00:28:24,810
came back to Google+ I for people who
were not within

474
00:28:24,810 --> 00:28:28,950
this sort of let's say technically
oriented community

475
00:28:28,950 --> 00:28:33,570
I were much lower when they ran into
people use incidents in other words

476
00:28:33,570 --> 00:28:37,280
they claim that students are scaring the
Straits and

477
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:40,780
I wonder if we don't characterize

478
00:28:40,780 --> 00:28:44,770
why they actually want to do this life
will never be able to convince them

479
00:28:44,770 --> 00:28:45,510
otherwise

480
00:28:45,510 --> 00:28:49,830
well at you're actually miss
characterizing going on a desk work

481
00:28:49,830 --> 00:28:53,290
he said specifically that

482
00:28:53,290 --> 00:28:56,870
people were turned off when they saw on
on name shaped

483
00:28:56,870 --> 00:29:00,170
pseudonyms when they saw you know

484
00:29:00,170 --> 00:29:03,510
I am medic 23 I

485
00:29:03,510 --> 00:29:07,030
instead of John Adams not to pick on
that guy over there

486
00:29:07,030 --> 00:29:10,389
and hmm

487
00:29:10,390 --> 00:29:14,660
yes yet that has no respect for privacy

488
00:29:14,660 --> 00:29:19,950
look at this so it turns out that %uh
that is what Google was

489
00:29:19,950 --> 00:29:22,910
was concerned about that's one of the
reasons why they insist on what they

490
00:29:22,910 --> 00:29:25,150
were purged with name shaped names

491
00:29:25,150 --> 00:29:28,400
on you could also argue that advertisers

492
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:31,910
aren't concerned that they had your real
name they are concerned that they have

493
00:29:31,910 --> 00:29:35,310
something vaguely name shapes that
sounds plausible

494
00:29:35,310 --> 00:29:39,000
and as non-technical people that they
are also turned off

495
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:42,150
by random strings love letters and
numbers

496
00:29:42,150 --> 00:29:46,510
that may or may not be traceable back to
an actual human being

497
00:29:46,510 --> 00:29:50,730
I think that the on the law enforcement
arguments

498
00:29:50,730 --> 00:29:54,790
is is not without merit certainly Eric
Schmidt has

499
00:29:54,790 --> 00:29:57,960
has come out in public and said that
their anonymity

500
00:29:57,960 --> 00:30:01,600
a I think this was this may have been
about two years ago

501
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:05,660
but the the quote was the enemy on on
the Internet has to go away

502
00:30:05,660 --> 00:30:10,190
because on government simply will not
allow it

503
00:30:10,190 --> 00:30:13,830
they they need to know who you are for
law enforcement purposes

504
00:30:13,830 --> 00:30:19,929
and while I think that is a reflection
of how much pressure there is

505
00:30:19,930 --> 00:30:25,250
on I on companies to provide that kind
of information the government's

506
00:30:25,250 --> 00:30:28,420
it's also the best argument I have ever
heard for fighting it

507
00:30:28,420 --> 00:30:34,320
%ah

508
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:38,750
and this is more of a general comment
and a question but dunno I think another

509
00:30:38,750 --> 00:30:39,880
angle to all this

510
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:43,720
is becoming more and more evident as we
have things like that

511
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:48,240
on the ability on new sites are blocked
a sign in with your Facebook login and

512
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:49,120
post a comment

513
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:54,130
and a Google I recently started pushing
Google+ users to start YouTube account

514
00:30:54,130 --> 00:30:56,330
or convert their existing ones to use
their

515
00:30:56,330 --> 00:30:59,710
real name as a as on Google+ rather than
the YouTube username

516
00:30:59,710 --> 00:31:02,780
and so we're seeing the sort of creep in
its not just what you doing on that

517
00:31:02,780 --> 00:31:05,230
social networker on that blocking
certain services are planned for

518
00:31:05,230 --> 00:31:05,860
whatever

519
00:31:05,860 --> 00:31:09,330
it's on the way to connect more of what
you do across the web to

520
00:31:09,330 --> 00:31:13,679
your identity rather than a yeah
thinking on one place

521
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:16,740
I think that's an excellent observation
certainly there

522
00:31:16,740 --> 00:31:20,030
there are efforts by large companies to
create the sort have

523
00:31:20,030 --> 00:31:23,560
monolithic identity I and there

524
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:26,580
there is a a very interesting related
problem that happens when

525
00:31:26,580 --> 00:31:29,629
company that allows that allows Sudan

526
00:31:29,630 --> 00:31:33,520
pseudonyms or anonymous accounts is
purchased by a company

527
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:38,300
good insists on real names policies what
happens to all those accounts

528
00:31:38,300 --> 00:31:41,830
and you can see something very
interesting happening when

529
00:31:41,830 --> 00:31:45,810
with this a.m. conversion process that
happening

530
00:31:45,810 --> 00:31:49,080
a between a Google+ accounts

531
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:52,850
and YouTube right now are you have the
option to sort of merger Google+ account

532
00:31:52,850 --> 00:31:53,300
which

533
00:31:53,300 --> 00:31:57,300
presumably has a real name on it and
your YouTube account which you may have

534
00:31:57,300 --> 00:31:58,220
made you know

535
00:31:58,220 --> 00:32:01,320
5 6 10 years ago

536
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:04,639
and contain some sorta a other synonym

537
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:07,760
on I do appreciate that Google

538
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:11,030
did not do this automatically and did
not

539
00:32:11,030 --> 00:32:14,930
automatically Oct people into merging
these two account so you have

540
00:32:14,930 --> 00:32:19,870
you have a choice a but I think that
that is definitely a trend that will be

541
00:32:19,870 --> 00:32:20,860
seeing more for the future

542
00:32:20,860 --> 00:32:25,400
a more questions

543
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:28,810
I was on the problem set a limit on the
Internet ok

544
00:32:28,810 --> 00:32:31,928
what one more question so

545
00:32:31,929 --> 00:32:34,990
on how does the rubber meets the road
what

546
00:32:34,990 --> 00:32:39,030
what influence can IFAB specifically how

547
00:32:39,030 --> 00:32:43,000
how does the FF exert influence over the
years

548
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:46,530
private companies with their private
social networks that they're creating

549
00:32:46,530 --> 00:32:50,000
how can we affect what they do well
there are a couple of different things

550
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,020
that we do

551
00:32:51,020 --> 00:32:55,720
a one a the most notable know bernie is
something very similar to what happened

552
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:56,880
to

553
00:32:56,880 --> 00:33:00,110
on well gone im which was that a

554
00:33:00,110 --> 00:33:04,630
some important person who really needed
to maintain their anonymity online

555
00:33:04,630 --> 00:33:09,260
on you know working from and
authoritarian regime towards political

556
00:33:09,260 --> 00:33:10,590
goals

557
00:33:10,590 --> 00:33:14,520
gets suspended on Facebook and he called
us

558
00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:18,460
and then we call Facebook and we say hey
let this guy back on

559
00:33:18,460 --> 00:33:22,870
and they say well a gas

560
00:33:22,870 --> 00:33:26,060
but here's the thing: I don't scale

561
00:33:26,060 --> 00:33:29,310
ok and if you don't know who I am

562
00:33:29,310 --> 00:33:33,159
and you can't call me and you don't know
that you have a choice

563
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:38,230
I can't help and that's one of the most
important reasons why the policies need

564
00:33:38,230 --> 00:33:38,990
to change

565
00:33:38,990 --> 00:33:42,330
and this continued are sorta

566
00:33:42,330 --> 00:33:45,590
back-room deal we help you piecemeal

567
00:33:45,590 --> 00:33:50,850
on policy is is simply not working we
need to have good policies in the first

568
00:33:50,850 --> 00:33:51,440
place

569
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:54,510
not policy is that we just kinda

570
00:33:54,510 --> 00:33:59,150
fix ad hoc

571
00:33:59,150 --> 00:34:02,850
so I guess I was wondering if you think
that there's also a

572
00:34:02,850 --> 00:34:06,810
good reason for enforcing real names or
at least

573
00:34:06,810 --> 00:34:09,960
wanting to have like a good reason for
students because

574
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:13,940
isn't it kinda annoying on a social
network to see people you know by one

575
00:34:13,940 --> 00:34:14,600
name

576
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:17,949
going by another and you know kinda

577
00:34:17,949 --> 00:34:22,899
breaking reality from what the exists on
the social network

578
00:34:22,899 --> 00:34:27,339
I don't think that my annoyance or
feeling the reality has been broken in

579
00:34:27,340 --> 00:34:28,370
some way

580
00:34:28,370 --> 00:34:32,810
is another reason to impose on someone
else's decision about how they want to

581
00:34:32,810 --> 00:34:34,949
present themselves online

582
00:34:34,949 --> 00:34:37,969
more like that you would prefer that
there's a good reason or that they have

583
00:34:37,970 --> 00:34:38,679
a reason

584
00:34:38,679 --> 00:34:43,830
not just and I what they have to justify
themselves to me

585
00:34:43,830 --> 00:34:45,899
i mean

586
00:34:45,899 --> 00:34:48,679
well yeah I mean I'm saying that like a

587
00:34:48,679 --> 00:34:52,690
if you're trying to connect real people
with their real friends

588
00:34:52,690 --> 00:34:56,570
that there's I some sort oblique

589
00:34:56,570 --> 00:35:01,730
human desire to kind as have everyone
kinda get into the same ball

590
00:35:01,730 --> 00:35:06,000
you put them in the rest at the time
even even on the social network

591
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:09,880
I mean just to be a devil's advocate
certainly the desire exists

592
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:16,880
but the it is it is not enough a reason
to take choice away from users

593
00:35:18,630 --> 00:35:23,660
I mean of course they are so many very
strong arguments for allowing people to

594
00:35:23,660 --> 00:35:24,200
choose

595
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:27,260
how they present themselves online on

596
00:35:27,260 --> 00:35:32,310
that I don't feel they are outweighed by
but I find this really annoying

597
00:35:32,310 --> 00:35:35,980
I am perhaps taking a cheap shot

598
00:35:35,980 --> 00:35:39,980
yeah well I mean I'm just trying to be a
devil's advocate

599
00:35:39,980 --> 00:35:44,000
for you know because I mean people have
all these

600
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:48,880
desires for community by are they don't
necessarily

601
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:52,119
you know always like being in a
community

602
00:35:52,119 --> 00:35:55,300
so we should force them to be in
communities

603
00:35:55,300 --> 00:35:58,420
II think that we need to give people the
choice to

604
00:35:58,420 --> 00:36:02,500
but that people push back against it
because they like

605
00:36:02,500 --> 00:36:06,859
you know they like you know John to be
John not John to be

606
00:36:06,859 --> 00:36:09,880
John except on Facebook where he is like
you know

607
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:15,670
Bob some other name it is true that
there are people like that

608
00:36:15,670 --> 00:36:20,990
a thank you for your comment them

609
00:36:20,990 --> 00:36:25,960
and i cant help but notice that your
comment is very very Harold who

610
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:29,869
the arguments that were made early
during the Nemours

611
00:36:29,869 --> 00:36:33,770
where both from gruel and from a second
chance

612
00:36:33,770 --> 00:36:39,780
saying that arm if you don't use your
real name on Google then how are your

613
00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:41,210
friends going to find you

614
00:36:41,210 --> 00:36:44,300
are and I would say that a hacker
convention

615
00:36:44,300 --> 00:36:47,359
yes and I i would say that this is
exactly backwards

616
00:36:47,359 --> 00:36:51,509
arm if you'd aren't allowed to use
whatever in named you want

617
00:36:51,510 --> 00:36:54,609
then how are your friends going to find
him I

618
00:36:54,609 --> 00:36:58,819
because for example I don't know how
many have you know a statics

619
00:36:58,820 --> 00:37:02,690
I he's when the guys here I happen to
know his legal name

620
00:37:02,690 --> 00:37:06,810
but most people don't and I never call
him that

621
00:37:06,810 --> 00:37:11,290
and if I went looking for him it's not
what I would look for

622
00:37:11,290 --> 00:37:14,520
and if he wasn't allowed to go buy a
statics

623
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:18,560
I we will now be able to find him arm

624
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:22,790
and embed that argument is an argument

625
00:37:22,790 --> 00:37:25,859
against requiring people to use

626
00:37:25,859 --> 00:37:29,299
some particular name that they don't
want to use finally

627
00:37:29,300 --> 00:37:32,750
there are people who do not use their
real names for safety reasons

628
00:37:32,750 --> 00:37:37,290
and when you create me a social network
that requires people to use their real

629
00:37:37,290 --> 00:37:40,430
names just for your overall comfort what
you're doing is

630
00:37:40,430 --> 00:37:43,740
you're not making an inclusive network
you're making a network

631
00:37:43,740 --> 00:37:47,359
only four people who don't have safety
concerns

632
00:37:47,359 --> 00:37:50,450
only four people who are in

633
00:37:50,450 --> 00:37:53,560
you know who don't have minority
opinions or

634
00:37:53,560 --> 00:37:57,390
who have never done anything
controversial or have nothing to lose

635
00:37:57,390 --> 00:38:01,089
and I don't think that you can really
build

636
00:38:01,090 --> 00:38:04,130
and inclusive don't work without getting
people this kind of choice

637
00:38:04,130 --> 00:38:07,840
this is

638
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:11,340
kinda another devil's advocate question
often I i was wondering

639
00:38:11,340 --> 00:38:15,590
every little battle is important bites
considering how our privacy is being

640
00:38:15,590 --> 00:38:17,520
invaded from so many other angles

641
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:20,720
why do we draw the line here and not
somewhere else

642
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:25,090
or why why should we fight this battle
and now focus our energy on another one

643
00:38:25,090 --> 00:38:28,100
well as it turns out

644
00:38:28,100 --> 00:38:31,220
I its it's not a zero-sum game if we

645
00:38:31,220 --> 00:38:35,830
spend are our energy fighting real names
policy is

646
00:38:35,830 --> 00:38:40,740
online I we do not lose our on energy to

647
00:38:40,740 --> 00:38:44,730
fights on invasions of privacy by

648
00:38:44,730 --> 00:38:48,690
corporations or people spying on us
because

649
00:38:48,690 --> 00:38:51,910
a web sites use first-rate

650
00:38:51,910 --> 00:38:56,390
HTTP instead HTTPS by default we can do
all these things at once

651
00:38:56,390 --> 00:39:00,950
and I submit as Exhibit A a at the
Electronic Frontier Foundation where we

652
00:39:00,950 --> 00:39:03,300
do in fact do all these things at once

653
00:39:03,300 --> 00:39:07,690
on I do think that this is an especially
important issue

654
00:39:07,690 --> 00:39:12,170
because activism will always happen in
the place where many people congregate

655
00:39:12,170 --> 00:39:13,920
and in

656
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:18,339
for better or for worse I in some ways
Facebook became that place

657
00:39:18,339 --> 00:39:21,359
I'll there there's a

658
00:39:21,359 --> 00:39:25,210
a Tunisian activist named Sami Ben
Gharbia

659
00:39:25,210 --> 00:39:28,980
who described the way in which the
Tunisian government

660
00:39:28,980 --> 00:39:33,920
slowly but surely shot down or blocked
just about every

661
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:38,780
method love are communicating and
sharing videos with masses

662
00:39:38,780 --> 00:39:42,790
I in Tunisia aside from Facebook

663
00:39:42,790 --> 00:39:47,390
18 Facebook with the only platform in
which they could compare sorta

664
00:39:47,390 --> 00:39:51,200
conductor their revolution online and
that's the reason why

665
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:54,500
it was so essentials for the revolution
on

666
00:39:54,500 --> 00:39:58,180
I think that if a if Facebook

667
00:39:58,180 --> 00:40:01,919
and Google and other large companies are
going to be the

668
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:05,680
the battleground where a where these
things happen

669
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:09,169
then we absolutely need to face them
because

670
00:40:09,170 --> 00:40:14,530
people's lives are at stake thank you

671
00:40:14,530 --> 00:40:18,010
I'm I just a okay I don't know anything
about law

672
00:40:18,010 --> 00:40:21,250
at all and I don't even offer makes
sense but it sounds like

673
00:40:21,250 --> 00:40:24,990
there needs to be a legal right privacy
online and

674
00:40:24,990 --> 00:40:28,089
that maybe like one of the only ways to
get

675
00:40:28,089 --> 00:40:31,690
companies have financial incentives to
per prevent you from doing that to help

676
00:40:31,690 --> 00:40:34,339
them is that possible is that something
that people should fight for

677
00:40:34,339 --> 00:40:37,759
like well we want to block the first men

678
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:41,550
you see it power on one hand you have a
first amendment right

679
00:40:41,550 --> 00:40:44,790
to call yourself whatever you want I the

680
00:40:44,790 --> 00:40:48,690
company which is hosting your speech has
a first amendment right to host

681
00:40:48,690 --> 00:40:52,240
whatever kind of speech they won and
yeah to set the rules

682
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:55,490
however they want I think that rather
than

683
00:40:55,490 --> 00:40:58,530
calling for a legal on

684
00:40:58,530 --> 00:41:01,730
a legal remedy out what we really need
is just

685
00:41:01,730 --> 00:41:05,700
a broader and ecosystem

686
00:41:05,700 --> 00:41:09,150
I love social networks where people can
share this kind of information with each

687
00:41:09,150 --> 00:41:09,700
other

688
00:41:09,700 --> 00:41:13,070
it's okay if somewhere out there there's
the

689
00:41:13,070 --> 00:41:15,930
there's a social network that requires
people to use their real names just one

690
00:41:15,930 --> 00:41:16,379
other

691
00:41:16,380 --> 00:41:23,380
are also social networks that don't
require you to Israel am make sense

692
00:41:24,020 --> 00:41:27,530
is there any privacy reason why names
need to be globally

693
00:41:27,530 --> 00:41:31,180
the same for every viewer versus my
cabinet I have statics real name in my

694
00:41:31,180 --> 00:41:31,690
phone

695
00:41:31,690 --> 00:41:36,190
because I no im under that name I
doesn't hurt him that I haven't saved

696
00:41:36,190 --> 00:41:38,130
under that name in my phonebook

697
00:41:38,130 --> 00:41:42,440
I am there's no reason why at the
presentation on log into Facebook

698
00:41:42,440 --> 00:41:46,710
if I see his name that is a noname shape
name it doesn't appear

699
00:41:46,710 --> 00:41:49,980
I could have it I could save a local
nickname for a min have a display that

700
00:41:49,980 --> 00:41:50,609
way

701
00:41:50,609 --> 00:41:54,630
which solves the problem users not
liking tunes that are chosen by the

702
00:41:54,630 --> 00:41:55,640
people

703
00:41:55,640 --> 00:41:59,190
as any privacy concerns that ur other
none

704
00:41:59,190 --> 00:42:02,859
the I can think about the top of my head
in and

705
00:42:02,859 --> 00:42:05,910
aside from the possibility that linking
your

706
00:42:05,910 --> 00:42:09,740
your real name to a pseudonym made years
somehow

707
00:42:09,740 --> 00:42:13,200
a may somehow be dangerous if other
people knowing

708
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:16,230
what your real name is in Houston and
together

709
00:42:16,230 --> 00:42:20,830
I is dangerous than that's probably not
a very good idea

710
00:42:20,830 --> 00:42:26,060
back board

711
00:42:26,060 --> 00:42:28,850
one more instance of the year the river
hitting the road

712
00:42:28,850 --> 00:42:33,850
a.m. as in germany early days as the
discussions on the most hashtag

713
00:42:33,850 --> 00:42:39,279
there was on complaining that once they
read Google+ account has been suspended

714
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:42,480
that they were losing access to things
like email

715
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:46,200
but also certain numbers have their
functionalities on their Android phones

716
00:42:46,200 --> 00:42:49,630
and hood tell I don't know whether to
believe

717
00:42:49,630 --> 00:42:53,540
that Facebook is thinking of getting
into the smartphone market

718
00:42:53,540 --> 00:42:57,340
how do we deal with this interaction
between

719
00:42:57,340 --> 00:43:00,780
the Moors related problems and

720
00:43:00,780 --> 00:43:04,150
people's actual physical films

721
00:43:04,150 --> 00:43:08,490
and the GPS states that comes with it
well I think you've identified a

722
00:43:08,490 --> 00:43:12,750
very alarming trend which again is just
so this consolidation about identity

723
00:43:12,750 --> 00:43:16,650
across all facets of our lives and

724
00:43:16,650 --> 00:43:20,150
it is true that when when people are
having their Google+ account suspended

725
00:43:20,150 --> 00:43:21,200
that they were losing

726
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:24,430
other types a a Google functionality

727
00:43:24,430 --> 00:43:28,080
%uh when we questioned Google about this
the presented this is a bug

728
00:43:28,080 --> 00:43:31,290
they sent group

729
00:43:31,290 --> 00:43:35,160
we didn't mean to be not be able to use
Google Reader

730
00:43:35,160 --> 00:43:40,040
on I'm unable to comments on

731
00:43:40,040 --> 00:43:43,460
I'm whether or not that's actually about
but does certainly that is

732
00:43:43,460 --> 00:43:46,630
the that is one of the greatest dangers
abyss

733
00:43:46,630 --> 00:43:49,930
ongoing consolidation identity the when
if you

734
00:43:49,930 --> 00:43:53,609
present yourself under a pseudonym that
if you if you get to spend in one place

735
00:43:53,610 --> 00:43:54,290
that you lose

736
00:43:54,290 --> 00:43:57,820
are kinda access to other fun features a
the Internet

737
00:43:57,820 --> 00:44:02,590
sir I have a devil's advocate comment
rather questions okay

738
00:44:02,590 --> 00:44:06,490
bring it call %uh so I think it's really
important to fully understand the system

739
00:44:06,490 --> 00:44:09,930
in order to be on the change in and I
fully in agreement with that

740
00:44:09,930 --> 00:44:13,020
be able to use in inspecting the
motivation between can't be

741
00:44:13,020 --> 00:44:16,210
with companies like these when Google
for using real names is not for

742
00:44:16,210 --> 00:44:17,010
advertising

743
00:44:17,010 --> 00:44:20,450
because I think that the best place
tracking are not using real name there's

744
00:44:20,450 --> 00:44:21,400
other ways of tightening

745
00:44:21,400 --> 00:44:24,420
anything that that edges making that

746
00:44:24,420 --> 00:44:28,620
the main driver for them is the creation
of value which for them as growth citing

747
00:44:28,620 --> 00:44:30,839
the reason they use names because that
allows

748
00:44:30,840 --> 00:44:34,820
more people would have that have they
don't have the same concerns as we did

749
00:44:34,820 --> 00:44:36,580
our privacy to adopt more easily

750
00:44:36,580 --> 00:44:39,670
setting you too can understand the
motivations to be able to change the

751
00:44:39,670 --> 00:44:40,220
system

752
00:44:40,220 --> 00:44:43,350
am Not sure what the answer is but maybe
it you know in the short term some Panda

753
00:44:43,350 --> 00:44:44,960
and map where we can use

754
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:48,510
name like names but I just have a
distributed map to have those

755
00:44:48,510 --> 00:44:52,690
map to whatever we want to be searchable
and indexable by

756
00:44:52,690 --> 00:44:57,020
well I i think that the the best counter
to that as the

757
00:44:57,020 --> 00:45:01,190
norms change over time on at this time

758
00:45:01,190 --> 00:45:06,650
a non-technical people are sometimes
scared off by noname shaped names were

759
00:45:06,650 --> 00:45:07,590
named count them

760
00:45:07,590 --> 00:45:11,150
encounter them on the internet but that
is because

761
00:45:11,150 --> 00:45:14,240
often the only time that they encounter
these names

762
00:45:14,240 --> 00:45:17,270
I is in some strange and unfamiliar

763
00:45:17,270 --> 00:45:21,220
you know technical context if they saw
names like this more often

764
00:45:21,220 --> 00:45:24,410
I i posit that perhaps they would be
less frightened on

765
00:45:24,410 --> 00:45:27,850
I it is not necessarily incumbent upon
us to change

766
00:45:27,850 --> 00:45:34,850
a they can change as well

767
00:45:36,140 --> 00:45:41,229
arm I think we as a community really get
these issues but I'm sure many bus

768
00:45:41,229 --> 00:45:44,640
have friends who are you technical users
how do we

769
00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:48,239
open dialogue with our friends and
family who don't understand these issues

770
00:45:48,239 --> 00:45:50,369
and explain to them why this is so
important

771
00:45:50,369 --> 00:45:54,619
well on often

772
00:45:54,619 --> 00:45:58,099
the reason why people don't understand
why sit in a mini

773
00:45:58,099 --> 00:46:01,880
on the internet is so important is
because it's not him

774
00:46:01,880 --> 00:46:05,229
it's not important to them does not
impact their own lives and so they have

775
00:46:05,229 --> 00:46:07,299
difficulty thinking a use case

776
00:46:07,299 --> 00:46:11,189
I in which using your your real name
online

777
00:46:11,189 --> 00:46:14,219
would be other embarrassing or

778
00:46:14,219 --> 00:46:17,449
unpleasant or life-threatening I

779
00:46:17,449 --> 00:46:21,439
so generally the the way that I approach
this is by presenting them with these

780
00:46:21,439 --> 00:46:22,089
cases

781
00:46:22,089 --> 00:46:26,538
no you me be comfortable using your your
real name online for everything you do

782
00:46:26,539 --> 00:46:27,949
but imagine if you will

783
00:46:27,949 --> 00:46:31,219
that you are a woman with a stalker or

784
00:46:31,219 --> 00:46:35,170
you are a dissident in china or

785
00:46:35,170 --> 00:46:38,219
you are a hacker

786
00:46:38,219 --> 00:46:42,979
conference in New York and there there
are many many reasons why people want to

787
00:46:42,979 --> 00:46:44,059
protect their names

788
00:46:44,059 --> 00:46:48,390
and usually once went to bring up his
other use cases

789
00:46:48,390 --> 00:46:52,308
it's it's very helpful arm usually
that's true but sometimes having 100

790
00:46:52,309 --> 00:46:54,699
people who still just don't seem to care

791
00:46:54,699 --> 00:46:58,549
with I'll anything might suggest for
that

792
00:46:58,549 --> 00:47:01,859
situation I mean well did depends on the

793
00:47:01,859 --> 00:47:05,848
basis if they're not carrying there
there are people who don't care because

794
00:47:05,849 --> 00:47:09,679
it doesn't matter to them that a service
or that the Internet

795
00:47:09,679 --> 00:47:13,640
might not be for everyone in which case
you you address that issue

796
00:47:13,640 --> 00:47:17,509
there are are people who simply cannot

797
00:47:17,509 --> 00:47:20,479
empathize with people who are not like
themselves in which case they have

798
00:47:20,479 --> 00:47:21,179
should seek

799
00:47:21,179 --> 00:47:26,049
be and so yeah it's really all about
Sonic getting

800
00:47:26,049 --> 00:47:29,069
getting to the root of the criticism in
finding out why they still don't get

801
00:47:29,069 --> 00:47:34,269
thank you the problem cell

802
00:47:34,269 --> 00:47:38,420
it seems like the that compromise the
Google came up with the

803
00:47:38,420 --> 00:47:43,140
just giving Sydney meter famous people
doesn't really nice early meet all the

804
00:47:43,140 --> 00:47:44,890
needs of say activists are

805
00:47:44,890 --> 00:47:49,239
whole other swath of people do you have
plans to push

806
00:47:49,239 --> 00:47:53,969
further term go to a place where their
schools in a mini

807
00:47:53,969 --> 00:47:57,549
yes

808
00:47:57,549 --> 00:48:01,849
I there there's absolutely no doubt that
I was displeased by

809
00:48:01,849 --> 00:48:05,869
a by Google+ is compromise and also by
the compromise that

810
00:48:05,869 --> 00:48:09,579
that Facebook finally reached in regards
to cinema de

811
00:48:09,579 --> 00:48:13,670
precisely because it amounts to a
two-tiered system in which you can have

812
00:48:13,670 --> 00:48:16,259
a pseudonym provided the you are
sufficiently famous

813
00:48:16,259 --> 00:48:19,869
on the sort of people the

814
00:48:19,869 --> 00:48:22,900
that I generally depend at work are not

815
00:48:22,900 --> 00:48:26,019
famous and and they need help

816
00:48:26,019 --> 00:48:29,579
I at the same time I

817
00:48:29,579 --> 00:48:32,689
I'm not sure how much further we can
push these companies

818
00:48:32,689 --> 00:48:36,049
they feel that they have already made a
compromise on and

819
00:48:36,049 --> 00:48:40,160
frequently what I do is I suggest thats
people who are

820
00:48:40,160 --> 00:48:43,819
really concerned about on

821
00:48:43,819 --> 00:48:47,349
about their privacy online or concerned
about maintaining their pseudonym any

822
00:48:47,349 --> 00:48:48,959
because their lives are in danger

823
00:48:48,959 --> 00:48:52,009
I am should avoid

824
00:48:52,009 --> 00:48:55,859
these networks with very serious films
office its

825
00:48:55,859 --> 00:48:59,999
not the world's most useful advice
because as I said most

826
00:48:59,999 --> 00:49:04,380
on most activists go where the people
are

827
00:49:04,380 --> 00:49:08,509
and he told them don't go where the
people are bill probably still go anyway

828
00:49:08,509 --> 00:49:12,359
so there's a there's a problem that
continues more research is needed

829
00:49:12,359 --> 00:49:19,049
we got

830
00:49:19,049 --> 00:49:22,850
solved

831
00:49:22,850 --> 00:49:26,279
I B Internet is now free thank you very
much

832
00:49:26,280 --> 00:49:30,040
on
