for the fiber harbors

116
00:07:19,490 --> 00:07:23,850
at work work pretty well we were gonna
ham radio

117
00:07:23,850 --> 00:07:27,880
operation yeah and so that was actually

118
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:32,219
operation just blessed which is rulings

119
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:36,060
throwing everything you have at the wall
and see what sticks and if you're gonna

120
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:37,600
fail fail fast

121
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:40,910
hard next works so

122
00:07:40,910 --> 00:07:44,120
I got involved when II

123
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:48,700
so I got involved when telecom put out a
call for ham radio operators

124
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:52,930
I got my license in the States and I
happen to be living in Belgium

125
00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:57,570
so I was like well maybe we can do it we
can do in a chip shot

126
00:07:57,570 --> 00:08:01,590
out Egypt's a long shot but let's see if
we can do it unfortunately that

127
00:08:01,590 --> 00:08:03,850
particular operation suffer from certain
black

128
00:08:03,850 --> 00:08:07,380
research because it turns out that's
there aren't that many ham radio

129
00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:07,980
operators

130
00:08:07,980 --> 00:08:11,310
first place and most of them were
involved military

131
00:08:11,310 --> 00:08:15,340
so hoops hoops

132
00:08:15,340 --> 00:08:18,510
right he was it was interesting op we

133
00:08:18,510 --> 00:08:22,550
we did we did here what we what we think
may have been some traffic

134
00:08:22,550 --> 00:08:25,570
but I think week-and-a-half like

135
00:08:25,570 --> 00:08:29,710
screw it let's move on to some to
something else Belfast feel hard

136
00:08:29,710 --> 00:08:33,440
some other stuff that did work really
well we put together

137
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:36,560
basically fax use Google and

138
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:40,110
found basically every fax number gypped
that we could

139
00:08:40,110 --> 00:08:43,539
universities copy shops hospitals

140
00:08:43,539 --> 00:08:47,000
and put together fax

141
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,520
communications device like the numbers
style online

142
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:53,699
contact information and medical advice

143
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:57,040
treatments for tear gas and basically
got

144
00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:00,329
just volunteers in town free
international back services

145
00:09:00,330 --> 00:09:04,200
and injures set their that worked really
well

146
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:08,480
at work then project

147
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:12,590
talk Minister parallel all is some guys

148
00:09:12,590 --> 00:09:15,980
and map the entire Egyptian internet 36
hours

149
00:09:15,980 --> 00:09:20,720
and so there's machines operated 5,000
she's up

150
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:23,900
quickly and then the injected

151
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:27,860
you know human messages into the web
server logs

152
00:09:27,860 --> 00:09:32,490
so they did stuff like get your telecom
X internet

153
00:09:32,490 --> 00:09:35,910
he's yet print

154
00:09:35,910 --> 00:09:39,170
online number yet here's what's going on

155
00:09:39,170 --> 00:09:42,310
by the way we have the utility upon get
her but they may want to take a look at

156
00:09:42,310 --> 00:09:45,220
it yet with us

157
00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:48,530
you know sometimes it's hard to tell if
messages get received

158
00:09:48,530 --> 00:09:51,980
we think that one may not entirely sure
on

159
00:09:51,980 --> 00:09:55,250
certainly call I you know like I think

160

the world

162
00:10:00,110 --> 00:10:03,580
we're trying to rebuild

163
00:10:03,580 --> 00:10:07,640
and you know aside

164
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:11,390
good stuff like people

165
00:10:11,390 --> 00:10:15,540
shit school she's like

166
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:19,020
when egypt was cut off from rest to the
net a few was quite a few of us

167
00:10:19,020 --> 00:10:22,100
join telecom it's because it was an
interesting technical challenge how did

168
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:22,780
they do it

169
00:10:22,780 --> 00:10:26,000
mean there was a lot of good information
coming to Egypt obviously so

170
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,160
a few was got together and figured out
roughly how they went about it we

171
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:30,959
started working on ways to circumvent
that

172
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:34,310
arm the technical challenges have been
impressive and nothing short of

173
00:10:34,310 --> 00:10:36,510
interesting you know

174
00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:40,090
on top of all this stuff is kinda
standard toward

175
00:10:40,090 --> 00:10:45,830
proxy setting rejections teaching people
how to use it all in classes in private

176
00:10:45,830 --> 00:10:46,520
channels

177
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:49,650
holding classes in private chat stuff
like that

178
00:10:49,650 --> 00:10:53,280
and so before before the net tax cut all
we would get

179
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:56,740
entirely you get Gyptian dire si locked

180
00:10:56,740 --> 00:11:00,570
for reaching Twitter and take news
reports and photos from them

181
00:11:00,570 --> 00:11:05,860
and using our like on a sec human proxy
that's the kinda facilitation

182
00:11:05,860 --> 00:11:10,120
communication

183
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:14,370
was awesome came online

184
00:11:14,370 --> 00:11:17,800
his his father

185
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:21,620
budgeted help

186
00:11:21,620 --> 00:11:24,640
Morse code to Twitter really

187
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:28,600
so people they were we had setup

188
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:33,800
Morse code nice

189
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:36,800
yeah I think we were talking about if
that's that's

190
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:40,300
decentralize this is I mean we're we're
not we're all we're not we're not all

191
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:42,350
like to wear what everybody else is
doing

192
00:11:42,350 --> 00:11:46,950
but it all an emergency blends together
what succeed succeed

193
00:11:46,950 --> 00:11:51,670
bills passed yeah and the idea and
sometimes ideas such as get tossed out

194
00:11:51,670 --> 00:11:55,560
as well hey wonder if this is possible a
couple people quietly grab it go off

195
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:56,710
into a channel

196
00:11:56,710 --> 00:12:00,020
they'll figure it out write the code
they'll test it then gonna play it and

197
00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:07,020
we'll find a week later

198
00:12:07,690 --> 00:12:10,930
yeah because eventually determine
Young's

199
00:12:10,930 --> 00:12:17,930
and the world you know how successful

200
00:12:18,010 --> 00:12:24,770
you know the answer brings good

201
00:12:24,770 --> 00:12:31,699
big plays last year

202
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:37,360
run last jump

203
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:42,930
bald Egypt surgeon in a back on

204
00:12:42,930 --> 00:12:47,480
on user other nations we did

205
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:51,060
one you excised country

206
00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:54,910
just another Nexus said people but not
like

207
00:12:54,910 --> 00:12:58,189
wasn't selling jeans help at all

208
00:12:58,190 --> 00:13:02,380
so mom you 22nd

209
00:13:02,380 --> 00:13:05,480
in Times Union all ironies

210
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:08,660
my keys answered home big

211
00:13:08,660 --> 00:13:12,819
thing that jumped out now be was good

212
00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:16,320
series under sanctions for the US

213
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:20,570
technical reasons for years for decades
at this point

214
00:13:20,570 --> 00:13:24,000
25 yet because we didn't want to your

215
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,630
we didn't want them to get anything one
smile

216
00:13:27,630 --> 00:13:32,140
blue coat is an American company based
in Sunnyvale that cells

217
00:13:32,140 --> 00:13:35,640
it its proxy the proxy device

218
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:39,210
that also doesn't he the

219
00:13:39,210 --> 00:13:42,480
though showed up thing we noticed was
that there is no FTP

220
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:45,740
on the IP address fighters way mister

221
00:13:45,740 --> 00:13:50,870
point to be fair organization notices

222
00:13:50,870 --> 00:13:53,880
others we clicking

223
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:58,390
month there and 18 turned up

224
00:13:58,390 --> 00:14:01,670
down different

225
00:14:01,670 --> 00:14:05,350
on and released

226
00:14:05,350 --> 00:14:09,060
first we did some reaction now

227
00:14:09,060 --> 00:14:12,320
inside user

228
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:16,080
mission in there merely because website
report crafted

229
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:20,150
how country a lot on which one

230
00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:23,360
peas track I mean

231
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:26,540
three-headed

232
00:14:26,540 --> 00:14:29,969
your point from with said each year

233
00:14:29,970 --> 00:14:33,220
and collected loaded software

234
00:14:33,220 --> 00:14:38,420
and present you that's pretty

235
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:42,130
I think we spend three days straight
going through the logs by hand analyzing

236
00:14:42,130 --> 00:14:43,960
them seem a bit down in there

237
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:47,320
arm from it we were able to deduce

238
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:50,540
about a third the rule sets that because
we're running any given time

239
00:14:50,540 --> 00:14:54,120
arm somehow they managed to block every
Justin Bieber

240
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:57,550
fansite on the face on the Internet

241
00:14:57,550 --> 00:15:00,680
why they refused export this none of us
know but

242
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:04,590
that technology meant is nothing short
of phenomenal arm

243
00:15:04,590 --> 00:15:09,440
they blocked a lot love social
networking sites which we expect

244
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:12,670
are the block some you wouldn't expect
we found out later because those sites

245
00:15:12,670 --> 00:15:13,490
specialized

246
00:15:13,490 --> 00:15:16,970
in arm a city-based

247
00:15:16,970 --> 00:15:20,850
instant messaging alongside up the sort
that G chat users where you have a

248
00:15:20,850 --> 00:15:22,500
little window popup in it uses

249
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:25,900
a taxi magic to final its messages from
person to person

250
00:15:25,900 --> 00:15:30,910
arm they blocked a lot of online games
and practically all a guy who's games

251
00:15:30,910 --> 00:15:32,150
because they all seem to for

252
00:15:32,150 --> 00:15:35,560
they all seem to support instant
messaging functionality in one in in one

253
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:36,400
way or another

254
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:41,620
which was really interesting and they
thought that far ahead arm

255
00:15:41,620 --> 00:15:45,660
I think really I think the last 72 hours
before we all fell asleep

256
00:15:45,660 --> 00:15:49,300
that was just a marathon we did to be
cleared like

257
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:52,500
these devices in because marketing
literature the

258
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:57,260
are able to distinguish real time speed
in the fiber between up to use your

259
00:15:57,260 --> 00:15:58,290
Facebook wall

260
00:15:58,290 --> 00:16:02,140
and farm and in a corporate environment

261
00:16:02,140 --> 00:16:05,819
the actually block harmful outright
rather just slow it down

262
00:16:05,820 --> 00:16:09,180
because you block it out right employees
get pissed off you slide down the

263
00:16:09,180 --> 00:16:09,810
skateboard

264
00:16:09,810 --> 00:16:14,950
back early fairly sophisticated piece of
hardware

265
00:16:14,950 --> 00:16:18,190
15 there we ones that have been
published

266
00:16:18,190 --> 00:16:22,570
used tears

267
00:16:22,570 --> 00:16:26,010
invest the there's another 10 see

268
00:16:26,010 --> 00:16:30,450
unauthorized because

269
00:16:30,450 --> 00:16:34,530
im one said

270
00:16:34,530 --> 00:16:37,920
so this stuff gets leaked

271
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:42,360
we write a story for slash the company
outright denies that these machines are

272
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:43,450
in Syria

273
00:16:43,450 --> 00:16:47,720
alright denied any evidence is hard all
like

274
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:51,700
lying to you file headers that line 395

275
00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:55,900
matters wild the serial number for every
device me they have they have to deny

276
00:16:55,900 --> 00:16:57,530
this because

277
00:16:57,530 --> 00:17:01,500
you know it's it's their butts on the
line I tire is not screwing around

278
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:06,140
tighter regulations are serious business
I mean if you remember the crib source

279
00:17:06,140 --> 00:17:09,800
nineteen nineties that was all about
hightower that was that was all about

280
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:10,609
getting

281
00:17:10,610 --> 00:17:15,340
photography yo allowed to be exported
outside the United States

282
00:17:15,339 --> 00:17:19,879
at all what we've actually found was
that in the logs themselves

283
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:23,470
these devices were calling home to
corporate headquarters up for heart

284
00:17:23,470 --> 00:17:25,310
monitoring software updates

285
00:17:25,310 --> 00:17:28,690
and collaborative filtering so that if
they sold locally

286
00:17:28,690 --> 00:17:33,070
some weird traffic recognized they would
send a sample that home in like

287
00:17:33,070 --> 00:17:36,570
to three hundred milliseconds a cluster
headquarters

288
00:17:36,570 --> 00:17:41,928
with you response back to the point
strap which headquarters used

289
00:17:41,929 --> 00:17:46,100
core services neighbors contract

290
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:49,640
because night down to be better than
their allotted

291
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:54,050
world and used here attention

292
00:17:54,050 --> 00:17:58,418
insofar as and Iraq by

293
00:17:58,419 --> 00:18:03,370
so this story eventually gets picked up
washington Post

294
00:18:03,370 --> 00:18:06,990
Wall Street Journal eventually got
mission at the company

295
00:18:06,990 --> 00:18:11,860
yes this stuff wind up in Syria no they
weren't looking at their internal logs

296
00:18:11,860 --> 00:18:15,400
and they have no incentive to you front

297
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:19,950
Wall Street Journal and then within
three months or so summer European guys

298
00:18:19,950 --> 00:18:22,980
you know hack policy in the European
Parliament

299
00:18:22,980 --> 00:18:26,910
which passed export controls and
censorship and surveillance technology

300
00:18:26,910 --> 00:18:30,070
and it never had and so

301
00:18:30,070 --> 00:18:33,360
from within a six-month timeframe just
like I'm

302
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:38,990
people can send chain in motion bands
like result in a change in international

303
00:18:38,990 --> 00:18:42,150
this this is where we're at with
technology right

304
00:18:42,150 --> 00:18:45,400
it's not perfect but still can work be
resellers and

305
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:49,429
why way Chinese manufacturing

306
00:18:49,429 --> 00:18:55,020
is really pushing the Syrian of green
sensors

307
00:18:55,020 --> 00:18:59,240
actually tried didn't actually track
down the resource sugar called

308
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:02,480
I Seattle somebody getting help and from
like ever

309
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:06,460
X-wing out anything out United States
ever get resolved by Guy

310
00:19:06,460 --> 00:19:10,020
and forever by it seems and poison

311
00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:13,500
but this kinda captures white I like
this nice out

312
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:17,830
about what we do really really technical
stuff like and mapping log house

313
00:19:17,830 --> 00:19:21,500
through the media from slash all the way
up to the wall street journal

314
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:25,470
and the policy side as well

315
00:19:25,470 --> 00:19:28,710
that's kind kind whole

316
00:19:28,710 --> 00:19:32,130
missus actually this is how much stuff
need

317
00:19:32,130 --> 00:19:39,130
actually like me me changes

318
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:44,580
on another the ass the things that I
comics is involved in

319
00:19:44,580 --> 00:19:48,689
is acid open source intelligence
analysis we have a project called blue

320
00:19:48,690 --> 00:19:49,280
cabinet

321
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:53,260
where we have been systematically
researching following the Nepali money

322
00:19:53,260 --> 00:19:54,390
chasing receipts

323
00:19:54,390 --> 00:19:57,560
and gather every scrap information
boiling it down

324
00:19:57,560 --> 00:20:00,918
checking it cross-checking at collating
at for

325
00:20:00,919 --> 00:20:04,770
every surveillance in censorship
technology manufacturer on this planet

326
00:20:04,770 --> 00:20:07,908
we've been at it for about nine months
now and

327
00:20:07,909 --> 00:20:12,050
we've been compiling dossiers which are
freely available on the internet on

328
00:20:12,050 --> 00:20:13,340
other wikis

329
00:20:13,340 --> 00:20:18,030
to basically name and shame every
company who is manufacturing every piece

330
00:20:18,030 --> 00:20:19,879
of censorship technology

331
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:23,340
who they sell it through and what
countries we now use it

332
00:20:23,340 --> 00:20:26,850
arm this has been a monumental task
because the internet is

333
00:20:26,850 --> 00:20:30,830
as get somebody to see information in
these is really is a C information

334
00:20:30,830 --> 00:20:35,360
and we've been spending way too much
time going through it all

335
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:39,340
composting the fact that we have posting
ranking

336
00:20:39,340 --> 00:20:43,270
and approving disproving hypotheses arm

337
00:20:43,270 --> 00:20:46,560
basically we've is we have a loosely
distributed

338
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:51,100
are decentralized open source
intelligence operation as well

339
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:55,580
we do about it sir

340
00:20:55,580 --> 00:20:58,870
you see other Jeep your I'm soared

341
00:20:58,870 --> 00:21:02,720
on record within up

342
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:06,179
I don't have definite second important

343
00:21:06,179 --> 00:21:10,470
iOS devices but there's a lot of open
source intelligence

344
00:21:10,470 --> 00:21:13,470
loves what's going on in Syria how it
works health

345
00:21:13,470 --> 00:21:16,590

346
00:21:16,590 --> 00:21:19,820
Minister pointy an answer particles

347
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:24,280
these signatures we know they have the
your we suspect the company

348
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:31,050
I I'm not jobs right now it's just a
matter of time before we find them

349
00:21:31,050 --> 00:21:35,460
nailing bastards can be fun

350
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:39,679
dude a guess the other interesting

351

experiment and series up

367
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:47,290
the more accurate the more risque

368
00:22:47,290 --> 00:22:52,668

00:22:52,669 --> 00:22:56,550
that we're providing you wanna one of
the things that we that we collect on

442
00:27:14,180 --> 00:27:17,260
whether something looks suspicious is

443
00:27:17,260 --> 00:27:21,610
actually and is actually like something
state-sponsored

444
00:27:21,610 --> 00:27:24,840
were whether it's co-author party like

445
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:28,120
like like hacker for instance or

446
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:31,600

California look like him so we were like

456
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:11,990
holy crap this has got to be like the
Syrian government trying to do man

457
00:28:11,990 --> 00:28:12,540
little thing

458
00:28:12,540 --> 00:28:16,200
so we reach out to Facebook

459
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:19,280
and we were like what's going on here a

460
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:22,660
and as it turned out home well

461
00:28:22,660 --> 00:28:26,130
over if especially dodgy thing right so
we we chased

462
00:28:26,130 --> 00:28:31,040
the searching and it turned out to have
been

463
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:34,240
issued by a NRA

464
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:37,760
that that was signed by the mt2

465
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:41,190
route that had supposedly been dropped

466
00:28:41,190 --> 00:28:45,970
from the the first tour that has
supposedly been dropped from all

467
00:28:45,970 --> 00:28:46,960
browsers

468
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:50,020
early 2010

469
00:28:50,020 --> 00:28:53,480
because work 1000

470
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:56,550
minsky done demonstrating

471
00:28:56,550 --> 00:29:00,230
mt2 was was serious cause weakness there

472
00:29:00,230 --> 00:29:03,480
so we totally thought just somebody had
like figured out how to break into

473
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:07,260
just just issued fixer as it turned out

474
00:29:07,260 --> 00:29:11,129
Facebook head bought a couple

475
00:29:11,130 --> 00:29:15,040
shirts and was and was only using on
like one load balancer

476
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:19,960
and so Mohammed just got lucky
apparently

477
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:23,320
so that fortunately

478
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:26,470
you know nobody died it was

479
00:29:26,470 --> 00:29:31,230
here which in that is very real concern
here

480
00:29:31,230 --> 00:29:35,020
you know

481
00:29:35,020 --> 00:29:39,960
here shell check

world

487
00:29:57,460 --> 00:30:02,460
talk more about that towards the end but
in places like Syria in particular

488
00:30:02,460 --> 00:30:07,130
ease please keep in mind that lake this
is not a place to go around and pony

489
00:30:07,130 --> 00:30:07,940
known for

490
00:30:07,940 --> 00:30:11,220
balls like is a really people's lives on
the line

491
00:30:11,220 --> 00:30:14,700
in this case in particularly weaving
reactor please come talk to us

492
00:30:14,700 --> 00:30:17,940
against working on this lake even if
you're on your own you¿re doing

493
00:30:17,940 --> 00:30:22,030
displease Lake the really easy much
better coordination among people

494
00:30:22,030 --> 00:30:26,440
working in this kind of activity space
were stepping on each other's toes

495
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:29,730
work you know we're all trying to do the
same thing

496
00:30:29,730 --> 00:30:34,110
I know we'll keep our sources close to
her bass for good reason you know

497
00:30:34,110 --> 00:30:37,130
we gotta start yeah and

498
00:30:37,130 --> 00:30:40,600
all of us here I think it's safe to say
are willing to teach whatever we know it

499
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:41,620
whoever asks

500
00:30:41,620 --> 00:30:45,429
om that's how we've been that I've been
helping people in other countries

501
00:30:45,429 --> 00:30:48,510
our design pattern is very simple but
it's on our website

502
00:30:48,510 --> 00:30:52,740
we believe in the love so we share as
much the date as we can

503
00:30:52,740 --> 00:30:56,030
we share as much as the knowledge is
we've accumulated as we can

504
00:30:56,030 --> 00:31:00,820
and is anybody at their would like to
join us and help you're welcome to do so

505

collective

506
00:31:04,179 --> 00:31:07,950
hands do sort of what we do but not
quite or use

507
00:31:07,950 --> 00:31:12,030

510
00:31:19,270 --> 00:31:22,740
seized

511
00:31:22,740 --> 00:31:25,870
not not like superheroes

512
00:31:25,870 --> 00:31:28,980

516
00:31:40,950 --> 00:31:42,820
been were tech support for the Arab
Spring

charge people on the ground lead the

518
00:31:46,590 --> 00:31:48,750
charge it's their country that's their
job

519

the other the other big project last 10
years

541
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:26,380
is that we're not not just like we do a

the site is tech support a lot of that
is just hang out on IRC

543
00:33:30,130 --> 00:33:34,049

but you know these just might

581
00:35:44,260 --> 00:35:48,119
yet start with starting with we almost
did during

582
00:35:48,119 --> 00:35:51,490
Egypt and Libya was an article which was
assailed

583

was to be 12 miles offshore

584
00:35:54,609 --> 00:35:58,680
we got donated some thanks and buncha

be sending sending wifi to shore

586
00:36:02,230 --> 00:36:05,589
bounce back and sending someone to shore
on the

587
00:36:05,589 --> 00:36:08,859
zodiac to get those and has backed like
furs

588
00:36:08,859 --> 00:36:12,980
try the telecom XT so here

589
00:36:12,980 --> 00:36:16,119
which email end up feeling things and
come together at the right time

590
00:36:16,119 --> 00:36:19,660
be started falling it wasn't feasible to
do any so

591
00:36:19,660 --> 00:36:22,920
telecom Navy telecom tech space

592
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:26,820
house at you we have

593
00:36:26,820 --> 00:36:30,609

on shown in is is grounded not to be

599
00:36:49,790 --> 00:36:54,140
should an unfortunate doesn't let people
contribute scan results

600
00:36:54,140 --> 00:36:58,049
so there's a lot of duplication work
just because

601
00:36:58,050 --> 00:37:02,760
maybe someone has done a bit as much air
yes is a list of about a dozen countries

that are

603
00:37:03,540 --> 00:37:07,220
we have which is a good reason to leave
highly censored using

604
00:37:07,220 --> 00:37:10,540
similar kind of equipment to what we saw
in Syria

605
00:37:10,540 --> 00:37:13,670
and you know so we've been doing the
scans rape is a

606
00:37:13,670 --> 00:37:17,170
like for doesn't guys like a massive
number IP's these

607
00:37:17,170 --> 00:37:21,170
he's a tiny country generals but still
him

608
00:37:21,170 --> 00:37:25,970
that now need to start getting done
through by

609
00:37:25,970 --> 00:37:29,150
and we you know you won't be able on
house

some other some other things but also
chain

639

work shell them

649
00:39:53,250 --> 00:39:56,260
really be using our

650
00:39:56,260 --> 00:40:00,500
trying signals drop archer

651
00:40:00,500 --> 00:40:04,220
common things can help

652
00:40:04,220 --> 00:40:07,230
help with creating now we're discovering
our

653
00:40:07,230 --> 00:40:11,810
you know something and the other on the
amazingly Syria when the doc

654
00:40:11,810 --> 00:40:16,930
and move on virtually purchasing saw

655
00:40:16,930 --> 00:40:20,118
it all goes back to when I P mitchell's
usually

656
00:40:20,119 --> 00:40:23,490
use 1 but you can tell they're following

657
00:40:23,490 --> 00:40:27,140
like manufactures in did

658
00:40:27,140 --> 00:40:30,950
not said operation is d track

659
00:40:30,950 --> 00:40:33,730
and we have a pretty nice collection now
where we've collected the pass your so

660
00:40:33,730 --> 00:40:35,619
we have everything from

661
00:40:35,619 --> 00:40:39,480
malware which is designed to wiretap
asides a Skype conversation

662
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:43,210
before the outgoing is in captain after
the income is the cryptid

663
00:40:43,210 --> 00:40:47,080
we found rats we have found malware
which trees

664
00:40:47,080 --> 00:40:50,220
which tries to trace a physical location
of the server based upon the wireless

665
00:40:50,220 --> 00:40:52,690
access point and whatever else is around
it

666
00:40:52,690 --> 00:40:55,819
we've got a pretty good collection and
spends

667
00:40:55,819 --> 00:40:58,750
a long time reverse engineering it
figure out how it works we've devised a

668
00:40:58,750 --> 00:40:59,430
couple ways

669
00:40:59,430 --> 00:41:03,640
I love yeah other uninstalling it if you
think you're infected we've trained

670
00:41:03,640 --> 00:41:04,230
people

671
00:41:04,230 --> 00:41:07,350
on how to determine whether or not
they've been hit with that

672
00:41:07,350 --> 00:41:12,310
we've given people security tips on if
you if you certainly see a window for

673
00:41:12,310 --> 00:41:15,830
reason to get notification about this
our brand new zero-day in windows and

674
00:41:15,830 --> 00:41:18,359
you have to install this now

675
00:41:18,359 --> 00:41:23,119
chances are it may not be things like
that

676
00:41:23,119 --> 00:41:27,180
arrested last you know Lake in other
terms in new projects in new countries

677
00:41:27,180 --> 00:41:30,299
we just launched an opt for Sudan

678
00:41:30,300 --> 00:41:33,910
in just a couple days the Maldives which
is collection 24

679
00:41:33,910 --> 00:41:38,819
halls of the coast India any injured
Island communication

680
00:41:38,819 --> 00:41:42,200
singapore's like two beers like whatever
unthinking

681
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:47,839
QR codes in webcams and icing is with
the four thousand six pack your Cody can

682
00:41:47,839 --> 00:41:51,299
in theory do NFS with timber frames

683
00:41:51,300 --> 00:41:54,650
but yet like in a few that secures show
up

684
00:41:54,650 --> 00:41:57,930
and you know if you find collaborators
gets done

685
00:41:57,930 --> 00:42:02,100
you know you know dozen just do that
simple

686
00:42:02,100 --> 00:42:09,040
is good you know idea is to bat shit
insane

687
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:14,440
questions yeah protect questions my
computer

688
00:42:14,440 --> 00:42:21,440
gorgeous P allowed you can use to make
the better

689
00:42:33,210 --> 00:42:35,780
so John hang on a second we repeat the
question

690
00:42:35,780 --> 00:42:39,859
because at particular it was by so we
repeat the question because you know the

691
00:42:39,859 --> 00:42:41,310
mic and we'd like to be on recording

692
00:42:41,310 --> 00:42:46,509
a question was how have how effective
have toward other technologies Ben

693
00:42:46,510 --> 00:42:49,849
I actually in the field and dangerous
situation is that correct

694
00:42:49,849 --> 00:42:53,380
okay saw think this one the short answer

695
00:42:53,380 --> 00:42:56,730
storms works well people's things slow

696
00:42:56,730 --> 00:43:00,390
Lions with because they're using under
spec

697
00:43:00,390 --> 00:43:03,640
PPI here that they got resold and

698
00:43:03,640 --> 00:43:06,930
merely meant for commercial services not
for ice-t_ work

699
00:43:06,930 --> 00:43:10,089
our country there

700
00:43:10,089 --> 00:43:13,970
BP ends up begins block BB

701
00:43:13,970 --> 00:43:17,200
TP which is jurors block set lock

702
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:20,609
as a bottle particle level vices
firewalls arm

703
00:43:20,609 --> 00:43:25,290
an awesome idea your the

704
00:43:25,290 --> 00:43:29,339
other aspect is slow basically did

705
00:43:29,339 --> 00:43:32,450
if you please look much like us

706
00:43:32,450 --> 00:43:35,650
as you can it works United ran but they
do

707
00:43:35,650 --> 00:43:38,930
did you detect new things you block

708
00:43:38,930 --> 00:43:42,339
by for towards the most popular tool

709
00:43:42,339 --> 00:43:49,339
like it's there but the way to make that
faster is more notes

710
00:43:49,660 --> 00:43:53,029
part but that is true departed

711
00:43:53,030 --> 00:43:56,930
they are slowing down any to trap and
Halsted

712
00:43:56,930 --> 00:44:00,868
seem the cells and iraq's do other
things the long-term

713
00:44:00,869 --> 00:44:07,869
ir cell action if you guys have
questions please keep the mic

714
00:44:12,530 --> 00:44:14,200
yep

715
00:44:14,200 --> 00:44:19,020
word model participation one hand

716
00:44:19,020 --> 00:44:22,500
are the work you name tries

717
00:44:22,500 --> 00:44:25,630
have you had experience people's miss

718
00:44:25,630 --> 00:44:31,770
for free name adversaries I went there

719
00:44:31,770 --> 00:44:35,190
people have this is action

720
00:44:35,190 --> 00:44:38,540
people are taking weird ago

721
00:44:38,540 --> 00:44:43,470
are recruiters them

722

as miners image you're saying

723
00:44:48,380 --> 00:44:51,610

by Margie think there's red

726
00:44:59,980 --> 00:45:03,410
comment I mean honestly honestly

727
00:45:03,410 --> 00:45:07,129
biggest problem we've had along those
lines is somebody in the states using

728
00:45:07,130 --> 00:45:10,410
our name in my name personally to scam
money people

729
00:45:10,410 --> 00:45:13,430
that's why we're no money

730
00:45:13,430 --> 00:45:17,690
yet no money I'll yep everything is
donated everything is volunteered

731
00:45:17,690 --> 00:45:19,810
everything from servers to ban with two

732
00:45:19,810 --> 00:45:24,430
timed effort understand renal

733
00:45:24,430 --> 00:45:27,520

tools and I'm going on organs I'm

737
00:45:38,620 --> 00:45:41,680

lot of things

738
00:45:41,680 --> 00:45:45,100
more now side eyes where you can bring
to the table

739

yes here but my she

750
00:46:22,230 --> 00:46:25,310
really like so a lot of people are not
technical at all

751
00:46:25,310 --> 00:46:28,830
like you just need a passion for the
Internet and we will we won't tell you

you have some skill that the rest of us
don't and there is a place for it yes

755
00:46:37,570 --> 00:46:40,910
I i appreciate these answers that's
really important for everyone to know

756
00:46:40,910 --> 00:46:42,290
that it is open for

757
00:46:42,290 --> 00:46:45,360
also the skills I'm sure that there are
some

758
00:46:45,360 --> 00:46:49,620
schools that are particularly useful
from a technical perspective

759
00:46:49,620 --> 00:46:53,470
members trying to find out what they are
practically anything

760
00:46:53,470 --> 00:46:57,600
unity in we use a lot of people I'm

761
00:46:57,600 --> 00:47:00,870
it's important to have a good working
knowledge I'll

762
00:47:00,870 --> 00:47:04,370
a you know how SSL works for instance

763
00:47:04,370 --> 00:47:07,859
you know you wanna know what the with
the shrinks drawbacks

764
00:47:07,860 --> 00:47:10,880
a tools liked Warren Mixmaster

765
00:47:10,880 --> 00:47:15,750
and BP and stuff like that are but he
really good people bad advice

766
00:47:15,750 --> 00:47:19,410
but that said it's also just as useful
to know

767
00:47:19,410 --> 00:47:22,460
it you don't have to you don't have to
know a fact you just have to know who to

768
00:47:22,460 --> 00:47:23,020
ask

769
00:47:23,020 --> 00:47:27,530
and would ask is the channel and if
you're good at teaching

770
00:47:27,530 --> 00:47:30,630
if you can if you're good at taking um
body of knowledge in some kind

771
00:47:30,630 --> 00:47:33,650
and then explain it to people in a way
that they understand they can start

772
00:47:33,650 --> 00:47:34,580
applying on their own

773
00:47:34,580 --> 00:47:38,290
we need help with that too because we
only have a limited number of teachers

774
00:47:38,290 --> 00:47:41,580
hands I don't think it I think

775
00:47:41,580 --> 00:47:46,620
a given class on toward GPZ or something
tops out at about 25 to 30 people before

776
00:47:46,620 --> 00:47:47,100
the

777
00:47:47,100 --> 00:47:50,240
traffic in the channel makes it
unfeasible so

778
00:47:50,240 --> 00:47:54,880
if or even even responders 3m

779
00:47:54,880 --> 00:47:59,260
her I was keeping us do basically
72-hour

780
00:47:59,260 --> 00:48:02,610
or more should one

781
00:48:02,610 --> 00:48:05,970
was really really weird hours

782
00:48:05,970 --> 00:48:10,600
just I'm market like year-round house

783
00:48:10,600 --> 00:48:13,810
more headlines I mean we're doing said

784
00:48:13,810 --> 00:48:17,600
information people Press reopens simple
stuff

785
00:48:17,600 --> 00:48:21,380
the whole right skilled people they can
help backcheck

786
00:48:21,380 --> 00:48:24,440
like if we say you just heard this can
you hereby at

787
00:48:24,440 --> 00:48:28,650
go out get whatever information is out
there to either confirm or refute it

788
00:48:28,650 --> 00:48:33,390
get back to a caer de I'm sharing those
Mauer some

789
00:48:33,390 --> 00:48:37,339
with the anthem our industrial a few
months have been

790
00:48:37,340 --> 00:48:42,740
US have contacts there promised that can
sometimes be very

791
00:48:42,740 --> 00:48:46,780
there's Bieber's shares method

792
00:48:46,780 --> 00:48:50,850
Commons so there is a side
