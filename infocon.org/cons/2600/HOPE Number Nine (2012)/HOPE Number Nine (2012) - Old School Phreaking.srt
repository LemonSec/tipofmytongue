1
00:00:03,030 --> 00:00:03,970
get you can set up

2
00:00:03,970 --> 00:00:07,270
and this is this is really awesome it
there

3
00:00:07,270 --> 00:00:10,740
not often one gets to emcee for one's
heroes but to hear I am

4
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:13,750
the gentleman with no further ado

5
00:00:13,750 --> 00:00:18,730
because really I do Sox here's the panel
on old-school freaking may prevent

6
00:00:18,730 --> 00:00:22,240
Cheshire catalyst John Draper and Tom
Santa Monica but their car

7
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:28,339
the

8
00:00:28,339 --> 00:00:32,029
idea

9
00:00:32,029 --> 00:00:34,130
thanks very much you

10

I'm also 1970

14
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:51,860
on vintage 70s anyone actually predate
the esquire article

15
00:00:51,860 --> 00:00:57,190
by guess about nine months win I got
busy they did but I guess been going

16
00:00:57,190 --> 00:00:58,129
since the seventies

17
00:00:58,129 --> 00:01:02,250
my very favorite thing was soared
step-by-step switches specifically i

18
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:03,229
make electric

19
00:01:03,229 --> 00:01:07,500
foale's sap of sister sugar are make
told ticketing

20
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:12,240
I own bed in a serving on going about
how we can I found out about each other

21
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:12,720
how

22
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:16,710
things happen remember this is for for
the great internet explosion this is an

23
00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:17,780
internet was still

24
00:01:17,780 --> 00:01:21,110
a largely experimental thing I think
this poor connections

25
00:01:21,110 --> 00:01:25,150
between four universities and that was
it I am

26
00:01:25,150 --> 00:01:28,909
and so we didn't have facebook we didn't
have twitter we can hear me that

27
00:01:28,909 --> 00:01:33,040
but we had something else scam Bazaar
actually created for something else

28
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:39,310
it was phone company lou brown's these
are numbers that curved in pairs who

29
00:01:39,310 --> 00:01:40,930
usually consecutive

30
00:01:40,930 --> 00:01:45,600
in southern california they're usually
111 eight and 11 19 yr

31
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:49,920
and you were just dial the first number
the pair sit on

32
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:55,150
and way in Jesse who came on your side
and some people use that for dating I

33
00:01:55,150 --> 00:01:56,010
remember

34
00:01:56,010 --> 00:02:00,620
I was one in westchester the 672 line is
on there

35
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:04,940
picking me there is some free to talk to
circumstances where he

36
00:02:04,940 --> 00:02:08,419
a great sounding voice in July can see
me only means

37
00:02:08,420 --> 00:02:12,349
don't you know this is the gay line are
okay I'm really looking for technical

38
00:02:12,349 --> 00:02:13,619
information no

39
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:17,080
ransack cell I research around the way
just

40
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:22,340
kind had people out there and infected
got to be a problem that

41
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:26,180
I am I found during this dumpster diving
that the phone company was going little

42
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:27,040
bit know I'd

43
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:31,090
by this sound theory that a look at 1.04

44
00:02:31,090 --> 00:02:35,209
another race uses the circuit as a
hotline or a means to attempt to avoid

45
00:02:35,209 --> 00:02:37,550
toll charges interferes materially

46
00:02:37,550 --> 00:02:41,299
with its intended use and yes they were
fun summer those

47
00:02:41,299 --> 00:02:45,930
live around that were non supervising in
other words they look like a phone that

48
00:02:45,930 --> 00:02:48,459
had never answers he could use them

49
00:02:48,459 --> 00:02:52,749
to make free phone calls if you just re
a called up at a pre-arranged time

50
00:02:52,749 --> 00:02:56,900
to a hearing he is this thing about the
kids and how to disable it in a

51
00:02:56,900 --> 00:03:00,819
technical thing to do it and make our
request a call-back places but all you

52
00:03:00,819 --> 00:03:03,480
guys out there that we're good at social
engineering

53
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:06,760
were able to get around that so they
finally on

54
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:10,548
went to this version where the invented
the sixty

55
00:03:10,549 --> 00:03:14,819
a control unit the sixty a control unit
was a device that listens for the

56
00:03:14,819 --> 00:03:18,510
I sig frequencies other than the 1000
cycle

57
00:03:18,510 --> 00:03:22,379
know what testing town well k thats
times

58
00:03:22,379 --> 00:03:26,290
put a damper on it but let's see how
sensitive it was well if you had your

59
00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:31,439
other frequent sees or other content all
about 18 dB below the $1 Miller light

60
00:03:31,439 --> 00:03:32,099
tone

61
00:03:32,099 --> 00:03:35,749
it wouldn't activate and you can
actually talk on it and people were ham

62
00:03:35,749 --> 00:03:36,799
radio operators

63
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:39,859
were used to listening over interference
could

64
00:03:39,859 --> 00:03:43,799
here at but if you want to get you that
no it's just all and not

65
00:03:43,799 --> 00:03:46,909
dollars not shout thousand cycles and
you're good to go

66
00:03:46,909 --> 00:03:50,888
arm but anyway this is how I actually
met

67
00:03:50,889 --> 00:03:54,379
a spanish-speaking kidder at least he
pretended to be Spanish

68
00:03:54,379 --> 00:03:57,929
only speaking that said know who's
numerous

69
00:03:57,930 --> 00:04:01,260
mashy coz know does trace which I pride

70
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:04,819
killed the Spanish spoke basically
translated do you know the magic numbers

71
00:04:04,819 --> 00:04:05,939
one two and three

72
00:04:05,939 --> 00:04:10,849
nascent canal conozco numerous magic was
12 in threes old again my high school

73
00:04:10,849 --> 00:04:11,779
Spanish was much

74
00:04:11,779 --> 00:04:15,319
less rusty back then is now but bottom
line is he says you

75
00:04:15,319 --> 00:04:21,109
flash the hook switch and dial 123 and
then the routing code for your office

76
00:04:21,108 --> 00:04:25,799
you could actually the seize control
away from the director which

77
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:29,360
ordinary figured out how tall is going
around in you were in direct control

78
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:29,810
with your

79
00:04:29,810 --> 00:04:33,139
good old rotary dial telephone the

80
00:04:33,139 --> 00:04:36,510
primaries which train so anyway here's a
little

81
00:04:36,510 --> 00:04:39,510
thing I also found in the trash behind
the journal talking office

82
00:04:39,510 --> 00:04:43,630
gave you the basic call routing okay how
it normally worked

83
00:04:43,630 --> 00:04:48,080
your phone was here went connectors
distributing frames down here

84
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:53,060
operate a line in Capri airline said I
picked up my phone I want to get a dial

85
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:53,730
tone

86
00:04:53,730 --> 00:04:57,130
now it would move the a slacker are the
connector

87
00:04:57,130 --> 00:05:01,300
the line finder over connect you out in
the CAF really idk are very handsome

88
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:02,560
nothing else get

89
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:07,630
goes over here to the SAPS primary
selector which actually was through a

90
00:05:07,630 --> 00:05:09,130
director 100 cuz I

91
00:05:09,130 --> 00:05:13,270
one direction be shared because once you
got the call setup with the first three

92
00:05:13,270 --> 00:05:16,020
digits that could go away and handle
some the authors call but

93
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:20,430
you always stayed on this primary
selector for the duration of the call

94
00:05:20,430 --> 00:05:24,320
and if it was a local evers call on the
same central office when here for us

95
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:26,990
like your face like an actor dancer like
that

96
00:05:26,990 --> 00:05:31,550
if it was a call going somewhere else
the director said okay what time

97
00:05:31,550 --> 00:05:36,140
trained as a go through in in larger
offices are actually more these

98
00:05:36,140 --> 00:05:39,950
a selector switches season has had
diarrhea two codes

99
00:05:39,950 --> 00:05:42,950
the director is actually what gave you
your phone number

100
00:05:42,950 --> 00:05:46,090
however if you flashed your hooks which

101
00:05:46,090 --> 00:05:49,770
at just the right time you kicked list
little puppy of

102
00:05:49,770 --> 00:05:53,270
and you were left in direct control this

103
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:57,080
an articular was still around the Howard
the ticker instead of having the

104
00:05:57,080 --> 00:06:00,919
legitimate number stored in it they
would have won 23

105
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:06,910
I in the case hamanaka 75 in case you
are trying to get a long distance trunk

106
00:06:06,910 --> 00:06:10,030
and then you're on this like your the
repeaters going other offices and all

107
00:06:10,030 --> 00:06:13,070
that good stuff to whatever tandem unit
set up

108
00:06:13,070 --> 00:06:18,330
in Los Angeles back in Los Angeles a
1213 was a big area code and cover the

109
00:06:18,330 --> 00:06:22,570
all of los angeles county in part viacom
some other counties

110
00:06:22,570 --> 00:06:26,300
you could I'll anywhere in there with
just a rotary dial

111
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:29,360
toll-free by just flashing of getting
the gramm

112
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:32,950
downtown LA grant and then in just
rotary dial

113
00:06:32,950 --> 00:06:36,360
whole thing out obviously if you wanted
to

114
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:41,260
a make a long distance call it my way
had have a blue box for that

115
00:06:41,260 --> 00:06:44,330
the so anyway we got here

116
00:06:44,330 --> 00:06:48,390
worse that's about something action
gonna cash allow this

117
00:06:48,390 --> 00:06:54,300
Kenyan and

118
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:57,470
go will minimize that an hour

119
00:06:57,470 --> 00:07:02,620
play here for you okay how serve
step-by-step works that's kinda

120
00:07:02,620 --> 00:07:05,910
important things

121
00:07:05,910 --> 00:07:09,320
it would come out that you know demille
demos never work right when you do a

122
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:13,040
live your

123
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:20,040
okay here it comes

124
00:07:24,590 --> 00:07:28,130
the circuit is connected to contact
controlled by the telephone dial

125
00:07:28,130 --> 00:07:31,760
I would I was moved of normal what they
did

126
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:35,180
brayton Nowak take place in the birth
collector

127
00:07:35,180 --> 00:07:41,040
but I would I returned to normal but the
lecture will respond to the dial profit

128
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:44,940
it backed up to the third level

129
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:49,630
and buyer overreaction copy and
automatically to select an idle circuit

130
00:07:49,630 --> 00:07:50,380
to the neck

131
00:07:50,380 --> 00:07:56,080
selector okay this same code jumped
ahead to

132
00:07:56,080 --> 00:08:00,030
explaining I'll won the pranks that was
done during that time

133
00:08:00,030 --> 00:08:03,030
the as Santa

134
00:08:03,030 --> 00:08:06,400
Barbara nuclear emergency

135
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:10,130
and that was how a selector

136
00:08:10,130 --> 00:08:13,650
normally works lead I'll a middle digit
the number

137
00:08:13,650 --> 00:08:18,150
it goes up in this post or to the first
vacant rock we decide to

138
00:08:18,150 --> 00:08:22,780
have some fun let's do what if we hook a
whole bunch of phone lines in parallel

139
00:08:22,780 --> 00:08:24,800
you know plus the past my eyes to minus

140
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:28,290
nothing will happen cuz if they play
reason the say no current of while

141
00:08:28,290 --> 00:08:33,110
book a phone on crosses pick it up and
get like 10 dialed homes at once

142
00:08:33,110 --> 00:08:38,110
and we first thought was happen with
directory assistance and we called

143
00:08:38,110 --> 00:08:42,710
for one wine and yes as predicted we got
a whole bunch have

144
00:08:42,710 --> 00:08:46,260
directory assistance of players on the
line at the same time

145
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:49,750
and you know jack recessed instructor
assistant director said since

146
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:53,200
I what merriment I know you can have
your say you know something going wrong

147
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,090
here is a woman

148
00:08:54,090 --> 00:08:57,660
you are I reporting this now I guess
I'll do it and what stationary act 15

149
00:08:57,660 --> 00:08:58,770
arms that the only

150
00:08:58,770 --> 00:09:03,620
or hide their medieval hi there well I
was kinda amusing Solis try to do this

151
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:07,930
I other places and then we found that
with enough tries

152
00:09:07,930 --> 00:09:11,460
I just throwing things out sequence here

153
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:14,860
I'll get back to my other

154
00:09:14,860 --> 00:09:21,410
thing here with another tries and
throwing things out of sequence

155
00:09:21,410 --> 00:09:28,410
you can here's the internal wiring
diagram

156
00:09:28,890 --> 00:09:32,590
this lectern only come here here's the
bottom lines in Boulder the actual talk

157
00:09:32,590 --> 00:09:33,260
path

158
00:09:33,260 --> 00:09:37,490
what you talk on in these little symbols
here in the in the photograph

159
00:09:37,490 --> 00:09:41,130
with the lower banks up here was more
the important part the

160
00:09:41,130 --> 00:09:45,070
control leads in the extra control leads
that would either be

161
00:09:45,070 --> 00:09:48,990
if you work and follow the schematic
here would be there once it's selected

162
00:09:48,990 --> 00:09:51,270
properly with its not selected Wednesday
Ken

163
00:09:51,270 --> 00:09:54,920
it's got battery through a call relay
coil that here goes

164
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:57,990
plus for you malls and you have 1100 on
relay coil

165
00:09:57,990 --> 00:10:02,850
and that normally say that I'll when you
actually a connector got here are the

166
00:10:02,850 --> 00:10:03,510
slide thru

167
00:10:03,510 --> 00:10:06,750
got to and connected that particular on
circuit

168
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:11,490
that would ground through here and the
ground said it was busy however if

169
00:10:11,490 --> 00:10:16,500
to these landed exactly the same time
due to fees relays all out of sequence

170
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:18,500
and they will be in the right corner and
actually

171
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:22,730
leave is actually the search going back
this direction that still left you just

172
00:10:22,730 --> 00:10:23,990
hanging on the line

173
00:10:23,990 --> 00:10:27,770
some the relays down here in the proper
order so didn't give what's called a

174
00:10:27,770 --> 00:10:31,290
permanent signal to the central office
they had no idea anything was wrong

175
00:10:31,290 --> 00:10:34,329
but this was still shown as being and
I'll circuit

176
00:10:34,330 --> 00:10:38,270
and if you're fortunate enough that you
were Khan won the first levels to step

177
00:10:38,270 --> 00:10:38,750
over

178
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:42,700
you would get a lot cause I later
calculate baby had a one-out

179
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:45,860
cheered 10% chance appears Sep 10 calls
but

180
00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:50,150
it a lot people who happen to be calling
for that area for a particular reason

181
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:53,480
you got one on the 10 cause not many
people would drop in the

182
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:58,570
when was happening cell the prankster
involve the size they always make up

183
00:10:58,570 --> 00:11:00,170
some kinda ridiculous like

184
00:11:00,170 --> 00:11:04,030
okay the say there's a nuclear emergency
because this is Sam bar they did too

185
00:11:04,030 --> 00:11:05,459
because they had this all the Quitman

186
00:11:05,460 --> 00:11:10,960
to it antique figured most people think
its process because the at that time the

187
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:14,930
nearest atomic power plant was down in
San 00 freak I bet distance from Santa

188
00:11:14,930 --> 00:11:15,420
Barbara

189
00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:19,640
so anyway the year they said oh you know
we must keep these lines clear for

190
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:20,830
emergency use

191
00:11:20,830 --> 00:11:24,910
please I get off the line and he only
did that for a while Manuel

192
00:11:24,910 --> 00:11:29,640
some funny things start happening I law
enforcement an official government

193
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:33,170
agency starting econ that lie decide
what happened what this is not a good

194
00:11:33,170 --> 00:11:33,880
idea they

195
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:37,350
the banks is this I will this not stick
around dropped the connection a course

196
00:11:37,350 --> 00:11:40,630
merely once you drop the search released
everything in a whole system is back to

197
00:11:40,630 --> 00:11:41,410
normal again

198
00:11:41,410 --> 00:11:46,150
well the event made the LA Times the
next day in the AP wire service about

199
00:11:46,150 --> 00:11:49,839
the nuclear bomb mostly because the
phone come user who is we had no idea

200
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:51,720
what went wrong with that

201
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:55,170
and by is seen to clear itself up so I
guess we're not worry about

202
00:11:55,170 --> 00:11:58,189
well we just gave you a reason why

203
00:11:58,190 --> 00:12:02,640
and that happened and how much time

204
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:06,880
or what and and good luck with that

205
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:10,890
gun more time picture looking for old
stories

206
00:12:10,890 --> 00:12:17,890
was a fine

207
00:12:18,470 --> 00:12:22,260
I didn't come until after the esquire
article that's what got me involved

208
00:12:22,260 --> 00:12:25,610
well of course before that I was doing
things like wasn't a loop some

209
00:12:25,610 --> 00:12:28,880
talk between the B-two the busy signal
the kind things kids did

210
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:32,370
becoming interested in the telephone
network so I looked into a little

211
00:12:32,370 --> 00:12:32,930
further

212
00:12:32,930 --> 00:12:36,450
than most kids but really was after he
as per article

213
00:12:36,450 --> 00:12:39,800
I'm really got involved and I came in

214
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:44,910
around 1969 I was expecting around with
an FM transmitter

215
00:12:44,910 --> 00:12:49,230
and hours into antenna design

216
00:12:49,230 --> 00:12:52,510
and i hook up the transmitter

217
00:12:52,510 --> 00:12:57,089
plates and pates an audio and I went out
driving around see how far the antenna

218
00:12:57,089 --> 00:12:58,029
with pic you know

219
00:12:58,029 --> 00:13:03,680
send the signal and I get back home then
I said anybody here this place called

220
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:07,170
2648 773 in sure enough I got a call

221
00:13:07,170 --> 00:13:11,620
happened to beat denny but the guy gave
me a look around number

222
00:13:11,620 --> 00:13:16,500
a in in this as an area that was 00 44
in 0045

223
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:20,820
so he gave me the 44 side of the loop
and I call the 44 sidon

224
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:24,820
because I wanted to get another single
check from the men I got that loud town

225
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:28,420
call the phone company at that I said
hey I think ASM something wrong with

226
00:13:28,420 --> 00:13:29,050
this number

227
00:13:29,050 --> 00:13:32,790
and alchemy says well this is a special
internal number how'd you get it

228
00:13:32,790 --> 00:13:36,730
I'll this guy gave it to me and the fam
hung up

229
00:13:36,730 --> 00:13:40,110
when he called me back a but two weeks
later

230
00:13:40,110 --> 00:13:43,450
because is that he's got like
photographic memory any rumors in the

231
00:13:43,450 --> 00:13:44,850
break to quit remember

232
00:13:44,850 --> 00:13:48,930
who the number went to so I said yeah
I'm the guy did the FM transmitter

233
00:13:48,930 --> 00:13:51,420
remember in this is witness to the
number you gave me

234
00:13:51,420 --> 00:13:55,470
he said i little brown number what's any
Terry explaining what it was

235
00:13:55,470 --> 00:13:58,990
and I said Wow okay that's cool can you
make free calls

236
00:13:58,990 --> 00:14:02,860
and the Aces yeah how's that working on
trying to find another demonstrator

237
00:14:02,860 --> 00:14:03,449
number

238
00:14:03,449 --> 00:14:07,110
back and second day there was Jess just
getting

239
00:14:07,110 --> 00:14:10,920
a touchtone service salt I'll I'll post
back then

240
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:14,940
and sour week called a demonstrator
number

241
00:14:14,940 --> 00:14:18,329
give a touch-tone dial tone and you
could touch tone of that

242
00:14:18,329 --> 00:14:21,440
local numbers low call sometimes they
would forget and

243
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:25,230
been up so you can actually make long
distance calls on course he wouldn't be

244
00:14:25,230 --> 00:14:27,680
able to do that too much for their going
to detect it pretty quickly

245
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:31,540
so I went up to visit him and I

246
00:14:31,540 --> 00:14:35,709
going this ago knocking on the door
bother answer dices

247
00:14:35,709 --> 00:14:39,100
any there gave his room go to is Roman

248
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:42,850
totally dark and says hey can turn on
lights

249
00:14:42,850 --> 00:14:47,230
ago everybody was blind it'll need light
so I

250
00:14:47,230 --> 00:14:51,209
I got a little careful love
demonstration over Jimmy

251
00:14:51,209 --> 00:14:54,670
Jim that gathers is real name and Jimmy

252
00:14:54,670 --> 00:14:57,870
basically hammered out some

253
00:14:57,870 --> 00:15:02,060
multi-frequency tones on his organ and
says years which do you call this eight

254
00:15:02,060 --> 00:15:02,690
hundred-number

255
00:15:02,690 --> 00:15:05,740
the Senate 26 enter big book The Captain
Crunch whistle

256
00:15:05,740 --> 00:15:10,029
then west call the Captain Crunch
leslie's is just a whistle to them

257
00:15:10,029 --> 00:15:13,170
was in later on tell me that call the
captain Graeme Smith

258
00:15:13,170 --> 00:15:16,180
so he whistled

259
00:15:16,180 --> 00:15:19,819
the the 800 number of going could King

260
00:15:19,819 --> 00:15:23,319
and you could end just dial people
sirico dimmer star

261
00:15:23,319 --> 00:15:26,680
and it went through islamic that is this

262
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:30,850
not can't be that easy so I went home in

263
00:15:30,850 --> 00:15:33,850
built my first blue box it was a a it
was aids

264
00:15:33,850 --> 00:15:38,079
six button box I had to push to buns at
a time

265
00:15:38,079 --> 00:15:42,709
to make them tones and our I kinda do a
little diagram on the box there

266
00:15:42,709 --> 00:15:46,770
I didn't have enough does that make it
down matrix but the next couple days I

267
00:15:46,770 --> 00:15:47,189
did

268
00:15:47,190 --> 00:15:51,300
but just to play around with the
actually you know prove a performance as

269
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:53,300
running back and forth between the piano
in a

270
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:56,100
thing that make sure I get to rate
frequencies went into the keys of the

271
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:56,630
piano

272
00:15:56,630 --> 00:16:00,819
and turn up at work I oh my god this is
crazy happen it worked at

273
00:16:00,819 --> 00:16:04,920
easy so things going on I certainly more
more experimenting with it

274
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:08,600
in started learning the area the OCC
code

275
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:13,360
other common carriers and these causing
042

276
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:16,690
and all four whatever and

277
00:16:16,690 --> 00:16:20,740
I have a little bit about them out that
I can play later Bobby ready with your

278
00:16:20,740 --> 00:16:21,399
stuff them

279
00:16:21,399 --> 00:16:25,350
okay we're going go back here well
you're a showed you the

280
00:16:25,350 --> 00:16:29,730
diagram of what we did because actually
know a fee I kinda figured you know

281
00:16:29,730 --> 00:16:33,550
using knocking off an eight hundred
number by western of the house safely

282
00:16:33,550 --> 00:16:37,220
did figured that was really to save
because back in that day

283
00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:41,670
800 numbers are primarily made make
hotel reservations in need get little

284
00:16:41,670 --> 00:16:45,079
suspicious about a half hour call to
make a hotel reservation

285
00:16:45,079 --> 00:16:50,800
so with the 53 director exploit and
throwing realize our sequence in getting

286
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:52,270
this new kid on

287
00:16:52,270 --> 00:16:55,870
use a different way to get on the tandem
but on

288
00:16:55,870 --> 00:17:01,939
anyway I gotta say audio sample what
that sounded like to do that here

289
00:17:01,939 --> 00:17:05,879
ga for soldiers to place what I call
normally sounded like i general

290
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:08,059
telephone office now on this recording

291
00:17:08,059 --> 00:17:12,599
I just had bridge to cross the line with
a capacitor and my audio system

292
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:16,909
so you hear the dial holtz's really loud
on but the important thing here's

293
00:17:16,909 --> 00:17:20,480
list do is this

294
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:24,909
for now you know is there's two clicks
right there clunk clunk

295
00:17:24,909 --> 00:17:28,309
who it's between those two clocks that
you

296
00:17:28,309 --> 00:17:33,270
I am flash they look so it's just right
and knew you got it right by instead the

297
00:17:33,270 --> 00:17:35,059
second clunk

298
00:17:35,059 --> 00:17:38,450
I and then the dial tone it just went
smooth and do it out on the here's how

299
00:17:38,450 --> 00:17:40,250
the rest the caller

300
00:17:40,250 --> 00:17:44,860
you do it again for

301
00:17:44,860 --> 00:17:50,500
to want that

302
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:53,840
okay that bubbling sound particular it

303
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:57,919
that's the now here's my doing diner
niner neier niner

304
00:17:57,920 --> 00:18:04,920
them good okay essences owns the
repeater now here's the repeater

305
00:18:04,950 --> 00:18:06,300
repeating those polls

306
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:13,070
key key K cuddle

307
00:18:13,070 --> 00:18:18,970
and there's the phone at the other end
finally ringing okay

308
00:18:18,970 --> 00:18:24,500
I am then here's a variant a call that
used in math in for par the call and

309
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:27,540
I'll parts for par the call so open that
file

310
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:34,540
here immense trunk

311
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:40,279
okay this one actually when I actually
be decide to record in bring the whole

312
00:18:40,279 --> 00:18:41,830
recording is a bore you to tears

313
00:18:41,830 --> 00:18:45,168
I recorded the call progress from every
two

314
00:18:45,169 --> 00:18:49,370
every sperm prefix they could I'll from
the

315
00:18:49,370 --> 00:18:53,480
394 central office the 213 area code to
hear what they all sound like in some

316
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:53,860
other

317
00:18:53,860 --> 00:18:56,919
bring progress tones are kinda
interesting but that's more for almost a

318
00:18:56,919 --> 00:18:59,370
telephone collectors meeting that a
hacker meeting

319
00:18:59,370 --> 00:19:03,360
on the ball changing wringing machine
that sounds like a burning sounding like

320
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:05,890
that anyway here's now an example the
call

321
00:19:05,890 --> 00:19:10,250
where the last the edges are in math on
actually I have set up just to hear the

322
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:11,309
NF right now

323
00:19:11,309 --> 00:19:15,820
could could

324
00:19:15,820 --> 00:19:19,059
so I don't know you I know hong emailing
her whole heart

325
00:19:19,059 --> 00:19:26,059
yeah okay lying on the whole cost less
go to a select all

326
00:19:30,350 --> 00:19:32,880
alright here's the whole call from the
game to face but you'll hear the

327
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:34,700
individual pulses you this year the

328
00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:38,710
make and break up the on contacts cross
the earpiece but still the same idea

329
00:19:38,710 --> 00:19:42,660
first three digits I paused late last
year the grinding in banging from the

330
00:19:42,660 --> 00:19:43,740
office as the

331
00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:46,780
this one was not hacked her freak this
is Justin the

332
00:19:46,780 --> 00:19:51,530
the normal call actually used to map it
out boom

333
00:19:51,530 --> 00:19:57,889
%uh them

334
00:19:57,890 --> 00:20:04,890
it

335
00:20:07,250 --> 00:20:07,530
%uh

336
00:20:07,530 --> 00:20:14,530
skin

337
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:21,870
and that's it unites a few noticed you
know is four digits but there you heard

338
00:20:21,870 --> 00:20:24,330
six towns the first one was KP

339
00:20:24,330 --> 00:20:30,179
I KP then 9999 and then start in app so
that's how that office work

340
00:20:30,180 --> 00:20:36,780
KPS eleven hundred plus a 1700 and start
is 1500 plus

341
00:20:36,780 --> 00:20:40,920
1700 hurts you have to do the key posts
first

342
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:45,150
and then you dial the number and then
did start to the reason why he had to do

343
00:20:45,150 --> 00:20:45,680
that

344
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:48,920
with because these tenants had to be all
that except

345
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:52,490
I many different kinds of numbers at
three digit numbers

346
00:20:52,490 --> 00:20:55,760
six digit numbers seven digit numbers in
10 digit numbers

347
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:58,950
where

348
00:20:58,950 --> 00:21:04,259
years

349
00:21:04,259 --> 00:21:05,359
and

350
00:21:05,359 --> 00:21:09,139
other see what else do we have that
that's about it I

351
00:21:09,139 --> 00:21:12,010
the ink in less

352
00:21:12,010 --> 00:21:17,180
else here all well my first blue boxes
get show you a picture that thank you

353
00:21:17,180 --> 00:21:20,430
and it was nearly out of our

354
00:21:20,430 --> 00:21:24,740
all against John's first actually this
is actually not my first one they have

355
00:21:24,740 --> 00:21:28,630
I didn't have a picture my first one
actually this is part and the first one

356
00:21:28,630 --> 00:21:32,080
original 1i built with vacuum tubes

357
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:36,929
specifically a bunch of 6s in seven back
into they had my junk box

358
00:21:36,930 --> 00:21:41,770
my first the temp was with an L CIO at
an RC oscillator wean bridge type thing

359
00:21:41,770 --> 00:21:43,930
that wasn't too stable cuz things would
drift in

360
00:21:43,930 --> 00:21:47,020
of frequency you might wonder how I
calibrated this thing

361
00:21:47,020 --> 00:21:51,030
because they didn't have access to a
frequency counter back the end however

362
00:21:51,030 --> 00:21:57,030
there is a handy government sponsored
frequencies on 2.5 5 10

363
00:21:57,030 --> 00:22:00,770
in 20 megahertz New Moon mainly thinking
that as far as RF

364
00:22:00,770 --> 00:22:04,370
down the audio transmission they also
played 44 E

365
00:22:04,370 --> 00:22:10,720
a cycle towns in six hundred cycle towns
600 cycles is even here you had your job

366
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:11,140
did

367
00:22:11,140 --> 00:22:14,630
integer divisions into you know these
seven hundred nine hundred eleven

368
00:22:14,630 --> 00:22:18,470
hundred all the inept own so an
oscilloscope in this issue patterns and

369
00:22:18,470 --> 00:22:20,190
that's how I tuned up my blue box

370
00:22:20,190 --> 00:22:25,330
so the first thing was like youjizz like
that by that he carried around a

371
00:22:25,330 --> 00:22:29,710
cardboard box at a plug in the lawsuit
thing very well he's in the pay phone so

372
00:22:29,710 --> 00:22:33,820
that lasted the way for you to use the
control box for that generation iPhone a

373
00:22:33,820 --> 00:22:35,760
compacted they found some transistors

374
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:40,260
some 88 million retail or I'd say an LC
oscillator which is more stable on this

375
00:22:40,260 --> 00:22:40,620
is

376
00:22:40,620 --> 00:22:44,370
the exterior view is still kinda big and
clunky here's a quarter here for

377
00:22:44,370 --> 00:22:45,170
reference

378
00:22:45,170 --> 00:22:48,460
bottom and here's the inside view ovett

379
00:22:48,460 --> 00:22:51,660
and tuning it up involved just

380
00:22:51,660 --> 00:22:55,430
getting a budget capacitors in parallel
with the I didn't feel like peeling

381
00:22:55,430 --> 00:22:58,850
on white wires of the car I'd sell I
just to prevent

382
00:22:58,850 --> 00:23:02,960
pastors in parallel until was on Fri
concealment tell pretty well as pretty

383
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:04,670
good cash and take your phone booth

384
00:23:04,670 --> 00:23:10,190
play with this thing so that was my
first toolbox your mind was a

385
00:23:10,190 --> 00:23:14,980
mine was a a digital blue box I use and
digital circuitry to

386
00:23:14,980 --> 00:23:18,640
the switch in the dow matrix what I had
a had a cherry switch

387
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:22,360
and unfortunately and I have a picture
at the you've basically got these all

388
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:25,660
slide switches to go up and down from
zero all the way up to

389
00:23:25,660 --> 00:23:31,390
to nine and then output 1 flights with
together into one the other one to three

390
00:23:31,390 --> 00:23:34,830
and another in 25 5512 12

391
00:23:34,830 --> 00:23:38,629
an automatically inject the keep Austin
St at actually

392
00:23:38,630 --> 00:23:43,610
I be the one start there yet times
cited: to keep of town and

393
00:23:43,610 --> 00:23:49,040
just had the other talent ago did it
very fast exactly and precisely that

394
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:52,780
the duty cycle the phone company
couldn't switch would really have so

395
00:23:52,780 --> 00:23:56,120
this with really stealthy because he
really couldn't tell the difference

396
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:56,650
between

397
00:23:56,650 --> 00:24:00,930
it and the actual telephone company
equipment because we were expecting

398
00:24:00,930 --> 00:24:04,100
them to be putting in newer equipment
and

399
00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:08,290
we wanted to make sure we had everything
correct and so that's what I did

400
00:24:08,290 --> 00:24:11,560
and ass had to add one more thing I had
ever 3202 hurts

401
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:15,210
oscillator I with a variable %ah

402
00:24:15,210 --> 00:24:19,890
variable amplitude control that I used
for guard banding

403
00:24:19,890 --> 00:24:23,530
gardening is a wicket meet a little bit
about gardening

404
00:24:23,530 --> 00:24:29,360
that betting is when you have another
frequency be sites 2600 are present on

405
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:30,320
the phone line

406
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:33,480
you don't want to drop off why because
Aunt Jemima

407
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:36,480
Voice might have a lot of 26 at compound
&

408
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:39,550
and when she screams and yells and drop
her off the car

409
00:24:39,550 --> 00:24:43,370
so we don't want that so they had some
kinda with guard banning order

410
00:24:43,370 --> 00:24:44,710
preventing a

411
00:24:44,710 --> 00:24:48,400
the that 2600 from going off the line so
what we did

412
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:51,650
with mild weather we picked 3200 3200 is

413
00:24:51,650 --> 00:24:55,630
just slightly outside at the frequency
range the normal telephone

414
00:24:55,630 --> 00:25:01,930
which is 300 to 3,000 that's that's
kinda like the main frequency range

415
00:25:01,930 --> 00:25:05,890
and just above 3,000 I think it up to
3200

416
00:25:05,890 --> 00:25:10,240
and we did very the freaks you will be
get it just right so what we did was

417
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:13,330
we call a number we tweak it off

418
00:25:13,330 --> 00:25:19,050
and then we put the 3200 on their and
the 26 area and nothing happened we

419
00:25:19,050 --> 00:25:22,710
not touched down a little bit more
nothing happened all set to go

420
00:25:22,710 --> 00:25:26,840
keep be good teaching we could do little
to jinx so therefore we were able to

421
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:27,510
guard band

422
00:25:27,510 --> 00:25:30,950
now Qurbani works anywhere it doesn't
work on the Merc

423
00:25:30,950 --> 00:25:34,040
I mean number one cross part Canon
stacking

424
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:37,200
and a by one to get that thing set up
okay I

425
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:41,110
number one cross Park and are tendons
which are

426
00:25:41,110 --> 00:25:44,410
basically stackable without actually
using guard

427
00:25:44,410 --> 00:25:48,520
and the way that worked years you do the
key pulse

428
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:51,530
and 042 start and

429
00:25:51,530 --> 00:25:55,170
that wouldn't drop you into the 042
trunk but since there's nothing offered

430
00:25:55,170 --> 00:25:55,880
to dial

431
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:58,960
it just drops UN went for a scan a
second ca

432
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:03,370
first at get out that this tape a strip

433
00:26:03,370 --> 00:26:08,690
at this table recorded by at doorbell
and I tried very hard it doorbell appear

434
00:26:08,690 --> 00:26:15,320
to this conference but to in the how to
reach him so

435
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:22,320
this dialing a number the number that's
ringing at this point doesn't matter

436
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:33,680
what's important is that this call has
gone over a trunk from New York to a

437
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:34,800
distant 48

438
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:40,330
which can be reset by 2600

439
00:26:40,330 --> 00:26:44,379
K that's the supervision handshake

440
00:26:44,380 --> 00:26:48,289
of book on that a okay you like India

441
00:26:48,289 --> 00:26:52,010
times well here once again

442
00:26:52,010 --> 00:26:59,010
Mar

443
00:27:03,730 --> 00:27:05,950
the number that's ringing at this point
doesn't matter

444
00:27:05,950 --> 00:27:09,679
what's important is that this call has
gone over a trunk from New York to a

445
00:27:09,679 --> 00:27:10,799
distant 48

446
00:27:10,799 --> 00:27:16,330
which can be reset by 2600

447
00:27:16,330 --> 00:27:20,429
K it's the that's the supervision
handshake

448
00:27:20,430 --> 00:27:23,610
of book on look and now it's waiting for
new digits

449
00:27:23,610 --> 00:27:29,700
which been will supply for stopping the
tape now

450
00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:33,110
what he dialed was 216 054

451
00:27:33,110 --> 00:27:36,580
064 these are all the ruling goes

452
00:27:36,580 --> 00:27:40,530
the network in the nineteen seventies
had routing codes for

453
00:27:40,530 --> 00:27:45,430
tendons in all major cities the first
code 216

454
00:27:45,430 --> 00:27:48,870
054 is the routing code for Youngstown
Ohio

455
00:27:48,870 --> 00:27:52,310
be 064 in be

456
00:27:52,310 --> 00:27:55,480
area code up to 16 is the ruling code
for Canton

457
00:27:55,480 --> 00:28:00,830
Ohio both of these across part and inns
when then he's in the sequence

458
00:28:00,830 --> 00:28:04,740
before a into which he is key picks up
the trunk to

459
00:28:04,740 --> 00:28:08,220
Youngstown Ohio and sends 064

460
00:28:08,220 --> 00:28:13,550
that tick is the for a cutting through
to Youngstown Ohio after having sent

461
00:28:13,550 --> 00:28:16,600
064 now what does Youngstown

462
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:20,470
do with the 064 well it picks up the
truck to Canton

463
00:28:20,470 --> 00:28:23,580
that's the code for Canton but having
been sent

464
00:28:23,580 --> 00:28:27,480
only the routing code and no digits to
follow it it's simply

465
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:31,970
dumpsters into the Canton trunk without
sending anything in other words

466
00:28:31,970 --> 00:28:38,290
its tax that's the sound at Youngstown
Ohio dumping it into a truck to Canton

467
00:28:38,290 --> 00:28:43,629
all and that's the handshake from Canton
Canton Ohio

468
00:28:43,630 --> 00:28:50,630
is now ready to receive digits for thats
054

469
00:28:50,940 --> 00:28:55,280
064 this causes can to pick up the trunk
to Youngstown and send

470
00:28:55,280 --> 00:29:00,090
064 now we're in Youngstown again which

471
00:29:00,090 --> 00:29:03,110
stacks into Canton and then Canton

472
00:29:03,110 --> 00:29:08,740
Paul gives us the NC and we'll do
another 05 4064

473
00:29:08,740 --> 00:29:13,470
for now read Youngstown again

474
00:29:13,470 --> 00:29:17,650
Youngstown stacks to Canton iPad

475
00:29:17,650 --> 00:29:23,960
that's the handshake and here we go
again for where he brings back old

476
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:25,420
memories just down here

477
00:29:25,420 --> 00:29:29,210
Canton me back and sick

478
00:29:29,210 --> 00:29:34,830
for now the connection has gotten so
long that the handshake is all you can

479
00:29:34,830 --> 00:29:35,199
hear

480
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:40,560
I me now on that supervision class you

I

483
00:29:50,410 --> 00:29:54,570
that was such a short place that you
didn't get to hear all the on hooks

484
00:29:54,570 --> 00:30:01,570
for you've been listening to the
beginning at the original 1975 take

485
00:30:01,710 --> 00:30:04,940
stretched to allow me to describe what's

I'm

488
00:30:11,470 --> 00:30:15,050

489
00:30:15,050 --> 00:30:15,740
using in

490
00:30:15,740 --> 00:30:19,840
and despairing up the TTC goes back and
forth back and forth back and forth

491
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:23,070
and that was how you are able to stack
tandems

and a good number two okay I'm now in
this next

let go soft little bit

533
00:33:45,060 --> 00:33:48,389
I guess we should describe what he means
by price for it I guess the proper term

534
00:33:48,390 --> 00:33:49,550
is written for

535
00:33:49,550 --> 00:33:53,129
normally that's what they call yes which
it to send a short burst

536
00:33:53,130 --> 00:33:56,500
2600 at Boise always build role told him
so they'd

537
00:33:56,500 --> 00:33:59,750
and want to repeat the signal along the
way

538
00:33:59,750 --> 00:34:04,520
makes a wonderful now in the actual
network the ring forward was used for a

539
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:07,780
to sing one operator the put up a
connection

540
00:34:07,780 --> 00:34:11,739
and that was also you have to be worked
out of our the you know operator

541
00:34:11,740 --> 00:34:15,929
Chris scramble which would send a little
chirp 2610 you going on

542
00:34:15,929 --> 00:34:19,149
on now to verify and Apple I'm flash

543
00:34:19,149 --> 00:34:23,000
connection and when you get a connection
this long and you bring forward assuming

544
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,480
that it passes it along which this one
does

545
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:28,620
on your you get to hear that that little
first the

546
00:34:28,620 --> 00:34:32,100
forward on said you notice very slowly
one

547
00:34:32,100 --> 00:34:35,649
next semester next call amps cascading
down

548
00:34:35,649 --> 00:34:39,460
count the ways and he goes there with
the tape recorder on

549
00:34:39,460 --> 00:34:44,830
no first on the call in line home I'm

550
00:34:44,830 --> 00:34:51,830
pink

551
00:34:51,859 --> 00:34:57,670
by for idk

552
00:34:57,670 --> 00:35:00,710
so each truck is kinda doing it became a
thing

553
00:35:00,710 --> 00:35:03,850
acknowledging that fast forward replying
and

554
00:35:03,850 --> 00:35:10,330
from transmitting along it's a little
casually ask

555
00:35:10,330 --> 00:35:14,430
and wait for you to hang out

556
00:35:14,430 --> 00:35:18,330
but that ok

557
00:35:18,330 --> 00:35:25,330

00:38:36,460 --> 00:38:40,140
and I got through and heard the tell
jurors recording and then I placed my

608
00:38:40,140 --> 00:38:41,379
third call

609
00:38:41,380 --> 00:38:45,440
291 0 555

610
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:50,280
1212 in those days 910 was not a love on
a rico

611
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:53,760
as would so-called a special area code
no se si

612
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:57,030
for the Twix teletype network TWX

613
00:38:57,030 --> 00:39:00,830
teletype writer exchange i dial that

614
00:39:00,830 --> 00:39:05,130
the way raining click

615
00:39:05,130 --> 00:39:08,280
modem town and that's when I knew

616
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:11,510
AT&T adlai

617
00:39:11,510 --> 00:39:14,730
because they said the talks told him
that work was in no way interconnect

618
00:39:14,730 --> 00:39:17,100
with the telephone network of course not

619
00:39:17,100 --> 00:39:20,790
it they lied it was arm

620
00:39:20,790 --> 00:39:24,660
as so that meant that I could use the
love teletype machine that office in

621
00:39:24,660 --> 00:39:28,190
downtown Rochester to reach the time for
existing not Brockport

622
00:39:28,190 --> 00:39:32,290
was very expensive sure is a really he's
immune are to go to a different college

623
00:39:32,290 --> 00:39:37,460
user dialup moans what have you but I
learned about the Twix halted network

624
00:39:37,460 --> 00:39:41,540
and I found out the though they were
other exchanged other cities

625
00:39:41,540 --> 00:39:46,130
that the twig special area code and
exchange is would translate to

626
00:39:46,130 --> 00:39:49,170
because there I was in rochester man why
with the

627
00:39:49,170 --> 00:39:52,670
the cheapskates address or telephone
company put a whole new telephone

628
00:39:52,670 --> 00:39:54,780
exchange for a possible place while

629
00:39:54,780 --> 00:39:57,810
and that's why after they would
translate the numbers

630
00:39:57,810 --> 00:40:01,650
so I've had a lil about forty cities I
could record dealt with machines in

631
00:40:01,650 --> 00:40:02,150
which

632
00:40:02,150 --> 00:40:05,980
it was fairly useless but when the city
was New York

633
00:40:05,980 --> 00:40:09,930
never moved to New York art you know
whenever he had a press release to send

634
00:40:09,930 --> 00:40:10,799
I would just

635
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:15,410
dial up both the job %uh 2x machine at
though the AP

636
00:40:15,410 --> 00:40:19,580
for the PI in San the my press release
in the moon got published

637
00:40:19,580 --> 00:40:23,330
I am the international record carriers

638
00:40:23,330 --> 00:40:27,069
RZ global communications i gt worldcom
all head

639
00:40:27,070 --> 00:40:30,740
art which numbers you could dial and
they would you speak in code conversion

640
00:40:30,740 --> 00:40:34,280
from 110 bought ASCII on the 2x side

641
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:38,109
to 75 blog Bordeaux on the telex I'd

642
00:40:38,109 --> 00:40:41,890
to reach and telex machine outside North
America so I could

643
00:40:41,890 --> 00:40:45,509
send messages lmao %um hi this is %uh

644
00:40:45,510 --> 00:40:49,280
treasure computer hacker New York
position is sometimes a chat

645
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:53,690
well the offer that didn't go very far
but then they put up Marissa

646
00:40:53,690 --> 00:40:57,750
the maritime communications satellite
and i got to lose the vote ship

647
00:40:57,750 --> 00:41:00,960
telex numbers in all probably will work
information

648
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:04,000
arm so I dialed up bush a random ship

649
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:08,220
hides the Cheshire computer hacking your
cousin have times Jan out there

650
00:41:08,220 --> 00:41:12,470
I am now reaching a ship's radio officer
hundreds of miles at sea

651
00:41:12,470 --> 00:41:15,940
absolutely nothing to do but certain
chat especially

652
00:41:15,940 --> 00:41:22,940
on someone else's nickel

653
00:41:24,190 --> 00:41:28,570
flow I would be chatting away but this
was brand new to those guys

654
00:41:28,570 --> 00:41:32,580
and you know they were out at sea didn't
have a are access to all the available

655
00:41:32,580 --> 00:41:37,819
information literature a good questions
like RCA sent me these unique codes for

656
00:41:37,820 --> 00:41:41,359
me to get my head office and i cant
figure out how to use these damn things

657
00:41:41,359 --> 00:41:45,470
well mom please and all MPLS difficult
what's revision for

658
00:41:45,470 --> 00:41:48,810
would and I look up the earthly brochure
0

659
00:41:48,810 --> 00:41:52,799
take the carrier ID thumb wheel internet
22 for RCA

660
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:55,940
and then your one plus we'll get right
back to head office

661
00:41:55,940 --> 00:41:59,260
well course the helpful salesman had
separate them to

662
00:41:59,260 --> 00:42:02,710
carrier ID to enter the bill would never
change it

663
00:42:02,710 --> 00:42:06,460
mine and guys think it back to one for
contact general he had a problem use the

664
00:42:06,460 --> 00:42:07,839
one place

665
00:42:07,839 --> 00:42:11,630
so I always imagined he backed the
earlier the mirrors that

666
00:42:11,630 --> 00:42:15,030
they weren't sure how reliable the the
satellite was

667
00:42:15,030 --> 00:42:20,540
so we can match a I always imagine a day
when the except report was printed out

668
00:42:20,540 --> 00:42:24,609
with the answer back they didn't know
how the bill busy every telex machine

669
00:42:24,609 --> 00:42:25,900
every twitch machine had

670
00:42:25,900 --> 00:42:29,300
an answer back hardcoded into the
machine well

671
00:42:29,300 --> 00:42:33,390
I was calling from ATM 3 video terminal
so I didn't have an answer back

672
00:42:33,390 --> 00:42:36,390
but I had to type 1&2 that the computers
up like

673
00:42:36,390 --> 00:42:39,390
was a real 2x machine well the

674
00:42:39,390 --> 00:42:43,060
I use the maximum number of characters
14 characters in my answer back which

675
00:42:43,060 --> 00:42:43,400
was

676
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:46,630
T WX space border are

677
00:42:46,630 --> 00:42:50,800
the number for space pH are EA KS

678
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:55,620
Twix are four freaks I

679
00:42:55,620 --> 00:43:00,560
ID I always imagine that except report

680
00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:03,950
hit the desk up whoever was looking at
my

681
00:43:03,950 --> 00:43:07,990
all good grief somebody bring it works
our system the winners have mustered all

682
00:43:07,990 --> 00:43:09,180
the killing on quick

683
00:43:09,180 --> 00:43:12,720
pull the mag tapes and they would send
someone you know to the State Library

684
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:13,640
he'd pull the

685
00:43:13,640 --> 00:43:17,060
mackey draw upon the tape drive run out
the printer

686
00:43:17,060 --> 00:43:21,380
but the printout he's breaking her
season three of the hell

687
00:43:21,380 --> 00:43:26,350
and he's being friendly they they never
could figure me out

688
00:43:26,350 --> 00:43:30,490
because im like both freaks in hackers I
was exploring the network

689
00:43:30,490 --> 00:43:33,530
you know just trying to figure out what
I could do with it which really wasn't

690
00:43:33,530 --> 00:43:34,089
much

691
00:43:34,089 --> 00:43:37,630
you that these business machines in
people weren't that friendly out there

692
00:43:37,630 --> 00:43:38,050
they were

693
00:43:38,050 --> 00:43:42,350
businesspeople arm and that they weren't
playing with these things they use them

694
00:43:42,350 --> 00:43:43,290
for business

695
00:43:43,290 --> 00:43:46,320
me I was a freak I was playing with it

696
00:43:46,320 --> 00:43:49,730
in also in the tax code like 01

697
00:43:49,730 --> 00:43:54,000
like 710 in the bay if you do all 17

698
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:57,570
555 1212 I

699
00:43:57,570 --> 00:44:01,520
then you get the other side hmm and

700
00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:05,180
so what I did was like when I wanted to
make a call

701
00:44:05,180 --> 00:44:08,220
like on a pay phone there was no

702
00:44:08,220 --> 00:44:12,530
you couldn't die out direct 800 numbers
yet did go to an operator

703
00:44:12,530 --> 00:44:16,010
so I would and just about the time
you're ready to bang out the number the

704
00:44:16,010 --> 00:44:18,490
operator comes on like that that went
back shows

705
00:44:18,490 --> 00:44:21,630
the call on the other end just hung up

706
00:44:21,630 --> 00:44:25,520
so what I tell the operator I see
operator wanna play today to call

707
00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:28,700
please ignore of supervision

708
00:44:28,700 --> 00:44:33,040
and so that just gave me just a little
bit more time to bang out the

709
00:44:33,040 --> 00:44:36,290
the 017 a

710
00:44:36,290 --> 00:44:39,540
12 want anything start and go to any

711
00:44:39,540 --> 00:44:42,779
the 3 inch come online to: shouldn't be
day to call

712
00:44:42,780 --> 00:44:46,270
so she goes up the line 0 at 9i will be
molested you what you got to put a

713
00:44:46,270 --> 00:44:49,530
little tag up there's a do not touch
this line only here

714
00:44:49,530 --> 00:44:52,880
if you only do the one that the calling
at party

715
00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:56,650
answers and so are the when the calling
party hangs up

716
00:44:56,650 --> 00:44:59,990
and so that was how it how it all worked
arm

717
00:44:59,990 --> 00:45:03,410
so after while I'm I one thing I didn't
wanna try it was

718
00:45:03,410 --> 00:45:06,810
autobahn me talk little bit about how to
buy much time doing

719
00:45:06,810 --> 00:45:10,210
time we got a 10 minute warning about
how minutes ago your

720
00:45:10,210 --> 00:45:15,180
Butler okay um Otto von and Donovan was
nicholson Creek Alaska

721
00:45:15,180 --> 00:45:18,960
and Murphy Don alaska and the acts which
is up there

722
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:22,630
that serve both are gone and regular
commercial

723
00:45:22,630 --> 00:45:26,200
traffic and those were the only switches
it did that and the only thing that they

724
00:45:26,200 --> 00:45:28,819
did was a class mark the switches

725
00:45:28,819 --> 00:45:32,700
so if you're coming from 940 in calling
to 950

726
00:45:32,700 --> 00:45:38,700
its cool you can actually make a costly
call 940 950 1230

727
00:45:38,700 --> 00:45:42,700
you get our ads which and then you blow
up the 2600

728
00:45:42,700 --> 00:45:46,330
just a little burst and these trunks for
a little bit different

729
00:45:46,330 --> 00:45:50,160
I it would drop you all the way back to
NORAD center

730
00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:53,759
and that left me right on the no red
truck from there I could do flash crash

731
00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:56,380
override priority and everything like
that

732
00:45:56,380 --> 00:46:00,440
and I i had total control the military
phone network to do anything I want with

733
00:46:00,440 --> 00:46:01,160
it

734
00:46:01,160 --> 00:46:04,779
hours I was like route access to it arm

735
00:46:04,780 --> 00:46:09,440
so and in now I want a little bit about
kinda what I'm doing now

736
00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:13,280
and a and things are going wrong so I
have time

737
00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:17,030
on currently right now I'm working on a
book and

738
00:46:17,030 --> 00:46:20,180
and I think we're gonna call it I hacked
this life

739
00:46:20,180 --> 00:46:23,460
I already done three chapters first
chapter is done online

740
00:46:23,460 --> 00:46:27,150
second chapter was hacking the Russian
not KGB system which I don't think

741
00:46:27,150 --> 00:46:29,069
anybody else heard yet

742
00:46:29,069 --> 00:46:32,850
now and a the and %uh some stuff I was
doing in Germany

743
00:46:32,850 --> 00:46:37,029
and that it goes on and I'm so be
looking forward to the book

744
00:46:37,030 --> 00:46:40,480

750
00:46:59,260 --> 00:47:02,910
I guess he say what finally became me
like I'm retired from the freaking

756
00:47:16,410 --> 00:47:19,850
this are listening year and that they
say told me later when the

757
00:47:19,850 --> 00:47:23,680
par the deal was when I only had to
plead guilty to a misdemeanor do no jail

758
00:47:23,680 --> 00:47:25,750
time five hundred dollar fine for

759
00:47:25,750 --> 00:47:30,170
dollars probation but that's the law
money a fork in 1970

760
00:47:30,170 --> 00:47:34,760
I am they still can't figure out how I
was doing when they're my reconfigure

761
00:47:34,760 --> 00:47:36,859
the down up to talk business with

762
00:47:36,859 --> 00:47:41,750
dumping the 53 director of solid are the
dreamers I told them how exactly how I

763
00:47:41,750 --> 00:47:42,549
do it

764
00:47:42,549 --> 00:47:46,290
so the patch the loop all I think I'll
make they realize that

765
00:47:46,290 --> 00:47:50,660
well the only rarely patch this loophole
is to replace it with the SS and be done

766
00:47:50,660 --> 00:47:51,569
with it

767
00:47:51,569 --> 00:47:57,200
but I am so that's why a serve to more
of a lower profile name was a good boy I

768
00:47:57,200 --> 00:48:00,810
didn't even call luper rounds for the
three years eyes on probation because

769
00:48:00,810 --> 00:48:02,440
they didn't want to be cell

770
00:48:02,440 --> 00:48:05,640
celled up in a big guy named Bubba would
make me his bitch

771
00:48:05,640 --> 00:48:10,839
me and I got also outfitted and also

772
00:48:10,839 --> 00:48:14,240
no second and third time sometime

773
00:48:14,240 --> 00:48:18,880
between the time that I did the that the
white house to buy that paper crisis

774
00:48:18,880 --> 00:48:19,440
which I

775
00:48:19,440 --> 00:48:22,760
you've all heard that I'm not gonna go
in at I am

776
00:48:22,760 --> 00:48:26,589
but that was sorta when I ap when I got
stitched on

777
00:48:26,589 --> 00:48:31,009
and now cabinet Adam Bouwman was the ESN
H

778
00:48:31,010 --> 00:48:34,190
he basically a testified for the FBI and

779
00:48:34,190 --> 00:48:38,580
they came interested me on that was the
second time

780
00:48:38,580 --> 00:48:42,549
and but I had not done anything since
that time except I

781
00:48:42,549 --> 00:48:45,950
am when his friends at a payphone

782
00:48:45,950 --> 00:48:49,680
made a call at a pay phone with the blue
box net people have been tapped because

783
00:48:49,680 --> 00:48:51,600
they've been previously arranged by

784
00:48:51,600 --> 00:48:55,200
an inbound and that I was going to use
that phone in a certain time

785
00:48:55,200 --> 00:48:58,540
and so it was pretty easy for them to
set up a and dialed number recording on

786
00:48:58,540 --> 00:49:01,250
it and that I got done in the second
time

787
00:49:01,250 --> 00:49:05,120
and of course they also said that even
if they had been snitched on if I had

788
00:49:05,120 --> 00:49:06,160
kept it up

789
00:49:06,160 --> 00:49:09,560
they were still trying to figure out why
the here National Traffic Alice amber

790
00:49:09,560 --> 00:49:10,290
audino

791
00:49:10,290 --> 00:49:14,410
for a have gone up a thousand percent
yeah and the yeah

792
00:49:14,410 --> 00:49:18,230
and the FBI when they came in they found
the NCIC

793
00:49:18,230 --> 00:49:22,080
crime by computer manual and

794
00:49:22,080 --> 00:49:26,109
they were also very interested in how I
was able to tap the FBI

795
00:49:26,109 --> 00:49:30,740
so up in that in cooperation with the
authorities

796
00:49:30,740 --> 00:49:34,549
which I'd didn't get any jail time for I

797
00:49:34,549 --> 00:49:38,530
well actually I did I got four months in
Lompoc which was kinda like a

798
00:49:38,530 --> 00:49:41,580
summer camp for kids basically

799
00:49:41,580 --> 00:49:45,640
so up our while I was there course I
would have phone free classes and

800
00:49:45,640 --> 00:49:52,640
teachers the body and i got really
popular

801
00:49:54,710 --> 00:50:01,369
occurs on getting me close to the modern
era people are aware a book by having my

802
00:50:01,369 --> 00:50:01,799
own

803
00:50:01,799 --> 00:50:05,890
area code where I live in Florida now
you're the Kennedy Space Center

804
00:50:05,890 --> 00:50:10,598
so when there was pulling 407 arm I
decided to look up above the

805
00:50:10,599 --> 00:50:14,549
was that Nampa the North American number
administration and found the

806
00:50:14,549 --> 00:50:18,079
the number 321 was available

807
00:50:18,079 --> 00:50:21,349
and that struck a chord somehow so I
want the Public Service Commission

808
00:50:21,349 --> 00:50:21,910
hearing

809
00:50:21,910 --> 00:50:26,009
and explain to them that Cape Canaveral
the countdown capital the world really

810
00:50:26,009 --> 00:50:26,630
should get

811
00:50:26,630 --> 00:50:30,190
3 21 so the way I look at it is

812
00:50:30,190 --> 00:50:34,979
I asked for it they approved in so must
be my area code

813
00:50:34,979 --> 00:50:41,979
but I share pp

814
00:50:43,990 --> 00:50:46,579
hard so these days though to

815
00:50:46,579 --> 00:50:50,260
be a freak in the 21st century what I'm
doing now is reading web pages

816
00:50:50,260 --> 00:50:53,980
meant to be read on mobile phone web
browsers mostly just don't like flash

817
00:50:53,980 --> 00:50:58,420
but I don't think you need to write an
app that specifically for a specific

818
00:50:58,420 --> 00:50:59,599
piece of hardware

819
00:50:59,599 --> 00:51:03,599
Aug candy bar phone flip phones can read
simple HTML

820
00:51:03,599 --> 00:51:07,599
in if are you trying to do is get the
information content out all use a simple

821
00:51:07,599 --> 00:51:08,359
web page

822
00:51:08,359 --> 00:51:12,950
if you visit hope 9 that's normal night
hopp 9.9

823
00:51:12,950 --> 00:51:16,630
are dotMobi m.o.b I you'll find the
webpage

824
00:51:16,630 --> 00:51:20,650
are created for this conference and you
can move around their schedule by

825
00:51:20,650 --> 00:51:22,710
pushing the buttons on your touch-tone
dial

826
00:51:22,710 --> 00:51:25,720
on the phone paired on your mobile phone

827
00:51:25,720 --> 00:51:29,809
annual numbers one two and three are the
schedule for Friday Saturday and Sunday

828
00:51:29,809 --> 00:51:32,829
than the time of day at the top of each
page

829
00:51:32,829 --> 00:51:36,720
you maneuver with little maneuvering
thing to the hour you want and tell you

830
00:51:36,720 --> 00:51:41,039
what's on the schedule for that time
very possible kinds of web sites and

831
00:51:41,039 --> 00:51:41,660
pages

832
00:51:41,660 --> 00:51:44,819
and that's why morphed into being a
phone for in the 21st century

833
00:51:44,819 --> 00:51:49,288
