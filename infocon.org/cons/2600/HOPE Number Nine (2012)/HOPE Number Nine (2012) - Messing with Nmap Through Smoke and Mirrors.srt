1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:03,730
and I wanna say the layout just first
that's a really big honor to be here

2
00:00:03,730 --> 00:00:08,480
on so like security that's awesome on
securities like really awesome

3
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:11,570
and you guys are awesome so thanks a lot
for %uh keeping up

4
00:00:11,570 --> 00:00:15,420
and I you keep doing your thing I could
do my thing items talk is called into

5
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:18,650
your cunt network and your conscience
messing with and after smoking mirrors

6
00:00:18,650 --> 00:00:24,699
even started so among start by taking a
bit of up to look back and

7
00:00:24,699 --> 00:00:27,730
talk about what I'm going to talk about
and also by congress we're not going to

8
00:00:27,730 --> 00:00:28,430
be speaking of

9
00:00:28,430 --> 00:00:32,269
I'm so consider like three main phases
all

10
00:00:32,270 --> 00:00:36,570
network attack I'm you can find a Sunday
Aug and a text book anywhere cuz I

11
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:37,469
completely made up

12
00:00:37,469 --> 00:00:42,600
weekend think it as gaining access so to
some network right so gaining access can

13
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:45,289
mean like exploiting and externally
facing computer

14
00:00:45,289 --> 00:00:48,320
or maybe you're like literally crawling
through the air ducts

15
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:52,730
of like the Gibson corporation right I'm
I we don't really care so from our

16
00:00:52,730 --> 00:00:55,850
perspective like we don't care like how
to gain access to it we assume you gain

17
00:00:55,850 --> 00:00:57,719
access to you bypass the firewall you be

18
00:00:57,719 --> 00:01:01,030
bypass something else in the border
security on Step 2 was performer

19
00:01:01,030 --> 00:01:03,059
Constance this were actually concerned
about here

20
00:01:03,059 --> 00:01:06,090
are so you want to find out everything
you can about the network

21
00:01:06,090 --> 00:01:08,960
that it is you want to attack for you
want to find out how many systems are

22
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:12,740
what types systems are operating system
sports everything right sorry we talk

23
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:13,710
about what we can do to

24
00:01:13,710 --> 00:01:17,909
to tax that presence just like the
reconnaissance also prevent I'm in

25
00:01:17,909 --> 00:01:19,560
threes explain vulnerability

26
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:22,900
so you wanna in them in the content and
in the process of

27
00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:26,650
are for Nikon since you hope to find
some vulnerability they're going to

28
00:01:26,650 --> 00:01:29,560
exploit and then you actually send the
payload rights or not be talking about

29
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:29,939
that

30
00:01:29,939 --> 00:01:33,340
should not be talking about intrusion
detection in the classical sense like

31
00:01:33,340 --> 00:01:34,409
store does write like

32
00:01:34,409 --> 00:01:38,220
looking for the blaster warm as it goes
across your network cannot be trying to

33
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:38,920
get it back

34
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:42,380
we're just gonna cost remember to
spokesman second phase and your

35
00:01:42,380 --> 00:01:43,130
conscience

36
00:01:43,130 --> 00:01:46,280
so talk about obscuring your network or

37
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:50,750
more specifically obfuscating more
technically speaking ons or not we talk

38
00:01:50,750 --> 00:01:52,200
on church in detection prevention

39
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:56,320
on your access control right so if you
think like art will

40
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:59,420
we found a bad guy let's kick in from
the network but that's not really what

41
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:00,329
we're trying to do here

42
00:02:00,329 --> 00:02:03,899
or trying to bomb provide and your posts

43
00:02:03,899 --> 00:02:06,909
on this replies to private networks

44
00:02:06,909 --> 00:02:10,349
I'm so print networks are not normally
publicly accessible

45
00:02:10,348 --> 00:02:13,369
arm so that would mean like not public
networks

46
00:02:13,370 --> 00:02:16,640
so like your university I think I don't
like library like

47
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:18,959
right like you can just walk around and
look at the computers in the library

48
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:19,890
right like this

49
00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:25,310
but I really much I can do against Allah
for apps offer perspective also external

50
00:02:25,310 --> 00:02:27,060
machines like Google's web server

51
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:30,069
like can't be helped by anything about
to talk about right like as you need to

52
00:02:30,069 --> 00:02:32,819
know where he was web server is and that
poor needy is open

53
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:37,800
like ike I can help you also doesn't
help anything against social engineering

54
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:42,510
so like your blog phone up like a
operator in shoes into telling you all

55
00:02:42,510 --> 00:02:45,530
your details likes nothing I can do
about that and also just plain stupidity

56
00:02:45,530 --> 00:02:48,900
right like if you post a picture of your
network onto the internet nothing I can

57
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:49,269
do about

58
00:02:49,269 --> 00:02:52,879
okay what we want to stop the actually
talk about so I'm

59
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:56,370
four-time enter causes talk a little bit
about reconnaissance I'm in a little bit

60
00:02:56,370 --> 00:02:56,910
why

61
00:02:56,910 --> 00:03:00,170
on how it works and a little bit why I'm
how it's hard to prevent

62
00:03:00,170 --> 00:03:04,090
on so wanted Mike most basic things
wanna find out when he first gained

63
00:03:04,090 --> 00:03:05,890
access and trying for Constance is

64
00:03:05,890 --> 00:03:10,170
how many seasons are there what
computers are up I'm so using our troops

65
00:03:10,170 --> 00:03:11,000
can for this

66
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,239
times when the most basic techniques arc
is the address resolution protocol

67
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:18,220
it's a way of finding out what mac
Address is associate with a given IP

68
00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:18,810
address

69
00:03:18,810 --> 00:03:22,220
you know the IP even find out the mac
Address to send out in our practices hey

70
00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:25,489
192 168 1.1 what's your address

71
00:03:25,489 --> 00:03:29,239
and if he responds as here's my mac
address that means he exists

72
00:03:29,239 --> 00:03:33,090
or you know well as this computer up
there right if he doesn't respond that

73
00:03:33,090 --> 00:03:35,659
probably means that it doesn't exist
releases more than a half away

74
00:03:35,659 --> 00:03:40,370
you can use this pretty calm another
easy way of doing that is using a pain

75
00:03:40,370 --> 00:03:43,580
getting everybody knows pain are you
sent a ping request to send a pic reply

76
00:03:43,580 --> 00:03:46,950
get a reply back to his is there though
up

77
00:03:46,950 --> 00:03:50,459
paying I i cnt in general of unblocking
balking at work so

78
00:03:50,459 --> 00:03:53,909
a negative response ripping sometimes
just means that King ICM is being

79
00:03:53,909 --> 00:03:54,340
filtered

80
00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:58,000
on so then now you know what ports

81
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,189
or what conditions exist on this
democratic found out like what IP

82
00:04:01,189 --> 00:04:02,000
addresses how

83
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,569
machines behind them want to say one
finds more information like what ports

84
00:04:05,569 --> 00:04:05,840
or

85
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:09,340
cent sports are a really big thing for
network security right the gas attack

86
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:10,230
surface

87
00:04:10,230 --> 00:04:14,420
like more ports that are open on machine
more things I could possibly go wrong

88
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:18,530
which is really good for you attack so
he sent a TCP packet ready said the same

89
00:04:18,530 --> 00:04:20,329
packet outs to try to connect to the

90
00:04:20,329 --> 00:04:24,030
server I'm to try to connect service
right to get a syntax back

91
00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:27,540
then I mean sports open to get easily
reset supports closed

92
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:29,660
and there's some other details here
there's lots of other weird things

93
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:33,360
happen but those are the two most
obvious ones right I'm sure you can you

94
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:33,770
tease

95
00:04:33,770 --> 00:04:37,780
a connectionless so you just send data
this is Noah connection right you to

96
00:04:37,780 --> 00:04:40,210
send the data packet and if you get a
data packet back

97
00:04:40,210 --> 00:04:43,440
means open on though energy get an ICP

98
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:46,870
up for a ritual disclosed the forces of
some other situations like it happened

99
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:47,810
like if you don't get a poor

100
00:04:47,810 --> 00:04:51,660
a packet back Matt I could mean that it
it's open because I'm gonna pack it back

101
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:54,680
yet or could mean it's closer maybe as a
firewall

102
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:58,580
with lots of other things but as the
basic idea right

103
00:04:58,580 --> 00:05:05,580
arms offering system shopping seasons
are little more interesting

104
00:05:06,610 --> 00:05:10,680
I'm so a and nap at least up to tax
operating system let's talk a little bit

105
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:12,070
about an app on

106
00:05:12,070 --> 00:05:15,750
over we're doing here up later I'll show
you to we made

107
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:19,039
I'm it doesn't specifically target
target and map but in memphis is a

108
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:20,340
course in the canonical

109
00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:25,120
tool used to do network mapping I'm so
specifically what I'm aptos to

110
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:27,550
figure out what operating system is
running on computers really quite

111
00:05:27,550 --> 00:05:28,630
ingenious

112
00:05:28,630 --> 00:05:31,800
um they sent out in the legal TCPIP

113
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:35,289
packet the use I cept is Pnut

114
00:05:35,289 --> 00:05:39,650
is the senate a legal packet so some
packing work if you have the TCPIP spec

115
00:05:39,650 --> 00:05:42,870
break typed out right in front of you
and you're the programmer

116
00:05:42,870 --> 00:05:47,389
of like the SkyTeam stack for for
operating system

117
00:05:47,389 --> 00:05:50,940
is it what should I do I get this packet
the answers that's not on there's like

118
00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:52,500
it's not inspec

119
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:55,770
so use up to make up like Shasta you
figure out a way to write

120
00:05:55,770 --> 00:05:59,318
rights your response somehow but
everyone's going to a different way

121
00:05:59,319 --> 00:06:02,910
so all the operating systems 12
responding differently in fact different

122
00:06:02,910 --> 00:06:05,550
versions of different offerings this one
respond differently cuz

123
00:06:05,550 --> 00:06:08,860
undefined behavior so we can use this to
figure out what operating system is

124
00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:11,660
running so we sent some weird shaped
package right

125
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:15,400
that kinda looks like Australia family
I'm

126
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:19,289
and like windows will respond in the
spare unique kind of ugly way

127
00:06:19,289 --> 00:06:22,909
and when XO responds very nice shapely
sorta way

128
00:06:22,910 --> 00:06:25,750
but their unique us the important right
like the you can tell the difference

129
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:27,750
between those two things

130
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:32,560
communuity final operators is right on
some never to apology is nothing you

131
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:33,690
will find right you're fine

132
00:06:33,690 --> 00:06:37,550
not just got to find the exact apology
the networks use trace route to do this

133
00:06:37,550 --> 00:06:40,250
I won't go through the details on
exactly what race are at work sites like

134
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:41,620
pretty standard

135
00:06:41,620 --> 00:06:45,069
complex that that the picture there's
actually help but from other

136
00:06:45,069 --> 00:06:48,350
does and map the visualization tool
inside of and map

137
00:06:48,350 --> 00:06:51,620
see like that an actual I picture you
can get from and now

138
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:56,000
somebody's network to find like like
who's behind exactly what router and

139
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,539
stuff like that which is all really and

140
00:06:57,539 --> 00:07:00,990
more information on steam for an
attacker

141
00:07:00,990 --> 00:07:04,150
on 61 a fine is what services are
actually running on

142
00:07:04,150 --> 00:07:09,870
ports are open on and for the most part
this kinda follows naturally from what

143
00:07:09,870 --> 00:07:11,000
port there on

144
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,110
on but also you want to find out what
versions of services are running since

145
00:07:14,110 --> 00:07:14,539
thats

146
00:07:14,539 --> 00:07:18,199
you know highly important running really
all version of some service

147
00:07:18,199 --> 00:07:21,360
not something you want to find out and
so this works really somewhat operating

148
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:22,810
system detection

149
00:07:22,810 --> 00:07:25,639
where you can like San unique packets
like different versions will send you

150
00:07:25,639 --> 00:07:26,680
difference of back

151
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:30,550
don't in fact most the time the services
and the operating systems are just given

152
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:31,789
to you for free

153
00:07:31,789 --> 00:07:36,190
like if you just go to a web server like
the HTP banner on it what to say

154
00:07:36,190 --> 00:07:39,979
hey I'm Windows version this running
Apache version this

155
00:07:39,979 --> 00:07:44,159
or I can you go to a telnet server say
hey this is telnet server exactly .1 .3

156
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:45,520
.3 .1

157
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:50,020
like running Windows this right so there
are some ways like scrubbing those in

158
00:07:50,020 --> 00:07:52,919
our schools scrubbing those but I think
in general

159
00:07:52,919 --> 00:07:57,000
like they're not used or people to know
about them I'm so

160
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:01,080
and to the canonical to like I said for
doing all this stuff is an app I'm so

161
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:05,109
the tool that I i have your little show
and a lot other research that we don

162
00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:08,729
isn't targeting an app specifically
looking at work anything else except and

163
00:08:08,729 --> 00:08:09,460
now

164
00:08:09,460 --> 00:08:14,310
on but your that's that obvious things
talk

165
00:08:14,310 --> 00:08:17,319
so why is detecting reconnaissance hard
I'm

166
00:08:17,319 --> 00:08:20,319
I think I went back up this assertion
with a I'm

167
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:24,770
like hard proof in the slides I think
most people just can't give up

168
00:08:24,770 --> 00:08:28,500
on Const people to safeguard over and
try to find a blast dormant

169
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:31,860
ideas in my network and I'll put some
like firewalls

170
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:35,219
the edge minority people from going
again and that's it right

171
00:08:35,219 --> 00:08:39,510
and well you know like how many
computers I have isn't a secret so

172
00:08:39,510 --> 00:08:43,409
action try to trans fat issues give up
on reconnaissance

173
00:08:43,409 --> 00:08:46,890
arm and i think is a couple reasons
white ones that its hard two signatures

174
00:08:46,890 --> 00:08:47,339
fail

175
00:08:47,339 --> 00:08:51,320
right signatures are how we work at
security community we love signatures

176
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:55,089
they were from monetization standpoint
they also like kinda work

177
00:08:55,089 --> 00:08:59,459
i least when they do work they work well
but all the stuff I talked about before

178
00:08:59,459 --> 00:09:00,610
are identical to

179
00:09:00,610 --> 00:09:04,089
packet level like there's no difference
between our packet that's been used to

180
00:09:04,089 --> 00:09:04,700
scan you

181
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:08,120
and an actual our packet the people use
cuz networks used

182
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:11,959
right I'm pain can be sometimes blocked
but even then like that

183
00:09:11,959 --> 00:09:15,050
is really annoying we're on a network
for ping is blocked people complain

184
00:09:15,050 --> 00:09:15,930
about it

185
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:19,810
I mean in like pain is a but it's what
it's made forty meters

186
00:09:19,810 --> 00:09:24,630
like to find out what two years earlier
it's a reconnaissance tool

187
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:28,839
saw lots of practice P sends like in a
perfect world which we might think like

188
00:09:28,839 --> 00:09:31,630
although maybe if somebody sends a tease
peace n

189
00:09:31,630 --> 00:09:34,930
for that doesn't have finished the
connection like 10 weekly so that

190
00:09:34,930 --> 00:09:36,120
hostile but it's not

191
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:39,200
you know in academia that might sound
like a good thing to do but the real

192
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:39,990
world networks

193
00:09:39,990 --> 00:09:43,930
how like weird stuff goes on you ceased
racing packets like all the time

194
00:09:43,930 --> 00:09:47,000
if you put a signature that says like
anytime I see

195
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,769
like 1.2 the three TCP handshake packets

196
00:09:50,769 --> 00:09:55,459
hours geiger alert for that you getting
alerts constant

197
00:09:55,459 --> 00:09:58,390
on suspicion is another issue right you
can be a really really slow and I could

198
00:09:58,390 --> 00:09:59,110
be still think

199
00:09:59,110 --> 00:10:04,180
send a packet for our per day or are
even less rate may be stealthy

200
00:10:04,180 --> 00:10:08,980
or being super fast to be stealthy like
you can be like fish for anyone noticed

201
00:10:08,980 --> 00:10:12,589
on and also a pic was that a question

202
00:10:12,589 --> 00:10:16,660
seasoning on also because the Tigers
already inside you know we're kinda by

203
00:10:16,660 --> 00:10:18,040
definition this right

204
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:21,339
solve your border security is pointless
like your firewall if you have

205
00:10:21,339 --> 00:10:25,050
your firewall top your network only
covering Internet traffic

206
00:10:25,050 --> 00:10:28,399
than it it doesn't work because none
other traffic is getting hit by

207
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:31,430
even if you did how signatures that
worked here right you have to have a

208
00:10:31,430 --> 00:10:32,290
firewall

209
00:10:32,290 --> 00:10:39,290
like onto the hosts are between all the
network actions

210
00:10:41,670 --> 00:10:45,069
but something more fundamental going on
here as well arm is the fact that you're

211
00:10:45,070 --> 00:10:45,800
talking about

212
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:50,120
isn't data its meta-data and meta-data
camping crypt

213
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:54,209
so wanna the like mean ways that we like
security people

214
00:10:54,209 --> 00:10:57,660
deal with on security issues is by

215
00:10:57,660 --> 00:11:00,779
encrypting cuz incursions awesome right
arm

216
00:11:00,779 --> 00:11:04,010
so you consider yourself you have a
packet writer some

217
00:11:04,010 --> 00:11:07,140
message that you wanna send you can
create the contents data

218
00:11:07,140 --> 00:11:11,230
and weekend you know prices do this and
we can

219
00:11:11,230 --> 00:11:15,440
say with of high degree of security out
like contents the data secure that's

220
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:16,050
like

221
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:19,320
one of the best things like our security
needs don't like corruption

222
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:23,079
really problem friction I'm but you
can't do his encrypts

223
00:11:23,079 --> 00:11:27,070
a meditative the packet right you can
encrypt when the packet was arrived

224
00:11:27,070 --> 00:11:30,089
you can criticize the packet although
you can pat it but even then

225
00:11:30,089 --> 00:11:34,829
right the Act how it's received isn't

226
00:11:34,829 --> 00:11:38,100
you can trip to the direction that the
traffic packet was going all the stuff

227
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:40,300
is meditative

228
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:43,620
and so I might have equally titled The
talk

229
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:47,620
network steganography right on in many
ways what are you talking about is very

230
00:11:47,620 --> 00:11:48,800
similar to steganography

231
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:53,670
gonna call network steganography but
I've and reconnaissance sounds cool

232
00:11:53,670 --> 00:11:56,689
so we can do is this I love animation
away

233
00:11:56,690 --> 00:12:01,160
we just throwing a lot of other data and
now you don't know which one is real

234
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:04,120
and even if you did know which worry if
you want to find out which one is really

235
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:04,889
have to like

236
00:12:04,889 --> 00:12:08,160
open all the messages it's very
cumbersome process through injuries a

237
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:09,060
process

238
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:12,730
it wasn't as easy as it was before right
before he just knew what it was

239
00:12:12,730 --> 00:12:16,220
on this is what steganography does write
like if you were the canonical example

240
00:12:16,220 --> 00:12:17,550
being like if you're

241
00:12:17,550 --> 00:12:21,399
a prisoner inside a jail and you want to
send a message is somebody outside the

242
00:12:21,399 --> 00:12:22,519
jail

243
00:12:22,519 --> 00:12:26,060
you can't just writing in cryptic
message have like that get out because

244
00:12:26,060 --> 00:12:28,579
the warden is going to take your message
no script

245
00:12:28,579 --> 00:12:31,740
for grow it out you can we build the
send a message

246
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:34,810
so the only way to do it is to have lots
of other messages that seem

247
00:12:34,810 --> 00:12:39,470
perfectly benign and then have your
actual message inside

248
00:12:39,470 --> 00:12:42,750
it doesn't that's where we talk about
doing with network rather than

249
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:47,970
message so really talking about is
trying to make unusual in a haystack or

250
00:12:47,970 --> 00:12:50,040
make you are like actual nodes

251
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:54,050
I'm in your car on a computer network
just 10

252
00:12:54,050 --> 00:12:57,529
Justin you inside a much larger
haystacks we talk about drowning out

253
00:12:57,529 --> 00:13:00,790
your actual notes on network on with
realistic-looking

254
00:13:00,790 --> 00:13:05,560
fake ones on so to do this reviews and
honey D

255
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:09,060
which is a a really awesome show written
by grinding wheels pros

256
00:13:09,060 --> 00:13:12,630
to happens like be here like to attack a
drink or something

257
00:13:12,630 --> 00:13:16,050
arm we had to make some additions to it
I'm so I think I have us

258
00:13:16,050 --> 00:13:20,620
out actually talk about ninety more
specifically a few slides later

259
00:13:20,620 --> 00:13:25,029
soul which I'm so we have two goals here
on two primary goals

260
00:13:25,029 --> 00:13:28,110
on one is to you obfuscate the network
which

261
00:13:28,110 --> 00:13:31,300
you know makes reconnaissance more
difficult

262
00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:35,709
makes it less effective

263
00:13:35,709 --> 00:13:38,470
I'm they also want to identify
reconnaissance mistakes not enough just

264
00:13:38,470 --> 00:13:39,130
to

265
00:13:39,130 --> 00:13:42,980
prevented for just a new make it harder
we actually wanna find out when have to

266
00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:44,010
make an alert

267
00:13:44,010 --> 00:13:47,660
right like when this stuff goes down and
so

268
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:51,370
this is a key a part of like our
research we're figuring out

269
00:13:51,370 --> 00:13:55,240
is that once you have these decoys this
big sell fake machines

270
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:59,190
on that really helps you figure out when
reconnaissance is occurring

271
00:13:59,190 --> 00:14:02,389
because these are decoys honeypots and

272
00:14:02,389 --> 00:14:05,470
people kinda by definition should be
talking to the honey pots

273
00:14:05,470 --> 00:14:08,589
on like they any traffic to them is
presumptively hostile

274
00:14:08,589 --> 00:14:12,120
are you talking about the box why you
send exactly once in packet to all the

275
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:12,990
honey pots

276
00:14:12,990 --> 00:14:16,220
like that there's a spare specific not
only just that talking to them as

277
00:14:16,220 --> 00:14:22,110
is about way as about but afrikaans is a
very telltale signature from the network

278
00:14:22,110 --> 00:14:26,600
lookup I'm so virtual they're using

279
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:30,019
a to do this that term I wrote and

280
00:14:30,019 --> 00:14:34,010
a small team and working with arms open
source project called Nova

281
00:14:34,010 --> 00:14:37,560
our website is project Nova don't work

282
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:41,949
license that's their train CC plus on
runs on you like systems

283
00:14:41,949 --> 00:14:45,540
on about for forty-four thousand lines
of code

284
00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:49,319
a small team that's working with me SBIR
grant

285
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:52,510
so if you have questions about like like
that sort of thing

286
00:14:52,510 --> 00:14:55,990
I think the SBIR project is a really
cool way to start

287
00:14:55,990 --> 00:15:00,430
I'm getting some funding for bottler
security-related open source projects

288
00:15:00,430 --> 00:15:04,980
on so to check us out there download the
code I think I CNN packages that are

289
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:08,579
up that could be considered highly of

290
00:15:08,579 --> 00:15:12,240
have no I made them myself and I really
like a diving packaging guys so

291
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:16,329
obviously knows more about packaging be
really helpful

292
00:15:16,329 --> 00:15:19,529
I'm so you please I like download the
those source

293
00:15:19,529 --> 00:15:22,310
run on your network and see how things
work I'd really like to get some

294
00:15:22,310 --> 00:15:24,290
feedback from

295
00:15:24,290 --> 00:15:27,849
okay so some since we're talking about
honey possibly I talk a little bit about

296
00:15:27,850 --> 00:15:30,660
like how honey pots are used to how they
work usually use

297
00:15:30,660 --> 00:15:34,230
however using them that's different than
typical use case

298
00:15:34,230 --> 00:15:37,250
on so a high-fidelity air quotes

299
00:15:37,250 --> 00:15:40,480
iPod is on usually use in small numbers

300
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:44,459
so they're like real machines so like
its not a typical for a large

301
00:15:44,459 --> 00:15:45,410
organization to

302
00:15:45,410 --> 00:15:48,420
how their IT guys I hate sup actual box

303
00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:51,699
with real hardware and put over there in
the corner and

304
00:15:51,699 --> 00:15:55,949
run it with like like Windows XP no
service packs

305
00:15:55,949 --> 00:15:59,610
which like gets rooted if a light breeze
comes through right

306
00:15:59,610 --> 00:16:02,990
I'm and now we like will have like an
early warning system

307
00:16:02,990 --> 00:16:06,449
because presumably bad guys will see
that no exploit first the idea

308
00:16:06,449 --> 00:16:10,660
right that's the whole point honey or
sometimes use a virtual machine for this

309
00:16:10,660 --> 00:16:13,219
site you won't have to your hardware
your virtual machine that we think it's

310
00:16:13,220 --> 00:16:14,050
router

311
00:16:14,050 --> 00:16:17,399
completely destroyed and you can like
white betting hope that liked the

312
00:16:17,399 --> 00:16:18,589
attackers able to

313
00:16:18,589 --> 00:16:21,670
escape from jail that is the virtual
machine

314
00:16:21,670 --> 00:16:24,699
to certain degrees of success

315
00:16:24,699 --> 00:16:28,350
but their century the same thing at
least in terms of purpose concept

316
00:16:28,350 --> 00:16:32,070
they run real software services that
really do get exploited because that's

317
00:16:32,070 --> 00:16:33,500
the whole purpose

318
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:36,829
arm and they're very useful I'm
forensically I'm so like

319
00:16:36,829 --> 00:16:40,449
if you're trying to figure out after the
fact like what happened

320
00:16:40,449 --> 00:16:43,930
like you know network intrusion I'm
that's really useful in say hey like I

321
00:16:43,930 --> 00:16:46,160
saw the same payload

322
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:51,600
apec came through on the the box to go
twice on the honeypot to use

323
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:55,100
maybe try to go backwards on also

324
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:58,730
really useful are you can but the really
useful academically

325
00:16:58,730 --> 00:17:02,240
I'm so there's like honey at project and
there's lotsa core programs like doubt

326
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:02,720
that

327
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:06,539
try to find like a worldwide you know
viruses are actually going out on the

328
00:17:06,539 --> 00:17:07,280
internet right now

329
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:10,750
suitable network honeypots they get
exploited

330
00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:16,429
and seeking you know get people heads up
before like their network at it by

331
00:17:16,429 --> 00:17:19,809
I'm so in a way the kind used to
distract attention but not really

332
00:17:19,809 --> 00:17:23,289
not really anti reconnaissance when they
were talking about them because

333
00:17:23,289 --> 00:17:28,099
by the by the sheer fact that their like
high fidelity you can't make many

334
00:17:28,100 --> 00:17:31,360
I'm so low fidelity honeypots is the
concern

335
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:35,000
here's the not real machines least not
I'm virtual machines like as you know

336
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:35,600
them

337
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:39,559
in the VMware View are for Joe Boxer
sense right

338
00:17:39,559 --> 00:17:43,039
arms that can be exploited like a
virtual machine can I understand

339
00:17:43,039 --> 00:17:46,600
danger of saying that something can be
exploited in front of a group of actors

340
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:50,059
but I there's an order of magnitude of
simplicity

341
00:17:50,059 --> 00:17:53,260
difference between like a virtual
machine which has like

342
00:17:53,260 --> 00:17:56,789
actually emulating real machine and just
a service that

343
00:17:56,789 --> 00:18:00,129
throwing up packets to pretend like it
is

344
00:18:00,130 --> 00:18:03,150
on C can make these things and mass
which is really important part

345
00:18:03,150 --> 00:18:07,720
you can make and order magnitude more of
them then you have real machines

346
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:11,380
so a single computer can have hundreds
or thousands

347
00:18:11,380 --> 00:18:14,539
these fake machines look real from the
network

348
00:18:14,539 --> 00:18:17,510
but you know don't have all the
trappings regular virtual machine like

349
00:18:17,510 --> 00:18:18,700
to run hard disk

350
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:23,299
their own gramercy I'm so when the comes
a honey do you know if

351
00:18:23,299 --> 00:18:27,840
anybody's following is a handgun and
update like five years

352
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:31,149
and %uh since then and map has gone a
whole new sweet

353
00:18:31,150 --> 00:18:34,270
of operating system probes as or just
responded

354
00:18:34,270 --> 00:18:40,230
wrong and so I call the operating system
results in a lot of even just the normal

355
00:18:40,230 --> 00:18:42,460
results were just like of rape

356
00:18:42,460 --> 00:18:45,530
sweet to give that some attention so if
you go to

357
00:18:45,530 --> 00:18:48,620
way up us ok and that was the reason to
go to you on are

358
00:18:48,620 --> 00:18:52,160
I get home page I'm then we have some
new

359
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:55,620
code for do that response properly to
the new I'm and map

360
00:18:55,620 --> 00:18:59,010
probe so it'll actually like work with
annual approves

361
00:18:59,010 --> 00:19:03,320
water

362
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:09,149
see also honey bee services this
important part about how money works

363
00:19:09,150 --> 00:19:12,270
is that I'm uses scripts as services

364
00:19:12,270 --> 00:19:15,440
I'm so these services can be really
really simple

365
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:19,590
so like when the your virtual machine
fake machine gets data only get like a

366
00:19:19,590 --> 00:19:20,080
packet

367
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:23,850
I'm rather than running an actual like
telnet server it's just a shell script

368
00:19:23,850 --> 00:19:25,210
that response however

369
00:19:25,210 --> 00:19:29,720
complex or simple you want to be so we
have like a service to tell me auto fail

370
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:33,760
work you just you it's like 20 line
scriptwriter takes input

371
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:37,000
and says nopee failed can't login like
log in tonight

372
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:40,200
and you can spend like ours on this
right like trying to login

373
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:44,820
I like %uh I'm where you make them
really complex there's things like that

374
00:19:44,820 --> 00:19:45,730
that pretend to be

375
00:19:45,730 --> 00:19:49,300
infected machines like by my do my
companies like viruses that open up for

376
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:50,649
your service like a listen

377
00:19:50,650 --> 00:19:55,260
for command control signals and like
bill a pretend to be like a man control

378
00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:55,980
signals the like

379
00:19:55,980 --> 00:19:59,160
except but responses right and pretend
to be

380
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:03,440
in fact by those machines answers really
though there's a more complex for those

381
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:04,280
are kinda cool things

382
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:08,920
his other side we have like a I think I
got TP served no

383
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:12,240
we have a message server that like
allows log in required

384
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:16,410
log into the service right minute like
everyone smiled like your

385
00:20:16,410 --> 00:20:19,480
it was so your permission is denied she
can't like

386
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:24,290
she farts won't be too complex on his
own relatively safe because the shell

387
00:20:24,290 --> 00:20:24,920
scripts

388
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:29,450
I'm running at like a super low
privilege level and

389
00:20:29,450 --> 00:20:33,410
unit not they will be the mic or shell
scripts could be possibly spoil because

390
00:20:33,410 --> 00:20:33,890
in order

391
00:20:33,890 --> 00:20:38,180
mangosuthu simplicity between like 100
line shell script and like an actual

392
00:20:38,180 --> 00:20:44,260
running service on Cesar fairly safe to
run sorry so take a step back now

393
00:20:44,260 --> 00:20:47,740
and look at what kinda were wrapped in
terms of

394
00:20:47,740 --> 00:20:51,820
from a tax perspective right so your
attacker you gain access to some network

395
00:20:51,820 --> 00:20:52,540
that's running

396
00:20:52,540 --> 00:20:56,350
this nervous system right and you see
some massive network

397
00:20:56,350 --> 00:21:00,780
has like thousands machines on and some
crazy complex topology

398
00:21:00,780 --> 00:21:04,740
on most these machines are fake but you
don't no doubt

399
00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:09,140
I mean you can spend hours you know
trying their individual services

400
00:21:09,140 --> 00:21:12,450
like trying to log into them and seeing
if their exploitable

401
00:21:12,450 --> 00:21:15,540
and some reconnaissance itself becomes

402
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:18,610
ineffective becomes cumbersome and
objects

403
00:21:18,610 --> 00:21:22,110
and sauna try to talk a little bit about
the obvious part on so

404
00:21:22,110 --> 00:21:26,710
I think we can %uh see how like consts
becomes more difficult like

405
00:21:26,710 --> 00:21:29,810
just the process itself becomes like
really annoying and you know what

406
00:21:29,810 --> 00:21:30,889
machines are fake

407
00:21:30,890 --> 00:21:35,800
and trying to find out what's actually
exploited because really really hard but

408
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:37,640
we don't want just our you want to have
like

409
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:41,170
heads up on the track wanna have like
some like public

410
00:21:41,170 --> 00:21:45,370
lurching like the IT administrators like
smart show writes like a somebody's

411
00:21:45,370 --> 00:21:46,210
doing something bad

412
00:21:46,210 --> 00:21:53,210
tarea up there was a

413
00:21:53,720 --> 00:22:00,300
30 are to repeat the questions cuz on
the Zambian like so you the question is

414
00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:00,680
um

415
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:03,740
he said the machines have like a real
like IP address that's yep that's right

416
00:22:03,740 --> 00:22:10,200
yes I'm seeking something statically or
using DHCP see

417
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:13,300
okay so um want the downside transit
questions the

418
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:16,000
at the end just because I think it's
kinda K usually I can accept questions

419
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,240
during the thing but like

420
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:21,640
if I approaching people was a sec always
so

421
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:24,670
up the process was like hundreds of
these things is fake notes

422
00:22:24,670 --> 00:22:29,230
um one other troubles with some is
actually setting them up by configuring

423
00:22:29,230 --> 00:22:33,300
and I was wondering very early things we
discovered about heidi was that like

424
00:22:33,300 --> 00:22:37,290
and overhead in terms of manpower like
setting up these fake versions is really

425
00:22:37,290 --> 00:22:37,840
really high

426
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:41,560
on since have to go through config files
like do with mainly by hand

427
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:45,370
on it's also dangerous process are
dangerous I say in the way of

428
00:22:45,370 --> 00:22:49,710
0 actually thats news there dangers in
the sense that

429
00:22:49,710 --> 00:22:53,970
I'm as easy misconfigured right because
the whole point of these fake machines

430
00:22:53,970 --> 00:22:57,820
have to look real they'd look believable
to an attacker and so if you like

431
00:22:57,820 --> 00:23:02,360
a BSD box like a fiction the pretence
BST that's running MSRP see

432
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:05,820
then it's like probably about right
liked kinda giveaway

433
00:23:05,820 --> 00:23:09,760
on this awesome other subtle things to
like if your network

434
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:12,940
is all just like a Linux server farm and
you have like

435
00:23:12,940 --> 00:23:16,600
entire sacked like section like Windows
machines and those are fake ones over

436
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:17,930
fake missions all Windows

437
00:23:17,930 --> 00:23:20,870
over real ones are winik's that's
probably about to write you got i cant

438
00:23:20,870 --> 00:23:22,350
an obvious separation

439
00:23:22,350 --> 00:23:26,120
as you want something that looks like
your network but a little bit different

440
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:29,120
so week well we deal with this as well

441
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:32,890
I'm so a lot of what we do is try to run
providing easy front-end

442
00:23:32,890 --> 00:23:35,920
I'm friend bout are for frontier other

443
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:39,330
on so you can create these virtual high
parts with a nice pretty Korean stuff

444
00:23:39,330 --> 00:23:39,970
like that

445
00:23:39,970 --> 00:23:43,280
on the bar really we have when the
things we just finished

446
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:46,430
actually is on the sorrow
configurability a master tears I say

447
00:23:46,430 --> 00:23:48,150
just finished I mean like last week

448
00:23:48,150 --> 00:23:52,600
so not a morning it's like really fresh
so does it and maps your network

449
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:56,510
people like Obama you give the subnet on
and master networker finds out what what

450
00:23:56,510 --> 00:23:57,420
computers are there

451
00:23:57,420 --> 00:24:01,340
operating systems are unimportant stuff
like that right and it generates

452
00:24:01,340 --> 00:24:05,310
an entire pay stock for these things art
sales tax and I'll

453
00:24:05,310 --> 00:24:08,649
and Parsons 180 config file so you have
up in it like

454
00:24:08,650 --> 00:24:11,890
randomized situations you have a slider
bar to say I want like

455
00:24:11,890 --> 00:24:15,080
really random or slightly less random
and then it makes

456
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:18,570
um when these fake networks for that
looks like your network but a little bit

457
00:24:18,570 --> 00:24:19,120
different

458
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:22,320
for you know how different depending on
how March 16

459
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:26,030
I'm so that like makes saying such a
greasy his company

460
00:24:26,030 --> 00:24:29,220
of course you know the the the irony
from

461
00:24:29,220 --> 00:24:34,030
using and mapped seat and prevent and
map is not lost on me

462
00:24:34,030 --> 00:24:38,670
como adding salt there in a second

463
00:24:38,670 --> 00:24:45,500
arts a classification some other that
need crunchy part of the topic here

464
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:49,430
so with high fidelity honeypots um
classification is done like manually

465
00:24:49,430 --> 00:24:49,890
right

466
00:24:49,890 --> 00:24:53,300
like expecting log files secure the IT
guy at like

467
00:24:53,300 --> 00:24:56,960
a network and your boss comes to us as a
team

468
00:24:56,960 --> 00:25:00,110
catch a bad guys today like how would
you answer that question

469
00:25:00,110 --> 00:25:03,560
if you've got like a high-fidelity I you
gotta go to the log files and I don't

470
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:04,270
maybe you

471
00:25:04,270 --> 00:25:07,190
maybe you've got some automated tools
maybe you've got something that like

472
00:25:07,190 --> 00:25:10,270
tells a shadow file changers something
like that right

473
00:25:10,270 --> 00:25:13,810
but for the most part so really manual
process it's really knowing it takes a

474
00:25:13,810 --> 00:25:15,030
lot of time

475
00:25:15,030 --> 00:25:20,500
on because like signatures like IDS
antivirus or things help but not really

476
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:22,720
in the sensible connaissance

477
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:26,430
10 singers mostly fail in this case

478
00:25:26,430 --> 00:25:30,440
I'm sorry top doing his machine learning
I'm so this is like a

479
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:33,850
really cool sorta part about this i
really want to get in on so them

480
00:25:33,850 --> 00:25:36,090
the over the air using for machine
learning is called the k-nearest

481
00:25:36,090 --> 00:25:38,210
neighbors over them first to school

482
00:25:38,210 --> 00:25:42,560
learning on this is a totally normal
like our in the plot people use for lots

483
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:43,230
of things that

484
00:25:43,230 --> 00:25:46,690
have absolutely nothing to do with
network security so

485
00:25:46,690 --> 00:25:50,800
it's actually one more simple algorithms
for machine you find which is why the

486
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:52,540
reason we went for

487
00:25:52,540 --> 00:25:56,090
I'm so the idea that you have and
statistical features

488
00:25:56,090 --> 00:26:00,020
on that are scaler values so well we're
not talking about like

489
00:26:00,020 --> 00:26:03,379
Deepak inspection in fact I think
actually captures the like

490
00:26:03,380 --> 00:26:07,450
the headers think we go a hundred bites
and two packets we only recognize that

491
00:26:07,450 --> 00:26:12,360
on C looking a scaler values like packet
timing I like number IP's contacted

492
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:15,570
for suspects like ports comic number
reports contacted

493
00:26:15,570 --> 00:26:19,179
comic what percentage this haystack to
the thing contact right

494
00:26:19,180 --> 00:26:23,210
and your plot all the scaler values for
suspect in n-dimensional space

495
00:26:23,210 --> 00:26:26,760
only two dimensions due to budget cuts
are showed on the screen

496
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:30,540
I'm and so you match in like per side
you much like percentage

497
00:26:30,540 --> 00:26:33,649
avoid a nappy stacker notes contact on
the x-axis

498
00:26:33,650 --> 00:26:37,360
and some other value on the y-axis right
you have some training that is

499
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:40,750
that set and so just like spam filter
right you have to have training data

500
00:26:40,750 --> 00:26:42,390
have to tell the system

501
00:26:42,390 --> 00:26:45,630
what's good and what's bad what possibly
looks like what the nineteen

502
00:26:45,630 --> 00:26:49,370
looks like he plotted on a graph like
this I'm

503
00:26:49,370 --> 00:26:52,740
helms yes you popped

504
00:26:52,740 --> 00:26:56,380
all these days all the state an
n-dimensional space

505
00:26:56,380 --> 00:26:59,780
when you query point is green guy with a
question mark in the center right

506
00:26:59,780 --> 00:27:03,600
say are you here's a point is your order
is the bad like I found a new suspect

507
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:07,020
I calculated the state a foreign
applauded monograph is eager is about

508
00:27:07,020 --> 00:27:08,480
how do you answer that question

509
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:12,190
well it's fairly simple here you just
search for its K nearest neighbors were

510
00:27:12,190 --> 00:27:14,010
case I'm constantly choose

511
00:27:14,010 --> 00:27:17,720
so the inner circle there's three we say
are well there's

512
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:20,920
got to red triangles and 1 Blue Square

513
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:25,050
and so majority votes say he's going to
be a red triangle

514
00:27:25,050 --> 00:27:29,669
which maybe means hostile system right
in reality we use that distance metric

515
00:27:29,670 --> 00:27:30,350
to try to get a

516
00:27:30,350 --> 00:27:34,840
so we will just use a majority go value
0 to 100 means

517
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:38,500
almost surely benign and one means
almost surely hostile

518
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:42,340
I'm going to do this we use a a library
called the band which is awesome its

519
00:27:42,340 --> 00:27:46,690
in the cabin to repose as the
approximate nearest neighbors

520
00:27:46,690 --> 00:27:50,180
out for them library it's one of those
things were like they don't

521
00:27:50,180 --> 00:27:53,770
they they introduce some very small
amount air attacks a configurable

522
00:27:53,770 --> 00:27:58,650
are many introduces what some big
performance gains

523
00:27:58,650 --> 00:28:02,950
I'm and so a if you're data points are
selected well rather if your features

524
00:28:02,950 --> 00:28:04,000
are selected well

525
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:07,430
these points in your and dimensional
space should naturally tend to cluster

526
00:28:07,430 --> 00:28:08,200
of

527
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:11,260
like if they're spread evenly about

528
00:28:11,260 --> 00:28:14,879
like more or less without any order the
means like your day does not correlate

529
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:16,110
into anything

530
00:28:16,110 --> 00:28:19,200
I'm if every if your data shows and well
our using data

531
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:23,560
your own features shows well like a
hostile gosh look at a club up in one

532
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:24,139
area

533
00:28:24,140 --> 00:28:29,410
nine guys kinda club open one area
because that's what data suggest

534
00:28:29,410 --> 00:28:33,080
Arts in response on when we do we
actually find a bad guy

535
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:36,050
ons like I said before we don't want to
do things like injecting them from the

536
00:28:36,050 --> 00:28:37,040
network or black

537
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:40,270
blacklisting now we want to do that
stuff since as:

538
00:28:40,270 --> 00:28:43,480
we don't have the authority to do that
right since for prices to be some piece

539
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:45,230
of software running somewhere in the
networking

540
00:28:45,230 --> 00:28:48,630
will have the ability to projecting from
the network boss because you don't want

541
00:28:48,630 --> 00:28:49,340
you

542
00:28:49,340 --> 00:28:53,560
because if your cure if the attacker
knows our system is on here right and

543
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:56,600
they've suddenly get a check to the
network than like a like

544
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:59,820
that gives them some information about
like the stuff that I scan was enough to

545
00:28:59,820 --> 00:29:01,220
know that I'm hostile

546
00:29:01,220 --> 00:29:04,760
they can use that against us on so what
we gonna do that so we're not playing

547
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:06,050
the role that ideas

548
00:29:06,050 --> 00:29:09,070
ons wanna make an alert which is one
thing we want to do comes with a couple

549
00:29:09,070 --> 00:29:10,129
ways you doing out

550
00:29:10,130 --> 00:29:13,300
email doing in a log file suffered

551
00:29:13,300 --> 00:29:18,630
user interfaces to pick a I'm will
swallow for the attacker further

552
00:29:18,630 --> 00:29:22,110
sorties you something which I I call the
doppelganger

553
00:29:22,110 --> 00:29:25,340
which is a way of denying access to real
news

554
00:29:25,340 --> 00:29:28,740
I'm so when you find something that's
attacker

555
00:29:28,740 --> 00:29:32,040
you you determine that is hostile
according to the system

556
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:35,600
we're going to do was going to reroute
any traffic from him only

557
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:39,730
on that was going to go to a real host
out to when these fake names

558
00:29:39,730 --> 00:29:42,960
so what you have and you know they made
specifically it's called a doppelganger

559
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:47,160
as we speak machines right I'm and
you're going to like the transition to

560
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:50,800
you going to do move him over to you
like the speakership now when he tries

561
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:51,580
to access

562
00:29:51,580 --> 00:29:55,530
on the rest so figure we catching like a
quarter the way through the scanning

563
00:29:55,530 --> 00:29:56,080
right

564
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:59,929
now the rest of the three quarters is
not gonna get any real notes

565
00:29:59,930 --> 00:30:03,510
even though now when he does trust and
relax can get rerouted traffic

566
00:30:03,510 --> 00:30:06,920
it's almost all the day isn't the same
as fake

567
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:10,360
I'm using it. tables magic to do this

568
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:14,040
from this injured

569
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:17,129
said that I'm so one important things 12
years make sure the

570
00:30:17,130 --> 00:30:21,120
information is different than the real
host so it's really easy thing to try to

571
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:22,030
say like all

572
00:30:22,030 --> 00:30:25,410
what we just make the real host I double
dare look the same in that way when he

573
00:30:25,410 --> 00:30:26,780
tries to exploit

574
00:30:26,780 --> 00:30:30,480
like some service that on there that'll
just be exporting the fake machine and

575
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:31,400
other real one

576
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:35,880
and that's it sounds good but like you
to resist out by saying we're not in IDS

577
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:37,870
right we don't wanna try to do that

578
00:30:37,870 --> 00:30:41,560
because then when you like you can find
out that a fake machine many

579
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:44,909
that's bad from our perspective we want
to do is provide

580
00:30:44,910 --> 00:30:50,640
different information on this is this
this feature is also possibly dangerous

581
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:54,660
um since any false positives then turn
into and I'll service

582
00:30:54,660 --> 00:30:57,900
it's like if your file server gets
determined as hostile that's not just a

583
00:30:57,900 --> 00:30:58,960
matter like your

584
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:02,580
I'm by your administrator getting like
an alert knowing alert

585
00:31:02,580 --> 00:31:05,860
the file server then diskette style
service tray like it all his traffic

586
00:31:05,860 --> 00:31:08,120
gets rerouted to these fake notes now
you got

587
00:31:08,120 --> 00:31:11,380
I'm so by default this feature is
disabled

588
00:31:11,380 --> 00:31:14,700
you also wanna like do things like
probably

589
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:17,880
increase the threshold the pasta cation
on him as well

590
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:21,900
on its really a few channels onto his
mother features them sing together

591
00:31:21,900 --> 00:31:23,130
quickly force

592
00:31:23,130 --> 00:31:26,810
I'm so like training like there's a wave
in band-like training system that press

593
00:31:26,810 --> 00:31:28,100
the train by

594
00:31:28,100 --> 00:31:31,740
I'm get through a bunch of the dance
sare all that trade holiday to you too

595
00:31:31,740 --> 00:31:33,230
saw was benign

596
00:31:33,230 --> 00:31:36,990
and it goes into the system region say
all actually I was and mapping in the

597
00:31:36,990 --> 00:31:40,380
middle there in this IP address was bad
he was in and maps Q

598
00:31:40,380 --> 00:31:43,970
but that is their data and you can train
system

599
00:31:43,970 --> 00:31:47,260
i'm too much for you eyes we've a web
interface

600
00:31:47,260 --> 00:31:50,690
the local QT interface and a terminal
thats interface through

601
00:31:50,690 --> 00:31:54,900
good for scripting a you can import
export trading day to somebody else gets

602
00:31:54,900 --> 00:31:57,170
to know you can like imported export

603
00:31:57,170 --> 00:32:00,510
actually highly multi-threaded and free
software force because

604
00:32:00,510 --> 00:32:03,850
use of force would go

605
00:32:03,850 --> 00:32:10,850
I'm not a demo

606
00:32:11,660 --> 00:32:12,340
realized

607
00:32:12,340 --> 00:32:16,800
talk take this

608
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:20,690
I was gonna fail miserably

609
00:32:20,690 --> 00:32:27,690
are alright so I've gots

610
00:32:28,810 --> 00:32:32,280
I am a few virtual machines running so I
got

611
00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:35,460
a a US concealed so got from

612
00:32:35,460 --> 00:32:38,560
a three virtual machines running those
to that are victims

613
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:42,629
is the names are victim 1 and hapless
victim to

614
00:32:42,630 --> 00:32:46,590
and and and and map guy hears takes like
a minute to run someone ago and started

615
00:32:46,590 --> 00:32:50,030
the side has a pretty to fall from Cape

616
00:32:50,030 --> 00:32:54,190
surprised if all options on a his reign
operating system

617
00:32:54,190 --> 00:32:57,660
scan Run with 0 is running the fuzzy

618
00:32:57,660 --> 00:33:01,560
option to say like try to guess the
operating system get it exactly since

619
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:05,240
an operator lee gets a hundred percent
result that is just as this

620
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:08,750
save it to an external file so we can
look at another you why

621
00:33:08,750 --> 00:33:12,860
and randomizing posts pretty normal to
I'm so he's doing some other things that

622
00:33:12,860 --> 00:33:14,120
worry we talked about before

623
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:17,770
stickball except seconds answers for
seizing up much are packets to try to

624
00:33:17,770 --> 00:33:18,020
find

625
00:33:18,010 --> 00:33:21,720
figure out what machines are out on this
virtual network have set up

626
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:25,770
bomb on my my laptop right now and he's
gonna do up

627
00:33:25,770 --> 00:33:29,040
defaults TCP port scan out some other

628
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:32,430
commonly used ports that are on machines
nominees

629
00:33:32,430 --> 00:33:36,350
going to looking operating systems see
we're offering sis was running

630
00:33:36,350 --> 00:33:39,850
I'm so this onto a before and after so
like this is the

631
00:33:39,850 --> 00:33:43,270
before so this can show you like what
can that work actually looks like on the

632
00:33:43,270 --> 00:33:44,480
900 apply for

633
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:51,480
tool that we haven't seen it looks like
rafter hopefully he will finish it

634
00:33:51,900 --> 00:33:53,050
usually takes like 70

635
00:33:53,050 --> 00:33:56,470
to you for four seconds another try this
before

636
00:33:56,470 --> 00:34:00,810
ago slicker

637
00:34:00,810 --> 00:34:03,990
the scenes and napkins and maps and I
saw front and for presentations like

638
00:34:03,990 --> 00:34:04,340
this

639
00:34:04,340 --> 00:34:08,550
so he's got a few a machines ace on this
network

640
00:34:08,550 --> 00:34:12,210
from 26 18 you don't want 62-56 one is
my

641
00:34:12,210 --> 00:34:15,850
laptop the host machine stock in that
buyers Surana whatever running

642
00:34:15,850 --> 00:34:19,650
I'm presence this is our chat server X
these guys you can see here running

643
00:34:19,650 --> 00:34:20,150
empathy

644
00:34:20,150 --> 00:34:24,370
and then 101 is himself

645
00:34:24,370 --> 00:34:28,639
so he doesn't see anything air suspect
writers Amy imports and 100's the bike

646
00:34:28,639 --> 00:34:30,210
default DHCP server

647
00:34:30,210 --> 00:34:34,159
the psych virtual boxing set up so he's
all the real machines

648
00:34:34,159 --> 00:34:38,230
from and was pretty easy is pretty
straightforward and he got all the real

649
00:34:38,230 --> 00:34:41,790
data and now you can start looking
deeper into the services and see where

650
00:34:41,790 --> 00:34:42,650
you can explain right

651
00:34:42,650 --> 00:34:49,650
so let's Ron is also like eyeball

652
00:34:52,510 --> 00:34:56,110
logo thing but since when does

653
00:34:56,110 --> 00:35:02,460
to logo's and saw for projects ever have
to make sense turn on

654
00:35:02,460 --> 00:35:06,040
system passable

655
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:13,040
data there cleared out and then I will
run the scan

656
00:35:13,260 --> 00:35:16,680
same time it will take a little bit
longer

657
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:20,319
I'm since he has a whole bunch of these
fake notes scans well

658
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:24,480
which kinda but as by design to write a
mean I'm taking a little bit longer

659
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:28,600
in this scam like making the attacker
take longer sending more packets

660
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:33,690
is definitely an advantage for us so we
should see actually freeh for the

661
00:35:33,690 --> 00:35:34,470
defender

662
00:35:34,470 --> 00:35:38,550
we should see this guy pick up on that
the bad guy

663
00:35:38,550 --> 00:35:42,310
some point in the hill large probably
show biz green first I'm green means

664
00:35:42,310 --> 00:35:45,759
these detectives benign arms system has
to get a few

665
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:49,700
packets a bit more information for all
finally come to the conclusion that is

666
00:35:49,700 --> 00:35:50,360
bouncing

667
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:53,990
you know tries to be nice to people
before I'm figuring out the bad

668
00:35:53,990 --> 00:35:57,920
I'm sorry popped up their screen POS and
that tends to like

669
00:35:57,920 --> 00:36:01,110
first packets this it's really bursty
for some reason doesn't like sand

670
00:36:01,110 --> 00:36:06,090
packets like really evenly throughout
for some reason sources and easy options

671
00:36:06,090 --> 00:36:07,330
like make it less per city

672
00:36:07,330 --> 00:36:10,960
senator makes it all the more
entertaining to watch in demo cassettes

673
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:12,470
like watching a blinking cursor right
now

674
00:36:12,470 --> 00:36:19,470
by just patrol talk over it to I

675
00:36:23,470 --> 00:36:30,470
could you repeat that

676
00:36:31,930 --> 00:36:37,230
can I try I miss that kite tried what to
eat no

677
00:36:37,230 --> 00:36:44,230
thinkin quite understand the question

678
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:51,830
still running sky still running

679
00:36:51,830 --> 00:36:55,330
should come with something more
interesting to talk about what's going

680
00:36:55,330 --> 00:36:55,680
on

681
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:59,220
with areas if I like it was red i guess
i maps was

682
00:36:59,220 --> 00:37:02,280
coming to the Enders scanning so he a

683
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:05,400
like I said we have a system that comes
up with a number between 0&1 were zero

684
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:06,840
is almost surely benign and

685
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:10,290
one is almost really hostile so here's a
appoint 911

686
00:37:10,290 --> 00:37:14,480
something on so it's pretty hostile

687
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:21,480
in the sky still finishing up scanning
now and in a minute

688
00:37:21,670 --> 00:37:28,670
finish a play it's like a show the
results

689
00:37:32,910 --> 00:37:39,339
these guys can still talk by the way in
like if you're lucky

690
00:37:39,339 --> 00:37:46,339
a pop up and say

691
00:37:52,660 --> 00:37:56,170
you can read that

692
00:37:56,170 --> 00:38:03,170
them

693
00:38:08,690 --> 00:38:12,960
talk to myself RM absecon while I wanna
fuck Inc

694
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:16,680
if I cancel those discussed all look at
their output XML

695
00:38:16,680 --> 00:38:22,350
were free to do that Charlotte ago

696
00:38:22,350 --> 00:38:28,230
tougher taking longer

697
00:38:28,230 --> 00:38:31,460
sissy routes not doing a trace route so

698
00:38:31,460 --> 00:38:34,880
tree struck triggered by the way takes a
long time and time try to run

699
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:38,800
trace rats can by the doubles are more
Europe you're scanning time for some

700
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:39,710
reason well I'm

701
00:38:39,710 --> 00:38:42,690
now for some reason it was asked to go
through all the different hops doing up

702
00:38:42,690 --> 00:38:43,630
the presentation her

703
00:38:43,630 --> 00:38:49,640
up the connection well I think I look
for some other

704
00:38:49,640 --> 00:38:53,120
um configuration options and here the so
I can go into

705
00:38:53,120 --> 00:38:56,440
preferences for system and so you can

706
00:38:56,440 --> 00:38:59,830
the define a ser profiles

707
00:38:59,830 --> 00:39:03,900
I'm here hopefully you guys can see
what's on screen I'm so you can define

708
00:39:03,900 --> 00:39:06,120
like operating system whatever rights we
have like a

709
00:39:06,120 --> 00:39:10,000
when xserver and you can get what you
cannot vendor you want she could set the

710
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:10,310
agenda

711
00:39:10,310 --> 00:39:13,730
under 68 clear and here's though

712
00:39:13,730 --> 00:39:17,720
like a huge database that we found a bug
you can add vendors shoes I want safe

713
00:39:17,720 --> 00:39:18,930
secure base

714
00:39:18,930 --> 00:39:22,819
machine right useselect and that'll
happen first

715
00:39:22,820 --> 00:39:25,970
I'm 3 I think bytes it is of the

716
00:39:25,970 --> 00:39:29,710
the first half of the mac Address is the
vendor area analyst that those

717
00:39:29,710 --> 00:39:33,510
second half it is just random for the
individual device as it'll take the

718
00:39:33,510 --> 00:39:35,740
first half as a shirt is a secure base

719
00:39:35,740 --> 00:39:40,020
vendor right and the disk if you're an
actor so you can specify it from there

720
00:39:40,020 --> 00:39:43,580
you can set drop rates you can say like
I want just pretend to be a wifi link

721
00:39:43,580 --> 00:39:44,009
that

722
00:39:44,010 --> 00:39:47,850
dropped 16 percent all the packets to go
buy it I'm

723
00:39:47,850 --> 00:39:51,589
I am to look at

724
00:39:51,590 --> 00:39:56,180
operating system supports and stuff like
that she can set

725
00:39:56,180 --> 00:39:59,540
but what ports are open since I just
this I want like a particular part be

726
00:39:59,540 --> 00:40:00,450
open or closed

727
00:40:00,450 --> 00:40:07,450
actual service running on it here's the
operating system

728
00:40:08,010 --> 00:40:11,150
so somewhere for this is the and map OST
be

729
00:40:11,150 --> 00:40:14,660
comes you can pretend to be any
operating system that on here so

730
00:40:14,660 --> 00:40:18,270
this is like a lot of offering since
pretty much like every device it's ever

731
00:40:18,270 --> 00:40:19,060
been made ever

732
00:40:19,060 --> 00:40:22,610
as IBM like a i ax like every version

733
00:40:22,610 --> 00:40:25,790
sir it's ever been made by them or

734
00:40:25,790 --> 00:40:29,580
Kodak Kodak makes 20 printers course
right and network printers

735
00:40:29,580 --> 00:40:36,580
I'm I think

736
00:40:37,290 --> 00:40:43,430
and map is like frozen or something I
was just what's the 22 minutes remaining

737
00:40:43,430 --> 00:40:44,129
ones are doing

738
00:40:44,130 --> 00:40:50,330
arianna I know are so I'm gonna cancel
I'm gonna run for 20 minutes Seaford

739
00:40:50,330 --> 00:40:53,430
now dan didn't save a file

740
00:40:53,430 --> 00:40:57,330
art so I'm gonna go and I try this again

741
00:40:57,330 --> 00:41:00,590
and I'm scared continuing to come back
to it and so I can show you the results

742
00:41:00,590 --> 00:41:00,890
for

743
00:41:00,890 --> 00:41:04,330
I of all the things I could feel it and
think that an applicant in 10 shell

744
00:41:04,330 --> 00:41:11,330
correct was not patsy

745
00:41:17,010 --> 00:41:20,540
I think I only have yet might have a
questions and contact information so I

746
00:41:20,540 --> 00:41:20,930
got

747
00:41:20,930 --> 00:41:23,940
from my email address obvious you're
into

748
00:41:23,940 --> 00:41:27,750
like social networks over Twitter &
account for diaspora

749
00:41:27,750 --> 00:41:31,140
that sort of thing are are saw for
project

750
00:41:31,140 --> 00:41:35,420
website again is out a project without
word on our actual source codes upon get

751
00:41:35,420 --> 00:41:35,950
help

752
00:41:35,950 --> 00:41:39,430
get up slashed a soft on company I work
for do this with

753
00:41:39,430 --> 00:41:43,450
on and on RC like I'm coming at us up
anytime

754
00:41:43,450 --> 00:41:47,480
marciano RTC channel Nova and ever want
to see me in person

755
00:41:47,480 --> 00:41:50,730
I mean Phoenix 2600 to meet %uh First
Fridays

756
00:41:50,730 --> 00:41:54,700
our meeting spots archive influx a lot
lately so I'm just go to the website

757
00:41:54,700 --> 00:41:58,530
on PHX 2600 .org to you on figure out

758
00:41:58,530 --> 00:42:01,940
we're at and okay into two questions

759
00:42:01,940 --> 00:42:05,570
do you like crazy and a shout out I saw
a hand

760
00:42:05,570 --> 00:42:12,570
okay

761
00:42:14,010 --> 00:42:17,850
now the questions like do you agree with
DHCP so we can like white list of hosts

762
00:42:17,850 --> 00:42:21,569
on we do away with a feature on that's
based off love static

763
00:42:21,570 --> 00:42:24,540
Roger addresses turn into the current
incarnation the jewel I'm you can give

764
00:42:24,540 --> 00:42:25,870
no whitelist on an address

765
00:42:25,870 --> 00:42:29,350
say this progress is good like don't you
know do anything about to the file

766
00:42:29,350 --> 00:42:29,819
server

767
00:42:29,820 --> 00:42:34,540
but it's not tied to GCB I'm so we could
actually go also given a mac Address

768
00:42:34,540 --> 00:42:38,210
on the equally I think I'd be good
feature actually on so currently the

769
00:42:38,210 --> 00:42:38,890
whitelisting

770
00:42:38,890 --> 00:42:45,890
all abilities basil I P assault and here

771
00:42:48,680 --> 00:42:54,779
in

772
00:42:54,780 --> 00:42:57,330
this the questions about or liked or
like you know

773
00:42:57,330 --> 00:43:01,049
I think urban is it or is like how it is
on your system react

774
00:43:01,050 --> 00:43:08,050
around react to or integrate with two or
perhaps yeah

775
00:43:16,319 --> 00:43:19,099
this so I guess just brought workout is
our system mentor

776
00:43:19,099 --> 00:43:23,359
lycra later in tracked I'm anger just
fairly different fundamentally liked or

777
00:43:23,359 --> 00:43:25,009
isn't necessarily about reconnaissance

778
00:43:25,010 --> 00:43:28,349
stores just about I'm trying to hide

779
00:43:28,349 --> 00:43:32,740
like the original location your data so
it's Micah privacy tool

780
00:43:32,740 --> 00:43:36,510
I'm whereas like I don't think that
necessarily relates much to

781
00:43:36,510 --> 00:43:40,549
major Constance here

782
00:43:40,549 --> 00:43:44,480
I'm so I know that company de

783
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:47,549
I'm has been run with as many as a
thousand 24

784
00:43:47,549 --> 00:43:51,180
notes on a single computer arm and of
course that's going to pound on

785
00:43:51,180 --> 00:43:54,940
how fast your computer is on this offer
itself can handle at least a few

786
00:43:54,940 --> 00:43:55,470
thousand

787
00:43:55,470 --> 00:43:59,049
I'll reply personally done um are

788
00:43:59,049 --> 00:44:02,609
any

789
00:44:02,609 --> 00:44:07,940
armor sees a lovely running it on ARM

790
00:44:07,940 --> 00:44:11,140
other data software running on our own
I'm internal like corporate

791
00:44:11,140 --> 00:44:15,240
internet and we have probably about a
hundred and sweet you know half probably

792
00:44:15,240 --> 00:44:16,859
about a hundred fake nose as well

793
00:44:16,859 --> 00:44:21,190
and you know networks reasonably well

794
00:44:21,190 --> 00:44:25,049
though the there's this fun ways of us
I'm a working our system like we

795
00:44:25,049 --> 00:44:28,770
we accidentally we're running a test
network and we would like

796
00:44:28,770 --> 00:44:33,130
getting new I we've renovate find a new
mac address that we do see p for it

797
00:44:33,130 --> 00:44:36,180
and we would like start and stop this
whole buncha times were quickly ran out

798
00:44:36,180 --> 00:44:37,410
of disk allegations

799
00:44:37,410 --> 00:44:40,730
arms that was annoying was a few things
like that in a week we have to watch out

800
00:44:40,730 --> 00:44:41,020
for

801
00:44:41,020 --> 00:44:48,020
yes sir because

802
00:44:50,119 --> 00:44:53,480
I'm so that the questions like how much
bottleneck is the approximate nearest

803
00:44:53,480 --> 00:44:55,279
neighbors like Lost cation algorithm

804
00:44:55,279 --> 00:44:58,359
I mean that's a big bottleneck in terms
of computational on

805
00:44:58,359 --> 00:45:02,359
ability right since Aug that's like a
pretty heavy duty thing

806
00:45:02,359 --> 00:45:06,029
when she start talking about like the 12
dimensional space

807
00:45:06,029 --> 00:45:09,630
thousands of data points this becomes a
really crazy thing on

808
00:45:09,630 --> 00:45:13,369
and it can be paralyzed to a certain
extent so that's really helpful

809
00:45:13,369 --> 00:45:16,680
but in by in our current tests I'm we
wanna

810
00:45:16,680 --> 00:45:19,720
with on a large bottle neck just like
capturing data

811
00:45:19,720 --> 00:45:24,020
it turns out that like having to run CPU
cycles on every packet

812
00:45:24,020 --> 00:45:27,549
on when you're receiving like Gigabit
Ethernet or more right

813
00:45:27,549 --> 00:45:31,440
don't be a really limiting factor so it
Houston the software testing done our

814
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:32,039
software

815
00:45:32,039 --> 00:45:35,510
in practice it's been the packet
capturing that the bottleneck

816
00:45:35,510 --> 00:45:39,349
on this post the cost occasion though in
anticipation that we do is we have a

817
00:45:39,349 --> 00:45:41,609
class cation timeouts we say what's only
do it

818
00:45:41,609 --> 00:45:45,538
like once every five seconds cost cation
or maybe what only do it like every

819
00:45:45,539 --> 00:45:46,910
second and that's configurable

820
00:45:46,910 --> 00:45:53,910
question here me

821
00:46:03,540 --> 00:46:05,920
as the question was like I'm if I can't
act was able to get

822
00:46:05,920 --> 00:46:08,900
I'm not your arc data and see like all
the arcade it was coming from one

823
00:46:08,900 --> 00:46:09,450
machine

824
00:46:09,450 --> 00:46:13,030
bike with a like would not coming anyway
I'm so the

825
00:46:13,030 --> 00:46:17,740
out the machines ago by better at when
you when you request like in our

826
00:46:17,740 --> 00:46:20,930
when you are requesting a new

827
00:46:20,930 --> 00:46:24,180
IP address right like case cuz for you
deviated

828
00:46:24,180 --> 00:46:27,440
the a DHCP arm %uh of it

829
00:46:27,440 --> 00:46:30,280
Fig missions have their own Mac
addresses and so if you're just looking

830
00:46:30,280 --> 00:46:31,100
at data

831
00:46:31,100 --> 00:46:34,400
I'm their to appear to be different
machines like they want all be appearing

832
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:35,900
to be coming from one source

833
00:46:35,900 --> 00:46:40,490
unless you how like several wiretaps
across the network right are able to see

834
00:46:40,490 --> 00:46:41,240
every link

835
00:46:41,240 --> 00:46:44,750
and actually see our will all these
machines actually are following all down

836
00:46:44,750 --> 00:46:45,610
to this one guy

837
00:46:45,610 --> 00:46:49,040
on which point then maybe the solution
is to not run

838
00:46:49,040 --> 00:46:52,680
you know Nova once in one place but to
run into several different locations

839
00:46:52,680 --> 00:46:59,680
route to a question for you

840
00:47:03,330 --> 00:47:10,330
p

841
00:47:15,819 --> 00:47:18,890
I'm can we that's the question as I can
to can we detect

842
00:47:18,890 --> 00:47:23,190
a fake machine like traffic analysis i'm
peter is you saying I come

843
00:47:23,190 --> 00:47:25,819
havana can an attacker tell the
difference between a real no fake

844
00:47:25,819 --> 00:47:26,380
machine

845
00:47:26,380 --> 00:47:29,940
base of traffic houses so one of the
things we don't have right now

846
00:47:29,940 --> 00:47:33,700
that we arm as a feature in the future
is I'm to make

847
00:47:33,700 --> 00:47:36,940
like data like ShopRite like to have
these fake notes

848
00:47:36,940 --> 00:47:43,940
sending data out amongst one another
also may be too fake machines

849
00:47:52,859 --> 00:47:56,340
oh I see what you mean like some like
the figures in houses like that they're

850
00:47:56,340 --> 00:47:56,830
saying

851
00:47:56,830 --> 00:48:00,250
data back to the attack right maybe
there's a latency involved with it like

852
00:48:00,250 --> 00:48:04,730
maybe like the fake machines like how 10
some other signature I got I'm

853
00:48:04,730 --> 00:48:07,920
I we tried to look for that right I mean
but like bike

854
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:10,850
kinda definition is only so much that I
can do on SATs the sort of thing that

855
00:48:10,850 --> 00:48:12,160
we're hoping to get from the community

856
00:48:12,160 --> 00:48:15,670
is like maybe there is some super easy
thing like half a second

857
00:48:15,670 --> 00:48:19,160
place is always added on: from over fake
notes and that's that smaller billy

858
00:48:19,160 --> 00:48:20,830
wright that would be bad if that were
true

859
00:48:20,830 --> 00:48:24,779
I'm susser I can't give you any par de
sac know that isn't true

860
00:48:24,780 --> 00:48:29,210
but yeah hopefully we can get a some
from the crowd actually see for

861
00:48:29,210 --> 00:48:36,210
you see really quick at this and mapping
finished

862
00:48:41,790 --> 00:48:48,790
nasty all that matters art so nice

863
00:48:50,700 --> 00:48:56,020
no I think I turned Art Walk

864
00:48:56,020 --> 00:49:03,020
assault she's my time

865
00:49:03,680 --> 00:49:03,930
are

866
00:49:03,910 --> 00:49:06,578
and I think it's all you have time for
talk
