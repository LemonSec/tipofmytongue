8
00:02:01,039 --> 00:02:02,049
Catherine Crump

9
00:02:02,049 --> 00:02:06,319
who is a staff attorney in that project
and by John Ryan stay in the long time

10
00:02:06,319 --> 00:02:09,140
legal director and I've ACLU of
Massachusetts

11
00:02:09,140 --> 00:02:12,750
our I will start with some general
remarks

12
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:17,480
about leaks and national security weeks
and the Obama administration's pursued

13
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:22,340
I've leakers and John will then speak a
little bit about the grand jury process

14
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:24,230
and in particular the WikiLeaks

15
00:02:24,230 --> 00:02:28,819
criminal grand jury and Catherine will
talk about some of the ACLU's work

16
00:02:28,819 --> 00:02:32,269
representing people who have been
harassed

17
00:02:32,269 --> 00:02:35,959
and through having their laptop search

18
00:02:35,959 --> 00:02:39,840
at airports through having their social
media accounts

19
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:44,910
subpoenaed in connection and with the
Obama administration's very aggressive

20
00:02:44,910 --> 00:02:46,230
pursuit have

21
00:02:46,230 --> 00:02:50,819
whistleblowers but I would be remiss if
I didn't acknowledge before we start

22
00:02:50,819 --> 00:02:54,680
that we have in the front row I wanted
the bravest

23
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:57,850
national security whistleblowers who
many have you heard from earlier before

24
00:02:57,850 --> 00:03:04,850
Bill Bailey who was at the NSA so I just
want to acknowledge him to bits

25
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:12,170
so as I said I'm gonna start with some
general background and

26
00:03:12,170 --> 00:03:16,690
and I Catherine John Wall add substance
to it so

27
00:03:16,690 --> 00:03:19,790
you get the red meat first and then you
eat your vegetables second

28
00:03:19,790 --> 00:03:23,220
I'm you any conversation about

29
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:27,390
this topic about national security
whistleblowers has to begin with what I

30
00:03:27,390 --> 00:03:28,490
think is the most scandalous

31
00:03:28,490 --> 00:03:32,470
active all and that is there has been in
this country not not a single

32
00:03:32,470 --> 00:03:33,460
prosecution

33
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:38,680
for torture or illegal spying I'm not
withstanding the terrible crimes that

34
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:39,460
were committed

35
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:42,970
I here over the last decade and yet
there have been several

36
00:03:42,970 --> 00:03:46,560
prosecutions for leaking about torture

37
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:50,720
and illegal spying on where that the
only bad facts

38
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:55,550
it would be bad enough but the reality
is even most leaks

39
00:03:55,550 --> 00:04:00,210
about torture an illegal spying and
drone strikes and cyberattacks

40
00:04:00,210 --> 00:04:05,950
are not prosecuted either and that's
because the vast majority of those leaks

41
00:04:05,950 --> 00:04:09,020
com from the administration that is in
power

42
00:04:09,020 --> 00:04:12,430
and most leagues are not intended to
expose

43
00:04:12,430 --> 00:04:16,579
government wrongdoing there instead
government efforts to shape

44
00:04:16,579 --> 00:04:20,459
and manipulate the public debate about
these critical issues

45
00:04:20,459 --> 00:04:23,530
so even as the Obama administration

46
00:04:23,530 --> 00:04:27,380
has brought an unprecedented number
atlee prosecutions

47
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:32,100
it has simultaneously provided to
favorite reporters like bob woodward

48
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:36,890
vast amounts a classified and so-called
national defense information

49
00:04:36,890 --> 00:04:41,340
for the production of news reports and
books that would put the administration

50
00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:46,230
in a better light so we have the
misconduct itself that is not prosecuted

51
00:04:46,230 --> 00:04:50,420
we have the sanctioned leaks about the
misconduct that are not prosecuted

52
00:04:50,420 --> 00:04:54,750
and the only people who are prosecuted
are those who leak

53
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:59,490
information without the consent or
direction the administration in power

54
00:04:59,490 --> 00:05:02,980
the truth is until quite

55
00:05:02,980 --> 00:05:06,800
relatively recently in our history even
though is

56
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:11,310
un sanction leaks were not prosecuted
are very very rarely prosecuted

57
00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:16,169
if you were to listen only to their
frequent in growing demands by members

58
00:05:16,169 --> 00:05:18,919
of congress that we Kors be ferreted out
and punished

59
00:05:18,919 --> 00:05:22,280
you might think that the laws
surrounding

60
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:25,390
leaks to the press were firmly
established

61
00:05:25,390 --> 00:05:28,990
that really is not sell at the truth is
that those laws

62
00:05:28,990 --> 00:05:32,419
are remarkably unsettled and the region
those laws

63
00:05:32,419 --> 00:05:35,770
is remarkably unsettled the most
frequently

64
00:05:35,770 --> 00:05:40,210
involved law in this context is
something called the Espionage Act which

65
00:05:40,210 --> 00:05:41,049
was enacted

66
00:05:41,050 --> 00:05:44,880
in the world war 1 era there is no
question

67
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:48,490
that that long applies to traditional
espionage

68
00:05:48,490 --> 00:05:53,229
that is people selling secrets are
providing information to a foreign power

69
00:05:53,229 --> 00:05:58,190
but i think is less known is that for
nearly seventy years

70
00:05:58,190 --> 00:06:02,919
after the Espionage Act was enacted not
a single person

71
00:06:02,919 --> 00:06:06,310
was convicted for leaking government
secrets

72
00:06:06,310 --> 00:06:10,729
to the press in fact in 1979

73
00:06:10,729 --> 00:06:15,690
the CIA's general counsel testified to
Congress

74
00:06:15,690 --> 00:06:19,919
that he could not even say for certain
whether leaks to the press were

75
00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:21,060
prohibited by law

76
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:25,789
he testified that if the espionage made
it a crime to disclose the secrets to

77
00:06:25,789 --> 00:06:26,560
the press

78
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:31,210
then in his words we have had in this
country for the last 60 years

79
00:06:31,210 --> 00:06:36,729
and absolutely unprecedented crime wave
because surely there have been thousands

80
00:06:36,729 --> 00:06:40,349
upon thousands upon authorize
disclosures of classified information

81
00:06:40,350 --> 00:06:43,760
all criminal acts in the justice
department's view and yet none has ever

82
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:44,860
been prosecuted

83
00:06:44,860 --> 00:06:50,560
this was in 1979 it would be hard to
imagine a CIA lawyer saying anything

84
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:51,160
like that

85
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:54,390
today at the text love

86
00:06:54,390 --> 00:06:57,390
the Espionage Act itself certainly

87
00:06:57,390 --> 00:07:00,820
appears to permit prosecution at leakers

88
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:04,300
up but some kind of consensus had
developed I

89
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:07,990
in those seventy years that it would not
be used in that manner

90
00:07:07,990 --> 00:07:11,539
I in fact until President Obama took
office

91
00:07:11,539 --> 00:07:15,390
there had been a total of three
prosecutions leakers

92
00:07:15,390 --> 00:07:18,530
in the history of the United States one
was daniel ellsberg

93
00:07:18,530 --> 00:07:20,970
and as you all know that one fell apart
because at the nixon administration's

94
00:07:20,970 --> 00:07:22,650
law-breaking

95
00:07:22,650 --> 00:07:25,960
another with someone named Samuel
Morrison who leaked the photo to Jane's

96
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:27,090
Defence Weekly

97
00:07:27,090 --> 00:07:30,810
he was pardoned by president clinton he
served only a short prison sentence

98
00:07:30,810 --> 00:07:34,200
and a third was someone who served a
year in prison for leaking

99
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:38,490
documents from the DEA at that was the
whole history of prosecution

100
00:07:38,490 --> 00:07:42,090
leakers until President Obama took
office are ready

101
00:07:42,090 --> 00:07:45,210
the Obama administration has indicted 6

102
00:07:45,210 --> 00:07:48,430
individuals in connection with leaks to
the press double

103
00:07:48,430 --> 00:07:51,650
the entire history before I and perhaps

104
00:07:51,650 --> 00:07:56,330
in a Q&A afterwards we can all speculate
as to why that may be and let me just by

105
00:07:56,330 --> 00:07:59,039
now as you probably know there is a
microphone in the front

106
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:02,170
will leave plenty of time for questions
and I hope that

107
00:08:02,170 --> 00:08:05,250
you will have some for us

108
00:08:05,250 --> 00:08:09,450
so the Obama administration has made
very clear in its words and actions

109
00:08:09,450 --> 00:08:12,870
that it does not distinguish between
spies who

110
00:08:12,870 --> 00:08:17,100
sell secrets to foreign agents and
patriotic whistleblowers

111
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:20,230
who leak secrets about misconduct to the
press

112
00:08:20,230 --> 00:08:23,250
in fact in a recent filing in one case
involving the

113
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:28,450
prosecution a former CIA agent the prom
dresses took the remarkable position

114
00:08:28,450 --> 00:08:32,289
that leads to the press and I'm calling
their brief may be viewed as more

115
00:08:32,289 --> 00:08:33,419
pernicious

116
00:08:33,419 --> 00:08:37,319
and the typical espionage case where a
spy cells classified information for

117
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:38,349
money

118
00:08:38,349 --> 00:08:42,459
and the gunman reason that unlike the
typical espionage case

119
00:08:42,459 --> 00:08:45,450
where a single foreign country or
intelligence agency may be the

120
00:08:45,450 --> 00:08:46,579
beneficiary

121
00:08:46,579 --> 00:08:49,620
and the unauthorized disclosure of
classified information

122
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:52,660
this defendant a man in Jeffrey sterling

123
00:08:52,660 --> 00:08:55,910
elected to the club disclose the
classmen information publicly through

124
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:56,930
the mass media

125
00:08:56,930 --> 00:09:00,600
thats every for an adversary stood to
benefit from the defendant's

126
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:03,150
unauthorized disclosure of classified
information

127
00:09:03,150 --> 00:09:07,699
that's posing an even greater threat to
society of course not mentioned here

128
00:09:07,699 --> 00:09:11,199
as the other people who receive this
information with the american people who

129
00:09:11,199 --> 00:09:12,500
had been in the dark

130
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:15,790
about very serious government misconduct

131
00:09:15,790 --> 00:09:18,980
so the old consensus that I would too II

132
00:09:18,980 --> 00:09:23,220
that leaks to the press would generally
not be prosecuted as espionage

133
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:26,570
appears now to have collapsed entirely

134
00:09:26,570 --> 00:09:30,380
our second much deeper and more hallowed
consensus

135
00:09:30,380 --> 00:09:33,610
and that is that publishers a government
secret

136
00:09:33,610 --> 00:09:37,900
will not be prosecuted is showing some
signs

137
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:43,000
have strained at least since the
Pentagon Papers case

138
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,459
the working consensus between reporters
in the government has been that the

139
00:09:46,459 --> 00:09:48,510
first amendment would not permit

140
00:09:48,510 --> 00:09:53,209
a publisher to be prosecuted for the
publication a government secrets

141
00:09:53,209 --> 00:09:56,839
but the Obama administration has been
quite clear that is investigating

142
00:09:56,839 --> 00:09:57,980
WikiLeaks

143
00:09:57,980 --> 00:10:01,050
with an eye toward possible criminal
prosecution

144
00:10:01,050 --> 00:10:04,910
and John will talk a little bit about
that I in a moment

145
00:10:04,910 --> 00:10:07,290
let me just say here that such a
prosecution would be utterly

146
00:10:07,290 --> 00:10:09,370
unprecedented in our history

147
00:10:09,370 --> 00:10:13,150
I it's hard to overstate how much
reporting and not just investigative

148
00:10:13,150 --> 00:10:14,110
reporting

149
00:10:14,110 --> 00:10:17,839
relies on include classified information
especially

150
00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:22,120
reporting on matters of national
security foreign policy in one piece

151
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:25,430
and the government has never attempted
to prosecute a publisher of leaked

152
00:10:25,430 --> 00:10:26,770
documents

153
00:10:26,770 --> 00:10:30,410
in fact it has never successfully
prosecuted anyone

154
00:10:30,410 --> 00:10:34,490
under the Espionage Act or related
statutes who is neither employees

155
00:10:34,490 --> 00:10:37,820
and the government with privileged
access to that information

156
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:40,829
or an agent of a foreign government that
is a spy

157
00:10:40,829 --> 00:10:44,000
there was one attempt to do that but
that prosecution collapsed

158
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:48,000
and it's not hard to understand why the
government would be

159
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:53,430
or perhaps will be hi if they I carry
through with this investigation

160
00:10:53,430 --> 00:10:57,300
they would be hard-pressed to articulate
a theory of criminal liability

161
00:10:57,300 --> 00:11:00,940
that would hold WikiLeaks liable but
would exempt

162
00:11:00,940 --> 00:11:04,220
The Guardian newspaper or the New York
Times

163
00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:07,640
publishers that have published exactly
the same material and I would say that

164
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:08,880
arguably

165
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:12,430
the New York Times should perhaps be an
even greater jeopardy

166
00:11:12,430 --> 00:11:15,839
then with the weeks because the new york
times as a US entity

167
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:20,860
if we think about applying reciprocity
but we want to allow China or Iran

168
00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:24,260
or some other country to prosecute the
new york times for publishing their

169
00:11:24,260 --> 00:11:26,709
secrets

170
00:11:26,709 --> 00:11:29,990
prosecution wiki weeks or join us on G+

171
00:11:29,990 --> 00:11:33,300
would be a major threat to investigative
journalism

172
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:37,650
but not a major threat two weeks now let
me acknowledge here

173
00:11:37,650 --> 00:11:42,430
up before passing this on to my
colleagues that there are very difficult

174
00:11:42,430 --> 00:11:45,770
legal questions involved in this issue

175
00:11:45,770 --> 00:11:48,920
there are more than three million
Americans now who hold some kind of

176
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:50,670
security clearance

177
00:11:50,670 --> 00:11:54,160
the courts and the government will never
tolerate a rule

178
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:57,279
that allows each one of those person
people

179
00:11:57,279 --> 00:12:00,610
at to decide for himself which secrets
are worth keeping

180
00:12:00,610 --> 00:12:04,630
and which ones are not in general on the
other hand

181
00:12:04,630 --> 00:12:08,100
allowing the national security state
itself to shaping

182
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:12,510
and manipulate the public debate by
selectively leaking in prosecuting

183
00:12:12,510 --> 00:12:15,930
is a threat to democratic government it
can't be that

184
00:12:15,930 --> 00:12:19,050
any executive branch official with a

185
00:12:19,050 --> 00:12:23,640
classifications stamp can unilaterally
cover up critical information

186
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:27,149
about war and peace and government
scandal

187
00:12:27,149 --> 00:12:31,089
so what is the proper balance between
these competing values

188
00:12:31,089 --> 00:12:34,170
let me close my portion and this
presentation

189
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:37,209
with a few principles I that I believe

190
00:12:37,210 --> 00:12:41,020
reflect the requirements at the First
Amendment but at a minimum

191
00:12:41,020 --> 00:12:45,180
are a guide the wise exercise at the
government's prosecutorial discretion in

192
00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:46,420
this area

193
00:12:46,420 --> 00:12:49,430
the first principle is that publishers
have leaked information

194
00:12:49,430 --> 00:12:52,830
and here I would absolutely emphatically
include WikiLeaks

195
00:12:52,830 --> 00:12:57,140
should never be prosecuted for the
publication a truthful information

196
00:12:57,140 --> 00:13:00,390
particularly because so much of the
media is reporting is based on

197
00:13:00,390 --> 00:13:05,060
authorized leaks subjecting the press to
prosecution for the reporting a

198
00:13:05,060 --> 00:13:09,430
unauthorized leaks would guarantee at
the only story the government wants to

199
00:13:09,430 --> 00:13:09,940
tell

200
00:13:09,940 --> 00:13:13,660
sorry that only the story the government
wants to tell is available in part to

201
00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:15,250
the public discourse

202
00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:18,610
second principle whistleblowers

203
00:13:18,610 --> 00:13:22,040
who disclose information relating to the
government's waste

204
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:26,839
fraud corruption or illegal activities

205
00:13:26,839 --> 00:13:30,529
should not be prosecuted the leakers
interest in disclosing that information

206
00:13:30,529 --> 00:13:34,450
and more importantly the public's
interest in knowing that information

207
00:13:34,450 --> 00:13:38,560
categorically outweighs the government's
interest in secrecy

208
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:42,120
third principle disclosure i've other
government secrets

209
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:46,339
should be prosecuted only on a showing
that the harm to national security and

210
00:13:46,339 --> 00:13:48,360
real harm not speculative harm

211
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:52,610
outweighs the value to public discourse
that the information is disclosed

212
00:13:52,610 --> 00:13:56,149
because have so much wind spread over
classification the fact that information

213
00:13:56,149 --> 00:13:57,540
is classified

214
00:13:57,540 --> 00:14:01,779
is insufficient on its own to prove that
disclosure would be harmful

215
00:14:01,779 --> 00:14:05,660
and finally and this goes back to the
point that I started with

216
00:14:05,660 --> 00:14:09,110
leakers who are subjected to any kinda
prosecution should be able to defend

217
00:14:09,110 --> 00:14:12,500
themselves on the grounds have selective
enforcement

218
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:15,660
to the extent that the government
chooses to prosecute only disfavored

219
00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:19,089
leaks were systematically failing to
prosecute many hundreds of weeks that

220
00:14:19,089 --> 00:14:21,190
advance the government's agenda

221
00:14:21,190 --> 00:14:25,040
the government is unconstitutionally
enforcing the law to discriminate

222
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:29,599
against dissenting viewpoints I'm gonna
stop here and turn it over to John and

223
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:32,430
Catherine to as ice and add a little
more substance

224
00:14:32,430 --> 00:14:39,430
and then we'll be happy to take your
questions yeah sure that's great

225
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:44,660
in

226
00:14:44,660 --> 00:14:47,790
and and inheritor who

227
00:14:47,790 --> 00:14:50,949
yeah okay 1

228
00:14:50,950 --> 00:14:54,110
made it it doesn't show anything

229
00:14:54,110 --> 00:14:57,400
her on and lead

230
00:14:57,400 --> 00:15:02,580
Benz the presentation we which do I
didn't think it was Agri

231
00:15:02,580 --> 00:15:06,540
hun was cast as you'll note deeply in
the subjunctive

232
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:09,620
a in should would

233
00:15:09,620 --> 00:15:13,500
ought to a but that's all we are what we
are

234
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:18,710
we are in a position where the there are
specific guarantees is the the first

235
00:15:18,710 --> 00:15:19,300
amendment

236
00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:22,990
but their application has really yet to
be

237
00:15:22,990 --> 00:15:27,200
tested articulated by the courts
particularly in this situation

238
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:30,400
and her it's important to remember that

239
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:33,430
all this comes forward under
circumstances

240
00:15:33,430 --> 00:15:36,750
the who we're the federal

241
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:41,640
criminal justice system is heavily
stacked in favor the government

242
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:44,720
heavily heavily stacked in terms

243
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:48,590
love both the resources that are
available to the government to

244
00:15:48,590 --> 00:15:51,070
investigate into prosecute the

245
00:15:51,070 --> 00:15:54,190
and the constraints that are placed on
the Judiciary

246
00:15:54,190 --> 00:15:57,760
in controlling what prosecutors do a we
talked

247
00:15:57,760 --> 00:16:00,910
begin by talking about the
first-amendment

248
00:16:00,910 --> 00:16:04,850
the which ben is talked about and
cather's can talk a little bit about the

249
00:16:04,850 --> 00:16:05,720
fourth amendment

250
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:09,320
%ah but there are other amendments which

251
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:14,250
which contained what there was thought
to be an important safeguard nets the

252
00:16:14,250 --> 00:16:16,200
fifth amendment the very first prepare

253
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:20,460
the sends the fifth amendment that says
that no person

254
00:16:20,460 --> 00:16:23,740
should be held to answer the

255
00:16:23,740 --> 00:16:26,860
for hey capital or otherwise

256
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:31,870
infamous crime unless it has been
there's been a presentment or indictment

257
00:16:31,870 --> 00:16:35,930
by the grand jury the guarantee fitment
guarantee of

258
00:16:35,930 --> 00:16:38,930
the grand jury was her

259
00:16:38,930 --> 00:16:43,860
originally intended to his deep deep
roots going back to the Magna Carta

260
00:16:43,860 --> 00:16:48,450
it was intended to be a restriction on
the government's power

261
00:16:48,450 --> 00:16:51,890
to prosecute and imprison he has

262
00:16:51,890 --> 00:16:55,270
today a which is widely acknowledged

263
00:16:55,270 --> 00:16:59,260
become something quite different he is
the

264
00:16:59,260 --> 00:17:01,429
the them

265
00:17:01,429 --> 00:17:05,189
a an extraordinary an extensive

266
00:17:05,189 --> 00:17:08,319
an hour the government the with

267
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:12,388
very little I'm sorry to say judicial
oversight you do have the right

268
00:17:12,389 --> 00:17:16,079
to be indicted by the grand jury her but

269
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:20,049
there is really there there's not much
more to limit Taylor

270
00:17:20,049 --> 00:17:23,539
a little bit for and I suspect there
there are some you in the room

271
00:17:23,539 --> 00:17:27,929
who the who know what a grand jury is
how it works

272
00:17:27,929 --> 00:17:31,889
and what it does but I'm you kill dole's
me for a moment I'm gonna

273
00:17:31,889 --> 00:17:35,470
provide a little background for the for
the rest to the folks in the room

274
00:17:35,470 --> 00:17:39,340
a a grand jury is a body which is
something much like a

275
00:17:39,340 --> 00:17:42,230
you know what's called a petty jury
which is the one which here's trial

276
00:17:42,230 --> 00:17:43,019
cases but

277
00:17:43,019 --> 00:17:46,090
it consists of more people the

278
00:17:46,090 --> 00:17:49,759
and he did consist have some between 16
and 23 people

279
00:17:49,759 --> 00:17:53,639
their subpoena but they don't sit for a
single case they come in they said

280
00:17:53,639 --> 00:17:58,259
for eighteen months ago which can be
extended for longer

281
00:17:58,259 --> 00:18:04,399
a and he is a the it's a secret process
it it's not open to the public

282
00:18:04,399 --> 00:18:07,529
a and the only people who are

283
00:18:07,529 --> 00:18:11,249
permitted in the room a for the Grangers
themselves

284
00:18:11,249 --> 00:18:17,230
as the Niagara for the witness and the
prosecuting attorney

285
00:18:17,230 --> 00:18:20,340
I know the people are available now

286
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:23,720
to be sure this is a constitutional
right but

287
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:28,149
the rights that that we have a

288
00:18:28,149 --> 00:18:32,100
mobile mccovey me the

289
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:34,830
though never say one other thing about
the grand jury Gresham is sit in a

290
00:18:34,830 --> 00:18:35,840
particular place

291
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:39,330
so for example what we work we have come
to call the

292
00:18:39,330 --> 00:18:42,490
the WikiLeaks grand jury is sitting in
the Northern District two

293
00:18:42,490 --> 00:18:47,509
Virginia the not by accident was brought
there that's the court which is

294
00:18:47,509 --> 00:18:51,340
the which is still with the number I've
national security cases

295
00:18:51,340 --> 00:18:55,809
yet he is geographically it's that the
location at the pentagon

296
00:18:55,809 --> 00:18:59,428
a and is within the jurisdiction of the
United States Court of Appeals for the

297
00:18:59,429 --> 00:19:03,450
for the 4th circuit which is which is
the

298
00:19:03,450 --> 00:19:07,769
frequently described as a is a very
conservative judicial circuit so that it

299
00:19:07,769 --> 00:19:11,820
it's a setup which is which is in many
respects favorable to the government

300
00:19:11,820 --> 00:19:15,070
but no you do it's not that we're

301
00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:18,220
we are without rights you have the right

302
00:19:18,220 --> 00:19:22,210
to appear before the grand jury with a
lawyer I

303
00:19:22,210 --> 00:19:25,679
indeed you can't bring the lawyer into
the grand jury a

304
00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:29,730
if you work or some into appears
subpoenaed to appear before a grand jury

305
00:19:29,730 --> 00:19:34,080
you go by yourself you may consult with
counsel beforehand

306
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:38,100
you are permitted to walk out of the
room

307
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:43,019
and topped the council but you're not
there and you don't have someone to

308
00:19:43,019 --> 00:19:45,139
speak for you your role in the grand
jury

309
00:19:45,139 --> 00:19:49,279
is to answer questions days been
described as with the grand jury

310
00:19:49,279 --> 00:19:52,730
has the right to every person's evidence
a

311
00:19:52,730 --> 00:19:55,669
but there's nothing on the other side to
win a second I don't want to give you

312
00:19:55,669 --> 00:19:56,429
that evidence

313
00:19:56,429 --> 00:20:00,090
a you have the right to have your

314
00:20:00,090 --> 00:20:04,330
records including electronic records
subpoenaed and

315
00:20:04,330 --> 00:20:08,070
and subpoenaed brought before the grand
jury the

316
00:20:08,070 --> 00:20:11,720
head you have the right the

317
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:14,919
as is the public not to know what's
happening in the grand jury

318
00:20:14,919 --> 00:20:20,090
the press is not admitted and their
limits on did what can be disclosed that

319
00:20:20,090 --> 00:20:21,129
those in the room

320
00:20:21,129 --> 00:20:24,549
are not free to talk about what happens
a.m.

321
00:20:24,549 --> 00:20:27,710
her you have the right

322
00:20:27,710 --> 00:20:31,149
not to have that disclosed to anyone
else course unless

323
00:20:31,149 --> 00:20:35,690
the government which is to disclose it
to another government agency to a law

324
00:20:35,690 --> 00:20:36,809
enforcement agency

325
00:20:36,809 --> 00:20:39,950
and if it involves foreign intelligence

326
00:20:39,950 --> 00:20:43,539
to disclose it to a substantial

327
00:20:43,539 --> 00:20:49,000
ray have have other government agencies
in including immigration so long as its

328
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:52,080
the in some way related to

329
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:59,080
the what their law enforcement issues
you have

330
00:21:00,140 --> 00:21:03,080
head you have the right to be questioned

331
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:08,030
her on a much broader scale then you
would be in a piano

332
00:21:08,030 --> 00:21:11,190
you know trial Ste the new

333
00:21:11,190 --> 00:21:16,060
grand jury the can base its
investigation its issuance

334
00:21:16,060 --> 00:21:20,210
subpoenas is calling people before it on
the basis is

335
00:21:20,210 --> 00:21:25,020
the mere suspicion that interested in
looking at something indeed it is

336
00:21:25,020 --> 00:21:28,540
that interested in proving that the law
has not been violated

337
00:21:28,540 --> 00:21:32,040
the that is that its discretion is quite
broad in the questions

338
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:35,680
are not limited in any way by the

339
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:40,060
the rules of evidence prosecutor can ask
me whatever good indeed

340
00:21:40,060 --> 00:21:43,419
there is no exclusionary rule in the

341
00:21:43,420 --> 00:21:47,720
in the grand jury so that if the
government learns information which is

342
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:48,440
obtained

343
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:52,050
as a result unlawful search a

344
00:21:52,050 --> 00:21:56,909
it can nevertheless asked questions
based on that and

345
00:21:56,910 --> 00:22:01,310
all that it know that it needed then
that doesn't come up later the only

346
00:22:01,310 --> 00:22:02,440
exception to that is

347
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:06,290
a narrow statutory exclusion for certain
the

348
00:22:06,290 --> 00:22:09,879
electronic surveillance which the
government has done illegally

349
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:13,190
even then very difficult to prove it so
that's

350
00:22:13,190 --> 00:22:16,740
that's basically the

351
00:22:16,740 --> 00:22:19,880
the context a now

352
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:23,580
that brings us to woulda

353
00:22:23,580 --> 00:22:27,080
will call the WikiLeaks grand jury the
government will not concede that they're

354
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:27,639
even

355
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:31,880
is a grand jury a but we have

356
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:38,880
in number people have been

357
00:22:41,289 --> 00:22:43,840
the notion that I should be talking to
anybody in this room

358
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:47,289
with the computer in from is

359
00:22:47,289 --> 00:22:51,260
is just wrong well measure this from

360
00:22:51,260 --> 00:22:55,789
down there

361
00:22:55,789 --> 00:22:59,009
the weekend so this is this is the
subpoena

362
00:22:59,009 --> 00:23:02,480
bitches says you have to show up at the
grand jury

363
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:05,759
he can be issued to anyone anywhere in
the country's long

364
00:23:05,759 --> 00:23:09,720
territorial jurisdiction United States
indeed their trees which permit

365
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:12,950
the government to reach out and see the
assistance have

366
00:23:12,950 --> 00:23:16,470
a other nations with whom it has the

367
00:23:16,470 --> 00:23:19,670
bilateral agreements to assist me in

368
00:23:19,670 --> 00:23:23,350
law enforcement so a few so

369
00:23:23,350 --> 00:23:27,630
and the one thing that is now the
practice and

370
00:23:27,630 --> 00:23:31,880
and is generally required is that the is
that the government is required to tell

371
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:32,250
you

372
00:23:32,250 --> 00:23:35,350
when you get a subpoena am generally

373
00:23:35,350 --> 00:23:38,680
what they're looking into and so in this
case

374
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:42,670
the it says here your show presser

375
00:23:42,670 --> 00:23:45,880
day and this is in bright yellow

376
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:49,620
which can't see and you also can't read

377
00:23:49,620 --> 00:23:53,720
name anybody read that

378
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:57,960
okay on wanted what it says is this this
this is the

379
00:23:57,960 --> 00:24:02,230
the grand jury is investigating what

380
00:24:02,230 --> 00:24:05,800
what he is on its face he really white

381
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:09,330
broad definition what went wrong the
turn

382
00:24:09,330 --> 00:24:12,409
what what Ben said is that

383
00:24:12,410 --> 00:24:17,050
there's there's this buddy a first
amendment law that were a little

384
00:24:17,050 --> 00:24:17,680
uncertain

385
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:21,380
and so with the government has is they
have a

386
00:24:21,380 --> 00:24:25,490
government employees who who has
certainly less rights

387
00:24:25,490 --> 00:24:30,350
to leak or disclose information gay
slurs helmet so we have

388
00:24:30,350 --> 00:24:33,840
Bradley Manning and went into the
spectrum the other end of the spectrum

389
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:34,889
we have

390
00:24:34,890 --> 00:24:39,630
Juliana silage and WikiLeaks

391
00:24:39,630 --> 00:24:42,740
and the New York Times and The Guardian
a

392
00:24:42,740 --> 00:24:47,400
and to Spiegel at the other end hard
what the government would like to do

393
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:50,630
his bring them together

394
00:24:50,630 --> 00:24:55,160
they want to say my head WikiLeaks
assigns want to say

395
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:58,420
were like the times which is

396
00:24:58,420 --> 00:25:02,130
publish in with the government and

397
00:25:02,130 --> 00:25:05,560
and I'm speculating here the the
government does Nick Belgian the

398
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:06,530
government like to say

399
00:25:06,530 --> 00:25:10,700
you're not the times you're not the
Guardian you are

400
00:25:10,700 --> 00:25:14,100
Bradley Mann you are

401
00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:18,370
agreement and and at the crux if they're
is

402
00:25:18,370 --> 00:25:22,630
arm how to find out how

403
00:25:22,630 --> 00:25:25,910
information that is super with soup was
supposedly

404
00:25:25,910 --> 00:25:29,530
leak by Manning got

405
00:25:29,530 --> 00:25:33,680
to WikiLeaks and to the time said to the
other people who published

406
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:37,680
and what the the what the the

407
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:41,800
purposes the grand jury is in this case
is to show

408
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:45,820
that assigns particularly sciences

409
00:25:45,820 --> 00:25:49,879
his as we see how this is going partly
for the reasons that the

410
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:53,620
the been identified you can't we're not
gonna

411
00:25:53,620 --> 00:25:56,810
going to extradite WikiLeaks

412
00:25:56,810 --> 00:26:00,790
who can extradited such he's a person

413
00:26:00,790 --> 00:26:04,050
he can be brought from one jurisdiction
to another

414
00:26:04,050 --> 00:26:07,100
so the no shoes a

415
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:10,679
in in illegal for me is to say the

416
00:26:10,679 --> 00:26:13,860
that assigns is

417
00:26:13,860 --> 00:26:17,580
more like Manning in like the new york
times

418
00:26:17,580 --> 00:26:20,600
and that's that's not gonna be

419
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:24,050
no how that plays out by then in doing
that they

420
00:26:24,050 --> 00:26:28,440
they would need to show where to look
into home

421
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:32,840
how information came

422
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:36,510
from want the source the

423
00:26:36,510 --> 00:26:40,320
to the target to to signs and

424
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:44,020
to with the pics hmmm and

425
00:26:44,020 --> 00:26:47,030
day on our presumably

426
00:26:47,030 --> 00:26:51,970
calling people before the grand jury who
are going to tell them how that's done

427
00:26:51,970 --> 00:26:55,500
now there's another aspect to the grand
jury which I wanna talk about briefly

428
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:59,980
and that is that even after the gym can
choose is completed his deliberations

429
00:26:59,980 --> 00:27:03,560
and has returned an indictment

430
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:09,200
the government may nevertheless s that
the indictment be sealed in not released

431
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:11,429
to the public now that the rule

432
00:27:11,429 --> 00:27:14,730
that permits the government to the it
focuses on

433
00:27:14,730 --> 00:27:18,350
people who are not in custody %uh

434
00:27:18,350 --> 00:27:22,130
who are will remain at large and would
presumably flee from

435
00:27:22,130 --> 00:27:26,050
not not an unreasonable position %uh

436
00:27:26,050 --> 00:27:29,889
the question that has to be honest here

437
00:27:29,890 --> 00:27:33,920
here's and it was reported earlier this
year

438
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:38,179
the according to the musical strat for
hack

439
00:27:38,179 --> 00:27:41,670
which is published by WikiLeaks that
that

440
00:27:41,670 --> 00:27:46,350
at the end of February dad assigned had
in fact been indicted

441
00:27:46,350 --> 00:27:50,820
there was an indictment various people
in the security firm Stratfor whose

442
00:27:50,820 --> 00:27:51,669
records were

443
00:27:51,670 --> 00:27:55,179
were hacked by news purportedly by
anonymous

444
00:27:55,179 --> 00:27:59,780
a ahead said we got him he's going to be
indicted everything is done

445
00:27:59,780 --> 00:28:02,860
now that yeah if there is any guide

446
00:28:02,860 --> 00:28:07,600
the government still has the authority
to have scored to seal their to withhold

447
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:08,550
from the public

448
00:28:08,550 --> 00:28:12,750
whole different so much and and I think
one of the interesting things about this

449
00:28:12,750 --> 00:28:15,850
is that that would be a new

450
00:28:15,850 --> 00:28:19,130
arguably a significant issue in the in
the legal proceedings

451
00:28:19,130 --> 00:28:23,330
United Kingdom I'll we're sign is
contending

452
00:28:23,330 --> 00:28:26,620
that he the there's a month already

453
00:28:26,620 --> 00:28:30,650
to extradite him to Sweden but it be

454
00:28:30,650 --> 00:28:34,440
the dad the process is being manipulated

455
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:37,710
other in order to secure

456
00:28:37,710 --> 00:28:41,510
his his ultimate extradition to the
United States to face criminal charges

457
00:28:41,510 --> 00:28:44,650
the answer's no cuz we go we don't know
that

458
00:28:44,650 --> 00:28:48,510
we don't know that it's that's that's
working on

459
00:28:48,510 --> 00:28:52,480
but the what to go back

460
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:57,010
to what what the core of the
investigation years the government says

461
00:28:57,010 --> 00:28:58,530
it's investigating

462
00:28:58,530 --> 00:29:01,899
a few things here its first it says is
investigating

463
00:29:01,900 --> 00:29:04,910
violations at the Espionage Act

464
00:29:04,910 --> 00:29:08,530
which which which been described a

465
00:29:08,530 --> 00:29:12,149
which essentially prohibits the
disclosure

466
00:29:12,150 --> 00:29:16,860
information to someone who is not
entitled to receive it

467
00:29:16,860 --> 00:29:20,580
a hand and how that's done

468
00:29:20,580 --> 00:29:23,810
a bit but the second in more the

469
00:29:23,810 --> 00:29:27,780
troubling for that is that the it says
were also investigating

470
00:29:27,780 --> 00:29:31,280
hey conspiracy her

471
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:35,370
which he is a much broader theory of
criminal criminal liability which simply

472
00:29:35,370 --> 00:29:37,280
suggest that there is some

473
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:41,200
agreement and that they need only be a
single overt act

474
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:44,610
to do that so that if the process by
which

475
00:29:44,610 --> 00:29:48,760
documents allegedly flowed

476
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:51,760
from Manning to ultimate publication

477
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:55,420
I'm WikiLeaks times spiegel are

478
00:29:55,420 --> 00:29:58,700
if someone knew about that agreed to do
it

479
00:29:58,700 --> 00:30:03,060
that's a much broader theory and it
incorporates not only the Espionage Act

480
00:30:03,060 --> 00:30:05,260
up but the

481
00:30:05,260 --> 00:30:08,430
the theft of government property by
statute

482
00:30:08,430 --> 00:30:12,360
and the statute which more broadly
prohibits

483
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:15,560
computer hack under which

484
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:20,740
dangers members of Anonymous ahead and
other folks have been

485
00:30:20,740 --> 00:30:26,090
currently being prosecuted in New York
and Los Angeles might might I missed his

486
00:30:26,090 --> 00:30:29,100
has run I'm running into catherine's
time so

487
00:30:29,100 --> 00:30:32,280
let me stop their internet every
catherine's week and she can describe

488
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:35,879
different intrusion on individual rights

489
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:40,580
you thanks so

490
00:30:40,580 --> 00:30:44,870
I'm going to switch gears a little bit
and I'm going to talk about some

491
00:30:44,870 --> 00:30:49,340
love the broader ramifications if the
government wiki leaks investigation

492
00:30:49,340 --> 00:30:53,490
and you know the wiki leaks
investigation has in some sense been

493
00:30:53,490 --> 00:30:57,590
you know one domino that his then set of
these incredible

494
00:30:57,590 --> 00:31:01,350
chain fax burstyn the media but also

495
00:31:01,350 --> 00:31:05,060
in our legal system and it's come at a
very interesting

496
00:31:05,060 --> 00:31:08,250
time because it is come at a time where

497
00:31:08,250 --> 00:31:11,270
on no one really knows how to interpret

498
00:31:11,270 --> 00:31:16,030
the fourth amendment anymore it used to
be the case in the pre digital world

499
00:31:16,030 --> 00:31:19,610
that most of the important questions
about what was a search and seizure and

500
00:31:19,610 --> 00:31:21,570
what were the limits on the government's
power

501
00:31:21,570 --> 00:31:25,100
were largely worked out and then when

502
00:31:25,100 --> 00:31:28,470
digital technology became so much more
widespread

503
00:31:28,470 --> 00:31:31,670
many of these fundamental assumptions

504
00:31:31,670 --> 00:31:34,690
began to be challenged and um

505
00:31:34,690 --> 00:31:38,470
that of course coincided with the fact
that we now store more and more digital

506
00:31:38,470 --> 00:31:43,730
data than we ever have previously
creating this incredibly tempting trove

507
00:31:43,730 --> 00:31:46,860
and data for government investigators
add to

508
00:31:46,860 --> 00:31:52,390
look into you am and so this combination
of factors had actually

509
00:31:52,390 --> 00:31:55,510
and led to another way in which
WikiLeaks has

510
00:31:55,510 --> 00:32:00,290
shed light on what is going on and that
is several cases that have resulted in

511
00:32:00,290 --> 00:32:01,460
some sense from

512
00:32:01,460 --> 00:32:04,600
the WikiLeaks investigation have shed
light on ways

513
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:07,810
in which an the executive has

514
00:32:07,810 --> 00:32:11,290
increasingly been accessing our personal
data to investigate yes

515
00:32:11,290 --> 00:32:16,860
and I'm gonna focus briefly on two cases
the ACLU has been involved in that have

516
00:32:16,860 --> 00:32:18,760
recently these related issues

517
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:22,100
am wanted them deals with the
government's

518
00:32:22,100 --> 00:32:26,250
search policy at the international
border and as some love you

519
00:32:26,250 --> 00:32:29,860
may know and I know somebody do because
I love you actually had your laptop

520
00:32:29,860 --> 00:32:31,350
searched at the international border

521
00:32:31,350 --> 00:32:34,740
the government argues that it can search
your laptop yourself owner any

522
00:32:34,740 --> 00:32:37,650
electronic device you bring with you
across the border

523
00:32:37,650 --> 00:32:42,490
for any reason or no reason at all it is
a purely suspicion the search

524
00:32:42,490 --> 00:32:47,110
policy it actually is even broader than
that they argue that if

525
00:32:47,110 --> 00:32:50,880
you're crossing the border and they want
to for example continue to search your

526
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:53,430
device reply on puter time they can take
it from you

527
00:32:53,430 --> 00:32:57,000
and they can continue to search it for
as long as they

528
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:01,670
once there is one restriction the person
doing the searching every 15 or 30 days

529
00:33:01,670 --> 00:33:05,150
has to go get a supervisor checkoff to
keep your laptop for a little longer

530
00:33:05,150 --> 00:33:08,090
but they argue that there's no
constitutional restriction on any of

531
00:33:08,090 --> 00:33:08,550
this

532
00:33:08,550 --> 00:33:12,399
moreover they have the broad authority
to keep

533
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:16,110
the data they take from your electronic
device for any

534
00:33:16,110 --> 00:33:19,260
law enforcement purpose and a term that

535
00:33:19,260 --> 00:33:22,890
we're not really sure what it means but
is awfully broad and of course once

536
00:33:22,890 --> 00:33:24,470
someone has a copy if your data

537
00:33:24,470 --> 00:33:27,660
that where that data goes is

538
00:33:27,660 --> 00:33:30,750
is often a can be difficult to trace on

539
00:33:30,750 --> 00:33:34,470
still with that background in mind and

540
00:33:34,470 --> 00:33:37,910
one in the cases we've been involved in
is representing an individual named

541
00:33:37,910 --> 00:33:39,000
David house

542
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:42,610
and John I actually both represent and
mister house

543
00:33:42,610 --> 00:33:47,100
and David is one of the cofounders urban
organization had the Bradley Manning

544
00:33:47,100 --> 00:33:48,110
support network

545
00:33:48,110 --> 00:33:51,270
which is an organization dedicated to
providing

546
00:33:51,270 --> 00:33:55,820
and did to trying to support Bradley
Manning and to provide funds for his

547
00:33:55,820 --> 00:33:57,149
legal defense

548
00:33:57,150 --> 00:34:00,280
I think there is a perception that and

549
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:04,020
that a lot of attention is being paid to
SI engine wiki leaks but there wasn't

550
00:34:04,020 --> 00:34:05,620
enough being done to support

551
00:34:05,620 --> 00:34:09,919
the person who and who alleged police is
accused

552
00:34:09,918 --> 00:34:14,029
have releasing on this information the
first place and David was involved in

553
00:34:14,030 --> 00:34:15,490
helping to found out

554
00:34:15,490 --> 00:34:19,419
organization and then a few months later
when he was returning

555
00:34:19,418 --> 00:34:23,549
from personal vacation in Mexico he
crossed the international border

556
00:34:23,550 --> 00:34:26,669
and the government stopped him and

557
00:34:26,668 --> 00:34:29,739
and took his laptop and other electronic
devices

558
00:34:29,740 --> 00:34:33,679
and held on to them they ultimately let
him into the country after questioning

559
00:34:33,679 --> 00:34:34,340
him

560
00:34:34,340 --> 00:34:37,700
about his role in the Bradley Manning
support network and

561
00:34:37,700 --> 00:34:42,110
and and things like that but they kept
his electronic devices and actually they

562
00:34:42,110 --> 00:34:46,530
didn't end up returning his laptop for
about forty nine days

563
00:34:46,530 --> 00:34:49,940
david was obviously understandably upset
about all of this

564
00:34:49,940 --> 00:34:53,899
and among other things he had many sent
to the materials belonging to the

565
00:34:53,899 --> 00:34:55,989
support network on his laptop

566
00:34:55,990 --> 00:34:59,750
and and for instance he had and the less

567
00:34:59,750 --> 00:35:03,540
the membership lists love people in the
Bradley Manning support network

568
00:35:03,540 --> 00:35:08,410
on his device and and the idea that the
government could simply take this

569
00:35:08,410 --> 00:35:13,049
do that and search policy and that they
had that authorize them to search your

570
00:35:13,050 --> 00:35:15,790
device that any reason to believe that
you've been gauging wrongdoing

571
00:35:15,790 --> 00:35:16,810
whatsoever

572
00:35:16,810 --> 00:35:20,620
I was obviously extremely concerning to
him and I think a real a real threat to

573
00:35:20,620 --> 00:35:24,870
many of our privacy rights in our right
to free speech am

574
00:35:24,870 --> 00:35:28,440
the ACLU ultimately decided only

575
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:32,360
decided to represent David and we filed
a lawsuit in federal court in

576
00:35:32,360 --> 00:35:33,550
Massachusetts

577
00:35:33,550 --> 00:35:38,500
arguing that what had happened to David
violated both the first and the fourth

578
00:35:38,500 --> 00:35:39,810
amendment

579
00:35:39,810 --> 00:35:43,710
rights and I'll just briefly set out
what r claims are in that case

580
00:35:43,710 --> 00:35:46,960
and I'll just give you a little bit of
an update on on where the case

581
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:51,280
is and there's a fourth amendment claim
in the case

582
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:54,580
the for the moment as I mentioned
protects against unreasonable searches

583
00:35:54,580 --> 00:35:55,440
and seizures

584
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:58,950
and we are you that and given

585
00:35:58,950 --> 00:36:02,930
that is sensitive nature what is on a
laptop and that it is not

586
00:36:02,930 --> 00:36:07,069
that it violates that prohibition to
engage in a purely suspicion a search of

587
00:36:07,070 --> 00:36:08,040
someone's

588
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:11,700
laptop a we also have a second argument

589
00:36:11,700 --> 00:36:15,800
which is that and the government cannot
then take your device

590
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:18,940
and keep it for forty nine days to
continue searching it

591
00:36:18,940 --> 00:36:22,000
am without at least reasonable suspicion
that you been

592
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:25,900
that you engaged in wrongdoing there's a
Fourth Amendment claims and as for the

593
00:36:25,900 --> 00:36:26,970
first minute claim

594
00:36:26,970 --> 00:36:30,840
it really centers on David role in the
support network

595
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:34,870
am we believe he was targeted for
research because it his involvement

596
00:36:34,870 --> 00:36:38,859
that sport network and that and and that
the search

597
00:36:38,860 --> 00:36:42,140
cause harm to the support network and
because

598
00:36:42,140 --> 00:36:46,529
and people for example may be reluctant
to donate to an organization

599
00:36:46,530 --> 00:36:50,490
where and units that's politically
controversial and then having the

600
00:36:50,490 --> 00:36:52,020
membership lists taken in

601
00:36:52,020 --> 00:36:55,600
an internal emails really makes people
feel insecure about being

602
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:59,640
involved in something like that and the
first amendment has for a long time

603
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:03,540
protected the right people to associate
free from government intrusion

604
00:37:03,540 --> 00:37:08,120
and this doctrine dates you know it it's
very old it it's in the civil rights

605
00:37:08,120 --> 00:37:08,790
movement

606
00:37:08,790 --> 00:37:13,150
at least and the most prominent case and
Bob attempts in states like Alabama to

607
00:37:13,150 --> 00:37:15,310
force the NAACP to disclose

608
00:37:15,310 --> 00:37:18,830
its members rate and the court in those
cases said

609
00:37:18,830 --> 00:37:23,560
you know you have a right to engage in
political organizing and association

610
00:37:23,560 --> 00:37:26,700
and obviously infringes on that right to
have

611
00:37:26,700 --> 00:37:30,010
your to be forced to disclose your your
membership list

612
00:37:30,010 --> 00:37:33,580
am to those in the nature over the
claims we actually got a pretty good

613
00:37:33,580 --> 00:37:36,480
decision from the judge in that case

614
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:40,990
use a few months ago it was a it was it
was a mixed decision

615
00:37:40,990 --> 00:37:45,160
and the the First Amendment claim the
judge

616
00:37:45,160 --> 00:37:49,149
said it did judge upheld and it it said
that

617
00:37:49,150 --> 00:37:53,040
if the government targets your
electronic devices for research

618
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:57,380
because your association activity then
you have made out a first amendment

619
00:37:57,380 --> 00:38:00,800
claim and she's allowing us to go
forward and tissue

620
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:04,150
put into evidence the fax we need in
order to prove that claim

621
00:38:04,150 --> 00:38:08,710
the Fourth Amendment claim a me
unfortunately the ruling was more mixed

622
00:38:08,710 --> 00:38:12,680
she endorsed the idea that you can have
your electronic devices searched at the

623
00:38:12,680 --> 00:38:13,440
border

624
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:16,540
for any reason she endorsed the purely
suspicion a search

625
00:38:16,540 --> 00:38:20,820
policy am she was however willing to put
some limits on the link

626
00:38:20,820 --> 00:38:25,400
%uh time that the government can keep
your electronic devices

627
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:28,800
the government argued that they should
be able to keep them indefinitely

628
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:32,670
and she wasn't having any of that she
said that the the link the time they

629
00:38:32,670 --> 00:38:35,580
keep you alert on device in at least
needs to be commensurate

630
00:38:35,580 --> 00:38:39,450
with its need to rate you can't keep it
for a very long time

631
00:38:39,450 --> 00:38:43,210
and the government essentially said
we're overworked and and there is

632
00:38:43,210 --> 00:38:46,490
you know an operating system we weren't
very familiar with on this laptop and so

633
00:38:46,490 --> 00:38:47,290
therefore

634
00:38:47,290 --> 00:38:50,950
we needed forty nine days in order to
make a copy of it and we had an extra

635
00:38:50,950 --> 00:38:53,950
declaration did suggest that was
ridiculous that it's not that hard to

636
00:38:53,950 --> 00:38:55,570
make happy and out on a laptop

637
00:38:55,570 --> 00:38:58,690
and I can see that a lot of people here
agreement that

638
00:38:58,690 --> 00:39:03,200
and and so we've been allowed to go for
it on that claim

639
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:06,300
in particular but in some ways you know
this policy has

640
00:39:06,300 --> 00:39:10,240
has been in play at least since the is
this message party has been around since

641
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:14,310
at least the mid 2000's but I feel like
a lot more people have

642
00:39:14,310 --> 00:39:18,370
have heard about it and can be concerned
about it because

643
00:39:18,370 --> 00:39:23,130
a the way that though them be at the
wiki leaks

644
00:39:23,130 --> 00:39:26,640
ASM aftershocks have said shed some
light on this also

645
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:30,650
am yet the other case with it others
mention

646
00:39:30,650 --> 00:39:34,080
very briefly I think because we wanna
leave temping first first

647
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:38,100
whenever you wanna talk about I'll we
represent some individuals who have

648
00:39:38,100 --> 00:39:39,109
gotten said

649
00:39:39,109 --> 00:39:42,810
who the government has sent subpoenas to
Twitter to get access to their account

650
00:39:42,810 --> 00:39:43,640
information

651
00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:48,020
right an I don't think the public fully
understood the degree to which this is a

652
00:39:48,020 --> 00:39:50,020
prime investigative technique

653
00:39:50,020 --> 00:39:53,109
until of a sudden in a major media

654
00:39:53,109 --> 00:39:56,549
publications are running stories about
did access

655
00:39:56,550 --> 00:40:00,200
other government beyond attempt to force
to turn over and

656
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:04,560
account information a people who are
upset broadly

657
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:08,109
and caught up in this year wiki leaks
and

658
00:40:08,109 --> 00:40:11,250
so in some sense is that they're looking
at investigation is also serves shed

659
00:40:11,250 --> 00:40:12,180
light under

660
00:40:12,180 --> 00:40:15,940
degree to which our account information
can be used in investigations against us

661
00:40:15,940 --> 00:40:19,990
often under an lacks or poorly
understood legal standards

662
00:40:19,990 --> 00:40:23,510
and say guess us up there in the ass in
us

663
00:40:23,510 --> 00:40:26,930
so that you are can and if people wanna
talk about any

664
00:40:26,930 --> 00:40:32,669
any she's in particular is make a
hundred that

665
00:40:32,670 --> 00:40:36,440
great and yet you can I have a defined
and and we were just ask because we

666
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:38,190
don't have a whole lot of time if people
could

667
00:40:38,190 --> 00:40:41,520
tried a keep their questions or comments
about a minute I would be helpful

668
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:45,530
thanks I would just like to know arm
about the mechanics

669
00:40:45,530 --> 00:40:48,800
I'll runway grand juries a little bit
other al

670
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:52,460
question its I'm

671
00:40:52,460 --> 00:40:56,070
the you runaway grand juries

672
00:40:56,070 --> 00:40:57,970
is

673
00:40:57,970 --> 00:41:00,740
is a great mythological creature a

674
00:41:00,740 --> 00:41:04,230
the grand jurors actually in theory
control the room

675
00:41:04,230 --> 00:41:08,780
the and do vote on it and it's the vote
to the grand jury that makes a

676
00:41:08,780 --> 00:41:09,300
difference

677
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:12,900
prosecutors in the present says that
gathering evidence

678
00:41:12,900 --> 00:41:16,090
but the apocryphal stance is that the

679
00:41:16,090 --> 00:41:20,660
there the government can easily secure
the indictment a ham sandwich

680
00:41:20,660 --> 00:41:23,759
and that I think who accurately reflects
the dynamics

681
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:27,470
the crank Richard practice thank you
notes like to ask questions

682
00:41:27,470 --> 00:41:30,730
between a case like to know if leader

683
00:41:30,730 --> 00:41:35,340
on Steelers standing as on attorney in
sure affected it any differently

684
00:41:35,340 --> 00:41:39,890
he did that's interesting question

685
00:41:39,890 --> 00:41:42,970
a think he ensuing should be no

686
00:41:42,970 --> 00:41:46,330
because I don't think the government
should be getting this information about

687
00:41:46,330 --> 00:41:50,970
anyone and but hear things obviously get
particularly sensitive when you're

688
00:41:50,970 --> 00:41:53,320
talking about people a political
affiliations with

689
00:41:53,320 --> 00:41:57,230
with their in with with with foreign
powers in areas various

690
00:41:57,230 --> 00:42:00,270
diplomatic concerns right there wouldn't
be a difference under the fourth

691
00:42:00,270 --> 00:42:01,030
amendment

692
00:42:01,030 --> 00:42:05,310
you would think that the administration
would show a little bit more restraint

693
00:42:05,310 --> 00:42:08,020
when it's dealing with an elected member
a foreign government but

694
00:42:08,020 --> 00:42:11,050
and dozens injured he would happen you
think

695
00:42:11,050 --> 00:42:16,480
thank you hi

696
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:20,240
um so I'm in the journalists I'm onto

697
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:23,830
Alexandria have also gone for me arm

698
00:42:23,830 --> 00:42:28,580
and the thing that really shocks me is
that David Coons Bradley Manning's

699
00:42:28,580 --> 00:42:29,200
lawyer

700
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:34,490
arm had a discovery motion for this wiki
leaks grand jury testimony

701
00:42:34,490 --> 00:42:38,040
and he receives full custom

702
00:42:38,040 --> 00:42:41,520
said every single page in every single
word was redacted

703
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:45,730
I not a single word we did get the
records

704
00:42:45,730 --> 00:42:49,470
you got home work

705
00:42:49,470 --> 00:42:52,170
home and David Coombs show the same

706
00:42:52,170 --> 00:42:55,359
in core arm meanwhile I

707
00:42:55,359 --> 00:42:59,759
I was pressing I'll wuv public affairs

708
00:42:59,759 --> 00:43:02,769
home legal briefers

709
00:43:02,769 --> 00:43:06,589
about whether this grand jury was still
going on

710
00:43:06,589 --> 00:43:10,910
and he acted like he had never even
heard home

711
00:43:10,910 --> 00:43:15,480
eighties that will last apartment just
as I no correlation with them

712
00:43:15,480 --> 00:43:19,690
arm but the government seems to be
acting like this isn't going on at all

713
00:43:19,690 --> 00:43:23,609
and at what point will they have to
finally admit

714
00:43:23,609 --> 00:43:27,680
that this has been going on this been
going on for two years now arm

715
00:43:27,680 --> 00:43:31,328
we don't know dates a venue this

716
00:43:31,329 --> 00:43:36,210
run roughly new we believe that the deal
was impaneled in December 2010

717
00:43:36,210 --> 00:43:42,230
but but the end and so it would be at
the end if its normal course right now

718
00:43:42,230 --> 00:43:46,609
up but could be extended by by the court
for at least another six months

719
00:43:46,609 --> 00:43:50,319
and it's a special grand jury there are
different rules apply a

720
00:43:50,319 --> 00:43:54,808
the like you there also could be sealed
indictments which which which

721
00:43:54,809 --> 00:43:58,119
the court could permitted them to sit on
for whatever reason

722
00:43:58,119 --> 00:44:02,259
and we have no idea thats include
weekend

723
00:44:02,259 --> 00:44:06,769
from what I know no it'd

724
00:44:06,769 --> 00:44:10,509
do we know if people being called before
it now through connections

725
00:44:10,509 --> 00:44:13,539
anecdotally when was the last time we
heard somebody know I

726
00:44:13,539 --> 00:44:17,049
him my informal survey

727
00:44:17,049 --> 00:44:20,759
I didn't learn anything but I I didn't
you know I

728
00:44:20,759 --> 00:44:24,759
can see there are lots of people who
could be called remember that there

729
00:44:24,759 --> 00:44:28,930
there would be looking at the process as
well as individuals is not simply the

730
00:44:28,930 --> 00:44:29,828
move with the how

731
00:44:29,829 --> 00:44:33,819
the that they're they're investigating
in him that can

732
00:44:33,819 --> 00:44:37,079
extend much more broadly the than the
circle

733
00:44:37,079 --> 00:44:40,569
lawyers who might might have been
engaged in

734
00:44:40,569 --> 00:44:44,009
in representing people who could be
called the furniture thank you

735
00:44:44,009 --> 00:44:48,829
I'm than the that serve well who will be
the next person come up

736
00:44:48,829 --> 00:44:52,250
assay first David house was called
before the grand jury

737
00:44:52,250 --> 00:44:56,230
a and since her he's

738
00:44:56,230 --> 00:45:00,119
are already stated his status
on-the-record

739
00:45:00,119 --> 00:45:03,619
on disclosing anything David

740
00:45:03,619 --> 00:45:07,910
appear before the grand jury he invoked
his right in the fifth amendment not to

741
00:45:07,910 --> 00:45:08,649
testify

742
00:45:08,650 --> 00:45:13,519
at school questions her under the
circumstances the government has the

743
00:45:13,519 --> 00:45:14,099
option

744
00:45:14,099 --> 00:45:18,799
the granting are seeking an order
granting immunity

745
00:45:18,799 --> 00:45:22,779
in which case her you are required to

746
00:45:22,779 --> 00:45:26,309
answer the government's questions you
can refuse

747
00:45:26,309 --> 00:45:31,230
and Rhys contempt her a man that's but
that's the only way that you can

748
00:45:31,230 --> 00:45:34,710
you can get beyond that in secret view
and even then

749
00:45:34,710 --> 00:45:38,779
the grounds on which you you can refused
to answer

750
00:45:38,779 --> 00:45:42,619
once you have been granted immunity harm

751
00:45:42,619 --> 00:45:48,150
very few and largely unavailable 'em

752
00:45:48,150 --> 00:45:51,869
you talk about searching: electronics
the border without in justification

753
00:45:51,869 --> 00:45:54,910
you to see ship your laptop across the
border obviously

754
00:45:54,910 --> 00:45:58,269
logistics are different are death but
it's whatever but

755
00:45:58,269 --> 00:46:04,690
are the legality different can they
still do that not hurt the

756
00:46:04,690 --> 00:46:08,849
there's no legal defense prep package
there is a legal difference

757
00:46:08,849 --> 00:46:12,279
oddly for first-class letter class mail

758
00:46:12,279 --> 00:46:15,490
there's a statute said he sent a letter
like

759
00:46:15,490 --> 00:46:19,529
in you just in an envelope there's a
statute that says the government cannot

760
00:46:19,529 --> 00:46:23,500
read that male without reasonable
suspicion

761
00:46:23,500 --> 00:46:26,519
an so here

762
00:46:26,519 --> 00:46:30,000
you can even take advantage that you can
of course also

763
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:35,569
you know upload your data on June
internet encrypt it before you travel

764
00:46:35,569 --> 00:46:39,609
like your laptop clean take your laptop
overseas download everything so

765
00:46:39,609 --> 00:46:43,250
you might wonder about the utility and
the suspicion message policy other than

766
00:46:43,250 --> 00:46:43,680
to

767
00:46:43,680 --> 00:46:48,149
an you know alienate people who don't
know any better

768
00:46:48,150 --> 00:46:51,390
one actually catching serious criminals
but

769
00:46:51,390 --> 00:46:54,920
on at you yeah the quest the question
raises a

770
00:46:54,920 --> 00:46:57,990
a for more interesting new ones

771
00:46:57,990 --> 00:47:02,200
the because at the border you carrying a
physical item

772
00:47:02,200 --> 00:47:05,460
his date on a if you ship something in

773
00:47:05,460 --> 00:47:08,779
your shipping a physical item which
carries data

774
00:47:08,779 --> 00:47:11,880
what home what we haven't addressed

775
00:47:11,880 --> 00:47:15,450
is whether the government is ever taken
the position

776
00:47:15,450 --> 00:47:18,690
that he is free to intercept the flow

777
00:47:18,690 --> 00:47:22,559
data into United States the

778
00:47:22,559 --> 00:47:25,809
on on a custom steering it's never
certain leaders for the No

779
00:47:25,809 --> 00:47:30,210
reverser did it would raise I think new

780
00:47:30,210 --> 00:47:33,569
for more serious problem that that being
said

781
00:47:33,569 --> 00:47:36,819
what's the point

782
00:47:36,819 --> 00:47:41,569
as the pointy the there there are no
borders

783
00:47:41,569 --> 00:47:45,319
that weathers daggers there's also a
Moore's law question how many years will

784
00:47:45,319 --> 00:47:46,819
it be before a year

785
00:47:46,819 --> 00:47:51,359
laptop can fit inside a first class and
lower red

786
00:47:51,359 --> 00:47:55,720
hammerhead well

787
00:47:55,720 --> 00:47:59,210
my question is also about the Wireless
more research is it

788
00:47:59,210 --> 00:48:02,239
settle settle all arm

789
00:48:02,239 --> 00:48:05,980
and basic has been heard from the
Supreme Court

790
00:48:05,980 --> 00:48:10,470
or I mean is basically said a law I mean
if they are kind using this to

791
00:48:10,470 --> 00:48:14,259
you know maliciously no take in and
another thing

792
00:48:14,259 --> 00:48:17,489
your things different roles orders but
they're using

793
00:48:17,489 --> 00:48:20,799
rats reporters were saying you know
we're going in

794
00:48:20,799 --> 00:48:24,038
worked with people learn from the you
know to our government near

795
00:48:24,039 --> 00:48:27,680
do taking things and then that basically
what they're doing their shipping their

796
00:48:27,680 --> 00:48:31,019
their items be a you know frank with you
know they're going to be

797
00:48:31,019 --> 00:48:35,569
you know search so i was just wondering
what

798
00:48:35,569 --> 00:48:39,730
it's not settled law but the more recent
case law

799
00:48:39,730 --> 00:48:43,809
with the person except in our case isn't
so fantastic

800
00:48:43,809 --> 00:48:47,140
and I think there's actually good
Supreme Court law thats

801
00:48:47,140 --> 00:48:51,910
older which is much more skeptical love
these broad government claims to be able

802
00:48:51,910 --> 00:48:52,720
to access

803
00:48:52,720 --> 00:48:56,220
people's reading materials when they
crossed the border am

804
00:48:56,220 --> 00:49:01,339
their unfortunate reality is that a lot
of these border six cases come up in the

805
00:49:01,339 --> 00:49:03,430
context of child pornography

806
00:49:03,430 --> 00:49:07,609
prosecutions and and I don't think any
judge

807
00:49:07,609 --> 00:49:12,170
ever wants to suppress evidence that
would allow someone who'd committed such

808
00:49:12,170 --> 00:49:13,380
a vile crime

809
00:49:13,380 --> 00:49:18,279
to go free and in that context judges
have allowed

810
00:49:18,279 --> 00:49:21,299
you have basically issued opinion saying
that you're allowed to engage in the

811
00:49:21,299 --> 00:49:22,190
surges

812
00:49:22,190 --> 00:49:26,539
on a purely suspicion as basis am but I
think those cases are wrong

813
00:49:26,539 --> 00:49:30,880
um and I think also the reasonable
suspicion standard would allow the

814
00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:31,819
government's you

815
00:49:31,819 --> 00:49:35,308
pursue the gym investigations while
stopping the worst offenses right

816
00:49:35,309 --> 00:49:38,970
targeting people for legitimate reasons
or simply arbitrarily

817
00:49:38,970 --> 00:49:44,059
um and in your other point is obviously
correct there are many people who do

818
00:49:44,059 --> 00:49:47,910
seem to be being singled out for these
searches for illegitimate reasons

819
00:49:47,910 --> 00:49:53,170
am %um Laura processes in the audience
with s England Green Man

820
00:49:53,170 --> 00:49:57,259
did a tremendous article about her
experiences crossing the border

821
00:49:57,259 --> 00:50:00,730
on able to add one other example which
is that

822
00:50:00,730 --> 00:50:04,000
there are a few people who have walked
into my office as distraught

823
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:06,980
as attorneys who have had all in their
turn a client privileged information

824
00:50:06,980 --> 00:50:08,359
seized

825
00:50:08,359 --> 00:50:11,400
and even returning a across the border

826
00:50:11,400 --> 00:50:14,420
am having to explain to your clients
that very

827
00:50:14,420 --> 00:50:18,059
personal data has been taken by the
government who may in fact be

828
00:50:18,059 --> 00:50:19,519
prosecuting them

829
00:50:19,519 --> 00:50:26,519
and is is is real burden for people who
are doing that type of work

830
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:33,420
as question on with key loggers in the
FBI

831
00:50:33,420 --> 00:50:37,160
his place cell phone spyware on cell
phones

832
00:50:37,160 --> 00:50:40,339
to track movements and even turn on arm

833
00:50:40,340 --> 00:50:43,810
my Mike condoms conversations

834
00:50:43,810 --> 00:50:48,060
weird is that billion seems to me that
the border actions more

835
00:50:48,060 --> 00:50:52,820
intimidation and harassment and probably
another layer that we need to be more

836
00:50:52,820 --> 00:50:53,570
concerned about

837
00:50:53,570 --> 00:50:57,000
with key loggers on laptops

838
00:50:57,000 --> 00:51:00,970
and themselves by so

839
00:51:00,970 --> 00:51:05,390
yeah I think that's a really good
question up to my understanding and if

840
00:51:05,390 --> 00:51:08,470
any the no differently I would love to
hear it the government has

841
00:51:08,470 --> 00:51:11,850
it the examples I know the government
using keyloggers they're generally

842
00:51:11,850 --> 00:51:15,589
getting a warrant based upon probable
cause right in a generally the best you

843
00:51:15,590 --> 00:51:16,620
can do in News

844
00:51:16,620 --> 00:51:20,609
situations am when it comes others have
to data like location data and other

845
00:51:20,610 --> 00:51:23,530
data that may be collected by cell phone
carriers in third parties mean

846
00:51:23,530 --> 00:51:27,340
yeah the New York Times just this past
Sunday had a tremendous story about the

847
00:51:27,340 --> 00:51:29,040
1.3 million

848
00:51:29,040 --> 00:51:32,880
request for customer records that are
cell phone companies are getting great

849
00:51:32,880 --> 00:51:38,490
on and the legal standards that govern
those requests are tremendously unclear

850
00:51:38,490 --> 00:51:43,230
yet Obama administration has argued that
you have no Fourth Amendment right

851
00:51:43,230 --> 00:51:46,240
in your location data kept by your cell
phone company because you have

852
00:51:46,240 --> 00:51:49,130
voluntarily can be that information to
them great

853
00:51:49,130 --> 00:51:54,430
as though it is and the just something
that you've chosen to do

854
00:51:54,430 --> 00:51:57,500
knowingly rather than being an inherent
feature the technology

855
00:51:57,500 --> 00:52:01,640
on yeah I the Supreme Court I think in a
recent decision United States versus

856
00:52:01,640 --> 00:52:04,190
Jones has raised some hope that that
type

857
00:52:04,190 --> 00:52:07,930
data I will be subjected to Warren
powerhouse requirement that these are

858
00:52:07,930 --> 00:52:09,370
uncertain times for

859
00:52:09,370 --> 00:52:12,890
for for and these types of questions

860
00:52:12,890 --> 00:52:17,339
and the court of a move very slowly to
resolve them said maybe in a decade

861
00:52:17,340 --> 00:52:19,640
before we have answers to just basic
questions

862
00:52:19,640 --> 00:52:23,839
and the the parallel to that is is that
the information which is held

863
00:52:23,840 --> 00:52:26,960
up by the phone companies

864
00:52:26,960 --> 00:52:31,010
main leaving aside the content which may
have said on the phone

865
00:52:31,010 --> 00:52:34,110
for which you you may have communicated
by email

866
00:52:34,110 --> 00:52:37,440
although the transactional data the is
his

867
00:52:37,440 --> 00:52:41,770
arguably covered by earlier Supreme
Court record lows as you have no

868
00:52:41,770 --> 00:52:43,520
expectation privacy

869
00:52:43,520 --> 00:52:46,710
10 if the government can get it from the
phone company

870
00:52:46,710 --> 00:52:49,770
from the Internet Service Provider then
your

871
00:52:49,770 --> 00:52:53,130
hadlock you don't have any way to
protect protect that and if you look at

872
00:52:53,130 --> 00:52:55,320
the terms to service the privacy
policies

873
00:52:55,320 --> 00:52:59,340
most phone companies but internet
service providers they have adequately

874
00:52:59,340 --> 00:53:01,100
protected themselves from that same

875
00:53:01,100 --> 00:53:07,950
we will respond legal process the
discussion has reminded me of something

876
00:53:07,950 --> 00:53:11,900
I think my father told me when I was in
the hydrograph and he told me

877
00:53:11,900 --> 00:53:15,070
you can sue the gun if they don't want
to pay your bill

878
00:53:15,070 --> 00:53:18,070
they won't pay it if they don't want to
answer your nose they won't

879
00:53:18,070 --> 00:53:21,740
on select I'll and instruments me the

880
00:53:21,740 --> 00:53:25,190
a lot to this discussion is very much
around the detail the you inside the

881
00:53:25,190 --> 00:53:25,690
board

882
00:53:25,690 --> 00:53:29,870
outside the border use citizen the your
amendment rights apply apply

883
00:53:29,870 --> 00:53:35,299
home do we games around the hole in the
wall with really trying to do is to sue

884
00:53:35,300 --> 00:53:36,190
the government

885
00:53:36,190 --> 00:53:39,440
well I think thats

886
00:53:39,440 --> 00:53:42,970
and there's a lot of truth in what you
said but

887
00:53:42,970 --> 00:53:47,210
it there's a limit to it as well and you
know certainly when

888
00:53:47,210 --> 00:53:50,290
the government's uses the talismanic
term

889
00:53:50,290 --> 00:53:55,009
national security most even judges who
had life tenure go scurrying to the

890
00:53:55,010 --> 00:53:55,640
hills

891
00:53:55,640 --> 00:54:00,240
and we'll do whatever they're instructed
to do by government agents but that's

892
00:54:00,240 --> 00:54:01,320
not always the case

893
00:54:01,320 --> 00:54:04,510
and not all these issues arise when we
sue the government

894
00:54:04,510 --> 00:54:07,900
I some of these issues arise when the
government sousa's

895
00:54:07,900 --> 00:54:12,030
or in other words prosecute people you
know the jones case

896
00:54:12,030 --> 00:54:15,760
where the Supreme Court unanimously
rejected the government's argument that

897
00:54:15,760 --> 00:54:16,740
they ought to be able to

898
00:54:16,740 --> 00:54:20,740
crawl under your car put a GPS on Amtrak
you for as long as they want

899
00:54:20,740 --> 00:54:24,310
you know that the justices to the
Supreme Court emphatically rejected that

900
00:54:24,310 --> 00:54:24,910
so

901
00:54:24,910 --> 00:54:28,230
you there are there is resistance and

902
00:54:28,230 --> 00:54:31,760
you know I think that when the
government is able to

903
00:54:31,760 --> 00:54:35,270
iframe these issues as national security
issues

904
00:54:35,270 --> 00:54:39,640
we tend to get routed and when we were
able to frame these issues as something

905
00:54:39,640 --> 00:54:41,029
that could affect all of us

906
00:54:41,030 --> 00:54:44,450
we tend to have more Lakhani maybe the
critical moment in the jones case was

907
00:54:44,450 --> 00:54:45,990
when Chief Justice Roberts

908
00:54:45,990 --> 00:54:50,230
said incredulously to the government
lawyer could you do that to us

909
00:54:50,230 --> 00:54:53,590
and so it's that sense that we need to

910
00:54:53,590 --> 00:54:58,020
hi you know we we we need to explain to
people how this matters and this isn't

911
00:54:58,020 --> 00:54:58,870
just about

912
00:54:58,870 --> 00:55:03,770
and you know getting more rights to
terrorists and if you do explain that to

913
00:55:03,770 --> 00:55:06,060
the people what sanctions to the people
then

914
00:55:06,060 --> 00:55:09,500
how can the people given once they
understand it

915
00:55:09,500 --> 00:55:13,130
we have a very small subset to the
people who do understand it

916
00:55:13,130 --> 00:55:17,640
and it seems to me that it's in nobody's
interest to explain to the people at

917
00:55:17,640 --> 00:55:19,180
large in this country

918
00:55:19,180 --> 00:55:23,040
yene in this is in their interest well

919
00:55:23,040 --> 00:55:26,770
you know on that no one up here is a
better expert anyone out there

920
00:55:26,770 --> 00:55:32,420
on on how to add to educate organize an
advocate for these issues

921
00:55:32,420 --> 00:55:35,660
and I don't think anybody is an
experience and if we knew the answers

922
00:55:35,660 --> 00:55:40,190
we probably be doing something else but
thank you all for being here on a on a

923
00:55:40,190 --> 00:55:41,690
Friday night it was really an honor for
acts
