1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:05,210
which is I'm really something incredible
I think the Yes Men have been too hope

2
00:00:05,210 --> 00:00:05,920
before

3
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:09,179
they they were not headlining hope
they're kinda low-key about it but they

4
00:00:09,179 --> 00:00:10,280
have been here

5
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:14,170
and it's really awesome that they're in
New York so much

6
00:00:14,170 --> 00:00:18,810
arm basically we have a lot of people

7
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:22,229
come to these conferences and speak
onstage at have a lot of balls

8
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:26,630
but I don't think anybody can beat these
guys who basically impersonate

9
00:00:26,630 --> 00:00:30,160
organizations like the world trade
organization or Dow Chemical

10
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:35,040
again on international television full
the media for the world

11
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:39,300
and use their abilities to make
announcements that should have been made

12
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:40,469
to start with

13
00:00:40,469 --> 00:00:44,190
for instance I'm a chemical company that
was responsible for the deaths

14
00:00:44,190 --> 00:00:47,349
out tens of thousands of people in a
foreign country offering to make

15
00:00:47,350 --> 00:00:48,289
restitution

16
00:00:48,289 --> 00:00:51,590
well in real life they never did but in
the Yes Men world

17
00:00:51,590 --> 00:00:56,070
yes they did on the BBC and and then the
real company had to take it back so

18
00:00:56,070 --> 00:00:59,460
the statement was really made

19
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:03,579
its it's incredible what you can do with
imagination a little bit a courage

20
00:01:03,579 --> 00:01:07,170
and a community like this behind you on
so I'm

21
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:12,060
the Yes Men will be a appearing today
we're using a combination up from

22
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:15,159
up technology and and real-life about to

23
00:01:15,159 --> 00:01:18,479
to present this to you amazingly we we
usually have

24
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:21,740
network issues are one sort or another
or some kind of problem

25
00:01:21,740 --> 00:01:25,729
it's been going swimmingly well II big
and tall the network people for a

26
00:01:25,729 --> 00:01:31,930
keeping it going and

27
00:01:31,930 --> 00:01:36,250
I like unlike most yes-man appearances
which usually devolve into chaos because

28
00:01:36,250 --> 00:01:39,100
someone figures out that hey this isn't
really that supposed to be

29
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:42,810
are i think is gonna be kinda I
basically

30
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:47,020
I want a combat on it's going to be what
it is

31
00:01:47,020 --> 00:01:51,500
your yeah so without like to introduce
sandy from the Yes Men

32
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:58,500
scheme a big round of applause the

33
00:02:03,740 --> 00:02:05,840
thanks so much on

34
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:09,800
while its such a big crowd

35
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:13,290
and its the a bit daunting in very
flattering

36
00:02:13,290 --> 00:02:16,410
and that big honored to be here on

37
00:02:16,410 --> 00:02:20,200
you know we've been inspired by hacking

38
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:25,020
which has been around a 2600 and other

39
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:29,360
other hacking then things have been
around for a very long time and it's

40
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:30,680
been inspiring to us

41
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:34,590
I to see people messing with the system
in different ways

42
00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:38,200
and I think it's probably one of the
reasons we've ended up

43
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:41,989
doing what what we do on and it's only
recently

44
00:02:41,989 --> 00:02:46,660
dawned on me that what we do is actually
hacking believe it or not it took this

45
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:47,280
long

46
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:50,910
on what we do basically i think is

47
00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:54,570
is hack into mainstream journalism on

48
00:02:54,570 --> 00:02:58,730
we worked with mainstream journalists
essentially

49
00:02:58,730 --> 00:03:02,518
maybe it's social engineering up but
with their

50
00:03:02,519 --> 00:03:05,870
court's order on we give them

51
00:03:05,870 --> 00:03:09,650
most of them we give an excuse to cover
important issues that they wouldn't

52
00:03:09,650 --> 00:03:10,910
otherwise cover

53
00:03:10,910 --> 00:03:14,890
on issues that are desperately important
to get attention for

54
00:03:14,890 --> 00:03:18,720
on like the one that air a manual
mentioned

55
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:21,720
by on we work

56
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:25,170
with them by giving them funny jokes

57
00:03:25,170 --> 00:03:29,090
about to cover instead of the important
issue because they can't cover the

58
00:03:29,090 --> 00:03:30,950
important issue just cuz it's important

59
00:03:30,950 --> 00:03:36,360
on 20th anniversary of the Bhopal
catastrophe biggest industrial disaster

60
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:40,140
nobody ever compensated for it site not
cleaned up

61
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:44,000
not important by fake appearance on the
BBC

62
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,110
by somebody purporting to be from the
company did that that's

63
00:03:48,110 --> 00:03:52,350
important it's weird but that's the way
it works on

64
00:03:52,350 --> 00:03:55,400
and I think besides hackers on

65
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:59,739
one or the other things that has
inspired me personally has been acting

66
00:03:59,739 --> 00:04:00,070
up

67
00:04:00,070 --> 00:04:04,739
who you know in the nineties did amazing
things like covering jesse helms's house

68
00:04:04,739 --> 00:04:06,220
with the giant condom

69
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:12,400
on and stuff like that that basically
gave to the media no choice but to cover

70
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:12,780
it

71
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:16,190
was just too good a story on

72
00:04:16,190 --> 00:04:21,250
now our own kinda a voyage into
discovering this

73
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:26,010
started in 1999 and if we can have
PowerPoint

74
00:04:26,010 --> 00:04:29,730
on on the screen instead of me

75
00:04:29,730 --> 00:04:32,910
that's 1999 on

76
00:04:32,910 --> 00:04:37,020
a buncha people headed to Seattle to
protest the way to:

77
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:41,650
World Trade Organization and what it
represented which was the system %uh via

78
00:04:41,650 --> 00:04:45,240
free trade overall and an idea that

79
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:50,430
democracies never interfere with the
freedom of Commerce to do whatever it

80
00:04:50,430 --> 00:04:51,340
wants because

81
00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:54,330
you know we all know if you just let the
rich do whatever they want it'll turn

82
00:04:54,330 --> 00:04:55,960
out great for everyone

83
00:04:55,960 --> 00:05:01,120
on so this entire organization a pretty
big organization was created to you

84
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:06,130
promote and defend that idea and a lot
of people didn't like it

85
00:05:06,130 --> 00:05:08,979
including these people that you see in
the slide in about thirty thousand

86
00:05:08,979 --> 00:05:11,130
others who headed to Seattle

87
00:05:11,130 --> 00:05:15,760
in November of 1999 to shut down the the
World Trade Organization

88
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:19,380
and week we couldn't make it to that

89
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:23,260
so we did the next best thing or that
10th best thing

90
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:26,760
which was set up a fake website that
looked

91
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:30,449
just like the EE to's real website but

92
00:05:30,449 --> 00:05:35,600
had satirical content are some really
offensive content but basically

93
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:40,199
content that fat fell within the WT is
basic philosophy

94
00:05:40,199 --> 00:05:44,169
and we did that just because we happen
to be playing with website at the time

95
00:05:44,169 --> 00:05:48,130
I was a techie goes programmer and the

96
00:05:48,130 --> 00:05:52,370
so I you know enjoyed playing with
technology and was

97
00:05:52,370 --> 00:05:56,259
making fake little website and somebody
actually suggested that

98
00:05:56,259 --> 00:06:00,300
we try to make a fake for the PPT on I
thought why not

99
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:03,509
something on a great

100
00:06:03,509 --> 00:06:07,110
weird thing happened as a result of this
website though

101
00:06:07,110 --> 00:06:13,199
the EE to: itself posted a a press
release on its website saying

102
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:16,270
that it was terrible and this was at a
time

103
00:06:16,270 --> 00:06:20,070
23 November you can see the date there
was just before

104
00:06:20,070 --> 00:06:24,280
the these thirty thousand people were
gonna shut down the WT on everybody knew

105
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:25,130
it

106
00:06:25,130 --> 00:06:30,270
and the 2002 goes to devote a press
release to our website instead of them

107
00:06:30,270 --> 00:06:35,299
on nobody noticed there their press
release of course

108
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:38,400
and so ahead of their PR agency

109
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:42,480
on being very well educated and public
relations techniques

110
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:46,030
sent us an email and said you terrible
people have made us write a press

111
00:06:46,030 --> 00:06:49,210
release about you don't you feel ashamed
of yourselves

112
00:06:49,210 --> 00:06:52,350
and so we we were very ashamed and

113
00:06:52,350 --> 00:06:57,090
confessed our sense to about 10,000
journalists on our email list

114
00:06:57,090 --> 00:07:01,830
on which made a lot of people laugh a
lot of the journalists found it very

115
00:07:01,830 --> 00:07:04,700
funny that the wtoo was

116
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:08,420
going after the school website by some
people call the Yes Men

117
00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:11,880
on and as a result there was

118
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:14,909
a bit depressed on things like the

119
00:07:14,910 --> 00:07:18,380
Seattle PI which no longer exists

120
00:07:18,380 --> 00:07:23,630
on covered the issue and as a result I
got into whatever search engines there

121
00:07:23,630 --> 00:07:24,920
were at the time

122
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:28,750
think you guys probably remember a lot
better and I do

123
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:31,800
things are funny names Mike Lycos

124
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:35,210
and as a result on we started getting

125
00:07:35,210 --> 00:07:39,580
invitations to speak as the WT 0

126
00:07:39,580 --> 00:07:45,030
on because I've the search engine people
would stumble onto our fake website

127
00:07:45,030 --> 00:07:48,110
and on think it was the real thing and
we

128
00:07:48,110 --> 00:07:52,770
we started getting invitations as well
as a whole lot of other correspondence

129
00:07:52,770 --> 00:07:54,479
meant for the PPT oh so we were

130
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:57,900
answering really complicated trade
questions

131
00:07:57,900 --> 00:08:01,020
at the same time having our

132
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:05,210
a lot of fun doing that on the first
time we got this email asking for

133
00:08:05,210 --> 00:08:08,000
somebody from the TT 0 to speak at a
conference

134
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,110
talks about two months to answer it cuz
it was

135
00:08:11,110 --> 00:08:15,290
so weird and we didn't really imagine we
could do it but

136
00:08:15,290 --> 00:08:21,300
would finally accepted and it was for a
long conference in Salzburg Austria

137
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:25,110
and we presented a talk as the EE to:

138
00:08:25,110 --> 00:08:28,830
on in which the BTO basically says what

139
00:08:28,830 --> 00:08:32,049
okay we're privatizing most things and
that's great

140
00:08:32,049 --> 00:08:35,939
because you know we all know democracy
shouldn't interfere with business but

141
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:39,870
there's one thing we have a privatized
yet and that's democracy itself

142
00:08:39,870 --> 00:08:44,000
so let's let's try to do that and we
should start with the voting

143
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,720
and make it so that instead of
corporations paying

144
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:51,240
on you know money to political campaigns

145
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:54,500
which then pay people to make ads

146
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:57,920
and then pay people to put them on their
TV stations

147
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:01,639
I which then are supposed to convince
voters to vote for the candidate

148
00:09:01,639 --> 00:09:03,089
incredibly inefficient

149
00:09:03,089 --> 00:09:06,209
its like the perfect example
inefficiency in government

150
00:09:06,209 --> 00:09:10,190
let's just have a system online website

151
00:09:10,190 --> 00:09:14,430
you know web sites are amazing and you
can have the corporations just pay money

152
00:09:14,430 --> 00:09:16,170
directly to citizens

153
00:09:16,170 --> 00:09:19,389
on to vote for whoever they want and

154
00:09:19,389 --> 00:09:22,480
we have this whole diagram describing
the same people

155
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:27,440
on you know we kind of expected
something dramatic to happen so we on

156
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:30,649
we're prepared for anything we have a
camera man there in the whole thing

157
00:09:30,649 --> 00:09:35,060
and nothing happened I am

158
00:09:35,060 --> 00:09:40,149
and that was the first love many
experiences have nothing happening

159
00:09:40,149 --> 00:09:45,519
on the the next invitation we got was to
a textiles conference and the

160
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:50,800
temporary Finland it was a a conference
on textiles that the future

161
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:54,380
and so we decided okay it wasn't enough
to

162
00:09:54,380 --> 00:09:58,199
to to say the most grotesque thing we
could imagine now we've got to show

163
00:09:58,199 --> 00:10:01,680
a pretty grotesque saying and sense

164
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:04,959
manual mentioned balls I'm gonna show a
little clip

165
00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:08,279
that demonstrates what happened there we
are

166
00:10:08,279 --> 00:10:11,949
you know we thought well what what the
way to: going to speak at the tech South

167
00:10:11,949 --> 00:10:14,949
Conference what is the textiles up the
future

168
00:10:14,949 --> 00:10:19,130
for the WT 0 and the

169
00:10:19,130 --> 00:10:22,720
this is the result it's a a textile
solution

170
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:26,029
for one of the biggest problems in the
world I

171
00:10:26,029 --> 00:10:29,199
a world of absolutely free trade

172
00:10:29,199 --> 00:10:32,230
on its they you know you can hire people

173
00:10:32,230 --> 00:10:36,070
anywhere in the world at whatever wages
you want in transport the goods anywhere

174
00:10:36,070 --> 00:10:36,880
you want

175
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:40,339
but the people themselves I can't travel

176
00:10:40,339 --> 00:10:44,470
on and you know that that's that's okay
that's

177
00:10:44,470 --> 00:10:47,640
great there's only one problem with the
situation

178
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:50,960
and this is the problem

179
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:55,440
see

180
00:10:55,440 --> 00:11:00,210
no me we we have sound

181
00:11:00,210 --> 00:11:04,800
yes to the company might be in New York
Hong Kong or

182
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:08,190
Espoo Finland and the workers are in
gabon

183
00:11:08,190 --> 00:11:12,839
bring to or estonia how does the manager
maintain proper reporter

184
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:15,950
with the workers and how does he or she
answer from a distance that workers

185
00:11:15,950 --> 00:11:16,839
perform their work

186
00:11:16,839 --> 00:11:22,020
in an ethical fashion I'm about to show
you an actual prototype

187
00:11:22,020 --> 00:11:26,319
up the TTL solution to two major
management problems have today

188
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:29,800
now we all know that not even the best
workplace design can help even the most

189
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:31,500
astute manager keep track

190
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:34,690
workers what you need is a solution

191
00:11:34,690 --> 00:11:37,900
that enables complete report with
workers

192
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:41,480
especially when they're located far away
ok

193
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:48,480
like you help me on

194
00:11:58,370 --> 00:12:05,370
the

195
00:12:05,450 --> 00:12:08,770
thank you this is much better much more
comfortable

196
00:12:08,770 --> 00:12:12,930
is the third WTF answer to two of the
major

197
00:12:12,930 --> 00:12:17,030
management problems and we're calling it
the management Leisure Suit

198
00:12:17,030 --> 00:12:21,740
it's the the two problems again how to
maintain close rapport with just that

199
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:22,380
workers

200
00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:26,610
and how to remain comfortable and
increase leisure activities

201
00:12:26,610 --> 00:12:29,830
healthy management Leisure Suit work

202
00:12:29,830 --> 00:12:32,870
besides being extremely comfortable as I
can guarantee you

203
00:12:32,870 --> 00:12:36,010
well allow me to describe the strings

204
00:12:36,010 --> 00:12:43,010
or features the

205
00:12:59,119 --> 00:12:59,819
was

206
00:12:59,819 --> 00:13:02,959
this this

207
00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:06,860
is the EVA the employee

208
00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:11,160
visualization appendage it's an
instantly deployable

209
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:14,259
it now to devise the totally hands-free

210
00:13:14,259 --> 00:13:18,839
operation that allows the manager to see
his employees directly

211
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:23,499
right here signals communicating the
exact amount and quality of physical

212
00:13:23,499 --> 00:13:24,009
work

213
00:13:24,009 --> 00:13:27,240
are transmitted not only visually right
here but directly

214
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:30,459
for electric channels implanted directly
into the manager

215
00:13:30,459 --> 00:13:34,959
I the workers for their part are fitted
with corresponding transmitting

216
00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:39,290
chips that are implanting humanely
directly into the shoulder

217
00:13:39,290 --> 00:13:42,748
but the other equally important
achievement of the MLS

218
00:13:42,749 --> 00:13:45,759
has to do with leisure in the United
States

219
00:13:45,759 --> 00:13:49,149
leisure another word for freedom really
has the

220
00:13:49,149 --> 00:13:52,790
been decreasing steadily since the
nineteen seventies the management

221
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:53,599
Leisure Suit

222
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:56,769
permits the manager to reverse this
trend by letting him do his work

223
00:13:56,769 --> 00:14:00,929
anywhere while remaining in complete
touch with the workers

224
00:14:00,929 --> 00:14:04,459
physically sensing what's going on in
the workforce on the floor

225
00:14:04,459 --> 00:14:07,970
through channels implanted directly into
the manager again

226
00:14:07,970 --> 00:14:11,389
the managers is the employees but also
feels

227
00:14:11,389 --> 00:14:14,689
what they're feeling and confer left
where to focus

228
00:14:14,689 --> 00:14:17,868
in the workplace environment so

229
00:14:17,869 --> 00:14:21,369
in conclusion I'd like to ask is this

230
00:14:21,369 --> 00:14:28,369
a science fiction scenario on

231
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:33,400
the answer is No everything we've seen
here everything we've been talking about

232
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:37,280
is entirely possible today we can always
look forward

233
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:40,740
on the highways the progress towards
ever New Horizons

234
00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:44,940
with cooperation and ensure the light in
the fruits of prosperity

235
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:47,970
I'm very excited to be here thank you
very much

236
00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:54,970
by

237
00:14:58,220 --> 00:15:02,060
the thanks

238
00:15:02,060 --> 00:15:06,740
on afterwards the the president of the
conference ass for questions there

239
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:07,540
weren't any

240
00:15:07,540 --> 00:15:13,510
I and we actually spent the entire day
with these people and had dinner

241
00:15:13,510 --> 00:15:16,620
and I was seated across from the
daughter up the

242
00:15:16,620 --> 00:15:20,270
the the president and it was on it was
completely

243
00:15:20,270 --> 00:15:23,329
weird to to spend like

244
00:15:23,330 --> 00:15:26,950
and we went home in there was absolutely
no reaction but fortunately we have all

245
00:15:26,950 --> 00:15:27,670
this footage

246
00:15:27,670 --> 00:15:30,839
and on the local paper did cover

247
00:15:30,839 --> 00:15:33,980
a full-page photo up basically that

248
00:15:33,980 --> 00:15:37,930
on and describe the EE to: demonstrating
this

249
00:15:37,930 --> 00:15:41,500
this technology and and they got it

250
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:45,610
i mean that that newspaper got it and
made fun of it and he got a certain

251
00:15:45,610 --> 00:15:46,580
amount of press

252
00:15:46,580 --> 00:15:50,350
I'm so that was a sorta way that we have
a bit about

253
00:15:50,350 --> 00:15:54,220
that story into the media on Remo labor
and

254
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:57,230
the the inhumanity have

255
00:15:57,230 --> 00:16:00,339
outsourcing on our biggest kinda

256
00:16:00,339 --> 00:16:04,760
news hack came a few years later when
the

257
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:07,939
a friend of ours from Greenpeace

258
00:16:07,940 --> 00:16:11,830
suggested that we use these weird
talents that we

259
00:16:11,830 --> 00:16:15,690
seem to be developing to I go after a
real

260
00:16:15,690 --> 00:16:19,140
on the ground problem in Bhopal India

261
00:16:19,140 --> 00:16:22,779
I which a manual alluded to

262
00:16:22,779 --> 00:16:27,950
but in 1984 a big chemical plant
exploded their

263
00:16:27,950 --> 00:16:31,480
killing like three thousand people at
once and

264
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:34,910
a up to 20,000 people for the ensuing
years

265
00:16:34,910 --> 00:16:38,420
120 thousand people set for life the

266
00:16:38,420 --> 00:16:42,470
maximum anybody ever got for that was
five thousand dollar five hundred

267
00:16:42,470 --> 00:16:42,940
dollars

268
00:16:42,940 --> 00:16:46,779
sorry compensation and site itself was
never cleaned up

269
00:16:46,779 --> 00:16:50,310
so we r we thought that was terrible

270
00:16:50,310 --> 00:16:53,339
course and we set up a

271
00:16:53,339 --> 00:16:58,060
in 2001 another almoner puzzle a the
company that was responsible

272
00:16:58,060 --> 00:17:01,149
in 2001 was sold to Dow Chemical

273
00:17:01,149 --> 00:17:05,630
who continued to I refuse to do anything
about it

274
00:17:05,630 --> 00:17:09,350
so we did what we had to do set up a
website

275
00:17:09,349 --> 00:17:14,379
for Dow Chemical fake dal website sent
out a press release saying that

276
00:17:14,380 --> 00:17:20,419
on basically dow with never compensate
the people in Bhopal because the people

277
00:17:20,419 --> 00:17:21,309
in Bhopal

278
00:17:21,309 --> 00:17:25,270
too poor to be shareholders and that's
pretty much

279
00:17:25,270 --> 00:17:28,940
the truth and it didn't really get much
attention because thats

280
00:17:28,940 --> 00:17:33,669
true so arm it did get a little bit of
attention %uh there were a couple of

281
00:17:33,669 --> 00:17:34,410
articles

282
00:17:34,410 --> 00:17:38,270
couple blogs posted it and as a result
it did get in the search engines

283
00:17:38,270 --> 00:17:41,370
and two years later and intern

284
00:17:41,370 --> 00:17:44,900
and the BBC was searching up for

285
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:49,290
the Dow Chemical Company because it was
the 20th anniversary

286
00:17:49,290 --> 00:17:52,418
up the bulk of catastrophe and they
wanted to interview

287
00:17:52,419 --> 00:17:56,450
somebody from down to see what how they
were responding to these activists

288
00:17:56,450 --> 00:17:58,040
demands that they pay up

289
00:17:58,040 --> 00:18:02,159
and the intern stumbled on our side and

290
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:05,540
the BBC were extremely surprised that we
were

291
00:18:05,540 --> 00:18:09,350
very happy to go on and say and talk
because Dell

292
00:18:09,350 --> 00:18:14,159
never does agree to say anything and
first six minutes

293
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:18,300
in front of $350 million people I was
able to

294
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:22,570
basically go on and on and on about how
we were accepting full responsibility

295
00:18:22,570 --> 00:18:24,250
for the disaster

296
00:18:24,250 --> 00:18:29,790
I compensating the survivors liquidating
Union Carbide which we have pot

297
00:18:29,790 --> 00:18:33,090
and six minutes hitting all my talking
points

298
00:18:33,090 --> 00:18:36,939
and they were absolutely thrilled until
about 20 minutes later

299
00:18:36,940 --> 00:18:42,230
after the broadcast when they got a call
from Union Carbide saying that I didn't

300
00:18:42,230 --> 00:18:42,929
exist

301
00:18:42,929 --> 00:18:45,619
on

302
00:18:45,619 --> 00:18:48,649
couple funny things happen in that 20
minutes

303
00:18:48,649 --> 00:18:53,139
one was that the stock value of Dow lost
about two billion dollars

304
00:18:53,139 --> 00:18:57,290
by

305
00:18:57,290 --> 00:19:04,290
the

306
00:19:07,430 --> 00:19:11,250
you can always apply for that and I'm so
confused you should be blamed because it

307
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:11,950
says that

308
00:19:11,950 --> 00:19:16,330
if the company does the right thing they
get punished by the marketplace

309
00:19:16,330 --> 00:19:19,870
that's exactly what that demonstrated
and right after

310
00:19:19,870 --> 00:19:23,040
the announcement was revealed to be fake
and it was revealed that

311
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:26,830
now had absolutely zero intention of
doing anything of the sort

312
00:19:26,830 --> 00:19:30,199
the stock value came right back up who

313
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:31,240
okay now you can go

314
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:34,430
good the on

315
00:19:34,430 --> 00:19:38,160
so that that's one of the things that
happened another is that

316
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:42,630
after well it quickly shot up to be that
number one story on Google News

317
00:19:42,630 --> 00:19:46,800
and after the hoax was revealed which
with about an hour later

318
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:50,620
that story remained on Google miss at
the top for the rest of the day and

319
00:19:50,620 --> 00:19:52,740
there were something like six hundred
articles

320
00:19:52,740 --> 00:19:55,940
about the hoax on and therefore

321
00:19:55,940 --> 00:19:59,230
about the disaster and douse
responsibility and so on

322
00:19:59,230 --> 00:20:02,470
in the US press and that was really the
whole goal the action

323
00:20:02,470 --> 00:20:06,780
it was too get to give journalists an
excuse to talk about this incredibly

324
00:20:06,780 --> 00:20:07,629
important thing

325
00:20:07,630 --> 00:20:12,040
other that somehow just it being the
20th anniversary

326
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:16,149
wasn't enough arm so

327
00:20:16,150 --> 00:20:19,740
that was so successful and that was with
that was

328
00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:24,330
that we only did because the green peas
coming to us and saying why he do this

329
00:20:24,330 --> 00:20:28,419
and then they worked with us to craft
the point center to make it all happen

330
00:20:28,420 --> 00:20:32,840
so I we realize there was a lot of power
in working with

331
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:36,340
people who are smarter than us doing new
the issues to

332
00:20:36,340 --> 00:20:39,480
kinda could craft messages and figure it
all out

333
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:43,580
we didn't have to wing it ourselves we
could actually work with people who have

334
00:20:43,580 --> 00:20:44,020
done

335
00:20:44,020 --> 00:20:47,810
really important research and so we are

336
00:20:47,810 --> 00:20:51,270
we decided that that's how we would
operate from then on we

337
00:20:51,270 --> 00:20:54,410
with work with organisations

338
00:20:54,410 --> 00:20:58,490
on directly first collaboratively and
then we decided

339
00:20:58,490 --> 00:21:02,270
with work with organisations and
actually help them to carry out the

340
00:21:02,270 --> 00:21:02,970
project's

341
00:21:02,970 --> 00:21:06,530
entirely by themselves with a little bit
but it's a little bit of help

342
00:21:06,530 --> 00:21:10,080
and so we created an organization that
we call

343
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:13,990
the yes lab a hoops okay have been
hacked

344
00:21:13,990 --> 00:21:17,130
the policy or the other it is

345
00:21:17,130 --> 00:21:20,310
on if not the US Chamber of Commerce the
S lab

346
00:21:20,310 --> 00:21:24,000
and the this is a little video

347
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:28,040
about yes laughton and what does I'm

348
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:31,899

350
00:21:35,060 --> 00:21:38,909
or okay may have heard the S Pen because
of some other things we've done in the

351
00:21:38,910 --> 00:21:39,590
past

352
00:21:39,590 --> 00:21:42,740
like this and our is accepting

353
00:21:42,740 --> 00:21:47,650
full responsibility for the Bhopal
castro we want something that's going to

354
00:21:47,650 --> 00:21:49,200
be able to save a human being

355
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:52,620
no matter what Mother Nature throws out
a this

356
00:21:52,620 --> 00:21:56,060
is the answer iraq war ands

357
00:21:56,060 --> 00:22:00,280
1.2 million these fake papers printed
and passed out by

358
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:04,720
thousands of volunteers today we're
launching balls across america

359
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:08,650
may serve up Superior Court humor laced
with loosely to call the media's

360
00:22:08,650 --> 00:22:10,150
attention to serious issues

361
00:22:10,150 --> 00:22:15,120
who are you you're with a group of yes a
lot of people see the kind of things

362
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:16,370
we've been doing over the years

363
00:22:16,370 --> 00:22:21,000
and they want to do similar things for
their cars that's why we started the yes

364
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:21,730
lap

365
00:22:21,730 --> 00:22:24,830
yes lab is a way for us the SN

366
00:22:24,830 --> 00:22:28,220
to help all kinds of progressive
activist groups carry out when you're

367
00:22:28,220 --> 00:22:28,700
getting

368
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:33,010
creative actions here's how it works an
organization say

369
00:22:33,010 --> 00:22:36,260
US Uncut calls us up they have a goal

370
00:22:36,260 --> 00:22:39,890
say to point out that GE hasn't paid its
taxes

371
00:22:39,890 --> 00:22:43,470
together we brainstorm the best way for
the organization to get the most

372
00:22:43,470 --> 00:22:44,940
pressing tension possible

373
00:22:44,940 --> 00:22:47,990
then the organization works on the
project

374
00:22:47,990 --> 00:22:51,190
with their guidance finally the action
works

375
00:22:51,190 --> 00:22:56,640
and the organization gets its ideas out
in public

376
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:59,789
in this morning's story cross the
Associated Press saying a general

377
00:22:59,789 --> 00:23:01,158

00:43:59,240 --> 00:44:02,720
recommendation for the chief NC the me
March

677
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:06,290

fantastic initiative

678
00:44:06,290 --> 00:44:10,790
he would indeed he wouldn't do you
needed the Macy's parade

679
00:44:10,790 --> 00:44:14,029
thing while ago so he's still alive pair
how how

680
00:44:14,030 --> 00:44:17,859
despite having done enough coke to kill
several horses

681
00:44:17,859 --> 00:44:20,930

682
00:44:20,930 --> 00:44:26,859

and

686
00:44:38,650 --> 00:44:42,030
September there will not be a soviet
forcing

687
00:44:42,030 --> 00:44:45,200

688
00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:51,410
well yet okay we might have a soviet
forcing it out ideas but maybe a smaller

689
00:44:51,410 --> 00:44:51,720
one

690
00:44:51,720 --> 00:44:56,270
I will be a smaller group I'll be less
mortifying to be forced her to have an

691
00:44:56,270 --> 00:44:57,420
ID in front of everybody

fistfights maybe well okay there will be
fisting

694
00:45:04,120 --> 00:45:07,520
fire K earnings

695
00:45:07,520 --> 00:45:12,030
for democracy now consensus

696
00:45:12,030 --> 00:45:18,350

what we do how we do it

703
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:47,260
on how this happens what's going on on
the screen right now

704
00:45:47,260 --> 00:45:50,460
I N of please a

705
00:45:50,460 --> 00:45:55,890
feel free to ask and there's more videos
to show you as answers

706
00:45:55,890 --> 00:46:02,890
if we don't have the answers communion i
think is the answer to the first

707
00:46:08,100 --> 00:46:08,870
question

708
00:46:08,870 --> 00:46:15,390
now not used to this world your ways are
strange to me

709
00:46:15,390 --> 00:46:19,600
I asked another question

710
00:46:19,600 --> 00:46:22,870
oh yeah as as me to stand so I know on

711
00:46:22,870 --> 00:46:26,009
you are you at least one abuse to lead
with academia somehow

712
00:46:26,010 --> 00:46:29,230
and I'm sorta wondering on howie's or to
balance I

713
00:46:29,230 --> 00:46:33,530
lives activists with your life as an
academic and I hate how you keep people

714
00:46:33,530 --> 00:46:35,060
from firing you when you do

715
00:46:35,060 --> 00:46:40,410
these incredible things I will not
answer that question because it doesn't

716
00:46:40,410 --> 00:46:41,440
apply to me at all

717
00:46:41,440 --> 00:46:44,670
thank you but your you're not

718
00:46:44,670 --> 00:46:48,550
you're not a doctor if something and

719
00:46:48,550 --> 00:46:53,010
biking and you can go canes I can answer
I can answer that question um

720
00:46:53,010 --> 00:46:56,290
I think that the answer is that you
don't people

721
00:46:56,290 --> 00:46:59,750
keep people from firing you on they do

722
00:46:59,750 --> 00:47:04,170
occasionally but on they haven't lately
fired and the

723
00:47:04,170 --> 00:47:07,980
and they haven't fired me ever from

724
00:47:07,980 --> 00:47:11,610
because they also you too like what we
do there and

725
00:47:11,610 --> 00:47:16,140
kind tough situation because they want
some amount of attention in prestige in

726
00:47:16,140 --> 00:47:17,960
some circles there is a tension

727
00:47:17,960 --> 00:47:21,520
Lopresti is all that long do I'm also

728
00:47:21,520 --> 00:47:24,620
to our credit um price it she said
you're

729
00:47:24,620 --> 00:47:28,650
credits to display it never actually
been arrested for doing that said

730
00:47:28,650 --> 00:47:32,030
things that we do wouldn't charge we
have been seeing once but everybody can

731
00:47:32,030 --> 00:47:32,850
see

732
00:47:32,850 --> 00:47:35,850
I mean come on that's nothing to be
afraid of or to think

733
00:47:35,850 --> 00:47:40,020
is army means that you doing anything
illegal but doesn't that just means you

734
00:47:40,020 --> 00:47:40,920
can see

735
00:47:40,920 --> 00:47:44,090
so I think that you know overall

736
00:47:44,090 --> 00:47:47,480
its a you know they don't own any reason
the fires

737
00:47:47,480 --> 00:47:51,410
said so I mean we have been transplanted
although he did if you don't show up to

738
00:47:51,410 --> 00:47:52,020
work

739
00:47:52,020 --> 00:47:55,460
then they have a very good excuse to
fire you so I recommend that you are

740
00:47:55,460 --> 00:47:55,870
Nick

741
00:47:55,870 --> 00:48:00,130
making things like that and just you
know show up to work teaching classes

742
00:48:00,130 --> 00:48:03,610
and then it probably won't learn your I
mean what's the best

743
00:48:03,610 --> 00:48:06,920
Erie anything in this world wonders was
less it

744
00:48:06,920 --> 00:48:10,320
doesn't mean that the I mean it very
plain people monastic very very

745
00:48:10,320 --> 00:48:13,400
you know very well-known a

746
00:48:13,400 --> 00:48:17,110
fantastic activists in you know

747
00:48:17,110 --> 00:48:21,580
a trance stocks business a good example
she was

748
00:48:21,580 --> 00:48:25,770
like girls from Boston University in the
and 1980

749
00:48:25,770 --> 00:48:30,500
resolve lunch people have been fired
because their politics and so that's

750
00:48:30,500 --> 00:48:31,440
what is the 10-year

751
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:36,280
system neither that are always works
limits but then there's also

752
00:48:36,280 --> 00:48:39,440
many of the younger generation of us are
having to the advance

753
00:48:39,440 --> 00:48:42,630
where we are much more unstable to begin
with and so

754
00:48:42,630 --> 00:48:45,710
that's concerned I don't know if you
guys wanna dress that is just deal that

755
00:48:45,710 --> 00:48:47,570
will work a slightly different to
relocate

756
00:48:47,570 --> 00:48:51,300
only let me say put it this way then I
think that

757
00:48:51,300 --> 00:48:54,480
the rices and inspired

758
00:48:54,480 --> 00:48:58,100
are in some ways unknowns you won't know
if you're going to be fired by doing

759
00:48:58,100 --> 00:48:59,110
something into the

760
00:48:59,110 --> 00:49:02,290
do it its it's a total question mark and
you can't

761
00:49:02,290 --> 00:49:06,160
you can't be on men your behavior

762
00:49:06,160 --> 00:49:09,250
if you know what you're doing is right
based on a climate of fear

763
00:49:09,250 --> 00:49:14,550
it just won't work because you never
know here

764
00:49:14,550 --> 00:49:18,950
you get tired the worst thing that
happens you lose your job I think

765
00:49:18,950 --> 00:49:22,490
on and chances are that the intention
was generated by that

766
00:49:22,490 --> 00:49:25,500
home up again on edge so

767
00:49:25,500 --> 00:49:28,590
I yep that's my you know unless you
basically

768
00:49:28,590 --> 00:49:32,450
like and really really really tell
situation personally

769
00:49:32,450 --> 00:49:36,510
um I would say that interests I being
fired

770
00:49:36,510 --> 00:49:40,190
are very slim energy interests in

771
00:49:40,190 --> 00:49:43,300
doing what you really need to say and do

772
00:49:43,300 --> 00:49:46,780
exercising freedom of speech that's
rough in

773
00:49:46,780 --> 00:49:50,140
is in today's economy but I'll go ahead
and take and an appeal something thanks

774
00:49:50,140 --> 00:49:57,140
vision hai AR

775
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:01,900

economic warfare

776

price on these companies

781
00:50:20,070 --> 00:50:25,360
on it plummeted hours after you press
release if you work with hedge funds you

782
00:50:25,360 --> 00:50:28,890
let's be honest all I care about is
making money they don't care that your

783
00:50:28,890 --> 00:50:31,210
progressive group necessarily

784
00:50:31,210 --> 00:50:34,770
they could they could work with you to
you

785
00:50:34,770 --> 00:50:38,520
really drive that stock price down if
you have a two-hour movement down its

786
00:50:38,520 --> 00:50:39,259
stock price

787
00:50:39,260 --> 00:50:43,000
and you have a watch headphones by input
of the same time

788
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:46,300
it builds upon itself hmm and I dwell

789
00:50:46,300 --> 00:50:50,410
you know I I don't think they're dead
any amount Herve

790
00:50:50,410 --> 00:50:53,480
that sort of pressure can really make a
difference

791
00:50:53,480 --> 00:50:57,080
arm I think you could make a momentary
difference someone company

792
00:50:57,080 --> 00:51:00,299
but the actual problem is the system

793
00:51:00,300 --> 00:51:03,690
that allows companies to get away with
murder literally

794
00:51:03,690 --> 00:51:08,280
and not not you know see the stock value
go up as a result

795
00:51:08,280 --> 00:51:11,340
until we change that until we well

796
00:51:11,340 --> 00:51:14,940
one start would be to get money out of
politics you now then

797
00:51:14,940 --> 00:51:18,220
we would have a lot less about

798
00:51:18,220 --> 00:51:23,120
arm and there are different ways to do
that you can get money out of politics

799
00:51:23,120 --> 00:51:26,970
and that makes a real difference across
the board and then companies can't spend

800
00:51:26,970 --> 00:51:28,560
billions of dollars

801
00:51:28,560 --> 00:51:32,540
for example cell just spent four billion
dollars lobbying in campaigning to be

802
00:51:32,540 --> 00:51:33,430
allowed

803
00:51:33,430 --> 00:51:37,060
to drill in the Arctic you know that's
that's an example of money in politics

804
00:51:37,060 --> 00:51:37,710
the

805
00:51:37,710 --> 00:51:41,050
the Arctic is now melted enough that

806
00:51:41,050 --> 00:51:45,520
shell can go drill for oil up there on

807
00:51:45,520 --> 00:51:50,590
wrong response I by and that's that's
pretty offensive to a lot of people

808
00:51:50,590 --> 00:51:52,920
including people in government but

809
00:51:52,920 --> 00:51:56,490
because cell could spend four billion
dollars on lobbying they managed to get

810
00:51:56,490 --> 00:51:58,950
it approved by the Obama administration

811
00:51:58,950 --> 00:52:02,220
on when when you can stop that sorta
thing

812
00:52:02,220 --> 00:52:06,480
then you can make a real difference on
get bringing down one company like

813
00:52:06,480 --> 00:52:09,500
coke which I'm sure does terrible things
and you know our

814
00:52:09,500 --> 00:52:12,700
any one of these banks that does
terrible things on

815
00:52:12,700 --> 00:52:16,630
that that's great but one thing that
does is send a message that it's just a

816
00:52:16,630 --> 00:52:18,560
few bad apples whereas it's not

817
00:52:18,560 --> 00:52:21,600
it's the entire system yet another

818
00:52:21,600 --> 00:52:24,800
that wasn't actually mad what was that
like if u

819
00:52:24,800 --> 00:52:28,500
if you do that to one company in it
sends the message

820
00:52:28,500 --> 00:52:31,940
potentially to the other companies not
all companies are susceptible

821
00:52:31,940 --> 00:52:35,630
to what I'm talkin runs on what you said
it's not gonna make well that's been

822
00:52:35,630 --> 00:52:37,120
done actually are

823
00:52:37,120 --> 00:52:40,589
some companies are more South that
something you can't ask like there have

824
00:52:40,590 --> 00:52:43,090
been boycotts that have really hurt
certain companies

825
00:52:43,090 --> 00:52:46,710
has it actually stopped other companies
from doing terrible things now

826
00:52:46,710 --> 00:52:50,250
so it's you know to really change things

827
00:52:50,250 --> 00:52:55,270
to really change things we have to do we
have to have systemic legislative

828
00:52:55,270 --> 00:52:59,090
changers like either a constitutional
amendment us

829
00:52:59,090 --> 00:53:02,510
to stop corporate person hurts to see
say that

830
00:53:02,510 --> 00:53:06,010
corporations don't have the right to
people which that's a tall order

831
00:53:06,010 --> 00:53:10,610
or even something like an FCC disclaimer
on the front of political ads

832
00:53:10,610 --> 00:53:13,760
just like you have you now on
disclaimers on

833
00:53:13,760 --> 00:53:17,000
on medical and some ads for
pharmaceuticals that say the side

834
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:18,270
effects why not have

835
00:53:18,270 --> 00:53:21,520
a FCC requirement that if you put on an
ad

836
00:53:21,520 --> 00:53:25,530
for campaign or whatever you have to
disclose exactly who's paying for it and

837
00:53:25,530 --> 00:53:27,780
who's behind who's paying for it

838
00:53:27,780 --> 00:53:31,630
and you know have real clarity about
what you're seeing

839
00:53:31,630 --> 00:53:34,890
right now we don't have that and that
would be really just a value measure

840
00:53:34,890 --> 00:53:35,819
would fix it

841
00:53:35,820 --> 00:53:40,280
but would be something so there are
these things that would systematically

842
00:53:40,280 --> 00:53:43,800
improve the situation I think going
after individual companies and trying to

843
00:53:43,800 --> 00:53:45,260
send them a message

844
00:53:45,260 --> 00:53:50,850
is like you know it's a big christians
about like thinking they're better sides

845
00:53:50,850 --> 00:53:54,440
will win out in the other companies will
you not do the right thing cuz they see

846
00:53:54,440 --> 00:53:57,810
they're in trouble or whenever it's not
can't rely on their

847
00:53:57,810 --> 00:54:02,320
conscience or even their fear I just
izle like fighting fire with fire by

848
00:54:02,320 --> 00:54:07,230

toothbrushing law

882
00:56:07,010 --> 00:56:10,710
is about the secret enter pleas kicking
down your door 3 a.m. to make sure you

883
00:56:10,710 --> 00:56:11,230
brushed

886
00:56:19,640 --> 00:56:23,509

I like I turn Randall Terry K

908
00:57:45,730 --> 00:57:49,100
I another question yes it is amazing to
me

909
00:57:49,100 --> 00:57:52,200
that you any can appear before group

910
00:57:52,200 --> 00:57:56,280
inflated giant dong and not provoke any
kind of a response

911
00:57:56,280 --> 00:57:59,600
do you have any thoughts about the
psychological dynamics

912
00:57:59,600 --> 00:58:03,800
those groups and what's going on in
their heads arm

913
00:58:03,800 --> 00:58:08,430
world is

914
00:58:08,430 --> 00:58:11,640
and and Mike go by since here well

915
00:58:11,640 --> 00:58:15,140
all-star I'll finish on yeah it's not

916
00:58:15,140 --> 00:58:18,799
its it's not that unusual if you think
about it

917
00:58:18,800 --> 00:58:24,240
the they're there to see somebody from
the World Trade Organization

918
00:58:24,240 --> 00:58:29,810
oz speak and you now the program says
that's who they're seeing and they just

919
00:58:29,810 --> 00:58:34,000
accept whatever the person same on you
you doing something that's

920
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:37,650
calculated to be as absurd as you can
imagine yeah and there now

921
00:58:37,650 --> 00:58:41,420
reacting brain well they should react i
mean they should

922
00:58:41,420 --> 00:58:44,180
they should think this is really
offensive in this is wrong and a couple

923
00:58:44,180 --> 00:58:45,340
other people in the audience

924
00:58:45,340 --> 00:58:48,380
actually did come up afterwards and said
that was

925
00:58:48,380 --> 00:58:52,720
really weird and one woman was actually
offended because it implied that only

926
00:58:52,720 --> 00:58:54,880
men could be factory owners

927
00:58:54,880 --> 00:58:58,410
on that

928
00:58:58,410 --> 00:59:01,790
wasn't exactly the message we were
aiming for but that is also yeah

929
00:59:01,790 --> 00:59:05,430
that was offensive on

930
00:59:05,430 --> 00:59:08,910
but the no I think I think it's like

931
00:59:08,910 --> 00:59:13,240
that the problem isn't that people just
watch it and believe it's the way to:

932
00:59:13,240 --> 00:59:16,990
that that seems normal that you know we
we know how to suspend our disbelief and

933
00:59:16,990 --> 00:59:17,800
if it says that

934
00:59:17,800 --> 00:59:21,490
something that we just go through and
believe it but yeah but nobody would

935
00:59:21,490 --> 00:59:23,280
object to that

936
00:59:23,280 --> 00:59:26,630
on a party that might be that the people
in the audience there there

937
00:59:26,630 --> 00:59:30,120
in that world where the way to: is very
important and

938
00:59:30,120 --> 00:59:34,250
there they don't see have anything to
gain by opposing an Airbus

939
00:59:34,250 --> 00:59:37,540
you know shouting something in the
middle of a conference and stopping

940
00:59:37,540 --> 00:59:38,509
things er

941
00:59:38,510 --> 00:59:42,980
or you know animating those brain cells
that might be critical of it

942
00:59:42,980 --> 00:59:46,210
on so the real message about for us

943
00:59:46,210 --> 00:59:49,420
showing that is not those people are
stupid

944
00:59:49,420 --> 00:59:52,790
because they're not they have PHD's in
there there quite smart people in the

945
00:59:52,790 --> 00:59:53,600
audience

946
00:59:53,600 --> 00:59:58,150
the real message will is on we can't
trust other people

947
00:59:58,150 --> 01:00:03,020
to make sure that things aren't going
haywire and that it's only people's only

948
01:00:03,020 --> 01:00:04,270
democracy

949
01:00:04,270 --> 01:00:08,780
that can wacho you know you can't like
trust the corporations are going to do

950
01:00:08,780 --> 01:00:09,920
the right thing

951
01:00:09,920 --> 01:00:13,210
even with pressure they need a lot of
pressure

952
01:00:13,210 --> 01:00:16,690
and it's actually you know he can't
trust the politicians are going to do

953
01:00:16,690 --> 01:00:18,070
the right thing either

954
01:00:18,070 --> 01:00:22,000
on just because you left them and they
seem okay when you elect them

955
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:26,050
on which is a story about this since not
only the size became the a slob

956
01:00:26,050 --> 01:00:29,090
have a bunch of these newspapers here on

957
01:00:29,090 --> 01:00:33,810
and where asking for a small donation
that will support the a slab

958
01:00:33,810 --> 01:00:37,110
on but we publish these

959
01:00:37,110 --> 01:00:40,610
in per without power for Scott and Liz
over there

960
01:00:40,610 --> 01:00:43,880
on they a a week after the

961
01:00:43,880 --> 01:00:47,060
on victory from evil twin

962
01:00:47,060 --> 01:00:50,799
booking a week after the election
victory on

963
01:00:50,800 --> 01:00:55,880
this newspaper came out the media
reported 1.2 million copies

964
01:00:55,880 --> 01:00:59,700
thanks to Scott it was actually 80,000
copies

965
01:00:59,700 --> 01:01:04,220
in New York City thanks guys was
actually very important

966
01:01:04,220 --> 01:01:07,560
on 80,000 copies in New York City this
fake

967
01:01:07,560 --> 01:01:11,029
New York Times that announced that the
Iraq war was over

968
01:01:11,030 --> 01:01:15,720
om you know we were building a scene
economy by establishing a maximum wage

969
01:01:15,720 --> 01:01:17,540
law for CEOs

970
01:01:17,540 --> 01:01:21,380
om et cetera et cetera all kinds of
great news

971
01:01:21,380 --> 01:01:25,130
I'm in the the whole message ovett was
that these things only happen because

972
01:01:25,130 --> 01:01:29,650
people I took to the streets and kept up
the pressure that

973
01:01:29,650 --> 01:01:34,710
they had used to get Obama elected all
the energy behind the election

974
01:01:34,710 --> 01:01:39,510
was actually sustained and this man they
liked it had to do the right thing

975
01:01:39,510 --> 01:01:40,160
afterwards

976
01:01:40,160 --> 01:01:43,330
was a fictitious six months in the
future view

977
01:01:43,330 --> 01:01:47,730
that of course hasn't quite come true
yet

978
01:01:47,730 --> 01:01:51,670
I'll

979
01:01:51,670 --> 01:01:54,870
thank you p

980
01:01:54,870 --> 01:01:57,970
kill you this

981
01:01:57,970 --> 01:02:01,890
is there anybody else they might cure

982
01:02:01,890 --> 01:02:05,129
me I'm

983
01:02:05,130 --> 01:02:09,600
or reporting is for all Americans

984
01:02:09,600 --> 01:02:12,620
this next either

985
01:02:12,620 --> 01:02:16,850
%uh I can't help but notice he didn't
even know that

986
01:02:16,850 --> 01:02:19,950
either again help but notice that you
guys seem

987
01:02:19,950 --> 01:02:24,490
extremely legit and I was wondering if
you could go into some the techniques

988
01:02:24,490 --> 01:02:27,700
even played in the in seemingly

989
01:02:27,700 --> 01:02:30,870
yeah on well I don't know that we seem
legit

990
01:02:30,870 --> 01:02:34,290
we do it we have evolved some techniques
on

991
01:02:34,290 --> 01:02:38,940
the main thing we due to seem legit is

992
01:02:38,940 --> 01:02:43,860
act like we are on paper we is press
release is basically

993
01:02:43,860 --> 01:02:48,160
on and we do have a few other secrets
like how to appear at conferences and

994
01:02:48,160 --> 01:02:48,660
how to get

995
01:02:48,660 --> 01:02:52,100
and you know basic social engineering
that I think

996
01:02:52,100 --> 01:02:55,960
many of the people here could figure out
a lot better ways to do it than we have

997
01:02:55,960 --> 01:02:59,040
but what we have learned we've posted
online /a

998
01:02:59,040 --> 01:03:02,120
yes lapd artwork slash cookbook

999
01:03:02,120 --> 01:03:05,819
it's a it's not linked anywhere so if
you wanna see after remember that whole

1000
01:03:05,820 --> 01:03:06,570
URL

1001
01:03:06,570 --> 01:03:11,510
yes lab .org slash cookbook arm but the
main technique that uses the press

1002
01:03:11,510 --> 01:03:12,690
release

1003
01:03:12,690 --> 01:03:16,750
and also a couple of times the video
news release regis produce

1004
01:03:16,750 --> 01:03:22,090
news on you write the news are you make
a a video of the news

1005
01:03:22,090 --> 01:03:25,730
the you'd like to see and you work
backwards from there

1006
01:03:25,730 --> 01:03:29,300
okay what you actually have to do to
make an interesting news article

1007
01:03:29,300 --> 01:03:33,490
that's basically the secretive what we
do

1008
01:03:33,490 --> 01:03:38,110
period thank you thanks

1009
01:03:38,110 --> 01:03:41,730
and bake the my question a it's a little
beat

1010
01:03:41,730 --> 01:03:44,910
a foreign for me to little to

1011
01:03:44,910 --> 01:03:48,210
be a fee candid there is something like
that too little completely understand

1012
01:03:48,210 --> 01:03:49,650
that concept but

1013
01:03:49,650 --> 01:03:53,490
Anna my question would be a actually
political one

1014
01:03:53,490 --> 01:03:57,140
local it tourism in the West exactly did
you form beasts

1015
01:03:57,140 --> 01:04:01,000
it's very you know they're the best hip
least send a good camp to the city he

1016
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:02,980
criticized the bed cable is to become

1017
01:04:02,980 --> 01:04:07,400
good capitalists but is in all capital
is bullshit beards and should be

1018
01:04:07,400 --> 01:04:10,870
collect be a little bit more had on I'll

1019
01:04:10,870 --> 01:04:14,299
not the not the that reform Easton

1020
01:04:14,300 --> 01:04:17,830
change the with you can change in with
the attorney will be debated

1021
01:04:17,830 --> 01:04:23,259
you the air

1022
01:04:23,260 --> 01:04:27,800
yes why I love the I love what Frances
Fox Piven says about that

1023
01:04:27,800 --> 01:04:31,070
on she's if you've ever read her %uh

1024
01:04:31,070 --> 01:04:34,240
says incredibly powerful writer on

1025
01:04:34,240 --> 01:04:38,490
book called more people's movements for
example she talks about riots and how

1026
01:04:38,490 --> 01:04:41,880
you actually have to take to the streets
sometimes and you know when

1027
01:04:41,880 --> 01:04:47,040
like in the 30's on all this so popular
pressure that basically force

1028
01:04:47,040 --> 01:04:50,150
result to pass the New Deal on

1029
01:04:50,150 --> 01:04:54,060
goes into a lot of detail that and but

1030
01:04:54,060 --> 01:04:57,990
aster a similar question like what do we
do now everything

1031
01:04:57,990 --> 01:05:01,820
totally everything seems completely
messed up

1032
01:05:01,820 --> 01:05:05,650
and you know do we need revolution ur

1033
01:05:05,650 --> 01:05:08,970
why I mean on and she said well

1034
01:05:08,970 --> 01:05:11,760
there are a lot of ways that things can
get better and there are a lot of

1035
01:05:11,760 --> 01:05:12,890
reforms that can

1036
01:05:12,890 --> 01:05:17,240
happen by you actually need
revolutionary action to get those

1037
01:05:17,240 --> 01:05:18,070
reforms

1038
01:05:18,070 --> 01:05:23,390
cell now we can't necessarily just tear
down the system and start again

1039
01:05:23,390 --> 01:05:26,609
that might not even be desirable because
who knows what happens but

1040
01:05:26,610 --> 01:05:31,860
you do need to actually take action
that's pretty revolutionary

1041
01:05:31,860 --> 01:05:35,860
to get him and got him world girl team

1042
01:05:35,860 --> 01:05:39,140
yeah basically this a

1043
01:05:39,140 --> 01:05:43,109
ok I accepted as a statement also angle
completely believe it

1044
01:05:43,110 --> 01:05:46,500
the okie not just in case anyone was

1045
01:05:46,500 --> 01:05:50,170
wants to commit a felony I have still
special immigration stempel so good at

6:30 you bring me your password

1047
01:05:52,160 --> 01:05:55,970
else then beat it's really a fake a
felony and it's the cheapest

1048
01:05:55,970 --> 01:06:00,860
you get to the thank you arm wonderful
