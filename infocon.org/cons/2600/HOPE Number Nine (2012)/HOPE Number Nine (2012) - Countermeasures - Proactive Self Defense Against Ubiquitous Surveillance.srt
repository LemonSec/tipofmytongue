do a lot of work shops here too

10
00:00:42,199 --> 00:00:45,660
I'm gonna hardware hacking area

00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:49,470
the the mezzanine level and in at nine

12
00:00:49,470 --> 00:00:53,699
in hackers base village area on and also
on the six floor

13
00:00:53,699 --> 00:00:57,330
there's two rooms known as the Paris
room in Budapest room

14
00:00:57,330 --> 00:01:02,000
and a it's been really blinded good
hands-on workshops going on there

15
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,970
this morning there are two on

16
00:01:05,970 --> 00:01:09,950
one-inch called morning healing really
not about hockey with the hacking your

17
00:01:09,950 --> 00:01:10,479
own

18
00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:13,860
your and physiological are being

19
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:17,820
on so any malcolm she is teaching that

20
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:21,110
and it's a basically two its internal

21
00:01:21,110 --> 00:01:26,160
well-being type of thing senate really
good at nine needed after last night I'm

22
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:27,289
that's a 10 o'clock

23
00:01:27,290 --> 00:01:31,520
on the six floor and also this morning
from 10 a.m. all the way to 1 p.m.

24
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:35,070
its whatever floating thing come in when
you want but I don't show up after 12

25
00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:39,090
is there FCC amateur radio

26
00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:44,020
examinations I ham radio stuff we have a
station set up on the 64

27
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:47,380
a special cause an issue to it by the
Federal Communications Commission

28
00:01:47,380 --> 00:01:50,530
and nine each for this event with the
plan

29
00:01:50,530 --> 00:01:55,130
this past week and we've communicated
with the in 15 or 20 but nearly fifteen

30
00:01:55,130 --> 00:01:55,420
a

31
00:01:55,420 --> 00:01:58,870
other countries with about with just a
few want to power

32
00:01:58,870 --> 00:02:02,060
I'll Mosby data communications on

33
00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:05,500
cuba Czech Republic Russia Costa Rica

34
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:09,679
Argentina much more are those be great
medications

35
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:12,750
using no infrastructure between

36
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:16,330
morning point B pretty interesting on
sale show up

37
00:02:16,330 --> 00:02:19,580
you big thank you have no chance and
help pass in this thing

38
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:23,120
but you'd be surprised to get a count on
these tests a few years ago

39
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:26,659
for in a mine anybody can believe it so
where

40
00:02:26,659 --> 00:02:29,730
go down there and give it a shot after
this talk good and they're

41
00:02:29,730 --> 00:02:33,090
six more is fifteen dollars which in fcc
v

42
00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:37,439
and take the bank got nothing to lose
and is the closest thing we have to

43
00:02:37,439 --> 00:02:42,370
to government-sponsored hacking I think
a ham radio how brazen the hacking the

44
00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:43,549
radio spectrum for

45
00:02:43,549 --> 00:02:47,379
over a century its it's a really awesome
community into a lot with it when all

46
00:02:47,379 --> 00:02:49,149
each other communications made sales

47
00:02:49,150 --> 00:02:54,400
this works so on turned right on about
that but it's a it's important part of

48
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:55,060
our community

49
00:02:55,060 --> 00:02:59,060
I'm decided to park is about avoiding

50
00:02:59,060 --> 00:03:02,419
you bakeries surveillance being or
becoming aware there

51
00:03:02,419 --> 00:03:05,650
and what you can do to avoid everywhere
you go

52
00:03:05,650 --> 00:03:10,010
in hotel Pennsylvania out in the streets
on there are

53
00:03:10,010 --> 00:03:13,899
racially countless forms have
surveillance technology

54
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:18,430
or pointed at us Anna you now have my
money the records

55
00:03:18,430 --> 00:03:23,359
is there one out when everybody had to
get your paranoia is just good thinking

56
00:03:23,359 --> 00:03:27,099
doctor don t be heard if you care be on
severn

57
00:03:27,099 --> 00:03:32,079
I always remember that when I get when I
see Perry's rise and communications in a

58
00:03:32,079 --> 00:03:35,799
in public areas so out without further
ado annie cruz said

59
00:03:35,799 --> 00:03:40,699
great Kante and Lisa Shea are both have
been with West Point for about a decade

60
00:03:40,699 --> 00:03:44,180
teaching about this stuff they both
academics be really know their topic we

61
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:47,290
had lease on off the hook on the radio
show last week talking about her

62
00:03:47,290 --> 00:03:50,840
week before last was in year and

63
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:54,829
but two days ago and Adam she really
year she really AM

64
00:03:54,829 --> 00:03:58,340
explained a lot about what we should
beware if I wasn't aware

65
00:03:58,340 --> 00:04:05,340
so had a great time thanks thanks very
much bernie & I just as a side note

66
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:11,680
Gregoire both ham radio operators

67
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:15,120
for but that's where I'm

68
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:18,500
so as as bernie mentioned we are both

69
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:22,199
instructors at West Point we are blessed
with academic freedom we

70
00:04:22,199 --> 00:04:26,169
we teach at West Point on but these are
our own personal view is that we're

71
00:04:26,169 --> 00:04:27,250
giving you their not

72
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:31,639
necessarily the views have West Point
the DOD Department the army

73
00:04:31,639 --> 00:04:35,319
United government ernie any other formal
entity on

74
00:04:35,319 --> 00:04:39,889
and and context matters somebody's
things that were going to tell you about

75
00:04:39,889 --> 00:04:43,129
may not be legal to do in all places so

76
00:04:43,129 --> 00:04:46,220
on common sense prevails were not out
here to get

77
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:50,470
anybody in trouble especially ourselves
arm we're not lawyers either

78
00:04:50,470 --> 00:04:54,379
we're were computer scientist analytical
engineers and ham radio operators

79
00:04:54,379 --> 00:04:58,740
so but we really want you to get on this
talk

80
00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:03,180
are basically three things one that
network surveillance systems

81
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:06,340
are out there there's lots of them were
under them

82
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:11,210
even as we speak now are big can
threaten our privacy and our way of life

83
00:05:11,210 --> 00:05:11,609
there

84
00:05:11,610 --> 00:05:16,960
that we enjoy individuals can and should
take steps to protect yourselves

85
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:20,500
some its common sense movements more
than common sense

86
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:24,460
but especially in this audience with
olive you

87
00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:29,109
this community has the opportunity the
knowledge the status

88
00:05:29,110 --> 00:05:32,900
the networking specialist social
networking to do more than just protect

89
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:33,689
yourselves

90
00:05:33,689 --> 00:05:40,689
you can deflect the trajectory this
surveilled future

91
00:05:41,530 --> 00:05:47,190
serving

92
00:05:47,190 --> 00:05:49,110
so is a burning wood burning mentioned

93
00:05:49,110 --> 00:05:53,050
you have to be blind at least in our
community you have to be blind not to

94
00:05:53,050 --> 00:05:53,790
see this

95
00:05:53,790 --> 00:05:57,490
the sensors that are popping up at
virtually every facet of our lives and

96
00:05:57,490 --> 00:05:57,800
some

97
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:01,660
then we invite into our homes some them
are invited to tour

98
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:05,500
you know in our societies burnt or
communities for us if you've driven

99
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:07,280
across the George Washington Bridge

100
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:10,419
or any other such Lee checkpoints coming
in onto the island

101
00:06:10,419 --> 00:06:13,590
you're well aware solo what we did

102
00:06:13,590 --> 00:06:17,370
is taken you know I'm sending a pic the
counter measures by looking at what are

103
00:06:17,370 --> 00:06:20,210
the trends that may cause concern that
we need countermeasures in the first

104
00:06:20,210 --> 00:06:20,690
place

105
00:06:20,690 --> 00:06:24,580
well just as an example the government
India

106
00:06:24,580 --> 00:06:28,590
is the planning on tracking its
citizenry using a biometric

107
00:06:28,590 --> 00:06:30,120
identification system

108
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:33,660
on the order of 1.2 billion people and
kinda the first

109
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:37,840
generation this there's

110
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:41,870
research right now only think about
parts of your wives are currently 0 peak

111
00:06:41,870 --> 00:06:46,320
to various sensors are various people
who'd like to separate you from your

112
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:46,840
money

113
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:49,850
or to keep by your respective nations
save

114
00:06:49,850 --> 00:06:53,200
and examples you know review your living
room

115
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:56,310
very orwellian Arbor TVs and watch you

116
00:06:56,310 --> 00:06:59,720
are currently under under development in
the idea that they can tell people are

117
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:00,500
sitting in front

118
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:03,750
better targeted advertising and all
sorts of other

119
00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:07,660
potential uses in the same thing
communities in

120
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:10,979
in this is just an example that their
one group building a billion-dollar

121
00:07:10,979 --> 00:07:12,550
scientific ghost town

122
00:07:12,550 --> 00:07:15,979
to be sweet instrument the whole
community and you know largely these are

123
00:07:15,979 --> 00:07:16,479
for

124
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:21,389
business schemes not forward on the
surveillance society in the future

125
00:07:21,389 --> 00:07:25,940
but if it not good privacy is not built
in with proper

126
00:07:25,940 --> 00:07:29,080
safeguards them we risk doing just that

127
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:34,229
and then there's also applications what
do people do with these new data streams

128
00:07:34,229 --> 00:07:34,760
or

129
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:38,639
environments and I thought this is just
one example well if they can count

130
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:40,599
emperor penguins from space

131
00:07:40,599 --> 00:07:44,630
when also I can they do with that type
of technology in

132
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:48,080
in not just a one-off instance as we
sexy technology evolved

133
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:51,260
know this type of activity really could
occur in real time

134
00:07:51,260 --> 00:07:55,580
and we see other applications

135
00:07:55,580 --> 00:07:59,330
an often a trend for military technology
being used in

136
00:07:59,330 --> 00:08:03,630
say law enforcement or commercial use
and in this just example the police

137
00:08:03,630 --> 00:08:04,180
drone

138
00:08:04,180 --> 00:08:11,020
you know anything on the website very
Skynet like photo that flying over

139
00:08:11,020 --> 00:08:12,120
metropolis

140
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:17,110
and you there are technical challenges
and one of them being power

141
00:08:17,110 --> 00:08:20,830
we see research into better power for
these mobile

142
00:08:20,830 --> 00:08:26,770
worse fix sensor systems an example just
nuclear-powered redrawn research trying

143
00:08:26,770 --> 00:08:27,800
to go from D's

144
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:33,299
two months to on time on station lot of
investment behind it just

145
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:36,500
one example many many many examples

146
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:39,890
is minneapolis-saint Paul launching a
twenty million dollar

147
00:08:39,890 --> 00:08:44,530
HD surveillance cam camera project and
for those

148
00:08:44,530 --> 00:08:47,750
live in Manhattan your I think you're
well where are the surveillance has put

149
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:50,290
a system being put in place post-9/11

150
00:08:50,290 --> 00:08:55,120
in also increased capability another use

151
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:58,790
love the generator stator what do you do
with it how do you

152
00:08:58,790 --> 00:09:02,339
how can I be applied how can be mined in
the capability is getting better and

153
00:09:02,339 --> 00:09:02,940
better

154
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:07,230
now I to me a great example SoundHound
you hold that up because the sample the

155
00:09:07,230 --> 00:09:07,780
song

156
00:09:07,780 --> 00:09:11,770
and I can tell you what the song was and
if just had

157
00:09:11,770 --> 00:09:15,310
imagine how powerful that is and then
very it's what variance to that could be

158
00:09:15,310 --> 00:09:16,070
used for

159
00:09:16,070 --> 00:09:20,690
same thing official recognition
capabilities

160
00:09:20,690 --> 00:09:24,790
were really good idea identifying people
based on their physical appearance for

161
00:09:24,790 --> 00:09:25,699
other biometric

162
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:28,980
attributes trying to get to the unique
identity per person

163
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:32,140
and again getting much better active
area for research

164
00:09:32,140 --> 00:09:35,380
and when technology alone won't work

165
00:09:35,380 --> 00:09:39,380
we're seeing hybrid solutions that
happened what humans are good at and

166
00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:42,439
what machines are good at and this just
as an example

167
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:45,550
was a Google using capture to help

168
00:09:45,550 --> 00:09:52,240
humans decode street view addresses
sensors are getting better and better

169
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:56,470
on on a daily basis and just right now
in this basically terrifies me

170
00:09:56,470 --> 00:10:00,020
the idea sensor your real time video
through solid walls

171
00:10:00,020 --> 00:10:03,689
so your home's are you know dne aren't
necessarily secure

172
00:10:03,690 --> 00:10:07,319
I know it's not the best view on the
right hand side but it's there and it's

173
00:10:07,319 --> 00:10:08,640
a merging technology

174
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:14,280
behind much of this or incentives
incentives for government incentives for

175
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:16,240
businesses incentives for individuals

176
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:20,600
to employ and use these the sensor
systems

177
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:24,290
and just your people like their money

178
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:28,069
and you know this was just an example
that is GPS being used for driver

179
00:10:28,069 --> 00:10:29,189
discounts

180
00:10:29,190 --> 00:10:32,829
and may have seen various marketing for
free on that trying to commit to put

181
00:10:32,829 --> 00:10:33,920
these in their cars

182
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:37,040
in return for a discount

183
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:41,560
and then in general the justification
typically is to improve your

184
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:48,560
you know your online experience shopping
experience

185
00:10:49,930 --> 00:10:54,500
key component of this is tying into some
to some records from database

186
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:58,300
tells who you are because you have to
stay to you wanted Associated

187
00:10:58,300 --> 00:11:02,589
in with some person or group of people
and you see various

188
00:11:02,589 --> 00:11:06,810
the Thames coercive disclosure identity
and I think you can look at

189
00:11:06,810 --> 00:11:10,569
Google+ you know it first came out the
real-name policy trying to talk to real

190
00:11:10,569 --> 00:11:11,240
name

191
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:14,170
being just one example money so in this
case but the idea that you can't was

192
00:11:14,170 --> 00:11:15,370
people's arms

193
00:11:15,370 --> 00:11:19,560
and he that your billing records cell
phone numbers or idea that the other

194
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:20,060
means

195
00:11:20,060 --> 00:11:24,069
be able to hide those the that those
data flows

196
00:11:24,069 --> 00:11:28,430
at reason those data flows to people you
have you ever tried to get an anonymous

197
00:11:28,430 --> 00:11:30,520
EZ Pass if I know how

198
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:35,350
now difficult or essentially impossible
that is

199
00:11:35,350 --> 00:11:38,829
and what this picture a puppy is is so
if you go on the Google you're looking

200
00:11:38,829 --> 00:11:40,360
for vulnerability

201
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:43,930
this is this is the closest I could come
to you out upon our ability

202
00:11:43,930 --> 00:11:47,050
the soft underbelly above the suit
systems

203
00:11:47,050 --> 00:11:50,530
ok I try I try to be what is
vulnerability

204
00:11:50,530 --> 00:11:55,680
are so Google Images is beautiful for
things like that

205
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:59,020
but the systems themselves often

206
00:11:59,020 --> 00:12:02,510
partners linked to attack by third
parties and then they can get the people

207
00:12:02,510 --> 00:12:03,350
can get in

208
00:12:03,350 --> 00:12:06,560
am and use the systems that we're
building so this is a

209
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:11,160
legal uses illegal use and other
examples and Tom prosecute a great talk

210
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:12,800
and black hat DC

211
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:18,880
that explains some some the ways it
could be time

212
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:22,100
and then you see a lot of concerning
blue sky ideas

213
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:25,270
the for example the idea of using US
postal trucks

214
00:12:25,270 --> 00:12:29,000
as a fleet sensor platforms right you
think about that

215
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:32,880
driving peered community constant sensor
sensors in every

216
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:36,770
I censored you're monitoring the
community via the US Postal System

217
00:12:36,770 --> 00:12:42,890
so not this is being implemented by it
sure does make one nervous

218
00:12:42,890 --> 00:12:45,890
the end result of all this is the
potential for misuse

219
00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:49,890
is high we build it for arguably well
intentioned reasons

220
00:12:49,890 --> 00:12:54,030
but the potential for misuse either
through a slippery slope above

221
00:12:54,030 --> 00:12:57,060
you know which emit legal uses war

222
00:12:57,060 --> 00:13:01,569
heard were illegal use do for building
this infrastructure that could certainly

223
00:13:01,569 --> 00:13:05,610
abuse and in negative ways very very
negative words

224
00:13:05,610 --> 00:13:09,060
but will lower work and we're focused on
the physical world here

225
00:13:09,060 --> 00:13:13,060
world live online surveillance for
another talk

226
00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:16,300
these

227
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:19,850
so there is a Dr Chinese

228
00:13:19,850 --> 00:13:24,329
general name sons who who lived about
2500 years ago

229
00:13:24,329 --> 00:13:28,250
and what we're trying to to educate you
about on

230
00:13:28,250 --> 00:13:31,569
is actually has ancient roots on Sun
soon

231
00:13:31,569 --> 00:13:35,459
said many many things is his book is
often quoted they are 24

232
00:13:35,459 --> 00:13:38,640
but one of the things that he said was
if you know your enemy

233
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:42,390
and you know yourself than a hundred
panels you need not fear the outcome

234
00:13:42,390 --> 00:13:46,380
and dachau we're trying to get at here
we're gonna look at deconstructing a

235
00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:47,900
surveillance system

236
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:51,490
and Greg and I and some colleagues at
West Point have

237
00:13:51,490 --> 00:13:55,260
have developed a surveillance system
model and as I talk through the

238
00:13:55,260 --> 00:13:57,060
different component to the model

239
00:13:57,060 --> 00:14:01,010
think about what are the vulnerability
is what it was the soft underbelly

240
00:14:01,010 --> 00:14:04,050
over each of these components until its

241
00:14:04,050 --> 00:14:07,780
start out with the censors its a sensor
system it has sensors

242
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:11,660
we look at sensors in as an electrical
engineer

243
00:14:11,660 --> 00:14:15,290
inserted two broad categories sensors
can be passive

244
00:14:15,290 --> 00:14:19,429
Witcher what's down the bottom left
corner the receive energy

245
00:14:19,429 --> 00:14:23,319
from the environment and that's
fundamentally wanna sensor does is it

246
00:14:23,319 --> 00:14:27,010
it detects energy of some sort

247
00:14:27,010 --> 00:14:31,170
you could have an active sensors well
think other police radar gun

248
00:14:31,170 --> 00:14:34,329
active sensors omit some form of energy

249
00:14:34,329 --> 00:14:37,939
and then measure weren't returned

250
00:14:37,939 --> 00:14:41,390
all these sensors fundamentally measure

251
00:14:41,390 --> 00:14:45,230
analog quantities pressure

252
00:14:45,230 --> 00:14:48,260
lying he'd something like that on but

253
00:14:48,260 --> 00:14:52,850
all these computer systems that we work
with transmitted and stored digital

254
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:53,740
information

255
00:14:53,740 --> 00:14:57,459
so the sensors generally convert the
analog to digital

256
00:14:57,459 --> 00:15:01,799
and then there's usually a local
processing and local storage that's

257
00:15:01,799 --> 00:15:05,780
that's conducted two probes do feature
extraction identify

258
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:09,120
those on those identities perhaps our
the key

259
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:14,120
characteristics I and then often that
data is stored locally

260
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:17,170
what we're most concerned about are
these network

261
00:15:17,170 --> 00:15:20,209
surveillance systems or network sensor
systems

262
00:15:20,209 --> 00:15:24,770
because data that stored locally you
have to go there to hack it it's its

263
00:15:24,770 --> 00:15:28,459
it's more difficult to to compromise but
most

264
00:15:28,459 --> 00:15:31,770
many systems nowadays transmit data
across

265
00:15:31,770 --> 00:15:36,170
a network and I don't have to tell this
community happy how many vulnerabilities

266
00:15:36,170 --> 00:15:38,170
there are when you start doing that

267
00:15:38,170 --> 00:15:42,280
and the data is then aggregated and
stored perhaps in the cloud is stored

268
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:43,579
somewhere remotely

269
00:15:43,579 --> 00:15:47,579
and again that has all sorts of
vulnerabilities

270
00:15:47,579 --> 00:15:50,839
finally none of this would really be a
concern have never looked at it

271
00:15:50,839 --> 00:15:55,870
but were concerned about who has access
to this data

272
00:15:55,870 --> 00:15:59,339
who are the legitimate users and what
are they using it for

273
00:15:59,339 --> 00:16:03,150
and then of course as greg mentioned
these systems can be

274
00:16:03,150 --> 00:16:06,559
can be accessed by illegal third parties
and thats

275
00:16:06,559 --> 00:16:11,100
of course a concerned us um in addition
the systems don't have to action

276
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:15,610
miss only be accessed by real people one
sensor system can talk to another sensor

277
00:16:15,610 --> 00:16:16,370
system

278
00:16:16,370 --> 00:16:19,380
or two just another network computer
system

279
00:16:19,380 --> 00:16:23,630
think I've greg mentioned EZ Pass I I
love easy pass it makes

280
00:16:23,630 --> 00:16:27,510
Mike Gillis commute much easier I like
not having to stop

281
00:16:27,510 --> 00:16:30,809
every bridge toll and fork over well
known to buck 50

282
00:16:30,809 --> 00:16:34,000
arm why live upstate here's where
marjorie

283
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:38,299
yeah no idea his pace and outrageous fee
but yeah I have a cheaper commit

284
00:16:38,299 --> 00:16:41,900
so it's nice to be able to just drive
through the toll booth

285
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:46,419
but that EZ Pass system connects to you
the credit card system because every

286
00:16:46,419 --> 00:16:48,040
couple months the doc

287
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:52,939
25 or 35 bucks off my credit card so the
system's time to other systems and then

288
00:16:52,939 --> 00:16:54,500
you wonder about the secondary

289
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:57,530
security about other system so these are
all

290
00:16:57,530 --> 00:17:00,530
definitely areas of concern

291
00:17:00,530 --> 00:17:04,639
so now that we've we've known a little
bit about the the system as a whole

292
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:07,689
let's look and technologically based

293
00:17:07,689 --> 00:17:12,290
countermeasures so first off start we
started with looking at the sensor

294
00:17:12,290 --> 00:17:15,409
let's look at the center only bonus if
you gonna

295
00:17:15,410 --> 00:17:19,559
counter and two system you have to
understand what characteristics are

296
00:17:19,559 --> 00:17:23,240
Jo Brand has done some great talks on
hardware hacking

297
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:27,109
including one on DEFCON 17 and smart
parking meters

298
00:17:27,110 --> 00:17:30,980
if you know what the hardware consists
love you can figure out how to reverse

299
00:17:30,980 --> 00:17:31,740
engineer it

300
00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:34,809
and potentially on avoid

301
00:17:34,809 --> 00:17:38,139
being subject to it home

302
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:42,270
ultimately you would like to denied a
greater defeat the sensors

303
00:17:42,270 --> 00:17:46,030
first you have to know where they are so
this is a really clever

304
00:17:46,030 --> 00:17:49,450
car radar detector from a company in
Japan

305
00:17:49,450 --> 00:17:54,160
not sold in the US that I can find it
combines a GPS with the radar detector

306
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:59,690
on showed an and other online services
can be a great source for finding

307
00:17:59,690 --> 00:18:03,900
Sony's networked sensor systems if
they're visible online

308
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:08,150
you can use online tools to find them
and then then you know if your

309
00:18:08,150 --> 00:18:12,130
if and when you're being surveilled
sometimes

310
00:18:12,130 --> 00:18:15,549
the people who put the systems in the
place tell you about them

311
00:18:15,549 --> 00:18:19,570
Washington DC among some other local
governments tell you where the traffic

312
00:18:19,570 --> 00:18:22,330
cameras are these are designed to help
commuters

313
00:18:22,330 --> 00:18:26,129
so you can avoid rush hour rush hour
traffic jams

314
00:18:26,130 --> 00:18:29,530
sometimes community organizations band
together

315
00:18:29,530 --> 00:18:34,678
and develop on databases and where the
sensors are

316
00:18:34,679 --> 00:18:38,580
you have to understand where the sensors
are whether engines

317
00:18:38,580 --> 00:18:42,020
what they're covering and then
potentially might be just easy to bypass

318
00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:43,190
them

319
00:18:43,190 --> 00:18:47,740
home maybe with a little bit of work
maybe a maybe have to get any is doing

320
00:18:47,740 --> 00:18:51,570
arm but certainly if you can bypasses
sensor

321
00:18:51,570 --> 00:18:56,189
thats that easy countermeasure others if
you know the more technical than about

322
00:18:56,190 --> 00:18:57,160
the sensor

323
00:18:57,160 --> 00:19:00,220
if you know its sampling returned
sensitivity you can did

324
00:19:00,220 --> 00:19:04,710
defeated that way Mythbusters has done
some great episodes on this especially

325
00:19:04,710 --> 00:19:08,450
episode 59 the looked at a number

326
00:19:08,450 --> 00:19:12,630
sensor systems that were defeated in
movies and of course that know the Huron

327
00:19:12,630 --> 00:19:13,400
the movie

328
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:17,510
that blows a a little bit album powder
and you see this this network to rave

329
00:19:17,510 --> 00:19:19,360
lasers all around and they can

330
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:23,070
they can just step over instep under and
crawl around them

331
00:19:23,070 --> 00:19:27,289
if only it were that easy may the Boston
a number of things that were shown in

332
00:19:27,289 --> 00:19:27,850
the movies

333
00:19:27,850 --> 00:19:32,340
not everything in the movies is true I'm

334
00:19:32,340 --> 00:19:36,209
I'm but we we tested a couple use our
cells we have

335
00:19:36,210 --> 00:19:39,570
in are electro engineering program a

336
00:19:39,570 --> 00:19:44,928
flutie i 55 thermal imager and were able
to verify that yes indeed glass does

337
00:19:44,929 --> 00:19:45,539
block

338
00:19:45,539 --> 00:19:50,720
in for a on this is a a picture person
who's standing partly behind a glass

339
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:51,549
door

340
00:19:51,549 --> 00:19:56,309
and you can only see the party the
person that's not behind the glass door

341
00:19:56,309 --> 00:19:59,480
now granted that's maybe not the most
practical countermeasure walking around

342
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:01,570
New York City carrying a pena classism

343
00:20:01,570 --> 00:20:05,299
probably not recommend in arm went for a
lighter re

344
00:20:05,299 --> 00:20:08,840
more durable alternative try acrylic
plexiglass

345
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:13,129
works just as well much lighter doesn't
break you have no drop it

346
00:20:13,130 --> 00:20:16,340
however you might wanna put handles on
the backside

347
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:19,418
causes you're holding the plexiglas it
will heat up and then you can see

348
00:20:19,419 --> 00:20:21,990
through it again

349
00:20:21,990 --> 00:20:25,049
other types is electromagnetic your
other times ive

350
00:20:25,049 --> 00:20:29,910
energy that you might want to shield
against

351
00:20:29,910 --> 00:20:34,230
0 electromagnetic energy there's RFID
blocking wallets

352
00:20:34,230 --> 00:20:37,750
there's this really interesting product
to wifi shielding wallpaper that

353
00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:41,450
reagan I wanted to test it's not yet
available we sign on a

354
00:20:41,450 --> 00:20:45,840
on a website should be on I think this
fall the neat thing about it was it

355
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:51,049
alleges that it will block your WiFi
signals from getting high your house

356
00:20:51,049 --> 00:20:54,400
so people can snoop in and non use your

357
00:20:54,400 --> 00:21:00,039
use your WiFi network but it will allow
cell phone signals into your house

358
00:21:00,039 --> 00:21:03,840
which is an auto engineering I'm pretty
fascinating because

359
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:07,918
cell phone ban goes up to 1.9 gigahertz
and WiFi

360
00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:12,559
here to 11 BG and is it 2.4 gigahertz so

361
00:21:12,559 --> 00:21:16,168
how it can have that sharper filter I
think is pretty fascinating

362
00:21:16,169 --> 00:21:21,190
where maybe Maybin doesn't work so well
happy Easter

363
00:21:21,190 --> 00:21:24,660
by if you want to block visible light
you could you could do something like

364
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:28,220
put on these laptop copy Bunny Sox

365
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:32,380
it will prevent people from seeing what
you doing I wouldn't want help for those

366
00:21:32,380 --> 00:21:35,880
people that can detect your typing
simply by listening to you

367
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:41,100
on and it may actually attract some
attention

368
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:44,250
but it's a technique home and that
ultimately if

369
00:21:44,250 --> 00:21:47,530
if you're not connected to a network you
have to work on air gap

370
00:21:47,530 --> 00:21:50,860
if your computer only is connected to
your printer

371
00:21:50,860 --> 00:21:54,169
using a cable and it's in your house
then

372
00:21:54,169 --> 00:21:57,669
then you're protected to a much greater
extent

373
00:21:57,669 --> 00:22:02,600
hard to surf the internet that way but
sometimes these trade-offs

374
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:05,880
other forms shielding and sim

375
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:09,480
residents have Tempe Arizona had

376
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:13,549
in some issues with cameras that were
posted in their neighborhoods

377
00:22:13,549 --> 00:22:16,650
and so around christmastime Santa Claus
gave those present

378
00:22:16,650 --> 00:22:20,240
those those cameras present in

379
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:23,799
you may have heard in the news lately
stories about graphene

380
00:22:23,799 --> 00:22:26,850
making invisibility cloaks did not

381
00:22:26,850 --> 00:22:30,370
entirely science fiction there's
electromagnetic properties of graphene

382
00:22:30,370 --> 00:22:32,620
that will allow it to deflect

383
00:22:32,620 --> 00:22:36,470
electromagnetic radiation these are
still lab tests

384
00:22:36,470 --> 00:22:41,169
sorts of things but it could be coming
to you to a theater near you

385
00:22:41,169 --> 00:22:44,650
the military of course is interested in
these are two things

386
00:22:44,650 --> 00:22:48,169
the navy's interested in ultraviolet
cloaking

387
00:22:48,169 --> 00:22:52,370
we have a variety of systems and chaff
where you can

388
00:22:52,370 --> 00:22:56,049
disperse material to prevent radar from

389
00:22:56,049 --> 00:22:59,809
on to Broome your your visibility here
to rate or

390
00:22:59,809 --> 00:23:04,100
I'm and they're looking at being able to
do that in other specter

391
00:23:04,100 --> 00:23:07,429
or instead I've deflecting radiation

392
00:23:07,429 --> 00:23:11,080
maybe he just want to absorb that
radiation if best answer

393
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:15,549
doesn't detect the reflection then it
doesn't detect you

394
00:23:15,549 --> 00:23:18,750
so there are eight arms Irving materials
and potentially

395
00:23:18,750 --> 00:23:22,039
other types have absorbing materials
we're finally

396
00:23:22,039 --> 00:23:25,669
arm another opportunity would be to jam
that sensor

397
00:23:25,669 --> 00:23:29,330
send bank more energy than it's
expecting to receive

398
00:23:29,330 --> 00:23:32,870
its we live in just a cool world you can
search on the internet

399
00:23:32,870 --> 00:23:38,070
for green laser pointer webcam and yet
just dozens of cool pictures like this

400
00:23:38,070 --> 00:23:43,279
non-destructive at least you miss you
doing a liner close range

401
00:23:43,279 --> 00:23:46,899
or the really high power laser on but
its you know it's it certainly effective

402
00:23:46,899 --> 00:23:49,519
at blocking the image

403
00:23:49,519 --> 00:23:54,940
or you could try and destroy it with
much more intense radiation

404
00:23:54,940 --> 00:23:58,679
again nothing that you can find
searching the internet high-energy

405
00:23:58,679 --> 00:24:02,190
RF guns these however you want to care

406
00:24:02,190 --> 00:24:05,590
ok you can kill yourself happen

407
00:24:05,590 --> 00:24:09,309
these these are dangerous if you point
these it targets you really want to make

408
00:24:09,309 --> 00:24:12,059
sure that you own the target your point

409
00:24:12,059 --> 00:24:15,399
because you can you can do some serious
damage to

410
00:24:15,399 --> 00:24:19,029
people who work with mint lower te quise

411
00:24:19,029 --> 00:24:22,759
disabling might be something as simple
as when black people over lands

412
00:24:22,759 --> 00:24:27,379
war for disabling audio sensors
potentially a microphone plug

413
00:24:27,379 --> 00:24:30,549
that greg has is this cool picture the

414
00:24:30,549 --> 00:24:33,750
the microphone plug com it

415
00:24:33,750 --> 00:24:37,590
isn't something that he found but he
hasn't actually found a real source for

416
00:24:37,590 --> 00:24:41,689
anybody knows weakened by members cool
low-profile climbs

417
00:24:41,690 --> 00:24:46,289
please litmus now I'd like to buy couple
thousand of them

418
00:24:46,289 --> 00:24:51,120
and I mean I can go to Mauser digikey
and and

419
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:55,059
and get clothes but they're not they're
not that cool low-profile time

420
00:24:55,059 --> 00:24:58,350
so you refuse if you see one that is now

421
00:24:58,350 --> 00:25:03,210
arm soon

422
00:25:03,210 --> 00:25:06,779
so what we would get so far is largely
energy-based

423
00:25:06,779 --> 00:25:11,090
with the you know the energy being
omitted heavy block it disperses and so

424
00:25:11,090 --> 00:25:11,830
forth

425
00:25:11,830 --> 00:25:16,330
with the sectional look as little bit
higher level I had more than information

426
00:25:16,330 --> 00:25:16,840
model

427
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:22,889
and how denied to feed her degree that
in the process associated processing

428
00:25:22,889 --> 00:25:26,919
one come strategy is that it's proving
that you're generating something to me

429
00:25:26,919 --> 00:25:27,350
that

430
00:25:27,350 --> 00:25:30,700
books to be one thing that is actually
something else and

431
00:25:30,700 --> 00:25:34,220
there exist you interesting that you can
go back and look forward to operation

432
00:25:34,220 --> 00:25:35,360
bodyguard they had

433
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:39,230
mock-ups a very is viewed vehicles used
for Battlefield the section

434
00:25:39,230 --> 00:25:42,389
and then today you see circuit on the
2010

435
00:25:42,389 --> 00:25:46,500
Russian inflatable weapons but the idea
is

436
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:49,580
similarly camouflage circle World War
two

437
00:25:49,580 --> 00:25:53,070
doesn't camouflage used to in some cases

438
00:25:53,070 --> 00:25:56,999
Hyderabad are camouflaged being used to
hide a blend into the background

439
00:25:56,999 --> 00:26:01,039
but also to defeat being able to be
locked on her divert the I so when they

440
00:26:01,039 --> 00:26:02,970
gonna refuting a

441
00:26:02,970 --> 00:26:06,840
had a target they would be would divert
them away from the sensitive areas

442
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:11,659
doubt and then there's example dazzle
camouflage circa 1917

443
00:26:11,659 --> 00:26:16,399
in interestingly dazzle camouflage circa
2012

444
00:26:16,399 --> 00:26:19,460
I and its makeup and makeup

445
00:26:19,460 --> 00:26:23,769
you know techniques for defeating
several things one is

446
00:26:23,769 --> 00:26:27,070
daschle detection so it a

447
00:26:27,070 --> 00:26:31,249
the the computer algorithm can't
necessarily detected faces there

448
00:26:31,249 --> 00:26:34,980
effectively making you invisible to the
algorithm war

449
00:26:34,980 --> 00:26:38,320
defeating it defeating the

450
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:41,970
malcolm's ability to form facial
recognition and there's a great talk on

451
00:26:41,970 --> 00:26:45,659
on the right on the right hand side the
dazzle camouflage

452
00:26:45,659 --> 00:26:48,999
official recognition facts and fiction
and

453
00:26:48,999 --> 00:26:53,269
other from DEFCON 18:

454
00:26:53,269 --> 00:26:56,440
also the idea a degree in Information
quality in

455
00:26:56,440 --> 00:27:00,860
inserting spurious activity if Europe
and the Prisoner your college the it's

456
00:27:00,860 --> 00:27:01,509
your funeral

457
00:27:01,509 --> 00:27:04,799
episode where people would deliberately

458
00:27:04,799 --> 00:27:08,340
in certain ways you know tryin ads

459
00:27:08,340 --> 00:27:10,960
fool people into thinking they were
going to take some action which they

460
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:11,860
never did

461
00:27:11,860 --> 00:27:15,220
eventually lowering the threshold to the
point they the

462
00:27:15,220 --> 00:27:18,499
powers-that-be the serbia was not their
harm us

463
00:27:18,499 --> 00:27:21,679
and than they could strike

464
00:27:21,679 --> 00:27:25,730
and also to overcoming the processing
altogether absurdly powerful

465
00:27:25,730 --> 00:27:30,230
if you're looking at human base
processing

466
00:27:30,230 --> 00:27:34,070
and just I'm not advocating this but one
example Arab New York Times just earlier

467
00:27:34,070 --> 00:27:34,809
this year

468
00:27:34,809 --> 00:27:41,809
was the idea if you want to crash the
justice system just go to trial

469
00:27:43,100 --> 00:27:46,960
beyond the be high-level information
degradation type activities it's very

470
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:47,929
useful think it just

471
00:27:47,929 --> 00:27:51,110
collection intentions towards and wipes
p.m.

472
00:27:51,110 --> 00:27:54,269
of course there's encryption for data at
rest were delayed

473
00:27:54,269 --> 00:27:57,879
in transit but there's other activities
or other

474
00:27:57,879 --> 00:28:02,240
means to lower the a century billy club
data

475
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:05,590
for example you may have seen privacy
glass is that type of thing did

476
00:28:05,590 --> 00:28:08,830
only you can see what's on screen and

477
00:28:08,830 --> 00:28:11,439
to let me just say it's a great time to
be alive when they learned Austral

478
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:13,610
shredders that you can put a Volkswagen
bug

479
00:28:13,610 --> 00:28:17,570
into in trader should all be an
important part of our lives

480
00:28:17,570 --> 00:28:20,870
maybe not that big but

481
00:28:20,870 --> 00:28:24,809
there's also the idea because uRS and
the idea

482
00:28:24,809 --> 00:28:28,889
basically we need a plan to destroy our
data sometimes that's built into

483
00:28:28,889 --> 00:28:30,789
companies because the word about
discovery

484
00:28:30,789 --> 00:28:34,639
update on being able to get you get
pulled out into a court of law which

485
00:28:34,639 --> 00:28:39,080
maybe and senator a bit in general the
idea we need a plan for a stronger data

486
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:39,820
personally

487
00:28:39,820 --> 00:28:43,200
and in the people we deal with

488
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:46,559
in avoiding generating data in the first
place I'm

489
00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:50,600
sometimes we have a choice sometimes we
don't

490
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:53,460
we need to use a common sense to make
sure that when we have a choice we're

491
00:28:53,460 --> 00:28:54,049
not doing

492
00:28:54,049 --> 00:28:57,529
disclosing something that we should and
I was up for less rather than more

493
00:28:57,529 --> 00:29:01,100
however are becoming a Leo Leone low
tides

494
00:29:01,100 --> 00:29:05,049
and attempting to live in the 21st
century I can be very difficult

495
00:29:05,049 --> 00:29:08,429
thing I I'd like to live in the 21st
century don't want to live in a cabin in

496
00:29:08,429 --> 00:29:09,289
montana

497
00:29:09,289 --> 00:29:14,309
but you I think there are times in our
lives we have a choice

498
00:29:14,309 --> 00:29:19,210
or companies have a try sometimes their
governments have a choice

499
00:29:19,210 --> 00:29:22,389
sensors themselves apart up sensor
systems you often

500
00:29:22,389 --> 00:29:25,559
with command control

501
00:29:25,559 --> 00:29:29,539
there are opportunities good and bad for
sensors to be controlled

502
00:29:29,539 --> 00:29:33,529
this is an example love the ability to
turn off cameras

503
00:29:33,529 --> 00:29:38,240
I was packed boat remote cameras by
sending certain signal to the camera

504
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:42,639
personally I find that concerning the by
certain entities could turn off my

505
00:29:42,639 --> 00:29:44,090
camera against my will

506
00:29:44,090 --> 00:29:49,690
but nonetheless there are perhaps
mechanisms for controlling the sensors

507
00:29:49,690 --> 00:29:52,869
but in there also I mean using the
online example we

508
00:29:52,869 --> 00:29:55,940
have the police control use and privacy
settings how much

509
00:29:55,940 --> 00:30:00,749
information we share to the public and
tubers group

510
00:30:00,749 --> 00:30:04,200
however and oftentimes that

511
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:07,470
you've seen that it wasn't your Facebook
there's a constant sirs articles how

512
00:30:07,470 --> 00:30:08,409
their

513
00:30:08,409 --> 00:30:12,389
privacy settings which shall we say
artwork all that intuitive

514
00:30:12,389 --> 00:30:17,009
and we're set with the faults that were
all there be protected from privacy

515
00:30:17,009 --> 00:30:20,610
I'm but beyond that be weird delusion up
control

516
00:30:20,610 --> 00:30:24,740
so you can set your privacy settings all
day for who you share information with

517
00:30:24,740 --> 00:30:26,389
under social networking site

518
00:30:26,389 --> 00:30:29,499
but you should not forget that Homer
data

519
00:30:29,499 --> 00:30:33,899
every conceivably spinner actually
likely resides forever

520
00:30:33,899 --> 00:30:37,830
on the servers up the company that
you're dealing with so but beware the

521
00:30:37,830 --> 00:30:40,499
illusion of control

522
00:30:40,499 --> 00:30:43,669
people see bob also

523
00:30:43,669 --> 00:30:46,889
denial of service and I i think now
service particularly interesting when

524
00:30:46,889 --> 00:30:48,070
you look at the human

525
00:30:48,070 --> 00:30:51,330
in the communications channel aspects

526
00:30:51,330 --> 00:30:54,850
period since systems and I thought this
was a great example

527
00:30:54,850 --> 00:30:58,509
are good but whites if I could see you I
would say

528
00:30:58,509 --> 00:31:02,450
with the show him who's received robo
calls that they haven't that into their

529
00:31:02,450 --> 00:31:03,360
lives that they haven't

530
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:06,470
okay I can see him I could see a test
I'm

531
00:31:06,470 --> 00:31:10,799
so one enterprising company decided to
build a reverse robo call our

532
00:31:10,799 --> 00:31:13,980
so let's say a given government leader

533
00:31:13,980 --> 00:31:17,100
decided to call you invite you to vote
for him or her in their campaign

534
00:31:17,100 --> 00:31:21,990
this company would allow you to dial
that person back repeatedly

535
00:31:21,990 --> 00:31:25,480
expressing your personal interest it not
being on there

536
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:28,619
on their list anymore are it no

537
00:31:28,619 --> 00:31:32,259
I went back later in the company's is
now not offering the service

538
00:31:32,259 --> 00:31:37,929
I'm not sure exactly what happened but I
thought it was a great track

539
00:31:37,929 --> 00:31:41,669
and then be on the nightly so good get
into this larger context minute

540
00:31:41,669 --> 00:31:45,899
but was so we've talked about the the
censor themselves energy flowing

541
00:31:45,899 --> 00:31:49,980
than information but we also need to
understand actors because really they're

542
00:31:49,980 --> 00:31:51,240
the people building

543
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:54,669
sharing allowing these things to take
place

544
00:31:54,669 --> 00:32:00,169
so with that altruism

545
00:32:00,169 --> 00:32:03,570
so the monoline I talked about a little
bit ago

546
00:32:03,570 --> 00:32:06,840
is is a technologically focused mono and

547
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:11,440
and that's important because thats
that's who we is technologist my own

548
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:15,090
to to tinker and we have the expertise
to to exploit

549
00:32:15,090 --> 00:32:18,460
but even more important is

550
00:32:18,460 --> 00:32:22,269
the ability d to understand how that
model

551
00:32:22,269 --> 00:32:26,799
fits into the real world because
technological solutions

552
00:32:26,799 --> 00:32:32,499
aren't always the the most permanent if
you can get a system removed entirely

553
00:32:32,499 --> 00:32:35,590
then then that's better than having
defeated

554
00:32:35,590 --> 00:32:40,009
honor an angel sent to prison term basis
so let's look at the world that these

555
00:32:40,009 --> 00:32:43,749
that the sensor systems resign in for
star

556
00:32:43,749 --> 00:32:48,330
the sensors have targets and often
that's that's us

557
00:32:48,330 --> 00:32:52,389
and and as users and as citizens we
should be concerned

558
00:32:52,389 --> 00:32:56,369
and understand what these with the
systems are and then think about

559
00:32:56,369 --> 00:32:59,919
how we how we want to interact with them
we're

560
00:32:59,919 --> 00:33:03,759
or perhaps not interact with them at all
I'm all these systems

561
00:33:03,759 --> 00:33:07,769
or in place for a purpose who uses the
data

562
00:33:07,769 --> 00:33:11,169
who has legal and says who is illegal
access

563
00:33:11,169 --> 00:33:14,220
what are they using the data for and

564
00:33:14,220 --> 00:33:17,429
can we strike a compromise with them
that they can get

565
00:33:17,429 --> 00:33:20,429
some or most to the benefit in that
system

566
00:33:20,429 --> 00:33:25,019
with down unduly affecting our privacy

567
00:33:25,019 --> 00:33:28,320
all the systems have enablers and by
that we mean

568
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:31,668
corporations companies individuals that

569
00:33:31,669 --> 00:33:35,080
the design-build more kid these systems

570
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:38,210
they have a financial incentive in these
systems

571
00:33:38,210 --> 00:33:43,259
but can they also be persuaded to build
in security building in privacy

572
00:33:43,259 --> 00:33:46,700
so that their system is still profitable
them

573
00:33:46,700 --> 00:33:49,960
but nyse: owners to us

574
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:53,419
and then all of the systems that are in
place are in place by

575
00:33:53,419 --> 00:33:57,110
some organizations some collection of
people BNA

576
00:33:57,110 --> 00:34:00,690
a company were a government or

577
00:34:00,690 --> 00:34:04,600
no whether to local municipality or a
national government

578
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:09,540
and the whose owners have a vested
interest in getting some benefit from

579
00:34:09,540 --> 00:34:10,418
the system's

580
00:34:10,418 --> 00:34:13,790
but again perhaps there could be a
compromise struck

581
00:34:13,790 --> 00:34:17,230
that they still retain some poster all
the benefit

582
00:34:17,230 --> 00:34:20,530
without being detrimental to our way of
life

583
00:34:20,530 --> 00:34:23,690
on and then finally already in the
system regulated

584
00:34:23,690 --> 00:34:27,110
should they be regulated can they be
regulated who might best

585
00:34:27,110 --> 00:34:30,320
regulate them so that we can

586
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:33,669
continue the way of life that we enjoy
without

587
00:34:33,668 --> 00:34:37,009
arm without suffering the harm thats

588
00:34:37,010 --> 00:34:40,399
the second-order effects from so many
systems so

589
00:34:40,399 --> 00:34:43,489
or though we as technologist

590
00:34:43,490 --> 00:34:47,470
always tend to turn first words a a
technological solution

591
00:34:47,470 --> 00:34:50,690
its is often most effective to

592
00:34:50,690 --> 00:34:53,929
to look at this broader context so
influencing

593
00:34:53,929 --> 00:34:57,400
the policy in policymakers can be a very
powerful way

594
00:34:57,400 --> 00:35:00,570
counteracting systems on and in

595
00:35:00,570 --> 00:35:04,350
in many countries in the world including
this one we can do that through the

596
00:35:04,350 --> 00:35:05,170
ballot box

597
00:35:05,170 --> 00:35:09,530
and I encourage all a beauty to use your
right to vote

598
00:35:09,530 --> 00:35:12,930
in a way then I'm that

599
00:35:12,930 --> 00:35:16,649
you know did exercise your right to vote

600
00:35:16,650 --> 00:35:22,140
we also as as technologist have a unique
ability to educate

601
00:35:22,140 --> 00:35:25,150
educator friends educator neighbors in
our communities

602
00:35:25,150 --> 00:35:29,350
about the system's but then also educate
the decision-makers

603
00:35:29,350 --> 00:35:34,190
and if if we want to influence policy
and we wanna have laws

604
00:35:34,190 --> 00:35:39,350
that protect privacy the policy makers
need to understand the issues

605
00:35:39,350 --> 00:35:42,970
perhaps on the best ways to educate is
through the mass media

606
00:35:42,970 --> 00:35:47,390
and so Stephen cans given in excellent
are on how to talk to the mainstream

607
00:35:47,390 --> 00:35:48,440
media

608
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:51,490
to the or voices become heard

609
00:35:51,490 --> 00:35:55,700
more broadly I'm and and we can learn
from history

610
00:35:55,700 --> 00:35:59,390
visited other my students sometimes
think that the the only important

611
00:35:59,390 --> 00:36:02,339
inventions incurred in the last five
years

612
00:36:02,340 --> 00:36:06,580
that's not always the case look to
history and learn from it

613
00:36:06,580 --> 00:36:09,770
mass media can be influenced on

614
00:36:09,770 --> 00:36:14,509
this research a really cool billboard
that we found you can educate people

615
00:36:14,510 --> 00:36:17,869
in in some way unobtrusive ways and
again

616
00:36:17,869 --> 00:36:20,930
if if it's just one or two people
speaking out

617
00:36:20,930 --> 00:36:24,600
nobody hears you but if you really
support in get

618
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:28,100
thousands tens of thousands hundreds of
thousands on your side

619
00:36:28,100 --> 00:36:32,368
you can make main impact we all remember
what happened in January when

620
00:36:32,369 --> 00:36:36,570
when Wikipedia and major online
companies

621
00:36:36,570 --> 00:36:40,500
work on the Internet yeah I'm and add
that when your parents

622
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:46,730
our grandparents are asking about what's
open is we've succeeded

623
00:36:46,730 --> 00:36:50,940
yes I'm and even on a local scale

624
00:36:50,940 --> 00:36:55,510
the state of pennsylvania ran and for
tax amnesty that had

625
00:36:55,510 --> 00:36:59,270
these were really implications and it
was used way over the top

626
00:36:59,270 --> 00:37:02,570
on when and say things like

627
00:37:02,570 --> 00:37:05,670
was in time we can make this easy in a
satellite video

628
00:37:05,670 --> 00:37:08,790
on his zooming in on a picture about
house

629
00:37:08,790 --> 00:37:13,090
and presumably in pennsylvania my he to
be the person actually own that house

630
00:37:13,090 --> 00:37:16,600
when I feel paranoid om so

631
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:19,910
so this was an and that was that was
just kind of egregious

632
00:37:19,910 --> 00:37:25,830
and the local community protested
recently we went back to the site we saw

633
00:37:25,830 --> 00:37:26,880
that video

634
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:30,270
and and it wasn't there cell

635
00:37:30,270 --> 00:37:34,859
sometimes sometimes you can effect
change

636
00:37:34,859 --> 00:37:37,940
they even took the head on

637
00:37:37,940 --> 00:37:42,470
URL and some under enterprising up

638
00:37:42,470 --> 00:37:46,540
enterprising entrepreneur repurposed it
for his a his or her own benefit

639
00:37:46,540 --> 00:37:50,930
I'm but it's important to communicate
these issues effectively

640
00:37:50,930 --> 00:37:54,819
when you speak to you be felon
technologist

641
00:37:54,820 --> 00:37:58,940
you might speak differently than you do
to the mass media or than you do to

642
00:37:58,940 --> 00:38:00,040
decision-makers

643
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:03,230
into you have to communicate these
issues effectively

644
00:38:03,230 --> 00:38:08,000
on Daniel solove had very powerful
example talking about privacy and

645
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:11,080
and just how sticky a concept that is

646
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:14,600
when those things that we we know when
we see it but how do we actually define

647
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:19,670
talk about it art can be a powerful we
communicate

648
00:38:19,670 --> 00:38:24,410
and and again sometimes sometimes that
works

649
00:38:24,410 --> 00:38:29,509
science fiction is well-known were
communicating in raising issues and

650
00:38:29,510 --> 00:38:32,840
I've technological problems long before
they

651
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:36,750
they actually are instantiated you

652
00:38:36,750 --> 00:38:41,000
can often be affected if you highlight
cost-benefit analyses

653
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:45,770
on the TSA has drawn much attention for

654
00:38:45,770 --> 00:38:49,020
for ways that its surveilled us on

655
00:38:49,020 --> 00:38:53,220
and in sometimes in very harmful way is
and as you draw attention

656
00:38:53,220 --> 00:38:57,020
to you health risks were costs

657
00:38:57,020 --> 00:39:00,420
the effectiveness the user's and the
owners are these systems

658
00:39:00,420 --> 00:39:03,780
are continually doing a cost-benefit
analysis if the cost is too high

659
00:39:03,780 --> 00:39:05,450
compared to the benefit

660
00:39:05,450 --> 00:39:10,720
they can be persuaded to change change
the reference

661
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:13,940
so I'm when

662
00:39:13,940 --> 00:39:18,609
when TSA breaks someone's ten thousand
dollar insulin pump

663
00:39:18,609 --> 00:39:22,940
that's a serious problem yes there's a
legitimate security interests

664
00:39:22,940 --> 00:39:29,030
fun not when its comes at the cost is
I'm actually harming the citizens

665
00:39:29,030 --> 00:39:32,390
so you can you can effect change

666
00:39:32,390 --> 00:39:36,310
transparency we believe is always a good
thing disclosure

667
00:39:36,310 --> 00:39:40,950
love where the sensors are and what
they're doing is is important

668
00:39:40,950 --> 00:39:45,670
sometimes it can be embarrassing not
everybody who uses sensor systems

669
00:39:45,670 --> 00:39:50,580
uses them for beneficial purposes but
transparency does help keep people

670
00:39:50,580 --> 00:39:52,290
honest

671
00:39:52,290 --> 00:39:56,560
and as researchers we advocate
conducting in sharing

672
00:39:56,560 --> 00:40:01,110
admissible research admissible meaning
invisible in the legal context if

673
00:40:01,110 --> 00:40:05,040
if research is done well he can be
introduced in some manners

674
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:08,100
this court case is that going to lead to
earlier

675
00:40:08,100 --> 00:40:12,150
we can influence laws in policy makers
to the court system

676
00:40:12,150 --> 00:40:17,530
if if we do our research well

677
00:40:17,530 --> 00:40:23,520
and you can on take these issues to
congress maybe not you personally

678
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:28,840
but people organizations can be called
to testify in front of Congress

679
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:32,800
and other we give congress sometimes a
hard time for

680
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:37,140
for some laws are the things they do or
don't do here's an example

681
00:40:37,140 --> 00:40:41,310
love are a congressional panel doing PSA
oversight

682
00:40:41,310 --> 00:40:45,080
and when Cubs when your congressional
report it says the work hard two

683
00:40:45,080 --> 00:40:45,830
committees

684
00:40:45,830 --> 00:40:50,890
has documented a recurring pattern
mismanagement ways to the TSA

685
00:40:50,890 --> 00:40:55,020
and listen unending string and video
clips photographs and news reports about

686
00:40:55,020 --> 00:40:59,860
inappropriate clumsy and even all
logical surges in screenings by TSA

687
00:40:59,860 --> 00:41:00,700
agents

688
00:41:00,700 --> 00:41:04,020
innocent but some pretty damning
commentary about

689
00:41:04,020 --> 00:41:07,650
in other branch of government so
sometimes congress does get

690
00:41:07,650 --> 00:41:11,290
and we do have multiple branches of
government

691
00:41:11,290 --> 00:41:14,870
you can work through the legislative
arena possibly through the judicial

692
00:41:14,870 --> 00:41:15,640
arena

693
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:19,440
we've I think probably all heard about
the the reason brown case on

694
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:24,610
GPS on and even the white house has
taken notice with their

695
00:41:24,610 --> 00:41:28,660
prime see below blind right it's just
been

696
00:41:28,660 --> 00:41:31,740
been drawn up so

697
00:41:31,740 --> 00:41:34,920
is anyone here a citizen I've seen em

698
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:38,310
obscene and the city but I can see but I

699
00:41:38,310 --> 00:41:42,440
if there are but bid in number they were
advocating these more extreme measures

700
00:41:42,440 --> 00:41:46,880
but for cock to big comprehensive inner
now something certainly people used over

701
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:47,900
the server

702
00:41:47,900 --> 00:41:51,650
centuries the idea of non-violent civil
disobedience

703
00:41:51,650 --> 00:41:55,550
some people started their own countries
I certainly hacktivism people start on

704
00:41:55,550 --> 00:41:56,850
political parties

705
00:41:56,850 --> 00:42:00,920
and in there's been and other ways
populism form folks that they weren't

706
00:42:00,920 --> 00:42:01,890
they were displeased

707
00:42:01,890 --> 00:42:06,730
so there are other merch three measures
of course we're not advocating them

708
00:42:06,730 --> 00:42:10,540
for for less extreme Andrews you can do
things like support your primes the

709
00:42:10,540 --> 00:42:12,009
champion's choice

710
00:42:12,010 --> 00:42:15,100
on things like the the Electronic
Frontier Foundation which has many

711
00:42:15,100 --> 00:42:15,880
speakers here

712
00:42:15,880 --> 00:42:19,790
at this conference were you can join a
professional societies such as the the

713
00:42:19,790 --> 00:42:21,529
IEEE the ACM

714
00:42:21,530 --> 00:42:26,280
that also help communicate to the media
and advocate to you

715
00:42:26,280 --> 00:42:29,320
to our legislature bodies on

716
00:42:29,320 --> 00:42:33,360
but as always common sense should
prevail

717
00:42:33,360 --> 00:42:37,530
along little bit of common sense can go
a long way towards

718
00:42:37,530 --> 00:42:40,540
counteracting some unease measures but
also

719
00:42:40,540 --> 00:42:43,920
arm common sense just in your in your
daily lives and

720
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:49,300
and common sense in how you go about
employing some these countermeasures

721
00:42:49,300 --> 00:42:56,300
Greg

722
00:42:57,220 --> 00:42:59,630
so some parting thoughts to to wrap this
up

723
00:42:59,630 --> 00:43:04,760
this is a I was looking for picture an
expert urban and mood

724
00:43:04,760 --> 00:43:08,820
I'm bud I'm best I could find was a good
picture above

725
00:43:08,820 --> 00:43:12,370
a finance but the idea is when you're
dealing with governments you have to

726
00:43:12,370 --> 00:43:13,940
expect lumbering bureaucracy

727
00:43:13,940 --> 00:43:18,070
and and find ways either to hack the
system by finding the appropriate people

728
00:43:18,070 --> 00:43:18,860
that will

729
00:43:18,860 --> 00:43:22,650
help you or understand the process easy
you can use the most effective way

730
00:43:22,650 --> 00:43:26,050
but don't be surprised if you run into
bureaucracy you're trying to import

731
00:43:26,050 --> 00:43:26,660
sperms

732
00:43:26,660 --> 00:43:31,279
and also is as much as we like to be
smart dogs

733
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:34,310
myself included about to use and
countermeasures

734
00:43:34,310 --> 00:43:40,070
beware counter countermeasures and and
this is a picture of someone who was

735
00:43:40,070 --> 00:43:44,400
be videotaping police as they shot up a
car in Miami

736
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:48,090
I'm and I don't know the details are you
know how that panned out I do know that

737
00:43:48,090 --> 00:43:49,570
there's a video on youtube

738
00:43:49,570 --> 00:43:54,070
above the individual at gunpoint where
the police officers expressing

739
00:43:54,070 --> 00:43:54,710
displeasure

740
00:43:54,710 --> 00:43:57,960
about being videotaped I'm it's very
compelling

741
00:43:57,960 --> 00:44:01,160
and when he will release the slides if
you get a chance to see this

742
00:44:01,160 --> 00:44:06,109
a highly recommended and don't be put
off by naysayers

743
00:44:06,110 --> 00:44:09,110
I'm not those you America academia works

744
00:44:09,110 --> 00:44:13,550
you submit a paper to a conference you
get reviews back from various people

745
00:44:13,550 --> 00:44:16,690
and they give you great in a few the
great time of you getting

746
00:44:16,690 --> 00:44:21,450
arm so reason I were writing a paper on
gonna subject very close to this

747
00:44:21,450 --> 00:44:24,780
where I may have mentioned something
about I'm

748
00:44:24,780 --> 00:44:28,290
had total Information Awareness being a
bad thing

749
00:44:28,290 --> 00:44:33,120
and and I I i think i touched a nerve
one of the reviewers

750
00:44:33,120 --> 00:44:38,100
and the be sleep before making baseless
assessments implications

751
00:44:38,100 --> 00:44:42,050
and was one of the quotes and it sounds
more like a political manifesto so I may

752
00:44:42,050 --> 00:44:43,320
have gone a little too far

753
00:44:43,320 --> 00:44:47,570
but nonetheless we were put off by this
right we okay we took the feedback

754
00:44:47,570 --> 00:44:51,080
I touched a nerve and got into an even
better conference

755
00:44:51,080 --> 00:44:54,640
about a month later so you just can't be
put off by naysayers

756
00:44:54,640 --> 00:44:58,180
you found us with privacy and security
be

757
00:44:58,180 --> 00:45:02,089
yes ultimate writer thank you

758
00:45:02,090 --> 00:45:05,840
ok okay

759
00:45:05,840 --> 00:45:10,310
were one up so we should be good serb

760
00:45:10,310 --> 00:45:13,610
but edge as you trying to do the things
you find that you can

761
00:45:13,610 --> 00:45:16,880
take you can teach people about privacy
is important for privacy

762
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:21,500
terrible me a given rate and the others
less so far you can take people down the

763
00:45:21,500 --> 00:45:22,160
rabbit hole

764
00:45:22,160 --> 00:45:25,500
first wash so just beware don't be put
off by

765
00:45:25,500 --> 00:45:28,500
naysayers his

766
00:45:28,500 --> 00:45:32,050
I'm not the one seen thus far it's what
Slashdot a while back

767
00:45:32,050 --> 00:45:36,050
but it's a beautiful thing it was a fire
talking about communities against

768
00:45:36,050 --> 00:45:36,840
terrorism

769
00:45:36,840 --> 00:45:40,910
potential indicators are terrorist
activities related to internet cafes

770
00:45:40,910 --> 00:45:44,330
and the suspicious activities which I
precluded

771
00:45:44,330 --> 00:45:47,299
proposes be great countermeasures and
things we should be doing just to

772
00:45:47,300 --> 00:45:48,660
protect our own privacy

773
00:45:48,660 --> 00:45:52,180
on included overly concerned about
privacy

774
00:45:52,180 --> 00:45:56,879
always paying in cash using anonymizer
to shield IP address

775
00:45:56,880 --> 00:46:00,520
using encryption and finally downloading
information

776
00:46:00,520 --> 00:46:05,440
about electronics bud

777
00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:08,790
so actually I was gonna hand out these
flyers today but I thought I'd be going

778
00:46:08,790 --> 00:46:12,529
perhaps a little too far and ideas we
need to inform

779
00:46:12,530 --> 00:46:15,640
folks there well often well-intentioned
overworked

780
00:46:15,640 --> 00:46:19,520
and in a and I'm to be fair I pulled out
these because they're

781
00:46:19,520 --> 00:46:22,750
but there are others in their their
arguably our a good thing

782
00:46:22,750 --> 00:46:26,760
but we need to inform folks so that it
will get better

783
00:46:26,760 --> 00:46:31,380
better results from leaders also

784
00:46:31,380 --> 00:46:36,370
seek actionable changes don't you know
trying to her cancer overnight

785
00:46:36,370 --> 00:46:40,100
i think im we know what can be done what
can you go to a decision maker with the

786
00:46:40,100 --> 00:46:41,950
actually can have the power to do

787
00:46:41,950 --> 00:46:45,630
it may be still compasses the in-state
with maybe less

788
00:46:45,630 --> 00:46:49,530
issues regarding privacy in a few on the
left have you seen the

789
00:46:49,530 --> 00:46:54,300
initial obscure a TSA scanners 0 the
Riviere invasive showing sensual any

790
00:46:54,300 --> 00:46:55,180
good people

791
00:46:55,180 --> 00:46:58,240
causing an uproar and incremental

792
00:46:58,240 --> 00:47:03,060
positive change perhaps is the idea if
you have this more cartoonish person

793
00:47:03,060 --> 00:47:03,710
that doesn't

794
00:47:03,710 --> 00:47:06,950
that still compasses the objective
without naked pictures

795
00:47:06,950 --> 00:47:10,290
under shopping store dinner government
database summer

796
00:47:10,290 --> 00:47:14,180
and as you employ countermeasures beware
the risk

797
00:47:14,180 --> 00:47:18,069
love uniqueness make yourself more
unique because you're employing the

798
00:47:18,070 --> 00:47:18,940
countermeasure

799
00:47:18,940 --> 00:47:23,890
in some way am the affected a really
project coping of the clicking what you

800
00:47:23,890 --> 00:47:25,680
did is you visit with the browser

801
00:47:25,680 --> 00:47:30,089
and based on information browser past
the server through mobile interactions

802
00:47:30,090 --> 00:47:35,830
they were able to uniquely identified
millions and millions are browsers

803
00:47:35,830 --> 00:47:40,020
in there's a really wonderful talk on
Def Con at Def Con that came out after

804
00:47:40,020 --> 00:47:40,600
this

805
00:47:40,600 --> 00:47:43,770
but just idea here's be where is your
employees countermeasures that you're

806
00:47:43,770 --> 00:47:45,940
making yourself more unique and more

807
00:47:45,940 --> 00:47:50,470
perhaps a target so in conclusion

808
00:47:50,470 --> 00:47:54,030
I really believe is a look and see

809
00:47:54,030 --> 00:47:57,140
everywhere once you're tuned into this
everywhere you look you'll see more and

810
00:47:57,140 --> 00:47:59,750
more sensors in our lives will see more
and more

811
00:47:59,750 --> 00:48:03,000
information flows aggregating this data

812
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:06,260
more and more use in a minimum

813
00:48:06,260 --> 00:48:09,580
we'd should beware us and sensitive to
this

814
00:48:09,580 --> 00:48:13,350
and we should Canon we should protect
ourselves but in particular the

815
00:48:13,350 --> 00:48:14,720
community this community like

816
00:48:14,720 --> 00:48:17,980
we have here in the audience today you
got special powers

817
00:48:17,980 --> 00:48:21,950
special skills that are that are and
special insights

818
00:48:21,950 --> 00:48:25,270
that allow you to you to understand
what's going on

819
00:48:25,270 --> 00:48:30,180
and help inform and shape the debates on
going now through technology and policy

820
00:48:30,180 --> 00:48:33,430
and we can deflect the trajectory of the
servile

821
00:48:33,430 --> 00:48:37,240
future because gonna have to live with
otherwise

822
00:48:37,240 --> 00:48:40,340
so for more information we'll have this
on slide that we share for the whole

823
00:48:40,340 --> 00:48:41,650
body psych

824
00:48:41,650 --> 00:48:46,120
we do this and I'm and some colleagues
have done some work in the space

825
00:48:46,120 --> 00:48:49,830
including some on automated law
enforcement because if you think about

826
00:48:49,830 --> 00:48:50,930
the surveillance future

827
00:48:50,930 --> 00:48:56,220
a natural extension that is who will
help to enforce the laws better that way

828
00:48:56,220 --> 00:48:59,300
so everyone we driving 55 on the

829
00:48:59,300 --> 00:49:03,110
on the beltway around DC

830
00:49:03,110 --> 00:49:07,260
so with that are there any questions

831
00:49:07,260 --> 00:49:10,800
on my

832
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:15,690
him yes I won't let me let me ask that
there is a microphone here

833
00:49:15,690 --> 00:49:19,440
that's the preferred method I'm
otherwise that we have to remember Peter

834
00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:20,120
questions

835
00:49:20,120 --> 00:49:23,279
Cup programs

836
00:49:23,280 --> 00:49:26,340
and Christian up so often

837
00:49:26,340 --> 00:49:30,230
opener the other the other bus line

838
00:49:30,230 --> 00:49:33,240
do can yes go ahead please

839
00:49:33,240 --> 00:49:36,880
do any thoughts on the proliferation by
magic cameras such as the makers of

840
00:49:36,880 --> 00:49:37,880
connect

841
00:49:37,880 --> 00:49:41,310
I'm primeSense I'm

842
00:49:41,310 --> 00:49:44,350
mean know comes at two sons was getting
better right

843
00:49:44,350 --> 00:49:48,710
and we're inviting them into our homes
and we're collecting data with them

844
00:49:48,710 --> 00:49:52,120
and then it comes down to the controls
up to date as the d-league team

845
00:49:52,120 --> 00:49:56,660
is a being shared in is it even if it's
not being shared freely with the company

846
00:49:56,660 --> 00:49:58,600
that did not aware of

847
00:49:58,600 --> 00:50:02,480
is it being is doesn't reside such that
a corner other

848
00:50:02,480 --> 00:50:06,930
you could come in handy in access to it
words that system secure so

849
00:50:06,930 --> 00:50:10,770
me I think in general it in us you know
that's just one of many sensors were

850
00:50:10,770 --> 00:50:12,350
invited into our lives

851
00:50:12,350 --> 00:50:15,069
and those are the questions you ask
where's the deal is being shared

852
00:50:15,070 --> 00:50:15,930
immediately

853
00:50:15,930 --> 00:50:19,259
is the system secure in could be does
reside

854
00:50:19,260 --> 00:50:23,110
in my system such that saw a third party
together perhaps a remark or

855
00:50:23,110 --> 00:50:27,150
so to the network nature this most
insane yeah I mean if its network

856
00:50:27,150 --> 00:50:30,220
arian its even more of an issue right

857
00:50:30,220 --> 00:50:33,380
thank you sure yes

858
00:50:33,380 --> 00:50:37,070
I don't know I have a question on I'm
from Philadelphia and in Philly we have

859
00:50:37,070 --> 00:50:37,440
a a

860
00:50:37,440 --> 00:50:40,590
a volunteer I have a camera program
where

861
00:50:40,590 --> 00:50:44,490
your private webcam has plenty on the
street let the police know on any

862
00:50:44,490 --> 00:50:47,850
basically register you have you looked
into

863
00:50:47,850 --> 00:50:52,150
legalities behind NAT or at the senior
examples event in the city's

864
00:50:52,150 --> 00:50:56,350
so what you're saying is you got in
philadelphia you have people that

865
00:50:56,350 --> 00:51:00,400
identify cameras and then make sure that
there's like surveillance cameras

866
00:51:00,400 --> 00:51:02,500
watching the the public spaces

867
00:51:02,500 --> 00:51:06,280
and those are the concerns from central
registry year like if you have a webcam

868
00:51:06,280 --> 00:51:09,840
and you just went even on your problem
has to be playing outside didn't tell

869
00:51:09,840 --> 00:51:10,480
the you'll

870
00:51:10,480 --> 00:51:14,400
precinct hey i've a web camera is at
this address and then they

871
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:17,590
no debt so there's a crime then they can
basically go to you

872
00:51:17,590 --> 00:51:21,510
%uh and as a private citizen you can
hand it over ABC and the examples that

873
00:51:21,510 --> 00:51:23,630
was Billy just unique and everything
else

874
00:51:23,630 --> 00:51:28,220
here I haven't heard that

875
00:51:28,220 --> 00:51:31,320
and I mean what I mean into this is
brother the the discussion we have to

876
00:51:31,320 --> 00:51:35,990
think about your private citizens with
censorship governments were sensors

877
00:51:35,990 --> 00:51:39,210
having a central registry of their on
one hand is good I mean

878
00:51:39,210 --> 00:51:42,680
I think generally transparencies good
but some

879
00:51:42,680 --> 00:51:45,750
also makes me nervous for where can't
really figure

880
00:51:45,750 --> 00:51:49,150
thanks very much sure thank you

881
00:51:49,150 --> 00:51:52,590
in yeah

882
00:51:52,590 --> 00:51:56,390
yesterday do during Stephen ROM bombs
presentation

883
00:51:56,390 --> 00:52:00,470
we were shown customs lines have people
with ski masks on

884
00:52:00,470 --> 00:52:03,970
we could see their eyes and maybe their
skin right below their eyes

885
00:52:03,970 --> 00:52:07,110
and according to mister fromm bomb on

886
00:52:07,110 --> 00:52:10,820
secure lemme facialed our recognition

887
00:52:10,820 --> 00:52:14,200
only needs about five percent of
someone's face yet

888
00:52:14,200 --> 00:52:17,900
in your slides you had something
different we're maybe the dead the face

889
00:52:17,900 --> 00:52:19,130
was being disguised

890
00:52:19,130 --> 00:52:24,260
so could you talk about are what
actually can disguise visual rock

891
00:52:24,260 --> 00:52:27,870
avoid facial recognition and 129 your

892
00:52:27,870 --> 00:52:31,730
I mean it depends don't have them keep
believe the software in the San surgery

893
00:52:31,730 --> 00:52:35,170
can they get enough for the sample that
unique enough to to perform

894
00:52:35,170 --> 00:52:37,050
identification that they wish

895
00:52:37,050 --> 00:52:41,980
the the was drawn from for that's why I
was based on the dot com park but I

896
00:52:41,980 --> 00:52:43,070
referenced

897
00:52:43,070 --> 00:52:47,090
arm so I mean in in that aren't they
you're talking about and demonstrated

898
00:52:47,090 --> 00:52:49,220
that in certain common algorithms

899
00:52:49,220 --> 00:52:52,570
that that official %uh that make up
those hair designs

900
00:52:52,570 --> 00:52:56,100
would prevent facial detection the first
place for prostrate

901
00:52:56,100 --> 00:52:59,870
official recognition however absolutely
i mean

902
00:52:59,870 --> 00:53:03,009
that wasn't Stevens talks in the
wonderful

903
00:53:03,010 --> 00:53:06,300
are I could if your eyes are there

904
00:53:06,300 --> 00:53:10,060
you know usually rest were just pens
down what technology up against re

905
00:53:10,060 --> 00:53:13,950
what time the database doesn't have
behind so okay so we're really down to

906
00:53:13,950 --> 00:53:14,890
two minutes

907
00:53:14,890 --> 00:53:18,740
I i think we'll go ahead and and wrap up
at this time

908
00:53:18,740 --> 00:53:21,970
and what these my will be on hallway
will be around so we will talk about

909
00:53:21,970 --> 00:53:23,440
this and thank you for your time

910
00:53:23,440 --> 00:53:27,350
beer tent way
