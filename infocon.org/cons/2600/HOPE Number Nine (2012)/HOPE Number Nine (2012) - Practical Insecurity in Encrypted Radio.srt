1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,029
be shortly after they happen actually
think we're burning discs on sites if

2
00:00:04,029 --> 00:00:06,230
you could check the merge tables as
you're there that's a great way once

3
00:00:06,230 --> 00:00:07,339
again if you are an academic

4
00:00:07,339 --> 00:00:11,030
sticking times your students or your
parents or whoever else needs to hear

5
00:00:11,030 --> 00:00:11,450
things

6
00:00:11,450 --> 00:00:14,650
the room and talk is always greater
scare people on the submission about our

7
00:00:14,650 --> 00:00:17,029
privacy and things like that and

8
00:00:17,029 --> 00:00:21,289
great so introducing medleys and see in
court

9
00:00:21,289 --> 00:00:24,800
and I forget your title but it's going
to be awesome so they're ready

10
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:31,800
gonna where yes it is OK

11
00:00:34,390 --> 00:00:37,730
I arm so this is actually going to work

12
00:00:37,730 --> 00:00:42,410
from a Sammy I are here Travis is God
knows where

13
00:00:42,410 --> 00:00:45,940
on Perry Metzger a might or might not be
here

14
00:00:45,940 --> 00:00:49,980
%uh jackpot for men and Kevin Xu are are
not here

15
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:53,320
%uh so there to us here in 20 that's
kinda meh disable so

16
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:56,680
wealthy so I'm I'm gonna talk about

17
00:00:56,680 --> 00:01:01,109
is some work that we've been working on
over the last three years

18
00:01:01,109 --> 00:01:04,799
we only um a first

19
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:08,299
released last year although I'm going to
talk about a little more detail

20
00:01:08,299 --> 00:01:11,720
on then then we've talked about in the
past

21
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:15,380
which is going to require me to put up
by BP disclaimers

22
00:01:15,380 --> 00:01:19,689
Obama but I have to put one up here
partial support for this work

23
00:01:19,689 --> 00:01:23,710
are was from the National Science
Foundation complain we are very turned

24
00:01:23,710 --> 00:01:24,259
on

25
00:01:24,259 --> 00:01:27,270
you know grateful for their enormous
generosity but

26
00:01:27,270 --> 00:01:31,500
they asked me to point out that any
opinions findings and conclusions or

27
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:34,320
recommendations expressed in this
material are those of the author and do

28
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:37,579
not necessarily reflect the views of the
National fine thanks foundation

29
00:01:37,579 --> 00:01:41,490
where the United States government and
that it turns out is absolutely true

30
00:01:41,490 --> 00:01:43,680
on

31
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:49,040
am so yeah I mean we're necessarily is
really unnecessary in this

32
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:53,080
I'm okay okay so I'm not talk about

33
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:56,920
are a basically a security protocol that
has

34
00:01:56,920 --> 00:02:00,700
nothing or very little to do with the
internet we decided to

35
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:04,470
to do something a little bit different
from the normal

36
00:02:04,470 --> 00:02:08,160
kinda internet security model am pretty
to look at

37
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:11,319
on Wireless security that also isn't

38
00:02:11,319 --> 00:02:14,770
802 got 11 which is the wireless
security that we usually look

39
00:02:14,770 --> 00:02:18,060
we decided to look at the I'm security

40
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:22,450
properties I'll two-way radio systems
that are designed

41
00:02:22,450 --> 00:02:25,959
to be secured in particular we look at
it something called

42
00:02:25,959 --> 00:02:31,930
apk own project 25 this implies that
there were 24 before it but I believe

43
00:02:31,930 --> 00:02:34,150
that the one before it was 16

44
00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:37,850
on so I'm I'm not sure what's going on
there with the numbering

45
00:02:37,850 --> 00:02:43,019
ap ko is the Association public safety
got squares are detected on public

46
00:02:43,019 --> 00:02:43,650
safety

47
00:02:43,650 --> 00:02:46,750
communications officers arm it

48
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:51,519
use arm basically the group but that sex
along with the

49
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:55,269
federal government and and vendors the

50
00:02:55,269 --> 00:02:58,400
I'm protocols Ford

51
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:03,489
various land mobile two-way radio system
such as their use by the police

52
00:03:03,489 --> 00:03:06,600
and the federal government and and and
others

53
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:09,709
on acecomm project 25

54
00:03:09,709 --> 00:03:14,590
argues for the officially blessed US
government standard for

55
00:03:14,590 --> 00:03:17,880
a narrow band two way radio that
intended

56
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:21,450
to replace the analog FM systems that
are currently being used

57
00:03:21,450 --> 00:03:24,660
and so it's its its main design property

58
00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:28,140
that mean design requirement and has
been edited

59
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:32,000
it be backwards compatible with the
spectrum management

60
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,590
that came before it for the a.m systems
so it's not

61
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:39,609
will you know if you were designing
two-way radio from scratch you probably

62
00:03:39,609 --> 00:03:40,400
do offered

63
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:45,190
amazing things like spread spectrum and
you know a cognitive radio in frequency

64
00:03:45,190 --> 00:03:46,230
hopping and so on

65
00:03:46,230 --> 00:03:49,280
they're using you know individual
channelized

66
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:53,130
arm a radio are just like

67
00:03:53,130 --> 00:03:57,500
we were using me analog days in order to
allow a transition and not require

68
00:03:57,500 --> 00:04:00,000
everybody to change everything it wants
and

69
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,150
and and have contractual the existing
equipment

70
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:07,989
the idea is that this would be a
standard in which one size fits

71
00:04:07,989 --> 00:04:12,090
not made maybe not all but as many as as
possible

72
00:04:12,090 --> 00:04:15,870
on its own the users have this are

73
00:04:15,870 --> 00:04:20,019
intended to be a local police two-way
radio dispatch

74
00:04:20,019 --> 00:04:24,229
arm but also on things like the federal
government

75
00:04:24,229 --> 00:04:27,880
on people performing surveillance you
know there are we're not gonna talk

76
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:29,120
about specific

77
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:32,650
names and agencies but you might imagine
that there are bureaus have the federal

78
00:04:32,650 --> 00:04:34,900
government to perform investigations

79
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:38,780
on the ODA they would use things like
this there are services that are

80
00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:39,850
somewhat secret

81
00:04:39,850 --> 00:04:43,160
but use things like this and and and ask
someone

82
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:47,630
so other while local two-way radio
dispatch systems

83
00:04:47,630 --> 00:04:53,320
a tend not to use the security features
of this they tend to be relatively

84
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:57,699
on up open because interoperability is a
big problem for

85
00:04:57,699 --> 00:05:01,500
on local police two-way radio systems
that have to deal with other agencies

86
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:02,650
that are nearby

87
00:05:02,650 --> 00:05:05,710
there other users have this that care
quite a bit

88
00:05:05,710 --> 00:05:09,830
about the confidentiality and and
resistance could and I look service and

89
00:05:09,830 --> 00:05:12,919
and and so on so so the same

90
00:05:12,919 --> 00:05:17,030
standard that's used for your local
police in your local fire department and

91
00:05:17,030 --> 00:05:17,750
EMS

92
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:22,740
I is intended to also serve the needs of
people who whose primary problem is

93
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:25,960
arm confidentiality and security

94
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:30,979
in their communications so %uh there's
this standard dates back

95
00:05:30,979 --> 00:05:34,900
to the early nineties equipment started
to come out on the market in

96
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:38,300
earnest arm about ten years ago

97
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:41,520
I'm twelve years ago up there's an hour

98
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:45,039
barely wide range of equipment to 'em

99
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:49,040
arm bed being sold there are several
vendors motorola is

100
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:53,110
probably the dominant vendor in the US
Federal

101
00:05:53,110 --> 00:05:57,800
on from sector but the intention is that
the equipment is standardized and it

102
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:00,150
doesn't really matter which renders
equipment to use

103
00:06:00,150 --> 00:06:04,810
herder your picture of a typical arm
your previous generation

104
00:06:04,810 --> 00:06:08,659
p25 radio I have no years but but
current generation

105
00:06:08,659 --> 00:06:11,800
main difference is that it's more
expensive arm

106
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:15,199
the a am the

107
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:19,129
user interface is very little bit from
piece of equipment to these recruitment

108
00:06:19,129 --> 00:06:20,340
the butter largely

109
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:24,169
standardized and the standard has code
bases

110
00:06:24,169 --> 00:06:27,460
associated with the everybody can skip
work

111
00:06:27,460 --> 00:06:30,889
from so there there's not a

112
00:06:30,889 --> 00:06:34,060
a lot of heterogeneity their 'em

113
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:39,300
okay so me an example from the user's I
went looking for photos of people using

114
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:42,879
I'm the use a radio to get a sense %uh
who

115
00:06:42,879 --> 00:06:46,169
other than a local law enforcement is
heard on the left is a picture from the

116
00:06:46,169 --> 00:06:48,580
New York Times about go warfighters

117
00:06:48,580 --> 00:06:53,599
in Afghanistan and we see a prominent
picture a Motorola XTS

118
00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:56,628
5,000 radio arm

119
00:06:56,629 --> 00:07:01,389
there's a a photo from an official White
House photo on

120
00:07:01,389 --> 00:07:06,770
the arm the his security detail at the
white house

121
00:07:06,770 --> 00:07:10,698
during a the banquet that people crashed
a few years ago

122
00:07:10,699 --> 00:07:17,310
I think in 2009 on in that could picture
back have a secret service agent in her

123
00:07:17,310 --> 00:07:21,319
evening dress is Scott awkwardly area

124
00:07:21,319 --> 00:07:24,370
very heavy large walkie-talkie

125
00:07:24,370 --> 00:07:27,490
are back but at the end of those little
boiled your phone's

126
00:07:27,490 --> 00:07:32,159
so under arm pushed yep in the and also
do you mean on the photo you can also

127
00:07:32,159 --> 00:07:32,479
look

128
00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:36,438
you can see the encryption switcher and
it's actually in the clear position

129
00:07:36,439 --> 00:07:40,210
um okay so how does this um how does
this work

130
00:07:40,210 --> 00:07:45,409
arm big it intended to interoperate with

131
00:07:45,409 --> 00:07:50,469
a you know the the old analog FM systems
that use the twelve and a half

132
00:07:50,469 --> 00:07:54,998
delivered wide our channel and be a trap
for you except for what have you

133
00:07:54,999 --> 00:07:58,090
using a c4 FM which is less clear simple

134
00:07:58,090 --> 00:08:03,599
quadrature modulation arm to bits per
symbol at 4800 beeps

135
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:07,849
are the symbols per second so to ninety
9.6 K

136
00:08:07,849 --> 00:08:12,699
but our channel on the main bearer
services Bouygues

137
00:08:12,699 --> 00:08:16,039
and there's a standard vocoder on

138
00:08:16,039 --> 00:08:20,590
well call Diane be even give you pretty
high intelligibility

139
00:08:20,590 --> 00:08:24,810
on at bit I had that bit rate and
tolerates

140
00:08:24,810 --> 00:08:28,810
evers in transmission over radio pretty
well so exited

141
00:08:28,810 --> 00:08:33,549
pretty happily optimize grouper for
voice applications that

142
00:08:33,549 --> 00:08:37,650
at this kind of a band with and the
whole model is is broadcast

143
00:08:37,650 --> 00:08:40,919
so know it but in fact we think that
this is true we radio

144
00:08:40,919 --> 00:08:44,218
it actually one way radio with are

145
00:08:44,219 --> 00:08:48,090
a transmitter that make all the
decisions and receivers the kinder

146
00:08:48,090 --> 00:08:52,220
I it's up to them to bind how did to
modulate the signal

147
00:08:52,220 --> 00:08:55,680
you don't do any negotiation from the
receiver back to the sender

148
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:59,920
100 hope is that barrier I'll excellent
here

149
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:03,900
a.m. be a okay so I'm so on average

150
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:07,380
um fifty percent of the people Mike for
might not have been here

151
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:10,439
are here big arm so

152
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:14,840
its essentially a one-way a model of
communication

153
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:18,210
which means there's no negotiation back
for thirty back but there's no notion of

154
00:09:18,210 --> 00:09:20,600
a session there are no acknowledgement
searcher

155
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:24,320
and so on for the police aspect to the
protocol

156
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:28,690
I'm so the security options and again
these are options

157
00:09:28,690 --> 00:09:32,250
are based on technology

158
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:35,330
as in it all the technological
assumptions that you might have wanted

159
00:09:35,330 --> 00:09:36,260
to make

160
00:09:36,260 --> 00:09:39,620
you know in the early nineteen nineties
when the project started

161
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:42,950
arm and be assumptions about how capable
handsets in

162
00:09:42,950 --> 00:09:46,350
user equipment would be the world's
first set in stone

163
00:09:46,350 --> 00:09:50,200
twenty years ago so it's all based on
symmetric encryption there's no public

164
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:51,510
be involved

165
00:09:51,510 --> 00:09:55,500
are they allow for on unclassified
ciphers

166
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:58,750
PSAs and so on there is a plugin
basically

167
00:09:58,750 --> 00:10:02,850
in the standard already currently
standardized on a DS NDS

168
00:10:02,850 --> 00:10:05,950
arm vendor-specific standards like

169
00:10:05,950 --> 00:10:09,760
forty bit rc4 for export model radios

170
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:12,870
on them it's possible to order to use it
for

171
00:10:12,870 --> 00:10:16,260
with classified algorithms as well arm
the

172
00:10:16,260 --> 00:10:19,750
crappy have to be loaded into the radios
in advance

173
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:22,810
it also again of the metric and

174
00:10:22,810 --> 00:10:27,920
how do you do this whether two options
one is with an incredibly cont'd device

175
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:31,089
a call the key loader on which you can
work

176
00:10:31,090 --> 00:10:35,720
he's into the radio with a cable online
it's a little bit larger than one other

177
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:40,670
radios themselves you're in.
over-the-air rekeying protocol

178
00:10:40,670 --> 00:10:44,560
in which you the radios in advance but
can change he's over the air from a

179
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:46,260
centralized base station

180
00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:50,890
and these can be set to either expire
self-destruct be erased

181
00:10:50,890 --> 00:10:54,140
on at their various intervals

182
00:10:54,140 --> 00:10:58,400
so so here's some the communications
model this has to be one size fits all

183
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:02,600
so they made the following sex love
glove decisions

184
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:06,460
riverboats the broadcast model ducks
backs dictated by the nature and the

185
00:11:06,460 --> 00:11:07,170
channel

186
00:11:07,170 --> 00:11:11,199
so there no two-way sessions there's no
knowledge minner negotiation

187
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:14,950
on you will all we use

188
00:11:14,950 --> 00:11:19,400
play over the speaker did you receive
clear text on your channel

189
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:22,980
and it's got it on the correct frequency
with the correct

190
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:27,110
on network identify your you always play
clear tax

191
00:11:27,110 --> 00:11:30,590
that you receive over your local speaker
Arabia

192
00:11:30,590 --> 00:11:35,300
on if they protect comes in you look and
see if you have the correct

193
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:39,130
he did the crib it and if you do you
always

194
00:11:39,130 --> 00:11:44,380
arm up a try to prepare if you had to be
material to do so

195
00:11:44,380 --> 00:11:48,970
arm are if you don't bring your radio
will remain silent when

196
00:11:48,970 --> 00:11:52,220
and imprinted traffic comes in arm

197
00:11:52,220 --> 00:11:56,190
and that happens regardless of the state
if your radio you always play clear text

198
00:11:56,190 --> 00:11:59,150
that comes in with the correct network
code on the right treatment the annual

199
00:11:59,150 --> 00:12:03,740
always play cipher text but but you have
to be material for that comes in on your

200
00:12:03,740 --> 00:12:07,190
frequency with the correct on network ok

201
00:12:07,190 --> 00:12:12,280
on the same things I'd arm you needed to
make all the security decisions whether

202
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:16,160
you are in the clear we're in protect
mode on your outbound transmissions is

203
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:18,530
up to the spenders radio entire

204
00:12:18,530 --> 00:12:22,410
there's no way for a sender and receiver
and say hey I got this key

205
00:12:22,410 --> 00:12:25,709
why don't we use this key because a this

206
00:12:25,710 --> 00:12:29,340
this completely a one-way model even
though that

207
00:12:29,340 --> 00:12:32,430
it's a one-way model in which the roles
are changing back and forth

208
00:12:32,430 --> 00:12:36,070
like frequently and the standard
configuration there's a switch on the

209
00:12:36,070 --> 00:12:36,980
radio

210
00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:40,470
arm that gergen's which between clear
mode and

211
00:12:40,470 --> 00:12:45,190
and improve did not work okay so we
decided to go to look

212
00:12:45,190 --> 00:12:48,410
at I have secure this was arm

213
00:12:48,410 --> 00:12:51,579
and we you know we we wrote a paper on
this in

214
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:54,870
the person we discovered was that are
open from obvious mistakes that you

215
00:12:54,870 --> 00:12:56,230
could make that we were

216
00:12:56,230 --> 00:12:59,700
Anna secretly hoping that they make so
that we could write about it

217
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:03,260
on and and you know spend five minutes
looking at the standard and discovered

218
00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:03,950
have you know that

219
00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:06,830
all you know if you actually the first
packet with the second package you get

220
00:13:06,830 --> 00:13:08,410
the key or something like that

221
00:13:08,410 --> 00:13:12,850
and you know they don't do any of the
the the crazily bad things that

222
00:13:12,850 --> 00:13:16,200
better the go often happen on but

223
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:22,210
there some worrisome things on bid
design news apparently completely ad hoc

224
00:13:22,210 --> 00:13:26,540
are that is there there are no arm
security requirements that are stated we

225
00:13:26,540 --> 00:13:28,079
we can't really measure

226
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:32,640
how secure this is are against any
properties that it's supposed to happen

227
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:37,189
and we also found that there were some
significant protocol weaknesses analog

228
00:13:37,190 --> 00:13:40,700
a pop up in very briefly animal will
highlight some

229
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:43,960
purses are no authentication anywhere in
the boys protocol

230
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:47,980
on so it's possible to I'm to
impersonating

231
00:13:47,980 --> 00:13:51,230
fairly straightforwardly up the second
is that it odes

232
00:13:51,230 --> 00:13:55,310
inherently susceptible to traffic
analysis because radios have a unique

233
00:13:55,310 --> 00:13:57,570
identifiers that they send out

234
00:13:57,570 --> 00:14:01,270
arm in the clear you can if they're in
prison record mode

235
00:14:01,270 --> 00:14:05,980
and then we we found some um very
efficient denial of service attacks

236
00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:09,470
that to allow are an adversary to use

237
00:14:09,470 --> 00:14:12,590
14 decibels left energy

238
00:14:12,590 --> 00:14:16,100
ban everything they're trying to grab so
it's actually more efficient

239
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:20,150
could jam when to use 'em legitimately

240
00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:23,459
which is usually not a good property
comps have

241
00:14:23,460 --> 00:14:27,220
on we also found a in the equipment
there were some really serious

242
00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:30,730
%uh a usability weaknesses that will
talk about my second

243
00:14:30,730 --> 00:14:34,370
okay so pleased to hear some examples of
some practical attacks that we found we

244
00:14:34,370 --> 00:14:36,250
we duplicated all these

245
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:39,510
or in the lab president no
authentication problem

246
00:14:39,510 --> 00:14:43,069
the voice traffic can be in pretty good
but you don't get any assurance

247
00:14:43,070 --> 00:14:47,720
about where it came from there's no
indication which user it came from

248
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:52,340
and there's no protection against replay
you were or splicing attacks and so on

249
00:14:52,340 --> 00:14:57,650
arm do it also clear text will always be
received any way to even if you don't

250
00:14:57,650 --> 00:14:58,189
wanna

251
00:14:58,190 --> 00:15:01,700
replace something you know if this
transmit out in the clear

252
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:06,470
are the union argues displayed is not
authenticated many way

253
00:15:06,470 --> 00:15:09,620
and I'm you know they included

254
00:15:09,620 --> 00:15:13,950
are a nAES GCM mode which those whom you
were pretty go

255
00:15:13,950 --> 00:15:18,160
types will recognize as a as an
authenticated encryption mother

256
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:21,810
that could fix this problem but it
actually isn't used in a way that does

257
00:15:21,810 --> 00:15:25,840
fix the problems good used as a drop in
safer with the same

258
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:29,190
not authenticating property that the
existing

259
00:15:29,190 --> 00:15:33,450
want so that that sort about you know to
a fundamental

260
00:15:33,450 --> 00:15:36,450
on weakness in the in the design of the
system

261
00:15:36,450 --> 00:15:40,430
bug maybe you could say that it's it's
Italian disco people what it's intended

262
00:15:40,430 --> 00:15:41,330
to do

263
00:15:41,330 --> 00:15:44,680
and all a little later we'll talk about
some other

264
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:48,750
im using finger-pointing that goes on we
describe problems like this in field

265
00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:52,190
systems on Beckham is better being

266
00:15:52,190 --> 00:15:56,720
arm the system is incredibly vulnerable
to traffic analysis both have an app

267
00:15:56,720 --> 00:16:00,500
active a talk about the simple one first
on your do

268
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:04,030
every radios but you need identify your

269
00:16:04,030 --> 00:16:07,880
and they're usually any bid on have to
be but there'd typically you need

270
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:11,170
arm a 24-bit identify your are

271
00:16:11,170 --> 00:16:15,360
you send out with every transmission now
the standard

272
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:19,120
bob says that if you're in in protected
mode you should be in predicting

273
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:22,850
the unit ID from along with the

274
00:16:22,850 --> 00:16:27,430
with the rescued the traffic bigger
imprint going

275
00:16:27,430 --> 00:16:31,640
but we we discovered and as far as I
know we discovered

276
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:35,410
entirely just good because we were the
first people to took a look

277
00:16:35,410 --> 00:16:38,410
I'm we wanted to see you okay how to
what is being prepared

278
00:16:38,410 --> 00:16:41,730
unit ID looked like there is there any
traffic analysis who turned up in

279
00:16:41,730 --> 00:16:44,830
pretending to be something like
exploring with all the rows

280
00:16:44,830 --> 00:16:49,570
arm because a the you do with found out
that inning for different weakens the

281
00:16:49,570 --> 00:16:51,880
unit ID is all we sent out in the clear

282
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:55,040
i've even if the could go is actually

283
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:59,260
are enable so that means that passive
traffic analysis is really easy

284
00:16:59,260 --> 00:17:02,660
you just record the identifiers that are
supposed to be in pretty good that there

285
00:17:02,660 --> 00:17:03,540
aren't

286
00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:06,909
on but are close so backs arm

287
00:17:06,909 --> 00:17:10,530
you know an unfortunate property but we
found that there's an active attack

288
00:17:10,530 --> 00:17:11,270
that's actually

289
00:17:11,270 --> 00:17:14,799
even even more worrisome switches that

290
00:17:14,799 --> 00:17:18,129
on radios that use the data service

291
00:17:18,130 --> 00:17:22,020
arm which isn't any radio using the
over-the-air repaying protocol

292
00:17:22,020 --> 00:17:25,639
will respond to particularly malformed
packet

293
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:29,140
that actors paintings and will arm

294
00:17:29,140 --> 00:17:33,669
arm essentially sent sent back pain
negative acknowledgement because I

295
00:17:33,669 --> 00:17:35,850
didn't quite understand that the

296
00:17:35,850 --> 00:17:39,309
message was was no good for you can

297
00:17:39,309 --> 00:17:42,668
paying a radio even when it's not
transmitting if you're an active

298
00:17:42,669 --> 00:17:45,020
adversary and get it unit identify your

299
00:17:45,020 --> 00:17:48,830
to come back and you could direction
finder so with this book

300
00:17:48,830 --> 00:17:52,178
that invisible know the person wearing
the radio

301
00:17:52,179 --> 00:17:54,940
I miss you but your finger stuck in the
antennas that you're actually feeling

302
00:17:54,940 --> 00:17:55,940
that some heat

303
00:17:55,940 --> 00:17:59,380
powers going on a bit you don't know the
arena's responding right

304
00:17:59,380 --> 00:18:02,390
at night and and so did completely
invisible to use ok so this

305
00:18:02,390 --> 00:18:06,010
in a min up and i own margo sheltered
her murder the

306
00:18:06,010 --> 00:18:10,179
the the name no legs for you you build
the Harry Potter Marauders map

307
00:18:10,179 --> 00:18:13,190
on where you can see where all of the
watchers are

308
00:18:13,190 --> 00:18:17,309
arm on automatically so you can get some
sleep in a radio

309
00:18:17,309 --> 00:18:21,820
Brewer had set up to base stations with
things like the new radios and a

310
00:18:21,820 --> 00:18:26,139
phased array antenna that will give you
on Rock Center direction

311
00:18:26,140 --> 00:18:29,500
and automatically get a a real-time map

312
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:34,080
own where everybody on a given channel
are use radio by radio

313
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:37,280
on now you is that a is that a threat

314
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:41,379
well you know in law enforcement
environment that you arguably it's a

315
00:18:41,380 --> 00:18:45,039
it's a threat against us serious
adversary who's willing to

316
00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:48,070
arm in Baskin inactive attacks in

317
00:18:48,070 --> 00:18:52,009
willing to risk arm you know the
possibility of being detected because

318
00:18:52,009 --> 00:18:54,080
you had actually actively transmitting

319
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:57,879
in order to do this on but a young
couple were pointing out if we go back

320
00:18:57,879 --> 00:18:58,409
to the

321
00:18:58,409 --> 00:19:01,870
picture on you know the military is
using

322
00:19:01,870 --> 00:19:05,320
these these radios knowing where troops
are

323
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:09,059
is often considered to be somewhat of a
tactical advantage

324
00:19:09,059 --> 00:19:12,610
military operations on so I'm called

325
00:19:12,610 --> 00:19:16,440
I've never actually been her okay on so

326
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:21,460
good look at denial of service on the
radio has interesting property which is

327
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:22,039
that

328
00:19:22,039 --> 00:19:25,950
on in general denial of service is a
problem

329
00:19:25,950 --> 00:19:29,159
in radio but it's a relatively easy
evenly matched

330
00:19:29,159 --> 00:19:34,230
arms rings so if I want to prevent your
signal from being heard

331
00:19:34,230 --> 00:19:37,919
what I need to do is put mmm a little
bit more energy typically about 3

332
00:19:37,919 --> 00:19:39,970
decibels more energy out

333
00:19:39,970 --> 00:19:43,029
on the frequency has received at the
receiver then

334
00:19:43,029 --> 00:19:47,240
um the legitimate transmitter and I
could be effectively block

335
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:50,850
are its signal another sprint spectrum

336
00:19:50,850 --> 00:19:55,190
systems that use either speed birds
spreading voter some fairly clever

337
00:19:55,190 --> 00:19:58,200
arm techniques that can actually tip

338
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:01,590
the advantage the defender and require

339
00:20:01,590 --> 00:20:07,049
the I'm jammer you significantly more
energy than the defender

340
00:20:07,049 --> 00:20:10,179
other legitimate transmitter a good
ramen signal

341
00:20:10,179 --> 00:20:16,100
arm an you know that the a idea is that
you know at some point the power budget

342
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:17,309
the bad guy

343
00:20:17,309 --> 00:20:20,379
a.m. I just gets exhausted so you

344
00:20:20,379 --> 00:20:23,960
you use a clever enough system you can
make yourself resistant to jamming

345
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:27,970
and in you know a grammar also is that
significant risk

346
00:20:27,970 --> 00:20:33,440
%uh being direction ok so no in general
YouTube during bball on breaks

347
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:36,710
in a typical narrowband system or one
that is very

348
00:20:36,710 --> 00:20:40,919
likely you can pen to be tipped into the
manager the defender

349
00:20:40,919 --> 00:20:45,499
on if you're using a spread spectrum
system but Cup u20 by managers can get

350
00:20:45,499 --> 00:20:48,590
that wrong in a really profoundly bad
way

351
00:20:48,590 --> 00:20:53,840
arm so um what people defied does it
uses aggressive error correction codes

352
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:55,039
which is good

353
00:20:55,039 --> 00:20:59,019
are aggressive error correction means I
have to jam more of your signal in order

354
00:20:59,019 --> 00:21:02,370
heard it from being understood and so
that look like a step in the right

355
00:21:02,370 --> 00:21:03,470
direction

356
00:21:03,470 --> 00:21:07,009
but they don't care a wrecked the entire
frame

357
00:21:07,009 --> 00:21:10,320
arm over the same error correction code

358
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:13,490
baby out ever correctly subfield

359
00:21:13,490 --> 00:21:17,080
a bit arm separately Voice frame it
turns out

360
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:20,999
is 1728 bids lawn

361
00:21:20,999 --> 00:21:24,580
budget has a 64-bit subfield

362
00:21:24,580 --> 00:21:27,710
let their after error correction a
64-bit

363
00:21:27,710 --> 00:21:31,580
subfield that says this is a voice
spring

364
00:21:31,580 --> 00:21:35,539
and back it turns out you really need to
receive that 64-bit

365
00:21:35,539 --> 00:21:40,460
subfield other actually only about 12
important bits but their error corrected

366
00:21:40,460 --> 00:21:43,529
with a lot of extra redundancy but it's
very important

367
00:21:43,529 --> 00:21:47,409
abut if you damn only in that 64-bit
subfield

368
00:21:47,409 --> 00:21:52,909
arm then you can prevent the entire
other girls 1600 and some odd bits from

369
00:21:52,909 --> 00:21:56,639
from being decoded because we don't know
what kind they are on the receiving

370
00:21:56,639 --> 00:22:01,779
side to eventually you have to gym 32
said the symbols are every 864

371
00:22:01,779 --> 00:22:05,409
symbols that are being sent what one
small thing did did Matt Mike

372
00:22:05,409 --> 00:22:09,490
have daughter implicitly that some love
you might be thinking of in the audience

373
00:22:09,490 --> 00:22:13,929
why sixteen oh my fellow I know you know
64 bits you know might seem oh that's

374
00:22:13,929 --> 00:22:18,440
that's a tiny thing but these are very
very very slow signals there's

375
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:23,860
there's only one 9600 its 9600 it's a
second so 64 symbols is

376
00:22:23,860 --> 00:22:27,320
actually a long time by me dome

377
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:30,970
too long to do by hand accused an
automatic and about Robert so

378
00:22:30,970 --> 00:22:34,440
the question is can you think her nice
you are

379
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:39,440
um than you think for NYE to hit the 64
bits that you have to hit

380
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:43,529
if you're the jammer arm accurately in
our

381
00:22:43,529 --> 00:22:47,039
tailored to allow you to get away with
not transmitting

382
00:22:47,039 --> 00:22:50,629
for the rest of the time because if you
could that would give you

383
00:22:50,629 --> 00:22:55,789
effectively a 14 decibel advantage has
the camera over the legitimate receiver

384
00:22:55,789 --> 00:22:59,139
which you let me just point out this is
phenomenally horrible about

385
00:22:59,139 --> 00:23:03,190
that works I'm okay so how hard is it to
build one

386
00:23:03,190 --> 00:23:07,129
so idk thanks to Travis on he observed

387
00:23:07,129 --> 00:23:12,499
that um there's a script called but he
ICC 1110

388
00:23:12,499 --> 00:23:16,129
it's a family a personal trip are radio
transceivers

389
00:23:16,129 --> 00:23:19,399
that uses c4 FM modulation

390
00:23:19,399 --> 00:23:22,730
an you know different versions of the
trip will work in

391
00:23:22,730 --> 00:23:26,029
all the same frequency bands the p25
radios

392
00:23:26,029 --> 00:23:29,600
argues now put out about a hundred
Millat have energy it's really not a

393
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:32,899
particularly high powered thing but you
can hook up a really dumb external

394
00:23:32,899 --> 00:23:35,450
amplifier after to get more power than
that

395
00:23:35,450 --> 00:23:38,840
I and you only have goedkope of that for
a little while have anything about this

396
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:42,360
trip is it an embedded microprocessor
that you can program

397
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:46,509
arm and I'm you had both a receiver and
transmitter and

398
00:23:46,509 --> 00:23:51,289
a and its programmable on the trip where
you can have it receive and then control

399
00:23:51,289 --> 00:23:52,799
the behavior the transmitter

400
00:23:52,799 --> 00:23:56,389
whoever turns out that's just what you
need in order to do this

401
00:23:56,389 --> 00:24:00,999
so how do you get the script well you
can buy them from tima cost about $25

402
00:24:00,999 --> 00:24:01,929
bucks each

403
00:24:01,929 --> 00:24:05,610
or you can buy products that use them
that for some reason are cheaper than

404
00:24:05,610 --> 00:24:06,779
buying the trips that are

405
00:24:06,779 --> 00:24:11,519
in them I know the economics have
consumer products are mysterious coming

406
00:24:11,519 --> 00:24:15,210
on so we %um the discovered that there's
this device

407
00:24:15,210 --> 00:24:19,129
offend you have it there i'd did its
marketed admirals

408
00:24:19,129 --> 00:24:23,879
a good girl pack I am me it's like the
the radio happening dream device

409
00:24:23,879 --> 00:24:27,179
they're basically about conferred thirty
dollars they come in pairs you can text

410
00:24:27,179 --> 00:24:28,190
to each other

411
00:24:28,190 --> 00:24:31,360
and if you are are if you are Travis

412
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:35,369
or you know Travis you get a programming
get to load your own firmware into the

413
00:24:35,369 --> 00:24:35,990
bank

414
00:24:35,990 --> 00:24:39,049
Ando so we found a it was possible to
build be

415
00:24:39,049 --> 00:24:43,210
planet IM me text messager into the my
first grammar

416
00:24:43,210 --> 00:24:48,610
on and a you weep reprogrammed it
automatically exit on everybody be late

417
00:24:48,610 --> 00:24:51,789
for people earning by single to come in
and an automatic the gamma

418
00:24:51,789 --> 00:24:55,509
and lo and behold it kinda it actually
works on

419
00:24:55,509 --> 00:25:00,230
now we didn't actually JM real
transmissions we did this on our screen

420
00:25:00,230 --> 00:25:04,159
lab room but you hook up an external
amplifier do with this could easily

421
00:25:04,159 --> 00:25:07,679
you work over an entire metropolitan
area had met Anna

422
00:25:07,679 --> 00:25:11,809
situated in the right place okay so
what's the scenario on which you use

423
00:25:11,809 --> 00:25:16,178
one dumb scenario is good just damn
everything but that's not really

424
00:25:16,179 --> 00:25:19,190
that's not a very smart thing to do with
your under surveillance

425
00:25:19,190 --> 00:25:22,580
because then you'll never find out what
they're doing much better would be to

426
00:25:22,580 --> 00:25:23,989
convince the people

427
00:25:23,989 --> 00:25:28,690
who are um who are up putting you under
surveillance

428
00:25:28,690 --> 00:25:32,210
that the encryption isn't working so
only DRAM

429
00:25:32,210 --> 00:25:35,629
good signals when you see them on hand
works

430
00:25:35,629 --> 00:25:40,129
%uh the I'll people the garage jamming

431
00:25:40,129 --> 00:25:43,710
to switch their radios and the clear
modem and it turns out bed

432
00:25:43,710 --> 00:25:48,200
your PIN if people are conditioned to
believe that the crib go is unreliable

433
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:51,350
upgrade they won't think anything all
you know but see all the damn printer

434
00:25:51,350 --> 00:25:52,759
wasn't working downloads

435
00:25:52,759 --> 00:25:55,989
for better pretty clear that always
works better

436
00:25:55,989 --> 00:25:59,269
on so the downgraded hackers
interestingly

437
00:25:59,269 --> 00:26:03,570
Usenet conditioning on he's very
prevalent because

438
00:26:03,570 --> 00:26:07,168
analog radios used to be unreliable arm
and sell

439
00:26:07,169 --> 00:26:11,429
they're used to losing reception walking
two feet in one direction losing

440
00:26:11,429 --> 00:26:12,159
reception

441
00:26:12,159 --> 00:26:15,279
sold they think odiaum its record

442
00:26:15,279 --> 00:26:19,539
from her digital ago baby in production
has all the same radio propagation

443
00:26:19,539 --> 00:26:23,950
characteristics the Rangers exactly the
same the boys bodies exactly the same

444
00:26:23,950 --> 00:26:27,049
it was going for being the birds that
are sent over but the

445
00:26:27,049 --> 00:26:30,470
arm there's a lot %uh believe been in
production

446
00:26:30,470 --> 00:26:34,399
degrades the polity you know it's not
actually true anymore would be

447
00:26:34,399 --> 00:26:38,999
burn generation radios them

448
00:26:38,999 --> 00:26:42,299
oh yeah oh you're way ahead we'll get
there yeah

449
00:26:42,299 --> 00:26:46,649
you are just way ahead of us okay so
news million practice so how many people

450
00:26:46,649 --> 00:26:49,720
recognize the symbol your

451
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:53,259
it's that they got the its feet it when
I'm back home

452
00:26:53,259 --> 00:26:56,809
but we we made up for Twitter the radio
so I don't have to Twitter &

453
00:26:56,809 --> 00:27:00,700
it has two conditions on this is one of
them

454
00:27:00,700 --> 00:27:05,799
arm and other there's another one on and
one of them turned in return on the

455
00:27:05,799 --> 00:27:07,039
other kinds at all

456
00:27:07,039 --> 00:27:10,249
on fool you getting same question to you
yeah

457
00:27:10,249 --> 00:27:13,669
but it also has been carded this is the
air conditioning is

458
00:27:13,669 --> 00:27:16,889
closed number one I heard on

459
00:27:16,889 --> 00:27:20,460
missus also you know don't touch ahead
KT yeah

460
00:27:20,460 --> 00:27:24,460
so there's very poor be back in the
radios in practice

461
00:27:24,460 --> 00:27:28,830
about the crib goes big so transmit
crypto is controlled by this

462
00:27:28,830 --> 00:27:32,480
wedge but it has no effect on receive
grid ok so

463
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:35,679
there's no way for you to tell what
you've done by switching the switch

464
00:27:35,679 --> 00:27:36,369
because

465
00:27:36,369 --> 00:27:40,299
what you're receiving work just as well
no matter which positions in

466
00:27:40,299 --> 00:27:43,850
I'm similarly on here you more

467
00:27:43,850 --> 00:27:48,679
arm correctly he you'll be happily
received things even if you are in the

468
00:27:48,679 --> 00:27:53,879
in the beer mug now exacerbating this
problem

469
00:27:53,879 --> 00:27:56,889
is that there is a widespread belief

470
00:27:56,889 --> 00:28:01,899
printed in the manual to mention the
standard that rekeying frequently

471
00:28:01,899 --> 00:28:06,039
is a really good idea for security
because if your radios get captured

472
00:28:06,039 --> 00:28:08,399
while you're over enemy territory

473
00:28:08,399 --> 00:28:11,539
arm you don't want somebody with a
captured radio

474
00:28:11,539 --> 00:28:15,259
to be able to receive your signals on
and you know i i

475
00:28:15,259 --> 00:28:18,889
you know arm federal agents are captured
all the time by

476
00:28:18,889 --> 00:28:23,720
criminal our man %uh you know what
readers are from flatly rejected turned

477
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:24,129
up

478
00:28:24,129 --> 00:28:27,980
they lose their guns which is like this
career ending moon

479
00:28:27,980 --> 00:28:32,529
more often than they lose their radios
so exudes an almost non-existent problem

480
00:28:32,529 --> 00:28:36,070
but this is believed that they need to
re he frequently what happens when you

481
00:28:36,070 --> 00:28:36,918
re P

482
00:28:36,919 --> 00:28:40,799
well the radios have to be repaid one at
a time and when you install the new

483
00:28:40,799 --> 00:28:45,168
near the old he goes away so him and
everybody you're working with doesn't

484
00:28:45,169 --> 00:28:46,249
have the same

485
00:28:46,249 --> 00:28:50,539
he which happens on which is a situation
that will happen more often the more

486
00:28:50,539 --> 00:28:51,869
often you read be

487
00:28:51,869 --> 00:28:56,470
then you're gonna be forced to go into a
clear mode more and more often

488
00:28:56,470 --> 00:28:59,519
so between the fact that you can tell
with the switch does and the fact that

489
00:28:59,519 --> 00:29:02,149
you might not be able to use the trip go

490
00:29:02,149 --> 00:29:05,369
well we we have maybe this is the
usability problem that dead

491
00:29:05,369 --> 00:29:09,580
had some real potential so here we were
the first person to observe that precum

492
00:29:09,580 --> 00:29:10,559
usability

493
00:29:10,559 --> 00:29:15,970
nom it was important home a whittenberg
tigar ok this famous paper in 1999 music

494
00:29:15,970 --> 00:29:16,759
security

495
00:29:16,759 --> 00:29:21,590
although why johnnie camping ripped
where they analyzed the security a PGP

496
00:29:21,590 --> 00:29:24,859
and eventually you know they're better
on Eumundi

497
00:29:24,859 --> 00:29:28,210
have trouble with that and nine digs are
have had

498
00:29:28,210 --> 00:29:32,139
have no chance because there's no
feedback about what's going on

499
00:29:32,139 --> 00:29:35,350
potentially it is almost as a a the

500
00:29:35,350 --> 00:29:40,739
on p25 designers the water we use our
usage model well let's look at PGP

501
00:29:40,739 --> 00:29:44,850
and you know the and and and and do it
that way

502
00:29:44,850 --> 00:29:50,350
on Pozo or almost work line for line you
can look at Whitten and tigar's paper

503
00:29:50,350 --> 00:29:51,359
and an

504
00:29:51,359 --> 00:29:55,399
and at the bike the big event and see
how it wasn't followed in the design of

505
00:29:55,399 --> 00:29:56,519
the system

506
00:29:56,519 --> 00:30:00,159
I'm so here's an example but the typical
radio here's the radioing

507
00:30:00,159 --> 00:30:03,700
in clear mode here's the radio and in
print mode

508
00:30:03,700 --> 00:30:07,350
there's a young player mode in britain
out by removing for good mod

509
00:30:07,350 --> 00:30:10,789
on good yeah so im you

510
00:30:10,789 --> 00:30:14,749
I'm had no notice Ian but never mad
embarrassed to say

511
00:30:14,749 --> 00:30:18,529
I can't remember at the moment have
slashed through the circle was in credit

512
00:30:18,529 --> 00:30:19,029
or not

513
00:30:19,029 --> 00:30:22,460
and I've been working on this with you
for years now yeah

514
00:30:22,460 --> 00:30:25,649
yeah so it turned up a the little switch

515
00:30:25,649 --> 00:30:29,330
with the flash from the serb old means
the metaphors it's puzzling

516
00:30:29,330 --> 00:30:33,379
closed as opposed to open am clearly
that

517
00:30:33,379 --> 00:30:36,379
think I'm so that means and a grim
reaper

518
00:30:36,379 --> 00:30:40,759
on okay so there's also this cumbersome
at the modeling thing remember the

519
00:30:40,759 --> 00:30:41,470
picture

520
00:30:41,470 --> 00:30:45,690
the soldier the radios right here yeah
you can actually turn the secret service

521
00:30:45,690 --> 00:30:47,009
agent 3d is right here

522
00:30:47,009 --> 00:30:50,710
for how the hell even was actually good
for nothing but lies in the back

523
00:30:50,710 --> 00:30:54,919
doctor on going on here yeah

524
00:30:54,919 --> 00:30:58,019
um okay so um bed

525
00:30:58,019 --> 00:31:01,210
be business problem cumbersome bien

526
00:31:01,210 --> 00:31:04,320
on if you do musically you can actually
enter new

527
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:07,668
be back in you know nursery you have to
keep a lid on it

528
00:31:07,669 --> 00:31:10,730
you can actually 100 he is through the
pair on

529
00:31:10,730 --> 00:31:13,929
you have to use either this key variable
loader device

530
00:31:13,929 --> 00:31:17,249
or the over-the-air reading protocol
you're in the area the number to call

531
00:31:17,249 --> 00:31:18,830
for a variety of reasons

532
00:31:18,830 --> 00:31:22,299
bills barely your frequently and
business believe

533
00:31:22,299 --> 00:31:26,509
are in the federal sector that everyone
rekeying is a really good idea for

534
00:31:26,509 --> 00:31:27,409
security

535
00:31:27,409 --> 00:31:31,639
and so they rigorously enforce this is
your weekly or monthly depending on the

536
00:31:31,639 --> 00:31:32,440
agency

537
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:36,519
arm and and for what that means is that
every time there's a rebbe

538
00:31:36,519 --> 00:31:40,779
there's this period I've instability in
which everybody is words to use

539
00:31:40,779 --> 00:31:44,049
clear is that more secure um and so do
you

540
00:31:44,049 --> 00:31:48,499
it takes about a week to stabilize I
some agencies do with weekly

541
00:31:48,499 --> 00:31:51,909
so they give you an idea of how often on

542
00:31:51,909 --> 00:31:55,330
they're forced to use the clear modem on
third

543
00:31:55,330 --> 00:31:59,710
you're in the field are you can do it
who is an example the previous

544
00:31:59,710 --> 00:32:00,419
generation

545
00:32:00,419 --> 00:32:03,369
the loader hardware the current
generation one is actually worse it's

546
00:32:03,369 --> 00:32:04,309
based on a little

547
00:32:04,309 --> 00:32:07,809
who work in the AM has a cocoon you
can't turn it off to the battery going

548
00:32:07,809 --> 00:32:08,590
dead

549
00:32:08,590 --> 00:32:12,019
on the um and the

550
00:32:12,019 --> 00:32:15,669
policy generally involves keeping this
in a safe at headquarters

551
00:32:15,669 --> 00:32:19,059
and not allowing it out into the field
but to me it's if that the beginning a

552
00:32:19,059 --> 00:32:20,168
man operation

553
00:32:20,169 --> 00:32:23,710
we discover that whole Bob doesn't have
to be in his radio

554
00:32:23,710 --> 00:32:26,989
everybody has to switch to clear mud so
yeah

555
00:32:26,989 --> 00:32:30,509
with the kids are really expensive in a
group will only use rehab

556
00:32:30,509 --> 00:32:34,609
one right so so there isn't like like
they're carrying one around in the field

557
00:32:34,609 --> 00:32:37,769
in and it is twenty people milling
operation that they can Ricky

558
00:32:37,769 --> 00:32:41,350
this is done back in the 80s on all the
areas once

559
00:32:41,350 --> 00:32:44,840
it's just such a shame that you could
never right software to let you into a

560
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:46,629
key in on the keypad

561
00:32:46,629 --> 00:32:50,409
your middle school teachers and if you
missed earnings

562
00:32:50,409 --> 00:32:53,720
that's impossible to read so um yeah

563
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:57,309
anyway by Bob Morris who was the who was
a a

564
00:32:57,309 --> 00:33:00,619
good three times as good NSA

565
00:33:00,619 --> 00:33:04,309
arm for a while and read the prior to
that a bell after

566
00:33:04,309 --> 00:33:08,190
bill after and and notorious hacker arm

567
00:33:08,190 --> 00:33:14,529
you was a David Cooper while he was at
NSA at crypto 95 and we were all

568
00:33:14,529 --> 00:33:18,470
eagerly going there because he promised
to reveal the NSA's

569
00:33:18,470 --> 00:33:21,850
secrets have prepared Alice and his
basically his

570
00:33:21,850 --> 00:33:26,809
talk consisted largely %uh repeating the
one hundred and alice is that the NSA

571
00:33:26,809 --> 00:33:28,070
which was bird

572
00:33:28,070 --> 00:33:32,720
look for clear tax and %uh you know
everybody was a little disappointed when

573
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:33,729
bob setback

574
00:33:33,729 --> 00:33:37,950
on but it occurred to us that maybe we
should see if that works

575
00:33:37,950 --> 00:33:42,200
so we decided to build our own little
low-budget NSA

576
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:45,259
on and a week you know we found a

577
00:33:45,259 --> 00:33:48,299
well we don't wanna do I deactivate ax
to

578
00:33:48,299 --> 00:33:51,739
number two the federal government to
find out how over whether

579
00:33:51,739 --> 00:33:55,359
how they react to things like jamming
and so on that would be

580
00:33:55,359 --> 00:33:58,679
friendly but passive attacks according
to our lawyers

581
00:33:58,679 --> 00:34:02,330
were perfectly fine new comp

582
00:34:02,330 --> 00:34:05,370
oh so we are bill airy

583
00:34:05,370 --> 00:34:08,910
a little intercept system to find out
how much unintended

584
00:34:08,909 --> 00:34:13,918
sensitive cleartext is out there and
that was a weird ways

585
00:34:13,918 --> 00:34:16,400
back started with us because we
accidentally can be your one on the

586
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:18,030
radio we were playing with him

587
00:34:18,030 --> 00:34:21,950
we and you know about the frequently run
by like 10 megahertz and suddenly we're

588
00:34:21,949 --> 00:34:22,600
hearing this

589
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:26,639
reference to some surveillance operation
going on in our neighborhood in

590
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:29,690
yeah I will be careful with a
confidential informant beer

591
00:34:29,690 --> 00:34:32,700
but does own so it seems never gone and

592
00:34:32,700 --> 00:34:36,810
what I'm know who this is like having
our own private version of The Wire this

593
00:34:36,810 --> 00:34:37,759
is really interesting

594
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:42,550
on and so we were wondering do you know
how often does this happen

595
00:34:42,550 --> 00:34:47,270
so we decided to collect some statistics
and what we did was we first

596
00:34:47,270 --> 00:34:52,418
found all of the frequencies in the
bands used

597
00:34:52,418 --> 00:34:56,279
by the federal government specifically
we got rid of state and local agencies

598
00:34:56,280 --> 00:35:00,520
that have been pretty good track become
they're mostly consisting

599
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:03,920
a pinprick draft ok and then on

600
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:07,930
we build an infrastructure to collect
all the clear traffic

601
00:35:07,930 --> 00:35:11,480
that comes in on those frequencies along
with timestamps and

602
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:14,770
all the meta data that we collect and we
used

603
00:35:14,770 --> 00:35:19,230
only commercial off-the-shelf equipment
you know we we had a low budget and part

604
00:35:19,230 --> 00:35:22,360
of the point was that you don't really
need special equipment to do that

605
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:25,970
so we we've found a a software
controlled receiver

606
00:35:25,970 --> 00:35:29,980
on public i cum are 2500 has a B-twenty
by

607
00:35:29,980 --> 00:35:33,370
decoder in a her right reasons we're
going to use going to radio but for a

608
00:35:33,370 --> 00:35:35,029
variety of reasons Bamber

609
00:35:35,030 --> 00:35:39,400
performance reviews is better and also
be the difficulty in using them was

610
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:41,630
lower we wanted something that was
within

611
00:35:41,630 --> 00:35:45,040
the possible realm of possibility of an
actual adversary

612
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:48,210
on because we wanted to see what you
know what would an actual

613
00:35:48,210 --> 00:35:53,070
are criminal used today to do these a
passive attack

614
00:35:53,070 --> 00:35:56,850
find out movies putting you under
surveillance so they're about 2,000

615
00:35:56,850 --> 00:35:57,980
discrete frequencies

616
00:35:57,980 --> 00:36:02,420
their shared compote in one place the
park service might use a frequency than

617
00:36:02,420 --> 00:36:04,600
another place the FBI is using

618
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:09,460
arm so we look specifically with those
frequencies it had mostly in for good

619
00:36:09,460 --> 00:36:10,570
traffic on them

620
00:36:10,570 --> 00:36:13,580
and home we basically moon

621
00:36:13,580 --> 00:36:17,080
in Scopus in a few cities I can't tell
you what cities they are

622
00:36:17,080 --> 00:36:20,450
on them but you can use your imagination

623
00:36:20,450 --> 00:36:24,169
mom and I can tell you what agencies we
intercepted except to say it

624
00:36:24,170 --> 00:36:27,330
all them mine and I'm

625
00:36:27,330 --> 00:36:30,950
and related run for a couple years so

626
00:36:30,950 --> 00:36:34,330
13 yep there was one weird exception

627
00:36:34,330 --> 00:36:37,340
was not there is a weird exception but I
can't say yeah

628
00:36:37,340 --> 00:36:41,350
um but yeah there's an agency that you
wouldn't think governor turns out to be

629
00:36:41,350 --> 00:36:42,100
really good

630
00:36:42,100 --> 00:36:45,310
ok I'm and yeah you look

631
00:36:45,310 --> 00:36:48,779
up don't you up rebounds

632
00:36:48,780 --> 00:36:53,500
so on my view we weren't looking you
could do it out see no minimum

633
00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:59,640
%uh things as far as we know if they're
using the AES crypto model which is not

634
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:00,589
in you can purchase

635
00:37:00,590 --> 00:37:03,670
you know the bridge is dead and down
reviews the Motorola

636
00:37:03,670 --> 00:37:07,180
party Jerry crypto and doesn't afraid
recovery or broken

637
00:37:07,180 --> 00:37:10,390
on there's a paper right kind Australia
where they did a nice example

638
00:37:10,390 --> 00:37:13,620
are breaking as on that Obama using AES

639
00:37:13,620 --> 00:37:17,080
the crib is working and so we didn't
bother we didn't happen

640
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:20,250
because there now he's

641
00:37:20,250 --> 00:37:23,950
using the grid in Berkeley on and

642
00:37:23,950 --> 00:37:28,950
to find a comment that the frequencies
that we want to listen I'm you to scan

643
00:37:28,950 --> 00:37:32,120
when you look for crackdown and if you
can't understand it that the town that

644
00:37:32,120 --> 00:37:32,870
uses crypto

645
00:37:32,870 --> 00:37:38,000
Zamindar on these are her dream and a
greedy owners

646
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:41,740
I think they're selling for what about
to be on bad about them but yeah on and

647
00:37:41,740 --> 00:37:42,760
a lot cheaper now

648
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:47,600
arm you be even programmable radios are
getting to the point where they can do

649
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:48,240
this

650
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:51,400
quite well but they weren't hope for our
needs they weren't at the

651
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:54,820
on 23 years ago they didn't decried fast
enough

652
00:37:54,820 --> 00:37:59,900
for us must use them on who is also a
problem with that the Kodak decoding

653
00:37:59,900 --> 00:38:02,960
Lee which i think is fixed now yes

654
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:06,210
some remember exactly how you do it
you're going to do it today

655
00:38:06,210 --> 00:38:09,960
right even but you knew for cheaper than
we'd terms and he's even

656
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:13,410
on and what we're doing it live monitor
so

657
00:38:13,410 --> 00:38:18,160
we were picking up around 20 minutes a
day

658
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:21,720
for me to bar listening post on hand
according to what I mean man intended

659
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:22,550
target to

660
00:38:22,550 --> 00:38:26,180
but it is ending fall into three
categories: on and most the time

661
00:38:26,180 --> 00:38:29,960
on and for together as they think
they're interrupted when a are

662
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:33,140
after re publisher paper

663
00:38:33,140 --> 00:38:36,710
on a UNIX and we went in we talk to
avenge a different agencies

664
00:38:36,710 --> 00:38:40,190
an and they said yes this is a real
problem yes we've got to deal with and

665
00:38:40,190 --> 00:38:41,570
they're really really good

666
00:38:41,570 --> 00:38:44,650
we started getting 30 minutes a group
text so we're not sure

667
00:38:44,650 --> 00:38:47,880
what's going on on and

668
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:53,270
by an intentional your text on this is
pretty sensitive information

669
00:38:53,270 --> 00:38:57,630
and how sensitive information use our
imaginations

670
00:38:57,630 --> 00:39:03,170
anything that that goes on in the short
investigation any sort of operation

671
00:39:03,170 --> 00:39:08,860
dad you need to use on encryption
because you need to keep it confidential

672
00:39:08,860 --> 00:39:12,750
on that's the stuff that we're hearing
sir

673
00:39:12,750 --> 00:39:16,000
needs targets address address and

674
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:19,670
it will go in the old days when everyone
knew radio was itttt secure

675
00:39:19,670 --> 00:39:23,220
they were much more circumspect about
what they would say but you believe the

676
00:39:23,220 --> 00:39:25,070
radio is a secure channel

677
00:39:25,070 --> 00:39:28,540
than you are much more free and want you
say over

678
00:39:28,540 --> 00:39:31,960
yet we know locations in a direction
they're moving in we know what they're

679
00:39:31,960 --> 00:39:34,970
wearing we know the target there were no
with another wearing

680
00:39:34,970 --> 00:39:38,460
on other devices whether there's a
helicopter and I'll a terror

681
00:39:38,460 --> 00:39:41,590
I'm pretty much anything on

682
00:39:41,590 --> 00:39:45,270
are and this is kinda scary

683
00:39:45,270 --> 00:39:48,720
so we didn't know at first when I we
should say anything about it her

684
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:51,780
am but are lawyers to care that for us

685
00:39:51,780 --> 00:39:55,760
them and this is most most of the stuff
that we were picking up

686
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:59,090
and listening to were criminal
investigations on

687
00:39:59,090 --> 00:40:02,190
but there was some interesting national
stuff too

688
00:40:02,190 --> 00:40:07,300
and handsome parent Elgin sir

689
00:40:07,300 --> 00:40:10,570
on as we listen to it and and

690
00:40:10,570 --> 00:40:13,980
mind in this was button or the paper was
about to

691
00:40:13,980 --> 00:40:17,520
almost two and half years monitoring
this

692
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:20,660
we started building a taxonomy on it
because we want to figure out

693
00:40:20,660 --> 00:40:23,960
what was going wrong and why and who's
fault

694
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:27,440
and Peter not that that the problems
fall in in

695
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:32,190
13 categories either one person is not
pertinent

696
00:40:32,190 --> 00:40:37,920
everybody else's everybody's not pretty
but they think they're imprinted

697
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:42,510
or they can't get the encryption or to
work and we could categories is quite

698
00:40:42,510 --> 00:40:44,150
easily because if one person

699
00:40:44,150 --> 00:40:48,370
was not credited and everybody else was
you only heard one side the conversation

700
00:40:48,370 --> 00:40:51,420
you have been responding to somebody and
you wouldn't hear the rest because we

701
00:40:51,420 --> 00:40:54,080
didn't have the key so we couldn't
decode

702
00:40:54,080 --> 00:40:58,100
on everybody's in the clear we were
hearing things like

703
00:40:58,100 --> 00:41:01,150
here's how you do the encryption Turner
switch to the to them

704
00:41:01,150 --> 00:41:05,280
the ok on or we hear people which is
wrong by the way

705
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:09,420
anybody using one of these radios I'm
here people give instructions on how to

706
00:41:09,420 --> 00:41:11,360
do over the air rekeying

707
00:41:11,360 --> 00:41:15,580
are and now they say okay everybody got
the new he's great now were incurred

708
00:41:15,580 --> 00:41:19,130
so and and im arm

709
00:41:19,130 --> 00:41:22,580
and are you know 28 2013 in the day

710
00:41:22,580 --> 00:41:26,600
we're hearing about 10 minutes %uh the
first intended to the second

711
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:29,760
and no and the last and none with the
key feel your

712
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:34,500
you this particularly happened in those
regularly scheduled already wreaking

713
00:41:34,500 --> 00:41:38,490
and then what you hear is in this is a
direct quote fuck the radios go in the

714
00:41:38,490 --> 00:41:39,900
clear

715
00:41:39,900 --> 00:41:44,650
on a cell and it was pretty evenly split

716
00:41:44,650 --> 00:41:48,570
no I wanna season these people are
professionals

717
00:41:48,570 --> 00:41:52,380
they are really good at their jobs and
all the things I listen to

718
00:41:52,380 --> 00:41:56,400
I am NOT an incredible respect for them
and the work that they're doing

719
00:41:56,400 --> 00:42:00,090
but they can get these tools to work now
I

720
00:42:00,090 --> 00:42:04,500
drive a car every day I have to use it
as part of my job

721
00:42:04,500 --> 00:42:08,570
I'm not a professional mechanic but I
can drive a car safely

722
00:42:08,570 --> 00:42:12,770
you shouldn't have to be a Motorola
radio developer

723
00:42:12,770 --> 00:42:17,030
in order to be able to operate these
radios probably

724
00:42:17,030 --> 00:42:21,580
tell arm the

725
00:42:21,580 --> 00:42:27,150
the reviews are used all over every
three letter and it's been the agency

726
00:42:27,150 --> 00:42:30,610
on police departments the on

727
00:42:30,610 --> 00:42:35,270
Park Service everybody uses these they
were on

728
00:42:35,270 --> 00:42:39,009
the development of an end and the arm
adoption on them

729
00:42:39,010 --> 00:42:43,470
ones on stand-up specifically after 9/11
in order to get

730
00:42:43,470 --> 00:42:47,820
agencies to be able to communicate with
each other per from quickly easily

731
00:42:47,820 --> 00:42:51,870
and how they needed the Red Cross uses
these on

732
00:42:51,870 --> 00:42:56,440
but they can't use them effectively on

733
00:42:56,440 --> 00:43:00,670
the we shouldn't be hearing things that
we're hearing we shouldn't be hearing me

734
00:43:00,670 --> 00:43:06,270
them no matter where we are in the
country comp and we are here

735
00:43:06,270 --> 00:43:10,000
and on on the two cousins

736
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:13,220
wanted them is

737
00:43:13,220 --> 00:43:18,720
unfixable really the King failure it is
is not a usable in Ramadan user issue

738
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:22,400
on and there's not there's

739
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:26,430
be jamming problem is on usability
problem it's not a user issue

740
00:43:26,430 --> 00:43:28,759
on those are things that we're going to
have to go back to the system and

741
00:43:28,760 --> 00:43:31,190
redesign from scratch in order to fix

742
00:43:31,190 --> 00:43:34,200
the accident to clear text

743
00:43:34,200 --> 00:43:38,330
armen is part user party usability

744
00:43:38,330 --> 00:43:43,029
on the design in the Rio's such and as
president is hard to remember what this

745
00:43:43,030 --> 00:43:44,890
does if you don't use it frequently

746
00:43:44,890 --> 00:43:48,759
the radios every single button switch on
this is programmable

747
00:43:48,760 --> 00:43:52,140
most in the buttons and switches are
overloading there there are little

748
00:43:52,140 --> 00:43:55,470
flashing lights for example that will
tell you may be reprinted maybe you're

749
00:43:55,470 --> 00:43:57,970
not the flashing light of a mean
something else

750
00:43:57,970 --> 00:44:00,790
there's little beep that will tell you
if you're good maybe not but that also

751
00:44:00,790 --> 00:44:02,160
has another use

752
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:06,680
and and so there is so incredibly
complicated that

753
00:44:06,680 --> 00:44:11,700
its almost impossible to use read it
correctly at the right time

754
00:44:11,700 --> 00:44:15,260
and I are good but that's not a loser
problem and even if it were use a

755
00:44:15,260 --> 00:44:16,650
problem I'd argue that we

756
00:44:16,650 --> 00:44:20,200
can't fix the user's so you have to fix
the usability

757
00:44:20,200 --> 00:44:23,770
on I know anything of that matter

758
00:44:23,770 --> 00:44:27,730
so I'm a response bennett thank goodness
it

759
00:44:27,730 --> 00:44:32,570
rem before we um published this we
wanted to help

760
00:44:32,570 --> 00:44:35,970
the users are theirs um you know

761
00:44:35,970 --> 00:44:39,530
fix the problems we worried that you
know as a result of publishing

762
00:44:39,530 --> 00:44:43,680
on which we have to do are correct them
we publish findings were required by our

763
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:45,330
funding agencies to do that

764
00:44:45,330 --> 00:44:49,740
but we didn't actually want to I'm you
know cause harm in one of the things we

765
00:44:49,740 --> 00:44:51,090
were worried about was that

766
00:44:51,090 --> 00:44:55,060
go in pointing out this problem we'll be
encouraging actual criminals in real bad

767
00:44:55,060 --> 00:44:56,040
people that

768
00:44:56,040 --> 00:44:59,790
you know do belong lock up to go do
better

769
00:44:59,790 --> 00:45:02,950
counter surveillance I'm and so we

770
00:45:02,950 --> 00:45:06,750
I'm you be you well in advance of
publication

771
00:45:06,750 --> 00:45:10,880
very politely approach the a federal
government

772
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:13,860
and gun pointed out some problems and
we're a little bit worried that they

773
00:45:13,860 --> 00:45:16,850
would decide that we were the problem
rather than the year

774
00:45:16,850 --> 00:45:21,520
radios but it turned up Bay there it was
extremely well received the people in me

775
00:45:21,520 --> 00:45:25,350
on federal agencies responsible for
securing it turns out

776
00:45:25,350 --> 00:45:29,890
are just like us they understand that
beyond discovering a problem is not the

777
00:45:29,890 --> 00:45:31,879
same as causing a problem

778
00:45:31,880 --> 00:45:34,940
and so you usually we we're going

779
00:45:34,940 --> 00:45:38,590
incursion but backer we're talking to
people who really wanted to work

780
00:45:38,590 --> 00:45:41,870
with us to develop mitigations

781
00:45:41,870 --> 00:45:44,779
when you know we we made a bunch of
suggestions which we don't really have

782
00:45:44,780 --> 00:45:46,180
time to go in

783
00:45:46,180 --> 00:45:49,750
I'm to hear a short term things you can
do to mitigate

784
00:45:49,750 --> 00:45:54,450
the passive attacks the activity tax
room will require a portable redesign

785
00:45:54,450 --> 00:45:57,520
but the path attacks which are the real
immediate threat

786
00:45:57,520 --> 00:46:00,650
arm you know we we

787
00:46:00,650 --> 00:46:03,910
there are some things that you can do so
the first thing is that

788
00:46:03,910 --> 00:46:08,759
I'm million they didn't kill prior
arrests cost her anything crazy like bad

789
00:46:08,760 --> 00:46:12,600
on but we capped are statistics
gathering about how much

790
00:46:12,600 --> 00:46:16,750
will text is going on and arm what we
found was that

791
00:46:16,750 --> 00:46:20,910
up for about a week after we talked
again giving agency

792
00:46:20,910 --> 00:46:25,200
you know cities that we were monitoring
the amount or accidental text would go

793
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:26,420
down an embankment

794
00:46:26,420 --> 00:46:30,490
capture audio things like everybody you
gotta pay more attention to switch to

795
00:46:30,490 --> 00:46:30,900
the

796
00:46:30,900 --> 00:46:35,380
per bid mode arm you know the and so
we're going okay great maybe they're

797
00:46:35,380 --> 00:46:35,940
getting it

798
00:46:35,940 --> 00:46:40,260
but then it would gramm back up and then
it would exceed where it was before so

799
00:46:40,260 --> 00:46:43,110
we went from about 20 minutes a
sensitive per text

800
00:46:43,110 --> 00:46:46,220
to about 30 minutes um within about a
month

801
00:46:46,220 --> 00:46:50,060
after talking to any given agency but it
seems that the active paying attention

802
00:46:50,060 --> 00:46:51,130
to the problem

803
00:46:51,130 --> 00:46:55,940
makes it worse on and we don't we don't
know why managing director

804
00:46:55,940 --> 00:46:59,100
why that might be one reason it might
that it might be a good

805
00:46:59,100 --> 00:47:02,410
you know you realize that you have to do
something but you don't remember what it

806
00:47:02,410 --> 00:47:03,109
use

807
00:47:03,110 --> 00:47:06,880
after a while and you fiddle with the
switch more of it or something

808
00:47:06,880 --> 00:47:10,290
something along those lines but there's
some very interesting arm

809
00:47:10,290 --> 00:47:13,580
user usability and user experience
phenomenon going on it

810
00:47:13,580 --> 00:47:16,680
that's perfect for on we also

811
00:47:16,680 --> 00:47:19,720
our talk to be arm

812
00:47:19,720 --> 00:47:24,210
I talk the standards and vendor
community

813
00:47:24,210 --> 00:47:27,770
arm which was not nearly as as well
behaved a

814
00:47:27,770 --> 00:47:31,390
federal government returned I did you
get your poem your finger in the 900

815
00:47:31,390 --> 00:47:34,430
choices are doing it to like federal law
enforcement agencies

816
00:47:34,430 --> 00:47:39,629
or standards bodies be the federal law
enforcement agency will be much more

817
00:47:39,630 --> 00:47:44,150
respect receptive to you I'm so back
right in the voting machine

818
00:47:44,150 --> 00:47:47,190
research which showed we talked about it
hope I've made about

819
00:47:47,190 --> 00:47:51,190
security excuse bingo for the responses
from different vendors

820
00:47:51,190 --> 00:47:54,910
you know im responders like no you're
just talking be a radical mumbo jumbo

821
00:47:54,910 --> 00:47:56,069
loan

822
00:47:56,070 --> 00:48:00,359
over we already knew about it or you're
just academics you don't understand real

823
00:48:00,359 --> 00:48:01,509
security years

824
00:48:01,510 --> 00:48:05,120
you know hey we are proprietary
information over who's prevent this

825
00:48:05,120 --> 00:48:09,580
the perverted thing from happening and
we take security very seriously

826
00:48:09,580 --> 00:48:12,890
which actually means we did don't take
security very seriously

827
00:48:12,890 --> 00:48:17,759
I'm and hidden clues on my website you
can just put on getting more tea time

828
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:23,150
so it turns out that the vendors up the
p25 radio thing to use this as their

829
00:48:23,150 --> 00:48:28,570
script generator for responses on the we
we got things like will you guys aren't

830
00:48:28,570 --> 00:48:32,800
radio engineers you don't understand
decibels Tom hamburger

831
00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:38,080
the um in I am a frequent problem
response I think you've got a response

832
00:48:38,080 --> 00:48:39,779
from a vendor we won't name

833
00:48:39,780 --> 00:48:43,230
%uh because we're polite people arm the
but

834
00:48:43,230 --> 00:48:48,100
a the where they said to you on well the
businessman from the radio that the

835
00:48:48,100 --> 00:48:49,770
problem with our users

836
00:48:49,770 --> 00:48:53,210
so yeah I'm a the problem with our User

837
00:48:53,210 --> 00:48:56,660
so you know and that makes me wonder so
you're actually saying that your users

838
00:48:56,660 --> 00:48:58,879
are too stupid to use your products

839
00:48:58,880 --> 00:49:03,120
a.m. that's an interesting arm it's a
good marketing strategy marketing

840
00:49:03,120 --> 00:49:04,150
strategy got

841
00:49:04,150 --> 00:49:07,220
on the year on

842
00:49:07,220 --> 00:49:10,460
so good you have this appears to be an
on

843
00:49:10,460 --> 00:49:14,840
you're busy fixing the standard appears
to be a much more difficult

844
00:49:14,840 --> 00:49:19,080
and and long-term process the meantime
we have communications

845
00:49:19,080 --> 00:49:22,500
that we suggested arm you know you

846
00:49:22,500 --> 00:49:26,120
we don't want to go over them here are
but you there are

847
00:49:26,120 --> 00:49:29,290
you know things like don't reedy more
frequently on

848
00:49:29,290 --> 00:49:32,570
configure the radio there there are ways
to force

849
00:49:32,570 --> 00:49:37,480
the radios to be configured in a kind of
non-standard way

850
00:49:37,480 --> 00:49:41,430
that prevents clear from in for
operating with encryption

851
00:49:41,430 --> 00:49:45,680
arm Ian are in the way that they they
normally do that leads to these

852
00:49:45,680 --> 00:49:48,339
usability bill using a new little bit
better be back

853
00:49:48,340 --> 00:49:52,109
but it's not obvious how to do it back
to suggestions about how to do it

854
00:49:52,109 --> 00:49:55,340
so many have you have be 25 has been
burning urge you to go to

855
00:49:55,340 --> 00:49:58,650
www production sounds like 25 getting

856
00:49:58,650 --> 00:50:02,530
arm some are medication arm strategies
there

857
00:50:02,530 --> 00:50:06,410
I think with that we have maybe four and
a half minutes tougher questions

858
00:50:06,410 --> 00:50:10,040
like and go to the microphone tell mama

859
00:50:10,040 --> 00:50:13,650
wanna problems with communication so is
any requires that you do it in it on

860
00:50:13,650 --> 00:50:15,180
each individual radio

861
00:50:15,180 --> 00:50:18,660
and this can't be done om r-mass

862
00:50:18,660 --> 00:50:22,440
which means that back for some groups
height one particular one we talked it

863
00:50:22,440 --> 00:50:24,020
had 15,000 really awesome

864
00:50:24,020 --> 00:50:28,460
on one area don't have to do it every
single re

865
00:50:28,460 --> 00:50:32,670
so I can see anyone but there's someone
at the microphone jerry is for dinner

866
00:50:32,670 --> 00:50:36,010
where the MoMA so you mention so

867
00:50:36,010 --> 00:50:39,160
you double the schools offer to all this
traffic analysis

868
00:50:39,160 --> 00:50:43,850
um are there soccer releases this can
leave user new new radio

869
00:50:43,850 --> 00:50:47,680
ago dollar dongles %uh so we went well
again we we're using

870
00:50:47,680 --> 00:50:50,990
software control radios not be SBR
platforms because

871
00:50:50,990 --> 00:50:54,410
when we started developing that was what
would work on

872
00:50:54,410 --> 00:50:57,830
we've not yet released our are

873
00:50:57,830 --> 00:51:00,870
our version of the software to control
the icons but we are

874
00:51:00,870 --> 00:51:03,839
absolutely planning on doing it we're
not releasing you get because we're to

875
00:51:03,840 --> 00:51:05,200
embarrass current

876
00:51:05,200 --> 00:51:08,390
right now and get some gonna cry baby I

877
00:51:08,390 --> 00:51:11,540
dog playing Harry but we are planning on

878
00:51:11,540 --> 00:51:14,930
up we are fighting back on I'm tearing
up what we're not gonna share

879
00:51:14,930 --> 00:51:18,930
and actually RRB requirement to prevent
us from sharing and what has been an odd

880
00:51:18,930 --> 00:51:19,950
situation

881
00:51:19,950 --> 00:51:23,560
is any of the data we've actually
collected on and you don't wear be

882
00:51:23,560 --> 00:51:24,230
banned

883
00:51:24,230 --> 00:51:28,420
if we didn't find out that somebody's
going out in the clear

884
00:51:28,420 --> 00:51:32,260
rec league prohibited by our our
university army rules

885
00:51:32,260 --> 00:51:35,440
from coming that agency about a specific
region

886
00:51:35,440 --> 00:51:39,600
arm making a mistake because they might
be punished and we're not allowed to do

887
00:51:39,600 --> 00:51:41,160
things that might harm

888
00:51:41,160 --> 00:51:45,960
and user real room we're in a very
difficult situation with data

889
00:51:45,960 --> 00:51:49,820
and we'll come on give you the
frequencies clubs represented by

890
00:51:49,820 --> 00:51:53,050
again ok

891
00:51:53,050 --> 00:51:57,220
i'm new to this but he said the design
concept of a session

892
00:51:57,220 --> 00:52:00,560
with these radios but then you want to
said that you could be paying

893
00:52:00,560 --> 00:52:04,290
in the Wii U controller I would was born
prices at running home

894
00:52:04,290 --> 00:52:07,560
yeah I heard that bear no questions with
the boys service but there's a data

895
00:52:07,560 --> 00:52:09,370
service that drugs accessions

896
00:52:09,370 --> 00:52:12,529
and isn't like a one to one thing was
the guy that made her to the one BG

897
00:52:12,530 --> 00:52:13,310
diffusion

898
00:52:13,310 --> 00:52:17,089
the data service has interesting
features like it will

899
00:52:17,089 --> 00:52:21,220
like it will reply request to retransmit
signals for packets in certain

900
00:52:21,220 --> 00:52:24,790
circumstances there's actually I think
there's a bit you set saying whether or

901
00:52:24,790 --> 00:52:25,570
not

902
00:52:25,570 --> 00:52:29,400
the date is supposed to be reliably
transmitted

903
00:52:29,400 --> 00:52:32,710
it's not get it's not interesting unless
