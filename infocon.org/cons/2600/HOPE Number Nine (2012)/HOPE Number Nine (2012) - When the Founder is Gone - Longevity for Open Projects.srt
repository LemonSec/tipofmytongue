event okay

48
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:33,940
let's transition I now that I've emceed
myself

49
00:02:33,940 --> 00:02:37,900
let's transition to the actual talk this
is called when the founder's gone

50
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:41,050
longevity for open projects and I have a

51
00:02:41,050 --> 00:02:44,519
Tom a little bit an outline I might as
well mention it and I

52
00:02:44,519 --> 00:02:48,769
that I have the abstract for a full
disclosure are the outline is that we're

53
00:02:48,769 --> 00:02:52,519
going to focus on our open technology
oriented projects for the types of open

54
00:02:52,519 --> 00:02:54,709
source project open kind and projects

55
00:02:54,709 --> 00:02:57,830
and sometimes are some fuzzy lines some
commercial

56
00:02:57,830 --> 00:03:01,300
are oriented projects may or may not
serve Paul why but I think most of us

57
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:03,319
know I generally what I'm talking about

58
00:03:03,319 --> 00:03:06,720
and rather than listing any of them or
even less thing any of the leaders claim

59
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:07,489
really talking about

60
00:03:07,489 --> 00:03:12,120
leaders these projects argument rely on
you to have a picture in your own mind

61
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:16,080
organizations that you're involved with
and I the extent to which we're going to

62
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:16,810
talk about

63
00:03:16,810 --> 00:03:21,090
applies to our might apply to us on
those projects you're involved with the

64
00:03:21,090 --> 00:03:21,810
care about

65
00:03:21,810 --> 00:03:24,970
or possibly that you're thinking someday
you might like to

66
00:03:24,970 --> 00:03:28,599
to start be in charge up arm

67
00:03:28,599 --> 00:03:31,890
the character a second to sort about the
thesis I guess if you will

68
00:03:31,890 --> 00:03:36,310
is that many of these projects are
reliant upon a visionary leader

69
00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:41,280
I founder a person that was a whole lot
of effort and we'll come back that topic

70
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:44,930
but the idea the inspiration is that our
leaders

71
00:03:44,930 --> 00:03:48,870
I can be lost in various situations they
can now it's really and I

72
00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:51,959
they can also I you lose their job loser
funding

73
00:03:51,959 --> 00:03:55,140
decide to devote more time to their
family in all the side to things

74
00:03:55,140 --> 00:03:58,709
they remove people from action active
leadership and so the question is are

75
00:03:58,709 --> 00:03:59,970
there techniques to mitigate

76
00:03:59,970 --> 00:04:03,939
about the risks losing a leader and I am
something that all

77
00:04:03,939 --> 00:04:07,540
also to introduce I want well on a lot
is that the

78
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:11,000
characteristics are the leaders in the
characteristics in the projects

79
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,890
might actually be self-limiting I
believe in some cases they are

80
00:04:14,890 --> 00:04:19,389
in other words that on maybe it doesn't
necessarily get done but a lot of times

81
00:04:19,389 --> 00:04:21,040
projects run their own

82
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:25,810
course their own natural life cycle and
of course life cycles very quite a lot

83
00:04:25,810 --> 00:04:29,699
a run their own life cycle and
eventually arm are you know whatever

84
00:04:29,699 --> 00:04:32,500
that whatever happens that the way to
get clothes they finish they call it

85
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:33,639
done they give up

86
00:04:33,639 --> 00:04:36,680
are they get subsumed with another
project yet something like this

87
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:42,020
but there's a out life cycle that that
makes me think that sometimes longevity

88
00:04:42,020 --> 00:04:44,359
for some other projects that were aware
of and I said

89
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:48,150
you'll have won a reminder of your mind
right now arm

90
00:04:48,150 --> 00:04:51,680
might not even be possible maybe maybe
not be desirable

91
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:55,340
might not be possible in the
multi-decade all environment

92
00:04:55,340 --> 00:04:58,960
I just paste in the abstract no: is too
small to read but all I'll get the slide

93
00:04:58,960 --> 00:04:59,799
up on my

94
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:03,090
on my webpage petascale .org I fly to be
to

95
00:05:03,090 --> 00:05:06,570
dot HTML willing to this later on today
or tomorrow

96
00:05:06,570 --> 00:05:11,030
arm and also want to mention that they
gave a talk at the

97
00:05:11,030 --> 00:05:15,190
Chaos Computer camp last summer II don't
matter to many people in the room here

98
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:17,110
that we're at that talk but Dom

99
00:05:17,110 --> 00:05:21,530
I the youths lights that talk or are
online and the titles as you see here is

100
00:05:21,530 --> 00:05:22,910
our building and getting way

101
00:05:22,910 --> 00:05:27,240
motivations and the the reason why I
came up with that talks is sorta I

102
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:28,430
personally motivated

103
00:05:28,430 --> 00:05:31,539
there and I was personally motivated as
a stock was

104
00:05:31,539 --> 00:05:35,020
are essential as reflecting on a little
bit what I was talking about

105
00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:38,590
earlier which is that there are these
projects and

106
00:05:38,590 --> 00:05:43,310
they rely upon leadership at some store
they rely upon contributions activity

107
00:05:43,310 --> 00:05:47,500
have may be a very large corpus relief
corps love often volunteers usually

108
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:48,530
volunteers

109
00:05:48,530 --> 00:05:52,180
are some people get paid me by the
workplace maybe by the project

110
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:56,759
but us or to volunteer type thing and so
that the major observation hears that

111
00:05:56,759 --> 00:06:00,110
people do love dove on here we see so
many people putting in so much

112
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:03,580
effort to these great project in a lot
of them course are

113
00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:07,270
are at this than here today are both the
leaders and the

114
00:06:07,270 --> 00:06:10,849
contributors our three contributor
leaders sometimes

115
00:06:10,850 --> 00:06:14,740
arm and one of the main takeaway points
there is that people do love to

116
00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:15,539
volunteer

117
00:06:15,539 --> 00:06:19,310
but what motivates them to volunteer
might not actually be agreement with the

118
00:06:19,310 --> 00:06:21,289
perceptions of the leader

119
00:06:21,289 --> 00:06:25,520
it might instead be are something else
for example a an alignment with the

120
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:26,560
outcomes

121
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:29,979
up the project you can see the notes for
that online I think I think I'm pretty

122
00:06:29,979 --> 00:06:32,818
sure they stream that have actually seen
the encoded video but I think there's

123
00:06:32,819 --> 00:06:34,039
video out there

124
00:06:34,039 --> 00:06:37,639
arm as well on that talk so wanna give
that as a background

125
00:06:37,639 --> 00:06:40,250
and as I mentioned I have a personal
motivation here as many have you know

126
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:41,259
I'm by Mar

127
00:06:41,259 --> 00:06:45,069
involve project gutenberg: and I have my
little blurb in there

128
00:06:45,069 --> 00:06:49,220
and %uh michael Hart died just a little
less than a year ago so last september

129
00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:52,690
sex and on so we had a transition plan

130
00:06:52,690 --> 00:06:57,509
and unfortunately transition plan is me
so I'm thinking a lot about

131
00:06:57,509 --> 00:07:01,370
I the practical aspects of what's next
you know what happens what happens when

132
00:07:01,370 --> 00:07:04,069
the founder is gone and when the project
is not

133
00:07:04,069 --> 00:07:08,229
yet done there's a lot of lot of work
left to do arm

134
00:07:08,229 --> 00:07:11,650
so I'll come back to a few that you the
characteristics have been Bergen we're

135
00:07:11,650 --> 00:07:12,190
not gonna

136
00:07:12,190 --> 00:07:16,500
I'm not gonna I dwell on that too much
as a arm as an exemplar

137
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:20,400
other than from so my own personal on
serb anecdotes and things like that

138
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:24,729
but are but I will mention

139
00:07:24,729 --> 00:07:29,150
early on here on the slide that dog
gutenberg is one of the very early

140
00:07:29,150 --> 00:07:31,099
projects and certainly one of the

141
00:07:31,099 --> 00:07:35,310
are these open projects at that you now
have several are probably in your mind

142
00:07:35,310 --> 00:07:38,650
I it's really wanted a very very
earliest ones and us

143
00:07:38,650 --> 00:07:42,690
are dollars very very early ones on
almost definitely

144
00:07:42,690 --> 00:07:47,030
with at least if not be but it's really
one of the ones with the most longevity

145
00:07:47,030 --> 00:07:51,310
on so Michael essentially devoted his
whole active career

146
00:07:51,310 --> 00:07:54,710
from the early seventies and then by the
mid eighties

147
00:07:54,710 --> 00:07:58,250
I answered a variety things he was doing
for the early seventies to the

148
00:07:58,250 --> 00:08:01,560
mid-eighties eyes involved with high by
a lot of

149
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:05,039
our time without bicycles things like
that as I sorta

150
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:08,919
on various types have enterprise use
involved with but from the actual

151
00:08:08,919 --> 00:08:12,620
founding the greater the electronic book
back in 71

152
00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:16,750
arm and then full-time starting in the
mid eighties

153
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:20,819
I he was a project gutenberg: ice we put
in many tens of thousands

154
00:08:20,819 --> 00:08:25,830
hours are maintaining things arm and
this is not a typical that's really the

155
00:08:25,830 --> 00:08:27,699
point I mean longevity the

156
00:08:27,699 --> 00:08:30,990
the early engagement is unusual and

157
00:08:30,990 --> 00:08:34,279
arm I stand out however the idea doubt

158
00:08:34,279 --> 00:08:37,330
that a person comes along has a great
idea are

159
00:08:37,330 --> 00:08:41,589
forms a little bit think that how it can
are you know take him and take the

160
00:08:41,589 --> 00:08:45,000
goals hammer and take the goals of this
project into the future

161
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,230
maybe change the world different types
motivations at a leader has

162
00:08:48,230 --> 00:08:53,170
arm in is pretty common when you look at
these projects is pretty common to find

163
00:08:53,170 --> 00:08:54,709
there's a single leader

164
00:08:54,709 --> 00:08:58,830
that I came up with the idea put in lots
and lots a time

165
00:08:58,830 --> 00:09:02,580
I sometimes paid sometimes unpaid
sometime then organization sometimes

166
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:04,279
before there's an organization

167
00:09:04,279 --> 00:09:07,209
I know a lot of pride in how that
actually occurs are some books and

168
00:09:07,209 --> 00:09:07,760
theses

169
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:11,550
that people have written on that that
aspect these open projects

170
00:09:11,550 --> 00:09:14,940
on but it's not uncommon for people to
really spend their arm

171
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:19,290
are you there more than free time warren
in some cases

172
00:09:19,290 --> 00:09:23,449
as with Michael the whole entire career
I engaged in doing what they

173
00:09:23,450 --> 00:09:27,000
where they believe in what they're
motivated by arm

174
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,660
so anyway with a case a good burger
cause for a long long-term

175
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:35,750
our engagement with our Michael I was
involved since 1991 and 2001

176
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:39,149
are part of this transition plan that
Michael was very big time was

177
00:09:39,149 --> 00:09:42,330
arm to form this is really an assess the
actually that

178
00:09:42,330 --> 00:09:45,890
I took a while to convince him up but
the form an actual %ah corporate

179
00:09:45,890 --> 00:09:46,640
structure

180
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:49,899
because people are donating money was
within the much of

181
00:09:49,899 --> 00:09:54,330
but on are making very safe donations
and he wanted to be able to have some

182
00:09:54,330 --> 00:09:55,420
sort of our

183
00:09:55,420 --> 00:10:00,189
employment they came from from his role
and ride a bus or a structural boring

184
00:10:00,190 --> 00:10:04,310
legalistic type reasons but about we
formed a foundation reporter foundation

185
00:10:04,310 --> 00:10:06,130
I became the director and CEO

186
00:10:06,130 --> 00:10:09,700
that foundation that's been my role
since since 2001

187
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:13,100
are present all before then so arms this
is actually pretty good

188
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:16,600
I would say in turns out are the
long-range planning

189
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:20,899
I wouldn't necessarily claim that the
gutenberg story and my current role

190
00:10:20,899 --> 00:10:24,190
is exemplary in terms of an effective
transition check with me and maybe

191
00:10:24,190 --> 00:10:25,290
you're too

192
00:10:25,290 --> 00:10:28,579
and I'll let you know and on my way that

193
00:10:28,579 --> 00:10:32,329
picture go back here that picture was
taken right over there same clothing

194
00:10:32,329 --> 00:10:34,540
when Michael gave the keynote at home
number six

195
00:10:34,540 --> 00:10:38,959
back and I'm sorry to bug the hell
rather in a 2006

196
00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:43,070
you can see our real name badges so you
may remember with the prisoner

197
00:10:43,070 --> 00:10:48,040
and Michael of course had to across out
whatever number he got his

198
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:51,719
Iran had there we have a number you get
on on his dad had to cross out for

199
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:52,709
number one

200
00:10:52,709 --> 00:10:56,240
as is our is his number right so on

201
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:59,640
let's talk a little bit about how
leadership tends to function and but

202
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:03,449
I should mention by the way on if people
wanna interrupt I don't I don't mind

203
00:11:03,450 --> 00:11:07,279
eyes are laid out their profits and I'll
go and as as the outline settle talk a

204
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:10,329
little bit leadership a little bit about
what motivates volunteers

205
00:11:10,329 --> 00:11:13,709
little bit about how we can mitigate
some the risk of loss a leader

206
00:11:13,709 --> 00:11:17,390
I like you like to make a comment step
up to the microphone on

207
00:11:17,390 --> 00:11:20,839
and I'm happy to be interrupted the arm

208
00:11:20,839 --> 00:11:24,149
yelling out of comments from the
audience is OK and try to remember to

209
00:11:24,149 --> 00:11:25,269
repeat it back but

210
00:11:25,269 --> 00:11:28,360
job but he stepped up to the mike you
know you're there and also the

211
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:32,480
are the people pick up what you where
you at about

212
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:35,750
so on the topic leadership

213
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:39,430
the arm

214
00:11:39,430 --> 00:11:43,230
the thing that tends to happen and again
you already have at least had some ideas

215
00:11:43,230 --> 00:11:46,790
about some these projects in your own
mind about Plano some details

216
00:11:46,790 --> 00:11:49,800
that might not fit this this particular
I description

217
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:53,149
but think that tends to happen is that
project as I said are

218
00:11:53,149 --> 00:11:58,339
very often many the ones I can think up
are not formed really pretty well all of

219
00:11:58,339 --> 00:12:00,920
them but not formed by some committee
some group

220
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:04,670
you know getting to go now the effective
ones mean be with

221
00:12:04,670 --> 00:12:07,939
few exceptions they're not formed by a
bunch of people sitting around saying

222
00:12:07,940 --> 00:12:09,829
what stream up way of changing world

223
00:12:09,829 --> 00:12:12,940
their formed by out visionary leader
that

224
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:17,139
I not only has the idea but also devotes
the time

225
00:12:17,139 --> 00:12:21,209
the energy over off in a peer reviewers
before anyone else the everyman

226
00:12:21,209 --> 00:12:25,160
hurt a bit to you are to their passion
to what they they think is going to be

227
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:26,199
on

228
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:29,660
are a way of achieving their goals which
often

229
00:12:29,660 --> 00:12:33,430
involved things like change in the world
actual evidence item that changed the

230
00:12:33,430 --> 00:12:35,839
world and and and making noms

231
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:40,430
are some improvements so here's the
thing

232
00:12:40,430 --> 00:12:44,220
the yeah I have another slide that goes
into a little bit i det on as well

233
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:47,300
but the people that are the leaders
visionary

234
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:52,750
folks the founders are not necessarily
that well suited

235
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:56,020
to running an organization that is

236
00:12:56,020 --> 00:13:00,110
probably necessary as as this project
rose and again I think we see you can

237
00:13:00,110 --> 00:13:03,490
think it's an example 0 mine I think we
see a lot of examples where this

238
00:13:03,490 --> 00:13:07,640
software that tends to happen and so we
have a visionary a founder

239
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:11,890
who is the thought leader that may be
giving some level direction and was able

240
00:13:11,890 --> 00:13:14,980
in some early days a spell out where
things were going to be headed

241
00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:18,600
and I talk to a lot of people that love
individual arm

242
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:23,270
evangelism AB's by email or something
like that happened of its a face to face

243
00:13:23,270 --> 00:13:28,550
situation and arm so they're they're in
this thought leader

244
00:13:28,550 --> 00:13:32,589
role on but the organization

245
00:13:32,589 --> 00:13:36,310
that surrounds the project is
essentially something like a meritocracy

246
00:13:36,310 --> 00:13:37,110
based

247
00:13:37,110 --> 00:13:41,089
hierarchy are so you know you have an
organizational chart with a whatever it

248
00:13:41,089 --> 00:13:44,920
is maybe the Board of Directors may be
CEO maybe steering committee

249
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:48,260
maybe there's another with other word
for it are maybe you don't have

250
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:49,569
democracy you have

251
00:13:49,570 --> 00:13:53,950
farm are a you know on some sort of
consensus driven

252
00:13:53,950 --> 00:13:57,110
organization arm but whatever it is our
subs are organising

253
00:13:57,110 --> 00:14:00,700
organizational structure and the
founders usually

254
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:04,470
I don't usually is quite the right word
in many cases are not necessarily well

255
00:14:04,470 --> 00:14:06,760
suited to setting that up for operating

256
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:11,100
are within a and I will talk about that
arm

257
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:15,640
but even if they're not last point here
is that the leader's role

258
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:20,199
is still the sort a thought leader our
project and I giving the overall guide

259
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:24,180
they started at right there it was their
idea and other people signed signed on

260
00:14:24,180 --> 00:14:28,430
in some way Tribune effort in some way
so the are the leaders role is something

261
00:14:28,430 --> 00:14:29,740
that is on

262
00:14:29,740 --> 00:14:34,740
often crucial for keeping the product
active keeping volunteers

263
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:38,579
engage making maybe a variety of
decisions and yet

264
00:14:38,579 --> 00:14:42,149
arm the fit out this

265
00:14:42,149 --> 00:14:45,990
leader within the hierarchy that comes
out is something that i think is pretty

266
00:14:45,990 --> 00:14:46,620
variable

267
00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:49,829
there's a lot of different are different
roles

268
00:14:49,829 --> 00:14:53,209
so I had to I had the opportunity to
read a recent done

269
00:14:53,209 --> 00:14:57,040
are article in The Nation magazine i
think is based on a whole book a

270
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:59,099
representation by actress for Hayes

271
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:04,250
and down I just that does anything up
that I sucked into my talk here

272
00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:08,150
the idea is that meritocracy sometimes
are doomed to become oligarchies

273
00:15:08,150 --> 00:15:12,150
and I and II I was gonna say rather
oligarchy I was going to say

274
00:15:12,150 --> 00:15:15,390
our rephrasing this I talk about Tom

275
00:15:15,390 --> 00:15:19,170
benefits and monarchies essentially
where you have

276
00:15:19,170 --> 00:15:23,240
the founder and some role and the
founders ensley has the ability to

277
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:27,839
arm I say yes or no on just about
anything and usually be followed

278
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:29,810
sometimes the question be usually be
followed

279
00:15:29,810 --> 00:15:34,430
and that essentially is a parallel
decision-making structure to the formal

280
00:15:34,430 --> 00:15:35,420
organization

281
00:15:35,420 --> 00:15:38,660
so we have a like I said we're in
tractors you have I

282
00:15:38,660 --> 00:15:43,130
you know various manager managerial
types are rollin summit larger projects

283
00:15:43,130 --> 00:15:47,910
arm you have in a open source product
you have code commuters people in charge

284
00:15:47,910 --> 00:15:48,660
a bug

285
00:15:48,660 --> 00:15:51,680
main and celery or things that most of
us are familiar with

286
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:56,300
arm the ER the person in charge is often

287
00:15:56,300 --> 00:16:00,740
like I said not necessarily part of that
sort of farm more democratic more

288
00:16:00,740 --> 00:16:04,000
AmeriCredit structure but instead the

289
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,040
you know all the darker the on Corp are
they

290
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:10,860
oligarchy structure so I want to mention
that you can read the articles in The

291
00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:13,640
Nation magazine few weeks ago and as I
said I think there's a job

292
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:17,970
the whole book that's out on that on and
that the takeaway here was really goes

293
00:16:17,970 --> 00:16:20,150
back to what I mentioned earlier about
leadership

294
00:16:20,150 --> 00:16:24,459
roles styles motivation and so forth and
I have a slight on this is actually

295
00:16:24,459 --> 00:16:25,900
copied onto my CCC

296
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:32,790
talk last year is that by definition the
people that are these visionary founder

297
00:16:32,790 --> 00:16:37,550
people that become the leaders have
become the ER the inspiration for all

298
00:16:37,550 --> 00:16:39,370
the volunteers all the activity

299
00:16:39,370 --> 00:16:43,390
that had their name on the whatever it
is you on the web site or on

300
00:16:43,390 --> 00:16:46,850
I that that's the go to for media that
people want to talk to you

301
00:16:46,850 --> 00:16:52,339
I V spoke by definition are thinking
outside the box

302
00:16:52,339 --> 00:16:57,319
there trying to be disruptive of it
intentionally they're trying to arm

303
00:16:57,319 --> 00:17:02,610
I I had a slight thing on its this crash
early or they're trying to change the

304
00:17:02,610 --> 00:17:03,150
world

305
00:17:03,150 --> 00:17:07,250
trying to improve society they're trying
to save the children who knows all these

306
00:17:07,250 --> 00:17:08,990
different motivations that people have

307
00:17:08,990 --> 00:17:13,349
but they're trying to do that by our
babies varying levels a radical mess but

308
00:17:13,349 --> 00:17:13,869
by

309
00:17:13,870 --> 00:17:17,220
by effecting change by by coming along
with a

310
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:21,740
different better way of doing things and
does is a great quote from George

311
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:22,459
Bernard Shaw

312
00:17:22,459 --> 00:17:25,150
and I found out by the way those you
that our fans that is actually

313
00:17:25,150 --> 00:17:27,750
variations on this quotes in different
Dr

314
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:31,040
different books it turned out that dime
AB speeches as well

315
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:34,760
it turns out there one bring people like
Shaw have great ideas

316
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:38,250
they often repeat themselves are with
variation over a

317
00:17:38,250 --> 00:17:42,780
overtime by the at the quote I i down
here is that the reasonable people adapt

318
00:17:42,780 --> 00:17:44,210
themselves to the world

319
00:17:44,210 --> 00:17:48,210
on reasonable people attempt to adapt
the world to themselves

320
00:17:48,210 --> 00:17:51,390
all progress therefore depends upon

321
00:17:51,390 --> 00:17:54,640
unreasonable people being unreasonable

322
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:59,360
on is my my comment here often means
that your face with social pressure

323
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:02,600
and if you're on reasonable in
elementary school

324
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:06,000
I these days you might find yourself on
arm

325
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,040
argued on some sort of drug and I no

326
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:12,418
that you're on reasonableness is
mitigated by the organizational

327
00:18:12,419 --> 00:18:14,300
structure in the school you're part of

328
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:18,230
are maybe in olden days wasn't quite the
same but there's still a social pressure

329
00:18:18,230 --> 00:18:19,290
to conform

330
00:18:19,290 --> 00:18:23,000
I think we all know something about that
so here's the point again

331
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:26,230
is that the people I come up with these
big innovations the ones that you have

332
00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:28,669
in your mind right now

333
00:18:28,669 --> 00:18:32,390
they did that as often up conscience
conscious

334
00:18:32,390 --> 00:18:35,750
effort but charlie is part of an effort
to disrupt

335
00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:40,620
to impact change to you know exceed the
boundaries what they're supposed to do

336
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:43,669
to bypass the authority structures you
know you can come up with different

337
00:18:43,669 --> 00:18:44,620
labels for this

338
00:18:44,620 --> 00:18:49,040
type thing on so the disconnect then

339
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:54,950
is what I just described is probably not
a great match for being like say the CEO

340
00:18:54,950 --> 00:18:58,130
nonprofit corporation or being the

341
00:18:58,130 --> 00:19:03,140
the director aboard or being the public
face and say that the chief fundraiser

342
00:19:03,140 --> 00:19:07,090
or the on the personal rights all the
policies and and does the organizational

343
00:19:07,090 --> 00:19:07,658
structure

344
00:19:07,659 --> 00:19:10,840
or the manager the person that people go
to you you have

345
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:14,720
by discussions about you know the next
steps for the projects

346
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:18,110
got to deal with Dom I conflict

347
00:19:18,110 --> 00:19:22,100
management we have these projects and
talk about their track on here is that

348
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:24,520
devote a lot of time sometimes more than
the leader

349
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:28,220
but not usually I don't think by Tom
devote a whole lot of time to what they

350
00:19:28,220 --> 00:19:29,140
believe in

351
00:19:29,140 --> 00:19:32,590
on again to give some examples from the
open source project things like this

352
00:19:32,590 --> 00:19:35,810
the open content projects the
Wikipedia's other wiki

353
00:19:35,810 --> 00:19:39,158
oriented activities people are devoting

354
00:19:39,159 --> 00:19:42,620
hundreds maybe thousands of hours to
what they believe in and

355
00:19:42,620 --> 00:19:46,080
so there's conflict there's people are
motivated and is a leader well suited to

356
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:47,290
manage all those P

357
00:19:47,290 --> 00:19:50,960
all those folks all those different
views are in many cases not at all

358
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:54,560
and so what happens well one thing is
they might transition and start doing

359
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:57,490
that sort of thing that happens
transition management

360
00:19:57,490 --> 00:20:00,700
another is that they are good at
delegating and may find some people that

361
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:01,860
are motivated in those

362
00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:05,300
for those protect particular things arm
and let them do

363
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:09,658
I that aspect and they continue on with
whatever their interested in

364
00:20:09,659 --> 00:20:13,320
another what happens quite often is is
they leave they say okay success

365
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:17,050
I've now created great it up take my
idea now created a structure

366
00:20:17,050 --> 00:20:20,450
our help to help to create a structure
that will

367
00:20:20,450 --> 00:20:24,679
move on into the future with what it is
that I was Tom are hoping to achieve

368
00:20:24,679 --> 00:20:29,490
so college success move on to the next
on the next great idea

369
00:20:29,490 --> 00:20:33,840
are there's also potential course to be
destructive to the organization we see

370
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:37,389
unfortunately some examples and that in
history and these open projects from the

371
00:20:37,390 --> 00:20:38,620
last twenty years or so

372
00:20:38,620 --> 00:20:42,270
where the founders ensley became a
liability because the founders out maybe

373
00:20:42,270 --> 00:20:43,658
speaking against

374
00:20:43,659 --> 00:20:46,809
summer the organizational goals are to
come through the more through the

375
00:20:46,809 --> 00:20:47,540
hierarchy

376
00:20:47,540 --> 00:20:50,740
hierarchy meritocracy based on hierarchy

377
00:20:50,740 --> 00:20:54,909
arm this this is only temporary because
it's there it's not sustainable

378
00:20:54,909 --> 00:20:58,059
right because if the the founder leaders
out doing that

379
00:20:58,059 --> 00:21:02,139
then the volunteers go back to my
earlier slide the volunteers are gonna

380
00:21:02,140 --> 00:21:05,610
rapidly get the motivated and where they
can anyone else been up there on

381
00:21:05,610 --> 00:21:09,070
projects to get involved in competing
projects are going to something else

382
00:21:09,070 --> 00:21:12,678
you know they're not gonna say motivated
so essentially that's a i either a death

383
00:21:12,679 --> 00:21:13,810
spiral

384
00:21:13,810 --> 00:21:17,740
or that being disruptive either a death
death spiral

385
00:21:17,740 --> 00:21:22,649
or it is a on a pathway to some sort of
big change whether it's a leader

386
00:21:22,649 --> 00:21:24,820
stepping down moving out moving on

387
00:21:24,820 --> 00:21:28,090
are or something other your tapes have
approaches I

388
00:21:28,090 --> 00:21:33,310
mention arm and that that this will last
one i think is very common his a pursue

389
00:21:33,310 --> 00:21:36,560
rabbit holes at the core activity so if
you have a arm

390
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:39,879
are are you know big projects doing a
whole bunch of things

391
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:43,460
that the founder leader visionary I help
to set up

392
00:21:43,460 --> 00:21:47,050
and assorted running is returning along
an organizational structure you have a

393
00:21:47,050 --> 00:21:50,530
like I said whatever it might be a board
of directors at hand general manager in

394
00:21:50,530 --> 00:21:51,760
these types of things

395
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:55,690
arm whether voluntary paid paid by their
work

396
00:21:55,690 --> 00:22:00,480
contribute to the arm are nonprofit
organization we see a lot of these

397
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:02,570
different types of the apples

398
00:22:02,570 --> 00:22:05,720
arm but one approach for to deal with
the disconnect

399
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:09,399
up a leader not being that's really
great arm are

400
00:22:09,399 --> 00:22:12,550
sorta manager all this stuff is for them
to go off and do other

401
00:22:12,550 --> 00:22:16,200
suicide projects or or pursued apt in
particular areas

402
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:22,070
and Dom I and leave the rest with other
folks

403
00:22:22,070 --> 00:22:25,379
so what happens when your arm successful

404
00:22:25,380 --> 00:22:29,310
of course is our as I said earlier is
you end up with his organizational

405
00:22:29,310 --> 00:22:30,010
structure

406
00:22:30,010 --> 00:22:33,490
I'm sure there's some people in the room
and also people that that have

407
00:22:33,490 --> 00:22:34,880
experience with projects

408
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:38,770
where essentially where you really hope
as someone is maybe sorta founding are

409
00:22:38,770 --> 00:22:41,950
involved with downing one these efforts
you have not the idea you have an idea

410
00:22:41,950 --> 00:22:43,200
that you think

411
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:46,429
could play a role in fill in the blank
no change in the world

412
00:22:46,429 --> 00:22:50,120
educating children are you know saving
the whales you know it whatever it is

413
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:51,620
you might be interested in

414
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:54,780
arm that motivates you and you're really
hoping

415
00:22:54,780 --> 00:22:58,879
that our people sign on that people can
engage in people help out film

416
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:02,740
promos part is hard to change world solo
efforts early in the long run we want to

417
00:23:02,740 --> 00:23:04,020
do is om

418
00:23:04,020 --> 00:23:07,330
are you know if you're successful what
you wanna do

419
00:23:07,330 --> 00:23:10,840
again typically is end up as part of a
structure

420
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:14,428
as part about seven volunteers and again
maybe there's money involved talk about

421
00:23:14,429 --> 00:23:16,230
that in a moment maybe there's our

422
00:23:16,230 --> 00:23:19,620
on people getting paid to do about
whatever it is urs P there's a group of

423
00:23:19,620 --> 00:23:21,040
people are engaged

424
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:25,418
arm well so you came with these ideas

425
00:23:25,419 --> 00:23:28,899
and yeah I told them a you notice a
couple other motivations there but

426
00:23:28,899 --> 00:23:32,389
job in force are all very idiosyncratic
arm what

427
00:23:32,389 --> 00:23:35,830
motivates people to devote these
thousands maybe tens of thousands of

428
00:23:35,830 --> 00:23:36,860
hours maybe

429
00:23:36,860 --> 00:23:42,760
solo alone arm before people service or
to subscribe to your arm

430
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:45,919
your notions and and help out arms we
are the different

431
00:23:45,919 --> 00:23:49,130
arm inspirations believe better
mousetrap type thing

432
00:23:49,130 --> 00:23:52,270
I make the world better safer greener
Sarah are

433
00:23:52,270 --> 00:23:55,540
ditching the scratch the open-source our
motivation

434
00:23:55,540 --> 00:23:58,950
arm now whatever that is the leader

435
00:23:58,950 --> 00:24:03,320
came at that motivation from their own
whatever was their own background their

436
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:04,820
own experience their own

437
00:24:04,820 --> 00:24:08,149
training upgrade bringing believes the
various types

438
00:24:08,149 --> 00:24:12,679
and those of course will arm at least to
some extent

439
00:24:12,679 --> 00:24:17,990
sway the arm

440
00:24:17,990 --> 00:24:22,520
sway the way the leader talks about the
value of the project

441
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:25,570
and the thing that I that I found it
this is something that is not at all

442
00:24:25,570 --> 00:24:28,450
obvious which is why mention that night
and it's really the highlight of my

443
00:24:28,450 --> 00:24:29,100
other talk

444
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:32,190
that I would do it the camp last summer

445
00:24:32,190 --> 00:24:36,399
is that arm it might not matter that
much if the leaders goals

446
00:24:36,399 --> 00:24:41,080
are not so well line with the goals have
the key volunteers

447
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:45,110
I just find this to be our
counter-intuitive by something that is

448
00:24:45,110 --> 00:24:48,929
on I think guy demonstrated across a
whole number project people

449
00:24:48,929 --> 00:24:52,560
thing I am i interested by the way if
you wanna our caller step up

450
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:55,610
you can read apples or other stories
this type of thing

451
00:24:55,610 --> 00:24:59,950
but arm but what I found is that a lot
of the ball and here's

452
00:24:59,950 --> 00:25:03,130
they're engaged in these projects are
motivated by their own

453
00:25:03,130 --> 00:25:06,679
whatever may be back on his reappearance
upbringing so forth

454
00:25:06,679 --> 00:25:10,350
arm that might not agree with what
motivated are the leader

455
00:25:10,350 --> 00:25:13,830
so the case a project gutenberg: just
give you a concrete example are we have

456
00:25:13,830 --> 00:25:17,840
a bunch of people that are really
motivated by hyper accurate mark-up

457
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:21,270
are the original items they have a book
and you know printed

458
00:25:21,270 --> 00:25:25,730
Bookland entries from 100 years ago and
you want to digitize that in turn into a

459
00:25:25,730 --> 00:25:27,450
new book party in Berber

460
00:25:27,450 --> 00:25:30,980
we have a number on here they're
incredibly motivated by markup that

461
00:25:30,980 --> 00:25:33,659
communiques all the layout on that
original book

462
00:25:33,659 --> 00:25:36,929
you know where the line breaks were are
any misspellings that were in there

463
00:25:36,929 --> 00:25:38,159
hyphenation

464
00:25:38,159 --> 00:25:42,310
are there special are shapes for
characters or little love would cut type

465
00:25:42,310 --> 00:25:44,580
things at the beginning of chapters are
paragraphs

466
00:25:44,580 --> 00:25:48,050
they love to get that represented arm

467
00:25:48,050 --> 00:25:52,280
michael Hart founder are gutenberg
absolutely didn't care about that type

468
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:52,889
thing

469
00:25:52,889 --> 00:25:55,630
you want to get the books that are
really cared about the reading

470
00:25:55,630 --> 00:25:56,490
experience

471
00:25:56,490 --> 00:25:59,950
just didn't have it in mind it that's
the key you can stop it

472
00:25:59,950 --> 00:26:04,120
buddy I was not motivated by that see up
on fears that come along their trading

473
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:06,470
books and having other like-minded
volunteers

474
00:26:06,470 --> 00:26:09,800
that have these characteristics that
they care about and again the other

475
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:13,050
other thing though I don't online eat a
lot of other things that motivate people

476
00:26:13,050 --> 00:26:15,240
to contribute to that particular effort

477
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:19,340
arm and it was no problem was as long as
always saying no

478
00:26:19,340 --> 00:26:23,200
as long as known was preventing you from
pursuing the things that you cared about

479
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:27,540
arm are you can you can go ahead and be
motivated by

480
00:26:27,540 --> 00:26:31,070
by that particular aspect and again I
think we see there's a whole lot

481
00:26:31,070 --> 00:26:34,370
I open source project maybe see some
people are really motivated by

482
00:26:34,370 --> 00:26:37,590
the I user experience interface that
type of thing

483
00:26:37,590 --> 00:26:40,850
other people that really wants washed
bugs other people that wanna see the

484
00:26:40,850 --> 00:26:42,590
elegant and algorithms

485
00:26:42,590 --> 00:26:46,980
idea structures inside other people are
evangelists for particular coding

486
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:50,740
techniques for particular all languages
are particular

487
00:26:50,740 --> 00:26:54,330
are you know types and features that may
be our new so you have all these

488
00:26:54,330 --> 00:26:55,340
everything that motivate

489
00:26:55,340 --> 00:26:59,300
and if you're an effective project I
believe this is share characteristic

490
00:26:59,300 --> 00:27:03,100
but something that's not always act the
earth specially when Jordan engage with

491
00:27:03,100 --> 00:27:03,730
it

492
00:27:03,730 --> 00:27:06,980
arm its successful projects are very
often

493
00:27:06,980 --> 00:27:11,500
on subscribe to work time by people with
pretty different

494
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:14,679
motivations pretty different things the
problem there

495
00:27:14,679 --> 00:27:18,720
so on okay so I would take away on that
that's lies just that the

496
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:22,040
the alignment doesn't have to be near
nearly perfect and you can still get a

497
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:22,649
lot of our

498
00:27:22,649 --> 00:27:25,710
Ford progress now as I mentioned before

499
00:27:25,710 --> 00:27:29,129
one other problems with success is that
the project grows more people get

500
00:27:29,129 --> 00:27:32,600
involved are getting who knows what
media enquiries get people I figure out

501
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:34,440
how to commercialize its pretty common

502
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:37,770
with with a lot of these I can tell you
arm

503
00:27:37,770 --> 00:27:41,330
are you get more people want to
contribute and then ease in handling

504
00:27:41,330 --> 00:27:45,010
need some guidance and that doesn't
scale that well rise over the founder

505
00:27:45,010 --> 00:27:45,870
and suddenly

506
00:27:45,870 --> 00:27:49,879
you know you get a %uh some some
popularity that thats bites

507
00:27:49,879 --> 00:27:53,810
suddenly have a email inbox or telephone
answering machine with a 100 messages

508
00:27:53,810 --> 00:27:56,168
with people are really energized get
involved

509
00:27:56,169 --> 00:27:59,590
and and you can deal with them all you
don't have the time the of Molly he did

510
00:27:59,590 --> 00:28:00,590
with early folks

511
00:28:00,590 --> 00:28:03,669
saw a bunch of things that essentially
don't scale essentially start to break

512
00:28:03,669 --> 00:28:04,460
down

513
00:28:04,460 --> 00:28:07,110
when you go from this

514
00:28:07,110 --> 00:28:09,400
sort of solo effort to a small

515
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:13,760
poor small cadre to having on this
growth in the something being really

516
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:18,410
are are popular and so what what we've
seen we see all kinds examples one thing

517
00:28:18,410 --> 00:28:19,760
we've seen is that darn

518
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:24,120
are just it just feels that this
approach just feels

519
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:27,380
and are you know the victim of its own
success because

520
00:28:27,380 --> 00:28:30,760
job right reasons one is are

521
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:33,790
that something like what I described
with your

522
00:28:33,790 --> 00:28:38,290
email inbox filling up that the ability
of the leadership as

523
00:28:38,290 --> 00:28:42,610
as it is to bring in sustain the new
volunteers

524
00:28:42,610 --> 00:28:46,760
arm tales and so new volunteers there
they're pretty finicky

525
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:49,910
can tell you that having worked with
volunteers in in a number

526
00:28:49,910 --> 00:28:53,340
venues including this conference here
including greenberg

527
00:28:53,340 --> 00:28:56,980
winning couple other things are
volunteers if they don't

528
00:28:56,980 --> 00:29:01,040
get sort of a positive reinforcing
response

529
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:04,200
in a reasonable time frame are likely

530
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:07,970
pry more likely in I'm not 100 percent
likely at all but they're likely to find

531
00:29:07,970 --> 00:29:08,750
something else to do

532
00:29:08,750 --> 00:29:12,760
they're motivated by their own thing you
know their own approach to changing

533
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:13,450
world

534
00:29:13,450 --> 00:29:16,690
and in the world that we live in these
days there's not a shortage you know if

535
00:29:16,690 --> 00:29:18,180
you're motivated by by

536
00:29:18,180 --> 00:29:22,140
addressing hunger you know go on google
it or whatever you'll find a number of

537
00:29:22,140 --> 00:29:22,980
organisations

538
00:29:22,980 --> 00:29:26,550
you can get involved with same thing
education same thing literature same

539
00:29:26,550 --> 00:29:27,139
thing for

540
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:30,480
you know relying typeof open source our
software

541
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:34,310
project arm Darya legal approaches radio
so for

542
00:29:34,310 --> 00:29:38,260
you know you're not satisfied you're a
happy with some aspect interacting with

543
00:29:38,260 --> 00:29:38,620
with

544
00:29:38,620 --> 00:29:42,260
got some particular organization maybe
is getting started me there's a leader

545
00:29:42,260 --> 00:29:43,320
was in good ideas

546
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:46,649
then values upon here are likely to take
your efforts on

547
00:29:46,650 --> 00:29:50,750
elsewhere on the other thing is if
you're really successful

548
00:29:50,750 --> 00:29:54,020
are the next thing is people want to
start beating you up and say no no

549
00:29:54,020 --> 00:29:55,020
you're doing it wrong

550
00:29:55,020 --> 00:29:58,430
and we had some really fascinating
experiences again to

551
00:29:58,430 --> 00:30:01,670
user personal are reflection with
gutenberg arm

552
00:30:01,670 --> 00:30:05,150
and i win gave love these Michael gays
usually usually both got to receive

553
00:30:05,150 --> 00:30:05,640
these

554
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:11,390
on is our he will I i notice your
YouTube on your skill on fears but other

555
00:30:11,390 --> 00:30:14,200
people that are putting some level of
effort into but not great effort

556
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:15,590
sometimes a a really

557
00:30:15,590 --> 00:30:19,490
a very high level effort so berries law
but people I care

558
00:30:19,490 --> 00:30:23,410
quite a bit will essentially tell us
that we're doing a wrong

559
00:30:23,410 --> 00:30:26,910
so this question about mark up that I
mentioned are choosing languages are

560
00:30:26,910 --> 00:30:27,510
choosing

561
00:30:27,510 --> 00:30:30,920
spin-off products got a lot of that all
even al

562
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:34,290
in a moment I'll tell you a story about
that are but people essentially

563
00:30:34,290 --> 00:30:39,540
arm tell the leader that the leader is
doing it wrong they say no no no this

564
00:30:39,540 --> 00:30:40,960
isn't what you're here for

565
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:44,040
you're here for what my vision up you
know what motivated me

566
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:48,129
is is here for and so that's where that
for a business to disconnect that I

567
00:30:48,130 --> 00:30:49,490
mention a few slides ago

568
00:30:49,490 --> 00:30:54,650
arm can create essentially conflict and
how you deal with that i think is

569
00:30:54,650 --> 00:30:58,420
job is not there's not one right
solution I different leaders

570
00:30:58,420 --> 00:31:02,000
sometimes the of that conflict rather
poorly my observation

571
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:05,030
but arm are but the fact is that that

572
00:31:05,030 --> 00:31:09,330
to are that disconnect annual the
conflict or within your organization

573
00:31:09,330 --> 00:31:13,070
but then also you get if you're
successful you get sorted bomb

574
00:31:13,070 --> 00:31:17,520
where they may be monday-morning
quarterback types are you know outsiders

575
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:21,210
that are saying no you're doing it wrong
or where will this is good you had kind

576
00:31:21,210 --> 00:31:22,090
of a good idea

577
00:31:22,090 --> 00:31:25,060
and does matter how revolutionary why's
that matters for your whole career

578
00:31:25,060 --> 00:31:27,110
doesn't matter if you're incredibly
train for it

579
00:31:27,110 --> 00:31:30,440
whatever lies RI by the time it's there

580
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:34,400
by the time is working well seems easy

581
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:37,720
and suddenly people can can pick at it
so it's a really a monday-morning

582
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:40,880
quarterback type thing you know people
spend their whole career link play

583
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:41,900
football and and

584
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:45,980
training up and and on the machines and
and learning and rolling and so forth

585
00:31:45,980 --> 00:31:49,310
and to get that perfect Paseo nine times
out of ten

586
00:31:49,310 --> 00:31:52,270
and lasts I well you know they screwed
up they didn't know there's a you know

587
00:31:52,270 --> 00:31:54,280
that they were doing this right they
weren't doing that right

588
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:57,430
on in the same thing happens with these
these open projects

589
00:31:57,430 --> 00:32:00,880
all the successes live here really
successful next thing that happens is

590
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:01,770
people are telling you

591
00:32:01,770 --> 00:32:06,520
are you doing it wrong are yeah the
quick got side story on that is we just

592
00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:08,020
spun up on July 4th

593
00:32:08,020 --> 00:32:13,080
I think alt cell got timber go to work
and this is the %uh the self-publishing

594
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:14,540
Portal Project Gutenberg

595
00:32:14,540 --> 00:32:17,340
now we're going to a lot of details on
why we did that suffice to say that

596
00:32:17,340 --> 00:32:19,720
greenberg's not that great at
self-publishing

597
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:23,370
for contemporary authors I know there's
a lot of people approach us

598
00:32:23,370 --> 00:32:26,550
that want to get their stuff online
through the Gutenberg High name

599
00:32:26,550 --> 00:32:29,750
and so are one of our excellent
excellent on

600
00:32:29,750 --> 00:32:34,010
participants I spun a web site as the
first thing that happens we spin this up

601
00:32:34,010 --> 00:32:36,680
the first thing that happens is a bunch
people say no you're doing it wrong

602
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:40,330
this is in writing I you have ads we
don't have ads what's this

603
00:32:40,330 --> 00:32:45,510
are using PDF will use PDF what's this
and so they're they're saying that word

604
00:32:45,510 --> 00:32:47,790
that we're doing here there's there's
some naysayers

605
00:32:47,790 --> 00:32:51,020
people later pretty happy with it with
some naysayers are essentially saying no

606
00:32:51,020 --> 00:32:54,230
you're doing it wrong this is not
consistent with the goals and motivation

607
00:32:54,230 --> 00:32:55,060
to the project

608
00:32:55,060 --> 00:32:58,090
and let me tell you for a fact I know
this is i mean

609
00:32:58,090 --> 00:33:01,380
apart from my role I this is something
that Michael and I talked about for

610
00:33:01,380 --> 00:33:02,330
years

611
00:33:02,330 --> 00:33:05,130
before he finally put into place that we
actually even made a couple of false

612
00:33:05,130 --> 00:33:06,230
starts

613
00:33:06,230 --> 00:33:11,360
where we I think arm probably out say
inappropriately but slowly in retrospect

614
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:12,790
I wish we hadn't

615
00:33:12,790 --> 00:33:16,240
listened to some of our key motivated

616
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:21,010
adviser you know participant cokie
volunteer stuff like that

617
00:33:21,010 --> 00:33:24,010
and we didn't wanna upset them

618
00:33:24,010 --> 00:33:28,310
and they were telling us I know this is
what we're here for

619
00:33:28,310 --> 00:33:32,740
and it became essentially a difficult
thing to go from

620
00:33:32,740 --> 00:33:37,140
are the major direction which has a sort
a big umbrella I'll

621
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:41,230
I picture by a narrower

622
00:33:41,230 --> 00:33:46,170
actual function acts like he knows what
we do its part in this bigger picture

623
00:33:46,170 --> 00:33:49,480
that that Michael and I and and other
people can articulate

624
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:53,830
but was now is evident the people that
were engaged motivating

625
00:33:53,830 --> 00:33:57,420
backers I mentioned earlier the so arm

626
00:33:57,420 --> 00:34:01,080
a way that such as a little bit of a
story where where innovating

627
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:05,460
arm can be can be perilous your cube on
here's my tell you that

628
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:08,409
this is what we're here for and the
active you have to deal with that you

629
00:34:08,409 --> 00:34:10,920
don't want to upset those volunteers we
need them

630
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:14,170
right or maybe do not always on your we
need them is the key

631
00:34:14,170 --> 00:34:17,510
no one upset those folks but at the same
time

632
00:34:17,510 --> 00:34:20,770
the the purpose in being there is

633
00:34:20,770 --> 00:34:24,719
arm to move morning bro and and any
leader trust me anyone that comes up

634
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:25,860
with this project

635
00:34:25,860 --> 00:34:29,390
they got a bunch of other ideas you know
there's what they're doing now

636
00:34:29,389 --> 00:34:33,819
what they have been doing they got a
bunch of other ideas that go beyond that

637
00:34:33,820 --> 00:34:37,280
okay so on and are

638
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:41,140
i cn i just mentioned as last point on
the slide the idea that it might be that

639
00:34:41,139 --> 00:34:43,409
is just a natural process do these these

640
00:34:43,409 --> 00:34:46,969
cited actors and discussing that on

641
00:34:46,970 --> 00:34:51,600
are that is difficult for these types
vote open projects last I decades

642
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:55,739
and surly arm we don't see that many
that have that type of longevity

643
00:34:55,740 --> 00:34:59,450
on the other hand most limit not been
around so long and so we don't know yet

644
00:34:59,450 --> 00:35:00,149
write the word

645
00:35:00,150 --> 00:35:03,270
the decision the outcome is not yet
known

646
00:35:03,270 --> 00:35:06,009
because there's so many private eto
started particularly since the Internet

647
00:35:06,010 --> 00:35:06,850
boom

648
00:35:06,850 --> 00:35:10,060
in around I 1995 and and

649
00:35:10,060 --> 00:35:14,529
again in the early 2000's and with all
the dot-com and stuff like that

650
00:35:14,530 --> 00:35:17,880
are I think we have a lot of projects
that are less than a decade old

651
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:21,530
and some that have actually faded away
or change I don't think at least I don't

652
00:35:21,530 --> 00:35:25,090
feel maybe some people study didn't have
some ideas I don't feel like we know

653
00:35:25,090 --> 00:35:28,380
yet weather patterns gonna be but it's a
possibility at least

654
00:35:28,380 --> 00:35:32,950
that there's just a natural evolution
there's a

655
00:35:32,950 --> 00:35:38,060
self arm

656
00:35:38,060 --> 00:35:43,670
essentially a a built-in exploration to
some these approaches

657
00:35:43,670 --> 00:35:47,390
and maybe that's not bad to me that's
not bad ours we talk about money just a

658
00:35:47,390 --> 00:35:48,600
little bit on

659
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:52,560
in the gutenberg realm we were really
hard I have a day job

660
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:56,009
good burgers net running hope is not in
here play that

661
00:35:56,010 --> 00:35:59,040
but the arm

662
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:02,350
we worked really hard to be immune from
money

663
00:36:02,350 --> 00:36:05,490
to be a 501 c3 as a library

664
00:36:05,490 --> 00:36:09,540
are pursuing some pretty rigorous in the
in Greenberg's case procedures for

665
00:36:09,540 --> 00:36:10,850
things like copyright

666
00:36:10,850 --> 00:36:15,089
to make us not a hundred percent immune
but extremely resistant

667
00:36:15,090 --> 00:36:18,780
to few things that would happen if we
got sued for all our money

668
00:36:18,780 --> 00:36:22,250
if if we had no money at all lost her
ability

669
00:36:22,250 --> 00:36:25,630
I this whiskey for us it was key for
Michael's

670
00:36:25,630 --> 00:36:29,470
approach to things are it's not a surly
practical though

671
00:36:29,470 --> 00:36:32,540
for everybody for every project a lot of
time there is money involved

672
00:36:32,540 --> 00:36:36,029
lot of time there's a motivation maybe
not by the founder

673
00:36:36,030 --> 00:36:39,340
often up by the founder but by people
that are heavily involved

674
00:36:39,340 --> 00:36:43,800
volunteers to to somehow make their
living release get reimbursed for %uh

675
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:45,570
some their activities are beyond the by

676
00:36:45,570 --> 00:36:49,640
you know supplies are or whatever it is
that they need arm

677
00:36:49,640 --> 00:36:53,540
and this this brings risks because the
the fighting over money

678
00:36:53,540 --> 00:36:57,259
seems to happen are organizations I
attend you

679
00:36:57,260 --> 00:37:01,280
are if there's money involved tend to be
extremely

680
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:05,150
arm geared towards oversight above money

681
00:37:05,150 --> 00:37:07,200
yearly expenses and the

682
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:10,690
you know various in the eighties the %uh
the 501 c3

683
00:37:10,690 --> 00:37:15,500
non-profit charity status and why they
vary by state so forth and so on your

684
00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:18,920
donors that want to know about your
status are so so

685
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:22,720
unfortunately money can be the tail that
wags the dog

686
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:26,000
in some cases arm so everything there

687
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:29,740
course is eyes for this too to %ah go
away on tradesy walk-up

688
00:37:29,740 --> 00:37:33,700
outright how long before restart have
the idea if we actually did all that

689
00:37:33,700 --> 00:37:35,549
work to create the Feb 23

690
00:37:35,549 --> 00:37:39,470
well was actually Michael that Tom odds
as private 10 years

691
00:37:39,470 --> 00:37:43,059
and actually michel et finally got
around to doing it we had arm

692
00:37:43,059 --> 00:37:46,119
a number I love are really really good

693
00:37:46,119 --> 00:37:49,849
copyright attorneys that were involved
in there is one fellow that did the

694
00:37:49,849 --> 00:37:53,349
trademark license and I i mention on the
slide earlier playing

695
00:37:53,349 --> 00:37:56,450
little smaller read but other project
Gutenberg license

696
00:37:56,450 --> 00:37:59,660
is essentially and then you can read it
involve a little bit as

697
00:37:59,660 --> 00:38:04,690
more or less the same essences was the
Project Gutenberg license was first

698
00:38:04,690 --> 00:38:05,650
released in

699
00:38:05,650 --> 00:38:09,180
in a predecessor to its current form in
1993 I'll

700
00:38:09,180 --> 00:38:12,308
the new General Public License I think
1992

701
00:38:12,309 --> 00:38:16,170
so Stallman and heart were around the
same time there other people as well

702
00:38:16,170 --> 00:38:20,569
on saying essentially how do we lock
this stuff then you're really care about

703
00:38:20,569 --> 00:38:21,670
freedom in the case have

704
00:38:21,670 --> 00:38:24,990
GPL it's for copyrighted work software
essentially

705
00:38:24,990 --> 00:38:28,319
in the case gutenberg it's in public
domain

706
00:38:28,319 --> 00:38:31,369
essentially saying this is public domain
not copyrighted

707
00:38:31,369 --> 00:38:34,660
which is a in case you don't understand
that it's a pretty interesting

708
00:38:34,660 --> 00:38:37,670
different I want well I'm now but Tom

709
00:38:37,670 --> 00:38:41,450
so we'll there'd been some lawyers
involved in copyright side

710
00:38:41,450 --> 00:38:45,890
trademark side and they basically said
early on probably before 1993

711
00:38:45,890 --> 00:38:49,410
Michael II don't recall being part of
that discussion but they said early on

712
00:38:49,410 --> 00:38:51,160
hey you know you're screwing around with

713
00:38:51,160 --> 00:38:55,348
with are having your personal effects
your personal

714
00:38:55,349 --> 00:39:00,140
you know efforts tied into on this
volunteer effort you're asking people to

715
00:39:00,140 --> 00:39:02,250
donate some like that and you ain't got
no

716
00:39:02,250 --> 00:39:05,530
corporation you're not you know 501 c3
anything like that

717
00:39:05,530 --> 00:39:09,760
are not incorporated arm and so I think
that discussion happen for about a

718
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:10,309
decade

719
00:39:10,309 --> 00:39:13,960
for finally happened and and I've been
involved

720
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:17,720
I said I've been running the technology
is the key technology the FTP servers

721
00:39:17,720 --> 00:39:20,829
over servers back then I know generally
web servers

722
00:39:20,829 --> 00:39:24,799
on for something like eight or ten years
by the time Michael came to me is a

723
00:39:24,799 --> 00:39:28,280
can to be director and that it has been
great

724
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:32,190
really very very good very wonderful but
w/e took a long time to convince you

725
00:39:32,190 --> 00:39:34,910
that that goes back to that day I
bernard shaw quote that I read

726
00:39:34,910 --> 00:39:38,609
I'm are michael is a great example we
have so many now

727
00:39:38,609 --> 00:39:42,328
is part of what what more they made it
do the team so many people I got started

728
00:39:42,329 --> 00:39:45,540
in something like the sixties or the
seventies we we named our room you're

729
00:39:45,540 --> 00:39:45,910
after

730
00:39:45,910 --> 00:39:49,420
tells insane is a good good examples tom
is a good example lot a lot of people

731
00:39:49,420 --> 00:39:50,059
out there

732
00:39:50,059 --> 00:39:54,020
I to evolve little bit younger you know
but job but not too far off

733
00:39:54,020 --> 00:39:57,319
from that we have a lot of people I got
motivated on

734
00:39:57,319 --> 00:40:01,150
in that period growth when you know
early PC days you think

735
00:40:01,150 --> 00:40:05,030
wise in jobs and things like that you
know a lot of people I got involved

736
00:40:05,030 --> 00:40:06,390
they're still on the scene

737
00:40:06,390 --> 00:40:09,790
these guys are getting old personally
was then revised now some are

738
00:40:09,790 --> 00:40:13,369
woman as well but they're getting all
and our and they're gonna

739
00:40:13,369 --> 00:40:16,740
they're dropping you know they're I have
this light on that they are mean the

740
00:40:16,740 --> 00:40:23,030
as the right here yeah each year dozens
of these well-known project founders die

741
00:40:23,030 --> 00:40:24,880
or otherwise of course to

742
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:28,440
to step down you know they get all day
there their problems various types

743
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:32,079
are by not that's early problems but
something rather happens they're not

744
00:40:32,079 --> 00:40:32,809
able to be

745
00:40:32,809 --> 00:40:36,630
engaged as as much arm

746
00:40:36,630 --> 00:40:40,010
Michael is typical in that that way
where question

747
00:40:40,010 --> 00:40:44,730
down a so so you're next five years at
that time happens

748
00:40:44,730 --> 00:40:48,910
and essentially what I said that people
are are getting old they get they lose

749
00:40:48,910 --> 00:40:50,420
their motivation sometimes

750
00:40:50,420 --> 00:40:53,630
in various ways and arm so what do we do

751
00:40:53,630 --> 00:40:57,130
well one thing I mention on a previous
life maybe that's the process

752
00:40:57,130 --> 00:41:00,819
you know maybe that's the way it goes
especially because is very difficult

753
00:41:00,819 --> 00:41:04,230
I think we have some examples i think is
very difficult to spin up a really

754
00:41:04,230 --> 00:41:06,190
functional organization to maintain
these

755
00:41:06,190 --> 00:41:09,730
are you can think of some example our
lives think Apache is really good

756
00:41:09,730 --> 00:41:13,660
exemplar for organizational structure I
don't think wiki

757
00:41:13,660 --> 00:41:16,730
r-pa is yet a good example or maybe
it'll become

758
00:41:16,730 --> 00:41:20,010
I think there's a lot of dysfunction
there and different opinions this

759
00:41:20,010 --> 00:41:23,290
not your ex Express is too much by the
arm

760
00:41:23,290 --> 00:41:26,630
the fact is that sometimes there's

761
00:41:26,630 --> 00:41:30,510
there's a structure that can survive a
leadership a lot of time to think beyond

762
00:41:30,510 --> 00:41:33,819
leaders such a a key role you know what
to do

763
00:41:33,819 --> 00:41:37,710
so %ah so poorly can do is look at what
the leaders actually doing

764
00:41:37,710 --> 00:41:42,150
I so leaders gone you know babe even
temporarily unable to contribute

765
00:41:42,150 --> 00:41:45,730
you might lose their effort they're
putting in 1000 hours per year

766
00:41:45,730 --> 00:41:49,190
and by a lot of us are engaged in
projects where that's the case that the

767
00:41:49,190 --> 00:41:49,779
leader

768
00:41:49,779 --> 00:41:53,940
is odd i'm talking about the thought
leader the visionary the founder

769
00:41:53,940 --> 00:41:57,660
not so much the organizational years
michael Hart in this case not the great

770
00:41:57,660 --> 00:41:59,339
movie but

771
00:41:59,339 --> 00:42:02,440
of course there could be a lot
overlapping roles by

772
00:42:02,440 --> 00:42:06,109
our bodies thousand hours it per year
might be lost and it might be that those

773
00:42:06,109 --> 00:42:07,869
thousands of hours ago per year

774
00:42:07,869 --> 00:42:11,529
really really necessary and that the
other volunteers that might be putting

775
00:42:11,529 --> 00:42:13,760
in 1000 1000 hours per year

776
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:17,290
maybe they're motivated for their thing

777
00:42:17,290 --> 00:42:20,339
rights in the case at project gutenberg:
we have people that really love regular

778
00:42:20,339 --> 00:42:21,339
languages

779
00:42:21,339 --> 00:42:24,740
there a lot particular genres that
really love doing the yom

780
00:42:24,740 --> 00:42:28,510
we call the whitewashing which is the
final process of assembling books and

781
00:42:28,510 --> 00:42:32,589
and fixing air errors and stuff like
that people love scanning

782
00:42:32,589 --> 00:42:35,700
great fantastic we need those of course

783
00:42:35,700 --> 00:42:38,880
their part in this this I distributed
structure that's the only the project

784
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:39,569
gutenberg: way

785
00:42:39,569 --> 00:42:42,920
but all projects have the same thing
here's the think they'll

786
00:42:42,920 --> 00:42:46,029
those folks probably don't want to or
not equipped you are not motivated to

787
00:42:46,029 --> 00:42:49,210
you and and might not even be ready or
willing to devote

788
00:42:49,210 --> 00:42:52,299
their time to you being the
organizational

789
00:42:52,299 --> 00:42:56,299
leader taking on organizational we see
this all the time i send out notes to

790
00:42:56,299 --> 00:42:56,619
the

791
00:42:56,619 --> 00:43:00,559
greenberg mailing list the newsletters
say hey we can use some people were

792
00:43:00,559 --> 00:43:03,180
thinking of getting together we got his
plan you Michael side

793
00:43:03,180 --> 00:43:06,200
died where we gonna do next what are
some people ideas

794
00:43:06,200 --> 00:43:09,770
and you'd be amazed at how few responses
I get

795
00:43:09,770 --> 00:43:14,540
I mean literally handfuls responses and
often those on even go anywhere

796
00:43:14,540 --> 00:43:17,049
you know people a one-out some
discussion but they think there's

797
00:43:17,049 --> 00:43:18,009
someone

798
00:43:18,010 --> 00:43:21,670
you know didn't doesn't someone already
take care as well you know I'm someone

799
00:43:21,670 --> 00:43:25,990
in a lot of cases but arm but there's
not a lot of someone's out there

800
00:43:25,990 --> 00:43:30,029
right so and as a volunteer meritocracy
type situation

801
00:43:30,029 --> 00:43:33,250
your care about it step and and take
charge

802
00:43:33,250 --> 00:43:36,920
and and our way it's not always the way
every project is a lot different

803
00:43:36,920 --> 00:43:41,130
Sears go through actually packing may be
on the other side use an example

804
00:43:41,130 --> 00:43:45,510
a structured approach to arms were
moving forward

805
00:43:45,510 --> 00:43:49,299
the become a project that patchy are the
gutenberg ways to say yes

806
00:43:49,299 --> 00:43:53,040
do it your encourage go for what you
need ball will put a

807
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:57,460
newsletter will give your website
whatever you think is the barrier

808
00:43:57,460 --> 00:44:01,089
we're gonna remove and the real barrier
turns out to be effort

809
00:44:01,089 --> 00:44:04,910
turns out to be someone you whoever may
be you're putting in the

810
00:44:04,910 --> 00:44:09,058
the time so with Los workers were really
out really key

811
00:44:09,059 --> 00:44:13,640
arm also this this idea of planning our
leaders are sometimes pretty good

812
00:44:13,640 --> 00:44:15,480
articulating a long-term plan

813
00:44:15,480 --> 00:44:19,510
I sometimes not so much often what
happens is as a

814
00:44:19,510 --> 00:44:23,670
I'll to earlier leader might have this
long-term plan but they discovered that

815
00:44:23,670 --> 00:44:24,960
when they talk about it

816
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:28,890
in great detail they upset the
volunteers because the volunteers are

817
00:44:28,890 --> 00:44:30,430
motivated by something else

818
00:44:30,430 --> 00:44:34,450
so for example in the case a good bird a
lot a long-term plan deals with literacy

819
00:44:34,450 --> 00:44:36,339
deals and the quality deals with

820
00:44:36,339 --> 00:44:41,359
arm are arm improved education is are
these are pretty good

821
00:44:41,359 --> 00:44:45,150
I things to subscribe to you but also
large the goals that Michael had its

822
00:44:45,150 --> 00:44:46,170
really I share

823
00:44:46,170 --> 00:44:50,500
have to do with Dom a fighting
oppression have to do with questioning

824
00:44:50,500 --> 00:44:51,799
authority have to do with

825
00:44:51,799 --> 00:44:55,640
arm I you know shaping a better society
and and

826
00:44:55,640 --> 00:44:58,779
those again sound pretty good but as
soon as you're getting into details it

827
00:44:58,779 --> 00:45:00,460
doesn't take too long before

828
00:45:00,460 --> 00:45:03,540
people disagree with you people have
their own there are different views

829
00:45:03,540 --> 00:45:07,099
so essentially the leader I think
sometimes to be successful has to hide

830
00:45:07,099 --> 00:45:08,240
their light under a bushel

831
00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:12,200
little bit is use the analogy arm

832
00:45:12,200 --> 00:45:15,690
the figurehead I thing is is important
on

833
00:45:15,690 --> 00:45:19,170
some these are a really big names
stahlman comes to mind I yourself

834
00:45:19,170 --> 00:45:21,690
Stallman were lost I don't think you
would decrease

835
00:45:21,690 --> 00:45:26,869
the our code output very much my opinion
not sure if this is absolutely correct

836
00:45:26,869 --> 00:45:30,270
I don't think he's doing a lot of coding
for the free software projects

837
00:45:30,270 --> 00:45:33,890
but he sure is an important figure head
an outspoken 1 and so what would happen

838
00:45:33,890 --> 00:45:34,839
if you were to become

839
00:45:34,839 --> 00:45:40,250
on are unavailable arm

840
00:45:40,250 --> 00:45:44,049
and again think if your own to give your
own examples from the different projects

841
00:45:44,049 --> 00:45:44,380
might

842
00:45:44,380 --> 00:45:48,940
no better be involved with arm and this
sell-off instability conflict is

843
00:45:48,940 --> 00:45:50,400
important conflict happens

844
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:53,740
in in so many these projects and on

845
00:45:53,740 --> 00:45:57,630
I and is often the leader that willingly
or not

846
00:45:57,630 --> 00:46:00,819
is go to to resolve the the conflict

847
00:46:00,819 --> 00:46:03,920
and so what happens of course if that
role that person is

848
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:07,339
is unavailable or may be unwilling
temporarily in some

849
00:46:07,339 --> 00:46:11,000
limited situation bonneville to resolve
the conflict

850
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:13,990
who knows what's going to happen right
you might have lost productivity you

851
00:46:13,990 --> 00:46:14,270
might

852
00:46:14,270 --> 00:46:18,170
lose key volunteers you might have fork
source or a spin-off products for people

853
00:46:18,170 --> 00:46:21,640
you know pick up and leave and do things
their own way

854
00:46:21,640 --> 00:46:24,980
I your or one %uh the most damaging
months I feel

855
00:46:24,980 --> 00:46:28,650
is you might simply have a stall you
might have things not happen for a while

856
00:46:28,650 --> 00:46:29,980
they really should be

857
00:46:29,980 --> 00:46:33,460
happening to the gutenberg
self-publishing is a good example we had

858
00:46:33,460 --> 00:46:35,450
conflict with that I let's back off a
bit

859
00:46:35,450 --> 00:46:38,589
think about this and then two years
three years later now

860
00:46:38,589 --> 00:46:42,060
we said I said actually in this case

861
00:46:42,060 --> 00:46:45,339
enough right you know we knows important
its totally on

862
00:46:45,339 --> 00:46:49,109
topic for us and I and the fact that
some people are going to like it

863
00:46:49,109 --> 00:46:52,359
well we're gonna try to be gentle and
say look you

864
00:46:52,359 --> 00:46:55,839
do what motivates you or not we're
saying yes you're not saying they'll

865
00:46:55,839 --> 00:46:57,029
continue on

866
00:46:57,029 --> 00:47:01,029
do you do your thing I grow your thing
take more leadership

867
00:47:01,029 --> 00:47:04,040
absolutely absolutely you have a lot
ability

868
00:47:04,040 --> 00:47:07,270
what you don't have this is actually key
to the way we did things with

869
00:47:07,270 --> 00:47:11,060
gutenberg and project maybe a somewhat
different approach

870
00:47:11,060 --> 00:47:14,450
by the key with good burger is do your
thing you get yes is all over the place

871
00:47:14,450 --> 00:47:15,470
you get all kinds

872
00:47:15,470 --> 00:47:19,930
support where you don't have is now
where you don't have the ability to say

873
00:47:19,930 --> 00:47:22,240
no no you can't do this you're not doing
it right

874
00:47:22,240 --> 00:47:25,359
I believe you must have this markup I
believe you must have this cycle

875
00:47:25,359 --> 00:47:28,020
literature I believe you must have this
organizational structure

876
00:47:28,020 --> 00:47:31,200
I believe you must have color images now
black and white image

877
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:34,450
only sometimes things that come up in
our private different product

878
00:47:34,450 --> 00:47:39,119
different things you know user
interfaces licenses just online

879
00:47:39,119 --> 00:47:42,160
that something you don't get to do you
don't get this and you don't get a say

880
00:47:42,160 --> 00:47:42,720
no

881
00:47:42,720 --> 00:47:47,369
say yes arm and unfortunately of course
we're in a world where that water

882
00:47:47,369 --> 00:47:51,390
far %uh structure your lot about steal
those

883
00:47:51,390 --> 00:47:54,868
that feels talks I want things he likes
to talk about

884
00:47:54,869 --> 00:47:58,480
is that the ability to say no is often
the only power that people have

885
00:47:58,480 --> 00:48:02,680
or hold things up in all clean I did
something meritocracy take things were

886
00:48:02,680 --> 00:48:04,828
talking about

887
00:48:04,829 --> 00:48:08,440
trying keep an eye on my my time here so
on

888
00:48:08,440 --> 00:48:12,880
thank you thank you much so the arm are
so strategies as

889
00:48:12,880 --> 00:48:17,020
as alluded to earlier these are not I
wouldn't say these are are necessarily

890
00:48:17,020 --> 00:48:21,240
credibly on eliminating or eliminated

891
00:48:21,240 --> 00:48:24,599
but you can get some strategies to to
mitigate loss year

892
00:48:24,599 --> 00:48:27,630
and the the first one hears it was
obvious which is some serious action

893
00:48:27,630 --> 00:48:28,160
plan

894
00:48:28,160 --> 00:48:31,339
and leaders these visionary folks

895
00:48:31,339 --> 00:48:36,060
usually are not so good at yes usually
that's good I'll often they can even see

896
00:48:36,060 --> 00:48:37,270
their role

897
00:48:37,270 --> 00:48:40,150
that clearly is there you know they're
really close they've been doing this for

898
00:48:40,150 --> 00:48:41,410
years decades

899
00:48:41,410 --> 00:48:44,569
in some cases many many and thousands
hours

900
00:48:44,569 --> 00:48:48,829
arm and even if there are motivated even
if they had this great idea

901
00:48:48,829 --> 00:48:52,460
they might not be that effective in
making it happen and that's really what

902
00:48:52,460 --> 00:48:53,279
happened with

903
00:48:53,279 --> 00:48:56,970
with gutenberg where where there was a
plan and likely I was

904
00:48:56,970 --> 00:49:00,059
I was implication for a whole number
years

905
00:49:00,059 --> 00:49:03,240
are so I I have a good ideas where we
want to go

906
00:49:03,240 --> 00:49:06,589
but it was never that well articulated
so unfortunately people might challenge

907
00:49:06,589 --> 00:49:07,369
me

908
00:49:07,369 --> 00:49:10,720
and say hour or so other people are
involved with our timber

909
00:49:10,720 --> 00:49:13,849
and say hey you know that we don't think
that's what Michael had mine

910
00:49:13,849 --> 00:49:17,710
and all I can do is guys they would I
believe what I discuss

911
00:49:17,710 --> 00:49:20,930
like that on for so we can point to a
written document

912
00:49:20,930 --> 00:49:24,240
work there's written documents they
don't give the you say we think this

913
00:49:24,240 --> 00:49:25,220
gives the guides

914
00:49:25,220 --> 00:49:28,359
you look at more detail his government
doesn't give you the guy

915
00:49:28,359 --> 00:49:31,799
like the Supreme Court are your
interpretation of the Constitution

916
00:49:31,799 --> 00:49:35,029
matter how was ridin there's room were
on

917
00:49:35,029 --> 00:49:39,730
interpretation if you don't have the
writer there the originator earlier that

918
00:49:39,730 --> 00:49:44,559
founder to mom to interpret than that
that's a problem

919
00:49:44,559 --> 00:49:49,180
arm okay so I was when I was a special
plan obviously though there and even

920
00:49:49,180 --> 00:49:53,410
a I just said a couple things work
difficult to do but any succession plan

921
00:49:53,410 --> 00:49:55,250
it's prolly better than

922
00:49:55,250 --> 00:49:58,420
then right succession plan

923
00:49:58,420 --> 00:50:01,460
the session arm

924
00:50:01,460 --> 00:50:04,579
so a

925
00:50:04,579 --> 00:50:07,930
trying to get people to commit this step
up obviously that happened with me or a

926
00:50:07,930 --> 00:50:10,180
fairly long time ago i think is a good
burger

927
00:50:10,180 --> 00:50:13,799
and willingly so and it's been wonderful
they said but the arm

928
00:50:13,799 --> 00:50:17,730
unfortunately the fact is that they are
finding people that might be willing to

929
00:50:17,730 --> 00:50:19,339
step in if necessary

930
00:50:19,339 --> 00:50:22,470
and take take on increased
responsibilities

931
00:50:22,470 --> 00:50:25,720
seems to be pretty difficult but I've
discovered is that I

932
00:50:25,720 --> 00:50:28,589
as I mentioned earlier people are
motivated by whether motivated by an

933
00:50:28,589 --> 00:50:29,299
often that

934
00:50:29,299 --> 00:50:33,270
not essentially leadership the people
are motivated by leadership

935
00:50:33,270 --> 00:50:37,569
often are not people that want to come
up to the meritocracy

936
00:50:37,569 --> 00:50:41,339
it's really a challenge and that if they
do come up with a meritocracy of it

937
00:50:41,339 --> 00:50:42,940
they're not good leaders

938
00:50:42,940 --> 00:50:46,279
because what got them up through the
meritocracy yes a little bit like the

939
00:50:46,279 --> 00:50:49,140
Peter Principle you know where your eyes
your level the competence

940
00:50:49,140 --> 00:50:52,759
what got you up to the meritocracy might
have been the case gutenberg you know

941
00:50:52,759 --> 00:50:54,990
are really great attention to detail

942
00:50:54,990 --> 00:50:58,759
you're really really really find a
quality control in incredible

943
00:50:58,759 --> 00:51:02,829
our devotion to why you know being then
take an accurate and so forth with

944
00:51:02,829 --> 00:51:05,859
during books and you try to place other
projects

945
00:51:05,859 --> 00:51:10,940
thinking up on and I love you know how
does that make you good at

946
00:51:10,940 --> 00:51:15,359
managing finances has my make motivating
volunteers have that make you good at

947
00:51:15,359 --> 00:51:16,799
interacting with media

948
00:51:16,799 --> 00:51:20,440
just going with the holistic things that
your experience even multi-year

949
00:51:20,440 --> 00:51:21,900
experience without power

950
00:51:21,900 --> 00:51:26,710
he won't hear didn't particularly
generate

951
00:51:26,710 --> 00:51:31,119
arm yeah that like said the the
alternate there is OK find someone that

952
00:51:31,119 --> 00:51:31,890
comes in

953
00:51:31,890 --> 00:51:36,000
and they're a person I was a go-getter
and their organizational persons

954
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:39,130
like that well okay that might work but

955
00:51:39,130 --> 00:51:42,609
are they don't have the energy trenches
us or experience

956
00:51:42,609 --> 00:51:47,390
that that maybe would be necessary and
the key thing there is there's a

957
00:51:47,390 --> 00:51:50,890
arm this sort of human values aspect

958
00:51:50,890 --> 00:51:55,109
and so your values are not pretty well
aligned in the leadership

959
00:51:55,109 --> 00:51:59,270
then you're looking at I think barrel
you're looking at the risk

960
00:51:59,270 --> 00:52:04,040
misalignment going forward or you okay
%ah sitting in something like that

961
00:52:04,040 --> 00:52:08,950
arm okay so are some other strategies
delegate industry leadership roles on

962
00:52:08,950 --> 00:52:11,589
organizational structure some sort I
mentioned earlier

963
00:52:11,589 --> 00:52:14,640
two different approaches that have been
taken to that arm

964
00:52:14,640 --> 00:52:17,868
I'll last Aug few points here on
mitigating

965
00:52:17,869 --> 00:52:22,619
lost to identify the points that far %uh
failures is just you know what

966
00:52:22,619 --> 00:52:26,759
it's sort of like God I disaster
planning that you go to ready dot gov

967
00:52:26,759 --> 00:52:29,920
it's like okay what was our meeting
point in doing your flashlight is

968
00:52:29,920 --> 00:52:33,309
we have hundred dollars in cash or
something like that hysteria

969
00:52:33,309 --> 00:52:36,309
week's worth food yet basics or thing

970
00:52:36,309 --> 00:52:38,819
you can go through that sort of exercise
for the organization we have the

971
00:52:38,819 --> 00:52:40,790
passwords we have the bank accounts

972
00:52:40,790 --> 00:52:44,549
I do we know are who some other key
organizational players are the

973
00:52:44,549 --> 00:52:46,170
leadership your might have

974
00:52:46,170 --> 00:52:50,029
iraq weapon I'm all the the folks in the
trenches

975
00:52:50,029 --> 00:52:53,290
arm I so

976
00:52:53,290 --> 00:52:56,740
arm so fairly basic but job

977
00:52:56,740 --> 00:53:00,890
but sometimes difficult yet fact and
also they said

978
00:53:00,890 --> 00:53:04,960
something that on in my experience look
in some ways project

979
00:53:04,960 --> 00:53:08,309
leader visionaries of another well
suited for

980
00:53:08,309 --> 00:53:11,339
hazardous my last to a minute or so here
so awesome

981
00:53:11,339 --> 00:53:15,808
putting thoughts that leadership happens
people are motivated arm

982
00:53:15,809 --> 00:53:19,890
a I you know put in the work and so
forth do not necessarily

983
00:53:19,890 --> 00:53:23,460
are become successful I think lot a
block lot of timing

984
00:53:23,460 --> 00:53:26,619
are we see a lot %uh the project today's

985
00:53:26,619 --> 00:53:29,930
like that name some projects you're
involved with their aware of

986
00:53:29,930 --> 00:53:33,049
that art may be all that different
projects that could have happened number

987
00:53:33,049 --> 00:53:34,009
years ago or maybe

988
00:53:34,009 --> 00:53:37,069
were founded a couple years ago are

989
00:53:37,069 --> 00:53:40,549
maybe even ten or twenty years ago but
we're quite ready

990
00:53:40,549 --> 00:53:44,200
of Maria timing block so for arm

991
00:53:44,200 --> 00:53:48,910
nevertheless the talent and hard work
and thousands usually tens of thousands

992
00:53:48,910 --> 00:53:52,399
hours after years still necessary

993
00:53:52,400 --> 00:53:55,579
arm and are well I hope is

994
00:53:55,579 --> 00:53:59,480
that that today I know that a lot of
people that want to get this thing

995
00:53:59,480 --> 00:54:00,390
started

996
00:54:00,390 --> 00:54:03,640
have some ideas talking about it for
whatever

997
00:54:03,640 --> 00:54:07,250
whatever value my insides might doubt
might have but Tom

998
00:54:07,250 --> 00:54:10,589
what I hope is that is kb some ideas
about leadership some ideas about the

999
00:54:10,589 --> 00:54:11,040
role

1000
00:54:11,040 --> 00:54:14,799
love volunteerism and and ways where

1001
00:54:14,799 --> 00:54:17,969
it is not the most important thing but
ways where if you're coming up the

1002
00:54:17,969 --> 00:54:18,520
project

1003
00:54:18,520 --> 00:54:22,060
thing and longevity the projects around
the box at the outset

1004
00:54:22,060 --> 00:54:25,719
arm and supplies stock you things think
that a question there

1005
00:54:25,719 --> 00:54:29,180
no years come in sit down our people
have questions getting this

1006
00:54:29,180 --> 00:54:32,710
these last few seconds you can yell
about you want arm

1007
00:54:32,710 --> 00:54:36,339
are just my last slight here for Zara
thought experience

1008
00:54:36,339 --> 00:54:40,040
experiments on your own think that the
counter examples that's great online

1009
00:54:40,040 --> 00:54:40,810
tonight

1010
00:54:40,810 --> 00:54:44,210
not claiming to be right and I mean
house moderation that I hope for useful

1011
00:54:44,210 --> 00:54:49,069
and I and try to identify and share the
best practices

1012
00:54:49,069 --> 00:54:54,529
for projects that are have a benevolent
dictator for life like Python or Linux

1013
00:54:54,529 --> 00:54:58,190
you know what their japan's or the case
the underlies

1014
00:54:58,190 --> 00:55:01,790
I actually don't I'm curious to know in
some of those cases arm

1015
00:55:01,790 --> 00:55:05,029
are I think that there's there's early
risk though I think the risk factors i

1016
00:55:05,029 --> 00:55:05,680
mentioned

1017
00:55:05,680 --> 00:55:09,290
are are very real those projects not
only the

1018
00:55:09,290 --> 00:55:12,290
I love love effort because what you're
talking about there's more people are

1019
00:55:12,290 --> 00:55:13,810
devoting essentially their whole

1020
00:55:13,810 --> 00:55:17,119
you know workday and more in many cases
to the

1021
00:55:17,119 --> 00:55:20,160
the effort on but also their the
visionary leader

1022
00:55:20,160 --> 00:55:24,160
and are some in some cases with I'll
inexorably

1023
00:55:24,160 --> 00:55:28,180
the on glue that binds are so many
attracting

1024
00:55:28,180 --> 00:55:32,569
factor I'm very curious to know if
someone does are again I would point to

1025
00:55:32,569 --> 00:55:35,759
I did some the ones that are not
personality driven like Apache

1026
00:55:35,759 --> 00:55:40,410
as job maybe being I direction more
longevity but even then I think that's

1027
00:55:40,410 --> 00:55:41,509
an open question

1028
00:55:41,509 --> 00:55:46,279
that that occurs I think about me and my
i time I apologize I

1029
00:55:46,279 --> 00:55:48,839
know people might have a few other
questions but it incurs you step up

1030
00:55:48,839 --> 00:55:49,540
earlier

1031
00:55:49,540 --> 00:55:54,060
on so are some around you see me more
aware through today so these

1032
00:55:54,060 --> 00:55:57,549
by and I love to talk about this up in
any manner detail I'm

1033
00:55:57,549 --> 00:56:01,190
very good with the email very good I get
a little behind with

1034
00:56:01,190 --> 00:56:04,520
with being at the conference all weekend
please get in touch questions ideas

1035
00:56:04,520 --> 00:56:05,359
whatever

1036
00:56:05,359 --> 00:56:08,960
I I think with the hacking by my email
address

1037
00:56:08,960 --> 00:56:12,849
Pascal .org I've been burned out work

started

1043
00:56:27,650 --> 00:56:30,690
your own project is incredibly important

I think they make the world go around I
think they're going to shape our future

1045
00:56:34,069 --> 00:56:38,660
and I and and stick with it

1046
