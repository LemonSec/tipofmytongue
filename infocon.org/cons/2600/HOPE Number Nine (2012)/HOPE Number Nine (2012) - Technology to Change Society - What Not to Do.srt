1
00:00:00,429 --> 00:00:05,230
good morning welcome to hope number nine

2
00:00:05,230 --> 00:00:09,330
but I did he just got out somebody will
hear the previous talkers Balakrishnan

3
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:13,440
by town wow perhaps this is a this is
greater

4
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:18,020
i cant Saxena shit home so I'm

5
00:00:18,020 --> 00:00:21,900
I can't believe I'm doing this raging
years but down so much hundreds and

6
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:22,900
hundreds of the talks

7
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:26,180
panels conveying a really interesting
information

8
00:00:26,180 --> 00:00:29,929
how many people here think a technology
has changed his ID

9
00:00:29,929 --> 00:00:35,480
I okay I how many people think I summer
that is for good

10
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:38,930
and summer that hasn't worked out so
well alright

11
00:00:38,930 --> 00:00:44,500
route we're all a motive is here are
hackers or containers I'll taggers

12
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:47,690
and we're on a position to help shape
our

13
00:00:47,690 --> 00:00:51,250
that turns out I'm technology is a
double-edged sword

14
00:00:51,250 --> 00:00:55,360
and we all have an opportunity tune drag
things

15
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:58,930
so that the technology issues in ways
that will %ah

16
00:00:58,930 --> 00:01:02,899
be beneficial to society as opposed to
not good

17
00:01:02,899 --> 00:01:06,259
so a lot be subject to talk about that
and our

18
00:01:06,259 --> 00:01:09,340
what the opportunities are and what we
can do it and I'm money produce Chris

19
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:10,069
Anderson

20
00:01:10,069 --> 00:01:15,039
Gus Andrews Naturino

21
00:01:15,039 --> 00:01:18,050
and Christina done by Hester

22
00:01:18,050 --> 00:01:21,280
Raleigh all really up on this topic and
now

23
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:24,490
I wanna wish them luck take it away

24
00:01:24,490 --> 00:01:29,419
just I had my first I we're gonna
probably a reason in the top and Mail

25
00:01:29,420 --> 00:01:30,200
something all

26
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:33,349
after inside the %um kids get off a
long-handled ex-mayor realizing a

27
00:01:33,349 --> 00:01:34,539
handful of us have been

28
00:01:34,539 --> 00:01:37,729
y de use technology to change society
for the longest time

29
00:01:37,729 --> 00:01:41,750
and a half are gathered some experience
have been yelled at by even older people

30
00:01:41,750 --> 00:01:43,830
so we're sharing all the yelling at
we've had

31
00:01:43,830 --> 00:01:47,130
with you good morning christians up
first

32
00:01:47,130 --> 00:01:54,130
thanks below

33
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:58,890
good morning arm and I have a lot of
time so I'm gonna speak

34
00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:02,300
pretty on informally and move

35
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:05,640
from I very Turner

36
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:09,020
philosophical two more practical

37
00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:12,239
I and the spectrum and also on

38
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:15,660
specific and generalities are all in
here arm

39
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:19,230
and enforcement because the time I'm
sacrificing to meet the specific but

40
00:02:19,230 --> 00:02:20,149
basically what

41
00:02:20,150 --> 00:02:23,200
I wanted us to think about on

42
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:27,510
with the topic have how to use
technology to change society is the

43
00:02:27,510 --> 00:02:28,019
topic

44
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:31,260
have failure arm and

45
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:34,950
and also its corollary success and are

46
00:02:34,950 --> 00:02:38,720
basically what I'm arguing is that both
these

47
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:42,140
are more complicated than they might
mark and

48
00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:46,580
what we have to think about specifically
is whether or not the technology itself

49
00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:50,770
works is definitely not the only
question that we have to think about

50
00:02:50,770 --> 00:02:54,170
on and I'm gonna give a couple examples
in brief

51
00:02:54,170 --> 00:02:59,140
on which happened to both be ot
technology projects

52
00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:02,650
that were I imported into

53
00:03:02,650 --> 00:03:06,860
East Africa by Western activists and
designers

54
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:10,510
on but neither them that wasn't an
empire from them

55
00:03:10,510 --> 00:03:15,459
are specific to a context like East
Africa or even a global South Global

56
00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:15,950
North

57
00:03:15,950 --> 00:03:19,420
transfer on so one was a radio state Sen

58
00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:23,330
%ah this was actually philadelphia-based
activists who built

59
00:03:23,330 --> 00:03:26,640
arena season in Tanzania name built in
partnership

60
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:30,950
with a community center are led by
former

61
00:03:30,950 --> 00:03:34,400
I expat Black Panthers who had been
based in the US and

62
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:37,790
have been living in Tanzania for are
over 30 years and have a community

63
00:03:37,790 --> 00:03:38,540
center

64
00:03:38,540 --> 00:03:43,019
and so the us-based actress might tend
to me and baseband

65
00:03:43,020 --> 00:03:46,900
a mime are hanging out having all these
workshops about

66
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:50,930
our programming your sis and I and
governments have your state Sen

67
00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:54,110
and also on very nitty-gritty

68
00:03:54,110 --> 00:03:57,349
you know how to operate a transmitter
where to put your antenna

69
00:03:57,349 --> 00:04:00,990
all this stuff and then may they left
fully confident

70
00:04:00,990 --> 00:04:06,090
that've tanzanian folks had what they
needed to run the radio station

71
00:04:06,090 --> 00:04:10,849
but arm monster restart basically the

72
00:04:10,849 --> 00:04:14,750
radio station want to be run as any
not-for-profit community season

73
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:18,519
this is a mistake on tax that was
shifting out are basically

74
00:04:18,519 --> 00:04:22,850
are state-controlled socialist media and
starting to open after

75
00:04:22,850 --> 00:04:26,320
mom a more market-based model but really
didn't have a template for understanding

76
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:27,250
community radio

77
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:30,690
and didn't have a system in place for
licensing

78
00:04:30,690 --> 00:04:33,840
answers community turbine to the
government and said how do we get a

79
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:37,169
license we want to broadcast we don't
want to be breaking laws

80
00:04:37,169 --> 00:04:40,490
but there certainly isn't illegal
framework for us to fit into you

81
00:04:40,490 --> 00:04:43,500
any kind of stalled and on

82
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:47,110
so for years in fact later the season
wasn't

83
00:04:47,110 --> 00:04:51,669
it works it was operational that
broadcast on a test basis for a while

84
00:04:51,669 --> 00:04:54,789
but it wasn't working it wasn't running
om

85
00:04:54,790 --> 00:04:57,830
and so my second example is in rwanda
this is again

86
00:04:57,830 --> 00:05:01,800
our Western UK and US based designers

87
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:07,080
who I were in rwanda and we're talking
as Michael folks about what but would be

88
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:10,300
assertive lightweight useful technical
tool

89
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:13,680
that would be useful over here and what
they settled on

90
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:17,030
was something called an or a wiki on

91
00:05:17,030 --> 00:05:20,740
and this is really great if you google
or a wiki you can find are the prototype

92
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:22,270
inside that explain it

93
00:05:22,270 --> 00:05:25,570
in more detail but I'll be able to get
into but basically what this says

94
00:05:25,570 --> 00:05:28,639
is it was moving our traditional form

95
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:32,290
are mediation %ah that had

96
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:37,350
I exist in a society for a long time
this role our people called buoyancy

97
00:05:37,350 --> 00:05:41,199
who are if you're having a dispute with
your neighbor on

98
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:44,230
may be over land use our incentive

99
00:05:44,230 --> 00:05:47,440
if you can get me we're trying to work
it out with your neighbor like

100
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:50,300
you know I've been farming this piece of
land as to get the proper term many

101
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:52,940
neighbors like well no actually this
piece of land is mine and you don't have

102
00:05:52,940 --> 00:05:54,419
a clear way to work this out

103
00:05:54,419 --> 00:05:58,310
eagerly this person who's wrong the
community is me it is disputed

104
00:05:58,310 --> 00:06:02,280
but the Lindsay who works informally

105
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:05,770
and didn't really mass with the form a
government and laws

106
00:06:05,770 --> 00:06:09,070
of rwanda other there was beginning to
be a move towards

107
00:06:09,070 --> 00:06:13,400
incorporating those two systems arm
something that they told these designers

108
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:15,130
was hard for them in their work

109
00:06:15,130 --> 00:06:18,780
was that day we're keeping other records
by hand

110
00:06:18,780 --> 00:06:22,350
and they weren't arm able to travel very
often and meet with

111
00:06:22,350 --> 00:06:25,729
happens in other communities so there
was I concern that

112
00:06:25,729 --> 00:06:30,130
any decision was highly local and that
that local folks making

113
00:06:30,130 --> 00:06:33,490
on these indications didn't have the
benefit of the sort well

114
00:06:33,490 --> 00:06:36,590
are the other people in essentially this
role

115
00:06:36,590 --> 00:06:40,419
to compare with and to the designers
wound up on building a mobile

116
00:06:40,419 --> 00:06:41,620
phone-based

117
00:06:41,620 --> 00:06:45,669
Arora wiki so you can call in you could
record a decision

118
00:06:45,669 --> 00:06:49,560
that you had made are both citizens and
other brands you can call in and listen

119
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:50,449
to it

120
00:06:50,449 --> 00:06:53,729
and the idea was that this would turn
give distribute and

121
00:06:53,729 --> 00:06:57,020
crowds are city well wisdom over the

122
00:06:57,020 --> 00:07:01,799
arm basically adjudication and some
these disputes and make it more

123
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:06,570
on transparent and also maybe mark
equitable so that you know that the same

124
00:07:06,570 --> 00:07:09,090
certain decisions and you know the
northeastern for the country in the

125
00:07:09,090 --> 00:07:10,389
central part of the country

126
00:07:10,389 --> 00:07:14,259
you know that there was some are pair
parallel are symmetry

127
00:07:14,259 --> 00:07:18,210
between how these things are being
handled but lo and behold

128
00:07:18,210 --> 00:07:21,350
they build a working prototype 70
excited about it

129
00:07:21,350 --> 00:07:25,169
our local regulatory your government has
was excited about it

130
00:07:25,169 --> 00:07:28,359
but they're trying to ram it up in
actually

131
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:32,220
go beyond the prototype stage and it's
really hard to get approval

132
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:35,830
on and so again it's as working
technical artifact

133
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:40,000
but it kinda have languages and I want
say that it completely failed but it did

134
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,090
fail to advance to the next stage

135
00:07:42,090 --> 00:07:45,790
and so I think with these examples can
tell us on

136
00:07:45,790 --> 00:07:50,199
is that while both these projects were
successful technically they are also

137
00:07:50,199 --> 00:07:51,729
failures in the sense that they weren't

138
00:07:51,729 --> 00:07:56,560
implemented in the way that the
designers and users intended them to be

139
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:00,960
and so on I want to point out that this
is kind of different

140
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:04,120
than some cases where activists are
designers

141
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:08,280
have an idea are hackers have an idea
like who the school would be really

142
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:08,690
great

143
00:08:08,690 --> 00:08:13,180
and use or have builded and think out
now build it they will come and nobody

144
00:08:13,180 --> 00:08:13,669
does

145
00:08:13,669 --> 00:08:16,990
in this case actually the people who
were the intended arm

146
00:08:16,990 --> 00:08:20,419
users were highly involved in
collaborating to design

147
00:08:20,419 --> 00:08:25,580
the 20 and so it wasn't as I K-seven
mismatch between

148
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:28,859
arm the builders and the user's

149
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:32,320
I and in fact even on

150
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:35,419
certain and CEO and regulatory people
were on board with these and yet they

151
00:08:35,419 --> 00:08:37,019
still kinda languished

152
00:08:37,019 --> 00:08:40,619
on so in and thinking about how to make
sense of this

153
00:08:40,619 --> 00:08:44,350
when I one are you is that we want think
I a bit more expansively about what the

154
00:08:44,350 --> 00:08:45,679
technology itself

155
00:08:45,679 --> 00:08:48,720
is on and

156
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:51,999
basically whether or not a technology
works in a given setting

157
00:08:51,999 --> 00:08:56,410
is not restricted to I'm the narrowing
down at artifact

158
00:08:56,410 --> 00:09:00,589
and its material properties like does
you know can we plug listen

159
00:09:00,589 --> 00:09:03,660
can we work out the bugs in the software
so that the

160
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:07,589
wiki works the way that we hope it does
because all about totally worked

161
00:09:07,589 --> 00:09:11,389
also I want to point out is that when we
think about technology working

162
00:09:11,389 --> 00:09:15,179
what we're actually also assuming as a
knit successfully

163
00:09:15,179 --> 00:09:18,639
on unmatched basically n

164
00:09:18,639 --> 00:09:22,509
a set of social relations that also
account for its working not just the

165
00:09:22,509 --> 00:09:23,759
technical properties

166
00:09:23,759 --> 00:09:28,160
and on really crucially this is really
invisible to us

167
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:32,439
with technology is that work on when
everything's in working order

168
00:09:32,439 --> 00:09:36,099
its a lot easier to on bracket out

169
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:40,929
all the forces that go into the working
right this is absurd a classic problem

170
00:09:40,929 --> 00:09:45,300
on where you don't notice like this
elevator I can add to the 18th floor

171
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:48,790
on I would really only pay attention to
it if it weren't working I was taking 18

172
00:09:48,790 --> 00:09:50,269
flights of stairs right

173
00:09:50,269 --> 00:09:54,369
on and so I mean we talk about

174
00:09:54,369 --> 00:09:58,149
what the technology is we wind up kinda
unfolding

175
00:09:58,149 --> 00:10:01,369
all these points a contact with the
social world

176
00:10:01,369 --> 00:10:04,589
into you now the radio station works

177
00:10:04,589 --> 00:10:07,660
right on so I just really wanna make

178
00:10:07,660 --> 00:10:11,238
%ah basically an and intervention how we
think

179
00:10:11,239 --> 00:10:14,389
about wanna technology is on

180
00:10:14,389 --> 00:10:17,829
and of her critique here and say that we
need to you

181
00:10:17,829 --> 00:10:21,459
arm take a marksman to deliver artifacts
are

182
00:10:21,459 --> 00:10:25,709
and specifically when we're thinking
about it the project might work

183
00:10:25,709 --> 00:10:28,589
out we have to think about where it
touches all these obvious places

184
00:10:28,589 --> 00:10:29,509
including

185
00:10:29,509 --> 00:10:33,100
users including institutions including

186
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:36,129
our legal frameworks and regulatory
frameworks

187
00:10:36,129 --> 00:10:39,420
on and if it's gonna touch those it
doesn't mean you have to necessarily

188
00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:41,110
build something that will

189
00:10:41,110 --> 00:10:44,689
completely on and seamlessly matched
with them

190
00:10:44,689 --> 00:10:47,689
in fact you might be wanting to build
something that

191
00:10:47,689 --> 00:10:50,709
is going to disrupts

192
00:10:50,709 --> 00:10:54,179
or in other ways arm certain mass where

193
00:10:54,179 --> 00:10:57,999
the the system that's out there but you
have to be thinking about it right

194
00:10:57,999 --> 00:11:01,949
and in particular if you're going to be
building something that doesn't

195
00:11:01,949 --> 00:11:05,720
on necessarily seem like it's gonna work
at the place where it touches

196
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:09,499
I just a very very practical idea is be
prepared to talk about this

197
00:11:09,499 --> 00:11:12,929
be prepared to explain the project may
be prepared to explain it

198
00:11:12,929 --> 00:11:16,429
in different ways to different audiences
and sorted translated

199
00:11:16,429 --> 00:11:20,100
I'm not gonna say lie but say what you
need to say

200
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:24,199
to on the people who need to hear it and
I don't mean that in a

201
00:11:24,199 --> 00:11:27,649
and assorted patronizing way but if
we're thinking a

202
00:11:27,649 --> 00:11:32,149
you now greasing the skids to get a
project to work and that a fail

203
00:11:32,149 --> 00:11:36,809
are basically we need to think about
white would constitute success

204
00:11:36,809 --> 00:11:40,910
arm and a whole bunch of different
levels not just the sort of micro

205
00:11:40,910 --> 00:11:44,429
on out whether or not this yr artifact
itself is in working order and has the

206
00:11:44,429 --> 00:11:45,399
bugs worked out

207
00:11:45,399 --> 00:11:48,970
and not even again asserted micro are
whether or not

208
00:11:48,970 --> 00:11:52,730
artifact works and the people who want
to use it you know why is that the way

209
00:11:52,730 --> 00:11:53,410
you built in

210
00:11:53,410 --> 00:11:56,459
because again in these cases all that
works fine

211
00:11:56,459 --> 00:12:00,329
and yet these projects have died on the
vine so we backed

212
00:12:00,329 --> 00:12:03,949
cautionary tale and how much time I turn
I think that's about it perfect okay

213
00:12:03,949 --> 00:12:10,949
great thank you on way

214
00:12:14,340 --> 00:12:14,750
lol

215
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:18,610
breaker on so

216
00:12:18,610 --> 00:12:23,340
this talk and is going to be a
reflection on my own experience

217
00:12:23,340 --> 00:12:26,550
on in a project I tried to use
technology to change the world

218
00:12:26,550 --> 00:12:30,060
I'm in the memories of my experience
with that project on have sorted and

219
00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:33,170
filtered through academic research that
I did after I

220
00:12:33,170 --> 00:12:36,400
was done on so sorta mashina personal

221
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:40,720
and on stuff up thought about as a as a
researcher and as a as a grad student

222
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:42,230
and now is a Professor

223
00:12:42,230 --> 00:12:46,340
on the organization I want to talk about
was called The Independent Media Center

224
00:12:46,340 --> 00:12:51,010
Obama also called in the media are the I
am see how many people here have ever

225
00:12:51,010 --> 00:12:51,510
heard

226
00:12:51,510 --> 00:12:54,860
independent media high-tech so if you
have I'm

227
00:12:54,860 --> 00:12:58,620
on the less then on I would maybe have
thought at a conference like this so

228
00:12:58,620 --> 00:13:00,030
this is this is actually good n

229
00:13:00,030 --> 00:13:05,220
and Hisense what I'm gonna talk about on
the title is panel a somewhat in the

230
00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:08,240
media was because if you don't know
where we're in the media is

231
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:11,450
it's a complicated thing because it's
actually still around on

232
00:13:11,450 --> 00:13:15,150
but not really operating in the way that
it used to

233
00:13:15,150 --> 00:13:18,750
I'm what anybody was very quickly was
that it served

234
00:13:18,750 --> 00:13:23,210
as one of the world's and I say world
because it really was a global thing

235
00:13:23,210 --> 00:13:26,360
I love the world's first citizen
journalism organizations

236
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:29,780
although we didn't call it at the time
there was no concept no one had claimed

237
00:13:29,780 --> 00:13:30,339
that

238
00:13:30,340 --> 00:13:33,700
that's too bad phrase yet citizen
journalism um

239
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:37,760
what we said we did was we said we
allowed ordinary people to provide their

240
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:38,990
own media coverage

241
00:13:38,990 --> 00:13:43,180
I'll protest offense and political on
things they were trying to do

242
00:13:43,180 --> 00:13:47,030
and actually cover themselves because
the mainstream media wouldn't have them

243
00:13:47,030 --> 00:13:50,400
properly on this is something we now
call citizen journalism

244
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:54,860
on and it was very important
particularly during protests

245
00:13:54,860 --> 00:14:00,080
on pride Occupy Wall Street that sort
previous waiver I love

246
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:04,120
have radical protest in United States
were center and something called the

247
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:08,530
the and once the anti-globalization
movement but the anti-corporate

248
00:14:08,530 --> 00:14:10,780
globalization movement whatever you want
to call it

249
00:14:10,780 --> 00:14:14,610
and in the media grew out of that
movement it then tied into a lot of the

250
00:14:14,610 --> 00:14:17,580
anti-war protests are going on in 2003

251
00:14:17,580 --> 00:14:20,740
2004 I'm okay summer

252
00:14:20,740 --> 00:14:24,150
on this talk I wanna give

253
00:14:24,150 --> 00:14:27,439
is a story of failure to success on

254
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:31,670
and what I mean by failure to success is
that the technology and the

255
00:14:31,670 --> 00:14:33,160
technological methods

256
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:36,670
that in the media pioneered actually
went mainstream

257
00:14:36,670 --> 00:14:39,830
I'm beings like

258
00:14:39,830 --> 00:14:43,900
tax updates from protests that we're now
treated as journalism

259
00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:48,010
ordinary people sending their thoughts
and their feelings up in ways that are

260
00:14:48,010 --> 00:14:51,580
aggregated collected by traditional
mainstream news organizations

261
00:14:51,580 --> 00:14:55,350
a pop-up newsrooms right newsrooms that
appear and disappear

262
00:14:55,350 --> 00:14:59,550
arm around particular offense arm
decentralize coverage

263
00:14:59,550 --> 00:15:02,970
other dams filtered through the
aggregation have different perspectives

264
00:15:02,970 --> 00:15:07,550
on blogging sorted people taking this
idea that you know I'm going to reflect

265
00:15:07,550 --> 00:15:10,830
on you now have my own participation in
this event

266
00:15:10,830 --> 00:15:16,330
I'm all these have become absorbs into
the general population but particularly

267
00:15:16,330 --> 00:15:20,470
into the mainstream media ecosystem if
you listen to what the traditional media

268
00:15:20,470 --> 00:15:21,620
is talking about now

269
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:24,660
this is all they're talking about this
sort of thing

270
00:15:24,660 --> 00:15:29,260
dominates what news organizations in
2012 think they have to do in order to

271
00:15:29,260 --> 00:15:30,020
be relevant

272
00:15:30,020 --> 00:15:35,180
and serve up %uh and I don't think it's
hubris check and I don't think it's an

273
00:15:35,180 --> 00:15:36,480
exaggeration to say

274
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:39,980
that when it comes to the force is
currently shaking the world a journalism

275
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:43,290
each of them has grappled with by an
activist media organization

276
00:15:43,290 --> 00:15:46,719
in the late 1990s and early 2000's I'm

277
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:50,100
so real briefly i want to talk about
what in the media did in a particular

278
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:50,670
moment

279
00:15:50,670 --> 00:15:56,430
2003 to 2004 alman journalists were
working on building a media center that

280
00:15:56,430 --> 00:16:00,070
could cover the Republican National
Convention in New York but remember that

281
00:16:00,070 --> 00:16:03,200
fun time republican national convention
here gas

282
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:08,390
%uh those were the days I'm so in the
early days in the media

283
00:16:08,390 --> 00:16:12,400
and coverage protest coverage the the
citizen journalism methods are actually

284
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:13,240
pretty simple

285
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:17,560
someone told me and this is a quote I'm
pretty sure we distributed a high volume

286
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:19,280
of paper cards

287
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:22,370
to would-be protesters saying call this
phone number

288
00:16:22,370 --> 00:16:25,670
if you have information about something
that happened in the protest and then we

289
00:16:25,670 --> 00:16:26,920
had people singing buyer

290
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:30,100
found typing up reports that would come
in over the phone and then we would

291
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:32,440
actually enter that into the breaking
news wire

292
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:36,110
our website I'm and and this was a new
thing then

293
00:16:36,110 --> 00:16:39,890
on this was not not traditionally done

294
00:16:39,890 --> 00:16:43,760
outs away the in the media website was
set up was that you had a right hand

295
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:45,120
column which was sorta

296
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:48,830
called open newswire which was
individual submissions from anybody

297
00:16:48,830 --> 00:16:50,040
about something to report

298
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:53,180
up photo to upload a story to share you
then had

299
00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:56,300
a breaking news box at the top would be
sort of

300
00:16:56,300 --> 00:16:59,700
short little blurb updates on what was
going on and then you had something

301
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:01,060
called the center column

302
00:17:01,060 --> 00:17:04,280
I which was for them Henry gation love

303
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:08,670
on at everything that has been going on
the rest to the website

304
00:17:08,670 --> 00:17:12,270
please let me know about time to give me
like turn it on ok

305
00:17:12,270 --> 00:17:16,980
I'm so that was for the basic setup and
if I wanted to go to the whole hassle

306
00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:19,780
putting up slides I would show you a
slight but you basically just three

307
00:17:19,780 --> 00:17:21,560
column architecture where you had

308
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:26,119
stories moved from low verifiability to
high verifiability

309
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:31,020
right so you had disorder be the stories
were increasingly

310
00:17:31,020 --> 00:17:35,160
verified and filtered out as they moved
towards the center column

311
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:37,820
right and the ideal why'd you get all
these perspectives you get all these

312
00:17:37,820 --> 00:17:39,129
things flying in

313
00:17:39,130 --> 00:17:43,430
sorta generated in a dispersed way you
bring into the center and that's where

314
00:17:43,430 --> 00:17:46,430
they're most verified inaccurate
information

315
00:17:46,430 --> 00:17:50,760
I'm so during the Republican National
Convention though

316
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:53,770
%uh there was also an additional source
of information something hot

317
00:17:53,770 --> 00:17:56,990
text moms as anyone here ever heard

318
00:17:56,990 --> 00:18:01,250
text moms okay one to 3 couple people
aren't good

319
00:18:01,250 --> 00:18:05,090
on tax mobs I this was sorta

320
00:18:05,090 --> 00:18:08,669
what they said about tax mobs in a in a
press release they said it

321
00:18:08,670 --> 00:18:11,860
text mobs were Qatar

322
00:18:11,860 --> 00:18:16,180
AV though were equipped with a wire
whisk and protesters were quick to the

323
00:18:16,180 --> 00:18:16,810
wireless

324
00:18:16,810 --> 00:18:21,020
tactical communications device connected
to a distributed information service

325
00:18:21,020 --> 00:18:24,710
that provided detailed and nearly
instantaneous apps updates

326
00:18:24,710 --> 00:18:28,030
about route changes street closures and
what police were doing

327
00:18:28,030 --> 00:18:32,090
the communications device was a cell
phone I and the information service

328
00:18:32,090 --> 00:18:35,860
a collection open source web-based
programming scripts running I'll xserver

329
00:18:35,860 --> 00:18:37,070
in someone's closet

330
00:18:37,070 --> 00:18:41,629
was called text mom on text my was
basically an elaboration a previous

331
00:18:41,630 --> 00:18:44,710
flash mob technology that had been used
to coordinate

332
00:18:44,710 --> 00:18:48,540
loosely structured relatively autonomous
political and social dance

333
00:18:48,540 --> 00:18:52,620
even before the IMC I'm so basically
what it did was the service allowed you

334
00:18:52,620 --> 00:18:53,010
just

335
00:18:53,010 --> 00:18:57,280
users to register with various protest
oriented message group

336
00:18:57,280 --> 00:19:01,550
and receive and send mass text messages
to members of that group

337
00:19:01,550 --> 00:19:05,510
buyer there somehow writes Ian sign up
for a group if you want to send a

338
00:19:05,510 --> 00:19:08,879
anonymous message you could send it out
over your cell phone

339
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:12,380
it would then be received by the group
right very useful for things like

340
00:19:12,380 --> 00:19:16,330
helicopter closing off Broadway let's go
sixth Avenue instead

341
00:19:16,330 --> 00:19:19,939
right I'm at the same time

342
00:19:19,940 --> 00:19:24,470
I M journalist with in the medium
monitored text mobs as

343
00:19:24,470 --> 00:19:27,950
information source that they would use
to produce journalism and they use their

344
00:19:27,950 --> 00:19:29,460
own tax moms group

345
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:33,510
as an additional way to distribute news
and a supplemental service launched just

346
00:19:33,510 --> 00:19:34,150
before the

347
00:19:34,150 --> 00:19:38,030
Republican National Convention even
translated these tax updates

348
00:19:38,030 --> 00:19:41,560
in the human speech that you could
listen to you by calling a telephone

349
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:43,550
number this was a great

350
00:19:43,550 --> 00:19:46,810
I'm okay wrapping up quickly now on

351
00:19:46,810 --> 00:19:49,770
you may be thinking this sounds a lot
like a technology that people currently

352
00:19:49,770 --> 00:19:51,379
use around protests any

353
00:19:51,380 --> 00:19:54,500
guesses on what that is Twitter right
yes

354
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:57,940
Twitter I'm allotted you might be
thinking hey that sounds like Twitter

355
00:19:57,940 --> 00:19:59,630
and a lot of you might also be thinking

356
00:19:59,630 --> 00:20:04,390
wow thats what a remarkable coincidence
and the thing is it's not a coincidence

357
00:20:04,390 --> 00:20:08,840
I'm tax mob was actually one love many
not not the only one

358
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:12,770
on it's important to say the one of
several open source projects

359
00:20:12,770 --> 00:20:16,110
that the founders of Twitter were
hacking on when they invented square

360
00:20:16,110 --> 00:20:17,570
while working in a company called

361
00:20:17,570 --> 00:20:21,530
oh yeah I can shorten our leaders
Twitter appears similar to the

362
00:20:21,530 --> 00:20:24,879
SMS protests systems develop nearly a
decade ago

363
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:28,860
is actually the Senate that very same
software so here's the basic gist

364
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:32,360
in some ways the DNA have a small
marginalized tax project that no one

365
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:33,950
else in the world has ever heard out

366
00:20:33,950 --> 00:20:37,310
now sits within the body upon the most
powerful social messaging systems in the

367
00:20:37,310 --> 00:20:37,720
world

368
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:41,930
okay Chris houses the story valliere
write this on the historic success

369
00:20:41,930 --> 00:20:46,520
witnesses a story a failure I think is
that if you define your success in

370
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:47,950
technological terms

371
00:20:47,950 --> 00:20:51,080
you might be successful in technological
terms only

372
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:55,169
in other words in the media and people
using text mobs

373
00:20:55,170 --> 00:20:59,030
incredibly ambitious an important social
political

374
00:20:59,030 --> 00:21:03,690
economic goals that they saw technology
being in service to

375
00:21:03,690 --> 00:21:07,660
right Twitter does not have those goals
Twitter does not care about social

376
00:21:07,660 --> 00:21:10,370
justice in the way that the people who
invented text mamsted

377
00:21:10,370 --> 00:21:14,600
he did not care about economic policy in
the same it people who enter text moms

378
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:18,070
and then a text mamsted and my argument
here that you can be incredibly

379
00:21:18,070 --> 00:21:20,000
successful technologically

380
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:23,540
incredibly unsuccessful in all there is
all sorts of other ways

381
00:21:23,540 --> 00:21:27,889
and I think also discuss last thank I
think that those of you who have worked

382
00:21:27,890 --> 00:21:29,780
on free software for many years

383
00:21:29,780 --> 00:21:33,300
who have seen free software become open
source software

384
00:21:33,300 --> 00:21:38,040
become this thing that everybody does
right I think you guys know more about

385
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:41,500
this than anyone because I think that
you see this conflict

386
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:45,600
in your day-to-day working life right
what happens when this social movement

387
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:48,830
baser and technology becomes mainstream
in ways that maybe you

388
00:21:48,830 --> 00:21:53,120
have lost some the original social goals
at the technology was minister

389
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:56,920
alright so that was quick I hope it was
coherent on and happy to talk about it

390
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:57,320
more

391
00:21:57,320 --> 00:22:04,320
the Ampex well

392
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:11,910
teach ok

393
00:22:11,910 --> 00:22:16,760
you do the turn

394
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:21,220
not

395
00:22:21,220 --> 00:22:24,370
morning hackers my name is Matt
Currington

396
00:22:24,370 --> 00:22:29,029
I just finished my second year has a
professor at Adelphi University here new

397
00:22:29,029 --> 00:22:29,519
york

398
00:22:29,519 --> 00:22:32,990
by been developing a new program in
educational technology

399
00:22:32,990 --> 00:22:37,029
so I can have this idea that we can use
technology

400
00:22:37,029 --> 00:22:40,389
to change society especially in the
couple that with education

401
00:22:40,389 --> 00:22:43,950
and I've been working on this and it's
an ongoing project some action wanna

402
00:22:43,950 --> 00:22:45,630
says when Gus invited me

403
00:22:45,630 --> 00:22:49,630
to the panel about how technology fails
to change this I'm

404
00:22:49,630 --> 00:22:53,259
federal court of competent by I'm gonna
tell you about what I've been doing

405
00:22:53,259 --> 00:22:57,370
what worked what hasn't worked and some
other things have in 10 min as we go

406
00:22:57,370 --> 00:23:01,230
so I

407
00:23:01,230 --> 00:23:05,750
I think this is relevant to hope because
eventually I want this program

408
00:23:05,750 --> 00:23:09,820
can be a school for hackers and to be
some tribal impetus

409
00:23:09,820 --> 00:23:12,980
run which

410
00:23:12,980 --> 00:23:17,370
you eat eat eat occurring at a comp

411
00:23:17,370 --> 00:23:22,289
night this is a battle I lost they would
let me set up my own website

412
00:23:22,289 --> 00:23:27,080
and I'm I'm reopening that friend I gave
up on it last year

413
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:30,178
on see this is this is more interesting
than

414
00:23:30,179 --> 00:23:33,590
then the corporate site that their

415
00:23:33,590 --> 00:23:37,110
she warned me into down anyway

416
00:23:37,110 --> 00:23:41,700
a so if we go back a couple years I just
finishing my dissertation

417
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:45,519
and I was very happy day damn job offer
new york I was

418
00:23:45,519 --> 00:23:49,330
particularly happy because as governors
opportunist our new

419
00:23:49,330 --> 00:23:53,379
masters program kinda from scratch I was
the only one working on it I'd met with

420
00:23:53,379 --> 00:23:55,899
the fact be there they were happy to
have become an

421
00:23:55,899 --> 00:24:00,190
they knew the kinda stuff I did so it
seemed great and

422
00:24:00,190 --> 00:24:03,240
buyers rep the cezanne I think it's
relevant hope because

423
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:06,379
I kinda want this idea of attacking
education

424
00:24:06,379 --> 00:24:11,350
and have creating education hackers that
as organizing principle for the program

425
00:24:11,350 --> 00:24:14,789
so when I say that hackney education are

426
00:24:14,789 --> 00:24:17,879
one oppose it to maybe this idea
education reform

427
00:24:17,879 --> 00:24:23,690
you think a performance its getting
schools back on track or even like

428
00:24:23,690 --> 00:24:24,970
radical reform

429
00:24:24,970 --> 00:24:28,029
would be getting back to the first
principles for school

430
00:24:28,029 --> 00:24:32,330
whereas when I say hacking education
what I want to do is

431
00:24:32,330 --> 00:24:35,889
try to make schools do something that
they were never intended to do

432
00:24:35,889 --> 00:24:40,539
or something that most people never
imagine that they could be

433
00:24:40,539 --> 00:24:43,799
so I don't think that there's like one
big hack for this but

434
00:24:43,799 --> 00:24:46,820
weekend in need to start on

435
00:24:46,820 --> 00:24:50,570
or Delphi could be part of a movement to
get people search

436
00:24:50,570 --> 00:24:54,039
thinking this way nom your

437
00:24:54,039 --> 00:24:57,860
don't want to talk about education too
much I want to speech or presentation

438
00:24:57,860 --> 00:25:01,559
basically i think thats cool even when
they are excellent

439
00:25:01,559 --> 00:25:06,039
in succeed by by their own internal
standards that they can still be

440
00:25:06,039 --> 00:25:10,620
harmful to society and education
consider broadly so this is where I'm

441
00:25:10,620 --> 00:25:11,470
coming from

442
00:25:11,470 --> 00:25:17,179
and I started Delphi and I i laid out my
guiding principles for what I wanted

443
00:25:17,179 --> 00:25:17,750
these

444
00:25:17,750 --> 00:25:21,919
my students to be able to do so these
are people interested in education

445
00:25:21,919 --> 00:25:25,019
interest in technology I'm the

446
00:25:25,019 --> 00:25:30,169
for saying was there I wanted to be all
hands-on project-based learning that

447
00:25:30,169 --> 00:25:31,730
they be building things that they'd

448
00:25:31,730 --> 00:25:34,830
produce for the world in some meaningful
way I'm

449
00:25:34,830 --> 00:25:38,158
second I wanted them to have hands-on
skills for technology

450
00:25:38,159 --> 00:25:41,260
on everyone to learn to write software I
wanted one

451
00:25:41,260 --> 00:25:44,639
to learn we will set up a network to
edit video too

452
00:25:44,639 --> 00:25:47,990
at least when they were students here
that they'd have the skills so that when

453
00:25:47,990 --> 00:25:48,549
they left

454
00:25:48,549 --> 00:25:51,350
they wouldn't be afraid of technology
and they be confident they can learn

455
00:25:51,350 --> 00:25:52,450
things on their own

456
00:25:52,450 --> 00:25:55,850
now the third thing there was important
to me

457
00:25:55,850 --> 00:25:59,210
was that they had some background in
theory and philosophy

458
00:25:59,210 --> 00:26:02,309
so that they wouldn't fall in two sum
these the straps that they have a

459
00:26:02,309 --> 00:26:04,700
prospective beyond just the technology
or

460
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:09,720
beyond just education in them my idea
for this would be that the whole program

461
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:14,110
will be run around the lab in this lab
is kinda my vision a paradise

462
00:26:14,110 --> 00:26:18,580
a you coming to lab in fact in students
who work together they'd

463
00:26:18,580 --> 00:26:22,320
good right Freese offer for education
they contribute other projects aim I

464
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:23,689
built a multimedia

465
00:26:23,690 --> 00:26:27,419
the kinda set their own agenda and they
work together and study as a wine

466
00:26:27,419 --> 00:26:31,519
and it would be kinda hard they go out
to the community spread the ideas

467
00:26:31,519 --> 00:26:35,259
know along with the lab we would have
seminar where as a group we would decide

468
00:26:35,259 --> 00:26:36,570
what we want to read

469
00:26:36,570 --> 00:26:40,090
we needed we talk about it we'd write
about it and again

470
00:26:40,090 --> 00:26:43,510
this focus on getting ideas out into the
world

471
00:26:43,510 --> 00:26:48,158
night so when I first started I A for
this idea briefly

472
00:26:48,159 --> 00:26:51,830
even had a worker's an acronym for the
lab it but

473
00:26:51,830 --> 00:26:54,960
clearly wasn't going to fly

474
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:59,070
so broke up lab in seminar in the
fifteen courses

475
00:26:59,070 --> 00:27:02,629
and I created fifteen new cell by I
wrote in all the smart people I knew to

476
00:27:02,629 --> 00:27:03,149
help me

477
00:27:03,149 --> 00:27:06,159
Gus now on these courses

478
00:27:06,159 --> 00:27:09,889
and I finishes in about two months at
work hard and then

479
00:27:09,889 --> 00:27:13,940
this is where I hit bureaucracy

480
00:27:13,940 --> 00:27:17,909
so I was going to make a flow chart
outlining the process

481
00:27:17,909 --> 00:27:22,519
love how to get a new program approved
but is pretty much mostly Santa possibly

482
00:27:22,519 --> 00:27:25,460
think you're doing is today

483
00:27:25,460 --> 00:27:29,200
so I'm just gonna tell you how I how I
remembered best

484
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:33,659
it's about ten steps in first need
approval from YouTube department chair

485
00:27:33,659 --> 00:27:37,320
the school education be in the Provost
office to begin working on

486
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:40,340
then your department fact the vote on it
some in a

487
00:27:40,340 --> 00:27:44,419
army department called curriculum
instruction

488
00:27:44,419 --> 00:27:48,000
right next I'm

489
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:51,039
the school education has a a committee

490
00:27:51,039 --> 00:27:54,399
that reviews in this is about a hundred
fifty-page document that

491
00:27:54,399 --> 00:27:57,760
that these different groups are working
with to the committee looks at it

492
00:27:57,760 --> 00:28:02,750
and they prove you're not once a preview
your the whole school education vote as

493
00:28:02,750 --> 00:28:03,609
a faculty

494
00:28:03,609 --> 00:28:06,869
in Needham I think it's simple majority
to move forward

495
00:28:06,869 --> 00:28:11,210
next it goes on to university-wide
academic affairs committee that does the

496
00:28:11,210 --> 00:28:14,429
same thing that the school that academic
affairs committee justed

497
00:28:14,429 --> 00:28:18,820
I and then there's a fact the Senate the
represents University books on it

498
00:28:18,820 --> 00:28:21,820
from there the Dena Beliebers approves
it

499
00:28:21,820 --> 00:28:25,399
or maybe he approves it before the
Senate measure

500
00:28:25,399 --> 00:28:30,149
next it goes to the Board of Trustees
and at that point your lead the senate

501
00:28:30,149 --> 00:28:31,369
in York State

502
00:28:31,369 --> 00:28:35,340
in the nave prove it in I don't know
what they do

503
00:28:35,340 --> 00:28:39,549
on yeah I was told it was unknown amount
of time in an unknown process

504
00:28:39,549 --> 00:28:42,980
and we were just send it to them and see
what happen so the

505
00:28:42,980 --> 00:28:46,779
problem it doesn't seem too bad like I
want to finish it in the in this year

506
00:28:46,779 --> 00:28:47,260
and was

507
00:28:47,260 --> 00:28:50,740
use only the end of October when I
started except that much these groups

508
00:28:50,740 --> 00:28:52,500
only meet once a month

509
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:56,700
the border Trustees meets quarterly so

510
00:28:56,700 --> 00:29:01,700
if I didn't get approved any meeting the
whole thing would fail and base KB back

511
00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:05,369
doing the same thing again the next year
with seemed like I might quit

512
00:29:05,369 --> 00:29:09,109
in go back to writing code cell

513
00:29:09,109 --> 00:29:12,619
be basically along the way

514
00:29:12,619 --> 00:29:16,789
a runny ran into some problems I have no
I skip this cat I had to me with any

515
00:29:16,789 --> 00:29:17,529
other

516
00:29:17,529 --> 00:29:21,359
units at the university there my overlap
with me and in this case I met with

517
00:29:21,359 --> 00:29:23,720
computer science and with communications

518
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:27,510
communications were totally cool they
just said you can't use any work women

519
00:29:27,510 --> 00:29:31,859
static var laps with you that there is
OK

520
00:29:31,859 --> 00:29:35,330
computer science so wanted to steal pre
my courses and lessen his computer

521
00:29:35,330 --> 00:29:37,090
science courses

522
00:29:37,090 --> 00:29:41,299
arm which I didn't really care but then
I was told that then they would get the

523
00:29:41,299 --> 00:29:44,389
side who teaches them and they would be
able to hire new factory for computer

524
00:29:44,389 --> 00:29:45,100
science

525
00:29:45,100 --> 00:29:49,809
which would help to leave me alone is
the only factor remember my program

526
00:29:49,809 --> 00:29:53,279
in the end I settled with them gave them
one course in is able to keep too and

527
00:29:53,279 --> 00:29:54,260
I'm teaching a course

528
00:29:54,260 --> 00:29:57,549
so it's not it's not too bad

529
00:29:57,549 --> 00:30:01,269
and other one my academic affairs at
school bed

530
00:30:01,269 --> 00:30:05,470
maybe add five paragraphs to each of the
15 courses

531
00:30:05,470 --> 00:30:08,869
about these distribution requirements
the university has I had to do this

532
00:30:08,869 --> 00:30:12,629
basically overnight before I met with
the university-wide committee

533
00:30:12,629 --> 00:30:16,730
and then that committee may be removed
the mall because they didn't want

534
00:30:16,730 --> 00:30:19,869
undergraduate students taking graduate
courses to fulfill these requirements

535
00:30:19,869 --> 00:30:21,740
they want to protect their

536
00:30:21,740 --> 00:30:25,440
enrollment on in the end

537
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:29,220
New York State approved two master's
degrees one in educational technology

538
00:30:29,220 --> 00:30:31,970
that leads to a teaching certificate

539
00:30:31,970 --> 00:30:35,710
and one that's more educational design
in the

540
00:30:35,710 --> 00:30:40,529
approved a graduate level certification
technologies Robin education

541
00:30:40,529 --> 00:30:44,510
so yes like

542
00:30:44,510 --> 00:30:48,369
don't speaker not well

543
00:30:48,369 --> 00:30:52,549
what happened now is that at the end it
look like

544
00:30:52,549 --> 00:30:56,520
a good but pretty much any other
graduate degree

545
00:30:56,520 --> 00:31:01,700
in this area in the country and really
wasn't why I'd set out to do it's now

546
00:31:01,700 --> 00:31:05,399
my vision about higher education should
look like it's not really my vision and

547
00:31:05,399 --> 00:31:07,210
what we should be

548
00:31:07,210 --> 00:31:10,559
are the best way to educate these this
teacher so and taken

549
00:31:10,559 --> 00:31:14,379
step back in kind look at where

550
00:31:14,379 --> 00:31:17,369
how things worked out where succeeded
where things get knocked off track in

551
00:31:17,369 --> 00:31:18,929
bed

552
00:31:18,929 --> 00:31:21,940
one to okay

553
00:31:21,940 --> 00:31:25,179
so basically everything that happens

554
00:31:25,179 --> 00:31:28,490
is depends on how many allies you have
with you

555
00:31:28,490 --> 00:31:32,250
and whether you're able to succeed or
not and really the opposition that I

556
00:31:32,250 --> 00:31:33,369
faced

557
00:31:33,369 --> 00:31:36,730
was geared around two things procedures
and standards

558
00:31:36,730 --> 00:31:40,210
nobody at the University said I think
this is a bad idea

559
00:31:40,210 --> 00:31:43,820
at any point they would say instead

560
00:31:43,820 --> 00:31:48,460
you didn't have the choir room for this
role or this wasn't presented

561
00:31:48,460 --> 00:31:53,260
in enough time for us to review it so
every time I i ran into opposition was

562
00:31:53,260 --> 00:31:55,020
on procedural grounds

563
00:31:55,020 --> 00:31:58,460
and mostly I was able to overcome this

564
00:31:58,460 --> 00:32:01,970
by having ours have my own arm

565
00:32:01,970 --> 00:32:05,619
basically I did work for people for free

566
00:32:05,619 --> 00:32:08,830
and they became my allies so I worked
with

567
00:32:08,830 --> 00:32:12,230
with anyone that need a website are
needed I'm

568
00:32:12,230 --> 00:32:16,359
you know that that kinda stuff that I
had good good skills and I was able to

569
00:32:16,359 --> 00:32:17,460
bring that to garner

570
00:32:17,460 --> 00:32:20,470
allies and more CA overcame a procedural
grounds

571
00:32:20,470 --> 00:32:25,809
the second though the standards for
something that actually stymied being

572
00:32:25,809 --> 00:32:30,059
there are two main group that actually
mandate what needs to be taught for this

573
00:32:30,059 --> 00:32:31,559
degree to be approved

574
00:32:31,559 --> 00:32:34,809
New York State has its own set of
standards and then

575
00:32:34,809 --> 00:32:41,039
this is quasi on be governmental group
that oversees

576
00:32:41,039 --> 00:32:44,679
teacher education programs called and
Kate and

577
00:32:44,679 --> 00:32:49,490
you can't grant degrees in a school
education that deadly desertification if

578
00:32:49,490 --> 00:32:51,179
NK dozen approved

579
00:32:51,179 --> 00:32:54,909
so anytime I try to do something

580
00:32:54,909 --> 00:32:58,379
in that my enemies didn't like they
would say

581
00:32:58,379 --> 00:33:01,549
I'm afraid that you're not adhering to
the standards here

582
00:33:01,549 --> 00:33:04,839
and now it's kinda like the commandment
of God if you if you don't

583
00:33:04,839 --> 00:33:08,119
the standards were something that were
beyond us and

584
00:33:08,119 --> 00:33:12,070
I had very little to success gaining
allies

585
00:33:12,070 --> 00:33:17,309
to pose a standards and

586
00:33:17,309 --> 00:33:21,720
now good I'm happy to be welcoming my
purse

587
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:27,099
class in the fall and try to launch its
website this summer

588
00:33:27,099 --> 00:33:30,668
and I've taken on wanna my new goals

589
00:33:30,669 --> 00:33:33,779
is trying to get support from outside a

590
00:33:33,779 --> 00:33:38,289
adelphi to build a movement to to kind
overthrow the standards or subvert them

591
00:33:38,289 --> 00:33:41,070
as much as I can

592
00:33:41,070 --> 00:33:47,980
well

593
00:33:47,980 --> 00:33:51,919
thanks I really am so pleased to be
presenting when this game is awesome I

594
00:33:51,919 --> 00:33:54,919
breast colleagues and my press has my
best college

595
00:33:54,919 --> 00:33:58,720
and outflow credenza I'm

596
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:04,149
so I and I was for a summer rise and I'm
put this in a broader context of

597
00:34:04,149 --> 00:34:05,629
technology and social change

598
00:34:05,629 --> 00:34:09,770
on because there I is literature out
there that is just not searching a

599
00:34:09,770 --> 00:34:13,119
thoughtful allow that I would be doing
some special about schools but I think

600
00:34:13,119 --> 00:34:17,109
just because I've what Matt was telling
us there on you all have a sense that

601
00:34:17,109 --> 00:34:20,649
that's cool stuff is really thorny and I
think a lot of us just glaze over me

602
00:34:20,649 --> 00:34:22,040
think about it sell

603
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:25,509
I know a lot of us immediately try to
make the and run up going to do

604
00:34:25,510 --> 00:34:27,490
something like OLPC and

605
00:34:27,490 --> 00:34:30,770
the reason I actually put this panel
together was a

606
00:34:30,770 --> 00:34:35,099
at some point online earlier this year I
ran into yet another young person doing

607
00:34:35,099 --> 00:34:39,069
we're gonna leave laptops for the poor
in its gonna change everything and I was

608
00:34:39,069 --> 00:34:40,710
like we've done at

609
00:34:40,710 --> 00:34:44,179
and so previously in talks on a given on

610
00:34:44,179 --> 00:34:48,060
machine I miss get a couple reside did
haven't previous stock rose like it used

611
00:34:48,060 --> 00:34:51,529
to say since enactment sin fuck you
access protocols

612
00:34:51,529 --> 00:34:54,869
socially do you have to go through and
and

613
00:34:54,869 --> 00:34:59,779
eraser let lol BC I'm it has been done
it was never party there

614
00:34:59,779 --> 00:35:03,190
and one in my previous talks I was
pursued even Chris sticky got sick

615
00:35:03,190 --> 00:35:08,819
and 2008 on but even points out as the
file PC security officer that nichols

616
00:35:08,819 --> 00:35:09,890
had a party has done

617
00:35:09,890 --> 00:35:13,210
well PC a number of times before he
didn't senegal

618
00:35:13,210 --> 00:35:16,690
he did it in a school in Boston other
jawn in school which you can see their

619
00:35:16,690 --> 00:35:19,710
web page is still under construction so
how the new technology

620
00:35:19,710 --> 00:35:23,270
he did something like in Cambodia
Cambodia the the road our results are

621
00:35:23,270 --> 00:35:25,339
still out on that and then there's RPC

622
00:35:25,339 --> 00:35:28,630
and you know and so ultimately the
question is ninety just does this happen

623
00:35:28,630 --> 00:35:30,940
and social good you know not up and
waiting

624
00:35:30,940 --> 00:35:34,210
on so I think there's some excess
options that we need to question I make

625
00:35:34,210 --> 00:35:36,710
a hill who still works on all PC and has
a big

626
00:35:36,710 --> 00:35:40,299
arm evangelist says you know we know
that laptop recipients will be able to

627
00:35:40,299 --> 00:35:41,650
benefit to be an

628
00:35:41,650 --> 00:35:44,470
from being able to fix improving
translate the software to which even

629
00:35:44,470 --> 00:35:45,210
replied

630
00:35:45,210 --> 00:35:49,460
no its not backlit by fact we do not
know that laptop recipients will benefit

631
00:35:49,460 --> 00:35:50,470
from texting software

632
00:35:50,470 --> 00:35:53,650
on so our there's

633
00:35:53,650 --> 00:35:56,740
we do we actually haven't figured that
out so I think um

634
00:35:56,740 --> 00:35:59,810
these that's the reason I brought
everybody hears assorted go there are

635
00:35:59,810 --> 00:36:00,779
things that we know

636
00:36:00,779 --> 00:36:04,619
about on how technology an axe social
change one thing so he knows it's not

637
00:36:04,619 --> 00:36:06,049
just the technology

638
00:36:06,049 --> 00:36:09,430
on I wonder for all you to a book that I
miss site heavily here

639
00:36:09,430 --> 00:36:12,368
I ever Rogers is diffusion of
innovations if you've read the tipping

640
00:36:12,369 --> 00:36:13,710
point by Malcolm Gladwell

641
00:36:13,710 --> 00:36:17,480
it's basically stolen will cost from
ever Rogers adhesion the nation's

642
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:21,099
which is just as readable book actually
is well worth going in and taking a look

643
00:36:21,099 --> 00:36:24,220
at it it's also are much more detailed
has wonderfully entertaining case

644
00:36:24,220 --> 00:36:25,109
studies

645
00:36:25,109 --> 00:36:29,029
I'm so I'm sorry my notes are kinda
giving me trouble here

646
00:36:29,029 --> 00:36:32,650
I'm trying to figure out how to undergo
on so Rogers's elements

647
00:36:32,650 --> 00:36:36,240
and rather things that ever Rogers puts
forward and fusion innovations

648
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:40,359
are a complex system I want a size that
you can understand the system

649
00:36:40,359 --> 00:36:43,680
and try to understand as a system don't
just say oh it's the social side of

650
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:44,080
things

651
00:36:44,080 --> 00:36:47,869
i'd lynn i think is as technologists on
a time we sort of girl

652
00:36:47,869 --> 00:36:51,369
on you know this technology in and
that's what we're gonna focus on

653
00:36:51,369 --> 00:36:55,470
on ever Rogers elements there's five of
them I think

654
00:36:55,470 --> 00:36:58,990
and the technology itself innovation is
only one of them

655
00:36:58,990 --> 00:37:03,250
on and but the thing he he says also is
that the technology is not just a

656
00:37:03,250 --> 00:37:04,470
technology

657
00:37:04,470 --> 00:37:08,430
technology may I be almost entirely
composed information

658
00:37:08,430 --> 00:37:11,520
so examples are political philosophy
such as Marxism

659
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:16,089
a religious ideas such as Christianity a
news event I'll write policies anybody's

660
00:37:16,089 --> 00:37:16,720
the sound like

661
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:20,210
another concept and it is really with
shouted out

662
00:37:20,210 --> 00:37:23,319
meems basically so every Rogers's idea I
love

663
00:37:23,319 --> 00:37:27,170
other technologies also I mean so
technologies me means technology

664
00:37:27,170 --> 00:37:30,520
on and and that sort of thing so when we
get into that territory no we're not

665
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:33,109
just talking about the things we can
actually hang on

666
00:37:33,109 --> 00:37:38,930
on so up a lot you have to communicate
is about how to use the technology

667
00:37:38,930 --> 00:37:42,390
answer the second element is tech nerd a
invasion is

668
00:37:42,390 --> 00:37:46,890
is communicated through channels and so
is the point at which minimises hackers

669
00:37:46,890 --> 00:37:50,540
got PR marketing screw those guys you
now sell

670
00:37:50,540 --> 00:37:53,650
but you know this means dealing with TV
it means being on point

671
00:37:53,650 --> 00:37:56,770
having talking points for Purdue working
in the press

672
00:37:56,770 --> 00:38:00,270
you know going to face buttons like as
well third element the system

673
00:38:00,270 --> 00:38:03,779
Rd the innovation diffuses overtime on

674
00:38:03,779 --> 00:38:07,480
and that's where else is having a
history beyond our control we don't

675
00:38:07,480 --> 00:38:10,210
really know we can do this we might get
slashed on it and then nobody pay

676
00:38:10,210 --> 00:38:11,839
attention to their again

677
00:38:11,839 --> 00:38:16,170
I and then and the fourth element is its
diffused among members of a social

678
00:38:16,170 --> 00:38:19,970
system and so our God suddenly it's a
social situation how did I get here I'm

679
00:38:19,970 --> 00:38:21,960
not good at the social dance

680
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:25,589
this is not my beautiful life this is
not a beautiful house I'm so this is

681
00:38:25,589 --> 00:38:26,240
where we

682
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:29,790
we hit maps wearable flow chart I'm
unfortunately this is something

683
00:38:29,790 --> 00:38:32,049
unfortunately this is this is the point
at which

684
00:38:32,049 --> 00:38:35,529
many on many so many innovations I just

685
00:38:35,529 --> 00:38:39,220
founder and fail and it behooves us to
understand

686
00:38:39,220 --> 00:38:42,799
I you know as matt said your allies are
on

687
00:38:42,799 --> 00:38:45,880
in and yeah so Anna

688
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:49,329
another thing to remember I'm if you've
read The Tipping Point is at

689
00:38:49,329 --> 00:38:53,270
and not every a doctor technology is the
same you have your early innovators you

690
00:38:53,270 --> 00:38:54,670
have your early adopters

691
00:38:54,670 --> 00:38:58,799
on-air the ones who end up spreading it
to the early majority

692
00:38:58,799 --> 00:39:01,710
blame jordy weights and watches to see
what other people are doing and you have

693
00:39:01,710 --> 00:39:02,660
your laggards

694
00:39:02,660 --> 00:39:05,799
and see you have to talk to people in
different ways you can't just go and

695
00:39:05,799 --> 00:39:07,230
talk to all from the same way so

696
00:39:07,230 --> 00:39:10,650
it also the duty to know who you're
talking to you at a given time

697
00:39:10,650 --> 00:39:14,859
on and no person I think about here's
Bunnell a tour

698
00:39:14,859 --> 00:39:18,000
on wanna christina was a lot of his work

699
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:21,310
pilot orders on us for sociology of
Technology

700
00:39:21,310 --> 00:39:24,640
and he says we have an actor network
system cell

701
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:28,368
add the technology is in amongst a whole
bunch of other technologies

702
00:39:28,369 --> 00:39:32,080
and technology said to be adopted in
clusters so you have to know about the

703
00:39:32,080 --> 00:39:33,779
other technologies they're out there

704
00:39:33,779 --> 00:39:37,380
on this course if remembers the history
the Betamax is one of the main reasons

705
00:39:37,380 --> 00:39:39,400
as I can you have to the tapes and

706
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:42,580
VCR and you know there'll be elements

707
00:39:42,580 --> 00:39:45,690
a the TV broadcast system as well

708
00:39:45,690 --> 00:39:48,739
Rd have to think about um another thing
to think about

709
00:39:48,739 --> 00:39:52,319
a the printing presses a great one we
often go back to that as scholars a

710
00:39:52,319 --> 00:39:57,299
a technology education on you can't
really say the printing press

711
00:39:57,299 --> 00:40:01,040
cause the spread of Protestantism they
were very much symbiotic so I

712
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:05,100
you know present church depended on the
printing press to get the word out there

713
00:40:05,100 --> 00:40:09,089
about Bible and you know the Bible
depended on

714
00:40:09,089 --> 00:40:12,319
you know that the printing press
depended on the passengers to help

715
00:40:12,319 --> 00:40:12,750
spread

716
00:40:12,750 --> 00:40:17,020
its use as well so basically take away
here is beware every search

717
00:40:17,020 --> 00:40:20,779
as well not just am I'm not just not as
research but also articles in the press

718
00:40:20,779 --> 00:40:22,450
the treat technology as the

719
00:40:22,450 --> 00:40:26,660
only agent a change in a situation
because there are many many agents at

720
00:40:26,660 --> 00:40:27,440
work

721
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:30,950
on and another thing to keep in mind is
that a lot innovation research has a pro

722
00:40:30,950 --> 00:40:32,140
diffusion bias

723
00:40:32,140 --> 00:40:35,180
so if you're reading something that says
he has to be defused really well

724
00:40:35,180 --> 00:40:37,609
remember they've probably gone looking
for the diffusion is a look at the

725
00:40:37,609 --> 00:40:39,290
methods that a particular study into
girl

726
00:40:39,290 --> 00:40:45,270
haven't I don't I'm Nano is Kenny
Williams and every I ask you human and

727
00:40:45,270 --> 00:40:46,859
animal had a little question answer
center

728
00:40:46,859 --> 00:40:50,900
a after its so I am smoke

729
00:40:50,900 --> 00:40:55,270
too much ethical I think Dylan a rodgers
also points out

730
00:40:55,270 --> 00:40:59,350
a that it's not just the technology but
it's perceived attributes that matter

731
00:40:59,350 --> 00:41:00,250
and these are

732
00:41:00,250 --> 00:41:04,670
these things to happen a screen here
relative adventurer technology think we

733
00:41:04,670 --> 00:41:06,049
understand pretty well

734
00:41:06,049 --> 00:41:09,819
but combat compatibility is a huge huge
issue is with

735
00:41:09,819 --> 00:41:13,200
on people's existing values as well as
well as the technology there is a very

736
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:14,279
very good study done

737
00:41:14,279 --> 00:41:18,589
about early diffusion I love I Apple
computers to classrooms Apple follow

738
00:41:18,589 --> 00:41:19,299
that closely

739
00:41:19,299 --> 00:41:24,210
and research did and there a couple
things that teachers didn't get

740
00:41:24,210 --> 00:41:27,770
and one of them was that you know kids
can teach themselves so

741
00:41:27,770 --> 00:41:32,310
even teachers I am the kids and teach
themselves as less of a sort of a siege

742
00:41:32,310 --> 00:41:35,450
on a stage model teaching it's a guide
on the side for this computer

743
00:41:35,450 --> 00:41:39,350
the teacher standing next year helping
you you work through our technology

744
00:41:39,350 --> 00:41:42,830
on even teachers who prefer the guide on
the side model now

745
00:41:42,830 --> 00:41:46,380
sometimes did not adopt that model the
technology in the classroom

746
00:41:46,380 --> 00:41:50,410
because they were so busy learning the
new technology that they simply didn't

747
00:41:50,410 --> 00:41:51,140
have time

748
00:41:51,140 --> 00:41:54,819
so the end up doing a lot of fun you
know the end up doing a lot of training

749
00:41:54,819 --> 00:41:56,440
for themselves

750
00:41:56,440 --> 00:42:00,369
on so that is that's another part
compatibility attorney about

751
00:42:00,369 --> 00:42:02,239
compatibility in the school

752
00:42:02,239 --> 00:42:06,880
I complexity I in schools especially
house in a book

753
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:10,779
the new meaning educational change by
Michael fallen and points out there

754
00:42:10,779 --> 00:42:14,609
a school suffer from Christmas tree
syndrome where

755
00:42:14,609 --> 00:42:18,650
everybody's trying to add more programs
onto the school awesome or program start

756
00:42:18,650 --> 00:42:22,190
less likely things I'd take because
teachers start burning out answer going

757
00:42:22,190 --> 00:42:24,170
why are you doing this I don't see the
point

758
00:42:24,170 --> 00:42:28,609
I'm trial abilities important %uh the
door Aki bored many view be

759
00:42:28,609 --> 00:42:30,880
may be familiar with that and say it's
the greatest thing since sliced bread

760
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:33,989
but the problem is it takes a week's
worth the train and get somebody

761
00:42:33,989 --> 00:42:37,069
a who has been trained on Corti up to
speed

762
00:42:37,069 --> 00:42:43,330
so trial ability is not really a good
with work for people who aren't needed

763
00:42:43,330 --> 00:42:46,190
you know not slow down their work
process any in order to adopt in

764
00:42:46,190 --> 00:42:49,810
observability also is really important
in classrooms and hard handling

765
00:42:49,810 --> 00:42:51,869
classrooms because teachers generally
can't

766
00:42:51,869 --> 00:42:55,060
observe each other and how they're using
technology in the classrooms because

767
00:42:55,060 --> 00:42:56,000
they just don't have time

768
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:59,020
it's not my schedule so all these things
will shape

769
00:42:59,020 --> 00:43:02,770
on how you end up how technology end up
getting

770
00:43:02,770 --> 00:43:07,470
top 10 couple takeaways were quickly and
technology has meaning

771
00:43:07,470 --> 00:43:10,770
beyond are meaning I love you know

772
00:43:10,770 --> 00:43:14,410
the Linux kernel as it kinda freedom you
know free software is free

773
00:43:14,410 --> 00:43:18,009
that's not the only kinda meaning I have
this particular side because Sam

774
00:43:18,009 --> 00:43:21,920
if you have a hole in the wall project
in India is had computers where kids can

775
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:24,080
interact with them with no guidance
whatsoever

776
00:43:24,080 --> 00:43:27,100
and the kids ended up calling the
hourglass

777
00:43:27,100 --> 00:43:30,270
a drama and the pointer in need of

778
00:43:30,270 --> 00:43:33,790
because that was what they would like to
them and their culture cell on

779
00:43:33,790 --> 00:43:36,460
you know they people will sign their
meanings to it and if you are not

780
00:43:36,460 --> 00:43:37,880
helping work with him

781
00:43:37,880 --> 00:43:40,980
on what the meaning of the technology is
the meaning you know

782
00:43:40,980 --> 00:43:43,970
you are going to be the guy on the side
and not the sage on the stage and that's

783
00:43:43,970 --> 00:43:46,710
what we want you to do with technology
lets you do that people are not

784
00:43:46,710 --> 00:43:49,509
necessary to pick that up from a
technology itself

785
00:43:49,509 --> 00:43:53,940
this is a non-trivial problem on but if
you know you know how to understand it

786
00:43:53,940 --> 00:43:54,739
you know there is

787
00:43:54,739 --> 00:43:58,270
room to work with is complex system but
this does take I am

788
00:43:58,270 --> 00:44:01,880
you know a understanding in reading of
social science work

789
00:44:01,880 --> 00:44:05,480
I know many who think that's very
squishy and very much down on the social

790
00:44:05,480 --> 00:44:06,279
ladder from

791
00:44:06,279 --> 00:44:09,859
you know physics and math but frankly
physics and math are not studies of

792
00:44:09,859 --> 00:44:12,710
human beings and unfortunately human
beings are complex you can apply to

793
00:44:12,710 --> 00:44:13,540
science there

794
00:44:13,540 --> 00:44:16,790
you have to look at social sciences and
there's a just anthropology and part is

795
00:44:16,790 --> 00:44:17,650
great

796
00:44:17,650 --> 00:44:21,369
I'm not too fond of social science or a
sociology paper your at Sydney

797
00:44:21,369 --> 00:44:25,770
I but sad yes 11 we've seen is in a
couple cases this idea that belief

798
00:44:25,770 --> 00:44:29,549
is an important with Christina's and you
know the

799
00:44:29,549 --> 00:44:32,790
group didn't have a template for
understanding community radio they just

800
00:44:32,790 --> 00:44:33,609
did not

801
00:44:33,609 --> 00:44:36,900
have a concept to see the concept has to
be taught along with

802
00:44:36,900 --> 00:44:39,839
the actual teaching technology itself
otherwise you end up with users doing

803
00:44:39,839 --> 00:44:40,609
things that you don't

804
00:44:40,609 --> 00:44:44,440
really what to expect like using the CD
trained as a couple dir

805
00:44:44,440 --> 00:44:48,529
our the CD itself as a near so on

806
00:44:48,529 --> 00:44:51,730
users have to agree with you on our
technology means what it meant to do

807
00:44:51,730 --> 00:44:54,830
if it's to make the intended change I am
has

808
00:44:54,830 --> 00:44:58,319
a Christian says when everything's
working order we don't see any social

809
00:44:58,319 --> 00:44:59,060
forces

810
00:44:59,060 --> 00:45:04,040
I am but we have to work on them if we
want anything to actually be adopted

811
00:45:04,040 --> 00:45:07,140
that I have said we can bring lights up
with him a little bit acumen acres in

812
00:45:07,140 --> 00:45:14,140
every likes tequila nannies

813
00:45:14,509 --> 00:45:17,660
and Metcash and we have police 10
tenants

814
00:45:17,660 --> 00:45:22,020
okay yes hi I'm really glad to have
someone identified that

815
00:45:22,020 --> 00:45:25,150
I not Gladwell ripped off ever Rogers
Welsh

816
00:45:25,150 --> 00:45:28,359
act without admitting it without
acknowledging my all that frustrating to

817
00:45:28,359 --> 00:45:29,509
me when I saw that and I

818
00:45:29,509 --> 00:45:33,880
I i have found this very useful on the
scientist at work for a federal agency

819
00:45:33,880 --> 00:45:37,390
call and and that I work in a big I work
in a big bureaucracy nathan Deal

820
00:45:37,390 --> 00:45:41,710
to live in a complicated system and so I
I am working I work

821
00:45:41,710 --> 00:45:45,470
I have with that kinda invisibly within
my agency using a

822
00:45:45,470 --> 00:45:49,109
an approach called the there's a theory
of living human systems developed by

823
00:45:49,109 --> 00:45:50,560
Yvonne a gazillion

824
00:45:50,560 --> 00:45:54,130
who is a add it started out it's a it's
a synthesiser

825
00:45:54,130 --> 00:45:58,089
individual dynamic group and psychology
and group dynamics

826
00:45:58,089 --> 00:46:01,279
but it's been it's been grabbed onto by
a lot of people who are interested in

827
00:46:01,279 --> 00:46:04,099
science because it offers some very
practical

828
00:46:04,099 --> 00:46:07,470
I operationally defined to find

829
00:46:07,470 --> 00:46:11,630
your theoretical ideas and practical
approaches and so for example one thing

830
00:46:11,630 --> 00:46:12,040
with

831
00:46:12,040 --> 00:46:15,230
the the idea that if you're is to look
at the hierarchy

832
00:46:15,230 --> 00:46:19,009
systems human systems that you're
operating in anti get your intervention

833
00:46:19,009 --> 00:46:20,790
to the middle system

834
00:46:20,790 --> 00:46:24,060
that that you're looking at so not the
not the managers and not there the

835
00:46:24,060 --> 00:46:27,410
people who are just gonna at importantly
don't have your say an honor to once

836
00:46:27,410 --> 00:46:28,170
more

837
00:46:28,170 --> 00:46:32,200
interacting you can get them to change
then they can influence both systems

838
00:46:32,200 --> 00:46:36,520
another idea is to in any kind of
discussion in a group to

839
00:46:36,520 --> 00:46:40,099
focus on decoding the yes butts that if
you can

840
00:46:40,099 --> 00:46:44,190
explore the yes and explore the butt
then you have an opportunity to

841
00:46:44,190 --> 00:46:47,839
identify and a great summer the
differences that are in that in that

842
00:46:47,839 --> 00:46:50,400
particular group so they're not every
practical tools

843
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:53,670
happen if you wanna learn a bit more
about it but there it's something that

844
00:46:53,670 --> 00:46:57,799
really growing and and Desert Ridge
traveling in a despues Inc out at the

845
00:46:57,799 --> 00:46:58,170
inn

846
00:46:58,170 --> 00:47:02,330
psychology I good dynamics
organizational development girl

847
00:47:02,330 --> 00:47:06,098
into some other worlds I wanna follow up
on that a little thats a really

848
00:47:06,099 --> 00:47:08,549
wonderful point i'm glad you brought up
that particular author I've never heard

849
00:47:08,549 --> 00:47:08,950
her

850
00:47:08,950 --> 00:47:12,020
on but an I have a

851
00:47:12,020 --> 00:47:15,369
Etienne acquaintance who went off to
african peace corps

852
00:47:15,369 --> 00:47:19,009
arm and ended up teaching technology in
school and a

853
00:47:19,009 --> 00:47:22,130
was frustrating kept saying I just want
these people to see logic and reason

854
00:47:22,130 --> 00:47:23,750
that's all I wanna do this and

855
00:47:23,750 --> 00:47:29,029
you know I like thanks Christopher
Columbus for being a colonialist but on

856
00:47:29,029 --> 00:47:32,619
so and and I kept saying to him you know
people have different

857
00:47:32,619 --> 00:47:35,869
takes on his things and I don't think
science was even I miss talking about

858
00:47:35,869 --> 00:47:37,599
the social construct nature science

859
00:47:37,599 --> 00:47:40,390
sciences socially constructed everybody
in here is gonna tell me it's an

860
00:47:40,390 --> 00:47:42,049
abstract truth but now

861
00:47:42,049 --> 00:47:45,250
on the thing to keep in mind is that
thank you

862
00:47:45,250 --> 00:47:49,020
art science as we understand it

863
00:47:49,020 --> 00:47:52,099
as people who have been through up
through

864
00:47:52,099 --> 00:47:56,509
undergraduate education or high school
is not the same

865
00:47:56,509 --> 00:47:59,980
as what somebody who writes NSF grants
constantly

866
00:47:59,980 --> 00:48:03,089
you the people who write in a separate
costly understand it is a very different

867
00:48:03,089 --> 00:48:05,779
process what we do in school is
memorized science was you had a really

868
00:48:05,779 --> 00:48:06,310
good

869
00:48:06,310 --> 00:48:10,170
curriculum on we are not actually
engaging in scientific inquiry we are

870
00:48:10,170 --> 00:48:11,089
not actually

871
00:48:11,089 --> 00:48:14,369
and you know and

872
00:48:14,369 --> 00:48:17,930
waiting the grants and and and
negotiating with the other scientists

873
00:48:17,930 --> 00:48:20,680
who are doing similar research in
positioning ourselves versus than

874
00:48:20,680 --> 00:48:24,989
so I we forget sometimes that there are
the social factors even in the things

875
00:48:24,989 --> 00:48:26,390
that we're memorizing as

876
00:48:26,390 --> 00:48:30,098
abstract truth on and it's worth started
working on our own beliefs

877
00:48:30,099 --> 00:48:33,549
about what is true that way and I'm I've
was going to emphasize that another talk

878
00:48:33,549 --> 00:48:35,250
but I'll shut up about it now

879
00:48:35,250 --> 00:48:38,759
presented my animator some the other
micro

880
00:48:38,759 --> 00:48:44,529
me there a.m.

881
00:48:44,529 --> 00:48:48,369
now I totally agree that people working
in technology should read some social

882
00:48:48,369 --> 00:48:49,040
science

883
00:48:49,040 --> 00:48:53,250
on as winning I mean

884
00:48:53,250 --> 00:48:57,599
it is to question but very overwhelming
ike if you can make recommendations were

885
00:48:57,599 --> 00:48:59,279
even better though if they're

886
00:48:59,279 --> 00:49:03,130
RSS recommendations that you know for
people working technology

887
00:49:03,130 --> 00:49:07,310
to get their feet wet & Sons call that's
a great question

888
00:49:07,310 --> 00:49:10,489
I'm so that was Yvonne magazine ran was
the name but

889
00:49:10,489 --> 00:49:15,690
agassi re and even a gazillion social
organizational psych

890
00:49:15,690 --> 00:49:20,069
I after posting on my course syllabi and
get help

891
00:49:20,069 --> 00:49:23,900
and even for King courses it so that we
can collaborate on them

892
00:49:23,900 --> 00:49:28,869
and some I would recommend the real I
said God of us who've technology courses

893
00:49:28,869 --> 00:49:29,210
and

894
00:49:29,210 --> 00:49:32,660
course in digital literacies they're
probably have

895
00:49:32,660 --> 00:49:36,920
some good thing some think details are
all kinda but we're in

896
00:49:36,920 --> 00:49:41,599
yeah I'm running a drill it or he's also
a fun read sir

897
00:49:41,599 --> 00:49:46,660
person hungry oksana rougher sledding
others via

898
00:49:46,660 --> 00:49:51,140
arm I would recommend a pretty classic
essay by langdon winner

899
00:49:51,140 --> 00:49:54,980
called do artifacts have politics is a
philosopher

900
00:49:54,980 --> 00:49:58,580
it is a very clear read arm

901
00:49:58,580 --> 00:50:04,239
that would be one there's also a classic
essay column

902
00:50:04,239 --> 00:50:07,250
letters all construction and technology
I think on

903
00:50:07,250 --> 00:50:11,750
by Trevor pants kak arm that is

904
00:50:11,750 --> 00:50:15,119
yeah it's 8 its I'm about to get on a
bicycle

905
00:50:15,119 --> 00:50:20,569
and the 19th century but it lays out a
framework for understanding

906
00:50:20,569 --> 00:50:25,380
I how certain artifacts Alliance s all
processors to send affect each other

907
00:50:25,380 --> 00:50:29,259
anybody wants is you can see me after as
I write them down

908
00:50:29,259 --> 00:50:32,750
I'm gonna him I'm gonna embarrass
Christina by also saying that if you

909
00:50:32,750 --> 00:50:33,910
google her name

910
00:50:33,910 --> 00:50:38,029
amana manic technology she's got a great
blog post from a couple years ago which

911
00:50:38,029 --> 00:50:40,319
was started a blog the fight version

912
00:50:40,319 --> 00:50:45,410
other I'm a class act as insiders I'm so
that's a great meeting less than a dozen

913
00:50:45,410 --> 00:50:47,779
more than its worth a narrative eyes
being less

914
00:50:47,779 --> 00:50:52,299
I'm so and Henrik receptor actually
chris is last talked to get help as well

915
00:50:52,299 --> 00:50:54,670
as for the new picture our farm

916
00:50:54,670 --> 00:51:00,480
specifically a content farms and thin
brought my friend is different in your

917
00:51:00,480 --> 00:51:04,650
as I hear yah under israeli like I've
been fins working on a fabulous book

918
00:51:04,650 --> 00:51:06,569
about spam I read it drafts on

919
00:51:06,569 --> 00:51:10,619
it is a really beautiful picture I love
the arms race between

920
00:51:10,619 --> 00:51:14,359
and technology and has a wonderful
metaphor about web sites that are

921
00:51:14,359 --> 00:51:17,369
readable by human eyes and web site web
sites that are readable by robot eyes

922
00:51:17,369 --> 00:51:17,690
but

923
00:51:17,690 --> 00:51:21,489
theory was like I said I'm be ever
Rogers

924
00:51:21,489 --> 00:51:25,420
and if you really have to you can read
even remember Manuel

925
00:51:25,420 --> 00:51:29,770
I am but sad yeah and even critics
article on

926
00:51:29,770 --> 00:51:33,489
am OLPC his post mortem I'll PC was
really really good and the other person

927
00:51:33,489 --> 00:51:35,040
he's working with

928
00:51:35,040 --> 00:51:37,670
I forget the name of the guy he's
working with that he there's not a guy

929
00:51:37,670 --> 00:51:39,480
at all PC who he likes to use

930
00:51:39,480 --> 00:51:42,719
doing and a continued you lot of good
work will be /c on the social side of

931
00:51:42,719 --> 00:51:43,480
things

932
00:51:43,480 --> 00:51:47,589
on we were on questions yes

933
00:51:47,589 --> 00:51:51,599
yes I a 7-1/2 Co yards in what way do
you think the

934
00:51:51,599 --> 00:51:54,750
twitter is sort of a failure because it

935
00:51:54,750 --> 00:51:57,940
because it to plus it's a costs and

936
00:51:57,940 --> 00:52:01,660
why do what I don't think Twitter is a
failure know ed

937
00:52:01,660 --> 00:52:04,690
in the sense of the more more from next
month

938
00:52:04,690 --> 00:52:08,849
writer I don't winners actually been a
remarkably successful hack

939
00:52:08,849 --> 00:52:11,989
I love up text mom but I don't think it
comes

940
00:52:11,989 --> 00:52:15,580
in bed it just because it's the same
technology doesn't mean that it comes

941
00:52:15,580 --> 00:52:20,020
embedded with the same social believes
that the technology was meant to foster

942
00:52:20,020 --> 00:52:23,830
where was text but the social believe so
are steel

943
00:52:23,830 --> 00:52:26,920
late you good you can embed them into
the platform

944
00:52:26,920 --> 00:52:30,849
that the thing is that I i believe that
just because you can like said in a

945
00:52:30,849 --> 00:52:32,739
Twitter account to follow can US

946
00:52:32,739 --> 00:52:36,430
and then you can make bump into things
that you would have never bumped into

947
00:52:36,430 --> 00:52:40,080
your name and yeah an epic actually

948
00:52:40,080 --> 00:52:43,330
the thing I'm sorry time other things
that I keep thinking about is actually

949
00:52:43,330 --> 00:52:45,410
I'd like Twitter's doing remarkably
better than Facebook

950
00:52:45,410 --> 00:52:48,430
an ans does continue to have that in
that the

951
00:52:48,430 --> 00:52:51,219
the company continues to make good
decisions better decisions about privacy

952
00:52:51,219 --> 00:52:51,849
movies but

953
00:52:51,849 --> 00:52:55,660
not that was once but better for the
most part live gone to bat for privacy

954
00:52:55,660 --> 00:52:56,319
every once in a while

955
00:52:56,319 --> 00:53:00,160
here's what I would say quickly I think
that the there's a the question is is

956
00:53:00,160 --> 00:53:01,930
Twitter good at serving certain

957
00:53:01,930 --> 00:53:05,270
activist causes because it has this sort
of

958
00:53:05,270 --> 00:53:08,799
text ma BD n/a built into it right is
there something about

959
00:53:08,799 --> 00:53:14,489
the the affords the platform that allow
it to do certain things really well

960
00:53:14,489 --> 00:53:19,710
um for Sega time I'll simply say the
answer is yes but

961
00:53:19,710 --> 00:53:23,119
on and I don't entirely disagree with
you actually I'll

962
00:53:23,119 --> 00:53:27,279
but I do think for the purposes of this
talk it's important to keep in mind that

963
00:53:27,279 --> 00:53:30,509
the two things are not automatic

964
00:53:30,509 --> 00:53:33,569
I don't think I think even in bed
affordances

965
00:53:33,569 --> 00:53:37,950
don't make certain social behaviors and
don't make certain social beliefs

966
00:53:37,950 --> 00:53:42,369
automatic but at in primarily I just
think that

967
00:53:42,369 --> 00:53:45,960
the relationship between textiles winter
is a great way to house

968
00:53:45,960 --> 00:53:49,839
and a conversation about this right it's
a great way to have an argument about

969
00:53:49,839 --> 00:53:54,330
you know to what degree are social
technological affordances embedded

970
00:53:54,330 --> 00:53:57,730
within technology because you can see
the relationship the relationship is not

971
00:53:57,730 --> 00:54:00,759
hidden there's an actual genealogical
relationship

972
00:54:00,759 --> 00:54:03,680
between these technologies and I think
another thing to remember is that human

973
00:54:03,680 --> 00:54:05,009
beings have free will

974
00:54:05,009 --> 00:54:08,150
don't forget that they will do things
like help let up in

975
00:54:08,150 --> 00:54:11,719
in in the CD Drive I mean it's just we
come up with inventive ways to do things

976
00:54:11,719 --> 00:54:13,440
and to believe that things are

977
00:54:13,440 --> 00:54:17,509
in a lot too bleak coded into the
technology

978
00:54:17,509 --> 00:54:20,509
is to deny free well I think we need to
keep just

979
00:54:20,509 --> 00:54:23,770
continue to engage with that as we're
thinking about this last week

980
00:54:23,770 --> 00:54:27,290
believe that no longer exists some much

981
00:54:27,290 --> 00:54:30,810
one more start we have stopped thanks on
our side thank you so much

982
00:54:30,810 --> 00:54:36,980
amazing crowd for 11 on hey on this year
