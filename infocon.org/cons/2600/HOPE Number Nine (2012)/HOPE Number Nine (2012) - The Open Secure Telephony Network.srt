1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:04,390
then a without further ado I would like
to present the open source telephony

2
00:00:04,390 --> 00:00:05,290
network

3
00:00:05,290 --> 00:00:08,460
leaving dominantly other lol and mark
Polansky their

4
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:15,460
has everything today

5
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:20,770
great we are actually the open

6
00:00:20,770 --> 00:00:24,140
secure telephone network but open source
toughening network

7
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:27,410
also works because we are in fact an
open source project

8
00:00:27,410 --> 00:00:31,460
yet us open source answer arm so it's
really fun to be here today

9
00:00:31,460 --> 00:00:35,040
arm we and I both work for the the
Guardian project

10
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:38,839
arm myself I my name's mark Polansky

11
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:42,379
and I'm creative technologist at
Guardian project I'm

12
00:00:42,379 --> 00:00:46,489
my background is a family that came as
refugees to this country

13
00:00:46,489 --> 00:00:50,899
and so on my interest is really in how
of freedom is expressed under closed

14
00:00:50,899 --> 00:00:52,460
societies and how we can build

15
00:00:52,460 --> 00:00:56,070
the technologies to to support people

16
00:00:56,070 --> 00:00:59,120
and their human rights abroad and I'm

17
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:02,320
and maintains the Israel

18
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:05,920
I A also work with going project I

19
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:10,150
this is my way think seventh hope
conference and to

20
00:01:10,150 --> 00:01:13,590
and I I owe a lot to hope and not to get
too

21
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:17,369
a nostalgic but you know i i definitely
the hacker community here has

22
00:01:17,369 --> 00:01:20,820
influence me a lot and the work I'm
doing and with Guardian project

23
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:23,909
on on secure Voice over IP

24
00:01:23,909 --> 00:01:27,180
and a his and

25
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:30,340
definitely came out of this sir this
kinda culture

26
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:33,439
and makes me feel good that it's serve
arrived and we have her

27
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:36,740
an yet so I built the infrastructure
needed all engineering

28
00:01:36,740 --> 00:01:39,890
and assistance an for a stud

29
00:01:39,890 --> 00:01:43,840
Austin for us to so this is going to be
a highly technical talk

30
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:47,490
and there's going to be a lot of a
international context has set up

31
00:01:47,490 --> 00:01:51,649
why it is that we're doing this I so to
get looked a little background about

32
00:01:51,649 --> 00:01:53,310
what the Guardian project is

33
00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:57,030
up Guardian project is a research and
development up

34
00:01:57,030 --> 00:02:00,329
company that's really trying to push the
limits of white

35
00:02:00,329 --> 00:02:03,520
secure or anonymous communication

36
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:07,899
can be on mobile phone how can we
establish standards and really

37
00:02:07,899 --> 00:02:12,010
raised level for ARM all players not
just ourselves to really

38
00:02:12,010 --> 00:02:15,010
build better tools arm where

39
00:02:15,010 --> 00:02:18,750
open source by default and trying to
establish security by Paul

40
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:22,349
as well mom and a the reasoning being
that

41
00:02:22,349 --> 00:02:26,420
together we have more collective
computing power in our pockets

42
00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:30,540
by having on these phones actually
sitting in there

43
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:34,010
arm so we have more power as little
brother then

44
00:02:34,010 --> 00:02:37,530
Big Brother potentially has if we use
them effectively

45
00:02:37,530 --> 00:02:40,840
in these are basically Munich stations
to happen we I

46
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:45,510
leverage them so

47
00:02:45,510 --> 00:02:48,700
our goal is really for people around the
world on

48
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:52,480
to have their devices help them to
attain human rights

49
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:56,768
arm to make sure that Internet
communication is

50
00:02:56,769 --> 00:03:01,120
open that people can experience freedom
they can embrace it and

51
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:04,430
the reasoning being that mobile is
really becoming be

52
00:03:04,430 --> 00:03:07,819
pervasive technology that out there
people

53
00:03:07,819 --> 00:03:11,370
even the poorest parts up the world have
mobile phones

54
00:03:11,370 --> 00:03:15,950
in their pockets I increasingly they
have feature phones

55
00:03:15,950 --> 00:03:19,510
and as the price point is lowering
dramatically

56
00:03:19,510 --> 00:03:23,790
we're seeing this proliferation
smartphones and especially on the

57
00:03:23,790 --> 00:03:24,690
Android platform

58
00:03:24,690 --> 00:03:28,079
becoming the default I globally maybe
can describe

59
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:32,090
what a feature phone is in case that
people don't know sure so a feature

60
00:03:32,090 --> 00:03:33,900
phone being a phone that still has

61
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:38,450
access to Internet arm and some basic
functionality generally their Java based

62
00:03:38,450 --> 00:03:39,209
phones

63
00:03:39,209 --> 00:03:42,360
on but not quite up to the before I'm

64
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:46,220
you ap interface that were used to it
and parade i OS

65
00:03:46,220 --> 00:03:49,400
I'm simeon to a certain extent the their

66
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:52,939
did and they're they're generally much
lower cost than

67
00:03:52,939 --> 00:03:56,299
and something like annexes wonder Galaxy

68
00:03:56,299 --> 00:03:59,939
some like that arm

69
00:03:59,939 --> 00:04:03,269
and a lot of why we're in here

70
00:04:03,269 --> 00:04:08,080
today is because a from freaking and yet
we're seeing that man lines are starting

71
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:08,580
to

72
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:12,220
get lower and lower and lower so how can
we take the lessons from

73
00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:16,930
I triggers a bold and supplying them in
that the 21st century when

74
00:04:16,930 --> 00:04:20,478
this is been shifting to you know where
we have

75
00:04:20,478 --> 00:04:24,280
pots now I'm changing into PSTN

76
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:27,720
al yeah I and II mean this murder

77
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:31,400
like the the history you know nada I'd
decides

78
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:34,639
probably more familiar than most but the
history of telephony

79
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:38,850
and and and you know like I IP telephony

80
00:04:38,850 --> 00:04:43,810
and Hazare has been around a lot and
Berdych know I'd the PSTN a lot of link

81
00:04:43,810 --> 00:04:44,259
you know

82
00:04:44,259 --> 00:04:49,000
trunk lines man I P fracture for for
much longer than before we had them like

83
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:49,870
in our hands

84
00:04:49,870 --> 00:04:53,169
but you know now pretty much IP
telephony is is on

85
00:04:53,169 --> 00:04:56,210
is to the level where this disses

86
00:04:56,210 --> 00:04:59,948
just as good as anything else and and a

87
00:04:59,949 --> 00:05:02,789
yeah it's kinda changing up the
landscape in a changing at the Carrier

88
00:05:02,789 --> 00:05:03,580
landscape

89
00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:06,849
an and and the way that the carriers
work with

90
00:05:06,850 --> 00:05:10,479
her you know have these certain
arbitrary distinctions

91
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:13,560
a.m. but the carriers to find the space

92
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:17,340
and need to find in very different way
than any the technologies that we define

93
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:20,810
in the Internet age right I'm it more
than walled garden

94
00:05:20,810 --> 00:05:24,919
its literally sydell so you have these
monoliths

95
00:05:24,919 --> 00:05:28,960
I the a rise in building the AT&T
building is this huge

96
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:33,138
systems where they archer in this %ah
consciousness that

97
00:05:33,139 --> 00:05:36,210
you pay for data you pay for forts arm

98
00:05:36,210 --> 00:05:39,599
and there's no real relation to the
Internet age where

99
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:42,840
you can really conceptualize paying for
chat

100
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:46,310
I for instant message a picture SMS I

101
00:05:46,310 --> 00:05:50,030
right when it's the the carriers want to
charge us per every IRC message

102
00:05:50,030 --> 00:05:53,320
that we start communicating right that
seems like an anathema but that's

103
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:54,139
something that

104
00:05:54,139 --> 00:05:57,810
is taken for granted in the telephone
systems so outward

105
00:05:57,810 --> 00:06:01,169
redesigning or trying to reinterpret

106
00:06:01,169 --> 00:06:04,960
what tech secure telephone telephoning
be

107
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:08,109
the zircon some of the issues that we're
I thinking about

108
00:06:08,110 --> 00:06:11,500
yeah and and you know so so did to
distill all that

109
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:15,199
and am since we now like most most
people many people

110
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:18,910
and have the capabilities of both doing
IP telephony

111
00:06:18,910 --> 00:06:22,560
on their handsets and the carrier only
sees data

112
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:25,590
and how they see that data is a

113
00:06:25,590 --> 00:06:30,080
really what we're concerned with with a
open secure telephony network

114
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:33,818
as a standard best practices and to a
certain extent

115
00:06:33,819 --> 00:06:37,620
the hardware hacking community is is
iterating faster than the software

116
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:38,850
hacking community in this

117
00:06:38,850 --> 00:06:42,289
arena where if you look at place like
India

118
00:06:42,289 --> 00:06:45,880
the different carriers don't necessarily
inter operate across

119
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:49,350
I internal borders so say there's an
AT&T

120
00:06:49,350 --> 00:06:54,300
in New Jersey and arising in New York to
call one another would be like placing

121
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:55,620
international call

122
00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:58,710
right which is absurd that's way too
expensive in which a complicating the

123
00:06:58,710 --> 00:06:59,169
phones

124
00:06:59,169 --> 00:07:02,460
cost probably going to drop anyway and
so you see this growing

125
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:07,479
up quad the same hardware where you can
literally put four SIM card into one

126
00:07:07,479 --> 00:07:08,180
phone

127
00:07:08,180 --> 00:07:11,349
so that you could just place a call to
your grandma gives you know just over

128
00:07:11,349 --> 00:07:11,969
the water

129
00:07:11,970 --> 00:07:14,960
they're super cool I don't know how many
people actually seen them but it's like

130
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:17,300
the most ridiculous looking thing you
basically like

131
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:20,740
open this thing up and there's four sim
slots

132
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:23,830
and his staff to resign which would
which phone service would you like to

133
00:07:23,830 --> 00:07:25,560
use

134
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:29,139
right but written about building a
better system so that you don't actually

135
00:07:29,139 --> 00:07:32,210
great yeah it's a hack arm

136
00:07:32,210 --> 00:07:36,229
so while got a lot of accordion does is
open source by default

137
00:07:36,229 --> 00:07:39,690
are we still try to be as interoperable
as possible so that we can bring the

138
00:07:39,690 --> 00:07:40,560
standards

139
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:45,099
I to you all a group of course for
security we are open source or the

140
00:07:45,099 --> 00:07:49,319
code itself can be verified arm but
we're trying to port to the different

141
00:07:49,319 --> 00:07:50,580
systems so that we can

142
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:54,020
om give people access whether they're on
I O S whether they're on

143
00:07:54,020 --> 00:07:58,948
I'm blackberry or otherwise I'm polite
look too little survey

144
00:07:58,949 --> 00:08:02,060
you never talk about secure mobile to
get a sense of what we have here in the

145
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:02,789
audience

146
00:08:02,789 --> 00:08:08,190
so if you raise your hand over your
phone if you have an Android phone

147
00:08:08,190 --> 00:08:13,979
alright no it's not surprising alright
iPhone

148
00:08:13,979 --> 00:08:18,060
the I'll blackberry

149
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:23,729
I now we know who works for the
government

150
00:08:23,729 --> 00:08:27,340
and to translate were talking about bbm
from voice

151
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:31,780
right um Nokia

152
00:08:31,780 --> 00:08:36,930
I whom those are Nokia N 900

153
00:08:36,930 --> 00:08:41,399
Reebok other

154
00:08:41,399 --> 00:08:45,899
wet weather what the Windows Phone

155
00:08:45,899 --> 00:08:50,430
there's like than 900 a sank Belgacom

156
00:08:50,430 --> 00:08:53,560
so 2600 I made the groundwork

157
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:56,779
of why we're talking about I'm what

158
00:08:56,779 --> 00:08:59,779
and the need to have secure
communication

159
00:08:59,779 --> 00:09:04,180
right this is their sketch love I bobbin
hours trying to have a phone call

160
00:09:04,180 --> 00:09:08,100
in the United States I N this
infrastructure

161
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:12,320
a is replicated around the world where
there are various names for barriers

162
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:15,060
interceptors legally or extra legally

163
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:18,570
trying to get between I you and your
friend Alice

164
00:09:18,570 --> 00:09:21,680
as you try to actually place a call

165
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:25,089
arm at the same time it's a little bit
more than that

166
00:09:25,089 --> 00:09:28,390
with mobile phones there's also the
extension up

167
00:09:28,390 --> 00:09:31,510
the phone itself as well as the aP's
that

168
00:09:31,510 --> 00:09:35,200
way within it

169
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:38,850
and that's a that's an important
distinction a.m. used to talk about

170
00:09:38,850 --> 00:09:39,519
baseband

171
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:43,660
now yeah so a.m. the

172
00:09:43,660 --> 00:09:46,980
and the mobile phones a the carriers

173
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:50,890
have a baseband what's called a baseband
n and

174
00:09:50,890 --> 00:09:55,720
essentially it's eighty nother it's
another telephone inside if your mobile

175
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:58,269
phone that you can't control the
carriers can control it

176
00:09:58,269 --> 00:10:01,990
and there there have been unprovable
such the cases where

177
00:10:01,990 --> 00:10:05,829
and observers engineering where it was
discovered that there's a secondary

178
00:10:05,829 --> 00:10:07,380
microphone in the basement

179
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:11,310
and that you have no software
application access to it

180
00:10:11,310 --> 00:10:15,329
and so it's essentially its own computer
and there is one phone and forget

181
00:10:15,329 --> 00:10:18,570
with that name but the model is where
and

182
00:10:18,570 --> 00:10:22,910
I does i think is open loco and their
solutions the baseband is to treat it as

183
00:10:22,910 --> 00:10:23,990
a modem and send

184
00:10:23,990 --> 00:10:27,690
AT commands to it just figure out what
the hell it does and then

185
00:10:27,690 --> 00:10:32,120
program plate program that into the core
and but it really is a black box

186
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:37,510
and and only the carriers no how it
works

187
00:10:37,510 --> 00:10:41,600
on well will wait for questions until
later but yeah

188
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:45,329
why a separate microphone that's a very
good question and

189
00:10:45,329 --> 00:10:48,899
and yes so you know that's what a.m.

190
00:10:48,899 --> 00:10:53,140
a though a lot of the lawful intercept
and you know in the states

191
00:10:53,140 --> 00:10:56,480
kaliya is is that was up in a previous
life and and

192
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:59,800
you know as part of a hole intercepts
and in

193
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:02,820
in a federal United States federal law

194
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:09,190
and so the away it is literally a back
door

195
00:11:09,190 --> 00:11:12,589
so the question is you know how do you
how an actual private

196
00:11:12,589 --> 00:11:15,500
conversations that most people
conceptualized they're having private

197
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:17,670
conversations but they're not
necessarily

198
00:11:17,670 --> 00:11:20,949
able to do that which is extremely
problematic this is

199
00:11:20,950 --> 00:11:24,589
the conversation we're having the
nineties where encryption was

200
00:11:24,589 --> 00:11:28,500
I a dangerous weapon and then suddenly
has opened up in now we have internet

201
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:29,850
banking and all these

202
00:11:29,850 --> 00:11:33,820
I'm innovations increasingly businesses
aren't even having congress the

203
00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:37,220
phone calls when they're operating
internationally so people will send

204
00:11:37,220 --> 00:11:41,250
their people into the field in russia
and

205
00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:44,329
their phones are off yellow the the
official

206
00:11:44,329 --> 00:11:48,700
a a a and unnamed corporation had an
official draw love

207
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:52,279
no cell phone conversations outside of
the United States

208
00:11:52,279 --> 00:11:55,339
that was their solution to a secure
voice

209
00:11:55,339 --> 00:11:59,220
to the opportunity here for us also is
that the cost to businesses is rising

210
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:02,500
I was on in iraq working with

211
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:06,230
the mobile telcos their as we're
drafting the first

212
00:12:06,230 --> 00:12:09,910
bylaws that I we're going to come into
affect in the country

213
00:12:09,910 --> 00:12:13,850
and it was really a terrifying moment as
I was talking about the

214
00:12:13,850 --> 00:12:17,070
the privacy and security standards that
they need to have in those bylaws

215
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:21,089
as the telcos arm because

216
00:12:21,089 --> 00:12:24,380
that is just necessary for and
fundamental for human rights

217
00:12:24,380 --> 00:12:28,990
and the counter argument with the TV
show 24

218
00:12:28,990 --> 00:12:32,339
and this is in iraqi who's lived in Iraq
their whole life and

219
00:12:32,339 --> 00:12:36,160
is the vice president's company using 24
as an argument

220
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:40,639
and what I had come back with the saying
know if you have to transcribe

221
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:44,529
all love your cell phone records all the
conversations this could be a corruption

222
00:12:44,529 --> 00:12:47,149
tool to put yourself out business

223
00:12:47,149 --> 00:12:49,670
and that's something that they heard
really about clear and they were much

224
00:12:49,670 --> 00:12:53,260
more interested in having those privacy
and security standard suddenly put in

225
00:12:53,260 --> 00:12:56,620
so they wouldn't be burdened by
government bureaucracy arm

226
00:12:56,620 --> 00:13:00,040
I think its way to have a I legal a

227
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:04,810
business and a technical way really
encouraging the proliferation up these

228
00:13:04,810 --> 00:13:08,170
security standards in whatever way we
can and

229
00:13:08,170 --> 00:13:11,250
I'm sure there's a lot of people in the
audience myself included who do

230
00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:14,889
like 20 for a lot but on you know keep
in mind that

231
00:13:14,889 --> 00:13:17,899
24 has defined hacking the

232
00:13:17,899 --> 00:13:21,920
the network as purchasing I can defy and
connecting to that

233
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:25,029
and break in the fire law so

234
00:13:25,029 --> 00:13:28,660
from and increasingly we're seeing
countries around the world actually just

235
00:13:28,660 --> 00:13:30,180
blocking blackberry

236
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:33,639
are you gotta go into a context on where
they've done this arm

237
00:13:33,639 --> 00:13:36,810
and they're effectively cutting
themselves off from international

238
00:13:36,810 --> 00:13:37,589
business

239
00:13:37,589 --> 00:13:41,070
on as much as businesses are are
continuing to actually

240
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:44,510
use blackberry or will continue to use
them in the future right

241
00:13:44,510 --> 00:13:47,540
and so can we draw distinction to say
you either you know

242
00:13:47,540 --> 00:13:50,699
way in a secure or encrypt id

243
00:13:50,699 --> 00:13:54,250
manner I so that everybody's protected
or you just don't

244
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:58,220
enter into international business
dealings with XYZ company that you

245
00:13:58,220 --> 00:14:01,110
would otherwise be dealing with because
you have to send email you have to be on

246
00:14:01,110 --> 00:14:02,490
the messenger you have to you

247
00:14:02,490 --> 00:14:05,529
just communicate arm in

248
00:14:05,529 --> 00:14:08,880
China we saw Tom sky which is a

249
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:11,910
Chinese version up Skype thats actually

250
00:14:11,910 --> 00:14:15,510
with this guy company that has a very
explicit backdoor

251
00:14:15,510 --> 00:14:18,709
for I am all communications to go to the
chinese

252
00:14:18,709 --> 00:14:23,019
boards om so even the technology
standards that we could hurt me

253
00:14:23,019 --> 00:14:24,649
understand as cannabis

254
00:14:24,649 --> 00:14:28,820
hot secure best practices in the 21st
century with

255
00:14:28,820 --> 00:14:31,829
Voice over IP arm still Hans its

256
00:14:31,829 --> 00:14:34,880
security flaws in question is how much
does that exist

257
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:38,100
in the other versions have Skype on and
currently

258
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:42,070
Dave Microsoft after buying Skype is
issued a statement saying that they're

259
00:14:42,070 --> 00:14:42,820
moving

260
00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:46,440
are from super notes to their own
servers whether they're making their own

261
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:47,209
super notes

262
00:14:47,209 --> 00:14:50,649
so they haven't Devon they've got ready
supra notes but they just made better

263
00:14:50,649 --> 00:14:51,310
ones then

264
00:14:51,310 --> 00:14:54,680
your your local internet connection
could ever provide yeah they're making

265
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:58,560
the biggest one so you're communications
probably going to go through their super

266
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:00,480
notes not through the peer to peer

267
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:03,899
I met up method they used to in the past
and it's as an official statement

268
00:15:03,899 --> 00:15:07,120
Microsoft kinda trying to dance around
in this said like we haven't changed the

269
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:07,610
core

270
00:15:07,610 --> 00:15:10,810
peer to peer functionality of Skype
we've improved the

271
00:15:10,810 --> 00:15:15,600
service by adding more more of our own
high-quality infrastructure Obama

272
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:20,860
life and when I was in Bangladeshi was
amazing as my cell phone reception was

273
00:15:20,860 --> 00:15:22,630
much better than in the US

274
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:26,110
especially New York arm but I had to
give a thumbprint actually get a SIM

275
00:15:26,110 --> 00:15:26,959
card

276
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:30,430
army India now you have to give us our
security number for their equipment

277
00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:33,820
social security number to actually get a
SIM card arm

278
00:15:33,820 --> 00:15:38,209
and these this is becoming PC terrifying
because

279
00:15:38,209 --> 00:15:41,380
the phone represents the ultimate
intimacy in people have this

280
00:15:41,380 --> 00:15:44,730
on them all the time crew here does not
have a phone

281
00:15:44,730 --> 00:15:49,699
next to them for more than our day

282
00:15:49,699 --> 00:15:52,910
I mean it's about ten hands by the way
yeah

283
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:57,540
arm I hands on me at all times and I
think people expect that its on you at

284
00:15:57,540 --> 00:15:59,420
all times and there's a certain level up

285
00:15:59,420 --> 00:16:02,810
privacy protection when something so
intimate with you I'm

286
00:16:02,810 --> 00:16:06,680
and yet nothing much

287
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:09,810
I and again to go back to the

288
00:16:09,810 --> 00:16:13,990
be between six hundred octopus its I
beyond just

289
00:16:13,990 --> 00:16:18,459
the expected methods an interception
it's also what's actually in your pocket

290
00:16:18,459 --> 00:16:22,430
are so again late in the day so I really
like a shock and stock

291
00:16:22,430 --> 00:16:26,040
who plays Angry Birds is I know I'd

292
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:30,410
mom but on I A West they have accessed
your entire contact list

293
00:16:30,410 --> 00:16:34,769
right and if and average of five phones
have access to your

294
00:16:34,769 --> 00:16:38,660
SMS and MMS messages back at to be
really interesting

295
00:16:38,660 --> 00:16:41,920
I'm in an arab Anthony Weiner to give it
a little

296
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:45,029
New York shop

297
00:16:45,029 --> 00:16:48,329
which is often good to laugh bad until
you actually look at the statistics on

298
00:16:48,329 --> 00:16:49,139
how many

299
00:16:49,139 --> 00:16:52,740
I'm I mean anthony Weiner's are out
there

300
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:56,920
arm stooges

301
00:16:56,920 --> 00:17:00,029
that bad pun was not intended I follow

302
00:17:00,029 --> 00:17:03,360
own it own it our bed totally intended
arm

303
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:08,860
so in the UK a-arm a service for comm
group found that 47 percent of adults

304
00:17:08,860 --> 00:17:12,549
England send I sexy tax to their
significant others

305
00:17:12,549 --> 00:17:16,109
that's about and about 10 percent of
those

306
00:17:16,110 --> 00:17:20,870
have actually sent it to the wrong
person

307
00:17:20,870 --> 00:17:24,319
so it that's funny because that's user
error by

308
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:27,649
for everybody else 5 their app scan

309
00:17:27,650 --> 00:17:31,980
access all there and the masses and
we're not thinking about secure a mass

310
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:37,169
secure SMS this is on the farm and now
we can remove the install apk with

311
00:17:37,169 --> 00:17:39,380
Google Play which is hugely convenient

312
00:17:39,380 --> 00:17:43,440
but that just means install ap that
could potentially read all the

313
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:47,630
sex attacks the terrible are sitting on
whoever's mobile phone that you have

314
00:17:47,630 --> 00:17:51,330
the email address for where Yahoo
security standards

315
00:17:51,330 --> 00:17:54,580
property male that makes it pretty
fingers

316
00:17:54,580 --> 00:17:58,520
I think the kids call them sects mark
the texts

317
00:17:58,520 --> 00:18:03,320
yes make it on 6th um

318
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:07,860
so I am we have little to be I we're
gonna do a live demo

319
00:18:07,860 --> 00:18:11,250
and we're going to ask you to try and
hack us

320
00:18:11,250 --> 00:18:14,400
so we set up a open wifi nude call

321
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:20,280
Austin open known to Austin test demo

322
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:24,139
oh yeah it doesn't say open it says demo
Street it differently

323
00:18:24,140 --> 00:18:27,940
substitution it's an it's an cryptid it
says Austin and some other four letter

324
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:28,429
word

325
00:18:28,429 --> 00:18:33,770
K are you can me you can find it and
we're gonna do a a a call

326
00:18:33,770 --> 00:18:37,789
over this for the rest of the talk I
mean ask you to intercepted and try to

327
00:18:37,789 --> 00:18:38,650
break the encryption

328
00:18:38,650 --> 00:18:45,650
so our economy Michael are you coming

329
00:18:49,190 --> 00:18:52,980
know what's up a to are MJG

330
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:56,429
yep RN gg hours so we we were

331
00:18:56,429 --> 00:18:59,490
we get a four-letter dollar short on a
therefore where

332
00:18:59,490 --> 00:19:04,750
digit alphanumeric sure authentication
string and and that just a and we could

333
00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:06,760
talk to each other before that in the
clear sense

334
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:10,190
opportunistic encryption and and if

335
00:19:10,190 --> 00:19:13,870
we both agree that we see the same thing
on both sides we've agreed to do that

336
00:19:13,870 --> 00:19:17,630
and after that and address down to it as
RTP stream

337
00:19:17,630 --> 00:19:21,240
so are the voice data is now handcrafted
and

338
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:24,630
the signaling is encrypt it as well and

339
00:19:24,630 --> 00:19:27,970
the signaling is included with a
certificate authority

340
00:19:27,970 --> 00:19:32,510
an is it I'm and yeah rate you

341
00:19:32,510 --> 00:19:35,910
an exciting yet India cool as as good as
an attack that

342
00:19:35,910 --> 00:19:40,950
an so it's a yes is on and as you can
see said his very complicated as is

343
00:19:40,950 --> 00:19:44,130
everything else that it represents and
that and

344
00:19:44,130 --> 00:19:47,140
so to the stuff on the I am which

345
00:19:47,140 --> 00:19:50,500
stay stage red the right side

346
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:53,640
is on confidential cattle have

347
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:57,590
and is the a the voice stream and you
can see that the RTP

348
00:19:57,590 --> 00:20:01,590
a is that funny I think Asian protocol
it happens in the voice stream which is

349
00:20:01,590 --> 00:20:02,830
pretty interesting

350
00:20:02,830 --> 00:20:07,000
and the steps tough and is purely for
signaling and it's for setting up the

351
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:07,710
call

352
00:20:07,710 --> 00:20:12,090
I its you know bringing another person's
phone that person answering or not

353
00:20:12,090 --> 00:20:16,070
on hanging up a call and there's some
other stuff that can happen

354
00:20:16,070 --> 00:20:20,309
and for school features that the surf
are sip RFC describes which no one in

355
00:20:20,309 --> 00:20:20,590
the

356
00:20:20,590 --> 00:20:24,340
universe has implemented cludes other
planets

357
00:20:24,340 --> 00:20:27,620
and but yes other signaling stuff up
there

358
00:20:27,620 --> 00:20:31,390
on in in a in Austell and as well as
what the

359
00:20:31,390 --> 00:20:34,870
the open secured sweaty network spec and
requires

360
00:20:34,870 --> 00:20:38,630
is on as you have to and encrypt as well
cuz you can learn a lot from Sep

361
00:20:38,630 --> 00:20:39,230
hatter's

362
00:20:39,230 --> 00:20:43,380
and especially about IP addresses are
the calling party's

363
00:20:43,380 --> 00:20:47,510
an so I'll we're doing that through

364
00:20:47,510 --> 00:20:51,929
I running a certificate authority and on
the server itself

365
00:20:51,929 --> 00:20:55,900
and and that was a kinda design
constraint

366
00:20:55,900 --> 00:20:59,549
for the back end which is FreeSWITCH an

367
00:20:59,549 --> 00:21:03,350
and FreeSWITCH is a we really not doing
that much

368
00:21:03,350 --> 00:21:07,490
chose it because it happened the unpaid
new hat new asterisk in

369
00:21:07,490 --> 00:21:10,580
an and FreeSWITCH I was

370
00:21:10,580 --> 00:21:14,299
interesting and kinda noon new sex and
Alastair some weird

371
00:21:14,299 --> 00:21:19,500
you know baroque syntax an a but on it
does it does a lot

372
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:23,840
and Anna and most of the work that I did
was turning not a lot stuff off so

373
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:26,860
office which is doing is user
registration sale

374
00:21:26,860 --> 00:21:30,289
users can register and you can call them
and and and

375
00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:34,210
proxying the bankrupted bits just
transferring noise

376
00:21:34,210 --> 00:21:39,140
and so to the idea for open secure
telephone network is to really create

377
00:21:39,140 --> 00:21:42,620
a standard and develop a system that can
be

378
00:21:42,620 --> 00:21:45,630
interoperable on every mobile phone and
desktop platform

379
00:21:45,630 --> 00:21:48,830
and get them to play nice with each
other cock is currently there are a lot

380
00:21:48,830 --> 00:21:49,080
of

381
00:21:49,039 --> 00:21:52,110
piecemeal solutions or people working on
it

382
00:21:52,110 --> 00:21:55,640
I'm and making great strides but happen
really against

383
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:59,299
raise the bar and make it so that
anybody can launch

384
00:21:59,299 --> 00:22:02,470
their own Austin system on in

385
00:22:02,470 --> 00:22:06,659
a federated architecture so that I
anybody who wants their own

386
00:22:06,659 --> 00:22:10,240
similar to the way the email had worked
before

387
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:14,530
so many of us had move to the cloud
right you could create your own server

388
00:22:14,530 --> 00:22:18,740
install it establish a email address

389
00:22:18,740 --> 00:22:22,450
and neck easily federate and communicate
with any the other

390
00:22:22,450 --> 00:22:25,840
guys are out there and mister I mean it
and I think the point is that that's

391
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:28,760
that like work the email metaphors
important is that an option

392
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:32,140
unlike the the suffered out there the
particles are are

393
00:22:32,140 --> 00:22:37,059
are open and MTA's their number vent is
to choose from you can't do that

394
00:22:37,059 --> 00:22:40,620
and and many people do do that and and

395
00:22:40,620 --> 00:22:44,990
and but for VoIP you know the the tools
are also out there and one of one of our

396
00:22:44,990 --> 00:22:48,059
high-level assertions is that you can't
do that as well

397
00:22:48,059 --> 00:22:51,649
and and just like people run their own
email servers could run your own

398
00:22:51,650 --> 00:22:54,750
Voice over IP service

399
00:22:54,750 --> 00:22:57,750
and so our example abyss is Austell

400
00:22:57,750 --> 00:23:01,049
so if you scan a QR code you can
download the

401
00:23:01,049 --> 00:23:04,679
the Android app arm morning if you have
seized it simple

402
00:23:04,679 --> 00:23:07,980
it'll ask you to get rid of it I so that
it works

403
00:23:07,980 --> 00:23:11,610
it's it's also a non-market source said
so its experimental

404
00:23:11,610 --> 00:23:15,340
and it's earned nightly build from a
while ago was the most stable when we

405
00:23:15,340 --> 00:23:16,020
could find

406
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:19,730
and with the rebranding as you have to
have no market sources enabled

407
00:23:19,730 --> 00:23:23,280
and we've been working with the simple
and a if you

408
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:27,149
take a new one of the trunk it actually
I have inflation wizard

409
00:23:27,150 --> 00:23:30,580
connected to it and called Austin
question

410
00:23:30,580 --> 00:23:34,470
called Austin this version unfortunately
has some bugs with the

411
00:23:34,470 --> 00:23:37,580
I'm say an engine so if you want to

412
00:23:37,580 --> 00:23:40,740
pick a new one it might have better
interoperability but again we're

413
00:23:40,740 --> 00:23:45,179
kinda young as a project and so trying
to push in a long time

414
00:23:45,179 --> 00:23:49,070
are really get although the pieces
moving in and working together

415
00:23:49,070 --> 00:23:52,559
yeah and interestingly and in part a on
murder the

416
00:23:52,559 --> 00:23:55,668
third third first phase was was research

417
00:23:55,669 --> 00:24:00,140
and and it was was a lot harder than I
thought I just doing the research to

418
00:24:00,140 --> 00:24:04,840
to train like like figure out how this
stuff works and I have

419
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:09,720
worked professionally and i buy bill to
see like with another person in 2005 so

420
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:10,480
I can

421
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:14,650
a I thought that I knew how support and
and then like but the

422
00:24:14,650 --> 00:24:18,679
you know going into a doing doing
photography

423
00:24:18,679 --> 00:24:22,700
a with all these different protocols a
is where the challenge started

424
00:24:22,700 --> 00:24:27,590
and it has really low coverage and
especially in FreeSWITCH the

425
00:24:27,590 --> 00:24:32,149
the city alas and a source code has
really low coverage in theirs

426
00:24:32,150 --> 00:24:34,730
there's currently a memory leak in the
version of research that I'm running

427
00:24:34,730 --> 00:24:35,700
because I love

428
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:40,100
till a suffragist rations and and I just
restarted and that's the solution

429
00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:43,559
and bada and you know ads that was

430
00:24:43,559 --> 00:24:49,039
and I just just Mia figuring out how to
put all the pieces together

431
00:24:49,039 --> 00:24:53,080
and coherently on was a big challenge

432
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:56,600
so the their actual client development
and that

433
00:24:56,600 --> 00:25:00,250
is assertive the next phase sets its its
experimental

434
00:25:00,250 --> 00:25:04,240
and I'm and I look forward to doing some
work late development to make it so it's

435
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:05,470
like you know

436
00:25:05,470 --> 00:25:08,860
for example features like registering
for an account in app

437
00:25:08,860 --> 00:25:12,309
and and I will get it looked like a
client that's in the markets the

438
00:25:12,309 --> 00:25:15,440
subsample has all sorts of really cool
features in the trunk now

439
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:19,440
and that I'd like to take advantage of
and working out those bugs

440
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:23,230
and the the the SIP system

441
00:25:23,230 --> 00:25:26,419
arm with the TLS I mean is beneficial
because

442
00:25:26,419 --> 00:25:29,960
its it allows for layers of encryption
om

443
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:33,960
in case a system failure at any given
point oh and it's also an interesting

444
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:34,770
little

445
00:25:34,770 --> 00:25:38,559
up like state-of-the-art kind of hack
right now

446
00:25:38,559 --> 00:25:41,610
there there's been reports have certain
certain countries doing

447
00:25:41,610 --> 00:25:46,429
I am and support filtering like outgoing
traffic filtering on port 5060 which is

448
00:25:46,429 --> 00:25:47,710
the plaintext support

449
00:25:47,710 --> 00:25:52,220
and a so it's like you know if you're in
a country that does that mean

450
00:25:52,220 --> 00:25:55,940
nationally than you can't make 4 calls
are it work spatter whatever

451
00:25:55,940 --> 00:25:59,880
an and fortunately said till ass or
surpass

452
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:04,559
and is a on port 5061 win

453
00:26:04,559 --> 00:26:08,330
never figured I'll never figure that out
phil never even seen a stock

454
00:26:08,330 --> 00:26:11,570
sheesh arm

455
00:26:11,570 --> 00:26:15,320
and if you look at the all-star side it
doesn't look fancy

456
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:18,510
and that's kinda the point it is just
like any other

457
00:26:18,510 --> 00:26:23,020
work line on the user interface is just
like what you'd expect with phone

458
00:26:23,020 --> 00:26:26,250
I'm except for this added alphanumeric
string

459
00:26:26,250 --> 00:26:30,080
which does this year to be i connect on
and allows for that

460
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:33,408
verification that you have to the PP
encryption

461
00:26:33,409 --> 00:26:36,690
hi at the same time underneath the skin

462
00:26:36,690 --> 00:26:40,070
it actually works better than what we
have come to expect with phones

463
00:26:40,070 --> 00:26:43,678
I'm the codex that we've implemented
actually lower for

464
00:26:43,679 --> 00:26:46,779
high-quality voice accusations about you

465
00:26:46,779 --> 00:26:50,179
can here people in very crisp way

466
00:26:50,179 --> 00:26:53,340
which been a problem with that telephone
companies for

467
00:26:53,340 --> 00:26:56,820
very and low there's why bending their
offense a.m.

468
00:26:56,820 --> 00:27:00,200
the if you're on wifi the default Kodak
on is

469
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:04,110
is what is it at seven a 64 kilobits

470
00:27:04,110 --> 00:27:08,399
a sinner 6 yes 64 and KPTV

471
00:27:08,399 --> 00:27:11,820
kbps and mono sixteen-bit

472
00:27:11,820 --> 00:27:15,480
so it sounds good and then and the
default they're a band is speaks

473
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:20,730
at 8k kilobits am but interestingly this
is nine implemented this is

474
00:27:20,730 --> 00:27:24,899
a very experimental there's a really
cool project called codec to

475
00:27:24,899 --> 00:27:28,580
out there own and just give some
background

476
00:27:28,580 --> 00:27:32,600
a voice codecs are one of the big
problems %uh Voice over IP cuz there are

477
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:33,450
so many of them

478
00:27:33,450 --> 00:27:37,169
and there's also a very wide range a
band with constraints and some of the

479
00:27:37,169 --> 00:27:40,820
more sophisticated systems will
dynamically adjust codecs and get rates

480
00:27:40,820 --> 00:27:41,840
and stuff and that's been

481
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:45,399
echoes on the way back to like real
player and stuff like that and for your

482
00:27:45,399 --> 00:27:45,909
non

483
00:27:45,909 --> 00:27:49,539
a synchronous her communication am

484
00:27:49,539 --> 00:27:53,879
but I am and so you know winds in
situations like

485
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:58,350
you know to a bit more at like 10 with
constraint is constrained environments

486
00:27:58,350 --> 00:28:01,390
or like have contested

487
00:28:01,390 --> 00:28:04,150
territories are governments are
something you might not be guaranteed

488
00:28:04,150 --> 00:28:06,559
even he killed its per second so

489
00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:09,770
collect use a research project that when
and kind of like

490
00:28:09,770 --> 00:28:13,600
paper in patent trolling and from the
80's and looked up

491
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:17,410
a this this guy forget his name I
should've that but look for collective

492
00:28:17,410 --> 00:28:20,480
David Rowe

493
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:23,690
and David Rowe and looked up a bunch of
a

494
00:28:23,690 --> 00:28:26,960
algorithms for speech coding from
eighties and our

495
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:31,240
and found that a lot of them were public
domain and unfortunately all other

496
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:32,320
algorithms that made

497
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:35,320
made your voice sound good were patented

498
00:28:35,320 --> 00:28:38,750
and sale it's a work in progress but

499
00:28:38,750 --> 00:28:43,200
ideally like it it is INSEE said simple
right now as a available Kodak

500
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:46,210
and stare examples and on the web

501
00:28:46,210 --> 00:28:49,460
above 1.2 kilobits per second

502
00:28:49,460 --> 00:28:52,740
Voice so that's pretty cool so

503
00:28:52,740 --> 00:28:55,910
our version a Austin hours TN

504
00:28:55,910 --> 00:28:59,200
is Austell ob anybody can replicate this
and

505
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:02,530
create no 2600 or and any other one

506
00:29:02,530 --> 00:29:06,350
on what's exciting is that for the pack
for me currently don't work

507
00:29:06,350 --> 00:29:09,580
on every platform so its functioning on

508
00:29:09,580 --> 00:29:13,340
Android iPhone blackberry I'm simeon

509
00:29:13,340 --> 00:29:16,860
mac/pc and minutes so if you wanna make

510
00:29:16,860 --> 00:29:20,309
included call between any of those
systems you can

511
00:29:20,309 --> 00:29:24,629
and I heard you to go to the wiki I'm
and you can find all

512
00:29:24,630 --> 00:29:27,850
through Austell dot me we can register
for account

513
00:29:27,850 --> 00:29:31,480
for the week go to the wiki and find out
exactly what client works on which

514
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:33,990
platform what is the licensing on the
client

515
00:29:33,990 --> 00:29:37,330
how open is it how trust that is it how
much should be supported

516
00:29:37,330 --> 00:29:41,230
on and how to then install it and make
fun calls with for

517
00:29:41,230 --> 00:29:45,720
your from the moslems yeah and and and I
should note that the

518
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:48,990
on the sign up process right now on a

519
00:29:48,990 --> 00:29:52,020
is and looking and looking into
developing new like new and more

520
00:29:52,020 --> 00:29:52,920
interesting ways

521
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:56,370
for signing up for an account and rather
than visiting a web page

522
00:29:56,370 --> 00:29:59,790
an ideally should be able to sign up for
an account here I think that would be

523
00:29:59,790 --> 00:30:01,210
awesome there's a couple of

524
00:30:01,210 --> 00:30:04,400
authentication mechanisms and dad I'm
I'm

525
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:08,230
looking into but I haven't quite decided
on when you're and we're trying to make

526
00:30:08,230 --> 00:30:09,970
it as easy as possible so that

527
00:30:09,970 --> 00:30:12,550
you don't necessarily need a phone
number because again even the phone

528
00:30:12,550 --> 00:30:13,370
number is

529
00:30:13,370 --> 00:30:17,370
thinking in a way that's prescribed arm
we have twitter handles we had

530
00:30:17,370 --> 00:30:20,770
email accounts we have all sorts of
other schisms either

531
00:30:20,770 --> 00:30:24,389
personal identification you can opt into
I'm can I just

532
00:30:24,390 --> 00:30:27,700
by knowing your Twitter account search
call you on that

533
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:31,190
I'm were have other ID

534
00:30:31,190 --> 00:30:34,800
aliases you know where the aliens like
every link in email and call your email

535
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:35,429
address

536
00:30:35,429 --> 00:30:39,470
mobile the alias a your your your phone
identity

537
00:30:39,470 --> 00:30:43,360
with ater take some kinda token that's
the thats known somewhere else

538
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:48,310
arm so there are some problems with it

539
00:30:48,310 --> 00:30:51,450
I that we've encountered while building
a system

540
00:30:51,450 --> 00:30:54,830
hot for being one of them and there are
some others

541
00:30:54,830 --> 00:30:58,090
so Guardian project for his work
intimately with war

542
00:30:58,090 --> 00:31:01,090
reporting them onto the internet
platform are creating

543
00:31:01,090 --> 00:31:04,350
or bot which this is a lovely icon for

544
00:31:04,350 --> 00:31:07,830
I'm and or Web and creating and ability
for

545
00:31:07,830 --> 00:31:11,500
any app to integrate poor into their
workings

546
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:14,570
I'm most recently and and and largely

547
00:31:14,570 --> 00:31:17,629
Twitter is actually open themselves up
so you can now

548
00:31:17,630 --> 00:31:21,120
run not Twitter over towards thankfully
I am

549
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:24,600
but with Boyce it becomes a little bit
more complicated

550
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:27,730
year you can't do you TP over tour

551
00:31:27,730 --> 00:31:30,780
and there's that just like up

552
00:31:30,780 --> 00:31:34,520
the the latency up going through that
many proxies like like literally by

553
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:35,330
design

554
00:31:35,330 --> 00:31:38,899
and you can't do synchronous teeway and

555
00:31:38,900 --> 00:31:42,230
data there's just too many bounces
around too much him

556
00:31:42,230 --> 00:31:45,620
but but there's potential for

557
00:31:45,620 --> 00:31:49,200
things like up push to torque I'll what
if we could have a

558
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:52,300
a push to talk system that runs over
tore arm

559
00:31:52,300 --> 00:31:55,450
based on the systems and protocols that
we've already been developing

560
00:31:55,450 --> 00:31:58,790
I have those are the Push to Talk
systems its

561
00:31:58,790 --> 00:32:02,649
it's funny cuz like I when I first and
and found out that there's all these

562
00:32:02,650 --> 00:32:04,600
mobile handsets in China that have the
psych

563
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:08,400
Voice SMS Push to Talk features as a
girl like a walkie talkie awesome

564
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:13,070
and then I saw one working it's like 0
this is this is awesome like it its

565
00:32:13,070 --> 00:32:15,010
military shows up like SMS

566
00:32:15,010 --> 00:32:18,450
and you know you require little voice
messages and it's like near real time

567
00:32:18,450 --> 00:32:21,340
just like you can have text
conversations but it's with place and

568
00:32:21,340 --> 00:32:23,120
it's literally a global walkie-talkie

569
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:28,460
its sweet mom in addition to having to
hack free switch itself

570
00:32:28,460 --> 00:32:32,900
a the RTP is not a standard it's kind i
mean

571
00:32:32,900 --> 00:32:36,540
there's a zpack there's a specification
in a reference implementation

572
00:32:36,540 --> 00:32:39,580
that so Zimmerman wrote and

573
00:32:39,580 --> 00:32:44,320
but yeah that people's implementations
aren't really standardized cell

574
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:47,939
minutes and it's very young as a a.m. as
a protocol so they're

575
00:32:47,940 --> 00:32:51,429
I think you know HTTP went through a lot
of growing pains

576
00:32:51,429 --> 00:32:54,800
you're saying that the main gym library
is working up patches

577
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:58,840
yeah sir to the official release others
ENTP

578
00:32:58,840 --> 00:33:03,400
implementation and in see some simple
which is using a Java library comp PJ

579
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:04,120
set

580
00:33:04,120 --> 00:33:07,610
which is using a patch that from the
project from the canoe

581
00:33:07,610 --> 00:33:11,300
CRT PC pp c plus plus library

582
00:33:11,300 --> 00:33:15,669
that does your TP and is a literally a

583
00:33:15,669 --> 00:33:19,770
a patch that that goes that applies to
you a specific release a PJ said

584
00:33:19,770 --> 00:33:23,379
nets the official release cell hoops

585
00:33:23,380 --> 00:33:27,340
and we found it really important to work
together with a lot of the

586
00:33:27,340 --> 00:33:30,720
boy clients that are coming out that are
trying to

587
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:35,690
I bring in the RTP because otherwise is
just not going to be interoperability

588
00:33:35,690 --> 00:33:39,159
and as it develops further and they go
grow further apart

589
00:33:39,159 --> 00:33:42,580
going to be decreasing me a headache are
so it's been great to work with

590
00:33:42,580 --> 00:33:46,700
people like private wave I am here their
implementations because we've had a lot

591
00:33:46,700 --> 00:33:47,730
of issues with

592
00:33:47,730 --> 00:33:51,320
a codex not working out I and
communicate with each other and figuring

593
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:53,010
out okay Harry finagle

594
00:33:53,010 --> 00:33:56,080
that this is a simple library and there

595
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:59,250
the open for standard to make sure the
its robust enough

596
00:33:59,250 --> 00:34:03,570
but also for them to to play nice with
with us as well and allow for that

597
00:34:03,570 --> 00:34:06,820
all to grow whether it's a proprietary

598
00:34:06,820 --> 00:34:10,659
for-profit system or just you know you
the open source available to everyone

599
00:34:10,659 --> 00:34:13,950
I meant there there a a lot of and

600
00:34:13,949 --> 00:34:19,299
political barriers for interoperability
is well specially in the Codex pace

601
00:34:19,300 --> 00:34:23,620
and through through patents and and just
platforms

602
00:34:23,620 --> 00:34:27,250
Blake can there there's a a lot of the

603
00:34:27,250 --> 00:34:31,350
I O S clients use I and is gonna call a
quick time I don't do anyhow as

604
00:34:31,350 --> 00:34:32,529
development I don't know if

605
00:34:32,530 --> 00:34:36,899
quick time mister like you know API but
your QuickTime doesn't support

606
00:34:36,899 --> 00:34:42,388
a any odd codex at all and sell their go
speak such as a default narrowband kodak

607
00:34:42,389 --> 00:34:44,359
but it does support some other one said

608
00:34:44,359 --> 00:34:47,259
that there's a there's a lotta there
there's there's certain interrupt Billy

609
00:34:47,260 --> 00:34:49,450
barriers that are not just technical

610
00:34:49,449 --> 00:34:53,158
but you know where their their solutions
to them and that's part of the project

611
00:34:53,159 --> 00:34:54,050
is to

612
00:34:54,050 --> 00:34:57,609
a to second define better define their
solutions

613
00:34:57,609 --> 00:35:01,330
and document them and the technology
right now is

614
00:35:01,330 --> 00:35:05,880
is very young we just been implementing
an arm so security might have its own

615
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:07,550
lapses in issues

616
00:35:07,550 --> 00:35:12,140
om but you can there's there's a benefit
in using voice because you can actually

617
00:35:12,140 --> 00:35:15,810
be engineering attacks be if your voice
sounds fun right at somebody have a gun

618
00:35:15,810 --> 00:35:16,420
to your head

619
00:35:16,420 --> 00:35:20,850
then your voice changes attended I'm so
that there are layers and layers of

620
00:35:20,850 --> 00:35:21,470
security

621
00:35:21,470 --> 00:35:24,470
as we the woman

622
00:35:24,470 --> 00:35:27,830
yeah it's indigenous it's interesting
and as one of those things that that's

623
00:35:27,830 --> 00:35:28,740
that's subtle

624
00:35:28,740 --> 00:35:32,350
and and and sometimes taken for granted
or not experts like not not acknowledged

625
00:35:32,350 --> 00:35:33,000
and

626
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:37,160
in that and so so when I was talking
about before with like it all the SIP

627
00:35:37,160 --> 00:35:38,460
signaling is using

628
00:35:38,460 --> 00:35:42,940
a in SL on actually is this a cell not a
less

629
00:35:42,940 --> 00:35:47,170
and an a certificate authority and
that's the server so tirelessly not

630
00:35:47,170 --> 00:35:50,210
signed by root CA so it's not gonna quit
trusted

631
00:35:50,210 --> 00:35:55,810
and but so someone jacks are signaling
and the costal works for whatever reason

632
00:35:55,810 --> 00:35:59,660
it doesn't matter really because if the
car works you can talk to the person on

633
00:35:59,660 --> 00:36:00,779
the other line

634
00:36:00,780 --> 00:36:04,090
and if you know them then

635
00:36:04,090 --> 00:36:07,359
you know you can move on and do the your
TP negotiation and then

636
00:36:07,359 --> 00:36:10,370
you're still assured have a private
conversation an

637
00:36:10,370 --> 00:36:13,580
other actual a.m. you know audio bits
and

638
00:36:13,580 --> 00:36:17,200
on if you don't recognize them or if you
don't wanna talk to and you can just

639
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:19,680
hang up

640
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:22,940
what about in her to GSM

641
00:36:22,940 --> 00:36:26,810
interest to GSM is a fun subject head
and we haven't done any

642
00:36:26,810 --> 00:36:30,650
any a any development and that level yet

643
00:36:30,650 --> 00:36:33,940
an open BTS is a really awesome projects

644
00:36:33,940 --> 00:36:37,160
an and I s its a

645
00:36:37,160 --> 00:36:40,710
essentially a I am and it's a

646
00:36:40,710 --> 00:36:43,950
GSM transceiver and and on

647
00:36:43,950 --> 00:36:47,580
on the other end is a a sip register

648
00:36:47,580 --> 00:36:50,810
see register you know so you get a bunch
of phones

649
00:36:50,810 --> 00:36:54,190
with GSM service earn and they

650
00:36:54,190 --> 00:36:58,350
connect to the BTS station and they
register to

651
00:36:58,350 --> 00:37:02,100
in this case like no FreeSWITCH are
asterisk or open steps

652
00:37:02,100 --> 00:37:05,319
and or any of the other separatist ours
and so it's kinda like

653
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:08,600
like that the idea during a trip to Jess
Ennis definitely

654
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:12,700
a possibility and it's an interesting
one though there

655
00:37:12,700 --> 00:37:16,850
more than just technical barriers and
with that as well

656
00:37:16,850 --> 00:37:20,500
and like it's illegal

657
00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:27,070
so here's the question i can be replaced
talk on company

658
00:37:27,070 --> 00:37:30,770
and a yep running para GSM service

659
00:37:30,770 --> 00:37:34,700
is complicated because for one its you

660
00:37:34,700 --> 00:37:38,020
depending on what state what light like
you know nationality your

661
00:37:38,020 --> 00:37:43,000
people onto it and then turn up the heat
it's illegal it's just call it like that

662
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:46,260
or or what country you're in om mean
wanna

663
00:37:46,260 --> 00:37:50,200
the issues is up needing radio spectrum

664
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:54,220
and in countries like Iraq radio
spectrum is unregulated and

665
00:37:54,220 --> 00:37:58,109
don't be so you can actually just bill
that experiment with it row it

666
00:37:58,109 --> 00:38:02,920
and see how we can actually scale on so
there there are options for

667
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:06,240
for doing for in the states am

668
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:09,859
a and you know center so if you buildup
in BTS system

669
00:38:09,859 --> 00:38:13,380
it's a suffer radio so you can you know
you can broadcast on

670
00:38:13,380 --> 00:38:17,800
whatever frequency your radio supports
an there's certain frequencies that

671
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:21,750
and it's illegal to broadcast on and a
for example you could

672
00:38:21,750 --> 00:38:25,730
basically could become an AT&T you know
broadcaster be in a trance

673
00:38:25,730 --> 00:38:30,910
transceiver and iPhones will wander
around here just some network

674
00:38:30,910 --> 00:38:34,500
arm 12 goals with a always TN is to

675
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:37,700
get appearing in Federation happening om
but fundamentally

676
00:38:37,700 --> 00:38:41,400
appearing in Federation is hard and the
telephone companies figure this out

677
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:44,589
and that's how they were able to scale
are really hugely

678
00:38:44,589 --> 00:38:48,640
and they did using towns which is why
we're all here

679
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:51,720
I'll we're trying to figure out how to
read

680
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:55,790
take something like that and implement
that in our system

681
00:38:55,790 --> 00:38:58,980
yeah and in like II what are the reasons
I I

682
00:38:58,980 --> 00:39:02,150
lil really like the email metaphor is as
this one

683
00:39:02,150 --> 00:39:05,550
and you know even email anyone has run
and and

684
00:39:05,550 --> 00:39:09,470
an MTA a with the search certain amount
of users now said

685
00:39:09,470 --> 00:39:13,720
emails it could be pretty hard I mean is
kinda easy but it's still pretty tired

686
00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:15,839
and it's kinda awesome that works

687
00:39:15,839 --> 00:39:18,900
and just like it's awesome that you can
cause someone around the world learn

688
00:39:18,900 --> 00:39:19,350
with

689
00:39:19,350 --> 00:39:23,279
you know the PSTN and it works and they
sold a lot of really hard scalability

690
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:24,330
problems

691
00:39:24,330 --> 00:39:27,410
and so the goal is like you know like so
if we want to replace

692
00:39:27,410 --> 00:39:31,240
like the you know that public switched
telephone network

693
00:39:31,240 --> 00:39:34,780
a a at addressing is big deal

694
00:39:34,780 --> 00:39:38,320
I'm not like IP addressing but like no
contact and resting

695
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:41,650
and there's no there there are a lot of
projects

696
00:39:41,650 --> 00:39:44,830
that and but attempt to address this

697
00:39:44,830 --> 00:39:49,100
and there's no standard again this is a
very conflicted space

698
00:39:49,100 --> 00:39:52,150
and and one other one of the reasons is
that because it easier

699
00:39:52,150 --> 00:39:55,290
did a telco like sydell psych

700
00:39:55,290 --> 00:39:59,320
they don't wanna interoperate with you
think it's in their best interests

701
00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:02,510
a like financially to to not do that

702
00:40:02,510 --> 00:40:05,620
and so so making things like peering
easy is

703
00:40:05,620 --> 00:40:11,810
is like like it would be with email and
is Nick fundamentally different

704
00:40:11,810 --> 00:40:15,710
arm and so even FreeSWITCH when you're
back in court doesn't necessarily make

705
00:40:15,710 --> 00:40:17,470
sense to continue to develop on

706
00:40:17,470 --> 00:40:20,859
to or not aren't necessarily stuck with
that solution

707
00:40:20,859 --> 00:40:24,270
might lead to other things right open
Sep and otherwise so yes

708
00:40:24,270 --> 00:40:27,720
some stuff it's simpler and I did you
know that the real

709
00:40:27,720 --> 00:40:32,300
that the backend stuff like this hiii
put on a researcher Karndean to it an

710
00:40:32,300 --> 00:40:36,180
and and through that I discovered that
the less back n stuff the better

711
00:40:36,180 --> 00:40:40,370
and unfortunately like working with this
type of voice over IP NAT is a huge

712
00:40:40,370 --> 00:40:41,190
issue

713
00:40:41,190 --> 00:40:44,650
on skype solved it by being likened like
a de OS

714
00:40:44,650 --> 00:40:48,130
service in just slamming your network
with a buncha stuff to figure out hello

715
00:40:48,130 --> 00:40:51,460
what's going on and but I am you know
having at

716
00:40:51,460 --> 00:40:56,109
proxying bits is the easiest waiting get
through a lot of NAT issues

717
00:40:56,109 --> 00:41:00,660
on and there are probably people in the
audience who have had one way audio

718
00:41:00,660 --> 00:41:04,450
on various types of phone calls and
thats that's a common

719
00:41:04,450 --> 00:41:10,330
problem with with NAT and and so is he
still needs in backend infrastructure

720
00:41:10,330 --> 00:41:15,000
I'd like to have as much in here as
possible and ideally peer to peer but

721
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:18,770
that's you know that's for the future
and you gonna register somewhere

722
00:41:18,770 --> 00:41:25,770
you got a story or contact lists and see
you can call other people

723
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:31,430
so we have more be I can you build your
own

724
00:41:31,430 --> 00:41:35,460
telephoning network we created this back
Austin is there

725
00:41:35,460 --> 00:41:40,250
I you can see the code can you actually
build the 2600

726
00:41:40,250 --> 00:41:44,150
network or what up her other network you
want payment

727
00:41:44,150 --> 00:41:48,190
and actually implemented and then we can
work together on the Federation issue

728
00:41:48,190 --> 00:41:52,460
either through towns or otherwise
developing few tens but that would be

729
00:41:52,460 --> 00:41:53,200
novel

730
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:56,740
and yes oh this is a I i'm Anna

731
00:41:56,740 --> 00:42:01,270
in in my other my other at had federal
assistance architecture

732
00:42:01,270 --> 00:42:05,069
and I really like a framework of Chef I
want pimp that here

733
00:42:05,069 --> 00:42:09,400
they know that that's a kinda not OK
thing to talk about with a buncha for

734
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:12,930
geeks but I am so I read a chef cookbook
that for FreeSWITCH

735
00:42:12,930 --> 00:42:17,060
an that a automates down

736
00:42:17,060 --> 00:42:20,819
as taking a Linux server I did on Debian
and

737
00:42:20,819 --> 00:42:23,839
don't go into as well I think the
package names in the cut but perot

738
00:42:23,839 --> 00:42:26,900
are are okay and but there might be some
like you know

739
00:42:26,900 --> 00:42:30,160
little differences in the package names
but nothing fundamentally different

740
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:33,200
and and you can get your own FreeSWITCH

741
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:36,880
set up with all other bad stuff turned
off and of the security stuff

742
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:41,109
enabled it builds a root CA I'm on that
server for you

743
00:42:41,109 --> 00:42:44,380
and if you wanna distribute that root
certificate tell your clients you may do

744
00:42:44,380 --> 00:42:45,010
so

745
00:42:45,010 --> 00:42:48,500
if not you can just trusted but it's an

746
00:42:48,500 --> 00:42:51,100
it's an important distinction because it
doesn't generate a self-signed SSL

747
00:42:51,100 --> 00:42:52,410
certificate actually

748
00:42:52,410 --> 00:42:56,190
is a legitimate root certificate
authority and

749
00:42:56,190 --> 00:43:00,870
and a I if you're going to do this the
most important thing you need

750
00:43:00,870 --> 00:43:03,880
is a fully qualified domain name down

751
00:43:03,880 --> 00:43:07,420
and really literally that's all you need
if the server that if your chef

752
00:43:07,420 --> 00:43:11,600
run running on a the server and you have
a fully qualified domain name in it

753
00:43:11,600 --> 00:43:12,550
resolves

754
00:43:12,550 --> 00:43:16,280
and and you know what yes it as long as
it resolves

755
00:43:16,280 --> 00:43:19,490
an Niko's named Ash F pound

756
00:43:19,490 --> 00:43:23,359
works and then the literally no
interaction

757
00:43:23,359 --> 00:43:27,339
you will have a running FreeSWITCH
surfer with all these secure by default

758
00:43:27,339 --> 00:43:28,270
stuff and

759
00:43:28,270 --> 00:43:32,259
and enabled and and with no users
there's even a script to generate

760
00:43:32,260 --> 00:43:35,470
some users for you

761
00:43:35,470 --> 00:43:38,510
arm so one issues is

762
00:43:38,510 --> 00:43:42,650
where you hosted and how do you insure
that is secure that the

763
00:43:42,650 --> 00:43:47,160
the house itself is not going to be
confiscated

764
00:43:47,160 --> 00:43:51,500
and yeah you can listed anywhere you
want even hosted on your phone

765
00:43:51,500 --> 00:43:54,670
a but you probably don't wanna do that
an

766
00:43:54,670 --> 00:43:58,339
and yeah so %um is on a WS is a is a
pretty common

767
00:43:58,339 --> 00:44:03,150
place to host on there's a %uh there's a
there's a is a complete called open

768
00:44:03,150 --> 00:44:03,819
hosting

769
00:44:03,819 --> 00:44:07,440
that I just have to kinda a.m. you know
talk but a little

770
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:10,970
the full disclosure I i have worked with
some of the founders

771
00:44:10,970 --> 00:44:15,580
and but they're really cool and they red
they're they're they're smaller they're

772
00:44:15,580 --> 00:44:16,810
getting they're getting started

773
00:44:16,810 --> 00:44:20,839
they have a really a cool feature where

774
00:44:20,839 --> 00:44:24,279
and they're running KVM as their
virtualization a system

775
00:44:24,280 --> 00:44:27,470
and you can upload a rocky new in
original bid for you so it's really

776
00:44:27,470 --> 00:44:30,000
cause you can like this can make your
own servers on your

777
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:33,580
laptop and just send it to them know
budem and where you can use a bunch a

778
00:44:33,580 --> 00:44:34,890
predefined systems

779
00:44:34,890 --> 00:44:38,140
down and they have like the serial BIOS
things you can actually see here

780
00:44:38,140 --> 00:44:41,310
you know in it doing stuff in talk to
the bias

781
00:44:41,310 --> 00:44:45,710
and over the NC and so they have a lot
of kinda clever stuff that goes outside

782
00:44:45,710 --> 00:44:46,920
of the Amazon metaphor

783
00:44:46,920 --> 00:44:50,010
and our storage is really fast and I can
go on and on but on

784
00:44:50,010 --> 00:44:54,520
and so yet but you know really any any
server that has a fully qualified domain

785
00:44:54,520 --> 00:44:55,210
name

786
00:44:55,210 --> 00:44:59,030
in Houston and win in 15 minutes wish me
to questions

787
00:44:59,030 --> 00:45:02,760
with alright let's get to that and on
this double issue with the

788
00:45:02,760 --> 00:45:06,210
the clients also discuss them for us we
found that

789
00:45:06,210 --> 00:45:10,359
this is that simple our trunk release
from moves really fast

790
00:45:10,359 --> 00:45:14,200
on and working with the actual
certificate authorities

791
00:45:14,200 --> 00:45:18,089
causes issues depending on which mines
AAA you can use commercial Sears for

792
00:45:18,089 --> 00:45:18,580
this

793
00:45:18,580 --> 00:45:22,830
and it's the FreeSWITCH thing and you
can but it's that it's broken

794
00:45:22,830 --> 00:45:26,040
so our question is how do we get this
and everybody's hands

795
00:45:26,040 --> 00:45:29,970
literally as well as figuratively how
can the design challenge about be

796
00:45:29,970 --> 00:45:30,819
overcome

797
00:45:30,819 --> 00:45:34,470
so we need developers testers
translators designers

798
00:45:34,470 --> 00:45:38,370
I and we're looking to build us pretty
knock-on

799
00:45:38,370 --> 00:45:41,529
as such with this a growing Wikia

800
00:45:41,530 --> 00:45:45,000
information did that details the

801
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:49,970
trials and tribulations up implementing
for two boys as well as establishing our

802
00:45:49,970 --> 00:45:53,500
code book for the laws a each country to
say

803
00:45:53,500 --> 00:45:56,990
whether you can have your own open BTS
for the you can have your own telefony

804
00:45:56,990 --> 00:46:00,390
I wanted dangerous points in
interception and we found

805
00:46:00,390 --> 00:46:04,790
arm and and otherwise and we want to do
some shout out thank you's

806
00:46:04,790 --> 00:46:08,620
before reacted Q&A I am so

807
00:46:08,620 --> 00:46:12,620
thanks to you I J'Covan Brown pills and
remand moxie

808
00:46:12,620 --> 00:46:16,430
private wave who's in Kentucky that net
arm

809
00:46:16,430 --> 00:46:19,890
Telenor werner said satyr and the that
her

810
00:46:19,890 --> 00:46:23,029
hers she change her chin J can help a
lot with and

811
00:46:23,030 --> 00:46:28,940
with an authentication stuff

812
00:46:28,940 --> 00:46:33,049
%uh how did you know that was the last
time

813
00:46:33,049 --> 00:46:36,049
who would arm

814
00:46:36,049 --> 00:46:41,359
our previous yes so you're going to have
a comp class are

815
00:46:41,359 --> 00:46:44,759
yet miss Nets made may get have username
letter A and that you know that's the

816
00:46:44,760 --> 00:46:45,089
whole

817
00:46:45,089 --> 00:46:48,180
ever I have a couple other cookbooks and
their it's a

818
00:46:48,180 --> 00:46:51,500
you know it's not perfectly organist
right now that the freeze which one is

819
00:46:51,500 --> 00:46:52,720
the most important than that

820
00:46:52,720 --> 00:46:55,790
and that will help the has a read me
with documentation at

821
00:46:55,790 --> 00:46:58,940
a lot of what I said and you can email
us directly in

822
00:46:58,940 --> 00:47:02,470
we we're happy to answer questions or
otherwise and there's a blog post on

823
00:47:02,470 --> 00:47:03,859
Guardian project that info

824
00:47:03,859 --> 00:47:08,180
that details the twelve-step program a
setting up your own a St N

825
00:47:08,180 --> 00:47:12,480
all right let's go to the Q&A the really
interesting idea

826
00:47:12,480 --> 00:47:16,020
are I and and I very much favor the
general

827
00:47:16,020 --> 00:47:19,400
you know by deploying no alternative to
Leslie

828
00:47:19,400 --> 00:47:23,569
infrastructure arm I 0 TP Singh is

829
00:47:23,569 --> 00:47:26,160
is is a little worrisome to me i i
didn't actually know that existed

830
00:47:26,160 --> 00:47:28,810
because I kept my head down for too long

831
00:47:28,810 --> 00:47:32,910
when you started mentioning it I I Brett
the RSC

832
00:47:32,910 --> 00:47:38,129
during the talks and I like the fact
that John Kalisz is associated with it

833
00:47:38,130 --> 00:47:41,120
the fact that fills in women is
associated with it makes me want to run

834
00:47:41,120 --> 00:47:42,690
in the other direction

835
00:47:42,690 --> 00:47:47,420
arm and I I don't dislike cell has been
a very long time but the

836
00:47:47,420 --> 00:47:51,839
the the described mode and in fact I
read in the

837
00:47:51,839 --> 00:47:55,170
the icy I can break this if I can do it

838
00:47:55,170 --> 00:47:59,160
in a few minutes a thought the
professional certainly can

839
00:47:59,160 --> 00:48:03,020
on you might want to think about a about
alternative ways

840
00:48:03,020 --> 00:48:07,069
securing the communications because this
is no absolutely necessary thing to do

841
00:48:07,069 --> 00:48:07,890
and deploy

842
00:48:07,890 --> 00:48:11,089
and in finding things where

843
00:48:11,089 --> 00:48:15,089
it's a little bit harder to do you man
in the middle attacks

844
00:48:15,089 --> 00:48:18,040
and to do traffic analysis I I'm
especially concerned about traffic

845
00:48:18,040 --> 00:48:19,569
analysis possibles

846
00:48:19,569 --> 00:48:22,680
because this act the part to fix a
conversation isn't clear to the extent

847
00:48:22,680 --> 00:48:24,819
that the other person is recognizable

848
00:48:24,819 --> 00:48:28,319
you can do automated traffic analysis to
the extent that they're not

849
00:48:28,319 --> 00:48:33,620
recognizable I can you mend so you're
going to lose one way or the other

850
00:48:33,620 --> 00:48:37,710
yes so to a good cryptanalysis earth
CITP implementations would be

851
00:48:37,710 --> 00:48:41,819
really awesome I injured realize it I'm
not gonna break it that way

852
00:48:41,819 --> 00:48:45,560
why deafening encourage as much work as
possible to

853
00:48:45,560 --> 00:48:48,740
get to that level improve it and it is a

854
00:48:48,740 --> 00:48:53,420
developing technology and and it is out
in the open for a reason

855
00:48:53,420 --> 00:49:00,420
on and a you can only be made better

856
00:49:01,299 --> 00:49:04,819
he armor and eggs and when the founders
about sale

857
00:49:04,819 --> 00:49:09,330
on I'm currently work that's the labs
actually setting up to open BTS network

858
00:49:09,330 --> 00:49:10,060
it burning

859
00:49:10,060 --> 00:49:13,460
been doing for the last several years so
if anybody's going this year

860
00:49:13,460 --> 00:49:17,549
public buzzer camp arm so many after
here why

861
00:49:17,549 --> 00:49:21,220
have two microphones and phone echo
cancellation um

862
00:49:21,220 --> 00:49:24,870
there is a legitimate reason um and

863
00:49:24,870 --> 00:49:28,009
we've been taught to work with over with
our weather RTC

864
00:49:28,010 --> 00:49:31,390
arm wanted to hear your thoughts on on
that

865
00:49:31,390 --> 00:49:34,890
project in in hell on how your stuff
like play with her

866
00:49:34,890 --> 00:49:39,009
whether RTC that would be the bar

867
00:49:39,010 --> 00:49:43,510
and yeah and there is a demo said client
written in way back to see

868
00:49:43,510 --> 00:49:48,660
and and I tried to register into I start
at me with my account had failed and

869
00:49:48,660 --> 00:49:50,450
assuming that's because it's not doing

870
00:49:50,450 --> 00:49:53,850
as secure Sep and at doesn't mean it's

871
00:49:53,850 --> 00:49:58,529
you can't bird on yeah like I that
that's really in next level is getting

872
00:49:58,529 --> 00:50:01,779
and and doing a lot of browser-based
telephony

873
00:50:01,779 --> 00:50:05,690
and Google's already done that with
they're using a Java plugin but doing it

874
00:50:05,690 --> 00:50:07,660
with web RTC would be

875
00:50:07,660 --> 00:50:10,859
the the super hotness on and

876
00:50:10,859 --> 00:50:14,180
me now to three academic commoditized
enough if if

877
00:50:14,180 --> 00:50:18,560
if you can do to secure level I won't
get into JavaScript photography that

878
00:50:18,560 --> 00:50:23,170
that the interdict talk on that and a
couple to discover but a if

879
00:50:23,170 --> 00:50:26,319
if yes back in if that is attainable
then

880
00:50:26,319 --> 00:50:30,660
and it pretty much commoditized a secure
place

881
00:50:30,660 --> 00:50:33,879
Weber to see yet so maybe this is a

882
00:50:33,880 --> 00:50:38,299
question that's removed from one layer
from you guys May bit more for the BTS

883
00:50:38,299 --> 00:50:39,310
people but

884
00:50:39,310 --> 00:50:42,770
have been any part into using

885
00:50:42,770 --> 00:50:45,890
white space %uh for for the purpose love

886
00:50:45,890 --> 00:50:49,839
using a you know a good years and
network or or something like that

887
00:50:49,839 --> 00:50:53,910
and opinions and is white space for
supper I have haven't I don't know

888
00:50:53,910 --> 00:50:55,580
you're talking up

889
00:50:55,580 --> 00:50:58,609
sorry that that suspect from usage

890
00:50:58,609 --> 00:51:01,609
where arm so this is just me

891
00:51:01,609 --> 00:51:06,290
maybe another person to be talking about
this but basically using

892
00:51:06,290 --> 00:51:09,900
%uh spectrum that's arm unused in

893
00:51:09,900 --> 00:51:14,680
so FCC's recently transfer along testing
on this and there's

894
00:51:14,680 --> 00:51:18,290
there's been rules that's been arm
establish about it where

895
00:51:18,290 --> 00:51:21,720
kinda stupidly they're requiring

896
00:51:21,720 --> 00:51:27,080
you know geographical I databases words
like okay here

897
00:51:27,080 --> 00:51:30,190
yet yeah and then without a beer that
would be awesome I don't

898
00:51:30,190 --> 00:51:33,589
from I'm from memory I don't know too
much about the the commercial

899
00:51:33,589 --> 00:51:36,920
the spectrum allocation and but I know
that there probably is some

900
00:51:36,920 --> 00:51:40,130
white space I like that term I haven't
heard it before and

901
00:51:40,130 --> 00:51:44,290
right now in terms of the that testing
any this is very much

902
00:51:44,290 --> 00:51:47,770
not verifiably secure on our side where

903
00:51:47,770 --> 00:51:51,730
implementing it saying this is now for
this is not ready four field way

904
00:51:51,730 --> 00:51:54,799
arm and so as we talk about the security

905
00:51:54,799 --> 00:51:58,270
figure out okay when can we start to
actually put our stamp on it and say yes

906
00:51:58,270 --> 00:51:59,540
this is ready for

907
00:51:59,540 --> 00:52:03,200
game time I'm where exploring whether we
can

908
00:52:03,200 --> 00:52:06,740
tested one for college Hong working on
on mesh networking

909
00:52:06,740 --> 00:52:10,640
no can redirect to a mesh network have
that just as part

910
00:52:10,640 --> 00:52:13,850
a know in an emergency or any specific
case

911
00:52:13,850 --> 00:52:18,080
I'm and how we have a more wide release
on it

912
00:52:18,080 --> 00:52:21,270
almond yeah I think white space also is

913
00:52:21,270 --> 00:52:27,500
is figuring out wherein the spectrum can
we play with our inspector

914
00:52:27,500 --> 00:52:30,589
yeah where and see mentioned

915
00:52:30,589 --> 00:52:34,660
knows that this is the software open
source this is somehow it's not

916
00:52:34,660 --> 00:52:35,410
and

917
00:52:35,410 --> 00:52:38,440
what is the guy and brought it to you
just guys

918
00:52:38,440 --> 00:52:41,530
right reading this straight times the
company

919
00:52:41,530 --> 00:52:44,680
world so in terms of the

920
00:52:44,680 --> 00:52:49,110
a a free verse is not free the Guardian
projects and and is

921
00:52:49,110 --> 00:52:52,390
do's the the sponsor and

922
00:52:52,390 --> 00:52:56,890
yet that's that's where we I'm week
we're working with the Guardian project

923
00:52:56,890 --> 00:53:01,900
pan and I am in terms of serve

924
00:53:01,900 --> 00:53:05,550
a point just went blank 30 project is a

925
00:53:05,550 --> 00:53:09,050
company based here in New York and where
mostly android-developers

926
00:53:09,050 --> 00:53:12,390
I'm and otherwise building out secure

927
00:53:12,390 --> 00:53:16,120
attack baby I have to have been is very
precious is not a company

928
00:53:16,120 --> 00:53:19,279
it's an open source project it's totally
ephemeral

929
00:53:19,280 --> 00:53:23,140
your and and we have various companies
in grants and stuff but

930
00:53:23,140 --> 00:53:27,180
we're not happen yeah everyone in here's
part of the Guardian project whether

931
00:53:27,180 --> 00:53:31,960
you're here funded for a product for a
specific project or not and but oh yes

932
00:53:31,960 --> 00:53:33,790
so in terms of third-party applications
where

933
00:53:33,790 --> 00:53:37,250
where on at work we're developing open
source software

934
00:53:37,250 --> 00:53:40,260
answering using C sub simple as our
baseline

935
00:53:40,260 --> 00:53:44,150
and the Austell a application as the
sort of proof that

936
00:53:44,150 --> 00:53:48,080
it works and that is hun are completely
open source and there might be some

937
00:53:48,080 --> 00:53:50,910
proprietary codecs in there but I don't
think so FM pics in there

938
00:53:50,910 --> 00:53:54,210
and but on in terms of proprietary
software

939
00:53:54,210 --> 00:53:57,980
those third parties were not developing
them and the protocols are open

940
00:53:57,980 --> 00:54:01,750
a.m. on I O S at the the most mature

941
00:54:01,750 --> 00:54:05,130
a third party app Scott ground wire on
it's a

942
00:54:05,130 --> 00:54:08,400
it casts ten dollars and then you have
to pay a $25 dollar

943
00:54:08,400 --> 00:54:12,240
enterprise service tax to get the RTP
support for outgoing calls

944
00:54:12,240 --> 00:54:15,500
it's kinda ridiculous business plan down
in my opinion but

945
00:54:15,500 --> 00:54:18,560
you know it's working and it gives you
and they deserve enterprise features as

946
00:54:18,560 --> 00:54:19,770
the market they're going for

947
00:54:19,770 --> 00:54:23,759
and private jets and there's a and the
product from

948
00:54:23,760 --> 00:54:27,010
a company called private wave and that
said I

949
00:54:27,010 --> 00:54:29,990
I'm their base a summer in Italy and

950
00:54:29,990 --> 00:54:33,240
and that runs on ans I think

951
00:54:33,240 --> 00:54:36,650
all of the raid I a Symbian blackberry

952
00:54:36,650 --> 00:54:41,250
I've I O S and Android which requires a
license

953
00:54:41,250 --> 00:54:44,280
radio yet which requires a license
that's also proprietary but we're not

954
00:54:44,280 --> 00:54:45,569
developing any of those

955
00:54:45,569 --> 00:54:50,359
we're just working with the authors
