1
00:00:00,049 --> 00:00:03,720
a survey at UAB hacks and exploits
resent River Tam

2
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:10,720
and Parker Higgins thanks

3
00:00:12,389 --> 00:00:15,610
solo and in December 2008

4
00:00:15,610 --> 00:00:19,000
after apprehending an alleged militant I

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,090
US military personnel in Iraq discovered
a problem that can quite figure out

6
00:00:23,090 --> 00:00:27,369
%uh a laptop on other suspects contain
video files

7
00:00:27,369 --> 00:00:30,840
%uh aerial surveillance footage at the
area it seem to be the same type of

8
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:32,200
footage that the US was

9
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:36,260
capturing via drones they didn't know
exactly where it came from

10
00:00:36,260 --> 00:00:39,910
but US investigators had evidence is
wasn't a one-time deal

11
00:00:39,910 --> 00:00:43,700
so then about six months later in July
2009

12
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:48,129
the military started finding more drawn
videos on other militant laptops

13
00:00:48,129 --> 00:00:51,519
time so

14
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:53,989
local there we go

15
00:00:53,989 --> 00:00:58,200
most of the evidence found in iraq most
the evidence was found in Iraq but then

16
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:00,030
they started finding John video feeds

17
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:05,309
on militants in Afghanistan as well and
so officials eventually concluded that

18
00:01:05,309 --> 00:01:07,170
they were regularly intercepting his
feeds

19
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:11,350
sometimes in real time but given we
would assume that

20
00:01:11,350 --> 00:01:14,580
the wood US operates the most
sophisticated drone technology in the

21
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:15,130
world

22
00:01:15,130 --> 00:01:18,619
and they have virtually unlimited budget
to stop hackers

23
00:01:18,619 --> 00:01:21,950
you would think in that

24
00:01:21,950 --> 00:01:27,090
they wouldn't run into these problems so
what was this sophisticated technology

25
00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:27,820
that these

26
00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:31,020
suppose it insurgent super genius is
refusing to get all this top secret

27
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:31,660
footage

28
00:01:31,660 --> 00:01:35,530
well turns out they're using
off-the-shelf software that you can buy

29
00:01:35,530 --> 00:01:37,410
for twenty six dollars

30
00:01:37,410 --> 00:01:42,740
so this is called this is called sky
grabber which at the time you could buy

31
00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:44,530
for $29.95

32
00:01:44,530 --> 00:01:48,360
on this it's a Russian company and I

33
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:51,679
what does usually is it intercepts

34
00:01:51,679 --> 00:01:55,450
and assembles data from satellite
networks and people use it to pick up

35
00:01:55,450 --> 00:02:00,789
movies or music are even pornography but
the Iraqi militants found out that they

36
00:02:00,789 --> 00:02:01,750
could

37
00:02:01,750 --> 00:02:05,220
arm intercept these large files been
tryn transmitted

38
00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:08,639
from the drone pilot to the to the
actual vehicle

39
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:11,910
and what had happened was

40
00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:15,370
the US was actually using and
unencrypted did communications link

41
00:02:15,370 --> 00:02:16,680
between the John the pilot

42
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:21,900
on and it turns out they actually known
about this problem

43
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:24,970
for more than a decade they had II drawn

44
00:02:24,970 --> 00:02:28,200
the day for start using drones and
bosnian the nineteen nineties

45
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:31,910
but the pentagon assume that local
advisors wouldn't figure out how to

46
00:02:31,910 --> 00:02:32,920
explain it

47
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:36,209
so

48
00:02:36,209 --> 00:02:40,489
you know these militants hacked these
drones

49
00:02:40,489 --> 00:02:43,610
they seal basically like somebody hack
in my Facebook feed

50
00:02:43,610 --> 00:02:50,610
if I was to be logged in it at the Apple
Store and so what why didn't they fix

51
00:02:50,950 --> 00:02:52,790
this when I knew about more than decade

52
00:02:52,790 --> 00:02:57,329
well they said it would cost too much
and they would cause delays in their

53
00:02:57,330 --> 00:02:58,680
bombing campaign so

54
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:02,780
and I they decided just to leave it be
and hope nothing went wrong

55
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:05,990
and so the Wall Street Journal reported
this couple years ago

56
00:03:05,990 --> 00:03:09,830
and they concluded like this they said
additional concerns remain about the

57
00:03:09,830 --> 00:03:12,080
vulnerability of the communication
signals

58
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:15,780
to electronic jamming though there's no
evidence that occurred

59
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:19,150
so cut to two years later

60
00:03:19,150 --> 00:03:23,350
in so in December of 2011

61
00:03:23,350 --> 00:03:27,730
iran claimed to have taken down a US
drone in iranian airspace

62
00:03:27,730 --> 00:03:30,990
and they do this not by shooting now the
sky but

63
00:03:30,990 --> 00:03:35,310
with their cyber warfare team now this
drone is known as an

64
00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:39,270
RQ 17 E and it's a it's a stealth
surveillance drone that's one of the

65
00:03:39,270 --> 00:03:39,690
most

66
00:03:39,690 --> 00:03:44,410
top secret and sophisticated in the US
arsenal just to give you an idea I've

67
00:03:44,410 --> 00:03:47,790
the kind technology we're talking about
at the US reportedly use when he's

68
00:03:47,790 --> 00:03:48,989
arguing seventies

69
00:03:48,990 --> 00:03:52,530
to spy on Osama bin Laden's hideout in
Pakistan before he was killed

70
00:03:52,530 --> 00:03:57,620
so US officials came out with statements
at the drones flying over Afghanistan

71
00:03:57,620 --> 00:03:59,410
and that it belonged to the

72
00:03:59,410 --> 00:04:04,640
army by that was an entirely true I'm
just days after the first story

73
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:08,240
US officials were forced to admit that
the drone was piloted by the CIA

74
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:12,420
and that it was flying surveillance
missions over Iran but then they

75
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:15,850
insisted that it didn't happen that they
just lost control and was a mechanical

76
00:04:15,850 --> 00:04:16,668
malfunction

77
00:04:16,668 --> 00:04:20,959
so not withstanding the Wall Street
Journal article from two years prior

78
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:25,060
serb security experts assured us that it
was almost impossible for these drones

79
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:26,340
to be taken down remotely

80
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:30,310
arm and so we've got a quote from at
seven security expert

81
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:33,560
I James Lewis who worked in the reagan
administration he said

82
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:37,229
Iran hacking into these drones is about
as likely as an I had people were

83
00:04:37,229 --> 00:04:38,530
standing on a mountaintop

84
00:04:38,530 --> 00:04:42,880
and using thought waves to bring it down
the most likely explanations that crash

85
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:43,810
in town

86
00:04:43,810 --> 00:04:49,639
so I given that the drone crashed landed
in the iranian desert

87
00:04:49,639 --> 00:04:53,530
you'd expect that the US would surely
release photos of the wreckage

88
00:04:53,530 --> 00:04:57,840
drone pieces strewn across a landscape
on well actually

89
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:01,810
iran is one release a picture and here's
the crash drone completely intact

90
00:05:01,810 --> 00:05:04,900
but

91
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:08,580
in the same report lewis also said if
you can hack into a drone

92
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:13,240
you wouldn't use it for some spontaneous
fine you'd save it for a rainy day

93
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:17,349
I you need to be able to hack either the
control network in the US or satellite

94
00:05:17,349 --> 00:05:20,729
neither is easy in both are probably
something the iranians can do

95
00:05:20,729 --> 00:05:24,370
not probably not something Iran's can do
so

96
00:05:24,370 --> 00:05:27,580
notwithstanding roses or a funny idea of
a rainy day

97
00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:31,508
up let's come back that arm if the
Iranians

98
00:05:31,509 --> 00:05:35,409
can't hack the ground network for the
satellites how that drone in the coming

99
00:05:35,409 --> 00:05:37,759
down

100
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:41,800
well that's one of the questions we plan
to address turn in stock first I i want

101
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,240
to do some quick introductions

102
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:47,249
I my name is Parker Higgins and this is
Trevor Tim

103
00:05:47,249 --> 00:05:50,729
and we're both activist for the
Electronic Frontier Foundation

104
00:05:50,729 --> 00:05:53,919
at together we also operate the at
drones to intervene

105
00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:57,339
which is dedicated to spreading news and
views about drones

106
00:05:57,339 --> 00:06:02,580
at home and overseas on the yet that is
probably familiar to most have you for

107
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:05,248
not some rather work but recently we've
been paying

108
00:06:05,249 --> 00:06:08,430
a lot of attention to the situations
with drones

109
00:06:08,430 --> 00:06:12,559
and especially domestic drones and so
we're going to save time for questions

110
00:06:12,559 --> 00:06:13,490
but

111
00:06:13,490 --> 00:06:18,219
for the next half hour so will be
explaining how widespread runs are today

112
00:06:18,219 --> 00:06:22,219
and how the number then is set to
explode in the next couple years

113
00:06:22,219 --> 00:06:25,509
then we'll talk a bit about what sorts
security systems

114
00:06:25,509 --> 00:06:30,409
on and problems that military incident
civilian drones are facing today

115
00:06:30,409 --> 00:06:33,759
house in these might be resolved in the
future and house on them re: been

116
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:35,379
exploited

117
00:06:35,379 --> 00:06:38,999
finally will turn the tables for a bit
and talk about the role of drones

118
00:06:38,999 --> 00:06:42,699
and especially amateur drones from the
DIY sector in Explorer

119
00:06:42,699 --> 00:06:46,919
beaten exploiting other vulnerabilities

120
00:06:46,919 --> 00:06:50,650
so I guess we'll take a step back here
for second talk about exactly why the

121
00:06:50,650 --> 00:06:52,919
strong dollar bill is so important

122
00:06:52,919 --> 00:06:57,568
on and just how expansive John uses so
in a recent congressional report

123
00:06:57,569 --> 00:07:01,789
at the military revealed it has about
7,500 rounds

124
00:07:01,789 --> 00:07:05,210
right now on this number came out a
couple months ago and it's probably re:

125
00:07:05,210 --> 00:07:06,249
out-of-date

126
00:07:06,249 --> 00:07:09,949
are the most popular drone the Army has
is called The Raven

127
00:07:09,949 --> 00:07:14,389
which you can see here they have over
5000 of them and you can see that they

128
00:07:14,389 --> 00:07:15,969
take off by having

129
00:07:15,969 --> 00:07:19,740
on someone in the Army throw them in the
air up but the

130
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:23,309
the most and so nearly a one in three
drones

131
00:07:23,309 --> 00:07:26,580
are 13 planes in the air force right now
are drones

132
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:30,058
and just a couple years ago those five
percent on

133
00:07:30,059 --> 00:07:34,020
and in the next year so they will
actually start raining more pilots to

134
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:37,188
fly drones an actual manned aircraft

135
00:07:37,189 --> 00:07:41,749
on so the the drone that everybody is
familiar with is called the predator

136
00:07:41,749 --> 00:07:45,509
on which is being used in Pakistan Yemen
and elsewhere

137
00:07:45,509 --> 00:07:48,809
and then the Reaper which is the
Predators bigger

138
00:07:48,809 --> 00:07:52,569
better-armed brother on

139
00:07:52,569 --> 00:07:55,939
and so the pentagon is also

140
00:07:55,939 --> 00:07:59,009
just to give you an idea above how vital
these are two

141
00:07:59,009 --> 00:08:02,569
what they consider I'm Portman military
missions their

142
00:08:02,569 --> 00:08:05,939
considering giving bravery medals to
drone pilots who operate thousands of

143
00:08:05,939 --> 00:08:08,490
miles from combat zones

144
00:08:08,490 --> 00:08:12,509
so not only have they been regularly use
in Afghanistan and Iraq

145
00:08:12,509 --> 00:08:15,580
Pakistan there's now a sustained bombing
campaign going on

146
00:08:15,580 --> 00:08:19,770
in Yemen and so the New York Times
now-famous the reported about a month

147
00:08:19,770 --> 00:08:20,469
ago

148
00:08:20,469 --> 00:08:24,619
about President Obama's kill list where
the president essentially assigns

149
00:08:24,619 --> 00:08:27,689
signs death warrants for terror suspects
in the region

150
00:08:27,689 --> 00:08:30,960
and some other included US citizens on
and so

151
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:35,130
in actually in Yemen and Pakistan the
bombing has expanded so broadly

152
00:08:35,130 --> 00:08:39,080
on this they're not just targeting a
high-value not terrorist targets

153
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:43,810
but also low-level are operatives were
with what are known as signature strikes

154
00:08:43,810 --> 00:08:47,520
and signature strikes are when they
don't actually have intelligent grounder

155
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:48,149
using

156
00:08:48,149 --> 00:08:51,480
evidences patterns have life and so
amazingly

157
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:56,290
many times they don't even know what the
identity a few they're killing

158
00:08:56,290 --> 00:09:00,969
and so multiple John strikes last few
years %ah have been reported in somalia

159
00:09:00,970 --> 00:09:04,970
on the new york times actually confirmed
that US has been connect conducting

160
00:09:04,970 --> 00:09:07,110
drone strikes in the Philippines as well

161
00:09:07,110 --> 00:09:10,330
and they've been operating surveillance
programs

162
00:09:10,330 --> 00:09:14,670
across the Horn of Africa and now the
Carribean

163
00:09:14,670 --> 00:09:17,939
on but you would think the US has a
monopoly on the on drones and that

164
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:18,550
actual

165
00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:22,490
axe actually not true are not even close
there's actually a

166
00:09:22,490 --> 00:09:26,190
more than 50 countries have drones now
and the New York Times said that the

167
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:27,490
numbers rising every month

168
00:09:27,490 --> 00:09:32,149
you but you would think this problem
normally as an overseas problem

169
00:09:32,149 --> 00:09:35,680
are but actually drones are about to
invade the US more than any other

170
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:37,360
country in the world

171
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:41,120
right now actually the predator drones
without the missiles are operating on

172
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:45,980
the US and Canadian borders by home in
securing have been for a couple years

173
00:09:45,980 --> 00:09:51,459
are but the FAA is actually authorizing
local police agencies to use drones

174
00:09:51,459 --> 00:09:56,259
on their keeping as the secret the
amount love authorizations they had

175
00:09:56,259 --> 00:10:00,610
Rd issued but we at the FF filed a
Freedom of Information Act lawsuit

176
00:10:00,610 --> 00:10:04,829
a few months ago and they were forced to
release a list I have over 60 public

177
00:10:04,829 --> 00:10:07,060
agencies that already have them

178
00:10:07,060 --> 00:10:10,930
are but again that numbers about to
explode up congress

179
00:10:10,930 --> 00:10:14,980
thanks to a clause written and inserted
by the drone industry in a bill

180
00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:18,279
in February actually mandates that the
FAA

181
00:10:18,279 --> 00:10:22,480
give out licenses to any public agency
that wants them

182
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:26,190
as long as they can on prove that they
can find safely

183
00:10:26,190 --> 00:10:29,699
and on top of that homeland security
spending millions of dollars on a

184
00:10:29,699 --> 00:10:32,630
program to facilitate and accelerate

185
00:10:32,630 --> 00:10:35,790
these are drones by local police and so
the F

186
00:10:35,790 --> 00:10:39,139
FAA actually estimates there may be as
many as 30,000

187
00:10:39,139 --> 00:10:43,709
drones in the air by the end of the
decade just in the US alone

188
00:10:43,709 --> 00:10:47,970
so what exactly do we have to worry
about are buckley's do

189
00:10:47,970 --> 00:10:50,630
while US they're not going to be
shooting missiles at least the military

190
00:10:50,630 --> 00:10:51,610
kind

191
00:10:51,610 --> 00:10:55,769
and but they will come in all shapes and
sizes they'll be able to fly for hours

192
00:10:55,769 --> 00:10:57,240
or days at a time

193
00:10:57,240 --> 00:11:00,970
are some the military drones can scan
entire cities at one time

194
00:11:00,970 --> 00:11:05,990
or alternatively zoom in and read a milk
carton from sixty thousand feet

195
00:11:05,990 --> 00:11:09,639
they can be equipped with a facial
recognition software a crack in the WiFi

196
00:11:09,639 --> 00:11:10,940
networks

197
00:11:10,940 --> 00:11:15,019
they can act as cell phone towers
intercepted phone calls and text

198
00:11:15,019 --> 00:11:16,139
messages

199
00:11:16,139 --> 00:11:19,410
or lock into your GPS in your cell phone

200
00:11:19,410 --> 00:11:22,879
a Texas sheriff actually expressed
interest in sawing

201
00:11:22,879 --> 00:11:26,509
we calls Leslie the weapons like teasers
and rubber bullets

202
00:11:26,509 --> 00:11:31,149
for crowd control and the manufactures
actually freely admit that these drones

203
00:11:31,149 --> 00:11:33,529
are made to hold those types of weapons
for

204
00:11:33,529 --> 00:11:36,779
use in the US

205
00:11:36,779 --> 00:11:40,620
so now I understand how widespread runs
are might be able to go in the summer

206
00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:42,170
the explanations have white

207
00:11:42,170 --> 00:11:45,599
I different group are people mean when
they say the word rounds

208
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:51,100
and so one very specific definition
comes from your

209
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:56,040
comes from the FAA in congress who use
the term unmanned aircraft system

210
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:59,599
and he according to that definition
unmanned aircraft are

211
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:02,769
any aircraft operate without the
possibility have

212
00:12:02,769 --> 00:12:07,019
human intervention from within or on the
aircraft itself

213
00:12:07,019 --> 00:12:10,100
and an unmanned aircraft system is the
aircraft

214
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:13,660
and all the associated elements so the
ground stations such

215
00:12:13,660 --> 00:12:17,639
this is a very broad definition and
includes everything from

216
00:12:17,639 --> 00:12:22,329
RC planes to fall on predators I'm one
minor distinction they have

217
00:12:22,329 --> 00:12:26,149
is the use the term suas which is a
smaller system by the same name in

218
00:12:26,149 --> 00:12:31,360
anything wider than 55 pounds concern
suis

219
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:34,279
then there's also sorta the classic
robotics definition which is best

220
00:12:34,279 --> 00:12:35,829
articulated by scholars like

221
00:12:35,829 --> 00:12:39,629
ron kahler the University Washington law
school who does a lot a great running on

222
00:12:39,629 --> 00:12:40,430
drums

223
00:12:40,430 --> 00:12:44,560
in by their definition drones are
unmanned aircraft that have the

224
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:46,910
particular quality other tana me

225
00:12:46,910 --> 00:12:50,509
so that rules out most remote control
line and sigh

226
00:12:50,509 --> 00:12:56,100
hobby planes I'm but includes the sorts
a military and surveillance drones

227
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:59,620
that you might read about the paper hi
and in fact

228
00:12:59,620 --> 00:13:03,019
is being a time either been efforts
within the military to make the drone

229
00:13:03,019 --> 00:13:03,680
seem

230
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:08,339
even more time s one pentagon initiative
is working on redesigning the control

231
00:13:08,339 --> 00:13:10,319
mechanisms so the operators

232
00:13:10,319 --> 00:13:14,740
working on the ground in nevada or new
mexico controlling strike some 10,000

233
00:13:14,740 --> 00:13:16,000
miles away

234
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,649
might get to assign more the blame to
the drones itself and be less affected

235
00:13:19,649 --> 00:13:21,480
by the trauma of war

236
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:24,660
I sorta miss Siri kill this guy can I
think

237
00:13:24,660 --> 00:13:28,660
arm but for the most part during this
talk

238
00:13:28,660 --> 00:13:32,060
when we're speaking about the kind
that's where the drugs are vulnerable to

239
00:13:32,060 --> 00:13:36,370
we're gonna use a third definition one
that's more expensive in scope

240
00:13:36,370 --> 00:13:40,110
we include vehicles that are unmanned
whether or not they have a timely

241
00:13:40,110 --> 00:13:40,930
features

242
00:13:40,930 --> 00:13:44,899
and whether or not their aerial that may
seem counterintuitive cuz you know

243
00:13:44,899 --> 00:13:47,139
anything to drones Thomas eyes flying

244
00:13:47,139 --> 00:13:51,589
on by I Alexis include some systems I
had a lot of the same kinda

245
00:13:51,589 --> 00:13:54,610
vulnerabilities and that raise the same
kinds of issues

246
00:13:54,610 --> 00:13:58,579
for example we want to talk about your
Google self-driving cars are

247
00:13:58,579 --> 00:14:03,029
I the robot fish in submarines that are
being tested in oceans around the world

248
00:14:03,029 --> 00:14:07,730
insecticides nano drones that could be
deployed in swarms like this mosquito

249
00:14:07,730 --> 00:14:11,329
and small navy boat grounds

250
00:14:11,329 --> 00:14:16,029
in addition leader in this talk world
speak to someone a different kind

251
00:14:16,029 --> 00:14:20,540
love payload I and systems that can be
used on drones

252
00:14:20,540 --> 00:14:23,759
and how those are susceptible to
exploitation

253
00:14:23,759 --> 00:14:26,800
as the prices have sensors and related
hardware come down

254
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:30,660
we've seen all sorts and small computers
there have been or could be mounted on a

255
00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:31,250
drone

256
00:14:31,250 --> 00:14:36,199
with models like GPS units or wifi
cracking software install

257
00:14:36,199 --> 00:14:40,230
so remember the threat vectors that
cybersecurity expert James Lewis was

258
00:14:40,230 --> 00:14:43,990
was said in a story about the drone down
in Iran

259
00:14:43,990 --> 00:14:48,499
he said that you either need to to hack
a drone you can you control a network in

260
00:14:48,499 --> 00:14:49,759
the US

261
00:14:49,759 --> 00:14:53,279
or satellite and he said this is close
to impossible

262
00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:57,839
so let's look at how actually impossible
this is

263
00:14:57,839 --> 00:15:01,199
so I in October 2011

264
00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:05,579
the air force discovered a virus had
infected its fleet a predator

265
00:15:05,579 --> 00:15:08,790
and Reaper drones at a military base in
Nevada on

266
00:15:08,790 --> 00:15:12,769
the virus actually logging every good
keystroke the pallets made as as they

267
00:15:12,769 --> 00:15:13,839
flew from

268
00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:16,920
Afghanistan Iraq now they claim that the

269
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:20,899
by written prevent them from running a
missions or that no information have

270
00:15:20,899 --> 00:15:21,910
been lost her sense

271
00:15:21,910 --> 00:15:26,529
sent to an outside source but the virus
had actually resisted multiple efforts

272
00:15:26,529 --> 00:15:28,139
to remove it from the computers

273
00:15:28,139 --> 00:15:31,519
and here's the money quote that they
told wired

274
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:36,259
we kept wiping it off just keeps coming
back

275
00:15:36,259 --> 00:15:40,089
and so the all the Air Force ultimately
determined at least publicly that the

276
00:15:40,089 --> 00:15:41,680
virus was benign

277
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:48,209
you know one of those benign keyloggers
we always hear about

278
00:15:48,209 --> 00:15:51,560
so what's crazy is that the drone base
actually knew about the virus for two

279
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:55,420
weeks in at didn't even tell the air
force's cyber security team

280
00:15:55,420 --> 00:15:59,790
I'd actually learned about it from
reading wired

281
00:15:59,790 --> 00:16:03,910
I want the source the wired said it was
a highly last one when your article came

282
00:16:03,910 --> 00:16:04,499
out

283
00:16:04,499 --> 00:16:07,509
it was like what is this on

284
00:16:07,509 --> 00:16:11,449
cell what was the source of the virus
the military is quote

285
00:16:11,449 --> 00:16:16,100
not quite sure I they believe that
entered at some point

286
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:21,129
on from the wild but and they don't know
who specifically targeting the drones

287
00:16:21,129 --> 00:16:24,610
on but it entered through some other
process so

288
00:16:24,610 --> 00:16:28,790
that takes care love the head first half
a close quote so let's take a look at

289
00:16:28,790 --> 00:16:29,709
the second half

290
00:16:29,709 --> 00:16:34,589
US satellites on the they obviously
can't be hacked at all

291
00:16:34,589 --> 00:16:37,850
on so in 2008

292
00:16:37,850 --> 00:16:41,149
and according to a recent congressional
report

293
00:16:41,149 --> 00:16:46,040
and hackers interfered with to US
government satellites from a base in

294
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:47,589
Norway

295
00:16:47,589 --> 00:16:51,680
%uh the report didn't indicate exactly
what type of interference

296
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:55,620
on was achieved but they did say a quote
that the hackers

297
00:16:55,620 --> 00:16:58,800
achieved all steps required to command
the satellite they

298
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:03,180
they never actually exercised the
control though

299
00:17:03,180 --> 00:17:06,260
so in aside from from

300
00:17:06,260 --> 00:17:09,809
lewis's objections another major target
from for the drones

301
00:17:09,809 --> 00:17:12,920
is the GPS systems on board I

302
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:17,059
I wanna say now that you could easily
give a whole talk on GPS and securities

303
00:17:17,059 --> 00:17:20,270
and you could get very technical and
there are some very good ones in there

304
00:17:20,270 --> 00:17:24,449
I by I we can't go into that level
detail so I

305
00:17:24,449 --> 00:17:27,760
if you have questions I'm around
afterwards but its it some complex tasks

306
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:30,140
is gonna be a pretty high level overview

307
00:17:30,140 --> 00:17:33,160
arm first it may be useful to dry

308
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:36,930
a couple distinctions the first
distinctions between

309
00:17:36,930 --> 00:17:41,890
jamming in spoofing a GPS signal jamming
the signal is pretty much what it sounds

310
00:17:41,890 --> 00:17:42,559
like you can

311
00:17:42,559 --> 00:17:46,360
overwhelm the GPS sensors were signal so
the legitimate location information from

312
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:47,280
the satellites

313
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:50,750
is an able to get through ice moving as
little more complicated

314
00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:54,880
involves getting the GPS sensor to
follow a different signal

315
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:58,430
so GPS sensors lock onto the strongest
signal

316
00:17:58,430 --> 00:18:02,090
that they are receiving and they take
back to be the real signal

317
00:18:02,090 --> 00:18:05,679
on you can just introduce a stronger
signal and get the

318
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:09,520
get the GPS to follow it but you can
line up a strong fake signal

319
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:12,960
with their real signal and then start
making them dressed

320
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:16,890
you can make the GPS follow the fake
signal and at that point you've totally

321
00:18:16,890 --> 00:18:18,310
owned the grounds location

322
00:18:18,310 --> 00:18:22,060
and you can do whatever you want with it
on the second distinction that's

323
00:18:22,060 --> 00:18:23,480
important to drop between

324
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:27,410
at is between military and civilian GPS

325
00:18:27,410 --> 00:18:31,060
so nobody's demonstrated a spoofing
attack on military GPS and the signals

326
00:18:31,060 --> 00:18:33,700
encrypt it and so may not actually be
possible

327
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:37,790
on it's worth noting iran claims it
brought down the argue 17 E

328
00:18:37,790 --> 00:18:41,180
with this moving attack but most experts
are doubtful

329
00:18:41,180 --> 00:18:45,640
on civilian GPS is extremely vulnerable
is proving

330
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:48,800
and both civilian and military GPS can
be jammed

331
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:53,639
arm and this is really important because
drones rely completely on GPS for all

332
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:54,560
the navigation

333
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:58,450
so when you spoke the signal obviously
you can cause it to fall in new orders

334
00:18:58,450 --> 00:19:02,600
but when you jam the signal it can lead
to all sorts an unexpected behavior

335
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:07,560
arm smaller drones typically don't have
any sorted internal navigation system

336
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:10,950
so when they lose our GPS signal they go
into

337
00:19:10,950 --> 00:19:14,250
whatever sort of autonomous fallback
know they have I

338
00:19:14,250 --> 00:19:18,670
it you insert awesome name for their for
do at this point as zombie drowns

339
00:19:18,670 --> 00:19:22,690
arm by I its it's actually a pretty
scary thing so

340
00:19:22,690 --> 00:19:26,960
we can look at examples is the %uh this
plays out arm actual the big exciting

341
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:28,670
story did happen just recently

342
00:19:28,670 --> 00:19:33,210
I earlier this year at the University of
Texas GPS researcher

343
00:19:33,210 --> 00:19:36,640
I'm Todd Humphries perform the first

344
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:41,160
known successful hijacking a commercial
drown a this literally on a dare from

345
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:42,720
the Department of Homeland Security

346
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:46,090
any de moda at No DHS facilities on

347
00:19:46,090 --> 00:19:50,689
used equipment the cost almost a
thousand dollars to manufacture

348
00:19:50,690 --> 00:19:54,120
and software that he and another
researcher and written themselves and it

349
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:57,400
it took about four years about that
offer and

350
00:19:57,400 --> 00:20:01,610
so in the in the demo from I a hilltop
about half a mile from where the drones

351
00:20:01,610 --> 00:20:02,330
operating

352
00:20:02,330 --> 00:20:06,560
he was able to completely own it on
convincing the drone that it was rising

353
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:07,429
straight up

354
00:20:07,430 --> 00:20:10,890
and so the drone things right and
straight up it compensates

355
00:20:10,890 --> 00:20:14,230
I by making a beeline right for the
ground arm

356
00:20:14,230 --> 00:20:18,500
so SAT pilot in this case intervene but
but she had made his point

357
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:22,130
I these commercially manufactured drones
the kind that are

358
00:20:22,130 --> 00:20:25,890
set to cover the sky in the next few
years are totally vulnerable

359
00:20:25,890 --> 00:20:28,880
vulnerable to being hijacked from the
ground that's the one that all the

360
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:30,770
police department's gonna be fine

361
00:20:30,770 --> 00:20:34,250
on the Wired article on this event gave
the best advice

362
00:20:34,250 --> 00:20:40,800
that I've seen so far keep your head
down and wear helmet

363
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:43,800
on so professor humphries is I it

364
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:47,160
actually if you're interested in the GPS
talk you should look up some vids on

365
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:51,490
he's is I you know I agree GPS experts--
and he still optimistic

366
00:20:51,490 --> 00:20:55,080
about the way that the technology can
continue develop

367
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:58,639
but he's clear about how significant the
implications and up his

368
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:02,960
I was down on our he says I don't wanna
see drones coming into the National

369
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:06,130
Airspace before we pass this problem

370
00:21:06,130 --> 00:21:10,790
so spoofing is one form attack I but
jamming requires even less sophisticated

371
00:21:10,790 --> 00:21:11,690
tools

372
00:21:11,690 --> 00:21:15,640
and so as you might expect we've already
seen examples a bit in the wild

373
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:20,610
arm it turns out that North Korea is one
of the world's foremost jammers a GPS

374
00:21:20,610 --> 00:21:21,560
signals

375
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:25,770
and they've gotten their technology
mostly from Russia

376
00:21:25,770 --> 00:21:29,330
but they increases strength it so they
interferes with

377
00:21:29,330 --> 00:21:32,730
I signals over a radius at sixty miles

378
00:21:32,730 --> 00:21:36,560
I'm so they've set up trucks to jam GPS
by the border with South Korea

379
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:39,669
I and its had major real world impact
already

380
00:21:39,670 --> 00:21:43,570
in September last year at the North
Korean surprised the world with

381
00:21:43,570 --> 00:21:47,560
with more powerful GPS technologies and
we never seen them used before

382
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:51,740
and it forced unmanned US spy plane that
was involved in a joint us-south Korea

383
00:21:51,740 --> 00:21:52,490
exercise

384
00:21:52,490 --> 00:21:56,400
to make an emergency landing on and just
a few months later

385
00:21:56,400 --> 00:22:00,470
even more tragically in May of this year
jam GPS signals caused

386
00:22:00,470 --> 00:22:04,930
a cam copter ast 101 in the east and
there was being tested in South Korea to

387
00:22:04,930 --> 00:22:06,450
go into zombie mode

388
00:22:06,450 --> 00:22:10,360
and it crashed into the ground control
station and the crash killed one in the

389
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:11,040
engineers

390
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:14,720
that was that I had designed this and
injured the two remote pilots are

391
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:16,970
working in the station at the time

392
00:22:16,970 --> 00:22:21,380
arm and the north korean jamming has
been hard to pinpoint an address because

393
00:22:21,380 --> 00:22:25,110
the only use it intermittently and I and
its

394
00:22:25,110 --> 00:22:28,360
its interrupted over 600 civilian
flights in an hour

395
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:34,300
South Korea but so far the only crash
it's been tied to you is this round

396
00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:38,110
and that's not it I zombie don't really
have the potential to be a majorly

397
00:22:38,110 --> 00:22:39,170
disruptive problem

398
00:22:39,170 --> 00:22:42,960
especially as more and more drones are
sharing the sky with other planes

399
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:46,540
Department of Defense acknowledge the
problem in a recent report

400
00:22:46,540 --> 00:22:50,230
whose cover showed a map international
airspace withdrawn stations overlaid

401
00:22:50,230 --> 00:22:52,950
onto a map a flypast currently in use

402
00:22:52,950 --> 00:22:56,110
this is what it looked like

403
00:22:56,110 --> 00:22:59,830
and they're already been some near
misses with drones both in the US and

404
00:22:59,830 --> 00:23:01,669
overseas

405
00:23:01,670 --> 00:23:05,450
beaten for example one one German
surveillance drone

406
00:23:05,450 --> 00:23:09,130
out just barely missed colliding with
the civilian jet over Afghanistan

407
00:23:09,130 --> 00:23:16,130
to do surveillance drone had a camera on
it and so this was a picture

408
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:20,340
arm n so after that may have this last
year

409
00:23:20,340 --> 00:23:24,100
also in Afghanistan American military
cargo plane hit an American surveillance

410
00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:24,720
drone

411
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:28,240
and forced to make an emergency landing
force the the cargo plane to make an

412
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:30,240
emergency landing the drowned in make it

413
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:34,530
arm so and traditional air traffic
control systems

414
00:23:34,530 --> 00:23:38,210
you know it's been in in in place for
decades they assume the president's are

415
00:23:38,210 --> 00:23:41,720
a pilot whose interpreting visual cues
and behaving predictably

416
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:46,740
and so the systems don't stand up to the
did to these drones

417
00:23:46,740 --> 00:23:50,350
and of course they're just are not many
options when a drone gets out of touch

418
00:23:50,350 --> 00:23:52,000
unknowns on board

419
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:55,820
their few more crazy examples on the
drones in a while the laundry know about

420
00:23:55,820 --> 00:24:00,110
a few years back a Reaper flying combat
mission Afghanistan just dropped off the

421
00:24:00,110 --> 00:24:03,450
grid and had to be shot down by man
planes in the area

422
00:24:03,450 --> 00:24:07,020
the Reaper by the way we show before 12
the really big ones and it's on the

423
00:24:07,020 --> 00:24:07,600
order out

424
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:13,120
a 150 to 200 million dollars apiece so
it's a really expensive network drop out

425
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:16,530
on ended it's not just dangerous to

426
00:24:16,530 --> 00:24:19,600
whoever's in the sky RNY nearby on the
ground

427
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:24,200
the eastern m2 but these things carry
all kinds of technology in data that's

428
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:27,730
news really bad news in falls into the
wrong hands arm

429
00:24:27,730 --> 00:24:31,050
and the predator and Reaper they both
have

430
00:24:31,050 --> 00:24:35,470
remote wipe functionality but of course
if you lose contact with it there's no

431
00:24:35,470 --> 00:24:36,480
way of knowing

432
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:40,150
whether it works arm so in another
example

433
00:24:40,150 --> 00:24:43,160
back in summer up 2010 a drone rogue

434
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:46,650
over the restricted air spray airspace
in Washington DC

435
00:24:46,650 --> 00:24:49,980
so in this is a Fire Scout motto about
the size of a small helicopter

436
00:24:49,980 --> 00:24:54,220
you're flying around no one knows how to
control it I over Washington DC so

437
00:24:54,220 --> 00:24:58,810
a fighter jets almost had to be scramble
the day down but then just russians I'm

438
00:24:58,810 --> 00:25:02,090
on so GPS attacks are major problem

439
00:25:02,090 --> 00:25:05,439
and they're only poised to get worse um
by

440
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:09,050
before we move on to the section there's
one other factor by which are drawn from

441
00:25:09,050 --> 00:25:09,710
your own

442
00:25:09,710 --> 00:25:13,070
and its thirty you need to this is
physical attacks on

443
00:25:13,070 --> 00:25:16,290
as you can imagine that the physical
access problem is

444
00:25:16,290 --> 00:25:20,440
pretty severe with drones a for one
thing they're not very fast

445
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:24,300
the predators and Reapers are we showed
before they see menacing for sure but

446
00:25:24,300 --> 00:25:26,690
they max out at about a hundred miles
per hour

447
00:25:26,690 --> 00:25:29,820
or about as fast as wanted these on

448
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:32,970
in at in 1999

449
00:25:32,970 --> 00:25:37,270
and the during the the nato bombings
have your site via their drones in the

450
00:25:37,270 --> 00:25:37,740
air

451
00:25:37,740 --> 00:25:41,860
and the serbian air defense destroyed at
least 15 at them

452
00:25:41,860 --> 00:25:45,390
there's one report from then that's been
repeated lights never been officially

453
00:25:45,390 --> 00:25:46,190
confirmed

454
00:25:46,190 --> 00:25:49,820
that when the sister drones was
destroyed in a scene

455
00:25:49,820 --> 00:25:53,450
that sounds like it just has to come
from an action movie it was shot down

456
00:25:53,450 --> 00:25:54,820
with the machine gun

457
00:25:54,820 --> 00:26:01,060
fired from the opened or a helicopter
hovering next to it

458
00:26:01,060 --> 00:26:05,960
so there haven't been too many instances
yet up drone dogfight unmanned vehicles

459
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:09,580
by the picture doesn't look pretty for
them on

460
00:26:09,580 --> 00:26:13,590
just as one other example Charles
Krauthammer the continues a conservative

461
00:26:13,590 --> 00:26:14,680
American columnist

462
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:18,180
he's gone on the on-the-record against
drones in the US

463
00:26:18,180 --> 00:26:22,690
and his opposition might be an indicator
you have a how much the public feels

464
00:26:22,690 --> 00:26:25,960
he said I would say that you panic under

465
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:29,170
all circumstances and I would predict
I'm not encouraging

466
00:26:29,170 --> 00:26:32,510
but I'm predicting that the first guy
who use the Second Amendment weapon to

467
00:26:32,510 --> 00:26:35,020
bring a drone downed it's been hovering
over his house

468
00:26:35,020 --> 00:26:42,020
is going to be a folk hero in this
country

469
00:26:44,940 --> 00:26:48,940
so finally at we do want to take add
many questions we can but

470
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:52,530
on with the with the rest the time we
had before even the floor

471
00:26:52,530 --> 00:26:55,540
we do want to mention some other cool
ways that drones avenues and other

472
00:26:55,540 --> 00:26:57,260
exporters in alaska ways to

473
00:26:57,260 --> 00:27:01,360
on so the use of drones opens the door
to mounting

474
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:04,580
secure traditional attacks in manners
that I

475
00:27:04,580 --> 00:27:08,020
that build in a in a pretty exciting way
um

476
00:27:08,020 --> 00:27:11,950
and some these cases there's not a lot
new going on technically but there's

477
00:27:11,950 --> 00:27:15,510
definitely i'd gee-whiz factor and
because it's

478
00:27:15,510 --> 00:27:19,160
you manana find out machine arm so

479
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:23,940
the first thing I understand is that I
one most the drones being used by police

480
00:27:23,940 --> 00:27:26,210
stations in the military are very
expensive

481
00:27:26,210 --> 00:27:29,200
and they range from your tens of
thousand dollars for loan and lease

482
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:29,770
model

483
00:27:29,770 --> 00:27:33,420
200 the millions for the big predator
saudis

484
00:27:33,420 --> 00:27:37,830
there's an active community working on
hacking inexpensive drones and even

485
00:27:37,830 --> 00:27:39,490
making them from scratch

486
00:27:39,490 --> 00:27:43,090
so popular models like the parrot
ar.drone I

487
00:27:43,090 --> 00:27:47,060
are there just a few hundred dollars
they can be controlled with an iPhone or

488
00:27:47,060 --> 00:27:47,950
iPad

489
00:27:47,950 --> 00:27:52,020
and they come with I'm some building it
on me so they can loiter

490
00:27:52,020 --> 00:27:55,970
or or follow basic scripts if they get
out of range the controller

491
00:27:55,970 --> 00:27:59,980
arm the software that comes with even
comes with a Follow Me button

492
00:27:59,980 --> 00:28:03,610
at so when you hit you can have your own
army of drones follow you with either

493
00:28:03,610 --> 00:28:05,080
the GPS in the controller

494
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:09,899
or by logging onto you visually arm so
off-the-shelf they come with the camera

495
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:12,200
that transmits video live to the control
device

496
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:16,020
your iPad or your iPhone and hackers
have already started adding

497
00:28:16,020 --> 00:28:20,040
other sensors and payloads I and

498
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:23,440
of course building and flying RC point
RC planes

499
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:27,290
has been a popular hobby for decades but
what's changed is that the TAC has

500
00:28:27,290 --> 00:28:28,990
gotten much more advance

501
00:28:28,990 --> 00:28:32,460
and the sensors are way more
sophisticated and so

502
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:35,740
beyond these off-the-shelf models I

503
00:28:35,740 --> 00:28:39,370
there's a large and growing online
community called DIY drones

504
00:28:39,370 --> 00:28:43,110
that it develops a Tommy software and
plans for building drowns

505
00:28:43,110 --> 00:28:47,760
and planes quadrocopter have four rotors
and hectic opposite sex

506
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:51,650
mostly for less than a thousand dollars
and these things really have the cool

507
00:28:51,650 --> 00:28:52,490
hacker feel

508
00:28:52,490 --> 00:28:55,560
you it's all open source hardware and
free software

509
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:59,570
and I the people who are indigenous
community really dedicated to helping

510
00:28:59,570 --> 00:29:02,929
advance the state-of-the-art amateur
drowns on

511
00:29:02,930 --> 00:29:06,170
it's run by Chris Anderson whose the
editor in chief I've wired

512
00:29:06,170 --> 00:29:09,300
and so he runs this form and also I

513
00:29:09,300 --> 00:29:12,460
the the company that sells the official
kits but have

514
00:29:12,460 --> 00:29:16,810
you can get the kids ready where on and
he said that he's trying to kick off a

515
00:29:16,810 --> 00:29:17,649
revolution

516
00:29:17,650 --> 00:29:20,720
at following in the footsteps of the PC
revolution

517
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:24,040
he's trying to put the the word personal
into drones

518
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:29,340
on and of course you it's not just about
the construction this vehicle

519
00:29:29,340 --> 00:29:33,160
once you've got that you can put all
sorts have payloads on their

520
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:36,400
and people in the communities have
experiment with different things

521
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:40,840
on ok for example I one popular things
drones have been

522
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:44,490
equipped with wifi cracking or
interception software

523
00:29:44,490 --> 00:29:48,780
and so many many people in this room I'm
sure no about were driving

524
00:29:48,780 --> 00:29:51,960
on some people may have heard it for the
first time wind with the Google Street

525
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:53,050
View cars

526
00:29:53,050 --> 00:29:56,790
but just to catch a male stoppard on the
video arm

527
00:29:56,790 --> 00:30:00,580
the idea is that by cruising through
different wireless networks II

528
00:30:00,580 --> 00:30:03,949
and on any given walk in this city there
may be hundreds of them

529
00:30:03,950 --> 00:30:07,210
you can intercepted is being transmitted
in the clear or if you collect enough

530
00:30:07,210 --> 00:30:11,230
data you can use it to crack some other
less secure wifi encryption protocols

531
00:30:11,230 --> 00:30:14,870
and you can also course be back onto an
open network and you can use it to

532
00:30:14,870 --> 00:30:16,220
transmit data that would be

533
00:30:16,220 --> 00:30:19,760
difficult to tie back to you on
typically

534
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:22,870
this is done with an open laptop in the
passenger seat of a car

535
00:30:22,870 --> 00:30:26,330
by in the past people experimented with
war biking more jogging

536
00:30:26,330 --> 00:30:30,449
more training and others so we're
droning as I might be calm

537
00:30:30,450 --> 00:30:35,000
has some advantages over all these on
has some drone models can fly

538
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:39,270
I almost silently overhead and they can
come really down close

539
00:30:39,270 --> 00:30:42,970
or land on the roof the building's and
can loiter in place for a long time

540
00:30:42,970 --> 00:30:47,010
and then move on so is just an example
but john wants to build a really calling

541
00:30:47,010 --> 00:30:50,140
these I'm sure you get to the next hope
with the talk about it

542
00:30:50,140 --> 00:30:53,790
on so but once you got network equipment
on their

543
00:30:53,790 --> 00:30:57,180
there are all sorts of exciting things
you know it so I

544
00:30:57,180 --> 00:31:00,680
early this year The Pirate Bay put out a
press release stating that they're going

545
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:01,420
to use a fleet

546
00:31:01,420 --> 00:31:05,870
inexpensive drones and raspberry pie
computers as an aerial server farm

547
00:31:05,870 --> 00:31:11,510
I the idea is that this would require
future raids on their site to be

548
00:31:11,510 --> 00:31:12,660
conducted with

549
00:31:12,660 --> 00:31:18,000
I you know a military ground aerosol

550
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:21,300
and so you know it's hard to tell when
the pyruvate serious about that sort of

551
00:31:21,300 --> 00:31:23,860
thing but other groups have experimented
with running

552
00:31:23,860 --> 00:31:27,400
national origin file servers for drone
on and which is now it's an exciting

553
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:28,530
idea but it's scary

554
00:31:28,530 --> 00:31:31,730
cuz it sounds fine in subversive to fly
drones that are

555
00:31:31,730 --> 00:31:35,530
you know for example I seeding torrents
in all the acts an outdoor music

556
00:31:35,530 --> 00:31:37,389
festival right above the crowd

557
00:31:37,390 --> 00:31:41,210
by I remember that wired for about keep
your head down wearing a helmet

558
00:31:41,210 --> 00:31:44,220
arm anyway you can imagine

559
00:31:44,220 --> 00:31:47,870
not just file servers but mesh networks
and chat servers in all sorts of

560
00:31:47,870 --> 00:31:50,980
location-aware services that can be
deployed in the sky

561
00:31:50,980 --> 00:31:54,370
quickly on and but it's not just about
hackers

562
00:31:54,370 --> 00:31:59,130
law enforcement has some ideas for some
the user's eso in the last year to the

563
00:31:59,130 --> 00:32:01,110
FBI's been using a device which

564
00:32:01,110 --> 00:32:05,280
many of you may have heard of called a
stingray to

565
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:09,920
intercept people south on location and
now for a long time we didn't know how

566
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:14,980
often the police were actually using
these devices or any other types request

567
00:32:14,980 --> 00:32:16,390
to get information like this

568
00:32:16,390 --> 00:32:20,430
but just came out last week actually
that in the last year there was about

569
00:32:20,430 --> 00:32:23,660
one and a half million requests for
people's location data

570
00:32:23,660 --> 00:32:26,740
across the US and this number was
actually

571
00:32:26,740 --> 00:32:30,450
very well compared to what their real
number is and partly it's because if

572
00:32:30,450 --> 00:32:30,850
these

573
00:32:30,850 --> 00:32:35,390
on stingrays on so what a stingray does
is essentially

574
00:32:35,390 --> 00:32:39,250
mimic a cellphone tower on it gets a
phone to connect to it

575
00:32:39,250 --> 00:32:42,420
and it measures signals from the phone
on you know

576
00:32:42,420 --> 00:32:46,600
your cell phone springs back a signal to
cell phone towers every seven seconds

577
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:47,550
and gives

578
00:32:47,550 --> 00:32:51,070
weapons looking at a precise location
where you are

579
00:32:51,070 --> 00:32:54,760
orbits you you can see you can see where
you are on your phone

580
00:32:54,760 --> 00:32:57,900
on now these devices have various uses
but

581
00:32:57,900 --> 00:33:02,210
on they've mainly been used by police to
locate suspects

582
00:33:02,210 --> 00:33:06,690
and all this is done without a warrant a
source is actually a fake cell phone

583
00:33:06,690 --> 00:33:07,160
tower

584
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:12,420
on and so now these and stingrays can be
attached to drones

585
00:33:12,420 --> 00:33:15,960
on at last year's death can actually
drawn called up

586
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:19,690
a wasp was demoted and impersonated cell
phone towers

587
00:33:19,690 --> 00:33:24,860
used by AT&T and T Mobile to trick cell
phones into connecting to it

588
00:33:24,860 --> 00:33:30,200
rather than a carrier and it allowed the
drone to record conversations or text

589
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:31,120
messages

590
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:34,840
I and it had 32 gigabytes of storage

591
00:33:34,840 --> 00:33:38,450
so what can we all do

592
00:33:38,450 --> 00:33:42,710
about all these potential privacy
violations on visit

593
00:33:42,710 --> 00:33:46,330
could be happening fairly regularly in
the next few years when privacy law

594
00:33:46,330 --> 00:33:48,280
hasn't exactly caught up

595
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:52,030
at this technology was one way everyone
can help

596
00:33:52,030 --> 00:33:57,340
I am so although we forced the FAA to
release a list of all the agencies that

597
00:33:57,340 --> 00:33:58,770
already have drones

598
00:33:58,770 --> 00:34:02,450
unfortunately they initially refused to
say what type they are

599
00:34:02,450 --> 00:34:06,030
I or how they were going to use on so I
deff

600
00:34:06,030 --> 00:34:09,250
we partnered with a group called mock
rock a

601
00:34:09,250 --> 00:34:12,940
which is an open-government group you
can visit their website at Makro dot com

602
00:34:12,940 --> 00:34:16,079
and we filed public records requests
with

603
00:34:16,079 --> 00:34:19,810
every police agency on the list that
already has one asking what they

604
00:34:19,810 --> 00:34:21,179
intended to do

605
00:34:21,179 --> 00:34:24,270
with their drama type it was he was
gonna fly at and

606
00:34:24,270 --> 00:34:27,609
what we're you we laid out all over
concerns

607
00:34:27,609 --> 00:34:31,089
and so this only covers about two or
three dozen law enforcement agency so

608
00:34:31,089 --> 00:34:32,549
far but like I said

609
00:34:32,550 --> 00:34:37,520
I there is going to be thousands and
thousands the drones guy next few years

610
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:41,089
on and there's nineteen thousand police
agencies in the US

611
00:34:41,089 --> 00:34:44,679
arm so what you can do is you can go to
mock rock dot com and you can fill out a

612
00:34:44,679 --> 00:34:46,409
simple form yourself

613
00:34:46,409 --> 00:34:50,109
and they will file a public records
request for you you

614
00:34:50,109 --> 00:34:53,779
just enter in your local police agencies

615
00:34:53,780 --> 00:34:57,599
contact information and you can follow
along on the screen

616
00:34:57,599 --> 00:35:02,750
on as it progresses on so you can
actually help us

617
00:35:02,750 --> 00:35:06,410
map how these rounds are being used and
then we're gonna tell people

618
00:35:06,410 --> 00:35:09,960
mom once we have all this information
compiled how they can go their local

619
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:12,980
city council with our municipal
government or state government

620
00:35:12,980 --> 00:35:16,650
or congress it to try to get binding
ordinances and laws passed

621
00:35:16,650 --> 00:35:21,330
that can prevent drone surveillance
before gets outta control

622
00:35:21,330 --> 00:35:24,720
so one of the reasons that we've been
tracking drums the FF

623
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:28,590
eyes because it's on the sort obvious
privacy questions they

624
00:35:28,590 --> 00:35:31,920
now are raised by constant overhead
surveillance

625
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:35,480
but that's just the primary purpose
these machines on as everybody in this

626
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:36,590
room knows

627
00:35:36,590 --> 00:35:40,200
you can just look at the intended uses
our technology to decide where the

628
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:41,600
problems are

629
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:44,940
we have to look at the tools that are
being developed today and not just one

630
00:35:44,940 --> 00:35:49,650
not just worry about how they might
succeed but also how they might fail

631
00:35:49,650 --> 00:35:54,040
arm and the principles we push for in
responsible use of technologies

632
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:57,710
I things like you minimizing the data
collection retention

633
00:35:57,710 --> 00:36:02,390
the matter even more when we think about
how my body systems maybe

634
00:36:02,390 --> 00:36:05,730
so on that's that concludes our

635
00:36:05,730 --> 00:36:10,450
you know that the prepared party this I
but we do have time for questions now

636
00:36:10,450 --> 00:36:13,799
I want to thank everyone for listening
to his presentation

637
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:17,630
and I now afford questions and please
come up to the mic if you've got a

638
00:36:17,630 --> 00:36:18,240
question

639
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:25,240
so that it Evan Turner

640
00:36:30,319 --> 00:36:31,710
okay silly question

641
00:36:31,710 --> 00:36:35,069
for a think we are months stevensons

642
00:36:35,069 --> 00:36:38,220
owner wars I

643
00:36:38,220 --> 00:36:42,569
well so so there are a lot of these the
sci-fi concept that its you know it's

644
00:36:42,569 --> 00:36:43,279
hard to say

645
00:36:43,279 --> 00:36:46,890
30,000 in the sky and the next like
couple years arm

646
00:36:46,890 --> 00:36:50,299
and then when they've got you know

647
00:36:50,299 --> 00:36:54,269
millions yeah a and once about surrender

648
00:36:54,269 --> 00:36:58,160
will right and when we talk about you
know that you were you saw the

649
00:36:58,160 --> 00:37:01,250
the move Miskito thing that we put out
there like the like the things are

650
00:37:01,250 --> 00:37:03,339
getting smaller and smaller and cheaper
and cheaper

651
00:37:03,339 --> 00:37:07,049
and and scarier so I you know I don't
know how many years of

652
00:37:07,049 --> 00:37:11,019
we are from from trillion the ground and
is so just as a as an example there was

653
00:37:11,019 --> 00:37:11,490
a

654
00:37:11,490 --> 00:37:14,740
a video that was just released last week
about

655
00:37:14,740 --> 00:37:18,259
what's called I'm able see drone it's
basically in shape maple seed in

656
00:37:18,259 --> 00:37:21,329
just a little bit larger which
lockheed-martin makes

657
00:37:21,329 --> 00:37:25,220
and the in the during the video the

658
00:37:25,220 --> 00:37:28,970
public relations guy was just imagine it
dropping thousands and thousands as

659
00:37:28,970 --> 00:37:30,190
these out of an airplane

660
00:37:30,190 --> 00:37:35,220
so these are closer than you would think
I just wanna put in a plug for it we

661
00:37:35,220 --> 00:37:37,210
didn't have time to put in our
presentation because it was just

662
00:37:37,210 --> 00:37:37,809
announced

663
00:37:37,809 --> 00:37:41,089
I yesterday the day before but the moat
my favorite

664
00:37:41,089 --> 00:37:44,269
crazy sci-fi concept that is in practice
now

665
00:37:44,269 --> 00:37:47,849
is that Lockheed Martin has demonstrated
on charging

666
00:37:47,849 --> 00:37:51,819
their drones while there airborne be a
laser from the ground

667
00:37:51,819 --> 00:37:55,200
and allowing it to stay up indefinitely
they they didn't

668
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:58,569
a test for 48 hours but it did you know
it they kept charging it so

669
00:37:58,569 --> 00:38:01,579
I even without that is like insanity

670
00:38:01,579 --> 00:38:06,029
I'm I just want a very quickly and at
your comment but the physical access to

671
00:38:06,029 --> 00:38:08,190
drones that there seems to be a surprise
to people

672
00:38:08,190 --> 00:38:11,279
because they've been doing this for
seventy years in world war two

673
00:38:11,279 --> 00:38:14,680
Korea piloted in 10 ways ammunition on
the B-one would

674
00:38:14,680 --> 00:38:18,440
come up decided that that the wing if
you got the gyroscope past 90 degrees

675
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:20,369
with the cup was down there is no style

676
00:38:20,369 --> 00:38:24,369
the grounds Wise's surprises something
to be the person

677
00:38:24,369 --> 00:38:28,670
maze yeah its I mean with a lot of these
we we feel like rights

678
00:38:28,670 --> 00:38:31,829
it it must be so advance cuz its you
know the front line and what you're

679
00:38:31,829 --> 00:38:32,829
using on there by

680
00:38:32,829 --> 00:38:36,700
yeah there's a lot of these the sort a
simple questions that that

681
00:38:36,700 --> 00:38:42,490
we 216 packed so I'm when we went to the
flip side even as these become cheaper

682
00:38:42,490 --> 00:38:44,220
and so forth you guys you like

683
00:38:44,220 --> 00:38:47,869
legitimate uses for drones in journalism
and how do we sorta

684
00:38:47,869 --> 00:38:51,279
leverage drones in the drone wars from

685
00:38:51,279 --> 00:38:55,420
are siding cans yet it's it's not it's
not necessarily a

686
00:38:55,420 --> 00:38:59,950
completely bad thing this new technology
it's scary in the surveillance ans

687
00:38:59,950 --> 00:39:02,940
other can be used by law enforcement but
yeah of course like you mentioned there

688
00:39:02,940 --> 00:39:03,529
are

689
00:39:03,529 --> 00:39:07,140
definitely legitimate uses on journalism
being one

690
00:39:07,140 --> 00:39:10,220
another being mapping National Disaster
areas

691
00:39:10,220 --> 00:39:14,180
they can be accessed on by humans are
actually

692
00:39:14,180 --> 00:39:17,200
you know we talk about the the Stingray
and the

693
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:20,220
fake cell phone tower like me Tasha
Jones but they can also test real cell

694
00:39:20,220 --> 00:39:22,589
phone towers so in a hurricane situation

695
00:39:22,589 --> 00:39:27,299
or tornado or earthquake and cell phone
towers get destroyed drones can fly over

696
00:39:27,299 --> 00:39:30,410
and in half give people better access to
communications

697
00:39:30,410 --> 00:39:35,098
actually s SEC is RT on planning on
doing this at least

698
00:39:35,099 --> 00:39:38,799
on so you know it's definitely a
double-edge sword

699
00:39:38,799 --> 00:39:43,069
on and we're not we're not advocating
banning drones entirely

700
00:39:43,069 --> 00:39:46,680
I but that chances abuse

701
00:39:46,680 --> 00:39:50,808
four police officers if they can use
these without any sort of regulation is

702
00:39:50,809 --> 00:39:54,049
you know almost 100 percent well

703
00:39:54,049 --> 00:39:58,660
jus Carlisle is a I think the real thing
about that is without regulation

704
00:39:58,660 --> 00:40:02,160
the interesting once I was a was the
first time that the

705
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:05,808
Police Department appeared in the news
to my knowledge Association which runs

706
00:40:05,809 --> 00:40:06,380
was actually

707
00:40:06,380 --> 00:40:09,480
years ago LAPD the with the first
question

708
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:13,029
to have a military drone their specific
use was actually

709
00:40:13,029 --> 00:40:18,400
primarily as search-and-rescue ops more
the amounts is a reinforced area nearby

710
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:22,240
what you're saying they were using I
actually couldn't find people being lost

711
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:22,609
their

712
00:40:22,609 --> 00:40:25,869
this was there wasn't enough man hours
ago possible up in the air

713
00:40:25,869 --> 00:40:30,369
people go searches the the 1i drones to
help do that the supreme court shot down

714
00:40:30,369 --> 00:40:30,960
at the time

715
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:34,009
saying it was a violation privacy that
was the first

716
00:40:34,009 --> 00:40:37,009
in I nationwide connection reasons

717
00:40:37,009 --> 00:40:41,640
or good things there abs absolute limit
the quote in the robotics community is

718
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:42,339
that these are

719
00:40:42,339 --> 00:40:46,349
these are good for jobs that are too
dole dirty or dangerous

720
00:40:46,349 --> 00:40:50,210
for for humans and a and there's
certainly plenty of those tasks that

721
00:40:50,210 --> 00:40:50,829
drones

722
00:40:50,829 --> 00:40:53,829
perform better and cheaper and and so
you know

723
00:40:53,829 --> 00:40:57,690
most of the regulations that we've seen
introduced are your you need a warrant

724
00:40:57,690 --> 00:40:59,430
for this sort of thing and that

725
00:40:59,430 --> 00:41:03,169
that seems same to me yeah and you know
another great example

726
00:41:03,170 --> 00:41:07,789
reinforce fires for example on you know
drones are

727
00:41:07,789 --> 00:41:11,710
tens twenty times cheaper than flying
helicopters you know

728
00:41:11,710 --> 00:41:14,950
fly helicopters cost three thousand
dollars an hour

729
00:41:14,950 --> 00:41:18,299
John's cost fifty a hundred dollars an
hour or so on

730
00:41:18,299 --> 00:41:21,359
their art like he said they're
definitely legitimate uses

731
00:41:21,359 --> 00:41:25,150
and you know we're not advocating a
total ban by

732
00:41:25,150 --> 00:41:28,230
it's about precautions and safe
safeguards

733
00:41:28,230 --> 00:41:31,849
that was a they want that's one thing

734
00:41:31,849 --> 00:41:36,099
I came up or was that on now just a ploy
that was out for him regarding the

735
00:41:36,099 --> 00:41:39,430
on taking down the German the one thing
that I found

736
00:41:39,430 --> 00:41:43,319
managed was that I once online and

737
00:41:43,319 --> 00:41:47,239
time fines 10 that work with workers
this is Trey

738
00:41:47,239 --> 00:41:51,089
and the response was that one of the
ways that drones

739
00:41:51,089 --> 00:41:54,980
self-destruct is the way for the
electronic the

740
00:41:54,980 --> 00:41:59,309
trial electronic circuitry and sensors
and then which themselves up into a high

741
00:41:59,309 --> 00:42:03,880
high angle attack which would then prime
presumably stole the plane have a crash

742
00:42:03,880 --> 00:42:04,869
to the ground

743
00:42:04,869 --> 00:42:08,849
sale primarily email the ground would be
falling from a height

744
00:42:08,849 --> 00:42:14,539
now want things at home was interesting
ones happen the USSR and also in Russia

745
00:42:14,539 --> 00:42:18,940
arm Wayne was a in USSR was a pilot

746
00:42:18,940 --> 00:42:22,299
at lost control plane died

747
00:42:22,299 --> 00:42:26,309
arm and then ejected from the plane and

748
00:42:26,309 --> 00:42:29,619
the plane's stabilizer I think it
actually made it from Russia all with a

749
00:42:29,619 --> 00:42:30,640
Belgium

750
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:34,379
before before crashing

751
00:42:34,380 --> 00:42:37,450
before crashing in Belgium the they
can't do that

752
00:42:37,450 --> 00:42:40,519
action US had more interesting one where

753
00:42:40,519 --> 00:42:44,029
that after the pilot injected and the
plane was also

754
00:42:44,029 --> 00:42:48,559
out of control the plane's stabilized me
nearly completely 100 percent

755
00:42:48,559 --> 00:42:52,529
intact no damaged I comes in just
because

756
00:42:52,529 --> 00:42:56,710
playin the thought this was the head
there's a whole self-destructing

757
00:42:56,710 --> 00:43:00,039
by myself you know we're it would pitch
I'll

758
00:43:00,039 --> 00:43:04,099
is possible and has been proven to
happen with plain does Lindsay

759
00:43:04,099 --> 00:43:07,349
something I'm think said well the

760
00:43:07,349 --> 00:43:10,660
could be true yeah I mean that's kinda
what we're saying to we weren't

761
00:43:10,660 --> 00:43:14,819
saying for sure that they had actually I
taken it down

762
00:43:14,819 --> 00:43:18,660
via taking complete control that it's
likely that that

763
00:43:18,660 --> 00:43:21,598
or situation happen and that's where the
kinda zombie drone which part was

764
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:23,230
talking about comes into play

765
00:43:23,230 --> 00:43:26,739
they could have jammed the GPS and the
US could've lost signal with it

766
00:43:26,739 --> 00:43:29,950
and then it could have gone into this
sort of remote mode

767
00:43:29,950 --> 00:43:33,720
that on kinda tells it to land without

768
00:43:33,720 --> 00:43:36,960
actually anybody telling it to

769
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:40,529
home to what extent our law enforcement
agencies

770
00:43:40,529 --> 00:43:44,269
using this to you intercept cellular
communications

771
00:43:44,269 --> 00:43:49,750
and I do we know like what sort of data
they're looking for are they doing

772
00:43:49,750 --> 00:43:53,789
just mass gathering information and
network

773
00:43:53,789 --> 00:43:58,579
mapping or are they looking at specific
calls

774
00:43:58,579 --> 00:44:02,140
and whatever in any case lower this yeah
I mean with

775
00:44:02,140 --> 00:44:05,839
there are no confirmed cases love %uh
local police officers

776
00:44:05,839 --> 00:44:08,859
actually using drones intercept work
some magic

777
00:44:08,859 --> 00:44:11,950
so I or or federal right right on

778
00:44:11,950 --> 00:44:15,190
we know it has this capability and they
have been engaged

779
00:44:15,190 --> 00:44:19,369
like I was saying earlier on it just
came out all the cell phone companies

780
00:44:19,369 --> 00:44:23,019
least how many demands they get from law
enforcement each year and a lot of times

781
00:44:23,019 --> 00:44:26,539
like you alluded to on these demands may
be for one person

782
00:44:26,539 --> 00:44:30,170
but they come in the form of cell tower
dumps where

783
00:44:30,170 --> 00:44:33,400
the police get the location information

784
00:44:33,400 --> 00:44:36,989
%uh everybody around that cell phone
tower for a certain amount of time and

785
00:44:36,989 --> 00:44:38,989
that could be hundreds or thousands of
people

786
00:44:38,989 --> 00:44:43,059
and most a vast vast majority of them
art actual person the police

787
00:44:43,059 --> 00:44:47,390
are looking for but they still get this
information so it's it's really a

788
00:44:47,390 --> 00:44:50,989
huge privacy concern on and this just
gives them

789
00:44:50,989 --> 00:44:55,579
another weapon so to speak in their
arsenal to gather this information

790
00:44:55,579 --> 00:44:58,750
but dated to specifically answered
confirmed cases

791
00:44:58,750 --> 00:45:02,020
I we haven't seen confirmed cases and I
X I

792
00:45:02,020 --> 00:45:05,059
my personal hunch is that we probably
won't as long as it says

793
00:45:05,059 --> 00:45:08,239
easy to get the data from the from
companies as as

794
00:45:08,239 --> 00:45:11,650
this report shows I that's just the I
mean why fly the

795
00:45:11,650 --> 00:45:17,650
the robot when you just ask thank you

796
00:45:17,650 --> 00:45:22,890
I tomorrow if I wanted the DIY my own
drones are flying over Williamsburg

797
00:45:22,890 --> 00:45:23,719
Brooklyn

798
00:45:23,719 --> 00:45:26,940
can I do that is running low on breaking
is there any

799
00:45:26,940 --> 00:45:30,000
airspace regulations yet

800
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:33,450
its its line inside its I mean you it's
basically the same

801
00:45:33,450 --> 00:45:36,920
I Jordan black regulation that allowed
RC planes

802
00:45:36,920 --> 00:45:40,539
nm truthfully I'm you know we've gone to
somebody's

803
00:45:40,539 --> 00:45:43,869
these fly ins where people are fine
Eastern it looks like much you guys

804
00:45:43,869 --> 00:45:44,880
flying RC planes

805
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:48,319
like sometimes they say hey check this
out on the show and they

806
00:45:48,319 --> 00:45:51,529
you know Sat waypoints and it flies
itself around the three points

807
00:45:51,529 --> 00:45:54,910
but you from the ground just it doesn't
seem different from

808
00:45:54,910 --> 00:45:58,819
from people with the as long as its last
below 400 feet and I believe that

809
00:45:58,819 --> 00:46:01,960
can't be a popular areas he can do in
the middle the city

810
00:46:01,960 --> 00:46:05,000
up but its mike Parker said its

811
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:08,309
it's those types regulations and his
land you can do commercially that

812
00:46:08,309 --> 00:46:08,900
ceiling

813
00:46:08,900 --> 00:46:12,410
I guess in second quick question Occupy
Wall Street tracking

814
00:46:12,410 --> 00:46:16,680
his movements I had been flying drone
Bergesen website

815
00:46:16,680 --> 00:46:19,750
what would have happened you think they
would brought down

816
00:46:19,750 --> 00:46:23,230
bike its ok I did this on the cock you
capture

817
00:46:23,230 --> 00:46:26,779
and I think you might be here yeah I
-ism

818
00:46:26,779 --> 00:46:30,579
it in here is Tim here anyway

819
00:46:30,579 --> 00:46:33,640
arm so any it I

820
00:46:33,640 --> 00:46:37,219
knives there hasn't been a conflict I
don't I actually don't think that

821
00:46:37,219 --> 00:46:38,039
there'd be

822
00:46:38,039 --> 00:46:41,969
and I we can get legal advice yeah

823
00:46:41,969 --> 00:46:48,069
thank their

824
00:46:48,069 --> 00:46:51,299
winning if you could speak to the news
drones either

825
00:46:51,299 --> 00:46:54,969
armed or unarmed the nearest its own

826
00:46:54,969 --> 00:46:59,239
Mexico US yes a home in securities been

827
00:46:59,239 --> 00:47:02,980
operating these now they have 10
Predator drones I believe right now in

828
00:47:02,980 --> 00:47:05,369
the been operating for a few years they
spent

829
00:47:05,369 --> 00:47:08,869
over 250 million dollars on them

830
00:47:08,869 --> 00:47:12,500
and actually report just came out I

831
00:47:12,500 --> 00:47:15,690
feel like a month ago explaining how

832
00:47:15,690 --> 00:47:20,270
the the project is just overrun with
costs

833
00:47:20,270 --> 00:47:23,589
and how they actually haven't even been
been effective in what they're trying to

834
00:47:23,589 --> 00:47:24,660
do which is

835
00:47:24,660 --> 00:47:28,899
and stop undocumented immigrants from
coming over the border

836
00:47:28,900 --> 00:47:32,460
on I think I can't remember the exact
number but it was

837
00:47:32,460 --> 00:47:36,480
something their spending hundreds of
thousands dollars per mile per

838
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:39,859
the Akron it sound the I its some

839
00:47:39,859 --> 00:47:44,058
it's mismanaged the more than just came
out said that they you given their

840
00:47:44,059 --> 00:47:48,329
the amount I'm have drugs they have they
should be fine about 10,000 hours

841
00:47:48,329 --> 00:47:52,250
they logged about 4,000 hours of flight
time last year just because

842
00:47:52,250 --> 00:47:55,779
they've miss budget and they don't have
the people to

843
00:47:55,779 --> 00:47:58,950
to control the ground stations so it's
happening and

844
00:47:58,950 --> 00:48:02,410
and you do hear port survey by a a lot
of the

845
00:48:02,410 --> 00:48:05,549
a lot other flight time hasn't even been
for

846
00:48:05,549 --> 00:48:08,809
like strictly for Border Patrol they've
they've long and other agencies

847
00:48:08,809 --> 00:48:12,239
cells are any others other agencies more
than drug

848
00:48:12,239 --> 00:48:16,469
enforcement me against I know unpopular
drug cartels

849
00:48:16,469 --> 00:48:20,410
also actually the the I alluded to it
but in really go into specifics

850
00:48:20,410 --> 00:48:24,808
there's now a time story that on came
out two weeks ago they talked about

851
00:48:24,809 --> 00:48:27,859
how the US is flying surveillance
missions over the Caribbean

852
00:48:27,859 --> 00:48:32,509
and in these missions their their
targeting

853
00:48:32,509 --> 00:48:35,869
drug lords and its digital surveillance
they're not using

854
00:48:35,869 --> 00:48:39,700
missiles as we know it yet but yes
that's that's what they're actually

855
00:48:39,700 --> 00:48:40,430
tryna

856
00:48:40,430 --> 00:48:44,359
find we probably have time for one are
two more questions but it looks like

857
00:48:44,359 --> 00:48:45,980
they just one person in line so

858
00:48:45,980 --> 00:48:50,420
it's perfect I'll by I was a

859
00:48:50,420 --> 00:48:53,989
valve chair June 19th those at

860
00:48:53,989 --> 00:48:57,460
Department defense is a international
community control and

861
00:48:57,460 --> 00:49:01,650
research and technology symposium and
while I was there

862
00:49:01,650 --> 00:49:04,940
spy war don't remember what the acronym
stands for the Cure

863
00:49:04,940 --> 00:49:08,440
for researchers 'em government entity
but

864
00:49:08,440 --> 00:49:11,759
the gave the couple lectures about
drones and

865
00:49:11,759 --> 00:49:15,219
fully autonomous units and %uh the main
thing

866
00:49:15,219 --> 00:49:18,849
that was talk but also at the whole

867
00:49:18,849 --> 00:49:21,950
symposium was the fact that there's an
incredible information

868
00:49:21,950 --> 00:49:27,480
de Lucia going on with the government
and the military so

869
00:49:27,480 --> 00:49:31,089
the drones he say that will join us on
this inexpensive

870
00:49:31,089 --> 00:49:35,390
by is actually works expensive overall
than any other one because

871
00:49:35,390 --> 00:49:38,739
you doing with the cruel world 300-plus
people

872
00:49:38,739 --> 00:49:43,029
and most of them are in fact the
information people dealing with

873
00:49:43,029 --> 00:49:46,579
distributing and how to figure out where
this information supposed to go to so

874
00:49:46,579 --> 00:49:49,130
right now it's extremely expensive
pretty

875
00:49:49,130 --> 00:49:52,180
one information pilot right now we're
trying to think I've

876
00:49:52,180 --> 00:49:55,899
machine learning transfer through all
the decal use this information

877
00:49:55,900 --> 00:49:59,589
looked as your whatever but the also

878
00:49:59,589 --> 00:50:03,058
another thing on a bun was a so these
drones are

879
00:50:03,059 --> 00:50:06,739
haven't talked about in the magazines is
being weaponized

880
00:50:06,739 --> 00:50:11,390
where the from was ok wat copters having
teasers on a more

881
00:50:11,390 --> 00:50:15,200
dark clothes briefly mention but

882
00:50:15,200 --> 00:50:18,829
quieted down experimental drawn called
the

883
00:50:18,829 --> 00:50:22,420
eater the ATRP whatever that thing

884
00:50:22,420 --> 00:50:26,559
here in Fox News a couple world news
articles briefly a few years ago was a

885
00:50:26,559 --> 00:50:30,269
drone that good theoretically kill
people

886
00:50:30,269 --> 00:50:34,410
and live off the were shown through that
gasification

887
00:50:34,410 --> 00:50:38,049
and the fuel cells would last
theoretically up to twenty years

888
00:50:38,049 --> 00:50:39,579
according to them that still and

889
00:50:39,579 --> 00:50:42,589
parts newsreader and Huffington Post

890
00:50:42,589 --> 00:50:45,690
I'm yeah thank you for bringing that up
I those are

891
00:50:45,690 --> 00:50:49,880
I mean we hadn't seen in years in the
wild but there's word for insurance

892
00:50:49,880 --> 00:50:50,700
other stuff

893
00:50:50,700 --> 00:50:53,849
sells a thousand words where we're just
about out of time yeah

894
00:50:53,849 --> 00:50:58,190
like you mentioned at the Air Force
actually has a so much footage that

895
00:50:58,190 --> 00:51:01,140
taking the amount people they have
looking at it would take more than their

896
00:51:01,140 --> 00:51:03,469
lifetimes to actually go through at this
point

897
00:51:03,469 --> 00:51:07,049
on and you can imagine how that's going
to rise exponentially in the next few

898
00:51:07,049 --> 00:51:07,710
years

899
00:51:07,710 --> 00:51:11,769
I wish I just want to point out one more
thing if you read today's New York Times

900
00:51:11,769 --> 00:51:16,329
there's actually the FAA actually just
released less than 24 hours ago a lot

901
00:51:16,329 --> 00:51:17,880
more information

902
00:51:17,880 --> 00:51:21,890
dealing with our free nude Information
Act lawsuit

903
00:51:21,890 --> 00:51:25,279
against the FAA and they released

904
00:51:25,279 --> 00:51:28,349
18 police departments authorizations

905
00:51:28,349 --> 00:51:31,559
certificate of authorization and they
talk about what types of drones they

906
00:51:31,559 --> 00:51:32,719
