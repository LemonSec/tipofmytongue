1
00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:03,320
FM radio as lot importance to me

2
00:00:03,320 --> 00:00:07,919
this the group that's putting this talk
on the permit is radio project

3
00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:12,150
I was involved with them since the the
late 90's there was a pirate radio

4
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:14,299
station in philadelphia called radium
uni

5
00:00:14,299 --> 00:00:19,939
and the whole purpose if that was too as
a as a former social protest to

6
00:00:19,939 --> 00:00:24,550
I tell the FCC and Congress that there
should be a mechanism by which

7
00:00:24,550 --> 00:00:28,430
community should be able to have their
own low-power radio station

8
00:00:28,430 --> 00:00:32,570
on visited I'm radio is a real bonding
medium it's magical in

9
00:00:32,570 --> 00:00:36,620
powerful and there is no way to do that
without

10
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:40,540
huge amounts of money and a so

11
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:43,640
depict the Israel Project really was a
in the forefront have

12
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:47,280
making that happen through unauthorized

13
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:51,250
means and then after five visits from
the FCC the last the final one

14
00:00:51,250 --> 00:00:54,719
involving the chief of enforcement from
the FCC with an armed posse the US

15
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:55,280
Marshals

16
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:59,370
came and shut down the station but then
that may 27 stronger and we

17
00:00:59,370 --> 00:01:02,590
that started this said collapse
collective

18
00:01:02,590 --> 00:01:05,670
meet Israeli project and they've been
extremely active

19
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:08,939
in building community radio stations
around the country but more even more

20
00:01:08,939 --> 00:01:09,770
importantly

21
00:01:09,770 --> 00:01:13,979
a getting legislation through Congress
to make it possible

22
00:01:13,979 --> 00:01:17,049
to do that and there's a new opportunity
now

23
00:01:17,049 --> 00:01:21,240
to window of opportunity for people to
start radio stations and get licenses

24
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:23,759
through the FCC and he's had to develop
some really

25
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:27,060
useful tools on software and web

26
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:30,939
a web tool to facilitate that so unhappy
and reduce your

27
00:01:30,939 --> 00:01:35,540
and Martina others to for mexico she's
been involved with community radio for

28
00:01:35,540 --> 00:01:36,790
probably over a decade

29
00:01:36,790 --> 00:01:40,020
she came up here for Mexico City there
five years to work with me

30
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:43,539
yes and Maggie abner who's been involved
with community radio project

31
00:01:43,540 --> 00:01:47,579
since she was five years old and has
been working with for me he is for

32
00:01:47,579 --> 00:01:52,049
probably six or seven years and they're
very inspiring people to do in workshop

33
00:01:52,049 --> 00:01:55,710
little after the talk on you can build
your own FM radio transmitter

34
00:01:55,710 --> 00:01:59,740
downstairs so on a want to lay any more
be such a great talk

35
00:01:59,740 --> 00:02:06,740
enjoy hello good morning

36
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:15,569
on well it's pretty worth enough permit
israeli President Kevin work in

37
00:02:15,569 --> 00:02:19,470
job promoting a community radios and

38
00:02:19,470 --> 00:02:22,680
we're gonna talk a little bit about the
work that we do and permit yes

39
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:26,420
other warships in training and there
will totally with about the window they

40
00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:28,000
low power FM window

41
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:33,580
they're worth pectin on and we will then
show the tools that we developed to

42
00:02:33,580 --> 00:02:37,260
support out the cans on

43
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:42,510
so implemented as we're not just trying
to support up again sry now but we have

44
00:02:42,510 --> 00:02:45,640
about constant rain is a ten different
conference where

45
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:48,980
trying to explain people how FM work
done

46
00:02:48,980 --> 00:02:53,010
with this galaxy note 2 what we're gonna
be doing today we're going to be

47
00:02:53,010 --> 00:02:55,099
building wanna dozen small turns me
there's

48
00:02:55,099 --> 00:02:58,510
also we provide support to a

49
00:02:58,510 --> 00:03:03,480
with it existing stations and sometimes
when we went to this can a conference we

50
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:05,750
try just to show people how these

51
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:10,300
company's technology in it it's just
something that you can do and I love the

52
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:13,280
people also they have been involved
would permit is having

53
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:17,360
supporting radio stations not just in
the statesman in other countries

54
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:22,940
on and we do allow other words have
there are also two

55
00:03:22,940 --> 00:03:27,379
explain people and chill mainly in
promoting an open source a

56
00:03:27,379 --> 00:03:32,370
free software technologies in on and we
are doing and

57
00:03:32,370 --> 00:03:34,660
the training been

58
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:37,740
online too and we do also

59
00:03:37,740 --> 00:03:41,280
fundraisers where one of the most
important things to win

60
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:46,290
wanna be a group together an unlicensed
we go to the town would try to put

61
00:03:46,290 --> 00:03:47,100
together

62
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:50,520
a whole team people in downtown in from
other places

63
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:55,090
to actually be on the radio station does
one of the main things that we do and so

64
00:03:55,090 --> 00:03:56,750
far thing that will build 12

65
00:03:56,750 --> 00:04:00,080
radio stations and one out there was
full power FM

66
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:03,540
on so with these new window we respect
and a

67
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:07,769
hundreds the British stations low-power
FM radio stations are gonna be opening

68
00:04:07,770 --> 00:04:11,600
so we're kinda like preparing allow the

69
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:15,080
us just allow a team that we have to do
for psych

70
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:19,070
help the people to go through the
process is enough time to kill it's a

71
00:04:19,070 --> 00:04:23,200
little complicated than it slow with all
the FCC legislations and we have to

72
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:23,760
weigh

73
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:27,719
with still waiting for the Willows so at
the level difference that the we have to

74
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:28,169
do

75
00:04:28,169 --> 00:04:32,330
that eventually when we have rules and
then we have the window

76
00:04:32,330 --> 00:04:35,450
away respecting their love the group
that we're gonna be working the way they

77
00:04:35,450 --> 00:04:35,700
are

78
00:04:35,690 --> 00:04:41,040
mainly group there really closer working
with social justice

79
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:45,160
and with but that we're gonna have all
these eventually will be

80
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:48,330
and network a brady stations their work
in with all these

81
00:04:48,330 --> 00:04:51,659
a in the ground Alan on different

82
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:55,220
all their groups are we working their
thinkin social justice

83
00:04:55,220 --> 00:04:59,660
so

84
00:04:59,660 --> 00:05:04,220
so if okay so %uh for the process for
the

85
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:07,640
for the window in order to apply for a
radio station

86
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:10,770
when a bit is the first you need to have
is you need to find an available

87
00:05:10,770 --> 00:05:12,020
frequency

88
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:15,549
and you need to be a non-profit and then
no

89
00:05:15,550 --> 00:05:18,680
do need to have an educational mission
on

90
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:23,250
so for the first that we develop a tool
that we're gonna be explained in a

91
00:05:23,250 --> 00:05:23,860
little bit

92
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:27,260
on so it's a tool that will help
applicants

93
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:30,700
to find an available for consider town
so

94
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:34,970
do need to have a ability Pacific
location where you're gonna be placed in

95
00:05:34,970 --> 00:05:35,919
the transmitter

96
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:39,810
and from there now began 10 and then
does the area around there's going to be

97
00:05:39,810 --> 00:05:40,640
covering

98
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:43,680
are you ready station arm so

99
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:47,180
10 they the rules is also the frequency
that you have

100
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:51,280
is not counting interference with the
some other a rating system vision

101
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:54,530
on though if it does the K's

102
00:05:54,530 --> 00:05:59,000
down and the roles that with the protect
this is ready station this frequencies

103
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,910
and then you're probably gonna need to
have a in an engineering studies so they

104
00:06:02,910 --> 00:06:05,130
thought were there were gonna be present
in today

105
00:06:05,130 --> 00:06:10,340
is gonna be providing information to our
weekends whether they have to

106
00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:14,710
a to get one of these estimates and if
not then it will give you the

107
00:06:14,710 --> 00:06:15,950
information for them

108
00:06:15,950 --> 00:06:19,219
to just the take the information in to
fill the form

109
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:22,580
and to feel a bit like more paperwork
but the software

110
00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:26,200
its have the intention to make this
press is eleven more easier for people

111
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:27,360
to understand

112
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:30,930
on so

113
00:06:30,930 --> 00:06:34,169
up

114
00:06:34,169 --> 00:06:38,969
are you and know how me if you were here

115
00:06:38,970 --> 00:06:43,190
for the talk that we did about media two
years ago okay

116
00:06:43,190 --> 00:06:48,520
I'm so in the laptop we gave some
background about

117
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:52,140
I double power FM radio service on which

118
00:06:52,140 --> 00:06:57,700
on is very specific class the radio
stations and it took lasted

119
00:06:57,700 --> 00:07:02,820
moved to did too community radio in the
spy small community organization so

120
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:05,840
on starting another typeof radio station

121
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:10,060
may cost anywhere from I i 100 adding to

122
00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:13,570
a couple million dollars on 13 a
low-power FM station

123
00:07:13,570 --> 00:07:16,740
can cost about ten thousand dollars so

124
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:19,940
per mediated been fighting ever since it
came around

125
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:23,640
for more opportunities for low-power FM
stations and

126
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:26,750
in particular on after the FTC

127
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:30,669
started allowing its classic radio
station Congress passed a lot date

128
00:07:30,669 --> 00:07:32,159
really strictly limited

129
00:07:32,159 --> 00:07:36,419
on by reducing the number they local
channels so

130
00:07:36,419 --> 00:07:40,469
previous an Ubuntu our allies Spain a
good ten years

131
00:07:40,470 --> 00:07:43,599
trying to convince congress to reverse
this law

132
00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:46,650
on and when we left off at

133
00:07:46,650 --> 00:07:49,770
that media talk two years ago this lie
ahead

134
00:07:49,770 --> 00:07:53,760
passed through the house in congress and
it was stuck in the senate and

135
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:57,190
that would July and it stayed

136
00:07:57,190 --> 00:08:01,570
stock for up through the fall and
finally things started moving in

137
00:08:01,570 --> 00:08:02,310
December

138
00:08:02,310 --> 00:08:06,190
and we seem to have lost the slide here
but wanted the culminating event

139
00:08:06,190 --> 00:08:09,190
was on and flash mob

140
00:08:09,190 --> 00:08:12,219
circuit that we held in Washington DC

141
00:08:12,219 --> 00:08:16,440
so what are the biggest opponent the
what we call the local Community Radio

142
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:17,039
Act

143
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:20,649
wait the National Association of
Broadcasters which represents a lot of

144
00:08:20,649 --> 00:08:21,940
the big broadcasters

145
00:08:21,940 --> 00:08:27,070
on day as it turned out 10+2 not want
small community radio stations

146
00:08:27,070 --> 00:08:32,140
on and they were doing everything that
they could it to keep

147
00:08:32,140 --> 00:08:36,779
I this bill from passing and two we had
been using the slogan stop using making

148
00:08:36,779 --> 00:08:38,838
community radio jump through hoops

149
00:08:38,839 --> 00:08:42,510
so we had maybe 30 people

150
00:08:42,510 --> 00:08:46,240
show up at the National Association of
Broadcasters headquarters with hula

151
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:46,899
hoops

152
00:08:46,899 --> 00:08:50,820
on and had a big hula hoop festival and
within days

153
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:54,690
the lot head it passed through the
senate I'm in January

154
00:08:54,690 --> 00:08:58,080
it got signed by the president and now
it's a lot

155
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:04,980
though that way

156
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:09,000
that's why we're where we are now and
we've been able to shift from

157
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:13,490
spending most of our time on basically
fighting with congress to spend the most

158
00:09:13,490 --> 00:09:14,649
part time primary

159
00:09:14,649 --> 00:09:21,649
preparing community groups to apply for
radio life-and-death

160
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:26,540
I'm gonna pass around also a something
up she's if people want to get their

161
00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:28,319
information

162
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:32,700
another is not gonna be a love available
channels may be in no here in New York

163
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:34,050
because it's already

164
00:09:34,050 --> 00:09:37,430
dial is really crowded a but

165
00:09:37,430 --> 00:09:41,470
if you know them weigh them might need
information or something

166
00:09:41,470 --> 00:09:45,670
places for information and

167
00:09:45,670 --> 00:09:49,209
on so we have a lot of people with

168
00:09:49,209 --> 00:09:53,180
everyday if calling out and ask you know
what's going on

169
00:09:53,180 --> 00:09:57,180
what the cabin and like I say no burning
them information Anna

170
00:09:57,180 --> 00:10:00,290
are the the application and we're still
like 0

171
00:10:00,290 --> 00:10:04,660
well with filler have growth and non
we're expecting growth

172
00:10:04,660 --> 00:10:10,610
a last year and we respect in the rooms
were gonna come this early spring

173
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:13,899
and they keep pushing and pushing it
back and now

174
00:10:13,899 --> 00:10:16,680
it's a little frustrating because
there's a lot of people and we have been

175
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:20,070
doing a lot about rich work to let
people know that

176
00:10:20,070 --> 00:10:24,540
opportunity is gonna be here but still
be frustrating having to tell people

177
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:28,110
hold on you know it gonna happen is
going to happen we're gonna have a radio

178
00:10:28,110 --> 00:10:29,010
stations

179
00:10:29,010 --> 00:10:32,819
I bed it is also given at the time to be
all the more prepare

180
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:37,620
and now we are developing tools a there
will also lead with

181
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:42,330
provide more support and advice for epic
and because we're like maybe

182
00:10:42,330 --> 00:10:46,080
7 people work in a promiscuous and

183
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:49,380
a lot about some other do in word is
more arm

184
00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:53,800
really they would policy in other like
more technique are in other peoples and

185
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:55,060
how this

186
00:10:55,060 --> 00:10:59,209
so we're just trying to think in a way
that we can provide more support and so

187
00:10:59,209 --> 00:11:02,339
we develop a tool does a it's a website

188
00:11:02,339 --> 00:11:07,080
Isaac already a spark and the intention
is to have a thumb can about

189
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:12,130
social network there can have a they
have also form so people can go there

190
00:11:12,130 --> 00:11:13,800
and post questions

191
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:18,290
and they can also be in I'm makin
connections with other applicants

192
00:11:18,290 --> 00:11:23,189
ano its it's just the way for like a
social nowhere but other than Facebook

193
00:11:23,190 --> 00:11:24,620
and other than

194
00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:28,690
progress because really cry brother was
in really gonna work for art

195
00:11:28,690 --> 00:11:32,660
I'll so with the belgrade espresso I'm
just gonna show

196
00:11:32,660 --> 00:11:38,620
relief have a read this part is just
basically a form to support as we can

197
00:11:38,620 --> 00:11:43,740
thinking a good

198
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:46,760
okay so

199
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:50,490
basically just have to go there and this
is not just for applicants is also for

200
00:11:50,490 --> 00:11:52,130
people there already have

201
00:11:52,130 --> 00:11:56,160
ready if they just and also for all the
people there engineers the people that

202
00:11:56,160 --> 00:12:00,370
can provide also support so this is
basically an invitation for all you

203
00:12:00,370 --> 00:12:03,700
if you think that you can help us
support after getting one

204
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:06,760
wanna other way when we can be you know
like

205
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:10,000
oh I have this equipment they are youths
and you know it's probably a mix

206
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,490
Terrence probably something this

207
00:12:11,490 --> 00:12:15,250
some public and that some ready station
in the future is gonna need

208
00:12:15,250 --> 00:12:18,690
so if you have resources are the only
thing that you have to do is create an

209
00:12:18,690 --> 00:12:19,670
account

210
00:12:19,670 --> 00:12:22,689
and then I you can go or the

211
00:12:22,690 --> 00:12:26,410
to resources and you can say like oh I
live in this town

212
00:12:26,410 --> 00:12:29,069
i'll know I know this person

213
00:12:29,070 --> 00:12:31,910
they have the thick women and you know
they probably have an antenna or

214
00:12:31,910 --> 00:12:32,969
something they can

215
00:12:32,970 --> 00:12:37,020
they can be useful for sale that some
other people and you can just go there

216
00:12:37,020 --> 00:12:41,210
you know and just pose you know I'm
disperse on and I have these resources

217
00:12:41,210 --> 00:12:43,320
and I will be super super helpful
because

218
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:47,200
their thirdly there's like hundreds of
people there trying to get ready

219
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:50,070
stations and one of the main problems
they have

220
00:12:50,070 --> 00:12:53,870
all with money so money and also

221
00:12:53,870 --> 00:12:57,690
on if you know engineers also we're
trying to recruit more engineer they

222
00:12:57,690 --> 00:13:00,430
have experienced enough going up
occasions

223
00:13:00,430 --> 00:13:03,840
for at the famo for

224
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:06,940
for radio fm on and

225
00:13:06,940 --> 00:13:10,920
that's another thing that is really
important because engineering studies

226
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:12,380
card from

227
00:13:12,380 --> 00:13:16,200
by 100 up to 2,000 dependent and how
complex it

228
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:20,170
that I so we're trying to find people
that is willing to

229
00:13:20,170 --> 00:13:24,060
you know like maybe de locos study or
something

230
00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:27,190
or people have the expertise for these
pictures

231
00:13:27,190 --> 00:13:31,250
we respect thing that's going to be at
some point housing people applying

232
00:13:31,250 --> 00:13:35,980
and did feel a bit tricky when you're
talking about engineering studies kiss

233
00:13:35,980 --> 00:13:39,370
when engineer cannot be percent in
waiver

234
00:13:39,370 --> 00:13:43,580
representing another group the we have
unlimited people may be a little like 25

235
00:13:43,580 --> 00:13:45,140
engineers they have experienced

236
00:13:45,140 --> 00:13:49,180
doing this can I started I sorry just
trying to recruit more people

237
00:13:49,180 --> 00:13:52,750
so read this park is this going to or
you can go and

238
00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:56,850
help other people they want us to reduce
stations if you are a person they want

239
00:13:56,850 --> 00:13:59,640
us to rate this creation I read
efficient you can just

240
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:03,350
going create a profile and tablet can
and then

241
00:14:03,350 --> 00:14:06,570
other people will be able to see your
profile

242
00:14:06,570 --> 00:14:10,550
in if you have any questions you can go
to the forum

243
00:14:10,550 --> 00:14:13,090
and joke in there can I share

244
00:14:13,090 --> 00:14:16,900
announce where questions I am and now

245
00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:21,600
another tool that we're gonna be showing
is are free are free is the tool

246
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:26,210
to fine and available channel to see it
was unavailable to know in your

247
00:14:26,210 --> 00:14:26,940
community

248
00:14:26,940 --> 00:14:30,580
and we have a community here also

249
00:14:30,580 --> 00:14:37,350
where we have a discussions and you can
go there and you can just crave the team

250
00:14:37,350 --> 00:14:41,450
and then that's where we're providing
the supporter for

251
00:14:41,450 --> 00:14:45,090
are free um so we're just trying to

252
00:14:45,090 --> 00:14:49,300
Bush out against two years the ith tool
and if they love

253
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:53,290
also a people in the office trying to
answer all these questions

254
00:14:53,290 --> 00:14:56,439
a where pretended just trying to be

255
00:14:56,440 --> 00:15:00,860
pedestal there so that way you know it
it's not just of providing support but

256
00:15:00,860 --> 00:15:02,140
it's the whole community

257
00:15:02,140 --> 00:15:05,620
a people have been working doing
independent media for a long time they

258
00:15:05,620 --> 00:15:07,380
can offer their expertise here

259
00:15:07,380 --> 00:15:11,620
on so it

260
00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:17,550
they have the look the friend I'll
resources and you can explore but I'm

261
00:15:17,550 --> 00:15:18,460
not gonna go on

262
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:23,130
show all these right now because we want
to use 11 more time to show the tool

263
00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:26,220
there may have been a percentage you
have been working in the store

264
00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:31,710
I so an

265
00:15:31,710 --> 00:15:36,240
on-air talk a little bit about the
motivation for this other tool we have

266
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:37,270
which is called

267
00:15:37,270 --> 00:15:41,120
are free on so

268
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:44,900
if you'd never look at the FCC rules for

269
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:48,440
allocating radio stations on he should
probably be grateful

270
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:52,020
it turns out this is a really
complicated problems though

271
00:15:52,020 --> 00:15:55,760
on aside from the bureaucratic part of
this problem

272
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:59,460
you're trying to figure out how to pitch
at many stations on the air as possible

273
00:15:59,460 --> 00:16:01,470
without having them interfere with each
other

274
00:16:01,470 --> 00:16:04,850
so you need to know their latitude and
longitude

275
00:16:04,850 --> 00:16:08,810
on and their elevation because that
impacts how far the signal goes

276
00:16:08,810 --> 00:16:12,310
on you also need to know what channel
there I'm

277
00:16:12,310 --> 00:16:17,710
and on good databases other stations is
constantly changing

278
00:16:17,710 --> 00:16:20,880
so really you have latitude/longitude hi

279
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:24,390
frequency and time so it's like at five
dimensional problem that you're trying

280
00:16:24,390 --> 00:16:25,280
to optimize

281
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:29,339
on and then you throw and bureaucracy on
top of that and it at

282
00:16:29,340 --> 00:16:32,750
little bit of a math so the rules for

283
00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:35,970
on low-power FM stations have

284
00:16:35,970 --> 00:16:39,190
well they will hopefully soon have

285
00:16:39,190 --> 00:16:42,610
on basically to tears and the first here

286
00:16:42,610 --> 00:16:48,200
is the rules about on just how far away
you can be from another station

287
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:51,650
so if you are a look at our station

288
00:16:51,650 --> 00:16:55,430
on one channel and there's on

289
00:16:55,430 --> 00:16:59,250
let's say a full power station two
channels over

290
00:16:59,250 --> 00:17:03,150
there will be a particular distance that
you have to keep from that station

291
00:17:03,150 --> 00:17:06,180
that depends on I'm on

292
00:17:06,180 --> 00:17:09,880
what part of the country the Tuesday
schindler an what class

293
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:13,600
the other station is so there's like
last a Class B Class D

294
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:16,839
stations I'm how long they've been on

295
00:17:16,839 --> 00:17:20,089
air in some cases the them all their
stations are grandfathered

296
00:17:20,089 --> 00:17:26,159
I am and a couple and other things and
the rules are different for

297
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:29,160
with cokie to Jason C so on

298
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:33,440
there's one said Oh distances for
someone who's on the same channel issued

299
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:35,860
is another set for the first the JC
channel

300
00:17:35,860 --> 00:17:39,110
just one channel over and another step
for the second adjacent channel

301
00:17:39,110 --> 00:17:42,780
on so if you be all those rose you're
good

302
00:17:42,780 --> 00:17:46,330
on if you don't meet those rules on

303
00:17:46,330 --> 00:17:49,600
your channel or first adjacent channel
on

304
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:53,270
you're pretty much out of luck so there
might be something else on a different

305
00:17:53,270 --> 00:17:55,139
channel or in a nearby area

306
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:58,750
on but you cannot apply for that channel
in that location

307
00:17:58,750 --> 00:18:02,920
on there's also a big gray area at which
is if you're

308
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:06,350
only sure the distance is that are
required on

309
00:18:06,350 --> 00:18:09,750
I'm second adjacent channel so in that
case

310
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:14,230
there's some room for the FCC to make
waivers and you might be able to get a

311
00:18:14,230 --> 00:18:17,600
waiver if you can show that you won't
actually interfere with the station is

312
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:18,320
close by

313
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:21,720
and you can show that primarily based on
terrain

314
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:25,560
and also based on the actual power that
somebody is operating not

315
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:30,300
on so you may have make a class the
station it's not actually

316
00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:34,240
are classy station did not actually
using the maximum power for class T

317
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:37,670
so when you just consider the class that
looks like you're too close

318
00:18:37,670 --> 00:18:40,820
but when you consider their actual power
you're not too close

319
00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:44,439
so the old way a Cecchin

320
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:49,340
all these rules with to do by hand do
you get a big with the radio stations

321
00:18:49,340 --> 00:18:52,770
you'd find all the stations nearby you
take a map and you would take a ruler

322
00:18:52,770 --> 00:18:53,430
and measure

323
00:18:53,430 --> 00:18:56,890
and thankfully we have computers now tho

324
00:18:56,890 --> 00:19:00,010
you don't have to do that on but the

325
00:19:00,010 --> 00:19:03,640
available software options for doing
this are pretty limited

326
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:08,490
so there are some commercial options and
knows work reasonably well

327
00:19:08,490 --> 00:19:11,940
on if you're an engineer and you have to
experience with them

328
00:19:11,940 --> 00:19:15,390
but they're also really expected on
their

329
00:19:15,390 --> 00:19:19,340
generally on the order a ten thousand
dollars which is a doubt what most low

330
00:19:19,340 --> 00:19:22,060
power station span just to get on the
air

331
00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:25,280
on for everything altogether like all of
their equipment

332
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:28,930
and up space on

333
00:19:28,930 --> 00:19:32,950
there are also some free tools but the
free tools are pretty limited in what

334
00:19:32,950 --> 00:19:33,970
they can do

335
00:19:33,970 --> 00:19:38,590
so the FEC has a channel search tool and
there's an organization called

336
00:19:38,590 --> 00:19:41,929
re: see networks they also has a channel
search

337
00:19:41,930 --> 00:19:44,990
on but they only do the

338
00:19:44,990 --> 00:19:49,190
first path so the check the defense is
it but they won't check the terrain for

339
00:19:49,190 --> 00:19:50,250
you

340
00:19:50,250 --> 00:19:55,220
so I'm our goal when we created our free

341
00:19:55,220 --> 00:19:58,610
was basically to make something better
so

342
00:19:58,610 --> 00:20:02,790
we wanted it all they could do the
distance stuff and the terrain stuff

343
00:20:02,790 --> 00:20:06,420
and we wanted to have multiple versions
so

344
00:20:06,420 --> 00:20:10,240
they're worth on a basic version bit
dumb

345
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:13,180
group that's trying to apply and doesn't
have a lot of engineering experience

346
00:20:13,180 --> 00:20:14,590
could use

347
00:20:14,590 --> 00:20:17,610
and the basic version can even see up
here

348
00:20:17,610 --> 00:20:20,630
head a lot of helpful stuff like tech

349
00:20:20,630 --> 00:20:24,410
telling you what to do I'm and it only
gives you like the minimum level and

350
00:20:24,410 --> 00:20:26,340
information that you need

351
00:20:26,340 --> 00:20:30,490
so if you fall into that what we call
the green category

352
00:20:30,490 --> 00:20:34,410
where on you me all at the distance
rules

353
00:20:34,410 --> 00:20:38,100
then this software will eventually

354
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:41,360
give you everything that you need it to
get to the point where you're ready to

355
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:44,140
apply it to work but walk you through

356
00:20:44,140 --> 00:20:47,470
figuring out exactly what location to
put on your application

357
00:20:47,470 --> 00:20:50,770
what to fill out in different fields on
if you're

358
00:20:50,770 --> 00:20:53,950
in the yellow category which is

359
00:20:53,950 --> 00:20:57,810
the category for if you might be able to
get a waiver

360
00:20:57,810 --> 00:21:01,530
on it gets you to the point where you
have all the information

361
00:21:01,530 --> 00:21:05,330
that you would need to give to an
engineer on so that they can take you

362
00:21:05,330 --> 00:21:06,879
for and from there

363
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:11,180
on if you're in the red category where
there's nothing available for you

364
00:21:11,180 --> 00:21:14,980
on it will either help you look for
other stuff nearby

365
00:21:14,980 --> 00:21:18,060
or give you think gestion about on

366
00:21:18,060 --> 00:21:21,080
alternatives to FM radio tho maybe

367
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:23,760
you're just not going to be able to do
it but you could get some good

368
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:25,500
information about

369
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:28,840
II web streaming our podcast in

370
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:33,010
on on top of that we're also working on
an engineer version

371
00:21:33,010 --> 00:21:36,040
and the goal would be engineered version
is had

372
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:39,149
everything an engineer would need to
write a waiver for you

373
00:21:39,150 --> 00:21:42,180
on and automate the process so

374
00:21:42,180 --> 00:21:45,800
with the older software on you can

375
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:49,500
figure out all the things you need it
for an application but you have to do a

376
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:51,320
lot of the groundwork yourself

377
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:54,929
so we want to have something where you
put in the basic info and its bit adding

378
00:21:54,930 --> 00:21:58,770
did it for an application on

379
00:21:58,770 --> 00:22:02,920
another goal that we had was to have
this all be free and open source

380
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:08,160
so on the reason that we exist is to
help people

381
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:12,040
basically take control of their own
media and radios

382
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:16,850
kinda complicated thing to start with on
it's not as bad as it sometimes look but

383
00:22:16,850 --> 00:22:18,730
it takes people a while to get to hang a
bit

384
00:22:18,730 --> 00:22:22,560
and it's really important to us did
somebody feels like they understand the

385
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:26,379
technology that they're using well
enough that they can own that technology

386
00:22:26,380 --> 00:22:29,430
and not have to rely on somebody else

387
00:22:29,430 --> 00:22:34,740
on so if you need to make a lot of sense
to also have

388
00:22:34,740 --> 00:22:39,220
tools to use along the way but you can
have some control over

389
00:22:39,220 --> 00:22:42,290
so telling allo people who we were set

390
00:22:42,290 --> 00:22:45,320
on going to start their own radio
station they

391
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:49,000
they should use a expensive proprietary
tool

392
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:52,120
just wasn't really making sense so

393
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:55,130
I what we ended up with was

394
00:22:55,130 --> 00:22:58,429
I'm something did a web-based tool

395
00:22:58,429 --> 00:23:01,610
on it's based on CakePHP

396
00:23:01,610 --> 00:23:05,400
which is a web application framework
kinda like Ruby on Rails

397
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:09,910
on it also has from fort ransom see them
C-plus class

398
00:23:09,910 --> 00:23:12,950
for MySQL on at the things happen

399
00:23:12,950 --> 00:23:16,740
so it draws on code from a lot of
different sources it take them to the

400
00:23:16,740 --> 00:23:18,260
FTC's code

401
00:23:18,260 --> 00:23:21,960
on it take inspiration from rete
networks

402
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:26,679
on it also has some code from an
engineer named Al Davis in new york he's

403
00:23:26,679 --> 00:23:28,990
been working on it for a while himself

404
00:23:28,990 --> 00:23:32,230
on and there a couple

405
00:23:32,230 --> 00:23:36,169
advantages of having it be a web-based
tools that means that we can share login

406
00:23:36,169 --> 00:23:38,230
information with radius Park

407
00:23:38,230 --> 00:23:41,240
the other tool that you just saw so on

408
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:46,419
somebody can I talk to another person
and say hey I did a search go look at my

409
00:23:46,419 --> 00:23:49,679
searching the other person can log in
the radius parking fee there

410
00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:53,480
our Free Church is it a time sort have
I'm

411
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:56,810
it also means we can have a shared
database so that when the FTC update

412
00:23:56,810 --> 00:23:59,770
their data every couple of days we don't
have to tell

413
00:23:59,770 --> 00:24:03,770
a hundred users to outdo their own
database updates

414
00:24:03,770 --> 00:24:08,100
and the basic version is in a beta
release right now

415
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:12,460
so we do have people using it number
still working out some bugs

416
00:24:12,460 --> 00:24:17,090
and the engineering version is are still
in the works

417
00:24:17,090 --> 00:24:24,090
so I'm gonna give a little bit a bag
guided tour through our free

418
00:24:25,310 --> 00:24:29,918
the login page they had some warning

419
00:24:29,919 --> 00:24:33,010
and if you are already logged into
radius Park

420
00:24:33,010 --> 00:24:40,010
it should log UN automatically

421
00:24:40,169 --> 00:24:46,940
mom

422
00:24:46,940 --> 00:24:52,330
okay call so this is ok with them the
search is this ana has already done

423
00:24:52,330 --> 00:24:56,970
so when you do a search for a frequency
and location it get stage and you can

424
00:24:56,970 --> 00:24:58,150
come back to it later

425
00:24:58,150 --> 00:25:01,460
a I'm gonna do a new location right now

426
00:25:01,460 --> 00:25:06,200
I this is what you would see originally
it was your first login

427
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:09,700
so I wanted to try

428
00:25:09,700 --> 00:25:13,550
a channel search right here in New York
City I'm

429
00:25:13,550 --> 00:25:17,000
it turns out the search is really slow
when you do it in a place that had this

430
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,940
many Tanner this many cases on the air
already

431
00:25:19,940 --> 00:25:23,190
at so I'm gonna do one in philadelphia
is dead

432
00:25:23,190 --> 00:25:26,490
it go a little slow but it's not so bad
an

433
00:25:26,490 --> 00:25:29,650
who the ed Ruth

434
00:25:29,650 --> 00:25:34,210
I'm putting a is the church that permit
the issues to have our offices in

435
00:25:34,210 --> 00:25:37,530
it's one of the tallest buildings in the
neighborhood so it actually pretty good

436
00:25:37,530 --> 00:25:38,280
place

437
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:44,680
for a radio our an for some reason a
Google

438
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:48,030
maps sometimes takes you to Arizona when
you do your first search

439
00:25:48,030 --> 00:25:52,850
at we don't have any control over their
on

440
00:25:52,850 --> 00:25:57,120
yeah I think that'll help

441
00:25:57,120 --> 00:26:00,160
it does sometimes take you to the wrong
place

442
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:04,470
even a few on do put in all the right
into

443
00:26:04,470 --> 00:26:07,860
this looks good though the Philadelphia

444
00:26:07,860 --> 00:26:11,540
on the blue circle here is a really
rough

445
00:26:11,540 --> 00:26:14,830
estimate of the coverage you would get
from a low power station

446
00:26:14,830 --> 00:26:19,139
on at that location and it will get a
more refined estimate and

447
00:26:19,140 --> 00:26:22,250
so I'm gonna call this church

448
00:26:22,250 --> 00:26:29,250
because that's what at that address and

449
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:33,420
now we get to wait a minute well we're
waiting all mention

450
00:26:33,420 --> 00:26:38,260
date you're all invited to come to the
transmitter building workshop at noon it

451
00:26:38,260 --> 00:26:39,850
in the hackerspace village

452
00:26:39,850 --> 00:26:44,500
I'm and I'm told that the keynote from
the Yes Men will be streamed down stairs

453
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:45,820
they can come build transmitters

454
00:26:45,820 --> 00:26:49,800
and let me tell you yes man you don't
have to choose between I

455
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:53,340
bid to what we call the easy cable it
that cable love

456
00:26:53,340 --> 00:26:56,610
available frequencies at this location
on

457
00:26:56,610 --> 00:26:59,620
and they're broken down by the
categories I was talking about green

458
00:26:59,620 --> 00:27:00,510
yellow and red

459
00:27:00,510 --> 00:27:04,550
and fortunately there are no green
channels at this location

460
00:27:04,550 --> 00:27:09,230
because there's a lot of stuff on the
air in philadelphia there is one yellow

461
00:27:09,230 --> 00:27:09,810
channel

462
00:27:09,810 --> 00:27:13,480
that means there'll probably be a lot of
competition for this channel

463
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:16,590
on I wanna look at what I think is

464
00:27:16,590 --> 00:27:19,700
actually more interesting which is the
red channels

465
00:27:19,700 --> 00:27:25,090
so on the with the red channels are
channels it

466
00:27:25,090 --> 00:27:28,560
are not available at this location so
they have some shorts basing that

467
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:30,129
there's no way to get around

468
00:27:30,130 --> 00:27:34,460
as far as we know on but there's a
possibility that there's something

469
00:27:34,460 --> 00:27:35,140
nearby

470
00:27:35,140 --> 00:27:40,570
based on the numbers that we see in the
database so and I could burn wannabes

471
00:27:40,570 --> 00:27:44,780
I get a little map Anna the color in it
a little funny there

472
00:27:44,780 --> 00:27:48,480
but this is an availability map so I'm

473
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:52,340
it has red circled in yellow saree both
lift up here is red

474
00:27:52,340 --> 00:27:55,840
if that is yellow is hard to tell right
now on

475
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:58,910
fairly easy to tell if I switch off the
red that's what I get

476
00:27:58,910 --> 00:28:02,190
effects which of the yellow I get that

477
00:28:02,190 --> 00:28:06,180
on I can also check this box that says

478
00:28:06,180 --> 00:28:12,080
I at 10:30 David I'm

479
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:15,740
and EDL

480
00:28:15,740 --> 00:28:20,770
show you the difference between
availability now and before this law

481
00:28:20,770 --> 00:28:21,530
passed

482
00:28:21,530 --> 00:28:26,230
on so I don't think there's any
difference here in this case in a lot of

483
00:28:26,230 --> 00:28:27,960
places it makes a huge difference

484
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:33,740
so if I could move my patient somewhere
in that area that yellow but not read

485
00:28:33,740 --> 00:28:36,870
then this channel in theory would turn
into a yelling town

486
00:28:36,870 --> 00:28:40,110
so but this is kinda cool because

487
00:28:40,110 --> 00:28:43,900
I some other area the thin yellow is
actually more populated than the place

488
00:28:43,900 --> 00:28:44,900
where I started off

489
00:28:44,900 --> 00:28:48,430
his a more populated part of Philly

490
00:28:48,430 --> 00:28:52,730
so I'm gonna try saving at my new
location and sometimes it works and

491
00:28:52,730 --> 00:28:54,430
sometimes it doesn't sell

492
00:28:54,430 --> 00:29:01,430
keep fingers crossed

493
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:07,240
and see a couple love

494
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:14,240
other things to New on the

495
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:18,900
map that you see here is only valid
within 20 kilometers surveys in doubt

496
00:29:18,900 --> 00:29:21,460
you would see a bunch of stuff that
looks really great like it with all

497
00:29:21,460 --> 00:29:22,160
available

498
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:25,430
that's because we're on the check in
staff within 20 kilometers

499
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:30,970
I'm I'll talk about the height stuff
while this is going so

500
00:29:30,970 --> 00:29:34,950
um the f50 want some information about

501
00:29:34,950 --> 00:29:39,060
elevation on your application it turns
out they don't really care about how

502
00:29:39,060 --> 00:29:39,899
high you are

503
00:29:39,900 --> 00:29:43,400
in make a relative to mean sea level ven

504
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:47,280
what they care about is how high you are
relative to the stuff around you

505
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:50,990
so be using metric called height above
average terrain

506
00:29:50,990 --> 00:29:54,740
and on this is kind of a tough com

507
00:29:54,740 --> 00:29:58,000
I calculation so to get your head above
average terrain

508
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:02,150
you look at a different radios going in

509
00:30:02,150 --> 00:30:05,670
at fifteen kilometers I think away from
your location

510
00:30:05,670 --> 00:30:09,120
and you take like 40 data points on each
at those

511
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:12,720
radios any average them all and you get
an average train hi

512
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:17,100
on and then you compare that to your
height and see how far you are above

513
00:30:17,100 --> 00:30:18,190
average terrain

514
00:30:18,190 --> 00:30:24,170
so for low-power FM on you can be up to
30 meters above average train

515
00:30:24,170 --> 00:30:27,410
if your higher than that you have to
turn your power down and if you're lower

516
00:30:27,410 --> 00:30:29,780
than that you don't get any bonus power
so

517
00:30:29,780 --> 00:30:33,260
for a lot of people the goal is to be
exactly 30 meters

518
00:30:33,260 --> 00:30:37,370
on and usually that calculated you seen

519
00:30:37,370 --> 00:30:41,260
a terrain database um we don't have a
terrain database

520
00:30:41,260 --> 00:30:46,430
their thumb the you can get for free but
the one that the FCC uses isn't publicly

521
00:30:46,430 --> 00:30:49,970
available and we wanted our calculations
to match the FTC's

522
00:30:49,970 --> 00:30:53,990
so that if somebody I had figured out
their high in our free and put it on

523
00:30:53,990 --> 00:30:56,310
their application the FCC does it say

524
00:30:56,310 --> 00:31:00,899
wait that's wrong so on the FTP doesn't
have this

525
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:04,600
online I height above average terrain
calculator

526
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:07,960
and the you can do

527
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:11,900
both queries on are you can skip the
book we read through this calculator

528
00:31:11,900 --> 00:31:15,990
so the way that we check someone tight
above-average train

529
00:31:15,990 --> 00:31:20,110
on is just to take their location and
send that to the SEC 32 row

530
00:31:20,110 --> 00:31:23,180
on the thing we realized it was really
exciting

531
00:31:23,180 --> 00:31:26,770
would be if we did enough cleary that
enough points in the US

532
00:31:26,770 --> 00:31:30,379
we could actually back at their training
database we haven't done that yet but

533
00:31:30,380 --> 00:31:32,030
it's fun to know that we could

534
00:31:32,030 --> 00:31:37,899
an so I'm gonna skip the movie my
location thing but I promise

535
00:31:37,900 --> 00:31:41,000
when actually works it does the right
thing on

536
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:48,000
and maybe 0

537
00:31:48,350 --> 00:31:52,280
it only shows the channels they had any
them little chance

538
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:56,870
so I'm all the stuff it with it as read

539
00:31:56,870 --> 00:32:01,370
is because according to the numbers in
the database there's a chance that you

540
00:32:01,370 --> 00:32:02,810
can get something close by

541
00:32:02,810 --> 00:32:08,200
basically that means that one-fifth 4.4
kilometers that means your

542
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:12,080
a short space by at most four point four
kilometers

543
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:16,510
so he moved 4.4 kilometers away you'll
get away from the station you were

544
00:32:16,510 --> 00:32:20,670
overlapping with but there's a chance to
overlap with someone else so it

545
00:32:20,670 --> 00:32:24,850
there's no possibility of anything
within thirteen kilometers

546
00:32:24,850 --> 00:32:29,380
on which is about I double the distance
day

547
00:32:29,380 --> 00:32:33,450
your station on signal would go

548
00:32:33,450 --> 00:32:40,390
then we don't put it on yeah

549
00:32:40,390 --> 00:32:43,880
arm the directional antenna thing is
something new

550
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:49,230
the right D a fiftieth talked about it
not clear whether they'll allow it

551
00:32:49,230 --> 00:32:53,860
the problem is did right to the problem
is the

552
00:32:53,860 --> 00:32:57,720
the main thing that the problem in the
overlap isn't your contour

553
00:32:57,720 --> 00:33:01,330
it's the other stations contour so on

554
00:33:01,330 --> 00:33:06,370
you might have 50 kilometers overlap you
could it turn off your station

555
00:33:06,370 --> 00:33:09,940
on and basically like eliminate all over
your coverage

556
00:33:09,940 --> 00:33:14,200
and you would still have like 45
kilometers have overlap but I

557
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:18,340
on I love that overlap is coming from
the full power station signal which is a

558
00:33:18,340 --> 00:33:19,510
lot bigger than yours

559
00:33:19,510 --> 00:33:24,470
so cutting down on on your coverage in a
particular direction only help thing

560
00:33:24,470 --> 00:33:25,400
really

561
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:29,630
specific situations right I'm

562
00:33:29,630 --> 00:33:33,030
so the other thing to look at here is
this map up here

563
00:33:33,030 --> 00:33:37,700
on and I think we can see a bigger
version later

564
00:33:37,700 --> 00:33:41,620
but this map here actually does account
for train through the first map you

565
00:33:41,620 --> 00:33:42,990
start with a blue circle

566
00:33:42,990 --> 00:33:46,460
was just on circular this one

567
00:33:46,460 --> 00:33:50,420
had things like I'll wider contour

568
00:33:50,420 --> 00:33:53,950
in the northwest there because the train
is a little bit lower in your signal

569
00:33:53,950 --> 00:33:56,480
would probably get further

570
00:33:56,480 --> 00:34:02,330
mmm third is it place to verify your
latitude and longitude

571
00:34:02,330 --> 00:34:05,600
I there's an elevation and hate
calculator on

572
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:09,380
and that's where the title but average
trains def come then

573
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:12,540
I'm there is this

574
00:34:12,540 --> 00:34:16,550
are kinda impressive with don't think
you might have to worry about

575
00:34:16,550 --> 00:34:19,610
these are all the things that won't
necessarily keep you up here but might

576
00:34:19,610 --> 00:34:20,800
be a problem

577
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:25,510
though it included if you're in a border
zone I'm close to Mexico or Canada you

578
00:34:25,510 --> 00:34:26,700
have extra growth

579
00:34:26,700 --> 00:34:30,200
if their nearby AM stations you have to
worry

580
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:33,930
on about your tower interfering with
them because

581
00:34:33,929 --> 00:34:38,429
FN towers can be approximately the same
height as an AM antenna

582
00:34:38,429 --> 00:34:41,929
on there's protected

583
00:34:41,929 --> 00:34:46,899
site these are things like f50
monitoring stations and on

584
00:34:46,900 --> 00:34:51,400
their radio astronomy quiet down and

585
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:55,150
that the upper right now there actually
more things to worry about that aren't

586
00:34:55,150 --> 00:34:56,910
even included here

587
00:34:56,909 --> 00:35:00,160
and I your bigger coverage map

588
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:03,500
and that's about it we have

589
00:35:03,500 --> 00:35:07,070
paid for next step that they're not yet
implemented which

590
00:35:07,070 --> 00:35:09,920
eyes partly because we have been
implemented up and partly because the

591
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:15,370
FTC has been implemented this stuff get

592
00:35:15,370 --> 00:35:22,370
Donna anything up

593
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:29,040
yellow tho the the other the tulip
Maggie in public the

594
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:32,830
and other people have been collaborate
in an hour

595
00:35:32,830 --> 00:35:35,840
it it's actually it looks a little bit

596
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:41,160
a like really a Alan R complicated
sometimes doing all this really specific

597
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:45,770
part but the tool is really gonna be a
really helpful for that we can't because

598
00:35:45,770 --> 00:35:48,440
I've made with and the somewhere there's
already there

599
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:52,730
it is really expensive and I don't think
that you can share

600
00:35:52,730 --> 00:35:55,780
the back you can really share the

601
00:35:55,780 --> 00:36:00,890
password or whatever on saw doubt the
really big limitation for people who

602
00:36:00,890 --> 00:36:04,600
want to apply for stations and update
the just

603
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:09,580
if it's a really big he is but is just
her in the application is just

604
00:36:09,580 --> 00:36:15,330
maybe a page of death whole complicated
up process for the application

605
00:36:15,330 --> 00:36:18,509
so it's just that I love the part of the
whole process and

606
00:36:18,510 --> 00:36:22,020
infirmities we're just working to try to
supplier not just

607
00:36:22,020 --> 00:36:25,540
the technical support but then also like
a policy

608
00:36:25,540 --> 00:36:29,390
and you know I help people to find ways
to

609
00:36:29,390 --> 00:36:33,870
funder a a to connect with other
networks and

610
00:36:33,870 --> 00:36:36,890
it just like a little part of the work
that we do a promiscuous

611
00:36:36,890 --> 00:36:40,029
from so yeah updated and again

612
00:36:40,030 --> 00:36:43,730
just something by the again we're
building and out more read it at Miller

613
00:36:43,730 --> 00:36:44,730
said Newman

614
00:36:44,730 --> 00:36:49,260
I so I hope to see you there and if you
have questions

615
00:36:49,260 --> 00:36:52,390
home this day opportunity well

616
00:36:52,390 --> 00:36:56,069
and we're request FINA think we did a
fifteen dollar donation

617
00:36:56,070 --> 00:36:59,120
for parts for the transmitter building
on

618
00:36:59,120 --> 00:37:02,730
by if you don't have fifteen dollars in
you still wanna Connie should definitely

619
00:37:02,730 --> 00:37:04,560
come

620
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:07,600
are okay I up

621
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:11,180
yeah go ahead yep you have a question
come up to the mic to get recorded

622
00:37:11,180 --> 00:37:14,879
so have a question for you about the the

623
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:19,290
covered well a actually two questions
but is

624
00:37:19,290 --> 00:37:23,160
is there a specific exemption for
simulcast

625
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:28,140
for LPFM where's there's not for fold
broadcast in other words to sink

626
00:37:28,140 --> 00:37:32,509
transmitters to cover a larger area re
could have to 100

627
00:37:32,510 --> 00:37:35,570
power 101 transmitters that

628
00:37:35,570 --> 00:37:39,260
still meet the criteria that are on the
same frequency or is that like

629
00:37:39,260 --> 00:37:42,610
with LPFM that the hard question on

630
00:37:42,610 --> 00:37:48,490
so good as for the FTC's concerned
there's not really a simulcast category

631
00:37:48,490 --> 00:37:49,710
but they're

632
00:37:49,710 --> 00:37:52,790
some other similar option tho one of
them

633
00:37:52,790 --> 00:37:55,820
is getting and at the entrance

634
00:37:55,820 --> 00:37:59,090
by translator or blister station which
would

635
00:37:59,090 --> 00:38:03,460
rebroadcast your signal either on the
plane I frequency or on a different

636
00:38:03,460 --> 00:38:04,380
frequency

637
00:38:04,380 --> 00:38:08,000
on and that the math because there if
it's big

638
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:11,090
application window for translators on

639
00:38:11,090 --> 00:38:15,350
years ago where a lotta organizations on

640
00:38:15,350 --> 00:38:18,720
applied for like two thousand
translators and

641
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:23,360
on threatened to take out all the spaces
that could be used for smaller community

642
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:26,370
groups that don't want to apply for two
thousand patients

643
00:38:26,370 --> 00:38:29,589
on an aide I

644
00:38:29,590 --> 00:38:33,770
the FCC decided to freeze all of those
applications in till they figured out

645
00:38:33,770 --> 00:38:34,780
what to do

646
00:38:34,780 --> 00:38:38,850
and right now they're in the process
throwing out a lot of those applications

647
00:38:38,850 --> 00:38:40,640
where they would block potential

648
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:45,330
low-power FM opportunities on but
leaving them with them in and processing

649
00:38:45,330 --> 00:38:46,600
some other than tho

650
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:50,740
the the goal on the if you'd actually

651
00:38:50,740 --> 00:38:54,620
now mandated by law from the new law
that passed on to balance those two

652
00:38:54,620 --> 00:38:56,430
services to make sure they

653
00:38:56,430 --> 00:38:59,560
there's room for new people who are
originating signaled and not just for

654
00:38:59,560 --> 00:39:02,350
people who are be broadcasting someone
else's signal

655
00:39:02,350 --> 00:39:05,509
on so there is the possibility that the

656
00:39:05,510 --> 00:39:09,230
low-power station on could

657
00:39:09,230 --> 00:39:13,160
get somebody else who has a translator
to rebroadcast their signal

658
00:39:13,160 --> 00:39:17,259
and they're not currently allowed to
have their own translators on

659
00:39:17,260 --> 00:39:20,740
but that usually hard to do translators
tend to cost a lot

660
00:39:20,740 --> 00:39:24,320
on their kinda hard to come by through
the other possibility would just be

661
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:27,000
applying for two channels and then

662
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:31,880
a rainbow still the same content on any
that currently not allowed

663
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:35,180
on there's some talk bit hasn't quite

664
00:39:35,180 --> 00:39:39,890
panned out yet about allowing more than
one channel per organization

665
00:39:39,890 --> 00:39:44,609
on but not more than maybe three

666
00:39:44,610 --> 00:39:48,350
who this something that's been kind has
been in my head since your talk from the

667
00:39:48,350 --> 00:39:49,799
last hope conference

668
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:55,460
arm we do work in a a in a business
water village in Gonaives Haiti

669
00:39:55,460 --> 00:39:58,740
and we're talking to folks down there
last summer down there in April

670
00:39:58,740 --> 00:40:02,370
about community the potential the
community radio station

671
00:40:02,370 --> 00:40:05,870
and we definitely have some interest so
I was hoping I could

672
00:40:05,870 --> 00:40:09,120
maybe talk somebody a little bit later
today maybe at the workshop about the

673
00:40:09,120 --> 00:40:13,450
potential for project like that

674
00:40:13,450 --> 00:40:18,830
sure I am I think peter is also here

675
00:40:18,830 --> 00:40:22,850
3 hand every day yaa peter is one other
person

676
00:40:22,850 --> 00:40:26,640
here's the is one of the main person
their star from it is

677
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:29,720
project on and he is on a person the

678
00:40:29,720 --> 00:40:34,450
its work and an international level so I
demand he might be

679
00:40:34,450 --> 00:40:41,130
your person here

680
00:40:41,130 --> 00:40:44,290
um is this our just for FM

681
00:40:44,290 --> 00:40:47,990
also for a.m. just for FN

682
00:40:47,990 --> 00:40:52,280
there is currently no on non-commercial

683
00:40:52,280 --> 00:40:57,720
low-power a.m. service on there a couple
of people who are interested in that and

684
00:40:57,720 --> 00:40:58,510
pushing for

685
00:40:58,510 --> 00:41:03,440
on it not one of the things that for me
P it has taken up as an initiate

686
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:07,050
but the power limitations 10,001+ sorry

687
00:41:07,050 --> 00:41:10,870
up for life in the AM yeah up the FM

688
00:41:10,870 --> 00:41:14,640
%uh LPFM is currently a 100 watt limit
and

689
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:19,740
me gay increase to my case 250 in the
new world

690
00:41:19,740 --> 00:41:23,820
1 but these new rules having yet been
published his address

691
00:41:23,820 --> 00:41:30,820
we wish they had yeah rethinking get

692
00:41:33,840 --> 00:41:37,220
I am a ham operator and that

693
00:41:37,220 --> 00:41:40,310
never underestimate the

694
00:41:40,310 --> 00:41:44,060
support they can be offered to the him
community special in the RF

695
00:41:44,060 --> 00:41:47,380
engineering psych granted they don't
know much about the media side and so

696
00:41:47,380 --> 00:41:48,070
forth

697
00:41:48,070 --> 00:41:51,590
but has there been any efforts to tell
your work to

698
00:41:51,590 --> 00:41:57,420
with the ARRL our be found the community
support ever not supporter

699
00:41:57,420 --> 00:42:01,700
um I can withstand the beginning I'm we
are trying to recruit more engineers and

700
00:42:01,700 --> 00:42:05,550
people have the expertise and they can I
am not disappoint with a

701
00:42:05,550 --> 00:42:08,820
equipment and you know the actual a

702
00:42:08,820 --> 00:42:12,880
building the station that the can also
provide support for

703
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:17,240
I'll when we're doing all this study is
so given the can explain to people

704
00:42:17,240 --> 00:42:21,960
I like them but things sometimes you
know like whether the transmitter sigh

705
00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:25,050
what is the equipment that you need to
play thing that has been their side how

706
00:42:25,050 --> 00:42:28,200
radio waves to work you know I'll how
the signal get the

707
00:42:28,200 --> 00:42:32,670
broadcast so on if you're one of the
Spurs are so you know anybody that can

708
00:42:32,670 --> 00:42:33,810
help with that

709
00:42:33,810 --> 00:42:38,120
just as worrying questions it it's a lot
because I can't think that's a lot of

710
00:42:38,120 --> 00:42:38,720
people this

711
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:43,810
calling us every day in the have all
cancer random questions they're like you

712
00:42:43,810 --> 00:42:44,400
know

713
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:47,580
where can I get funds for Mary decision
on

714
00:42:47,580 --> 00:42:51,230
whether the transmitter side and we just
have to be answering this question so

715
00:42:51,230 --> 00:42:52,830
that way we had the religious part

716
00:42:52,830 --> 00:42:55,860
so I encourage people is here to create
an account

717
00:42:55,860 --> 00:42:59,380
and do not just to offer you going out
with that

718
00:42:59,380 --> 00:43:02,850
in the ham radio community is a thing
called an elmer which is usually some

719
00:43:02,850 --> 00:43:04,009
old guy that

720
00:43:04,010 --> 00:43:07,640
you know has been in radio for 25 years
and helped bring along people in

721
00:43:07,640 --> 00:43:11,259
just having that available simple
questions up talk after about trying to

722
00:43:11,260 --> 00:43:13,190
hook up the two communities

723
00:43:13,190 --> 00:43:18,710
thank you that's a great resource we
we've also been connecting recently with

724
00:43:18,710 --> 00:43:20,280
the short wait community

725
00:43:20,280 --> 00:43:25,050
on thanks to our and see here I which is
another good opportunity to recruit

726
00:43:25,050 --> 00:43:26,380
people who

727
00:43:26,380 --> 00:43:30,560
I maybe don't know the specifics how the
FTC

728
00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:34,350
make their rules about low power FM
station banking galanter

729
00:43:34,350 --> 00:43:38,650
like to the questions that people have
been can also throw good idea is our way

730
00:43:38,650 --> 00:43:42,690
on about you know may be due to a would
be good or maybe this would be a good

731
00:43:42,690 --> 00:43:45,710
way to get people connected with the
right side

732
00:43:45,710 --> 00:43:49,630
a muscle ham radio operator in many them
be very good on engineering side because

733
00:43:49,630 --> 00:43:53,880
fair number our broadcast engineers my
question is are you familiar with the

734
00:43:53,880 --> 00:43:55,560
organization Free Press

735
00:43:55,560 --> 00:43:59,460
was there are I mean they offer maybe
said this at the beginning saigon

736
00:43:59,460 --> 00:44:04,260
intently but they will offer help with
the FCC license in frail PFM

737
00:44:04,260 --> 00:44:08,560
on we are definitely familiar with Free
Press they were one of our big allied

738
00:44:08,560 --> 00:44:13,870
impacting a lot recently on and it very

739
00:44:13,870 --> 00:44:17,529
I don't actually know specific services
if they have for helping people get

740
00:44:17,530 --> 00:44:18,790
licensed on

741
00:44:18,790 --> 00:44:22,070
but they have a lot of services for II

742
00:44:22,070 --> 00:44:25,420
helping people advocate for themselves
on a national level

743
00:44:25,420 --> 00:44:29,270
and also just helping raise awareness
about these issues that we've been

744
00:44:29,270 --> 00:44:30,690
talking about

745
00:44:30,690 --> 00:44:33,650
yeah that would be good they help out
locally too so you might wanna look into

746
00:44:33,650 --> 00:44:35,290
that

747
00:44:35,290 --> 00:44:38,940
we're also working with other
organizations there like or partner

748
00:44:38,940 --> 00:44:44,040
and the idea was to I to try just to
have you not read more capacities since

749
00:44:44,040 --> 00:44:46,090
we are seven people in primitive

750
00:44:46,090 --> 00:44:49,490
and it's like 100 for people who want to
start stations on

751
00:44:49,490 --> 00:44:54,270
so we're we have a i think a pre-printed
whenever partners a

752
00:44:54,270 --> 00:44:59,350
me demobilizing project magnet I

753
00:44:59,350 --> 00:45:02,890
common frequency in California I can
really think all the lease

754
00:45:02,890 --> 00:45:05,930
there we're partnering with but the
thing is

755
00:45:05,930 --> 00:45:09,149
I love this partners there are more
committed to do outreach is still

756
00:45:09,150 --> 00:45:13,130
to let people know that there's gonna be
this opportunity but when we add them

757
00:45:13,130 --> 00:45:17,330
are working to support the 12 offer they
don't really feel comfort the window for

758
00:45:17,330 --> 00:45:19,279
in their technical support

759
00:45:19,280 --> 00:45:23,720
so where feel like I'm really you know
like trying to find people they want to

760
00:45:23,720 --> 00:45:24,830
help us with that

761
00:45:24,830 --> 00:45:29,130
because that that mainly in all I where
is gonna be people's gonna have in more

762
00:45:29,130 --> 00:45:32,340
trouble on filling the application
because there's not enough people to

763
00:45:32,340 --> 00:45:33,530
support

764
00:45:33,530 --> 00:45:36,760
so yeah again got through this book

765
00:45:36,760 --> 00:45:40,260
hmm

766
00:45:40,260 --> 00:45:43,720
um I was curious with the lake
maintenance

767
00:45:43,720 --> 00:45:47,420
are like support status so that software
that

768
00:45:47,420 --> 00:45:50,990
you word demonstrating in San like what

769
00:45:50,990 --> 00:45:54,120
like what's the deal with a own

770
00:45:54,120 --> 00:45:58,120
I are you talking specifically about the
first piece of software that back in

771
00:45:58,120 --> 00:45:59,040
herbal and

772
00:45:59,040 --> 00:46:02,529
I guess specifically like that
calculator

773
00:46:02,530 --> 00:46:07,990
yet arm preview is committed to
maintaining and supporting that software

774
00:46:07,990 --> 00:46:09,250
which includes

775
00:46:09,250 --> 00:46:14,340
on improving it II entry through the end
of an application window

776
00:46:14,340 --> 00:46:17,540
on we haven't decided on

777
00:46:17,540 --> 00:46:21,150
whether keeping it up and running after
that a

778
00:46:21,150 --> 00:46:26,130
on priority but it also has indeed it's
free and open source and if we don't

779
00:46:26,130 --> 00:46:29,200
want killing somebody else thinks it's
worth while there's no reason someone

780
00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:30,820
else can take it over

781
00:46:30,820 --> 00:46:34,210
it's like hosted on: get over something
like that I'm

782
00:46:34,210 --> 00:46:40,790
yeah it good infant itself is running is
hosted on for mediated servers

783
00:46:40,790 --> 00:46:44,420
on but is a on

784
00:46:44,420 --> 00:46:48,550
the source code again yeah it's worth
food is available online through

785
00:46:48,550 --> 00:46:49,580
Savannah

786
00:46:49,580 --> 00:46:53,210
on and I think that there's a link to it
on the radio mark page

787
00:46:53,210 --> 00:46:56,320
and if there's not a make sure that
there is by the end of the day

788
00:46:56,320 --> 00:46:59,650
on you can see the source code and you
can see day II

789
00:46:59,650 --> 00:47:06,609
issue tracker in the wiki that we've
been using for cool

790
00:47:06,609 --> 00:47:10,090
regarding the the tool are free to all I
think it's really great

791
00:47:10,090 --> 00:47:13,800
congratulations to you guys for building
a arm

792
00:47:13,800 --> 00:47:19,450
my question good

793
00:47:19,450 --> 00:47:23,420
my question is about a I live in
Brooklyn and obviously it's a high

794
00:47:23,420 --> 00:47:26,710
highly contested area are there power

795
00:47:26,710 --> 00:47:31,420
licenses for power levels below 100
watts or is that it

796
00:47:31,420 --> 00:47:34,830
%uh very ok left the station on the
books

797
00:47:34,830 --> 00:47:38,310
for 10 what and I don't remember off the
top of my head

798
00:47:38,310 --> 00:47:41,620
it what the 10 what options are around
here on

799
00:47:41,620 --> 00:47:45,380
you can actually do an arc research and
change the power level from

800
00:47:45,380 --> 00:47:50,220
a hundred what the 10 lakh MT on the
problem is that the FTC had never

801
00:47:50,220 --> 00:47:51,370
actually

802
00:47:51,370 --> 00:47:55,290
I'm allowed people to apply for those
licenses mostly because a

803
00:47:55,290 --> 00:47:58,650
the coverage area smiling up with 10 lot
built in most cases

804
00:47:58,650 --> 00:48:02,250
on it's hard to generate enough money to
maintain

805
00:48:02,250 --> 00:48:06,609
station on we have been talking at fifty
about

806
00:48:06,609 --> 00:48:11,520
either on starting to allow 10 much
stations or doing an intermediate fifty

807
00:48:11,520 --> 00:48:12,060
what

808
00:48:12,060 --> 00:48:15,080
arm option and a odd that

809
00:48:15,080 --> 00:48:19,660
still in question will find out when the
Rose come out now I'm really great place

810
00:48:19,660 --> 00:48:23,470
in my neighborhood 10 lots would reach
exact house in the people

811
00:48:23,470 --> 00:48:27,220
site I'll be amazing what's good in one
neighborhood might not be getting an

812
00:48:27,220 --> 00:48:28,590
array neighborhood to wear

813
00:48:28,590 --> 00:48:32,260
hoping to get more options thanks

814
00:48:32,260 --> 00:48:36,060
just one more thing I think the we have
to finish we have to grab up

815
00:48:36,060 --> 00:48:40,220
up so we're gonna be in urbana-champaign
there's gonna be added rather is really

816
00:48:40,220 --> 00:48:42,820
a conference temperament is is gonna be
helpin

817
00:48:42,820 --> 00:48:46,240
I at the camp there we're gonna have a
low power FM clinic

818
00:48:46,240 --> 00:48:50,940
out so it's gonna be a whole day of work
shows they're designed just for people

819
00:48:50,940 --> 00:48:52,590
who want to sorry decisions

820
00:48:52,590 --> 00:48:56,240
so it's gonna be there 20 62 the 29 July

821
00:48:56,240 --> 00:48:59,400
I saw I thing decide is run through

822
00:48:59,400 --> 00:49:03,890
radio conference now or so you know
anybody that live close to

823
00:49:03,890 --> 00:49:07,740
really knows we're gonna be there

824
00:49:07,740 --> 00:49:12,160
we could probably take one more quick
question

825
00:49:12,160 --> 00:49:14,790
if I recall correctly the last time
there was license opening there is

826
00:49:14,790 --> 00:49:16,000
credible and Graham

827
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:19,730
and I wondered if if that's something
that you're concerned about

828
00:49:19,730 --> 00:49:23,770
with this round with the new rules come
out and aim clearly you guys are really

829
00:49:23,770 --> 00:49:24,470
prepared by

830
00:49:24,470 --> 00:49:29,190
think congratulate you on that eyes was
wonder if this isn't emergency there

831
00:49:29,190 --> 00:49:32,980
yet we're absolutely anticipating a land
grab on

832
00:49:32,980 --> 00:49:36,280
good thing we've been trying to do too
most to prepare for that

833
00:49:36,280 --> 00:49:40,690
is when a lot of people applied for the
same channel and the FCC has a point

834
00:49:40,690 --> 00:49:43,020
system they use to decide who wins

835
00:49:43,020 --> 00:49:47,670
on and so we've been both advocating for
points that we think

836
00:49:47,670 --> 00:49:51,650
on are the most reflective a group that
are really rooted in their community and

837
00:49:51,650 --> 00:49:53,940
likely to serve their communities and a

838
00:49:53,940 --> 00:49:57,980
on trying to push the group that we're
working with

839
00:49:57,980 --> 00:50:01,609
to do the things they would need to do
to it on be able to get the most points

840
00:50:01,609 --> 00:50:04,200
possible

841
00:50:04,200 --> 00:50:07,400
I think that's it thanks everyone I hope
we will see you at noon
