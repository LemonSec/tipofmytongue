in concluding the site should be
classified as a terrorist target

279
00:17:22,459 --> 00:17:26,470
rather than a public forum the courts
ensured the public domain

morning import house

624
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:06,800
here's a recreation a paradise square in
the mid-nineteenth century

625
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:11,140
and we've lost our video which would
have been dubbed Martin Scorsese's Gangs

626
00:39:11,140 --> 00:39:16,129
of New York which in 2000 to advance the

00:39:26,120 --> 00:39:31,150
and robust vox populi as well as side a
brutal confrontation between nativist

in immigrants scorcese's movie poster
makes the claim

632
00:39:36,430 --> 00:39:41,180
america was born in the streets this
controversial notion locator been

633
00:39:41,180 --> 00:39:43,580
struggling Center for American history

634
00:39:43,580 --> 00:39:47,630
an urban area did that runs counter to
the Popular Front earpieces

635
00:39:47,630 --> 00:39:50,859
which elderly out that the american def
ass was forge

636
00:39:50,859 --> 00:39:55,819
along the advancing frontier in not
narrative that had a decidedly anterior

637
00:39:55,820 --> 00:39:56,990
been contacts

638
00:39:56,990 --> 00:40:02,830
and subjects

639
00:40:02,830 --> 00:40:07,520
and so we are left to consider absent or
video of an Occupy

640
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:12,839
that moment the proposition that America
was born in the streets

641
00:40:12,839 --> 00:40:16,520
that the proposition that America was
born in the streets is embedded in the

642
00:40:16,520 --> 00:40:19,480
very archaeology at the global city

643
00:40:19,480 --> 00:40:22,680
the NYPD technical assistance Response
Unit

644
00:40:22,680 --> 00:40:26,960
Tyrel is ever ready to film protesters
to inform

645
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:31,430
the counterterrorist awareness a domain
but to really know the city is to be

646
00:40:31,430 --> 00:40:34,879
constituted in and through its public
domain

647
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:40,430
and to know the city is to be is to
continue to strategize robust

648
00:40:40,430 --> 00:40:45,839
transparent assembly as an antidote to
encroaching security sensors

649
00:40:45,839 --> 00:40:51,509
and erasures

650
00:40:51,510 --> 00:40:55,280
and so now mister young

651
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:58,380
if you would like to

652
00:40:58,380 --> 00:41:05,380
carry on

653
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:19,630
now we do would like who are discussed
be

654
00:41:19,630 --> 00:41:22,950
and tutoring stealer going around the
country

655
00:41:22,950 --> 00:41:26,730
am i doing okay and that better

656
00:41:26,730 --> 00:41:29,970
own core research that we've been
working on now for almost 15 years with

657
00:41:29,970 --> 00:41:31,930
her funny antidotes to the growth of

658
00:41:31,930 --> 00:41:37,220
of security over the populace in this is
an example of what we're working on our

659
00:41:37,220 --> 00:41:38,400
website crypto

660
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:42,660
complexion documents for them but we
certainly don't think the best way to go

661
00:41:42,660 --> 00:41:43,170
about it

662
00:41:43,170 --> 00:41:47,100
that we think for better is to have
public discussion participation in this

663
00:41:47,100 --> 00:41:47,860
process

664
00:41:47,860 --> 00:41:50,930
it is because it's been that the

665
00:41:50,930 --> 00:41:54,230
has been a huge industry group's

666
00:41:54,230 --> 00:41:55,660
911

667
00:41:55,660 --> 00:42:00,710
restricting Security Studies to group
home

668
00:42:00,710 --> 00:42:03,799
past classification for security and
that

669
00:42:03,799 --> 00:42:06,799
more and more the public's been cut out
this process

670
00:42:06,799 --> 00:42:09,829
and we think that open discussion this
is was

671
00:42:09,829 --> 00:42:13,930
needed to counter the business of
security

672
00:42:13,930 --> 00:42:17,149
and that is now the dominant industry
right now

673
00:42:17,150 --> 00:42:21,720
and that is getting even heavier push
right now on the Internet so

674
00:42:21,720 --> 00:42:26,490
today would like to least foster some
public discussion about the topic about

675
00:42:26,490 --> 00:42:27,630
where we go next

676
00:42:27,630 --> 00:42:31,200
Fig

677
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:36,410
questions comments are welcome
