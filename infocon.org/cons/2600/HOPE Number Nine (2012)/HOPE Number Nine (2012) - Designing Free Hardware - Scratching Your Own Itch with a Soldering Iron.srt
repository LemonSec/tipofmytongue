1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:03,490
grim everyone member

2
00:00:03,490 --> 00:00:08,960
their an American it doesn't matter

3
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:12,490
nobody okay but you're I got it because
awesome

4
00:00:12,490 --> 00:00:15,870
who are about to hear it run out as I
can remember

5
00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:19,539
so I decided to quit talking to the
board till it's over

6
00:00:19,539 --> 00:00:24,170
take a razor I'm higher by special go
back there

7
00:00:24,170 --> 00:00:27,810
is awesome a mines mod this is Tam

8
00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:30,929
I and I like you said when I talk to you
today about

9
00:00:30,929 --> 00:00:34,930
designing free hardware are scratching
their own H when a Saturn

10
00:00:34,930 --> 00:00:38,780
that happened that night and

11
00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:43,329
so I get paid stupid questions I mean a

12
00:00:43,329 --> 00:00:47,170
perfect last question that way a the
first thing

13
00:00:47,170 --> 00:00:51,550
people always ask him a timeout period
whereas so you'd give me a hassle free

14
00:00:51,550 --> 00:00:52,129
stuff

15
00:00:52,129 --> 00:00:55,399
and now nothing is free

16
00:00:55,399 --> 00:00:58,770
except freedom so it's

17
00:00:58,770 --> 00:01:01,910
it means presence Beach not as in beer I
am

18
00:01:01,910 --> 00:01:06,520
next question people often ask is set so
how is this different

19
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:09,539
than anything else any other electronics
but you might have

20
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:14,140
and so you can break up electronics and
really into a few

21
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:19,330
separate categories um the first one as
well I refer to as close hardware

22
00:01:19,330 --> 00:01:22,630
and it's not exactly what you would
think from

23
00:01:22,630 --> 00:01:25,740
it's not like your toaster for something
else I would say

24
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:28,740
cost hardware worries I like a DVD
player

25
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:32,970
that actively works against you and that
you can fast-forward through previews

26
00:01:32,970 --> 00:01:37,780
because somebody somewhere hate you
region coding and everything

27
00:01:37,780 --> 00:01:41,180
right other limitations that you cannot
change on the device

28
00:01:41,180 --> 00:01:44,560
that you paid for with your own damn
money and

29
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:48,030
use however you want and some this this
kind of stuff is

30
00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:51,780
is exceptionally bad and raids 80
percent

31
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:55,299
freedom on my scale on

32
00:01:55,299 --> 00:01:59,320
and then you have this kinda
middle-ground further up the chain armed

33
00:01:59,320 --> 00:01:59,780
with

34
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:03,119
Apple hardware and so like for example
add

35
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:06,280
the first bang I really wrote source
code for

36
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:10,640
um that was on a computer was at my
Dreamcast a

37
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:14,160
early on some hackers found a way to get
around the

38
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:17,870
when the system boots it checks for a
key to make sure that the games are

39
00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:19,590
signed by distributors

40
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:22,910
and so that you can only run safe games
approved by

41
00:02:22,910 --> 00:02:27,040
sector and very early on people found
the key

42
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:32,799
arm and overnight everybody had started
boarding emulators the machine and other

43
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:33,379
things

44
00:02:33,379 --> 00:02:36,970
and I was able to write a hello world
code and

45
00:02:36,970 --> 00:02:41,310
push coat over the network and and a lot
of fun things with it an anime

46
00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:45,090
gorgeous crime it really became my
device I was able to do

47
00:02:45,090 --> 00:02:49,370
anything I come up with that and bangs
that the in manufacturer never intended

48
00:02:49,370 --> 00:02:49,910
for

49
00:02:49,910 --> 00:02:53,569
I went through a similar thing play with
a PSP

50
00:02:53,569 --> 00:02:57,170
when I pick that consular I thought this
is really great hardware and a great

51
00:02:57,170 --> 00:02:58,900
package but I couldn't do anything with
it

52
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:02,510
without cracking it open and and and
Hackett and I got to a point where I

53
00:03:02,510 --> 00:03:05,310
could run Linux and I could run my own
code on it and that's kind of where I

54
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:06,680
wanted to be with it

55
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:10,640
and so with these kinda bangs you can
get about halfway there

56
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:14,019
I would on Freescale know the freedom to
mention its

57
00:03:14,019 --> 00:03:18,760
it's around 50 percent and which is good
for a lot of bangs

58
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:23,450
I but not all the way there yet so the
next thing up on the list

59
00:03:23,450 --> 00:03:27,080
actually is what what most people have
been talking about this weekend at the

60
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:27,840
convention

61
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:31,849
is open source hardware and to open
source hardware

62
00:03:31,849 --> 00:03:35,659
is hardware electrons just like anything
else but

63
00:03:35,659 --> 00:03:39,250
it is licensed to you under a copyleft
license

64
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:42,940
so that you are free to modify the
hardware

65
00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:46,370
the schematics for the hardware are
available often the Gerbers are

66
00:03:46,370 --> 00:03:47,090
available

67
00:03:47,090 --> 00:03:50,360
everything you need to reproduce the
device yourself

68
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:53,670
is there and you can make improvements
and share them with the community

69
00:03:53,670 --> 00:03:54,459
everything

70
00:03:54,459 --> 00:03:59,060
is really there and there are a lot of
great examples of this

71
00:03:59,060 --> 00:04:03,870
for example the TVB gonna mitch is here
this week and I think even get a

72
00:04:03,870 --> 00:04:05,260
lightning talk about it a

73
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:08,679
earlier and a really great big copper

74
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:12,080
just about everything and so

75
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:15,230
it rates really high on the the freedom
to mention

76
00:04:15,230 --> 00:04:18,350
at 98 percent Saturday

77
00:04:18,350 --> 00:04:22,180
for effort up but US

78
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:25,550
why doesn't a good all the way what what
makes it different than what I would

79
00:04:25,550 --> 00:04:26,910
call free hardware

80
00:04:26,910 --> 00:04:32,350
and a distinction as that must've the
projects that are called open source

81
00:04:32,350 --> 00:04:33,110
hardware

82
00:04:33,110 --> 00:04:36,139
are currently being built with
proprietary software

83
00:04:36,139 --> 00:04:40,699
arm a very popular option is Eagle which
comes in a frame in addition

84
00:04:40,699 --> 00:04:43,800
which allows you to build up for by
Teresa keyboards

85
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:46,949
um with two layers an

86
00:04:46,949 --> 00:04:51,310
so many routes so many other limitations
but you can do a lot in that little

87
00:04:51,310 --> 00:04:52,470
sandbox

88
00:04:52,470 --> 00:04:57,199
and and because a bad so many people
just not care

89
00:04:57,199 --> 00:05:00,910
because they can design a low circuit
board and by little I mean they're great

90
00:05:00,910 --> 00:05:01,590
product like

91
00:05:01,590 --> 00:05:04,930
the art we know as an example and
something built using Eagle

92
00:05:04,930 --> 00:05:08,530
and has taken the world by storm but

93
00:05:08,530 --> 00:05:11,770
if you wanted to you modify it you're
going to have to use this proprietary

94
00:05:11,770 --> 00:05:14,120
program on your machine

95
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:17,130
and so 1x3 hardware different

96
00:05:17,130 --> 00:05:20,400
is free hardware is built from the
ground

97
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:24,910
up using free software or open source
software

98
00:05:24,910 --> 00:05:27,919
so there is a great example of this

99
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:31,210
and in the rap rap project the rapper
project

100
00:05:31,210 --> 00:05:34,479
is built using jeeter which is a up

101
00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:39,349
free software program that the allows
you to design certain words from scratch

102
00:05:39,350 --> 00:05:44,199
and so n/a I guess it really fits with
the whole Rep rap spirit met you

103
00:05:44,199 --> 00:05:48,350
you build the printer from scratch even
replicated and then you can go and make

104
00:05:48,350 --> 00:05:49,400
changes with the software

105
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:53,280
all staying in the and side the freedom
to mention

106
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:57,250
and so free software merits on the
freedoms go actually

107
00:05:57,250 --> 00:06:01,360
just a 95 it's just a little bit better
is not a hundred percent

108
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:05,520
and the problem with the pre hardware
arm

109
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:09,289
is that really in all electronics
everything is still

110
00:06:09,289 --> 00:06:13,830
a black box and so to get to what I
would call freedom plus plus

111
00:06:13,830 --> 00:06:17,490
a you would have to have gone to the top
yesterday

112
00:06:17,490 --> 00:06:20,910
where he talked about printing I your
own circuit boards i may not answer

113
00:06:20,910 --> 00:06:22,250
towards our own

114
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:26,410
a transistors I he gave a talk on out
was that does

115
00:06:26,410 --> 00:06:29,470
organic carbon yeah transistors

116
00:06:29,470 --> 00:06:32,780
a which are freed because

117
00:06:32,780 --> 00:06:36,370
right now the majority ball electronics
a

118
00:06:36,370 --> 00:06:40,430
are bildt's heroes back runway

119
00:06:40,430 --> 00:06:44,860
preview so the rap rap even though
everything on it is free disk maddocks

120
00:06:44,860 --> 00:06:47,860
you can get data sheets better give you
in-depth information

121
00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:50,860
on all the parts so you really would
have

122
00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:54,830
all the information Turtur to do it but

123
00:06:54,830 --> 00:06:59,080
the at magazine black box the motor
controllers are black boxes

124
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:02,250
ever everything on is a collection a
black boxes

125
00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:05,569
they have great documentation about how
to use them but they are

126
00:07:05,569 --> 00:07:09,199
ultimately black boxes and so it's just

127
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:14,430
always moving and a you know for the
curb to get down to 100 percent free and

128
00:07:14,430 --> 00:07:15,569
so I would say

129
00:07:15,569 --> 00:07:18,680
right now people have the option to hit
95

130
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:22,120
pretty easily and and that's what we're
going to be talking about today

131
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:26,919
is is using free software to develop
your free hardware

132
00:07:26,919 --> 00:07:30,139
and so then after I doctor's hospital

133
00:07:30,139 --> 00:07:33,360
there was a who cares this is Damon

134
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:36,590
why your free tarde

135
00:07:36,590 --> 00:07:40,090
Eagles easy Eagles if they and sell

136
00:07:40,090 --> 00:07:44,340
my first dances Agosto la manana now for

137
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:48,840
partner gotta no fight for your rights

138
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:51,900
and Ben I don't now I really don't care

139
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:55,259
Eagle works and I okay

140
00:07:55,259 --> 00:07:59,449
DeRay goes easy but there are problem
some

141
00:07:59,449 --> 00:08:03,490
there is to them as examples and the
free software community

142
00:08:03,490 --> 00:08:06,770
where this has really been people um
Java

143
00:08:06,770 --> 00:08:09,878
and beekeeper um the job people

144
00:08:09,879 --> 00:08:12,979
on Montreal's Obama news oracle has sued

145
00:08:12,979 --> 00:08:17,500
people for implementing Java which they
gave

146
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:21,139
to the world and

147
00:08:21,139 --> 00:08:25,530
thats so stupid what happened to the
exits and and all these people

148
00:08:25,530 --> 00:08:29,699
we're building stuff on job even though
it really wasn't fully open

149
00:08:29,699 --> 00:08:32,940
and people just didn't care because

150
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:36,659
why why does it matter they anticipated
that they were getting something free

151
00:08:36,659 --> 00:08:40,059
right because it was free as in beer not
speech

152
00:08:40,060 --> 00:08:44,380
and I was the problem in Bessemer from a
big keeper beekeeper was a deluge

153
00:08:44,380 --> 00:08:47,510
distributed version control system it
predates get

154
00:08:47,510 --> 00:08:51,230
and it was used by the crib minutes
chrono to maintain everythang

155
00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:54,720
and it was given to them for free by the
company because they want to be a nice

156
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:55,550
company

157
00:08:55,550 --> 00:08:58,670
but then one day somebody started
reverse engineering at who was a white

158
00:08:58,670 --> 00:08:59,479
girl hacker

159
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:03,300
and I said no take a ball go home and so
light was left

160
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:06,310
in in the dark about anything and some

161
00:09:06,310 --> 00:09:09,370
if you don't own it billinghurst your

162
00:09:09,370 --> 00:09:13,070
infrastructure on top of something is
very dangerous and so

163
00:09:13,070 --> 00:09:16,589
people should be aware that and that's
one point I would say

164
00:09:16,589 --> 00:09:19,709
and then max-1 is

165
00:09:19,709 --> 00:09:23,950
with the Free Software um my press
offered a job engine

166
00:09:23,950 --> 00:09:28,040
is that really the tools can be a lot
more creative to fill

167
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:31,870
certain ages a eagle is great and that
its

168
00:09:31,870 --> 00:09:35,120
it does everything and and a very
straightforward

169
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:39,120
steps but it doesn't have all the crazy
features that

170
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:43,399
a lot of the free software tools have
and I'm not get more into that

171
00:09:43,399 --> 00:09:47,010
and a little bit here and then filing
there are

172
00:09:47,010 --> 00:09:50,350
limitations even though it's free as in
beer like I said before there's a

173
00:09:50,350 --> 00:09:53,839
before by three I'm four inches squared

174
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:58,350
allowed major boards are only allowed
two layers going out some eight races

175
00:09:58,350 --> 00:10:03,329
a the beers are actually octagon there's
lotsa weird

176
00:10:03,329 --> 00:10:08,000
issues with with their software and and
it's all on their terms just whatever

177
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,470
they want to give you an imitation or
change for example

178
00:10:11,470 --> 00:10:15,980
at Eagle just change dollar formats arm
for the file formats and so everybody is

179
00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:17,200
having to upgrade

180
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:20,640
their samples overtime tend to be
compatible

181
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:23,680
an that doesn't really happen as often

182
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:27,800
pres offer because there's no reason we
want to push people to use a new version

183
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:28,920
of the software other than

184
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:32,740
it's better um

185
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:36,050
and so really thats that's why should be
free

186
00:10:36,050 --> 00:10:40,450
and now but you decide to be frame i'm
happy for decide to be very

187
00:10:40,450 --> 00:10:44,540
up there's a lot of options a a really
easy place to start

188
00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:48,430
a if you play with our greenhouses a
product conferencing

189
00:10:48,430 --> 00:10:51,529
it a allows you to easily

190
00:10:51,529 --> 00:10:56,640
rig up and pre build your arm

191
00:10:56,640 --> 00:11:00,010
what you want to build with your are
going alleged a breadboard up

192
00:11:00,010 --> 00:11:03,550
a schematic sand see that they're going
to work it has a nice

193
00:11:03,550 --> 00:11:08,290
the user interface that shows off by
Kelly D's resistors potentiometers

194
00:11:08,290 --> 00:11:11,949
are you just easily build projects and
its Alba and Dodge Magnum

195
00:11:11,950 --> 00:11:15,440
very visual but it won't allow you to go
mom

196
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:19,100
it makes it more difficult to do more
complicate things on it but it's a great

197
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:22,410
thing to start with and its
multi-platform runs on Mac

198
00:11:22,410 --> 00:11:26,040
and I'll Benelux our

199
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:30,689
next option actually I'm avatar as one
called i cud

200
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:33,870
its a cutie based a

201
00:11:33,870 --> 00:11:38,070
Edea and its very popular I would say

202
00:11:38,070 --> 00:11:41,950
a its probably more similar to Eagle if
people here

203
00:11:41,950 --> 00:11:45,070
want to you now have a smooth transition
our

204
00:11:45,070 --> 00:11:50,550
it's an all in one kinda setup your
cinematic struggling turi

205
00:11:50,550 --> 00:11:54,620
your footprints and everything kinda
ties together and even has

206
00:11:54,620 --> 00:11:58,240
really cool 3d upward a

207
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:02,510
but I would recommend it because unlike
UT

208
00:12:02,510 --> 00:12:05,709
an option it's an option and Minn

209
00:12:05,709 --> 00:12:09,410
another option is this project called
free PCB

210
00:12:09,410 --> 00:12:13,920
I've never used it before because did on
the runs on Windows

211
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:17,000
ed looks pretty though

212
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,560
I don't know anything more about it it
is free

213
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:24,790
what is up for tonight and that's why I
know nothing about

214
00:12:24,790 --> 00:12:28,420
Bassa possibly but a

215
00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:31,729
there has been an update on the line
product about it and Mike six months so

216
00:12:31,730 --> 00:12:32,600
I didn't really

217
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:36,010
dipper and there's another one

218
00:12:36,010 --> 00:12:39,319
written in top a Java and so it works on

219
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:42,850
Windows Mac and Linux it has some very
cool simulation

220
00:12:42,850 --> 00:12:46,310
stuff if you want to come to spice
things second simulator circuit

221
00:12:46,310 --> 00:12:50,800
an show how things work and also has 88
walls

222
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:56,300
I am ed's it's nice to have your big in
a job I would say

223
00:12:56,300 --> 00:12:59,790
and then finally we have the best tool
on we use

224
00:12:59,790 --> 00:13:03,660
the years Matt what's not my best but

225
00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:07,639
driver is a tad and it's called G to it
stands for GPL

226
00:13:07,639 --> 00:13:13,120
electronica Avril demyans this time
design design automation on a mission

227
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:16,260
a and france je to were Jetta

228
00:13:16,260 --> 00:13:20,630
yeah Jetta mostly depending on which
side of the pond you come from Sams

229
00:13:20,630 --> 00:13:25,120
right British people tend to say Jenna
up

230
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:28,790
hit as this is the schematics editor as
a schematic we've

231
00:13:28,790 --> 00:13:33,719
built but illogic eat just buy dollars
Magners pretty standard

232
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:37,540
a here's the PCB footprint editor and I

233
00:13:37,540 --> 00:13:41,079
layout and here is a good review

234
00:13:41,079 --> 00:13:46,149
a survey partially finished product here
and some

235
00:13:46,149 --> 00:13:49,600
name and G to our bed it's a it's built

236
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:52,740
and the unique style philosophy and net
its

237
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:56,760
a so each partner gene is a separate
program

238
00:13:56,760 --> 00:14:00,910
that you can chained together om to to
do your project

239
00:14:00,910 --> 00:14:04,029
and on several different programs and
you run the ball and

240
00:14:04,029 --> 00:14:08,620
in sequence and you get you build and so
it makes it really easy to

241
00:14:08,620 --> 00:14:12,529
it ever make file that says you know
take the schematic

242
00:14:12,529 --> 00:14:15,779
get the netlist taken and the the

243
00:14:15,779 --> 00:14:19,920
layout program get the layout get the
Gerbers

244
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:23,269
sent Oct factory and so that's really
nice

245
00:14:23,269 --> 00:14:27,089
on and like us and so it's easy to
segment the workflow so in particular a

246
00:14:27,089 --> 00:14:28,529
must for our projects

247
00:14:28,529 --> 00:14:31,760
I will do a lot of the work on building
the schematic

248
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:35,170
and figure now apart we need to use them
or not and then I will

249
00:14:35,170 --> 00:14:38,630
while I'm still working I will say
tamarin use these parts

250
00:14:38,630 --> 00:14:42,639
start building footprints for them and
start thinking about the layout of the

251
00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:47,279
the board well i'd I spend all my time
doing this so we can really I'm

252
00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:51,209
get a home in time and montane and must
not soon as he's done with that

253
00:14:51,209 --> 00:14:54,680
you can send those files to me that I
can then

254
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:58,089
actually nail down the PCB designers
it's finished

255
00:14:58,089 --> 00:15:01,329
right and he only really needs to look
at the output what I've done

256
00:15:01,329 --> 00:15:06,000
generally because it's all he needs and
so it really is good if you're working

257
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,070
with the team

258
00:15:07,070 --> 00:15:10,440
on especially because a large break up
the work

259
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:13,899
um one the other bands I would say love
it is a

260
00:15:13,899 --> 00:15:17,190
their file format for all of the
different parts jeeter

261
00:15:17,190 --> 00:15:20,760
RJR just text files a and so

262
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:24,389
you wanna nice things as you can change
them outside ago we can go n

263
00:15:24,389 --> 00:15:27,889
just over a text file a texter change
the comment

264
00:15:27,889 --> 00:15:31,279
you can catch on as you can you can just
move things around easily in their

265
00:15:31,279 --> 00:15:34,389
the use cases where that's almost easier
to do that word

266
00:15:34,389 --> 00:15:38,040
right there there's things like to we
work on one product and we want to

267
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:38,769
resize

268
00:15:38,769 --> 00:15:42,810
all through holes so the data same drill
draw size

269
00:15:42,810 --> 00:15:46,089
usually don't have to play girls and
brands are we did a search our place and

270
00:15:46,089 --> 00:15:49,880
all the drawers are the same size

271
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:52,959
unlike with Gina

272
00:15:52,959 --> 00:15:56,540
do what simulation simulation yes
they're spy stores in g.a

273
00:15:56,540 --> 00:15:59,699
on I'm a about to get about are so

274
00:15:59,699 --> 00:16:02,810
because I'll text fathers version
control family the dish you get

275
00:16:02,810 --> 00:16:06,009
when you do a commit a product into the
system actually

276
00:16:06,009 --> 00:16:09,500
is just a death it's very
straightforward arm

277
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:12,410
and one the other nice things as they
are actually several scripts people have

278
00:16:12,410 --> 00:16:13,389
written for jitter

279
00:16:13,389 --> 00:16:17,180
that will build standard for Prince
forty very easily see consensus

280
00:16:17,180 --> 00:16:21,149
TQFP with this kinda pitch and its 32
pence

281
00:16:21,149 --> 00:16:25,100
America's pub and God get that for
partner Don

282
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:29,720
arm and a lot of other generators that
can do that kind stuff

283
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:35,029
our

284
00:16:35,029 --> 00:16:42,029
pop trance there's been some work
between I'm k cacti cat and

285
00:16:42,029 --> 00:16:46,000
jeeter to try to standardize between the
two of them debonair change

286
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,509
but that hasn't really taken off yet and
there has been resume re some

287
00:16:49,509 --> 00:16:54,740
work now that the eagle has switched
their file format to an XML format

288
00:16:54,740 --> 00:16:57,910
on people are currently trying numbers
are actually a lot more work on a hike

289
00:16:57,910 --> 00:16:58,969
at community

290
00:16:58,970 --> 00:17:02,100
to port bad and I imagine once that's
done

291
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:05,630
GA can just take that code and then
important legal X now

292
00:17:05,630 --> 00:17:10,640
blobs %uh there are some file formats
that are very interchangeable the G can

293
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:11,179
work with

294
00:17:11,179 --> 00:17:15,360
a the standard the governor from at the
IRS

295
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:18,470
247 I Karen exact name

296
00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:21,870
his it its viewers can open those files
very easily

297
00:17:21,870 --> 00:17:25,240
and a the similar bad formats that

298
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:28,240
different things can open each other up

299
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:32,490
%uh one thing that's nice budgets it's
actually a very old project

300
00:17:32,490 --> 00:17:37,340
a its so 1998 as was its first public
release

301
00:17:37,340 --> 00:17:41,490
and a its it doesn't have lots of new
features

302
00:17:41,490 --> 00:17:45,110
a the the most crazy new feature that I
I know that happen

303
00:17:45,110 --> 00:17:48,559
fairly recently was they added support
for there's a

304
00:17:48,559 --> 00:17:53,629
the a preview for mad so that you can
see what your PCB will look like

305
00:17:53,630 --> 00:17:58,270
and they added in making it show that
the solder mask in different colors

306
00:17:58,270 --> 00:18:01,280
that was a big update so there's not

307
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:05,139
it not dead it's just everything you
really need it done

308
00:18:05,140 --> 00:18:08,789
there are some pretty features the
people are stuck on working on Mike 3d

309
00:18:08,789 --> 00:18:10,570
OpenGL

310
00:18:10,570 --> 00:18:14,200
out but they can look but it's gonna
like physically fit and the bat

311
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:17,510
you don't really need that the justices
pretty

312
00:18:17,510 --> 00:18:20,590
um and and and Tom at this depth

313
00:18:20,590 --> 00:18:23,809
so they're jet actually bioscience
several different program so there's

314
00:18:23,809 --> 00:18:26,690
spice wave an ass a spare logs simulator

315
00:18:26,690 --> 00:18:30,410
like term at Annex structural analysis
the

316
00:18:30,410 --> 00:18:34,410
as guy reviewing is just under different
small programs in this whole suite of

317
00:18:34,410 --> 00:18:35,340
tools

318
00:18:35,340 --> 00:18:41,110
and so you really can do just about
anything it with it and hardware and

319
00:18:41,110 --> 00:18:45,750
the the community on mailing lists and
the IRC channel our people hang out with

320
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:48,880
the had they've done a lot of the stuff
so they can help you out

321
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:52,110
and in using these tools and getting
what you need done

322
00:18:52,110 --> 00:18:56,700
on seen some very mature projects come
out you know very

323
00:18:56,700 --> 00:19:00,700
professional problems come out others
not just obvious right

324
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:04,940
on and so the

325
00:19:04,940 --> 00:19:08,350
now you decide to use data and awesome

326
00:19:08,350 --> 00:19:12,110
younger where to go where near the start

327
00:19:12,110 --> 00:19:16,020
you know keep movin slides yeah I'm aka
so

328
00:19:16,020 --> 00:19:19,679
first up is having idea I am and that's
kinda have

329
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:23,480
you're gonna have some you want to build
some projects and prom you want to solve

330
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:26,690
arm whether it's something that's going
to

331
00:19:26,690 --> 00:19:30,179
a spy on a spy bus for you for

332
00:19:30,179 --> 00:19:34,669
for your own learning free on projects
or whether you want to

333
00:19:34,669 --> 00:19:38,260
a in the have an end product that does
something on

334
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:41,340
oren in one of our cases a a

335
00:19:41,340 --> 00:19:44,709
learning kit you know there these are
things that you could do

336
00:19:44,710 --> 00:19:48,370
I do this so you have some idea and I
really fine it's great to

337
00:19:48,370 --> 00:19:52,039
look at it you know don't don't worry
about reinventing the wheel

338
00:19:52,039 --> 00:19:55,840
if you if you don't if you're not the
electronics a guru

339
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:58,480
you know you can look at what other
people are doing take the time to learn

340
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:00,150
those things first

341
00:20:00,150 --> 00:20:03,650
arm you know the if if you don't know

342
00:20:03,650 --> 00:20:06,970
a resistor works there's only so much
this kind the programs can help you with

343
00:20:06,970 --> 00:20:07,539
you know

344
00:20:07,539 --> 00:20:11,640
you print so but you can go to other
people you build small teams you can

345
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:13,450
work together with stuff

346
00:20:13,450 --> 00:20:17,770
I am and you start to build a prototype
you find some that actually works

347
00:20:17,770 --> 00:20:21,010
and when you put it on a breadboard arm

348
00:20:21,010 --> 00:20:24,900
stick with the wires and get something
that's gonna work in and so now you've

349
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:28,690
you've built this prototype you've got
this thing that works it kinda

350
00:20:28,690 --> 00:20:32,750
it blinks the way you want it to or does
the thing you wanted to do you've done

351
00:20:32,750 --> 00:20:33,539
this

352
00:20:33,539 --> 00:20:37,470
a it really hands on kinda prototyping
is great way to start

353
00:20:37,470 --> 00:20:41,070
on and this is something that fitting as
well go back to this is sorted their

354
00:20:41,070 --> 00:20:41,870
level

355
00:20:41,870 --> 00:20:45,179
where they started at least are running
into all that you can do all that

356
00:20:45,179 --> 00:20:49,370
in the interior and software and then

357
00:20:49,370 --> 00:20:53,130
you once you get that working are you
gonna build a schematic

358
00:20:53,130 --> 00:20:57,730
om and that's going to to a tell you
exactly

359
00:20:57,730 --> 00:21:01,120
where the where the connections are made
what's actually going on

360
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:04,419
what components you're using I I've

361
00:21:04,419 --> 00:21:08,030
I've I do understand all this but I've
left a lot of that work to

362
00:21:08,030 --> 00:21:11,510
to mark so he feels like he's doing
something I

363
00:21:11,510 --> 00:21:14,740
that the really important things about
the schematic is

364
00:21:14,740 --> 00:21:18,350
a so every step in hardware every time
you fail

365
00:21:18,350 --> 00:21:22,590
a causing a time in the mean time
between failures

366
00:21:22,590 --> 00:21:26,850
can be weeks and at least for me I come
from software

367
00:21:26,850 --> 00:21:30,669
I'm much more happy with minutes I like
thanks to fail early and often

368
00:21:30,669 --> 00:21:34,409
and then I can move on to pick some and
so with this command: X

369
00:21:34,409 --> 00:21:37,929
I prime are most helpful for is is
making sure

370
00:21:37,929 --> 00:21:41,010
that you've got all your cheese and
crossed I rise

371
00:21:41,010 --> 00:21:46,010
so that every thang is correct way if
you wait until the the PCB design stage

372
00:21:46,010 --> 00:21:46,590
that

373
00:21:46,590 --> 00:21:49,959
for that kind of trouble shooting you
have nothing but headaches cuz then

374
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:51,870
you've gotta move whole components
around

375
00:21:51,870 --> 00:21:55,500
reroute racist signs a and so when you
do this mag you go through every data

376
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:56,049
sheet

377
00:21:56,049 --> 00:21:59,629
check all the snacks make sure
everything is within spec and then

378
00:21:59,630 --> 00:22:04,049
on once you've completed this a the next
step is now going to PTA

379
00:22:04,049 --> 00:22:08,150
right then you're going to actually
create a physical path for everything

380
00:22:08,150 --> 00:22:11,280
om everything has to have a layup wide
but

381
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:14,299
the nice thing is the step between
schematic and PCB

382
00:22:14,299 --> 00:22:17,500
a the script and Gina then takes his

383
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:20,809
takes your your schematic and build you
a

384
00:22:20,809 --> 00:22:25,070
a very good netlist that shows you all
well the connection should be

385
00:22:25,070 --> 00:22:29,158
com and and how they should be you can
marked race is being powered traces are

386
00:22:29,159 --> 00:22:30,120
signal traces

387
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:33,919
and southern some I am Kevin Brown the
and is almost

388
00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:37,150
I will say as a hobby it's almost funded
that you can sit there

389
00:22:37,150 --> 00:22:41,000
and you work with the netlist and you
see all the connections in PCB

390
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:44,850
that you're supposed to make and they're
just logical and then you start filling

391
00:22:44,850 --> 00:22:45,890
those in

392
00:22:45,890 --> 00:22:49,179
in the program and and you you you have
a sedative

393
00:22:49,179 --> 00:22:53,669
love the call rats on those are the
logical connections

394
00:22:53,669 --> 00:22:56,809
and you work to these rats and took them
away

395
00:22:56,809 --> 00:23:00,120
you know and I get to tell hamas like
I've only got ten rounds left I'm only

396
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:01,970
got five rats left you know

397
00:23:01,970 --> 00:23:05,740
and the unfortunate thing is as the rats
become lest they trample exponentially

398
00:23:05,740 --> 00:23:07,520
harder surrounding had to run

399
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:11,770
so each morning one more dead as a
glorious moments lows last one or two

400
00:23:11,770 --> 00:23:12,510
and then

401
00:23:12,510 --> 00:23:15,600
you got a backup sounds like like but
your

402
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:18,679
I've got 10 left W had two yesterday
yeah right but

403
00:23:18,679 --> 00:23:22,140
a hug but but you the the process

404
00:23:22,140 --> 00:23:26,580
making sure everything isn't overlapping
the you have the tolerances

405
00:23:26,580 --> 00:23:30,280
you're still looking back at your data
sheets for what you can and can't do

406
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:33,340
you have some components that say you
know you can't

407
00:23:33,340 --> 00:23:36,928
throw any signal line underneath my
package

408
00:23:36,929 --> 00:23:40,470
you know where I'm going to destroy it
so you look for those things in your

409
00:23:40,470 --> 00:23:43,390
saying from a physical level how's
everything going to fit together in

410
00:23:43,390 --> 00:23:46,650
and where's where's electrically
connected

411
00:23:46,650 --> 00:23:51,460
um and if you're not a perfectionist and
you can trust your computer

412
00:23:51,460 --> 00:23:55,220
I might am you can there actually are
adding tools and Angelina

413
00:23:55,220 --> 00:23:58,710
and you can use the DRC definitions to
help you

414
00:23:58,710 --> 00:24:01,809
route these traces without having to be
a

415
00:24:01,809 --> 00:24:05,399
do it myself yes I'll admit there's and

416
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:08,659
the the on a routing ability

417
00:24:08,659 --> 00:24:12,179
love GA to is very reasonable

418
00:24:12,179 --> 00:24:15,470
I'll put it that way um if you doing
something small

419
00:24:15,470 --> 00:24:18,909
definitely just click the button you
done your day arm

420
00:24:18,909 --> 00:24:22,929
their times I'm on I'm gonna be honest I
I don't understand why it routed

421
00:24:22,929 --> 00:24:24,750
something over here

422
00:24:24,750 --> 00:24:28,720
and I'm back in border like 8v is extra
layers yeah six-letter

423
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:32,860
out but but there are still and that
some love that some others on us

424
00:24:32,860 --> 00:24:36,090
learning the tool because there are
still

425
00:24:36,090 --> 00:24:39,730
options with Angie to to set to tell it
you know well that's only this many

426
00:24:39,730 --> 00:24:42,740
layers well I want to use the style
routing you know

427
00:24:42,740 --> 00:24:47,190
read the other routers is very friendly
Tom if he pleaded the IDRC rules and you

428
00:24:47,190 --> 00:24:49,020
feed it how many layers you want

429
00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:53,168
and you can even slight just a few of
the Nazi on route all the routes to some

430
00:24:53,169 --> 00:24:53,980
other ads

431
00:24:53,980 --> 00:24:57,710
and it will do all this for you in it
also includes a auto placement

432
00:24:57,710 --> 00:25:01,309
so it can move all the footprints around
for you to what it banks would make no

433
00:25:01,309 --> 00:25:02,330
sense logically

434
00:25:02,330 --> 00:25:06,029
yet so if you have an LED catch it to a
resistor its going to move Delhi in the

435
00:25:06,029 --> 00:25:07,370
resistor too close together

436
00:25:07,370 --> 00:25:10,730
of an erection arm

437
00:25:10,730 --> 00:25:15,140
save you've built aboard and and you've
you've designed it

438
00:25:15,140 --> 00:25:19,270
you can do all the little finishing work
the and I've got your board

439
00:25:19,270 --> 00:25:23,570
example the out but we're talking about
when you can do a simulated

440
00:25:23,570 --> 00:25:27,678
thats print over the board so it's kinda
pretty

441
00:25:27,679 --> 00:25:30,770
yep but but that narrowly real now

442
00:25:30,770 --> 00:25:35,000
there's a lot more to do after his point
to go to an actual product to something

443
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,029
you've done

444
00:25:36,029 --> 00:25:40,220
um and thats sourcing components so even
if you've already gone through the

445
00:25:40,220 --> 00:25:43,350
process we started to pick out you know
I'm gonna use

446
00:25:43,350 --> 00:25:46,659
you know a 555 timer nominees a 40-17
counter

447
00:25:46,659 --> 00:25:49,740
we still will okay work may actually buy

448
00:25:49,740 --> 00:25:54,059
100 those right now union today to where
we're gonna bows and what's the cheapest

449
00:25:54,059 --> 00:25:55,330
price I can get

450
00:25:55,330 --> 00:25:58,918
and you know so you wanna a hundred a
bum

451
00:25:58,919 --> 00:26:02,169
sometimes you have to look a little bit
right arm

452
00:26:02,169 --> 00:26:05,210
but there are there this great places
Mouser digikey

453
00:26:05,210 --> 00:26:08,860
element14 there's there's a lot of
little electronics designs

454
00:26:08,860 --> 00:26:11,870
a elektrax component shops out there

455
00:26:11,870 --> 00:26:15,890
on on the Internet and they're all very
good about when you search time you can

456
00:26:15,890 --> 00:26:19,730
see how much parts are going to cost and
what quantities in what quantities they

457
00:26:19,730 --> 00:26:21,059
break in price

458
00:26:21,059 --> 00:26:24,178
so red one on this project we bought our

459
00:26:24,179 --> 00:26:27,490
we needed 8,000 10k resistors I

460
00:26:27,490 --> 00:26:31,260
but it was actually half the price to
buy 10,000 of them instead

461
00:26:31,260 --> 00:26:35,059
and sorry have 2010 k resistors line
around

462
00:26:35,059 --> 00:26:38,399
yes um another good place to third

463
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:41,820
a there's a a surgeon cocktail party

464
00:26:41,820 --> 00:26:45,480
on and it's really cool because it
surges digikey Mouser

465
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:49,250
and others and it will comparison price
them

466
00:26:49,250 --> 00:26:52,720
but usually the one cut down server is
it doesn't really compare surprising

467
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:53,549
quantities

468
00:26:53,549 --> 00:26:57,309
so bright you looking for a one of its
it's very nice to just see where is this

469
00:26:57,309 --> 00:26:57,809
one

470
00:26:57,809 --> 00:27:02,080
the cheapest and also it'll tell you if
it's in stock to suicide doctor part as

471
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:04,070
well it's not a bad place look for

472
00:27:04,070 --> 00:27:08,570
the Dutch the datasheets for for pride
you know if you know already

473
00:27:08,570 --> 00:27:13,289
the if you know really which chip it is
you have sitting there

474
00:27:13,289 --> 00:27:16,779
you can count a bonanza it's a search
engine designed for the electronics

475
00:27:16,779 --> 00:27:17,150
world

476
00:27:17,150 --> 00:27:21,820
some and even they're crazy Chinese
people out there

477
00:27:21,820 --> 00:27:27,939
we want to sell you LED's that they
found off the back of a truck

478
00:27:27,940 --> 00:27:31,340
in millions a quality good

479
00:27:31,340 --> 00:27:34,360
um so then finding aboard house

480
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:37,559
um there are some great options out
there too

481
00:27:37,559 --> 00:27:40,908
to the the birdhouses was printing PCB
for you

482
00:27:40,909 --> 00:27:44,360
arm assuming that you are gonna catch
one for yourself

483
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:47,590
they don't catch Barnes are so cheap

484
00:27:47,590 --> 00:27:51,179
it big they're cheap in getting cheaper
to am

485
00:27:51,179 --> 00:27:55,149
there are some that we have used in
Tower France have used a in particular

486
00:27:55,149 --> 00:27:55,559
it

487
00:27:55,559 --> 00:27:58,760
we've had really good luck with seed in
the past arm with

488
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:02,110
ordered several different boards from
mom common they come fairly quickly I

489
00:28:02,110 --> 00:28:02,779
think

490
00:28:02,779 --> 00:28:06,880
the slowest time we had with succeed was
about a month

491
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:11,870
and the fast this was probably two weeks
they do kinda batch processing and so

492
00:28:11,870 --> 00:28:12,820
does drug Bob

493
00:28:12,820 --> 00:28:15,850
am the reason we found a

494
00:28:15,850 --> 00:28:19,270
this one guy a there's a third his
website

495
00:28:19,270 --> 00:28:24,070
contact vanna a dot were gonna say a
dotnet

496
00:28:24,070 --> 00:28:27,428
but he actually doesn't have really
anything up there I met him on our

497
00:28:27,429 --> 00:28:32,750
the freenode he was like yeah I live in
China and I can make you PCB's

498
00:28:32,750 --> 00:28:37,730
as I really like the sound of that and
he gave me a good quote

499
00:28:37,730 --> 00:28:40,909
and a we got our PCB's from him

500
00:28:40,909 --> 00:28:44,610
and made a turnaround time was one week
they were fairly cheap

501
00:28:44,610 --> 00:28:49,620
a he hasn't kinda sketchy problems and
that the

502
00:28:49,620 --> 00:28:53,539
he doesn't have the RC rules he says the

503
00:28:53,539 --> 00:28:56,908
warriors the DRC is the the tolerances
between

504
00:28:56,909 --> 00:29:01,120
your what how look smaller line you can
bill HealthSmart raise

505
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:04,899
how our partner Kimberly in B that kinda
thing Tom

506
00:29:04,899 --> 00:29:09,590
glad I'm attack on but I get his like
the mix of arms so

507
00:29:09,590 --> 00:29:12,690
really really tiny don't worry about it
and I

508
00:29:12,690 --> 00:29:17,080
if it fails small guilty for free don't
worry about it

509
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:20,370
so I'm did we mention that he met among
ir c yeah he was

510
00:29:20,370 --> 00:29:23,520
you just in power PCB was like hey here
make imports

511
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:27,668
nothing yeah but I would urge strongly
recommend Nebr

512
00:29:27,669 --> 00:29:32,970
find 'em dams and doesn't resolve this
from it works

513
00:29:32,970 --> 00:29:36,500
and then finally a the latter as yet

514
00:29:36,500 --> 00:29:40,390
chain and a table you and then

515
00:29:40,390 --> 00:29:43,880
nope an express kim's Abboud make up
your home

516
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:48,440
doing hard labor and they are this is a
a sorting

517
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:51,750
tons a PNP and NPN Rizana

518
00:29:51,750 --> 00:29:56,399
transistors right now yeah and it's
really boring

519
00:29:56,399 --> 00:30:00,419
watch a movie answer back package

520
00:30:00,419 --> 00:30:04,529
and mana as the final assembly and doing
on getting word now

521
00:30:04,529 --> 00:30:07,580
packages and the you can see wanna

522
00:30:07,580 --> 00:30:11,418
our recent projects here and they're
they're wrapped like me

523
00:30:11,419 --> 00:30:15,010
that that was the did the idea so we had
to shrink wrap that but we didn't have

524
00:30:15,010 --> 00:30:16,779
machines to do this we're

525
00:30:16,779 --> 00:30:20,809
just starting out Stanley and we didn't
know that the the proper way to do it

526
00:30:20,809 --> 00:30:24,460
until right after we finished a a friend
of ours

527
00:30:24,460 --> 00:30:28,020
used to work a superb a meat market and
he was like oh yeah it's really easy

528
00:30:28,020 --> 00:30:30,440
just me know ha coat hanger and the
sideband

529
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:35,299
thats dizzy and takes like 10 seconds to
do one and we were like

530
00:30:35,299 --> 00:30:38,379
0 my dad's been days

531
00:30:38,380 --> 00:30:43,200
with a heat gun it was very upsetting

532
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:48,250
and so then max you

533
00:30:48,250 --> 00:30:53,600
climb fingerprint and then prop so yeah
Big Bang invigorated your project it

534
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:55,580
solves your task it its

535
00:30:55,580 --> 00:30:59,080
a benefit to the world in this case its

536
00:30:59,080 --> 00:31:02,750
the other side so so we must within
actually touch on this

537
00:31:02,750 --> 00:31:06,659
this particular project I'll came out
over an idea

538
00:31:06,659 --> 00:31:10,799
up wanting to teach soldering and to say
and I'll

539
00:31:10,799 --> 00:31:14,000
I want a kid to teach soldering I want
them to actually

540
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:17,850
have produced something when it's
finished and done more than three

541
00:31:17,850 --> 00:31:19,070
connections

542
00:31:19,070 --> 00:31:22,129
you know so so there's some
substantially sit down with

543
00:31:22,130 --> 00:31:25,610
and something you can that does
something when you're done and that sort

544
00:31:25,610 --> 00:31:27,169
of a tank cover design its

545
00:31:27,169 --> 00:31:30,490
you don't have to worry about what goes
into at night scene

546
00:31:30,490 --> 00:31:34,220
a couple projects like the electronic
days it's a it's a fun little

547
00:31:34,220 --> 00:31:36,659
engineering problem when you're starting
out

548
00:31:36,659 --> 00:31:40,500
so I got advice from other people about
how to build these kinda tweeted to

549
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:43,830
I wanted to do and how I wanted to
behave om

550
00:31:43,830 --> 00:31:47,408
and and that's how this design came
about om

551
00:31:47,409 --> 00:31:51,549
and and then the other nice I love it is
that

552
00:31:51,549 --> 00:31:56,570
um that that Michael I love it was that
provide a very good example

553
00:31:56,570 --> 00:32:00,678
I love appalled output have all these
tools and sorry

554
00:32:00,679 --> 00:32:03,950
we also publish all the comets its open
hardware or

555
00:32:03,950 --> 00:32:07,899
free hardware as I would call it arm all
the schematics

556
00:32:07,899 --> 00:32:11,630
gerber's a footprints the PCB layout

557
00:32:11,630 --> 00:32:16,409
make file we used to to go through and
automate this whole process

558
00:32:16,409 --> 00:32:19,730
every little bit of it it is out there
Anna and I'll admit

559
00:32:19,730 --> 00:32:24,140
before starting somebody's project that
we've been working on

560
00:32:24,140 --> 00:32:27,630
not just this one I had used Eagle
before needles really easy is for

561
00:32:27,630 --> 00:32:28,880
hobbies that was great

562
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:32,940
anne's like you know that lets you
something open open source like our

563
00:32:32,940 --> 00:32:36,620
freedom and and i'd it I'm not gonna lie
was

564
00:32:36,620 --> 00:32:40,269
it was hard to learn some other stuff
going into jere but

565
00:32:40,269 --> 00:32:43,440
now that I know it all for I don't say
no it all

566
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:47,610
another know how to use judgment um 22
finisher product I'm so much happier

567
00:32:47,610 --> 00:32:49,110
than when I get done

568
00:32:49,110 --> 00:32:52,380
you know in that same kinda anal you did
everything yourself way

569
00:32:52,380 --> 00:32:55,590
you know I'm not worried about footprint
generators and stuff like that I'm going

570
00:32:55,590 --> 00:32:57,399
to build the footprint myself I'm gonna

571
00:32:57,399 --> 00:33:02,090
finishes matter Hyuna IOM and it gives
you those tools and gives you that

572
00:33:02,090 --> 00:33:06,840
that really would you say it like a a
romantic candle Asia burning them are

573
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:10,809
e-maxx and their yes very high a lot her
hand at first

574
00:33:10,809 --> 00:33:14,029
but then once you get into it it's it's
faster and much

575
00:33:14,029 --> 00:33:17,210
much quicker to get what you want done
yeah definitely

576
00:33:17,210 --> 00:33:22,409
on so so that's we we gotta finish
product at a button

577
00:33:22,409 --> 00:33:26,110
and we hope to do more yes arm

578
00:33:26,110 --> 00:33:30,419
and so a is pretty much well we have
some

579
00:33:30,419 --> 00:33:34,279
ironic him I had questions common
anything they want to know

580
00:33:34,279 --> 00:33:37,620
more about these different tools arm the

581
00:33:37,620 --> 00:33:41,700
the talk is available online at but that
web address dying down PDF

582
00:33:41,700 --> 00:33:46,409
for some reason right now 200 megabytes
and on our make it smaller at some point

583
00:33:46,409 --> 00:33:49,419
am and I got an email saying

584
00:33:49,419 --> 00:33:52,750
question about the tool chains are why
would they were deter-

585
00:33:52,750 --> 00:33:56,330
center I R

586
00:33:56,330 --> 00:34:01,019
great talk I he went through something
similar just recently

587
00:34:01,019 --> 00:34:04,330
in one of the things I haven't been able
to figure out years

588
00:34:04,330 --> 00:34:08,320
what impact skin-tight house when your
using Gina

589
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:13,520
its gotta have some kind of downstream
flow to PCB but I don't understand what

590
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:14,320
that is I mark

591
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:17,839
all of my plans as passive right now
right you can

592
00:34:17,839 --> 00:34:22,000
you can define your pen types and your
trace types are really a &&

593
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:25,369
minsk in the skin part at the sniper you
define arm

594
00:34:25,369 --> 00:34:28,570
different races so that when you are in
PCB

595
00:34:28,570 --> 00:34:31,770
it can be marked as it needs to be a
fatter tracer thinner trace

596
00:34:31,770 --> 00:34:35,329
for most projects that hobbyists would
be like like us

597
00:34:35,329 --> 00:34:39,540
were working a very small megahertz very
small power the standard level thickness

598
00:34:39,540 --> 00:34:41,989
a trace is going to be fine for anything
you're gonna do

599
00:34:41,990 --> 00:34:45,070
you don't really need differentiated so
like come on this board for example

600
00:34:45,070 --> 00:34:45,820
every trace

601
00:34:45,820 --> 00:34:48,919
we did as the just John normally badeah

602
00:34:48,918 --> 00:34:52,839
on whatever are kinda other goals with
with this board was that

603
00:34:52,839 --> 00:34:56,349
the board is designed so that it can be
chemically etched easily yeah

604
00:34:56,349 --> 00:35:01,079
we had my personal air to writes all one
larry i we never did any stables at that

605
00:35:01,079 --> 00:35:01,810
store

606
00:35:01,810 --> 00:35:05,190
needed any sponsored another layer would
be needed and so

607
00:35:05,190 --> 00:35:09,339
thats nifty but doubt that's that's the
the purpose of the pen times as you can

608
00:35:09,339 --> 00:35:09,990
define

609
00:35:09,990 --> 00:35:12,990
you can make it so that on the next up
on PCB you make sure you make a mistake

610
00:35:12,990 --> 00:35:13,720
by

611
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:17,150
a and a ride in like a radio signal

612
00:35:17,150 --> 00:35:20,540
throughway to them a trace or something
close to the power

613
00:35:20,540 --> 00:35:23,650
yen I think it's a great example where
on

614
00:35:23,650 --> 00:35:26,980
where PCB NG well gee there's a whole

615
00:35:26,980 --> 00:35:30,420
as a toolchain works really well
surprisingly well

616
00:35:30,420 --> 00:35:33,859
from enterprise mindset and so yet as a
hobbyist

617
00:35:33,859 --> 00:35:36,069
you don't really think about it that
much you're not worried about those

618
00:35:36,070 --> 00:35:37,349
tolerances but

619
00:35:37,349 --> 00:35:40,619
the tools are available to you one even
if you are you your

620
00:35:40,619 --> 00:35:43,950
your where your whole project but if you
were handing this ought to somebody else

621
00:35:43,950 --> 00:35:46,020
he might not realize that that part

622
00:35:46,020 --> 00:35:49,089
is doing dysfunction needs to have this
tolerance to work

623
00:35:49,089 --> 00:35:52,779
and so it's it's a wave just more
documentation your project

624
00:35:52,780 --> 00:35:56,460
on at the source file level you say that
pen is a power pen they

625
00:35:56,460 --> 00:36:00,070
they know they need something thicker
for trace going to it for

626
00:36:00,070 --> 00:36:03,390
you providing thanks them

627
00:36:03,390 --> 00:36:08,980
thank you okay I'm curious how much are
you paying for I get to buy three double

628
00:36:08,980 --> 00:36:09,690
sided

629
00:36:09,690 --> 00:36:13,560
bored with the selectors screens are
masked to by Teresa

630
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:16,779
the sport was having it was those thats

631
00:36:16,780 --> 00:36:20,859
3 both now 3.5 LX 3.5

632
00:36:20,859 --> 00:36:25,960
see at this this miss Bertha Republic
3.5 we ordered 100 of them had rush

633
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:26,869
shipping

634
00:36:26,869 --> 00:36:31,060
and it was i think one hundred and sixty
nine dollars

635
00:36:31,060 --> 00:36:35,549
a and 40 if that was the shipping and
Jenna its Danny wanted

636
00:36:35,550 --> 00:36:39,369
it's very cheap but I am the other nice
thing about the had been a guy is

637
00:36:39,369 --> 00:36:43,280
is he is a subpar the person as bird
house does mostly cell phones

638
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:46,849
and so they do to foreign 8 lehrer
boards I think azo

639
00:36:46,849 --> 00:36:50,160
it he doesn't care it said he needed
multilayer boarding

640
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:55,500
it's not any big deal to him yeah tad
muller's

641
00:36:55,500 --> 00:37:00,000
okay I am i holed about key kinda person
because I chip just

642
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:03,599
no chance for that and I I see no reason

643
00:37:03,599 --> 00:37:06,730
like I can see any reason why you know
you guys choose

644
00:37:06,730 --> 00:37:10,510
due to over $2 K because really easy to
use I use

645
00:37:10,510 --> 00:37:14,650
out him and you know like the XP before
when I was right with me and after that

646
00:37:14,650 --> 00:37:15,160
I

647
00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:19,000
her about me because I'm from China so
obviously appealing to the music while

648
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:22,140
right hours so I i heard about you know
and the

649
00:37:22,140 --> 00:37:26,430
Williams use and China most I I said
argument does not help him up and ask

650
00:37:26,430 --> 00:37:29,109
about that very prudent is called Patel

651
00:37:29,109 --> 00:37:32,700
Anna yeah okay and the oh well so

652
00:37:32,700 --> 00:37:35,849
I one really want to know because I
don't use get up before I

653
00:37:35,849 --> 00:37:40,220
I thought agree and I give up yeah
that's a common a

654
00:37:40,220 --> 00:37:43,220
term happened row they have heard yeah
but a be aware that

655
00:37:43,220 --> 00:37:46,800
I was a election ended a major so I
don't know

656
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:50,730
used well ima come pick a stock like a

657
00:37:50,730 --> 00:37:54,109
I think it's hot pad PDS ppl yes had

658
00:37:54,109 --> 00:37:57,839
or whatever so attendance your so anyway
others

659
00:37:57,839 --> 00:38:01,578
I want to read now that difference
between cuba and he can and while you

660
00:38:01,579 --> 00:38:02,200
guys choose

661
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:06,290
now did at you know why I'm we had dude
I can't do simulation but

662
00:38:06,290 --> 00:38:09,329
that's a function at the most people
don't use right now exactly don't even

663
00:38:09,329 --> 00:38:11,920
use right we don't use it as we don't
usually do analog

664
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:15,540
that is that temperamental that we want
to make sure that would work

665
00:38:15,540 --> 00:38:20,210
before we actually produce writer arm I
would say the biggest difference remain

666
00:38:20,210 --> 00:38:23,940
goin keep had is that

667
00:38:23,940 --> 00:38:27,700
I think gee to is is built much more are
several different projects

668
00:38:27,700 --> 00:38:31,320
risky cat everything's tied together so
like um

669
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:34,329
i've a schematic file four-part on

670
00:38:34,329 --> 00:38:38,240
are a symbol file for part and then
there's Cammack valleys the summer files

671
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:41,730
and those are just 10 gently linked to
the footprint files

672
00:38:41,730 --> 00:38:44,940
and sought easy to change each one of
these parts individually without

673
00:38:44,940 --> 00:38:46,270
affecting the others

674
00:38:46,270 --> 00:38:50,089
whereas most the stuff that I see in key
cat everything is kinda blunt

675
00:38:50,089 --> 00:38:53,420
together I'm not necessarily same one is
better than the other

676
00:38:53,420 --> 00:38:56,480
but I just preferred have each thang bit
small

677
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:59,660
own little better the world cuz for
example

678
00:38:59,660 --> 00:39:03,098
I know nothing about routing a I

679
00:39:03,099 --> 00:39:06,560
get very frustrated that I finish on
iTunes do and 10 has the last step in

680
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:07,500
the process

681
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:10,670
and I'm just 10 ish yeah route

682
00:39:10,670 --> 00:39:14,150
but the nice things I don't feel I need
to know any about because it's easy

683
00:39:14,150 --> 00:39:15,920
enough for us the segment this work

684
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:20,560
on and that way but there's nothing and
kik add to my knowledge did

685
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:24,650
you you can't do and junior vice versa

686
00:39:24,650 --> 00:39:28,780
except for maybe some other simulation
and Mike Verlag so the more

687
00:39:28,780 --> 00:39:32,270
features that are part of the core
Streeter said in some

688
00:39:32,270 --> 00:39:35,349
some of our decision to use due to over
key cad

689
00:39:35,349 --> 00:39:40,290
a was mostly personal yeah edward we're
not here to say the key kids actually

690
00:39:40,290 --> 00:39:42,829
bad program

691
00:39:42,829 --> 00:39:46,200
yes so I did says I want clarified that

692
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:49,560
does soul I I've been using he had 44
Yoan

693
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:53,390
its actually a you can totally separate
are the

694
00:39:53,390 --> 00:39:57,109
no I i'm where people can work different
I mean I

695
00:39:57,109 --> 00:39:59,930
apart from each other it just seems to
me that the majority people that are

696
00:39:59,930 --> 00:40:01,140
using Kik add

697
00:40:01,140 --> 00:40:04,810
use it in the same way that I see people
use Eagle and that day

698
00:40:04,810 --> 00:40:08,410
they have like the they have a problem
in there

699
00:40:08,410 --> 00:40:11,920
and the PCB they click on a footprint

700
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:15,619
and then they at the schematic and that
changes something in their other

701
00:40:15,619 --> 00:40:18,650
a in there design whereas

702
00:40:18,650 --> 00:40:21,910
when we haven't had a problem like that
I have to

703
00:40:21,910 --> 00:40:25,279
I go into the schematic I make the
changes and then

704
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:28,770
I per se update and I get a basically
idea

705
00:40:28,770 --> 00:40:32,390
that I can send to 10 and DEF can apply
it you can apply the death

706
00:40:32,390 --> 00:40:37,690
onto the PCB its own subsection away and
he can integrate those changes back n

707
00:40:37,690 --> 00:40:40,950
and I just feel like that's a better

708
00:40:40,950 --> 00:40:44,859
for integrity the project is a better
way to work and I think that workflow

709
00:40:44,859 --> 00:40:48,180
is more defined and Angie danna

710
00:40:48,180 --> 00:40:52,560
key code but I only really use kik ad
for a brief period before I decided I

711
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:52,990
liked

712
00:40:52,990 --> 00:40:57,109
due to better okay thanks

713
00:40:57,109 --> 00:41:00,348
wondering if you could elaborate a
little bit more on the difference

714
00:41:00,349 --> 00:41:01,109
between

715
00:41:01,109 --> 00:41:04,450
Jetta Virginia nom compared to some
thirty

716
00:41:04,450 --> 00:41:07,710
kind of industry standard the higher
level stuff you know

717
00:41:07,710 --> 00:41:11,940
where the shortcomings might be with
respect to high-speed designs are

718
00:41:11,940 --> 00:41:15,510
6 you know RF design stuff like that
something that I know if I wanted to

719
00:41:15,510 --> 00:41:17,490
kinda Monroe with the software

720
00:41:17,490 --> 00:41:20,960
into kinda more complicated designs
where might I hit the wall so

721
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:24,900
for stop I guess assuras others at the
very beginning to talk but 10 are not be

722
00:41:24,900 --> 00:41:26,890
ease or you busy P e's

723
00:41:26,890 --> 00:41:31,180
or even college graduates up

724
00:41:31,180 --> 00:41:34,770
so have to take this with tiny grants
automatic

725
00:41:34,770 --> 00:41:39,630
said %uh to my knowledge a PCB does not
have tools

726
00:41:39,630 --> 00:41:43,760
for on a routing traces based on
megahertz delay

727
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:48,170
and whatnot so it would be difficult to
do something like that NARM

728
00:41:48,170 --> 00:41:51,220
and Gina a but in saying that

729
00:41:51,220 --> 00:41:55,210
i've seen some people who are using G to
doing complicate things like that I'm

730
00:41:55,210 --> 00:41:57,869
not actually where how they're doing the
math to figure that out

731
00:41:57,869 --> 00:42:01,030
I'm sure to not just eyeballing and I
that's good

732
00:42:01,030 --> 00:42:05,050
you have not too bad I'm in

733
00:42:05,050 --> 00:42:08,890
bit right now I noticed was the bus
resembling but when you're trying to rob

734
00:42:08,890 --> 00:42:09,790
a signal

735
00:42:09,790 --> 00:42:14,430
%ah davit arrive at the same time based
on different megahertz box

736
00:42:14,430 --> 00:42:17,660
and yes you have to wind is a gram
rounding out because you're

737
00:42:17,660 --> 00:42:21,470
I'm your accounting for the speed the
electron through the path

738
00:42:21,470 --> 00:42:24,569
to my knowledge PCB doesn't have
something for that but

739
00:42:24,569 --> 00:42:27,839
I have doesn't have anything to make it
easy right to do it automatically like

740
00:42:27,839 --> 00:42:29,480
some to create those routers

741
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:33,359
yessir and and you haven't run into any
like a.m. multi-layered designs have you

742
00:42:33,359 --> 00:42:35,839
done any like for their designs with
jeeter

743
00:42:35,839 --> 00:42:40,150
we don't have played I've played with
four layer processes I haven't produced

744
00:42:40,150 --> 00:42:42,220
anything yet on a four-layer

745
00:42:42,220 --> 00:42:46,569
arm I think and i've seen are out
daughter out will make those decisions

746
00:42:46,569 --> 00:42:47,779
sometimes when you let it

747
00:42:47,780 --> 00:42:51,430
and that's images produced this 8 lehrer
monstrosity cos iClone

748
00:42:51,430 --> 00:42:54,799
well end it doesn't have a where limit
you can tell it to keep making more

749
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:55,680
layers he could

750
00:42:55,680 --> 00:42:58,710
with the Red Wings 64 layer processes
one

751
00:42:58,710 --> 00:43:02,849
house in layers board can be that big

752
00:43:02,849 --> 00:43:07,800
it can be great but I know that the that
would grant

753
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:11,079
idea by the yep that's the connotation
there

754
00:43:11,079 --> 00:43:16,190
waste more recently I've I've had
friends and family who do work

755
00:43:16,190 --> 00:43:19,520
arm in PD in board houses in

756
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:22,960
in engineering jobs for real on

757
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:26,920
that I do try to now say like hey look
at this new toy am playing with

758
00:43:26,920 --> 00:43:30,109
how does it compare in and I will get
some comments there

759
00:43:30,109 --> 00:43:33,060
it's either condescending are you know
yes that is a neat toy that you're

760
00:43:33,060 --> 00:43:33,819
working with

761
00:43:33,819 --> 00:43:36,980
but but they haven't come up with
anything that I can do in that they do

762
00:43:36,980 --> 00:43:38,040
in their

763
00:43:38,040 --> 00:43:42,400
bigger programs yeah Colfax the only
other big thing I would say is that some

764
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:45,290
of the other tools now are starting to
have these like footprint on-demand

765
00:43:45,290 --> 00:43:46,579
services

766
00:43:46,579 --> 00:43:50,010
and there's nothing like that and you
know there are

767
00:43:50,010 --> 00:43:54,089
a stores were people have put up there
for prints like my cars like we have all

768
00:43:54,089 --> 00:43:55,950
of our footprint on my name I could take
a min

769
00:43:55,950 --> 00:43:59,150
users they wanted but I am with the with
the anal

770
00:43:59,150 --> 00:44:02,369
right nobody writer Adelphi prostrate I
be other

771
00:44:02,369 --> 00:44:05,490
some instances worry at a ticket to TQFP

772
00:44:05,490 --> 00:44:08,780
yet but you know the paddling is
actually a little bit lighter ride

773
00:44:08,780 --> 00:44:09,300
writer

774
00:44:09,300 --> 00:44:12,650
what you want a little bit water because
you have the space for

775
00:44:12,650 --> 00:44:16,040
hands acrid um I've seen some people
route

776
00:44:16,040 --> 00:44:19,210
silk over pads as well as the clock you
too

777
00:44:19,210 --> 00:44:23,030
per new years experience in places that
were all

778
00:44:23,030 --> 00:44:27,000
actual amount the components for you
that cost mom that's actually like

779
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:31,119
really small you know mmm mediate that
that was the step about Channing

780
00:44:31,119 --> 00:44:31,839
Meanwood

781
00:44:31,839 --> 00:44:36,270
yep that's it the call may have to they
are you actually do things like

782
00:44:36,270 --> 00:44:41,640
my hand you can arm for certain pitch
with BJ's other people are

783
00:44:41,640 --> 00:44:45,460
operating them but on more realistically

784
00:44:45,460 --> 00:44:49,650
there are services that will do that
level manufacture assembly for you

785
00:44:49,650 --> 00:44:53,750
economy and we haven't had anything we
have assembled cuz I have time

786
00:44:53,750 --> 00:44:56,760
not but a 1

787
00:44:56,760 --> 00:45:00,359
that's a new service eat actually just
started offering on day will do

788
00:45:00,359 --> 00:45:03,910
assembly for you and they can give you a
quote are based on how many components

789
00:45:03,910 --> 00:45:08,480
and how difficult it is and they have
even gone as far as dole even sell it

790
00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:09,730
for you they're all just

791
00:45:09,730 --> 00:45:13,450
in another ship your product you can
ship drop ship directly from them they

792
00:45:13,450 --> 00:45:17,500
just use give them everythang and trust
that the see guys are awesome because

793
00:45:17,500 --> 00:45:18,200
they are

794
00:45:18,200 --> 00:45:23,819
but thanks number

795
00:45:23,819 --> 00:45:27,550
hi I used on did with the schematic

796
00:45:27,550 --> 00:45:31,349
have you would I'm you thought of you
not going to let see a higher level of

797
00:45:31,349 --> 00:45:35,250
abstraction like very lottery Sdn

798
00:45:35,250 --> 00:45:38,560
and if if so

799
00:45:38,560 --> 00:45:41,640
why don't you switch to their name is
going to I think me what you are doing

800
00:45:41,640 --> 00:45:43,270
is that you know you are

801
00:45:43,270 --> 00:45:47,589
coming up with a schematic and then you
you decide to order dispute compliments

802
00:45:47,589 --> 00:45:49,200
and then you

803
00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:52,480
been the PCB and then use order those
companies midnight

804
00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:56,760
so I'm just trying to understand rear if
you go to a higher level

805
00:45:56,760 --> 00:46:00,480
abstraction like Verilog how how we do
the whole no using G

806
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:03,730
you to so which either there's a a

807
00:46:03,730 --> 00:46:06,970
there is a path for for doing using
Verilog Azur

808
00:46:06,970 --> 00:46:10,460
your summer language a I haven't
personally used it because

809
00:46:10,460 --> 00:46:15,349
all the products we worked on our so
simplistic but I wouldn't even begin to

810
00:46:15,349 --> 00:46:16,099
think in

811
00:46:16,099 --> 00:46:19,240
that the have using Verilog to define
the relationships

812
00:46:19,240 --> 00:46:22,500
a microcontroller done yeah

813
00:46:22,500 --> 00:46:27,520
her a I know those tools I i agree with
him

814
00:46:27,520 --> 00:46:30,710
I know those tools are available I've
seen them in the chain and I've

815
00:46:30,710 --> 00:46:35,010
I've played with them one afternoon in
and I don't know what I needed them for

816
00:46:35,010 --> 00:46:38,250
right and at least personally I find

817
00:46:38,250 --> 00:46:41,490
for level complex they weave we've kind
of done on

818
00:46:41,490 --> 00:46:44,670
most of our products are a bit
microcontroller based a

819
00:46:44,670 --> 00:46:47,720
it's just easier to see where
everything's going on on on a cleanly

820
00:46:47,720 --> 00:46:49,010
made schematic

821
00:46:49,010 --> 00:46:53,050
them to you read through what the source
code and Verilog

822
00:46:53,050 --> 00:46:56,420
apologize we we haven't actually
experienced if you're talking about the

823
00:46:56,420 --> 00:46:58,640
Minerva not then you have died the
United right

824
00:46:58,640 --> 00:47:01,980
so you can use that in a wide by going
through all this pain oh

825
00:47:01,980 --> 00:47:05,109
while we were really bothered making
this an analog instead of just putting

826
00:47:05,109 --> 00:47:07,200
down this one are dwayne oh yeah

827
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:10,560
that that that conversation came up
building this kid

828
00:47:10,560 --> 00:47:14,380
I but this is all this is all passive
components

829
00:47:14,380 --> 00:47:18,339
because I don't a at in like I knew we
were packaging this ourselves I don't

830
00:47:18,339 --> 00:47:19,770
wanna go through the president

831
00:47:19,770 --> 00:47:23,089
programming every microcontroller we
sent out in

832
00:47:23,089 --> 00:47:26,308
making sure it would work and then when
you ship it make sure that when they

833
00:47:26,309 --> 00:47:28,599
soldered together it's going to work its

834
00:47:28,599 --> 00:47:32,140
DNR components were just so much easier
and I've I feel

835
00:47:32,140 --> 00:47:35,650
that this is going to be a tank you know
there's little you could do to break it

836
00:47:35,650 --> 00:47:36,480
really

837
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:40,559
and elbow I disagree with 10 it first
this is a dollar in 54 cents cheaper

838
00:47:40,559 --> 00:47:41,750
because it uses

839
00:47:41,750 --> 00:47:45,130
missus Bernard when a or I'm not
remember any ATMega

840
00:47:45,130 --> 00:47:48,180
but but you're right the we talk about
building

841
00:47:48,180 --> 00:47:52,970
migrant road projects arm why not just
use earned we know we're we're not just

842
00:47:52,970 --> 00:47:54,569
talking about

843
00:47:54,569 --> 00:47:59,650
the of a fun little robot on your desk
or a blinking LED

844
00:47:59,650 --> 00:48:03,190
are doing is great you can do
prototyping with an Arduino

845
00:48:03,190 --> 00:48:07,079
arm we're trying to get stuff that
smaller stuff that does other things

846
00:48:07,079 --> 00:48:10,750
more more purposeful products that do a

847
00:48:10,750 --> 00:48:14,780
age thing and it's great that they're
microcontroller we hope to open that up

848
00:48:14,780 --> 00:48:16,650
to you because it's open source

849
00:48:16,650 --> 00:48:20,040
but but we're not looking to build the
next word we know the ground they are

850
00:48:20,040 --> 00:48:21,150
doing is a great product

851
00:48:21,150 --> 00:48:24,329
right we probably use they are going on
and the majority of our prototyping

852
00:48:24,329 --> 00:48:27,829
to begin with because it's such a nice
those who what are some of the projects

853
00:48:27,829 --> 00:48:29,059
that you have done you know

854
00:48:29,059 --> 00:48:32,540
like applications that a should

855
00:48:32,540 --> 00:48:35,900
so we don't like to talk about
unreleased products

856
00:48:35,900 --> 00:48:39,359
yet but since you asked so nicely a

857
00:48:39,359 --> 00:48:42,589
we've been working %ah off and on for
about two years now

858
00:48:42,589 --> 00:48:45,880
on a on implementation ever

859
00:48:45,880 --> 00:48:49,740
two-factor authentication token a cock
daresay

860
00:48:49,740 --> 00:48:52,950
Mike there's a token be fine um

861
00:48:52,950 --> 00:48:56,280
but we've had some issues with the
battery life that's one other

862
00:48:56,280 --> 00:48:59,809
problems where we have we're not EE
we're not a police have been nice if we

863
00:48:59,809 --> 00:49:00,869
were

864
00:49:00,869 --> 00:49:04,119
cousins would have taken two years and
probably take two months your

865
00:49:04,119 --> 00:49:08,140
a we worked on a an alarm clock

866
00:49:08,140 --> 00:49:11,940
that messes with you intentionally so
you set the alarm for 730

867
00:49:11,940 --> 00:49:15,690
and then around 7:20 the clock starts to
elicit odd behavior

868
00:49:15,690 --> 00:49:18,740
several different ones like for example
can

869
00:49:18,740 --> 00:49:23,359
pretend it's daylight savings time an
known this diagram and hacks

870
00:49:23,359 --> 00:49:26,589
hard time dress by 30 minutes or

871
00:49:26,589 --> 00:49:29,808
several other things on that's kinda
funny one if

872
00:49:29,809 --> 00:49:33,700
in if you're wondering why is is I know
at least myself and a couple others

873
00:49:33,700 --> 00:49:37,329
it's easy to trust your alarm clock and
I got five more minutes than this

874
00:49:37,329 --> 00:49:40,910
this was we size a solution the sayings
like well you can't trust this clock

875
00:49:40,910 --> 00:49:44,690
you don't know what's going on right you
gotta get out

876
00:49:44,690 --> 00:49:48,480
a and we've also we build a a a reflow
oven controller

877
00:49:48,480 --> 00:49:51,819
so that 10 doesn't have to solder
everything by hand

878
00:49:51,819 --> 00:49:55,300
for our when working on that for a while
but don't quite have a Finnish design

879
00:49:55,300 --> 00:49:55,809
yet

880
00:49:55,809 --> 00:50:01,339
now but fun stuff

881
00:50:01,339 --> 00:50:05,619
me want to buy it give you the money

882
00:50:05,619 --> 00:50:09,300
lot 7 ago you know you wanna

883
00:50:09,300 --> 00:50:12,540
meet stand-up com damaged and a common
is our website

884
00:50:12,540 --> 00:50:18,119
a and if you go to the website other
sources under this Fossil repo

885
00:50:18,119 --> 00:50:21,520
and a its license and gplv3

886
00:50:21,520 --> 00:50:24,559
oliver hardware so far the most that way

887
00:50:24,559 --> 00:50:28,309
because I'm a free tired

888
00:50:28,309 --> 00:50:32,079
don't said

889
00:50:32,079 --> 00:50:37,819
our essay on discrete companies like no
no Rs 87 is actually burn all handmade

890
00:50:37,819 --> 00:50:42,240
328 microcontroller project 30 it's a
sever product that will be done is not

891
00:50:42,240 --> 00:50:44,079
make a 32.8% as the brain

892
00:50:44,079 --> 00:50:49,200
and a a just 232 killers clock to
provide clock

893
00:50:49,200 --> 00:50:53,069
and an OLEDB screen for the the display

894
00:50:53,069 --> 00:50:56,230
on given the complexity of the IRS

895
00:50:56,230 --> 00:50:59,550
that I what is the speed you know it's
actually

896
00:50:59,550 --> 00:51:02,760
pretty instantaneous arm we use theirs

897
00:51:02,760 --> 00:51:06,559
I I didn't realize I started working on
a project but there's a an RC I wish I

898
00:51:06,559 --> 00:51:06,960
could

899
00:51:06,960 --> 00:51:10,380
remember the number of time I had that
defines away

900
00:51:10,380 --> 00:51:14,140
abusing a shower one arms you have a
secure you have a secret

901
00:51:14,140 --> 00:51:18,200
on your token any taken it you take the
time and that secret

902
00:51:18,200 --> 00:51:22,640
and you shot once on it and a new run
FNB hash to get a very

903
00:51:22,640 --> 00:51:26,098
small like a 20 bit edgy 20 bit a number

904
00:51:26,099 --> 00:51:29,640
an ass played as a six digit number to
the user and you're doing the same thing

905
00:51:29,640 --> 00:51:30,490
on the server

906
00:51:30,490 --> 00:51:35,109
and you just compare those two numbers
and there are quick to libraries for the

907
00:51:35,109 --> 00:51:38,200
that mega system for doing this and it

908
00:51:38,200 --> 00:51:42,520
on 8 megahertz one it's instantaneous I
never even took the time to measured

909
00:51:42,520 --> 00:51:46,089
arm and then you go back to sleep order
then it's not our a/c

910
00:51:46,089 --> 00:51:49,290
no no it's not it's not I say
exclusively its

911
00:51:49,290 --> 00:51:52,779
but it demanded the same damn pictures
that what the product is

912
00:51:52,780 --> 00:51:55,960
and it's the same our system your Google
is using

913
00:51:55,960 --> 00:52:00,170
the shy one system and and their
two-factor authentication system

914
00:52:00,170 --> 00:52:03,640
I would say it's a equal security given
that in both

915
00:52:03,640 --> 00:52:07,799
and all the systems the only thing that
really is protecting you is your secret

916
00:52:07,800 --> 00:52:11,380
I A on it on the token in the in the
server

917
00:52:11,380 --> 00:52:15,040
and the algorithm I don't think shot one
has been

918
00:52:15,040 --> 00:52:18,400
are not some someone much %uh to be sex
has been in a

919
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:22,410
broken in such a way that it would make
it any less secure than our site open

920
00:52:22,410 --> 00:52:28,058
right

921
00:52:28,059 --> 00:52:31,180
right right the security yeah

922
00:52:31,180 --> 00:52:34,319
talkin but they don't

923
00:52:34,319 --> 00:52:37,490
to my knowledge they don't publish how
actually implement Diyala

924
00:52:37,490 --> 00:52:41,619
their their random know but it be a
Justice League

925
00:52:41,619 --> 00:52:45,730
rapid they lose million to talk and
somehow yet we we we heard that a girl

926
00:52:45,730 --> 00:52:46,660
eat then we went

927
00:52:46,660 --> 00:52:50,910
pp and then we heard the Google was
doing something like him

928
00:52:50,910 --> 00:52:53,980
right that won the event in the car our
system and

929
00:52:53,980 --> 00:52:57,660
and same thing goes actually doing is is
we want you to be able to keep your

930
00:52:57,660 --> 00:52:59,078
secret on both ends

931
00:52:59,079 --> 00:53:02,230
and right we don't want to hear from you
we want to know your device and

932
00:53:02,230 --> 00:53:05,990
you keep your secret secret and if you
lost it that hard

933
00:53:05,990 --> 00:53:09,599
by another one I in other your

934
00:53:09,599 --> 00:53:12,770
arm going back to G's Kim 'em

935
00:53:12,770 --> 00:53:16,680
is ur any utility in there to do bill
materials automatically

936
00:53:16,680 --> 00:53:20,059
but so you you can do it in jazz game
but the

937
00:53:20,059 --> 00:53:23,930
well I find a better place now is in PCB
PCB has a

938
00:53:23,930 --> 00:53:27,730
a to meet it was actually a it can
produce a bomb

939
00:53:27,730 --> 00:53:31,300
up and a volver you know that all the
parts you need

940
00:53:31,300 --> 00:53:34,790
and then also has a the bill you produce
an X&Y plot

941
00:53:34,790 --> 00:53:38,800
so a pick and place machine could place
all the the parts

942
00:53:38,800 --> 00:53:41,500
that's really handy because somebody
giver hackerspace a pick and place

943
00:53:41,500 --> 00:53:42,180
machine

944
00:53:42,180 --> 00:53:45,230
there you go these just assembly aboard
herself

945
00:53:45,230 --> 00:53:48,839
or simple our boards up

946
00:53:48,839 --> 00:53:52,890
were looking for a project to use their
custom months

947
00:53:52,890 --> 00:53:56,129
bacon i think thats Calgary hackerspace
yeah I think we're

948
00:53:56,130 --> 00:53:59,890
school as most overtime but any other
questions

949
00:53:59,890 --> 00:54:05,970
last question there by one map right now

950
00:54:05,970 --> 00:54:09,030
to make them very much school thank you
guys so much as a great talk
