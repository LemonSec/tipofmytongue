1
00:00:15,010 --> 00:00:18,940
touching on the first commercially
available modular robotic systems in the

2
00:00:18,940 --> 00:00:19,380
world

3
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:25,169
actually for adults it's the only one
there are a few other ones fun for kids

4
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:30,160
just love to see them so I don't have
those with me today

5
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:34,420
I guess to roll and there is another
system coming but

6
00:00:34,420 --> 00:00:38,810
is ready a for for I

7
00:00:38,810 --> 00:00:42,399
so my name is her for and I'm from
Sweden little

8
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:46,120
about might the time I talk to see their

9
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:49,769
and you pronounce my name like to
prepare your spot all

10
00:00:49,769 --> 00:00:52,870
and that might be good if you wanna talk
to me later during hope

11
00:00:52,870 --> 00:00:56,280
and I don't want to do that Picasa test
the Roberts out

12
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:59,489
I've got everything favor them just for
the whole

13
00:00:59,489 --> 00:01:02,600
two days remain I

14
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:05,930
we're talking about self reconfiguring
of

15
00:01:05,930 --> 00:01:11,190
and the name isn't very good

16
00:01:11,190 --> 00:01:14,570
called other things that other time like
program

17
00:01:14,570 --> 00:01:19,840
utility for you might have heard of Sep

18
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:22,920
what exactly has one thing going and

19
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:26,920
it describes well what it's all about a

20
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:31,259
start with modular in my robotics week
bill

21
00:01:31,259 --> 00:01:34,600
what we want from standardized rips
modules

22
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:38,149
and that's simply the Madras the better

23
00:01:38,149 --> 00:01:42,890
because it's more generally a pliable
can be used in more situations

24
00:01:42,890 --> 00:01:46,070
so young then versus custom we go

25
00:01:46,070 --> 00:01:50,030
general way and then reassemble what we
need from and

26
00:01:50,030 --> 00:01:54,659
this week and compass in there and solar
a model only includes

27
00:01:54,659 --> 00:01:59,180
enough functionality to contribute this
functionality decide

28
00:01:59,180 --> 00:02:02,750
in the insol that's why the see here

29
00:02:02,750 --> 00:02:07,119
that house G degrees of freedom and it's
a very very capable mod

30
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:10,380
most only have well I because that's the

31
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:14,090
smallest number you can have %uh

32
00:02:14,090 --> 00:02:18,550
and you see the the lose LEGO pieces of
course

33
00:02:18,550 --> 00:02:22,760
that the one that fits them and song
axiom best

34
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:26,190
because you could build the other two
from from the rock and

35
00:02:26,190 --> 00:02:29,579
shows actually quite clearly that's
actually what they've done

36
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:33,230
the bill looked at the LEGO pieces from
from LEGO pieces

37
00:02:33,230 --> 00:02:37,130
and you can of course use small one
startling

38
00:02:37,130 --> 00:02:40,170
pieces to build a woman them if you
wanted

39
00:02:40,170 --> 00:02:43,780
a let me come to sell

40
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:48,370
reconfiguring a and this is say that
instead a new building

41
00:02:48,370 --> 00:02:52,250
assembling them and I i should point out
that what you're holding your hand is

42
00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:54,720
not set that's a more general

43
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:58,090
the connector for something this picking
system

44
00:02:58,090 --> 00:03:01,500
very hard so we haven't really quite
that

45
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:04,510
a self configuring

46
00:03:04,510 --> 00:03:08,500
want to make spouses assembling the
modules

47
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:12,860
I it's also worth mentioning that the

48
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:16,120
not only can the rearrange themselves
amongst other

49
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:20,230
but they can also change the properties
this is what that one can do

50
00:03:20,230 --> 00:03:24,380
they can be longer they can hold onto
each other and angles that to change the

51
00:03:24,380 --> 00:03:25,310
color or

52
00:03:25,310 --> 00:03:28,700
or stuff like that this gives very very

53
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:33,230
wide Scopus chain you can adjust
ourselves a fraction of an inch

54
00:03:33,230 --> 00:03:37,360
or we could turn ourselves from a a a
sofa to the table

55
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:42,580
depending on what we want to do so the
want to mention

56
00:03:42,580 --> 00:03:46,420
and modularity put together I mean
nobody can deny

57
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:49,910
the significance of automation or model
I'd

58
00:03:49,910 --> 00:03:53,440
it's basically the the foundation for
our society today

59
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:58,060
%uh put together we get something really
exciting

60
00:03:58,060 --> 00:04:02,030
you get universal physical machine at

61
00:04:02,030 --> 00:04:05,440
to to join a

62
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:09,400
analogy there is to say that at the
computer will

63
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:13,110
we just call it the computer but it is
actually a general

64
00:04:13,110 --> 00:04:16,820
comp computing machine capable of
simulating

65
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:21,070
any a dedicated comp

66
00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:24,080
computing machine the ones we had before
the gulf

67
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:27,570
what we call the computer and even
further by backed them that they were

68
00:04:27,570 --> 00:04:28,440
actually people

69
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:35,340
it was a joke title to be a computer you
did temptation by hand so what would be

70
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:40,659
yeah if you could create this amazing
working selfie configuring

71
00:04:40,659 --> 00:04:44,990
of Texas a and

72
00:04:44,990 --> 00:04:50,300
22 of 22 to to do talk about that I'd
like to also you a question which I

73
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:51,039
paraphrase

74
00:04:51,039 --> 00:04:55,669
from from saying apart and its from his
presentation

75
00:04:55,669 --> 00:04:59,590
usually referred to as the mother of all
the most if you haven't seen that one

76
00:04:59,590 --> 00:05:02,169
online you should definitely check it
out

77
00:05:02,169 --> 00:05:06,030
percent something that is a mix of
Twitter or

78
00:05:06,030 --> 00:05:09,639
Windows all this put together and it's
like 40 years old

79
00:05:09,639 --> 00:05:13,860
shows us how it could work so he says

80
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:17,460
if you have a system no cost
environmentally friendly

81
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:21,710
virtually unbreakable but for many
fiscal structures

82
00:05:21,710 --> 00:05:25,729
perform any costs what value could you
drive from

83
00:05:25,729 --> 00:05:28,949
and that's what I hope to

84
00:05:28,949 --> 00:05:32,930
to talk about I shows the title known

85
00:05:32,930 --> 00:05:36,069
no natural resources were assembling the
sofa

86
00:05:36,069 --> 00:05:41,580
because bomb it's naturally a paraphrase

87
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:45,080
line you sometimes most of the season
and the movies

88
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:50,550
a no no animals were harmed in the
making of this motion picture

89
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:53,569
I'll so I shows this title

90
00:05:53,569 --> 00:05:58,270
because one of the things that's up
terrible this would allow us to do

91
00:05:58,270 --> 00:06:02,060
is the drastically change our
relationship raw materials

92
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:06,249
the stuff that the world around us is
made of

93
00:06:06,249 --> 00:06:09,819
I'll

94
00:06:09,819 --> 00:06:13,139
because when assembling one thing

95
00:06:13,139 --> 00:06:16,509
in in a separate robotic system

96
00:06:16,509 --> 00:06:19,590
as we do in the computer we use only and

97
00:06:19,590 --> 00:06:22,620
I mean when we note another software of
used

98
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:26,210
another software use only energy the
computer stays the same

99
00:06:26,210 --> 00:06:29,270
and it's the same thing with the modulus
said beginning

100
00:06:29,270 --> 00:06:33,279
robotic system the model stays the same
and we use them for different things

101
00:06:33,279 --> 00:06:36,529
me out a little bit too many do that
allows them to sell be configured

102
00:06:36,529 --> 00:06:40,069
and then we've got table so share a bad

103
00:06:40,069 --> 00:06:45,590
whatever

104
00:06:45,590 --> 00:06:51,069
and of course we can do that time and
time again

105
00:06:51,069 --> 00:06:51,629
and this could

106
00:06:51,629 --> 00:06:55,629
drastically slowed down the rate its raw
materials

107
00:06:55,629 --> 00:06:59,319
close to our society the way us today
goes from natural resources

108
00:06:59,319 --> 00:07:04,669
products and then to waste basically
landfill we try to recycling there but

109
00:07:04,669 --> 00:07:05,650
it's quite hard

110
00:07:05,650 --> 00:07:09,009
because we get this huge mix of
everything so in the bin

111
00:07:09,009 --> 00:07:12,969
hard to know what what's actually in
there and recycling the best way

112
00:07:12,969 --> 00:07:16,719
so you use

113
00:07:16,719 --> 00:07:20,308
only what you need right now Chris
whatever

114
00:07:20,309 --> 00:07:23,620
you since you could always assemble

115
00:07:23,620 --> 00:07:26,879
watching it at any given time you only
have

116
00:07:26,879 --> 00:07:30,610
a what you need right now

117
00:07:30,610 --> 00:07:33,900
this could seem simple but what you
don't

118
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:37,360
it's not there because when you need it
with the same

119
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:40,550
a and this is significant

120
00:07:40,550 --> 00:07:44,460
think about how efficiently actually
Jews most the stuff we have

121
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:48,449
it's been reported that life his life

122
00:07:48,449 --> 00:07:53,529
average power real issues 14 the rest of
the time

123
00:07:53,529 --> 00:07:57,509
1528 just sits there shell a

124
00:07:57,509 --> 00:08:00,779
so that's the fact that we have

125
00:08:00,779 --> 00:08:04,719
but don't have don't is very sick

126
00:08:04,719 --> 00:08:09,129
but it doesn't actually and their

127
00:08:09,129 --> 00:08:13,589
there are a number of other features
that changes our relationship through

128
00:08:13,589 --> 00:08:14,330
material

129
00:08:14,330 --> 00:08:18,219
instinct as a part of said thinking
optics

130
00:08:18,219 --> 00:08:21,779
I I'm gonna

131
00:08:21,779 --> 00:08:25,270
talk about a few of them if you wanna
talk about this more I'm here all

132
00:08:25,270 --> 00:08:29,229
all although the conference but I'm
gonna mention a few of them

133
00:08:29,229 --> 00:08:33,639
via the more important thing is that we
could use the module for its

134
00:08:33,639 --> 00:08:37,360
entire service life until it simply
isn't usable

135
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:41,500
and very few things I guess that party
lists thrown away

136
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:45,610
long before it's worn out have a hard
time seeing you worrying about in 40

137
00:08:45,610 --> 00:08:46,149
minutes

138
00:08:46,149 --> 00:08:50,800
I am you can use it for the phone
service life

139
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:54,480
and even if its not up to a hundred
percent specification

140
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:58,470
there's always many situations rates
capabilities are more than enough to be

141
00:08:58,470 --> 00:08:59,060
use

142
00:08:59,060 --> 00:09:02,399
and

143
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:05,649
when d'amato breaks I mean they're gonna
break they're gonna be

144
00:09:05,649 --> 00:09:10,800
so only don't use them anymore we can
actually since we do a few types a

145
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:11,589
modulus

146
00:09:11,589 --> 00:09:14,699
we could actually bring them back into
the factory and disassemble them

147
00:09:14,699 --> 00:09:19,000
and reuse the components within them to
say that something is broken

148
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,079
is very likely that most the park's in
whatever is broken

149
00:09:22,079 --> 00:09:25,699
are perfectly alright it's just one or
two parts that are broken

150
00:09:25,699 --> 00:09:28,990
here since we have few types but many of
them

151
00:09:28,990 --> 00:09:32,130
we can bring them back into the factory
disassemble the mall you

152
00:09:32,130 --> 00:09:36,459
and use the parts that are okay again
and of course we could do this again and

153
00:09:36,459 --> 00:09:37,579
again and again until

154
00:09:37,579 --> 00:09:40,589
that particular part is not use

155
00:09:40,589 --> 00:09:46,730
one I'll and

156
00:09:46,730 --> 00:09:51,269
even if its when we decide to more jobs
where they move for instance or

157
00:09:51,269 --> 00:09:55,360
how they use their war but since we know
kinda where they are

158
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:59,410
warned and how we can have we can handle
that

159
00:09:59,410 --> 00:10:02,829
in another way save me disassemble the
module beget apart out

160
00:10:02,829 --> 00:10:07,850
it isn't really up to spec but it's not
too far out suspect so we can rework the

161
00:10:07,850 --> 00:10:08,410
model

162
00:10:08,410 --> 00:10:12,810
may be answered your washer way it moves
a little bit thick you water them use

163
00:10:12,810 --> 00:10:13,680
the first time

164
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:18,689
and that could actually use the mobile
again maybe in a module at in only

165
00:10:18,689 --> 00:10:23,829
the park in a model that is only at acid
lower specification but it still usable

166
00:10:23,829 --> 00:10:24,420
for some

167
00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:31,420
most the time I and

168
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:36,149
soon related the park is not gonna be
useful it's going to be our respect it's

169
00:10:36,149 --> 00:10:36,990
gonna be old

170
00:10:36,990 --> 00:10:40,000
we don't want in but since we know
exactly what

171
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:45,649
the material is made out of its we can
actually recycled raw material heart

172
00:10:45,649 --> 00:10:49,230
more efficient than we do today X you
know exactly what we have

173
00:10:49,230 --> 00:10:53,120
we know exactly how to treat it to
recycling the most efficient way

174
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:56,600
this actually one of the bigger problems
in recycling today

175
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:59,750
know exactly what you go that and and

176
00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:03,569
to substances mixed together that's the
the two hard issues

177
00:11:03,569 --> 00:11:09,959
up but to come back to the the beginning
where we actually make the module

178
00:11:09,959 --> 00:11:14,510
since the surface or whatever reassemble
and the internal structure

179
00:11:14,510 --> 00:11:17,689
are two separate parts I we

180
00:11:17,689 --> 00:11:21,050
I guess we wouldn't build the bad doubt
that the model I just passed around

181
00:11:21,050 --> 00:11:24,730
kinda hard would probably be very
uncomfortable I

182
00:11:24,730 --> 00:11:29,980
then we could a.m. that

183
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:33,309
that the fact that the surface and the
internals are two

184
00:11:33,309 --> 00:11:37,410
separate things which means we could
actually use recycled raw materials to

185
00:11:37,410 --> 00:11:38,020
make

186
00:11:38,020 --> 00:11:41,050
that ninety percent of the internal
structure

187
00:11:41,050 --> 00:11:45,420
and just use new materials for the
surface and what you see and interact

188
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:48,449
so not only can we recycle much more
efficiently

189
00:11:48,449 --> 00:11:51,980
we can also use recycled material that
is available

190
00:11:51,980 --> 00:11:56,839
in a way that is not possible today

191
00:11:56,839 --> 00:12:03,839
on behind

192
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,380
so

193
00:12:08,380 --> 00:12:13,250
sad to say this is not all for free this
is Modena robotics has many issues

194
00:12:13,250 --> 00:12:16,680
and some other Mar not sole some other
Mar kinda soul

195
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:20,960
and others we're working on right now
overhead the modularity

196
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:24,070
is one of the challenges we face a
because

197
00:12:24,070 --> 00:12:27,190
a dedicated custom component can always
be

198
00:12:27,190 --> 00:12:30,600
perfectly adapted to a

199
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:34,720
the situation it's supposed to work
practically that's rarely so

200
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:38,370
because we cannot have bomb tuneful
bonds on each tossed

201
00:12:38,370 --> 00:12:43,520
them need and infinite number tools so
although the the

202
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:46,600
the custom argument there is

203
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:49,720
valid and interesting in practice it's
not ass

204
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:53,010
a significant as one might think I am

205
00:12:53,010 --> 00:12:58,520
I'll

206
00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:01,560
and also in a

207
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:04,750
selfie configuring modern robotic system
we could

208
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:08,230
at that the amount of overhead being

209
00:13:08,230 --> 00:13:14,110
corporate in the system I depending on
what we want for the system

210
00:13:14,110 --> 00:13:17,690
so we could France to say that we we
want the system to be very responsive

211
00:13:17,690 --> 00:13:19,650
you wanted to be able to transform

212
00:13:19,650 --> 00:13:22,970
fast and and then be

213
00:13:22,970 --> 00:13:26,900
have to accept that the risk higher
overhead than for a system that doesn't

214
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:27,980
have to be able

215
00:13:27,980 --> 00:13:33,340
to task to transform ass rapid at
Francis this is

216
00:13:33,340 --> 00:13:36,540
a we could actually turn it from Siro up
to

217
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:41,750
a some former maxwell we could build a
brick wall with a system like this and

218
00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:44,720
then we can save the wall is not much
change for a very long time

219
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:48,310
I so let's just remove the rover that
built the so

220
00:13:48,310 --> 00:13:51,690
10 needs at that time it's not longer a
sub reconfiguring

221
00:13:51,690 --> 00:13:56,560
system it's just their I and in another
solution we might want to change it

222
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:57,320
faster

223
00:13:57,320 --> 00:14:01,210
and then we say okay in there is certain
overhead for this but we're gonna keep a

224
00:14:01,210 --> 00:14:01,940
number these

225
00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:05,110
reconfiguring units in the system

226
00:14:05,110 --> 00:14:09,610
but can also than change so when it
comes to the argument though

227
00:14:09,610 --> 00:14:14,080
overhead a model I T I usually say that
it is the lowest form

228
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:17,520
the lowest level overhead that should be
compared

229
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:20,699
to a custom-made parts because and

230
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:23,830
anything more than the lowest level s

231
00:14:23,830 --> 00:14:28,860
is a feature not a not a cost it's a bug
it's a feature not a bug

232
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:32,430
I so

233
00:14:32,430 --> 00:14:37,230
that argument can be quite well handed
especially if you then consider the fact

234
00:14:37,230 --> 00:14:38,040
that the recent

235
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:42,030
and overhead of on modularity or
non-local ITT

236
00:14:42,030 --> 00:14:45,500
to support you have to make that custom
component a

237
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:48,920
and that's much harder making just more
of the same thing you already know how

238
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:49,400
to do

239
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:54,930
I to make this system where

240
00:14:54,930 --> 00:14:58,130
we use the models we need at a specific
time

241
00:14:58,130 --> 00:15:02,390
were a the best we can we need to prune

242
00:15:02,390 --> 00:15:06,660
are more and we need to draw more deals
from approved when we need them

243
00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:10,620
and return them to the pool when we go
basically like our share

244
00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:15,430
this though is a is both a %uh an
opportunity and a problem because

245
00:15:15,430 --> 00:15:21,589
the the pool will be a common thing and
this many ships around privacy security

246
00:15:21,589 --> 00:15:24,720
access to more deals a and what you can

247
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:28,460
actually do with them I mean if you want
to do something that is likely to

248
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:31,570
to destroy them on yours are you allowed
to and

249
00:15:31,570 --> 00:15:35,460
stuff like that so pooling is an issue
it's a it's it's a it's a

250
00:15:35,460 --> 00:15:42,460
opportunity but it's also an issue
septic nothing more than a robotics is

251
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:44,360
gonna

252
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:47,370
address many things basically in the end

253
00:15:47,370 --> 00:15:50,970
we see that everything fiscal around you
that you can touch

254
00:15:50,970 --> 00:15:54,740
will be built by systems thats

255
00:15:54,740 --> 00:15:59,440
far off in the future but even if we
just do 10 percent democracy around

256
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:02,920
which is certainly possible especially
orchid in

257
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:07,589
I can mention architecture we're making
great headway in architecture house

258
00:16:07,589 --> 00:16:11,600
I business this is gonna

259
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:15,800
upset a lot of people I mean spent so
much changes

260
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:20,520
and there are way some arguing for the
fact that it's going to be a very rapid

261
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:22,130
change I

262
00:16:22,130 --> 00:16:25,480
the only solution I have there is to be
open

263
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:28,560
allow everybody access to the system's

264
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:32,450
I to allow education about this system's

265
00:16:32,450 --> 00:16:35,490
for everyone free I and of course

266
00:16:35,490 --> 00:16:38,760
as and as a level playing field as
possible so that

267
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:42,410
everyone can participate and do stuff
with the news

268
00:16:42,410 --> 00:16:49,410
with this new technology so what does
this mean for for for the hockey

269
00:16:49,930 --> 00:16:51,860
community we hear that hope I mean

270
00:16:51,860 --> 00:16:55,329
most of us like to do stuff tinker with
things and and

271
00:16:55,329 --> 00:16:58,350
to to just not consume it also

272
00:16:58,350 --> 00:17:05,280
kinda produce I

273
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:09,990
there are many things that that that I
think that that the hacker community

274
00:17:09,990 --> 00:17:15,160
with dull with modern robotics I markets
are reasonably cheap ass

275
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:18,790
competitive to custom parts that are
made in small series or

276
00:17:18,790 --> 00:17:22,510
or are stuff like that these can be made
you serious

277
00:17:22,510 --> 00:17:26,510
and with them drop in price and of
course you only pay for them and you

278
00:17:26,510 --> 00:17:27,540
actually use them

279
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:31,000
so you don't have to buy them in the
same way you do

280
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:35,140
to do with general components that it's
hard to know somebody wants them

281
00:17:35,140 --> 00:17:42,140
when you're done I

282
00:17:42,140 --> 00:17:44,300
and it's also so that since the or so

283
00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:49,159
general if you wanted to develop it work
with the software Park which is probably

284
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:53,270
ninety percent what we're talking about
the hardware modding robotics is very

285
00:17:53,270 --> 00:17:54,639
hard but you only have to do it

286
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:58,410
wats when somebody interconnected that
works OK

287
00:17:58,410 --> 00:18:03,000
we've done that I mean just make more
but the Soccer Park is gonna be

288
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,500
shoot work I and venue Jan

289
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:09,960
you can start with developing used to
simulate to YouTube Aug you've got your

290
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:10,850
system working

291
00:18:10,850 --> 00:18:14,480
okay but you have to test it on the
fiscal motives to see

292
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:18,950
if it works in in real life and I can
tell you there's a very big step between

293
00:18:18,950 --> 00:18:19,710
those two

294
00:18:19,710 --> 00:18:23,410
not a modern a robotic system works
great in simulation

295
00:18:23,410 --> 00:18:27,160
very few works warm in reality

296
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:31,480
I but since they're all the same it
would be very easy for somebody and I'm

297
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:33,620
actually working with something to try
to do that

298
00:18:33,620 --> 00:18:37,080
to provide the more deals for testing
purposes virtually

299
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:41,730
remotely so you do simulation work to do
development you go on to this website

300
00:18:41,730 --> 00:18:45,150
you can test them against the models and
see whether they were

301
00:18:45,150 --> 00:18:48,730
get feedback from what doesn't work and
and and

302
00:18:48,730 --> 00:18:52,530
do do it that way and that means that
you'd only pay for the little bit of

303
00:18:52,530 --> 00:18:53,020
time

304
00:18:53,020 --> 00:18:56,310
at which is this going to be
ridiculously she

305
00:18:56,310 --> 00:18:59,679
just like web hosting today or all the
things we take

306
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:04,370
take for granted in in the web world %ah

307
00:19:04,370 --> 00:19:08,460
as I experimentation cost next to
nothing

308
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:11,460
the margins are cheap and you just get
them when you need them

309
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:16,290
I'll another factor is that when you
when you want to start doing something

310
00:19:16,290 --> 00:19:20,060
montana robotics I here you get the
advantage of

311
00:19:20,060 --> 00:19:23,940
not being custom components I'll because

312
00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:27,700
it's going to be leveraged in and us ice
icy

313
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:31,080
see waz at the first waiver wave forces

314
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:34,830
you have this eco-system all the modules
that somebody ever did

315
00:19:34,830 --> 00:19:38,310
and you can just use the Leveson it
ceases to to

316
00:19:38,310 --> 00:19:41,379
I incorporates what somebody did because

317
00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:45,560
the module the connector works ass a
black box interface basically

318
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:48,889
if somebody's margin work it's just take
it and

319
00:19:48,890 --> 00:19:55,890
and run with it how up

320
00:19:57,490 --> 00:20:00,930
the second thing that the I find to be a
big leverage

321
00:20:00,930 --> 00:20:04,230
this is I am that

322
00:20:04,230 --> 00:20:08,630
somebody's probably have the same

323
00:20:08,630 --> 00:20:12,620
problem with it wanted to work with the
something similar to what you want to do

324
00:20:12,620 --> 00:20:16,490
and since the modern parts are general
you could probably

325
00:20:16,490 --> 00:20:20,080
East more easily build on what they did
than if they

326
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:23,629
build it out custom components from
scratch every time

327
00:20:23,630 --> 00:20:27,280
is this going to be this small nagging
freeware the issues that makes it

328
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:28,330
impossible for

329
00:20:28,330 --> 00:20:32,530
for you too to use what they did and of
course when you're done and you got

330
00:20:32,530 --> 00:20:33,399
something working

331
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:37,200
Jorma we going to the pool and everybody
could just use that

332
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:40,200
and they could use it as it is so they
can modify

333
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:44,050
a and course you could just share this
with the world and

334
00:20:44,050 --> 00:20:51,050
win great Carmo you could selling if you
want

335
00:20:51,859 --> 00:20:54,939
to embarrassed or I would like to come
back to this

336
00:20:54,940 --> 00:20:58,669
question again this time I

337
00:20:58,669 --> 00:21:02,539
I'm gonna just say that if you had this
system

338
00:21:02,539 --> 00:21:05,649
this no cost environmentally friendly

339
00:21:05,649 --> 00:21:09,720
virtually unbreakable at the margins are
placed themselves if they break

340
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:14,889
theirself reconfiguring at perform any
fiscal structures performance of

341
00:21:14,889 --> 00:21:18,690
what value could you drive from I hope
that

342
00:21:18,690 --> 00:21:22,259
that got put some ideas in your head and
that you think that

343
00:21:22,259 --> 00:21:25,909
the critical to try this and I i out
because its very easy

344
00:21:25,909 --> 00:21:28,960
we could tryout many many different
things here

345
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:33,809
just during the two days ago I and

346
00:21:33,809 --> 00:21:37,399
because it's basically free we don't
when

347
00:21:37,399 --> 00:21:40,669
when we leave here the models will be
exactly the same as when I

348
00:21:40,669 --> 00:21:43,889
and ira so there's no cost associated

349
00:21:43,889 --> 00:21:49,169
except the little friend I guess
somewhere somewhere out someone at the

350
00:21:49,169 --> 00:21:49,950
pay for them

351
00:21:49,950 --> 00:21:54,349
I I would really like for you to

352
00:21:54,349 --> 00:21:58,700
to to help me you know this bringing
this out into the real world it's just

353
00:21:58,700 --> 00:22:02,009
about to come there this one you see is
made with rapid growth

354
00:22:02,009 --> 00:22:06,059
rapid prototyping but it is commercially
available the fun for kids is

355
00:22:06,059 --> 00:22:09,229
also commercially available and more

356
00:22:09,229 --> 00:22:13,440
its solid systems where you could build
restructures

357
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:17,340
the snack together and that's great but
there is systems coming out that you

358
00:22:17,340 --> 00:22:18,449
could build I

359
00:22:18,450 --> 00:22:22,229
been these share sodomy city on this
table is I

360
00:22:22,229 --> 00:22:25,859
and they're still active still have
motors are sensors and

361
00:22:25,859 --> 00:22:30,139
operating system so you can also program
I'm looking forward to building

362
00:22:30,139 --> 00:22:34,679
go karts other those when I get them
which is sad enough

363
00:22:34,679 --> 00:22:39,070
probably towards the winter which means
I'll have the students that the Sullivan

364
00:22:39,070 --> 00:22:42,590
sweet so that would be a modular ski-doo

365
00:22:42,590 --> 00:22:45,720
up there are a few

366
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:49,700
a open source projects that you can
contribute to that you can

367
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:53,440
use at No love them ourselves become
thinking I'm sorry to say

368
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:56,989
they are modular I'll I'm working on a
project

369
00:22:56,989 --> 00:23:01,169
that would probably hopefully and make
it possible

370
00:23:01,169 --> 00:23:05,210
to create a open source free for
everyone

371
00:23:05,210 --> 00:23:08,399
ok 3s in speech and beer I guess

372
00:23:08,399 --> 00:23:12,210
except for the modules I but assess if
they can be

373
00:23:12,210 --> 00:23:15,529
pagey I embed it more important than

374
00:23:15,529 --> 00:23:19,840
free maybe open you will have a pillar
rights with access to them

375
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:23,049
and you will have a set the
responsibilities and

376
00:23:23,049 --> 00:23:27,908
the community as a whole would work with
setting those rights

377
00:23:27,909 --> 00:23:31,980
and obligations I'll be putting up some
things to these

378
00:23:31,980 --> 00:23:35,379
I open source projects on my long I

379
00:23:35,379 --> 00:23:39,399
tomorrow and also a number a video where
you can see

380
00:23:39,399 --> 00:23:43,580
the Senate reconfiguring systems in
action because they actually do work

381
00:23:43,580 --> 00:23:47,309
quite nicely in the lab which of course
is like saying they don't

382
00:23:47,309 --> 00:23:51,700
you want but its still cool to see them
transform from a snake

383
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:55,129
to at four a told basically you can see
them

384
00:23:55,129 --> 00:23:58,309
coming walking along SSF four legged
creature

385
00:23:58,309 --> 00:24:01,519
protecting that the slope is too high
for them to do that

386
00:24:01,519 --> 00:24:05,539
and then they become a snake in them do
the incline as a snake

387
00:24:05,539 --> 00:24:09,309
and then they realize that now this
background then they go over to walking

388
00:24:09,309 --> 00:24:10,428
like to talk again so

389
00:24:10,429 --> 00:24:14,289
Thessalonica videos out there I'm also
gonna

390
00:24:14,289 --> 00:24:17,419
put up some resources a I

391
00:24:17,419 --> 00:24:21,249
where you can find more information it's
very heavily researched

392
00:24:21,249 --> 00:24:24,690
space as most for this development the
stunning the university environment

393
00:24:24,690 --> 00:24:25,409
right now

394
00:24:25,409 --> 00:24:28,639
but I think it is ready to come out into
the

395
00:24:28,639 --> 00:24:33,169
its garage readies what I'd like to say
you can actually think about this

396
00:24:33,169 --> 00:24:36,289
in your garage and you could do it
tomorrow

397
00:24:36,289 --> 00:24:39,919
and anchor continue his 222 to the pool
and

398
00:24:39,919 --> 00:24:44,019
everything is grows exponentially I'll
so

399
00:24:44,019 --> 00:24:51,019
any questions I said yeah

400
00:24:56,240 --> 00:25:00,150
yeah

401
00:25:00,150 --> 00:25:04,110
actually scaling up from the chair is
what we think is

402
00:25:04,110 --> 00:25:08,300
it's not easy the requirements list for
the connector which of course is what

403
00:25:08,300 --> 00:25:11,340
hi no is like 50 different fire

404
00:25:11,340 --> 00:25:14,439
I am it wouldn't use the same

405
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:17,450
because satisfying all those
fifteen-month connected just

406
00:25:17,450 --> 00:25:22,400
dick impossible but say that we would
use the same connector but we could use

407
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:26,220
one connector for the chair and then one
connector for the house

408
00:25:26,220 --> 00:25:29,260
%uh and yes there are

409
00:25:29,260 --> 00:25:34,160
alternatives both to make a really
really small connector is actually hard

410
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:37,740
%uh one that could become sup million
each year and we could do

411
00:25:37,740 --> 00:25:41,210
not only each working share but a
beautiful on that

412
00:25:41,210 --> 00:25:44,900
we can look at and see K looks like
share a

413
00:25:44,900 --> 00:25:48,470
yeah not one

414
00:25:48,470 --> 00:25:53,230
that's the Holy Grail basically to make
one connector that not only scales

415
00:25:53,230 --> 00:25:56,950
from from the really small the really
big but that this cancels

416
00:25:56,950 --> 00:26:00,430
compatible so that you could at touched
something that was ten percent smaller

417
00:26:00,430 --> 00:26:01,510
to something

418
00:26:01,510 --> 00:26:05,100
and then something that ten percent
smaller than that and then some you go

419
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:06,300
all the way down to

420
00:26:06,300 --> 00:26:12,700
a mister fineman levels they spent a
room at the bottom

421
00:26:12,700 --> 00:26:15,900
yes but yeah that's a very good question
but yes

422
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:19,450
theoretically and practically going up
from

423
00:26:19,450 --> 00:26:25,920
that share not a not an issue any other

424
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:32,099
yeah

425
00:26:32,099 --> 00:26:39,099
yeah

426
00:27:06,669 --> 00:27:13,669
did

427
00:27:17,289 --> 00:27:20,799
yet what we call that is basically more
what we're doing today

428
00:27:20,799 --> 00:27:25,510
we if we would want to do robotic
architecture we wouldn't start building

429
00:27:25,510 --> 00:27:27,220
the whole house what we would do is

430
00:27:27,220 --> 00:27:32,700
for instance these these walls that are
behind me is actually a a modular system

431
00:27:32,700 --> 00:27:33,460
i mean

432
00:27:33,460 --> 00:27:37,350
now we can have one big room we can have
to small room so we can adapt our

433
00:27:37,350 --> 00:27:38,240
environment so

434
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:42,990
doing what you say is that the them
coexisting of regular

435
00:27:42,990 --> 00:27:46,120
technology with this absolutely that's

436
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:49,690
certainly something that would be would
be where we would start

437
00:27:49,690 --> 00:27:55,429
I use basically what you build a house
like this you build the

438
00:27:55,429 --> 00:28:00,200
source and you build the walls but you
need everything open I have an ex awful

439
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:00,950
there that s

440
00:28:00,950 --> 00:28:05,399
if you did that to your apartment it
would be more significant the sink set

441
00:28:05,399 --> 00:28:07,380
say that you had all the space

442
00:28:07,380 --> 00:28:10,740
just in one open open space and then you
had a a

443
00:28:10,740 --> 00:28:15,049
then there is that this simple popular
vote this up because the modern robotic

444
00:28:15,049 --> 00:28:15,559
system

445
00:28:15,559 --> 00:28:18,870
event able to put up walls but if you do
this point I want

446
00:28:18,870 --> 00:28:22,669
all there and in civil there say that
you have this apartment

447
00:28:22,669 --> 00:28:25,710
I and since you could use the space

448
00:28:25,710 --> 00:28:29,520
for whatever your wall at you don't have
to buy as much

449
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:33,179
she'd actually afford to buy an
apartment in that good neighborhood that

450
00:28:33,179 --> 00:28:34,029
you always wanted

451
00:28:34,029 --> 00:28:37,480
but you couldn't because it's very
expensive I but

452
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:40,750
since you now can adapt your space to
whatever you need

453
00:28:40,750 --> 00:28:44,309
that's no problem say that you buy your
gonna live there with your

454
00:28:44,309 --> 00:28:48,250
significant other you by I guess is
crappy I don't know forty

455
00:28:48,250 --> 00:28:52,710
sixties 40 square meters maybe and you
want to have a dinner party this is the

456
00:28:52,710 --> 00:28:54,360
example on running so

457
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:57,460
you gonna have a dinner party you need a
big kitchen to prepare the food

458
00:28:57,460 --> 00:29:02,000
so you have a big tits to prepare the
food and after that the food is done

459
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:02,760
it's Ian

460
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:06,020
bodice name this is reasonably big pitch
in the SIR

461
00:29:06,020 --> 00:29:09,100
don't usually have a that size fits
peace advocacy

462
00:29:09,100 --> 00:29:13,320
you having just like that need a lot of
food you need two bathrooms

463
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:16,539
you gonna take a shower I

464
00:29:16,539 --> 00:29:21,059
guest starts to ride you need one big
space for

465
00:29:21,059 --> 00:29:26,010
for for just socializing and you want to
just two toilets no charge just two

466
00:29:26,010 --> 00:29:28,580
toilets or uniform because you don't
want

467
00:29:28,580 --> 00:29:33,620
lines 24 I then you need to a table so
that everybody can sit down

468
00:29:33,620 --> 00:29:38,880
you get a table I and when the dinner's
over a couple your friends party

469
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:42,020
spend the night because you gonna go
shopping or whatever tomorrow

470
00:29:42,020 --> 00:29:45,049
I and then your question better

471
00:29:45,049 --> 00:29:49,350
San and within this space you could do
all that space flies

472
00:29:49,350 --> 00:29:53,460
but it would be very expensive to have
although these just standing

473
00:29:53,460 --> 00:29:57,860
waiting for you to use so if we could
juice

474
00:29:57,860 --> 00:30:01,549
our whole space all of the time it be
very fish

475
00:30:01,549 --> 00:30:05,760
but as ice yeah that's definitely what
we're going to do even allow them to

476
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:12,760
coexist any other questions

477
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:28,440
yes the sisters house Ltd

478
00:30:33,020 --> 00:30:36,840
the morning himself probably not be self
healing but the solution

479
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:40,430
the whole George if your share

480
00:30:40,430 --> 00:30:44,640
contained a broken module transfers the
checkered have a feature that

481
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:47,970
detective left for the person sitting on
the chair and adapting

482
00:30:47,970 --> 00:30:52,660
so that even if you're if you're for to
use it comfortably if you're

483
00:30:52,660 --> 00:30:57,060
6-foot-4 you sit comfortably because she
had a tax on all your not thats

484
00:30:57,060 --> 00:31:01,540
I and of course

485
00:31:01,540 --> 00:31:05,720
then had a broken module that would you
could be automatically replaced

486
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:09,850
and and and then I guess what
automatically return to the factory

487
00:31:09,850 --> 00:31:14,670
and there you have to take a decision
rather to reuse the park's recycling

488
00:31:14,670 --> 00:31:19,110
in the park but the models themselves
were probably not be

489
00:31:19,110 --> 00:31:23,240
the same feeling on on that level this
is actually also

490
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:28,350
yep know that's also the difference
between

491
00:31:28,350 --> 00:31:31,770
that the cell-free producing machine a

492
00:31:31,770 --> 00:31:35,070
this could become a selfie producing
system

493
00:31:35,070 --> 00:31:38,689
because there's nothing stopping you
from building a %uh mining truck

494
00:31:38,690 --> 00:31:42,100
or or any kind of system needed the

495
00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:45,230
to make the modulus themselves so

496
00:31:45,230 --> 00:31:52,230
it's not a selfie producing machine but
it's a selfie producing system yeah

497
00:31:55,170 --> 00:31:59,830
architects are very skeptical about this
as they tried before and it very hard to

498
00:31:59,830 --> 00:32:06,830
get it to work

499
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:15,779
yeah

500
00:32:15,779 --> 00:32:22,779
I'm here for two day

501
00:33:31,660 --> 00:33:38,660
yeah yeah

502
00:33:39,540 --> 00:33:43,370
I'd like to say that that learn in
Norman amount from me because that's who

503
00:33:43,370 --> 00:33:43,910
say that

504
00:33:43,910 --> 00:33:48,220
we are some be configured more durable
everyone to view the pictures something

505
00:33:48,220 --> 00:33:49,660
completely modular robot

506
00:33:49,660 --> 00:33:53,380
your well rover nothing but yourself

507
00:33:53,380 --> 00:33:56,960
camping anyway and you're definitely
some feeling which is very nice

508
00:33:56,960 --> 00:34:02,000
otherwise we love you would be me to use
the smallest cop killers immediately be

509
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:02,670
oneself

510
00:34:02,670 --> 00:34:05,810
I so I'd say is that the father

511
00:34:05,810 --> 00:34:10,029
I think it was the first question was
that have yeah be known and Norma some

512
00:34:10,030 --> 00:34:10,600
out from

513
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:13,850
from nature I how to control these

514
00:34:13,850 --> 00:34:18,219
Darch group of almost uses very hard
it's not you can't just not right

515
00:34:18,220 --> 00:34:21,990
line code say do this do that its
becomes impossible immediately

516
00:34:21,990 --> 00:34:27,120
I they use for remote control basically
like ants control the

517
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:30,650
that the hive other the and I'm a

518
00:34:30,650 --> 00:34:36,639
they also use I actually one of them
architecture project stateville houses

519
00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:37,350
with the same

520
00:34:37,350 --> 00:34:42,060
or what we think is the same algorithms
ass at termites build their nests

521
00:34:42,060 --> 00:34:46,840
termites are not her smart features but
they build fantastic nests

522
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:50,320
they maintain them very nicely and they
can growth in S

523
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:53,400
wild investors in News so say that

524
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:57,180
that be like moving into a one bedroom
apartment and living there

525
00:34:57,180 --> 00:35:02,020
while the construction workers made it a
two bedroom apart and of course

526
00:35:02,020 --> 00:35:05,430
fix the roof or whatever yeah awake you
had a second question

527
00:35:05,430 --> 00:35:12,430
and can you do that again

528
00:35:14,059 --> 00:35:16,359
talked about it being related to 3d
printing

529
00:35:16,359 --> 00:35:19,598
at you can't do them all to see you yeah

530
00:35:19,599 --> 00:35:24,009
you can't do it CDP it but it's not
necessarily I think it is actually

531
00:35:24,009 --> 00:35:27,329
a maybe I shouldn't say this here many
thanks be competing with T

532
00:35:27,329 --> 00:35:31,930
pic-a-state if anything is I I know that
they're trying to make it to a full

533
00:35:31,930 --> 00:35:32,500
circle

534
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:37,390
thing where where they where they think
and then granulate the past again and we

535
00:35:37,390 --> 00:35:38,348
do it again but

536
00:35:38,349 --> 00:35:42,730
week Alice that step at they can do

537
00:35:42,730 --> 00:35:46,349
very nice of the clinton like very nice
position

538
00:35:46,349 --> 00:35:49,619
but they have to go through the printer
weekend

539
00:35:49,619 --> 00:35:56,619
yes reassemble them on you and without
going through the fence

540
00:36:08,970 --> 00:36:10,580
yeah

541
00:36:10,580 --> 00:36:13,750
I got the perfect also for you right
here yeah

542
00:36:13,750 --> 00:36:18,390
I again be learned from nature I dream

543
00:36:18,390 --> 00:36:22,210
long be tried to do self-organizing

544
00:36:22,210 --> 00:36:25,360
systems for a long time 22 uphold

545
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:28,830
solutions to our problems the way we
have the old

546
00:36:28,830 --> 00:36:33,490
from from from the environment armenian
basically but it's very hard to do

547
00:36:33,490 --> 00:36:37,010
when when I components are too large so

548
00:36:37,010 --> 00:36:41,160
this actually two professors in Japan
but just published a book on this

549
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:45,330
it's called cell-free reorganize
self-organizing robots it's a fantastic

550
00:36:45,330 --> 00:36:45,980
read

551
00:36:45,980 --> 00:36:49,030
surprisingly reasonable for

552
00:36:49,030 --> 00:36:52,660
book of that nature actually and more
they

553
00:36:52,660 --> 00:36:56,600
talk about 22 they talk about a lot of
stuff in the book but what they

554
00:36:56,600 --> 00:37:00,060
talk about is that instead of saying I
want to

555
00:37:00,060 --> 00:37:03,410
to watch EXTRA exactly like this behave
exactly like that

556
00:37:03,410 --> 00:37:09,089
I define a set a ruse and then I prefer
be started simulation by holding

557
00:37:09,090 --> 00:37:10,280
something that looks

558
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:14,630
reasonably close to what I wall and then
of course I can put it out there

559
00:37:14,630 --> 00:37:18,290
in the real world and allow the
components

560
00:37:18,290 --> 00:37:21,550
to evolve a chair that fits my needs

561
00:37:21,550 --> 00:37:25,930
this is also very important because self
because self healing comes from

562
00:37:25,930 --> 00:37:30,240
the self-organizing because it simply
that takes its not fulfilling that goal

563
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:36,060
and any that that and we've seen that in
simulation also to a certain degree in

564
00:37:36,060 --> 00:37:38,040
hardware the connectors still playing

565
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:41,520
house the bad connectors we have are
still a very hard problem

566
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:45,790
I but in simulation BC that I

567
00:37:45,790 --> 00:37:49,700
gates for instance how robots walk whole
very nicely

568
00:37:49,700 --> 00:37:53,740
and many other things just a bowl if you
allowing if you give it the

569
00:37:53,740 --> 00:37:56,910
the eco-system to do so we can a former

570
00:37:56,910 --> 00:38:01,700
the products we do so yeah this sinus
fantastic important and

571
00:38:01,700 --> 00:38:05,020
with a more something on your system
under

572
00:38:05,020 --> 00:38:08,270
system we could do to sign in a
fundamentally different way

573
00:38:08,270 --> 00:38:11,780
but I definitely like talk to more
serious

574
00:38:11,780 --> 00:38:15,170
I'm outside when I'm done I'm gonna be
here tomorrow and

575
00:38:15,170 --> 00:38:18,690
Sunday to and I'm gonna have the robots
here for you too

576
00:38:18,690 --> 00:38:25,690
to try different set up yeah

577
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:28,280
yeah

578
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:31,250
yeah yeah the yeah Center

579
00:38:31,250 --> 00:38:35,550
on a comp this area draw some some
having names and this

580
00:38:35,550 --> 00:38:39,790
you mentioned the seller cellular
automaton which is fun moments where

581
00:38:39,790 --> 00:38:43,440
and he actually he just the fall there
this work with us alert

582
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:48,070
cellular phone the sucking easy died
before you finish that work died

583
00:38:48,070 --> 00:38:52,760
very John I think it was 56 there is
speculation that he was exposed to

584
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:55,130
radiation during the Manhattan Project
which

585
00:38:55,130 --> 00:38:58,880
course worked on I but you have to send
it on atomic Tom is

586
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:03,670
the basis for our research for right
about now then comes

587
00:39:03,670 --> 00:39:06,890
a a Penrose

588
00:39:06,890 --> 00:39:10,279
the mathematician important for I

589
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:13,850
and the modern version of

590
00:39:13,850 --> 00:39:16,960
this research was started by a man
should have called up

591
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:21,820
when he was working on a the CNC machine
with interchangeable tools

592
00:39:21,820 --> 00:39:25,150
so he was working on making the robot a

593
00:39:25,150 --> 00:39:28,390
the machine collected to let real love a
second I mention

594
00:39:28,390 --> 00:39:33,049
use it for a while return it to the
storage pick up another to do something

595
00:39:33,050 --> 00:39:36,080
and he said instead of you doing it just
for the two

596
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:40,480
why can't I do it for the whole machine
i mean sometimes I need a strong but

597
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:45,350
reason to slow n and the motor and other
times I need a very fast but not

598
00:39:45,350 --> 00:39:46,620
necessarily that strong

599
00:39:46,620 --> 00:39:50,870
motor and if I could put the strong
motor back in the pool when I don't need

600
00:39:50,870 --> 00:39:51,210
it

601
00:39:51,210 --> 00:39:54,620
somebody else like so he started the the
the work

602
00:39:54,620 --> 00:39:57,859
and this post lay 80s and

603
00:39:57,860 --> 00:40:01,200
Upton I would say I to 2000's

604
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:04,480
progress was very academic very heavy on
math by

605
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:08,540
tried to read the cellular automaton
papers and just impossible to understand

606
00:40:08,540 --> 00:40:09,170
for me

607
00:40:09,170 --> 00:40:12,560
I IIT I i feel now

608
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:16,890
there are commercial projects the basic
fundamental law

609
00:40:16,890 --> 00:40:20,980
algorithms stuff are reasonably good so
I think that

610
00:40:20,980 --> 00:40:25,250
five years from now this is garage ready
five years from now

611
00:40:25,250 --> 00:40:28,390
everybody can tinker with this and
they're all and and you could start

612
00:40:28,390 --> 00:40:29,230
already now

613
00:40:29,230 --> 00:40:32,260
because it's actually much easier to
build the module and then build the

614
00:40:32,260 --> 00:40:33,370
check out the models

615
00:40:33,370 --> 00:40:36,970
than it is to build the chair from star
special somebody else

616
00:40:36,970 --> 00:40:43,970
the marginal

617
00:41:12,120 --> 00:41:16,009
yes yeah and at this point not only I
mean this actually worse guys than the

618
00:41:16,010 --> 00:41:18,130
commercial guys because you can deal
with those

619
00:41:18,130 --> 00:41:21,620
you give the money they're nice to you
but but it but if the government does

620
00:41:21,620 --> 00:41:22,370
that to you

621
00:41:22,370 --> 00:41:26,470
and your government isn't nice I'd don't
want to live in a world where

622
00:41:26,470 --> 00:41:29,890
where about government-controlled these
things yeah others

623
00:41:29,890 --> 00:41:34,279
definitely privacy issues there's so
many issues are on safety and security

624
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:37,870
and and your control over your
environment yes absolutely

625
00:41:37,870 --> 00:41:41,790
I I don't see this aspect call

626
00:41:41,790 --> 00:41:46,279
pic MCUs even though we're going for
high-resolution

627
00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:49,500
unit a hatreds homogeneous system that's

628
00:41:49,500 --> 00:41:53,370
way way off in the future I so I think
that actually

629
00:41:53,370 --> 00:41:57,250
I'm working on a project a where we
gonna set up an environment where you

630
00:41:57,250 --> 00:41:59,240
can send your the signs for modulation

631
00:41:59,240 --> 00:42:04,100
and we make it for you so you don't have
to be an expert in machining or

632
00:42:04,100 --> 00:42:07,430
a few depending on whatever you just
have to be

633
00:42:07,430 --> 00:42:11,549
somebody that wants to to view it and we
take care the biggest that's a challenge

634
00:42:11,550 --> 00:42:12,600
in modern politics

635
00:42:12,600 --> 00:42:15,630
when you do a prototype younger you do
one or two

636
00:42:15,630 --> 00:42:18,680
but to do anything significant you have
that Penn

637
00:42:18,680 --> 00:42:22,839
15 or even a thousand and when you do a
thousand or something

638
00:42:22,840 --> 00:42:26,730
your you do too many of them to be

639
00:42:26,730 --> 00:42:30,440
done by hand and you too few of them to
do with them

640
00:42:30,440 --> 00:42:33,830
in dusty so that's a big challenge but
yeah there's

641
00:42:33,830 --> 00:42:39,110
definitely many issues around privacy
security I don't think that the

642
00:42:39,110 --> 00:42:40,750
commercial guy so the big problem

643
00:42:40,750 --> 00:42:45,520
we can develop but but governments are
certain your problem I

644
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:49,410
but I think this this an opportunity

645
00:42:49,410 --> 00:42:52,450
to do it's better this time than

646
00:42:52,450 --> 00:42:56,870
and then we did maybe with computers
because we all are out here and we're

647
00:42:56,870 --> 00:42:58,819
doing stuff it's not done by

648
00:42:58,820 --> 00:43:02,330
dogs institutions and the government we
could do this together

649
00:43:02,330 --> 00:43:06,580
and then of course we will also need so

650
00:43:06,580 --> 00:43:13,580
yeah yeah

651
00:43:19,480 --> 00:43:23,349
jet yeah I had the pleasure of
interviewing the guy from ipod cost who

652
00:43:23,349 --> 00:43:25,119
worked on those they are just amazing

653
00:43:25,119 --> 00:43:28,609
should I introduced permanent magnet and
then you can go on

654
00:43:28,609 --> 00:43:33,098
you know about the regular Mac nothing
we know about the a.m electromagnet and

655
00:43:33,099 --> 00:43:33,859
and making my

656
00:43:33,859 --> 00:43:36,910
magnetic effect that turn power on it
because

657
00:43:36,910 --> 00:43:39,980
medic and and return to power of its not
like that

658
00:43:39,980 --> 00:43:43,109
that's a terrible singer doing it
because that's all thanks a lot of power

659
00:43:43,109 --> 00:43:46,190
all those bad things and the permanent
mounting the can of course use

660
00:43:46,190 --> 00:43:49,390
can turn it off but he mentions elector
permanent magnets

661
00:43:49,390 --> 00:43:53,319
and day are a former magnet that when
you give them the pulse of energy

662
00:43:53,319 --> 00:43:57,619
they talk in the state between magnetic
and not so you

663
00:43:57,619 --> 00:44:01,720
a store first the power it becomes like
that short burst the power

664
00:44:01,720 --> 00:44:05,640
it's not like that anymore its like
magic yes and

665
00:44:05,640 --> 00:44:08,779
yeah so now everybody knows what a
permanent electromagnet this

666
00:44:08,780 --> 00:44:15,780
a which I guess someone you love you
know so on the question

667
00:44:44,970 --> 00:44:48,330
yeah if you remove the micro from the
name it's already here

668
00:44:48,330 --> 00:44:54,080
yeah and I'm it. in Boston they've got
if he works on the elect a man is that's

669
00:44:54,080 --> 00:44:56,210
where the use it is called the wrong
with Pavel

670
00:44:56,210 --> 00:45:01,810
its 11 millimetres cue and Leo
stochastic a

671
00:45:01,810 --> 00:45:05,070
said set/sets per family so what you do
is you

672
00:45:05,070 --> 00:45:08,200
don't have remodeled with with amid a
schematic it's not

673
00:45:08,200 --> 00:45:11,540
it's complicated but that's not going to
that right now you

674
00:45:11,540 --> 00:45:14,640
put them in a bag to shake them and the
Maldives hit

675
00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:18,109
and okay this is correct this is not
correct the sample

676
00:45:18,110 --> 00:45:21,130
so then you could pull your because I'm

677
00:45:21,130 --> 00:45:24,270
you can also use a just assemble them
into 21 think not

678
00:45:24,270 --> 00:45:28,160
and it says every model decides whether
on the park to the

679
00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:32,120
the solution of if I'm not part of the
solution i turn my Mac is often I follow

680
00:45:32,120 --> 00:45:35,509
so from a from a do you get a dog bite

681
00:45:35,510 --> 00:45:38,840
noting the shape of the dog into the
cuban everybody else just says

682
00:45:38,840 --> 00:45:42,990
when I go back to the pool call me when
you need so yes certainly they elect a

683
00:45:42,990 --> 00:45:43,380
pack

684
00:45:43,380 --> 00:45:47,400
and they are very nice because this came
with size we talked about size with you

685
00:45:47,400 --> 00:45:47,920
before

686
00:45:47,920 --> 00:45:54,920
and they get better and better the
smaller they are

687
00:46:02,550 --> 00:46:07,530
I I should actually I I'll I'll talk to
the people that no one put it on my blog

688
00:46:07,530 --> 00:46:07,839
but

689
00:46:07,839 --> 00:46:11,500
yeah but I understand is that yes it's
not that

690
00:46:11,500 --> 00:46:16,010
far-off they didn't them 11 me let me
take you because that's what they could

691
00:46:16,010 --> 00:46:18,349
do in the lab again they had to do a lot
of them

692
00:46:18,349 --> 00:46:21,560
this another project you know what
impresses of this

693
00:46:21,560 --> 00:46:25,049
the one you do on on the tipper

694
00:46:25,050 --> 00:46:30,310
I am I like actors you figure that out
myself I don't have to give you an idea

695
00:46:30,310 --> 00:46:31,609
about any other

696
00:46:31,609 --> 00:46:35,150
did that's the test program in France
now it shows you that all the

697
00:46:35,150 --> 00:46:38,450
degrees from work I don't don't get your

698
00:46:38,450 --> 00:46:41,640
Fingaz past because it's reasonably
strong I'll

699
00:46:41,640 --> 00:46:44,920
I yet you know the press box

700
00:46:44,920 --> 00:46:49,580
you do it from head over to the
toothbrush you put it vibrating motor on

701
00:46:49,580 --> 00:46:50,049
there any

702
00:46:50,050 --> 00:46:54,020
runs around on your table I a guy
decided to do

703
00:46:54,020 --> 00:46:58,430
a thousand 24 robles so one single PhD
students

704
00:46:58,430 --> 00:47:01,700
bill akin about the row that's a

705
00:47:01,700 --> 00:47:05,710
big project right so he had to look at
all love these parts and

706
00:47:05,710 --> 00:47:10,450
he's previous work was the algorithms
the mathematics behind it but he decided

707
00:47:10,450 --> 00:47:11,320
I'm going to bed

708
00:47:11,320 --> 00:47:15,200
2024 over and that's what he did there
15 bucks a pop

709
00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:18,880
spent fifteen thousand but he actually
had the building by hot

710
00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:22,000
and I was saying to him that you very

711
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:25,740
Amos like saying all this so hard to
build the house know them and I said

712
00:47:25,740 --> 00:47:26,670
Jordan

713
00:47:26,670 --> 00:47:30,410
lucky guy just the next PhD student just
about the

714
00:47:30,410 --> 00:47:33,740
the megabyte the robot semester to be a
pain in the ass out ther

715
00:47:33,740 --> 00:47:38,390
so yeah scale I is very hard but they're
working on it ap

716
00:47:38,390 --> 00:47:41,560
mine view lately has been that

717
00:47:41,560 --> 00:47:45,839
we're not gonna as he's talked about the
Chevy not have the same connector and

718
00:47:45,839 --> 00:47:48,759
within the house Aspen rebuild the chair
or when we build the

719
00:47:48,760 --> 00:47:52,250
something really small we're not gonna
have the same process

720
00:47:52,250 --> 00:47:55,500
up getting the item I but

721
00:47:55,500 --> 00:47:59,810
the system as a whole is gonna be
complete a selfie configuring

722
00:47:59,810 --> 00:48:03,299
press the send that we want to have a
really smooth and curved surface or

723
00:48:03,300 --> 00:48:03,859
something

724
00:48:03,859 --> 00:48:07,589
we could actually have an assembly unit
within the solution

725
00:48:07,589 --> 00:48:10,980
that makes component out the really
really small parts

726
00:48:10,980 --> 00:48:14,010
and then pass them along at a higher
scale

727
00:48:14,010 --> 00:48:21,010
at something that could become a bigger
biggest Dec

728
00:48:28,910 --> 00:48:31,109
yeah

729
00:48:31,109 --> 00:48:34,020
it has to be done that way I i think

730
00:48:34,020 --> 00:48:37,390
if we only have like five or ten to
twenty thousand units we could probably

731
00:48:37,390 --> 00:48:38,700
centrally controlled them

732
00:48:38,700 --> 00:48:41,880
but when we come down to doing something
in there really

733
00:48:41,880 --> 00:48:45,920
view high resolution we get trillion
some units that's the only way

734
00:48:45,920 --> 00:48:50,150
there's no way you can centrally control
them because timing issues Miami

735
00:48:50,150 --> 00:48:57,150
it simply practically impossible

736
00:49:00,079 --> 00:49:02,240
yeah

737
00:49:02,240 --> 00:49:08,090
yeah I guess probably probably be more
efficient to use the clout than but yeah

738
00:49:08,090 --> 00:49:12,640
but who knows I mean 50 to say what you
can't do

739
00:49:12,640 --> 00:49:17,200
with the scent be configured modern
robotic system says it is universal

740
00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:18,190
fiscal machine

741
00:49:18,190 --> 00:49:21,430
it's basically impossible is a what can
you do with the computer

742
00:49:21,430 --> 00:49:24,339
well that depends on average a
programmer you are more than anything

743
00:49:24,340 --> 00:49:25,010
else so

744
00:49:25,010 --> 00:49:28,200
yeah any other questions

745
00:49:28,200 --> 00:49:32,100
how I recruited you to the

746
00:49:32,100 --> 00:49:36,440
said be competing mother robotics
project you like being nice to the

747
00:49:36,440 --> 00:49:38,580
environment a new

748
00:49:38,580 --> 00:49:42,700
do cool stuff for free and I i mean

749
00:49:42,700 --> 00:49:46,460
I mean if we do this right i mean we
learned a lot from how computers and the

750
00:49:46,460 --> 00:49:49,050
internet was introduced if we do it
right this time

751
00:49:49,050 --> 00:49:52,140
it could be free ass in beer and speech

752
00:49:52,140 --> 00:49:55,580
and this thing that actually costs of

753
00:49:55,580 --> 00:50:00,170
could be very very very very very very
cheap for us that's

754
00:50:00,170 --> 00:50:03,870
according to have but there's a couple
billion people in the world that

755
00:50:03,870 --> 00:50:08,930
it would be essential for purse that
aspect back

756
00:50:08,930 --> 00:50:14,740
we have the and interesting twenty years
ahead on the site so

757
00:50:14,740 --> 00:50:17,230
yeah

758
00:50:17,230 --> 00:50:24,230
%uh sorry I didn't see their the lights
No

759
00:50:54,540 --> 00:50:59,550
yeah March other I had the pleasure
interviewing

760
00:50:59,550 --> 00:51:04,829
in hong kong recently yeah he said

761
00:51:04,829 --> 00:51:11,829
big balled up though he's a big motor I
can tell you yeah

762
00:51:26,920 --> 00:51:31,670
I think that we probably aiming for what
you say that that the analog systems

763
00:51:31,670 --> 00:51:34,719
they have to be very very small investor

764
00:51:34,719 --> 00:51:38,789
I mean the sea views when you do a
thousand of them and they have to BSA

765
00:51:38,789 --> 00:51:39,700
microscale

766
00:51:39,700 --> 00:51:43,160
we don't have a lot of computer power
each bomb so

767
00:51:43,160 --> 00:51:46,690
I'm thinking that and I think market
than being bought searching me

768
00:51:46,690 --> 00:51:50,489
advocate for that point-of-view and and
I think that's valid

769
00:51:50,489 --> 00:51:53,549
I don't think you really know and I
think that in my own way we can come

770
00:51:53,549 --> 00:51:55,729
back to that with different connectors a
different scale

771
00:51:55,729 --> 00:52:00,190
maybe some systems and some parts
assistance might want to use one of them

772
00:52:00,190 --> 00:52:03,410
and other system or other part 7 a
system

773
00:52:03,410 --> 00:52:07,808
more want to use both of them we can
also dynamically adjusts

774
00:52:07,809 --> 00:52:13,160
where we use each because 3 don't build
each and every looks like that if yeah

775
00:52:13,160 --> 00:52:17,219
we could just adapt ourselves continues
it could even

776
00:52:17,219 --> 00:52:21,469
perceive you do that itself to evolve

777
00:52:21,469 --> 00:52:25,119
a system for eighty percent is done one
way in 20 sent the other way

778
00:52:25,119 --> 00:52:28,880
if the text that the situation has
changed and another

779
00:52:28,880 --> 00:52:35,600
itself

780
00:52:35,600 --> 00:52:38,980
anymore I'm here for two days so

781
00:52:38,980 --> 00:52:42,650
you don't have to ask knocking on I
don't know the time maybe the next

782
00:52:42,650 --> 00:52:43,840
speaker wants to come in

783
00:52:43,840 --> 00:52:46,980
what's the time okay space
