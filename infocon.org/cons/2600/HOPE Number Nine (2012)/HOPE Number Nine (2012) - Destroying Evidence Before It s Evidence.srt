1
00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:03,590
is really focus on and they're going to
be three specific scenarios

2
00:00:03,590 --> 00:00:07,240
that i'm gonna talk about a more
detailed the first is the crime

3
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:11,099
an anticipatory obstruction of justice
the second

4
00:00:11,099 --> 00:00:15,559
is the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act in
that bernie is some potential

5
00:00:15,559 --> 00:00:19,050
legal issues surrounding encryption now

6
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:23,410
it's not all doom and gloom I am gonna
cover these three things but I'm also

7
00:00:23,410 --> 00:00:23,850
gonna

8
00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:27,099
I promise give some tips about how you
can protect yourself

9
00:00:27,099 --> 00:00:31,119
I so you can make sure the feds and the
cops on come knocking at your door

10
00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:34,680
the second disclaimer is on when we get
to

11
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:38,540
I'm gonna leave sometime at the end for
questions if you get a chance to come up

12
00:00:38,540 --> 00:00:39,730
and ask a question

13
00:00:39,730 --> 00:00:43,879
are not great just please don't tell me
any sensitive legal

14
00:00:43,879 --> 00:00:47,129
issue you're currently an are tell me
you know real

15
00:00:47,129 --> 00:00:50,339
intimate details because you're going to
waive the attorney-client privilege in a

16
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:51,420
room filled with people

17
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:56,120
okay so those are my two introductory
can not sing with that let's get into

18
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:58,039
its ok

19
00:00:58,039 --> 00:01:03,719
when we talk about the traditional crime
obstruction of justice

20
00:01:03,719 --> 00:01:07,540
that crime is a crime that's been on the
books for a very long time

21
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:11,880
in it has traditionally had five things
that the government is required to prove

22
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:12,920
in order to show

23
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:16,900
that a person is guilty other crime
obstruction of justice the first thing

24
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:18,689
is that there has to be a pending

25
00:01:18,689 --> 00:01:23,340
preceding weird when the documents were
destroyed now that proceeding could be

26
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:26,560
a judicial judicial proceeding
congressional

27
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:29,840
could be a federal investigation doesn't
really matter

28
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:34,290
so much but there has to be something
currently going on at the time

29
00:01:34,290 --> 00:01:37,759
the obstruction is alleged to have taken
place

30
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:41,430
second the person who does the
destruction has the actually

31
00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:47,520
no that work is a proceeding third and
most importantly is there has to be a

32
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:48,490
nexus

33
00:01:48,490 --> 00:01:51,979
between the document destruction in the
preceding now

34
00:01:51,979 --> 00:01:56,100
what Nexus means is that the active
destruction

35
00:01:56,100 --> 00:02:00,250
must have a relationship and either time
causation

36
00:02:00,250 --> 00:02:04,280
were logic with the judicial proceeding
what this really means

37
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:08,410
is that it captures an idea in the law
called materially

38
00:02:08,410 --> 00:02:11,890
and make sure that whatever it is that's
being destroyed his

39
00:02:11,890 --> 00:02:16,430
actually important not bad it's just
some any random document

40
00:02:16,430 --> 00:02:20,010
that's being destroyed that instead this
is something that is integral

41
00:02:20,010 --> 00:02:23,390
to the pursuit of whatever the feds are
investigating

42
00:02:23,390 --> 00:02:26,860
and when I say fed them I'm obviously
talk about the federal

43
00:02:26,860 --> 00:02:30,280
criminal investigator agencies but I can
also be talking about local law

44
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:31,120
enforcement as well

45
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:34,519
okay the fourth thing is that there has
to be

46
00:02:34,519 --> 00:02:38,819
a corrupt act Don with the intent to
interfere with the proceedings so this

47
00:02:38,819 --> 00:02:39,400
is really

48
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:42,209
two things which is why I said there are
five things that the government has to

49
00:02:42,209 --> 00:02:44,599
prove so they have to show that you
kinda did it with

50
00:02:44,599 --> 00:02:49,660
guilty intention so to speak and your
intention has to be to you

51
00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:53,140
interfere with the actual proceeding so
you know

52
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:56,620
you know that does it but the you're
being investigated for

53
00:02:56,620 --> 00:03:01,260
computer hacking some sort honor the
CFAA and they want some

54
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:04,959
you know they know that the rapid in a
federal after some emails you send in

55
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:05,510
you say

56
00:03:05,510 --> 00:03:09,010
Husker those guys wanna delete every
email I never sent so they don't catch

57
00:03:09,010 --> 00:03:09,290
it

58
00:03:09,290 --> 00:03:13,260
because I don't want to go to jail for
this computer fraud and abuse such crime

59
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:17,209
I'm committed you know I'm charged with
thats thats the traditional sense

60
00:03:17,209 --> 00:03:20,620
obstruction of justice ochem now

61
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:23,959
anticipatory obstruction of justice

62
00:03:23,959 --> 00:03:27,720
is aid newer criminal statute it's on

63
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:32,190
been on the books but link fence the
early 2000's was part

64
00:03:32,190 --> 00:03:36,890
part is our main artfully actin idea was
that congress wanted to make sure

65
00:03:36,890 --> 00:03:41,799
that proceeding that important documents
were not destroyed

66
00:03:41,799 --> 00:03:46,540
on before anything had actually occurred
in terms of a formal investigation

67
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:49,929
and so this is the text that the statute
but really the most important thing you

68
00:03:49,930 --> 00:03:51,379
have to take a look is here

69
00:03:51,379 --> 00:03:56,409
at the very end were in relation to our
contemplation have any such matter

70
00:03:56,409 --> 00:04:02,400
what you know if you can to strip away
all of the actual legally is taxed this

71
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:05,920
statue which are really left win is
demanding that the government has to

72
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:06,769
prove first

73
00:04:06,769 --> 00:04:11,080
that the defendant knowingly altered or
deleted so not accidentally

74
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:14,810
are not inadvertently but that he
knowingly altered or deleted or did

75
00:04:14,810 --> 00:04:15,569
something

76
00:04:15,569 --> 00:04:18,859
and second that he had the intent to
impede an active

77
00:04:18,858 --> 00:04:21,948
or contemplated government investigation

78
00:04:21,949 --> 00:04:26,639
memnoch again when you strip away

79
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:30,330
the legally is the statute really says a
couple things

80
00:04:30,330 --> 00:04:34,840
first there's no requirement that you
destroy something important

81
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:39,350
so that's that i dnt reality bad the
traditional obstruction of justice

82
00:04:39,350 --> 00:04:40,820
statute was concerned with

83
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:44,610
that is absent and when you think about
it it makes sense because

84
00:04:44,610 --> 00:04:47,979
its in relation or contemplation I love

85
00:04:47,979 --> 00:04:51,639
a pending investigation so how did the
beds know what's important

86
00:04:51,639 --> 00:04:54,710
if they have an investigator opened an
investigation yet

87
00:04:54,710 --> 00:04:58,690
that's why there's none there is not
that materiality requirement

88
00:04:58,690 --> 00:05:01,770
second there's no requirement that you
know the investigation again it goes

89
00:05:01,770 --> 00:05:03,270
back to the idea that there has

90
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:06,508
there doesn't have to be an actual
investigation

91
00:05:06,509 --> 00:05:10,000
because there's no requirement to you
actually obstruct an investigation for

92
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,830
that to even be an investigation

93
00:05:12,830 --> 00:05:16,000
okay now what's even worse

94
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:21,190
believe it or not is that to federal
appellate circuit court so the second in

95
00:05:21,190 --> 00:05:22,240
Fitzer gets

96
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:25,699
had held that a likelihood

97
00:05:25,699 --> 00:05:29,530
an investigation is not even required so
we're not even talking about a situation

98
00:05:29,530 --> 00:05:30,690
where

99
00:05:30,690 --> 00:05:35,620
you may think at well what I'm doing is
probably going to get me in trouble

100
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:39,560
that's not required at least into very
large appellate circuits okay

101
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:42,949
so the statute is pretty broad

102
00:05:42,949 --> 00:05:47,710
it can get you in some trouble on in the
last presentation there was a discussion

103
00:05:47,710 --> 00:05:49,020
at the case a

104
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:53,659
Luebbe Remington I am you I'm I'm gonna
confess I'm not familiar with that case

105
00:05:53,660 --> 00:05:56,949
by just based on what the description of
it was this was a

106
00:05:56,949 --> 00:06:00,470
for for some people who maybe dinner
time last night this was a

107
00:06:00,470 --> 00:06:05,710
situation where a gun manufacture made a
gun that was defective so that when you

108
00:06:05,710 --> 00:06:09,340
I had the safety it actually discharge
yeah guess that

109
00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:13,180
could but actually be a problem I could
see that and and received sir and

110
00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:15,319
complains about it from customers and

111
00:06:15,319 --> 00:06:19,960
to the complaints and deleted them okay
that had the situation is what could

112
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:24,840
print is precisely captured by the
statute be anticipatory only

113
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:28,250
deleted something before there was any

114
00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:31,490
active investigation open looking at

115
00:06:31,490 --> 00:06:34,720
the action involved okay the case

116
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:38,750
i wanna talk to you folks about is a
case remained you may be familiar with

117
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:41,199
its the case in United States Perseus
kernel

118
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:44,210
and for those of you who aren't familiar
with this case this

119
00:06:44,210 --> 00:06:47,699
is the Sarah Palin email hacker case
okay

120
00:06:47,699 --> 00:06:51,190
now what happen in that case basically

121
00:06:51,190 --> 00:06:54,490
mister colonel I through a variety

122
00:06:54,490 --> 00:06:58,069
I'll guessing and Wikipedia surging

123
00:06:58,069 --> 00:07:01,830
was able to hack into Sarah Palin's
email in 2008

124
00:07:01,830 --> 00:07:05,979
okay and this is a time line up kinda
the step-by-step things that happened in

125
00:07:05,979 --> 00:07:07,409
this case in the reason I put this

126
00:07:07,410 --> 00:07:10,919
up there is because the timing is
important so obviously

127
00:07:10,919 --> 00:07:14,780
at midnight he hacked into Sarah Palin's
email your proxy

128
00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:18,419
at 1am he'd brags about the hacking
4chan

129
00:07:18,419 --> 00:07:22,719
at some point he deletes images that he
downloaded from her email

130
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:25,729
onto the computer now what's important
to remember is

131
00:07:25,729 --> 00:07:29,300
he did not actually get any sensitive
information from

132
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:32,590
the email account so it wasn't like he
all the sudden got a bunch of

133
00:07:32,590 --> 00:07:35,699
really important sensitive government
documents basically I think he

134
00:07:35,699 --> 00:07:37,639
downloaded picture Bristol Palin

135
00:07:37,639 --> 00:07:42,360
and saw some email back and forth that
was nothing really remarkable

136
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:46,020
but heaps downloaded some that
information took some screenshots

137
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:47,530
download the pictures

138
00:07:47,530 --> 00:07:51,150
at some point though he deleted that
information okay

139
00:07:51,150 --> 00:07:54,990
now we don't know the exact timing and
when that happen but it was very early

140
00:07:54,990 --> 00:07:57,370
on in this process

141
00:07:57,370 --> 00:08:02,599
later did in the chatroom basically
someone tells kernel that she contacted

142
00:08:02,599 --> 00:08:03,219
the FBI

143
00:08:03,220 --> 00:08:07,250
whether or not this actually happened
nobody really knows

144
00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:10,830
at two oh well at 2:01 a.m. he pose the
password on 4chan

145
00:08:10,830 --> 00:08:14,780
later in the thread is deleted on and
then a little bit after that

146
00:08:14,780 --> 00:08:17,979
the people in campaign lines at the hack
and then

147
00:08:17,979 --> 00:08:21,270
you know obviously they notified the FBI
and the Secret Service

148
00:08:21,270 --> 00:08:25,319
and then you know ago a little bit later
on kernel basically tells a friend on

149
00:08:25,319 --> 00:08:26,349
base but that

150
00:08:26,349 --> 00:08:29,990
he's afraid to the FBI because he think
he did something really bad okay

151
00:08:29,990 --> 00:08:33,979
I'm wedge you know bed and probably get
instant

152
00:08:33,979 --> 00:08:38,430
that part adapt okay now

153
00:08:38,430 --> 00:08:43,550
later he takes a more steps he uses
Internet Explorer cache

154
00:08:43,549 --> 00:08:47,060
I thinking that this will a racist
tracks which obviously

155
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:51,190
it won't I am and then Gawker picks up
the story

156
00:08:51,190 --> 00:08:56,220
arm he then decides to refit reformat is
hard drive me and installs Firefox ear

157
00:08:56,220 --> 00:08:57,620
and the defragment

158
00:08:57,620 --> 00:09:01,850
and at that point the next day at all
really successful right

159
00:09:01,850 --> 00:09:05,910
now the next day the FBI eventually
calls colonels dad and he's looking for

160
00:09:05,910 --> 00:09:07,300
colonel now that abstract

161
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:11,810
there is because once colonel actually
finds out that the feds are looking for

162
00:09:11,810 --> 00:09:12,200
him

163
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:15,730
he begins to investigate and the other
important thing is

164
00:09:15,730 --> 00:09:20,529
the FBI was able to track him down in
figure out what he did

165
00:09:20,529 --> 00:09:23,939
not true any in the actual stuff that he
downloaded

166
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:27,019
or any of the stuff that he deleted okay

167
00:09:27,019 --> 00:09:30,399
so if you think about the idea other
struction adjusters

168
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:34,760
babe Adam they've got a pretty quick
nothing sensitive got out

169
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:38,089
no pending criminal investigation was in
place at the time

170
00:09:38,089 --> 00:09:42,649
okay now important but ultimately

171
00:09:42,649 --> 00:09:45,930
colonels indicted is indicted for
identity theft

172
00:09:45,930 --> 00:09:49,339
is indicted for criminal fraud their
computer fraud and abuse act

173
00:09:49,339 --> 00:09:53,820
wire fraud and the anticipatory
obstruction of justice

174
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:57,480
okay now when he goes to trial is
ultimately

175
00:09:57,480 --> 00:10:00,510
acquitted on the wire fraud he has a
mis-trial

176
00:10:00,510 --> 00:10:04,019
an ID that basically the jury couldn't
reach a verdict a hung

177
00:10:04,019 --> 00:10:07,480
and he was guilty of the lesser Computer
Fraud and Abuse Act charge basically he

178
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:09,060
was convicted on the misdemeanor

179
00:10:09,060 --> 00:10:13,959
but he was convicted a B felony
anticipatory instruction just the statue

180
00:10:13,959 --> 00:10:17,510
so what happened was for the crime of
downloading

181
00:10:17,510 --> 00:10:21,610
are hacking into Sarah Palin's e-mail
and downloading this dour

182
00:10:21,610 --> 00:10:25,579
when he got in most trouble for was the
act are the leading

183
00:10:25,579 --> 00:10:31,130
mister okay even though it did not
prevent the fed's from finding

184
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:36,560
now what this really kinda boils down to
is

185
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:40,050
that the he was convicted on the base is
an activity that took place before the

186
00:10:40,050 --> 00:10:42,990
FBI initiated or contemplated
investigation

187
00:10:42,990 --> 00:10:46,410
and before he knew he was actually being
investigated now

188
00:10:46,410 --> 00:10:50,189
he was why you did he was being
investigated

189
00:10:50,190 --> 00:10:54,050
he was probably and rightfully so a
little paranoid about what he done

190
00:10:54,050 --> 00:10:58,170
but he didn't actually no writer

191
00:10:58,170 --> 00:11:02,120
so really the crime hinge less on is
actions

192
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:06,070
in the raid impacted the actual
investigation and more on his state of

193
00:11:06,070 --> 00:11:06,589
mind

194
00:11:06,589 --> 00:11:10,990
when he acted now when this case one up
on appeal to the Sixth Circuit

195
00:11:10,990 --> 00:11:14,620
but the government argued was that
colonel had the intent

196
00:11:14,620 --> 00:11:17,779
to impede because I have two things
first and yet

197
00:11:17,779 --> 00:11:22,829
actual notice based on the user who said
he would be a rad amount FBI

198
00:11:22,829 --> 00:11:26,540
and second that he contemplated he would
get in trouble because he said he was

199
00:11:26,540 --> 00:11:27,550
afraid of the FBI

200
00:11:27,550 --> 00:11:30,589
so this was what the government our gym
and

201
00:11:30,589 --> 00:11:35,570
the sick circuit ultimately held that he
did not have an actual notice and its

202
00:11:35,570 --> 00:11:38,690
boat was statements made on 4chan have
no indicia

203
00:11:38,690 --> 00:11:43,339
arrived on tape no bids

204
00:11:43,339 --> 00:11:48,980
but sounds about right yeah okay

205
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:52,850
our but unfortunately for mister kernel
they found that he had actually

206
00:11:52,850 --> 00:11:56,260
contemplated federal investigation and
that's because

207
00:11:56,260 --> 00:11:59,399
there was a belief that a federal
investigation directed at the

208
00:11:59,399 --> 00:12:01,050
defendant's conduct might

209
00:12:01,050 --> 00:12:05,990
begin at some point in the future
satisfies the in contemplation prom

210
00:12:05,990 --> 00:12:09,209
the Sixth Circuit admitted that
contemplation in this context is very

211
00:12:09,209 --> 00:12:10,370
broad

212
00:12:10,370 --> 00:12:14,410
and they said yeah so what that's what
congress one

213
00:12:14,410 --> 00:12:17,569
okay so again

214
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:22,329
not better was likely about you know
factually speaking

215
00:12:22,329 --> 00:12:26,620
yeah I think it's safe to say that if
you happen to the vice president their

216
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:28,160
candidates email

217
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:31,899
your likely gonna get in trouble and
have the feds come come after you

218
00:12:31,899 --> 00:12:35,630
but they didn't hinge their the legal
world to come out if it is not a hinged

219
00:12:35,630 --> 00:12:36,000
on a

220
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,620
its hinged on he believed he might get
in trouble

221
00:12:39,620 --> 00:12:42,750
okay so this is the first

222
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:46,220
kinda situation that

223
00:12:46,220 --> 00:12:50,779
you know presents itself about this idea
destroying evidence before evidence this

224
00:12:50,779 --> 00:12:54,110
this very broad very scary crime

225
00:12:54,110 --> 00:12:57,510
ardent is a bit or instruction just
after

226
00:12:57,510 --> 00:13:01,089
second thing I want to talk about is the
CFAA this is the Computer Fraud and

227
00:13:01,089 --> 00:13:02,190
Abuse Act

228
00:13:02,190 --> 00:13:05,500
it's a very long complicated

229
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:10,019
tortured statue it was initially
designed to capture

230
00:13:10,019 --> 00:13:13,440
you know people who you know broke into

231
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:17,230
sensitive computers like government
computers banking computers

232
00:13:17,230 --> 00:13:20,959
unfortunately it's been broadened
significantly

233
00:13:20,959 --> 00:13:24,730
I'll less by congress and more by the
way

234
00:13:24,730 --> 00:13:27,790
courts have interpreted the terms and
the sea obey

235
00:13:27,790 --> 00:13:31,480
so whereas it used in a kind you know
where's like there's easy cases like a

236
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:33,810
Diaz attack could potentially get you
into

237
00:13:33,810 --> 00:13:36,820
CIA trouble per I think obvious reasons

238
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:40,730
it's now being used to you know
prosecute people for sending

239
00:13:40,730 --> 00:13:44,260
you know too many emails there's a case

240
00:13:44,260 --> 00:13:49,399
where and there was a labor dispute in
the Union decided to bombard management

241
00:13:49,399 --> 00:13:51,519
with a whole bunch in emails

242
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:54,550
and that was found to be a CPA violation

243
00:13:54,550 --> 00:13:58,940
it's been expanded to cover terms abuse
violations although that something

244
00:13:58,940 --> 00:14:03,130
you know if that has bought a very hard
against and we've had some successes in

245
00:14:03,130 --> 00:14:05,260
and need to talk about that at some
other point

246
00:14:05,260 --> 00:14:09,779
so it's really been stretched to cover a
wide variety of things and

247
00:14:09,779 --> 00:14:14,300
n specifically what I want to focus on
is on section 10:30 a fuck

248
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:18,490
which as you can see on covers a couple
different things

249
00:14:18,490 --> 00:14:24,820
but really the key term is intentionally
causes damage without authorization

250
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:28,579
again you see the term without
authorization %uh appear

251
00:14:28,579 --> 00:14:33,120
throughout this section and the CFAA

252
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:37,190
now the words intentionally causes
damage without authorization to a

253
00:14:37,190 --> 00:14:39,050
protected computers had

254
00:14:39,050 --> 00:14:43,050
a very broad definition as well and I'll
start by saying protected computer

255
00:14:43,050 --> 00:14:46,740
really just means computer that's
connected to the Internet good

256
00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:49,820
now the case I want to focus on

257
00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:53,290
and I'm not apologize cuz I'll you know
I've talked about this case before and

258
00:14:53,290 --> 00:14:54,740
hyper whatever reason

259
00:14:54,740 --> 00:14:58,199
I just cannot say the lobby correctly

260
00:14:58,199 --> 00:15:01,639
gay so by Bucher it I screwed up the
lady okay

261
00:15:01,639 --> 00:15:06,089
a new democrat we thank you I'm but that
was my warning ahead a time right

262
00:15:06,089 --> 00:15:09,740
so in this case am involved

263
00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:14,740
in employment dispute basically across
in was an executive for Delaney

264
00:15:14,740 --> 00:15:18,790
okay good and had basically signed an
agreement where he'd

265
00:15:18,790 --> 00:15:22,199
agreed dad you know he would only use

266
00:15:22,199 --> 00:15:25,470
basically has were computer for work
purposes

267
00:15:25,470 --> 00:15:28,740
you decided to eventually start his own
competing company

268
00:15:28,740 --> 00:15:32,339
and so he you know returned the computer

269
00:15:32,339 --> 00:15:35,680
minus the hard drive the original 100
that was put on so they

270
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:38,769
when they asked a where's the hard ride
this computer came with he said

271
00:15:38,769 --> 00:15:42,649
well I destroyed that one but I copy all
your data

272
00:15:42,649 --> 00:15:45,930
and I put on this new hard drive then
I'm in giving you back

273
00:15:45,930 --> 00:15:49,029
well they didn't like that and so they
sued him

274
00:15:49,029 --> 00:15:54,610
an issue and charging see a big and Basu
to him again under the theory that he

275
00:15:54,610 --> 00:15:59,899
I intentionally cause damage without
authorization a protected computer

276
00:15:59,899 --> 00:16:03,820
okay now what was important was

277
00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:07,529
there's there was a bit of a dispute
over whether

278
00:16:07,529 --> 00:16:10,970
he had truly given back all the
information or not but at least

279
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:14,250
at the point in time with the court was
deciding whether this was a legal can't

280
00:16:14,250 --> 00:16:15,240
be legal claim

281
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:18,329
that could proceed there was

282
00:16:18,329 --> 00:16:22,170
you know the court was less concerned
that and basically said it was another

283
00:16:22,170 --> 00:16:26,079
that he destroyed the hard drive when he
was not authorized to do so because

284
00:16:26,079 --> 00:16:29,709
employment agreements and yet to return
the computer as what's

285
00:16:29,709 --> 00:16:33,300
and um they said the destroying data in
a way that was

286
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:37,209
adverse to the company's interest
specifically because he was leaving

287
00:16:37,209 --> 00:16:41,670
the lady I get is that correct out guess
I did not

288
00:16:41,670 --> 00:16:45,199
okay know yet %uh there we go okay they
read our

289
00:16:45,199 --> 00:16:48,250
because he had destroyed in a way that
was adverse to the company

290
00:16:48,250 --> 00:16:51,360
in other words because he left he was
leaving to go to another company

291
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:56,810
that that was enough to trigger the CFA
so again this is another example of how

292
00:16:56,810 --> 00:17:01,040
you know okay shirt maybe a little bit
obvious you can destroy your

293
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:06,280
you know employers devices by again
there was no actual concrete proof that

294
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:09,439
he had taken stuff he wasn't supposed to
take their was

295
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:12,860
allegations are suspicions but nothing
actually ever concretely

296
00:17:12,860 --> 00:17:17,819
proven okay the good thing I want to
talk about his encryption

297
00:17:17,819 --> 00:17:22,730
alright on and you know encryption is
good security practice

298
00:17:22,730 --> 00:17:26,429
I it's a great way to keep people on
your computer but it's also a way

299
00:17:26,429 --> 00:17:29,539
unfortunately at least under the law to
attract

300
00:17:29,539 --> 00:17:35,900
attention to yourself in not so good
ways noun

301
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:39,419
the obstruction enhancement you see down
there it says USSG lemme

302
00:17:39,419 --> 00:17:42,030
give a little bit a background about
what i'm talking about. so this make

303
00:17:42,030 --> 00:17:43,389
sense basically

304
00:17:43,390 --> 00:17:46,520
the USSG refers to the United States
sensing guidelines

305
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:50,668
whenever a person is and charged with
committing any

306
00:17:50,669 --> 00:17:56,049
federal criminal case a federal crime
soaps the FAA wire fraud whenever maybe

307
00:17:56,049 --> 00:18:00,000
when they are convicted they have to be
sentence then when they are sentenced

308
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,620
the way federal law

309
00:18:01,620 --> 00:18:05,250
dictates the sentence the person
receives is that

310
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:09,900
every criminal statute has a maximum
sentence

311
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:14,130
so for example in the CFAA context the
maximum sentence for some violations and

312
00:18:14,130 --> 00:18:15,280
the CIA

313
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:18,770
is up to five years in prison some
violations at the see a big bitch up to

314
00:18:18,770 --> 00:18:19,770
20 years in prison

315
00:18:19,770 --> 00:18:23,450
okay but how is a judge supposed to
decide

316
00:18:23,450 --> 00:18:26,500
what have a sentence to give someone
does the judge gave twenty years to

317
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:27,120
everybody

318
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:32,480
10 okay he has here she has to decide
where in the spectrum between

319
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:36,770
no jail time in five years where that
spectrum is here she gonna impose

320
00:18:36,770 --> 00:18:38,090
sentence on the defendant

321
00:18:38,090 --> 00:18:41,299
and in order to this make that decision
the judge is required to look at the

322
00:18:41,299 --> 00:18:42,879
United States Sentencing Guidelines

323
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:47,419
with the guidelines are there a large
book that is put together by the United

324
00:18:47,419 --> 00:18:48,890
States ensign Commission

325
00:18:48,890 --> 00:18:52,900
which is a group that's appointed by
congress and they basically

326
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:57,100
decide how serious how much ever
sentence a

327
00:18:57,100 --> 00:19:00,539
those particular defendants posed to get
in the way they make that determination

328
00:19:00,539 --> 00:19:02,340
is it hinges on two things

329
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:05,770
first that hinges on the defendant's
criminal record so the defendant has

330
00:19:05,770 --> 00:19:07,700
previously been convicted of crimes

331
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:11,720
you'll have a higher sentence I'm and
the second factor is

332
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:16,650
it looks at the severity of the crime
what it does is it creates a scale

333
00:19:16,650 --> 00:19:21,419
from 1 to 43 forty-three the most
serious crimes murder someone you had a

334
00:19:21,419 --> 00:19:22,210
43

335
00:19:22,210 --> 00:19:27,350
okay as simple possession herb marijuana
you can add to joins your pocket that's

336
00:19:27,350 --> 00:19:31,110
you know gonna be on the much lower side
is back to maybe at three or four

337
00:19:31,110 --> 00:19:34,860
well there's person at the aid type
crimes against a little bit complicated

338
00:19:34,860 --> 00:19:36,350
I won't go into it but

339
00:19:36,350 --> 00:19:40,039
suffice it to say there's a numbered and
I think it starts at about 10

340
00:19:40,039 --> 00:19:43,480
any can go up depending on the
circumstance

341
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:46,679
anyway in addition to calculating how
serious that

342
00:19:46,679 --> 00:19:50,260
individual crime is based on the statue
you're convicted up

343
00:19:50,260 --> 00:19:53,629
the guidelines also have certain things
called enhancements

344
00:19:53,630 --> 00:19:56,720
basically ways that you get extra points

345
00:19:56,720 --> 00:20:01,350
on this one through 43 scale based on
the way you committed your crime

346
00:20:01,350 --> 00:20:05,220
one of those enhancements is the
obstruction of justice and handsome

347
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:10,110
okay that said that if the defendant
willfully obstructed or impeded

348
00:20:10,110 --> 00:20:14,090
you know it centered centered said Ron
he gets she gets a two-level increase

349
00:20:14,090 --> 00:20:17,559
in his crime for her crime okay now the
good news is

350
00:20:17,559 --> 00:20:21,549
that this at specific enhancement the
one that's up on the screen

351
00:20:21,549 --> 00:20:25,960
does not apply to the crime and
anticipatory obstruction of justice

352
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:29,400
unless the obstruction occurs

353
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:34,179
on in relation to a prosecution and the
anticipatory instruction adjusters

354
00:20:34,179 --> 00:20:37,179
charge what that means is you can't get
it twice

355
00:20:37,179 --> 00:20:41,570
okay so if you're charged with
anticipatory obstruction of justice you

356
00:20:41,570 --> 00:20:42,668
can also get

357
00:20:42,669 --> 00:20:46,190
the enhancement for anticipatory Lee
instructing justice

358
00:20:46,190 --> 00:20:50,409
okay now

359
00:20:50,409 --> 00:20:54,510
unfortunately encryption has been
considered obstruction

360
00:20:54,510 --> 00:20:58,669
and in the case that cited here the
court found the obstruction of justice

361
00:20:58,669 --> 00:21:01,830
and has been was appropriate for a a
defendant who

362
00:21:01,830 --> 00:21:06,570
changed encryption keys used
sophisticates is the court's words used

363
00:21:06,570 --> 00:21:09,428
sophisticated computer file swapping
techniques

364
00:21:09,429 --> 00:21:12,720
requiring special instructions to
reassemble files

365
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:15,799
and used special software programs that
could lock down a computer

366
00:21:15,799 --> 00:21:19,010
wipe it clean now what's important for
our purposes

367
00:21:19,010 --> 00:21:22,200
is that it didn't matter if this was
done before the

368
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:28,220
actual crime occur okay the guidelines
cover obstructed conduct that occurs

369
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:31,059
before this started the investigation

370
00:21:31,059 --> 00:21:34,270
occur so this is one example how

371
00:21:34,270 --> 00:21:37,730
you could potentially get in trouble are
getting in hand sentence

372
00:21:37,730 --> 00:21:41,690
under criminal law up for using
encryption

373
00:21:41,690 --> 00:21:45,630
encryption as a special skill basically
it is a nother section at the guidelines

374
00:21:45,630 --> 00:21:50,419
said the defendant uses special skill in
a manner that significantly facilitated

375
00:21:50,419 --> 00:21:54,140
the Commissioner concealment and the
offense you get a two-level enhancement

376
00:21:54,140 --> 00:21:57,640
now when they def when the guidelines
define special skill

377
00:21:57,640 --> 00:22:02,220
they say well a skill not possessed by
members and the general public

378
00:22:02,220 --> 00:22:05,460
and usually requiring substantial
education training or

379
00:22:05,460 --> 00:22:08,750
training or licensing end quote the
examples it gives

380
00:22:08,750 --> 00:22:12,590
our pilots lawyers doctors accountants

381
00:22:12,590 --> 00:22:18,619
chemists and for whatever reason
demolition experts became

382
00:22:18,619 --> 00:22:20,399
alright so this this is what

383
00:22:20,399 --> 00:22:23,470
the guidelines used to define a special
skill well guess what

384
00:22:23,470 --> 00:22:26,700
I love you encrypt is up there you are
special people because

385
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:29,899
encryption has been found to be a
special skill you're effectively the

386
00:22:29,899 --> 00:22:31,830
equivalent of a doctor or lawyer

387
00:22:31,830 --> 00:22:35,879
and I guess demolitions expert makes a
little bit of sense am

388
00:22:35,879 --> 00:22:39,779
again in both these cases the use of
encryption

389
00:22:39,779 --> 00:22:44,100
was considered away to facilitate the
commission and the crime

390
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:47,330
and again like the obstruction
enhancement the timing doesn't matter

391
00:22:47,330 --> 00:22:51,309
okay and think about that for a second
work waiting encryption

392
00:22:51,309 --> 00:22:55,899
with being a doctor well who goes to
medical school to commit a crime

393
00:22:55,899 --> 00:23:00,779
in the future not allotted maybe
somebody does right but I'm a lawyer I

394
00:23:00,779 --> 00:23:02,470
didn't go to law school to

395
00:23:02,470 --> 00:23:06,009
you know a potentially use my legal
skills to facilitate the commission at

396
00:23:06,009 --> 00:23:06,799
my crime

397
00:23:06,799 --> 00:23:10,570
okay but you know when you think I'm
encryption people who take

398
00:23:10,570 --> 00:23:13,879
you know perhaps you take you know I'm
sure a lot of people as audience

399
00:23:13,879 --> 00:23:17,039
regularly encrypt everything that they
do well the court doesn't distinguish

400
00:23:17,039 --> 00:23:18,070
between

401
00:23:18,070 --> 00:23:21,809
you know why or how or when you order
incur

402
00:23:21,809 --> 00:23:24,970
and I think this goes really to deep

403
00:23:24,970 --> 00:23:28,600
a problem in the legal field in that

404
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:32,259
quarter only very slowly beginning to
catch

405
00:23:32,259 --> 00:23:35,970
up with the fact that encryption is not
just the way for criminals to get away

406
00:23:35,970 --> 00:23:37,559
with hiding what they're doing

407
00:23:37,559 --> 00:23:41,168
because thats the kinda implicit

408
00:23:41,169 --> 00:23:44,450
suggestion that the court has

409
00:23:44,450 --> 00:23:47,759
backwards and entertain for a while I

410
00:23:47,759 --> 00:23:51,139
I mention that as a segue to talk very
briefly

411
00:23:51,139 --> 00:23:56,759
about encryption in the fifth amendment
and this is a whole separate talk

412
00:23:56,759 --> 00:24:00,619
that could be done for an hour but I
wanna flag this issue briefly because

413
00:24:00,619 --> 00:24:02,299
this is another way in which

414
00:24:02,299 --> 00:24:05,690
you can find yourself in a little bit of
trouble om

415
00:24:05,690 --> 00:24:09,159
for encrypting now the scenario usually
goes like this:

416
00:24:09,159 --> 00:24:12,379
cops get a search warrant they get your
computer

417
00:24:12,379 --> 00:24:17,519
it's encrypted Cade they can't break the
encryption may ask you for the password

418
00:24:17,519 --> 00:24:21,649
if you're smart you have a lawyer his
namesake I'm not giving anything

419
00:24:21,649 --> 00:24:24,679
so now what well

420
00:24:24,679 --> 00:24:28,619
there have been a few not many but a few
cases where

421
00:24:28,619 --> 00:24:32,720
the government has basically gone to the
court and the judge is a judge

422
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:36,899
we got a problem we got a search warrant
which means really girly allowed to be

423
00:24:36,899 --> 00:24:37,940
in a computer

424
00:24:37,940 --> 00:24:41,330
and we won a search that computer which
you've already said we can do

425
00:24:41,330 --> 00:24:45,439
but we can't because it included and we
can break it so we need you to

426
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:49,039
ordered the person 2d crib his computer
her computer

427
00:24:49,039 --> 00:24:52,429
now the fifth amendment to the
Constitution generally

428
00:24:52,429 --> 00:24:55,509
protects us from being %uh forced

429
00:24:55,509 --> 00:24:59,249
to testify against ourselves arm and the
key is

430
00:24:59,249 --> 00:25:02,749
it has to be both has to be both
compulsion that means you have to be

431
00:25:02,749 --> 00:25:03,369
forced

432
00:25:03,369 --> 00:25:07,549
to do something and has to be testimony
and there've been a few cases

433
00:25:07,549 --> 00:25:11,369
that talked about whether d cribbing is
testimony

434
00:25:11,369 --> 00:25:16,340
okay maybe and I and being a probably
people heard another case in Ramona for

435
00:25:16,340 --> 00:25:17,499
QoS who this was a

436
00:25:17,499 --> 00:25:20,840
person and yet bath held out with an
amicus brief

437
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:25,350
was a case where I she was under
indictment for

438
00:25:25,350 --> 00:25:28,590
on wire fraud in mortgage fraud and

439
00:25:28,590 --> 00:25:31,799
cops got a search warrant they searched
the house they found a bunch computers

440
00:25:31,799 --> 00:25:32,499
they had the

441
00:25:32,499 --> 00:25:36,279
you know this kinda deboer roadblock
computer was incredibly they couldn't

442
00:25:36,279 --> 00:25:36,950
get into it

443
00:25:36,950 --> 00:25:40,450
and so they went to the corn said we
want you to force miss for cuz it'd be

444
00:25:40,450 --> 00:25:41,480
cryptic computer

445
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:44,570
but she said no I have had the men in
right not to do that

446
00:25:44,570 --> 00:25:49,129
that we agree and we bout amicus brief
said yeah judge you can force her to do

447
00:25:49,129 --> 00:25:49,609
this

448
00:25:49,609 --> 00:25:52,879
and so then the court had to decide the
issue an accord unfortunately

449
00:25:52,879 --> 00:25:56,859
decided that well no yet she has to
degrade

450
00:25:56,859 --> 00:25:59,960
and in its holding was very factually
based

451
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:03,529
basically prior to

452
00:26:03,529 --> 00:26:08,789
right after the search for happened and
missed because you went on the telephone

453
00:26:08,789 --> 00:26:10,669
and talk to her ex-husband

454
00:26:10,669 --> 00:26:14,099
and codefendant who happened to be
incarcerated and that's how it is

455
00:26:14,099 --> 00:26:17,149
those recorded as everyone as anyone
who's ever been in a jail with no

456
00:26:17,149 --> 00:26:20,549
and on the phone call she headed you
know implicitly

457
00:26:20,549 --> 00:26:24,429
and suggested that she the computer was
hers

458
00:26:24,429 --> 00:26:28,340
and that she had in cryptid and what
that meant for the judge was well

459
00:26:28,340 --> 00:26:29,840
because I backpacked

460
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:33,669
the apt to be Christians not testimony
because the government already knows

461
00:26:33,669 --> 00:26:34,659
that it's her computer

462
00:26:34,659 --> 00:26:37,659
an editor not that she you know it

463
00:26:37,659 --> 00:26:41,609
is the one who is able to the crib now
in the for QoS in case the government

464
00:26:41,609 --> 00:26:43,668
made argument that look the only

465
00:26:43,669 --> 00:26:47,840
people who use encryption are people who
are trying to hide what they're doing

466
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:51,029
and the judge did not really address
that issue

467
00:26:51,029 --> 00:26:54,879
but it lingered later

468
00:26:54,879 --> 00:26:58,279
and allude a short while afterwards
another case came out

469
00:26:58,279 --> 00:27:02,309
on the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals it
was a case called

470
00:27:02,309 --> 00:27:06,519
in regards the grand jury subpoena arm
all refer to the client the

471
00:27:06,519 --> 00:27:10,289
the opinion refers to the client as John
Doe so in that case very similar

472
00:27:10,289 --> 00:27:11,429
situation

473
00:27:11,429 --> 00:27:15,330
Joe had a bunch a computer seized from
hotel room

474
00:27:15,330 --> 00:27:19,899
as subject to search warrant may again
hit encryption standards TrueCrypt

475
00:27:19,899 --> 00:27:23,889
and their number Hien volumes the
they're fed the forensic examiner the

476
00:27:23,889 --> 00:27:25,190
feds had

477
00:27:25,190 --> 00:27:30,309
was not very good and was not able to
tell you know what was on the computer

478
00:27:30,309 --> 00:27:33,369
was not on the computer you know if they
had in volumes

479
00:27:33,369 --> 00:27:38,779
had anything on them but with the
Eleventh Circuit found in that case was

480
00:27:38,779 --> 00:27:43,549
that doe did have a fifth Amendment
right not to be crept in so it

481
00:27:43,549 --> 00:27:46,720
held that he shouldn't be forced to the
crib now importantly

482
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:51,899
be 11 circuit said well we are not
persuaded by the suggestion that simply

483
00:27:51,899 --> 00:27:53,859
because the devices were in cryptid

484
00:27:53,859 --> 00:27:57,330
necessarily means that Joe was trying to
hide something

485
00:27:57,330 --> 00:28:00,559
just as a vault is capable of storing
mountains and incriminating documents

486
00:28:00,559 --> 00:28:03,349
that alone does not mean that it
contains incriminating

487
00:28:03,349 --> 00:28:06,408
incriminating documents or anything at
all and quite so this is

488
00:28:06,409 --> 00:28:09,789
good language in the fight to come about

489
00:28:09,789 --> 00:28:13,539
debunking this government argument that
they've tried to make

490
00:28:13,539 --> 00:28:16,629
which is decryption equals Criner

491
00:28:16,629 --> 00:28:20,269
K and we've they had a published 11
Circuit opinion really the first

492
00:28:20,269 --> 00:28:22,309
appellate court to decide this issue

493
00:28:22,309 --> 00:28:25,619
to come out and see something this
strong is a very good

494
00:28:25,619 --> 00:28:29,490
sign for you all who encrypt okay

495
00:28:29,490 --> 00:28:33,639
so and I'm getting almost at the end
we're gonna talk about ways to protect

496
00:28:33,639 --> 00:28:36,049
ourselves and then we can get to some
questions

497
00:28:36,049 --> 00:28:40,320
protect yourself disclaimer This Is my
chance again to remind you

498
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:43,240
that even though I'm a lawyer and I'm
talking about the law I'm not giving

499
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:44,570
legal advice

500
00:28:44,570 --> 00:28:49,279
and these are just suggestions they're
not guaranteed to work

501
00:28:49,279 --> 00:28:53,029
I if they don't work don't common call
me and say any for Korea the year there

502
00:28:53,029 --> 00:28:54,589
said that this would work in their

503
00:28:54,589 --> 00:28:57,908
that's not a defense so please you know

504
00:28:57,909 --> 00:29:01,389
take that with a grain of salt and you
know these are just some

505
00:29:01,389 --> 00:29:04,379
suggestions so my person just as you
should go tomorrow morning this is a

506
00:29:04,379 --> 00:29:05,309
shameless plug

507
00:29:05,309 --> 00:29:09,158
okay I'll go tomorrow morning at 11 a.m.
in room Dennis to hear Marcia Hofmann

508
00:29:09,159 --> 00:29:12,499
senior yet a staff attorney should be
talking about protecting your data from

509
00:29:12,499 --> 00:29:13,220
the cops

510
00:29:13,220 --> 00:29:16,629
so you gonna get some great tips about
how you can keep your data

511
00:29:16,629 --> 00:29:19,710
3 and hopefully avoid some of these
problems

512
00:29:19,710 --> 00:29:24,419
but let's say you sleep in beer slacker
you don't go to the park what can you do

513
00:29:24,419 --> 00:29:28,029
okay well the first thing is

514
00:29:28,029 --> 00:29:32,169
a retention policy now retention
policies again

515
00:29:32,169 --> 00:29:35,179
add you know this is easy for a company
did

516
00:29:35,179 --> 00:29:39,899
right om and it has to be in place
before something happens and has to be

517
00:29:39,899 --> 00:29:41,820
coherent consistently applied

518
00:29:41,820 --> 00:29:46,039
and routinely followed okay what good is
the retention policy well

519
00:29:46,039 --> 00:29:49,169
water retention policy is going to do is
it's going to

520
00:29:49,169 --> 00:29:53,070
negate or at least counter

521
00:29:53,070 --> 00:29:56,158
any argument that the reason you
destroyed something

522
00:29:56,159 --> 00:29:59,909
was because you're intending to obstruct
justice are you anticipated

523
00:29:59,909 --> 00:30:03,440
anticipating that you're going to be
instructing some future proceeding that

524
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:04,749
could potentially happen

525
00:30:04,749 --> 00:30:08,950
cuz he say look company believes
everything after three months

526
00:30:08,950 --> 00:30:12,029
period I didn't deleted because I
thought I was gonna be in trouble but

527
00:30:12,029 --> 00:30:13,960
because that's what we always do

528
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:19,200
your you got a good argument again this
is not an absolute defense but this is

529
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:20,289
just a suggestion

530
00:30:20,289 --> 00:30:24,158
now you're probably thinking okay pani
that's great

531
00:30:24,159 --> 00:30:27,460
you know I work for a company they have
retention policy that's fine but what

532
00:30:27,460 --> 00:30:29,929
about if it's just me

533
00:30:29,929 --> 00:30:33,080
when I'm I supposed to do I am I
supposed to have a retention policy at

534
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:35,178
home from my home computer

535
00:30:35,179 --> 00:30:39,159
gay well the answer is yeah sure why not
I guess I would work

536
00:30:39,159 --> 00:30:42,259
you could definitely do that on harder
to prove

537
00:30:42,259 --> 00:30:47,019
harder to exercise but that's that's a
possibility are but I think

538
00:30:47,019 --> 00:30:50,789
you should think seriously about not
creating the date in the first place

539
00:30:50,789 --> 00:30:54,149
so I'll whether that means eternal logs
you

540
00:30:54,149 --> 00:30:57,740
create you know you use encryption in a
way where you may be

541
00:30:57,740 --> 00:31:01,159
you know I don't know and well

542
00:31:01,159 --> 00:31:04,759
I think this way yet the think about
ways where you don't create a paper

543
00:31:04,759 --> 00:31:07,190
trail in the first place because if you
don't read a paper trail

544
00:31:07,190 --> 00:31:09,700
knots trying anything because nothing
exists and if you're not destroying

545
00:31:09,700 --> 00:31:10,269
anything

546
00:31:10,269 --> 00:31:14,429
you can't get in trouble for destroying
'em

547
00:31:14,429 --> 00:31:17,750
back to the the the retention policy per
second

548
00:31:17,750 --> 00:31:21,799
that really again its easy when you
thinking about what to keep

549
00:31:21,799 --> 00:31:24,960
it's harder when you thinking again
about deletion and encryption so

550
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:28,859
whatever you do you have to be very
careful because I think as these cases

551
00:31:28,859 --> 00:31:30,319
the mall shown

552
00:31:30,319 --> 00:31:33,649
especially the kernel case its it's
another

553
00:31:33,649 --> 00:31:38,609
if you think you're getting in trouble
or you think that this document or this

554
00:31:38,609 --> 00:31:42,639
email or whatever it may be is something
that someone may be interested in

555
00:31:42,639 --> 00:31:46,829
in the future so you have to be very
very careful

556
00:31:46,829 --> 00:31:50,168
to make sure that you don't find urself
in trouble okay

557
00:31:50,169 --> 00:31:54,559
with that I'm gonna open it up for
questions again name same disclaimer

558
00:31:54,559 --> 00:31:57,779
please do not tell me your specific
legal situation

559
00:31:57,779 --> 00:32:01,589
do not give me sensitive personal
information on your going away the

560
00:32:01,589 --> 00:32:04,599
attorney-client privilege if we do that
but I am happy to answer any questions

561
00:32:04,599 --> 00:32:08,019
and then again my email if you wanna
talk privately

562
00:32:08,019 --> 00:32:12,829
that's me on twitter and ended any these
issues come up please feel free to come

563
00:32:12,829 --> 00:32:13,299
by

564
00:32:13,299 --> 00:32:18,779
and doctors at the EFTPOS artsy counter
help so without its open for questions

565
00:32:18,779 --> 00:32:23,609
hi I was wondering if you had maybe like
a crime job that would run

566
00:32:23,609 --> 00:32:27,329
every day and delete everything in a
certain director there was over 90 days

567
00:32:27,329 --> 00:32:32,299
if that would hold weight as a person
not be no personal document retention

568
00:32:32,299 --> 00:32:33,230
policy

569
00:32:33,230 --> 00:32:36,909
I the courts and I think if you can
demonstrate

570
00:32:36,909 --> 00:32:40,970
that again going back to these policy
the principles that its

571
00:32:40,970 --> 00:32:44,399
let's let their bennett's coherent
consistently applied routinely

572
00:32:44,399 --> 00:32:47,740
followed i think thats thats that is a
way

573
00:32:47,740 --> 00:32:50,740
again I can guarantee that that's the
way but yes I think that's something

574
00:32:50,740 --> 00:32:51,679
that you could

575
00:32:51,679 --> 00:32:55,399
just think about now it goes back to the
idea behind them

576
00:32:55,399 --> 00:32:58,529
bob was foreseeable like let's say you
have that

577
00:32:58,529 --> 00:33:02,019
to delete all their child porn files you
consistently download every day

578
00:33:02,019 --> 00:33:05,769
okay well that marlin sabu because you
should know he should have that system

579
00:33:05,769 --> 00:33:08,869
but it is just about your routine stuff
that you have

580
00:33:08,869 --> 00:33:12,629
emails you have going through a personal
e-mails or web sites you visit your

581
00:33:12,629 --> 00:33:15,710
whatever it may be yes i think thats a
it's a good way to it

582
00:33:15,710 --> 00:33:20,589
the counter

583
00:33:20,589 --> 00:33:23,769
I'm in the kernel case if you'd gone
online

584
00:33:23,769 --> 00:33:27,149
in instead said I didn't find anything
good I just got rid of it

585
00:33:27,149 --> 00:33:31,470
you think you woulda gotten away oh man
I have no idea

586
00:33:31,470 --> 00:33:34,710
on probably not

587
00:33:34,710 --> 00:33:38,569
I mean I I think under the government's
theory the crime was

588
00:33:38,569 --> 00:33:42,789
that Dec one other things the court
hinged

589
00:33:42,789 --> 00:33:46,210
a lot of its decision on is that like

590
00:33:46,210 --> 00:33:49,519
you had in this the vice president's
candidates

591
00:33:49,519 --> 00:33:52,950
email like you should know that this is
going

592
00:33:52,950 --> 00:33:56,579
that this is going to attract the
attention of the FBI now

593
00:33:56,579 --> 00:34:01,019
baby got around the black an actual
knowledge by pointing to the fact that

594
00:34:01,019 --> 00:34:03,059
his comments that

595
00:34:03,059 --> 00:34:07,829
he expressly said what everyone is kinda
implicitly thinking which is

596
00:34:07,829 --> 00:34:12,119
shit did you get in trouble for this and
so yeah that was

597
00:34:12,119 --> 00:34:17,440
concrete proof on his mines date but I
think even if he had said

598
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:20,990
i deleted everything I'm not really
worried I think they were still argued

599
00:34:20,990 --> 00:34:21,240
look

600
00:34:21,240 --> 00:34:27,690
anybody would know that this was
problematic so

601
00:34:27,690 --> 00:34:32,168
in Mia the kernel case you mention that
he gotten the most trouble

602
00:34:32,168 --> 00:34:35,908
for on for the obstruction the
anticipatory

603
00:34:35,909 --> 00:34:39,149
Tory obstruction of justice bride

604
00:34:39,149 --> 00:34:43,819
do you think had he not obstructed
justice

605
00:34:43,819 --> 00:34:48,440
he woulda gotten in more trouble because
he was found guilty of greater crimes

606
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:49,460
than he was

607
00:34:49,460 --> 00:34:52,599
well actually in in a again with that

608
00:34:52,599 --> 00:34:57,400
since I'm can you know as best as I can
gas

609
00:34:57,400 --> 00:35:00,369
I would think there's a good argument
that he wouldn't have gone as much in as

610
00:35:00,369 --> 00:35:01,109
much trouble

611
00:35:01,109 --> 00:35:04,690
because if you think about it you as
acquitted a

612
00:35:04,690 --> 00:35:09,160
and I was getting confused lemme people
in a big specifically

613
00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:13,470
he was he quitted a wire fraud that's
the most serious crime he was charged

614
00:35:13,470 --> 00:35:16,359
and the the most serious matter
management so he was acquitted on the

615
00:35:16,359 --> 00:35:17,328
wire fraud

616
00:35:17,329 --> 00:35:20,680
yet a hung jury on the and

617
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:24,029
ID theft okay demand that the government
could convince twelve people to

618
00:35:24,029 --> 00:35:26,420
unanimously agreed that he'd committed

619
00:35:26,420 --> 00:35:30,099
I identity theft am and I don't mean I
don't know the split was you know

620
00:35:30,099 --> 00:35:33,099
an 11.1% split is different than a 75
split but

621
00:35:33,099 --> 00:35:36,759
let's say for the sake of argument that
all things being equal they couldn't

622
00:35:36,759 --> 00:35:40,299
you know maybe they had a mistrial on ID
there and he was guilty of the

623
00:35:40,299 --> 00:35:44,310
misdemeanor CFAA which basically just
criminalizes

624
00:35:44,310 --> 00:35:47,560
you know basically the intrusion on the
E entering into the email without

625
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:49,009
necessarily causing alterna

626
00:35:49,009 --> 00:35:52,339
damage if you really think about it at
they taking away the anticipatory

627
00:35:52,339 --> 00:35:55,049
instruction in justice charges have been
guilty to misdemeanor

628
00:35:55,049 --> 00:35:58,380
instead he got convicted on the felony
and in the 12 months in jail but do you

629
00:35:58,380 --> 00:36:00,859
think you would have been found guilty
of the wire fraud

630
00:36:00,859 --> 00:36:04,040
if that evidence had existed I'll

631
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:07,579
I don't think so because they were still
able to get into evidence

632
00:36:07,579 --> 00:36:11,060
all this stuff that he said he deadbeat

633
00:36:11,060 --> 00:36:15,549
the all the stuff you got because they
at a paper trail him talking about it

634
00:36:15,549 --> 00:36:18,980
but yes I don't think he i don't think
the actual evidence itself was really

635
00:36:18,980 --> 00:36:20,200
that significant

636
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:23,910
and that kinda goes back to the original
point in traditional obstruction of

637
00:36:23,910 --> 00:36:24,680
justice

638
00:36:24,680 --> 00:36:29,868
this requirement avonex is is what helps
ensure that whatever it is that is being

639
00:36:29,869 --> 00:36:31,849
destroyed is actually important

640
00:36:31,849 --> 00:36:35,440
to the truth-seeking function if you
will

641
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:39,299
I'll a criminal investigation we hear
these documents

642
00:36:39,299 --> 00:36:42,460
a picture Bristol Palin is not going to
help the government proved that he

643
00:36:42,460 --> 00:36:43,069
committed

644
00:36:43,069 --> 00:36:46,680
wire fraud the fraud is in that he
attempted to enter into the computer

645
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:47,940
pretending to be circular

646
00:36:47,940 --> 00:36:51,109
so I don't think that the evidence that
he deleted was all that important in a

647
00:36:51,109 --> 00:36:52,730
in the case in the long run

648
00:36:52,730 --> 00:36:56,589
thank you great talk the gym

649
00:36:56,589 --> 00:37:00,279
I just have a two part question here
first is

650
00:37:00,279 --> 00:37:04,529
do you think that very soon we're going
to see a conflict between the

651
00:37:04,529 --> 00:37:08,060
John Doe case that you decided the
kernel case because it seems like that

652
00:37:08,060 --> 00:37:10,790
in interpretation encryption is in
direct conflict with the

653
00:37:10,790 --> 00:37:15,150
and two-story obstruction of justice and
the second is it has

654
00:37:15,150 --> 00:37:19,190
plausible deniability in the case have
hidden volumes Hidden Creek to buy in

655
00:37:19,190 --> 00:37:22,829
specifically been tested in any real way
in the courts

656
00:37:22,829 --> 00:37:26,680
so sign in with your second question I
don't know many cases that have dealt

657
00:37:26,680 --> 00:37:27,399
with it

658
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:31,500
a.m. and you know explicitly

659
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:35,339
so I don't know I'm sure that they're
gonna be other situations where that

660
00:37:35,339 --> 00:37:35,980
comes up

661
00:37:35,980 --> 00:37:39,450
but I can't think of any off the top of
my head that are current

662
00:37:39,450 --> 00:37:43,759
n in respect your first question I think

663
00:37:43,759 --> 00:37:48,920
the underlying concepts a kind of
conflict but it's important to remember

664
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:51,569
that the John Doe case dealt with

665
00:37:51,569 --> 00:37:54,650
the fifth amendment to the US
Constitution in the criminal case dealt

666
00:37:54,650 --> 00:37:56,299
with the statute and so

667
00:37:56,299 --> 00:37:59,880
to send extent the law that they were
both interpreting is

668
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:03,950
different so you know the laws wanted
this quirky things where

669
00:38:03,950 --> 00:38:08,880
right make sense in one what makes sense
for one legal theory doesn't necessarily

670
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:12,960
hold true in another legal theory but I
think the implicit understanding this

671
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:14,400
idea that

672
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:18,430
look just because you take steps to
protect yourself doesn't mean your

673
00:38:18,430 --> 00:38:19,700
criminal

674
00:38:19,700 --> 00:38:22,900
on is the is a good one

675
00:38:22,900 --> 00:38:26,230
that the dough case realized

676
00:38:26,230 --> 00:38:30,430
and hopefully other courts even looking
at maybe a situation I colonels case in

677
00:38:30,430 --> 00:38:31,210
the future

678
00:38:31,210 --> 00:38:34,670
can look and say look we'd we we treat
computer security

679
00:38:34,670 --> 00:38:38,210
as an assessee today you know yesterday
%ah who

680
00:38:38,210 --> 00:38:42,960
at all it's a emails passwords stolen I
400,000 passage whatever

681
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:46,380
every day we hearing about security
threats

682
00:38:46,380 --> 00:38:52,650
and the fact that people take steps that
years ago may be considered

683
00:38:52,650 --> 00:38:57,210
unique or only for a very technical
sophisticated people

684
00:38:57,210 --> 00:39:01,250
isn't really no longer the case and that
technology has advanced in a way we're

685
00:39:01,250 --> 00:39:01,920
even

686
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:06,400
casual computer users are you know less
technically savvy people that maybe the

687
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:07,640
people here today

688
00:39:07,640 --> 00:39:11,368
are starting to take advantage %uh these
tools designed to protect their security

689
00:39:11,369 --> 00:39:12,000
and safety

690
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:15,460
but so we may see it under the umbrella
but at the moment I'm tonight maybe

691
00:39:15,460 --> 00:39:19,839
that night thank you Jeter

692
00:39:19,839 --> 00:39:23,650
you probably just answer my question but
OK is something like

693
00:39:23,650 --> 00:39:27,930
using a torch browser or encrypting a
basic encrypting your modem

694
00:39:27,930 --> 00:39:31,319
grounds another in any experience you
had four

695
00:39:31,319 --> 00:39:36,580
investigation or any type of criminal
action just that alone without any data

696
00:39:36,580 --> 00:39:38,040
back you up the fact that you

697
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:41,080
I mean it's pretty much you know I guess
so I'm

698
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:43,930
I haven't seen again just because I
haven't seen it doesn't mean it doesn't

699
00:39:43,930 --> 00:39:45,580
exist but I haven't seen anyone

700
00:39:45,580 --> 00:39:48,719
be charged like criminally

701
00:39:48,719 --> 00:39:53,690
with a crime on the basis and the fact
they've used like a twig zina for

702
00:39:53,690 --> 00:39:55,150
example but

703
00:39:55,150 --> 00:39:58,989
I have seen many times the cops coming

704
00:39:58,989 --> 00:40:03,509
to the twiggs at No operators house and
saying

705
00:40:03,509 --> 00:40:07,140
we found child porn associated with this
IP address

706
00:40:07,140 --> 00:40:10,200
and that's your IP address and so what's
going on

707
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:13,710
and you know I think the feds are
starting to

708
00:40:13,710 --> 00:40:17,040
understand how it works better and so

709
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:21,290
often times when I've done as I said
have you heard about were and they go

710
00:40:21,290 --> 00:40:24,759
okay and then they go turn around
somewhere else so I need

711
00:40:24,759 --> 00:40:28,469
I've seen in that context more than i've
seen in in ID in the sense that people

712
00:40:28,469 --> 00:40:29,960
are being

713
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:33,900
you know held accountable like rim lease
like being held criminally accountable

714
00:40:33,900 --> 00:40:36,640
for stuff that's coming out at the end

715
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:40,660
eggs in a but in general using the
browser if it's not for anything illegal

716
00:40:40,660 --> 00:40:41,089
is not

717
00:40:41,089 --> 00:40:44,910
could draw attention to you or dad could
be cause for investigation even if there

718
00:40:44,910 --> 00:40:48,390
was no legal i mean let's say you were
just researching bicycles you just don't

719
00:40:48,390 --> 00:40:51,000
for one who will turn hosiery you know
my

720
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:54,969
I doubt it arm every individual case
would be

721
00:40:54,969 --> 00:40:59,400
unique but I would be less concerned
with that rather than like to examine

722
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:00,630
situation

723
00:41:00,630 --> 00:41:04,950
now and not the answer too much at well
not exactly the exit known being like

724
00:41:04,950 --> 00:41:09,040
likely run an exit node and then they
must come because you that I D address

725
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:12,739
write the date down the IP address that
you're running head: came back to jail

726
00:41:12,739 --> 00:41:14,430
for something

727
00:41:14,430 --> 00:41:18,750
I bank check reader

728
00:41:18,750 --> 00:41:21,969
actually has to do with infection as
well arm what about with

729
00:41:21,969 --> 00:41:25,130
I guess it's a shame to drain away
corporations who have policies in place

730
00:41:25,130 --> 00:41:26,150
to

731
00:41:26,150 --> 00:41:29,330
for instance full disk encryption or
drive locker where

732
00:41:29,330 --> 00:41:33,230
employees have to incur their hardware
because it may be trade secrets sir

733
00:41:33,230 --> 00:41:37,480
company infant information that they
don't want their competitors to get

734
00:41:37,480 --> 00:41:41,980
I'm usually like corporation do this to
prevent a laptop if he gets lost

735
00:41:41,980 --> 00:41:46,839
from somebody picking up using it I mean
what happens in the case let's say an

736
00:41:46,839 --> 00:41:47,700
employee might

737
00:41:47,700 --> 00:41:52,080
do something company doesn't now company
might not have the password

738
00:41:52,080 --> 00:41:57,219
the person might not give it up I what
would happen in a case like that

739
00:41:57,219 --> 00:42:00,680
well again I could I can pretend said

740
00:42:00,680 --> 00:42:04,149
I'm every factual situation be different
but I will be unique but I think your

741
00:42:04,150 --> 00:42:04,480
for

742
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:08,000
the kind of the first things started
with talking about how companies are now

743
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:11,049
you know routinely use encryption I
think goes back to the point that the

744
00:42:11,049 --> 00:42:12,450
Eleventh Circuit made

745
00:42:12,450 --> 00:42:17,680
am he and his idea dad just the factors
encryption doesn't mean that a person's

746
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:18,390
actual criminal

747
00:42:18,390 --> 00:42:21,239
in the morning samples we have that the
better we'll be able to impact the lot

748
00:42:21,239 --> 00:42:23,099
now P enter into a situation

749
00:42:23,099 --> 00:42:27,420
where but simply does something yeah
communist know about it

750
00:42:27,420 --> 00:42:30,799
right well there's a there's a number of
things that come into play with that the

751
00:42:30,799 --> 00:42:32,359
first lady let's see how Mike

752
00:42:32,359 --> 00:42:35,900
if your employer agreement says you
gotta cooperate with the

753
00:42:35,900 --> 00:42:39,200
beds for example okay I've never seen
one that does amber maybe and maybe

754
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:40,560
there are some other that does

755
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:44,219
then you've got in issue there and
that's going to be a employee-employer

756
00:42:44,219 --> 00:42:45,369
issue

757
00:42:45,369 --> 00:42:48,529
now the fifth amendment really only
comes into play

758
00:42:48,529 --> 00:42:52,790
if what you are yard testimony will be

759
00:42:52,790 --> 00:42:56,359
will be incrimination so it's like

760
00:42:56,359 --> 00:42:59,770
it there's no chance that you're gonna
be incriminated by the Act and

761
00:42:59,770 --> 00:43:01,750
decryption you're not protected by that
that the men

762
00:43:01,750 --> 00:43:05,869
now then that goes back to his idea that
it's gonna really depend on the

763
00:43:05,869 --> 00:43:06,450
situation

764
00:43:06,450 --> 00:43:08,890
it you know you don't want to decrease
because you're afraid they're gonna

765
00:43:08,890 --> 00:43:10,690
final is bad stuff you did then

766
00:43:10,690 --> 00:43:13,730
you got arguably some to the memory
protection

767
00:43:13,730 --> 00:43:16,790
and you the court would have to go
through the analysis there if it's not

768
00:43:16,790 --> 00:43:18,589
going to be incriminating then

769
00:43:18,589 --> 00:43:20,859
you know there's gonna be a good
argument that you're not protected by

770
00:43:20,859 --> 00:43:23,069
the fifth amendment and it's going to be
a harder sell

771
00:43:23,069 --> 00:43:27,259
case but I guess the second part was
like with the corporation aspect of

772
00:43:27,259 --> 00:43:28,680
things

773
00:43:28,680 --> 00:43:32,330
where like I'm trying to figure out how
to explain exactly like

774
00:43:32,330 --> 00:43:36,310
if the Inc employer gives a laptop to
employing

775
00:43:36,310 --> 00:43:39,710
employees does XYZ legal whatever

776
00:43:39,710 --> 00:43:42,910
does the company have to answer for
their employees in a way because the

777
00:43:42,910 --> 00:43:45,230
company requiring crib shiner

778
00:43:45,230 --> 00:43:50,099
put these policies in place okay so im
like any employer be held liable for our

779
00:43:50,099 --> 00:43:51,349
employees is doing

780
00:43:51,349 --> 00:43:55,529
that's a good question I'm and I don't
have a great answer at the top of my

781
00:43:55,529 --> 00:43:59,440
head for that I would've I would suspect
the employer is going to try their best

782
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:00,980
to say

783
00:44:00,980 --> 00:44:04,119
luck yeah in the in the employment
context there's a distinction between

784
00:44:04,119 --> 00:44:05,660
things you do

785
00:44:05,660 --> 00:44:08,859
at the behest and your company endings
youjizz do on your own time

786
00:44:08,859 --> 00:44:11,569
even if you're using the company's
equipment and so it's gonna really

787
00:44:11,569 --> 00:44:14,230
depend on that now let's say you're
doing the legal stuff on the B has to

788
00:44:14,230 --> 00:44:15,660
your company then that's going to be

789
00:44:15,660 --> 00:44:18,290
you know then yeah obviously the
company's gonna lie what you're doing

790
00:44:18,290 --> 00:44:19,469
just up on your own

791
00:44:19,469 --> 00:44:23,330
they are using your employers equipment
then a you know there's gonna be

792
00:44:23,330 --> 00:44:26,940
a much more folk much more the book is
going to be on you rather than on the

793
00:44:26,940 --> 00:44:30,049
company them except make sense

794
00:44:30,049 --> 00:44:34,410
thank yeah

795
00:44:34,410 --> 00:44:38,120
a any thanks for talking to them I guess
it seems

796
00:44:38,120 --> 00:44:41,250
like from what you're saying that
creating a document and document

797
00:44:41,250 --> 00:44:42,970
retention policies a pretty good idea

798
00:44:42,970 --> 00:44:47,660
a I guess what I'm wondering is what
service in areas are there

799
00:44:47,660 --> 00:44:52,009
that could be considered anticipatory
obstruction of justice

800
00:44:52,010 --> 00:44:55,010
for creating a docking retention

801
00:44:55,010 --> 00:44:57,870
yeah

802
00:44:57,870 --> 00:45:01,020
the willamette good to talk about

803
00:45:01,020 --> 00:45:04,060
that's why I understand like an obvious
wanna be like

804
00:45:04,060 --> 00:45:07,940
you created after a yeah investigations
bidding

805
00:45:07,940 --> 00:45:11,980
to cover your ass let's say you haven't
done anything wrong and he came to

806
00:45:11,980 --> 00:45:16,030
hoping you heard this awesome Thomas
hostage-taker and his ID to go back in

807
00:45:16,030 --> 00:45:19,360
you know I think it's gonna be good idea
gained national attention bosnian

808
00:45:19,360 --> 00:45:22,880
I think you're probably okay um again
it's gonna be

809
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:26,180
is not legal advice from you this is not
legal advice I

810
00:45:26,180 --> 00:45:29,520
said yeah I think you're probably gonna
be okay you know its

811
00:45:29,520 --> 00:45:33,890
it's a very factual determination and so
a lot of it is gonna just append

812
00:45:33,890 --> 00:45:38,370
on you know I think Euro came being a
little bit paranoid

813
00:45:38,370 --> 00:45:42,540
is OK like being a little bit paranoid
does it make you a criminal necessarily

814
00:45:42,540 --> 00:45:46,390
am you know been a little bit paranoid
and also doing something that's been

815
00:45:46,390 --> 00:45:47,180
maybe

816
00:45:47,180 --> 00:45:50,450
questionable is gonna be a bigger
problem

817
00:45:50,450 --> 00:45:54,790
so it's hard for me to answer your
question all I would say is

818
00:45:54,790 --> 00:45:58,080
if you don't have one yet I would
encourage you to do I'm

819
00:45:58,080 --> 00:46:01,210
before am a that something bad happens

820
00:46:01,210 --> 00:46:04,540
or you think something bad has happened
because that's an odd if you think it's

821
00:46:04,540 --> 00:46:04,900
bad

822
00:46:04,900 --> 00:46:08,470
um and that's how did the best I may be
able to

823
00:46:08,470 --> 00:46:12,080
the tell you right now cyanide not not
the best answer but that's the best I

824
00:46:12,080 --> 00:46:13,529
could come up with check

825
00:46:13,530 --> 00:46:19,490
thank you your I'm stepping back from an
absolute unjustified paranoia for a

826
00:46:19,490 --> 00:46:20,270
moment

827
00:46:20,270 --> 00:46:23,600
and probably a lot of people so the
guideline for the Seventh Circuit

828
00:46:23,600 --> 00:46:28,720
that stated that disk blocks which were
part 2 deleted files or not normally

829
00:46:28,720 --> 00:46:30,470
accessible for the operating system

830
00:46:30,470 --> 00:46:33,740
are not discoverable can you comment

831
00:46:33,740 --> 00:46:38,610
on whether this guidelines exist in any
other circuits

832
00:46:38,610 --> 00:46:41,830
under what circumstances is likely to be
honored

833
00:46:41,830 --> 00:46:46,009
and how something can enter into
evidence if that thing is not

834
00:46:46,010 --> 00:46:47,120
discoverable

835
00:46:47,120 --> 00:46:51,620
well I think in terms of other circuits

836
00:46:51,620 --> 00:46:55,109
I don't know the answer to that of up
top my head but I can look back

837
00:46:55,110 --> 00:46:59,080
in terms of how things can be dis
discoverable

838
00:46:59,080 --> 00:47:02,740
dad at how something can be admitted
into evidence that's not discoverable I

839
00:47:02,740 --> 00:47:04,940
think it's important to distinguish

840
00:47:04,940 --> 00:47:08,810
between at the criminal process and the
civil process

841
00:47:08,810 --> 00:47:12,020
end in the civil litigation

842
00:47:12,020 --> 00:47:15,840
process the way the and in again that
the speaker before me when intel on a

843
00:47:15,840 --> 00:47:16,580
detail that is

844
00:47:16,580 --> 00:47:20,690
there's all the document creation

845
00:47:20,690 --> 00:47:24,220
right now creation but the way documents
are gathered input at issue

846
00:47:24,220 --> 00:47:28,150
any civil lawsuit or civil case are done
by the parties so

847
00:47:28,150 --> 00:47:31,650
subpoenas are sent an interrogatory
their sentences discovery

848
00:47:31,650 --> 00:47:34,860
but in a criminal case the discovery is
one-sided

849
00:47:34,860 --> 00:47:39,240
and what happens is the government gets
the information

850
00:47:39,240 --> 00:47:42,900
and most often they're not getting
admitted the assistance and the

851
00:47:42,900 --> 00:47:43,770
defendant now

852
00:47:43,770 --> 00:47:48,000
at me talk about the fifth amendment
context and encryption and that maybe

853
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:51,660
a very rare exception to that when
they've had an absolute roadblock

854
00:47:51,660 --> 00:47:55,410
but for the most part but they're doing
is they're getting search warrants and

855
00:47:55,410 --> 00:47:57,730
subpoenas in going to ISP is an

856
00:47:57,730 --> 00:48:01,770
service providers n you know getting the
information from

857
00:48:01,770 --> 00:48:04,930
other individuals are maybe they have a
a

858
00:48:04,930 --> 00:48:08,580
a witness who loved the hand over all
the emails that say for example

859
00:48:08,580 --> 00:48:12,049
and then what that means is that all the
discovery

860
00:48:12,050 --> 00:48:15,060
malls that apply in the civil case

861
00:48:15,060 --> 00:48:19,120
don't necessarily control in a criminal
case

862
00:48:19,120 --> 00:48:21,750
so even though something may not be
discoverable for several purposes

863
00:48:21,750 --> 00:48:23,470
doesn't necessarily mean

864
00:48:23,470 --> 00:48:27,420
it's not admissible any criminal case
now that subject to you

865
00:48:27,420 --> 00:48:31,010
it at the evidence was obtained in
violation I like the fourth amendment

866
00:48:31,010 --> 00:48:33,430
for example let's say that police went
to

867
00:48:33,430 --> 00:48:37,870
Google and said give us all the emails
you have for this user and we're not

868
00:48:37,870 --> 00:48:40,250
doing research we're just gonna do with
the subpoena

869
00:48:40,250 --> 00:48:43,250
and we want the emails enter knew where
the

870
00:48:43,250 --> 00:48:47,450
100 up not 180 days all you know the
ones from last week's well that's that's

871
00:48:47,450 --> 00:48:51,350
illegally obtained evidence and you know
it's suppressed or you know getting it

872
00:48:51,350 --> 00:48:54,569
in a physical contact like if the cops
just walk into your house and took your

873
00:48:54,570 --> 00:48:56,960
stuff without a search warrant that
would be an illegal search

874
00:48:56,960 --> 00:49:00,620
and you could maybe get struck out that
way but the civil discovery was not

875
00:49:00,620 --> 00:49:02,279
gonna necessarily help you in a good
mood

876
00:49:02,280 --> 00:49:06,660
so the the one-sentence summary would be
that if a criminal allegation is made

877
00:49:06,660 --> 00:49:10,259
then the protection on Discovery do not
apply way back paranoia

878
00:49:10,260 --> 00:49:14,000
Anna yes when do that sir

879
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:21,000
would be considered obstruction of
justice applied to your running Windows

880
00:49:21,720 --> 00:49:23,580
and Windows side crackdown

881
00:49:23,580 --> 00:49:26,830
macon getting it down from again it has
to be willful

882
00:49:26,830 --> 00:49:31,690
so you have to be the one not to be
knowingly willingly doing something if

883
00:49:31,690 --> 00:49:32,490
they just like

884
00:49:32,490 --> 00:49:36,740
I got a virus in my damn hard ride and I
didn't mean to get a virus

885
00:49:36,740 --> 00:49:40,250
then okay now camiones it he said

886
00:49:40,250 --> 00:49:44,000
I you know the feds are coming from I
think I accidentally download a virus

887
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:47,260
band you know that's gonna be a problem
so it's all about what you willingly

888
00:49:47,260 --> 00:49:48,600
knowingly do

889
00:49:48,600 --> 00:49:52,810
thank you Jeff thing is prolly gonna
last one yeah go ahead

890
00:49:52,810 --> 00:49:57,350
made I hope this is school here and so
encryption is protected by a

891
00:49:57,350 --> 00:50:01,120
the right to not something permanent it
can be yes the Kenny

892
00:50:01,120 --> 00:50:04,410
but not by right to privacy you talk
about by the

893
00:50:04,410 --> 00:50:07,859
like under the Fourth Amendment's that's
a different issue

894
00:50:07,860 --> 00:50:12,410
I am and and in all the encryption cases
that happen

895
00:50:12,410 --> 00:50:17,040
kinda become our they've all dealt with
the computer searches done by search

896
00:50:17,040 --> 00:50:17,820
warrant

897
00:50:17,820 --> 00:50:22,230
generally speaking search one is enough
to overcome the fourth amendment

898
00:50:22,230 --> 00:50:25,350
it ran away saying the board members
search warrant so

899
00:50:25,350 --> 00:50:29,220
but say they under the fourth amendment
they have a legal right to be in the

900
00:50:29,220 --> 00:50:30,330
computer so

901
00:50:30,330 --> 00:50:33,610
in the encryption cases where the search
warrant exists no

902
00:50:33,610 --> 00:50:37,160
you're not pretty necessarily protected
by the peso

903
00:50:37,160 --> 00:50:41,509
could end rather well conclusion that
I'm better protected

904
00:50:41,510 --> 00:50:45,930
if if well to my hard drive is could
already person like not myself

905
00:50:45,930 --> 00:50:49,879
I'm I am thats person is better prepared
medical personnel present

906
00:50:49,880 --> 00:50:52,920
this person is better protected up

907
00:50:52,920 --> 00:50:57,100
forward if they just wanna have you know
privacy by actually can

908
00:50:57,100 --> 00:51:01,340
having evidence up some crime on the
right time and then they can say

909
00:51:01,340 --> 00:51:05,320
well I'm I'm protected by the fifth
amendment so

910
00:51:05,320 --> 00:51:11,600
I don't need to review hi I wouldn't I
would agree with that doesn't has

911
00:51:11,600 --> 00:51:12,310
begotten

912
00:51:12,310 --> 00:51:15,820
actually you know by late Bob the lost
my

913
00:51:15,820 --> 00:51:19,040
I would let me say that i think is a
good way to conclude

914
00:51:19,040 --> 00:51:22,910
the more steps to take to protect your
privacy the better

915
00:51:22,910 --> 00:51:27,710
even if that means that the cord doesn't
necessarily see it the same way

916
00:51:27,710 --> 00:51:31,050
so what I would say is I wouldn't rip if
I were you arm

917
00:51:31,050 --> 00:51:34,530
because you're gonna be potentially
protected under the Fifth Amendment

918
00:51:34,530 --> 00:51:37,470
and you know the Fourth Amendment
protection kicks in by the fact that the

919
00:51:37,470 --> 00:51:39,520
government needs to get a search warrant
to get your stuff

920
00:51:39,520 --> 00:51:43,280
a you know there again exceptions you
can agreed to let the matter stuff we

921
00:51:43,280 --> 00:51:43,840
should

922
00:51:43,840 --> 00:51:47,270
please nobody and consent to anything
okay um

923
00:51:47,270 --> 00:51:50,960
again on legal advice and blamed

924
00:51:50,960 --> 00:51:54,520
you know I I would say more more
protection is better

925
00:51:54,520 --> 00:52:00,080
yes the law is slow to keep %uh with the
changes in technology and kinda deal

926
00:52:00,080 --> 00:52:00,770
with these

927
00:52:00,770 --> 00:52:03,920
quirky situations are only now starting
to get ourselves into but

928
00:52:03,920 --> 00:52:07,520
I would say you're better off imprinting
it so I shouldn't

929
00:52:07,520 --> 00:52:10,540
a person %um a hypothetical person
shouldn't

930
00:52:10,540 --> 00:52:14,750
backs in aid him or herself by like
running stop by having picture taken on

931
00:52:14,750 --> 00:52:15,290
it

932
00:52:15,290 --> 00:52:19,500
and storing it on a hard yet without an
amazing I'd rather be a bad idea

933
00:52:19,500 --> 00:52:26,340
ok okay thank you guys very much
appreciated well
