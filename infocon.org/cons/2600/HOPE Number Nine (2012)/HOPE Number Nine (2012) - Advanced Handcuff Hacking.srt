1
00:00:00,089 --> 00:00:07,089
of very cool our

2
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:12,300
so let tomorrow president of the
Security Hopland

3
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:17,240
over the open to greet him I was over
there are not by my probation officer

4
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:21,460
to get this talk about had come back and
be one its kind of back rubs

5
00:00:21,460 --> 00:00:26,760
whistle-blowing site gives the criminals
goes to you legal problem

6
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:30,539
I'm not talking less about him correctly
sour

7
00:00:30,539 --> 00:00:34,079
advanced am having that basically what
the criminals bring you should know

8
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:35,399
about it so you can

9
00:00:35,399 --> 00:00:40,680
at probably in the daily duty I didn't
write a review of the talk

10
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:44,200
that there would be ok

11
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:47,140
was not shot sharp are done on the basis
for him not

12
00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:51,750
because I know I love you and your busy
day don't have time to check everything

13
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:54,940
so but we don't know your where the
Humber

14
00:00:54,940 --> 00:00:59,059
senator but conceded keys that susan is
you people are constantly was

15
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:02,220
all over the place and you should know
how that is done

16
00:01:02,220 --> 00:01:05,610
in the restaurant even if they don't
have to read them eg the keys from

17
00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:07,590
whatever they find it really dangerous

18
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:11,119
then I wanted to do was a few new
comments are around

19
00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:15,160
as well in europe our stores in the US
so new

20
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:19,660
know the new stock you can you can buy
to the two prisoners cock

21
00:01:19,660 --> 00:01:22,729
and under the nurse deal in the criminal
industry im

22
00:01:22,729 --> 00:01:25,780
daylle intentional computers management
for big sister

23
00:01:25,780 --> 00:01:30,240
time he was working and have keys so
that's a pain in the ass but we can't do

24
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:31,059
anything about it

25
00:01:31,060 --> 00:01:36,330
okay the basics doesn't have power

26
00:01:36,330 --> 00:01:40,490
it has a very simple mechanism to have
the ball here you can see the

27
00:01:40,490 --> 00:01:44,310
the most under because I can lead a
point here

28
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:48,700
and there's a two-part mechanism does
having the screenwriter paul switch

29
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:52,920
their direction to get there was a bomb
and down nearly as a buyer

30
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:57,030
it should be fresh from the side and his
press the park on moved on the most

31
00:01:57,030 --> 00:01:59,190
accomplished completely locked in
Concord

32
00:01:59,190 --> 00:02:02,850
open or closed buck

33
00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:07,330
one thing about encompassing most urban
owners that every brand has a slightly

34
00:02:07,330 --> 00:02:08,190
different key

35
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:11,550
but more or less the major one hour the
same

36
00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:16,250
except for a few parted millimeter if
you check I was able to keep my

37
00:02:16,250 --> 00:02:20,380
out it's a key from ESPN from Smith's
investment actually opens most of the

38
00:02:20,380 --> 00:02:23,250
brands available in the market today so
if you want to be prepared

39
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:27,130
just had one of those and whatever you
call it covers issues there

40
00:02:27,130 --> 00:02:31,329
it would open the cops especially if you
money by your

41
00:02:31,330 --> 00:02:36,599
business investment limited by finding
down the smart part here

42
00:02:36,599 --> 00:02:40,109
and getting this is not beginning an
openly gay and lesbian

43
00:02:40,110 --> 00:02:44,380
you would have security cock Huskies
owns Starwood

44
00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:49,480
to to your home so if you don't want to
go so are the hassle of water in it that

45
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:50,040
way

46
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:53,690
you can simply one file is key you know
the amendment

47
00:02:53,690 --> 00:02:57,340
making and ok

48
00:02:57,340 --> 00:03:00,470
made by me but i wouldnt presented a
decade before

49
00:03:00,470 --> 00:03:04,030
percent for the picture what has been
the perfect ok

50
00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:08,160
made amends to Rome to open basically
everything on the market is basically

51
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:10,099
what you get when you modify this was
messin he

52
00:03:10,099 --> 00:03:14,660
but that is a good thing to know is if
they put the slides unless I'm going to

53
00:03:14,660 --> 00:03:14,980
the

54
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:18,730
there hope to help in securing the
Internet so you can download it later

55
00:03:18,730 --> 00:03:22,610
but you can of course for delivered
right now our

56
00:03:22,610 --> 00:03:25,700
okay if you don't have a key in a
standards-based

57
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:30,010
opening Handcock are sharing and by
pressing problem

58
00:03:30,010 --> 00:03:34,069
shouldn't have to know if you can see it
here is going to put a small piece of

59
00:03:34,069 --> 00:03:34,640
metal

60
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:38,170
our between the ball went to power so it
goes

61
00:03:38,170 --> 00:03:42,110
im to Tennessee the cities of the BOM

62
00:03:42,110 --> 00:03:45,440
and separated to possibly can just show
it here defines the

63
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:52,440
of

64
00:03:55,049 --> 00:03:58,629
ok given up nine I think sewer

65
00:03:58,629 --> 00:04:03,909
so by going in here together with the
bro a separate supported those open

66
00:04:03,909 --> 00:04:08,219
so that's really simple the other is
coming from the other side is it a

67
00:04:08,219 --> 00:04:10,150
condom right now our

68
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:13,560
so coming from this side of the cup is
not closed very much and the nice thing

69
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:14,639
about this this goes

70
00:04:14,639 --> 00:04:17,940
the record basically everything of
societal

71
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:21,668
of the this year not doesn't give a
reason

72
00:04:21,668 --> 00:04:26,198
you can press down the poorer simply
from the side and an openly

73
00:04:26,199 --> 00:04:30,039
opens in both our across both these
messages

74
00:04:30,039 --> 00:04:33,310
they would recommend the cops are double
lock

75
00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:36,720
manza Cingular offers already order to
YouTube are based do

76
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:42,039
because the danger of injury to a
prisoner court that's a custom

77
00:04:42,039 --> 00:04:45,719
too tight and then afterward go to court
and say I don't have to close everything

78
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:46,259
though

79
00:04:46,259 --> 00:04:50,160
our best to block your cock so he
doesn't use a condom because the

80
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:52,500
productive to get rid of the block

81
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:57,820
and a gun me to do that using the key
its gonna turn the key in the opposite

82
00:04:57,820 --> 00:04:59,740
direction is for openings over to Kenyan

83
00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:04,080
his acumen I don't think you can see
very good but really key goes down here

84
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:08,508
and the press is a problem the governor
Kitzhaber recordings otherwise is a key

85
00:05:08,509 --> 00:05:09,909
goes around here

86
00:05:09,909 --> 00:05:13,280
and move the blocking borrower just over
to the right

87
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:18,750
bike cider club are you have to remember
to pick it was some other two were

88
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:23,590
the first time a move that part over
there you can use any babes Americans

89
00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:24,720
movement of the key

90
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:28,490
but depending mostly accept cash
consideration you also can

91
00:05:28,490 --> 00:05:32,400
tendered is the other day gets from here
to just some approaches

92
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:36,360
seeing a two button to the right and
then we can either show 'em

93
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:39,710
bar but every message to use to get the
ball down

94
00:05:39,710 --> 00:05:43,539
when I sing about the government the
just someone lost

95
00:05:43,539 --> 00:05:46,900
which have a very heavy bar here I think
this board

96
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:50,789
could be one awesome for the massive
this is Jai ne

97
00:05:50,789 --> 00:05:55,460
the small embed bigoted our I think we
can show this year

98
00:05:55,460 --> 00:06:02,460
of

99
00:06:02,870 --> 00:06:07,110
destroying the whole conference after
the Islamic us to block

100
00:06:07,110 --> 00:06:10,169
using a blog but pushing in this but in
the Sikkim

101
00:06:10,169 --> 00:06:13,710
so it doesn't move anymore and i couldnt
the

102
00:06:13,710 --> 00:06:17,029
should know by president right now ok
sober takes lead and

103
00:06:17,029 --> 00:06:21,139
hammered in this direction so like the
bloke went up this way to have to go

104
00:06:21,139 --> 00:06:21,599
this

105
00:06:21,599 --> 00:06:25,229
on some object the block is out again

106
00:06:25,229 --> 00:06:32,229
do where

107
00:06:33,159 --> 00:06:36,479
ever had to depend on the strength of
this spring

108
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:40,240
and Samantha CNN king bar I don't know
if this summer

109
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:47,240
Tom for him to go to hell because he has
a critique of

110
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:51,680
which I don't help unite now but you can
watch the video from four years ago

111
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:54,940
separate a better health insurer under
topper

112
00:06:54,940 --> 00:06:58,960
but unknown to most good bread blocking
the number looks so you could simply 100

113
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,479
out and should pick up like normal

114
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:04,449
you knowing that has a gridlock

115
00:07:04,449 --> 00:07:08,169
okay 30 don't want to do next yet to
concede peace

116
00:07:08,169 --> 00:07:11,279
buck

117
00:07:11,279 --> 00:07:15,349
their different kind compressed air bed
and was just another key

118
00:07:15,349 --> 00:07:20,050
missus his number this for example is
the bed key personnel from you do to bed

119
00:07:20,050 --> 00:07:21,219
to keep your gear part

120
00:07:21,219 --> 00:07:25,430
it looks just like a normal bed keep
going to bed but in the inside

121
00:07:25,430 --> 00:07:29,139
just a standard keyboard just or so
basically the universal

122
00:07:29,139 --> 00:07:32,639
proportions so we've been trying out a
new look

123
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:36,139
but you did was not identified it if
you're looking at about our

124
00:07:36,139 --> 00:07:39,229
so some criminal neither and customers
on handcuffs

125
00:07:39,229 --> 00:07:42,710
you probably won't find of

126
00:07:42,710 --> 00:07:46,320
there's another one but tactical and
became looks like a very high quality

127
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:48,919
item

128
00:07:48,919 --> 00:07:53,210
it is best to come home that compress
the park's run or so close to bed the

129
00:07:53,210 --> 00:07:54,180
other one is

130
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:57,849
it can be used as an the pair helped to
lead to

131
00:07:57,849 --> 00:08:01,490
too liberal agenda for every hour

132
00:08:01,490 --> 00:08:04,940
and buy new open a copper dozen

133
00:08:04,940 --> 00:08:09,690
monarchy in sight just becomes a key but
you can basically put any key

134
00:08:09,690 --> 00:08:13,839
you have in insider ok

135
00:08:13,839 --> 00:08:17,440
sewer and you're not had formal computer
case

136
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:21,050
this press the keys best pick you up old
boss ever

137
00:08:21,050 --> 00:08:25,940
wanna bendiga con be found by metal
detectors 792

138
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:29,120
go to jail to visit was no anything you
know it was me but everything you have

139
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:30,300
to give up equipment

140
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:35,500
million domestic he has no problem so
can have the book goes smoothly through

141
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:36,299
the method and

142
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:40,050
member to bother you so just keep
working as with you berenger

143
00:08:40,049 --> 00:08:43,390
very convenient this one year's actually
I think

144
00:08:43,390 --> 00:08:46,630
also sold down there in the second
column

145
00:08:46,630 --> 00:08:50,779
I'm it has two little boys and their
which enables them to be stolen

146
00:08:50,779 --> 00:08:54,540
into a close so I'll you can use it
instead of a button up but it doesn't

147
00:08:54,540 --> 00:08:55,890
look really let the bottom

148
00:08:55,890 --> 00:09:00,260
gun the story from the other side to
about it because if someone is

149
00:09:00,260 --> 00:09:04,890
bed in a dollar burger with the bottom a
dream as opposed to other sides list or

150
00:09:04,890 --> 00:09:05,949
something like that

151
00:09:05,950 --> 00:09:08,959
so you should know that when taking
somebody im

152
00:09:08,959 --> 00:09:12,519
I'm sure the sooner the popular pop in
to cure it does it does it all the time

153
00:09:12,519 --> 00:09:18,060
at the best but but oh so very hot here
so be sure to check coming back on

154
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:21,250
for hidden keys of course it's
unrealistic but

155
00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:26,019
I have to tell you there the new orders
index ticker:

156
00:09:26,019 --> 00:09:30,190
okay there was nothing was another even
more smaller the better

157
00:09:30,190 --> 00:09:34,170
you're just also headed the attacker to
whatever it looks like he had reportedly

158
00:09:34,170 --> 00:09:35,060
been

159
00:09:35,060 --> 00:09:39,720
but if you move up this way but the park
the smoke and the key to lock

160
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:43,970
there's also is basically was a keen and
drugs almost $10 cover but it's not as

161
00:09:43,970 --> 00:09:47,880
stronger symmetric you think are good
too often but didn't work

162
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:53,290
emergency situations these I got from
the bay so if you search on eBay for

163
00:09:53,290 --> 00:09:55,649
continued handcuff keys are plastic
handcuffs

164
00:09:55,649 --> 00:09:59,820
is a stub Mike variations of these for
example arsenide

165
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:05,329
that run that section was survival
bracelets consisting of a very strong

166
00:10:05,329 --> 00:10:09,570
and borrow from got my ever dome

167
00:10:09,570 --> 00:10:13,870
got so according to the August moon
journeyed across or something getting up

168
00:10:13,870 --> 00:10:15,410
and deliver something

169
00:10:15,410 --> 00:10:18,519
Anna

170
00:10:18,519 --> 00:10:21,829
here in the public and to see if you can
see the barber and then you open the

171
00:10:21,829 --> 00:10:22,930
barber

172
00:10:22,930 --> 00:10:26,540
then again the

173
00:10:26,540 --> 00:10:30,639
this morn as the key inside the nice
thing is you can also buy this battle is

174
00:10:30,639 --> 00:10:32,420
a key as a separate item

175
00:10:32,420 --> 00:10:36,050
and for example headed to Iraq said or
whatever there's a bottom

176
00:10:36,050 --> 00:10:39,639
about the size that the backlit globally
recognized

177
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:42,889
by anybody searching for when companies
were unusual items and of course the

178
00:10:42,889 --> 00:10:44,300
best big

179
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:48,170
so it's not found by at the metal
detectors

180
00:10:48,170 --> 00:10:51,920
ok ok let's assume all the consummate

181
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:58,019
member but at home done it is absurd you
have to compromise

182
00:10:58,019 --> 00:11:02,670
so know he'll pick than ever the bed by
this look around you

183
00:11:02,670 --> 00:11:07,170
just bottom is something which is of
metal is banned amor

184
00:11:07,170 --> 00:11:11,870
whatever and took are serbs being
prepared for movies

185
00:11:11,870 --> 00:11:17,740
cynicism or shorten the bank for your
entertainment

186
00:11:17,740 --> 00:11:21,430
there's a scene from the movie was my
first 100 Small Medium

187
00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:26,500
out she was unknown if you know any
however that the Melbourne

188
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:31,730
but that's good but no the text because
I only have two German murderer

189
00:11:31,730 --> 00:11:35,160
that is made so that probably had reason
to not said problematic

190
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:38,399
if you want as from the should be a lady
or ok so he's not there

191
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:42,170
to bed sewer here's the movie

192
00:11:42,170 --> 00:11:46,229

that someone hiding is in front of the
chest going on the end on when this

198

lebanon guys like Superman

199
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:11,250
since he felt like is the government
that I must admit I know I don't get it

200
00:12:11,250 --> 00:12:15,220
mantra is excellent as the foundation in
your pocket grab-bag

201
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:18,480
plentiful not only designed for the
Gonzalez lip

202
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:22,350
deputy names as the party's on shown up

203
00:12:22,350 --> 00:12:28,350
loopy manages to Santa do it yourself

204
00:12:28,350 --> 00:12:32,320
time now look around what do we have
here

205
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:39,320
take a vote by 74 letter from what is he
doing

206
00:12:45,850 --> 00:12:47,899
the

207
00:12:47,899 --> 00:12:52,579
very close was it since I jane McManus I
that michelle hasn't come yet

208
00:12:52,579 --> 00:12:56,610
50 happy at the gala minors under the
covers in my heart my soul to jesse

209
00:12:56,610 --> 00:12:57,220
jackson vs

210
00:12:57,220 --> 00:13:04,220
my I never seen that before Asian Age
minded

211
00:13:04,930 --> 00:13:07,950
tributes okay so

212
00:13:07,950 --> 00:13:12,630
look around you find something that my
burger but of course it's a movie

213
00:13:12,630 --> 00:13:17,930
so is a movie really realistic body
isn't who think the Berks

214
00:13:17,930 --> 00:13:20,940
one people who think that was fake

215
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:24,780
who think that was big but it actually
works

216
00:13:24,780 --> 00:13:28,430
that summer

217
00:13:28,430 --> 00:13:32,930
the German TV show which did something
might be amiss but this dire

218
00:13:32,930 --> 00:13:36,080
and members of the team a baby with that
seen because there's another seems a bit

219
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:37,040
longer

220
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:41,250
broke a mirror as investors knighted but
basically the same thing earlier movie

221
00:13:41,250 --> 00:13:46,250
and the German TV show wanted to find
out is really possible or is it did

222
00:13:46,250 --> 00:13:51,260
just a movie miss summer you do you
probably didn't %uh block you just put

223
00:13:51,260 --> 00:13:52,060
them under and

224
00:13:52,060 --> 00:13:55,880
service Ponyboy so you have to set your
priorities I did a blockbuster on the

225
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:58,439
phone amid

226
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:02,910
he decided to show the economy but to be
a bad idea okay so this German TV series

227
00:14:02,910 --> 00:14:03,410
show

228
00:14:03,410 --> 00:14:07,140
but indeed very clever because it's our
own it ask an expert

229
00:14:07,140 --> 00:14:14,140
so to speak see the sea see the expert
the bill in the men's

230
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:20,690
butter and ultimately into villages in
the

231
00:14:20,690 --> 00:14:24,980
sleep with the enemy community i'm for
im Schloss that shit is a line

232
00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:29,600
you can bend she is picking up items and
then cut a larger cup so that they don't

233
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:31,080
know how that feels like home

234
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:35,200
Clapton BB device raisons membership
room

235
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:41,790
a rush on the line Graham Nash chairman

236
00:14:41,790 --> 00:14:43,760

237
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:47,980
2708 at a huge investments can't

238
00:14:47,980 --> 00:14:52,250
heading to change its and isozyme
different

239
00:14:52,250 --> 00:14:55,910
tough time boo knows who sewer

240
00:14:55,910 --> 00:15:02,819
it actually works well I want to

241
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:08,440
at a you are under arrest for their
presentation of a a movie that this

242
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:09,300
Government

243
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:13,350
under that that's a movie about John
copyright and work preventing it in a

244
00:15:13,350 --> 00:15:16,580
the country that's not licensed from you
are under arrest

245
00:15:16,580 --> 00:15:21,009
I i Park tonight on YouTube up I don't
you

246
00:15:21,009 --> 00:15:23,949
give me a hint braved

247
00:15:23,949 --> 00:15:26,949
whatcha doing it not but of you up

248
00:15:26,949 --> 00:15:31,160
them

249
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:35,929
our top what come get me I i think that
and

250
00:15:35,929 --> 00:15:39,160
misunderstanding I think there's
something like the

251
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:42,769
fair use the visitation mister officer

252
00:15:42,769 --> 00:15:49,559
not can I borrow a hug our

253
00:15:49,559 --> 00:15:53,988
up

254
00:15:53,989 --> 00:16:00,459
way

255
00:16:00,459 --> 00:16:03,609
okay go back to germany and get your
cupboard lost learnt

256
00:16:03,609 --> 00:16:07,229
ok

257
00:16:07,229 --> 00:16:11,789
okay further action was no baby that
really works

258
00:16:11,789 --> 00:16:16,949
there is no that's not really im burden
inside the keynote because it was like

259
00:16:16,949 --> 00:16:21,179
but that was a handcuff lichen American
model the hire comes in is a very

260
00:16:21,179 --> 00:16:21,939
popular

261
00:16:21,939 --> 00:16:27,399
which has the key holder to the upside
so I don't agree to go around a move it

262
00:16:27,399 --> 00:16:29,459
I just had to bend to the side really

263
00:16:29,459 --> 00:16:32,969
with the parts are and that it had them
down so that's

264
00:16:32,969 --> 00:16:38,059
the nice thing and it's ok that the
tour's don't always have to be the same

265
00:16:38,059 --> 00:16:41,718
thing to fit and that's a keynote is
just a stupid but at a slower

266
00:16:41,719 --> 00:16:45,759
of course only if it is not a block but
we don't know and a movie at boston won

267
00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:46,659
in the one seen

268
00:16:46,659 --> 00:16:51,699
and no base to get double ugh rate of
course the movie the scene was fake

269
00:16:51,699 --> 00:16:55,279
anyway because you can see he threw them
down but was cut open the same time

270
00:16:55,279 --> 00:16:59,539
that would really be very tricky to do
ok

271
00:16:59,539 --> 00:17:02,720
so this through people who said it was
fake but really rocks were right

272
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:06,159
congratulations in okay

273
00:17:06,159 --> 00:17:09,519
but reliever XL foods by sight broke

274
00:17:09,519 --> 00:17:12,669
so AM talking about new cars they're not

275
00:17:12,669 --> 00:17:16,879
are to improve security there's some
just three models are interesting models

276
00:17:16,879 --> 00:17:19,419
this is a strange thing is really very
very new

277
00:17:19,419 --> 00:17:23,500
is invented by a fellow officer but i
think is not from the hope in security

278
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:24,628
but for months on

279
00:17:24,629 --> 00:17:27,980
other official agency below when I guess
its

280
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:32,470
griped high-quality Scott the from they
must be completely those expensive

281
00:17:32,470 --> 00:17:33,070
process

282
00:17:33,070 --> 00:17:36,389
is r6 inexpensive cops I'm not really
sure if people

283
00:17:36,389 --> 00:17:40,399
people to buy it but it is a funny
picture much if you can understand that

284
00:17:40,399 --> 00:17:41,990
but one side here

285
00:17:41,990 --> 00:17:45,879
can be rotated in one direction but not
back so

286
00:17:45,879 --> 00:17:52,879
of

287
00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:57,350
number ready of

288
00:17:57,350 --> 00:18:01,040
should leave the key that i think is a
glasses again

289
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:05,270
sewer if you have you had been here I
won't do that now because I just went

290
00:18:05,270 --> 00:18:08,600
investing too what with the dude and you
have two hundred

291
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:12,860
if it turns out like this way and then
you're like this and then you can grab

292
00:18:12,860 --> 00:18:14,060
his gun or anything

293
00:18:14,060 --> 00:18:18,149
but idk on turn back so dramatic very
convenient

294
00:18:18,150 --> 00:18:21,800
the problem with that is I think that
they did injury

295
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:26,490
law cases and everything because
depended more stuff like that

296
00:18:26,490 --> 00:18:30,680
the dangerous and the other thing is
they're very proud that the increase the

297
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:31,820
size here

298
00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:35,480
third picture most thais services and
everything but

299
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:39,510
if you're not this but even a diverse
this title hand

300
00:18:39,510 --> 00:18:44,220
you can turn your hands insider and if
you can't do that you can simply go

301
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:47,460
around turn your head and get back to
the standard position

302
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:51,180
so in case you arrested. using this to
the cops

303
00:18:51,180 --> 00:18:54,760
or a few nice cup but not

304
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:59,129
not really press start to the end as I'm
just make sure that is they are not

305
00:18:59,130 --> 00:19:02,150
apply to tide level are upset I did
everything

306
00:19:02,150 --> 00:19:05,540
then possibly but Berggren buttocks

307
00:19:05,540 --> 00:19:08,899
a nice mechanism animated an image
median you want to market

308
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:12,400
we'll see what happens I guess it would
be a collector's items I keep my

309
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:15,780
here so something different

310
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:19,340
but you not the new cover on the block
but a new thing to show we both

311
00:19:19,340 --> 00:19:23,159
and averaged but was able to show it
actually happens this

312
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:26,980
if anything because the complete to less
the tagger

313
00:19:26,980 --> 00:19:31,920
Sosan in handcuffs on the German market
for

314
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:36,130
quite some time I would say and

315
00:19:36,130 --> 00:19:39,380
it was used by basically our German
police officers from nineteen

316
00:19:39,380 --> 00:19:42,620
72 in no 6 2010 thing

317
00:19:42,620 --> 00:19:46,400
and then there's another very nice
feature that you can activate the RR

318
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:49,800
not is a key but just depressing in a
side is a good for the vid you

319
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:56,800
in

320
00:19:59,799 --> 00:20:06,799
so organized to put it all together not
done in

321
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:08,399
talk

322
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:12,620
I was looking for the book so there's a
cock

323
00:20:12,620 --> 00:20:15,650
and you can activate a double up just
depressing in here

324
00:20:15,650 --> 00:20:19,870
for now it's block that's a nice thing
the problem is

325
00:20:19,870 --> 00:20:22,930
lead with this car park you can also
rapper

326
00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:26,320
direction so the new things don't get
that I actually

327
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:31,379
opened the car inmates as best pictures
make him seem

328
00:20:31,380 --> 00:20:36,160
this is the poorer support you can get
married and moved on when you put in the

329
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:38,200
boat because everything

330
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:41,750
every time the bonus to go more 120 is
more

331
00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:45,740
it has to press down the pole positive
metrodome position

332
00:20:45,740 --> 00:20:50,510
and here's a park during the dumb luck
so if you press here

333
00:20:50,510 --> 00:20:54,900
this move there intended mode of
operation

334
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:58,680
is like this so your president and then
it's here

335
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:02,270
below the poorer blocking the border
from going down

336
00:21:02,270 --> 00:21:05,280
but if you

337
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:10,660
use it in the other way and youth brings
the ball to move down before

338
00:21:10,660 --> 00:21:15,760
now by pressing in here you can get Cllr
king prawn again

339
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:20,390
this nicely rounded shape part ok

340
00:21:20,390 --> 00:21:24,840
and I think the only reason this is
shaped around is that this is not good

341
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:28,980
looks nice here for the rain under the
key moves do not get you the key only

342
00:21:28,980 --> 00:21:30,140
goes here

343
00:21:30,140 --> 00:21:33,440
the pressure he doubted is no reason for
this to be shape round

344
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:37,600
it's just because things and you know
that he was in the CAD program but every

345
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:41,290
ok made round could actually

346
00:21:41,290 --> 00:21:44,409
even President more dour

347
00:21:44,410 --> 00:21:47,790
and this is very neither contrite to
show it's because I'm

348
00:21:47,790 --> 00:21:52,360
think you would love it if I get caught
again doesn't very but I work

349
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:56,790
so the thing you have to do is to
present in like horror stories

350
00:21:56,790 --> 00:22:01,889
three-part our up a notch United the
clock tower

351
00:22:01,890 --> 00:22:05,080
try to are not able to park could have

352
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:08,570
about as many tries under your best
guess ok

353
00:22:08,570 --> 00:22:11,620
blue your so neither

354
00:22:11,620 --> 00:22:14,870
yet should be a little bit that'd you
got to somehow

355
00:22:14,870 --> 00:22:19,350
and if you if you got that that you see
that the resistance against the company

356
00:22:19,350 --> 00:22:19,890
anymore

357
00:22:19,890 --> 00:22:24,260
the new compressible partly because only
president more down it won't get into it

358
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:31,260
that is open where

359
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:37,840
so this really is a unique attack
because without any tools I think it's

360
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:41,850
really hardly possible to get any real
use police got open except for that one

361
00:22:41,850 --> 00:22:45,020
and and i think is its the menu them
because

362
00:22:45,020 --> 00:22:48,810
exchanging passes expenditure and
actually the produce a change because

363
00:22:48,810 --> 00:22:52,179
out any markings so there's no real way
to tell the difference between the old

364
00:22:52,180 --> 00:22:53,170
and the new one

365
00:22:53,170 --> 00:22:57,590
that change that they made in the middle
trade first the interest rate here is

366
00:22:57,590 --> 00:22:58,540
harder to

367
00:22:58,540 --> 00:23:01,970
manipulated and then they finally made
it a little

368
00:23:01,970 --> 00:23:05,850
event here so it actually put it up
again the puter way to fix it but it

369
00:23:05,850 --> 00:23:08,070
took two iterations under that model
came out

370
00:23:08,070 --> 00:23:12,770
you can recognized by by looking here
insider but just to be

371
00:23:12,770 --> 00:23:16,150
trying to put down to poor the something
interesting if you feel it's going up

372
00:23:16,150 --> 00:23:17,620
then you have the new model

373
00:23:17,620 --> 00:23:20,700
butter but that's not a convenient way
to tell your business please check your

374
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:23,620
handcuffed by pressing with a
screwdriver press the underside see if

375
00:23:23,620 --> 00:23:25,040
it comes up sir

376
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:28,629
but maybe my king like new model a model
be over every would have been a good

377
00:23:28,630 --> 00:23:29,200
idea

378
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:33,310
but of course that would admit that you
had a failure in it so

379
00:23:33,310 --> 00:23:36,330
bad for them yeah

380
00:23:36,330 --> 00:23:40,610
imitrex earlier you invest in office
with your next class

381
00:23:40,610 --> 00:23:44,770
acrylic glass vision and took so you can
play around with that and

382
00:23:44,770 --> 00:23:48,490
just this announcement midler and the
last night but we'll have a look

383
00:23:48,490 --> 00:23:51,910
session to try out the cops try out for
shouldn't everything abroad

384
00:23:51,910 --> 00:23:56,140
at the 8 o'clock so after that other
lockpicking talk which is happening

385
00:23:56,140 --> 00:23:57,800
after my talk and other room

386
00:23:57,800 --> 00:24:01,780
in looking at every be at hand on hand
in whatever session if you want to try

387
00:24:01,780 --> 00:24:03,410
out have a look at a stock

388
00:24:03,410 --> 00:24:08,370
come doubt it 8 p.m. after the other
talk to the second letter to every hour

389
00:24:08,370 --> 00:24:11,880
and a you can see that and try to do
seven look inside by doing so

390
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:15,130
in ok

391
00:24:15,130 --> 00:24:18,420
adjust for the completeness there's a
new model

392
00:24:18,420 --> 00:24:21,670
but like the tough competition before
this

393
00:24:21,670 --> 00:24:24,730
about search three times as expensive I
would

394
00:24:24,730 --> 00:24:27,970
first started but would really get the
doctor because paying three times as

395
00:24:27,970 --> 00:24:30,660
much red carpet before squad a lot for
air

396
00:24:30,660 --> 00:24:34,870
official edges him but actually most it
isn't damaged seem to to switch to this

397
00:24:34,870 --> 00:24:37,140
num

398
00:24:37,140 --> 00:24:40,610
and also does essa parliamentary upper

399
00:24:40,610 --> 00:24:43,650
the nice thing is this thing's sailors
are restricted in Germany

400
00:24:43,650 --> 00:24:47,480
but we know we're able to offer the
unique lose a model on handguns because

401
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:49,140
in Germany they only sell into

402
00:24:49,140 --> 00:24:52,940
police officers here I could simply
order one in

403
00:24:52,940 --> 00:24:56,960
get it no but today got on anyone in
Germany because they're people leaking

404
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:59,520
the stock

405
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:02,620
and it was a very silly concept to sell
cups only two

406
00:25:02,620 --> 00:25:06,970
Emir things might get copied can get
around so it's not really I security

407
00:25:06,970 --> 00:25:07,620
concept

408
00:25:07,620 --> 00:25:11,710
okay what you can see him a chip you can
see it as German engineering has

409
00:25:11,710 --> 00:25:13,140
actually six Springs

410
00:25:13,140 --> 00:25:17,760
just like five plates so it's quite
possible to get together

411
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:21,240
in and history suck

412
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:25,750
there's three parts is expected back
each other using the top one

413
00:25:25,750 --> 00:25:30,280
and a sheet of metal between them so
this thing is actually the key has to

414
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:31,149
have three

415
00:25:31,150 --> 00:25:35,800
very thin partisan think you could see
id

416
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:39,290
I movement that is the curator not nice
for me

417
00:25:39,290 --> 00:25:44,370
should have been shoddily keyShot better
but that he is a keen history very sim-

418
00:25:44,370 --> 00:25:50,460
parts coming out of the site collected
actually needed to bring down the park's

419
00:25:50,460 --> 00:25:53,820
the floor and in His Highness that is
not needed

420
00:25:53,820 --> 00:25:57,110
needed to open to double look because
here

421
00:25:57,110 --> 00:26:00,560
there are no sheets at all any 16 bids 6
sick

422
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:05,090
seem which goes in here is able to press
R to block

423
00:26:05,090 --> 00:26:09,750
the only thing her but they did they
made it very hard to put a double lock

424
00:26:09,750 --> 00:26:12,860
actually buyer recounted here

425
00:26:12,860 --> 00:26:16,350
by adding a second spring just to hold
it in place so it's really one of the

426
00:26:16,350 --> 00:26:17,640
six princes

427
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:21,680
throaty governor extra strong but the
hook for me not picking said or

428
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:23,170
something like that

429
00:26:23,170 --> 00:26:27,130
the the push out a double lock and then
use your attitude

430
00:26:27,130 --> 00:26:31,460
syrupy Kelly pension it the other thing
is

431
00:26:31,460 --> 00:26:35,040
they have a sim protection burden you
can see in this picture and

432
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:38,690
this little not here at the top of the
poorer

433
00:26:38,690 --> 00:26:41,840
the idea is if you put in the shin from
the site

434
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:46,790
due to his lights at the bottom of the
cop but it gets caught here by this much

435
00:26:46,790 --> 00:26:50,270
and the Chamber if you tried to put in
the same you got there he allowed to

436
00:26:50,270 --> 00:26:50,830
poor

437
00:26:50,830 --> 00:26:55,689
it against a pole and won't be able to
person he had come in

438
00:26:55,690 --> 00:26:58,920
but of course as we saw in the lock and
governmental

439
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:02,090
you have a bay of manipulating the poll
pressing it down

440
00:27:02,090 --> 00:27:06,440
by tightening your cock so if you
tighten the cop happen much

441
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:09,850
2.0 to press the little and this

442
00:27:09,850 --> 00:27:13,960
and have some protection also is arthur
Baker so put in the point it'll put in

443
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:14,510
the same

444
00:27:14,510 --> 00:27:17,820
the caption so nice idea but

445
00:27:17,820 --> 00:27:20,929
doesn't work so there's a certain

446
00:27:20,930 --> 00:27:24,380
cop which is not a bad business and
basically not develop in Germany or

447
00:27:24,380 --> 00:27:25,690
sewer

448
00:27:25,690 --> 00:27:29,770
because the gonna sing by 2.5 times more
expensive as the one is from before to

449
00:27:29,770 --> 00:27:30,810
be talking like

450
00:27:30,810 --> 00:27:34,700
150 but I'm not prepared and cost made
an ominous invest in Papillion

451
00:27:34,700 --> 00:27:37,970
US cost twenty dollars so it's

452
00:27:37,970 --> 00:27:41,130
not reenter really realistic that gets
used widely

453
00:27:41,130 --> 00:27:44,370
run special forces unit in Germany is
supposed to have it but

454
00:27:44,370 --> 00:27:47,970
nobody ever seen it in real butter think
it's interesting to shower

455
00:27:47,970 --> 00:27:51,020
because they really put some some
engineering in there

456
00:27:51,020 --> 00:27:54,200
it's gone also yes they missed the
constant

457
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:57,270
its use in the funny in

458
00:27:57,270 --> 00:28:01,160
their pension in there did not refer
supposed to save 8%

459
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:05,770
but idk actually Miller so the mill in
these hoes in here in every Bostrom

460
00:28:05,770 --> 00:28:08,889
get out a few in the middle of what they
decide whatever

461
00:28:08,890 --> 00:28:12,870
somebody with a truck and they have nice
details

462
00:28:12,870 --> 00:28:17,580
fixing them yet again the same principle
as we saw in the other one

463
00:28:17,580 --> 00:28:21,429
its one of reports this Dec with medals
between them

464
00:28:21,430 --> 00:28:26,340
which if corrected network the key
operated very unusual baby presence here

465
00:28:26,340 --> 00:28:29,430
with a very short lever into every for
the

466
00:28:29,430 --> 00:28:32,450
actual every two years shorter than the
one of the spring for you need quite

467
00:28:32,450 --> 00:28:34,360
some forced to get down the

468
00:28:34,360 --> 00:28:37,840
good don't report and the important
detail is

469
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:41,790
this mechanism in his phone think is
always nice to see that because usually

470
00:28:41,790 --> 00:28:43,270
they don't show you the details

471
00:28:43,270 --> 00:28:46,629
in and the thing with

472
00:28:46,630 --> 00:28:51,350
hearings small gaps two sheets of metal
continues though president the blocking

473
00:28:51,350 --> 00:28:53,370
barking you could see before

474
00:28:53,370 --> 00:28:58,450
this is this thing is can also activate
it was a finger in Preston

475
00:28:58,450 --> 00:29:02,910
30 she's got his 04 to be a committed to
block you are still need is three

476
00:29:02,910 --> 00:29:07,110
three-minute part and to make it even
more difficult if you look here

477
00:29:07,110 --> 00:29:10,160
it again

478
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:14,980
this little notch but not enough to
simply be put this to push this

479
00:29:14,980 --> 00:29:19,220
in because that you possibly could be
just one of the parks in person voting

480
00:29:19,220 --> 00:29:19,820
in

481
00:29:19,820 --> 00:29:22,870
but the key he comes from here and has
to put it

482
00:29:22,870 --> 00:29:27,610
first down and then away so that's
really hard to do this

483
00:29:27,610 --> 00:29:31,630
there this one is looking to us for
example you can do it one by one so

484
00:29:31,630 --> 00:29:33,750
trying the first read the second and

485
00:29:33,750 --> 00:29:37,640
disperse basically like lockpicking does
because you don't know which one bill

486
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:41,180
they go out first we have or three again
again and again this

487
00:29:41,180 --> 00:29:44,550
the band attention to something like
that but the

488
00:29:44,550 --> 00:29:48,230
actually reading working quite well as a
prevention a free eight-week it doesn't

489
00:29:48,230 --> 00:29:50,390
look that but the other should have done
to

490
00:29:50,390 --> 00:29:53,610
and the other thing is that the shim
prevention this time is

491
00:29:53,610 --> 00:29:57,240
in the housing so you would be the board
games this is not here

492
00:29:57,240 --> 00:30:01,130
the picture shim and this doesn't go
down when you put in the boat

493
00:30:01,130 --> 00:30:05,450
you can still should if you bend your
shame in the play possible before

494
00:30:05,450 --> 00:30:09,490
so it really has to go typable but if
you do that too much could be get of

495
00:30:09,490 --> 00:30:10,150
course

496
00:30:10,150 --> 00:30:15,420
in get caught by the tease sorry we have
to have to follow the shape of the both

497
00:30:15,420 --> 00:30:19,840
it shouldn't be tried it and it has to
be very my chin because its midnight

498
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:22,020
opening soon under the commercial since
a combined

499
00:30:22,020 --> 00:30:25,850
don't ever so that the Jews acquired
better bing.com

500
00:30:25,850 --> 00:30:30,570
given that it has unusual but of course
broadcast the same key

501
00:30:30,570 --> 00:30:33,629
but is not used endeavor for real so

502
00:30:33,630 --> 00:30:37,540
I think it was just interesting to
shower

503
00:30:37,540 --> 00:30:43,830
possibly if the recession is over
everybody the good work

504
00:30:43,830 --> 00:30:47,189
your talking we're going to get one and
coming back with us.

505
00:30:47,190 --> 00:30:51,760
so poor sings possibly more important
for the Department of Public Security

506
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:56,010
just got red cock just don't have the
guts and cup with going many years into

507
00:30:56,010 --> 00:30:57,150
the past

508
00:30:57,150 --> 00:31:00,780
this a paid member under can possibly
related to you again

509
00:31:00,780 --> 00:31:04,610
look it up on the Internet as a pet in
and the trust

510
00:31:04,610 --> 00:31:08,590
announced years ago is the solution for
all these problems with

511
00:31:08,590 --> 00:31:13,270
confused keys with shaming basically be
the answer to everything

512
00:31:13,270 --> 00:31:16,420
a single bid times a great at-bat Syrian

513
00:31:16,420 --> 00:31:20,290
whatever you need back there's a problem
the inventors

514
00:31:20,290 --> 00:31:23,530
themselves YouTube other ok

515
00:31:23,530 --> 00:31:26,780
about who registered to patent online as
Inc

516
00:31:26,780 --> 00:31:31,020
I i repair a try to repeal of papers
about it

517
00:31:31,020 --> 00:31:35,400
and basically was the person who founded
the company

518
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:39,380
pursued by the inventor of the comp
profiling in the patents

519
00:31:39,380 --> 00:31:42,760
because by the pattens shows the inside
running

520
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:45,930
but she wanted to keep secrets who this
is this

521
00:31:45,930 --> 00:31:49,260
but you shouldn't even

522
00:31:49,260 --> 00:31:52,800
it's an unusual mechanism this them

523
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:57,030
release here pushed me look so shannon
is not possible because

524
00:31:57,030 --> 00:32:00,889
any simply go here in with its stock
stock between the ears

525
00:32:00,890 --> 00:32:04,410
looking is done here by this shaped pin

526
00:32:04,410 --> 00:32:09,520
bridges bamut in one direction so by
moving the ball with this turns

527
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:13,370
this way and push it has been in

528
00:32:13,370 --> 00:32:17,750
and the key goes in here and moved this
man apart

529
00:32:17,750 --> 00:32:21,100
it can have three positions the one is
it going over there

530
00:32:21,100 --> 00:32:27,340
then this thing is free to move them the
position is free to move taken with Ben

531
00:32:27,340 --> 00:32:30,800
if you put it even more like using the
buttons based

532
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:35,500
then it's removed from the readers and
did just things really been

533
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:39,250
and if you put into this position this
spring here but i wouldnt

534
00:32:39,250 --> 00:32:42,780
I would strong enough to prevent the
force coming in from this but if

535
00:32:42,780 --> 00:32:46,610
it's really bed gearing this thing it's
very hard force

536
00:32:46,610 --> 00:32:50,430
would be needed to get it out it holds
it close completely so that the

537
00:32:50,430 --> 00:32:54,760
double organs opening an all in one part
quite a clever do something

538
00:32:54,760 --> 00:32:58,660
but as they stood themselves and
everything ok say

539
00:32:58,660 --> 00:33:02,090
possible that this is the second downs
producing it again so if

540
00:33:02,090 --> 00:33:05,320
to be part of the problem security want
to bicycle cops they can order to apply

541
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:06,270
for some

542
00:33:06,270 --> 00:33:09,530
but none have delivered yet so this cup
actually bus

543
00:33:09,530 --> 00:33:14,310
not exist at all nobody has heard so
it's very difficult to make

544
00:33:14,310 --> 00:33:17,730
maybe keep a record that would look like
this

545
00:33:17,730 --> 00:33:24,290
ok so if you look at that and have a
good look like this

546
00:33:24,290 --> 00:33:28,210
ok and if you would look at the key it
would be around saying

547
00:33:28,210 --> 00:33:31,430
ok Mitch 300 members in that

548
00:33:31,430 --> 00:33:34,670
began later tried to take steps that
measurements are that cup

549
00:33:34,670 --> 00:33:39,830
if the editor and tried to occur try to
find out the date was it is an amazing

550
00:33:39,830 --> 00:33:44,160
but the idea not that bad because it was
like this rainy but around

551
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:47,260
criminal background so incompetently
grabbed

552
00:33:47,260 --> 00:33:50,980
it has the same diameter in all
directions so moving around

553
00:33:50,980 --> 00:33:54,960
listed fixed size would regularly have
to reproduce something like that

554
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:58,110
but he was with the printer can do it we
have to try that ok

555
00:33:58,110 --> 00:34:03,530
but of course we would have to get the
comfort that bit I began to

556
00:34:03,530 --> 00:34:08,270
in

557
00:34:08,270 --> 00:34:11,929
there you see the detail again

558
00:34:11,929 --> 00:34:15,790
so this is the the looking part
independent petroleum

559
00:34:15,790 --> 00:34:20,389
it looks like differently the planned
obviously to test something with three

560
00:34:20,389 --> 00:34:23,600
three mil not just in that around part
but would

561
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:27,879
it's the same the same idea basically
did have something to fit on this poll

562
00:34:27,879 --> 00:34:32,239
and to turn into Springs are supposed to
be very hard in that

563
00:34:32,240 --> 00:34:36,340
so it's really cried some force me to
think that might also be a problem for

564
00:34:36,340 --> 00:34:41,030
for 3d printing this key or something
and immature 3d printing he's

565
00:34:41,030 --> 00:34:44,230
is it on a good idea but we will see
that

566
00:34:44,230 --> 00:34:47,810
okay there's another and coming want to
talk about this hope you will like most

567
00:34:47,810 --> 00:34:49,549
because I really like that

568
00:34:49,550 --> 00:34:52,640
this is the dredges men from the company
in

569
00:34:52,639 --> 00:34:57,009
it's really nice is a coating is is from
there we have to be able to contain

570
00:34:57,010 --> 00:35:01,870
this year's incident and restrain the
physically violent the dangers president

571
00:35:01,870 --> 00:35:05,960
but reserve physically then trigger
under the authority is able to bodziak

572
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:07,960
up that look

573
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:11,730
security have developed a revolutionary
companies restrained kid

574
00:35:11,730 --> 00:35:16,780
Pacific ever and I'm and it's already in
startin somethin broadcaster Alan

575
00:35:16,780 --> 00:35:19,880
I tried to find how to live plain
hearsay headed they had

576
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:25,340
obviously in Mr on board but he didn't
want to come in and show me im

577
00:35:25,340 --> 00:35:29,220
ok but that supposed to look like this
ok

578
00:35:29,220 --> 00:35:33,760
is the head covered with a it said it
would save it has a very light rain here

579
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:37,070
so it get who up to one of the straps
this trip

580
00:35:37,070 --> 00:35:40,670
actually goes below the chair and San up
the

581
00:35:40,670 --> 00:35:44,990
three part of the chair of the Appleseed
and this goes around your

582
00:35:44,990 --> 00:35:48,510
Chester Zoo you some dough sitting in a
chair being restrained to the chair and

583
00:35:48,510 --> 00:35:50,240
having the cock

584
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:53,400
their down by the by the other better

585
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:58,030
the kitchen knives and exploration
having the CDC said the possibly

586
00:35:58,030 --> 00:36:01,970
potentially escalators there sometime
which has some nice pictures and some

587
00:36:01,970 --> 00:36:03,490
nice comments

588
00:36:03,490 --> 00:36:07,310
about how to use it like very blessed
team to tighten the ballot and stuff

589
00:36:07,310 --> 00:36:08,040
like that

590
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:12,009
there very very motivating for the for
the ACA

591
00:36:12,010 --> 00:36:16,330
true to restrain the potentially
dangerous now is included

592
00:36:16,330 --> 00:36:19,360
the invitations prison

593
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:22,780
the interstices interesting thing about
is this is that there's a high-security

594
00:36:22,780 --> 00:36:24,240
prison

595
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:27,330
which contains the so-called Chuckie
Taylor and cups

596
00:36:27,330 --> 00:36:30,500
there's also a version which contained
standard handcuffs

597
00:36:30,500 --> 00:36:34,150
but we know already that Tesla past the
keeper standard handcuffed and of course

598
00:36:34,150 --> 00:36:34,730
we know but

599
00:36:34,730 --> 00:36:37,690
everything we do they won't find the
best to keep when you're boarding the

600
00:36:37,690 --> 00:36:38,690
plane

601
00:36:38,690 --> 00:36:42,400
so for the retainers this a problem
because the key is

602
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:45,820
sale restricted it this real effort to
block so

603
00:36:45,820 --> 00:36:49,490
if you know what a chopper is it's quite
difficult to pick a lot but idk and

604
00:36:49,490 --> 00:36:51,670
picked you can try later in the

605
00:36:51,670 --> 00:36:55,950
picking every hour but thats actually
very very difficult lock to open

606
00:36:55,950 --> 00:36:58,960
and the key is not available to the to
the general public

607
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:02,740
because of course discovered only sold
by some UK company and they're very

608
00:37:02,740 --> 00:37:05,120
strict about which is held to and
everything

609
00:37:05,120 --> 00:37:08,080
see would first have to get the
measurements and everything very good

610
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:11,540
for them

611
00:37:11,540 --> 00:37:15,170
psych

612
00:37:15,170 --> 00:37:20,310
there's a green-flag runs felon bounder
I have to live because somebody

613
00:37:20,310 --> 00:37:25,279
ok on a better we have to check that
that sounds very dangerous weapon

614
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:28,870
somebody wholeheartedly are selling
dreams got down there was supposed to be

615
00:37:28,870 --> 00:37:29,380
britain's

616
00:37:29,380 --> 00:37:32,890
for chopper I'm not I'm not sure what it
means that I have to

617
00:37:32,890 --> 00:37:36,140
have to call my supervisor ok

618
00:37:36,140 --> 00:37:39,600
sewer but but the meat has to do
something bad would i mentioned in the

619
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:40,589
beginning

620
00:37:40,589 --> 00:37:43,710
but these criminals do today this is the
computer aided

621
00:37:43,710 --> 00:37:47,240
key replication this is a really nasty
thing because

622
00:37:47,240 --> 00:37:50,609
or the secret keys we have developed for
the handcuffs the company that develops

623
00:37:50,609 --> 00:37:51,520
farce

624
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:55,070
this hey before government funding of
course air

625
00:37:55,070 --> 00:37:58,690
are based on the concept that nobody has
this key

626
00:37:58,690 --> 00:38:02,450
so if it would be replicated is it would
be shared on the Internet it would be a

627
00:38:02,450 --> 00:38:03,620
catastrophe

628
00:38:03,620 --> 00:38:07,390
you shouldn't you should really rely on
such a concept so always assume that the

629
00:38:07,390 --> 00:38:08,720
criminals have the key you should

630
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:13,500
you should know that as in officer of
the open Security Department

631
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:17,780
her 3d printing at one of the variations
two-room

632
00:38:17,780 --> 00:38:22,760
third computer-aided key replication and
luckily it didn't it acid to Dutch

633
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:27,410
police because there was this Dutch have
attempted in 2009

634
00:38:27,410 --> 00:38:30,810
and some crazy guy presented as 3d
printed

635
00:38:30,810 --> 00:38:35,870
keyboard there very restricted Turkey
and cut its core service real ever catch

636
00:38:35,870 --> 00:38:37,660
a block very small one with

637
00:38:37,660 --> 00:38:41,410
but only two key code sows up to an hour
but still is

638
00:38:41,410 --> 00:38:44,569
the word what I said before plies it's
very hard to pick you need to

639
00:38:44,570 --> 00:38:48,910
pics and vid individual part of it so
it's actually a lot picking needed to to

640
00:38:48,910 --> 00:38:50,350
open did care

641
00:38:50,350 --> 00:38:53,500
the comment the key could basically not
by by the general public

642
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:56,830
in so that really was a problem

643
00:38:56,830 --> 00:39:00,410
and of course it was all over the
internet that's that's the real problem

644
00:39:00,410 --> 00:39:01,839
this is tough

645
00:39:01,839 --> 00:39:05,330
someone does it and convince them in
Holland where nobody cares

646
00:39:05,330 --> 00:39:08,900
some people put up the internet and then
is everywhere

647
00:39:08,900 --> 00:39:12,089
so that's that's really was nice though
there had to be a reaction needed

648
00:39:12,089 --> 00:39:15,650
in and Dutch police there

649
00:39:15,650 --> 00:39:19,000
no doubt in order for six thousand you
had come

650
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:22,560
they want to buy power this an option
for 45 sound more so

651
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:26,150
because the old ones are going out and
everything there was there was no

652
00:39:26,150 --> 00:39:27,060
mention of the

653
00:39:27,060 --> 00:39:31,290
incident but of course you wouldn't want
to tell anybody about that

654
00:39:31,290 --> 00:39:35,790
the funniest part of our requirements is
that it specifies they can only be

655
00:39:35,790 --> 00:39:38,259
opened with the correct key

656
00:39:38,260 --> 00:39:42,570
and and the good thing about that this
requirement is very easy to fulfill our

657
00:39:42,570 --> 00:39:46,570
because every lockers only opened with
the current key the wrong key won't open

658
00:39:46,570 --> 00:39:49,930
it

659
00:39:49,930 --> 00:39:53,640
ok so I I would simply say the 3d
printed

660
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:57,210
he is the is the correct key it opens
the cops a comfortable fit the

661
00:39:57,210 --> 00:39:58,630
specification

662
00:39:58,630 --> 00:40:02,609
and they don't have to buy the new one
so save the Dutch people some money but

663
00:40:02,609 --> 00:40:06,460
busy for that I don't know if you know
no bari bari from

664
00:40:06,460 --> 00:40:10,420
Toolroom yet there has to be led by
blocking he also blocked about this

665
00:40:10,420 --> 00:40:15,350
the thing that the top country have a
new search for 3d-printed handcuff keys

666
00:40:15,350 --> 00:40:18,480
and then he had a very interesting
recommendation to the Dutch police

667
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:22,390
in

668
00:40:22,390 --> 00:40:25,839
I'm not sure with Israeli guy is but

669
00:40:25,839 --> 00:40:30,650
aspires I know they haven't asked him
yet ok

670
00:40:30,650 --> 00:40:35,460
so the Megabus possibly a bit boring and
was looking for new targets

671
00:40:35,460 --> 00:40:38,760
ok do remember that really the

672
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:45,630
restraint as road before the problem it
is very difficult to get

673
00:40:45,630 --> 00:40:50,710
ok but but luckily I don't know if you
know cannot come but he didn't need his

674
00:40:50,710 --> 00:40:51,339
private jet

675
00:40:51,339 --> 00:40:54,799
anymore

676
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:58,940
and and is going to have the power to be
made to get money for his charity

677
00:40:58,940 --> 00:41:02,380
them

678
00:41:02,380 --> 00:41:07,089
so you guys is the this kid just as nice
chap and power

679
00:41:07,089 --> 00:41:10,160
between going to be two before work
having the triblock

680
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:14,009
this handbook is also available with
Mama chain from from Chapter stole a

681
00:41:14,010 --> 00:41:16,359
limited basically used in the UK

682
00:41:16,359 --> 00:41:20,150
so I know done with Julius arms as
Saunders watching right now

683
00:41:20,150 --> 00:41:25,470
but that's probably something you should
look out for ok

684
00:41:25,470 --> 00:41:29,859
okay so I did did took another ride from
from the UK im

685
00:41:29,859 --> 00:41:32,950
open up and let them know if you can
really see but you can see better down

686
00:41:32,950 --> 00:41:34,200
there so again

687
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:37,480
dozens as a mechanism and put some
plexiglas on it so you can

688
00:41:37,480 --> 00:41:40,700
look inside to see what actually
happening here sry

689
00:41:40,700 --> 00:41:44,490
claims about each other building a chop
block so these have to be pressed down

690
00:41:44,490 --> 00:41:47,730
by the correct key code which is
basically like stairs

691
00:41:47,730 --> 00:41:52,140
and if they passed out orders great type
it with Howard chapter Burke

692
00:41:52,140 --> 00:41:55,339
as don't think you can really see good
here but later in the group will be able

693
00:41:55,339 --> 00:41:56,259
to

694
00:41:56,260 --> 00:42:01,290
have a look at it if you press down the
baby but you need thumbs bear shaped

695
00:42:01,290 --> 00:42:02,160
thing

696
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:05,480
which presses down to the correct
adjustments he sings

697
00:42:05,480 --> 00:42:09,080
my first then attend both look around
you

698
00:42:09,080 --> 00:42:12,380
improvise and this from a credit card in

699
00:42:12,380 --> 00:42:15,609
I would guess the best that can be cut
easily I cut my finger first gonna come

700
00:42:15,609 --> 00:42:18,360
to keep them

701
00:42:18,360 --> 00:42:21,570
sonya is originally he sorry it put
admitted by supersede

702
00:42:21,570 --> 00:42:24,600
there's one part here to prague actually
moving

703
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:27,760
the mechanism of the lock and then just
three stairs

704
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:31,740
which are a key code says he's press the
three

705
00:42:31,740 --> 00:42:35,750
then part metal to the correct item

706
00:42:35,750 --> 00:42:40,210
at this one really operate my credit
card keep red card he was able to

707
00:42:40,210 --> 00:42:41,490
operate the lock

708
00:42:41,490 --> 00:42:45,520
it was a bit worried blooper reel opens
the cop because you have to put down a

709
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:47,200
spring then

710
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:50,920
and accordingly to prosper that
indicated that bend if you will

711
00:42:50,920 --> 00:42:54,180
don't have anything else except for
credit card must be the second credit

712
00:42:54,180 --> 00:42:54,690
card

713
00:42:54,690 --> 00:42:57,760
I think if you take to a credit card and
perhaps a red key

714
00:42:57,760 --> 00:43:02,010
put them together it might work so as
long as you don't have to credit cards

715
00:43:02,010 --> 00:43:02,320
and

716
00:43:02,320 --> 00:43:06,160
today that is has never seen that many
people here

717
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:10,069
the exit button to for computer-aided
purification so I took you can't

718
00:43:10,070 --> 00:43:14,880
cuba is a to the drone program is open
source and always got stuck

719
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:18,020
so you can decide to keep it had to get
get the measurement from the original

720
00:43:18,020 --> 00:43:18,450
keep

721
00:43:18,450 --> 00:43:22,650
but a misuses by the turn up somewhere
in the

722
00:43:22,650 --> 00:43:26,270
remember so you have to be there

723
00:43:26,270 --> 00:43:31,190
and have a 24-hour from A to D model
dozen very easy way to get to is really

724
00:43:31,190 --> 00:43:32,520
murderer

725
00:43:32,520 --> 00:43:36,980
meeting tonight stop required open
escaped that's really a single

726
00:43:36,980 --> 00:43:40,920
of one line of code but settling extrude
my big

727
00:43:40,920 --> 00:43:45,740
vibe is the head of 2.0 meters and a
good is nice 3d model

728
00:43:45,740 --> 00:43:48,960
a flat keep of course original key

729
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:53,170
is not letting his part but rounded but
that doesn't really matter important is

730
00:43:53,170 --> 00:43:55,690
that they can turn it inside the route
hold

731
00:43:55,690 --> 00:43:59,310
so I actually did some calculations with
Pete address and everything

732
00:43:59,310 --> 00:44:02,770
food fight are prepared for formally
meet a round hole and a

733
00:44:02,770 --> 00:44:06,890
to me to hide key how long have to be
make it is going to enter an artist

734
00:44:06,890 --> 00:44:10,060
point out it's about 3.5 meters bit sick
happier for

735
00:44:10,060 --> 00:44:13,450
returning but turned out as or not that
important because they have quite the

736
00:44:13,450 --> 00:44:14,920
movement inside the keynote

737
00:44:14,920 --> 00:44:17,960
ok so from there to go to the 3d printer
and get that

738
00:44:17,960 --> 00:44:21,670
in and the funny thing is that actually
works

739
00:44:21,670 --> 00:44:26,150
your I have to look I think this would
happen here

740
00:44:26,150 --> 00:44:33,150
if you take it as a 3d-printed

741
00:44:33,570 --> 00:44:36,850
in mind could become like this store
under after had to cut it off the

742
00:44:36,850 --> 00:44:38,810
rafters packed them

743
00:44:38,810 --> 00:44:41,870
by some Burke

744
00:44:41,870 --> 00:44:46,920
and a new taxes last vestige been

745
00:44:46,920 --> 00:44:50,790
your presidency the double locking
mechanism so you see a possible move the

746
00:44:50,790 --> 00:44:54,320
maybe because they don't need any force
for to just perfectly open slot and

747
00:44:54,320 --> 00:44:55,490
moved on to that looking back

748
00:44:55,490 --> 00:44:59,410
son I could already Schmid but ben
Phillips

749
00:44:59,410 --> 00:45:06,410
and opens way so now I actually have the
best the key

750
00:45:09,820 --> 00:45:14,570
for my Aline restraints which actually
the nice thing to have because I can

751
00:45:14,570 --> 00:45:17,920
always carry on Amazon for example you
can carry your best the keys without

752
00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:18,610
having to

753
00:45:18,610 --> 00:45:21,870
has less is a treaty to show your ID and
everything just brought the plane was

754
00:45:21,870 --> 00:45:22,460
your keys

755
00:45:22,460 --> 00:45:26,950
and nobody will bother you missus even
better to keep your identity as the MRC

756
00:45:26,950 --> 00:45:29,290
critter

757
00:45:29,290 --> 00:45:34,320
sewer 3d printer

758
00:45:34,320 --> 00:45:38,570
every time consuming process if I would
like to produce many of his keys

759
00:45:38,570 --> 00:45:41,920
and cut them off the raft but they have
machines down service don't need the

760
00:45:41,920 --> 00:45:42,570
raft

761
00:45:42,570 --> 00:45:46,290
third attributed to talk about is the
need like five minutes perky and heating

762
00:45:46,290 --> 00:45:47,220
and cooling down its

763
00:45:47,220 --> 00:45:51,710
it by some groups so desolate accredited
most part of this really do it yourself

764
00:45:51,710 --> 00:45:52,470
community

765
00:45:52,470 --> 00:45:56,030
been quite expensive but they are around
people use them

766
00:45:56,030 --> 00:45:59,760
and printing like to thank you know
whatever it is just takes

767
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:02,730
two minutes or three minutes or
something like that as a nice thing is

768
00:46:02,730 --> 00:46:06,430
they actually could directly use the DX
effort to produce for this really key

769
00:46:06,430 --> 00:46:10,990
and import it with this week the printer
in by deep like

770
00:46:10,990 --> 00:46:14,220
so of course the pre-printed he has a BS

771
00:46:14,220 --> 00:46:18,750
and there's no secret bless acrylic
glass is much different than the ABS

772
00:46:18,750 --> 00:46:22,300
but there's also quite hard our

773
00:46:22,300 --> 00:46:26,690
somewhere to try to drugs again possibly
have one here

774
00:46:26,690 --> 00:46:33,690
of it works basically the same as the
key before except that it will get

775
00:46:33,710 --> 00:46:34,860
better

776
00:46:34,860 --> 00:46:38,310
but it can break that Seahawk the
downturn

777
00:46:38,310 --> 00:46:41,200
but if you don't push too hard it
doesn't break and it really works

778
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:41,770
flawless

779
00:46:41,770 --> 00:46:44,970
ok so I thought that's a nice thing to

780
00:46:44,970 --> 00:46:49,700
could happen that the laser-guided is a
more

781
00:46:49,700 --> 00:46:51,830
ok

782
00:46:51,830 --> 00:46:55,700
sorry babe somebody in if somebody stole
our

783
00:46:55,700 --> 00:47:00,030
strange dreams things down there for
sale but they might have lied

784
00:47:00,030 --> 00:47:05,410
ok am I'm not really sure if it's
something you really have to have

785
00:47:05,410 --> 00:47:09,770
but at at the sea apparent it's your big
boobs down in the in the hall

786
00:47:09,770 --> 00:47:13,450
air I are selling a few of those is a
nice

787
00:47:13,450 --> 00:47:16,970
remember remember item for your
conference and has a very nice leather

788
00:47:16,970 --> 00:47:17,500
codpiece

789
00:47:17,500 --> 00:47:21,280
if you really use that you have to be
careful not to break it off so

790
00:47:21,280 --> 00:47:25,750
don't really put push hard on the
opening bid strong enough and the Cubs

791
00:47:25,750 --> 00:47:29,730
opens not strong enough for much more
forced

792
00:47:29,730 --> 00:47:34,300
sewer the board really well I think in

793
00:47:34,300 --> 00:47:38,250
the so restored do some ok

794
00:47:38,250 --> 00:47:42,030
you remember we had in this presentation
to other cast per share highly

795
00:47:42,030 --> 00:47:44,380
restricted government only secret keys

796
00:47:44,380 --> 00:47:50,530
our for this year geneticists new German
had cops accused a number nine

797
00:47:50,530 --> 00:47:54,730
and has been only cuff nobody has the
problem is

798
00:47:54,730 --> 00:48:01,730
in the basically over our

799
00:48:03,750 --> 00:48:07,630
and there's a nice singapore is a German
offices among US

800
00:48:07,630 --> 00:48:11,160
that's a good one bud Burberry Road

801
00:48:11,160 --> 00:48:14,490
because it unable to open the double
lock as I said the

802
00:48:14,490 --> 00:48:17,980
German engineers added too much Springs
for

803
00:48:17,980 --> 00:48:21,500
everything so it's so hard to assemble
thing and

804
00:48:21,500 --> 00:48:24,730
that when you come first two open-ended
acrylic glass break

805
00:48:24,730 --> 00:48:28,580
all the time have been trying with
another guy from from the maker but her

806
00:48:28,580 --> 00:48:30,509
bruised under printer

807
00:48:30,510 --> 00:48:34,690
ABS part which only open to double or
because for the number locking mechanism

808
00:48:34,690 --> 00:48:35,119
the

809
00:48:35,119 --> 00:48:39,150
printer is not find enough is really the
know if you can see it here but feared

810
00:48:39,150 --> 00:48:42,260
its three very Singh good one really
Mitchell

811
00:48:42,260 --> 00:48:46,290
0.8 or something and three parts here

812
00:48:46,290 --> 00:48:49,770
so that that is best done with a laser
cutter but the other side which

813
00:48:49,770 --> 00:48:53,100
only open to double ok so some space
this possibly can be printed

814
00:48:53,100 --> 00:48:56,700
so the color ideas to printer RR opening
tour

815
00:48:56,700 --> 00:48:59,940
which over to double up and then if the
laser cut key to open the copper

816
00:48:59,940 --> 00:49:06,940
but so far the doesn't really work out
the other thing I see below week off

817
00:49:19,599 --> 00:49:22,900
which originally comes with an ice pick
even the said own

818
00:49:22,900 --> 00:49:27,410
also only so to the Special Forces third
the good ability to hackers but that's a

819
00:49:27,410 --> 00:49:28,109
good thing

820
00:49:28,109 --> 00:49:35,109
we just hope that they don't get the
measurements and I have a question the

821
00:49:35,219 --> 00:49:36,329
five sacred

822
00:49:36,329 --> 00:49:41,239
the best thing about those is in

823
00:49:41,239 --> 00:49:44,880
that it has entered most already
registered he needs a lot of course

824
00:49:44,880 --> 00:49:48,239
to to open the cock and so here's the
risk of breaking his

825
00:49:48,239 --> 00:49:51,329
quite high you really have to could be
careful push

826
00:49:51,329 --> 00:49:55,459
in a little because pushing in actually
pushes the city's down

827
00:49:55,459 --> 00:49:59,449
so you that work for the prosecutor
private boat doesn't have to be applied

828
00:49:59,449 --> 00:49:59,979
with the

829
00:49:59,979 --> 00:50:03,579
this a key but eventually it works in

830
00:50:03,579 --> 00:50:10,579
from his car

831
00:50:11,180 --> 00:50:14,819
this this ki subah bhi don't have seen
nine around down there but possibly some

832
00:50:14,819 --> 00:50:15,459
Miller

833
00:50:15,459 --> 00:50:19,509
turn up I don't know for the visitors
obstruction Germany

834
00:50:19,509 --> 00:50:22,989
in 10 years whenever the set is over the
devices cock

835
00:50:22,989 --> 00:50:26,369
or just great and everybody has a laser
cutter and cut his own keys

836
00:50:26,369 --> 00:50:30,109
in okay ever told you already

837
00:50:30,109 --> 00:50:36,619
we've been doing good Rex object 20 112
so you have some time to get down and we

838
00:50:36,619 --> 00:50:38,739
have some time to get down because
there's no work

839
00:50:38,739 --> 00:50:43,339
after my talk the talk about mastering
master key systems but David column

840
00:50:43,339 --> 00:50:47,819
which I really recommend to everybody
interested in Kiki systems key system

841
00:50:47,819 --> 00:50:48,709
security

842
00:50:48,709 --> 00:50:54,119
getting masa keys to building everything
and the dog didn't want to to have to

843
00:50:54,119 --> 00:50:58,229
decide to go to the truck shop about to
the talk the body to talk and then go to

844
00:50:58,229 --> 00:51:00,279
overcome donder

845
00:51:00,279 --> 00:51:03,469
and tired the keys and look in the
mirror

846
00:51:03,469 --> 00:51:10,469
and that sentiment our go well thank you
for listening

847
00:51:13,529 --> 00:51:18,189
made for questions I'm big ambitions and
thank everybody who helped me bring cups

848
00:51:18,189 --> 00:51:19,928
bringing stuff that doesn't exist

849
00:51:19,929 --> 00:51:23,779
looks down from the police department
everything so other any questions

850
00:51:23,779 --> 00:51:29,689
bf I leave minutes mister professions

851
00:51:29,689 --> 00:51:33,549
I don't know but you have to come but I
don't see anything I know we have nine

852
00:51:33,549 --> 00:51:39,150
just a microphone and ambling really
answering any had 100 questions you

853
00:51:39,150 --> 00:51:39,579
might have

854
00:51:39,579 --> 00:51:43,079
home say what is

855
00:51:43,079 --> 00:51:48,859
way have raised to make them talk with
electric shocks and what they mean

856
00:51:48,859 --> 00:51:52,410
yeah okay we have one question

857
00:51:52,410 --> 00:51:55,939
are no hun do you have anything
interesting on zip ties site

858
00:51:55,939 --> 00:51:59,359
as it eyes a blessing a.m. CNN

859
00:51:59,359 --> 00:52:04,549
I what tired and he was talking about
and i think is from the Occupy Wall

860
00:52:04,549 --> 00:52:05,459
Street movement

861
00:52:05,459 --> 00:52:08,529
a and he's asking about the tires

862
00:52:08,529 --> 00:52:13,619
and a very simple answer to that and
that is this tool

863
00:52:13,619 --> 00:52:17,999
this dude is hard to believe police
officers so they can remove plastic

864
00:52:17,999 --> 00:52:19,140
commissar

865
00:52:19,140 --> 00:52:22,578
the risk of injury and it doesn't look
very nice like

866
00:52:22,579 --> 00:52:26,900
it also has a very small part of metal
inside third but maybe not really

867
00:52:26,900 --> 00:52:29,979
recognized by metal detector so if you
have that in your pocket on your

868
00:52:29,979 --> 00:52:34,009
occupied demonstration whatever it be
possible but reckon I did

869
00:52:34,009 --> 00:52:39,410
and the they would get it I goes in here
present the desert get divided

870
00:52:39,410 --> 00:52:43,390
and there's no risk of injury so getting
your police shot one of the

871
00:52:43,390 --> 00:52:46,469
K but I cutters possibly the best answer
for you next

872
00:52:46,469 --> 00:52:50,839
Occupy movement other anymore questions
over who asked the question

873
00:52:50,839 --> 00:52:56,538
I decided to get one left the key to
play requested to come up here

874
00:52:56,539 --> 00:52:59,689
in

875
00:52:59,689 --> 00:53:03,339
and get your original tried out
undetected

876
00:53:03,339 --> 00:53:07,160
tried out under talk best the QF know
you can filter the best thing for

877
00:53:07,160 --> 00:53:11,239
much you so if there is another question

878
00:53:11,239 --> 00:53:15,160
and even if it I can make a point just
to get the key I don't have to be clever

879
00:53:15,160 --> 00:53:15,719
sir

880
00:53:15,719 --> 00:53:19,259
its not clever does not strengthen other

881
00:53:19,259 --> 00:53:23,499
you have the problem with using up poly
accolade when you're using a laser

882
00:53:23,499 --> 00:53:25,099
cutter that it's a brittle plastic

883
00:53:25,099 --> 00:53:28,599
I'm will ask others cut polycarbonate

884
00:53:28,599 --> 00:53:32,319
home which is a much more resilient
stronger plastic

885
00:53:32,319 --> 00:53:36,288
yeah I'm not really an expert in the
leather cutting plastic

886
00:53:36,289 --> 00:53:41,549
however early look at a guy aid said we
couldn't cut PVC vehicle couldn't had

887
00:53:41,549 --> 00:53:43,429
ABS because it was made in too much

888
00:53:43,429 --> 00:53:47,349
and I didn't have any other material but
that's something I was was planning to

889
00:53:47,349 --> 00:53:48,079
look into

890
00:53:48,079 --> 00:53:51,739
gonna try polycarbonate polycarbonate
yeah it's a

891
00:53:51,739 --> 00:53:55,969
12 brennan's is Lex and it's what the US
travel exelon oh yeah is for you know

892
00:53:55,969 --> 00:53:59,390
I jet cut canopies and cockpit so it's
very resilient

893
00:53:59,390 --> 00:54:02,549
shock resistance not brittle yeah that
that's one of the things I was was

894
00:54:02,549 --> 00:54:04,099
planning to Benjamin true

895
00:54:04,099 --> 00:54:07,900
put more more research into that because
the laser cutting thing was really done

896
00:54:07,900 --> 00:54:11,410
in the last week so it but thanks for
the information and event of course to

897
00:54:11,410 --> 00:54:12,709
get the best the keeper that

898
00:54:12,709 --> 00:54:19,709
been okay do we have a third question I
have a few more key here

899
00:54:20,869 --> 00:54:23,579
there's one but could go to the
microphone because I don't let the buses

900
00:54:23,579 --> 00:54:24,749
n

901
00:54:24,749 --> 00:54:29,140
you known

902
00:54:29,140 --> 00:54:33,038
witch hunts are gonna be used on you was
the best way to conceal them in

903
00:54:33,039 --> 00:54:37,209
if your hands are behind the back how do
you gamma oh no no

904
00:54:37,209 --> 00:54:40,829
basically the moon in most cases the end
up in fact would be used on you so it's

905
00:54:40,829 --> 00:54:43,759
really one of those American versions
with use a standard key

906
00:54:43,759 --> 00:54:47,839
so everything ritual in the back of
course is a good idea to try to keep

907
00:54:47,839 --> 00:54:51,299
fight them in my car theft by comes back
they're very quick Susie

908
00:54:51,299 --> 00:54:54,859
seeger completely from the other side of
but home don't tell you

909
00:54:54,859 --> 00:54:58,699
vector dude because just be creative and
be more creative than the present

910
00:54:58,699 --> 00:54:59,349
judging you

911
00:54:59,349 --> 00:55:03,699
but you've got to be some bad Mexican
guy is usually open security officers

912
00:55:03,699 --> 00:55:07,140
okay I'm you get home

913
00:55:07,140 --> 00:55:10,410
I'm known as covering the keys because I
only have one minute left so the number

914
00:55:10,410 --> 00:55:11,569
too many questions here

915
00:55:11,569 --> 00:55:15,690
okay West legality have walking-around
money these things kinda curious

916
00:55:15,690 --> 00:55:20,089
veterans country I guess very good
question what's the legality

917
00:55:20,089 --> 00:55:23,109
I have checked and I have found one
Lauren

918
00:55:23,109 --> 00:55:26,190
Miami at this thing which people
reported

919
00:55:26,190 --> 00:55:29,819
said it's illegal to carry concealed key
this is a brown

920
00:55:29,819 --> 00:55:33,538
you have to report to concede key and a
moment arrest

921
00:55:33,539 --> 00:55:37,509
if you don't do that if and felony on
his own to have it

922
00:55:37,509 --> 00:55:40,529
a hidden key but it can be met or
whatever

923
00:55:40,529 --> 00:55:45,150
pardon this year none of this material
is illegal only carrying doing arrest

924
00:55:45,150 --> 00:55:46,979
and not reporting is illegal in Miami

925
00:55:46,979 --> 00:55:50,299
and possibly under other colors date so
check your local laws

926
00:55:50,299 --> 00:55:53,769
for carrying hidden keys I think that
would be the last question right

927
00:55:53,769 --> 00:55:59,979
want this more one person is allowed get
you

928
00:55:59,979 --> 00:56:03,599
i'm reading the phased out there are
certain who are should go there and and

929
00:56:03,599 --> 00:56:05,440
get one of the keys to orbit with

930
00:56:05,440 --> 00:56:10,039
limited supply her legalization of
informations

931
00:56:10,039 --> 00:56:13,229
legalization another question what is
legally hunted

932
00:56:13,229 --> 00:56:16,359
having information upon getting arrested

933
00:56:16,359 --> 00:56:19,808
I have I have never let up any loss
probity in

934
00:56:19,809 --> 00:56:23,319
it inroads with possibly that would be
considered lock picking tools

935
00:56:23,319 --> 00:56:28,190
saw him fall under the law blog in pools
like for example but I heard New York

936
00:56:28,190 --> 00:56:32,640
illegal to carry lockpicking pooled with
the criminal intent

937
00:56:32,640 --> 00:56:36,479
and in

938
00:56:36,479 --> 00:56:40,579
so it's a thought crime to have not been
polluted by The Temper that

939
00:56:40,579 --> 00:56:44,940
okay our reaction from the pentagon
security very proud of it he said thank

940
00:56:44,940 --> 00:56:46,159

941
00:56:46,159 --> 00:56:52,579

her life well
